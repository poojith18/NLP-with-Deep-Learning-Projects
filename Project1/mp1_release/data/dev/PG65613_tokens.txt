foreword
the
great
interest
shown
in
numismatics
and
antiquities
nowadays
has
caused
this
imperfect
endeavor
to
collate
some
of
the
interesting
historical
data
still
in
existence
regarding
the
first
united
states
mint
and
also
at
the
same
time
preserve
by
means
of
photographs
and
descriptions
the
present
appearance
of
the
old
buildings
practically
every
chronological
list
of
important
events
which
have
happened
in
the
united
states
records
the
establishment
of
the
first
united
states
mint
in
philadelphia
in
and
if
anyone
has
the
time
and
inclination
to
investigate
the
history
and
coinage
of
the
mint
for
the
first
forty
years
of
its
existence
and
publish
to
the
numismatic
world
the
result
of
his
research
i
shall
be
satisfied
if
my
efforts
here
should
furnish
the
slightest
inspiration
numismatists
very
rarely
if
ever
pay
any
attention
to
the
persons
who
made
their
rare
and
valuable
specimens
of
coins
and
probably
still
less
attention
to
the
places
where
they
were
made
the
great
majority
of
the
rare
united
states
coins
were
made
in
buildings
still
standing
at
and
north
seventh
street
philadelphia
or
to
be
more
exact
in
the
coinage
building
in
the
rear
of
these
numbers
until
recently
these
buildings
were
unmarked
and
the
people
of
the
neighborhood
in
a
great
many
instances
were
unaware
of
the
fact
that
for
a
period
of
forty
years
all
of
the
united
states
coins
were
made
so
near
at
hand
those
who
daily
walked
past
the
buildings
had
nothing
to
direct
their
attention
to
them
and
it
is
safe
to
say
that
not
five
hundred
persons
in
philadelphia
could
point
out
what
at
one
time
was
one
of
the
most
important
buildings
in
the
united
states
as
well
as
the
first
erected
under
authority
of
congress
for
federal
purposes
the
author
purchased
the
buildings
and
feels
that
it
is
his
duty
to
do
what
he
can
to
describe
them
before
they
are
demolished
and
also
at
the
same
time
publish
such
data
in
his
possession
as
may
prove
interesting
or
valuable
to
the
limited
few
who
collect
rare
coins
or
are
in
any
way
interested
in
what
was
an
exceedingly
important
department
of
our
early
national
life

for

ye

the

mint
buildings
are
indeed
historical
in
more
ways
than
one
and
while
a
number
of
suggestions
have
been
made
for
their
preservation
it
is
highly
probable
they
will
eventually
be
located
by
the
means
of
a
bronze
tablet
on
the

of
the
steel
and

structure
in

for
the
use
of

who
now
occupy
the
buildings
adjoining
them
on
the
south
and
east
the
retention
of
the
buildings
on
the
present
site
is
prohibited
on
account
of
the
great
value
of
the
land
and
its
location
in
the
heart
of
the
business
section
and
their
removal
by
private
enterprise
to
another
site
unlikely
because
of
the
great
expense
that
such
removal
would
entail
if
a
few
dollars
which
now
have
a
record
price
of
hundred
dollars
each
should
be
found
in
the
buildings
their
removal
would
be
rendered
easier
provided
they
were
found
before
the
destruction
of
the
buildings
but
this
is
highly
improbable
although
there
will
undoubtedly
be
a
few
coins
discovered
as
there
were
when
the
building
was
erected
on
the
filbert
street
lot
on
the
site
of
the
old
mint
smelting
house
which
is
contiguous
to
the
seventh
street
lot
washington
in
his
first
annual
address
to
congress
referred
to
the
importance
of
uniformity
in
the
currency
his
second
annual
address
urged
the
importance
of
the
establishment
of
a
mint
in
his
third
address
he
spoke
of
disorders
in
the
existing
currency
the
scarcity
of
change
and
recommended
carrying
into
effect
the
resolution
already
entered
into
concerning
the
establishment
of
a
mint
also
remarked
that
measures
had
been
taken
for
procuring
some
of
the
most
necessary
artists
together
with
the
necessary
apparatus
his
fourth
annual
address
referred
to
employment
of
artists
both
from
abroad
and
at
home
to
aid
in
the
establishment
of
the
mint
he
also
stated
that
provision
had
been
made
for
the
requisite
buildings
which
were
then
being
put
in
proper
condition
and
spoke
of
a
small
beginning
in
the
coinage
of
half
his
sixth
annual
address
stated
mint
had
entered
upon
the
coinage
of
the
precious
metals
and
there
was
a
pleasing
prospect
that
the
institution
would
at
no
remote
day
realize
the
expectation
which
was
originally
formed
of
its
his
seventh
annual
address
called
attention
to
necessity
of
further
legislation
for
checking
abuses
in
particular
quarters
and
for
carrying
its
business
more
completely
into
it
will
be
seen
from
reference
in
six
out
of
eight
of
his
messages
to
congress
to
the
currency
and
mint
that
he
was
deeply
interested
in
the
matter
and
considered
it
of
more
than
ordinary
importance
it
has
been
stated
that
he
was
a
frequent
visitor
to
the
mint
and
that
the
first
silver
dismes
and
half
dismes
were
made
from
silver
contributed
by
him
the
will
of
john
kates
a
former
owner
of
the
buildings
says
that
the
was
laid
by
washington
but
this
is
unlikely
as
he
was
not
in
philadelphia
the
day
on
which
it
is
supposed
to
have
been
laid
the
contents
of
the
when
found
will
undoubtedly
contain
something
of
great
interest
to
antiquarians
the
original
buildings
with
the
exception
of
the
smelting
house
still
stand
at
and
north
seventh
street
and
in
the
rear
of
these
numbers
there
were
three
different
brick
buildings
all
separated
by
yards
and
alleys
those
facing
seventh
street
were
used
for
executive
offices
etc
immediately
back
of
them
was
the
one
used
as
the
coinage
department
and
back
of
that
was
the
small
building
facing
filbert
street
and
about
twenty
feet
back
of
the
line
of
that
street
the
old
building
used
as
the
smelting
house
was
torn
down
the
latter
part
of
and
a
concrete
building
erected
on
the
site
the
frontispiece
shows
the
front
buildings
facing
seventh
street
and
the
illustration
opposite
page
the
coinage
building
back
of
them
which
is
separated
from
the
front
buildings
by
a
court
yard
feet
deep
inasmuch
as
considerable
attempt
at
ornamentation
was
made
on
the
front
of
the
coinage
building
it
is
quite
probable
that
this
was
the
first
building
erected
tradition
has
it
that
this
was
originally
three
stories
high
and
that
the
top
story
was
burned
off
if
such
was
the
case
the
third
story
was
of
wooden
construction
the
walled
up
windows
in
the
rear
show
the
window
sills
to
be
badly
charred
remains
of
old
arched
brick
vaults
still
exist
in
the
basement
of
north
seventh
street
the
building
in
the
rear
used
as
the
coinage
department
has
two
arched
and
paved
brick
vaults
in
its
basement
intact
except
the
doors
one
of
the
vaults
illustrated
opposite
page
has
a
smaller
vault
in
its
rear
end
which
was
undoubtedly
used
as
a
storage
place
for
the
most
valuable
of
the
possessions
strong
brick
arches
and
exceedingly
heavy
joists
averaging
twelve
inches
square
were
placed
in
the
basement
to
support
the
coinage
presses
above
the
building
formerly
facing
filbert
street
had
no
basement
and
when
excavations
were
made
for
the
new
building
two
old
wells
were
uncovered
one
of
which
was
four
feet
in
diameter
with
cesspool
refuse
in
the
bottom
the
other
well
was
about
seven
feet
in
diameter
and
the
bottom
was
not
reached
as
the
excavations
only
went
down
about
feet
these
wells
were
between
the
old
building
and
filbert
street
the
larger
one
was
three
or
four
feet
back
of
the
centre
of
the
property
at
north
seventh
street
and
the
other
was
just
off
the
southeast
corner
of
the
demolished
building
it
is
quite
likely
that
the
largest
well
furnished
water
for
the
distillery
of
michael
shubart
it
is
interesting
to
note
that
in
the
excavations
on
the
site
of
the
old
building
several
copper
coins
and
planchets
were
found
most
of
which
are
illustrated
opposite
page
two
worthy
of
mention
are
about
the
size
of
but
with
small
holes
in
the
centre
one
of
them
having
a
milled
edge
the
other
a
plain
edge
they
are
supposed
to
be
planchets
for
the
excessively
rare
silver
centre
cents
which
must
certainly
have
been
struck
off
at
the
mint
otherwise
the
planchets
would
not
have
been
found
there
the
author
now
has
these
finds
in
his
possession
as
well
as
a
collection
of
hand
forged
hardware
taken
off
the
old
building
on
may
the
director
of
the
mint
was
authorized
with
the
approbation
of
the
president
to
purchase
a
quantity
of
copper
for
the
coinage
of
cents
and
and
congress
also
provided
that
when
fifty
thousand
dollars
of
such
cents
and
had
been
coined
notice
should
be
given
to
the
public
in
at
least
two
newspapers
and
that
any
attempt
to
pass
other
copper
coins
would
result
in
their
forfeiture
from
a
national
viewpoint
the
old
mint
buildings
are
the
most
historical
in
the
united
states
because
they
were
the
first
erected
by
the
authority
of
the
federal
government
for
public
use
it
was
the
sole
united

to
the
was
laid

and
presumably
by
david
rittenhouse
the
celebrated
astronomer
and
philosopher
and
first
director
of
the
mint

achievements
of
rittenhouse
very
readily
place
him
in
the

distinguished
class

the
neighborhood
of
the
old
mint
is
rich
in
traditions
regarding
it
and
it
may
happen
that
when
the
buildings
are
torn
down
some
of
them
will
be
substantiated
during
the

chief
coiner
melter

at

and
as
these
gentlemen
were
the
chief
employees
of
the
mint
at
the
time
it
is
highly
probable
there
was
considerable
alarm
over
the
safety
of
the
mint
among
other
traditions
is
one
that
the
bullion
planchets
and
coins
were
walled
up
and
buried
during
this
scare
the
actions
of
the
british
at
washington
showed
their
tendency
towards
destruction
of

philadelphia
has
the
original
appointment
of
her

joseph

to
his
position
in

signed
by

she
would
not
even
allow
it

for
fear
something
might
happen
to
it
while

of
gives
the
address
of
michael
shubart
distiller
as
north
seventh
street
directory
gives
the
mint
at
north
seventh
street
which
indicates
that
a
change
of
numbers
in
the
mint
property
has
been
made
since
that
time
shubart
was
a
prominent
philadelphian
during
the
revolution
he
was
a
city
assessor
and
on
one
occasion
took
an
unconditional
oath
while
his
colleagues
made
a
reservation
in
the
elaborate
pageant
of
july
he
bore
the
standard
at
the
head
of
the
distillery
section
followed
by
other
notables
engaged
in
that
business
daniel
roberdeau
mentioned
elsewhere
as
an
owner
of
part
of
the
mint
grounds
at
one
time
was
a
of
militia
and
his
name
appears
frequently
in
the
revolutionary
annals
of
philadelphia
as
a
man
of
pronounced
ideas
and
stern
character
the
beginning
of
the
mint
establishment
may
be
traced
back
to
the
articles
of
confederation
dated
july
which
contained
the
following
united
states
in
congress
assembled
shall
also
have
the
sole
and
exclusive
right
and
power
of
regulating
the
alloy
and
value
of
coin
struck
by
their
own
authority
or
by
that
of
the
respective
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
september
contains
in
article
i
section
congress
shall
have
power
to
coin

regulate
the
value
thereof
and
of
foreign

further
state
shall
coin

bills
of
credit
make
anything
but
gold
and
silver
coin
a
tender
in
payment
of
analysis
of
the
above
will
show
the
reason
why
the
various
states
discontinued
their
own
coinage
the
continental
congress
january
instructed
robert
morris
the
financier
of
the
revolution
to
prepare
and
report
a
table
of
rates
at
which
the
different
species
of
foreign
coins
most
likely
to
circulate
within
the
united
states
should
be
received
at
the
treasury
on
january
the
week
following
he
made
a
lengthy
report
regarding
the
different
names
and
values
of
coins
then
in
use
and
the
necessity
of
a
legal
tender
he
stated
that
the
necessary
machinery
for
a
mint
could
easily
be
made
and
that
the
advantage
of
possessing
legal
money
in
preference
to
any
other
would
induce
people
to
carry
foreign
money
to
the
mint
until
a
sufficiency
were
struck
for
the
circulating
medium
and
the
remainder
of
foreign
gold
and
silver
coins
should
be
left
entirely
to
the
operations
of
commerce
as
bullion
on
april
thomas
jefferson
reported
to
the
house
of
representatives
advising
the
declination
of
the
proposition
of
john
mitchell
regarding
his
offer
to
furnish
coins
from
europe
at
a
fixed
price
per
pound
for
copper
coins
his
objections
were
that
the
opportunity
of
recoinage
of
coins
would
be
lost
and
that
in
transportation
across
the
ocean
it
would
be
subject
to
the
dangers
of
the
sea
acts
of
piracy
and
in
times
of
war
would
offer
the
sinews
of
war
to
the
enterprise
of
the
enemy
and
further
that
the
resource
of
coining
household
plate
would
be
lost
the
risk
of
counterfeiting
was
also
noted
alexander
hamilton
secretary
of
the
treasury
on
january
as
a
result
of
instructions
on
the
part
of
the
house
of
representatives
on
april
sent
a
lengthy
communication
to
it
on
establishment
of
a
this
communication
was
evidently
the
basis
for
the
act
of
congress
dated
april
establishing
the
mint
and
regulating
the
coins
of
the
united
states
the
mint
was
to
be
situated
at
the
seat
of
government
then
philadelphia
and
the
president
in
addition
to
the
authority
given
him
under
the
act
of
march
was
authorized
to
cause
to
be
provided
and
put
in
proper
condition
such
buildings
as
appeared
to
him
to
be
necessary
for
carrying
on
the
business
of
the
mint
the
act
of
march
approved
by
president
washington
authorized
the
establishment
of
a
mint
under
such
regulations
as
should
be
directed
by
law
this
act
authorized
him
to
cause
to
be
engaged
artists
and
the
procurement
of
the
necessary
apparatus
on
december
jefferson
wrote
the
president
regarding
artists
he
mentioned
that
a
certain
drotz
had
been
hired
but
after
considerable
delay
refused
to
come
to
america
and
that
our
minister
at
london
had
succeeded
in
getting
albion
coxe
who
was
probably
the
person
of
that
name
who
had
the
right
to
make
copper
coins
for
the
state
of
new
jersey
in
to
accept
the
position
as
assayer
inasmuch
as
it
was
impossible
to
secure
abroad
a
chief
coiner
of
greater
ability
than
at
home
henry
voight
who
was
temporarily
in
the
position
was
favorably
mentioned
these
two
men
were
required
to
furnish
security
in
the
sum
of
ten
thousand
dollars
each
which
neither
was
able
to
do
and
jefferson
stated
that
the
coinage
of
precious
metals
was
prevented
for
some
time
past
but
that
in
order
that
the
mint
might
not
be
entirely
idle
the
coinage
of
copper
had
been
going
on
jefferson
recommended
that
their
securities
be
lessened
by
reducing
their
responsibilities

david
rittenhouse
director
of
the
mint
reported
that
it
had
been
necessary
to
purchase
an
additional
lot
of
ground
that
nearly
one
million
of
cents
had
been
coined
and
a
beginning
made
in
the
coinage
of
precious
metals
that
nearly
ounces
of
bullion
had
been
deposited
for
coinage
and
that
a
large
parcel
of
blank
dollars
was
ready
for
coining
as
soon
as
a
more
powerful
press
could
be
finished
february
boudinot
one
of
the
congressional
committee
appointed
to
examine
and
report
on
the
state
of
the
mint
made
a
long
report
on
the
duties
and
work
of
the
various
employees
at
that
time
besides
the
buildings
at
and
north
seventh
street
now
belonging
to
the
frank
stewart
electric
company
a
lease
was
held
on
one
in
the
for
five
years
at
the
rent
of
five
shillings
per
annum
a
very
trifling
sum
indeed
there
was
more
or
less
criticism
about
the
conduct
of
the
mint
which
boudinot
explained
was
due
to
trouble
in
getting
competent
workmen
proper
materials
and
strong
apparatus
he
reported
the
lots
for
the
buildings
were
too
small
and
that
this
hindered
the
operations
and
further
that
the
frequent
breaking
of
dies
which
were
all
made
in
the
mint
caused
numerous
delays
up
to
september
the
lands
purchased
had
cost
buildings
apparatus
machines
copper
salaries
a
grand
total
of
which
he
considered
a
very
great
amount
he
remarked
that
a
great
saving
could
be
made
if
the
machinery
could
be
operated
by
water
or
steam
instead
of
manual
labor
or
that
of
horses
he
noted
that
in
case
the
projected
canal
between
the
schuylkill
and
delaware
should
be
accomplished
the
heavy
expense
of
the
mint
would
be
greatly
reduced
his
report
among
other
things
showed
that
when
the
bullion
was
not
in
use
it
was
kept
under
two
locks
the
keys
of
which
were
kept
by
the
assayer
and
chief
coiner
this
was
for
the
time
it
was
in
the
custody
of
the
chief
coiner
that
part
not
in
his
custody
was
in
the
vaults
of
the
mint
also
secured
under
two
locks
keys
of
which
were
kept
by
the
treasurer
and
assayer
mention
is
made
elsewhere
regarding
these
vaults
he
recommended
a
reduction
in
the
size
of
the
copper
cent
and
a
change
in
the
standard
for
silver
coins
to
ten
parts
silver
and
one
part
copper
henry
william
desaussure
in
a
letter
dated
the
mint
office
october
to
the
president
of
the
united
states
george
washington
apologized
for
the
length
of
his
communication
and
said
he
was
prepared
to
deliver
the
direction
of
the
mint
to
his
successor
he
stated
the
coinage
of
gold
had
begun
under
his
administration
he
deemed
it
proper
to
state
there
was
no
copper
in
the
mint
fit
for
coining
and
that
the
price
of
copper
had
advanced
and
suggested
the
desirability
of
reducing
the
weight
of
the
cent
and
thereby
help
in
preventing
its
use
by
coppersmiths
he
mentioned
the
important
fact
that
the
standard
of
the
silver
coin
in
use
at
the
mint
differed
from
the
standard
fixed
by
law
he
thought
that
either
the
law
should
be
changed
or
the
standard
used
according
to
law
he
suggested
the
desirability
of
having
laws
made
to
close
up
certain
establishments
making
debased
foreign
coins
and
thereby
curtailing
the
supply
of
gold
bullion
and
degrading
our
national
character
he
referred
to
an
attempt
on
the
mint
dies
and
implements
with
nefarious
views
elias
boudinot
in
a
letter
dated
at
the
mint
december
referred
to
the
sudden
death
of
assayer
albion
coxe
on
the
preceding
friday
and
said
this
officer
is
replaced
the
business
of
the
mint
would
be
confined
to
striking
cents
in
the
same
letter
he
recommended
among
other
things
some
proper
person
be
authorized
to
purchase
on
public
account
all
small
quantities
of
silver
and
gold
brought
to
the
mint
at
the
best
market
price
to
be
coined
for
the
public
elias
boudinot
in
a
very
able
letter
to
the
president
dated
at
the
mint
november
told
how
impossible
it
was
to
run
the
mint
with
dispatch
hampered
as
it
was
by
unreasonable
restrictions
he
pointed
out
how
in
one
case
a
depositor
of
bullion
below
standard
got
pounds
sterling
more
than
he
should
and
still
was
within
his
legal
rights
in
other
words
it
cost
the
mint
that
much
to
refine
the
bullion
for
which
it
received
no
compensation
he
also
pointed
out
how
expensive
it
was
to
coin
bullion
in
rotation
so
that
each
depositor
got
his
money
in
turn
in
this
way
it
was
just
as
expensive
to
melt
and
refine
ounces
as
ounces
and
he
recommended
a
fund
for
the
mint
to
be
used
in
paying
off
small
depositors
of
bullion
and
thus
be
able
to
melt
and
refine
in
larger
quantities
february
havens
of
the
committee
to
examine
and
report
on
letter
made
his
report
to
congress
and
recommended
the
sum
of
be
appropriated
to
make
good
the
deficiency
caused
by
wastage
in
coining
gold
and
silver
since
the
commencement
of
the
coinage
of
these
metals
the
report
was
substantially
a
confirmation
of
the
statements
made
by
boudinot
may
recommendation
of
allowance
to
john
vaughan
was
made
because
silver
bullion
to
the
extent
of
ounces
deposited
by
him
was
of
greater
fineness
than
that
regularly
used
in
coinage
during
the
latter
part
of
it
became
very
apparent
that
the
of
the
mint
was
not
sufficient
for
the
needs
of
the
country
and
foreign
coins
were
necessarily
continued
as
legal
tender
despite
legislation
to
the
contrary
elias
boudinot
in
a
letter
from
the
mint
to
the
president
dated
january
mentioned
that
during
the
previous
summer
a
scheme
for
robbing
the
mint
was
discovered
one
of
the
persons
in
the
mint
was
in
collusion
with
outside
parties
the
offenders
were
detected
prosecuted
and
punished
january
boudinot
reported
to
president
adams
and
called
his
attention
to
the
fact
that
fifty
thousand
one
hundred
and
eleven
dollars
and
cents
of
cents
had
been
coined
and
that
it
was
necessary
for
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
of
the
united
states
to
comply
with
provisions
of
law
of
may
by
giving
the
public
notice
therein
mentioned
also
brought
up
the
point
that
the
mint
was
not
at
the
seat
of
government
which
had
been
moved
to
washington
and
if
mint
was
to
be
removed
steps
should
be
taken
immediately
regarding
it
also

on

in
a
communication
to
the
secretary
of
the

calls
attention
to
outstanding
contracts
for
copper
abroad
which
were
obligatory
and
the
difficulty
attending
the
securing
of
copper
in
the
past
questioned
the
scheme
of
importing
coined
copper
cents
because
of
a
chance
of
a
flood
of
lightweight
cents
contrary

and

greater
security

to
the
probability

desired

be
invested

the
exclusive
privilege
according
to

of
furnishing
cents
of
the
regular
weight
and
quality
free
of

wrote
the
secretary
of

giving
an
inventory
of
the
real
and
personal
property
of
the
mint
as
follows
lots
on
seventh

between
market

arch
feet
each

and
extending

with
a

instead

said
lots
were
too
small
and
was
greatly
cramped
for
room
said
lots
were
then
very
valuable
being
in
the
heart
of
the
city
in
his
opinion
the
necessary
coins
of
the
government
could
not
be
protected
at
much
less
expense
than
the
mint
cost
in
this
inventory
no
mention
was
made
of
the
building
used
by
the
coinage
department
and
which
no
doubt
was
the
best
and
most
important
building
then
on
the
lots
the
sizes
of
the
lots
given
are
inaccurate
and
the
idea
evidently
intended
to
be
conveyed
was
that
there
was
very
little
of
value
in
buildings
or
equipment
in
salaries
of
the

the

were
suspended
at

times
because
of
yellow
fever
epidemics
and
this
in
connection
with
the
scarcity
of
metal
and
a
fire
at
the
mint
and
the
use
of
coins
for
purely
commercial
purposes
by
coppersmiths
silversmiths
and
other
tradesmen
accounts
for
the
scarcity
of

respecting
the
purchase
of
the

and
houses
which
are
offered
for

in

to
the

certainly
