fortune
shall
to
thee
be
told
and
to
its
praise
my
life
i
shall
thus
spake
sordino
noble
florentine
to
one
who
was
renowned
for
casting
bells
who
now
was
asked
to
make
a
set
of
chimes
a
task
he
had
accomplished
many
times
but
this
he
thought
the
highest
skill
compels
and
yet
the
work
he
promised
to
begin
but
first
for
thoughts
and
dreams
he
leisure
found
for
consecration
to
the
work
at
hand
since
this
the
glory
of
his
life
should
be
a
grand
creation
a
sweet
symphony
of
human
life
which
all
might
understand
their
souls
in
the
liquid
sound
ii
he
was
a
man
of
many
changing
moods
impetuous
like
mighty
angelo
and
kindly
like
the
saintly
raphael
his
patience
like
nought
could
quell
in
worship
like
the
good
angelico
and
yet
the
his
name
excludes
he
nature
loved
and
wandered
oft
alone
mid
deep
recesses
of
some
shady
wood
and
listened
to
the
many
varied
sounds
from
notes
of
birds
to
noise
of
baying
hounds
and
oftentimes
as
if
enraptured
stood
held
by
the
music
of
the
undertone
once
had
he
loved
a
maiden
in
whose
eyes
he
read
the
happiness
of
human
life
and
mystery
of
the
immortal
soul
a
love
to
which
he
gave
himself
and
all
with
but
one
aim
to
win
her
as
his
wife
and
realize
his
dream
of
paradise
but
death
did
also
mark
her
for
his
own
with
hectic
flushes
on
the
pallid
cheek
and
growing
languor
in
the
sprightly
limbs
and
as
the
day
before
darkness
dims
so
did
her
youthful
buoyancy
grow
weak
and
like
a
vision
fair
she
soon
was
gone
and
sorrow
with
its
wintry
blast
did
chill
his
manly
nature
to
the
very
core
and
many
months
he
spent
in
utter
woe
but
like
the
which
grows
beneath
the
snow
a
life
which
he
had
never
known
before
rose
from
submission
to
the
higher
will
these
elements
did
pass
into
his
work
his
love
and
grief
his
dreams
and
changing
moods
and
all
he
was
seemed
mingle
in
the
mold
of
molten
metal
and
was
subtly
told
by
silver
tonguéd
bells
in
solitudes
of
monastery
or
of
country
kirk
iii
as
one
who
summons
all
the
latent
within
his
soul
for
one
last
great
attempt
to
reach
an
aim
of
lifelong
beckoning
thus
did
he
give
himself
to
this
one
thing
began
his
task
in
spotless
white
and
kempt
emerging
from
the
sacramental
hour
he
days
and
nights
upon
his
labor
fixed
forgetful
both
of
hunger
and
of
sleep
his
soul
reflected
in
the
fiery
glow
and
some
did
say
he
let
his
flow
and
others
that
he
sometimes
stopped
to
weep
and
with
his
blood
and
tears
the
metal
mixed
and
when
at
last
the
chimes
were
cast
there
came
a
great
collapse
of
utter
weariness
upon
him
and
he
slept
for
many
days
the
finishing
with
all
artistic
ways
was
work
more
like
a
fond
caress
of
something
born
of
flame
the
day
of
testing
came
the
final
test
sordino
coming
early
in
the
morn
since
eager
was
his
soul
to
know
for
sooth
if
its
ideal
of
the
highest
truth
of
harmony
incarnate
can
be
born
and
with
the
works
of
man
itself
invest
and
when
two
skilful
hands
intoned
a
hymn
and
gave
the
chimes
a
chance
for
utterance
as
shining
on
a
scaffold
high
they
hung
it
seemed
to
him
it
was
by
angels
sung
so
pure
so
sweet
it
did
his
soul
entrance
and
with
the
tears
of
joy
his
eyes
make
dim
the
task
was
done
a
work
of
perfect
art
and
handsome
was
the
price
sordino
paid
a
fortune
to
the
maker
of
those
bells
of
whom
henceforth
tradition
nothing
tells
we
know
not
where
his
future
course
was
laid
nor
when
or
where
from
life
he
did
depart
iv
the
chimes
found
their
exalted
place
within
a
high
cathedral
gift
to
a
beloved
fane
of
italy
and
that
their
melodies
might
always
be
within
his
hearing
he
his
home
did
shift
from
country
silence
to
the
din
where
like
some
voices
from
an
unseen
realm
their
music
did
announce
each
fleeting
hour
to
all
the
throngs
which
moved
in
streets
below
and
as
their
harmonies
upon
the
air
did
flow
they
seemed
to
have
a
superhuman
listening
hearts
yea
even
to
overwhelm
the
meditative
mind
with
such
a
joy
of
loveliness
and
beauty
that
a
tear
would
glisten
in
the
upward
look
of
and
they
would
lift
the
heavy
loads
of
care
from
souls
oppressed
and
banish
carking
fear
and
grief
and
black
remorse
which
life
destroy
and
thus
they
day
and
night
gripped
human
souls
with
hope
and
cheer
mid
divers
pursuits
but
on
the
sabbath
and
the
sacred
days
when
man
is
called
to
think
of
better
ways
they
seemed
so
jubliant
with
heavenly
truths
that
none
did
doubt
that
god
his
children
calls
they
had
a
gladness
which
at
sundry
times
was
almost
riotous
like
play
and
seemed
to
send
out
peals
of
laughter
sweet
when
they
a
merry
bridal
train
did
greet
as
to
the
church
it
gaily
made
its
way
transported
with
the
rapture
of
the
chimes
but
when
the
dead
were
carried
to
their
rest
its
dirges
were
of
all
most
wonderful
a
depth
of
sadness
such
as
none
can
tell
a
sadness
which
the
gayest
did
compel
to
see
a
shadow
of
the
ghastly
skull
and
yet
to
feel
that
even
the
grave
is
blest
v
in
all
these
cadences
sordino
found
a
true
delight
but
most
in
solemn
dirge
for
melancholy
was
his
common
mood
though
sometimes
he
was
in
an
altitude
of
such
hilarity
that
it
did
verge
upon
the
wildness
of
a
mind
unsound
indeed
the
whisper
passed
he
was
insane
since
only
one
with
shattered
reason
could
half
of
his
fortune
spend
for
such
a
thing
to
hear
a
set
of
golden
churchbells
ring
and
none
of
his
few
friends
quite
understood
his
pleasure
in
a
funeral
refrain
he
loved
to
walk
tombs
and
ancient
graves
and
read
the
epitaphs
on
crumbling
stones
or
muse
beside
some
gloomy
cypress
tree
while
to
a
mournful
melody
mark
how
the
harmony
of
all
the
tones
did
vanish
far
away
sunlit
waves
he
was
a
seeker
after
harmony
such
harmony
in
which
all
life
shall
blend
in
perfect
peace
and
concord
this
he
heard
expressed
in
those
deep
tones
which
moved
and
stirred
his
brooding
mind
and
seemed
an
answer
lend
to
all
its
questions
of
destiny
unhappiness
had
marred
his
early
life
his
marriage
to
a
girl
who
loved
him
not
and
yet
who
lived
within
his
childless
home
for
binding
was
the
tie
once
made
by
rome
until
at
last
her
ways
became
a
blot
and
by
her
sins
she
ceased
to
be
his
wife
since
then
he
lived
a
recluse
more
or
less
except
when
with
him
met
to
dine
or
rather
to
a
revelry
when
wine
and
music
set
his
spirit
free
when
he
disappointments
could
forget
and
when
some
transient
bliss
he
did
caress
but
feasts
of
such
a
nature
yearly
grew
less
frequent
for
his
real
self
was
good
and
governed
him
as
he
in
age
advanced
and
now
the
chimes
his
being
so
entranced
that
all
the
hunger
of
his
heart
found
food
in
their
sweet
intonations
ever
new
they
fed
his
innate
philosophic
bent
and
made
him
delve
into
the
subtlest
lore
of
metaphysics
and
theology
that
he
through
these
perchance
might
clearer
see
the
truth
which
echoed
from
another
shore
each
time
their
sovereign
voice
the
silence
rent
and
he
waxed
confident
the
human
cry
is
wafted
somewhere
to
a
higher
sphere
where
it
is
answered
with
a
perfect
peace
that
not
a
soul
from
earth
does
find
release
release
from
darkness
and
the
night
of
fear
without
a
morn
of
better
hope
on
high
vi
the
grave
has
after
all
the
truest
peace
the
graveyard
is
the
greatest
moralist
and
it
was
wisdom
that
in
days
of
eld
the
living
with
the
dead
communion
held
for
they
did
worship
in
their
very
midst
a
custom
which
in
our
good
times
must
cease
no
longer
can
we
lay
our
dead
within
the
shadow
of
the
church
but
far
away
in
some
secluded
spot
where
seldom
seen
is
their
last
beneath
the
green
where
some
good
farmer
makes
his
loads
of
hay
and
murmurs
that
it
is
in
places
thin
we
do
not
in
this
shallow
age
endure
to
think
of
death
such
thoughts
do
not
amuse
but
mock
the
things
which
we
are
striving
after
it
tickles
not
our
vein
of
silly
laughter
the
subject
is
unpleasant
and
obtruse
of
which
the
preachers
even
are
not
sure
the
graveyard
is
preaching
more
to
thinking
minds
than
many
homilies
it
tells
in
no
uncertain
language
of
the
vanity
in
all
which
here
we
love
that
all
our
restless
seeking
after
bliss
is
but
the
drifting
to
another
shore
that
men
and
empires
have
their
little
day
then
turn
to
dust
as
others
have
before
that
death
is
still
the
monarch
of
the
world
before
whose
feet
all
things
at
last
are
hurled
before
whose
realm
there
is
no
closing
door
and
has
for
all
but
one
sad
darksome
way
vii
of
all
the
seasons
of
the
year
none
to
melancholy
people
like
the
fall
that
is
to
persons
of
poetic
mind
for
in
this
season
they
a
beauty
find
in
earth
and
sky
which
is
transcending
all
the
wondrous
glory
of
the
summer
gone
for
all
its
mellow
beauty
has
a
sadness
twixt
tears
and
smiles
a
sadness
seen
and
heard
in
varied
aspects
and
its
notes
upon
the
dim
haziness
it
floats
the
shrill
cry
of
the
migratory
bird
and
tunes
of
in
their
gladness
in
the
fatal
drooping
of
the
flower
in
the
stubble
of
the
fields
and
meads
where
crickets
hold
a
concert
day
and
night
in
the
shadow
and
its
flight
across
the
waters
and
the
sighing
reeds
in
the
gold
and
crimson
of
the
bower
in
the
rain
that
strikes
against
the
pane
and
leaves
its
diamonds
on
the
bending
straw
in
the
mist
which
follows
nightly
shower
a
floating
mantle
of
the
morning
hour
in
the
swelling
brooks
which
onward
go
with
mystic
songs
to
the
majestic
main
and
melancholy
is
the
truth
said
one
whose
genius
pierced
through
the
life
of
man
who
hated
cant
deriding
the
tartuffe
and
saw
beneath
the
robe
the
hoof
a
wandering
exile
from
his
native
land
the
fascinating
bard
the
great
byron
forgive
o
lustrous
name
that
i
should
use
thy
music
for
a
lyre
so
poorly
strung
but
i
did
often
in
my
youth
even
now
admire
the
glory
of
his
laurelled
brow
and
felt
that
truth
and
freedom
was
sung
as
by
this
highpriest
of
the
muse
o
all
ye
learned
critics
of
his
art
who
analyze
by
a
mechanic
rule
ye
fail
to
see
the
grandeur
of
his
soul
that
soared
above
the
petty
and
the
small
indifferent
to
the
existing
school
preferring
pegasus
to
any
cart
with
the
sublime
he
ever
was
in
tune
alpen
heights
or
on
boundless
deep
or
the
storm
and
thunders
crash
in
darkest
night
lit
by
the
flash
or
on
the
plains
where
vanished
empires
sleep
desolation
a
waning
moon
his
harp
did
catch
the
minor
flow
from
heart
and
human
tragedy
and
when
he
laughed
it
was
the
smile
though
he
at
heart
was
tender
as
a
child
but
death
to
him
had
sweeter
harmony
than
brief
dream
with
its
relentless
woe
likewise
sordino
after
years
of
thinking
found
in
the
dirge
the
acme
of
his
search
the
to
a
truer
beginning
when
man
shall
cease
from
sorrow
and
from
sinning
the
great
the
final
welcome
of
the
church
the
note
of
peace
which
to
earth
is
linking
viii
at
length
there
came
upon
city
an
enemy
with
armies
great
and
strong
and
laid
a
siege
about
its
buttressed
walls
and
since
the
strongest
bulwark
sometime
falls
before
a
cannonading
fierce
and
long
so
did
its
without
pity
the
conqueror
did
loot
and
kill
and
ravage
while
it
all
the
chimes
sang
forth
the
hour
in
notes
which
shamed
the
horror
of
that
day
and
as
he
listened
said
them
away
their
music
hath
upon
my
men
a
which
makes
a
saint
out
of
a
bloody
savage
then
from
the
lofty
they
were
removed
against
pleadings
these
to
spare
and
carried
hence
none
but
the
victor
knew
and
captive
toilers
whom
at
last
he
slew
their
value
he
surmised
and
used
such
care
as
for
their
preservation
it
behooved
ix
o
heinous
war
very
incarnation
whose
countenance
is
black
with
darkest
hate
whose
eyes
have
gleam
of
greed
and
lust
and
fiendish
satisfaction
when
the
dust
of
fair
earth
with
precious
blood
is
sate
who
laughs
at
the
destruction
of
a
nation
whose
breath
is
fumes
and
dire
disease
and
darting
flames
devouring
abodes
whose
voice
with
terror
fills
all
living
things
and
nought
attracts
except
the
wings
its
rending
roar
the
very
heaven
goads
until
the
cloud
flees
whose
brutish
hands
with
gore
and
grime
polluted
are
strangling
innocents
and
ripping
wombs
and
gagging
cry
and
sundering
the
maiden
from
her
mother
plundering
the
aged
and
the
sick
yea
even
the
tombs
of
those
are
by
this
monster
looted
it
rules
the
empires
and
it
rules
the
seas
it
is
the
prince
of
power
in
the
air
and
kings
and
nations
worship
it
with
fear
but
drunk
with
blood
they
loud
and
wildly
cheer
and
think
its
glory
great
beyond
compare
yea
worth
all
loss
and
human
miseries
o
christ
who
stood
on
galilee
reproaching
evil
saying
be
still
so
all
the
fury

the
storm

struggling

thou
again

word

x
sordino
from
the
fated
city
fled
when
he
beheld
hand
engaged
in
vandalism
on
the
house
of
god
it
seemed
to
him
an
awful
because
of
sin
which
heaven
had
enraged
for
which
the
blood
of
thousands
now
was
shed
when
he
perceived
resistance
was
in
vain
the
doom
declared
in
blood
and
fire
he
left
it
under
cover
of
the
night
with
thousand
others
pausing
in
his
flight
he
saw
the
flames
from
the
cathedral
spire
leap
the
angry
clouds
of
storm
and
rain
he
first
sought
safety
at
his
a
villa
rich
in
orchard
and
in
field
where
he
did
shelter
homeless
refugees
and
here
for
many
days
they
lived
in
peace
until
the
country
too
itself
must
yield
and
valiant
men
before
the
foe
retreat
we
will
not
here
relate
the
trend
sufficient
that
at
last
the
enemy
was
driven
from
the
land
by
armies
strong
and
as
in
days
of
the
heroic
song
with
plunder
rich
across
the
stormy
sea
they
to
their
shores
the
course
did
wend
deep
sadness
fell
upon
heart
for
all
the
sorrow
of
his
countrymen
for
all
the
ravages
wrought
by
the
foe
but
most
of
all
his
cup
seemed
overflow
with
grief
beyond
the
measure
of
our
ken
because
he
from
his
chimes
did
have
to
part
he
restless
grew
no
place
found
him
content
no
pleasure
could
his
spirit
satisfy
his
former
love
of
study
him
forsook
and
on
nature
he
did
cease
to
look
with
that
true
heartfelt
joy
of
years
gone
by
his
days
in
gloom
and
ennui
were
spent
at
last
he
in
his
heart
resolved
to
go
upon
a
journey
he
knew
hardly
where
in
quest
of
his
beloved
bells
though
none
for
certain
seemed
to
know
where
they
had
gone
still
he
would
travel
over
land
and
mere
with
this
resolve
his
soul
was
soon
aglow
xi
to
france
he
first
of
all
did
make
his
way
enduring
hardship
on
the
boistrous
sea
and
dangers
on
the
shores
of
sullen
foes
but
since
to
hearts
of
purpose
strong
no
woes
insufferable
seem
thus
agony
of
any
kind
could
not
his
zeal
allay
he
reached
the
wondrous
city
of
the
seine
the
metropole
of
art
and
modes
where
ever
dazzling
show
and
pleasure
sweet
like
youths
in
grove
alaughing
meet
where
grecian
deities
have
their
abodes
and
genius
hath
reared
a
matchless
fane
a
a
the
louvre
where
stands
the
armless
venus
unto
whom
poor
heine
cried
for
help
but
none
received
since
pagan
culture
is
quite
impotent
to
save
a
soul
in
doubt
and
error
spent
though
for
poor
heine
none
needs
to
be
grieved
whose
glory
mingles
with
the
maid
of
foam
great
paris
scene
of
most
momentous
deeds
far
reaching
consequences
to
the
race
where
monarchs
died
like
vilest
criminals
while
anarchy
did
sing
her
bacchanals
and
trampled
in
the
mire
what
once
did
grace
the
highest
places
and
most
hallowed
creeds
where
great
napoleon
a
demigod
ascended
to
the
pinnacle
of
fame
and
most
dread
who
made
the
monarchs
quail
before
his
genius
until
a
wail
of
anguish
rose
mid
ruin
and
the
shame
of
empires
struck
by
avenging
rod
but
even
his
greatness
could
not
have
its
sway
equilibriums
by
ages
fixed
his
life
was
like
the
wierd
and
dazzling
light
of
some
stray
star
in
its
erratic
flight
or
like
the
image
where
the
metals
mixed
the
gold
and
silver
with
ignoble
clay
the
head
of
gold
the
feet
of
clay
and
so
the
little
stone
of
fate
the
giant
felled
the
star
erratic
into
exile
sent
its
lustre
in
ignominy
misspent
still
it
had
closed
an
age
whose
doom
was
spelled

free
the
tyrant
too
must
go
but
this
was
not
the
france
sordino
knew
long
time
before
the
corsican
he
lived
ere
france
had
lost
her
faith
in
monks
and
nuns
while
chiming
bells
were
more
than
roaring
guns
and
in
their
potency
the
land
believed
rejoicing
that
their
faith
was
true
his
life
fell
in
the
days
of
charles
the
great
when
wars
were
pleasant
pastime
for
the
kings
who
fought
for
many
reasons
quite
terrestrial
but
sometimes
as
they
thought
for
things
celestial
and
nothing
like
the
latter
valor
brings
inspired
by
bigotry
and
hellish
hate
when
france
was
warring
for
her
very
life
and
guise
the
mighty
lion
held
at
bay
when
florence
beat
her
foe
at
marciano
and
poor
sordino
lost
his
sweet
campana
in
that
age
he
lived
and
made
his
way
to
paris
weary
from
the
worldly
strife
he
traveled
like
a
scholar
incognito
and
sought
the
company
of
learned
men
disputing
with
them
in
the
classic
lore
this
helped
him
churchly
places
to
explore
where
might
have
been
perchance
a
den
since
that
of
old
has
ever
had
a
ditto
house
ye
made
a
den
of
thieves
said
christ
to
priests
who
wrought
for
him
a
cross
but
afterwards
full
often
in
his
name
the
priesthood
has
been
guilty
of
the
same
what
was
a
sister
grievous
loss
they
proudly
stored
in
dusky
sacristies
such
was
the
plunder
of
the
noble
art
which
philip
from
the
netherlands
did
take
such
too
the
treasures
which
napoleon
with
ruthless
warfare
from
the
nations
won
thus
ever
where
the
priest
his
sign
doth
make
upon
the
sin
which
pierced
the
sacred
heart
such
guilt
may
even
in
times
have
rested
upon
some
parisian
church
or
abbey
in
its
strange
seclusiveness
but
everywhere
he
found
but
weariness
resulting
from
his
all
persistent
search
and
nowhere
did
he
see
nor
hear
his
chimes
xii
why
should
a
soul
consume
its
power
and
peace
in
quest
of
that
which
useless
seems

of
ideals

endure
the
cruel

through
dun
and

wilds
pathless
hills

afar

then
points
to
a
dim
and
distant
star
with
faith
like
a
little
while
spectral

round
soul
is
thronging
because
a
gleam
as
from
a
fiery
globe
illumined
souls
before
their
incarnation
and
bound
them
with
chain
eternally
that
face
for
ever
they
might
see
and
be
happy
in
their
earthly
station
unless
their

in
pure
light

this
gleam
was
ever
glowing
in
the

of
him
whom
men
might
say
was
sense
the
light
of
beauty
and
a
since
folk
may
now
his
acts
reprove
and
fearing
this
we
shall
the
tale
condense
of
what
took
place
before
he
did
depart
one
day
he
met
a
scholar
from
vienna
whose
home
was
on
the
banks
of
that
fair
stream
renowned
in
history
and
song
whose
blue
waters
as
they
flow
along
some
olden
romance
hovers
like
a
dream
in
saffron
hues
of
terra
di
sienna
there
traveled
with
this
scholar
a
young
woman
whose
beauty
smote
sordino
at
first
sight
and
made
him
captive
unaware
how
strange
since
he
had
thought
himself
outside
the
range
now
two
score
ten
of
the
wildest
flight
of
any
arrow
from
the
little
but
such
is
man
who
thinks
he
knows
himself
and
like
sordino
very
much
besides
quite
fortified
by
splendid
armor
who
thinks
his
heart
is
dead
to
any
charmer
will
suddenly
discover
that
there
hides
within
its
chambers
still
a
little
elf
she
was
a
coy
elusive
little
creature
uncaptured
yet
by
suitors
manifold
her
only
child
and
motherless
whose
cheerfulness
his
saddened
heart
did
bless
whose
eyes
of
danube
blue
and
hair
of
gold
commingled
with
her
grecian
feature
she
was
proficient
in
the
classic
learning
read
greek
and
latin
like
her
native
tongue
italian
too
and
did
on
dante
dote
and
metaphysics
studied
but
by
rote
for
mental
subtleties
she
was
too
young
and
was
to
songs
too
often
turning
anacreon
she
knew
by
heart
and
set
his
lyric
and
erotic
odes
to
tunes
and
most
of
all
she
did
with
fondness
love
his
ἐραςμίη
πέλεια
the
dove
of
venus
odorous
with
sweet
perfumes
her
payment
for
the
canzonet
and
like
an
amathusia
she
seemed
to
fond
sordino
who
had
beheld
such
loveliness
of
mind
and
body
wed
and
then
he
knew
that
the
past
and
dead
of
his
own
life
no
being
had
compelled
his
love
like
she
whom
he
a
goddess
deemed
but
when
he
saw
her
jealous
care
he
did
not
dare
his
hand
to
tender
her
but
first
of
all
sought
to
ingratiate
himself
to
both
but
most
to
the
sedate
pedantic
scholar
ready
to
concur
in
all
his
views
though
fallacy
lay
bare
thus
suavity
did
win
the
learned
man
and
he
became
ardent
friend
and
asked
him
to
return
with
them
to
wien
another
thing
he
failed
not
to
agree
in
and
when
their
stay
in
paris
had
an
end
he
gladly
journeyed
with
this
austrian
xiii
on
shores
wooded
hills
a
villa
was
smiling
welcome
to
its
lord
and
guest
but
most
of
all
to
her
whose
name
was
stella
her
father
called
her
for
whom
the
servants
ready
had
ein
fest
where
once
encamped
the
hosts
of
attila
a
florentine
among
teutonic
scenes
led
thither
by
a
love
yet
unexpressed
forgot
his
sorrows
yea
forgot
his
bells
since
nought
like
love
its
victim
so
compels
to
full
submission
to
a
sweet
behest
the
looks
and
smiles
of
one
still
in
her
teens
her
beauty
was
the
centre
of
all
scenes
her
voice
the
only
music
of
each
sound
her
presence
sole
embodiment
of
bliss
and
heaven
itself
it
would
have
been
a
kiss
for
which
the
shibboleth
he
had
not
found
behind
the
and
screens
on
horseback
did
they
sometimes
ride
along
the
winding
roads
and
most
in
early
morn
while
yet
the
dew
was
trembling
on
the
blade
and
all
the
minstrelsy
of
dreamy
glade
was
like
a
stream
elysian
to
them
borne
with
pure
delight
estranged
to
earthly
wrong
and
sometimes
on
the
noble
breast
they
sailed
below
the
stately
castle
walls
or
hoary
ruins
on
cliffs
of
ancient
lore
the
sacred
hieroglyphs
upon
whose
mystery
the
moonlight
falls
with
which
age
of
knighthood
blessed
such
are
those
of
famous
dürrenstein
which
once
imprisoned
richard
lionhearted
returning
from
a
holy
pilgrimage
the
english
lion
in
an
unknown
cage
for
his
minstrel
from
whom
he
had
parted
knew
not
what
walls
his
good
lord
did
confine
but
he
the
faithful
blondel
sought
him
long
and
traveled
in
disguise
through
germany
until
he
learned
of
some
great
personage
on
whom
king
leopold
had
wreaked
his
rage
and
now
he
sought
this
place
most
eagerly
without
an
aid
or
weapon
but
a
song
a
song
which
he
together
with
the
king
had
made
one
night
among
judean
hills
a
ballad
full
of
stirring
of
crusaders
in
strife
with
saracens
of
victories
defeats
and
untold
ills
and
this
below
the
he
now
did
sing
and
in
the
stillness
of
the
summer
night
his
voice
rose
clear
up
to
the
battlement
but
none
did
deem
it
but
a
common
lay
except
the
one
who
watched
a
ray
of
one
bright
star
to
him
the
ascent
came
like
angels
on
the
gleam
of
light
he
reached
the
middle
of
his
song
and
ceased
then
harkened
for
an
answer
from
the
when
all
at
once
he
heard
his
voice
conclude
the
lay
it
made
his
heart
rejoice
he
homeward
sped
and
soon
a
power
the
monarch
from
captivity
released
this
story
stella
told
the
florentine
who
found
it
charming
in
her
quaint
italian
but
would
have
substituted
some
fair
lady
for
doughty
richard
though
perhaps
more
shady
if
held
a
ransom
by
a
noble
villain
found
by
her
lover
while
she
did
repine
a
thing
she
disagreed
with
very
strongly
since
heroes
she
preferred
to
amorettes
and
poets
singing
monarchs
out
of
prison
to
luting
minstrels
whose
mission
is
sentimental
ditties
and
regrets
though
she
in
heart
felt
this
was
stated
wrongly
and
such
is
after
all
a
heart
unknown
to
her
unsearchable
to
man
it
quotes
one
thing
while
feeling
quite
another
though
guileless
like
a
sister
to
her
brother
her
head
and
heart
are
like
a
sprightly
span
of
untrained
colts
which
ever
pull
apart
but
we
must
shun
continuous
digression
and
turn
to
him
the
hero
of
our
tale
who
made
the
rather
sad
discovery
that
stella
did
worship
chivalry
but
not
in
men
of
fifty
though
all
hale
for
he
received
a
to
his
confession
her
heart
cleaved
to
a
youth
in
far
off
land
a
youth
of
prowess
in
her
cause
though
not
bethrothed
she
hoped
the
day
would
come
when
that
should
be
in
her
home
this
to
sordino
a
great
sorrow
was
since
he
had
hoped
to
win
her
heart
and
hand
he
said
adieu
to
these
his
friends
by
chance
and
drew
away
he
cared
but
little
whither
since
wounded
love
has
lost
its
grip
on
life
and
sees
it
like
a
night
with
horror
rife
until
the
victim
on
some
morning
blither
does
damn
such
meetings
as
that
one
in
france
for
men
at
fifty
may
as
truly
love
as
boys
of
fifteen
and
a
little
truer
and
disappointed
feel
the
keenest
pang
but
yet
i
have
not
heard
a
suitor
hang
himself
because
he
flatly
failed
to
woo
her
nor
worth
the
while
with
rivals
have
a
row
for
wisdom
grows
with
years
and
manly
reason
becomes
the
of
the
wanderer
and
man
doth
cease
to
be
a
slave
for
which
she
may
despise
him
as
a
knave
the
she
made
doth
ponder
her
and
knows
beneath
her
love
is
sometimes
treason
xiv
vienna
has
a
noble
shrine
then
it
vied
in
glory
with
all
fanes
stephen
thither
did
he
go
one
day
to
see
its
beauty
more
perchance
to
pray
for
he
would
fain
seek
solace
the
manes
of
the
departed
than
the
crowds
of
men
there
in
the
dimness
of
the
lofty
nave
he
tarried
long
and
mused
upon
the
past
on
visored
knights
who
thither
came
to
find
forgiveness
and
assurance
to
their
mind
that
god
did
sanction
that
their
lot
was
cast
with
them
who
fought
for
the
grave
their
sacred
task
he
almost
envied
them
to
have
a
noble
aim
and
be
assured
that
heaven
its
benediction
on
it
smiles
and
loving
hearts
are
with
the
weary
miles
for
such
a
quest
all
things
might
be
endured
and
death
itself
be
great
diadem
a
mission
and
a
love

all
a
man
should
crave
for
earthly
happiness
sordino
thought
while
absently
his
gaze
did
fall
upon
the
sweet
face
and
he
had
none
of
these
to
lift
and
bless
his
aimless
dark
and
soul
he
humbly
knelt
before
the
ancient
altar
a
stranger
mid
the
holy
solitude
but
what
he
said
in
must
not
be
told
to
all
the
world
whose
cynic
smile
is
cold
sufficient
that
the
saviour
on
the
rood
imparted
strength
to
him
who
seemed
to
falter
just
then
a
bell
rang
from
the
tower
with
notes
akin
to
one
of
his
lost
chimes
reminding
him
of
his
neglected
quest
he
rose
as
if
by
a
new
zeal
possest
as
when
a
mountaineer
who
upward
climbs
is
fascinated
by
the
power
xv
that
night
he
had
a
dream
in
which
he
heard
the
music
of
his
bells
across
the
seas
whose
notes
came
clearly
from
a
purple
haze
and
wandered
with
the
breeze
from
place
to
place
with
the
wild
caprice
and
mingled
with
the
cries
of
many
a
bird
and
floated
round
a
sail
flapping
listening
between
and
eager
to
depart
for
that
fair
land
whence
came
the
music
on
whose
purple
strand
the
ocean
shifted
from
the
dazzling
sheen
to
emerald
and
amethystine
pale
and
in
the
stern
the
smiling
stella
stood
to
come
with
her
away
and
he
did
hasten
to
the
rocky
shore
but
as
he
reached
it
she
was
there
no
more
the
ship
had
carried
her
far
out
the
bay
and
in
its
wake
the
waves
were
red
as
blood
then
did
he
weep
until
a
gentle
hand
was
laid
upon
his
head
now
bending
low
and
looking
up
a
stranger
met
his
eye
who
said
art
thou
here
why
dost
thou
cry
the
melodies
which
the
waters
go
proceed
from
chimes
made
in
thy
native
land
thy
own
they
are
go
seek
them
till
thou
findest
then
is
thy
journey
ended
and
the
strife
then
shalt
thou
know
the
joy
which
heaven
will
give
so
overwhelming
that
thou
canst
not
live
now
henceforth
thou
must
sacrifice
thy
life
to
those
who
bear
the
cross
our
god
is
when
from
his
dream
he
woke
he
pondered
long
its
meaning
and
at
last
waxed
confident
it
was
an
angel
that
had
spoken
thus
for
calling
in
distress
god
heareth
us
his
unseen
ministers
to
us
are
sent
to
give
us
light
and
weeping
change
to
song
he
also
felt
assured
his
chimes
had
found
a
place
across
the
seas
though
not
in
france
may
be
in
england
or
some
british
isle
this
thought
provoked
a
melancholy
smile
for
fame
and
knightly
lance
and
song
were
with
it
bound
and
he
determined
to
depart
full
soon
yet
one
thing
did
his
heart
desire
to
see
the
face
of
stella
which
both
night
and
day
did
follow
him
he
turned
his
way
her
in
his
dream
might
mean
to
be
a
change
of
mind
before
another
moon
yea
might
he
but
behold
those
eyes
once
more
receive
again
one
look
of
kindliness
and
feast
his
famished
heart
upon
her
beauty
and
hear
her
speak
as
once
forgetting
duty
and
give
him
one
adieu
of
hope
to
bless
then
would
he
seek
his
chimes
on
any
shore

man
is
ever

why
not
let
lore

ages
reign
the
lore
of
fairy
and
of
a
world
of
strange
imaginary
things
which
gave
to
human
mind
its
soaring
wings
and
bore
the
simplest
to
a
golden
strand

then
the

mansions
lighted
by

magic

but
without
fairies
and
a
glowing

age
was
not
like
ours
of
engines
no
kipling
to
bid
romance
a
farewell
no
wonders
in
the
realm
of
rods
and
wheels
no
squeaking
phonographs
and
chaplin
reels
no
railroads
autos
and
what
was
as
well
no
zeppelins
no
bombs
and
submarines
his
was
the
vanished
day
of
simple
living
of
faith
in
man
and
things
unseen
when
next
footstool
poet
prophet
stood
and
told
that
all
which
makes
man
glad
is
good
that
ever
tree
of
life
is
green
and
to
the
world
its
leaves
of
healing
giving
and
such
a
leaf
was
any
happy
dream
an
omen
or
a
message
from
beyond
as
truly
as
in
good
hellenic
days
when
at
the
cave
men
found
their
ways
and
to
sordino
its
illusion
fond
became
a
prophecy
a
guiding
gleam
xvii
a
catholic
he
was
and
had
his
passport
and
did
not
fear
to
take
a
ship
for
london
though
rumor
owned
it
things
were
lively
there
and
travellers
had
better
take
a
care
where
ruled
with
fierce
abandon
suspecting
strangers
to
be
of
the
base
sort
the
base
sort
being
chiefly
protestant
or
sympathizers
with
the
cause
of
cranmer
and
since
he
was
not
either
he
might
venture
to
see
the
city
without
fearing
censure
and
so
at
last
he
started
out
to
wander
through
germany
whose
scenes
did
him
enchant
at
last
he
reached
the
port
of
old
calais
and
bought
a
passage
the
english
channel
according
as
the
angel
had
him
bidden
believing
that
his
chimes
were
used
or
hidden
in
london
town
where
back
of
pane
or
panel
seek
and
find
them
on
some
happy
day
now
as
the
wind
bore
gently
the
sail
and
slowly
eked
their
distance
from
the
shore
the
western
sun
lay
ruddy
on
the
wave
his
dream
thereby
made
real
all
things
save
the
one
whose
face
his
heart
did
still
adore
she
was
not
there
this
pilgrim
strange
to
hail
upon
him
fell
a
sadness
which
alone
the
homeless
longing
traveller
doth
know
augmented
by
a
disappointed
love
and
standing
musing
at
the
prow
the
only
thing
his
wistful
vision
saw
was
that
red
glow
which
on
the
water
shone
he
stood
there
when
the
evening
shadows
fell
and
darkening
rose
coast
he
stood
there
when
the
night
closed
from
his
view
the
shores
of
france
within
the
deepest
blue
through
which
a
light
the
uttermost
was
smiling
him
a
dubious
farewell
he
stood
there
when
the
waves
began
to
roll
the
wind
to
sigh
and
whine
in
sail
and
rope
and
night
closed
round
him
with
forebodings
dark
of
dangers
for
the
rocking
little
bark
on
which
full
many
souls
now
stayed
their
hope
that
it
would
bear
them
to
their
goal
but
he
feared
not
no
rather
pleasure
found
in
the
arising
fury
of
the
deep
since
it
expressed
the
sorrow
of
his
soul
and
he
did
hear
its
wild
alluring
call
into
its
mystic
rest
at
once
to
leap
a
rest
beneath
the
angry
sound
and
now
the
elements
did
more
and
more
unstop
their
the
loud
diapason
the
shriek
of
wailing
wind
the
flopping
and
the
creak
of
rigging
and
the
rain
upon
the
seas
the
hiss
and
surging
roar
but
all
of
this
his
heart
enjoyed
with
glee
and
he
refused
to
leave
his
lonely
post
though
drenched
and
clinging
to
the
railing
a
good
old
ship
though
sorely
tried
yet
sailing
it
was
her
sturdy
boast
that
she
could
weather
even
the
roughest
sea
sordino
heard
in
all
the
symphony
of
stormy
mood
the
misery
and
rage
pent
up
in
her
great
heart
like
his
thus
all
its
terror
was
to
him
a
bliss
he
heard
in
it
majestic
melody
since
all
universe
is
harmony
the
wind
grew
chilly
and
at
last
him
drove
into
the
hold
where
slumber
soon
him
claimed
and
when
the
morning
dawned
the
ship
was
near
the
cliffs
of
england
this
a
grateful
tear
brought
from
the
anxious
hearts
which
almost
shamed
sordino
whom
this
sight
left
quite
unmoved

awaking

its
rusty

with

all
with

and

at

for
mastery
but
through
its
hope
and
fear
its
love
and
hating
the
nation
with
its
rulers
vacillating
there
came
the
age
when
light
gained
victory
and
freedom
through
the
songs
of
shakespear
breathing
that
freedom
then
as
ever
bathed
in
blood
and
tried
by
fiery
fagot
and
the
stake
the
freedom
of
the
soul
to
trow
and
live
as
christ
commanded
that
men
should
give
like
he
their
lives
for
his
own
sake
for
none
was
free
as
he
upon
the
rood
the
voice
of
freedom
whispered
through
the
world
like
breezes
of
advancing
spring
which
wake
the
modest
crocus
the
hills
and
violets
along
the
laughing
rills
and
bid
returning
music
ring
through
budding
woodlands
by
the
mist
impearled
thus
voice
did
wake
the
souls
of
men
the
lowly
and
the
mighty
felt
its
power
but
most
the
pure
in
heart
who
saw
their
god
their
hearts
rejoiced
the
scourging
rod
alone
they
stood
in
dark
hour
but
in
a
strength
which
heaven
did
grant
them
then
xix
sordino
came
to
london
just
in
time
to
view
a
drama
not
unseldom
seen
by
englishmen
in
mary
reign
who
left
upon
her
page
a
stain
so
dark
and
bloody
that
scarce
any
queen
has
ever
steeped
her
rule
in
fouler
crime
from
newgate
prison
in
the
early
morn
an
old
decrepit
man
was
rudely
led
amid
the
gibes
and
scoffings
of
a
mob
which
drowned
the
words
of
pity
and
the
sob
abuses
fell
upon
his
hoary
head
but
for
his
master
they
were
gladly
borne
they
brought
him
to
an
open
square
where
stood
an
upright
stake
with
iron
rings
and
chains
awaiting
his
frail
body
to
entwine
and
round
about
were
twigs
of
birch
and
pine
piled
up
in
bundles
groaning
with
the
pains
they
should
inflict
on
one
whose
life
was
good
the
rising
sun
cast
on
the
earth
a
soft
warm
trembling
light
cherubim
who
told
to
all
whose
soul
had
vision
is
love
at
least
one
marked
it
smiled
and
looked
above
into
infinity
of
blue
and
gold
and
as
his
eyes
were
lifted
thus
aloft
he
said
profit
hath
a
man
if
he
should
gain
the
entire
world
and
lose
his
soul
what
can
he
give
for
it
in
true
exchange
this
is
the
truth
which
saves
or
doth
avenge
and
now
as
i
am
here
to
give
my
all
i
thank
thee
father
for
the
a
which
followed
was
by
clamor
drowned
the
torch
applied
set
loose
the
crackling
flame
which
leaped
about
his
limbs
and
to
his
face
extinguishing
the
glory
of
his
gaze
and
silencing
the
lisping
of
his
name
who
hath
with
immortality
him
crowned
xx
i
said
sordino
was
a
catholic
but
more
than
that
a
true
philosopher
and
at
this
sight
within
himself
he
mused
is
the
gospel
of
the
christ
abused
by
those
who
should
its
saving
love
confer
upon
a
world
with
sin
and
hatred
sick
light
of
love
changed
into
flames
of
hell
the
praise
of
joy
to
wails
of
agony
the
cross
into
a
fetish
of
dark
fear
around
the
which
the
fiendish
demons
leer
while
erring
souls
are
shackled
to
the
tree
and
fagots
blaze
amid
the
terrible
is
zeal
without
true
knowledge
how
awful
bigotry
born
by
religion
how
black
is
priestcraft
bred
by
selfishness
before
whose
no
redress
for
any
sympathizer
with
rebellion
against
the
schemes
of
jesuitic
college
his
aroused
such
thought
he
paused
and
crossed
himself
perhaps
he
sinned
in
thinking
thus
and
carried
thus
away
by
that
sad
spectacle
and
then
did
say
within
himself
be
the
fellow
grinned
because
his
faith
a
glory
to
him
that
the
motive
which
led
him
to
suffer
then
was
he
despicable
more
than
they
who
brazed
themselves
his
dirty
flesh
to
fry
then
was
his
smoke
a
stench
beneath
the
sky
his
ashes
unfit
for
his
clay
he
not
a
martyr
but
a
worthless
pride
quite
obstinate
of
fancied
light
diviner
truer
than
of
mother
church
did
actuate
the
protestants
to
die
then
there
is
justice
in
the
cry
for
such
an
arrogance
the
truth
will
smirch
and
rob
its
scepter
of
celestial
thus
did
philosopher
and
churchman
speak
and
now
the
poet
whispered
be
still
where
are
thy
chimes
all
england
needs
their
tone
of
harmony
to
make
the
people
one
thy
golden
chimes
at
last
their
music
will
interpret
all
which
men
through
xxi
pained
and
disgusted
with
the
sight
he
passed
out
of
the
city
not
very
far
before
he
struck
the
open
which
led
to
shoreditch
church
and
meadows
broad
and
fields
of
golden
grain
where
nought
did
mar
the
peace
of
all
that
was
with
nature
classed
amid
a
field
below
a
slope
he
saw
a
man
at
work
also
a
lad
with
sickles
in
their
hands
grain
he
stopped
and
looked
at
them
the
boy
with
pain
seemed
raise
himself
when
he
a
bundle
had
completed
trying
with
his
sire
to
cope
and
while
he
stretched
his
aching
weary
back
he
gazed
across
the
field
with
longing
look
how
many
days
take
to
reach
the
end
the
dividing
stake
then
spit
into
his
hands
and
firmly
took
his
place
behind
his
cleancut
track
this
incident
sordino
much
impressed
he
read
at
once
the
feelings
of
the
boy
that
not
alone
in
body
but
in
mind
he
suffered
sought
deliverance
to
find
and
so
he
said
will
the
lad
employ
i
need
a
guide
whom
with
dreams
hath
the
father
would
not
listen
to
sordino
whose
english
he
but
scarcely
understood
and
half
afraid
of
this
so
swarthy
stranger
in
times
like
those
so
full
of
lurking
danger
but
when
he
saw
his
gold
it
seemed
quite
good
and
gave
consent
to
let
his
helper
go
but
not
before
his
mother
had
been
seen
her
sanction
gained
for
what
he
felt
some
fears
and
so
they
left
the
sheaves
of
ripened
wheat
and
sought
their
humble
blithe
retreat
a
little
cottage
thatched
and
gray
with
years
amid
the
trees
and
still
green
and
here
they
tarried
till
the
close
of
day
till
proclaimed
its
toil
should
cease
yea
tarried
over
night
for
heart
is
more
reluctant
with
the
child
to
part
but
in
the
morn
she
said
as
ye
please
and
gave
her
blessing
and
they
went
away
and
as
they
left
the
peals
from
shoreditch
came
on
the
crispéd
morning
air
like
streams
of
living
water
from
the
holy
mount
where
priests
with
silver
basins
at
its
fount
oblation
brought
to
golden
cherubims
amid
rejoicing
of
the
festive
hour
their
cleansing
tones
refreshing
to
the
mind
and
nature
smiling
drank
their
harmony
the
crystal
dew
vibrating
with
delight
a
veil
of
mist
the
garment
of
the
night
hung
the
deepest
valley
seemed
to
flee
before
their
dancing
with
a
timid
wind
sordino
felt
their
rapture
like
a
flow
of
scented
warmth
which
crept
through
limbs
and
brain
and
to
his
heart
where
it
stayed
until
each
chilling
sorrow
was
allayed
and
joy
of
other
years
returned
again
enkindling
in
his
face
a
new
glow
the
silent
lad
who
followed
him
had
often
heard
this
gladsome
melody
it
was
a
part
of
him
from
infancy
it
cast
upon
his
soul
a
witchery
from
which
no
mood
or
attitude
was
free
and
claimed
him
for
a
realm
remote
and
dim
it
was
the
springtime
of
the
golden
age
of
minstrelsy
and
here
and
there
a
youth
did
feel
its
the
flowers
and
saw
sweet
flitting
forms
amongst
the
bowers
and
heard
transporting
voices
in
the
air
which
captured
him
and
did
his
life
engage
and
though
perhaps
he
never
won
a
name
and
though
it
spoiled
his
life
for
things
and
fate
endowed
him
as
she
did
a
greene
with
wretched
penury
and
squalor
mean
still
he
who
sees
and
hears
and
gladly
sings
hath
recompense
transcending
gold
and
fame
woe
unto
him
around
whose
cradle
danced
the
fairies
on
the
golden
morning
ray
anointing
him
with
essence
of
the
rose
into
whose
soul
the
magic
music
flows
to
shape
itself
into
a
deathless
lay
who
all
denies
by
earthliness
entranced
to
him
no
smiling
faces
shall
appear
when
comes
the
eve
of
life
with
lowering
sky
but
voices
chiding
him
with
cowardice
because
he
chose
the
lucre
and
the
ease
and
did
his
calling
wilfully
deny
to
him

here
that
from
the
church
and
nature
rose
the
english
stage
when
he
the
should
write
the
drama
of
humanity
the
greatest
poet
of
all
history
who
mingled
laughter
with
the
deepest
gloom
music
with
its
sterner
prose
the
modern
drama
modern
ishmael
begotten
of
religion
like
a
youth
fair
and
slender
innocent
with
dancing
measures
upon
pleasure
bent
then
cast
away
by
of
the
truth
and
homeless
nourished
at
the
secret
well
and
when
his
great
emancipator
came
he
dared
to
dance
and
frisk
on
country
lanes
but
not
in
london
town
his
there
until
the
king
of
poesy
laid
bare
his
ancient
birthright
lost
grecian
manes
then
waxed
he
strong
and
daily
gained
in
fame
and
found
a
home
within
the
city
wall
where
still
he
dwells
and
ever
will
abide
in
his
duplicity
since
life
is
very
double
crying
at
its
fleeting
bubble
appearing
on
the
restless
in
morning
splendor
or
dusk
still
ishmael
to
first
begotten
still
preached
against
by
best
elect
and
he
returns
at
times
with
taunts
and
gibes
but
if
they
put
away
some
modern
scribes
and
did
great
drama
resurrect
our
modern
stage
would
not
be
half
as
rotten
regenerated
cleansed
what
ally
this
to
all
true
and
noble
under
heaven
a
mirror
of
ourselves
much
more

ideal
and
its
highest
mission

though
the
weary
heart
must
mirth
be

of
clear
gleam

the
true
born
help
the
quondam
alien
they
need
each
other
in
their
common
quest
for
happiness
the
pot
of
gold

let
the
secret
of
the
quest
be
told
by
each
in

do
his

to

into

they
walked
and
to
the

he
had
rented

an
hospitable
inn
by
no

small
of
quaint
designs
by
some
tall
outspreading
elm
trees
in
whose
pleasant
glooms
the
thievish
rooks
to
one
another
talked
and
there
were
gardens
in

where
fruit
of
cherries
and
of

were
sweetly

from
journeys
which
accounted

vain

would
his
simple
engage

spying

in
the
work

for
such
a
boy
he
easily
could
train
he
had
an
honest
heart
and
ready
mind
this
tavern
was
however
seldom
quiet
but
oft
for
merry
souls
a
rendezvous
for
wits
and
poets
chiefly
for
the
latter
to
whom
the
outside
of
the
social
platter
was
less
important
than
the
inside
true
whose
highest
law
was
their
own
fiat
when
god
makes
poets
misunderstood
the
mixture
is
too
much
for
common
folk
the
blending
of
all
things
in
earth
and
heaven
of
light
and
darkness
unto
them
is
given
an
angel
and
a
fiend
in
common
yoke
the
great
extremes
of
evil
and
of
good
as
in
morn
the
light
from
darkness
sprang
and
cosmic
beauty
out
of
chaos
rose
thus
out
of
reeking
stews
and
taverns
came
a
strong
illuminating
flame
and
stars
of
magnitudes
did
follow

the
morning

rapt
together

the
sights

london
were
but

the
ceaseless

it
is
left
to
wisdom
yet
to
say
if
things
are
worse
or
better
among
men
the
knew
greater
anguish
in
those
days
the
bridge
gave
terror
with
its
ghastliness
of
hoary
heads
uplifted
high
on
spits
the
palaces
had
dungeons
of
heartless
cruelties
and
grim
distress
and
halls
of
splendor
had
dark
hidden
ways
but
there
was
sunlight
on
the
crimson
tile
and
there
was
blueness
in
the
open
sky
and
breezes
bore
the
scent
of
rose
and
thyme
as
in
the
morn
they
met
chime
no
cloud
of
smoke
as
now
oppressed
the
eye
and
made
the
gentle
breath
of
heaven
vile
and
men
were
frank
and
honest
with
their
friends
and
also
frank
and
honest
with
their
foes
and
either
loved
with
nakedness
of
soul
or
fought
until
one
of
the
two
did
fall
strong
was
the
love
and
hard
the
blows
while
now
his
love
and
hate
man
subtly
blends
sordino
loitered
much
in
lane
and
street
and
listened
well
to
every
swinging
bell
and
searched
the
city
for
his
treasure
lost
but
not
a
sound
was
from
a
steeple
tost
of
its
his
ear
to
tell
nor
did
a
single
clue
his
vision
meet
he
daily
searched
until
the
winter
fog
began
to
close
about
the
sightly
town
then
melancholy
claimed
him
for
her
own
and
lest
he
should
be
lost
in
grief
and
groan
he
sought
the
company
of
those
who
drown
the
sorrows
of
their
hearts
with
ale
and
grog
xxv
once
poets
tuned
their
lyres
in
praise
of
bacchus
forsooth
he
was
a
god
all
garlanded
with
leaves
of
blooming
vine
adored
by
aphrodite
and
the
nine
bacchant
and
satyr
at
his
worship
trod
fantastic
measures
such
as
now
would
wrack
us
bards
have
turned
preachers
which
is
for
the
better
and
no
more
should
their
songs
extol
his
name
but
rather
sound
the
anguish
and
the
woe
brought
upon
man
by
this
relentless
foe
take
up
the
note
of
poverty
and
shame
and
ills
of
drunkenness
which
man
enfetter
until
his
in
human
nature
seated
as
on
a
throne
shall
no
more
have
its
sway
when
man
shall
cease
forgetfulness
to
borrow
of
failures
disappointments
and
dark
sorrow
from
his
delusions
which
no
ills
allay
until
until
his
reign
shall
be
defeated
but
judge
not
harshly
those
who
suffer
most
the
victims
of
the
cup
the
who
fight
a
hopeless
battle
and
go
down
show
love
and
pity
rather
than
a
frown
for
though
the
sot
by
men
may
be
contemned
still
there
is
one
who
came
to
save
the
lost
we
know
but
little
why
he
gave
himself
an
abject
slave
to
appetite
and
lust
what
passions
of
past
generations
found
in
him
their
culmination
held
him
bound
and
though
he
struggled
hard
it
seems
he
must
into
the
depths
of
sin
and
darkness
delv
perchance
ambition
was
his
waterloo
and
having
lost
the
last
and
strongest
trench
he
spends
a
starless
night
mid
weeping
gloom
abandoning
dreams
to
their
dark
tomb
he
seeks
at
last
his
remorse
to
quench
with
what
he
knows
his
manhood
will
undo
perhaps
the
fire
of
love
has
been
extinguished
and
left
but
cooling
ashes
on
the
hearth
and
one
whose
face
was
radiant
with
light
moves
him
like
a
shadow
of
the
night
and
since
his
life
has
lost
its
highest
worth
he
turns
to
rum
and
soon
is
all
relinquished
xxvi
when
men
are
drunk
they
often
babble
things
they
scarce
would
whisper
to
a
but
when
the
wine
has
loosened
sense
and
tongue
the
hidden
secret
to
the
crowd
is
flung
and
with
an
oath
its
owner
will
defend
a
truth
exaggerated
till
the
ring
of
brawlers
doth
declare
it
is
a
lie
for
which
he
ought
to
buy
a
round
of
drinks
thus
in
that
tavern
on
a
foggy
night
a
group
was
sitting
in
the
around
a
table
drinking
till
their
blinks
did
tell
that
reason
was
about
to
fly
and
one
a
bearded
sailor
began
to
tell
of
escapades
at
sea
of
war
in
foreign
lands
of
victory
in
such
a
loud
and
boasting
way
that
three
out
of
the
five
did
laugh
derisively
and
said
he
was
a
tailor
at
which
he
swore
and
drained
his
tankard
dry
and
called
them
all
a
motley
and
rose
to
go
but
then
his
friends
cried
must
not
leave
us
yet
for
dontcher
know
the
best
is
coming
say
how
did
ye
hang
those
tinklers
in
the
have
a
rye
sordino
being
witness
to
this
scene
approached
the
table
and
said
allow
me
to
provide
a
drink
for
all
a
sentence
which
upon
their
ears
did
fall
with
some
surprise
since
he
a
stranger
then
a
grin
of
acceptation
in
their
mien
and
he
sat
down
with
them
and
freely
drank
and
paid
for
all
the
drinks
the
barmaid
poured
thus
made
them
almost
feel
he
was
their
host
and
when
he
ordered
for
their
midnight
lunch
a
roast
they
sang
his
praise
the
grizzly
sailor
roared
fellow
have
you
robbed
the
venice
bank
they
revelled
and
caroused
and
stories
told
the
most
of
which
were
and
smutty
the
sailor
being
richest
in
his
stores
of
drunken
bouts
and
fights
on
foreign
shores
but
as
the
chemist
in
the
finds
tutty
thus
sought
sordino
in
this
slag
the
gold
for
he
had
thought
at
first
to
see
a
glint
of
something
in
the
and
the
tower
and
now
he
tried
to
draw
the
sailor
out
on
this
allusion
in
his
flout
an
hesitation
and
a
lower
and
then
the
old
tar
understood
the
hint
tinklers
aye
ha
ha
those
merry
bells
we
carried
up
from
france
to
limerick
and
nearly
lost
in
a
confounded
gale
aye
aye
old
top
by
these
there
hangs
a
tale
i
heard
from
one
who
wounded
lay
and
sick
a
soldier
who
had
seen
a
hundred
bells
were
taken
in
a
bloody
war
sir
what
is
that
to
thee
another
drink
sordino
forced
a
laugh
and
ordered
wine
a
bottle
of
old
port
none
did
decline
but
drank
until
the
weak
began
to
wink
and
silence
made
encroachment
round
the
bar
the
sailor
bibbed
the
longest
ate
his
roast
and
told
sordino
how
the
bells
were
sold
to
a
great
churchman
in
the
irish
isle
that
they
are
ringing
daily
from
a
pile
most
venerable
whence
no
price
of
gold
can
return
them
to
their
native
coast
sordino
knew
they
were
his
own
and
smiled
to
learn
the
place
where
strangely
they
had
landed
and
when
the
sailor
swore
it
all
was
true
sordino
from
the
company
withdrew
but
not
before
it
was
of
him
demanded
that
what
he
heard
for
ever
must
be
xxvii
sordino
looking
for
his
boy
that
night
found
him
departed
whither
none
could
tell
they
sought
him
in
the
tavern
and
the
street
but
all
in
vain
the
watchman
on
his
beat
was
queried
as
he
passed
and
cried
well
and
laughingly
replied
out
of
sight
the
boy
had
weary
grown
and
sick
for
home
when
he
his
master
saw
with
drunkards
douce
and
dared
the
denseness
of
the
fog
to
find
that
place
which
daily
occupied
his
mind
the
little
cottage
the
trees
recluse
seemed
grander
than
the
pillard
dome
a
dog
might
find
its
way
but
not
a
child
through
such
a
maze
bewildering
and
weird
he
thought
he
surely
knew
the
homeward
road
and
eagerly
for
hours
he
onward
strode
but
only
to
discover
what
he
feared
he
was
as
lost
as
a
forest
wild
the
thames
was
like
a
spectral
realm
of
sound
and
shapes
the
masts
of
many
ships
at
tow
were
dimly
visible
and
larger
seemed
like
mighty
giants
as
the
moonlight
beamed
into
the
woolly
fog
the
sounds
below
the
song
and
baying
of
a
hound
all
else
was
silent
till
a
sailor
coughed
and
damned
the
dog
which
thus
disturbed
his
sleep
and
now
the
lad
called
out
in
fear
lost
oh
help
me
is
near
to
which
a
voice
arose
as
from
the
deep
is
a
lubber
straying
from
his
but
then
ere
long
there
was
a
splash
of
oar
and
muffled
talking
twixt
two
drowsy
tars
the
boy
took
heart
since
rescue
was
at
hand
but
when
he
found
himself
pushed
out
from
land
and
lifted
to
a
deck
of
lofty
spars
he
kind
of
wished
himself
back
to
the
shore
the
sailors
showed
him
to
a
bunk
for
rest
in
the
morn
the
fog
may
lifted
be
so
you
can
find
your
way
thus
cheered
they
him
but
as
of
old
the
halfbaked
ephraim
howled
on
his
bed
so
would
now
even
he
had
not
submission
been
for
him
the
best
xxviii
the
fog
grew
lighter
with
the
dawn
of
day
as
did
the
heart
after
night
of
weeping
he
early
and
would
have
left
the
ship
but
since
for
boatswain
he
possessed
no
tip
he
dared
not
rouse
him
from
his
pleasant
sleeping
and
distance
from
the
shore
compelled
his
stay
at
last
both
crew
and
passengers
awoke
and
all
gazed
at
the
lad
some
with
a
smile
when
of
his
rescue
told
some
poked
their
fun
but
the
passengers
his
eye
met
one
who
read
the
trouble
of
a
homesick
child
and
in
strange
accents
kindly
to
him
spoke
she
seemed
to
him
the
fairest
he
had
seen
a
spirit
from
the
mist
emerged
a
gleam
of
light
strayed
from
the
hidden
sun
enlivening
the
sodden
scene
and
dun
a
venus
from
the
foam
where
billows
surged
born
to
be
worshiped
or
to
be
a
queen
but
what
she
said
to
him
was
quite
egyptian
it
mattered
not
since
he
could
understand
the
sympathy
and
goodness
of
her
heart
a
thing
much
better
than
linguistic
art
in
any
woman
yea
in
any
man
though
speech
is
fine
the
deed
is
much
more
christian
she
gave
him
food
and
wine
and
cheered
his
soul
then
left
him
to
himself
an
hour
or
so
when
came
the
captain
and
thus
to
him
spake
thou
a
stranger
here
or
canst
thou
make
thy
way
alone
and
knowest
where
to
go
when
lifted
is
the
distressing
pall
to
which
the
lad
replied
know
the
town
when
i
can
see
its
street
and
thoroughfare
and
now
can
find
my
way
up
to
the
inn
where
dwells
my
master
oh
it
was
a
sin
that
i
deserted
him
since
he
may
care
i
will
return
to
him
please
let
me
down
to
which
the
captain
said
have
on
board
two
passengers
who
wish
an
inn
to
find
and
canst
thou
guide
them
to
such
place
my
son
that
lovely
lady
whom
you
met
is
one
the
other
is
her
father
noble
kind
a
foreign
scholar
and
methinks
a
the
boy
responded
readily
to
this
as
drew
on
clear
became
their
guide
up
to
that
quite
pretentious
hostelry
half
glad
half
his
master
there
to
see
but
ignorant
how
fate
strode
by
his
side
and
how
it
seldom
seems
to
go
amiss
xxix
that
afternoon
sordino
sought
his
place
among
the
a
rustic
seat
which
during
gloomy
days
had
stood
alone
but
now
again
the
sun
so
brightly
shone
inviting
him
to
this
retreat
though
it
had
lost
the
tender
grace
and
whom
should
here
his
pensive
eyes
behold
but
one
of
whom
he
at
that
moment
thought
and
as
he
met
her
quite
astonished
gaze
surprise
brought
strong
emotions
to
his
face
he
knew
not
what
strange
magic
this
had
wrought
his
heart
beat
fast
his
hands
grew
clammy
cold
she
smiled
and
greeted
him
in
his
own
tongue
then
wist
he
that
it
was
no
mere
illusion
but
stella
yea
the
stella
of
his
dreams
so
strange
so
sweetly
strange
it
ever
seems
to
lonely
lovers
such
a
rapt
confusion
when
that
which
separates
aside
is
flung
and
yet
it
did
not
give
to
him
the
joy
of
one
who
knows
why
his
beloved
came
he
wondered
much
but
did
not
dare
to
ask
his
became
a
subtle
mask
which
hid
the
raging
of
the
inward
flame
that
might
again
a
newborn
hope
destroy
a
eye
can
look
through
feint
behind
his
mask
she
sees
the
naked
soul
and
laughs
with
mingled
sympathy
and
scorn
she
suffers
not
because
he
is
forlorn
and
rather
likes
to
see
him
prostrate
fall
before
her
feet
as
if
she
were
a
saint
and
stella
knew
it
racked
mind
why
she
was
there
but
only
this
she
told
father
and
myself
last
night
arrived
in
london
harbor
but
the
fog
contrived
to
keep
us
captives
in
the
hold
until
this
morn
when
we
this
place
did
found
ye
it
sordino
dared
to
question
lad
who
said
his
lodging
here
did
guide
us
and
methinks
i
see
him
sordino
turned
and
saw
the
despair
and
called
him
in
a
tone
that
felled
his
fear
he
came
and
was
without
confession
and
stella
took
his
hand
and
stroked
his
head
sordino
wishing
that
he
was
the
lad
he
found
a
coin
and
told
him
to
be
gone
and
like
the
earth
from
which
the
fog
was
blown
the
boy
felt
in
his
heart
relieved
and
glad
and
brushed
his
clothes
and
made
his
bed
alone
the
conversation
of
the
two
was
chiefly
about
trifles
and
the
weather
with
many
pauses
since
so
much
did
press
heart
so
much
he
would
confess
and
since
it
was
so
strange
to
be
together
with
her
whom
he
adored
yet
did
not
know
soon
stella
pleading
cold
arose
to
go
without
a
promise
of
another
meeting
sordino
feeling
chills
about
his
heart
and
as
they
from
the
garden
did
depart
that
little
hour
so
full
and
yet
so
fleeting
seemed
to
him
fatal
and
mal
á
propos
xxx
like
a
great
musician
whose
deft
fingers
control
the
hidden
of
he
plays
upon
the
soul
with
mastery
and
uses
all
the
stops
of
melody
of
deepest
sorrow
highest
ecstacies
of
stormy
fugues
or
tune
that
softly
lingers
thus
did
he
play
upon
heart
when
to
himself
he
suddenly
was
left
a
flood
of
passion
overwhelmed
his
soul
in
which
he
heard
himself
her
name
to
call
and
spent
did
leave
him
painfully
bereft
yea
caused
unmanly
bitter
tears
to
start
he
wiped
away
the
furtive
tear
and
went
into
the
where
he
called
for
wine
and
freely
drank
then
entering
the
street
the
sailor
of
last
night
he
chanced
to
meet
who
told
him
for
a
drink
he
sore
did
pine
and
had
alas
his
very
farthings
spent
sordino
handed
him
sufficient
coin
to
make
him
happy
for
another
night
he
thanked
him
most
profusely
and
betook
himself
into
the
pleasant
nook
where
he
did
find
his
supreme
delight
a
cup
of
sack
and
others
it
to
join
sordino
sauntered
carelessly
along
and
with
no
aim
but
to
assuage
his
mind
which
wandered
twixt
a
ray
of
hope
and
fear
when
all
at
once
he
saw
her
drawing
near
in
company
with
one
whose
eye
did
find
her
smile
surcharged
with
an
affection
strong
a
glance
told
of
his
manly
cast
and
tall
in
military
suit
but
with
a
face
so
much
unlike
her
mien
and
what
sordino
could
instantly
glean
it
had
a
strength
but
not
of
thought
and
truth
but
rather
courage
stemming
any
blast
correctly
he
surmised
this
very
man
was
fiancé
and
jealousy
that
monster
held
him
by
the
throat
or
as
in
modern
parlance
his
goat
a
phrase
suggestive
of
the
purity
of
english
even
among
a
college
clan
the
jealousy
of
outraged
marriage
bonds
real
or
imagined
as
oft
finds
expression
in
a
dark
revenge
the
faithless
spouse
is
treated
as
a
wench
the
vile
seducer
suffers
every
loss
unless
perchance
he
with
his
prize
absconds
with
hapless
suitors
has
she
gentler
ways
when
pledgeless
smiles
is
all
they
have
obtained
though
none
may
fully
know
what
she
may
do
for
even
of
such
full
many
ones
she
slew
but
in
this
case
sordino
deeply
pained
she
led
about
as
in
a
dreamy
haze
he
wandered
on
the
banks
of
wimpling
thames
and
on
the
anchored
ships
did
idly
stare
but
had
no
mind
for
all
the
life
and
mirth
beneath
the
languid
sails
upon
the
firth
since
nought
he
saw
but
that
one
happy
pair
and
but
two
eyes
more
glorious
than
gems
with
approach
his
feelings
took
the
hue
of
creeping
shadows
and
the
purple
dark
and
sadness
grew
to
an
oppressive
load
then
jealousy
to
anger
did
him
goad
and
to
its
fouler
plots
he
once
did
hark
which
with
a
frenzy
did
his
blood
imbue
then
came
the
music
of
bell
commingling
with
of
deeper
tongue
and
oped
his
prison
of
unhappiness
they
had
a
solace
that
could
calm
and
bless
and
when
the
last
vibrating
note
was
rung
he
homeward
turned
and
whispered
is
xxxi
as
a
philosopher
sordino
tried
to
make
himself
believe
that
all
was
well
something
opposed
his
wise
decree
he
sought
to
sup
but
found
each
dish
to
be
devoid
of
savor
both
in
taste
and
smell
his
spleen
the
philosophy
defied
he
sought
his
couch
and
courted
gentle
sleep
and
stoically
scorned
his
but
somnus
was
so
far
away
unheeding
and
thoughts
in
solitude
were
slowly
feeding
upon
his
heart
like
lions
in
their
lair
instead
of
rest
his
misery
grew
deep
the
clock
struck
ten
he
rose
and
left
his
room
the
bar
was
lively
and
he
chose
its
folly
there
was
the
sailor
garrulous
and
drunk
in
company
with
one
a
quondam
monk
from
reign
when
monks
unduly
jolly
were
driven
from
pretended
but
if
the
ruby
brightness
of
his
nose
was
then
acquired
or
in
his
homeless
state
is
not
for
me
to
say
but
it
surpassed
even
his
who
years
had
sailed
before
the
mast
and
with
the
aid
of
gin
and
stormy
fate
had
made
it
blossom
like
an
irish
rose
these
two
from
spheres
so
far
apart
had
met
across
a
stoop
of
ale
which
like
the
river
of
classic
eld
can
quench
all
mundane
sorrow
make
men
forgetful
of
the
past
and
morrow
upon
whose
bosom
dreams
all
sunlit
quiver
until
it
empties
in
a
sea
of
jet
upon
the
quick
discovery
of
count
presence
he
approached
him
with
a
courtsy
very
risible
and
whispered
that
he
had
something
to
tell
which
on
their
precious
secret
did
encroach
and
asked
him
come
aside
from
company
sordino
followed
with
a
sense
of
fear
that
it
was
money
which
the
rogue
was
after
and
cared
but
little
for
his
muddled
talk
soon
on
the
dark
deserted
they
stood
where
faint
the
hum
and
laughter
of
drinking
men
fell
on
the
listening
ear
in
broken
sentences
and
low
the
croon
confided
to
sordino
something
strange
he
had
that
very
eve
beheld
the
man
who
brought
the
bells
from
france
to
old
ireland
first
on
the
street
then
on
a
embracing
a
young
lady
the
moon
moreover
he
had
chanced
to
meet
a
fellow
who
used
to
wear
the
cowl
in
whilom
days
but
had
doffed
cloth
and
everything
religious
and
though
his
story
was
somewhat
ambiguous
he
claims
to
know
the
chimes
and
doth
much
praise
their
wondrous
tones
as
very
clear
and
mellow
this
tale
engrossed
mind
intensely
they
entered
sought
the
monk
who
half
asleep
sat
by
a
table
all
alone
the
two
aroused
him
with
a
drink
of
better
brew
now
with
the
sailor
he
the
best
did
reap
from
the
interest
and
liberality
sordino
made
agreement
with
these
men
to
go
with
him
to
ireland
even
that
week
which
they
did
promise
for
a
goodly
hire
for
both
declared
they
knew
the
very
spire
around
whose
golden
cross
his
chimes
did
seek
their
flight
up
to
the
choirs
of
heaven
xxxii
o
god
of
gold
whose
universal
sway
is
not
the
underworld
on
the
plutonic
shore
and
hideous
like
that
of
dream
but
on
our
face
bright
with
the
gleam
of
sun
thy
power
has
ever
more
commanded
human
nature
to
obey
thou
sittest
not
in
gloomy
woods
and
caves
a
loathsome
creature
with
the
hoarded
pelf
but
in
the
palace
and
the
mansion
bright
in
marble
temples
large
and
fair
bedight
a
princely
being
though
controlled
by
self
to
whom
most
men
submit
themselves
as
slaves
the
beautiful
the
learnéd
and
the
strong
are
vying
with
the
baser
mass
to
serve
thee
ardently
that
favor
they
may
find
they
offer
beauty
skill
of
hand
and
mind
and
ceaseless
toil
until
the
vital
nerve
of
life
is
gone
the
source
of
joy
and
song
some
barter
soul
and
body
for
the
gold
and
bear
but
semblance
to
the
freeborn
man
the
food
is
rich
the
wine
is
sparkling
red
what
matter
then
if
soul
and
heart
are
dead
but
in
the
darkness
stand
the
masses
wan
and
homeless
children
shiver
in
the
cold
thou
rulest
kings
and
statesmen
in
their
places
thou
makest
war
and
causest
it
to
cease
thou
art
the
supremest
autocrat
and
our
land
is
bending
on
the
mat
before
thy
terrible
increase
which
even
the
shallow
lawgiver
amazes
it
is
not
lavish
gifts
alone
that
bind
but
the
droppings
of
the
shining
ore
thus
here
the
tips
sordino
gave
the
salt
enthralled
him
to
a
virtue
or
a
fault
so
in
a
whisper
recklessly
he
swore
take
that
coward
and
knock
out
his
wind
just
then
foe
was
entering
the
with
a
smile
of
exultation
the
salt
arose
and
held
him
by
the
arm
the
soldier
looked
at
him
with
small
alarm
or
rather
with
a
frown
of
irritation
and
sought
the
drunken
sailor
from
him
fling
who
brawled
aloud
judas
who
would
again
for
thirty
shillings
sell
our
holy
son
look
on
my
face
as
one
who
helped
thee
in
thy
wicked
ways
to
make
a
fortune
on
a
stolen
bell
inscribed
with
glory
to
lord
zebaoth
knew
not
better
then
but
now
i
do
those
bells
we
freighted
were
but
stolen
good
and
thou
the
thief
enriched
by
robbing
god
thou
thinkest
all
are
resting
the
sod
who
knew
their
tale
but
by
the
holy
rood
there
is
one
yet
alive
make
thee
rue
at
which
the
soldier
grasped
his
sword
to
fight
the
sailor
laughed
thou
the
weaponless
he
fell
upon
the
floor
stabbed
in
the
breast
then
rose
sordino
and
to
all
confest
am
the
man
behind
this
sorry
mess
but
will
take
pains
to
settle
it
he
drew
his
sword
and
challenging
his
rival
they
bore
upon
each
other
with
a
fury
which
in
sordino
reached
a
double
strength
he
felt
that
fate
had
brought
him
this
at
length
not
even
the
archbishop
of
canterbury
could
stop
him
now
from
being
the
survival
the
parries
of
the
combatants
revealed
their
mastery
in
fencing
and
it
seemed
a
doubtful
issue
who
should
win
the
fray
when
suddenly
besides
the
sailor
lay
the
soldier
with
a
gash
from
which
there
streamed
a
flood
of
life
the
young
doom
was
sealed
that
night
the
sailor
and
the
soldier
perished
sordino
and
his
page
set
out
on
flight
but
stella
and
her
father
mourned
the
loss
of
one
whom
they
thought
gold
but
was
mere
dross
a
with
no
sense
of
right
who
nought
but
selfish
aims
had
ever
cherished
a
double

may
win
the
noblest
heart
by
hiding
foulness
neath
pretended
good
until
the
reveals
the
truth
and
to
the
innocent
the
crushing
ruth
when
he
that
trusted
was

understood
and
all
dissemblings
from
his
life
depart
xxxiii
the
foot
is
fleet
when
conscience
spurs
it
on

to

more
than

the

should
preparation
make

with

from
its
sacred
lore
the
true
inflection
xxxiv
with
first
grey
dawn
of
day
the
hermit
rose
to
pray
as
was
his
custom
every
morn
and
with
him
knelt
sordino
in
contrition
for
through
the
hours
of
night
the
awful
vision
of
wanton
murder
to
his
mind
was
borne
and
robbed
him
of
all
rest
and
and
to
the
holy
man
he
did
confess
and
begged
his
absolution
which
was
granted
but
still
the
deed
so
weighed
upon
his
heart
that
when
his
two
companions
did
depart
he
fain
would
have
his
own
chanted
to
make
an
end
of
harrowing
distress
such
is
the
soul
that
once
attuned
to
peace
must
pass
through
vale
of
dark
remorse
in
whom
the
joy
of
and
grief
of
hell
are
seeking
one
another
to
expel
well
then
if
the
afflicted
take
recourse
to
him
who
calms
the
storm
and
gives
surcease
the
ruing
of
our
sins
the
repentance
the
coming
to
oneself
and
meeting
god
is
after
all
the
only
way
to
rest
all
else
is
but
a
vain
and
foolish
quest
a
hiding
from
the
terror
of
his
rod
a
quailing
for
a
righteous
sentence
for
it
is
then
and
only
then
the
father
can
meet
his
child
such
as
it
left
his
home
bestow
the
kiss
of
pardon
and
the
love
of
ring
and
raiment
from
his
treasure
trove
and
bid
him
to
the
palace
with
him
come
there
with
the
tranquil
spirits
ever
gather
sordino
now
like
israel
of
old
passed
through
the
inner
struggle
with
the
lord
until
the
morning
of
his
soul
appeared
and
with
the
light
of
victory
him
cheered
the
brook
of
bitter
weeping
he
did
ford
and
found
beyond
the
comfort
of
fold
xxxv
deem
it
not
strange
that
men
of
deeper
thought
retired
to
solitudes
of
woods
and
mountains
where
by
a
life
of
and
contemplation
they
strove
to
find
the
complete
salvation
and
drink
of
unpolluted
fountains
and
comprehend
what
god
for
man
hath
wrought
the
solitude
in
which
the
hermit
dwelt
was
deep
and
undisturbed
by
human
strife
no
sound
was
heard
but
matchless
tones
its
song
the
cry
the
sigh
the
wandering
moans
which
lift
the
vision
to
a
life
that
has
no
language
but
alone
is
felt
such
quiet
is
a
balm
for
wretched
minds
a
cooling
water
to
the
soul
athirst
sordino
drank
it
like
the
cup
of
grace
in
which
you
see
the
crownèd
face
god
spoke
to
him
not
as
to
cain
accurst
but
as
a
father
in
the
whispering
winds
xxxvi
towards
eve
that
day
arrived
his
faithful
aid
who
after
stealthy
search
had
found
a
ship
for
ireland
bound
to
sail
that
very
night
and
in
the
dark
before
the
moon
rose
bright
they
might
into
its
hiding
safely
slip
the
captain
willing
to
be
doubly
paid
so
as
the
dusk
grew
on
the
kindly
dusk
which
like
a
weeping
love
embraces
her
guilty
child
to
pardon
shield
and
hide
close
to
her
breast
where
nothing
shall
betide
him
but
the
shelter
from
the
cruel
faces
of
an
avenging
world
he
rose
to
busk
with
his
companions
yet
ere
he
took
leave
he
prayed
the
blessing
on
his
soul
then
put
a
golden
pound
within
his
palms
the
hermit
thanked
him
for
his
alms
then
blessed
him
with
the
cross
yea
blessed
them
all
and
bid
them
fare
in
hope
and
not
to
grieve
then
they
departed
to
a
little
boat
hid
in
a
wooded
nook
upon
the
river
and
in
the
darkness
for
the
ship
set
out
and
quinn
who
plied
the
oars
did
make
the
route
without
a
blunder
to
the
as
proud
a
galleon
as
was
afloat
xxxvii
when
man
has
lost
the
moorings
of
his
home
and
on
the
sea
of
life
is
tossed
about
bereft
of
anchorage
of
heart
nor
wife
nor
child
have
in
his
life
a
part
then
cares
he
little
for
the
farewell
shout
and
sometimes
little
whither
he
may
roam
not
so
with
children
when
the
in
the
cerulean
like
sends
forth
its
heavenly
gleam
of
love
and
peace
the
longing
for
the
home
doth
then
increase
and
from
the
soul
goes
up
a
bitter
cry
to
be
with
those
so
dear
but
so
afar
page
stood
at
the
railing
as
the
ship
bore
down
the
thames
that
night
and
none
did
mark
the
tears
that
trickled
fast
and
none
did
see
the
glances
which
he
cast
towards
the
home
which
was
his
delight
while
farther
farther
from
it
he
did
pass
sordino
missed
him
sitting
in
the
hold
and
asked
his
friend
to
bring
him
down
and
as
he
came
and
stood
in
the
dim
glow
of
at
once
with
pain
he
saw
the
redness
of
his
eyes
so
large
and
brown
and
felt
his
hands
that
they
were
strangely
cold
and
he
did
put
his
arm
around
his
neck
and
lowly
spoke
with
tenderness
and
cheer
that
he
should
see
again
the
home
he
loved
and
him
with
goodly
promises
endowed
of
favors
that
would
make
each
coming
year
as
carefree
as
the
sailors
on
the
deck
xxxviii
the
sea
attracts
the
soul
that
deeply
yearns
for
freedom
and
adventure
like
the
iron
which
is
by
magnet
drawn
and
so
it
be
that
the
cruder
natures
one
may
see
the
eye
of
masefield
or
a
byron
or
wit
and
humor
of
a
robert
burns
and
sailors
love
to
sing
or
tell
a
tale
songs
set
to
music
by
the
wave
and
wind
and
yarns
with
tang
and
laughter
of
the
deep
and
on
a
day
when
all
things
seem
asleep
in
golden
calm
you
best
may
find
the
squatting
crew
itself
of
these

such
a
day

sing
a
little
lay

a
dawn

on
raptured
wing
my
native

adieu
i
leave
thee
for
a
while
as
fade
thy
cliffs
amid
the
blue
and
trembling
of
thy
smile
i
sing
my
parting
song
with
tears
but
not
as
cravens

thy
love

out
the
fears

a
courage

in

with
the
glow
arising
from
the

with

as

to

spurned
the
danger

and

that
overwhelm
to
reach
that
land

none
returned
to

from
his
quest
unless
his

within

burned
with
thanks
for
what

xxxix
the
song
was
ended
and
the
applause
did
please
the
lad
who
sang
it
to
his
the
midshipman
then
essayed
to
relate
a
story
with
a
mystery
and
fate
of
queen
in
english
castle
and
a
brute
whom
she
did
love
her
absent
heartless
spouse
but
while
he
spake
the
captain
did
appear
unfinished
hung
the
story
on
the
lips
a
spaniard
would
not
let
such
story
pass
since
holy
was
his
monarch
though
an
ass
castilian
yea
to
the
who
for
his
god
and
king
had
equal
fear
but
all
his
crew
was
english
and
did
pity
though
not
from
love
their
queen
of
grief
and
rage
the
most
unfortunate
on
any
throne
who
languished
in
her
palace
sad
and
lone
a
zealot
for
her
faith
who
dared
to
wage
a
final
fight
for
the
eternal
city
her
love
for
philip
was
a
tragedy
of
whom
the
people
spake
and
lent
it
hue
of
fateful
romance
and
a
mystery
yea
in
the
night
strange
phantoms
men
did
see
of
things
the
superstitious
counted
true
but
round
it
all
clung
native
sympathy
the
captain
becked
sordino
to
his
side
and
spoke
in
accents
foreign
to
his
men
on
whom
a
silence
fell
deep
as
the
when
lo
there
rose
a
curling
little
breeze
and
then
another
stronger
than
its
friend
who
called
on
horses
for
a
ride
the
captain
bid
the
men
to
tend
the
sails
and
quickly
did
each
sailor
now
respond
the
sheets
were
spread
before
the
rising
wind
and
swiftly
did
they
leave
the
coast
behind
to
reach
the
vast
and
sunlit
mere
beyond
where
ocean
billows
surge
with
piercing
wails
xl
mind
sank
into
gloomy
night
as
time
grew
heavy
with
a
voyage
long
he
brooded
on
the
past
and
as
he
did
it
seemed
that
shadows
all
its
sunshine
hid
and
sickness
too
did
make
the
man
once
strong
feel
aged
worthless
and
in
awful
plight
the
story
by
the
midshipman
did
linger
upon
his
heart
increasing
awaking
sympathy
for
he
did
see
in
life
the
gathered
misery
of
many
storms
which
her
soul
did
strike
and
on
a
dark
and
hopeless
deep
did
bring
her
the
greatest
souls
must
bear
the
greatest
pain
and
sometimes
sweetness
turns
to
bitterness
and
they
who
for
the
heights
have
been
appointed
and
by
the
gods
or
fates
have
been
anointed
must
know
the
of
the
vintage
press
and
tread
it
all
alone
may
be
in
vain
thus
did
he
meditate
and
pleasure
found
in
philosophic
musings
day
by
day
but
this
was
unknown
to
the
hardy
crew
who
melancholy
with
their
laughter
slew
they
liked
him
not
and
wished
him
out
of
way
well
that
he
had
the
captain
to
him
bound
alas
to
him
the
chimes
of
life
were
lost
and
that
they
ever
rang
seemed
but
a
dream
the
elements
of
sea
and
air
enveloped
him
but
little
did
he
care
since
death
itself
a
friend
to
him
did
seem
of
all
things
weary
sick
and
but
in
such
hours
the
boy
drew
near
whom
he
did
love
a
light
shone
in
his
eyes
and
he
did
speak
to
him
so
tenderly
as
any
parent
which
did
set
him
free
from
painful
broodings
and
the
skies
and
mid
the
deepest
darkness
brought
him
cheer
xli
not
our
aim
to
tell
of
voyage
long
of
storms
and
struggles
on
the
wintry
seas
of
harbourage
and
waiting
in
its
course
mid
sheltered
inlets
upon
shores
though
full
of
hardship
yet
it
would
not
please
and
we
must
draw
to
close
our
lengthy
song
but
i
have
seen
full
many
a
ship
depart
receding
into
dimness
gray
and
cold
then
slip
away
lost
in
a
mighty
void
and
in
my
musings
i
have
tugged
and
toyed
with
memories
of
friends
or
what
they
told
in
words
that
strayed
from
an
unguarded
heart
for
are
sometimes
but
foolish
mumbling
and
arrogance
a
dark
conceit
while
silence
often
has
the
truest
depth
but
when
the
child
which
in
thy
bosom
slept
awakes
to
speak
a
morning
light
doth
greet
the
restless
in
his
painful
stumbling
for
there
are
seas
and
many
a
distant
shore
and
life
is
but
a
journey
and
a
fight
amid
the
mighty
elements
at
war
but
the
pilgrimage
is
and
when
the
peaceful
harbor
is
in
sight
word
alone
can
ope
the
xlii
upon
an
april
morn
the
ship
emerged
from
fitful
seas
into
the
placid
pool
of
limerick
the
day
was
clear
and
calm
and
nature
drew
the
breath
of
spring
its
balm
was
tempering
the
breezes
somewhat
cool
from
western
realms
where
surged
the
woods
and
lanes
stood
draped
in
flimsy
veil
of
hues
most
delicate
a
purple
shade
uniting
with
a
tender
touch
of
green
while
here
and
there
a
golden
glint
was
seen
of
upon
the
sloping
glade
or
round
the
ponds
where
fleecy
clouds
did
sail
the
skylark
lavishing
its
melody
upon
the
freedom
of
the
airy
height
did
carol
from
the
lofty
blue
so
long
that
not
of
earth
but
heaven
seemed
its
song
an
ariel
amid
the
dazzling
light
who
thrilled
the
heart
of
man
with
ecstasy
sordino
harkened
to
this
happy
flood
of
music
and
he
saw
his
servant
boy
gaze
upward
like
the
holy
men
that
day
when
christ
ascended
for
it
did
allay
his
sorrows
and
like
theirs
restore
his
joy
since
skylark
song
is
in
the
english
blood
for
have
not
wordsworth
and
great
shelley
proven
that
none
it
stirs
just
like
the
british
heart
to
whom
the
lark
gave
immortality
when
it
inspired
them
with
its
poesy
and
made
their
odes
the
acme
of
their
art
creations
from
texture
woven
mind
however
at
that
hour
lacked
the
repose
which
was
on
land
and
sea
and
without
mood
no
music
doth
arrest
for
by
an
eagerness
he
was
possest
to
know
in
truth
if
this
the
shore
might
be
which
held
his
treasure
in
cathedral
tower
the
fire
of
his
italian
blood
awoke
though
he
had
aged
so
much
upon
this
journey
he
longed
to
leave
the
ship
and
pass
along
the
river
which
was
famous
made
in
song
by
the
immortal
moore
and
quaint
mahoney
whose
remain
a
wish
to
be
the
first
to
land
was
granted
and
a
boat
placed
to
his
service
manned
by
two
sailors
and
the
monk
and
page
the
former
only
did
the
oars
engage
sordino
in
the
stern
sat
like
a
dervise
in
musings
deep
with
head
posed
on
his
hand
no
finer
vista
could
itself
unfold
than
that
which
burst
upon
his
dreamy
eye
as
full
in
view
the
city
did
appear
a
sight
which
drew
from
weary
hearts
a
tear
a
city
glimmering
twixt
sea
and
sky
with
citadels
and
shrines
even
then
so
old
the
sailors
left
off
rowing
and
gave
way
to
dreaming
on
the
scene
until
a
spell
possest
them
all
and
silent
did
they
rest
upon
the
calm
translucent
breast
when
all
at
once
the
clear
tone
of
a
bell
came
floating
softly
the
tranquil
bay
and
then
a
hymn
of
praise
rose
up
to
heaven
from
bells
whose
tongues
had
notes
beyond
compare
chimes
when
on
his
ears
they
fell
he
knew
such
happiness
which
none
can
tell
and
angel
hands
to
paradise
did
bear
the
soul
who
for
true
harmony
had
striven
as
riveted
he
sat
with
empty
stare
even
when
the
soul
had
from
its
temple
fled
the
boy
did
note
it
first
and
gave
a
cry
it
was
to
him
as
if
his
sire
did
die
the
monk
did
say
a
prayer
the
dead
and
bid
the
sailors
to
the
city
fare
they
buried
him
within
the
hallowed
pale
of
the
cathedral
that
the
chimes
might
sound
their
daily
dirge
above
the
grave
who
for
their
music
life
and
fortune
gave
who
with
their
mystery
his
fate
had
bound
a
lonely
pilgrim
through
a
gloomy
vale
his
sacrifice
was
not
in
vain
and
not
amiss
his
oft
belittled
quest
his
mantle
fell
upon
the
lad
to
whom
his
substance
he
bequeathéd
had
a
singer
he
became
among
the
best
with
cadence
of
the
chimes
in
lyric
strain
and
through
his
faith
the
faithless
was
restored
the
quondam
monk
became
a
godly
priest
who
humbly
made
the
message
of
the
bells
a
life
of
peace
where
discord
often
dwells
to
tell
of
this
strange
man
he
never
ceast
since
he
his
name
and
memory
adored
and
on
the
danube
in
her
hall
sat
stella
sorrowing
her
youth
away
the
people
said
it
was
for
her
dead
lover
but
none
did
know
and
none
did
discover
the
secret
of
her
heart
until
one
day
her
father
heard
her
on
sordino
call
the
prophecy
amid
a
vale
in
norway
stands
a
church
an
ancient
building
on
historic
ground
its
massive
walls
are
white
like
snow
its
lofty
spire
seems
golden
in
the
sun
around
it
mighty
spread
their
boughs
and
throw
their
shadows
on
the
graves
and
crumbling
monuments
of
centuries
their
music
blending
with
the
cry
and
with
the
deep
pure
tones
of
bells
whose
sound
reecho
the
wooded
hills
and
dells
awaking
fancies
of
the
of
royal
bards
who
sang
before
their
king
that
early
morning
of
the
fatal
day
when
olaf
his
standard
of
the
cross
fought
pagan
armies
from
those
sloping
heights
and
lost
his
cause
the
altar
has
been
built
above
the
stone
he
leaned
against
while
flowed
his
precious
from
the
cruel
wounds
the
ground
was
consecrated
by
his
blood
and
when
the
people
understood
and
bowed
before
the
christ
whose
saint
they
slew
they
built
a
chapel
on
the
place
of
martyrdom
which
in
succeeding
ages
was
enlarged
until
a
worthy
monument
stood
forth
the
ravages
of
time
have
wrought
their
change
but
it
is
the
trysting
place
between
the
people
and
their
god
a
place
which
links
the
present
to
the
past
and
gates
to
history
on
parchment
dim
with
age
a
chronicle
two
cycles
old
was
found
within
a
chest
amid
the
in
the
vaults
below
the
church
which
learnèd
parsons
read
and
then
restored
it
to
its
for
some
strange
reason
then
the
narrow
door
was
closed
up
with
a
solid
masonry
but
on
the
lips
from
age
to
age
the
legend
of
that
chronicle
has
passed
and
i
relate
it
here
as
told
to
me
when
but
a
boy
by
my
great
one
day
the
legend
says
the
parish
priest
a
young
and
pious
man
came
to
the
church
to
read
the
mass
for
a
departed
friend
when
he
beheld
a
lonely
woman
stand
within
the
shadow
of
a
which
spread
its
crown
of
green
and
red
beside
the
gate
which
led
into
the
sacred
place
her
hair
was
black
as
night
her
eyes
a
deep
of
melancholy
mystery
and
dreams
her
chiselled
features
had
the
striking
charm
of
youthful
beauty
and
a
mind
mature
she
was
unlike
the
women
of
the
vale
a
stranger
whom
the
priest
had
never
met
and
he
espied
her
with
a
sense
of
fear
her
sable
garb
and
downcast
mien
betrayed
a
state
of
grief
wherefore
the
kindly
man
led
by
a
heartfelt
sympathy
did
ask
what
great
bereavement
weighed
upon
her
soul
to
which
she
answered
i
sorrow
not
for
any
one
within
this
hallowed
ground
nor
elsewhere
for
the
dead
but
for
this
church
i
grieve
when
i
behold
how
it
is
doomed
to
dire
here
she
paused
and
sighed
now
he
surmised
she
was
the
prophetess
the
sibyl
whose
renown
had
come
to
him
and
therefore
asked
that
she
would
further
tell
about
her
vision
of
the
things
to
be
see
two
saplings
of
the
mountain
ash
grow
up
one
on
each
side
of
this
thy
church
i
also
see
a
breach
made
in
the
wall
and
when
the
saplings
have
grown
up
to
meet
as
mighty
trees
above
the
and
when
the
rent
shall
grow
sufficient
wide
to
be
the
hiding
of
a
prayer
book
then
shall
the
church
sink
down
and
be
no
then
quote
the
priest
with
frown
upon
his
face
house
built
on
a
rock
can
never
what
is
built
on
sand
the
floods
destroy
the
sibyl
said
and
quickly
went
away
into
the
church
the
parson
passed
and
knelt
before
the
altar
in
an
earnest
prayer
that
god
would
have
great
mercy
on
the
soul
of
his
departed
friend
whose
earthly
life
had
been
cut
off
in
a
most
tragic
way
his
widow
now
bestowing
on
the
church
rich
offerings
atonements
for
his
deeds
of
sinfulness
outweighing
charity
and
while
he
prayed
he
seemed
to
hear
the
cry
and
groaning
of
the
soul
from
out
the
fire
of
purgatory
supplications
strong
ascended
to
the
of
god
from
humble
until
he
felt
the
soul
was
loosed
in
heaven
as
on
earth
departing
from
the
church
he
looked
about
for
that
strange
mournful
face
but
she
was
gone
then
came
a
thought
to
him
a
memory
of
something
which
the
baron
him
had
told
how
on
a
day
while
on
a
hunt
he
met
a
maiden
in
a
forest
glen
a
slender
girl
of
beauty
such
as
he
had
seldom
seen
of
oriental
cast
who
weeping
told
him
of
his
fate
most
dire
that
fire
should
him
consume
a
prophesy
so
terribly
fulfilled
and
now
perchance
the
very
same
had
prophesied
to
him
this
thought
possessed
his
mind
as
home
he
strode
with
dark
forbodings
of
impending
doom
it
was
a
sunday
in
the
month
of
june
a
morn
of
most
bewitching
the
air
was
charged
with
fragrance
of
the
trees
of
blooming
cherry
trees
and
birch
of
mountain
ash
and
balsam
trees
of
and
prickly
juniper
of
alder
trees
along
the
winding
brooks
of
mountain
forest
of
the
pungent
pine
of
thousand
flowers
in
the
meads
and
vales
an
odor
sweet
unknown
to
tropic
within
acre
stood
the
nodding
rose
in
checkered
sunlight
neath
the
cypress
tree
and
greeted
every
breeze
that
wandered
by
groups
of
the
peasant
folk
were
gathering
about
the
graves
in
silent
thoughtfulness
and
some
in
sorrow
round
the
recent
mounds
the
air
so
calm
and
mild
with
fragrance
filled
the
tolling
of
the
church
bells
deep
and
strong
made
this
a
day
of
sweet
solemnity
felt
by
the
aged
and
the
youth
alike
and
while
they
lingered
lo
the
sibyl
came
from
group
to
group
a
whisper
passed
with
awe
is
the
sibyl
slowly
gathering
about
her
fearing
what
she
might
pronounce
they
gazed
upon
her
pale
and
mournful
face
is
but
vanity
all
things
are
nought
all
flesh
is
grass
which
flourisheth
a
while
then
withers
dies
and
mingles
with
the
dust
like
leaves
upon
the
trees
which
now
are
green
and
full
of
juice
but
in
the
autumn
turn
all
sear
and
yellow
falling
to
the
ground
whirled
by
the
chilling
blast
into
a
heap
and
thus
must
ye
return
to
dust
some
day
and
all
your
work
must
perish
even
so
yea
even
the
church
must
perish
on
that
day
when
crowns
of
mountain
ash
trees
meet
above
the
chancel
roof
and
when
the
wall
receives
within
its
rent
a
common
prayer
book
then
shall
the
earth
engulf
it
and
the
pride
of
generations
perish
in
the
thus
spake
the
sibyl
and
the
fearful
crowd
displeasure
showed
by
mien
and
murmuring
one
much
perturbed
essayed
to
argue
thus
words
o
woman
are
but
idle
talk
this
church
built
on
such
firm
and
rocky
ground
can
never
sink
such
prophecy
is
vain
to
which
she
answered
with
a
sigh
subdued
told
you
only
what
heard
and
seen
in
truest
vision
of
the
things
to
these
words
were
uttered
as
the
last
bell
rang
its
summons
to
the
mass
obeyed
at
once
by
all
the
people
leaving
her
alone
and
while
they
prayed
she
found
a
within
the
cooling
shadow
of
the
church
and
listened
to
a
lark
that
soared
on
high
against
the
blue
of
and
to
the
chorus
the
sighing
trees
but
most
of
all
did
note
the
cry
that
melancholy
bird
of
occult
hue
as
in
a
trance
she
listened
to
them
all
to
thousand
voices
of
a
day
but
ere
the
mass
was
ended
rose
and
went
along
a
forest
path
her
solitary
way
then
after
many
years
upon
a
morn
in
early
autumn
when
the
aspen
trees
were
turning
golden
and
the
starlings
sang
in
darkling
flocks
from
meadows
shorn
and
sear
the
pastor
took
his
much
accustomed
walk
for
he
did
love
to
be
alone
and
muse
upon
the
wondrous
scenes
around
his
home
and
feel
great
sweet
and
changing
moods
although
the
years
had
turned
his
hair
to
grey
and
robbed
his
steps
of
elasticity
still
was
his
spirit
quite
susceptible
to
happiness
but
more
to
touch
and
on
a
day
like
this
with
feelings
mixed
the
sadness
of
the
dying
summer
won
and
thoughts
of
life
its
purpose
and
its
end
did
occupy
his
mind
as
he
did
meet
the
sibyl
by
a
certain
turn
of
road
for
twenty
years
he
had
not
seen
her
face
and
it
did
startle
him
to
meet
her
now
she
too
had
changed
and
silver
locks
adorned
her
noble
forehead
but
her
eyes
were
keen
and
piercing
even
as
in
days
of
youth
and
as
she
stopped
to
speak
with
him
he
felt
their
searching
glances
knew
his
very
soul
has
god
ordained
for
she
said
to
which
he
sadly
answered
thus
life
seems
but
a
transitory
dream
and
all
its
efforts
profitless
and
thou
art
dust
thy
prayer
shall
be
heard
she
said
and
passed
on
her
way
he
too
moved
on
while
pondering
her
words
the
dark
enigma
of
the
prophetess
the
prophecies
we
thus
have
heard
and
their
fulfilment
now
we
will
relate
which
have
their
place
in
ages
the
priest
as
well
as
prophetess
were
gone
and
so
were
generations
after
them
half
hidden
by
the
dread
oblivion
the
prophecy
forgotten
but
a
few
had
heard
it
as
an
old
tradition
vague
a
fable
only
to
which
none
gave
heed
though
twain
ash
saplings
grew
from
year
to
year
and
saw
at
least
two
generations
pass
before
their
branches
met
above
the
church
a
breach
also
was
creeping
from
the
ground
up
through
the
massive
masonry
increasing
with
the
changes
of
the
years
two
things
which
did
recall
the
lore
and
led
the
people
to
cut
down
the
trees
to
fill
the
rent
and
hide
it
from
view
again
they
felt
assured
that
all
was
well
but
from
the
roots
new
shoots
began
to
grow
and
unmolested
through
full
many
years
for
ages
had
the
river
sung
its
song
with
the
church
melody
may
be
it
was
the
charm
of
liquid
chimes
which
drew
the
river
closer
year
by
year
but
almost
imperceptibly
until
one
spring
it
overflowed
its
banks
and
in
a
rage
fed
by
the
did
wear
away
the
distance
from
the
church
and
forced
its
course
up
to
the
wall
a
gruesome
scene
it
wrought
as
days
went
by
the
coffins
in
the
graves
began
to
show
and
bones
in
sepulchres
of
old
decay
occasionally
came
a
musty
skull
down
the
maelstrom
of
the
flood
and
now
and
then
a
crash
and
splash
was
heard
when
some
tall
monument
did
tumble
down
its
name
and
praise
lost
in
the
seething
deep
for
nought
can
man
achieve
but
it
is
doomed
at
last
to
ruin
and
oblivion
and
mighty
trees
were
undermined
and
sank
with
loads
of
earth
their
branches
the
stream
like
outstreched
arms
imploring
for
help
the
people
also
lifted
hands
in
prayer
for
night
and
day
they
feared
the
dreadful
hour
when
as
it
seemed
the
church
must
be
destroyed
the
pastor
summoned
them
to
spend
a
day
in
penitence
and
supplication
true
they
came
from
far
and
near
both
old
and
young
yea
even
the
sick
and
crippled
folk
were
brought
that
all
might
help
to
lift
one
prayer
to
heaven
a
common
prayer
from
their
humble
hearts
through
him
who
knelt
upon
the
altar
stair
whose
voice
had
notes
of
anguish
for
his
church
with
tears
a
penitential
psalm
was
sung
on
bended
knee
and
when
again
they
rose
to
leave
the
place
they
passed
with
downcast
heads
out
through
the
chancel
door
beside
the
which
the
old
time
rent
was
plainly
visible
and
where
again
the
had
reached
above
the
roof
and
met
crown
with
fear
they
listened
to
the
roar
now
only
hundred
cubits
from
the
church
and
to
the
moaning
of
the
chilly
wind
which
bare
the
rainclouds
the
naked
fields
it
was
the
midnight
hour
and
densely
dark
in
torrents
fell
the
rain
the
thunder
rolled
and
lurid
lightning
gleamed
across
the
sky
its
light
revealing
misery
and
one
lone
woman
groping
the
graves
who
sought
the
church
that
she
too
there
might
pray
the
only
one
who
at
the
mass
had
absent
been
for
death
had
kept
her
home
her
husband
struggling
with
the
last
grim
foe
the
struggle
being
ended
she
desired
to
share
in
that
great
prayer
of
the
day
for
this
she
stemmed
the
terror
of
the
night
and
spectral
fear
of
sepulchres
and
shrine
she
found
the
door
unlocked
and
opened
it
she
entered
crossed
herself
and
sought
a
pew
and
fervently
mercy
did
implore
then
something
strange
did
happen
for
behold
the
church
became
with
dazzling
light
illumed
and
stranger
still
a
crowd
of
people
streamed
through
every
door
and
without
footfall
sound
a
congregation
not
of
mundane
mien
but
glorious
in
countenance
and
dress
whose
utter
silence
seemed
a
breath
of
praise
they
filled
the
seats
and
by
the
woman
sat
but
to
her
touch
they
were
as
empty
space
up
from
the
vaults
below
emerged
a
band
of
priests
arrayed
as
in
the
days
when
each
did
serve
before
the
altar
of
this
selfsame
church
all
knelt
but
one
ascended
to
the
host
an
aged
man
whose
picture
still
adorned
the
gallery
about
whose
name
there
clung
the
legend
of
the
prophecy
he
led
them
in
a
supplication
strong
both
for
the
living
and
the
many
dead
whose
ashes
were
imperiled
by
the
flood
and
that
kind
heaven
would
spare
the
sacred
shrine
now
kyrie
eleison
sang
the
flock
with
hands
outstretched
toward
burning
altar
lights
while
all
the
ministers
exclaimed
amen
the
woman
felt
such
wondrous
happiness
she
thought
that
she
had
died
and
gone
to
heaven
yea
all
at
once
she
felt
assured
of
this
for
now
she
saw
her
husband
and
near
him
two
little
ones
departed
years
ago
she
ran
with
joy
to
clasp
them
in
her
arms
but
they
did
vanish
from
her
fond
embrace
yea
all
did
vanish
even
the
heavenly
lights
and
she
stood
there
alone
in
darkness
gross
the
silence
too
was
gone
and
now
the
storm
which
raged
in
all
its
fury
took
its
place
a
distant
rumbling
noise
was
clearly
heard
and
then
a
the
church
did
tremble
in
its
very
depths
the
woman
thought
the
had
come
her
strength
did
fail
her
and
she
swooned
away
when
morning
the
appeared
there
was
no
cloud
to
hinder
its
approach
and
all
creation
hailed
its
harbinger
the
first
faint
blushes
of
the
snowcapped
peak
the
raindrops
on
the
grass
and
upon
trees
soon
glittered
like
innumerable
pearls
and
diamonds
on
the
bosom
of
the
earth
the
hidden
chorus
in
the
woods
began
its
songs
of
praise
for
the
returning
calm
in
every
home
the
frightened
people
and
hardly
dared
to
speak
what
most
they
feared
the
church
destroyed
and
timidly
the
first
came
to
behold
the
ruins
of
the
night
but
when
they
saw
the
church
still
standing
there
they
ran
to
tell
the
people
and
the
priest
who
came
with
joy
and
found
it
even
so
a
miracle
it
seemed
had
taken
place
the
raging
flood
had
wholly
disappeared
its
empty
channel
bearing
witness
to
how
great
and
terrible
had
been
its
a
mighty
landslide
from
the
mountain
side
had
changed
its
course
back
to
an
ancient
bed
and
what
the
people
thought
the
dreadful
noise
of
their
beloved
fall
was
of
the
rushing
rumbling
earthen
slide
how
great
was
now
their
joy
when
they
perceived
that
god
had
heard
their
prayer
and
spared
his
house
with
praise
the
priest
across
the
threshold
stepped
and
many
followed
gladly
after
him
to
join
in
common
heartfelt
gratitude
but
suddenly
an
unexpected
scene
possessed
their
souls
and
filled
them
with
alarm
before
the
altar
steps
a
woman
lay
stark
dead
it
seemed
for
cold
and
pale
was
she
and
for
a
moment
all
did
hesitate
to
touch
her
thinking
she
was
surely
dead
a
moment
only
this
for
soon
the
priest
had
ascertained
that
life
was
not
extinct
and
helped
to
resuscitate
now
slowly
she
emerged
from
deadly
swoon
and
gaining
consciousness
at
last
could
tell
why
she
had
come
to
be
in
such
a
place
and
all
the
things
which
she
had
heard
and
seen
of
phantom
congregation
and
its
mass
of
priests
in
strange
array
before
the
host
they
marvelled
greatly
at
her
narrative
when
said
the
pastor
believe
forsooth
the
spirits
of
the
dead
have
worshiped
here
joined
in
the
prayers
of
their
living
friends
and
now
a
legend
the
name
of
him
whose
picture
you
have
pointed
out
comes
to
my
mind
the
prophecy
thou
art
dead
thy
prayer
shall
be
elegiacs
in
memoriam
judge
gorham
powers
died
april
i
the
flowers
lie
faded
on
his
mound
the
rose
and
lily
are
decayed
the
words
of
praise
we
said
did
vanish
almost
with
their
sound
the
throng
that
stood
around
his
bier
is
scattered
in
accustomed
ways
and
now
and
then
a
neighbor
says
was
the
saddest
of
the
alas
if
this
was
all
we
gave
then
were
our
eulogies
a
shame
unworthy
of
his
noble
name
a
mockery
around
his
grave
ii
a
month
has
passed
and
april
showers
have
come
and
gone
upon
the
scene
the
fields
are
turning
deeper
green
and
leaves
are
growing
into
bowers
the
and
violet
appear
among
old
leaves
and
grass
the
iris
stands
where
runnels
pass
into
the
larger
rivulet
the
sings
in
the
fields
the
thrush
chants
in
the
and
mid
the
marsh
and
from
the
sedge
the
blackbirds
merry
music
peals
thus
spring
has
conquered
gloom
the
spring
we
hoped
would
give
him
strength
its
life
increase
his
length
even
though
a
little
from
the
tomb
iii
but
in
our
heart
something
begins
to
stir
and
grow
and
take
a
shape
it
flings
away
the
dismal
crape
and
our
lamentation
wins
it
is
a
flower
of
rarest
hue
belonging
to
eternity
the
blossom
of
the
memory
of
what
in
him
was
good
and
true
with
this
we
will
his
grave
adorn
in
and
frost
its
beauty
never
shall
be
lost
but
growing
brighter
with
each
morn
iv
evening
and
the
clouds
hang
low
the
rain
has
the
livelong
day
but
in
the
west
there
is
a
ray
a
gentle
gleam
of
down
are
the
curtains
and
the
shades
where
hearts
in
silence
weep
and
brood
they
sadness

it

which
was
once
her
delight
that
it
could
meet
her
tearful
sight
from
the
verdant
brow
it
would
indeed
be
rude
to

to
those
around

cheerless
hearth

let
grief
depart
forget
the
clouds
which
gloomed
the
for
sorrow
like
a
swollen
stream
must
have
its
course
or
break
its
bounds
and
oft
its
bitterness
redounds
to
joy
of
which
we
did
not
dream
but
that
sweet
sunset
seems
to
say
was
a
good
man
and
a
just
best
can
honor
him
by
trust
him
who
leads
us
day
by

the
around
his
home
are
blossoming
there
is
the
hum
of
wings

droning

this
is
the
season
he
loved
best
to
labor
in
his

prune

trees
that
flourished
not
this
was
to
him
a
pleasant
rest
for
he
from
youth
was
child
he
loved
unfeigned
simplicity
he
found
it
in
the
field
and
tree
in
bird
and
beast
the
tame
and
wild
he
found
it
in
the
folk
he
loved
them
they
loved
him
again
he
was
the
poor
and
friend
his
feeding
tramps
became
a
joke
for

is
told
both
near
and
far
how
he
the
tramp
led
to
his
board
to
all
the
best
it
could
afford
then
offered
him
a
choice
cigar
forgive
a
smile
amid
the
tear
the
simple
hearts
will
understand
and
bless
the
kind
unstinted
hand
which
gave
to
them
new
hope
and
cheer

apple
trees

out

sweet
the
purple
pomp

stand
alone
they
stand
in

in
vain
their
lord
to
greet
vi
the
morning
lifts
its
saffron
veil
and
smiles
with
happiness
replete
with
sabbath
peace
it
doth
us
greet
and
with
the
risen
hail
it
mingles
with
the
mellow
sound
of
church
bells
calling
man
to
prayer

falls
upon

where
souls
disconsolate
are
found
no
more
along

aisles
shall
move
his
stately
figure
cloth
in
black
on
days
when
other
folk
seemed
slack
in
the
expression
of
their
love
not
to
repeat
a
senseless
creed
did
he
the
house
of
god
attend
but
none
like
he
his
ear
did
lend
to
truth
of
heart
and
human
need
he
was
a
seeker
after
truth
pursuing
it
on
flights
of
thought
his
mind
to
keenness
had
been
wrought
by
constant
study
even
from
youth
he
loved
the
truth
in
thought
and
life
he
hated
sham
and
cunning
cant
and
had
a
scornful
smile
for
rant
whose
purpose
was
to
gender
strife
the
protestant
and
catholic
he
judged
alike
from
human
view
both
were
his
friends
if
only
true
the
false
alone
a
heretic
no
honest
faith
he
did
scorn
but
saw
the
human
heart
in
all
the
upward
reaching
of
the
soul
the
waiting
for
a
better
morn
though
he
with
burns
did
sometimes
laugh
while
reading
prayer
or
satires
like
the
fair
or
for
when
we
cease
to
fear
and
dread
the
phantoms
of
a
darker
age
we
read
them
like
a
comic
page
and
smile
to
think
that
they
are
dead
the
darkness
from
faith
cast
out
and
truth
and
love
alone
its
good
then
he
shall
know
that
brotherhood
greatest
prophets
speak
about
then
man
the
heart
shall
know
the
and
nobler
meed
then
shall
his
life
be
one
grand
creed
the
measure
of
what
he
doth
trow
was
this
his
faith
he
never
told
except
in
modest
daily
deeds
he
said
no
prayers
nor
counted
beads
yet
was
he
one
of
true
fold

there
moves
along
the
street
and
lane
a
motley
crowd
of
old
and

anthem
has
been
sung
a
homily
preached
at
the
fane
it
moves
along
to
sound
of

and
muffled
drum
the

to
aid
the

is
to
the
breezes
laid
a
flag
which
bears
the
marks
of
strife
these
men
who
carried
it
on
high
amid
the
great
array
but
feebly
follow
it
to
where
their
fallen
comrads
lie
must
increase
but
i
decrease
thus
spake
the
prophet
long
ago
has
been
strengthened
so
boys
in
may
rest
in
peace
and
one
by
one
is
mustered
out
from
ranks
which
ever
thinner
grow
soon

a
remnant
we
shall
know
a
remnant
in
the
north
and
south

let
us
plant
our
flag
and
upon
their
grave
in
memory
of
what
they
were
what
we
should
be
in
this
the
larger
newborn
hour

most
of
all
let
us
be
kind
to
these
who
linger

you
never

boast
at

at

with
its
vain
distress
and
dark
bloody
streams

knew
the
brunt
of
bitter
fight
the
hardship
and
the
painful
wound
he
knew
the
cost
of
conquered
ground
the
price
of
freedom
and
of
right
he
knew
indeed
that
is
hell
and
did
not
proudly
speak
of
it
although
his
eyes
were
strangely
lit
when
campfire
stories
he
did
tell
but
peace
was
regnant
in
his
soul
he
dreamed
about
that
distant
day
when
man
shall
know
the
better
way
of
peace
on
earth
good
will
to
all
he
read
with
sorrow
of
the
war
which
mighty
nations
wage
to
him
it
seemed
an
insane
rage
which
a
soldier
must
deplore
it
cast
a
shadow
his
mind
to
think
that
progress
is
so
slow
that
highest
life
is
still
so
low
among
the
foremost
of
mankind
his
peace
increased
as
strength
declined
the
sad
plight
he
keenly
felt

human
hope
he
clearly
spelt
in
peace

with
truth
entwined

lazily
beneath

high

dreams

upon

brood
above

brief
beneath

arguments
set
forth
beneath

court

is
a
silent
manly
grief

thoughts
of
him
who
for
so
long
did
hold
the
chair
within
this
hall
leap
from
his
portrait
on
the
wall
to
men
whose
hearts
are
true
and
strong
it
seems
so
strange
he
is
not
there
to
guide
them
with
his
light
of
law
who
seldom
failed
the
right
to
know
whose
judgments
were
both
just
and
fair
whose
mind
cut
keenly
through
the
maze
of
subtlest
labyrinth
of
guilt
who
undeceived
by
tilt
pursued
serenely
ways
was
justice
clear
his
heart
was
more
he
pitied
where
the
law
was
plain
and
but
for
duty
he
had
fain
where
sorrow
did
implore

thee

thee

radiant

farewell
in

cressy
here
where
slopes
the
hill
into
the
vale
with
many
a
roof
and
and
spire
and
rows
of
lofty
elms
that
wan
and
pale
he
gazed
upon
the
sunset
and
its
fire
which
glowed
in
sky
and
river
on
the
green
and
curving
hills
and
hazy
plain
the
early
summer
was
upon
the
scene
all
fresh
and
verdant
after
days
of
rain
he
looked
upon
it
all
with
wistful
eye
his
arena
ere
he
went
to
die
what
thoughts
came
to
him
then
i
do
not
know
but
seldom
man
was
granted
better
place
to
take
farewell
with
everything
below
and
look
into
the
smiling
face
for
vesper
glorious
with
light
held
sweet
communion
with
the
days
of
yore
and
blessed
the
deeds
of
service
and
the
right
the
things
that
vanish
not
forevermore
and
saw
he
this
then
had
his
last
adieu
no
painful
pang
but
rather
that
he
knew
the
morrow
of
that
evening
would
be
fair
and
rich
in
great
and
good
realities
though
like
all
pilgrims
he
wist
hardly
where
the
homeland
looms
with
bright
felicities
with
cato
he
believed
must
be
that
this
strange
sojourn
is
not
all
in
vain
and
that
somewhere
the
longing
soul
shall
know
the
meaning
of
the
toil
and
pain
and
find
the
quest
for
which
he
daily
strove
embodied
in
the
light
of
truth
and
love
he
said
farewell
to
friends
of
many
years
as
sank
the
sun
behind
the
farthest
ridge
and
chilly
shadows
came
with
darksome
fears
to
those
who
homeward
turned
across
the
bridge
and
he
passed
on
with
that
which
i
see
without
the
feeling
of
a
mystery
the
train
of
life
the
unknown
destiny
the
ardent
hopes
the
crushing
misery
it
bears
along
as
with
a
magic
speed
the
wonder
of
the
age
the
and
in
its
speed
was
hope
for
at
the
end
stood
skill
and
wisdom
to
prolong
his
life
and
with
him
fared
a
kind
and
trusted
friend
and
more
than
all
his
devoted
wife
but
skill
and
most
consecrated
aid
could
not
prolong
a
life
that
was
complete
and
like
a
man
the
last
great
toll
he
paid
unfaltering
his
god
and
judge
to
meet
but
we
who
took
his
hand
upon
this
slope
with
parting
words
have
in
this
fitting
frame
of
nature
placed
his
life
of
work
and
hope
and
writ
upon
it
all
his
honored
name
a
name
that
lives
in
grateful
memories
of
those
to
whom
he
gave

one
in

fairer
than
the
of
rarest
hue
his
smile
sweet
as
the
morning
gleam
in
the
dew
and
as
we
looked
into
his
eyes
so
large
and
brown
it
seemed
an
angel
from
the
skies
had
just
come
down
what
heaven
gave
again
it
took
its
ways
are
good
but
now
in
pity
it
does
look
on
motherhood
whose
love
so
young
so
pure
so
deep
eats
bread
and
whispers
do
not
weep
he
is
not
a
funeral
of
a
child
on
christmas
eve
the
dusk
was
upon
hill
and
wood
upon
the
fields
of
soft
new
snow
the
in
acre
stood
with
branches
laden
bending
low
and
marble
shaft
and
monument
like
mystic
beings
draped
and
pale
seemed
listening
to
the
bells
that
sent
their
christmas
greeting
through
the
vale
around
an
open
little
grave
there
stood
a
group
of
weeping
folk
lord
hath
taken
what
he
gave
we
sorrow
not
as
without
hope
for
he
who
gave
us
christmas
eve
said
the
children
come
to
me
of
such
the
kingdom
is
they
live
with
him
in
joy
thus
spake
the
minister
of
god
but
still
the
heart
did
sob
and
when
they
heaped
the
frozen
clod
he
felt
that
his
hope
did
rob
congealing
tears
did
cease
to
fall
and
thicker
denser
grew
the
gloom
the
clang
jarred
on
his
soul
he
wished
that
grave
for
him
had
room
the
wreath
how
shall
i
shake
off
the
darkness
the
nightmare
that
feeds
on
my
soul
i
looked
through
the
windows
this
morning
upon
the
embankments
of
snow
that
ridged
to
the
porch
of
my
dwelling
and
covered
its
floor
where
a
half
buried
branch
of
an
rested
torn
from
a
discarded
back
of
the
church
the
terrible
wind
of
the
night
had
cut
it
and
carried
it
thither
where
in
the
white
like
a
wreath
it
protruded
its
green
a
wreath
for
the
dead
whose
soul
mid
the
storm
of
the
night
had
taken
its
o
god
how
utterly
eerie
it
seemed
to
my
mind
that
had
worried
alone
through
the
vigils
of
night
and
on
that
day
came
the
message
that
she
was
no
more
lines
written
on
receiving
news
of
my
death
i
sit
alone
in
the
night
is
cold
and
shrill
the
wind
i
make
a
church
out
of
my
room
to
find
some
solace
for
the
mind
oft
have
i
spoken
mid
the
throngs
of
such
who
pitied
the
bereaved
oft
have
i
listened
to
the
songs
which
other
burdened
hearts
relieved
but
with
my
grief
i
am
alone
far
from
the
scene
of
those
who
weep
within
the
old
ancestral
home
beyond
the
stormy
deep
i
have
his
picture
at
my
right
i
have
it
clearer
in
my
heart
for
blurred
and
darkened
is
the
sight
and
rays
of
mortal
day
depart
thou
wert
so
strong
so
brave
so
true
i
looked
to
thee
as
boy
and
youth
my
life
did
take
from
thee
its
hue
in
it
has
of
truth
thy
toil
thy
suffering
and
love
the
love
of
home
and
native
land
so
strangely
clear
come
to
me
now
like
blessings
of
an
honest
hand
thou
saidst
to
me
will
not
leave
the
land
wherein
thy
mother
rests
how
could
i
seek
thy
heart
to
grieve
with
all
this
new
varied
quests
farewell
i
may
not
see
the
place
where
they
have
laid
thee
by
her
side
but
memories
of
vanished
days
shall
ever
dear
with
me
abide
the
distance
would
not
let
me
lay
a
garland
on
thy
sable
bier
therefore
this
wreath
a
simple
lay
fresh
with
the
dew
of
many
a
tear
weave
out
of
my
heart
a
wreath
of
flowers
which
shall
blossom
there
like
those
red
on
the
heath
the
ling
which
winter
can
not
sere
the
great
strife
war
and
providence
above
the
monster
roaring
thunder
above
the
hailstorm
of
the
musketry
above
the
shrieking
shells
that
burst
asunder
with
crash
strongest
masonry
above
the
tumult
and
the
din
of
battle
the
loud
command
the
egging
call
above
the
groans
of
wounded
and
the
rattle
of
death
in
thousand
throats
above
it
all
there
is
a
hand
that
overrules
madness
and
causes
his
anger
him
to
praise
a
hand
which
from
destruction
grief
and
sadness
brings
better
prospects
for
the
struggling
race
the
hand
of
providence
which
in
all
ages
has
shaped
the
history
of
and
we
may
read
upon
its
pages
the
loving
purpose
of
the
mind
from
awful
carnage
ruin
sorrow
caused
by
a
greed
insane
and
pride
of
kings
there
will
arise
a
brighter
better
morrow
with
righteousness
and
healing
in
its
wings
a
day
of
freedom
when
the
thrones
must
tumble
a
day
when
nations
shall
cast
off
the
yoke
when
none
shall
batten
on
the
poor
and
humble
and
untruth
walk
about
in
priestly
cloak
when
celt
and
teuton
slav
and
shall
wisdom
learn
from
this
their
plunge
in
gore
and
cease
to
spend
their
strength
in
paying
tax
on
their
daily
bread
for
implements
of
war
when
they
shall
dwell
in
harmony
as
brothers
which
is
the
true
foundation
of
the
world
when
good
of
one
is
good
of
all
the
others
then
will
his
banner
be
unfurled
the
yellow
peril
written
after
having
heard
the
hon
duncan
lecture
on
japanese
in
the
races
of
the
east
shall
rise
like
floods
in
with
fury
of
the
hungry
beast
and
homeless
in
their
native
clime
shall
shelter
seek
in
this
great
land
woe
then
to
us
if
unprepared
we
are
the
influx
to
withstand
remember
rome
and
how
she
fared
her
wealth
and
vineyards
did
allure
the
goth
the
vandal
and
the
hun
their
hordes
swooped
down
while
quite
secure
she
dwelt
beneath
her
proud
of
her
past
and
opulent
she
scorned
the
wild
advancing
foe
but
found
full
soon
her
legions
spent
in
warding
off
the
fatal
blow
she
fell
and
alien
nations
took
the
scepter
from
her
feeble
hand
thus
written
is
the
judgment
book
let
statesmen
read
and
understand
the
yellow
peril
from
the
east
from
nippon
and
from
old
cathay
will
come
unbidden
to
the
feast
if
we
neglect
to
guard
the
way
the
veteran
eighty
winters
have
turned
him
white
white
of
beard
and
of
crown
slackened
his
steps
and
dimmed
his
sight
bent
him
and
weighed
him
down
not
only
with
war
but
with
toils
of
peace
toil
of
the
life
now
at
eighty
he
takes
his
ease
the
fruit
of
his
years
is
rife
proud
he
is
of
the
things
achieved
glad
for
things
as
they
are
greater
far
than
he
once
believed
when
new
was
his
but
he
lives
in
the
past
and
speaks
often
of
bloody
frays
of
roaring
guns
and
shrieks
in
dark
rebellion
days
bull
run
chancellorsville
but
most
three
days
fight
charge
and
the
thousands
lost
burying
them
in
the
night
these
are
subjects
on
which
he
dwells
for
he
himself
was
there
younger
he
seems
while
he
sits
and
tells
a
smouldering
fire
seems
flare
tales
of
war
by
a
man
who
loves
peace
and
good
will
among
men
veterans
pride
without
silken

calling
the

his

he
and
says
war
is

peace
is
the

costlier

than

tell

did
the

reading
a
on

our

such

still
feel
that
my

with
a

lifting

down

look

young

a
cry
arises
from
the

a
cry
of
anguish
dying
in
despair
and
with
horrors
is
the

engirt
the
prince
of
darkness
ruleth
in
the

the

are
passing
and
the
kingdoms
fall
and
cosmos
trembles
like
an
autumn
leaf
what
seemed
the
greatest
sinks
into
the
small
and
what
seemed
glory
changes
into
grief
the
jewelled
crowns
and
diadems
are
cast
into
the
balance
of
the
only
just
they
are
like
chaff
which
scattered
by
the

is
lost
and
mingles
with

the

arrived
at

new
shall
be
their

upon
the
morn
now
dawning
from
the
night
a
may
morning
from
purple
woods
the
notes
are
flowing
as
deep
and
melancholy
as
the
night
whose
shadows
from
the
early
glowing
now
take
their
flight
so
sweetly
clear
and
gently
wooing
they
bring
my
soul
an
exquisite
delight
a
crow
comes
shrilly
from
afar
and
wakes
loud
answers
in
the
yard
they
greet
the
coming
of
car
like
many
a
modern
and
accepted
bard
but
to
the
woodland
notes
compared
they
are
so
challenging
and
hard
the
farmer
rises
wearily
from
bed
looks
on
the
morn
and
smiles
that
it
is
fair
for
he
must
toil
that
others
may
be
fed
and
providence
has
placed
on
him
its
care
while
others
fight
and
mingle
with
the
dead
to
nourish
hope
and
life
becomes
his
share
but
who
has
eyes
and
ears
for
ways
who
goes
to
matin
at
the
call
when
man
his
brother
man
so
foully
slays
and
nations
into
utter
ruin
fall
must
war
obscure
the
rosy
rays
and
keep
a
music
from
the
soul
a
time
like
this
demands
the
bread
and
meat
but
also
music
for
the
famished
heart
and
we
should
rise
the
better
things
to
greet
be
they
in
nature
or
in
perfect
art
lest
struggling
man
at
last
must
fall
beneath
the
load
in
which
now
all
men
have
a
part
my
letter
in
the
city
of
tents
by
the
restless
sea
my
long
has
dwelt
since
fate
has
put
forth
her
dark
decree
and
strangely
our
future
is
spelt
by
the
horrors
of
things
to
be
and
i
think
in
his
heart
he
begins
to
know
the
meaning
which
glamor
obscured
for
his
words
are
like
cups
that
overflow
with
things
which
he
has
endured
though
never
just
saying
so
for
he
is
as
brave
and
more
i
ween
than
many
a
and
courage
excels
in
his
cheerful
mien
he
even
tries
to
make
others
glad
this
sailor
of
seventeen
but
a
letter
arrived
the
other
day
to
his
little
sister
of
seven
to
whom
he
wrote
in
a
childlike
way
of
things
in
a
vision
given
and
this
is
what
he
did
say
stood
on
the
shore
of
the
moonlit
lake
where
the
billows
came
rolling
high
the
sound
of
the
sea
did
my
soul
awake
to
the
music
and
westwinds
sigh
and
to
musings
of
my
own
i
saw
on
the
whitecapped
waves
my
dear
ones
come
to
me
for
the
heart
perceives
what
most
it
craves
on
the
dark
turbulent
sea
the
sea
of
clamoring
i
saw
you
dance
on
the
foamy
crest
like
a
naiad
or
spirit
fair
and
mother
and
all
whom
i
love
best
did
beckon
to
me
out
there
in
the
wind
from
the
plains
of
the
i
called
on
you
all
by
your
dearest
name
as
lonely
i
stood
that
night
but
none
of
you
heard
me
and
none
of
you
came
but
vanished
full
soon
from
my
sight
like
the
sheen
of
a
dying
it
may
have
been
the
mist
from
the
spray
or
something
like
that
which
blurred
my
eyes
as
i
tried
to
look
away
and
only
the
moan
of
the
billows
i
heard
as
they
came
in
a
wild
went
to
my
little
tent
in
the
camp
all
cold
in
the
april
night
my
bed
was
cheerless
and
chill
and
damp
and
my
heart
was
heavy
as
i
did
write
in
the
light
of
the
bright
the
bugle
call
america
awake
awake
put
on
thy
armor
for
the
hour
has
come
when
freedom
is
at
stake
arise
and
show
thy
power
and
now
as
in
thy
youth
the
shackles
break
and
let
the
truth
which
made
thee
great
decide
the
destiny
of
mankind
ere
too
late
to
thee
the
world
is
looking
for
salvation
thou
hast
it
give
it
in

and
it
will
make
thee
tenfold
more
a
nation
withhold
it

on
thee
shall
be
the
blame
of
ages
and
the
shame
this
is
the
which
like
a
fire
brings
forth
the
real
worth
for
men
from
every
clime
is
now
this
but
we
shall
joy
to
see
the
gold
of
love
is
there
for
home
and
liberty
and
loyalty
shall
be
their
watchword
everywhere

thy

are
hearing

old
glory
to
the

with
faith
abounding
and
this
emblem
of
the

sacred

from

in

they
come
by
thousands
on

speeding
trains
to

and

still
thou

art
half
asleep
entranced
by
pleasant
ease
thou
dreamest
yet
of
peace
for
it
seems
far
across
the
deep
where
death
and
grave
a
harvest
reap
it
seems
so
far
away
the

like

before
uplifted
faces
no
longer
as
a
play
we
fling
it
to
the
breezes
with
thoughtless
praise
on
when
each
acts
as
he
pleases
but
like
a
sacramental
act
its
raising
is
attended
when
loyal
hearts
behold
a
pact
in
colors
sweetly
blended
when
men
responsive
to
its
call
make
grim
determination
that
tyranny
at
last
must
fall
before
a
freeborn
nation
and
as
it
waves
above
their
heads
like
a
benediction
which
sacredness
and
glory
sheds
on
men
of
just
conscription
they
stand
aloof
they
seem

the

sing
their

lullabies
with
memories

at

sat
by

gazed
with
wonder
on

how
in

lost

peace
upon
her
weary

full
tired
of

and

do
i
turn
to
nature
in
her
sweet
midwinter
dreams
to
purple
twilights
when
the
last
beams
like
candles
on
the
snowdrifts
burn
while
star
and
crescent
in
the
deepest
blue
shed
peace
on
fields
and
woods
and
frozen
lakes
and
from
the
creeping
shadows
soon
awakes
the
one
as
boy
i
knew
in
unfeigned
joy
that
varied
with
each
scene
of
whiteness
or
green
the
dormant
earth
dreams
of
the
life
to
be
when
spring
returns
to
call
it
from
the
grave
when
through
its
breast
shall
rush
the
ardent
wave
of
love
and
hope
and
songs
of
ecstasy
but
in
the
moonlight
and
the
shadows
dun
the
dreams
appear
in
emblems
vague
and
frore
like
wandering
spectres
from
a
mystic
shore
which
track
the
glory
of
the
setting
sun
like
love
that
plays
behind
a
rosy
screen
because
yet
too
modest
to
be
seen
the
winter
heavy
hangs
on
humankind
in
homes
and
camps
and
on
the
stormy
seas
on
battlefields
whose
miseries
appall
with
horrors
every
normal
mind
its
million
graves
decked
with
the
covering
of
jewelled
purity
where
heroes
sleep
at
whose
low
crosses
countless
hearts
must
weep
is
holy
ground
where
life
shall
take
its
wing
to
truer
freedom
and
a
larger
love
with
peace
on
earth
and
good
will
from
above
our
dream
that
when
the
breath
shall
wake
to
life
and
gladness
all
the
land
like
risen
our
chosen
youth
shall
stand
around
the
flag
which
means
the
death
that
like
the
life
which
quickens
everything
our
hosts
from
south
and
north
and
east
and
west
shall
fare

the
crest
and

no

hundred
long
miles

over

here
the

heaps

its
bleached
bones
bear
witness

yes
here

a
wildness
which
bids
my
soul
to
saddle
my
pony
and
ride
away
and
follow
its
weird
and
mysterious
call
to
freedom
complete
if
just
for
a
day
to
follow
the
paths
where
the
bison
did
roam
to

to
the
coyotes

at

be
unto
thee
who
these
wonders
hast
wrought
mountain
peaks
lofty
all
and
hoary
thou
alone
knowest
their
wonderful
story
when
from
the
bowels
of
the
earth
they
were
brought
strangest
formations
and
glaciers
beaming
cataracts
rushing
from
dizziest
heights
emerald
rivers
with
great
swiftness
streaming
rivulets
rushing
and
gleaming
did
i
witness
more
glorious
sights
down
in
the
valley
the
flowers
are
growing
trees
too
yea
forests
are
flourishing
there
sweetly
their
fragrance
on
cool
breezes
flowing
terrible
grandeur
is
meek
beauty
wooing
happy
the
the
harmony
rare
thus
is
the
image

who
this
has
detected
be
he
yet
never
dejected
since
he
o
father
may
sit
at
thy
feet
mount
shasta
when
from
the
fiery
pangs
of
earth
this
queen
of
mountains
was
brought
forth
the
spirits
of
the
air
desired
to
dress
her
in
the
sheen
and
glory
of
their
pure
celestial
love
they
gave
her
for
a
veil
the
fleecy
cloud
which
gently
floats
about
her
lofty
brow
they
gave
her
for
a
mantle
to
enshroud
her
shoulders
strong
the
ever
glittering
snow
and
then
they
called
upon
the
fir
and
pine
to
weave
a
robe
of
never
fading
green
and
with
the
silver
stream
their
wool
entwine
that
here
and
there
its
bright
gleam
might
be
seen
she
thus
adorned
has
stood
for
eons
long
the
queen
among
the
mountains
of
the
west
in
beauty
cloth
inspiring
men
to
song
and
lifting
human
thoughts
to
what
is
best
verses
written
while
sailing
from
vancouver
to
seattle
seen
the
forest
and
mountains
seen
the
far
stretching
plain
but
oh
for
a
whiff
of
the
briny
sea
and
a
journey
across
the
main
oh
then
does
my
soul
find
its
pleasure
akin
to
my
childhood
joy
for
my
home
was
close
to
the
seashore
and
i
lived
with
the
fjord
as
a
boy
its
unbounded
freedom
and
greatness
created
a
love
in
my
soul
and
never
i
sail
the
surging
sea
but
voice
does
me
call
its
mystery
aye
and
its
music
have
followed
me
all
the
way
and
borne
as
they
are
by
the
foaming
wave
they
blend
in
an
unsung
lay
and
all
day
long
do
i
listen
and
all
day
long
do
i
look
to
freedom
which
never
was
to
songs
that
were
never
in
book
to
an
unknown
musician
verses
written
while
listening
to
a
melody
played
on
board
the
charlotte
sailing
through
the
strait
of
juan
de
fuca
what
is
charms
and
grandeur
when
compared
to
what
man
is
in
his
sorrows
and
his
longings
in
his
triumphs
and
his
bliss
oh
a
soul
that
hath
such
feelings
as
the
one
who
now
doth
play
such
a
depth
of
true
emotions
lives
in
eternal
day
thou
unconsciously
hast
moved
me
a
captive
at
thy
will
though
in
thousand
leagues
of
journey
oft
my
soul
has
had
its
fill
of
the
beauty
of
creation
known
its
raptures
and
delight
yet
not
once
such
inspiration
has
possessed
me
as
tonight
play
play
on
thou
sweet
musician
while
the
darkness
gathers
round
while
our
ship
is
speeding
onward
with
a
rhythmic
rushing
sound
while
the
stars
look
down
upon
us
mirrored
in
the
tranquil
sea
render
thy
interpretation
of
joy
and
misery
seattle
a
meditation
thou
princess
of
the
sea
how
thou
hast
grown
since
last
i
saw
thee
and
how
beautiful
the
must
to
thee
have
blown
the
ardent
health
which
nothing
wrong
could
dull
the
blood
of
races
mingle
in
thy
veins
the
spirit
of
two
worlds
have
met
in
thee
most
genial
and
free
thou
here
dost
reign
a
charming
princess
of
the
western
sea
it
was
with
thee
i
did
a
year
abide
a
year
so
antithetically
mixed
when
painful
doubts
forbade
me
to
confide
and
career
confessed
still
was
unfixed
may
be
it
was
thy
spirit
which
i
felt
that
gave
me
song
and
oriental
dreams
and
when
in
occidental
shrines
i
knelt
of
oriental
truth
there
came
bright
gleams
and
hath
not
doubts
been
harassing
my
soul
and
had
i
shunned
to
give
a
heed
to
fears
but
followed
like
thyself
the
call
how
different
had
been
the
lapsing
years
perhaps
i
then
with
glory
now
could
meet
the
growth
and
life
i
see
on
every
hand
but
now
i
sit
in
sorrow
at
thy
feet
and
find
my
name
was
written
in
the
sand
gjoa
capt
ship
in
san
francisco
within
the
sound
of
the
roar
stands
gjoa
amid
palms
and
myrtle
trees
her
prow
is
lifted
toward
the
rocky
shore
as
if
impatient
for
the
stormy
seas
the
sturdy
little
ship
of
arctic
fame
which
bears
from
storms
and
ice
full
many
a
mark
now
like
a
lion
in
a
cage
grown
tame
stands
here
a
relic
only
in
a
park
a
precious
relic
to
norwegian
hearts
with
pride
and
gratitude
they
look
on
thee
proud
that
thou
sailed
where
man
had
made
no
charts
the
first
explorer
of
a
strait
and
sea
and
grateful
that
the
land
of
vikings
still
has
sons
of
courage
and
adventure
bold
for
roald
amundsen
forever
will
remain
a
man
of
true
heroic
mold
and
thou
art
here
incaged
to
sniff
the
brine
forsaken
by
the
captain
and
his
crew
a
monument
the
great
throngs
to
remind
what
talent
mixed
with
manliness
can
do
and
that
a
nation
may
be
small
yet
great
be
poor
and
still
excel
in
noblest
ken
a
silent
witness
at
the
golden
gate
a
glory
is
her
greatest
men
the
grave
in
the
desert
amid
the
plains
of
yellow
sand
and
cactus
encircled
by
the
distant
barren
hills
amid
the
awful
desert
of
nevada
beneath
the
glaring
sun
which
burns
and
kills
there
is
a
lonely
grave
where
the
san
padro
fast
speeds
from
of
los
angeles
a
lonely
grave
just
by
the
which
kindly
hands
unselfishly
did
bless
a
wooden
cross
is
standing
at
its
head
on
which
no
name
nor
date
they
did
inscribe
still
half
in
ruin
it
stands
there
to
bless
an
unknown
sleeper
of
the
wandering
tribe
and
at
the
foot
the
symbol
of
his
life
no
fitter
epitaph
on
any
grave
for
man
is
but
a
restless
sojourner
so
there
they
placed
the
handworn
stave
who
was
he
none
can
tell
some
say
a
tramp
who
stole
a
ride
and
crushed
was
the
wheels
but
tramps
are
also
men
and
sometimes
more
of
worth
than
their
unhappy
plight
reveals
but
this
i
know
he
was
a
son
who
still
may
wonder
how
her
boy
does
fare
who
still
perchance
is
praying
for
this
one
the
chiefest
object
of
her
loving
care
may
be
some
other
hearts
are
looking
for
his
coming
home
though
after
many
years
who
think
of
him
as
he
was
in
his
youth
and
seldom
speak
his
name
except
with
tears
who
know
not
of
this
solitary
grave
where
death
and
weird
oblivion
do
reign
where
all
seems
hopeless
save
the
crumbling
cross
which
shall
at
last
mystery
explain
the
mountains
of
the
prophet
in
the
purple
of
the
morning
through
the
dreamy
haze
of
day
spring
did
the
salt
lake
loom
before
us
as
the
desert
we
were
leaving
far
behind
us
mountains
of
the
prophet
did
i
mutter
without
thinking
came
the
words
as
if
repeated
after
some
one
who
knew
better
after
one
whose
inspiration
was
from
truth
and
heavenly
wisdom
and
instinctively
i
pondered
that
the
eyes
had
often
lifted
been
to
these
blue
mountains
whence
his
help
should
come
and
glory
of
the
lord
appear
to
zion
and
which
the
trail
was
winding
bloody
trail
of
weary
pilgrims
seeking
an
abiding
city
guarded
by
their
rugged
fastness
and
the
wide
expanse
of
salt
lake
here
where
seemed
but
barren
desert
did
the
eye
see
visions
of
a
city
and
a
temple
where
the
saints
should
dwell
in
where
in
peace
they
god
might
worship
and
this
vision
now
made
real
lends
a
lustre
to
the
mountains
gives
a
romance
to
their
valleys
and
their
names
may
be
i
call
them
mountains
of
the
prophet
chicago
o
wonder
of
our
age
consummate
wonder
not
of
state
alone
but
of
our
land
unique
among
the
cities
dost
thou
stand
upon
the
page
of
history
in
youth
and
might
thou
didst
spring
forth
as
in
a
night
from
where
the
redman
roved
along
the
dreamy
shores
of
michigan
where
years
ago
thy
life
began
some
fairy
moved
her
wand
upon
thee
for
like
a
fabled
urban
didst
thou
grow
colossal
mart
of
commerce
like
the
heart
thou
sendest
out
through
arteries
and
veins
pulsating
life
into
the
world
napoleons
of
are
marshalling
their
forces
with
colors
high
unfurled
not
on
horses
to
madly
fight
to
kill
and
blight
but
to
employ
each
to
make
thee
stronger
better
every
newborn
hour
thy
mighty
citadels
of
stone
so
huge
so
tall
so
many
and
immense
that
with
their
burden
mother
earth
seems
groan
throb
with
a
life
intense
and
from
thy
canyons
we
call
streets
great
constant
roar
us
meets
great
is
thy
wealth
great
is
thy
woe
less
great
thy
health
but
great
is
its
foe
within
thy
pale
the
great
extremes
of
good
and
evil
dwell
felicities
of
heavenly
dreams
and
hopelessness
of
hell
above
thy
scum
of
things
the
voice
of
heaven
sings
july
the
isle
of
dreams
the
island
of
dreams
lies
not
far
away
encompassed
by
sunlight
and
sea
i
happened
to
reach
it
the
other
day
while
breezes
were
playing
so
languidly
my
boat
scarcely
moved
on
the
bay
and
this
is
the
island
i
happened
to
find
the
isle
the
glittering
deep
a
bower
with
luxuriant
foliage
entwined
rocks
that
are
mossy
and
steep
where
shadows
give
rest
to
the
mind
and
here
in
the
shade
is
a
clear
cooling
spring
which
ceaselessly
murmurs
its
song
and
down
in
a
glade
the
brown
thrushes
sing
in
afternoons
drowsy
and
long
in
hours
that
bear
dreams
on
their
wings
and
balm
for
the
spirit
have
they
of
duty
forgetfulness
sweet
with
fragrance
of
roses
they
lead
you
astray
to
realms
of
fair
visions
replete
bright
visions
of
the
fairies
are
here
and
the
unreal
things
derided
by
men
of
pure
facts
though
science
doth
saunter
here
sometimes
she
clings
to
prophetical
acts
and
out
of
the
dreamland
them
brings
yea
great
things
are
born
in
this
enchanted
place
where
poets
do
loiter
and
rest
beholding
fair
visions
which
beckon
their
race
to
vistas
more
lofty
and
blest
in
immaculate
ways
lake
harriet
behold
the
noiseless
sailboat
and
canoe
that
slowly
glide
upon
the
glassy
lake
which
wedded
seems
to
lofty
blue
and
every
silver
cloud
within
its
wake
the
lonely
youth
dreams
as
he
moves
along
and
who
can
tell
what
wondrous
dreams
they
be
fit
theme
i
ween
for
any
song
of
sadness
or
of
gladsome
reverie
there
also
sail
the
lover
and
his
lass
they
laugh
and
chat
and
have
a
gleeful
time
for
them
the
golden
moments
swiftly
pass
since
they
are
living
in
summer
clime
to
them
sweet
beauty
doth
exist
as
background
only
to
their
happiness
and
the
harriet
has
kist
because
their
own
true
love
they
dare
confess
and
the
water
strains
from
lohengrin
come
floating
from
the
stand
and
add
enchantment
to
the
charming
scene
the
of
sky
and
sea
and
land
the
hymeneal
of
dreams
of
life
of
hearts
aglow
with
sweet
fervency
of
thousand
souls
who
here
forget
their
strife
and
for
an
hour
their
wonted
misery
the
cubist
i
wandered
in
an
institute
a
wonderful
palace
of
art
and
this
i
can
say
in
spirit
and
truth
it
was
a
delight
to
my
heart
to
see
how
the
masters
of
ages
past
have
found
a
place
in
this
shrine
till
i
came
to
a
room
methinks
the
last
which
the
contortions
confine
a
disgrace
i
said
to
allow
in
this
place
what
lunatic
homes
should
adorn
an
insult
to
art
and
the
human
race
of
spirits
degenerate
born
a
meaningless
daub
a
horrid
display
of
colors
and
lines
and
all
but
then
to
myself
i
also
did
say
may
be
the
age
and
its
soul
a
wicked
word
it
was
this
to
say
as
i
left
for
the
congested
street
and
followed
the
masses
which
made
their
way
to
a
place
where
ten
thousand
did
meet
three
times
a
day
to
be
edified
with
burlesque
in
jesus
name
and
painfully
in
my
soul
it
cried
cubist
again
just
the
same
i
glanced
at
a
paper
at
hour
of
sleep
and
found
a
whole
page
about
bards
who
gained
a
renown
by
a
single
leap
with
something
which
all
art
discards
again
i
said
the
age
a
prophet
is
he
after
all
of
the
church
and
the
stage
and
the
printed
page
of
the
age
that
has
bartered
its
soul
the
handclasp
full
thousands
of
leagues
over
land
over
seas
i
travelled
for
two
things
to
find
from
work
and
its
routine
a
needed
surcease
and
knowledge
to
quicken
the
mind
i
moved
mid
the
crowds
in
the
cities
of
fame
i
pondered
their
pleasures
and
pride
a
stranger
alone
wherever
i
came
i
heard
but
the
surge
of
the
tide
though
knowledge
increased
with
the
sight
of
the
new
though
grandeur
gave
thrills
of
delight
though
marvelling
oft
at
the
things
man
can
do
yet
weariness
came
with
the
night
and
i
longed
for
the
sound
of
the
voice
of
a
friend
i
longed
for
my
home
far
away
when
behold
i
met
one
at
a
end
at
the
close
of
a
wearisome
day
the
clasp
of
his
hand
with
the
love
of
his
heart
the
warm
and
the
genuine
grip
brought
greater
delight
than
the
sight
of
all
art
and
all
wonderful
things
of
the
trip
a
country
store
beside
a
winding
country
road
a
house
unique
one
sees
it
used
to
be
the
abode
now
that
of
groceries
a
church
with
graveyard
in
its
rear
where
many
saints
do
sleep
o
could
they
rise
i
greatly
fear
it
would
be
for
to
weep
beholding
what
the
years
have
wrought
in
changes
of
the
place
how
man
for
gain
has
rudely
sought
its
to
efface
for
here
where
generations
met
to
worship
god
in
truth
now
mammon
has
his
motto
set
with
vandal
hand
uncouth
where
once
did
sound
the
holy
word
by
men
of
earnest
heart
now
bargainings
are
daily
heard
the
language
of
the
mart
where
once
the
altar
stood
now
stands
a
stove
around
which
sit
the
unholy
bands
and
swear
and
lie
and
spit
and
could
each
much
neglected
mound
yield
up
its
dust
to
life
again
the
words
of
christ
would
then
resound
house
ye
made
a
but
thus
our
sacrilegious
age
is
blinded
by
the
god
of
gold
soon
finished
is
its
sacred
page
our
days
of
worship
told
sunsets
on
clearwater
lake
to
a
path
of
trembling
gold
from
where
i
stand
across
the
limpid
lake
to
darkling
woods
upon
the
far
off
strand
where
glory
broods
until
it
changes
into
rose
a
livid
pink
suffusing
all
the
mighty
deep
repose
and
as
the
fiery
ball
drops
into
clouds
on
the
rim
the
hue
most
delicate
takes
on
a
crimson
glow
in
which
the
shadows
of
the
shore
grow
dim
and
slowly
all
things
into
darkness
flow
anon
the
moon
appears
and
clothes
the
scene
and
floating
into
languid
sheen
a
sea
of
fire
in
which
a
sky
of
lavender
and
blue
and
red
together
with
the
clouds
of
changing
dye
reflected
are
divinely
wed
and
we
who
rove
about
are
led
by
an
illusion
such
as
seldom
seen
a
strange
receding
of
the
deep
as
if
we
sat
above
a
waterfall
which
our
skiff
full
soon
must
leap
into
immensity
bright
hyaline
where
brooding
spirits
beck
and
call
a
glorious
view
is
heaven
in
the
depth
of
tranquil
seas
but
more
its
virtues
mirrored
in
a
human
heart
and
thou
who
hast
its
kindnesses
so
kept
that
changing
vistas
or
receding
shore
can
not
extinguish
immortal
part
in
the
abiding
love
divine
as
clear
as
all
this
evening
glory
in
a
glassy
mere
art
more
than
all
what
nature
can
express
whose
word
can
cheer
whose
gentle
hand
can
bless
illusions
much
is
but
illusions
fear
and
all
the
ghosts
that
troop
with
it
the
good
alone
in
all
its
sweet
effusion
is
real
as
the
sun
by
which
the
world
is
lit
the
cataract
of
death
the
dread
abyss
does
not
exist
for
all
the
light
is
his
the
rising
hide
the
departure
from
our
gaze
a
heavy
mist
begins
to
glide
across
the
ashen
face
a
host
of
swallows
circling
fly
like
cavalcades
upon
a
plain
a
myriad
of
insects
die
uncounted
lives
like
drops
of
rain
lost
in
the
sea
lost
in
the
all
the
life
the
death
the
oversoul
and
little
children
laugh
and
play
upon
the
beach
and
on
the
pier
in
them
the
closing
of
the
day
with
gathering
storm
awakes
no
fear
for
in
their
souls
the
light
remains
that
oped
the
breast
and
woke
the
glad
refrain
and
all
the
heart
of
nature
blest
what
matters
though
the
clouds
obscure
its
finished
course
one
single
eve
if
we
like
children
can
allure
even
clouds
and
mist
to
pleasure
give
the
wavelets
blind
my
sight
and
neath
the
hand
i
needs
must
scan
the
dazzling
shimmer
of
the
light
which
like
seraphic
highways
span
the
glad
expanse
methinks
i
see
the
naiads
dance
to
music
of
the
swaying
reeds
and
rushes
where
the
narrows
jut
adorned
with
weeds
from
gardens
freshly
cut
amid
the
glimmer
one
discerns
a
boat
wherein
a
youth
doth
stand
like
passing
turn
its
prow
with
dreamy
ease
from
land
the
well
nigh
naked
youth
to
me
is
like
a
god
of
grecian
mould
whose
perfect
form
and
symmetry
is
like
of
old
he
speaks
to
fellows
in
the
deep
whose
heads
move
the
curling
gleams
alas
that
death
should
ever
reap
among
such
scenes
of
pleasant
dreams
but
nature
always
clamors
for
what
she
hath
lent
to
life
a
while
and
though
we
borrow
more
and
more
and
all
her
powers
do
beguile
yet
comes
the
hour
on
land
or
sea
she
asks
for
all
with
usury
the
boy
lifts
up
his
hands
and
dives
a
pleasant
plunge
that
has
no
dread
but
i
recall
some
precious
lives
which
thus
were
reckoned
the
dead
and
in
my
heart
at
end
of
day
a
prayer
for
the
lads
i
say
song
of
the
the
waves
song
of
the
billows
as
the
lave
the
shoreline
with
a
mystic
moan
song
of
the
rushes
in
the
shallow
song
of
the
aspen
tree
and
sallow
ever
as
the
undertone
song
of
cicadas
and
the
cricket
from
ragged
grasses
and
the
thicket
song
of
the
whirring
that
goes
to
sea
but
for
to
die
song
of
the
warblers
flitting
nigh
song
of
the
weird
distant
cry
song
of
a
horn
on
yonder
hill
that
echoes
in
the
far
away
the
tone
is
soft
as
of
a
rill
end
of
a
perfect
as
sinks
the
sun
and
i
depart
with
all
this
music
in
my
heart
twilight
a
dull
pink
evening
sky
a
white
ridge
below
the
tall
dark
trees
near
by
in
the
deep
snow
two
horses
one
is
white
as
white
as
is
the
snow
the
other
black
as
darkest
night
along
the
highway
go
one
emblem
of
the
parting
day
the
other
of
approaching
night
and
the
hill
the
rosy
ray
of
this
one
delight
april
o
i
love
the
month
of
april
when
the
southwind
gently
blows
calling
nature
from
its
slumber
from
cold
long
repose
till
the
meadow
its
awakening
by
a
tint
of
verdure
shows
and
the
willow
with
bright
saffron
in
the
evening
sunshine
glows
when
the
is
standing
on
the
with
its
throat
lifted
up
to
merry
lovesongs
which
across
the
prairies
float
when
the
robin
on
the
proudly
stands
in
his
red
coat
then
makes
departure
with
a
shrill
and
happy
note
when
the
air
is
full
of
meaning
clothed
in
sweet
mystery
touching
all
things
with
its
magic
even
with
ecstasy
and
you
see
it
and
you
feel
it
it
is
upon
land
and
sea
it
is
easter
dawning
after
drear
gethsemane
and
the
faces
brighten
and
their
laughter
has
a
ring
which
no
could
give
them
and
no
lamplight
play
could
bring
even
the
aged
in
whose
bosom
enchantments
seldom
sing
take
a
pleasure
in
the
message
of
this
happy
month
of
spring
jocund
april
lovely
april
of
all
months
my
choice
thou
art
since
in
thee
there
is
a
solace
for
all
weary
heart
and
in
thee
there
is
a
promise
that
we
all
shall
have
a
part
in
the
hope
which
man
professes
through
his
worship
and
his
art
a
part
of
the
wind
and
the
curling
wave
a
part
of
the
wind
and
the
curling
wave
of
the
budding
trees
and
the
tender
blade
a
part
of
the
life
that
has
burst
its
grave
of
crocus
and
buttercup
studding
the
glade
of
the
bush
and
the
shadow
it
throws
of
the
moss
on
the
rocks
and
the
slender
ferns
of
the
burly
weed
that
earliest
grows
and
all
that
quickens
and
upward
yearns
a
part
of
the
light
and
the
golden
flash
of
the
wing
the
glittering
pond
of
the
sable
crow
in
the
lofty
ash
his
mate
in
the
trees
beyond
of
the
gossamer
wing
and
flight
of
the
insect
just
risen
from
sleep
of
things
that
find
in
the
sun
delight
whether
they
blossom
or
fly
or
creep
a
part
of
the
risen
life
and
the
all
eternal
spirit
anew
each
spring
wherefore
i
follow
its
kindly
call
to
hear
the
carol
his
angels
sing
what
saith
it
o
you
must
hear
it
alone
in
the
paths
of
the
woods
on
an
april
day
and
feel
as
i
do
you
are
truly
one
with
nature
to
fathom
the
glorious
lay
the
chipping
sparrow
the
clouds
are
hanging
dark
and
low
the
budding
trees
are
still
quite
bare
and
from
the
north
the
cold
winds
blow
of
spring
we
almost
might
despair
but
from
the
branches
ashen
gray
outside
my
window
comes
a
song
a
warbling
chipping
lay
to
cold
and
dimness
nonchalant
his
music
has
a
thrilling
joy
it
warms
the
soul
allures
a
smile
its
brooding
doubts
he
does
destroy
and
makes
it
happy
like
a
child
and
now
a
sudden
cheering
gleam
falls
on
him
from
a
rift
of
blue
i
see
him
in
a
golden
dream
i
know
that
song
alone
is
true
his
crimson
tuft
a
crown
his
tawny
breast
a
badge
of
love
and
that
clear
sunray
coming
down
our
watchful
eye
above
in
the
when
the
fragrance
of
the
purple
and
lavender
meets
the
sweet
distilled
aroma
from
the
plum
and
and
the
dainty
scent
of
violets
amid
the
the
music
of
the
hum
and
drone
of
bees
then
my
soul
takes
up
its
harp
which
long
upon
the
willows
hung
and
attunes
it
to
the
gladness
that
is
floating
in
the
air
for
it
is
in
that
everything
grows
young
and
the
heart
of
man
is
lighter
and
has
little
less
of
care
in
the
it
seems
the
brown
thrush
blithest
sings
and
the
cooes
the
deepest
from
a
breast
brimful
with
love
and
the
glad
music
clearest
the
branches
rings
to
its
mate
that
sits
abrooding
on
the
nest
upon
the
bough
and
the
is
calling
from
the
woodlands
dark
at
eve
with
a
zest
which
makes
the
farmer
feel
that
even
the
night
hath
song
and
in
the
cool
of
day
he
thinks
it
is
quite
good
to
live
after
toil
i
here
can
rest
the
in
the
methinks
are
children
happiest
since
with
that
coming
a
great
liberty
draws
nigh
the
days
of
school
are
over
and
they
feel
supremely
blest
in
the
days
mid
glories
the
blue
and
open
sky
or
to
lie
beneath
the
lilacs
with
a
in
hand
reading
perfume
into
fancies
puck
and
fairies
twixt
each
line
till
the
heart
is
with
them
dancing
in
a
happy
wonderland
while
the
shadows
of
the
with
lilac
hues
combine
in
the
the
lovers
often
fondly
meet
and
drink
the
odor
a
true
potency
for
dreams
and
oftest
when
the
makes
it
a
tenfold
sweet
like
a
tear
of
joy
within
the
clear
moonbeam
the
youth
in
his
new
happiness
a
prince
of
kingdoms
is
the
maiden
is
a
being
fair
as
from
some
other
clime
and
heaven
itself
is
upon
earth
in
that
pure
binding
kiss
there
in
her
garden
in
the
the
ditty
i
met
a
runnel
amid
the
meads
in
the
evening
in
the
evening
and
it
did
ramble
rush
and
reeds
in
the
evening
in
the
evening
and
i
did
linger
to
hear
its
song
as
it
did
carelessly
wind
along
in
the
evening
in
the
evening
what
sang
the
runnel
upon
its
way
in
the
evening
in
the
evening
i
listened
long
to
its
happy
lay
in
the
evening
in
the
evening
but
all
my
musing
seemed
but
in
vain
and
all
its
music
awoke
but
pain
in
the
evening
in
the
evening
the
blooming
thornapple
on
its
bank
also
listened
also
listened
and
flags
and
buttercups
dewy
dank
also
listened
also
listened
and
thrushes
nestling
in
did
hush
their
babes
with
its
melodies
and
they
listened
and
they
listened
i
asked
the
violets
on
its
side
in
the
evening
in
the
evening
if
they
its
song
would
to
me
confide
in
the
evening
in
the
evening
and
like
some
children
of
guileless
soul
they
said
lay
is
the
song
of
all
in
the
evening
in
the
ceaseless
longing
to
reach
the
sea
in
the
evening
in
the
evening
the
song
of
life
and
eternity
in
the
evening
in
the
evening
a
lay
of
love
in
the
early
morn
a
lay
of
hope
to
the
lone
and
lorn
in
the
evening
in
the
the
child
and
the
gospel
of
john
she
pored
the
open
page
of
the
gospel
according
to
john
where
the
ruler
did
christ
engage
at
hours
of
the
silent
night
and
sought
for
his
soul
that
light
which
god
sent
forth
through
his
son
but
she
could
not
read
a
word
a
child
of
four
summers
she
not
ever
even
once
had
she
heard
that
story
of
second
birth
nor
asked
like
the
wise
of
the
earth
lord
how
can
these
things
be
her
face
had
the
glory
of
heaven
the
look
of
an
angel
her
eye
i
said
to
her
it
is
given
to
know
for
her
soul
is
one
with
the
soul
of
this
page
of
john
and
the
wisdom
that
comes
from
on
the
birthday
cake
five
little
candles
on
her
birthday
cake
five
little
candles
brightly
burning
we
gaze
on
them
while
memories
awake
of
happy
moments
nevermore
returning
five
little
years
of
childhood
happiness
five
little
years
when
oft
we
played
together
how
often
did
her
love
and
joy
us
bless
when
days
seemed
dark
and
stormy
was
the
weather
the
tiny
lights
are
dying
one
by
one
as
one
by
one
the
years
their
flight
have
taken
i
shed
a
tear
for
that
which
thus
is
gone
and
kiss
the
child
for
whom
the
cake
was
baken
my
goldfish
five
little
goldfish
in
a
vase
my
simple
do
grace
and
oft
when
tired
of
reading
books
i
turn
to
them
my
weary
looks
and
pleasure
find
in
their
quaint
ways
reminding
me
of
ancient
lays
amid
the
deep
on
sparkling
sands
a
gothic
castle
stands
its
gates
and
windows
open
wide
through
which
the
lustrous
carplings
glide
like
in
the
days
of
old
like
mermaids
in
an
age
of
gold
they
hide
beneath
the
dark
green
weed
and
fondly
on
its
frondlets
feed
it
seems
an
island
near
the
shore
where
lorelei
did
sing
of
yore
and
gold
and
green
most
softly
blend
as
then
ere
romance
had
an
end
o
days
of
legendary
lore
of
and
nymphs
galore
when
tired
of
this
prosaic
age
and
weary
of
the
modern
page
i
find
my
golden
fish
suggest
the
dreams
with
which
your
life
was
blest
ii
sometimes
when
in
uphappy
mood
i
on
my
limitations
brood
and
think
how
narrow
the
confines
in
which
the
soul
almost
repines
i
turn
again
just
to
behold
my
finny
friends
of
burnished
gold
how
little
is
their
rounded
sphere
though
rivers
wide
are
rushing
near
how
little
chance
themselves
to
be
in
realm
the
sunny
sea
i
wonder
not
that
mournful
gape
and
rolling
glance
they
seem
to
ape
yet
all
the
pity
i
bestow
is
tearless
since
in
heart
i
know
it
would
be
fatal
for
my
fish
to
leave
the
of
their
dish
for
they
would
be
an
easy
prey
to
larger
ones
in
stream
or
bay
and
then
this
moral
comes
to
me
while
craving
larger
liberty
it
might
be
death
the
bounds
to
break
which
fate
and
duty
round
me
make
so
be
content
and
get
the
best
of
what
perhaps
is
but
a
jest
the
christmas
music
founded
on
a
norwegian
there
lived
in
the
land
of
ole
bull
a
of
old
whose
soul
with
music
was
often
more
full
than
his
violin
ever
told
he
knew
not
the
art
of
clefs
and
notes
such
seemed
but
some
mystic
runes
but
he
heard
the
music
that
richly
floats
in
unwritten
tunes
he
played
for
the
dances
at
many
a
farm
led
many
a
bridal
train
and
everywhere
did
he
naively
charm
the
maid
and
swain
but
sometimes
he
played
in
a
lonely
place
when
no
one
perchance
was
near
and
then
there
was
sadness
in
his
face
in
his
eyes
a
furtive
tear
for
the
strains
which
he
heard
he
could
never
play
though
trying
it
and
forgotten
they
were
from
day
to
day
and
wandered
his
way
no
more
sometimes
in
anger
he
flung
the
thing
which
would
not
obey
his
soul
then
took
it
again
with
its
broken
string
like
a
mother
her
child
from
his
fall
on
a
christmas
eve
he
had
listened
long
to
the
tones
in
the
snowy
air
the
bells
that
sent
forth
their
joyous
song
here
and
there
in
mountain
hollow
or
forest
deep
or
far
the
frozen
fjord
a
thousand
voices
woke
from
their
sleep
to
join
in
the
heavenly
chord
in
the
house
the
christmas
feast
was
spread
and
he
ate
and
drank
as
he
should
there
was
meat
and
pudding
and
raisin
bread
and
the
brew
was
good
they
feasted
well
on
that
holy
eve
and
did
not
forget
a
and
the
fiddler
felt
it
was
good
to
live
for
banished
he
had
all
care
in
his
sleep
that
night
he
seemed
to
see
his
room
full
of
they
danced
about
with
a
wondrous
glee
to
the
tunes
their
fiddler
awoke
such
tunes
as
he
never
had
heard
before
so
soft
so
clear
and
gay
like
silver
ripples
against
a
shore
in
the
morn
of
a
day
he
saw
the
player
his
strings
and
bow
each
touch
of
his
finger
tips
from
which
such
gladness
did
overflow
with
pleasure
of
lips
he
asked
the
elfin
to
teach
him
one
ah
one
from
his
repertoire
which
he
gladly
did
and
when
it
was
done
another
just
for
encore
he
taught
him
three
and
he
taught
him
four
yea
six
while
the
fairies
danced
till
a
tankard
of
beer
fell
to
the
floor
at
which
the
elfin
glanced
and
saw
a
cross
on
its
side
engraved
then
rose
and
run
with
a
cry
the
fairies
following
as
morning
waved
his
rosy
plumes
in
the
sky
the
peasant
awoke
from
his
fairy
dream
sought
his
fiddle
began
to
play
and
strange
enough
as
it
now
may
seem
remembered
tunes
in
the
elfin
way
he
played
them
all
till
the
day
shone
bright
he
played
them
all
till
the
church
bells
rang
to
call
to
mass
among
candle
lights
to
hear
the
story
which
angels
sang
but
neither
mass
nor
the
homily
could
fix
his
mind
on
the
solemn
things
an
absent
look
in
his
face
one
might
see
and
his
fingers
moved
as
on
his
wife
did
see
it
and
almost
wept
and
prayed
that
he
for
sweet
sake
might
be
from
fairies
and
devils
kept
both
when
asleep
or
when
awake
that
christmas
season
for
three
weeks
long
he
played
for
dances
yea
every
night
his
melodies
were
both
sweet
and
strong
and
gave
the
people
such
great
delight
they
said
they
never
before
had
heard
such
music
come
from
a
violin
and
wondereed
much
of
what
things
had
stirred
the
heart
or
where
he
had
been
but
this
he
kept
to
himself
alone
for
often
since
he
the
fairies
saw
list
to
their
music
when
brightly
shone
the
moon
on
greensward
or
snow
and
more
and
more
did
he
learn
their
art
yea
some
did
whisper
he
was
possest
but
he
had
won
every
heart
when
he
was
old
and
was
laid
to
rest
cruel
kitty
kitty
is
playing
on
the
side
of
the
hill
all
in
the
grass
hunting
a
butterfly
o
you
kill
that
beautiful
thing
alas
she
caught
it
and
wounded
its
wings
cruel
of
kitty
to
play
in
this
way
your
friend
on
top
of
the
hill
if
she
were
alive
now
surely
would
say
alas
that
her
voice
should
be
still
that
prattled
of
beautiful
things
in
her
grave
on
the
hill
the
little
one
lies
her
kitten
at
play
in
the
hay
and
looking
thereon
a
heart
cries
with
grief
she
is
pining
away
like
the
wings
to
were
i
an
artist
i
would
paint
thee
thus
tall
lithe
and
slender
like
a
grecian
youth
in
flowing
garb
whose
lines
enhance
the
form
a
face
whose
soul
is
innocence
and
truth
and
eyes
of
dreamy
love
that
blesses
us
with
gladness
like
the
sunlight
after
storm
were
i
a
master
of
sweet
music
i
would
turn
the
rhythm
of
thy
motion
and
thy
voice
and
laughter
into
melody
a
symphony
fit
for
a
royal
band
with
joy
of
waves
and
sigh
with
entrancement
and
pure
ecstasy
but
i
alas
have
nothing
but
a
rhyme
in
which
to
clothe
the
pleasure
of
an
hour
an
hour
amid
the
fields
and
on
the
stream
i
picked
for
thee
the
rarest
sweetest
flower
a
wild
rose
mingling
odor
with
the
thyme
since
that
seems
truest
of
a
dream
farewell
farewell
dear
lass
it
grieves
me
much
that
thou
must
leave
us
here
alone
thou
our
summer
months
a
touch
of
happiness
as
seldom
known
thou
gavest
such
a
sunny
cheer
that
every
day
seemed
like
a
play
and
now
when
winds
blow
drear
thou
needs
must
go
so
far
away
the
leaves
lie
yellow
on
the
lawn
the
blackbirds
gather
into
flocks
the
thrush
and
lark
have
long
since
gone
the
crows
sit
cawing
on
the
rocks
the
heavy
clouds
soar
wild
and
black
across
the
meadows
sear
with
frost
i
stand
alone
beneath
their
wrack
and
feel
that
joy
is
lost
but
i
shall
forget
thy
smile
and
ever
in
my
heart
shall
ring
the
laughter
which
did
beguile
each
brooding
care
to
take
its
wing
thy
winsomeness
which
woke
my
soul
from
dun
dreariness
shall
leave
a
glamour
over
all
and
even
darkness
bless
so
fare
thee
well
my
lass
may
heaven
keep
thee
pure
and
sweet
may
a
shadow
thee
pass
of
harm
or
dark
deceit
and
mayst
thou
from
the
southern
clime
return
when
breezes
blow
when
minstrel
hosts
perceive
time
to
lift
their
wings
and
northward
go
alone
it
is
good
to
be
all
alone
in
the
dark
of
the
night
aye
the
starry
night
when
those
you
love
truest
are
from
you
gone
in
the
far
away
beyond
sound
and
sight
when
the
wind
is
singing
its
sad
strange
song
in
gloomy
high
and
whispers
the
names
for
whom
you
long
and
the
love
for
which
you
sigh
it
is
good
to
be
all
alone
with
soul
the
soul
which
so
seldom
has
chance
to
speak
it
is
good
to
be
freed
from
the
narrow
and
small
to
rise
from
the
vale
to
the
mountain
peak
to
be
guided
by
stargleams
into
a
sphere
where
the
world
does
not
reach
with
its
clamour
and
cry
and
there
in
the
silence
pause
till
you
hear
your
innermost
self
and
the
god
that
is
nigh
lines
on
an
old
songbook
an
old
hymnbook
owned
by
my
and
bearing
the
following
inscription
cenfebam
hafniae
anno
is
a
collection
of
hymns
and
religious
songs
written
by
dorothe
engelbrets
datter
a
poetess
of
considerable
distinction
in
norway
and
denmark
in
the
century
i
faintly
can
remember
still
a
scene
from
childhood
years
a
picture
dim
which
always
will
be
treasured
in
my
heart
until
beyond
the
change
of
good
and
ill
it
glorified
appears
i
saw
through
an
door
an
aged
face
amid
the
sunlight
on
the
floor
uplifted
and
it
seemed
adore
a
heavenly
vision
or
implore
for
mercy
and
for
grace
an
open
book
was
in
her
hand
from
which
she
read
and
sang
i
was
too
young
to
understand
and
yet
i
thought
it
was
most
grand
a
music
from
a
better
land
which
through
her
singing
rang
this
is
the
book
or
part
thereof
an
aged
thumbworn
tome
quaint
hymns
of
penitence
and
love
by
one
whom
heaven
did
endow
with
glory
fit
for
brow
far
in
her
northern
home
i
look
upon
each
yellow
page
each
stain
and
and
see
in
them
my
heritage
my
great
heritage
which
did
her
pious
soul
engage
in
times
remote
and
dark
pearls
and
palaces
i
wandered
down
a
dusty
road
and
spent
myself
to
sheer
fatigue
until
i
fell
beneath
a
load
of
misery
and
intrigue
when
all
at
once
i
saw
a
string
of
lustrous
pearls
close
by
the
way
it
seemed
such
strange
a
hap
and
thing
that
i
believed
my
sense
astray
but
as
i
dared
to
touch
the
gems
and
as
i
felt
their
soft
delight
and
saw
the
coloring
which
hems
the
robe
of
dawn
snowcapped
height
play
in
their
orbs
i
felt
a
thrill
of
pleasure
surging
through
my
soul
and
then
a
peace
so
rare
and
still
upon
my
restless
heart
to
fall
at
length
i
rose
to
journey
on
but
with
a
strength
and
zest
the
burden
gone
i
saw
the
sun
i
felt
that
life
is
the
string
of
pearls
i
treasured
most
and
guarded
it
with
fondest
care
lest
such
a
fount
of
joy
be
lost
lest
doubt
again
should
me
ensnare
i
travelled
long
at
last
i
came
into
a
place
of
palaces
such
as
in
heaven
have
highest
fame
but
which
the
earthbound
covet
less
the
saints
of
old
did
know
them
well
and
gave
their
all
that
they
might
win
admittance
to
the
humblest
cell
and
forgiveness
for
their
sin
each
pearl
became
within
my
hand
a
key
wherewith
the
doors
to
ope
and
angel
guides
did
ready
stand
to
point
to
each
sincerest
hope
and
dazzling
glory
filled
the
halls
to
archéd
roof
the
music
rose
and
art
adorned
the
walls
and
it
all
hung
sweet
repose
the
first
and
nearest
door
i
tried
was
one
a
singer
long
ago
found
when
distressed
with
pain
he
cried
for
healing
streams
to
him
to
flow
then
sang
his
praise
alone
to
him
healeth
all
thy
sicknesses
and
there
i
found
a
truth
now
dim
that
god
with
health
the
sick
can
bless
another
a
pearl
swung
open
widely
to
my
gaze
and
like
the
waves
that
gently
curl
upon
the
sunlit
face
there
came
in
waves
of
harmony
a
thousand
voices
in
this
place
all
promises
of
things
to
be
and
of
his
daily
help
of
grace
as
the
orchestral
melody
by
variations
is
enhanced
so
did
his
words
unto
me
lead
jubilant
i
stood
entranced
unto
me
give
you
rest
my
yoke
is
easy
burden
light
ah
here
i
found
all
that
my
quest
had
sought
in
weariness
and
night
another
pearl
did
ope
the
gate
to
of
the
where
not
a
shadow
of
dark
fate
had
part
in
any
hour
but
truth
and
righteousness
and
love
did
govern
life
and
destiny
the
will
supreme
above
the
ways
of
man
did
all
decree
and
in
this
hour
of
awful
gloom
when
faith
is
wrecked
and
hope
is
low
the
glory
from
this
makes
all
the
aglow
and
shadows
flee
from
vale
and
plain
and
struggling
armies
see
a
gleam
commensurate
with
grief
and
pain
the
truth
of
what
seemed
but
a
dream
my
rosary
has
many
beads
i
need
an
endless
life
to
learn
to
what
exalted
things
each
leads
for
which
my
soul
doth
truly
yearn
and
when
the
innermost
i
gain
there
hangs
a
cross
which
lights
the
way
to
where
i
fain
would
be
this
moment
and
for
aye
victor
hugo
it
was
on
a
midsummer
night
now
long
ago
in
the
land
of
norway
i
sat
in
an
open
window
and
dreamed
the
valley
and
hills
and
distant
mountains
were
all
like
a
dream
in
the
soft
light
and
wonderful
calm
of
the
night
the
odor
of
and
birch
and
the
mingled
perfume
from
meadows
and
hills
and
vale
wrought
with
a
dreams
and
thrills
of
the
soul
the
lazy
smoke
of
the
saint
fire
like
pillars
rose
from
the
wooded
heights
to
the
sky
cerulian
where
the
evening
star
shone
bright
like
an
eye
that
twinkles
with
tears
of
joy
it
shimmered
above
a
cataract
whose
music
rose
and
fell
where
the
river
leaped
over
the
rocks
to
the
fjord
the
night
had
voices
laughter
and
singing
of
youth
round
the
bonfires
purling
of
streams
and
twitter
of
sleepless
birds
yet
all
was
peace
and
joy
and
life
and
mystery
such
as
the
avon
bard
did
see
and
hear
on
a
midsummer
night
i
was
but
a
boy
and
the
names
of
the
great
were
new
to
me
and
yet
not
strange
i
knew
not
why
that
day
i
had
read
about
hugo
that
he
the
greatest
of
singers
in
our
own
day
was
dead
i
felt
a
sorrow
and
wept
as
over
a
friend
it
seemed
that
his
spirit
was
there
in
the
dreams
of
that
saint
night
that
all
the
fairies
and
flowers
and
streams
were
greeting
him
with
a
love
that
had
sadness
and
yet
which
rose
on
the
wings
of
gladness
up
to
the
stars
my
soul
did
feel
it
i
know
not
how
that
he
was
there
a
part
of
it
all
the
highpriest
of
nature
romance
and
life
to
a
friend
in
the
stillness
of
the
evening
when
the
dew
is
on
the
grass
and
the
forest
stands
the
moonlit
lake
of
glass
do
i
hear
a
sighing
whisper
as
when
happy
lovers
part
it
is
thine
i
hear
my
lady
rising
from
all
heart
when
the
autumn
winds
are
blowing
and
the
yellow
leaves
fall
down
whirled
upon
the
river
flowing
to
the
mighty
distant
sound
then
i
hear
thy
soul
for
the
love
that
is
no
more
for
the
life
now
in
keeping
on
a
unknown
shore
when
the
fields
and
hills
are
covered
with
a
blanket
of
pure
snow
and
the
streams
where
oft
we
hovered
unseen
the
thick
ice
flow
then
i
know
thy
life
lies
hidden
under
wintry
plaid
but
the
hope
which
seems
forbidden
in
its
course
can
not
be
staid
when
in
spring
new
life
is
risen
from
the
grave
with
songs
of
joy
then
thy
soul
shall
leave
its
prison
and
its
broken
harp
employ
then
again
that
sighing
whisper
charged
with
love
and
happiness
i
shall
hear
amid
the
woodlands
which
the
dreamy
lake
caress
to
a
this
sturdy
world
is
hard
to
knock
though
hit
it
as
you
may
it
moves
unmindful
of
the
shock
in
its
accustomed
way
it
laughs
a
little
cynic
laugh
and
says
into
line
the
use
of
rod
and
staff
is
but
for
the
divine
son
or
thou
must
surely
die
one
fool
the
more
or
less
will
not
provoke
a
mournful
cry
nor
cause
an
distress
know
thy
best
be
like
the
rest
and
stop
thy
foolish
knocking
who
cares
for
and
for
save
one
the
quest
of
a
vision
i
had
a
vision
of
the
thing
which
we
call
life
the
sum
of
human
life
in
person
of
an
upright
decked
in
a
robe
of
many
hues
whose
front
was
squares
of
yellow
red
and
green
and
blue
and
purple
and
the
violet
whose
back
was
sombre
brown
but
mostly
black
his
large
and
bony
feet
strode
heavily
upon
beings
in
his
path
on
men
and
women
and
on
little
babes
and
crushed
them
in
the
dust
without
a
pity
once
in
a
while
he
lifted
to
his
breast
some
one
with
fondling
pleasure
and
did
bear
the
favorite
aloft
that
all
might
see
his
contrast
to
their
misery
but
then
at
length
he
tired
of
even
such
and
cast
them
down
into
the
common
dust
i
looked
upon
his
visage
strangest
this
a
blending
of
the
human
and
the
beast
but
then
the
vision
vanished
and
i
heard
a
cry
and
circling
of
the
pheonix
bird
signs
celestial
i
read
in
the
mystic
kabbala
that
there
is
a
creature
in
heaven
to
which
the
most
blessed
jehovah
two
wonderful
tokens
hath
given
a
word
in
its
forehead
at
morning
a
word
in
its
forehead
at
night
like
jewels
those
words
are
adorning
the
creature
with
glory
and
light
the
first
one
is
which
is
telling
the
angels
of
heaven
it
is
day
its
lustre
most
joyous
compelling
is
guiding
and
keeping
their
way
the
other
is
which
betoken
that
night
is
advancing
apace
with
rays
that
are
dimmer
and
broken
like
sunset
through
silvery
haze
and
i
pondered
this
much
till
i
ventured
the
signs
on
this
world
to
apply
though
rabbins
of
old
might
have
censured
and
judged
that
for
this
i
must
die
but
the
sign
that
is
set
on
this
creature
the
world
i
perceive
is
the
last
the
first
may
belong
to
the
future
when
gloomy
vigils
are
past
despair
hence
vain
illusive
hope
thou
errant
guide
thou
jesting
mocking
fool
for
thee
should
be
the
rope
or
drowning
in
the
deepest
pool
or
everlasting
prison
in
the
darkest
pit
of
hell
where
like
a
siren
thou
sit
and
mock
thyself
by
saying
all
is
well
i
henceforth
choose
black
aid
the
only
prophetess
of
real
truth
who
nothing
promises
who
never
made
a
fair
illusion
for
aspiring
youth
is
nothing
she
doth
whisper
still
a
whisper
from
a
cave
it
seems
a
soothing
balm
for
every
human
ill
a
true
solution
of
checkered
dreams
thou
sable
sovereign
of
destiny
thou
queen
of
night
and
grave
thou
ruler
of
woe
and
misery
the
great
cry
which
like
a
wave
breaks
on
the
rocks
of
cruel
fate
thou
autocrat
of
all
that
overwhelms
soul
with
sorrow
disappointment
hate
to
thee
belongs
at
last
all
worlds
and
realms
hope
when
mid
the
ruins
of
my
life
i
sit
dejected
and
forlorn
and
think
how
useless
was
the
strife
that
was
by
strong
ambitions
borne
and
count
the
years
and
reck
the
cost
which
all
seem
idly
spent
and
vain
fair
hope
comes
saying
is
lost
failures
bring
the
better
gain
when
sorrow
troubles
come
in
flocks
like
angry
clouds
driven
by
the
blast
like
waves
against
the
riven
rocks
on
which
my
helpless
soul
is
cast
and
night
and
darkness
come
apace
with
not
a
friend
around
to
cheer
again
she
shows
her
angel
face
and
whispers
gently
not
when
by
the
graves
of
those
i
love
dark
doubts
are
hovering
around
she
lifts
my
tearful
look
above
the
withered
lily
on
the
mound
and
in
the
blue
so
far
away
i
see
a
gleam
it
seems
a
smile
again
i
hear
her
softly
say
not
wait
a
little
o
blessed
hope
without
whose
aid
no
victory
is
ever
won
in
sweet
morn
and
sunny
glade
or
evening
shadows
drear
and
dun
thou
art
our
guardian
angel
who
walks
with
us
when
all
others
fail
and
scatters
roses
fresh
with
dew
o
all
hail
all
hail
be
still
my
soul
be
still
be
still
my
soul
be
still
fret
not
thyself
with
cares
of
life
with
worldly
vanity
and
strife
which
bring
but
ill
withdraw
thyself
and
be
alone
alone
in
holy
solitude
then
shalt
thou
know
the
highest
good
and
for
thy
sins
atone
then
shalt
thou
know
the
harmony
of
sweet
celestial
strains
whose
soothing
notes
allay
the
pains
brought
on
by
human
misery
this
world
is
void
of
peace
nowhere
found
except
within
when
from
the
earthly
gain
to
win
thou
deignest
cease
awake
the
livelong
night
i
lie
awake
while
all
the
world
is
slumbering
and
weary
i
am
numbering
the
hours
which
on
the
stillness
break
the
hours
which
give
to
others
balm
the
blessed
balm
of
soothing
sleep
my
mind
in
cruel
torture
keep
and
yet
demand
a
perfect
calm
the
hours
whose
loss
i
oft
bewail
at
close
of
busy
workingday
now
gladly
i
hear
pass
away
and
the
approaching
morning
hail
and
yet
their
woe
hath
recompense
which
sleeping
mortals
do
not
know
for
gentle
voices
come
and
go
with
solace
to
the
weary
sense
from
distant
meadows
comes
the
sound
of
cowbells
stirred
at
intervals
and
to
my
heart
with
joy
recalls
the
age
when
in
their
clang
i
found
suggestions
of
a
fairy
land
when
elfins
rang
their
silver
bells
in
meads
and
shady
dells
or
on
the
quiet
moonlit
strand
i
hear
the
autumn
song
the
ceaseless
music
of
the
night
it
tells
about
the
flight
and
of
its
life
so
full
and
strong
of
memories
with
love
aglow
in
youth
and
fuller
life
of
vanished
days
with
glory
rife
whose
joys
i
again
shall
know
and
far
away
the
river
sings
its
lullaby
out
to
the
sea
a
sense
of
rest
comes
over
me
perhaps
sweet
sleep
at
last
it
brings
the
awakening
some
morn
i
shall
awake
and
find
dreams
are
ended
and
find
its
fears
and
hopes
have
into
meaning
blended
and
from
the
gloom
of
night
the
day
at
last
ascended
to
find
that
storms
and
waves
have
into
calm
subsided
my
broken
bark
has
into
harbor
glided
and
find
the
compass
true
in
which
my
soul
confided
asters
a
bunch
of
fresh
asters
purple
and
white
and
red
stands
on
my
table
fixed
in
a
mexican
bowl
thanks
i
did
render
for
food
which
my
body
has
fed
but
not
for
the
blossoms
that
gladdened
and
nourished
my
soul
the
joy
they
awake
may
be
truer
thanksgiving
though
wordless
accepted
by
him
who
did
say
by
the
bread
alone
shall
not
be
living
and
bid
us
behold
the
fair
lilies
that
grow
by
the
way
butterflies
i
sit
on
my
porch
the
long
and
dream
and
dream
and
dream
and
the
butterflies
hover
across
the
lawn
in
shadow
and
golden
beam
from
flower
to
flower
they
flutter
and
fly
the
sweet
of
their
beauty
to
find
and
out
of
my
dream
i
wake
with
a
cry
thus
is
my
unquiet
mind
for
the
chalice
of
life
has
few
sweets
for
me
but
mostly
some
bitter
thing
the
flowers
which
i
planted
with
youthful
glee
so
often
their
poison
bring
and
the
dreams
that
i
dream
are
of
things
that
are
past
with
remorse
for
their
follies
and
hopes
that
the
few
joys
of
life
so
briefly
do
last
and
the
so
rapidly
slopes
yet
the
butterflies
dance
for
a
time
without
care
and
why
should
i
murmur
and
fret
while
the
summer
is
here
and
all
nature
is
fair
and
gleams
mid
the
shadows
are
set
banish
remorse
and
the
sorrow
which
slays
and
dance
with
the
butterflies
gay
and
dream
little
less
and
enter
the
ways
of
things
which
remain
for
a
day
the
rosebush
against
a
quivering
golden
beam
where
dance
a
myriad
winged
things
a
rosebush
stands
entranced
in
a
dream
while
one
gay
thrush
in
the
sings
it
sends
from
wealth
of
a
perfume
sweet
an
offering
up
to
the
happy
bard
whose
flood
of
melody
flows
to
meet
the
floating
essence
of
nard
the
flush
of
pink
amid
shades
of
green
is
like
a
wreath
for
a
bride
its
crown
is
decked
with
a
lustrous
sheen
yet
it
has
gloom
where
the
fairies
hide
for
this
is
perfect
eve
when
minds
are
roving
on
wing
when
hearts
are
young
and
all
things
believe
and
gladness
from
long
since
bring
a
rare
creation
a
gift
divine
this
rosebush
is
in
my
garden
nook
whose
beauty
all
of
the
sacred
nine
would
fancy
more
than
the
wisest
book
for
not
a
poet
in
any
age
did
joyful
loveliness
express
like
that
which
lolls
round
the
unseen
mage
so
perfect
charming
and
effortless
it
stands
apart
from
the
world
of
woe
an
yet
has
balm
for
the
troubled
mind
an
holy
altar
where
one
may
know
the
joy
of
beauty
and
solace
find
since
god
is
there
as
in
days
of
eld
when
moses
heard
him
flaming
thorn
for
i
have
always
in
secret
held
that
bush
had
also
its
roses
borne
from
crowds
pretentious
and
gibbering
i
turn
oppressed
to
this
holy
place
instead
of
clamor
the
thrushes
sing
instead
of
crudeness
the
perfect
grace
my
soul
is
free
as
i
bend
to
kiss
the
smiling
rose
whose
enchanting
breath
fills
all
my
being
with
such
a
bliss
that
i
could
wish
it
the
sting
of
death
two
aspects
a
golden
light
on
one
side
of
the
tree
on
the
other
there
is
a
shadow
the
shadowy
side
goes
out
to
me
the
other
runs
down
to
the
meadow
and
the
light
is
beckoning
me
away
to
the
leas
and
fields
of
hay
beckoning
out
from
the
shadow
a
shadowyness
on
one
side
of
the
tree
on
the
other
a
golden
light
and
the
shadowy
side
is
inviting
me
to
rest
in
its
sweet
delight
for
the
porches
are
wide
and
the
ladies
are
fair
and
the
heat
of
the
sun
is
not
striking
there
and
i
stand
at
the
tree
in
a
plight
the
great
thou
art
and
there
is
nought
besides
thee
myriad
errors
in
thought
and
striving
seen
and
unseen
are
not
of
thee
they
are
not
but
since
thou
alone
art
truth
and
love
what
is
of
finiteness
is
nothing
in
thy
everlastingness
he
only
is
that
only
is
which
is
a
part
of
thee
in
mind
or
matter
the
death
chant
i
heard
a
chant
and
a
wailing
among
the
wooded
hills
from
an
indian
hut
where
they
carried
away
a
man
from
his
earthly
ills
the
women
were
chanting
the
weirdest
song
i
have
heard
an
indian
lamentation
till
nature
itself
seemed
stirred
and
my
heart
was
filled
with
pity
as
i
saw
that
band
forlorn
its
poverty
and
sorrow
on
that
bright
september
morn
and
i
thought
of
their
ancient
story
when
the
country
was
all
their
own
and
they
dwelt
its
unshorn
glory
a
splendor
to
us
unknown
the
glory
of
forest
and
prairie
with
herds
and
game
and
the
rivers
and
streams
and
glittering
lakes
for
food
but
another
name
when
they
were
lords
of
the
realms
they
surveyed
and
lived
to
their
content
till
the
white
man
came
and
robbed
them
of
all
but
their
rotting
tent
and
the
chiefs
sat
down
in
the
ashes
mid
the
of
the
past
and
a
race
of
pride
and
adventure
stood
round
with
eyes
downcast
and
the
songs
of
the
chase
and
the
battle
and
the
ballads
of
joy
were
hushed
but
the
is
still
remembered
by
hearts
that
are
sad
and
crushed
and
it
seemed
like
the
wail
of
a
people
whose
sun
upon
earth
has
set
the
chant
of
the
weeping
women
and
the
men
to
burial
met
the
letter
i
wrote
a
letter
from
my
heart
aglow
with
pain
and
passion
in
angry
words
and
sudden
start
of
pity
and
compassion
the
thing
was
done
in
utmost
haste
the
pen
inclined
to
caper
i
count
it
now
an
awful
waste
of
rather
decent
paper
and
when
the
thing
i
had
achieved
was
folded
in
my
pocket
my
soul
felt
wondrously
relieved
spent
like
a
fiery
rocket
when
i
did
think
of
sending
it
i
made
a
vague
decision
that
it
should
wait
a
little
bit
ere
going
on
its
mission
it
waited
one
it
waited
two
and
three
days
for
the
mailing
and
on
the
fourth
myself
did
go
where
it
was
sure
of
failing
upon
our
journey
did
we
cross
a
stream
of
gentle
flowing
where
i
impulsively
did
toss
against
the
breezes
blowing
the
letter
torn
to
smithereens
like
snowflakes
slow
descending
received
by
lambent
hyalines
and
current
gaily
wending
thus
on
the
peaceful
breast
my
words
of
pain
were
carried
some
swiftly
with
the
unrest
and
some
did
longer
tarry
and
to
the
sea
may
be
they
sailed
where
ocean
swells
are
moaning
where
great
agony
is
wailed
mid
endless
groaning
though
nought
is
lost
yet
it
is
well
to
let
the
fiery
letter
find
such
a
fate
for
it
will
quell
things
that
destroy
the
better
and
this
advice
i
freely
give
write
down
your
frowning
for
three
days
let
it
lonely
live
then
kill
it
all
by
drowning
the
poet
is
no
liar
no
though
truth
may
not
be
told
by
him
just
so
and
so
by
weight
and
measure
or
the
cold
and
soulless
numbers
by
facts
so
called
that
cloy
and
cumber
the
psyche
in
its
flight
into
that
heavenly
light
of
things
which
children
know
and
poets
see
and
feel
in
beauty
which
is
truth
whose
glow
sometimes
doth
steal
upon
him
as
does
love
upon
the
youth
and
moves
his
heart
to
song
the
music
of
his
being
whose
notes
are
pure
and
strong
while
he
is
seeing
seraphims
and
all
the
earth
replete
with
glory
and
hears
the
call
from
ages
hoary
to
his
own
day
and
times
to
be
the
voice
of
god
he
despite
the
rod
of
proud
custodians
of
labelled
sans
poetry
before
whom
he
refuses
to
bend
knee
he
because
to
him
was
given
the
vision
to
behold
the
of
heaven
in
little
things
and
great
in
life
and
death
and
destiny
and
fate
the
death
of
the
poet
suggested
by
composition
dying
checkered
dream
is
over
ended
its
joys
and
woes
silent
the
bard
and
the
lover
down
to
the
valley
goes
down
to
the
dark
broad
river
wanders
his
restless
soul
into
the
vast
forever
which
he
so
oft
heard
call
ever
forever
singing
through
each
and
all
over
him
spirits
hover
spirits
who
knew
his
life
knew
all
that
holy
power
wasted
in
grief
and
strife
knew
how
he
gave
not
heeding
sordidness
greed
and
sin
knew
how
his
heart
was
bleeding
only
the
true
to
win
ever
forever
living
within
music
too
vast
for
language
bursting
the
bonds
and
bounds
now
shall
be
free
from
anguish
free
from
discordant
sounds
finding
what
here
it
never
reached
in
its
noblest
fight
the
cadence
of
forever
the
glory
of
deathless
light
ever
forever
leading
him
through
the
night
pale
now
the
brow
of
the
singer
undecked
by
only
a
few
friends
linger
to
whom
he
his
songs
bequeathed
but
a
host
is
waiting
yonder
whose
praise
on
his
ears
doth
burst
and
the
soul
who
does
lonely
wander
shall
quench
its
immortal
thirst
ever
forever
and
the
things
that
are
last
shall
be
first
in
search
of
the
perfect
the
snow
was
new
and
soft
and
deep
the
forest
far
away
from
me
and
yet
how
could
i
christmas
keep
without
a
perfect
christmas
tree
so
i
set
out
a
boy
of
twelve
with
sled
in
hand
to
reach
the
pines
and
through
the
snow
made
for
myself
a
track
amid
most
wild
confines
beneath
the
lofty
trees
there
stood
full
many
a
little
evergreen
and
all
were
straight
and
seemed
quite
good
but
not
a
perfect
one
was
seen
i
waded
on
from
tree
to
tree
and
thought
at
times
my
choice
found
but
lo
it
lacked
true
symmetry
true
symmetry
from
top
to
ground
and
thus
the
afternoon
was
spent
until
the
fell
my
axe
at
last
was
deftly
sent
into
a
spruce
each
stroke
did
tell
its
fate
through
all
the
silent
wood
on
echoes
distant
echoes
near
which
seemed
to
say
in
mocking
mood
perfect
one
is
here
is
here
my
ardor
for
the
perfect
one
subsided
as
i
strapped
my
prize
half
of
my
strength
was
also
gone
and
easy
was
the
compromise
my
basking
in
the
snow
had
drenched
me
and
brought
on
a
chill
the
homeward
journey
long
and
slow
sent
me
to
bed
severely
long
was
i
racked
with
fire
my
life
was
like
a
light
they
thought
its
last
gleam
would
expire
amid
the
storm
of
new
night
thus
did
i
almost
pay
full
score
for
that
my
first
and
youthful
quest
for
perfectness
and
evermore
found
this
is
her
stern
behest
who
would
find
me
must
give
his
all
and
even
then
may
sorely
fail
but
it
adds
glory
to
the
soul
to
walk
in
the
trail
the
christmas
cactus
born
on
the
sandy
plain
born
among
thorns
and
heat
and
pain
brought
to
my
home
amid
cold
and
snow
unfolding
blossoms
of
glory
telling
in
symbol
the
story
and
the
way
that
he
still
must
go
for
tokens
of
joy
in
a
world
of
woe
sorrow
and
loneliness
often
grow
the
word
of
truth
and
the
clear
strain
that
warms
the
heart
when
the
earth
is
frozen
the
lord
of
life
has
nourished
and
chosen
in
deserts
of
thorns
and
pain
but
the
beauty
and
joy
of
my
cactus
flower
has
sweetest
meaning
at
that
great
hour
when
the
ring
on
christmas
eve
then
its
crimson
seems
with
a
wonder
glowing
and
from
its
petals
a
love
is
flowing
which
none
but
christ
can
give
christmas
night
night
and
a
lonely
star
night
with
its
deep
repose
a
gleam
of
light
from
afar
to
souls
oppressed
with
woes
light
of
the
on
the
inn
and
the
that
breaks
the
golden
bar
whence
the
floats
song
of
peace
upon
earth
peace
which
to
heaven
has
fled
but
shall
find
its
second
birth
where
the
blood
of
millions
is
shed
and
good
will
to
men
verily
his
voice
bidding
us
trust
again
yea
even
in
hope
to
rejoice
let
us
follow
the
guiding
ray
let
us
go
to
the
manger
and
see
the
things
which
the
angel
did
say
the
things
that
must
surely
be
and
our
doubts
and
our
fears
shall
cease
as
we
enter
the
holy
place
where
dwelleth
the
prince
of
peace
the
of
love
and
grace
like
children
we
there
will
bend
ourselves
in
true
adoration
and
humbly
in
worship
blend
with
every
people
and
nation
and
sing
with
the
unseen
choir
saviour
to
us
is
born
till
kindles
the
heavenly
fire
in
our
hearts
on
christmas
morn
a
new
invocation
lord
in
this
hour
of
tempest
dread
be
thou
our
stay
while
boisterous
billows
lift
their
head
upon
our
way
while
angry
clouds
the
sun
obscure
be
thou
our
light
and
give
us
courage
to
endure
the
night
deliver
us
from
fear
and
wish
for
pleasure
help
us
defend
what
is
most
dear
with
full
measure
the
liberty
our
fathers
won
through
storm
and
bloody
fray
the
liberty
of
washington
of
lincoln
and
of
clay
grant
us
to
guard
this
heritage
for
all
mankind
that
when
the
world
shall
cease
to
rage
it
here
may
find
the
gift
of
heaven
beyond
all
price
to
show
the
way
that
through
this
awful
sacrifice
may
dawn
a
better
day
we
know
not
what
the
year
will
bring
of
loss
and
sorrow
but
help
us
thou
in
faith
to
sing
of
every
morrow
as
that
of
hope
and
victory
and
larger
meed
with
trust
that
thou
wilt
ever
be
our
help
in
need
thus
we
will
breast
the
darkest
storm
since
not
alone
and
confident
thou
wilt
perform
at
last
enthrone
thy
righteous
acts
among
all
men
and
tyrants
overthrow
grant
that
this
recording
pen
such
victories
may
know

many
a

who
weeps
within
the

our
souls
have
need
of
easter
its
lily
pure
and
sweet
as
when
the
kissed
her
before
the
feet
our
souls
have
need
of
easter
with

which
breaks
the
base
and
bister

of
the
pharisee
our
souls
have
need
of
easter
with
faith

glad
and
strong

be
the
firm
resister
of

and

crumbling

reigned
five

a

revived
until
its
brightness
clears
the
gloom
of
history
thanks
to
the
toil
of
sages
who
are
following
its
gleam
into
the
hoary
past
and
there
the
oil
of
wisdom
find
which
turns
the
agelong
dream

he
looks
upon
the
daily
passing
throng
as
in
his
day
he
gazed
upon
the
world
with
cynic
smile
while
it
did
pass
along
with
standards
of
its
varied
creeds
unfurled
upon
his
forehead
citadel
his
searching
thoughts
have
left
their
runic
stamp
the
meager
hands
and
neck
the
story
tell
how
frail
the
temple
of
his
lamp
in
classic
robe
and
fillet
does
he
sit
the
of
golden
age
by
whom
the
torch
of
liberty
was
lit
in
truth
and
beauty
on
the
written
page
and
work
and
freedom
in
this
sage
did
find
their
true
apostle
to
all
humankind
a
venetian
xv
century
in
the
gothic
room
of
the
minneapolis
art
institute
when
i
behold
these
grooves
cut
in
the
edge
of
istrian
marble
by
the
thy
ancient
history
its
romance
opes
from
zorzi
palace
garden
and
its
hedge
i
see
the
maidens
near
the
ledge
and
plumed
signors
feeding
ardent
hopes
from
glances
darting
thy
watery
slopes
or
hear
the
lovers
whisper
soft
their
pledge
as
deep
and
pure
as
was
thy
cooling
drink
the
fount
of
life
the
elixir
of
youth
the
of
venetian
art
and
song
when
truth
was
beauty
and
all
beauty
truth
even
now
thy
charms
can
make
the
weary
strong
while
pausing
at
thy
side
to
dream
and
think
the
prospect
a
youth
lay
stretched
upon
the
hay
in
woodland
meadow
near
a
winding
stream
and
gazed
at
so
far
away
and
who
can
tell
the
substance
of
his
dream
a
span
of
horses
and
a
rusty
rake
stood
near
him
where
his
father
made
repair
the
ground
was
rough
and
things
did
sometimes
break
and
added
trouble
to
the
care
at
last
the
rake
was
fixed
the
boy
arose
to
take
his
place
upon
its
and
doing
so
he
said
you
suppose
that
i
can
go
away
this
fall
to
school
to
which
his
father
answered
will
see
if
you
work
hard
till
snow
flies
it
may
the
harvest
the
perfect
all
resplendent
moon
looks
down
from
cloudless
realms
of
blue
upon
a
scene
most
marvellous
earth
in
her
a
golden
garment
hemmed
by
darkish
green
moved
by
the
wandering
winds
that
drink
the
sweet
of
and
tasselled
corn
the
sound
thereof
is
as
when
lovers
meet
and
whisper
gladness
out
of
hearts
her
royal
robe
to
which
the
world
is
clinging
on
which
the
moon
and
sun
smile
with
delight
of
which
all
minstrels
now
are
singing
in
varied
melodies
by
day
and
night
great
achievement
loveliest
and
best
the
golden
harvest
of
the
middle
west
the
reward
of
epimenides
when
solon
gave
to
athens
laws
and
sought
to
cleanse
it
from
pollutions
and
the
crimes
which
dire
disasters
from
the
gods
had
brought
he
called
a
prophet
from
the
purer
clime
of
sunny
crete
great
epimenides
the
wise
the
whose
long
sleep
had
let
him
into
mysteries
and
things
that
are
for
common
minds
too
deep
he
came
and
did
the
work
of
bard
and
priest
that
code
might
shine
clear
as
the
sun
and
what
reward
the
people
hardly
wist
but
offered
riches
for
the
service
done
olive
branch
is
all
i
ask
he
said
that
branch
is
green
though
dead
