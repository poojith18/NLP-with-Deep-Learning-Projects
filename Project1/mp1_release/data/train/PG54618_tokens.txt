extract

introduction
to
the
first
english
edition
i
can
lay
no
claim
to
having
discovered
an
america
but
i
do
claim
to
have
discovered
a
columbus
his
name
is
benedetto
croce
and
he
dwells
on
the
shores
of
the
mediterranean
at
naples
city
of
the
antique
parthenope
it
was
at
naples
in
the
winter
of
that
i
first
saw
the
philosopher
of
æsthetic
benedetto
croce
although
born
in
the
abruzzi
province
of
aquila
is
essentially
a
neapolitan
and
rarely
remains
long
absent
from
the
city
on
the
shore
of
that
magical
sea
where
once
ulysses
sailed
and
where
sometimes
yet
near
amalfi
we
may
hear
the
syrens
sing
their
song
but
more
wonderful
than
the
song
of
any
syren
seems
to
me
the
theory
of
æsthetic
as
the
science
of
expression
and
that
is
why
i
have
overcome
the
obstacles
that
stood
between
me
and
the
giving
of
this
theory
which
in
my
belief
is
the
truth
to
the
world
the
solution
of
the
problem
of
æsthetic
is
not
in
the
gift
of
the
muses
this
philosophy
of
the
spirit
is
symptomatic
of
the
happy
reaction
of
the
twentieth
century
against
the
crude
materialism
of
the
second
half
of
the
nineteenth
it
is
the
spirit
which
gives
to
the
work
of
art
its
value
not
this
or
that
method
of
arrangement
this
or
that
tint
or
cadence
which
can
always
be
copied
by
skilful
plagiarists
not
so
the
of
the
creator
in
england
we
hear
too
much
of
natural
science
which
has
usurped
the
very
name
of
philosophy
the
natural
sciences
are
very
well
in
their
place
but
discoveries
such
as
aviation
are
of
infinitely
less
importance
to
the
race
than
the
smallest
addition
to
the
philosophy
of
the
spirit
empirical
science
with
the
collusion
of
positivism
has
stolen
the
cloak
of
philosophy
and
must
be
made
to
give
it
back
yet
though
severe
the
editor
of
is
uncompromisingly
just
and
would
never
allow
personal
dislike
or
jealousy
or
any
extrinsic
consideration
to
stand
in
the
way
of
fair
treatment
to
the
writer
concerned
many
superficial
english
critics
might
benefit
considerably
by
attention
to
this
quality
in
one
who
is
in
other
respects
also
so
immeasurably
their
superior
a
good
instance
of
this
impartiality
is
his
critique
of
schopenhauer
with
whose
system
he
is
in
complete
disagreement
yet
affords
him
full
credit
for
what
of
truth
is
contained
in
his
voluminous
writings
this
thoroughness
it
is
which
gives
such
importance
to
the
literary
and
philosophical
criticisms
of
croce
method
is
always
historical
and
his
object
in
approaching
any
work
of
art
is
to
classify
the
spirit
of
its
author
as
expressed
in
that
work
there
are
he
maintains
but
two
things
to
be
considered
in
criticizing
a
book
these
are
what
is
its
in
what
way
is
it
singular
how
is
it
differentiated
from
other
works
what
is
its
degree
of
that
is
to
what
extent
has
its
author
kept
himself
free
from
all
considerations
alien
to
the
perfection
of
the
work
as
an
expression
as
a
lyrical
intuition
with
the
answering
of
these
questions
croce
is
satisfied
he
does
not
care
to
know
if
the
author
keep
a
like
mæterlinck
or
prefer
to
walk
on
putney
heath
like
swinburne
this
amounts
to
saying
that
all
works
of
art
must
be
judged
by
their
own
standard
how
far
has
the
author
succeeded
in
doing
what
he
intended
as
regards
croce
general
philosophical
position
it
is
important
to
understand
that
he
is
a
hegelian
in
the
sense
of
being
a
close
follower
of
that
philosopher
one
of
his
last
works
is
that
in
which
he
deals
in
a
masterly
manner
with
the
philosophy
of
hegel
the
title
may
be
translated
what
is
living
and
what
is
dead
of
the
philosophy
of
hegel
here
he
explains
to
us
the
hegelian
system
more
clearly
than
that
wondrous
edifice
was
ever
before
explained
and
we
realize
at
the
same
time
that
croce
is
quite
as
independent
of
hegel
as
of
kant
of
vico
as
of
spinoza
of
course
he
has
made
use
of
the
best
of
hegel
just
as
every
thinker
makes
use
of
his
predecessors
and
is
in
his
turn
made
use
of
by
those
that
follow
him
but
it
is
incorrect
to
accuse
of
hegelianism
the
author
of
an
of
a
where
hegel
is
only
half
accepted
and
of
a
of
the
which
contains
hardly
a
trace
of
hegel
i
give
an
instance
if
the
great
conquest
of
hegel
be
the
dialectic
of
opposites
his
great
mistake
lies
in
the
confusion
of
opposites
with
things
which
are
distinct
but
not
opposite
if
says
croce
we
take
as
an
example
the
application
of
the
hegelian
triad
that
formulates
becoming
affirmation
negation
and
synthesis
we
find
it
applicable
for
those
opposites
which
are
true
and
false
good
and
evil
being
and
but
to
things
which
are
distinct
but
not
opposite
such
as
art
and
philosophy
beauty
and
truth
the
useful
and
the
moral
these
confusions
led
hegel
to
talk
of
the
death
of
art
to
conceive
as
possible
a
philosophy
of
history
and
to
the
application
of
the
natural
sciences
to
the
absurd
task
of
constructing
a
philosophy
of
nature
croce
has
cleared
away
these
difficulties
by
showing
that
if
from
the
meeting
of
opposites
must
arise
a
superior
synthesis
such
a
synthesis
can
not
arise
from
things
which
are
distinct
not
opposite
since
the
former
are
connected
together
as
superior
and
inferior
and
the
inferior
can
exist
without
the
superior
but
vice
thus
we
see
how
philosophy
can
not
exist
without
art
while
art
occupying
the
lower
place
can
and
does
exist
without
philosophy
this
brief
example
reveals
croce
independence
in
dealing
with
hegelian
problems
i
know
of
no
philosopher
more
generous
than
croce
in
praise
and
elucidation
of
other
workers
in
the
same
field
past
and
present
for
instance
and
apart
from
hegel
has
to
thank
him
for
drawing
attention
to
the
marvellous
excellence
of
the
of
judgment
generally
neglected
in
favour
of
the
critiques
of
reason
and
of
practical
for
drawing
the
attention
of
the
world
to
his
obscure
name
and
for
reprinting
his
latin
thesis
in
which
the
word
occurs
for
the
first
time
and
for
the
tributes
paid
to
his
neglected
genius
in
the
history
of
æsthetic
critica
too
is
full
of
generous
appreciation
of
contemporaries
by
croce
and
by
that
profound
thinker
gentile
there
can
be
no
doubt
of
the
great
value
of
croce
work
as
an
influence
and
if
we
are
to
judge
of
a
philosophical
system
by
its
action
on
others
then
we
must
place
the
of
the
very
high
it
may
be
said
with
perfect
truth
that
since
the
death
of
the
poet
carducci
there
has
been
no
influence
in
italy
to
compare
with
that
of
benedetto
croce
of
the
popularity
that
his
system
and
teaching
have
already
attained
we
may
judge
by
the
fact
that
the
despite
the
difficulty
of
the
subject
is
already
in
its
third
edition
in
italy
where
owing
to
its
influence
philosophy
sells
better
than
fiction
while
the
french
and
germans
not
to
mention
the
czechs
have
long
had
translations
of
the
earlier
editions
his
is
on
the
point
of
appearing
in
its
second
edition
and
i
have
no
doubt
that
the
of
the
will
eventually
equal
these
works
in
popularity
importance
and
value
of
italian
thought
have
been
too
long
neglected
in
great
where
as
in
benedetto
croce
we
get
the
clarity
of
vision
of
the
latin
joined
to
the
thoroughness
and
erudition
of
the
best
german
tradition
we
have
a
combination
of
rare
power
and
effectiveness
which
can
by
no
means
be
neglected
the
philosopher
feels
that
he
has
a
great
mission
which
is
nothing
less
than
the
leading
back
of
thought
to
belief
in
the
spirit
deserted
by
so
many
for
crude
empiricism
and
positivism
his
view
of
philosophy
is
that
it
sums
up
all
the
higher
human
activities
including
religion
and
that
in
proper
hands
it
is
able
to
solve
any
problem
but
there
is
no
finality
about
problems
the
solution
of
one
leads
to
the
posing
of
another
and
so
on
man
is
the
maker
of
life
and
his
spirit
ever
proceeds
from
a
lower
to
a
higher
perfection
i
believe
that
croce
will
one
day
be
recognized
as
one
of
the
very
few
great
teachers
of
humanity
at
present
he
is
not
appreciated
at
nearly
his
full
value
one
rises
from
a
study
of
his
philosophy
with
a
sense
of
having
been
all
the
time
as
it
were
in
personal
touch
with
the
truth
which
is
very
far
from
the
case
after
the
perusal
of
certain
other
philosophies
secure
in
his
strength
croce
will
often
introduce
a
joke
or
some
amusing
illustration
from
contemporary
life
in
the
midst
of
a
most
profound
and
serious
argument
this
spirit
of
mirth
is
a
sign
of
superiority
he
who
is
not
sure
of
himself
can
spare
no
energy
for
the
making
of
mirth
croce
loves
to
laugh
at
his
enemies
and
with
his
friends
so
the
philosopher
of
naples
sits
by
the
blue
gulf
and
explains
the
universe
to
those
who
have
ears
to
hear
one
can
philosophize
anywhere
he
says
but
he
remains
significantly
at
naples
thus
i
conclude
these
brief
remarks
upon
the
author
of
the
confident
that
those
who
give
time
and
attention
to
its
study
will
be
grateful
for
having
placed
in
their
hands
this
pearl
of
great
price

edition
this
second
edition
of
the
will
be
found
to
contain
the
complete
translation
of
the
historical
portion
which
i
was
obliged
to
summarize
in
the
first
edition
i
have
made
a
number
of
alterations
and
some
additions
to
the
theoretical
portion
following
closely
the
fourth
definitive
italian
edition
and
in
so
doing
have
received
much
advice
and
assistance
of
value
from
salusbury
to
whom
i
beg
to
tender
my
best
thanks
i
trust
that
this
new
edition
will
enable
all
those
desirous
of
studying
the
work
to
get
into
direct
touch
with
the
thought
of
the
author
the
athenæum
pall
mall
author
preface
this
volume
is
composed
of
a
theoretical
and
of
a
historical
part
which
form
two
independent
but
complementary
books
the
nucleus
of
the
theoretical
part
is
a
memoir
bearing
the
title
theses
of
an
æsthetic
as
science
of
expression
and
general
linguistic
which
was
read
at
the
accademia
pontaniana
of
naples
during
the
sessions
of
february
and
may
and
printed
in
vol
xxx
of
its
the
author
has
added
few
substantial
variations
but
not
a
few
additions
and
amplifications
in
rewriting
it
also
following
a
somewhat
different
sequence
with
a
view
to
rendering
the
exposition
more
plain
and
easy
the
first
five
chapters
only
of
the
historical
portion
were
inserted
in
the
neapolitan
review
april
under
the
title
vico
first
discoverer
of
æsthetic
science
and
these
also
reappear
amplified
and
brought
into
harmony
with
the
rest
the
author
has
dwelt
especially
in
the
theoretical
part
upon
general
questions
which
are
in
respect
to
the
theme
that
he
has
treated
but
this
will
not
seem
a
digression
to
those
who
remember
that
strictly
speaking
there
are
no
particular
philosophical
sciences
standing
by
themselves
philosophy
is
unity
and
when
we
treat
of
æsthetic
or
of
logic
or
of
ethics
we
treat
always
of
the
whole
of
philosophy
although
illustrating
for
didactic
purposes
only
one
side
of
that
inseparable
unity
in
like
manner
owing
to
this
intimate
connexion
of
all
the
parts
of
philosophy
the
uncertainty
and
misunderstanding
as
to
the
æsthetic
activity
the
representative
and
productive
imagination
this
firstborn
of
the
spiritual
activities
mainstay
of
the
others
generates
everywhere
else
misunderstandings
uncertainties
and
errors
in
psychology
as
in
logic
in
history
as
in
the
philosophy
of
practice
if
language
is
the
first
spiritual
manifestation
and
if
the
æsthetic
form
is
language
itself
taken
in
all
its
true
scientific
extension
it
is
hopeless
to
try
to
understand
clearly
the
later
and
more
complicated
phases
of
the
life
of
the
spirit
when
their
first
and
simplest
moment
is
ill
known
mutilated
and
disfigured
from
the
explanation
of
the
æsthetic
activity
is
also
to
be
expected
the
correction
of
several
concepts
and
the
solution
of
certain
philosophic
problems
which
generally
seem
to
be
almost
desperate
such
is
precisely
the
spirit
animating
the
present
work
and
if
the
present
attempt
and
the
historical
illustrations
which
accompany
it
may
be
of
use
in
winning
friends
to
these
studies
by
levelling
obstacles
and
indicating
paths
to
be
followed
if
this
happen
especially
here
in
italy
whose
æsthetic
traditions
as
has
been
demonstrated
in
its
place
are
very
noble
the
author
will
consider
that
he
has
gained
his
end
and
one
of
his
keenest
desires
will
have
been
satisfied
naples
in
addition
to
a
careful
literary
revision
in
which
as
well
as
in
the
revision
of
the
notes
i
have
received
valuable
help
from
my
friend
fausto
nicolini
i
have
in
this
third
edition
made
certain
alterations
of
theory
especially
in
chapters
and
xi
of
part
suggested
by
further
reflexion
and
but
i
have
refrained
from
introducing
corrections
or
additions
of
such
a
kind
as
to
alter
the
original
plan
of
the
book
which
was
or
was
meant
to
be
a
complete
but
brief
æsthetic
theory
set
in
the
framework
of
a
general
sketch
of
a
philosophy
of
the
spirit
the
reader
who
desires
a
complete
statement
of
the
general
or
collateral
doctrines
or
a
more
particular
exposition
of
the
other
parts
of
philosophy
the
lyrical
nature
of
art
is
now
referred
to
the
volumes
on
and
the
of
practice
which
together
with
the
present
work
compose
the
of
the
which
in
the
author
opinion
exhausts
the
entire
field
of
philosophy
the
three
volumes
were
not
conceived
and
written
simultaneously
if
they
had
been
some
details
would
have
been
differently
arranged
when
i
wrote
the
first
i
had
no
idea
of
giving
it
as
i
have
now
done
two
such
companions
and
i
therefore
designed
it
to
be
as
i
say
complete
in
itself
in
the
second
place
the
present
state
of
the
study
of
æsthetic
made
it
desirable
to
append
to
the
theoretical
exposition
a
somewhat
full
history
of
the
science
whereas
for
the
other
parts
of
philosophy
i
was
able
to
restrict
myself
to
brief
historical
notes
merely
designed
to
show
how
from
my
point
of
view
such
a
history
would
best
be
composed
lastly
there
are
many
things
which
now
after
a
systematic
exposition
of
the
various
philosophical
sciences
i
see
in
closer
connexions
and
in
a
clearer
or
at
least
a
different
light
a
certain
hesitation
and
even
some
doctrinal
errors
visible
here
and
there
in
the
especially
where
subjects
foreign
to
æsthetic
itself
are
being
treated
would
now
no
longer
be
justified
for
all
these
reasons
the
three
volumes
in
spite
of
their
substantial
unity
of
spirit
and
of
aim
have
each
its

intuition
and

sidenote
knowledge
has
two
forms
it
is
either
knowledge
or
knowledge
knowledge
obtained
through
the
or
knowledge
obtained
through
the
knowledge
of
the
or
knowledge
of
the
of
or
of
the
between
them
it
is
in
fact
productive
either
of
or
of
in
ordinary
life
constant
appeal
is
made
to
intuitive
knowledge
it
is
said
that
we
can
not
give
definitions
of
certain
truths
that
they
are
not
demonstrable
by
syllogisms
that
they
must
be
learnt
intuitively
the
politician
finds
fault
with
the
abstract
reasoner
who
possesses
no
lively
intuition
of
actual
conditions
the
educational
theorist
insists
upon
the
necessity
of
developing
the
intuitive
faculty
in
the
pupil
before
everything
else
the
critic
in
judging
a
work
of
art
makes
it
a
point
of
honour
to
set
aside
theory
and
abstractions
and
to
judge
it
by
direct
intuition
the
practical
man
professes
to
live
rather
by
intuition
than
by
reason
but
this
ample
acknowledgment
granted
to
intuitive
knowledge
in
ordinary
life
does
not
correspond
to
an
equal
and
adequate
acknowledgment
in
the
field
of
theory
and
of
philosophy
there
exists
a
very
ancient
science
of
intellectual
knowledge
admitted
by
all
without
discussion
namely
logic
but
a
science
of
intuitive
knowledge
is
timidly
and
with
difficulty
asserted
by
but
a
few
logical
knowledge
has
appropriated
the
lion
share
and
if
she
does
not
slay
and
devour
her
companion
outright
yet
yields
to
her
but
grudgingly
the
humble
place
of
or
what
can
intuitive
knowledge
be
without
the
light
of
intellectual
knowledge
it
is
a
servant
without
a
master
and
though
a
master
find
a
servant
useful
the
master
is
a
necessity
to
the
servant
since
he
enables
him
to
gain
his
livelihood
intuition
is
blind
intellect
lends
her
eyes
sidenote
independence
with
respect
to
intellectual
now
the
first
point
to
be
firmly
fixed
in
the
mind
is
that
intuitive
knowledge
has
no
need
of
a
master
nor
to
lean
upon
any
one
she
does
not
need
to
borrow
the
eyes
of
others
for
she
has
excellent
eyes
of
her
own
doubtless
it
is
possible
to
find
concepts
mingled
with
intuitions
but
in
many
other
intuitions
there
is
no
trace
of
such
a
mixture
which
proves
that
it
is
not
necessary
the
impression
of
a
moonlight
scene
by
a
painter
the
outline
of
a
country
drawn
by
a
cartographer
a
musical
motive
tender
or
energetic
the
words
of
a
sighing
lyric
or
those
with
which
we
ask
command
and
lament
in
ordinary
life
may
well
all
be
intuitive
facts
without
a
shadow
of
intellectual
relation
but
think
what
one
may
of
these
instances
and
admitting
further
the
contention
that
the
greater
part
of
the
intuitions
of
civilized
man
are
impregnated
with
concepts
there
yet
remains
to
be
observed
something
more
important
and
more
conclusive
those
concepts
which
are
found
mingled
and
fused
with
the
intuitions
are
no
longer
concepts
in
so
far
as
they
are
really
mingled
and
fused
for
they
have
lost
all
independence
and
autonomy
they
have
been
concepts
but
have
now
become
simple
elements
of
intuition
the
philosophical
maxims
placed
in
the
mouth
of
a
personage
of
tragedy
or
of
comedy
perform
there
the
function
not
of
concepts
but
of
characteristics
of
such
personage
in
the
same
way
as
the
red
in
a
painted
face
does
not
there
represent
the
red
colour
of
the
physicists
but
is
a
characteristic
element
of
the
portrait
the
whole
is
that
which
determines
the
quality
of
the
parts
a
work
of
art
may
be
full
of
philosophical
concepts
it
may
contain
them
in
greater
abundance
and
they
may
there
be
even
more
profound
than
in
a
philosophical
dissertation
which
in
its
turn
may
be
rich
to
overflowing
with
descriptions
and
intuitions
but
notwithstanding
all
these
concepts
the
total
effect
of
the
work
of
art
is
an
intuition
and
notwithstanding
all
those
intuitions
the
total
effect
of
the
philosophical
dissertation
is
a
concept
the
contains
copious
ethical
observations
and
distinctions
but
does
not
for
that
reason
lose
as
a
whole
its
character
of
simple
story
or
intuition
in
like
manner
the
anecdotes
and
satirical
effusions
to
be
found
in
the
works
of
a
philosopher
like
schopenhauer
do
not
deprive
those
works
of
their
character
of
intellectual
treatises
the
difference
between
a
scientific
work
and
a
work
of
art
that
is
between
an
intellectual
fact
and
an
intuitive
fact
lies
in
the
difference
of
the
total
effect
aimed
at
by
their
respective
authors
this
it
is
that
determines
and
rules
over
the
several
parts
of
each
not
these
parts
separated
and
considered
abstractly
in
themselves
sidenote
and
but
to
admit
the
independence
of
intuition
as
regards
concept
does
not
suffice
to
give
a
true
and
precise
idea
of
intuition
another
error
arises
among
those
who
recognize
this
or
who
at
any
rate
do
not
explicitly
make
intuition
dependent
upon
the
intellect
to
obscure
and
confuse
the
real
nature
of
intuition
by
intuition
is
frequently
understood
or
the
knowledge
of
actual
reality
the
apprehension
of
something
as
certainly
perception
is
intuition
the
perceptions
of
the
room
in
which
i
am
writing
of
the
and
paper
that
are
before
me
of
the
pen
i
am
using
of
the
objects
that
i
touch
and
make
use
of
as
instruments
of
my
person
which
if
it
write
therefore
exists
these
are
all
intuitions
but
the
image
that
is
now
passing
through
my
brain
of
a
me
writing
in
another
room
in
another
town
with
different
paper
pen
and
ink
is
also
an
intuition
this
means
that
the
distinction
between
reality
and
is
extraneous
secondary
to
the
true
nature
of
intuition
if
we
imagine
a
human
mind
having
intuitions
for
the
first
time
it
would
seem
that
it
could
have
intuitions
of
actual
reality
only
that
is
to
say
that
it
could
have
perceptions
of
nothing
but
the
real
but
since
knowledge
of
reality
is
based
upon
the
distinction
between
real
images
and
unreal
images
and
since
this
distinction
does
not
at
the
first
moment
exist
these
intuitions
would
in
truth
not
be
intuitions
either
of
the
real
or
of
the
unreal
not
perceptions
but
pure
intuitions
where
all
is
real
nothing
is
real
the
child
with
its
difficulty
of
distinguishing
true
from
false
history
from
fable
which
are
all
one
to
childhood
can
furnish
us
with
a
sort
of
very
vague
and
only
remotely
approximate
idea
of
this
ingenuous
state
intuition
is
the
undifferentiated
unity
of
the
perception
of
the
real
and
of
the
simple
image
of
the
possible
in
our
intuitions
we
do
not
oppose
ourselves
as
empirical
beings
to
external
reality
but
we
simply
objectify
our
impressions
whatever
they
be
sidenote
and
the
concepts
of
space
and
those
therefore
who
look
upon
intuition
as
sensation
formed
and
arranged
simply
according
to
the
categories
of
space
and
time
would
seem
to
approximate
more
nearly
to
the
truth
space
and
time
they
say
are
the
forms
of
intuition
to
have
an
intuition
is
to
place
it
in
space
and
in
temporal
sequence
intuitive
activity
would
then
consist
in
this
double
and
concurrent
function
of
spatiality
and
temporality
but
for
these
two
categories
must
be
repeated
what
was
said
of
intellectual
distinctions
when
found
mingled
with
intuitions
we
have
intuitions
without
space
and
without
time
the
colour
of
a
sky
the
colour
of
a
feeling
a
cry
of
pain
and
an
effort
of
will
objectified
in
consciousness
these
are
intuitions
which
we
possess
and
with
their
making
space
and
time
have
nothing
to
do
in
some
intuitions
spatiality
may
be
found
without
temporality
in
others
and
even
where
both
are
found
they
are
perceived
by
later
reflexion
they
can
be
fused
with
the
intuition
in
like
manner
with
all
its
other
elements
that
is
they
are
in
it
and
not
as
ingredients
and
not
as
arrangement
who
without
an
act
of
reflexion
which
for
a
moment
breaks
in
upon
his
contemplation
can
think
of
space
while
looking
at
a
drawing
or
a
view
who
is
conscious
of
temporal
sequence
while
listening
to
a
story
or
a
piece
of
music
without
breaking
into
it
with
a
similar
act
of
reflexion
what
intuition
reveals
in
a
work
of
art
is
not
space
and
time
but
individual
the
view
here
maintained
is
confirmed
in
several
quarters
of
modern
philosophy
space
and
time
far
from
being
simple
and
primitive
functions
are
nowadays
conceived
as
intellectual
constructions
of
great
complexity
and
further
even
in
some
of
those
who
do
not
altogether
deny
to
space
and
time
the
quality
of
formative
principles
categories
and
functions
one
observes
an
effort
to
unite
them
and
to
regard
them
in
a
different
manner
from
that
in
which
these
categories
are
generally
conceived
some
limit
intuition
to
the
sole
category
of
spatiality
maintaining
that
even
time
can
only
be
intuited
in
terms
of
space
others
abandon
the
three
dimensions
of
space
as
not
philosophically
necessary
and
conceive
the
function
of
spatiality
as
void
of
all
particular
spatial
determination
but
what
could
such
a
spatial
function
be
a
simple
arrangement
that
should
arrange
even
time
it
represents
surely
all
that
criticism
and
refutation
have
left
standing
the
bare
demand
for
the
affirmation
of
some
intuitive
activity
in
general
and
is
not
this
activity
truly
determined
when
one
single
function
is
attributed
to
it
not
spatializing
nor
temporalizing
but
characterizing
or
rather
when
it
is
conceived
as
itself
a
category
or
function
which
gives
us
knowledge
of
things
in
their
concreteness
and
individuality
sidenote
and
having
thus
freed
intuitive
knowledge
from
any
suggestion
of
intellectualism
and
from
every
later
and
external
addition
we
must
now
explain
it
and
determine
its
limits
from
another
side
and
defend
it
from
a
different
kind
of
invasion
and
confusion
on
the
hither
side
of
the
lower
limit
is
sensation
formless
matter
which
the
spirit
can
never
apprehend
in
itself
as
simple
matter
this
it
can
only
possess
with
form
and
in
form
but
postulates
the
notion
of
it
as
a
mere
limit
matter
in
its
abstraction
is
mechanism
passivity
it
is
what
the
spirit
of
man
suffers
but
does
not
produce
without
it
no
human
knowledge
or
activity
is
possible
but
mere
matter
produces
animality
whatever
is
brutal
and
impulsive
in
man
not
the
spiritual
dominion
which
is
humanity
how
often
we
strive
to
understand
clearly
what
is
passing
within
us
we
do
catch
a
glimpse
of
something
but
this
does
not
appear
to
the
mind
as
objectified
and
formed
it
is
in
such
moments
as
these
that
we
best
perceive
the
profound
difference
between
matter
and
form
these
are
not
two
acts
of
ours
opposed
to
one
another
but
the
one
is
outside
us
and
assaults
and
sweeps
us
off
our
feet
while
the
other
inside
us
tends
to
absorb
and
identify
itself
with
that
which
is
outside
matter
clothed
and
conquered
by
form
produces
concrete
form
it
is
the
matter
the
content
which
differentiates
one
of
our
intuitions
from
another
the
form
is
constant
it
is
spiritual
activity
while
matter
is
changeable
without
matter
spiritual
activity
would
not
forsake
its
abstractness
to
become
concrete
and
real
activity
this
or
that
spiritual
content
this
or
that
definite
intuition
it
is
a
curious
fact
characteristic
of
our
times
that
this
very
form
this
very
activity
of
the
spirit
which
is
essentially
ourselves
is
so
often
ignored
or
denied
some
confound
the
spiritual
activity
of
man
with
the
metaphorical
and
mythological
activity
of
what
is
called
nature
which
is
mechanism
and
has
no
resemblance
to
human
activity
save
when
we
imagine
with
æsop
that
loquuntur
non
tantum
some
affirm
that
they
have
never
observed
in
themselves
this
miraculous
activity
as
though
there
were
no
difference
or
only
one
of
quantity
between
sweating
and
thinking
feeling
cold
and
the
energy
of
the
will
others
certainly
with
greater
reason
would
unify
activity
and
mechanism
in
a
more
general
concept
though
they
are
specifically
distinct
let
us
however
refrain
for
the
moment
from
examining
if
such
a
final
unification
be
possible
and
in
what
sense
but
admitting
that
the
attempt
may
be
made
it
is
clear
that
to
unify
two
concepts
in
a
third
implies
to
begin
with
the
admission
of
a
difference
between
the
two
first
here
it
is
this
difference
that
concerns
us
and
we
set
it
in
relief
sidenote
and
intuition
has
sometimes
been
confused
with
simple
sensation
but
since
this
confusion
ends
by
being
offensive
to
common
sense
it
has
more
frequently
been
attenuated
or
concealed
with
a
phraseology
apparently
designed
at
once
to
confuse
and
to
distinguish
them
thus
it
has
been
asserted
that
intuition
is
sensation
but
not
so
much
simple
sensation
as
of
sensations
here
a
double
meaning
is
concealed
in
the
word
association
association
is
understood
either
as
memory
mnemonic
association
conscious
recollection
and
in
that
case
the
claim
to
unite
in
memory
elements
which
are
not
intuited
distinguished
possessed
in
some
way
by
the
spirit
and
produced
by
consciousness
seems
inconceivable
or
it
is
understood
as
association
of
unconscious
elements
in
which
case
we
remain
in
the
world
of
sensation
and
of
nature
but
if
with
certain
associationists
we
speak
of
an
association
which
is
neither
memory
nor
flux
of
sensations
but
a
association
formative
constructive
distinguishing
then
our
contention
is
admitted
and
only
its
name
is
denied
to
it
for
productive
association
is
no
longer
association
in
the
sense
of
the
sensationalists
but
that
is
to
say
spiritual
activity
synthesis
may
be
called
association
but
with
the
concept
of
productivity
is
already
posited
the
distinction
between
passivity
and
activity
between
sensation
and
intuition
sidenote
and
other
psychologists
are
disposed
to
distinguish
from
sensation
something
which
is
sensation
no
longer
but
is
not
yet
intellectual
concept
the
or
what
is
the
difference
between
their
representation
or
image
and
our
intuitive
knowledge
everything
and
nothing
for
representation
is
a
very
equivocal
word
if
by
representation
be
understood
something
cut
off
and
standing
out
from
the
psychic
basis
of
the
sensations
then
representation
is
intuition
if
on
the
other
hand
it
be
conceived
as
complex
sensation
we
are
back
once
more
in
crude
sensation
which
does
not
vary
in
quality
according
to
its
richness
or
poverty
or
according
to
whether
the
organism
in
which
it
appears
is
rudimentary
or
highly
developed
and
full
of
traces
of
past
sensations
nor
is
the
ambiguity
remedied
by
defining
representation
as
a
psychic
product
of
secondary
degree
in
relation
to
sensation
defined
as
occupying
the
first
place
what
does
secondary
degree
mean
here
does
it
mean
a
qualitative
formal
difference
if
so
representation
is
an
elaboration
of
sensation
and
therefore
intuition
or
does
it
mean
greater
complexity
and
complication
a
quantitative
material
difference
in
that
case
intuition
is
once
more
confused
with
simple
sensation
sidenote
and
and
yet
there
is
a
sure
method
of
distinguishing
true
intuition
true
representation
from
that
which
is
inferior
to
it
the
spiritual
fact
from
the
mechanical
passive
natural
fact
every
true
intuition
or
representation
is
also
that
which
does
not
objectify
itself
in
expression
is
not
intuition
or
representation
but
sensation
and
mere
natural
fact
the
spirit
only
intuites
in
making
forming
expressing
he
who
separates
intuition
from
expression
never
succeeds
in
reuniting
them
intuitive
activity
intuitions
to
the
extent
that
it
expresses
should
this
proposition
sound
paradoxical
that
is
partly
because
as
a
general
rule
a
too
restricted
meaning
is
given
to
the
word
expression
it
is
generally
restricted
to
what
are
called
verbal
expressions
alone
but
there
exist
also
expressions
such
as
those
of
line
colour
and
sound
and
to
all
of
these
must
be
extended
our
affirmation
which
embraces
therefore
every
sort
of
manifestation
of
the
man
as
orator
musician
painter
or
anything
else
but
be
it
pictorial
or
verbal
or
musical
or
in
whatever
other
form
it
appear
to
no
intuition
can
expression
in
one
of
its
forms
be
wanting
it
is
in
fact
an
inseparable
part
of
intuition
how
can
we
really
possess
an
intuition
of
a
geometrical
figure
unless
we
possess
so
accurate
an
image
of
it
as
to
be
able
to
trace
it
immediately
upon
paper
or
on
the
blackboard
how
can
we
really
have
an
intuition
of
the
contour
of
a
region
for
example
of
the
island
of
sicily
if
we
are
not
able
to
draw
it
as
it
is
in
all
its
meanderings
every
one
can
experience
the
internal
illumination
which
follows
upon
his
success
in
formulating
to
himself
his
impressions
and
feelings
but
only
so
far
as
he
is
able
to
formulate
them
feelings
or
impressions
then
pass
by
means
of
words
from
the
obscure
region
of
the
soul
into
the
clarity
of
the
contemplative
spirit
it
is
impossible
to
distinguish
intuition
from
expression
in
this
cognitive
process
the
one
appears
with
the
other
at
the
same
instant
because
they
are
not
two
but
one
sidenote
as
to
their
the
principal
reason
which
makes
our
view
appear
paradoxical
as
we
maintain
it
is
the
illusion
or
prejudice
that
we
possess
a
more
complete
intuition
of
reality
than
we
really
do
one
often
hears
people
say
that
they
have
many
great
thoughts
in
their
minds
but
that
they
are
not
able
to
express
them
but
if
they
really
had
them
they
would
have
coined
them
into
just
so
many
beautiful
sounding
words
and
thus
have
expressed
them
if
these
thoughts
seem
to
vanish
or
to
become
few
and
meagre
in
the
act
of
expressing
them
the
reason
is
that
they
did
not
exist
or
really
were
few
and
meagre
people
think
that
all
of
us
ordinary
men
imagine
and
intuite
countries
figures
and
scenes
like
painters
and
bodies
like
sculptors
save
that
painters
and
sculptors
know
how
to
paint
and
carve
such
images
while
we
bear
them
unexpressed
in
our
souls
they
believe
that
any
one
could
have
imagined
a
madonna
of
raphæl
but
that
raphæl
was
raphæl
owing
to
his
technical
ability
in
putting
the
madonna
upon
canvas
nothing
can
be
more
false
than
this
view
the
world
which
as
a
rule
we
intuite
is
a
small
thing
it
consists
of
little
expressions
which
gradually
become
greater
and
wider
with
the
increasing
spiritual
concentration
of
certain
moments
they
are
the
words
we
say
to
ourselves
our
silent
judgments
here
is
a
man
here
is
a
horse
this
is
heavy
this
is
sharp
this
pleases
me
etc
it
is
a
medley
of
light
and
colour
with
no
greater
pictorial
value
than
would
be
expressed
by
a
haphazard
splash
of
colours
from
among
which
one
could
barely
make
out
a
few
special
distinctive
traits
this
and
nothing
else
is
what
we
possess
in
our
ordinary
life
this
is
the
basis
of
our
ordinary
action
it
is
the
index
of
a
book
the
labels
tied
to
things
it
has
been
said
take
the
place
of
the
things
themselves
this
index
and
these
labels
themselves
expressions
suffice
for
small
needs
and
small
actions
from
time
to
time
we
pass
from
the
index
to
the
book
from
the
label
to
the
thing
or
from
the
slight
to
the
greater
intuitions
and
from
these
to
the
greatest
and
most
lofty
this
passage
is
sometimes
far
from
easy
it
has
been
observed
by
those
who
have
best
studied
the
psychology
of
artists
that
when
after
having
given
a
rapid
glance
at
any
one
they
attempt
to
obtain
a
real
intuition
of
him
in
order
for
example
to
paint
his
portrait
then
this
ordinary
vision
that
seemed
so
precise
so
lively
reveals
itself
as
little
better
than
nothing
what
remains
is
found
to
be
at
the
most
some
superficial
trait
which
would
not
even
suffice
for
a
caricature
the
person
to
be
painted
stands
before
the
artist
like
a
world
to
discover
michæl
angelo
said
one
paints
not
with
the
hands
but
with
the
brain
leonardo
shocked
the
prior
of
the
convent
of
the
graces
by
standing
for
days
together
gazing
at
the
last
supper
without
touching
it
with
the
brush
he
remarked
of
this
attitude
the
minds
of
men
of
lofty
genius
are
most
active
in
invention
when
they
are
doing
the
least
external
work
the
painter
is
a
painter
because
he
sees
what
others
only
feel
or
catch
a
glimpse
of
but
do
not
see
we
think
we
see
a
smile
but
in
reality
we
have
only
a
vague
impression
of
it
we
do
not
perceive
all
the
characteristic
traits
of
which
it
is
the
sum
as
the
painter
discovers
them
after
he
has
worked
upon
them
and
is
thus
able
to
fix
them
on
the
canvas
we
do
not
intuitively
possess
more
even
of
our
intimate
friend
who
is
with
us
every
day
and
at
all
hours
than
at
most
certain
traits
of
physiognomy
which
enable
us
to
distinguish
him
from
others
the
illusion
is
less
easy
as
regards
musical
expression
because
it
would
seem
strange
to
every
one
to
say
that
the
composer
had
added
or
attached
notes
to
a
motive
which
was
already
in
the
mind
of
him
who
is
not
the
composer
as
if
beethoven
ninth
symphony
were
not
his
own
intuition
and
his
intuition
the
ninth
symphony
now
just
as
one
who
is
deluded
as
to
the
amount
of
his
material
wealth
is
confuted
by
arithmetic
which
states
its
exact
amount
so
he
who
nourishes
delusions
as
to
the
wealth
of
his
own
thoughts
and
images
is
brought
back
to
reality
when
he
is
obliged
to
cross
the
of
expression
let
us
say
to
the
former
count
to
the
latter
speak
or
here
is
a
pencil
draw
express
yourself
each
of
us
as
a
matter
of
fact
has
in
him
a
little
of
the
poet
of
the
sculptor
of
the
musician
of
the
painter
of
the
prose
writer
but
how
little
as
compared
with
those
who
bear
those
names
just
because
they
possess
the
most
universal
dispositions
and
energies
of
human
nature
in
so
lofty
a
degree
how
little
too
does
a
painter
possess
of
the
intuitions
of
a
poet
and
how
little
does
one
painter
possess
those
of
another
painter
nevertheless
that
little
is
all
our
actual
patrimony
of
intuitions
or
representations
beyond
these
are
only
impressions
sensations
feelings
impulses
emotions
or
whatever
else
one
may
term
what
still
falls
short
of
the
spirit
and
is
not
assimilated
by
man
something
postulated
for
the
convenience
of
exposition
while
actually
since
to
exist
also
is
a
fact
of
the
spirit
sidenote
of
intuition
and
we
may
thus
add
this
to
the
various
verbal
descriptions
of
intuition
noted
at
the
beginning
intuitive
knowledge
is
expressive
knowledge
independent
and
autonomous
in
respect
to
intellectual
function
indifferent
to
later
empirical
discriminations
to
reality
and
to
unreality
to
formations
and
apperceptions
of
space
and
time
which
are
also
later
intuition
or
representation
is
distinguished
as
from
what
is
felt
and
suffered
from
the
flux
or
wave
of
sensation
or
from
psychic
matter
and
this
form
this
taking
possession
is
expression
to
intuite
is
to
express
and
nothing
else
nothing
more
but
nothing
less
than
ii
intuition
and
art
sidenote
and
before
proceeding
further
it
may
be
well
to
draw
certain
consequences
from
what
has
been
established
and
to
add
some
explanations
sidenote
of
art
and
intuitive
we
have
frankly
identified
intuitive
or
expressive
knowledge
with
the
æsthetic
or
artistic
fact
taking
works
of
art
as
examples
of
intuitive
knowledge
and
attributing
to
them
the
characteristics
of
intuition
and
but
our
identification
is
combated
by
a
view
held
even
by
many
philosophers
who
consider
art
to
be
an
intuition
of
an
altogether
special
sort
let
us
admit
they
say
that
art
is
intuition
but
intuition
is
not
always
art
artistic
intuition
is
a
distinct
species
differing
from
intuition
in
general
by
something
sidenote
specific
but
no
one
has
ever
been
able
to
indicate
of
what
this
something
more
consists
it
has
sometimes
been
thought
that
art
is
not
a
simple
intuition
but
an
intuition
of
an
intuition
in
the
same
way
as
the
concept
of
science
has
been
defined
not
as
the
ordinary
concept
but
as
the
concept
of
a
concept
thus
man
would
attain
to
art
by
objectifying
not
his
sensations
as
happens
with
ordinary
intuition
but
intuition
itself
but
this
process
of
raising
to
a
second
power
does
not
exist
and
the
comparison
of
it
with
the
ordinary
and
scientific
concept
does
not
prove
what
is
intended
for
the
good
reason
that
it
is
not
true
that
the
scientific
concept
is
the
concept
of
a
concept
if
this
comparison
proves
anything
it
proves
just
the
opposite
the
ordinary
concept
if
it
be
really
a
concept
and
not
a
simple
representation
is
a
perfect
concept
however
poor
and
limited
science
substitutes
concepts
for
representations
for
those
concepts
that
are
poor
and
limited
it
substitutes
others
larger
and
more
comprehensive
it
is
ever
discovering
new
relations
but
its
method
does
not
differ
from
that
by
which
is
formed
the
smallest
universal
in
the
brain
of
the
humblest
of
men
what
is
generally
called
art
collects
intuitions
that
are
wider
and
more
complex
than
those
which
we
generally
experience
but
these
intuitions
are
always
of
sensations
and
impressions
art
is
expression
of
impressions
not
expression
of
expression
sidenote
difference
of
for
the
same
reason
it
can
not
be
asserted
that
the
intuition
which
is
generally
called
artistic
differs
from
ordinary
intuition
as
intensive
intuition
this
would
be
the
case
if
it
were
to
operate
differently
on
the
same
matter
but
since
the
artistic
function
is
extended
to
wider
fields
yet
does
not
differ
in
method
from
ordinary
intuition
the
difference
between
them
is
not
intensive
but
extensive
the
intuition
of
the
simplest
popular
which
says
the
same
thing
or
very
nearly
as
any
declaration
of
love
that
issues
at
every
moment
from
the
lips
of
thousands
of
ordinary
men
may
be
intensively
perfect
in
its
poor
simplicity
although
it
be
extensively
so
much
more
limited
than
the
complex
intuition
of
a
by
leopardi
sidenote
difference
is
extensive
and
the
whole
difference
then
is
quantitative
and
as
such
is
indifferent
to
philosophy
certain
men
have
a
greater
aptitude
a
more
frequent
inclination
fully
to
express
certain
complex
states
of
the
soul
these
men
are
known
in
ordinary
language
as
artists
some
very
complicated
and
difficult
expressions
are
not
often
achieved
and
these
are
called
works
of
art
the
limits
of
the
that
are
called
art
as
opposed
to
those
that
are
vulgarly
called
are
empirical
and
impossible
to
define
if
an
epigram
be
art
why
not
a
simple
word
if
a
story
why
not
the
of
the
journalist
if
a
landscape
why
not
a
topographical
sketch
the
teacher
of
philosophy
in
molière
comedy
was
right
whenever
we
speak
we
create
prose
but
there
will
always
be
scholars
like
monsieur
jourdain
astonished
at
having
spoken
prose
for
forty
years
without
knowing
it
who
will
have
difficulty
in
persuading
themselves
that
when
they
call
their
servant
john
to
bring
their
slippers
they
have
spoken
nothing
less
than
prose
we
must
hold
firmly
to
our
identification
because
among
the
principal
reasons
which
have
prevented
æsthetic
the
science
of
art
from
revealing
the
true
nature
of
art
its
real
roots
in
human
nature
has
been
its
separation
from
the
general
spiritual
life
the
having
made
of
it
a
sort
of
special
function
or
aristocratic
club
no
one
is
astonished
when
he
learns
from
physiology
that
every
cell
is
an
organism
and
every
organism
a
cell
or
synthesis
of
cells
no
one
is
astonished
at
finding
in
a
lofty
mountain
the
same
chemical
elements
that
compose
a
small
stone
fragment
there
is
not
one
physiology
of
small
animals
and
one
of
large
animals
nor
is
there
a
special
chemical
theory
of
stones
as
distinct
from
mountains
in
the
same
way
there
is
not
a
science
of
lesser
intuition
as
distinct
from
a
science
of
greater
intuition
nor
one
of
ordinary
intuition
as
distinct
from
artistic
intuition
there
is
but
one
æsthetic
the
science
of
intuitive
or
expressive
knowledge
which
is
the
æsthetic
or
artistic
fact
and
this
æsthetic
is
the
true
analogue
of
logic
which
includes
as
facts
of
the
same
nature
the
formation
of
the
smallest
and
most
ordinary
concept
and
the
most
complicated
scientific
and
philosophical
system
sidenote
nor
can
we
admit
that
the
word
or
artistic
genius
as
distinct
from
the
of
the
ordinary
man
possesses
more
than
a
quantitative
signification
great
artists
are
said
to
reveal
us
to
ourselves
but
how
could
this
be
possible
unless
there
were
identity
of
nature
between
their
imagination
and
ours
and
unless
the
difference
were
only
one
of
quantity
it
were
better
to
change
into
nascitur
some
men
are
born
great
poets
some
small
the
cult
of
the
genius
with
all
its
attendant
superstitions
has
arisen
from
this
quantitative
difference
having
been
taken
as
a
difference
of
quality
it
has
been
forgotten
that
genius
is
not
something
that
has
fallen
from
heaven
but
humanity
itself
the
man
of
genius
who
poses
or
is
represented
as
remote
from
humanity
finds
his
punishment
in
becoming
or
appearing
somewhat
ridiculous
examples
of
this
are
the
of
the
romantic
period
and
the
of
our
time
but
it
is
well
to
note
here
that
those
who
claim
unconsciousness
as
the
chief
quality
of
an
artistic
genius
hurl
him
from
an
eminence
far
above
humanity
to
a
position
far
below
it
intuitive
or
artistic
genius
like
every
form
of
human
activity
is
always
conscious
otherwise
it
would
be
blind
mechanism
the
only
thing
that
can
be
wanting
to
artistic
genius
is
the
consciousness
the
superadded
consciousness
of
the
historian
or
critic
which
is
not
essential
to
it
sidenote
and
form
in
the
relation
between
matter
and
form
or
between
and
as
is
generally
said
is
one
of
the
most
disputed
questions
in
æsthetic
does
the
æsthetic
fact
consist
of
content
alone
or
of
form
alone
or
of
both
together
this
question
has
taken
on
various
meanings
which
we
shall
mention
each
in
its
place
but
when
these
words
are
taken
as
signifying
what
we
have
above
defined
and
matter
is
understood
as
emotionality
not
æsthetically
elaborated
or
impressions
and
form
as
intellectual
activity
and
expression
then
our
view
can
not
be
in
doubt
we
must
that
is
to
say
reject
both
the
thesis
that
makes
the
æsthetic
fact
to
consist
of
the
content
alone
that
is
the
simple
impressions
and
the
thesis
which
makes
it
to
consist
of
a
junction
between
form
and
content
that
is
of
impressions
plus
expressions
in
the
æsthetic
fact
expressive
activity
is
not
added
to
the
fact
of
the
impressions
but
these
latter
are
formed
and
elaborated
by
it
the
impressions
reappear
as
it
were
in
expression
like
water
put
into
a
filter
which
reappears
the
same
and
yet
different
on
the
other
side
the
æsthetic
fact
therefore
is
form
and
nothing
but
form
from
this
was
inferred
not
that
the
content
is
something
superfluous
it
is
on
the
contrary
the
necessary
point
of
departure
for
the
expressive
fact
but
that
is
no
from
the
qualities
of
the
content
to
those
of
the
form
it
has
sometimes
been
thought
that
the
content
in
order
to
be
æsthetic
that
is
to
say
transformable
into
form
should
possess
some
determined
or
determinable
qualities
but
were
that
so
then
form
and
content
expression
and
impression
would
be
the
same
thing
it
is
true
that
the
content
is
that
which
is
convertible
into
form
but
it
has
no
determinable
qualities
until
this
transformation
takes
place
we
know
nothing
about
it
it
does
not
become
æsthetic
content
before
but
only
after
it
has
been
actually
transformed
the
æsthetic
content
has
also
been
defined
as
the
that
is
not
an
untrue
statement
it
is
merely
void
of
meaning
interesting
to
what
to
the
expressive
activity
certainly
the
expressive
activity
would
not
have
raised
the
content
to
the
dignity
of
form
had
it
not
been
interested
in
it
being
interested
is
precisely
the
raising
of
the
content
to
the
dignity
of
form
but
the
word
interesting
has
also
been
employed
in
another
and
a
illegitimate
sense
which
we
shall
explain
further
on
sidenote
of
the
imitation
of
nature
and
of
the
artistic
the
proposition
that
art
is
of
has
also
several
meanings
sometimes
truths
have
been
expressed
or
at
least
shadowed
forth
in
these
words
sometimes
errors
have
been
promulgated
more
frequently
no
definite
thought
has
been
expressed
at
all
one
of
the
scientifically
legitimate
meanings
occurs
when
imitation
is
understood
as
representation
or
intuition
of
nature
a
form
of
knowledge
and
when
the
phrase
is
used
with
this
intention
and
in
order
to
emphasize
the
spiritual
character
of
the
process
another
proposition
becomes
legitimate
also
namely
that
art
is
the
or
imitation
of
nature
but
if
by
imitation
of
nature
be
understood
that
art
gives
mechanical
reproductions
more
or
less
perfect
duplicates
of
natural
objects
in
the
presence
of
which
is
renewed
the
same
tumult
of
impressions
as
that
caused
by
natural
objects
then
the
proposition
is
evidently
false
the
coloured
waxen
effigies
that
imitate
the
life
before
which
we
stand
astonished
in
the
museums
where
such
things
are
shown
do
not
give
æsthetic
intuitions
illusion
and
hallucination
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
calm
domain
of
artistic
intuition
but
on
the
other
hand
if
an
artist
paint
the
interior
of
a
museum
or
if
an
actor
give
a
burlesque
portrait
of
a
on
the
stage
we
have
work
of
the
spirit
and
artistic
intuition
finally
if
photography
have
in
it
anything
artistic
it
will
be
to
the
extent
that
it
transmits
the
intuition
of
the
photographer
his
point
of
view
the
pose
and
grouping
which
he
has
striven
to
attain
and
if
photography
be
not
quite
an
art
that
is
precisely
because
the
element
of
nature
in
it
remains
more
or
less
unconquered
and
ineradicable
do
we
ever
indeed
feel
complete
satisfaction
before
even
the
best
of
photographs
would
not
an
artist
vary
and
touch
up
much
or
little
remove
or
add
something
to
all
of
them
sidenote
of
art
conceived
as
a
fact
of
feeling
not
a
theoretical
fact
æsthetic
appearance
and
the
statements
repeated
so
often
that
art
is
not
knowledge
that
it
does
not
tell
the
truth
that
it
does
not
belong
to
the
world
of
theory
but
to
the
world
of
feeling
and
so
forth
arise
from
the
failure
to
realize
exactly
the
theoretic
character
of
simple
intuition
this
simple
intuition
is
quite
distinct
from
intellectual
knowledge
as
it
is
distinct
from
perception
of
the
real
and
the
statements
quoted
above
arise
from
the
belief
that
only
intellectual
cognition
is
knowledge
we
have
seen
that
intuition
is
knowledge
free
from
concepts
and
more
simple
than
the
perception
of
the
real
therefore
art
is
knowledge
form
it
does
not
belong
to
the
world
of
feeling
or
to
psychic
matter
the
reason
why
so
many
æstheticians
have
so
often
insisted
that
art
is
is
precisely
that
they
have
felt
the
necessity
of
distinguishing
it
from
the
more
complex
fact
of
perception
by
maintaining
its
pure
intuitiveness
and
if
for
the
same
reason
it
has
been
claimed
that
art
is
the
reason
is
the
same
for
if
the
concept
as
content
of
art
and
historical
reality
as
such
be
excluded
from
the
sphere
of
art
there
remains
no
other
content
than
reality
apprehended
in
all
its
ingenuousness
and
immediacy
in
the
vital
impulse
in
its
that
is
to
say
again
pure
intuition
sidenote
of
the
theory
of
æsthetic
the
theory
of
the
has
also
arisen
from
the
failure
to
establish
or
from
having
lost
to
view
the
character
of
expression
as
distinct
from
impression
of
form
as
distinct
from
matter
this
theory
can
be
reduced
to
the
error
just
indicated
of
wishing
to
find
a
passage
from
the
qualities
of
the
content
to
those
of
the
form
to
ask
in
fact
what
the
æsthetic
senses
are
implies
asking
what
sensible
impressions
are
able
to
enter
into
æsthetic
expressions
and
which
must
of
necessity
do
so
to
this
we
must
at
once
reply
that
all
impressions
can
enter
into
æsthetic
expressions
or
formations
but
that
none
are
bound
to
do
so
of
necessity
dante
raised
to
the
dignity
of
form
not
only
the
sweet
colour
of
the
oriental
sapphire
visual
impressions
but
also
tactual
or
thermic
impressions
such
as
the
dense
air
and
the
fresh
rivulets
which
parch
the
more
the
throat
of
the
thirsty
the
belief
that
a
picture
yields
only
visual
impressions
is
a
curious
illusion
the
bloom
on
a
cheek
the
warmth
of
a
youthful
body
the
sweetness
and
freshness
of
a
fruit
the
edge
of
a
sharp
knife
are
not
these
too
impressions
obtainable
from
a
picture
are
they
visual
what
would
a
picture
mean
to
an
imaginary
man
lacking
all
or
many
of
his
senses
who
should
in
an
instant
acquire
the
organ
of
sight
alone
the
picture
we
are
looking
at
and
believe
we
see
only
with
our
eyes
would
seem
to
his
eyes
to
be
little
more
than
an
palette
some
who
hold
firmly
to
the
æsthetic
character
of
certain
groups
of
impressions
for
example
the
visual
and
auditive
and
exclude
others
are
nevertheless
ready
to
admit
that
if
visual
and
auditive
impressions
enter
into
the
æsthetic
fact
those
of
the
other
senses
also
enter
into
it
but
only
as
but
this
distinction
is
altogether
arbitrary
æsthetic
expression
is
synthesis
in
which
it
is
impossible
to
distinguish
direct
and
indirect
all
impressions
are
placed
by
it
on
a
level
in
so
far
as
they
are
æstheticized
a
man
who
absorbs
the
subject
of
a
picture
or
poem
does
not
have
it
before
him
as
a
series
of
impressions
some
of
which
have
prerogatives
and
precedence
over
the
others
he
knows
nothing
as
to
what
has
happened
prior
to
having
absorbed
it
just
as
on
the
other
hand
distinctions
made
after
reflexion
have
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
art
as
such
the
theory
of
the
æsthetic
senses
has
also
been
presented
in
another
way
as
an
attempt
to
establish
what
physiological
organs
are
necessary
for
the
æsthetic
fact
the
physiological
organ
or
apparatus
is
nothing
but
a
group
of
cells
constituted
and
disposed
in
a
particular
manner
that
is
to
say
it
is
a
merely
physical
and
natural
fact
or
concept
but
expression
does
not
know
physiological
facts
expression
has
its
point
of
departure
in
the
impressions
and
the
physiological
path
by
which
these
have
found
their
way
to
the
mind
is
to
it
altogether
indifferent
one
way
or
another
comes
to
the
same
thing
it
suffices
that
they
should
be
impressions
it
is
true
that
the
want
of
given
organs
that
is
of
certain
groups
of
cells
prevents
the
formation
of
certain
impressions
when
these
are
not
otherwise
obtained
through
a
kind
of
organic
compensation
the
man
born
blind
can
not
intuite
and
express
light
but
the
impressions
are
not
conditioned
solely
by
the
organ
but
also
by
the
stimuli
which
operate
upon
the
organ
one
who
has
never
had
the
impression
of
the
sea
will
never
be
able
to
express
it
in
the
same
way
as
one
who
has
never
had
the
impression
of
the
life
of
high
society
or
of
the
political
arena
will
never
express
either
this
however
does
not
prove
the
dependence
of
the
expressive
function
on
the
stimulus
or
on
the
organ
it
merely
repeats
what
we
know
already
expression
presupposes
impression
and
particular
expressions
particular
impressions
for
the
rest
every
impression
excludes
other
impressions
during
the
moment
in
which
it
dominates
and
so
does
every
expression
sidenote
and
indivisibility
of
the
work
of
another
corollary
of
the
conception
of
expression
as
activity
is
the
of
the
work
of
art
every
expression
is
a
single
expression
activity
is
a
fusion
of
the
impressions
in
an
organic
whole
a
desire
to
express
this
has
always
prompted
the
affirmation
that
the
work
of
art
should
have
or
what
amounts
to
the
same
thing
in
expression
is
a
synthesis
of
the
various
or
multiple
in
the
one
the
fact
that
we
divide
a
work
of
art
into
parts
a
poem
into
scenes
episodes
similes
sentences
or
a
picture
into
single
figures
and
objects
background
foreground
may
seem
opposed
to
this
affirmation
but
such
division
annihilates
the
work
as
dividing
the
organism
into
heart
brain
nerves
muscles
and
so
on
turns
the
living
being
into
a
corpse
it
is
true
that
there
exist
organisms
in
which
division
gives
rise
to
other
living
beings
but
in
such
a
case
we
must
conclude
maintaining
the
analogy
between
the
organism
and
the
work
of
art
that
in
the
latter
case
too
there
are
numerous
germs
of
life
each
ready
to
grow
in
a
moment
into
a
single
complete
expression
it
may
be
said
that
expression
sometimes
arises
from
other
expressions
there
are
simple
and
there
are
expressions
one
must
surely
admit
some
difference
between
the
with
which
archimedes
expressed
all
his
joy
at
his
discovery
and
the
expressive
act
indeed
all
the
five
acts
of
a
regular
not
in
the
least
expression
always
arises
directly
from
impressions
he
who
conceives
a
tragedy
puts
into
a
crucible
a
great
quantity
so
to
say
of
impressions
expressions
themselves
conceived
on
other
occasions
are
fused
together
with
the
new
in
a
single
mass
in
the
same
way
as
we
can
cast
into
a
melting
furnace
formless
pieces
of
bronze
and
choicest
statuettes
those
choicest
statuettes
must
be
melted
just
like
the
pieces
of
bronze
before
there
can
be
a
new
statue
the
old
expressions
must
descend
again
to
the
level
of
impressions
in
order
to
be
synthesized
in
a
new
single
expression
sidenote
as
by
elaborating
his
impressions
man
himself
from
them
by
objectifying
them
he
removes
them
from
him
and
makes
himself
their
superior
the
liberating
and
purifying
function
of
art
is
another
aspect
and
another
formula
of
its
character
as
activity
activity
is
the
deliverer
just
because
it
drives
away
passivity
this
also
explains
why
it
is
usual
to
attribute
to
artists
both
the
maximum
of
sensibility
or
and
the
maximum
of
insensibility
or
olympian
the
two
characters
are
compatible
for
they
do
not
refer
to
the
same
object
the
sensibility
or
passion
relates
to
the
rich
material
which
the
artist
absorbs
into
his
psychic
organism
the
insensibility
or
serenity
to
the
form
with
which
he
subdues
and
dominates
the
tumult
of
the
sensations
and
passions
iii
art
and
philosophy
sidenote
of
intellectual
from
intuitive
the
two
forms
of
knowledge
æsthetic
and
intellectual
or
conceptual
are
indeed
different
but
this
does
not
altogether
amount
to
separation
and
disjunction
as
of
two
forces
each
pulling
in
its
own
direction
if
we
have
shown
that
the
æsthetic
form
is
altogether
independent
of
the
intellectual
and
suffices
to
itself
without
external
support
we
have
not
said
that
the
intellectual
can
stand
without
the
æsthetic
to
describe
the
independence
as
would
not
be
true
what
is
knowledge
by
concepts
it
is
knowledge
of
the
relations
of
things
and
things
are
intuitions
concepts
are
not
possible
without
intuitions
just
as
intuition
is
itself
impossible
without
the
matter
of
impressions
intuitions
are
this
river
this
lake
this
brook
this
rain
this
glass
of
water
the
concept
is
water
not
this
or
that
appearance
and
particular
example
of
water
but
water
in
general
in
whatever
time
or
place
it
be
realized
the
material
of
infinite
intuitions
but
of
one
single
constant
concept
but
the
concept
the
universal
if
it
be
no
longer
intuition
in
one
respect
is
intuition
in
another
respect
and
can
not
fail
of
being
intuition
the
man
who
thinks
has
impressions
and
emotions
in
so
far
as
he
thinks
his
impression
and
emotion
will
be
not
love
or
hate
not
the
passion
of
the
man
who
is
not
a
philosopher
not
hate
or
love
for
certain
objects
and
individuals
but
effort
of
his
thought
itself
with
the
pain
and
the
joy
the
love
and
the
hate
joined
to
it
this
effort
can
not
but
assume
an
intuitive
form
in
becoming
objective
to
the
spirit
to
speak
is
not
to
think
logically
but
to
is
also
to
sidenote
of
the
negations
of
this
that
thought
can
not
exist
without
speech
is
a
truth
generally
admitted
the
negations
of
this
thesis
are
all
founded
on
equivocations
and
errors
the
first
of
the
equivocations
is
that
of
those
who
observe
that
one
can
likewise
think
with
geometrical
figures
algebraical
numbers
ideographic
signs
without
any
word
even
pronounced
silently
and
almost
insensibly
within
one
that
there
are
languages
in
which
the
word
the
phonetic
sign
expresses
nothing
unless
the
written
sign
also
be
examined
and
so
on
but
when
we
said
speak
we
intended
to
employ
a
synecdoche
by
which
was
to
be
understood
expression
in
general
for
we
have
already
remarked
that
expression
is
not
only
verbal
expression
it
may
or
may
not
be
true
that
certain
concepts
may
be
thought
without
phonetic
manifestations
but
the
very
examples
adduced
to
show
this
also
prove
that
those
concepts
never
exist
without
expressions
others
point
out
that
animals
or
certain
animals
think
and
reason
without
speaking
now
as
to
how
whether
and
what
animals
think
whether
they
be
rudimentary
men
like
savages
who
refuse
to
be
civilized
rather
than
physiological
machines
as
the
old
spiritualists
maintained
are
questions
that
do
not
concern
us
here
when
the
philosopher
talks
of
animal
brutal
impulsive
instinctive
nature
and
the
like
he
does
not
base
himself
on
such
conjectures
as
to
dogs
or
cats
lions
or
ants
but
upon
observations
of
what
is
called
animal
and
brutal
in
man
of
the
animal
side
or
basis
of
what
we
feel
in
ourselves
if
individual
animals
dogs
or
cats
lions
or
ants
possess
something
of
the
activity
of
man
so
much
the
better
or
so
much
the
worse
for
them
this
means
that
in
respect
to
them
also
we
must
talk
not
of
nature
as
a
whole
but
of
its
animal
basis
as
being
perhaps
larger
and
stronger
in
them
than
the
animal
basis
of
man
and
if
we
suppose
that
animals
think
and
form
concepts
what
kind
of
conjecture
would
justify
the
assertion
that
they
do
so
without
corresponding
expressions
analogy
with
man
knowledge
of
the
spirit
human
psychology
the
instrument
of
all
our
conjectures
as
to
animal
psychology
would
constrain
us
on
the
contrary
to
suppose
that
if
they
think
in
any
way
they
also
somehow
speak
another
objection
is
derived
from
human
psychology
and
indeed
literary
psychology
to
the
effect
that
the
concept
can
exist
without
the
word
for
it
is
certainly
true
that
we
all
know
books
thought
and
ill
that
is
to
say
a
thought
which
remains
the
expression
or
faulty
expression
but
when
we
talk
of
books
well
thought
and
ill
written
we
can
not
mean
anything
but
that
in
such
books
are
parts
pages
periods
or
propositions
well
thought
and
well
written
and
other
parts
perhaps
the
least
important
ill
thought
and
ill
written
not
really
thought
and
so
not
really
expressed
where
vico
is
really
ill
written
it
is
also
ill
thought
if
we
pass
from
the
consideration
of
big
books
to
a
short
sentence
the
error
or
inaccuracy
of
such
a
contention
will
leap
to
the
eyes
how
could
a
single
sentence
be
clearly
thought
and
confusedly
written
all
that
can
be
admitted
is
that
sometimes
we
possess
thoughts
concepts
in
an
intuitive
form
which
is
an
abbreviated
or
rather
peculiar
expression
sufficient
for
us
but
not
sufficient
to
communicate
it
easily
to
any
other
given
person
or
persons
hence
it
is
incorrect
to
say
that
we
have
the
thought
without
the
expression
whereas
we
should
rather
say
that
we
have
indeed
the
expression
but
in
such
a
form
that
it
is
not
easy
to
communicate
it
to
others
this
however
is
a
very
variable
relative
fact
there
are
always
those
who
catch
our
thought
on
the
wing
prefer
it
in
this
abbreviated
form
and
would
be
wearied
by
the
greater
development
of
it
required
by
others
in
other
words
the
thought
considered
abstractly
and
logically
will
be
the
same
but
æsthetically
we
are
dealing
with
two
different
into
which
different
psychological
elements
enter
the
same
argument
suffices
to
destroy
that
is
to
interpret
correctly
the
altogether
empirical
distinctior
between
an
and
an
language
sidenote
and
the
most
lofty
manifestations
the
summits
of
intellectual
and
of
intuitive
knowledge
shining
from
afar
are
called
as
we
know
art
and
science
art
and
science
then
are
different
and
yet
linked
together
they
meet
on
one
side
which
is
the
æsthetic
side
every
scientific
work
is
also
a
work
of
art
the
æsthetic
side
may
remain
little
noticed
when
our
mind
is
altogether
taken
up
with
the
effort
to
understand
the
thought
of
the
man
of
science
and
to
examine
its
truth
but
it
is
no
longer
unnoticed
when
we
pass
from
the
activity
of
understanding
to
that
of
contemplation
and
see
that
thought
either
develop
itself
before
us
limpid
exact
without
superfluous
or
insufficient
words
with
appropriate
rhythm
and
intonation
or
confused
broken
embarrassed
tentative
great
thinkers
are
sometimes
called
great
writers
while
other
equally
great
thinkers
remain
more
or
less
fragmentary
writers
even
if
their
fragments
have
the
scientific
value
of
harmonious
coherent
and
perfect
works
we
pardon
thinkers
and
men
of
science
their
literary
mediocrity
the
fragments
the
flashes
console
us
for
the
whole
because
it
is
far
easier
to
recover
the
composition
from
the
fragmentary
work
of
genius
to
liberate
the
flame
latent
in
the
spark
than
to
achieve
the
discovery
of
genius
but
how
can
we
pardon
mediocre
expression
in
pure
artists
esse
poetis
non
di
non
homines
non
concessere
the
poet
or
painter
who
lacks
form
lacks
everything
because
he
lacks
poetical
material
permeates
the
souls
of
all
the
expression
alone
that
is
to
say
the
form
makes
the
poet
and
here
appears
the
truth
of
the
view
which
denies
all
content
to
art
just
the
intellectual
concept
being
understood
as
content
in
this
sense
when
we
take
content
as
equal
to
concept
it
is
most
true
not
only
that
art
does
not
consist
of
content
but
also
that
has
no
sidenote
and
form
another
meaning
prose
and
the
distinction
between
and
also
can
not
be
justified
save
as
that
between
art
and
science
it
was
seen
in
antiquity
that
such
distinction
could
not
be
founded
on
external
elements
such
as
rhythm
and
metre
or
on
rhymed
or
unrhymed
form
that
it
was
on
the
contrary
altogether
internal
poetry
is
the
language
of
feeling
prose
of
the
intellect
but
since
the
intellect
is
also
feeling
in
its
concreteness
and
reality
all
prose
has
its
poetical
side
sidenote
relation
of
first
and
second
the
relation
between
intuitive
knowledge
or
expression
and
intellectual
knowledge
or
concept
between
art
and
science
poetry
and
prose
can
not
be
otherwise
defined
than
by
saying
that
it
is
one
of
the
first
degree
is
the
expression
the
second
the
concept
the
first
can
stand
without
the
second
but
the
second
can
not
stand
without
the
first
there
is
poetry
without
prose
but
not
prose
without
poetry
expression
indeed
is
the
first
affirmation
of
human
activity
poetry
is
the
mother
tongue
of
the
human
race
the
first
men
were
by
nature
sublime
poets
we
assert
this
in
another
way
when
we
observe
that
the
passage
from
soul
to
spirit
from
animal
to
human
activity
is
effected
by
means
of
language
and
this
should
be
said
of
intuition
or
expression
in
general
but
to
us
it
appears
somewhat
inaccurate
to
define
language
or
expression
as
an
link
between
nature
and
humanity
as
though
it
were
a
mixture
of
both
where
humanity
appears
the
other
has
already
disappeared
the
man
who
expresses
himself
certainly
emerges
from
the
state
of
nature
but
he
really
does
emerge
he
does
not
stand
half
within
and
half
without
as
the
use
of
the
phrase
intermediate
link
would
imply
sidenote
of
other
forms
of
the
cognitive
spirit
has
no
form
other
than
these
two
expression
and
concept
exhaust
it
completely
the
whole
speculative
life
of
man
is
spent
in
passing
from
one
to
the
other
and
back
again
sidenote
its
identity
with
and
difference
from
is
incorrectly
held
to
be
a
third
theoretical
form
historicity
is
not
form
but
content
as
form
it
is
nothing
but
intuition
or
æsthetic
fact
history
does
not
seek
for
laws
nor
form
concepts
it
employs
neither
induction
nor
deduction
it
is
directed
narrandum
non
ad
it
does
not
construct
universals
and
abstractions
but
posits
intuitions
the
this
and
here
the
omnimode
determinatum
is
its
domain
as
it
is
the
domain
of
art
history
therefore
is
included
in
the
universal
concept
of
art
as
against
this
doctrine
in
view
of
the
impossibility
of
conceiving
a
third
mode
of
knowledge
objections
have
been
brought
forward
which
would
lead
to
the
affiliation
of
history
to
intellectual
or
scientific
knowledge
the
greater
portion
of
these
objections
is
animated
by
the
prejudice
that
in
refusing
to
history
the
character
of
conceptual
science
something
of
its
value
and
dignity
has
been
taken
from
it
this
really
arises
from
a
false
idea
of
art
conceived
not
as
an
essential
theoretic
function
but
as
an
amusement
a
superfluity
a
frivolity
without
reopening
a
long
debate
which
so
far
as
we
are
concerned
is
finally
closed
we
will
mention
here
one
sophism
which
has
been
and
still
is
widely
repeated
its
purpose
is
to
show
the
logical
and
scientific
nature
of
history
the
sophism
consists
in
admitting
that
historical
knowledge
has
for
its
object
the
individual
but
not
the
representation
it
is
added
but
rather
the
concept
of
the
individual
from
this
it
is
argued
that
history
is
also
a
logical
or
scientific
form
of
knowledge
history
in
fact
is
supposed
to
work
out
the
concept
of
a
personage
such
as
charlemagne
or
napoleon
of
an
epoch
like
the
renaissance
or
the
reformation
of
an
event
such
as
the
french
revolution
and
the
unification
of
italy
this
it
is
held
to
do
in
the
same
way
as
geometry
works
out
the
concepts
of
spatial
forms
or
æsthetic
that
of
expression
but
all
this
is
untrue
history
can
not
do
otherwise
than
napoleon
and
charlemagne
the
renaissance
and
the
reformation
the
french
revolution
and
the
unification
of
italy
as
individual
facts
with
their
individual
physiognomy
that
is
in
the
sense
in
which
logicians
use
the
word
represent
when
they
say
that
one
can
not
have
a
concept
of
the
individual
but
only
a
representation
the
concept
of
the
individual
is
always
a
universal
or
general
concept
full
of
characteristics
supremely
full
if
you
like
but
however
full
it
be
incapable
of
attaining
to
that
individuality
to
which
historical
knowledge
as
æsthetic
knowledge
alone
attains
to
show
how
the
content
of
history
comes
to
be
distinguished
from
that
of
art
in
the
narrow
sense
we
must
recall
what
has
already
been
observed
as
to
the
ideal
character
of
the
intuition
or
first
perception
in
which
all
is
real
and
therefore
nothing
is
real
only
at
a
later
stage
does
the
spirit
form
the
concepts
of
external
and
internal
of
what
has
happened
and
what
is
desired
of
object
and
subject
and
the
like
only
at
this
later
stage
that
is
does
it
distinguish
historical
from
intuition
the
from
the
real
imagination
from
pure
imagination
even
internal
facts
what
is
desired
and
imagined
castles
in
the
air
and
countries
of
cockaigne
have
their
reality
and
the
soul
too
has
its
history
his
illusions
form
part
of
the
biography
of
every
individual
as
real
facts
but
the
history
of
an
individual
soul
is
history
because
the
distinction
between
the
real
and
the
unreal
is
always
active
in
it
even
when
the
illusions
themselves
are
the
real
but
these
distinctive
concepts
do
not
appear
in
history
like
the
concepts
of
science
but
rather
like
those
that
we
have
seen
dissolved
and
melted
in
the
æsthetic
intuitions
although
in
history
they
stand
out
in
a
manner
altogether
special
to
themselves
history
does
not
construct
the
concepts
of
the
real
and
unreal
but
makes
use
of
them
history
in
fact
is
not
the
theory
of
history
mere
conceptual
analysis
is
of
no
use
in
ascertaining
whether
an
event
in
our
lives
was
real
or
imaginary
we
must
mentally
reproduce
the
intuitions
in
the
most
complete
form
as
they
were
at
the
moment
of
production
historicity
is
distinguished
in
the
concrete
from
pure
imagination
as
any
one
intuition
is
distinguished
from
any
other
in
memory
sidenote
where
this
is
not
possible
where
the
delicate
and
fleeting
shades
between
the
real
and
unreal
intuitions
are
so
slight
as
to
mingle
the
one
with
the
other
we
must
either
renounce
for
the
time
being
at
least
the
knowledge
of
what
really
happened
and
this
we
often
do
or
we
must
fall
back
upon
conjecture
verisimilitude
probability
the
principle
of
verisimilitude
and
of
probability
in
fact
dominates
all
historical
criticism
examination
of
sources
and
authorities
is
devoted
to
establishing
the
most
credible
evidence
and
what
is
the
most
credible
evidence
save
that
of
the
best
observers
that
is
of
those
who
best
remember
and
be
it
understood
have
not
wished
to
falsify
nor
had
interest
in
falsifying
the
truth
of
things
sidenote
from
this
it
follows
that
intellectualistic
scepticism
finds
it
easy
to
deny
the
certainty
of
any
history
for
the
certainty
of
history
differs
from
that
of
science
it
is
the
certainty
of
memory
and
of
authority
not
that
of
analysis
and
demonstration
to
speak
of
historical
induction
or
demonstration
is
to
make
a
metaphorical
use
of
these
expressions
which
bear
a
quite
different
meaning
in
history
to
that
which
they
bear
in
science
the
conviction
of
the
historian
is
the
undemonstrable
conviction
of
the
juryman
who
has
heard
the
witnesses
listened
attentively
to
the
case
and
prayed
heaven
to
inspire
him
sometimes
without
doubt
he
is
mistaken
but
the
mistakes
are
in
a
negligible
minority
compared
with
the
occasions
when
he
grasps
the
truth
that
is
why
good
sense
is
right
against
the
intellectualists
in
believing
in
history
which
is
not
a
fable
agreed
upon
but
what
the
individual
and
humanity
remember
of
their
past
we
strive
to
enlarge
and
to
render
as
precise
as
possible
this
record
which
in
some
places
is
dim
in
others
very
clear
we
can
not
do
without
it
such
as
it
is
and
taken
as
a
whole
it
is
rich
in
truth
only
in
a
spirit
of
paradox
can
one
doubt
that
there
ever
was
a
greece
or
a
rome
an
alexander
or
a
cæsar
a
feudal
europe
overthrown
by
a
series
of
revolutions
that
on
the
of
november
the
theses
of
luther
were
fixed
to
the
door
of
the
church
at
wittemberg
or
that
the
bastile
was
taken
by
the
people
of
paris
on
the
of
july
what
proof
hast
thou
of
all
this
asks
the
sophist
ironically
humanity
replies
i
remember
it
sidenote
as
perfect
science
the
natural
sciences
and
their
the
world
of
what
has
happened
of
the
concrete
of
historical
fact
is
the
world
called
real
natural
including
in
this
definition
both
the
reality
called
physical
and
that
called
spiritual
and
human
all
this
world
is
intuition
historical
intuition
if
it
be
shown
as
it
realistically
is
imaginary
or
artistic
intuition
in
the
narrow
sense
if
presented
in
the
aspect
of
the
possible
that
is
to
say
of
the
imaginable
science
true
science
which
is
not
intuition
but
concept
not
individuality
but
universality
can
not
be
anything
but
science
of
the
spirit
that
is
of
what
reality
has
of
universal
philosophy
if
natural
be
spoken
of
apart
from
philosophy
we
must
observe
that
these
are
not
perfect
sciences
they
are
aggregates
of
cognitions
arbitrarily
abstracted
and
fixed
the
natural
sciences
indeed
themselves
recognize
that
they
are
surrounded
by
limitations
and
these
limitations
are
nothing
but
historical
and
intuitive
data
they
calculate
measure
establish
equalities
and
uniformities
create
classes
and
types
formulate
laws
show
in
their
own
way
how
one
fact
arises
out
of
other
facts
but
while
doing
this
they
are
constantly
running
into
facts
known
intuitively
and
historically
even
geometry
now
states
that
it
rests
altogether
on
hypotheses
since
threedimensional
or
euclidean
space
is
but
one
of
the
possible
spaces
selected
for
purposes
of
study
because
more
convenient
what
is
true
in
the
natural
sciences
is
either
philosophy
or
historical
fact
what
of
properly
naturalistic
they
contain
is
abstraction
and
caprice
when
the
natural
sciences
wish
to
become
perfect
sciences
they
must
leave
their
circle
and
enter
philosophy
they
do
this
when
they
posit
concepts
which
are
anything
but
naturalistic
such
as
those
of
the
unextended
atom
of
ether
or
vibration
of
vital
force
of
space
and
the
like
these
are
true
and
proper
attempts
at
philosophy
when
they
are
not
mere
words
void
of
meaning
the
concepts
of
natural
science
are
without
doubt
most
useful
but
one
can
not
obtain
from
them
that
which
belongs
only
to
the
spirit
these
historical
and
intuitive
data
which
can
not
be
eliminated
from
the
natural
sciences
furthermore
explain
not
only
how
with
the
advance
of
knowledge
what
was
once
believed
to
be
true
sinks
gradually
to
the
level
of
mythological
belief
and
fantastic
illusion
but
also
how
among
natural
scientists
some
are
to
be
found
who
call
everything
in
their
sciences
upon
which
reasoning
is
founded
facts
verbal
expedients
or
natural
scientists
and
mathematicians
who
approach
the
study
of
the
energies
of
the
spirit
without
preparation
are
apt
to
carry
thither
such
mental
habits
and
to
speak
in
philosophy
of
such
and
such
conventions
as
decreed
by
man
they
make
conventions
of
truth
and
morality
and
a
supreme
convention
of
the
spirit
itself
but
if
there
are
to
be
conventions
something
must
exist
which
is
no
convention
but
is
itself
the
author
of
conventions
this
is
the
spiritual
activity
of
man
the
limitation
of
the
natural
sciences
postulates
the
illimitability
of
philosophy
sidenote
phenomenon
and
the
these
explications
have
firmly
established
that
the
pure
or
fundamental
forms
of
knowledge
are
two
the
intuition
and
the
concept
art
and
science
or
philosophy
with
these
are
to
be
included
history
which
is
as
it
were
the
product
of
intuition
placed
in
contact
with
the
concept
that
is
of
art
receiving
in
itself
philosophic
distinctions
while
remaining
concrete
and
individual
all
other
forms
natural
sciences
and
mathematics
are
impure
being
mingled
with
extraneous
elements
of
practical
origin
intuition
gives
us

in

these
relations
between
intuitive
or
æsthetic
knowledge
and
the
other
fundamental
or
derivative
forms
of
knowledge
having
been
definitely
established
we
are
now
in
a
position
to
reveal
the
errors
of
a
series
of
theories
which
have
been
or
are
presented
as
theories
of
æsthetic
sidenote
of
probability
and
of
from
the
confusion
between
the
demands
of
art
in
general
and
the
particular
demands
of
history
has
resulted
the
theory
which
has
lost
ground
but
was
once
dominant
of
the
as
the
object
of
art
as
is
generally
the
case
with
erroneous
propositions
the
meaning
of
those
who
employed
and
employ
the
concept
of
probability
has
no
doubt
often
been
much
more
reasonable
than
their
definition
of
the
word
by
probability
used
really
to
be
meant
the
artistic
of
the
representation
that
is
to
say
its
completeness
and
effectiveness
its
actual
presence
if
probable

translated
coherent
a
very
just
meaning
will
often
be
found
in
the
discussions
examples
and
judgements
of
the
critics
who
employ
this
word
an
improbable
personage
an
improbable
ending
to
a
comedy
are
really
personages
endings
happenings
without
artistic
motive
it
has
been
said
with
reason
that
even
fairies
and
sprites
must
have
probability

to
say
be
really

and
fairies
coherent
artistic
intuitions
sometimes
the
word
possible
has
been
used
instead
of
probable
as
we
have
already
remarked
in
passing
this
word
possible
is
synonymous
with
the
imaginable
or
intuitible
everything
truly
that
is
to
say
coherently
imagined
is
possible
but
also
by
a
good
many
critics
and
theorists
the
probable
was
taken
to
mean
the
historically
credible
or
that
historical
truth
which
is
not
demonstrable
but
conjecturable
not
true
but
probable
this
was
the
character
which
these
theorists
sought
to
impose
upon
art
who
does
not
remember
how
great
a
part
was
played
in
literary
history
by
criticism
based
on
probability
for
example
censure
of
delivered
based
upon
the
history
of
the
crusades
or
of
the
homeric
poems
upon
the
probable
customs
of
emperors
and
kings
sometimes
too
the
æsthetic
reproduction
of
historical
reality
has
been
imposed
upon
art
this
is
another
of
the
erroneous
forms
taken
by
the
theory
of
the
of
verism
and
naturalism
also
have
afforded
the
spectacle
of
a
confusion
of
the
æsthetic
fact
with
the
processes
of
the
natural
sciences
by
aiming
at
some
sort
of
drama
or
romance
sidenote
of
ideas
in
art
of
theses
in
art
and
of
the
confusions
between
the
methods
of
art
and
those
of
the
philosophic
sciences
have
been
far
more
frequent
thus
it
has
often
been
held
to
be
the
task
of
art
to
expound
concepts
to
unite
an
intelligible
with
a
sensible
to
represent
or
putting
art
in
the
place
of
science
that
is
confusing
the
artistic
function
in
general
with
the
particular
case
in
which
it
becomes
the
theory
of
art
as
supporting
of
art
considered
as
an
individual
representation
exemplifying
scientific
laws
can
be
proved
false
in
like
manner
the
example
as
example
stands
for
the
thing
exemplified
and
is
thus
an
exposition
of
the
universal
that
is
to
say
a
form
of
science
more
or
less
popular
or
vulgarizing
the
same
may
be
said
of
the
æsthetic
theory
of
the
when
by
type
is
understood
as
it
frequently
is
the
abstraction
or
the
concept
and
it
is
affirmed
that
art
should
make
the
shine
in
the
if
individual
be
here
understood
by
typical
we
have
here
too
a
merely
verbal
variation
to
typify
would
signify
in
this
case
to
characterize
that
is
to
determine
and
to
represent
the
individual
don
quixote
is
a
type
but
of
what
is
he
a
type
save
of
all
don
quixotes
a
type
so
to
speak
of
himself
certainly
he
is
not
a
type
of
abstract
concepts
such
as
the
loss
of
the
sense
of
reality
or
of
the
love
of
glory
an
infinite
number
of
personages
can
be
thought
of
under
these
concepts
who
are
not
don
quixotes
in
other
words
we
find
our
own
impressions
fully
determined
and
realized
in
the
expression
of
a
poet
for
example
in
a
poetical
personage
we
call
that
expression
typical
which
we
might
call
simply
æsthetic
thus
poetical
or
artistic
universals
have
sometimes
been
spoken
of
only
to
show
that
the
artistic
product
is
altogether
spiritual
and
ideal
sidenote
of
the
symbol
and
of
the
continuing
to
correct
these
errors
or
to
clear
up
misunderstandings
we
shall
also
remark
that
the
has
sometimes
been
given
as
the
essence
of
art
now
if
the
symbol
be
conceived
as
inseparable
from
the
artistic
intuition
it
is
a
synonym
for
the
intuition
itself
which
always
has
an
ideal
character
there
is
no
double
bottom
to
art
but
one
only
in
art
all
is
symbolical
because
all
is
ideal
but
if
the
symbol
be
conceived
as
separable
if
the
symbol
can
be
on
one
side
and
on
the
other
the
thing
symbolized
we
fall
back
again
into
the
intellectualist
error
the
symbol
is
the
exposition
of
an
abstract
concept
an
it
is
science
or
art
aping
science
but
we
must
also
be
just
toward
the
allegorical
sometimes
it
is
altogether
harmless
given
the
liberata
the
allegory
was
imagined
afterwards
given
the
of
marino
the
poet
of
the
lascivious
afterwards
insinuated
that
it
was
written
to
show
how
immoderate
indulgence
ends
in
pain
given
a
statue
of
a
beautiful
woman
the
sculptor
can
attach
a
label
to
the
statue
saying
that
it
represents
or
this
allegory
that
arrives
attached
to
a
finished
work
does
not
change
the
work
of
art
what
then
is
it
it
is
an
expression
externally
to
another
expression
a
little
page
of
prose
is
added
to
the
expressing
another
thought
of
the
poet
a
verse
or
a
strophe
is
added
to
the
expressing
what
the
poet
would
like
to
make
a
part
of
his
public
believe
to
the
statue
nothing
but
the
single
word
or
sidenote
of
the
theory
of
artistic
and
literary
but
the
greatest
triumph
of
the
intellectualist
error
lies
in
the
theory
of
artistic
and
literary
kinds
which
still
has
vogue
in
literary
treatises
and
disturbs
the
critics
and
the
historians
of
art
let
us
observe
its
genesis
the
human
mind
can
pass
from
the
æsthetic
to
the
logical
just
because
the
former
is
a
first
step
in
respect
to
the
latter
it
can
destroy
expression
that
is
the
thought
of
the
individual
by
thinking
of
the
universal
it
can
gather
up
expressive
facts
into
logical
relations
we
have
already
shown
that
this
operation
becomes
in
its
turn
concrete
in
an
expression
but
this
does
not
mean
that
the
first
expressions
have
not
been
destroyed
they
have
yielded
their
place
to
the
new
expressions
when
we
are
on
the
second
step
we
have
left
the
first
one
who
enters
a
or
who
reads
a
series
of
poems
having
looked
and
read
may
go
further
he
may
seek
out
the
nature
and
the
relations
of
the
things
there
expressed
thus
those
pictures
and
compositions
each
of
which
is
an
individual
inexpressible
in
logical
terms
are
gradually
resolved
into
universals
and
abstractions
such
as
landscapes
portraits
domestic
life
battles
animals
flowers
fruit
seascapes
lakes
deserts
tragic
comic
pathetic
cruel
lyrical
epic
dramatic
chivalrous
idyllic
facts
and
the
like
they
are
often
also
resolved
into
merely
quantitative
categories
such
as
picture
statuette
group
madrigal
ballad
sonnet
poetry
poem
story
romance
and
the
like
when
we
think
the
concept
life
or
or
or
or
one
of
the
quantitative
concepts
mentioned
above
the
individual
expressive
fact
from
which
we
started
has
been
abandoned
from
æsthetes
that
we
were
we
have
changed
into
logicians
from
contemplators
of
expression
into
reasoners
certainly
no
objection
can
be
made
to
such
a
process
in
what
other
way
could
science
arise
which
if
it
have
æsthetic
expressions
presupposed
in
it
must
yet
go
beyond
them
in
order
to
fulfil
its
function
the
logical
or
scientific
form
as
such
excludes
the
æsthetic
form
he
who
begins
to
think
scientifically
has
already
ceased
to
contemplate
æsthetically
although
his
thought
assumes
of
necessity
in
its
turn
an
æsthetic
form
as
has
already
been
said
and
as
it
would
be
superfluous
to
repeat
error
begins
when
we
try
to
deduce
the
expression
from
the
concept
and
to
find
in
what
takes
its
place
the
laws
of
the
thing
whose
place
is
taken
when
the
difference
between
the
second
and
the
first
step
has
not
been
observed
and
when
in
consequence
we
declare
that
we
are
standing
on
the
first
step
when
we
are
really
standing
on
the
second
this
error
is
known
as
the
of
artistic
and
literary
what
is
the
form
of
domestic
life
of
chivalry
of
the
idyll
of
cruelty
and
so
forth
how
should
these
contents
be
such
is
the
absurd
problem
implied
in
the
theory
of
artistic
and
literary
classes
when
it
has
been
shorn
of
excrescences
and
reduced
to
a
simple
formula
it
is
in
this
that
consists
all
search
after
laws
or
rules
of
classes
domestic
life
chivalry
idyll
cruelty
and
the
like
are
not
impressions
but
concepts
they
are
not
contents
but
forms
you
can
not
express
the
form
for
it
is
already
itself
expression
for
what
are
the
words
cruelty
idyll
chivalry
domestic
life
and
so
on
but
the
expression
of
those
concepts
even
the
most
refined
of
such
distinctions
which
possess
the
most
philosophic
appearance
do
not
resist
criticism
as
when
works
of
art
are
divided
into
subjective
and
objective
kinds
into
lyric
and
epic
into
works
of
feeling
and
decorative
works
in
æsthetic
analysis
it
is
impossible
to
separate
subjective
from
objective
lyric
from
epic
the
image
of
feeling
from
that
of
things
sidenote
derived
from
this
theory
in
judgements
on
from
the
theory
of
artistic
and
literary
kinds
derive
those
erroneous
modes
of
judgement
and
of
criticism
thanks
to
which
instead
of
asking
before
a
work
of
art
if
it
be
expressive
and
what
it
expresses
whether
it
speak
or
stammer
or
is
altogether
silent
they
ask
if
it
obey
the
of
epic
or
of
tragedy
of
historical
painting
or
of
landscape
while
making
a
verbal
pretence
of
agreeing
or
yielding
a
feigned
obedience
artists
have
however
really
always
disregarded
these
of
the
every
true
work
of
art
has
violated
some
established
kind
and
upset
the
ideas
of
the
critics
who
have
thus
been
obliged
to
broaden
the
kinds
until
finally
even
the
broadened
kind
has
proved
too
narrow
owing
to
the
appearance
of
new
works
of
art
naturally
followed
by
new
scandals
new
upsettings
and
new
broadenings
to
the
same
theory
are
due
the
prejudices
owing
to
which
at
one
time
is
it
really
passed
people
used
to
lament
that
italy
had
no
tragedy
until
one
arose
who
bestowed
such
a
wreath
which
alone
of
adornments
was
wanting
to
her
glorious
locks
nor
france
the
epic
poem
until
the
which
slaked
the
thirsty
throats
of
the
critics
eulogies
accorded
to
the
inventors
of
new
kinds
are
connected
with
these
prejudices
so
much
so
that
in
the
seventeenth
century
the
invention
of
the
poem
seemed
an
important
event
and
the
honour
of
it
was
disputed
as
though
it
were
the
discovery
of
america
but
the
works
adorned
with
this
name
the
and
the
degli
were
because
their
authors
a
slight
drawback
had
nothing
new
or
original
to
say
mediocrities
racked
their
brains
to
invent
new
kinds
artificially
the
eclogue
was
added
to
the
and
finally
the
eclogue
the
was
dipped
and
became
the
finally
there
have
been
historians
of
art
and
literature
so
much
fascinated
with
these
ideas
of
kinds
that
they
claimed
to
write
the
history
not
of
individual
and
real
literary
and
artistic
works
but
of
those
empty
phantoms
their
kinds
they
have
claimed
to
portray
not
the
evolution
of
the
spirit
but
the
of
the
philosophical
condemnation
of
artistic
and
literary
kinds
is
found
in
the
formulation
and
demonstration
of
what
artistic
activity
has
always
done
and
good
taste
always
recognized
what
are
we
to
do
if
good
taste
and
the
real
fact
when
reduced
to
formulas
sometimes
assume
the
air
of
paradoxes
sidenote
sense
of
the
divisions
of
it
is
not
scientifically
incorrect
to
talk
of
tragedies
comedies
dramas
romances
pictures
of
everyday
life
landscapes
seascapes
poems
versicles
lyrics
and
the
like
if
it
be
only
with
a
view
to
be
understood
and
to
draw
attention
to
certain
groups
of
works
in
general
and
approximately
to
which
for
one
reason
or
another
it
is
desired
to
draw
attention
to
employ
and
is
not
to
establish
and
the
mistake
only
arises
when
the
weight
of
a
scientific
definition
is
given
to
a
word
when
we
ingenuously
let
ourselves
be
caught
in
the
meshes
of
that
phraseology
pray
permit
me
a
comparison
the
books
in
a
library
must
be
arranged
in
one
way
or
another
this
used
generally
to
be
done
by
a
rough
classification
of
subjects
among
which
the
categories
of
miscellaneous
and
eccentric
were
not
wanting
they
are
now
generally
arranged
by
sizes
or
by
publishers
who
can
deny
the
necessity
and
the
utility
of
such
arrangements
but
what
should
we
say
if
some
one
began
seriously
to
seek
out
the
literary
laws
of
miscellanies
and
of
eccentricities
of
the
aldines
or
bodonis
of
shelf
a
or
shelf
b
that
is
to
say
of
those
altogether
arbitrary
groupings
whose
sole
object
was
their
practical
utility
yet
should
any
one
attempt
such
an
undertaking
he
would
be
doing
neither
more
nor
less
than
those
do
who
seek
out
the
which
must
in
their
belief
control
literary
and
artistic
kinds
v
analogous
errors
in
the
theory
of
history
and
in
logic
the
better
to
confirm
these
criticisms
it
will
be
useful
to
cast
a
rapid
glance
over
analogous
and
opposite
errors
due
to
ignorance
as
to
the
true
nature
of
art
and
its
relation
to
history
and
to
science
these
errors
have
injured
alike
the
theory
of
history
and
that
of
science
historic
or
historiology
and
logic
sidenote
of
the
philosophy
of
historical
intellectualism
has
opened
the
way
to
the
many
attempts
made
especially
during
the
last
two
centuries
and
continued
to
discover
philosophy
of
history
an
history
a
a
psychology
or
whatever
else
a
science
may
be
called
whose
object
is
to
extract
from
history
concepts
and
universal
laws
what
must
these
laws
these
universals
be
historical
laws
and
historical
concepts
in
that
case
an
elementary
acquaintance
with
the
theory
of
knowledge
suffices
to
make
clear
the
absurdity
of
the
attempt
when
such
expressions
as
a
law
a
are
not
simply
metaphors
colloquially
employed
they
are
truly
contradictory
terms
the
adjective
is
as
unsuitable
to
the
substantive
as
in
the
expressions
qualitative
quantity
or
pluralistic
monism
history
implies
concreteness
and
individuality
law
and
concept
mean
abstractness
and
universality
but
if
the
attempt
to
extract
laws
and
concepts
from
history
be
abandoned
and
it
be
merely
desired
to
draw
from
it
laws
and
concepts
the
attempt
is
certainly
not
frivolous
but
the
science
thus
obtained
will
be
not
a
philosophy
of
history
but
rather
according
to
circumstances
either
philosophy
in
its
various
forms
of
ethics
logic
or
empirical
science
with
its
infinite
divisions
and
subdivisions
the
search
is
in
fact
either
for
those
philosophical
concepts
which
as
already
remarked
are
the
basis
of
every
historical
construction
and
differentiate
perception
from
intuition
historical
intuition
from
pure
intuition
history
from
art
or
already
formed
historical
intuitions
are
collected
and
arranged
in
types
and
classes
which
is
exactly
the
method
of
the
natural
sciences
great
thinkers
have
sometimes
donned
the
cloak
of
the
philosophy
of
history
and
notwithstanding
the
covering
they
have
attained
philosophical
truths
of
the
greatest
magnitude
the
cloak
discarded
the
truth
has
remained
modern
sociologists
are
rather
to
be
blamed
not
so
much
for
the
illusion
in
which
they
are
involved
when
they
talk
of
an
impossible
science
of
sociology
as
for
the
infecundity
which
almost
always
accompanies
their
illusion
it
matters
little
that
æsthetic
should
be
called
sociological
æsthetic
or
logic
sociological
logic
the
grave
evil
is
that
such
æsthetic
is
an
expression
of
sensationalism
such
logic
verbal
and
incoherent
the
philosophical
movement
to
which
we
have
referred
has
however
borne
two
good
fruits
in
relation
to
history
first
of
all
a
keener
desire
has
arisen
for
a
theory
of
history
that
is
a
theory
of
the
nature
and
the
limits
of
history
a
theory
which
in
conformity
with
the
analysis
made
above
can
not
obtain
satisfaction
save
in
a
general
science
of
intuition
in
an
æsthetic
in
which
the
theory
of
history
would
form
a
special
chapter
distinguished
by
the
insertion
of
universal
functions
furthermore
concrete
truths
relating
to
historical
events
have
often
been
expressed
beneath
the
false
and
presumptuous
cloak
of
a
philosophy
of
history
rules
and
warnings
have
been
formulated
empirical
no
doubt
yet
by
no
means
useless
to
students
and
critics
it
does
not
seem
possible
to
deny
this
utility
even
to
the
most
recent
of
philosophies
of
history
known
as
historical
materialism
which
has
thrown
a
very
vivid
light
upon
many
sides
of
social
life
formerly
neglected
or
ill
understood
sidenote
intrusions
into
the
principle
of
authority
of
the
is
an
intrusion
by
historicity
into
the
domains
of
science
and
philosophy
which
has
dominated
the
schools
and
substitutes
for
introspection
and
philosophical
analysis
this
or
that
evidence
document
or
authoritative
statement
with
which
history
certainly
can
not
dispense
but
logic
the
science
of
thought
and
of
intellectual
knowledge
has
suffered
the
most
grave
and
destructive
of
all
disturbances
and
errors
through
an
imperfect
understanding
of
the
æsthetic
fact
how
could
it
be
otherwise
if

after

æsthetic
activity
an
inexact
æsthetic
must
of
necessity
drag
after
it
an
inexact
logic
whoever
opens
a
logical
treatise
from
the
of
aristotle
to
the
modern
works
on
the
subject
must
agree
that
all
contain
a
haphazard
mixture
of
verbal
facts
and
facts
of
thought
of
grammatical
forms
and
of
conceptual
forms
of
æsthetic
and
of
logic
not
that
attempts
have
been
wanting
to
escape
from
verbal
expression
and
to
seize
thought
in
its
true
nature
aristotelian
logic
itself
did
not
become
mere
syllogistic
and
verbalism
without
some
hesitation
and
indecision
the
problem
proper
to
logic
was
often
touched
upon
in
their
disputes
by
the
nominalists
realists
and
conceptualists
of
the
middle
ages
with
galileo
and
with
bacon
the
natural
sciences
gave
an
honourable
place
to
induction
vico
combated
formalist
and
mathematical
logic
in
favour
of
inventive
methods
kant
called
attention
to
the
synthesis
absolute
idealism
despised
the
aristotelian
logic
the
followers
of
herbart
though
still
loyal
to
aristotle
emphasized
those
judgements
which
they
called
narrative
and
which
have
a
character
altogether
differing
from
that
of
other
logical
judgements
finally
the
linguists
insisted
upon
the
irrationality
of
the
word
in
relation
to
the
concept
but
a
conscious
sure
and
radical
movement
of
reform
can
find
no
basis
or
point
of
departure
save
in
the
science
of
æsthetic
sidenote
in
its
in
a
logic
suitably
reformed
on
this
basis
this
truth
must
first
and
foremost
be
proclaimed
and
all
its
consequences
deduced
the
logical
fact
only
logical
fact
is
concept
the
universal
the
spirit
that
forms
and
in
so
far
as
it
forms
the
universal
and
if
by
induction
be
understood
as
sometimes
it
has
been
the
formation
of
universals
and
by
deduction
their
verbal
development
then
it
is
clear
that
true
logic
can
be
nothing
but
inductive
logic
but
since
by
the
word
deduction
has
been
more
frequently
understood
the
special
processes
of
mathematics
and
the
word
induction
those
of
the
natural
sciences
it
will
be
best
to
avoid
both
words
and
say
that
true
logic
is
logic
of
the
concept
the
logic
of
the
concept
while
employing
a
method
which
is
both
induction
and
deduction
will
employ
neither
exclusively
that
is
it
will
employ
the
speculative
method
which
is
intrinsic
to
it
the
concept
the
universal
considered
abstractly
in
itself
is
no
word
is
proper
to
it
so
true
is
this
that
the
logical
concept
remains
always
the
same
notwithstanding
the
variation
of
verbal
forms
in
respect
to
the
concept
expression
is
a
simple
or
there
must
be
an
expression
it
can
not
be
absent
but
what
it
is
to
be
this
or
that
is
determined
by
the
historical
and
psychological
conditions
of
the
individual
who
is
speaking
the
quality
of
the
expression
is
not
deducible
from
the
nature
of
the
concept
there
does
not
exist
a
true
logical
sense
of
words
the
true
sense
of
words
is
that
which
is
conferred
upon
them
on
each
occasion
by
the
person
forming
a
concept
sidenote
between
logical
and
this
being
so
the
only
truly
logical
that
is
propositions
the
only
rigorously
logical
judgements
must
be
those
whose
proper
and
sole
content
is
the
determination
of
a
concept
these
propositions
or
judgements
are
science
itself
is
nothing
but
a
collection
of
definitions
unified
in
a
supreme
definition
a
system
of
concepts
or
highest
concept
it
is
therefore
necessary
at
least
as
a
preliminary
to
exclude
from
logic
all
those
propositions
which
do
not
affirm
universals
narrative
judgements
not
less
than
those
termed
by
aristotle
such
as
the
expression
of
desires
are
not
properly
logical
judgements
they
are
either
purely
æsthetic
propositions
or
historical
propositions
peter
is
passing
it
is
raining
i
am
sleepy
i
want
to
read
these
and
an
infinity
of
propositions
of
the
same
kind
are
nothing
but
either
a
mere
enclosing
in
words
the
impression
of
the
fact
that
peter
is
passing
of
the
falling
rain
of
my
organism
inclining
to
sleep
and
of
my
will
directed
to
reading
or
an
existential
affirmation
concerning
those
facts
they
are
expressions
of
the
real
or
of
the
unreal
or
they
are
certainly
not
definitions
of
universals
sidenote
this
exclusion
can
not
meet
with
great
difficulties
it
is
already
almost
an
accomplished
fact
and
the
only
thing
required
is
to
render
it
explicit
decisive
and
coherent
but
what
is
to
be
done
with
all
that
part
of
human
thought
called
consisting
of
judgements
and
reasonings
based
upon
concepts
what
is
syllogistic
is
it
to
be
looked
down
upon
with
contempt
as
something
useless
as
has
so
often
been
done
by
the
humanists
in
their
reaction
against
scholasticism
by
absolute
idealism
by
the
enthusiastic
admiration
of
our
times
for
the
methods
of
observation
and
experiment
of
the
natural
sciences
syllogistic
reasonings
is
not
the
discovery
of
truth
it
is
the
art
of
expounding
debating
disputing
with
oneself
and
others
proceeding
from
concepts
already
formed
from
facts
already
observed
and
appealing
to
the
persistence
of
the
true
or
of
thought
such
is
the
meaning
of
the
laws
of
identity
and
contradiction
it
infers
consequences
from
those
data
that
is
it
what
has
already
been
discovered
therefore
if
it
be
an
per
from
the
point
of
view
of
invention
it
is
most
efficacious
in
teaching
and
in
exposition
to
reduce
affirmations
to
a
syllogistic
form
is
a
way
of
controlling
one
own
thought
and
of
criticizing
the
thought
of
others
it
is
easy
to
laugh
at
syllogizers
but
if
syllogistic
has
been
born
and
persists
it
must
have
good
reasons
of
its
own
satire
on
it
can
concern
only
its
abuses
such
as
the
attempt
to
prove
syllogistically
questions
of
fact
observation
and
intuition
or
the
neglect
of
profound
meditation
and
unprejudiced
investigation
of
problems
in
favour
of
syllogistic
externality
and
if
can
sometimes
aid
us
in
our
attempt
to
remember
with
ease
rapidly
to
control
the
results
of
our
own
thought
let
us
welcome
this
form
of
syllogistic
also
anticipated
by
leibnitz
among
others
and
again
attempted
by
some
in
our
own
days
but
precisely
because
syllogistic
is
the
art
of
exposition
and
debate
its
theory
can
not
hold
the
first
place
in
a
philosophical
logic
thus
usurping
that
belonging
to
the
doctrine
of
the
concept
which
is
the
central
and
dominating
doctrine
to
which
everything
logical
in
syllogistic
is
reducible
without
leaving
a
residuum
relations
of
concepts
subordination
identification
and
so
on
nor
must
it
ever
be
forgotten
that
concept
and
logical
judgement
and
syllogism
are
not
in
the
same
line
the
first
alone
is
the
logical
fact
the
second
and
third
are
the
forms
in
which
the
first
manifests
itself
these
in
so
far
as
they
are
forms
can
only
be
examined
æsthetically
grammatically
and
in
so
far
as
they
possess
logical
content
only
by
ignoring
the
forms
themselves
and
passing
to
the
doctrine
of
the
concept
sidenote
falsehood
and
æsthetic
this
confirms
the
truth
of
the
ordinary
remark
to
the
effect
that
he
who
reasons
ill
also
speaks
and
writes
ill
that
exact
logical
analysis
is
the
basis
of
good
expression
this
truth
is
a
tautology
for
to
reason
well
is
in
fact
to
express
oneself
well
because
the
expression
is
the
intuitive
possession
of
one
own
logical
thought
the
principle
of
contradiction
itself
is
at
bottom
nothing
but
the
æsthetic
principle
of
coherence
it
may
be
maintained
that
it
is
possible
to
write
and
to
speak
exceedingly
well
as
it
is
also
possible
to
reason
well
though
starting
from
erroneous
concepts
that
some
though
lacking
the
acuteness
that
makes
a
great
discoverer
are
nevertheless
exceedingly
lucid
writers
because
to
write
well
depends
upon
having
a
clear
intuition
of
one
own
thought
even
if
it
be
erroneous
not
of
its
scientific
but
of
its
æsthetic
truth
which
indeed
is
the
same
thing
as
writing
well
a
philosopher
like
schopenhauer
can
imagine
that
art
is
a
representation
of
the
platonic
ideas
this
doctrine
is
scientifically
false
yet
he
may
develop
this
false
knowledge
in
excellent
prose
æsthetically
most
true
but
we
have
already
replied
to
these
objections
when
observing
that
at
that
precise
point
where
a
speaker
or
a
writer
enunciates
an
concept
he
is
at
the
same
time
a
bad
speaker
and
a
bad
writer
although
he
may
afterwards
recover
himself
in
the
many
other
parts
of
his
thought
which
contain
true
propositions
not
connected
with
the
preceding
error
and
therefore
lucid
expressions
following
upon
confused
expressions
sidenote
all
researches
as
to
the
forms
of
judgements
and
of
syllogisms
their
conversions
and
their
various
relations
which
still
encumber
treatises
on
logic
are
therefore
destined
to
diminish
to
be
transformed
to
be
converted
into
something
else
the
doctrine
of
the
concept
and
of
the
organism
of
concepts
of
definition
of
system
of
philosophy
and
the
various
sciences
and
the
like
will
occupy
the
field
and
alone
will
constitute
true
and
proper
logic
those
who
first
had
some
suspicion
of
the
intimate
connexion
between
æsthetic
and
logic
and
conceived
æsthetic
as
a
of
sensible
were
peculiarly
addicted
to
applying
logical
categories
to
the
new
knowledge
talking
of
concepts
æsthetic
judgements
æsthetic
syllogisms
and
so
on
we
who
are
less
superstitious
as
regards
the
permanence
of
the
traditional
logic
of
the
schools
and
better
informed
as
to
the
nature
of
æsthetic
do
not
recommend
the
application
of
logic
to
æsthetic
but
the
liberation
of
logic
from
æsthetic
forms
these
have
given
rise
to
forms
or
categories
of
logic
due
to
the
adoption
of
altogether
arbitrary
and
distinctions
logic
thus
reformed
will
still
be
logic
it
will
study
the
true
form
or
activity
of
thought
the
concept
excluding
individual
and
particular
concepts
the
old
logic
is
ill
called
formal
it
would
be
better
to
call
it
or
formal
logic
will
drive
out
formalistic
logic
to
attain
this
object
it
will
not
be
necessary
to
have
recourse
as
some
have
done
to
a
real
or
material
logic
which
is
no
longer
a
science
of
thought
but
thought
itself
in
action
not
only
a
logic
but
the
whole
of
philosophy
in
which
logic
is
also
included
the
science
of
thought
logic
is
that
of
the
concept
as
that
of
imagination
æsthetic
is
that
of
expression
the
of
both
sciences
lies
in
exactly
carrying
out
in
every
particular
the
distinction
between
the
two
domains
to
the
fourth
italian
the
observations
contained
in
this
chapter
on
logic
which
are
not
all
of
them
clear
or
accurate
should
be
clarified
and
corrected
by
means
of
the
further
treatment
of
the
theme
in
the
second
volume
of
the
of
the
spirit
dedicated
to
logic
where
the
distinction
between
logical
and
historical
propositions
is
again
examined
and
their
synthetic
unity
demonstrated
vi
the
theoretic
activity
and
the
practical
activity
the
intuitive
and
intellectual
forms
contain
between
them
as
we
have
said
the
whole
theoretic
domain
of
the
spirit
but
it
is
not
possible
to
know
them
thoroughly
nor
to
criticize
another
series
of
erroneous
æsthetic
theories
without
first
establishing
clearly
the
relations
of
the
theoretic
spirit
with
the
spirit
sidenote
the
practical
form
or
activity
is
the
we
do
not
here
employ
this
word
in
the
sense
of
some
philosophical
systems
where
the
will
is
the
foundation
of
the
universe
the
ground
of
things
and
the
true
reality
nor
do
we
employ
it
in
the
wide
sense
of
other
systems
which
understand
by
will
the
energy
of
the
spirit
spirit
or
activity
in
general
making
of
every
act
of
the
human
spirit
an
act
of
will
neither
such
metaphysical
nor
such
metaphorical
meaning
is
ours
for
us
the
will
is
as
generally
understood
that
activity
of
the
spirit
which
differs
from
the
merely
theoretical
contemplation
of
things
and
is
productive
not
of
knowledge
but
of
actions
action
is
really
action
in
so
far
as
it
is
voluntary
it
is
not
necessary
to
remark
that
in
the
will
to
do
we
include
in
the
scientific
sense
also
what
is
usually
called
the
will
to
resist
to
reject
the
will
of
a
prometheus
which
also
is
action
sidenote
will
as
an
ulterior
stage
in
respect
to
man
understands
things
with
the
theoretical
form
with
the
practical
form
he
changes
them
with
the
one
he
appropriates
the
universe
with
the
other
he
creates
it
but
the
first
form
is
the
basis
of
the
second
and
the
relation
of
degree
which
we
have
already
found
existing
between
æsthetic
and
logical
activity
is
repeated
between
these
two
on
a
larger
scale
a
knowing
independent
of
the
will
is
thinkable
at
least
in
a
certain
sense
will
independent
of
knowing
is
unthinkable
blind
will
is
not
will
true
will
has
eyes
how
can
we
will
without
having
before
us
historical
intuitions
perceptions
of
objects
and
knowledge
of
logical
relations
which
enlightens
us
as
to
the
nature
of
those
objects
how
can
we
really
will
if
we
do
not
know
the
world
which
surrounds
us
or
how
to
change
things
by
acting
upon
them
sidenote
and
it
has
been
objected
that
men
of
action
practical
men
excellence
are
the
least
disposed
to
contemplate
and
to
theorize
their
energy
is
not
delayed
in
contemplation
it
rushes
at
once
into
will
and
conversely
that
contemplative
men
philosophers
are
often
very
mediocre
in
practical
matters
weak
willed
and
therefore
neglected
and
thrust
aside
in
the
tumult
of
life
it
is
easy
to
see
that
these
distinctions
are
merely
empirical
and
quantitative
certainly
the
practical
man
has
no
need
of
a
philosophical
system
in
order
to
act
but
in
the
spheres
where
he
does
act
he
starts
from
intuitions
and
concepts
which
are
perfectly
clear
to
him
otherwise
the
most
ordinary
actions
could
not
be
willed
it
would
not
be
possible
to
will
to
feed
oneself
for
instance
without
knowledge
of
the
food
and
of
the
link
of
cause
and
effect
between
certain
movements
and
certain
satisfactions
rising
gradually
to
the
more
complex
forms
of
action
for
example
to
the
political
how
could
we
will
anything
politically
good
or
bad
without
knowing
the
real
conditions
of
society
and
consequently
the
means
and
expedients
to
be
adopted
when
the
practical
man
feels
himself
in
the
dark
about
one
or
more
of
these
points
or
when
he
is
seized
with
doubt
action
either
does
not
begin
or
stops
it
is
then
that
the
theoretical
moment
which
in
the
rapid
succession
of
human
actions
is
hardly
noticed
and
rapidly
forgotten
becomes
important
and
occupies
consciousness
for
a
longer
time
and
if
this
moment
be
prolonged
then
the
practical
man
may
become
a
hamlet
divided
between
desire
for
action
and
his
deficient
theoretical
clarity
as
regards
the
situation
and
the
means
to
be
employed
and
if
he
develop
a
taste
for
contemplation
and
discovery
and
leave
willing
and
acting
to
a
greater
or
less
extent
to
others
there
is
formed
in
him
the
calm
disposition
of
the
artist
of
the
man
of
science
or
of
the
philosopher
who
in
practice
are
sometimes
incompetent
or
downright
immoral
these
observations
are
all
obvious
their
exactitude
can
not
be
denied
let
us
however
repeat
that
they
are
founded
on
quantitative
distinctions
and
do
not
disprove
but
confirm
the
fact
that
an
action
however
slight
it
be
can
not
really
be
an
action
that
is
an
action
that
is
willed
unless
it
be
preceded
by
the
cognitive
activity
sidenote
of
practical
judgements
or
judgements
of
some
psychologists
on
the
other
hand
place
before
practical
action
an
altogether
special
class
of
judgements
which
they
call
judgements
or
of
they
say
that
in
order
to
resolve
on
performing
an
action
there
must
have
been
a
judgement
to
the
effect
this
action
is
useful
this
action
is
good
and
at
first
sight
this
seems
to
have
the
testimony
of
consciousness
on
its
side
but
closer
observation
and
analysis
of
greater
subtlety
reveal
that
such
judgements
follow
instead
of
preceding
the
affirmation
of
the
will
and
are
nothing
but
the
expression
of
the
volition
already
exercised
a
good
or
useful
action
is
an
action
willed
it
will
always
be
impossible
to
distil
a
single
drop
of
usefulness
or
goodness
from
the
objective
study
of
things
we
do
not
desire
things
because
we

them
to
be
good
or
useful

we
know

to
be
good
and
useful
because
we
desire

here
too
the
rapidity
with
which
the
facts
of
consciousness
follow
one
another
has
given
rise
to
an
illusion
practical
action
is
preceded
by
knowledge
but
not
by
practical
knowledge
or
rather
knowledge
of
the
practical
to
obtain
this
we
must
first
have
practical
action
the
third
moment
therefore
of
practical
judgements
or
judgements
of
value
is
altogether
imaginary
it
does
not
come
between
the
two
moments
or
degrees
of
theory
and
practice
for
the
rest
normative
sciences
in
general
which
regulate
or
command
discover
and
indicate
values
to
the
practical
activity
do
not
exist
indeed
none
exist
for
any
sort
of
activity
since
every
science
presupposes
that
activity
to
be
already
realized
and
developed
which
it
afterwards
takes
as
its
object
sidenote
of
the
practical
from
the
these
distinctions
established
we
must
condemn
as
erroneous
every
theory
which
annexes
the
æsthetic
activity
to
the
practical
or
introduces
the
laws
of
the
second
into
the
first
that
science
is
theory
and
art
practice
has
been
many
times
affirmed
those
who
make
this
statement
and
look
upon
the
æsthetic
fact
as
a
practical
fact
do
not
do
so
capriciously
or
because
they
are
groping
in
the
void
but
because
they
have
their
eye
on
something
which
is
really
practical
but
the
practical
which
they
aim
is
not
æsthetic
nor
within
æsthetic
it
is
and
beside
and
although
often
found
united
they
are
not
united
necessarily
or
by
the
bond
of
identity
of
nature
the
æsthetic
fact
is
altogether
completed
in
the
expressive
elaboration
of
impressions
when
we
have
achieved
the
word
within
us
conceived
definitely
and
vividly
a
figure
or
a
statue
or
found
a
musical
motive
expression
is
born
and
is
complete
there
is
no
need
for
anything
else
if
after
this
we
should
open
our
to
open
them
to
speak
or
our
throats
to
sing
that
is
to
say
utter
by
word
of
mouth
and
audible
melody
what
we
have
completely
said
or
sung
to
ourselves
or
if
we
should
stretch
to
stretch
out
our
hands
to
touch
the
notes
of
the
piano
or
to
take
up
the
brush
and
chisel
thus
making
on
a
large
scale
movements
which
we
have
already
made
in
little
and
rapidly
in
a
material
in
which
we
leave
more
or
less
durable
traces
this
is
all
an
addition
a
fact
which
obeys
quite
different
laws
from
the
former
with
which
we
are
not
concerned
for
the
moment
although
we
recognize
henceforth
that
this
second
movement
is
a
production
of
things
a
fact
or
fact
of
it
is
usual
to
distinguish
the
internal
from
the
external
work
of
art
the
terminology
seems
to
us
infelicitous
for
the
work
of
art
the
æsthetic
work
is
always
and
what
is
called
is
no
longer
a
work
of
art
others
distinguish
between
fact
and
fact
meaning
by
the
second
the
external
or
practical
stage
which
may
follow
and
generally
does
follow
the
first
but
in
this
case
it
is
simply
a
question
of
a
linguistic
usage
doubtless
permissible
though
perhaps
not
advisable
sidenote
of
the
theory
of
the
end
of
art
and
of
the
choice
of
for
the
same
reasons
the
search
for
the
of
is
ridiculous
when
it
is
understood
of
art
as
art
and
since
to
fix
an
end
is
to
choose
the
theory
that
the
content
of
art
must
be
is
another
form
of
the
same
error
a
selection
among
impressions
and
sensations
implies
that
these
are
already
expressions
otherwise
how
could
a
selection
be
made
among
the
continuous
and
indistinct
to
choose
is
to
will
to
will
this
and
not
to
will
that
and
this
and
that
must
be
before
us
expressed
practice
follows
it
does
not
precede
theory
expression
is
free
inspiration
the
true
artist
in
fact
finds
himself
big
with
his
theme
he
knows
not
how
he
feels
the
moment
of
birth
drawing
near
but
he
can
not
will
it
or
not
will
it
if
he
were
to
wish
to
act
in
opposition
to
his
inspiration
to
make
an
arbitrary
choice
if
born
anacreon
he
should
wish
to
sing
of
atreus
and
of
alcides
his
lyre
would
warn
him
of
his
mistake
sounding
only
of
venus
and
of
love
notwithstanding
his
efforts
to
the
contrary
sidenote
innocence
of
the
theme
or
content
can
not
therefore
be
practically
or
morally
charged
with
epithets
of
praise
or
blame
when
critics
of
art
remark
that
a
theme
is
selected
in
cases
where
that
observation
has
a
just
foundation
it
is
a
question
of
blaming
not
the
selection
of
the
theme
which
would
be
absurd
but
the
manner
in
which
the
artist
has
treated
it
the
failure
of
the
expression
due
to
the
contradictions
which
it
contains
and
when
the
same
critics
object
to
the
theme
or
content
of
works
which
they
proclaim
to
be
artistically
perfect
as
being
unworthy
of
art
and
blameworthy
if
these
expressions
really
are
perfect
there
is
nothing
to
be
done
but
to
advise
the
critics
to
leave
the
artists
in
peace
for
they
can
only
derive
inspiration
from
what
has
moved
their
soul
they
should
rather
direct
their
attention
towards
effecting
changes
in
surrounding
nature
and
society
that
such
impressions
and
states
of
soul
should
not
recur
if
ugliness
were
to
vanish
from
the
world
if
universal
virtue
and
felicity
were
established
there
perhaps
artists
would
no
longer
represent
perverse
or
pessimistic
feelings
but
calm
innocent
and
joyous
feelings
arcadians
of
a
real
arcady
but
so
long
as
ugliness
and
turpitude
exist
in
nature
and
impose
themselves
upon
the
artist
to
prevent
the
expression
of
these
things
also
is
impossible
and
when
it
has
arisen
infectum
fieri
we
speak
thus
entirely
from
the
æsthetic
point
of
view
and
of
pure
criticism
of
art
we
are
not
concerned
to
estimate
the
damage
which
the
criticism
of
choice
does
to
artistic
production
with
the
prejudices
which
it
produces
or
maintains
among
the
artists
themselves
and
with
the
conflict
to
which
it
gives
rise
between
artistic
impulse
and
critical
demands
it
is
true
that
sometimes
it
seems
also
to
do
some
good
by
aiding
artists
to
discover
themselves
that
is
their
own
impressions
and
their
own
inspiration
and
to
acquire
consciousness
of
the
task
which
is
as
it
were
imposed
upon
them
by
the
historical
moment
in
which
they
live
and
by
their
individual
temperament
in
these
cases
criticism
of
choice
while
believing
that
it
generates
merely
recognizes
and
aids
the
expressions
which
are
already
being
formed
it
believes
itself
to
be
the
mother
where
at
most
it
is
only
the
midwife
sidenote
independence
of
the
impossibility
of
choice
of
content
completes
the
theorem
of
the
of
art
and
is
also
the
only
legitimate
meaning
of
the
expression
for
art
art
is
independent
both
of
science
and
of
the
useful
and
the
moral
there
should
be
no
fear
lest
frivolous
or
cold
art
should
thus
be
justified
since
what
is
truly
frivolous
or
cold
is
so
because
it
has
not
been
raised
to
expression
or
in
other
words
frivolity
and
frigidity
come
always
from
the
form
of
the
æsthetic
treatment
from
failure
to
grasp
a
content
not
from
the
material
qualities
of
the
content
itself
sidenote
of
the
saying
the
style
is
the
the
saying
style
is
the
can
also
not
be
completely
criticized
save
by
starting
from
the
distinction
between
the
theoretic
and
the
practical
and
from
the
theoretic
character
of
the
æsthetic
activity
man
is
not
simply
knowledge
and
contemplation
he
is
will
which
contains
the
cognitive
moment
in
itself
hence
the
saying
is
either
altogether
void
as
when
it
is
taken
to
mean
that
the
style
is
the
man
style
is
the
man
that
is
but
only
so
far
as
he
is
expressive
activity
or
it
is
erroneous
as
when
the
attempt
is
made
to
deduce
what
a
man
has
done
and
willed
from
what
he
has
seen
and
expressed
thereby
asserting
that
there
is
a
logical
connexion
between
knowing
and
willing
many
legends
in
the
biographies
of
artists
have
sprung
from
this
erroneous
identification
since
it
seemed
impossible
that
a
man
who
gives
expression
to
generous
feelings
should
not
be
a
noble
and
generous
man
in
practical
life
or
that
the
dramatist
whose
plays
are
full
of
stabbing
should
not
himself
have
done
a
little
stabbing
in
real
life
artists
protest
vainly
est

they
are
merely
taxed
in
addition
with
lying
and
hypocrisy
how
far
more
prudent
you
were
poor
women
of
verona
when
you
founded
your
belief
that
dante
had
really
descended
to
hell
upon
his
blackened
countenance
yours
was
at
any
rate
a
historical
conjecture
sidenote
of
the
concept
of
sincerity
in
finally
imposed
as
a
duty
upon
the
artist
a
law
of
ethics
also
said
to
be
a
law
of
æsthetic
rests
upon
another
double
meaning
for
by
sincerity
may
be
meant
in
the
first
place
the
moral
duty
not
to
deceive
one
neighbour
and
in
that
case
it
is
foreign
to
the
artist
for
indeed
he
deceives
no
one
since
he
gives
form
to
what
is
already
in
his
soul
he
would
only
deceive
if
he
were
to
betray
his
duty
as
an
artist
by
failing
to
execute
his
task
in
its
essential
nature
if
lies
and
deceit
are
in
his
soul
then
the
form
which
he
gives
to
these
things
can
not
be
deceit
or
lies
precisely
because
it
is
æsthetic
if
the
artist
be
a
charlatan
a
liar
or
a
miscreant
he
purifies
his
other
self
by
reflecting
it
in
art
if
by
sincerity
be
meant
in
the
second
place
fulness
and
truth
of
expression
it
is
clear
that
this
second
sense
has
no
relation
to
the
ethical
concept
the
law
called
both
ethical
and
æsthetic
reveals
itself
here
as
nothing
but
a
word
used
both
by
ethics
and
æsthetic
vii
analogy
between
the
theoretic
and
the
practical
sidenote
two
forms
of
the

the
double
degree
of
the
theoretical
activity
æsthetic
and
logical
has
an
important
parallel
in
the
practical
activity
which
has
not
yet
been
placed
in
due
relief
the
practical
activity
is
also
divided
into
a
first
and
second
degree
the
second
implying
the
first
the
first
practical
degree
is
the

the

the

economy
is
as
it
were
the
æsthetic
of
practical
life
morality
its
logic
sidenote
economically
if
this
has
not
been
clearly
seen
by
philosophers
if
the
correct
place
in
the
system
of
the
spirit
has
not
been
given
to
the
economic
activity
if
it
has
been
left
to
wander
about
in
the
prolegomena
to
treatises
on
political
economy
often
vague
and
but
little
developed
this
is
due
among
other
reasons
to
the
fact
that
the
useful
or
economic
has
been
confused
sometimes
with
the
concept
of
the
sometimes
with
that
of
the
sidenote
between
the
useful
and
the
is
certainly
not
a
special
activity
of
the
spirit
technique
is
knowledge
or
rather
it
is
knowledge
itself
in
general
which
takes
this
name
when
it
serves
as
basis
as
we
have
seen
it
does
for
practical
action
knowledge
which
is
not
followed
or
is
supposed
not
to
be
easily
followed
by
practical
action
is
called
pure
the
same
knowledge
if
effectively
followed
by
action
is
called
applied
if
it
is
supposed
that
it
can
be
easily
followed
by
a
particular
action
it
is
called
applicable
or
technical
this
word
then
indicates
a
in
which
knowledge
is
or
may
easily
be
not
a
special
form
of
knowledge
so
true
is
this
that
it
would
be
altogether
impossible
to
establish
whether
a
given
order
of
knowledge
were
intrinsically
pure
or
applied
all
knowledge
however
abstract
and
philosophical
it
may
be
believed
to
be
may
be
a
guide
to
practical
acts
a
theoretical
error
in
the
ultimate
principles
of
morality
may
be
reflected
and
always
in
some
way
is
reflected
in
practical
life
one
can
only
speak
roughly
and
unscientifically
of
certain
truths
as
pure
and
of
others
as
applied
the
same
knowledge
that
is
called
technical
may
also
be
called
but
the
word
in
conformity
with
the
criticism
of
judgements
of
value
made
above
is
to
be
understood
as
used
here
in
a
verbal
or
metaphorical
sense
when
we
say
that
water
is
useful
for
putting
out
fire
the
word
useful
is
used
in
a
sense
water
thrown
on
the
fire
is
the
cause
of
its
going
out
this
is
the
knowledge
that
serves
for
basis
to
the
action
let
us
say
of
firemen
there
is
a
link
not
of
nature
but
of
simple
succession
between
the
useful
action
of
the
person
who
extinguishes
the
conflagration
and
that
knowledge
the
technique
of
the
effects
of
the
water
is
the
theoretical
activity
which
precedes
the
only
useful
thing
is
the
of
the
man
who
extinguishes
the
fire
sidenote
of
the
useful
from
the
some
economists
identify
utility
that
is
to
say
merely
economic
action
or
will
with
the
that
is
to
say
with
what
is
profitable
to
the
individual
in
so
far
as
individual
without
regard
to
and
indeed
in
complete
opposition
to
the
moral
law
the
egoistic
is
the
immoral
in
this
case
economics
would
be
a
very
strange
science
standing
not
beside
but
opposite
ethics
like
the
devil
facing
god
or
at
least
like
the
in
the
processes
of
canonization
such
a
conception
is
altogether
inadmissible
the
science
of
immorality
is
implied
in
that
of
morality
as
the
science
of
the
false
is
implied
in
logic
science
of
the
true
and
a
science
of
unsuccessful
expression
in
æsthetic
science
of
successful
expression
if
then
economics
were
the
scientific
treatment
of
egoism
it
would
be
a
chapter
of
ethics
or
ethics
itself
because
every
moral
determination
implies
at
the
same
time
a
negation
of
its
contrary
further
conscience
tells
us
that
to
conduct
oneself
economically
is
not
to
conduct
oneself
egoistically
that
even
the
most
morally
scrupulous
man
must
conduct
himself
usefully
economically
if
he
does
not
wish
to
act
at
hazard
and
consequently
in
a
manner
quite
the
reverse
of
moral
if
utility
were
egoism
how
could
it
be
the
duty
of
the
altruist
to
behave
like
an
egoist
sidenote
will
and
moral
if
we
are
not
mistaken
the
difficulty
is
solved
in
a
manner
perfectly
analogous
to
that
in
which
is
solved
the
problem
of
the
relations
between
expression
and
concept
æsthetic
and
logic
to
will
economically
is
to
an
end
to
will
morally
is
to
the
rational
but
whoever
wills
and
acts
morally
can
not
but
will
and
act
usefully
economically
how
could
he
will
the
end
unless
he
also
willed
it
his
particular
sidenote
the
converse
is
not
true
as
it
is
not
true
in
æsthetic
science
that
the
expressive
fact
must
of
necessity
be
linked
with
the
logical
fact
it
is
possible
to
will
economically
without
willing
morally
and
it
is
possible
to
conduct
oneself
with
perfect
economic
coherence
while
pursuing
an
end
which
is
objectively
irrational
immoral
or
rather
an
end
which
would
be
held
to
be
so
at
a
higher
grade
of
consciousness
examples
of
the
economic
without
the
moral
character
are
machiavelli
hero
cæsar
borgia
or
the
iago
of
shakespeare
who
can
help
admiring
their
strength
of
will
although
their
activity
is
only
economic
and
is
developed
in
opposition
to
what
we
hold
moral
who
can
help
admiring
the
ser
ciappelletto
of
boccaccio
who
pursues
and
realizes
his
ideal
of
the
perfect
rascal
even
on
his
making
the
petty
and
timid
little
thieves
who
are
present
at
his
burlesque
confession
exclaim
what
manner
of
man
is
this
whose
perversity
neither
age
nor
infirmity
nor
the
fear
of
death
which
he
sees
at
hand
nor
the

before
whose

a
little
while

otherwise

as

economic
side
of
the
moral
man

the
pertinacity
and
fearlessness
of

the

or
rather
good
will
would
not
be
will
and
consequently
not
good
if
it
did
not
possess
in
addition
to
the
side
which
makes
it
also
that
which
makes
it
so
a
logical
thought
which
does
not
succeed
in
expressing
itself
is
not
thought
but
at
the
most
a
confused
presentiment
of
a
thought
beyond
yet
to
come
it
is
not
correct
then
to
conceive
of
the
amoral
man
as
also
or
to
make
of
morality
an
element
of
coherence
in
the
acts
of
life
and
therefore
of
economicity
nothing
prevents
us
from
conceiving
an
hypothesis
which
is
verified
at
least
during
certain
periods
and
moments
if
not
during
whole
lifetimes
a
man
altogether
without
moral
conscience
in
a
man
thus
organized
what
for
us
is
immorality
is
not
so
for
him
because
it
is
not
felt
as
such
the
consciousness
of
the
contradiction
between
what
is
desired
as
a
rational
end
and
what
is
pursued
egoistically
can
not
arise
in
him
this
contradiction
is
immoral
conduct
becomes
also
only
in
the
man
who
possesses
moral
conscience
the
moral
remorse
which
is
the
indication
of
this
is
also
economical
remorse
that
is
to
say
sorrow
at
not
having
known
how
to
will
completely
and
to
attain
that
moral
ideal
which
was
willed
at
first
instead
of
allowing
himself
to
be
led
astray
by
the
passions
meliora
proboque
deteriora
the
and
the
are
here
an
initial
immediately
contradicted
and
overthrown
in
the
man
without
moral
sense
we
must
admit
a
remorse
that
is
like
that
of
a
thief
or
of
an
assassin
who
when
on
the
point
of
robbing
or
of
assassinating
should
abstain
from
doing
so
not
owing
to
a
conversion
of
his
being
but
to
nervousness
and
bewilderment
or
even
to
a
momentary
awakening
of
moral
consciousness
when
he
has
come
back
to
himself
such
a
thief
or
assassin
will
regret
and
be
ashamed
of
his
incoherence
his
remorse
will
not
be
due
to
having
done
wrong
but
to
having
done
wrong
it
is
therefore
economic
not
moral
since
the
latter
is
excluded
by
hypothesis
but
since
a
lively
moral
consciousness
is
generally
found
among
the
majority
of
men
and
its
total
absence
is
a
rare
and
perhaps
monstrosity
it
may
be
admitted
that
morality
in
general
coincides
with
economicity
in
the
conduct
of
life
sidenote
merely
economic
and
the
error
of
the
morally
there
need
be
no
fear
lest
the
parallelism
that
we
support
should
introduce
afresh
into
science
the
category
of
the
indifferent
of
that
which
is
in
truth
action
and
volition
but
is
neither
moral
nor
immoral
the
category
in
short
of
the
and
of
the
which
has
always
been
the
cause
or
reflexion
of
ethical
corruption
as
was
the
case
with
jesuitical
morality
which
it
dominated
it
remains
quite
certain
that
indifferent
moral
actions
do
not
exist
because
moral
activity
pervades
and
must
pervade
every
least
volitional
movement
of
man
but
far
from
upsetting
the
established
parallelism
this
confirms
it
are
there
by
any
chance
intuitions
which
science
and
the
intellect
do
not
pervade
and
analyse
resolving
them
into
universal
concepts
or
changing
them
into
historical
affirmations
we
have
already
seen
that
true
science
philosophy
knows
no
external
limits
which
bar
its
way
as
happens
with
the
natural
sciences
science
and
morality
entirely
dominate
the
one
the
æsthetic
intuitions
the
other
the
economic
volitions
of
man
although
neither
of
them
can
appear
in
the
concrete
save
the
one
in
the
intuitive
the
other
in
the
economic
form
sidenote
of
utilitarianism
and
the
reform
of
ethics
and
of
this
combined
identity
and
difference
of
the
useful
and
the
moral
of
the
economic
and
the
ethical
explains
the
success
at
the
present
time
and
formerly
of
the
utilitarian
theory
of
ethics
indeed
it
is
easy
to
discover
and
to
illustrate
a
utilitarian
side
in
every
moral
action
as
it
is
easy
to
reveal
the
æsthetic
side
in
every
logical
proposition
the
criticism
of
ethical
utilitarianism
can
not
begin
by
denying
this
truth
and
seeking
out
absurd
and
examples
of
moral
actions
it
must
admit
the
utilitarian
side
and
explain
it
as
the
concrete
form
of
morality
which
consists
in
this
that
it
is
this
form
utilitarians
do
not
see
this
inside
this
is
not
the
place
for
the
fuller
development
that
such
ideas
deserve
ethics
and
economics
can
not
however
fail
to
be
gainers
as
we
have
said
of
logic
and
æsthetic
by
a
more
exact
determination
of
the
relations
that
exist
between
them
economic
science
is
now
rising
to
the
activistical
concept
of
the
useful
as
it
attempts
to
surpass
the
mathematical
phase
in
which
it
is
still
entangled
a
phase
which
was
in
its
turn
a
progress
when
it
superseded
historicism
or
the
confusion
of
the
theoretical
with
the
historical
and
destroyed
a
number
of
capricious
distinctions
and
false
economic
theories
with
this
conception
it
will
be
easy
on
the
one
hand
to
absorb
and
to
verify
the
theories
of
pure
economics
and
on
the
other
by
the
introduction
of
successive
complications
and
additions
to
effect
a
transition
from
the
philosophical
to
the
empirical
or
naturalistic
method
and
thus
to
embrace
the
particular
theories
expounded
in
the
political
or
national
economy
of
the
schools
sidenote
and
noumenon
in
practical
as
æsthetic
intuition
knows
the
phenomenon
or
nature
and
the
philosophic
concept
the
noumenon
or
spirit
so
the
economic
activity
wills
the
phenomenon
or
nature
and
the
moral
activity
the
noumenon
or
spirit
spirit
which
wills
itself
its
true
self
the
universal
which
is
in
the
empirical
and
finite
spirit
that
is
the
formula
which
perhaps
defines
the
essence
of
morality
with
the
least
impropriety
this
will
for
the
true
self
is
viii
exclusion
of
other
spiritual
forms
in
this
summary
sketch
that
we
have
given
of
the
entire
philosophy
of
the
spirit
in
its
fundamental
moments
the
spirit
is
thus
conceived
as
consisting
of
four
moments
or
degrees
disposed
in
such
a
way
that
the
theoretical
activity
is
to
the
practical
as
the
first
theoretical
degree
is
to
the
second
theoretical
and
the
first
practical
degree
to
the
second
practical
the
four
moments
imply
one
another
regressively
by
their
concreteness
the
concept
can
not
exist
without
expression
the
useful
without
both
and
morality
without
the
three
preceding
degrees
if
the
æsthetic
fact
is
in
a
certain
sense
alone
independent
while
the
others
are
more
or
less
dependent
then
the
logical
is
the
least
dependent
and
the
moral
will
the
most
moral
intention
acts
on
given
theoretic
bases
with
which
it
can
not
dispense
unless
we
are
willing
to
accept
that
absurd
procedure
known
to
the
jesuits
as
of
intention
in
which
people
pretend
to
themselves
not
to
know
what
they
know
only
too
well
sidenote
forms
of
sidenote
system
of
the
if
the
forms
of
human
activity
are
four
four
also
are
the
forms
of
men
endowed
with
genius
in
art
in
science
and
in
moral
will
or
heroes
have
always
been
recognized
but
the
genius
of
pure
economicity
has
met
with
repugnance
it
is
not
altogether
without
reason
that
a
category
of
bad
geniuses
or
of
of
has
been
created
the
practical
merely
economic
genius
which
is
not
directed
to
a
rational
end
can
not
but
excite
an
admiration
mingled
with
alarm
to
dispute
as
to
whether
the
word
genius
should
be
applied
only
to
creators
of
æsthetic
expression
or
also
to
men
of
scientific
research
and
of
action
would
be
a
mere
question
of
words
to
observe
on
the
other
hand
that
genius
of
whatever
kind
it
be
is
always
a
quantitative
conception
and
an
empirical
distinction
would
be
to
repeat
what
has
already
been
explained
as
regards
artistic
genius
sidenote
of
a
fifth
form
of
activity
law
a
fifth
form
of
spiritual
activity
does
not
exist
it
would
be
easy
to
show
how
all
the
other
forms
either
do
not
possess
the
character
of
activity
or
are
verbal
variants
of
the
activities
already
examined
or
are
complex
and
derivative
facts
in
which
the
various
activities
are
mingled
and
are
filled
with
particular
and
contingent
contents
the
fact
for
example
considered
as
what
is
called
objective
law
is
derived
both
from
the
economic
and
from
the
logical
activities
law
is
a
rule
a
formula
whether
oral
or
written
matters
little
here
in
which
is
fixed
an
economic
relation
willed
by
an
individual
or
by
a
community
and
this
economic
side
at
once
unites
it
with
and
distinguishes
it
from
moral
activity
take
another
example
sociology
among
the
many
meanings
the
word
bears
in
our
times
is
sometimes
conceived
as
the
study
of
an
original
element
which
is
called
now
what
is
it
that
distinguishes
sociability
or
the
relations
which
are
developed
in
a
meeting
of
men
and
not
in
a
meeting
of
beings
if
it
be
not
just
the
various
spiritual
activities
which
exist
among
the
former
and
which
are
supposed
not
to
exist
or
to
exist
only
in
a
rudimentary
degree
among
the
latter
sociability
then
far
from
being
an
original
simple
irreducible
conception
is
very
complex
and
complicated
a
proof
of
this
would
be
the
impossibility
generally
recognized
of
enunciating
a
single
law
which
could
be
described
as
purely
sociological
those
that
are
improperly
so
called
are
shown
to
be
either
empirical
historical
observations
or
spiritual
laws
that
is
to
say
judgements
into
which
the
conceptions
of
the
spiritual
activities
are
translated
when
they
are
not
simply
empty
and
indeterminate
generalities
like
the
law
of
evolution
sometimes
too
nothing
more
is
understood
by
sociability
than
social
rule
and
so
law
thus
confounding
sociology
with
the
science
or
theory
of
law
itself
law
sociability
and
similar
concepts
are
to
be
dealt
with
in
a
mode
analogous
to
that
employed
by
us
in
the
consideration
and
analysis
of
historicity
and
technique
sidenote
it
may
seem
that
activity
should
be
judged
otherwise
but
religion
is
nothing
but
knowledge
and
does
not
differ
from
its
other
forms
and
for
it
is
in
turn
either
the
expression
of
practical
aspirations
and
ideals
religious
ideals
or
historical
narrative
legend
or
conceptual
science
dogma
it
can
therefore
be
maintained
with
equal
truth
either
that
religion
is
destroyed
by
the
progress
of
human
knowledge
or
that
it
is
always
present
there
their
religion
was
the
whole
intellectual
patrimony
of
primitive
peoples
our
intellectual
patrimony
is
our
religion
the
content
has
been
changed
bettered
refined
and
it
will
change
and
become
better
and
more
refined
in
the
future
also
but
its
form
is
always
the
same
we
do
not
know
what
use
could
be
made
of
religion
by
those
who
wish
to
preserve
it
side
by
side
with
the
theoretic
activity
of
man
with
his
art
with
his
criticism
and
with
his
philosophy
it
is
impossible
to
preserve
an
imperfect
and
inferior
kind
of
knowledge
such
as
religion
side
by
side
with
what
has
surpassed
and
disproved
it
catholicism
which
is
always
consistent
will
not
tolerate
a
science
a
history
an
ethics
in
contradiction
to
its
views
and
doctrines
the
rationalists
are
less
coherent
they
are
disposed
to
allow
a
little
space
in
their
souls
for
a
religion
in
contradiction
with
their
whole
theoretic
world
the
religious
affectations
and
weaknesses
prevalent
among
the
rationalists
of
our
time
have
their
origin
in
the
superstitious
worship
so
recklessly
lavished
upon
the
natural
sciences
we
know
ourselves
and
their
chief
representatives
admit
that
these
sciences
are
all
surrounded
by
science
having
been
wrongly
identified
with
the
natural
sciences
it
could
be
foreseen
that
the
remainder
would
be
sought
in
religion
that
remainder
with
which
the
human
spirit
can
not
dispense
we
are
therefore
indebted
to
materialism
to
positivism
to
naturalism
for
this
unhealthy
and
often
disingenuous
recrudescence
of
religious
exaltation
which
belongs
to
the
hospital
when
it
does
not
belong
to
the
politician
sidenote
philosophy
removes
from
religion
all
reason
for
existing
because
it
substitutes
itself
for
religion
as
the
science
of
the
spirit

looks
upon
religion
as
a
phenomenon
a
transitory
historical
fact
a
psychic
condition
that
can
be
surpassed

shares
the
domain
of
knowledge
with
the
natural
sciences

with

the
first

and

chronicling
of
what
has
individually
happened
to
the
third

individually
possible
there
is
nothing
left
to
allot
to
religion
for
the
same
reason
philosophy
as
the
science
of
the
spirit
can
not
be
philosophy
of
the
intuitive
datum
nor
as
has
been
seen
of
history
nor
of
and
therefore
there
can
not
be
a
philosophical
science
of
what
is
not
form
and
universal
but
material
and
particular
this
amounts
to
affirming

impossibility

supplanted

called

of

seeing
that
the
function
of
art
is
a
necessary
degree
of
the
spirit
to
ask
if
art
can
be
eliminated
is
the

as
to
ask
if
sensation

intelligence
can
be

metaphysic
in
the
above
sense
transplanting
itself
into
an
arbitrary
world
is
not
to
be
criticized
in
its
particulars
any
more
than
we
can
criticize
the
botany
of
the
garden
of
alcina
or
the
navigation
of
the
voyage
of
astolfo
criticism
can
only
exist
when
we
refuse
to
join
in
the
game
that
is
to
say
when
we
reject
the
very
possibility
of
metaphysic
always
in
the
sense
above
indicated
there
is
therefore
no
intellectual
intuition
in
philosophy
as
there
is
no
surrogate
or
equivalent
of
it
in

or
any
other
mode
by
which
this
imaginary

may

may

ourselves

or
supreme

otherwise

and

of

sidenote
characters
of

is
customary
to
give
long
catalogues
of
the
of
art
having
reached
this
point
of
the
treatise
after
having
studied
art
as
spiritual
activity
as
theoretic
activity
and
as
special
theoretic
activity
intuitive
we
are
able
to
discover
that
those
varied
and
numerous
determinations
of
characters
where
they
refer
to
anything
real
do
nothing
but
represent
what
we
have
already
met
with
as
genera
species
and
individuality
of
the
æsthetic
form
to
the
generic
are
reducible
as
we
have
already
observed
the

or
rather
the
verbal
variants
of
and
of

and
so
on
to
the

of

the

to
the

the
characters
of
of

of
of
of

may
change
again
but
they
will
not
contribute
anything
scientifically
new
the
analysis
of
expression
as
such
is
completely
effected
in
the
results
expounded
above
sidenote
of
modes
of
it
might
on
the
other
hand
be
asked
at
this
point
if
there
be
or
of
expression
if
having
distinguished
two
degrees
of
activity
of
the
spirit
each
of
which
is
subdivided
into
two
other
degrees
one
of
these
the
is
not
in
its
turn
subdivided
into
two
or
more
intuitive
modes
into
a
first
second
or
third
degree
of
expression
but
this
further
division
is
impossible
a
classification
of
is
certainly
permissible
but
is
not
philosophical
individual
expressive
facts
are
so
many
individuals
not
one
of
which
is
interchangeable
with
another
save
in
its
common
quality
of
expression
to
employ
the
language
of
the
schools
expression
is
a
species
which
can
not
function
in
its
turn
as
a
genus
impressions
or
contents
vary
every
content
differs
from
every
other
content
because
nothing
repeats
itself
in
life
and
the
irreducible
variety
of
the
forms
of
expression
corresponds
to
the
continual
variation
of
the
contents
the
æsthetic
synthesis
of
impressions
sidenote
of
a
corollary
of
this
is
the
impossibility
of
in
so
far
as
they
pretend
to
effect
the
of
one
expression
into
another
like
a
liquid
poured
from
a
vase
of
a
certain
shape
into
a
vase
of
another
shape
we
can
elaborate
logically
what
we
have
already
elaborated
in
æsthetic
form
only
but
we
can
not
reduce
what
has
already
possessed
its
æsthetic
form
to
another
form
also
æsthetic
indeed
every
translation
either
diminishes
and
spoils
or
it
creates
a
new
expression
by
putting
the
former
back
into
the
crucible
and
mingling
it
with
the
personal
impressions
of
the
translator
in
the
former
case
the
expression
always
remains
one
that
of
the
original
the
translation
being
more
or
less
deficient
that
is
to
say
not
properly
expression
in
the
other
case
there
would
certainly
be
two
expressions
but
with
two
different
contents
faithful
ugliness
or
faithless
beauty
is
a
proverb
that
well
expresses
the
dilemma
with
which
every
translator
is
faced
translations
such
as
those
that
are
word
for
word
or
paraphrastic
are
to
be
looked
upon
as
simple
commentaries
upon
the
original
sidenote
of
the
rhetorical
the
illegitimate
division
of
expressions
into
various
grades
is
known
in
literature
by
the
name
of
doctrine
of
or
of
but
similar
attempts
at
distinctions
in
other
artistic
groups
are
not
wanting
suffice
it
to
recall
the
and
forms
so
often
mentioned
in
relation
to
painting
and
sculpture
and
and
and
and
and
the
fourteen
forms
of
metaphor
the
figures
of
and
pleonasm
ellipse
inversion
repetition
and
these
and
all
other
determinations
of
modes
or
degrees
of
expression
reveal
their
philosophical
nullity
when
the
attempt
is
made
to
develop
them
in
precise
definitions
because
they
either
grasp
the
void
or
fall
into
the
absurd
a
typical
example
of
this
is
the
very
common
definition
of
metaphor
as
of
word
used
in
place
of
the
proper
now
why
give
oneself
this
trouble
why
substitute
the
improper
for
the
proper
word
why
take
the
worse
and
longer
road
when
you
know
the
shorter
and
better
road
perhaps
as
is
commonly
said
because
the
proper
word
is
in
certain
cases
not
so
as
the
improper
word
or
metaphor
but
if
this
be
so
the
metaphor
is
exactly
the
proper
word
in
that
case
and
the
proper
word
if
it
were
used
would
be
and
therefore
most
improper
similar
observations
of
elementary
good
sense
can
be
made
regarding
the
other
categories
as
for
example
the
general
one
of
the
here
for
instance
it
may
be
asked
how
an
ornament
can
be
joined
to
expression
externally
in
that
case
it
is
always
separated
from
the
expression
internally
in
that
case
either
it
does
not
assist
the
expression
and
mars
it
or
it
does
form
part
of
it
and
is
not
an
ornament
but
a
constituent
element
of
the
expression
indivisible
and
indistinguishable
in
its
unity
it
is
needless
to
say
how
much
harm
has
been
done
by
rhetorical
distinctions
rhetoric
has
often
been
declaimed
against
but
although
there
has
been
rebellion
against
its
consequences
its
principles
have
at
the
same
time
been
carefully
preserved
perhaps
in
order
to
show
proof
of
philosophic
consistency
in
literature
the
rhetorical
categories
have
contributed
if
not
to
make
dominant
at
least
to
justify
theoretically
that
particular
kind
of
which
is
called
or
writing
according
to
rhetoric
sidenote
of
these
categories
as
synonyms
of
the
æsthetic
the
terms
above
mentioned
would
never
have
gone
beyond
the
schools
where
we
all
of
us
learned
them
only
we
never
found
an
opportunity
of
using
them
in
strictly
æsthetic
discussions
or
at
most
of
doing
so
jocosely
and
with
a
comic
intention
were
it
not
that
they
can
sometimes
be
employed
in
one
of
the
following
significations
as
of
the
æsthetic
concept
as
indications
of
the
or
finally
and
this
is
their
most
important
use
no
longer
in
the
service
of
art
and
æsthetic
but
of
and
sidenote
sense
of
the
rhetorical
expressions
considered
directly
or
positively
are
not
divisible
into
classes
but
some
are
successful
others
others
failures
there
are
perfect
and
imperfect
successful
and
unsuccessful
expressions
the
words
recorded
and
others
of
the
same
sort
may
therefore
sometimes
indicate
the
successful
expression
and
the
various
forms
of
the
failures
but
they
do
this
in
the
most
inconstant
and
capricious
manner
so
much
so
that
the
same
word
serves
sometimes
to
proclaim
the
perfect
sometimes
to
condemn
the
imperfect
for
example
some
will
say
of
two
pictures
one
without
inspiration
in
which
the
author
has
copied
natural
objects
without
intelligence
the
other
inspired
but
without
close
relation
to
existing
objects
that
the
first
is
the
second
others
on
the
contrary
utter
the
word
before
a
picture
strongly
felt
representing
a
scene
of
ordinary
life
while
they
apply
that
of
to
another
picture
that
is
but
a
cold
allegory
it
is
evident
that
in
the
first
case
symbolic
means
artistic
and
realistic
inartistic
while
in
the
second
realistic
is
synonymous
with
artistic
and
symbolic
with
inartistic
what
wonder
then
that
some
hotly
maintain
the
true
art
form
is
the
symbolic
and
that
the
realistic
is
inartistic
others
that
the
realistic
is
artistic
and
the
symbolic
inartistic
we
can
not
but
grant
that
both
are
right
since
each
uses
the
same
words
in
such
a
different
sense
the
great
disputes
about
and
were
frequently
based
upon
such
equivocations
sometimes
the
former
was
understood
as
the
artistically
perfect
and
the
second
as
lacking
balance
and
imperfect
at
others
classic
meant
cold
and
artificial
romantic
pure
warm
powerful
truly
expressive
thus
it
was
always
possible
reasonably
to
take
the
side
of
the
classic
against
the
romantic
or
of
the
romantic
against
the
classic
the
same
thing
happens
as
regards
the
word
sometimes
it
is
said
that
every
writer
must
have
style
here
style
is
synonymous
with
form
of
expression
at
others
the
form
of
a
code
of
laws
or
of
a
mathematical
work
is
said
to
be
without
style
here
the
error
is
again
committed
of
admitting
diverse
modes
of
expression
an
ornate
and
a
naked
form
because
if
style
is
form
the
code
and
the
mathematical
treatise
must
also
be
asserted
strictly
speaking
to
have
each
its
style
at
other
times
one
hears
the
critics
blaming
some
one
for
having
too
much
style
or
for
writing
a
style
here
it
is
clear
that
style
signifies
not
the
form
nor
a
mode
of
it
but
improper
and
pretentious
expression
a
form
of
the
inartistic
sidenote
use
to
indicate
various
æsthetic
the
second
not
altogether
meaningless
use
of
these
words
and
distinctions
is
to
be
found
when
we
hear
in
the
examination
of
a
literal
composition
such
remarks
as
these
here
is
a
pleonasm
here
an
ellipse
there
a
metaphor
here
again
a
synonym
or
an
ambiguity
the
meaning
is
here
is
an
error
consisting
of
using
a
larger
number
of
words
than
necessary
pleonasm
here
on
the
other
hand
the
error
arises
from
too
few
having
been
used
ellipse
here
from
the
use
of
an
unsuitable
word
metaphor
here
of
two
words
which
seem
to
say
two
different
things
but
really
say
the
same
thing
synonym
here
on
the
contrary
of
one
word
which
seems
to
express
the
same
thing
whereas
it
says
two
different
things
ambiguity
this
depreciatory
and
pathological
use
of
the
terms
is
however
less
common
than
the
preceding
sidenote
use
in
a
sense
transcending
æsthetic
in
the
service
of
and
finally
when
rhetorical
terminology
possesses
no
æsthetic
signification
similar
or
analogous
to
those
passed
in
review
and
yet
one
feels
that
it
is
not
void
of
meaning
and
designates
something
that
deserves
to
be
noted
this
means
that
it
is
used
in
the
service
of
logic
and
of
science
granted
that
a
concept
used
by
a
writer
in
a
scientific
sense
is
designated
by
a
definite
term
it
is
natural
that
other
terms
found
in
use
by
that
writer
on
which
he
incidentally
employs
himself
to
signify
the
same
thought
become
respect
the
vocabulary
fixed
upon
by
him
as
true
metaphors
synecdoches
synonyms
elliptical
forms
and
the
like
we
ourselves
in
the
course
of
this
treatise
have
several
times
made
use
of
and
intend
again
to
make
use
of
such
language
in
order
to
make
clear
the
sense
of
the
words
we
employ
or
may
find
employed
but
this
proceeding
which
is
of
value
in
discussions
pertaining
to
the
criticism
of
science
and
philosophy
has
none
whatever
in
literary
and
artistic
criticism
there
are
words
and
metaphors
proper
to
science
the
same
concept
may
be
psychologically
formed
in
various
circumstances
and
therefore
differ
in
its
intuitional
expression
when
the
scientific
terminology
of
a
given
writer
has
been
established
and
one
of
these
modes
fixed
as
correct
then
all
other
uses
of
it
become
improper
or
tropical
but
in
the
æsthetic
fact
there
are
none
but
proper
words
the
same
intuition
can
be
expressed
in
one
way
only
precisely
because
it
is
intuition
and
not
concept
sidenote
in
the
some
while
admitting
the
æsthetic
of
the
rhetorical
categories
yet
make
a
reservation
as
to
their
utility
and
the
service
they
are
supposed
to
render
especially
in
schools
of
literature
we
confess
that
we
fail
to
understand
how
error
and
confusion
can
educate
the
mind
to
logical
distinction
or
aid
the
teaching
of
a
science
which
they
disturb
and
obscure
perhaps
what
is
meant
is
that
such
distinctions
as
empirical
classes
can
aid
memory
and
learning
as
was
admitted
above
for
literary
and
artistic
kinds
to
this
there
is
no
objection
there
is
certainly
another
purpose
for
which
the
rhetorical
categories
should
continue
to
appear
in
schools
to
be
criticized
there
the
errors
of
the
past
must
not
be
forgotten
and
no
more
said
and
truths
can
not
be
kept
alive
save
by
making
them
combat
errors
unless
an
account
of
the
rhetorical
categories
be
given
accompanied
by
a
criticism
of
them
there
is
a
risk
of
their
springing
up
again
and
it
may
be
said
that
they
are
already
springing
up
among
certain
philologists
as
the
latest
discoveries
sidenote
resemblances
of
it
might
seem
that
we
thus
wished
to
deny
all
bond
of
resemblance
between
different
expressions
and
works
of
art
resemblances
exist
and
by
means
of
them
works
of
art
can
be
arranged
in
this
or
that
group
but
they
are
likenesses
such
as
are
observed
among
individuals
and
can
never
be
rendered
with
abstract
determinations
that
is
to
say
it
would
be
incorrect
to
apply
identification
subordination
and
the
other
relations
of
concepts
to
these
resemblances
which
consist
wholly
of
what
is
called
a
likeness
derived
from
the
historical
conditions
in
which
the
various
works
have
appeared
and
from
relationship
of
soul
among
the
artists
sidenote
relative
possibility
of
it
is
in
these
resemblances
that
lies
the
possibility
of
translations
not
as
reproductions
of
the
same
original
expressions
which
it
would
be
vain
to
attempt
but
as
productions
of
expressions
more
or
less
nearly
resembling
the
originals
the
translation
called
good
is
an
approximation
which
has
original
value
as
a
work
of
art
and
can
stand
by
itself
x
æsthetic
feelings
and
the
distinction
between
the
beautiful
and
the
ugly
sidenote
significations
of
the
word
passing
to
the
study
of
more
complex
concepts
where
the
æsthetic
activity
is
to
be
considered
in
conjunction
with
other
orders
of
facts
and
showing
the
mode
of
their
union
or
complication
we
find
ourselves
first
face
to
face
with
the
concept
of
and
with
those
feelings
that
are
called
the
word
feeling
is
one
of
the
richest
in
meanings
in
philosophic
terminology
we
have
already
had
occasion
to
meet
with
it
once
among
those
used
to
designate
the
spirit
in
its
passivity
the
matter
or
content
of
art
and
so
as
synonym
of
once
again
and
then
the
meaning
was
altogether
different
we
have
met
with
it
as
designating
the
and
character
of
the
æsthetic
fact
that
is
to
say
pure
intuition
a
form
of
truth
which
defines
no
concept
and
affirms
no
fact
sidenote
as
but
here
it
is
not
regarded
in
either
of
these
two
meanings
nor
in
the
others
which
have
also
been
conferred
upon
it
to
designate
other
forms
of
the
spirit
but
only
in
that
where
feeling
is
understood
as
a
special
activity
of
nature
having
its
two
poles
positive
and
negative
in
and
this
activity
has
always
greatly
embarrassed
philosophers
who
have
therefore
attempted
either
to
deny
it
as
activity
or
to
attribute
it
to
excluding
it
from
the
spirit
but
both
these
solutions
bristle
with
difficulties
of
such
a
kind
as
to
prove
them
finally
unacceptable
to
any
one
who
examines
them
with
care
for
what
could
a
activity
ever
be
an
of
nature
when
we
have
no
other
knowledge
of
activity
save
as
spirituality
nor
of
spirituality
save
as
activity
nature
is
in
this
case
by
definition
the
merely
passive
inert
mechanical
material
on
the
other
hand
the
negation
of
the
character
of
activity
to
feeling
is
energetically
disproved
by
those
very
poles
of
pleasure
and
of
pain
which
appear
in
it
and
manifest
activity
in
its
concreteness
or
so
to
say
quivering
sidenote
of
feeling
with
economic
this
critical
conclusion
should
place
us
especially
in
the
greatest
embarrassment
for
in
the
sketch
of
the
system
of
the
spirit
given
above
we
have
left
no
room
for
the
new
activity
of
which
we
are
now
obliged
to
recognize
the
existence
but
the
activity
of
feeling
if
it
is
activity
is
not
new
it
has
already
had
its
place
assigned
to
it
in
the
system
that
we
have
sketched
where
however
it
has
been
given
another
name
activity
what
is
called
the
activity
of
feeling
is
nothing
but
that
more
elementary
and
fundamental
practical
activity
which
we
have
distinguished
from
the
ethical
activity
and
made
to
consist
of
the
appetition
and
volition
for
some
individual
end
apart
from
any
moral
determination
if
feeling
has
been
sometimes
considered
to
be
an
organic
or
natural
activity
this
has
happened
just
because
it
does
not
coincide
either
with
logical
æsthetic
or
ethical
activity
looked
at
from
the
standpoint
of
those
three
which
were
the
only
ones
admitted
it
has
seemed
to
lie
the
true
and
real
spirit
spirit
in
its
aristocracy
and
to
be
almost
a
determination
of
nature
or
of
the
soul
in
so
far
as
it
is
nature
from
this
too
results
the
truth
of
another
thesis
often
maintained
that
the
æsthetic
activity
like
the
ethical
and
intellectual
activities
is
not
feeling
this
thesis
is
inexpugnable
when
feeling
has
already
been
understood
implicitly
and
unconsciously
as
economic
volition
sidenote
of
the
view
refuted
in
this
thesis
is
known
as
this
consists
in
reducing
all
the
various
forms
of
the
spirit
to
one
which
thus
also
loses
its
own
distinctive
character
and
becomes
something
obscure
and
mysterious
like
the
night
in
which
all
cows
are
black
having
brought
about
this
reduction
and
mutilation
the
hedonists
naturally
do
not
succeed
in
seeing
anything
else
in
any
activity
but
pleasure
and
pain
they
find
no
substantial
difference
between
the
pleasure
of
art
and
that
of
easy
digestion
between
the
pleasure
of
a
good
action
and
that
of
breathing
the
fresh
air
with
lungs
sidenote
as
a
concomitant
of
every
form
of
but
if
the
activity
of
feeling
in
the
sense
here
defined
must
not
be
substituted
for
all
the
other
forms
of
spiritual
activity
we
have
not
said
that
it
can
not
them
indeed
it
accompanies
them
of
necessity
because
they
are
all
in
close
relation
both
with
one
another
and
with
the
elementary
volitional
form
therefore
each
of
them
has
for
concomitants
individual
volitions
and
volitional
pleasures
and
pains
known
as
feeling
but
we
must
not
confound
a
concomitant
with
the
principal
fact
and
substitute
the
one
for
the
other
the
discovery
of
a
truth
or
the
fulfilment
of
a
moral
duty
produces
in
us
a
joy
which
makes
vibrate
our
whole
being
which
by
attaining
the
aim
of
those
forms
of
spiritual
activity
attains
at
the
same
time
that
to
which
it
was
tending
as
its
end
nevertheless
or
satisfaction
satisfaction
satisfaction
satisfaction
though
thus
united
remain
always
distinct
a
question
often
asked
is
thus
answered
at
the
same
time
one
which
has
correctly
seemed
to
be
a
matter
of
life
or
death
for
æsthetic
science
namely
whether
feeling
and
pleasure
precede
or
follow
are
cause
or
effect
of
the
æsthetic
fact
we
must
widen
this
question
to
include
the
relation
between
the
various
spiritual
forms
and
answer
it
by
maintaining
that
one
can
not
talk
of
cause
and
effect
and
of
a
chronological
before
and
after
in
the
unity
of
the
spirit
and
once
the
relation
above
expounded
is
established
all
necessity
for
inquiry
as
to
the
nature
of
æsthetic
moral
intellectual
and
even
what
was
sometimes
called
economic
feelings
must
disappear
in
this
last
case
it
is
clear
that
it
is
a
question
not
of
two
terms
but
of
one
and
inquiry
as
to
economic
feeling
must
be
the
same
as
that
relating
to
economic
activity
but
in
the
other
cases
also
we
must
attend
not
to
the
substantive
but
to
the
adjective
the
æsthetic
moral
and
logical
character
will
explain
the
colouring
of
the
feelings
as
æsthetic
moral
and
intellectual
whereas
feeling
studied
alone
will
never
explain
those
refractions
and
colorations
sidenote
of
certain
ordinary
distinctions
of
a
further
consequence
is
that
we
no
longer
need
retain
the
distinctions
between
values
or
feelings
value
and
feelings
that
are
merely
hedonistic
and
and
feelings
feelings
and
feelings
not
but
simply
feelings
of
and
of
cf
the
distinction
of
and
in
german
those
distinctions
were
used
to
save
the
three
spiritual
forms
which
were
recognized
as
the
triad
of
the
the
and
the
from
confusion
with
the
fourth
form
still
unknown
and
therefore
insidious
in
its
indeterminateness
and
mother
of
scandals
for
us
this
triad
has
completed
its
task
because
we
are
capable
of
reaching
the
distinction
far
more
directly
by
receiving
also
the
selfish
subjective
merely
pleasurable
feelings
among
the
respectable
forms
of
the
spirit
and
where
formerly
antitheses
were
conceived
by
ourselves
and
others
between
value
and
feelings
as
between
spirituality
and
naturality
henceforth
we
see
nothing
but
differences
between
value
and
value
sidenote
and
disvalue
the
contraries
and
their
as
has
already
been
said
feeling
or
the
economic
activity
presents
itself
as
divided
into
two
poles
positive
and
negative
pleasure
and
pain
which
we
can
now
translate
into
useful
and
disuseful
or
hurtful
this
bipartition
has
already
been
noted
above
as
a
mark
of
the
activistic
character
of
feeling
and
one
which
is
to
be
found
in
all
forms
of
activity
if
each
of
these
is
each
has
opposed
to
it
or
absence
of
value
is
not
sufficient
to
cause
dis
value
but
activity
and
passivity
must
be
struggling
between
themselves
without
the
one
getting
the
better
of
the
other
hence
the
contradiction
and
disvalue
of
the
activity
that
is
embarrassed
impeded
or
interrupted
value
is
activity
that
unfolds
itself
freely
disvalue
is
its
contrary
we
will
content
ourselves
with
this
definition
of
the
two
terms
without
entering
into
the
problem
of
the
relation
between
value
and
disvalue
that
is
the
problem
of
contraries
that
is
to
say
whether
they
are
to
be
thought
of
dualistically
as
two
beings
or
two
orders
of
beings
like
ormuzd
and
ahriman
angels
and
devils
enemies
to
one
another
or
as
a
unity
which
is
also
contrariety
this
definition
of
the
two
terms
will
be
sufficient
for
our
purpose
which
is
to
make
clear
the
nature
of
æsthetic
activity
and
at
this
particular
point
one
of
the
most
obscure
and
disputed
concepts
of
æsthetic
the
concept
of
the
sidenote
beautiful
as
the
value
of
expression
or
expression
without
æsthetic
intellectual
economic
and
ethical
values
and
disvalues
are
variously
denominated
in
current
speech
true
good
useful
expedient
just
and
so
on
thus
designating
the
free
development
of
spiritual
activity
action
scientific
research
artistic
production
when
they
are
successful
false
bad
useless
inexpedient
unjust
wrong
designating
embarrassed
activity
the
product
that
is
a
failure
in
linguistic
usage
these
denominations
are
being
continually
shifted
from
one
order
of
facts
to
another
for
instance
is
said
not
only
of
a
successful
expression
but
also
of
a
scientific
truth
of
an
action
successfully
achieved
and
of
a
moral
action
thus
we
talk
of
an
beauty
of
a
action
of
a
the
attempt
to
keep
up
with
these
infinitely
varying
usages
leads
into
a
trackless
labyrinth
of
verbalism
in
which
many
philosophers
and
students
of
art
have
lost
their
way
for
this
reason
we
have
thought
it
best
studiously
to
avoid
the
use
of
the
word
beautiful
to
indicate
successful
expression
in
its
positive
value
but
after
all
the
explanations
that
we
have
given
all
danger
of
misunderstanding
being
now
dissipated
and
since
on
the
other
hand
we
can
not
fail
to
recognize
that
the
prevailing
tendency
both
in
current
speech
and
in
philosophy
is
to
limit
the
meaning
of
the
word
beautiful
precisely
to
the
æsthetic
value
it
seems
now
both
permissible
and
advisable
to
define
beauty
as
expression
or
rather
as
and
nothing
more
because
expression
when
it
is
not
successful
is
not
expression
sidenote
ugly
and
the
elements
of
beauty
which
compose
consequently
the
ugly
is
unsuccessful
expression
the
paradox
is
true
for
works
of
art
that
are
failures
that
the
beautiful
presents
itself
as
the
ugly
as
hence
we
hear
of
in
relation
to
works
of
art
that
are
more
or
less
failures
that
is
to
say
of
parts
of
them
that
are
beautiful
which
is
not
the
case
with
perfect
works
it
is
in
fact
impossible
to
enumerate
the
merits
or
to
point
out
what
parts
of
the
latter
are
beautiful
because
being
a
complete
fusion
they
have
but
one
value
life
circulates
in
the
whole
organism
it
is
not
withdrawn
into
the
several
parts
sidenote
that
there
exist
expressions
neither
beautiful
nor
unsuccessful
works
may
have
merit
in
various
degrees
even
the
greatest
the
beautiful
does
not
possess
degrees
for
there
is
no
conceiving
a
more
beautiful
that
is
an
expressive
that
is
more
expressive
an
adequate
that
is
more
than
adequate
ugliness
on
the
other
hand
does
possess
degrees
from
the
rather
ugly
or
almost
beautiful
to
the
extremely
ugly
but
if
the
ugly
were
that
is
to
say
without
any
element
of
beauty
it
would
for
that
very
reason
cease
to
be
ugly
because
it
would
be
without
the
contradiction
in
which
is
the
reason
of
its
existence
the
disvalue
would
become
activity
would
give
place
to
passivity
with
which
it
is
not
at
war
save
when
activity
is
really
present
to
oppose
it
and
because
the
distinctive
consciousness
of
the
beautiful
and
of
the
ugly
is
based
on
the
conflicts
and
contradictions
in
which
æsthetic
activity
is
developed
it
is
evident
that
this
consciousness
becomes
attenuated
to
the
point
of
disappearing
altogether
as
we
descend
from
the
more
complicated
to
the
more
simple
and
to
the
simplest
instances
of
expression
hence
the
illusion
that
there
are
expressions
neither
beautiful
nor
ugly
those
which
are
obtained
without
sensible
effort
and
appear
easy
and
natural
being
considered
such
sidenote
æsthetic
feelings
and
concomitant
or
accidental
the
whole
mystery
of
the
and
the
is
reduced
to
these
henceforth
most
easy
definitions
should
any
one
object
that
there
exist
perfect
æsthetic
expressions
before
which
no
pleasure
is
felt
and
others
perhaps
even
failures
which
give
him
the
greatest
pleasure
we
must
recommend
him
to
concentrate
his
attention
in
the
æsthetic
fact
upon
that
which
is
truly
æsthetic
pleasure
æsthetic
pleasure
is
sometimes
reinforced
or
rather
complicated
by
pleasures
arising
from
extraneous
facts
which
are
only
accidentally
found
united
with
it
the
poet
or
any
other
artist
affords
an
instance
of
purely
æsthetic
pleasure
at
the
moment
when
he
sees
or
intuites
his
work
for
the
first
time
that
is
to
say
when
his
impressions
take
form
and
his
countenance
is
irradiated
with
the
divine
joy
of
the
creator
on
the
other
hand
a
mixed
pleasure
is
experienced
by
one
who
goes
to
the
theatre
after
a
day
work
to
witness
a
comedy
when
the
pleasure
of
rest
and
amusement
or
that
of
laughingly
snatching
a
nail
from
his
coffin
accompanies
the
moment
of
true
æsthetic
pleasure
in
the
art
of
the
dramatist
and
actors
the
same
may
be
said
of
the
artist
who
looks
upon
his
labour
with
pleasure
when
it
is
finished
experiencing
in
addition
to
the
æsthetic
pleasure
that
very
different
one
which
arises
from
the
thought
of
satisfied
or
even
of
the
economic
gain
which
will
come
to
him
from
his
work
instances
could
be
multiplied
sidenote
of
apparent
a
category
of
æsthetic
feelings
has
been
formed
in
modern
æsthetic
not
arising
from
the
form
that
is
to
say
from
the
works
of
art
as
such
but
from
their
content
it
has
been
remarked
that
artistic
representations
arouse
pleasure
and
pain
in
their
infinite
shades
of
variety
we
tremble
with
anxiety
we
rejoice
we
fear
we
laugh
we
weep
we
desire
with
the
personages
of
a
drama
or
of
a
romance
with
the
figures
in
a
picture
and
with
the
melody
of
music
but
these
feelings
are
not
such
as
would
be
aroused
by
the
real
fact
outside
art
or
rather
they
are
the
same
in
quality
but
are
quantitatively
an
attenuation
of
real
things
æsthetic
and
pleasure
and
pain
show
themselves
to
be
light
shallow
mobile
we
have
no
need
to
treat
here
of
these
feelings
for
the
good
reason
that
we
have
already
amply
discussed
them
indeed
we
have
hitherto
treated
of
nothing
but
them
what
are
these
apparent
or
manifested
feelings
but
feelings
objectified
intuited
expressed
and
it
is
natural
that
they
do
not
trouble
and
afflict
us
as
passionately
as
those
of
real
life
because
those
were
matter
these
are
form
and
activity
those
true
and
proper
feelings
these
intuitions
and
expressions
the
formula
of
is
therefore
for
us
nothing
but
a
tautology
through
which
we
can
run
the
pen
without
scruple
xi
criticism
of
æsthetic
hedonism
as
we
are
opposed
to
hedonism
in
general
that
is
to
say
to
the
theory
based
upon
the
pleasure
and
pain
intrinsic
to
the
economic
activity
and
accompanying
every
other
form
of
activity
which
confounding
container
and
content
fails
to
recognize
any
process
but
the
hedonistic
so
we
are
opposed
to
æsthetic
hedonism
in
particular
which
looks
at
any
rate
upon
the
æsthetic
if
not
also
upon
all
other
activities
as
a
simple
fact
of
feeling
and
confounds
the
pleasurable
expression
which
is
the
beautiful
with
the
simply
pleasurable
and
all
its
other
species
sidenote
of
the
beautiful
as
that
which
pleases
the
higher
the
point
of
view
has
been
presented
in
several
forms
one
of
the
most
ancient
conceives
the
beautiful
as
that
which
pleases
sight
and
hearing
that
is
to
say
the
when
analysis
of
æsthetic
facts
first
began
it
was
indeed
difficult
to
avoid
the
false
belief
that
a
picture
and
a
piece
of
music
are
impressions
of
sight
or
hearing
and
correctly
to
interpret
the
obvious
remark
that
the
blind
man
does
not
enjoy
the
picture
nor
the
deaf
man
the
music
to
show
as
we
have
shown
that
the
æsthetic
fact
does
not
depend
upon
the
nature
of
the
impressions
but
that
all
sensible
impressions
can
be
raised
to
æsthetic
expression
and
that
none
need
of
necessity
be
so
raised
is
an
idea
which
presents
itself
only
when
all
other
doctrinal
constructions
of
this
problem
have
been
tried
any
one
who
holds
that
the
æsthetic
fact
is
something
pleasing
to
the
eyes
or
to
the
hearing
has
no
line
of
defence
against
him
who
consistently
proceeds
to
identify
the
beautiful
with
the
pleasurable
in
general
and
includes
in
æsthetic
cooking
or
as
some
positivists
have
called
it
the
viscerally
beautiful
sidenote
of
the
theory
of
the
theory
of
is
another
form
of
æsthetic
hedonism
the
concept
of
play
has
sometimes
helped
towards
the
realization
of
the
activistic
character
of
the
expressive
fact
man
it
has
been
said
is
not
really
man
save
when
he
begins
to
play
that
is
to
say
when
he
frees
himself
from
natural
and
mechanical
causality
and
works
spiritually
and
his
first
game
is
art
but
since
the
word
play
also
means
that
pleasure
which
arises
from
the
expenditure
of
the
exuberant
energy
of
the
organism
which
is
a
practical
fact
the
consequence
of
this
theory
has
been
that
every
game
has
been
called
an
æsthetic
fact
or
that
the
æsthetic
function
has
been
called
a
game
because
like
science
and
everything
else
it
may
form
part
of
a
game
morality
alone
can
not
ever
be
caused
by
the
will
to
play
for
it
will
never
consent
to
such
an
origin
but
on
the
contrary
itself
dominates
and
regulates
the
act
itself
of
playing
sidenote
of
the
theories
of
sexuality
and
of
finally
some
have
tried
to
deduce
the
pleasure
of
art
from
the
echo
of
that
of
the
sexual
organs
and
some
of
the
most
recent
æstheticians
confidently
find
the
genesis
of
the
æsthetic
fact
in
the
pleasure
of
and
in
that
of
or
as
others
add
in
the
wish
of
the
male
to
conquer
the
female
this
theory
is
seasoned
with
much
anecdotal
erudition
heaven
knows
of
what
degree
of
credibility
as
to
the
customs
of
savage
peoples
but
there
was
really
no
need
for
such
assistance
since
in
ordinary
life
one
often
meets
poets
who
adorn
themselves
with
their
poetry
like
cocks
raising
their
crests
or
turkeys
spreading
out
their
tails
but
any
one
who
does
this
in
so
far
as
he
does
it
is
not
a
poet
but
a
poor
fool
in
fact
a
poor
fool
of
a
cock
or
turkey
and
the
desire
for
the
victorious
conquest
of
women
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
fact
of
art
it
would
be
just
as
correct
to
look
upon
poetry
as
because
there
once
were
court
poets
and
salaried
poets
and
there
are
poets
now
who
find
in
the
sale
of
their
verses
an
aid
to
life
if
not
a
complete
living
this
deduction
and
definition
has
not
failed
to
attract
some
zealous
neophytes
in
historical
materialism
sidenote
of
the
æsthetic
of
the
sympathetic
meaning
in
it
of
content
and
another
less
vulgar
current
of
thought
considers
æsthetic
as
the
science
of
the
as
that
with
which
we
sympathize
which
attracts
rejoices
arouses
pleasure
and
admiration
but
the
sympathetic
is
nothing
but
the
image
or
representation
of
what
pleases
and
as
such
it
is
a
complex
fact
resulting
from
a
constant
element
the
æsthetic
element
of
representation
and
a
variable
element
the
pleasing
in
its
infinite
forms
arising
from
all
the
various
classes
of
values
in
ordinary
language
there
is
sometimes
a
feeling
of
repugnance
at
calling
an
expression
beautiful
unless
it
is
an
expression
of
the
sympathetic
hence
the
continual
conflicts
between
the
point
of
view
of
the
æsthetician
or
art
critic
and
that
of
the
ordinary
person
who
can
not
succeed
in
persuading
himself
that
the
image
of
pain
and
baseness
can
be
beautiful
or
at
least
that
it
has
as
much
right
to
be
beautiful
as
the
pleasing
and
the
good
the
conflict
could
be
put
an
end
to
by
distinguishing
two
different
sciences
one
of
expression
and
the
other
of
the
sympathetic
if
the
latter
could
be
the
object
of
a
special
science
that
is
to
say
if
it
were
not
as
has
been
shown
a
complex
and
equivocal
concept
if
predominance
be
given
to
the
expressive
fact
it
enters
æsthetic
as
science
of
expression
if
to
the
pleasurable
content
we
fall
back
to
the
study
of
facts
essentially
hedonistic
utilitarian
however
complicated
they
may
appear
the
particular
origin
of
the
doctrine
which
conceives
the
relation
between
form
and
content
as
the
sum
of
two
values
is
also
to
be
sought
in
the
doctrine
of
the
sympathetic
sidenote
hedonism
and
in
all
the
doctrines
just
now
discussed
art
is
considered
as
a
merely
hedonistic
thing
but
æsthetic
hedonism
can
not
be
maintained
save
by
uniting
it
with
a
general
philosophical
hedonism
which
does
not
admit
any
other
form
of
value
hardly
has
this
hedonistic
conception
of
art
been
received
by
philosophers
who
admit
one
or
more
spiritual
values
truth
or
morality
when
the
following
question
must
necessarily
be
asked
what
must
be
done
with
art
to
what
use
should
it
be
put
should
a
free
course
be
allowed
to
the
pleasures
it
procures
and
if
so
to
what
extent
the
question
of
the
of
art
which
in
the
æsthetic
of
expression
is
inconceivable
has
a
clear
significance
in
the
æsthetic
of
the
sympathetic
and
demands
a
solution
sidenote
rigoristic
negation
and
the
pedagogic
justification
of
now
it
is
evident
that
such
solution
can
have
but
two
forms
one
altogether
negative
the
other
of
a
restrictive
nature
the
first
which
we
shall
call
or
appears
several
times
although
not
frequently
in
the
history
of
ideas
it
looks
upon
art
as
an
inebriation
of
the
senses
and
therefore
as
not
only
useless
but
harmful
according
to
this
theory
then
we
must
exert
all
our
strength
to
liberate
the
human
soul
from
its
disturbing
influence
the
other
solution
which
we
shall
call
or
admits
art
but
only
in
so
far
as
it
with
the
end
of
morality
in
so
far
as
it
assists
with
innocent
pleasure
the
work
of
him
who
points
the
way
to
the
true
and
the
good
in
so
far
as
it
anoints
the
edge
of
the
cup
of
wisdom
and
morality
with
sweet
honey
it
is
well
to
observe
that
it
would
be
an
error
to
divide
this
second
view
into
intellectualistic
and
according
as
to
whether
be
assigned
to
art
the
end
of
leading
to
the
true
or
to
what
is
practically
good
the
educational
task
which
is
imposed
upon
it
precisely
because
it
is
an
end
which
is
sought
after
and
advised
is
no
longer
merely
a
theoretical
fact
but
a
theoretical
fact
already
become
the
ground
for
practical
action
it
is
not
therefore
intellectualism
but
pedagogism
and
practicism
nor
would
it
be
more
exact
to
subdivide
the
pedagogic
view
into
pure
utilitarian
and
because
those
who
admit
only
the
satisfaction
of
the
individual
the
desire
of
the
individual
precisely
because
they
are
absolute
hedonists
have
no
motive
for
seeking
an
ulterior
justification
for
art
but
to
enunciate
these
theories
at
the
point
to
which
we
have
attained
is
to
confute
them
we
prefer
to
restrict
ourselves
to
observing
that
in
the
pedagogic
theory
of
art
is
to
be
found
another
of
the
reasons
why
the
claim
has
erroneously
been
made
that
the
content
of
art
should
be
with
a
view
to
certain
practical
effects
sidenote
of
pure
the
thesis
that
art
consists
of
has
often
been
brought
forward
against
hedonistic
and
pedagogic
æsthetic
and
eagerly
taken
up
by
artists
heaven
places
all
our
joy
in
beauty
and
the
verse
is
everything
if
by
this
be
understood
that
art
is
not
to
be
confounded
with
sensual
pleasure
utilitarian
practicism
nor
with
the
exercise
of
morality
then
our
æsthetic
also
must
be
permitted
to
adorn
itself
with
the
title
of
of
pure
but
if
as
is
often
the
case
something
mystical
and
transcendent
be
meant
by
this
something
unknown
to
our
poor
human
world
or
something
spiritual
and
beatific
but
not
expressive
we
must
reply
that
while
applauding
the
conception
of
a
beauty
from
all
that
is
not
the
spiritual
form
of
expression
we
are
unable
to
conceive
a
beauty
superior
to
this
and
still
less
that
it
should
be
of

severed

itself

assumes

fortuitously
treated

by
the

authors
in

books
has
introduced

rendered
familiar

a

the

can

since
that

took
the

as
its

it
was
naturally
unable

neglect
any
of
the

of
the

starting
from
the

in

manifestation
its
contrary
the
antipathetic

is
finally
reached

constituted

in

of
the
overcoming
of
having
enumerated
and
defined
as
well
as
it
could
the
chief
of
these
varieties
the
æsthetic
of
the
sympathetic
set
itself
the
problem
of
the
place
to
be
assigned
to
the
in
this
problem
is
without
meaning
for
us
who
do
not
recognize
any
ugliness
save
the
or
inexpressive
which
can
never
form
of
the
æsthetic
fact
being
on
the
contrary
its
but
in
the
doctrine
which
we
are
here
criticizing
the
positing
and
discussion
of
that
problem
meant
neither
more
nor
less
than
the
necessity
of
reconciling
in
some
way
the
false
and
defective
idea
of
art
from
which
it
started
art
reduced
to
the
representation
of
the
pleasurable
with
real
art
which
occupies
a
far
wider
field
hence
the
artificial
attempt
to
settle
what
examples
of
the
antipathetic
could
be
admitted
in
artistic
representation
and
for
what
reasons
and
in
what
ways
the
answer
was
that
the
ugly
is
admissible
only
when
it
can
be
an
unconquerable
ugliness
such
as
the
or
the
being
altogether
excluded
further
that
the
duty
of
the
ugly
when
admitted
in
art
is
to
contribute
towards
heightening
the
effect
of
the
beautiful
sympathetic
by
producing
a
series
of
contrasts
from
which
the
pleasurable
may
issue
more
efficacious
and
it
is
indeed
a
common
observation
that
pleasure
is
more
vividly
felt
when
preceded
by
abstinence
and
suffering
thus
the
ugly
in
art
was
looked
upon
as
adapted
for
the
service
of
the
beautiful
a
stimulant
and
condiment
of
æsthetic
pleasure
that
special
refinement
of
hedonistic
theory
which
used
to
be
pompously
called
the
doctrine
of
the
of
the
falls
with
the
æsthetic
of
the
sympathetic
and
with
it
the
enumeration
and
definition
of
the
concepts
mentioned
above
which
show
themselves
to
be
completely
foreign
to
æsthetic
for
æsthetic
does
not
recognize
the
sympathetic
or
the
antipathetic
or
their
varieties
but
only
the
spiritual
activity
of
representation
sidenote
concepts
belong
to
nevertheless
the
important
place
which
as
we
have
said
those
concepts
have
hitherto
occupied
in
æsthetic
treatises
makes
it
advisable
to
supply
a
rather
more
complete
explanation
as
to
their
nature
what
shall
be
their
lot
excluded
from
æsthetic
in
what
other
part
of
philosophy
will
they
be
received
in
truth
nowhere
for
all
those
concepts
are
without
philosophical
value
they
are
nothing
but
a
series
of
classes
which
can
be
fashioned
in
the
most
various
ways
and
multiplied
at
pleasure
to
which
it
is
sought
to
reduce
the
infinite
complications
and
shadings
of
the
values
and
disvalues
of
life
of
these
classes
some
have
an
especially
positive
significance
like
the
beautiful
the
sublime
the
majestic
the
solemn
the
serious
the
weighty
the
noble
the
elevated
others
a
significance
chiefly
negative
like
the
ugly
the
painful
the
horrible
the
dreadful
the
tremendous
the
monstrous
the
insipid
the
extravagant
finally
in
others
a
mixed
significance
prevails
such
as
the
comic
the
tender
the
melancholy
the
humorous
the
the
complications
are
infinite
because
the
individuations
are
infinite
hence
it
is
not
possible
to
construct
the
concepts
save
in
the
arbitrary
and
approximate
manner
proper
to
the
natural
sciences
satisfied
with
making
the
best
classification
they
can
of
that
reality
which
they
can
neither
exhaust
by
enumeration
nor
understand
and
conquer
speculatively
and
since
is
the
naturalistic
science
which
undertakes
to
construct
types
and
schemes
of
the
spiritual
life
of
man
a
science
whose
merely
empirical
and
descriptive
character
becomes
more
evident
day
by
day
these
concepts
do
not
belong
to
æsthetic
nor
to
philosophy
in
general
but
must
simply
be
handed
over
to
psychology
sidenote
of
rigorous
definitions
of
the
case
of
those
concepts
is
that
of
all
other
psychological
constructions
no
rigorous
definitions
of
them
are
possible
and
consequently
they
can
not
be
deduced
from
one
another
nor
be
connected
in
a
system
though
this
has
often
been
attempted
with
great
waste
of
time
and
without
obtaining
thereby
any
useful
results
nor
can
it
be
claimed
as
possible
to
obtain
empirical
definitions
universally
acceptable
as
precise
and
true
in
the
place
of
those
philosophical
definitions
recognized
as
impossible
for
no
single
definition
of
a
single
fact
can
be
given
but
there
are
innumerable
definitions
of
it
according
to
the
cases
and
the
purposes
for
which
they
are
made
and
it
is
clear
that
if
there
were
only
one
which
had
the
value
of
truth
it
would
no
longer
be
an
empirical
but
a
rigorous
and
philosophical
definition
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
whenever
one
of
the
terms
to
which
we
have
referred
has
been
employed
or
indeed
any
other
belonging
to
the
same
class
a
new
definition
of
it
has
been
given
at
the
same
time
expressed
or
understood
each
one
of
those
definitions
differed
somehow
from
the
others
in
some
particular
however
minute
and
in
its
implied
reference
to
some
individual
fact
or
other
which
thus
became
a
special
object
of
attention
and
was
raised
to
the
position
of
a
general
type
thus
it
is
that
not
one
of
such
definitions
satisfies
either
the
hearer
or
the
constructor
of
it
for
a
moment
later
he
finds
himself
before
a
new
instance
to
which
he
recognizes
that
his
definition
is
more
or
less
insufficient
and
in
need
of
retouching
so
we
must
leave
writers
and
speakers
free
to
define
the
sublime
or
the
comic
the
tragic
or
the
humorous
on
every
occasion
as
they
please
and
as
may
suit
the
end
they
have
in
view
and
if
an
empirical
definition
of
universal
validity
be
demanded
we
can
but
submit
this
one
the
sublime
or
comic
tragic
humorous
etc
is
that
is
or
shall
be
so
by
those
who
have
employed
or
shall
employ
these
sidenote
definitions
of
the
sublime
the
comic
the
what
is
the
sublime
the
unexpected
affirmation
of
an
overwhelming
moral
force
that
is
one
definition
but
the
other
definition
is
equally
good
which
recognizes
the
sublime
also
where
the
force
which
affirms
itself
is
certainly
overwhelming
but
immoral
and
destructive
both
remain
vague
and
lack
precision
until
applied
to
a
concrete
case
to
an
example
which
makes
clear
what
is
meant
by
overwhelming
and
what
by
unexpected
they
are
quantitative
concepts
but
falsely
quantitative
since
there
is
no
way
of
measuring
them
they
are
at

emphatic
phrases
or

tautologies

of
this
or
that
poem
which
in
its
uniqueness
is
its
own
definition
and
though
momentary
and
circumscribed
is
alone
adequate
the
comic
has
been
defined
as
the
displeasure
arising
from
the
perception
of
a
deformity
immediately
followed
by
a
greater
pleasure
arising
from
the
relaxation
of
our
psychical
forces
strained
in
expectation
of
a
perception
looked
upon
as
important
while
listening
to

narrative

might
for
example
be
a
description
of
the
magnificently
heroic
purpose
of
some
individual
we
anticipate
in
imagination
the
occurrence
of
a
magnificent
and
heroic
action
and
we
prepare
for
its
reception
by
concentrating
our
psychic
forces
all
of
a
sudden
however
instead
of
the
magnificent
and
heroic
action
which
the
preliminaries
and
the
tone
of
the
narrative
had
led
us
to
expect
there
is
an
unexpected
change
to
a
small
mean
foolish
action
which
does
not
satisfy
to
our
expectation
we
have
been
deceived
and
the
recognition
of
the
deceit
brings
with
it
an
instant
of
displeasure
but
this
instant
is
as
it
were
conquered
by
that
which
immediately
follows
we
are
able
to
relax
our
strained
attention
to
free
ourselves
from
the
provision
of
accumulated
psychic
energy
henceforth
superfluous
to
feel
ourselves
light
and
well
this
is
the
pleasure
of
the
comic
with
its
physiological
equivalent
of
laughter
if
the
unpleasant
fact
that
has
appeared
should
painfully
affect
our
interests
there
would
not
be
pleasure
laughter
would
be
at
once
suffocated
the
psychic
energy
would
be
strained
and
overstrained
by
other
more
weighty
perceptions
if
on
the
other
hand
such
more
weighty
perceptions
do
not
appear
if
the
whole
loss
be
limited
to
a
slight
deception
of
our
foresight
then
the
feeling
of
our
psychic
wealth
that
ensues
affords
ample
compensation
for
this
very
slight
disappointment
such
expressed
in
a
few
words
is
one
of
the
most
accurate
modern
definitions
of
the
comic
it
boasts
of
containing
in
itself
justified
or
corrected
and
verified
the
manifold
attempts
to
define
the
comic
from
hellenic
antiquity
to
our
own
day
from
plato
definition
in
the
and
from
aristotle
which
is
more
explicit
and
looks
upon
the
comic
as
an
without
pain
to
that
of
hobbes
who
replaced
it
in
the
feeling
of
of
kant
who
saw
in
it
the
of
a
or
from
the
other
proposals
of
those
for
whom
it
was
conflict
between
great
and
small
between
the
finite
and
the
and
so
on
but
on
close
observation
the
analysis
and
definition
above
given
although
in
appearance
most
elaborate
and
precise
yet
enunciates
characteristics
which
are
applicable
not
only
to
the
comic
but
to
every
spiritual
process
such
as
the
succession
of
painful
and
pleasing
moments
and
the
satisfaction
arising
from
the
consciousness
of
strength
and
of
its
free
expansion
the
differentiation
is
here
given
by
quantitative
determinations
whose
limits
can
not
be
laid
down
they
therefore
remain
vague
words
possessing
some
degree
of
meaning
from
their
reference
to
this
or
that
particular
comic
fact
and
from
the
psychic
disposition
of
qualities
of
the
speaker
if
such
definitions
be
taken
too
seriously
there
happens
to
them
what
jean
paul
richter
said
of
all
the
definitions
of
the
comic
namely
that
their
sole
merit
is
be
themselves
and
to
produce
in
reality
the
fact
which
they
vainly
try
to
fix
logically
and
who
will
ever
logically
determine
the
dividing
line
between
the
comic
and
the
between
laughter
and
smiles
between
smiling
and
gravity
or
cut
the
ever
varying
continuum
into
which
life
melts
into
clearly
divided
parts
sidenote
between
these
concepts
and
æsthetic
the
facts
classified
as
far
as
possible
in
these
psychological
concepts
bear
no
relation
to
the
artistic
fact
beyond
the
general
one
that
all
of
them
in
so
far
as
they
constitute
the
material
of
life
can
become
the
object
of
artistic
representation
and
the
other
an
accidental
relation
that
æsthetic
facts
also
may
sometimes
enter
the
processes
described
such
as
the
impression
of
the
sublime
aroused
by
the
work
of
a
titanic
artist
such
as
dante
or
shakespeare
and
of
the
comic
produced
by
the
attempts
of
a
dauber
or
scribbler
but
here
too
the
process
is
external
to
the
æsthetic
fact
to
which
is
linked
only
the
feeling
of
æsthetic
value
and
disvalue
of
the
beautiful
and
of
the
ugly
dante
farinata
is
æsthetically
beautiful
and
nothing
but
beautiful
if
the
force
of
will
of
that
personage
seem
also
sublime
or
the
expression
that
dante
gives
him
seem
by
reason
of
his
great
genius
sublime
in
comparison
with
that
of
a
less
energetic
poet
these
are
things
altogether
outside
æsthetic
consideration
we
repeat
again
that
this
last
pays
attention
always
and
only
to
the
adequateness
of
the
expression
that
is
to
say
to
beauty
xiii
the
physically
beautiful
in
nature
and
in
art
sidenote
activity
and
physical
æsthetic
activity
distinct
from
the
practical
activity
is
always
accompanied
by
it
in
its
manifestations
hence
its
utilitarian
or
hedonistic
side
and
the
pleasure
and
pain
which
are
as
it
were
the
practical
echo
of
æsthetic
value
and
disvalue
of
the
beautiful
and
of
the
ugly
but
this
practical
side
of
the
æsthetic
activity
has
in
its
turn
a
or
accompaniment
which
consists
of
sounds
tones
movements
combinations
of
lines
and
colours
and
so
on
does
it
possess
this
side
or
does
it
only
seem
to
possess
it
through
the
construction
which
we
put
on
it
in
physical
science
and
the
useful
and
arbitrary
methods
which
we
have
already
several
times
set
in
relief
as
proper
to
the
empirical
and
abstract
sciences
our
reply
can
not
be
doubtful
that
is
it
must
affirm
to
the
second
of
the
two
hypotheses
however
it
will
be
better
to
leave
this
point
in
suspense
since
it
is
not
at
present
necessary
to
press
this
line
of
inquiry
further
the
mere
mention
suffices
to
secure
our
speaking
for
reasons
of
simplicity
and
adhesion
to
ordinary
language
of
the
physical
element
as
something
objective
and
existing
against
leading
to
hasty
conclusions
as
to
the
concepts
of
spirit
and
nature
and
their
relation
sidenote
in
the
æsthetic
sense
and
expression
in
the
naturalistic
it
is
important
on
the
other
hand
to
make
clear
that
as
the
existence
of
the
hedonistic
side
in
every
spiritual
activity
has
given
rise
to
the
confusion
between
the
æsthetic
activity
and
the
useful
or
pleasurable
so
the
existence
of
or
rather
the
possibility
of
constructing
this
physical
side
has
caused
the
confusion
between
expression
and
expression
a
naturalistic
that
is
to
say
between
a
spiritual
fact
and
a
mechanical
and
passive
fact
not
to
say
between
a
concrete
reality
and
an
abstraction
or
fiction
in
common
speech
sometimes
it
is
the
words
of
the
poet
that
are
called
the
notes
of
the
musician
or
the
figures
of
the
painter
sometimes
the
blush
which
generally
accompanies
the
feeling
of
shame
the
pallor
often
due
to
fear
the
grinding
of
the
teeth
proper
to
violent
anger
the
shining
of
the
eyes
and
certain
movements
of
the
muscles
of
the
mouth
which
manifest
cheerfulness
we
also
say
that
a
certain
degree
of
heat
is
the
of
fever
that
the
falling
of
the
barometer
is
the
of
rain
and
even
that
the
height
of
the
exchange
the
depreciation
of
the
paper
currency
of
a
state
or
social
discontent
the
approach
of
a
revolution
one
can
well
imagine
what
sort
of
scientific
results
would
be
attained
by
allowing
oneself
to
be
governed
by
verbal
usage
and
classing
together
facts
so
widely
different
but
there
is
in
fact
an
abyss
between
a
man
who
is
the
prey
of
anger
with
all
its
natural
manifestations
and
another
man
who
expresses
it
æsthetically
between
the
appearance
the
cries
and
contortions
of
some
one
grieving
at
the
loss
of
a
dear
one
and
the
words
or
song
with
which
the
same
individual
portrays
his
suffering
at
another
time
between
the
grimace
of
emotion
and
the
gesture
of
the
actor
darwin
book
on
the
expression
of
the
emotions
in
man
and
animals
does
not
belong
to
æsthetic
because
there
is
nothing
in
common
between
the
science
of
spiritual
expression
and
a
whether
it
be
medical
meteorological
political
physiognomic
or
chiromantic
expression
in
the
naturalistic
sense
simply
lacks
in
the
spiritual
sense
that
is
to
say
the
very
character
of
activity
and
of
spirituality
and
therefore
the
bipartition
into
the
poles
of
beauty
and
of
ugliness
it
is
nothing
but
a
relation
between
cause
and
effect
fixed
by
the
abstract
intellect
the
complete
process
of
æsthetic
production
can
be
symbolized
in
four
stages
which
are
impressions
expression
or
spiritual
æsthetic
synthesis
hedonistic
accompaniment
or
pleasure
of
the
beautiful
æsthetic
pleasure
translation
of
the
æsthetic
fact
into
physical
phenomena
sounds
tones
movements
combinations
of
lines
and
colours
any
one
can
see
that
the
capital
point
the
only
one
that
is
properly
speaking
æsthetic
and
truly
real
is
in
which
is
lacking
to
the
merely
naturalistic
manifestation
or
construction
also
metaphorically
called
expression
the
expressive
process
is
exhausted
when
these
four
stages
have
been
passed
through
it
begins
again
with
new
impressions
a
new
æsthetic
synthesis
and
the
accompaniments
that
belong
to
it
sidenote
and
expressions
or
representations
follow
one
another
the
one
drives
out
the
other
certainly
this
passing
away
this
being
driven
out
is
not
a
perishing
it
is
not
total
elimination
nothing
that
is
born
dies
with
that
complete
death
which
would
be
identical
with
never
having
been
born
if
all
things
pass
away
nothing
can
die
even
the
representations
that
we
have
forgotten
persist
somehow
in
our
spirit
for
without
this
we
could
not
explain
acquired
habits
and
capacities
indeed
the
strength
of
life
lies
in
this
apparent
forgetting
one
forgets
what
has
been
absorbed
and
what
life
has
superseded
but
other
representations
are
also
powerful
elements
in
the
present
processes
of
our
spirit
and
it
is
incumbent
upon
us
not
to
forget
them
or
to
be
capable
of
recalling
them
when
they
are
wanted
the
will
is
always
vigilant
in
this
work
of
preservation
which
aims
at
preserving
we
may
say
the
greater
the
more
fundamental
part
of
all
our
riches
but
its
vigilance
does
not
always
suffice
memory
as
we
say
abandons
or
betrays
us
in
different
ways
for
this
very
reason
the
human
spirit
devises
expedients
which
succour
the
weakness
of
memory
and
are
its
sidenote
production
of
aids
to
how
these
aids
are
possible
we
have
been
informed
from
what
has
been
said
expressions
or
representations
are
practical
facts
which
are
also
called
physical
in
so
far
as
physics
classifies
and
reduces
them
to
types
now
it
is
clear
that
if
we
can
succeed
in
making
those
practical
or
physical
facts
somehow
permanent
it
will
always
be
possible
all
other
conditions
remaining
equal
on
perceiving
them
to
reproduce
in
ourselves
the
already
produced
expression
or
intuition
if
that
be
called
the
object
or
physical
stimulus
in
which
the
practical
concomitant
acts
or
to
use
physical
terms
in
which
the
movements
have
been
isolated
and
made
in
some
sort
permanent
and
if
that
object
or
stimulus
be
designated
by
the
letter
the
process
of
reproduction
will
take
place
in
the
following
order
the
physical
stimulus
perception
of
physical
facts
sounds
tones
mimetic
combinations
of
lines
and
colours
etc
which
is
together
the
æsthetic
synthesis
already
produced
the
hedonistic
accompaniment
which
is
also
reproduced
and
what
else
are
those
combinations
of
words
called
poetry
prose
poems
novels
romances
tragedies
or
comedies
but
stimulants
of
the
stage
what
else
are
those
combinations
of
sound
called
operas
symphonies
sonatas
or
those
combinations
of
lines
and
colours
called
pictures
statues
architecture
the
spiritual
energy
of
memory
with
the
assistance
of
the
physical
facts
above
mentioned
makes
possible
the
preservation
and
the
reproduction
of
the
intuitions
produced
by
man
the
physiological
organism
and
with
it
the
memory
become
weakened
the
monuments
of
art
are
destroyed
and
lo
all
that
æsthetic
wealth
the
fruit
of
the
labours
of
many
generations
diminishes
and
rapidly
disappears
sidenote
monuments
of
art
the
stimulants
of
æsthetic
reproduction
are
called
or
this
combination
of
words
constitutes
a
verbal
paradox
for
the
beautiful
is
not
a
physical
fact
it
does
not
belong
to
things
but
to
the
activity
of
man
to
spiritual
energy
but
it
is
now
clear
through
what
transferences
and
associations
physical
things
and
facts
which
are
simply
aids
to
the
reproduction
of
the
beautiful
are
finally
called
elliptically
beautiful
things
and
physical
beauty
and
now
that
we
have
explained
this
elliptical
usage
we
shall
ourselves
employ
it
without
hesitation
sidenote
and
form
another
the
intervention
of
physical
beauty
serves
to
explain
another
meaning
of
the
words
and
as
used
by
æstheticians
some
call
content
the
internal
fact
or
expression
for
us
on
the
other
hand
form
and
form
the
marble
the
colours
the
rhythm
the
sounds
for
us
the
antithesis
of
form
thus
looking
upon
the
physical
fact
as
the
form
which
may
or
may
not
be
joined
to
the
content
it
also
serves
to
explain
another
aspect
of
what
is
called
æsthetic
ugliness
somebody
who
has
nothing
definite
to
express
may
try
to
conceal
his
internal
emptiness
in
a
flood
of
words
in
sounding
verse
in
deafening
polyphony
in
painting
that
dazzles
the
eye
or
by
heaping
together
great
architectural
masses
which
arrest
and
astonish
us
without
conveying
anything
whatever
ugliness
then
is
the
capricious
the
charlatanesque
and
in
reality
if
practical
caprice
did
not
intervene
in
the
theoretic
function
there
might
be
absence
of
beauty
but
never
the
real
presence
of
something
deserving
the
adjective
ugly
sidenote
and
artificial
physical
beauty
is
usually
divided
into
and
beauty
thus
we
reach
one
of
the
facts
which
have
given
the
greatest
trouble
to
thinkers
these
words
often
designate
facts
of
merely
practical
pleasure
any
one
who
calls
a
landscape
beautiful
where
the
eye
rests
upon
verdure
where
the
body
moves
briskly
and
the
warm
sun
envelops
and
caresses
the
limbs
does
not
speak
of
anything
æsthetic
but
it
is
nevertheless
indubitable
that
on
other
occasions
the
adjective
beautiful
applied
to
objects
and
scenes
existing
in
nature
has
a
completely
æsthetic
signification
it
has
been
observed
that
in
order
to
enjoy
natural
objects
æsthetically
we
must
abstract
from
their
external
and
historical
reality
and
separate
their
simple
semblance
or
appearance
from
existence
that
if
we
contemplate
a
landscape
with
our
head
between
our
legs
so
as
to
cancel
our
wonted
relations
with
it
the
landscape
appears
to
us
to
be
an
ideal
spectacle
that
nature
is
beautiful
only
for
him
who
contemplates
her
the
eye
of
the
that
zoologists
and
botanists
do
not
recognize
animals
and
flowers
that
natural
beauty
is
and
examples
of
discovery
are
the
points
of
view
pointed
out
by
men
of
taste
and
imagination
to
which
more
or
less
æsthetic
travellers
and
excursionists
afterwards
have
recourse
in
pilgrimage
whence
a
kind
of
collective
that
without
the
of
the
imagination
no
part
of
nature
is
beautiful
and
that
with
such
aid
the
same
natural
object
or
fact
is
according
to
the
disposition
of
the
soul
now
expressive
now
insignificant
now
expressive
of
one
definite
thing
now
of
another
sad
or
glad
sublime
or
ridiculous
sweet
or
laughable
finally
that
a
which
an
artist
would
not
some
extent
correct
does
not
all
these
observations
are
just
and
fully
confirm
the
fact
that
natural
beauty
is
simply
a
to
æsthetic
reproduction
which
presupposes
previous
production
without
the
previous
æsthetic
intuitions
of
the
imagination
nature
can
not
awaken
any
at
all
as
regards
natural
beauty
man
is
like
the
mythical
narcissus
at
the
fountain
leopardi
said
that
natural
beauty
is
rare
scattered
and
fugitive
it
is
imperfect
equivocal
variable
each
refers
the
natural
fact
to
the
expression
in
his
mind
one
artist
is
thrown
into
transports
by
a
smiling
landscape
another
by
a
another
by
the
pretty
face
of
a
young
girl
another
by
the
squalid
countenance
of
an
old
rascal
perhaps
the
first
will
say
that
the
and
the
ugly
face
of
the
old
rascal
are
the
second
that
the
smiling
landscape
and
the
face
of
the
young
girl
are
they
may
dispute
for
ever
but
they
will
never
agree
save
when
they
are
supplied
with
a
sufficient
dose
of
æsthetic
knowledge
to
enable
them
to
recognize
that
both
are
right
beauty
created
by
man
supplies
an
aid
that
is
far
more
ductile
and
efficacious
sidenote
in
addition
to
these
two
classes
æstheticians
also
sometimes
talk
in
their
treatises
of
a
beauty
a
mixture
of
what
precisely
of
natural
and
artificial
whoever
fixes
and
externalizes
operates
with
natural
data
which
he
does
not
create
but
combines
and
transforms
in
this
sense
every
artificial
product
is
a
mixture
of
nature
and
artifice
and
there
would
be
no
occasion
to
speak
of
a
mixed
beauty
as
of
a
special
category
but
it
sometimes
happens
that
combinations
already
given
in
nature
can
be
used
a
great
deal
more
than
in
others
as
for
instance
when
we
design
a
beautiful
garden
and
include
in
our
design
groups
of
trees
or
ponds
already
in
place
on
other
occasions
externalization
is
limited
by
the
impossibility
of
producing
certain
effects
artificially
thus
we
can
mix
colouring
matters
but
we
can
not
create
a
powerful
voice
or
a
face
and
figure
appropriate
to
this
or
that
character
in
a
play
we
must
therefore
seek
them
among
already
existing
things
and
make
use
of
them
when
found
when
therefore
we
employ
a
great
number
of
combinations
already
existing
in
nature
such
as
we
should
not
be
able
to
produce
artificially
if
they
did
not
exist
the
resulting
fact
is
called
beauty
sidenote
we
must
distinguish
from
artificial
beauty
those
instruments
of
reproduction
called
such
as
alphabets
musical
notes
hieroglyphics
and
all
pseudolanguages
from
the
language
of
flowers
and
flags
to
the
language
of
patches
so
much
in
vogue
in
the
society
of
the
eighteenth
century
writings
are
not
physical
facts
which
arouse
directly
impressions
answering
to
æsthetic
expressions
they
are
simple
of
what
must
be
done
in
order
to
produce
such
physical
facts
a
series
of
graphic
signs
serves
to
remind
us
of
the
movements
which
we
must
execute
with
our
vocal
apparatus
in
order
to
emit
certain
definite
sounds
if
through
practice
we
become
able
to
hear
the
words
without
opening
our
mouths
and
what
is
much
more
difficult
to
hear
the
sounds
by
running
the
eye
along
the
stave
all
this
does
not
alter
in
any
way
the
nature
of
the
writings
which
are
altogether
different
from
direct
physical
beauty
no
one
calls
the
book
which
contains
the
comedy
or
the
score
which
contains
giovanni
beautiful
in
the
same
sense
in
which
the
block
of
marble
which
contains
michæl
angelo
or
the
piece
of
coloured
wood
which
contains
the
is
metaphorically
called
beautiful
both
serve
the
reproduction
of
the
beautiful
but
the
former
by
a
far
longer
and
more
indirect
route
than
the
latter
sidenote
and
another
division
of
the
beautiful
still
found
in
treatises
is
that
into
and
not
by
beauties
have
been
understood
those
objects
which
have
to
serve
a
double
purpose
and
æsthetic
stimulants
of
intuitions
and
since
it
seems
that
the
first
purpose
sets
limits
and
barriers
in
the
way
of
the
second
the
resulting
beautiful
object
has
been
considered
as
beauty
architectural
works
are
especially
cited
and
just
for
this
reason
architecture
has
often
been
excluded
from
the
number
of
what
are
called
the
fine
arts
a
temple
must
above
all
things
be
for
the
use
of
a
cult
a
house
must
contain
all
the
rooms
needed
for
the
convenience
of
life
and
they
must
be
arranged
with
a
view
to
this
convenience
a
fortress
must
be
a
construction
capable
of
resisting
the
attacks
of
given
armies
and
the
blows
of
given
instruments
of
war
it
is
therefore
concluded
that
the
architect
field
is
restricted
he
may
to
some
extent
the
temple
the
house
the
fortress
but
he
is
bound
by
the
of
those
edifices
and
he
can
only
manifest
that
part
of
his
vision
of
beauty
which
does
not
impair
their
but
fundamental
objects
other
examples
are
taken
from
what
is
called
art
applied
to
industry
plates
glasses
knives
guns
and
combs
can
be
made
beautiful
but
it
is
held
that
their
beauty
must
not
be
pushed
so
far
as
to
prevent
our
eating
from
the
plate
drinking
from
the
glass
cutting
with
the
knife
firing
off
the
gun
or
combing
one
hair
with
the
comb
the
same
is
said
of
the
art
of
typography
a
book
should
be
beautiful
but
not
to
the
extent
of
being
difficult
or
impossible
to
read
sidenote
of
in
respect
of
all
this
we
must
observe
in
the
first
place
that
the
extrinsic
purpose
is
not
necessarily
precisely
because
it
is
such
a
limit
or
impediment
to
the
other
purpose
of
being
a
stimulus
to
æsthetic
reproduction
it
is
therefore
quite
false
to
maintain
that
architecture
for
example
is
by
its
nature
imperfect
and
not
free
since
it
must
also
obey
other
practical
purposes
in
fact
the
mere
presence
of
fine
works
of
architecture
is
enough
to
dispel
any
such
illusion
in
the
second
place
not
only
are
the
two
purposes
not
necessarily
contradictory
but
we
must
add
that
the
artist
always
has
the
means
of
preventing
this
contradiction
from
arising
how
by
simply
making
the
of
the
object
which
serves
a
practical
end
enter
as
material
into
his
æsthetic
intuition
and
externalization
he
will
not
need
to
add
anything
to
the
object
in
order
to
make
it
the
instrument
of
æsthetic
intuitions
it
will
be
so
if
perfectly
adapted
to
its
practical
purpose
rustic
dwellings
and
palaces
churches
and
barracks
swords
and
ploughs
are
beautiful
not
in
so
far
as
they
are
embellished
and
adorned
but
in
so
far
as
they
express
their
end
a
garment
is
only
beautiful
because
it
is
exactly
suitable
to
a
given
person
in
given
conditions
the
sword
bound
to
the
side
of
the
warrior
rinaldo
by
the
amorous
armida
was
not
beautiful
so
adorned
that
it
may
seem
a
useless
ornament
not
the
free
instrument
of
war
or
it
was
beautiful
if
you
will
but
to
the
eyes
and
imagination
of
the
sorceress
who
liked
to
see
her
lover
equipped
in
that
effeminate
way
the
æsthetic
activity
can
always
agree
with
the
practical
because
expression
is
truth
it
can
not
however
be
denied
that
æsthetic
contemplation
sometimes
hinders
practical
usage
for
instance
it
is
a
quite
common
experience
to
find
certain
new
objects
seem
so
well
adapted
to
their
purpose
and
therefore
so
beautiful
that
people
occasionally
feel
scruples
in
maltreating
them
by
passing
from
their
contemplation
to
their
use
it
was
for
this
reason
that
king
frederick
william
of
prussia
showed
such
repugnance
to
sending
his
magnificent
grenadiers
so
well
adapted
to
war
into
the
mud
and
fire
of
battle
while
his
less
æsthetic
son
frederick
the
great
obtained
from
them
excellent
service
sidenote
of
it
might
be
objected
to
the
explanation
of
the
physically
beautiful
as
a
simple
aid
to
the
reproduction
of
the
internally
beautiful
or
expressions
that
the
artist
creates
his
expressions
by
painting
or
by
sculpturing
by
writing
or
by
composing
and
that
therefore
the
physically
beautiful
instead
of
following
sometimes
precedes
the
æsthetically
beautiful
this
would
be
a
somewhat
superficial
mode
of
understanding
the
procedure
of
the
artist
who
never
in
reality
makes
a
stroke
with
his
brush
without
having
previously
seen
it
with
his
imagination
and
if
he
has
not
yet
seen
it
he
will
make
the
stroke
not
in
order
to
externalize
his
expression
which
does
not
yet
exist
but
as
a
kind
of
experiment
and
in
order
to
have
a
point
of
departure
for
further
meditation
and
internal
concentration
the
physical
point
of
departure
is
not
the
physically
beautiful
instrument
of
reproduction
but
a
means
that
may
be
called
like
retiring
into
solitude
or
the
many
other
expedients
frequently
very
strange
adopted
by
artists
and
scientists
who
vary
in
these
according
to
their
various
idiosyncrasies
the
old
æsthetician
baumgarten
advised
poets
seeking
inspiration
to
ride
on
horseback
to
drink
wine
in
moderation
and
provided
they
were
chaste
to
look
at
beautiful
women
xiv
errors
arising
from
the
confusion
between
physics
and
æsthetic
we
must
mention
a
series
of
fallacious
scientific
doctrines
which
have
arisen
from
the
failure
to
understand
the
purely
external
relation
between
the
æsthetic
fact
or
artistic
vision
and
the
physical
fact
or
instrument
which
aids
in
its
reproduction
together
with
brief
criticisms
of
them
deduced
from
what
has
already
been
said
sidenote
of
æsthetic
that
form
of
associationism
which
identifies
the
æsthetic
fact
with
the
of
two
images
finds
support
in
such
lack
of
apprehension
by
what
path
has
it
been
possible
to
arrive
at
such
an
error
so
repugnant
to
our
æsthetic
consciousness
which
is
a
consciousness
of
perfect
unity
never
of
duality
precisely
because
the
physical
and
æsthetic
facts
have
been
considered
separately
as
two
distinct
images
which
enter
the
spirit
the
one
drawn
in
by
the
other
first
one
and
then
the
other
a
picture
has
been
divided
into
the
image
of
the
and
the
image
of
the
of
the
picture
a
poem
into
the
image
of
the
and
the
image
of
the
of
the
words
but
this
dualism
of
images
is
the
physical
fact
does
not
enter
the
spirit
as
an
image
but
causes
the
reproduction
of
the
image
the
only
image
which
is
the
æsthetic
fact
in
so
far
as
it
blindly
stimulates
the
psychic
organism
and
produces
the
impression
which
answers
to
the
æsthetic
expression
already
produced
the
efforts
of
the
associationists
the
usurpers
of
in
the
field
of
æsthetic
to
emerge
from
the
difficulty
and
to
reaffirm
in
some
way
the
unity
which
has
been
destroyed
by
their
principle
of
association
are
highly
instructive
some
maintain
that
the
image
recalled
is
unconscious
others
leaving
unconsciousness
alone
hold
that
on
the
contrary
it
is
vague
vaporous
confused
thus
reducing
the
of
the
æsthetic
fact
to
the
of
bad
memory
but
the
dilemma
is
inexorable
either
keep
association
and
give
up
unity
or
keep
unity
and
give
up
association
no
third
way
out
of
the
difficulty
exists
sidenote
of
æsthetic
from
the
failure
to
analyse
natural
beauty
thoroughly
and
to
recognize
that
it
is
simply
an
incident
of
æsthetic
reproduction
and
from
having
looked
upon
it
on
the
contrary
as
given
in
nature
is
derived
all
that
portion
of
treatises
upon
æsthetic
entitled
of
or
sometimes
even
subdivided
save
the
mark
into
æsthetic
mineralogy
botany
and
zoology
we
do
not
wish
to
deny
that
such
treatises
contain
many
just
observations
and
are
sometimes
themselves
works
of
art
in
so
far
as
they
represent
beautifully
the
imaginings
and
fancies
or
impressions
of
their
authors
but
we
must
affirm
it
to
be
scientifically
false
to
ask
oneself
if
the
dog
be
beautiful
and
the
ornithorhynchus
ugly
the
lily
beautiful
and
the
artichoke
ugly
indeed
the
error
is
here
double
on
the
one
hand
æsthetic
physics
falls
back
into
the
equivocation
of
the
theory
of
artistic
and
literary
kinds
of
attempting
to
attach
æsthetic
determinations
to
the
abstractions
of
our
intellect
on
the
other
it
fails
to
recognize
as
we
said
the
true
formation
of
natural
beauty
a
formation
which
excludes
even
the
possibility
of
the
question
as
to
whether
some
given
individual
animal
flower
or
man
be
beautiful
or
ugly
what
is
not
produced
by
the
æsthetic
spirit
or
can
not
be
referred
to
it
is
neither
beautiful
nor
ugly
the
æsthetic
process
arises
from
the
ideal
connexions
in
which
natural
objects
are
placed
sidenote
of
the
theory
of
the
beauty
of
the
human
the
double
error
can
be
exemplified
by
the
question
as
to
the
of
the
human
body
upon
which
whole
volumes
have
been
written
here
we
must
before
everything
turn
those
who
discuss
this
subject
from
the
abstract
toward
the
concrete
by
asking
what
do
you
mean
by
the
human
body
that
of
the
male
the
female
or
the
hermaphrodite
let
us
assume
that
they
reply
by
dividing
the
inquiry
into
two
distinct
inquiries
as
to
male
and
female
beauty
there
really
are
writers
who
seriously
discuss
whether
man
or
woman
is
the
more
beautiful
and
let
us
continue
masculine
or
feminine
beauty
but
of
what
race
of
men
the
white
the
yellow
or
the
black
or
any
others
that
may
exist
according
to
the
division
you
prefer
let
us
assume
that
they
limit
themselves
to
the
white
race
and
drive
home
the
argument
to
what
of
the
white
race
and
when
we
have
restricted
them
gradually
to
one
corner
of
the
white
world
going
let
us
say
from
the
italian
to
the
tuscan
the
siennese
the
porta
camollia
quarter
we
will
proceed
very
good
but
at
what
age
of
the
human
body
and
in
what
condition
and
stage
that
of
the
newborn
babe
of
the
child
of
the
boy
of
the
adolescent
of
the
man
of
middle
age
and
so
on
and
of
him
who
is
at
rest
or
of
him
who
is
at
work
or
of
him
who
is
occupied
like
paul
potter
bull
or
the
ganymede
of
rembrandt
having
thus
arrived
by
successive
reductions
at
the
individual
determinatum
or
rather
at
this
man
here
pointed
out
with
the
finger
it
will
be
easy
to
expose
the
other
error
by
recalling
what
we
have
said
about
the
natural
fact
which
is
now
beautiful
now
ugly
according
to
the
point
of
view
and
to
what
is
passing
in
the
soul
of
the
artist
if
even
the
gulf
of
naples
have
its
detractors
and
if
there
be
artists
who
declare
it
inexpressive
preferring
the
gloomy
firs
the
clouds
and
perpetual
north
winds
of
northern
seas
is
it
really
possible
that
such
relativity
does
not
exist
for
the
human
body
source
of
the
most
varied
suggestions
sidenote
of
the
beauty
of
geometrical
the
question
of
the
of
geometrical
is
connected
with
æsthetic
physics
but
if
by
geometrical
figures
be
understood
the
concepts
of
geometry
the
concepts
of
the
triangle
the
square
the
cone
these
are
neither
beautiful
nor
ugly
just
because
they
are
concepts
if
on
the
other
hand
by
such
figures
be
understood
bodies
which
possess
definite
geometrical
forms
they
will
be
beautiful
or
ugly
like
every
natural
fact
according
to
the
ideal
connexions
in
which
they
are
placed
some
hold
that
those
geometrical
figures
are
beautiful
which
point
upwards
since
they
give
the
suggestion
of
firmness
and
of
power
we
do
not
deny
that
this
may
be
so
but
it
must
not
be
denied
on
the
other
hand
that
those
also
may
possess
beauty
which
give
the
impression
of
instability
and
weakness
where
they
represent
just
the
insecure
and
the
feeble
and
that
in
these
last
cases
the
firmness
of
the
straight
fine
and
the
lightness
of
the
cone
or
of
the
equilateral
triangle
would
seem
to
be
on
the
contrary
elements
of
ugliness
certainly
such
questions
as
to
the
beauty
of
nature
and
the
beauty
of
geometry
like
others
analogous
as
to
the
historically
beautiful
and
human
beauty
seem
less
absurd
in
the
æsthetic
of
the
sympathetic
which
really
means
by
the
words
æsthetic
beauty
the
representation
of
the
pleasing
but
the
claim
to
determine
scientifically
what
are
sympathetic
contents
and
what
are
irremediably
antipathetic
is
none
the
less
erroneous
even
in
the
sphere
of
that
doctrine
and
after
laying
down
those
premises
one
can
only
answer
such
questions
by
repeating
with
an
infinitely
long
postscript
the
of
the
first
ode
of
the
first
book
of
horace
and
the
of
leopardi
letter
to
carlo
pepoli
to
each
man
his
beautiful
sympathetic
as
to
each
man
his
fair
one
philography
is
not
science
sidenote
of
another
aspect
of
the
imitation
of
the
artist
sometimes
has
naturally
existing
facts
before
him
in
producing
the
artificial
instrument
or
physically
beautiful
these
are
called
his
bodies
stuffs
flowers
and
so
on
let
us
run
over
the
sketches
studies
and
notes
of
artists
leonardo
noted
down
in
his
when
he
was
working
on
the
last
supper
giovannina
weird
face
is
at
catherine
at
the
hospital
cristofano
di
castiglione
is
at
the
pietà
he
has
a
fine
head
christ
giovan
conte
of
cardinal
mortaro
suite
and
so
on
from
this
comes
the
illusion
that
the
artist
nature
when
it
would
perhaps
be
more
exact
to
say
that
nature
imitates
the
artist
and
obeys
him
the
illusion
that
imitates
has
sometimes
found
ground
and
support
in
this
illusion
as
also
in
its
variant
more
easily
maintained
which
makes
of
art
the
of
this
last
theory
presents
the
process
out
of
its
true
order
which
indeed
is
not
merely
upset
but
actually
inverted
for
the
artist
does
not
proceed
from
external
reality
in
order
to
modify
it
by
approximating
it
to
the
ideal
he
goes
from
the
impression
of
external
nature
to
expression
that
is
to
say
his
ideal
and
from
this
passes
to
the
natural
fact
which
he
employs
as
instrument
of
reproduction
of
the
ideal
fact
sidenote
of
the
theory
of
the
elementary
forms
of
the
another
consequence
of
the
confusion
between
the
æsthetic
fact
and
the
physical
fact
is
the
theory
of
the
forms
of
the
if
expression
if
the
beautiful
be
indivisible
the
physical
fact
on
the
contrary
in
which
it
externalizes
itself
can
easily
be
divided
and
subdivided
for
example
a
painted
surface
into
lines
and
colours
groups
and
curves
of
lines
kinds
of
colours
and
so
on
a
poem
into
strophes
verses
feet
syllables
a
piece
of
prose
into
chapters
paragraphs
headings
periods
phrases
words
and
so
on
the
parts
thus
obtained
are
not
æsthetic
facts
but
smaller
physical
facts
arbitrarily
divided
if
this
path
were
followed
and
the
confusion
persisted
in
we
should
end
by
concluding
that
the
true
elementary
forms
of
the
beautiful
are
the
æsthetic
law
several
times
promulgated
that
beauty
must
have
could
be
invoked
against
the
atoms
it
can
not
be
the
imperceptibility
of
the
too
small
or
the
inapprehensibility
of
the
too
large
but
a
greatness

implies
a
concept
widely
different
from
the
mathematical
indeed
what
is
called
imperceptible
and
inapprehensible
does
not
produce
an
impression
because
it
is
not
a
real
fact
but
a
concept
the
demand
for
bulk
in
the
beautiful
is
thus
reduced
to
the
actual

of
the
physical

which
serves

correspond
to

such
inquiries
are
as
if
in
political

one
were
to
seek
for
the
laws
of

in
the
physical
nature
of

the
persistent
fruitlessness
of
the
attempt

have
given
rise
before

to
some
suspicion
of
its
vanity
in
our
times
especially
necessity
for
an
æsthetic
has
been
often
proclaimed
of
an
æsthetic
starting
below
proceeding
like
natural
science
and
not
jumping
to
its
conclusions
inductive
but
æsthetic
has
always
been
both
inductive
and
deductive
like
every
philosophical
science
induction
and
deduction
can
not
be
separated
nor
can
they
separately
avail
to
characterize
a
true
science
but
the
word
induction
was
not
pronounced
here
by
chance
the
intention
was
to
imply
that
the
æsthetic
fact
is
really
nothing
but
a
physical
fact
to
be
studied
by
the
methods
proper
to
the
physical
and
natural
sciences
with
such
a
presupposition
and
in
such
a
faith
did
inductive
æsthetic
or
æsthetic
what
pride
in
this
modesty
begin
its
labours
it
conscientiously
began
by
making
a
collection
of
things
for
example
a
great
number
of
envelopes
of
various
shapes
and
sizes
and
asked
which
of
these
give
the
impression
of
beauty
and
which
of
ugliness
as
was
to
be
expected
the
inductive
æstheticians
speedily
found
themselves
in
a
difficulty
for
the
same
objects
that
appeared
ugly
in
one
aspect
appeared
beautiful
in
another
a
coarse
yellow
envelope
which
would
be
extremely
ugly
for
the
purpose
of
enclosing
a

just
what
is
wanted
for
a
writ

by

on
stamped

in
its
turn
would
look
very
bad
or
seem
at
any
rate
an
irony
enclosed
in
a
square
envelope
of
english
paper
such
considerations
of
simple
common
sense
should
have
sufficed
to
convince
inductive
æstheticians
that
the
beautiful
has
no
physical
existence
and
cause
them
to
desist
from
their
vain
and
ridiculous
quest
but
no
they
had
recourse
to
an
expedient
as
to
which
we
should
hardly
like
to
say
how
far
it
belongs
to
the
strict
method
of
natural
science
they
sent
their
envelopes
round
and
opened
a
trying
to
settle
in
what
beauty
or
ugliness
consists
by
the
votes
of
the
majority
sidenote
astrology
of
we
will
not
waste
time
over
this
subject
lest
we
should
seem
to
be
turning
ourselves
into
tellers
of
comic
tales
rather
than
expositors
of
æsthetic
science
and
of
its
problems
it
is
a
matter
of
fact
that
the
inductive
æstheticians
have
not
yet
discovered
single
he
who
despairs
of
doctors
is
apt
to
abandon
himself
to
charlatans
this
has
befallen
those
who
have
believed
in
the
naturalistic
laws
of
the
beautiful
artists
sometimes
adopt
empirical
canons
such
as
that
of
the
proportions
of
the
human
body
or
of
the
golden
section
that
is
to
say
of
a
line
divided
into
two
parts
in
such
a
manner
that
the
less
is
to
the
greater
as
is
the
greater
to
the
whole
line
ac
ac
such
canons
easily
become
their
superstitions
and
they
attribute
to
them
the
success
of
their
works
thus
michæl
angelo
left
as
a
precept
to
his
disciple
marco
del
pino
da
siena
that
he
should
always
make
a
pyramidal
serpentine
figure
multiplied
by
one
two
and
three
a
precept
which
did
not
enable
marco
da
siena
to
emerge
from
that
mediocrity
which
we
can
yet
observe
in
many
of
his
paintings
that
exist
here
in
naples
others
took
michæl
angelo
words
as
authority
for
the
precept
that
serpentine
undulating
lines
were
the
true
of
whole
volumes
have
been
composed
on
these
laws
of
beauty
on
the
golden
section
and
on
the
undulating
and
serpentine
lines
these
should
in
our
opinion
be
looked
upon
as
the
of
xv
the
activity
of
externalization
technique
and
the
theory
of
the
arts
sidenote
practical
activity
of
the
fact
of
the
production
of
physical
beauty
implies
as
has
already
been
remarked
a
vigilant
will
which
persists
in
not
allowing
certain
visions
intuitions
or
representations
to
be
lost
such
a
will
must
be
able
to
act
with
the
utmost
rapidity
and
as
it
were
instinctively
and
may
also
need
long
and
laborious
deliberations
in
any
case
thus
and
thus
only
does
the
practical
activity
enter
into
relations
with
the
æsthetic
that
is
to
say
no
longer
as
its
simple
accompaniment
but
as
a
really
distinct
moment
of
it
we
can
not
will
or
not
will
our
æsthetic
vision
we
can
however
will
or
not
will
to
externalize
it
or
rather
to
preserve
and
communicate
to
others
or
not
the
externalization
produced
sidenote
technique
of
this
volitional
fact
of
externalization
is
preceded
by
a
complex
of
various
kinds
of
knowledge
these
are
known
as
like
all
knowledge
which
precedes
a
practical
activity
thus
we
talk
of
an
in
the
same
metaphorical
and
elliptic
manner
that
we
talk
of
the
physically
beautiful
that
is
to
say
in
more
precise
language
at
the
service
of
the
practical
activity
directed
to
producing
stimuli
to
æsthetic
in
place
of
employing
so
lengthy
a
phrase
we
shall
here
avail
ourselves
of
ordinary
terminology
whose
meaning
we
now
understand
the
possibility
of
this
technical
knowledge
at
the
service
of
artistic
reproduction
is
what
has
led
minds
astray
to
imagine
the
existence
of
an
æsthetic
technique
of
internal
expression
which
is
tantamount
to
saying
a
doctrine
of
the
of
internal
expression
a
thing
that
is
altogether
inconceivable
and
we
know
well
the
reason
of
its
inconceivability
expression
considered
in
itself
is
a
primary
theoretic
activity
and
as
such
precedes
practice
and
intellectual
knowledge
which
illumines
practice
and
is
independent
alike
of
both
it
aids
for
its
part
to
illumine
practice
but
is
not
illuminated
by
it
expression
does
not
possess
because
it
has
not
an
it
has
intuitions
of
things
but
it
does
not
will
and
is
therefore
unanalysable
into
the
abstract
components
of
volition
means
and
end
sometimes
a
certain
writer
is
said
to
have
invented
a
new
technique
of
fiction
or
of
drama
or
a
painter
is
said
to
have
discovered
a
new
technique
of
distributing
light
the
word
is
used
here
at
hazard
because
the
is
really
romance
itself
or
that
new
itself
and
nothing
else
the
distribution
of
light
belongs
to
the
vision
of
the
picture
itself
as
the
technique
of
a
dramatist
is
his
dramatic
conception
itself
on
other
occasions
the
word
technique
is
used
to
designate
certain
merits
or
defects
in
a
work
that
is
a
failure
and
it
is
euphemistically
said
that
the
conception
is
bad
but
the
technique
good
or
that
the
conception
is
good
but
the
technique
bad
on
the
other
hand
when
we
talk
of
the
different
ways
of
painting
in
oils
or
of
etching
or
of
sculpturing
in
alabaster
then
the
word
technique
is
in
its
place
but
in
such
a
case
the
adjective
artistic
is
used
metaphorically
and
if
a
dramatic
technique
in
the
æsthetic
sense
be
impossible
a
theatrical
technique
of
processes
of
externalization
of
certain
particular
æsthetic
works
is
not
impossible
when
for
instance
women
were
introduced
on
the
stage
in
italy
in
the
second
half
of
the
sixteenth
century
in
place
of
men
dressed
as
women
this
was
a
true
and
real
discovery
in
theatrical
technique
such
too
was
the
perfecting
in
the
following
century
of
machines
for
the
rapid
changing
of
scenery
by
the
impresarios
of
venice
the
collection
of
technical
knowledge
at
the
service
of
artists
desirous
of
externalizing
their
expressions
can
be
divided
into
groups
which
may
be
entitled
of
the
thus
arises
a
theory
of
architecture
comprising
mechanical
laws
information
relating
to
the
weight
or
resistance
of
the
materials
of
construction
or
of
fortification
manuals
relating
to
the
method
of
mixing
lime
or
stucco
a
theory
of
sculpture
containing
advice
as
to
the
instruments
to
be
used
for
sculpturing
the
various
sorts
of
stone
for
obtaining
a
successful
mixture
of
bronze
for
working
with
the
chisel
for
the
accurate
casting
of
the
clay
or
plaster
model
for
keeping
clay
damp
a
theory
of
painting
on
the
various
techniques
of
tempera
of
of
of
pastel
on
the
proportions
of
the
human
body
on
the
laws
of
perspective
a
theory
of
oratory
with
precepts
as
to
the
method
of
producing
of
exercising
and
of
strengthening
the
voice
of
attitude
in
impersonation
and
gesture
a
theory
of
music
on
the
combinations
and
fusions
of
tones
and
sounds
and
so
on
such
collections
of
precepts
abound
in
all
literatures
and
since
it
is
impossible
to
say
what
is
useful
and
what
useless
to
know
books
of
this
sort
become
very
often
a
sort
of
encyclopædias
or
of
vitruvius
in
his
treatise
on
architecture
claims
for
the
architect
a
knowledge
of
letters
of
drawing
of
geometry
of
arithmetic
of
optic
of
history
of
natural
and
moral
philosophy
of
jurisprudence
of
medicine
of

and
so
on
everything
is
worth
knowing
learn
the
art
and
have
done
with
it
sidenote
theories
of
the
different
it
should
be
evident
that
such
empirical
collections
are
not
reducible
to
science
they
are
composed
of
notions
taken
from
various
sciences
and
disciplines
and
their
philosophical
and
scientific
principles
are
to
be
found
in
the
latter
to
propose
to
construct
a
scientific
theory
of
the
different
arts
would
be
to
wish
to
reduce
to
the
single
and
homogeneous
what
is
by
nature
multiple
and
heterogeneous
to
wish
to
destroy
the
existence
as
a
collection
of
what
was
put
together
precisely
to
form
a
collection
were
we
to
try
to
give
scientific
form
to
the
manuals
of
the
architect
the
painter
or
the
musician
it
is
clear
that
nothing
would
remain
in
our
hands
but
the
general
principles
of
mechanics
optics
or
acoustics
and
if
we
were
to
extract
and
isolate
what
may
be
scattered
among
them
of
properly
artistic
observations
to
make
of
them
a
scientific
system
then
the
sphere
of
the
individual
art
would
be
abandoned
and
that
of
æsthetic
entered
for
æsthetic
is
always
general
æsthetic
or
rather
it
can
not
be
divided
into
general
and
special
this
last
case
that
is
the
attempt
to
furnish
a
technique
which
ends
in
composing
an
æsthetic
arises
when
men
possessing
strong
scientific
instincts
and
a
natural
tendency
to
philosophy
set
themselves
to
work
to
produce
such
theories
and
technical
manuals
sidenote
of
æsthetic
theories
of
particular
but
the
confusion
between
physics
and
æsthetic
has
attained
to
its
highest
degree
when
æsthetic
theories
of
particular
arts
are
imagined
to
answer
such
questions
as
what
are
the
of
each
art
what
can
be
represented
with
colours
and
what
with
sounds
what
with
simple
monochromatic
lines
and
what
with
touches
of
various
colours
what
with
tones
and
what
with
metres
and
rhythms
what
are
the
limits
between
the
figurative
and
the
auditive
arts
between
painting
and
sculpture
poetry
and
music
this
translated
into
scientific
language
is
tantamount
to
asking
what
is
the
connexion
between
acoustics
and
æsthetic
expression
what
between
the
latter
and
optics
and
the
like
now
if
is
no
from
the
physical
fact
to
the
æsthetic
how
could
there
be
from
the
æsthetic
to
particular
groups
of
physical
facts
such
as
the
phenomena
of
optics
or
of
acoustics
sidenote
of
the
classification
of
the
the
have
no
æsthetic
limits
because
in
order
to
have
them
they
would
need
to
have
also
æsthetic
existence
in
their
particularity
and
we
have
demonstrated
the
altogether
empirical
genesis
of
those
partitions
consequently
any
attempt
at
an
æsthetic
classification
of
the
arts
is
absurd
if
they
be
without
limits
they
are
not
exactly
determinable
and
consequently
can
not
be
philosophically
classified
all
the
books
dealing
with
classifications
and
systems
of
the
arts
could
be
burned
without
any
loss
whatever
we
say
this
with
the
utmost
respect
to
the
writers
who
have
expended
their
labours
upon
them
the
impossibility
of
such
systematizations
finds
something
like
a
proof
in
the
strange
attempts
made
to
carry
it
out
the
first
and
most
common
partition
is
that
into
arts
of
sight
and
as
if
eyes
ears
and
imagination
were
on
the
same
level
and
could
be
deduced
from
the
same
logical
variable
as
others
have
proposed
the
division
into
arts
of
and
arts
of
arts
of
and
as
if
the
concepts
of
space
time
rest
and
motion
could
determine
special
æsthetic
forms
and
possess
anything
in
common
with
art
as
such
finally
others
have
amused
themselves
by
dividing
them
into
and
or
into
classic
and
thereby
conferring
the
value
of
scientific
concepts
upon
simple
historical
denominations
or
falling
into
those
rhetorical
partitions
of
expressive
forms
already
criticized
above
or
into
arts
can
only
be
seen
from
one
side
like
painting
and
arts
can
be
seen
from
all
sides
like
sculpture
and
similar
extravagances
which
hold
good
neither
in
heaven
nor
on
earth
the
theory
of
the
limits
of
the
arts
was
perhaps
at
the
time
when
it
was
put
forward
a
beneficial
critical
reaction
against
those
who
believed
in
the
possibility
of
remodelling
one
expression
into
another
as
the
or
into
a
series
of
paintings
and
indeed
held
a
poem
to
be
of
greater
or
lesser
value
according
as
it
could
or
could
not
be
translated
into
pictures
by
a
painter
but
if
the
rebellion
were
reasonable
and
resulted
in
victory
this
does
not
mean
that
the
arguments
employed
and
the
systems
constructed
for
the
purpose
were
sound
sidenote
of
the
theory
of
the
union
of
the
another
theory
which
is
a
corollary
to
that
of
the
arts
and
their
limits
falls
with
them
that
of
the
of
the
given
particular
arts
distinct
and
limited
it
was
asked
which
is
the
most
do
we
not
obtain
effects
by
several
we
know
nothing
of
this
we
know
only
that
in
each
particular
case
certain
given
artistic
intuitions
have
need
of
definite
physical
means
for
their
reproduction
and
other
artistic
intuitions
of
other
means
we
can
obtain
the
effect
of
certain
plays
by
simply
reading
them
others
need
declamation
and
scenic
display
there
are
some
artistic
intuitions
which
need
for
their
full
externalization
words
song
musical
instruments
colours
statuary
architecture
actors
while
others
are
quite
complete
in
a
slight
outline
made
with
the
pen
or
a
few
strokes
of
the
pencil
but
it
is
false
to
suppose
that
declamation
and
scenic
effects
and
all
the
other
things
together
that
we
have
mentioned
are
than
a
simple
reading
or
a
simple
outline
of
pen
or
pencil
because
each
of
those
facts
or
groups
of
facts
has
so
to
say
a
different
purpose
and
the
power
of
the
means
can
not
be
compared
when
the
purposes
are
different
sidenote
of
the
activity
of
externalization
to
utility
and
finally
it
is
only
from
the
point
of
view
of
a
clear
and
rigorous
distinction
between
the
true
and
proper
æsthetic
activity
and
the
practical
activity
of
externalization
that
we
can
solve
the
complicated
and
confused
questions
as
to
the
relations
between
and
and
and
we
have
demonstrated
above
that
art
as
art
is
independent
both
of
utility
and
of
morality
as
also
of
all
practical
value
without
this
independence
it
would
not
be
possible
to
speak
of
an
intrinsic
value
of
art
nor
indeed
to
conceive
an
æsthetic
science
which
demands
the
autonomy
of
the
æsthetic
fact
as
its
necessary
condition
but
it
would
be
erroneous
to
maintain
that
this
independence
of
the
vision
or
intuition
or
of
the
artist
should
be
simply
extended
to
the
practical
activity
of
externalization
and
communication
which
may
or
may
not
follow
the
æsthetic
fact
if
by
art
be
understood
the
externalization
of
art
then
utility
and
morality
have
a
perfect
right
to
enter
into
it
that
is
to
say
the
right
to
be
master
in
one
own
house
indeed
we
do
not
externalize
and
fix
all
the
many
expressions
and
intuitions
which
we
form
in
our
spirit
we
do
not
declare
our
every
thought
in
a
loud
voice
or
write
it
down
or
print
or
draw
or
paint
or
expose
it
to
the
public
we
from
the
crowd
of
intuitions
which
are
formed
or
at
least
sketched
within
us
and
the
selection
is
ruled
by
the
criteria
of
the
economic
disposition
of
life
and
of
its
moral
direction
therefore
when
we
have
fixed
an
intuition
we
have
still
to
decide
whether
or
no
we
should
communicate
it
to
others
and
to
whom
and
when
and
how
all
which
deliberations
come
equally
under
the
utilitarian
and
ethical
criterion
thus
we
find
the
concepts
of
of
the
of
of
an
end
of
to
some
extent
justified
although
these
can
in
no
way
be
justified
when
imposed
upon
art
as
art
and
we
have
ourselves
rejected
them
in
pure
æsthetic
error
always
contains
an
element
of
truth
he
who
formulated
those
erroneous
æsthetic
propositions
in
reality
had
his
eye
on
practical
facts
which
attach
themselves
externally
to
the
æsthetic
fact
and
belong
to
economic
and
moral
fife
it
is
well
to
advocate
yet
greater
freedom
in
making
known
the
means
of
æsthetic
reproduction
we
are
of
the
same
opinion
and
leave
projects
for
legislation
and
for
legal
action
against
immoral
art
to
hypocrites
to
the
ingenuous
and
to
wasters
of
time
but
the
proclamation
of
this
freedom
and
the
fixing
of
its
limits
how
wide
soever
they
be
is
always
the
task
of
morality
and
it
would
in
any
case
be
out
of
place
to
invoke
that
highest
principle
that
æsthetices
which
is
the
independence
of
art
to
deduce
from
it
the
guiltlessness
of
the
artist
who
calculates
like
an
immoral
speculator
upon
the
unhealthy
tastes
of
his
readers
in
the
externalization
of
his
imaginings
or
the
freedom
of
hawkers
to
sell
obscene
statuettes
in
the
public
squares
this
last
case
is
the
affair
of
the
police
as
the
first
must
be
brought
before
the
tribunal
of
the
moral
consciousness
the
æsthetic
judgement
on
the
work
of
art
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
morality
of
the
artist
as
a
practical
man
or
with
the
provisions
to
be
taken
that
the
things
of
art
may
not
be
diverted
to
evil
ends
alien
to
her
nature
which
is
pure
theoretic
contemplation
xvi
taste
and
the
reproduction
of
art
sidenote
judgement
its
identity
with
æsthetic
when
the
entire
æsthetic
and
externalizing
process
has
been
completed
when
a
beautiful
expression
has
been
produced
and
it
has
been
fixed
in
a
definite
physical
material
what
is
meant
by
ill
to
reproduce
it
in
oneself
answer
the
critics
of
art
almost
with
one
voice
very
good
let
us
try
thoroughly
to
understand
this
fact
and
with
that
object
in
view
let
us
represent
it
schematically
the
individual
a
is
seeking
the
expression
of
an
impression
which
he
feels
or
anticipates
but
has
not
yet
expressed
see
him
trying
various
words
and
phrases
which
may
give
the
expression
that
expression
which
must
exist
but
which
he
does
not
possess
he
tries
the
combination
but
rejects
it
as
unsuitable
inexpressive
incomplete
ugly
he
tries
the
combination
with
a
like
result
does
not
see
at
all
or
does
not
see
the
expression
still
eludes
him
after
other
vain
attempts
during
which
he
sometimes
approaches
sometimes
retreats
from
the
mark
at
which
he
aims
all
of
a
sudden
almost
as
though
formed
spontaneously
of
itself
he
forms
the
expression
and
facta
he
enjoys
for
an
instant
æsthetic
pleasure
or
the
pleasure
of
the
beautiful
the
ugly
with
its
correlative
displeasure
was
the
æsthetic
activity
which
had
not
succeeded
in
conquering
the
obstacle
the
beautiful
is
the
expressive
activity
which
now
displays
itself
triumphant
we
have
taken
this
example
from
the
domain
of
speech
as
being
nearer
and
more
accessible
and
because
we
all
talk
though
we
do
not
all
draw
or
paint
now
if
another
individual
whom
we
shall
call
b
is
to
judge
that
expression
and
decide
whether
it
be
beautiful
or
ugly
he
of
necessity
place
himself
at
a
point
of
view
and
go
through
the
whole
process
again
with
the
help
of
the
physical
sign
supplied
to
him
by
a
if
a
has
seen
clearly
then
b
who
has
placed
himself
at
a
point
of
view
will
also
see
clearly
and
will
see
this
expression
as
beautiful
if
a
has
not
seen
clearly
then
b
also
will
not
see
clearly
and
will
find
the
expression
more
or
less
ugly
as
a
sidenote
of
it
may
be
observed
that
we
have
not
taken
into
consideration
two
other
cases
that
of
a
having
a
clear
and
b
an
obscure
vision
and
that
of
a
having
an
obscure
and
b
a
clear
vision
strictly
speaking
these
two
cases
are
expressive
activity
just
because
it
is
activity
is
not
caprice
but
spiritual
necessity
it
can
not
solve
a
definite
æsthetic
problem
save
in
one
way
which
is
the
right
way
it
will
be
objected
to
this
plain
statement
that
works
which
seem
beautiful
to
the
artists
are
afterwards
found
to
be
ugly
by
the
critics
while
other
works
with
which
the
artists
were
discontented
and
held
to
be
imperfect
or
failures
are
on
the
contrary
held
to
be
beautiful
and
perfect
by
the
critics
but
in
this
case
one
of
the
two
is
wrong
either
the
critics
or
the
artists
sometimes
the
artists
at
other
times
the
critics
indeed
the
producer
of
an
expression
does
not
always
fully
realize
what
is
happening
in
his
soul
haste
vanity
want
of
reflexion
theoretic
prejudices
make
people
say
and
others
sometimes
almost
believe
that
works
of
ours
are
beautiful
which
if
we
really
looked
into
ourselves
we
should
see
to
be
ugly
as
they
are
in
reality
thus
poor
don
quixote
when
he
had
reattached
to
his
helmet
as
well
as
he
could
the
vizor
of
cardboard
the
vizor
that
had
showed
itself
to
possess
but
the
feeblest
force
of
resistance
at
the
first
encounter
took
good
care
not
to
test
it
again
with
a
but
simply
declared
and
maintained
it
to
be
says
the
author
celada
finisima
de
and
in
other
cases
the
same
reasons
or
opposite
but
analogous
ones
trouble
the
consciousness
of
the
artist
and
cause
him
to
value
badly
what
he
has
successfully
produced
or
to
strive
to
undo
and
do
again
for
the
worse
what
he
has
done
well
in
artistic
spontaneity
an
instance
of
this
is
tasso
and
his
passage
from
the
to
the
in
the
same
way
haste
laziness
want
of
reflexion
theoretic
prejudices
personal
sympathies
or
animosities
and
other
motives
of
a
similar
sort
sometimes
cause
the
critics
to
proclaim
ugly
what
is
beautiful
and
beautiful
what
is
ugly
were
they
to
eliminate
such
disturbing
elements
they
would
feel
the
work
of
art
as
it
really
is
and
would
not
leave
it
to
posterity
that
more
diligent
and
more
dispassionate
judge
to
award
the
palm
or
to
do
that
justice
which
they
have
refused
sidenote
of
taste
and
it
is
clear
from
the
preceding
theorem
that
the
activity
of
judgement
which
criticizes
and
recognizes
the
beautiful
is
identical
with
what
produces
it
the
only
difference
lies
in
the
diversity
of
circumstances
since
in
the
one
case
it
is
a
question
of
æsthetic
production
in
the
other
of
reproduction
the
activity
which
judges
is
called
the
productive
activity
is
called
genius
and
taste
are
therefore
substantially
the
common
remark
that
the
critic
should
possess
something
of
the
genius
of
the
artist
and
that
the
artist
should
possess
taste
gives
a
glimpse
of
this
identity
or
the
remark
that
there
exists
an
active
productive
and
a
passive
reproductive
taste
but
it
is
also
negated
in
other
equally
common
remarks
as
when
people
speak
of
taste
without
genius
or
of
genius
without
taste
these
last
observations
are
meaningless
unless
they
allude
to
quantitative
or
psychological
differences
those
being
called
geniuses
without
taste
who
produce
works
of
art
inspired
in
their
chief
parts
and
neglected
or
defective
in
their
secondary
parts
and
men
of
taste
without
genius
those
who
while
they
succeed
in
obtaining
certain
isolated
or
secondary
merits
do
not
possess
sufficient
power
for
a
great
artistic
synthesis
analogous
explanations
can
easily
be
given
of
other
similar
expressions
but
to
posit
a
substantial
difference
between
genius
and
taste
between
artistic
production
and
reproduction
would
render
both
communication
and
judgement
alike
inconceivable
how
could
we
judge
what
remained
external
to
us
how
could
that
which
is
produced
by
a
given
activity
be
judged
by
a
activity
the
critic
may
be
a
small
genius
the
artist
a
great
one
the
former
may
have
the
strength
of
ten
the
latter
of
a
hundred
the
former
in
order
to
reach
a
certain
height
will
have
need
of
the
assistance
of
the
other
but
the
nature
of
both
must
remain
the
same
to
judge
dante
we
must
raise
ourselves
to
his
level
let
it
be
well
understood
that
empirically
we
are
not
dante
nor
dante
we
but
in
that
moment
of
contemplation
and
judgement
our
spirit
is
one
with
that
of
the
poet
and
in
that
moment
we
and
he
are
one
thing
in
this
identity
alone
resides
the
possibility
that
our
little
souls
can
echo
great
souls
and
grow
great
with
them
in
the
universality
of
the
spirit
sidenote
with
other
let
us
remark
in
passing
that
what
has
been
said
of
the
æsthetic
judgement
holds
good
equally
for
every
other
activity
and
for
every
other
judgement
and
that
scientific
economic
and
ethical
criticism
is
effected
in
a
like
manner
to
limit
ourselves
to
this
last
only
if
we
place
ourselves
ideally
in
the
same
conditions
in
which
he
found
himself
who
took
a
given
resolution
can
we
form
a
judgement
as
to
whether
his
decision
were
moral
or
immoral
an
action
would
otherwise
remain
incomprehensible
and
therefore
impossible
to
judge
a
homicide
may
be
a
rascal
or
a
hero
if
this
be
within
limits
indifferent
as
regards
the
defence
of
society
which
condemns
both
to
the
same
punishment
it
is
not
indifferent
to
one
who
wishes
to
distinguish
and
judge
from
the
moral
point
of
view
and
we
therefore
can
not
dispense
with
reconstructing
the
individual
psychology
of
the
homicide
in
order
to
determine
the
true
nature
of
his
deed
not
merely
in
its
legal
but
also
in
its
moral
aspect
in
ethics
a
moral
taste
or
tact
is
sometimes
mentioned
answering
to
what
is
generally
called
the
moral
consciousness
that
is
to
say
to
the
activity
of
the
good
will
itself
sidenote
of
æsthetic
absolutism
intellectualism
and
the
explanation
above
given
of
æsthetic
judgement
or
reproduction
both
agrees
with
and
condemns
the
absolutists
and
relativists
those
who
affirm
and
those
who
deny
the
absoluteness
of
taste
in
affirming
that
the
beautiful
can
be
judged
the
absolutists
are
right
but
the
theory
on
which
they
found
their
affirmation
is
not
tenable
because
they
conceive
of
the
beautiful
that
is
æsthetic
value
as
something
placed
outside
the
æsthetic
activity
as
a
concept
or
a
model
which
an
artist
realizes
in
his
work
and
of
which
the
critic
avails
himself
afterwards
in
judging
the
work
itself
these
concepts
and
models
have
no
existence
in
art
for
when
proclaiming
that
every
art
can
be
judged
only
in
itself
and
that
it
has
its
model
in
itself
they
implicitly
denied
the
existence
of
objective
models
of
beauty
whether
these
are
intellectual
concepts
or
ideas
suspended
in
a
metaphysical
heaven
in
proclaiming
this
the
relativists
are
perfectly
right
and
effect
an
advance
upon
them
however
the
initial
rationality
of
their
thesis
in
its
turn
becomes
converted
into
a
false
theory
repeating
the
ancient
adage
that
there
is
no
accounting
for
tastes
they
believe
that
æsthetic
expression
is
of
the
same
nature
as
the
pleasant
and
the
unpleasant
which
every
one
feels
in
his
own
way
and
about
which
there
is
no
dispute
but
we
know
that
the
pleasant
and
the
unpleasant
are
utilitarian
practical
facts
thus
the
relativists
deny
the
specific
character
of
the
æsthetic
fact
and
again
confound
expression
with
impression
the
theoretic
with
the
practical
the
true
solution
lies
in
rejecting
alike
relativism
or
psychologism
and
false
absolutism
and
in
recognizing
that
the
criterion
of
taste
is
absolute
but
absolute
in
a
different
way
from
that
of
the
intellect
which
expresses
itself
in
ratiocination
the
criterion
of
taste
is
absolute
with
the
intuitive
absoluteness
of
the
imagination
thus
any
act
of
expressive
activity
which
is
so
really
is
to
be
recognized
as
beautiful
and
any
fact
as
ugly
in
which
expressive
activity
and
passivity
are
found
engaged
with
one
another
in
an
unfinished
struggle
sidenote
of
relative
between
absolutists
and
relativists
is
a
third
class
which
may
be
called
that
of
the
relative
relativists
these
affirm
the
existence
of
absolute
values
in
other
fields
such
as
logic
and
ethic
but
deny
it
in
the
field
of
æsthetic
to
dispute
about
science
or
morals
seems
to
them
to
be
rational
and
justifiable
because
science
depends
upon
the
universal
common
to
all
men
and
morality
upon
duty
which
is
also
a
law
of
human
nature
but
how
dispute
about
art
which
depends
upon
imagination
not
only
however
is
the
imaginative
activity
universal
and
no
less
inherent
in
human
nature
than
the
logical
concept
and
practical
duty
but
there
is
a
preliminary
objection
to
the
thesis
in
question
if
the
absoluteness
of
the
imagination
be
denied
we
must
also
deny
intellectual
or
conceptual
truth
and
implicitly
morality
does
not
morality
presuppose
logical
distinctions
how
could
these
be
known
otherwise
than
in
expressions
and
words
that
is
to
say
in
imaginative
form
if
the
absoluteness
of
the
imagination
were
removed
the
life
of
the
spirit
would
tremble
to
its
foundations
one
individual
would
no
longer
understand
another
nor
indeed
his
own
self
of
a
moment
before
which
is
already
another
individual
considered
a
moment
after
sidenote
founded
on
the
variation
of
the
stimulus
and
of
psychic
nevertheless
variety
of
judgements
is
an
indubitable
fact
men
disagree
as
to
logical
ethical
and
economical
valuations
and
they
disagree
equally
or
even
more
as
to
the
æsthetic
if
certain
reasons
recorded
by
us
above
such
as
haste
prejudices
passions
may
lessen
the
importance
of
this
disagreement
they
do
not
on
that
account
annul
it
when
speaking
of
the
stimuli
of
reproduction
we
have
added
a
caution
for
we
said
that
reproduction
takes
place
all
the
other
conditions
remain
do
they
remain
equal
does
the
hypothesis
correspond
to
reality
it
would
appear
not
in
order
to
reproduce
an
impression
several
times
by
means
of
a
suitable
physical
stimulus
it
is
necessary
that
this
stimulus
be
not
changed
and
that
the
organism
remain
in
the
same
psychical
conditions
as
those
in
which
was
experienced
the
impression
that
it
is
desired
to
reproduce
now
it
is
a
fact
that
the
physical
stimulus
is
continually
changing
and
in
like
manner
the
psychological
conditions
grow
dark
frescoes
fade
statues
lose
noses
hands
and
legs
architecture
becomes
totally
or
partially
a
ruin
the
tradition
of
the
execution
of
a
piece
of
music
is
lost
the
text
of
a
poem
is
corrupted
by
bad
copyists
or
bad
printing
these
are
obvious
instances
of
i
the
changes
which
daily
occur
in
objects
or
physical
stimuli
as
regards
psychological
conditions
we
will
not
dwell
upon
the
cases
of
deafness
or
blindness
that
is
to
say
upon
the
loss
of
entire
orders
of
psychical
impressions
these
cases
are
secondary
and
of
less
importance
compared
with
the
fundamental
daily
inevitable
and
perpetual
changes
of
the
society
around
us
and
of
the
internal
conditions
of
our
individual
life
the
phonetic
manifestations
or
words
and
verses
of
dante
must
produce
a
very
different
impression
on
an
italian
citizen
engaged
in
the
politics
of
the
third
rome
from
that
experienced
by
a
and
intimate
contemporary
of
the
poet
the
madonna
of
cimabue
is
still
in
the
church
of
santa
maria
novella
but
does
she
speak
to
the
visitor
of
as
to
the
florentines
of
the
thirteenth
century
even
though
she
were
not
also
darkened
by
time
must
we
not
suppose
that
the
impression
which
she
now
produces
is
altogether
different
from
that
of
former
times
and
even
in
the
case
of
the
same
individual
poet
will
a
poem
composed
by
him
in
youth
make
the
same
impression
upon
him
when
he
it
in
his
old
age
with
psychic
conditions
altogether
changed
sidenote
of
the
distinction
of
signs
into
natural
and
it
is
true
that
certain
æstheticians
have
attempted
a
distinction
between
stimuli
and
stimuli
between
and
signs
the
former
are
held
to
have
a
constant
effect
upon
all
the
latter
only
upon
a
limited
circle
in
their
belief
signs
employed
in
painting
are
natural
those
used
in
poetry
conventional
but
the
difference
between
them
is
at
the
most
only
one
of
degree
it
has
often
been
said
that
painting
is
a
language
understood
by
all
while
with
poetry
it
is
otherwise
here
for
example
leonardo
found
one
of
the
prerogatives
of
his
art
which
hath
not
need
of
interpreters
of
different
tongues
as
have
letters
and
it
pleases
man
and
beast
he
relates
the
anecdote
of
that
portrait
of
the
father
of
a
family
which
the
little
grandchildren
were
wont
to
caress
while
they
were
still
in
and
the
dogs
and
cats
of
the
house
in
like
manner
but
other
anecdotes
such
as
those
of
the
savages
who
took
the
portrait
of
a
soldier
for
a
boat
or
considered
the
portrait
of
a
man
on
horseback
to
be
furnished
with
only
one
leg
are
apt
to
shake
faith
in
the
understanding
of
painting
by
sucklings
dogs
and
cats
fortunately
no
arduous
researches
are
necessary
to
convince
oneself
that
pictures
poetry
and
all
works
of
art
only
produce
effects
upon
souls
prepared
to
receive
them
natural
signs
do
not
exist
because
all
are
equally
conventional
or
to
speak
with
greater
exactness
sidenote
surmounting
of
granting
this
how
are
we
to
succeed
in
causing
the
expression
to
be
reproduced
by
means
of
the
physical
object
how
obtain
the
same
effect
when
the
conditions
are
no
longer
the
same
would
it
not
rather
seem
necessary
to
conclude
that
expressions
can
not
be
reproduced
despite
the
physical
instruments
made
for
the
purpose
and
that
what
is
called
reproduction
consists
in
ever
new
expressions
such
would
indeed
be
the
conclusion
if
the
varieties
of
physical
and
psychical
conditions
were
intrinsically
insurmountable
but
since
the
insuperability
has
none
of
the
characteristics
of
necessity
we
must
on
the
contrary
conclude
that
reproduction
always
occurs
when
we
can
replace
ourselves
in
the
conditions
in
which
the
stimulus
physical
beauty
was
produced
not
only
can
we
replace
ourselves
in
these
conditions
as
an
abstract
possibility
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
we
do
so
continually
individual
life
which
is
communion
with
ourselves
with
our
past
and
social
life
which
is
communion
with
our
like
would
not
otherwise
be
possible
sidenote
and
historical
as
regards
the
physical
object
palæographers
and
philologists
who
to
texts
their
original
physiognomy
of
pictures
and
of
statues
and
other
industrious
toilers
strive
precisely
to
preserve
or
to
restore
to
the
physical
object
all
its
primitive
energy
these
efforts
are
certainly
not
always
successful
or
are
not
completely
successful
for
it
is
never
or
hardly
ever
possible
to
obtain
a
restoration
complete
in
its
smallest
details
but
the
insurmountable
is
here
only
present
accidentally
and
must
not
lead
us
to
overlook
the
successes
which
actually
are
achieved
labours
for
its
part
to
reintegrate
in
us
the
psychological
conditions
which
have
changed
in
the
course
of
history
it
revives
the
dead
completes
the
fragmentary
and
enables
us
to
see
a
work
of
art
a
physical
object
as
its
author
saw
it
in
the
moment
of
production
a
condition
of
this
historical
labour
is
tradition
with
the
help
of
which
it
is
possible
to
collect
the
scattered
rays
and
concentrate
them
in
one
focus
with
the
help
of
memory
we
surround
the
physical
stimulus
with
all
the
facts
among
which
it
arose
and
thus
we
enable
it
to
act
upon
us
as
it
acted
upon
him
who
produced
it
where
the
tradition
is
broken
interpretation
is
arrested
in
this
case
the
products
of
the
past
remain
silent
for
us
thus
the
expressions
contained
in
the
etruscan
or
mexican
inscriptions
are
unattainable
thus
we
still
hear
discussions
among
ethnographers
as
to
whether
certain
products
of
the
art
of
savages
are
pictures
or
writings
thus
archæologists
and
prehistorians
are
not
always
able
to
establish
with
certainty
whether
the
figures
found
on
the
pottery
of
a
certain
region
and
on
other
instruments
employed
are
of
a
religious
or
profane
nature
but
the
arrest
of
interpretation
as
that
of
restoration
is
never
a
definitely
insurmountable
barrier
and
the
daily
discoveries
of
new
historical
sources
and
of
new
methods
of
better
exploiting
the
old
which
we
may
hope
to
see
ever
improving
link
up
again
broken
traditions
we
do
not
wish
to
deny
that
erroneous
historical
interpretation
sometimes
produces
what
may
be
called
new
expressions
imposed
upon
the
ancient
artistic
fancies
instead
of
historical
reproductions
the
fascination
of
the
past
depends
in
part
upon
these
expressions
of
ours
which
we
weave
upon
the
historical
thus
has
been
discovered
in
greek
plastic
art
the
calm
and
serene
intuition
of
life
of
those
peoples
who
nevertheless
felt
the
universal
sorrow
so
poignantly
thus
the
terror
of
the
year
has
recently
been
discerned
on
the
faces
of
the
byzantine
saints
a
terror
which
is
a
misunderstanding
or
an
artificial
legend
invented
later
by
men
of
learning
but
tends
precisely
to
circumscribe
fancies
and
to
establish
exactly
the
point
of
view
from
which
we
must
look
by
means
of
the
above
process
we
live
in
communication
with
other
men
of
the
present
and
of
the
past
and
we
must
not
conclude
because
we
sometimes
and
indeed
often
meet
with
an
unknown
or
an
that
therefore
when
we
believe
we
are
engaged
in
a
dialogue
we
are
always
speaking
a
monologue
or
that
we
are
unable
even
to
repeat
the
monologue
which
we
formerly
held
with
ourselves

the

this
brief
exposition
of
the
method
by
which
is
obtained
the
reintegration
of
the
original
conditions
in
which
the
work
of
art
was
produced
and
consequently
reproduction
and
judgement
are
made
possible
shows
how
important
is
the
function
fulfilled
by
historical
research
in
relation
to
artistic
and
literary
works
which
is
what
is
usually
called
or
method
in
literature
and
art
sidenote
criticism
in
literature
and
art
its
without
tradition
and
historical
criticism
the
enjoyment
of
all
or
nearly
all
the
works
of
art
produced
by
humanity
would
be
irrevocably
lost
we
should
be
little
more
than
animals
immersed
in
the
present
alone
or
in
the
most
recent
past
it
is
fatuous
to
despise
and
laugh
at
one
who
reconstitutes
an
authentic
text
explains
the
sense
of
forgotten
words
and
customs
investigates
the
conditions
in
which
an
artist
lived
and
accomplishes
all
those
labours
which
revive
the
qualities
and
the
original
colouring
of
works
of
art
sometimes
a
depreciatory
or
negative
judgement
is
passed
upon
historical
research
because
of
the
presumed
or
proved
inability
of
such
researches
in
many
cases
to
give
us
a
true
understanding
of
works
of
art
but
it
must
be
observed
in
the
first
place
that
historical
research
does
not
only
fulfil
the
task
of
helping
to
reproduce
and
judge
artistic
works
the
biography
of
a
writer
or
of
an
artist
for
example
and
the
study
of
the
customs
of
a
period
have
an
interest
of
their
own
that
is
to
say
extraneous
to
the
history
of
art
but
not
to
other
forms
of
historiography
if
allusion
be
made
to
those
researches
which
do
not
appear
to
have
interest
of
any
kind
nor
to
fulfil
any
purpose
it
must
be
replied
that
the
historical
student
must
often
reconcile
himself
to
the
useful
but
inglorious
function
of
a
collector
of
facts
these
facts
remain
for
the
time
being
formless
incoherent
and
meaningless
but
they
are
preserves
or
mines
for
the
historian
of
the
future
and
for
whosoever
may
afterwards
want
them
for
any
purpose
in
the
same
way
in
a
library
books
which
nobody
asks
for
are
placed
on
the
shelves
and
catalogued
because
they
may
be
asked
for
at
some
time
or
other
certainly
just
as
an
intelligent
librarian
gives
the
preference
to
the
acquisition
and
cataloguing
of
those
books
which
he
foresees
may
be
of
more
or
better
service
so
intelligent
students
possess
an
instinct
as
to
what
is
or
may
more
probably
be
of
use
among
the
material
of
facts
which
they
are
examining
while
others
less
well
endowed
less
intelligent
or
more
hasty
in
producing
accumulate
useless
rubbish
refuse
and
sweepings
and
lose
themselves
in
details
and
petty
discussions
but
this
appertains
to
the
economy
of
research
and
does
not
concern
us
it
concerns
at
most
the
master
who
selects
the
subjects
the
publisher
who
pays
for
the
printing
and
the
critic
who
is
called
upon
to
praise
or
to
blame
the
research
workers
on
the
other
hand
it
is
clear
that
historical
research
directed
to
illuminate
a
work
of
art
does
not
alone
suffice
to
bring
it
to
birth
in
our
spirit
and
place
us
in
a
position
to
judge
it
but
presupposes
taste
that
is
to
say
an
alert
and
cultivated
imagination
the
greatest
historical
erudition
may
accompany
a
gross
or
otherwise
defective
taste
a
slow
imagination
or
as
they
say
a
cold
hard
heart
closed
to
art
which
is
the
lesser
evil
great
erudition
with
defective
taste
or
natural
taste
and
much
ignorance
the
question
has
often
been
asked
and
perhaps
it
will
be
best
to
deny
that
it
has
any
meaning
because
one
can
not
tell
which
of
two
evils
is
the
less
or
what
exactly
that
means
the
merely
learned
man
never
succeeds
in
entering
into
direct
communion
with
great
spirits
he
keeps
wandering
for
ever
about
the
outer
courts
the
staircases
and
antechambers
of
their
palaces
but
the
gifted
ignoramus
either
passes
by
masterpieces
to
him
inaccessible
or
instead
of
understanding
works
of
art
as
they
really
are
invents
others
with
his
fancy
now
the
labour
of
the
former
may
at
least
serve
to
enlighten
others
but
the
genius
of
the
latter
remains
altogether
sterile
in
relation
to
knowledge
how
then
can
we
in
a
certain
respect
fail
to
prefer
the
conscientious
learned
man
to
the
inconclusive
though
gifted
man
who
is
not
really
gifted
if
he
resign
himself
and
in
so
far
as
he
resigns
himself
to
his
inconclusiveness
sidenote
and
artistic
history
its
distinction
from
historical
criticism
and
from
the
æsthetic
we
must
accurately
distinguish
history
of
art
and
from
those
historical
labours
where
works
of
art
are
used
but
for
extraneous
purposes
such
as
biography
civil
religious
and
political
history
etc
and
also
from
historical
erudition
directed
to
the
preparation
of
the
æsthetic
synthesis
of
reproduction
the
difference
of
the
first
two
is
obvious
the
history
of
art
and
literature
has
the
works
of
art
themselves
as
its
principal
subject
those
other
labours
invoke
and
interrogate
works
of
art
but
only
as
witnesses
from
whom
to
discover
the
truth
of
facts
which
are
not
æsthetic
the
second
difference
to
which
we
have
referred
may
seem
less
profound
it
is
however
very
great
erudition
directed
to
illuminate
the
understanding
of
works
of
art
aims
simply
at
calling
into
existence
a
certain
internal
fact
an
æsthetic
reproduction
artistic
and
literary
history
on
the
other
hand
does
not
appear
until
after
such
reproduction
has
been
obtained
it
implies
therefore
a
further
stage
of
labour
like
all
other
history
its
object
is
to
record
precisely
such
facts
as
have
really
taken
place
in
this
case
artistic
and
literary
facts
a
man
who
after
having
acquired
the
requisite
historical
erudition
reproduces
in
himself
and
tastes
a
work
of
art
may
remain
simply
a
man
of
taste
or
at
the
most
express
his
own
feeling
with
an
exclamation
of
praise
or
condemnation
this
does
not
suffice
for
the
making
of
a
historian
of
literature
and
art
something
else
is
needed
namely
that
a
new
mental
operation
succeed
in
him
the
simple
reproduction
this
new
operation
is
in
its
turn
an
expression
the
expression
of
the
reproduction
the
historical
description
exposition
or
representation
there
is
this
difference
then
between
the
man
of
taste
and
the
historian
the
first
merely
reproduces
in
his
spirit
the
work
of
art
the
second
after
having
reproduced
it
represents
it
historically
or
applies
those
categories
by
which
as
we
know
history
is
differentiated
from
pure
art
artistic
and
literary
history
is
therefore
historical
work
of
art
founded
upon
one
or
more
works
of
the
name
artistic
or
literary
critic
is
used
in
various
senses
sometimes
it
is
applied
to
the
scholar
who
devotes
his
services
to
literature
sometimes
to
the
historian
who
reveals
the
works
of
art
of
the
past
in
their
reality
more
often
to
both
by
critic
is
sometimes
understood
in
a
more
restricted
sense
he
who
judges
and
describes
contemporary
literary
works
and
by
historian
he
who
treats
of
those
less
recent
these
are
linguistic
uses
and
empirical
distinctions
which
may
be
neglected
because
the
true
difference
lies
between
scholar
the
man
of
and
historian
of
these
words
designate
three
successive
stages
of
work
each
one
independent
relatively
to
the
one
that
follows
but
not
to
that
which
precedes
as
we
have
seen
a
man
may
be
a
mere
scholar
and
possess
little
capacity
for
understanding
works
of
art
he
may
even
both
be
learned
and
possess
taste
yet
be
unable
to
portray
them
by
writing
a
page
of
artistic
and
literary
history
but
the
true
and
complete
historian
while
containing
in
himself
both
the
scholar
and
the
man
of
taste
as
necessary
must
add
to
their
qualities
the
gift
of
historical
comprehension
and
representation
sidenote
method
of
artistic
and
literary
the
theory
of
artistic
and
literary
historical
method
presents
problems
and
difficulties
some
common
to
the
theory
of
historical
method
in
general
others
peculiar
to
it
because
derived
from
the
concept
of
art
itself
sidenote
of
the
problem
of
the
origin
of
history
is
commonly
divided
into
human
history
natural
history
and
the
mixture
of
both
without
examining
here
the
question
of
the
solidity
of
this
distinction
it
is
clear
that
artistic
and
literary
history
belongs
in
any
case
to
the
first
since
it
concerns
a
spiritual
activity
that
is
to
say
an
activity
proper
to
man
and
since
this
activity
is
its
subject
the
absurdity
of
propounding
the
historical
problem
of
the
of
becomes
at
once
evident
we
should
note
that
by
this
formula
many
different
things
have
in
turn
been
included
on
many
different
occasions
has
often
meant
or
of
the
artistic
fact
in
which
case
an
attempt
was
made
to
deal
with
a
real
scientific
or
philosophic
problem
the
very
problem
in
fact
which
our
treatise
has
attempted
to
solve
at
other
times
by
origin
has
been
understood
the
genesis
the
search
for
the
reason
of
art
the
deduction
of
the
artistic
fact
from
a
first
principle
containing
in
itself
both
spirit
and
nature
this
is
also
a
philosophical
problem
complementary
to
the
preceding
coinciding
indeed
with
it
although
it
has
sometimes
been
strangely
interpreted
and
solved
by
means
of
an
arbitrary
and
metaphysic
but
when
the
object
was
to
discover
further
exactly
in
what
way
the
artistic
function
was
formed
the
result
has
been
the
absurdity
which
we
have
mentioned
if
expression
be
the
first
form
of
consciousness
how
can
we
look
for
the
historical
origin
of
what
is
not
a
product
of
nature
and
is
presupposed
by
human
history
how
can
we
assign
a
historical
genesis
to
a
thing
which
is
a
category
by
means
of
which
all
historical
processes
and
facts
are
understood
the
absurdity
has
arisen
from
the
comparison
with
human
institutions
which
have
been
formed
in
the
course
of
history
and
have
disappeared
or
may
disappear
in
its
course
between
the
æsthetic
fact
and
a
human
institution
such
as
monogamic
marriage
or
the
fief
there
exists
a
difference
comparable
with
that
between
simple
and
compound
bodies
in
chemistry
it
is
impossible
to
indicate
the
formation
of
the
former
otherwise
they
would
not
be
simple
and
if
this
be
discovered
they
cease
to
be
simple
and
become
compound
the
problem
of
the
origin
of
art
historically
understood
is
only
justified
when
it
is
proposed
to
investigate
not
the
formation
of
the
artistic
category
but
where
and
when
art
has
appeared
for
the
first
time
appeared
that
is
to
say
in
a
striking
manner
at
what
point
or
in
what
region
of
the
globe
and
at
what
point
or
epoch
of
its
history
when
that
is
to
say
not
the
origin
of
art
but
its
earliest
or
primitive
history
is
the
object
of
research
this
problem
forms
one
with
that
of
the
appearance
of
human
civilization
on
the
earth
data
for
its
solution
are
certainly
wanting
but
there
yet
remains
the
abstract
possibility
of
a
solution
and
certainly
tentative
and
hypothetical
solutions
abound
sidenote
criterion
of
progress
and
every
representation
of
human
history
has
the
concept
of
as
foundation
but
by
progress
must
not
be
understood
the
imaginary
of
which
is
supposed
to
lead
the
generations
of
man
with
irresistible
force
to
some
unknown
destiny
according
to
a
providential
plan
which
we
can
divine
and
then
understand
logically
a
supposed
law
of
this
sort
is
the
negation
of
history
itself
of
that
accidentality
that
empiricity
that
contingency
which
distinguish
concrete
fact
from
abstraction
and
for
the
same
reason
progress
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
law
of
which
if
it
mean
that
reality
evolves
and
it
is
only
reality
in
so
far
as
it
evolves
or
becomes
can
not
be
called
a
law
and
if
it
be
given
as
a
law
becomes
identical
with
the
law
of
progress
in
the
sense
just
described
the
progress
of
which
we
speak
here
is
nothing
but
very
concept
of
human
activity
which
working
upon
the
material
supplied
to
it
by
nature
conquers
its
obstacles
and
bends
it
to
its
own
ends
such
conception
of
progress
that
is
to
say
of
human
activity
applied
to
a
given
material
is
the
of
of
the
historian
of
humanity
no
one
but
a
mere
collector
of
unrelated
facts
a
mere
antiquary
or
inconsequent
annalist
can
put
together
the
smallest
narrative
of
human
doings
unless
he
have
a
determined
point
of
view
that
is
to
say
a
personal
conviction
of
his
own
regarding
the
facts
whose
history
he
has
undertaken
to
relate
no
one
can
start
from
the
confused
and
discordant
mass
of
crude
facts
and
arrive
at
the
historical
work
of
art
save
by
means
of
this
apperception
which
makes
it
possible
to
carve
a
definite
representation
in
that
rough
and
formless
mass
the
historian
of
a
practical
action
should
know
what
is
economy
and
what
is
morality
the
historian
of
mathematics
what
is
mathematics
the
historian
of
botany
what
is
botany
the
historian
of
philosophy
what
is
philosophy
if
he
does
not
really
know
these
things
he
must
at
least
have
the
illusion
of
knowing
them
otherwise
he
will
not
even
be
able
to
delude
himself
into
believing
that
he
is
writing
history
we
can
not
here
expand
the
demonstration
of
the
necessity
and
inevitability
of
this
subjective
criterion
in
every
narrative
of
human
affairs
which
is
compatible
with
the
utmost
objectivity
impartiality
and
scrupulousness
in
dealing
with
data
of
fact
and
indeed
forms
a
constitutive
element
in
these
virtues
in
every
narrative
of
human
doings
and
happenings
it
suffices
to
read
any
book
of
history
to
discover
at
once
the
point
of
view
of
the
author
if
he
be
a
historian
worthy
of
the
name
and
know
his
own
business
there
are
liberal
and
reactionary
rationalist
and
catholic
historians
who
deal
with
political
or
social
history
for
the
history
of
philosophy
there
are
metaphysical
empirical

idealist
and
spiritualist

his

his
criterion

is
there
one
single
work
of
any
value
on
the
history
of

which
has
not
been
written
from
this
or
that
point

with
this
or
that
bias
hegelian
or
herbartian
from
a
sensationalist
or
from
an
eclectic
or
some
other
point
of
view
if
the
historian
is
to
escape
from
the
inevitable
necessity
of
taking
a
side
he
must
become
a
political
or
scientific
eunuch
and
history
is
not
an
occupation
for
eunuchs
such
would
at
most
be
of
use
in
compiling
those
great
tomes
of
not
useless
erudition
atque
fracta
which
are
called
not
without
reason
monkish
if
then
a
concept
of
progress
a
point
of
view
a
criterion
be
inevitable
the
best
to
be
done
is
not
to
try
and
escape
from
it
but
to
obtain
the
best
possible
every
one
tends
to
this
end
when
he
forms
his
own
convictions
seriously
and
laboriously
historians
who
profess
to
wish
to
interrogate
the
facts
without
adding
anything
of
their
own
to
them
are
not
to
be
trusted
this
is
at
best
the
result
of
ingenuousness
and
illusion
on
their
part
they
will
always
add
something
of
their
own
if
they
be
truly
historians
even
without
knowing
it
or
they
will
only
believe
that
they
have
avoided
doing
so
because
they
have
conveyed
it
only
by
hints
which
is
the
most
insinuating
penetrative
and
effective
of
methods
sidenote
of
a
single
line
of
progress
in
artistic
and
literary
artistic
and
literary
history
can
not
dispense
with
the
criterion
of
progress
any
more
easily
than
other
history
we
can
not
show
what
a
given
work
of
art
is
save
by
proceeding
from
a
conception
of
art
in
order
to
fix
the
artistic
problem
which
the
author
of
such
work
of
art
had
to
solve
and
by
determining
whether
or
no
he
has
solved
it
or
by
how
much
and
in
what
way
he
has
failed
to
do
so
but
it
is
important
to
note
that
the
criterion
of
progress
assumes
a
different
form
in
artistic
and
literary
history
to
that
which
it
assumes
or
is
believed
to
assume
in
the
history
of
science
it
is
customary
to
represent
the
whole
history
of
knowledge
by
one
single
line
of
progress
and
regress
science
is
the
universal
and
its
problems
are
arranged
in
one
single
vast
system
or
comprehensive
problem
all
thinkers
labour
upon
the
same
problem
as
to
the
nature
of
reality
and
of
knowledge
contemplative
indians
and
greek
philosophers
christians
and
mohammedans
bare
heads
and
turbaned
heads
wigged
heads
and
heads
as
heine
said
and
future
generations
will
weary
themselves
with
it
as
ours
has
done
it
would
take
too
long
to
inquire
here
if
this
be
true
or
not
of
science
but
it
is
certainly
not
true
of
art
art
is
intuition
and
intuition
is
individuality
and
individuality
does
not
repeat
itself
to
conceive
of
the
history
of
the
artistic
production
of
the
human
race
as
developed
along
a
single
line
of
progress
and
regress
would
therefore
be
altogether
erroneous
at
the
most
and
working
to
some
extent
with
generalizations
and
abstractions
it
may
be
asserted
that
the
history
of
æsthetic
productions
shows
progressive
cycles
but
each
cycle
with
its
own
problem
and
each
progressive
only
in
respect
to
that
problem
when
many
are
at
work
in
a
general
way
upon
the
same
subject
without
succeeding
in
giving
to
it
the
suitable
form
yet
drawing
always
more
near
to
it
there
is
said
to
be
progress
and
when
appears
the
man
who
gives
it
definite
form
the
cycle
is
said
to
be
complete
and
progress
is
ended
a
typical
example
of
this
would
here
be
the
progress
in
the
elaboration
of
the
mode
of
using
the
of
chivalry
during
the
italian
renaissance
from
pulci
to
ariosto
using
this
as
an
example
and
excusing
excessive
simplification
nothing
but
repetition
and
imitation
diminution
or
exaggeration
a
spoiling
of
what
had
already
been
done
in
short
decadence
could
be
the
result
of
employing
that
same
material
after
ariosto
the
epigoni
of
ariosto
prove
this
progress
begins
with
the
beginning
of
a
new
cycle
cervantes
with
his
more
open
and
conscious
irony
is
an
instance
of
this
in
what
did
the
general
decadence
of
italian
literature
at
the
end
of
the
sixteenth
century
consist
simply
in
having
nothing
more
to
say
and
in
repeating
and
exaggerating
motives
already
discovered
if
the
italians
of
this
period
had
even
been
able
to
express
their
own
decadence
they
would
not
have
been
altogether
failures
but
would
have
anticipated
the
literary
movement
of
the
risorgimento
where
the
matter
is
not
the
same
a
progressive
cycle
does
not
exist
shakespeare
does
not
represent
an
advance
on
dante
nor
goethe
upon
shakespeare
dante
however
represents
an
advance
on
the
visionaries
of
the
middle
ages
shakespeare
on
the
elizabethan
dramatists
goethe
with
and
the
first
part
of
on
the
writers
of
the
und
period
this
mode
of
presenting
the
history
of
poetry
and
art
contains
however
as
we
have
remarked
something
of
the
abstract
of
the
merely
practical
and
is
without
strict
philosophical
value
not
only
is
the
art
of
savages
not
inferior
as
art
to
that
of
civilized
peoples
if
it
be
correlative
to
the
impressions
of
the
savage
but
every
individual
indeed
every
moment
of
the
spiritual
life
of
an
individual
has
its
artistic
world
none
of
these
worlds
can
be
compared
with
any
other
in
respect
of
artistic
value
sidenote
committed
against
this
many
have
sinned
and
continue
to
sin
against
this
special
form
of
the
criterion
of
progress
in
artistic
and
literary
history
some
for
instance
talk
of
the
infancy
of
italian
art
in
giotto
and
of
its
maturity
in
raphæl
or
in
titian
as
though
giotto
were
not
complete
and
absolutely
perfect
granted
the
material
of
feeling
with
which
his
mind
was
furnished
he
was
certainly
incapable
of
drawing
a
figure
like
raphæl
or
of
colouring
it
like
titian
but
was
raphæl
or
titian
capable
of
creating
the
of
saint
francis
with
or
the
of
saint
the
spirit
of
giotto
had
not
felt
the
attraction
of
the
body
beautiful
which
the
renaissance
studied
and
raised
to
a
place
of
honour
the
spirits
of
raphæl
and
of
titian
were
no
longer
interested
in
certain
movements
of
ardour
and
of
tenderness
with
which
the
man
of
the
fourteenth
century
was
in
love
how
then
can
a
comparison
be
made
where
there
is
no
comparative
term
the
celebrated
divisions
of
the
history
of
art
into
an
oriental
period
representing
a
lack
of
equilibrium
between
idea
and
form
the
latter
dominating
a
classical
representing
an
equilibrium
between
idea
and
form
a
romantic
representing
a
new
lack
of
equilibrium
between
idea
and
form
the
former
dominating
suffer
from
the
same
defect
the
same
is
true
of
the
division
into
oriental
art
representing
imperfection
of
form
classical
perfection
of
form
romantic
or
modern
perfection
of
content
and
of
form
thus
classic
and
romantic
have
also
received
among
their
many
other
meanings
that
of
progressive
or
regressive
periods
in
respect
to
the
realization
of
some
alleged
artistic
ideal
of
all
humanity
sidenote
meanings
of
the
word
progress
in
respect
to
there
is
no
such
thing
then
as
an
progress
of
humanity
however
by
æsthetic
progress
is
sometimes
meant
not
what
the
two
words
coupled
together
really
signify
but
the
accumulation
of
our
historical
knowledge
which
makes
us
able
to
sympathize
with
all
the
artistic
products
of
all
peoples
and
of
all
times
or
as
they
say
makes
our
taste
more
catholic
the
difference
appears
very
great
if
the
eighteenth
century
so
incapable
of
escaping
from
itself
be
compared
with
our
own
time
which
enjoys
alike
greek
and
roman
art
now
better
understood
byzantine
mediæval
arabic
and
renaissance
art
the
art
of
the
cinquecento
baroque
art
and
the
art
of
the
eighteenth
century
egyptian
babylonian
etruscan
and
even
prehistoric
art
are
more
profoundly
studied
every
day
certainly
the
difference
between
the
savage
and
civilized
man
does
not
lie
in
the
human
faculties
the
savage
has
speech
intellect
religion
and
morality
in
common
with
civilized
man
and
is
a
complete
man
the
only
difference
lies
in
this
that
civilized
man
penetrates
and
dominates
a
larger
portion
of
the
universe
with
his
theoretic
and
practical
activity
we
can
not
claim
to
be
more
spiritually
alert
than
for
example
the
contemporaries
of
pericles
but
no
one
can
deny
that
we
are
richer
than
they
rich
with
their
riches
and
with
those
of
how
many
other
peoples
and
generations
besides
our
own
by
æsthetic
progress
is
also
meant
in
another
sense
which
is
also
improper
the
greater
abundance
of
artistic
intuitions
and
the
smaller
number
of
imperfect
or
inferior
works
which
one
epoch
produces
in
respect
to
another
thus
it
may
be
said
that
there
was
æsthetic
progress
an
artistic
awakening
in
italy
at
the
end
of
the
thirteenth
or
of
the
fifteenth
century
finally
æsthetic
progress
is
talked
of
in
a
third
sense
with
an
eye
to
the
refinement
and
complications
of
exhibited
in
the
works
of
art
of
the
most
civilized
peoples
as
compared
with
those
of
less
civilized
peoples
barbarians
and
savages
but
in
this
case
the
progress
is
of
the
comprehensive
conditions
not
of
the
artistic
activity
to
which
the
material
is
indifferent
these
are
the
most
important
points
to
note
concerning
the
method
of
artistic
and
literary
history
xviii
conclusion
identity
of
linguistic
and
æsthetic
sidenote
of
the
a
glance
over
the
path
traversed
will
show
that
we
have
completed
the
entire
programme
of
our
treatise
we
have
studied
the
nature
of
intuitive
or
expressive
knowledge
which
is
the
æsthetic
or
artistic
fact
and
ii
and
described
the
other
form
of
knowledge
the
intellectual
and
the
successive
complications
of
these
forms
iii
it
thus
became
possible
for
us
to
criticize
all
erroneous
æsthetic
theories
arising
from
the
confusion
between
the
various
forms
and
from
the
illicit
transference
of
the
characteristics
of
one
form
to
another
iv
noting
at
the
same
time
the
opposite
errors
to
be
found
in
the
theory
of
intellectual
knowledge
and
of
historiography
passing
on
to
examine
the
relations
between
the
æsthetic
activity
and
the
other
activities
of
the
spirit
no
longer
theoretic
but
practical
we
indicated
the
true
character
of
the
practical
activity
and
the
place
which
it
occupies
in
respect
to
the
theoretic
activity
hence
the
criticism
of
the
intrusion
into
æsthetic
theory
of
practical
concepts
vi
we
have
distinguished
the
two
forms
of
the
practical
activity
as
economic
and
ethical
vii
reaching
the
conclusion
that
there
are
no
other
forms
of
the
spirit
beyond
the
four
which
we
have
analyzed
hence
viii
the
criticism
of
every
mystical
or
imaginative
æsthetic
and
since
there
are
no
other
spiritual
forms
with
these
so
there
are
no
original
subdivisions
of
the
four
established
and
in
particular
of
æsthetic
from
this
arises
the
impossibility
of
classes
of
expressions
and
the
criticism
of
rhetoric
that
is
of
ornate
expression
distinct
from
simple
expression
and
of
other
similar
distinctions
and
subdistinctions
ix
but
by
the
law
of
the
unity
of
the
spirit
the
æsthetic
fact
is
also
a
practical
fact
and
as
such
occasions
pleasure
and
pain
this
led
us
to
study
f
the
feelings
of
value
in
general
and
those
of
æsthetic
value
or
of
the
beautiful
in
particular
x
to
criticize
æsthetic
hedonism
in
all
its
various
manifestations
and
complications
xi
and
to
expel
from
the
system
of
æsthetic
the
long
series
of
psychological
concepts
which
had
been
introduced
into
it
proceeding
from
æsthetic
production
to
the
facts
of
reproduction
we
began
by
investigating
the
external
fixing
of
the
æsthetic
expression
for
the
purpose
of
reproduction
this
is
called
the
physically
beautiful
whether
natural
or
artificial
we
derived
from
this
distinction
the
criticism
of
the
errors
which
arise
from
confounding
the
physical
with
the
æsthetic
side
of
facts
we
determined
the
meaning
of
artistic
technique
or
that
technique
which
is
at
the
service
of
reproduction
thus
criticizing
the
divisions
limits
and
classifications
of
the
individual
arts
and
establishing
the
relations
of
art
economy
and
morality
since
the
existence
of
physical
objects
does
not
suffice
to
stimulate
æsthetic
reproduction
to
the
full
and
since
in
order
to
obtain
it
we
must
recall
the
conditions
in
which
the
stimulus
first
operated
we
have
also
studied
the
function
of
historical
erudition
directed
toward
the
communication
between
the
imagination
and
the
works
of
the
past
and
to
serve
as
the
basis
of
the
æsthetic
judgement
we
have
concluded
our
treatise
by
showing
how
the
reproduction
thus
obtained
is
afterwards
elaborated
by
the
categories
of
thought
that
is
to
say
by
an
examination
of
the
method
of
literary
and
artistic
history
the
æsthetic
fact
has
in
short
been
considered
both
in
itself
and
in
its
relations
with
the
other
spiritual
activities
with
the
feelings
of
pleasure
and
pain
with
what
are
called
physical
facts
with
memory
and
with
historical
treatment
it
has
passed
before
us
as
until
it
became
that
is
to
say
from
the
moment
of
until
it
becomes
gradually
changed
for
the
spirit
into
of
our
treatise
may
appear
to
be
somewhat
meagre
when
externally
compared
with
the
great
volumes
usually
dedicated
to
æsthetic
but
it
will
not
seem
so
when
we
perceive
that
those
volumes
are
full
of
matter
that
is
not
pertinent
such
as
definitions
psychological
or
metaphysical
of
concepts
the
sublime
the
comic
the
tragic
the
humorous
etc
or
of
the
exposition
of
the
supposed
zoology
botany
and
mineralogy
of
æsthetic
and
of
universal
history
æsthetically
judged
that
the
whole
history
of
concrete
art
and
literature
has
also
been
dragged
into
those
æsthetics
and
generally
mangled
and
that
they
contain
judgements
upon
homer
and
dante
ariosto
and
shakespeare
beethoven
and
rossini
michæl
angelo
and
raphæl
when
all
this
has
been
deducted
from
them
we
flatter
ourselves
that
our
treatise
will
no
longer
be
held
to
be
too
meagre
but
on
the
contrary
far
richer
than
ordinary
treatises
which
either
omit
altogether
or
hardly
touch
at
all
the
greater
part
of
the
difficult
problems
proper
to
æsthetic
which
we
have
felt
it
to
be
our
duty
to
study
sidenote
of
linguistic
and
but
although
æsthetic
as
science
of
expression
has
been
studied
by
us
in
its
every
aspect
it
remains
to
justify
the
which
we
have
added
to
the
title
of
our
book
linguistic
to
state
and
make
clear
the
thesis
that
the
science
of
art
and
that
of
language
æsthetic
and
linguistic
conceived
as
true
sciences
are
not
two
distinct
things
but
one
thing
only
not
that
there
is
a
special
linguistic
but
the
science
of
language
general
linguistic
so
far
as
what
it
contains
is
reducible
to
philosophy
is
nothing
but
æsthetic
whoever
studies
general
linguistic
that
is
to
say
philosophical
linguistic
studies
æsthetic
problems
and
versa
philosophy
of
language
and
philosophy
of
art
are
the
same
were
linguistic
really
a
science
from
æsthetic
it
would
not
have
for
its
object
expression
which
is
the
essentially
æsthetic
fact
that
is
to
say
we
must
deny
that
language
is
expression
but
an
emission
of
sounds
which
expresses
nothing
is
not
language
language
is
sound
articulated
circumscribed
and
organized
for
the
purposes
of
expression
if
on
the
other
hand
linguistic
were
a
science
in
respect
to
æsthetic
it
would
necessarily
have
for
its
object
a
of
expressions
but
the
of
classes
of
expression
is
a
point
which
we
have
already
demonstrated
sidenote
formulation
of
linguistic
problems
nature
of
the
problems
which
linguistic
tries
to
solve
and
the
errors
in
which
linguistic
has
been
and
is
involved
are
the
same
that
respectively
occupy
and
complicate
æsthetic
if
it
be
not
always
easy
it
is
on
the
other
hand
always
possible
to
reduce
the
philosophic
questions
of
linguistic
to
their
æsthetic
formula
the
disputes
themselves
as
to
the
nature
of
the
one
find
their
parallel
in
those
as
to
the
nature
of
the
other
thus
it
has
been
disputed
whether
linguistic
be
a
historical
or
a
scientific
discipline
and
the
scientific
having
been
distinguished
from
the
historical
it
has
been
asked
whether
it
belong
to
the
order
of
the
natural
or
of
the
psychological
sciences
understanding
by
these
latter
empirical
psychology
as
well
as
the
sciences
of
the
spirit
the
same
has
happened
with
æsthetic
which
some
have
looked
upon
as
a
natural
science
confusing
the
æsthetic
and
the
physical
sense
of
the
word
expression
others
have
looked
upon
it
as
a
psychological
science
confusing
expression
in
its
universality
with
the
empirical
classification
of
expressions
others
again
denying
the
very
possibility
of
a
science
of
such
a
subject
change
it
into
a
simple
collection
of
historical
facts
not
one
of
these
attaining
to
the
consciousness
of
æsthetic
as
a
science
of
activity
or
of
value
a
science
of
the
spirit
linguistic
expression
or
speech
has
often
seemed
to
be
a
fact
of
which
belongs
to
the
physical
expressions
of
the
feelings
common
alike
to
men
and
animals
but
it
was
soon
perceived
that
an
abyss
yawns
between
the
ah
which
is
a
physical
reflex
of
pain
and
a
word
as
also
between
that
ah
of
pain
and
the
ah
employed
as
a
word
the
theory
of
the
interjection
being
abandoned
jocosely
termed
the
ah
ah
theory
by
german
linguists
the
theory
of
or
appeared
this
is
liable
to
the
same
objection
which
destroyed
æsthetic
associationism
in
general
speech
is
unity
not
multiplicity
of
images
and
multiplicity
does
not
explain
but
indeed
presupposes
the
expression
to
be
explained
a
variant
of
linguistic
associationism
is
the
imitative
that
is
to
say
the
theory
of
which
the
same
philologists
deride
under
the
name
of
the
theory
from
the
imitation
of
the
dog
bark
which
according
to
the
onomatopœists
must
have
given
its
name
to
the
dog
the
most
usual
theory
of
our
times
as
regards
language
apart
from
mere
crass
naturalism
consists
of
a
sort
of
eclecticism
or
mixture
of
the
various
theories
to
which
we
have
referred
it
is
assumed
that
language
is
in
part
the
product
of
interjections
and
in
part
of
onomatopœia
and
convention
this
doctrine
is
altogether
worthy
of
the
philosophical
decadence
of
the
second
half
of
the
nineteenth
century
sidenote
of
language
and
its
we
must
here
note
an
error
into
which
have
fallen
those
very
philologists
who
have
best
discerned
the
activistic
nature
of
language
when
they
maintain
that
although
language
was
a
spiritual
creation
yet
that
it
afterwards
increased
by
but
the
distinction
does
not
hold
for
origin
in
this
case
can
not
mean
anything
but
nature
or
character
and
if
language
be
spiritual
creation
it
must
always
be
creation
if
it
be
association
it
must
have
been
so
from
the
beginning
the
error
has
arisen
from
having
failed
to
grasp
the
general
principle
of
æsthetic
known
to
us
that
expressions
already
produced
must
descend
to
the
rank
of
impressions
before
they
can
give
rise
to
new
impressions
when
we
utter
new
words
we
generally
transform
the
old
ones
varying
or
enlarging
their
meaning
but
this
process
is
not
associative
it
is
although
the
creation
has
for
material
the
impressions
not
of
the
hypothetical
primitive
man
but
of
man
who
has
lived
long
ages
in
society
and
who
has
so
to
say
stored
so
many
things
in
his
psychic
organism
and
among
them
so
much
language
sidenote
between
grammar
and
the
question
of
the
distinction
between
the
æsthetic
and
the
intellectual
fact
appears
in
linguistic
as
that
of
the
relations
between
grammar
and
logic
this
problem
has
been
solved
in
two
partially
true
ways
the
and
the
of
logic
and
grammar
but
the
complete
solution
is
this
if
the
logical
form
be
inseparable
from
the
grammatical
æsthetic
the
grammatical
is
separable
from
the
logical
sidenote
kinds
or
parts
of
if
we
look
at
a
picture
which
for
instance
portrays
a
man
walking
on
a
country
road
we
may
say
this
picture
represents
a
fact
of
which
if
conceived
as
voluntary
is
called
and
since
every
movement
implies
a
object
and
every
action
a
that
acts
this
picture
also
represents
a
or
but
this
movement
takes
place
in
a
definite
place
which
is
a
piece
of
a
definite
heavenly
body
the
earth
and
precisely
of
a
piece
of
it
which
is
called
and
more
precisely
of
a
part
of
it
that
is
wooded
and
covered
with
grass
which
is
called
cut
naturally
or
artificially
into
a
form
called
now
there
is
only
one
example
of
that
star
which
is
called
earth
the
earth
is
an
but
country
are
genera
or
because
there
are
other
other
countries
other
roads
and
it
would
be
possible
to
continue
for
a
while
with
similar
considerations
by
substituting
a
phrase
for
the
picture
that
we
have
imagined
for
example
one
to
this
effect
peter
is
walking
on
a
country
road
and
by
making
the
same
remarks
we
obtain
the
concepts
of
motion
or
action
of
material
object
or
agent
of
noun
of
noun
and
so
on
what
have
we
done
in
both
cases
neither
more
nor
less
than
submit
to
logical
elaboration
what
first
presented
itself
only
æsthetically
that
is
to
say
we
have
destroyed
the
æsthetic
for
the
logical
but
since
in
general
æsthetic
error
begins
when
we
wish
to
return
from
the
logical
to
the
æsthetic
and
ask
what
is
the
of
motion
action
matter
being
of
the
general
of
the
individual
etc
so
in
the
case
of
language
error
begins
when
motion
or
action
are
called
being
or
matter
or
and
when
linguistic
categories
or
of
speech
are
made
of
all
these
noun
and
verb
and
so
on
the
theory
of
the
parts
of
speech
is
really
identical
with
that
of
artistic
and
literary
kinds
already
criticized
in
our
æsthetic
it
is
false
to
say
that
the
verb
or
noun
is
expressed
in
definite
words
truly
distinguishable
from
others
expression
is
an
indivisible
whole
noun
and
verb
do
not
exist
in
it
but
are
abstractions
made
by
us
destroying
the
sole
linguistic
reality
which
is
the
this
last
is
to
be
understood
not
in
the
way
common
to
grammars
but
as
an
organism
expressive
of
a
complete
meaning
which
includes
alike
the
simplest
exclamation
and
a
great
poem
this
sounds
paradoxical
but
is
nevertheless
the
simplest
truth
and
since
in
æsthetic
the
artistic
productions
of
certain
peoples
have
been
looked
upon
as
imperfect
owing
to
the
error
above
mentioned
because
the
supposed
kinds
have
seemed
not
yet
to
have
been
discriminated
or
to
be
in
part
wanting
so
in
linguistic
the
theory
of
the
parts
of
speech
has
caused
the
analogous
error
of
judging
languages
as
and
according
to
whether
there
appear
in
them
or
no
some
of
those
supposed
parts
of
speech
for
example
the
verb
sidenote
individuality
of
speech
and
the
classification
of
linguistic
also
discovered
the
irreducible
individuality
of
the
æsthetic
fact
when
it
affirmed
that
the
word
is
what
is
really
spoken
and
that
two
truly
identical
words
do
not
exist
thus
were
synonyms
and
homonyms
destroyed
and
thus
was
shown
the
impossibility
of
really
translating
one
word
into
another
from
dialect
into
language
or
from
the
into
the
foreign
tongue
but
the
attempt
to
classify
languages
ill
agrees
with
this
just
view
languages
have
no
reality
beyond
the
propositions
and
complexes
of
propositions
really
written
and
pronounced
by
given
peoples
at
definite
periods
that
is
to
say
they
have
no
existence
outside
the
works
of
art
whether
little
or
great
oral
or
written
soon
forgotten
or
long
remembered
does
not
matter
in
which
they
exist
concretely
and
what
is
the
art
of
a
given
people
but
the
whole
of
its
artistic
products
what
is
the
character
of
an
art
for
example
of
greek
art
or
provençal
literature
but
the
whole
physiognomy
of
those
products
and
how
can
such
a
question
be
answered
save
by
narrating
in
its
particulars
the
history
of
the
literature
that
is
to
say
of
the
language
in
its
actuality
it
may
be
thought
that
this
argument
although
possessing
validity
as
against
many
of
the
usual
classifications
of
languages
yet
is
without
any
as
regards
that
queen
of
classifications
the
that
glory
of
comparative
philology
and
this
it
certainly
is
but
why
precisely
because
that
method
is
not
a
mere
classification
he
who
writes
history
does
not
classify
and
the
philologists
themselves
have
hastened
to
say
that
languages
which
can
be
arranged
in
historical
series
those
whose
series
have
hitherto
been
traced
are
not
distinct
and
separate
species
but
a
single
whole
of
facts
in
the
various
phases
of
its
development
sidenote
of
a
normative
language
has
sometimes
been
regarded
as
a
voluntary
or
arbitrary
act
but
at
others
the
impossibility
of
creating
language
artificially
by
an
act
of
will
has
been
clearly
seen
caesar
civitatem
dare
potes
homini
verbo
non
was
once
said
to
a
roman
emperor
and
the
æsthetic
and
therefore
theoretic
as
opposed
to
practical
nature
of
expression
supplies
the
method
of
discovering
the
scientific
error
which
lies
in
the
conception
of
a
normative
establishing
the
rules
of
correct
speech
good
sense
has
always
rebelled
against
this
error
an
example
of
such
rebellion
is
the
so
much
the
worse
for
grammar
attributed
to
monsieur
de
voltaire
but
the
impossibility
of
a
normative
grammar
is
also
recognized
by
those
who
teach
it
when
they
confess
that
to
write
well
can
not
be
learned
by
rules
that
there
are
no
rules
without
exceptions
and
that
the
study
of
grammar
should
be
conducted
practically
by
reading
and
examples
which
should
form
the
literary
taste
the
scientific
reason
of
this
impossibility
lies
in
the
principle
that
we
have
demonstrated
that
a
technique
of
the
theoretical
amounts
to
a
contradiction
in
terms
and
what
could
a
normative
grammar
be
but
precisely
a
technique
of
linguistic
expression
that
is
to
say
of
a
theoretic
fact
sidenote
the
case
in
which
grammar
is
understood
merely
as
an
empirical
discipline
that
is
to
say
as
a
collection
of
schemes
useful
for
learning
languages
without
any
claim
whatever
to
philosophic
truth
is
quite
different
even
the
abstractions
of
the
parts
of
speech
are
in
this
case
both
admissible
and
useful
and
we
must
tolerate
as
merely
didascalic
many
books
entitled
treatises
of
linguistic
where
we
generally
find
a
little
of
everything
from
the
description
of
the
vocal
apparatus
and
of
the
artificial
machines
phonographs
which
can
imitate
it
to
summaries
of
the
most
important
i
results
obtained
by
semitic
coptic
chinese
or
other
philologies
from
philosophical
generalizations
as
to
the
origin
or
nature
of
language
to
advice
on
format
calligraphy
and
the
arrangement
of
notes
relating
to
philological
work
but
this
mass
of
notions
here
administered
in
a
fragmentary
and
incomplete
manner
about
language
in
its
essence
about
language
as
expression
resolves
itself
into
notions
of
æsthetic
nothing
exists
outside
which
gives
knowledge
of
the
nature
of
language
and
grammar
which
is
a
pedagogic
expedient
save
the
of
in
their
living
reality
that
is
to
say
the
history
of
concrete
literary
productions
which
is
substantially
identical
with
the
of
sidenote
linguistic
facts
or
the
same
error
of
taking
the
physical
for
the
æsthetic
from
which
the
search
for
the
of
the
beautiful
originates
is
made
by
those
who
go
in
search
of
linguistic
facts
decorating
with
that
name
the
divisions
of
the
longer
series
of
physical
sounds
into
shorter
series
syllables
vowels
and
consonants
and
the
series
of
syllables
called
words
all
these
elements
of
speech
which
give
no
definite
sense
when
taken
alone
must
be
called
not
of
language
but
mere
sounds
or
rather
sounds
abstracted
and
classified
physically
another
error
of
the
same
sort
is
that
of
to
which
the
most
distinguished
philologists
now
accord
but
small
value
having
confused
physical
with
linguistic
or
expressive
facts
and
considering
that
the
simple
precedes
the
complex
in
the
order
of
ideas
they
necessarily
ended
by
thinking
that
the
smallest
physical
facts
indicated
the
simplest
linguistic
facts
hence
the
imaginary
necessity
that
the
most
ancient
primitive
languages
had
a
monosyllabic
character
and
that
historical
research
must
always
lead
to
the
discovery
of
monosyllabic
roots
but
to
follow
up
the
imaginary
hypothesis
the
first
expression
that
the
first
man
conceived
may
have
had
not
a
phonetic
but
a
mimetic
physical
reflex
may
have
been
externalized
not
in
a
sound
but
in
a
gesture
and
assuming
that
it
was
externalized
in
a
sound
there
is
no
reason
to
suppose
that
sound
to
have
been
monosyllabic
rather
than
polysyllabic
philologists
readily
blame
their
own
ignorance
and
impotence
when
they
do
not
always
succeed
in
reducing
polysyllabism
to
monosyllabism
and
rely
upon
the
future
to
accomplish
the
reduction
but
their
faith
is
without
foundation
and
their
blame
of
themselves
is
an
act
of
humility
arising
from
an
erroneous
presumption
for
the
rest
the
limits
of
syllables
as
those
of
words
are
altogether
arbitrary
and
distinguished
somehow
or
other
by
empirical
use
primitive
speech
or
the
speech
of
uneducated
man
is
a
unaccompanied
by
any
consciousness
of
divisions
of
the
discourse
into
words
or
syllables
imaginary
beings
created
by
schools
no
true
law
of
linguistic
can
be
founded
on
such
divisions
proof
of
this
is
to
be
found
in
the
confession
of
linguists
that
there
are
no
truly
phonetic
laws
of
the
hiatus
of
cacophony
of
diæresis
or
synæresis
but
merely
laws
of
taste
and
convenience
that
is
to
say
laws
and
what
are
laws
of
which
are
not
at
the
same
time
laws
of
sidenote
judgement
and
the
model
finally
the
search
for
a
language
or
for
a
method
of
reducing
linguistic
usage
to
arises
from
the
superstition
of
a
rationalistic
measure
of
the
beautiful
from
that
concept
which
we
have
called
false
æsthetic
absoluteness
in
italy
we
call
this
the
question
of
the
of
the
language
is
perpetual
creation
what
has
been
linguistically
expressed
is
not
repeated
save
by
reproduction
of
what
has
already
been
produced
the
impressions
give
rise
to
continuous
changes
of
sound
and
meaning
that
is
to
expressions
to
seek
the
model
language
then
is
to
seek
the
immobility
of
motion
everyone
speaks
and
should
speak
according
to
the
echoes
which
things
arouse
in
his
soul
that
is
according
to
his
impressions
it
is
not
without
reason
that
the
most
convinced
supporter
of
any
one
of
the
solutions
of
the
problem
of
the
unity
of
language
whether
by
adopting
a
standard
italian
approximating
to
latin
or
to
usage
or
to
the
florentine
dialect
feels
repugnance
in
applying
his
theory
when
he
is
speaking
to
communicate
his
thoughts
and
to
make
himself
understood
the
reason
is
that
he
feels
that
in
substituting
the
latin
italian
or
florentine
word
for
that
of
different
origin
but
which
answers
to
his
natural
impressions
he
would
be
falsifying
the
genuine
form
of
truth
he
would
become
a
vain
listener
to
himself
instead
of
a
speaker
a
pedant
in
place
of
a
serious
man
an
actor
instead
of
a
sincere
person
to
write
according
to
a
theory
is
not
really
to
write
at
the
most
it
is
making
the
question
of
the
unity
of
language
is
always
reappearing
because
stated
as
it
is
it
is
insoluble
being
based
upon
a
false
conception
of
what
language
is
language
is
not
an
arsenal
of
arms
already
made
and
it
is
not
a
a
collection
of
abstractions
or
a
cemetery
of
corpses
more
or
less
well
embalmed
our
dismissal
of
the
question
of
the
model
language
or
of
the
unity
of
the
language
may
seem
somewhat
abrupt
and
yet
we
would
not
wish
to
appear
otherwise
than
respectful
towards
the
long
line
of
literary
men
who
have
debated
this
question
in
italy
for
centuries
but
those
ardent
debates
were
fundamentally
concerned
with
debates
of
æstheticity
not
of
æsthetic
science
of
literature
rather
than
of
literary
theory
of
effective
speaking
and
writing
not
of
linguistic
science
their
error
consisted
in
transforming
the
manifestation
of
a
need
into
a
scientific
thesis
the
desirability
for
example
of
easier
mutual
understanding
among
a
people
divided
by
dialects
into
the
philosophic
demand
for
a
single
ideal
language
such
a
search
was
as
absurd
as
that
other
search
for
a
language
a
language
possessing
the
immobility
of
the
concept
and
of
abstraction
the
social
need
for
a
better
understanding
of
one
another
can
not
be
satisfied
save
by
the
spread
of
education
becoming
general
by
the
increase
of
communications
and
by
the
interchange
of
thought
among
men
sidenote
these
scattered
observations
must
suffice
to
show
that
all
the
scientific
problems
of
linguistic
are
the
same
as
those
of
æsthetic
and
that
the
truths
and
errors
of
the
one
are
the
truths
and
errors
of
the
other
if
linguistic
and
æsthetic
appear
to
be
two
different
sciences
this
arises
from
the
fact
that
people
think
of
the
former
as
grammar
or
as
a
mixture
between
philosophy
and
grammar
that
is
an
arbitrary
mnemonic
schematism
or
a
pedagogic
medley
and
not
of
a
rational
science
and
a
pure
philosophy
of
speaking
grammar
or
something
not
unconnected
with
grammar
also
introduces
into
the
mind
the
prejudice
that
the
reality
of
language
lies
in
isolated
and
combinable
words
not
in
living
discourse
in
the
expressive
organisms
rationally
indivisible
those
linguists
or
philologists
philosophically
endowed
who
have
penetrated
deepest
into
the
problems
of
language
find
themselves
to
employ
a
trite
but
effective
simile
like
workmen
piercing
a
tunnel
at
a
certain
point
they
must
hear
the
voices
of
their
companions
the
philosophers
of
æsthetic
who
have
been
at
work
on
the
other
side
at
a
certain
stage
of
scientific
elaboration
linguistic
in
so
far
as
it
is
philosophy
must
merge
itself
in
æsthetic
and
this
indeed
it
does
without
leaving
a
residue
ii
history
of
æsthetic
i
æsthetic
ideas
in
antiquity
sidenote
of
view
of
this
history
of
the
question
whether
æsthetic
is
to
be
considered
as
an
ancient
or
a
modern
science
has
on
several
occasions
been
a
matter
of
controversy
whether
that
is
to
say
it
arose
for
the
first
time
in
the
eighteenth
century
or
had
previously
arisen
in
the
world
this
is
a
question
not
only
of
facts
but
of
criteria
as
is
easily
to
be
understood
whether
one
answers
it
in
this
way
or
that
depends
upon
one
idea
of
that
science
an
idea
afterwards
adopted
as
a
standard
or
criterion
our
view
is
that
æsthetic
is
the
of
the
representative
or
imaginative
in
our
opinion
therefore
it
does
not
appear
until
a
precise
concept
is
formulated
of
imagination
representation
or
expression
or
in
whatever
other
manner
we
prefer
to
name
that
attitude
of
the
spirit
which
is
theoretical
but
not
intellectual
a
producer
of
knowledge
but
of
the
individual
not
of
the
universal
outside
this
point
of
view
we
for
our
part
are
not
able
to
discover
anything
but
deviations
and
errors
these
deviations
can
lead
in
various
directions
following
the
distinctions
and
terminology
of
an
eminent
italian
philosopher
in
an
analogous
case
we
shall
be
inclined
to
say
that
they
arise
either
from
or
from
the
deviation
from
defect
would
be
that
which
denies
the
existence
of
a
special
æsthetic
and
imaginative
activity
or
which
amounts
to
the
same
thing
denies
its
autonomy
and
thus
mutilates
the
reality
of
the
spirit
deviation
by
excess
is
that
which
substitutes
for
it
or
imposes
upon
it
another
activity
altogether
undiscoverable
in
the
experience
of
the
interior
life
a
mysterious
activity
which
does
not
really
exist
both
these
deviations
as
can
be
deduced
from
the
theoretical
part
of
this
work
take
various
forms
the
first
that
due
to
defect
may
be
hedonistic
in
so
far
as
it
considers
and
accepts
art
as
a
simple
fact
of
sensuous
pleasure
in
so
far
as
looking
upon
it
in
the
same
way
it
declares
it
to
be
irreconcilable
with
the
highest
life
of
man
or
in
so
far
as
it
consents
to
a
compromise
and
while
still
considering
art
to
be
a
fact
of
sense
declares
that
it
need
not
be
harmful
indeed
that
it
may
render
some
service
to
morality
provided
always
that
it
is
submissive
and
obedient
the
forms
of
the
second
deviation
which
we
shall
call
mystical
are
not
determinable
priori
for
they
belong
to
feeling
and
imagination
in
their
infinite
variety
and
shades
of
meaning
sidenote
tendencies
and
attempts
towards
an
æsthetic
in
the
world
presents
all
these
fundamental
forms
of
deviation
pure
hedonism
moralism
or
pedagogism
mysticism
and
together
with
them
the
most
solemn
and
celebrated
rigoristic
negation
of
art
which
has
ever
been
made
it
also
exhibits
attempts
at
the
theory
of
expression
or
pure
imagination
but
nothing
more
than
approaches
and
attempts
hence
since
we
must
now
take
sides
in
the
controversy
as
to
whether
æsthetic
is
an
ancient
or
modern
science
we
can
not
but
place
ourselves
upon
the
side
of
those
who
affirm
its
modernity
a
rapid
glance
at
the
theories
of
antiquity
will
suffice
to
justify
what
we
have
said
we
say
rapid
because
to
enter
into
minute
particulars
collecting
all
the
scattered
observations
of
ancient
writers
upon
art
would
be
to
do
again
what
has
been
done
many
times
and
sometimes
very
well
further
those
ideas
propositions
and
theories
have
passed
into
the
common
patrimony
of
knowledge
together
with
what
else
remains
of
the
classical
world
it
is
therefore
more
advisable
here
than
in
any
other
part
of
this
history
merely
to
indicate
the
general
lines
of
development
sidenote
origin
of
the
æsthetic
problem
in
greece
art
the
artistic
faculty
only
became
a
philosophical
problem
in
greece
after
the
sophistical
movement
and
as
a
consequence
of
the
socratic
dialectic
the
historians
of
literature
generally
point
to
the
origins
of
greek
æsthetic
in
the
first
appearance
of
criticism
and
reflection
upon
poetical
works
painting
and
sculpture
in
the
judgements
pronounced
on
the
occasion
of
poetical
competitions
in
the
observations
that
were
made
as
to
the
methods
of
the
different
artists
in
the
analogies
between
painting
and
poetry
as
expressed
in
the
sayings
attributed
to
simonides
and
sophocles
or
finally
in
the
appearance
of
that
word
which
served
to
group
together
the
various
arts
and
to
indicate
in
a
certain
way
their
relationship
the
word
mimesis
or
mimetic
μίμησις
which
oscillates
between
the
meaning
of
imitation
and
that
of
representation
others
make
the
origin
of
æsthetic
go
back
to
the
polemics
which
were
conducted
by
the
first
naturalistic
and
moralistic
philosophers
against
the
tales
fantasies
and
morals
of
poets
and
to
the
interpretations
of
the
hidden
meaning
υπόνοια
or
as
the
moderns
call
it
allegory
employed
to
defend
the
good
name
of
homer
and
of
the
other
poets
finally
to
the
between
philosophy
and
poetry
as
plato
was
afterwards
to
call
it
but
to
tell
the
truth
none
of
these
reflections
observations
and
arguments
implied
a
true
and
proper
philosophical
discussion
of
the
nature
of
art
nor
was
the
sophistical
movement
favourable
to
its
appearance
for
although
attention
was
at
that
time
certainly
given
to
internal
psychical
facts
yet
these
were
conceived
as
mere
phenomena
of
opinion
and
feeling
of
pleasure
and
pain
of
illusion
whim
or
caprice
and
where
there
is
no
true
and
no
false
no
good
and
no
evil
there
can
be
no
question
of
beautiful
and
ugly
nor
of
a
difference
between
the
true
and
the
beautiful
or
between
the
beautiful
and
the
good
the
most
one
has
in
that
case
is
the
general
problem
of
the
irrational
and
the
rational
but
not
that
of
the
nature
of
art
which
assumes
the
difference
between
rational
and
irrational
material
and
spiritual
mere
fact
and
value
to
have
been
already
stated
and
grasped
if
then
the
sophistical
period
was
the
necessary
antecedent
to
the
discoveries
of
socrates
the
æsthetic
problem
could
only
arise
after
socrates
and
it
did
indeed
arise
with
plato
author
of
the
first
or
indeed
of
the
only
really
great
negation
of
art
of
which
there
remains
documentary
proof
in
the
history
of
ideas
sidenote
rigoristic
is
art
mimesis
a
rational
or
an
irrational
fact
does
it
belong
to
the
noble
region
of
the
soul
where
philosophy
and
virtue
are
found
or
does
it
dwell
in
that
base
lower
sphere
with
sensuality
and
crude
passionality
this
is
the
question
asked
by
plato
who
thus
states
the
problem
of
æsthetic
for
the
first
time
the
sophist
gorgias
was
able
to
note
with
his
sceptical
acuteness
that
tragic
representation
is
a
deception
which
strangely
enough
turns
out
to
the
honour
both
of
him
who
deceives
and
of
him
who
is
deceived
in
which
it
is
shameful
not
to
know
how
to
deceive
oneself
and
not
to
let
oneself
be
deceived
with
that
remark
he
could
rest
content
that
was
for
him
a
fact
like
another
but
plato
the
philosopher
was
bound
to
solve
the
problem
if
it
were
a
deception
then
down
with
tragedy
and
the
rest
of
mimetic
productions
down
with
them
among
the
other
things
to
be
despised
among
the
animal
qualities
of
man
but
if
it
were
not
deception
what
was
it
what
place
did
art
occupy
among
the
lofty
activities
of
philosophy
and
of
good
action
the
answer
that
he
gave
is
well
known
mimetic
does
not
realize
the
ideas
that
is
to
say
the
truth
of
things
but
reproduces
natural
or
artificial
things
which
are
pale
shadows
of
them
it
is
a
diminution
of
a
diminution
a
work
art
then
does
not
belong
to
the
lofty
and
rational
region
of
the
soul
του
λογιστικοϋ
ἐν
ψυχή
but
to
the
sensual
it
is
not
a
strengthening
but
a
corruption
of
the
mind
λώβη
τής
διάνοιας
it
can
serve
only
sensual
pleasure
which
troubles
and
obscures
for
this
reason
mimetic
poetry
and
poets
must
be
excluded
from
the
perfect
republic
plato
is
the
most
consistent
example
of
those
who
do
not
succeed
in
discovering
any
other
form
of
knowledge
but
the
intellectual
it
was
correctly
observed
by
him
that
imitation
stops
at
natural
things
at
the
image
το
φάντασμα
and
does
not
reach
the
concept
logical
truth
άλήθεια
of
which
poets
and
painters
are
altogether
ignorant
but
his
error
consisted
in
believing
that
there
is
no
other
form
of
truth
below
the
intellectual
that
there
is
nothing
but
sensuality
and
passionality
outside
or
prior
to
the
intellect
that
which
discovers
the
ideas
certainly
the
fine
æsthetic
sense
of
plato
did
not
echo
that
depreciatory
judgement
of
art
he
himself
declared
that
he
would
have
been
very
glad
to
have
been
shown
how
to
justify
art
and
to
place
it
among
the
forms
of
the
spirit
but
since
none
was
able
to
give
him
this
assistance
and
since
art
with
its
that
yet
lacks
was
repugnant
to
his
ethical
consciousness
and
reason
compelled
him
ό
λόγος
ήρει
to
banish
it
and
place
it
with
its
peers
he
resolutely
obeyed
his
conscience
and
his
reason
sidenote
hedonism
and
others
were
not
troubled
with
these
scruples
and
although
art
was
always
looked
upon
as
a
mere
thing
of
pleasure
among
the
later
hedonistic
schools
of
various
sorts
among
rhetoricians
and
worldly
people
the
duty
of
combating
or
of
abolishing
it
was
not
felt
nevertheless
this
opposite
extreme
was
also
not
calculated
to
meet
with
the
endorsement
of
public
opinion
for
the
latter
if
tender
towards
art
is
no
less
tender
towards
rationality
and
morality
for
this
reason
both
rationalists
and
moralists
compelled
to
recognize
the
force
of
such
a
condemnation
as
plato
sought
for
a
compromise
a
half
measure
away
with
the
sensual
and
with
art
certainly
but
can
we
expel
the
sensual
and
the
pleasurable
without
more
ado
can
fragile
human
nature
nourish
itself
exclusively
with
the
strong
food
of
philosophy
and
morality
can
we
obtain
observance
of
the
true
and
of
the
good
from
the
young
and
from
the
people
without
allowing
them
at
the
same
time
some
amusement
and

something
of

in
him
is
he
not
to

with
the
same
precautions
is
there
not
a
risk
that
the
bow
will
break
these
considerations
prepared
the
way
for
the
justification
of
art
for
they
showed
that
if
it
were
not
rational
in
itself
it
could
on
the
other
hand
serve
a
rational
end
hence
the
search
for
the
of
art
which
takes
the
place
of
the
search
for
the
essence
or
when
art
had
been
lowered
to
the
level
of
a
simple
pleasurable
illusion
an
inebriation
of
the
senses
it
was
necessary
to
subordinate
the
practical
action
of
producing
such
an
illusion
and
inebriation
like
any
other
action
to
the
moral
end
art
being
deprived
of
any
dignity
of
its
own
was
obliged
to
assume
a
reflected
or
secondhand
dignity
thus
the
moralistic
and
pedagogic
theory
was
constructed
upon
a
hedonistic
basis
the
artist
who
for
the
pure
hedonist
was
comparable
to
a
became
for
the
moralist
a
hetaira
and
pedagogue
these
are
the
symbols
of
the
two
conceptions
of
art
that
were
disseminated
in
antiquity
and
the
second
was
grafted
upon
the
first
even
before
plato
peremptory
negation
had
directed
thought
to
this
way
of
issue
the
literary
criticism
of
aristophanes
was
already
full
of
the
pedagogic
idea
what
schoolmasters
are
to
children
poets
are
to
young
men
τοΐς

he
says
in
a
celebrated
verse
but
we
can
find
traces
of
it
in
plato
himself
in
the
dialogues
in
which
he
seems
to
withdraw
from
the
too
rigid
conclusions
of
the
and
in
aristotle
both
in
the
where
he
determines
the
use
of
music
in
education
and
perhaps
in
the
where
he
speaks
obscurely
of
a
tragical
although
as
regards
this
latter
it
is
not
to
be
altogether
denied
that
he
may
have
had
a
sort
of
glimpse
of
the
modern
idea
of
the
liberating
power
of
art
later
on
the
pedagogic
theory
takes
a
form
that
was
much
affected
by
the
stoics
strabo
develops
and
defends
this
at
great
length
in
the
introduction
to
his
geographical
work
where
he
combats
eratosthenes
who
has
made
poetry
consist
in
mere
pleasure
without
any
notion
of
teaching
strabo
on
the
contrary
maintained
the
opinion
of
the
ancients
that
it
was
a
first
philosophy
φιλοσοφίαν

πρωτήν
which
educated
young
men
for
life
and
created
customs
affections
and
actions
by
means
of
pleasure
therefore
he
said
poetry
has
always
been
a
part
of
education
one
can
not
be
a
good
poet
unless

legislators
and
founders
of
cities
were
the
first
to
employ
fables
to
admonish
and
to
terrify
then
this
duty
which
must
be
performed
for
women
and
children
and
even
for
adults
passed
to
the

and
dominate

with

a
hemistich
recorded
by
plutarch
who
describes
minutely
in
one
of
his
lesser
works
how
the
poets
should
be
read
to
youths
for
him
too
poetry
is
a
preparation
for
philosophy
it
is
a
disguised
philosophy
and
therefore
delights
us
in
the
same
way
as
do
fish
and
meat
at
feasts
so
prepared
as
not
to
seem
to
be
fish
and
meat
it
is
philosophy
softened
with
fables
like
the
vine
that
grows
close
to
the
mandragora
and
produces
a
wine
that
is
the
giver
of
sweet
slumbers
it
is
not
possible
to
pass
from

darkness
to
sunlight
one
should
first
accustom
the
eyes
to
moderate
light
philosophers
in
order
to
exhort
and
instruct
take
their
examples
from
true
things
poets
aim
at
a
like
result
when
they
create
fictions
and
fables
lucretius
in
roman
literature
gives
us
the
comparison
of
the
boys
for
whom
the
doctors
or
as
pocula
circum

in
order
to
administer
the
bitter
wormwood
horace
in
certain
verses
of
the
epistle
to
the
pisones
which
have
become
proverbial
perhaps
his
source
for
them
was
the
greek
of
neoptolemus
of
paros
offers
both
views
that
of
art
as
courtesan
and
of
art
as
pedagogue
in
his
prodesse
volunt
aut
deledare
poetae
omne
tulit
punctum
qui
miscuit
utile
thus
looked
at
the
office
of
the
poet
was
confounded
with
that
of
the
orator
for
he
too
was
a
practical
man
aiming
at
practical
effects
hence
there
arose
discussions
as
to
whether
virgil
was
to
be
considered
as
a
poet
or
as
an
orator
poeta
an
orator
to
both
was
assigned
the
triple
end
of
movere
in
any
case
this
tripartition
was
very
empirical
for
we
clearly
perceive
that
the
is
here
a
the
a
simple
part
of
the
to
move
in
the
direction
of
the
good
and
therefore
among
other
goods
towards
that
of
instruction
in
like
manner
it
was
said
of
the
orator
and
poet
recording
the
meretricious
basis
of
their
task
and
with
a
metaphor
significant
in
its
that
they
were
bound
to
avail
themselves
of
the
of
form
sidenote
æsthetic
in
the
mystical
view
which
considers
art
as
a
special
mode
of
of
entering
into
relation
with
the
absolute
with
the
summum
bonum
with
the
ultimate
root
of
things
appeared
only
in
late
antiquity
almost
at
the
entrance
to
the
middle
ages
its
representative
is
the
founder
of
the
school
plotinus
it
is
strange
that
plato
should
be
usually
selected
as
the
founder
and
head
of
this
æsthetic
tendency
and
that
for
this
very
reason
to
him
should
be
attributed
the
honour
of
being
the
father
of
æsthetic
but
how
could
he
who
had
expounded
with
such
great
limpidity
and
clearness
the
reasons
for
which
he
was
not
able
to
accord
to
art
a
high
place
among
the
activities
of
the
spirit
be
credited
with
having
accorded
to
it
one
of
the
highest
places
equal
if
not
superior
to
philosophy
itself
this
misunderstanding
has
evidently
arisen
out
of
the
enthusiastic
effusions
about
the
beautiful
that
we
read
in
the
the
the
the
and
other
platonic
dialogues
it
is
well
to
dissipate
it
by
declaring
that
the
of
which
plato
discourses
has
nothing
to
do
with
art
or
with
sidenote
as
to
the
the
search
for
the
meaning
and
scientific
content
of
the
word
beautiful
could
not
but
early
attract
the
attention
of
the
subtle
and
elegant
greek
dialecticians
indeed
we
find
socrates
engaged
in
discussing
this
question
in
one
of
the
discourses
that
have
been
preserved
for
us
by
xenophon
and
we
find
him
disposed
to
stop
for
the
moment
at
the
conclusion
that
the
beautiful
is
which
is
convenient
and
which
answers
to
the
end
desired
or
at
the
other
conclusion
that
it
is
which
one
plato
too
examines
this
sort
of
problem
and
proposes
various
sorts
of
solutions
or
attempts
at
solutions
of
it
he
sometimes
speaks
of
a
beauty
that
dwells
not
only
in
bodies
but
also
in
laws
in
actions
in
the
sciences
sometimes
he
seems
to
conjoin
and
almost
to
identify
it
with
the
true
the
good
and
the
divine
now
he
returns
to
the
view
of
socrates
and
confuses
it
with
the
useful
now
he
distinguishes
between
a
beautiful
in
itself
καλά
καθ
αυτά
and
a
relatively
beautiful
πρός
τι
καλά
or
he
makes
true
beauty
consist
in
pure
pleasure
ήδονη
καθαρά
free
from
all
shadow
of
pain
or
he
places
it
in
measure
and
proportion
μετριότης
καί
ξνμμετρία
or
talks
of
colours
and
sounds
as
possessing
a
beauty
in
themselves
it
was
impossible
to
find
an
independent
dominion
for
the
beautiful
if
the
artistic
or
mimetic
activity
were
deserted
this
explains
his
wandering
among
so
many
different
conceptions
among
which
it
is
just
possible
to
say
that
the
identification
of
the
beautiful
with
the
good
prevails
nothing
better
describes
this
uncertainty
than
the
dialogue
of
the
which
if
it
be
not
plato
is
platonic
he
here
wishes
to
find
out
not
what
things
are
beautiful
things
but
what
the
beautiful
is
that
is
to
say
what
it
is
that
makes
beautiful
not
only
a
beautiful
virgin
but
also
a
beautiful
mare
a
beautiful
lyre
a
beautiful
pot
with
two
graceful
ears
of
clay
hippias
and
socrates
himself
propose
in
turn
the
most
various
solutions
but
the
latter
ends
by
confuting
them
all
that
which
makes
things
beautiful
is
the
gold
that
is
added
to
them
by
way
of
ornament
no
gold
only
embellishes
where
it
is
πρέπων
for
instance
a
pot
should
have
a
wooden
rather
than
a
golden
handle
that
is
beautiful
which
can
not
seem
ugly
to
any
one
but
it
is
not
a
question
of
the
question
is
to
define
what
the
beautiful
is
whether
it
seems
so
or
not
it
is
the
which
makes
things
seem
to
be
beautiful
but
in
that
case
the
fitting
which
makes
them
not
is
one
thing
and
the
beautiful
another
the
beautiful
is
what
leads
to
the
end
that
is
to
say
the
χρήσιμον
but
if
that
were
so
then
evil
would
also
be
beautiful
because
the
useful
leads
also
to
the
evil
the
beautiful
is
the
that
which
leads
to
the
good
ωφέλιμον
but
in
this
case
the
good
would
not
be
beautiful
nor
the
beautiful
good
for
the
cause
is
not
the
effect
and
the
effect
is
not
the
cause
the
beautiful
is
that
which
delights
the
sight
and
hearing
but
this
fails
to
persuade
for
three
reasons
firstly
because
beautiful
studies
and
laws
are
beautiful
which
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
eye
or
with
the
ear
secondly
because
we
can
not
discover
a
reason
for
limiting
the
beautiful
to
those
senses
while
excluding
the
pleasure
of
eating
and
smelling
and
the
extremely
vivid
pleasures
of
sex
thirdly
because
if
the
foundation
of
the
beautiful
were
it
would
not
be
and
if
it
were
audibility
it
would
not
be
visibility
hence
that
which
constitutes
the
beautiful
can
not
dwell
in
either
of
the
two
qualities
and
the
question
which
has
been
repeated
so
insistently
in
the
course
of
the
dialogue
is
the
beautiful
τί
εστι
το
καλόν
remains
unanswered
later
writers
also
conducted
inquiries
into
the
beautiful
and
we
possess
the
titles
of
several
treatises
upon
the
theme
which
have
been
lost
aristotle
shows
himself
changeable
and
uncertain
upon
the
point
in
the
scanty
references
which
he
makes
to
it
he
at
one
time
confounds
the
beautiful
with
the
good
defining
it
as
that
which
is
both
good
and
pleasing
at
another
he
notes
that
the
good
consists
of
action
εν
πράξει
and
the
beautiful
also
in
things
that
are
immoveable
εν
τοΐς
άκινήτοις
drawing
from
this
the
argument
that
mathematics
should
be
studied
in
order
to
determine
its
characters
order
symmetry
and
limit
sometimes
he
places
it
in
bigness
and
in
order
εν
μεγεθει
καί

at
others
he
was
led
to
look
upon
it
as
something
apparently
indefinable
antiquity
also
established
canons
of
beautiful
things
such
as
that
attributed
to
polycletus
on
the
proportions
of
the
human
body
and
cicero
said
of
the
beauty
of
bodies
that
they
were
apta
figura

cum
coloris
quadam
all
these
affirmations
even
when
they
are
not
mere
empirical
observations
or
verbal
glosses
and
substitutions
meet
with
unsurmountable
obstacles
sidenote
between
the
theory
of
art
and
the
theory
of
the
in
any
case
not
only
is
the
conception
of
the
beautiful
taken
as
a
whole
identified
with
art
in
none
of
them
but
sometimes
art
and
beauty
mimesis
and

or
displeasing

of

clearly
distinguished
aristotle
notes
in
his
that
it
pleases
us
to
see
the
most
faithful
images
of
things
that
are
repugnant
to
us
in
reality
such
for
instance
as
the
most
contemptible
forms
of
animals
or
corpses

demonstrates
at
length
that
works

please
us
not
as
beautiful
but
as
ούχ

he
affirms
that
if
the
artist
beautified
things
that
are
ugly
in

he
would
be
offending
against
fitness
and
resemblance
το

and
he

the
principle
that

is
one

horrible

are
pleasing
such
as
slaying
her
by
timomachus
the
by
theon
and
the
madness
of
by
parrhasius
and
if
the
grunting
of
a
pig
the
grating
of
a
machine
the
noise
of
the
winds
and
the
tumult
of
the
sea
are
unpleasing
they
pleased
on
the
contrary
in
the
case
of
parmenon
who
imitated
the
pig
perfectly
and
in
theodorus
who
was
not
less
expert
in
rendering
the
grating
of
machines
if
the
ancients
had
really
wanted
to
place
the
beautiful
and
art
in
relation
a
secondary
and
partial
connexion
of
the
two
conceptions
was
to
hand
in
the
shape
of
the
category
of
the
as
distinguished
from
the
beautiful
but
where
the
word
or
is
applied
to
artistic
productions
in
the
writings
of
literary
critics
it
does
not
seem
to
be
more
than
a
linguistic
usage
as
we
find
for
instance
in
the
case
of
imitation
or
also
in
the
terminology
of
the
rhetoricians
who
sometimes
called
elegance
and
adornment
of
discourse
of
elocution
το
τής
φράσεως
κάλλος
sidenote
of
the
two
by
it
is
only
with
plotinus
that
the
two
divided
territories
are
united
and
beautiful
and
art
are
fused
into
a
single
concept
not
by
means
of
a
beneficial
absorption
of
the
platonic
conception
of
beauty
into
the
conception
of
art
but
by
absorption
of
the
clear
into
the
confused
of
in
the
and
thus
we
reach
an
altogether
new
view
the
beautiful
and
art
are
now
both
alike
melted
into
a
mystical
passion
and
elevation
of
the
spirit
beauty
observes
plotinus
resides
chiefly
in
things
visible
but
it
is
also
to
be
found
in
things
audible
such
as
verbal
and
musical
compositions
and
it
is
not
lacking
in
things
supersensible
such
as
works
offices
actions
habits
sciences
and
virtues
what
is
it
that
makes
beautiful
sensible
and
supersensible
things
alike
not
he
answers
the
symmetry
of
their
parts
among
themselves
and
with
the
whole
συμμετρία
των
μερών
προς
αλληλα
και
προς
το
ολον
and
their
colour
ενχροια
according
to
one
of
the
definitions
most
in
vogue
which
we
have
quoted
above
in
the
words
of
cicero
because
there
are
proportions
in
things
ugly
and
there
are
things
that
are
simply
beautiful
without
any
relation
of
proportion
beauty
then
is
one
thing
and
symmetry
another
the
beautiful
is
what
we
welcome
as
akin
to
our
own
nature
the
ugly
is
what
repels
us
as
our
opposite
and
the
affinity
of
beautiful
things
with
our
souls
that
perceive
them
has
its
origin
in
the
idea
which
produces
both
that
is
beautiful
which
is
the
ugly
is
what
is
that
is
to
say
something
which
is
capable
of
receiving
form
but
does
not
receive
it
or
is
not
entirely
dominated
by
it
a
beautiful
body
is
such
because
of
its
communion
κοινωνία
with
the
divine
beauty
is
the
divine
the
idea
shining
through
and
matter
is
beautiful
not
in
itself
but
only
when
it
is
illuminated
by
the
idea
light
and
fire
which
are
nearest
to
this
state
shed
beauty
upon
visible
things
as
the
most
spiritual
among
bodies
but
the
soul
must
purify
itself
in
order
to
perceive
the
beautiful
and
make
the
power
of
the
idea
that
lies
in
it
efficacious
moderation
strength
prudence
and
every
other
virtue
what
else
are
they
according
to
the
oracle
but
thus
there
opens
another
eye
in
the
soul
beside
that
of
sensible
beauty
which
permits
it
to
contemplate
divine
beauty
coincident
with
the
good
which
is
the
supreme
condition
of
beatitude
art
enters
into
such
contemplation
because
beauty
in
things
made
by
man
comes
from
the
mind
compare
two
blocks
of
stone
the
one
placed
beside
the
other
one
rough
and
crude
the
other
reduced
to
the
statue
of
a
god
or
of
a
man
for
example
of
a
grace
or
of
a
muse
or
of
a
human
being
of
such
a
shape
as
art
has
collected
from
many
particular
beauties
the
beauty
of
a
block
of
this
shape
does
not
consist
in
its
being
of
stone
but
in
the
form
that
art
has
been
able
to
give
to
it
παρά
του
ειδους
o
ενηκεν
η
τέχνη
and
when
the
form
is
fully
impressed
upon
it
the
thing
of
art
is
more
beautiful
than
any
other
natural
thing
hence
he
who
despised
the
arts
plato
because
they
imitated
nature
was
wrong
whereas
the
truth
is
in
the
first
place
that
nature
itself
imitates
the
idea
and
then
that
the
arts
do
not
simply
limit
themselves
to
imitating
what
the
eyes
see
but
go
back
to
those
reasons
or
ideas
from
which
nature
itself
is
derived

therefore
does
not
belong
to
nature
but

it
is

phidias

not
represent

because
he
had
seen
him
but
such
as
he
would
appear
if
he
wished
to
reveal
himself
to
mortal
eyes

beauty
of
natural
things
is
the
archetype
existing
in
the
soul
the
sole
source
of

beauty

this
affirmation
of
plotinus
and
of
is
the
first
true
and
proper
affirmation
of
mystical
æsthetic
destined
to
such
high
fortunes
in
modern
times
especially
in
the
first
half
of
the
nineteenth
century
but
the
attempts
at
a

but

go
back
to
aristotle
and
are
altogether
independent
of
his
few
and
feeble
speculations
as
to
the
beautiful
aristotle
by
no
means
agreed
with
the
platonic
condemnation
he
felt
as
indeed
plato
himself
had
suspected
that
such
a
result
could
not
be
altogether
true
and
that
some
aspect
of
the
problem
must
have
been
neglected
when
in
his
turn
he
attempted
to
find
a
solution
he
found
himself
in
more
advantageous
conditions
than
his
great
predecessor
since
he
had
already
overcome
the
obstacle
that
arose
from
the
platonic
doctrine
of
ideas
a
hypostasis
of
concepts
and
abstractions
the
ideas
were
for
him
simply
concepts
and
reality
presented
itself
in
a
far
more
lively
manner
not
as
a
diminution
of
ideas
but
as
a
synthesis
of
matter
and
form
it
was
thus
much
more
easy
for
him
to
recognize
the
rationality
of
mimesis
in
his
general
philosophical
doctrine
and
to
assign
to
it
its
right
place
and
indeed
it
seems
generally
clear
to
aristotle
that
mimesis
being
proper
to
man
by
nature
is
contemplation
or
theoretic
activity
although
he
sometimes
seems
to
forget
this
as
when
he
confuses
imitation
with
the
case
of
boys
who
acquire
their
first
knowledge
by
following
an
example
and
although
his
system
which
admits
practical
sciences
and
poietic
activities
distinguished
from
the
practical
as
leaving
a
material
object
behind
them
disturbed
the
firm
and
constant
consideration
of
artistic
mimesis
and
poetry
as
a
theoretical
activity
but
if
it
is
a
theoretical
activity
by
what
characteristic
is
poetry
distinguished
both
from
knowledge
and
from
knowledge
this
is
the
way
aristotle
states
the
problem
concerning
the
nature
of
art
and
this
is
the
true
and
only
way
of
stating
it
even
we
moderns
ask
ourselves
in
what
way
art
is
distinguished
from
history
and
from
science
and
what
this
artistic
form
can
be
which
has
the
ideality
of
science
and
the
concreteness
and
individuality
of
history
poetry
answers
aristotle
differs
from
history
because
while
the
latter
draws
things
that
have
happened
τα
γενόμενα
poetry
draws
things
that
may
possibly
happen
οια
αν
γένοιτο
and
differs
from
science
because
although
it
regards
the
universal
and
not
the
particular
τα
καθ
εκαστον
like
history
it
does
not
regard
it
in
the
same
way
as
science
but
in
a
certain
measure
which
the
philosopher
indicates
by
the
word
μαλλον
τα
καθόλου
the
point
then
is
to
establish
the
precise
meaning
of
the
the
and
the
but
no
sooner
does
aristotle
attempt
to
determine
the
meaning
of
these
words
than
he
falls
into
contradictions
and
fallacies
that
of
poetry
which
is
the
seems
to
identify
itself
for
him
with
the
probable
or
the
necessary
τα
το
είκος
η
το
and
the
particular
of
history
is
not
explained
at
all
except
by
giving
instances
that
which
alcibiades
did
and
what
happened
to
him
aristotle
in
fact
after
having
made
so
good
a
beginning
in
the
discovery
of
the
purely
imaginative
proper
to
poetry
remains
perplexed
and
uncertain
thus
he
sometimes
makes
the
truth
of
imitation
consist
in
a
certain
learning
and
syllogizing
that
takes
place
when
we
look
at
imitations
by
which
we
recognize
that
this
is
that
that
a
copy
answers
to
the
original
or
worse
he
loses
the
grains
of
truth
that
he
has
found
and
forgets
that
poetry
has
for
its
content
the
possible
admitting
not
only
that
it
may
also
depict
the
το
αδύνατον
and
even
the
το
άτοπον
seeing
that
both
are
and
that
they
do
not
injure
the
end
of
art
but
even
that
we
must
prefer
impossible
probabilities
to
incredible
possibilities
art
since
it
has
to
do
even
with
the
impossible
and
absurd
will
not
therefore
have
in
it
anything
of
the
rational
but
in
accordance
with
the
platonic
theory
it
will
be
an
imitation
of
the
appearance
in
which
empty
sense
indulges
itself
that
is
to
say
a
thing
of
pleasure
aristotle
does
not
attain
to
this
result
because
he
does
not
attain
to
any
clear
and
precise
result
in
this
part
of
the
subject
but
it
is
one
of
the
results
that
can
be
deduced
from
what
he
has
said
or
that
at
any
rate
he
is
not
able
to
exclude
this
means
that
he
did
not
fulfil
his
tacitly
assumed
task
and
that
although
he
the
problem
with
marvellous
acuteness
after
plato
he
failed
truly
to
rid
himself
of
the
platonic
definition
by
substituting
a
one
of
his
own
sidenote
concepts
of
imitation
and
of
imagination
after
a
ristotle
but
the
field
of
investigation
toward
which
aristotle
had
turned
was
generally
neglected
in
antiquity
the
very
of
aristotle
does
not
seem
to
have
been
widely
known
or
influential
ancient
psychology
knew
fancy
or
imagination
as
a
faculty
midway
between
sense
and
intellect
but
always
as
conservative
and
reproductive
of
sensuous
impressions
or
conveying
conceptions
to
the
senses
never
properly
as
a
productive
autonomous
activity
that
faculty
was
rarely
and
with
little
result
placed
in
relation
with
the
problem
of
art
several
historians
of
æsthetic
attach
singular
importance
to
certain
passages
in
the
of
apollonius
of
by
the
elder
philostratus
in
which
they
believe
that
they
discover
a
correction
of
the
theory
of
and
the
first
affirmation
in
history
of
the
conception
of
phidias
and
praxiteles
says
the
extract
in
question
did
not
need
to
go
to
heaven
to
see
the
gods
in
order
to
be
able
to
depict
them
in
their
works
as
would
have
been
necessary
according
to
the
theory
of
imitation
imagination
without
any
need
of
models
made
them
able
to
do
what
they
did
imagination
which
is
a
wiser
agent
than
simple
imitation
φαντασία
σοφωτόρα
μιμήσεως
δημιουργός
and
gives
form
like
the
other
not
only
to
what
has
been
seen
but
also
to
what
has
never
been
seen
imagining
it
on
the
basis
of
existing
things
and
in
that
way
creating
jupiters
and
minervas
however
the
imagination
of
which
philostratus
speaks
here
is
not
something
different
from
the
aristotelian
mimesis
which
as
has
been
noted
was
concerned
not
only
with
real
things
but
also
and
chiefly
with
possible
things
and
had
not
socrates
observed
in
the
dialogue
with
the
painter
parrhasius
preserved
for
us
by
xenophon
that
painters
work
by
collecting
what
they
need
to
form
their
figures
from
several
bodies
εκ
πολλων
συνάγοντες
τα
εξ
εκάστου
καλλιστα
and
was
not
the
anecdote
of
zeuxis
who
was
supposed
to
have
taken
the
best
of
five
crotonian
maidens
in
order
to
paint
his
helen
and
other
anecdotes
of
a
like
sort
sufficiently
widespread
in
antiquity
and
had
not
cicero
eloquently
explained
some
years
before
philostratus
how
phidias
when
he
was
carving
jupiter
did
not
copy
anything
real
but
kept
his
looks
fixed
upon
pulcritudinis
eximia
quaedam
which
he
had
in
his
soul
and
which
directed
his
art
and
his
hand
nor
can
it
be
said
that
philostratus
opened
the
way
to
plotinus
for
whom
the
superior
or
intellectual
imagination
νοητή
or
eye
of
supersensible
beauty
when
it
is
not
a
new
designation
for
beautiful
imitation
is
mystical
intuition
the
vagueness
of
the
concept
of
mimesis
reached
its
apex
in
those
writers
who
gave
it
as
a
general
title
to
any
sort
of
work
that
had
nature
for
its
object
employing
the
aristotelian
phrase
to
affirm
that
ars
naturae
imitatio
est
or
saying
like
the
painter
eupompus
when
he
blamed
his
servile
imitators
that
est
imitanda
non
and
those
who
wished
to
escape
this
vagueness
did
not
know
how
to
do
so
save
by
conceiving
the
activity
of
imitation
as
the
practical
producer
of
duplicates
of
natural
objects
a
prejudice
bora
in
the
bosom
of
the
pictorial
and
plastic
arts
against
which
philostratus
perhaps
intended
to
argue
in
common
with
the
other
advocates
of
imagination
sidenote
on
the
speculations
upon
language
had
a
close
connexion
with
those
upon
the
nature
of
art
begun
by
the
sophists
for
whom
it
became
a
matter
for
wonder
that
sounds
could
signify
colours
or
things
inaudible
that
is
to
say
presented
itself
as
a
it
was
then
discussed
whether
language
was
by
nature
φύσει
or
by
convention
νόμω
by
nature
was
sometimes
understood
mental
necessity
and
by
convention
what
we
should
call
a
merely
natural
fact
psychological
mechanism
or
sensationalism
in
that
sense
of
the
terms
language
would
have
been
better
called
φύσει
than
νόμω
but
at
other
times
the
distinction
led
to
the
question
whether
language
answers
to
objective
or
logical
truth
and
to
the
real
relations
between
things
όρθότης
των
ονομάτων
and
in
this
case
those
would
seem
to
be
nearer
the
truth
who
proclaimed
it
to
be
conventional
or
arbitrary
in
respect
to
logical
truth
νόμω
or
θέσει
and
not
φύσει
two
different
questions
were
consequently
being
treated
together
and
both
were
confusedly
and
equivocally
discussed
they
find
their
monument
in
the
obscure
of
plato
which
seems
to
fluctuate
between
different
solutions
nor
did
the
later
affirmation
that
the
word
is
a
sign
σημείον
of
the
thought
solve
anything
for
it
still
remained
to
be
shown
in
what
way
the
sign
was
to
be
understood
whether
φύσει
or
νόμω
aristotle
who
looked
upon
words
as
imitations
μιμηματα
in
the
same
way
as
poetry
made
an
observation
of
importance
in
addition
to
the
propositions
which
express
the
logically
true
or
false
there
are
others
which
do
not
express
either
the
logically
true
or
false
as
for
example
the
expressions
of
aspirations
and
of
desires
εύχή
which
therefore
belong
not
to
logical
exposition
but
to
poetical
and
rhetorical
exposition
and
in
another
place
we
find
him
affirming
in
opposition
to
bryson
who
had
said
that
a
base
thing
remained
such
with
whatever
word
it
were
designated
that
base
things
can
be
expressed
both
with
words
that
place
them
beneath
the
eye
in
all
their
crudity
and
with
other
words
which
surround
them
with
a
veil
all
this
might
have
led
to
the
separation
of
the
linguistic
faculty
from
the
properly
logical
and
to
its
consideration
in
union
with
the
poetical
and
artistic
faculty
but
here
too
the
attempt
stopped
the
aristotelian
logic
assumed
a
verbal
and
formalistic
character
which
became
more
and
more
accentuated
as
time
went
on
and
formed
an
obstacle
to
the
distinction
between
the
two
theoretical
forms
nevertheless
epicurus
asserted
that
the
diversity
of
names
designating
the
same
thing
with
various
peoples
was
due
not
to
convention
and
caprice
but
to
the
fact
that
the
impressions
produced
by
things
were
different
in
each
one
of
them
and
the
stoics
although
they
connected
language
with
thought
διάνοια
and
not
with
imagination
seem
to
have
had
a
suspicion
of
the
nature
of
language
for
they
interposed
between
thought
and
sound
a
which
was
indicated
in
greek
by
the
word
λεκτόν
and
by
the
words
or
in
latin
but
we
are
not
sure
what
they
really
meant
and
whether
that
vague
concept
were
intended
by
them
to
distinguish
the
linguistic
representation
from
the
abstract
concept
which
would
bring
them
into
touch
with
the
modern
view
or
the
meaning
of
sound
in
general
we
can
not
collect
any
other
germ
of
truth
from
the
ancient
writers

if
it
were
wished
to

of

æsthetic

in

among

of
the

at

entrance
to
the

at
their
conclusion
in

unpleasing
to
me
and
later
in
the
reactionary
savonarola
but
the
narcotic
theory
of
pedagogic
or
moralistic
art
prevailed
over
every
other
it
had
contributed
to
send
to
sleep
the
æsthetic
doubts
and
inquiries
of
the
ancients
and
was
well
suited
to
a
period
of
relative
decadence
of
culture
this
was
all
the
more
the
case
seeing
that
it
accorded
well
with
the
moral
and
religious
ideas
of
the
middle
ages
and
afforded
a
justification
not
only
for
the
new
art
of
christian
inspiration
but
also
for
the
surviving
works
of
classical
and
pagan
art
sidenote
pedagogic

in

the
allegorical

again
a
means
of

for
these
last
the

of
fulgentius
sixth
century
is
a
curious
monument
to
this
fact
this
work
made
virgil
compatible
with
the
middle
ages
and
opened
his
way
to
that
great
reputation
which
he
was
destined
to
attain
as
the
gentle
sage
who
knew
all
things
even
john
of
salisbury
says
of
the
roman
poet
that
imagine
fabularum
totius
philosophiae
exprimit
the
process
of
interpretation
became
fixed
in
the
doctrine
of
the
meanings
literal
allegorical
moral
and
anagogic
which
dante
afterwards
transferred
to
vernacular
poetry
it
would
be
easy
to
accumulate
quotations
from
mediæval
writers
repeating
in
all
keys
the
theory
that
art
inculcates
the
truths
of
morality
and
of
faith
and
constrains
hearts
to
christian
piety
beginning
with
those
verses
of
theodulf
quorum
that
is
to
say
in
the
utterances
of
the
poets
sint
frivola
multa
plurima
sub
falso
tegmine

latent
and
so
on
until
we
reach
the
doctrines
and
opinions
of
our
own
great
men
dante
and
boccaccio
for
dante
poetry
aliud
est
quam
fictio
rhethorica
in
musicaque
the
poet
should
have
a
reasoning
in
his
verses
under
a
cloak
of
figure
or
of
rhetorical
colour
and
it
would
be
a
shameful
thing
for
him
if
when
asked
he
were
not
able
to
divest
his
words
of
such
a
garment
in
such
a
way
as
to
show
that
they
possessed
a
true
meaning
readers
sometimes
stop
at
the
external
vesture
alone
and
this
indeed
suffices
for
those
who
like
the
vulgar
do
not
succeed
in
penetrating
the
hidden
meaning
poetry
will
say
to
the
vulgar
which
does
not
understand
its
argument
what
a
song
of
dante
says
at
its
conclusion
at
least
behold
how
i
am
if
you
are
not
able
to
obtain
instruction
from
me
at
least
enjoy
me
as
a
pleasing
thing
many
indeed
their
beauty
more
than
their
goodness
will
delight
in
poems
unless
they
are
assisted
by
commentaries
in
the
nature
of
the
a
light
which
will
allow
every
shade
of
meaning
to
reach
them
poetry
was
the
gay
science
as
the
spanish
poet
the
marquis
of
santillana
wrote
cosas
utiles
cubiertas
ó
veladas
con
muy
fermosa
cobertura
compuestas
distinguidas

scandidas
por
cierto
cuento

it
would
not
then
be
correct
to
say
that
the
middle
ages
simply
identified
art
with
theology
and
with
philosophy
indeed
it
sharply
distinguished
the
one
from
the
other
defining
art
and
poetry
like
dante
with
the
words
figure
and
rhetorical
colour
cloak
beauty
or
like
santillana
with
those
of
or
this
pleasing
falsity
was
justified
from
the
practical
point
of
view
very
much
in
the
same
way
as
sexual
union
and
love
were
justified
and
sanctified
in
matrimony
this
did
not
exclude
indeed
it
implied
that
the
perfect
state
was
certainly
celibacy
that
is
to
say
pure
science
free
from
admixture
of
art
sidenote
of
an
æsthetic
in
scholastic
the
only
tendency
that
had
no
true
and
proper
representatives
was
the
sound
scientific
tendency
the
of
aristotle
itself
was
hardly
known
or
rather
it
was
from
the
latin
translation
that
a
german
of
the
name
of
hermann
made
not
earlier
than
of
the
paraphrase
or
commentary
of
averroes
perhaps
the
best
of
the
mediæval
investigations
into
language
is
that
supplied
by
dante
vulgari
eloquentia
where
the

is
however
still
looked
upon

would
however
have
found
an
appropriate
occasion
and
a
point
of
departure
in
the
secular
debate
between
nominalism
and
realism
which
could
not
avoid
touching
to
some
extent
the
relations
between
the

and
the

and

the
addition
is
due
perhaps
to
the
editors
abelard

defined

as

as
a
faculty
that
preserved

the

is
intuitive
in
the
preceding

and
we
have
finally
the

of

find
the
same
importance
attached
to

with
the
progressive
denominations
of
the
different
sorts
of

we
shall
see
this
terminology
reappear
big
with
consequences
at
the
very
commencement
of
modern
æsthetic
sidenote
philography
and
philosophical
and
empirical
inquiries
concerning
the
it
may
be
said
that
the
literary
and
artistic
doctrines
and
opinions
of
the
middle
ages
have
with
few
exceptions
a
value
rather
for
the
history
of
culture
than
for
the
general
history
of
science
the
like
observation
holds
good
of
the
renaissance
for
here
too
the
circle
of
the
ideas
of
antiquity
was
not
overstepped

increases
original
sources
are

the
ancient

and
henceforth

and
the

the

increased
the

has
become
bigger
but
truly
original
ideas
do
not
yet
show
themselves
in
the
domain
of
æsthetic

the
mystical

is
refreshed
and
strengthened
by
the
renewed

of

of

of

it
is
divided

of
the
nature
and
essence
of
the
universality

of
the
origin
of
love
and
it
is
demonstrated
that
every
beautiful
thing
is
good
but
not
every
good
thing
is
beautiful
that
beauty
is
a
grace
which
dilates
the
soul
and
moves
it
to
love
and
that
knowledge
of
lesser
beauties
leads
to
that
of
higher
spiritual
beauties
the
author
gave
the
name
of
philography
to
these
and
similar
affirmations
and
effusions
of
which
the
book
is
composed
equicola
work
is
also
interesting
because
it
contains
historical
accounts
of
those
who
wrote
upon
the
subject
before
he
did
so
himself
the
same
intuition
was
versified
and
sighed
forth
by
the
petrarchists
in
their
sonnets
and
ballads
while
others
rebellious
and
mocking
derided
it
in
comedies
verses
in
and
parodies
of
all
sorts
some
mathematicians
reincarnations
of
pythagoras
set
to
work
to
determine
beauty
by
exact
relations
for
instance
friend
luca
paciolo
in
the
divina
in
which
he
laid
down
the
pretended
æsthetic
law
of
the
golden
section
and
side
by
side
with
these
new
pythagoreans
were
those
who
revived
the
canon
of
polycletus
as
to
the
beauty
of
the
human
body
especially
of
the
female
body
such
as
firenzuola
franco
luigini
and
dolce
michæl
angelo
fixed
an
empirical
canon
for
painting
in
general
when
he
stated
that
the
means
of
giving
movement
and
grace
to
figures
consisted
in
the
observance
of
a
certain
arithmetical
relation
others
such
as
fulvio
pellegrino
morato
investigated
the
symbolism
or
meaning
of
colours
the
platonists
generally
placed
beauty
in
the
soul
the
aristotelians
rather
in
the
physical
qualities
the
averroist
agostino
nifo
amid
much
chatter
and
many
inconclusive
remarks
demonstrated
the
existence
of
the
beautiful
in
nature
by
describing
the
supremely
beautiful
body
of

of

of

the
uncertainties
of
the
of

not
without
making
a
free
use
of
the
speculations
of
plotinus
a
chapter
of
the
of
campanella
possesses
greater
importance
where
he
describes
the
good
as
and
the
ugly
as
mali
understanding
by
good
the
three
prime
forces
of
power
wisdom
and
love
although
campanella
was
still
tied
to
the
platonic
idea
of
the
beautiful
the
conception
of
a
sign
or
symbol
here
introduced
by
him
represents
progress
by
this
means
he
succeeded
in
perceiving
that
material
things
or
external
facts
are
neither
beautiful
nor
ugly
in
themselves
mandricard
called
the
wounds
in
the
bodies
of
his
friends
the
moors
beautiful
for
they
were
large
and
gave
evidence
of
the
great
strength
of
roland
who
dealt

saint
augustine
called
the
gashes
and
the
dislocations
in
the
body
of
saint
vincent
beautiful
because
they
were
evidence
of
his
endurance
but
they
were
on
the
other
hand
ugly
in
so
far
as
they
were
signs
of
the
cruelty
of
the
tyrant
dacianus
and
of
his
executioners
it
is
beautiful
to
die
fighting
said
virgil
for
it
is
the
sign
of
a
strong
soul
the
pet
dog
of
his
mistress
will
seem
beautiful
to
the
lover
and
doctors
call
even
urine
and
fæces
beautiful
when
they
indicate
health
everything
is
both
beautiful
and
ugly
nihil
est
quod
non
sit
pulcrum
simul
et
in
such
observations
as
these
we
have
not
a
mere
state
of
mystical
exaltation
but
to
some
extent
a
movement
in
the
direction
of
analysis
sidenote
pedagogic
theory
of
art
and
the
poetics
of
nothing
better
serves
to
demonstrate
that
the
renaissance
did
not
pass
beyond
the
confines
of
ancient
æsthetic
thought
than
the
fact
that
notwithstanding
the
renewed
acquaintance
with
the
thought
of
aristotle
the
pedagogic
theory
of
art
not
only
persisted
and
triumphed
but
was
transplanted
bodily
into
the
text
of
aristotle
where
its
interpreters
read
it
with
a
certainty
that
we
have
to
make
efforts
to
achieve
certainly
a
robortelli
or
a
castelvetro
stopped
short
at
the
simple
purely
hedonistic
solution
giving
simple
pleasure
as
the
end
of
art
poetry
says
castelvetro
was
discovered
solely
for
the
purpose
of
delighting
and
of
recreating
the
souls
of
the
rude
multitude
and
of
the
common
people
and
here
and
there
some
were
able
to
free
themselves
from
both
the
pleasure
theory
and
that
of
the
didactic
end
but
the
majority
such
as
segni
maggi
vettori
were
for
the
scaliger
declared
that
mimesis
or
imitation
was
medius
ad
illum
ultimum
qui
est
docendi
cum
delectatione
and
believing
himself
to
be
altogether
in
agreement
with
aristotle
as
to
this
he
continued
affectus
poeta
per
actiones
ut
bonos
amplectamur
atque
imitemur
ad
agendum
malos
aspernemur
ad
piccolomini
observed
that
it
must
not
be
thought
that
so
many
excellent
poets
and
artists
ancient
and
modern
would
have
devoted
such
care
and
diligence
to
this
most
noble
study
had
they
not
known
and
believed
that
in
so
doing
they
were
aiding
human
life
and
if
they
had
not
thought
that
we
were
to
be
instructed
directed
and
well
established
by
it
the
truth
preserved
in
soft
verses
which
attracts
and
persuades
the
most
reluctant
tasso
with
the
comparison
from
lucretius
attached
is
the
conception
that
even
campanella
repeats
poetry
is
for
him
quaedam
figurata
quasi
magica
quae

suadendum
bonum
et
dissuadendum
malum

et

non
possunt
aut
thus
returned
the
comparison
of
poetry
with
oratory
according
to
segni
they
only
differ
because
the
first
occupies
a
more
lofty
situation
for
since
imitation
representing
itself
in
act
by
means
of
poetry
in
mighty
chosen
words
in
metaphors
images
and
indeed
the
whole
of
figured
speech
which
is
to
be
found
more
in
poetry
than
in
the
art
of
oratory
the
metrical
qualities
that
are
also
required
in
verse
the
subjects
of
which
it
treats
which
have
something
of
the
great
and
delightful
make
it
appear
most
beautiful
and
worthy
of
being
held
all
the
greater
marvel
three
most
noble
arts

tassoni
in
and
he
repeated
common
opinion
history
poetics
and
oratory

under
the
heading
of

and
depend
upon
it
the
first

these

the
instruction
of

and
gentlemen
the

the
people
the
third
of
those
who
give
counsel
in
public
trials
or
defend
private
ones
that
come
up
for
judgment
according
to
these
views
the
tragical
catharsis
was
regarded
as
designed
in
general
to
demonstrate
the
instability
of
fortune
or
to
terrify
by
example
or
to
proclaim
the
triumph
of
justice
or
to
render
the
spectators
insensible
to
the
strokes
of

to
their
familiarity
with

pedagogic
theory
thus
renewed
and
sustained
by
the
authority
of
the
ancients
was
popularized
in
france
spain
england
and
germany
together
with
all
the
italian
poetic
doctrines
of
the
renaissance
the
french
writers
of
the
period
of
louis
xiv
are
altogether
penetrated
with
it
science
agréable
qui
mêle
la

is
what
la
ménardière
calls
poetry
in
the
same
way
as
le
bossu
for
whom
premier
but
du
poète
est
as
homer
taught
when
he
wrote
two
interesting
didactic
manuals
relating
to
military
and
political
events
the
and
the
sidenote
poetics
of
the
renaissance
this
pedagogic
theory
has
therefore
been
reasonably
described
by
all
the
modern
critics
in
concert
as
if
by
antonomasia
as
the
of
the
it
must
however
always
be
understood
that
it
did
not
appear
for
the
first
time
in
the
fifteenth
or
sixteenth
century
but
that
it
was
prevalent
and
generally
accepted
at
that
time
it
may
even
be
remarked
as
has
already
been
acutely
done
that
the
renaissance
naturally
did
not
distinguish
the
didactic
kind
of
poetry
from
the
other
kinds
since
for
it
every
kind
of
poetry
was
didactic
but
the
renaissance
was
not
a
real
renaissance
save
when
and
where
it
continued
the
interrupted
spiritual
work
of
antiquity
and
in
this
sense
it
would
perhaps
be
more
just
to
describe
as
its
poetics
or
rather
as
the
important
element
in
its
poetics
not
the
repetition
of
the
pedagogic
theory
of
antiquity
and
of
the
middle
ages
but
the
resumption
which
also
took
place
of
the
discussions
upon
the
possible
the
probable
εικός
of
aristotle
on
the
reasons
of
plato
condemnation
and
on
the
procedure
of
the
artist
who
creates
by
imagining
sidenote
concerning
the
universal
and
the
probable
in
it
is
in
such
discussions
that
is
to
be
found
the
true
contribution
of
that
epoch
not
to
learning
but
to
the
formation
of
the
science
of
æsthetic
the
ground
was
prepared
and
enriched
through
the
work
of
the
interpreters
and
commentators
of
aristotle
and
of
the
new
writers
on
poetics
especially
the
italians
and
it
was
also
enriched
with
some
seed
that
was
destined
to
sprout
and
to
become
a
vigorous
plant
in
the
future
the
study
of
plato
also
contributed
not
a
little
to
call
attention
to
the
function
of
the
idea
or
of
the
universal
in
poetry
what
meaning
was
to
be
attached
to
the
statement
that
poetry
should
aim
at
the
universal
and
history
at
the
particular
what
was
the
meaning
of
the
proposition
that
poetry
should
proceed
according
to
what
could
that
consist
of
which
raphæl
said
that
he
followed
in
his
painting
sidenote
girolamo
fracastoro
was
among
the
first
to
ask
himself
this
question
seriously
in
the
dialogue
sive
de
he
disdainfully
rejected
the
thesis
that
the
end
of
poetry
is
pleasure
far
be
from
us
he
exclaimed
so
bad
an
opinion
of
the
poets
who
the
ancients
said
were
the
inventors
of
all
the
good
arts
nor
did
the
end
of
instruction
seem
to
him
to
be
acceptable
which
is
the
task
not
of
poetry
but
of
other
faculties
such
as
geography
history
agronomy
philosophy
the
poet
task
is
to
represent
or
to
imitate
and
he
differs
from
the
historian
not
in
the
matter
but
in
the
manner
of
representation
the
others
imitate
the
particular
the
poet
the
universal
the
others
are
like
the
painters
of
portraits
the
poet
produces
things
as
he
contemplates
the
universal
and
most
beautiful
idea
of
them
the
others
say
only
what
they
need
to
say
for
their
purposes
the
poet
that
he
may
say
everything
beautifully
and
fully
but
the
beauty
of
a
poem
must
always
be
understood
as
relative
to
the
class
of
subject
of
which
it
treats
it
is
the
most
beautiful
in
this
class
not
the
supremely
beautiful
one
must
be
careful
to
guard
against
the
equivocal
or
double
meaning
of
this
word
beauty
illius
a
poet
never
utters
what
is
false
or
expresses
what
does
not
exist
for
his
words
inevitably
harmonize
in
appearance
or
signification
either
with
the
opinions
of
men
or
with
the
universal
nor
can
we
accept
the
platonic
axiom
that
the
poet
has
no
knowledge
of
the
things
of
which
he
treats
he
does
know
them
but
in
his
own
poet
manner
sidenote
while
fracastoro
strives
to
elaborate
the
important
passage
in
aristotle
touching
the
universal
of
poetry
and
though
somewhat
vague
in
his
treatment
keeps
fairly
close
to
the
mark
castelvetro
on
the
contrary
judges
the
aristotelian
fragment
with
the
freedom
and
superior
knowledge
of
the
true
critic
he
recognizes
that
the
is
merely
a
notebook
recording
certain
principles
and
methods
of
compiling
the
art
not
the
art
fully
compiled
he
remarks
moreover
not
without
logical
acumen
that
aristotle
having
adopted
the
criterion
of
probability
or
of
that
which
presents
an
appearance
of
historic
truth
should
have
applied
his
theory
in
the
first
case
to
history
not
to
poetry
for
history
being
a
narrative
according
to
truth
of
memorable
human
actions
and
poetry
a
narrative
according
to
probability
of
events
which
might
possibly
occur
the
second
can
not
receive
all
its
radiance
from
the
first
nor
does
it
escape
him
that
aristotle
describes
two
different
things
by
the
one
word
imitation
following
the
example
of
another
which
is
acting
in
exactly
the
same
way
as
another
without
knowing
the
reason
of
such
action
and
the
imitation
demanded
by
poetry
which
does
things
in
a
manner
totally
different
from
that
in
which
they
have
been
done
hitherto
and
proposes
a
new
example
for
imitation
nevertheless
castelvetro
can
not
extricate
himself
from
the
confusion
between
the
imaginary
and
the
historical
for
he
himself
says
the
realm
of
the
former
is
generally
that
of
certainty
but
the
field
of
certainty
is
often
crossed
with
bars
of
uncertainty
just
as
the
field
of
uncertainty
is
often
crossed
with
bars
of
certainty
also
what
can
be
said
of
this
curious
interpretation
of
the
aristotelian
theory
of
pleasure
experienced
in
the
imitation
of
ugly
models
that
such
pleasure
is
based
on
the
fact
that
since
an
imitation
is
always
imperfect
it
is
incapable
of
exciting
the
disgust
and
fear
which
would
arise
from
the
contemplation
of
real
ugliness
and
what
of
his
remark
that
the
characteristics
of
painting
and
poetry
are
so
diverse
as
to
be
in
opposition
one
to
the
other
imitation
of
objects
giving
rise
to
great
pleasure
in
the
former
art
and
as
great
displeasure
in
the
latter
and
so
on
in
numberless
cases
of
bold
but
scarcely
felicitous
subtleties
sidenote
and
in
opposition
to
robortelli
who
asserted
the
identity
of
the
probable
and
the
false
piccolomini
held
that
the
probable
is
inherently
neither
false
nor
true
only
by
accident
becoming
one
or
other
of
the
same
mind
is
the
spaniard
alfonso
lopez
pinciano
who
says
the
scope
of
poetry

á
lo

no
what
may
lie
behind
this
notion
of
probability
is
still
indefinite
and
impenetrable
sidenote
moved
by
a
wish
to
place
poetry
on
a
foundation
other
than
the
probable
francesco
patrizzi
the
composed
his
between
and
in
refutation
of
all
aristotle
main
doctrines
patrizzi
notes
that
the
word
imitation
is
given
many
meanings
by
the
greek
philosopher
who
uses
it
now
to
denote
a
single
word
now
to
describe
a
tragedy
at
times
it
stands
for
a
figure
of
speech
at
others
for
a
fiction
whence
he
draws
the
logical
conclusion
from
which
however
he
shrinks
alarmed
that
all
philosophic
and
other
kinds
of
writing
and
speaking
are
poetry
since
they
are
made
of
words
which
themselves
are
imitations
he
observes
further
that
according
to
aristotle
it
is
impossible
to
distinguish
between
poetry
and
history
since
both
are
imitations
or
to
prove
that
verse
is
not
essential
to
poetry
or
that
history
science
and
art
are
unsuitable
material
for
it
since
aristotle
in
several
passages
says
that
poetry
may
comprise
fable
actual
occurrences
belief
of
others
duty
the
best
necessity
the
possible
the
probable
the
credible
the
incredible
the
suitable
as
well
as
all
things
worldly
after
these
objections
some
sound
others
sophistical
patrizzi
comes
to
the
conclusion
that
there
is
no
truth
in
the
dogma
that
poetry
is
wholly
imitation
and
even
if
it
be
imitation
at
all
it
belongs
not
to
poets
alone
nor
is
it
mere
imitation
of
any
kind
but
something
else
not
mentioned
by
aristotle
nor
pointed
out
by
any
one
else
nor
yet
borne
into
the
mind
of
man
the
discovery
may
possibly
be
made
in
course
of
time
or
some
one
may
hit
upon
the
truth
and
bring
it
to
light
but
up
to
the
present
such
discovery
has
not
been
made
yet
these
confessions
of
ignorance
these
endeavours
though
vain
to
escape
from
the
aristotelian
circle
of
ideas
and
the
great
literary
controversies
of
the
sixteenth
century
concerning
the
concept
of
poetic
truth
and
the
probable
had
their
use
in
that
they
stimulated
interest
by
directing
attention
to
a
mystery
still
unsolved

once
more
begun
to
move
upon
the

differed
somewhat
from

arose
if
we
mistake
not
from
its
convenience
in
rhetoric
as
conceived
by
antiquity
that
is
to

a
suave
and
facile
mode
of
knowledge
as
opposed
to
the
severity

so

clenched

was

repeated
much
more
frequently
than
in

was
hailed
as
presiding
genius
of

vivacities
were
lauded
to
the
skies
was
a
phrase
seized
upon
by
the
french
who
rendered
it
as
or

of
the
most
noteworthy
commentators
on
these
matters
although
opposed
to
the
literary
excesses
of

times
matteo
pellegrini
of

defines
wit
as
that
part
of
the
soul
which
in
a
certain
way
practises
aims
and
seeks
to
find
and
create
the
beautiful
and
the
efficacious

considers
the

the
word

was
equally
widespread
and
fashionable
signifying
the
faculty
of
judgement
brought
to
bear
on
the
beautiful
distinct
to
some
extent
from
intellectual
power
and
sometimes
divided
into
active
and
passive
so
that
it
was
usual
to
speak
of
one
kind
of
taste
as
productive
or
fertile
thus
coinciding
with
wit
and
of
another
as
sterile

meanings
of
the
word
from
the
rough
notes
which
we
possess
as
to
the
history
of

concept

meanings
of
the
word
not
all
of
equal
importance
as
indications
of
the
development
of
ideas
detach
themselves
in
a
somewhat
confused
manner
taste
meaning
pleasure
or
delight
was
an
word
in
italy
and
spain
as
is
shown
in
such
phrases
as
to
have
a
taste
for
to
be
to
one
taste
when
lope
di
vega
and
other
spaniards
speak
continually
of
the
drama
of
their
country
as
seeking
to
please
the
popular
taste
el
darle
they
mean
only
the
pleasure
of
the
populace
in
italy
there
was
a
very
ancient
use
of
the
word
in
the
metaphorical
sense
of
judgement
either
literary
scientific
or
artistic
numberless
examples
of
this
use
occur
in
writers
of
the
sixteenth
century
ariosto
varchi
michæl
angelo
tasso
to
take
but
one
of
these
the
lines
in
where
it
is
said
of
the
emperor
augustus

la
proscrizione
iniqua

perdona
for
having
had
good
taste
in

he
shall
be
forgiven
his
iniquitous
proscriptions
or
the
remark
of
ludovico
dolce
some
person
had
such
exquisite
taste
he
sang
no
verses
save
those
of
catullus
and
calvus
the
word
taste
in
the
sense
of
a
special
faculty
or
attitude
of
mind
appears
to
have
been
used
for
the
first
time
in
spain
in
the
middle
of
the
seventeenth
century
by
gracian
the
moralist
and
political
writer
already
quoted
it
is
evidently
to
him
that
the
italian
author
trevisano
alludes
in
a
preface
to
a
book
by
muratori
when
he
speaks
of
spaniards
above
all
others
cunning
in
metaphor
who
express
themselves
in
that
eloquent
and
laconic
phrase
good
taste
touching
further
on
taste
and
genius
he
quotes
that
ingenious
spaniard
gracian
who
gave
the
word
the
sense
of
practical
wit
enabling
one
to
perceive
the
true
signification
of
things
his
man
of
good
taste
becomes
in
our
language
a
man
of
tact
in
the
affairs
of
life
the
transference
of
the
word
to
the
domain
of
æsthetic
seems
to
have
taken
place
in
france
during
the
last
quarter
of
the

in
of

with

which
deals
not
with

fact
or
historical

but
with
primary
apprehensions
which
assert
neither

following
this
line
of
argument
imagination
takes
the
place
of
that
probable
neither

advocated
by
some
commentators
of
aristotle
a
theory
strongly
criticized
by
pallavicino
here
agreeing
with

however
he
does
not

quite

that

although
he
has
no
belief
in
them
yet
they
please
him
greatly
for
if

desired
to
be

had

be

nothing
but
an
untruth
uttered
in
the
hope
that
it
may
be

how
then
should
an
art
so
tainted
be
allowed
to
flourish
in
the
republics
how
should
it
be
commended
and
used
by
the
very
writers
of
holy
scripture
pictura
poetry
is
like
painting
which
is
a
diligent
imitation
aiming
at
a
close
copy
of
the
features

acts
nay
even
the
hidden
motives
of
the
objects
it
represents
and
it
does
not
pretend
that
fiction
is

the
sole
aim
of
poetic
tales
is
to
adorn
our
understanding
with
imagery
that
is
to
say
with
sumptuous

marvellous
and
splendid
appearances
and
this
is
known
to
diffuse
so
useful
an
influence
on
mankind
that
humanity
insists
on
rewarding
poets
with
praise
more
glorious
than
is
bestowed
on
any
other
men
their
books
are
protected
from
the
ravages
of
time
with
greater
solicitude
than
is
shown
to
scientific

or
productions
of
any
other
art
in
the
end
the
names
of
poets
are
crowned
with
adoring
veneration
see
how
the
world
thirsts
for
beautiful
first
apprehensions
although
these
are
neither
laden
with
science
nor
are
they
vehicles
of
truth
sixty
years
later
these
ideas
although
expressed
by
a
cardinal
seemed
all
too
daring
to
muratori
who
could
not
bring
himself
to
allow
poets
so
much
latitude
or
to
enfranchize
them
from
their
obligations
to
the
probable
nevertheless
muratori
allows
a
large
space
to
imagination
an
inferior
apprehensive
faculty
which
without
caring
whether
things
be
false
or
true
confines
itself
to
apprehending
them
and
represents
the
truth
merely
leaving
the
task
of
cognition
to
the
superior
apprehensive
faculty
or
intellect
even
the
stony
heart
of
gravina
yields
to
the
charm
of
imagination
he
admits
it
occupies
a
considerable
place
in
the
realm
of
poetry
and
suffers
his
own
arid
prose
to
describe
it
as
a
sorceress
but
beneficent
a
delirium
which
cures
madness
earlier
than
either
of
these
ettori
commended
it
to
the
good
rhetorician
who
in
order
that
he
may
awaken
images
must
familiarize
himself
with
whatever
is
subject
to
bodily
feeling
and
encounter
the
genius
of
imagination
which
is
a
sensuous
faculty
to
these
ends
using
species
rather
than
genera
since
the
latter
being
more
universal
than
the
former
are
less
sensible
individuals
rather
than

the
number
of

rather
than
the
number
of
the
less
as
far
back
as
the
spaniard
huarte
had
maintained
that
eloquence
is
the
product
of
imagination
rather
than
of
intellect
or
reason
in

hobbes
inquired
into
the

of

addison
devoted
several
numbers
of
his
to
analysis
of
the
pleasures
of
imagination
somewhat
later
the
importance
of
imagination
was
felt
in
germany
where
it
found
advocates
in
bodmer
breitinger
and
other
writers
of
the
swiss
school
who
owed
much
to
the
influence
of
the
italians
muratori
gravina
calepio
and
the
english
acting
in
their
turn
as
teachers
of
klopstock
and
the
new
german
critical
school
sidenote
it
was
at
this

period
that
opposition
became
clearly
marked
between
those
accustomed

those
used
to

the
frenchman
du
bos
author
of
critiques
sur
la

upholds
the
theory
of
feeling
according
to
him
art
is
simply
a
impressions
que
les
objets
étrangers
font
sur
nous
setting
aside
all
reflective
labour
he
laughs
at
those
philosophers
who
deny
the
force
of
imagination
and
malebranche
eloquent
discourse
founded
on
this
denial
draws
from
du
bos
the
remark
à
notre
imagination
parle
contre
de
he
refuses
to
see
any
intellectual
nucleus
in
the
productions
of
the
arts
saying
that
art
consists
not
in
instruction
but
in
style
nor
is
he
too
respectful
towards
the
probable
he
says
he
finds
himself
unable
to
set
limits
between
it
and
the
marvellous
and
leaves
to
born
poets
the
task
of
thus
miraculously
uniting
opposites
for
du
bos
there
is
no
criterion
of
art
save
feeling
which
he
calls
a
sens
against
which
dispute
is
vain
since
in
such
matters
popular
opinion
invariably
wins
the
day
over
the
dogmatic
pronouncements
of
artists
and
men
of
letters
all
the
ingenious
conceits
of
the
greatest
metaphysicians
though
unimpeachable
in
themselves
will
not
in
the
slightest
degree
diminish
the
lustre
of
poetry
or
despoil
it
of
one
single
attraction
attempts
to
discredit
ariosto
and
tasso
in
the
eyes
of
italians
were
as
vain
as
those
made
against
the
in
france
other
people
arguments
can
never
persuade
us
of
the
contrary
of
what
we
feel
these
notions
were
adopted
by
many
french
writers
for
example

the

in
emphasizing
the
concept
of
emotion
in
their
theories
of
literature
sidenote
to
unite
these
in
the
writings
of
this
period
was
often
identified
with
with
with
and
with
first
apprehensions
or
we
have
already
noted
that
taste
is
sometimes
critical
and
sometimes
productive
this
fusion
identification
and
subordination
of
terms
apparently
distinct
shows
how
they
gravitate
round
one
single
concept
sidenote
and
contradictions
in
their
a
german
critic
one
of
the
very
few
who
have
sought
to
penetrate
the
darkness
surrounding
the
origins
of
modern
æsthetic
considers
the
concept
of
taste
which
we
owe
he
thinks
to
gracian
the
most
important
æsthetic
doctrine
which
remained
for
modern
times
to
discover
but
without
going
so
far
as
to
say
that
taste
is
the
chief
doctrine
of
the
science
and
the
foundation
of
all
the
rest
instead
of
only
a
particular
doctrine
and
without
recapitulating
what
we
have
already
said
of
gracian
relation
to
the
theory
of
taste
it
is
well
to
repeat
that
taste
wit
imagination
feeling
and
so
on
instead
of
new
concepts
scientifically
grasped
were
simply
new
words
corresponding
to
vague
impressions
at
most
they
were
problems
not
concepts
apprehensions
of
ground
still
to
be
conquered
not
yet
annexed
and
brought
into
subjection
it
must
not
be
forgotten
that
the
very
men
who
made
use
of
these
terms
could
scarcely
grope
after
the
ideas
they
suggested
without
falling
back
into
the
old
traditions
the
only
ones
on
which
they
had
an
intellectual
grasp
to
them
the
new
words
were
shades
not
bodies
when
they
tried
to
embrace
them
their
arms
returned
empty
to
their
own
breasts
sidenote
and
certainly
wit
differs
to
a
certain
extent
from
intellect
yet
pellegrini
and
tesauro
with
other
writers
of
treatises
never
fail
to
point
out
that
intellectual
truth
lies
at
the
root
of
wit
trevisano
defines
it
as
an
internal
virtue
of
the
soul
which
invents
methods
for
expressing
and
executing
its
own
concepts
it
is
recognizable
now
in
the
arrangement
of
things
we
invent
now
in
the
clear
expression
of
them
sometimes
in
cunning
reconciliations
of
matters
seemingly
opposed
sometimes
in
tracing
analogies
but
faintly
discernible
to
sum
up
one
must
not
allow
the
actions
of
wit
to
go
unaccompanied
by
those
of
intellect
or
even
by
those
of
practical
morality
more
ingenuously
muratori
says
wit
is
that
virtue
and
active
force
with
which
the
intellect
is
able
to
assemble
unite
and
discover
the
similarities
relations
and
reasons
of
things
in
this
manner
wit
after
having
been
distinguished
from
intellect
eventually
becomes
a
part
or
a
manifestation
of
it
by
a
somewhat
different
path
the
same
conclusion
is
reached
by
alexander
pope
when
he
counsels
that
wit
be
reined
in
like
a
mettlesome
horse
and
observes
for
wit
and
judgement
often
are
at
strife
though
meant
each
other
aid
like
man
and
wife
sidenote
and
intellectual
similar
vicissitudes
befell
the
word
taste
outcome
of
a
metaphor
as
was
noted
by
kant
whose
effect
was
to
stand
in
opposition
to
intellectualistic
principles
as
if
to
say
that
the
judgement
governing
the
choice
of
food
destined
solely
for
the
delectation
of
the
palate
is
of
the
same
nature
as
that
which
decides
opinions
in
matters
of
art
nevertheless
the
very
definition
of
this
concept
contained
a
reference
to
intellect
and
reason
the
implicit
comparison
with
the
palate
was
ultimately
taken
as
signifying
an
anticipation
of
reflexion
as
voltaire
wrote
in
the
following
century

la

through
all
the
definitions
of

another

that
it
may
generally
be
described
as

regulated

it

sidenote
and

the
corrective
of
if
the
attempt
to
define
wit
and
taste
usually
resulted
in
intellectualism
it
was
easy
to
transform
imagination
and
feeling
into
sensationalistic
doctrines
we
have
seen
how
earnestly
pallavicino
insisted
on
the
of
the
fantasies
and
inventions
of
the
imagination
nothing
presents
itself
to
the
admirer
of
the
beautiful
he
writes
to
enable
him
to
verify
his
cognition
and
satisfy
himself
that
the
object
recognized
is
or
is
not
that
for
which
he
takes
it
if
either
by
vision
or
by
strong
apprehension
he
is
led
to
think
it
actually
present
by
an
act
of
judgement
his
taste
for
beauty
as
beauty
does
not
arise
from
such
act
of
judgement
but
from
the
vision
or
lively
apprehension
which
might
remain
in
ourselves
even
when
the
deception
of
belief
was
corrected
just
as
happens
when
we
are
drowsy
and
know
ourselves
to
be
but
half
awake
yet
are
unwilling
to
tear
ourselves
from
sweet
dreams
for
pallavicino
imagination
can
not
err
he
assimilates
it
wholly
to
the
sensations
which
are
incapable
of
truth
or
falsity
and
if
imaginative
knowledge
pleases
it
is
not
because
it
holds
a
special
truth
imaginative
truth
but
because
it
creates
objects
which
though
false
are
pleasing
the
painter
makes
not
likenesses
but
images
which
all
resemblance
apart
are
pleasing
to
the
sight
the
poet
awakens
apprehensions
sumptuous
novel
marvellous
splendid
his
opinion
coincides
if
we
mistake
not
with
sensationalism
the
poet
should
aim
only
at
the
marvellous
he
who
can
not
amaze
his
hearers
is
not
worth
a
straw
he
applauds
the
dictum
of
gabriel
chiabrera
that
pindar
of
savona
that
poetry
should
cause
the
eyebrows
to
arch
themselves
but
in
the
upon
written
later
he
repents
of
his
youthful
achievement
and
appears
willing
to
return
to
the
pedagogic
theory
and
forasmuch
as
i
theorized
concerning
poetry
in
the
basest
manner
treating
it
solely
as
a
minister
of
that
delight
which
the
mind
enjoys
in
the
less
noble
operation
of
imagination
or
apprehension
arising
from
imagination
and
therefore
in
consequence
i
somewhat
relaxed
the
strings
which
bind
it
to
the
probable
i
now
wish
to
demonstrate
that
poetry
has
other
functions
more
exalted
and
fruitful
while
remaining
in
strict
servitude
to
the
probable
which
office
is
to
guide
our
minds
in
the
noble
exercise
of
judgement
thus
it
becomes
the
nurse
of
philosophy
which
it
nourishes
with
sweet
milk
the
jesuit
ettori
while
inculcating
the
use
of
imagination
and
recommending
orators
to
go
to
school
with
the
actors
points
out
that
imagination
should
fulfil
the
simple
office
of
interpreter
between
intellect
and
truth
never
assuming
dominion
otherwise
the
orator
would
be
treating
his
audience
or
readers
not
as
men
to
whom
intellect
is
proper
but
as
beasts
whom
imagination
satisfies
the
conception
of
imagination
as
purely
sensuous
shows
strongly
in
muratori
who
is
so
convinced
that
the
faculty
if
left
to
itself
would
deteriorate
into
a
riot
of
dreams
and
intoxication
that
he
links
it
to
intellect
as
to
an
authoritative
friend
who
shall
influence
the
choice
and
combination
of
images
the
problem
of
the
nature
of
imagination
had
strong
attraction
for
muratori
and
while
traducing
and
vilifying
he
returns
to
it
again
in
his
forza
della
fantasia
describing
it
as
a
material
faculty
essentially
different
from
the
mental
or
spiritual
and
denying
it
the
validity
of
knowledge
although
he
had
observed
that
the
aim
of
poetry
is
distinct
from
that
of
science
in
that
the
latter
seeks
to
know
and
the
former
to
represent
truth
he
persisted
in
counting
poetry
as
an
art
of
delectation
subordinate
to
moral
philosophy
of
whom
she
was
one
of
the
three
servants
or
ministers
very
similarly
gravina
held
that
along
with
novelty
and
delight
in
the
marvellous
poetry
should
endow
the
mind
of
the
vulgar
with
truth
and
universal
cognitions
outside
italy
the
same
movement
was
going
on
bacon
although
he
assigned
poetry
to
imagination
yet
considered
it
as
something
intermediary
between
history
and
science
approximating
epic
to
history
and
the
most
lofty
style
the
parabolic
to
science
parabolica
inter
reliquas
eminet
elsewhere
he
calls
poetry
or
declares
absolutely
that
fere
non
parit
and
that
lusu
potius
ingenii
quam
pro
scientia
est
music
painting
and
sculpture
are
voluptuous
arts
addison
identified
the
pleasures
of
the
imagination
with
those
produced
by
visible
objects
or
the
ideas
to
which
they
give
rise
such
pleasures
are
not
so
strong
as
those
of
the
senses
nor
so
refined
as
those
of
the
intellect
he
groups
together
the
pleasures
experienced
respectively
in
comparing
imitations
with
the
objects
imitated
and
in
sharpening
by
this
means
the
faculty
of
observation
sidenote
and
the
sensationalism
of
du
bos
and
other
upholders
of
feeling
appears
very
clearly
for
du
bos
art
is
a
pastime
whose
pleasantness
consists
in
the
fact
that
it
occupies
the
mind
without
fatigue
and
has
affinities
with
the
pleasure
provoked
by
gladiatorial
contests
bullfights
and
tourneys
for
these
reasons
whilst
noting
the
importance
in
the
prehistory
of
æsthetic
of
these
new
words
and
the
new
views
they
express
and
while
recognizing
their
value
as
a
ferment
in
the
discussion
of
the
æsthetic
problem
taken
up
by
thinkers
of
the
renaissance
at
the
point
at
which
it
had
been
left
by
the
ancients
we
yet
can
not
discern
in
their
apparition
the
true
origin
of
our
science
by
these
words
and
the
discussions
they
aroused
the
æsthetic
fact

even
louder
and
more
insistently
for
its

justification

attain

confused

of

which
cartesianism
recoiled
in

remarks
that
while

artists
are
able
to
judge
works

very
fairly
they
can
give
no
reason

to
the

indeed

whence
it
appears
plainly
that
in
his
discussion
of
these
perceptions
leibniz
reposes
upon
the
æsthetic
theories
we
discussed
in
the
preceding
chapter
indeed
at
one
point
he
mentions
bouhours
book
sidenote
of
it
might
seem
that
by
according
and
denying
to
æsthetic
facts
leibniz
recognized
that
their
peculiar
character
is
neither
sensuous
nor
intellectual
he
might
seem
to
have
distinguished
them
by
their
from
pleasure
or
and
from
intellect
by
their
lack
of
but
the
and
the
leibnitian
intellectualism
forbid
this
interpretation
in
this
case
obscurity
and
clarity
are
quantitative
degrees
of
one
single
consciousness
distinct
or
intellectual
towards
which
both
converge
and
with
which
in
the
extreme
case
they
unite
to
admit
that
artists
judge
with
confused
perceptions
clear
but
not
distinct
does
not
involve
denying
that
these
perceptions
may
be
capable
of
being
connected
and
verified
by
intellectual
consciousness
the
object
that
is
confusedly
though
clearly
recognized
by
imagination
is
recognized
clearly
and
distinctly
by
the
intellect
which
amounts
to
saying
that
a
work
of
art
may
be
perfected
by
being
determined
by
thought
in
the
very
terminology
adopted
by
leibniz
who
represents
sense
and
imagination
as
obscure
and
confused
there
is
a
tinge
of
contempt
as
well
as
the
suggestion
of
a
single
form
of
all
cognition
this
will
help
us
to
understand
leibniz
definition
of
music
as
arithmeticae
occultum
nescientis
se
numerare
elsewhere
he
says
but
principal
de

the
attributed
to
æsthetic
fact
is
not
specifically
different
from
but
rather
a
partial
anticipation
of
the
of
intellect
undoubtedly
this
distinction
of
degree
marks
a
great
advance
but
careful
analysis
shows
that
leibniz
does
not
differ
fundamentally
from
those
who
by
inventing
the
new
words
and
empirical
distinctions
examined
above
called
attention
to
the
peculiarities
of
æsthetic
facts
sidenote
on
we
find
the
same
invincible
intellectualism
in
the
speculations
on
language
greatly
in
vogue
at
the
time
when
critics
of
the
renaissance
and
sixteenth
century
tried
to
rise
above
merely
empirical
and
practical
grammar
and
strove
to
reduce
grammatical
science
to
a
systematic
form
they
fell
into
logicism
and
described
grammatical
forms
by
such
terms
as

improper

elliptic

reason
exclusive
of
interjections
which
are
not

but
merely
sounds
expressive
of

he
denies
the

amongst
recognized
philosophers
who
studied
the
philosophy
of
grammar
and
noted
the
merits
and
defects
of
various
tongues
we
find
bacon
in
claude
lancelot
and
arnauld
brought
out
the
générale
et
raisonnée
de
a
work
applying
the
intellectualism
of
descartes
rigorously
to
grammatical
forms
and
dominated
by
the
doctrine
of
the
artificial
nature
of
language
locke
and
leibniz
both
speculated
about
language
but
neither
succeeded
in
creating
a
fresh
point
of
view
although
the
latter
did
much
to
provoke
inquiry
into
the
historical
origin
of
languages
all
his
life
leibniz
cherished
the
notion
of
a
universal
language
and
of
an
characteristica
as
a
combination
likely
to
result
in
great
scientific
discoveries
prior
to
him
wilkins
had
fostered
the
same
hope
nor
indeed
in
spite
of
its
utter
absurdity
is
it
even
yet
wholly
extinct
sidenote
in
order
to
correct
the
æsthetic
ideas
of
leibniz
it
was
necessary
to
alter
the
very
foundations
of
his
system
the
cartesianism
upon
which
it
rested
this
could
not
be
undertaken
by
disciples
of
his
own
personal
school
in
whom
we
notice
rather
an
increase
of
intellectualism
giving
scholastic
form
to
the
brilliant
observations
of
the
master
johann
christian
wolff
system
began
with
the
theory
of
knowledge
conceived
as
an
organon
or
instrument
followed
by
systems
of
natural
law
ethics
and
politics
together
constituting
the
organon
of
practical
activity
the
remainder
was
theology
and
metaphysics
or
pneumatology
and
physics
doctrine
of
the
soul
and
doctrine
of
phenomenal
nature
although
wolff
distinguishes
a
productive
imagination
ruled
by
the
principle
of
sufficient
reason
from
the
merely
associative
and
chaotic
yet
a
science
of
imagination
considered
as
a
new
theoretical
value
could
find
no
niche
in
his
schematism
knowledge
of
a
lower
order
as
such
belonged
to
pneumatology
and
was
incapable
of
possessing
its
own
organon
at
most
it
could
be
brought
under
the
organon
already
existing
which
corrected
and
transcended
it
by
means
of
logical
knowledge
in
the
same
way
in
which
ethics
treats
the
appetitiva
as
in
france
the
poetics
of
boileau
corresponded
with
the
philosophy
of
descartes
so
in
germany
the
rationalistic
poetics
of
gottsched
reflect
the
theories
of
wolff
sidenote
for
an
organon
of
inferior
it
was
no
doubt
dimly
seen
that
even
in
the
inferior
faculties
some
distinction
was
operative
between
perfect
and
imperfect
value
and
a
passage
in
a
book
by
the
leibnitian
bülffinger
has
often
been
quoted
where
he
says
existerent
qui
circa
facultatem
sentiendi
imaginandi
attendendi
abstrahendi
et
memoriam
praestarent
quod
bonus
ille
aristoteles
adeo
hodie
omnibus
sordens
praestitit
circa
intellectum
hoc
est
ut
in
artis
formant
redigerent
quicquid
ad
illas
in
suo
usu
dirigendas
et
iuvandas
pertinet
et
conducid
quem
ad
modum
aristoteles
in
organo
logicam
sive
facultatem
demonstrandi
redegit
in
but
on
reading
the
extract
in
its
context
one
recognizes
at
once
that
the
desired
organon
would
have
been
merely
a
series
of
recipes
for
strengthening
the
memory
educating
the
attention
and
so
forth
a
technique
in
a
word
not
an
æsthetic
similar
ideas
had
been
spread
in
italy
by
trevisano
who
by
declaring
that
the
senses
might
be
educated
through
the
mind
asserted
the
possibility
of
an
of
which
should
endow
manners
with
prudence
and
judgement
with
good
taste
we
notice
moreover
that
in
his
day
bülffinger
was
counted
a
depreciator
of
poetry
so
much
so
that
a
tract
against
him
was
written
in
order
to
show
that
poetry
does
not
diminish
the
faculty
of
clear
conception
bodmer
and
breitinger
were
ready
to
deduce
all
the
parts
of
eloquence
with
mathematical
precision
and
the
latter
sketched
a
logic
of
the
imagination
to
which
he
would
have
assigned
the
study
of
similitudes
and
metaphors
even
had
he
carried
out
his
project
it
is
difficult
to
see
how
it
could
have
differed
materially
from
a
philosophic
point
of
view
from
the
treatises
on
the
subject
written
by
the
italian
rhetoricians
of
the
seventeenth
century
sidenote
baumgarten
his
æsthetic
these
discussions
and
experiments
filled
the
boyhood
and
helped
to
form
the
intellect
of
young
alexander
gottlieb
baumgarten
of
berlin
a
follower
of
the
philosophy
of
wolff
and
at
the
same
time
student
and
teacher
of
latin
rhetoric
and
poetry
these
studies
led
him
to
reconsider
the
problem
and
search
for
some
method
by
which
the
precepts
of
rhetoricians
could
be
reduced
to
a
rigorous
philosophical
system
on
taking
his
doctor
degree
in
september
when
years
old
he
published
a
thesis
philosophicae
de
nonnullis
ad
poēma
in
which
the
word
æsthetic
appears
for
the
first
time
as
name
of
a
special
science
baumgarten
always
remained
much
attached
to
his
youthful
discovery
and
in
when
called
to
teach
at
the
university
of
and
again
in

gave
by
request
a
course
of
lectures
on

printed
a
voluminous
treatise
wherein
the
word

attained
the
honours
of

published

more
slender

and
finally
death

him

these
in

are
the
truths
displayed
by
baumgarten
in
his
and
with
many
distinctions
and
examples
in
his
sidenote
of
judgements
based
on
nearly
all
german
critics
are
of
opinion
that
from
his
own
conception
of
æsthetic
as
the
science
of
sensitive
cognition
baumgarten
should
have
evolved
a
species
of
inductive
logic
but
he
can
be
cleared
of
this
accusation
a
better
philosopher
perhaps
than
his
critics
he
held
that
an
inductive
logic
must
always
be
intellectual
since
it
leads
to
abstractions
and
the
formation
of
concepts
the
relation
existing
between
and
the
poetical
and
artistic
facts
which
belong
to
the
realm
of
taste
had
been
shown
before
his
day
by
leibniz
neither
he
nor
wolff
nor
any
other
of
their
school
ever
dreamed
of
transforming
a
treatment
of
the
or
into
an
inductive
logic
on
the
other
hand
as
a
kind
of
compensation
these
critics
attribute
to
baumgarten
a
merit
he
can
not
claim
at
least
to
the
extent
implied
by
their
praises
according
to
them
he
effected
a
revolution
by
converting
leibniz
differences
of
degree
or
quantitative
distinctions
into
a
specific
difference
and
turning
confused
knowledge
into
something
no
longer
negative
but
positive
by
attributing
a
to
sensitive
cognition
and
by
thus
destroying
the
unity
of
the
leibnitian
monad
and
breaking
up
the
law
of
continuity
founded
the
science
of
æsthetic
had
he
really
accomplished
such
a
giant
stride
his
claim
to
the
title
of
father
of
æsthetic
would
have
been
placed
beyond
question
but
in
order
to
win
this
appellation
baumgarten
ought
to
have
been
successful
in
unravelling
all
those
contradictions
in
which
he
was
involved
no
less
than
leibniz
and
all
intellectualists
it
is
not
enough
to
posit
a
even
leibniz
did
that
when
he
attributed
to
confused
cognition
which
when
devoid
of
clearness
remains
obscure
that
is
to
say
imperfect
it
was
imperative
that
this
perfection
should
be
upheld
against
the
continui
and
kept
uncontaminated
by
any
intellectualistic
admixture
otherwise
he
was
bound
to
fall
back
into
the
pathless
labyrinth
of
the
probable
which
is
and
is
not
false
of
the
wit
which
is
and
is
not
intellect
of
the
taste
which
is
and
is
not
intellectual
judgement
of
the
imagination
and
feeling
which
are
and
are
not
sensibility
and
material
pleasure
and
in
that
case
notwithstanding
the
new
name
notwithstanding
as
we
freely
admit
the
greater
insistence
than
that
of
leibniz
upon
the
sensible
nature
of
poetry
æsthetic
as
a
science

not
have
been
born

of
now
baumgarten
overcame
none
of
the
obstacles
above
mentioned
unprejudiced
and
continued
study
of
his
works
forces
one
to
this
conclusion
already
in
his
he
does
not
seem
able
to
distinguish
clearly
between
imagination
and
intellect
confused
and
distinct
cognition
the
law
of
continuity
leads
him
to
set
up
a
scale
of
more
and
less

cognitions
the
obscure

less
poetical
than
the
confused
the
distinct

not
poetical
but
even
those
of
the
higher
kinds
that
is
the
distinct
and

are
to
a
certain
extent
poetical
in

as
they
are

more

baumgarten
expounds
his
thought
more
fully
and
thereby
exposes
its
defects
if
the
introduction
of
the
book
leads
one
to
believe
that
he
sees
æsthetic
truth
to
consist
in
consciousness
of
the
individual
the
belief
is
shattered
by
the
explanations
which
follow
as
a
good
objectivist
he
asserts
that
truth
in
the
metaphysical
sense
has
its
counterpart
in
the
soul
namely
subjective
truth
logical
truth
in
a
wide
sense
or
and
the
complete
truth
lies
not
in
the
genus
or
species
but
in
the
individual
the
genus
is
true
the
species
more
true

most
true

acquired

so
much
being
granted
logical
truth
differs
from
æsthetic

this

objective
truth
is
presented
now
to
the
intellect
when
it
is

narrow
sense

these
paragraphs
highly
important
as
revealing
the
true
thought
of
baumgarten
we
turn
once
more
to
the
introduction
to
his
work
we
notice
at
once
his
commonplace
and
erroneous
conception
of
the
poetic
faculty
to
a
friend
who
suggested
that
there
was
no
need
for
him
to
concern
himself
with

or

consciousness

because

and
because

baumgarten
replied
that
confusion
is
a
condition
wherein
to
find

no
sudden
leap
from

to

that

that

this
is
still
the
attitude
of
leibniz
trevisano
and
bülffinger
baumgarten
is
terrified
lest
he
should
be
accused
of
treating
subjects
unworthy
a
philosopher
says
he
to
himself
dost
thou
professor
of
theoretic
and
moral
philosophy
dare
to
praise
lies
and
mixtures
of
true
and
false
as
though
they
were
noble
works
and
if
there
is
one
thing
above
all
others
from
which
he
is
anxious
to
guard
himself
it
is
sensualism
unbridled
and
the
sensitive
perfection
of
cartesianism
and
wolffianism
was
liable
to
be
confused
with
simple
pleasure
with
the
feeling
of
the
perfection
of
our
organism
but
baumgarten
falls
into
no
such
confusion
when
in
one
quistorp
combated
his
æsthetic
theory
by
saying
that
if
poetry
consisted
in
sensuous
perfection
it
was
a
thing
hurtful
to
men
baumgarten
answered
disdainfully
that
he
did
not
expect
he
should
ever
find
time
to
reply
to
a
critic
of
such
calibre
as
to
mistake
his
perfecta
for
an
that
is
sidenote
names
and
old
save
in
its
title
and
its
first
definitions
baumgarten
is
covered
with
the
mould
of
antiquity
and
commonplace
we
have
seen
that
he
refers
back
to
aristotle
and
cicero
for
the
first
principles
of
his
science
in
another
instance
he
attaches
his
æsthetic
to
the
rhetoric
of
antiquity
quoting
the
truth
enunciated
by
zeno
the
stoic
duo
cogitandi
genera
alterum
perpetuum
et
latius
quod

alterum

et
contractius
quod
dialectices
and
identifying
the
former
with
the
æsthetic
horizon
the
latter
with
the
logical
in
his
he
rests
upon
scaliger
and
vossius
of
modern
writers
beside
the
philosophers
leibniz
wolff
bülffinger
he
quotes
gottsched
arnold
werenfels
breitinger
by
means
of
these
latter
he
is
able
to
make
acquaintance
with
discussions
upon
taste
and
imagination
even
without
direct
acquaintance
with
addison
and
du
bos
as
well
as
the
italians
whose
writings
had
immense
vogue
in
germany
in
his
day
and
with
whom
his
resemblances
leap
to
the
eye
baumgarten
always
feels
himself
to
be
in
perfect
accord
with
his
predecessors
never
at
variance
with
them
he
never
felt

presentation
of
the
problem
of
æsthetic
still
clamouring
for
solution
in
a
voice
so
much
the
stronger
as
it
uttered
a
commonplace
he
proclaims
a
new
science
and
presents
it
in
conventional
scholastic
form
the
babe
about
to
be
born
receives
the
name
of
æsthetic
by
premature
baptism
at
his
hands
and
the
name
remains
but
the
new
name
is
devoid
of
new
matter
the

no

our
good
baumgarten
full
of
ardour
and
conviction
and
often
curiously
brisk
and
vivacious
in
his
scholastic
latinism
is
a
most
sympathetic
and
attractive
figure
in
the

æsthetic

as

by
putting
aside
the
concept
of

and
conceiving
imagination
in
a
novel
manner
actually
discovered
the
true
nature
of

and

so

speak
invented
the

was
the
italian
giambattista
vico
ten
years
prior
to
the
publication
in
germany
of
baumgarten
first
treatise
there
had
appeared
in
naples
the
first
nuova
which
developed
ideas
on
the
nature
of
poetry
outlined
in
a
former
work
constantia
iurisprudentis
outcome
of
years
continuous
and
harsh
meditation
in
vico
republished
it
with
fresh
developments
which
gave
rise
to
two
special
books
sapienza
and
discoperta
del
vero
in
the
second
nor
did
he
ever
tire
of
repeating
his
views
and
forcing
them
upon
the
attention
of
his
hostile
contemporaries
at
every
opportunity
seizing
such
occasion
even
in
prefaces
and
letters
poems
on
the
occasion
of
weddings
or
funerals
and
in
such
press
notices
as
fell
to
his
duty
as
public
censor
of
literature
and
what
were
these
ideas
neither
more
nor
less
we
may
say
than
the
solution
of
the
problem
stated
by
plato
attacked
but
not
solved
by
aristotle
and
again
vainly
attacked
during
the
renaissance
and
afterwards
is
poetry
rational
or
irrational
spiritual
or
brutal
and
if
spiritual
what
is
its
special
nature
and
what
distinguishes
it
from
history
and
science
as
we
know
plato
confined
it
within
the
baser
part
of
the
soul
the
animal
spirits
vico
it
and
makes
of
it
a
period
in
the
history
of
humanity
and
since
history
for
him
means
an
ideal
history
whose
periods
consist
not
of
contingent
facts
but
of
forms
of
the
spirit
he
makes
it
a
moment
in
the
ideal
history
of
the
spirit
a
form
of
consciousness
poetry
precedes
intellect
but
follows
sense
through
confusing
it
with
the
latter
plato
failed
to
grasp
the
position
it
should
really
occupy
and
banished
it
from
his
republic
men
at
first
feel
without
being
aware
next
they
become
aware
with
a
perturbed
and
agitated
soul
finally
they
reflect
with
an
undisturbed
mind
this
aphorism
is
the
principle
of
poetical
sentences
which
are
formed
by
the
sense
of
passions
and
affections
differing
thereby
from
philosophical
sentences
which
are
formed
by
reflexion
through
ratiocination
whence
the
latter
approach
more
nearly
to
truth
the
more
they
rise
towards
the
universal
while
the
former
have
more
of
certainty
the
more
they
approach
the
individual
an
imaginative
phase
of
consciousness
but
one
possessed
of
positive
value
sidenote
and
philosophy
imagination
and
the
imaginative
phase
is
altogether
independent
and
autonomous
with
respect
to
the
intellectual
which
is
not
only
incapable
of
endowing
it
with
any
fresh
perfection
but
can
only
destroy
it
the
studies
of
metaphysics
and
poetry
are
in
natural
opposition
one
to
the
other
for
the
former
purges
the
mind
of
childish
prejudice
and
the
latter
immerses
and
drowns
it
in
the
same
the
former
offers
resistance
to
the
judgement
of
the
senses
while
the
latter
makes
this
its
chief
rule
the
former
debilitates
the
latter
strengthens
imagination
the
former
prides
itself
in
not
turning
spirit
into
body
the
latter
does
its
utmost
to
give
a
body
to
spirit
hence
the
thoughts
of
the
former
must
necessarily
be
abstract
while
the
concepts
of
the
latter
show
best
when
most
clothed
with
matter
to
sum
up
the
former
strives
that
the
learned
may
know
the
truth
of
things
stripped
of
all
passion
the
latter
that
the
vulgar
may
act
truly
by
means
of
intense
excitement
of
the
senses
without
which
stimulant
they
assuredly
would
not
act
at
all
hence
from
all
time
in
all
languages
known
to
man
never
has
there
been
a
strong
man
equally
great
as
metaphysician
and
poet
such
a
poet
as
homer
father
and
prince
of
poetry
poets
are
the
senses
philosophers
the
intellect
of
mankind
imagination
is
stronger
in
proportion
as
reason
is
weaker
no
doubt
reflexion
may
be
put
in
verse
but
it
does
not
become
poetry
thereby
abstract
sentences
belong
to
philosophers
since
they
contain
universals
and
reflexions
concerning
such
passions
are
made
by
poets
who
are
false
and
frigid
those
poets
who
sing
of
the
beauty
and
virtue
of
ladies
by
reflexion
are
philosophers
arguing
in
verses
or
in
one
set
of
ideas
belongs
to
philosophers
another
to
poets
these
latter
are
identical
with
those
of
painters
from
which
they
differ
only
in
colours
and
words
great
poets
are
born
not
in
epochs
of
reflexion
but
in
those
of
imagination
generally
called
barbarous
homer
in
the
barbarism
of
antiquity
dante
in
that
of
the
middle
ages
the
second
barbarism
of
italy
those
who
have
chosen
to
read
philosophic
reason
into
the
verse
of
the
great
father
of
greek
poetry
have
transferred
the
character
of
a
later
age
into
an
earlier
since
the
era
of
poets
precedes
that
of
philosophers
and
countries
in
infancy
were
sublime
poets
poetic
locutions
arose
before
prose
by
the
necessity
of
nature
not
by
caprice
of
pleasure
fables
or
imaginative
universals
were
conceived
before
reasoned
philosophical
universals
with
these
observations
vico
justified
and
at
the
same
time
corrected
the
opinion
of
plato
in
the
denying
to
homer
wisdom
every
kind
of
wisdom
the
legislative
of
lycurgus
and
solon
the
philosophic
of
thales
anacharsis
and
pythagoras
the
strategic
of
military
commanders
to
homer
he
says
belongs
wisdom
undoubtedly
but
poetic
wisdom
only
the
homeric
images
and
comparisons
derived
from
wild
beasts
and
the
elements
of
savage
nature
are
incomparable
but
such
success
does
not
spring
from
talent
imbued
with
domesticity
and
civilized
with
any
philosophy
when
anybody
takes
to
writing
poetry
in
an
era
of
reflexion
it
is
because
he
is
returning
to
childhood
and
putting
his
mind
in
fetters
no
longer
reflecting
with
his
intellect
he
follows
imagination
and
loses
himself
in
the
particular
if
a
true
poet
dallies
with
philosophical
ideas
it
is
not
that
he
may
assimilate
them
and
dismiss
imagination
but
merely
that
he
may
have
them
in
front
of
him
to
examine
as
though
on
a
stage
or
public
platform
the
new
comedy
which
made
its
appearance
after
socrates
is
undeniably
impregnated
with
philosophic
ideas
with
intellectual
universals
with
intelligible
kinds
of
human
conduct
but
its
authors
were
poets
in
so
far
only
as
they
knew
how
to
transform
logic
into
imagination
and
their
ideas
into
portraits
sidenote
and
the
dividing
line
between
art
and
science
imagination
and
intellect
is
here
very
strongly
drawn
the
two
distinct
activities
are
repeatedly
contrasted
with
a
sharpness
that
leaves
no
room
for
confusion
the
line
of
demarcation
between
poetry
and
history
is
hardly
less
firm
while
not
quoting
aristotle
passage
vico
implicitly
shows
why
poetry
seemed
to
aristotle
more
philosophical
than
history
and
at
the
same
time
he
dispels
the
erroneous
opinion
that
history
concerns
the
particular
and
poetry
the
universal
poetry
joins
hands
with
science
not
because
it
consists
in
the
contemplation
of
concepts
but
because
like
science
it
is
ideal
the
most
beautiful
poetic
story
must
be
wholly
ideal
by
means
of
idea
the
poet
breathes
reality
into
things
otherwise
unreal
masters
of
poetry
claim
that
their
art
must
be
wholly
compact
of
imagination
like
a
painter
of
the
ideal
not
imitative
like
a
whence
from
their
likeness
to
god
the
creator
poets
and
painters
alike
are
called
divine
and
against
those
who
blame
poets
for
telling
stories
which
they
say
are
untrue
vico
protests
the
best
stories
are
those
approximating
most
nearly
to
ideal
truth
the
eternal
truth
of
god
it
is
immeasurably
more
certain
than
the
truth
of
historians
who
often
bring
into
play
caprice
necessity
or
fortune
but
such
a
captain
as
for
instance
tasso
godfrey
is
the
type
of
a
captain
of
all
times
of
all
nations
and
so
are
all
personages
of
poetry
whatever
difference
there
may
be
in
sex
age
temperament
custom
nation
republic
grade
condition
or
fortune
they
are
nothing
save
the
eternal
properties
of
the
human
soul
rationally
discussed
by
politicians
economists
and
moral
philosophers
and
painted
as
portraits
by
the
poet
referring
to
an
observation
made
by
castelvetro
and
approving
it
in
part
to
the
effect
that
if
poetry
is
a
presentiment
of
the
possible
it
should
be
preceded
by
history
imitation
of
the
real
yet
finding
himself
confronted
by
the
difficulty
that
nevertheless
poets
invariably
precede
historians
vico
solves
the
problem
by
identifying
history
with
poetry
primitive
history
was
poetry
its
plot
was
narration
of
fact
and
homer
was
the
first
historian
or
rather
he
was
a
heroic
character
amongst
greek
men
in
so
far
as
they
poetically
narrated
their
own
history
poetry
and
history
therefore
are
originally
identical
or
rather
undifferentiated
but
inasmuch
as
it
is
not
possible
to
give
false
ideas
since
falsity
arises
from
an
embroiled
combination
of
ideas
so
is
it
impossible
to
give
a
tradition
however
fabulous
that
has
not
had
at
the
beginning
a
basis
of
truth
hence
we
gain
an
entirely
new
insight
into
mythology
it
is
no
longer
an
arbitrary
calculated
invention
but
a
spontaneous
vision
of
truth
as
it
presented
itself
to
the
spirit
of
primitive
man
poetry
gives
an
imaginative
vision
science
or
philosophy
intelligible
truth
history
the
consciousness
of
certitude
sidenote
and
language
and
poetry
are
in
vico
estimation
substantially
the
same
in
refuting
the
vulgar
error
of
grammarians
who
maintain
the
priority
of
the
birth
of
prose
over
that
of
verse
he
finds
within
the
origin
of
poetry
so
far
as
it
has
been
herein
discovered
the
origin
of
languages
and
the
origin
of
letters
this
discovery
was
made
by
vico
after
toil
as
disagreeable
and
overwhelming
as
we
should
undergo
had
we
to
strip
off
our
own
nature
and
enter
into
that
of
the
primæval
men
of
hobbes
grotius
or
puffendorf
creatures
possessing
no
language
at
all
by
whom
were
created
the
languages
of
the
ancient
world
but
his
painful
labour
was
richly
repaid
by
his
refutation
of
the
erroneous
theory
that
languages
sprang
from
convention
or
as
he
said
signified
at
will
whereas
it
is
evident
that
from
their
natural
origin
words
must
have
had
natural
meanings
this
is
plainly
seen
in
common
latin
wherein
almost
all
words
have
arisen
by
natural
necessity
either
from
natural
properties
or
from
their
sensible
effects
and
in
general
metaphor
forms
the
bulk
of
language
in
the
case
of
every
people
this
argument
strikes
a
blow
at
another
common
error
of
the
grammarians
that
the
language
of
prose
writers
is
correct
that
of
poets
incorrect
the
poetic
tropes
grouped
under
the
heading
of
metonymy
seem
to
vico
to
be
born
of
the
nature
of
primitive
peoples
not
of
capricious
selection
by
men
skilled
in
poetic
art
stories
told
by
means
of
similitudes
imagery
and
comparisons
result
from
lack
of
the
genera
and
species
required
to
define
things
with
propriety
and
are
therefore
by
reason
of
natural
necessities
common
to
entire
peoples
the
earliest
languages
must
have
consisted
of
dumb
gestures
and
objects
which
had
natural
connexions
with
the
ideas
to
be
expressed
he
observes
very
acutely
that
to
these
figurate
languages
belong
not
only
hieroglyphics
but
the
emblems
knightly
bearings
devices
and
blazons
which
he
calls
mediæval
hieroglyphics
in
the
barbarous
middle
ages
italy
was
forced
to
fall
back
on
the
mute
language
of
the
earliest
gentile
nations
in
which
men
before
discovering
articulate
speech
were
obliged
like
mutes
to
use
actions
or
objects
having
natural
connexions
with
the
ideas
which
at
that
time
must
have
been
exceedingly
sensuous
of
the
things
which
they
wished
to
signify
such
expressions
clad
in
almost
vocal
words
must
have
had
all
the
lively
expressiveness
of
poetic
diction
hence
arise
three
kinds
or
phases
of
language
dumb
show
the
language
of
the
gods
heraldic
language
or
that
of
the
heroes
and
spoken
language
vico
also
looked
forward
to
a
universal
system
of
etymology
a
dictionary
of
mental
words
common
to
all
nations
sidenote
and
a
man
with
ideas
of
this
sort
about
imagination
language
and
poetry
could
not
say
he
was
satisfied
with
formalistic
and
verbal
logic
whether
aristotelian
or
scholastic
the
human
mind
says
vico
makes
use
of
intellect
when
from
things
which
it
feels
by
sense
it
gathers
something
that
does
not
fall
under
sense
this
is
the
true
meaning
of
the
latin
in
a
rapid
outline
of
the
history
of
logic
vico
wrote
aristotle
came
and
taught
the
syllogism
a
method
more
suited
to
expound
universals
in
their
particulars
than
to
unite
particulars
by
the
discovery
of
universals
then
came
zeno
with
his
sorites
which
corresponds
with
modern
philosophic
methods
and
refines
without
sharpening
the
wits
and
no
advantage
whatever
was
reaped
from
either
by
mankind
at
large
with
great
reason
therefore
does
verulam
equally
eminent
as
politician
and
philosopher
propound
commend
and
illustrate
induction
in
his
organum
he
is
followed
by
the
english
with
excellent
results
to
experimental
philosophy
from
this
source
is
derived
his
criticism
of
mathematics
which
have
always
but
especially
in
his
day
been
considered
as
the
type
of
perfect
science
sidenote
vico
opposed
to
all
formal
theories
of
poetry
in
all
this
vico
is
not
only
a
thorough
revolutionary
but
is
quite
conscious
of
being
so
he
knows
himself
to
be
in
opposition
to
all
previous
theories
on
the
subject
he
says
that
his
new
principles
of
poetry
are
wholly
opposed
to
and
not
merely
different
from
all
which
have
been
imagined
from
the
time
of
plato
and
his
disciple
aristotle
to
patrizzi
scaliger
and
castelvetro
among
the
moderns
poetry
is
now
discovered
to
have
been
the
first
language
used
by
all
nations
alike
even
the
hebrew
in
another
passage
he
says
that
by
his
theories
is
overthrown
all
that
has
ever
been
said
of
the
origin
of
poetry
beginning
from
plato
and
aristotle
right
down
to
our
own
patrizzi
scaliger
and
castelvetro
and
it
is
found
that
poetry
arising
through
defect
of
human
ratiocination
is
as
sublime
as
any
which
owes
its
being
to
the
later
rise
of
philosophy
and
the
arts
of
composition
and
criticism
indeed
that
these
later
sources
never
gave
rise
to
any
poetry
that
could
equal
far
less
surpass
it
in
the
autobiography
he
boasts
of
having
discovered
other
principles
of
poetry
than
those
found
by
greeks
and
latins
and
all
others
from
those
times
down
to
the
present
day
on
these
are
founded
other
views
on
mythology
these
ancient
principles
of
poetry
laid
down
first
by
plato
and
confirmed
by
aristotle
had
been
the
anticipation
or
prejudice
which
had
misled
all
writers
on
poetic
reason
among
whom
he
cites
jacopo
mazzoni
statements
even
of
most
serious
philosophers
such
as
patrizzi
and
others
upon
the
origin
of
song
and
verse
are
so
inept
that
he
blushes
even
to
mention
them
it
is
curious
to
see
him
annotating
the
of
horace
with
a
view
to
finding
some
plausible
sense
in
it
by
applying
the
principles
of
the
it
is
probable
that
he
was
familiar
with
the
writings
of
muratori
among
contemporaries
for
he
quotes
him
by
name
and
of
gravina
who
was
a
personal
acquaintance
but
if
he
read
the
and
the
della
he
could
not
have
been
satisfied
by
the
treatment
meted
out
to
the
faculty
of
imagination
so
highly
valued
and
respected
by
himself
and
if
gravina
influenced
him
at
all
it
must
have
been
by
provoking
him
to
contradiction
in
this
latter
if
not
directly
in
such
french
writers
as
le
bossu
he
may
have
met
with
the
fallacy
of
regarding
homer
as
a
repository
of
wisdom
a
fallacy
which
he
combated
with
vigour
and
pertinacity
in
his
estimation
among
the
gravest
faults
of
the
cartesians
was
their
inability
to
appreciate
the
world
of
imagination
and
poetry
of
his
own
times
he
complained
they
were
benumbed
by
analytical
methods
and
by
a
philosophy
which
sought
to
deaden
every
faculty
of
soul
which
reached
it
through
the
body
especially
that
of
imagination
now
held
to
be
mother
of
all
human
error
times
of
a
wisdom
which
freezes
the
generous
soul
of
the
best
poetry
and
prevents
all
understanding
of
it
sidenote
of
grammarians
and
linguists
who
preceded
it
is
just
the
same
with
the
theory
of
language
the
manner
of
birth
and
the
nature
of
languages
has
been
the
cause
of
much
painful
toil
and
meditation
nor
from
the
of
plato
in
which
in
our
other
works
we
have
falsely
delighted
and
believed
he
alludes
to
the
doctrine
followed
by
him
in
his
own
first
book
antiquissima
italorum
down
to
wolfgang
latius
julius
cæsar
scaliger
francisco
sanchez
and
others
can
we
find
anything
to
satisfy
our
understanding
so
much
that
in
discussing
matters
of
this
kind
signor
giovanni
clerico
says
there
is
nothing
in
philology
involved
in
such
a
maze
of
doubt
and
difficulty
the
chief
do
not
escape
criticism
grammar
says
he
lays
down
rules
for
speaking
correctly
logic
for
speaking
truly
and
since
in
the
order
of
nature
we
must
speak
truly
before
learning
to
speak
correctly
giulio
cesare
della
scala
followed
by
the
best
grammarians
employs
all
his
magnificent
energy
to
reason
to
the
causes
of
the
latin
language
from
the
principles
of
logic
but
his
great
design
ended
in
failure
for
this
reason
that
he
attached
himself
to
the
logical
principles
of
a
single
philosopher
namely
aristotle
whose
principles
are
too
universal
to
explain
the
almost
infinite
particulars
which
naturally
beset
him
who
would
reason
concerning
a
language
whence
it
happened
that
francisco
sanchez
who
followed
him
with
admirable
zeal
attempting
in
his
to
explain
the
innumerable
particles
which
are
found
in
latin
by
his
famous
principle
of
ellipsis
and
trying
thereby
though
without
success
to
vindicate
the
logical
principles
of
aristotle
fell
into
the
most
cumbrous
clumsinesses
among
an
almost
innumerable
host
of
latin
phrases
whereby
he
meant
to
make
good
the
slight
and
subtle
omissions
employed
by
latin
in
expressing
its
meaning
the
origin
of
parts
of
speech
and
syntax
is
wholly
different
from
that
assigned
to
them
by
folk
who
fancied
that
the
people
who
invented
language
must
first
have
gone
to
school
to
aristotle
the
same
criticism
undoubtedly
must
have
extended
to
the
of
for
vico
remarked
that
the
logic
of
arnauld
was
built
on
the
same
plan
as
that
of
aristotle
sidenote
of
seventeenth
century
writers
on
it
may
well
be
granted
that
vico
was
more
in
sympathy
with
the
rhetoricians
in
whom
we
have
detected
a
premonition
of
æsthetic
science
for
vico
as
for
them
wit
referring
to
imagination
and
memory
was
the
father
of
all
invention
judgement
concerning
poetry
was
for
him
a
judgement
of
the
senses
a
phrase
equivalent
to
taste
or
good
taste
expressions
never
used
by
him
in
this
connexion
there
is
no
doubt
he
was
familiar
with
the
writers
of
treatises
on
wit
and
conceits
for
in
a
dry
rhetorical
manual
written
for
the
use
of
his
school
in
which
one
looks
in
vain
for
a
shadow
of
his
own
personal
ideas
he
quotes
paolo
beni
pellegrini
pallavicino
and
the
marquis
orsi
he
highly
esteems
treatise
on
and
has
knowledge
of
the
book
by
the
same
author
perhaps
too
his
mind
was
not
unaffected
by
the
flash
of
genius
which
had
enabled
the
jesuit
for
one
instant
to
perceive
that
poetry
consists
of
first
apprehensions
he
does
not
name
tesauro
but
there
is
no
doubt
he
knew
him
indeed
the
includes
a
section
besides
that
on
poetry
upon
blazons
knightly
bearings
military
banners
medals
and
so
forth
precisely
similar
in
method
to
that
of
tesauro
when
he
treats
of
figurate
conceits
in
his
for
tesauro
such
conceits
are
merely
metaphorical
ingenuities
like
any
other
for
vico
they
are
wholly
the
work
of
imagination
for
imagination
expresses
itself
not
in
words
only
but
in
the
mute
language
of
lines
and
colours
he
knew
something
also
of
leibniz
the
great
german
and
newton
were
by
him
described
as
the
greatest
wits
of
the
time
but
he
seems
to
have
remained
in
complete
ignorance
of
the
æsthetic
attempts
of
the
leibnitian
school
in
germany
his
logic
of
poetry
was
a
discovery
independent
of
and
earlier
than
bülffinger
organon
of
the
inferior
faculties
the
of
baumgarten
and
the
der
of
breitinger
in
truth
vico
belongs
on
one
side
to
the
vast
renaissance
reaction
against
formalism
and
scholastic
verbalism
which
beginning
with
the
reaffirmation
of
experience
and
sensation
telesio
campanella
galileo
bacon
was
bound
to
go
on
by
reasserting
the
function
of
imagination
in
individual
and
social
life
on
the
other
side
he
is
a
precursor
of
romanticism
sidenote
in
the
scienza
nuova
the
importance
of
vico
new
poetic
theory
in
his
thought
as
a
whole
as
well
as
in
the
organism
of
his
has
never
been
fully
appreciated
and
the
neapolitan
philosopher
is
still
commonly
regarded
as
the
inventor
of
the
philosophy
of
history
if
by
such
a
science
is
meant
the
attempt
to
deduce
concrete
history
by
ratiocination
and
to
treat
epochs
and
events
as
if
they
were
concepts
the
only
result
of
vico
efforts
to
solve
the
problem
could
have
been
failure
and
the
same
is
true
of
his
many
successors
the
fact
is
that
his
philosophy
of
history
his
ideal
history
his
nuova
d
intorno
alia
comune
natura
delle
nazioni
does
not
concern
the
concrete
empirical
history
which
unfolds
itself
in
time
it
is
not
history
it
is
a
science
of
the
ideal
a
philosophy
of
the
spirit
that
vico
made
many
discoveries
in
history
proper
which
have
been
to
a
great
extent
confirmed
by
modern
criticism
on
the
development
of
the
greek
epic
and
the
nature
and
genesis
of
feudal
society
in
antiquity
and
in
the
middle
ages
certainly
deserves
all
emphasis
but
this
side
of
his
work
must
be
kept
distinctly
apart
from
the
other
strictly
philosophical
side
and
if
the
philosophical
part
is
a
doctrine
expounding
the
ideal
moments
of
the
spirit
or
in
his
own
words
the
modifications
of
our
human
mind
of
these
moments
or
modifications
vico
undertakes
especially
to
define
and
fully
describe
not
the
logical
ethical
and
economic
moments
though
on
these
too
he
throws
much
fight
but
precisely
the
imaginative
or
poetic
the
larger
portion
of
the
second
hinges
on
the
discovery
of
the
creative
imagination
including
the
new
principles
of
poetry
the
observations
on
the
nature
of
language
mythology
writing
symbolic
figures
and
so
forth
all
his
system
of
civilization
of
the
republic
of
laws
of
poetry
of
history
in
a
word
of
humanity
at
large
is
founded
upon
this
discovery
which
constitutes
the
novel
point
of
view
at
which
vico
places
himself
the
author
himself
observes
that
his
second
book
dedicated
to
poetic
wisdom
wherein
is
made
a
discovery
totally
opposed
to
verulam
forms
nearly
the
whole
body
of
the
work
but
the
first
and
third
books
also
deal
almost
exclusively
with
works
of
the
imagination
it
might
be
maintained
therefore
that
vico
new
science
was
really
just
æsthetic
or
at
least
the
philosophy
of
the
spirit
with
special
emphasis
upon
the
philosophy
of
the
æsthetic
spirit
sidenote
among
so
many
luminous
points
or
rather
in
such
a
general
blaze
of
light
there
are
yet
dark
nooks
in
his
mind
corners
that
remain
in
shadow
by
not
maintaining
a
rigid
distinction
between
concrete
history
and
the
philosophy
of
the
spirit
vico
allowed
himself
to
suggest
historical
periods
which
do
not
correspond
with
the
real
periods
but
are
rather
allegories
the
mythological
expression
of
his
philosophy
of
the
spirit
from
the
same
source
arises
the
multiplicity
of
those
periods
usually
three
in
number
which
vico
finds
in
the
history
of
civilization
in
general
in
poetry
and
language
and
practically
every
subject
the
first
peoples
who
were
the
children
of
the
human
race
founded
first
the
world
of
the
arts
next
after
a
long
interval
the
philosophers
who
were
therefore
the
aged
among
nations
founded
the
world
of
the
sciences
with
which
humanity
attained
completion
historically
understood
in
an
approximate
sense
this
scheme
of
evolution
has
some
truth
but
only
an
approximate
truth
in
consequence
of
the
same
confusion
of
history
and
philosophy
he
denied
primitive
peoples
any
kind
of
intellectual
logic
and
conceived
not
only
their
physics
cosmology
astronomy
and
geography
as
poetic
in
character
but
their
morals
their
economy
and
their
politics
as
well
but
not
only
has
there
never
been
a
period
in
concrete
human
history
entirely
poetic
and
ignorant
of
all
abstraction
or
power
of
reasoning
but
such
a
state
can
not
even
be
conceived
morals
politics
physics
all
presuppose
intellectual
work
however
imperfect
they
may
be
the
ideal
priority
of
poetry
can
not
be
materialized
into
a
historical
period
of
civilization
linked
with
this
error
is
another
into
which
vico
often
falls
when
he
asserts
that
the
chief
aim
of
poetry
is
to
teach
the
ignorant
vulgar
to
act
virtuously
and
to
invent
fables
adapted
with
the
popular
understanding
capable
of
producing
strong
emotion
having
regard
to
the
clear
explanations
he
himself
gave
of
the
inessentiality
of
abstractions
and
intellectual
artifice
in
poetry
when
we
remember
that
for
him
poetry
makes
her
own
rules
for
herself
without
consulting
anybody
and
that
he
clearly
established
the
peculiar
theoretical
nature
of
the
imagination
such
a
proposition
can
not
be
taken
as
a
return
to
the
pedagogic
and
heteronomous
theory
of
poetry
which
in
substance
he
had
left
far
behind
therefore
without
doubt
it
follows
from
his
historical
hypothesis
of
a
wholly
poetical
epoch
of
civilization
in
which
education
science
and
morality
were
administered
by
poets
another
consequence
is
that
imaginative
universals
are
apparently
sometimes
understood
by
him
as
imperfect
universals
empirical
or
representative
concepts
as
they
were
subsequently
called
although
on
the
other
hand
individualization
is
so
marked
in
them
and
their
unphilosophical
nature
so
accentuated
that
their
interpretation
as
purely
imaginative
forms
may
be
taken
as
normal
in
conclusion
we
remark
that
fundamental
terms
are
not
always
used
by
vico
in
the
same
sense
it
is
not
always
clear
how
far
sensation
memory
imagination
wit
are
synonymous
or
different
sometimes
sensation
seems
outside
the
spirit
at
others
one
of
its
chief
moments
poets
are
sometimes
the
organ
of
imagination
sometimes
the
sensation
of
humanity
and
imagination
is
described
as
dilated
memory
these
are
the
aberrations
of
a
thought
so
virgin
and
original
that
it
was
not
easy
to
regulate
sidenote
still
to
be
to
sever
the
philosophy
of
the
spirit
from
history
the
modifications
of
the
human
mind
from
the
historic
vicissitudes
of
peoples
and
æsthetic
from
homeric
civilization
and
by
continuing
vico
analyses
to
determine
more
clearly
the
truths
he
uttered
the
distinctions
he
drew
and
the
identities
he
divined
in
short
to
purge
æsthetic
of
the
remains
of
ancient
rhetoric
and
poetics
as
well
as
from
some
schematisms
imposed
upon
her
by
the
author
of
her
being
such
is
the
field
of
labour
such
the
progress
still
to
be
achieved
after
the
discovery
of
the
autonomy
of
the
æsthetic
world

to
the
genius
of

was
made
by
the
venetian
conti
who
left
numerous
sketches
for
essays
on
imagination
the
faculties
of
the
soul
poetic
imitation
and
similar
subjects
designed
for
inclusion
in
a
large
treatise
on
the
beautiful
and
art
conti
had
started
by
professing
ideas
very
like
those
of
du
bos
affirming
that
the
poet
must
put
everything
in
images
that
taste
is
as
indefinable
as
feeling
and
that
there
are
persons
without
taste
just
as
there
are
blind
and
deaf
persons
he
also
wrote
polemical
tracts
against
the
cartesians
later
he
abandoned
his
sensationalistic
or
sentimentalist
theories
and
inquiring
into
the
nature
of
poetry
declared
himself
with
castelvetro
patrizzi
and
even
gravina
had
castelvetro
he
observes
who
writes
so
subtly
of
given
two
or
three
chapters
to
a
philosophical
explanation
of
the
idea
of
imitation
he
would
have
solved
many
questions
raised
but
not
clearly
answered
by
himself
concerning
poetic
theories
in
his
and
in
his
controversy
against
torquato
tasso
patrizzi
never
succeeded
in
clearly
defining
the
philosophical
idea
of
imitation
he
collected
much
useful
information
about
the
history
of
poetry
but
wilfully
lost
the
platonic
doctrine
by
allowing
it
to
mingle
with
the
historical
detail
instead
of
gathering
it
up
without
sophistry
into
a
single
point
when
it
would
have
appeared
in
a
very
different
guise
the
of
gravina
shadows
forth
a
sort
of
philosophical
idea
of
imitation
but
so
wholly
engrossed
is
he
in
deducing
therefrom
rules
for
lyrical
dramatical
and
epic
poetry
and
illustrating
each
with
examples
from
the
most
celebrated
poets
greek
latin
and
italian
that
he
is
too
busy
to
question
the
sufficiency
of
the
fertile
idea
he
has
propounded
a
close
follower
of
contemporary
european
thought
conti
was
familiar
with
hutcheson
whose
theories
he
vigorously
repudiated
observing
why
this
multiplication
of
faculties
the
soul
is
one
and
for
scholastic
convenience
only
has
been
divided
into
three
faculties
sense
imagination
intellect
the
first
concerns
herself
with
objects
present
before
her
imagination
with
those
afar
into
which
memory
gradually
merges
but
the
object
of
sense
and
imagination
is
always
particular
it
is
only
the
mind
the
intellect
the
spirit
that
by
comparing
particulars
apprehends
the
universal
before
introducing
a
new
sense
for
the
pleasure
of
beauty
hutcheson
should
have
assigned
limits
to
these
three
faculties
of
cognition
and
demonstrated
that
the
pleasure
occasioned
by
beauty
does
not
arise
from
the
three
pleasures
of
these
three
faculties
or
from
intellectual
pleasure
alone
to
which
they
all
reduce
if
the
functions
of
the
soul
be
carefully
analysed
thus
it
would
appear
that
the
mistake
of
the
scotchman
arose
from
his
habit
of
separating
pleasure
from
the
cognitive
faculties
placing
the
former
apart
in
a
special
empty
sense
of
beauty
on
the
other
hand
when
rewriting
the
history
of
the
opinions
of
various
critics
upon
the
aristotelian
doctrine
of
the
universal
in
poetry
conti
gave
much
weight
to
the
dialogue
seu
de
of
fracastoro
for
an
instant
he
seems
on
the
point
of
grasping
the
essence
of
the
poetic
universal
and
identifying
it
with
the
characteristic
which
makes
us
call
even
horrible
things
wholly
beautiful
in
all
his
journeys
balzac
never
saw
a
beautiful
old
woman
in
the
poetic
or
picturesque
sense
an
old
woman
is
highly
beautiful
if
depicted
as
having
suffered
all
the
dilapidations
of
age
immediately
after
however
he
identifies
the
characteristic
with
wolff
concept
of
perfection
it
does
not
differ
from
being
nor
does
being
differ
from
the
truth
which
the
schoolmen
call
transcendental
and
which
is
the
object
of
all
arts
and
all
sciences
we
call
it
the
object
of
poetry
when
by
means
of
imaginary
presentations
it
ravishes
the
intellect
and
moves
the
wall
transporting
both
these
faculties
into
the
ideal
and
archetypal
world
of
which
following
augustine
father
malebranche
discourses
at
length
in
his
de
la
in
the
same
way
fracastoro
universal
gives
place
to
the
universal
of
science
owing
to
the
infinity
of
their
determinations
all
we
can
know
of
particulars
is
their
common
properties
which
is
merely
another
manner
of
saying
that
we
have
no
science
save
of
universal
thus
it
is
precisely
the
same
if
we
say
the
object
of
poetry
is
science
or
the
universal
which
is
the
doctrine
of
navagero
following
aristotle
the
imaginative
universals
of
signor
vico
with
whom
he
had
interchanged
some
letters
opened
no
new
views
for
him
he
notes
that
signor
vico
talks
a
great
deal
about
them
and
holds
that
the
most
uncivilized
men
having
framed
them
not
from
any
wish
to
please
or
serve
others
but
from
the
necessity
of
expressing
their
feelings
as
nature
taught
them
spoke
in
poetical
language
the
elements
of
a
theology
a
physics
and
an
ethics
wholly
poetical
conti
excuses
himself
from
immediate
examination
of
this
critical
question
and
only
opines
that
it
can
be
shown
in
many
ways
that
these
imaginative
universals
are
the
material
or
object
of
poetry
in
so
far
as
they
contain
within
them
sciences
or
things
considered
in
themselves
a
conclusion
diametrically
opposed
to
that
which
signor
vico
meant
to
express
conti
is
next
obliged
to
ask
himself
how
it
is
possible
that
poetry
object
should
be
not
the
true
but
the
probable
when
the
universal
of
poetry
is
the
same
as
that
of
science
he
answers
by
coming
down
to
the
commonplace
level
of
a
baumgarten
when
sciences
receive
a
particular
colouring
we
pass
from
the
true
to
the
probable
imitation
means
giving
the
impression
of
truth
that
is
done
by
selecting
a
few
of
its
features
only
and
this
is
the
procedure
in
which
the
probable
just
consists
if
you
wish
to
describe
the
rainbow
poetically
a
great
part
of
the
newtonian
optics
must
be
thrown
overboard
thus
many
circumstances
of
mathematical
demonstration
will
be
neglected
in
poetical
descriptions
and
the
rest
which
is
utilized
will
form
the
probable
or
that
particular
which
awakens
the
universal
idea
slumbering
in
the
minds
of
the
learned
the
great
art
of
poetry
consists
in
selection
of
the
image
containing
the
greatest
number
of
points
of
universal
doctrine
which
by
being
inserted
in
the
example
may
so
colour
the
precept
that
i
may
find
it
without
seeking
it
or
recognize
it
through
its
connexion
with
events
described
hence
poetry
can
not
be
content
with
imitation
allegory
too
is
needed
in
ancient
poetry
one
thing
is
read
and
another
is
meant
here
follows
the
inevitable
instance
of
the
homeric
poems
in
which
conti
certainly
finds
elements
which
can
not
be
reduced
to
instruction
and
allegory
and
therefore
to
some
extent
deserve
the
platonic
condemnation
he
recognizes
a
species
of
imagination
differing
from
passive
sensibility
which
father
malebranche
calls
active
imagination

use

not
to
use
at
a
given
time

place
the
rules
and
licences
of
art
and
to
control
the
extravagance
of
his
imagery
on
the
question
of
literary
taste
he
follows
the
opinion
of
trevisano
and
decides
that
it
consists
in
setting
in
mutual
harmony
that
is
to
say
restraining
within
limits

cognitive
faculties

of
his
numerous
works

in
a
little
tract
on
the

principles

who
was
more
tenderly
inclined

ardent
in
her
defence
against
those
who
denied
both
her
possibility
and
her
utility
and
against
those
who
admitted
these
yet
complained
not
unreasonably
that
she
was
substantially
the
same
as
that
which
in
former
days
had
been
treated
as
poetics
and
rhetoric
he
parried
this
accusation
of
which
he
recognized
the
partial
truth
by
asserting
that
it
was
impossible
for
one
writer
to
have
perfect
knowledge
of
all
the
arts
another
of
his
excuses
was
to
the
effect
that
æsthetic
was
a
science
too
young
to
show
the
perfection
reached
by
other
sciences
after
the
cultivation
of
centuries
in
one
place
he
says
he
has
no
intention
of
arguing
with
those
enemies
of
æsthetic
who
will
not
or
can
not
see
the
true
nature
and
aim
of
this
science
but
have
built
for
themselves
in
its
place
a
deformed
and
miserable
image
against
which
when
they
fight
they
fight
against
themselves
with
philosophic
resignation
he
concludes
that
the
same
fate
is
in
store
for
æsthetic
as
for
every
science
at
first
when
almost
unknown
they
encounter
enemies
and
detractors
who
ridicule
them
through
ignorance
and
prejudice
but
later
they
meet
persons
of
intellect
who
by
working
at
them
conjointly
carry
them
on
to
their
proper
perfection

and
there
can
be
the
seat
of
that
amorous
attraction
which
subdues
the
heart
that
is
described
as
æsthetically
false
whose
truth
the
inferior
faculty
is
unable
to
grasp
for
example
the
theory
that
bodies
are
composed
of
monads
once
they
have
become
intelligible
to
these
faculties
general
concepts
possess
great
æsthetic
richness
since
they
include
infinite
consequences
and
particular
cases
æsthetic
also
comprehends
those
things
which
can
not
be
thought
distinctly
or
if
so
thought
might
be
capable
of
upsetting
philosophic
gravity
a
kiss
may
be
an
excellent
subject
for
a
poet
but
whatever
would
be
thought
of
a
philosopher
who
sought
to
demonstrate
its
necessity
by
the
mathematical
method
moreover
meier
includes
the
whole
theory
of
observation
and
experiment
in
æsthetic
to
which
this
theory
belongs
he
says
by
right
of
its
connexion
with
the
senses
and
also
the
whole
theory
of
the
appetitive
faculties
because
æsthetic
requires
not
only
a
fine
wit
but
a
noble
heart
as
well
he
comes
near
truth
sometimes
when
for
example
he
observes
that
the
logical
form
presupposes
the
æsthetic
and
that
our
first
concepts
are
sensitive
later
becoming
distinct
by
the
help
of
logic
and
when
he
condemns
allegory
as
among
the
most
decadent
forms
of
beautiful
thinking
but
on
the
other
hand
he
thinks
that
logical
distinctions
and
definitions
although
not
necessarily
sought
after
by
genius
are
very
useful
in
poetry
they
are
even
indispensable
as
regulators
of
beautiful
thinking
and
make
up
as
it
were
the
skeleton
of
the
body
poetic
great
care
however
must
be
taken
not
to
judge
æsthetical
general
concepts
æstheticæ
universales
with
the
rigorous
exactitude
demanded
by
philosophical
and
since
such
concepts
taken
singly
may
be
likened
to
unstrung
jewels
they
must
be
connected
by
the
string
of
æsthetic
judgement
and
syllogism
the
theory
of
which
is
identical
with
that
presented
by
logic
setting
aside
that
part
which
is
of
little
or
no
use
to
genius
but
belongs
exclusively
to
the
philosopher
in
his
of
meier
having
combated
the
principle
of
imitation
which
appeared
to
him
at
once
too
broad
since
science
and
morals
are
also
imitations
of
nature
and
too
narrow
since
art
does
not
imitate
natural
objects
solely
nor
should
it
imitate
them
all
for
the
immoral
must
be
excluded
reaffirmed
the
thesis
that
the
æsthetic
principle
consists
in
the
greatest
possible
beauty
of
he
upheld
this
by
condemning
as
erroneous
the
belief
that
this
is
wholly
sensuous
and
confused
without
any
gleam
of
distinctness
or
rationality
the
perception
of
sweet
bitter
red
is
wholly
sensuous
but
there
is
another
perception
which
is
both
sensuous
and
intellectual
confused
and
distinct
in
which
both
faculties
the
higher
and
the
lower
collaborate
when
intellectuality
prevails
in
this
consciousness
then
we
have
science
when
sensibility
then
we
have
poetry
from
our
explanation
it
will
be
gathered
that
the
inferior
cognitive
faculties
must
collect
all
the
material
of
a
poem
and
all
its
parts
intellect
and
judgement
on
the
other
hand
watch
and
ensure
that
these
materials
are
placed
side
by
side
in
such
a
way
that
in
their
connexion
distinction
and
order
may
be
observed
here
a
plunge
into
sensationalism
there
a
fugitive
glimpse
of
truth
most
often
and
in
conclusion
an
adherence
to
the
old
mechanical
ornamental
pedagogic
theory
of
poetry
this
is
the
impression
left
on
us
by
the
æsthetic
writings
of
meier
sidenote
mendelssohn
and
other
followers
of
baumgarten
vogue
of
another
disciple
of
baumgarten
mendelssohn
conceiving
beauty
as
indistinct
image
of
a
perfection
deduced
that
god
can
have
no
perception
of
beauty
as
this
is
merely
a
phenomenon
of
human
imperfection
according
to
him
a
primary
form
of
pleasure
is
that
of
the
senses
arising
from
the
bettered
state
of
our
bodily
constitution
a
secondary
form
is
the
æsthetic
fact
of
sensible
beauty
that
is
to
say
unity
in
variety
a
third
form
is
perfection
or
harmony
in
variety
he
too
repudiates
hutcheson
ex
machina
the
sense
of
beauty
sensible
beauty
perfection
such
as
can
be
apprehended
by
the
senses
is
independent
of
the
fact
that
the
object
represented
is
beautiful
or
ugly
good
or
bad
by
nature
it
suffices
that
it
leaves
us
not
indifferent
whence
mendelssohn
agrees
with
baumgarten
definition
a
poem
is
a
discourse
sensibly
perfect
elias
schlegel

art
as
imitation
not
so
servile
as
to
seem
a
copy
but
having
similarity
rather
than
identity
with

first
to

and
only
afterwards
to

not

recognize
that

has
produced
more
literature
on

than

ourselves
to
bare
mention
of
the
works
of
riedel

schubart
westenrieder
szerdahel
könig
gang
meiners
schott
moritz
we
will
select
from
the
crowd
the
of
fine
arts
and
of
johann
august
eberhard
successor
to
meier
in
the
chair
at
halle
and
the
of
a
theory
and
literature
of
by
johann
joachim
eschenburg
one
of
the
most
popular
books
of
the
day
for
students
both
these
authors
are
followers
of
baumgarten
with
inclinations
towards
sensationalism
amongst
other
things
eberhard
considered
the
beautiful
as
that
which
pleases
the
most
distinct
senses
that
is
to
say
of
sight
and
hearing
sidenote
a
word
must
be
accorded
to
sulzer
in
whom
we
find
the
most
curious
alternation
of
new
and
old
the
romantic
influence
of
the
new
swiss
school
and
the
utilitarianism
and
intellectualism
of
his
day
he
asserts
that
beauty
exists
wherever
unity
variety
and
order
are
found
the
work
of
an
artist
is
strictly
in
the
form
in
lively
expression
the
material
is
irrelevant
to
art
but
the
duty
of
every
reasonable
and
sensible
man
is
to
make
judicious
selection
the
beauty
which
is
used
to
clothe
the
good
as
well
as
the
bad
is
not
the
ineffable
celestial
beauty
offspring
of
the
alliance
between
the
beautiful
the
good
and
the
perfect
which
awakens
more
than
mere
pleasure
a
veritable
joy
which
ravishes
and
beatifies
our
soul
such
is
the
human
face
when
by
filling
the
eye
of
the
beholder
with
the
pleasure
of
form
arising
from
the
variety
proportion
and
order
of
the
features
it
proceeds
to
arouse
the
imagination
and
intellect
by
its
suggestion
of
interior
perfection
of
the
same
nature
is
the
statue
of
a
great
man
carved
by
phidias
or
a
patriotic
oration
by
cicero
if
truth
lie
outside
art
and
belong
to
philosophy
the
most
noble
use
to
which
art
may
be
put
is
to
make
us
feel
the
important
truths
which
lend
her
strength
and
energy
not
to
mention
that
truth
itself
enters
into
art
in
the
shape
of
truthful
imitation
or
representation
sulzer
also
repeats
and
he
is
not
the
last
that
orators
historians
and
poets
are
intermediaries
between
speculative
philosophy
and
the
people
sidenote
karl
heinrich
heydenreich
returns
to
a
sounder
tradition
when
he
defines
art
as
a
representation
of
a
determinate
state
of
sensibility
and
observes
that
man
as
a
cognitive
being
is
impelled
to
enlarge
the
sphere
of
his
cognitions
and
impart
his
discoveries
to
his
fellows
while
as
a
sensitive
being
he
is
impelled
to
represent
and
communicate
his
sensations
whence
arise
science
and
art
but
heydenreich
does
not
clearly
grasp
the
cognitive
character
of
art
for
in
his
opinion
sensations
become
objects
of
artistic
representation
either
because
they
are
pleasing
or
when
not
pleasing
because
they
are
useful
to
further
the
moral
aims
of
man
as
a
social
being
the
objects
of
sensibility
which
enter
into
art
must
be
possessed
of
intrinsic
excellence
and
value
and
bear
reference
not
to
a
single
individual
but
to
the
individual
as
a
rational
being
hence
the
objectivity
and
necessity
of
taste
like
baumgarten
and
meier
he
divides
æsthetic
into
three
parts
a
doctrine
of
another
of
a

sidenote
g
herder
another
disciple
of
baumgarten
is
herder
who
had
an
unbounded
admiration
for
the
old
berlin
master
whom
he
calls
the
aristotle
of
his
day
and
defends
him
warmly
against
those
who
think
fit
to
describe
him
as
a
stupid
and
obtuse
syllogizer
on
the
other
hand
he
had
slight
esteem
for
subsequent
æsthetic
for
example
meier
work
which
he
stigmatized
accurately
enough
as
in
part
a
of
logic
in
part
a
patchwork
of
metaphorical
terms
comparisons
and
examples
o
æsthetic
he
cries
with
emphasis
o
æsthetic
the
most
fertile
the
most
beautiful
and
by
far
the
most
novel
of
all
abstract
sciences
in
what
cavern
of
the
muses
is
sleeping
the
youth
of
my
philosophic
nation
destined
to
bring
thee
to
perfection
he
denied
baumgarten
claim
to
have
established
an
pulchre
instead
of
limiting
himself
to
a
simple
de
pulchro
et
pulchris
philosophice
cogitans
and
ridiculed
the
scruple
which
held
æsthetic
to
be
unworthy
of
the
dignity
of
philosophy
to
compensate
for
this
however
he
accepted
the
fundamental
definition
cf
poetry
as
sensitiva
gem
of
definitions
says
he
the
best
that
has
ever
been
invented
that
penetrates
to
the
heart
of
the
matter
touches
the
true
poetic
principles
and
opens
the
most
extended
view
over
the
entire
philosophy
of
the
beautiful
coupling
poetry
with
her
sisters
the
fine
arts
like
cesarotti
the
italian
but
with
much
less
vivacity
and
brilliance
herder
the
german
had
studied
primitive
poetry
ossian
and
the
songs
of
ancient
peoples
shakespeare
popular
the
spirit
of
hebrew
poetry
and
oriental
poetry
these
studies
powerfully
impressed
upon
his
mind
the
sensitive
nature
of
poetry
his
friend
hamann
had
written
these
memorable
words
which
read
like
an
extract
from
one
of
vico
aphorisms
poetry
is
the
of
mankind
in
the
same
way
that
the
garden
is
older
than
the
ploughed
field
painting
than
writing
song
than
declamation
barter
than
trade
the
repose
of
our
most
ancient
progenitors
was
a
slumber
deeper
than
ours
their
motion
a
tumultuous
dance
they
spent
seven
days
in
the
silence
of
thought
or
of
stupor
and
opened
their
mouths
to
pronounce
winged
words
their
speech
was
sensation
and
passion
and
they
understood
nothing
but
images
of
images
is
composed
all
the
treasure
of
human
knowledge
and
felicity
although
herder
who
knew
and
admired
vico
does
not
mention
him
by
name
when
treating
of
language
and
poetry
one
might
suppose
him
to
be
influenced
by
the
great
neapolitan
at
least
in
the
final
consolidation
of
his
theories
but
on
the
contrary
the
authors
whom
he
chiefly
quotes
in
this
connexion
are
du
bos
goguet
and
condillac
and
observes
the
first
beginnings
of
human
speech
in
tone
gesture
expression
of
sensations
and
thoughts
by
means
of
images
and
signs
can
only
have
been
a
kind
of
crude
poetry
and
so
it
is
among
every
savage
nation
in
the
world
not
a
speech
with
punctuation
and
a
sense
of
syllable
like
ours
learning
as
we
do
to
read
and
write
but
an
unsyllabled
melody
which
gave
birth
to
the
primitive
epic
natural
man
depicts
what
he
sees
and
as
he
sees
it
alive
powerful
monstrous
in
order
or
disorder
as
he
sees
and
hears
so
he
reproduces
not
alone
did
barbarous
tongues
thus
arrange
their
images
but
greek
and
latin
do
the
same
as
the
senses
offered
material
so
the
poets
utilized
it
especially
in
homer
we
see
how
closely
nature
is
followed
in
images
which
glow
and
fade
perpetually
and
inimitably
he
describes
things
and
events
line
by
line
scene
by
scene
and
in
the
same
way
he
paints
men
in
their
very
bodies
actually
as
they
speak
and
move
later
we
distinguish
epic
from
what
we
call
history
because
the
former
not
only
describes
what
has
happened
but
describes
the
event
in
its
entirety
showing
how
it
occurred
in
the
only
possible
way
having
regard
to
surrounding
circumstance
of
body
and
spirit
this
is
the
reason
of
the
more
philosophical
character
of
poetry
as
for
pleasure
no
doubt
we
do
find
poetry
pleasant
but
the
idea
that
the
motive
is
merely
to
excite
pleasure
can
not
be
condemned
too
strongly
homer
gods
were
as
essential
and
indispensable
to
the
poet
world
as
the
forces
of
motion
are
to
the
world
of
matter
without
the
deliberations
and
activities
of
olympus
none
of
the
necessary
events
which
happen
on
this
earth
could
take
place
homer
magic
island
in
the
western
sea
belongs
to
the
map
of
his
hero
wanderings
by
the
same
necessity
which
placed
it
on
the
map
of
the
world
it
was
necessary
to
the
plan
of
his
poem
it
is
the
same
with
the
severe
dante
and
his
circles
of
hell
and
heaven
art
is
formative
she
disciplines
orders
and
governs
the
imagination
and
every
faculty
of
man
not
only
did
she
generate
history
but
earlier
yet
she
created
gods
and
heroes
and
purified
the
uncouth
imaginations
and
fables
of
peoples
with
their
titans
monsters
and
gorgons
reducing
to
limit
and
law
the
riotous
imagination
of
ignorant
men
which
knows
no
bounds
or
rule
notwithstanding
these
intuitions
so
like
those
of
vico
early
in
the
same
century
herder
as
a
philosopher
is
inferior
to
his
italian
predecessor
and
in
point
of
fact
does
not
rise
superior
to
baumgarten
by
application
of
leibniz
law
of
continuity
he
too
arrived
at
the
opinion
that
the
pleasing
the
true
the
beautiful
and
the
good
are
degrees
of
one
single
activity
for
instance
sensible
pleasure
is
a
participation
in
the
true
and
the
good
so
far
as
the
senses
may
comprehend
them
the
feeling
of
pleasure
and
pain
is
no
other
than
the
feeling
of
the
true
and
the
good
that
is
to
say
the
consciousness
that
the
aim
of
our
organism
the
conservation
of
our
and
the
avoidance
of
our
hurt

been
attained

disapproved
of
the
facile
theorists
of

who
began
straight
away
with
a
definition
of
beauty
a
complex
and
involved
concept
he
held
that
the
theory
of
fine
arts
should
be
subdivided
into
three
theories
each
to
be
built
up
from
the
foundations
the
theory
of

of

of
touch
that
is
to

of

the
barbarous

nothing
beyond
a
section
of
logic
that
which
we
call
taste
is
neither
more
nor

than
a
quick
and
rapid
judgement
which
does
not
exclude
truth
and
profundity

rather
presupposes

the

philosophy
is
not

a

the
mother
of

only

her

our
gratitude
for
having
brought
a
current
of
fresh
air
into
the
study
of
the
philosophy
of
language
the
lead
given
by
the
authors
had
been
followed
since
the
beginning
of
the
century
by
many
writers
of
logical
or
general
grammars
according
to
the
french
encyclopædia

of
grammarians
of

and
grammarians
of

assigning
to
the
former
the
duty
of
studying
the

general
grammars
had
been
written
by
du

many
others

what
was
the

and
particular
grammars
if
logic
be
one
how
comes
it
that
languages
are
many
is
the

a

and
by
others
who
had
some
slight
acquaintance
with
vico
but
profited
little
by
it
none
of
the
writers
was
able
to
free
himself
of
the
notion
that
speech
was
either
natural
and
mechanical
or
else
a
symbol
attached
to
thought
whereas
in
fact
it
was
impossible
to
solve
the
difficulties
under
which
they
were
labouring
except
by
dropping
the
notion
of
a
sign
or
symbol
and
attaining
the
conception
of
the
active
and
expressive
imagination
verbal
imagination
language
as
the
expression
not
of
intellect
but
of
intuition
an
approach
towards
this
explanation
was
made
by
herder
in
a
brilliant
and
imaginative
thesis
in
upon
this
subject
of
the
origin
of
language
chosen
for
discussion
by
the
berlin
academy
in
it
he
says
that
language
is
the
reflexion
or
consciousness
of
man
man
shows
reflexion
when
he
puts
forth
freely
such
force
of
mind
as
enables
him
to
make
selection
from
amongst
the
crowd
of
sensations
by
which
he
is
assailed
from
the
ocean
of
the
senses
so
to
speak
to
select
a
single
wave
and
consciously
to
watch
it
he
shows
reflexion
when
amidst
the
thronging
chaos
of
images
which
pass
before
him
as
in
a
dream
he
can
in
a
waking
moment
collect
himself
and
fasten
his
attention
upon
a
single
image
examine
it
calmly
and
clearly
and
separate
it
from
its
neighbours
once
again
man
shows
reflexion
when
he
is
able
not
merely
to
grasp
vividly
and
clearly
all
the
properties
of
an
image
but
also
to
recognize
one
or
more
of
its
distinctive
properties
the
language
of
man
does
not
depend
on
the
organization
of
the
mouth
for
even
he
who
is
dumb
from
birth
has
if
he
reflects
a
language
it
is
not
a
cry
of
the
senses
since
it
resides
in
a
reflective
creature
not
in
a
breathing
machine
it
is
not
an
affair
of
imitation
since
imitation
of
nature
is
a
means
and
we
are
here
trying
to
explain
the
end
much
less
is
it
an
arbitrary
convention
a
savage
in
the
depths
of
the
forest
would
have
had
to
create
a
language
for
himself
even
though
he
never
used
it
language
is
an
understanding
of
the
soul
with
herself
necessary
just
in
so
far
as
man
is
man
here
language
begins
to
show
itself
no
longer
as
purely
mechanical
or
as
something
derived
from
arbitrary
choice
and
invention
but
as
a
creative
activity
and
a
primary
affirmation
of
the
activity
of
the
human
mind
herder
essay
may
not
state
such
a
view
unequivocally
but
it
points
forward
to
such
a
conclusion
in
a
striking
way
for
which
its
author
has
not
received
the
credit
he
deserves
hamann
in
reviewing
his
friend
theories
agreed
with
him
in
denying
the
origin
of
language
by
invention
or
arbitrary
choice
while
dwelling
also
on
the
liberty
of
man
he
regarded
language
as
something
which
man
could
only
have
learned
by
means
of
a
mystical
from
god
that
too
was
one
way
of
recognizing
that
the
mystery
of
language
is
not
to
be
solved
except
by
placing
it
in
the
forefront
of
the
problem
of
the

a
great
medley
of
heterogeneous
ideas
is
noticeable
among
other
writers
on
æsthetic
during
the
same
period
in
appeared
a
little
volume
by
abbé
batteux
bearing
the
attractive
title
of
fine
arts
reduced
to
a
single
principle
in
which
the
author
attempted
a
unification
of
all
the
different
rules
laid
down
by
the
writers
of
treatises
all
such
rules
says
batteux
are
branches
emerging
from
one
trunk
he
who
possesses
the
simple
principle
will
be
able
to
deduce
the
rules
one
by
one
without
entangling
himself
in
their
mass
which
can
but
involve
him
in
endless
coils
the
author
had
passed
in
review
the
of
horace
and
that
of
boileau
and
the
works
of
rollin
dacier
le
bossu
and
but
had
found
real
help
only
in
aristotle
principle
of
imitation
which
he
thought
could
be
easily
and
strikingly
applied
to
poetry
painting
music
and
the
art
of
gesture
but
suddenly
the
aristotelian
principle
of
imitation
yields
place
to
a
wholly
new
rendering
namely
the
imitation
of
natural
the
business
of
art
is
to
select
the
most
beautiful
parts
of
nature
in
order
to
frame
them
into
an
exquisite
whole
which
shall
be
more
beautiful
than
nature
self
without
ceasing
to
be
natural
now
what
may
this
greater
perfection
this
beautiful
nature
be
on
one
occasion
batteux
identifies
it
with
truth
but
with
the
truth
which
may
be
with
which
is
represented
as
though
it
really
existed
with
all
the
perfections
it
could
possibly
receive
recalling
one
example
from
the
ancients
in
the
helen
of
zeuxis
and
one
from
the
moderns
in
the
of
molière
in
another
place
he
explains
that
beautiful
nature
tum
ipsius
obiecti
naturæ
tum
nostræ
convenit
that
it
has
the
closest
connexion
with
our
own
perfection
our
advantage
and
our
interest
and
is
at
the
same
time
perfect
in
itself
the
aim
of
imitation
is
to
please
to
move
to
soften
in
one
word
to
delight
so
beautiful
nature
must
be
interesting
and
furnished
with
unity
variety
symmetry
and
proportion
embarrassed
by
the
question
of
artistic
imitation
of
things
naturally
ugly
or
objectionable
batteux
falls
back
on
saying
as
castelvetro
had
said
before
him
that
displeasing
objects
please
when
imitated
since
imitation
being
always
imperfect
in
comparison
with
the
reality
can
not
excite
the
horror
and
disgust
aroused
by
the
latter
from
pleasure
he
deduces
the
other
aim
of
utility
if
the
aim
of
poetry
be
to
give
pleasure
and
pleasure
by
moving
the
passions
then
in
order
to
give
a
perfect
and
enduring
pleasure
it
ought
to
rouse
such
passions
only
as
it
is
well
to
excite
not
those
inimical
to
goodness
sidenote
english
it
is
difficult
to
string
together
a
more
insubstantial
mass
of
contradictions
but
batteux
is
rivalled
and
outdone
by
the
english
philosophers
or
rather
scribblers
on
æsthetic
or
rather
on
things
in
general
which
sometimes
accidentally
include
æsthetic
facts
happening
to
find
in
lomazzo
some
words
attributed
to
michæl
angelo
on
the
beauty
of
shapes
hogarth
the
artist
took
into
his
head
the
idea
that
the
figurative
arts
can
be
regulated
by
a
special
principle
which
can
be
expressed
in
a
particular
fine
filled
with
this
discovery
in
he
designed
a
frontispiece
for
a
volume
of
his
engravings
it
depicted
a
painter
palette
scored
across
with
an
undulating
line
and
the
words
line
of
public
curiosity
was
immediately
aroused
by
this
hieroglyphic
to
be
satisfied
a
little
later
by
the
publication
of
his
book
analysis
of
in
this
he
combated
the
mistake
of
judging
pictures
either
by
the
subject
or
the
excellence
of
the
imitation
instead
of
by
their
form
which
is
the
true
essential
of
art
and
is
composed
of
symmetry
variety
uniformity
simplicity
intricacy
and
quantity
all
things
which
in
the
production
of
beauty
correcting
and
restraining
each
other
as
required
but
immediately
afterwards
hogarth
proclaims
that
there
must
also
be
correspondence
and
agreement
with
the
thing
copied
for
regularity
uniformity
and
symmetry
give
pleasure
in
so
far
only
as
they
serve
to
give
the
illusion
of
faithful
correspondence
further
on
the
reader
learns
that
amongst
the
immense
variety
of
undulating
lines
which
may
be
conceived
there
is
but
one
which
truly
merits
the
name
of
the
line
of
beauty
and
this
is
a
precisely
serpentine
line
which
may
be
called
the
line
of
grace
again
we
are
told
that
intricacy
of
lines
is
beautiful
because
the
active
mind
likes
to
be
engaged
and
the
eye
delights
in
being
guided
in
a
sort
of
hunt
a
straight
line
has
no
beauty
and
the
pig
the
bear
the
spider
and
the
toad
are
ugly
because
devoid
of
undulating
lines
the
ancients
showed
much
judgement
in
the
management
and
grouping
of
lines
varying
from
the
precise
line
of
grace
only
on
those
occasions
when
the
character
or
action
demanded
sidenote

similar
indecision
edmund
burke
wavers
between
the
principle
of
imitation
and
other
heterogeneous
or
imaginary
principles

his
book

into
the
origin
of
our
ideas
of
the
sublime
and
the
he
observes
natural
properties
contained
in
an
object

pleasure
or
displeasure
to
the
imagination
beyond
this
however
imagination
may
delight
in
the
likeness
of
a
copy
to
its
original
he
asserts
that
from
these
two
reasons
arises
the
whole
pleasure
of
imagination
without
dwelling
further
on
the
second
he
proceeds
to
a
lengthy
discussion
of
the
natural
qualities
which
should
be
found
in
an
object
of
sensible
beauty
firstly
comparative
smallness

these
are

to
this

in
so

as
unaccompanied

these
that
the
pleasures
of
beauty
are
derived
beauty
is
divided
into
beauty
of
relation
and
intrinsic
beauty
of
the
latter
only
account
is
that
regularity
simplicity
uniformity
proportion
order
and
other
pleasing
qualities
have
been
so
disposed
by
the
author
of
nature
in
order
to
increase
our
happiness
here
on
earth
which
as
is
clearly
shown
in
numberless
instances
is
not
foreign
to
his
care
this
notion
is
confirmed
when
he
reflects
that
our
taste
for
such
details
is
not
accidental
but
uniform
and
universal
being
a
very
part
of
our
nature
adding
that
regularity
uniformity
order
and
simplicity
help
to
facilitate
perception
and
make
it
possible
for
us
to
form
clearer
conception
of
objects
than
it
would
be
possible
to
gain
by
the
most
earnest
attention
were
such
qualities
not
present
proportions
are
often
combined
with
a
view
to
utility
as
we
see
that
the
best
proportioned
amongst
animals
are
also
the
strongest
but
there
are
also
many
examples
in
which
this
conjunction
does
not
hold
good
wherefore
the
wisest
plan
is
to
rest
content
with
the
final
cause
just
mentioned
that
of
the
increase
of
our
happiness
intended
by
the
author
of
nature
in
his
on
and
on
alexander
gérard
employs
by
turns
according
to
the
various
forms
of
art
the
principles
of
association
of
direct
pleasure
of
expression
and
even
of
moral
sense
the
same
kind
of
explanation
reappears
in
another
on
by
alison
sidenote
and
sensationalism
it
is
impossible
to
classify
works
of
such
calibre
almost
wholly
lacking
as
they
are
in
scientific
method
on
each
page
their
writers
pass
from
physiological
sensationalism
to
moralism
from
the
imitation
of
nature
to
mysticism
and
transcendent
finalism
without
the
slightest
sense
of
incongruity
it
would
be
absurd
to
take
them
seriously
in
comparison
it
is
almost
refreshing
to
come
across
a
frank
hedonist
in
the
german
ernst
plainer
who
interpreted
hogarth
inquiry
into
lines
after
a
fashion
of
his
own
and
was
unable
to
see
anything
in
æsthetic
facts
except
a
reverberation
of
sexual
pleasure
where
can
we
find
a
beauty
he
asks
that
is
not
derived
from
the
female
figure
the
centre
of
all
beauty
undulating
lines
are
beautiful
because
found
in
a
woman
body
beautiful
are
all
movements
distinctively
feminine
beautiful
the
tones
of
music
melting
one
into
another
beautiful
the
poem
where
one
thought
embraces
another
with
tenderness
and
facility
condillac
sensationalism
had
already
shown
itself
wholly
incapable
of
understanding
æsthetic
productivity
the
associationism
especially
promoted
by
the
work
of
hume
fared
no
better
sidenote
the
dutchman
hemsterhuis
considered
beauty
as
a
phenomenon
born
of
the
meeting
between
sensibility
which
gives
multiplicity
and
the
internal
sense
which
tends
to
unity
hence
the
beautiful
is
that
which
exhibits
the
greatest
number
of
ideas
in
the
shortest
time
man
to
whom
it
is
not
permitted
to
attain
ultimate
unity
finds
in
beauty
an
approximate
unity
which
gives
him
a
pleasure
somewhat
analogous
with
the
joy
of
love
this
theory
of
hemsterhuis
in
which
elements
of
mysticism
and
sensationalism
mingle
with
glimpses
of
truth
developed
later
into
the
sentimentalism
of
jacobi
for
whom
the
totality
of
truth
and
goodness
and
even
the
supersensible
itself
are
sensibly
present
to
the
soul
in
the
form
of
beauty
sidenote
and
mysticism
platonism
or
more
accurately
was
revived
by
the
creator
of
the
history
of
figurative
art
winckelmann
contemplation
of
the
masterpieces
of
antique
plastic
art
and
the
impression
of
superhuman
loftiness
and
divine
indifference
which
they
create
all
the
more
irresistibly
because
we
can
not
reawaken
the
life
they
once
possessed
or
understand
their
real
significance
led
winckelmann
and
others
with
him
to
the
conception
of
a
beauty
which
descending
from
the
seventh
heaven
of
the
divine
idea
embodied
itself
in
works
of
this
description
baumgarten
follower
mendelssohn
had
denied
the
enjoyment
of
beauty
to
god
the
winckelmann
gave
it
back
to
him
and
lodged
it
in
his
bosom
sidenote
and
lack
of
wise
men
who
have
meditated
upon
the
causes
of
universal
beauty
seeking
her
amongst
created
things
and
trying
to
gain
the
contemplation
of
supreme
beauty
have
placed
it
in
the
perfect
harmony
of
creatures
with
their
ends
and
of
their
parts
with
one
another
but
as
this
is
equivalent
to
perfection
which
man
is
incapable
of
attaining
our
concept
of
universal
beauty
remains
indeterminate
and
arises
by
means
of
particular
cognitions
which
when
accurately
collected
and
fitted
together
give
us
the
highest
idea
we
can
attain
of
human
beauty
which
we
elevate
in
proportion
as
we
raise
it
above
matter
but
again
since
the
creator
deals
out
perfection
to
all
his
creatures
in
the
proportion
that
befits
them
and
since
every
concept
rests
on
some
cause
which
must
be
sought
outside
the
concept
itself
the
cause
of
beauty
which
is
to
be
found
in
every
created
thing
can
not
be
sought
in
anything
outside
these
created
things
for
this
reason
and
because
our
cognitions
are
comparative
concepts
whereas
beauty
can
not
be
compared
with
anything
higher
it
is
difficult
to
attain
a
distinct
and
universal
cognition
of
beauty
the
only
way
out
of
this
difficulty
and
others
like
it
is
the
recognition
that
supreme
beauty
resides
in
god
the
concept
of
human
beauty
becomes
the
more
perfect
in
proportion
as
it
can
be
thought
more
in
conformity
and
agreement
with
supreme
being
which
is
distinguished
from
matter
by
its
own
unity
and
indivisibility
this
conception
of
beauty
is
as
a
spirit
which
freed
by
fire
from
the
prison
of
matter
strives
to
conjure
up
a
creature
in
the
likeness
of
the
first
reasonable
creature
formed
by
the
divine
intelligence
the
forms
of
such
an
image
are
simple
and
continuous
and
within
this
unity
they
are
varied
and
for
that
very
reason
harmonious
to
these
characteristics
is
added
lack
of
significance
since
supreme
beauty
can
not
be
described
with
points
or
fines
different
from
those
which
alone
can
constitute
that
beauty
its
form
is
not
peculiar
to
this
or
that
determinate
person
neither
does
it
express
any
state
of
feeling
or
sensation
of
passion
things
which
disturb
unity
and
overcloud
beauty
winckelmann
concludes
we
look
upon
beauty
as
a
purest
water
drawn
from
the
centre
of
the
spring
the
less
taste
it
has
the
higher
it
is
esteemed
because
free
from
all
impurities
to
perceive
pure
beauty
a
special
faculty
is
required
which
certainly
is
not
sense
but
may
perhaps
be
intellect
or
even
as
winckelmann
says
a
fine
internal
sense
free
from
all
intentions
or
passions
of
instinct
inclination
or
pleasure
having
asserted
beauty
to
be
something
supersensible
it
is
not
surprising
that
winckelmann
should
wish
if
not
wholly
to
exclude
colour
at
least
to
reduce
it
to
a
minimum
and
treat
it
not
as
a
constitutive
element
in
beauty
but
as
secondary
and
ancillary
true
beauty
is
given
in
form
by
which
he
means
line
and
surface
forgetting
that
these
are
only
apprehended
by
the
senses
and
could
not
be
seen
without
being
in
some
way
coloured
sidenote
contradictions
and
when
error
refuses
to
retire
to
the
narrow
cell
of
a
brief
aphorism
it
finds
itself
condemned
to
in
order
to
live
at
all
in
the
world
of
concrete
facts
and
problems
although
composed
with
a
view
to
stating
a
theory
the
work
of
winckelmann
always
led
him
among
concrete
historical
facts
clamouring
to
be
brought
into
relation
with
his
formally
stated
idea
of
supreme
beauty
in
his
admission
of
and
his
further
admission
on
a
lower
plane
of
colour
we
have
two
compromises
already
to
which
a
third
is
added
in
his
principle
of
expression
since
human
nature
has
no
state
intermediate
between
pain
and
pleasure
and
as
living
creature
without
such
feelings
is
inconceivable
the
human
figure
must
be
represented
in
a
condition
of
action
and
passion
which
artists
call
expression
hence
winckelmann
after
dealing
with
beauty
goes
on
to
treat
of
expression
he
then
found
himself
obliged
to
effect
a
fourth
compromise
between
the
single
constant
supreme
beauty
and
individual
beauties
for
while
he
preferred
the
male
to
the
female
body
as
a
completer
embodiment
of
perfect
beauty
he
could
not
shut
his
eyes
to
the
obvious
fact
that
we
know
and
admire
beautiful
women
bodies
and
even
beautiful
animals
bodies
sidenote
friend
and
in
a
sense
collaborator
of
winckelmann
was
raphæl
mengs
the
artist
no
less
eager
than
his
archæological
to
understand
the
nature
of
that
beauty
which
the
one
studied
as
a
critic
while
the
other
produced
it
as
a
painter
remarking
writes
mengs
that
of
the
two
chief
duties
of
a
painter
the
imitation
of
appearances
and
the
selection
of
the
most
beautiful
objects
much
has
been
written
on
the
former
while
the
latter
has
scarcely
been
touched
by
the
modems
who
would
have
been
ignorant
of
the
art
of
drawing
were
it
not
for
the
statues
of
ancient
greece
pondering
this
i
read
asked
and
looked
at
everything
likely
to
throw
light
on
the
subject
but
never
was
i
satisfied
either
they
spoke
of
beautiful
things
or
of
qualities
which
are
the
attributes
of
beauty
or
they
pretended
to
explain
as
the
saying
is
the
obscure
by
the
more
obscure
or
even
confused
the
beautiful
with
the
pleasing
so
that
finally
i
determined
to
search
for
the
nature
of
beauty
on
my
own
account
one
of
his
works
on
this
subject
was
published
during
his
lifetime
by
the
advice
and
assistance
of
winckelmann
many
others
appeared
posthumously
all
were
reprinted
several
times
and
translated
into
several
languages
in
his
of
he
says
i
have
been
sailing
a
long
time
on
a
vast
sea
seeking
the
understanding
of
beauty
and
still
i
am
far
from
any
shore
and
in
great
doubt
how
to
shape
my
course
gazing
around
my
sight
is
confounded
by
the
immensity
of
the
subject
in
truth
it
seems
as
though
mengs
never
arrived
at
a
formula
satisfactory
to
himself
although
he
conformed
more
or
less
to
winckelmann
doctrine
that
beauty
consists
in
material
perfection
according
to
our
ideas
and
since
god
alone
is
perfect
beauty
is
divine
it
is
the
visible
idea
of
perfection
and
stands
in
the
same
relation
to
it
as
does
a
visible
to
a
mathematical
point
our
ideas
proceed
from
the
purposes
which
the
creator
has
willed
to
fulfil
in
various
things
hence
the
multiplicity
of
beauties
in
general
mengs
finds
the
types
of
things
in
natural
species
a
stone
of
which
we
have
the
idea
that
it
should
be
uniform
in
colour
which
is
called
ugly
if
it
happen
to
be
spotted
or
a
child
would
be
ugly
if
he
were
like
a
man
of
mature
age
just
as
a
man
is
ugly
when
shaped
like
a
woman
and
a
woman
when
she
is
like
a
man
he
adds
surprisingly
as
among
stones
there
is
but
one
perfect
species
the
diamond
among
metals
gold
and
among
animated
creatures
man
only
so
there
is
difference
and
distinction
in
every
order
and
very
rarely
is
there
perfection
in
his
of
he
considers
beauty
as
a
middle
disposition
including
perfection
on
the
one
hand
and
the
pleasing
on
the
other
in
reality
it
is
a
third
thing
differing
from
perfection
and
the
pleasing
and
deserving
a
special
name
for
itself
the
art
of
painting
arises
from
four
sources
beauty
significant
or
expressive
character
the
pleasing
united
to
harmony
and
colouring
mengs
finds
the
first
amongst
the
ancients
the
second
in
raphæl
the
third
in
correggio
and
the
fourth
in
titian
from
this
empirical
he
rouses
himself
to
exclaim
the
force
of
beauty
so
transports
me
that
i
will
tell
thee
reader
what
i
feel
all
nature
is
beautiful
and
so
is
virtue
beautiful
are
forms
and
proportions
beautiful
are
appearances
and
beautiful
the
causes
thereof
more
beautiful
is
reason
most
beautiful
of
all
is
the
great
first
cause
sidenote
an
attenuated
that
is
to
say
a
less
metaphysical
echo
of
winckelmann
theory
is
found
in
lessing
who
infused
a
new
spirit
into
the
literature
and
social
life
of
the
germany
of
his
time
according
to
lessing
the
aim
of
art
is
delight
and
since
delight
is
a
superfluous
thing
it
seems
reasonable
that
the
legislator
should
not
allow
to
art
that
liberty
which
is
indispensable
to
science
in
her
search
for
truth
the
soul
necessity
for
the
greeks
painting
was
what
by
its
nature
it
ought
to
be
the
imitation
of
beautiful
bodies
its
hellenic
cultivator
represented
nothing
but
the
beautiful
common
beauty
of
a
low
grade
served
him
as
an
accidental
subject
an
exercise
a
diversion
the
attractiveness
of
his
work
must
depend
simply
and
solely
on
the
perfection
of
his
subject
he
was
far
too
true
an
artist
to
wish
his
audience
to
content
itself
with
the
barren
pleasure
arising
from
mere
resemblance
or
from
the
inspection
of
skilful
workmanship
nothing
in
his
art
was
dearer
to
him
nothing
seemed
more
noble
than
the
end
at
which
it
aimed
pictorial
representation
must
exclude
everything
unpleasing
or
ugly
painting
as
imitation
may
express
ugliness
painting
as
a
fine
art
will
refuse
to
do
so
all
visible
objects
belong
to
art
taken
under
the
former
title
the
latter
may
claim
only
such
objects
as
awaken
pleasing
sensations
if
on
the
contrary
ugliness
may
be
represented
by
the
poet
the
reason
is
this
poetic
description
conveys
a
less
displeasing
sense
of
bodily
malformation
which
in
the
end
almost
loses
its
character
as
such
unable
to
use
it
for
itself
the
poet
uses
it
as
a
means
to
provoke
certain
mixed
feelings
the
ridiculous
the
terrible
in
which
we
are
content
to
remain
in
the
absence
of
any
purely
pleasant
feelings
in
his
lessing
takes
his
stand
upon
the
aristotelian
it
is
well
known
that
not
only
did
he
approve
of
rules
in
general
but
he
believed
those
laid
down
by
aristotle
to
be
as
incontrovertible
as
the
theorems
of
euclid
his
polemic
against
french
writers
and
critics
is
waged
in
the
name
of
probability
not
to
be
confounded
with
historical
accuracy
he
understood
the
universal
as
a
sort
of
average
of
what
appears
in
individuals
and
catharsis
as
a
conversion
of
passions
into
virtuous
dispositions
asserting
it
as
beyond
doubt
that
the
aim
of
all
poetry
is
to
inspire
a
love
for
virtue
he
follows
the
example
of
winckelmann
in
introducing
the
concept
of
ideal
beauty
into
the
doctrine
of
figurative
art
expression
of
corporeal
beauty
is
the
aim
of
painting
therefore
supreme
beauty
of
body
is
the
supreme
aim
of
art
but
this
supreme
beauty
of
body
is
found
in
man
only
and
for
him
it
exists
only
through
the
ideal
this
ideal
may
be
found
among
the
brute
creation
in
inferior
degree
but
is
entirely
absent
from
vegetable
or
inanimate
nature
landscape
and
flower
painters
are
not
really
artists
because
they
imitate
beauties
possessed
of
no
ideal
whereby
they
work
by
eye
and
hand
alone
genius
having
little
or
no
part
in
their
compositions
nevertheless
lessing
prefers
a
landscape
painter
to
the
painter
of
historic
pieces
who
instead
of
making
beauty
his
aim
merely
depicts
a
crowd
in
order
to
show
his
cunning
in
simple
expression
not
in
expression
subordinate
to
beauty
the
ideal
of
bodily
beauty
then
consists
chiefly
in
the
ideal
of
form
but
also
in
that
of
texture
of
the
flesh
and
in
that
of
permanent
expression
mere
colouring
and
transitory
expression
have
no
ideal
since
nature
herself
has
placed
no
indelible
seal
upon
them
at
the
bottom
of
his
heart
lessing
dislikes
colour
and
when
he
finds
the
of
painters
showing
a
life
a
freedom
a
brilliancy
never
to
be
found
in
their
painted
pictures
he
asks
himself
whether
the
most
marvellous
colouring
can
compensate
so
heavy
a
loss
and
whether
it
is
not
to
be
wished
that
painting
in
oils
had
never
been
invented
sidenote
of
ideal
ideal
beauty
that
curious
alliance
between
god
and
the
subtle
outline
traced
with
pen
or
graver
that
cold
academical
mysticism

into
fashion
in
italy
the
home
of
winckelmann
and
mengs
who
published
many
of
their
works
in

it
was
much
discussed
by

connoisseurs

spalletti
and
the
the
first
voice
of
dissent
from
this
doctrine
of
ideal
beauty
was
raised
in
by
a
small
circle
of
italians
who
asserted
the
characteristic
to
be
the
principle
of
art
as
such
appears
to
be
the
necessary
interpretation
of
the
little
on
written
by
guiseppe
spalletti
in
the
form
of
a
letter
to
mengs
with
whom
spalletti
had
discussed
the
subject
in
the
solitudes
of
grottaferrata
and
who
had
urged
him
to
put
all
his
thoughts
in
writing
its
polemical
character
though
not
openly
asserted
is
discernible
in
every
page
truth
in
general
conscientiously
rendered
by
the
artist
is
the
object
of
beauty
in
general
when
the
soul
finds
those
characteristics
which
wholly
converge
upon
the
matter
which
the
work
of
art
claims
to
represent
it
judges
that
work
beautiful
the
same
is
true
of
the
works
of
nature
if
the
soul
perceives
a
man
of
fine
proportions
having
the
face
of
a
lovely
woman
which
causes
it
to
doubt
whether
the
object
before
it
be
man
or
woman
it
esteems
that
man
ugly
rather
than
the
reverse
through
deficiency
of
the
characteristic
of
truth
if
this
can
be
said
of
natural
beauty
how
much
more
can
it
be
said
of
the
beauty
of
art
the
pleasure
given
by
beauty
is
intellectual
that
is
to
say
it
is
the
pleasure
of
apprehending
truth
when
confronted
by
ugly
things
represented
characteristically
man
delights
in
having
increased
his
cognitions
beauty
with
its
property
of
supplying
to
the
soul
likeness
order
proportion
harmony
and
variety
provides
it
with
an
immense
field
for
the
construction
of
innumerable
syllogisms
and
by
reasoning
in
this
manner
it
will
take
pleasure
in
itself
in
the
object
which
arouses
such
pleasure
and
in
the
feeling
of
its
own
perfection
finally
the
beautiful
may
be
defined
as
the
inherent
modification
of
the
object
under
observation
which
presents
it
in
the
inevitably
characteristic
manner
in
which
it
is
bound
to
appear
in
contrast
to
the
fallacious
profundity
of
winckelmann
and
mengs
we
welcome
the
sound

sense
of

to
deny
the
view

from

ideal

and

side

with
the
ideal

to
find
an

this

and

the

of

genius
is
immanuel
kant
who
now
comes
before
us
in
his
turn
sidenote
and
that
kant
took
up
the
problem
of
philosophy
where
vico
laid
it
down
not
of
course
in
a
directly
historical
but
in
an
ideal
sense
has
already
been
noted
by
others
how
far
he
made
an
advance
upon
his
predecessor
and
how
far
he
failed
to
reach
the
same
level
it
is
not
here
our
business
to
inquire
we
must
confine
ourselves
strictly
to
the
consideration
of
æsthetic
questions
summarizing
the
results
of
such
a
consideration
we
may
say
at
once
that
though
kant
holds
an
immensely
important
place
in
the
development
of
german
thought
though
the
book
containing
his
examination
of
æsthetic
facts
is
among
his
most
influential
works
and
though
in
histories
of
æsthetic
written
from
the
german
point
of
view
which
ignore
practically
the
whole
development
of
european
thought
from
the
sixteenth
to
the
eighteenth
century
kant
can
pose
as
the
man
who
discovered
the
problem
of
æsthetic
or
solved
it
or
brought
it
within
sight
of
solution
yet
in
an
unprejudiced
and
complete
history
whose
aim
is
to
take
broad
views
and
to
consider
not
the
popularity
of
a
book
or
the
historical
importance
of
a
nation
but
the
intrinsic
value
of
ideas
the
judgement
passed
on
kant
must
be
very
different
like
vico
in
the
serious
tenacity
with
which
he
reflected
upon
æsthetic
facts
more
fortunate
than
he
in
having
a
much
larger
stock
of
material
gathered
from
preceding
discussion
and
argument
kant
was
at
once
unlike
and
less
successful
than
vico
in
that
he
was
unable
to
attain
a
doctrine
substantially
true
and
unable
also
to
give
his
thoughts
the
necessary
system
and
unity
sidenote
of
the
concept
of
art
in
kant
and
in
fact
what
was
kant
idea
of
art
strange
as
our
reply
may
seem
to
those
who
recollect
the
explicit
and
insistent
war
waged
by
him
against
the
school
of
wolff
and
the
concept
of
beauty
as
a
perfection
confusedly
perceived
we
must
assert
that
kant
idea
of
art
was
fundamentally
the
same
as
that
of
baumgarten
and
the
wolffian
school
in
that
school
his
mind
had
been
trained
he
always
had
a
great
respect
for
baumgarten
whom
in
the
of
pure
he
calls
that
excellent
analyst
he
chose
the
text
of
baumgarten
for
two
of
his
university
lectures
on
metaphysics
and
that
of
meier
for
his
lecture
on
logic
kant
like
them
therefore
considered
logic
and
æsthetic
or
theory
of
art
as
conjoined
sciences
they
were
thus
described
by
him
in
his
of
in
when
he
proposed
while
expounding
the
critique
of
reason
to
throw
a
glance
at
that
of
taste
that
is
to
say
at
æsthetic
since
the
rules
of
one
apply
to
the
other
and
each
throws
light
upon
the
other
sidenote
lectures
in
his
university
lectures
he
distinguished
æsthetic
truth
from
logical
truth
in
the
style
of
meier
even
citing
the
example
of
the
beautiful
rosy
face
of
a
girl
which
when
seen
distinctly
through
a
microscope
ceases
to
be
beautiful
it
is
æsthetically
true
said
he
that
a
man
once
dead
can
not
come
to
life
again
although
this
is
in
opposition
to
logic
and
moral
truth
it
is
æsthetically
true
that
the
sun
plunges
into
the
sea
but
it
is
false
logically
and
objectively
to
what
degree
it
is
necessary
to
combine
logical
truth
with
æsthetic
the
learned
have
never
yet
been
able
to
decide
not
even
the
greatest
æstheticians
in
order
to
become
accessible
logical
concepts
must
assume
æsthetic
forms
a
garb
to
be
abandoned
only
in
the
rational
sciences
which
seek
profundity
æsthetic
certainty
is
subjective
it
is
content
with
authority
the
citation
of
the
opinions
of
great
men
on
account
of
our
weakness
for
we
are
strongly
attached
to
the
sensible
æsthetic
perfection
often
helps
us
to
render
our
thoughts
distinct
in
this
examples
and
images
æsthetic
perfection
is
the
vehicle
for
logical
perfection
taste
is
the
analogue
of
intellect
there
are
logical
truths
which
are
not
æsthetic
truths
and
on
the
other
hand
we
must
exclude
from
abstract
philosophy
exclamations
and
other
sentimental
commotions
proper
to
the
other
truth
poetry
is
a
harmonious
play
of
thoughts
and
sensations
poetry
and
eloquence
differ
in
this
in
the
former
thoughts
adapt
themselves
to
sensations
in
the
latter
the
contrary
is
the
case
in
these
lectures
kant
sometimes
taught
that
poetry
is
anterior
to
eloquence
because
sensations
come
before
thoughts
and
he
observed
perhaps
under
herder
influence
that
the
poetry
of
eastern
peoples
lacking
concepts
is
wanting
in
unity
and
taste
although
rich
in
imaginative
detail
poetry
formed
out
of
the
pure
play
of
sensibility
is
doubtless
a
possibility
but
true
poetry
disdains
such
productions
concerned
as
they
are
with
sensations
which
every
one
knows
ought
to
be
expelled
from
our
breasts
true
poetry
must
strive
to
present
virtue
and
intellectual
truth
in
sensible
form
as
has
been
done
by
pope
in
his
on
man
in
which
he
attempts
to
vivify
poetry
by
means
of
reason
on
other
occasions
kant
definitely
says
that
logical
perfection
is
the
basis
of
every
other
æsthetic
perfection
being
merely
an
adornment
of
the
logical
something
of
the
latter
may
be
omitted
in
order
to
appeal
to
the
audience
but
it
must
never
be
disguised
or
falsified
this
is
baumgartenism
pure
and
simple
unless
we
are
prepared
to
look
on
these
lectures
as
representing
a
period
of
thought
or
an
exoteric
doctrine
superseded
eventually
by
kant
own
original
esoteric
ideas
in
his
of
the
not
to
open
such
a
controversy
let
us
put
these
lectures
on
one
side
although
they
often
throw
no
little
light
on
the
signification
of
kantian
phrases
and
formulæ
and
refuse
to
raise
the
question
what
pages
of
the
of
the
are
derived
from
baumgarten
and
meier
he
who
reads
the
works
of
these
disciples
of
wolff
and
passes
immediately
to
the
of
often
has
the
impression
that
the
atmosphere
surrounding
him
is
unchanged
but
if
the
of
itself
be
examined
without
prejudice
it
will
be
seen
that
kant
always
adhered
to
baumgarten
conception
of
art
as
the
sensible
and
imaginative
vesture
of
an
intellectual
concept
sidenote
in
the
critique
of
judgment
according
to
kant
art
is
not
pure
beauty
wholly
detached
from
the
concept
it
is
adherent
beauty
which
presupposes
and
attaches
itself
to
a
concept
this
is
the
work
of
genius
the
faculty
of
representing
æsthetic
ideas
an
æsthetic
idea
is
a
representation
of
the
imagination
which
accompanies
a
given
concept
a
representation
conjoined
with
such
truthful
representation
of
particulars
as
to
be
unable
to
find
for
it
any
expression
that
may
mark
a
determinate
concept
thereby
endowing
the
given
concept
with
something
of
the
ineffable
a
feeling
which
stimulates
the
cognitive
faculties
and
reinforcing
the
tongue
which
is
simply
the
letter
with
the
spirit
genius
then
has
two
constitutive
elements
imagination
and
intellect
it
consists
in
that
happy
disposition
which
no
science
can
teach
or
diligence
attain
to
find
ideas
for
a
given
concept
and
also
to
select
the
expression
by
which
the
subjective
commotion
it
excites
as
accompaniment
to
a
concept
may
be
communicated
to
others
no
concept
is
adequate
to
the
æsthetic
idea
as
no
representation
of
the
imagination
can
ever
possibly
be
adequate
to
the
concept
examples
of
æsthetic
attributes
are
found
in
the
eagle
of
jupiter
with
the
thunderbolt
in
its
claws
and
the
peacock
of
the
proud
queen
of
heaven
they
do
not
like
logical
attributes
represent
that
which
is
contained
in
our
concepts
of
the
sublimity
or
majesty
of
creation
but
something
else
which
gives
occasion
to
the
imagination
to
run
riot
over
a
multitude
of
kindred
representations
which
make
us
think
more
than
we
can
express
in
a
given
concept
by
means
of
words
and
give
us
an
æsthetic
idea
which
serves
to
this
rational
idea
instead
of
a
logical
representation
precisely
with
the
aim
of
quickening
our
feelings
by
throwing
open
to
them
a
view
over
a
vast
field
of
kindred
representations
there
are
a
and
a
of
expressing
our
thoughts
the
first
consists
in
following
determinate
principles
the
other
in
the
mere
feeling
of
the
unity
of
the
representation
to
imagination
to
intellect
and
to
spirit
we
must
add
taste
the
link
between
imagination
and
intellect
art
may
therefore
represent
natural
ugliness
artistic
beauty
is
not
a
beautiful
but
a
beautiful
representation
of
a
thing
although
the
representation
of
ugliness
has
limits
varying
with
the
individual
arts
a
reminiscence
of
lessing
and
winckelmann
and
an
absolute
limit
at
the
disgusting
and
nauseating
which
kill
representation
itself
in
natural
things
too
there
is
adherent
beauty
which
can
not
be
judged
by
the
æsthetic
judgement
alone
but
demands
a
concept
nature
thus
appears
as
a
work
of
art
though
superhuman
art
the
teleological
judgement
is
the
basis
and
condition
of
the
æsthetic
when
we
say
this
is
a
beautiful
woman
we
merely
mean
that
nature
beautifully
represents
in
the
form
of
this
woman
her
purpose
in
the
construction
of
the
female
body
it
is
necessary
therefore
besides
noting
simple
form
to
aim
at
a
concept
so
that
the
object
may
be
apprehended
through
an
æsthetic
judgement
logically
conditioned
by
this
means
is
formed
the
ideal
of
beauty
in
the
human
face
the
expression
of
moral
life
kant
admits
that
there
may
also
be
artistic
productions
without
a
concept
comparable
with
the
free
beauties
of
nature
flowers
and
some
birds
parrot
bird
of
paradise
etc
ornamental
drawings
musical
fantasies
without
words
represent
nothing
no
object
reducible
to
a
determined
concept
and
must
be
reckoned
among
free
beauties
but
does
not
this
necessitate
their
exclusion
from
true
and
proper
art
from
the
operation
of
genius
in
which
fancy
and
intellect
must
both
according
to
kant
have
a
place
sidenote
in
kant
this
is
baumgartenism
transposed
into
a
higher
key
more
concentrated
more
elaborated
more
suggestive
until
from
moment
to
moment
it
seems
about
to
burst
into
a
wholly
different
conception
of
art
but
it
is
still
baumgartenism
from
whose
intellectualistic
bonds
it
never
escapes
nor
was
escape
possible
a
profound
concept
of
imagination
was
entirely
lacking
to
kant
system
and
his
philosophy
of
the
spirit
glancing
over
the
table
of
faculties
of
the
spirit
which
precedes
his
of
judgment
we
see
that
kant
with
it
the
cognitive
faculty
the
feeling
of
pleasure
and
pain
and
the
appetitive
faculty
to
the
first
corresponds
intellect
to
the
second
judgement
teleological
and
æsthetic
to
the
third
reason
he
finds
no
place
for
imagination
amongst
powers
of
the
spirit
but
places
it
among
the
facts
of
sensation
he
knows
a
reproductive
imagination
and
an
associative
but
he
knows
nothing
of
a
genuinely
productive
imagination
imagination
in
the
proper
sense
we
have
seen
that
in
his
doctrine
genius
is
the
of
several
faculties
sidenote
forms
of
intuition
and
the
transcendental
yet
sometimes
kant
had
an
inkling
that
intellectual
activity
is
preceded
by
something
which
is
not
mere
sensational
material
but
is
an
independent
theoretical
form
he
obtained
a
glimpse
of
this
latter
form
not
when
he
was
reflecting
on
art
in
the
strict
sense
but
when
he
was
examining
the
process
of
knowledge
he
does
not
treat
of
it
in
his
of
judgment
but
in
the
first
section
of
his
of
pure
reason
in
the
first
part
of
the
doctrine
of
he
says
here
that
sensations
only
enter
the
spirit
when
the
latter
itself
gives
them
form
a
form
not
identical
with
that
which
intellect
gives
to
sensations
but
much
simpler
namely
pure
intuition
the
totality
of
the
principles
of
sensibility
there
must
therefore
be
a
science
which
forms
the
first
part
of
the
transcendental
doctrine
of
elements
distinct
from
that
which
contains
the
principles
of
pure
thought
and
is
named
transcendental
logic
now
what
name
does
kant
confer
upon
this
science
whose
existence
he
has
deduced
none
other
than
transcendental
æsthetic
transcendentale
in
a
note
he
even
insists
that
this
is
the
right
name
for
the
new
science
of
which
he
treats
and
censures
the
germans
for
their
habit
of
applying
it
to
the
critique
of
taste
which
as
he
thought
at
that
time
could
never
become
a
science
thus
he
concludes
we
approach
more
closely
to
the
usage
of
the
ancients
among
whom
the
distinction
between
καὶ
was
well
known
nevertheless
after
having
so
rightly
postulated
the
necessity
for
a
science
of
the
forms
of
sensation
or
pure
intuition
purely
intuitive
knowledge
kant
went
on
simply
because
he
had
no
exact
idea
of
the
nature
of
the
æsthetic
faculty
and
of
art
to
fall
into
an
intellectualistic
error
by
reducing
the
form
of
sensibility
or
pure
intuition
into
the
two
categories
or
functions
of
space
and
time
and
by
asserting
that
the
spirit
emerges
from
the
chaos
of
sensation
by
organizing
its
sensations
in
space
and
time
but
space
and
time
as
such
are
very
far
from
being
primitive
categories
they
are
relatively
late
and
complex
formations
as
examples
of
the
matter
of
sensation
kant
quoted
hardness
impenetrability
colour
and
so
forth
but
the
mind
only
recognizes
colour
and
hardness
in
so
far
as
it
has
already
given
form
to
its
sensations
considered
as
brute
matter
sensations
fall
outside
the
cognitive
spirit
they
are
a
limit
colour
hardness
impenetrability
and
so
on
when
recognized
are
already
intuitions
spiritual
elaborations
the
æsthetic
activity
in
its
rudimentary
manifestation
the
characterizing
or
qualifying
imagination
which
is
æsthetic
activity
ought
to
have
occupied
in
the
of
pure
the
pages
devoted
to
the
discussion
of
space
and
time
and
would
thus
have
constituted
a
real
transcendental
æsthetic
a
real
prologue
to
the
transcendental
logic
in
this
manner
kant
would
have
achieved
the
truth
aimed
at
by
leibniz
and
baumgarten
and
would
have
joined
hands
with
vico
sidenote
of
beauty
distinguished
by
kant
from
that
of
his
repeatedly
announced
opposition
to
the
school
of
wolff
concerns
not
the
concept
of
art
but
that
of
beauty
two
concepts
for
kant
entirely
distinct
first
of
all
he
did
not
admit
that
sensation
could
be
called
confused
knowledge
a
confused
form
that
is
of
intellectual
cognition
rightly
judging
this
to
be
a
false
account
of
sensibility
since
a
concept
however
confused
is
always
a
concept
or
a
rough
sketch
of
a
concept
never
an
intuition
but
he
further
denied
that
pure
beauty
contained
a
concept
and
therefore
denied
that
it
was
a
perfection
sensibly
apprehended
these
reflexions
have
no
doubt
some
connexion
with
those
concerning
the
nature
of
art
in
the
of
judgment
but
the
connexion
is
far
from
close
still
less
are
they
actually
fused
into
a
single
whole
that
kant
was
minutely
familiar
with
writers
who
had
discussed
beauty
and
taste
is
shown
by
his
lectures
wherein
they
are
all
quoted
and
used
of
these
the
greater
part
especially
the
english
were
sensationalists
others
intellectualists
some
few
as
we
have
noted
were
inclined
towards
mysticism
kant
began
by
tending
towards
sensationalism
in
æsthetic
problems
then
became
the
adversary
of
sensationalists
and
intellectualists
alike
this
development
can
be
traced
in
his
on
the
beautiful
and
sublime
as
well
as
in
his
lectures
its
final
expression
is
reached
in
the
of
of
the
four
moments
as
he
calls
them
the
four
determinations
he
accords
to
beauty
the
two
negative
are
directed
one
against
the
sensationalists
the
other
against
the
intellectualists
that
is
beautiful
which
pleases
that
is
beautiful
which
pleases
here
he
asserts
the
existence
of
a
spiritual
region
distinct
on
one
side
from
the
pleasurable
the
useful
and
the
good
and
on
the
other
from
truth
but
this
region
as
we
know
very
well
is
not
that
of
art
which
kant
attaches
to
the
concept
it
is
the
region
of
a
special
activity
of
feeling
which
he
calls
judgement
or
more
exactly
æsthetic
judgement
sidenote
features
in
kant
theory
of
the
other
two
moments
give
some
kind
of
a
definition
of
this
region
that
is
beautiful
which
has
the
form
of
finality
without
the
representation
of
an
end
that
is
beautiful
which
is
the
object
of
universal
pleasure
what
is
this
mysterious
sphere
what
this
disinterested
pleasure
we
experience
in
pure
colours
and
tones
in
flowers
and
even
in
adherent
beauty
when
we
make
abstraction
from
the
concept
to
which
it
adheres
our
answer
is
there
is
no
such
sphere
it
does
not
exist
the
examples
given
are
instances
either
of
pleasure
in
general
or
of
facts
of
artistic
expression
kant
who
so
emphatically
criticizes
the
sensationalists
and
the
intellectualists
does
not
show
the
same
severity
towards
the
line
of
thought
whose
revival
we
remarked
in
the
eighteenth
century
winckelmann
in
particular
exercised
strong
influence
over
his
mind
in
one
course
of
his
lectures
we
find
him
making
a
curious
distinction
between
form
and
matter
in
music
melody
is
matter
and
harmony
form
in
a
flower
the
scent
is
material
and
the
shape
is
form
this
reappears
slightly
modified
in
the
of
in
painting
statuary
and
all
the
figurative
arts
in
architecture
and
gardening
so
far
as
they
are
fine
arts
the
drawing
is
the
essential
in
which
the
foundation
of
taste
lies
not
in
what
gratifies
in
sensation
but
in
that
which
pleases
by
its
form
the
colours
which
illuminate
the
drawing
belong
to
sensuous
stimulus
and
may
bring
the
object
more
vividly
before
the
senses
but
do
not
render
it
worthy
of
contemplation
as
a
thing
of
beauty
they
are
moreover
often
limited
by
the
exigencies
of
the
beautiful
form
and
even
where
their
sensuous
stimulus
is
legitimate
they
are
ennobled
only
by
the
beautiful
form
continuing
in
pursuit
of
this
phantasm
of
beauty
which
is
not
the
beauty
of
art
nor
yet
the
pleasing
and
is
equally
detached
from
expressiveness
and
pleasure
kant
loses
himself
in
insoluble
contradictions
little
inclined
to
submit
himself
to
the
charm
of
imagination
abhorring
poetic
philosophers
like
herder
he
makes
statements
and
refuses
to
commit
himself
to
them
affirms
and
immediately
criticizes
his
affirmations
and
wraps
up
beauty
in
a
mystery
which
at
bottom
was
nothing
more
than
his
own
individual
incertitude
and
inability
to
see
clearly
the
existence
of
an
activity
of
feeling
which
in
the
spirit
of
his
sane
philosophy
represented
a
logical
contradiction
necessary
and
universal
pleasure
and
finality
without
the
idea
of
an
end
are
the
organized
expression
in
words
of
this
contradiction
by
way
of
clearing
up
the
contradiction
he
arrives
at
the
following
thought
the
judgement
of
taste
is
founded
on
a
concept
the
concept
of
a
general
foundation
of
the
subjective
teleology
of
nature
through
judgement
but
it
is
a
concept
by
which
it
is
impossible
to
know
or
demonstrate
anything
of
the
object
because
the
object
in
itself
is
indeterminable
and
unsuited
to
cognition
on
the
other
hand
it
has
validity
for
every
one
for
every
one
i
say
in
so
far
as
it
is
an
individual
judgement
immediately
accompanying
intuition
since
its
determining
reason
reposes
perhaps
in
the
concept
of
that
which
may
be
regarded
as
the
supersensible
substrate
of
mankind
beauty
then
is
a
symbol
of
morality
the
subjective
principle
alone
that
is
the
indeterminate
idea
of
the
supersensible
in
us
can
be
considered
the
only
key
able
to
unlock
this
faculty
springing
from
a
source
we
can
not
fathom
excepting
by
its
aid
no
comprehension
of
it
can
possibly
be
reached
these
cautious
words
and
all
others
here
used
by
kant
to
conceal
his
thoughts
do
not
hide
his
tendency
to
mysticism
a
mysticism
without
conviction
or
enthusiasm
almost
in
spite
of
himself
but
very
evident
nevertheless
his
inadequate
grasp
of
the
æsthetic
activity
led
him
to
see
double
even
triple
and
caused
the
unnecessary
multiplication
of
his
explanatory
principles
although
he
was
always
ignorant
of
the
genuine
nature
of
the
æsthetic
activity
he
was
indebted
to
it
for
suggesting
to
him
the
pure
categories
of
space
and
time
as
the
transcendental
æsthetic
it
caused
him
to
develop
the
theory
of
imaginative
embellishment
of
intellectual
concepts
by
the
work
of
genius
finally
it
forced
him
to
acknowledge
a
mysterious
faculty
of
feeling
midway
between
theoretical
and
practical
activity
cognitive
and
yet
not
cognitive
moral
and
indifferent
to
morality
pleasing
yet
wholly
detached
from
the
pleasure
of
the
senses
great
use
of
this
power
was
made
by
kant

the
correction
kant
was

which
dispelled

traces

his
abstract
subjectivism
sidenote
the
same
admiration
and
an
opinion
even
more
favourable
were
extended
by
them
to
friedrich

the
first
to
elaborate
that
part
of
kant
philosophy
and
to
study
the
third
sphere
which
united
sensibility
to
reason
it
was
the
artistic

dwelling
in

profoundly
philosophical

of

thought
against

against
his
conception
of

and
of

and
feeling
as
utterly
hostile
to

asserted
the
necessity
and
enunciated
the
principle
of
totality
and
reconciliation
even
before
it
had
been
recognized
by
professed
philosophers
to
schiller
must
be
allowed
the
great
merit
of
having
been
the
first
to
oppose
the
subjectivity
of
kant
and
of
having
dared
try
to
go
beyond
it
sidenote
between
schiller
and
discussion
has
raged
around
the
true
relation
between
schiller
and
kant
and
it
has
lately
been
maintained
that
his
æsthetic
was
not
as
would
seem
to
be
the
case
derived
from
kant
but
from
the
pandynamism
which
starting
from
leibniz
had
propagated
itself
in
germany
through
creuzens
ploucket
and
reimarus
down
to
herder
who
had
conceived
a
wholly
animated
nature
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
schiller
shared
herder
conception
as
may
be
seen
from
the
theosophical
tone
of
the
fragment
of
correspondence
between
julius
and
raphæl
and
in
other
writings
it
can
not
be
denied
however
that
whatever
personal
feelings
kant
may
have
had
towards
herder
or
herder
towards
his
former
teacher
against
whose
of
he
published
his
as
he
had
replied
to
the
of
pure
with
his
when
kant
in
a
somewhat
dubious
manner
made
the
first
step
towards
a
reconciliation
the
breach
was
at
all
events
partially
healed
the
dispute
is
therefore
of
small
importance
we
shall
find
it
more
useful
to
observe
that
schiller
introduced
an
important
correction
of
kant
views
when
he
obliterated
every
trace
of
the
double
theory
of
art
and
the
beautiful
giving
no
weight
to
the
distinction
drawn
between
pure
and
adherent
beauty
and
finally
abandoning
the
mechanical
conception
of
art
as
consisting
in
beauty
joined
to
the
intellectual
concept
it
was
certainly
his
own
experience
of
active
artistic
work
that
led
him
to
this
simplification
sidenote
æsthetic
sphere
as
the
sphere
of
schiller
defined
the
æsthetic
sphere
as
the
sphere
of
play
the
unfortunate
term
suggested
to
him
partly
by
some
phrases
of
kant
partly
perhaps
by
an
article
on
by
one
weisshuhn
which
he
published
in
his
review
has
given
rise
to
the
belief
that
he
anticipated
certain
modern
doctrines
of
artistic
activity
as
the
overflow
of
exuberant
spirits
analogous
with
the
play
of
children
and
animals
schiller
did
not
fail
to
warn
his
readers
against
such
a
mistaken
interpretation
to
which
however
he
lent
himself
when
he
begged
them
not
to
think
of
games
in
real
life
which
are
usually
concerned
with
wholly
material
things
nor
yet
of
the
idle
dreaming
of
the
imagination
left
to
itself
the
activity
of
the
play
of
which
he
treated
held
the
mean
between
the
material
activity
of
the
senses
of
nature
of
animal
instinct
or
passion
as
it
is
called
and
the
formal
activity
of
intellect
and
morality
the
man
who
plays
contemplates
nature
æsthetically
and
produces
art
sees
all
natural
objects
as
animated
in
such
a
phantasmagoria
mere
natural
necessity
gives
place
to
the
free
determination
of
the
faculties
spirit
appears
as
spontaneously
reconciled
with
nature
form
with
matter
beauty
is
life
the
living
form
gestalt
not
life
in
the
physiological
sense
since
beauty
does
not
extend
throughout
all
physiological
life
nor
is
it
restricted
to
that
alone
marble
when
worked
by
an
artist
may
have
a
living
form
and
a
man
although
possessed
of
life
and
form
need
not
be
a
living
form
wherefore
art
must
conquer
nature
with
form
in
an
artistic
work
of
true
beauty
the
content
ought
to
be
nil
the
form
everything
by
form
man
is
influenced
in
his
entirety
by
content
in
his
separate
faculties
only
the
true
secret
of
great
artists
is
that
they
cancel
matter
through
form
stoff
durch
die
form
vertilgt
the
more
imposing
overwhelming
or
seductive
the
matter
is
in
itself
the
greater
its
obstinacy
in
striving
to
emphasize
its
own
particular
effect
the
more
the
spectator
inclines
to
lose
himself
immediately
in
the
matter
so
much
the
more
triumphant
is
the
art
which
brings
it
into
subjection
and
enforces
its
own
sovereign
power
the
mind
of
hearer
or
spectator
should
remain
perfectly

the

circle

it
should
issue
as
pure
and
perfect
as
when
it
left

of
the
creator
the
most
frivolous
object
should
be
treated
in

manner
as
to
enable

to

at

may

from
them
to

game
there

of

a
passionate
fine
art
would
be
a
contradiction
in
terms
so
long
as
man
in
his
early
physical
state
passively
absorbs
the
world
of
senses
and
simply
feels
it
he
is
one
with
it
and
precisely
because
he
merely
is
a
world
there
is
for
him
as
yet
no
world
at
all
only
when
in
his
æsthetic
state
he
places
the
world
outside
himself
and
contemplates
it
does
he
detach
his
personality
from
the
rest
then
a
world
appears
to
him
since
he
is
no
longer
one
with
the
world
sidenote
schiller
ascribed
high
educational
value
to
art
thus
conceived
as
at
once
sensible
and
rational
material
and
formal
not
that
it
teaches
moral
precepts
or
excites
to
good
actions
if
it

thus
or
when

thus
it
would
at

we
have

determination
in
whatsoever
direction
to
the
good
or
the
bad
to
pleasure
or
to
duty
destroys
the
character
of
the
æsthetic
sphere
which
is
rather
indeterminism
by
means
of
art
man
frees
himself
from
the
yoke
of
the
senses
but
before
putting
himself
spontaneously
under
that
of
reason
and
duty
he
takes
as
it
were
a
little
by
staying
in
a
region
of
indifference
and
serene
contemplation
while
having
no
claim
to
promote
exclusively
any
special
human
faculty
the
æsthetic
condition
is
favourable
to
each
and
all
without
favouritism
and
the
reason
why
it
favours
none
in
particular
is
that
it
is
the
foundation
of
the
possibility
of
all
alike
every
other
exercise
gives
some
inclination
to
the
soul
and
therefore
presupposes
a
special
limit
æsthetic
activity
alone
is
unlimited
this
indifference
which
if
not
yet
pure
form
is
not
pure
matter
confers
its
educational
value
on
art
it
opens
a
way
to
morality
not
by
preaching
and
persuading
that
is
to
say
determining
but
by
making
determination
possible
such
is
the
fundamental
concept
of
his
celebrated
on
the
æsthetic
education
of
in
which
schiller
took
his
cue
from
the
conditions
of
his
times
and
from
the
necessity
of
finding
a
middle
way
between
supine
acquiescence
in
tyranny
and
savage
rebellion
as
exemplified
by
the
revolution
then
raging
in
france
sidenote
and
lack
of
precision
in
schiller
the
defects
of
schiller
æsthetic
doctrine
are
its
lack
of
precision
and
its
generality
who
has
given
a
better
description
of
certain
aspects
of
art
the
catharsis
produced
by
artistic
activity
the
serenity
and
calm
resulting
from
the
domination
over
natural
impressions
equally
just
is
his
remark
that
art
although
wholly
independent
of
morality
is
in
some
way
connected
with
it
but
what
precisely
this
connexion
may
be
or
what
the
exact
nature
of
æsthetic
activity
schiller
does
not
succeed
in
explaining
conceiving
the
moral
and
intellectual
as
the
only
formal
activities
and
denying
as
a
convinced
in
opposition
to
burke
and
philosophers
of
his
type
that
art
can
belong
to
the
passionate
and
sensuous
nature
he
cut
himself
off
from
the
means
of
recognizing
the
general
category
to
which
artistic
activity
belongs
his
own
concept
of
the
formal
is
too
narrow
too
narrow
also
his
concept
of
the
cognitive
activity
in
which
he
is
able
to
see
the
logical
or
intellectual
form
but
not
that
of
the
imagination
what
for
him
was
this
art
he
describes
as
an
activity
neither
formal
nor
material
neither
cognitive
nor
moral
was
it
for
him
as
for
kant
an
activity
of
feeling
a
play
of
several
faculties
at
once
it
would
seem
so
since
schiller
distinguishes
four
points
of
view
or
relations
of
man
with
things
the
physical
in
which
these
affect
our
senses
the
logical
in
which
they
excite
knowledge
the
moral
in
which
they
appear
to
us
as
an
object
of
rational
volition
and
the
æsthetic
in
which
they
refer
to
our
powers
in
entirety
without
becoming
the
determinate
object
of
any
one
faculty
for
example
a
man
is
pleased
æsthetically
when
his
feeling
depends
in
no
way
on
the
pleasure
of
the
senses
and
when
he
is
not
conscious
of
thinking
about
any
law
or
end
we
look
in
vain
for
any
more
conclusive
reply
it
must
not
be
overlooked
that
schiller
delivered
a
course
of
lectures
on
æsthetic
in
jena
university
in
and
that
his
writings
on
the
subject
intended
for
reviews
were
couched
in
a
popular
style
no
less
popular
in
his
own
opinion
was
the
style
of
the
book
quoted
above
which
grew
out
of
a
series
of
letters
actually
sent
to
his
patron
the
duke
of
but
the
great
work
to
be
entitled
which
he
intended
writing
upon
æsthetic
was
never
completed
the
only
fragments
which
have
reached
us
are
contained
in
the
correspondence
with
körner
from
the
discussions
between
the
two
friends
we
gather
that
körner
was
not
satisfied
with
formula
and
desired
something
objective
something
more
precise
a
positive
characteristic
of
the
beautiful
and
one
day
schiller
told
him
that
he
had
definitely
discovered
such
a
characteristic
but
what
it
was
that
he
had
discovered
we
do
not
know
no
mention
of
it
occurs
in
any
further
document
and
we
are
left
in
doubt
as
to
whether
we
have
lost
an
integral
part
of
his
thought
or
merely
the
momentary
illusion
of
a
discovery
sidenote
caution
and
the
rashness
of
the
the
uncertainty
and
vagueness
of
schiller
theory
seem
almost
a
merit
in
contrast
with
that
which
followed
he
had
constituted
himself
guardian
of
the
teaching
of
kant
and
refused
to
abandon
the
realm
of
criticism
faithful
disciple
of
his
master
he
conceived
the
third
sphere
not
as
real
but
as
an
ideal
a
concept
not
constitutive
but
regulative
an
imperative
from
transcendental
motives
reason
here
demands
that
communion
be
established
between
formal
and
material
activity
that
is
to
say
there
must
be
an
activity
of
play
since
the
concept
of
humanity
can
be
complete
only
by
the
union
of
reality
with
form
the
accidental
with
the
necessary
passivity
with
liberty
this
demand
must
be
made
because
reason
in
conformity
with
her
essence
aims
at
perfection
and
at
sweeping
away
all
obstacles
and
every
exclusive
operation
of
one
or
other
activity
leaves
humanity
incomplete
and
confined
within
limits
schiller
thought
as
it
appears
in
his
correspondence
with
körner
has
been
well
represented
as
follows
the
union
of
sensibility
with
liberty
in
the
beautiful
which
does
not
actually
take
place
but
is
supposed
to
do
so
suggests
to
man
an
intuition
of
the
union
of
these
elements
within
himself
a
union
which
does
not
take
place
actually
but
ought
to
do
so
the
times
which
followed
had
no
such
nice
scruples
kant
had
given
new
vigour
to
the
production
of
works
on
æsthetic
and
as
in
the
days
following
baumgarten
every
new
year
saw
a
number
of
new
treatises
it
was
the
fashion
nothing
swarms
like
æstheticians
wrote
jean
paul
richter
in
when
preparing
his
own
book
on
the
subject
for
publication
it
is
rare
for
a
youth
who
has
paid
his
fees
for
a
course
of
lectures
on
æsthetic
not
to
produce
a
book
on
some
point
of
the
science
in
the
hope
that
the
public
may
refund
him
his
expenses
by
buying
his
book
some
there
are
indeed
who
pay
their
professor
fees
out
of
their
author
royalties
it
was
hoped
not
unreasonably
that
the
exploration
of
the
obscure
region
of
æsthetic
might
throw
some
light
on
metaphysics
and
the
procedure
of
artists
seemed
to
offer
a
good
example
to
philosophers
seeking
to
create
a
world
for
themselves
so
philosophy
modelled
itself
upon
art
and
as
though
to
render
the
transition
easier
the
concept
of
art
was
brought
as
close
as
possible
to
that
of
philosophy
romanticism
gaining
vogue
daily
was
a
renewal
or
continuation
of
that
age
of
genius
in
which
the
youth
of
goethe
and
schiller
had
been
passed
and
as
the
period
of
und
had
zealously
worshipped
the
genius
who
breaks
all
rules
and
oversteps
all
limitations
so
did
romanticism
hail
the
domination
of
a
faculty
called
fancy
or
more
frequently
imagination
to
which
were
attributed
the
most
diverse
characteristics
and
the
most
miraculous
effects
sidenote
on
art
the
romantic
theorists
artists
themselves
for
the
most
part
abounded
in
truthful
and
subtle
observations
concerning
artistic
procedure
jean
paul
richter
makes
many
excellent
remarks
about
productive
imagination
which
he
distinguishes
clearly
from
the
reproductive
and
asserts
to
be
shared
by
all
men
as
soon
as
they
are
able
to
say
this
is
beautiful
for
how
could
a
genius
be
acclaimed
or
even
tolerated
for
a
single
month
not
to
mention
thousands
of
centuries
by
the
common
herd
if
he
had
not
a
strong
of
relationship
with
the
herd
he
also
describes
how
imagination
is
variously
divided
among
individuals
as
simple
talent
as
passive
or
feminine
genius
and
in
the
highest
degree
as
the
active
or
masculine
genius
formed
by
reflexion
and
instinct
in
which
all
faculties
flourish
simultaneously
and
fancy
is
no
isolated
flower
but
the
goddess
flora
herself
who
in
order
to
produce
new
combinations
crosses
with
each
other
those
blossoms
whose
conjunction
is
fertile
and
is
so
to
speak
a
faculty
full
of
faculties
this
latter
sentence
betrays
a
tendency
on
part
to
exaggerate
the
functions
of
imagination
and
to
construct
upon
it
a
kind
of
mythology
sidenote
æsthetic
and
idealistic
contemporary
systems
of
philosophy
are
partly
impregnated
with
and
partly
the
source
of
such
mythologies
the
romantic
conception
of
art
may
be
said
to
have
found
its
most
complete
expression
in
german
idealism
where
this
attained
its
most
coherent
and
systematic
form
sidenote
it
did
not
attain
this
form
with
fichte
the
first
great
pupil
of
kant
for
though
fichte
regarded
imagination
as
the
activity
which
creates
the
universe
effects
the
synthesis
of
the
ego
and
the
posits
the
object
and
therefore
precedes
consciousness
he
does
not
connect
it
with
art
in
his
æsthetic
notions
fichte
is
influenced
by
schiller
with
the
addition
of
a
moralism
imposed
upon
him
by
the
general
character
of
his
system
hence
the
ethical
sphere
midway
between
the
cognitive
and
the
æsthetic
becomes
from
his
point
of
view
a
mere
appurtenance
of
morality
as
being
the
representation
of
and
hence
reverence
for
the
moral
ideal
his
subjective
idealism
eventually
produced
an
æsthetic
doctrine
through
the
work
of
friedrich
schlegel
and
ludwig
tieck
the
doctrine
of
irony
as
the
basis
of
art
sidenote
schlegel
tieck
the
ego
which
created
the
universe
can
also
destroy
it
the
universe
is
an
empty
appearance
at
which
the
only
true
reality
the
ego
can
smile
holding
itself
aloof
like
an
artist
or
a
creative
god
from
creatures
of
its
own
which
it
does
not
take
seriously
friedrich
schlegel
described
art
as
a
perpetual
parody
of
itself
and
a
transcendental
farce
tieck
defined
irony
as
a
power
which
allows
the
poet
to
dominate

he
handles

given
at
jena

at

distributed
subsequently
in
manuscript
notes
all
over

to
the
no

celebrated
lecture
on
the
between
the
figurative
arts
and
as
well
as
to
other
works
of
this
eloquent
and
enthusiastic
philosopher
that
we
owe
the
first
great
philosophical
affirmation
of
romanticism
and
of
a
renewed
and
conscious
in
æsthetic
sidenote
and
like
all
the
other
idealistic
philosophers
schelling
held
firmly
to
the
fusion
of
the
theories
of
art
and
the
beautiful
already
effected
by
schiller
from
this
point
of
view
it
is
interesting
to
note
his
explanation
of
the
condemnation
of
art
by
plato
this
condemnation
says
schelling
was
directed
against
the
art
of
his
time
the
natural
and
realistic
art
of
antiquity
in
general
with
its
character
of
finitude
plato
could
not
have
uttered
such
a
condemnation
as
we
moderns
are
unable
to
utter
it
if
he
had
known
christian
art
whose
characteristic
is
infinity
the
pure
abstract
beauty
of
winckelmann
is
not
enough
no
less
inadequate
false
and
negative
is
that
concept
of
the
characteristic
which
would
try
to
make
art
something
dead
hard
and
ugly
by
imposing
upon
it
the
limitations
of
the
individual
art
is
beauty
and
characteristic
in
one
characteristic
beauty
character
from
which
beauty
is
evolved
according
to
goethe
saying
it
is
therefore
not
the
individual
but
the
living
concept
of
the
individual
when
the
artist
eye
recognizes
the
creative
idea
of
the
individual
and
draws
it
forth
he
transforms
the
individual
into
a
world
in
itself
into
a
species
an
eternal
idea
and
fears
no
more
the
limitation
or
hardness
which
is
the
condition
of
life
characteristic
beauty
is
that
plenitude
of
form
which
kills
form
it
does
not
inflame
passion
it
regulates
it
like
the
banks
of
a
river
which
are
filled
but
not
overflowed
by
the
waters
in
all
of
this
we
feel
the
influence
of
schiller
with
something
added
which
schiller
could
never
have
expressed
sidenote
and
indeed
whilst
gratefully
acknowledging
the
excellent
contributions
to
the
theory
of
art
made
by
the
writers
who
succeeded
kant
schelling
laments
that
in
none
of
them
can
he
find
exact
scientific
method
the
true
point
of
departure
in
his
theory
is
in
the
philosophy
of
nature
in
that
criticism
of
the
teleological
judgement
which
kant
places
directly
after
that
of
the
æsthetic
judgement
in
his
third
teleology
is
the
union
of
theoretical
and
practical
philosophy
but
the
system
would
be
incomplete
but
for
the
possibility
of
demonstrating
in
the
subject
itself
in
the
ego
the
identity
of
the
two
worlds
theoretical
and
practical
an
activity
which
has
and
at
the
same
time
has
not
consciousness
unconscious
as
nature
conscious
as
spirit
this
activity
is
precisely
the
æsthetic
activity
the
general
organ
of
philosophy
keystone
of
the
whole
edifice
there
are
but
two
ways
open
to
one
who
is
desirous
of
escaping
from
common
realities
poetry
which
transports
into
the
ideal
world
and
philosophy
which
annihilates
the
real
world
strictly
speaking
there
is
but
one
sole
absolute
work
of
art
it
may
exist
in
various
exemplars
but
in
itself
it
is
one
although
it
may
not
yet
possess
existence
in
its
original
form
true
art
is
not
the
impression
of
one
moment
but
the
representation
of
infinite
life
it
is
transcendental
intuition
become
objective
and
is
therefore
not
only
the
organ
but
the
document
of
philosophy
a
time
will
come
when
philosophy
will
return
to
poetry
from
which
she
has
detached
herself
and
from
the
new
philosophy
a
new
mythology
will
arise
the
absolute
is
thus
the
object
of
art
as
well
as
of
philosophy
as
schelling
insists
elsewhere
in
greater
detail
the
first
represents
it
in
idea
the
second
in
its
reflexion
philosophy
portrays
ideas
not
realities
so
is
it
with
art
those
same
ideas
of
which
real
things
as
philosophy
demonstrates
are
imperfect
copies
themselves
appear
in
the
objective
arts
as
ideas
in
all
their
perfection
and
represent
the
intellectual
world
in
the
world
of
reflexion
music
is
the
very
ideal
rhythm
of
nature
and
the
universe
which
by
means
of
this
art
makes
itself
felt
in
the
derivative
world
perfect
creations
of
statuary
are
the
very
ideas
of
organic
nature
represented
objectively
the
homeric
epic
the
very
identity
constituting
the
foundation
of
history
in
the
absolute
but
while
philosophy
gives
an
immediate
representation
of
the
divine
of
absolute
identity
art
can
but
give
the
immediate
representation
of
indifference
and
since
the
degree
of
perfection
or
reality
in
a
thing
becomes
higher
in
proportion
as
it
approaches
nearer
to
the
absolute
idea
and
the
fulness
of
infinite
affirmation
and
in
proportion
as
it
comprehends
within
itself
other
powers
it
is
clear
that
art
above
everything
else
is
in
closest
relation
with
philosophy
from
which
it
is
distinguished
merely
by
the
character
of
its
specification
in
everything
else
it
may
be
considered
as
the
highest
power
in
the
ideal
world
to
the
three
powers
of
the
real
and
ideal
world
correspond
in
a
rising
scale
the
three
ideas
of
truth
goodness
and
beauty
beauty
is
neither
the
mere
universal
truth
nor
mere
reality
action
but
the
perfect
interpenetration
of
both
beauty
exists
when
the
particular
the
real
is
so
adequate
to
its
concept
that
the
latter
as
infinite
enters
the
finite
and
presents
itself
to
our
contemplation
in
concrete
form
with
the
appearance
of
the
concept
the
real
becomes
truly
similar
and
equal
to
the
idea
wherein
the
universal
and
the
particular
find
their
absolute
identity
without
ceasing
to
be
rational
the
rational
becomes
at
the
same
time
apparent
and
sensible
but
as
above
the
three
powers
is
poised
god
their
point
of
union
so
philosophy
stands
supreme
over
the
three
ideas
concerning
itself
not
with
truth
or
morality
or
even
beauty
alone
but
with
that
which
belongs
to
all
the
three
in
common
deduced
from
one
common
source
if
philosophy
assumes
the
character
of
science
and
truth
while
yet
remaining
superior
to
truth
this
is
made
possible
by
the
fact
that
science
and
truth
are
its
formal
determination
philosophy
is
science
in
the
sense
that
truth
goodness
and
beauty
science
virtue
and
art
interpenetrate
each
other
therefore
it
is
also
not
science
but
is
that
which
is
common
to
science
virtue
and
art
this
interpenetration
distinguishes
philosophy
from
all
other
sciences
for
instance
if
mathematics
can
dispense
with
morality
and
beauty
philosophy
can
not
do
so
sidenote
and
the
gods
art
and
in
beauty
are
contained
truth
and
goodness
necessity
and
liberty
when
beauty
appears
to
be
in
conflict
with
truth
the
truth
in
question
is
a
finite
truth
with
which
beauty
ought
not
to
agree
because
as
we
have
seen
the
art
of
naturalism
and
of
the
merely
characteristic
is
a
false
art
the
individual
forms
of
art
being
in
themselves
representatives
of
the
infinite
and
the
universe
are
called
ideas
considered
from
the
point
of
view
of
reality
ideas
are
gods
their
essence
their
is
in
fact
equivalent
to
god
every
idea
is
an
idea
so
far
as
it
is
god
in
a
particular
form
every
idea
therefore
is
equal
to
god
but
to
a
particular
god
characteristic
of
all
the
gods
is
pure
limitation
and
indivisible
absoluteness
minerva
is
the
idea
of
wisdom
united
with
strength
but
she
is
lacking
in
womanly
tenderness
juno
is
power
without
wisdom
and
without
the
sweet
attraction
of
love
for
which
she
is
forced
to
borrow
the
cestus
of
venus
venus
again
has
not
the
weighty
wisdom
of
minerva
what
would
become
of
these
ideas
if
deprived
of
their
limitations
they
would
cease
to
be
objects
of
imagination
imagination
is
a
faculty
which
has
no
connexion
with
pure
intellect
or
with
reason
and
is
distinct
from
fancy
which
collects
and
arranges
the
products
of
art
whereas
imagination
intuits
them
forms
them
out
of
itself
represents
them
imagination
is
to
fancy
as
intellectual
intuition
is
to
reason
it
is
therefore
the
intellectual
intuition
of
art
reason
no
longer
suffices
in
a
philosophy
such
as
this
intellectual
intuition
which
for
kant
was
a
limiting
concept
is
now
asserted
as
really
existing
intellect
sinks
to
a
subordinate
place
even
the
genuine
imagination
which
operates
in
art
is
overshadowed
by
this
imagination
twin
with
intellectual
intuition
who
sometimes
changes
places
with
this
sister
of
hers
mythology

proclaimed
a
necessary
condition
of
all

mythology
which
is
not
allegory
for
in
the
latter
the

signifies
only
the
universal
while
the
former
is
already
itself
the
universal
which
explains
how
easy
it
is
to
allegorize
and
how
fascinating
are
such
poems
as
those
of
homer
which
lend
themselves
to
such
interpretations
christian
as
well
as
hellenic
art
has
its
mythology
christ
the
persons
of
the
trinity
the
virgin
mother
of

the
fine
between
mythology
and

is
as
shadowy
as
that
between
art
and
philosophy
sidenote
the
year
saw
the
publication
of
solger
principal
work
a
long
philosophical
dialogue
on
the
beautiful
subsequently
in
he
gave
a
course
of
lectures
on
æsthetic
which
were
published
posthumously
he
was
one
of
those
who
found
but
a
glimpse
of
truth
in
kant
and
held
the
in
very
slight
estimation
particularly
fichte
in
schelling
who
begins
from
the
original
unity
of
the
subjective
and
the
objective
he
detects
for
the
first
time
a
speculative
principle
not
adequately
developed
since
schelling
had
never
triumphed
dialectically
over
the
difficulties
of
intellectual
intuition
sidenote
and
solger
was
one
of
those
who
conceived
of
imagination
as
totally
distinct
from
fancy
fancy
says
he
belongs
to
common
cognition
and
is
none
other
than
the
human
consciousness
in
so
far
as
it
continues
in
temporal
succession
infinitely
reasserting
an
original
intuition
it
presupposes
the
distinctions
between
common
cognition
abstraction
and
judgement
concept
and
representation
amongst
which
it
acts
as
mediator
by
giving
to
the
general
concept
the
form
of
individual
representation
and
to
the
latter
the
form
of
a
general
concept
in
this
manner
it
has
its
being
among
the
antitheses
of
the
ordinary
understanding
imagination
is
totally
different
proceeding
from
the
original
unity
of
the
antitheses
in
the
idea
it
acts
so
that
the
elements
in
opposition
separated
as
they
are
from
the
idea
find
themselves
united
in
the
reality
by
its
means
we
are
capable
of
apprehending
objects
higher
than
those
of
common
cognition
and
of
recognizing
in
them
the
idea
itself
as
real
also
in
art
it
is
the
faculty
of
transforming
the
idea
into
reality
it
presents
itself
in
three
modes
or
degrees
as
imagination
of
the
imagination
which
conceives
the
whole
as
idea
and
activity
as
nothing
more
than
the
development
of
the
idea
in
reality
as
sensibility
of
the
imagination
in
so
far
as
it
expresses
the
life
of
the
idea
in
the
real
and
reduces
the
one
to
the
other
lastly
and
here
we
have
the
highest
grade
of
artistic
activity
corresponding
with
dialectic
in
philosophy
as
intellect
of
the
imagination
or
artistic
dialectic
conceiving
idea
and
reality
in
such
a
way
that
one
passes
over
into
the
other
that
is
to
say
into
reality
other
divisions
and
subdivisions
are
made
on
which
it
is
not
necessary
to
dwell
imagination
is
said
to
produce
the
irony
essential
to
true
art
this
is
the
irony
of
tieck
and
novalis
of
whom
solger
is
in
a
sense
a
follower
sidenote
practice
and
solger
joins
schelling
in
placing
beauty
in
the
region
of
the
idea
inaccessible
to
common
consciousness
it
is
distinct
from
the
idea
of
truth
because
instead
of
dissolving
the
appearances
of
common
consciousness
after
the
manner
of
truth
art
accomplishes
the
miracle
of
making
appearance
dissolve
itself
while
still
remaining
appearance
artistic
thought
therefore
is
practical
not
theoretical
furthermore
it
is
distinct
from
the
idea
of
goodness
with
which
at
first
sight
it
would
seem
to
be
closely
related
because
in
the
case
of
goodness
the
union
of
ideal
with
real
of
the
simple
with
the
multiple
of
the
infinite
with
the
finite
is
not
real
and
complete
but
remains
ideal
a
mere
it
is
related
more
closely
to
religion
which
thinks
the
idea
as
the
abyss
of
life
where
our
individual
conscience
must
lose
itself
in
order
to
become
essential
while
in
beauty
and
art
the
idea
manifests
itself
by
gathering
into
itself
the
world
of
distinctions
between
universal
and
particular
and
placing
itself
in
their
place
artistic
activity
is
more
than
theoretical
it
is
of
a
practical
nature
but
realized
and
perfected
art
therefore
belongs
not
to
theoretical
philosophy
as
kant
thought
according
to
solger
but
to
practical
necessarily
attached
on
one
side
to
infinity
it
can
not
have
common
nature
as
its
object
for
example
art
is
absent
from
a
portrait
and
the
ancients
showed
their
discrimination
in
selecting
gods
and
heroes
for
objects
in
sculpture
since
every
deity
even
in
limited
and
particular
form
always
signifies
a
determinate
modification
of
the
idea
sidenote
f
the
same
concept
of
art
appears
in
the
philosophy
of
hegel
whatever
may
be
the
minor
differences
which
he
felt
to
separate
himself
from
his
predecessors
little
concerned
as
we
are
with
the
shades
and
varieties
of
mystical
æsthetic
exhibited
by
each
of
these
thinkers
we
are
chiefly
concerned
to
lay
bare
the
substantial
underlying
identity
the
mysticism
of
arbitrarism
which
gives
them
their
historic
place
in
æsthetic
sidenote
in
the
sphere
of
absolute
opening
the
and
the
of
spirit
one
need
not
expect
to
find
any
discussion
of
art
in
the
analysis
of
the
forms
of
the
theoretical
spirit
among
definitions
of
sensibility
and
intuition
language
and
symbolism
and
various
grades
of
imagination
and
thought
hegel
places
art
in
the
sphere
of
absolute
spirit
together
with
religion
and
philosophy
and
in
this
he
regards
kant
schiller
schelling
and
solger
as
his
precursors
for
like
them
he
strongly
denies
that
art
has
the
function
of
representing
the
abstract
concept
but
not
that
it
represents
the
concrete
concept
or
idea
hegel
whole
philosophy
consists
in
the
affirmation
of
a
concrete
concept
unknown
to
ordinary
or
scientific
thought
indeed
says
he
no
concept
has
in
our
day
been
more
mishandled
than
the
concept
in
itself
and
for
itself
for
by
concept
is
generally
meant
the
abstract
determinateness
or
of
representation
and
intellectualistic
thought
with
which
it
is
naturally
impossible
to
think
either
the
entirety
of
truth
or
concrete
beauty
to
the
realm
of
the
concrete
concept
belongs
art
as
one
of
the
three
forms
wherein
the
freedom
of
the
spirit
is
achieved
it
is
the
first
form
namely
that
of
immediate
sensible
objective
knowledge
the
second
is
religion
a
representative
consciousness
worship
an
element
extraneous
to
mere
art
the
third
is
philosophy
free
thought
of
the
absolute
spirit
sidenote
as
sensible
appearance
of
the
beauty
and
truth
are
at
the
same
time
one
yet
distinct
truth
is
idea
as
idea
according
to
its
and
its
universal
principle
and
so
far
as
it
is
thought
as
such
there
is
no
sensible
or
material
existence
in
truth
thought
contemplates
therein
nothing
but
universal
idea
but
the
idea
must
also
realize
itself
externally
and
attain
an
actual
and
determinate
existence
truth
also
as
such
has
existence
but
when
in
its
determinate
external
existence
it
is
immediately
for
consciousness
and
the
concept
remains
immediately
one
with
the
external
appearance
the
idea
is
not
only
true
but
beautiful
in
this
way
beauty
may
be
defined
as
the
sensible
appearance
of
the
idea
the
idea
is
the
content
of
art
its
sensible
and
imaginative
configuration
its
form
two
elements
which
must
interpenetrate
and
form
a
whole
hence
the
necessity
that
a
content
destined
to
become
a
work
of
art
should
show
itself
capable
of
such
transformation
otherwise
we
have
but
an
imperfect
union
of
poetic
form
with
prosaic
and
incongruous
content
an
ideal
content
must
gleam
through
the
sensible
form
the
form
is
spiritualized
by
this
ideal
light
artistic
imagination
does
not
work
in
the
same
way
as
the
passive
or
receptive
fancy
it
does
not
stop
at
the
appearances
of
sensible
reality
but
searches
for
the
internal
truth
and
rationality
of
the
real
the
rationality
of
the
object
selected
by
him
should
not
be
alone
in
awakening
the
consciousness
of
the
artist
he
should
have
well
meditated
upon
the
essential
and
the
true
in
all
their
extension
and
profundity
for
without
reflexion
a
man
can
not
become
conscious
of
that
which
is
within
himself
and
all
great
works
of
art
show
that
their
material
has
been
thought
again
and
again
from
every
side
no
successful
work
of
art
can
issue
from
light
and
careless
imagination
it
is
a
delusion
to
fancy
that
poet
and
painter
need
nothing
beyond
intuitions
a
true
poet
must
reflect
and
meditate
before
and
during
the
execution
of
his
poem
but
it
is
always
understood
that
the
thought
of
the
poet
does
not
take
the
form
of
abstraction
sidenote
in
metaphysical
idealism
and
some
critics
affirm
that
the
æsthetic
movement
from
schelling
to
hegel
is
a
revived
baumgartenism
on
the
ground
that
this
movement
regarded
art
as
a
mediator
of
philosophical
concepts
they
mention
the
fact
that
a
follower
of
schelling
one
ast
was
moved
by
the
trend
of
his
system
to
substitute
didactic
poetry
for
drama
as
the
highest
form
of
art
putting
aside
some
isolated
and
accidental
deviations
there
is
no
truth
in
this
affirmation
these
philosophers
are
hostile
to
intellectualistic
and
moralistic
views
frequently
entering
upon
definite
and
explicit
polemic
against
them
schelling
wrote
æsthetic
production
is
in
its
origin
an
absolutely
free
production
this
independence
on
any
extraneous
purpose
constitutes
the
sanctity
and
purity
of
art
enabling
it
to
repel
all
connexion
with
mere
pleasure
a
connexion
which
is
a
mark
of
barbarism
or
with
utility
which
can
not
be
demanded
of
art
save
at
times
when
the
loftiest
form
of
the
human
spirit
is
found
in
utilitarian
discoveries
the
same
reasons
forbid
an
alliance
with
morality
and
hold
even
science
at
arm
length
although
nearest
by
reason
of
her
disinterestedness
having
her
aim
however
outside
herself
she
must
restrict
herself
definitely
to
serve
as
means
to
something
higher
than
herself
the
arts
hegel
says
art
contains
no
universal
as
such
if
the
aim
of
instruction
is
treated
as
an
aim
so
that
the
nature
of
the
content
represented
appears
for
itself
directly
as
an
abstract
proposition
prosaic
reflexion
or
general
theory
and
is
not
merely
contained
indirectly
and
implicitly
in
the
concrete
artistic
form
the
result
of
such
a
separation
is
to
reduce
the
sensible
and
imaginative
form
the
true
constituent
of
a
work
of
art
to
an
idle
ornament
a
covering
presented
simply
as
a
covering
an
appearance
maintained
as
mere
appearance
the
very
nature
of
the
work
of
art
is
thus
completely
altered
for
a
work
of
art
must
not
present
to
intuition
a
content
in
its
universality
but
this
universal
individualized
and
converted
into
a
sensible
individual
it
is
a
bad
sign
he
adds
when
an
artist
sets
himself
about
his
work
from
a
motive
of
abstract
ideas
instead
of
that
of
the
fulness
of
life
des
the
aim
of
art
lies
in
itself
in
presentation
of
truth
in
a
sensible
form
any
other
aim
is
altogether
extraneous
it
would
not
be
hard
to
prove
certainly
that
by
separating
art
from
pure
representation
and
imagination
and
making
it
in
some
sense
the
vehicle
of
the
concept
the
universal
the
infinite
these
philosophers
were
facing
in
the
direction
of
the
road
opened
by
baumgarten
but
to
prove
this
would
mean
accepting
as
a
presupposition
the
dilemma
that
if
art
be
not
pure
imagination
it
must
be
sensuous
and
subordinate
to
reason
and
it
is
just
this
presupposition
and
dilemma
that
the
metaphysical
idealists
denied
the
road
they
tried
to
follow
was
to
conceive
a
faculty
which
should
be
neither
imagination
nor
intellect
but
should
partake
of
both
an
intellectual
intuition
or
intuitive
intellect
a
mental
imagination
after
the
fashion
of
plotinus
sidenote
and
decay
of
art
in
hegel
in
a
greater
degree
than
any
of
his
predecessors
hegel
emphasized
the
cognitive
character
of
art
but
this
very
merit
brought
him
into
a
difficulty
more
easily
avoided
by
the
rest
art
being
placed
in
the
sphere
of
absolute
spirit
in
company
with
religion
and
philosophy
how
will
she
be
able
to
hold
her
own
in
such
powerful
and
aggressive
company
especially
in
that
of
philosophy
which
in
the
hegelian
system
stands
at
the
summit
of
all
spiritual
evolution
if
art
and
religion
fulfilled
functions
other
than
the
knowledge
of
the
absolute
they
would
be
inferior
levels
of
the
spirit
but
yet
necessary
and
indispensable
but
if
they
have
in
view
the
same
end
as
philosophy
and
are
allowed
to
compete
with
it
what
value
can
they
retain
none
whatever
or
at
the
very
most
they
may
have
that
sort
of
value
which
attaches
to
transitory
historical
phases
in
the
life
of
humanity
the
principles
of
hegel
system
are
at
bottom
rationalistic
and
hostile
to
religion
and
hostile
no
less
to
art
a
strange
and
painful
consequence
for
a
man
like
hegel
endowed
with
a
warmly
æsthetic
spirit
and
a
fervid
lover
of
the
arts
almost
a
repetition
of
the
hard
fate
endured
by
plato
but
as
the
greek
philosopher
in
obedience
to
the
presumed
command
of
religion
did
not
hesitate
to
condemn
the
mimetic
art
and
the
homeric
poetry
he
loved
so
the
german
refused
to
evade
the
logical
exigencies
of
his
system
and
proclaimed
the
mortality
nay
the
very
death
of
art
we
have
assigned
he
says
a
very
high
place
to
art
but
it
must
be
recollected
that
neither
in
content
nor
in
form
can
art
be
considered
the
most
perfect
means
of
bringing
before
the
consciousness
of
the
mind
its
true
interests
precisely
by
reason
of
its
form
art
is
limited
to
a
particular
content
only
a
definite
circle
or
grade
of
truth
can
be
made
visible
in
a
work
of
art
that
is
to
say
such
truth
as
may
be
transfused
into
the
sensible
and
adequately
presented
in
that
form
as
were
the
greek
gods
but
there
is
a
deeper
conception
of
truth
by
which
it
is
not
so
intimately
allied
to
the
sensible
as
to
permit
of
its
being
received
or
expressed
suitably
in
material
fashion
to
this
class
belongs
the
christian
conception
of
truth
and
furthermore
the
spirit
of
our
modern
world
more
especially
that
of
our
religion
and
our
mental
evolution
seems
to
have
passed
the
point
at
which
art
is
the
best
road
to
the
apprehension
of
the
absolute
the
peculiar
character
of
artistic
production
no
longer
satisfies
our
highest
aspirations
thought
and
reflexion
have
superseded
fine
art
many
reasons
have
been
adduced
in
order
to
account
for
the
moribund
condition
of
modern
art
in
especial
the
prevalence
of
material
and
political
interests
the
true
reason
says
hegel
consists
of
the
inferiority
in
grade
of
art
in
comparison
with
pure
thought
art
in
its
highest
form
is
and
for
us
must
remain
a
thing
of
the
past
and
just
because
the
thing
has
vanished
one
can
reason
about
it
philosophically
the
æsthetic
of
hegel
is
thus
a
funeral
oration
he
passes
in
review
the
successive
forms
of
art
shows
the
progressive
steps
of
internal
consumption
and
lays
the
whole
in
its
grave
leaving
philosophy
to
write
its
epitaph
romanticism
and
metaphysical
idealism
had
elevated
art
to
such
a
fantastic
height
among
the
clouds
that
at
last
they
were
obliged
to
admit
that
it
was
so
far
away
as
to
be
absolutely
useless

schopenhauer
and
herbart
sidenote
mysticism
in
the
opponents
of
nothing
perhaps
shows
more
clearly
how
well
this
imaginative
conception
of
art
suited
the
spirit
of
the
times
not
only
a
particular
fashion
in
philosophy
but
the
psychological
conditions
expressed
by
the
romantic
movement
than
the
fact
that
the
adversaries
of
the
systems
of
schelling
solger
and
hegel
either
agreed
with
this
conception
in
general
or
while
believing
themselves
to
be
departing
widely
from
it
actually
returned
to
it
involuntarily
sidenote
everybody
knows
with
what
lack
shall
we
say
of
arthur
schopenhauer
fought
against
schelling
hegel
and
all
the
charlatans
and
professors
who
had
divided
amongst
themselves
the
heritage
of
kant
but
what
was
the
artistic
theory
accepted
and
developed
by
schopenhauer
sidenote
as
the
object
of
his
theory
like
hegel
own
turns
upon
the
distinction
between
the
concept
which
is
abstraction
and
the
concept
which
is
concrete
or
idea
although
schopenhauer
ideas
are
by
himself
likened
to
plato
and
in
the
particular
form
in
which
he
presents
them
more
nearly
resemble
those
of
schelling
than
the
idea
of
hegel
they
have
something
in
common
with
intellectual
concepts
for
like
them
they
are
unities
representing
a
plurality
of
real
things
but
the
concept
is
abstract
and
discursive
entirely
indeterminate
in
its
sphere
rigorously
precise
within
its
own
limits
only
the
intellect
suffices
to
conceive
and
understand
it
speech
expresses
it
without
need
for
other
intermediary
and
its
own
definition
exhausts
its
whole
nature
the
idea
on
the
contrary
which
may
be
defined
clearly
as
the
adequate
representative
of
the
concept
is
absolutely
intuitive
and
although
it
represents
an
infinite
number
of
individual
things
it
is
not
for
that
any
the
less
determined
in
all
its
aspects
the
individual
as
individual
can
not
know
it
in
order
to
conceive
it
he
must
strip
himself
of
all
will
of
all
individuality
and
raise
himself
to
the
state
of
a
pure
knowing
subject
the
idea
therefore
is
attained
by
genius
only
or
by
one
who
finds
himself
in
a
genial
disposition
attained
by
that
elevation
of
his
cognitive
powers
inspired
usually
by
genius
the
idea
is
unity
become
plurality
by
means
of
space
and
time
forms
of
one
intuitive
apperception
the
concept
on
the
contrary
is
unity
extracted
from
plurality
by
means
of
abstraction
which
is
the
procedure
of
our
intellect
the
concept
may
be
described
as
post
the
idea
ante
schopenhauer
is
in
the
habit
of
calling
ideas
the
genera
of
things
but
on
one
occasion
he
remarks
that
ideas
are
of
species
not
genera
that
genera
are
simply
concepts
and
that
there
are
natural
species
but
only
logical
genera
this
psychological
illusion
as
to
the
existence
of
ideas
for
types
originates
as
we
find
elsewhere
in
schopenhauer
in
the
habit
of
converting
the
empirical
classifications
of
the
natural
sciences
into
living
realities
do
you
wish
to
see
ideas
he
asks
look
at
the
clouds
which
scud
across
the
sky
look
at
a
brooklet
leaping
over
rocks
look
at
the
crystallization
of
on
a
with
its
designs
of
trees
and
flowers
the
shapes
of
the
clouds
the
ripples
of
the
gushing
brook
the
configurations
of
the
crystals
exist
for
us
individual
observers
in
themselves
they
are
indifferent
the
clouds
in
themselves
are
elastic
vapour
the
brook
is
an
incompressible
fluid
mobile
transparent
amorphous
the
ice
obeys
the
laws
of
crystallization
and
in
these
determinations
their
ideas
consist
all
these
are
the
immediate
objectification
of
will
in
its
various
degrees
and
it
is
these
not
their
pale
copies
in
real
things
that
art
delineates
whence
plato
was
right
in
one
sense
and
wrong
in
another
and
is
justified
and
condemned
by
schopenhauer
exactly
in
the
same
way
as
by
plotinus
of
old
as
well
as
by
worst
enemy
the
modern
schelling
in
consequence
each
art
has
a
special
category
of
ideas
for
its
own
dominion
architecture
and
in
some
cases
hydraulics
facilitate
the
clear
intuition
of
those
ideas
which
constitute
the
lower
degrees
of
objectification
weight
cohesion
resistance
hardness
the
general
properties
of

some
combinations
of
light

most
curious
association
landscape

represent
the
ideas
of
vegetable

and
animal
painting
those
of

historical
painting
and
the
higher
forms
of
sculpture
that
of
the
human
body
poetry
the
very
idea
of
man
himself
as
for
music
that
let
him
who
can
justify
the
logical
discontinuity
is
outside
the
hierarchy
of
the
other
arts
we
have
seen
how
schelling
considered
it
to
be
representative
of
the
very
rhythm
of
the
universe
differing
but
slightly
from
this
schopenhauer
affirms
that
music
does
not
express
ideas
but
parallel
with
ideas
will
itself
the
analogies
between
music
and
the
world
between
the
fundamental
bass
and
crude
matter
between
the
scale
and
the
series
of
species
between
melody
and
conscious
will
led
him
to
the
conclusion
that
music
was
not
as
leibniz
thought
an
arithmetic
but
a
metaphysic
metaphysices

philosophari
sidenote
to
schopenhauer
no
less
than
his
idealistic
predecessors
art
beatifies
it
is
the
flower
of
life
he
who
contemplates
art
is
no
longer
an
individual
but
a
pure
knowing
subject
at
liberty
free
from
desire
from
pain
from
time
sidenote
of
a
better
theory
in
schopenhauer
system
no
doubt
contains
here
and
there
premonitions
of
a
better
and
more
profound
treatment
of
art
schopenhauer
who
was
capable
on
occasion
of
clear
and
keen
analysis
constantly
insists
that
the
forms
of
space
and
time
must
not
be
applied
to
the
idea
or
to
artistic
contemplation
which
admits
of
the
general
form
of
representation
only
from
this
he
might
have
inferred
that
art
so
far
from
being
a
superior
and
extraordinary
level
of
consciousness
is
actually
its
most
immediate
level
namely
that
which
in
its
primitive
simplicity
precedes
even
common
perception
with
its
reference
of
objects
to
a
position
in
the
spatial
and
temporal
series
to
free
oneself
from
common
perception
and
to
live
in
imagination
does
not
mean
rising
to
a
platonic
contemplation
of
the
ideas
but
descending
once
more
into
the
region
of
immediate
intuition
becoming
children
again
as
vico
had
seen
on
the
other
hand
schopenhauer
had
begun
to
examine
the
categories
of
kant
with
an
unprejudiced
eye
he
was
not
satisfied
with
the
two
forms
of
intuition
and
wished
to
add
to
them
a
third
causality
in
conclusion
we
note
that
like
his
predecessors
he
makes
a
comparison
between
art
and
history
with
this
difference
and
advantage
over
the
idealist
authors
of
the
philosophy
of
history
that
for
him
history
was
irreducible
to
concepts
it
was
contemplation
of
the
individual
and
therefore
not
science
had
he
persevered
in
his
comparison
between
art
and
history
he
would
have
arrived
at
a
better
solution
than
that
at
which
he
stopped
that
is
to
say
that
the
matter
of
history
is
the
particular
in
its
particularity
and
contingency
while
that
of
art
is
that
which
is
and
is
always
identical
but
instead
of
pursuing
these
happy
ideas
schopenhauer
preferred
to
play
variations
on
the
themes
fashionable
in
his
day
sidenote
most
astounding
of
all
is
the
fact
that
a
dry
intellectualist
the
avowed
enemy
of
idealism
of
dialectic
and
of
speculative
constructions

in

slightly

how
weightily
he
speaks
when
expounding
his
philosophical
method
æsthetic

not
bear
the
blame
of
the
faults
into
which
metaphysic
has
fallen
we
must
make
it
an
independent
study
and
detach
it
from
all
hypothesis
about
the
universe
nor
must
it
be
confounded
with
psychology
or
asked
to
describe
the
emotions
awakened
by
the
content
of
works
of
art
such
as
the
pathetic
or
the

or

its
duty
is
to
determine

and
beauty
in
the
analysis
of
particular
cases
of
beauty
and
in
registering
what
they
reveal
lies
the
way
of
salvation
these
proposals
and
promises
have
misled
numbers
of
people
as
to
the
nature
of
herbart
æsthetic
but
sont
là
jeux
de
by
paying
attention
we
shall
see
what
herbart
meant
by
analysis
of
particular
case
and
how
he
held
himself
aloof
from
metaphysics
sidenote
beauty
and
relations
of
beauty
for
him
consisted
in
relations
relations
of
tone
colour
line
thought
and
will
experience
must
decide
which
of
these
relations
are
beautiful
and
æsthetic
science
consists
solely
in
enumerating
the
fundamental
concepts
in
which
are
summarized
the
particular
cases
of
beauty
but
these
relations
herbart
thought
were
not
like
physiological
facts
they
could
not
be
empirically
observed
in
a
laboratory
to
correct
this
error
it
is
only
necessary
to
observe
that
these
relations
include
not
only
tones
lines
and
colours
but
also
thoughts
and
will
and
that
they
extend
to
moral
facts
no
less
than
to
objects
of
external
intuition
he
declares
explicitly
no
true
beauty
is
sensible
although
it
frequently
happens
that
precede
and
follow
the
intuition
of
beauty
there
is
a
profound
distinction
between
the
beautiful
and
the
pleasant
for
the
pleasant
needs
no
representation
while
the
beautiful
consists
in
representation
of
relations
followed
immediately
in
consciousness
by
a
judgment
an
appendix
which
expresses
unqualified
approbation
gefällt
and
while
the
pleasant
and
the
unpleasant
in
the
progress
of
culture
gradually
become
transient
and
unimportant
beauty
stands
out
more
and
more
as
something
permanent
and
possessed
of
undeniable
value
the
judgment
of
taste
is
universal
eternal
immutable
the
complete
representation
of
the
same
relations
is
always
followed
by
the
same
judgment
just
as
the
same
cause
always
produces
the
same
effect
this
happens
at
all
times
and
in
all
circumstances
conditions
and
complications
which
gives
to
the
particularity
of
certain
cases
the
appearance
of
a
universal
rule
granted
that
the
elements
of
a
relation
are
universal
concepts
it
is
plain
that
although
in
judging
we
think
only
of
the
content
of
these
concepts
the
judgment
must
have
a
sphere
as
large
as
that
common
to
the
two
concepts
herbart
considers
æsthetic
judgements
as
a
general
class
comprising
ethical
judgements
as
a
subdivision
amongst
other
beauties
is
to
be
distinguished
morality
as
a
thing
not
only
of
value
in
itself
but
as
actually
determining
the
unconditioned
value
of
persons
within
morality
in
the
narrowest
sense
is
distinguished
in
turn
justice
the
five
ethica
ideas
guiding
moral
life
internal
liberty
perfection
benevolence
equity
and
justice
are
five
æsthetic
ideas
or
rather
æsthetic
concepts
applied
to
relations
of
will
sidenote
as
sum
of
content
and
herbart
looks
on
art
as
a
complex
fact
the
combination
of
an
element
content
which
may
have
logical
or
psychological
or
any
other
kind
of
value
and
a
purely
æsthetic
element
form
which
is
an
application
of
the
fundamental
æsthetic
concepts
man
looks
for
that
which
is
diverting
instructive
moving
majestic
ridiculous
and
all
these
are
mingled
with
the
beautiful
in
order
to
procure
favour
and
interest
for
the
work
the
beautiful
thus
assumes
various
complexions
and
becomes
graceful
magnificent
tragic
or
comic
it
can
become
all
these
because
the
æsthetic
judgement
in
itself
calmly
serene
tolerates
the
company
of
the
most
diverse
excitations
of
the
soul
which
are
no
part
of
itself
but
all
these
things
have
nothing
to
do
with
beauty
in
order
to
discover
the
objectively
beautiful
or
ugly
one
must
make
abstraction
from
every
predicate
concerning
the
content
in
order
to
recognize
the
objectively
beautiful
or
ugly
in
poetry
one
must
show
the
difference
between
this
and
that
thought
and
the
discussion
will
concern
itself
with
thoughts
to
recognize
it
in
sculpture
one
must
show
the
difference
between
this
and
that
outline
and
the
discussion
will
turn
upon
outlines
to
recognize
it
in
music
one
should
show
the
difference
between
this
and
that
tone
and
the
discussion
will
turn
upon
tones
now
such
predicates
as
charming
graceful
and
so
forth
contain
nothing
whatever
about
tones
outlines
or
thoughts
and
therefore
tell
us
nothing
about
the
objectively
beautiful
in
poetry
sculpture
or
music
indeed
they
rather
lead
us
to
believe
in
the
existence
of
an
objective
beauty
to
which
thought
outline
or
tone
are
equally
accidental
which
may
be
approached
by
receiving
impressions
from
poetry
sculpture
music
and
so
forth
obliterating
the
object
and
giving
oneself
up
to
the
pure
emotion
of
mind
very
different
is
the
æsthetic
judgement
the
cold
judgement
of
the
connoisseur
who
considers
exclusively
form
objectively
pleasant
formal
relations
this
abstraction
from
the
content
in
order
to
contemplate
pure
form
is
the
catharsis
produced
by
art
content
is
transitory
relative
subject
to
moral
law
and
liable
to
moral
judgement
form
is
permanent
absolute

concrete
art
may
be
the
sum
of
two
or
more
values
but
the
æsthetic

alone
sidenote
and
kantian
the
reader
who
goes
behind
appearances
and
discounts
diversities
of
terminology
will
not
fail
to
observe
the
close
similarity
of
the
æsthetic
doctrine
of
herbart
to
that
of
kant
in
herbart
we
again
find
the
distinction
between
free
and
adherent
beauty
and
between
form
and
the
sensuous
stimulus
attached
to
form
we
find
an
affirmation
of
the
existence
of
pure
beauty
the
object
of
necessary
and
universal
but
not
discursive
judgements
lastly
we
find
a
certain
connexion
between
beauty
and
morality
between
æsthetic
and
ethics
in
these
matters
herbart
is
perhaps
the
most
faithful
follower
and
propagator
of
the
thought
of
kant
whose
doctrine
contains
the
germ
of
his
own
in
one
passage
he
describes
himself
as
a
kantian
but
of
the
year
and
he
is
quite
right
even
in
pointing
out
the
exact
difference
in
date
amidst
the
errors
and
uncertainties
of
his
æsthetic
thought
kant
is
rich
in
suggestion
and
scatters
fertile
seed
he
belongs
to
a
period
when
philosophy
was
still
young
and
impressionable
herbart
coming
later
is
dry
and
he
takes
whatever
is
false
in
kant
doctrine
and
hardens
it
into
a
system
if
they
had
done
little
else
the
romanticists
and
idealists
had
at
least
united
the
theory
of
beauty
to
that
of
art
and
destroyed
the
rhetorical
and
mechanical
view
and
they
had
brought
into
relief
frequently
exaggerating
doubtless
various
important
characteristics
of
artistic
activity
herbart
the
mechanical
view
restores
the
duality
and
presents
a
capricious
narrow
barren
mysticism
devoid
of
all
breath
of
artistic
feeling

meaning
of
the
we
have
now
reached
a
point
when
we
are
able
to
give
ourselves
an
exact
account
of
the
signification
and
importance
of
the
celebrated
war
waged
for
over
a
century
in
germany
between
the
æsthetic
of
content
and
the
æsthetic
of
form
a
war
which
gave
birth
to
vast
works
on
the
history
of
æsthetic
undertaken
from
one
or
other
point
of
view
and
sprang
from
herbart
opposition
to
the
idealism
of
schelling
hegel
and
their
contemporaries
and
followers
form
and
content
are
among
the
most
equivocal
words
in
the
whole
philosophical
vocabulary
particularly
in
æsthetic
sometimes
indeed
what
one
calls
form
others
call
content
the
herbartians
were
specially
given
to
quoting
in
their
own
defence
schiller
dictum
that
the
secret
of
art
consists
in
cancelling
content
by
form
but
what
is
there
in
common
between
concept
of
form
which
placed
the
æsthetic
activity
side
by
side
with
the
moral
and
intellectual
and
herbart
form
which
does
not
penetrate
or
enliven
but
clothes
and
adorns
a
content
hegel
on
the
other
hand
often
gives
the
name
form
to
what
schiller
would
call
matter
that
is
the
sensible
matter
which
it
is
the
business
of
spiritual
energy
to
dominate
hegel
content
is
the
idea
the
metaphysical
truth
the
constituent
element
of
beauty
herbart
content
is
the
emotional
and
intellectual
element
which
falls
outside
beauty
the
æsthetic
of
form
in
italy
is
an
æsthetic
of
expressive
activity
the
form
is
neither
a
clothing
nor
a
metaphysical
idea
nor
sensible
matter
but
a
representative
or
imaginative
faculty
with
the
power
of
framing
impressions
yet
there
have
been
attempts
to
confute
this
italian
æsthetic
formalism
with
the
same
arguments
that
are
used
against
german
æsthetic
formalism
a
totally
different
thing
in
every
respect
and
so
forth
having
given
a
plain
account
of
the
thoughts
of
the
æstheticians
we
shall
be
able
to
appreciate
their
opponents
without
seeking
light
from
their
obscure
terminology
or
allowing
ourselves
to
be
misled
by
the
banners
they
wave
the
antithesis
between
the
æsthetic
of
content
and
that
of
form
the
æsthetic
of
idealism
and
that
of
realism
the
æsthetic
of
schelling
solger
hegel
and
schopenhauer
and
that
of
herbart
will
appear
in
its
true
light
as
the
lamily
quarrel
between
two
conceptions
of
art
united
by
a
common
mysticism
although
one
is
destined
almost
to
meet
with
truth
during
its
long
journey
while
the
other
wanders
ever
further
away
the
first
half
of
the
nineteenth

was

this
uproar
in
which
the
men
shouted
down
the
and
made
good
their
claim
to
their
only
true
property
namely
words
it
is
not
surprising
that
a
few
modest
clear
thinkers
philosophers
who
preferred
to
think
about
realities
should
have
the
worst
of
it
and
remain
unheard
and
unnoticed
lost
among
the
roaring
crowd
or
labelled
with
a
false
ticket
sidenote
this
at
least
seems
to
have
been
the
lot
of
friedrich
schleiermacher
whose
æsthetic
doctrine
is
amongst
the
least
known
although
it
is
perhaps
the
most
noteworthy
of
the
day
sidenote
judgements
concerning
schleiermacher
delivered
his
first
lectures
on
æsthetic
at
berlin
university
in
and
from
that
date
he
began
to
study
the
subject
seriously
with
a
view
to
writing
a
book
on
it
he
repeated
his
lectures
on
two
occasions
in
and
but
his
death
which
occurred
in
the
following
year
prevented
him
from
carrying
out
his
plan
and
all
we
know
of
his
thoughts
on
æsthetic
comes
from
his
lectures
as
collected
by
his
pupils
and
published
in
a
herbartian
historian
of
æsthetic
zimmermann
attacks
the
posthumous
work
of
schleiermacher
with
real
ferocity
after
twenty
pages
of
invective
and
sarcasm
he
concludes
by
asking
how
could
his
pupils
so
dishonour
their
great
master
by
publishing
such
a
mass
of
waste
paper
all
play
upon
words
sophistical
conceits
and
dialectical
subtleties
nor
was
the
idealistic
historian
hartmann
much
more
benevolent
when
he
describes
the
work
as
a
confused
mess
in
which
among
much
that
is
merely
trivial
many
and
exaggerations
one
can
detect
a
few
acute
observations
and
says
that
in
order
to
make
bearable
such
unctuous
afternoon
sermons
delivered
by
a
preacher
in
his
dotage
it
must
be
shortened
by
and
that
as
regards
fundamental
principles
it
is
simply
useless
offering
no
innovations
upon
concrete
idealism
as
presented
by
hegel
and
others
and
that
in
any
case
it
seems
impossible
to
attach
it
to
any
line
of
thought
except
the
hegelian
to
which
contribution
is
only
of
importance
he
further
observes
that
schleiermacher
was
primarily
a
theologian
and
in
philosophy
more
or
less
an
amateur
now
it
can
not
be
denied
that
doctrine
has
reached
us
in
a
hazy
form
by
no
means
free
from
uncertainties
and
contradictions
and
which
is
more
important
it
is
here
and
there
affected
for
the
worse
by
the
influence
of
contemporary
metaphysics
but
side
by
side
with
these
defects
what
excellent
method
really
scientific
and
philosophical
what
a
number
of
cornerstones
well
and
truly
laid
what
wealth
of
new
truths
and
of
difficulties
and
problems
not
suspected
or
discussed
before
his
day
sidenote
contrasted
with
his
schleiermacher
considered
æsthetic
as
an
essentially
modern
line
of
thought
and
drew
a
sharp
distinction
between
the
of
aristotle
which
never
shakes
itself
free
from
the
empirical
standpoint
of
the
maker
of
rules
and
what
baumgarten
tried
to
do
in
the
eighteenth
century
he
praised
kant
for
having
been
the
first
truly
to
include
æsthetic
among
the
philosophical
sciences
and
recognized
that
in
hegel
artistic
activity
had
attained
the
highest
elevation
by
being
brought
into
connexion
and
almost
into
equality
with
religion
and
philosophy
but
he
was
not
satisfied
either
with
the
followers
of
baumgarten
when
they
degenerated
into
the
absurd
attempt
to
construct
a
science
or
theory
of
sensuous
pleasure
or
with
the
kantian
point
of
view
which
made
its
principal
aim
the
consideration
of
taste
or
with
the
philosophy
of
fichte
in
which
art
became
a
means
of
education
or
with
the
more
widely
received
opinion
which
placed
at
the
centre
of
æsthetic
the
vague
and
equivocal
concept
of
beauty
schiller
pleased
him
by
having
called
attention
to
the
moment
of
artistic
spontaneity
or
productiveness
and
he
praised
schelling
for
having
laid
stress
on
the
importance
of
the
figurative
arts
which
lend
themselves
less
easily
than
poetry
to
facile
and
illusory
moralistic
interpretations
having
with
the
utmost
clearness
excluded
from
æsthetic
the
study
of
practical
rules
as
empirical
and
therefore
irreducible
to
a
science
he
assigned
to
æsthetic
the
task
of
determining
the
proper
position
of
artistic
activity
in
the
scheme
of
ethics
sidenote
assigned
to
æsthetic
in
his
to
avoid
falling
into
error
over
this
terminology
we
must
call
to
mind
that
the
philosophy
of
schleiermacher
followed
the
ancient
traditions
in
its
tripartite
division
into
dialectic
ethics
and
physics
dialectic
corresponds
with
ontology
physics
embraces
all
the
sciences
of
natural
facts
ethics
includes
the
study
of
all
free
activities
of
mankind
language
thought
art
religion
and
morality
ethics
represented
to
him
not
only
the
science
of
morality
but
what
others
name
psychology
or
better
still
the
science
or
philosophy
of
the
spirit
this
explanation
once
given
schleiermacher
point
of
departure
seems
to
be
the
only
one
just
and
permissible
and
we
shall
not
be
surprised
when
he
talks
of
will
of
voluntary
acts
and
so
on
where
others
would
have
simply
spoken
of
activity
or
spiritual
energy
he
even
endows
such
expressions
with
a
broader
meaning
than
that
conferred
upon
them
by
practical
philosophy
sidenote
activity
as
immanent
and
a
double
distinction
may
be
made
amongst
human
activities
in
the
first
place
there
are
activities
which
we
presume
to
be
constituted
in
the
same
manner
in
all
men
such
as
the
logical
activity
and
are
called
activities
of
identity
and
others
whose
diversity
is
presumed
which
are
called
activities
of
difference
or
individual
activities
secondly
there
are
activities
which
exhaust
themselves
in
the
internal
life
and
others
which
actualize
themselves
in
the
external
world
immanent
activities
and
practical
activities
to
which
of
the
two
classes
in
each
of
the
two
orders
does
artistic
activity
belong
there
can
be
no
doubt
of
its
different
modes
of
development
if
not
actually
in
each
individual
person
at
least
in
different
peoples
and
nations
therefore
it
belongs
properly
to
activities
of
difference
or
individual
activities
as
for
the
other
distinction
it
is
true
that
art
does
realize
itself
in
the
external
world
but
this
fact
is
something
superadded
später
which
stands
to
the
internal
fact
as
the
communication
of
thought
by
means
of
speech
or
writing
stands
to
thought
itself
art
true
work
is
the
internal
image
innere
bild
ist
das
eigentliche
exceptions
to
this
might
be
adduced
such
as
mimicry
but
they
would
be
apparent
only
between
a
really
angry
man
and
the
actor
who
plays
the
part
of
an
angry
man
on
the
stage
there
is
this
difference
in
the
second
case
anger
appears
as
controlled
and
therefore
beautiful
that
is
the
internal
image
is
in
the
actor
soul
interposed
between
the
fact
of
passion
and
its
physical
manifestation
artistic
activity
belongs
to
those
human
activities
in
which
we
presuppose
the
individual
in
its
differentiation
it
belongs
equally
to
those
activities
developing
essentially
within
themselves
and
not
completing
themselves
in
any
external
world
art
therefore
is
an
immanent
activity
in
which
we
presuppose
differentiation
internal
not
practical
individual
not
universal
or
logical
sidenote
truth
and
intellectual
but
if
art
be
one
form
of
thought
there
must
be
one
form
of
thought
in
which
identity
is
presupposed
and
another
in
which
difference
is
presupposed
we
do
not
look
for
truth
in
poetry
or
rather
we
do
look
for
truth
but
for
one
that
is
totally
different
from
that
objective
truth
to
which
there
must
correspond
some
being
either
universal
or
individual
scientific
and
historical
truth
when
a
character
in
a
poem
is
said
to
be
devoid
of
truth
a
slur
is
cast
on
the
given
poem
but
if
the
character
is
said
to
be
a
pure
invention
corresponding
with
no
reality
that
is
quite
a
different
matter
the
truth
of
a
poetic
character
consists
in
the
coherence
with
which
a
single
person
divers
modes
of
thinking
and
acting
are
represented
even
in
portraits
it
is
not
an
exact
correspondence
with
an
objective
reality
that
makes
the
thing
a
work
of
art
from
art
and
poetry
springs
no
iota
of
knowledge
geringste
vom
it
expresses
but
the
truth
of
the
single
consciousness
there
are
then
productions
of
thought
and
of
sensible
intuitions
opposed
to
the
other
productions
because
they
do
not
presuppose
identity
and
they
express
the
singular
as
such
sidenote
of
artistic
consciousness
from
feeling
and
the
domain
of
art
is
immediate
which
must
be
carefully
distinguished
from
the
thought
or
concept
of
the
ego
or
of
the
determinate
ego
this
latter
is
the
consciousness
of
identity
in
the
diversity
of
moments
immediate
is
diversity
itself
of
which
one
must
be
aware
since
life
in
its
entirety
is
but
the
development
of
consciousness
in
this
domain
art
has
often
been
confused
with
two
facts
which
accompany
it
sensuous
consciousness
the
feeling
of
pleasure
and
pain
and
religion
a
double
confusion
of
which
the
sensationalists
fall
into
the
first
half
and
hegel
into
the
second
schleiermacher
clears
it
up
by
proving
that
art
is
free
productivity
whereas
sensuous
pleasure
and
religious
feeling
however
different
in
other
ways
are
both
determined
by
an
objective
fact
sidenote
and
art
inspiration
and
the
better
to
understand
this
free
productivity
we
must
further
circumscribe
the
domain
of
immediate
consciousness
in
this
we
can
find
nothing
more
helpful
than
comparing
it
with
the
images
produced
by
dreams
the
artist
has
his
own
dreams
he
dreams
with
open
eyes
and
from
among
the
images
of
this
those
having
sufficient
energy
alone
become
works
of
art
the
rest
remaining
a
mere
background
from
which
the
others
stand
out
all
the
essential
elements
of
art
are
found
in
the
which
is
the
production
of
free
thoughts
and
sensuous
intuitions
consisting
of
mere
images
certainly
something
is
lacking
in
dreams
and
they
differ
from
art
not
only
in
their
absence
of
technique
which
has
already
been
excluded
as
irrelevant
to
art
but
in
another
way
viz
that
a
dream
is
a
chaotic
fact
without
stability
order
connexion
or
measure
but
when
some
sort
of
order
is
introduced
into
the
chaos
the
difference
at
once
disappears
and
the
likeness
to
art
merges
in
identity
this
internal
activity
which
introduces
order
and
measure
fixes
and
determines
the
image
is
that
which
distinguishes
art
from
a
dream
or
transforms
a
dream
into
art
it
often
involves
struggle
labour
the
obligation
to
stem
the
involuntary
flood
of
internal
images
in
a
word
it
means
reflexion
or
deliberation
but
the
dream
and
the
cessation
of
dreaming
are
equally
indispensable
elements
of
art
there
must
be
production
of
thoughts
and
images
and
together
with
such
production
there
must
be
measure
determination
and
unity
otherwise
each
image
would
be
confused
with
its
neighbour
and
have
no
definiteness
the
instant
of
inspiration
is
as
essential
as
that
of
deliberation
sidenote
and
the
but
in
order
to
arrive
at
artistic
truth
it
is
also
i
necessary
here
schleiermacher
thought
becomes
less
clear
and
accurate
that
the
singular
be
accompanied
by
consciousness
of
the
species
consciousness
of
the
self
as
individual
man
is
impossible
without
consciousness
of
mankind
nor
is
a
single
object
true
unless
referred
to
its
universal
in
a
pictured
landscape
every
tree
must
possess
natural
truth
that
is
to
say
it
must
be
contemplated
as
a
specimen
of
a
given
kind
similarly
the
whole
complex
of
natural
and
individual
life
must
have
effective
truth
of
nature
and
constitute
a
single
harmony
just
because
in
art
we
do
not
strive
after
the
production
of
individual
figures
in
themselves
and
for
themselves
but
their
internal
truth
as
well
we
commonly
assign
to
them
a
high
place
as
being
a
free
realization
of
that
in
which
all
cognition
has
its
value
that
is
to
say
in
the
principle
that
all
forms
of
being
are
inherent
in
the
human
spirit
if
this
principle
fails
truth
is
no
longer
possible
scepticism
only
remains
the
productions
of
art
are
the
ideal
or
typical
figures
which
real
nature
would
create
were
it
not
impeded
by
external
influences
the
artist
creates
a
figure
on
the
basis
of
a
general
scheme
rejecting
whatever
may
hinder
or
impede
the
play
of
the
living
forces
of
reality
such
a
production
founded
on
a
general
scheme
is
what
we
call
the
ideal
in
spite
of
all
these
determinations
schleiermacher
did
not
apparently
intend
to
limit
the
artist
scope
he
remarks
when
an
artist
represents
something
really
given
whether
portrait
landscape
or
single
human
figure
he
renounces
the
freedom
of
productivity
and
adheres
to
the
real
there
is
a
twofold
tendency
at
work
in
the
artist
towards
perfection
of
type
and
towards
representation
of
natural
reality
an
artist
must
not
fall
into
the
abstractness
of
the
type
or
into
the
unmeaningness
of
empirical
reality
if
in
it
is
necessary
to
bring
out
the
specific
type
a
much
more
complete
individualisation
is
demanded
when
representing
man
owing
to
the
lofty
position
which
he
occupies
representation
of
the
ideal
in
the
real
does
not
exclude
an
infinite
variety
such
as
is
found
in
actual
reality
for
instance
the
human
face
wavers
between
the
ideal
and
caricature
in
its
moral
conformation
no
less
than
in
its
physical
every
human
face
contains
elements
of
disfigurement
but
it
has
also
something
by
which
it
is
a
determinate
modification
of
human
nature
this
does
not
appear
openly
but
a
practised
eye
can
seize
it
and
ideally
complete
the
face
in
question
schleiermacher
is
keenly
aware
of
the
difficulties
and
perplexities
of
such
problems
as
the
question
whether
there
exists
one
or
many
ideals
of
the
human
face
he
observes
that
the
two
views
which
strive
for
mastery
in
the
field
of
poetry
may
be
extended
to
art
as
a
whole
some
assert
that
poetry
and
art
should
represent
the
perfect
the
ideal
that
which
would
have
been
produced
by
nature
had
she
not
been
prevented
by
mechanical
forces
others
reject
the
ideal
as
incapable
of
realisation
and
prefer
that
the
artist
should
depict
man
as
he
really
is
with
those
perturbing
elements
which
in
reality
belong
to
him
no
less
than
his
ideal
qualities
each
view
is
a
it
is
the
duty
of
art
to
represent
the
ideal
as
well
as
the
real
the
subjective
as
well
as
the
objective
the
comic
element
that
is
the
unideal
and
the
faulty
ideal
is
included
in
the
circle
of
art
sidenote
of
in
respect
to
morality
art
is
free
just
as
philosophical
speculation
is
free
its
essence
excludes
practical
and
moral
effects
this
leads
to
the
proposition
that
there
is
no
difference
between
various
works
of
art
except
in
so
far
as
they
can
be
compared
in
respect
of
artistic
perfection
in
der
given
an
artistic
object
perfect
of
its
kind
it
has
an
absolute
value
which
can
not
be
increased
or
diminished
by
anything
else
if
motions
of
the
will
could
truly
be
described
as
consequences
of
works
of
art
a
different
standard
of
values
would
apply
to
works
of
art
and
since
the
objects
which
an
artist
may
depict
are
not
all
equally
adapted
to
influence
volition
a
scale
of
values
would
exist
which
did
not
depend
on
artistic
perfection
nor
must
we
confound
the
judgement
passed
upon
the
varied
and
complex
personality
of
the
artist
himself
with
the
strictly
æsthetic
judgement
passed
upon
his
work
in
this
respect
the
biggest
most
complicated
canvas
is
on
a
level
with
the
smallest
arabesque
the
longest
poem
with
the
shortest
the
value
of
a
work
of
art
depends
on
the
perfect
manner
in
which
the
external
corresponds
to
the
internal
schleiermacher
rejects
the
doctrine
of
schiller
because
in
his
opinion
it
makes
art
a
sort
of
game
or
pastime
in
contrast
to
the
serious
affairs
of
life
a
view
he
says
for
business
men
to
whom
their
business
is
the
only
serious
thing
artistic
activity
is
universally
human
a
man
devoid
of
it
is
inconceivable
although
of
course
there
are
in
this
respect
great
differences
betwixt
man
and
man
running
from
the
mere
desire
to
enjoy
art
to
real
taste
and
from
this
again
to
productive
genius
sidenote
and
the
artist
makes
use
of
instruments
which
by
their
nature
are
framed
not
for
the
individual
but
for
the
universal
of
this
kind
is
language
but
it
is
the
business
of
poetry
to
extract
the
individual
from
language
which
is
universal
without
giving
to
its
productions
the
form
of
the
antithesis
between
individual
and
universal
which
is
proper
to
science
of
the
two
elements
of
language
the
musical
and
the
logical
the
poet
claims
the
first
for
his
own
ends
and
constrains
the
other
to
awaken
individual
images
in
comparison
with
pure
science
as
in
comparison
with
the
individual
image
there
is
something
irrational
about
language
but
the
tendencies
of
speculation
and
of
poetry
are
always
contrary
even
in
their
use
of
language
the
former
tends
to
make
language
approximate
to
mathematical
formulæ
the
latter
to
imagery
sidenote
leaving
out
many
details
which
will
be
touched
on
in
their
proper
places
the
foregoing
is
a
fair
summary
of
the
heads
of
schleiermacher
æsthetic
thought
adding
up
the
accounts
of
the
whole
statement
of
views
on
the
side
of
error
and
oversight
we
find
first
ideas
or
types
are
not
wholly
excluded
in
spite
of
all
schleiermacher
care
and
anxiety
to
safeguard
artistic
individualisation
and
to
make
the
ideas
and
types
superfluous
secondly
there
is
still
undefeated
and
unexpelled
a
certain
residue
of
abstract
formalism
visible
at
various
points
of
his
theories
thirdly
the
definition
of
art
as
an
activity
of
mere
difference
may
be
diluted
but
is
not
destroyed
by
making
art
a
difference
of
complexes
of
individuals
a
national
difference
a
closer
reflexion
on
the
history
of
art
a
recognition
of
the
possibility
of
appreciating
the
art
of
various
nations
and
various
times
a
more
patient
investigation
into
the
moment
of
artistic
reproduction
even
an
examination
of
the
relation
between
science
and
art
would
have
led
schleiermacher
to
treat
this
difference
as
empirical
and
surmountable
still
holding
firmly
to
the
distinctive
character
individual
as
opposed
to
universal
he
assigned
to
art
in
comparison
with
science
fourthly
he
did
not
recognize
the
identity
of
æsthetic
activity
with
linguistic
and
failed
to
make
it
the
basis
of
all
other
theoretic
activity
it
would
seem
moreover
that
schleiermacher
had
no
clear
ideas
concerning
that
artistic
element
which
enters
into
the
constitution
of
historic
narrative
and
is
indispensable
as
the
concrete
form
of
science
or
concerning
language
taken
not
as
a
complex
of
abstract
means
of
expression
but
as
expressive
activity
sidenote
services
to
these
defects
and
uncertainties
may
perhaps
be
attributable
in
part
to
the
fact
that
his
thoughts
on
æsthetic
have
reached
us
in
an
inchoate
form
very
far
from
a
mature
development
but
if
on
the
other
hand
we
wish
to
cast
up
the
sum
of
his
very
striking
merits
it
will
suffice
to
run
over
the
list
of
accusations
heaped
upon
him
by
the
two
historians
before
mentioned
zimmermann
and
hartmann
schleiermacher
has
denuded
æsthetic
of
its
imperative
character
he
recognizes
in
it
a
form
of
thought
differing
from
logical
thought
he
gives
this
science
a
and
merely
anthropological
character
he
denies
the
concept
of
beauty
substituting
that
of
artistic
perfection
and
actually
affirms
the
æsthetic
equivalence
of
small
and
great
works
of
art
so
long
as
each
is
perfect
in
its
own
sphere
he
considers
the
æsthetic
fact
as
pure
human
productivity
and
so
on
and
so
forth
all
these
criticisms
are
meant
for
blame
and
are
really
praise
for
what
is
blame
to
the
mind
of
a
zimmermann
or
a
hartmann
is
to
ours
praise
in
the
metaphysical
orgy
of
his
day
in
the
perpetual
building
and
pulling
down
of
more
or
less
arbitrary
systems
schleiermacher
the
theologian
with
philosophic
acumen
fixed
his
eye
upon
what
was
really
characteristic
of
the
æsthetic
fact
and
succeeded
in
defining
its
properties
and
connexions
when
he
failed
to
see
clearly
and
wandered
from
the
track
he
never
abandoned
analysis
for
fantastic
caprice
by
his
discovery
that
the
obscure
region
of
immediate
consciousness
is
also
that
of
the
æsthetic
fact
he
seems
to
bid
his
distracted
contemporaries
listen

old

of
about
the
time
when
schleiermacher
was
meditating
on
the
nature
of
the
æsthetic

a
movement
of
thought
was
gaining
ground
in
germany
which
tending
as
it
did
to
overthrow
the
old
concept
of

might
have
proved
a

but
not

had
the
æsthetic
specialists
if
we
may
so
call
them
no
notion
of
the
existence
of
this
movement
the
new
philosophers
of
language
never
brought
their
ideas
into

with

æsthetic
problem
and
their
discoveries
languished
imprisoned

narrow
scope
of

of

nineteenth
research
into
the
relations
between

and

unity
of

and
the
multiplicity
of
languages
had
been
promoted
like
many
other
things

the
of

the
earliest
kantians
often
tried
to
apply
the
kantian
categories
of

and
of

to

the
first
to
make
the
attempt
was
roth
in

wrote
an
essay
twenty
years
later
on
many
other
noteworthy
books
on

were
published
one
after
another
in
the
first
ten
years
of
the
nineteenth
century
in
all
these
treatises
the
dominating
subject
is
the
difference
between
language
and
languages
between
the
universal
language
corresponding
with
logic
and
concrete
historical

disturbed

which
attempts
by
means
of
induction
to
reach
probable
laws
through
the
study
of

bemhardi
considers
language
to
be
an
allegory
of
intellect
and
distinguishes
it
as
functioning
either
as
the
organ
of
poetry
or

koch
more
energetic
than

others
asserts
positively
that

some
few
philosophers
speculated
on
language
and

for
example
schelling
considered
them
to
be
the
products
of
a
consciousness

in

von

even
the
famous
philologist
wilhelm
von
humboldt
was
unable
to
detach
himself
entirely
from
the
prejudice
of
the
substantial
identity
and
the
purely
historical
accidental
diversity
between
logical
thought
and
language
his
celebrated
dissertation
the
diversity
of
structure
of
human
is
based
on
the
notion
of
a
perfect
language
split
up
and
distributed
amongst
particular
tongues
according
to
the
linguistic
or
intellectual
capacity
of
various
nations
for
says
he
since
disposition
towards
speech
is
general
in
mankind
and
all
men
must
necessarily
carry
within
themselves
the
key
to
the
comprehension
of
all
languages
it
follows
that
the
form
of
all
languages
must
be
substantially
equal
and
all
must
attain
the
same
general
end
diversity
can
exist
solely
in
the
means
and
within
the
bounds
permitted
by
the
attainment
of
the
end
yet
this
same
diversity
becomes
a
real
divergence
not
only
in
sounds
but
in
the
use
of
sound
made
by
the
linguistic
sense
in
respect
to
the
form
of
language
or
rather
in
respect
to
its
own
idea
of
the
form
of
the
determinate
language
languages
being
merely
formal
the
operation
of
the
linguistic
sense
by
itself
should
produce
mere
uniformity
the
linguistic
sense
must
exact
from
every
tongue
the
same
right
and
legitimate
construction
that
is
found
in
one
of
them
in
practice
however
the
facts
are
quite
otherwise
partly
owing
to
the
reaction
of
sounds
and
partly
by
reason
of
the
individual
aspect
assumed
by
the
same
internal
meaning
in
phenomenal
reality
linguistic
force
can
not
maintain
its
equality
everywhere
or
show
the
same
intensity
vivacity
or
regularity
it
can
not
be
supported
by
an
exactly
equal
tendency
towards
the
symbolic
treatment
of
thought
or
by
exactly
equal
pleasure
in
richness
and
harmony
of
sound
these
then
are
the
causes
which
produce
in
human
languages
that
diversity
which
manifests
itself
in
every
branch
of
the
civilization
of
nations
but
reflexion
on
languages
ought
to
reveal
to
us
a
form
which
of
all
possible
forms
best
fits
the
purpose
of
language
and
approaches
most
closely
to
its
ideal
and
the
merits
and
defects
of
existing
languages
must
be
estimated
by
their
nearness
or
remoteness
from
this
form
humboldt
finds
the
nearest
approximation
to
such
an
ideal
in
the
sanskrit
tongues
which
can
therefore
be
used
as
a
standard
of
comparison
setting
chinese
apart
in
a
class
by
itself
he
proceeds
to
the
division
of
the
possible
forms
of
language
into
inflective
agglutinative
and
incorporative
types
which
are
found
combined
in
various
proportions
in
every
real
language
he
also
inaugurated
the
division
of
languages
into
inferior
and
superior
unformed
and
formed
according
to
the
way
in
which
verbs
are
treated
he
was
never
able
to
rid
himself
of
a
second
prejudice
connected
with
the
first
namely
that
language
exists
as
something
objective
outside
the
talking
man

and
independent

but
humboldt
opposes
humboldt
amongst
the
old
dross
we
detect
the
brilliant
gleams
of
a
wholly
new
concept
of
language
certainly
his
work
is
for
this
very
reason
not
always
free
from
contradictions
and
from
a
kind
of
hesitation
and
awkwardness
which
appear
characteristically
in
his
literary
style
and
make
it
at
times
laboured
and
obscure
the
new
man
in
humboldt
criticizes
the
old
man
when
he
says
languages
must
be
considered
not
as
dead
products
but
as
an
act
of
production
language
in
its
reality
is
something
continually
changing
and
passing
away
even
its
preservation
in
writing
is
incomplete
a
kind
of
mummification
it
is
always
necessary
to
render
the
living
speech
sensible
language
is
not
a
work
but
an
activity
it
is
an
eternally
repeated
effort
of
the
spirit
in
order
to
make
articulated
tones
capable
of
expressing
thought
language
is
the
act
of
speaking
true
and
proper
language
consists
in
the
very
act
of
producing
it
by
means
of
connected
utterance
that
is
the
only
thing
that
must
be
thought
of
as
the
or
the
truth
in
any
inquiry
which
aims
at
penetrating
into
the
living
essence
of
language
division
into
words
and
rules
is
a
lifeless
artifice
of
scientific
analysis
language
is
not
a
thing
arising
out
of
the
need
of
external
communication
on
the
contrary
it
springs
from
the
wholly
internal
thirst
for
knowledge
and
the
struggle
to
reach
an
intuition
of
things
from
its
earliest
commencement
it
is
entirely
human
and
extends
without
intention
to
all
objects

sensory
perception
or
internal
elaboration

humboldt
to
discover
a
fact
hidden
from
the
authors
of

namely
the
internal
form
of
language
which
is
neither
logical

humboldt
was
content
to
regard
the
procedure
of
artist
and
speaker
as
comparable
by
analogy
without
proceeding
to
identify
them
on
the
one
hand
he
was
too
in
his
view
of
language
as
a
means
for
the
development
of
thought
logical
thought
on
the
other
his
own
æsthetic
ideas
always
vague
and
not
always
true
prevented
his
perception
of
the
identity
of
his
two
principal
writings
on
æsthetic
that
on
masculine
and
seems
to
be
wholly
under
the
influence
of
winckelmann
whose
antithesis
between
beauty
and
expression
is
revived
and
the
opinion
expressed
that
specific
sexual
characters
diminish
the
beauty
of
the
human
body
and
that
beauty
asserts
itself
only
by
triumphing
over
differences
of
sex
his
other
work
which
is
inspired
by
goethe
und
dorothee
defines
art
as
representation
of
nature
by
means
of
fancy
the
representation
being
beautiful
just
because
it
is
the
work
of
fancy
a
metamorphosis
of
nature
carried
to
a
higher
sphere
the
poet
reflects
the
pictures
of
language
itself
a
complex
of
abstractions
in
his
dissertation
on
linguistic
humboldt
distinguishes
poetry
and
prose
treating
the
two
concepts
philosophically
not
by
the
empirical
distinction
between
free
and
measured
or
periodic
and
metric
language
poetry
gives
us
reality
in
its
sensible
appearance
as
it
is
felt
internally
and
externally
but
is
indifferent
to
the
character
which
makes
it
real
and
even
deliberately
ignores
that
character
it
presents
the
sensuous
appearance
to
fancy
and
by
this
means
leads
towards
the
contemplation
of
an
artistically
ideal
whole
prose
on
the
contrary
looks
in
reality
for
the
roots
which
attach
it
to
existence
the
cords
which
bind
her
to
it
hence
it
fastens
fact
to
fact
and
concept
to
concept
according
to
the
methods
of
the
intellect
and
strives
towards
the
objective
union
of
them
all
in
an
idea
poetry
precedes
prose
before
producing
prose
the
spirit
necessarily
forms
itself
in
poetry
but
beside
these
views
some
of
which
are
profoundly
true
humboldt
looks
on
poets
as
perfecters
of
language
and
on
poetry
as
belonging
only
to
certain
exceptional
moments
and
makes
us
suspect
that
after
all
he
never
recognized
clearly
or
maintained
firmly
that
language
is
always
poetry
and
that
prose
science
is
a
distinction
not
of
æsthetic
form

of

the

to
psychology

logical

pledged
himself
to
deduce
the
entire

of
the
sanskrit
languages
from
twelve
cardinal
concepts
steinthal
declares
it
is
not
true
that
one
can
not
think
without
words
the
thinks
in
signs
the
mathematician
in

in
some

as
in
chinese
the
visual

is
as
necessary
to

as
the
phonetic

not
more
so
in
this
he
may
have
overshot
the
mark
and
failed
to
establish
the
autonomy
of

to
logical
thought
for
his
examples
only
confirm
the
fact
that
if
we
can
think
without
words
we
can
not
think
without
expressions
but
he
successfully
demonstrates
that
concept
and
word
logical
judgement
and
proposition
are
incommensurable
the
proposition
is
not
the
judgement
but
the
representation
of
a
judgement
and
all
propositions
do
not
represent
logical
judgements
it
is
possible
to
express
several
judgements
in
a
single
proposition
the
logical
divisions
of

the
relations
of

find
no
counterpart
in
the
grammatical
divisions
of

a
logical
form
of

is
just
as

a
contradiction
as

the
problems
of
the
origin
and
the
nature
of
having
thus
freed

from

dependence
on

repeatedly
proclaimed
the
principle
that
language
produces
its

independently

fullest
autonomy

origin
of

with
his

that
the
question
of
its
origin
is
identical
with
that
of

of

its
psychological
genesis
or
rather
the
position
it
occupies
in
evolution
of
the
spirit
in
the
matter
of
language
there
is
no
difference
between
its
original
creation
and
the
creation
which
is
daily
repeated
language
belongs
to
the
vast
class
of
reflex
movements
but
to
say
that
is
to
look
at
it
from
one
side
only
and
to
omit
its
own
essential
peculiarity
animals
have
reflex
movements
and
sensations
like
man
but
in
animals
the
senses
are
wide
gates
through
which
external
nature
rushes
to
the
assault
with
such
impetus
as
to
overwhelm
the
mind
and
deprive
it
of
all
independence
and
freedom
of
movement
in
man
however
language
can
arise
because
man
is
resistance
to
nature
conqueror
of
his
own

freedom
incarnate
language
is
liberation
even
we
feel
our
mind
lightened
and
freed
from
a
weight
when
we
speak
in
the
situation
immediately
preceding
the
production
of

man
must
be
conceived
as
accompanying
all
his

all
the

received
by

most
lively
contortions

what
element

did
he

a
most
important
one
the
conscious

mistaken
ideas
on

his
failure
to
unite
linguistic
and
this
is
not
the
place
for
detailed
examination
of
the
whole
of
steinthal
theory
and
the
various
phases
not
always
progressive
through
which
he
travelled
especially
after
the
beginning
of
his
spiritual
collaboration
with
lazarus
with
whom
he
studied
ethnopsychology
of
which
they
both
took
linguistic
to
be
a
part
but
while
giving
him
full
credit
for
bringing
humboldt
ideas
into
coherent
order
and
for
clearly
differentiating
as
had
never
before
been
done
between
linguistic
activity
and
the
activity
of
logical
thought
it
must
be
noted
that
steintha
never
recognized
the
identity
of
the
internal
form
of
language
which
he
also
called
the
intuition
of
intuition
or
apperception
with
the
æsthetic
imagination
the
herbartian
psychology
to
which
he
clung
afforded
him
no
clue
to
such
a
discovery
herbart
and
his
followers
divorced
psychology
from
logic
as
a
normative
science
and
never
succeeded
in
discerning
the
true
connection
between
feeling
and
spiritual
formation
soul
and
spirit
they
never
understood
that
logical
thought
is
one
of
these
spiritual
formations
an
activity
not
a
code
of
external
laws
the
domain
allotted
by
them
to
æsthetic
we
already
know
for
them
æsthetic
too
was
only
another
code
of
beautiful
formal
relations
under
the
influence
of
these
doctrines
steinthal
was
led
to
regard
art
as
the
embellishment
of
thoughts
linguistic
as
the
science
of
speech
and
rhetoric
or
æsthetic
as
a
thing
differing
from
linguistic
since
it
is
science
of
fine
or
beautiful
speaking
in
one
of
his
innumerable
tracts
he
says
poetics
and
rhetoric
both
differ
from
linguistic
since
they
are
obliged
to
touch
on
many
important
topics
before
reaching
language
these
sciences
therefore
have
but
one
section
devoted
to
linguistic
which
is
the
concluding
section
of
syntax
moreover
syntax
has
a
character
entirely
different
from
rhetoric
and
from
poetics
the
former
is
occupied
solely
with
correctness
of
language

latter

so

syntax

stylistic
as
is
the
grammatical
measure
of
the
quantity
of
vowels
to
the
theory
of
metre
that
speaking
invariably
means
good
or
beautiful
speaking
since
speech
that
is
neither
good
nor
beautiful
is
not
really
speech
and
that
the
radical
renewal
of
the
concept
of
language
inaugurated
by
humboldt
and
himself
must
produce
effects
on
the
cognate
sciences
of
poetics
rhetoric
and
æsthetic
and
by
transforming

them
never
entered

this

of
the

the
first
place
in
this
sphere
to

ingenuity
was
devoted
in

days
to

been
observed
that
of

six
possible
combinations
of
the
three
terms

four
were
actually
adopted
by
schelling
by

by

himself
states
that
wirth
author
of

the
fifth
combination
which
leaves
us
but
the
sixth
unclaimed
unless
as
is
not
improbable
some
unrecognized
genius
seized
upon
it
and
made
it
the
text
of
his
system
beauty
therefore
as
the
second
form
of
the
absolute
spirit
is
the
realization
of
the
idea
not
as
abstract
concept
but
as
union
of
concept
and
reality
and
the
idea
determines
itself
as
species
and
every
idea
of
a
species
even
on
the
lowest
degree
is
beautiful
as
being
an
integral
part
in
the
totality
of
ideas
although
the
higher
the
degree
of
the
idea
the
greater
is
its
beauty
highest
of
all
degrees
is
that
of
human
personality
in
this
spiritual
world
the
idea
attains
its
true
significance
the
name
of
idea
is
given
to
the
great
moral
motive
powers
to
which
the
concept
of
species
may
also
be
applied
in
the
sense
that
they
stand
to
their
restricted
spheres
in
the
same
relation
in
which
the
genus
stands
to
its
species
and
individuals
at
the
head
of
all
is
the
idea
of
morality
the
world
of
moral
and
autonomous
ends
is
destined
to
furnish
the
most
important
the
most
worthy
content
of
the
beautiful
with
the
warning
however
that
beauty
in
actualizing
this
world
through
intuition
excludes
art
having
a
moral
tendency
so
vischer
proceeds
now
to
degrade
hegel
idea
to
the
simple
now
to
couple
it
with
the
idea
of
the
good
now
in
accord
with
the
teaching
of
his
master
to
make
it
different

yet
superior

sidenote
from
the
first
the
herbartian
formalism
was
little
studied
and
less
followed
two
writers
griepenkerl

and
bobrik
in
made
some
attempt
to
develop
and
apply
the
cursory
notes
with
which
herbart
contented
himself
schleiermacher
lectures
even
before
their
appearance
in
book
form
had
served
as
basis
for
a
series
of
elegant
dissertations
by
erich
ritter
better
known
as
a
historian
of
philosophy
his
work
is
of
little
value
for
instead
of
dwelling
on
the
important
points
of
the
master
doctrine
ritter
brings
into
prominence
secondary
matters
relating
to
sociability
and
the
æsthetic
fife
a
penetrating
critic
of
german
æsthetic
from
baumgarten
to
the
school
was
wilhelm
theodor
danzel
who
lived
about
this
time
and
very
properly
rebelled
against
the
claim
to
find
thought
in
works
of
art
artistic
thought
he
writes
unhappy
phrase
which
helped
to
condemn
an
entire
epoch
to
the
sisyphean
labour
of
trying
to
reduce
art
to
intellectual
and
rational
thinking
the
thought
of
a
work
of
art
is
nothing
save
that
which
is
contemplated
in
a
definite
way
it
is
not
represented
as
is
commonly
asserted
in
a
work
of
art
it
is
the
work
of
art
itself
artistic
thought
can
never
be
expressed
by
concepts
and
words
by
his
early
death
danzel
ended
the
hopes
he
raised
by
his
original
views
on
the
science
and
history
of
æsthetic
sidenote
of
the
beautiful
in
nature
and
that
of
the
modifications
of
the
metaphysical
æsthetic
is
chiefly
noteworthy
for
the
fuller
development
of
two
theories
or
to
speak
more
accurately
of
two
very
curious
combinations
of
arbitrary
assertion
and
fanciful
caprice
the
theory
of
natural
beauty
and
the
theory
of
modifications
of
the
beautiful
neither
of
the
two
had
any
intimate
or
necessary
connexion
with
this
philosophical
movement
to
which
they
are
rather
linked
by
historical
or
psychological
causes
by
the
relationship
between
facts
of
pleasure
and
pain
and
the
inclination
towards
mysticism
by
the
confusion
arising
from
the
really
æsthetic
imaginative
quality
of
some
representations
wrongly
described
as
observation
of
natural
beauties
or
by
the
scholastic
and
literary
tradition
of
discussing
these
cases
of
pleasure
and
pain
and
natural
beauties
in
books
devoted
to
the
discussion
of
art
these
metaphysicians
were
sometimes
rather
grotesque
and
remind
one
of
the
story
told
of
paisiello
that
in
the
fury
of
composition
he
set
even
the
stage
directions
of
his
libretto
to
music
bitten
with
the
rage
for
construction
and
dialectic
they
did
not
spare
even
the
indexes
of
chaotic
old
books
but
seized
on
them
as
suitable
material
for
a
dialectical
exercise
sidenote
of
the
first
theory
beginning
with
the
theory
of
natural
beauty
observations
on
beautiful
natural
objects
are
found
among
the
inquiries
of
the
ancient
philosophers
on
beauty
and
especially
among
the
mystical
effusions
of
and
their
followers
in
the
middle
ages
and
the
renaissance
less
frequently
such
questions
were
introduced
into
treatises
on
poetics
tesauro
is
among
the
first
who
in
his
aristotelico
discusses
not
only
the
conceits
of
men
but
also
of
god
the
angels
nature
and
animals
and
somewhat
later
muratori
speaks
of
the
beauty
of
matter
of
which
examples
are
the
gods
a
flower
the
sun
a
rivulet
observations
on
that
which
is
outside
art
and
is
merely
natural
are
made
by
crousaz
by
andré
and
especially
by
those
authors
of
the
eighteenth
century
who
wrote
on
beauty
and
art
in
an
empirical
and
gallant
style
it
was
the
influence
of
these
persons
that
led
kant
as
we
have
seen
to
sever
the
theory
of
beauty
from
that
of
art
specially
connecting
free
beauty
with
objects
of
nature
and
those
productions
of
man
which
reproduce
natural
beauties
when
the
adversary
of
kant
theory
of
æsthetic
herder
in
his
sketch
of
an
ethical
system
united
spirit
and
nature
pleasure
and
value
feeling
and
intellect
he
inevitably
made
much
of
natural
beauty
and
affirmed
that
everything
in
nature
has
its
own
beauty
the
expression
of
its
own
greatest
content
and
that
this
accounts
for
the
ascending
scale
of
beautiful
objects
beginning
with
outlines
colours
and
tones
light
and
sound
and
proceeding
by
way
of
flowers
water
and
sea
to
birds
terrestrial
animals
and
man
himself
for
instance
a
bird
is
the
sum
of
the
properties
and
perfections
of
its
element
a
representation
of
its
potency
a
creature
of
light
song
and
air
amongst
terrestrial
animals
the
ugliest
are
those
resembling
man
as
the
melancholy
moping
monkey
the
most
beautiful
those
of
perfect
build
well
proportioned
noble
free
in
action
those
which
express
sweetness
those
in
fine
which
live
in
harmony
and
happiness
endowed
with
a
perfection
of
their
own
harmless
to
man
sidenote
solger
schelling
on
the
contrary
utterly
denies
the
concept
of
beauty
in
nature
and
considers
that
such
beauty
is
purely
accidental
and
that
art
alone
supplies
the
norm
by
which
it
can
be
discovered
and
judged
solger
also
excludes
natural
beauty
so
does
hegel
who
distinguishes
himself
not
by
denying
it
but
by
proceeding
with
the
utmost
inconsequence
to
deal
at
length
with
the
beautiful
in
nature
it
is
in
fact
not
clear
whether
he
means
that
really
no
beauty
exists
in
nature
and
that
man
introduces
it
in
his
vision
of
things
or
whether
natural
beauty
really
exists
though
inferior
in
degree
to
the
beauty
of
art
the
beauty
of
art
he
says
stands
higher
than
that
of
nature
it
is
beauty
born
and
reborn
by
the
work
of
the
spirit
and
spirit
alone
is
truth
and
reality
hence
beauty
is
truly
beauty
only
when
it
participates
in
spirit
and
is
produced
therefrom
taken
in
this
sense
the
beauty
of
nature
appears
as
a
mere
reflexion
of
the
beauty
appertaining
to
spirit
as
an
imperfect
and
incomplete
mode
which
substantially
is
contained
within
the
spirit
itself
in
confirmation
he
adds
that
nobody
has
attempted
a
systematic
exposition
of
natural
beauties
whereas
there
actually
is
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
utility
of
natural
objects
a
but
the
second
chapter
of
the
first
part
of
his
æsthetic
is
devoted
precisely
to
natural
beauty
on
the
ground
that
in
order
to
grasp
the
idea
of
artistic
beauty
in
its
entirety
three
stages
must
be
traversed
beauty
in
general
natural
beauty
whose
defects
show
the
necessity
for
art
and
lastly
the
idea
the
first
existence
of
the
idea
is
nature
and
its
first
beauty
is
natural
beauty
this
beauty
which
is
beauty
for
us
and
not
for
itself
has
several
phases
from
that
in
which
the
concept
is
immersed
in
matter
to
the
point
of
disappearing
such
as
physical
facts
and
isolated
mechanisms
to
that
higher
phase
in
which
physical
facts
are
united
in
systems
the
solar
system
but
the
idea
first
reaches
a
true
and
real
existence
in
organic
facts
in
the
living
creature
and
even
the
living
creature
is
liable
to
the
distinction
between
beautiful
and
ugly
for
example
among
animals
the
sloth
trailing
itself
laboriously
and
incapable
of
animation
or
activity
displeases
us
by
its
apathetic
somnolence
nor
can
beauty
be
found
in
amphibians
or
in
many
kinds
of
fish
or
in
crocodiles
or
toads
as
well
as
in
many
insects
and
especially
in
those
equivocal
creatures
which
express
a
transition
from
one
i
class
to
another
such
as
the
ornithorhyncus
a
mixture
of
bird
and
beast
these
samples
may
suffice
to
show
the
general
trend
of
hegel
doctrine
of
natural
beauty
elsewhere
he
discusses
the
external
beauty
of
abstract
form
regularity
symmetry
harmony
which
are
precisely
the
concepts
which
the
formalism
of
herbart
placed
in
the
heaven
of
the
ideas
of
the
beautiful
sidenote
schleiermacher
who
praised
hegel
for
his
attempt
to
exclude
natural
beauty
from
his
æsthetic
excluded
it
from
his
own
not
verbally
but
actually
by
confining
his
attention
to
the
artistic
perfection
of
the
internal
image
formed
by
the
energy
of
the
human
spirit
but
the
feeling
for
nature
which
came
in
with
romanticism
and
the
and
other
descriptive
works
of
humboldt
directed
attention
increasingly
to
the
impressions
awakened
by
natural
facts
sidenote
this
led
to
the
compilation
of
those
systematic
lists
of
natural
beauties
whose
impossibility
had
been
proclaimed
by
hegel
though
he
himself
had
furnished
an
example
of
them
amongst
others
bratranek
published
an

the

æsthetic
physics
the
and
most
widely
circulated
treatment
of
the
subject
was
contained
in
this
very
work
of
vischer
who
following
hegel
example
devoted
a
section
of
his
as
we
have
seen
to
the
objective
existence
of
beauty
to
the
beauty
of
nature
and
entitled
it
by
the
perhaps
new
and
certainly
characteristic
name
of
æsthetic
physics
this
æsthetic

comprised
the
beauty
of

according
to
vischer
it
was
the
duty
of
æsthetic
to
cast
a
glance
over
universal
history
before
summing
up

different
degrees

of

frequently
those
of

contained

less
scientific

to

first
theorized
about

all
without
attempting
to
link

up
together
by
introducing

artificial
logical
connexion
kant
who
had
already
in
imitation
of
burke
written
in
a
dissertation
on
the
beautiful
and
the
sublime
ingenuously
remarked
in
the
course
of
his
lectures
on
logic
in
that
the
beautiful
and
the
æsthetic
are
not
identical
because
the
sublime
also
belongs
to
æsthetic
and
in
his
of
judgment
while
treating
of
the
comic
in
a
mere
digression
a
magnificent
piece
of
psychological
analysis
places
side
by
side
with
and
as
if
on
an
equality
with
the
analytic
of
beauty
an
analytic
of
the
sublime
we
may
note
in
passing
that
before
the
publication
of
the
third
critique
heydenreich
arrived
at
the
same
doctrine
of
the
sublime
which
is
contained
in
kant
book
did
kant
ever
think
of
uniting
the
beautiful
and
the
sublime
and
deducing
them
from
a
single
concept
apparently
not
by
his
declaration
that
the
principle
of
beauty
must
be
sought
outside
ourselves
and
that
of
the
sublime
within
us
he
tacitly
assumes
that
the
two
objects
are
wholly
disparate
in
ast
a
follower
of
schelling
declared
the
necessity
of
overcoming
what
he
called
the
kantian
dualism
of
the
beautiful
and
the
sublime

reproached

with
having
treated
the
comic
by
the
psychological
not
the
metaphysical
method

that
all
these
concepts
are
irrelevant

he
attributes
them
to
the
work
of

not
to
pure
beauty
schleiermacher
comes
to
the
same
conclusion
but
for
much
better
reasons
as
a
result
of
his
sane
conception
of
art
amongst
other
things
he
observes
it
is
usual
to
describe
the
beautiful
and
the
sublime
as
two
kinds
of
artistic
perfection
and
so
accustomed
have
we
grown
to
the
union
of
these
two
concepts
that
we
must
make
an
effort
to
convince
ourselves
how
very
far
they
are
from
being
or
from
together
exhausting
the
concept
of
artistic
perfection
he
regrets
that
even
the
best
æstheticians
should
give
rhetorical
descriptions
of
them
instead
of
demonstrating
them
the
thing
says
he
is
not
right
and
just
keine
and
he
proceeds
to
exclude
the
whole
subject
from
his
æsthetic
as
he
had
done
previously
in
the
case
of
natural
beauty
other
philosophers
however
clung
persistently
to
their
search
for
a
connexion
between
these
various
concepts
and
called
in
dialectic
to
help
them
the
habit
of
applying
dialectic
to
empirical
concepts
affected
everybody
at
that
time
even
the
great
enemy
of
dialectic
herbart
showed
the
cloven
hoof
when
in
order
to
explain
the
union
of
different
æsthetic
ideas
in
the
beautiful
he
appealed
to
the
formula
they
lose
regularity
in
order
to
regain
it
schelling
asserted
that
the
sublime
is
the
infinite
in
the
finite
and
the
beautiful
the
finite
in
the
infinite
adding
that
the
absolutely
sublime
includes
the
beautiful
and
the
beautiful
the
sublime
and
ast
whom
we
have
mentioned
already
spoke
of
a
masculine
positive
element
which
is
the
sublime
and
a
feminine
negative
element
which
is
the
graceful
and
pleasing
between
which
there
is
a
contrast
and
a
struggle
sidenote
of
the
these
exercises
in
dialectical
developed
and
increased
till
about
the
middle
of
the
nineteenth
century
they
assumed
two
distinct
forms
whose
history
must
here
be
shortly
outlined
sidenote
form
of
the
theory
the
overcoming
of
the
ugly
solger
weisse
and
the
first
form
may
be
called
the
overcoming
of
the
ugly
this
theory
conceives
the
comic
the
sublime
the
tragic
the
humorous
and
so
forth
as
so
many
engagements
in
the
war
between
the
ugly
and
the
beautiful
wherein
the
latter
was
invariably
victorious
and
arose
by
means
of
this
war
to
more
and
more
lofty
and
complex
manifestations
the
second
form
of
the
theory
may
be
described
as
the
passage
from
abstract
to
concrete
it
held
that
beauty
can
not
emerge
from
the
abstract
can
not
become
this
or
that
concrete
beauty
except
by
particularizing
itself
in
the
comic
tragic
sublime
humorous
or
some
other
modification
the
first
form
was
already
well
developed
in
solgei
an
adherent
of
the
romantic
theory
of
irony
but
historically
it
presupposes
the
æsthetic
theory
of
the
ugly
first
sketched
by
friedrich
schlegel
in
we
have
already
noted
that
schlegel
considered
the
characteristic
or
interesting
not
the
beautiful
to
be
the
principle
of
modern
art
hence
the
importance
attached
by
him
to
the
piquant
the
striking
the
daring
the
cruel
the
ugly
solger
found
here
the
basis
for
his
dialectic
amongst
other
things
he
maintains
that
the
finite
earthly
element
may
be
dissolved
and
absorbed
in
the
divine
which
constitutes
the
tragic
or
else
the
divine
element
may
be
entirely
corrupted
by
the
earthly
producing
the
comic
these
methods
of
solger
were
followed
by
weisse
and
by
ruge
for
the
former
ugliness
is
the
immediate
existence
of
beauty
which
is
overcome
in
the
sublime
and
the
comic
for
the
latter
the
effort
to
achieve
the
idea
or
the
idea
searching
for
itself
generates
the
sublime
when
the
idea
loses
instead
of
discovering
itself
ugliness
is
produced
when
the
idea
rediscovers
itself
and
rises
out
of
ugliness
to
new
life
the
comic
a
whole
treatise
entitled
æsthetic
of
the
was
published
by
rosenkranz
in
presenting
this
concept
as
intermediate
between
the
beautiful
and
the
comic
and
tracing
it
from
its
first
origin
to
that
sort
of
perfection
it
attains
in
the
satanic
passing
from
the
common
which
is
the
petty
the
weak
the
low
and
the
of
the
low
viz
the
usual
the
casual
the
arbitrary
and
the
crude
rosenkranz
goes
on
to
describe
the
repugnant
trisected
into
the
awkward
the
dead
and
empty
and
the
horrible
thus
he
proceeds
from
tripartition
to
tripartition
dividing
the
horrible
into
the
absurd
the
nauseating
and
the
wicked
the
wicked
into
criminal
spectral
and
diabolical
the
diabolical
into
demoniac
magical
and
satanic
he
opposes
the
childish
notion
that
ugliness
acts
as
a
foil
to
beauty
in
art
and
justifies
its
introduction
by
the
necessity
for
art
to
represent
the
entire
appearance
of
the
idea
on
the
other
hand
he
admits
that
the
ugly
is
not
on
the
same
level
as
the
beautiful
for
if
the
beautiful
can
stand
by
itself
alone
the
other
can
not
do
so
and
must
always
be
reflected
by
and
in
the
beautiful
sidenote
from
abstract
to
concrete
the
second
form
prevailed
with
vischer
the
following
extract
will
serve
as
an
illustration
of
his
manner
the
idea
arouses
itself
from
the
tranquil
unity
in
which
it
was
fused
with
the
appearance
and
pushes
onward
affirming
in
face
of
its
own
finitude
its
infinity
this
rebellion
and
transcendence
is
the
sublime
but
beauty
demands
full
satisfaction
for
this
disruption
of
its
harmony
the
violated
right
of
the
image
must
be
reasserted
this
can
be
accomplished
only
by
means
of
a
fresh
contradiction
that
is
to
say
by
the
negative
position
now
taken
up
by
the
image
towards
the
idea
by
rejecting
all
interpenetration
with
it
and
by
affirming
its
own
separate
existence
as
the
whole
this
second
moment
is
the
comic
negation
of
a
negation
the
same
process
is
further
enriched
and
complicated
by
zeising
who
compares
the
modifications
of
beauty
to
the
refraction
of
colours
the
three
primary
modifications
the
sublime
the
attractive
and
the
humorous
correspond
with
the
primary
colours
violet
orange
and
green
the
three
secondary
pure
beauty
comic
and
tragic
to
the
colours
red
yellow
and

each
of
these
six
modifications
exactly
like

out
like

into

pure

into
the
decorous
noble
and

and
piquant
the

into
buffoonery
the
diverting
and
burlesque
the
humorous
into
the
quaint
capricious
and
melancholy
the
tragic
into
the
moving
pathetic
and
demoniac
the

into
the
glorious
majestic
and
imposing

legend
of
sir
all
the
works
of
this
period
on
æsthetic
are
filled
in
this
way
with
the
or
romaunt
of
the
knight
sir
purebeauty
and
his
extraordinary
adventures
recounted
in
two
conflicting
versions
according
to
one
story
sir
purebeauty
is
constrained
to
abandon
his
beloved
leisure
by
the
mephistophelean
devices
of
the
temptress
ugliness
who
leads
him
into
countless
dangers
from
which
he
invariably
emerges
victorious
his
victories
and
successes
his
marengo
austerlitz
and
jena
are
called
the
sublime
the
comic
the
humorous
and
so
forth
the
other
story
tells
how
the
knight
bored
by
his
life
of
loneliness
sallies
forth
purposely
to
seek
adversaries
and
occasions
for
fighting
he
is
always
vanquished
but
even
in
his
overthrow

he
transforms
and
irradiates
the
enemy
beyond

artificial

this

on

the

inferior
level
of

degree
france
still
lay
under
the
dominion
of
the
sensationalism
of
condillac
and
at
the
opening
of
the
century
was
quite
incapable
of
grasping
the
spiritual
activity
of
art
a
faint
gleam
of
winckelmann
abstract
spiritualism
just
appears
in
the
theories
of
quatremère
de
quincy
who
in
criticism
of
in
his
turn
a
critic
of
ideal
beauty
and
an
adherent
of
the
imitation
of
nature
maintained
that
the
arts
of
design
have
pure
beauty
devoid
of
individual
character
as
their
objective
they
depict
man
and
not
men
some
sensationalists
such
as
bonstetten
vainly
endeavoured
to
trace
the
peculiar
processes
of
imagination
in
life
and
in
art
followers
of
the
orthodox
spiritualism
of
the
french
universities
date
the
beginning
of
a
new
era
and
the
foundation
of
æsthetic
in
france
to
the
year
when
victor
cousin
first
delivered
at
the
sorbonne
his
lectures
on
the
true
the
beautiful
and
the
good
which
later
formed
his
book
with
the
same
name
frequently
reprinted
these
lectures
of
cousin
are
but
poor
stuff
although
some
scraps
of
kant
are
to
be
found
in
them
here
and
there
he
denies
the
identity
of
the
beautiful
with
the
pleasant
or
useful
and
substitutes
the
affirmation
of
a
threefold
beauty
physical
intellectual
and
moral
the
last
being
the
true
ideal
beauty
having
its
foundations
in
god
he
says
that
art
expresses
ideal
beauty
the
infinite
god
that
genius
is
the
power
of
creation
and
that
taste
is
a
mixture
of
fancy
sentiment
and
reason
academic
phrases
all
of
them
pompous
and
void
and
for
that
very
reason
well
received
of
much
greater
value
were
the
lectures
on
æsthetic
delivered
by
théodore
jouffroy
in
before
a
small
audience
and
published
posthumously
in
jouffroy
allowed
a
beauty
of
expression
to
be
found
alike
in
art
and
nature
a
beauty
of
imitation
consisting
in
the
perfect
accuracy
with
which
a
model
is
reproduced
a
beauty
of
idealisation
which
reproduces
the
model
accentuating
a
particular
quality
in
order
to
give
it
greater
significance
and
finally
a
beauty
of
the
invisible
or
of
content
reducible
to
force
physical
sensible
intellectual
moral
which
as
force
awakens
sympathy
ugliness
is
the
negation
of
this
sympathetic
beauty
its
species
or
modifications
are
the
sublime
and
the
graceful
one
sees
that
jouffroy
did
not
succeed
in
isolating
the
strictly
æsthetic
fact
in
his
analysis
and
gave
instead
of
a
scientific
system
little
beyond
explanations
of
the
use
of
words
he
could
not
see
or
understand
that
expression
imitation
and
idealization
are
identical
with
each
other
and
with
artistic
activity
moreover
he
had
many
curious
ideas
chiefly
concerning
expression
he
said
that
if
we
were
to
see
a
drunkard
with
all
the
most
disgusting
symptoms
of
intoxication
on
a
road
where
there
was
also
an
unhewn
rock
we
should
be
pleased
by
the
drunken
man
since
he
had
expression
and
not
by
the
rock
since
it
had
none
beside
jouffroy
whose
theories
crude
and
immature
though
they
be
reveal
an
inquiring
mind
it
is
hardly
worth
while
to
cite
lamennais
who
like
cousin
regarded
art
as
the
manifestation
of
the
infinite
through
the
finite
of
the
absolute
through
the
relative
french
romanticism
in
de
bonald
de
barante
and
mme
de
staël
had
defined
literature
as
the
expression
of
society
had
honoured
under
german
influence
the
characteristic
and
the
grotesque
and
had
proclaimed
the
independence
of
art
by
means
of
the
formula
art
for
art
sake
but
these
vague
affirmations
or
aphorisms
did
not
supersede
philosophically
speaking
the
old
doctrine
of
the
imitation
of
nature
sidenote
in
england
associationistic
psychology
still
flourished
and
has
continued
to
flourish
uninterruptedly
unable
to
emancipate
itself
wholly
from
sensationalism
or
to
understand
imagination
dugald
stewart
had
recourse
to
the
wretched
expedient
of
establishing
two
forms
of
association
one
of
accidental
associations
the
other
of
associations
innate
in
human
nature
and
therefore
common
to
all
mankind
england
did
not
escape
german
influence
as
appears
for
example
in
coleridge
to
whom
we
owe
a
saner
concept
of
poetry
and
the
difference
between
it
and
science

collaboration
with
the

the
most
noteworthy
english
æsthetic
essay
of

the
of
by
shelley
containing
profound
if
not
very
systematic
views
on
the
distinctions
between
reason
and
imagination
prose
and
poetry
on
primitive
language
and
the
faculty

where
neither
parini
nor

had
been
able
to
shake
off
the
fetters
of
the
old
doctrines
although
the
latter
in
his
later
writings
was
in
several
ways
an
innovator
in
literary
criticism
many
treatises
and
essays
on
æsthetic
were
published
during
the
earlier
decades
of
the
century

greater
part
showing
the
influence
of
condillac
sensationalism

had
a
great
vogue
in
italy
such
authors
as
delfico
malaspina
cicognara
talia
pasquali
visconti
and
bonacci
belong
more
exclusively
to
the
special
or
rather
the
anecdotal
history
of
italian
philosophy
now
and
then
however
one
comes
across
remarks
that
are
not
wholly
contemptible
as
in
melchiorre
delfico
who
after
wandering
aimlessly
hither
and
thither
fixes
on
the
principle
of
expression
observing
if
it
were
possible
to
establish
that
expression
is
always
an
element
in
the
beautiful
it
would
be
a
legitimate
inference
to
regard
it
as
the
real
characteristic
of
beauty
a
condition
without
which
the
beautiful
could
not
exist
and
the
pleasing
modification
which
arouses
the
sentiment
of
beauty
could
not
take
place
in
us
he
tries
to
develop
this
principle
by
asserting
that
all
other
characters
order
harmony
proportion
symmetry
simplicity
unity
and
variety
have
significance
only
by
their
subordination
to
the
principle
of
expression
in
opposition
to
malaspina
definition
of
beauty
as
pleasure
born
of
a
representation
and
in
opposition
to
the
then
fashionable
threefold
division
of
beauty
into
sensible
moral
and
intellectual
a
critic
of
malaspina
observed
that
if
beauty
be
representation
it
is
inconceivable
that
there
should
be
intellectual
beauty
which
would
be
intelligible
but
not
presentable
nor
must

neither

to
the
deontological
sciences
which
treat
of
the
perfection
of
being
and
the
method
of
acquiring
or
producing
such
perfection
or
losing
it
among
these
sciences
is
that
of
beauty
in
the
universal
under
the
name
of
callology
of
which
a
special
part
is
æsthetic
the
science
of
beauty
in
the
sensible
establishing
the
archetypes
of
beings
in
his
longest
literary
work
considered
by
him
as
his
æsthetic
his
essay
on
rosmini
declares
the
aim
of
art
to
be
neither
imitation
of
nature
nor
direct
intuition
of
the
archetypes
but
the
reduction
of
natural
things
to
their
archetypes
which
are
arranged
in
a
hierarchy
of
three
ideals
natural
intellectual
and
moral
gioberti
is
clearly
under
the
influence
of
german
idealism
especially
of
schelling
for
him
the
beautiful
is
the
individual
union
of
an
intelligible
type
with
an
imaginative
element
called
into
being
by
fancy
the
phantasm
gives
material
while
the
intelligible
type
concept
gives
form
in
the
aristotelian
sense
and
since
the
ideal
element
predominates
over
the
sensible
or
fantastic
art
is
a
propædeutic
to
the
true
and
the
good
gioberti
is
of
opinion
that
hegel
was
wrong
in
detaching
natural
beauty
from
æsthetic
for
perfect
beauty
of
nature
is
the
full
correspondence
of
sensible
reality
with
the
idea
which
informs
and
represents
it
and
as
such
makes
its
appearance
in
the
sensible
universe
during
the
second
period
of
the
primordial
age
described
in
detail
by
moses
in
the
six
days
of
creation
it
is
only
through
original
sin
that
imperfection
and
ugliness
arose
in
nature
art
is
nothing
but
a
supplement
to
natural
beauty
whose
decadence
it
presupposes
and
thus
art
is
at
once
record
and
prophecy
referring
to
the
first
and
last
ages
of
the
world
the
last
judgement
will
reintroduce
perfect
beauty
organic
restitution
by
empowering
the
faculties
to
contemplate
the
intelligible
in
the
sensible
and
by
refining
their
capabilities
will
greatly
intensify
and
purify
æsthetic
enjoyment
the
contemplation
of
perfect
beauty
will
be
the
beatitude
of
imagination
of
which
christ
gave
an
ineffable
foretaste
by
appearing
to
his
disciples
visibly
transfigured
and
shining
with
celestial
radiance
gioberti
agrees
with
schelling
division
of
art
into
pagan
and
christian
a
heterodox
beauty
oriental
and
art
imperfect
when
compared
with
orthodox
beauty
and
between
the
two
a
beauty
transitional
to
christian
art
he
also
attempted
a
doctrine
of
modifications
of
the
beautiful
wherein
he
held
the
sublime
to
be
creator
of
the
beautiful
beauty
is
the
relative
intelligibility
of
created
things
apprehended
by
fancy
the
sublime
is
the
absolute
intelligibility
of
time
space
and
infinite
power
as
presented
to
itself
by
the
faculty
of
imagination
the
ideal
formula
the
being
creates
the
existing
translated
into
æsthetic
language
gives
the
following
formula
by
means
of
the
dynamical
sublime
being
creates
the
beautiful
and
by
means
of
the
mathematical
sublime
contains
it
this
shows
the
ontological
and
psychological
connexions
of
æsthetic
in
first
science
ugliness
enters
into
the
beautiful
either
as
relief
and
counterpoise
or
to
open
a
way
to
the
comic
or
to
depict
the
struggle
between
good
and
evil
the
christian
ideal
of
artistic
beauty
is
the
figure
of
the
absolute
union
of
the
two
forms
of
beauty
the
sublime
and
the
beautiful
a
transfigured
and
divinely
illuminated
expression
of
man
however
carefully
we
sift
the
thoughts
of
gioberti
from
their
mythological
husk
we
find
nothing
of
the
least
value
to
science

if
italian
literature
of
the
day
chose
to

refurbish
certain
antiquated
critical
ideas
a
much
wider
field
was
opened
by
social
and
political
upheavals
which
tended
to
make

of
literature
as
a

that

is

to

and
satisfy
the
cravings
of

the
principles
of
rosmini

in
his
letter
on
romanticism
that
poetry
or
literature
in
general
should
have
utility
as
its
objective
truth
as
its
subject
and
interest
as
its
means
and
though
noticing
the
vagueness
of
the
concept
of
truth
in
poetry
he
inclined
always
as
is
seen
also
in
his
discourse
on
the
historical
novel
to
its
identification
with
historical
and
scientific
truth
pietro

as

hand
the
autonomy
of

found
a
strong
supporter
in

in
the
critical
work
of
francesco
de
sanctis
who
held
private
classes
in
literature
at
naples
from
to
taught
at
turin
and
zürich
from
to
and
in
became
professor
in
the
university
of
naples
he
expressed
his
doctrines
in
critical
essays
in
monographs
on
italian
writers
and
in
his
classic
of
italian
receiving
his
first
elements
of
old
italian
culture
in
school
his
natural
bent
towards
speculation
led
him
to
investigate
grammatical
and
rhetorical
doctrines
with
the
view
of
reducing
them
to
a
system
but
he
soon
began
to
criticize
and
to
grow
out
of
this
phase
he
pronounced
fortunio
alunno
accarisio
and
corso
empirics
he
had
a
slightly
better
opinion
of
bembo
varchi
castelvetro
and
salviati
who
introduced
method
into
grammar
a
process
completed
subsequently
by
buonmattei
corticelli
and
bartoli
and
he
proclaimed
francisco
sanchez
author
of
the
the
descartes
of
grammarians
from
these
his
admiration
spread
to
the
french
writers
of
the
eighteenth
century
and
the
philosophical
grammars
of
du
marsais
beauzée
condillac
and
gérard
following
in
their
wake
and
pursuing
the
ideal
of
leibniz
he
conceived
a
logical
grammar
in
this
effort
however
he
soon
began
to
recognize
the
impossibility
of
reducing
the
differences
of
languages
to
fixed
logical
if
he
found
the
french
theorists
admirable
in
their
ability
to
reconstitute
the
simple
and
primitive
forms
from
i
love
to
i
am
loving
something
disquieted
him
such
decomposition
of
love
into
am
loving
said
he
deadens
the
word
by
depriving
it
of
the
movement
proceeding
from
active
will
in
the
same
way
he
read
and
criticized
the
writers
of
treatises
on
rhetoric
and
poetics
from
men
such
as
castelvetro
and
torquato
tasso
whom
he
dared
to
describe
as
an
indifferent
critic
to
the
great
scandal
of
neapolitan
men
of
letters
to
muratori
and
gravina
more
acute
than
accurate
and
italians
bettinelli
algarotti
and
cesarotti
coldly
rational
rules
found
no
favour

him
he
urged
the
young
to
confront
literary
works
boldly
and
freely
absorb

the
only
possible
foundation
for
taste
sidenote
of
philosophical
study
had
not
been
abandoned
and
had
not
even
fallen
into
entire
decadence
in
southern
italy
in
these
days
of
renewed
interest
in
philosophy
the
theories
on
beauty
from
over
the
alps
and
the
new
ideas
of
gioberti
and
other
italians
aroused
enthusiastic
discussion

and
in
its
desire

itself

himself
had
to
translate
the
greater
of
hegel
and
rosenkranz
of
in
the
dungeon
of
the
bourbon
prison
where
he
was
incarcerated
on
account
of
his
liberal
opinions
the
new
critical
tendency
was
named
philosophism
to
distinguish
it
from
the
old
grammatical
criticism
and
from
the
vague
incoherent
exaggerated
romanticism
philosophism
attracted
de
sanctis
to
show
how
deeply
he
was
imbued
with
the
hegelian
spirit
a
tale
was
told
that
having
devoured
the
first
volumes
of
bénard
translation
he
guessed
the
contents
of
the
remaining
volumes
and
before
they
could
appear
was
expounding
them
publicly
in
his
classroom
his
first
writings
show
traces
of
metaphysical
idealism
and
hegelism
and
they
still
linger
here
and
there
in
the
terminology
of
his
later
works
in
a
lecture
prior
to
he
placed
the
safety
of
criticism
in
the
philosophic
school
which
in
works
of
literature
fixed
its
eyes
upon
that
absolute
part
that
uncertain
idea
which
moves
within
the
mind
of
great
writers
till
it
appears
abroad
clothed
in
fine
raiment
only
less
beautiful
than
itself
in
a
preface
to
schiller
plays
he
wrote
the
idea
is
not
thought
nor
is
poetry
reason
in
song
as
a
poet
of
our
time
is
pleased
to
assert
the
idea
is
at
once
necessity
and
freedom
reason
and
passion
and
its
perfect
form
in
drama
is
action
elsewhere
he
calls
attention
to
the
death
of
faith
and
poetry
absorbed
by
the
development
of
philosophy
a
thesis
he
remarked
some
years
later
imposed
on
our
generation
by
hegel
with
his
omnipotent
thought
in
he
attempted
a
definition
of
humour
as
an
artistic
form
having
for
signification
the
destruction
of
limit
with
consciousness
of
such
destruction
not
to
dwell
too
long
on
other
particulars
in
the
distinction
to
which
de
sanctis
always
held
firm
throughout
his
critical
work
that
between
fancy
and
imagination
the
latter
considered
as
the
true
and
only
faculty
of
poetry
arises
undoubtedly
from
suggestions
of
schelling
and
hegel
phantasie
from
the
same
philosophers
come
the
phrases
prosaic
content
prosaic
world
sometimes
used
by
him
sidenote
criticism
of
for
de
sanctis
the
hegelian
æsthetic
was
but
a
lever
wherewith
to
lift
himself
clear
of
the
discussions
and
views
of
the
old
italian
schools
a
fresh
clear
spirit
such
as
his
could
not
escape
the
arbitrary
shackles
of
grammarians
and
rhetoricians
only
to
fall
into
those
of
metaphysicians
the
torturers
of
art
he
absorbed
the
vital
part
of
hegel
teaching
and
the
hegelian
theories
in
correct
or
somewhat
attenuated
interpretations
but
he
only
maintained
with
hesitation
and
in
the
end
openly
rebelled
against
all
that
was
artificial
formalistic
and
pedantic
in
hegel
the
following
examples
of
such
reductions
and
attenuations
show
how
substantial
and
radical
was
the
change
he
effected
faith
has
vanished
and
poetry
is
dead
he
wrote
in
echoing
hegel
or
it
were
better
to
say
here
is
de
sanctis
own
correction
faith
and
poetry
are
immortal
what
has
disappeared
is
but
one
particular
mode
of
their
being
faith
springs
from
conviction
and
poetry
is
the
spark
struck
from
meditation
they
are
not
dead
they
are
transformed
certainly
he
distinguished
between
imagination
and
fancy
but
for
him
imagination
was
never
the
mystic
faculty
of
transcendental
apperception
the
intellectual
intuition
of
german
metaphysicians
but
simply
the
poet
faculty
of
synthesis
and
creation
contrasting
with
fancy
as
the
faculty
of
collecting
particulars
and
materials
in
a
somewhat
mechanical
fashion
when
students
of
vico
and
hegel
understood
and
expounded
their
master
theories
as
emphasizing
the
importance
of
concepts
in
art
de
sanctis
replied
the
concept
does
not
exist
in
art
nature
or
history
the
poet
works
unconsciously
and
sees
no
concept
but
only
form
in
which
he
is
involved
and
lost
if
the
philosopher
by
means
of
abstraction
can
extract
the
concept
thence
and
contemplate
it
in
all
its
purity
he
acts
in
a
way
entirely
contrary
to
that
of
art
nature
and
history
he
warned
his
hearers
not
to
misunderstand
vico
who
when
he
extracts
concepts
and
exemplary
types
from
the
homeric
poems
is
not
writing
as
an
art
critic
but
as
a
historian
of
civilization
achilles
is
artistically
achilles
not
strength
or
any
other
abstraction
thus
his
polemic
is
directed
in
the
first
instance
against
misunderstanding
what
he
called
the
true
hegelian
thought
which
was
in
fact
usually
a
correction
made
upon
hegel
more
or
less
consciously
by
himself
he
was
able
to
boast
in
his
latter
years
that
even
at
the
time
when
all
naples
went
wild
over
hegel
at
the
time
when
hegel
was
master
of
the
field
he
had
always
made
certain
reservations
and
refused
to
accept
his
apriorism
his
triad
or
his
formulæ
sidenote
of
german
de
sanctis
also
took
up
an
independent
attitude
towards
the
other
german
æstheticians
the
views
of
wilhelm
schlegel
very
advanced
for
the
day
in
which
they
had
been
promulgated
seemed
to
him
to
have
been
already
superseded
in
he
wrote
that
schlegel
strives
to
transcend
ordinary
criticism
which
leads
a
humdrum
existence
among
phraseology
versification
and
elocution
but
loses
its
way
and
never
comes
face
to
face
with
art
whereas
schlegel
throws
himself
headlong
into
the
probable
the
decorous
and
the
moral
into
everything
save
art
thrown
by
the
hazards
of
life
into
german
territory
he
found
himself
at
the
zürich
polytechnic
and
found
among
his
colleagues
only
imagine
such
a
thing
theodor
vischer
what
opinion
can
he
have
formed
of
the
ponderous
hegelian
scholastic
who
emerged
dusty
and
panting
from
the
systematic
labours
so
well
known
to
us
and
smiled
disdainfully
at
the
poetry
and
music
of
the
decadent
italian
race
de
sanctis
writes
i
went
there
with
my
opinions
and
my
prejudices
and
ridiculed
their
ridicule
richard
wagner
seemed
to
me
a
corrupter
of
music
and
nothing
could
be
more
inæsthetic
than
the
æsthetic
of
vischer
his
desire
to
correct
the
distorted
views
of
vischer
adolf
wagner
valentin
schmidt
and
other
german
critics
and
philosophers
led
him
to
undertake
in
a
course
of
lectures
before
an
international
audience
at
zürich
upon
ariosto
and
petrarch
the
two
italian
poets
worst
maltreated
by
these
judges
because
hardest
to
reduce
to
philosophical
allegory
he
sketched
a
typical
german
critic
and
contrasted
him
with
a
french
one
each
with
his
own
characteristic
defects
the
frenchman
does
not
indulge
in
theories
he
goes
straight
to
the
subject
his
argument
palpitates
with
warmth
of
impression
and
sagacity
of
observation
he
never
leaves
the
concrete

about
this
time
a
piedmontese
review
published
his
exhaustive
critical
survey
of
the
philosophy
of
schopenhauer
which
was
then
beginning
to
attract
disciples
among
his
friends
and
companions
in
exile
in
switzerland
the
criticism
provoked
the
philosopher
himself
to
confess
that
this
italian
had
absorbed
him
succum
et
what
value
did
de
sanctis
attach
to
all
schopenhauer
subtleties
concerning
art
having
fully
stated
his
doctrine
of
ideas
he
contents
himself
with
the
merest
reference
to
the
third
book
wherein
is
found
an
exaggerated
theory
of
æsthetic
sidenote
rebellion
against
metaphysical
this
moderate
resistance
and
opposition
to
the
partisans
of
the
concept
and
to
the
romantic
italian
mystics
and
moralists
he
directed
criticisms
equally
against
manzoni
mazzini
tommaseo
and
cantù
turned
to
open
rebellion
in
one
of
his
critical
writings
on
petrarch
in
which
this
false
tendency
is
characterized
with
biting
sarcasm
according
to
this
school
he
says
meaning
the
school
of
hegel
and
gioberti
according
to
this
school
the
real
and
living
is
art
only
in
so
far
as
it
surpasses
its
form
and
reveals
its
concept
or
the
pure
idea
the
beautiful
is
the
manifestation
of
the
idea
art
is
the
ideal
a
particular
idea
under
the
gaze
of
the
artist
the
body
becomes
subtilized
until
it
is
nothing
but
the
shadow
of
the
soul
a
beautiful
veil
the
world
of
poetry
is
peopled
with
phantasms
and
the
poet
eternal
dreamer
with
the
eyes
of
one
slightly
intoxicated
sees
bodies
float
unsteadily
around
him
and
change
their
shapes
nor
do
bodies
merely
become
attenuated
into
forms
and
phantasms
these
forms
and
phantasms
themselves
become
free
manifestations
of
every
idea
and
every
concept
the
theory
of
the
ideal
has
been
driven
to
its
last
victorious
limit
to
the
destruction
of
the
very
phantasms
themselves
to
concept
as
concept
form
becoming
a
mere
accessory
thus
the
vague
the
undecided
the
undulating
the
vaporous
the
celestial
the
ærial
the
veiled
the
angelic
have
now
a
high
position
among
artistic
forms
whilst
criticism
revels
in
the
beautiful
the
ideal
the
infinite
genius
the
concept
the
idea
truth
the
superintelligible
the
supersensible
the
being
and
the
existent
and
many
more
generalities
cast
into
barbarous
formulæ
just
like
those
of
the
scholastics
from
whose
influence
we
had
so
much
difficulty
in
escaping
all
these
things
instead
of
determining
the
character
of
art
do
nothing
save
illustrate
the
contrary
of
art
its
feebleness
and
impotence
preventing
it
from
slaying
abstractions
and
laying
hold
of
life
if
beauty
and
the
ideal
have
actually
the
meaning
given
them
by
these
philosophers
the
essence
of
art
is
neither
the
beautiful
nor
the
ideal
but
the
living
the
form
the
ugly
too
belongs
to
art
since
ugliness
lives
also
in
nature
outside
the
domain
of
art
lies
nothing
but
the
formless
and
the
deformed

about
the

the

choose
to
call
a

of

world
ugly
granting
it
a
permit
merely
that
it
may
act
as

antagonist
or

is
to

that
which
first
strikes
a

the

the
individual
image
or
form
in
the
herbartian
sense
the
metaphysical
hypostatization
of
the
former
form
is
not
priori
it
is
not
something
existing
of
itself
and
distinct
from
the
content
as
though
it
were
a
kind
of
ornament
or
vesture
or
appearance
or
adjunct
of
the

it
is
generated
by
the

acting
in

of
the

such
as
the

is
such
is
the
form
between
form
and
content
there
is
at
the
same
time
identity
and
diversity
in
a
work
of
art
the
content
which
had
been
lying
in
a
chaotic
state
in
the
mind
of
the
artist
appears
not
as
it
was
originally
but
as
it
has
become
the
whole
of
it
with
its
own
value
its
own
importance
its
own
natural
beauty
enriched
not
weakened
by
the
process
therefore
content
is
essential
for
the
production
of
concrete
form
but
the
abstract
quality
of
the
content
does
not
determine
that
of
artistic
form
if
the
content
though
beautiful
and
important
remain
inoperative
or
lifeless
or
waste
within
the
mind
of
the
artist
if
it
have
not
sufficient
generative
power
and
reveal
itself
in
the

as
weak
or
false
or
vitiated
why
trouble
to
sing
its
praises
in
such
cases
the
content
may
be
important
in
itself
but
as
literature
or
art
it
is
worthless
on
the
other
hand
the
content
may
be
immoral
absurd
false
or
frivolous
but
if
at
certain
times
or
in
certain
circumstances
it
has
worked
powerfully
on
in
the
brain
of
the

firmly
to
the

he
objected
to

exaggeration

in
that
it
tended
to
the
separation
of

from

to

to
the
conversion
of

into

must
be
said
by

seizing

that
is
all

when

you

as
not
to
cut

miserable
a
figure
beside
the

the

at

after
years
of
laborious
effort
and
an

in
the
shape
of
an
ample
history
of
æsthetic
at
length
produced
his

as

this
formalistic
æsthetic
born
under
bad
auspices
is
a
curious
example
of
servile
fidelity
in
externals
combined
with
internal
infidelity
starting
from
unity
or
rather
from
subordination
of
ethics
and
æsthetic
to
a
general
æsthetic
defined
as
a
science
which
treats
of
the
modes
by
which
any

may
acquire
the
right
to
arouse
approval
or
disapproval
thereby
differing
from
metaphysic
science
of
the
real
and
from

of

such
modes
in

that
is
to

in
the
reciprocal
relation
of

a

at
least
now
these
relations
forms
universally
pleasing
can
not
be
empirically
collected
by
induction
they
must
be
developed
by
deduction
by
the
deductive
method
it
can
be
demonstrated
that
the
elements
of
an
image
which
in
themselves
are
representations
may
enter
into
relations
either
according
to
their
force
quantity
or
according
to
their
nature
quality
whence
we
have
two
groups
æsthetic
forms
of
quantity
and
æsthetic
forms
of
quality
according
to
the
first
the
strong
large
is
pleasing
in
comparison
with
the
weak
small
and
these
latter
are
displeasing
when
set
beside
the
former
according
to
the
other
form
that
pleases
which
is
substantially
identical
in
quality
the
harmonious
and
that
displeases
which
is
on
the
whole
diverse
the
discordant
but
the
substantial
identity
must
not
be
pushed
to
the
point
of
absolute
identity
for
in
that
case
the
harmony
itself
would
cease
to
be
from
harmonious
form
is
deduced
the
pleasure
of
the
characteristic
or
expression
for
what
is
the
characteristic
but
a
relation
of
prevalent
identity
between
the
thing
itself
and
its
model
but
while
similarity
prevailing
in
the
distinction
produces
accord
qualitative
disharmony
is
as
such
disagreeable
and
demands
a
resolution
it
is
easy
to
detect
the
sleight
of
hand
with
which
zimmermann
first
slips
the
characteristic
into
the
relations
of
pure
form
thereby
entirely
altering
herbart
original
thought
and
how
by
a
second
trick
he
here
introduces
into
pure
beauty
the
variations
and
modifications
of
the
beautiful
by
the
help
of
the
despised
hegelian
dialectic
if
such
resolution
is
effected
by
the
skilful
substitution
of
something
other
than
the
unpleasant
image
we
shall
certainly
have
removed
the
cause
of
offence
and
established
quietude
not
accord
nicht
but
we
shall
have
gained
the
mere
form
of
correctness
it
is
better
then
to
supersede
this
by
means
of
the
true
image
so
as
to
reach
the
form
of
compensation
and
when
the
true
image
is
also
pleasing
in
itself
the
final
form
of
definitive
compensation
ausgleich
with
which
we
exhaust
the
series
of
possible
forms
and
in
conclusion
what
is
beauty
it
is
a
conjunction
of
all
these
forms
a
model
which
has
grandeur
plenitude
order
accord
correctness
definitive
compensation
all
this
appears
in
a
copy
in
the
form
of
the
characteristic
putting
on
one
side
the
artificial
connexion
zimmermann
makes
between
the
sublime
the
comic
the
tragic
the
ironic
the
humorous
and
the
æsthetic
forms
notice
must
be
taken
so
that
we
may
recognize
into
which
of
the
seven
heavens
he
is
wafting
us
that
these
general
æsthetic
forms
concern
art
equally
with
nature
and
morality
whose
individual
spheres
are
differentiated
solely
by
the
application
of
the
general
æsthetic
forms
to
particular
contents
these
forms
applied
to
nature
give
us
natural
beauty
the
cosmos
applied
to
representation
beauty
of
wit
or
imagination
applied
to
feeling
the
beautiful
soul
or
taste
applied
to
the
will
character
or
virtue
on
one
side
then
is
natural
beauty
on
the
other
human
beauty
in
which
latter
on
one
hand
we
have
the
beauty
of
representation
that
is
to
say
æsthetic
fact
in
the
strict
sense
art
on
the
other
we
have
the
beauty
of
will
or
morality
and
between
the
two
lastly
we
have
taste
common
to
ethics
and
æsthetic
æsthetic
in
the
narrow
sense
as
the
theory
of
beautiful
representation
determines
the
beauty
of
representations
divided
into
the
three
classes
of
the
beauty
of
temporal
and
spatial
connexion
figurative
arts
the
beauty
of
sensitive
representation
music
and
the
beauty
of
thoughts
poetry
this
tripartition
of
beauty
into
figurative
musical
and
poetical
brings
to
a
conclusion
theoretical
æsthetic
the
only
section
developed
by
zimmermann
sidenote
versus
zimmermann
work
was
a
polemic
against
the
principal
representative
of
hegelian
æsthetic
vischer
who
had
little
difficulty
in
defending
his
own
position
and
that
of
his
assailant
he
held
zimmermann
up
to
ridicule
for
example
in
connexion
with
his
view
of
symbolism
zimmermann
defined
a
symbol
as
the
object
round
which
beautiful
forms
adhere
a
painter
depicts
a
fox
simply
for
the
sake
of
painting
a
part
of
animal
nature
nothing
of
the
sort
this
is
a
symbol
because
the
painter
makes
use
of
fines
and
colours
to
express
things
other
than
fines
and
colours
you
think
i
a
fox
says
the
animal
in
the
picture
but
you
make
a
great
mistake
i
a
i
an
appearance
created
by
the
painter
with
gradations
of
grey
white
yellow
and
red
even
easier
was
it
to
make
game
of
zimmermann
enthusiastic
praises
of
the
æsthetic
quality
of
the
sense
of
touch
it
was
a
pity
the
latter
had
written
that
the
pleasures
of
this
sense
were
so
difficult
to
attain
since
to
touch
the
back
of
the
resting
hercules
and
the
sinuous
limbs
of
the
venus
of
melos
or
the
barberini
faun
would
give
to
the
hand
a
delight
comparable
only
with
that
felt
by
the
ear
when
listening
to
the
majestic
fugues
of
bach
or
the
suave
melodies
of
mozart
vischer
does
not
seem
to
be
far
wrong
in
declaring
formalistic
æsthetic
to
be
a
grotesque
union
of
mysticism
and
mathematics
sidenote
the
works
of
zimmermann
seem
to
have
given
satisfaction
to
nobody
save
himself
even
lotze
by
no
means
an
adversary
of
herbartianism
blames
him
severely
in
his
of
æsthetic
in
and
other
writings
still
lotze
was
unable
to
offer
any
better
substitute
for
æsthetic
formalism
than
of
a
variant
of
the
old
idealism
can
any
one
persuade
us
he
wrote
in
criticism
of
the
formalists
that
a
spiritual
discord
expressed
by
a
corresponding
discord
in
external
appearances
may
have
a
value
equal
to
that
of
the
harmonious
expression
of
a
harmonious
content
solely
because
in
both
cases
the
formal
relation
of
accord
is
respected
can
any
one
persuade
us
that
the
human
form
is
pleasing
solely
for
its
formal
stereometric
relations
irrespective
of
the
spiritual
life
by
which
it
is
animated
in
empirical
reality
the
three
domains
of
laws
facts
and
values
invariably
appear
as
divided
and
although
they
are
united
in
the
highest
good
in
goodness
in
itself
in
the
living
love
of
a
personal
god
in
the
ought
which
is
the
basis
of
being
our
reason
is
unable
to
attain
or
to
know
such
union
beauty
alone
can
reveal
it
to
us
it
is
in
close
connexion
with
the
good
and
the
holy
and
reproduces
the
rhythm
of
the
divine
ordinance
and
the
moral
government
of
the
universe
æsthetic
fact
is
neither
intuition
nor
concept
it
is
idea
which
presents
the
essential
of
an
object
in
the
form
of
an
end
referred
to
the
ultimate
end
art
like
beauty
must
include
the
world
of
values
in
the
world
of
forms
the
war
between
the
æsthetic
of
content
and
that
of
form
having
zimmermann
vischer
and
lotze
as
protagonists
reached
its
culminating
point
between
and
sidenote
to
reconcile
æsthetic
of
form
and
æsthetic
of
several
people
were
in
favour
of
a
reconciliation
but
the
reconciliations
they
offered
were
not
the
right
one
which
was
at
least
glimpsed
by
a
certain
young
johann
schmidt
who
in
his
thesis
for
doctorate
observed
that
with
all
respect
for
zimmermann
and
lotze
it
seemed
to
him
they
were
both
wrong
in
confusing
the
various
meanings
of
the
word
beauty
and
discussed
such
an
absurdity
as
a
beauty
or
ugliness
of
natural
objects
that
is
to
say
of
things
external
to
the
spirit
that
lotze
following
hegel
added
the
second
absurdity
of
an
intuitive
concept
or
conceptual
intuition
lastly
that
neither
of
them
grasped
the
fact
that
the
æsthetic
problem
does
not
turn
upon
the
beauty
or
ugliness
of
the
abstract
content
or
of
form
understood
as
a
system
of
mathematical
relations
but
with
the
beauty
or
ugliness
of
representation
form
undoubtedly
must
exist
but
concrete
form
full
of
content
these
utterances
of
schmidt
met
with
a
hostile
reception
it
is
easy
he
was
told
in
reply
to
identify
beauty
with
artistic
perfection
but
the
whole
crux
of
the
matter
lies
in
finding
whether
beside
this
perfection
there
exists
another
beauty
dependent
on
a
supreme
cosmic
or
metaphysical
principle
otherwise
one
is
guilty
of
a
naïve
it
was
thought
better
therefore
to
seek
other
modes
of
reconciliation
which
consisted
in
cooking
up
an
appetizing
dish
in
which
a
little
formalism
and
a
little
contentism
were
mixed
to
taste
the
latter
as
a
rule
giving
the
predominant
flavour
some
herbartians
were
found
in
the
ranks
of
the
mediating
or
conciliatory
party
hardly
had
zimmermann
rigid
formalism
appeared
when
nahlowsky
jumped
up
to
protest
that
it
had
never
entered
the
master
head
to
exclude
content
from
æsthetic
but
even
the
ablest
of
the
school
men
such
as
volkmann
and
lazarus
chose
a
middle
course
in
the
opposite
camp
carrière
and
even
vischer
himself
in
a
criticism
of
his
own
old
began
to
concede
a
larger
part
to
the
consideration
of
form
thus
for
vischer
beauty
became
life
appearing
harmoniously
which
when
it
appears
in
space
is
called
form
and
must
always
possess
form
limitation
in
space
and
time
measure
regularity
symmetry
proportion
propriety
these
characters
constituting
its
quantitative
moments
and
harmony
qualitative
moment
which
includes
variety
and
contrast
and
is
therefore
the
most
important
characteristic
sidenote
a
conciliatory
æsthetic
in
which
formalism
prevailed
was
attempted
by
karl
köstlin
a
professor
at
tübingen
and
formerly
collaborator
in
the
musical
section
of
the
works
of
vischer
köstlin
had
been
influenced
by
schleiermacher
hegel
vischer
and
herbart
but
truth
to
tell
does
not
seem
to
have
perfectly
understood
the
teaching
of
any
one
of
his
predecessors
according
to
him
the
æsthetic
object
presented
three
requirements
richness
and
variety
of
imagery
interesting
content
and
beautiful
form
under
the
first
we
recognize
with
no
little
difficulty
a
distorted
reflexion
of
schleiermacher
inspiration
interesting
content
he
defined
as
that
which
concerns
man
that
which
he
knows
or
does
not
know
that
which
he
loves
or
hates
it
is
thus
always
relative
to
the
individual
and
the
conditions
in
which
he
exists
and
he
asserted
that
interest
of
content
is
joined
to
value
of
form
that
is
he
conceived
content
as
a
second
value
the
same
of
which
we
have
heard
herbart
speak
he
also
agreed
with
herbart
that
form
is
absolute
and
that
its
general
character
is
determined
as
being
easily
perceptible
by
intuition
and
by
its
power
of
giving
satisfaction
pleasure
and
delight
in
fact
as
being
beautiful
its
particular
characteristics
for
köstlin
were
according
to
quantity
circumscription
simplicity
extensive
and
intensive
size
and
equilibrium
according
to
quality
determination
unity
importance
extensive
and
intensive
and
harmony
but
when
köstlin
sets
himself
to
the
empirical
verification
of
his
categories
he
falls
into
hopeless
confusion
greatness
is
pleasing
but
so
is
smallness
unity
is
pleasing
but
so
is
variety
regularity
is
pleasing
but
so
confound
it
is
irregularity
uncertainties
and
contradictions
at
every
step
he
was
aware
of
them
and
made
no
effort
to
conceal
them
but
they
should
have
convinced
him
that
the
abstraction
of
beautiful
form
whose
qualities
and
quantities
he
had
so
laboriously
collected
is
a
ghostly
shape
without
body
since
that
alone
gives
æsthetic
pleasure
which
fulfils
an
expressive
function
but
having
illustrated
the
three
demands
of
the
æsthetic
object
köstlin
wasted
all
his
remaining
breath
in
constructing
a
kingdom
of
intuitive
imagination
in
the
manner
of
vischer
beauty
of
organic
and
inorganic
nature
of
civil
life
of
morality
of
religion
of
science
of
games
of
conversations
of
feasts
and
banquets
and
lastly
of
history
reviewing
and
passing
æsthetic
comment
on
its
three
periods
patriarchal
heroic
and
historical
sidenote
of
content
schasler
who
had
written
as
vast
a
history
on
æsthetic
as
own
found
a
for
a
movement
toward
formalism
in
absolute
idealism
or
as
he
called
it
he
began
by
defining
æsthetic
as
the
science
of
the
beautiful
and
of
art
a
single
science
ill
defined
as
having
two
different
objects
and
proceeded
to
justify
his
unmethodical
definition
by
saying
that
beauty
does
not
exist
in
art
alone
nor
does
art
concern
itself
solely
with
beauty
the
sphere
of
æsthetic
he
defines
as
that
of
intuition
in
which
knowledge
assumes
a
practical
character
and
will
a
theoretical
the
sphere
of
indivisible
unity
and
absolute
reconciliation
of
the
theoretical
and
practical
spirit
in
which
in
a
certain
sense
the
highest
human
activities
are
developed
beauty
is
the
ideal
but
the
concrete
ideal
this
is
why
there
is
no
ideal
of
a
human
body
in
abstraction
from
sex
no
ideal
of
a
mammal
in
general
but
only
of
such
and
such
species
as
of
horse
or
dog
and
then
only
of
determinate
kind
of
horse
or
dog
thus
by
descending
from
the
more
to
the
less
abstract
genus
schasler
vainly
attempted
to
reach
the
concrete
which
inevitably
escaped
his
grasp
in
art
we
pass
from
the
typical
which
is
natural
beauty
to
the
characteristic
which
is
the
typical
of
human
feeling
hence
we
can
frame
the
ideal
of
an
old
woman
a
beggar
or
a
ruffian
the
characteristic
of
art
is
in
closer
relationship
to
the
ugly
than
to
the
beautiful
in
nature
on
this
head
passing
over
the
remainder
which
is
on
familiar
lines
it
is
well
to
notice
that
schasler
has
a
bias
towards
that
version
of
the
romaunt
of
sir
purebeauty
which
ascribes
the
birth
of
the
modifications
of
beauty
to
the
influence
of
the
ugly
although
he
writes
the
thought
may
disturb
our
minds
it
must
not
be
forgotten
that
were
there
no
world
of
ugliness
there
could
be
no
world
of
beauty
for
it
is
only
when
the
ugly
stirs
up
empty
abstract
beauty
that
it
begins
to
combat
the
enemy
and
thus
to
produce
concrete
beauty
he
even
succeeded
in
converting
vischer
himself
the
chief
supporter
of
the
other
version
formerly
i
had
been
accustomed
to
think
in
the
hegelian
style
vischer
confesses
that
unrest
fermentation
and
strife
dwelt
in
the
essence
of
beauty
that
the
idea
prevails
and
thrusts
the
image
forth
into
the
infinite
so
arises
the
sublime
that
the
image
offended
in
its
finitude
makes
war
on
the
idea
whence
arises
the
comic
this
finished
the
struggle
beauty
returned
to
itself
from
the
conflict
of
the
two
moments
and
was
created
but
now
he
continues
i
must
acknowledge
that
schasler
is
right
and
so
are
his
predecessors
weisse
and
ruge
the
ugly
has
a
hand
in
the
matter
this
is
the
principle
of
movement
the
ferment
of
differentiation
without
such
leaven
we
never
reach
the
special
forms
of
beauty
for
each
single
one
presupposes
the
ugly
sidenote
von
closely
allied
to
that
of
schasler
is
the
æsthetic
of
eduard
von
hartmann
preceded
by
a
historical
treatise
on
æsthetic
since
wherein
with
meticulous
critical
and
polemical
study
he
upholds
the
definition
of
beauty
as
the
appearance
of
the
idea
scheinen
der
inasmuch
as
he
insisted
on
appearance
as
the
necessary
characteristic
of
beauty
hartmann
held
himself
justified
in
naming
his
æsthetic
the
æsthetic
of
concrete
idealism
and
in
ranging
himself
alongside
hegel
trahndorff
schleiermacher
deutinger
oersted
vischer
meising
carrière
and
schasler
against
the
abstract
idealism
of
schelling
solger
schopenhauer
krause
weisse
and
lotze
all
of
whom
by
placing
beauty
in
the
supersensible
idea
overlooked
the
sensory
element
and
reduced
it
to
the
rank
of
a
mere
accessory
by
his
insistence
on
the
idea
as
the
other
indispensable
and
determining
element
hartmann
proclaimed
himself
as
opposed
to
the
herbartian
formalism
beauty
is
truth
neither
historical
scientific
nor
reflective
but
metaphysical
or
idealistic
the
very
truth
of
philosophy
in
proportion
as
beauty
is
in
opposition
to
every
science
and
to
realistic
truth
so
much
nearer
is
it
to
philosophy
and
metaphysical
truth
beauty
with
its
own
peculiar
efficacy
remains
the
prophet
of
idealistic
truth
in
an
unbelieving
age
that
abhors
metaphysic
and
recognizes
no
value
in
anything
but
realistic
truth
æsthetic
truth
which
leaps
immediately
from
subjective
appearance
to
ideal
essence
is
lacking
in
the
control
and
method
possessed
by
philosophical
truth
in
compensation
however
she

the

the

passage
through
the
world
of
the
senses
and
of
science
and
the
slighter
becomes
the
distance
separating
philosophy
and
art
the
latter
for
its
part
will
be
well
advised
to
start
on
its
journey
towards
the
ideal
world
as

the

from

lowest
among
the
degrees
of

indeed
forming
the
lower
limit
of
æsthetic

lies
sensuous
pleasure
which
is
unconscious
formal

its

its

its

of
the
third

the
passive

as
in
the
case
of

indeed
it
may
here
be
noted
that
among
machines
and
utensils
on
a
level
with

and

hartmann
placed

only
at

concrete
beauty
or
the
microcosmic
individual
which
is
no
longer
formal
but
beauty
of
content
as
is
to
be
expected
the
passage
from
lower
to
higher
degrees
is
made
by
means
of
the
ugly
nobody
has
laboured
like
hartmann
to
recount
in
detail
the
services
rendered
by
ugliness
to
beauty
from
ugliness
in
the
form
of
the
destruction
of
the
beauty
of
equality
arises
symmetry
from
ugliness
in
the
case
of
the
circle
arises
the
ellipse
the
beauty
of
a
waterfall
tumbling
over
rocks
is
caused
by
the
mathematically
ugly
destruction
that
is
to
say
of
a
fall
in
a
parabolic
curve
beauty
of
spiritual
expression
is
achieved
through
the
introduction
of
an
ugliness
relative
to
fleshly
perfection
beauty
of
a
higher
degree
is
founded
on
ugliness
at
a
lower
degree
when
the
highest
degree
is
reached
that
of
individual
beauty
beyond
which
there
can
be
nothing
even
then
elemental
ugliness
continues
its
work
of
beneficent
irritation
the
later
phases
thus
produced
are
well
known
to
us
as
the
famous
modifications
of
the
beautiful
in
this
section
also
nobody
is
so
copious
or
detailed
as
hartmann
he
certainly
does
admit
side
by
side
with
simple
or
pure
beauty
certain
modifications
free
from
conflict
such
as
the
sublime
or
graceful
but
the
more
important
modifications
can
arise
only
through
conflict
there
are
four
cases
because
the
resolution
must
be
either
immanent
logical
transcendent
or
combined
immanent
in
the
idyllic
the
melancholy
the
sad
the
cheerful
the
moving
the
elegiac
logical
in
the
comic
in
all
its
varieties
transcendent
in
the
tragic
combined
in
the
humorous
with
the
and
its
other
varieties
when
none
of
these
resolutions
is
possible
there
arises
ugliness
when
an
ugliness
of
content
is
expressed
by
an
ugliness
of
form
we
have
the
maximum
of
ugliness
the
real
æsthetic
devil
sidenote
æsthetic
in
france
hartmann
is
the
last
considerable
representative
of
the
old
æsthetic
school
in
germany
he
inspires
terror
by
the
mass
of
his
literary
production
like
many
others
of
the
school
who
seem
to
accept
it
as
a
dogma
that
art
can
not
be
dealt
with
except
in
several
volumes
a
thousand
pages
long
those
who
are
not
afraid
of
giants
and
are
able
to
attack
this
sort
of
æsthetic
will
find
it
a
fat
magog
full
of
vulgar
prejudices
and
so
constituted
that
despite
his
apparent
strength
a
little
blow
will
kill
him
in
other
countries
metaphysical
æsthetic
had
few
followers
in
france
the
celebrated
competition
of
the
academy
of
moral
and
political
sciences
in
crowned
with
their
approval
and
presented
to
the
world
the
of
by
levêque
of
which
nobody
now
thinks
or
speaks
only
remembering
the
author
who
attitudinized
as
a
disciple
of
plato
by
his
eight
characteristics
of
beauty
derived
by
him
from
examination
of
a
lily
the
eight
characteristics
were
as
follows
sufficient
size
of
form
unity
variety
harmony
proportion
normal
vivacity
of
colour
grace
and
propriety
ultimately
reducible
to
two
size
and
order
as
supplementary
proof
of
the
truth
of
his
theory
levêque
applied
it
to
three
beautiful
things
a
child
playing
with
its
mother
a
symphony
of
beethoven
and
the
life
of
a

socrates
really
it
is
somewhat
difficult
says
one
of
his
venturing
to
comment
on
this
doctrine
though
speaking
with
the
utmost
deference
to
imagine
what
may
be
the
normal
vivacity
of

in
the

not

sidenote
england
england
showed
even
less
disposition
to
interest
herself
although
john
ruskin
may
have
some
claim
to
be
considered
a
metaphysical
æsthetician
with
a
distinctive
national
stamp
but
it
is
difficult
to
treat
of
ruskin
in
a
history
of
science
for
his
temperament
was
wholly
opposed
to
the
scientific
his
disposition
was
that
of
the
artist
impressionable
excitable
voluble
rich
in
feeling
a
dogmatic
tone
and
the
appearance
of
theoretical
form
veil
in
his
exquisite
and
enthusiastic
pages
a
texture
of
dreams
and
fancies
the
reader
who
recalls
those
pages
will
regard
as
irreverent
any
detailed
and
prosaic
review
of
ruskin
æsthetic
thought
which
must
inevitably
reveal
its
poverty
and
incoherence
suffice
it
to
say
that
following
a
finalistic
mystical
intuition
of
nature
he
considered
beauty
as
a
revelation
of
divine
intentions
the
seal
god
sets
on
his
works
even
upon
the
smallest
for
him
the
faculty
which
perceives
the
beautiful
is
neither
intellect
nor
sensibility
but
a
particular
feeling
which
he
names
the
theoretic
faculty
natural
beauty
which
reveals
itself
to
a
pure
heart
when
contemplating
any
object
untouched
and
unspoiled
by
the
hand
of
man
asserts
itself
for
this
reason
as
immeasurably
superior
to
any
work
of
art
ruskin
was
too
hasty
in
analysis
to
understand
the
complicated
psychological
and
æsthetic
process
which
went
on
in
his
mind
when
he
was
moved
to
an
artist
ecstasy
by
contemplating
some
humble
natural
object
such
as
a
bird
nest
or
a
flowing
rivulet
sidenote
in
in
italy
the
abate
tornasi
wrote
a
æsthetic
wherein
the
beautiful
is
identified
with
the
second
person
of
the
trinity
the
word
made
man
by
this
means
he
hoped
to
raise
a
bank
of
opposition
against
the
liberal
criticism
of
de
sanctis
whom
he
considered
from
the
sublime
height
of
his
own
philosophy
as
a
subtle
grammarian
combined
giobertian
and
german
especially

somewhat
later
gallo
also
treated
æsthetic
from
the
hegelian
point
of
view
and
others
repeated
nearly
word
for
word
the
doctrines
of
schasler
and
hartmann
on
the
overcoming
of
the
ugly
sidenote
tari
and
his
the
only
genuine
italian
teacher
of
metaphysical
æsthetic
according
to
the
germans
was
antonio
tari
who
lectured
on
this
very
subject
in
naples
university
from
to
he
had
a
meticulous
and
superstitiously
minute
knowledge
of
everything
that
issued
from
german
and
was
the
author
of
an
as
well
as
essays
on
style
taste
serious
work
and
play
music
and
architecture
wherein
he
tried
to
keep
the
mean
between
the
idealism
of
hegel
and
the
formalism
of
herbart
his
lectures
on
æsthetic
attracted
huge
throngs
and
were
one
of
the
regular
sights
in
the
noisy
crowded
neapolitan
university
tari
divided
his
treatment
under
three
heads
æsthesinomy
æsthesigraphy
and
æsthesipraxis
corresponding
to
the
metaphysic
of
the
beautiful
to
the
doctrine
of
beauty
in
nature
and
to
that
of
beauty
in
art
like
the
german
idealists
he
defined
the
æsthetic
sphere
as
intermediate
between
the
theoretical
and
practical
he
says
emphatically
that
in
the
world
of
spirit
the
temperate
zone
is
equidistant
from
the
glacial
peopled
by
the
esquimaux
of
thought
and
from
the
torrid
peopled
by
the
giants
of
action
he
pulled
beauty
from
her
throne
substituting
in
her
stead
the
æsthetic
of
which
beauty
is
but
an
initial
moment
the
simple
beginning
of
æsthetic
life
eternal
mortality
flower
and
fruit
in
one
whose
successive
moments
are
represented
by
the
sublime
the
comic
the
humorous
and
the
dramatic
sidenote
but
the
most
attractive
part
of
tari
lectures
was
that
devoted
to
æsthesigraphy
subdivided
into
cosmography
physiography
and
psychography
in
the
course
of
which
he
frequently
quoted
vischer
with
great
devotion
the
great
vischer
as
he
called
him
in
imitation
of
whom
he
constructed
his
own
æsthetic
physics
brightening
it
with
much
varied
erudition
and
enlivening
it
with
quaint
comparisons
is
he
speaking
of
beauty
in
inorganic
nature
water
for
example
he
says
in
his
fanciful
manner
when
water
ripples
in
the
sunshine
in
that
act
it
has
its
smile
it
has
its
frown
in
the
breaking
wave
its
caprice
in
the
fountain
its
majestic
fury
in
the
foam
is
he
speaking
of
geological
configuration
the

perchance
of
the
human
race

idyllic
the
plain
monotonous
but
fat
is
didactic
of

the
apotheosis
of
human
toil
achieves
greatness
the
former
boasts
of
its
cradle
when
it
does
not
bring
it
to
dishonour
the
latter
causes
it
to
be
forgotten
he
looked
on
vegetable
life
as
a
dream
repeating
herder
fine
saying
that
the
plant
is
the
babe
that
hangs
sucking
upon
the
breast
of

nature
he
divided
vegetables
into
three
types
foliaceous
ramified
and
umbelliferous
the
foliaceous
type
he
says
attains
gigantic
proportions
in
the
tropics
where
the
queen
of
monocotyledons
the
represents
despotism
the
human
scourge
of
those
desert
regions
of
that
solitary
pinnacle
all
crown
the
negro
may
well
be
identified
as
the
reptile
that
crawls
round
its
base
amongst
flowers
the
carnation
is
symbol
of
betrayal
by
reason
of
the
variegation
of
its
colours
and
its
petals
the
celebrated
comparison
by
ariosto
of
a
rose
with
a
young
girl
is
permissible
only
when
the
flower
is
still
in
bud
because
when
it
has
unfolded
its
petals
disdaining
the
protection
of
thorns
displaying
itself
in
all
the
pomp
of
its
full
colour
and
boldly
asking
to
be
plucked
by
any
hand
then
it
is
woman
all
woman
to
call
it
by
no
harsher
name
giving
pleasure
without
feeling
it
simulating
love
by
its
perfume
and
modesty
by
the
crimson
of
its
petals
he
searches
for
and
comments
upon
analogies
between
certain
fruits
and
certain
flowers
between
the
strawberry
for
instance
and
the
violet
between
the
orange
and
the
rose

admired
the
luxuriant
spirals

rough

primitive
isolation
the

noted
with
michelet
that
the

is
a
living
paralogism
it
can
not
feed
itself
without
its
web
and
it
can
not
spin
its

he
condemns
as
they
are
of
stupid
appearance
with
their
wide
open
eyes
and
incessant
gaping
which
makes
them
look
voraciously
gluttonous

in
the
latter
half
of
the
nineteenth
century
by
positivistic
and
evolutionary
metaphysic
a
confused
substitution
of
natural
for
philosophical
sciences
and
a
of
materialistic
and
idealistic
mechanical
and
theological
theories
the
whole
crowned
with
scepticism
and
agnosticism
characteristic
of
this
trend
of
opinion
was
its
contempt
of
history
especially
the
history
of
philosophy
which
prevented
its
ever
making
that
contact
with
the
unbroken
and
efforts
of
thinkers
without
which
it
is
idle
to
hope
for
fertile
work
and
true
progress
of
spencer
the
greatest
positivist
of
his
day
whilst
discussing
æsthetic
actually
did
not
know
that
he
was
dealing
with
problems
for
all
or
almost
all
of
which
solutions
had
been
already
proposed
and
discussed
at
the
beginning
of
his
essay
on
the
of
style
he
remarks
innocently
i
believe
nobody
has
ever
sketched
a
general
theory
of
the
art
of
writing
in
and
in
his
of
touching
the
æsthetic
feelings
he
remarks
that
he
has
some
recollection
of
observations
concerning
the
relation
of
art
and
play
made
by
some
german
author
whose
name
i
can
not
recall
schiller
had
his
pages
on
æsthetic
been
written
in
the
seventeenth
century
they
would
have
won
a
low
position
amongst
the
early
crude
attempts
at
æsthetic
speculation
in
the
nineteenth
century
one
knows
not
how
to
judge
them
in
his
essay
on
useful
and
the
he
shows
how
the
useful
becomes
beautiful
when
it
ceases
to
be
useful
illustrating
this
by
a
ruined
castle
useless
for
the
purposes
of
modern
life
but
a
suitable
scene
for
picnic
parties
and
a
good
subject
for
a
picture
to
hang
on
a
parlour
wall
which
leads
him
to
identify
the
principle
of
evolution
from
the
useful
to
the
beautiful
as
contrast
in
another
essay
on
the
of
the
human
he
explains
this
beauty
as
a
sign
and
effect
of
moral
goodness
in
that
on
he
considers
the
sentiment
of
the
graceful
as
sympathy
for
power
in
conjunction
with
agility
in
the
of
architectural
he
discovers
the
beauty
of
architecture
as
consisting
in
uniformity
and
symmetry
an
idea
which
is
aroused
in
a
man
looking
at
the
bodily
equilibrium
of
the
higher
animals
or
as
in
gothic
architecture
by
analogy
with
the
vegetable
kingdom
in
his
essay
on
he
places
the
cause
of
stylistic
beauty
in
economy
of
effort
in
his
and
function
of
he
theorizes
on
music
as
the
natural
language
of
the
passions
adapted
to
increase
sympathy
between
men
in
his
of
psychology
he
maintains
that
the
æsthetic
feelings
arise
from
the
overflow
of
exuberant
energy
in
the
organism
and
distinguishes
various
degrees
of
them
from
simple
sensation
to
that
accompanied
by
representative
elements
and
so
on
until
perception
is
reached
with
more
complex
elements
of
representation
then
emotion
and
last
of
all
that
state
of
consciousness
which
transcends
sensation
and
perception
the
most
perfect
form
of
æsthetic
feeling
is
attained
by
the
coincidence
of
the
three
orders
of
pleasures
a
coincidence
produced
by
the
full
action
of
their
respective
faculties
with
the
least
possible
subtraction
due
to
the
painful
effect
of
excessive
activity
but
it
is
very
rarely
that
we
experience
æsthetic
excitement
of
this
kind
and
strength
almost
all
works
of
art
are
imperfect
because
they
contain
a
mixture
of
artistic
with
effects
now
the
technique
is
unsatisfactory
now
the
emotion
is
of
a
low
order
these
works
of
art
which
are
universally
admired
are
found
when
measured
by
this
criterion
to
deserve
a
lower
place
than
that
accorded
them
by
popular
taste
beginning
with
the
greek
epic
and
the
representations
of
analogous
legends
given
by
their
sculptors
tending
to
excite
egoistic
or
sentiments
and
passing
through
the
literature
of
the
middle
ages
equally
impregnated
with
inferior
sentiments
then
through
the
works
of
the
old
masters
whose
ideas
and
sentiments
seldom
compensate
for
the
displeasing
effect
they
inflict
on
our
senses
overrefined
in
study
of
appearances
and
coming
at
last
to
the
vaunted
works
of
modern
art
excellent
for
technical
execution
in
many
cases
but
deplorable
for
the
emotions
they
arouse
and
express
such
as
gérôme
alternately
sensual
and
sanguinary
they
are
all
far
off
indeed
from
the
qualities
deemed
desirable
from
the
artistic
forms
corresponding
to
the
highest
forms
of
æsthetic
feeling
these
last
critical
denunciations
like
the
theories
noticed
above
are
mere
substitutions
of
one
word
for
another
facility
for
grace
economy
for
beauty
and
so
on
indeed
when
one
tries
to
define
the
exact
philosophical
position
of
spencer
one
can
only
possibly
say
that
he
wavers
between
sensationalism
and
moralism
and
is
never
for
a
moment
conscious
of
art
as
art
sidenote
of
æsthetic
grant
allen
helmholtz
and
the
same
oscillation
is
noticeable
in
other
english
writers
such
as
sully
and
bain
in
whom
however
we
find
more
familiarity
with
works
of
art
in
his
numerous
essays
and
in
grant
allen
collected
a
great
many
records
of
physiological
experiments
all
of
which
may
be
of
supreme
value
to
physiology
for
aught
we
know
to
the
contrary
but
most
assuredly
are
worthless
from
the
point
of
view
of
æsthetic
he
keeps
to
the
distinction
between
necessary
or
vital
activity
and
the
superfluous
or
that
of
play
and
defines
æsthetic
pleasure
as
the
subjective
concomitant
of
the
normal
sum
of
activity
not
connected
directly
with
the
vital
functions
in
the
terminal
peripheric
organs
of
the
cerebrospinal
nervous
system
physiological
processes
considered
as
causes
of
pleasure
in
art
are
presented
under
other
aspects
by
later
investigators
who
assert
that
such
pleasure
arises
not
only
from
the
activity
of
the
visual
organs
and
the
muscular
systems
associated
with
them
but
also
from
the
participation
of
some
of
the
more
important
functions
of
the
organism
as
for
instance
breathing
circulation
of
the
blood
equilibrium
and
internal
muscular
accommodation
art
then
indubitably
originated
in
a
prehistoric
man
who
was
habitually
a
having
no
call
to
rearrange
his
natural
habits
when
scratching
lines
on
bones
or
in
mud
and
taking
pains
to
draw
them
regularly
spaced
researches
were
pursued
in
germany
by
helmholtz
brücke
and
stumpf
who
generally
confined
themselves
to
the
narrower
field
of
optics
and
acoustics
giving
descriptions
of
the
physical
processes
of
artistic
technique
and
the
conditions
to
which
pleasurable
visual
and
auditive
impressions
must
conform
without
claiming
to
merge
æsthetic
in
physics
but
even
pointing
out
the
divergences
between
them
degenerate
herbartians
hastened
to
disguise
in
physiological
terms
the
metaphysical
forms
and
relations
of
which
their
master
had
spoken
and
to
coquet
with
the
hedonism
of
the
naturalists
sidenote
of
the
natural
sciences
in
the
superstitious
cult
of
natural
sciences
was
often
accompanied
as
is
frequently
the
fate
of
superstition
by
a
sort
of
hypocrisy
chemical
physical
and
physiological
laboratories
became
sybilline
grottoes
resounding
with
the
questions
of
credulous
inquirers
concerning
the
profoundest
problems
of
the
human
spirit
and
many
of
those
who
were
really
conducting
their
inquiries
on
inherently
philosophic
principles
pretended
or
deluded
themselves
into
believing
that
they
followed
the
method
of
natural
science
a
proof
of
this
illusion
or
pretence
is
hippolyte
taine
of
sidenote
taine
if
by
studying
the
art
of
various
peoples
and
various
epochs
says
taine
we
could
define
the
nature
and
establish
the
conditions
of
the
existence
of
each
art
we
should
have
arrived
at
a
complete
explanation
of
the
fine
arts
and
of
art
in
general
at
what
is
called
an
æsthetic
a
historical
æsthetic
not
a
dogmatic
which
fixes
characters
and
indicates
laws
like
botany
and
studies
with
equal
attention
orange
and
ivy
pine
and
birch
indeed
it
is
a
sort
of
botanical
science
applied
to
the
works
of
man
instead
of
to
plants
an
æsthetic
which
shall
follow
the
general
movement
which
tends
daily
more
and
more
to
join
the
moral
to
the
natural
sciences
and
by
extending
to
the
former
the
principles
the
safeguards
and
the
rules
of
the
latter
enables
both
to
attain
the
same
security
and
maintain
the
same
progress
the
naturalistic
prelude
is
followed
by
definitions
and
doctrines
indistinguishable
from
those
offered
by
philosophers
whose
infallibility
is
not
guaranteed
by
scientific
methods
indeed
from
those
of
the
wildest
of
such
philosophers
for
says
taine
art
is
imitation
an
imitation
so
carried
out
as
to
render
sensible
the
essential
character
of
objects
the
essential
character
being
a
quality
from
which
all
other
qualities
or
many
others
are
derived
and
follow
unalterably
from
it
the
essential
character
of
a
lion
for
example
is
to
be
a
great
carnivore
this
determines
the
formation
of
all
its
limbs
the
essential
character
of
holland
is
to
be
a
country
formed
by
alluvial
soil
this
is
why
art
is
not
restricted
to
objects
existing
in
reality
but
is
able
as
in
architecture
or
in
music
to
represent
essential
characters
without
natural
objects
to
correspond
sidenote
metaphysic
and
now
in
what
do
these
essential
characters
this
carnivorosity
and
this
alluviality
differ
save
perhaps
in
extravagance
of
example
from
the
types
and
ideas
which
intellectualiste
or
metaphysical
æsthetic
had
always
considered
as
the
proper
content
of
art
taine
himself
clears
away
every
doubt
in
the
matter
by
explicitly
stating
that
this
character
is
what
philosophers
call
the
of
things
in
virtue
of
which
they
affirm
that
the
aim
and
end
of
art
is
to
make
manifest
the
essence
of
things
he
adds
that
for
his
part
he
refuses
to
make
use
of
the
word
as
being
a
technical
term
of
the
word
itself
maybe
not
of
the
concept
for
which
it
stands
there
are
two
ways
says
taine
for
all
the
world
as
though
he
were
a
schelling
leading
to
the
higher
life
of
man
to
contemplation
the
way
of
science
and
the
way
of
art
the
former
investigates
the
causes
and
fundamental
laws
of
reality
and
expresses
them
in
exact
formulæ
and
abstract
terms
the
latter
makes
manifest
these
causes
and
laws
not
in
dry
definitions
inaccessible
to
the
vulgar
and
intelligible
only
to
the
select
few
but
in
a
sensible
manner
appealing
not
merely
to
the
reason
but
to
the
heart
and
senses
of
the
most
commonplace
man
it
has
the
power
of
being
both
elevated
and
popular
of
manifesting
what
is
most
noble
and
elevated
and
of
manifesting
it
to
every
one
for
taine
as
for
the
hegelian
æstheticians
works
of
art
are
arranged
in
a
scale
of
values
so
that
having
begun
by
condemning
as
absurd
every
judgement
of
taste
every
one
to
his
taste
he
ends
by
asserting
that
personal
taste
has
no
value
whatever
and
that
some
common
measure
should
be
abstracted
and
set
up
as
a
standard
of
progress
and
retrogression
ornamentation
and
degeneracy
a
standard
by
which
to
approve
and
disapprove
praise
and
blame
the
scale
of
values
set
up
by
him
is
twofold
or
threefold
in
the
first
instance
it
turns
on
the
degree
of
importance
of
the
character
the
greater
or
less
generality
in
idea
and
the
degree
of
beneficent
effect
de
the
greater
or
less
moral
value
of
the
representation
two
grades
which
are
aspects
of
one
single
quality
viz
power
considered
first
for
its
own
sake
and
then
in
its
connexion
with
others
in
the
second
instance
upon
the
degree
of
convergence
of
effects
the
fulness
of
expression
the
harmony
between
idea
and
form
this
intellectualistic
moralistic
rhetorical
doctrine
is
interrupted
now
and
then
by
the
usual
naturalistic
protests
we
shall
according
to
our
custom
study
this
question
in
the
manner
of
the
natural
scientist
that
is
to
say
methodically
by
analysis
hoping
to
raise
not
merely
a
song
of
praise
but
a
code
of
laws
etc
as
though
that
sufficed
to
alter
the
substance
of
the
method
adopted
and
the
doctrine
expounded
taine
finally
gave
himself
over
to
dialectical
treatments
and
solutions
and
asserted
that
in
the
primitive
period
of
italian
art
in
the
pictures
of
giotto
we
have
soul
without
body
thesis
under
the
renaissance
in
verrocchio
pictures
body
without
soul
antithesis
in
the
sixteenth
century
in
raphæl
there
is
harmony
of
expression
and
anatomy
soul
and
body
synthesis
sidenote
feckner
inductive
the
same
protests
and
similar
methods
are
to
be
found
in
the
works
of
gustav
theodor
fechner
in
his
to
fechner
claims
to
abandon
the
attempt
at
conceptual
determination
of
the
objective
essence
of
beauty
since
he
desires
to
compose
not
a
metaphysical
æsthetic
from
above
but
an
inductive
æsthetic
from
below
unten
and
to
achieve
clearness
not
sublimity
metaphysical
æsthetic
should
bear
the
same
relation
to
inductive
as
the
philosophy
of
nature
to
physics
proceeding
on
inductive
lines
he
discovers
a
long
series
of
æsthetic
laws
or
principles
the
æsthetic
threshold
assistance
or
increment
unity
in
variety
absence
of
contradictions
clarity
association
contrast
consequence
conciliation
the
correct
mean
economic
use
persistency
change
measure
and
so
on
without
end
this
chaos
of
concepts
he
expounds
with
a
chapter
apiece
pleased
and
proud
to
show
himself
so
highly
scientific
and
so
wholly
inconclusive
sidenote
next
he
describes
the
experiments
he
can
recommend
to
his
readers
they
are
of
this
type
take
ten
rectangular
pieces
of
white
cardboard
of
fairly
equal
area
say
ten
square
inches
but
with
sides
variously
proportioned
from
a
ratio
of
to
one
of
including
the
ratio
of
the
golden
section
mix
all
these
together
on
a
black
table
and
collect
persons
of
every
kind
and
character
but
all
belonging
to
the
educated
classes
and
applying
the
method
of
choice
ask
these
people
first
to
free
their
minds
of
all
questions
as
to
a
particular
use
and
then
to
pick
out
the
pieces
of
cardboard
which
give
them
the
highest
sensation
of
pleasure
and
those
which
inspire
them
with
the
strongest
feelings
of
disgust
the
answers
to
be
most
carefully
noted
keeping
male
and
female
subjects
apart
and
tabulated
then
see
what
follows
fechner
admits
that
the
chosen
often
made
reservations
when
questioned
by
himself
not
knowing
very
naturally
how
to
tell
whether
they
liked
a
shape
or
disliked
it
without
referring
it
to
a
definite
use
sometimes
they
refused
to
make
any
selection
at
all
and
they
almost
always
seemed
vague
and
perplexed
in
mind
and
generally
when
submitted
to
a
second
test
answered
in
a
way
totally
different
from
the
first
still
we
all
know
that
errors
cancel
out
and
anyhow
the
tabulations
showed
that
the
highest
sensations
of
delight
were
aroused
not
by
the
square
but
by
rectangular
forms
most
nearly
approaching
the
square
an
enthusiastic
rush
being
made
for
the
proportion
this
method
of
selection
received
an
extraordinarily
felicitous
definition
it
was
known
as
an
average
of
arbitrary
judgements
by
an
arbitrary
number
of
persons
arbitrarily
selected
fechner
also
informs
us
always
in
tabular
form
of
the
result
of
a
statistical
inquiry
of
his
own
by
means
of
countless
heaps
of
catalogues
and
as
to
the
dimensions
and
shapes
of
pictures
in
relation
to
the
subjects
they
depict
sidenote
nature
of
his
ideas
on
beauty
and
nevertheless
when
he
tries
to
tell
us
what
beauty
is
he
falls
back
on
using
whether
well
or
ill
the
old
speculative
method
which
he
prefaces
with
the
remark
that
for
him
the
concept
of
beauty
is
merely
an
expedient
in
conformity
with
linguistic
usage
for
indicating
briefly
the
link
which
unites
the
prevailing
conditions
of
immediate
pleasure
he
distinguishes
three
meanings
of
the
word
beauty
first
in
a
broad
sense
the
pleasing
in
general
secondly
in
a
narrow
sense
a
higher
pleasure
but
still
sensuous
thirdly
in
the
narrowest
sense
true
beauty
which
not
only
pleases
but
has
the
right
of
pleasing
possesses
value
in
pleasing
in
it
are
united
the
concepts
of
beauty
the
pleasing
and
of
goodness
beauty
in
fact
is
that
which
must
please
objectively
and
as
such
it
corresponds
with
the
good
of
action
the
good
says
fechner
is
like
a
serious
man
the
capable
organiser
of
his
whole
domestic
life
sagaciously
weighing
the
present
and
future
setting
himself
to
extract
the
greatest
benefit
from
both
beauty
is
his
florid
spouse
careful
of
the
present
and
mindful
of
her
husband
wishes
the
pleasing
is
the
baby
all
senses
and
play
the
useful
is
the
servant
who
puts
his
hands
at
his
disposal
and
is
given
bread

is
to
be
found
in

of

into

which
he
dismisses
under
the
title
of

grosse
invokes
a
science
of

wissenschaft
whose
mission
is
to
dig
out
all
the
laws
lying
hidden
in
the
mass
of
historical
facts
collected
to
date
it
is
his
opinion
that
all
ethnographic
and
prehistoric
material
should
be
united
to
historical
matter
proper
there
being
no
possibility
according
to
him
of
framing
general
laws
when
study
is
restricted
to
the
art
of
cultured
peoples
just
as
a
theory
of
generation
must
necessarily
be
imperfect
if
founded
exclusively
on
the
form
of
that
function
predominant
among
mammals
but
immediately
after
his
declaration
of
abhorrence
for
philosophy
and
of
faith
in
scientific
methods
grosse
finds
himself
in
the
same
difficulty
as
taine
and
fechner
indeed
there
is
no
escape
in
order
to
examine
the
artistic
productions
of
primitive
and
savage
peoples
a
start
must
be
made
from
some
sort
of
concept
of
art
all
the
scientific
metaphors
all
the
verbal
emollients
employed
by
grosse
can
not
hide
the
nature
of
the
plan
he
is
forced
to
adopt
or
its
striking
resemblance
to
the
despised
speculative
æsthetic
as
a
traveller
who
desires
to
explore
an
unknown
land
must
provide
himself
with
a
general
outline
of
the
country
and
have
some
knowledge
of
the
direction
in
which
his
path
should
lie
if
he
does
not
wish
to
lose
his
way
entirely
so
we
before
beginning
our
enquiry
need
a
general
preliminary
orientation
concerning
the
essence
of
the
phenomena
das
wesen
der
about
to
engage
our
attention
most
certainly
we
may
count
upon
having
an
exact
and
exhaustive
answer
at
earliest
when
our
enquiry
is
finished
and
it
is
not
yet
begun
that
characteristic
which
we
seek
to
determine
at
the
outset
may
be
most
radically
modified
by
the
time
we
reach
the
end
there
is
no
question
fie
on
the
suggestion
of
imitating
the
old
æstheticians
the
only
question
is
how
to
give
a
definition
which
may
serve
as
provisional
scaffolding
to
be
broken
away
on
completion
of
the
edifice
words
words
words
the
mite
of
general
ideas
and
artistic
laws
to
be
found
in
his
book
has
been
quarried
by
grosse
not
from
study
of
the
reports
brought
back
by
travellers
in
savage
lands
but
from
speculation
on
the
forms
of
the
spirit
and
inevitably
his
interpretation
of
the
former
is
reached
by
the
light
thrown
on
it
by
the
latter
in
his
final
definition
grosse
concludes
by
considering
art
as
an
activity
which
in
its
development
or
as
its
result
possesses
immediate
and
is
an
end
to
itself
practical
and
æsthetic
activity
are
in
direct
mutual
opposition
between
which
as
a
middle
term
lies
the
activity
of
play
which
like
the
practical
activity
has
its
end
outside
itself
but
like
the
æsthetic
finds
its
enjoyment
not
in
its
external
end
which
is
more
or
less
insignificant
but
in
its
own
activity
at
the
end
of
his
book
he
remarks
that
the
artistic
activity
of
primitive
peoples
is
hardly
ever
unaccompanied
by
the
practical
and
that
art
began
by
being
social
and
became
individual
only
in
civilized
times
the
æsthetics
of
taine
and
grosse
have
also
been
described
by
the
epithet
sociological
sidenote
but
since
no
one
knows
what
the
science
of
sociology
is
we
must
deal
with
the
sociological
superstition
as
we
dealt
with
the
naturalistic
that
is
to
say
by
skipping
the
preface
with
its
proposals
that
can
never
be
carried
out
and
seeing
what
it
is
that
the
objective
necessities
of
the
case
have
forced
the
author
to
assert
and
which
of
the
possible
alternative
views
he
accepts
or
between
what
selection
of
them
his
allegiance
wavers
during
this
examination
we
shall
ignore
the
fairly
common
case
of
an
author
who
while
pretending
to
construct
an
æsthetic
simply
compiles
a
list
of
facts
connected
with
the
history
of
art
or
civilization
sidenote
some
social
reformers
of
our
day
like
proudhon
have
revived
the
condemnations
of
plato
or
the
mitigated
moralism
of
antiquity
and
the
middle
ages
proudhon
denied
the
formula
art
for
art
sake
he
looked
on
art
as
a
mere
purveyor
of
sensuous
pleasure
something
which
must
be
subordinated
to
legal
and
economical
ends
poetry
sculpture
painting
music
romance
history
comedy
tragedy
had
for
him
no
aim
save
exhortation
to
virtue
and
dissuasion
from
vice
sidenote
development
of
social
sympathy
is
the
whole
duty
of
art
in
the
estimation
of
guyau
who
became
famous
as
the
founder
of
social
æsthetic
and
was
according
to
certain
french
critics
inaugurator
of
the
third
epoch
in
the
history
of
æsthetic
the
first
being
the
æsthetic
of
the
ideal
plato
the
second
that
of
perception
kant
and
the
third
that
of
social
sympathy
guyau
in
his
of
contemporary
guyau
combats
the
theory
of
play
and
substitutes
that
of
life
in
a
posthumous
publication
in
its
sociological
he
explains
more
clearly
that
the
life
of
which
he
speaks
is
social
life
if
the
beautiful
be
the
intellectually
pleasing
certainly
it
can
not
be
identified
with
the
useful
which
is
only
searching
for
what
is
pleasing
but
the
useful
says
guyau
in
the
belief
that
he
is
correcting
both
kant
and
the
evolutionists
does
not
always
exclude
the
beautiful
of
which
indeed
it
often
forms
the
lowest
degree
the
study
of
art
is
embraced
partly
not
wholly
by
sociology
for
art
fulfils
two
ends
firstly
and
primarily
that
of
provoking
pleasant
sensations
of
colour
sound
etc
and
in
this
sense
finds
itself
in
the
presence
of
practically
incontestable
scientific
laws
which
connect
æsthetic
with
the
physics
optics
acoustics
etc
mathematics
physiology
and
psychophysics
sculpture
in
fact
rests
especially
on
anatomy
and
physiology
painting
on
anatomy
physiology
and
optics
architecture
on
optics
golden
section
etc
music
on
physiology
and
acoustics
poetry
on
metrics
whose
most
general
laws
are
acoustical
and
physiological
the
second
function
of
art
is
to
produce
the
phenomena
of
psychological
induction
which
bring
to
a
head
ideas
and
sentiments
of
most
complex
nature
sympathy
with
personages
represented
interest
pity
indignation
etc
in
short
all
the
social
feelings
which
constitute
it
the
expression
of
life
whence
are
derived
the
two
tendencies
recognised
in
art
one
inclining
towards
harmony
consonance
and
everything
delightful
to
ear
and
eye
the
other
towards
the
transfusion
of
life
into
the
domain
of
art
genius
true
genius
is
destined
to
preserve
the
balance
of
the
two
tendencies
decadents
and
degenerates
deprive
art
of
its
social
sympathetic
aim
by
setting
æsthetic
sympathy
at
war
against
human
sympathy
translating
all
this
into
familiar
terms
we
may
say
that
guy
au
asserts
one
purely
hedonistic
art
above
which
he
superimposes
another
art
also
hedonistic
but
serviceable
to
the
cause
of
morality
sidenote
the
same
polemic
against
decadents
degenerates
and
individualists
is
carried
on
by
another
writer
max
nordau
who
gives
art
the
task
of
the
wholeness
of
life
amongst
the
fragmentary
specialisation
characteristic
of
industrial
society
he
asserts
that
art
for
art
sake
art
as
the
simple
expression
of
internal
states
or
the
objectification
of
the
artist
feelings
no
doubt
exists
but
is
merely
the
art
of
quaternary
man
the
art
of
the
sidenote
naturalistic
is
the
best
term
with
which
to
qualify
the
æsthetic
derived
from
that
identification
of
genius
with
degeneracy
which
made
the
fortune
of
lombroso
and
his
school
this
identification
derives
its
chief
strength
from
the
following
piece
of
reasoning
great
mental
efforts
total
absorption
in
one
dominating
thought
often
bring
about
physiological
disorders
in
the
bodily
organism
and
weakness
or
atrophy
of
various
vital
functions
but
such
derangements
come
under
the
head
of
the
pathological
concept
of
illness
degeneration
madness
therefore
genius
is
identical
with
illness
degeneration
and
madness
a
syllogism
from
particular
to
general
in
which
case
according
to
traditional
logic
est
but
with
sociologists
such
as
nordau
lombroso
and
company
we
almost
overstep
the
line
separating
respectable
error
from
that
grosser
form
which
we
call
a
blunder
a
mere
confusion
between
scientific
analysis
and
historical
inquiry
or
description
is
visible
in
the
works
of
certain
sociologists
and
anthropologists
thus
one
of
them
carl
bücher
in
studying
the
life
of
primitive
peoples
asserts
that
poetry
music
and
work
were
originally
fused
in
one
single
act
that
poetry
and
music
were
used
to
regulate
the
rhythms
of
labour
this
may
be
historically
true
or
false
important
or
no
it
has
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
æsthetic
science
in
the
same
way
andrew
lang
maintains
that
the
doctrine
concerning
the
origin
of
art
as
disinterested
expression
of
the
mimetic
faculty
finds
no
confirmation
from
what
we
know
of
primitive
art
which
is
decorative
rather
than
expressive
as
though
primitive
art
which
is
a
mere
fact
awaiting
interpretation
could
ever
be
converted
into
a
criterion
for
the
interpretation
of
art
in
general
sidenote
of
the
same
vague
naturalism
exercised
a
baneful
influence
on
linguistic
which
of
late
years
has
been
wholly
lacking
in
such
profound
research
as
that
inaugurated
by
humboldt
and
followed
up
by
steinthal
but
steinthal
never
succeeded
in
founding
a
school
max
müller
popular
and
inaccurate
maintained
the
indivisibility
of
speech
and
thought
confounding
or
at
least
not
distinguishing
æsthetic
and
logical
thought
although
at
one
time
he
had
noted
that
the
formation
of
names
had
a
closer
connexion
with
wit
in
the
sense
of
locke
than
with
judgement
he
maintained
moreover
that
the
science
of
language
is
not
a
historical
but
a
natural
science
because
language
is
not
the
invention
of
man
the
dilemma
of
historical
and
natural
was
canvassed
and
resolved
over
and
over
again
with
little
result
another
philologist
whitney
attacked
the
miraculous
theory
of
müller
and
denied
that
thought
is
indivisible
from
speech
the
does
not
speak
but
he
can
think
he
observes
thought
is
not
function
of
the
acoustic
nerve
by
this
means
whitney
relapsed
into
the
ancient
doctrine
that
speech
is
a
symbol
or
means
of
expression
of
human
thought
subject
to
the
will
the
result
of
a
synthesis
of
faculties
and
of
a
capacity
for
intelligent
adaptation
of
means
to
end
sidenote
of
revival
philosophical
spirit
reappeared
in
paul
of
the
history
of
though
the
author
efforts
to
defend
himself
from
the
terrifying
accusation
of
being
a
philosopher
led
him
to
hunt
out
a
fresh
title
to
replace
the
scandalous
philosophy
of
language
but
if
paul
is
vague
about
the
relation
of
logic
to
grammar
he
must
be
given
every
credit
for
identifying
as
humboldt
had
already
done
the
question
of
the
origin
of
language
with
that
of
its
nature
and
reasserting
that
language
is
created
afresh
whenever
we
speak
he
must
also
be
given
credit
for
having
conclusively
criticized
the
ethnopsychology
of
steinthal
and
lazarus
showing
that
there
is
no
such
thing
as
collective
psyche
and
that
there
can
be
no
language
other
than
of
the
individual
sidenote
linguistic
of
wundt
on
the
other
hand
attached
the
study
of
language
mythology
and
customs
to
this
science
of
ethnopsychology
in
his
latest
work
on
this
very
subject
of
language
he
foolishly
echoes
whitney
gibes
and
denounces
as
a
miracle
theory
that
glorious
doctrine
inaugurated
by
herder
and
humboldt
whom
he
accuses
of
mystical
obscurity
he
observes
that
this
view
may
have
had
some
justification
before
the
principle
of
evolution
had
reached
its
triumphant
application
to
organic
nature
in
general
and
to
man
in
particular
he
has
not
the
faintest
notion
of
the
function
of
imagination
or
of
the
true
relation
between
thought
and
expression
he
finds
no
substantial
difference
between
expression
in
the
naturalistic
and
expression
in
the
spiritual
and
linguistic
sense
he
considers
language
as
a
special
highly
developed
form
of
the
vital
psychophysical
manifestations
and
of
the
expressive
movements
of
animals
out
of
these
facts
language
is
developed
by
imperceptible
gradations
so
that
beyond
the
general
concept
of
expressive
movement
there
is
no
specific
mark
by
which
language
can
be
distinguished
in
any
but
an
arbitrary
manner
the
philosophy
of
wundt
betrays
its
own
weakness
by
showing
its
inability
to
master
the
problem
of
language
and
art
in
his
æsthetic
facts
are
presented
as
a
complex
of
logical
and
ethical
elements
the
existence
of
æsthetic
as
a
special
normative
science
is
denied
not
for
the
good
and
sufficient
reason
that
there
are
no
such
things
as
normative
sciences
but
because
this
special
science
is
said
by
him
to
be
absorbed
by
the
two
sciences
of
logic
and
ethics
which
amounts
to
denying

kirchmann

up

a
similar
evolution
or
involution
of
the
idealists
into

of
psychologism
the
first
place
must
be
given
to
the
veteran
theodor
vischer
who
in
a
criticism
of
his
own
work
pronounced
æsthetic
to
be
the
union
of
mimics
and
harmonics
mimik
und
and
beauty
the
harmony
of
the
universe
never
actually
realized
because
realized
only
at
infinity
so
that
when
we
think
to
seize
it
in
the
beautiful
we
are
under
an
illusion
a
transcendent
illusion
which
is
the
very
essence
of
the
æsthetic
fact
his
son
robert
yischer
coined
the
word
to
express
the
life
with
which
man
endows
natural
objects
by
means
of
the
æsthetic
process
volkelt
when
treating
of
the
and
joining
symbolism
to
pantheism
opposed
associationism
and
favoured
a
natural
teleology
immanent
in
beauty
sidenote
the
herbartian
siebeck
abandoned
the
formalistic
theory
and
tried
to
explain
the
fact
of
beauty
by
the
concept
of
the
appearance
of
personality
he
distinguishes
between
objects
which
please
by
their
content
alone
sensuous
pleasures
those
which
please
by
form
alone
moral
facts
and
those
which
please
by
the
connexion
of
content
with
form
organic
and
æsthetic
facts
in
organic
facts
the
form
is
not
outside
the
content
but
is
the
expression
of
the
reciprocal
action
and
conjunction
of
the
constitutive
elements
whereas
in
æsthetic
facts
the
form
is
outside
the
content
and
as
it
were
its
mere
surface
not
a
means
to
the
end
but
an
end
in
itself
æsthetic
intuition
is
a
relation
between
the
sensible
and
the
spiritual
matter
and
spirit
and
is
thus
form
regarded
as
the
appearance
of
personality
æsthetic
pleasure
arises
from
the
spirit
consciousness
of
discovering
itself
in
the
sensible
siebeck
borrows
the
theory
of
modifications
of
the
beautiful
from
the
metaphysical
idealists
who
held
that
only
in
such
modifications
can
beauty
be
found
in
the
concrete
just
as
humanity
can
only
exist
as
a
man
of
determinate
race
and
nationality
the
sublime
is
that
species
of
beauty
wherein
the
formal
moment
of
circumscription
is
lost
and
is
therefore
the
unlimited
which
is
a
kind
of
extensive
or
intensive
infinity
the
tragic
arises
when
the
harmony
is
not
given
but
is
the
result
of
conflict
and
development
the
comic
is
a
relation
of
the
small
to
the
great
and
so
on
these
traces
of
idealism
together
with
his
firm
hold
on
the
kantian
and
herbartian
absoluteness
of
the
judgement
of
taste
make
it
impossible
to
regard
siebeck
æsthetic
as
purely
psychological
and
empirical
and
wholly
devoid
of
philosophical
elements
sidenote
it
is
the
same
with
diez
who
in
his
of
feeling
as
foundation
of
tries
to
explain
the
artistic
activity
as
a
return
to
the
ideal
of

parallel
with
science
ideal

ideal

but
whatever
is
this
feeling
is
it
the
empirical
feeling
of
the
psychologists
irreducible
to
an
ideal
or
the
mystic
faculty
of
communication
and
conjunction
with
the
infinite
and
the
absolute
the
absurd
of
fechner
or
the
judgement
of
kant
one
is
inclined
to
say
that
these
writers
and
others
like
them
still
under
the
influence
of
metaphysical
views
lack
the
courage
of
their
opinions
they
feel
themselves
to
be
in
an
atmosphere
of
hostility
and
speak
under
reservations
or
compromises
the
psychologist
jodi
asserts
the
existence
of
elementary
æsthetic
feelings
as
discovered
by
herbart
and
defines
them
as
immediate
excitations
not
resting
upon
associative
or
reproductive
activity
or
on
the
fancy
although
in
ultimate
analysis
they
must
be
reduced
to
the
same
principles
sidenote
tendency
teodor
the
purely
psychological
and
associationistic
tendency
becomes
clearly
defined
in
professor
teodor
lipps
and
his
school
lipps
criticizes
and
rejects
a
whole
series
of
æsthetic
theories
of
play
of
pleasure
of
art
as
recognition
of
real
life
even
if
displeasing
of
emotion
and
passional
excitation
syncretism
attributing
to
art
beside
the
primary

further

of
recognition
of
life
in
its
reality
revelation
of
individuality
commotion
freedom
from
a
weight
or
free
play
of
the
imagination
his
theory
differs
little
at
bottom
from
that
of
jouffroy
for
in
his
thesis
he
assumes
artistic
beauty
to
be
the
sympathetic
the
object
of
sympathy
is
our
objectified
ego
transposed
into
others
and
therefore
discovered
in
them
we
feel
ourselves
in
others
and
we
feel
others
in
ourselves
in
others
or
by
means
of
them
we
feel
ourselves
happy
free
enlarged
elevated
or
the
contrary
of
all
these
the
æsthetic
feeling
of
sympathy
is
not
a
mere
mode
of
æsthetic
enjoyment
it
is
that
enjoyment
itself
all
æsthetic
enjoyment
is
founded
in
the
last
analysis
singly
and
wholly
upon
sympathy
even
that
caused
by
geometrical
architectonic
tectonic
ceramic
lines
and
forms
whenever
in
a
work
of
art
we
find
a
personality
not
a
defect
of
the
man
but
something
positively
human
which
harmonizes
with
and
awakes
an
echo
in
the
possibilities
and
tendencies
of
our
own
life
and
vital
activities
whenever
we
find
positive
objective
humanity
pure
and
free
from
all
real
interests
lying
outside
the
work
of
art
as
art
only
can
reproduce
it
and
æsthetic
contemplation
alone
can
demand
the
harmony
the
resonance
fills
us
with
joy
the
value
of
personality
is
ethical
value
outside
it
there
is
no
possibility
or
determination
of
ethical
character
all
artistic
and
in
general
æsthetic
enjoyment
is
therefore
the
enjoyment
of
something
which
has
ethical
value
ethische
not
as
element
of
a
complex
but
as
object
of
æsthetic
intuition
the
æsthetic
fact
is
thus
deprived
of
all
its
own
value
and
allowed
merely
a
reflexion
from
the
value
of
morality
without
lingering
over
lipps
pupils
such
as
stern
and
others
and
writers
of
similar
tendency
such
as
biese
with
his
theory
of
anthropomorphism
and
universal
metaphor
or
konrad
lange
who
propounds
a
thesis
that
art
is
conscious
we
will
call
attention
to
professor
karl
groos
who
comes
within
measurable
distance
of
the
concept
of
æsthetic
activity
as
a
theoretic
value
between
the
two
poles
of
consciousness
sensibility
and
intellect
are
several
intermediate
grades
amongst
which
lies
intuition
or
fancy
whose
product
the
image
or
appearance
is
midway
between
sensation
and
concept
the
image
is
full
like
sensation
but
regulated
like
the
concept
it
has
neither
the
inexhaustible
richness
of
the
former
or
the
barren
nudity
of
the
latter
of
the
nature
of
image
or
appearance
is
the
æsthetic
fact
which
is
distinguished
from
the
simple
ordinary
image
not
by
its
quality
but
by
its
intensity
alone
the
æsthetic
image
is
merely
a
simple
image
occupying
the
summit
of
consciousness
representations
pass
through
consciousness
like
a
crowd
of
people
hurrying
over
a
bridge
each
bent
on
his
own
business
but
when
a
halts
on
the
bridge
and
looks
at
the
scene
then
is
it
holiday
then
arises
the
æsthetic
fact
this
is
therefore
not
passivity
but
activity
according
to
the
formula
adopted
by
groos
it
is
internal
imitation
it
may
be
objected
against
the
theory
that
every
image
so
far
as
it
is
an
image
at
all
must
occupy
the
summit
of
consciousness
if
only
for
an
instant
and
that
the
mere
image
is
either
the
product
of
an
activity
just
as
is
the
æsthetic
image
or
it
is
not
a
real
image
at
all
it
may
also
be
objected
that
the
definition
of
the
image
as
something
sharing
in
the
nature
of
sensation
and
concept
may
lead
back
to
intellectual
intuition
and
the
other
mysterious
faculties
of
the
metaphysical
school
for
which
groos
professes
abhorrence
his
division
of
the
æsthetic
fact
into
form
and
content
is
even
less
happy
he
recognizes
four
classes
of
content
associative
in
the
strict
sense
symbolic
typical
individual
and
into
his
inquiries
he
introduces
quite
unnecessarily
the
concepts
of
infusion
of
personality
and
of
play
in
connexion
with
the
latter
he
remarks
that
internal
imitation
is
the
noblest
game
of
man
and
adds
that
the
concept
of
play
applies
fully
to
contemplation
but
not
to
æsthetic
production
save
in
the
case
of
primitive
peoples
sidenote
modifications
of
the
beautiful
in
groos
and
groos
does
however
free
himself
from
the
modifications
of
beauty
because
æsthetic
activity
having
been
identified
with
internal
imitation
it
is
clear
that
whatever
is
not
internal
imitation
is
excluded
from
that
activity
as
something
different
all
beauty
beauty
understood
in
the
sense
of
belongs
to
the
æsthetic
activity
but
not
every
æsthetic
fact
is
beautiful
beauty
then
is
the
representation
of
the
sensuously
pleasant
ugliness
the
representation
of
the
unpleasant
the
sublime
that
of
a
mighty
thing
in
a
simple
form
the
comic
that
of
an
inferiority
which
arouses
in
us
a
pleasing
sense
of
our
own
superiority
and
so
forth
with
great
good
sense
groos
holds
up
to
derision
the
office
assigned
to
the
ugly
by
schasler
and
hartmann
with
their
superficial
dialectic
to
say
that
an
ellipse
contains
an
element
of
ugliness
in
comparison
with
the
circle
because
it
is
symmetrical
about
its
two
axes
only
and
not
about
infinite
diameters
is
like
saying
wine
has
a
relatively
unpleasant
taste
because
in
it
is
lacking
the
pleasant
taste
of
beer
lipps
too
in
his
writings
upon
æsthetic
recognizes
that
the
comic
of
which
he
gives
an
accurate
psychological
analysis
has
in
itself
no
æsthetic
value
but
his
moralistic
views
lead
him
to
outline
a
theory
of
it
not
unlike
that
of
the
overcoming
of
the
ugly
he
explains
it
as
a
process
leading
to
a
higher
æsthetic
value
sympathy
sidenote
viron
and
the
double
form
of
work
such
as
that
of
groos
and
occasionally
of
lipps
is
of
some
value
towards
the
elimination
of
errors
as
well
as
confining
æsthetic
research
to
the
field
of
internal
analysis
merit
of
the
same
kind
belongs
to
the
work
of
a
frenchman
véron
who
controverts
the
absolute
beauty
of
academical
æsthetic
and
after
accusing
taine
of
confounding
art
with
science
and
æsthetic
with
logic
remarks
that
if
it
be
the
duty
of
art
to
make
manifest
the
essence
of
things
their
one
dominating
quality
then
the
greatest
artists
would
be
those
who
have
best
succeeded
in
exhibiting
this
essence
and
the
greatest
works
would
resemble
each
other
more
closely
than
any
others
and
would
clearly
demonstrate
their
common
identity
whereas
the
exact
opposite
happens
but
one
looks
in
vain
for
scientific
method
in
véron
a
precursor
of
guyau
he
asserts
that
art
is
at
bottom
two
different
things
there
are
two
arts
one
decorative
whose
end
is
beauty
that
is
to
say
the
pleasure
of
eye
and
ear
resulting
from
determinate
dispositions
of
fines
forms
colours
sounds
rhythms
movements
fight
and
shade
without
necessary
interventions
of
ideas
and
feelings
and
capable
of
being
studied
by
optics
and
acoustics
the
other
expressive
which
gives
the
agitated
expression
of
human
personality
he
considers
that
decorative
art
prevails
in
the
ancient
world
and
expressive
art
in
the
modern
we
can
not
here
examine
in
detail
the
æsthetic
theories
of
artists
and
men
of
letters
the
scientific
and
historicist
prejudices
the
theory
of
experiment
and
human
document
which
underlie
the
realism
of
zola
or
the
moralism
which
underlies
the
of
ibsen
and
the
scandinavian
school
gustave
flaubert
wrote
of
art
profoundly
better
perhaps
than
any
other
frenchman
has
ever
written
not
in
special
treatises
but
throughout
his
letters
which
were
published
after
his
death
sidenote
under
the
influence
of
véron
and
his
hatred
for
the
concept
of
beauty
leo
tolstoy
wrote
his
book
on
art
which
according
to
the
great
russian
artist
communicates
feelings
in
the
same
way
in
which
words
communicate
thoughts
the
meaning
of
this
theory
is
made
clear
by
the
parallel
he
drew
between
art
and
science
and
his
conclusion
that
the
mission
of
art
is
to
render
sensible
and
capable
of
assimilation
that
which
could
not
be
assimilated
under
the
form
of
argumentation
and
that
true
science
examines
truths
considered
as
important
for
a
certain
society
at
a
given
epoch
and
fixes
them
in
the
consciousness
of
man
whereas
art
transports
them
from
the
domain
of
knowledge
to
that
of
feeling
there
is
therefore
no
such
thing
as
art
for
sake
any
more
than
science
for
science
sake
every
human
function
should
be
directed
to
increase
morality
and
to
suppress
violence
this
amounts
to
saying
that
nearly
all
art
from
the
beginning
of
the
world
is
false
aeschylus

amongst

rather
than
amongst
philosophers
must
be
reckoned
friedrich
nietzsche
whom
we
should
wrong
as
we
said
of
ruskin
by
trying
to
expound
his
æsthetic
doctrines
in
scientific
language
and
then
holding
them
up
to
the
facile
criticism
which
so
translated
they
would
draw
upon
themselves
in
none
of
his
books
not
even
in
his
first
birth
of
tragedy
in
spite
of
the
title
does
he
offer
us
a
real
theory
of
art
what
appears
to
be
theory
is
the
mere
expression
of
the
author
feelings
and
tendencies
he
shows
a
kind
of
anxiety
concerning
the
value
and
aim
of
art
and
the
problem
of
its
inferiority
or
superiority
to
science
and
philosophy
a
state
of
mind
characteristic
of
the
romantic
period
of
which
nietzsche
was
in
many
respects
a
belated
but
magnificent
representative
to
romanticism
as
well
as
to
schopenhauer
belong
the
elements
of
thought
which
issued
in
the
distinction
between
apollinesque
art
that
of
serene
contemplation
to
which
belong
the
epic
and
sculpture
and
dionysiac
art
the
art
of
agitation
and
tumult
such
as
music
and
the
drama
the
thought
is
vague
and
does
not
bear
criticism
but
it
is
supported
by
a
flight
of
inspiration
which
lifts
the
mind
to

spiritual
region

half
of

century
sidenote
æsthetician
of
music
the
most
notable
æsthetic
students
of
that
time
were
perhaps
a
group
of
persons
engaged
in
constructing
theories
of
particular
arts
and
since
as
we
have
seen
philosophical
laws
or
theories
of
individual
arts
are
inconceivable
it
was
inevitable
that
the
ideas
presented
by
such
thinkers
should
be
as
indeed
they
are
nothing
more
than
general
æsthetic
conclusions
first
may
be
mentioned

acute
bohemian
critic
eduard
hanslick
who
published
his
work

in
it
was
often
reprinted
and
was
translated
into
various

hanslick
waged
war
against
richard
wagner
and
in
general
against
the
pretension
of
finding
concepts
feelings
and
other
definite
contents
in
music
in
the
most
insignificant
musical
works
where
the
most
powerful
microscope
can
discover
nothing

are
now
asked
to
recognize
a

some
such
absurdity
should
the
cover
have
the
audacity
to
affirm
that
this
is
the
subject
of
the
piece
with
equal
vivacity
he
protests
against
the
sentimental
hearers
who
instead
of
enjoying
the
work
of
art
set
themselves
to
extract
pathological
effects
of
passionate
excitement
and
practical
activity
if
it
be
true
that
greek
music
produced
effects
of
this
kind
if
it
needed
but
a
few
phrygian
strains
to
animate
troops
with
courage
in
the
face
of
the
enemy
or
a
melody
in
the
dorian
mode
to
ensure
the
fidelity
of
a
wife
whose
husband
was
far
away
then
the
loss
of
greek
music
is
a
melancholy
thing
for
generals
and
husbands
but
æstheticians
and
composers
need
not
regret
it
if
every
senseless
every
noisy
funeral
march
every
wailing
had
the
power
of
depressing
us
who
could
put
up
with
existence
under
such
conditions
but
let
a
real
musical
work
confront
us
and
glowing
with
beauty
and
we
feel
ourselves
enslaved
by
its
invincible
fascination
even
if
its
material
is
all
the
sorrows
of
the
age
sidenote
concept
of
hanslick
maintained
that
the
sole
aim
of
music
is
form
musical
beauty
this
affirmation
won
him
the
goodwill
of
the
herbartians
who
hastened
to
welcome
such
a
vigorous
and
unexpected
ally
by
way
of
returning
the
compliment
hanslick
felt
obliged
in
later
editions
of
his
work
to
mention
herbart
himself
and
his
faithful
disciple
robert
zimmermann
who
had
given
so
he
said
full
development
to
the
great
æsthetic
principle
of
form
the
praises
of
the
herbartians
and
the
courteous
declarations
of
hanslick
both
arose
from
a
misunderstanding
for
the
words
beauty
and
form
have
one
meaning
for
the
former
and
quite
another
for
the
latter
hanslick
never
thought
that
symmetry
purely
acoustical
relations
and
pleasures
of
the
ear
constituted
musical
beauty
mathematics
he
held
are
utterly
useless
to
musical
æsthetic
musical
beauty
is
spiritual
and
significative
it
has
thoughts
undoubtedly
but
those
thoughts
are
musical
sonorous
forms
are
not
empty
but
perfectly
filled
they
can
not
be
compared
with
simple
lines
delimiting
a
space
they
are
the
spirit
assuming
body
and
extracting
from
itself
the
stuff
of
its
own
incarnation
rather
than
an
arabesque
music
is
a
picture
but
a
picture
whose
subject
can
neither
be
expressed
in
words
nor
enclosed
in
precise
concept
there
are
in
music
both
meaning
and
connexion
but
these
are
of
a
specifically
musical
nature
music
is
a
language
we
understand
and
speak
but
which
it
is
not
possible
to
translate
hanslick
asserts
that
though
music
does
not
portray
the
quality
of
feelings
it
does
portray
their
dynamic
aspect
or
tone
if
not
the
substantives
then
the
adjectives
it
depicts
not
murmuring
tenderness
or
impetuous
courage
but
the
murmuring
and
the
impetuous
the
backbone
of
the
book
is
the
denial
that
form
and
content
can
ever
be
separated
in
music
in
music
there
can
be
no
content
in
opposition
to
the
form
since
there
can
be
no
form
outside
the
content
take
a
motive
the
first
that
comes
into
your
head
what
is
its
content
what
its
form
where
does
this
begin
and
that
end
what
do
you
wish
to
call
content
the
sounds
very
well
but
they
have
already
received
a
form
what
will
you
call
form
also
the
sounds
but
they
are
form
already
filled
form
supplied
with
content
such
observations
denote
acute
penetration
of
the
nature
of
art
though
not
scientifically
formulated
or
framed
into
a
system
hanslick
thought
he
was
dealing
with
peculiarities
of
music
instead
of
with
the
universal
and
constitutive
character
of
every
form
of
art
and
this
prevented
him
from
taking
larger
views
sidenote
of
the
figurative
arts
another
specialist
æsthetician
is
conrad
fiedler
author
of
many
essays
on
the
figurative
arts
the
most
important
being
his
of
artistic
no
one
perhaps
has
better
or
more
eloquently
emphasized
the
activistic
character
of
art
which
he
compares
with
language
art
begins
exactly
where
intuition
perception
ends
the
artist
is
not
differentiated
from
other
people
by
any
special
perceptive
attitude
enabling
him
to
perceive
more
or
with
greater
intensity
or
endowing
his
eye
with
any
special
power
of
selecting
collecting
transforming
ennobling
or
illuminating
but
rather
by
his
peculiar
gift
of
being
able
to
pass
immediately
from
perception
to
intuitive
expression
his
relation
with
nature
is
not
perceptive
but
expressive
a
man
standing
passively
at
gaze
may
well
imagine
himself
in
possession
of
the
visible
world
as
an
immense
rich
varied
whole
the
entire
absence
of
fatigue
with
which
he
traverses
the
infinite
mass
of
visual
impressions
the
rapidity
with
which
representations
dart
across
his
consciousness
convince
him
that
he
stands
in
the
midst
of
an
immense
visible
world
although
he
may
quite
well
be
unable
at
any
one
instant
to
represent
it
to
himself
as
a
whole
but
this
world
so
great
so
rich
so
immeasurable
disappears
the
moment
art
seeks
to
become
its
master
the
very
first
effort
to
emerge
from
this
twilight
and
arrive
at
clear
vision
restricts
the
circle
of
things
to
be
seen
artistic
activity
may
be
conceived
as
continuation
of
that
concentration
by
which
consciousness
makes
the
first
step
towards
clear
vision
which
it
reaches
only
by
spiritual
process
and
bodily
process
are
here
an
indivisible
whole
which
is
expression
sidenote
and
this
activity
simply
because
it
is
spiritual
must
consist
of
forms
wholly
determinate
tangible
sensibly
demonstrative
art
is
not
in
a
state
of
subjection
to
science
like
the
man
of
science
the
artist
desires
to
escape
from
the
natural
perceptive
state
and
to
make
the
world
his
own
but
there
are
regions
to
which
we
can
penetrate
not
by
the
forms
of
thought
and
science
but
only
through
art
art
is
strictly
speaking
not
imitation
of
nature
for
what
is
nature
save
this
confused
mass
of
perceptions
and
representations
whose
real
poverty
has
been
demonstrated
already
in
another
sense
however
art
may
be
called
imitation
of
nature
inasmuch
as
its
aim
is
not
to
expound
concepts
or
to
arouse
emotions
that
is
to
create
values
of
intellect
and
feeling
art
does
create
both
these
values
if
you
like
to
say
so
but
only
in
one
quite
peculiar
quality
which
consists
in
complete
visibility
here
we
have
the
same
sane
conception
the
same
lively
comprehension
of
the
true
nature
of
art
which
we
found
in
hanslick
only
expressed
in
a
more
rigorous
and
philosophical
manner
with
fiedler
is
connected
his
friend
adolf
hildebrand
who
brought
into
high
relief
the
activistic
or
architectonic
as
opposed
to
imitative
character
of
art
illustrating
his
theoretical
discussions
especially
from
sculpture
the
art
which
he
himself
followed
sidenote
limits
of
these
what
we
chiefly
miss
in
fiedler
and
others
of
the
same
tendency
is
the
conception
of
the
æsthetic
fact
not
as
something
exceptional
produced
by
exceptionally
gifted
men
but
as
a
ceaseless
activity
of
man
as
such
for
man
possesses
the
world
so
far
as
he
does
possess
it
only
in
the
form
of
and
only
knows
in
so
far
as
he
creates
nor
are
these
writers
justified
in
treating
language
as
parallel
with
art
or
art
with
language
for
comparisons
are
drawn
between
things
at
least
partially
different
whereas
art
and
language
are
identical
sidenote
the
same
criticism
can
be
made
in
the
case
of
the
french
philosopher
bergson
who
in
his
book
on
states
a
theory
of
art
very
similar
to
that
of
fiedler
and
makes
the
same
mistake
of
conceiving
the
artistic
faculty
as
something
distinct
and
exceptional
in
comparison
with
the
language
of
everyday
use
in
ordinary
life
says
bergson
the
individuality
of
things
escapes
us
we
see
only
as
much
of
them
as
our
practical
needs
demand
language
helps
this
simplification
since
all
names
proper
names
excepted
are
names
of
kinds
or
classes
now
and
then
however
nature
as
if
in
a
fit
of
absence
of
mind
creates
souls
of
a
more
divisible
and
detached
kind
artists
who
discover
and
reveal
the
riches
hidden
under
the
colourless
signs
and
labels
of
everyday
life
and
help
others
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
what
they
themselves
see
employing
for
this
purpose
colours
forms
rhythmic
connexions
of
words
and
those
rhythms
of
life
and
breath
even
more
intimate
to
man
the
sounds
and
notes
of
music
sidenote
to
return
to
baumgarten
a
healthy
return
to
baumgarten
a
revival
and
correction
of
the
old
philosopher
theories
in
the
light
of
later
discoveries
might
perhaps
have
given
æsthetic
some
assistance
after
the
collapse
of
the
old
idealistic
metaphysic
towards
thinking
the
concept
of
art
in
its
universality
and
discovering
its
identity
with
pure
and
true
intuitive
knowledge
but
conrad
hermann
who
preached
the
return
to
baumgarten
in
did
bad
service
to
what
might
have
been
a
good
cause
according
to
him
æsthetic
and
logic
are
normative
sciences
but
logic
does
not
contain
as
does
æsthetic
a
definite
category
of
external
objects
exclusively
and
specifically
adequate
to
the
faculty
of
thought
and
on
the
other
hand
the
products
and
results
of
scientific
thought
are
not
so
external
and
sensibly
intuitive
as
those
of
artistic
invention
logic
and
æsthetic
alike
refer
not
to
the
empirical
thinking
and
feeling
of
the
soul
but
to
pure
and
absolute
sensation
and
thought
art
constructs
a
representation
standing
midway
between
the
individual
and
the
universal
beauty
expresses
specific
perfection
the
essential
or
so
to
speak
the
rightful
character
of
things
form
is
the
external
sensible
limit
or
mode
of
appearance
of
a
thing
in
opposition
to
the
kernel
of
the
thing
itself
and
to
its
essential
and
substantial
content
content
and
form
are
both
æsthetic
and
the
æsthetic
interest
concerns
the
entirety
of
the
beautiful
object
the
artistic
activity
has
no
special
organ
such
as
thought
possesses
in
speech
the
æsthetician
like
the
lexicographer
has
the
task
of
compiling
a
dictionary
of
tones
and
colours
and
of
the
different
meanings
which
may
possibly
be
attached
to
them
we
can
see
that
hermann
accepted
side
by
side
the
most
inconsistent
propositions
he
welcomes
even
the
æsthetic
law
of
the
golden
section
and
applies
it
to
tragedy
the
longer
segment
of
the
une
is
the
tragic
hero
the
punishment
which
overtakes
him
the
entire
line
exceeds
his
crime
in
the
same
proportion
in
which
he
oversteps
the
common
measure
the
shorter
segment
of
the
line
it
reads
almost
like
a
joke
without
direct
reference
to
baumgarten
a
proposal
that
æsthetic
be
reformed
and
treated
as
the
science
of
intuitive
knowledge
was
made
in
a
miserable
little
work
by
one
willy
nef
who
makes
the
dumb
animals
share
his
intuitive
knowledge
in
which
he
distinguishes
a
formal
side
intuition
and
a
material
side
or
content
knowledge
and
considers
the
everyday
relations
between
men
their
games
and
their
art
as
belonging
to
intuitive
knowledge
sidenote
the
english
historian
of
æsthetic
bosanquet
tried
to
find
a
reconciliation
between
content
and
form
in
unity
of
expression
beauty
says
bosanquet
in
the
introduction
to
his
is
that
which
has
characteristic
and
individual
expressiveness
for
sensuous
perception
or
imagination
subject
to
the
conditions
of
general
or
abstract
expressiveness
by
the
same
means
in
another
passage
he
observes
the
difficulty
of
real
æsthetic
is
to
show
how
the
combination
of
decorative
forms
in
characteristic
representations
by
intensifying
the
essential
character
immanent
in
them
from
the
beginning
subordinates
them
to
a
central
signification
which
stands
to
their
complex
combination
as
their
abstract
signification
stands
to
each
one
of
them
taken
singly
but
the
problem
as
propounded
in
a
way
suggested
by
the
antithesis
between
the
two
schools
contentism
and
formalism
of
german

quickly
misunderstood

by
those
who
presumed
to
correct
it
and
in
fact
only
returned
to
the
outworn
rhetorical
conception
of
art
as
consisting
of
a
little
content
and
a
little
form
only
within
the
last
ten
years
has
there
been
a
renewal
of
philosophical
studies
arising
out
of
discussions
concerning
the
nature
of
history
and
the
relation
in
which
it
stands
to
art
and
science
and
nourished
by
the
controversy
excited
by
the
publication
of
de

posthumous
works
the
same
problem
of
the
relation
between
history
and

also

and
the
revival
of

sidenote
of
the
history
of
we
have
reached
the

of
our
history
having
passed
in
review
the
travail

through
which
the

of
the
æsthetic
concept
was
achieved
the
vicissitudes

of

may
now
conclude
without
appearing
to
assert
anything
unproven
that
of
æsthetic
in
the
proper
sense
of
the
word
we
have
seen
very
little
even
including
the
last
two
centuries
active
research
exceptional
intellects
have
hit
the
mark
and
have
supported
their
views
with
energy
with
logic
and
with
consciousness
of
what
they
were
doing
it
would
no
doubt
be
possible
to
extract
many
true
affirmations
leading
to
the
same
point
of
view
from
the
works
of
writers
and
artists
from
commonly
received
opinions
and
proverbial
sayings
such
a
collection
would
show
that
this
handful
of
philosophers
does
not
stand
alone
but
is
surrounded
by
a
throng
of
supporters
and
is
in
perfect
agreement
with
the
general
mind
and
universal
common
sense
but
if
schiller
was
right
in
saying
that
the
rhythm
of
philosophy
is
to
diverge
from
common
opinion
in
order
to
return
with
redoubled
vigour
it
is
evident
that
such
divergence
is
necessary
and
constitutes

this
tedious
process
æsthetic

which
were
at

deviations
from
the

attempts
to
reach
it

were

antiquity

half
of

in

erroneous

ploughing
the

in

this
series
of
thinkers
suffices
to
remind
us
that
æsthetic
science
no
longer
remains
to
be
discovered
but
at
the
same
time
the
fact
that
they
are
so
few
and
so
often
despised
ignored
or
controverted
proves
that
it
is
in
its
infancy
sidenote
of

of
the

the

consists
like

and

general
and

which
lurk
in
its
path
on
every
side
the
forms

are

in

with
the

in

equally
numerous
root
out

another

in
its

the

also
reappear
though
never
in
the

shape
hence
the
necessity
for
perpetual
scientific
criticism
and
the
impossibility
of
repose
or
finality
in
a
science
and
of
an
end
to
further
discussion
the
errors
which
may
be
described
as
general
negations
of
the
concept
of
art
itself
have
been
touched
on
from
time
to
time
in
the
course
of
this
history
whence
it
may
be
gathered
a
simple
affirmation
of
the
truth
has
not
always
been
accompanied
by
any
considerable
recapture
of
enemy
territory
as
to
what
we
have
called
particular
errors
it
is
clear
that
when
freed
from
confusing
admixture
of
other
forms
and
divested
of
fanciful
expression
they
reduce
themselves
to
three
heads
under
which
they
have
already
been
criticized
in
the
first
or
theoretical
part
of
this
work
that
is
to
say
errors
may
be
directed
against
the
characteristic
quality
of
the
æsthetic
fact
against
the
specific
against
the
generic
they
may
involve
denial
of
the
character
of
intuition
of
theoretic
contemplation
or
of
spiritual
activity
which
together
constitute
the
æsthetic
fact
among
the
errors
which
fall
into
these
three
categories
we
are
now
to
sketch
in
outline
the
history
of
those
which
have
had
or
have
the
greatest
importance
rather
than
a
history
it
will
be
a
historical
essay
sufficient
to
show
that
even
in
the
criticism
of
individual
errors
æsthetic
science
is
in
its
infancy
if
among
these
errors
some
appear
to
be
decadent
and
nearly
forgotten
they
are
not
dead
they
have
not
accomplished
a
legal
demise
at
the
hands
of
scientific
criticism
oblivion
or
instinctive
rejection
is
not
the
same
thing
as
scientific
denial
i
rhetoric
or
the
theory
of
ornate
form
sidenote
in
the
ancient
proceeding
according
to
rank
in
importance
we
inevitably
head
the
list
of
theories
for
examination
with
the
theory
of
rhetoric
or
ornate
form
it
will
not
be
superfluous
to
observe
that
the
meaning
given
in
modern
times
to
the
word
rhetoric
namely
the
doctrine
of
ornate
form
differs
from
that
which
it
had
for
the
ancients
rhetoric
in
the
modern
sense
is
above
all
a
theory
of
elocution
while
elocution
λέξις
φράσις
ἑρμηνεία
elocutio
was
but
one
portion
and
not
the
principal
one
of
ancient
rhetoric
taken
as
a
whole
it
consisted
strictly
of
a
manual
or
for
advocates
and
politicians
it
concerned
itself
with
the
two
or
the
three
styles
judicial
deliberative
demonstrative
and
gave
advice
or
furnished
models
to
those
striving
to
produce
certain
effects
by
means
of
speech
no
definition
of
the
art
is
more
accurate
than
that
given
by
its
inventors
the
earliest
sicilian
rhetoricians
scholars
of
empedocles
corax
tisias
gorgias
rhetoric
is
the
creator
of
persuasion
πειθος
δημιουργός
it
devoted
itself
to
showing
the
method
of
using
language
so
as
to
create
a
certain
belief
a
certain
state
of
mind
in
the
hearer
hence
the
phrase
making
the
weaker
case
stronger
τὸ
τὸν
ἥττω
λόgον
κρείττω
ποιεῖν
the
increase
or
diminution
according
to
circumstances
in
augendo
minuendoque
the
advice
of
gorgias
to
turn
a
thing
to
a
jest
if
the
adversary
takes
it
seriously
or
to
a
serious
matter
if
he
takes
it
as
a
jest
and
many
similar
maxims
sidenote
from
moral
point
of
he
who
acts
in
this
manner
is
not
only
æsthetically
accomplished
as
saying
beautifully
that
which
he
wishes
to
say
he
is
also
and
especially
a
practical
man
with
a
practical
end
in
view
as
a
practical
man
however
he
can
not
evade
moral
responsibility
for
his
actions
this
point
was
fastened
upon
by
plato
polemic
against
rhetoric
that
is
to
say
against
fluent
political
charlatans
and
unscrupulous
lawyers
and
journalists
plato
was
quite
right
to
condemn
rhetoric
when
dissociated
from
a
good
purpose
as
blameworthy
and
discreditable
directed
to
arouse
the
passions
a
diet
ruinous
to
health
a
paint
disastrous
to
beauty
even
had
rhetoric
allied
herself
to
ethics
becoming
a
true
guide
of
the
soul
ψυχαγωγία
τις
διὰ
τῶν
λόγον
had
plato
criticism
been
directed
solely
against
her
abusers
everything
being
liable
to
abuse
save
virtue
itself
says
aristotle
had
rhetoric
been
purified
producing
such
an
orator
as
cicero
desired
ex
rhetorum
officinis
sed
ex
academiae
and
imposing
on
him
with
quintilian
the
duty
of
being
bonus
dicendi
yet
the
unalterable
fact
remains
that
rhetoric
can
never
be
considered
a
regular
science
being
formed
of
a
congeries
of
widely
dissimilar
cognitions
sidenote
without
it
included
descriptions
of
passions
and
affections
comparisons
of
political
and
judicial
institutions
theories
of
the
abbreviated
syllogism
or
enthymeme
and
of
proof
leading
to
a
probable
conclusion
pedagogic
and
popular

literary
elocution

and
mimicry

and
so
forth
sidenote
fortunes
in
the
middle
ages
and
the
rich
and
heterogeneous
content
of
this
ancient
rhetoric
which
reached
its
highest
development
in
the
hands
of
hermagoras
of
temnos
in
the
second
century
gradually
diminished
in
volume
with
the
decadence
of
the
ancient
world
and
the
change
in
political
conditions
this
is
not
the
place
to
dwell
on
its
fortunes
in
the
middle
ages
or
its
partial
replacement
by
formularies
and
and
later
by
treatises
upon
the
art
of
preaching
or
to
quote
the
reasons
given
by
such
writers
as
patrizzi
and
tassoni
for
its
disappearance
from
the
world
of
their
day
such
history
would
be
well
worth
writing
but
would
be
out
of
place
here
we
will
merely
state
that
whilst
conditions
were
at
work
on
every
side
corroding
this
complex
of
cognitions
louis
vives
peter
ramus
and
patrizzi
himself
were
busy
criticizing
it
from
the
point
of
view
of
systematic
science
sidenote
by
vives
ramus
and
vives
emphasized
the
confused
methods
of
the
ancient
who
embraced
united
eloquence
with
morality
and
insisted
that
the
orator
must
be
he
rejected
of
ancient
rhetoric
as
extraneous
namely
memory
which
is
necessary
in
all
arts
invention
which
is
the
matter
of
each
individual
art
recitation
which
is
external
and
disposition
which
belongs
to
invention
he
retained
elocution
only
not
that
which
treats
of
dicendum
but
of
ad
modum
extending
it
beyond
the
three
styles
or
kinds
to
include
history
apologue
epistles
novels
and
poetry
antiquity
furnishes
us
with
few
and
faint
attempts
at
such
extension
now
and
then
a
rhetorician
ventures
to
suggest
that
the
γένος
ίστορικόν
and
ἐπιστολικόν
be
included
in
rhetoric
and
even
in
spite
of
opposition
infinite
questions
that
is
to
say
merely
theoretical
questions
with
no
practical
application
which
amounts
to
a
scientific
or
philosophical
genus
others
agreed
with
cicero
that
when
one
had
mastered
the
most
difficult
of
all
arts
forensic
eloquence
all
else
seemed
est
homini
non
ramus
and
his
pupil
omer
talon
reproached
aristotle
cicero
and
quintilian
with
having
confused
dialectic
and
rhetoric
and
they
assigned
invention
and
disposition
to
the
former
agreeing
with
vives
that
elocution
alone
should
be
allowed
to
rhetoric
patrizzi
on
the
other
hand
refused
the
name
of
science
to
either
recognizing
them
as
simple
faculties
containing
no
individual
matter
not
even
the
three
genera
and
differentiating
them
only
by
attaching
the
term
dialectic
to
the
dialogue
form
and
proof
of
the
necessary
and
rhetoric
to
connected
discourse
directed
to
persuasion
in
matters
of
opinion
patrizzi
observes
that
conjoined
speech
is
used
by
historians
poets
and
philosophers
no
less
than
by
orators
and
thus
approaches
the
view
of
vives
sidenote
into
modern
in
spite
of
these
opinions
the
body
of
rhetorical
doctrine
continued
to
flourish
in
the
schools
patrizzi
was
forgotten
if
ramus
and
vives
had
some
followers
such
as
francisco
sanchez
and
keckermann
they
were
generally
held
up
to
odium
by
the
traditionalists
in
the
end
rhetoric
found
a
supporter
in
philosophy
when
campanella
made
the
following
declaration
in
his
magiae
portiuncula
quae
affectus

by

a
little
book
entitled

by
him
to
be
a
psychological
introduction
to
æsthetic
doctrine
on
the
other
hand
immanuel
kant
in
his

observes
that
eloquence
in
the
sense
of
or
art
of
persuasion
by
means
of
beautiful
appearance
and
dialectical
form
must
be
distinguished
from
beautiful
speaking
and
that
the
art
of
oratory
playing
upon
the
weakness
of
men
to
gain
its
own
ends
is
worthy
of
no
esteem

but
in
the
schools
it
flourished
in
many
celebrated
compilations
including
one
by
the
french
jesuit
father
dominique
de
colonne
which
was
in
use
until
some
few
decades
ago
even
in
literary
institutions
we
come
across
survivals
of
ancient
rhetoric
notably
in
chapters
devoted
to
the
art
of
oratory
and
fresh
manuals
on
judicial
or
sacred
eloquence
ortloff

are
actually
appearing
though
rarely
still
rhetoric
in
the
ancient
sense
may
be
said
to
have
disappeared
from
the
system
of
the
sciences
no
philosopher
would
dream
of
following
campanella
in
dedicating
a
special
section
of
rational
philosophy
to
rhetoric
sidenote
signification
of

theory
of
literary
in
compensation
for
this
process
the
theory
of
elocution
and
beautiful
speech
has
been
in
modern
times
progressively
emphasized
and
thrown
into
scientific
form
but
the
idea
of
such
a
science
is
ancient
as
we
have
seen
and
equally
ancient
is
the
style
of
exposition
consisting
in
the
doctrine
of
a
double
form
and
the
concept
of
ornate
form
sidenote
of
the
concept
of
ornament
must
have
occurred
spontaneously
to
the
mind
as
soon
as
attention
was
directed
to
the
values
of
speech
by
listening
to
poets
reciting
or
to
oratorical
contests
in
public
gatherings
it
must
very
early
have
been
thought
that
the
difference
between
good
speaking
and
bad
or
between
that
which
gave
more
pleasure
and
that
which
gave
less
between
grave
or
solemn
and
commonplace
or
colloquial
consisted
in
something
additional
superimposed
upon
the
canvas
of
ordinary
speech
like
an
embroidery
by
a
skilful
orator
these
considerations
led
the
rhetoricians
to
adopt
the
practice
like
the
indians
who
arrived
at
the
distinction
independently
to
distinguish
the
bare
ψιλή
or
purely
grammatical
form
from
another
form
containing
an
addition
which
they
called
ornament
κόσμος
quintilian
will
serve
as
typical
of
all
the
rest
quod
perspicuo
ac
probabili
plus
est
the
notion
of
ornament
as
something
added
on
from
outside
forms
the
basis
of
the
theory
which
aristotle
the
philosopher
of
rhetoric
gave
of
the
queen
of
ornaments
metaphor
according
to
him
the
high
pleasure
aroused
by
metaphor
arises
from
the
collocation
of
different
terms
and
the
discovery
of
relations
between
species
and
genera
producing
learning
and
knowledge
by
means
of
the
genus
μαθησιν
καi
γνῶσιν
διὰ
τοῦ
γένους
and
that
easy
learning
which
is
the
greatest
of
human
pleasures
which
amounts
to
saying
that
metaphor
adds
to
the
concept
under
consideration
a
group
of
minor
incidental
cognitions
as
a
kind
of
diversion
and
relief
and
pleasant
instruction
for
the
mind
sidenote
of
ornaments
were
divided
and
subdivided
in
a
number
of
different
ways
aristotle
and
previously
isocrates
rather
differently
classified
the
ornaments
which
diversify
bare
or
nude
form
under
the
heads
of
dialect
forms
substitutions
and
epithets
prolongations
truncations
and
abbreviations
of
words
and
other
departures
from
common
usage
and
finally
rhythm
and
harmony
substitutions
were
of
four
classes
species
for
genus
genus
for
species
species
for
species
and
proportionate
after
aristotle
elocution
was
especially
studied
by
theophrastus
and
demetrius
phalereus
these
rhetoricians
and
their
followers
further
solidified
the
classification
of
ornament
by
distinguishing
tropes
from
figures
σχήματα
and
dividing
figures
into
figures
of
speech
scheimata
τῆς
λέχεως
and
of
thought
τῆς
διανοίας
figures
of
speech
into
grammatical
and
rhetorical
and
figures
of
thought
into
pathetic
and
ethic
substitutions
were
divided
into
fourteen
principal
forms
metaphor
synecdoche
metonymy
antonomasia
onomatopeia
catachresis
metalepsis
epithet
allegory
enigma
irony
periphrase
hyperbaton
and
hyperbole
each
divided
into
subspecies
and
contrasted
with
its
relative
vice
figures
of
speech
amounted
to
a
score
or
so
repetition
anaphora
antistrophe
climax
asyndeton
assonance
etc
figures
of
thought
to
about
the
same
number
interrogation
prosopopœia
ætiopœia
hypotyposis
commotion
simulation
exclamation
apostrophe
aposiopesis
if
these
divisions
have
any
value
as
aids
to
memory
in
relation
to
particular
literary
forms
considered
rationally
they
are
simply
capricious
as
is
evidenced
by
the
fact
that
many
classes
of
the
ornate
appear
now
under
the
heading
of
tropes
now
of
figures
sometimes
under
figures
of
speech
then
as
those
of
thought
no
reason
for
the
alteration
is
given
except
the
arbitrary
caprice
of
an
individual
rhetorician
which
so
decrees
and
disposes
and
since
one
function
which
may
be
fulfilled
by
the
rhetorical
categories
is
to
point
out
the
divergence
between
two
ways
of
expressing
the
same
thing
one
of
which
is
arbitrarily
selected
as
proper
it
is
easy
to
see
why
the
ancients
defined
metaphor
as
vel
sermonis
a
propria
significatione
in
aliam
cum
virtute
mutatio
and
figure
as
quaedam
orationis
remota
a
communi
et
primum
se
offerenti
sidenote
concept
of
the
so
far
as
we
know
antiquity
raised
no
revolt
against
the
theory
of
ornament
or
of
double
form
we
do
sometimes
hear
cicero
quintilian
seneca
and
others
saying
res
verba
rapiunt
pectus
est
quod
disertos
facit
et
vis
mentis
rem
tene
verba
sequentur
curam
verborum
rerum
volo
esse
sollicitudinem
or
est
verborum
nisi
rei
cohaerentium
but
these
maxims
did
not
bear
the
weighty
meanings
which
we
moderns
might
attach
to
them
they
were
perhaps
in
contradiction
with
the
theory
of
ornament
but
as
the
contradiction
was
unheeded
it
was
ineffective
they
were
the
protests
of
common
sense
powerless
to
combat
the
fallacies
of
school
doctrine
moreover
the
latter
was
fitted
with
a
a
sage
contrivance
to
disguise
its
inherent
absurdity
if
the
ornate
consisted
of
a
in
what
degree
should
it
be
used
if
it
gave
pleasure
must
we
not
conclude
that
the
more
it
were
used
the
greater
the
pleasure
derived
would
its
extravagant
use
be
attended
by
extravagant
pleasure
herein
was
peril
instinctively
the
rhetoricians
hastened
to
the
defence
snatching
up
the
first
weapon
that
came
to
hand
namely
the
fitting

be
used

the
fitting
was
a
concept
quite
inconsistent
with
that
of
ornament
it
was
a
rival
and
enemy
destined
to
destroy
it
fitting
to
what
to
expression
of
course
but
that
which
is
fitting
to
expression
can
not
be
called
an
ornament
an
external
addition
it
coincides
with
expression
itself
but
the
rhetoricians
contented
themselves
with
maintaining
peaceful
relations
between
the
ornate
and
the
fitting
without
troubling
to
mediate
them
through
a
third
concept
the
alone
in
answer
to
an
observation
of
his
predecessor
cæcilius
that
more
than
two
or
three
metaphors
must
not
be
used

theory
of

in

and

such
as
the

marcianus

and
in

and

the
theory
of
ornament
passed
to
the
middle
ages
throughout
this
period
rhetoric
grammar
and
logic
continued
to
form
the
of
the
schools
the
theory
was
to
some
extent
favoured
in
mediæval
times
by
the
fact
that
writers
and
scholars
made
use
of
a
dead
language
this
helped
to
reinforce
the
idea
that
beautiful
form
was
not
a
spontaneous
thing
but
consisted
in
an
addition
or
embroidery
under
the
renaissance
the
theory
continued
to
flourish
and
was
revived
by
study
of
the
best
classical
sources
to
the
works
of
cicero
were
added
the
of
quintilian
and
the
of
aristotle

host
of
minor
latin
and
greek
rhetoricians
amongst
whom
was
hermogenes

celebrated

into

camillo

dared
to

lamented
over
the
exaggerated
subtlety
of
the
greeks
which
had
multiplied
distinctions
to

in
this
matter
without
diffusing
light
but
he
never
took
up
a
definite
stand
against
the
theory
of
ornament
patrizzi
was
dissatisfied
with
the
insufficient
definition
of
ornament
given
by
the
ancients
but
he
asserted
the
existence
of
ornaments
and
metaphors
as
well
as
seven
different
modes
of
conjoined
speech
narrative
proof
amplification
diminution
ornament
with
its
contrary
elevation
and
depression
the
school
of
ramus
continued
to
entrust
rhetoric
with
the
embellishment
of
thought
owing
to
the
vast
extension
and
intensification
of
life
and
literature
in
the
sixteenth
century
it
would
be
easy
to
quote
phrases
as
we
have
done
from
ancient
authors
asserting
the
strict
dependence
of
speech
upon
the
things
it
wishes
to
express
and
lively
attacks
on
pedants
and
pedantic
forms
and
rules
for
beautiful
speech
but
what
would
be
the
use
the
theory
of
ornament
was
always
in
the
background
tacitly
admitted
as
indisputable
by
all
juan
de

for
instance
makes
the
following
confession
of
stylistic
faith

also

here
it
seems
that
amplification
and
elegance
are
conceived
as
extraneous
to
the
meaning
or
a
gleam
of
truth
is
visible
in
montaigne
who
confronted
by
the

divide

is
to
say
they

remote
from
the
se
offerens
sidenote
reductio
ad
absurdum
in
the
seventeenth
century
the
impossibility
of
upholding
the
theory
of
ornament
was
first
noticed
during
the
decadence
of
italian
literature
in
the
seventeenth
century
when
literary
production
became
but
a
play
of
empty
forms
and
the
convenient
long
violated
in
practice
was
abandoned
and
forgotten
even
in
theory
and
came
to
be
looked
on
as
a
limit
arbitrarily
imposed
on
the
fundamental
principle
of
ornamentation
the
opponents
of
that
style
loaded
with
conceits
which
is
known
as
secentismo
from
its
prevalence
in
the
seventeenth
century
matteo
pellegrini
orsi
and
others
felt
the
viciousness
of
the
literary
production
of
their
day
they
were
aware
that
decadence
was
due
to
the
fact
that
literature
was
no
longer
the
serious
expression
of
a
content
but
they
were
embarrassed
by
the
reasoning
of
the
champions
of
bad
taste
who
were
able
to
demonstrate
that
the
whole
business
conformed
in
every
particular
with
the
literary
theory
of
ornament
the
common
ground
of
both
parties
in
vain
did
the
former
appeal
to
the
convenient
the
moderate
the
avoidance
of
affectation
to
ornament
as
condiment
not
food
and
all
the
other
weapons
which
had
sufficed
in
times
when
healthy
literary
production
and
sound
æsthetic
taste
had
automatically
corrected
faulty
theory
the
other
party
replied
there
was
no
reason
to
be
sparing
in
use
of
ornament
when
it
lay
in
masses
ready
to
hand
or
to
avoid
an
ostentatious
display
of
wit
when
one
had
an
inexhaustible
supply
sidenote
concerning
the
theory
of
the
same
reaction
against
the
abuse
of
ornament
against
spanish
and
italian
conceits
whose
supporters
had
been
gracian
in
spain
and
tesauro
in
italy

the
sharpest
critics

conceits
was
the
jesuit
bouhours
already
quoted
author
of
the
de
bien
penser
dans
les
œuvres
the
rhetorical
forms
were
the
subject
of
warm
controversy
orsi
on
national
grounds
the
opponent
of
bouhours
asserted
that
all
the
ornamental
devices
of
wit
rested
on
a
middle
term
and
could
be
reduced
to
a
rhetorical
syllogism
and
that
wit
consists
of
a
truth
which
appears
false
or
a
falsehood
which
appears
true
if
this
controversy
produced
no
great
scientific
result
at
the
time
at
least
it
prepared
the
mind
for
greater
liberty
and
as
we
have
remarked
elsewhere
it
may
have
influenced
vico
who
in
framing
his
new
concept
of
poetical
imagination
recognized
that
it
necessitated
a
wholesale
reconstruction
of
the
theory
of
rhetoric
and
the
conclusion
that
its
figures
and
tropes
are
not
caprices
of
pleasure
but
necessities
of
the
human
mind
sidenote
marsais
and
we
find
the
theory
of
rhetorical
ornament
jealously
kept
intact
by
baumgarten
and
meier
while
in
france
it
was
as
vigorously
assailed
by
césar
chesneau
du
marsais
who
published
in
a
treatise
on
the
seventh
part
of
his
wherein
he
develops
on
the
subject
of
metaphor
the
observation
already
made
by
montaigne
indeed
he
was
perhaps
inspired
by
montaigne
although
he
does
not
mention
his
name
du
marsais
remarks
that
it
is
said
that
figures
are
modes
of
speech
and
turns
of
expression
removed
from
the
ordinary
and
common
which
is
an
empty
phrase
as
good
as
saying
the
figured
differs
from
the
and
figures
are
figures
and
not
on
the
other
hand
it
is
wholly
untrue
that
figures
are
removed
from
ordinary
speech
for
nothing
is
more
natural
ordinary
and
common
than
figures
more
figures
of
speech
are
used
in
the
town
square
on
a
than
in
many
days
of
academical
discussion
and
no
speech
however
short
can
be
composed
entirely
of
expressions
and
du
marsais
gives
instances
of
quite
obvious
and
spontaneous
expressions
in
which
rhetoric
can
not
refuse
to
recognize
the
figures
of
apostrophe
congeries
interrogation
ellipsis
prosopopœia
the
apostles
were
persecuted
and
suffered
their
persecutions
with
patience

can
be
more
natural
than
the
description
given
by
paul
et
benedicimus
persecutionem
patimur
et
sustinemus
blasphemamur
et
yet
the
apostle
makes
use
of
a
fine
figure
of
antithesis
cursing
is
the
opposite
to
blessing
persecution
to
endurance
blasphemy
to
prayer
but
further
the
very
language
of
the
figure
is
figured
since
it
is
a
but
after
such
acute
observations
du
marsais
ends
by
himself
becoming
confused
and
defines
figures
as
manners
of
speech
differing
from
others
in
a
particular
modification
by
which
it
is
possible
to
reduce
each
one
to
a
species
apart
and
give
a
more
lively
noble
or
pleasing
effect
than
can
be
gained
by
a
manner
of
speech
expressing
the
same
content
of
thought
without
such
particular
modification
sidenote
but
the
psychological
interpretation
of
figures

speech
the
first
stage
towards
their
æsthetic
criticism
was
not
allowed
to
drop
here
in
his
of
criticism
home
says
that
he
had
long
questioned
whether
that
part
of
rhetoric
concerning
figures
might
not
be
reduced
to
rational
principles
and
had
finally
discovered
that
figures
consist
in
the
passional
element
he
set
himself
therefore
to
analyse
prosopopœia
apostrophe
and
hyperbole
in
the
light
of
the
passional

seems
to
have
been
confined

italian
romanticism
with
manzoni
at
its
head
destroyed
the

pretty
generally
accepted

masked

writer
rechristens
the
rhetorical
doctrine
of
tropes

figures
by
the
title
doctrine
of
the
forms
of
æsthetic
apperception
and
divides
them
into
the
four
categories

categories
reduced

biese

devoted

entire
book
to
metaphor
but
one
searches
it
in

for
a
serious
æsthetic
analysis
of
this
category
the
best
scientific
criticism
of
the
theory
of
ornament
is
found
scattered
throughout
the
writings
of
de
sanctis
who
when
lecturing
on
rhetoric
preached
what
he
called
but
even
here
the
criticism
is
not
conducted
from
a
strictly
systematic
point
of
view
it
seems
to
us
that
the
true
criticism
should
be
deduced
negatively
from
the
very
nature
of
æsthetic
activity
which
does
not
lend
itself
to
partition
there
is

abolishing
the

the

proper
to
each

has
almost
always
followed
the

of
the

traces
of
the
threefold
division
into
epic
lyric
and

in
plato
and
aristophanes
gives
an
example
of
criticism
according
to
the
canon
of
the
kinds
particularly
that
of
tragedy
but
the
most
conspicuous
theoretical
treatment
of
the
kinds
bequeathed
us
by
antiquity
is
precisely
the
doctrine
of
tragedy
which
forms
a
large
part
of
the
aristotelian
fragment
known
as

such

claiming
to
give
precepts
but
piccolomini
answered
that
all
these
things
and
other
similar
ones
are
shown
or
asserted
with
no
other
purpose
but
that
we
may
see
in
what
way
their
precepts
and
laws
must
be
obeyed
and
carried
out
just
as
to
make
a
hammer
or
saw
one
begins
by
describing
the
parts
of
which
they
are
composed
the
error
of
which
we
take
aristotle
as
representative
lies
in
transmuting
abstractions
and
empirical
partitions
into
rational
concepts
this
was
almost
inevitable
at
the
beginnings
of
æsthetic
reflexion
and
the
sanskrit
theory
of
poetry
employed
the
same
method
independently
when
for
example
it
defines
and
legislates
for
ten
principal
and
eighteen
secondary
styles
of
drama
varieties
of
hero
and
we
know
not
how
many
kinds
of
heroines
sidenote
the
middle
ages
and
after
aristotle
the
theory
of
poetic
kinds
does
not
seem
to
have
been
completely
or
elaborately
developed
in
antiquity
the
middle
ages
may
be
said
to
have
expressed
the
doctrine
in
treatises
of
the
kind
known
as
rhythmic
arts
or
methods
of
composition
when
the
aristotelian
fragment
was
first
noticed
it
is
curious
to
see
the
way
in
which
the
paraphrase
of
averroes
distorted
the
theory
of
kinds
averroes
conceives
tragedy
as
the
art
of
praise
comedy
as
that
of
blame
which
amounts
to
identifying
the
former
with
panegyric
the
latter
with
satire
and
he
believes
the
to
be
the
same
thing
as
antithesis
or
the
artifice
of
beginning
the
description
of
a
thing
by
describing
its
opposite
this
distortion
demonstrates
afresh
the
merely
historical
character
of
these
kinds
and
their
unintelligibility
by
the
methods
of
pure
logic
to
a
thinker
living
in
times
and
under
customs
different
from
those
of
the
hellenic
world
the
renaissance
seized
upon
aristotle
text
partly
expounded
it
partly
distorted
it
and
partly
thought
it
out
afresh
and
thus
succeeded
in
establishing
a
long
list
of
kinds
and
rigidly
defined
and
subjected
to
inexorable
laws
controversy
now
began
over
the
correct
understanding
of
the
unities
of
epic
or
dramatic
poetry
over
the
moral
quality
and
social
standing
proper
to
the
characters
in
this
kind
of
poem
and
in
that
over
the
nature
of
the
plot
and
whether
it
includes
passions
and
thoughts
and
whether
lyrics
should
or
should
not
be
received
as
true
poetry
whether
the
material
of
tragedy
should
be
historical
whether
the
dialogue
of
comedy
may
be
in
prose
whether
a
happy
ending
may
be
allowed
in
tragedy
whether
the
tragic
character
may
be
a
perfect
gentleman
what
kind
and
number
of
episodes
is
admissible
in
the
poem
and
how
they
should
be
incorporated
in
the
main
plot
and
so
on
great
anguish
was
caused
by
the
mysterious
rule
of
catharsis
found
in
black
and
white
in
aristotle
text
and
segni
naïvely
predicted
that
tragic
poetry
would
be
revived
in
its
perfect
spectacular
entirety
for
the
sake
of
experiencing
the
effect
spoken
of
by
aristotle
that
purgation
which
causes
the
birth
of
tranquillity
in
the
soul
and
of
freedom

all
perturbation
sidenote
doctrine
of
the
three
amongst
the
many
undertakings
brought
to
a
glorious
end
by
the
critics
and
of
the
sixteenth
century
the
best
known
is
the
establishment
of
the
three
unities
of
time
place
and
action
one
can
not
indeed
see
why
they
are
called
unities
for
in
strictness
they
could
at
most
be
spoken
of
as
shortness
of
time
straitness
of
space
and
limitation
of
tragic
subjects
to
a
certain
class
of
action
it
is
well
known
that
aristotle
prescribed
unity
of
action
only
and
reminded
his
hearers
that
theatrical
custom
alone
imposed
on
the
action
a
of
one
day
on
this
last
point
the
critics
of
the
sixteenth
century
accorded
six
eight
or
twelve
hours
according
to
individual
taste
or
humour
some
of
them
amongst
them
segni
allowed
hours
including
the
night
as
particularly
propitious
to
assassinations
and
the
other
acts
of
violence
which
usually
form
the
plot
of
tragedies
others
extended
the
limit
to
or
hours
the
last
and
most
curious
unity
that
of
place
was
slowly
developed
by
castelvetro
riccoboni
and
scaliger
until
the
frenchman
jean
de
la

joined
it
as
a
third
to
the
existing
two

in

the
italian

widely

all
over

and
awakened
the
first
effort
towards
a
learned
theory
of

in
france
spain
england
and
germany
a
good
representative
of
his
class
is
julius
cæsar
scaliger
who
has
been
considered
with
some
exaggeration
as
the
true
founder
of

as
one
who
it
has
been
said
laid
the
first
stone
of
the
classical
bastille
but
if
he
was
neither
the
first
nor
the
only
one
he
certainly
helped
greatly
to
reduce
to
a
system
of
doctrines
the
principal
consequences
of
the
sovranty
of
reason
in
works
of
literature
with
his
minute
distinctions
and

erected

it
has

that

entered
the

his
opposition
to

which
was
an
opposition
of

in
which
he
had
been
forestalled
by

by
calepio

radical
lessing
maintained
that
corneille
and
other
authors
had
misinterpreted
aristotle
to
whose
laws
even
the
shakespearian
drama
could
be
shown
to
conform
but
on
the
other
hand
he
strongly
opposed
the
abolition
of
all
rules

those
who
shouted

placing
genius
above
the

saying
that

very
reason

lessing
laws
have
their
value
and
can
be

entail
the

the
italian
renaissance
critics
while
working
at
their
poetics
in
the
style
of

found
themselves
confronted
with

note

firstly
as

begins
the
action
which
lawyers
call
prejudicial

controversy
arises
as
to
its
status
whether
it
is
a
poem
a
romance
a
tragedy
a
comedy
or
another
of
the
prescribed
kinds
and
if
the
said
work
have
ignored
the
slightest
precept
they
decree
forthwith
its
exile

perpetual
banishment

they
recast

can

not

anything
else

those

have

the
theory
of
the
limits
of
the

to

must
be
ascribed
the
merit
and
the
sole
glory
of
having
discovered
that
every
art
has
its
special
character
and
inviolable
limits
but
his
merit
lies
not
in
his
own
theory
which
in
itself
is
scarcely
tenable

in

though
by
an
error
aroused

highly

æsthetical
point

lessing
was
the
first
to
raise
clearly
the
question
of
the
value
attaching
to
the
distinction
between
the
various
arts
antiquity
the
middle
ages
and
the
renaissance
had
enumerated
the
arts
according
to
denominations
of
current
phraseology
and
had
composed

it
would
be

the

by

the
spirit
of
these
technical
is
entirely
different
some
rudiments
of
the
question
may
be
detected
in
the
comparisons
made
and
the
questions
of
precedence
raised
between

in

to
raise
the
question
in
the
attempt
to
controvert
the
strange
views
of
spence
concerning
the
close
union
between
painting
and
poetry
among
the
ancients
and
of
count
caylus
who
held
that
the
excellence
of
a
poem
must
be
judged
by
the
number
of
subjects
it
offers
to
the
brush
of
the
painter
he
was
further
instigated
by
the
comparisons
between
poetry
and
painting
upon
which
were
commonly
founded
the
most
ridiculous
rules
for
tragedy
the
maxim
pictura

whose
original
motive
was
to
emphasize
the
representative
or
imaginative
character
of
poetry
and
the
community
of
nature
among
the
arts
had
been
converted
by
superficial
interpretation
into
a
defence
of
the
most
vicious
intellectualistic
and
realistic
prejudices
lessing
argued
in
this
wise
if
painting
in
its
imitations
employs
precisely
a
medium
or
symbol
different
from
that
of
poetry
the
former
employing
spatial
forms
and
colours
the
latter
temporal
articulated
sounds
since
the
symbol
must
certainly
be
in
close
relation
with
that
which
is
signified
coexistent
symbols
can
only
express
coexistent
objects
or
parts
of
objects
and
consecutive
symbols
can
only
express
consecutive
objects
or
parts
of
objects
objects
mutually
coexistent
or
having
mutually
coexistent
parts
are
called
bodies
bodies
then
through
their
quality
of
visibility
are
the
true
objects
of
painting
objects
successively
consecutive
amongst
themselves
or
whose
parts
are
consecutive
are
called
in
general
actions
actions
then
are
the
suitable
objects
of
poetry
painting
undoubtedly
may
represent
action
but
only
by
means
of
bodies
which
indicate
it
and
poetry
may
represent
bodies
but
only
by
indicating
them
by
means
of
actions
when
a
poet
using
language
arbitrary
symbols
sets
himself
to
describe

he
is
no
longer
a
poet
but
a

true
is
this
says
he
that
animals
perceive
nothing
save

further
studied
the
various
unions
of
arbitrary
with
natural

as

of

which
the

that

its

those
who

of
preserving
the
naturalness
of

lessing
ended
by
condemning
the
custom
of
painting
objects
on
a
diminished
scale

i
think
that
the

an

it
is

the

we
rarely
find
a

thrown
on
their

such
dissentient
is
lotze

to

the

forming
themselves
into
no

in
the
world
of
thought
an
immense
variety
of

can
be
created
he
therefore
selected
one
of
these
possible
orders
not
because
it
was
the
sole
legitimate
one
but
because
it
was
convenient
his

imposed
by
a

no

plays
freely
with

subjects
them
to
the

of
an
end

by

can
not

are
incapable

a
recent
french
critic
basch
opens
his
treatise
with
the
following
excellent
remarks
is
it
necessary
to
show
there
is
no
such
thing
as
an
absolute
art
differentiating
itself
later
by
means
of
one

not
what
immanent
laws
what
exists

the
particular
forms

rather
artists
who
have
striven
to
translate
as
best
they
can
according
to
the
material
means
at
their
command
the
song
of
the
ideal
in
their
souls
but
later
on
he
thinks
it
possible
to
effect
a
division
of
the
arts
by
starting
from
the
artist
instead
of
the
art
in
itself
by
proceeding
according
to
the
three
great
types
of
fancy
visual
motor
and
auditory
and
as
for
the
debated
point
of
the
supreme
art
he
thinks
it
must
be
settled
in
favour
of
music
schasler
is
not
altogether
wrong
in
his
spirited
counterattack
on
lotze
criticism
he
protests
against
the
principle
of
indifference
and
convenience
and
remarks
that
the
classification
of
the
arts
must
be
regarded
as
the
real
touchstone
the
real
differential
test
of
the
scientific
value
of
an
æsthetic
system
for
on
this
point
all
theoretical
questions
are
concentrated
and
crowd
together
to
find
a
concrete
solution
sidenote
in
the
principle
of
convenience
may
be
excellent
as
applied
to
the
approximative
grouping
of
botanical
or
zoological
classifications
but
it
has
no
place
in
philosophy
and
as
lotze
in
common
with
schasler
and
other
æstheticians
conformed
to
lessing
principle
of
the
constancy
limits
and
peculiar
nature
of
each
art
and
therefore
held
that
the
concepts
of
the
individual
arts
were
speculative
and
not
empirical
concepts
he
could
not
evade
the
duty
of
fixing
the
mutual
relations
of
these
concepts
arranging
them
in
series
subordinating
and
them
and
arriving
at
each
of
them
either
deductively
or
dialectically
he
ought
in
order
to
get
definitely
rid
of
these
barren
attempts
at
classification
and
at
discovering
the
supreme
art
to
have
criticized
and
dissolved
lessing
principle
itself
to
keep
the
principle
and
deny
the
need
for
a
classification
as
lotze
did
was
obviously
inconsistent
but
not
a
single
æsthetician
has
ever
or
investigated
the
scientific
foundation
of
the
distinctions
enunciated
by
lessing
in
his
fluent
and
elegant
prose
no
one
has
probed
to
the
bottom
the
truth
which
was
illumined
by
aristotle
in
a
single
when
he
refused
to
allow
an
extrinsic
difference
that
of
metre
as
the
real
distinction
between
prose
and
poetry
no
one
that
is
to
say
save
perhaps
schleiermacher
who
at
least
called
attention
to
the
difficulties
of
the
current
doctrine
sidenote
in
he
proposed
to
start
from
the
general
concept
of
art
and
prove
by
deduction
the
necessity
of
all
its
forms
and
after
finding
two
sides
to
artistic
activity
the
objective
consciousness
and
the
immediate
consciousness
and
observing
that
art
stands
wholly
neither
in
the
one
nor
in
the
other
and
that
the
immediate
consciousness
or
representation
gives
rise
to
mimicry
and
music
while
the
objective
consciousness
or
image
gives
rise
to
the
figurative
arts
he
then
proceeding
to
analyse
a
painting
found
the
two
forms
of
consciousness
to
be
in
this
case
inseparable
and
remarks
here
we
arrive
at
the
precise
opposite
searching
for
distinction
we
find
unity
nor
did
the
traditional
division
of
the
arts
into
simultaneous
and
successive
seem
to
him
very
solid
for
when
looked
at
attentively
it
evaporates
entirely
in
architecture
or
gardening
contemplation
is
successive
while
in
the
arts
labelled
as
successive
such
as
poetry
the
chief
thing
is
coexistence
and
grouping
from
whichever
side
we
look
at
it
the
difference
is
but
secondary
and
the
antithesis
between
the
two
orders
of
art
merely
means
that
every
contemplation
like
every
act
of
production
is
always
successive
but
in
thinking
out
the
relation
of
the
two
sides
in
a
work
of
art
both
seem
indispensable
coexistence
and
successive
existence
in
another
passage
he
observes
the
reality
of
art
as
external
appearance
is
conditioned
by
the
mode
depending
on
our
physical
and
corporeal
organism
in
which
the
internal
is
externalised
movements
forms
words
that
which
is
common
to
all
arts
is
not
the
external
which
is
rather
the
element
of
diversification
when
these
observations
are
compared
with
the
sharp
distinction
he
himself
drew
between
art
and
technique
it
would
be
easy
to
deduce
that
he
held
the
partitions
of
the
arts
and
the
concepts
of
the
particular
arts
to
be
devoid
of
æsthetic
value
but
schleiermacher
does
not
draw
this
logical
inference
he
wavers
and
hesitates
he
recognizes
the
inseparability
of
the
subjective
and
objective
musical
and
figurative
elements
in
poetry
yet
he
struggles
to
discover
the
definitions
and
limits
of
the
individual
arts
sometimes
he
dreams
of
a
union
of
the
various
arts
from
which
a
complete
art
would
spring
and
when
composing
the
syllabus
of
his
lectures
on
æsthetic
he
arranged
the
arts
into
arts
of
accompaniment
mimicry
and
music
figurative
arts
architecture
gardening
painting
sculpture
and
poetry
nebulous
vague
contradictory
as
this
may
be
schleiermacher
had
the
acumen
to
distrust
the
soundness
of
lessing
theory
and
to
inquire
by
what
right
particular
arts
are
singled
out
from
art

only

as
it
seems
to
exclude

are
attached

important
contributions
towards
the
correction
of
this
imperfect
and
element
were
supplied
by

and

study

for

promoted
successfully
by

continued
by
laprade
biese
and

of
his
own
vischer
completes
the
passage
from
the
metaphysical
construction
of
beauty
in
nature
to
the
psychological
interpretation
of
it
and
recognizes
the
necessity
of
suppressing
the
section
devoted
to
natural
beauty
in
his
first
æsthetic
system
and
incorporating
it
with
the
doctrine
of
imagination
he
says
that
such
treatments
do
not
belong
to
æsthetic
science
being
a
medley
of
zoology
sentiment
fantasy
and
humour
worthy
of
development
in

in
the
style
of
the
poet
fischer
on
the
life
of
birds
or
bratranek
on
the
æsthetic
of
the
vegetable
world
hartmann
as
heir
of
the
old
metaphysics
reproaches
vischer
for
this
exclusion
and
maintains
that
in
addition
to
the
beauty
of
imagination
introduced
by
man
into
natural
things
there
exist
a
formal
and
a
substantial
beauty
in
nature
coinciding
with
realisation
of
the
immanent
ends
or
ideas
of
nature
but
the
way
chosen
ultimately
by
vischer
is
the
only
one
by
which
schleiermacher
thesis
can
be
successfully
developed
so
as
to
show
the
precise
meaning
which
may
be
given
to
the
assertion
of
æsthetic
beauty
in
nature
sidenote
theory
of
æsthetic
ii
that
æsthetic
senses
or
superior
senses
exist
and
that
beauty
attaches
to
certain
senses
only
not
to
all
is
a
very
old
opinion
we
have
seen
already
that
socrates
in
the
maior
mentions
the
doctrine
of
beauty
as
that
which
pleases
hearing
and
sight
τὸ
καlὸν
eστὶ
τὸ
δι
ἀκοῆs
τε
καὶ
ὃψεως
ήδύ
and
he
adds
it
seems
impossible
to
deny
that
we
take
pleasure
in
looking
at
handsome
men
and
fine
ornaments
pictures
and
statues
with
our
eyes
and
hearing
beautiful
songs
or
beautiful
voices
music
speeches
and
conversations
with
our
ears
nevertheless
socrates
himself
in
the
same
dialogue
confutes
this
theory
by
perfectly
valid
arguments
amongst
which
is
that
besides
the
difficulty
arising
from
the
fact
that
beautiful
things
may
be
found
outside
the
range
of
the
sensible
impressions
of
eye
and
ear
there
is
no
reason
for
creating
a
special
class
for
the
pleasure
arising
from
impressions
on
these
two
senses
to
the
exclusion
of
others
he
also
states
the
more
subtle
and
philosophical
objection
that
that
which
is
pleasing
to
the
sight
is
not
so
to
the
hearing
and
whence
it
follows
that
the
ground
of
beauty
must
not
be
sought
in
visibility
or
audibility
but
in
something
differing
from
either
and
common
to
both
the
problem
was
never
again
perhaps
attacked
with
such
acumen
and
seriousness
as
in
this
ancient
dialogue
in
the
eighteenth
century
home
remarked
that
beauty
depended
on
sight
and
that
impressions
received
by
the
other
senses
might
be
agreeable
but
were
not
beautiful
and
distinguished
sight
and
hearing
as
superior
to
those
of
touch
taste
and
smell
the
latter
being
merely
bodily
in
nature
and
without
the
spiritual
refinement
of
the
other
two
he
held
these
to
produce
pleasures
superior
to
organic
pleasures
though
inferior
to
intellectual
decorous
pleasures
that
is
to
say
elevated
sweet
moderately
exhilarating
as
far
removed
from
the
turbulence
of
the
passions
as
from
the
languor
of
indolence
and
intended
to
refresh
and
soothe
the
spirit
following
suggestions
of
diderot
rousseau
and
berkeley
herder
drew
attention
to
the
importance
of
the
sense
of
touch
in
plastic
art
of
this
third
sense
which
perhaps
deserves
to
be
investigated
first
of
all
and
is
unjustly
relegated
to
a
place
amongst
the
grosser
senses
certainly
touch
knows
nothing
of
surface
or
colour
but
sight
for
its
part
knows
nothing
of
forms
and
configurations
thus
touch
can
not
be
so
gross
a
sense
as
it
is
reputed
if
it
is
the
very
organ
by
which
we
sensate
all
other
bodies
and
rules
over
a
vast
kingdom
of
subtle
and
complex
concepts
as
the
surface
stands
to
the
body
so
does
sight
stand
in
respect
of
touch
and
it
is
merely
a
colloquial
abbreviation
to
speak
of
seeing
bodies
as
surfaces
and
to
suppose
that
we
see
with
our
eyes
that
which
we
have
gradually
learnt
in
infancy
simply
by
the
sense
of
touch
every
beauty
of
form
or
corporeity
is
a
concept
not
visible
but
palpable
from
the
triad
of
æsthetic
senses
thus
established
by
herder

for
painting
hearing
for
music
touch
for
sculpture
hegel
returned
to
the
customary
dyad
saying
that
the
sensory
part
of
art
has
reference
only
to
the
two
theoretic
senses
of
sight
and
hearing
that
smell
taste
and
touch
must
be
excluded
from
artistic
pleasures
since
they
are
connected
with
matter
as
such
and
the
immediate
sensible
quality
it
may
possess
smell
with
material
volatilization
taste
with
material
solution
of
objects
and
touch
with
hot
cold
smooth
and
so
forth
and
that
hence
they
can
claim
no
concern
with
the
objects
of
art
which
are
obliged
to
keep
themselves
in
real
independence
rejecting
all
relation
with
the
merely
sensory
that
which
pleases
these
senses
is
not
the
beautiful
of
art
it
was
schleiermacher
once
more
who
recognized
the
impossibility
of
disposing
of
the
matter
in
this
summary
fashion
he
refused
to
admit
the
distinction
between
confused
senses
and
clear
senses
and
asserted
that
the
superiority
of
sight
and
hearing
over
the
other
senses
lay
in
the
fact
that
the
others
are
not
capable
of
any
free
activity
and
indeed
represent
the
maximum
of
passivity
whereas
sight
and
hearing
are
capable
of
an
activity
proceeding
from
within
and
are
able
to
produce
forms
and
notes
without
having
received
impressions
from
outside
were
eye
and
ear
merely
means
of
perception
there
would
be
no
visual
or
auditory
arts
but
they
also
operate
as
a
function
of
voluntary
movements
which
supply
a
content
to
the
dominion
of
the
senses
from
another
standpoint
however
schleiermacher
thinks
that
the
difference
seems
to
be
one
rather
of
degree
or
quantity
and
a
minimum
of
independence
must
be
recognized
as
existing
in
the
other
senses
as
well
vischer
remains
faithful
to
the
traditional
two
æsthetic
senses
free
organs
and
no
less
spiritual
than
sensuous
which
have
no
reference
to
the
material
composition
of
the
object
but
allow
this
to
subsist
as
a
whole
and
work
upon
them
köstlin
was
of
opinion
that
the
inferior
senses
offer
nothing
intuitible
separate
from
themselves
and
are
only
modifications
of
ourselves
but
taste
smell
and
touch
are
not
devoid
of
all
æsthetic
importance
since
they
assist
the
superior
senses
without
touch
an
image
could
not
be
recognized
by
the
eye
as
being
hard
resistant
or
rough
without
smell
certain
images
could
not
be
represented
as
sweet
or
scented
we
can
not
go
into
a
detailed
account
of
all
doctrines
connected
with
sensationalistic
principles
for
all
the
senses
are
naturally
accepted
as
æsthetic
by
the
sensationalists
who
use
æsthetic
interchangeably
with
hedonistic
it
will
suffice
if
we
recall
the
learned
kralik
who
was
ridiculed
by
tolstoy
for
his
theory
of
the
five
arts
of
taste
smell
touch
hearing
and
sight
the
few
quotations
already
given
show
the
embarrassing
difficulty
caused
by
the
use
of
the
word
æsthetic
as
a
qualification
of
sense
compelling
writers
to
invent
absurd
distinctions
between
various
groups
of
senses
or
to
recognize
all
senses
as
being
æsthetic
thus
giving
æsthetic
value
to
every
sensory
impression
as
such
no
way
out
of
this
labyrinth
can
be
found
save
by
asserting
the
impossibility
of
effecting
a
union
between
such
wholly
disparate
orders
of
ideas
as
the
concept
of
the
representative
form
of
the
spirit
and
that
of
particular
physiological
organs

a
particular

of
sidenote

a
variety
of
the
error
of
literary
kinds
is
to
be
found
in
the
theory
of
modes
forms
or
kinds
of
style
χαρακτῆρες

considered
by
the
ancients
as
consisting
of
three
forms
the
sublime
the

the
tenuous

tripartition
due

would
seem
to
antisthenes
modified
later
into
and
or
amplified
into
a
fourfold
division
or
designated
by
adjectives
of
historic
origin
as
in
the
attic
asiatic
or
rhodian
styles
the
middle
ages
preserved
the
tradition
of
a
tripartite
division
sometimes
giving
it
a
curious
interpretation
to
the
effect
that
the
sublime
style
treats
of
kings
princes
and
barons
the
the
mediocre
of
people
georgies
the
humble
of
the
lowest
class
bucolics
and
the
three
styles
were
for
this
reason
also
called
tragic
elegiac
and
comic
it
is
a
fact
that
kinds
in
style
have
never
ceased
to
afford
matter
for
discussion
in
rhetorical
down
to
modern
times
for
instance
we
find
blair
distinguishing
styles
by
such
epithets
as
the
diffuse
the
concise
the
nervous
the
daring
the
soft
the
elegant
the
flowery
etc
in
the
italian
melchiorre
delfico
in
his
book
on
beautiful
energetically
criticized
the
endless
division
of
styles
or
the
superstition
that
there
could
be
so
many
kinds
of
style
saying
that
style
is
either
good
or
bad
and
adding
that
it
is
not
possible
it
should
exist
as
a
preconceived
idea
in
the
artist
mind
but
that
it
should
be
the
consequence
of
the
principal
idea
that
conception
which
determines
the
invention
and
the
composition
sidenote
theory

the
same
error
reappears
in
the
philosophy
of
language
as
the
theory
of
grammatical
forms
or
parts
of
speech
first
created
by
the
sophists
protagoras
is
credited
with
having
first
distinguished
the
gender
of
nouns
adopted
by
the
philosophers
notably
by
aristotle
and
the
stoics
the
former
was
acquainted
with
two
or
three
parts
of
speech
the
latter
with
four
or
five
developed
and
elaborated
by
the
alexandrian
grammarians
in
the
famous
and
endless
controversy
between
the
analogists
and
the
anomalists
the
analogists
aristarchus
aimed
at
introducing
logical
order
and
regularity
into
linguistic
facts
and
described
as
deviations
all
such
as
seemed
to
them
irreducible
to
logical
form
these
they
called
pleonasm
ellipsis
enallage
parallage
and
metalepsis
the
violence
thus
wrought
by
the
analogists
upon
spoken
and
written
language
was
such
that
as
quintilian
tells
us
some
one
wittily
remarked
that
it
appeared
to
be
one
thing
to
talk
latin
and
quite
another
to
talk
grammar
esse
grammatice
the
anomalists
must
be
credited
with
restoring
to
language
its
free
imaginative
movement
the
stoic
chrysippus
composed
a
treatise
to
prove
that
one
thing
one
same
concept
may
be
expressed
by
different
sounds
and
one
and
the
same
sound
may
express
different
concepts
res
dissimilibus
verbis
et
similibus
dissimiles
esse
vocabulis
another
anomalist
was
the
celebrated
grammarian
apollonius
dyscolus
who
rejected
the
metalepsis
the
schemes
and
the
other
artifices
by
which
the
analogists
tried
to
explain
facts
which
did
not
fit
their
categories
and
pointed
out
that
the
use
of
one
word
for
another
or
one
part
of
speech
for
another
is
not
a
grammatical
figure
but
a
blunder
a
thing
hardly
to
be
attributed
to
a
poet
such
as
homer
the
upshot
of
the
dispute
between
anomalists
and
analogists
was
the
science
of
grammar
τεχνη
γραμματική
as
handed
down
by
the
ancients
to
the
modern
world
which
is
justly
considered
as
a
sort
of
compromise
between
the
two
opposed
parties
because
if
the
schemes
of
inflection
κανόνες
satisfy
the
demands
of
the
analogists
their
variety
satisfies
those
of
the
anomalists
hence
the
original
definition
of
grammar
as
theory
of
analogy
was
changed
subsequently
to
theory
of
analogy
and
anomaly
ὁμοίον
τε
καὶ
ἀνoμoίου

the
concept
of
correct
usage
with
which
varro
hoped
to
settle
the
controversy
fell
into
the
trap
common
to
compromises
merely
stating
the
contradiction
in
set
terms
like
the
convenient
ornament
of
rhetoric
or
the
kinds
accorded
a
certain
licence
in
the
literature
of
precept
if
language
follows
usage
that
is
to
say
the
imagination
it
does
not
follow
reason
or
logic
if
it
follows
reason
it
does
not
follow
usage
when
the
analogists
upheld
logic
as
supreme
at
least
inside
the
individual
kinds
and
the
anomalists
hastened
to
show
that
even
this
was
not
the
case
varro
himself
was
forced
to
confess
that
this
part
of
the
subject
really
is
very
difficult

in
the
middle
ages
grammar
was
cultivated
to
the
point
of

divine
inspiration
was
found
lurking
in
the
eight

pott

survive
the
reason
may
lie
in
the
facts
that

not
do
without
them
that
their
venerable
antiquity
disguises
their
illegitimate
and
shady

sidenote
of

the
relativity
of
taste
is
a
sensationalistic
theory
which
denies
a
spiritual
value
to
art
but
it
is
rarely
maintained
by
writers
in
the
ingenuous
categorical
garb
of
the
old
adage
gustibus
non
est
concerning
which
it
would
be
useful
to
enquire
when
the
saying
was
born
and
what
it
fust
meant
whether
too
the
word
referred
solely
to
impressions
of
the
palate
and
was
only
later
extended
to
include
æsthetic
impressions
as
though
sensationalists
as
if
dimly
conscious
of
the
higher
nature
of
art
have
never
been
able
to
resign
themselves
to
the
complete
relativity
of
taste
their
torments
in
the
matter
really
move
one
to
pity
is
there
batteux
asks
such
a
thing
as
good
taste
and
is
it
the
only
good
taste
in
what
does
it
consist
upon
what
depend
does
it
depend
upon
the
object
itself
or
the
genius
at
work
upon
it
are
there
or
are
there
not
rules
is
wit
alone
or
heart
alone
the
organ
of
taste
or
both
together
how
many
questions
have
been
raised
on
this
familiar
subject
how
many
obscure
and
involved
answers
have
been
given
this
perplexity
is
shared
by
home
tastes
he
says
must
not
be
disputed
neither
those
of
the
palate
nor
those
of
other
senses
a
remark
which
seems
highly
reasonable
from
one
point
of
view
but
from
another
somewhat
exaggerated
but
yet
how
can
one
dispute
it
how
can
one
maintain
that
what
actually
pleases
a
man
ought
not
to
please
him
the
proposition
then
must
be
true
but
now
no
man
of
taste
will
assent
to
it
we
speak
of
good
taste
and
bad
taste
are
all
criticisms
which
turn
upon
this
distinction
to
be
considered
absurd
have
these
everyday
expressions
no
meaning
home
ends
by
asserting
a
common
standard
of
taste
deduced
from
the
necessity
of
a
common
life
for
mankind
or
as
he
says
from
a
final
cause
for
without
uniformity
of
taste
who
would
trouble
to
produce
works
of
art
build
elegant
and
costly
edifices
or
lay
out
beautiful
gardens
and
so
forth
he
does
not
fail
to
draw
attention
to
a
second
final
cause
that
of
the
advisability
of
attracting
citizens
to
public
shows
and
uniting
those
whom
and
diversity
of
occupation
tend
to
keep
apart
but
how
shall
a
standard
of
taste
be
established
this
is
a
new
perplexity
which
one
can
not
think
to
be
escaped
by
observing
that
as
in
framing
moral
rules
we
seek
the
counsel
of
the
most
honourable
of
educated
men
not
of
savages
so
to
determine
the
standard
of
taste
we
should
have
recourse
to
the
few
who
are
not
worn
out
by
degrading
bodily
labour
not
corrupted
in
taste
and
not
rendered
effeminate
by
pleasure
who
have
received
the
gift
of
good
taste
from
nature
and
have
brought
it
to
perfection
by
the
education
and
practice
of
a
lifetime
if
notwithstanding
controversies
arise
then
reference
must
be
made
to
the
principles
of
criticism
as
set
forth
by
home
himself
in
his
own
book
similar
contradictions
and
vicious
circles
reappear
in
david
hume
on
taste
where
hume
tries
in
vain
to
define
the
distinctive
characteristics
of
the
man
of
taste
whose
judgement
must
be
law
and
while
asserting
the
uniformity
of
the
general
principles
of
taste
as
founded
in
human
nature
and
warning
the
reader
against
giving
undue
weight
to
individual
perversions
and
ignorances
at
the
same
time
asserts
that
divergences
in
taste
may
be
irreconcilable
insuperable
and
yet
blameless
but
a
criticism
of
æsthetic
relativism
can
not
be
based
upon
the
opposite
doctrine
which
by
its
affirmation
of
absoluteness
resolves
taste
into
concepts
and
logical
inferences
the
eighteenth
century
offers
examples
of
this
mistake
in
muratori
one
of
the
first
to
maintain
the
existence
of
a
rule
of
taste
and
a
universal
beauty
whose
rules
are
furnished
by
poetics
in
andré
who
said
that
the
beauty
in
a
work
of
art
is
not
that
which
pleases
at
the
first
glance
of
fancy
through
certain
individual
dispositions
of
the
mental
faculties
or
bodily
organs
but
that
which
has
a
right
to
please
the
reason
and
reflexion
by
its
own
inherent
excellence
or
rightness
and
if
the
expression
be
allowed
by
its
intrinsic
agreeableness
in
voltaire
who
recognized
a
universal
taste
which
was
intellectual
and
in
very
many
others
this
intellectualistic
error
no
less
than
the
sensationalistic
was
attacked
by
kant
but
even
kant
by
making
beauty
consist
in
a
symbolism
of
morality
failed
to
grasp
the
concept
of
an
imaginative
absoluteness
of
taste
succeeding
generations
of
philosophers
met
the
difficulty
by
passing
it
over
in
silence
nevertheless
this
criterion
of
an
imaginative
absoluteness
the
idea
that
in
order
to
judge
works
of
art
one
must
place
oneself
at
the
artist
point
of
view
at
the
moment
of
production
and
that
to
judge
is
to
reproduce
gathered
weight
little
by
little
from
the
beginning
of
the
eighteenth
century
when
its
first
appearance
is
seen
in
the
work
of
the
italian
francesco
montani
already
quoted
and
by
the
english
poet
alexander
pope
in
his
on
a

read
each
work
of

with
the
same
spirit
that
its
author
writ
a
few
years
later
antonio
conti
recognized
part
of
the
truth
in
the
du
premier
advised
by
terrasson
as
a
test
for
judging
poetry
while
noting
it
to
be
more
applicable
to
modern
than
to
ancient
works

to

in

the

the
critic
must
not
pretend
to
be

manifest
itself
to

the

suffocate

any

this
state
of
fanatical
admiration
can
not
last
long
reason
must
inevitably
recover
consciousness
of
itself
and
direct
its
attention
upon
the
state
in
which
it
was
during
the
enjoyment
of
beauty
and
upon
its
present
memories
of
that
state
this
was
the
wholesomely
impressionistic
theory
which
prevailed
among
the
romanticists
and
was
accepted
even
by
de
sanctis
still
there
was
even
then
no
definite
theory
of
criticism
which
demanded
as
its
condition
of
existence
a
precise
concept
of
art
and
of
the
relations
of
the
work
of
art
with
its
historical
antecedents
the
very
possibility
of
æsthetic
criticism
was
questioned
in
the
second
half
of
the
nineteenth
century
when
taste
was
relegated
to
a
place
amongst
the
facts
of
individual
caprice
and
a
historical
criticism
was
proclaimed
the
sole
scientific
criticism
and
expounded
in
works
of
irrelevant
learning
or
buried
beneath
the
preconceptions
of
positivists
and
materialists
those
who
reacted
against
such
extremalism
and
materialism
generally
made
the
mistake
of
supporting
themselves
by
a
kind
of
intellectualistic
dogmatism
or
an
empty
æstheticism
sidenote
between
taste
and
vi
we
have
seen
that
in
the
seventeenth
century
when
the
words
taste
and
genius
or
wit
were
in
fashion
the
facts
they
designated
were
sometimes
interchanged
amongst
themselves
and
came
to
be
considered
as
one
single
fact
while
sometimes
each
was
conceived
as
distinct
in
itself
genius
being
the
faculty
of
production
and
taste
the
faculty
of
judgement
taste
being
further
subdivided
into
the
sterile
and
the
fertile
a
terminology
adopted
by
muratori
in
italy
and
ulrich
könig
in
germany
batteux
said
goût
juge
des
productions
du
and
kant
speaks
of
defective
works
having
genius
without
taste
or
taste
without
genius
and
of
others
in
which
taste
alone
suffices
now
we
find
him
distinguishing
the
two
concepts
as
the
judging
and
producing
faculties
now
he
speaks
of
them
as
a
single
faculty
existing
in
various
degrees
an
inherent
difference
between
taste
and
genius
was
accepted
by
later
writers
on
æsthetic
and
assumed
its
most
rigid
form
in
the
hands
of
herbart
and
his
followers
sidenote
of
artistic
and

vii
the
evolutionary
theory
of
art
made
its
appearance
towards
the
end
of
the
eighteenth
century
this
was
the
time
when
the
distinction
between
classical
and
romantic
art
was
first
made
a
classification
later
augmented
by
an
introductory
section
on
oriental
art
owing
to
the
increase
of
knowledge
concerning
the
world
towards
the
end
of
his
life
goethe
told
his
friend
eckermann
that
the
concepts
of
classical
and
romantic
had
been
formed
by
himself
and
schiller
for
he
himself
had
upheld
the
objective
method
in
poetry
whilst
schiller
in
order
to
champion
the
subjective
form
to
which
he
inclined
had
written
the
essay
naïve
and
sentimental
in
which
the
word
naïve
expresses
the
style
later
called
classical
and
the
word
sentimental
that
later
called
romantic
the
schlegels
continues
goethe
seized
upon
these
ideas
and
disseminated
them
so
that
everyone
uses
them
and
speaks
of
classical
and
romantic
things
perfectly
unknown
fifty
years
ago
goethe
was
speaking
in
schiller
essay
bears
the
imprint
of
influence
and
is
dated
it
contains
such
statements
as
this
poets
are
above
all
things
the
preservers
of
nature
and
when
they
can
not
be
so
entirely
and
have
tried
upon
themselves
the
destructive
force
of
arbitrary
and
artificial
forms
or
have
fought
against
such
forms
they
stand
up
to
bear
witness
on
her
behalf
poets
therefore
either
are
nature
or
having
lost
her
seek
her
hence
arise
two
wholly
distinct
kinds
of
poetic
composition
exhausting
between
them
the
whole
field
of
poetry
all
poets
who
are
worthy
of
the
name
must
belong
according
to
the
times
and
conditions
in
which
they
flourish
either
to
the
category
of
naïve
or
to
that
of
sentimental
poets
schiller
recognized
three
kinds
of
sentimental
poetry
satirical
elegiac
and
idyllic
he
defined
a
satirical
poet
as
one
who
takes
as
his
object
the
desertion
of
nature
and
the
contrast
of
the
real
with
the
ideal
the
weak
point
of
this
division
is
the
concept
of
two
distinct
kinds
of
poetry
the
reduction
of
the
infinite
forms
in
which
poetry
appears
to
individuals
to
two
kinds
if
one
of
these
two
kinds
be
taken
the
perfect
and
the
other
as
the
imperfect
kind
the
mistake
is
made
of
converting
imperfection
into
a
kind
or
species
the
negative
into
a
positive
wilhelm
von
humboldt
pointed
out
to
his
friend
that
if
form
is
the
essence
of
art
there
can
not
be
a
kind
of
poetry
such
as
the
sentimental
or
romantic
is
supposed
to
be
in
which
matter
preponderates
over
form
for
that
would
constitute
a
not
a
separate
kind
of
art
schiller
attached
no
historical
meaning
to
his
classification
in
fact
he
declared
explicitly
that
in
using
the
words
ancient
and
modern
as
equivalent
to
ingenuous
and
sentimental
he
did
not
mean
to
deny
that
some
ancient
poets
in
his
sense
of
the
word
could
be
found
among
contemporary
writers
the
two
characters
might
even
be
united
in
the
same
poet
or
the
same
poetical
work
as
to
give
schiller
own
example
in
the
first
to
assign
a
historical
meaning
to
the
division
were
friedrich
and
wilhelm
von
schlegel
the
former
in
an
early
work
of
the
latter
in
his
celebrated
lectures
on
literary
history
given
at
berlin
in
but
the
two
senses
systematic
and
historical
were
variously
alternated
and
mixed
by
literary
men
and
critics
and
other
distinctions
were
added
classical
was
sometimes
used
to
describe
poetry
of
a
frigid
and
imitative
style
while
romantic
poetry
was
the
inspired
in
some
countries
the
word
romantic
came
to
mean
a
political
reactionary
in
italy
it
stood
for
liberal
and
so
forth
in
when
friedrich
schlegel
spoke
of
ancient
persian
romantic
poems
or
when
in
our
times
attention
is
called
to
the
romanticism
of
the
greek
latin
or
french
classics
the
historical
signification
is
lost
in
the
theoretical
the
sense
originally
intended
by
schiller
but
the
historical
sense
was
prevalent
in
german
idealism
which
inclined
towards
the
construction
of
a
universal
history
including
that
of
literature
and
art
upon
a
scheme
of
ideal
evolution
schelling
made
a
sharp
division
between
pagan
and
christian
art
the
second
being
held
an
advance
upon
the
former
which
was
the
lowest
step
hegel
accepted
this
division
and
introduced
a
final
regress
by
dividing
the
history
of
art
into
three
periods
symbolic
oriental
art
classical
hellenic
and
romantic
modern
just
as
he
conceived
roman
art
with
its
introduction
of
satire
and
other
kinds
indicative
of
a
failure
to
maintain
harmony
between
form
and
content
as
the
dissolution
of
classical
art
a
thought
suggested
by
schiller
so
he
found
in
the
subjective
humour
of
cervantes
and
ariosto
the
dissolution
of
romantic
art
and
he
regarded
this
series
as
completing
the
possibilities
of
art
though
some
interpreters
think
that
by
a
he
admitted
the
possibility
of
a
fourth
period
an
art
of
the
modern
or
future
world
indeed
amongst
his
disciples
we
find
weiss
rejecting
the
oriental
period
in
order
to
save
the
triadic
division
and
placing
as
third
the
modern
period
synthesis
of
the
ancient
and
the
mediæval
vischer
too
inclines
to
recognize
a
modern
or
progressive
period
these
arbitrary
constructions
reappear
in
the
works
of
positivist
metaphysicians
in
the
shape
of
an
evolutionary
or
progressive
history
of
art
spencer
dreamed
of
writing
some
sort
of
treatise
on
the
subject
and
in
the
published
programme
of
his
system
we
read
that
the
third
volume
of
his
of
was
to
contain
amongst
other
things
a
chapter
on
æsthetic
progress
with
the
gradual
differentiation
of
fine
arts
from
primitive
institutions
and
from
each
other
with
their
increasing
variety
in
development
their
progress
in
reality
of
expression
and
superiority
of
end
no
grief
need
be
felt
that
the
chapter
was
left
unwritten
when
we
remember
the
samples
of
it
preserved
in
the
of
and
already
reviewed
in
these
pages
the
strong
historical
sense
of
our
own
day
is
leading
us
further
and
further
away
from
the
evolutionary
or
abstractly
progressive
theories
which
falsify
the
free
and
original
movement
of
art
fiedler
remarked
not
without
justice
that
unity
and
progress
can
not
be
introduced
into
a
history
of
art
and
that
the
works
of
artists
must
be
judged
discretely
as
so
many
fragments
of
the
life
of
the
universe
in
recent
times
a
remarkable
student
of
the
history
of
figurative
art
venturi
has
tried
to
bring
evolutionism
into
fashion
and
has
illustrated
it
in
a
of
the
madonna
in
which
the
presentment
of
the
virgin
is
conceived
as
an
organism
which
is
born
grows
attains
perfection
grows
old
and
dies
others
have
claimed
for
artistic
history
its
true
character
intolerant
of
outward
curb
and
rule
drawing
her
productions
from
the
of
the
infinite
spirit
these
hurried
notes
may
suffice
to
show
in
how
narrow
a
circle
has
hitherto
moved
the
scientific
criticism
of
the
errors
we
have
called
particular
æsthetic
needs
to
be
surrounded
and
nourished
by
a
watchful
and
vigorous
critical
literature

its

his

lectures
on
the
criticism

the

of
the
fine
arts
in

with

summary
of
the
origin

progress
of
these
studies
premising
that
he
will
treat
of

only
and
that
his

the
introduction
treats

koller
observes
that
the
names
and
form
of
a
general
theory
of
fine
art
and
criticism
of
taste
were
unknown
to
the
ancients
whose
imperfect
ethical
theory
prevented
their
producing
anything
in

field
he
dedicates
to
the
italians

the

with
the
passage
from

passes
at
once
to
baumgarten
the
theoretical
epoch
owes
its
existence
undeniably
to
baumgarten
to
him
belongs
the
inalienable
merit
of
having
first
conceived
an
æsthetic
founded
on
principles
of
reason
and
wholly
developed
and
of
having
tried
to
put
it
into
practice
by
the
means
offered
him
by
his

philosophy
immediately
after

with
the
remark
that
prior
to
the
appearance
of
the
of

æstheticians
were
divided
into
sceptics
dogmatics
and
empiricists
the
most
powerful
intellects
of
the
nation
inclined
towards
empiricism
so
much
so
that
had
kant
himself
been
asked
by
what
literature
he
had
been
most
strongly
influenced
in
the
development
of
his
own
thought
he
would
certainly
have
named
the
acute
empirical
writers
of

and
germany

by
no
method
had
it
been
possible
to
establish

outlines
of

history

by

it

mainly
of
a
rich
collection
of
extracts
and
abridgements
of
ancient

modern
books
treating
of
æsthetic
in
this
respect
the
most
noteworthy
chapters
are
those
on

great

and
america
the
second
volume
published

an
appendix

eighteenth
century
vol
modern
criticism
the
writer
of
this
history
equally
skilled
in
literature
and
innocent
of
philosophy
has
thought
it
possible
to
exclude
æsthetic
science
in
the
strict
sense
the
more
transcendental
æsthetic
those
ambitious
theories
of
beauty
and
artistic
pleasure
in
general
which
seem
so
noble
and
fascinating
until
we
discover
them
to
be
but
of
juno

to
limit
his
treatise

lofty
rhetoric
and
poetic
to
the
theory
and

criticism

taste

ch
i
thus
is
produced
a
book
instructive
in
many
ways
but
wholly
deficient
in
method
and
definite
object
what
is
lofty
rhetoric
and
poetic
the
theory
of
criticism
and
literary
taste
if
not
æsthetic
pure
and
simple
how
can
the
history
of
these
be
composed
without
due
notice
of
metaphysical
æsthetic
and
other
manifestations
whose
interaction
and
development
are
the
fabric
of
history
itself
perhaps
saintsbury
hoped
to
be
able
to
write
a
history
of
criticism
as
distinct
from
that
of
æsthetic
if
that
be
the
case
he
has
been
unsuccessful
in
writing
