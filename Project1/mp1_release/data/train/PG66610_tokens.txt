preface
this
book
is
an
attempt
to
follow
the
track
of
personal
influence
across
society
the
first
three
chapters
are
taken
up
with
discussions
of
political
reform
the
fourth
chapter
with
contemporary
journalism
the
results
of
these
discussions
are
then
summarized
in
the
chapters
called
i
know
that
there
are
as
many
ways
of
stating
the
main
idea
of
the
book
as
there
are
minds
in
the
world
that
idea
is
that
we
can
always
do
more
for
mankind
by
following
the
good
in
a
straight
line
than
we
can
by
making
concessions
to
evil
the
illusion
that
it
is
wise
or
necessary
to
suppress
our
instinctive
love
of
truth
comes
from
an
imperfect
understanding
of
what
that
instinctive
love
of
truth
represents
and
of
what
damage
happens
both
to
ourselves
and
to
others
when
we
suppress
it
the
more
closely
we
look
at
the
facts
the
more
serious
does
this
damage
appear
and
on
the
other
hand
the
more
closely
we
look
at
the
facts
the
more
trifling
inconsequent
and
absurd
do
all
those
reasons
appear
which
strive
to
make
us
accept
and
thereby
sanctify
and
preserve
some
portion
of
the
conceded
evil
in
the
world

practical
agitation
i
election
time
it
is
the
ambition
of
the
agitator
to
use
the
machinery
of
government
to
make
men
more
unselfish
in
so
far
as
he
succeeds
in
this
he
is
creating
a
living
church
the
only
sort
of
state
church
that
would
be
entirely
at
one
with
our
system
because
it
would
be
merely
a
representation
in
the
formal
government
of
a
spirit
abroad
among
the
people
campaign
platforms
are
merely
creeds
believe
in
civil
service
is
a
way
of
saying
do
not
believe
in
theft
and
the
phrase
was
a
fragmentary
and
incomplete
formulation
of
the
greater
truth
it
was
the
sign
that
a
movement
was
beginning
among
the
people
due
to
reawakening
instinct
reawakening
sensibility
it
was
the
forerunner
of
all
those
changes
for
the
better
that
have
been
spreading
over
our
administrative
government
during
the
last
thirty
years
a
quiet
revolution
has
been
going
forward
under
our
eyes
recorded
step
by
step
it
is
only
because
our
standards
have
been
going
up
faster
than
the
reforms
came
in
that
we
believe
the
evils
are
growing
worse
such
changes
go
on
all
the
time
all
over
the
world
but
the
value
and
rarity
of
this
one
come
from
its
unity
and
coherence
such
a
thing
might
happen
in
germany
or
in
england
but
you
could
not
disentangle
the
forces
thirty
years
ago
politics
was
thought
to
be
no
occupation
for
a
gentleman
it
was
a
matter
of
rolls
of
dirty
bills
you
had
as
little
to
do
with
it
as
possible
you
voted
your
party
ticket
you
paid
your
taxes
you
bribed
the
ashman
and
the
policeman
at
your
uptown
house
and
the
clerk
of
the
court
the
inspector
the
agent
and
the
commissioner
of
jurors
at
your
office
that
subtle
change
of
attitude
in
the
citizen
towards
his
public
duty
which
is
now
in
progress
has
in
it
something
of
the
religious
the
whole
matter
becomes
comprehensible
the
moment
we
cease
to
think
of
it
as
politics
and
see
in
it
a
widespread
and
perfectly
natural
reaction
against
an
era
of
wickedness
had
our
framework
of
government
afforded
no
outlet
to
the
force
had
our
ills
been
irremediably
crystallized
into
formal
tyranny
we
should
perhaps
have
witnessed
great
revivalist
upheavals
sacraments
saints
prophets
prostrations
and
adoration
as
it
is
we
have
seen
deadly
pamphlets
schedules
enactments
documents
which
it
required
our
whole
attention
and
our
whole
time
to
understand
and
behind
each
of
them
a
remorseless
interrogator
with
a
white
cravat
and
a
face
of
iron
what
motive
drives
them
on
what
oil
fills
their
lamps
who
feeds
them
these
horrid
things
they
bring
these
instruments
forged
by
unremitting
toil
technical
insufferable
they
are
the
cure
with
such
levers
and
with
them
only
can
the
stones
be
lifted
off
the
hearts
of
men
they
are
the
alternatives
of
revolution
may
have
a
thousand
meanings
and
be
used
to
cover
a
thousand
projects
of
doubtful
utility
but
with
us
it
has
a
definite
meaning
when
the
foreigner
says
but
is
your
reform
the
right
remedy
he
thinks
it
is
a
question
of
policy
or
of
the
incidence
of
a
tax
he
supposes
there
is
an
intellectual
question
but
with
us
the
problem
is
how
to
protect
an
attorney
against
a
dishonest
judge
how
to
stop
the
sheriff
from
stealing
a
fund
pending
the
litigation
what
we
want
to
do
what
we
are
doing
is
to
get
rid
of
gross
malpractices
gross
theft
gross
abuse
of
public
trust
it
is
waste
of
time
to
expend
learned
argument
on
a
judge
who
has
been
bought
the
litigants
must
join
forces
and
get
rid
of
that
judge
before
they
can
talk
of
course
we
know
that
the
real
trouble
with
our
politics
is
that
these
attorneys
have
themselves
bribed
the
judge
and
share
in
the
division
of
their
property
it
is
to
questions
of
this
kind
that
the
conscience
of
the
country
has
been
drawn
there
is
nothing
peculiarly
sacred
about
politics
but
the
history
of
reform
movements
during
the
last
few
years
furnishes
such
striking
and
wonderful
illustrations
of
human
nature
that
it
is
worth
study
a
few
men
have
a
desire
a
hope
of
improving
some
evil
they
stagger
towards
it
and
fall
the
impulse
is
always
good
the
mistakes
made
are
progressive
they
record
the
past
they
outline
the
future
if
you
draw
an
arrow
through
them
it
will
point
north
if
you
arrange
the
reform
movements
against
tammany
hall
in
a
series
and
consider
them
minutely
you
will
find
that
the
earlier
ones
are
comparatively
corrupt
sporadic
disorganized
ignorant
and
shortsighted
in
purpose
they
have
steadily
become
more
honest
more
frequent
more
coherent
more
intelligent
and
ambitious
if
you
examine
any
one
of
them
it
would
be
impossible
to
misplace
it
in
the
series
looking
more
closely
you
see
the
reason
the
earlier
the
movement
the
more
zealously
do
its
leaders
imitate
the
methods
of
current
politics
each
movement
represents
the
philosophy
of
its
era
we
have
had
the
frankly
corrupt
era
fighting
the
devil
with
fire
the
compromise
era
buying
reform
the
educational
era
which
began
two
years
ago
after
low
was
defeated
when
people
said
they
were
glad
of
the
movement
in
spite
of
the
defeat
note
this
that
low
did
not
lead
a
lost
cause
nor
was
any
belief
in
lost
causes
at
the
bottom
of
his
movement
but
in
making
the
best
of
his
defeat
many
minds
stumbled
into
philosophy
and
this
illustrates
the
progress
of
an
idea
people
will
accept
it
as
an
explanation
of
the
past
before
they
will
take
it
as
a
guide
to
the
future
it
glimmers
before
them
at
a
moment
when
they
need
comfort
and
vanishes
in
the
light
of
a
comfortable
habit
or
prejudice
this
apparition
of
the
educational
idea
flitted
across
new
york
and
took
root
in
many
minds
now
the
smoky
torch
of
reform
has
passed
from
hand
to
hand
and
is
beginning
to
burn
brighter
how
could
the
original
darkness
give
forth
more
than
a
gleam
all
progress
is
experimental
the
architects
discovered
by
practice
that
the
arch
would
support
itself
their
earlier
efforts
were
tentative
you
can
see
what
notion
they
had
in
mind
as
they
very
gradually
learned
how
to
subserve
the
laws
of
gravity
and
tension
each
improvement
is
qualified
by
its
limitations
but
shows
a
gain
as
toward
the
immediate
past
you
are
following
the
steps
of
the
groping
and
fumbling
mind
of
man
fettered
at
every
point
by
his
own
conceptions
moving
each
time
towards
a
bolder
generalization
each
stride
forward
exactly
proportionate
to
the
breadth
of
thought
on
which
it
is
calculated
what
other
method
is
there
the
men
who
fought
the
tweed
ring
did
what
passed
for
in
their
day
must
be
paid
for
of
course
but
let
the
people
vote
the
philosophy
of
the
strong
movement
in
showed
an
advance
plunder
must
be
divided
of
course
but
let
have
it
because
we
are
the
low
movement
in
appealed
to
voters
on
the
ground
of
labor
had
to
be
conciliated
local
politicians
of
the
worst
sort
subsidized
was
spent
of
it
in
ways
that
did
more
harm
than
good
but
the
methods
were
delicate
the
battle
of
the
standards
goes
forward
ceaselessly
but
all
standards
are
going
up
what
the
reformer
calls
the
idealist
calls
chicanery
what
the
idealist
calls
politics
the
reformer
calls
utopia
but
in
they
are
discussing
whether
or
not
the
reformers
shall
falsify
the
returns
in
they
are
discussing
whether
or
not
they
shall
expose
fraud
in
their
own
camp
the
men
engaged
in
all
these
struggles
are
in
perfect
ignorance
that
they
are
really
leading
a
religious
reaction
they
think
that
since
they
are
in
politics
the
doctrines
of
compromise
apply
they
are
drawn
into
politics
by
conscience
but
once
there
they
have
only
their
business
training
to
guide
them
a
training
in
the
art
of
subserving
material
interests
now
if
a
piece
of
your
land
has
an
uncertain
boundary
you
have
a
right
to
compromise
on
any
theory
you
like
because
you
own
the
land
but
if
you
start
out
with
the
sole
and
avowed
purpose
of
upholding
honesty
in
politics
and
you
uphold
anything
else
or
subserve
any
other
interest
whatever
you
are
a
deceiver
when
you
began
you
did
not
say
stand
for
a
readjustment
of
political
interests
there
will
be
a
continuation
of
many
abuses
under
my
administration
to
be
sure
but
i
hope
they
will
not
be
quite
so
bad
as
heretofore
i
shall
not
insist
on
the
absolutely
unselfish
conduct
of
my
office
it
is
not
if
you
had
said
this
you
might
have
got
the
friendly
support
of
a
few
doctrinaires
but
you
would
never
have
got
the
support
and
approval
of
the
great
public
you
would
not
have
been
elected
and
therefore
you
did
not
say
it
on
the
contrary
what
our
reformers
do
is
this
they
begin
before
election
by
promising
an
absolutely
pure
administration
they
make
proclamations
of
a
new
era
and
after
they
have
secured
a
certain
following
they
proceed
to
chaffer
over
how
much
honesty
they
will
demand
and
how
much
take
as
if
they
were
rescuing
property
these
men
are
then
in
their
desires
a
part
of
the
future
and
in
their
practices
of
the
past
their
desires
move
society
forward
their
practices
set
it
back
and
so
we
have
moved
forward
by
jolts
until
like
a
people
emerging
from
the
deep
sea
the
water
looks
clearer
above
our
heads
and
we
can
almost
see
the
sky
every
advance
has
cost
great
effort
it
took
as
much
courage
for
a
mugwump
to
renounce
his
party
allegiance
in
as
it
does
now
for
a
man
to
denounce
both
national
parties
as
dens
of
thieves
it
took
as
much
hard
thinking
some
years
ago
for
the
leaders
of
the
reform
democrats
to
cut
loose
from
tammany
hall
as
it
does
now
for
the
independent
to
see
that
there
is
in
all
our
politics
only
one
machine
held
together
by
all
the
bosses
and
their
heelers
and
that
the
whole
thing
must
be
attacked
at
once
how
gradual
has
been
the
process
of
emancipation
from
intellectual
bondage
how
inevitably
people
are
limited
by
the
terms
in
which
they
think
a
generation
of
men
has
been
consumed
by
the
shibboleth
within
the
party
a
generation
of
educated
and
men
who
accomplished
in
their
day
much
good
and
left
the
country
better
than
they
found
it
but
are
floating
like
hulks
in
the
trough
of
the
sea
of
politics
because
all
their
mind
and
all
their
energy
were
exhausted
in
discovering
certain
superficial
evils
and
in
fighting
them
their
analysis
of
political
elements
left
the
deeper
causes
mysterious
they
did
not
see
mere
human
nature
they
still
treated
republicanism
and
democracy
empty
superstitions
as
ideas
and
they
handled
with
reverence
the
bones
of
bogus
saints
and
the
whole
apparatus
of
by
which
they
had
been
governed
and
yet
it
is
owing
to
the
activity
of
these
men
that
the
deeper
political
conditions
became
visible
men
can
not
transcend
their
own
analysis
and
see
themselves
under
the
microscope
the
work
we
do
transforms
us
into
social
factors
we
are
a
part
of
the
changes
we
bring
in
before
we
know
it
we
ourselves
are
the
problem
the
mugwumps
revolt
and
defeat
blaine
they
strengthen
the
democratic
party
they
again
revolt
and
defeat
bryan
and
strengthen
the
republican
party
so
in
the
little
towns
all
over
the
country
on
local
issues
the
democrats
are
put
out
for
being
dishonest
or
the
republicans
are
put
out
for
being
dishonest
through
this
process
the
younger
generation
has
been
led
to
note
one
fact
both
parties
are
dishonest
but
says
the
parent
am
a
good
democrat
my
party
is
not
dishonest
all
the
time
it
needs
it
is
too
late
the
young
man
hates
both
parties
equally
he
now
looks
at
his
father
and
sees
in
him
a
sample
of
corrupted
intelligence
a
man
able
to
repeat
meaningless
phrases
and
he
draws
hope
from
the
conclusion
it
was
natural
that
the
father
should
have
been
all
his
life
because
he
could
be
whistled
back
to
support
iniquity
by
an
appeal
to
party
loyalty
he
belonged
to
a
race
that
had
lost
the
power
of
political
initiative
they
could
not
act
alone
they
must
daub
themselves
with
party
names
or
they
would
catch
cold
they
had
not
the
stomach
to
be
merely
men
thirty
years
ago
of
society
thought
that
every
democrat
was
a
rebel
and
a
scoundrel
the
world
to
that
society
was
composed
of
two
classes
republicans
righteous
men
democrats
villains
twenty
years
of
an
almost
steady
growth
in
the
power
of
or
of
what
the
germans
would
call
civic
consciousness
has
barely
sufficed
to
strike
off
the
adjectives
but
it
has
left
mankind
still
divided
as
before
meanwhile
there
has
emerged
a
group
of
men
who
see
the
whole
problem
in
a
much
simpler
light
these
men
have
carried
forward
the
analysis
which
their
fathers
or
let
us
say
their
elder
brothers
had
begun
to
such
a
point
that
there
are
no
words
in
it
which
are
meaningless
no
factors
which
are
not
reduced
to
terms
of
human
nature
they
did
nothing
but
add
the
last
link
to
a
chain
of
logic
their
predecessors
discovered
the
machine
and
spent
their
lives
in
trying
to
belong
to
a
party
without
strengthening
its
machine
these
latter
men
discovered
that
both
parties
were
ruled
by
the
same
machine
they
see
one
issue
and
only
one
issue
in
american
politics
namely
the
attack
on
that
machine
moreover
these
men
have
political
initiative
that
is
to
say
they
contemplate
creating
conditions
and
not
merely
making
transient
use
of
visible
conditions
their
idea
is
so
simple
that
any
one
whose
mind
is
not
warped
by
the
cant
of
party
politics
understands
it
at
once
this
political
corruption
is
a
unity
vote
against
it
and
you
will
beat
it
vote
for
any
part
of
it
and
you
strengthen
this
sounds
simple
but
in
practice
the
prejudices
the
interests
the
passions
and
political
temperament
of
the
whole
population
are
against
it
every
argument
that
the
people
understand
is
against
this
course
everything
that
either
party
fears
or
hates
in
the
other
party
is
passionately
pointed
out
as
a
reason
against
independent
voting
according
to
republicans
independent
voting
involves
croker
to
extend
his
rule
over
the
entire
state
and
tammany
hall
to
control
the
judiciary
and
the
cause
of
sound
according
to
democrats
it
involves
the
encouraging
of
trusts
tariffs
pensions
expansion
and
foreign
conquest
according
to
both
democrats
and
republicans
independent
voting
is
in
the
air
and
is
at
odds
with
the
spirit
of
our
institutions
which
contemplate
two
parties
and
no
more
and
finally
every
one
condemns
the
independent
because
he
violates
that
thumb
rule
which
slovenly
thinkers
regard
as
a
summary
of
all
political
philosophy
two
evils
choose
the
now
the
answer
to
all
these
arguments
is
that
they
are
the
merest
mirage
it
makes
no
difference
which
of
the
two
evils
platt
or
croker
has
the
name
of
ruling
the
state
at
present
they
divide
the
rule
between
them
they
can
do
no
more
there
is
no
argument
that
can
be
used
against
tammany
hall
which
is
powerful
enough
to
make
the
republican
ring
trustworthy
there
is
no
argument
against
expansion
so
excessively
convincing
that
it
changes
the
moral
character
of
the
democratic
party
these
learned
arguments
are
useless
ludicrous
pathetic
irrational
impotent
contemptible
they
do
but
distract
us
from
the
real
issue
which
is
personal
corruption
where
shall
a
man
cast
his
vote
against
it
if
i
turn
out
mckinley
because
he
bleeds
the
natives
i
put
in
a
democrat
to
bleed
the
natives
if
the
whitewashing
of
alger
arouses
public
indignation
tammany
hall
feeds
at
the
trough
if
control
of
the
judiciary
arouses
popular
indignation
pigs
feed
at
the
trough
as
for
sound
money
we
have
already
elected
one
congress
on
the
issue
in
just
as
in
we
elected
a
congress
on
the
tariff
issue
what
was
done
why
in
each
case
that
was
done
which
the
ring
wanted
done
nothing
which
national
party
stands
for
an
idea
the
only
shadow
of
reason
for
believing
that
either
does
is
that
the
republicans
cried
sound
money
and
won
they
have
done
nothing
had
bryan
won
he
would
have
done
nothing
could
have
done
nothing
there
are
no
issues
in
american
politics
save
this
one
issue
of
common
honesty
you
can
not
throw
an
issue
into
this
whirlpool
of
vice
for
your
issue
turns
to
cash
by
the
contact
we
need
not
waste
our
time
reading
the
platforms
drawn
by
platt
and
croker
we
must
not
vote
for
any
man
who
does
not
go
into
public
life
as
their
enemy
because
we
know
that
in
so
far
as
he
is
not
their
enemy
he
is
ours
as
for
these
dreadful
consequences
that
are
always
about
to
follow
from
a
refusal
to
support
one
end
of
the
iniquity
they
do
not
follow
we
have
the
evils
now
we
are
at
the
worst
the
powers
of
darkness
may
conspire
and
heap
all
in
ruins
but
they
must
not
prevent
us
from
beginning
upon
a
constructive
line
to
draw
together
and
build
up
the
powers
of
light
nor
is
there
the
smallest
distinction
either
in
the
evil
or
its
cure
between
the
case
of
a
village
of
a
state
or
of
the
whole
nation
say
you
live
in
a
town
you
can
only
get
a
clean
by
running
men
against
both
the
regular
parties
there
is
no
other
way
of
getting
rid
of
hanna
and
the
presidential
syndicate
than
by
running
an
independent
candidate
for
the
presidency
no
form
of
bryanism
will
oust
it
no
rump
democracy
nor
any
kind
of
democracy
democracy
is
finished
republicanism
is
finished
this
is
the
zero
point
of
party
loyalty
it
has
been
reached
very
slowly
it
means
open
war
the
citizen
is
now
confronted
with
a
third
ticket
which
is
a
deliberate
insult
to
both
the
others
no
matter
what
the
conditions
it
is
an
appeal
which
disintegrates
the
emotions
of
the
voter
this
is
the
very
elixir
of
reform
people
are
forced
to
think
it
hurts
them
they
cry
out
against
those
who
create
the
dilemma
but
they
can
not
escape
it
the
vote
you
poll
will
vary
if
the
party
are
intense
and
the
party
candidates
promise
fairly
very
few
men
will
see
the
point
of
your
movement
but
no
one
escapes
its
influence
let
us
say
that
five
thousand
vote
your
ticket
these
are
the
only
men
whose
response
is
scheduled
but
the
political
vision
of
five
hundred
thousand
has
been
quickened
no
atom
of
this
influence
is
lost
the
work
was
done
when
the
vote
was
cast
even
if
it
be
not
counted
at
all
it
will
show
in
every
political
camp
in
the
near
future
but
do
you
ever
have
outward
success
does
the
time
ever
come
when
the
standards
of
every
one
are
so
high
that
the
parties
themselves
present
candidates
as
good
as
your
own
and
there
is
no
excuse
for
your
existence
that
depends
upon
the
trend
of
the
age
one
thing
only
is
certain
that
by
pursuing
this
course
you
are
doing
all
that
you
can
do
you
are
wasting
no
power
no
part
of
your
force
is
helping
the
enemy
after
all
the
great
discovery
is
a
very
simple
thing
we
have
found
after
many
experiments
that
what
we
really
want
is
not
the
turning
out
of
officials
not
the
enactment
of
laws
but
the
raising
of
the
general
standards
the
way
to
do
this
is
to
set
up
a
standard
of
course
nobody
likes
to
find
a
foot
rule
laid
against
his
shortage
even
the
vocabulary
of
the
average
man
is
attacked
by
such
a
system
words
like
pass
current
like
clipped
coin
in
the
language
of
politics
and
the
keying
up
of
words
to
their
biblical
value
brings
out
one
man
a
thief
and
the
next
a
hypocrite
all
these
civic
commotions
great
and
small
that
surge
up
and
are
scattered
that
form
and
reform
the
leagues
and
unions
are
the
altruism
of
the
community
fighting
its
way
to
the
surface
through
the
obstructions
the
snares
and
the
oppressions
of
the
organized
world
no
discouragement
sets
it
back
no
betrayal
destroys
it
the
people
come
forward
with
ever
new
faith
what
ceaseless
endeavor
what
patient
trial
of
various
forms
of
organization
we
live
in
a
society
where
egoism
is
so
thoroughly
organized
that
there
is
hardly
a
flicker
of
faith
that
can
not
be
made
to
heat
the
pot
the
dragon
stands
ready
to
eat
up
the
child
as
soon
as
it
shall
be
born
you
can
not
hitch
your
horse
to
anything
without
helping
drag
the
juggernaut
before
you
know
it
virtue
is
pocketed
take
the
most
obvious
case
the
reformers
imagine
they
are
in
politics
and
must
win
at
all
costs
one
enthusiast
calls
twenty
friends
into
a
room
and
organizes
a
club
and
the
club
ties
his
hands
and
sells
out
to
the
nearest
bidder
before
he
knows
it
he
has
been
organized
back
into
tammany
hall
you
begin
with
a
call
to
arms
and
a
plan
of
organization
the
men
come
to
you
in
a
moment
of
hope
showing
every
shade
of
intelligence
every
stage
of
opinion
one
because
he
believes
in
your
candidate
one
because
he
hates
tammany
hall
one
because
he
wants
prominence
all
because
they
do
not
expect
to
be
alone
the
men
who
volunteer
have
not
a
clear
notion
of
what
they
are
in
for
they
thought
it
was
a
movement
to
clean
the
streets
in
the
course
of
their
campaign
it
develops
into
an
attack
on
a
bank
they
thought
it
was
a
town
movement
some
stage
of
it
affects
national
politics
they
thought
it
was
a
roosevelt
movement
it
turns
out
to
involve
hostility
to
roosevelt
your
muster
shows
the
vague
hope
of
a
lot
of
men
who
are
utterly
incompetent
undisciplined
ignorant
they
are
merchants
lawyers
doctors
professors
clergymen
the
respectability
and
intelligence
of
the
town
and
so
far
as
goes
they
are
the
tattered
children
of
tyranny
good
god
what
an
army
at
the
first
trumpet
they
scatter
one
sells
out
one
recants
one
disappears
they
are
anywhere
and
nowhere
a
ship
of
fools
a
barnyard
the
execution
of
the
one
idea
for
which
they
were
brought
together
has
scattered
them
like
sheep
let
us
take
another
case
you
think
that
what
is
needed
is
to
raise
a
standard
you
call
your
twenty
friends
about
you
they
are
not
corrupt
nevertheless
let
us
see
who
they
will
be
we
are
not
dealing
with
an
imaginary
community
but
with
american
citizens
as
they
exist
with
men
every
one
of
whom
trusts
his
instincts
to
a
different
extent
each
man
believes
in
principle
in
the
abstract
but
thinks
it
is
sometimes
hopeless
to
be
severely
virtuous
in
politics
this
is
the
it
the
time
is
this
the
year
can
you
do
it
this
way
now
of
course
it
is
always
the
year
it
is
never
hopeless
absolute
honesty
is
always
the
way
but
an
age
of
corruption
destroys
faith
this
is
the
essential
injury
this
is
the
disease
you
yourself
have
a
little
stronger
belief
a
little
more
political
enterprise
than
your
twenty
friends
otherwise
it
would
be
they
who
were
summoning
you
to
a
conference
it
is
certain
that
their
joint
wisdom
will
result
in
action
less
radical
than
you
believe
in
they
outvote
you
in
council
the
standard
they
set
up
is
not
absolute
but
this
outcome
will
prevent
you
from
making
your
point
at
all
if
you
are
to
back
your
friends
up
publicly
and
are
honest
yourself
all
you
can
say
will
be
a
now
the
public
instinct
understands
this
very
well
already
ten
per
cent
of
your
own
faith
you
have
compromised
it
has
cost
you
ninety
per
cent
of
your
educational
power
for
the
heart
of
man
will
respond
only
to
a
true
thing
what
is
it
that
has
led
you
to
compromise
why
the
age
you
live
in
you
yourself
being
afraid
to
stand
alone
have
dipped
your
flag
with
the
best
intentions
because
you
can
not
see
that
any
other
course
is
practicable
yet
you
yourself
can
keep
your
own
intellectual
integrity
only
at
the
price
of
destroying
your
own
handiwork
if
you
do
not
destroy
it
you
are
a
hypocrite
here
in
the
room
with
you
were
twenty
men
the
very
flower
of
the
idealism
of
the
town
not
chosen
by
accident
but
coming
together
by
natural
selection
twenty
more
like
them
do
not
exist
in
the
community
for
their
activity
would
have
revealed
them
and
yet
there
was
not
found
faith
enough
among
these
to
set
up
an
absolute
standard
nay
they
hang
on
your
arms
and
prevent
you
from
raising
one
if
you
are
to
do
it
you
must
do
it
alone
then
these
men
will
be
the
first
to
denounce
you
for
your
act
damns
them
you
can
only
be
true
to
the
public
conscience
by
rebuking
your
friends
if
you
fail
to
do
this
your
banner
is
submerged
let
us
consider
the
cause
of
this
weakness
in
reform
organizations
you
wish
to
appeal
to
the
people
with
as
good
a
show
of
names
as
you
can
and
so
you
get
a
lot
of
men
to
indorse
you
this
is
considered
practical
let
us
see
if
it
is
we
are
fighting
tammany
hall
but
no
one
will
for
an
instant
admit
that
every
tammany
man
is
dishonest
the
corruption
we
started
out
to
correct
was
a
corruption
of
the
intelligence
a
bad
habit
a
defect
of
vision
the
same
defect
keeps
republicans
in
line
for
platt
because
he
is
the
party
a
recognized
agent
of
the
community
the
same
defect
prevents
a
just
man
from
joining
a
new
movement
unless
banker
jones
is
leading
it
the
habit
of
the
community
is
to
rely
on
some
one
else
to
govern
them
no
man
trusts
himself
the
machine
upon
analysis
turns
out
to
be
a
lack
of
wherever
you
see
a
man
who
gives
some
one
corruption
some
one
prejudice
as
a
reason
for
not
taking
action
himself
you
see
a
cog
in
the
machine
that
governs
us
the
proof
of
it
is
that
he
will
dissuade
you
from
striking
the
iniquity
he
will
explain
that
you
try
it
without
doing
more
harm
than
good
you
will
find
that
at
every
point
of
defence
from
the
arguments
of
croker
himself
to
the
arguments
of
some
sainted
college
president
the
reasons
given
are
identical
i
can
not
find
any
one
who
defends
stealing
they
only
deprecate
action
as
being
inexpedient
now
then
if
i
ask
a
voter
to
join
my
organization
and
use
as
a
bait
an
appeal
to
this
very
weakness
his
reliance
upon
other
opinion
can
i
hope
to
make
much
headway
i
am
taking
in
just
so
much
of
tammany
hall
my
whole
body
becomes
an
adjunct
of
tammany
in
the
same
sense
that
machine
is
an
adjunct
i
am
last
outpost
i
stand
there
calling
myself
reform
and
yet
i
do
not
act
some
one
else
must
now
come
forward
and
try
his
hand
this
process
of
ebullition
and
thereupon
stagnation
has
happened
again
and
again
i
suppose
there
are
a
dozen
extant
wrecks
of
reform
political
organizations
in
the
city
many
people
have
despaired
altogether
they
think
it
is
a
law
of
god
that
political
organizations
become
corrupt
in
the
second
year
the
experience
is
entirely
due
to
the
persistent
putting
of
new
wine
into
old
bottles
in
their
names
and
hopes
these
bodies
have
stood
for
purity
but
in
their
membership
they
have
even
in
their
inception
stood
for
prejudice
then
too
the
bottles
bore
good
labels
and
bad
wine
was
soon
poured
into
them
a
political
organization
is
a
transferable
commodity
you
could
not
find
a
better
way
of
killing
virtue
than
by
packing
it
into
one
of
these
contraptions
which
some
gang
of
thieves
is
sure
to
find
useful
the
short
lesson
that
comes
out
of
long
experience
in
political
agitation
is
something
like
this
the
motive
power
in
all
of
these
movements
is
the
instinct
of
religious
feeling
all
the
obstruction
comes
from
attempting
to
rely
on
anything
else
conciliation
is
the
enemy
it
is
just
as
impossible
to
help
reform
by
conciliating
prejudice
as
it
is
by
buying
votes
prejudice
is
the
enemy
whoever
is
not
for
you
is
against
you
what
then
must
the
enthusiast
do
in
the
way
of
organization
let
him
go
ahead
and
do
some
particular
thing
and
ask
the
public
to
help
him
do
it
he
will
thus
get
behind
him
whatever
force
exists
at
that
especial
time
for
that
especial
purpose
it
may
not
be
much
but
no
amount
of
letterheads
and
great
seals
will
increase
it
let
him
abandon
written
constitutions
let
him
not
be
bound
by
a
vote
nor
seek
to
bind
others
by
a
vote
if
you
have
formal
procedure
you
are
tied
up
for
you
will
then
have
to
convert
six
tailors
into
apostles
before
you
can
get
at
the
public
content
yourself
more
modestly
see
a
friend
or
two
and
tell
them
what
you
intend
to
do
if
they
help
you
do
it
alone
do
not
think
you
are
wasting
your
time
even
if
no
one
joins
you
the
prejudice
against
the
individual
is
part
of
the
evil
you
are
fighting
if
you
keep
on
in
a
consistent
line
of
action
people
will
come
to
you
one
by
one
and
your
group
will
grow
into
a
sort
of
centre
of
influence
there
will
result
a
unity
of
method
as
well
as
of
aim
which
as
your
purposes
become
understood
will
enable
you
to
act
with
the
speed
of
thought
and
the
force
of
an
avalanche
one
great
merit
of
this
method
will
be
that
your
whole
policy
will
remain
an
enigma
to
every
one
except
those
who
really
want
what
you
want
namely
to
raise
the
general
standards
only
such
men
will
seek
you
out
any
one
else
is
a
danger
thus
your
organization
will
grow
slowly
but
will
remain
uncapturable
an
influence
a
menace
a
standard
as
fast
as
adherents
appear
you
can
set
up
centre
after
centre
of
enlightenment
preparatory
to
your
campaigns
debates
pamphlets
correspondence
the
battery
of
agitation
and
in
the
mean
time
the
benefit
done
to
the
workers
themselves
is
worth
all
the
pains
by
adopting
formal
machinery
you
would
not
only
organize
the
wrong
people
in
but
you
would
organize
the
right
people
out
new
york
city
is
full
of
men
whose
passion
for
educating
can
find
no
vent
in
politics
because
politics
are
corrupt
and
who
run
civic
leagues
lyceums
and
institutes
they
are
at
work
in
your
cause
although
they
call
it
by
different
names
all
this
zeal
is
at
your
disposal
if
you
will
only
leave
your
office
doors
open
and
do
something
to
deserve
its
support
do
not
adopt
a
scheme
that
excludes
these
men
you
can
not
impress
them
into
your
army
but
you
do
not
need
to
impress
them
only
to
know
them
personally
you
can
not
make
them
district
captains
but
they
are
district
captains
already
you
say
not
the
votes
of
your
twenty
friends
as
valuable
as
your
own
whence
this
egoism
it
is
not
egoism
i
am
ready
to
follow
any
one
who
wants
to
do
this
particular
thing
that
is
make
an
appeal
to
absolute
unselfishness
at
no
point
to
conciliate
any
one
this
is
anarchy
every
man
his
own
on
the
contrary
it
is
consolidation
for
should
two
men
arise
proposing
this
course
they
would
coalesce
at
once
you
say
is
to
do
all
the
work
how
are
you
to
get
men
to
come
forward
unless
you
give
them
tangible
formulated
doctrines
papers
to
sign
and
words
to
mumble
the
answer
is
that
the
men
who
do
the
work
in
reform
campaigns
do
not
need
these
things
literature
and
doctrines
you
will
undoubtedly
produce
it
is
not
necessary
for
the
effective
distribution
of
them
that
you
should
adopt
the
parade
of
american
party
discipline
organization
and
a
distribution
of
labor
you
must
develop
but
you
must
not
have
them
on
paper
faster
than
they
exist
in
reality
you
say
is
not
representative
government
where
are
your
convention
your
argument
your
vote
your
majority
your
loyalty
our
people
must
have
these
the
answer
is
that
in
spite
of
their
views
on
representative
government
our
people
still
remain
human
beings
as
fast
as
they
find
themselves
spiritually
represented
by
some
person
or
body
they
follow
that
influence
it
is
representative
government
but
it
represents
only
the
positive
and
aspiring
part
of
the
community
the
part
which
never
gets
represented
under
your
system
because
that
system
insists
upon
alloying
it
with
other
elements
and
ruining
its
power
it
is
educational
activity
in
the
purest
form
by
what
other
means
can
you
speak
to
the
whole
people
at
once
in
the
language
of
action
by
what
other
means
can
you
reach
the
conscience
of
the
unknown
man
who
has
not
touched
politics
for
twenty
years
because
he
could
take
no
part
in
it
because
he
did
not
understand
it
the
disfranchised
scattered
and
dumb
men
on
whose
voice
the
future
waits
consider
what
you
are
trying
to
do
a
party
under
control
of
a
machine
is
held
together
by
an
appeal
to
its
caucuses
affiliations
resources
methods
are
constructed
on
that
principle
your
body
whose
aim
is
to
increase
the
unselfishness
and
intellect
of
your
must
be
held
together
at
every
point
by
if
the
reform
body
shall
blindly
do
just
the
opposite
of
what
a
party
does
it
will
pursue
practical
politics
the
regular
party
is
in
theory
representative
of
enrolled
voters
you
represent
the
sentiment
of
undiscovered
people
the
party
appeals
to
old
forces
and
extant
conditions
you
appeal
to
new
feelings
and
new
voters
the
party
offers
a
gift
to
every
adherent
you
must
offer
him
nothing
but
labor
that
is
your
protection
against
traitors
the
party
accords
every
man
the
weight
of
his
vote
in
its
counsels
you
must
give
him
nothing
but
the
influence
of
his
mind
you
shout
is
not
politics
you
can
never
hold
men
together
without
the
fact
is
otherwise
there
is
some
force
at
work
in
this
town
which
year
after
year
brings
forward
groups
of
men
who
proclaim
a
new
dispensation
they
are
in
so
far
as
they
have
any
cohesion
held
together
without
bonds
now
all
formal
bonds
will
chain
them
to
the
past
for
electrical
force
you
must
adopt
electrical
machinery
for
moral
force
moral
bonds
all
this
political
system
is
the
harness
for
the
wrong
passion
every
scrap
of
it
imprisons
your
power
the
average
american
citizen
is
slow
to
see
that
you
can
exercise
political
influence
without
the
current
machinery
this
is
a
part
of
the
machine
in
his
brain
he
can
not
see
the
operation
of
law
by
which
virtue
always
tells
but
his
ignorance
does
not
affect
the
operation
of
that
law
even
upon
himself
this
elaborate
analysis
of
just
how
the
force
of
feeling
in
yourself
can
best
be
used
politically
is
after
all
only
an
instance
of
a
general
law
the
shortest
path
between
two
points
always
turns
out
to
be
a
straight
line
people
who
believe
in
the
complexity
of
life
and
have
theories
about
crooked
lines
want
something
else
beside
moral
influence
they
want
influence
through
office
or
influence
toward
special
ends
or
influence
with
particular
persons
you
see
you
are
destroying
your
influence
they
cry
while
every
stroke
is
telling
thinks
you
are
a
praise
god
has
withdrawn
his
i
had
not
hoped
for
this
so
soon
he
has
joined
you
misstate
the
case
he
was
always
with
platt
but
now
he
has
revealed
it
these
refractory
molecules
are
breaking
up
see
the
lines
of
force
begin
to
show
a
clean
cleavage
ten
thousand
intelligences
now
see
the
man
for
what
he
is
at
what
point
in
the
progress
of
this
movement
will
people
begin
to
see
that
it
is
practical
politics
of
the
most
effective
kind
some
people
see
it
now
the
first
people
to
feel
the
strain
are
the
men
whose
livelihood
depends
on
the
outcome
the
last
illustration
of
this
was
given
in
campaign
against
van
wyck
in
new
york
state
in
this
case
as
generally
happens
the
real
battle
was
fought
in
committee
rooms
before
the
forces
were
in
the
field
it
was
the
struggle
for
position
roosevelt
was
to
be
republican
candidate
for
governor
and
was
sure
of
election
the
fight
came
over
the
minor
offices
our
new
york
form
of
ballot
practically
forces
a
man
to
vote
for
a
ticket
and
half
a
dozen
independents
put
up
a
complete
ticket
with
roosevelt
at
the
head
of
it
their
purpose
was
to
prevent
the
republicans
from
using
military
popularity
to
sweep
into
office
a
lot
of
henchmen
within
ten
days
the
republican
henchmen
all
over
the
state
were
taken
with
convulsions
every
crank
of
the
machine
trembled
it
turned
its
awful
power
upon
roosevelt
and
ordered
him
to
get
off
the
independent
ticket
he
obeyed
and
protected
the
henchmen
the
episode
illustrates
the
practical
power
of
a
few
independents
who
can
act
quickly
the
panic
in
the
republican
camp
was
entirely
justified
if
three
tickets
had
remained
in
the
field
with
roosevelt
at
the
head
of
two
of
them
thousands
of
democrats
and
thousands
of
republicans
would
have
voted
for
the
reform
ticket
the
republican
ticket
would
have
polled
merely
the
machine
republicans
the
rumpus
among
the
republican
heelers
following
so
slight
a
cause
as
the
action
of
five
or
six
citizens
who
took
the
field
with
a
ticket
of
their
own
resembled
the
action
of
a
geyser
when
a
cake
of
soap
is
thrown
into
it
rumbling
followed
by
terrific
vomiting
a
little
practical
discipline
among
the
reformers
is
all
that
is
required
to
make
them
formidable
the
discipline
of
experience
of
acting
together
of
personal
trust
this
is
to
be
acquired
only
in
the
field
of
action
it
is
encouraging
to
find
how
small
a
body
of
men
it
takes
even
at
the
present
moment
to
upset
the
calculations
of
the
politicians
the
force
that
made
the
republicans
afraid
did
not
lie
in
the
parcel
of
men
who
threw
in
the
soap
it
came
from
the
great
public
the
episode
showed
that
the
republicans
were
afraid
to
appeal
to
the
country
they
knew
that
their
cabal
was
almost
as
much
hated
as
tammany
hall
there
is
always
great
difficulty
in
this
world
as
to
who
shall
bell
the
cat
but
conventions
of
mice
do
not
further
the
matter
the
way
to
do
it
is
for
a
parcel
of
mice
to
take
their
political
lives
in
their
hands
and
proceed
to
do
it
the
real
meaning
of
all
these
movements
will
not
be
perceived
till
their
work
has
been
done
as
history
the
cause
and
course
of
them
will
be
so
plain
that
a
word
will
suffice
to
explain
them
in
the
light
of
history
it
will
be
clear
that
the
improvement
in
the
personnel
of
our
public
life
was
due
to
the
demands
of
the
public
expressed
in
movements
we
have
already
reached
a
point
where
neither
party
dares
appeal
to
the
public
as
they
did
ten
years
ago
on
purely
party
grounds
roosevelt
and
van
wyck
both
claimed
to
be
men
superior
to
the
average
partisan
the
advance
of
political
thought
has
already
made
the
dullest
man
perceive
the
machine
within
his
own
party
and
every
day
spreads
the
news
that
there
is
only
a
single
machine
in
all
our
politics
the
destruction
of
this
machine
will
not
be
like
the
destruction
of
the
monasteries
by
henry
but
it
will
consist
in
the
substitution
of
new
timber
for
old
in
the
parties
themselves
any
one
who
looks
for
an
expulsion
of
tammany
hall
like
the
expulsion
of
the
moors
from
spain
will
be
disappointed
there
will
always
be
a
tammany
hall
but
it
will
be
run
by
respectable
men
who
will
look
back
with
wonder
and
disgust
upon
this
period
and
who
will
give
the
public
an
honest
administration
because
the
public
has
demanded
it
ii
between
elections
an
election
is
like
a
flash
of
lightning
at
midnight
you
get
an
instantaneous
photograph
of
what
every
man
is
doing
you
see
his
real
relation
toward
his
government
but
an
election
happens
only
once
a
year
government
goes
on
day
and
night
it
is
hard
breaking
down
the
popular
fallacy
that
there
is
such
a
thing
as
governed
by
peculiar
conditions
which
must
be
understood
and
respected
that
the
whole
thing
is
a
mystic
avocation
run
as
a
trade
by
high
priests
and
low
priests
and
is
remote
from
our
daily
life
our
system
of
party
government
has
been
developed
with
the
aim
of
keeping
the
control
in
the
hands
of
professionals
technicalities
have
been
multiplied
and
the
rules
of
the
game
have
become
more
and
more
complex
there
exists
consequently
an
unformulated
belief
that
the
corruption
of
politics
is
something
by
itself
yet
there
probably
never
was
a
civilization
where
the
mesh
of
all
powers
and
interests
was
so
close
it
is
like
the
interlocking
of
roots
in
a
swamp
such
density
and
cohesion
were
never
seen
in
any
epoch
such
a
mat
and
tangle
of
personalities
where
every
man
is
tied
up
with
the
fibres
of
every
other
if
you
take
an
axe
or
a
saw
and
cut
a
clean
piece
out
of
it
anywhere
you
will
maim
every
member
of
society
how
idle
then
even
to
think
of
politics
as
a
subject
by
itself
or
of
the
corruptions
of
the
times
as
localized
politics
gives
what
the
chemists
call
a
and
shows
the
ingredients
in
the
average
composition
but
you
must
take
your
mind
off
politics
if
you
want
to
understand
america
you
must
take
up
the
lives
of
individuals
and
follow
them
out
as
they
play
against
each
other
in
counterpoint
as
soon
as
you
do
this
you
will
not
be
able
to
determine
where
politics
begins
and
where
it
stops
it
is
all
politics
it
is
all
social
intercourse
it
is
all
business
any
square
foot
of
this
soil
will
give
you
the
whole
fauna
and
flora
of
the
land
where
will
you
put
in
your
wedge
of
reform
there
is
not
a
cranny
anywhere
the
mass
is
like
crude
copper
ore
that
can
not
be
blasted
it
blows
out
the
charge
we
think
that
political
agitation
must
show
political
results
this
is
like
trying
to
alter
the
shape
of
a
shadow
without
touching
its
object
the
hope
is
not
only
mistaken
it
is
absurd
the
results
to
be
obtained
from
reform
movements
can
not
show
in
the
political
field
till
they
have
passed
through
the
social
world
after
all
what
you
want
is
votes
is
it
not
would
be
so
encouraging
to
see
virtue
win
that
everybody
would
vote
for
you
thereafter
why
you
manage
it
somehow
this
sort
of
talk
is
the
best
record
of
incompetence
which
corruption
has
imprinted
enlighten
this
class
and
you
have
saved
the
republic
why
my
friend
you
are
so
lost
you
are
so
much
a
mere
product
of
tyranny
that
you
do
not
know
what
a
vote
is
true
we
want
votes
but
the
votes
we
want
must
be
cast
spontaneously
we
do
not
want
them
so
badly
as
to
buy
them
a
vote
is
only
important
because
it
is
an
opinion
even
a
dictator
can
not
force
opinions
upon
his
subjects
by
six
months
of
rule
and
yet
the
complaint
is
that
decency
gets
few
votes
after
a
year
of
effort
by
a
handful
of
radicals
who
are
despised
by
the
community
we
only
enter
the
field
of
politics
because
we
can
there
get
a
hearing
the
candidates
in
reform
movements
are
tools
they
are
like
crowbars
that
break
open
the
mind
of
the
age
they
can
not
be
dodged
concealed
or
laughed
away
every
one
is
aroused
from
his
lethargy
by
seeing
a
real
man
walk
on
the
scene
amid
all
the
stage
properties
and
marionettes
of
conventional
politics
fair
the
people
cry
they
do
not
vote
for
him
of
course
but
they
talk
about
the
portent
with
a
vigor
no
mere
doctrine
could
call
forth
and
the
discussion
blossoms
at
a
later
date
into
a
new
public
spirit
a
new
and
genuine
demand
for
better
things
it
is
apparent
that
between
the
initial
political
activity
of
reformers
and
their
ultimate
political
accomplishments
there
must
intervene
the
real
agitation
the
part
that
does
the
work
which
goes
on
in
the
brains
and
souls
of
individual
men
and
which
can
only
be
observed
in
social
life
in
manners
and
conversation
now
let
us
take
up
the
steps
by
which
in
practical
life
the
reaction
is
set
going
enter
the
nearest
coterie
of
radicals
and
listen
to
the
quarrel
reformers
proverbially
disagree
and
sects
mince
themselves
almost
to
with
us
the
quarrel
always
arises
over
the
same
point
we
afford
under
these
particular
circumstances
to
tell
the
exact
truth
i
have
never
known
a
reform
movement
in
which
this
discussion
did
not
rage
from
start
to
finish
nor
have
i
known
one
where
any
other
point
was
involved
you
are
a
committee
the
parties
offer
to
give
you
half
a
loaf
well
and
good
but
this
is
not
their
main
object
they
want
you
to
call
it
a
whole
loaf
they
want
to
dissipate
your
agitation
by
getting
you
to
tell
the
public
that
you
are
satisfied
what
they
hate
is
the
standard
the
war
between
you
and
them
is
a
spiritual
game
of
chess
they
must
get
you
to
say
they
are
right
it
is
their
only
means
of
retaining
their
power
thus
the
apple
of
discord
falls
into
the
reform
camp
half
its
members
take
the
bait
in
new
york
city
our
politics
have
been
so
picturesque
the
pleas
of
the
politician
so
shallow
the
lies
demanded
from
the
reformers
so
obvious
that
the
eternal
principles
of
the
situation
have
been
revealed
in
their
elemental
simplicity
it
is
just
because
the
impulse
towards
better
things
carries
no
material
content
we
do
not
want
any
particular
thing
but
we
want
an
improvement
in
everything
it
is
just
because
the
whole
movement
is
purely
moral
that
the
same
questions
always
arise
we
ought
not
to
grieve
over
the
discussion
over
the
and
heated
argument
that
start
from
a
knot
of
radicals
and
run
through
the
community
setting
men
against
each
other
the
quarrel
in
the
executive
committee
of
this
reform
body
is
the
initiative
of
much
wholesome
life
they
are
no
more
responsible
for
it
they
can
no
more
avoid
it
the
community
can
no
more
advance
to
higher
standards
before
they
have
had
it
than
a
child
can
skate
before
it
can
walk
the
executive
committee
is
discussing
the
schools
in
consequence
of
a
recent
agitation
the
politicians
have
put
up
a
candidate
who
will
give
new
plumbing
even
if
he
does
steal
the
books
and
the
question
is
whether
the
school
association
shall
indorse
this
candidate
if
it
does
he
wins
if
it
does
not
both
plumbing
and
books
are
likely
to
remain
the
prey
of
the
other
party
and
the
lord
knows
how
bad
that
is
the
fight
rages
in
the
committee
and
some
sincere
old
gentleman
is
prophesying
typhoid
the
practical
question
is
you
want
good
plumbing
or
do
you
want
the
truth
you
can
not
have
both
this
year
if
the
association
goes
out
and
tells
the
public
exactly
what
it
knows
it
will
get
itself
laughed
at
insult
the
candidate
and
elect
his
opponent
if
it
tells
the
truth
it
might
as
well
run
a
candidate
of
its
own
as
a
protest
and
an
advertisement
of
that
truth
it
can
buy
good
plumbing
with
a
lie
and
the
old
gentleman
thinks
it
ought
to
do
so
the
reformers
are
going
to
endorse
the
candidate
and
upon
their
heads
will
be
visited
his
theft
of
the
books
they
have
sold
out
the
little
public
confidence
they
held
had
they
stood
out
for
another
year
under
the
practical
régime
which
they
had
already
endured
for
twenty
and
had
they
devoted
themselves
to
augmenting
the
public
interest
in
the
school
question
both
parties
would
have
offered
them
plumbing
and
books
to
allay
the
excitement
the
parties
might
perhaps
have
relaxed
their
grip
on
the
whole
school
system
rather
than
meet
the
issue
but
the
association
does
not
understand
this
it
does
not
as
yet
clearly
know
its
own
mind
all
this
procedure
this
going
forward
and
back
is
necessary
the
community
must
pass
through
these
experiences
before
it
discovers
that
the
shortest
road
to
good
schools
is
truth
a
few
men
learn
by
each
turn
of
the
wheel
and
these
men
tend
to
consolidate
they
become
a
sort
of
school
of
political
thought
they
see
that
they
do
not
care
a
whit
more
about
the
schools
than
they
do
about
the
parks
that
the
school
agitation
is
a
handy
way
to
make
the
citizens
take
notice
of
maladministration
in
all
departments
that
the
parties
may
be
left
to
reform
themselves
and
to
choose
the
most
telling
bid
for
popular
favor
that
the
parties
must
do
this
and
will
do
this
in
so
far
as
the
public
demands
it
and
will
not
do
it
under
any
other
circumstances
it
is
the
very
greatest
folly
in
the
world
for
an
agitator
to
be
content
with
a
partial
success
it
destroys
his
cause
he
fades
instantly
you
can
not
see
him
he
is
become
part
of
the
corrupt
and
contented
public
his
business
is
to
make
others
demand
good
administration
he
must
never
reap
but
always
sow
let
him
leave
the
reaping
to
others
there
will
be
many
of
them
and
their
material
accomplishments
will
be
the
same
whether
he
endorses
them
or
not
if
by
chance
some
party
some
administration
gives
him
one
hundred
per
cent
of
what
he
demands
let
him
acknowledge
it
handsomely
but
he
need
not
thank
them
they
did
it
because
they
had
to
or
because
their
conscience
compelled
them
in
neither
case
was
it
done
for
him
in
other
words
reform
is
an
idea
that
must
be
taken
up
as
a
whole
you
do
not
want
any
specific
thing
you
use
every
issue
as
a
symbol
let
us
give
up
the
hope
of
finding
any
simpler
way
out
of
it
let
us
take
up
the
burden
at
its
heaviest
end
and
acknowledge
that
nothing
but
an
increase
of
personal
force
in
every
american
can
change
our
politics
it
is
curious
that
this
course
which
is
the
shortest
cut
to
the
millennium
should
be
met
with
the
reproach
that
it
puts
off
victory
this
is
entirely
due
to
a
defect
in
the
imagination
of
people
who
are
dealing
with
an
unfamiliar
subject
we
have
to
learn
its
principles
we
know
that
what
we
really
want
is
all
of
virtue
but
it
seems
so
unreasonable
to
claim
this
that
we
try
to
buy
it
piecemeal
item
a
schoolhouse
item
four
parks
and
with
each
gain
comes
a
sacrifice
of
principle
disintegration
discouragement
fools
if
you
had
asked
for
all
you
would
have
had
this
and
more
we
are
defeated
by
compromise
because
no
matter
how
much
we
may
deceive
ourselves
into
thinking
that
good
government
is
an
aggregate
of
laws
and
parks
it
is
not
true
good
government
is
the
outcome
of
private
virtue
and
virtue
is
one
thing
a
unit
a
force
a
mode
of
motion
it
can
not
pass
through
a
of
casuistry
at
any
point
compromise
is
loss
first
because
it
stops
the
movement
and
kills
energy
second
because
it
encourages
the
illusion
that
the
wooden
schoolhouse
is
good
government
as
against
this
you
have
the
fact
that
some
hundreds
of
school
children
do
get
housed
six
months
before
they
would
have
been
housed
otherwise
but
this
is
like
cashing
a
draft
for
a
thousand
pounds
with
a
dish
of
oatmeal
we
have
perhaps
followed
in
the
wake
of
some
little
reform
movement
and
it
has
left
us
with
an
insight
into
the
relation
between
private
opinion
and
public
occurrences
we
have
really
found
out
two
things
first
that
in
order
to
have
better
government
the
talk
and
private
intelligence
upon
which
it
rests
must
be
going
forward
all
the
time
and
second
that
the
individual
conscience
intelligence
or
private
will
is
always
set
free
by
the
same
process
to
wit
by
the
telling
of
truth
the
identity
between
public
and
private
life
reveals
itself
the
instant
a
man
adopts
the
plan
of
indiscriminate
truthtelling
he
unmasks
batteries
and
discloses
wires
at
every
he
sees
practical
politics
in
every
law
office
and
social
influence
in
every
convention
and
wherever
he
is
he
suddenly
finds
himself
by
his
own
will
or
against
it
a
centre
of
forces
let
him
blurt
out
his
opinion
instantly
there
follows
a
little
flash
of
reality
the
shams
drop
and
the
lines
of
human
influence
the
vital
currents
of
energy
are
disclosed
the
only
difference
between
a
reform
movement
and
the
private
act
of
any
man
who
desires
to
better
conditions
is
that
the
private
man
sets
one
in
a
ferment
by
speaking
his
mind
or
by
cutting
his
friend
and
the
agitator
sets
ten
thousand
in
a
ferment
by
attacking
the
age
as
a
practical
matter
the
conduct
of
politics
depends
upon
the
talk
of
men
who
are
not
in
politics
at
all
government
is
carried
on
from
moment
to
moment
by
the
people
the
executive
is
a
mere
hand
and
arm
for
instance
there
is
a
public
excitement
about
civil
service
reform
a
law
is
passed
and
is
being
evaded
if
the
governor
is
to
set
it
up
again
he
must
be
sustained
by
the
public
they
must
follow
and
understand
the
situation
or
the
official
is
helpless
but
do
we
sustain
him
we
do
not
we
are
to
lend
power
to
his
hand
we
shall
have
to
be
strong
men
if
we
now
stood
ready
to
denounce
him
for
himself
falling
short
by
the
breadth
of
a
hair
of
his
whole
duty
our
support
when
we
gave
it
would
be
worth
having
but
we
are
starchless
and
deserve
a
starchless
service
what
did
you
find
out
at
the
last
meeting
of
the
library
committee
you
found
out
that
commissioner
nephew
was
in
the
piano
business
hence
the
views
on
the
music
question
repeat
it
to
the
first
man
you
meet
in
the
street
and
bring
it
up
at
the
next
meeting
of
the
committee
you
did
not
think
you
had
much
influence
in
town
politics
and
hardly
knew
how
to
step
in
yet
the
town
seems
to
have
no
time
for
any
other
subject
than
your
attack
on
the
commissioner
from
this
point
on
you
begin
to
understand
conditions
every
man
in
town
reveals
his
real
character
and
his
real
relation
to
the
town
wickedness
and
to
the
universe
by
the
way
he
treats
you
you
are
beginning
to
get
near
to
something
real
and
something
interesting
there
is
no
one
in
the
united
states
no
matter
how
small
a
town
he
lives
in
or
how
inconspicuous
he
or
she
is
who
does
not
have
three
invitations
a
week
to
enter
practical
politics
by
such
a
door
as
this
it
makes
no
difference
whether
he
regard
himself
as
a
scientific
man
studying
phenomena
or
a
saint
purifying
society
he
will
become
both
there
is
no
way
to
study
sociology
but
this
the
books
give
no
hint
of
what
the
science
is
like
they
are
written
by
men
who
do
not
know
the
world
but
who
go
about
gleaning
information
instead
of
trying
experiments
the
first
discovery
we
make
is
that
the
worst
enemy
of
good
government
is
not
our
ignorant
foreign
voter
but
our
educated
domestic
railroad
president
our
prominent
business
man
our
leading
lawyer
if
there
is
any
truth
in
the
optimistic
belief
that
our
standards
are
now
going
up
we
shall
soon
see
proofs
of
it
in
our
homes
we
shall
not
note
our
increase
of
virtue
so
much
by
seeing
more
crooks
in
sing
sing
as
by
seeing
fewer
of
them
in
the
you
can
acquire
more
knowledge
of
american
politics
by
attacking
in
open
talk
a
political
lawyer
of
social
standing
than
you
can
in
a
year
of
study
these
backstair
men
are
in
every
bar
association
and
every
reform
club
they
are
the
agents
who
supervise
the
details
of
corruption
they
run
between
the
capitalist
the
boss
and
the
public
official
they
know
as
fact
what
every
one
else
knows
as
inference
they
are
the
priestly
class
of
commerce
and
correspond
to
the
intriguing
ecclesiastics
in
periods
of
church
ascendency
some
want
money
some
office
some
mere
power
others
want
social
prominence
and
their
art
is
to
play
off
interest
against
interest
and
advance
themselves
as
the
president
of
a
social
club
i
have
a
power
that
i
can
use
against
my
party
boss
or
for
him
if
he
can
count
upon
me
to
serve
him
at
need
it
is
a
gain
to
him
to
have
me
establish
myself
as
a
reformer
the
most
dependable
of
these
confidence
men
for
they
betray
nobody
and
are
universally
used
and
trusted
can
amass
money
and
stand
in
the
forefront
of
social
life
and
now
and
then
one
of
them
is
made
an
archbishop
or
a
foreign
minister
they
are
indeed
the
of
the
age
the
essence
of
all
the
wickedness
and
degradation
of
our
times
so
long
as
such
men
enjoy
public
confidence
we
shall
remain
as
we
are
they
must
be
deposed
in
the
public
mind
and
yet
these
gentlemen
are
the
weakest
point
in
the
serried
ranks
of
iniquity
they
are
weak
because
they
have
social
ambition
and
the
place
to
reach
them
is
in
their
clubs
they
are
the
best
possible
object
lessons
because
everybody
knows
them
social
punishment
is
the
one
cruel
reality
the
one
terrible
weapon
the
one
judgment
against
which
lawyers
can
not
protect
a
man
it
is
as
silent
as
theft
and
it
raises
the
cry
of
thief
like
a
burglar
alarm
the
general
cowardice
of
this
age
covers
itself
with
the
illusion
of
charity
and
asks
in
the
name
of
christ
that
no
feelings
be
hurt
but
there
is
not
in
the
new
testament
any
hint
that
hypocrites
are
to
be
treated
with
charity
this
class
is
so
intrenched
on
all
sides
that
the
enthusiasts
can
not
touch
them
their
elbows
are
interlocked
they
sit
cheek
by
jowl
with
virtue
they
are
rich
they
possess
the
earth
how
shall
we
strike
them
very
easily
they
are
so
soft
with
feeding
on
politic
lies
that
they
drop
dead
if
you
give
them
a
dose
of
ridicule
in
a
denunciation
is
well
enough
but
laughter
is
the
true
ratsbane
for
hypocrites
if
you
set
off
a
few
jests
the
air
is
changed
the
men
themselves
can
not
laugh
or
be
laughed
at
for
revenge
has
given
them
masks
for
faces
you
may
see
a
whole
room
full
of
them
crack
with
pain
because
they
can
not
laugh
they
are
angry
and
do
not
speak
everybody
in
america
is
soft
and
hates
conflict
the
cure
for
this
both
in
politics
and
social
life
is
the
same
hardihood
give
them
raw
truth
they
think
they
will
die
their
friends
call
you
a
murderer
four
thousand
ladies
and
eighty
bank
directors
brought
vinegar
and
brown
paper
to
low
when
he
was
attacked
and
roosevelt
posed
as
a
martyr
because
it
was
said
up
and
down
that
he
acted
the
part
of
a
selfish
politician
what
humbug
how
is
it
that
all
these
things
grow
on
the
same
root
fraud
cowardice
formality
sentimentalism
and
a
lack
of
humor
why
do
people
become
so
solemn
when
they
are
making
a
deal
and
so
angry
when
they
are
defending
it
the
righteous
indignation
expended
in
protecting
roosevelt
would
have
founded
a
church
the
whole
problem
of
better
government
is
a
question
of
how
to
get
people
to
stop
simpering
and
saying
to
cant
a
is
an
aristocrat
b
is
a
boss
c
is
a
candidate
d
is
a
distiller
e
is
an
excellent
citizen
they
dine
gloomy
silence
would
be
more
respectable
than
this
chipper
concern
that
all
shall
go
well
is
not
this
politics
yes
and
the
very
essence
of
it
is
not
the
exposure
of
it
practical
reform
how
easily
the
arrow
goes
in
a
does
not
think
you
should
confound
him
with
b
nor
e
with
each
is
a
reformer
when
he
looks
to
the
right
and
a
scamp
as
seen
from
the
left
what
is
their
fault
collusion
a
means
so
they
all
mean
well
let
us
not
confound
the
gradations
of
their
virtue
but
can
we
call
any
one
an
honest
man
who
knowingly
consorts
with
thieves
this
they
all
do
let
us
declare
it
their
resentment
at
finding
themselves
classed
together
drives
the
wedge
into
the
clique
remember
too
that
there
is
no
such
thing
as
abstract
truth
you
must
talk
facts
you
must
name
names
you
must
impute
motives
you
must
say
what
is
in
your
mind
it
is
the
only
means
you
have
of
cutting
yourself
free
from
the
body
of
this
death
innuendo
will
not
do
nobody
minds
innuendo
we
live
and
breathe
nothing
else
if
you
are
not
strong
enough
to
face
the
issue
in
private
life
do
not
dream
that
you
can
do
anything
for
public
affairs
this
of
course
means
fight
not
but
now
it
is
only
in
the
course
of
conflict
that
any
one
can
come
to
understand
the
system
the
habit
of
thought
the
mental
condition
out
of
which
all
our
evils
arise
the
first
difficulty
is
to
see
the
evils
clearly
and
when
we
do
see
them
it
is
like
fighting
an
atmosphere
to
contend
against
them
they
are
so
universal
and
omnipresent
that
you
have
no
terms
to
name
them
by
you
must
burn
a
disinfectant
we
have
observed
thus
far
that
no
question
is
ever
involved
in
practical
agitation
except
so
long
as
a
man
is
trying
to
tell
the
truth
his
remarks
will
contain
a
margin
which
other
people
will
regard
as
mystifying
and
irritating
exaggeration
it
is
this
very
margin
of
controversy
that
does
the
work
the
more
accurate
he
is
the
less
he
exaggerates
the
more
he
will
excite
people
it
is
only
by
the
true
part
of
what
is
said
that
the
interest
is
roused
no
explosion
follows
a
lie
the
awaking
of
the
better
feelings
of
the
individual
man
is
not
only
the
immediate
but
the
ultimate
end
of
all
politics
nor
need
we
be
alarmed
at
any
collateral
results
no
one
has
ever
succeeded
in
drawing
any
valid
distinction
between
positive
and
negative
educational
work
except
this
that
in
so
far
as
a
man
is
positive
himself
he
does
positive
work
it
is
necessary
to
destroy
reputations
when
they
are
lies
peace
be
to
their
ashes
but
war
and
fire
until
they
be
ashes
this
is
positive
and
constructive
work
you
can
not
state
your
case
without
using
popular
illustrations
and
in
clearing
the
ground
for
justice
and
mercy
some
little
great
man
gets
shown
up
as
a
this
is
constructive
work
it
is
impossible
to
do
harm
to
reform
unless
you
are
taking
some
course
that
tends
to
put
people
to
sleep
strangely
enough
the
great
outcry
is
made
upon
occasions
when
men
are
refusing
to
take
such
a
course
this
is
due
to
the
hypnotism
of
wake
us
up
they
cry
can
not
stand
the
agony
of
it
and
the
rising
energy
with
which
they
speak
wakes
other
sleepers
in
the
early
stages
of
any
new
idea
the
only
advertising
it
gets
is
denunciation
this
is
so
much
better
than
silence
that
one
may
hail
it
as
the
dawn
you
must
speak
till
you
draw
blood
the
agitators
have
always
understood
this
such
men
as
wendell
phillips
were
not
extravagant
they
were
practical
men
their
business
was
to
get
heard
they
used
vitriol
but
they
were
dealing
with
the
hide
of
the
rhinoceros
if
you
look
at
the
work
of
the
people
by
the
light
of
what
they
were
trying
to
do
you
will
find
that
they
had
a
very
clear
understanding
of
their
task
the
reason
of
some
of
them
canted
a
little
from
the
strain
and
stress
but
they
were
so
much
nearer
being
than
their
contemporaries
that
we
may
claim
them
as
respectable
human
beings
they
were
the
rock
on
which
the
old
politics
split
they
were
a
new
force
as
soon
as
they
had
gathered
head
enough
to
affect
political
issues
they
broke
every
public
man
at
the
north
by
forcing
him
to
take
sides
there
is
not
a
man
of
the
era
whom
they
did
not
shatter
finally
their
own
leaders
got
into
public
life
and
it
was
not
till
then
that
the
new
era
began
the
same
thing
is
happening
it
is
the
function
of
the
reformer
to
crack
up
any
public
man
who
dodges
the
issue
of
corruption
or
who
tries
to
ride
two
horses
by
remaining
a
straight
party
man
and
shouting
reform
this
is
no
fault
it
is
a
natural
process
it
is
fate
some
fall
on
one
side
of
the
line
and
some
on
the
other
one
gets
the
office
and
the
next
loses
it
but
oblivion
yawns
for
all
of
them
there
is
no
cassia
that
can
embalm
their
deeds
they
can
do
nothing
interesting
nothing
that
it
lies
in
the
power
of
the
human
mind
to
remember
why
is
it
that
speeches
are
unreadable
he
had
the
earnestness
of
a
prophet
and
the
strength
almost
of
a
titan
but
he
was
engaged
in
framing
a
philosophy
to
protect
an
interest
he
was
maintaining
something
that
was
not
true
it
was
a
fallacy
it
was
a
pretence
it
was
a
house
built
on
the
sands
of
temporary
conditions
such
are
the
ideas
of
those
middling
good
men
who
profess
honesty
in
just
that
degree
which
will
keep
them
in
office
honesty
beyond
this
point
is
in
their
philosophy
incompatible
with
earthly
conditions
these
men
must
exist
at
present
they
are
an
organic
product
of
the
times
they
are
samples
of
mediocrity
but
they
have
nothing
to
offer
to
the
curiosity
of
the
next
generation
no
not
though
their
talent
was
employed
in
protecting
an
empire
as
it
is
now
employed
in
eking
out
the
supremacy
of
a
disease
in
a
country
whose
deeper
health
is
beginning
to
throw
the
poison
off
our
public
men
are
confronted
with
two
systems
of
politics
they
can
not
hedge
if
the
question
were
suddenly
to
be
lost
in
a
riot
no
doubt
a
good
administrator
might
win
applause
even
a
tammany
chief
but
we
have
no
riots
we
have
finished
the
war
with
spain
and
unless
foreign
complications
shall
set
in
we
are
about
to
sit
down
with
the
politicians
over
our
domestic
issue
theft
are
you
for
theft
or
against
it
you
be
both
and
your
conversation
the
views
you
hold
and
express
to
your
friends
are
the
test
it
is
only
because
politics
affect
or
reflect
these
views
that
politics
have
any
importance
at
all
your
agents
croker
hanna
are
serving
you
faithfully
now
nothing
else
is
to
be
heard
at
the
clubs
but
the
sound
of
little
hammers
riveting
abuse
there
is
another
side
to
this
shield
that
calls
not
for
scorn
but
for
pity
have
you
ever
been
in
need
of
money
almost
every
man
who
enters
our
society
joins
it
as
a
young
man
in
need
of
money
his
instincts
are
unsullied
his
intellect
is
fresh
and
strong
but
he
must
live
how
comes
it
that
the
country
is
full
of
maimed
human
beings
of
cynics
and
feeble
good
men
and
outside
of
this
no
form
of
life
except
the
diabolical
intelligence
of
pure
business
how
to
make
yourself
needed
it
is
the
problem
and
why
should
we
expect
a
young
american
to
act
differently
from
a
young
spaniard
at
the
court
of
philip
the
second
he
must
get
on
he
goes
into
a
law
office
and
if
he
is
offended
at
its
dishonest
practices
he
can
not
speak
he
soon
accepts
them
thereafter
he
can
not
see
them
he
goes
into
a
newspaper
office
the
same
a
a
a
shop
what
has
happened
to
these
fellows
at
the
end
of
three
years
that
their
minds
seem
to
be
drying
up
i
have
seen
many
men
i
knew
in
college
grow
more
and
more
uninteresting
from
year
to
year
is
there
something
in
trade
that
desiccates
and
flattens
out
that
turns
men
into
dried
leaves
at
the
age
of
forty
certainly
there
is
it
is
not
due
to
trade
but
to
intensity
of
combined
with
narrowness
of
occupation
if
i
had
to
make
my
way
at
the
court
of
queen
elizabeth
i
should
need
more
kinds
of
wits
and
more
knowledge
of
human
nature
than
in
the
new
york
button
trade
no
doubt
i
should
be
a
preoccupied
cringing
and
odious
sort
of
person
at
a
feudal
festivity
but
i
should
be
a
fascinating
man
of
genius
compared
to
john
painter
who
at
the
age
of
thirty
is
making
a
year
by
keeping
his
mouth
shut
and
attending
to
business
put
a
pressure
gauge
into
painter
and
measure
the
business
tension
at
new
york
in
he
is
passing
his
youth
in
a
trance
over
a
game
of
skill
and
thereby
earning
the
respect
and
admiration
of
all
men
do
not
blame
him
the
great
current
of
business
force
that
passes
through
the
port
of
new
york
has
touched
him
and
he
is
rigid
there
are
hundreds
of
these
fellows
and
they
make
us
think
of
the
young
man
who
has
to
support
his
family
and
who
must
compete
against
them
for
the
confidence
of
his
business
patrons
our
standard
of
commercial
honesty
is
set
by
that
current
it
is
entirely
the
result
of
the
competition
that
comes
from
wanting
to
do
the
same
thing
you
say
are
here
dealing
with
a
natural
force
if
you
like
it
withers
character
and
preoccupies
one
part
of
a
man
for
so
long
that
the
rest
of
him
becomes
numb
he
is
hard
and
queer
he
can
not
write
because
he
can
not
think
he
can
not
draw
because
he
can
not
think
he
can
not
enter
real
politics
because
he
can
not
think
he
is
all
the
wretch
you
depict
him
but
we
must
have
him
such
are
this
is
the
biggest
folly
in
the
world
and
shows
as
deep
an
intellectual
injury
in
the
mind
that
thinks
it
as
can
inflict
business
has
destroyed
the
very
knowledge
in
us
of
all
other
natural
forces
except
business
what
shall
we
do
to
diminish
this
awful
pressure
that
makes
politics
a
hell
and
wrings
out
our
manhood
till
you
will
find
the
americans
condone
the
death
of
their
brothers
and
fathers
who
perished
in
home
camps
during
the
spanish
war
because
it
all
happened
in
the
cause
of
trade
it
was
business
thrift
done
by
smart
men
in
pursuance
of
you
ask
what
you
can
do
to
diminish
the
tension
of
selfishness
which
is
as
cruel
as
superstition
and
which
is
not
in
one
place
but
everywhere
in
the
united
states
it
runs
a
hot
iron
over
young
intellect
and
crushes
character
in
the
bud
it
is
blindness
palsy
and
hip
disease
you
can
hardly
find
a
man
who
has
not
got
some
form
of
it
there
is
no
newspaper
which
does
not
show
signs
of
it
you
can
hardly
find
a
man
who
does
not
proclaim
it
to
be
the
elixir
of
life
the
of
civilization
what
can
you
do
why
you
can
oppose
it
with
other
natural
forces
you
yourself
can
not
turn
niagara
but
there
is
not
a
town
in
america
where
one
single
man
can
not
make
his
force
felt
against
the
whole
torrent
he
takes
a
stand
on
a
practical
matter
he
takes
action
against
some
abuse
what
does
this
accomplish
everything
how
many
people
are
there
in
your
town
well
every
one
of
them
gets
a
thrill
that
strikes
deeper
than
any
sermon
he
ever
heard
he
may
howl
but
he
hears
the
boy
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
believes
that
the
whole
outfit
of
morality
has
any
place
in
the
practical
world
every
class
contributes
its
comment
next
year
a
new
element
comes
forward
in
politics
as
if
the
franchise
had
been
extended
remember
this
you
can
not
though
you
owned
the
world
do
any
good
in
it
except
by
devising
new
ways
of
manifesting
the
fact
that
you
felt
in
a
particular
way
it
is
the
personal
influence
of
example
that
is
the
power
nothing
else
counts
you
can
do
harm
by
other
methods
but
not
good
this
influence
is
a
natural
force
and
works
like
steam
power
why
all
this
commotion
over
your
protest
if
you
accuse
the
mayor
of
being
a
thief
why
does
he
not
reply
in
the
words
of
modern
philosophy
course
a
thief
made
that
instead
of
that
he
resents
it
and
there
ensues
a
discussion
that
takes
attention
off
of
trade
and
qualifies
the
atmosphere
of
the
place
you
have
appreciably
relieved
the
tension
and
checked
the
plague
this
whole
subject
must
be
looked
at
as
a
crusade
in
the
cause
of
humanity
you
are
making
it
easier
for
every
young
man
in
town
to
earn
his
livelihood
without
paying
out
his
soul
and
conscience
you
can
not
help
any
one
man
you
are
forced
into
helping
them
all
at
once
every
time
a
man
asserts
himself
he
cuts
a
cord
that
is
strangling
somebody
the
first
time
that
independent
candidates
for
local
office
were
run
in
new
york
city
strong
men
cried
in
the
street
for
rage
the
supremacy
of
commerce
had
been
affronted
new
york
in
all
that
makes
life
worth
living
is
a
new
city
since
the
reform
movements
began
to
break
up
the
torpor
of
serfdom
you
asked
how
to
fight
force
it
must
be
fought
with
force
and
not
with
arguments
indeed
it
is
easier
to
start
a
reform
and
carry
it
through
than
it
is
to
explain
either
why
or
how
it
is
done
you
can
only
understand
this
after
you
have
been
three
times
ridiculed
as
a
reformer
and
then
you
will
begin
to
see
that
throughout
the
community
running
through
every
one
there
are
currents
of
beneficent
power
that
accomplish
changes
sometimes
visible
sometimes
hard
to
see
that
this
power
is
in
its
nature
quite
as
strong
quite
as
real
and
reliable
as
that
wall
street
current
terrible
forces
both
of
them
forever
operative
and
struggling
and
contending
together
as
they
surge
and
swell
through
the
people
it
is
the
sight
of
that
power
for
good
that
you
need
i
can
not
give
it
to
you
you
must
sink
your
own
shaft
for
it
it
is
this
beneficent
current
passing
from
man
to
man
that
makes
the
unity
of
all
efforts
for
public
betterment
you
have
a
movement
and
an
excitement
over
bad
water
and
it
leaves
you
with
kindergartens
in
your
schools
it
is
this
current
that
turns
your
remark
at
the
club
which
every
one
repeated
in
order
to
injure
you
into
a
piece
of
encouragement
to
the
clerk
who
could
not
have
made
it
himself
except
at
the
cost
of
his
livelihood
it
is
this
current
not
only
the
fear
of
it
but
the
presence
of
it
in
the
heart
of
your
merchants
that
leaves
them
at
your
mercy
cast
anything
into
this
current
and
it
goes
everywhere
like
aniline
dye
put
into
a
reservoir
it
tinges
the
whole
local
life
in
hours
it
is
to
this
current
that
all
appeals
are
made
all
party
platforms
all
resolutions
all
lies
are
dedicated
to
it
all
literature
lives
by
it
the
head
of
power
is
near
and
easy
if
you
strike
directly
for
it
there
is
an
opinion
abroad
that
good
politics
requires
that
every
man
should
give
his
whole
time
to
politics
this
is
another
of
the
superstitions
disseminated
by
the
politicians
who
want
us
to
go
to
their
primaries
and
accepted
by
people
so
ignorant
of
life
that
they
believe
that
the
temperature
depends
upon
the
thermometer
why
you
are
running
those
primaries
now
if
you
were
different
they
would
become
different
you
need
never
go
near
them
go
into
that
camp
where
your
instinct
leads
you
the
improvement
in
politics
will
not
be
marked
by
any
cyclonic
overturn
there
will
always
be
two
parties
competing
for
your
vote
it
takes
no
more
time
to
vote
for
a
good
man
than
for
a
bad
man
there
will
be
no
more
men
in
public
life
then
than
now
there
will
be
no
overt
change
in
conditions
a
few
leaders
will
stand
for
the
new
forces
it
is
true
that
it
requires
a
general
increase
of
interest
on
the
part
of
every
one
in
order
that
these
men
shall
be
found
your
personal
duty
is
to
support
them
in
private
and
public
that
is
all
the
extent
to
which
you
yourself
become
involved
in
public
affairs
depends
upon
chances
with
which
you
need
not
concern
yourself
only
try
to
understand
what
is
happening
under
your
eyes
every
time
you
see
a
group
of
men
advancing
some
cause
that
seems
sensible
and
being
denounced
on
all
hands
as
see
if
it
was
not
something
in
yourself
after
all
that
appointed
those
men
as
we
grow
old
what
have
we
to
rely
on
as
a
touchstone
for
the
times
you
once
had
your
own
causes
and
enthusiasms
but
you
can
not
understand
these
new
ones
you
had
your
certificate
from
the
almighty
but
these
fellows
are
what
you
wanted
was
clear
but
these
men
want
something
unattainable
something
that
society
as
you
know
it
can
not
supply
calm
yourself
my
friend
perhaps
they
bring
it
has
the
great
philosophy
of
evolution
done
nothing
for
the
mind
of
man
that
new
developments
as
they
arrive
are
received
with
the
same
stony
solemnity
are
greeted
with
the
same
phrases
as
ever
how
can
you
have
the
ingenuousness
to
argue
soberly
against
me
supplying
me
by
every
word
you
say
with
new
illustrations
new
hope
new
fuel
until
i
heard
you
repeat
word
by
word
the
of
crumbling
conservatism
i
was
not
sure
i
was
right
you
have
placed
the
great
seal
of
the
world
upon
new
truth
thus
should
it
be
received
the
radicals
are
really
always
saying
the
same
thing
they
do
not
change
everybody
else
changes
they
are
accused
of
the
most
incompatible
crimes
of
egoism
and
a
mania
for
power
indifference
to
the
fate
of
their
own
cause
fanaticism
triviality
want
of
humor
buffoonery
and
irreverence
but
they
sound
a
certain
note
hence
the
great
practical
power
of
consistent
radicals
to
all
appearance
nobody
follows
them
yet
every
one
believes
them
they
hold
a
and
sound
a
and
everybody
knows
it
really
is
a
though
the
pitch
is
g
flat
the
community
can
not
get
that
a
out
of
its
head
nothing
can
prevent
an
upward
tendency
in
the
popular
tone
so
long
as
the
real
a
is
kept
sounding
every
now
and
then
the
whole
town
strikes
it
for
a
week
and
all
the
bells
ring
and
then
all
sinks
to
suppressed
discord
and
denial
the
reason
why
we
have
not
of
late
years
had
strong
consistent
centres
of
influence
focuses
of
steady
political
power
has
been
that
the
community
has
not
developed
men
who
could
hold
the
note
it
was
only
when
the
note
made
a
temporary
concord
with
some
heavy
political
scheme
that
the
reform
leaders
could
hear
it
themselves
for
the
rest
of
the
time
it
threw
the
whole
civilization
out
of
tune
the
terrible
clash
of
interests
drowned
it
the
reformers
themselves
lost
it
and
wandered
up
and
down
guessing
it
is
imagined
that
nature
goes
by
jumps
and
that
a
whole
community
can
suddenly
sing
in
tune
after
it
has
been
caterwauling
and
murdering
the
scale
for
twenty
years
the
truth
is
we
ought
to
thank
god
when
any
man
or
body
of
men
make
the
discovery
that
there
is
such
a
thing
as
absolute
pitch
or
absolute
honesty
or
absolute
personal
and
intellectual
integrity
a
few
years
of
this
spirit
will
identify
certain
men
with
the
fundamental
idea
that
truth
is
stronger
than
consequences
and
these
men
will
become
the
most
serious
force
and
the
only
truly
political
force
in
their
community
their
ambition
is
illimitable
for
you
can
not
set
bounds
to
personal
influence
but
it
is
an
ambition
that
can
not
be
abused
a
departure
from
their
own
course
will
ruin
any
one
of
them
in
a
night
and
undo
twenty
years
of
service
it
would
be
natural
that
such
sets
of
men
should
arise
all
over
the
country
men
who
nothing
and
should
reveal
the
inverse
position
of
the
boss
system
a
set
of
moral
bosses
with
no
organizations
no
politics
men
thrown
into
prominence
by
the
operation
of
all
the
forces
of
human
nature
now
suppressed
and
the
suppression
of
those
now
operative
it
is
obvious
that
one
such
man
will
suffice
for
a
town
in
the
competition
of
character
one
man
will
be
naturally
fixed
upon
whom
his
competitors
will
be
the
first
to
honor
and
upon
him
will
be
condensed
the
public
feeling
the
confidence
of
the
community
if
the
extreme
case
do
not
arise
nevertheless
it
is
certain
that
the
tendencies
toward
a
destruction
of
the
present
system
will
reveal
themselves
as
a
tendency
making
for
the
weight
of
personal
character
in
practical
politics
reform
politics
is
after
all
a
simple
thing
it
demands
no
great
attainments
you
can
play
the
game
in
the
dark
a
child
can
understand
it
there
are
no
subtleties
nor
obscurities
no
higher
analysis
or
mystery
of
any
sort
if
you
want
a
compass
at
any
moment
in
the
midst
of
some
difficult
situation
you
have
only
to
say
to
yourself
is
larger
than
this
little
imbroglio
i
shall
follow
my
as
you
say
this
your
compass
swings
true
you
may
be
surprised
to
find
what
course
it
points
to
but
what
it
tells
you
to
do
will
be
practical
agitation
iii
the
masses
let
us
examine
current
beliefs
on
popular
education
and
then
thereafter
let
us
look
very
closely
at
the
work
done
among
the
poor
and
see
upon
what
lines
it
has
been
found
possible
to
establish
influence
why
is
it
that
if
you
go
down
to
the
bowery
and
set
up
a
kindergarten
or
give
a
course
of
lectures
on
the
duties
of
citizenship
every
one
commends
you
whereas
if
you
go
into
some
abandoned
district
where
a
tammany
thug
is
running
for
the
state
assembly
against
a
republican
heeler
and
if
you
put
an
honest
man
in
the
field
against
them
both
your
friends
call
you
a
fool
and
say
that
your
reform
consists
of
mere
negation
who
asks
to
see
the
results
upon
the
public
welfare
of
a
night
school
in
astronomy
yet
if
you
get
ten
mechanics
to
labor
for
six
months
with
the
fire
of
enthusiasm
in
them
building
up
a
radical
club
and
as
a
result
one
hundred
and
fifty
men
cast
for
the
first
time
in
their
lives
a
vote
that
represents
the
heart
and
conscience
of
each
your
intelligent
friends
ask
have
you
done
you
are
howling
against
the
why
is
it
that
if
you
are
a
grocer
and
refuse
to
sand
your
sugar
you
are
called
honest
yet
if
a
young
politician
takes
this
course
it
is
supposed
that
life
is
not
long
enough
for
the
world
to
discover
his
value
he
is
a
visionary
in
the
sugar
trade
the
man
insisted
upon
dealing
with
the
community
as
a
whole
he
was
not
trying
to
sell
sugar
to
a
club
or
to
benefit
some
district
he
dealt
with
the
public
now
if
a
politician
deals
directly
with
the
public
we
condemn
him
because
we
can
not
see
the
empire
of
confidence
he
is
building
up
the
reason
we
do
not
see
it
is
entirely
due
to
historical
causes
we
have
had
little
experience
recently
in
the
utility
of
large
appeals
we
forget
their
power
yet
we
are
not
without
examples
grover
cleveland
dealt
directly
with
the
people
on
a
great
scale
he
established
a
personal
relation
that
was
stronger
than
party
bonds
this
made
him
president
preserved
his
character
and
gave
reality
to
politics
it
was
a
bit
of
education
to
every
man
in
the
united
states
to
see
what
our
political
arks
were
made
of
a
man
laid
his
hand
on
the
end
of
one
of
them
and
tore
off
the
roof
we
are
rather
more
familiar
with
the
power
of
public
confidence
as
seen
in
times
of
revolution
in
the
year
of
the
lexow
investigation
the
people
of
new
york
city
believed
that
parkhurst
and
john
goff
were
in
earnest
there
was
a
period
of
a
few
weeks
when
goff
exercised
the
powers
of
a
dictator
the
police
commissioners
had
threatened
to
discipline
a
subordinate
who
had
testified
before
committee
he
subpoenaed
them
all
the
next
morning
and
he
browbeat
them
like
they
went
back
humbled
the
revelations
of
the
summer
had
awakened
the
spirit
of
revolt
in
the
masses
of
the
people
and
it
expressed
itself
directly
as
power
the
machinery
of
government
was
not
in
abeyance
but
it
was
seen
to
be
a
mere
vehicle
it
could
be
made
to
work
justice
here
were
two
men
goff
and
parkhurst
rendered
by
the
existence
of
popular
confidence
the
state
of
mind
of
the
community
was
unusual
and
the
indignation
soon
subsided
but
it
subsided
to
a
new
level
and
the
abuses
and
inhumanity
of
boss
tyranny
have
never
since
been
so
severe
in
new
york
our
people
have
seen
several
volcanic
eruptions
of
this
sort
and
therefore
they
believe
in
them
they
believe
in
the
moral
power
of
the
community
but
are
afraid
it
can
only
act
by
convulsion
they
think
that
some
new
principle
comes
into
play
at
such
times
something
which
is
not
a
constant
factor
in
daily
government
on
the
other
hand
we
have
all
been
trained
to
respect
plodding
methods
in
common
education
and
we
know
that
much
can
be
done
by
kindergartens
clubs
and
propaganda
to
change
the
standards
of
the
community
and
make
men
trust
virtue
we
believe
in
the
club
and
we
believe
in
the
earthquake
we
forget
that
the
same
principle
underlies
them
both
when
some
one
applies
this
principle
to
the
field
of
political
education
that
lies
between
them
we
are
cynical
because
we
have
no
experience
apart
from
the
lack
of
experience
that
prevents
people
from
seeing
the
use
of
this
practical
activity
there
are
two
distressing
elements
that
make
men
not
want
to
see
it
in
the
first
place
even
if
you
work
in
the
bowery
and
a
friend
votes
in
harlem
you
are
apt
to
be
hitting
his
interests
and
prejudices
and
in
the
second
place
your
conduct
is
a
horrid
appeal
if
this
work
is
useful
he
ought
to
be
doing
it
he
had
hoped
that
nothing
could
be
done
the
real
distinction
between
this
particular
sort
of
work
and
other
philanthropy
is
that
other
philanthropy
is
preparatory
drill
this
is
war
the
other
is
feeding
training
and
preaching
this
is
practice
now
you
may
have
your
license
to
preach
all
you
please
in
the
vineyard
but
if
you
touch
the
soil
with
the
spade
you
find
the
ground
is
you
are
fighting
a
railroad
and
this
condition
is
openly
recognized
in
cities
where
the
evil
forces
are
completely
dominant
in
lecturing
before
the
university
extension
in
pennsylvania
you
are
not
allowed
to
talk
politics
it
is
against
the
policy
of
the
philanthropists
who
run
the
institution
and
who
are
run
by
the
railroad
the
situation
in
philadelphia
is
merely
illustrative
of
the
distinction
between
philanthropy
and
political
reform
which
is
always
ready
to
become
apparent
of
course
so
long
as
the
railroad
distributes
the
philanthropy
there
will
result
nothing
but
tyranny
the
roman
emperors
gave
shows
to
amuse
the
people
and
we
give
them
talks
on
botticelli
and
pictures
of
the
nile
there
are
then
real
reasons
why
our
people
are
slow
to
acknowledge
the
utility
of
militant
political
reform
and
why
they
clutch
at
any
handle
against
it
but
we
have
much
more
to
learn
from
the
philanthropists
by
a
study
of
what
they
have
done
than
by
dwelling
on
their
shortcomings
they
have
labored
while
the
political
reformers
have
slept
and
after
many
trials
and
many
failures
they
have
found
certain
working
principles
it
was
they
who
discovered
that
we
can
not
as
human
nature
is
constituted
give
strength
to
any
one
except
by
helping
the
whole
man
to
develop
at
once
we
must
give
him
a
chance
to
grow
the
workers
among
the
poor
have
long
ago
seen
the
futility
of
any
effort
except
that
of
raising
the
general
standards
of
living
they
have
established
settlements
where
the
relation
between
the
settlers
and
the
surrounding
population
is
as
natural
as
family
life
and
as
perennial
as
tammany
hall
after
ten
years
of
experiment
this
has
been
done
in
many
places
if
you
will
go
to
one
of
these
places
and
study
exactly
what
has
happened
in
the
line
of
benefit
to
the
people
you
will
see
that
it
has
resulted
from
personal
influence
that
is
to
say
from
the
effect
of
character
upon
character
years
ago
we
established
a
club
and
soon
afterwards
a
kindergarten
the
boys
returned
one
day
and
out
of
jealousy
smashed
everything
belonging
to
the
kindergarten
and
piled
the
rubbish
in
the
middle
of
the
room
last
week
a
barrel
of
fruit
was
sent
here
for
the
sick
and
weakly
and
we
left
the
barrel
open
with
a
card
on
the
outside
to
that
effect
you
could
not
get
the
boys
to
touch
the
fruit
now
if
you
ask
me
what
system
or
what
part
of
the
system
has
caused
the
change
in
these
boys
i
this
is
reform
politics
but
unless
you
and
i
go
there
and
make
a
place
for
these
boys
in
practical
politics
they
will
find
waiting
for
them
nothing
but
the
caucus
and
the
job
they
will
relapse
and
forget
it
is
throwing
effort
into
the
sea
to
train
the
young
if
you
stop
there
the
test
comes
when
the
scaffoldings
of
early
life
are
taken
down
each
man
meets
the
world
alone
the
tragedies
of
character
occur
at
this
period
we
must
make
a
camp
and
standing
ground
for
grown
men
so
far
as
the
hope
of
political
purity
goes
there
are
acres
of
this
city
that
are
in
a
worse
condition
than
health
was
in
before
the
era
of
hospitals
fly
over
them
as
the
crow
flies
and
you
can
not
find
a
centre
of
downright
antagonism
to
evil
the
population
does
not
know
that
such
a
thing
exists
and
yet
if
you
propose
to
go
there
and
set
up
a
fight
against
both
parties
that
is
to
say
a
fight
against
wickedness
you
are
told
by
patriots
and
doctors
of
divinity
do
it
unless
you
can
win
you
will
disgust
people
with
it
is
awful
and
at
the
same
time
ludicrous
to
hear
an
educated
person
maintain
this
doctrine
and
in
the
same
breath
mourn
over
the
corruption
of
the
masses
the
man
throws
his
own
dark
shadow
over
them
and
bewails
their
want
of
light
he
doubts
the
power
of
personal
influence
and
yet
there
is
absolutely
no
other
force
for
good
in
the
world
and
never
has
been
let
us
stick
to
facts
take
individual
cases
of
improvement
and
see
what
power
has
been
at
work
you
will
find
that
you
disclose
behind
any
personal
improvement
not
a
ballot
law
or
an
organization
but
a
human
being
the
movement
for
political
reform
goes
into
the
bowery
in
the
wake
of
the
philanthropists
we
go
there
knowing
something
about
practical
politics
we
know
for
instance
that
the
bowery
is
the
geographical
name
for
a
district
which
is
really
governed
by
the
same
forces
as
fifth
avenue
to
think
that
the
politics
of
the
bowery
are
controlled
by
the
bowery
is
about
as
sensible
as
to
believe
that
the
politics
of
irkutsk
are
controlled
at
irkutsk
we
have
got
first
to
disclose
the
machinery
of
evil
and
then
to
fight
it
wherever
we
find
it
even
though
it
lead
us
into
churches
nothing
is
needed
in
any
tammany
club
on
the
bowery
that
is
not
needed
ten
times
as
much
in
the
union
league
club
on
fifth
avenue
personal
for
principle
in
a
cause
which
is
apparently
hopeless
unless
you
go
there
displaying
that
you
are
not
needed
our
intercourse
with
the
laboring
man
is
a
great
teacher
to
ourselves
that
is
its
main
use
it
brings
out
as
nothing
else
can
the
magnitude
and
perfection
of
the
system
whose
visible
top
and
little
flag
we
can
always
see
but
whose
dimensions
and
ramifications
nothing
but
experiment
can
reveal
philosophy
could
not
guess
it
here
is
a
laborer
on
the
street
railroad
in
order
to
get
work
he
must
show
a
ticket
from
the
party
boss
it
is
his
passport
from
the
czar
countersigned
by
the
proper
official
otherwise
he
gets
no
job
here
is
a
young
notary
whom
you
employ
to
carry
about
the
certificate
that
puts
an
independent
candidate
in
nomination
you
try
to
get
him
to
sign
the
thing
himself
and
join
your
club
it
is
no
use
asking
his
brother
did
it
once
and
lost
his
place
so
close
is
the
scrutiny
so
rapid
the
punishment
examine
the
retail
grocer
or
the
tobacconist
or
the
cobbler
go
into
particulars
with
him
and
you
will
find
that
his
unwillingness
to
join
your
movement
does
not
spring
so
directly
from
his
inability
to
see
the
point
of
it
as
from
fear
of
the
direct
and
immediate
consequences
to
himself
we
wanted
to
elevate
the
masses
but
it
turns
out
as
the
philanthropists
discerned
long
ago
that
there
are
no
masses
in
america
there
are
no
masses
in
new
york
city
we
can
discover
only
individuals
who
are
each
controlled
by
individual
interests
by
various
and
subtle
considerations
these
men
are
in
chains
to
other
men
who
often
live
in
other
parts
of
the
city
the
attorneys
and
merchants
the
business
world
in
fact
is
found
to
be
in
league
with
abuse
the
man
who
signs
the
license
to
work
reports
twice
a
day
to
a
big
contractor
who
is
director
in
a
bank
whose
president
owns
the
opera
house
and
endowed
the
home
he
built
the
yacht
club
is
vestryman
in
the
biggest
church
and
is
revered
by
all
men
the
and
registry
books
of
all
visible
wealth
show
the
names
of
his
intimate
friends
all
we
can
do
in
the
way
of
weakening
the
chains
is
to
expose
them
this
cruelty
is
largely
ignorance
the
beneficiaries
must
be
made
to
see
the
sources
of
their
wealth
it
is
with
business
not
coldness
of
heart
that
conceals
the
conditions
the
american
business
man
is
a
being
he
does
not
even
care
for
money
but
for
the
game
of
business
as
matters
now
stand
in
america
we
see
this
condition
that
it
is
for
the
immediate
interest
of
the
dominant
class
namely
the
class
to
keep
the
people
as
selfish
as
possible
we
have
examined
the
subtle
strains
of
influence
and
prejudice
by
which
this
commercial
interest
has
been
extended
until
as
a
practical
matter
it
is
almost
impossible
for
a
man
to
get
word
to
the
laboring
classes
that
there
exists
such
a
thing
as
political
morality
some
professional
philanthropist
always
stands
ready
to
prevent
the
signal
of
honesty
from
being
raised
some
set
of
sunday
citizens
interposes
to
stop
the
unwise
inexpedient
foolhardy
attempt
to
be
independent
of
rascality
and
when
you
do
succeed
in
reaching
the
mechanic
what
can
you
do
for
him
tell
him
to
be
a
man
and
strike
off
the
shackles
that
bind
him
here
we
are
as
helpless
before
the
poor
as
before
the
rich
facing
both
of
them
with
the
same
query
you
not
see
that
your
own
concession
call
it
poverty
or
call
it
poverty
of
will
is
one
element
of
this
oppression
the
difference
between
the
poor
and
the
financial
classes
is
one
of
spiritual
complexity
the
promoters
are
because
their
minds
have
been
able
to
grasp
and
utilize
the
complex
forces
made
up
of
the
minds
of
their
simpler
and
this
astuteness
leaves
them
less
open
to
unselfish
emotions
than
the
laboring
man
his
nature
is
more
intact
he
is
a
more
emotional
and
instinctive
being
it
is
for
this
reason
that
moral
reforms
have
come
from
the
lower
strata
of
society
the
people
have
as
much
to
lose
as
the
bankers
but
they
are
more
ready
to
lose
it
the
head
of
moral
feeling
in
the
community
has
got
to
grow
strong
enough
to
force
the
financier
to
take
his
clutch
off
the
laboring
man
before
you
can
reach
the
laboring
man
and
yet
labor
itself
will
contribute
more
than
its
share
towards
this
head
of
moral
feeling
and
therefore
you
must
go
among
the
laboring
classes
with
your
ideas
and
your
propaganda
but
beware
lest
you
give
him
a
stone
for
bread
you
can
do
no
more
for
a
man
because
you
call
yourself
a
than
if
you
were
a
mere
philanthropist
a
standards
of
political
thought
are
but
a
small
fraction
of
his
general
standards
and
unless
your
sense
of
truth
is
as
sharp
as
a
sword
you
had
better
not
come
near
the
laboring
man
the
point
here
made
is
and
it
is
of
great
importance
that
we
candidly
acknowledge
at
every
instant
the
nature
of
our
undertaking
and
the
nature
of
our
power
for
in
so
far
as
we
mistake
them
we
weaken
our
practical
utility
it
is
not
as
the
agent
of
any
institution
that
you
are
here
but
as
the
agent
of
conscience
at
the
dictation
of
personal
feeling
do
you
need
proof
that
you
yourself
draw
all
your
power
from
sheer
moral
influence
note
what
you
do
when
you
start
your
club
you
go
to
the
nearest
person
and
ask
for
money
for
rent
he
gives
it
to
you
out
of
his
fund
of
general
benevolence
to
whom
do
you
really
want
to
distribute
this
benevolence
to
every
one
you
feel
that
by
passing
it
on
through
a
group
and
series
of
boys
and
young
men
you
can
benefit
the
whole
country
you
use
them
as
a
mere
vehicle
you
know
that
you
can
only
help
them
by
getting
them
to
help
others
your
appeal
for
clients
then
goes
out
to
the
whole
district
your
club
puts
you
in
communication
with
every
man
in
it
in
teaching
your
club
or
in
exhorting
any
mortal
to
good
behavior
what
method
what
stimulus
do
you
use
whether
you
know
it
or
not
you
are
really
drawing
support
from
every
one
who
is
following
the
same
principle
all
over
the
city
all
over
the
country
all
over
the
world
do
you
not
ceaselessly
appeal
to
the
examples
of
washington
and
lincoln
to
the
books
and
conduct
of
men
whose
aims
were
your
aims
or
take
your
own
case
why
do
you
occupy
yourself
with
this
thing
this
activity
satisfies
your
demands
upon
life
nothing
else
does
you
are
the
creature
of
a
thousand
influences
and
if
you
begin
to
trace
them
you
find
that
you
are
fulfilling
the
will
of
toynbee
of
john
stuart
mill
of
kant
you
are
a
disciple
of
tolstoi
you
were
inspired
by
william
lloyd
garrison
it
is
they
as
much
as
you
who
are
doing
this
work
it
is
they
who
formulated
the
ideas
and
impressed
them
upon
you
your
great
friends
are
the
founders
of
religions
examine
the
actual
persons
who
give
you
practical
help
you
will
find
moses
you
will
find
christ
behind
them
what
you
are
using
is
the
fund
of
unselfishness
it
is
necessary
to
employ
the
whole
of
it
in
order
to
accomplish
anything
however
small
as
a
practical
matter
every
one
does
employ
the
whole
of
it
every
time
he
even
thinks
of
reform
now
just
as
we
can
trace
the
sources
of
our
power
in
the
great
currents
of
human
feeling
that
flow
down
to
us
out
of
the
past
so
we
can
foresee
the
accomplishments
of
that
power
in
enlarging
the
lives
of
men
who
come
after
us
we
are
sinking
the
foundations
of
a
new
politics
you
can
not
always
see
every
stone
but
it
has
gone
to
its
place
it
is
impossible
to
take
a
stand
for
what
you
think
is
a
true
theory
without
thereby
becoming
an
integral
factor
for
good
in
every
man
who
hears
of
it
it
is
impossible
to
be
that
factor
without
taking
that
stand
what
is
the
nature
of
the
good
you
can
do
to
the
laboring
man
his
mind
analyzes
you
in
a
flash
if
he
is
influenced
by
you
you
may
be
sure
that
it
is
by
something
in
you
that
you
had
not
intended
to
give
him
after
the
man
has
seen
you
he
has
been
moved
by
you
but
how
consult
your
own
remembrance
what
incident
of
character
impressed
you
most
when
you
were
a
child
do
you
remember
any
act
any
expression
or
gesture
or
anecdote
or
speech
that
had
a
lasting
influence
upon
you
now
i
ask
you
this
was
it
done
for
you
were
you
the
designed
beneficiary
of
it
was
it
not
rather
the
silent
part
of
some
one
conduct
a
thing
you
were
perhaps
not
meant
to
see
at
all
and
this
was
no
accident
this
is
the
natural
history
of
influence
it
passes
unconsciously
from
life
to
life
we
must
take
the
world
as
we
find
it
we
must
deal
with
human
nature
according
to
the
laws
of
human
nature
our
politics
are
at
present
so
artificial
that
the
average
man
thinks
that
the
name
prevents
the
well
established
and
familiar
principles
of
human
nature
from
being
operative
but
he
is
wrong
man
has
never
yet
succeeded
in
inventing
any
system
that
could
evade
them
or
affect
them
in
the
least
all
the
political
organization
of
reform
is
already
in
existence
and
needs
only
strengthening
and
developing
it
is
all
in
use
and
every
one
understands
its
use
and
knows
its
headquarters
and
its
agencies
it
is
all
individual
character
and
courage
and
with
the
growth
of
character
and
courage
it
will
become
more
defined
and
visible
every
day
iv
literature
there
are
feelings
and
views
about
life
there
are
conviction
and
insight
which
come
from
thinking
at
a
high
rate
of
speed
and
vanish
when
the
machinery
moves
slowly
and
the
blood
ebbs
the
world
not
only
accepts
the
intensity
of
the
writer
but
demands
it
nevertheless
the
world
has
an
imperfect
knowledge
as
to
where
this
intensity
comes
from
how
it
is
produced
or
what
relation
it
bears
to
ugliness
and
falsehood
a
pleasure
it
must
be
to
you
said
rothschild
to
heine
be
able
to
turn
off
those
little
songs
in
our
ordinary
moods
we
regard
the
conclusions
of
the
poets
as
both
true
and
untrue
true
to
feeling
untrue
to
fact
true
as
intimations
of
the
next
world
or
of
some
lost
world
untrue
here
because
detached
from
those
portions
of
society
that
are
perennially
visible
most
men
have
a
duplicate
philosophy
which
enables
them
to
love
the
arts
and
the
wit
of
mankind
at
the
same
time
that
they
conveniently
despise
them
life
is
ugly
and
necessary
art
is
beautiful
and
impossible
farther
you
go
from
the
facts
of
life
the
nearer
you
get
to
poetry
the
practical
problem
is
to
keep
them
in
separate
spheres
and
to
enjoy
the
hypothesis
of
a
duplicity
in
the
universe
explains
everything
and
staves
off
all
claims
and
questionings
such
are
the
convictions
of
the
average
cultivated
man
his
back
is
broken
but
he
lives
in
the
two
halves
comfortably
enough
he
has
to
be
protected
at
his
weak
spot
of
course
and
that
spot
is
the
present
ten
years
from
now
yesterday
the
day
of
judgment
the
state
of
pennsylvania
all
these
you
are
welcome
to
every
form
of
idealism
appeals
to
him
so
long
as
it
does
not
ask
him
to
budge
out
of
his
armchair
he
says
understand
this
it
takes
its
place
in
the
realm
of
the
this
man
does
not
know
and
has
no
means
of
knowing
that
good
books
are
only
written
by
men
whose
backs
are
not
broken
and
whose
vital
energy
circulates
through
their
entire
system
in
one
sweep
they
have
a
unitary
and
not
a
duplicate
philosophy
the
present
is
their
strong
point
the
actualities
of
life
are
their
passion
they
lay
a
bold
hand
upon
everything
within
their
reach
for
they
see
it
with
new
sight
the
glitter
of
the
past
makes
us
think
of
literature
as
embodied
in
books
but
to
understand
literature
we
must
fix
our
minds
on
authors
not
on
books
the
men
who
write
what
makes
them
write
well
or
ill
what
are
the
conditions
that
breed
poetry
or
music
or
architecture
the
current
beliefs
about
art
and
letters
are
fatalistic
it
is
supposed
that
poets
and
artists
crop
up
now
and
then
and
that
nothing
can
stop
them
they
need
no
aid
they
conquer
circumstances
i
do
not
believe
it
we
see
no
analogy
to
it
in
nature
among
the
plants
and
the
fishes
we
see
nothing
but
a
wholesale
and
incredible
destruction
of
germs
on
all
sides
it
seems
a
miracle
that
any
seed
should
fall
upon
good
ground
and
be
sheltered
till
it
come
to
the
flower
why
should
the
percentage
of
germs
that
come
to
maturity
be
greater
with
genius
than
it
is
with
the
eggs
of
the
sturgeon
the
enemies
of
each
are
numerous
if
it
were
not
for
the
fecundity
of
nature
we
should
have
none
of
either
of
them
and
how
is
it
that
the
great
man
always
happens
to
be
young
at
the
very
moment
when
some
events
are
going
forward
that
ripen
his
powers
so
that
he
grows
up
with
his
time
and
does
something
that
is
comprehensible
to
all
time
the
answer
is
that
all
eras
are
sown
thick
with
the
seeds
of
genius
which
for
the
most
part
die
but
in
a
favoring
age
mature
to
greatness
must
we
resort
to
a
theory
of
special
creation
to
explain
the
great
talents
of
the
world
and
even
this
would
not
explain
our
own
welcome
and
our
own
comprehension
of
them
when
they
come
if
it
were
not
for
the
undeveloped
powers
the
seeds
of
genius
in
ourselves
plato
and
bach
would
be
meaningless
and
christ
would
have
died
in
vain
it
must
be
that
thousands
of
good
intellects
perish
annually
the
men
do
not
die
but
their
powers
wither
or
rather
never
mature
art
like
everything
else
represents
an
escape
a
survival
in
any
age
that
lacks
it
or
is
weak
in
it
we
may
look
about
for
the
enginery
by
which
it
is
crushed
in
looking
into
a
past
age
we
are
put
to
inference
and
conjecture
we
see
the
mark
of
fetters
upon
the
byzantine
soul
and
we
begin
dredging
the
dark
waters
of
history
for
a
metaphysical
cause
we
can
not
walk
into
a
byzantine
shop
and
watch
the
apprentice
at
work
but
in
our
own
time
we
can
see
the
whole
process
in
action
we
can
study
our
modern
inquisitions
at
leisure
and
note
every
mark
that
is
made
upon
a
soul
that
is
passing
through
them
it
does
not
involve
any
indignity
to
the
pretensions
of
literature
if
we
walk
into
that
great
bazaar
modern
journalism
and
see
what
is
going
on
there
behind
the
counters
here
is
a
factory
of
popular
art
it
is
not
the
whole
of
letters
but
it
has
an
influence
on
the
whole
of
letters
the
press
fills
the
consciousness
of
the
people
a
modern
community
breathes
through
its
press
journalism
to
be
sure
is
a
region
of
letters
where
all
the
factors
for
truth
are
at
a
special
and
peculiar
discount
its
attention
is
given
to
near
and
ugly
things
to
mean
quarrels
business
interests
and
special
ends
every
country
shows
up
badly
here
the
hypocrisy
of
the
press
is
the
worst
thing
in
england
it
is
the
worst
exhibition
of
worst
fault
the
press
of
france
gives
you
france
at
her
weakest
the
press
of
america
gives
you
america
at
her
cheapest
perhaps
the
study
of
journalism
in
any
country
would
illustrate
the
peculiar
vices
of
that
country
and
it
is
fair
to
remember
this
in
examining
our
own
press
but
examine
it
we
must
for
it
is
important
the
subject
includes
more
than
the
daily
newspapers
those
ephemeral
sheets
that
flutter
from
the
table
into
the
basket
which
are
something
more
than
mere
newspapers
and
less
than
magazines
and
the
magazines
themselves
which
are
more
than
budgets
of
gossip
and
less
than
books
make
up
a
perpetual
rain
of
paper
and
ink
thousands
of
people
are
engaged
in
writing
them
and
millions
in
reading
them
this
whole
species
of
literature
is
typical
of
the
age
let
us
see
how
it
is
conducted
a
journal
is
a
between
the
forces
of
intellect
and
of
commerce
the
men
who
become
editors
always
bear
some
relation
to
the
intellectual
interests
of
the
country
they
make
money
but
they
make
it
by
understanding
the
minds
of
people
who
are
not
taking
money
but
thought
from
the
exchanges
that
the
editors
set
up
a
magazine
or
a
newspaper
is
a
shop
each
is
an
experiment
and
represents
a
new
focus
a
new
ratio
between
commerce
and
intellect
even
trade
journals
have
columns
devoted
to
general
information
and
jokes
the
one
thing
a
journal
must
have
in
order
to
be
a
journal
is
circulation
it
must
be
carried
into
houses
and
this
is
brought
about
by
an
impulse
in
the
buyer
the
buyer
has
many
opinions
and
modes
of
thought
that
he
does
not
draw
from
the
journal
and
he
is
always
ready
to
drop
a
journal
that
offends
him
an
editor
is
thus
constantly
forced
to
choose
between
affronting
his
public
and
placating
his
public
now
whatever
arguments
may
be
given
for
his
taking
one
course
or
the
other
it
remains
clear
that
in
so
far
as
an
editor
is
not
publishing
what
he
himself
thinks
of
interest
for
its
own
sake
he
is
encouraging
in
the
public
something
else
besides
intellect
he
is
subserving
financial
political
or
religious
bias
or
it
may
be
popular
whim
he
is
to
this
extent
at
least
the
custodian
and
protector
of
prejudice
the
thrift
of
an
who
is
building
up
the
circulation
of
a
paper
tends
to
keep
him
conservative
repetition
is
safer
than
innovation
an
especially
strong
temptation
is
spread
before
the
american
editor
in
the
shape
of
an
enormous
reading
public
made
up
of
people
who
have
a
education
and
who
resemble
each
other
very
closely
in
their
traits
of
mind
there
is
money
to
be
made
by
any
one
who
discerns
a
new
way
of
reinforcing
any
prejudice
of
the
american
people
it
has
come
about
very
naturally
during
the
last
thirty
years
that
journalism
has
been
developed
in
america
as
one
of
the
branches
in
the
science
of
catering
to
the
masses
on
a
gigantic
scale
the
different
kinds
of
conservatism
have
been
banked
consolidated
and
as
it
were
marshalled
under
the
banners
of
as
many
journals
money
and
energy
have
been
expended
in
collecting
these
vast
audiences
and
sleepless
vigilance
is
needed
to
keep
them
together
the
great
investments
in
the
good
will
of
millions
are
nursed
by
editors
who
live
by
their
talents
and
who
in
another
age
would
have
been
intellectual
men
the
highest
type
of
editor
now
extant
in
america
will
as
frankly
regret
his
own
obligation
to
cater
to
mediocrity
as
the
business
man
will
regret
his
obligation
to
pay
blackmail
or
as
the
citizen
will
regret
his
obligation
to
vote
for
one
of
the
parties
is
nothing
else
to
do
i
am
dealing
with
the
money
of
others
there
are
not
enough
intelligent
people
to
he
serves
the
times
the
influence
thus
exerted
by
the
public
through
the
editor
upon
the
writer
tends
to
modify
the
writer
and
make
him
resemble
the
public
it
is
a
spiritual
pressure
exerted
by
the
majority
in
favor
of
conformity
this
exists
in
all
countries
but
is
peculiarly
severe
in
countries
and
ages
where
the
majority
is
made
up
of
individuals
very
similar
to
each
other
the
tyranny
of
a
uniform
population
always
makes
itself
felt
if
any
man
doubt
the
character
of
our
journals
let
him
try
this
experiment
let
him
write
down
what
he
thinks
upon
any
matter
write
a
story
of
any
length
a
poem
a
prayer
a
speech
let
him
assume
as
he
writes
it
that
it
can
not
be
published
and
let
him
satisfy
his
individual
taste
in
the
subject
size
mood
and
tenor
of
the
whole
composition
then
let
him
begin
his
peregrinations
to
find
in
which
one
of
the
ten
thousand
journals
of
america
there
is
a
place
for
his
ideas
as
they
stand
we
have
more
journals
than
any
other
country
the
whole
field
of
ideas
has
been
covered
every
vehicle
of
opinion
has
its
policy
its
methods
its
precedents
a
hundred
will
receive
him
if
he
shaves
this
pads
that
cuts
it
in
half
but
not
one
of
them
will
trust
him
as
he
stands
but
eccentric
but
too
long
but
let
us
follow
the
steps
of
this
withering
influence
a
young
illustrator
does
an
etching
that
he
likes
he
is
told
to
reduce
it
to
the
conventional
standard
this
is
easy
but
what
is
happening
in
the
process
he
blurs
the
fine
edges
of
vision
not
only
on
the
plate
but
in
his
own
mind
the
real
injury
to
intellect
is
not
done
in
the
editorial
sanctum
it
is
done
in
the
mind
of
the
writer
who
himself
attempts
to
cater
to
the
prejudice
of
others
a
man
rewrites
a
scene
in
a
story
to
please
a
public
in
order
to
do
this
he
is
obliged
to
forget
what
his
story
was
about
he
is
talking
by
rote
he
is
making
an
imitation
does
this
seem
a
small
thing
let
any
one
do
it
once
and
see
where
it
leads
him
the
attitude
of
the
whole
human
being
towards
his
whole
life
is
changed
by
the
experience
do
it
twice
and
you
can
hardly
shake
off
the
practice
write
and
publish
six
editorials
for
the
and
then
sit
down
to
write
one
not
in
the
style
of
the
you
will
find
it
practically
an
impossibility
the
notable
lack
in
our
literature
is
this
the
prickles
and
irregularities
of
personal
feeling
have
been
away
it
is
too
smooth
there
is
an
absence
of
individuality
of
private
opinion
this
is
the
same
lack
that
curses
our
politics
the
absence
of
private
opinion
the
sacrifice
in
political
life
is
honesty
in
literary
life
is
intellect
but
the
closer
you
examine
honesty
and
intellect
the
more
clearly
they
appear
to
be
the
same
thing
suppose
that
a
judge
in
order
to
please
a
boss
awards
parson
cow
to
deacon
brown
does
he
boldly
admit
this
even
to
himself
never
he
writes
an
able
opinion
in
which
he
befogs
his
intelligence
and
convinces
himself
that
he
has
arrived
at
his
award
by
logical
steps
in
like
manner
the
revising
editor
who
reads
with
the
eyes
of
the
daughter
begins
to
lose
his
own
he
is
extinguishing
some
sparks
of
instructive
reality
which
would
offend
and
benefit
the
daughter
and
he
is
obliterating
a
part
of
his
own
mind
with
every
stroke
of
his
blue
pencil
he
is
devitalizing
literature
by
erasing
personality
he
does
this
in
the
money
interests
of
a
syndicate
but
the
debasing
effect
upon
character
is
the
same
as
if
it
were
done
at
the
dictate
of
the
german
emperor
the
harm
done
in
either
case
is
intellectual
take
another
example
a
reporter
writes
up
a
public
meeting
but
colors
it
with
the
creed
of
his
journal
can
he
do
this
acceptably
without
abjuring
his
own
senses
he
is
competing
with
men
whose
every
energy
is
bent
on
seeing
the
occasion
as
the
newspaper
wishes
it
seen
consider
the
immense
difficulty
of
telling
the
truth
on
the
witness
stand
and
judge
whether
good
reporting
is
easy
the
newspaper
trade
as
now
conducted
is
prostitution
it
mows
down
the
boys
as
they
come
from
the
colleges
it
defaces
the
very
desire
for
truth
and
leaves
them
without
a
principle
to
set
a
clock
by
they
grow
to
disbelieve
in
the
reality
of
ideas
but
these
are
our
future
literati
our
poets
and
essayists
our
historians
and
publicists
the
experts
who
sit
in
the
offices
of
the
journals
of
the
country
have
so
long
used
their
minds
as
commercial
instruments
that
it
never
occurs
to
them
to
publish
or
not
publish
anything
according
to
their
personal
views
they
do
not
know
that
every
time
they
subserve
prejudice
they
are
ruining
intellect
if
there
were
an
editor
who
had
any
suspicion
of
the
way
the
world
is
put
together
he
would
respect
talent
as
he
respects
honor
it
would
be
impossible
for
him
to
make
his
living
by
this
traffic
if
he
knew
what
he
was
doing
he
would
prefer
penury
these
men
then
have
not
the
least
idea
of
the
function
they
fulfil
no
more
has
the
agent
of
the
insurance
company
who
corrupts
a
legislature
the
difference
in
degree
between
the
two
iniquities
is
enormous
because
one
belongs
to
that
region
in
the
scale
of
morality
which
is
completely
understood
and
the
other
does
not
we
do
not
excuse
the
insurance
agent
we
will
not
allow
him
to
plead
ignorance
he
commits
a
penal
offence
we
will
not
allow
selfishness
to
trade
upon
selfishness
and
steal
from
the
public
in
this
form
but
what
law
can
protect
the
public
interest
in
the
higher
faculties
what
statute
can
enforce
artistic
truth
we
actually
forbid
a
man
by
statute
to
sell
his
vote
because
a
vote
is
understood
to
be
an
opinion
a
thing
dependent
on
rational
and
moral
considerations
you
can
not
buy
and
sell
it
without
turning
it
into
something
else
the
exercise
of
that
infinitesimal
fraction
of
public
power
represented
by
one
vote
is
hedged
about
with
penalties
because
the
logic
of
practical
government
has
forced
us
to
see
its
importance
but
the
harm
done
to
a
community
by
the
sale
of
a
vote
does
not
follow
by
virtue
of
the
statute
but
by
virtue
of
a
law
of
influence
of
which
the
statute
is
the
recognition
the
same
law
governs
the
sale
of
any
opinion
whether
it
be
conveyed
in
a
book
review
or
in
a
political
speech
in
a
picture
of
life
and
manners
a
poem
a
novel
or
an
etching
there
is
no
department
of
life
in
which
you
can
lie
for
private
gain
without
doing
harm
the
grosser
forms
of
it
give
us
the
key
to
the
subtler
ones
and
the
jail
becomes
the
symbol
of
that
condition
into
which
the
violation
of
truth
will
shut
any
mind
so
far
as
any
man
comes
directly
in
contact
with
the
agencies
of
organized
literature
let
him
remember
that
his
mind
is
at
stake
they
can
change
you
but
you
can
not
change
them
except
by
changing
the
public
they
reflect
the
faculties
of
man
are
as
strong
as
steel
if
properly
used
but
they
are
like
the
down
on
a
peach
if
improperly
used
what
shall
a
man
take
in
exchange
for
his
soul
no
man
has
the
privilege
upon
this
earth
of
being
more
than
one
person
in
this
matter
of
expression
it
is
the
last
ten
per
cent
of
accuracy
that
saves
or
sells
you
talent
evaporates
as
easily
as
a
delegate
holds
his
tongue
or
a
lawyer
smiles
to
a
rich
man
and
the
injury
is
irremediable
let
a
man
not
alter
a
line
or
cut
a
paragraph
at
the
suggestion
of
an
editor
those
are
the
very
words
that
are
valuable
you
say
i
need
then
go
to
a
critic
consult
the
man
who
is
farthest
away
from
this
influence
some
one
who
can
not
read
the
magazines
some
one
who
does
not
have
to
read
them
your
public
when
you
get
one
will
qualify
the
general
public
but
you
must
reach
it
as
a
whole
man
the
course
is
easy
compared
to
that
of
the
reform
politician
because
printing
is
cheap
he
will
get
heard
immediately
he
covers
the
whole
of
the
united
states
while
the
other
is
canvassing
a
ward
literary
is
as
much
needed
as
any
of
the
virtue
we
pray
for
in
politics
a
resonant
and
unvexed
independence
makes
a
words
stir
the
fibres
in
other
men
and
it
matters
little
whether
you
label
his
words
literature
or
politics
the
difficulty
in
any
revolt
against
custom
the
struggle
a
man
has
in
getting
his
mind
free
from
the
cobwebs
of
restraint
always
turns
out
to
involve
financial
distress
and
this
holds
true
of
the
attempt
to
override
the
senseless
restrictions
of
the
press
the
magazines
pay
handsomely
and
pay
at
once
a
writer
must
earn
his
bread
a
man
must
support
his
family
we
accept
this
necessity
with
such
a
hearty
concurrence
and
the
necessity
itself
becomes
so
sacred
that
it
seems
to
imply
an
answer
to
all
ethical
and
artistic
questions
we
almost
think
that
nature
will
connive
at
malpractice
done
in
so
good
a
cause
as
the
support
of
a
family
the
subject
must
be
looked
at
more
narrowly
the
spur
of
poverty
is
popularly
regarded
not
only
as
an
excuse
for
all
bad
work
but
as
a
prerequisite
to
all
good
work
there
is
a
misconception
in
this
wholesale
appropriation
of
a
partial
truth
the
economic
laws
are
valuable
and
suggestive
but
they
are
founded
on
the
belief
that
a
man
will
pursue
his
own
business
interests
exclusively
this
is
never
entirely
true
even
in
trade
and
the
doctrines
of
the
economists
become
more
and
more
misleading
when
applied
to
fields
of
life
where
the
money
motive
becomes
incidental
the
law
of
supply
and
demand
does
not
govern
the
production
of
sonnets
let
us
lay
aside
theory
and
observe
the
effects
of
want
upon
the
artist
and
his
work
as
a
stimulus
to
the
whole
man
a
prod
to
get
him
into
action
and
keep
him
active
the
spur
of
poverty
is
a
blessing
but
if
it
enter
into
the
detail
of
his
attention
while
he
is
at
work
it
is
damnation
a
man
at
work
is
like
a
string
that
is
vibrating
touch
it
with
a
feather
and
it
is
numb
a
singer
will
sing
flat
if
he
sees
a
friend
in
the
audience
even
a
trained
and
lawyer
who
is
trying
a
case
will
not
be
at
his
best
if
he
is
watched
by
some
one
whom
he
wants
to
impress
the
artist
is
the
easiest
of
all
men
to
upset
he
is
dealing
with
subtle
and
fluid
things
memories
allusions
associations
it
is
all
gossamer
and
sunlight
when
he
begins
it
is
to
be
gossamer
and
sunlight
when
he
is
finished
but
in
the
interim
it
is
bricks
and
mortar
rubble
and
white
lead
and
the
writer
i
do
not
say
that
he
must
be
more
free
from
cares
than
the
next
man
but
he
must
not
let
into
the
mint
and
forge
of
his
thought
some
immaterial
and
petty
fact
about
himself
for
this
will
make
him
consider
how
ingenuous
how
unexpected
how
natural
is
good
conversation
at
one
moment
you
have
nothing
to
say
at
the
next
a
vista
of
ideas
has
opened
they
come
crowding
in
and
the
telling
of
them
reveals
new
vistas
it
is
the
same
with
the
writer
in
the
process
of
writing
the
story
is
made
there
is
really
nothing
to
say
or
do
in
the
world
until
you
make
your
start
and
then
the
significance
begins
to
steam
out
of
the
materials
and
here
in
the
act
and
heat
of
creation
to
have
the
cold
fear
thrust
in
can
not
use
that
phrase
because
the
editor
will
think
it
too
strong
is
enough
to
chill
the
brain
of
rabelais
human
nature
can
not
stand
such
handling
do
this
to
a
man
and
you
break
his
spirit
he
becomes
tame
calculating
and
ingenious
his
powers
are
frozen
it
is
impossible
not
to
see
in
contemporary
journalism
a
for
mind
here
we
have
a
great
whale
that
browses
on
the
young
and
eats
them
by
thousands
this
is
the
seamy
side
of
popular
education
the
low
level
of
the
class
at
the
school
keeps
the
bright
boys
back
and
makes
dunces
of
them
we
have
been
dealing
in
all
this
matter
with
one
of
the
deepest
facts
of
life
to
wit
the
influence
that
society
at
large
has
in
cutting
down
and
narrowing
the
development
of
the
individual
the
newspaper
business
displays
the
whole
operation
very
vividly
but
we
may
see
the
same
thing
happening
in
the
other
walks
of
life
there
arrives
a
time
in
the
career
of
most
men
when
their
powers
become
fixed
men
seem
to
expand
to
definite
shapes
like
those
japanese
cuttings
that
open
out
into
flowers
and
plants
when
you
drop
them
into
warm
water
after
reaching
his
saturation
point
each
man
fills
his
niche
in
society
and
changes
little
he
goes
on
doing
whatever
he
was
engaged
upon
at
the
time
he
touched
his
limit
we
almost
believe
that
every
man
has
his
predestinate
size
and
shape
and
that
some
obscure
law
of
growth
arrests
one
man
at
thirty
and
the
next
at
forty
years
of
age
this
is
partly
true
but
the
law
is
not
obscure
it
is
not
because
the
men
stop
growing
that
they
repeat
themselves
but
they
stop
growing
because
they
repeat
themselves
they
cease
to
experiment
they
cease
to
search
the
lawyer
adopts
routine
methods
the
painter
follows
up
his
success
with
an
imitation
of
his
success
the
writer
finds
a
recipe
for
style
or
plot
every
one
saves
himself
the
trouble
of
the
contents
of
his
own
mind
he
has
the
best
possible
reason
for
doing
this
the
public
will
not
pay
for
his
experiments
as
well
as
it
will
for
his
routine
work
but
the
laws
of
nature
are
deaf
to
his
reasons
research
is
the
price
of
intellectual
growth
if
you
face
the
problems
of
life
freshly
and
squarely
each
morning
you
march
if
you
accept
any
solution
as
good
enough
you
drop
for
there
is
no
finality
and
ending
place
to
intellect
examine
any
bit
of
politics
any
or
domestic
complication
until
you
understand
your
own
reasons
for
feeling
as
you
do
about
it
then
write
the
matter
down
carefully
and
conclusively
and
you
will
find
that
you
have
done
no
more
than
restate
the
problem
in
a
new
form
the
more
complete
your
exposition
the
more
loudly
it
calls
for
new
solution
the
masterly
analysis
of
tolstoi
his
accurate
explanations
his
diagnosis
and
dissection
of
human
life
leave
us
with
a
picture
of
society
that
for
unsolved
mystery
competes
with
the
original
but
the
point
lies
here
you
must
lay
bare
your
whole
soul
in
the
statement
you
make
you
must
resolutely
set
down
everything
that
touches
the
matter
until
you
do
this
the
question
refuses
to
assume
its
next
shape
you
can
not
flinch
and
qualify
in
your
first
book
and
speak
plainly
in
your
second
it
is
the
act
of
utterance
that
draws
out
the
powers
in
a
man
and
makes
him
a
master
of
his
own
mind
without
the
actual
experience
of
writing
lohengrin
wagner
could
not
have
discovered
parsifal
the
works
of
men
who
are
great
enough
to
get
their
whole
thought
uttered
at
each
deliverance
form
a
progression
like
the
deductions
of
a
mathematician
these
men
are
never
satisfied
with
a
past
accomplishment
their
eyes
are
on
questions
that
beckon
to
them
from
the
horizon
their
faculties
are
replenished
with
new
energy
because
they
seek
they
are
driving
their
ploughs
through
a
sea
of
thought
intent
unresting
resourceful
creative
they
are
discoverers
and
just
to
the
extent
that
lesser
men
are
worth
anything
they
are
discoverers
too
beauty
and
elevation
flash
from
the
currents
set
up
by
intense
speculation
beauty
is
not
the
aim
of
the
writer
his
aim
must
be
truth
but
beauty
and
elevation
shine
out
of
him
while
he
is
on
the
quest
his
mind
is
on
the
problem
and
as
he
unravels
it
and
displays
it
he
communicates
his
own
spirit
as
it
were
incidentally
as
it
were
unwittingly
and
this
is
the
part
that
goes
out
from
him
and
does
his
work
in
the
world
v
principles
speech
is
a
very
small
part
of
human
intercourse
indeed
speech
is
often
not
connected
with
the
real
currents
of
intercourse
a
comic
actor
has
made
you
happy
before
he
has
uttered
a
word
this
is
by
the
responsive
vibration
of
your
apparatus
to
his
the
external
speech
and
gesture
help
the
transfer
of
power
and
that
is
all
they
do
the
communion
upon
whatever
plane
of
being
it
takes
place
is
a
contagion
and
goes
forward
by
leaps
and
darts
like
the
action
of
frost
on
a
an
angry
friend
comes
into
my
room
and
before
he
has
uttered
a
word
i
am
in
a
blaze
of
anger
a
baby
too
young
to
speak
does
some
naughty
thing
i
remonstrate
with
him
in
a
rational
way
perhaps
i
repeat
to
him
maxim
from
the
critique
of
practical
reason
the
child
understands
at
once
and
is
grateful
for
the
treatment
now
observe
this
that
if
i
said
the
same
thing
to
a
grown
man
in
the
same
tone
it
would
be
to
the
tone
and
not
to
the
argument
that
he
would
respond
the
exchange
of
energy
between
man
and
man
is
so
rapid
that
language
becomes
a
bystander
it
is
like
the
passage
of
the
electrical
current
we
receive
an
impression
or
a
message
or
twenty
messages
at
once
all
this
is
the
result
of
suggestion
and
inference
no
strange
phenomenon
is
here
alluded
to
the
situation
is
the
normal
and
constant
situation
whenever
two
human
beings
meet
the
only
mystery
about
it
is
that
our
senses
should
be
so
much
more
acute
than
we
knew
ask
a
man
to
dinner
and
talk
to
him
about
the
suez
canal
and
the
next
morning
your
wife
will
be
apt
to
give
a
truer
account
of
him
than
you
can
give
she
has
been
knitting
in
the
corner
and
thinking
about
the
best
place
to
buy
shoes
but
she
knows
which
coils
in
her
brain
have
been
played
upon
by
the
brain
of
the
stranger
the
reason
your
wife
knows
that
your
suez
friend
is
no
saint
is
that
she
feels
that
certain
strings
of
the
benevolent
harp
that
is
sounding
in
herself
are
not
being
reinforced
there
are
dead
notes
in
him
the
sensitiveness
of
children
is
so
common
a
thing
that
we
forget
its
explanation
it
is
just
because
the
child
can
not
follow
the
argument
that
he
is
free
from
the
illusion
that
the
argument
is
the
main
point
the
lobes
of
his
brain
get
a
shock
and
respond
to
it
ingenuously
these
facts
have
been
neglected
by
philosophers
because
the
facts
defy
formulation
you
can
not
get
them
into
a
statement
they
are
life
but
in
the
practical
workaday
world
they
have
always
been
understood
men
of
action
owe
their
success
to
the
habit
of
using
their
minds
and
bodies
in
a
direct
way
men
in
every
profession
rely
upon
the
accuracy
of
direct
impressions
the
great
doctor
or
the
great
general
or
the
great
business
man
uses
the
whole
of
his
sensibilities
in
each
act
of
reading
a
man
there
is
no
other
way
to
read
him
correctly
people
whose
brains
are
preoccupied
with
formulated
knowledge
are
not
apt
to
be
as
good
judges
of
character
as
spontaneous
persons
their
thoughts
are
on
logic
they
follow
what
is
said
a
very
small
fraction
of
them
is
alive
they
are
like
who
are
not
listening
to
the
opera
the
answer
to
any
question
in
psychology
always
lies
under
our
hand
we
have
only
to
ask
what
the
normal
man
does
it
will
be
found
that
he
uses
his
faculties
according
to
their
nature
though
it
may
be
he
is
embryonic
and
inarticulate
we
speak
of
great
men
as
because
they
retain
a
sensitiveness
to
immediate
impressions
very
common
in
uneducated
persons
and
in
children
their
thought
subserves
the
direct
currents
of
suggestion
their
instincts
rule
them
their
minds
serve
them
they
are
great
because
of
this
power
to
read
the
thoughts
of
others
through
the
pores
of
their
skin
and
answer
blindfold
to
unuttered
appeals
whether
of
weakness
or
of
strength
to
do
this
means
intellect
whether
in
napoleon
or
gladstone
every
pianist
and
public
speaker
every
actor
and
singer
knows
that
his
whole
art
consists
in
getting
his
intellectual
apparatus
into
focus
so
that
the
vibrations
of
his
formulated
thought
shall
correspond
and
fall
in
with
the
direct
and
spontaneous
vibrations
of
his
audience
this
is
truth
this
is
the
discovery
of
law
this
is
art
men
are
profound
and
complicated
creatures
and
when
any
one
of
them
expresses
the
laws
of
his
construction
and
reveals
his
own
natural
history
he
is
called
a
genius
but
he
is
a
genius
solely
because
he
is
comprehensible
and
others
say
of
him
am
like
his
suggestions
carry
their
extreme
subtlety
baffles
analysis
just
as
the
suggestions
of
real
life
baffle
analysis
the
miracle
of
reality
in
art
is
due
to
refinement
of
suggestion
we
can
not
follow
its
steps
or
say
how
it
is
done
we
see
only
the
idea
shakespeare
gives
you
all
the
meaning
and
none
of
the
means
this
is
artificial
communication
it
almost
competes
with
the
commonplace
familiar
transfer
of
the
incommunicable
essence
of
life
from
man
to
man
our
present
problem
is
how
to
influence
people
for
their
good
it
is
clear
that
when
you
and
another
man
meet
the
personal
equation
is
the
controlling
thing
if
you
are
more
than
he
the
way
to
influence
him
is
to
stick
to
your
own
beliefs
for
they
alone
can
keep
you
they
alone
can
make
you
vibrate
it
is
they
and
not
you
that
will
do
the
work
there
you
stand
and
there
he
stands
and
you
can
only
qualify
him
by
the
ideas
that
control
you
it
makes
no
difference
whether
you
are
an
emperor
and
he
a
peasant
or
you
a
good
government
club
man
and
he
a
merchant
the
same
forces
are
at
work
shift
your
ground
and
he
feels
the
shift
you
are
encouraging
him
to
be
shifty
like
yourself
what
can
you
do
for
him
except
to
follow
your
conscience
but
this
is
equally
true
of
every
meeting
of
all
men
everywhere
you
address
a
labor
meeting
and
talk
about
the
philippines
you
meet
the
turkish
ambassador
and
talk
about
poems
you
talk
to
your
son
about
to
each
of
these
contacts
with
mind
you
bring
the
same
power
if
you
start
with
the
psychical
value
of
no
matter
what
you
do
a
of
your
whole
activity
in
the
world
will
at
any
instant
of
time
read
it
may
be
that
a
page
of
ciphering
can
not
express
the
formula
but
it
will
mean
the
immense
amount
of
thought
that
man
has
given
during
the
last
few
thousand
years
to
his
social
arrangements
and
his
destiny
has
filled
our
minds
with
tangled
formulas
and
has
attached
our
affection
to
particular
matters
the
pomp
of
preambles
and
the
stress
of
language
stun
us
there
is
so
much
of
organized
society
there
are
so
many
good
ends
if
there
were
only
one
man
in
the
world
we
know
that
it
would
be
impossible
to
do
good
to
him
by
suggesting
evil
we
know
that
if
we
gave
him
a
hint
that
contained
both
good
and
evil
the
good
would
do
him
good
and
the
evil
evil
if
we
were
bent
on
nothing
but
benefit
we
should
have
to
confine
ourselves
to
suggestions
of
unalloyed
virtue
but
the
world
is
such
a
tangle
of
personalities
that
we
do
not
hesitate
to
mix
a
little
evil
in
the
good
we
do
hoping
that
the
evil
will
not
be
operative
we
half
believe
that
there
may
somewhere
in
the
community
be
a
hitch
in
the
multiplication
table
that
brings
out
good
for
evil
liberty
and
democracy
are
thought
to
be
such
worthy
ends
that
we
must
obtain
them
by
any
means
and
all
means
even
by
hiring
mercenaries
can
we
wonder
that
in
the
past
minds
were
staggered
by
the
importance
of
a
papacy
or
of
some
dynastic
succession
everybody
jumps
to
shield
vice
because
it
is
called
republicanism
or
democracy
the
irony
of
history
could
go
no
further
let
us
consider
our
local
reforms
by
the
light
of
these
views
civil
service
laws
elections
taxation
dissolve
all
these
into
acts
and
impulses
and
see
whether
the
laws
of
human
influence
do
not
make
a
short
cut
through
them
all
like
no
matter
what
i
talk
about
to
the
emperor
i
am
really
conveying
to
him
by
suggestion
a
tendency
to
become
as
good
or
as
bad
a
man
as
i
myself
chinese
gordon
turned
a
dynamo
of
personal
force
upon
the
orientals
and
they
understood
him
he
was
talking
religion
and
he
gave
it
to
them
straight
now
all
religion
as
everybody
knows
is
purely
a
matter
of
suggestion
but
so
is
all
other
intercourse
we
want
honesty
well
what
makes
people
honest
honesty
does
anything
else
spread
the
influence
of
honesty
except
honesty
are
we
here
facing
a
scientific
fact
is
this
a
law
of
the
transference
of
human
energy
or
is
it
not
if
it
is
you
can
not
beat
it
you
can
not
imagine
any
situation
where
your
own
total
force
in
favor
of
honesty
will
consist
of
anything
else
than
honesty
of
course
you
may
put
a
case
where
honesty
will
result
in
death
if
in
that
case
you
want
his
life
why
lie
but
what
you
will
get
will
be
his
life
not
the
spread
of
honesty
if
the
event
is
chronicled
you
will
find
it
used
as
a
means
of
justifying
dishonesty
forever
afterwards
we
do
not
want
any
of
these
reforms
except
as
a
means
of
stimulating
character
and
it
is
a
law
of
nature
that
character
can
only
be
stimulated
directly
sincerity
is
the
only
need
courage
the
virtue
we
can
dump
them
into
every
occasion
and
sleep
sound
at
night
what
interest
can
any
rational
man
have
in
our
municipal
issues
except
as
a
grindstone
on
which
to
whet
the
moral
sense
how
is
it
possible
to
deceive
ourselves
into
looking
at
our
own
political
activity
from
any
other
standpoint
than
this
you
are
to
make
a
speech
at
cooper
union
on
ballot
reform
somebody
says
not
mention
the
liquor
question
or
you
will
lose
but
some
phase
of
that
question
seems
to
you
pertinent
and
important
shall
you
omit
and
submit
that
would
be
an
odd
way
of
stimulating
character
the
need
of
the
times
is
not
ballot
laws
but
sincerity
the
maximum
that
any
man
can
do
toward
the
spread
of
sincerity
is
to
display
it
himself
all
the
virtues
spread
themselves
by
direct
propagation
and
the
vices
likewise
our
people
are
deficient
in
righteous
indignation
when
you
see
a
man
righteously
indignant
rejoice
this
is
the
seed
this
the
force
nothing
else
will
arouse
courage
but
courage
faith
but
faith
you
see
for
instance
a
knot
of
men
who
are
really
indignant
at
the
injustice
of
the
times
but
their
indignation
seems
to
you
a
danger
because
it
is
likely
to
defeat
some
candidate
some
pet
measure
of
yours
you
wish
to
allay
it
you
wish
yourself
well
rid
of
this
sacred
indignation
it
is
inconvenient
open
your
eyes
to
the
light
of
science
here
is
a
spark
of
that
fire
with
which
everybody
ought
to
be
filled
all
your
scheming
was
only
for
the
purpose
of
getting
this
fire
then
foment
it
virtue
then
is
a
mode
of
motion
or
it
is
an
attitude
of
mind
in
a
human
organism
which
enables
that
organism
to
transmit
virtue
to
others
but
vice
is
also
a
mere
attitude
of
mind
by
which
vice
is
transmitted
we
know
less
about
the
natural
history
of
vice
than
we
do
of
dipsomania
and
consumption
but
we
know
this
much
that
the
vices
are
and
breed
one
another
the
tendency
being
towards
lighter
forms
in
the
later
catchers
avoid
guilty
side
and
you
reinforce
it
sympathize
with
it
and
you
catch
his
disease
or
some
disease
i
have
held
hands
with
my
friend
who
is
in
the
wrong
over
his
family
troubles
and
it
has
given
me
the
distemper
for
a
week
the
german
actor
devrient
went
mad
while
studying
the
inmates
of
asylums
as
a
preparation
to
playing
king
lear
it
was
not
the
living
in
asylums
that
drove
him
mad
but
his
sympathetic
attitude
toward
the
disease
this
exposed
him
why
is
it
we
commend
the
man
whose
antagonism
to
crooked
work
is
so
great
that
he
shows
a
tempter
the
door
before
he
has
finished
his
proposition
parleying
is
not
only
a
danger
it
is
the
beginning
of
the
trouble
itself
it
is
very
difficult
and
very
odious
offending
people
by
forcing
them
to
see
in
which
direction
our
wheels
really
go
round
and
yet
the
alternative
is
to
have
our
machinery
forced
back
to
a
standstill
we
are
interlocked
with
other
people
and
can
not
break
free
we
are
held
in
place
by
fate
and
played
upon
against
our
will
when
you
see
cruelty
going
on
before
you
you
are
put
to
the
alternative
of
interposing
to
stop
it
or
of
losing
your
sensibility
there
is
a
law
of
growth
here
involved
it
is
inexorable
you
are
at
the
mercy
of
it
you
wish
yourself
elsewhere
but
you
are
here
you
are
a
mere
illustration
of
pitiless
and
undying
force
the
part
you
take
may
run
through
a
fit
of
bad
temper
or
malice
it
may
turn
to
covetousness
or
conceit
who
can
tell
some
poison
has
entered
your
eye
because
you
looked
negligently
upon
corruption
it
will
cost
you
some
part
of
your
sense
of
smell
or
lose
says
nature
when
she
gives
us
capacities
what
you
condone
you
support
what
you
neglect
you
confirm
it
is
true
that
your
confirmation
and
support
are
managed
through
the
mechanism
of
blindness
all
the
evil
in
the
world
receives
its
chief
support
from
the
people
whose
only
connection
with
it
is
that
they
do
not
fight
it
nor
see
it
where
politics
is
involved
scarcely
a
man
in
america
knows
the
difference
between
right
and
wrong
our
mayoralty
contest
five
years
ago
would
have
left
lot
searching
for
a
man
who
could
tell
black
from
white
it
was
a
clear
moral
issue
but
it
arose
in
politics
we
could
not
see
it
that
we
have
intellectual
cataract
is
entirely
due
to
the
habit
of
condoning
embezzlement
it
is
a
secondary
form
of
the
endemic
theft
caught
by
the
the
best
people
in
town
had
it
if
they
had
been
lifting
their
hands
against
theft
during
the
preceding
years
they
never
would
have
caught
it
of
course
we
support
all
the
good
in
the
world
as
well
as
all
the
evil
and
the
ratio
in
which
we
do
both
changes
at
every
moment
it
radiates
forth
from
us
and
is
read
correctly
by
every
baby
as
he
passes
in
his
perambulator
close
thinking
and
fresh
observation
of
things
too
familiar
to
be
noticed
bring
us
to
this
point
now
just
as
no
complexity
of
institutions
affects
the
transfer
of
virtue
so
none
affects
the
transfer
and
propagation
of
vice
yesterday
you
were
all
for
virtue
you
were
for
leading
a
revolution
against
the
bosses
and
were
ready
to
work
and
subscribe
and
vote
you
were
a
man
with
the
heart
of
a
man
but
you
are
thing
can
not
be
done
it
is
not
the
the
degradation
of
your
character
is
seen
in
your
low
spirits
and
in
the
jaded
and
sophistical
commonplaces
you
pour
forth
i
know
the
academical
reasons
for
this
change
in
you
i
can
express
it
in
terms
of
and
civil
service
but
what
is
it
that
really
has
happened
the
power
that
has
struck
you
was
focalized
the
day
before
yesterday
in
the
office
of
some
politicians
and
the
direct
rays
of
base
passion
have
struck
straight
through
stone
walls
and
constitutions
and
falling
upon
you
have
stopped
your
wheels
in
them
it
was
avarice
and
ambition
in
you
it
is
doubt
a
drowsy
inertia
overcomes
you
a
blindness
of
the
will
that
is
what
has
really
happened
the
rest
is
illusion
and
metaphysical
talk
see
now
the
real
curse
of
injustice
it
takes
away
the
sight
from
the
eyes
and
that
in
a
night
is
it
not
perfectly
natural
that
tammany
hall
should
be
everywhere
at
all
tables
in
all
churches
in
all
consciences
when
these
electrical
currents
run
between
man
and
man
and
connect
them
so
easily
i
read
in
the
newspaper
that
a
man
is
at
albany
in
the
interests
of
a
gas
deal
he
can
not
get
his
way
in
the
city
and
is
putting
up
a
job
with
the
legislature
i
see
the
thing
going
through
a
thing
utterly
cynical
utterly
corrupt
no
paper
will
explain
it
because
it
can
not
be
explained
without
names
besides
the
names
own
the
papers
everybody
understands
it
nobody
minds
it
is
any
statute
here
at
fault
will
any
legislation
cure
this
if
the
moral
sensibility
of
our
people
should
become
tensified
by
twenty
per
cent
in
hours
twenty
per
cent
of
all
our
iniquities
in
every
department
would
cease
in
hours
government
is
carried
on
by
the
lightning
of
personal
suggestion
which
flashes
through
the
community
from
day
to
day
and
from
moment
to
moment
those
things
are
done
which
are
demanded
or
are
tolerated
at
the
instant
they
are
done
i
read
in
a
newspaper
that
a
syndicate
has
been
formed
to
light
the
city
it
is
backed
by
the
men
who
control
the
city
administration
and
they
are
now
blackmailing
the
existing
company
to
its
ruin
can
i
escape
the
knowledge
of
this
thing
alas
too
easily
i
own
stock
in
it
at
first
we
think
the
legislature
makes
the
laws
then
we
see
it
is
done
by
a
cabal
then
by
people
behind
the
cabal
finally
by
the
million
bonds
of
popular
prejudice
which
tie
each
man
up
with
the
times
look
closely
take
some
particular
man
and
consider
why
it
is
that
he
does
not
spend
his
whole
time
in
fighting
for
virtue
it
will
turn
out
that
in
some
form
or
other
he
is
a
beneficiary
of
these
evils
and
has
not
the
energy
to
fight
them
one
man
depends
upon
the
for
his
living
the
next
is
held
by
affection
for
his
friends
by
the
ties
of
old
prejudice
by
inertia
by
hopelessness
which
of
them
is
the
more
deeply
injured
victim
of
tyranny
the
active
or
the
listless
man
the
tammany
boy
or
the
american
gentleman
every
man
bears
a
direct
and
discoverable
share
in
the
responsibility
a
janitor
keeps
his
place
through
tammany
influence
a
young
lawyer
gets
business
by
keeping
his
mouth
shut
follow
out
the
lines
leading
from
any
man
no
matter
how
obscure
he
is
and
they
will
lead
you
to
the
where
gigantic
business
has
its
offices
where
the
highest
functionaries
of
commerce
and
politics
meet
the
business
world
is
all
one
organization
it
is
a
sort
of
secret
society
a
great
web
no
matter
where
you
touch
it
the
same
spiders
come
out
the
boss
system
then
appears
as
the
visible
part
of
all
the
private
selfishness
in
america
it
is
a
great
religion
of
with
its
hierarchy
its
chapels
its
propaganda
and
its
confessors
in
every
home
you
yourself
support
it
i
saw
last
week
at
your
table
a
magnate
whose
business
conduct
you
deplore
and
i
heard
a
young
man
make
the
comment
that
there
was
no
use
fighting
the
current
so
long
as
social
influence
could
be
bought
do
not
accuse
tammany
hall
you
yourself
have
corrupted
that
young
man
so
long
as
you
think
you
can
circumvent
the
laws
of
force
you
will
remain
a
pillar
in
the
temple
of
iniquity
but
look
closer
still
at
each
of
those
individuals
and
see
just
what
it
is
he
is
giving
as
the
purchase
money
one
man
gives
to
pay
a
private
debts
and
goes
as
minister
to
england
another
gives
merely
his
name
to
indorse
a
doubtful
candidate
for
the
assembly
and
receives
prospective
good
will
from
the
organization
what
is
this
great
market
overt
where
every
one
can
get
what
he
wants
the
syndicate
can
get
the
franchises
and
the
aldermen
the
cash
no
one
is
too
small
to
be
served
or
so
great
as
to
require
nothing
upon
what
principle
is
this
monstrous
bazaar
this
for
conducted
it
is
as
large
as
the
united
states
the
transcontinental
railroads
use
it
and
so
well
managed
that
i
can
get
my
friend
a
job
as
the
secretary
of
a
reform
movement
what
is
it
that
makes
this
universal
shop
run
so
smoothly
it
is
hooked
together
simply
on
business
principles
the
price
you
pay
is
always
the
rubbing
of
somebody
the
right
way
the
thing
you
get
is
advancement
or
personal
comfort
of
some
sort
it
has
happened
that
by
the
operation
of
commercial
forces
the
whole
of
seventy
million
people
have
been
polarized
into
and
our
total
condition
is
visibly
vanity
fair
you
can
actually
follow
the
rays
of
power
from
the
individual
to
the
boss
all
the
evil
in
the
world
is
seen
to
be
in
league
embezzlement
and
laziness
selfish
ambition
and
prejudice
cruelty
and
timidity
here
openly
play
into
each
hands
support
and
console
each
other
nay
every
atom
of
vice
every
impulse
of
malice
or
cupidity
can
be
shown
up
as
a
tendon
or
a
sinew
of
the
great
organization
of
selfish
forces
it
is
as
if
a
magic
glass
had
been
superposed
upon
the
continent
and
looking
down
through
it
upon
the
motives
of
men
all
complexity
vanished
and
we
saw
all
the
evil
forces
pulling
one
way
the
same
thing
has
always
been
true
in
every
society
but
the
names
powers
superstitions
have
been
so
extremely
complicated
that
no
one
could
follow
the
laws
of
interlocking
motive
except
by
inference
and
prophetic
insight
take
the
case
of
a
very
selfish
man
fighting
his
way
up
through
society
in
the
reign
of
louis
xviii
he
meets
a
bourbon
influence
an
ecclesiastical
influence
a
napoleonic
influence
a
republican
influence
he
grapples
with
every
man
he
meets
using
the
hooks
of
in
that
man
the
forces
at
work
under
louis
xviii
were
as
simple
as
with
us
only
the
nomenclature
is
different
and
more
complex
it
is
easy
in
america
to
see
the
working
of
one
selfishness
upon
let
alone
the
market
overt
it
is
easy
to
trace
the
subtle
social
relations
when
they
are
for
the
bad
it
was
easy
to
follow
the
effect
of
your
conduct
in
asking
the
dishonest
business
magnate
to
dinner
because
the
young
man
spoke
of
it
he
was
shocked
and
injured
but
we
also
found
out
by
the
episode
that
before
you
did
the
thing
you
were
really
a
factor
for
good
in
his
life
holding
up
his
conscience
and
his
ideals
the
inexpressible
subtlety
in
the
mechanism
of
man
makes
the
transmission
of
the
force
for
good
as
easy
as
that
of
the
force
for
evil
they
are
of
the
same
character
and
very
often
flow
through
the
same
channels
there
is
no
more
mystery
in
the
one
case
than
in
the
other
consider
what
is
done
in
the
course
of
any
practical
movement
for
reform
a
bad
bill
is
pending
at
albany
in
order
to
beat
it
a
party
of
men
whose
characters
are
trusted
get
on
a
train
and
the
whole
state
watches
them
proceed
to
albany
this
is
often
enough
to
defeat
a
measure
the
good
their
pilgrimage
does
is
done
then
and
there
instantly
by
example
by
suggestion
if
when
they
get
to
albany
they
sell
out
their
cause
the
harm
they
do
is
done
then
and
there
by
example
by
suggestion
they
make
some
concession
which
lessens
friction
but
suggests
tammany
hall
this
is
the
only
part
of
the
transaction
that
reaches
the
great
public
ask
the
laboring
man
and
he
will
give
you
a
digest
of
the
whole
episode
in
a
shrug
if
a
reform
candidate
is
running
on
the
platform
shalt
not
steal
and
the
boss
desires
to
corrupt
him
the
boss
asks
him
to
drop
in
for
a
chat
if
he
goes
every
one
hears
of
it
the
next
day
and
every
one
is
a
little
corrupted
himself
a
thousand
men
say
he
did
right
had
he
resisted
these
same
men
would
have
cried
and
thereafter
taken
a
higher
view
of
human
nature
it
is
by
a
succession
of
such
minute
shocks
of
good
or
bad
example
that
communities
are
affected
the
truth
seems
to
be
that
our
lives
are
ruled
by
laws
of
influence
which
are
in
themselves
exceedingly
direct
but
the
operation
of
them
is
concealed
from
us
by
our
preoccupation
over
details
it
is
impossible
to
regard
these
matters
in
too
simple
a
light
nothing
is
ever
involved
except
the
contagious
impulse
that
makes
one
man
yawn
when
he
sees
another
man
yawn
both
the
good
and
the
evil
in
the
world
run
upon
the
winds
habit
of
falling
upon
his
face
before
the
congregation
and
calling
god
to
witness
that
he
could
lead
them
no
longer
was
not
a
political
trick
done
to
frighten
the
people
into
submission
by
the
threat
of
abandoning
them
it
was
a
sincere
act
of
devotion
but
it
was
also
the
most
powerful
form
of
appeal
he
did
the
act
they
followed
in
it
and
thus
made
him
absolute
anecdotes
and
fables
consisted
of
nothing
but
suggestion
they
were
one
source
of
his
power
the
first
thing
a
tyrant
does
is
to
suppress
cartoons
here
we
have
something
that
is
often
sheer
pantomime
and
yet
it
is
one
of
the
most
effective
vehicles
in
the
world
it
was
the
only
thing
platt
could
not
stand
within
two
years
he
has
tried
to
stop
it
by
legislation
if
you
are
to
reach
masses
of
people
in
this
world
you
must
do
it
by
a
sign
language
whether
your
vehicle
be
commerce
literature
or
politics
you
can
do
nothing
but
raise
signals
and
make
motions
to
the
people
in
literature
this
is
obvious
the
more
any
truth
is
the
shorter
grow
its
hieroglyphics
the
great
truths
can
only
be
given
in
hints
phrases
and
parables
they
lie
in
universal
experience
and
any
comment
belittles
them
they
are
like
the
magnetic
poles
that
can
only
be
pointed
out
with
a
needle
take
any
profound
saying
about
life
and
see
if
it
does
not
imply
a
sort
of
telegraphy
as
the
ordinary
means
of
communication
between
men
that
loseth
his
life
shall
save
here
we
have
a
poem
a
system
of
ethics
and
a
psychology
or
take
any
bit
of
worldly
wisdom
here
we
have
the
whole
philosophy
of
materialism
does
any
one
imagine
that
political
bargains
are
reduced
to
writing
it
would
be
injurious
to
the
conscience
they
are
made
by
the
merest
hints
on
all
sides
every
one
is
left
free
the
extreme
case
of
the
power
of
suggestion
is
seen
in
the
where
a
rumor
that
banker
a
has
dined
with
railroad
president
b
drives
values
up
or
down
venezuela
message
makes
a
panic
the
different
parts
of
the
financial
world
live
from
day
to
day
in
instantaneous
and
throbbing
communication
this
is
one
side
of
the
popular
life
its
thermometer
is
sensitive
and
records
one
thousandth
of
a
degree
as
readily
as
the
political
thermometer
records
a
single
degree
but
the
principle
is
the
same
all
the
people
run
the
and
all
the
people
run
politics
there
has
never
been
any
difficulty
in
reaching
the
whole
people
with
ideas
even
a
private
man
can
do
it
but
he
must
act
them
out
vi
principles
suppose
a
small
child
steals
jam
in
the
pantry
so
long
as
he
pretends
that
he
did
not
do
it
or
did
not
know
it
was
wrong
he
suffers
a
certain
oppression
you
can
explain
to
an
intelligent
child
that
if
he
tells
the
whole
truth
about
the
thing
the
telling
will
cost
him
pain
and
leave
him
happy
but
you
can
not
save
him
the
pain
so
long
as
he
persists
in
lying
some
of
his
faculties
lie
under
an
inhibition
the
vital
energies
flow
past
them
instead
of
through
them
the
first
shock
of
a
through
passage
gives
a
spasm
of
pain
and
then
the
child
is
happy
it
is
one
of
the
facts
of
the
world
that
moral
awakening
is
accompanied
by
pain
the
quarrel
that
the
world
has
with
its
agitators
is
that
they
do
really
agitate
people
express
this
by
saying
that
the
men
are
dangerous
or
have
bad
taste
the
epithets
vary
with
the
age
they
are
intended
to
excite
public
contempt
and
they
embody
the
aversions
of
society
in
a
martial
age
the
reformer
is
called
a
in
a
commercial
age
an
incompetent
a
disturber
of
values
in
a
fanatical
age
a
heretic
if
an
agitator
is
not
reviled
he
is
a
quack
these
epithets
are
mere
figures
of
speech
what
they
really
express
is
suffering
caused
by
the
workings
of
conscience
and
so
in
any
educational
movement
that
runs
across
the
country
there
is
always
a
track
of
pain
turning
to
happiness
when
we
get
in
the
path
of
one
of
these
things
we
find
that
the
division
between
contending
ideas
passes
through
the
individual
man
it
does
not
fall
between
men
the
struggle
is
always
the
struggle
of
forces
within
an
individual
a
is
trying
to
convince
b
the
struggle
in
mind
is
to
make
the
matter
clear
in
mind
to
make
the
opposite
clear
in
the
course
of
time
one
view
prevails
but
the
struggle
continues
for
b
occupies
position
and
is
now
struggling
to
convince
it
is
in
this
way
that
a
movement
runs
through
a
community
the
firing
line
passes
through
a
series
of
individuals
and
as
they
succumb
through
them
to
the
next
if
you
take
any
particular
case
of
conflict
you
will
find
that
the
man
is
divided
between
two
courses
one
of
which
is
disagreeable
because
it
involves
effort
and
sacrifice
and
offence
the
other
is
agreeable
because
it
involves
personal
ease
or
personal
advancement
the
two
motives
in
man
result
from
the
structure
of
his
brain
whose
operations
we
are
obliged
to
accept
we
can
not
amend
them
they
are
the
facts
of
psychology
it
would
seem
as
if
the
brain
of
man
were
so
constituted
that
at
the
moment
of
its
full
operation
the
man
himself
disappears
his
consciousness
becomes
wholly
occupied
with
impersonal
interests
thus
in
the
process
of
thought
a
man
begins
to
see
his
own
personal
interests
threatened
if
he
continues
to
think
they
must
vanish
this
is
the
struggle
between
right
and
wrong
it
is
really
a
struggle
between
two
attitudes
of
mind
it
is
the
experience
we
suffer
when
the
mind
is
passing
from
the
to
the
attitude
perhaps
the
discomfort
of
doing
duty
is
an
inseparable
incident
of
the
storage
of
energy
and
the
pleasure
of
neglecting
duty
an
incident
of
the
leakage
of
energy
when
i
get
up
and
poke
the
fire
because
i
see
it
will
go
out
if
i
i
return
to
my
chair
a
more
energetic
being
than
i
was
the
moment
before
at
any
rate
our
oscillation
between
two
states
of
consciousness
has
preoccupied
mankind
from
the
earliest
times
and
has
given
rise
to
all
the
dualistic
philosophies
the
great
fact
as
to
the
reality
of
the
struggle
is
proved
to
us
not
merely
by
our
own
consciousness
but
because
we
can
see
the
logical
results
of
it
everywhere
in
society
a
community
is
a
collection
of
palpitating
animals
each
of
us
is
one
of
them
and
each
of
us
receives
and
transmits
millions
of
impressions
hourly
we
get
heard
we
have
our
exact
weight
and
force
there
is
no
difficulty
about
our
power
of
intercourse
indeed
it
is
the
thing
we
can
not
get
away
from
no
man
walks
by
himself
between
his
feet
and
the
ground
are
invisible
pedals
that
play
upon
and
are
played
upon
by
other
men
you
can
not
live
or
move
except
by
transmitting
influence
the
whole
of
practical
life
is
made
up
of
contact
with
the
passions
of
others
a
lawyer
or
a
broker
is
like
an
engineer
who
sits
behind
his
machine
managing
its
levers
and
its
stopcocks
a
trader
a
writer
or
a
philanthropist
a
laborer
or
a
clergyman
does
nothing
but
open
and
shut
valves
in
other
people
there
is
no
other
way
of
serving
your
fellows
there
is
no
other
way
of
earning
your
living
or
of
wasting
your
substance
we
saw
that
in
politics
it
was
impossible
to
draw
a
dividing
line
anywhere
in
that
series
of
men
whose
joint
activity
and
inactivity
held
up
what
we
call
the
evils
of
politics
money
interest
shaded
off
into
prejudice
and
that
into
mistaken
loyalty
and
that
into
indifference
the
striking
truth
about
the
whole
series
was
that
it
showed
different
shades
of
selfishness
lack
of
energy
and
inability
to
use
the
mind
accurately
so
also
any
unselfish
or
accurate
use
of
his
mind
by
the
laborer
or
by
the
journalist
was
as
we
saw
apt
to
throw
him
out
of
employment
in
politics
and
in
morals
all
that
we
condemn
turns
out
on
inspection
to
be
mere
selfishness
but
anything
in
the
world
that
we
dislike
turns
out
on
inspection
to
be
effort
or
avoidance
of
effort
bad
art
may
show
the
gross
selfishness
of
the
or
the
refined
laziness
of
prejudice
or
the
mere
weakness
that
was
unable
to
see
the
world
for
itself
and
has
been
forced
to
see
it
with
some
one
eyes
it
is
a
makeshift
so
of
bad
carpentry
or
bad
cooking
there
is
no
such
special
province
in
life
as
morality
each
man
regards
that
thing
as
immoral
which
he
sees
to
be
selfish
a
proofreader
will
show
the
same
indignation
over
a
careless
job
that
a
musician
shows
over
a
weak
phrasing
the
unimaginable
subtlety
of
our
comprehension
enables
us
to
detect
selfishness
in
arts
of
whose
methods
we
know
nothing
we
read
it
like
large
print
to
speak
accurately
all
we
get
from
any
communication
is
a
transcript
an
image
a
picture
of
the
thought
the
jar
of
intellect
and
character
is
it
supposed
that
communication
between
men
goes
forward
by
ratiocination
or
that
education
is
a
thing
taken
in
by
linear
measurement
thought
can
not
creep
but
only
fly
it
proceeds
by
the
magic
of
stimulation
a
good
judge
can
read
a
good
brief
almost
as
fast
as
he
can
turn
the
pages
if
a
thing
is
well
put
it
is
almost
our
own
before
it
is
said
ideas
pass
into
us
so
quickly
that
plato
thought
we
knew
them
in
a
former
existence
this
is
due
to
the
subtlety
of
our
apprehension
we
are
not
satisfied
except
by
an
appeal
so
refined
that
our
only
sensation
is
one
of
being
made
more
alive
ne
me
was
highest
praise
what
wonder
then
that
we
resent
the
of
any
inferior
mind
the
whole
of
life
is
no
more
than
a
series
of
pulsations
and
all
the
books
and
bibles
and
telegraph
wires
are
the
machinery
by
which
in
one
way
or
another
the
mind
of
man
touches
the
mind
of
man
the
world
has
been
going
on
for
so
long
that
we
have
many
such
devices
and
out
of
the
millions
that
have
been
made
all
but
the
very
best
get
discarded
as
old
lumber
these
things
are
the
language
of
the
unselfish
force
upon
the
globe
it
is
much
nearer
truth
to
think
of
them
as
a
single
influence
than
as
multifarious
their
origin
and
tendency
their
practical
utility
the
veneration
in
which
they
are
held
bind
them
together
and
make
them
one
for
the
world
values
the
seer
above
all
men
and
has
always
done
so
nay
it
values
all
men
in
proportion
as
they
partake
of
the
character
of
seers
the
elgin
marbles
and
a
decision
of
john
marshall
are
valued
for
the
same
reason
what
we
feel
in
them
is
a
painstaking
submission
to
facts
beyond
the
control
and
to
ideas
imposed
upon
him
by
his
vision
so
with
symphonies
with
adam
of
nations
with
any
conceivable
output
of
the
human
mind
of
which
you
approve
you
love
them
because
you
say
things
were
not
made
they
were
thus
the
forces
of
an
unselfish
sort
upon
the
globe
are
cumulative
the
dead
heroes
fight
on
forever
and
the
dead
mathematicians
expound
forever
it
is
true
that
the
organization
of
the
selfish
forces
is
overwhelmingly
visible
and
that
of
the
unselfish
ones
invisible
napoleon
is
seen
by
his
contemporaries
spinoza
is
not
seen
the
reason
is
simple
the
man
who
wants
something
must
have
an
office
address
but
the
man
who
wants
nothing
for
himself
but
spends
his
whole
time
in
so
using
his
mind
that
he
himself
disappears
lives
only
as
an
influence
in
the
minds
of
others
he
is
a
song
a
theory
a
proposition
in
algebra
these
two
conflicting
forms
of
force
are
then
flashed
up
and
down
forward
and
back
ceaselessly
through
and
across
every
social
meeting
through
and
across
society
the
novelists
and
playwrights
deal
with
this
instantaneous
interplay
of
motive
and
the
analysis
of
self
for
self
on
the
side
and
sacrifice
for
principle
on
the
side
is
a
true
thing
it
is
a
fair
abstract
of
the
world
you
can
illustrate
in
an
instant
the
immediacy
of
these
two
hierarchies
of
power
under
which
we
live
and
from
which
we
can
not
escape
the
selfish
ones
need
not
be
named
they
oppress
us
but
the
unselfish
ones
are
equally
near
if
you
take
any
bit
of
poetry
or
speech
or
writing
that
you
consider
great
and
examine
it
you
will
find
that
it
illustrates
the
logical
coherence
of
all
the
ideas
and
feelings
that
make
you
happy
it
is
a
digest
of
a
law
of
influence
or
conversely
if
you
set
about
to
illustrate
some
experience
and
if
you
can
get
it
profoundly
and
accurately
stated
as
what
you
believe
to
be
the
bottom
truth
it
will
turn
under
your
hands
into
something
familiar
if
you
are
successful
it
will
be
a
kind
of
poetry
vii
conclusion
there
is
force
enough
in
ordinary
sunshine
to
turn
all
the
mills
in
the
world
and
there
is
beneficent
energy
enough
in
any
community
to
make
the
people
perfectly
happy
but
it
is
cramped
and
deflected
poisoned
by
misuse
and
turned
to
hateful
ends
the
question
is
how
to
liberate
energy
people
are
fond
of
thinking
the
millennium
is
impossible
but
so
long
as
happiness
is
dependent
on
a
right
use
of
the
faculties
there
is
no
reason
why
the
millennium
should
not
be
reached
and
that
soon
or
unexpectedly
we
all
know
individuals
so
harmoniously
framed
that
we
say
theirs
were
the
common
temper
of
mankind
we
should
be
none
of
the
externals
of
life
about
which
there
is
so
much
buffeting
control
the
question
happiness
is
in
a
nutshell
anybody
can
have
it
you
are
happy
if
you
get
out
of
bed
on
the
right
side
i
can
never
stop
wondering
at
the
awful
simplicity
of
the
principle
on
which
mankind
is
constructed

not
reach
the
porch
till
she
turned
her
back
on

and
walked
straight
into

door
renounce
the
search
for
happiness
and
you
find
the
substance
there
is
nothing
else
in
the
law
and
the
prophets
we
see
most
men
like
spinning
to
the
left
and
leading
a
dismal
life
how
shall
we
get
their
motive
power
to
spin
them
to
the
right
and
make
them
happy
the
practical
question
is
how
to
use
the
power
of
sunlight
to
turn
our
mills
how
can
we
hold
up
a
prism
to
the
times
that
shall
disintegrate
these
rays
of
complex
force
and
then
adjust
a
lens
that
shall
focus
the
powers
of
good
and
make
them
turn
the
wheels
of
society
the
elements
are
before
us
ceaselessly
in
motion

the
most
adamantine
institutions
are

there
is

if
you
have
a
steady

you
will
see
that
the

is

nor
are

the

and
are
governed
by

as

all
these
are

there
is
no
one
of
them

the
ordinary
modes

chief
among
them
you
find
the
great
machinery
of
government
it
dwarfs
every
other
agency
whether
for
good
or
ill
in
america
this
machinery
was
designed
to
be
at
the
service
of
anybody
it
is
an
advertising
agency
for
ideas
and
it
is
very
much
more
than
this
since
the
fact
that
a
man
is
to
vote
forces
him
to
think
you
may
preach
to
a
congregation
by
the
year
and
not
affect
its
thought
because
it
is
not
called
upon
for
definite
action
but
throw
your
subject
into
a
campaign
and
it
becomes
a
challenge
you
can
get
assent
to
almost
any
proposition
so
long
as
you
are
not
going
to
do
anything
about
it
and
on
the
other
hand
no
amount
of
verbal
proof
will
justify
a
new
thought
until
it
has
been
put
in
practice
alas
for
ink
and
paper
there
is
in
all
speech
and
writing
a
conventional
presumption
that
human
beings
shall
be
logical
or
fixed
quantities
or
at
least
coherent
creatures
for
the
purposes
of
an
essay
or
a
speech
you
prove
your
case
and
carry
weight
accordingly
if
you
are
very
cogent
and
conclusive
why
you
win
hurrah
the
world
is
saved
but
in
real
life
there
are
no
fixed
quantities
all
the
terms
are
variables
for
example
everybody
understands
what
is
meant
by
the
people
differ
only
as
to
the
application
of
that
law
not
long
ago
i
heard
a
sermon
on
this
law
in
which
great
stress
was
laid
on
the
fact
that
it
was
a
discovered
law
whereby
the
truth
prevailed
any
truce
with
evil
meant
defeat
for
the
cause
of
righteousness
this
was
the
law
of
god
tested
by
experience
and
in
constant
operation
like
the
law
of
gravity
a
thing
you
could
not
escape
the
preacher
pictured
the
solitary
struggle
of
the
great
man
seeking
truth
his
proclamation
of
the
truth
the
refusal
of
the
world
to
receive
it
and
the
isolation
and
apparent
failure
nevertheless
what
the
prophet
said
had
always
the
same
content
it
was
an
appeal
to
the
instincts
of
man
upon
the
question
of
right
and
wrong
and
in
the
end
it
was
accepted
now
the
man
who
made
this
exposition
and
it
was
admirable
is
in
regard
to
politics
a
believer
in
compromise
i
think
i
have
never
known
him
support
the
idealist
cause
in
a
campaign
and
upon
most
occasions
of
crisis
he
is
found
heartily
throwing
stones
at
the
crusaders
what
words
in
any
language
can
make
this
man
understand
that
his
law
which
he
really
does
profoundly
understand
as
a
law
applies
to
reform
movements
why
no
words
will
do
it
only
example
new
statements
about
morality
however
eloquent
add
nothing
to
our
knowledge
everything
is
known
about
the
moral
law
except
how
you
yourself
will
act
under
given
circumstances
you
have
nothing
but
example
to
contribute
people
interrogate
force
they
are
unconvinced
and
are
carried
still
protesting
through
the
air
and
deposited
in
a
new
place
and
then
thereafter
they
agree
with
you
about
the
whole
matter
mere
intellectual
assent
to
your
proposition
is
even
when
you
can
get
it
worth
nothing
your
object
is
not
to
confute
but
to
stimulate
what
you
really
want
is
that
every
man
you
meet
shall
drop
his
business
and
devote
his
entire
life
and
energy
to
your
cause
you
will
accept
nothing
less
than
this
is
it
not
clear
that
people
are
not
moved
by
logic
your
conduct
must
ultimately
square
with
reason
and
be
justified
by
the
laws
of
the
universe
and
the
constitution
of
other
minds
but
you
must
value
only
that
approval
which
comes
from
the
deeper
fibres
in
men
you
need
not
be
concerned
about
the
bickerings
of
contemporary
misunderstanding
leave
these
for
the
historical
society
act
first
explain
afterwards
that
is
the
way
to
get
heard
must
you
show
your
passport
and
certificate
of
birth
and
legitimacy
to
every
editor
and
every
lackey
find
out
who
you
are
by
and
by
it
is
easier
to
knock
a
man
down
than
to
say
why
you
do
it
the
act
is
sometimes
needed
and
wisdom
then
approves
it
after
the
event
people
who
love
soft
methods
and
hate
iniquity
forget
this
that
reform
consists
in
taking
a
bone
from
a
dog
philosophy
will
not
do
it
such
are
the
practical
dictates
of
agitation
their
justification
lies
always
with
events
it
may
be
that
you
must
wait
seven
centuries
for
an
audience
or
it
may
be
that
in
two
years
your
voice
will
be
heeded
if
you
are
really
a
forerunner
of
better
times
the
times
will
appear
and
explain
you
it
will
then
turn
out
that
your
movement
was
the
keynote
of
the
national
life
you
really
differed
from
your
neighbors
only
in
this
that
your
mind
had
gone
faster
than
theirs
along
the
road
all
were
travelling
we
are
all
slaves
of
the
age
we
can
only
see
such
principles
as
society
reveals
the
philosophy
of
other
ages
does
us
little
good
we
repeat
the
old
formulas
and
cry
up
the
prophets
but
we
see
no
connection
between
the
truth
we
know
so
well
in
print
and
its
counterpart
in
real
life
the
moral
commonplaces
as
for
instance
is
the
best
policy
single
just
man
can
influence
an
entire
community
compromise
a
principle
are
social
truths
they
are
always
true
but
they
are
only
obviously
true
in
very
virtuous
communities
in
a
vile
community
the
influence
of
a
just
man
is
potent
but
not
visible
in
a
perfectly
virtuous
era
it
is
clear
that
a
cheat
could
not
drive
a
fraudulent
trade
a
seer
is
a
man
with
such
sharp
eyes
for
cause
and
effect
that
he
sees
social
truth
even
under
unfavorable
conditions
and
yet
even
the
seers
generally
had
auspicious
weather
that
is
to
say
storms
of
moral
passion
the
whole
race
of
jews
lived
in
fervent
exaltation
for
generations
and
revealed
to
their
prophets
deep
glimpses
of
social
truth
hence
the
bible
prophet
is
not
without
honor
save
in
his
own
what
happy
precision
what
sound
generalization
but
every
township
in
israel
had
its
prophet
and
the
truth
was
a
commonplace
all
the
moral
wisdom
would
turn
into
literal
truth
upon
the
regeneration
of
society
it
tends
to
become
obvious
in
regenerative
eras
in
dark
ages
it
becomes
paradox
standards
are
multiplied
and
makeshift
theories
come
in
one
rule
for
social
conduct
another
for
business
another
for
politics
expedient
supplants
principle
indeed
you
may
gauge
the
degradation
of
an
age
by
the
multiplicity
of
its
standards
it
is
the
same
with
the
fine
arts
to
the
men
that
made
the
statues
and
the
pictures
these
things
were
the
shortest
symbols
of
truth
and
required
no
explanation
in
the
dark
ages
that
followed
they
became
a
mystery
and
a
paradox
but
the
traditions
and
objects
survived
and
had
to
be
accounted
for
an
age
that
can
not
produce
them
requires
a
philosophy
of
æsthetics
thus
a
thousand
reasons
are
given
to
explain
their
existence
and
finally
it
is
agreed
that
they
are
something
superfluous
and
fictitious
conventional
lies
like
poetry
like
loving
your
neighbor
nothing
but
a
general
increase
of
interest
in
the
aspect
of
common
things
would
explain
to
us
the
great
masters
a
revival
of
interest
in
the
way
the
world
looks
is
the
precursor
of
painting
the
perceptions
of
every
one
are
quickening
and
so
we
may
be
sure
that
we
are
upon
the
edge
of
a
better
era
when
the
old
moral
commonplaces
begin
to
glow
like
jewels
and
the
stones
to
testify
you
can
not
expect
any
one
but
a
scientist
to
be
startled
at
the
movement
of
a
glacier
but
if
you
distribute
a
few
micrometric
instruments
upon
that
gloomy
the
american
civic
consciousness
and
if
you
take
observations
not
oftener
than
once
in
three
years
you
will
be
startled
the
direction
of
the
general
movement
is
absolutely
right
but
it
all
moves
together
special
signs
of
progress
imply
general
progress
and
hence
comes
the
extraordinary
and
scientific
interest
in
the
awakening
of
this
community
it
is
like
a
man
lapsed
into
the
deepest
coma
who
is
beginning
to
stir
watch
him
take
his
pulse
surround
him
with
every
apparatus
of
experimental
physiology
and
you
will
find
the
laws
of
health
the
norm
of
progress
art
and
literature
and
that
moral
atmosphere
which
makes
a
society
worth
moving
in
lie
on
the
other
side
of
the
great
reaction
the
spiritual
revival
which
we
see
now
faintly
beginning
and
it
is
because
these
things
can
be
got
at
only
by
stimulating
american
character
that
these
reform
movements
are
of
value
here
at
least
the
circulation
throbs
political
reform
that
is
to
say
a
political
life
in
which
men
who
are
personally
honest
predominate
a
politics
run
by
ideas
will
come
in
as
fast
as
the
public
develops
ideas
and
not
before
but
an
idea
is
something
very
different
from
what
you
who
read
this
think
it
is
an
idea
is
a
thing
that
governs
your
conduct
all
the
time
for
instance
you
assent
to
the
notion
of
independence
in
politics
you
understand
the
theory
but
you
vote
the
ticket
why
you
want
to
get
out
of
your
class
the
relations
between
thought
and
action
in
you
are
not
normal
half
of
your
brain
has
never
functioned
and
the
paralysis
shows
in
your
politics
you
have
no
idea
it
is
not
this
sort
of
idea
that
expels
rascals
or
makes
books
or
music
what
passes
for
political
thought
in
your
vocabulary
is
like
the
phantasma
in
the
brain
of
the
indian
priest
who
is
buried
with
the
corn
growing
above
him
the
average
educated
man
in
america
has
about
as
much
knowledge
of
what
a
political
idea
is
as
he
has
of
the
principles
of
counterpoint
each
is
a
thing
used
in
politics
or
music
which
those
fellows
who
practise
politics
or
music
manipulate
somehow
show
him
one
and
he
will
deny
that
it
is
politics
at
all
it
must
be
corrupt
or
he
will
not
recognize
it
he
has
only
seen
dried
figs
he
has
only
thought
dried
thoughts
a
live
thought
or
a
real
idea
is
against
the
rules
of
his
mind
imagine
a
of
discussing
dante
they
dote
on
his
style
his
passion
his
force
his
quality
in
walks
dante
grim
remorseless
harsh
powerful
the
man
represents
everything
they
hate
he
is
a
horror
and
an
outrage
the
whole
region
of
literature
that
these
men
live
in
is
not
more
fictitious
than
the
region
of
political
thought
in
which
the
effete
american
i
mean
your
banker
your
college
president
your
writer
of
editorial
leaders
lives
exclude
for
the
moment
those
who
are
financially
corrupt
and
consider
only
the
men
of
intellect
and
in
all
that
concerns
politics
they
are
as
removed
from
real
ideas
as
rossetti
was
removed
from
the
real
dante
imagine
a
company
of
people
on
a
voyage
they
play
whist
with
one
another
for
dimes
and
they
spend
all
their
money
on
the
steward
and
continue
to
play
with
counters
and
the
ship
goes
to
wreck
and
they
sit
on
the
beach
and
continue
to
play
with
pebbles
that
is
american
politics
the
whole
thing
is
one
gigantic
sham
one
transcendent
fraud
it
makes
no
difference
which
man
is
made
president
it
makes
no
difference
which
is
governor
there
is
no
choice
between
mckinley
and
bryan
between
republicanism
and
democracy
there
is
no
difference
between
them
they
are
one
thing
they
both
and
all
of
them
are
part
of
the
machinery
by
which
the
government
of
a
most
dishonest
nation
is
carried
on
for
the
financial
benefit
of
certain
parties
certain
thousands
of
men
who
have
bank
accounts
and
eat
and
drink
and
bring
up
their
families
on
the
proceeds
of
this
complicated
swindle
there
is
no
reality
in
a
single
phrase
uttered
in
politics
no
meaning
in
one
single
word
of
any
of
it
there
is
no
man
in
public
life
who
stands
for
anything
they
are
shadows
they
are
phantasmagoria
at
best
they
cater
to
the
better
elements
at
worst
they
frankly
subserve
the
worst
there
is
no
one
who
stands
for
his
own
ideas
himself
by
himself
a
man
if
american
politics
does
not
look
to
you
like
a
joke
a
tragic
dance
if
you
have
enough
blindness
left
in
you
on
any
plea
on
any
excuse
to
vote
for
the
democratic
party
or
the
republican
party
for
at
present
machine
and
party
are
one
or
for
any
candidate
who
does
not
stand
for
a
new
era
then
you
yourself
pass
into
the
slide
of
the
you
are
an
exhibit
a
quaint
product
a
curiosity
of
the
american
soil
you
are
part
of
the
problem
and
you
must
be
educated
and
drawn
forward
towards
real
life
this
process
is
going
on
as
the
community
returns
to
life
it
sees
the
natural
world
for
a
moment
and
then
forgets
it
the
blood
flushes
the
brain
and
then
recedes
you
yourself
voted
once
against
both
parties
when
you
thought
you
could
win
and
when
you
were
excited
you
quoted
isaiah
and
i
know
not
what
poetry
and
were
out
and
out
committed
to
principle
but
you
are
cold
and
hopeless
at
present
hope
is
a
mystery
to
you
nevertheless
the
utility
of
those
early
reform
movements
survives
they
heated
the
imagination
of
the
people
till
the
people
had
a
momentary
vision
of
truths
which
not
all
of
them
forgot
and
so
each
year
the
temperature
has
been
higher
the
mind
of
the
community
clearer
we
must
not
regard
those
broken
reeds
the
renegade
leaders
of
reform
movements
as
villains
though
the
mere
record
of
their
words
and
conduct
might
prove
them
such
they
have
been
men
emerging
from
a
mist
they
see
clearly
for
a
moment
and
then
clouds
sweep
before
them
vanity
selfishness
ambition
tradition
habit
intervene
like
a
fog
they
have
been
betrayed
too
by
the
fickle
public
that
would
not
stand
by
them
when
in
trouble
in
the
recapture
of
any
institution
by
the
forces
of
honesty
there
are
trenches
that
get
filled
by
slaughtered
honor
this
whole
revolution
means
the
invasion
of
politics
by
new
men
at
first
they
are
tyros
unstable
untried
fellows
half
of
them
crack
in
the
baking
but
there
are
more
coming
and
the
fibre
is
growing
tougher
and
the
eyes
clearer
soon
we
shall
have
men
a
great
passion
is
soon
to
replace
the
feeble
conscientious
motive
that
has
hitherto
brought
the
new
men
forward
ambition
the
ambition
to
stand
for
ideas
for
ideas
only
and
to
get
heard
we
have
almost
forgotten
that
public
life
is
the
natural
ambition
of
every
young
man
conditions
have
made
it
contemptible
but
these
struggles
signify
that
a
change
in
those
conditions
has
already
begun
your
work
and
mine
may
be
summed
up
in
one
word
make
it
possible
for
a
young
man
to
go
into
public
life
untarnished
and
as
an
enemy
to
every
extant
evil
you
must
have
men
who
will
not
go
except
on
these
terms
the
times
herald
such
men
they
will
appear
we
must
prepare
for
them
the
reason
for
the
slow
progress
of
the
world
seems
to
lie
in
a
single
fact
every
man
is
born
under
the
yoke
and
grows
up
beneath
the
oppressions
of
his
age
he
can
only
get
a
vision
of
the
unselfish
forces
in
the
world
by
appealing
to
them
and
every
appeal
is
a
call
to
arms
if
he
fights
he
must
fight
not
one
man
but
a
conspiracy
he
is
always
at
war
with
a
civilization
on
his
side
is
proverbial
philosophy
a
galaxy
of
invisible
saints
and
sages
and
the
consciousness
and
professions
of
everybody
against
him
is
the
world
and
every
selfish
passion
in
his
own
heart
the
instant
he
declares
war
every
inducement
is
offered
to
make
him
stop
envy
want
the
patron
and
the
intervene
the
instant
he
stops
fighting
he
is
allied
with
the
enemy
he
is
bought
up
by
prejudice
or
by
fatigue
he
begins
to
realize
the
importance
of
particular
visible
institutions
as
if
their
sole
value
did
not
come
from
the
fraction
of
unselfishness
they
represent
he
rushes
headlong
into
trade
and
thenceforth
can
see
his
country
only
as
a
series
of
trade
interests
he
gets
into
some
church
and
begins
to
value
its
organization
or
into
some
party
and
begins
to
value
its
past
or
into
some
club
and
begins
to
value
his
feelings
the
consequence
is
that
you
may
search
christendom
and
hardly
find
a
man
who
is
free
the
advance
of
the
world
like
the
improvement
of
our
local
politics
has
always
been
the
work
of
young
men
it
is
done
by
men
before
their
minds
have
been
worn
into
ruts
by
particular
businesses
or
their
sight
shortened
by
the
study
of
near
things
what
we
love
in
the
young
is
not
their
youth
but
their
force
the
energy
that
runs
through
them
makes
them
sensitive
they
feel
the
importance
of
remote
things
and
infer
the
relations
of
the
present
to
the
future
more
truly
than
their
elders
they
are
touched
by
hints
the
direct
language
of
humanity
is
plain
and
native
to
them
the
invisible
waves
of
force
which
do
as
a
matter
of
fact
rule
the
world
using
its
fictions
and
its
phrases
as
mere
strike
keenly
upon
the
heart
of
the
youth
and
the
vibrations
of
instinctive
passion
that
shake
his
frame
are
the
response
of
a
strong
creature
to
the
laws
of
its
universe
this
unlearned
knowledge
of
good
and
evil
is
like
the
response
of
the
eyes
to
light
or
of
the
tongue
to
the
taste
of
a
fruit
it
was
not
indoctrinated
it
is
a
reaction
to
a
stimulus
so
long
as
the
world
shall
last
men
will
be
writing
books
in
order
to
explain
and
justify
the
instincts
inventing
theologies
and
ethical
codes
and
projecting
political
programs
to
advance
and
confirm
them
if
you
take
up
some
particular
matter
and
begin
to
trace
out
its
consequences
upon
mankind
you
find
yourself
forced
boldly
to
embrace
the
sum
of
all
human
destiny
we
can
not
follow
out
this
course
in
detail
we
see
only
tendency
we
see
only
influence
enlarge
our
horizon
as
we
will
we
can
not
live
out
the
lives
of
all
future
generations
and
thus
furnish
an
answer
to
the
first
caviller
who
interrupts
our
argument
with
a
the
generous
impulses
of
youth
represent
a
vision
of
consequences
they
take
in
more
of
the
future
at
one
glance
than
a
philosopher
can
state
in
a
year
certainly
so
far
as
we
can
follow
out
the
threads
of
influence
the
lines
seem
to
converge
they
make
a
figure
and
point
to
a
conclusion
exactly
upon
that
spot
in
the
firmament
where
instinct
would
place
it
if
philosophy
gives
us
a
diagram
the
rest
of
life
fills
it
up
and
embellishes
it
with
infinite
illustration
the
proofs
multiply
and
are
hurled
in
upon
us
from
all
quarters
of
life
and
all
provinces
of
endeavor
the
anecdotes
and
fables
of
the
world
its
drama
its
poetry
and
fiction
its
religion
and
piety
its
domestic
teaching
and
its
monuments
support
this
instinct
and
describe
the
same
figure
further
still
there
is
not
a
man
who
does
not
reveal
it
in
his
anatomy
so
much
so
that
upon
every
occasion
except
where
his
interests
are
touched
he
is
for
virtue
and
even
where
they
are
touched
it
is
only
a
question
of
a
few
degrees
more
heat
to
dissolve
the
habits
and
prejudices
of
a
lifetime
and
make
him
take
off
his
coat
and
go
into
a
war
or
a
political
campaign
a
single
man
as
we
see
him
in
one
of
the
great
modern
civilizations
looks
like
a
bit
of
machinery
a
cog
or
a
crank
or
an
the
business
man
is
especially
mechanical
his
functions
are
so
accurate
so
delimited
and
specialized
and
yet
any
theory
that
dwells
upon
these
limitations
is
put
to
shame
in
five
minutes
for
the
creature
eats
and
sheds
tears
before
your
eyes
all
of
the
reasons
for
not
doing
some
particular
act
that
you
think
wise
to
be
done
turn
out
to
be
founded
on
the
idea
that
this
man
is
a
and
nothing
but
a
you
can
not
change
him
they
say
you
must
take
him
as
he
is
i
have
never
heard
any
argument
given
against
the
wisdom
of
righteousness
except
the
existence
of
evil
exists
therefore
subserve
is
it
not
clear
that
evil
exists
only
because
people
subserve
it
it
has
no
fixity
withdraw
your
support
and
it
begins
to
perish
one
man
says
let
the
world
go
all
the
wickedness
and
unhappiness
in
it
are
another
says
little
concession
to
present
conditions
must
be
nothing
can
be
said
to
justify
the
second
man
that
is
not
moral
support
to
the
first
your
concession
is
always
the
acknowledgment
of
weakness
now
you
may
make
allowances
for
a
man
who
has
not
come
up
to
the
mark
but
if
you
make
allowances
for
him
beforehand
and
assume
that
he
is
not
going
to
do
right
you
corrupt
him
if
these
things
are
true
then
we
are
absolved
from
all
complicity
with
vice
we
need
never
take
a
course
that
requires
to
be
explained
we
thus
get
rid
of
a
great
oppression
and
can
breathe
freely
in
the
language
of
the
old
piety
pack
falls
from
his
back
that
pack
has
in
all
ages
been
a
perversion
of
the
conscience
a
mistake
as
to
the
size
of
the
universe
we
have
seen
all
these
ranks
and
armies
of
humanity
pass
in
review
before
us
each
man
with
his
eyes
fixed
in
mesmeric
intensity
upon
some
set
of
opinions
until
he
grew
to
be
the
thing
he
looked
on
these
opinions
of
his
are
all
we
know
of
him
they
are
not
our
own
opinions
they
often
appear
to
us
misguided
and
illusory
yet
there
is
always
to
be
found
in
them
the
light
of
some
benevolence
they
are
like
broken
mirrors
and
give
back
fractions
of
a
larger
idea
the
hope
and
courage
in
each
of
these
men
bless
and
advance
the
world
but
not
in
the
way
that
the
men
themselves
expect
they
seem
all
to
be
bent
over
a
game
of
chess
where
every
move
has
its
real
significance
upon
another
board
which
they
do
not
see
each
man
seems
to
be
following
some
across
a
landscape
at
night
no
cannon
can
waken
these
insensate
sleepers
and
yet
they
are
tracing
out
patterns
and
geometrical
diagrams
upon
the
sward
they
are
weaving
a
magical
dance
that
for
all
its
intricacy
has
a
planetary
rhythm
and
the
sober
motion
of
a
pendulum
each
individual
in
this
unthinkable
host
gives
an
instance
of
the
same
fatality
first
that
he
becomes
the
thing
he
looks
on
and
second
that
he
accomplishes
something
that
he
does
not
understand
and
both
parts
of
this
fatality
must
hold
true
of
ourselves
certainly
our
subjection
to
the
thing
we
look
on
is
almost
pitiable
we
can
not
even
remember
a
righteous
hatred
without
beginning
to
take
color
from
the
thing
we
hate
our
goodness
comes
solely
from
thinking
on
goodness
our
wickedness
from
thinking
on
wickedness
we
too
are
the
victims
of
our
own
contemplation
as
for
the
last
half
of
that
fatality
that
keeps
us
forever
ignorant
of
the
true
meaning
of
our
lives
it
is
not
an
absolute
ignorance
like
our
ignorance
of
how
we
came
to
exist
it
is
a
qualified
ignorance
like
our
ignorance
that
we
have
hurt
some
feelings
the
elements
of
understanding
are
within
us
the
whole
matter
may
become
clear
the
borders
of
our
understanding
extend
as
we
push
outward
our
frontier
of
inquiry
this
is
both
a
frontier
of
scepticism
and
of
faith
it
is
a
bulwark
of
doubt
as
to
the
value
of
our
last
new
formula
and
of
faith
as
to
the
reality
behind
that
formula
as
we
go
forward
bringing
our
lives
down
to
date
holding
our
experience
at
length
and
examining
it
with
a
merciless
endeavor
to
wring
the
truth
out
of
it
we
do
from
day
to
day
get
a
clearer
notion
of
the
actual
world
a
truer
idea
of
our
own
place
in
it
this
qualified
and
modest
understanding
of
life
that
comes
from
putting
things
together
that
seem
to
go
together
is
within
the
power
of
any
one
and
we
find
this
the
more
unselfish
men
become
the
more
sensitive
do
they
become
in
understanding
human
relations
the
gambler
can
not
see
that
he
is
giving
pain
to
his
family
his
has
blunted
his
sensibilities
the
faith
healer
knows
that
he
is
curing
a
man
in
a
neighboring
state
his
love
for
mankind
has
refined
his
sensibilities
most
of
us
stand
somewhere
between
these
two
extremes
in
the
scale
of
understanding
and
are
moving
towards
one
or
the
other
education
then
is
the
process
by
which
we
gradually
discover
both
the
real
nature
of
the
human
life
about
us
and
our
own
relation
to
the
whole
of
it
the
process
is
never
complete
even
poets
and
great
men
are
in
the
dark
about
their
own
function
but
they
are
less
in
the
dark
than
the
rest
of
us
they
speak
from
a
knowledge
that
is
greater
than
ours
they
have
a
wonderful
power
over
us
for
they
help
us
in
our
struggle
to
see
the
world

few

their

no
one
can
read
book
without
finding
in

something
instructive
and
suggestive
the
author
is
an
enthusiast
for
humanity
converted
by
stress
of
circumstances
into
a
preacher
against
corruption
his
book
is
a
manly
appeal
to
the
rising
generation
for
whom
it
has
a
message
of
courage
and
hope
sadly

this
is
a
brilliant
little
book
chapman
wields
a
razor
edge
of
forcible
statement
and
he
is
inspired
by
a
moral
passion
that
makes
his
utterance
a
breathing
vital
the
author
is
essentially
a
critic
clear
and
incisive
at
times
rather
sweeping
in
his
generalities
yet
always
fresh
and
stimulating
his
attack
on
the
corruption
of
american
politics
is
as
vigorous
