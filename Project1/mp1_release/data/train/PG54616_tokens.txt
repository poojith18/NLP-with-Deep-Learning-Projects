preface
this
book
is
what
its
author
believes
to
be
the
only
attempt
yet
made
to
put
the
english
reader
into
possession
in
clear
compact
and
what
it
is
hoped
may
prove
agreeable
form
of
the
mythical
legendary
and
poetic
traditions
of
the
earliest
inhabitants
of
our
islands
who
have
left
us
written
gaelic
and
the
british
celts
it
is
true
that
admirable
translations
and
paraphrases
of
much
of
gaelic
mythical
saga
have
been
recently
published
and
that
lady
charlotte
translation
of
the
has
been
placed
within
the
reach
of
the
least
wealthy
reader
but
these
books
not
merely
each
cover
a
portion
only
of
the
whole
ground
but
in
addition
contain
little
elucidatory
matter
their
characters
stand
isolated
and
unexplained
and
the
details
that
would
explain
them
must
be
sought
for
with
considerable
trouble
in
the
lectures
and
essays
of
scholars
to
learned
societies
the
reader
to
whom
this
literature
is
entirely
new
is
introduced
as
it
were
to
numerous
people
of
whose
antecedents
he
knows
nothing
and
the
effect
is
often
disconcerting
enough
to
make
him
lay
down
the
volume
in
despair
but
here
he
will
at
last
make
the
formal
acquaintance
of
all
the
chief
characters
of
celtic
myth
of
the
gaelic
gods
and
the
giants
against
whom
they
struggled
of
the
of
the
red
of
ulster
heroes
of
a
martial
epopee
almost
worthy
to
be
placed
beside
tale
of
troy
and
of
finn
and
his
fenians
he
will
meet
also
with
the
divine
and
heroic
personages
of
the
ancient
britons
with
their
earliest
gods
kin
to
the
members
of
the
gaelic
pantheon
as
well
as
with
arthur
and
his
knights
whom
he
will
recognize
as
no
mortal
champions
but
belonging
to
the
same
mythic
company
of
all
these
mighty
figures
the
histories
will
be
briefly
recorded
from
the
time
of
their
unquestioned
godhood
through
their
various
transformations
to
the
last
doubtful
dying
recognition
of
them
in
the
present
day
as
thus
the
volume
will
form
a
kind
of
handbook
to
a
subject
of
growing
which
is
after
all
no
indeed
no
an
endeavour
to
refresh
the
vitality
of
english
poetry
at
its
most
ancient
native
fount
the
book
does
not
of
course
profess
to
be
for
celtic
scholars
to
whom
indeed
its
author
himself
owes
all
that
is
within
it
it
aims
only
at
interesting
the
reader
familiar
with
the
mythologies
of
greece
rome
and
scandinavia
in
another
and
a
nearer
source
of
poetry
its
wish
is
to
offer
those
who
have
fallen
or
will
fall
under
the
attraction
of
celtic
legend
and
romance
just
such
a
volume
as
he
himself
would
once
have
welcomed
and
for
which
he
sought
in
vain
it
is
his
hope
that
in
choosing
from
the
considerable
though
scattered
translations
and
commentaries
of
students
of
old
gaelic
and
old
welsh
he
has
chosen
wisely
and
that
his
readers
will
be
able
should
they
wish
to
use
his
book
as
a
to
the
authorities
themselves
to
that
end
it
is
wholly
directed
and
its
marginal
notes
and
short
bibliographical
appendix
follow
the
same
plan
they
do
not
aspire
to
anything
like
completeness
but
only
to
point
out
the
chief
sources
from
which
he
himself
has
drawn
to
acknowledge
as
far
as
possible
such
debts
is
now
the
pleasing
duty
first
and
foremost
he
has
relied
upon
the
volumes
of
de
de
littérature
and
the
hibbert
lectures
for
of
john
rhys
professor
of
celtic
in
the
university
of
oxford
with
their
sequel
entitled
in
the
arthurian
from
the
writings
of
alfred
nutt
he
has
also
obtained
much
help
with
regard
to
direct
translations
it
seems
almost
superfluous
to
refer
to
lady
charlotte
and
ancient
books
of
or
to
the
work
of
such
gaelic
scholars
as
eugene
kuno
meyer
whitley
stokes
ernest
windisch
standish
hayes
to
mention
no
others
as
contained
in
such
publications
as
the
the
and
the
of
the
ossianic
in
of
of
and
miss
but
space
is
lacking
to
do
justice
to
all
the
reader
is
referred
to
the
marginal
notes
and
the
appendix
for
the
works
of
these
and
other
authors
who
will
no
doubt
pardon
the
use
made
of
their
researches
to
one
whose
sole
object
has
been
to
gain
a
larger
audience
for
the
studies
they
have
most
at
heart
finally
perhaps
a
word
should
be
said
upon
that
vexed
question
the
transliteration
of
gaelic
as
yet
there
is
no
universal
or
consistent
method
of
spelling
the
author
has
therefore
chosen
the
forms
which
seemed
most
familiar
to
himself
hoping
in
that
way
to
best
serve
the
uses
of

chapter
i
the
interest
and
importance
of
celtic
mythology
it
should
hardly
be
necessary
to
remind
the
reader
of
what
profound
interest
and
value
to
every
nation
are
its
earliest
legendary
and
poetical
records
the
beautiful
myths
of
greece
form
a
sufficing
example
in
threefold
manner
they
have
influenced
the
destiny
of
the
people
that
created
them
and
of
the
country
of
which
they
were
the
imagined
theatre
first
in
the
ages
in
which
they
were
still
fresh
belief
and
pride
in
them
were
powerful
enough
to
bring
scattered
tribes
into
confederation
secondly
they
gave
the
inspiration
to
sculptor
and
poet
of
an
art
and
literature
unsurpassed
if
not
unequalled
by
any
other
age
or
race
lastly
when
glory
that
was
had
faded
and
her
people
had
by
dint
of
successive
invasions
perhaps
even
ceased
to
have
any
right
to
call
themselves
hellenes
they
have
passed
over
into
the
literatures
of
the
modern
world
and
so
given
to
greece
herself
a
poetic
interest
that
still
makes
a
petty
kingdom
of
greater
account
in
the
eyes
of
its
compeers
than
many
others
far
superior
to
it
in
extent
and
resources
this
permeating
influence
of
the
greek
poetical
mythology
apparent
in
all
civilized
countries
has
acted
especially
upon
our
own
from
almost
the
very
dawn
of
english
literature
the
greek
stories
of
gods
and
heroes
have
formed
a
large
part
of
the
of
english
poets
the
inhabitants
of
olympus
occupy
under
their
latin
names
almost
as
great
a
space
in
english
poetry
as
they
did
in
that
of
the
countries
to
which
they
were
native
from
chaucer
downwards
they
have
captivated
the
imagination
alike
of
the
poets
and
their
hearers
the
magic
cauldron
of
classic
myth
fed
like
the
celtic
all
who
came
to
it
for
sustenance
at
last
however
its
potency
became
somewhat
exhausted
alien
and
exotic
to
english
soil
it
degenerated
slowly
into
a
convention
in
the
shallow
hands
of
the
poetasters
of
the
eighteenth
century
its
figures
became
mere
puppets
with
every
wood
a
and
every
rustic
maid
a
one
could
only
expect
to
find
venus
armed
with
patch
and
mars
shouldering
a
musket
and
apollo
inspiring
the
own
trivial
strains
the
affectation
fortunately
mode
of
expression
which
had
become
obsolete
smothered
by
just
ridicule
and
abandoned
to
the
commonplace
vocabulary
of
the
inferior
classic
myth
became
a
subject
which
only
the
greatest
poets
could
afford
to
handle
but
mythology
is
of
such
vital
need
to
literature
that
deprived
of
the
store
of
legend
native
to
southern
europe
imaginative
writers
looked
for
a
fresh
impulse
they
turned
their
eyes
to
the
north
inspiration
was
sought
not
from
olympus
but
from
asgard
moreover
it
was
believed
that
the
fount
of
primeval
poetry
issuing
from
scandinavian
and
teutonic
myth
was
truly
our
own
and
that
we
were
rightful
heirs
of
it
by
reason
of
the
in
our
blood
and
so
indeed
we
are
but
it
is
not
our
sole
heritage
there
must
also
run
much
is
truly
in
our
veins
and
matthew
arnold
was
probably
right
in
asserting
that
while
we
owe
to
the
the
more
practical
qualities
that
have
built
up
the
british
empire
we
have
inherited
from
the
celtic
side
that
poetic
vision
which
has
made
english
literature
the
most
brilliant
since
the
greek
we
have
the
right
therefore
to
enter
upon
a
new
spiritual
possession
and
a
splendid
one
it
is
the
celtic
mythology
has
little
of
the
heavy
crudeness
that
repels
one
in
teutonic
and
scandinavian
story
it
is
as
beautiful
and
graceful
as
the
greek
and
unlike
the
greek
which
is
the
reflection
of
a
clime
and
soil
which
few
of
us
will
ever
see
it
is
our
own
divinities
should
surely
seem
the
inevitable
outgrowth
of
the
land
they
move
in
how
strange
apollo
would
appear
naked
among
icebergs
or
thor
striding
under
groves
of
palms
but
the
celtic
gods
and
heroes
are
the
natural
inhabitants
of
a
british
landscape
not
seeming
foreign
and
in
a
scene
where
there
is
no
vine
or
olive
but
in
our
homely
oak
and
bracken
gorse
and
heath
thus
we
gain
an
altogether
fresh
interest
in
the
beautiful
spots
of
our
own
islands
especially
those
of
the
wilder
and
more
mountainous
west
where
the
older
inhabitants
of
the
land
lingered
longest
saxon
conquest
obliterated
much
in
eastern
britain
and
changed
more
but
in
the
west
of
england
in
wales
in
scotland
and
especially
in
ireland
the
hills
and
dales
still
keep
memories
of
the
ancient
gods
of
the
ancient
race
here
and
there
in
south
wales
and
the
west
of
england
are
mysterious
and
still
the
british
celts
held
to
be
the
homes
of
gods
or
outposts
of
the
other
world
in
ireland
not
only
is
there
scarcely
a
place
that
is
not
connected
in
some
way
with
the
traditionary
exploits
of
the
branch
or
of
finn
and
his
mighty
men
but
the
old
deities
are
still
remembered
dwarfed
into
fairies
but
keeping
the
same
attributes
and
the
same
names
as
of
yore
complaint
that
while
pelion
and
ossa
olympus
and
parnassus
are
immortal
books
not
one
english
mountain
round
our
shore
they
rise
in
had
been
the
celestial
muses
doubtless
seemed
true
to
his
own
generation
thanks
to
the
scholars
who
have
unveiled
the
ancient
gaelic
and
british
mythologies
it
need
not
be
so
for
ours
on
ludgate
hill
as
well
as
on
many
less
famous
eminences
once
stood
the
temple
of
the
british
zeus
a
mountain
not
far
from
was
the
british
olympus
the
court
and
palace
of
our
ancient
gods
it
may
well
be
doubted
however
whether
contemporaries
would
have
welcomed
the
mythology
which
was
their
own
by
right
of
birth
as
a
substitute
for
that
of
greece
and
rome
the
inspiration
of
classic
culture
which
wordsworth
was
one
of
the
first
to
break
with
was
still
powerful
how
some
of
its
professors
would
have
held
their
sides
and
roared
at
the
very
notion
of
a
british
mythology
yet
all
the
time
it
had
long
been
secretly
leavening
english
ideas
and
ideals
none
the
less
potently
because
disguised
under
forms
which
could
be
readily
appreciated
popular
fancy
had
rehabilitated
the
old
gods
long
banned
by
the
bell
book
and
candle
under
various
disguises
they
still
lived
on
in
legend
as
kings
of
ancient
britain
reigning
in
a
fabulous
past
anterior
to
julius
were
king
lud
founder
of
london
king
lear

legend
was
immortalized
by
shakespeare

brennius
who
conquered

as
well
as
many
others
who
will
be
found
filling
parts
in
old
drama
they
still
lived
on
as
saints
of
the
early
churches
of
ireland
and
britain
whose
wonderful
attributes
and
adventures
are
in
many
cases
only
those
of
their
original
namesakes
the
old
gods
told
afresh
and
they
still
lived
on
in
another
and
a
yet
more
potent
way

arthur
and
his
cycle
of
gods

into
the
hands
of
the
norman
to
reappear
as
romances
of
king
arthur
and
his
knights

the
table
round
thus
spread
over
civilized
europe
their
influence
was
immense
their

literature
we

swinburne

but
meanwhile
the
reader
will
probably
be
asking
what
evidence
there
is
that
apocryphal
british
kings
like
lear
and
lud
and
questionable
irish
saints
like
bridget
are
really
disguised
celtic
divinities
or
that
the
morte
with
its
love
of
launcelot
and
the
queen
and
its
quest
of
the
holy
grail
was
ever
anything
more
than
an
invention
of
the
norman
he
will
demand
to
know
what
facts
we
really
possess
about
this
supposed
celtic
mythology
alleged
to
have
furnished
their
prototypes
and
of
what
real
antiquity
and
value
are
our
authorities
upon
it
the
answer
to
his
question
will
be
found

the
sources
of
our
knowledge
of
the
celtic
mythology
we
may
begin
by
asserting
with
confidence
that
elton
has
touched
upon
a
part
only
of
the
material
on
which
we
may
draw
to
reconstruct
the
ancient
british
mythology
luckily
we
are
not
wholly
dependent
upon
the
difficult
tasks
of
resolving
the
fabled
deeds
of
apocryphal
irish
and
british
kings
who
reigned
earlier
than
patrick
or
before
julius
caesar
into
their
original
form
of
celtic
myths
of
sifting
the
attributes
and
miracles
of
doubtfully
historical
saints
or
of
separating
the
primitive
pagan
elements
in
the
legends
of
arthur
and
his
knights
from
the
embellishments
added
by
the
we
have
in
addition
to
we
may
for
the
present
put
upon
one
side
as
a
mass
of
genuine
early
writings
which
though
in
the
form
in
which
they
now
exist
none
the
less
descend
from
the
preceding
pagan
age
these
are
contained
in
vellum
and
parchment
manuscripts
long
preserved
from
destruction
in
mansions
and
monasteries
in
ireland
scotland
and
wales
and
only
during
the
last
century
brought
to
light
copied
and
translated
by
the
patient
labours
of
scholars
who
have
grappled
with
the
dialects
in
which
they
were
transcribed
many
of
these
volumes
are
curious
miscellanies
usually
the
one
book
of
a
great
house
or
monastic
community
everything
was
copied
into
it
that
the
scholar
of
the
family
or
brotherhood
thought
to
be
best
worth
preserving
hence
they
contain
matter
of
the
most
diverse
kind
there
are
translations
of
portions
of
the
bible
and
of
the
classics
and
of
such
then
popular
books
as
geoffrey
of
and
histories
of
britain
lives
of
famous
saints
together
with
works
attributed
to
them
poems
and
romances
of
which
under
a
thin
disguise
the
old
gaelic
and
british
gods
are
the
heroes
together
with
treatises
on
all
the
subjects
then
prosody
law
history
geography
chronology
and
the
genealogies
of
important
chiefs
the
majority
of
these
documents
were
put
together
during
a
period
which
roughly
speaking
lasted
from
the
beginning
of
the
twelfth
century
to
the
end
of
the
sixteenth
in
ireland
in
wales
and
apparently
also
in
scotland
it
was
a
time
of
literary
revival
after
the
turmoils
of
the
previous
epoch
in
ireland
the
norsemen
after
long
ravaging
had
settled
peacefully
down
while
in
wales
the
norman
conquest
had
rendered
the
country
for
the
first
time
comparatively
quiet
the
scattered
remains
of
history
lay
and
ecclesiastical
of
science
and
of
legend
were
gathered
together
of
the
irish
manuscripts
the
earliest
and
for
our
purposes
the
most
important
on
account
of
the
great
store
of
ancient
gaelic
mythology
which
in
spite
of
its
dilapidated
condition
it
still
contains
is
in
the
possession
of
the
royal
irish
academy
unluckily
it
is
reduced
to
a
fragment
of
one
hundred
and
pages
but
this
remnant
preserves
a
large
number
of
romances
relating
to
the
old
gods
and
heroes
of
ireland
among
other
things
it
contains
a
complete
account
of
the
epical
saga
called
the
bó
the
of
the
cattle
of
in
which
the
hero
cuchulainn
performed
his
greatest
feats
this
manuscript
is
called
the
book
of
the
dun
cow
from
the
tradition
that
it
was
copied
from
an
earlier
book
written
upon
the
skin
of
a
favourite
animal
belonging
to
saint
ciaran
who
lived
in
the
seventh
century
an
entry
upon
one
of
its
pages
reveals
the
name
of
its
scribe
one
maelmuiri
whom
we
know
to
have
been
killed
by
robbers
in
the
church
of
clonmacnois
in
the
year
far
more
voluminous
and
but
little
less
ancient
is
the
book
of
leinster
said
to
have
been
compiled
in
the
early
part
of
the
twelfth
century
by
finn
mac
gorman
bishop
of
kildare
this
also
contains
an
account
of
mighty
deeds
which
supplements
the
older
version
in
the
book
of
the
dun
cow
of
somewhat
less
importance
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
student
of
gaelic
mythology
come
the
book
of
ballymote
and
the
yellow
book
of
lecan
belonging
to
the
end
of
the
fourteenth
century
and
the
books
of
lecan
and
of
lismore
both
attributed
to
the
fifteenth
besides
these
six
great
collections
there
survive
many
other
manuscripts
which
also
contain
ancient
mythical
lore
in
one
of
these
dating
from
the
fifteenth
century
is
to
be
found
the
story
of
the
battle
of
moytura
fought
between
the
gods
of
ireland
and
their
enemies
the
fomors
or
demons
of
the
deep
sea
the
scottish
manuscripts
preserved
in
the
library
at
edinburgh
date
back
in
some
cases
as
far
as
the
fourteenth
century
though
the
majority
of
them
belong
to
the
fifteenth
and
sixteenth
they
corroborate
the
irish
documents
add
to
the
cuchulainn
saga
and
make
a
more
special
subject
of
the
other
heroic
cycle
that
which
relates
the
not
less
wonderful
deeds
of
finn
ossian
and
the
fenians
they
also
contain
stories
of
other
characters
who
more
ancient
than
either
finn
or
cuchulainn
are
the
tuatha
dé
danann
the
of
the
ancient
gaels
the
welsh
documents
cover
about
the
same
period
as
the
irish
and
the
scottish
four
of
these
stand
out
from
the
rest
as
most
important
the
oldest
is
the
black
book
of
caermarthen
which
dates
from
the
third
quarter
of
the
twelfth
century
the
book
of
aneurin
which
was
written
late
in
the
thirteenth
the
book
of
taliesin
assigned
to
the
fourteenth
and
the
red
book
of
hergest
compiled
by
various
persons
during
that
century
and
the
one
following
it
the
first
three
of
these
ancient
books
of
are
small
in
size
and
contain
poems
attributed
to
the
great
traditional
bards
of
the
sixth
century
myrddin
taliesin
and
aneurin
the
red
book
of
far
larger
in
it
are
to
be
found
welsh
translations
of
the
british
chronicles
the
triads
verses
celebrating
famous
traditionary
persons
or
things
ancient
poems
attributed
to
llywarch
hên
and
of
priceless
value
to
any
study
of
our
subject
the
mabinogion
stories
in
which
large
portions
of
the
old
british
mythology
are
worked
up
into
romantic
form
the
whole
bulk
therefore
of
the
native
literature
bearing
upon
the
mythology
of
the
british
islands
may
be
attributed
to
a
period
which
lasted
from
the
beginning
of
the
twelfth
century
to
the
end
of
the
sixteenth
but
even
the
commencement
of
this
era
will
no
doubt
seem
far
too
late
a
day
to
allow
authenticity
to
matter
which
ought
to
have
vastly
preceded
it
the
date
however
merely
marks
the
final
redaction
of
the
contents
of
the
manuscripts
into
the
form
in
which
they
now
exist
without
bearing
at
all
upon
the
time
of
their
authorship
avowedly
copies
of
ancient
poems
and
tales
from
much
older
manuscripts
the
present
books
no
more
fix
the
period
of
the
original
composition
of
their
contents
than
the
presence
of
a
portion
of
the
in
a
modern
anthology
of
english
poetry
would
assign
chaucer
to
the
present
year
of
grace
this
may
be
proved
both
directly
and
inferentially
in
some
in
that
of
an
elegy
upon
saint
columba
in
the
book
of
the
dun
dates
of
authorship
are
actually
given
in
others
we
may
depend
upon
evidence
which
if
not
quite
so
absolute
is
nearly
as
convincing
even
where
the
writer
does
not
state
that
he
is
copying
from
older
manuscripts
it
is
obvious
that
this
must
have
been
the
case
from
the
glosses
in
his
version
the
scribes
of
the
earlier
gaelic
manuscripts
very
often
found
in
the
documents
from
which
they
themselves
were
copying
words
so
archaic
as
to
be
unintelligible
to
the
readers
of
their
own
period
to
render
them
comprehensible
they
were
obliged
to
insert
marginal
notes
which
explained
these
obsolete
words
by
reference
to
other
manuscripts
more
ancient
still
often
the
mediæval
copyists
have
ignorantly
moved
these
notes
from
the
margin
into
the
text
where
they
remain
like
philological
fossils
to
give
evidence
of
previous
forms
of
life
the
documents
from
which
they
were
taken
have
perished
leaving
the
mediæval
copies
as
their
sole
record
in
the
welsh
mabinogion
the
same
process
is
apparent
peculiarities
in
the
existing
manuscripts
show
plainly
enough
that
they
must
have
been
copied
from
some
more
archaic
text
besides
this
they
are
as
they
at
present
stand
obviously
made
up
of
earlier
tales
pieced
together
almost
as
clearly
as
the
gaelic
manuscripts
the
welsh
point
us
back
to
older
and
more
primitive
forms
the
ancient
legends
of
the
gael
and
the
briton
are
thus
shown
to
have
been
no
mere
inventions
of
scholarly
monks
in
the
middle
ages
we
have
now
to
trace
if
possible
the
date
not
necessarily
of
their
first
appearance
on
lips
but
of
their
first
redaction
into
writing
in
approximately
the
form
in
which
we
have
them
now
circumstantial
evidence
can
be
adduced
to
prove
that
the
most
important
portions
both
of
gaelic
and
british
early
literature
can
be
safely
relegated
to
a
period
of
several
centuries
prior
to
their
record
our
earliest
version
of
the
episode
of
the
bó
which
is
the
nucleus
and
centre
of
the
ancient
gaelic
heroic
cycle
of
which
cuchulainn
heros
is
the
principal
figure
is
found
in
the
book
of
the
dun
cow
but
legend
tells
us
that
at
the
beginning
of
the
seventh
century
the
saga
had
not
only
been
composed
but
had
actually
become
so
obsolete
as
to
have
been
forgotten
by
the
bards
their
leader
one
senchan
torpeist
a
historical
character
and
chief
bard
of
ireland
at
that
time
obtained
permission
from
the
saints
to
call
fergus
contemporary
and
a
chief
actor
in
the
from
the
dead
and
received
from
the
resurrected
hero
a
true
and
full
version
this
tradition
dealing
with
a
real
personage
surely
shows
that
the
story
of
the
was
known
before
the
time
of
senchan
and
probably
preserves
the
fact
either
that
his
version
of
famous
deeds
became
the
accepted
one
or
that
he
was
the
first
to
reduce
it
to
writing
an
equally
suggestive
consideration
approximately
fixes
for
us
the
earliest
redaction
of
the
welsh
mythological
prose
tales
called
the
or
more
correctly
speaking
the
branches
of
the
in
none
of
these
is
there
the
slightest
mention
or
apparently
the
least
knowledge
of
arthur
around
whom
and
whose
supposed
contemporaries
centres
the
mass
of
british
legend
as
it
was
transmitted
by
the
welsh
to
the
normans
these
mysterious
mythological
records
must
in
all
probability
therefore
antedate
the
arthurian
cycle
of
myth
which
was
already
being
put
into
form
in
the
sixth
century
on
the
other
hand
the
characters
of
the
are
mentioned
without
though
they
were
personages
with
whom
no
one
could
fail
to
be
the
supposed
poems
contained
in
those
ancient
books
of
in
which
are
found
the
first
meagre
references
to
the
british
hero
such
considerations
as
these
throw
back
with
reasonable
certainty
the
existence
of
the
irish
and
welsh
poems
and
prose
tales
in
something
like
their
present
shape
to
a
period
antedating
the
seventh
century
but
this
again
means
only
that
the
myths
traditions
and
legends
were
current
at
that
to
us
early
but
to
them
in
their
actual
substance
late
date
in
literary
form
a
mythology
must
always
be
far
older
than
the
oldest
verses
and
stories
that
celebrate
it
elaborate
poems
and
sagas
are
not
made
in
a
day
or
in
a
year
the
legends
of
the
gaelic
and
british
gods
and
heroes
could
not
have
sprung
like
athena
from
the
head
of
zeus
out
of
some
brain
the
bard
who
first
put
them
into
artistic
shape
was
setting
down
the
primitive
traditions
of
his
race
we
may
therefore
venture
to
describe
them
as
not
of
the
twelfth
century
or
of
the
seventh
but
as
of
a
prehistoric
and
immemorial
antiquity
internal
evidence
bears
this
out
an
examination
of
both
the
gaelic
and
british
legendary
romances
shows
under
embellishing
details
added
by
later
hands
an
inner
core
of
primeval
thought
which
brings
them
into
line
with
the
similar
ideas
of
other
races
in
the
earliest
stage
of
culture
their
may
be
that
of
their
last
but
their
are
the
characters
of
early
gaelic
legend
belong
to
the
same
stamp
of
imagination
that
created
olympian
and
titan
æsir
and
jötun
we
must
go
far
to
the
back
of
civilized
thought
to
find
parallels
to
such
a
story
as
that
in
which
the
british
struck
by
a
rival
in
love
with
a
poisoned
spear
is
turned
into
an
eagle
from
whose
wound
great
pieces
of
carrion
are
continually
failing
this
aspect
of
the
celtic
literary
records
was
clearly
seen
and
eloquently
expressed
by
matthew
arnold
in
his
of
celtic
he
was
referring
to
the
welsh
side
but
his
image
holds
good
equally
for
the
gaelic
first
thing
that
strikes
he
says
reading
the
is
how
evidently
the
mediæval
is
pillaging
an
antiquity
of
which
he
does
not
fully
possess
the
secret
he
is
like
a
peasant
building
his
hut
on
the
site
of
halicarnassus
or
ephesus
he
builds
but
what
he
builds
is
full
of
materials
of
which
he
knows
not
the
history
or
knows
by
a
glimmering
tradition
merely
stones
of
this
but
of
an
older

greater
cunninger

no
mediæval

they
belong

an
older
pagan

three
great
gaelic
cycles

as
they
are
they
had
taken
on
the
semblance
of
mortality
by
the
time
their
histories
were
fixed
in
the
form
in
which
we
have
them
now
their
earliest
records
if
those
could
be
restored

us

will
but
not

away

the
copyists
whether
irish
or

countenance
this
hence
we
have
the
singular
paradox
of
the
deaths
of
immortals
there
is
hardly
one
of
the
figures
of
either
the
gaelic
or
the
british
pantheon
whose
demise
is

somewhere
recorded
usually
they
fell
in
the
unceasing
battles
between
the
divinities
of
darkness
and
of
light
their
deaths
in
earlier
cycles
of
myth
however
do
not
preclude
their
appearance
in
later
ones
only
indeed
with
the
closing
of
the
lips
of
the
last
mortal
who
preserved

previous
to
the
roman
invasion
are
generally
described
as
but
they
must
have
been
largely
a
mixed
race
and
the
people
with
whom
they
mingled
must
have
modified
to
perhaps
to
a
their
physique
their
customs
and
their
language
speculation
has
run
somewhat
wild
over
the
question
of
the
composition
of
the
early
britons
but
out
of
the
clash
of
rival
theories
there
emerges
one
may
be
considered
as
scientifically
established
we
have
certain
proof
of
two
distinct
human
stocks
in
the
british
islands
at
the
time
of
the
roman
conquest
and
so
great
an
authority
as
professor
huxley
has
given
his
opinion
that
there
is
no
evidence
of
any
others
the
earliest
of
these
two
races
would
seem
to
have
inhabited
our
islands
from
the
most
ancient
times
and
may
for
our
purpose
be
described
as
aboriginal
it
was
the
people
that
built
the
and
which
is
variously
called
by
ethnologists
the
iberian
mediterranean
berber
basque
silurian
or
euskarian
race
in
physique
it
was
short
swarthy
and
its
language
belonged
to
the
class
called
the
surviving
types
of
which
are
found
among
the
gallas
abyssinians
berbers
and
other
north
african
tribes
and
it
seems
to
have
come
originally
from
some
part
either
of
eastern
northern
or
central
africa
spreading
thence
it
was
probably
the
first
people
to
inhabit
the
valley
of
the
nile
and
it
sent
offshoots
into
syria
and
asia
minor
the
earliest
hellenes
found
it
in
greece
under
the
name
of
the
earliest
latins
in
italy
as
the
and
the
hebrews
in
palestine
as
the
it
spread
northward
through
europe
as
far
as
the
baltic
and
westward
along
the
atlas
chain
to
spain
france
and
our
own
islands
in
many
countries
it
reached
a
comparatively
high
level
of
civilization
but
in
britain
its
development
must
have
been
early
checked
we
can
discern
it
as
an
agricultural
rather
than
a
pastoral
people
still
in
the
stone
age
dwelling
in
totemistic
tribes
on
hills
whose
summits
it
fortified
elaborately
and
whose
slopes
it
cultivated
on
what
is
called
the
and
having
a
primitive
culture
which
ethnologists
think
to
have
much
resembled
that
of
the
present
of
southern
india
it
held
our
islands
till
the
coming
of
the
celts
who
fought
with
the
aborigines
dispossessed
them
of
the
more
fertile
parts
subjugated
them
even
amalgamated
with
them
but
certainly
never
extirpated
them
in
the
time
of
the
romans
they
were
still
practically
independent
in
south
wales
in
ireland
they
were
long
unconquered
and
are
found
as
allies
rather
than
serfs
of
the
gaels
ruling
their
own
provinces
and
preserving
their
own
customs
and
religion
nor
in
spite
of
all
the
successive
invasions
of
great
britain
and
ireland
are
they
yet
extinct
or
so
merged
as
to
have
lost
their
type
which
is
still
the
predominant
one
in
many
parts
of
the
west
both
of
britain
and
ireland
and
is
believed
by
some
ethnologists
to
be
generally
upon
the
increase
all
over
england
the
second
of
the
two
races
was
the
exact
opposite
to
the
first
it
was
the
tall
fair
or
people
called
popularly
the
who
belonged
in
speech
to
the
family
their
language
finding
its
affinities
in
latin
greek
teutonic
slavic
the
zend
of
ancient
persia
and
the
sanscrit
of
ancient
india
its
original
home
was
probably
somewhere
in
central
europe
along
the
course
of
the
upper
danube
or
in
the
region
of
the
alps
the
in
which
it
buried
its
dead
or
deposited
their
burnt
ashes
differ
in
shape
from
the
of
the
earlier
race
it
was
in
a
higher
stage
of
culture
than
the
and
introduced
into
britain
bronze
and
silver
and
perhaps
some
of
the
more
lately
domesticated
animals
both
iberians
and
celts
were
divided
into
numerous
tribes
but
there
is
nothing
to
show
that
there
was
any
great
diversity
among
the
former
it
is
otherwise
with
the
celts
who
were
separated
into
two
main
branches
which
came
over
at
different
times
the
earliest
were
the
goidels
or
gaels
the
second
the
brythons
or
britons
between
these
two
branches
there
was
not
only
a
dialectical
but
probably
also
a
considerable
physical
difference
some
anthropologists
even
postulate
a
different
shape
of
skull
without
necessarily
admitting
this
there
is
reason
to
suppose
a
difference
of
build
and
of
colour
of
hair
with
regard
to
this
we
have
the
evidence
of
latin
tacitus
who
tells
us
that
the
of
the
north
differed
from
the
southern
britons
in
being
and
and
of
strabo
who
described
the
tribes
in
the
interior
of
britain
as
taller
than
the
gaulish
colonists
on
the
coast
with
hair
less
yellow
and
limbs
more
loosely
knit
equally
do
the
classic
authorities
agree
in
recognizing
the
of
south
wales
as
an
entirely
different
race
from
any
other
in
britain
the
dark
complexions
and
curly
hair
of
these
iberians
seemed
to
tacitus
to
prove
them
immigrants
from
spain
professor
rhys
also
puts
forward
evidence
to
show
that
the
goidels
and
the
brythons
had
already
separated
before
they
first
left
gaul
for
our
islands
he
finds
them
as
two
distinct
peoples
there
we
do
not
expect
so
much
nowadays
from
merest
as
we
did
in
time
but
even
the
modern
descendant
of
that
paragon
could
probably
tell
us
that
all
gaul
was
divided
into
three
parts
one
of
which
was
inhabited
by
the
belgae
another
by
the
aquitani
and
the
third
by
those
who
called
themselves
celtae
but
were
termed
galli
by
the
romans
and
that
they
all
differed
from
one
another
in
language
customs
and
laws
of
these
professor
rhys
identifies
the
belgae
with
the
brythons
and
the
celtae
with
the
goidels
the
third
people
the
aquitani
being
and
part
of
the
great
iberian
stock
the
celtae
with
their
goidelic
dialect
of
celtic
which
survives
in
the
gaelic
languages
of
ireland
scotland
and
the
isle
of
man
were
the
first
to
come
over
to
britain
pushed
forward
probably
by
the
belgae
who
caesar
tells
us
were
the
bravest
of
the
gauls
here
they
conquered
the
native
iberians
driving
them
out
of
the
fertile
parts
into
the
rugged
districts
of
the
north
and
west
later
came
the
belgae
themselves
compelled
by
press
of
population
and
they
bringing
better
weapons
and
a
higher
civilization
treated
the
goidels
as
those
had
treated
the
iberians
thus
harried
the
goidels
probably
combined
with
the
iberians
against
what
was
now
the
common
foe
and
became
to
a
large
degree
amalgamated
with
them
the
result
was
that
during
the
roman
domination
the
british
islands
were
roughly
divided
with
regard
to
race
as
follows
the
brythons
or
second
celtic
race
held
all
britain
south
of
the
tweed
with
the
exception
of
the
extreme
west
while
the
first
celtic
race
the
goidelic
had
most
of
ireland
as
well
as
the
isle
of
man
cumberland
the
west
highlands
cornwall
devon
and
north
wales
north
of
the
grampians
lived
the
picts
who
were
probably
more
or
less
goidelicized
iberians
the
aboriginal
race
also
holding
out
unmixed
in
south
wales
and
parts
of
ireland
it
is
now
time
to
decide
what
for
the
purposes
of
this
book
it
will
be
best
to
call
the
two
different
branches
of
the
celts
and
their
languages
with
such
familiar
terms
as
and
and
ready
to
our
hands
it
seems
pedantic
to
insist
upon
the
more
technical
and
and
the
difficulty
is
that
the
words
and
have
been
so
long
popularly
used
to
designate
only
the
modern
of
scotland
and
their
language
that
they
may
create
confusion
when
also
applied
to
the
people
and
languages
of
ireland
and
the
isle
of
man
similarly
the
words
and
have
come
to
mean
at
the
present
day
the
people
of
the
whole
of
the
british
islands
though
they
at
first
only
signified
the
inhabitants
of
england
central
wales
the
lowlands
of
scotland
and
the
brythonic
colony
in
brittany
however
the
words
and
with
their
derivatives
are
so
clumsy
that
it
will
probably
prove
best
to
use
the
neater
terms
in
this
volume
therefore
the
of
ireland
scotland
and
the
isle
of
man
are
our
and
the
of
england
and
wales
are
our
we
get
the
earliest
accounts
of
the
life
of
the
inhabitants
of
the
british
islands
from
two
sources
the
first
is
a
foreign
one
that
of
the
latin
writers
but
the
romans
only
really
knew
the
southern
britons
whom
they
describe
as
similar
in
physique
and
customs
to
the
continental
gauls
with
whom
indeed
they
considered
them
to
be
identical
at
the
time
they
wrote
colonies
of
belgae
were
still
settling
upon
the
coasts
of
britain
opposite
to
gaul
roman
information
grew
scantier
as
it
approached
the
wall
and
of
the
northern
tribes
they
seem
to
have
had
only
such
knowledge
as
they
gathered
through
occasional
warfare
with
them
they
describe
them
as
entirely
barbarous
naked
and
tattooed
living
by
the
chase
alone
without
towns
houses
or
fields
without
government
or
family
life
and
regarding
iron
as
an
ornament
of
value
as
other
more
civilized
peoples
regarded
gold
as
for
ireland
it
never
came
under
their
direct
observation
and
we
are
entirely
dependent
upon
its
native
writers
for
information
as
to
the
manners
and
customs
of
the
gaels
it
may
be
considered
convincing
proof
of
the
authenticity
of
the
descriptions
of
life
contained
in
the
ancient
gaelic
manuscripts
that
they
corroborate
so
completely
the
observations
of
the
latin
writers
upon
the
britons
and
gauls
reading
the
two
side
by
side
we
may
largely
reconstruct
the
common
civilization
of
the
celts
roughly
speaking
one
may
compare
it
with
the
civilization
of
the
greeks
as
described
by
homer
both
peoples
were
in
the
tribal
and
pastoral
stage
of
culture
in
which
the
chiefs
are
the
great
round
whom
their
less
wealthy
fellows
gather
both
wear
much
the
same
attire
use
the
same
kind
of
weapons
and
fight
in
the
same
the
a
vehicle
already
obsolete
even
in
ireland
by
the
first
century
of
the
christian
era
battles
are
fought
between
chiefs
the
common
people
contributing
little
to
their
result
and
less
to
their
history
such
chiefs
are
said
to
be
divinely
even
of
the
immortal
gods
their
tremendous
feats
are
sung
by
the
bards
who
like
the
homeric
poets
were
privileged
persons
inferior
only
to
the
ancient
greek
and
ancient
celt
had
very
much
the
same
conceptions
of
life
both
as
regards
this
world
and
the
next
we
may
gather
much
detailed
information
of
the
early
inhabitants
of
the
british
islands
from
our
various
authorities
their
clothes
which
consisted
according
to
the
latin
writers
of
a
blouse
with
sleeves
trousers
fitting
closely
round
the
ankles
and
a
shawl
or
cloak
fastened
at
the
shoulder
with
a
brooch
were
made
either
of
thick
felt
or
of
woven
cloth
dyed
with
various
brilliant
colours
the
writer
diodorus
tells
us
that
they
were
crossed
with
little
squares
and
lines
though
they
had
been
sprinkled
with
they
were
in
fact
like
and
we
may
believe
varro
who
tells
us
that
they
a
gaudy
the
men
alone
seem
to
have
worn
hats
which
were
of
soft
felt
the
hair
being
uncovered
and
tied
in
a
knot
behind
in
time
of
battle
the
men
also
dispensed
with
any
brushing
their
abundant
hair
forward
into
a
thick
mass
and
dyeing
it
red
with
a
soap
made
of
fat
and
beech
ashes
until
they
looked
says
tutor
posidonius
who
visited
britain
about
less
like
human
beings
than
wild
men
of
the
woods
both
sexes
were
fond
of
ornaments
which
took
the
form
of
gold
bracelets
rings
pins
and
brooches
and
of
beads
of
amber
glass
and
jet
their
knives
daggers
axes
and
swords
were
made
of
bronze
or
iron
their
shields
were
the
same
round
target
used
by
the
highlanders
at
the
battle
of
culloden
and
they
seem
also
to
have
had
a
kind
of
lasso
to
which
a
ball
was
attached
and
which
they
used
as
the
gauchos
of
south
america
use
their
their
were
made
of
wicker
the
wooden
wheels
being
armed
with
sickles
of
bronze
these
were
drawn
either
by
two
or
four
horses
and
were
large
enough
to
hold
several
persons
in
each
standing
in
these
they
rushed
along
the
lines
hurling
darts
and
driving
the
scythes
against
all
who
came
within
reach
the
romans
were
much
impressed
by
the
skill
of
the
drivers
who
check
their
horses
at
full
speed
on
a
steep
incline
and
turn
them
in
an
instant
and
could
run
along
the
pole
and
stand
on
the
yoke
and
then
get
back
into
their
chariots
again
without
a
with
these
accounts
of
the
roman
writers
we
may
compare
the
picture
of
the
gaelic
hero
cuchulainn
as
the
ancient
irish
writers
describe
him
dressed
and
armed
for
battle
glorified
by
the
bard
he
yet
wears
essentially
the
same
costume
and
equipment
which
the
classic
historians
and
geographers
described
more
soberly
gorgeous
raiment
that
he
wore
in
great
consisted
of
fair
crimson
tunic
of
five
plies
and
fringed
with
a
long
pin
of
white
silver
and
patterned
shining
as
if
it
had
been
a
luminous
torch
which
for
its
blazing
property
and
brilliance
men
might
not
endure
to
see
next
his
skin
a
of
silk
bordered
and
fringed
all
round
with
gold
with
silver
and
with
white
bronze
which
vest
came
as
far
as
the
upper
edge
of
his
kilt
about
his
neck
were
a
hundred
linklets
of
red
gold
that
flashed
again
with
pendants
hanging
from
them
his

adorned
with
a
hundred
mixed
carbuncle
jewels
he
carried
trusty
special
shield
in
hue
dark
crimson
and
in
its
circumference
armed
with
a
pure
white
silver
rim
at
his
left
side
a
long
and
sword
beside
him
in
the
chariot
a
lengthy
spear
together
with
a
keen
javelin
fitted
with
hurling
thong
with
rivets

another
passage
of
gaelic
saga
describes
his
chariot
it
was
made
of
fine
wood
with
moving
on
wheels
of
white
bronze
it
had
a
high
rounded
frame
of
creaking
copper
a
strong
curved
yoke
of
gold
and
a
pole
of
white
silver
with
mountings
of
white
bronze
the
yellow
reins
were
plaited
and
the
shafts
were
as
hard
and
straight
as
in
like
manner
the
ancient
irish
writers
have
made
glorious
the
halls
and
fortresses
of
their
mythical
kings
like
the
palaces
of
priam
of
menelaus
and
of
odysseus
they
gleam
with
gold
and
gems
conchobar
the
legendary
king
of
ulster
in
its
golden
age
had
three
such
at
emain
macha
of
the
one
called
the
we
are
told
that
it
contained
nine
compartments
of
red
yew
partitioned
by
walls
of
bronze
all
grouped
around
the
private
chamber
which
had
a
ceiling
of
silver
and
bronze
pillars
adorned
with
gold
and
carbuncles
but
the
far
less
magnificent
accounts
of
the
latin
writers
have
no
doubt
more
truth
in
them
than
such
lavish
pictures
they
described
the
britons
they
knew
as
living
in
villages
of
huts
roofed
with
fern
or
thatch
from
which
at
the
approach
of
an
enemy
they
retired
to
the
local
this
so
far
from
being
elaborate
merely
consisted
of
a
round
or
oval
space
fenced
in
with
palisades
and
earthworks
and
situated
either
upon
the
top
of
a
hill
or
in
the
midst
of
a
not
easily
traversable
morass
we
may
see
the
remains
of
such
strongholds
in
many
parts
of
ones
are
the
of
amesbury
avebury
and
old
sarum
in
wiltshire
saint
hill
near
winchester
and
saint
hill
in
it
is
probable
that
in
spite
of
the
celtic
praisers
of
past
days
the
of
emain
macha
and
of
tara
were
very
like
them
the
celtic
customs
were
like
the
homeric
those
of
the
primitive
world
all

though
it
may
have
theoretically
belonged
to
the
chief

cultivated
in
common
this
community
of
possessions
is
stated
by
caesar
to
have
extended
to
their
wives
but
the
imputation
can
not
be
said
to
have
been
proved
on
the
contrary
in
the
stories
of
both
branches
of
the
celtic
race
women
seem
to
have
taken
a
higher
place
in
estimation
and
to
have
enjoyed
far
more
personal
liberty
than
among
the
homeric
greeks
the
idea
may
have
arisen
from
a
misunderstanding
of
some
of
the
curious
celtic
customs
descent
seems
to
have
been
traced
through
the
maternal
rather
than
through
the
paternal
line
a
very
procedure
which
some
believe
to
have
been
borrowed
from
another
race
the
parental
relation
was
still
further
lessened
by
the
custom
of
sending
children
to
be
brought
up
outside
the
family
in
which
they
were
born
so
that
they
had
to
whom
they
were
as
much
or
even
more
attached
than
to
their
natural
ones
their
political
state
mirroring
their
family
life
was
not
less
primitive
there
was
no
central
tribunal
disputes
were
settled
within
the
families
in
which
they
occurred
while
in
the
case
of
graver
injuries
the
injured
party
or
his
nearest
relation
could
kill
the
culprit
or
exact
a
fine
from
him
as
families
increased
in
number
they
became
petty
tribes
often
at
war
with
one
another
a
defeated
tribe
had
to
recognize
the
sovereignty
of
the
head
man
of
the
conquering
tribe
and
a
succession
of
such
victories
exalted
him
into
the
position
of
a
chief
of
his
district
but
even
then
though
his
decision
was
the
whole
of
the
law
he
was
little
more
than
the
mouthpiece
of
public
opinion

the

and

been
already
described
as
forming
a
branch
of
what
are
roughly
called
the
this
name
has
however
little
reference
to
race
and
really
signifies
the
speakers
of
a
group
of
languages
which
can
be
all
shown
to
be
connected
and
to
descend
remotely
from
a
single
hypothetical
spoken
by
a
hypothetical
people
which
we
term
or
more
correctly
this
primeval
speech
evolved
probably
upon
some
part
of
the
great
plain
which
stretches
from
the
mountains
of
central
europe
to
the
mountains
of
central
asia
has
spread
superseding
or
amalgamating
with
the
tongues
of
other
races
until
branches
of
it
are
spoken
over
almost
the
whole
of
europe
and
a
great
portion
of
asia
all
the
various
latin
greek
slavic
teutonic
and
celtic
languages
are
as
well
as
persian
and
other
asiatic
dialects
derived
from
the
ancient
and
the
numerous
indian
languages
which
trace
their
origin
to
sanscrit
not
very
long
ago
it
was
supposed
that
this
common
descent
of
language
involved
a
common
descent
of
blood
a
real
brotherhood
was
enthusiastically
claimed
for
all
the
principal
european
nations
who
were
also
invited
to
recognize
hindus
and
persians
as
their
cousins
since
then
it
has
been
conceded
that
while
the
aryan
speech
survived
though
greatly
modified
the
aryan
blood
might
well
have
disappeared
diluted
beyond
recognition
by
crossing
with
the
other
races
whom
the
aryans
conquered
or
among
whom
they
more
or
less
peacefully
settled
as
a
matter
of
fact
there
are
no
european
no
people
at
all
except
a
few
remote
savage
are
not
made
up
of
the
most
diverse
elements
aryan
and
long
ago
blended
inextricably
to
form
by
their
fusion
new
peoples
but
just
as
the
aryan
speech
influenced
the
new
languages
and
the
aryan
customs
the
new
civilizations
so
we
can
still
discern
in
the
religions
of
the
nations
similar
ideas
and
expressions
pointing
to
an
original
source
of
mythological
conceptions
hence
whether
we
investigate
the
mythology
of
the
hindus
the
greeks
the
teutons
or
the
celts
we
find
the
same
mythological
groundwork
in
each
we
see
the
powers
of
nature
personified
and
endowed
with
human
form
and
attributes
though
bearing
with
few
exceptions
different
names
like
the
vedic
brahmans
the
greek
and
latin
poets
and
the
norse
scalds
the
celtic
gaels
or
the
sky
the
sun
the
moon
the
earth
the
sea
and
the
dark
underworld
as
well
as
the
mountains
the
streams
and
the
woods
to
be
ruled
by
beings
like
their
own
chiefs
but
infinitely
more
powerful
every
passion
as
war
and
love
and
every
art
as
poetry
and
smithcraft
had
its
divine
founder
teacher
and
exponent
and
of
all
these
deities
and
their
imagined
children
they
wove
the
poetical
and
allegorical
romances
which
form
the
subject
of
the
present
volume
like
other
nations
too
whether
aryan
or
the
celts
had
besides
their
mythology
a
religion
it
is
not
enough
to
tell
tales
of
shadowy
gods
they
must
be
made
visible
by
sculpture
housed
in
groves
or
temples
served
with
ritual
and
propitiated
with
sacrifices
if
one
is
to
hope
for
their
favours
every
cult
must
have
its
priests
living
by
the
altar
the
priests
of
the
celts
are
to
us
by
name
as
the
word
derived
from
a
root
dr
which
signifies
a
tree
and
especially
the
oak
in
several
aryan
languages
this
is
not
by
all
as
proving
that
they
paid
an
especial
veneration
to
the
king
of
trees
it
is
true
that
the
strange
parasite
upon
the
prominent
among
their
of
and
played
a
part
in
their
ritual
but
this
is
equally
true
of
other
aryan
nations
by
the
norse
it
was
held
sacred
to
the
god
balder
while
the
romans
believed
it
to
be
the
that
gave
access
to
hades
the
accounts
both
of
the
latin
and
gaelic
writers
give
us
a
fairly
complete
idea
of
the
nature
of
the
druids
and
especially
of
the
high
estimation
in
which
they
were
held
they
were
at
once
the
priests
the
physicians
the
wizards
the
diviners
the
theologians
the
scientists
and
the
historians
of
their
tribes
all
spiritual
power
and
all
human
knowledge
were
vested
in
them
and
they
ranked
second
only
to
the
kings
and
chiefs
they
were
freed
from
all
contribution
to
the
state
whether
by
tribute
or
service
in
war
so
that
they
might
the
better
apply
themselves
to
their
divine
offices
their
decisions
were
absolutely
final
and
those
who
disobeyed
them
were
laid
under
a
terrible
excommunication
or
classic
writers
tell
us
how
they
lorded
it
in
gaul
where
no
doubt
they
borrowed
splendour
by
imitating
their
more
civilized
neighbours
men
of
the
highest
rank
were
proud
to
cast
aside
the
insignia
of
mere
mortal
honour
to
join
the
company
of
those
who
claimed
to
be
the
direct
mediators
with
the
and
the
and
who
must
have
resembled
the
ecclesiastics
of
mediæval
europe
in
the
days
of
their
greatest
power
combining
like
them
spiritual
and
temporal
dignities
and
possessing
the
highest
culture
of
their
age
yet
it
was
not
among
these
druids
of
gaul
with
their
splendid
temples
and
vestments
and
their
elaborate
rituals
that
the
metropolis
of
druidism
was
to
be
sought
we
learn
from
caesar
that
the
gallic
druids
believed
their
religion
to
have
come
to
them
originally
from
britain
and
that
it
was
their
practice
to
send
their
across
the
channel
to
learn
its
doctrines
at
their
purest
source
to
trace
a
cult
backwards
is
often
to
take
a
retrograde
course
in
culture
and
it
was
no
doubt
in
pliny
the
elder
tells
us
have
taught
magic
to
the
sufficiently
primitive
and
savage
rites
of
the
druids
of
gaul
were
preserved
in
their
still
more
savage
and
primitive
forms
it
is
curious
corroboration
of
this
alleged
british
origin
of
druidism
that
the
ancient
irish
also
believed
their
druidism
to
have
come
from
the
sister
island
their
heroes
and
seers
are
described
as
only
gaining
the
highest
knowledge
by
travelling
to
alba
however
this
may
be
we
may
take
it
as
certain
that
this
druidism
was
the
accepted
religion
of
the
celtic
race
certain
scholars
look
deeper
for
its
origin
holding
its
dark
superstitions
and
savage
rites
to
bear
the
stamp
of
lower
minds
than
those
of
the
poetic
and
manly
celts
professor
rhys
inclines
to
see
three
forms
of
religion
in
the
british
islands
at
the
time
of
the
roman
invasion
the
of
the
iberian
aborigines
the
pure
polytheism
of
the
brythons
who
having
come
later
into
the
country
had
mixed
but
little
with
the
natives
and
the
mingled
aryan
and
cults
of
the
goidels
who
were
already
largely
amalgamated
with
them
but
many
authorities
dissent
from
this
view
and
indeed
we
are
not
obliged
to
postulate
borrowing
from
tribes
in
a
lower
state
of
culture
to
explain
primitive
and
savage
features
underlying
a
higher
religion
the
nations
must
have
passed
equally
with
all
others
through
a
state
of
pure
savagery
and
we
know
that
the
religion
of
the
greeks
in
many
respects
so
lofty
sheltered
features
and
legends
as
barbarous
as
any
that
can
be
attributed
to
the
celts
of
the
famous
teaching
of
the
druids
we
know
little
owing
to
their
habit
of
never
allowing
their
doctrines
to
be
put
into
writing
caesar
however
roughly
records
its
scope
one
of
their
leading
he
says
inculcate
this
that
souls
are
not
annihilated
but
pass
after
death
from
one
body
to
another
and
they
hold
that
by
this
teaching
men
are
much
encouraged
to
valour
through
disregarding
the
fear
of
death
they
also
discuss
and
impart
to
the
young
many
things
concerning
the
heavenly
bodies
and
their
movements
the
size
of
the
world
and
of
our
earth
natural
science
and
of
the
influence
and
power
of
the
immortal
the
romans
seem
to
have
held
their
wisdom
in
some
awe
though
it
is
not
unlikely
that
the
druids
themselves
borrowed
whatever
knowledge
they
may
have
had
of
science
and
philosophy
from
the
classical
culture
that
their
creed
of
transmigration
was
not
however
merely
taken
over
from
the
greeks
seems
certain
from
its
appearance
in
the
ancient
gaelic
myths
not
only
the
common
to
the
magic
stories
of
all
nations
but
actual
reincarnation
was
in
the
power
of
privileged
beings
the
hero
cuchulainn
was
urged
by
the
men
of
ulster
to
marry
because
they
knew
his
rebirth
would
be
of
and
they
did
not
wish
so
great
a
warrior
to
be
lost
to
their
tribe
another
legend
tells
how
the
famous
finn
mac
coul
was
reborn
after
two
hundred
years
as
an
ulster
king
called
mongan
such
ideas
however
belonged
to
the
metaphysical
side
of
druidism
far
more
important
to
the
practical
primitive
mind
are
ritual
and
sacrifice
by
the
due
performance
of
which
the
gods
are
persuaded
or
compelled
to
grant
increase
and
length
of
days
to
men
among
the
druids
this
humouring
of
the
divinities
took
the
shape
of
human
sacrifice
and
that
upon
a
scale
which
would
seem
to
have
been
unsurpassed
in
horror
even
by
the
most
savage
tribes
of
west
africa
or
polynesia
whole
gaulish
says
caesar
to
a
great
degree
devoted
to
superstitious
rites
and
on
this
account
those
who
are
afflicted
with
severe
diseases
or
who
are
engaged
in
battles
and
dangers
either
sacrifice
human
beings
for
victims
or
vow
that
they
will
immolate
themselves
and
these
employ
the
druids
as
ministers
for
such
sacrifices
because
they
think
that
unless
the
life
of
man
be
repaid
for
the
life
of
man
the
will
of
the
immortal
gods
can
not
be
appeased
they
also
ordain
national
offerings
of
the
same
kind
others
make
images
of
vast
size
the
limbs
of
which
they
fill
with
living
men
and
set
on
we
find
evidence
of
similarly
awful
customs
in
pagan
ireland
among
the
oldest
gaelic
records
are
tracts
called
in
which
famous
places
are
enumerated
together
with
the
legends
relating
to
them
such
topographies
are
found
in
several
of
the
great
irish
mediæval
manuscripts
and
therefore
of
course
received
their
final
transcription
at
the
hands
of
christian
monks
but
these
ecclesiastics
rarely
tampered
with
compositions
in
elaborate
verse
nor
can
it
be
imagined
that
any
monastic
scribe
could
have
invented
such
a
legend
as
this
one
which
describes
the
practice
of
human
sacrifice
among
the
ancient
irish
the
poem
which
is
found
in
the
books
of
leinster
of
ballymote
of
lecan
and
in
a
document
called

rennes

reason
why
a
spot
near
the

village
of

in

the
name

destroyed
without

the
feeble
idol
which
was
such
we
gather
from
a
tradition
which
we
may
deem
authentic
was
human
sacrifice
in
early
ireland
according
to
the
quoted
verse
one
third
of
the
healthy
children
were
slaughtered
presumably
every
year
to
wrest
from
the
powers
of
nature
the
grain
and
grass
upon
which
the
tribes
and
their
cattle
subsisted
in
a
prose
preserved
in
the
rennes
there
is
a
slight
variant
at
mag
slecht
it
runs
the
king
idol
of
erin
namely
the
crom
croich
and
around
him
were
twelve
idols
made
of
stones
but
he
was
of
gold
until
advent
he
was
the
god
of
every
folk
that
colonized
ireland
to
him
they
used
to
offer
the
firstlings
of
every
issue
and
the
chief
scions
of
every
the
same
authority
also
tells
us
that
these
sacrifices
were
made
at
which
took
the
place
in
the
christian
calendar
of
the
heathen
the
power
waned
and
the
strength
of
the
gods
of
darkness
winter
and
the
underworld
grew
great
who
then
was
this
bloodthirsty
deity
his
name
means
the
one
of
the
and
was
evidently
applied
to
him
only
after
his
fall
from
godhead
it
relates
to
the
tradition
that
at
the
approach
of
the
saint
patrick
the
fled
from
his
golden
image
which
thereupon
sank
forward
in
the
earth
in
homage
to
the
power
that
had
come
to
supersede
it
but
from
another
source
we
glean
that
the
word
was
a
kind
of
pun
upon
and
that
the
real
title
of
the
idol
of
was
or
of
the
mound
professor
rhys
in
his
suggests
that
he
was
probably
the
gaelic
worshipped
like
the
hellenic
zeus
upon
natural
or
artificial
at
any
rate
we
may
see
in
him
the
god
most
revered
by
the
gaels
surrounded
by
the

twelve
chief
members
of

it
would
appear
probable
that
the
celtic
state
worship
was
what
is
called
all
its
chief
festivals
related
to
points
in
the
progress
the
equinoxes
having
been
considered
more
important
than
the
solstices
it
was
at
the
spring
equinox
called
by
the
celts
in
every
nineteenth
year
that
we
learn
from
diodorus
the
sicilian
a
writer
contemporary
with

caesar
apollo
himself
appeared
to
his
worshippers
and
was
seen
harping
and
dancing
in
the
sky
until
the
rising
of
the
pleiades
the
other
corresponding
festival
was
the
autumn
equinox
as
beltaine
marked
the
beginning
of
summer
so
samhain
recorded
its
end
the
summer
solstice
was
also
a
great
celtic
feast
it
was
held
at
the
beginning
of
august
in
honour
of
the
god
called
lugus
by
the
gauls
lugh
by
the
gaels
and
lleu
by
the
apollo
and
probably
when
the
cult
of
the
had
fallen
from
its
early
prominence
the
chief
figure
of
the
common
pantheon
it
was
doubtless
at
stonehenge
that
the
british
apollo
was
thus
seen
harping
and
dancing
that
marvellous
structure
well
corresponds
to
description
of
a
temple
of
which
he
locates
the
centre
of
is
a
circular
enclosure
he
says
with
votive
offerings
and
tablets
with
greek
inscriptions
suspended
by
travellers
upon
the
walls
the
rulers
of
the
temple
and
city
are
called
and
they
take
up
the
government
from
each
other
according
to
the
order
of
their
tribes
the
citizens
are
given
up
to
music
harping
and
chanting
in
honour
of
the
stonehenge
therefore
was
a
sacred
religious
centre
equally
revered
by
and
equally
belonging
to
all
the
british
rome
or
jerusalem
of
our
ancient
paganism
the
same
great
gods
were
no
doubt
adored
by
all
the
celts
not
only
of
great
britain
and
ireland
but
of
continental
gaul
as
well
sometimes
they
can
be
traced
by
name
right
across
the
ancient
celtic
world
in
other
cases
what
is
obviously
the
same
personified
power
of
nature
is
found
in
various
places
with
the
same
attributes
but
with
a
different
title
besides
these
there
must
have
been
a
multitude
of
lesser
gods
worshipped
by
certain
tribes
alone
to
whom
they
stood
as
ancestors
and
guardians
swear
by
the
gods
of
my
was
the
ordinary
oath
of
a
hero
in
the
ancient
gaelic
sagas
the
aboriginal
tribes
must
also
have
had
their
gods
whether
it
be
true
or
not
that
their
religion
influenced
the
celtic
druidism
professor
rhys
inclines
to
see
in
the
the
almost
nameless
spirits
of
well
and
river
mountain
and
remnants
of
whose
cults
survive
of
a
swarming
pantheon
of
the
older
iberians
these
local
beings
would
in
no
way
conflict
with
the
great
celtic
and
the
two
worships
could
exist
side
by
side
both
even
claiming
the
same
votary
it
needs
the
stern
faith
of
monotheism
to
deny
the
existence
of
the
gods
of
others
polytheistic
nations
have
seldom
or
never
risen
to
such
a
height
in
their
dealings
with
a
conquered
people
the
conquerors
naturally
held
their
own
gods
to
be
the
stronger
still
it
could
not
be
denied
that
the
gods
of
the
conquered
were
upon
their
own
ground
they
knew
so
to
speak
the
country
and
might
have
unguessed
powers
of
doing
evil
what
if
to
avenge
their
worshippers
and
themselves
they
were
to
make
the
land
barren
and
useless
to
the
conquerors
so
that
conquering
pagan
nations
have
usually
been
quite
ready
to
stretch
out
the
hand
of
welcome
to
the
deities
of
their
new
subjects
to
propitiate
them
by
sacrifice
and
even
to
admit
them
within
the
pale
of
their
own
pantheon
this
raises
the
question
of
the
exact
nationality
of
the
gods
whose
stories
we
are
about
to
tell
were
they
all
aryan
or
did
any
of
the
greater
aboriginal
deities
climb
up
to
take
their
place
among
the
gaelic
tribe
of
the
goddess
danu
or
the
british
children
of
the
goddess
dôn
some
of
the
celtic
gods
have
seemed
to
scholars
to
bear
signs
of
a
origin
the
point
however
is
at
present
very
obscure
neither
does
it
much
concern
us
just
as
the
diverse
deities
of
the
aryan
and
hellenic
some
and
pelasgian
some
imported
and
all
gathered
into
one
great
divine
family
so
we
may
consider
as
members

v
the
gods
of
the
gaels
of
the
two
celtic
races
that
settled
in
our
islands
it
is
the
earlier
the
gaels
that
has
best
preserved
its
old
mythology
it
is
true
that
we
have
in
few
cases
such
detailed
account
of
the
gaelic
gods
as
we
gain
of
the
hellenic
deities
from
the
greek
poets
of
the
indian
devas
from
the
rig
veda
or
of
the
norse
æsir
from
the
eddas
yet
none
the
less
may
we
draw
from
the
ancient
irish
manuscripts
quite
enough
information
to
enable
us
to
set
forth
their
figures
with
some
clearness
we
find
them
as
might
have
been
anticipated
very
much
like
the
divine
hierarchies
of
other
aryan
peoples
we
also
find
them
separated
into
two
opposing
camps
a
division
common
to
all
the
aryan
religions
just
as
the
olympians
struggled
with
the
giants
the
æsir
fought
the
jötuns
and
the
devas
the
asuras
so
there
is
warfare
in
the
gaelic
spiritual
world
between
two
superhuman
hosts
on
one
side
are
ranged
the
gods
of
day
light
life
fertility
wisdom
and
good
on
the
other
the
demons
of
night
darkness
death
barrenness
and
evil
the
first
were
the
great
spirits
symbolizing
the
beneficial
aspects
of
nature
and
the
arts
and
intelligence
of
man
the
second
were
the
hostile
powers
thought
to
be
behind
such
baneful
manifestations
as
storm
and
fog
drought
and
disease
the
first
are
ranged
as
a
divine
family
round
a
goddess
called
danu
from
whom
they
took
their
name
of
dé
or
of
the
goddess
the
second
owned
allegiance
to
a
female
divinity
called
domnu
their
king
indech
is
described
as
her
son
and
they
are
all
called
the
word
appears
to
have
signified
the
abyss
or
the
deep
sea
and
the
same
idea
is
also
expressed
in
their
name
of
derived
from
two
gaelic
words
meaning
the
waste
of
water
seems
to
have
always
impressed
the
celts
with
the
sense
of
primeval
ancientness
it
was
connected
in
their
minds
with
vastness
darkness
and
monstrous
very
antithesis
of
all
that
was
symbolized
by
the
earth
the
sky
and
the
sun
therefore
the
fomors
were
held
to
be
more
ancient
than
the
gods
before
whom
they
were
however
destined
to
fall
in
the
end
offspring
of
and
old
they
were
for
the
most
part
huge
and
deformed
some
had
but
one
arm
and
one
leg
apiece
while
others
had
the
heads
of
goats
horses
or
bulls
the
most
famous
and
perhaps
the
most
terrible
of
them
all
was
balor
whose
father
is
said
to
have
been
one
buarainech
that
is
the
and
who
combined
in
himself
the
two
classical
rôles
of
the
cyclops
and
the
medusa
though
he
had
two
eyes
one
was
always
kept
shut
for
it
was
so
venomous
that
it
slew
anyone
on
whom
its
look
fell
this
malignant
quality
of
eye
was
not
natural
to
him
but
was
the
result
of
an
accident
urged
by
curiosity
he
once
looked
in
at
the
window
of
a
house
where
his
sorcerers
were
preparing
a
magic
potion
and
the
poisonous
smoke
from
the
cauldron
reached
his
eye
infecting
it
with
so
much
of
its
own
deadly
nature
as
to
make
it
disastrous
to
others
neither
god
nor
giant
seems
to
have
been
exempt
from
its
dangers
so
that
balor
was
only
allowed
to
live
on
condition
that
he
kept
his
terrible
eye
shut
on
days
of
battle
he
was
placed
opposite
to
the
enemy
the
lid
of
the
destroying
eye
was
lifted
up
with
a
hook
and
its
gaze
withered
all
who
stood
before
it
the
memory
of
balor
and
his
eye
still
lingers
in
ireland
the
of
is
the
name
for
what
the
peasantry
of
other
countries
call
the
stories
are
still
told
of
or
of
the
mighty
and
is
the
name
of
a
curious
cliff
on
tory
island
this
island
off
the
coast
of
donegal
was
the
fomorian
outpost
upon
earth
their
real
abode
being
in
the
cold
depths
of
the
sea
this
rule
however
as
to
the
hideousness
of
the
fomors
had
its
exceptions
elathan
one
of
their
chiefs
is
described
in
an
old
manuscript
as
of
magnificent
miltonic
prince
of
darkness
man
of
fairest
form
it
says
golden
hair
down
to
his
shoulders
he
wore
a
mantle
of
gold
braid
over
a
shirt
interwoven
with
threads
of
gold
five
golden
necklaces
were
round
his
neck
and
a
brooch
of
gold
with
a
shining
precious
stone
thereon
was
on
his
breast
he
carried
two
silver
spears
with
rivets
of
bronze
and
his
sword
was
and
nor
was
his
son
less
handsome
his
name
was
bress
which
means
and
we
are
told
that
every
beautiful
thing
in
ireland
plain
or
fortress
or
ale
or
torch
or
woman
or
was
compared
with
him
so
that
men
said
of
them
is
a
balor
bress
and
elathan
are
the
three
fomorian
personages
whose
figures
seen
through
the
mists
of
antiquity
show
clearest
to
us
but
they
are
only
a
few
out
of
many
nor
are
they
the
oldest
we
can
learn
however
nothing
but
a
few
names
of
any
ancestors
of
the
gaelic
giants
this
is
equally
true
of
the
gaelic
gods
those
we
know
are
evidently
not
without
parentage
but
the
names
of
their
fathers
are
no
more
than
shadows
following
into
oblivion
the
figures
they
designated
the
most
ancient
divinity
of
whom
we
have
any
knowledge
is
danu
herself
the
goddess
from
whom
the
whole
hierarchy
of
gods
received
its
name
of
tuatha
dé
danann
she
was
also
called
anu
or
ana
and
her
name
still
clings
to
two
mountains
near
killarney
which
though
now
called
simply
were
known
formerly
as
the
of
she
was
the
universal
mother
she
used
to
cherish
the
says
the
commentator
of
a
irish
glossary
her
husband
is
never
mentioned
by
name
but
one
may
assume
him
from
british
analogies
to
have
been
bilé
known
to
gaelic
tradition
as
a
god
of
hades
a
kind
of
celtic
dis
pater
from
whom
sprang
the
first
men
danu
herself
probably
represented
the
earth
and
its
fruitfulness
and
one
might
compare
her
with
the
greek
demeter
all
the
other
gods
are
at
least
by
title
her
children
the
greatest
of
these
would
seem
to
have
been
nuada
called
or
of
the
silver
he
was
at
once
the
gaelic
zeus
or
jupiter
and
their
for
among
primitive
nations
to
whom
success
in
war
is
the
god
of
battles
is
the
supreme
god
among
the
gauls
camulus
whose
name
meant
was
identified
by
the
romans
with
mars
and
other
such
instances
come
readily
to
the
mind
he
was
possessed
of
an
invincible
sword
one
of
the
four
chief
treasures
of
the
tuatha
dé
danann
over
whom
he
was
twice
king
and
there
is
little
doubt
that
he
was
one
of
the
most
important
gods
of
both
the
gaels
and
the
britons
for
his
name
is
spread
over
the
whole
of
the
british
isles
which
we
may
surmise
the
celts
conquered
under
his
auspices
we
may
picture
him
as
a
more
savage
mars
delighting
in
battle
and
slaughter
and
worshipped
like
his
gaulish
affinities
teutates
and
hesus
of
whom
the
latin
poet
lucan
tells
us
with
human
sacrifices
shared
in
by
his
female
consorts
who
we
may
imagine
were
not
more
merciful
than
himself
or
than
that
gaulish
taranis
whose
cult
was
gentler
than
that
of
the
scythian
and
who
completes

as
a
fit
companion
to

and
the
of
these
warlike
goddesses

were
the
nemon
the

the
macha
a
personification
of

over
all
of
them
the
morrígú
or
this
supreme
of
the
gaels
who
resembles
a
fiercer
herê
perhaps
symbolized
the
moon
deemed
by
early
races
to
have
preceded
the
sun
and
worshipped
with
magical
and
cruel
rites

is
represented
as
going
fully
armed

carrying
two
spears
in

battle

gruesome
picture
of
what

believed

happen
in

world

aflame

which
was
shrieking

there
arose
also
the
satyrs

maniacs
of
the
valleys
and
the
witches
and
goblins
and
owls
and
destroying
demons
of
the
air
and

and
the
demoniac
phantom

they
were
inciting

sustaining
valour
and
battle
with
when
the
fight
was
over
they
revelled
among
the
bodies
of
the
slain
the
heads
cut
off

in
which
everyone
found
food
in
proportion
to
his
merits
and
from
which
none
went
away
unsatisfied
he
also
had
a
living
harp
as
he
played
upon
it
the
seasons
came
in
their
following
winter
and
summer
succeeding
spring
autumn
coming
after
summer
and
in
its
turn
giving
place
to
winter
he
is
represented
as
of
venerable
aspect
and
of
simple
mind
and
tastes
very
fond
of
porridge
and
a
valiant
consumer
of
it
in
an
ancient
tale
we
have
a
description
of
his
dress
he
wore
a
brown
tunic
which
only
reached
down
to
his
hips
and
over
this
a
hooded
cape
which
barely
covered
his
shoulders
on
his
feet
and
legs
were
boots
the
hairy
side
outwards
he
carried
or
rather
drew
after
him
on
a
wheel
an
so
huge
that
eight
men
would
have
been
needed
to
carry
it
and
the
wheel
as
he
towed
the
whole
weapon
along
made
a
track
like
a
territorial
boundary
ancient
and
as
he
was
and
sturdy
it
will
be
seen
from
this
that
he
was
a
formidable
fighter
he
did
great
deeds
in
the
battle
between
the
gods
and
the
fomors
and
on
one
occasion
is
even
said
to
have
captured
a
and
monster
called
mata
dragged
him
to
the
of
near
the
boyne
and
killed
him
there
the
wife
was
called
boann
she
was
connected
in
legend
with
the
river
boyne
to
which
she
gave
its
name
and
indeed
its
very
existence
formerly
there
was
only
a
well
shaded
by
nine
magic
these
trees
bore
crimson
nuts
and
it
was
the
property
of
the
nuts
that
whoever
ate
of
them
immediately
became
possessed
of
the
knowledge
of
everything
that
was
in
the
world
the
story
is
in
fact
a
gaelic
version
of
the
hebrew
myth
of
tree
of
the
knowledge
of
good
and
one
class
of
creatures
alone
had
this
salmon
who
lived
in
the
well
and
swallowed
the
nuts
as
they
dropped
from
the
trees
into
the
water
and
thus
knew
all
things
and
appear
in
legend
as
the
of
all
others
even
the
highest
gods
were
forbidden
to
approach
the
place
only
boann
with
the
proverbial
curiosity
dared
to
disobey
this
fixed
law
she
came
towards
the
sacred
well
but
as
she
did
so
its
waters
rose
up
at
her
and
drove
her
away
before
them
in
a
mighty
rushing
flood
she
escaped
but
the
waters
never
returned
they
made
the
boyne
and
as
for
the
inhabitants
of
the
well
they
wandered
disconsolately
through
the
depths
of
the
river
looking
in
vain
for
their
lost
nuts
one
of
these
salmon
was
afterwards
eaten
by
the
famous
finn
mac
coul
upon
whom
all
its
omniscience
descended
this
way
of
accounting
for
the
existence
of
a
river
is
a
favourite
one
in
irish
legend
it
is
told
also
of
the
shannon
which
burst
like
the
boyne
from
an
inviolable
well
to
pursue
another
presumptuous
nymph
called
sinann
a
granddaughter
of
the
lêr
the
dagda
had
several
children
the
most
important
of
whom
are
brigit
angus
mider
ogma
and
bodb
the
red
of
these
brigit
will
be
already
familiar
to
english
readers
who
know
nothing
of
celtic
myth
originally
she
was
a
goddess
of
fire
and
the
hearth
as
well
as
of
poetry
which
the
gaels
deemed
an
immaterial
supersensual
form
of
flame
but
the
early
christianizers
of
ireland
adopted
the
pagan
goddess
into
their
roll
of
saintship
and
thus
canonized
she
obtained
immense
popularity
as
saint
bridget
or
bride
angus
was
called
which
means
the
of
the
or
perhaps
the
this
most
charming
of
the
creations
of
the
celtic
mythology
is
represented
as
a
gaelic
eros
an
eternally
youthful
exponent
of
love
and
beauty
like
his
father
he
had
a
harp
but
it
was
of
gold
not
oak
as
the
was
and
so
sweet
was
its
music
that
no
one
could
hear
and
not
follow
it
his
kisses
became
birds
which
hovered
invisibly
over
the
young
men
and
maidens
of
erin
whispering
thoughts
of
love
into
their
ears
he
is
chiefly
connected
with
the
banks
of
the
boyne
where
he
had
a
or
fairy
palace
and
many
stories
are
told
of
his
exploits
and
adventures
mider
also
the
hero
of
legends
would
seem
to
have
been
a
god
of
the
underworld
a
gaelic
pluto
as
such
he
was
connected
with
the
isle
of
name
for
what
was
otherwise
and
still
is
called
the
isle
of
he
had
a
stronghold
in
which
he
kept
three
wonderful
cows
and
a
magic
cauldron
he
was
also
the
owner
of
the
cranes
of
denial
and
which
might
be
described
flippantly
as
personified
they
stood
beside
his
door
and
when
anyone
approached
to
ask
for
hospitality
the
first
one
said
not
come
do
not
come
and
the
second
added
away
get
away
while
the
third
chimed
in
with
past
the
house
go
past
the
house
these
three
birds
were
however
stolen
from
mider
by
aitherne
an
avaricious
poet
to
whom
they
would
seem
to
have
been
more
appropriate
than
to
their
owner
who
does
not
otherwise
appear
as
a
churlish
and
illiberal
deity
on
the
contrary
he
is
represented
as
the
victim
of
others
who
plundered
him
freely
the
god
angus
took
away
his
wife
etain
while
his
cows
his
cauldron
and
his
beautiful
daughter
blathnat
were
carried
off
as
spoil
by
the
heroes
or
who
surrounded
king
conchobar
in
the
golden
age
of
ulster
ogma
who
appears
to
have
been
also
called
cermait
that
is
the
was
the
god
of
literature
and
eloquence
he
married
etan
the
daughter
of
diancecht
the
god
of
medicine
and
had
several
children
who
play
parts
more
or
less
prominent
in
the
mythology
of
the
gaelic
celts
one
of
them
was
called
tuirenn
whose
three
sons
murdered
the
father
of
the
and
were
compelled
as
expiation
to
pay
the
greatest
fine
ever
heard
less
than
the
chief
treasures
of
the
world
another
son
cairpré
became
the
professional
bard
of
the
tuatha
dé
danann
while
three
others
reigned
for
a
short
time
over
the
divine
race
as
patron
of
literature
ogma
was
naturally
credited
with
having
been
the
inventor
of
the
famous
alphabet
this
was
an
indigenous
script
of
ireland
which
spread
afterwards
to
great
britain
inscriptions
in
ogmic
characters
having
been
found
in
scotland
the
isle
of
man
south
wales
devonshire
and
at
silchester
in
hampshire
the
roman
city
of
calleva
attrebatum
it
was
originally
intended
for
inscriptions
upon
upright
or
upon
wands
the
equivalents
for
letters
being
notches
cut
across
or
strokes
made
upon
one
of
the
faces
of
the
angle
the
alphabet
running
as
follows
illustration
when
afterwards
written
in
manuscript
the
strokes
were
placed
over
under
or
through
a
horizontal
line
in
the
manner
above
and
the
vowels
were
represented
by
short
lines
instead
of
notches
as
illustration
a
good
example
of
an
ogmic
inscription
is
given
in
professor
it
comes
from
a
pillar
on
a
small
promontory
near
dunmore
head
in
the
west
of
kerry
and
read
horizontally
reads
illustration
erc
the
son
of
the
son
of
erca
descendant
of
modovinia
the
origin
of
this
alphabet
is
obscure
some
authorities
consider
it
of
great
antiquity
while
others
believe
it
entirely
it
seems
at
any
rate
to
have
been
based
upon
and
consequently
to
presuppose
a
knowledge
of
the
roman
alphabet
ogma
besides
being
the
patron
of
literature
was
the
champion
or
professional
strong
man
of
the
tuatha
dé
danann
his
epithet
is
that
is
the
from
his
radiant
and
shining
countenance
the
last
of
the
more
important
children
is
bodb
the
red
who
plays
a
greater
part
in
later
than
in
earlier
legend
he
succeeded
his
father
as
king
of
the
gods
he
is
chiefly
connected
with
the
south
of
ireland
especially
with
the
galtee
mountains
and
with
lough
dearg
where
he
had
a
famous
or
underground
palace
the
poseidon
of
the
tuatha
dé
danann
pantheon
was
called
lêr
but
we
hear
little
of
him
in
comparison
with
his
famous
son
manannán
the
greatest
and
most
popular
of
his
many
children
manannán
mac
lir
was
the
special
patron
of
sailors
who
invoked
him
as
of
and
of
merchants
who
claimed
him
as
the
first
of
their
guild
his
favourite
haunts
were
the
isle
of
man
to
which
he
gave
his
name
and
the
isle
of
arran
in
the
firth
of
clyde
where
he
had
a
palace
called
of
the
he
had
many
famous
spears
called
and
a
sword
called
which
never
failed
to
slay
as
well
as
two
others
known
as
the
and
the
he
had
a
boat
called
which
propelled
and
guided
itself
wherever
its
owner
wished
and
a
horse
called
which
was
swifter
than
the
spring
wind
and
travelled
equally
fast
on
land
or
over
the
waves
of
the
sea
no
weapon
could
hurt
him
through
his
magic
mail
and
and
on
his
helmet
there
shone
two
magic
jewels
bright
as
the
sun
he
endowed
the
gods
with
the
mantle
which
made
them
invisible
at
will
and
he
fed
them
from
his
pigs
which
like
the
boar
sæhrimnir
in
the
norse
valhalla
renewed
themselves
as
soon
as
they
had
been
eaten
of
these
no
doubt
he
made
his
of
the
banquet
at
which
those
who
ate
never
grew
old
thus
the
people
of
the
goddess
danu
preserved
their
immortal
youth
while
the
ale
of
goibniu
the
bestowed
invulnerability
upon
them
it
is
fitting
that
manannán
himself
should
have
been
blessed
beyond
all
the
other
gods
with
inexhaustible
life
up
to
the
latest
days
of
irish
heroic
literature
his
luminous
figure
shines
prominent
nor
is
it
even
yet
wholly
forgotten
goibniu
the
gaelic
hephaestus
who
made
the
people
of
the
goddess
danu
invulnerable
with
his
magic
drink
was
also
the
forger
of
their
weapons
it
was
he
who
helped
by
luchtainé
the
divine
carpenter
and
credné
the
divine
made
the
armoury
with
which
the
tuatha
dé
danann
conquered
the
fomors
equally
useful
to
them
was
diancecht
the
god
of
medicine
it
was
he
who
once
saved
ireland
and
was
indirectly
the
cause
of
the
name
of
the
river
barrow
the
morrígú
the
fierce
wife
had
borne
a
son
of
such
terrible
aspect
that
the
physician
of
the
gods
foreseeing
danger
counselled
that
he
should
be
destroyed
in
his
infancy
this
was
done
and
diancecht
opened
the
heart
and
found
within
it
three
serpents
capable
when
they
grew
to
full
size
of
depopulating
ireland
he
lost
no
time
in
destroying
these
serpents
also
and
burning
them
into
ashes
to
avoid
the
evil
which
even
their
dead
bodies
might
do
more
than
this
he
flung
the
ashes
into
the
nearest
river
for
he
feared
that
there
might
be
danger
even
in
them
and
indeed
so
venomous
were
they
that
the
river
boiled
up
and
slew
every
living
creature
in
it
and
therefore
has
been
called
boiling
ever
since
diancecht
had
several
children
of
whom
two
followed
their
profession
these
were
miach
and
his
sister
airmid
there
were
also
another
daughter
etan
who
married
cermait
or
ogma
and
three
other
sons
called
cian
cethé
and
cu
cian
married
ethniu
the
daughter
of
balor
the
fomor
and
they
had
a
son
who
was
the
crowning
glory
of
the
gaelic
apollo
the
called
which
means
the
or
the
it
was
not
however
with
the
bow
like
the
apollo
of
the
greeks
but
with
the
that
lugh
performed
his
feats
his
worshippers
sometimes
saw
the
terrible
weapon
in
the
sky
as
a
rainbow
and
the
milky
way
was
called
he
also
had
a
magic
spear
which
unlike
the
he
had
no
need
to
wield
himself
for
it
was
alive
and
thirsted
so
for
blood
that
only
by
steeping
its
head
in
a
of
pounded
poppy
leaves
could
it
be
kept
at
rest
when
battle
was
near
it
was
drawn
out
then
it
roared
and
struggled
against
its
thongs
fire
flashed
from
it
and
once
slipped
from
the
leash
it
tore
through
and
through
the
ranks
of
the
enemy
never
tired
of
slaying
another
of
his
possessions
was
a
magic
hound
which
an
ancient
poem
attributed
to
the
fenian
hero
caoilte
hound
of
mightiest
deeds
which
was
irresistible
in
hardness
of
combat
was
better
than
wealth
ever
known
a
ball
of
fire
every
night
virtues
had
that
beautiful
hound
better
this
property
than
any
other
property
mead
or
wine
would
grow
of
it
should
it
bathe
in
spring
this
marvellous
hound
as
well
as
the
marvellous
spear
and
the
indestructible
pigs
of
manannán
were
obtained
for
lugh
by
the
sons
of
tuirenn
as
part
of
the
he
exacted
from
them
for
the
murder
of
his
father
cian
a
hardly
less
curious
story
is
that
which
tells
how
lugh
got
his
name
of
the
or
the
of
all
these
are
of
course
only
the
greater
deities
of
the
gaelic
pantheon
their
divinities
which
answered
to
such
hellenic
figures
as
demeter
zeus
herê
cronos
athena
eros
hades
hermes
hephaestus
aesculapius
and
apollo
all
of
them
had
many
descendants
some
of
whom
play
prominent
parts
in
the
heroic
cycles
of
the
branch
of
and
of
the
in
addition
to
these
there
must
have
been
a
multitude
of
lesser
gods
who
stood
in
much
the
same
relation
to
the
great
gods
as
the
rank
and
file
of
tribesmen
did
to
their
chiefs
most
of
these
were
probably
local
deities
of
the
various
gods
their
heroes
swore
by
but
it
is
also
possible
that
some
may
have
been
divinities
of
the
aboriginal
race
professor

he
can
still

a

of
such
iberian
gods
by

nêt

ireland
consisted

grew
from

was
fortunate
for

increased
from

to
five
thousand
in

near

the
of

would
seem
to
have
been
a
development
of
the
very
oldest
form
of
the
knew
nothing
of
a
plague
but
merely
represented
the
people
of
partholon
as
having
returned
after
their
sojourn
in
ireland
to
the
other
world
whence
they
is
probably
due
to
the
gradual
euhemerization
of
the
ancient
gods
into
ancient
men
following
the
race
of
partholon
came
the
race
of
nemed
which
carried
on
the
work
and
traditions
of
its
forerunner
during
its
time
ireland
again
enlarged
herself
to
the
extent
of
twelve
new
plains
and
four
more
lakes
like
the
people
of
partholon
the
race
of
nemed
struggled
with
the
fomors
and
defeated
them
in
four
consecutive
battles
then
nemed
died
with
two
thousand
of
his
people
from
an
epidemic
and
the
remnant
left
without
their
leader
were
terribly
oppressed
by
the
fomors
two
fomorian
son
of
dela
and
conann
son
of
built
a
tower
of
glass
upon
tory
island
always
their
chief
stronghold
and
where
stories
of
them
still
linger
and
from
this
they
dictated
a
tax
which
recalls
that
paid

greek
story
to
the
cretan

to

during

to
be
delivered
up
on

goaded
by
this
to
a
last
desperate
effort
the
survivors
of
people
attacked
the
tower
and
took
it
conann
perishing
in
the
struggle
but
their
triumph
was
short
morc
the
other
king
collected
his
forces
and
inflicted
such
a
slaughter
upon
the
people
of
nemed
that
out
of
the
sixteen
thousand
who
had
assembled
for
the
storming
of
the
tower
only
thirty
survived
and
these
returned
whence
they
came
or
two
acts
being
mythologically
speaking
the
same
one
can
not
help
seeing
a
good
deal
of
similarity
between
the
stories
of
these
two
mythical
invasions
of
ireland
especially
noticeable
is
the
account
of
the
epidemic
which
destroyed
all
people
and
nearly
all
of
hence
it
has
been
held
that
the
two
legends
are
duplicates
and
that
there
was
at
first
only
one
which
has
been
adapted
somewhat
differently
by
two
races
the
iberians
and
the
gaels
professor
rhys
considers
the
account
of
nemed
to
have
been
the
original
celtic
one
and
the
partholon
story
the
version
of
it
which
the
native
races
made
to
please
themselves
the
name
with
its
initial
is
entirely
foreign
to
the
genius
of
gaelic
speech
moreover
partholon
himself
is
given
by
the
early
chroniclers
ancestors
whose
decidedly
names
reappear
afterwards
as
the
names
of
fir
bolg
chiefs
nemed
was
later
than
partholon
in
ireland
as
the
gaels
or
were
later
than
the
iberians
or
these
are
found
in
myth
as
the
next
colonizers
of
ireland
varying
traditions
say
that
they
came
from
greece
or
from
was
a
euphemism
for
the
celtic
hades
they
consisted
of
three
tribes
called
the
or
of
the
or
of
and
the
or
of
but
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
the
tribe
was
the
most
important
they
are
usually
called
collectively
after
the
last
curious
stories
are
told
of
their
life
in
greece
and
how
they
came
to
ireland
but
these
are
somewhat
factitious
and
obviously
do
not
belong
to
the
earliest
tradition
in
the
time
of
their
domination
they
had
we
are
told
partitioned
ireland
among
them
the
fir
bolg
held
ulster
the
fir
domnann
divided
into
three
kingdoms
occupied
north
munster
south
munster
and
connaught
while
the
fir
gaillion
owned
leinster
these
five
provinces
met
at
a
hill
then
called
but
afterwards
the
of
it
is
near
rathconrath
in
the
county
of
west
meath
and
was
believed
in
early
times
to
mark
the
exact
centre
of
ireland
they
held
the
country
from
the
departure
of
the
people
of
nemed
to
the
coming
of
the
people
of
the
goddess
danu
and
during
this
period
they
had
nine
supreme
kings
at
the
time
of
the
arrival
of
the
gods
their
name
was
eochaid
son
of
erc
surnamed
we
have
practically
no
other
details
regarding
their
life
in
ireland
it
is
obvious
however
that
they
were
not
really
gods
but
the
race
which
the
gaels
when
they
landed
in
ireland
found
already
in
occupation
there
are
many
instances
of
peoples
at
a
certain
stage
of
culture
regarding
tribes
in
a
somewhat
lower
one
as
or
rather
the
suspicion
and
fear
with
which
the
early
celts
must
have
regarded
the
savage
aborigines
made
them
seem
than
they
feared
them
for
the
weird
magical
rites
which
they
practised
in
their
inaccessible
forts
among
the
hills
amid
storms
and
mountain
mists
the
gaels
who
held
themselves
to
be
the
children
of
light
deemed
these
children
of
the
dark
their
tribal
names
seem
to
have
been
in
several
instances
founded
upon
this
idea
there
were
the
of
and
the
of
the
the
territory
of
the
western
tribe
of
the
of
was
called
the
the
celts
who
held
their
own
gods
to
have
preceded
them
into
ireland
would
not
believe
that
even
the
tuatha
dé
danann
could
have
wrested
the
land
from
these
iberians
without
battle
they
seem
also
to
have
been
considered
as
in
some
way
connected
with
the
fomors
just
as
the
largest
iberian
tribe
was
called
the
of
so
the
fomors
were
called
the
of
and
indech
one
of
their
kings
is
a
of
thus
eternal
battle
between
the
gods
children
of
danu
and
the
giants
children
of
domnu
would
reflect
in
the
supernatural
world
the
perpetual
warfare
between
invading
celt
and
resisting
iberian
it
is
shadowed
too
in
the
later
heroic
cycle
the
champions
of
ulster
aryans
and
gaels
have
no
such
bitter
enemies
as
the
fir
domnann
of
munster
and
the
fir
gaillion
of
leinster
a
few
scholars
would
even
see
in
the
later
between
the
high
king
of
ireland
and
his
rebellious
fenians
the
last
historic
or
mythological
adumbration
of
racial
war
the
enemies
alike
of
fir
bolg
and
fomor
the
tuatha
dé
danann
gods
of
the
gaels
were
the
next
to
arrive
what
is
probably
the
earliest
account
tells
us
that
they
came
from
the
sky
later
versions
however
give
them
a
habitation
upon
say
in
the
north
others
in
the
isles
of
the
they
had
dwelt
in
four
mythical
cities
called
findias
gorias
murias
and
falias
where
they
had
learned
poetry
and
the
primitive
mind

not
very
dissimilar
whence
they
had
brought
to
ireland
their
four
chief
treasures
from
findias
came

from
whose
stroke
no
one
ever
escaped
or
recovered
from
gorias
terrible
lance
from
murias
the
cauldron
and
from
falias
the
stone
of
fál
better
known
as
the
of
which
afterwards
fell
into
the
hands
of
the
early
kings
of
ireland
according
to
legend
it
had
the
magic
property
of
uttering
a
human
cry
when
touched
by
the
rightful
king
of
erin
some
have
recognized
in
this
marvellous
stone
the
same
rude
block
which
edward
i
brought
from
scone
in
the
year
and
placed
in
westminster
abbey
where
it
now
forms
part
of
the
coronation
chair
it
is
a
curious
fact
that
while
scottish
legend
asserts
this
stone
to
have
come
to
scotland
from
ireland
irish
legend
should
also
declare
that
it
was
taken
from
ireland
to
scotland
this
would
sound
like
conclusive
evidence
but
it
is
none
the
less
held
by
leading
modern
skene
who
has
published
a
monograph
on
the
subject
the
stone
of
scone
and
the
stone
of
tara
were
never
the
same
petrie
identifies
the
real
with
a
stone
which
has
always
remained
in
ireland
and
which
was
removed
from
its
original
position
on
tara
hill
in
to
mark
the
tomb
of
the
rebels
buried
close
by
under
a
mound
now
known
as
whether
the
tuatha
dé
danann
came
from
earth
or
heaven
they
landed
in
a
dense
cloud
upon
the
coast
of
ireland
on
the
mystic
first
of
may
without
having
been
opposed
or
even
noticed
by
the
people
whom
it
will
be
convenient
to
follow
the
manuscript
authorities
in
calling
the
that
those
might
still
be
ignorant
of
their
coming
the
morrígú
helped
by
badb
and
macha
made
use
of
the
magic
they
had
learned
in
findias
gorias
murias
and
falias
they
spread
showers
and
over
the
country
and
caused
the
air
to
pour
down
fire
and
blood
upon
the
fir
bolgs
so
that
they
were
obliged
to
shelter
themselves
for
three
days
and
three
nights
but
the
fir
bolgs
had
druids
of
their
own
and
in
the
end
they
put
a
stop
to
these
enchantments
by
and
the
air
grew
clear
again
the
tuatha
dé
danann
advancing
westward
had
reached
a
place
called
the
of
the
in
leinster
when
the
two
armies
met
each
sent
out
a
warrior
to
parley
the
two
adversaries
approached
each
other
cautiously
their
eyes
peeping
over
the
tops
of
their
shields
then
coming
gradually
nearer
they
spoke
to
one
another
and
the
desire
to
examine
each
weapons
made
them
almost
friends
the
envoy
of
the
fir
bolgs
looked
with
wonder
at
the
thin
slender
long
of
the
warrior
of
the
tuatha
dé
danann
while
the
ambassador
of
the
tribe
of
the
goddess
danu
was
not
less
impressed
by
the
lances
of
the
fir
bolgs
which
were
thick
pointless
but
they
agreed
to
exchange
weapons
so
that
each
side
might
by
an
examination
of
them
be
able
to
come
to
some
opinion
as
to
its
strength
before
parting
the
envoy
of
the
tuatha
dé
danann
offered
the
fir
bolgs
through
their
representative
peace
with
a
division
of
the
country
into
two
equal
halves
the
fir
bolg
envoy
advised
his
people
to
accept
this
offer
but
their
king
eochaid
son
of
erc
would
not
we
once
give
these
people
half
he
said
will
soon
have
the
the
people
of
the
goddess
danu
were
on
the
other
hand
very
much
impressed
by
the
sight
of
the
fir
weapons
they
decided
to
secure
a
more
advantageous
position
and
retreating
farther
west
into
connaught
to
a
plain
then
called
nia
but
now
moytura
near
the
present
village
of
cong
they
drew
up
their
line
at
its
extreme
end
in
front
of
the
pass
of
balgatan
which
offered
a
retreat
in
case
of
defeat
the
fir
bolgs
followed
them
and
encamped
on
the
nearer
side
of
the
plain
then
nuada
king
of
the
tuatha
dé
danann
sent
an
ambassador
offering
the
same
terms
as
before
again
the
fir
bolgs
declined
them
asked
the
envoy
you
intend
to
give
battle
must
have
a
truce
they
said
we
want
time
to
repair
our
armour
burnish
our
helmets
and
sharpen
our
swords
besides
we
must
have
spears
like
yours
made
for
us
and
you
must
have
spears
like
ours
made
for
the
result
of
this
chivalrous
but
to
modern
ideas
amazing
parley
was
that
a
truce
of
one
hundred
and
five
days
was
agreed
upon
it
was
on
midsummer
day
that
the
opposing
armies
at
last
met
the
people
of
the
goddess
danu
appeared
in
flaming
wielding
their
speckled
and
firm
opposite
to
them
were
ranged
the
fir
bolgs
brilliant
and
flaming
with
their
swords
spears
blades
and
the
proceedings
began
with
a
kind
of
deadly
in
which
thrice
nine
of
the
tuatha
dé
danann
played
the
same
number
of
the
fir
bolgs
and
were
defeated
and
killed
then
followed
another
parley
to
decide
how
the
battle
should
be
carried
on
whether
there
should
be
fighting
every
day
or
only
on
every
second
day
moreover
nuada
obtained
from
eochaid
an
assurance
that
the
battles
should
always
be
fought
with
equal
numbers
although
this
was
we
are
told
disagreeable
to
the
fir
bolg
king
because
he
had
largely
the
advantage
in
the
numbers
of
his
then
warfare
recommenced
with
a
series
of
single
combats
like
those
of
the
greeks
and
trojans
in
the
at
the
end
of
each
day
the
conquerors
on
both
sides
went
back
to
their
camps
and
were
refreshed
by
being
bathed
in
healing
baths
of
medicinal
herbs
so
the
fight
went
on
for
four
days
with
terrible
slaughter
upon
each
side
a
fir
bolg
champion
called
sreng
fought
in
single
combat
with
nuada
the
king
of
the
gods
and
shore
off
his
hand
and
half
his
shield
with
one
terrific
blow
eochaid
the
king
of
the
fir
bolgs
was
even
less
fortunate
than
nuada
for
he
lost
his
life
suffering
terribly
from
thirst
he
went
with
a
hundred
of
his
men
to
look
for
water
and
was
followed
and
pursued
as
far
as
the
strand
of
ballysadare
in
sligo
here
he
turned
to
bay
but
was
killed
his
grave
being
still
marked
by
a
tumulus
the
fir
bolgs
reduced
at
last
to
three
hundred
men
demanded
single
combat
until
all
upon
one
side
were
slain
but
sooner
than
consent
to
this
the
tuatha
dé
danann
offered
them
a
fifth
part
of
ireland
whichever
province
they
might
choose
they
agreed
and
chose
connaught
ever
afterwards
their
especial
home
and
where
until
the
middle
of
the
seventeenth
century
men
were
still
found
tracing
their
descent
from
sreng
the
whole
story
has
a
singularly
historical
curiously
unmythological
air
about
it
which
contrasts
strangely
with
the
account
of
the
other
battle
of
the
same
name
which
the
tuatha
dé
danann
waged
afterwards
with
the
fomors
the
neighbourhood
of
cong
still
preserves
both
relics
and
traditions
of
the
fight
upon
the
plain
of
as
it
is
called
to
distinguish
it
from
the
of
the
second
battle
are
many
circles
and
tumuli
these
circles
are
especially
numerous
near
the
village
itself
and
it
is
said
that
there
were
formerly
others
which
have
been
used
for
making
walls
and
dykes
large
cairns
of
stones
too
are
scattered
over
what
was
certainly
once
the
scene
of
a
great
battle
these
various
prehistoric
monuments
each
have
their
story
and
sir
william
wilde
as
he
relates
in
his
was
so
impressed
by
the
unexpected
agreement
between
the
details
of
the
legendary
battle
as
he
read
them
in
the
ancient
manuscript
and
the
traditions
still
attaching
to
the
mounds
circles
and
cairns
that
he
tells
us
he
could
not
help
coming
to
the
conclusion
that
the
account
was
absolutely
historical
certainly
the
coincidences
are
curious
his
opinion
was
that
the
were
a
colony
of
belgæ
and
that
the
dé
were
danes
but
the
people
of
the
goddess
danu
are
too
obviously
mythical
to
make
it
worth
while
to
seek
any
for
them
in
the
world
of

clear
that
the

are
divine

it
is
that
the

the

their
native

they
appear
in
ancient
mediæval
and
almost
modern
chronicles
as
the
old
race
of

land
the
truth
seems
to
be
that
the
whole
story
of
the
war
between
the
gods
and
the
fir
bolgs
is
an
invention
of
comparatively
late
times
in

earliest
documents
there
is
only
one
battle
of
moytura
fought
between
the
people
of
the
goddess
danu
and
the
fomors
the
idea
of
doubling
it
seems
to
date
from
after
the
eleventh
century
and
its
inventor
may
very
well
have
used
the
legends
concerning
this
where
two
unknown
armies
had
fought
in
days
gone
by

story
it
never

the
rise
of
the
it
was
as
a
result
of
the
loss
of
his
hand
in
this
battle
with
the
fir
bolgs
that
nuada
got
his
name
of
that
is
the
for
diancecht
the
physician
of
the
tuatha
dé
danann
made
him
an
artificial
hand
of
silver
so
skilfully
that
it
moved
in
all
its
joints
and
was
as
strong
and
supple
as
a
real
one
but
good
as
it
was
of
its
sort
it
was
a
blemish
and
according
to
celtic
custom
no
maimed
person
could
sit
upon
the
throne
nuada
was
deposed
and
the
tuatha
dé
danann
went
into
council
to
appoint
a
new
king
they
agreed
that
it
would
be
a
politic
thing
for
them
to
conciliate
the
fomors
the
giants
of
the
sea
and
make
an
alliance
with
them
so
they
sent
a
message
to
bress
the
son
of
the
fomorian
king
elathan
asking
him
to
come
and
rule
over
them
bress
accepted
this
offer
and
they
made
a
marriage
between
him
and
brigit
the
daughter
of
the
dagda
at
the
same
time
cian
the
son
of
diancecht
the
physician
of
the
tuatha
dé
danann
married
ethniu
the
daughter
of
the
fomor
balor
then
bress
was
made
king
and
endowed
with
lands
and
a
palace
and
he
on
his
part
gave
hostages
that
he
would
abdicate
if
his
rule
ever
became
unpleasing
to
those
who
had
elected
him
but
in
spite
of
all
his
fair
promises
bress
who
belonged
in
heart
to
his
own
fierce
people
began
to
oppress
his
subjects
with
excessive
taxes
he
put
a
tax
upon
every
hearth
upon
every
and
upon
every
quern
as
well
as
a
of
an
ounce
of
gold
upon
every
member
of
the
tuatha
dé
danann
by
a
crafty
trick
too
he
obtained
the
milk
of
all
their
cattle
he
asked
at
first
only
for
the
produce
of
any
cows
which
happened
to
be
brown
and
hairless
and
the
people
of
the
goddess
danu
granted
him
this
cheerfully
but
bress
passed
all
the
cattle
in
ireland
between
two
fires
so
that
their
hair
was
singed
off
and
thus
obtained
the
monopoly
of
the
main
source
of
food
to
earn
a
livelihood
all
the
gods
even
the
greatest
were
now
forced
to
labour
for
him
ogma
their
champion
was
sent
out
to
collect
firewood
while
the
dagda
was
put
to
work
building
forts
and
castles
one
day
when
the
dagda
was
at
his
task
his
son
angus
came
to
him
have
nearly
finished
that
castle
he
said
reward
do
you
intend
to
ask
from
bress
when
it
is
done
the
dagda
replied
that
he
had
not
yet
thought
of
it
me
give
you
some
advice
said
angus
bress
to
have
all
the
cattle
in
ireland
gathered
together
upon
a
plain
so
that
you
can
pick
out
one
for
yourself
he
will
consent
to
that
then
choose
the
heifer
called
the
dagda
finished
building
the
fort
and
then
went
to
bress
for
his
reward
will
you
have
asked
bress
want
all
the
cattle
in
ireland
gathered
together
upon
a
plain
so
that
i
may
choose
one
of
them
for
bress
did
this
and
the
dagda
took
the
heifer
angus
had
told
him
of
the
king
who
had
expected
to
be
asked
very
much
more
laughed
at
what
he
thought
was
the
simplicity
but
angus
had
been
wise
as
will
be
seen
hereafter
meanwhile
bress
was
infuriating
the
people
of
the
goddess
danu
by
adding
avarice
to
tyranny
it
was
for
kings
to
be
liberal
to
but
at
the
court
of
bress
no
one
ever
greased
his
knife
with
fat
or
made
his
breath
smell
of
ale
nor
were
there
ever
any
poets
or
musicians
or
jugglers
or
jesters
there
to
give
pleasure
to
the
people
for
bress
would
distribute
no
largess
next
he
cut
down
the
very
subsistence
of
the
gods
so
scanty
was
his
allowance
of
food
that
they
began
to
grow
weak
with
famine
ogma
through
feebleness
could
only
carry
of
the
wood
needed
for
fuel
so
that
they
suffered
from
cold
as
well
as
from
hunger
it
was
at
this
crisis
that
two
physicians
miach
the
son
and
airmid
the
daughter
of
diancecht
the
god
of
medicine
came
to
the
castle
where
the
dispossessed
king
nuada
lived
porter
blemished
like
himself
for
he
had
lost
an
eye
was
sitting
at
the
gate
and
on
his
lap
was
a
cat
curled
up
asleep
the
porter
asked
the
strangers
who
they
were
are
good
doctors
they
said
that
is
so
he
replied
you
can
give
me
a
new
they
said
could
take
one
of
the
eyes
of
that
cat
and
put
it
in
the
place
where
your
lost
eye
used
to
should
be
very
pleased
if
you
would
do
that
answered
the
porter
so
miach
and
airmid
removed
one
of
the
eyes
and
put
it
in
the
hollow
where
the
eye
had
been
the
story
goes
on
to
say
that
this
was
not
wholly
a
benefit
to
him
for
the
eye
retained
its
nature
and
when
the
man
wished
to
sleep
at
nights
the
eye
was
always
looking
out
for
mice
while
it
could
hardly
be
kept
awake
during
the
day
nevertheless
he
was
pleased
at
the
time
and
went
and
told
nuada
who
commanded
that
the
doctors
who
had
performed
this
marvellous
cure
should
be
brought
to
him
as
they
came
in
they
heard
the
king
groaning
for
wrist
had
festered
where
the
silver
hand
joined
the
arm
of
flesh
miach
asked
where
own
hand
was
and
they
told
him
that
it
had
been
buried
long
ago
but
he
dug
it
up
and
placed
it
to
stump
he
uttered
an
incantation
over
it
saying
to
sinew
and
nerve
to
nerve
be
joined
and
in
three
days
and
nights
the
hand
had
renewed
itself
and
fixed
itself
to
the
arm
so
that
nuada
was
whole
again
when
diancecht
father
heard
of
this
he
was
very
angry
to
think
that
his
son
should
have
excelled
him
in
the
art
of
medicine
he
sent
for
him
and
struck
him
upon
the
head
with
a
sword
cutting
the
skin
but
not
wounding
the
flesh
miach
easily
healed
this
so
diancecht
hit
him
again
this
time
to
the
bone
again
miach
cured
himself
the
third
time
his
father
smote
him
the
sword
went
right
through
the
skull
to
the
membrane
of
the
brain
but
even
this
wound
miach
was
able
to
leech
at
the
fourth
stroke
however
diancecht
cut
the
brain
in
two
and
miach
could
do
nothing
for
that
he
died
and
diancecht
buried
him
and
upon
his
grave
there
grew
up
three
hundred
and
stalks
of
grass
each
one
a
cure
for
any
illness
of
each
of
the
three
hundred
and
nerves
in
a
body
airmid
sister
plucked
all
these
very
carefully
and
arranged
them
on
her
mantle
according
to
their
properties
but
her
angry
and
jealous
father
overturned
the
cloak
and
hopelessly
confused
them
if
it
had
not
been
for
that
act
says
the
early
writer
men
would
know
how
to
cure
every
illness
and
would
so
be
immortal
the
healing
of
blemish
happened
just
at
the
time
when
all
the
people
of
the
goddess
danu
had
at
last
agreed
that
the
exactions
and
tyranny
of
bress
could
no
longer
be
borne
it
was
the
insult
he
put
upon
cairpré
son
of
ogma
the
god
of
literature
that
caused
things
to
come
to
this
head
poets
were
always
held
by
the
celts
in
great
honour
and
when
cairpré
the
bard
of
the
tuatha
dé
danann
went
to
visit
bress
he
expected
to
be
treated
with
much
consideration
and
fed
at
the
own
table
but
instead
of
doing
so
bress
lodged
him
in
a
small
dark
room
where
there
was
no
fire
no
bed
and
no
furniture
except
a
mean
table
on
which
small
cakes
of
dry
bread
were
put
on
a
little
dish
for
his
food
the
next
morning
cairpré
rose
early
and
left
the
palace
without
having
spoken
to
bress
it
was
the
custom
of
poets
when
they
left
a
court
to
utter
a
panegyric
on
their
host
but
cairpré
treated
bress
instead
to
a
magical
satire
it
was
the
first
satire
ever
made
in
ireland
and
seems
to
us
to
bear
upon
it
all
the
marks
of
an
early
effort
roughly
rendered
it
said
meat
on
the
plates
no
milk
of
the
cows
no
shelter
for
the
belated
no
money
for
the
minstrels
may
cheer
be
what
he
gives
to
others
this
satire
of
was
we
are
assured
so
virulent
that
it
caused
great
red
blotches
to
break
out
all
over
face
this
in
itself
constituted
a
blemish
such
as
should
not
be
upon
a
king
and
the
tuatha
dé
danann
called
upon
bress
to
abdicate
and
let
nuada
take
the
throne
again
bress
was
obliged
to
do
so
he
went
back
to
the
country
of
the
fomors
underneath
the
sea
and
complained
to
his
father
elathan
its
king
asking
him
to
gather
an
army
to
reconquer
his
throne
the
fomors
assembled
in
tethra
balor
indech
and
all
the
other
warriors
and
they
decided
to
come
with
a
great
host
and
take
ireland
away
and
put
it
under
the
sea
where
the
people
of
the
goddess
danu
would
never
be
able
to
find
it
again
at
the
same
time
another
assembly
was
also
being
held
at
tara
the
capital
of
the
tuatha
dé
danann
nuada
was
celebrating
his
return
to
the
throne
by
a
feast
to
his
people
while
it
was
at
its
height
a
stranger
clothed
like
a
king
came
to
the
palace
gate
the
porter
asked
him
his
name
and
errand
am
called

said

all
these
crafts
at
once
for
if
he
has

no
need
for
me
to

to
so
the
went
inside
and
told
the
king
that
a
man
had
come
who
called
himself
lugh
the
or
the
of
all
and
that
he
claimed
to
know
everything
the
king
sent
out
his
best
to
play
against
the
stranger
lugh
won
inventing
a
new
move
called
then
nuada
invited
him
in
lugh
entered
and
sat
down
upon
the
chair
called
the
kept
for
the
wisest
man
ogma
the
champion
was
showing
off
his
strength
upon
the
floor
was
a
flagstone
so
large
that
fourscore
yokes
of
oxen
would
have
been
needed
to
move
it
ogma
pushed
it
before
him
along
the
hall
and
out
at
the
door
then
lugh
rose
from
his
chair
and
pushed
it
back
again
but
this
stone
huge
as
it
was
was
only
a
portion
broken
from
a
still
greater
rock
outside
the
palace
lugh
picked
it
up
and
put
it
back
into
its
place
the
tuatha
dé
danann
asked
him
to
play
the
harp
to
them
so
he
played
the
and
the
king
and
all
his
court
fell
asleep
and
did
not
wake
until
the
same
hour
of
the
following
day
next
he
played
a
plaintive
air
and
they
all
wept
lastly
he
played
a
measure
which
sent
them
into
transports
of
joy
when
nuada
had
seen
all
these
numerous
talents
of
lugh
he
began
to
wonder
whether
one
so
gifted
would
not
be
of
great
help
against
the
fomors
he
took
counsel
with
the
others
and
by
their
advice
lent
his
throne
to
lugh
for
thirteen
days
taking
the
at
his
side
lugh
summoned
all
the
tuatha

to

the
gaelic

the
preparations
for
this
war
are
said
to
have
lasted
seven
years
it
was
during
the
interval
that
there
befel
an
episode
which
might
almost
be
called
the
of
the
gaelic
mythology
in
spite
of
the
dethronement
of
bress
the
fomors
still
claimed
their
annual
tribute
from
the
tribe
of
the
goddess
danu
and
sent
their
nine
times
nine
in
number
to
to
collect
it
but
while
they
waited
for
the
gods
to
come
to
tender
their
submission
and
their
subsidy
they
saw
a
young
man
approaching
them
he
was
riding
upon
the
horse
of
manannán
son
of
lêr
and
was
dressed
in
breastplate
and
helmet
through
which
no
weapon
could
wound
their
wearer
and
he
was
armed
with
sword
and
shield
and
poisoned
darts
to
the
setting
says
the
story
the
splendour
of
his
countenance
and
his
forehead
and
they
were
not
able
to
look
in
his
face
for
the
greatness
of
his
and
no
wonder
for
he
was
lugh
the
the
of
the
gaels
he
fell
upon
the
fomorian
killing
all
but
nine
of
them
and
these
he
only
spared
that
they
might
go
back
to
their
kinsmen
and
tell
how
the
gods
had
received
them
there
was
consternation
in
the
country
can
this
terrible
warrior
be
asked
balor
know
said
wife
must
be
the
son
of
our
daughter
ethniu
and
i
foretell
that
since
he
has
cast
in
his
lot
with
his
people
we
shall
never
bear
rule
in
erin
the
chiefs
of
the
fomors
saw
that
this
slaughter
of
their
signified
that
the
tuatha
dé
danann
meant
fighting
they
held
a
council
to
debate
on
it
there
came
to
it
elathan
and
tethra
and
indech
kings
of
the
fomors
bress
himself
and
balor
of
the

cethlenn
the

wife
twelve

and
all
the
chief
fomorian
warriors
and
druids
meanwhile
upon
earth
lugh
was
sending
messengers
all
over
erin
to
assemble
the
tuatha
dé
danann
upon
this
errand
went
father
cian
who
seems
to
have
been
a
kind
of
lesser
solar
deity
son
of
diancecht
the
god
of
medicine
as
cian
was
going
over
the
plain
of
muirthemne
he
saw
three
armed
warriors
approaching
him
and
when
they
got
nearer
he
recognized
them
as
the
three
sons
of
tuirenn
son
of
ogma
whose
names
were
brian
iuchar
and
iucharba
between
these
three
and
cian
with
his
brothers
cethé
and
cu
there
was
for
some
reason
a
private
enmity
cian
saw
that
he
was
now
at
a
disadvantage
my
brothers
were
with
me
he
said
to
himself
a
fight
we
would
make
but
as
i
am
alone
it
will
be
best
for
me
to
conceal
looking
round
he
saw
a
herd
of
pigs
feeding
on
the
plain
like
all
the
gods
he
had
the
faculty
of
so
striking
himself
with
a
magic
wand
he
changed
himself
into
a
pig
joined
the
herd
and
began
feeding
with
them
but
he
had
been
seen
by
the
sons
of
tuirenn
has
become
of
the
warrior
who
was
walking
on
the
plain
a
moment
ago
said
brian
to
his
brothers
saw
him
then
they
replied
we
do
not
know
where
he
is
you
have
not
used
the
proper
vigilance
which
is
needed
in
time
of
war
said
the
elder
brother
i
know
what
has
become
of
him
he
has
struck
himself
with
a
druidical
wand
and
changed
himself
into
a
pig
and
there
he
is
in
that
herd
rooting
up
the
ground
just
like
all
the
other
pigs
i
can
also
tell
you
who
he
is
his
name
is
cian
and
you
know
that
he
is
no
friend
of
is
a
pity
that
he
has
taken
refuge
among
the
pigs
they
replied
they
belong
to
some
one
of
the
tuatha
dé
danann
and
even
if
we
were
to
kill
them
all
cian
might
still
escape
again
brian
reproached
his
brothers
are
very
ignorant
he
said
you
can
not
distinguish
a
magical
beast
from
a
natural
beast
however
i
will
show
and
thereupon
he
struck
his
two
brothers
with
his
own
wand
of
and
turned
them
into
two
swift
slender
hounds
and
set
them
upon
the
pigs
the
magic
hounds
soon
found
the
magic
pig
and
drove
it
out
of
the
herd
on
to
the
open
plain
then
brian
threw
his
spear
and
hit
it
the
wounded
pig
came
to
a
stop
was
an
evil
deed
of
yours
casting
that
spear
it
cried
in
a
human
voice
i
am
not
a
pig
but
cian
son
of
diancecht
so
give
me
iuchar
and
iucharba
would
have
granted
it
and
let
him
go
but
their
fiercer
brother
swore
that
cian
should
be
put
an
end
to
even
if
he
came
back
to
life
seven
times
so
cian
tried
a
fresh
ruse
me
he
asked
to
return
to
my
own
shape
before
you
slay
replied
brian
i
would
much
rather
kill
a
man
than
a
so
cian
spoke
the
befitting
spell
cast
off
his
disguise
and
stood
before
them
in
his
own
shape
will
be
obliged
to
spare
my
life
now
he
said
will
not
replied
brian
it
will
be
the
worst
work
for
all
of
you
that
you
ever
did
in
your
lives
he
answered
if
you
had
killed
me
in
the
shape
of
a
pig
you
would
only
have
had
to
pay
the
value
of
a
pig
but
if
you
kill
me
now
i
tell
you
that
there
never
has
been
and
there
never
will
be
anyone
killed
in
this
world
for
whose
death
a
greater
will
be
exacted
than
for
but
the
sons
of
tuirenn
would
not
listen
to
him
they
slew
him
and
pounded
his
body
with
stones
until
it
was
a
crushed
mass
six
times
they
tried
to
bury
him
and
the
earth
cast
him
back
in
horror
but
the
seventh
time
the
mould
held
him
and
they
put
stones
upon
him
to
keep
him
down
they
left
him
buried
there
and
went
to
tara
meanwhile
lugh
had
been
expecting
his
return
as
he
did
not
come
he
determined
to
go
and
look
for
him
he
traced
him
to
the
plain
of
muirthemne
and
there
he
was
at
fault
but
the
indignant
earth
itself
which
had
witnessed
the
murder
spoke
to
lugh
and
told
him
everything
so
lugh
dug
up
his
corpse
and
made
certain
how
he
had
come
to
his
death
then
he
mourned
over
him
and
laid
him
back
in
the
earth
and
heaped
a
barrow
over
him
and
set
up
a
pillar
with
his
name
on
it
in
he
went
back
to
tara
and
entered
the
great
hall
it
was
filled
with
the
people
of
the
goddess
danu
and
among
them
lugh
saw
the
three
sons
of
tuirenn
so
he
shook
the
with
which
the
gaels
used
to
ask
for
a
hearing
in
an
assembly
and
when
all
were
silent
he
said
of
the
goddess
danu
i
ask
you
a
question
what
would
be
the
vengeance
that
any
of
you
would
take
upon
one
who
had
murdered
his
father
a
great
astonishment
fell
upon
them
and
nuada
their
king
said
it
is
not
your
father
that
has
been
murdered
is
replied
lugh
i
am
looking
at
those
who
murdered
him
and
they
know
how
they
did
it
better
than
i
then
nuada
declared
that
nothing
short
of
hewing
the
murderer
of
his
father
limb
from
limb
would
satisfy
him
and
all
the
others
said
the
same
including
the
sons
of
tuirenn
very
ones
who
did
the
deed
say
that
cried
lugh
let
them
not
leave
the
hall
till
they
have
settled
with
me
about
the
to
be
paid
for
it
was
i
who
had
killed
your
father
said
the
king
should
think
myself
lucky
if
you
were
willing
to
accept
a
fine
instead
of
the
sons
of
tuirenn
took
counsel
together
in
whispers
iuchar
and
iucharba
were
in
favour
of
admitting
their
guilt
but
brian
was
afraid
that
if
they
confessed
lugh
would
withdraw
his
offer
to
accept
a
fine
and
would
demand
their
deaths
so
he
stood
out
and
said
that
though
it
was
not
they
who
had
killed
cian
yet
sooner
than
remain
under
anger
as
he
suspected
them
they
would
pay
the
same
fine
as
if
they
had
you
shall
pay
the
fine
said
lugh
i
will
tell
you
what
it
shall
be
it
is
this
three
apples
and
a
and
a
spear
and
two
horses
and
a
chariot
and
seven
pigs
and
a
and
a
and
three
shouts
on
a
hill
that
is
the
fine
and
if
you
think
it
is
too
much
i
will
remit
some
of
it
but
if
you
do
not
think
it
is
too
much
then
pay
it
were
a
hundred
times
that
replied
brian
should
not
think
it
too
much
indeed
it
seems
so
little
that
i
fear
there
must
be
some
treachery
concealed
in
do
not
think
it
too
little
replied
lugh
me
your
pledge
before
the
people
of
the
goddess
danu
that
you
will
pay
it
faithfully
and
i
will
give
you
mine
that
i
will
ask
no
so
the
sons
of
tuirenn
bound
themselves
before
the
tuatha
dé
danann
to
pay
the
fine
to
lugh
when
they
had
sworn
and
given
sureties
lugh
turned
to
them
again
will
he
said
to
you
the
nature
of
the
fine
you
have
pledged
yourselves
to
pay
me
so
that
you
may
know
whether
it
is
too
little
or
and
with
foreboding
hearts
the
sons
of
tuirenn
set
themselves
to
listen
three
apples
that
i
have
demanded
he
began
three
apples
from
the
garden
of
the
hesperides
in
the
east
of
the
world
you
will
know
them
by
three
signs
they
are
the
size
of
the
head
of
a
child
they
are
of
the
colour
of
burnished
gold
and
they
taste
of
honey
wounds
are
healed
and
diseases
cured
by
eating
them
and
they
do
not
diminish
in
any
way
by
being
eaten
whoever
casts
one
of
them
hits
anything
he
wishes
and
then
it
comes
back
into
his
hand
i
will
accept
no
other
apples
instead
of
these
their
owners
keep
them
perpetually
guarded
because
of
a
prophecy
that
three
young
warriors
from
the
west
of
the
world
will
come
to
take
them
by
force
and
brave
as
you
may
be
i
do
not
think
that
you
will
ever
get
them
that
i
have
demanded
is
the
of
tuis
king
of
greece
it
has
two
virtues
its
touch
perfectly
cures
all
wounded
or
sick
persons
if
only
there
is
any
life
still
left
in
them
and
every
stream
of
water
through
which
it
passes
is
turned
into
wine
for
nine
days
i
do
not
think
that
you
will
get
it
from
the
king
of
greece
either
with
his
consent
or
without
it
can
you
guess
what
spear
it
is
that
i
have
demanded
asked
lugh
can
not
they
said
is
the
poisoned
spear
of
pisear
king
of
persia
it
is
irresistible
in
battle
it
is
so
fiery
that
its
blade
must
always
be
held
under
water
lest
it
destroy
the
city
in
which
it
is
kept
you
will
find
it
very
difficult
to
obtain
the
two
horses
and
the
chariot
are
the
two
wonderful
horses
of
dobhar
king
of
sicily
which
run
equally
well
over
land
and
sea
there
are
no
other
horses
in
the
world
like
them
and
no
other
vehicle
equal
to
the
chariot
the
seven
pigs
are
the
pigs
of
easal
king
of
the
golden
pillars
though
they
may
be
killed
every
night
they
are
found
alive
again
the
next
day
and
every
person
that
eats
part
of
them
can
never
be
afflicted
with
any
disease
the
i
claim
is
the
of
the
king
of
ioruaidhe
her
name
is
failinis
every
wild
beast
she
sees
she
catches
at
once
it
will
not
be
easy
for
you
to
secure
her
which
you
must
get
for
me
is
one
of
the
of
the
women
of
the
island
of
fianchuivé
which
is
at
the
bottom
of
the
sea
between
erin
and
alba
have
also
pledged
yourselves
to
give
three
shouts
upon
a
hill
the
hill
upon
which
they
must
be
given
is
the
hill
called
cnoc
miodhchaoin
in
the
north
of
lochlann
miodhchaoin
and
his
sons
do
not
allow
shouts
to
be
given
on
that
hill
besides
this
it
was
they
who
gave
my
father
his
military
education
and
even
if
i
were
to
forgive
you
they
would
not
so
that
though
you
achieve
all
the
other
adventures
i
think
that
you
will
fail
in
this
one
you
know
what
sort
of
a
fine
it
is
that
you
have
bargained
to
pay
me
said
lugh
and
fear
and
astonishment
fell
upon
the
sons
of
tuirenn
this
tale
is
evidently
the
work
of
some
ancient
irish
who
wished
to
compile
from
various
sources
a
more
or
less
complete
account
of
how
the
gaelic
gods
obtained
their
legendary
possessions
the
spear
of
pisear
king
of
persia
is
obviously
the
same
weapon
as
the
lance
of
lugh
which
another
tradition
describes
as
having
been
brought
by
the
tuatha
dé
danann
from
their
original
home
in
the
city
of

the
whelp
of
the
king
of
ioruaidhe
is
of
mightiest
which
was
irresistible
in
battle
and
which
turned
any
running
water
it
bathed
in
into
wine
a
property
here
transferred
to
the
magic
of
king
tuis
the
seven
swine
of
the
king
of
the
golden
pillars
must
be
the
same
undying
porkers
from
whose
flesh
manannán
mac
lir
made
the
of
which
preserved
the
eternal
youth
of
the
gods
it
was
with
horses
and
chariot
that
ran
along
the
surface
of
the
sea
that
manannán
used
to
journey
to
and
fro
between
erin
and
the
celtic
elysium
in
the
west
the
apples
that
grew
in
the
garden
of
the
hesperides
were
surely
of
the
same
celestial
growth
as
those
that
fed
the
inhabitants
of
that
immortal
country
while
the
reminds
us
of
three
such
implements
at
tara
made
by
goibniu
and
associated
with
the
names
of
the
dagda
and
the
morrígú
the
burden
of
collecting
all
these
treasures
was
placed
upon
the
shoulders
of
the
three
sons
of
tuirenn
they
consulted
together
and
agreed
that
they
could
never
hope
to
succeed
unless
they
had
magic
horse
and
magic
coracle
but
both
these
had
been
lent
by
manannán
to
lugh
himself
so
the
sons
of
tuirenn
were
obliged
to
humble
themselves
to
beg
them
from
lugh
the
would
not
lend
them
the
horse
for
fear
of
making
their
task
too
easy
but
he
let
them
have
the
boat
because
he
knew
how
much
the
spear
of
pisear
and
the
horses
of
dobhar
would
be
needed
in
the
coming
war
with
the
fomors
they
bade
farewell
to
their
father
and
went
down
to
the
shore
and
put
out
to
sea
taking
their
sister
with
them
portion
of
the
fine
shall
we
seek
first
said
the
others
to
brian
will
seek
them
in
the
order
in
which
they
were
demanded
he
replied
so
they
directed
the
magic
boat
to
sail
to
the
garden
of
the
hesperides
and
presently
they
arrived
there
they
landed
at
a
harbour
and
held
a
council
of
war
it
was
decided
that
their
best
chance
of
obtaining
three
of
the
apples
would
be
by
taking
the
shapes
of
hawks
thus
they
would
have
strength
enough
in
their
claws
to
carry
the
apples
away
together
with
sufficient
quickness
upon
the
wing
to
hope
to
escape
the
arrows
darts
and
which
would
be
shot
and
hurled
at
them
by
the
warders
of
the
garden
they
swooped
down
upon
the
orchard
from
above
it
was
done
so
swiftly
that
they
carried
off
the
three
apples
unhit
either
by
shaft
or
stone
but
their
difficulties
were
not
yet
over
the
king
of
the
country
had
three
daughters
who
were
well
skilled
in
witchcraft
by
sorcery
they
changed
themselves
into
three
ospreys
and
pursued
the
three
hawks
but
the
sons
of
tuirenn
reached
the
shore
first
and
changing
themselves
into
swans
dived
into
the
sea
they
came
up
close
to
their
coracle
and
got
into
it
and
sailed
swiftly
away
with
the
spoil
thus
their
first
quest
was
finished
and
they
voyaged
on
to
greece
to
seek
the
of
king
tuis
no
one
could
go
without
some
excuse
into
a
court
so
they
decided
to
disguise
themselves
as
poets
and
to
tell
the
that
they
were
professional
bards
from
erin
seeking
largess
at
the
hands
of
kings
the
porter
let
them
into
the
great
hall
where
the
poets
of
greece
were
singing
before
the
king
when
those
had
all
finished
brian
rose
and
asked
permission
to
show
his
art
this
was
accorded
and
he
sang
tuis
we
conceal
not
thy
fame
we
praise
thee
as
the
oak
above
the
kings
the
skin
of
a
pig
bounty
without
hardness
this
is
the
reward
which
i
ask
for
it
stormy
host
and
raging
sea
are
a
dangerous
power
should
one
oppose
it
the
skin
of
a
pig
bounty
without
hardness
this
is
the
reward
i
ask
o
is
a
good
poem
said
the
king
i
do
not
understand
will
explain
it
said
brian
praise
thee
as
the
oak
above
the
this
means
that
as
the
oak
excels
all
other
trees
so
do
you
excel
all
other
kings
in
nobility
and
generosity
skin
of
a
pig
bounty
without
that
is
a
which
you
have
o
tuis
and
which
i
should
like
to
receive
as
the
reward
of
my
poem
stormy
host
and
raging
sea
are
a
dangerous
power
should
one
oppose
this
means
to
say
that
we
are
not
used
to
going
without
anything
on
which
we
have
set
our
hearts
o
should
have
liked
your
poem
better
replied
the
king
my
had
not
been
mentioned
in
it
it
was
not
a
wise
thing
for
you
to
have
done
o
poet
but
i
will
measure
three
fills
of
red
gold
out
of
the
skin
and
you
shall
have
all
good
be
thine
o
king
answered
brian
knew
that
i
should
get
a
noble
so
the
king
sent
for
the
to
measure
out
the
gold
with
but
as
soon
as
brian
saw
it
he
seized
it
with
his
left
hand
and
slew
the
man
who
was
holding
it
and
iuchar
and
iucharba
also
hacked
about
them
and
they
cut
their
way
down
to
the
boat
leaving
the
king
of
greece
among
the
dead
behind
them
now
we
will
go
and
get
king
spear
said
brian
so
leaving
greece
they
sailed
in
their
coracle
to
persia
their
plan
of
disguising
themselves
as
poets
had
served
them
so
well
that
they
decided
to
make
use
of
it
again
so
they
went
into
the
king
of
hall
in
the
same
way
as
they
had
entered
that
of
the
king
of
greece
brian
first
listened
to
the
poets
of
persia
singing
then
he
sang
his
own
song
the
esteem
of
any
spear
with
pisear
the
battles
of
foes
are
broken
no
oppression
to
pisear
everyone
whom
he
wounds
the
finest
of
the
wood
it
is
called
king
without
opposition
may
that
splendid
shaft
drive
on
yon
crowd
into
their
wounds
of
is
a
good
poem
o
man
of
erin
said
the
king
why
is
my
spear
mentioned
in
it
meaning
is
this
replied
brian
should
like
to
receive
that
spear
as
a
reward
for
my
make
a
rash
request
said
the
king
i
spare
your
life
after
having
heard
it
it
will
be
a
sufficient
reward
for
your
brian
had
one
of
the
magic
apples
in
his
hand
and
he
remembered
its
quality
he
hurled
it
full
in
the
king
of
face
dashing
out
his
brains
the
persians
flew
to
arms
but
the
three
sons
of
tuirenn
conquered
them
and
made
them
yield
up
the
spear
they
had
now
to
travel
to
sicily
to
obtain
the
horses
and
chariot
of
king
dobhar
but
they
were
afraid
to
go
as
poets
this
time
for
fear
the
fame
of
their
deeds
might
have
got
abroad
they
therefore
decided
to
pretend
to
be
mercenary
soldiers
from
erin
and
offer
the
king
of
sicily
their
service
this
they
thought
would
be
the
easiest
way
of
finding
out
where
the
horses
and
the
chariot
were
kept
so
they
went
and
stood
on
the
green
before
the
royal
court
when
the
king
of
sicily
heard
that
there
had
come
mercenaries
from
erin
seeking
wages
from
the
kings
of
the
world
he
invited
them
to
take
service
with
him
they
agreed
but
though
they
stayed
with
him
a
fortnight
and
a
month
they
never
saw
the
horses
or
even
found
out
where
they
were
kept
so
they
went
to
the
king
and
announced
that
they
wished
to
leave
him
he
asked
for
he
did
not
want
them
to
go
will
tell
you
o
king
replied
brian
is
because
we
have
not
been
honoured
with
your
confidence
as
we
have
been
accustomed
with
other
kings
you
have
two
horses
and
a
chariot
the
best
in
the
world
and
we
have
not
even
been
allowed
to
see
would
have
shown
them
to
you
on
the
first
day
if
you
had
asked
me
said
the
king
you
shall
see
them
at
once
for
i
have
seldom
had
warriors
with
me
so
good
as
you
are
and
i
do
not
wish
you
to
leave
so
he
sent
for
the
steeds
and
had
them
yoked
to
the
chariot
and
the
sons
of
tuirenn
were
witnesses
of
their
marvellous
speed
and
how
they
could
run
equally
well
over
land
or
water
brian
made
a
sign
to
his
brothers
and
they
watched
their
opportunity
carefully
and
as
the
chariot
passed
close
beside
them
brian
leaped
into
it
hurling
its
driver
over
the
side
then
turning
the
horses
he
struck
king
dobhar
with
spear
and
killed
him
he
took
his
two
brothers
up
into
the
chariot
and
they
drove
away
by
the
time
the
sons
of
tuirenn
reached
the
country
of
easal
king
of
the
pillars
of
gold
rumour
had
gone
before
them
the
king
came
down
to
the
harbour
to
meet
them
and
asked
them
if
it
were
really
true
that
so
many
kings
had
fallen
at
their
hands
they
replied
that
it
was
true
but
that
they
had
no
quarrel
with
any
of
them
only
they
must
obtain
at
all
costs
the
fine
demanded
by
lugh
then
easal
asked
them
why
they
had
come
to
his
land
and
they
told
him
that
they
needed
his
seven
pigs
to
add
to
the
tribute
so
easal
thought
it
better
to
give
them
up
and
to
make
friends
with
the
three
sons
of
tuirenn
than
to
fight
with
such
warriors
the
sons
of
tuirenn
were
very
glad
at
this
for
they
were
growing
weary
of
battles
it
happened
that
the
king
of
ioruaidhe
who
had
the
that
lugh
had
demanded
was
the
husband
of
king
daughter
therefore
king
easal
did
not
wish
that
there
should
be
fighting
between
him
and
the
three
sons
of
tuirenn
he
proposed
to
brian
and
his
brothers
that
he
should
sail
with
them
to
ioruaidhe
and
try
to
persuade
the
king
of
the
country
to
give
up
the
peacefully
they
consented
and
all
set
foot
safely
on
the
wonderful
shores
of
as
the
manuscript
calls
them
but
king
would
not
listen
to
reason
he
assembled
his
warriors
and
fought
but
the
sons
of
tuirenn
defeated
them
and
compelled
their
king
to
yield
up
the
as
the
ransom
for
his
life
all
these
quests
had
been
upon
the
earth
but
the
next
was
harder
no
coracle
not
even
could
penetrate
to
the
island
of
fianchuivé
in
the
depths
of
the
sea
that
severs
erin
from
alba
so
brian
left
his
brothers
and
put
on
his
with
his
transparency
of
glass
upon
his
an
ancient
irish
anticipation
of
the
modern
dress
thus
equipped
he
explored
the
bottom
of
the
sea
for
fourteen
days
before
he
found
the
island
but
when
at
last
he
reached
it
and
entered
the
hall
of
its
queen
she
and
her
were
so
amazed
at
hardihood
in
having
penetrated
to
their
kingdom
that
they
presented
him
with
the
and
sent
him
back
safe
by
this
time
lugh
had
found
out
by
his
magic
arts
that
the
sons
of
tuirenn
had
obtained
all
the
treasures
he
had
demanded
as
the
he
desired
to
get
them
safely
into
his
own
custody
before
his
victims
went
to
give
their
three
shouts
upon
hill
he
therefore
wove
a
druidical
spell
round
them
so
that
they
forgot
the
rest
of
their
task
altogether
and
sailed
back
to
erin
they
searched
for
lugh
to
give
him
the
things
but
he
had
gone
away
leaving
word
that
they
were
to
be
handed
over
to
nuada
the
tuatha
dé
danann
king
as
soon
as
they
were
in
lugh
came
back
to
tara
and
found
the
sons
of
tuirenn
there
and
he
said
to
them
you
not
know
that
it
is
unlawful
to
keep
back
any
part
of
a
so
have
you
given
those
three
shouts
upon
hill
then
the
magic
mist
of
forgetfulness
fell
from
them
and
they
remembered
sorrowfully
they
went
back
to
complete
their
task
miodhchaoin
himself
was
watching
for
them
and
when
he
saw
them
land
he
came
down
to
the
beach
brian
attacked
him
and
they
fought
with
the
swiftness
of
two
bears
and
the
ferocity
of
two
lions
until
miodhchaoin
fell
then
three
conn
and
out
to
avenge
their
father
and
they
drove
their
spears
through
the
bodies
of
the
three
sons
of
tuirenn
but
the
three
sons
of
tuirenn
also
drove
their
spears
through
the
bodies
of
the
three
sons
of
miodhchaoin
the
three
sons
of
miodhchaoin
were
killed
and
the
three
sons
of
tuirenn
were
so
sorely
wounded
that
birds
might
have
flown
through
their
bodies
from
one
side
to
the
other
nevertheless
brian
was
still
able
to
stand
upright
and
he
held
his
two
brothers
one
in
each
hand
and
kept
them
on
their
feet
and
all
together
they
gave
three
faint
feeble
shouts
their
coracle
bore
them
still
living
to
erin
they
sent
their
father
tuirenn
as
a
suppliant
to
lugh
begging
him
to
lend
them
the
magic
to
heal
their
wounds
but
lugh
would
not
for
he
had
counted
upon
their
fight
with
the
sons
of
miodhchaoin
to
avenge
his
father
death
so
the
children
of
tuirenn
resigned
themselves
to
die
and
their
father
made
a
farewell
song
over
them
and
over
himself
and
died
with
them

ends
that
famous

of
the
sons

ix
the
war
with
the
giants
by
this
time
the
seven
years
of
preparation
had
come
to
an
end
a
week
before
the
day
of
samhain
the
morrígú
discovered
that
the
fomors
had
landed
upon
erin
she
at
once
sent
a
messenger
to
tell
the
dagda
who
ordered
his
druids
and
sorcerers
to
go
to
the
ford
of
the
river
unius
in
sligo
and
utter
incantations
against
them
the
people
of
the
goddess
danu
however
were
not
yet
quite
ready
for
battle
so
the
dagda
decided
to
visit
the
fomorian
camp
as
an
ambassador
and
by
parleying
with
them
to
gain
a
little
more
time
the
fomors
received
him
with
apparent
courtesy
and
to
celebrate
his
coming
prepared
him
a
feast
of
porridge
for
it
was
how
fond
he
was
of
such
food
they
poured
into
their
cauldron
which
was
as
deep
as
five
fists
fourscore
gallons
of
new
milk
with
meal
and
bacon
in
proportion
to
this
they
added
the
whole
carcasses
of
goats
sheep
and
pigs
they
boiled
the
mixture
together
and
poured
it
into
a
hole
in
the
ground
said
they
you
do
not
eat
it
all
we
shall
put
you
to
death
for
we
will
not
have
you
go
back
to
your
own
people
and
say
that
the
fomors
are
but
they
did
not
succeed
in
frightening
the
dagda
he
took
his
spoon
which
was
so
large
that
two
persons
of
our
puny
size
might
have
reclined
comfortably
in
the
middle
of
it
dipped
it
into
the
porridge
and
fished
up
halves
of
salted
pork
and
quarters
of
bacon
it
tastes
as
good
as
it
smells
he
said
is
good
and
so
it
proved
for
he
ate
it
all
and
scraped
up
even
what
remained
at
the
bottom
of
the
hole
then
he
went
away
to
sleep
it
off
followed
by
the
laughter
of
the
fomors
for
his
stomach
was
so
swollen
with
food
that
he
could
hardly
walk
it
was
larger
than
the
biggest
cauldron
in
a
large
house
and
stood
out
like
a
sail
before
the
wind
but
the
little
practical
joke
upon
the
dagda
had
given
the
tuatha
dé
danann
time
to
collect
their
forces
it
was
on
the
eve
of
samhain
that
the
two
armies
came
face
to
face
even
then
the
fomors
could
not
believe
that
the
people
of
the
goddess
danu
would
offer
them
much
resistance
you
think
they
will
really
dare
to
give
us
battle
said
bress
to
indech
the
son
of
domnu
they
do
not
pay
their
tribute
we
will
pound
their
bones
for
them
he
replied
the
war
of
gods
and
giants
naturally
mirrored
the
warfare
of
the
gaels
in
whose
battles
as
in
those
of
most
people
single
combat
figured
largely
the
main
armies
stood
still
while
every
day
duels
took
place
between
ambitious
combatants
but
no
great
warriors
either
of
the
tuatha
dé
danann
or
of
the
fomors
took
part
in
them
sometimes
a
god
sometimes
a
giant
would
be
the
victor
but
there
was
a
difference
in
the
net
results
that
astonished
the
fomors
if
their
own
swords
and
lances
were
broken
they
were
of
no
more
use
and
if
their
own
champions
were
killed
they
never
came
back
to
life
again
but
it
was
quite
otherwise
with
the
people
of
the
goddess
danu
weapons
shattered
on
one
day
upon
the
next
in
as
good
condition
as
though
they
had
never
been
used
and
warriors
slain
on
one
day
came
back
upon
the
morrow
unhurt
and
ready
if
necessary
to
be
killed
again
the
fomors
decided
to
send
someone
to
discover
the
secret
of
these
prodigies
the
spy
they
chose
was
ruadan
the
son
of
bress
and
of
brigit
daughter
of
the
dagda
and
therefore
and
he
disguised
himself
as
a
tuatha
dé
danann
warrior
and
went
to
look
for
goibniu
he
found
him
at
his
forge
together
with
luchtainé
the
carpenter
and
credné
the
he
saw
how
goibniu
forged
with
three
blows
of
his
hammer
while
luchtainé
cut
shafts
for
them
with
three
blows
of
his
axe
and
credné
fixed
the
two
parts
together
so
adroitly
that
his
bronze
nails
needed
no
hammering
in
he
went
back
and
told
the
fomors
who
sent
him
again
this
time
to
try
and
kill
goibniu
he
reappeared
at
the
forge
and
asked
for
a
javelin
without
suspicion
goibniu
gave
him
one
and
as
soon
as
he
got
it
into
his
hand
he
thrust
it
through
the
body
but
goibniu
plucked
it
out
and
hurling
it
back
at
his
assailant
mortally
wounded
him
ruadan
went
home
to
die
and
his
father
bress
and
his
mother
brigit
mourned
for
him
inventing
for
the
purpose
the
irish
goibniu
on
the
other
hand
took
no
harm
he
went
to
the
physician
diancecht
who
with
his
daughter
airmid
was
always
on
duty
at
a
miraculous
well
called
the
of
whenever
one
of
the
tuatha
dé
danann
was
killed
or
wounded
he
was
brought
to
the
two
doctors
who
plunged
him
into
the
water
and
brought
him
back
to
life
and
health
again
the
mystic
spring
was
not
long
however
allowed
to
help
the
people
of
the
goddess
a
young
fomorian
chief
octriallach
son
of
indech
found
it
out
he
and
a
number
of
his
companions
went
to
it
by
night
each
carrying
a
large
stone
from
the
bed
of
the
river
drowes
these
they
dropped
into
the
spring
until
they
had
filled
it
dispersed
the
healing
water
and
formed
a
cairn
above
it
legend
has
identified
this
place
by
the
name
of
the
of
this
success
determined
the
fomors
to
fight
a
pitched
battle
they
drew
out
their
army
in
line
there
was
not
a
warrior
in
it
who
had
not
a
coat
of
mail
and
a
helmet
a
stout
spear
a
strong
buckler
and
a
heavy
sword
the
fomors
on
that
says
the
old
author
only
be
compared
to
one
of
three
head
against
a
rock
or
plunging
it
into
a
fire
or
putting
hand
into
a
all
the
great
fighters
of
the
tuatha
dé
danann
were
drawn
out
opposite
to
them
except
lugh
a
council
of
the
gods
had
decided
that
his
varied
accomplishments
made
his
life
too
valuable
to
be
risked
in
battle
they
had
therefore
left
him
behind
guarded
by
nine
warriors
but
at
the
last
moment
lugh
escaped
from
his
warders
and
appeared
in
his
chariot
before
the
army
he
made
them
a
patriotic
speech
bravely
he
said
your
servitude
may
last
no
longer
it
is
better
to
face
death
than
to
live
in
vassalage
and
pay
with
these
encouraging
words
he
drove
round
the
ranks
standing
on
tiptoe
so
that
all
the
tuatha
dé
danann
might
see
him
the
fomors
saw
him
too
and
marvelled
seems
wonderful
to
me
said
bress
to
his
druids
the
sun
should
rise
in
the
west
and
in
the
east
every
other
would
be
better
for
us
if
it
were
so
replied
the
druids
else
can
it
be
then
asked
bress
is
the
radiance
of
the
face
of
lugh
of
the
long
arms
said
they
then
the
two
armies
charged
each
other
with
a
great
shout
spears
and
lances
smote
against
shields
and
so
great
was
the
shouting
of
the
fighters
the
shattering
of
shields
the
clattering
of
swords
the
rattling
of
quivers
and
the
whistling
of
darts
and
javelins
that
it
seemed
as
if
thunder
rolled
everywhere
they
fought
so
closely
that
the
heads
hands
and
feet
of
those
on
one
side
were
touching
the
heads
hands
and
feet
of
those
on
the
other
side
they
shed
so
much
blood
on
to
the
ground
that
it
became
hard
to
stand
on
it
without
slipping
and
the
river
of
unsenn
was
filled
with
dead
bodies
so
hard
and
swift
and
bloody
and
cruel
was
the
battle
many
great
chiefs
fell
on
each
side
ogma
the
champion
of
the
tuatha
dé
danann
killed
indech
the
son
of
the
goddess
domnu
but
meanwhile
balor
of
the
mighty
blows
raged
among
the
gods
slaying
their
king
nuada
of
the
silver
hand
as
well
as
macha
one
of
his
warlike
wives
at
last
he
met
with
lugh
the
shouted
a
challenge
to
his
grandfather
in
the
fomorian
speech
balor
heard
it
and
prepared
to
use
his
eye
up
my
eyelid
he
said
to
his
henchmen
i
may
see
this
chatterer
who
talks
to
the
attendants
lifted
eye
with
a
hook
and
if
the
glance
of
the
eye
beneath
had
rested
upon
lugh
he
would
certainly
have
perished
but
when
it
was
half
opened
lugh
flung
a
magic
stone
which
struck
eye
out
through
the
back
of
his
head
the
eye
fell
on
the
ground
behind
balor
and
destroyed
a
whole
rank
of
thrice
nine
fomors
who
were
unlucky
enough
to
be
within
sight
of
it
an
ancient
poem
has
handed
down
the
secret
of
this
magic
stone
it
is
there
called
a
meaning
a
such
as
the
ancient
irish
warriors
used
sometimes
to
make
out
of
the
brains
of
dead
enemies
hardened
with
lime
tathlum
heavy
fiery
firm
which
the
tuatha
dé
danann
had
with
them
it
was
that
broke
the
fierce
eye
of
old
in
the
battle
of
the
great
armies
blood
of
toads
and
furious
bears
and
the
blood
of
the
noble
lion
the
blood
of
vipers
and
of
trunks
it
was
of
these
the
tathlum
was
composed
sand
of
the
swift
armorian
sea
and
the
sand
of
the
teeming
red
sea
all
these
being
first
purified
were
used
in
the
composition
of
the
tathlum
the
son
of
bethar
no
mean
warrior
who
on
the
eastern
border
reigned
it
was
he
that
fused
and
smoothly
formed
it
was
he
that
fashioned
the
tathlum
the
hero
lugh
was
given
this
concrete
ball
soft
missile
in
mag
tuireadh
of
shrieking
wails
from
his
hand
he
threw
the
this
blinding
of
the
terrible
balor
turned
the
fortunes
of
the
fight
for
the
fomors
wavered
and
the
morrígú
came
and
encouraged
the
people
of
the
goddess
danu
with
a
song
beginning
arise
to
the
so
that
they
took
fresh
heart
and
drove
the
fomors
headlong
back
to
their
country
underneath
the
sea
such
was
the
battle
which
is
called
in
irish
tuireadh
na
that
is
to
say
the
of
the
towers
of
the
and
more
popularly
the
of
moytura
the
to
distinguish
it
from
the
other
battle
of
moytura
fought
by
the
tuatha
dé
danann
against
the
fir
bolgs
farther
to
the
south
more
of
the
fomors
were
killed
in
it
says
the
ancient
manuscript
than
there
are
stars
in
the
sky
grains
of
sand
on
the
in

drops
of

stand
upon
the
plain
of
carrowmore
near
sligo
and
form
in
the
opinion
of

the
finest
collection
of
prehistoric
monuments
in
the
world
with
the
sole
exception
of
carnac
in
brittany
megalithic
structures
of
almost
every
kind
are
found
among
cairns
with
dolmens
in
their
interiors
dolmens
standing
open
and
alone
dolmens
surrounded
by
one
two
or
three
circles
of
stones
and
circles
without
the
number
of
over
a
hundred
of
such
prehistoric
remains
stand
together
upon
an
elevated
plateau
not
more
than
a
mile
across
and
make
the
of
moytura
though
the
least
known
perhaps
the
most
impressive
of
all
primeval
ruins
what
they
really
commemorated
we
may
never
know
but
in
all
probability
the
place
was
the
scene
of
some
important
and
decisive
early
battle
the
monuments
marking
the
graves
of
the
chieftains
who
were
interred
as
the
result
of
it
those
which
have
been
examined
were
found
to
contain
burnt
wood
and
the
bones
of
men
and
horses
as
well
as
implements
of
flint
and
bone
the
actors
therefore
were
still
in
the
neolithic
age
whether
the
horses
were
domesticated
ones
buried
with
their
riders
or
wild
ones
eaten
at
the
funeral
feasts
it
would
be
hard
to
decide
the
history
of
the
real
event
must
have
been
long
lost
even
at
the
early
date
when
its
relics
were
pointed
out
as
the
records
of
a
battle
between
the
gods
and
the
giants
of
gaelic
myth
the
tuatha
dé
danann
following
the
routed
fomors
overtook
and
captured
bress
he
begged
lugh
to
spare
his
life
ransom
will
you
pay
for
it
asked
lugh
will
guarantee
that
the
cows
of
ireland
shall
always
be
in
milk
promised
bress
but
before
accepting
lugh
took
counsel
with
his
druids
good
will
that
be
they
decided
bress
does
not
also
lengthen
the
lives
of
the
cows
this
was
beyond
the
power
of
bress
to
do
so
he
made
another
offer
your
people
he
said
to
lugh
if
they
will
spare
my
life
they
shall
have
a
good
wheat
harvest
every
but
they
said
already
have
the
spring
to
plough
and
sow
in
the
summer
to
ripen
the
crops
the
autumn
for
reaping
and
the
winter
in
which
to
eat
the
bread
and
that
is
all
we
lugh
told
this
to
bress
but
he
also
said
shall
have
your
life
in
return
for
a
much
less
service
to
us
than
is
it
asked
bress
us
when
we
ought
to
plough
when
we
ought
to
sow
and
when
we
ought
to
bress
replied
should
plough
on
a
tuesday
sow
on
a
tuesday
and
harvest
on
a
and
this
lying
maxim
says
the
story
saved
life
lugh
the
dagda
and
ogma
still
pursued
the
fomors
who
had
carried
off
in
their
flight
the
harp
they
followed
them
into
the
submarine
palace
where
bress
and
elathan
lived
and
there
they
saw
the
harp
hanging
on
the
wall
this
harp
of
the
would
not
play
without
its
leave
the
dagda
sang
to
it
oak
of
the
two
cries
come
hand
of
fourfold
music
come
summer
come
winter
voice
of
harps
bellows
and
flutes
for
the
harp
had
these
two
names
it
was
called
of
the
two
and
of
fourfold
it
leaped
down
from
the
wall
killing
nine
of
the
fomors
as
it
passed
and
came
into
the
hand
the
dagda
played
to
the
fomors
the
three
tunes
known
to
all
clever
the
and
the
while
he
played
the
they
were
bowed
with
weeping
while
he
played
the
they
rocked
with
laughter
and
when
he
played
the
they
all
fell
asleep
and
while
they
slept
lugh
the
dagda
and
ogma
got
away
safely
next
the
dagda
brought
the
heifer
which
he
had
by
the
advice
of
angus
son
of
the
young
obtained
from
bress
the
wisdom
of
angus
had
been
shown
in
this
advice
for
it
was
this
very
heifer
that
the
cattle
of
the
people
of
the
goddess
danu
were
accustomed
to
follow
whenever
it
lowed
now
when
it
lowed
all
the
cattle
which
the
fomors
had
taken
away
from
the
tuatha
dé
danann
came
back
again
yet
the
power
of
the
fomors
was
not
wholly
broken
four
of
them
still
carried
on
a
desultory
warfare
by
spoiling
the
corn
fruit
and
milk
of
their
conquerors
but
the
morrígú
and
badb
and
mider
and
angus
pursued
them
and
drove
them
out
of
ireland
for
ever
last
of
all
the
morrígú
and
badb
went
up
on
to
the
summits
of
all
the
high
mountains
of
ireland
and
proclaimed
the
victory
all
the
lesser
gods
who
had
not
been
in
the
battle
came
round
and
heard
the
news
and
badb
sang
a
song
which
began
mounts
to
the
heavens
the
heavens
descend
to
earth
earth
lies
under
the
heavens
everyone
is
strong
but
the
rest
of
it
has
been
lost
and
forgotten
then
she
added
a
prophecy
in
which
she
foretold
the
approaching
end
of
the
divine
age
and
the
beginning
of
a
new
one
in
which
summers
would
be
flowerless
and
cows
milkless
and
women
shameless
and
men
strengthless
in
which
there
would
be
trees
without
fruit
and
seas
without
fish
when
old
men
would
give
false
judgments
and
legislators
make
unjust
laws
when
warriors
would
betray
one
another
and
men
would
be
thieves
and
there
would
be
no
more
virtue
left
in
the
world

gods
by
seems
such
a
strange
one
to
typically
celtic
the
gaelic
mythology
is
the
only
one
which
has
preserved
it
in
any
detail
but
the
doctrine
would
seem
to
have
been
common
at
one
time
to
all
the
celts
it
was
however
of
less
shame
to
the
gods
than
would
otherwise
have
been
for
men
were
of
as
divine
descent
as
themselves
the
dogma
of
the
celts
was
that
men
were
descended
from
the
god
of
death
and
first
came
from
the
land
of
the
dead
to
take
possession
of
the
present
world
caesar
tells
us
in
his
too
short
account
of
the
gauls
that
they
believed
themselves
to
be
sprung
from
dis
pater
the
god
of
the
underworld
in
the
gaelic
mythology
dis
pater
was
called
bilé
a
name
which
has
for
root
the
syllable
meaning
the
god
beli
in
british
mythology
was
no
doubt
the
same
person
while
the
same
idea
is
expressed
by
the
same
root
in
the
name
of
balor
the
terrible
fomor
whose
glance
was
death
the
irish
chroniclers
seeking
to
reconcile
christian
teachings
with
the
still
vital
pagan
mythology
by
changing
the
gods
into
ancient
kings
and
incorporating
them
into
the
annals
of
the
country
with
appropriate
dates
also
disposed
of
the
genuine
early
doctrine
by
substituting
spain
for
hades
and
giving
a
account
of
the
origin
and
wanderings
of
their
ancestors
to
use
a
hibernicism
appropriate
in
this
connection
the
first
irishman
was
a
scythian
called
fenius
farsa
deprived
of
his
own
throne
he
had
settled
in
egypt
where
his
son
niul
married
a
daughter
of
the
reigning
pharaoh
her
name
was
scôta
and
she
had
a
son
called
goidel
whose
was
named
eber
scot
the
whole
genealogy
being
probably
invented
to
explain
the
origin
of
the
three
names
by
which
the
gaels
called
scot
and
goidel
fenius
and
his
family
and
clan
were
turned
out
of
egypt
for
refusing
to
join
in
the
persecution
of
the
children
of
israel
and
sojourned
in
africa
for
years
their
wanderings
took
them
to
altars
of
the
philistines
by
the
lake
of
then
passing
between
rusicada
and
the
hilly
country
of
syria
they
travelled
through
mauretania
as
far
as
the
pillars
of
hercules
and
thence
landed
in
spain
where
they
lived
many
years
greatly
increasing
and
multiplying
the
same
route
is
given
by
the
british
historian
geoffrey
of
monmouth
as
that
taken
by
brutus
and
the
trojans
when
they
came
to
colonize
britain
its
only
connection
with
any
kind
of
fact
is
that
it
corresponds
fairly
well
with
what
ethnologists
consider
must
have
been
the
westward
line
of
migration
taken
not
curiously
enough
by
the
aryan
celts
but
by
the
iberians
it
is
sufficient
for
us
to
find
the
first
men
in
spain
remembering
that
stood
for
the
celtic
hades
or
elysium
in
this
country
bregon
the
father
of
two
sons
bilé
and
ith
had
built
a
from
which
one
evening
ith
saw
far
off
over
the
seas
a
land
he
had
never
noticed
before
is
on
winter
evenings
when
the
air
is
pure
that
eyesight
reaches
remarks
the
old
tract
called
the
of
gravely
accounting
for
the
fact
that
ith
saw
ireland
from
spain
wishing
to
examine
it
nearer
he
set
sail
with
thrice
thirty
warriors
and
landed
without
mishap
at
the
mouth
of
the
river
scêné
the
country
seemed
to
him
to
be
uninhabited
and
he
marched
with
his
men
towards
the
north
at
last
he
reached
aileach
near
the
present
town
of
londonderry
here
he
found
the
three
reigning
kings
of
the
people
of
the
goddess
danu
mac
cuill
mac
cecht
and
mac
greiné
the
sons
of
ogma
and
grandsons
of
the
dagda
these
had
succeeded
nuada
the
killed
in
the
battle
with
the
fomors
and
had
met
after
burying
their
predecessor
in
a
tumulus
called
grianan
aileach
which
still
stands
on
the
base
of
the
inishowen
peninsula
between
lough
swilly
and
lough
foyle
to
divide
his
kingdom
among
them
unable
to
arrive
at
any
partition
satisfactory
to
all
they
appealed
to
the
to
arbitrate
the
advice
of
ith
was
moral
rather
than
practical
according
to
the
laws
of
was
all
that
he
would
say
to
the
claimants
and
then
he
was
indiscreet
enough
to
burst
into
enthusiastic
praises
of
ireland
for
its
temperate
climate
and
its
richness
in
fruit
honey
wheat
and
fish
such
sentiments
from
a
foreigner
seemed
to
the
tuatha
dé
danann
suggestive
of
a
desire
to
take
the
country
from
them
they
conspired
together
and
treacherously
killed
ith
at
a
place
since
called
they
however
spared
his
followers
who
returned
to
taking
their
dead
body
with
them
the
indignation
there
was
great
and
milé
son
and
nephew
determined
to
go
to
ireland
and
get
revenge
milé
therefore
sailed
with
his
eight
sons
and
their
wives
chiefs
each
with
his
shipful
of
warriors
accompanied
him
by
the
magic
arts
of
their
druid
amergin
of
the
fair
knee
they
discovered
the
exact
place
at
which
ith
had
landed
before
them
and
put
in
to
shore
there
two
alone
failed
to
reach
it
alive
the
wife
of
amergin
died
during
the
voyage
and
aranon
a
son
of
milé
on
approaching
the
land
climbed
to
the
top
of
the
mast
to
obtain
a
better
view
and
falling
off
was
drowned
the
rest
disembarked
safely
upon
the
first
of
may
amergin
was
the
first
to
land
planting
his
right
foot
on
irish
soil
he
burst
into
a
poem
preserved
in
both
the
book
of
lecan
and
the
book
of
ballymote
it
is
a
good
example
of
the
pantheistic
philosophy
of
the
celtic
races
and
a
very
close
parallel
to
it
is
contained
in
an
early
welsh
poem
called
the
of

attributed
to
the
famous

strange
to
find
gael

combining
to
voice
almost
in
the
same
words
this
doctrine
of
the
mystical
celts
who
while
still
in
a
state
of
saw
with
some
of
the
greatest
of
ancient
and
modern
philosophers
the
one
in
the
many
and
a
single
essence
in
all
the
manifold
forms
of
life
the
milesians
for
so
following
the
irish
annalists
it
will
be
convenient
to
call
the
first
gaelic
settlers
in
ireland
began
their
march
on
tara
which
was
the
capital
of
the
tuatha
dé
danann
as
it
had
been
in
earlier
days
the
chief
fortress
of
the
fir
bolgs
and
would
in
later
days
be
the
dwelling
of
the
high
kings
of
ireland
on
their
way
they
met
with
a
goddess
called
banba
the
wife
of
mac
cuill
she
greeted
amergin
you
have
come
to
conquer
ireland
she
said
cause
is
no
just
it
is
to
conquer
it
we
have
come
replied
amergin
without
condescending
to
argue
upon
the
abstract
morality
of
the
matter
at
least
grant
me
one
thing
she
asked
is
that
replied
amergin
this
island
shall
be
called
by
my
shall
be
replied
amergin
a
little
farther
on
they
met
a
second
goddess
fotla
the
wife
of
mac
cecht
who
made
the
same
request
and
received
the
same
answer
from
amergin
last
of
all
at
uisnech
the
centre
of
ireland
they
came
upon
the
third
of
the
queens
eriu
the
wife
of
mac
greiné
warriors
she
cried
you
who
have
come
from
afar
this
island
shall
henceforth
belong
and
from
the
setting
to
the
rising
sun
there
is
no
better
land
and
your
race
will
be
the
most
perfect
the
world
has
ever
are
fair
words
and
a
good
prophecy
said
amergin
will
be
no
thanks
to
you
broke
in
donn
eldest
son
success
we
have
we
shall
owe
to
our
own
which
i
prophesy
has
no
concern
with
you
retorted
the
goddess
neither
you
nor
your
descendants
will
live
to
enjoy
this
then
turning
to
amergin
she
too
asked
that
ireland
might
be
called
after
her
shall
be
its
principal
name
amergin
promised
and
so
it
has
happened
of
the
three
ancient
names
of
fotla
and
last
in
its
genitive
form
of
is
the
one
that
has
survived
the
invaders
came
to
tara
then
called
drumcain
that
is
the
mac
cuill
mac
cecht
and
mac
greiné
met
them
with
all
the
host
of
the
gaelic
gods
as
was
usual
they
held
a
parley
the
people
of
the
goddess
danu
complained
that
they
had
been
taken
by
surprise
and
the
milesians
admitted
that
to
invade
a
country
without
having
first
warned
its
inhabitants
was
not
strictly
according
to
the
courtesies
of
chivalrous
warfare
the
tuatha
dé
danann
proposed
to
the
invaders
that
they
should
leave
the
island
for
three
days
during
which
they
themselves
would
decide
whether
to
fight
for
their
kingdom
or
to
surrender
it
but
the
milesians
did
not
care
for
this
for
they
knew
that
as
soon
as
they
were
out
of
the
island
the
tuatha
dé
danann
would
oppose
them
with
druidical
enchantments
so
that
they
would
not
be
able
to
make
a
fresh
landing
in
the
end
mac
cuill
mac
cecht
and
mac
greiné
offered
to
submit
the
matter
to
the
arbitration
of
amergin
the
own
lawgiver
with
the
express
stipulation
that
if
he
gave
an
obviously
partial
judgment
he
was
to
suffer
death
at
their
hands
donn
asked
his
druid
if
he
were
prepared
to
accept
this
very
delicate
duty
amergin
replied
that
he
was
and
at
once
delivered
the
first
judgment
pronounced
by
the
milesians
in
ireland
men
whom
we
found
dwelling
in
the
land
to
them
is
possession
due
by
right
it
is
therefore
your
duty
to
set
out
to
sea
over
nine
green
waves
and
if
you
shall
be
able
to
effect
a
landing
again
in
spite
of
them
you
are
to
engage
them
in
battle
and
i
adjudge
to
you
the
land
in
which
you
found
them
living
i
adjudge
to
you
the
land
wherein
you
found
them
dwelling
by
the
right
of
battle
but
although
you
may
desire
the
land
which
these
people
possess
yet
yours
is
the
duty
to
show
them
justice
i
forbid
you
from
injustice
to
those
you
have
found
in
the
land
however
you
may
desire
to
obtain
this
judgment
was
considered
fair
by
both
parties
the
milesians
retired
to
their
ships
and
waited
at
a
distance
of
nine
length
from
the
land
until
the
signal
was
given
to
attack
while
the
tuatha
dé
danann
drawn
up
upon
the
beach
were
ready
with
their
druidical
spells
to
oppose
them
the
signal
was
given
and
the
milesians
bent
to
their
oars
but
they
had
hardly
started
before
they
discovered
that
a
strong
wind
was
blowing
straight
towards
them
from
the
shore
so
that
they
could
make
no
progress
at
first
they
thought
it
might
be
a
natural
breeze
but
donn
smelt
magic
in
it
he
sent
a
man
to
climb
the
mast
of
his
ship
and
see
if
the
wind
blew
as
strong
at
that
height
as
it
did
at
the
level
of
the
sea
the
man
returned
reporting
that
the
air
was
quite
still
evidently
it
was
a
druidical
wind
but
amergin
soon
coped
with
it
lifting
up
his
voice
he
invoked
the
land
of
ireland
itself
a
power
higher
than
the
gods
it
sheltered
invoke
the
land
of
eriu
the
shining
shining
sea
the
fertile
fertile
hill
the
wooded
vale
the
river
abundant
abundant
in
water
the
fishful
fishful
lake
in
such
strain
runs
the
original
incantation
one
of
those
magic
formulas
whose
power
was
held
by
ancient
and
still
is
held
by
savage
races
to
reside
in
their
exact
consecrated
wording
rather
than
in
their
meaning
to
us
it
sounds
nonsense
and
so
no
doubt
it
did
to
those
who
put
the
old
irish
mythical
traditions
into
literary
shape
for
a
later
version
expands
and
explains
it
as
follows

for

destroyed
their

so
that
they
must

make
a
treaty
of
peace
with
the
dagda
not
until
then
and
thanks
to
his
were
they
able
to
harvest
corn
and
drink
the
milk
of
their
the
basis
of
this
lost
treaty
seems
to
have
been
that
the
tuatha
dé
danann
though
driven
from
the
soil
should
receive
homage
and
offerings
from
their
successors
we
are
told
in

had
however
to

for
new
homes
a
council
was
convened
but
its
members
were
divided
between
two
opinions
one
section
of
them
chose
to
shake
the
dust
of
ireland
off
its
disinherited
feet
and
seek
refuge
in
a
paradise
situate
in
some
unknown
and

unknowable
island
of

full
of
the
beauties

wonders
of

the
tradition
of
it
has
never

out
has
been
set
down
on
old
maps
as
a
reality
again
and
again
some
pioneers
in
the
spanish
seas
thought
they
had
discovered
it
and
called
the
land
they
found
and
it
is
still
said
by
lovers
of
old
lore
that
a
patient
watcher
after
long
gazing
westward
from
the
westernmost
shores
of
ireland
or
scotland
may
sometimes
be
lucky
enough
to

son
of
lêr
but
though
he
had
cast
in
his
lot
beyond
the
seas
he
did
not
cease
to
visit
ireland
an
old
irish
king
bran
the
son
of
febal
met
him
according
to
a
poem
as
bran
journeyed
to

manannán
from
the
earthly
paradise
bran
was
in
his
boat
and
manannán
was
driving
a
chariot
over
the
tops
of
the
waves

he
sang
deems
it
a
marvellous
beauty
in
his
coracle

kept

roman

gold

what
else
it
may

will
never

for

knowth

dowth
it
was
thoroughly
ransacked
by
danish
spoilers
in
the
ninth
century
it
is
entered
by
a
square
doorway
the
rims
of
which
are
elaborately
ornamented
with
a
kind
of
spiral
pattern
this
entrance
leads
to
a
stone
passage
more
than
feet
long
which
gradually
widens
and
rises
until
it
opens
into
a
chamber
with
a
conical
dome
feet
high
on
each
side
of
this
central
chamber
is
a
recess
with
a
shallow
oval
stone
basin
in
it
the
huge
slabs
of
which
the
whole
is
built
are
decorated
upon
both
the
outer
and
the
inner
faces
with
the
same
spiral
pattern
as
the
doorway
the
origin
of
these
astonishing
prehistoric
monuments
is
unknown
but
they
are
generally
attributed
to
the
race
that
inhabited
ireland
before
the
celts
gazing
at
marvellous
new
grange
one
might
very
well
echo
the
words
of
the
old
irish
poet
mac
nia
in
the
book
of
ballymote
the
before
your
eyes
it
is
manifest
to
you
that
it
is
a
mansion
which
was
built
by
the
firm
dagda
it
was
a
wonder
a
court
an
admirable
it
is
not
however
with
new
grange
or
even
with
knowth
or
dowth
that
the
name
is
now
associated
it
is
a
smaller
barrow
nearer
to
the
boyne
which
is
known
as
the
of
the
it
has
never
been
opened
and
james
fergusson
the
author
of
stone
who
holds
the
tuatha
dé
danann
to
have
been
a
real
people
thinks
that
bones
and
armour
of
the
great
dagda
may
still
be
found
in
his
honoured
other
celtic
scholars
might
not
be
so
sanguine
though
verses
as
old
as
the
eleventh
century
assert
that
the
tuatha
dé
danann
used
the
brughs
for
burial
it
was
about
this
period
that
the
mythology
of
ireland
was
being
rewoven
into
spurious
history
the
poem
which
is
called
the
of
the
not
only
mentions
the
of
the
and
the
of
the
but
also
records
the
last
of
ogma
etain
cairpré
lugh
boann
and
angus
we
have
for
the
present
however
to
consider
angus
in
a
far
less
sepulchral
light
he
is
indeed
very
much
alive
in
the
story
to
be
related
the
of
the
was
absent
when
the
distribution
of
the
was
made
when
he
returned
he
came
to
his
father
the
dagda
and
demanded
one
the
dagda
pointed
out
to
him
that
they
had
all
been
given
away
angus
protested
but
what
could
be
done
by
fair
means
evidently
nothing
but
by
craft
a
great
deal
the
wily
angus
appeared
to
reconcile
himself
to
fate
and
only
begged
his
father
to
allow
him
to
stay
at
the
of
new
grange
for
a
day
and
a
night
the
dagda
agreed
to
this
no
doubt
congratulating
himself
on
having
got
out
of
the
difficulty
so
easily
but
when
he
came
to
angus
to
remind
him
that
the
time
was
up
angus
refused
to
go
he
had
been
granted
he
claimed
day
and
night
and
it
is
of
days
and
nights
that
time
and
eternity
are
composed
therefore
there
was
no
limit
to
his
tenure
of
the
the
logic
does
not
seem
very
convincing
to
our
modern
minds
but
the
dagda
is
said
to
have
been
satisfied
with
it
he
abandoned
the
best
of
his
two
palaces
to
his
son
who
took
peaceable
possession
of
it
thus
it
got
a
second
name
that
of
the
or
of
the
of
the
the
dagda
does
not
after
this
play
much
active
part
in
the
history
of
the
people
of
the
goddess
danu
we
next
hear
of
a
council
of
gods
to
elect
a
fresh
ruler
there
were
five
candidates
for
the
vacant
the
red
mider
ilbhreach
son
of
manannán
lêr
and
angus
himself
though
the
we
are
told
had
little
real
desire
to
rule
as
he
preferred
a
life
of
freedom
to
the
dignities
of
kingship
the
tuatha
dé
danann
went
into
consultation
and
the
result
of
their
deliberation
was
that
their
choice
fell
upon
bodb
the
red
for
three
for
his
own
sake
secondly
for
his
father
the
sake
and
thirdly
because
he
was
the
eldest
son
the
other
competitors
approved
this
choice
except
two
mider
refused
to
give
hostages
as
was
the
custom
to
bodb
derg
and
fled
with
his
followers
to
desert
country
round
mount
in
county
carlow
while
lêr
retired
in
great
anger
to
sídh
fionnachaidh
declining
to
recognize
or
obey
the
new
king
why
lêr
and
mider
should
have
so
taken
the
matter
to
heart
is
difficult
to
understand
unless
it
was
because
they
were
both
among
the
oldest
of
the
gods
the
indifference
of
angus
is
easier
to
explain
he
was
the
gaelic
eros
and
was
busy
living
up
to
his
character
at
this
time
the
object
of
his
love
was
a
maiden
who
had
visited
him
one
night
in
a
dream
only
to
vanish
when
he
put
out
his
arms
to
embrace
her
all
the
next
day
we
are
told
angus
took
no
food
upon
the
following
night
the
unsubstantial
lady
again
appeared
and
played
and
sang
to
him
that
following
day
he
also
fasted
so
things
went
on
for
a
year
while
angus
pined
and
wasted
for
love
at
last
the
physicians
of
the
tuatha
dé
danann
guessed
his
complaint
and
told
him
how
fatal
it
might
be
to
him
angus
asked
that
his
mother
boann
might
be
sent
for
and
when
she
came
he
told
her
his
trouble
and
implored
her
help
she
went
to
the
dagda
and
begged
him
if
he
did
not
wish
to
see
his
son
die
of
unrequited
love
a
disease
that
all
medicine
and
magic
could
not
heal
to
find
the
the
dagda
could
do
nothing
himself
but
he
sent
to
bodb
the
red
and
the
new
king
of
the
gods
sent
in
turn
to
the
lesser
deities
of
ireland
ordering
all
of
them
to
search
for
her
for
a
year
she
could
not
be
found
but
at
last
the
disconsolate
lover
received
a
message
charging
him
to
come
and
see
if
he
could
recognize
the
lady
of
his
dreams
angus
came
and
knew
her
at
once
even
though
she
was
surrounded
by
thrice
fifty
attendant
nymphs
her
name
was
caer
and
she
was
the
daughter
of
etal
ambuel
who
had
a
at
uaman
in
connaught
bodb
the
red
demanded
her
for
angus
in
marriage
but
her
father
declared
that
he
had
no
control
over
her
she
was
a
he
said
and
every
year
as
soon
as
summer
was
over
she
went
with
her
companions
to
a
lake
called
and
there
all
of
them
became
swans
but
refusing
to
be
thus
put
off
angus
waited
in
patience
until
the
day
of
the
magical
change
and
then
went
down
to
the
shore
of
the
lake
there
surrounded
by
thrice
fifty
swans
he
saw
caer
herself
a
swan
surpassing
all
the
rest
in
beauty
and
whiteness
he
called
to
her
proclaiming
his
passion
and
his
name
and
she
promised
to
be
his
bride
if
he
too
would
become
a
swan
he
agreed
and
with
a
word
she
changed
him
into
and
thus
they
flew
side
by
side
to
where
they
retook
the
human
form
and
no
doubt
lived
happily
as
long
as
could
be
expected
of
such
changeable
immortals
as
pagan
deities
meanwhile
the
people
of
the
goddess
danu
were
justly
incensed
against
both
lêr
and
mider
bodb
the
red
made
a
yearly
war
upon
mider
in
his
and
many
of
the
divine
race
were
killed
on
either
side
but
against
lêr
the
new
king
of
the
gods
refused
to
move
for
there
had
been
a
great
affection
between
them
many
times
bodb
derg
tried
to
regain
friendship
by
presents
and
compliments
but
for
a
long
time
without
success
at
last
wife
died
to
the
great
sorrow
when
bodb
the
red
heard
the
news
he
sent
a
messenger
to
lêr
offering
him
one
of
his
own
aebh
aeife
and
ailbhe
the
children
of
ailioll
of
arran
lêr
touched
by
this
came
to
visit
bodb
the
red
at
his
and
chose
aebh
for
his
wife
is
the
eldest
so
she
must
be
the
noblest
of
them
he
said
they
were
married
and
a
great
feast
made
and
lêr
took
her
back
with
him
to
sídh
fionnachaidh
aebh
bore
four
children
to
lêr
the
eldest
was
a
daughter
called
finola
the
second
was
a
son
called
aed
the
two
others
were
twin
boys
called
fiachra
and
conn
but
in
giving
birth
to
those
aebh
died
bodb
the
red
then
offered
lêr
another
of
his
and
he
chose
the
second
aeife
every
year
lêr
and
aeife
and
the
four
children
used
to
go
to
of
which
was
held
at
each
of
the
in
turn
the
four
children
grew
up
to
be
great
favourites
among
the
people
of
the
goddess
danu
but
aeife
was
childless
and
she
became
jealous
of
children
for
she
feared
that
he
would
love
them
more
than
he
did
her
she
brooded
over
this
until
she
began
first
to
hope
for
and
then
to
plot
their
deaths
she
tried
to
persuade
her
servants
to
murder
them
but
they
would
not
so
she
took
the
four
children
to
lake
darvra
now
called
lough
derravargh
in
west
meath
and
sent
them
into
the
water
to
bathe
then
she
made
an
incantation
over
them
and
touched
them
each
in
turn
with
a
druidical
wand
and
changed
them
into
swans
but
though
she
had
magic
enough
to
alter
their
shapes
she
had
not
the
power
to
take
away
their
human
speech
and
minds
finola
turned
and
threatened
her
with
the
anger
of
lêr
and
of
bodb
the
red
when
they
came
to
hear
of
it
she
however
hardened
her
heart
and
refused
to
undo
what
she
had
done
the
children
of
lêr
finding
their
case
a
hopeless
one
asked
her
how
long
she
intended
to
keep
them
in
that
condition
would
be
easier
in
mind
she
said
you
had
not
asked
the
question
but
i
will
tell
you
you
shall
be
three
hundred
years
here
on
lake
darvra
and
three
hundred
years
upon
the
sea
of
moyle
which
is
between
erin
and
alba
and
three
hundred
years
more
at
irros
domnann
and
the
isle
of
glora
in
erris
yet
you
shall
have
two
consolations
in
your
troubles
you
shall
keep
your
human
minds
and
yet
suffer
no
grief
at
knowing
that
you
have
been
changed
into
swans
and
you
shall
be
able
to
sing
the
softest
and
sweetest
songs
that
were
ever
heard
in
the
then
aeife
went
away
and
left
them
she
returned
to
lêr
and
told
him
that
the
children
had
fallen
by
accident
into
lake
darvra
and
were
drowned
but
lêr
was
not
satisfied
that
she
spoke
the
truth
and
went
in
haste
to
the
lake
to
see
if
he
could
find
traces
of
them
he
saw
four
swans
close
to
the
shore
and
heard
them
talking
to
one
another
with
human
voices
as
he
approached
they
came
out
of
the
water
to
meet
him
they
told
him
what
aeife
had
done
and
begged
him
to
change
them
back
into
their
own
shapes
but
magic
was
not
so
powerful
as
his
and
he
could
not
nor
even
could
bodb
the
whom
lêr
went
for
help
all
that
he
was
king
of
the
gods
what
aeife
had
done
could
not
be
undone
but
she
could
be
punished
for
it
bodb
ordered
his
to
appear
before
him
and
when
she
came
he
put
an
oath
on
her
to
tell
him
truly
shape
of
all
others
on
the
earth
or
above
the
earth
or
beneath
the
earth
she
most
abhorred
and
into
which
she
most
dreaded
to
be
aeife
was
obliged
to
answer
that
she
most
feared
to
become
a
demon
of
the
air
so
bodb
the
red
struck
her
with
his
wand
and
she
fled
from
them
a
shrieking
demon
all
the
tuatha
dé
danann
went
to
lake
darvra
to
visit
the
four
swans
the
milesians
heard
of
it
and
also
went
for
it
was
not
till
long
after
this
that
gods
and
mortals
ceased
to
associate
the
visit
became
a
yearly
feast
but
at
the
end
of
three
hundred
years
the
children
of
lêr
were
compelled
to
leave
lake
darvra
and
go
to
the
sea
of
moyle
to
fulfil
the
second
period
of
their
exile
they
bade
farewell
to
gods
and
men
and
went
and
for
fear
lest
they
might
be
hurt
by
anyone
the
milesians
made
it
law
in
ireland
that
no
man
should
harm
a
swan
from
that
time
forth
for
ever
the
children
of
lêr
suffered
much
from
tempest
and
cold
on
the
stormy
sea
of
moyle
and
they
were
very
lonely
once
only
during
that
long
three
hundred
years
did
they
see
any
of
their
friends
an
embassy
of
the
tuatha
dé
danann
led
by
two
sons
of
bodb
the
red
came
to
look
for
them
and
told
them
all
that
had
happened
in
erin
during
their
exile
at
last
that
long
penance
came
to
an
end
and
they
went
to
irros
domnann
and
innis
glora
for
their
third
stage
and
while
it
was
wearily
dragging
through
saint
patrick
came
to
ireland
and
put
an
end
to
the
power
of
the
gods
for
ever
they
had
been
banned
and
banished
when
the
children
of
lêr
found
themselves
free
to
return
to
their
old
home
sídh
fionnechaidh
was
empty
and
deserted
for
lêr
had
been
killed
by
caoilté
the
cousin
of
finn
mac
coul
so
after
long
vain
searching
for
their
lost
relatives
they
gave
up
hope
and
returned
to
the
isle
of
glora
they
had
a
friend
there
the
lonely
crane
of
inniskea
which
has
lived
upon
that
island
ever
since
the
beginning
of
the
world
and
will
be
still
sitting
there
on
the
day
of
judgment
they
saw
no
one
else
until
one
day
a
man
came
to
the
island
he
told
them
that
he
was
saint
caemhoc
and
that
he
had
heard
their
story
he
brought
them
to
his
church
and
preached
the
new
faith
to
them
and
they
believed
on
christ
and
consented
to
be
baptised
this
broke
the
pagan
spell
and
as
soon
as
the
holy
water
was
sprinkled
over
them
they
returned
to
human
shape
but
they
were
very
old
and
aged
men
and
an
ancient
woman
they
did
not
live
long
after
this
and
saint
caemhoc
who
had
baptised
them
buried
them
all
together
in
one
grave
but
in
telling
this
story
we
have
leaped
nine
hundred
great
space
in
the
history
even
of
gods
we
must
retrace
our
steps
if
not
quite
to
the
days
of
eremon
and
eber
sons
of
milé
and
first
kings
of
ireland
at
any
rate
to
the
beginning
of
the
christian
era
at
this
time
eochaid
airem
was
high
king
of
ireland
and
reigned
at
tara
while
under
him
as
vassal
monarchs
conchobar
mac
nessa
ruled
over
the
red
branch
champions
of
ulster
curoi
son
of
daire
was
king
of
munster
mesgegra
was
king
of
leinster
and
ailell
with
his
famous
queen
medb
governed
connaught
shortly
before
among
the
gods
angus
son
of
the
young
had
stolen
away
etain
the
wife
of
mider
he
kept
her
imprisoned
in
a
bower
of
glass
which
he
carried
everywhere
with
him
never
allowing
her
to
leave
it
for
fear
mider
might
recapture
her
the
gaelic
pluto
however
found
out
where
she
was
and
was
laying
plans
to
rescue
her
when
a
rival
of
herself
decoyed
angus
away
from
before
the
pleasant
and
set
his
captive
free
but
instead
of
returning
her
to
mider
she
changed
the
luckless
goddess
into
a
fly
and
threw
her
into
the
air
where
she
was
tossed
about
in
great
wretchedness
at
the
mercy
of
every
wind
at
the
end
of
seven
years
a
gust
blew
her
on
to
the
roof
of
the
house
of
etair
one
of
the
vassals
of
conchobar
who
was
celebrating
a
feast
the
unhappy
fly
who
was
etain
was
blown
down
the
chimney
into
the
room
below
and
fell
exhausted
into
a
golden
cup
full
of
beer
which
the
wife
of
the
master
of
the
house
was
just
going
to
drink
and
the
woman
drank
etain
with
the
beer
but
of
course
this
was
not
the
end
of
the
gods
can
not
really
die
only
the
beginning
of
a
new
life
etain
was
reborn
as
the
daughter
of
wife
no
one
knowing
that
she
was
not
of
mortal
lineage
she
grew
up
to
be
the
most
beautiful
woman
in
ireland
when
she
was
twenty
years
old
her
fame
reached
the
high
king
who
sent
messengers
to
see
if
she
was
as
fair
as
men
reported
they
saw
her
and
returned
to
the
king
full
of
her
praises
so
eochaid
himself
went
to
pay
her
a
visit
he
chose
her
to
be
his
queen
and
gave
her
a
splendid
dowry
it
was
not
till
then
that
mider
heard
of
her
he
came
to
her
in
the
shape
of
a
young
man
beautifully
dressed
and
told
her
who
she
really
was
and
how
she
had
been
his
wife
among
the
people
of
the
goddess
danu
he
begged
her
to
leave
the
king
and
come
with
him
to
his
at
bri
leith
but
etain
refused
with
scorn
you
think
she
said
i
would
give
up
the
high
king
of
ireland
for
a
person
whose
name
and
kindred
i
do
not
know
except
from
his
own
lips
the
god
retired
baffled
for
the
time
but
one
day
as
king
eochaid
sat
in
his
hall
a
stranger
entered
he
was
dressed
in
a
purple
tunic
his
hair
was
like
gold
and
his
eyes
shone
like
candles
the
king
welcomed
him
who
are
you
he
asked
i
do
not
know
i
have
known
you
a
long
time
returned
the
stranger
what
is
your
name
a
very
famous
one
i
am
mider
of
bri
have
you
come
here
challenge
you
to
a
game
of
am
a
good
replied
the
king
who
was
reputed
to
be
the
best
in
ireland
think
i
can
beat
you
answered
mider
the
is
in
the
room
and
she
is
asleep
objected
eochaid
does
not
matter
replied
mider
have
brought
a
board
with
me
which
can
be
in
no
way
worse
than
he
showed
it
to
the
king
who
admitted
that
the
boast
was
true
the
was
made
of
silver
set
in
precious
stones
and
the
pieces
were
of
gold
said
mider
to
the
king
never
play
without
a
wager
replied
eochaid
shall
be
the
stake
asked
mider
do
not
care
replied
eochaid
returned
mider
it
be
that
the
loser
pays
whatever
the
winner
is
a
wager
fit
for
a
king
said
eochaid
they
played
and
mider
lost
the
stake
that
eochaid
claimed
from
him
was
that
mider
and
his
subjects
should
make
a
road
through
ireland
eochaid
watched
the
road
being
made
and
noticed
how
followers
yoked
their
oxen
not
by
the
horns
as
the
gaels
did
but
at
the
shoulders
which
was
better
he
adopted
the
practice
and
thus
got
his
nickname
airem
that
is
after
a
year
mider
returned
and
challenged
the
king
again
the
terms
to
be
the
same
as
before
eochaid
agreed
with
joy
but
this
time
he
lost
could
have
beaten
you
before
if
i
had
wished
said
mider
now
the
stake
i
demand
is
etain
your
the
astonished
king
who
could
not
for
shame
go
back
upon
his
word
asked
for
a
delay
mider
agreed
to
return
upon
that
day
year
to
claim
etain
eochaid
consulted
with
his
warriors
and
they
decided
to
keep
watch
through
the
whole
of
the
day
fixed
by
mider
and
let
no
one
pass
in
or
out
of
the
royal
palace
till
sunset
for
eochaid
held
that
if
the
fairy
king
could
not
get
etain
upon
that
one
day
his
promise
would
be
no
longer
binding
on
him
so
when
the
day
came
they
barred
the
door
and
guarded
it
but
suddenly
they
saw
mider
among
them
in
the
hall
he
stood
beside
etain
and
sang
this
song
to
her
setting
out
the
pleasures
of
the
homes
of
the
gods
under
the
enchanted
hills
fair
lady
will
you
come
with
me
to
a
wonderful
country
which
is
mine
where
the
hair
is
of
golden
hue
and
their
bodies
the
colour
of
virgin
snow
no
grief
or
care
is
known
white
are
their
teeth
black
their
eyelashes
delight
of
the
eye
is
the
rank
of
our
hosts
with
the
hue
of
the
on
every
cheek
are
the
flowers
of
every
mead
gracefully
speckled
as
the
egg
though
beautiful
to
see
be
the
plains
of
inisfail
they
are
but
commons
compared
to
our
great
plains
intoxicating
to
you
be
the
of
inisfail
more
intoxicating
the
ales
of
the
great
country
the
only
land
to
praise
is
the
land
of
which
i
speak
where
no
one
ever
dies
of
decrepit
age
sweet
streams
traverse
the
land
the
choicest
of
mead
and
of
wine
beautiful
people
without
any
blemish
love
without
sin
without
wickedness
can
see
the
people
upon
all
sides
but
by
no
one
can
we
be
seen
the
cloud
of
transgression
it
is
that
prevents
them
from
seeing
us
lady
should
you
come
to
my
brave
land
it
is
golden
hair
that
will
be
on
your
head
fresh
pork
beer
new
milk
and
ale
you
there
with
me
shall
have
o
fair
lady
then
mider
greeted
eochaid
and
told
him
that
he
had
come
to
take
away
etain
according
to
the
wager
and
while
the
king
and
his
warriors
looked
on
helplessly
he
placed
one
arm
round
the
now
willing
woman
and
they
both
vanished
this
broke
the
spell
that
hung
over
everyone
in
the
hall
they
rushed
to
the
door
but
all
they
could
see
were
two
swans
flying
away
the
king
would
not
however
yield
to
the
god
he
sent
to
every
part
of
ireland
for
news
of
etain
but
his
messengers
all
came
back
without
having
been
able
to
find
her
at
last
a
druid
named
dalân
learned
by
means
of
ogams
carved
upon
wands
of
yew
that
she
was
hidden
under
of
bri
leith
so
eochaid
marched
there
with
an
army
and
began
to
dig
deep
into
the
abode
of
the
gods
of
which
the
was
the
portal
mider
as
terrified
as
was
the
greek
god
hades
when
it
seemed
likely
that
the
earth
would

xii
the
irish
iliad
with
eber
and
eremon
sons
of
milé
and
conquerors
of
the
gods
begins
a
fresh
series
of
characters
in
gaelic
early
kings
of
ireland
though
monkish
chroniclers
have
striven
to
find
history
in
the
legends
handed
down
concerning
them
they
are
none
the
less
almost
as
mythical
as
the
tuatha
dé
danann
the
first
of
them
who
has
the
least
appearance
of
reality
is
tigernmas
who
is
recorded
to
have
reigned
a
hundred
years
after
the
coming
of
the
milesians
he
seems
to
have
been
what
is
sometimes
called
a
bearing
much
the
same
kind
of
relation
to
ireland
as
theseus
bore
to
athens
or
minos
to
crete
during
his
reign
nine
new
lakes
and
three
new
rivers
broke
forth
from
beneath
the
earth
to
give
their
waters
to
erin
under
his
auspices
gold
was
first
smelted
ornaments
of
gold
and
silver
were
first
made
and
clothes
first

he
is
said
to
have
perished
mysteriously
with
of
the
men
of
erin
while
worshipping
cromm
cruaich
on
the
field
of
mag
slecht
in
him
nutt
sees
no
doubt
rightly
the
great
mythical
king
who
in
almost
all
national
histories
closes
the
strictly
mythological
age
and
inaugurates
a
new
era
of
less
obviously
divine
if
hardly
less
apocryphal
characters
in
spite
however
of
the
worship
of
the
tuatha
dé
danann
instituted
by
eremon
we
find
the
early
kings
and
heroes
of
ireland
walking
very
familiarly
with
their
gods
eochaid
airem
high
king
of
ireland
was
apparently
reckoned
a
perfectly
fit
suitor
for
the
goddess
etain
and
proved
a
far
from
unsuccessful
rival
of
mider
the
gaelic
pluto
and
adventures
of
love
or
war
were
carried
quite
as
cheerfully
among
the
dwellers
by
son
of
nessa
king
of
ulster
curoi
son
of
daire
king
of
munster
mesgegra
king
of
leinster
and
ailell
and
medb
king
and
queen
of
connaught
all
these
figures
of
the
second
gaelic
cycle
that
of
the
heroes
of
ulster
and
especially
of
their
great
champion
cuchulainn
lived
according
to
irish
tradition
at
about
the
beginning
of
the
christian
era
conchobar
indeed
is
said
to
have
expired
in
a
fit
of
rage
on
hearing
of
the
death
of
christ
but
this
is
a
very
transparent
monkish
interpolation
into
the
original
story
a
quite
different
view
is
taken
by
most
modern
scholars
who
would
see
gods
and
not
men
in
all
the
legendary
characters
of
the
celtic
heroic
cycles
upon
such
a
subject
however
one
may
legitimately
take
sides
were
king
conchobar
and
his
ultonian
champions
finn
and
his
fenians
arthur
and
his
knights
once
living
men
round
whom
the
attributes
of
gods
have
gathered
or
were
they
ancient
deities
renamed
and
stripped
of
some
of
their
divinity
to
make
them
more
akin
to
their
human
worshippers
history
or
mythology
a
mingling
perhaps
of
both
cuchulainn
may
have
been
the
name
of
a
real
gaelic
warrior
however
suspiciously
he
may
now
resemble
the
who
is
said
to
have
been
his
father
king
conchobar
may
have
been
the
real
chief
of
a
tribe
of
irish
celts
before
he
became
an
adumbration
of
the
gaelic
it
is
the
same
problem
that
confronts
us
in
dealing
with
the
heroic
legends
of
greece
and
rome
were
achilles
agamemnon
odysseus
paris
æneas
gods
or
men
let
us
call
them
all
they
be
greek
or
trojan
heroes
red
branch
champions
or
followers
of
the
gaelic
finn
or
the
british
even
so
they
stand
definitely
apart
from
the
older
gods
who
were
greater
than
they
were
we
are
stretching
no
point
in
calling
them
for
they
were
cuchulainn
the
greatest
hero
of
the
ulster
cycle
was
doubly
so
for
on
his
side
he
was
the
grandson
of
the
dagda
while
lugh
of
the
long
hand
is
said
to
have
been
his
father
his
mother
dechtiré
daughter
of
maga
the
daughter
of
angus
of
the
was
to
king
conchobar
and
all
the
other
principal
heroes
were
of
hardly
less
lofty
descent
it
is
small
wonder
that
they
are
described
in
ancient
manuscripts
as
terrestrial
gods
and
goddesses
they
may
have
been
in
form
but
their
acts
were
superhuman
indeed
compared
with
the
more
modest
exploits
of
the
heroes
of
the
they
were
those
of
giants
where
greek
warriors
slew
their
tens
these
ultonians
despatched
their
hundreds
they
came
home
after
such
exploits
so
heated
that
their
cold
baths
boiled
over
when
they
sat
down
to
meat
they
devoured
whole
oxen
and
drank
their
mead
from
vats
with
one
stroke
of
their
favourite
swords
they
beheaded
hills
for
sport
the
gods
themselves
hardly
did
more
and
it
is
easy
to
understand
that
in
those
old
days
not
only
might
the
sons
of
gods
look
upon
the
daughters
of
men
and
find
them
fair
but
immortal
women
also
need
not
be
too
proud
to
form
passing
alliances
with
mortal
men
some
of
the
older
deities
seem
to
have
already
passed
out
of
memory
at
the
time
of
the
compilation
of
the
ulster
cycle

any
rate

recognized
as
dwellers

who
at
times
raid
upon
the
coast
and
do
battle
with
the
heroes
over
whom
conchobar
ruled
at
emain
macha
this
seat
of
his
government
the
traditionary
site
of
which
is
still
marked
by
an
extensive
prehistoric
entrenchment
called
navan
fort
near
armagh
was
the
centre
of
an
ulster
that
stretched
southwards
as
far
as
the
boyne
and
round
its
ruler
gathered
such
a
galaxy
of
warriors
as
ireland
had
never
seen
before
or
will
again
they
called
themselves
the
of
the
red
there
was
not
one
of
them
who
was
not
a
hero
but
they
are
all
dwarfed
by
one
splendid
whose
name
means
alfred
nutt
calls
him
irish
while
professor
rhys
would
rather
see
in
him
a
heracles
of
the
gaels
like
achilles
he
was
the
chosen
hero
of
his
people
invincible
in
battle
and
yet
once
to
early
death
and
sorrows
doomed
beyond
the
lot
of
while
like
heracles
his
life
was
a
series
of
wonderful
exploits
and
labours
it
matters
little
enough
for
the
lives
of
all
such
mythical
heroes
must
be
of
necessity
somewhat
alike
if
achilles
and
heracles
were
as
some
think
personifications
of
the
sun
cuchulainn
is
not
less
so
most
of
his
attributes
as
the
old
stories
record
them
are
obviously
solar
symbols
he
seemed
generally
small
and
insignificant
yet
when
he
was
at
his
full
strength
no
one
could
look
him
in
the
face
without
blinking
while
the
heat
of
his
constitution
melted
snow
for
thirty
feet
all
round
him
he
turned
red
and
hissed
as
he
dipped
his
body
into
its
sea
terrible
was
his
transformation
when
sorely
oppressed
by
his
enemies
as
the
sun
is
by
mist
storm
or
eclipse
at
such
times
the
aërial
clouds
over
his
head
were
visible
the
virulent
pouring
showers
and
sparks
of
ruddy
fire
which
the
seething
of
his
savage
wrath
caused
to
mount
up
above
him
his
hair
became
tangled
about
his
head
as
it
had
been
branches
of
a
red
stuffed
into
a
gap
taller
thicker
more
rigid
longer
than
mast
of
a
great
ship
was
the
perpendicular
jet
of
dusky
blood
which
out
of
his
very
central
point
shot
upwards
and
then
was
scattered
to
the
four
cardinal
points
whereby
was
formed
a
magic
mist
of
gloom
resembling
the
smoky
pall
that
drapes
a
regal
dwelling
what
time
a
king
at
nightfall
of
a
day
draws
near
to
so
marvellous
a
being
was
of
course
of
marvellous
birth
his
mother
dechtiré
was
on
the
point
of
being
married
to
an
ulster
chieftain
called
sualtam
and
was
sitting
at
the
when
a
flew
into
her
cup
of
wine
and
was
unwittingly
swallowed
by
her
that
same
afternoon
she
fell
into
a
deep
sleep
and
in
her
dream
the
lugh
appeared
to
her
and
told
her
that
it
was
he
whom
she
had
swallowed
and
bore
within
her
he
ordered
her
and
her
fifty
attendant
maidens
to
come
with
him
at
once
and
he
put
upon
them
the
shapes
of
birds
so
that
they
were
not
seen
to
go
nothing
was
heard
of
them
again
but
one
day
months
later
a
flock
of
beautiful
birds
appeared
before
emain
macha
and
drew
out
its
warriors
in
their
chariots
to
hunt
them
they
followed
the
birds
till
nightfall
when
they
found
themselves
at
the
brugh
on
the
boyne
where
the
great
gods
had
their
homes
as
they
looked
everywhere
for
shelter
they
suddenly
saw
a
splendid
palace
a
tall
and
handsome
man
richly
dressed
came
out
and
welcomed
them
and
led
them
in
within
the
hall
were
a
beautiful
and
woman
and
fifty
maidens
and
on
the
tables
were
the
richest
meats
and
wines
and
everything
fit
for
the
needs
of
warriors
so
they
rested
there
the
night
and
during
the
night
they
heard
the
cry
of
a
child
the
next
morning
the
man
told
them
who
he
was
and
that
the
woman
was
dechtiré
and
he
ordered
them
to
take
the
child
and
bring
it
up
among
the
warriors
of
ulster
so
they
brought
him
back
together
with
his
mother
and
the
maidens
and
dechtiré
married
sualtam
and
all
the
chiefs
champions
druids
poets
and
lawgivers
of
ulster
vied
with
one
another
in
bringing
up
the
mysterious
infant
at
first
they
called
him
setanta
and
this
is
how
he
came
to
change
his
name
while
still
a
child
he
was
the
strongest
of
the
boys
of
emain
macha
and
the
champion
in
their
sports
one
day
he
was
playing
hurley
against
all
the
others
and
beating
them
when
conchobar
the
king
rode
by
with
his
nobles
on
the
way
to
a
banquet
given
by
culann
the
chief
smith
of
the
ultonians
conchobar
called
to
the
boy
inviting
him
to
go
with
them
and
he
replied
that
when
the
game
was
finished
he
would
follow
as
soon
as
the
ulster
champions
were
in
hall
the
smith
asked
the
leave
to
unloose
his
terrible
which
was
as
strong
and
fierce
as
a
hundred
hounds
and
conchobar
forgetting
that
the
boy
was
to
follow
them
gave
his
permission
immediately
the
hound
saw
setanta
coming
it
rushed
at
him
but
the
boy
flung
his
into
its
mouth
and
then
seizing
it
by
the
dashed
it
against
a
rock
till
he
had
killed
it
the
smith
culann
was
very
angry
at
the
death
of
his
dog
for
there
was
no
other
hound
in
the
world
like
him
for
guarding
a
house
and
flocks
so
setanta
promised
to
find
and
train
up
another
one
not
less
good
for
culann
and
until
it
was
trained
to
guard
the
house
as
though
he
were
a
dog
himself
this
is
why
he
was
called
cuchulainn
that
is
and
cathbad
the
druid
prophesied
that
the
time
would
come
when
the
name
would
be
in
every
mouth
not
long
after
this
cuchulainn
overheard
cathbad
giving
druidical
instruction
and
one
of
his
pupils
asking
him
what
that
day
would
be
propitious
for
cathbad
replied
that
if
any
young
man
first
took
arms
on
that
day
his
name
would
be
greater
than
that
of
any
other
but
his
life
would
be
short
at
once
the
boy
went
to
king
conchobar
and
demanded
arms
and
a
chariot
conchobar
asked
him
who
had
put
such
a
thought
into
his
head
and
he
answered
that
it
was
cathbad
the
druid
so
conchobar
gave
him
arms
and
armour
and
sent
him
out
with
a
charioteer
that
evening
cuchulainn
brought
back
the
heads
of
three
champions
who
had
killed
many
of
the
warriors
of
ulster
he
was
then
only
seven
years
old
the
women
of
ulster
so
loved
cuchulainn
after
this
that
the
warriors
grew
jealous
and
insisted
that
a
wife
should
be
found
for
him
but
cuchulainn
was
very
hard
to
please
he
would
have
only
one
emer
the
daughter
of
forgall
the
wily
the
best
maiden
in
ireland
for
the
six
gift
of
beauty
the
gift
of
voice
the
gift
of
sweet
speech
the
gift
of
needlework
the
gift
of
wisdom
and
the
gift
of
chastity
so
he
went
to
woo
her
but
she
laughed
at
him
for
a
boy
then
cuchulainn
swore
by
the
gods
of
his
people
that
he
would
make
his
name
known
wherever
the
deeds
of
heroes
were
spoken
of
and
emer
promised
to
marry
him
if
he
could
take
her
from
her
warlike
kindred
when
forgall
her
father
came
to
know
of
this
betrothal
he
devised
a
plan
to
put
an
end
to
it
he
went
to
visit
king
conchobar
at
emain
macha
there
he
pretended
to
have
heard
of
cuchulainn
for
the
first
time
and
he
saw
him
do
all
his
feats
he
said
loud
enough
to
be
overheard
by
all
that
if
so
promising
a
youth
dared
to
go
to
the
island
of
scathach
the
amazon
in
the
east
of
alba
and
learn
all
her
no
living
man
would
be
able
to
stand
before
him
it
was
hard
to
reach
isle
and
still
harder
to
return
from
it
and
forgall
felt
certain
that
if
cuchulainn
went
he
would
get
his
death
there
of
course
nothing
would
now
satisfy
cuchulainn
but
going
his
two
friends
laegaire
the
and
conall
the
victorious
said
that
they
would
go
with
him
but
before
they
had
gone
far
they
lost
heart
and
turned
back
cuchulainn
went
on
alone
crossing
the
plain
of
where
feet
stuck
fast
while
sharp
grasses
sprang
up
and
cut
them
and
through
the
perilous
glens
full
of
devouring
wild
beasts
until
he
came
to
the
bridge
of
the
cliff
which
rose
on
end
till
it
stood
straight
up
like
a
mast
as
soon
as
anyone
put
foot
on
it
three
times
cuchulainn
tried
to
cross
it
and
thrice
he
failed
then
anger
came
into
his
heart
and
a
magic
halo
shone
round
his
head
and
he
did
his
famous
feat
of
the
salmon
and
landed
in
one
jump
on
the
middle
of
the
bridge
and
then
slid
down
it
as
it
rose
up
on
end
scathach
was
in
the
with
her
two
sons
cuchulainn
went
to
her
and
put
his
sword
to
her
breast
and
threatened
to
kill
her
if
she
would
not
teach
him
all
her
own
skill
in
arms
so
he
became
her
pupil
and
she
taught
him
all
her
in
return
cuchulainn
helped
her
against
a
rival
queen
of
the
amazons
called
aoife
he
conquered
aoife
and
compelled
her
to
make
peace
with
scathach
then
he
returned
to
ireland
and
went
in
a
scythed
chariot
to
palace
he
leaped
over
its
triple
walls
and
slew
everyone
who
came
near
him
forgall
met
his
death
in
trying
to
escape
rage
he
found
emer
and
placed
her
in
his
chariot
and
drove
away
and
every
time
that
warriors
came
up
to
them
he
turned
and
slew
a
hundred
and
put
the
rest
to
flight
he
reached
emain
macha
in
safety
and
he
and
emer
were
married
there
and
so
great
after
this
were
the
fame
of
prowess
and
beauty
that
the
men
and
women
of
ulster
yielded
them
among
the
warriors
and
her
among
the
every
feast
and
banquet
at
emain
macha
but
all
that
cuchulainn
had
done
up
to
this
time
was
as
nothing
to
the
deeds
he
did
in
the
great
war
which
all
the
rest
of
ireland
headed
by
ailill
and
medb
king
and
queen
of
connaught
made
upon
ulster
to
get
the
brown
bull
of
cualgne
this
bull
was
one
of
two
of
fairy
descent
they
had
originally
been
the
swineherds
of
two
of
the
gods
bodb
king
of
the
sídhe
of
munster
and
ochall
ochne
king
of
the
sídhe
of
connaught
as
swineherds
they
were
in
perpetual
rivalry
then
the
better
to
carry
on
their
quarrel
they
changed
themselves
into
two
ravens
and
fought
for
a
year
next
they
turned
into
which
tore
one
another
for
a
year
in
the
suir
and
a
year
in
the
shannon
then
they
became
human
again
and
fought
as
champions
and
ended
by
changing
into
eels
one
of
these
eels
went
into
the
river
cruind
in
cualgne
in
ulster
where
it
was
swallowed
by
a
cow
belonging
to
daire
of
cualgne
and
the
other
into
the
spring
of
uaran
garad
in
connaught
where
it
passed
into
the
belly
of
a
cow
of
queen
thus
were
born
those
two
famous
beasts
the
brown
bull
of
ulster
and
the
bull
of
connaught
now
the
was
of
such
proud
mind
that
he
scorned
to
belong
to
a
woman
and
he
went
out
of
herds
into
those
of
her
husband
ailill
so
that
when
ailill
and
medb
one
day
in
their
idleness
counted
up
their
possessions
to
set
them
off
one
against
the
other
although
they
were
equal
in
every
other
thing
in
jewels
and
clothes
and
household
vessels
in
sheep
and
horses
and
swine
and
cattle
medb
had
no
one
bull
that
was
worthy
to
be
set
beside
refusing
to
be
less
in
anything
than
her
husband
the
proud
queen
sent
heralds
with
gifts
and
compliments
to
daire
asking
him
to
lend
her
the
brown
bull
for
a
year
daire
would
have
done
so
gladly
had
not
one
of
messengers
been
heard
boasting
in
his
cups
that
if
daire
had
not
lent
the
brown
bull
of
his
own
medb
would
have
taken
it
this
was
reported
to
daire
who
at
once
swore
that
she
should
never
have
it
messenger
returned
and
the
queen
of
connaught
furious
at
his
refusal
vowed
that
she
would
take
it
by
force
she
assembled
the
armies
of
all
the
rest
of
ireland
to
go
against
ulster
and
made
fergus
son
of
roy
an
ulster
champion
who
had
quarrelled
with
king
conchobar
its
leader
they
expected
to
have
an
easy
victory
for
the
warriors
of
ulster
were
at
that
time
lying
under
a
magic
weakness
which
fell
upon
them
for
many
days
in
each
year
as
the
result
of
a
curse
laid
upon
them
long
before
by
a
goddess
who
had
been
insulted
by
one
of
ancestors
medb
called
up
a
prophetess
of
her
people
to
foretell
victory
do
you
see
our
hosts
asked
the
queen
of
the
seeress
see
crimson
on
them
i
see
red
she
replied
the
warriors
of
ulster
are
lying
in
their
sickness
nay
how
do
you
see
our
men
see
them
all
crimson
i
see
them
all
red
she
repeated
and
then
she
added
to
the
astonished
queen
who
had
expected
a
quite
different
foretelling
i
see
a
small
man
doing
deeds
of
arms
though
there
are
many
wounds
on
his
smooth
skin
the
shines
round
his
head
and
there
is
victory
on
his
forehead
he
is
richly
clothed
and
young
and
beautiful
and
modest
but
he
is
a
dragon
in
battle
his
appearance
and
his
valour
are
those
of
cuchulainn
of
muirthemne
who
that
from
muirthemne
may
be
i
do
not
know
but
i
know
this
that
all
our
army
will
be
reddened
by
him
he
is
setting
out
for
battle
he
will
hew
down
your
hosts
the
slaughter
he
shall
make
will
be
long
remembered
there
will
be
many
women
crying
over
the
bodies
mangled
by
the
hound
of
the
forge
whom
i
see
before
me
for
cuchulainn
was
for
some
reason
unknown
to
us
the
only
man
in
ulster
who
was
not
subject
to
the
magic
weakness
and
therefore
it
fell
upon
him
to
defend
ulster
against
the
whole
of
army
in
spite
of
the
injury
done
him
by
king
conchobar
fergus
still
kept
a
love
for
his
own
country
he
had
not
the
heart
to
march
upon
the
ultonians
without
first
secretly
sending
a
messenger
to
warn
them
so
that
though
all
the
other
champions
of
the
red
branch
were
helpless
cuchulainn
was
watching
the
marches
when
the
army
came
now
begins
the
story
of
the
of
the
gaelic
hero
it
is
after
the
manner
of
epics
the
record
of
a
series
of
single
combats
in
each
of
which
cuchulainn
slays
his
adversary
man
after
man
comes
against
him
and
not
one
goes
back
in
the
intervals
between
these
duels
cuchulainn
harasses
the
army
with
his
sling
slaying
a
hundred
men
a
day
he
kills
pet
dog
bird
and
squirrel
and
creates
such
terror
that
no
one
dares
to
stir
out
of
the
camp
medb
herself
has
a
narrow
escape
for
one
of
her
who
puts
on
her
golden
is
killed
by
a
stone
flung
from
sling
the
great
queen
determines
to
see
with
her
own
eyes
this
marvellous
hero
who
is
holding
all
her
warriors
at
bay
she
sends
an
envoy
asking
him
to
come
and
parley
with
her
cuchulainn
agrees
and
at
the
meeting
medb
is
amazed
at
his
boyish
look
she
finds
it
hard
to
believe
that
it
is
this
beardless
stripling
of
seventeen
who
is
killing
her
champions
until
the
whole
army
seems
as
though
it
were
melting
away
she
offers
him
her
own
friendship
and
great
honours
and
possessions
in
connaught
if
he
will
forsake
conchobar
he
refuses
but
she
offers
it
again
and
again
at
last
cuchulainn
indignantly
declares
that
the
next
man
who
comes
with
such
a
message
will
do
so
at
his
peril
one
bargain
however
he
will
make
he
is
willing
to
fight
one
of
the
men
of
ireland
every
day
and
while
the
duel
lasts
the
main
army
may
march
on
but
as
soon
as
cuchulainn
has
killed
his
man
it
must
halt
until
the
next
day
medb
agrees
to
this
thinking
it
better
to
lose
one
man
a
day
than
a
hundred
medb
makes
the
same
offer
to
every
famous
warrior
to
induce
him
to
go
against
cuchulainn
the
reward
for
the
head
of
the
champion
will
be
the
hand
of
her
daughter
findabair
in
spite
of
this
not
one
of
the
aspirants
to
the
princess
can
stand
before
cuchulainn
all
perish
and
findabair
when
she
finds
out
how
she
is
being
promised
to
a
fresh
suitor
every
day
dies
of
shame
but
while
cuchulainn
is
engaged
in
these
combats
medb
sends
men
who
scour
ulster
for
the
brown
bull
and
find
him
and
drive
him
with
fifty
heifers
into
her
camp
meanwhile
the
æs
sídhe
the
fairy
are
watching
the
hero
amazed
at
his
achievements
his
exploits
kindle
love
in
the
fierce
heart
of
the
morrígú
the
great
cuchulainn
is
awakened
from
sleep
by
a
terrible
shout
from
the
north
he
orders
his
driver
laeg
to
yoke
the
horses
to
his
chariot
so
that
he
may
find
out
who
raised
it
they
go
in
the
direction
from
which
the
sound
had
come
and
meet
with
a
woman
in
a
chariot
drawn
by
a
red
horse
she
has
red
eyebrows
and
a
red
dress
and
a
long
red
cloak
and
she
carries
a
great
gray
spear
he
asks
her
who
she
is
and
she
tells
him
that
she
is
a
daughter
and
that
she
has
fallen
in
love
with
him
through
hearing
of
his
exploits
cuchulainn
says
that
he
has
other
things
to
think
of
than
love
she
replies
that
she
has
been
giving
him
her
help
in
his
battles
and
will
still
do
so
and
cuchulainn
answers
that
he
does
not
need
any
help
says
she
you
will
not
have
my
love
and
help
you
shall
have
my
hatred
and
enmity
when
you
are
fighting
with
a
warrior
as
good
as
yourself
i
will
come
against
you
in
various
shapes
and
hinder
you
so
that
he
shall
have
the
cuchulainn
draws
his
sword
but
all
he
sees
is
a
hoodie
crow
sitting
on
a
branch
he
knows
from
this
that
the
red
woman
in
the
chariot
was
the
great
queen
of
the
gods
the
next
day
a
warrior
named
loch
went
to
meet
cuchulainn
at
first
he
refused
to
fight
one
who
was
beardless
so
cuchulainn
smeared
his
chin
with
blackberry
juice
until
it
looked
as
though
he
had
a
beard
while
cuchulainn
was
fighting
loch
the
morrígú
came
against
him
three
as
a
heifer
which
tried
to
overthrow
him
and
next
as
an
eel
which
got
beneath
his
feet
as
he
stood
in
running
water
and
then
as
a
wolf
which
seized
hold
of
his
right
arm
but
cuchulainn
broke
the
leg
and
trampled
upon
the
eel
and
put
out
one
of
the
eyes
though
every
one
of
these
three
times
loch
wounded
him
in
the
end
cuchulainn
slew
loch
with
his
invincible
spear
the
made
of
a
bones
the
morrígú
came
back
to
cuchulainn
disguised
as
an
old
woman
to
have
her
wounds
healed
by
him
for
no
one
could
cure
them
but
he
who
had
made
them
she
became
his
friend
after
this
and
helped
him
but
the
fighting
was
so
continuous
that
cuchulainn
got
no
sleep
except
just
for
a
while
from
time
to
time
when
he
might
rest
a
little
with
his
head
on
his
hand
and
his
hand
on
his
spear
and
his
spear
on
his
knee
so
that
his
father
lugh
the
took
pity
on
him
and
came
to
him
in
the
semblance
of
a
tall
handsome
man
in
a
green
cloak
and
a
silk
shirt
and
carrying
a
black
shield
and
a
spear
he
put
him
into
a
sleep
of
three
days
and
three
nights
and
while
he
rested
he
laid
druidical
herbs
on
to
all
his
wounds
so
that
in
the
end
he
rose
up
again
completely
healed
and
as
strong
as
at
the
very
beginning
of
the
war
while
he
was
asleep
the
of
emain
macha
old
companions
came
and
fought
instead
of
him
and
slew
three
times
their
own
number
but
were
all
killed
it
was
at
this
time
that
medb
asked
fergus
to
go
and
fight
with
cuchulainn
fergus
answered
that
he
would
never
fight
against
his
own
medb
asked
him
again
and
again
and
at
last
he
went
but
without
his
famous
sword
my
guardian
said
cuchulainn
is
not
safe
for
you
to
come
out
against
me
without
your
i
had
the
sword
replied
fergus
would
not
use
it
on
then
fergus
asked
cuchulainn
for
the
sake
of
all
he
had
done
for
him
in
his
to
pretend
to
fight
with
him
and
then
give
way
before
him
and
run
away
cuchulainn
answered
that
he
was
very
loth
to
be
seen
running
from
any
man
but
fergus
promised
cuchulainn
that
if
cuchulainn
would
run
away
from
fergus
then
fergus
would
run
away
from
cuchulainn
at
some
future
time
whenever
cuchulainn
wished
cuchulainn
agreed
to
this
for
he
knew
that
it
would
be
for
the
profit
of
ulster
so
they
fought
a
little
and
then
cuchulainn
turned
and
fled
in
the
sight
of
all
army
fergus
went
back
and
medb
could
not
reproach
him
any
more
but
she
cast
about
to
find
some
other
way
of
vanquishing
cuchulainn
the
agreement
made
had
been
that
only
one
man
a
day
should
be
sent
against
him
but
now
medb
sent
the
wizard
calatin
with
his
sons
and
his
grandson
all
at
once
for
she
said
are
really
only
one
for
they
are
all
from
they
never
missed
a
throw
with
their
poisoned
spears
and
every
man
they
hit
died
either
on
the
spot
or
within
the
week
when
fergus
heard
of
this
he
was
in
great
grief
and
he
sent
a
man
called
fiacha
an
exile
like
himself
from
ulster
to
watch
the
fight
and
report
how
it
went
now
fiacha
did
not
mean
to
join
in
it
but
when
he
saw
cuchulainn
assailed
by
at
a
time
and
overpowered
he
could
not
restrain
himself
so
he
drew
his
sword
and
helped
cuchulainn
and
between
them
they
killed
calatin
and
his
whole
family
as
a
last
resource
now
medb
sent
for
ferdiad
who
was
the
great
champion
of
the
iberian
of
who
had
thrown
in
their
lot
with
medb
in
the
war
for
the
brown
bull
ferdiad
had
been
a
companion
and
of
cuchulainn
with
scathach
and
he
did
not
wish
to
fight
with
him
but
medb
told
him
that
if
he
refused
her
satirists
should
make
such
lampoons
on
him
that
he
would
die
of
shame
and
his
name
would
be
a
reproach
for
ever
she
also
offered
him
great
rewards
and
honours
and
bound
herself
in
six
sureties
to
keep
her
promises
at
last
reluctantly
he
went
cuchulainn
saw
him
coming
and
went
out
to
welcome
him
but
ferdiad
said
that
he
had
not
come
as
a
friend
but
to
fight
now
cuchulainn
had
been
junior
and
in
island
and
he
begged
him
by
the
memory
of
those
old
times
to
go
back
but
ferdiad
said
he
could
not
they
fought
all
day
and
neither
had
gained
any
advantage
by
sunset
so
they
kissed
one
another
and
each
went
back
to
his
camp
ferdiad
sent
half
his
food
and
drink
to
cuchulainn
and
cuchulainn
sent
half
his
healing
herbs
and
medicines
to
ferdiad
and
their
horses
were
put
in
the
same
stable
and
their
charioteers
slept
by
the
same
fire
and
so
it
happened
on
the
second
day
but
at
the
end
of
the
third
day
they
parted
gloomily
knowing
that
on
the
morrow
one
of
them
must
fall
and
their
horses
were
not
put
in
the
same
stall
that
night
neither
did
their
charioteers
sleep
at
the
same
fire
on
the
fourth
day
cuchulainn
succeeded
in
killing
ferdiad
by
casting
the
at
him
from
underneath
but
when
he
saw
that
he
was
dying
the
passed
away
and
he
took
his
old
companion
up
in
his
arms
and
carried
him
across
the
river
on
whose
banks
they
had
fought
so
that
he
might
be
with
the
men
of
ulster
in
his
death
and
not
with
the
men
of
ireland
and
he
wept
over
him
and
said
was
all
a
game
and
a
sport
until
ferdiad
came
oh
ferdiad
your
death
will
hang
over
me
like
a
cloud
for
ever
yesterday
he
was
greater
than
a
mountain
he
is
less
than
a
by
this
time
cuchulainn
was
so
covered
with
wounds
that
he
could
not
bear
his
clothes
to
touch
his
skin
but
had
to
hold
them
off
with
and
fill
the
spaces
in
between
with
grass
there
was
not
a
place
on
him
the
size
of
a
that
had
not
a
wound
on
it
except
his
left
hand
which
held
the
shield
but
sualtam
reputed
father
had
learned
what
a
sore
plight
his
son
was
in
i
hear
the
heaven
bursting
or
the
sea
running
away
or
the
earth
breaking
open
he
cried
is
it
my
groaning
that
i
hear
he
came
to
look
for
him
and
found
him
covered
with
wounds
and
blood
but
cuchulainn
would
not
let
his
father
either
weep
for
him
or
try
to
avenge
him
rather
he
said
to
him
emain
macha
and
tell
conchobar
that
i
can
no
longer
defend
ulster
against
all
the
four
provinces
of
erin
without
help
tell
him
that
there
is
no
part
of
my
body
on
which
there
is
not
a
wound
and
that
if
he
wishes
to
save
his
kingdom
he
must
make
no
sualtam
mounted
the
of
and
galloped
to
emain
macha
three
times
he
shouted
are
being
killed
women
carried
off
and
cattle
lifted
in
twice
he
met
with
no
response
the
third
time
cathbad
the
druid
roused
himself
from
his
lethargy
to
denounce
the
man
who
was
disturbing
the
sleep
in
his
indignation
sualtam
turned
away
so
sharply
that
the
gray
steed
reared
and
struck
its
shield
against
his
neck
with
such
force
that
he
was
decapitated
the
startled
horse
then
turned
back
into
stronghold
and
dashed
through
it
severed
head
continuing
to
cry
out
are
being
killed
women
carried
off
and
cattle
lifted
in
such
a
portent
was
enough
to
rouse
the
most
drowsy
conchobar
himself
again
swore
a
great
oath
heavens
are
over
us
the
earth
is
beneath
us
and
the
sea
circles
us
round
and
unless
the
heavens
fall
with
all
their
stars
or
the
earth
gives
way
beneath
us
or
the
sea
bursts
over
the
land
i
will
restore
every
cow
to
her
stable
and
every
woman
to
her
he
sent
messengers
to
rally
ulster
and
they
gathered
and
marched
on
the
men
of
erin
and
then
was
fought
such
a
battle
as
had
never
been
before
in
ireland
first
one
side
then
the
other
gave
way
and
rallied
again
until
cuchulainn
heard
the
noise
of
the
fight
and
rose
up
in
spite
of
all
his
wounds
and
came
to
it
he
called
out
to
fergus
reminding
him
how
he
had
bound
himself
with
an
oath
to
run
from
him
when
called
upon
to
do
so
so
fergus
ran
before
cuchulainn
and
when
army
saw
their
leader
running
they
broke
and
fled
like
one
man
but
the
brown
bull
of
cualgne
went
with
the
army
into
connaught
and
there
he
met
bull
the
and
he
fought
the
and
tore
him
limb
from
limb
and
carried
off
pieces
of
him
on
his
horns
dropping
the
loins
at
athlone
and
the
liver
at
trim
then
he
went
back
to
cualgne
and
turned
mad
killing
all
who
crossed
his
path
until
his
heart
burst
with
bellowing
and
he
fell
dead
this
was
the
end
of
the
great
war
called
bó
the
of
the
cattle
of
yet
wondrous
as
it
was
it
was
not
the
most
marvellous
of
exploits
like
all
the
solar
gods
and
heroes
of
celtic
myth
he
carried
his
conquests
into
the
dark
region
of
hades
on
this
occasion
the
mysterious
realm
is
an
island
called
that
is
the
and
though
its
king
is
not
mentioned
by
name
it
seems
likely
that
he
was
mider
and
that
dún
scaith
is
another
name
for
the
isle
of
falga
or
man
the
story
as
a
poem
relates
it
is
curiously
suggestive
of
a
raid
which
the
powers
of
light
and
especially
the
are
represented
as
having
made
upon
hades
in
kindred
british
myth
the
same
loathsome
combatants
issue
out
of
the
underworld
to
repel
its
assailants
there
was
a
pit
in
the
centre
of
dún
scaith
out
of
which
swarmed
a
vast
throng
of
serpents
no
sooner
had
cuchulainn
and
the
heroes
of
ulster
disposed
of
these
than
house
full
of
was
loosed
upon
beaked
says
the
poem
which
caught
them
by
the
noses
and
these
were
in
turn
replaced
by
fierce
dragons
yet
the
heroes
prevailed
and
carried
off
the
cows
of
magic
qualities
and
a
marvellous
cauldron
in
which
was
always
found
an
inexhaustible
supply
of
meat
with
treasure
of
silver
and
gold
to
boot
they
started
back
for
ireland
in
a
coracle
the
three
cows
being
towed
behind
with
the
treasure
in
bags
around
their
necks
but
the
gods
of
hades
raised
a
storm
which
wrecked
their
ship
and
they
had
to
swim
home
here
more
than
mortal
prowess
came
in
useful
we
are
told
that
he
floated
nine
men
to
shore
on
each
of
his
hands
and
thirty
on
his
head
while
eight
more
clinging
to
his
sides
used
him
as
a
kind
of
after
this
came
the
tragedy
of
career
the
unhappy
duel
in
which
he
killed
his
only
son
not
knowing
who
he
was
the
story
is
one
common
apparently
to
the
aryan
nations
for
it
is
found
not
only
in
the
gaelic
but
in
the
teutonic
and
persian
mythic
traditions
it
will
be
remembered
that
cuchulainn
defeated
a
rival
of
scathach
the
amazon
named
aoife
and
compelled
her
to
render
submission
the
hero
had
also
a
son
by
aoife
and
he
asked
that
the
boy
should
be
called
conlaoch
and
that
when
he
was
of
age
to
travel
he
should
be
sent
to
ireland
to
find
his
father
aoife
promised
this
but
a
little
later
news
came
to
her
that
cuchulainn
had
married
emer
mad
with
jealousy
she
determined
to
make
the
son
avenge
her
slight
upon
the
father
she
taught
him
the
craft
of
arms
until
there
was
no
more
that
he
could
learn
and
sent
him
to
ireland
before
he
started
she
laid
three
upon
him
the
first
was
that
he
was
not
to
turn
back
the
second
that
he
was
never
to
refuse
a
challenge
and
the
third
that
he
was
never
to
tell
his
name
he
arrived
at
dundealgan
home
and
the
warrior
conall
came
down
to
meet
him
and
asked
him
his
name
and
lineage
he
refused
to
tell
them
and
this
led
to
a
duel
in
which
conall
was
disarmed
and
humiliated
cuchulainn
next
approached
him
asked
the
same
question
and
received
the
same
answer
if
i
was
not
under
a
command
said
conlaoch
who
did
not
know
he
was
speaking
to
his
father
is
no
man
in
the
world
to
whom
i
would
sooner
tell
it
than
to
yourself
for
i
love
your
even
this
compliment
could
not
stave
off
the
fight
for
cuchulainn
felt
it
his
duty
to
punish
the
insolence
of
this
stripling
who
refused
to
declare
who
he
was
the
fight
was
a
fierce
one
and
the
invincible
cuchulainn
found
himself
so
pressed
that
the
shone
round
him
and
transfigured
his
face
when
conlaoch
saw
this
he
knew
who
his
antagonist
must
be
and
purposely
flung
his
spear
slantways
that
it
might
not
hit
his
father
but
before
cuchulainn
understood
he
had
thrown
the
terrible
conlaoch
dying
declared
his
name
and
so
passionate
was
grief
that
the
men
of
ulster
were
afraid
that
in
his
madness
he
might
wreak
his
wrath
upon
them
they
therefore
called
upon
cathbad
the
druid
to
put
him
under
a
glamour
cathbad
turned
the
waves
of
the
sea
into
the
appearance
of
armed
men
and
cuchulainn
smote
them
with
his
sword
until
he
fell
prone
from
weariness
it
would
take
too
long
to
relate
all
the
other
adventures
and
exploits
of
cuchulainn
enough
has
been
done
if
any
reader
of
this
chapter
should
be
persuaded
by
it
to
study
the
wonderful
saga
of
ancient
ireland
for
himself
we
must
pass
on
quickly
to
its
tragical
death
medb
queen
of
connaught
had
never
forgiven
him
for
keeping
back
her
army
from
raiding
ulster
and
for
slaying
so
many
of
her
friends
and
allies
so
she
went
secretly
to
all
those
whose
relations
cuchulainn
had
killed
and
they
were
many
and
stirred
them
up
to
revenge
besides
this
she
had
sent
the
three
daughters
of
calatin
the
wizard
born
after
their
death
at
the
hands
of
cuchulainn
to
alba
and
to
babylon
to
learn
witchcraft
when
they
came
back
they
were
mistresses
of
every
kind
of
sorcery
and
could
make
the
illusion
of
battle
with
an
incantation
and
lest
she
might
fail
even
then
she
waited
with
patience
until
the
ultonians
were
again
in
their
magic
weakness
and
there
was
no
one
to
help
cuchulainn
but
himself
lugaid
son
of
the
curoi
king
of
munster
whom
cuchulainn
had
killed
for
the
sake
of
blathnat
daughter
gathered
the
munster
men
erc
whose
father
had
also
fallen
at
hands
called
the
men
of
meath
the
king
of
leinster
brought
out
his
army
and
with
ailill
and
medb
and
all
connaught
they
marched
into
ulster
again
and
began
to
ravage
it
conchobar
called
his
warriors
and
druids
into
council
to
see
if
they
could
find
some
means
of
putting
off
war
until
they
were
ready
to
meet
it
he
did
not
wish
cuchulainn
to
go
out
a
second
time
against
all
the
rest
of
ireland
for
he
knew
that
if
the
champion
perished
the
prosperity
of
ulster
would
fall
with
him
for
ever
so
when
cuchulainn
came
to
emain
macha
the
king
set
all
the
ladies
singers
and
poets
of
the
court
to
keep
his
thoughts
from
war
until
the
men
of
ulster
had
recovered
from
their
weakness
but
while
they
sat
feasting
and
talking
in
the
the
three
daughters
of
calatin
came
fluttering
down
on
to
the
lawn
before
it
and
began
gathering
grass
and
thistles
and
and
withered
leaves
and
turning
them
into
the
semblance
of
armies
and
by
the
same
magic
they
caused
shouts
and
shrieks
and
and
the
clattering
of
arms
to
be
heard
all
round
the
house
as
though
a
battle
were
being
fought
cuchulainn
leaped
up
red
with
shame
to
think
that
fighting
should
be
going
on
without
his
help
and
seized
his
sword
but
son
caught
him
by
the
arms
all
the
druids
explained
to
him
that
what
he
saw
was
only
an
enchantment
raised
by
the
children
of
calatin
to
draw
him
out
to
his
death
but
it
was
as
much
as
all
of
them
could
do
to
keep
him
quiet
while
he
saw
the
phantom
armies
and
heard
the
magic
sounds
so
they
decided
that
it
would
be
well
to
remove
cuchulainn
from
emain
macha
to
the
until
all
the
enchantments
of
the
daughters
of
calatin
were
spent
it
was
the
quality
of
this
valley
that
if
all
the
men
of
ireland
were
to
shout
round
it
at
once
no
one
within
it
would
hear
a
sound
but
the
daughters
of
calatin
went
there
too
and
again
they
took
thistles
and
and
withered
leaves
and
put
on
them
the
appearance
of
armed
men
so
that
there
seemed
to
be
no
place
outside
the
whole
valley
that
was
not
filled
with
shouting
battalions
and
they
made
the
illusion
of
fires
all
around
and
the
sound
of
women
shrieking
everyone
who
heard
that
outcry
was
frightened
at
it
not
only
the
men
and
women
but
even
the
dogs
though
the
women
and
the
druids
shouted
back
with
all
the
strength
of
their
voices
to
drown
it
they
could
not
keep
cuchulainn
from
hearing
he
cried
hear
the
men
of
ireland
shouting
as
they
ravage
the
province
my
triumph
is
at
an
end
my
fame
is
gone
ulster
lies
low
for
it
pass
said
cathbad
is
only
the
idle
magic
noises
made
by
the
children
of
calatin
who
want
to
draw
you
out
to
put
an
end
to
you
stay
here
with
us
and
take
no
heed
of
cuchulainn
obeyed
and
the
daughters
of
calatin
went
on
for
a
long
time
filling
the
air
with
noises
of
battle
but
they
grew
tired
of
it
at
last
for
they
saw
that
the
druids
and
women
had
outwitted
them
they
did
not
succeed
until
one
of
them
took
the
form
of
a
leman
of
and
came
to
him
crying
out
that
dundealgan
was
burnt
and
muirthemne
ruined
and
the
whole
province
of
ulster
ravaged
then
at
last
he
was
deceived
and
took
his
arms
and
armour
and
in
spite
of
all
that
was
said
to
him
he
ordered
laeg
to
yoke
his
chariot
signs
and
portents
now
began
to
gather
as
thickly
round
the
doomed
hero
as
they
did
round
the
wooers
in
the
hall
of
odysseus
his
famous
the
gray
of
macha
refused
to
be
bridled
and
shed
large
tears
of
blood
his
mother
dechtiré
brought
him
a
goblet
full
of
wine
and
thrice
the
wine
turned
into
blood
as
he
put
it
to
his
lips
at
the
first
ford
he
crossed
he
saw
a
maiden
of
the
washing
clothes
and
armour
and
she
told
him
that
it
was
the
clothes
and
arms
of
cuchulainn
who
was
soon
to
be
dead
he
met
three
ancient
hags
cooking
a
hound
on
spits
of
rowan
and
they
invited
him
to
partake
of
it
he
refused
for
it
was
taboo
to
him
to
eat
the
flesh
of
his
namesake
but
they
shamed
him
into
doing
so
by
telling
him
that
he
ate
at
rich
tables
and
refused
the
hospitality
of
the
poor
the
forbidden
meat
paralysed
half
his
body
then
he
saw
his
enemies
coming
up
against
him
in
their
chariots
cuchulainn
had
three
spears
of
which
it
was
prophesied
that
each
should
kill
a
king
three
druids
were
charged
in
turn
to
ask
for
these
spears
for
it
was
not
thought
lucky
to
refuse
anything
to
a
druid
the
first
one
came
up
to
where
cuchulainn
was
making
the
plain
red
with
slaughter
me
one
of
those
spears
he
said
i
will
lampoon
it
replied
cuchulainn
have
never
yet

and
killed
him
but
lugaid
threw
it
back
and
it
went
through

and
wounded
him
to
the
death
then
in
his
agony
he
greatly
desired
to

he
asked
his
enemies
to
let

go
to

lay
close

quench

come

said

they
let
him

cuchulainn
drank
and
bathed
and
came
out
of
the
water
but
he
found
that
he
could
not
walk
so
he
called
to
his
enemies
to
come
to
him
there
was
a
near
and
he
bound
himself
to
it
with
his
belt
so
that
he
might
die

up

not
lying
down

dying

the

came
back
to
fight
for
him

killed
fifty
men
with
his
teeth

thirty

after
so
fine
a

cuchulainn
could
not

armed

me
before
the

all
honourable
people
i
came
under
your
shelter
trusting
in
your
faithfulness
and
now
you
seek
a
cause
of
quarrel
with
but
cuchulainn
could
not
understand
why
his
wife
should
not
be
content
to
take
her
turn
with
this
other
no
unworthy
rival
for
she
was
beautiful
and
came
of
the
lofty
race
of
gods
we
see
emer
yield
at
last
with
queenly
pathos
will
not
refuse
this
woman
to
you
if
you
long
for
her
she
said
i
know
that
everything
that
is
new
seems
fair
and
everything
that
is
common
seems
bitter
and
everything
we
have
not
seems
desirable
to
us
and
everything
we
have
we
think
little
of
and
yet
cuchulainn
i
was
once
pleasing
to
you
and
i
would
wish
to
be
so
her
grief
touched
him
my
word
he
said
are
pleasing
to
me
and
will
be
as
long
as
i
let
me
be
given
up
said
fand
is
better
that
i
should
be
replied
emer
said
fand
is
i
who
must
be
given
up
in
the
end
is
i
who
will
go
though
i
go
with
great
sorrow
i
would
rather
stay
with
cuchulainn
than
live
in
the
sunny
home
of
the
gods
emer
he
is
yours
and
you
are
worthy
of
him
what
my
hand
can
not
have
my
heart
may
yet
wish
well
to
sorrowful
thing
it
is
to
love
without
return
better
to
renounce
than
not
to
receive
a
love
equal
to
own
was
not
well
of
you
o
emer
to
come
to
kill
fand
in
her
it
was
while
the
goddess
and
the
human
woman
were
contending
with
one
another
in
that
manannán
son
of
the
sea
heard
of
trouble
and
was
sorry
that
he
had
forsaken
her
so
he
came
invisible
to
all
but
her
alone
he
asked
her
pardon
and
she
herself
could
not
forget
that
she
had
once
been
happy
with
the
of
the
crested
and
still
might
be
happy
with
him
again
the
god
asked
her
to
make
her
choice
between
them
and
when
she
went
to
him
he
shook
his
mantle
between
her
and
cuchulainn
it
was
one
of
the
magic
properties
of
mantle
that
those
between
whom
it
was
shaken
could
never
meet
again
then
fand
returned
with
her
divine
husband
to
the
country
of
the
immortals
and
the
druids
of
emain
macha
gave
cuchulainn
and
emer
each
a
drink
of
oblivion
so
that
cuchulainn
forgot
his
love
and
emer
her
jealousy
the
scene
of
this
story
takes
its
name
from
another
and
hardly
less
beautiful

they
parted
however
but
by
the
craft
of

ghostly
enemy
they
had
appointed
to
meet
one
another
at
dundealgan
and
baile
who
arrived
there
first
was
greeted
by
a
stranger
news
do
you
bring
asked
baile
replied
the
stranger
that
ailinn
of
leinster
was
setting
out
to
meet
her
lover
but
the
men
of
leinster
kept
her
back
and
her
heart
broke
then
and
there
from
when
baile
heard
this
his
own
heart
broke
and
he
fell
dead
on
the
strand
while
the
messenger
went
on
the
wings
of
the
wind
to
the
home
of
ailinn
who
had
not
yet
started
come
you
she
asked
him
ulster
by
the
shore
of
dundealgan
where
i
saw
men
raising
a
stone
over
one
who
had
just
died
and
on
the
stone
i
read
the
name
of
baile
he
had
come
to
meet
some
woman
he
was
in
love
with
but
it
was
destined
that
they
should
never
see
one
another
again
in
at
this
news
ailinn
too
fell
dead
and
was
buried
and
we
are
told
that
an
grew
out
of
her
grave
the
apples
of
which
bore
the
likeness
of
the
face
of
baile
while
a
sprung
from
grave
and
took
the
appearance
of
ailinn
this
legend
which
is
probably
a
part
of
the
common
heritage
of
the
aryans
is
found
in
over
an
area
which
stretches
from
ireland
to
india
the
gaelic
version
has
however
an
ending
unknown
to
the
others
the
two
trees
it
relates
were
cut
down
and
made
into
wands
upon
which
the
poets
of
ulster
and
of
leinster
cut
the
songs
of
the
of
their
two
provinces
in
but
even
these
mute
memorials
of
baile
and
ailinn
were
destined
not
to
be
divided
after
two
hundred
years
art
the
of
ireland
ordered
them
to
be
brought
to
the
hall
of
tara
and
as
soon
as
the
wands
found
themselves
under
the
same
roof
they
all
sprang
together
and
no
force
or
skill
could
part
them
again
so
the
king
commanded
them
to
be
like
any
other
jewel
in
the
treasury
of
neither
of
these
stories
however
has
as
yet
attained
the
fame
of
one
now
to
be
retold
to
many
no
doubt
gaelic
romance
is
summed
up
in
the
one
word
deirdre
it
is
the
legend
of
this
gaelic
helen
that
the
poets
of
the
modern
celtic
school
most
love
to
elaborate
while
old
men
still
tell
it
round
the
of
ireland
and
the
highlands
scholar
and
peasant
alike
combine
to
preserve
a
tradition
no
one
knows
how
many
hundred
years
old
for
it
was
written
down
in
the
book
of
leinster
as
one
of
the
which
every
bard
was
bound
to
be
able
to
recite
it
takes
rank
with
the
of
the
sons
of
and
with
the
of
the
children
of
as
one
of
the
sorrowful
stories
of
so
favourite
a
tale
has
naturally
been
much
altered
and
added
to
in
its
passage
down
the
generations
but
its
essential
story
is
as
follows
king
conchobar
of
ulster
was
holding
festival
in
the
house
of
one
of
his
bards
called
fedlimid
when
wife
gave
birth
to
a
daughter
concerning
whom
cathbad
the
druid
uttered
a
prophecy
he
foretold
that
the
child
would
grow
up
to
be
the
most
lovely
woman
the
world
had
ever
seen
but
that
her
beauty
would
bring
death
to
many
heroes
and
much
peril
and
sorrow
to
ulster
on
hearing
this
the
red
branch
warriors
demanded
that
she
should
be
killed
but
conchobar
refused
and
gave
the
infant
to
a
trusted
to
be
hidden
in
a
secret
place
in
the
solitude
of
the
mountains
until
she
was
of
an
age
to
be
his
own
wife
so
deirdre
as
cathbad
named
her
was
taken
away
to
a
hut
so
remote
from
the
paths
of
men
that
none
knew
of
it
save
conchobar
here
she
was
brought
up
by
a
nurse
a
fosterer
and
a
teacher
and
saw
no
other
living
creatures
save
the
beasts
and
birds
of
the
hills
nevertheless
she
aspired
to
be
loved
one
day
her
fosterer
was
killing
a
calf
for
their
food
and
its
blood
ran
out
upon
the
snowy
ground
which
brought
a
black
raven
swooping
to
the
spot
there
were
a
man
said
deirdre
had
hair
of
the
blackness
of
that
raven
skin
of
the
whiteness
of
the
snow
and
cheeks
as
red
as
the
blood
that
is
the
man
whom
i
would
wish
to
marry
there
is
such
a
man
replied
her
teacher
thoughtlessly
one
of
the
sons
of
usnach
heroes
of
the
same
race
as
conchobar
the
the
curious
deirdre
prevailed
upon
her
teacher
to
bring
naoise
to
speak
with
her
when
they
met
she
made
good
use
of
her
time
for
she
offered
naoise
her
love
and
begged
him
to
take
her
away
from
king
conchobar
naoise
bewitched
by
her
beauty
consented
accompanied
by
his
two
brothers
ardan
and
ainle
and
their
followers
he
fled
with
deirdre
to
alba
where
they
made
alliance
with
one
of
its
kings
and
wandered
over
the
land
living
by
following
the
deer
and
by
helping
the
king
in
his
battles
the
revengeful
conchobar
bided
his
time
one
day
as
the
heroes
of
the
red
branch
feasted
together
at
emain
macha
he
asked
them
if
they
had
ever
heard
of
a
nobler
company
than
their
own
they
replied
that
the
world
could
not
hold
such
another
said
the
king
lack
our
full
tale
the
three
sons
of
usnach
could
defend
the
province
of
ulster
against
any
other
province
of
ireland
by
themselves
and
it
is
a
pity
that
they
should
still
be
exiles
for
the
sake
of
any
woman
in
the
world
gladly
would
i
welcome
them
back
ourselves
replied
the
ultonians
have
counselled
this
long
ago
had
we
dared
o
king
i
will
send
one
of
my
three
best
champions
to
fetch
them
said
conchobar
conall
the
victorious
or
cuchulainn
the
son
of
sualtam
or
fergus
the
son
of
roy
and
i
will
find
out
which
of
those
three
loves
me
first
he
called
conall
to
him
secretly
would
you
do
o
conall
he
asked
you
were
sent
to
fetch
the
sons
of
usnach
and
they
were
killed
here
in
spite
of
your
is
not
a
man
in
ulster
answered
conall
had
hand
in
it
that
would
escape
his
own
death
from
see
that
i
am
not
dearest
of
all
men
to
you
replied
conchobar
and
dismissing
conall
he
called
cuchulainn
and
put
the
same
question
to
him
my
sworn
word
replied
cuchulainn
such
a
thing
happened
with
your
consent
no
bribe
or
would
i
accept
in
lieu
of
your
own
head
o
said
the
king
is
not
you
i
will
the
king
then
asked
fergus
and
he
replied
that
if
the
sons
of
usnach
were
slain
while
under
his
protection
he
would
revenge
the
deed
upon
anyone
who
was
party
to
it
save
only
the
king
himself
it
is
you
who
shall
go
said
conchobar
forth
and
rest
not
by
the
way
and
when
you
put
foot
again
in
ireland
at
the
of
borrach
whatever
may
happen
to
you
yourself
send
the
sons
of
usnach
forward
without
the
next
morning
fergus
with
his
two
sons
illann
the
fair
and
buinne
the
ruthless
red
set
out
for
alba
in
their
galley
and
reached
loch
etive
by
whose
shores
the
sons
of
usnach
were
then
living
naoise
ainle
and
ardan
were
sitting
at
chess
when
they
heard
shout
is
the
cry
of
a
man
of
erin
said
naoise
replied
deirdre
who
had
forebodings
of
trouble
not
heed
it
it
is
only
the
shout
of
a
man
of
but
the
sons
of
usnach
knew
better
and
sent
ardan
down
to
the
where
he
found
fergus
and
his
sons
and
gave
them
greeting
and
heard
their
message
and
brought
them
back
with
him
that
night
fergus
persuaded
the
sons
of
usnach
to
return
with
him
to
emain
macha
deirdre
with
her
implored
them
to
remain
in
alba
but
the
exiles
were
weary
for
the
sight
of
their
own
country
and
did
not
share
their
fears
as
they
put
out
to
sea
deirdre
uttered
her
beautiful
to
that
land
she
was
never
to
behold
again
lovable
land

the

to
me
with

in
the
region
of

láid
often
i
slept
there
under

the

its

from

had
i
not
come
with
my
they
crossed
the
sea
and
arrived
at
the
of
borrach
who
bade
them
welcome
to
ireland
now
king
conchobar
had
sent
borrach
a
secret
command
that
he
should
offer
a
feast
to
fergus
on
his
landing
strange
taboos
called
are
laid
upon
the
various
heroes
of
ancient
ireland
in
the
stories
there
are
certain
things
that
each
one
of
them
may
not
do
without
forfeiting
life
or
honour
and
it
was
a
upon
fergus
to
refuse
a
feast
fergus
we
are
told
with
anger
from
crown
to
at
the
invitation
yet
he
could
not
avoid
the
feast
he
asked
naoise
what
he
should
do
and
deirdre
broke
in
with
what
is
asked
of
you
if
you
prefer
to
forsake
the
sons
of
usnach
for
a
feast
yet
forsaking
them
is
a
good
price
to
pay
for
fergus
however
perceived
a
possible
compromise
though
he
himself
could
not
refuse
to
stop
to
partake
of
hospitality
he
could
send
deirdre
and
the
sons
of
usnach
on
to
emain
macha
at
once
under
the
safeguard
of
his
two
sons
illann
the
fair
and
buinne
the
ruthless
red
so
this
was
done
albeit
to
the
annoyance
of
the
sons
of
usnach
and
the
terror
of
deirdre
visions
came
to
the
sorrowful
woman
she
saw
the
three
sons
of
usnach
and
illann
the
son
of
fergus
without
their
heads
she
saw
a
cloud
of
blood
always
hanging
over
them
she
begged
them
to
wait
in
some
safe
place
until
fergus
had
finished
the
feast
but
naoise
ainle
and
ardan
laughed
at
her
fears
they
arrived
at
emain
macha
and
conchobar
ordered
the
palace
to
be
placed
at
their
disposal
in
the
evening
conchobar
called
levarcham
old
teacher
to
him
he
said
the
and
see
deirdre
and
bring
me
back
news
of
her
appearance
whether
she
still
keeps
her
former
beauty
or
whether
it
has
left
so
levarcham
came
to
the
and
kissed
deirdre
and
the
three
sons
of
usnach
and
warned
them
that
conchobar
was
preparing
treachery
then
she
went
back
to
the
king
and
reported
to
him
that
hard
life
upon
the
mountains
of
alba
had
ruined
her
form
and
face
so
that
she
was
no
longer
worthy
of
his
regard
at
this
jealousy
was
partly
allayed
and
he
began
to
doubt
whether
it
would
be
wise
to
attack
the
sons
of
usnach
but
later
on
when
he
had
drunk
well
of
wine
he
sent
a
second
messenger
to
see
if
what
levarcham
had
reported
about
deirdre
was
truth
the
messenger
this
time
a
man
went
and
looked
in
through
a
window
deirdre
saw
him
and
pointed
him
out
to
naoise
who
flung
a
chessman
at
the
peering
face
and
put
out
one
of
its
eyes
but
the
man
went
back
to
conchobar
and
told
him
that
though
one
of
his
eyes
had
been
struck
out
he
would
gladly
have
stayed
looking
with
the
other
so
great
was
loveliness
then
conchobar
in
his
wrath
ordered
the
men
of
ulster
to
set
fire
to
the
red
branch
house
and
slay
all
within
it
except
deirdre
they
flung
upon
it
but
buinne
the
ruthless
red
came
out
and
quenched
them
and
drove
the
assailants
back
with
slaughter
but
conchobar
called
to
him
to
parley
and
offered
him
a
of
land
and
his
friendship
to
desert
the
sons
of
usnach
buinne
was
tempted
and
fell
but
the
land
given
him
turned
barren
that
very
night
in
indignation
at
being
owned
by
such
a
traitor
the
other
of
sons
was
of
different
make
he
charged
out
torch
in
hand
and
cut
down
the
ultonians
so
that
they
hesitated
to
come
near
the
house
again
conchobar
dared
not
offer
him
a
bribe
but
he
armed
his
own
son
fiacha
with
his
own
magic
weapons
including
his
shield
the
which
roared
when
its
owner
was
in
danger
and
sent
him
to
fight
illann
the
duel
was
a
fierce
one
and
illann
got
the
better
of
fiacha
so
that
the
son
of
conchobar
had
to
crouch
down
beneath
his
shield
which
roared
for
help
conall
the
victorious
heard
the
roar
from
far
off
and
thought
that
his
king
must
be
in
peril
he
came
to
the
place
and
without
asking
questions
thrust
his
spear
through
illann
the
dying
son
of
fergus
explained
the
situation
to
conall
who
by
way
of
making
some
amends
at
once
killed
fiacha
as
well
after
this
the
sons
of
usnach
held
their
fort
till
dawn
against
all
host
but
with
day
they
saw
that
they
must
either
escape
or
resign
themselves
to
perish
putting
deirdre
in
their
centre
protected
by
their
shields
they
opened
the
door
suddenly
and
fled
out
they
would
have
broken
through
and
escaped
had
not
conchobar
asked
cathbad
the
druid
to
put
a
spell
upon
them
promising
to
spare
their
lives
so
cathbad
raised
the
illusion
of
a
stormy
sea
before
and
all
around
the
sons
of
usnach
naoise
lifted
deirdre
upon
his
shoulder
but
the
magic
waves
rose
higher
until
they
were
all
obliged
to
fling
away
their
weapons
and
swim
then
was
seen
the
strange
sight
of
men
swimming
upon
dry
land
and
before
the
glamour
passed
away
the
sons
of
usnach
were
seized
from
behind
and
brought
to
conchobar
in
spite
of
his
promise
to
the
druid
the
king
condemned
them
to
death
none
of
the
men
of
ulster
would
however
deal
the
blow
in
the
end
a
foreigner
from
norway
whose
father
naoise
had
slain
offered
to
behead
them
each
of
the
brothers
begged
to
die
first
that
he
might
not
witness
the
deaths
of
the
others
but
naoise
ended
this
noble
rivalry
by
lending
their
executioner
the
sword
called
which
had
been
given
him
by
manannán
son
of
lêr
they
knelt
down
side
by
side
and
one
blow
of
the
sword
of
the
god
shore
off
all
their
heads
as
for
deirdre
there
are
varying
stories
of
her
death
but
most
of
them
agree
that
she
did
not
survive
the
sons
of
usnach
many
hours
but
before
she
died
she
made
an
elegy
over
them
that
it
is
of
a
singular
pathos
and
beauty
the
few
verses
which
there
is
space
to
give
will
show
the
day
without
children
it
was
not
mournful
to
be
in
their
company
sons
of
a
king
by
whom
sojourners
were
entertained
three
lions
from
the
hill
of
the
cave
darlings
of
the
women
of
britain
three
hawks
of
slieve
gullion
sons
of
a
king
whom
valour
served
to
whom
soldiers
used
to
give
homage
i
should
remain
after
naoise
let
no
one
in
the
world
suppose
after
ardan
and
ainle
my
time
would
not
be
long
my
first
husband
i
forsook
for
love
short
my
life
after
them
i
will
perform
their
funeral
game
them
i
shall
not
be
three
that
would
go
into
every
conflict
three
who
liked
to
endure
hardships
three
heroes
who
refused
not
combats

that
diggest
the
tomb
and
puttest
my
darling
from
me
make
not
the
grave
too
narrow
i
shall
be
beside
the
noble
it
was
a
poor
triumph
for
conchobar
deirdre
in
all
her
beauty
had
escaped
him
by
death
his
own
chief
followers
never
forgave
it
fergus
when
he
returned
from
feast
and
found
out
what
had
been
done
gathered
his
own
people
slew
son
and
many
of
his
warriors
and
fled
to
bitterest
enemies
ailill
and
medb
of
connaught

cathbad
the
druid
cursed
both
king
and
kingdom
praying
that
none
of
race
might
ever
reign
in
emain
macha
again
so
it
came
to
pass
the
capital
of
ulster
was
only
kept
from
ruin
by
prowess
when
he
perished
it
also
fell
and
soon
became

the
epoch

in
the
annals
of
ancient
ireland
by
a
succession
of
monarchs
who
though
doubtless
as
mythical
as
king
conchobar
and
his
court
seem
to
grow
gradually
more
human
their
line
lasts
for
about
two
centuries
culminating
in
a
dynasty
with
which
legend
has
occupied
itself
more
than
with
its
immediate
predecessors
this
is
the
one
which
began
according
to

of

there
prophesied
to
him
the
number
of
his
descendants
the
length
of
their
reigns
and
the
manner

as

of
cormac
many
irish
stories
occupy
themselves
with
the
fame
of
cormac
who
is
pictured
as
a
great
gaelic
solomon
certain
traditions
credit
him
with
having
been
the
first
to
believe
in
a
purer
doctrine
than
the
celtic
polytheism
and
even
with
having
attempted
to
put
down
druidism
in
revenge
for
which
a
druid
called
maelcen
sent
an
evil
spirit
who
placed
a

in
the
throat
as
he
sat
at
meat
and
so
compassed

death
another
class
of
stories
however
make
him
an
especial
favourite
with
those
same
heathen
deities
manannán
son
of
lêr
was
so
anxious
for
his
friendship
that
he
decoyed
him
into
fairyland
and
gave
him
a
magic
branch
it
was
of
silver
and
bore
golden
apples
and
when
it
was
shaken
it
made
such
sweet
music
that
the
wounded
the
sick
and
the
sorrowful
forgot
their
pains
and
were
lulled
into
deep
sleep
cormac
kept
this
treasure
all
his
life
but
at
his
death
it
returned
into
the
hands
of
the
gods
king
cormac
was
a
contemporary
of
finn
mac
coul
whom
he
appointed
head
of
the
more
generally
known
as
the
around
finn
and
his
men
have
gathered
a
cycle
of
legends
which
were
equally
popular
with
the
gaels
of
both
scotland
and
ireland
we
read
of
their
exploits
in
stories
and
poems
preserved
in
the
earliest
irish
manuscripts
while
among
the
peasantry
both
of
ireland
and
of
the
west
highlands
their
names
and
the
stories
connected
with
them
are
still
current
lore
upon
some
of
these
floating
traditions
as
preserved
in
folk
ballads
macpherson
founded
his
factitious
and
the
collection
of
them
from
the
lips
of
living
men
still
affords
plenty
of
employment
to
gaelic
students
how
far
finn
and
his
followers
may
have
been
historical
personages
it
is
impossible
to
say
the
irish
people
themselves
have
always
held
that
the
fenians
were
a
kind
of
native
militia
and
that
finn
was
their
general
the
early
historical
writers
of
ireland
supported
this
view
the
chronicler
tighernach
who
died
in
believed
in
him
and
the
of
the
four
compiled
between
the
years
and
from
older
chronicles
while
they
ignore
king
conchobar
and
his
red
branch
champions
as
unworthy
of
the
serious
consideration
of
historians
treat
finn
as
a
real
person
whose
death
took
place
in
even
so
great
a
modern
scholar
as
eugene
declared
in
the
clearest
language
that
finn
so
far
from
being
merely
imaginary
or
mythical
was
undoubtedly
historical
personage
and
that
he
existed
about
the
time
at
which
his
appearance
is
recorded
in
the
annals
is
as
certain
as
that
julius
caesar
lived
and
ruled
at
the
time
stated
on
the
authority
of
the
roman
the
opinion
of
more
recent
celtic
scholars
however
is
opposed
to
this
view
pedigree
preserved
in
the
book
of
leinster
may
seem
at
first
to
give
some
support
to
the
theory
of
his
real
existence
but
on
more
careful
examination
of
it
his
own
name
and
that
of
his
father
equally
bewray
him
finn
or
fionn
meaning
is
the
name
of
one
of
the
mythical
ancestors
of
the
gaels
while
his
name
cumhal
signifies
the
and
is
the
same
word
as
the
gaulish
identified
by
the
romans
with
mars
his
followers
are
as
doubtfully
human
as
himself
one
may
compare
them
with
cuchulainn
and
the
rest
of
the
heroes
of
emain
macha
their
deeds
are
not
less
marvellous
like
the
ultonian
warriors
they
move
too
on
equal
terms
with
the
gods
fianna
of
says
a
tract
called
dialogue
of
the
contained
in
thirteenth
and
fourteenth
century
manuscripts
not
more
frequent
and
free
intercourse
with
the
men
of
settled
habitation
than
with
the
tuatha

angus
mider
lêr
manannán
and
bodb
the
red
with
their
countless
sons
and
daughters
loom
as
large
in
the
fenian
or
stories
as
do
the
fenians
themselves
they
fight
for
them
or
against
them
they
marry
them
and
are
given
to
them
in
marriage
a
luminous
suggestion
of
professor
rhys
also
hints
that
the
fenians
inherited
the
conduct
of
that
ancient
war
formerly
waged
between
the
tuatha
dé
danann
and
the
fomors
the
most
common
antagonists
of
finn
and
his
heroes
are
tribes
of
invaders
from
oversea
called
in
the
stories
the
these
of
are
usually
identified
by
those
who
look
for
history
in
the
stories
of
the
fenian
cycle
with
the
invading
bands
of
norsemen
who
harried
the
irish
coasts
in
the
ninth
century
but
the
nucleus
of
the
fenian
tales
antedates
these
scandinavian
raids
and
mortal
foes
have
probably
merely
stepped
into
the
place
of
those
immortal
enemies
of
the
gods
whose
was
a
country
not
over
the
under
it
the
earlier
historians
of
ireland
were
as
ready
with
their
dates
and
facts
regarding
the
fenian
band
as
an
institution
as
with
the
personality
of
finn
it
was
said
to
have
been
first
organized
by
a
king
called
fiachadh
in
and
abolished
or
rather
exterminated
by
cairbré
the
son
of
cormac
mac
art
in
we
are
told
that
it
consisted
of
three
regiments
modelled
on
the
roman
legion
each
of
these
bodies
contained
on
a
peace
footing
three
thousand
men
but
in
time
of
war
could
be
indefinitely
strengthened
its
object
was
to
defend
the
coasts
of
ireland
and
the
country
generally
throwing
its
weight
upon
the
side
of
any
prince
who
happened
to
be
assailed
by
foreign
foes
during
the
six
months
of
winter
its
members
were
quartered
upon
the
population
but
during
the
summer
they
had
to
forage
for
themselves
which
they
did
by
hunting
and
fishing
thus
they
lived
in
the
woods
and
on
the
open
moors
hardening
themselves
for
battle
by
their
adventurous
life
the
sites
of
their
enormous
were
long
pointed
out
under
the
name
of
the
it
was
not
easy
to
become
a
member
of
this
famous
band
a
candidate
had
to
be
not
only
an
expert
warrior
but
a
poet
and
a
man
of
culture
as
well
he
had
practically
to
renounce
his
tribe
at
any
rate
he
made
oath
that
he
would
neither
avenge
any
of
his
relatives
nor
be
avenged
by
them
he
put
himself
under
bonds
never
to
refuse
hospitality
to
anyone
who
asked
never
to
turn
his
back
in
battle
never
to
insult
any
woman
and
not
to
accept
a
dowry
with
his
wife
in
addition
to
all
this
he
had
to
pass
successfully
through
the
most
stringent
physical
tests
indeed
as
these
have
come
down
to
us
magnified
by
the
perfervid
celtic
imagination
they
are
of
an
altogether
marvellous
and
impossible
character
an
aspirant
to
the
we
are
told
had
first
to
stand
up
to
his
knees
in
a
pit
dug
for
him
his
only
arms
being
his
shield
and
a
hazel
wand
while
nine
warriors
each
with
a
spear
standing
within
the
distance
of
nine
ridges
of
land
all
hurled
their
weapons
at
him
at
once
if
he
failed
to
ward
them
all
off
he
was
rejected
should
he
succeed
in
this
first
test
he
was
given
the
distance
of
one
start
and
chased
through
a
forest
by
armed
men
if
any
of
them
came
up
to
him
and
wounded
him
he
could
not
belong
to
the
fenians
if
he
escaped
unhurt
but
had
unloosed
a
single
lock
of
his
braided
hair
or
had
broken
a
single
branch
in
his
flight
or
if
at
the
end
of
the
run
his
weapons
trembled
in
his
hands
he
was
refused
as
besides
these
tests
he
was
obliged
to
jump
over
a
branch
as
high
as
his
forehead
and
stoop
under
one
as
low
as
his
knee
while
running
at
full
speed
and
to
pluck
a
thorn
out
of
his
heel
without
hindrance
to
his
flight
it
is
clear
that
even
the
rank
and
file
of
the
fenians
must
have
been
quite
exceptional
athletes
but
it
is
time
to
pass
on
to
a
more
detailed
description
of
these
champions
they
are
a
goodly
company
not
less
heroic
than
the
mighty
men
of
ulster
first
comes
finn
himself
not
the
strongest
in
body
of
the
fenians
but
the
truest
wisest
and
kindest
gentle
to
women
generous
to
men
and
trusted
by
all
if
he
could
help
it
he
would
never
let
anyone
be
in
trouble
or
poverty
the
dead
leaves
of
the
forest
had
been
gold
and
the
white
foam
of
the
water
silver
finn
would
have
given
it
all
finn
had
two
sons
fergus
and
his
more
famous
brother
ossian
fergus
of
the
sweet
speech
was
the
bard
and
also
because
of
his
honeyed
words
their
diplomatist
and
ambassador
yet
by
the
irony
of
fate
it
is
to
ossian
who
is
not
mentioned
as
a
poet
in
the
earliest
texts
that
the
poems
concerning
the
fenians
which
are
current
in
scotland
under
the
name
of
are
attributed
mother
was
sadb
a
daughter
of
bodb
the
red
a
rival
goddess
changed
her
into
a
explains
how
ossian
got
his
name
which
means
with
such
advantages
of
birth
naturally
he
was
speedy
enough
to
run
down
a
red
deer
hind
and
catch
her
by
the
ear
though
far
less
than
his
cousin
caoilte
the
neither
was
he
so
strong
as
his
own
son
oscar
the
mightiest
of
all
the
fenians
yet
in
his
youth
so
clumsy
that
the
rest
of
the
band
refused
to
take
him
with
them
on
their
warlike
expeditions
they
changed
their
minds
however
when
one
day
he
followed
them
unawares
found
them
giving
way
before
an
enemy
and
rushing
to
their
help
armed
only
with
a
great
log
of
wood
which
lay
handy
on
the
ground
turned
the
fortunes
of
the
fight
after
this

hailed

best
warrior
of

of

skilled
alike
in
war
and
learning
even
though
he
was

are
told
that
he
was
much
loved
by
women
but
not
so
much
as
cousin
diarmait
whose
fatal
beauty
ensnared

is
represented
as
an
old
bald
vain
irritable
man
as
great

and
as
as
thersites
and
yet
after
he

once
been
shamed
into
activity
a
true
man
of
his
hands
these
are
the
prime
fenian
heroes
the
chief
actors
in
its
stories
the
fenian
epic
begins
before
the
birth
of
its
hero
with
the
struggle
of
two
rival
clans
each
of
whom
claimed
to
be
the
real
and
only
fianna
eirinn
they
were
called
the
clann
morna
of
which
goll
mac
morna
was
head
and
the
clann
baoisgne
commanded
by
father
cumhal

battle
was
fought
at
cnucha
in

goll
killed
cumhal
and
the

was
scattered

however
bore
a
posthumous
son
who
was
brought
up
among
the
slieve
bloom
mountains
secretly
for
fear
his
enemies
should
find
and
kill
him
the
boy
who
was
at
first
called
deimne
grew
up
to
be
an
expert
hurler
swimmer
runner
and
hunter
later
like
cuchulainn
and
indeed
many
modern
savages
he
took
a
second
more
personal
name
those
who
saw
him
asked
who
was
the
youth
he
accepted
the
omen
and
called
himself
deimne
finn
at
length
he
wandered
to
the
banks
of
the
boyne
where
he
found
a
soothsayer
called
finn
the
seer
living
beside
a
deep
pool
near
slane
named
in
hope
of
catching
one
of
the
of
and
by
eating
it
obtaining
universal
wisdom
he
had
been
there
seven
years
without
result
though
success
had
been
prophesied
to
one
named
when
the
wandering
son
of
cumhal
appeared
finn
the
seer
engaged
him
as
his
servant
shortly
afterwards
he
caught
the
coveted
fish
and
handed
it
over
to
our
finn
to
cook
warning
him
to
eat
no
portion
of
it
you
eaten
any
of
it
he
asked
the
boy
as
he
brought
it
up
ready
boiled
indeed
replied
finn
while
i
was
cooking
it
a
blister
rose
upon
the
skin
and
laying
my
thumb
down
upon
the
blister
i
scalded
it
and
so
i
put
it
into
my
mouth
to
ease
the
the
man
was
perplexed
told
me
your
name
was
deimne
he
said
have
you
any
other
name
i
am
also
called
is
enough
replied
his
disappointed
master
the
salmon
yourself
for
you
must
be
the
one
of
whom
the
prophecy
finn
ate
the
of
and
thereafter
he
had
only
to
put
his
thumb
under
his
tooth
as
he
had
done
when
he
scalded
it
to
receive
and
magic
counsel
thus
armed
finn
was
more
than
a
match
for
the
clann
morna
curious
legends
tell
how
he
discovered
himself
to
his
old
followers
confounded
his
enemies
with
his
magic
and
turned
them
into
faithful
servants
even
goll
of
the
blows
had
to
submit
to
his
sway
gradually
he
welded
the
two
opposing
clans
into
one
fianna
over
which
he
ruled
taking
tribute
from
the
kings
of
ireland
warring
against
the
fomorian

every
kind

or
monster
that
infested

land
and
at
last
carrying
his
mythical
conquests
over
all
europe
out
of
the
numberless
stories
of
the
fenian
exploits
it
is
hard
to
choose
examples
all
are
heroic
romantic
wild
fantastic
in
many
of
them

tuatha

prominent
parts
one
such
story
connects
itself
with
an
earlier
mythological
episode
already
related
the
reader
will
remember
how
when
the
dagda
gave
up
the
kingship
of
the
immortals
five
aspirants
appeared
to
claim
it
how
of
these
mider
lêr
ilbhreach
son
of
manannán
and
bodb
the
latter
was
chosen
how
lêr
refused
to
acknowledge
him
but
was
reconciled
later
how
mider
equally
rebellious
fled
to
country
round
mount
in
county
carlow
and
how
a
yearly
war
was
waged
upon
him
and
his
people
by
the
rest
of
the
gods
to
bring
them
to
subjection
this
war
was
still
raging
in
the
time
of
finn
and
mider
was
not
too
proud
to
seek
his
help
one
day
that
finn
was
hunting
in
donegal
with
ossian
oscar
caoilte
and
diarmait
their
hounds
roused
a
beautiful
fawn
which
although
at
every
moment
apparently
nearly
overtaken
led
them
in
full
chase
as
far
as
mount
leinster
here
it
suddenly
disappeared
into
a
cleft
in
the
hillside
heavy
snow
the
branches
as
it
were
a
now
fell
forcing
the
fenians
to
seek
for
some
shelter
and
they
therefore
explored
the
place
into
which
the
fawn
had
vanished
it
led
to
a
splendid
in
the
hollow
of
the
hill
entering
it
they
were
greeted
by
a
beautiful
who
told
them
that
it
was
she
daughter
who
had
been
the
fawn
and
that
she
had
taken
that
shape
purposely
to
lead
them
there
in
the
hope
of
getting
their
help
against
the
army
that
was
coming
to
attack
the
finn
asked
who
the
assailants
would
be
and
was
told
that
they
were
bodb

red
with
his
seven

over

from

and
the
islands
as
well

promised
his
aid
and
with
the
twilight
of
that
same
day
the
attacking
forces
appeared
and
made
their
annual
assault
they
were
beaten
off
after
a
battle
that
lasted
all

with
the
loss
of

most
of
many
sons
were
sorely
wounded
but
the
leech
labhra
healed
all
their
wounds
sooth
to
say
the
fenians
did
not
always
require
the
excuse
of
fairy
alliance
to
start
them
making
war
on
the
race
of
the
hills
one
of
the
is
entitled
chase
of
the
enchanted
pigs
of
angus
of
the
brugh
this
angus
is
of
course
the
of
the
and
the
brugh
that
famous
beside
the
boyne
out
of
which
he
cheated
his
father
the
dagda
after
the
friendly
manner
of
gods
towards
heroes
he
invited
finn
and
a
picked
thousand
of
his
followers
to
a
banquet
at
the
brugh
they
came
to
it
in
their
finest
clothes
went
from
hand
to
hand
and
waiters
were
kept
in
at
last
conversation
fell
upon
the
comparative
merits
of
the
pleasures
of
the
table
and
of
the
chase
angus
stoutly
contending
that
life
of
perpetual
was
better
than
all
the
fenian
huntings
and
finn
as
stoutly
denying
it
finn
boasted
of
his
hounds
and
angus
said
that
the
best
of
them
could
not
kill
one
of
his
pigs
finn
angrily
replied
that
his
two
hounds
bran
and
sgeolan
would
kill
any
pig
that
trod
on
dry
land
angus
answered
that
he
could
show
finn
a
pig
that
none
of
his
hounds
or
huntsmen
could
catch
or
kill
here
were
the
makings
of
a
pretty
quarrel
among
such
inflammable
creatures
as
gods
and
heroes
but
the
steward
of
the
feast
interposed
and
sent
everyone
to
bed
the
next
morning
finn
left
the
brugh
for
he
did
not
want
to
fight
all
fairies
with
his
handful
of
a
thousand
men
a
year
passed
before
he
heard
more
of
it
then
came
a
messenger
from
angus
reminding
finn
of
his
promise
to
pit
his
men
and
hounds
against
pigs
the
fenians
seated
themselves
on
the
tops
of
the
hills
each
with
his
favourite
hound
in
leash
and
they
had
not
been
there
long
before
there
appeared
on
the
eastern
plain
a
hundred
and
one
such
pigs
as
no
fenian
had
ever
seen
before
each
was
as
tall
as
a
deer
and
blacker
than
a
coals
having
hair
like
a
thicket
and
bristles
like
masts
yet
such
was
the
prowess
of
the
fenians
that
they
killed
them
all
though
each
of
the
pigs
slew
ten
men
and
many
hounds
then
angus
complained
that
the
fenians
had
murdered
his
son
and
many
others
of
the
tuatha
dé
danann
who
indeed
were
none
other
than
the
pigs
whose
forms
they
had
taken
there
were
mighty
recriminations
on
both
sides
and
in
the
end
the
enraged
fenians
prepared
to
attack
the
brugh
on
the
boyne
then
only
did
angus
begin
to
yield
and
by
the
advice
of
ossian
finn
made
peace
with
him
and
his
fairy
folk
such
are
specimens
of
the
tales
which
go
to
make
up
the
fenian
cycle
of
sagas
hunting
is
the
most
prominent
feature
of
them
for
the
fenians
were
essentially
a
race
of
mighty
hunters
but
the
creatures
of
their
chase
were
not
always
flesh
and
blood
enchanters
who
wished
the
fenians
ill
could
always
lure
them
into
danger
by
taking
the
shape
of
boar
or
deer
and
many
a
story
begins
with
an
innocent
chase
and
ends
with
a
murderous
battle
but
out
of
such
struggles
the
fenians
always
emerge
successfully
as
ossian
is
represented
proudly
boasting
truthfulness
and
the
might
of
their
the
most
famous
chase
of
all
is
however
not
that
of
deer
or
boar
but
of
a
woman
and
a
man
betrothed
wife
and
his
nephew
diarmait
ever
fortunate
in
war
the
fenian
leader
found
disaster
in
his
love
wishing
for
a
wife
in
his
old
age
he
sent
to
seek
grainne
the
daughter
of
cormac
the
of
ireland
both
king
cormac
and
his
daughter
consented
and
ambassadors
returned
with
an
invitation
to
the
suitor
to
come
in
a
time
to
claim
his
bride
he
arrived
with
his
picked
band
and
was
received
in
state
in
the
great
of
tara
there
they
feasted
and
there
grainne
the
daughter
casting
her
eyes
over
the
assembled
fenian
heroes
saw
diarmait
this
fenian
adonis
had
a
upon
his
cheek
which
no
woman
could
see
without
falling
instantly
in
love
with
him
grainne
for
all
her
royal
birth
was
no
exception
to
this
rule
she
asked
a
druid
to
point
her
out
the
principal
guests
the
druid
told
her
all
their
names
and
exploits
then
she
called
for
a
jewelled
and
filling
it
with
a
drugged
wine
sent
it
round
to
each
in
turn
except
to
diarmait
none
could
be
so
discourteous
as
to
refuse
wine
from
the
hand
of
a
princess
all
drank
and
fell
into
deep
sleep
then
rising
she
came
to
diarmait
told
him
her
passion
for
him
and
asked
for
its
return
will
not
love
the
betrothed
of
my
chief
he
replied
even
if
i
wished
i
dare
and
he
praised
virtues
and
decried
his
own
fame
but
grainne
merely
answered
that
she
put
him
under
bonds
which
no
hero
could
refuse
to
redeem
to
flee
with
her
and
at
once
went
back
to
her
chair
before
the
rest
of
the
company
awoke
from
their
slumber
after
the
feast
diarmait
went
round
to
his
comrades
one
by
one
and
told
them
of
love
for
him
and
of
the
she
had
placed
upon
him
to
take
her
from
tara
he
asked
each
of
them
what
he
ought
to
do
all
answered
that
no
hero
could
break
a
put
upon
him
by
a
woman
he
even
asked
finn
concealing
name
and
finn
gave
him
the
same
counsel
as
the
others
that
night
the
lovers
fled
from
tara
to
the
ford
of
the
shannon
at
athlone
crossed
it
and
came
to
a
place
called
the
of
the
two
where
diarmait
wove
a
hut
of
branches
for
grainne
to
shelter
in
meanwhile
finn
had
discovered
their
flight
and
his
rage
knew
no
bounds
he
sent
his
trackers
the
clann
neamhuain
to
follow
them
they
tracked
them
to
the
wood
and
one
of
them
climbed
a
tree
and
looking
down
saw
the
hut
with
a
strong
fence
built
round
it
and
diarmait
and
grainne
inside
when
the
news
came
to
the
fenians
they
were
sorry
for
their
sympathies
were
with
diarmait
and
not
with
finn
they
tried
to
warn
him
but
he
took
no
heed
for
he
had
determined
to
fight
and
not
to
flee
indeed
when
finn
himself
came
to
the
fence
and
called
over
it
to
diarmait
asking
if
he
and
grainne
were
within
he
replied
that
they
were
but
that
none
should
enter
unless
he
gave
permission
so
diarmait
like
cuchulainn
in
the
war
of
ulster
against
ireland
found
himself
matched
against
a
host
but
also
like
cuchulainn
he
had
a
divine
helper
the
favourite
of
the
tuatha
dé
danann
he
had
been
the
pupil
of
manannán
son
of
lêr
in
the
of
and
had
been
fostered
by
angus
of
the
brugh
manannán
had
given
him
his
two
spears
the
and
the
and
his
two
swords
the
and
the
and
now
angus
came
to
look
for
his
and
brought
with
him
the
magic
mantle
of
invisibility
used
by
the
gods
he
advised
diarmait
and
grainne
to
come
out
wrapped
in
the
cloak
and
thus
rendered
invisible
diarmait
still
refused
to
flee
but
asked
angus
to
protect
grainne
wrapping
the
magic
mantle
round
her
the
god
led
the
princess
away
unseen
by
any
of
the
fenians
by
this
time
finn
had
posted
men
outside
all
the
seven
doors
in
the
fence
diarmait
went
to
each
of
them
in
turn
at
the
first
were
ossian
and
oscar
with
the
clann
baoisgne
they
offered
him
their
protection
at
the
second
were
caoilte
and
the
clann
ronan
who
said
they
would
fight
to
the
death
for
him
at
the
third
were
conan
and
the
clann
morna
also
his
friends
at
the
fourth
stood
cuan
with
the
fenians
of
munster
native
province
at
the
fifth
were
the
ulster
fenians
who
also
promised
him
protection
against
finn
but
at
the
sixth
were
the
clann
neamhuain
who
hated
him
and
at
the
seventh
was
finn
himself
is
by
your
door
that
i
will
pass
out
o
finn
cried
diarmait
finn
charged
his
men
to
surround
diarmait
as
he
came
out
and
kill
him
but
he
leaped
the
fence
passing
clean
over
their
heads
and
fled
away
so
swiftly
that
they
could
not
follow
him
he
never
halted
till
he
reached
the
place
to
which
he
knew
angus
had
taken
grainne
the
friendly
god
left
them
with
a
little
sage
advice
never
to
hide
in
a
tree
with
only
one
trunk
never
to
rest
in
a
cave
with
only
one
entrance
never
to
land
on
an
island
with
only
one
channel
of
approach
not
to
eat
their
supper
where
they
had
cooked
it
nor
to
sleep
where
they
had
supped
and
where
they
had
slept
once
never
to
sleep
again
with
these
tactics
it
was
some
time
before
finn
discovered
them
however
he
found
out
at
last
where
they
were
and
sent
champions
with
venomous
hounds
to
take
or
kill
them
but
diarmait
conquered
all
who
were
sent
against
him
yet
still
finn
pursued
until
diarmait
as
a
last
hope
of
escape
took
refuge
under
a
magic
which
bore
scarlet
fruit
the
ambrosia
of
the
gods
it
had
grown
from
a
single
berry
dropped
by
one
of
the
tuatha
dé
danann
who
when
they
found
that
they
had
carelessly
endowed
mortals
with
celestial
and
immortal
food
had
sent
a
huge
fomor
called
sharvan
the
surly
to
guard
it
so
that
no
man
might
eat
of
its
fruit
all
day
this
fomor
sat
at
the
foot
of
the
tree
and
all
night
he
slept
among
its
branches
and
so
terrible
was
his
appearance
that
neither
the
fenians
nor
any
other
people
dared
to
come
within
several
miles
of
him
but
diarmait
was
willing
to
brave
the
fomor
in
the
hope
of
getting
a
safe
for
grainne
he
came
boldly
up
to
him
and
asked
leave
to
camp
and
hunt
in
his
neighbourhood
the
fomor
told
him
surlily
that
he
might
camp
and
hunt
where
he
pleased
so
long
as
he
refrained
from
taking
any
of
the
scarlet
berries
so
diarmait
built
a
hut
near
a
spring
and
he
and
grainne
lived
there
killing
the
wild
animals
for
food
but
unhappily
grainne
conceived
so
strong
a
desire
to
eat
the
quicken
berries
that
she
felt
that
she
must
die
unless
her
wish
could
be
gratified
at
first
she
tried
to
hide
this
longing
but
in
the
end
she
was
forced
to
tell
her
companion
diarmait
had
no
desire
to
quarrel
with
the
fomor
so
he
went
to
him
and
told
the
plight
that
grainne
was
in
and
asked
for
a
handful
of
the
berries
as
a
gift
but
the
fomor
merely
answered
swear
to
you
that
if
nothing
would
save
the
princess
and
her
unborn
child
except
my
berries
and
if
she
were
the
last
woman
upon
the
earth
she
should
not
have
any
of
whereupon
diarmait
fought
the
fomor
and
after
much
trouble
killed
him
it
was
reported
to
finn
that
the
guardian
of
the
magic
lived
no
longer
and
he
guessed
that
diarmait
must
have
killed
him
so
he
came
down
to
the
place
with
seven
battalions
of
the
fenians
to
look
for
him
by
this
time
diarmait
had
abandoned
his
own
hut
and
taken
possession
of
that
built
by
the
fomor
among
the
branches
of
the
magic
quicken
he
was
sitting
in
it
with
grainne
when
finn
and
his
men
came
and
camped
at
the
foot
of
the
tree
to
wait
till
the
heat
of
noon
had
passed
before
beginning
their
search
to
beguile
the
time
finn
called
for
his
and
challenged
his
son
ossian
to
a
game
they
played
until
ossian
had
only
one
more
move
move
would
make
you
a
winner
said
finn
to
him
i
challenge
you
and
all
the
fenians
to
guess
only
diarmait
who
had
been
looking
down
through
the
branches
upon
the
players
knew
the
move
he
could
not
resist
dropping
a
berry
on
to
the
board
so
deftly
that
it
hit
the
very
which
ossian
ought
to
move
in
order
to
win
ossian
took
the
hint
moved
it
and
won
a
second
and
a
third
game
were
played
and
in
each
case
the
same
thing
happened
then
finn
felt
sure
that
the
berries
that
had
prompted
ossian
must
have
been
thrown
by
diarmait
he
called
out
asking
diarmait
if
he
were
there
and
the
fenian
hero
who
never
spoke
an
untruth
answered
that
he
was
so
the
was
surrounded
by
armed
men
just
as
the
fenced
hut
in
the
woods
had
been
but
again
things
happened
in
the
same
way
for
angus
of
the
brugh
took
away
grainne
wrapped
in
the
invisible
magic
cloak
while
diarmait
walking
to
the
end
of
a
thick
branch
cleared
the
circle
of
fenians
at
a
bound
and
escaped
untouched
this
was
the
end
of
the
famous
for
angus
came
as
ambassador
to
finn
urging
him
to
become
reconciled
to
the
fugitives
and
all
the
best
of
the
fenians
begged
finn
to
consent
so
diarmait
and
grainne
were
allowed
to
return
in
peace
but
finn
never
really
forgave
and
soon
after
he
urged
diarmait
to
go
out
to
the
chase
of
the
wild
boar
of
benn
gulban
diarmait
killed
the
boar
without
getting
any
hurt
for
like
the
greek
achilles
he
was
invulnerable
save
in
his
heel
alone
finn
who
knew
this
told
him
to
measure
out
the
length
of
the
skin
with
his
bare
feet
diarmait
did
so
then
finn
declaring
that
he
had
measured
it
wrongly
ordered
him
to
tread
it
again
in
the
opposite
direction
this
was
against
the
lie
of
the
bristles
and
one
of
them
pierced
heel
and
inflicted
a
poisoned
and
mortal
wound
this
of
diarmait
and
which
has
been
told
at
such
length
marks
in
some
degree
the
climax
of
the
fenian
power
after
which
it
began
to
decline
towards
its
end
the
friends
of
diarmait
never
forgave
the
treachery
with
which
finn
had
compassed
his
death
the
rivalry
between
goll
and
his
clann
morna
and
finn
and
his
clann
baoisgne
began
to
show
itself
as
open
enmity
quarrels
arose
too
between
the
fenians
and
the
of
ireland
which
culminated
at
last
in
the
annihilation
of
the
fianna
at
the
battle
of
gabhra
this
is
said
to
have
been
fought
in
finn
himself
had
perished
a
year
before
it
in
a
skirmish
with
rebellious
fenians
at
the
ford
of
brea
on
the
boyne
king
cormac
the
magnificent
father
was
also
dead
it
was
between
grandson
oscar
and
son
cairbré
that
war
broke
out
this
mythical
battle
was
as
fiercely
waged
as
that
of
last
fight
at
camlan
oscar
slew
cairbré
and
was
slain
by
him
almost
all
the
fenians
fell
as
well
as
all
forces
only
two
of
the
greater
fenian
figures
survived
one
was
caoilte
whose
swiftness
of
foot
saved
him
at
the
end
when
all
was
lost
the
famous
story
called
the
of
the
represents
him
discoursing
to
patrick
centuries
after
of
the
wonderful
deeds
having
lost
his
friends
of
the
heroic
age
he
is
said
to
have
cast
in
his
lot
with
the
tuatha
dé
danann
he
fought
in
a
battle
with
ilbhreach
son
of
manannán
against
lêr
himself
and
killed
the
ancient
with
his
own
hand
the
tale
represents
him
taking
possession
of
fairy
palace
of
sídh
fionnechaidh
after
which
we
know
no
more
of
him
except
that
he
has
taken
rank
in
the
minds
of
the
irish
peasantry
as
one
of
and
a
ruler
among
the
sídhe
the
other
was
ossian
who
did
not
fight
at
gabhra
for
long
before
he
had
taken
the
great
journey
which
most
heroes
of
mythology
take
to
that
bourne
from
which
no

the
fenians
were
hunting
near
lake
killarney
when
a
lady
of
more
than
human
beauty
came
to
them
and
told
them
that
her
name
was
niamh
daughter
of
the
son
of
the

the
gaelic
poet
michael
comyn
who
in
the
eighteenth
century
rewove
the
ancient
story
into
his
own
words
describes
her
in
just
the

way
as
one
of
the
old
bards
would
have
done

mantle
of
precious
silk
spangled
with
stars
of
red
gold
covering

shoes
down
to

gold
ring
was
hanging
down
from
each
yellow
curl
of
her
golden
hair
her
eyes
blue
clear
and
cloudless
like
a
on
the
top
of
the
grass
were
her
cheeks
than
the
rose
fairer
was
her
visage
than
the

upon

more
sweet
was
the
taste
of
her
balsam
lips
than

wide

the

there
was

held
a
bridle
with
a
golden
bit

of

a

was
on

and
there
was
not
in

a

such
was
niamh
of
the
golden

daughter
and
it
is
small
wonder
that
when
she
chose
ossian
from
among
the
sons
of
men
to
be
her
lover
all
supplications
could
not
keep
him
he
mounted
behind
her
on
her
fairy
horse
and
they
rode
across
the
land
to
the
and
then
over
the
tops
of
the
waves
as
they
went
she
described
the
country
of
the

to
him
in
just
the

terms
as

not

with
bright
and
walls
appeared
on
the
surface
of
the
sea
at
one
of
these
they
halted
and
ossian
at
request
attacked
a
fierce
fomor
who
lived
there
and
set
free
a
damsel
of
the
tuatha
dé
danann
whom
he
kept
imprisoned
he
saw
a
hornless
fawn
leap
from
wave
to

chased
by
one
of
those
strange
hounds
of
celtic
myth
which
are
pure
white
with
red
ears
at
last
they
reached
the
of
the
and
there
ossian
dwelt
with
niamh
for
three
hundred
years
before
he
remembered
erin
and
the
fenians
then
a
great
wish
came
upon
him
to
see
his
own
country
and
his
own
people
again
and
niamh
gave
him
leave
to
go
and
mounted
him
upon
a
fairy
steed
for
the
journey
one
thing
alone
she
made
him
to
let
his
feet
touch
earthly
soil
ossian
promised
and
reached
ireland
on
the
wings
of
the
wind
but
like
the
children
of
lêr
at
the
end
of
their
penance
he
found
all
changed
he
asked
for
finn
and
the
fenians
and
was
told
that
they
were
the
names
of
people
who
had
lived
long
ago
and
whose
deeds
were
written
of
in
old
books
the
battle
of
gabhra
had
been
fought
and
patrick
had
come
to
ireland
and
made
all
things
new
the
very
forms
of
men
had
altered
they
seemed
dwarfs
compared
with
the
giants
of
his
day
seeing
three
hundred
of
them
trying
in
vain
to
raise
a
marble
slab
he
rode
up
to
them
in
contemptuous
kindness
and
lifted
it
with
one
hand
but
as
he
did
so
the
golden
broke
with
the
strain
and
he
touched
the
earth
with
his
feet
the
fairy
horse
vanished
and
ossian
rose
from
the
ground
no
longer
divinely
young
and
fair
and
strong
but
a
blind
withered
old
man

may
be

he
will
but
repent
and
in
the
darkest
the

in
which
he
tells
him
his
old
comrades
now
lie
in
anguish
ossian
replies
to
the
arguments
entreaties
and
threats
in
language
which
is
extraordinarily
frank
he
will
not
believe
that
heaven
could
be
closed

fenians

they
wished
to
enter
it

god
himself

other
great
surviving
fenian
was
also
represented
as
having
gladly

lore
for
the
faith
and
salvation
offered
him
we
may
see
the
same
influence
on
foot
in
the
later
legends
concerning
the
red
branch
champions
it
was
the
policy
of
the
first
christianizers
of
ireland
to
describe
the
loved
heroes
of
their
still
flocks
as
having
handed
in
their
submission
to
the
new
creed
the
tales
about
conchobar
and
cuchulainn
were
amended
to
prove
that
those
very
pagan
personages
had
been
miraculously
brought
to
accept
the
gospel
at
the
last
an
entirely
new
story
told
how
the
latter
hero
was
raised
from
the
dead
by
saint
patrick
that
he
might
bear
witness
of
the
truth
of
christianity
to
laogaire
the
second
king
of
ireland
which
he
did
with
such
fervour
and
eloquence
that
the
sceptical
monarch
was
convinced
daring
attempts
were
also
made
to
change
the
tuatha
dé
danann
from
pagan
gods
into
christian
saints
but
these
were
by
no
means
so
profitable
as
the
policy
pursued
towards
the
more
heroes
with
one
of
them
alone
was
success
immediate
and
brilliant
brigit
the
goddess
of
fire
poetry
and
the
hearth
is
famous
as
saint
bridget
or
bride
most
popular
of
all
the
irish
saints
she
can
still
be
easily
recognized
as
the
daughter
of
the
dagda
her
christian
attributes
almost
all
connected
with
fire
attest
her
pagan
origin
she
was
born
at
sunrise
a
house
in
which
she
dwelt
blazed
into
a
flame
which
reached
to
heaven
a
pillar
of
fire
rose
from
her
head
when
she
took
the
veil
and
her
breath
gave
new
life
to
the
dead
as
with
the
british
goddess
sul
worshipped
at
bath
first
century
latin
writer
solinus
tells
over
the
boiling
springs
and
at
her
altar
there
flamed
a
perpetual
fire
which
never
whitened
into
ashes
but
hardened
into
a
stony
the
sacred
flame
on
her
shrine
at
kildare
was
never
allowed
to
go
out
it
was
extinguished
once
in
the
thirteenth
century
but
was
relighted
and
burnt
with
undying
glow
until
the
suppression
of
the
monasteries
by
henry
the
eighth
this
sacred
fire
might
not
be
breathed
on
by
the
impure
human
breath
for
nineteen
nights
it
was
tended
by
her
nuns
but
on
the
twentieth
night
it
was
left
untouched
and
kept
itself
alight
miraculously
with
so
little
of
her
essential
character
and
ritual
changed
it
is
small
wonder
that
the
irish
gladly
accepted
the
new
saint
in
the
stead
of
the
old
goddess
doubtless
a
careful
examination
of
irish
hagiology
would
result
in
the
discovery
of
many
other
saints
whose
names
and
attributes
might
render
them
suspect
of
previous
careers
as
pagan
gods
but
their
acceptation
was
not
sufficiently
general
to
do
away
with
the
need
of
other
means
of
counteracting
the
still
living
influence
of
the
gaelic
pantheon
therefore
a
fresh
school
of
euhemerists
arose
to
prove
that
the
gods
were
never
even
saints
but
merely
worldly
men
who
had
once
lived
and
ruled
in
erin
learned
monks
worked
hard
to
construct
a
history
of
ireland
from
the
flood
downwards
eugene
has
compiled
from
the
various
pedigrees
they
elaborated
and
inserted
into
the
books
of
ballymote
lecan
and
leinster
an
amazing
genealogy
which
shows
how
not
merely
the
tuatha
dé
danann
but
also
the
fir
bolgs
the
fomors
the
milesians
and
the
races
of
partholon
and
nemed
were
descended
from
noah
japhet
the
son
was
the
father
of
magog
from
whom
came
two
lines
the
first
being
the
milesians
while
the
second
branched
out
into
all
the
other
races
having
once
worked
the
gods
first
into
universal
history
and
then
into
the
history
of
ireland
it
was
an
easy
matter
to
supply
them
with
dates
of
birth
and
death
local
habitations
and
places
of
burial
we
are
told
with
precision
exactly
how
long
nuada
the
dagda
lugh
and
the
others
reigned
at
tara
the
barrows
by
the
boyne
provided
them
with
comfortable
tombs
their
enemies
the
fomors
became
real
invaders
who
were
beaten
in
real
battles
thus
it
was
thought
to
make
plain
prose
of
their
divinities
it
is
only
fair
however
to
these
early
euhemerists
to
say
that
they
have
their
modern
disciples
there
are
many
writers
of
recognized
authority
upon
their
subjects
who
in
dealing
with
the
history
of
ireland
or
the
composition
of
the
british
race
claim
to
find
real
peoples
in
the
tribes
mentioned
in
gaelic
myth
unfortunately
the
only
point
they
agree
upon
is
the
accepted
the
were
aryan
celts
they
are
divided
upon
the
question
of
the
in
whom
some
see
the
tribes
while
others
led
astray
by
the
name
regard
them
as
belgic
gauls
and
over
the
really
mythological
races
they
run
wild
in
the
tuatha
dé
danann
are
variously
found
gaels
picts
danes
scandinavians
ligurians
and
finns
while
the
fomors
rest
under
the
suspicion
of
having
been
iberians
moors
romans
finns
goths
or
teutons
as
for
the
people
of
partholon
and
nemed
they
have
even
been
explained
as
men
of
the
palæolithic
age
this
chaos
of
opinion
was
fortunately
avoided
by
the
native
annalists
who
had
no
particular
views
upon
the
question
of
race
except
that
everybody
came
from
of
course
there
were
dissenters
from
this
prevailing
mania
for
euhemerization
as
late
as
the
tenth
century
a
poet
called
eochaid
writing
of
the
tuatha
dé
danann
at
first
seems
to
hesitate
whether
to
ascribe
humanity
or
divinity
to
them
and
at
last
frankly
avows
their
godhead
in
his
poem
preserved
in
the
book
of
ballymote
he
says
they
came
to
learned
erinn
without
buoyant
adventurous
ships
no
man
in
creation
knew
whether
they
were
of
the
earth
or
of
the
sky
they
were
diabolical
demons
they
came
from
that
woeful
expulsion
if
they
were
of
a
race
of
tribes
and
nations
if
they
were
human
they
were
of
the
race
of
then
he
enumerates
them
in
due
succession
and
ends
by
declaring
i
have
treated
of
these
deities
in
their
order
yet
i
have
not
adored
one
may
surmise
with
probability
that
the
common
people
agreed
rather
with
the
poet
than
with
the
monk
pious
men
in
monasteries
might
write
what
they
liked
but
mere
laymen
would
not
be
easily
persuaded
that
their
cherished
gods
had
never
been
anything
more
than
men
like
themselves
probably
they
said
little
but
acted
in
secret
according
to
their
inherited
ideas
let
it
be
granted
for
the
sake
of
peace
that
goibniu
was
only
a
man
none
the
less
his
name
was
known
to
be
uncommonly
effective
in
an
incantation
this
applied
equally
to
diancecht
and
invocations
to
both
of
them
are
contained
in
some
verses
which
an
irish
monk
wrote
on
the
margin
of
a
manuscript
still
preserved
at
gall
in
switzerland
some
prescriptions
of
have
come
down
to
us
but
it
must
be
admitted
that
they
hardly
differ
from
those
current
among
ordinary
mediæval
physicians
perhaps
after
that
unfortunate
spilling
of
the
herbs
that
grew
out
of
body
he
had
to
fall
back
upon
empirical
research
he
invented
a
porridge
for
relief
of
ailments
of
the
body
as
cold
phlegm
throat
cats
and
the
presence
of
living
things
in
the
body
as
it
was
compounded
of
hazel
buds
dandelion
chickweed
sorrel
and
oatmeal
and
was
to
be
taken
every
morning
and
evening
he
also
prescribed
against
the
effects
of
witchcraft
and
the
fourteen
diseases
of
the
stomach
goibniu
in
addition
to
his
original
character
as
the
divine
smith
and
sorcerer
gained
a
third
reputation
among
the
irish
as
a
great
builder
and
as
such
he
is
known
as
the
gobhan
saer
that
is
goibniu
the
architect
and
marvellous
tales
current
all
over
ireland
attest
his
prowess

many
a
tale
yet
lingers
in
the
of
the

how
he
cleft

down

led

of

especially
were
the
attributed
to
him
and
the
christian
clerics
appropriated
his
popularity
by
describing
him
as
having
been
the
designer
of
their
churches
he
used
according
to
legend
to
wander
over
the
country

lips
of
old
people
in
remote
parts
of
ireland
some
of
these
are
as
might
have
been
expected
nothing
more
than
recollections
of
the
ancient
mythology
in
them
appear
as
characters
others
of
the
old
yet
not
quite
forgotten
manannán
and
still
remembered
as
those
of
druids
heroes
and
kings
of
ireland
in
the
misty
olden
time
one
or
two
of
them
are
worth
william
larminie
collecting
in
achill
island
took
one
from
the
lips
of
an
aged
peasant
which
tells
in
its
confused
way
what
might
almost
be
called
the
central
incident
of
gaelic
mythology
the
mysterious
birth
of
the
from
demoniac
parentage
and
his
eventual
slaying
of
his
grandfather
when
he
came
to
full
age
gobhan
the
architect
and
his
son
young
gobhan
runs
the
tale
were
sent
for
by
balor
of
the
blows
to
build
him
a
palace
they
built
it
so
well
that
balor
decided
never
to
let
them
leave
his
kingdom
alive
for
fear
they
should
build
another
one
equally
good
for
someone
else
he
therefore
had
all
the
scaffolding
removed
from
round
the
palace
while
they
were
still
on
the
top
with
the
intention
of
leaving
them
up
there
to
die
of
hunger
but
when
they
discovered
this
they
began
to
destroy
the
roof
so
that
balor
was
obliged
to
let
them
come
down
he
none
the
less
refused
to
allow
them
to
return
to
ireland
the
crafty
gobhan
however
had
his
plan
ready
he
told
balor
that
the
injury
that
had
been
done
to
the
palace
roof
could
not
be
repaired
without
special
tools
which
he
had
left
behind
him
at
home
balor
declined
to
let
either
old
gobhan
or
young
gobhan
go
back
to
fetch
them
but
he
offered
to
send
his
own
son
gobhan
gave
son
directions
for
the
journey
he
was
to
travel
until
he
came
to
a
house
with
a
stack
of
corn
at
the
door
entering
it
he
would
find
a
woman
with
one
hand
and
a
child
with
one
eye
son
found
the
house
and
asked
the
woman
for
the
tools
she
expected
him
for
it
had
been
arranged
between
gobhan
and
his
wife
what
should
be
done
if
balor
refused
to
let
him
return
she
took
son
to
a
huge
chest
and
told
him
that
the
tools
were
at
the
bottom
of
it
so
far
down
that
she
could
not
reach
them
and
that
he
must
get
into
the
chest
and
pick
them
up
himself
but
as
soon
as
he
was
safely
inside
she
shut
the
lid
on
him
telling
him
that
he
would
have
to
stay
there
until
his
father
allowed
old
gobhan
and
young
gobhan
to
come
home
with
their
pay
and
she
sent
the
same
message
to
balor
himself
there
was
an
exchange
of
prisoners
balor
giving
the
two
gobhans
their
pay
and
a
ship
to
take
them
home
and
wife
releasing
son
but
before
the
two
builders
went
balor
asked
them
whom
he
should
now
employ
to
repair
his
palace
old
gobhan
told
him
that
next
to
himself
there
was
no
workman
in
ireland
better
than
one
gavidjeen
go
when
gobhan
got
back
to
ireland
he
sent
gavidjeen
go
to
balor
but
he
gave
him
a
piece
of
accept
as
pay
only
one
thing
gray
cow
which
would
fill
twenty
barrels
at
one
milking
balor
agreed
to
this
but
when
he
gave
the
cow
to
gavidjeen
go
to
take
back
with
him
to
ireland
he
omitted
to
include
her
which
was
the
only
thing
that
would
keep
her
from
returning
to
her
original
owner
the
gray
cow
gave
so
much
trouble
to
gavidjeen
go
by
her
straying
that
he
was
obliged
to
hire
military
champions
to
watch
her
during
the
day
and
bring
her
safely
home
at
night
the
bargain
made
was
that
gavidjeen
go
should
forge
the
champion
a
sword
for
his
pay
but
that
if
he
lost
the
cow
his
life
was
to
be
forfeited
at
last
a
certain
warrior
called
cian
was
unlucky
enough
to
let
the
cow
escape
he
followed
her
tracks
down
to
the
and
right
to
the
edge
of
the
waves
and
there
he
lost
them
altogether
he
was
tearing
his
hair
in
his
perplexity
when
he
saw
a
man
rowing
a
coracle
the
man
who
was
no
other
than
manannán
son
of
lêr
came
in
close
to
the
shore
and
asked
what
was
the
matter
cian
told
him
would
you
give
to
anyone
who
would
take
you
to
the
place
where
the
gray
cow
is
asked
manannán
have
nothing
to
give
replied
cian
i
ask
said
manannán
half
of
whatever
you
gain
before
you
come
cian
agreed
to
that
willingly
enough
and
manannán
told
him
to
get
into
the
coracle
in
the
wink
of
an
eye
he
had
landed
him
in
kingdom
the
realm
of
the
cold
where
they
roast
no
meat
but
eat
their
food
raw
cian
was
not
used
to
this
diet
so
he
lit
himself
a
fire
and
began
to
cook
some
food
balor
saw
the
fire
and
came
down
to
it
and
he
was
so
pleased
that
he
appointed
cian
to
be
his
and
cook
now
balor
had
a
daughter
of
whom
a
druid
had
prophesied
that
she
would
some
day
bear
a
son
who
would
kill
his
grandfather
therefore
like
acrisius
in
greek
legend
he
shut
her
up
in
a
tower
guarded
by
women
and
allowed
her
to
see
no
man
but
himself
one
day
cian
saw
balor
go
to
the
tower
he
waited
until
he
had
come
back
and
then
went
to
explore
he
had
the
gift
of
opening
locked
doors
and
shutting
them
again
after
him
when
he
got
inside
he
lit
a
fire
and
this
novelty
so
delighted
daughter
that
she
invited
him
to
visit
her
again
after
the
achill
quaint
was
ever
coming
there
until
a
child
happened
to
daughter
gave
the
baby
to
cian
to
take
away
she
also
gave
him
the
which
belonged
to
the
gray
cow
cian
was
in
great
danger
now
for
balor
had
found
out
about
the
child
he
led
the
gray
cow
away
with
the
rope
to
the
and
waited
for
manannán
the
son
of
lêr
had
told
cian
that
when
he
was
in
any
difficulty
he
was
to
think
of
him
and
he
would
at
once
appear
cian
thought
of
him
now
and
in
a
moment
manannán
appeared
with
his
coracle
cian
got
into
the
boat
with
the
baby
and
the
gray
cow
just
as
balor
in
hot
pursuit
came
down
to
the
beach
balor
by
his
incantations
raised
a
great
storm
to
drown
them
but
manannán
whose
druidism
was
greater
stilled
it
then
balor
turned
the
sea
into
fire
to
burn
them
but
manannán
put
it
out
with
a
stone
when
they
were
safe
back
in
ireland
manannán
asked
cian
for
his
promised
reward
have
gained
nothing
but
the
boy
and
i
can
not
cut
him
in
two
so
i
will
give
him
to
you
whole
he
replied
is
what
i
was
wanting
all
the
time
said
manannán
he
grows
up
there
will
be
no
champion
equal
to
so
manannán
baptized
the
boy
calling
him
this
name
meaning
is
certainly
a
curious
corruption
of
the
original
of
all
when
the
boy
had
grown
up
he
went
one
day
to
the
a
ship
came
past
in
which
was
a
man
the
traditions
of
donnybrook
fair
are
evidently
prehistoric
for
the
boy
without
troubling
to
ask
who
the
stranger
was
took
a
dart
of
his
hurled
it
and
hit
him
the
man
in
the
boat
happened
to
be
balor
thus
in
accordance
with
the
prophecy
he
was
slain
by
his
grandson
who
though
the
folktale
does
not
name
him
was
obviously
lugh
another
version
of
the
same
legend
collected
by
the
irish
scholar
on
the
coast
of
donegal
opposite
balor
s
favourite
haunt
tory
island
is
interesting
as
completing
the
one
just
narrated
in
this
goibniu
is
called
gavida
and
is
made
one
of
three
brothers
the
other
two
being
called
mac
kineely
and
mac
samthainn
they
were
chiefs
of
donegal
smiths
and
farmers
while
balor
was
a
robber
who
harassed
the
mainland
from
his
stronghold
on
tory
island
the
gray
cow
belonged
to
mac
kineely
and
balor
stole
it
its
owner
determined
to
be
revenged
and
knowing
the
prediction
concerning
death
at
the
hands
of
an
as
yet
unborn
grandson
he
persuaded
a
kindly
fairy
to
spirit
him
in
female
disguise
to
tor
mor
where
daughter
who
was
called
ethnea
was
kept
imprisoned
the
result
of
this
expedition
was
not
merely
the
one
son
necessary
to
fulfil
the
prophecy
but
three
this
apparent
superfluity
was
fortunate
for
balor
drowned
two
of
them
the
other
being
picked
out
of
the
sea
by
the
same
fairy
who
had
been
incidentally
responsible
for
his
birth
and
handed
over
to
his
father
mac
kineely
to
be
brought
up
shortly
after
this
balor
managed
to
capture
mac
kineely
and
in
retaliation
for
the
wrong
done
him
chopped
off
his
head
upon
a
large
white
stone
still
known
locally
as
the
of
satisfied
with
this
and
quite
unaware
that
one
of
his
children
had
been
saved
from
death
and
was
now
being
brought
up
as
a
smith
by
gavida
balor
went
on
with
his
career
of
robbery
varying
it
by
visits
to
the
forge
to
purchase
arms
one
day
being
there
during
absence
he
began
boasting
to
the
young
assistant
of
how
he
had
compassed
mac
death
he
never
finished
the
story
for
was
the
a
iron
from
the
fire
and
thrust
it
into
eye
and
through
his
head
thus
in
these
two
gathered
in
different
parts
of
ireland
at
different
times
by
different
persons
survives
quite
a
mass
of
mythological
detail
only
to
be
found
otherwise
in
ancient
manuscripts
containing
still
more
ancient
matter
crystallized
in
them
may
be
found
the
names
of
six
members
of
the
old
gaelic
pantheon
each
filling
the
same
part
as
of
old
goibniu
has
not
lost
his
mastery
of
smithcraft
balor
is
still
the
fomorian
king
of
the
cold
regions
of
the
sea
his
daughter
ethniu
becomes
by
cian
the
mother
of
the
lugh
who
still
bears
his
old
title
of
though
it
is
strangely
corrupted
into
a
name
meaning
almost
the
exact
opposite
is
still
fostered
by
manannán
son
of
the
sea
and
in
the
end
grows
up
to
destroy
his
grandfather
by
a
blow
in
the
one
vulnerable
place
his
eye
perhaps
too
we
may
claim
to
see
a
genuine
though
jumbled
tradition
in
the
deformities
of
wife
and
child
and
in
the
story
of
the
gray
cow
and
her
which
recalls
that
of
the
heifer
ocean
the
memories
of
the
peasantry
still
hold
many
stories
of
lugh
as
well
as
of
angus
and
others
of
the
old
gods
but
next
to
the
gobhan
saer
the
one
whose
fame
is
still
greatest
is
that
and
figure
the
great
manannán
the
last
perhaps
to
receive
open
adoration
he
is
represented
by
kindly
tradition
as
having
been
still
content
to
help
and
watch
over
the
people
who
had
rejected
and
ceased
to
worship
him
up
to
the
time
of
columba
he
was
the
special
guardian
of
irishmen
in
foreign
parts
assisting
them
in
their
dangers
and
bringing
them
home
safe
for
the
peasantry
too
he
caused
favourable
weather
and
good
crops
his
fairy
subjects
tilled
the
ground
while
men
slept
but
this
is
said
to
have
come
to
an
end
at
last
saint
columba
having
broken
his
golden
chalice
gave
it
to
a
servant
to
get
repaired
on
his
way
the
servant
was
met
by
a
stranger
who
asked
him
where
he
was
going
the
man
told
him
and
showed
him
the
chalice
the
stranger
breathed
upon
it
and
at
once
the
broken
parts
reunited
then
he
begged
him
to
return
to
his
master
give
him
the
chalice
and
tell
him
that
manannán
son
of
lêr
who
had
mended
it
desired
to
know
in
very
truth
whether
he
would
ever
attain
paradise
said
the
ungrateful
saint
is
no
forgiveness
for
a
man
who
does
such
works
as
this
the
servant
went
back
with
the
answer
and
manannán
when
he
heard
it
broke
out
into
indignant
lament
is
me
manannán
mac
lêr
for
years
helped
the
catholics
of
ireland
but
do
it
no
more
till
as
weak
as
water
go
to
the
gray
waves
in
the
highlands
of
and
there
he
remained
for
unless
the
charming
stories
of
miss
fiona
macleod
are
mere
beautiful
imaginings
and
nothing
more
he
is
not
unknown
even
among
the
solitary
shepherds
and
fishers
of
farthest
in
the
for
october
she
tells
how
an
old
man
of
fourscore
years
would
often
be
visited
in
his
shieling
by
a
tall
beautiful
stranger
with
a
crest
on
his
head
white
canna
blowing
in
the
wind
but
with
a
blueness
in
and
bright
cold
curling
flame
under
the
soles
of
his
the
man
told
him
many
things
and
prophesied
to
him
the
time
of
his
death
generally
the
hands
were
hidden
in
the
folds
of
the
white
cloak
he
wore
but
once
he
moved
to
touch
the
shepherd
who
saw
then
that
his
flesh
was
like
water
with
floating
among
the
bones
so
that
murdo
macian
knew
that
he
could
be
speaking
with
none
other
than
the
son
of
the
sea
nor
is
he
yet
quite
forgotten
in
his
own
island
of
man
of
which
local
tradition
says
he
was
the
first
inhabitant
he
is
also
described
as
its
king
who
kept
it
from
invasion
by
his
magic
he
would
cause
mists
to
rise
at
any
moment
and
conceal
the
island
and
by
the
same
glamour
he
could
make
one
man
seem
like
a
hundred
and
little
chips
of
wood
which
he
threw
into
the
water
to
appear
like
ships
of
war
it
is
no
wonder
that
he
held
his
kingdom
against
until
his
sway
was
ended
like
that
of
the
other
gaelic
gods
by
the
arrival
of
saint
patrick
after
this
he
seems
to
have
declined
into
a
traditionary
giant
who
used
to
leap
from
peel
castle
to
contrary
head
for
exercise
or
hurl
huge
rocks
upon
which
the
mark
of
his
hand
can
still
be
seen
it
is
said
that
he
took
no
tribute
from
his
subjects
or
worshippers
except
bundles
of
green
rushes
which
were
placed
every
midsummer
eve
upon
two
mountain
peaks
one
called
warrefield
in
olden
days
but
now
south
barrule
and
the
other
called
man
and
not
now
to
be
identified
his
grave
which
is
thirty
yards
long
is
pointed
out
close
to
peel
castle
the
most
curious
legend
connected
with
him
however
tells
us
that
he
had
three
legs
on
which
he
used
to
travel
at
a
great
pace
how
this
was
done
may
be
seen
from
the
arms
of
the
island
on
which
are
pictured
his
three
limbs
joined
together
and
spread
out
like
the
spokes
of
a
wheel
an
irish
tradition
tells
us
that
when
manannán
left
ireland
for
scotland
the
vacant
kingship
of
the
gods
or
fairies
was
taken
by
one
mac
moineanta
to
the
great
grief
of
those
who
had
known
manannán
perhaps
this
great
grief
led
to
mac
being
deposed
for
the
present
king
of
the
irish
fairies
is
finvarra
the
same
fionnbharr
to
whom
the
dagda
allotted
the
of
meadha
after
the
conquest
of
the
tuatha
dé
danann
by
the
milesians
and
who
takes
a
prominent
part
in
the
fenian
stories
so
great
is
the
persistence
of
tradition
in
ireland
that
this
hill
of
meadha
now
spelt
knockma
is
still
considered
to
be
the
abode
of
him
and
his
queen
onagh
numberless
stories
are
told
about
finvarra
including
of
course
that
very
favourite
celtic
tale
of
the
stolen
bride
and
her
recapture
from
the
fairies
by
the
siege
and
digging
up
of
the
in
which
she
was
held
prisoner
finvarra
like
mider
of
bri
leith
carried
away
a
human
wife
not
of
a
high
king
but
of
an
irish
lord
the
modern
eochaid
airem
having
heard
an
invisible
voice
tell
him
where
he
was
to
look
for
his
lost
bride
gathered
all
his
workmen
and
labourers
and
proceeded
to
demolish
knockma
every
day
they
almost
dug
it
up
but
every
night
the
breach
was
found
to
have
been
repaired
by
fairy
workmen
of
this
went
on
for
three
days
when
the
irish
lord
thought
of
the
device
of
sanctifying
the
work
of
excavation
by
sprinkling
the
earth
with
salt
needless
to
say
it
succeeded
finvarra
gave
back
the
bride
still
in
the
trance
into
which
he
had
thrown
her
and
the
deep
cut
into
the
fairy
hill
still
remains
to
furnish
proof
to
the
incredulous
finvarra
does
not
always
appear
however
in
such
unfriendly
guise
he
was
popularly
reputed
to
have
under
his
special
care
the
family
of
the
kirwans
of
castle
hacket
on
the
northern
slope
of
knockma
owing
to
his
benevolent
influence
the
castle
cellars
never
went
dry
nor
did
the
quality
of
the
wine
deteriorate
besides
the
finvarra
looked
after
the
stables
and
it
was
owing
to
the
exercise
that
he
and
his
fairy
followers
gave
the
horses
by
night
that
john
racers
were
so
often
successful
on
the
curragh
that
such
stories
could
have
passed
current
as
fact
which
they
undoubtedly
did
is
excellent
proof
of
how
late
and
how
completely
a
mythology
may
survive
among
the
uncultured
finvarra
rules
over
a
wide
realm
of
fairy
folk
many
of
these
again
have
their
own
vassal
chieftains
forming
a
tribal
hierarchy
such
as
must
have
existed
in
the
celtic
days
of
ireland
finvarra
and
onagh
are
high
king
and
queen
but
under
them
cliodna
is
tributary
queen
of
munster
and
rules
from
a
near
mallow
in
county
cork
while
under
her
again
are
aoibhinn
queen
of
the
fairies
of
north
munster
and
ainé
queen
of
the
fairies
of
south
munster
these
names
form
but
a
single
instance
a
map
of
fairy
ireland
could
without
much
difficulty
be
drawn
showing
with
almost
political
exactness
the
various
kingdoms
of
the
sídhe
far
less
easy
however
would
be
the
task
of
ascertaining
the
origin
and
lineage
of
these
fabled
beings
some
of
them
can
still
be
traced
as
older
gods
and
goddesses
in
the
eastern
parts
of
ireland
badb
and
her
sisters
have
become
who
wail
over
deaths
not
necessarily
found
in
battle
aynia
deemed
the
most
powerful
fairy
in
ulster
and
ainé
queen
of
south
munster
are
perhaps
the
same
person
the
mysterious
and
awful
goddess
once
adored
as
anu
or
danu
of
the
two
it
is
ainé
who
especially
seems
to
carry
on
the
traditions
of
the
older
anu
worshipped
according
to
the
of
in
munster
as
a
goddess
of
prosperity
and
abundance
within
living
memory
she
was
propitiated
by
a
magical
ritual
upon
every
saint

to
ensure
fertility
during
the
coming
year
the
villagers
round

burning
bunches
of

upon
poles
to
the
top
of
the
hill
and
thence
dispersed
among
the
fields
waving
these
torches
over
the
crops
and
cattle
this
fairy
or
goddess
was
held
to
be
friendly
and
indeed
more
than
friendly
to
men
whether
or
not
she
were
the
mother
of
the
gods

is
claimed
as
first

half
a

the

warned
her

anything

by
their

a
wonderful
feat
which
he
performed
made
the
earl
break
this
condition
and

obliged
by
fairy
law
to
leave
him
but
though
she
had
lost
her

she
was
not

from

after

the
gods
of
the
britons
the
descriptions
and
the
stories
of
the
british
gods
have
hardly
come
down
to
us
in
so
ample
or
so
compact
a
form
as
those
of
the
deities
of
the
gaels
as
they
are
preserved
in
the
irish
and
scottish
manuscripts
they
have
also
suffered
far
more
from
the
sophistications
of
the
euhemerist
only
in
the
branches
of
the
do
the
gods
of
the
britons
appear
in
anything
like
their
real
character
of
supernatural
beings
masters
of
magic
and
untrammelled
by
the
limitations
which
hedge
in
mortals
apart
from
those
four
fragments
of
mythology
and
from
a
very
few
scattered
references
in
the
early
welsh
poems
one
must
search
for
them
under
strange
disguises
some
masquerade
as
kings
in
geoffrey
of
more
than
apocryphal
others
have
received
an
undeserved
canonization
which
must
be
stripped
from
them
before
they
can
be
seen
in
their
true
colours
others
again
were
adopted
by
the
romancers
and
turned
into
the
champions
of
chivalry
now
known
as
knights
of
the
round
table
but
however
disguised
their
real
nature
can
still
be
discerned
the
gaels
and
the
britons
were
but
two
branches
of
one
celtic
in
many
of
the
gods
of
the
britons
we
shall
recognize
with
names
alike
and
attributes
the
same
the
familiar
features
of
the
gaelic
tuatha
dé
danann
the
british
gods
are
sometimes
described
as
divided
into
three
of
the
of
and
the
of
but
these
three
families
are
really
only
two
for
nudd
or
lludd
as
he
is
variously
called
is
himself
described
as
a
son
of
beli
who
was
the
husband
of
the
goddess
dôn
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
dôn
herself
is
the
same
divine
personage
as
danu
the
mother
of
the
tuatha
dé
danann
and
that
beli
is
the
british
equivalent
of
the
gaelic
bilé
the
universal
dis
pater
who
sent
out
the
first
gaels
from
hades
to
take
possession
of
ireland
with
the
other
family
the
of
we
are
equally
on
familiar
ground
for
the
british
llyr
can
be
none
other
than
the
gaelic
lêr
these
two
families
or
tribes
are
usually
regarded
as
in
opposition
and
their
struggles
seem
to
symbolize
in
british
myth
that
same
conflict
between
the
powers
of
heaven
light
and
life
and
of
the
sea
darkness
and
death
which
are
shadowed
in
gaelic
mythology
in
the
battles
between
the
tuatha
dé
danann
and
the
fomors
for
the
children
of
dôn
were
certainly
gods
of
the
sky
their
names
are
writ
large
in
heaven
the
glittering
w
which
we
call
was
to
our
british
ancestors
or
our
was
the
of
daughter
while
the
was
the
of
son
more
than
this
the
greatest
of
her
children
the
nudd
or
lludd
whom
some
make
the
head
of
a
dynasty
of
his
own
was
the
zeus
alike
of
the
britons
and
of
the
gaels
his
epithet
of
that
is
the
hand
of
proves
him
the
same
personage
as
nuada
the
the
legend
which
must
have
existed
to
explain
this
peculiarity
has
been
lost
on
british
ground
but
it
was
doubtless
the
same
as
that
told
of
the
irish
god
with
it
and
no
doubt
much
else
has
disappeared
any
direct
account
of
battles
fought
by
him
as
against
enemies
but
under
the
faint
disguise
of
a
king
of
britain
an
ancient
welsh
tale
records
how
he
put
an
end
to
three
supernatural
which
oppressed
his
country
in
addition
to
this
we
find
him
under
his
name
of
nudd
described
in
a
welsh
triad
as
one
of
three
generous
heroes
of
the
isle
of
while
another
makes
him
the
owner
of
thousand
milch
expression
which
must
to
the
primitive
mind
have
implied
inexhaustible
wealth
both
help
us
to
the
conception
of
a
god
of
heaven
and
battle
triumphant
and
therefore
rich
and
liberal
more
tangible
evidence
is
however
not
lacking
to
prove
the
nature
of
his
worship
a
temple
dedicated
to
him
in
roman
times
under
the
name
of
nodens
or
nudens
has
been
discovered
at
lydney
on
the
banks
of
the
severn
the
god
is
pictured
on
a
plaque
of
bronze
as
a
youthful
deity
haloed
like
the
sun
and
driving
a
chariot
flying
spirits
typifying
the
winds
accompany
him
while
his
power
over
the
sea
is
symbolized
by
attendant
tritons
this
was
in
the
west
of
britain
while
in
the
east
there
is
good
reason
to
believe
that
he
had
a
shrine
overlooking
the
thames
tradition
declares
that
cathedral
occupies
the
site
of
an
ancient
pagan
temple
while
the
spot
on
which
it
stands
was
called
we
know
from
geoffrey
of
monmouth
by
the
britons
and
by
the
saxons
great
however
as
he
probably
was
lludd
or
nudd
occupies
less
space
in
welsh
story
as
we
have
it
now
than
his
son
gwyn
ap
nudd
has
outlived
in
tradition
almost
all
his
supernatural
kin
professor
rhys
is
tempted
to
see
in
him
the
british
equivalent
of
the
gaelic
finn
mac
cumhail
the
name
of
both
alike
means
both
are
sons
of
the
both
are
famed
as
hunters
gwyn
however
is
more
than
that
for
his
game
is
man
in
the
early
welsh
poems
he
is
a
god
of
battle
and
of
the
dead
and
as
such
fills
the
part
of
a
conducting
the
slain
into
hades
and
there
ruling
over
them
in
later
story
he
is
described
as
son
of
nudd
whom
god
has
placed
over
the
brood
of
devils
in
annwn
lest
they
should
destroy
the
present
race
later
again
as
paganism
still
further
degenerated
he
came
to
be
considered
as
king
of
the
the
welsh
fairies
and
his
name
as
such
has
hardly
yet
died
out
of
his
last
haunt
the
romantic
vale
of
neath
he
is
the
wild
huntsman
of
wales
and
the
west
of
england
and
it
is
his
pack
which
is
sometimes
heard
at
chase
in
waste
places
by
night
in
his
earliest
guise
as
a
god
of
war
and
death
he
is
the
subject
of
a
poem
in
dialogue
contained
in
the
black
book
of
caermarthen
obscure
like
most
of
the
ancient
welsh
poems
it
is
yet
a
spirited
production
and
may
be
quoted
here
as
a
favourable
specimen
of
the
poetry
of
the
early
cymri
in
it
we
shall
see
mirrored
perhaps
the
clearest
figure
of
the
british
pantheon
the
not
of
deer
but
of
souls
riding
his
demon
horse
and
cheering
on
his
demon
hound
to
the
fearful
chase
he
knows
when
and
where
all
the
great
warriors
fell
for
he
gathered
their
souls
upon
the
field
of
battle
and
now
rules
over
them
in
hades
or
upon
some
it
describes
a
mythical
prince
named
gwyddneu
garanhir
known
to
welsh
legend
as
the
ruler
of
a
lost
country
now
covered
by
the
waters
of
cardigan
bay
asking
protection
of
the
god
who
accords
it
and
then
relates
the
story
of
his
exploits
a
bull
of
conflict
was
he
active
in
dispersing
an
arrayed
army
the
ruler
of
hosts
indisposed
to
anger
blameless
and

conduct
in

a
line
in
this
poem
allows
us
to
see
gwyn
in
another
and
less
sinister
rôle
lover
of
creurdilad
the
daughter
of
lludd
he
calls
himself
and
an
episode
in
the
mythical
romance
of
and
preserved
in
the
red
book
of
hergest
gives
the
details
of
his
courtship
gwyn
had
as
rival
a
deity
called
gwyrthur
ap
greidawl
that
is
son
of
these
two
waged
perpetual
war
for
creurdilad
or
creudylad
each
in
turn
stealing
her
from
the
other
until
the
matter
was
referred
to
arthur
who
decided
that
creudylad
should
be
sent
back
to
her
father
and
that
gwyn
and
gwyrthur
fight
for
her
every
first
of
may
from
henceforth
until
the
day
of
doom
and
that
whichever
of
them
should
then
be
conqueror
should
have
the
what
satisfaction
this
would
be
to
the
survivor
of
what
might
be
somewhat
flippantly
described
as
in
two
senses
the
longest
engagement
on
record
is
not
very
clear
but
its
mythological
interpretation
appears
fairly
obvious
in
gwyn
god
of
death
and
the
underworld
and
in
the
solar
deity
gwyrthur
we
may
see
the
powers
of
darkness
and
sunshine
of
winter
and
summer
in
contest
each
alternately
winning
and
losing
a
bride
who
would
seem
to
represent
the
spring
with
its
grain
and
flowers
creudylad
whom
the
story
of
and
calls
most
splendid
maiden
in
the
three
islands
of
the
mighty
and
in
the
three
islands
is
in
fact
the
british
persephoné
as
the
daughter
of
lludd
she
is
child
of
the
shining
sky
but
a
different
tradition
must
have
made
her
a
daughter
of
llyr
the
for
her
name
as
such
passed
through
geoffrey
of
monmouth
to
shakespeare
in
whose
hands
she
became
that
pathetic
figure
cordelia
in
it
may
not
be
altogether
unworthy
of
notice
though
perhaps
it
is
only
a
coincidence
that
in
some
myths
the
greek
persephoné
is
made
a
daughter
of
zeus
and
in
others
of
poseidon
turning
from
the
and
his
son
we
find
others
of
children
to
have
been
the
exponents
of
those
arts
of
life
which
early
races
held
to
have
been
taught
directly
by
the
gods
to
men
dôn
herself
had
a
brother
mâth
son
of
a
mysterious
mâthonwy
and
recognizable
as
a
benevolent
ruler
of
the
underworld
akin
to
beli
or
perhaps
that
god
himself
under
another
title
for
the
name
mâth
which
means
money
recalls
that
of
plouton
the
greek
god
of
hades
in
his
guise
of
possessor
and
giver
of
metals
it
was
a
belief
common
to
the
aryan
races
that
wisdom
as
well
as
wealth
came
originally
from
the
underworld
and
we
find
mâth
represented
in
the
mabinogi
bearing
his
name
as
handing
on
his
magical
lore
to
his
nephew
and
pupil
gwydion
who
there
is
good
reason
to
believe
was
the
same
divine
personage
whom
the
teutonic
tribes
worshipped
as
and
thus
equipped
gwydion
son
of
dôn
became
the
druid
of
the
gods
the
of
illusion
and
and
not
only
that
but
the
teacher
of
all
that
is
useful
and
good
the
friend
and
helper
of
mankind
and
the
perpetual
fighter
against
niggardly
underworld
powers
for
the
good
gifts
which
they
refused
to
allow
out
of
their
keeping
shoulder
to
shoulder
with
him
in
this
of
culture
against
ignorance
and
light
against
darkness
stood
his
brothers
amaethon
god
of
agriculture
and
govannan
a
god
of
smithcraft
identical
with
the
gaelic
giobniu
he
had
also
a
sister
called
arianrod
or
who
as
is
common
in
mythologies
was
not
only
his
sister
but
also
his
wife
so
zeus
wedded
heré
and
indeed
it
is
difficult
to
say
where
otherwise
the
partners
of
gods
are
to
come
from
of
this
connection
two
sons
were
born
at
one
and
lleu
who
are
considered
as
representing
the
twin
powers
of
darkness
and
light
with
darkness
the
sea
was
inseparably
connected
by
the
celts
and
as
soon
as
the
dark
twin
was
born
and
named
he
plunged
headlong
into
his
native
element
immediately
when
he
was
in
the
sea
says
the
mabinogi
of
mâth
son
of
mâthonwy
took
its
nature
and
swam
as
well
as
the
best
fish
that
was
therein
and
for
that
reason
was
he
called
dylan
the
son
of
the
wave
beneath
him
no
wave
ever
he
was
killed
with
a
spear
at
last
by
his
uncle
govannan
and
according
to
the
bard
taliesin
the
waves
of
britain
ireland
scotland
and
the
isle
of
man
wept
for
him
beautiful
legends
grew
up
around
his
death
the
clamour
of
the
waves
dashing
upon
the
beach
is
the
expression
of
their
longing
to
avenge
their
son
the
sound
of
the
sea
rushing
up
the
mouth
of
the
river
conway
is
still
known
as
a
small
promontory
on
the
carnarvonshire
side
of
the
menai
straits
called
maen
or
maen
preserves
his
name
the
other
child
of
gwydion
and
arianrod
grew
up
to
become
the
british
lleu
llaw
gyffes
the
exact
counterpart
of
the
gaelic
lugh
lamhfada
the
like
all
solar
deities
his
growth
was
rapid
when
he
was
a
year
old
he
seemed
to
be
two
years
at
the
age
of
two
he
travelled
by
himself
and
when
he
was
four
years
old
he
was
as
tall
as
a
boy
of
eight
and
was
his
constant
companion
one
day
gwydion
took
him
to
the
castle
of
her
castle
in
the
sky
but
her
abode
on
earth
the
site
of
which
is
marked
by
a
patch
of
rocks
in
the
menai
straits
accessible
without
a
boat
only
during
the
lowest
spring
and
autumn
tides
arianrod
had
disowned
her
son
and
did
not
recognize
him
when
she
saw
him
with
gwydion
she
asked
who
he
was
and
was
much
displeased
when
told
she
demanded
to
know
his
name
and
when
gwydion
replied
that
he
had
as
yet
received
none
she
a
destiny
him
after
the
fashion
of
the
celts
that
he
should
be
without
a
name
until
she
chose
to
bestow
one
on
him
herself
to
be
without
a
name
was
a
very
serious
thing
to
the
ancient
britons
who
seem
to
have
held
the
primitive
theory
that
the
name
and
the
soul
are
the
same
so
gwydion
cast
about
to
think
by
what
craft
he
might
extort
from
arianrod
some
remark
from
which
he
could
name
their
son
the
next
day
he
went
down
to
the
with
the
boy
both
of
them
disguised
as
cordwainers
he
made
a
boat
out
of
by
magic
and
some
leather
out
of
some
dry
sticks
and
sedges
then
they
sailed
the
boat
to
the
port
of
castle
and
anchoring
it
where
it
could
be
seen
began
ostentatiously
to
stitch
away
at
the
leather
naturally
they
were
soon
noticed
and
arianrod
sent
someone
out
to
see
who
they
were
and
what
they
were
doing
when
she
found
that
they
were
shoemakers
she
remembered
that
she
wanted
some
shoes
gwydion
though
he
had
her
measure
purposely
made
them
first
too
large
and
then
too
small
this
brought
arianrod
herself
down
to
the
boat
to
be
fitted
while
gwydion
was
measuring
foot
for
the
shoes
a
wren
came
and
stood
upon
the
deck
the
boy
took
his
bow
and
arrow
and
hit
the
wren
in
the
favourite
shot
of
celtic
archers
at
any
rate
in
romance
the
goddess
was
pleased
to
be
amiable
and
complimentary
said
she
lion
aimed
at
it
with
a
steady
it
is
from
such
incidents
that
primitive
people
take
their
names
all
the
world
over
the
boy
had
got
his
is
no
thanks
to
you
said
gwydion
to
arianrod
now
he
has
a
name
and
a
good
name
it
is
he
shall
be
called
llew
llaw
gyffes
this
name
of
the
is
a
good
example
of
how
obsolete
the
ancient
pagan
tradition
had
become
before
it
was
put
into
writing
the
old
word
meaning
had
passed
out
of
use
and
the
scribe
substituted
for
a
name
that
was
unintelligible
to
him
one
like
it
which
he
knew
namely
meaning
the
word
seems
also
to
have
suffered
change
and
to
have
meant
originally
not
but
at
any
rate
arianrod
was
defeated
in
her
design
to
keep
her
son
nameless
neither
did
she
even
get
her
shoes
for
as
soon
as
he
had
gained
his
object
gwydion
allowed
the
boat
to
change
back
into
and
the
leather
to
return
to
sedge
and
sticks
so
in
her
anger
she
put
a
fresh
destiny
on
the
boy
that
he
should
not
take
arms
till
she
herself
gave
them
him
gwydion
however
took
lleu
to
dinas
dinllev
his
castle
which
still
stands
at
the
edge
of
the
menai
straits
and
brought
him
up
as
a
warrior
as
soon
as
he
thought
him
old
enough
to
have
arms
he
took
him
with
him
again
to
caer
arianrod
this
time
they
were
disguised
as
bards
arianrod
received
them
gladly
heard
songs
and
tales
feasted
them
and
prepared
a
room
for
them
to
sleep
in
the
next
morning
gwydion
got
up
very
early
and
prepared
his
most
powerful
incantations
by
his
druidical
arts
he
made
it
seem
as
if
the
whole
country
rang
with
the
shouts
and
trumpets
of
an
army
and
he
put
a
glamour
over
everyone
so
that
they
saw
the
bay
filled
with
ships
arianrod
came
to
him
in
terror
asking
what
could
be
done
to
protect
the
castle
us
arms
he
replied
we
will
do
the
best
we
so
maidens
armed
gwydion
while
arianrod
herself
put
arms
on
lleu
by
the
time
she
had
finished
all
the
noises
had
ceased
and
the
ships
had
vanished
us
take
our
arms
off
again
said
gwydion
shall
not
need
them
the
army
is
all
round
the
castle
cried
arianrod
was
no
army
answered
gwydion
was
only
an
illusion
of
mine
to
cause
you
to
break
your
prophecy
and
give
our
son
arms
and
now
he
has
got
them
without
thanks
to
i
will
lay
a
worse
destiny
on
him
cried
the
infuriated
goddess
shall
never
have
a
wife
of
the
people
of
this
shall
have
a
wife
in
spite
of
you
said
gwydion
so
gwydion
went
to
mâth
his
uncle
and
tutor
in
magic
and
between
them
they
made
a
woman
out
of
flowers
by
charms
and
illusion
took
the
blossoms
of
the
oak
and
the
blossoms
of
the
broom
and
the
blossoms
of
the
and
produced
from
them
a
maiden
the
fairest
and
most
graceful
that
man
ever
they
called
her
blodeuwedd
and
gave
her
to
lleu
as
his
wife
and
they
gave
lleu
a
palace
called
mur
y
castell
near
bala
lake
all
went
well
until
one
day
gronw
pebyr
one
of
the
gods
of
darkness
came
by
hunting
and
killed
the
stag
at
nightfall
near
castle
the
was
away
upon
a
visit
to
mâth
but
blodeuwedd
asked
the
stranger
to
take
shelter
with
her
that
night
they
fell
in
love
with
one
another
and
conspired
together
how
lleu
might
be
put
away
when
lleu
came
back
from
court
blodeuwedd
like
a
celtic
dalilah
wormed
out
of
him
the
secret
of
how
his
life
was
preserved
he
told
her
that
he
could
only
die
in
one
way
he
could
not
be
killed
either
inside
or
outside
a
house
either
on
horseback
or
on
foot
but
that
if
a
spear
that
had
been
a
year
in
the
making
and
which
was
never
worked
upon
except
during
the
sacrifice
on
sunday
were
to
be
cast
at
him
as
he
stood
beneath
a
roof
of
thatch
after
having
just
bathed
with
one
foot
upon
the
edge
of
the
bath
and
the
other
upon
a
buck
back
it
would
cause
his
death
blodeuwedd
piously
thanked
heaven
that
he
was
so
well
protected
and
sent
a
messenger
to
her
paramour
telling
him
what
she
had
learned
gronw
set
to
work
on
the
spear
and
in
a
year
it
was
ready
when
she
knew
this
blodeuwedd
asked
lleu
to
show
her
exactly
how
it
was
he
could
be
killed
lleu
agreed
and
blodeuwedd
prepared
the
bath
under
the
thatched
roof
and
tethered
the
goat
by
it
lleu
bathed
and
then
stood
with
one
foot
upon
the
edge
of
the
bath
and
the
other
upon
the
back
at
this
moment
gronw
from
an
ambush
flung
the
spear
and
hit
lleu
who
with
a
terrible
cry
changed
into
an
eagle
and
flew
away
he
never
came
back
and
gronw
took
possession
of
both
his
wife
and
his
palace
but
gwydion
set
out
to
search
everywhere
for
his
son
at
last
one
day
he
came
to
a
house
in
north
wales
where
the
man
was
in
great
anxiety
about
his
sow
for
as
soon
as
the
sty
was
opened
every
morning
she
rushed
out
and
did
not
return
again
till
late
in
the
evening
gwydion
offered
to
follow
her
and
at
dawn
the
man
took
him
to
the
sty
and
opened
the
door
the
sow
leaped
forth
and
ran
and
gwydion
ran
after
her
he
tracked
her
to
a
brook
between
snowdon
and
the
sea
still
called
nant
y
llew
and
saw
her
feeding
underneath
an
oak
upon
the
top
of
the
tree
there
was
an
eagle
and
every
time
it
shook
itself
there
fell
off
it
lumps
of
putrid
meat
which
the
sow
ate
greedily
gwydion
suspected
that
the
eagle
must
be
lleu
so
he
sang
this
verse
that
grows
between
the
two
banks
darkened
is
the
sky
and
hill
shall
i
not
tell
him
by
his
wounds
that
this
is
lleu
the
eagle
on
hearing
this
came
down
the
tree
so
gwydion
sang
that
grows
in
upland
ground
is
it
not
wetted
by
the
rain
has
it
not
been
drenched
by
nine
score
tempests
it
bears
in
its
branches
lleu
llaw
the
eagle
came
slowly
down
until
it
was
on
the
lowest
branch
gwydion
sang
that
grows
beneath
the
steep
stately
and
majestic
is
its
aspect
shall
i
not
speak
it
that
lleu
will
come
to
my
lap
then
the
eagle
came
down
and
sat
on
knee
gwydion
struck
it
with
his
magic
wand
and
it
became
lleu
again
wasted
to
skin
and
bone
by
the
poison
on
the
spear
gwydion
took
him
to
mâth
to
be
healed
and
left
him
there
while
he

two

hardly

mentioning
them
were
it
not
for
the
wild
poetry
of
the
legend
connected
with
them
the
tale
put
into
writing
at
a
time
when
all
the
gods
were
being
transfigured
into
simple
mortals
tells
us
that
they
were
two
kings
of
britain
brothers
one
starlight
night
they
were
walking
together
said
nynniaw
to
peibaw
a
fine
field
i
is
it
asked
peibaw
replied
nynniaw
whole
stretch
of
the
sky
as
far
as
the
eye
then
returned
peibaw
a
number
of
cattle
i
have
grazing
on
your
are
they
asked
nynniaw
the
stars
that
you
can
see
replied
peibaw
one
of
them
of
gold
with
the
moon
for
a
shepherd
over
shall
not
feed
on
my
field
cried
nynniaw
shall
exclaimed
peibaw
shall
not
cried
nynniaw
shall
said
peibaw
shall
not
nynniaw
answered
and
so
they
went
on
from
contradiction
to
quarrel
and
from
private
quarrel
to
civil
war
until
the
armies
of
both
of
them
were
destroyed
and
the
two
authors
of
the
evil
were
turned
by
god
into
oxen
for
their
sins
last
of
the
children
of
dôn
we
find
a
goddess
called
penardun
of
whom
little
is
known
except
that
she
was
married
to
the
llyr
this
incident
is
curious
as
forming
a
parallel
to
the
gaelic
story
which
tells
of
intermarriage
between
the
tuatha
dé
danann
and
the
fomors
brigit
the
daughter
was
married
to
bress
son
of
elathan
while
cian
the
son
of
diancecht
wedded
ethniu
the
daughter
of
balor
so
in
this
kindred
mythology
a
slender
tie
of
relationship
binds
the
gods
of
the
sky
to
the
gods
of
the
sea
the
name
is
supposed
like
its
irish
equivalent
lêr
to
have
meant
the
british
is
undoubtedly
the
same
as
the
gaelic
indeed
the
two
facts
that
he
is
described
in
welsh
literature
as
llyr
llediath
that
is
of
the
foreign
and
is
given
a
wife
called
iweridd
ireland
suggest
that
he
may
have
been
borrowed
by
the
britons
from
the
gaels
later
than
any
mythology
common
to
both
as
a
british
god
he
was
the
original
of
the
chief
city
of
his
worship
is
still
called
after
him
leicester
that
is
in
still
earlier
days
caer
llyr
llyr
we
have
noticed
married
two
wives
penardun
and
iweridd
by
the
daughter
of
dôn
he
had
a
son
called
manawyddan
who
is
identical
with
the
gaelic
manannán
mac
lir
we
know
less
of
his
character
and
attributes
than
we
do
of
the
irish
god
but
we
find
him
equally
a
ruler
in
that
hades
or
elysium
which
the
celtic
mind
ever
connected
with
the
sea
like
all
the
inhabitants
of
that
other
world
he
is
at
once
a
master
of
magic
and
of
the
useful
arts
which
he
taught
willingly
to
his
friends
to
his
enemies
however
he
could
show
a
different
side
of
his
character
a
triad
tells
us
achievement
of
manawyddan
the
wise
after
lamentation
and
fiery
wrath
was
the
constructing
of
the
of
oeth
and
which
is
described
as
a
prison
made
in
the
shape
of
a
entirely
of
human
bones
mortared
together
and
divided
into
innumerable
cells
forming
a
kind
of
labyrinth
in
this
ghastly
place
he
immured
those
whom
he
found
trespassing
in
hades
and
among
his
captives
was
no
less
a
person
than
the
famous
arthur
bore
two
children
to
llyr
a
daughter
called
branwen
and
a
son
called
brân
the
little
we
know
of
branwen
of
the
shows
her
as
a
goddess
of
like
the
greek
aphrodité
of
the
sea
brân
on
the
other
hand
is
even
more
clearly
than
manawyddan
a
dark
deity
of
hades
he
is
represented
as
of
colossal
size
so
huge
in
fact
that
no
house
or
ship
was
big
enough
to
hold
him
he
delighted
in
battle
and
carnage
like
the
or
raven
from
which
he
probably
took
his
name
but
he
was
also
the
especial
patron
of
bards
minstrels
and
musicians
and
we
find
him
in
one
of
the
poems
ascribed
to
taliesin
claiming
to
be
himself
a
bard
a
harper
a
player
on
the
crowth
and
other
musicians
all
at
once
his
son
was
called
caradawc
the
who
as
the
british
mythology
crumbled
became
confounded
with
the
historical
caratacus
known
popularly
as
both
brân
and
manawyddan
were
especially
connected
with
the
swansea
peninsula
the
of
oeth
and
anoeth
was
placed
by
tradition
in
gower
that
brân
was
equally
at
home
there
may
be
proved
from
the
morte
darthur
in
which
storehouse
of
forgotten
and
misunderstood
mythology
brân
of
gower
survives
as
such
identification
of
a
mere
mortal
country
with
the
other
world
seems
strange
enough
to
us
but
to
our
celtic
ancestors
it
was
a
quite
natural
thought
all
peninsulas
which
viewed
from
an
opposite
coast
probably
seemed
to
them
deemed
to
be
homes
of
the
dark
powers
of
hades
difficult
of
access
protected
by
the
turbulent
and
dangerous
sea
sometimes
rendered
quite
invisible
by
fogs
and
mists
and
at
other
times
looming
up
ghostlily
on
the
horizon
often
held
by
the
remnant
of
a
hostile
lower
race
they
gained
a
mystery
and
a
sanctity
from
the
law
of
the
human
mind
which
has
always
held
the
unknown
to
be
the
terrible
the
cornish
britons
gazing
from
the
shore
saw
gower
and
lundy
and
deemed
them
outposts
of
the
other
world
to
the
britons
of
wales
ireland
was
no
human
realm
a
view
reciprocated
by
the
gaels
who
saw
hades
in
britain
while
the
isle
of
man
was
a
little
hades
common
to
them
both
nor
even
was
the
sea
always
necessary
to
sunder
the
world
of
ghosts
from
that
of
glastonbury
tor
surrounded
by
almost
impassable
swamps

one
of
the
especial
haunts
of
gwyn
ap
nudd
the
britons
of
the
north
held
that
beyond
the
roman
wall
and
the
vast
caledonian
wood
lived
ghosts
and
not

even
the
roman
province
of
by
the
welsh
dyfed
and
corresponding
roughly
to
the
modern
county
of
as
a
last
stronghold
of
the
aborigines
identified
with
the
mythic
underworld
as
such
dyfed
was
ruled
by
a
local
tribe
of
gods
whose
greatest
figures
were
pwyll
of
the
welsh
name
for
hades
with
his
wife
rhiannon
and
their
son
pryderi
these
beings
are
described
as
hostile
to
the
children
of
dôn
but
friendly
to
the
race
of
llyr
after
death
or
disappearance
his
widow
rhiannon
becomes
the
wife
of
manawyddan
in
a
poem
of
we
find
manawyddan
and
pryderi
of
hades
and
warders
of
that
magic
cauldron
of
inspiration
which
the
gods
of
light
attempted
to
steal
or
capture
and
which
became
famous
afterwards
as
the
another
of
their
treasures
were
the
birds
of
which
we
are
told
in
an
ancient
book
could
sing
the
dead
to
life
and
the
living
into
the
sleep
of
death
fortunately
they
sang
seldom
are
three
things
says
a
welsh
triad
are
not
often
heard
the
song
of
the
birds
of
rhiannon
a
song
of
wisdom
from
the
mouth
of
a
saxon
and
an
invitation
to
a
feast
from
a
nor
is
the
list
of
british
gods
complete
without
mention
of
arthur
though
most
readers
will
be
surprised
to
find
him
in
such
company
the
genius
of
tennyson
who
drew
his
materials
mostly
from
the
romances
has
stereotyped
the
popular
conception
of
arthur
as
a
king
of
early
britain
who
fought
for
his
fatherland
and
the
christian
faith
against
invading
saxons
possibly
there
may
indeed
have
been
a
powerful
british
chieftain
bearing
that
typically
celtic
name
which
is
found
in
irish
legend
as
artur
one
of
the
sons
of
nemed
who
fought
against
the
fomors
and
on
the
continent
as
artaius
a
gaulish
deity
whom
the
romans
identified
with
mercury
and
who
seems
to
have
been
a
patron
of
agriculture
but
the
original
arthur
stands
upon
the
same
ground
as
cuchulainn
and
finn
his
deeds
are
mythical
because
superhuman
his
companions
can
be
shown
to
have
been
divine
some
we
know
were
worshipped
in
gaul
others
are
children
of
dôn
of
llyr
and
of
pwyll
dynasties
of
older
gods
to
whose
head
arthur
seems
to
have
risen
as
his
cult
waxed
and
theirs
waned
stripped
of
their
godhead
and
strangely
transformed
they
fill
the
pages
of
romance
as
knights
of
the
table
round
these
deities
were
the
native
gods
of
britain
many
others
are
however
mentioned
upon
inscriptions
found
in
our
island
but
these
were
almost
all
exotic
and
imported
imperial
rome
brought
men
of
diverse
races
among
her
legions
and
these
men
brought
their
gods
scattered
over
britain
but
especially
in
the
north
near
the
wall
we
find
evidence
that
deities
of
many
germany
to
africa
and
from
gaul
to
sporadically
worshipped
most
of
these
foreign
gods
were
roman
but
a
temple
at
eboracum
now
york
was
dedicated
to
serapis
and
mithras
the
persian
was
also
adored
there
while
at
corbridge
in
northumberland
the
ancient
corspitium
there
have
been
found
altars
to
the
tyrian
hercules
and
to
astarte
the
was
also
invoked
under
many
strange
by
a
colony
of
dacians
in
cumberland
as
toutates
camulus
coritiacus
belatucador
alator
loucetius
condates
and
rigisamos
by
men
of
different
countries
a
goddess
of
war
was
worshipped
at
bath
under
the
name
of
nemetona
the
hot
springs
of
the
same
town
were
under
the
patronage
of
a
divinity
called
sul
identified
by
the
romans
with
minerva
and
she
was
helped
by
a
god
of
medicine
described
on
a
dedicatory
tablet
as
apollo
few
of
these
however
seem
to
have
taken
hold
of
the
imagination
of
the
native
britons
their
worshippers
did
not
proselytize
and
their
general
influence
was
probably
about
equal
to
that
of
an
evangelical
church
in
a
turkish
town
the
sole
exceptions
to
this
rule
are
where
the
foreign
gods
are
gaulish
but
in
several
instances
it
can
be
proved
that
they
were
not
so
much
of
roman
as
of
original
celtic
importation
the
warlike
camulus
appears
in
gaelic
heroic
myth
as
cumhal
the
father
of
finn
and
in
british
mythical
history
as
coel
a
duke
of
caer
coelvin
known
earlier
as
camulodunum
and
now
as
colchester
who
seized
the
crown
of
britain
and
spent
his
short
reign
in
a
series
of
battles
the
name
of
the
maponos
is
found
alike
upon
altars
in
gaul
and
britain
and
in
welsh
literature
as
mabon
a
follower
of
arthur
while
another
gaulish
belinus
who
had
a
splendid
temple
at
bajocassos
the
modern
bayeux
though
not
mentioned
in
the
earliest
british
mythology
as
its
scattered
records
have
come
down
to
us
must
have
been
connected
with
brân
for

as

an
account
of
a
god
of
eloquence
worshipped
in
gaul
under
the
name
of
ogmios

represented
as
equipped

heracles
a
description
which
exactly
corresponds
to
the
conception
of
the

of

and

strong
man
of
the

probably

nemon

brigantia
tutelary
goddess
of
the

a
northern
tribe

in

as
brigindo

in
a
common
heritage
of
mythological
names

the
adventures
of
the
gods
of
hades
it
is
with
the
family
of
pwyll
deities
connected
with
the
corner
of
wales
called
by
the
romans
demetia
and
by
the
britons
dyfed
and
roughly
speaking
identical
with
the
modern
county
of
pembrokeshire
that
the
earliest
consecutive
accounts
of
the
british
gods
begin
the
first
of
the
four
branches
of
the
mabinogi
tell
us
how
prince
of
gained
the
right
to
be
called
the
of
indeed
it
almost
seems
as
if
it
had
been
deliberately
written
to
explain
how
the
same
person
could
be
at
once
a
mere
mortal
prince
however
legendary
and
a
ruler
in
the
mystic
other
world
and
so
to
reconcile
two
conflicting
traditions
but
to
an
earlier
age
than
that
in
which
the
legend
was
put
into
a
literary
shape
such
forced
reconciliation
would
not
have
been
needed
for
the
two
legends
would
not
have
been
considered
to
conflict
when
pwyll
head
of
annwn
was
a
mythic
person
whose
tradition
was
still
alive
the
unexplored
rugged
and
savage
country
of
dyfed
populated
by
the
aboriginal
iberians
whom
the
celt
had
driven
into
such
remote
districts
appeared
to
those
who
dwelt
upon
the
eastern
side
of
its
dividing
river
the
tawë
at
least
a
dependency
of
annwn
if
not
that
weird
realm
itself
but
as
men
grew
bolder
the
frontier
was
crossed
and
dyfed
entered
and
traversed
and
found
to
be
not
so
unlike
other
countries
its
inhabitants
if
not
of
celtic
race
were
yet
of
flesh
and
blood
so
that
though
the
province
still
continued
to
bear
to
a
late
date
the
names
of
the
of
and
the
of
it
was
no
longer
deemed
to
be
hades
itself
that
fitful
and
shadowy
country
had
folded
its
tents
and
departed
over
or
under
seas
the
story
of
prince
of
tells
us
how
there
was
war
in
annwn
between
its
two
between
two
perhaps
of
its
many
chieftains
arawn
and
havgan
each
coveted
the
dominions
of
the
other
in
the
continual
contests
between
them
arawn
was
worsted
and
in
despair
he
visited
the
upper
earth
to
seek
for
a
mortal
ally
at
this
time
pwyll
prince
of
dyfed
held
his
court
at
narberth
he
had
however
left
his
capital
upon
a
hunting
expedition
to
glyn
cûch
known
as
a
valley
upon
the
borders
of
the
two
counties
of
pembroke
and
carmarthen
like
so
many
kings
of
european
and
oriental
romance
when
an
adventure
is
at
hand
he
became
separated
from
his
party
and
was
in
modern
parlance
he
could
however
still
hear
the
music
of
his
hounds
and
was
listening
to
them
when
he
also
distinguished
the
cry
of
another
pack
coming
towards
him
as
he
watched
and
listened
a
stag
came
into
view
and
the
strange
hounds
pulled
it
down
almost
at
his
feet
at
first
pwyll
hardly
looked
at
the
stag
he
was
so
taken
up
with
gazing
at
the
hounds
for
all
the
hounds
that
he
had
seen
in
the
world
he
had
never
seen
any
that
were
like
unto
these
for
their
hair
was
of
a
brilliant
shining
white
and
their
ears
were
red
and
as
the
whiteness
of
their
bodies
shone
so
did
the
redness
of
their
ears
they
were
indeed
though
pwyll
does
not
seem
to
have
known
it
of
the
true
hades
hounds
we
meet
in
gaelic
legends
and
which
are
still
said
to
be
sometimes
heard
and
seen
scouring
the
hills
of
wales
by
night
seeing
no
rider
with
the
hounds
pwyll
drove
them
away
from
the
dead
stag
and
called
up
his
own
pack
to
it
while
he
was
doing
this
a
man
a
large
steed
with
a
round
his
neck
and
clad
in
garments
of
gray
woollen
in
the
fashion
of
a
hunting
appeared
and
rated
pwyll
for
his
unsportsmanlike
conduct
discourtesy
said
he
never
saw
than
your
driving
away
my
dogs
after
they
had
killed
the
stag
and
calling
your
own
to
it
and
though
i
may
not
be
revenged
upon
you
for
this
i
swear
that
i
will
do
you
more
damage
than
the
value
of
a
hundred
pwyll
expressed
his
contrition
and
asking
the
name
and
rank
offered
to
atone
for
his
fault
the
stranger
told
his
a
king
of
said
that
pwyll
could
gain
his
forgiveness
only
in
one
way
by
going
to
annwn
instead
of
him
and
fighting
for
him
with
havgan
pwyll
agreed
to
do
this
and
the
king
of
hades
put
his
own
semblance
upon
the
mortal
prince
so
that
not
a
person
in
even
own
know
that
he
was
not
that
king
he
led
him
by
a
secret
path
into
annwn
and
left
him
before
his
castle
charging
him
to
return
to
the
place
where
they
had
first
met
at
the
end
of
a
year
from
that
day
on
the
other
hand
arawn
took
on
shape
and
went
to
narberth
no
one
in
annwn
suspected
pwyll
of
being
anyone
else
than
their
king
he
spent
the
year
in
ruling
the
realm
in
hunting
minstrelsy
and
feasting
both
by
day
and
night
he
had
the
company
of
wife
the
most
beautiful
woman
he
had
ever
yet
seen
but
he
refrained
from
taking
advantage
of
the
trust
placed
in
him
at
last
the
day
came
when
he
was
to
meet
havgan
in
single
combat
one
blow
settled
it
for
pwyll
destined
conqueror
thrust
his
antagonist
an
and
a
length
over
the
crupper
of
his
horse
breaking
his
shield
and
armour
and
mortally
wounding
him
havgan
was
carried
away
to
die
and
pwyll
in
the
guise
of
arawn
received
the
submission
of
the
dead
subjects
and
annexed
his
realm
then
he
went
back
to
glyn
cûch
to
keep
his
tryst
with
arawn
they
retook
their
own
shapes
and
each
returned
to
his
own
kingdom
pwyll
learned
that
dyfed
had
never
been
ruled
so
well
or
been
so
prosperous
as
during
the
year
just
passed
as
for
the
king
of
hades
he
found
his
enemy
gone
and
his
domains
extended
and
when
he
caressed
his
wife
she
asked
him
why
he
did
so
now
after
the
lapse
of
a
whole
year
so
he
told
her
the
truth
and
they
both
agreed
that
they
had
indeed
got
a
true
friend
in
pwyll
after
this
the
kings
of
annwn
and
dyfed
made
their
friendship
strong
between
them
from
that
time
forward
says
the
story
pwyll
was
no
longer
called
prince
of
dyfed
but
head
of
the
second
mythological
incident
in
the
mabinogi
of
pwyll
prince
of
dyfed
tells
how
the
head
of
hades
won
his
wife
rhiannon
thought
by
professor
rhys
to
have
been
a
goddess
either
of
the
dawn
or
of
the
moon
there
was
a
mound
outside
palace
at
narberth
which
had
a
magical
quality
to
anyone
who
sat
upon
it
there
happened
one
of
two
things
either
he
received
wounds
and
blows
or
else
he
saw
a
wonder
one
day
it
occurred
to
pwyll
that
he
would
like
to
try
the
experience
of
the
mound
so
he
went
and
sat
upon
it
no
unseen
blows
assailed
pwyll
but
he
had
not
been
sitting
long
upon
the
mound
before
he
saw
coming
towards
him
lady
on
a
horse
of
large
size
with
a
garment
of
shining
gold
around
riding
very
quietly
he
sent
a
man
on
foot
to
ask
her
who
she
was
but
though
she
seemed
to
be
moving
so
slowly
the
man
could
not
come
up
to
her
he
failed
utterly
to
overtake
her
and
she
passed
on
out
of
sight
the
next
day
pwyll
went
again
to
the
mound
the
lady
appeared
and
this
time
pwyll
sent
a
horseman
at
first
the
horseman
only
ambled
along
at
about
the
same
pace
at
which
the
lady
seemed
to
be
going
then
failing
to
get
near
her
he
urged
his
horse
into
a
gallop
but
whether
he
rode
slow
or
fast
he
could
come
no
closer
to
the
lady
than
before
although
she
seemed
to
the
eyes
of
those
who
watched
to
have
been
going
only
at
a
pace
the
day
after
that
pwyll
determined
to
accost
the
lady
himself
she
came
at
the
same
gentle
walk
and
pwyll
at
first
rode
easily
and
then
at
his
topmost
speed
but
with
the
same
result
or
lack
of
it
at
last
in
despair
he
called
to
the
mysterious
damsel
to
stop
will
stop
gladly
said
she
it
would
have
been
better
for
your
horse
if
you
had
asked
me
she
told
him
that
her
name
was
rhiannon
daughter
of
heveydd
the
ancient
the
nobles
of
her
realm
had
determined
to
give
her
in
marriage
against
her
will
so
she
had
come
to
seek
out
pwyll
who
was
the
man
of
her
choice
pwyll
was
delighted
to
hear
this
for
he
thought
that
she
was
the
most
beautiful
lady
he
had
ever
seen
before
they
parted
they
had
plighted
troth
and
pwyll
had
promised
to
appear
on
that
day
twelvemonth
at
the
palace
of
her
father
heveydd
then
she
vanished
and
pwyll
returned
to
narberth
at
the
appointed
time
pwyll
went
to
visit
heveydd
the
ancient
with
a
hundred
followers
he
was
received
with
much
welcome
and
the
disposition
of
the
feast
put
under
his
command
as
the
celts
seem
to
have
done
to
especially
honoured
guests
as
they
sat
at
meat
with
pwyll
between
rhiannon
and
her
father
a
tall
youth
came
into
the
hall
greeted
pwyll
and
asked
a
boon
of
him
boon
you
may
ask
of
me
said
pwyll
thoughtlessly
it
is
in
my
power
you
shall
have
then
the
suitor
threw
off
all
disguise
called
the
guests
to
witness
promise
and
claimed
rhiannon
as
his
bride
pwyll
was
dumb
silent
as
long
as
you
will
said
the
masterful
rhiannon
did
a
man
make
worse
use
of
his
wits
than
you
have
replied
the
amazed
pwyll
knew
not
who
he
is
the
man
to
whom
they
would
have
given
me
against
my
will
she
answered
the
son
of
clûd
you
must
bestow
me
upon
him
now
lest
shame
befall
will
i
do
that
said
pwyll
me
upon
him
she
insisted
i
will
cause
that
i
shall
never
be
so
pwyll
promised
gwawl
that
he
would
make
a
feast
that
day
year
at
which
he
would
resign
rhiannon
to
him
the
next
year
the
feast
was
made
and
rhiannon
sat
by
the
side
of
her
unwelcome
bridegroom
but
pwyll
was
waiting
outside
the
palace
with
a
hundred
men
in
ambush
when
the
banquet
was
at
its
height
he
came
into
the
hall
dressed
in
coarse
ragged
garments
shod
with
clumsy
old
shoes
and
carrying
a
leather
bag
but
the
bag
was
a
magic
one
which
rhiannon
had
given
to
her
lover
with
directions
as
to
its
use
its
quality
was
that
however
much
was
put
into
it
it
could
never
be
filled
crave
a
boon
he
said
to
gwawl
is
it
gwawl
replied
am
a
poor
man
and
all
i
ask
is
to
have
this
bag
filled
with
gwawl
granted
what
he
said
was
request
within
and
ordered
his
followers
to
fill
the
bag
but
the
more
they
put
into
it
the
more
room
in
it
there
seemed
to
be
gwawl
was
astonished
and
asked
why
this
was
pwyll
replied
that
it
was
a
bag
that
could
never
be
filled
until
someone
possessed
of
lands
and
riches
should
tread
the
food
down
with
both
his
feet
this
for
the
man
said
rhiannon
to
gwawl
i
will
replied
he
and
put
both
his
feet
into
the
bag
but
no
sooner
had
he
done
so
than
pwyll
slipped
the
bag
over
head
and
tied
it
up
at
the
mouth
he
blew
his
horn
and
all
his
followers
came
in
have
you
got
in
the
bag
asked
each
one
in
turn
badger
replied
pwyll
then
each
as
he
received
answer
kicked
the
bag
or
hit
it
with
a
stick
says
the
story
the
game
of
in
the
first
gwawl
however
fared
better
than
we
suspect
that
the
badger
usually
did
for
heveydd
the
ancient
interceded
for
him
pwyll
willingly
released
him
on
condition
that
he
promised
to
give
up
all
claim
to
rhiannon
and
renounced
all
projects
of
revenge
gwawl
consented
and
gave
sureties
and
went
away
to
his
own
country
to
have
his
bruises
healed
this
country
of
was
no
doubt
the
sky
for
he
was
evidently
a
his
name
bewrays
him
for
the
meaning
of
is
it
was
one
of
the
hours
of
victory
for
the
dark
powers
such
as
were
celebrated
in
the
celtic
calendar
by
the
feast
of
samhain
or
summer
end
there
was
no
hindrance
now
to
the
marriage
of
pwyll
and
rhiannon
she
became
his
bride
and
returned
with
him
to
dyfed
for
three
years
they
were
without
an
heir
and
the
nobles
of
dyfed
became
discontented
they
petitioned
pwyll
to
take
another
wife
instead
of
rhiannon
he
asked
for
a
delay
this
was
granted
and
before
the
end
of
the
year
a
son
was
born
but
on
the
night
of
his
birth
the
six
women
set
to
keep
watch
over
rhiannon
all
fell
asleep
at
once
and
when
they
woke
up
the
boy
had
vanished
fearful
lest
their
lives
should
be
forfeited
for
their
neglect
they
agreed
to
swear
that
rhiannon
had
eaten
her
child
they
killed
a
litter
of
puppies
and
smeared
some
of
the
blood
on
face
and
hands
and
put
some
of
the
bones
by
her
side
then
they
awoke
her
with
a
great
outcry
and
accused
her
she
swore
that
she
knew
nothing
of
the
death
of
her
son
but
the
women
persisted
that
they
had
seen
her
devour
him
and
had
been
unable
to
prevent
it
the
druids
of
that
day
were
not
sufficiently
practical
anatomists
to
be
able
to
tell
the
bones
of
a
child
from
those
of
a
dog
so
they
condemned
rhiannon
upon
the
evidence
of
the
women
but
even
now
pwyll
would
not
put
her
away
so
she
was
assigned
a
penance
for
seven
years
she
was
to
sit
by
a
outside
the
gate
and
offer
to
carry
visitors
into
the
palace
upon
her
back
it
rarely
happened
says
the
mabinogi
any
would
permit
her
to
do
exactly
what
had
become
of
child
seems
to
have
been
a
mystery
even
to
the
writer
of
the
mabinogi
it
was
at
any
rate
in
some
way
connected
with
the
equally
mysterious
disappearance
on
every
night
of
the
first
of
the
celtic
the
colts
foaled
by
a
beautiful
mare
belonging
to
teirnyon
twryv
vliant
one
of
vassals
every
night
the
mare
foaled
but
no
one
knew
what
became
of
the
colt
teirnyon
decided
to
find
out
he
caused
the
mare
to
be
taken
into
a
house
and
there
he
watched
it
fully
armed
early
in
the
night
the
colt
was
born
then
there
was
a
great
noise
and
an
arm
with
claws
came
through
the
window
and
gripped
the
mane
teirnyon
hacked
at
the
arm
with
his
sword
and
cut
it
off
then
he
heard
wailing
and
opened
the
door
and
found
a
baby
in
swaddling
clothes
wrapped
in
a
satin
mantle
he
took
it
up
and
brought
it
to
his
wife
and
they
decided
to
adopt
it
they
called
the
boy
gwri
wallt
euryn
that
is
of
the
golden
the
older
the
boy
grew
the
more
it
seemed
to
teirnyon
that
he
became
like
pwyll
then
he
remembered
that
he
had
found
him
upon
the
very
night
that
rhiannon
lost
her
child
so
he
consulted
with
his
wife
and
they
both
agreed
that
the
baby
they
had
so
mysteriously
found
must
be
the
same
that
rhiannon
had
so
mysteriously
lost
and
they
decided
that
it
would
not
be
right
for
them
to
keep
the
son
of
another
while
so
good
a
lady
as
rhiannon
was
being
punished
wrongfully
so
the
very
next
day
teirnyon
set
out
for
narberth
taking
the
boy
with
him
they
found
rhiannon
sitting
as
usual
by
the
gate
but
they
would
not
allow
her
to
carry
them
into
the
palace
on
her
back
pwyll
welcomed
them
and
that
evening
as
they
sat
at
supper
teirnyon
told
his
hosts
the
story
from
beginning
to
end
and
he
presented
her
son
to
rhiannon
as
soon
as
everyone
in
the
palace
saw
the
boy
they
admitted
that
he
must
be
son
so
they
adopted
him
with
delight
and
pendaran
dyfed
the
head
druid
of

gave
him

called

the

as
well
as
two
sons
of
mother
penardun
by
an
earlier
marriage
were
holding
court
at
now
called
harlech
as
they
sat
on
a
cliff
looking
over
the
sea
they
saw
thirteen
ships
coming
from
ireland
the
fleet
sailed
close
under
the
land
and
brân
sent
messengers
to
ask
who
they
were
and
why
they
had
come
it
was
replied
that
they
were
the
vessels
of
matholwch
king
of
ireland
and
that
he
had
come
to
ask
brân
for
his
sister
branwen
in
marriage
brân
consented
and
they
fixed
upon
aberffraw
in
anglesey
as
the
place
at
which
to
hold
the
wedding
feast
matholwch
and
his
fleet
went
there
by
sea
and
brân
and
his
host
by
land
when
they
arrived
and
met
they
set
up
pavilions
for
house
could
ever
hold
the
blessed
and
there
branwen
became
the
king
of
bride
these
relations
were
not
long
however
allowed
to
be
friendly
of
the
two
other
sons
of
wife
penardun
the
mother
of
manawyddan
one
was
called
nissyen
and
the
other
evnissyen
nissyen
was
a
lover
of
peace
and
would
always
his
family
to
be
friends
when
their
wrath
was
at
the
but
evnissyen
cause
strife
between
his
two
brothers
when
they
were
most
at
now
evnissyen
was
enraged
because
his
consent
had
not
been
asked
to
marriage
out
of
spite
at
this
he
cut
off
the
lips
ears
eyebrows
and
tails
of
all
horses
when
the
king
of
ireland
found
this
out
he
was
very
indignant
at
the
insult
but
brân
sent
an
embassy
to
him
twice
explaining
that
it
had
not
been
done
by
his
consent
or
with
his
knowledge
he
appeased
matholwch
by
giving
him
a
sound
horse
in
place
of
every
one
that
evnissyen
had
mutilated
as
well
as
a
staff
of
silver
as
large
and
tall
as
matholwch
himself
and
a
plate
of
gold
as
broad
as
face
to
these
gifts
he
also
added
a
magic
cauldron
brought
from
ireland
its
property
was
that
any
slain
man
who
was
put
into
it
was
brought
to
life
again
except
that
he
lost
the
use
of
speech
the
king
of
ireland
accepted
this
recompense
for
the
insult
done
him
renewed
his
friendship
with
the
children
of
llyr
and
sailed
away
with
branwen
to
ireland
before
a
year
was
over
branwen
bore
a
son
they
called
him
gwern
and
put
him
out
to
be
among
the
best
men
of
ireland
but
during
the
second
year
news
came
to
ireland
of
the
insult
that
matholwch
had
received
in
britain
the
king
of
and
near
relations
insisted
that
he
should
revenge
himself
upon
branwen
so
the
queen
was
compelled
to
serve
in
the
kitchen
and
every
day
the
butcher
gave
her
a
box
upon
the
ear
that
this
should
not
become
known
to
brân
all
traffic
was
forbidden
between
ireland
and
britain
this
went
on
for
three
years
but
in
the
meantime
branwen
had
reared
a
tame
starling
and
she
taught
it
to
speak
and
tied
a
letter
of
complaint
to
the
root
of
its
wing
and
sent
it
off
to
britain
at
last
it
found
brân
whom
its
mistress
had
described
to
it
and
settled
upon
his
shoulder
ruffling
its
wings
this
exposed
the
letter
and
brân
read
it
he
sent
messengers
to
one
hundred
and
countries
to
raise
an
army
to
go
to
ireland
leaving
his
son
caradawc
with
seven
others
in
charge
of
britain
he
wading
through
the
sea
while
his
men
went
by
ship
no
one
in
ireland
knew
that
they
were
coming
until
the
royal
swineherds
tending
their
pigs
near
the
beheld
a
marvel
they
saw
a
forest
on
the
surface
of
the
place
where
certainly
no
forest
had
been
near
it
a
mountain
with
a
lofty
ridge
on
its
top
and
a
lake
on
each
side
of
the
ridge
both
the
forest
and
the
mountain
were
swiftly
moving
towards
ireland
they
informed
matholwch
who
could
not
understand
it
and
sent
messengers
to
ask
branwen
what
she
thought
it
might
be
is
the
men
of
the
island
of
the
mighty
said
she
are
coming
here
because
they
have
heard
of
my
the
forest
that
is
seen
on
the
sea
is
made
of
the
masts
of
ships
the
mountain
is
my
brother
brân
wading
into
shoal
water
the
lofty
ridge
is
his
nose
and
the
two
lakes
one
on
each
side
of
it
are
his
the
men
of
ireland
were
terrified
they
fled
beyond
the
shannon
and
broke
down
the
bridge
over
it
but
brân
lay
down
across
the
river
and
his
army
walked
over
him
to
the
opposite
side
matholwch
now
sent
messengers
suing
for
peace
he
offered
to
resign
the
throne
of
ireland
to
gwern
son
and
nephew
i
not
have
the
kingdom
myself
said
brân
and
would
not
hear
of
anything
else
so
the
counsellors
of
matholwch
advised
him
to
conciliate
brân
by
building
him
a
house
so
large
that
it
would
be
the
first
house
that
had
ever
held
him
and
in
it
to
hand
over
the
kingdom
to
his
will
brân
consented
to
accept
this
and
the
vast
house
was
built
it
concealed
treachery
upon
each
side
of
the
hundred
pillars
of
the
house
was
hung
a
bag
and
in
the
bag
was
an
armed
man
who
was
to
cut
himself
out
at
a
given
signal
but
evnissyen
came
into
the
house
and
seeing
the
bags
there
suspected
the
plot
is
in
this
bag
he
said
to
one
of
the
irish
as
he
came
up
to
the
first
one
replied
the
irishman
then
evnissyen
kneaded
the
bag
in
his
hands
as
though
it
really
contained
meal
until
he
had
killed
the
man
inside
and
he
treated
all
of
them
in
turn
in
the
same
way
a
little
later
the
two
hosts
met
in
the
house
the
men
of
ireland
came
in
on
one
side
and
the
men
of
britain
on
the
other
and
met
at
the
hearth
in
the
middle
and
sat
down
the
irish
court
did
homage
to
brân
and
they
crowned
gwern
son
king
of
ireland
in
place
of
matholwch
when
the
ceremonies
were
over
the
boy
went
from
one
to
another
of
his
uncles
to
make
acquaintance
with
them
brân
fondled
and
caressed
him
and
so
did
manawyddan
and
nissyen
but
when
he
came
to
evnissyen
the
wicked
son
of
penardun
seized
the
child
by
the
feet
and
dropped
him
head
first
into
the
great
fire
when
branwen
saw
her
son
killed
she
tried
to
leap
into
the
flames
after
him
but
brân
held
her
back
then
every
man
armed
himself
and
such
a
tumult
was
never
heard
in
one
house
before
day
after
day
they
fought
but
the
irish
had
the
advantage
for
they
had
only
to
plunge
their
dead
men
into
the
magic
cauldron
to
bring
them
back
to
life
when
evnissyen
knew
this
he
saw
a
way
of
atoning
for
the
misfortunes
his
evil
nature
had
brought
upon
britain
he
disguised
himself
as
an
irishman
and
lay
upon
the
floor
as
if
dead
until
they
put
him
into
the
cauldron
then
he
stretched
himself
and
with
one
desperate
effort
burst
both
the
cauldron
and
his
own
heart
thus
things
were
made
equal
again
and
in
the
next
battle
the
men
of
britain
killed
all
the
irish
but
of
themselves
there
were
only
seven
left
manawyddan
gluneu
the
son
of
taran
taliesin
the
bard
ynawc
grudyen
the
son
of
muryel
and
heilyn
the
son
of
gwynn
the
ancient
brân
himself
was
wounded
in
the
foot
with
a
poisoned
dart
and
was
in
agony
so
he
ordered
his
seven
surviving
followers
to
cut
off
his
head
and
to
take
it
to
the
white
mount
in
london
and
bury
it
there
with
the
face
towards
france
he
prophesied
how
they
would
perform
the
journey
at
harlech
they
would
be
feasting
seven
years
the
birds
of
rhiannon
singing
to
them
all
the
time
and
own
head
conversing
with
them
as
agreeably
as
when
it
was
on
his
body
then
they
would
be
fourscore
years
at
gwales
all
this
while
head
would
remain
uncorrupted
and
would
talk
so
pleasantly
that
they
would
forget
the
flight
of
time
but
at
the
destined
hour
someone
would
open
a
door
which
looked
towards
cornwall
and
after
that
they
could
stay
no
longer
but
must
hurry
to
london
to
bury
the
head
so
the
seven
beheaded
brân
and
set
off
taking
branwen
also
with
them
they
landed
at
the
mouth
of
the
river
alaw
in
anglesey
branwen
first
looked
back
towards
ireland
and
then
forward
towards
britain
she
cried
i
was
ever
born
two
islands
have
been
destroyed
because
of
her
heart
broke
with
sorrow
and
she
died
an
old
welsh
poem
says
with
a
touch
of
real
pathos
were
the
voices
in
the
brakes
of
the
wondering
birds
on
seeing
the
fair
body
will
there
not
be
relating
again
of
that
which
befel
the
paragon
at
the
stream
of
amlwch
made
her
a
grave
says
the
mabinogi
buried
her
upon
the
banks
of
the
the
traditionary
spot
has
always
borne
the
name
of
and
curiously
enough
an
urn
was
found
there
in
full
of
ashes
and
bones
which
certain
enthusiastic
local
antiquaries
saw
reason
to
were
those
of
the
fair
british
aphrodité
herself
the
seven
went
on
towards
harlech
and
as
they
journeyed
they
met
men
and
women
who
gave
them
the
latest
news
caswallawn
a
son
of
beli
the
husband
of
dôn
had
destroyed
the
ministers
left
behind
by
brân
to
take
care
of
britain
he
had
made
himself
invisible
by
the
help
of
a
magic
veil
and
thus
had
killed
all
of
them
except
pendaran
dyfed
of
pryderi
who
had
escaped
into
the
woods
and
caradawc
son
of
brân
whose
heart
had
broken
from
grief
thus
he
had
made
himself
king
of
the
whole
island
in
place
of
manawyddan
its
rightful
heir
now
that
brân
was
dead
however
the
destiny
was
upon
the
seven
that
they
should
go
on
with
their
head
they
went
to
harlech
and
feasted
for
seven
years
the
three
birds
of
rhiannon
singing
them
songs
compared
with
which
all
other
songs
seemed
unmelodious
then
they
spent
fourscore
years
in
the
isle
of
gwales
eating
and
drinking
and
listening
to
the
pleasant
conversation
of
head
the
of
the
noble

almost
more
notable

mythology

brân

was
decapitated
taliesin

invoke
it
repeatedly
as
the

all

end

opened

if

which

said

soon

looked

the

had

them

for
years
failed
and
left

grieved
about
the
death
of
their
lord
as
though
it
had
happened
that
very
day
they
could
not
rest

in
hereford
where
they
had
settled
would
buy
from
any
saddler
but
himself
this
aroused
the
enmity
of
all
the
other
saddlers
and
they
conspired
to
kill
the
strangers
so
the
four
went
to
another
city
here
they
made
shields
and
soon
no
one
would
purchase
a
shield
unless
it
had
been
made
by
manawyddan
and
pryderi
the
became
jealous
and
again
a
move
had
to
be
made
but
they
fared
no
better
at
the
next
town
where
they
practised
the
craft
of
cordwainers
manawyddan
shaping
the
shoes
and
pryderi
stitching
them
so
they
went
back
to
dyfed
again
and
occupied
themselves
in
hunting
one
day
the
hounds
of
manawyddan
and
pryderi
roused
a
white
wild
boar
they
chased
it
till
they
came
to
a
castle
at
a
place
where
both
the
huntsmen
were
certain
that
no
castle
had
been
before
into
this
castle
went
the
boar
and
the
hounds
after
it
for
some
time
manawyddan
and
pryderi
waited
in
vain
for
their
return
pryderi
then
proposed
that
he
should
go
into
the
castle
and
see
what
had
become
of
them
manawyddan
tried
to
dissuade
him
declaring
that
whoever
their
enemy
was
who
had
laid
dyfed
waste
had
also
caused
the
appearance
of
this
castle
but
pryderi
insisted
upon
entering
in
the
castle
he
found
neither
the
boar
nor
his
hounds
nor
any
trace
of
man
or
beast
there
was
nothing
but
a
fountain
in
the
centre
of
the
castle
floor
and
on
the
brink
of
the
fountain
a
beautiful
golden
bowl
fastened
to
a
marble
slab
by
chains
pryderi
was
so
pleased
with
the
beauty
of
the
bowl
that
he
put
out
his
hands
and
took
hold
of
it
whereupon
his
hands
stuck
to
the
bowl
so
that
he
could
not
move
from
where
he
stood
manawyddan
waited
for
him
till
the
evening
and
then
returned
to
the
palace
and
told
rhiannon
she
more
daring
than
her
husband
rebuked
him
for
cowardice
and
went
straight
to
the
magic
castle
in
the
court
she
found
pryderi
his
hands
still
glued
to
the
bowl
and
his
feet
to
the
slab
she
tried
to
free
him
but
became
fixed
herself
and
with
a
clap
of
thunder
and
a
fall
of
mist
the
castle
vanished
with
its
two
prisoners
manawyddan
was
now
left
alone
with
kicva
wife
he
calmed
her
fears
and
assured
her
of
his
protection
but
they
had
lost
their
dogs
and
could
not
hunt
any
more
so
they
set
out
together
to
lloegyr
to
practise
again
old
trade
of
cordwainer
a
second
time
the
envious
cordwainers
conspired
to
kill
them
so
they
were
obliged
to
return
to
dyfed
but
manawyddan
took
back
a
burden
of
wheat
with
him
to
narberth
and
sowed
three
crofts
all
of
which
sprang
up
abundantly
when
harvest
time
came
he
went
to
look
at
his
first
croft
and
found
it
ripe
will
reap
this
he
said
but
in
the
morning
he
found
nothing
but
the
bare
straw
every
ear
had
been
taken
away
so
he
went
to
the
next
croft
which
was
also
ripe
but
when
he
came
to
cut
it
he
found
it
had
been
stripped
like
the
first
then
he
knew
that
whoever
had
wasted
dyfed
and
carried
off
rhiannon
and
pryderi
was
also
at
work
upon
his
wheat
the
third
croft
was
also
ripe
and
over
this
one
he
determined
to
keep
watch
in
the
evening
he
armed
himself
and
waited
at
midnight
he
heard
a
great
tumult
and
looking
out
saw
a
host
of
mice
coming
each
mouse
bit
off
an
ear
of
wheat
and
ran
off
with
it
he
rushed
among
them
but
could
only
catch
one
which
was
more
sluggish
than
the
rest
this
one
he
put
into
his
glove
and
took
it
back
and
showed
it
to
kicva
i
will
hang
it
he
said
is
not
a
fit
thing
for
a
man
of
your
dignity
to
hang
a
mouse
she
replied
will
i
do
so
said
he
so
then
said
kicva
the
next
morning
manawyddan
went
to
the
magic
mound
and
set
up
two
forks
on
it
to
make
a
gallows
he
had
just
finished
when
a
man
dressed
like
a
poor
scholar
came
towards
him
and
greeted
him
are
you
doing
lord
he
said
am
going
to
hang
a
thief
replied
manawyddan
sort
of
a
thief
i
see
an
animal
like
a
mouse
in
your
hand
but
a
man
of
rank
like
yours

not
touch

a
creature

it
go

robbing

replied
manawyddan
it
shall
die
a
do
not
care
to

such
a
thing
said
the
scholar
will

not
let
it
go
replied
manawyddan
will

nothing
to
me
returned
the
scholar
and
he
went
away
manawyddan
laid
a
along
the
forks
as
he
did
so
another
man
came
by
a
priest
riding
on
a
horse
he
asked
manawyddan
what
he
was
doing
and
was
told
lord
he
said
a
reptile
is
worth
nothing
to
buy
but
rather
than
see
you
degrade
yourself
by
touching
it
i
will
give
you
three
pounds
to
let
it
will
take
no
money
for
it
replied
manawyddan

hanged
said
the
priest
and
went
his
way
manawyddan
put
the
noose
round
the
neck
and
was
just
going
to
draw
it
up
when
he
saw
a
bishop
coming
with
his
whole
retinue
blessing

he
said

the
bishop

the
bishop

manawyddan
i
know
who
the
mouse
is
my
wife
replied
the
bishop
i
am
called
llwyd
the
son
of
kilcoed
and
i
cast
the
charm
over
dyfed
and
upon
rhiannon
and
pryderi
to
avenge
gwawl
son
of
clûd
for
the
game
of
in
the
which
was
played
on
him
by
pwyll
head
of
annwn
it
was
my
household
that
came
in
the
guise
of
mice
and
took

and
they
greeted

manawyddan
so
he
released
the
mouse
and
llwyd
struck
her
with
a
wand
and
turned
her
into
young
woman
the
fairest
ever
and
when
manawyddan
looked
round
him
he
saw
dyfed
tilled
and
cultivated
again
as
it
had
formerly
been

the
victories
of
light
over
darkness
the
powers
of
light
were
however
by
no
means
invariably
successful
in
their
struggles
with
the
powers
of
darkness
even
gwydion
son
of
dôn
had
to
serve
his
apprenticeship
to
misfortune
assailing
caer
under
one
of
its
many
titles
was
caught
by
pwyll
and
pryderi
and
endured
a
long
imprisonment
the
sufferings
he
underwent
made
him
a
ancient
celtic
idea
which
one
can
still
see
surviving
in
the
popular
tradition
that
whoever
dares
to
spend
a
night
alone
either
upon
the
chair
of
the
giant
idris
the
summit
of
cader
idris
in
merionethshire
or
under
the
haunted
black
stone
of
arddu
upon
the
llanberis
side
of
snowdon
will
be
found
in
the
morning
either
inspired
or
mad
how
he
escaped
we
are
not
told
but
the
episode
does
not
seem
to
have
quenched
his
ardour
against
the
natural
enemies
of
his
kind
helped
by
his
brother
amaethon
god
of
agriculture
and
his
son
lleu
he
fought
the
battle
of
godeu
or
an
exploit
which
is
not
the
least
curious
of
celtic
myths
it
is
known
also
as
the
battle
of
achren
or
ochren
a
name
for
hades
of
unknown
meaning
but
appearing
again
in
the
remarkable
welsh
poem
which
describes
the
of
by
arthur
the
king
of
achren
was
arawn
and
he
was
helped
by
brân
who
apparently
had
not
then
made
his
fatal
journey
to
ireland
the
war
was
made
to
secure
three
boons
for
dog
the
deer
and
the
lapwing
all
of
them
creatures
for
some
reason
sacred
to
the
gods
of
the
nether
world
gwydion
was
this
time
not
alone
as
he
apparently
was
when
he
made
his
first
unfortunate
reconnaissance
of
hades
besides
his
brother
and
his
son
he
had
an
army
which
he
raised
for
the
purpose
for
a
leader
of
magical
attainments
there
was
no
need
of
standing
troops
he
could
call
battalions
into
being
with
a
charm
and
dismiss
them
when
they
were
no
longer
needed
the
name
of
the
battle
shows
what
he
did
on
this
occasion
and
the
bard
taliesin
adds
his
testimony
have
been
in
the
battle
of
godeu
with
lleu
and
gwydion
they
changed
the

the
elementary

to
it

tells

the
fight
the
alders

but
the
willows
and
the
quickens
came
late
and
the
birch
though
courageous
took
long
in
arraying
himself
the

the

from

whence

came
it
was
always
to
obtain
some
practical

of

they
were

and
arawn

them
as
a
gift
to

son
of

they
were
small
animals
and
their
flesh
was
said
to
be
better
than
the
flesh
of
oxen
he
thought
it
would
be
a
good
thing
to
get
them
either
by

fraud

off
with

they
disguised
themselves
as
bards
so
as
to
be
received
by

tales
in

entertained
the
prince
of
dyfed
and
his
court
more
than
they
had
ever
been
entertained
by
any
before
then
he
asked
pryderi
to
grant
him
a
animals
which
had
come
from
annwn
but
pryderi
had
pledged
his
word
to
arawn
that
he
would
neither
sell
nor
give
away
any
of
the
new
creatures
until
they
had
increased
to
double
their
number
and
he
told
the
disguised
gwydion
so
said
gwydion
can
set
you
free
from
your
promise
neither
give
me
the
swine
at
once
nor
yet
refuse
them
to
me
altogether
and
i
will
show
you
he
went
to
the
lodging
pryderi
had
assigned
him
and
began
to
work
his
charms
and
illusions
out
of
fungus
he
made
twelve
gilded
shields
and
twelve
horses
with
gold
harness
and
twelve
black
greyhounds
with
white
breasts
each
wearing
a
golden
collar
and
leash
and
these
he
showed
to
pryderi
said
he
is
a
release
from
the
word
you
spoke
last
evening
concerning
the
you
may
neither
give
them
nor
sell
them
you
may
exchange
them
for
something
which
is
better

will
give
you
these
twelve
horses
with
their
gold
harness
and
these
twelve
greyhounds
with
their
gold
collars
and
leashes
and
these
twelve
gilded
shields
for
pryderi
took
counsel
with
his
men
and
agreed
to
the
bargain
so
gwydion
and
his
followers
took
the
swine
and
went
away
with
them
hurrying
as
fast
as
they
could
for
gwydion
knew
that
the
illusion
would
not
last
longer
than
a
day
the
memory
of
their
journey
was
long
kept
up

the
mythological
of
the
of
his
sudden
rise
into
prominence
is
one
of
the
many
problems
of
the
celtic
mythology
he
is
not
mentioned
in
any
of
the
four
branches
of
the
mabinogi
which
deal
with
the
races
of
british
gods
equivalent
to
the
gaelic
tuatha

the
earliest
references
to
him
in

seem
to
treat
him
as
merely
a
no
better
if
no
worse
than
several
others
such
as
a
tributary
prince
of
immortalized
both
by
the
bards
and
by
tennyson
then
following
upon
this
we
find
him
lifted
to
the
extraordinary
position
of
a
king
of
gods
to
whom
the
old
divine
families
of
dôn
of
llyr
and
of

pay
unquestioned
homage

is

rally
round
him
at
his
call
the
most
probable
and
only
adequate
explanation
is
given
by
professor
rhys
who
considers
that
the
fames
of
two
separate
arthurs
have
been
accidentally
confused
to
the
exceeding
renown
of
a
composite
personage
into
whom
the
two
blended
one
of
these
was
a
divine
arthur
a
god
more
or
less
widely
worshipped
in
the
celtic
same
no
doubt
whom
an
inscription
found
in
france
calls
the
other
was
a
human
arthur
who
held
among
the
britons
the
post
which
under
roman
domination
had
been
called
this
of
was
the
supreme
military
authority
he
had
a
roving
commission
to
defend
the
country
against
foreign
invasion
and
under
his
orders
were
two
slightly
subordinate
officers
the
duke
of
the
britains
who
had
charge
of
the
northern
wall
and
the
littoris
count
of
the
saxon
shore
who
guarded
the
coasts
the
britons
after
the
departure
of
the
romans
long
kept
intact
the
organization
their
conquerors
had
built
up
and
it
seems
reasonable
to
believe
that
this
post
of
leader
in
war
was
the
same
which
early
welsh
literature
describes
as
that
of
a
title
given
to
arthur
alone
among
the
british
heroes
the
fame
of
arthur
the
emperor
blended
with
that
of
arthur
the
god
so
that
it
became
conterminous
with
the
area
over
which
we
have
traced
brythonic
settlement
in
great
britain
hence
the
many
disputes
ably
if
unprofitably
conducted
over
and
the
sites
of
such
cities
as
camelot
and
of
twelve
great
battles
historical
elements
doubtless
coloured
the
tales
of
arthur
and
his
companions
but
they
are
none
the
less
as
essentially
mythic
as
those
told
of
their
gaelic
red
branch
heroes
of
ulster
and
the
fenians
of
those
two
cycles
it
is
with
the
latter
that
the
arthurian
legend
shows
most
affinity
position
as
supreme
of
britain
curiously
parallels
that
of
as
general
of
a
irish
his
of
warriors
also
reminds
one
of
fenians
sworn
to
adventure
both
alike
battle
with
human
and
superhuman
foes
both
alike
harry
europe
even
to
the
walls
of
rome
the
of
arthur
his
wife
gwynhwyvar
guinevere
and
his
nephew
medrawt
mordred
resembles
in
several
ways
that
of
finn
his
wife
grainne
and
his
nephew
diarmait
in
the
stories
of
the
last
battles
of
arthur
and
of
the
fenians
the
essence
of
the
kindred
myth
still
subsists
though
the
actual
exponents
of
it
slightly
differ
at
the
fight
of
camlan
it
was
arthur
and
medrawt
themselves
who
fought
the
final
duel
but
in
the
last
stand
of
the
fenians
at
gabhra
the
original
protagonists
have
given
place
to
their
descendants
and
representatives
both
finn
and
cormac
were
already
dead
it
is
oscar
grandson
and
cairbré
son
who
fight
and
slay
each
other
and
again
just
as
arthur
was
thought
by
many
not
to
have
really
died
but
to
have
passed
to
island
valley
of
so
a
scottish
legend
tells
us
how
ages
after
the
fenians
a
man
landing
by
chance
upon
a
mysterious
western
island
met
and
spoke
with
finn
mac
coul
even
the
alternative
legend
which
makes
arthur
and
his
warriors
wait
under
the
earth
in
a
magic
sleep
for
the
return
of
their
triumph
is
also
told
of
the
fenians
but
these
parallels
though
they
illustrate
do
not
show
his
real
place
among
the
gods
to
determine
this
we
must
examine
the
ranks
of
the
older
dynasties
carefully
to
see
if
any
are
missing
whose
attributes
this
may
have
inherited
we
find
lludd
and
gwyn
arawn
pryderi
and
manawyddan
side
by
side
with
him
under
their
own
names
among
the
children
of
dôn
are
amaethon
and
govannan
but
here
the
list
stops
with
a
notable
omission
there
is
no
mention
in
later
myth
of
gwydion
that
greatest
of
the
sons
of
dôn
has
fallen
out
and
vanished
without
a
sign
singularly
enough
too
the
same
stories
that
were
once
told
of
gwydion
are
now
attached
to
the
name
of
arthur
so
that
we
may
assume
with
professor
rhys
that
arthur
the
prominent
god
of
a
new
pantheon
has
taken
the
place
of
gwydion
in
the
old
a
comparison
of
and
shows
an
almost
exact
correspondence
in
everything
but
name
like
gwydion
arthur
is
the
exponent
of
culture
and
of
arts
therefore
we
see
him
carrying
on
the
same
war
against
the
underworld
for
wealth
and
wisdom
that
gwydion
and
the
sons
of
dôn
waged
against
the
sons
of
llyr
the
sea
and
of
pwyll
the
head
of
hades
like
gwydion
too
arthur
suffered
early
reverses
he
failed
indeed
even
where
his
prototype
had
succeeded
gwydion
we
know
from
the
mabinogi
of
mâth
successfully
stole
pigs
but
arthur
was
utterly
baffled
in
his
attempt
to
capture
the
swine
of
a
similar
prince
of
the
underworld
called
march
son
of
meirchion
also
as
with
gwydion
his
earliest
reconnaissance
of
hades
was
disastrous
and
led
to
his
capture
and
imprisonment
manawyddan
son
of
llyr
confined
him
in
the
mysterious
and
gruesome
of
oeth
and
anoeth
and
there
he
languished
for
three
days
and
three
nights
before
a
rescuer
came
in
the
person
of
goreu
his
cousin
but
in
the
end
he
triumphed
a
welsh
poem
ascribed
to
the
bard
taliesin
relates
under
the
title
spoiling
of
an
expedition
of
arthur
and
his
followers
into
the
very
heart
of
that
country
from
which
he
appears
to
have
returned
for
the
verses
are
somewhat
obscure
with
the
loss
of
almost
all
his
men
but
in
possession
of
the
object
of
his
magic
cauldron
of
inspiration
and
poetry
taliesin
tells
the
story
as
an
he
may
well
have
done
so
for
it
was
his
boast
that
from
the
creation
of
the
world
he
had
allowed
himself
to
miss
no
event
of
importance
he
was
in
heaven
he
tells
us
when
lucifer
fell
and
in
the
court
of
dôn
before
gwydion
was
born
he
had
been
among
the
constellations
both
with
mary
magdalene
and
with
the
pagan
goddess
arianrod
he
carried
a
banner
before
alexander
and
was
chief
director
of
the
building
of
the
tower
of
babel
he
saw
the
fall
of
troy
and
the
founding
of
rome
he
was
with
noah
in
the
ark
and
he
witnessed
the
destruction
of
sodom
and
gomorrah
and
he
was
present
both
at
the
manger
of
bethlehem
and
at
the
cross
of
calvary
but
unfortunately
taliesin
as
a
credible
personage
rests
under
exactly
the
same
disabilities
as
arthur
himself
it
is
not
denied
by
scholars
that
there
was
a
real
taliesin
a
bard
to
whom
were
attributed
and
who
may
have
actually
composed
some
of
the
poems
in
the
book
of
taliesin
but
there
was
also
another
taliesin
whom
as
a
mythical
poet
of
the
british
celts
professor
rhys
is
inclined
to
equate
with
the
gaelic
ossian
the
traditions
of
the
two
mingled
endowing
the
historic
taliesin
with
the
attributes
of
his
predecessor
and
clothing
the
mythical
taliesin
with
some
of
the
actuality
of
his
successor
it
is
regrettable
that
our
bard
did
not
at
times
sing
a
little
less
incoherently
for
his
poem
contains
the
fullest
description
that
has
come
down
to
us
of
the
other
world
as
the
britons
conceived
it
apparently
the
numerous
names
all
different
and
some
now
untranslatable
refer
to
the
same
place
and
they
must
be
collated
to
form
a
right
idea
of
what
annwn
was
like
with
the
exception
of
an
obviously
spurious
last
verse
here
omitted
the
poem
is
magnificently
pagan
and
quite

of

animal

but
the
earlier
portion
of
the
poem
is
fortunately
clearer
and
it
gives
glimpses
of
a
grandeur
of
savage
imagination
the
foursquare
fortress
of
glass
manned
by
its
dumb
ghostly
sentinels
spun
round
in
revolution
so
that
few
could
find
its
entrance
it
was
save
for
the
twilight
made
by
the
lamp
burning
before
its
circling
gate
feasting

and

and
in

choicest
of
its

was
the
cauldron
of

kept
bubbling
by

of

british
pythonesses
so
that
it
might
give
forth
its
oracles
to
this
scanty
information
we
may
add
a
few
lines
also
by
taliesin
and
contained
in
a
poem
called

concerning
the
sons
of

the

however
added
by
it
to
our
knowledge
it
reminds
us
that
annwn
was
surrounded
by
the
heavy
blue
which
held
gweir
so
firmly
informs
us
that
the
which

kept

it
adds
to
the
revelry
the
singing
of
the

it
makes
a
point
that
its
inhabitants
were
freed
from
age
and
death
and
last
of
all
it
shows
us
as
we
might
have
expected
the
ubiquitous
taliesin
as
a
privileged
resident
of
this
delightful
region

have

clues
as
to
where
the
country
may
have
been
situated
lundy
island
off
the
coast
of
devonshire
was
anciently
called
the
of
or
gwydion
the
welsh
translation
of
the
an
romance
embodying
much
of
the
old
mythology
locates
its
the
same
as
caer
the
district
around
and
comprising
puffin
island
off
the
coast
of
anglesey
but
these
are
slender
threads
by
which
to
tether
to
firm
ground
a
realm
of
the
imagination
with
gwydion
too
have
disappeared
the
whole
of
the
characters
connected
with
him
in
that
portion
of
the
mabinogi
of
mâth
son
of
mathonwy
which
recounts
the
myth
of
the
birth
of
the
neither
mâth
himself
nor
lleu
llaw
gyffes
nor
dylan
nor
their
mother
arianrod
play
any
more
part
they
have
vanished
as
completely
as
gwydion
but
the
essence
of
the
myth
of
which
they
were
the
figures
remains
intact
gwydion
was
the
father
by
his
sister
arianrod
wife
of
a
waning
called
nwyvre
space
of
twin
sons
lleu
a
god
of
light
and
dylan
a
god
of
darkness
and
we
find
this
same
story
woven
into
the
very
innermost
texture
of
the
legend
of
arthur
the
new
arianrod
though
called
by
sir
thomas
malory
and
by
geoffrey
of
monmouth
is
known
to
earlier
welsh
myth
as
she
was
the
sister
of
arthur
and
the
wife
of
the
lludd
and
her
name
which
means
or
reminds
us
of
the
relationship
of
the
morrígú
the
of
the
gaels
to
the
nuada
the
new
lleu
llaw
gyffes
is
called
gwalchmei
that
is
the
of
and
the
new
dylan
is
medrawt
at
once
son
and
brother
and
the
bitterest
enemy
of
both
besides
these
friends
with
new
arthur
brings
with
him
into
prominence
a
fresh
pantheon
most
of
whom
also
replace
the
older
gods
of
the
heavens
and
earth
and
the
regions
under
the
earth
the
zeus
of
cycle
is
called
myrddin
who
passed
into
the
romances
as
all
the
myths
told
of
him
bear
witness
to
his
high
estate
the
first
name
of
britain
before
it
was
inhabited
was
we
learn
from
a
triad
that
is
he
is
given
a
wife
whose
attributes
recall
those
of
the
consorts
of
nuada
and
lludd
she
is
described
as
the
only
daughter
of
british
name
of
the
gaulish
a
god
of
war
and
the
was
called
elen
lwyddawg
that
is
leader
of
her
memory
is
still
preserved
in
wales
in
connection
with
ancient
roadways
such
names
as
and
seem
to
show
that
the
paths
on
which
armies
marched
were
ascribed
or
dedicated
to
her
as
wife
she
is
credited
with
having
founded
the
town
of
carmarthen
as
well
as
the
fortress
in
which
must
have
been
the
site
near
beddgelert
still
called
the
of
one
of
epithets
or
names
professor
rhys
is
inclined
to
credit
myrddin
or
rather
the
british
zeus
under
whatever
name
with
having
been
the
god
especially
worshipped
at
stonehenge
certainly
this
impressive
temple
ever
unroofed
and
open
to
the
sun
and
wind
and
rain
of
heaven
would
seem
peculiarly
appropriate
to
a
british
supreme
god
of
light
and
sky
neither
are
we
quite
without
documentary
evidence
which
will
allow
us
to
connect
it
with
him
geoffrey
of
monmouth
whose
historical
fictions
usually
conceal
mythological
facts
relates
that
the
stones
which
compose
it
were
erected
by
merlin
before
that
they
had
stood
in
ireland
upon
a
hill
which
geoffrey
calls
and
which
can
be
identified
as
the
same
spot
known
to
irish
legend
as
the
of
and
still
earlier
connected
with
balor
according
to
british
tradition
the
primeval
giants
who
first
colonized
ireland
had
brought
them
from
their
original
home
on
farthest
coast
of
on
account
of
their
miraculous
virtues
for
any
water
in
which
they
were
bathed
became
a
sovereign
remedy
either
for
sickness
or
for
wounds
by
the
order
of
aurelius
a
king
of
britain
merlin
brought
them
thence
to
england
to
be
set
up
on
salisbury
plain
as
a
monument
to
the
british
chieftains
treacherously
slain
by
hengist
and
his
saxons
with
this
scrap
of
native
information
about
stonehenge
we
may
compare
the
only
other
piece
we
account
of
the
classic
diodorus
who
called
it
a
temple
of
apollo
at
first
these
two
statements
seem
to
conflict
but
it
is
far
from
unlikely
that
the
earlier
celtic
settlers
in
britain
made
little
or
no
religious
distinction
between
sky
and
sun
the
as
a
separate
personage
seems
to
have
been
the
conception
of
a
comparatively
late
age
celtic
mythology
allows
us
to
be
present
as
it
were
at
the
births
both
of
the
gaelic
lugh
lamhfada
and
the
british
lleu
llaw
gyffes
even
the
story
of
or
final
imprisonment
in
a
tomb
of
airy
tour
withouten
walles
or
withoute
eny
marvellously
like
a
myth
of
the
sun
all
his
fires
and
travelling
glories
round
encircled
shielded
and
made
splendid
by
his
atmosphere
of
living
light
the
lord
of
heaven
moves
slowly
towards
the
west
to
disappear
at
last
into
the
sea
as
one
local
version
of
the
myth
puts
it
or
on
to
a
island
as
another
says
or
into
a
dark
forest
the
choice
of
a
third
when
the
myth
became
finally
fixed
it
was
bardsey
island
off
the
extreme
westernmost
point
of
caernarvonshire
that
was
selected
as
his
last
abode
into
it
he
went
with
nine
attendant
bards
taking
with
him
the
treasures
of
thenceforth
lost
to
men
bardsey
island
no
doubt
derives
its
name
from
this
story
and
what
is
probably
an
allusion
to
it
is
found
in
a
greek
writer
called
plutarch
who
describes
a
grammarian
called
demetrius
as
having
visited
britain
and
brought
home
an
account
of
his
travels
he
mentioned
several
uninhabited
and
sacred
islands
off
our
coasts
which
he
said
were
named
after
gods
and
heroes
but
there
was
one
especially
in
which
cronos
was
imprisoned
with
his
attendant
deities
and
briareus
keeping
watch
over
him
as
he
slept
sleep
was
the
bond
forged
for
doubtless
this
disinherited
deity
whom
the
greek
after
his
fashion
called
was
the
british
and
after
he
had
descended
into
the
prison
of
the
west
among
other
is
kai
who
as
sir
kay
the
seneschal
fills
so
large
a
part
in
the
later
romances
purged
of
his
worst
offences
and
reduced
to
a
surly
butler
to
arthur
he
is
but
a
shadow
of
the
earlier
kai
who
murdered
son
llacheu
and
can
only
be
acquitted
through
the
obscurity
of
the
poem
that
relates
the
incident
of
having
also
carried
off
or
having
tried
to
carry
off
wife
gwynhwyvar
he
is
thought
to
have
been
a
personification
of
fire
upon
the
strength
of
a
description
given
of
him
in
the
mythical
romance
of
and
it
says
kai
when
it
pleased
him
he
could
render
himself
as
tall
as
the
highest
tree
in
the
forest
and
he
had
another
great
was
the
heat
of
his
nature
that
when
it
rained
hardest
whatever
he
carried
remained
dry
for
a
handbreadth
above
and
a
handbreadth
below
his
hand
and
when
his
companions
were
coldest
it
was
to
them
as
fuel
with
which
to
light
their
another
personage
who
owes
his
prominence
in
the
arthurian
story
to
his
importance
in
celtic
myth
was
march
son
of
meirchion
whose
swine
arthur
attempted
to
steal
as
gwydion
had
done
those
of
pryderi
in
the
romances
he
has
become
the
cowardly
and
treacherous
mark
king
according
to
some
stories
of
cornwall
but
according
to
others
of
the
whole
of
britain
and
known
to
all
as
the
husband
of
the
fair
isoult
and
the
uncle
of
sir
tristrem
but
as
a
deformed
deity
of
the
underworld
he
can
be
found
in
gaelic
as
well
as
in
british
myth
he
can
not
be
considered
as
originally
different
from
morc
a
king
of
the
fomors
at
the
time
when
from
their
glass
castle
they
so
fatally
oppressed
the
children
of
nemed
the
fomors
were
distinguished
by
their
animal
features
and
march
had
the
same
peculiarity
when
sir
thomas
malory
relates
how
to
please
arthur
and
sir
launcelot
sir
dinadan
made
a
song
about
mark
was
the
worst
lay
that
ever
harper
sang
with
harp
or
any
other
instruments
he
does
not
tell
us
wherein
the
sting
of
the
lampoon
lay
it
no
doubt
reminded
king
mark
of
the
unpleasant
fact
that
he
like
his
phrygian
counterpart
ears
he
was
in
fact
a
celtic
midas
a
distinction
which
he
shared
with
one
of
the
mythical
kings
of
early
ireland
neither
can
we
pass
over
urien
a
deity
of
the
underworld
akin
to
or
perhaps
the
same
as
brân
like
that
son
of
llyr
he
was
at
once
a
god
of
battle
and
of
minstrelsy
he
was
adored
by
the
bards
as
their
patron
his
badge
was
the
raven
in
welsh
while
to
make
his
identification
complete
there
is
an
extant
poem
which
tells
how
urien
wounded
ordered
his
own
head
to
be
cut
off
by
his
attendants
his
wife
was
modron
known
as
the
mother
of
mabon
the
to
whom
inscriptions
exist
as
another
of
the
children
of
urien
and
modron
is
owain
which
was
perhaps
only
another
name
for
mabon
taliesin
calls
him
of
the
glittering
and
he
is
as
certainly
a
as
his
father
urien
of
the
was
a
ruler
of
the
dark
underworld
it
is
by
reason
of
the
of
arthur
that
we
find
gathered
round
him
so
many
gods
all
probably
various
tribal
personifications
of
the
same
few
mythological
ideas
the
celts
both
of
the
gaelic
and
the
british
branches
were
split
up
into
numerous
petty
tribes
each
with
its
own
local
deities
embodying
the
same
essential
conceptions
under
different
names
there
was
the
god
of
the
underworld
gigantic
in
figure
patron
alike
of
warrior
and
minstrel
teacher
of
the
arts
of
eloquence
and
literature
and
owner
of
boundless
wealth
whom
some
of
the
british
tribes
worshipped
as
brân
others
as
urien
others
as
pwyll
or
march
or
mâth
or
arawn
or
ogyrvran
there
was
the
lord
of
an
in
its
aspect
of
a
paradise
of
the
departed
rather
than
of
the
primeval
subterranean
realm
where
all
the
britons
of
wales
called
gwyn
or
gwynwas
the
britons
of
cornwall
melwas
and
the
britons
of
somerset
avallon
or
avallach
under
this
last
title
his
realm
is
called
or
as
we
know
the
word
avilion
it
was
said
to
be
in
the
of
which
in
the
earliest
myth
signified
hades
and
it
was
only
in
later
days
that
the
mystic
isle
of
avilion
became
fixed
to
earth
as
glastonbury
and
the
elysian
of
as
somerset
there
was
a
mighty
ruler
of
heaven
a
of
worshipped
on
high
places
in
whose
hands
was
stern
arbitrament
of
some
knew
him
as
lludd
others
as
myrddin
or
as
emrys
there
was
a
gentler
deity
friendly
to
man
to
help
whom
he
fought
or
cajoled
the
powers
of
the
underworld
gwydion
he
was
called
and
arthur
last
perhaps
to
be
imagined
in
concrete
shape
there
was
a
who
aided
the
in
his
work
and
was
known
as
lleu
or
gwalchmei
or
mabon
or
owain
or
peredur
and
no
doubt
by
many
another
name
and
with
him
is
usually
found
a
brother
representing
not
light
but
darkness
this
expression
of
a
single
idea
by
different
names
may
be
also
observed
in
gaelic
myth
though
not
quite
so
clearly
in
the
hurtling
of
clan
against
clan
many
such
divinities
perished
altogether
out
of
memory
or
survived
only
as
names
to
make
up
in
ireland
the
vast
shadowy
population
claiming
to
be
tuatha
dé
danann
and
in
britain
the
long
list
of
followers
of
stronger
increase
their
fame
as
their
worshippers
increased
their
territory
until
as
happened
in
greece
the
chief
deities
of
many
tribes
came
together
to
form
a
national
pantheon
we
have
already
tried
to
explain
the
of
historically
mythologically
he
came
as
according
to
celtic
ideas
all
things
came
originally
from
the
underworld
his
father
is
called
uther
pendragon
but
uther
pendragon
is
for
the
word
is
not
part
of
the
name
but
a
title
signifying
that
is
brân
under
his
name
of
the
so
that
in
spite
of
the
legend
which
describes
arthur
as
having
disinterred
head
on
tower
hill
where
it
watched
against
invasion
because
he
thought
it
beneath
his
dignity
to
keep
britain
in
any
other
way
than
by
valour
we
must
recognize
the
king
of
hades
as
his
father
this
being
so
it
would
only
be
natural
that
he
should
take
a
wife
from
the
same
eternal
country
and
we
need
not
be
surprised
to
find
in
father
ogyrvran
a
personage
corresponding
in
all
respects
to
the
celtic
conception
of
the
ruler
of
the
underworld
he
was
of
gigantic
size
he
was
the
owner
of
a
cauldron
out
of
which
three
muses
had
been
born
and
he
was
the
patron
of
the
bards
who
deemed
him
to
have
been
the
originator
of
their
art
more
than
this
his
very
name
analysed
into
its
original
means
the
evil
or
raven
the
bird
of
death
but
welsh
tradition
credits
arthur
with
three
wives
each
of
them
called
gwynhwyvar
this
peculiar
arrangement
is
probably
due
to
the
celtic
love
of
triads
and
one
may
compare
them
with
the
three
etains
who
pass
through
the
story
of
eochaid
airem
etain
and
mider
of
these
three
gwynhwyvars
besides
the
gwynhwyvar
daughter
of
ogyrvran
one
was
the
daughter
of
gwyrd
gwent
of
whom
we
know
nothing
but
the
name
and
the
other
of
gwyrthur
ap
greidawl
the
same
son
of
with
whom
gwyn
son
of
nudd
fought
in
earlier
myth
perpetual
battle
for
the
possession
of
creudylad
daughter
of
the
lludd
this
same
eternal
strife
between
the
powers
of
light
and
darkness
for
the
possession
of
a
symbolical
damsel
is
waged
again
in
the
arthurian
cycle
but
it
is
no
longer
for
creudylad
that
gwyn
contends
but
for
gwynhwyvar
and
no
longer
with
gwyrthur
but
with
arthur
it
would
seem
to
have
been
a
cornish
form
of
the
myth
for
the
dark
god
is
called
and
not
or
his
name
in
welsh
melwas
lay
in
ambush
for
a
whole
year
and
finally
succeeded
in
carrying
off
gwynhwyvar
to
his
palace
in
avilion
but
arthur
pursued
and
besieged
that
stronghold
just
as
eochaid
airem
had
in
the
gaelic
version
of
the
universal
story
mined
and
sapped
at
of
bri
leith
mythology
as
well
as
history
repeats
itself
and
melwas
was
obliged
to
restore
gwynhwyvar
to
her
rightful
lord
it
is
not
melwas
however
that
in
the
versions
of
the
story
contends
with
arthur
for
the
love
of
gwynhwyvar
the
most
widespread
early
tradition
makes
rival
his
nephew
medrawt
here
professor
rhys
traces
a
striking
parallel
between
the
british
legend
of
arthur
gwynhwyvar
and
medrawt
and
the
gaelic
story
of
airem
etain
and
mider
the
two
myths
are
practically
counterparts
for
the
names
of
all
the
three
pairs
agree
in
their
essential
meaning
like
signifies
the
the
divine
institutor
of
agriculture
the
is
a
fit
parallel
to
the
while
and
both
come
from
the
same
root
a
word
meaning
either
literally
or
else
metaphorically
with
the
mind
in
the
sense
of
coming
to
a
decision
to
attempt
to
explain
this
myth
is
to
raise
the
vexed
question
of
the
meaning
of
mythology
is
it
day
and
dark
that
strive
for
dawn
or
summer
and
winter
for
the
lovely
spring
or
does
it
shadow
forth
the
rescue
of
the
grain
that
makes
life
from
the
devouring
underworld
by
the
wit
when
this
can
be
finally
resolved
a
multitude
of
celtic
myths
will
be
explained
everywhere
arise
the
same
combatants
for
the
stolen
bride
one
has
the
attributes
of
light
the
other
is
a
champion
of
darkness
even
in
sir
thomas
version
of
the
arthurian
story
taken
by
him
from
french
romances
far
removed
from
the
original
tradition
we
find
the
myth
subsisting
original
place
as
the
lover
of
queen
had
been
taken
in
the
romances
by
sir
launcelot
who
if
he
was
not
some
now
undiscoverable
celtic
god
must
have
been
an
invention
of
the
norman
adapters
but
the
story
which
makes
medrawt
rival
has
been
preserved
in
the
account
of
how
sir
mordred
would
have
wedded
guinevere
by
force
as
part
of
the
rebellion
which
he
made
against
his
king
and
uncle
this
strife
was
celtic
myth
long
before
it
became
part
of
the
of
early
britain
the
triads
tell
us
how
arthur
and
medrawt
raided
each
courts
during
the
absence
medrawt
went
to
kelli
wic
in
cornwall
ate
and
drank
everything
he
could
find
there
and
insulted
queen
gwynhwyvar
in
revenge
for
which
arthur
went
to
court
and
killed
man
and
beast
their
struggle
only
ended
with
the
battle
of
camlan
and
that
mythical
combat
which
chroniclers
have
striven
to
make
historical
is
full
of
legendary
detail
tradition
tells
how
arthur
and
his
antagonist
shared
their
forces
three
times
during
the
fight
which
caused
it
to
be
known
as
one
of
the
frivolous
battles
of
the
idea
of
doing
so
being
one
of
three
criminal
four
alone
survived
the
fray
one
because
he
was
so
ugly
that
all
shrank
from
him
believing
him
to
be
a
devil
another
whom
no
one
touched
because
he
was
so
beautiful
that
they
took
him
for
an
angel
a
third
whose
great
strength
no
one
could
resist
and
arthur
himself
who
after
revenging
the
death
of
gwalchmei
upon
medrawt
went
to
the
island
of
avilion
to
heal
him
of
his
grievous
wounds
and
the
elysium
of
the
belief
has
always
been
that
he
will
some
day
return
but
just
as
the
gods
of
the
gaels
are
said
to
dwell
sometimes
in
the
of
the
beyond
the
western
wave
and
sometimes
in
the
palace
of
a
hollow
hill
so
arthur
is
sometimes
thought
to
be
in
avilion
and
sometimes
to
be
sitting
with
his
champions
in

no
doubt
more
strictly
correct
than
the
famous
rendering
is
the
grave
of
chapter
xxii
the
treasures
of
britain
it
is
in
keeping
with
the
mythological
character
of
arthur
that
the
early
welsh
tales
recorded
of
him
are
of
a
different
nature
from
those
which
swell
the
of
nennius
and
of
geoffrey
of
monmouth
we
hear
nothing
of
that
subjugation
of
the
countries
of
western
europe
which
fills
so
large
a
part
in
the
two
books
of
the
which
geoffrey
has
devoted
to
him
conqueror
he
is
but
his
conquests
are
not
in
any
land
known
to
geographers
it
is
against
hades
and
not
against
rome
that
he
achieves
his
highest
triumphs
this
is
the
true
history
of
king
arthur
and
we
may
read
more
fragments
and
snatches
of
it
in
two
preserved
in
the
red
book
of
hergest
both
these
tales
date
in
the
actual
form
in
which
they
have
come
down
to
us
from
the
twelfth
century
but
in
each
of
them
the
writer
seems
to
be
stretching
out
his
hands
to
gather
in
the
dying
traditions
of
a
very
remote
past
when
a
welsh
named
rhonabwy
lay
down
one
night
to
sleep
upon
a
yellow
the
only
furniture
in
a
noisome
hut
in
which
he
had
taken
shelter
that
was
comparatively
free
from
vermin
he
had
the
vision
which
is
related
in
the
tale
called
dream
of
he
thought
that
he
was
travelling
with
his
companions
towards
the
severn
when
they
heard
a
rushing
noise
behind
them
and
looking
back
saw
a
gigantic
rider
upon
a
monstrous
horse
so
terrible
was
the
appearance
that
they
all
started
to
run
from
him
but
their
running
was
of
no
avail
for
every
time
the
horse
drew
in
its
breath
it
sucked
them
back
to
its
very
chest
only
however
to
fling
them
forward
as
it
breathed
out
again
in
despair
they
fell
down
and
besought
their
mercy
he
granted
it
asked
their
names
and
told
them
in
return
his
own
he
was
known
as
iddawc
the
agitator
of
britain
for
it
was
he
who
in
his
love
of
war
had
purposely
precipitated
the
battle
of
camlan
arthur
had
sent
him
to
reason
with
medrawt
but
though
arthur
had
charged
him
with
the
fairest
sayings
he
could
think
of
iddawc
translated
them
into
the
harshest
he
could
devise
but
he
had
done
seven
penance
and
had
been
forgiven
and
was
now
riding
to
camp
thither
he
insisted
upon
taking
rhonabwy
and
his
companions

encamped
for
a
mile
around
the

sides

when
he
came
back
to

after

marvelled
at
the
puny
size
of
the
people
whom
iddawc
had
brought

him
to
look
at

up
yonder
on

the
emperor
smiled
said
iddawc
dost
thou
laugh

arthur
laugh
not
but
it
pitieth
me
that
men
of
such
stature
as
these
should
have
this
island
in
their
keeping
after
the
men
that
guarded
it
of

he
turned
away
and
iddawc
told
rhonabwy
and
his
companions
to
keep
silent
and
they
would
see
what
they
would
see
the
scope
of
such
a
book
as
this
allows
no
space
to
describe
the
persons
and
equipments
of
the
warriors
who
came
riding
down
with
their
companies
to
join
arthur
as
he
made
his
great
march
to
fight
the
battle
of
badon

by
some
to
be
historical
and
located
at

the
reader
who
turns

tale

will
see

rhonabwy
saw

three

nights
that
he
slept

dreamed
upon

this
story
of
the
of
elaborate
as
it
is
in
all
its
details
is
yet
in
substance
little
more
than
a
catalogue
the
intention
of
its
unknown
author
seems
to
have
been
to
draw
a
series
of
pictures
of
what
he
considered
to
be
the
principal
among
followers
the
other
of
and
takes
this
catalogue
form
but
the
matters

are
of
a
different
kind
it
is
not
so
much
a
record
of
men
as
of
things
not
the
heroes
of
britain
but
the
treasures
of
britain
are
its
subject
one
might
compare
it
with
the
gaelic
story
of
the
adventures
of
the
three
sons
of
tuirenn
the
treasures
of
were
famous
in
early
legend
they
belonged
to
gods
and
heroes
and
were
current
in
our
island
till
the
end
of
the
divine
age
when
merlin
fading
out
of
the
world
took
them
with
him
into
his
airy
tomb
never
to
be
seen
by
mortal
eyes
again
according
to
tradition
they
consisted
of
a
sword
a
basket
a
a
chariot
a
halter
a
knife
a
cauldron
a
whetstone
a
garment
a
pan
a
platter
a
and
a
mantle
all
possessed
of
not
less
marvellous
qualities
than
the
apples
the
the
spear
the
horses
and
chariot
the
pigs
the
and
the
which
the
sons
of
tuirenn
obtained
for
lugh
it
is
these
same
legendary
treasures
that
reappear
no
doubt
in
the
story
of
and
the
number
tallies
for
there
are
thirteen
of
them
some
are
certainly
and
others
probably
identical
with
those
of
the
other
tradition
that
there
should
be
discrepancies
need
cause
no
surprise
for
it
is
not
unlikely
that
there
were
several
different
versions
of
their
legend
everyone
had
heard
of
the
thirteen
treasures
of
britain
many
no
doubt
disputed
as
to
what
they
were
others
might
ask
whence
they
came
the
story
of
and
was
composed
to
tell
them
they
were
won
by
arthur
and
his
mighty
men
kulhwch
is
the
hero
of
the
story
and
olwen
is
its
heroine
but
only
as
it
were
by
courtesy
the
pair
provide
a
which
as
in
the
tales
of
all
primitive
people
is
kept
in
the
background
the
woman
in
such
romances
takes
the
place
of
the
gold
and
gems
in
a
modern
story
she
is
won
by
overcoming
external
obstacles
and
not
by
any
difficulty
in
obtaining
her
own
consent
in
this
romance
kulhwch
was
the
son
of
a
king
who
afterwards
married
a
widow
with
a
daughter
whom
his
stepmother
urged
kulhwch
to
marry
on
his
modestly
replying
that
he
was
not
yet
of
an
age
to
wed
she
laid
the
destiny
on
him
that
he
should
never
have
a
wife
at
all
unless
he
could
win
olwen
the
daughter
of
a
terrible
father
called
chief
of
the
of
was
as
hostile
to
suitors
as
he
was
monstrous
in
shape
and
no
wonder
for
he
knew
that
on
his
marriage
his
own
life
would
come
to
an
end
both
in
this
peculiarity
and
in
the
description
of
his
ponderous
eyebrows
which
fell
so
heavily
over
his
eyes
that
he
could
not
see
until
they
had
been
lifted
up
with
forks
he
reminds
one
of
the
fomor
balor
of
his
daughter
on
the
other
hand
the
welsh
tale
gives
a
description
as
beautiful
as
olwen
was
herself
yellow
was
her
head
than
the
flower
of
the
broom
and
her
skin
was
whiter
than
the
foam
of
the
wave
and
fairer
were
her
hands
and
her
fingers
than
the
blossoms
of
the
wood
anemone
amidst
the
spray
of
the
the
eye
of
the
trained
hawk
the
glance
of
the
falcon
was
not
brighter
than
hers
her
bosom
was
more
snowy
than
the
breast
of
the
white
swan
her
cheek
was
redder
than
the
reddest
roses
whoso
beheld
her
was
filled
with
her
love
four
white
trefoils
sprung
up
wherever
she
trod
and
therefore

she
called

no
need

fall
in
love
with

blushed
at
her
very
name
and
asked
his
father
how
he
could
obtain
her
in
marriage
his
father
reminded
him
that
he
was
cousin
and
advised
him
to
claim
olwen
from
him
as
a
boon
so
kulhwch
forth
upon
a
steed
with
head
dappled
grey
of
four
winters
old
firm
of
limb
with
hoofs
having
a
bridle
of
linked
gold
on
his
head
and
upon
him
a
saddle
of
costly
gold
and
in
the
hand
were
two
spears
of
silver
sharp
headed
with
steel
three
ells
in
length
of
an
edge
to
wound
the
wind
and
cause
blood
to
flow
and
swifter
than
the
fall
of
the
dewdrop
from
the
blade
of
upon
the
earth
when
the
dew
of
june
is
at
the
heaviest
a
sword
was
upon
his
thigh
the
blade
of
which
was
of
gold
bearing
a
cross
of
inlaid
gold
of
the
hue
of
the
lightning
of
heaven
his
was
of
ivory
before
him
were
two
brindled
greyhounds
having
strong
collars
of
rubies
about
their
necks
reaching
from
the
shoulder
to
the
ear
and
the
one
that
was
on
the
left
side
bounded
across
to
the
right
side
and
the
one
on
the
right
to
the
left
and
like
two
sported
around
him
and
his
courser
cast
up
four
sods
with
his
four
hoofs
like
four
swallows
in
the
air
about
his
head
now
above
now
below
about
him
was
a
cloth
of
purple
and
an
apple
of
gold
was
at
each
corner
and
every
one
of
the
apples
was
of
the
value
of
an
hundred
kine
and
there
was
precious
gold
of
the
value
of
three
hundred
kine
upon
his
shoes
and
upon
his
stirrups
from
his
knee
to
the
tip
of
his
toe
and
the
blade
of
grass
bent
not
beneath
him
so
light
was
his
tread
as
he
journeyed
towards
the
gate
of
nor
did
this
bold
suitor
stand
greatly
upon
ceremony
he
arrived
after
the
portal
of
the
palace
had
been
closed
for
the
night
and
contrary
to
all
precedent
sent
to
arthur
demanding
instant
entry
although
too
it
was
the
custom
for
visitors
to
dismount
at
the
at
the
gate
he
did
not
do
so
but
rode
his
charger
into
the
hall
after
greetings
had
passed
between
him
and
arthur
and
he
had
announced
his
name
he
demanded
olwen
for
his
bride
at
the
hands
of
the
emperor
and
his
warriors
neither
arthur
nor
any
of
his
court
had
ever
heard
of
olwen
however
he
promised
his
cousin
either
to
find
her
for
him
or
to
prove
that
there
was
no
such
person
he
ordered
his
most
skilful
warriors
to
accompany
kulhwch
kai
with
his
companion
bedwyr
the
swiftest
of
men
kynddelig
who
was
as
good
a
guide
in
a
strange
country
as
in
his
own
gwrhyr
who
knew
all
the
languages
of
men
as
well
as
of
all
other
creatures
gwalchmei
who
never
left
an
adventure
unachieved
and
menw
who
could
render
himself
and
his
companions
invisible
at
will
they
travelled
until
they
came
to
a
castle
on
an
open
plain
feeding
on
the
plain
was
a
countless
herd
of
sheep
and
on
a
mound
close
by
a
monstrous
shepherd
with
a
monstrous
dog
menw
cast
a
spell
over
the
dog
and
they
approached
the
shepherd
he
was
called
custennin
a
brother
of
hawthorn
while
his
wife
was
a
sister
of
own
mother
the
evil
chief
of
giants
had
reduced
his
brother
to
servitude
and
murdered
all
his
sons
save
one
who
was
kept
hidden
in
a
stone
chest
therefore
he
welcomed
kulhwch
and
the
embassy
from
arthur
and
promised
to
help
them
secretly
the
more
readily
since
kai
offered
to
take
the
one
surviving
son
under
his
protection
wife
procured
kulhwch
a
secret
meeting
with
olwen
and
the
damsel
did
not
altogether
discourage
her
suit
the
party
started
for
castle
without
raising
any
alarm
they
slew
the
nine
porters
and
the
nine
and
came
unhindered
into
the
hall
they
greeted
the
ponderous
giant
and
announced
the
reason
of
their
coming
are
my
pages
and
my
servants
he
said
up
the
forks
beneath
my
two
eyebrows
which
have
fallen
over
my
eyes
so
that
i
may
see
the
fashion
of
my
he
glared
at
them
and
told
them
to
come
again
upon
the
next
day
they
turned
to
go
and
as
they
did
so
hawthorn
seized
a
poisoned
dart
and
threw
it
after
them
but
bedwyr
caught
it
and
cast
it
back
wounding
the
knee
they
left
him
grumbling
slept
at
the
house
of
custennin
and
returned
the
next
morning
again
they
demanded
olwen
from
her
father
threatening
him
with
death
if
he
refused
four
and
her
four
are
yet
alive
replied
hawthorn
is
needful
that
i
take
counsel
of
so
they
turned
away
and
as
they
went
he
flung
a
second
dart
which
menw
caught
and
hurled
back
piercing
the
body
the
next
time
they
came
hawthorn
warned
them
not
to
shoot
at
him
again
unless
they
desired
death
then
he
ordered
his
eyebrows
to
be
lifted
up
and
as
soon
as
he
could
see
he
flung
a
poisoned
dart
straight
at
kulhwch
but
the
suitor
himself
caught
it
and
flung
it
back
so
that
it
pierced
eyeball
and
came
out
through
the
back
of
his
head
here
again
we
are
reminded
of
the
myth
of
lugh
and
balor
hawthorn
however
was
not
killed
though
he
was
very
much
discomforted
cursed
ungentle
truly
he
complained
long
as
i
remain
alive
my
eyesight
will
be
the
worse
whenever
i
go
against
the
wind
my
eyes
will
water
and
peradventure
my
head
will
burn
and
i
shall
have
a
giddiness
every
new
moon
cursed
be
the
fire
in
which
it
was
forged
like
the
bite
of
a
mad
dog
is
the
stroke
of
this
poisoned
it
was
now
the
turn
of
kulhwch
and
his
party
to
warn
the
giant
that
there
must
be
no
more
he
appeared
indeed
more
amenable
to
reason
and
allowed
himself
to
be
placed
opposite
to
kulhwch
in
a
chair
to
discuss
the
amount
of
his
its
terms
as
he
gradually
unfolded
them
were
terrific
the
paid
for
cian
to
lugh
seems
indeed
a
trifle
beside
it
to
obtain
grain
for
food
and
liquor
at
his
wedding
a
vast
hill
which
he
showed
to
kulhwch
must
be
rooted
up
levelled
ploughed
sown
and
harvested
in
one
day
no
one
could
do
this
except
amaethon
son
of
dôn
the
divine
husbandman
and
govannan
son
of
dôn
the
divine
smith
and
they
must
have
the
service
of
three
pairs
of
magic
oxen
he
must
also
have
returned
to
him
the
same
nine
bushels
of
flax
which
he
had
sown
in
his
youth
and
which
had
never
come
up
for
only
out
of
this
very
flax
should
be
made
the
white
wimple
for
head
for
mead
too
he
must
have
honey
times
sweeter
than
the
honey
of
the
virgin
then
followed
the
enumeration
of
the
thirteen
treasures
to
be
paid
to
him
as
dowry
such
a
list
of
wedding
presents
was
surely
never
known
no
pot
could
hold
such
honey
as
he
demanded
but
the
magic
vessel
of
llwyr
the
son
of
llwyryon
there
would
not
be
enough
food
for
all
the
unless
he
had
the
basket
of
gwyddneu
garanhir
from
which
all
the
men
in
the
world
could
be
fed
thrice
nine
at
a
time
no
cauldron
could
cook
the
meat
except
that
of
diwrnach
the
gael
the
mystic
of
gwlgawd
gododin
must
be
there
to
give
them
drink
the
harp
of
teirtu
which
like
the
played
of
itself
must
make
music
for
them
the
giant
hair
could
only
be
shorn
with
one
tusk
of
king
of
the
boars
and
not
even
by
that
unless
it
was
plucked
alive
out
of
its
mouth
also
before
the
hair
could
be
cut
it
must
be
spread
out
and
this
could
not
be
done
until
it
had
been
first
softened
with
the
blood
of
the
perfectly
black
sorceress
daughter
of
the
perfectly
white
sorceress
from
the
source
of
the
stream
of
sorrow
on
the
borders
of
hell
nor
could
the
blood
be
kept
warm
enough
unless
it
was
placed
in
the
bottles
of
gwyddolwyn
gorr
which
preserved
the
heat
of
any
liquor
put
into
them
though
it
was
carried
from
the
east
of
the
world
to
the
west
another
set
of
bottles
he
must
also
have
to
keep
milk
for
his
guests
bottles
of
rhinnon
rhin
barnawd
in
which
no
drink
ever
turned
sour
for
himself
he
required
the
sword
of
gwrnach
the
giant
which
that
personage
would
never
allow
out
of
his
own
keeping
because
it
was
destined
that
he
himself
should
fall
by
it
last
of
all
he
must
be
given
the
comb
the
razor
and
the
scissors
which
lay
between
the
ears
of
twrch
trwyth
a
king
changed
into
the
most
terrible
of
wild
boars
it
is
the
chase
of
this
boar
which
gives
the
story
of
and
its
alternative
twrch
the
task
was
one
worthy
of
gods
and
its
contemplation
might
well
have
appalled
kulhwch
who
however
was
not
so
easily
frightened
to
every
fresh
demand
every
new
obstacle
put
in
his
way
he
gave
the
same
answer
will
be
easy
for
me
to
compass
this
although
thou
mayest
think
that
it
will
not
be
whether
it
was
easy
or
not
will
be
seen
from
the
conditions
under
which
alone
the
hunt
could
be
brought
to
a
successful
end
no
ordinary
hounds
or
huntsmen
would
avail
the
chief
of
the
pack
must
be
drudwyn
the
whelp
of
greid
the
son
of
eri
led
in
the
one
leash
that
would
hold
him
fastened
by
the
one
chain
strong
enough
to
the
one
collar
that
would
contain
his
neck
no
huntsman
could
hunt
with
this
dog
except
mabon
son
of
modron
and
he
had
ages
before
been
taken
from
between
his
mother
and
the
wall
when
he
was
three
nights
old
and
it
was
not
known
where
he
was
or
even
whether
he
were
living
or
dead
there
was
only
one
steed
that
could
carry
mabon
namely
gwynn
mygdwn
the
horse
of
gweddw
two
other
marvellous
hounds
the
cubs
of
gast
rhymhi
must
also
be
obtained
they
must
be
held
in
the
only
leash
they
would
not
break
for
it
would
be
made
out
of
the
beard
of
the
giant
dissull
plucked
from
him
while
he
was
still
alive
even
with
this
no
huntsman
could
lead
them
except
kynedyr
wyllt
who
was
himself
nine
times
more
wild
than
the
wildest
beast
upon
the
mountains
all
mighty
men
must
come
to
help
even
gwyn
son
of
nudd
upon
his
black
horse
and
how
could
he
be
spared
from
his
terrible
duty
of
restraining
the
devils
in
hell
from
breaking
loose
and
destroying
the
world
here
is
material
for
romance
indeed
but
unhappily
we
shall
never
know
the
full
story
of
how
all
these
magic
treasures
were
obtained
all
these
magic
hounds
captured
and
compelled
to
hunt
all
these
magic
huntsmen
brought
to
help
the
nutt
considers
to
be
the
finest
tales
of
the
the
greatest
romantic
fairy
tale
the
world
has
ever
not
as
we
have
it
now
complete
it
reads
fully
enough
but
on
casting
backwards
and
forwards
between
the
list
of
feats
to
be
performed
and
the
body
of
the
tale
which
is
supposed
to
relate
them
all
we
find
many
of
them
wanting
host
of
we
are
told
themselves
into
parties
of
one
and
each
party
intent
upon
some
separate
quest
the
adventures
of
some
of
them
have
come
down
but
those
of
others
have
not
we
are
told
how
kai
slew
gwrnach
the
giant
with
his
own
sword
how
gwyrthur
son
of
greidawl
rival
for
the
love
of
creudylad
saved
an
anthill
from
fire
and
how
the
grateful
ants
searched
for
and
found
the
very
sown
by
hawthorn
in
his
youth
how
host
surrounded
and
took
gast
cubs
and
how
kai
and
bedwyr
overcame
dissull
and
plucked
out
his
beard
with
wooden
tweezers
to
make
a
leash
for
them
we
learn
how
arthur
went
to
ireland
and
brought
back
the
cauldron
of
diwrnach
the
gael
full
of
irish
money
how
the
was
chased
and
killed
and
how
arthur
condescended
to
slay
the
perfectly
black
sorceress
with
his
own
hand
that
others
of
the
treasures
were
acquired
is
hinted
rather
than
said
most
important
of
all
for
so
much
depended
on
him
we
find
out
where
the
stolen
mabon
was
and
learn
how
he
was
rescued
so
many
ages
had
elapsed
since
mabon
had
disappeared
that
there
seemed
little
hope
of
ever
finding
news
of
him
nevertheless
gwrhyr
who
spoke
the
languages
of
all
creatures
went
to
enquire
of
that
ancient
bird
the
ousel
of
cilgwri
but
the
ousel
though
in
her
time
she
had
pecked
a
anvil
down
to
the
size
of
a
nut
was
yet
too
young
to
have
heard
of
mabon
she
sent
gwrhyr
to
a
creature
formed
before
her
the
stag
of
redynvre
but
though
the
stag
had
lived
to
see
an
slowly
grow
to
be
a
tree
with
a
thousand
branches
and
as
slowly
decay
again
till
it
was
a
withered
stump
he
had
never
heard
of
mabon
therefore
he
sent
him
on
to
a
creature
still
older
than
owl
of
cwm
cawlwyd
the
wood
she
lived
in
had
been
thrice
rooted
up
and
had
thrice
itself
and
yet
in
all
that
immense
time
she
had
never
heard
of
mabon
there
was
but
one
who
might
have
she
told
gwrhyr
and
he
was
the
eagle
of
gwern
abwy
here
at
last
they
struck
trail
eagle
said
have
been
here
for
a
great
space
of
time
and
when
i
first
came
hither
there
was
a
rock
here
from
the
top
of
which
i
pecked
at
the
stars
every
evening
and
now
it
is
not
so
much
as
a
span
high
from
that
day
to
this
i
have
been
here
and
i
have
never
heard
of
the
man
for
whom
you
inquire
except
once
when
i
went
in
search
of
food
as
far
as
llyn
llyw
and
when
i
came
there
i
struck
my
talons
into
a
salmon
thinking
he
would
serve
me
as
food
for
a
long
time
but
he
drew
me
into
the
deep
and
i
was
scarcely
able
to
escape
from
him
after
that
i
went
with
my
whole
kindred
to
attack
him
and
to
try
to
destroy
him
but
he
sent
messengers
and
made
peace
with
me
and
came
and
besought
me
to
take
fifty
fish
spears
out
of
his
back
unless
he
know
something
of
him
whom
you
seek
i
can
not
tell
who
may
however
i
will
guide
you
to
the
place
where
he
it
happened
that
the
salmon
did
know
with
every
tide
he
went
up
the
severn
as
far
as
the
walls
of
gloucester
and
there
he
said
he
had
found
such
wrong
as
he
had
never
found
anywhere
else
so
he
took
kai
and
gwrhyr
upon
his
shoulders
and
carried
them
to
the
wall
of
the
prison
where
a
captive
was
heard
lamenting
this
was
mabon
son
of
modron
who
was
suffering
such
imprisonment
as
not
even
lludd
of
the
silver
hand
or
greid
the
son
of
eri
the
other
two
of
the
paramount
prisoners
of
had
endured
before
him
but
it
came
to
an
end
now
for
kai
sent
to
arthur
and
he
and
his
warriors
stormed
gloucester
and
brought
mabon
away
all
was
at
last
ready
for
the
final
hunting
of
twrch
trwyth
who
was
now
with
his
seven
young
pigs
in
ireland
before
he
was
roused
it
was
thought
wise
to
send
the
wizard
menw
to
find
out
by
ocular
inspection
whether
the
comb
the
scissors
and
the
razor
were
still
between
his
ears
menw
took
the
form
of
a
bird
and
settled
upon
the
head
he
saw
the
coveted
treasures
and
tried
to
take
one
of
them
but
twrch
trwyth
shook
himself
so
violently
that
some
of
the
venom
from
his
bristles
spurted
over
menw
who
was
never
quite
well
again
from
that
day
then
the
hunt
was
up
the
men
surrounded
him
and
the
dogs
were
loosed
at
him
from
every
side
on
the
first
day
the
irish
attacked
him
on
the
second
day
household
encountered
him
and
were
worsted
then
arthur
himself
fought
with
him
for
nine
days
and
nine
nights
without
even
killing
one
of
the
little
pigs
a
truce
was
now
called
so
that
gwrhyr
who
spoke
all
languages
might
go
and
parley
with
him
gwrhyr
begged
him
to
give
up
in
peace
the
comb
the
scissors
and
the
razor
which
were
all
that
arthur
wanted
but
the
boar
trwyth
indignant
of
having
been
so
annoyed
would
not
on
the
contrary
he
promised
to
go
on
the
morrow
into
country
and
do
all
the
harm
he
could
there
so
twrch
trwyth
with
his
seven
pigs
crossed
the
sea
into
wales
and
arthur
followed
with
his
warriors
in
the
ship
here
the
story
becomes
wonderfully
realistic
and
circumstantial
we
are
told
of
every
place
they
passed
through
on
the
long
chase
through
south
wales
and
can
trace
the
course
of
the
hunt
over
the
map
we
know
of
every
check
the
huntsmen
had
and
what
happened
every
time
the
boars
turned
to
bay
the
of
men
is
completely
given
and
we
can
also
follow
the
shrinking
of
twrch
herd
as
his
little
pigs
fell
one
by
one
none
were
left
but
trwyth
himself
by
the
time
the
severn
estuary
was
reached
at
the
mouth
of
the
wye
here
the
hunt
came
up
with
him
and
drove
him
into
the
water
and
in
this
unfamiliar
element
he
was
outmatched
osla
manawyddan
son
of
llyr
kacmwri
the
servant
of
arthur
and
gwyngelli
caught
him
by
his
four
feet
and
plunged
his
head
under
water
while
the
two
chief
huntsmen
mabon
son
of
modron
and
kyledyr
willt
came
one
on
each
side
of
him
and
took
the
scissors
and
the
razor
before
they
could
get
the
comb
however
he
shook
himself
free
and
struck
out
for
cornwall
leaving
osla
and
kacmwri
in
the
severn
and
all
this
trouble
we
are
told
was
mere
play
compared
with
the
trouble
they
had
with
him
in
cornwall
before
they
could
get
the
comb
but
at
last
they
secured
it
and
drove
the
boar
out
over
the
deep
sea
he
passed
out
of
sight
with
two
of
the
magic
hounds
in
pursuit
of
him
and
none
of
them
have
ever
been
heard
of
since
the
sight
of
these
treasures
paraded
before
hawthorn
chief
of
giants
was
of
course
his
all
who
wished
him
ill
came
to
gloat
over
his
downfall
but
they
should
have
been
put
to
shame
by
the
giant
whose
end
had
at
least
a
certain
dignity
he
said
to
kulhwch
yours
but
you
need
not
thank
me
for
it
but
arthur

has
accomplished
all
this
by

arthur
and
his

came
before

they
would
seek

a
narrow
place
where
they

would
lay

of

and
of

adjacent

the
gods
as
king
knights
it
is
not
however
by
such
fragments
of
legend
that
arthur
is
best
known
to
english
readers
not
arthur
the
god
but
arthur
the
who
founded
the
table
round
from
which
he
sent
forth
his
knights
ride
abroad
redressing
human
is
the
figure
which
the
name
conjures
up
nor
is
it
even
from
sir
thomas
morte
darthur
that
this
conception
comes
to
most
of
us
but
from
of
the
but
tennyson
has
so
modernized
the
ancient
tradition
that
it
retains
little
of
the
old
arthur
but
the
name
he
tells
us
himself
that
his
poem
had
but
very
slight
relation
gray
king
whose
name
a
ghost
streams
like
a
cloud
from
and
cleaves
to
cairn
and
cromlech
still
or
him
of
book
or
him
of
but
that
he
merely
used
the
legend
to
give
a
substantial
form
to
his
ideal
figure
of
the
perfect
english
title
to
which
the
original
arthur
could
scarcely
have
laid
claim
still
less
does
there
remain
in
it
the
least
trace
of
anything
that
could
suggest
mythology
as
much
as
this
however
might
be
said
of
book
we
may
be
fairly
certain
that
the
good
sir
thomas
had
no
idea
that
the
personages
of
whom
he
wrote
had
ever
been
anything
different
from
the
christian
knights
which
they
had
become
in
the
late
french
romances
from
which
he
compiled
his
own
work
the
old
gods
had
been
from
time
to
time
very
completely
euhemerized
the
characters
of
the
branches
of
the
are
still
recognizable
as
divine
beings
in
the
later
welsh
stories
however
their
divinity
merely
hangs
about
them
in
shreds
and
tatters
and
the
first
norman
adapters
of
these
stories
made
them
still
more
definitely
human
by
the
time
malory
came
to
build
up
his
morte
darthur
from
the
foreign
romances
they
had
altered
so
much
that
the
shapes
and
deeds
of
gods
could
only
be
recognized
under
their
mediæval
knightly
disguises
by
those
who
had
known
them
in
their
ancient
forms
we
have
chosen
morte
darthur
as
almost
the
sole
representative
of
arthurian
literature
later
than
the
welsh
poems
and
prose
stories
for
three
reasons
firstly
because
it
is
the
english
arthurian
romance
from
which
all
later
english
authors
including
tennyson
have
drawn
their
material
secondly
because
the
mass
of
foreign
literature
dealing
with
the
subject
of
arthur
is
in
itself
a
and
could
not
by
any
possibility
be
compressed
within
the
limits
of
a
chapter
thirdly
because
fine
judgment
caused
him
to
choose
the
best
and
most
typical
foreign
tales
to
weave
into
his
own
romance
and
hence
it
is
that
we
find
most
of
our
old
british
those
of
the
earlier
cycle
and
those
of
the
system
connected
with
disguised
through
his
pages
curiously
enough
sir
edward
strachey
in
his
preface
to
the
edition
of
morte
darthur
uses
almost
the
same
image
to
describe
that
matthew
arnold
handled
with
such
effect
in
his
of
celtic
to
point
out
the
real
nature
of
the
mabinogion
he
says
built
a
great
rambling
mediæval
castle
the
walls
of
which
enclose
rude
and
even
ruinous
work
of
earlier
how
rude
and
how
ruinous
these
relics
were
malory
doubtless
had
not
the
least
idea
for
he
has
completely
jumbled
the
ancient
mythology
not
only
do
gods
of
the
older
and
newer
order
appear
together
but
the
same
deities
under
very
often
only
slightly
varying
names
come
up
again
and
again
as
totally
different
characters
take
for
example
the
ancient
deity
of
death
and
hades
as
king
brandegore
or
brandegoris
brân
of
gower
he
brings
five
thousand
mounted
men
to
oppose
king
arthur
but
as
sir
brandel
or
brandiles
brân
of
gwales
he
is
a
valiant
knight
of
the
round
table
who
dies
fighting
in
service
again
under
his
name
of
uther
pendragon
uther
ben
he
is
father
though
as
king
ban
of
benwyk
the
doubtless
the
same
as
and
he
is
a
foreign
monarch
who
is
ally
yet
again
as
the
father
of
guinevere
ogyrvran
has
become
leodegrance
as
king
uriens
or
urience
of
gore
gower
he
marries
one
of
sisters
fights
against
him
but
finally
tenders
his
submission
and
is
enrolled
among
his
knights
urien
may
also
be
identified
in
the
morte
darthur
as
king
rience
or
ryons
of
north
wales
and
as
king
nentres
of
garloth
while
to
crown
the
varied
disguises
of
this
proteus
of
british
gods
he
appears
in
an
isolated
episode
as
balan
who
fights
with
his
brother
balin
until
they
kill
one
another
one
may
generally
tell
the
divinities
of
the
underworld
in
these
romances
by
their
connection
not
with
the
settled
and
civilized
parts
of
england
but
with
the
wild
and
remote
north
and
west
and
the
still
wilder
and
remoter
islands
just
as
brân
and
urien
are
kings
of
gower
so
arawn
under
the
corruptions
of
his
name
into
and
is
made
king
of
scotland
or
ireland
both
countries
having
been
probably
confounded
as
the
same
land
of
the
scotti
or
gaels
pwyll
head
of
annwn
we
likewise
discover
under
two
disguises
as
pelles
of
the
foreign
and
keeper
of
the
holy
grail
he
is
a
personage
of
great
mythological
significance
albeit
the
real
nature
of
him
and
his
surroundings
has
been
overlaid
with
a
christian
veneer
as
foreign
to
the
original
of
pelles
as
his
own
kingdom
was
to
knights
the
chief
of
hades
figures
as
a
nigh
unto
joseph
of
who
he
might
ride
supported
much
christendom
and
holy
he
is
represented
as
the
father
of
elayne
elen
whom
he
gives
in
marriage
to
sir
launcelot
bestowing
upon
the
couple
a
residence
called
the
name
of
which
there
is
good
evidence
to
show
is
connected
with
that
of
vassal
called
teirnyon
twryf
vliant
in
the
first
of
the
mabinogi
under
his
other
name
of
hero
of
idyll
of
and
primitive
myth
of
pwyll
is
touched
at
a
different
point
after
his
unfortunate
with
ettarre
or
ettard
as
malory
calls
her
pelleas
is
represented
as
marrying
nimue
whose
original
name
which
was
rhiannon
reached
this
form
as
well
as
that
of
through
a
series
of
miscopyings
of
successive
scribes
with
pelles
or
pelleas
is
associated
a
king
pellean
or
pellam
his
son
and
equally
with
him
the
keeper
of
the
grail
who
can
be
no
other
than
pryderi
like
that
deity
in
the
mabinogi
of
mâth
he
is
defeated
by
one
of
the
gods
of
light
the
dealer
of
the
blow
however
is
not
arthur
as
successor
to
gwydion
but
balin
the
belinus
another
dark
deity
gwyn
son
of
nudd
we
discover
under
all
of
his
three
titles
called
variously
and
by
malory
the
welsh
gwynwas
or
gwyn
is
altogether
on
side
the
cornish
melwas
split
into
two
different
knights
divides
his
allegiance
as
sir
melias
or
meleaus
de
lile
the
he
is
a
knight
of
the
round
table
though
on
the
quarrel
between
arthur
and
launcelot
he
sides
with
the
knight
against
the
king
but
as
sir
meliagraunce
or
meliagaunce
it
is
he
who
as
in
the
older
myth
captures
queen
guinevere
and
carries
her
off
to
his
castle
under
his
somerset
name
of
avallon
or
avallach
he
is
connected
with
the
episode
of
the
grail
king
evelake
is
a
saracen
ruler
who
was
converted
by
joseph
of
arimathea
and
brought
by
him
to
britain
in
his
enthusiasm
he
attempted
the
quest
of
the
holy
vessel
but
was
not
allowed
to
succeed
as
a
consolation
however
it
was
divinely
promised
him
that
he
should
not
die
until
he
had
seen
a
knight
of
his
blood
in
the
ninth
degree
who
should
achieve
it
this
was
done
by
sir
percivale
king
evelake
being
then
three
hundred
years
old
turning
from
deities
of
darkness
to
deities
of
light
we
find
the
figuring
largely
in
the
morte
darthur
the
lludd
of
the
earlier
mythology
is
king
loth
or
lot
of
orkney
through
an
intrigue
with
whose
wife
arthur
becomes
the
father
of
sir
mordred
wife
was
the
mother
also
of
sir
gawain
whose
birth
malory
does
not
however
attribute
to
arthur
though
such
must
have
been
the
original
form
of
the
myth
sir
gawain
of
the
arthurian
legend
is
the
gwalchmei
of
the
welsh
stories
the
successor
of
the
still
earlier
lleu
llaw
gyffes
just
as
sir
welsh
to
brother
dylan
as
sir
mordred
retains
the
dark
character
of
medrawt
so
sir
gawain
even
in
malory
shows
the
attributes
of
a
solar
deity
we
are
told
that
his
strength
increased
gradually
from
dawn
till
high
noon
and
then
as
gradually
decreased
piece
of
pagan
symbolism
which
forms
a
good
example
of
the
appositeness
of
sir
edward
figure
for
it
stands
out
of
the
mediæval
narrative
like
an
ancient
brick
in
some
more
modern
building
the
zeus
of
the
later
cycle
emrys
or
myrddin
appears
in
the
morte
darthur
under
both
his
names
the
word
becomes
and
king
bors
of
gaul
is
made
a
brother
of
king
ban
of
benwyck
is
brân
of
the
square
enclosure
the
ubiquitous
underworld
god
myrddin
we
meet
under
no
such
disguise
the
merlin
still
retains
intact
the
attributes
of
the
he
remains
above
and
apart
from
all
the
knights
higher
even
in
some
respects
than
king
arthur
to
whom
he
stands
in
much
the
same
position
as
mâth
does
to
gwydion
in
the
mabinogi
like
mâth
he
is
an
enchanter
and
like
mâth
too
who
could
hear
everything
said
in
the
world
in
however
low
a
tone
if
only
the
wind
met
it
he
is
practically
omniscient
the
account
of
his
final
disappearance
as
told
in
the
morte
darthur
is
only
a
of
the
original
story
the
giving
place
to
what
novelists
call
feminine
everyone
knows
how
the
great
magician
fell
into
a
dotage
upon
the
of
the
whom
malory
calls
and
tennyson
names
being
that
of
in
disguise
would
let
her
have
no
rest
but
always
he
would
be
with
her
and
she
was
ever
passing
weary
of
him
and
fain
would
have
been
delivered
of
him
for
she
was
afeard
of
him
because
he
was
a
son
and
she
could
not
put
him
away
by
no
means
and
so
on
a
time
it
happed
that
merlin
showed
to
her
in
a
rock
whereas
was
a
great
wonder
and
wrought
by
enchantment
that
went
under
a
great
stone
so
by
her
subtle
working
she
made
merlin
to
go
under
that
stone
to
let
her
wit
of
the
marvels
there
but
she
wrought
so
there
for
him
that
he
never
came
out
for
all
the
craft
that
he
could
do
and
so
she
departed
and
left
living
grave
is
still
to
be
seen
at
the
end
of
the
des
in
the
forest
of
brécilien
in
brittany
the
tomb
of
stone
is
certainly
but
a
prosaic
equivalent
for
the
tower
of
woven
air
in
which
the
went
to
his
rest
still
it
is
not
quite
so
unpoetic
as
the
leather
sack
in
which
rhiannon
the

it

time
now
that
the
most

figures

british
mythology
have
been
shown
under
their
knightly
disguises
and
their
place
in
arthurian
legend
indicated
to
pass
on
to
some
account
of
the
real
of
sir
thomas
romance
externally
it
is
the
history
of
an
arthur
king
of
britain
whom
most
people
of
time
considered
as
eminently
a
historical
character
around
this
central
narrative
of
reign
and
deeds
are
grouped
in
the
form
of
episodes
the
personal
exploits
of
the
knights
believed
to
have
supported
him
by
forming
a
kind
of
household
guard
but
with
the
exception
of
a
little
magnified
and
distorted
legendary
history
the
whole
cycle
of
romance
may
be
ultimately
resolved
into
a
few
myths
not
only
retold
but
recombined
in
several
forms
by
their
various
tellers
the
norman
adapters
of
the
de
found
the
british
mythology
already
in
process
of
transformation
some
of
the
gods
having
dwindled
into
human
warriors
and
others
into
hardly
less
human
druids
and
magicians
under
their
hands
the
british
warriors
became
norman
knights
who
did
their
deeds
of
prowess
in
the
and
found
their
inspiration
in
the
fantastic
chivalry
popularized
by
the
trouveres
while
the
druids
put
off
their
still
somewhat
barbaric
druidism
for
the
more
conventional
magic
of
the
latin
races
more
than
this
as
soon
as
the
real
sequence
and
of
the
tales
had
been
lost
sight
of
their
adapters
used
a
free
hand
in
reweaving
them
most
of
the
romancers
had
their
favourite
characters
whom
they
made
the
central
figure
in
their
stories
sir
gawain
sir
percival
sir
tristrem
and
sir
owain
all
of
them
probably
once
local
british
appear
as
the
most
important
personages
of
the
romances
called
after
their
names
stories
of
the
doughty
deeds
of
christened
knights
who
had
little
left
about
them
either
of
briton
or
of
pagan
it
is
only
the
labours
of
the
modern
scholar
that
can
bring
back
to
us
at
this
late
date
things
long
forgotten
when
book
was
issued
from
press
but
oblivion
is
not
annihilation
and
professor
rhys
points
out
to
us
the
old
myths
lying
embedded
in
their
later
setting
with
almost
the
same
certainty
with
which
the
geologist
can
show
us
the
fossils
in
the
rock
thus
treated
they
resolve
themselves
into
three
principal
prominent
everywhere
in
celtic
mythology
the
birth
of
the
the
struggle
between
light
and
darkness
and
the
raiding
of
the
underworld
by
friendly
gods
for
the
good
of
man
the
first
has
been
already
dealt
with
it
is
the
retelling
of
the
story
of
the
origin
of
the
in
the
mabinogi
of
mâth
son
of
mâthonwy
for
gwydion
we
now
have
arthur
instead
of
arianrod
the
wife
of
the
superannuated
nwyvre
we
find
the
wife
of
king
lot
the
superannuated
lludd
lleu
llaw
gyffes
rises
again
as
sir
gawain
gwalchmei
and
dylan
as
sir
mordred
medrawt
while
the
wise
merlin
the
jupiter
of
the
new
system
takes
the
place
of
his
wise
prototype
mâth
connected
with
this
first
myth
is
the
struggle
between
light
and
darkness
of
which
there
are
several
versions
in
the
morte
darthur
the
leading
one
is
the
rebellion
of
the
sir
mordred
against
arthur
and
sir
gawain
while
on
other
stages
dark
god
with
belinus
and
the
same
balin
or
belinus
gives
an
almost
mortal
stroke
to
pellam
the
pryderi
of
the
older
mythology
the
same
myth
has
also
a
wider
form
in
which
the
battle
is
waged
for
possession
of
a
maiden
thus
to
seek
no
other
instances
gwynhwyvar
was
contended
for
by
arthur
and
medrawt
or
in
an
earlier
form
of
the
myth
by
arthur
and
gwyn
in
the
morte
darthur
gwyn
under
the
corruption
of
his
cornish
name
melwas
into
still
captures
guinevere
but
it
is
no
longer
arthur
who
rescues
her
that
task
or
privilege
has
fallen
to
a
new
champion
it
is
sir
launcelot
who
follows
sir
meliagraunce
defeats
and
slays
him
and
rescues
the
fair
captive
but
sir
launcelot
it
must
be
to
the
surprise
of
those
to
whom
the
arthurian
story
without
launcelot
and
queen
guinevere
must
seem
almost
like
the
play
of
with
hamlet
left
unknown
to
the
original
tradition
welsh
song
and
story
are
silent
with
regard
to
him
and
he
is
not
improbably
a
creation
of
some
norman
romancer
who
calmly
appropriated
to
his
credit
deeds
earlier
told
of
other
but
the
romantic
treatment
of
these
two
myths
by
the
adapters
of
the
de
are
of
smaller
interest
to
us
at
the
present
day
than
that
of
the
third
the
attraction
of
the
arthurian
story
lies
less
in
the
battles
of
arthur
or
the
loves
of
guinevere
than
in
the
legend
that
has
given
it
its
lasting
christian
romance
of
the
quest
of
the
holy
grail
so
great
and
various
has
been
the
inspiration
of
this
legend
to
noble
works
both
of
art
and
literature
that
it
seems
almost
a
kind
of
sacrilege
to
trace
it
back
like
all
the
rest
of
story
to
a
paganism
which
could
not
have
even
understood
much
less
created
its
mystical
beauty
none
the
less
is
the
whole
story
directly
evolved
from
primitive
pagan
myths
concerning
a
miraculous
cauldron
of
fertility
and
inspiration
in
the
later
romances
the
holy
grail
is
a
christian
relic
of
marvellous
potency
it
had
held
the
paschal
lamb
eaten
at
the
last
supper
and
after
the
death
of
christ
joseph
of
arimathea
had
filled
it
with
the
blood
but
before
it
received
this
colouring
it
had
been
the
magic
cauldron
of
all
the
celtic
which
fed
all
who
came
to
it
and
from
which
none
went
away
unsatisfied
cauldron
of
renovation
which
brought
the
dead
back
to
life
the
cauldron
of
ogyrvran
the
giant
from
which
the
muses
ascended
the
cauldrons
captured
by
cuchulainn
from
the
king
of
the
shadowy
city
and
by
arthur
from
the
chief
of
hades
as
well
as
several
other
mythic
vessels
of
less
note
in
its
transition
from
pagan
to
christian
form
hardly
one
of
the
features
of
the
ancient
myth
has
been
really
obscured
we
may
recount
the
chief
attributes
as
taliesin
tells
them
in
his
of
of
the
cauldron
captured
by
arthur
it
was
the
property
of
pwyll
and
of
his
son
pryderi
who
lived
in
a
kingdom
of
the
other
world
called
among
other
titles
the
the
the
of
the
the
and
the
of
this
place
was
surrounded
by
the
sea
and
in
other
ways
made
difficult
of
access
there
was
no
lack
of
wine
there
and
its
happy
inhabitants
spent
with
music
and
feasting
an
existence
which
neither
disease
nor
old
age
could
assail
as
for
the
cauldron
it
had
a
rim
of
pearls
around
its
edge
the
fire
beneath
it
was
kept
fanned
by
the
breaths
of
nine
maidens
it
spoke
doubtless
in
words
of
prophetic
wisdom
and
it
would
not
cook
the
food
of
a
perjurer
or
coward
here
we
have
considerable
data
on
which
to
base
a
parallel
between
the
pagan
cauldron
and
the
christian
grail
nor
have
we
far
to
go
in
search
of
correspondences
for
they
are
nearly
all
preserved
in
romance
the
mystic
vessel
was
kept
by
king
pelles
who
is
pwyll
in
a
castle
called
a
name
which
resolves
itself
in
the
hands
of
the
philologist
into
the
or
other
words
the
of
poem
of
the
character
of
the
place
as
a
of
and
a
of
where
wine
was
the
drink
of
the
we
have
more
than
a
hint
in
the
account
twice
given
of
how
upon
the
appearance
of
the
it
should
be
noticed
by
a
maiden
or
hall
was
filled
with
good
odours
and
every
knight
found
on
the
table
all
the
kinds
of
meat
and
drink
he
could
imagine
as
most
desirable
it
could
not
be
seen
by
sinners
a
christian
refinement
of
the
savage
idea
of
a
pot
that
would
not
cook
a
food
but
the
sight
of
it
alone
would
cure
of
wounds
and
sickness
those
who
approached
it
faithfully
and
humbly
and
in
its
presence
neither
old
age
nor
sickness
could
oppress
them
and
though
in
malory
we
find
no
reference
either
to
the
spot
having
been
surrounded
by
water
or
to
the
castle
as
a
one
we
have
only
to
turn
from
the
morte
darthur
to
the
romance
entitled
the
to
discover
both
gwalchmei
going
to
the
castle
of
king
peleur
pryderi
finds
it
encircled
by
a
great
water
while
peredur
approaching
the
same
place
sees
it
turning
with
greater
speed
than
the
swiftest
wind
moreover
archers
on
the
walls
shoot
so
vigorously
that
no
armour
can
resist
their
shafts
which
explains
how
it
happened
that
of
those
that
went
with
arthur
seven
none
returned
from
caer
it
is
noticeable
that
arthur
himself
never
attempts
the
quest
of
the
grail
though
it
was
he
who
had
achieved
its
pagan
original
we
find
in
malory
four
competitors
for
the
mantle
of
pelleas
sir
bors
sir
percivale
and
sir
galahad
the
first
of
these
may
be
put
out
of
court
at
once
sir
pelleas
who
being
himself
pelles
or
pwyll
the
keeper
of
it
could
have
had
no
reason
for
such
exertions
at
the
second
we
may
look
doubtfully
for
sir
bors
is
no
other
than
emrys
or
myrddin
and
casting
back
to
the
earlier
british
mythology
we
do
not
find
the
personally
active
in
securing
boons
by
force
or
craft
from
the
underworld
the
other
two
have
better
percivale
and
sir
galahad
is
the
name
for
peredur
the
hero
of
a
story
in
the
red
book
of
hergest
which
gives
the
oldest
form
of
a
grail
quest
we
have
it
is
anterior
to
the
norman
romances
and
forms
almost
a
between
tales
of
mythology
and
of
chivalry
peredur
or
sir
percivale
therefore
is
the
oldest
most
primitive
of
grail
seekers
on
the
other
hand
sir
galahad
is
the
latest
and
youngest
but
there
is
reason
to
believe
that
galahad
in
welsh
the
of
is
the
same
solar
hero
as
gawain
in
welsh
the
of
both
are
made
in
the
story
of
and
sons
of
the
same
mother
gwyar
sir
gawain
himself
is
in
one
arthurian
romance
the
achiever
of
the
grail
it
is
needless
to
attempt
to
choose
between
these
two
both
have
the
attributes
of
gwalchmei
the
successor
of
lleu
llaw
gyffes
and
peredur
paladrhir
that
is
to
say
the
with
the
long
may
be
allowed
to
claim
equal
honours
what
is
important
is
that
the
quest
of
the
grail
once
the
chief
treasure
of
hades
is
still
accomplished
by
one
who
takes
in
later
legend
the
place
of
lieu
llaw
gyffes
and
lugh
lamhfada
in
the

the
mother
of
the
heaven
gods
seems
strangely
described
as
a
of
lochlin
and
dublin
who
led
the
irish
into
north
wales
in
more
recognizable
is
son
gwydion
who
introduced
the
knowledge
of
letters
into
the
country
of
his
adoption
the
dynasty
of
dôn
according
to
a
manuscript
in
the
collection
of
edward
known
under
his
bardic
name
of
iolo
north
wales
for
a
hundred
and
years
when
the
north
british
king
cunedda
invaded
the
country
defeated
the
irish
in
a
great
battle
and
drove
them
across
sea
to
the
isle
of
man
this
battle
is
historical
and
putting
dôn
and
gwydion
out
of
the
question
probably
represented
the
last
stand
of
the
gael
in
the
extreme
west
of
britain
against
the
second
and
stronger
wave
of
celtic
invasion
in
the
same
collection
of
is
found
a
curious
and
even
comic
euhemeristic
version
of
the
strange
myth
of
the
bone
prison
of
oeth
and
anoeth
which
manawyddan
son
of
llyr
built
in
gower
the
new
reading
makes
that
ghastly
abode
a
real
building
constructed
out
of
the
bones
of
the
romans
killed
in
battle
with
the
cymri
it
consisted
of
numerous
chambers
some
of
large
bones
and
some
of
small
some
above
ground
and
some
under
prisoners
of
war
were
placed
in
the
more
comfortable
cells
the
underground
dungeons
being
kept
for
traitors
to
their
country
several
times
the
demolished
the
prison
but
each
time
the
cymri
rebuilt
it
stronger
than
before
at
last
however
the
bones
decayed
and
being
spread
upon
the
ground
made
an
excellent
manure
that
time
the
people
of
the
neighbourhood
astonishing
crops
of
wheat
and
barley
and
of
every
other
grain
for
many
it
is
not
however
in
these
so
to
speak
unauthorized
narratives
that
we
can
best
refind
our
british
deities
but
in
the
compact
coherent
and
at
times
almost
convincing
of
geoffrey
of
monmouth
published
in
the
first
half
of
the
twelfth
century
and
for
hundreds
of
years
gravely
quoted
as
the
leading
authority
on
the
early
history
of
our
islands
the
modern
critical
spirit
has
of
course
relegated
it
to
the
region
of
fable
we
can
no
longer
accept
the
pleasant
tradition
of
the
descent
of
the
britons
from
the
survivors
of
troy
led
westward
in
search
of
a
new
home
by
brutus
the
of
the
pious
æneas
nor
indeed
does
any
portion
of
the
from
æneas
to
athelstan
quite
persuade
the
reader
its
kings
succeed
one
another
in
plausible
sequence
but
they
themselves
are
too
obviously
the
heroes
of
popular
legend
a
large
part
of
books
out
of
of
course
devoted
to
arthur
in
it
he
tells
the
story
of
that
conquests
not
only
in
his
own
country
against
the
saxons
the
irish
the
scots
and
the
picts
but
over
all
western
europe
we
see
the
british
champion
after
annexing
ireland
iceland
gothland
and
the
orkneys
following
up
these
minor
victories
by
subduing
norway
dacia
by
which
denmark
seems
to
have
been
meant
aquitaine
and
gaul
after
such
triumphs
there
was
clearly
nothing
left
for
him
but
the
overthrow
of
the
roman
empire
and
this
he
had
practically
achieved
when
the
rebellion
of
mordred
brought
him
home
to
his
death
or
rather
for
even
geoffrey
does
not
quite
lose
hold
of
the
belief
in
the
undying
arthur
to
be
carried
to
the
island
of
avallon
to
be
healed
of
his
wounds
the
crown
of
britain
falling
to
kinsman
constantine
the
son
of
cador
duke
of
cornwall
in
the
five
hundred
and
year
of
our
upon
the
more
personal
incidents
connected
with
arthur
geoffrey
openly
professes
to
keep
silence
possibly
regarding
them
as
not
falling
within
the
province
of
his
history
but
we
are
told
shortly
how
mordred
took
advantage
of
absence
on
the
continent
to
seize
the
throne
marry
guanhamara
guinevere
and
ally
himself
with
the
saxons
only
to
be
defeated
at
that
fatal
battle
called
by
geoffrey
in
which
mordred
arthur
and
of
malory
and
the
gwalchmei
of
the
earlier
met
their
dooms
we
find
the
gods
of
the
older
generation
standing
in
the
same
position
with
regard
to
arthur
in
as
they
do
in
the
later
welsh
triads
and
tales
though
rulers
they
are
yet
his
vassals
in
brothers
of
royal
called
lot
urian
and
augusel
who
are
represented
as
having
been
chiefs
in
the
north
we
may
discern
lludd
urien
and
arawn
to
these
three
arthur
restored
rights
of
their
handing
over
the
of
scotland
to
augusel
giving
urian
the
government
of
murief
moray
and
lot
the
consulship
of
loudonesia
lothian
and
the
other
provinces
belonging
to
two
other
rulers
subject
to
him
are
gunvasius
king
of
the
orkneys
and
malvasius
king
of
iceland
in
whom
we
recognize
gwyn
under
latinized
forms
of
his
welsh
name
gwynwas
and
his
cornish
name
melwas
but
it
is
characteristic
of
geoffrey
of
loose
hold
upon
his
materials
that
not
content
with
having
connected
several
of
these
gods
with
period
he
further
endows
them
with
reigns
of
their
own
was
vassal
but
was
himself
king
of
britain
centuries
before
arthur
was
born
lud
that
is
lludd
succeeded
his
father
beli
we
hear
nothing
of
his
silver
hand
but
we
learn
that
he
was
for
the
building
of
cities
and
for
rebuilding
the
walls
of
trinovantum
which
he
also
surrounded
with
innumerable
towers
and
though
he
had
many
other
cities
yet
he
loved
this
above
them
all
and
resided
in
it
the
greater
part
of
the
year
for
which
reason
it
was
afterwards
called
kaerlud
and
by
the
corruption
of
the
word
caerlondon
and
again
by
change
of
languages
in
process
of
time
london
as
also
by
foreigners
who
arrived
here
and
reduced
this
country
under
their
subjection
it
was
called
londres
at
last
when
he
was
dead
his
body
was
buried
by
the
gate
which
to
this
time
is
called
in
the
british
tongue
after
his
name
parthlud
and
in
the
saxon
he
was
succeeded
by
his
brother
cassibellawn
cassivelaunus
during
whose
reign
julius
caesar
first
invaded
britain
lludd
however
is
not
entirely
dependent
upon
geoffrey
of
monmouth
for
his
reputation
as
a
king
of
britain
one
of
the
old
welsh
romances
translated
by
lady
charlotte
guest
in
her
mabinogion
relates
the
rebuilding
of
london
by
lludd
in
almost
the
same
words
as
geoffrey
the
story
which
these
details
introduce
is
however
an
obviously
mythological
one
it
tells
us
how
in
the
days
of
lludd
britain
was
oppressed
by
three
plagues
the
first
was
the
arrival
of
a
strange
race
of
sorcerers
called
the
who
had
three
qualities
which
made
them
unpopular
they
paid
their
way
in
which
though
apparently
real
returned
the
shields
horses
and
hounds
made
by
gwydion
son
of
dôn
to
deceive
the
fungus
out
of
which
it
had
been
charmed
by
magic
they
could
hear
everything
that
was
said
over
the
whole
of
britain
in
however
low
a
tone
provided
only
that
the
wind
met
it
and
they
could
not
be
injured
by
any
weapon
the
second
was
shriek
that
came
on
every
may
eve
over
every
hearth
in
the
island
of
britain
and
went
through
hearts
and
so
scared
them
that
the
men
lost
their
hue
and
their
strength
and
the
women
their
children
and
the
young
men
and
the
maidens
their
senses
and
all
the
animals
and
trees
and
the
earth
and
the
waters
were
left
the
third
was
a
disappearance
of
the
food
hoarded
in
the
palace
which
was
so
complete
that
a
provisions
vanished
in
a
single
night
and
so
mysterious
that
no
one
could
ever
find
out
its
cause
by
the
advice
of
his
nobles
lludd
went
to
france
to
obtain
the
help
of
its
king
his
brother
llevelys
who
was
man
great
of
counsel
and
in
order
to
be
able
to
consult
with
his
brother
without
being
overheard
by
the
coranians
llevelys
caused
a
long
tube
of
brass
to
be
made
through
which
they
talked
to
one
another
the
sorcerer
tribe
however
got
to
know
of
it
and
though
they
could
not
hear
what
was
being
said
inside
the
they
sent
a
demon
into
it
who
whispered
insulting
messages
up
and
down
it
as
though
from
one
brother
to
the
other
but
lludd
and
llevelys
knew
one
another
too
well
to
be
deceived
by
this
and
they
drove
the
demon
out
of
the
tube
by
flooding
it
with
wine
then
llevelys
told
lludd
to
take
certain
insects
which
he
would
give
him
and
pound
them
in
water
when
the
water
was
sufficiently
permeated
with
their
essence
he
was
to
call
both
his
own
people
and
the
coranians
together
as
though
for
a
conference
and
in
the
midst
of
the
meeting
to
cast
it
over
all
of
them
alike
the
water
though
harmless
to
his
own
people
would
nevertheless
prove
a
deadly
poison
to
the
coranians
as
for
the
shriek
llevelys
explained
it
to
be
raised
by
a
dragon
this
monster
was
the
red
dragon
of
britain
and
it
raised
the
shriek
because
it
was
being
attacked
by
the
white
dragon
of
the
saxons
which
was
trying
to
overcome
and
destroy
it
the
french
king
told
his
brother
to
measure
the
length
and
breadth
of
britain
and
when
he
had
found
the
exact
centre
of
the
island
to
cause
a
pit
to
be
dug
there
in
this
pit
was
to
be
placed
a
vessel
containing
the
best
mead
that
could
be
made
with
a
covering
of
satin
over
it
to
hide
it
lludd
was
then
to
watch
from
some
safe
place
the
dragons
would
appear
and
fight
in
the
air
until
they
were
exhausted
then
they
would
fall
together
on
to
the
top
of
the
satin
cloth
and
so
draw
it
down
with
them
into
the
vessel
full
of
mead
naturally
they
would
drink
the
mead
and
equally
naturally
they
would
then
sleep
as
soon
as
lludd
was
sure
that
they
were
helpless
he
was
to
go
to
the
pit
wrap
the
satin
cloth
round
both
of
them
and
bury
them
together
in
a
stone
coffin
in
the
strongest
place
in
britain
if
this
were
safely
done
there
would
be
no
more
heard
of
the
shriek
and
the
disappearance
of
the
food
was
caused
by
mighty
man
of
who
put
everyone
to
sleep
by
charms
before
he
removed
the
provisions
lludd
was
to
watch
for
him
sitting
by
the
side
of
a
cauldron
full
of
cold
water
as
often
as
he
felt
the
approach
of
drowsiness
he
was
to
plunge
into
the
cauldron
thus
he
would
be
able
to
keep
awake
and
frustrate
the
thief
so
lludd
came
back
to
britain
he
pounded
the
insects
in
the
water
and
then
summoned
both
the
men
of
britain
and
the
coranians
to
a
meeting
in
the
midst
of
it
he
sprinkled
the
water
over
everyone
alike
the
natives
took
no
harm
from
this
mythological
but
the
coranians
died
lludd
was
then
ready
to
deal
with
the
dragons
his
careful
measurements
proved
that
the
centre
of
the
island
of
britain
was
at
oxford
and
there
he
caused
the
pit
to
be
dug
with
the
vessel
of
mead
in
it
hidden
by
the
satin
covering
having
made
everything
ready
he
watched
and
soon
saw
the
dragons
appear
for
a
long
time
they
fought
desperately
in
the
air
then
they
fell
down
together
on
to
the
satin
cloth
and
drawing
it
after
them
subsided
into
the
mead
lludd
waited
till
they
were
quite
silent
and
then
pulled
them
out
folded
them
carefully
in
the
wrapping
and
took
them
to
the
district
of
snowdon
where
he
buried
them
in
the
strong
fortress
whose
remains
near
beddgelert
are
still
called
after
this
the
terrible
shriek
was
not
heard
again
until
merlin
had
them
dug
up
five
hundred
years
later
when
they
recommenced
fighting
and
the
red
dragon
drove
the
white
one
out
of
britain
last
of
all
lludd
prepared
a
great
banquet
in
his
hall
and
watched
over
it
armed
with
the
cauldron
of
water
near
him
in
the
middle
of
the
night
he
heard
soft
drowsy
music
such
as
nearly
put
him
to
sleep
but
he
kept
awake
by
repeatedly
dipping
himself
in
the
cold
water
just
before
dawn
a
huge
man
clad
in
armour
came
into
the
hall
carrying
a
basket
which
he
began
to
load
with
the
viands
on
the
table
like
the
bag
in
which
pwyll
captured
gwawl
its
holding
capacity
seemed
endless
however
the
man
filled
it
at
last
and
was
carrying
it
out
when
lludd
stopped
him
they
fought
and
lludd
conquered
the
man
of
magic
and
made
him
his
vassal
thus
the
plagues
of
came
to
an
end
lludd
in
changing
from
god
to
king
seems
to
have
lost
most
of
his
old
mythological
attributes
even
his
daughter
creudylad
is
taken
from
him
and
given
to
another
of
the
ancient
british
deities
why
lludd
the
should
have
been
confounded
with
llyr
the
is
not
very
apparent
but
it
is
certain
that
of
the
early
welsh
legends
and
poems
is
the
same
as
and
the
great
dramatist
was
ultimately
indebted
to
the
celtic
mythology
for
the
groundwork
of
the
legend
which
he
wove
into
the
tragic
story
of
as
geoffrey
calls
him
was
the
son
of
bladud
who
built
caer
badus
bath
and
perished
like
icarus
as
the
result
of
an
accident
with
a
of
his
own
invention
having
no
sons
but
three
daughters
gonorilla
regan
and
cordeilla
he
thought
in
his
old
age
of
dividing
his
kingdom
among
them
but
first
of
all
he
decided
to
make
trial
of
their
affection
for
him
with
the
idea
of
giving
the
best
portions
of
his
realm
to
the
most
worthy
gonorilla
the
eldest
replied
to
his
question
of
how
much
she
loved
him
she
called
heaven
to
witness
she
loved
him
more
than
her
own
regan
answered
an
oath
she
could
not
otherwise
express
her
thoughts
but
that
she
loved
him
above
all
but
when
it
came
to
turn
the
youngest
daughter
disgusted
with
her
hypocrisy
spoke
after
a
quite
different
fashion
father
said
she
there
any
daughter
that
can
love
her
father
more
than
duty
requires
in
my
opinion
whoever
pretends
to
it
must
disguise
her
real
sentiments
under
the
veil
of
flattery
i
have
always
loved
you
as
a
father
nor
do
i
yet
depart
from
my
purposed
duty
and
if
you
insist
to
have
something
more
extorted
from
me
hear
now
the
greatness
of
my
affection
which
i
always
bear
you
and
take
this
for
a
short
answer
to
all
your
questions
look
how
much
you
have
so
much
is
your
value
and
so
much
do
i
love
her
enraged
father
immediately
bestowed
his
kingdom
upon
his
two
other
daughters
marrying
them
to
the
two
highest
of
his
nobility
gonorilla
to
maglaunus
duke
of
albania
and
regan
to
henuinus
duke
of
cornwall
to
cordeilla
he
not
only
refused
a
share
in
his
realm
but
even
a
dowry
aganippus
king
of
the
franks
married
her
however
for
her
beauty
alone
once
in
possession
two
rebelled
against
him
and
deprived
him
of
all
regal
authority
the
sole
recompense
for
his
lost
power
was
an
agreement
by
maglaunus
to
allow
him
maintenance
with
a
of
sixty
soldiers
but
after
two
years
the
duke
of
albania
at
his
wife
instigation
reduced
them
to
thirty
resenting
this
leir
left
maglaunus
and
went
to
henuinus
the
husband
of
regan
the
duke
of
cornwall
at
first
received
him
honourably
but
before
a
year
was
out
compelled
him
to
discharge
all
his
attendants
except
five
this
sent
him
back
in
a
rage
to
his
eldest
daughter
who
this
time
swore
that
he
should
not
stay
with
her
unless
he
would
be
satisfied
with
one
only
in
despair
leir
resolved
to
throw
himself
upon
the
mercy
of
cordeilla
and
full
of
contrition
for
the
way
he
had
treated
her
and
of
misgivings
as
to
how
he
might
be
received
took
ship
for

soon
as
he
was

all
the

used
to
begin

exactly
what
myth
is
retold
in
this
history
of
leir
and
his
three
daughters
we
are
hardly
likely
ever
to
discover
but
its
mythological
nature
is
clear
enough
in
the
light
of
the
description
of
the
underground
temple
dedicated
to
llyr
at
once
the
god
of
the
subaqueous
and
therefore
subterranean
world
and
a
british
dis
pater
connected
with
the
origin
of
things
like
the
roman
god
janus
with
whom
he
was
apparently
identified
ten
kings
or
so
after
this
for
any
more
exact
way
of
measuring
the
flight
of
time

absent
from
we
recognize
two
other
british
gods
upon
the
scene
brennius
that
is
brân
disputes
the
kingdom
with
his
brother
belinus
clearly
this
is
a
version
of
the
ancient
myth
of
the
twin
brothers
darkness
and
light
which
we
have
seen
expressed
in
so
many
ways
in
celtic
mythology
brân
the
god
of
death
and
the
underworld
is
opposed
to
belinus
god
of
the
sun
and
health
in
the
original
lost
myth
probably
they
alternately
conquered
and
were
symbol
of
the
alternation
of
night
and
day
and
of
winter
and
summer
in
they
divided
britain
belinus
taking
crown
of
the
island
with
the
dominions
of
loegria
kambria
and
cornwall
because
according
to
the
trojan
constitution
the
right
of
inheritance
would
come
to
him
as
the
while
brennius
as
the
younger
had
which
extended
from
the
river
humber
to
but
flatterers
persuaded
brennius
to
ally
himself
with
the
king
of
the
norwegians
and
attack
belinus
a
battle
was
fought
in
which
belinus
was
conqueror
and
brennius
escaped
to
gaul
where
he
married
the
daughter
of
the
duke
of
the
allobroges
and
on
that
death
was
declared
successor
to
the
throne
thus
firmly
established
with
an
army
he
invaded
britain
again
belinus
marched
with
the
whole
strength
of
the
kingdom
to
meet
him
and
the
armies
were
already
drawn
out
opposite
to
one
another
in
battle
array
when
conwenna
the
mother
of
the
two
kings
succeeded
in
reconciling
them
not
having
one
another
to
fight
with
the
brothers
now
agreed
upon
a
joint
expedition
with
their
armies
into
gaul
the
britons
and
the
allobroges
conquered
all
the
other
kings
of
the
franks
and
then
entered
italy
destroying
villages
and
cities
as
they
marched
to
rome
gabius
and
porsena
the
roman
consuls
bought
them
off
with
large
presents
of
gold
and
silver
and
the
promise
of
a
yearly
tribute
whereupon
brennius
and
belinus
withdrew
their
army
into
germany
and
began
to
devastate
it
but
the
romans
now
no
longer
taken
by
surprise
and
unprepared
came
to
the
help
of
the
germans
this
brought
brennius
and
belinus
back
to
rome
which
after
a
long
siege
they
succeeded
in
taking
brennius
remained
in
italy
he
exercised
tyranny
over
the
and
one
may
take
the
whole
of
this
veracious
history
to
be
due
to
a
patriotic
desire
to
make
out
the
brennus
of
actually
did
sack
rome
in
briton
belinus
the
other
brother
returned
to
england
made
a
gate
of
wonderful
structure
in
trinovantum
upon
the
bank
of
the
thames
which
the
citizens
call
after
his
name
billingsgate
to
this
day
over
it
he
built
a
prodigiously
large
tower
and
under
it
a
haven
or
quay
for
ships
at
last
when
he
had
finished
his
days
his
body
was
burned
and
the
ashes
put
up
in
a
golden
urn
which
they
placed
at
trinovantum
with
wonderful
art
on
the
top
of
the
tower
above
he
was
succeeded
by
gurgiunt
brabtruc
who
as
he
was
returning
by
way
of
the
orkneys
from
a
raid
on
the
danes
met
the
ships
of
partholon
and
his
people
as
they
came
from
spain
to
settle
in
ireland
llyr
and
his
children
large
as
they
bulk
in
mythical
history
were
hardly
less
illustrious
as
saints
the
family
of
llyr
llediath
is
always
described
by
the
early
welsh
hagiologists
as
the
first
of
the
chief
holy
families
of
the
isle
of
the
glory
of
llyr
himself
however
is
but
a
reflected
one
for
it
was
his
son
brân
who
actually
introduced
christianity
into
britain
legend
tells
us
that
he
was
taken
captive
to
rome
with
his
son
caradawc
who
was
identified
for
the
purpose
with
the
historical
caratacus
and
the
rest
of
his
family
and
remained
there
seven
years
during
which
time
he
became
converted
to
the
gospel
and
spread
it
enthusiastically
on
his
return
neither
his
son
caradawc
nor
his
manawyddan
exactly
followed
in
his
footsteps
but
their
descendants
did
sons
were
all
saintly
while
his
daughter
eigen
who
married
a
chief
called
sarrlog
lord
of
caer
sarrlog
old
sarum
was
the
first
female
saint
in
britain
side
of
the
family
was
less
adaptable
his
son
and
his
grandson
were
both
pagans
but
his
obtained
christian
fame
as
dyfan
who
was
sent
as
a
bishop
to
wales
by
pope
eleutherius
and
was
martyred
at
merthyr
dyvan
after
this
the
saintly
line
of
llyr
increases
and
flourishes
singularly
inappropriate
persons
are
found
in
the
apollo
as
well
as
geraint
and
others
of
king
court
it
is
so
quaint
a
conceit
that
christianity
should
have
been
like
all
other
things
the
gift
of
the
celtic
hades
that
it
seems
almost
a
pity
to
cast
doubt
on
it
the
witness
of
the
classical
historians
sums
up
however
dead
in
its
disfavour
tacitus
carefully
enumerates
the
family
of
caratacus
and
describes
how
he
and
his
wife
daughter
and
brother
were
separately
interviewed
by
the
emperor
claudius
but
makes
no
mention
at
all
of
the
supposed
father
brân
moreover
dio
cassius
gives
the
name
of
father
as
he
adds
had
died
before
the
romans
first
invaded
britain
the
evidence
is
wholly
against
brân
as
a
christian
pioneer
he
remains
the
grim
old
god
of
war
and
death
only
to
his
pagan
votaries
and
especially
to
the
bards
who
probably
first
called
him
and
whose
stubborn
adherence
must
have
been
the
cause
of
the
not
less
stubborn
efforts
of
their
enemies
the
christian
clerics
to
bring
him
over
to
their
own
side
by
canonization
they
had
an
easier
task
with
sister
branwen
of
the
goddesses
indeed
seem
to
have
stood
the
process
better
than
brigit
the
of
the
the
british
aphrodité
became
under
the
name
of
brynwyn
or
dwynwen
a
patron
saint
of
lovers
as
late
as
the
fourteenth
century
her
shrine
at
llandwynwyn
in
anglesey
was
the
favourite
resort
of
the
disappointed
of
both
sexes
who
came
to
pray
to
her
image
for
either
success
or
forgetfulness
to
make
the
result
the
more
certain
the
monks
of
the
church
sold
lethean
draughts
from
her
sacred
well
the
legend
told
of
her
is
that
having
vowed
herself
to
perpetual
celibacy
she
fell
in
love
with
a
young
chief
called
maelon
one
night
as
she
was
praying
for
guidance
in
her
difficulty
she
had
a
vision
in
which
she
was
offered
a
goblet
of
delicious
liquor
as
a
draught
of
oblivion
and
she
also
saw
the
same
sweet
medicine
given
to
maelon
whom
it
at
once
froze
into
a
block
of
ice
she
was
then
for
her
faith
offered
the
granting
of
three
boons
the
first
she
chose
was
that
maelon
might
be
allowed
to
resume
his
natural
form
and
temperature
the
second
that
she
should
no
longer
desire
to
be
married
and
the
third
that
her
intercessions
might
be
granted
for
all
lovers
so
that
they
should
either
wed
the
objects
of
their
affection
or
be
cured
of
their
passion
from
this
cause
came
the
virtues
of
her
shrine
and
fountain
but
the
modern
generation
no
longer
flocks
there
and
the
efficacious
well
is
choked
with
sand
none
the
less
she
whom
the
welsh
bards
called
the
of
still
has
her
occasional
votaries
country
girls
of
the
neighbourhood
seek
her
help
when
all
else
fails
the
water
nearest
to
the
church
is
thought
to
be
the
best
substitute
for
the
now
dry
and
ruined
original
well
a
striking
contrast
to
this
easy
victory
over
paganism
is
the
stubborn
resistance
to
christian
adoption
of
gwyn
son
of
nudd
it
is
true
that
he
was
once
enrolled
by
some
monk
in
the
train
of
the
but
it
was
done
in
so
a
way
that
even
now
one
can
discern
that
the
writer
felt
almost
ashamed
of
himself
his
fame
as
at
least
a
powerful
fairy
was
too
vital
to
be
thus
tampered
with
even
spenser
though
in
his
he
calls
him
good
sir
guyon
in
whom
great
rule
of
goodly
doth
does
not
attempt
to
conceal
his
real
nature
it
is
no
man
but
elfin
born
of
noble
state
and
mickle
worship
in
his
native
who
sets
forth
the
beauties
of
that
virtue
for
which
the
original
celtic
paradise
with
its
unfailing
ale
and
rivers
of
mead
and
wine
would
hardly
seem
to
have
been
the
best
possible
school
save
for
spenser
all
authorities
agree
in
making
gwyn
the
determined
opponent
of
things
christian
a
curious
and
picturesque
legend
is
told
of
him
in
connection
with
collen
who
was
himself
the
of
son
caradawc
the
saint
desirous
of
still
further
retirement
from
the
world
had
made
himself
a
cell
beneath
a
rock
near
glastonbury
tor
in
own
of
it
was
close
to
a
road
and
one
day
he
heard
two
men
pass
by
talking
about
gwyn
son
of
nudd
and
declaring
him
to
be
king
of
annwn
and
the
fairies
collen
put
his
head
out
of
the
cell
and
told
them
to
hold
their
tongues
and
that
gwyn
and
his
fairies
were
only
demons
the
two
men
retorted
by
warning
the
saint
that
he
would
soon
have
to
meet
the
dark
ruler
face
to
face
they
passed
on
and
not
long
afterwards
collen
heard
someone
knocking
at
his
door
on
asking
who
was
there
he
got
the
answer
am
here
the
messenger
of
gwyn
ap
nudd
king
of
hades
to
bid
thee
come
by
the
middle
of
the
day
to
speak
with
him
on
the
top
of
the
the
saint
did
not
go
and
the
messenger
came
a
second
time
with
the
same
message
on
the
third
visit
he
added
a
threat
that
if
collen
did
not
come
now
it
would
be
the
worse
for
him
so
a
little
disquieted
he
went
but
not
unarmed
he
consecrated
some
water
and
took
it
with
him
on
other
days
the
top
of
glastonbury
tor
had
always
been
bare
but
on
this
occasion
the
saint
found
it
crowned
by
a
splendid
castle
men
and
maidens
beautifully
dressed
were
going
in
and
out
a
page
received
him
and
told
him
that
the
king
was
waiting
for
him
to
be
his
guest
at
dinner
collen
found
gwyn
sitting
on
a
golden
chair
in
front
of
a
table
covered
with
the
rarest
dainties
and
wines
he
invited
him
to
share
them
adding
that
if
there
was
anything
he
especially
liked
it
should
be
brought
to
him
with
all
honour
do
not
eat
the
leaves
of
trees
replied
the
saint
who
knew
what
fairy
meats
and
drinks
were
made
of
not
taken
aback
by
this
discourteous
answer
the
king
of
annwn
genially
asked
the
saint
if
he
did
not
admire
his
livery
which
was
a
motley
costume
red
on
one
side
and
blue
on
the
other
dress
is
good
enough
for
its
kind
said
collen
kind
is
that
asked
gwyn
red
shows
which
side
is
being
scorched
and
the
blue
shows
which
side
is
being
frozen
replied
the
saint
and
splashing
his
holy
water
all
round
him
he
saw
castle
and
king
vanish
leaving
him
alone
on
the
bare
windy
gwyn
last
of
the
gods
of
annwn
has
evidently
by
this
time
taken
over
the
functions
of
all
the
others
he
has
the
hounds
which
arawn
once
of
with
the
white
bodies
and
the
red
ears
we
hear
more
of
them
in
folklore
than
we
do
of
their
master
though
even
their
tradition
is
dying
out
with
the
spread
of
newspapers
and
railways
we
are
not
likely
to
find
another
reverend
edmund
jones
to
insist
upon
belief
in
them
lest
by
closing
our
minds
to
such
manifest
witnesses
of
the
supernatural
world
we
should
become
infidels
still
we
may
even
now
find
peasants
ready
to
swear
that
they
have
heard
them
sweeping
along
the
upon
stormy
nights
as
they
pursued
the
flying
souls
of
unshriven
men
or
unbaptized
babes
the
tales
told
of
them
agree
curiously
their
cry
is
like
that
of
a
pack
of
foxhounds
but
softer
in
tone
the
nearer
they
are
to
a
man
the
less
loud
their
voices
seem
and
the
farther
off
they
are
the
louder
but
they
are
less
often
seen
than
heard
and
it
has
been
suggested
that
the
sounds
were
the
cries
of
migrating
which
are
not
unlike
those
of
hounds
in
chase
the
superstition
is
widely
spread
the
of
wales
are
called
in
north
devon
the
heath
or
heathen
or
hounds
and
on
dartmoor
the
hounds
in
durham
and
yorkshire
they
are
called
hounds
and
they
are
known
by
various
names
in
norfolk
gloucestershire
and
cornwall
in
scotland
it
is
arthur
who
leads
the
wild
hunt
and
the
tradition
is
found
over
almost
the
whole
of
western
europe
not
many
have
been
preserved
in
which
gwyn
is
mentioned
by
name
his
memory
has
lingered
longest
and
latest
in
the
vale
of
neath
so
close
to
his
the
tawë
abode
not
the
nearest
tawë
but
that
tawë
which
is
the
but
it
may
be
understood
whenever
the
king
of
the
fairies
is
mentioned
as
the
last
of
the
greater
gods
of
the
old
mythology
he
has
been
endowed
by
popular
fancy
with
the
rule
of
all
the
varied
fairy
population
of
britain
so
far
at
least
as
it
is
of
celtic
or
origin
for
some
of
the
fairies
most
famous
in
english
literature
are
teutonic
king
oberon
derives
his
name
through
the
french
from
elberich
the
dwarf
king
of

though
his
queen
titania
was
probably
named
out
of

another

is
merely
the
personification
of
his
race
the
of
wales
of
ireland
of
worcestershire
and
of
the
west
of
england
it
is
wales
that
at
the
present
time
preserves
the
most
numerous
and
diverse
collection
of
fairies
some
of
them
are
beautiful
some
hideous
some
kindly
some
malevolent
there
are
the
gentle
damsels
of
the
lakes
and
streams
called
gwragedd
annwn
and
the
fierce
and
cruel
mountain
fairies
known
as
the
gwyllion
there
are
the
household
sprites
called
bwbachod
like
the
scotch
and
english
the
coblynau
or
gnomes
of
the
mines
called
in
cornwall
and
the
ellyllon
or
elves
of
whom
the
pwccas
are
a
branch
in
the
north
of
england
the
spirits
belong
more
wholly
to
the
lower
type
the
bogles
brownies
killmoulis
redcaps
and
their
like
seem
little
akin
to
the
higher
fairies
the
welsh
bwbach
too
is
described
as
brown
and
hairy
and
the
coblynau
as
black
or
we
shall
hardly
do
wrong
in
regarding
such
spectres
as
the
degraded
gods
of
a
race
like
the
irish
leprechauns
and
pookas
who
have
nothing
in
common
with
the
still
beautiful
still
noble
figures
of
the
tuatha

numberless
and
nameless
subjects

place
of
the
gaelic

in
avilion
a
mysterious
western
isle
of
all
delights
lying
on
or
just
beneath
the
sea
ancient
kept
the
tradition
most
completely
the
story
goes
that
there
is
a
certain
square
yard
in
the
hundred
of
cemmes
in
that
county
which
holds
the
secret
of
the
fairy
realm
if
a
man
happens
to
set
his
feet
on
it
by
chance
his
eyes
are
opened
and
he
can
see
that
which
is
hidden
from
other
fairy
country
and
commonwealth
the
moment
he
moves
from
the
enchanted
spot
he
loses
the
vision
and
he
can
never
find
the
same
place
again
that
country
is
upon
the
sea
and
not
far
from
shore
like
the
irish
paradise
of
which
it
is
the
counterpart
it
may
sometimes
be
sighted
by
sailors
the
meadows
of
are
still
an
article
of
faith
among
pembrokeshire
and
caermarthenshire
sailors
and
evidently
not
without
some
reason
in
a
correspondent
of
the
county
sent
in
a
report
made
to
him
by
a
certain
captain
john
evans
to
the
effect
that
one
summer
morning
while
trending
up
the
channel
and
passing
gresholm
island
the
scene
of
the
entertaining
of
head
in
what
he
had
always
known
as
deep
water
he
was
surprised
to
see
to
windward
of
him
a
large
tract
of
land
covered
with
a
beautiful
green
meadow
it
was
not
however
above
water
but
two
or
three
feet
below
it
so
that
the
grass
waved
or
swam
about
as
the
ripple
floated
over
it
in
a
way
that
made
one
who
watched
it
feel
drowsy
captain
evans
had
often
heard
of
the
tradition
of
the
fairy
island
from
old
people
but
admitted
that
he
had
never
hoped
to
see
it
with
his
own
eyes
as
with
the
of
one
may
suspect
a
quite
natural
explanation
mirage
is
at
once
common
enough
and
rare
enough
on
our
coasts
to
give
rise
to
such
a
legend
and
it
must
have
been
some
such
phenomenon
as
the
of
sicily
which
has
made
sober
men
swear

confidently
to

survivals

chapter
xxv
survivals
of
the
celtic
paganism
into
modern
times
the
fall
of
the
celtic
state
worship
began
earlier
in
britain
than
in
her
sister
island
neither
was
it
christianity
that
struck
the
first
blow
but
the
rough
humanity
and
stern
justice
of
the
romans
that
people
was
more
tolerant
perhaps
than
any
the
world
has
ever
known
towards
the
religions
of
others
and
gladly
welcomed
the
celtic
its
own
diverse
pantheon
a
friendly
gaulish
or
british
divinity
might
at
any
time
be
granted
the
divine
roman
citizenship
and
be
assimilated
to
jupiter
to
mars
to
apollo
or
to
any
other
properly
accredited
deity
whom
the
romans
deemed
him
to
resemble
it
was
not
against
the
god
but
against
his
worship
at
the
hands
of
his
priests
that
roman
law
struck
the
colossal
human
sacrifices
of
the
druids
horrified
even
a
people
who
were
far
from
squeamish
about
a
little
bloodshed
they
themselves
had
abolished
such
practices
by
a
decree
of
the
senate
before
caesar
first
invaded
britain
and
could
not
therefore
permit
within
their
empire
a
cult
which
slaughtered
men
in
order
to
draw
omens
from
their
druidism
was
first
required
to
be
renounced
by
those
who
claimed
roman
citizenship
then
it
was
vigorously
put
down
among
the
less
civilized
tribes
tacitus
tells
us
how
the
island
of
mona
anglesey
great
stronghold
of
attacked
its
sacred
groves
cut
down
its
altars
laid
level
and
its
priests
put
to
the
sword
pliny
recording
how
the
emperor
tiberius
had
the
congratulates
his
on
having
put
an
end
wherever
their
dominion
extended
to
the
monstrous
customs
inspired
by
the
doctrine
that
the
gods
could
take
pleasure
in
murder
and
cannibalism
the
practice
of
druidism
with
its
attendant
barbarities
abolished
in
britain
wherever
the
long
roman
arm
could
reach
to
strike
took
refuge
beyond
the
northern
wall
among
the
savage
caledonian
tribes
who
had
not
yet
submitted
to
the
yoke
naturally
too
it
remained
untouched
in
ireland
but
before
the
romans
left
britain
it
had
been
extirpated
everywhere
except
among
picts
and
christianity
following
the
roman
rule
completed
the
ruin
of
paganism
in
britain
so
far
at
least
as
its
public
manifestations
were
concerned
in
the
sixth
century
of
our
era
the
monkish
writer
gildas
is
able
to
refer
complacently
to
the
ancient
british
religion
as
a
dead
faith
shall
he
says
those
diabolical
idols
of
my
country
which
almost
surpassed
in
number
those
of
egypt
and
of
which
we
still
see
some
mouldering
away
within
or
without
the
deserted
temples
with
stiff
and
deformed
features
as
was
customary
nor
will
i
cry
out
upon
the
mountains
fountains
or
hills
or
upon
the
rivers
which
now
are
subservient
to
the
use
of
men
but
once
were
an
abomination
and
destruction
to
them
and
to
which
the
blind
people
paid
divine
and
with
the
idols
fell
the
priests
the
very
word
became
obsolete
and
is
scarcely
mentioned
in
the
earliest
british
literature
though
druids
are
prominent
characters
in
the
irish
writings
of
the
same
period
the
secular
arm
had
no
power
in
scotland
and
in
ireland
consequently
the
battle
between
paganism
and
christianity
was
fought
upon
more
equal
terms
and
lasted
longer
in
the
first
country
saint
columba
and
in
the
second
saint
patrick
are
the
personages
who
at
any
rate
according
to
tradition
beat
down
the
druids
and
their
gods
adamnan
abbot
of
iona
who
wrote
his
in
the
last
decade
of
the
seventh
century
describes
how
a
century
earlier
that
saint
had
carried
the
gospel
to
the
picts
their
king
brude
received
him
contemptuously
and
the
royal
druids
left
no
heathen
spell
unuttered
to
thwart
and
annoy
him
but
as
the
power
of
moses
was
greater
than
the
power
of
the
magicians
of
egypt
so
saint
prayers
caused
miracles
more
wonderful
and
more
convincing
than
any
wrought
by
his
adversaries
such
stories
belong
to
the
atmosphere
of
myth
which
has
always
enveloped
heroic
men
the
essential
fact
is
that
the
picts
abandoned
the
old
religion
for
the
new
a
similar
legend
sums
up
the
of
saint
patrick
in
ireland
before
he
came
cromm
cruaich
had
received
from
time
immemorial
his
yearly
toll
of
human
lives
but
saint
patrick
faced
the
gruesome
idol
as
he
raised
his
crozier
we
are
told
the
demon
fell
shrieking
from
his
image
which
deprived
of
its
soul
bowed
forward
to
the
ground
it
is
far
easier
however
to
overthrow
the
more
public
manifestations
of
a
creed
than
to
destroy
its
inner
vital
force
cromm
idol
might
fall
but
his
spirit
would
very
proteus
the
sacred
places
of
the
ancient
celtic
religion
might
be
invaded
the
idols
and
altars
of
the
gods
thrown
down
the
priests
slain
scattered
or
banished
and
the
cult
officially
declared
to
be
extinct
but
driven
from
the
important
centres
it
would
yet
survive
outside
and
around
them
the
more
civilized
gaels
and
britons
would
no
doubt
accept
the
purer
gospel
and
abandon
the
gods
they
had
once
adored
but
the
bulk
of
the
still
cling
to
the
familiar
rites
and
names
a
nobler
belief
and
a
higher
civilization
come
after
all
only
as
surface
waves
upon
the
great
ocean
of
human
life
beneath
their
agitations
lies
a
vast
slumbering
abyss
of
faith
and
thought
to
which
culture
penetrates
with
difficulty
and
in
which
changes
come
very
slowly
we
have
already
shown
how
long
and
how
faithfully
the
gaelic
and
welsh
peasants
clung
to
their
old
gods
in
spite
of
all
the
efforts
of
the
clerics
to
explain
them
as
ancient
kings
to
transform
them
into
saints
or
to
ban
them
as
demons
of
hell
this
conservative
religious
instinct
of
the
agricultural
populations
is
not
confined
to
the
inhabitants
of
the
british
islands
the
modern
greeks
still
believe
in
nereids
in
lamias
in
sirens
and
in
charon
the
dark
ferryman
of
hades
the
descendants
of
the
romans
and
etruscans
hold
that
the
old
etruscan
gods
and
the
roman
deities
of
the
woods
and
fields
still
live
in
the
world
as
spirits
the
high
altars
of
the
of
the
and
his
terrible
kin
were
levelled
and
their
golden
images
and
great
temples
left
to
moulder
in
abandonment
but
the
rude
rustic
shrine
to
the
rude
rustic
god
still
received
its
offerings
it
is
this
shifting
of
the
care
of
the
pagan
cult
from
chief
to
peasant
from
court
to
hovel
and
perhaps
to
some
extent
from
higher
to
lower
race
that
serves
to
explain
how
the
more
primitive
and
uncouth
gods
have
tended
so
largely
to
supplant
those
of
higher
more
graceful
mien
aboriginal
deities
thrust
into
obscurity
by
the
invasion
of
higher
foreign
types
came
back
to
their
own
again
for
it
seems
plain
that
we
must
divide
the
spiritual
population
of
the
british
islands
into
two
classes
there
is
little
in
common
between
the
strictly
and
the
unsightly
elf
who
appears
under
various
names
and
guises
as
pooka
leprechaun
brownie
knocker
or
bogle
the
one
belongs
to
such
divine
tribes
as
the
tuatha
dé
danann
of
gaelic
myth
or
their
kin
the
british
gods
of
the
mabinogion
the
other
owes
his
origin
to
a
quite
different
and
much
lower
kind
of
imagination
one
might
fancy
that
neolithic
man
made
him
in
his
own
image
none
the
less
has
immemorial
tradition
wonderfully
preserved
the
essential
features
of
the
celtic
the
fairy
belief
of
the
present
day
hardly
differs
at
all
from
the
conception
which
the
celts
had
of
their
deities
the
description
of
the
tuatha
dé
danann
in
the
of
the
as
or
fairies
with
corporeal
or
material
forms
but
indued
with
would
stand
as
an
account
of
prevailing
ideas
as
to
the
nor
do
the
irish
and
welsh
fairies
of
popular
belief
differ
from
one
another
both
alike
live
among
the
hills
though
in
wales
a
lake
often
takes
the
place
of
the
both
though
they
war
and
marry
among
themselves
are
both
covet
the
children
of
men
and
will
steal
them
from
the
cradle
leaving
one
of
their
own
uncanny
brood
in
the
mortal
stead
both
can
lay
men
and
women
under
spells
both
delight
in
music
and
the
dance
and
live
lives
of
unreal
and
fantastic
splendour
and
luxury
another
point
in
which
they
resemble
one
another
is
in
their
tiny
size
but
this
would
seem
to
be
the
result
of
the
literary
convention
originated
by
shakespeare
in
genuine
folktales
both
gaelic
and
british
the
fairies
are
pictured
as
of
at
least
mortal
stature
but
aryan
or
iberian
beautiful
or
hideous
they
are
fast
vanishing
from
belief
every
year
the
secluded
valleys
in
which
men
and
women
might
still
live
in
the
old
way
and
dream
the
old
dreams
tend
more
and
more
to
be
thrown
open
to
the
modern
world
of
rapid
movement
and
rapid
thought
the
last
ten
years
have
perhaps
done
more
in
this
direction
than
the
preceding
ten
generations
what
lone
shepherd
or
fisherman
will
ever
see
again
the
vision
of
the
great
manannán
have
the
of
still
any
faith
left
in
finvarra
is
gwyn
ap
nudd
often
thought
of
in
his
own
valleys
of
the
tawë
and
the
nedd
it
would
be
hard
perhaps
to
find
a
believer
even
in
his
local
pooka
or
parish
bogle
it
is
the
ritual
observances
of
the
old
celtic
faith
which
have
better
weathered
and
will
longer
survive
the
disintegrating
influences
of
time
there
are
no
hard
names
to
be
remembered
things
may
still
be
done
for
which
were
once
done
for
religion
customary
observances
die
very
slowly
held
up
by
an
only
half
acknowledged
fear
that
unless
they
are
fulfilled
may
we
shall
get
therefore
more
satisfactory
evidence
of
the
nature
of
the
celtic
paganism
by
examining
such
customs
than
in
any
other
way
we
find
three
forms
of
the
survival
of
the
ancient
religion
into
quite
recent
times
the
first
is
the
celebration
of
the
old
solar
or
agricultural
festivals
of
the
spring
and
autumn
equinoxes
and
of
the
summer
and
winter
solstices
the
second
is
the
practice
of
a
symbolic
human
sacrifice
by
those
who
have
forgotten
its
meaning
and
only
know
that
they
are
keeping
up
an
old
custom
joined
with
late
instances
of
the
actual
sacrifices
of
animals
to
avert
or
to
change
bad
luck
the
third
consists
of
many
relics
of
the
once
universal
worship
of
sacred
waters
trees
stones
and
animals
whatever
may
have
been
the
exact
meaning
of
the
celtic
state
worship
there
seems
to
be
no
doubt
that
it
centred
around
the
four
great
days
in
the
year
which
chronicle
the
rise
progress
and
decline
of
the
sun
and
therefore
of
the
fruits
of
the
earth
these
were
beltaine
which
fell
at
the
beginning
of
may
midsummer
day
marking
the
triumph
of
sunshine
and
vegetation
the
feast
of
lugh
when
in
august
the
of
the
course
had
been
reached
and
the
sad
samhain
when
he
bade
farewell
to
power
and
fell
again
for
half
a
year
under
the
sway
of
the
evil
forces
of
winter
and
darkness
of
these
great
solar
periods
the
first
and
the
last
were
naturally
the
most
important
the
whole
celtic
mythology
seems
to
revolve
upon
them
as
upon
pivots
it
was
on
the
day
of
beltaine
that
partholon
and
his
people
the
discoverers
and
indeed
the
makers
of
ireland
arrived
there
from
the
other
world
and
it
was
on
the
same
day
three
hundred
years
later
that
they
returned
whence
they
came
it
was
on
that
the
gaelic
gods
the
tuatha
dé
danann
and
after
them
the
gaelic
men
first
set
foot
on
irish
soil
it
was
on
the
day
of
samhain
that
the
fomors
oppressed
the
people
of
nemed
with
their
terrible
tax
and
it
was
again
at
samhain
that
a
later
race
of
gods
of
light
and

one
important
mythological
that
was

added
at
a
later
time
upon
any
other
than
one
of
those
two
days
it
was
upon
midsummer
day
one
of
the
lesser
solar
points
that
the
people
of
the
goddess
danu
took
ireland
from
its
inhabitants
the
fir
bolgs
the
mythology
of
britain
preserves
the
same
as
that
of
ireland
if
anything
uncanny
took
place
it
was
sure
to
be
on
it
was
on
night
of
the
first
of
that
rhiannon

and
teirnyon

it
was
every
that
the
two

fought
and
shrieked
in
the
reign
of

it

day
of

that
gwyn
son
of
nudd
fights
with
gwyrthur
son
of

for

it
was
when
she
was
in

woods
and
fields
near
westminster
that
the
same
gwyn
or
melwas
under
his
of
sir
meliagraunce
captured
queen
guinevere
the
nature
of
the
rites
performed
upon
these
days
can
be
surmised
from
their
pale
survivals
they
are
still
celebrated
by
the
descendants
of
the
celts
though
it
is
probable
that
few
of
them
would
even
care
to
may
day
day
lammas
and
are
times
of
ceremony
the
in
ireland
in
scotland
da
in
the
isle
of
man
and
the
calends
of
may
in
the
waking
of
the
earth
from
her
winter
sleep
and
the
renewal
of
warmth
life
and
vegetation
this
is
the
meaning
of
the
now
rarely
seen
in
our
streets
though
shakespeare
tells
us
that
in
his
time
the
festival
was
so
eagerly
anticipated
that
no
one
could
sleep
upon
its
eve
at
midnight
the
people
rose
and
going
to
the
nearest
woods
tore
down
branches
of
trees
with
which
the
sun
when
he
rose
would
find
doors
and
windows
decked
for
him
they
spent
the
day
in
dancing
round
the
with
rude
rustic
mirth
man
joining
with
nature
to
celebrate
the
coming
of
summer
the
opposite
to
it
was
the
day
called
in
ireland
and
scotland
in
man
and
the
night
of
the
winter
calends
in
wales
this
festival
was
a
sad
one
summer
was
over
and
winter
with
its
short
sunless
days
and
long
dreary
nights
was
at
hand
it
was
the
beginning
too
of
the
ancient
celtic
year
and
omens
for
the
future
might
be
extorted
from
dark
powers
by
uncanny
rites
it
was
the
holiday
of
the
dead
and
of
all
the
more
evil
supernatural
beings
says
a
north
cardiganshire
proverb
is
a
bogy
on
every
the
scotch
have
even
invented
a
special
or
goblin
which
comes
out
at
samhain
the
himself
is
said
to
have
instituted
the
august
festival
called
commemoration
in
ireland
in
man
and
august
feast
in
wales
and
it
was
once
of
hardly
less
importance
than
beltaine
or
samhain
it
is
noteworthy
too
that
the
first
of
august
was
a
great
day
at
called
lugudunum
the
town
of
lugus
the
midsummer
festival
on
the
other
hand
has
largely
merged
its
mythological
significance
in
the
christian
feast
of
john
the
characteristic
features
of
these
festivals
give
certain
proof
of
the
original
nature
of
the
great
pagan
ceremonials
of
which
they
are
the
survivals
and
travesties
in
all
of
them
bonfires
are
lighted
on
the
highest
hills
and
the
hearth
fires
solemnly
rekindled
they
form
the
excuse
for
much
sport
and
jollity
but
there
is
yet
something
sinister
in
the
air
the
are
active
and
abroad
and
one
must
be
careful
to
omit
no
prescribed
rite
if
one
would
avoid
kindling
their
anger
or
falling
into
their
power
to
some
of
these
offerings
were
made
down
to
a
comparatively
late
period
when
pennant
wrote
in
the
eighteenth
century
it
was
the
custom
on
in
many
highland
villages
to
offer
libations
and
cakes
not
only
to
the
who
were
believed
to
be
beneficial
to
the
flocks
and
herds
but
also
to
creatures
like
the
fox
the
eagle
and
the
which
so
often
molested
them
at
the
celtic
samhain
the
natives
of
the
hebrides
used
to
pour
libations
of
ale
to
a
marine
god
called
shony
imploring
him
to
send
to
the
shore
in
honour
also
of
such
beings
curious
rites
were
performed
maidens
washed
their
faces
in
morning
dew
with
prayers
for
beauty
they
carried
sprigs
of
the
rowan
that
mystic
tree
whose
scarlet
berries
were
the
ambrosial
food
of
the
tuatha
dé
danann
in
their
original
form
these
now
harmless
rural
holidays
were
undoubtedly
religious
festivals
of
an
orgiastic
such
as
became
so
popular
in
greece
in
connection
with
the
cult
of
dionysus
the
great
of
and
of
the
powers
of
nature
that
made
and
ruled
life
were
propitiated
by
maddening
invocations
by
riotous
dances
and
by
human
sacrifice
the
bonfires
which
fill
so
large
a
part
in
the
modern
festivals
have
been
casually
mentioned
originally
they
were
no
mere
de
but
had
a
terrible
meaning
which
the
customs
connected
with
them
preserve
at
the
highland
beltaine
a
cake
was
divided
by
lot
and
whoever
drew
the
was
obliged
to
leap
three
times
over
the
flames
at
the
midsummer
bonfires
in
ireland
all
passed
through
the
fire
the
men
when
the
flames
were
highest
the
women
when
they
were
lower
and
the
cattle
when
there
was
nothing
left
but
smoke
in
wales
upon
the
last
day
of
october
the
old
samhain
there
was
a
slightly
different
and
still
more
suggestive
rite
the
bonfires
were
watched
until
they
were
announced
to
be
extinct
then
all
would
race
headlong
down
the
hill
shouting
a
formula
to
the
effect
that
the
devil
would
get
the
hindmost
the
devil
of
a
new
belief
is
the
god
of
the
one
it
has
supplanted
in
all
three
instances
the
custom
was
no
mere
meaningless
but
a
symbolical
human
sacrifice
a
similar
observance
but
of
a
more
cruel
kind
was
kept
up
in
france
upon
day
until
forbidden
by
law
in
the
reign
of
louis
the
fourteenth
baskets
containing
living
wolves
foxes
and
cats
were
burned
upon
the
bonfires
under
the
auspices
and
in
the
presence
of
the
sheriffs
or
the
mayor
of
the
town
caesar
noted
the
custom
among
the
druids
of
constructing
huge
images
which
they
filled
with
living
men
and
set
on
fire
and
it
can
hardly
be
doubted
that
the
wretched
wolves
foxes
and
cats
were
ceremonial
substitutes
for
human
beings
an
ingenious
theory
was
invented
after
the
introduction
of
christianity
with
the
purpose
of
allowing
such
ancient
rites
to
continue
with
a
changed
meaning
the
passing
of
persons
and
cattle
through
flame
or
smoke
was
explained
as
a
practice
which
interposed
a
magic
protection
between
them
and
the
powers
of
evil
this
homœopathic
device
of
using
the
evil
own
sacred
fire
as
a
means
of
protection
against
himself
somewhat
suggests
that
seething
of
the
kid
in
its
milk
which
was
reprobated
by
the
levitical
law
but
no
doubt
pagan
were
considered
fair
game
the
explanation
of
course
is
an
obviously
and
clumsily
forced
one
it
was
the
grim
druidical
philosophy
quote
the
life
of
man
was
repaid
for
the
life
of
man
the
will
of
the
immortal
gods
could
not
be
that
dictated
both
the
national
and
the
private
human
sacrifices
of
the
celts
the
shadows
of
which
remain
in
the
leaping
through
the
bonfires
and
in
the
numerous
recorded
sacrifices
of
cattle
within
quite
recent
times
laurence
gomme
in
his
in
has
collected
many
modern
instances
of
the
sacrifices
of
cattle
not
only
in
ireland
and
scotland
but
also
in
wales
yorkshire
northamptonshire
cornwall
and
the
isle
of
man
twenty
miles
of
the
metropolis
of
scotland
a
relative
of
professor
simpson
offered
up
a
live
cow
as
a
sacrifice
to
the
spirit
of
the
in
wales
when
broke
out
a
bullock
was
immolated
by
being
thrown
down
from
the
top
of
a
high
rock
generally
however
the
wretched
victims
were
burned
alive
in
an
isle
of
man
farmer
offered
a
heifer
as
a
burnt
offering
near
tynwald
hill
to
avert
the
anger
of
the
ghostly
occupant
of
a
barrow
which
had
been
desecrated
by
opening
sometimes
even
these
burnt
oblations
were
offered
to
an
alleged
christian
saint
the
registers
of
the
presbytery
of
dingwall
for
the
years
and
contain
records
of
the
sacrifices
of
cattle
upon
the
site
of
an
ancient
temple
in
honour
of
a
being
whom
some
called
and
others
perhaps
knowing
his
doubtful
character
god
at
kirkcudbright
it
was
cuthbert
and
at
clynnog
in
wales
it
was
beuno
who
was
thought
to
delight
in
the
blood
of
bulls
such
sacrifices
of
cattle
appear
mainly
to
have
been
offered
to
stay
plague
among
cattle
man
for
man
and
beast
for
beast
was
perhaps
the
old
rule
but
among
all
nations
human
sacrifices
have
been
gradually
commuted
for
those
of
animals
the
family
of
the
in
ballyvorney
county
cork
used
in
olden
days
to
keep
an
idol
image
of
wood
about
two
feet
high
carved
and
painted
like
a
she
was
the
goddess
of
smallpox
and
to
her
a
sheep
was
immolated
on
behalf
of
anyone
seized
with
that
disease
the
third
form
of
celtic
pagan
survival
is
found
in
numerous
instances
of
the
adoration
of
water
trees
stones
and
animals
like
the
other
nations
the
celts
worshipped
their
rivers
the
dee
received
divine
honours
as
a
with
the
title
of
aerfon
while
the
ribble
under
its
name
of
belisama
was
identified
by
the
romans
with
minerva
myths
were
told
of
them
as
of
the
sacred
streams
of
greece
the
dee
gave
oracles
as
to
the
results
of
the
perpetual
wars
between
the
welsh
and
the
english
as
its
stream
encroached
either
upon
the
welsh
or
the
english
side
so
one
nation
or
the
other
would
be
victorious
the
tweed
like
many
of
the
greek
rivers
was
credited
with
human
descendants
that
the
rivers
of
great
britain
received
human
sacrifices
is
clear
from
the
folklore
concerning
many
of
them
deprived
of
their
expected
offerings
they
are
believed
to
snatch
by
stealth
the
human
lives
for
which
they
crave
of
dart
river
of
dart
every
year
thou
claimest
a
heart
runs
the
devonshire
the
spey
too
requires
a
life
yearly
but
the
spirit
of
the
ribble
is
satisfied
with
one
victim
at
the
end
of
every
seven
years
evidence
however
of
the
worship
of
rivers
is
scanty
compared
with
that
of
the
adoration
of
wells
the
case
of
says
gomme
may
be
asserted
with
some
confidence
that
it
prevails
in
every
county
of
the
three
he
finds
it
most
vital
in
the
gaelic
counties
somewhat
less
so
in
the
british
and
almost
entirely
wanting
in
the
teutonic
so
numerous
indeed
are
that
several
monographs
have
been
written
solely
upon
them
in
some
cases
these
wells
were
resorted
to
for
the
cure
of
diseases
in
others
to
obtain
change
of
weather
or
offerings
were
made
to
them
to
propitiate
their
guardian
gods
or
nymphs
pennant
tells
us
that
in
olden
times
the
rich
would
sacrifice
one
of
their
horses
at
a
well
near
abergeleu
to
secure
a
blessing
upon
the
rest
fowls
were
offered
at
well
near
wrexham
by
epileptic
patients
but
of
late
years
the
have
had
to
be
content
with
much
smaller
trifles
as
pins
rags
coloured
pebbles
and
small
coins
with
sacred
wells
were
often
connected
sacred
trees
to
whose
branches
rags
and
small
pieces
of
garments
were
suspended
by
their
humble
votaries
sometimes
where
the
ground
near
the
well
was
bare
of
vegetation
bushes
were
artificially
placed
beside
the
water
the
same
people
who
venerated
wells
and
trees
would
pay
equal
adoration
to
sacred
stones
lord
roden
describing
in
the
island
of
inniskea
off
the
coast
of
mayo
asserts
that
a
sacred
well
called
and
a
sacred
stone
called
which
was
kept
carefully
wrapped
up
in
flannel
and
brought
out
at
certain
periods
to
be
publicly
adored
seemed
to
be
the
only
deities
known
to
that
lone
atlantic
three
hundred
inhabitants
it
sounds
incredible
but
there
is
ample
evidence
of
the
worship
of
fetish
stones
by
quite
modern
inhabitants
of
our
islands
the
clan
chattan
kept
such
a
stone
in
the
isle
of
arran
it
was
believed
like
the
stone
of
inniskea
to
be
able
to
cure
diseases
and
was
kept
carefully
up
in
fair
linen
cloth
and
about
that
there
was
a
piece
of
woollen
similarly
too
the
worship
of
wells
was
connected
with
the
worship
of
animals
at
a
well
in
the
between
ruckley
and
acton
in
shropshire
lived
and
perhaps
still
live
four
frogs
who
were
and
perhaps
still
are
believed
to
be
devil
and
his
is
to
say
gods
or
demons
of
a
proscribed
idolatry
in
ireland
such
guardian
spirits
are
usually
eels
or
salmon
thought
to
be
endowed
with
eternal
life
the
genius
of
a
well
in
banffshire
took
the
form
of
a
fly
which
was
also
said
to
be
undying
but
to
transmigrate
from
body
to
body
its
function
was
to
deliver
oracles
according
as
it
seemed
active
or
lethargic
its
votaries
drew
their
omens
it
is
needless
to
multiply
instances
of
a
still
surviving
cult
of
water
trees
stones
and
animals
enough
to
say
that
it
would
be
easy
what
concerns
us
is
that
we
are
face
to
face
in
britain
with
living
forms
of
the
oldest
lowest
most
primitive
religion
in
the
which
would
seem
to
have
been
once
universal
and
which
crouching
close
to
the
earth
lets
other
creeds
blow
over
it
without
effacing
it
and
outlives
one
and
all
of
them
it
underlies
the
three
great
and
still
forms
the
real
belief
of
perhaps
the
majority
of
their
titular
adherents
it
is
characteristic
of
the
wisdom
of
the
christian
church
that
knowing
its
power
she
sought
rather
to
sanctify
than
to
extirpate
it
what
once
were
the
celtic
equivalents
of
the
greek
of
the
were
consecrated
as
the
process
of
so
adopting
them
began
early
columba
when
he
went
in
the
sixth
century
to
convert
the
picts
found
a
spring
which
they
worshipped
as
a
god
he
blessed
it
and
that
day
the
demon
separated
from
the
indeed
he
so
sanctified
no
less
than
three
hundred
such
springs
sacred
stones
were
equally
taken
under
the
ægis
of
christianity
some
were
placed
on
the
altars
of
cathedrals
others
built
into
consecrated
walls
the
animal
gods
either
found
themselves
the
heroes
of
christian
legends
or
where
for
some
reason
such
adoption
was
hopeless
were
proclaimed
and
dealt
with
accordingly
such
happened
to
the
hare
a
creature
sacred
to
the
ancient
britons
but
now
in
bad
odour
among
the
superstitious
the
wren
too
is
hunted
to
death
upon
day
in
ireland
its
crime
is
said
to
be
that
it
has
drop
of
the
blood
in
but
the
real
reason
is
probably
to
be
found
in
the
fact
that
the
irish
druids
used
to
draw
auguries
from
its
chirpings
we
have
made
in
this
volume
some
attempt
to
draw
a
picture
of
the
ancient
religion
of
our
earliest
ancestors
the
gaelic
and
the
british
celts
we
have
shown
what
can
be
gathered
of
the
broken
remnants
of
a
mythology
as
splendid
in
conception
and
as
brilliant
in
colour
as
that
of
the
greeks
we
have
tried
to
paint
its
divine
figures
and
to
retell
their
heroic
stories
we
have
seen
them
fall
from
their
shrines
and
yet
rising
again
take
on
new
lives
as
kings
or
saints
or
knights
of
romance
and
we
have
caught
fading
glimpses
of
them
surviving
as
the
their
rites
still
cherished
by
worshippers
who
hardly
know
who
or
why
they
worship
of
necessity
this
survey
has
been
brief
and
incomplete
whether
the
great
edifice
of
the
celtic
mythology
will
ever
be
wholly
restored
one
can
at
present
only
speculate
its
colossal
fragments
are
perhaps
too
deeply
buried
and
too
widely
scattered
but
even
as
it
stands
ruined
it
is
a
mighty
quarry
from
which
poets
yet
unborn
will
hew
spiritual
marble
