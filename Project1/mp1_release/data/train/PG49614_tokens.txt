da
dear
i
dedicate
this
book
to
you
because
whether
you
think
it
well
or
ill
written
you
will
sympathize
with
the
sorrows
and
the
ecstasies
of
its
personages
perhaps
even
more
than
i
do
myself
although
i
wrote
these
stories
at
different
times
and
in
different
manners
and
without
any
definite
plan
they
have
but
one
subject
the
war
of
spiritual
with
natural
order
and
how
can
i
dedicate
such
a
book
to
anyone
but
to
you
the
one
poet
of
modern
ireland
who
has
moulded
a
spiritual
ecstasy
into
verse
my
friends
in
ireland
sometimes
ask
me
when
i
am
going
to
write
a
really
national
poem
or
romance
and
by
a
national
poem
or
romance
i
understand
them
to
mean
a
poem
or
romance
founded
upon
some
famous
moment
of
irish
history
and
built
up
out
of
the
thoughts
and
feelings
which
move
the
greater
number
of
patriotic
irishmen
i
on
the
other
hand
believe
that
poetry
and
romance
can
not
be
made
by
the
most
conscientious
study
of
famous
moments
and
of
the
thoughts
and
feelings
of
others
but
only
by
looking
into
that
little
infinite
faltering
eternal
flame
that
we
call
ourselves
if
a
writer
wishes
to
interest
a
certain
people
among
whom
he
has
grown
up
or
fancies
he
has
a
duty
towards
them
he
may
choose
for
the
symbols
of
his
art
their
legends
their
history
their
beliefs
their
opinions
because
he
has
a
right
to
choose
among
things
less
than
himself
but
he
can
not
choose
among
the
substances
of
art
so
far
however
as
this
book
is
visionary
it
is
irish
for
ireland
which
is
still
predominantly
celtic
has
preserved
with
some
less
excellent
things
a
gift
of
vision
which
has
died
out
among
more
hurried
and
more
successful
nations
no
shining
candelabra
have
prevented
us
from
looking
into
the
darkness
and
when
one
looks
into
the
darkness
there
is
always
something
the
secret
off
most
secret
and
inviolate
rose
enfold
me
in
my
hour
of
hours
where
those
who
sought
thee
at
the
holy
sepulchre
or
in
the
dwell
beyond
the
stir
and
tumult
of
defeated
dreams
and
deep
among
pale
eyelids
heavy
with
the
sleep
men
have
named
beauty
your
great
leaves
enfold
the
ancient
beards
the
helms
of
ruby
and
gold
of
the
crowned
magi
and
the
king
whose
eyes
saw
the
pierced
hands
and
rood
of
elder
rise
in
druid
vapour
and
make
the
torches
dim
till
vain
frenzy
awoke
and
he
died
and
him
who
met
fand
walking
among
flaming
dew
by
a
grey
shore
where
the
wind
never
blew
and
lost
the
world
and
emir
for
a
kiss
and
him
who
drove
the
gods
out
of
their
liss
and
till
a
hundred
morns
had
flowered
red
feasted
and
wept
the
barrows
of
his
dead
and
the
proud
dreaming
king
who
flung
the
crown
and
sorrow
away
and
calling
bard
and
clown
dwelt
among
wanderers
in
deep
woods
and
him
who
sold
tillage
and
house
and
goods
and
sought
through
lands
and
islands
numberless
years
until
he
found
with
laughter
and
with
tears
a
woman
of
so
shining
loveliness
that
men
threshed
corn
at
midnight
by
a
tress
a
little
stolen
tress
i
too
await
the
hour
of
thy
great
wind
of
love
and
hate
when
shall
the
stars
be
blown
about
the
sky
like
the
sparks
blown
out
of
a
smithy
and
die
surely
thine
hour
has
come
thy
great
wind
blows
far
off
most
secret
and
inviolate
rose
the
crucifixion
of
the
outcast
a
man
with
thin
brown
hair
and
a
pale
face
half
ran
half
walked
along
the
road
that
wound
from
the
south
to
the
town
of
sligo
many
called
him
cumhal
the
son
of
cormac
and
many
called
him
the
swift
wild
horse
and
he
was
a
gleeman
and
he
wore
a
short
doublet
and
had
pointed
shoes
and
a
bulging
wallet
also
he
was
of
the
blood
of
the
ernaans
and
his
was
the
field
of
gold
but
his
eating
and
sleeping
places
were
the
four
provinces
of
eri
and
his
abiding
place
was
not
upon
the
ridge
of
the
earth
his
eyes
strayed
from
the
abbey
tower
of
the
white
friars
and
the
town
battlements
to
a
row
of
crosses
which
stood
out
against
the
sky
upon
a
hill
a
little
to
the
eastward
of
the
town
and
he
clenched
his
fist
and
shook
it
at
the
crosses
he
knew
they
were
not
empty
for
the
birds
were
fluttering
about
them
and
he
thought
how
as
like
as
not
just
such
another
vagabond
as
himself
was
hanged
on
one
of
them
and
he
muttered
it
were
hanging
or
bowstringing
or
stoning
or
beheading
it
would
be
bad
enough
but
to
have
the
birds
pecking
your
eyes
and
the
wolves
eating
your
feet
i
would
that
the
red
wind
of
the
druids
had
withered
in
his
cradle
the
soldier
of
dathi
who
brought
the
tree
of
death
out
of
barbarous
lands
or
that
the
lightning
when
it
smote
dathi
at
the
foot
of
the
mountain
had
smitten
him
also
or
that
his
grave
had
been
dug
by
the
and
merrows
deep
at
the
roots
of
the
deep
while
he
spoke
he
shivered
from
head
to
foot
and
the
sweat
came
out
upon
his
face
and
he
knew
not
why
for
he
had
looked
upon
many
crosses
he
passed
over
two
hills
and
under
the
battlemented
gate
and
then
round
by
a
way
to
the
door
of
the
abbey
it
was
studded
with
great
nails
and
when
he
knocked
at
it
he
roused
the
lay
brother
who
was
the
porter
and
of
him
he
asked
a
place
in
the
then
the
lay
brother
took
a
glowing
turf
on
a
shovel
and
led
the
way
to
a
big
and
naked
outhouse
strewn
with
very
dirty
rushes
and
lighted
a
fixed
between
two
of
the
stones
of
the
wall
and
set
the
glowing
turf
upon
the
hearth
and
gave
him
two
unlighted
sods
and
a
wisp
of
straw
and
showed
him
a
blanket
hanging
from
a
nail
and
a
shelf
with
a
loaf
of
bread
and
a
jug
of
water
and
a
tub
in
a
far
corner
then
the
lay
brother
left
him
and
went
back
to
his
place
by
the
door
and
cumhal
the
son
of
cormac
began
to
blow
upon
the
glowing
turf
that
he
might
light
the
two
sods
and
the
wisp
of
straw
but
the
sods
and
the
straw
would
not
light
for
they
were
damp
so
he
took
off
his
pointed
shoes
and
drew
the
tub
out
of
the
corner
with
the
thought
of
washing
the
dust
of
the
highway
from
his
feet
but
the
water
was
so
dirty
that
he
could
not
see
the
bottom
he
was
very
hungry
for
he
had
not
eaten
all
that
day
so
he
did
not
waste
much
anger
upon
the
tub
but
took
up
the
black
loaf
and
bit
into
it
and
then
spat
out
the
bite
for
the
bread
was
hard
and
mouldy
still
he
did
not
give
way
to
his
anger
for
he
had
not
drunken
these
many
hours
having
a
hope
of
heath
beer
or
wine
at
his
end
he
had
left
the
brooks
untasted
to
make
his
supper
the
more
delightful
now
he
put
the
jug
to
his
lips
but
he
flung
it
from
him
straightway
for
the
water
was
bitter
and
then
he
gave
the
jug
a
kick
so
that
it
broke
against
the
opposite
wall
and
he
took
down
the
blanket
to
wrap
it
about
him
for
the
night
but
no
sooner
did
he
touch
it
than
it
was
alive
with
skipping
fleas
at
this
beside
himself
with
anger
he
rushed
to
the
door
of
the
but
the
lay
brother
being
well
accustomed
to
such
outcries
had
locked
it
on
the
outside
so
he
emptied
the
tub
and
began
to
beat
the
door
with
it
till
the
lay
brother
came
to
the
door
and
asked
what
ailed
him
and
why
he
woke
him
out
of
sleep
ails
me
shouted
cumhal
not
the
sods
as
wet
as
the
sands
of
the
three
rosses
and
are
not
the
fleas
in
the
blanket
as
many
as
the
waves
of
the
sea
and
as
lively
and
is
not
the
bread
as
hard
as
the
heart
of
a
lay
brother
who
has
forgotten
god
and
is
not
the
water
in
the
jug
as
bitter
and
as
as
his
soul
and
is
not
the
the
colour
that
shall
be
upon
him
when
he
has
been
charred
in
the
undying
fires
the
lay
brother
saw
that
the
lock
was
fast
and
went
back
to
his
niche
for
he
was
too
sleepy
to
talk
with
comfort
and
cumhal
went
on
beating
at
the
door
and
presently
he
heard
the
lay
foot
once
more
and
cried
out
at
him
cowardly
and
tyrannous
race
of
friars
persecutors
of
the
bard
and
the
gleeman
haters
of
life
and
joy
o
race
that
does
not
draw
the
sword
and
tell
the
truth
o
race
that
melts
the
bones
of
the
people
with
cowardice
and
with
deceit
said
the
lay
brother
also
make
rhymes
i
make
many
while
i
sit
in
my
niche
by
the
door
and
i
sorrow
to
hear
the
bards
railing
upon
the
friars
brother
i
would
sleep
and
therefore
i
make
known
to
you
that
it
is
the
head
of
the
monastery
our
gracious
abbot
who
orders
all
things
concerning
the
lodging
of
may
sleep
said
cumhal
will
sing
a
curse
on
the
and
he
set
the
tub
upside
down
under
the
window
and
stood
upon
it
and
began
to
sing
in
a
very
loud
voice
the
singing
awoke
the
abbot
so
that
he
sat
up
in
bed
and
blew
a
silver
whistle
until
the
lay
brother
came
to
him
can
not
get
a
wink
of
sleep
with
that
noise
said
the
abbot
is
happening
is
a
gleeman
said
the
lay
brother
complains
of
the
sods
of
the
bread
of
the
water
in
the
jug
of
the
and
of
the
blanket
and
now
he
is
singing
a
curse
upon
you
o
brother
abbot
and
upon
your
father
and
your
mother
and
your
grandfather
and
your
grandmother
and
upon
all
your
he
cursing
in
rhyme
is
cursing
in
rhyme
and
with
two
assonances
in
every
line
of
his
the
abbot
pulled
his
off
and
crumpled
it
in
his
hands
and
the
circular
brown
patch
of
hair
in
the
middle
of
his
bald
head
looked
like
an
island
in
the
midst
of
a
pond
for
in
connaught
they
had
not
yet
abandoned
the
ancient
tonsure
for
the
style
then
coming
into
use
we
do
not
somewhat
he
said
will
teach
his
curses
to
the
children
in
the
street
and
the
girls
spinning
at
the
doors
and
to
the
robbers
upon
ben
i
go
then
said
the
other
give
him
dry
sods
a
fresh
loaf
clean
water
in
a
jug
clean
and
a
new
blanket
and
make
him
swear
by
the
blessed
saint
benignus
and
by
the
sun
and
moon
that
no
bond
be
lacking
not
to
tell
his
rhymes
to
the
children
in
the
street
and
the
girls
spinning
at
the
doors
and
the
robbers
upon
ben
bulben
our
blessed
patron
nor
the
sun
and
moon
would
avail
at
all
said
the
abbot
or
the
next
day
the
mood
to
curse
would
come
upon
him
or
a
pride
in
those
rhymes
would
move
him
and
he
would
teach
his
lines
to
the
children
and
the
girls
and
the
robbers
or
else
he
would
tell
another
of
his
craft
how
he
fared
in
the
and
he
in
his
turn
would
begin
to
curse
and
my
name
would
wither
for
learn
there
is
no
steadfastness
of
purpose
upon
the
roads
but
only
under
roofs
and
between
four
walls
therefore
i
bid
you
go
and
awaken
brother
kevin
brother
dove
brother
little
wolf
brother
bald
patrick
brother
bald
brandon
brother
james
and
brother
peter
and
they
shall
take
the
man
and
bind
him
with
ropes
and
dip
him
in
the
river
that
he
may
cease
to
sing
and
in
the
morning
lest
this
but
make
him
curse
the
louder
we
will
crucify
crosses
are
all
full
said
the
lay
brother
we
must
make
another
cross
if
we
do
not
make
an
end
of
him
another
will
for
who
can
eat
and
sleep
in
peace
while
men
like
him
are
going
about
the
world
ill
should
we
stand
before
blessed
saint
benignus
and
sour
would
be
his
face
when
he
comes
to
judge
us
at
the
last
day
were
we
to
spare
an
enemy
of
his
when
we
had
him
under
our
thumb
brother
the
bards
and
the
gleemen
are
an
evil
race
ever
cursing
and
ever
stirring
up
the
people
and
immoral
and
immoderate
in
all
things
and
heathen
in
their
hearts
always
longing
after
the
son
of
lir
and
aengus
and
bridget
and
the
dagda
and
dana
the
mother
and
all
the
false
gods
of
the
old
days
always
making
poems
in
praise
of
those
kings
and
queens
of
the
demons
finvaragh
whose
home
is
under
cruachmaa
and
red
aodh
of
and
cleena
of
the
wave
and
aoibhell
of
the
grey
rock
and
him
they
call
donn
of
the
vats
of
the
sea
and
railing
against
god
and
christ
and
the
blessed
while
he
was
speaking
he
crossed
himself
and
when
he
had
finished
he
drew
the
nightcap
over
his
ears
to
shut
out
the
noise
and
closed
his
eyes
and
composed
himself
to
sleep
the
lay
brother
found
brother
kevin
brother
dove
brother
little
wolf
brother
bald
patrick
brother
bald
brandon
brother
james
and
brother
peter
sitting
up
in
bed
and
he
made
them
get
up
then
they
bound
cumhal
and
they
dragged
him
to
the
river
and
they
dipped
him
in
it
at
the
place
which
was
afterwards
called
ford
said
the
lay
brother
as
they
led
him
back
to
the
do
you
ever
use
the
wit
which
god
has
given
you
to
make
blasphemous
and
immoral
tales
and
verses
for
such
is
the
way
of
your
craft
i
have
indeed
many
such
tales
and
verses
well
nigh
by
rote
and
so
i
know
that
i
speak
true
and
why
do
you
praise
with
rhyme
those
demons
finvaragh
red
aodh
cleena
aoibhell
and
donn
i
too
am
a
man
of
great
wit
and
learning
but
i
ever
glorify
our
gracious
abbot
and
benignus
our
patron
and
the
princes
of
the
province
my
soul
is
decent
and
orderly
but
yours
is
like
the
wind
among
the
salley
gardens
i
said
what
i
could
for
you
being
also
a
man
of
many
thoughts
but
who
could
help
such
a
one
as
you
answered
the
gleeman
soul
is
indeed
like
the
wind
and
it
blows
me
to
and
fro
and
up
and
down
and
puts
many
things
into
my
mind
and
out
of
my
mind
and
therefore
am
i
called
the
swift
wild
and
he
spoke
no
more
that
night
for
his
teeth
were
chattering
with
the
cold
the
abbot
and
the
friars
came
to
him
in
the
morning
and
bade
him
get
ready
to
be
crucified
and
led
him
out
of
the
and
while
he
still
stood
upon
the
step
a
flock
of
great
passed
high
above
him
with
clanking
cries
he
lifted
his
arms
to
them
and
said
great
tarry
a
little
and
mayhap
my
soul
will
travel
with
you
to
the
waste
places
of
the
shore
and
to
the
ungovernable
sea
at
the
gate
a
crowd
of
beggars
gathered
about
them
being
come
there
to
beg
from
any
traveller
or
pilgrim
who
might
have
spent
the
night
in
the
the
abbot
and
the
friars
led
the
gleeman
to
a
place
in
the
woods
at
some
distance
where
many
straight
young
trees
were
growing
and
they
made
him
cut
one
down
and
fashion
it
to
the
right
length
while
the
beggars
stood
round
them
in
a
ring
talking
and
gesticulating
the
abbot
then
bade
him
cut
off
another
and
shorter
piece
of
wood
and
nail
it
upon
the
first
so
there
was
his
cross
for
him
and
they
put
it
upon
his
shoulder
for
his
crucifixion
was
to
be
on
the
top
of
the
hill
where
the
others
were
a
on
the
way
he
asked
them
to
stop
and
see
him
juggle
for
them
for
he
knew
he
said
all
the
tricks
of
aengus
the
the
old
friars
were
for
pressing
on
but
the
young
friars
would
see
him
so
he
did
many
wonders
for
them
even
to
the
drawing
of
live
frogs
out
of
his
ears
but
after
a
while
they
turned
on
him
and
said
his
tricks
were
dull
and
a
shade
unholy
and
set
the
cross
on
his
shoulders
again
another
on
the
way
and
he
asked
them
to
stop
and
hear
him
jest
for
them
for
he
knew
he
said
all
the
jests
of
conan
the
bald
upon
whose
back
a
wool
grew
and
the
young
friars
when
they
had
heard
his
merry
tales
again
bade
him
take
up
his
cross
for
it
ill
became
them
to
listen
to
such
follies
another
on
the
way
he
asked
them
to
stop
and
hear
him
sing
the
story
of
deirdre
and
how
she
endured
many
sorrows
and
how
the
sons
of
usna
died
to
serve
her
and
the
young
friars
were
mad
to
hear
him
but
when
he
had
ended
they
grew
angry
and
beat
him
for
waking
forgotten
longings
in
their
hearts
so
they
set
the
cross
upon
his
back
and
hurried
him
to
the
hill
when
he
was
come
to
the
top
they
took
the
cross
from
him
and
began
to
dig
a
hole
to
stand
it
in
while
the
beggars
gathered
round
and
talked
among
themselves
ask
a
favour
before
i
die
says
cumhal
will
grant
you
no
more
delays
says
the
abbot
ask
no
more
delays
for
i
have
drawn
the
sword
and
told
the
truth
and
lived
my
vision
and
am
you
then
confess
sun
and
moon
not
i
i
ask
but
to
be
let
eat
the
food
i
carry
in
my
wallet
i
carry
food
in
my
wallet
whenever
i
go
upon
a
journey
but
i
do
not
taste
of
it
unless
i
am
starved
i
have
not
eaten
now
these
two
may
eat
then
says
the
abbot
and
he
turned
to
help
the
friars
dig
the
hole
the
gleeman
took
a
loaf
and
some
strips
of
cold
fried
bacon
out
of
his
wallet
and
laid
them
upon
the
ground
will
give
a
tithe
to
the
poor
says
he
and
he
cut
a
tenth
part
from
the
loaf
and
the
bacon
among
you
is
the
poorest
and
thereupon
was
a
great
clamour
for
the
beggars
began
the
history
of
their
sorrows
and
their
poverty
and
their
yellow
faces
swayed
like
gara
lough
when
the
floods
have
filled
it
with
water
from
the
bogs
he
listened
for
a
little
and
says
he
am
myself
the
poorest
for
i
have
travelled
the
bare
road
and
by
the
edges
of
the
sea
and
the
tattered
doublet
of
particoloured
cloth
upon
my
back
and
the
torn
pointed
shoes
upon
my
feet
have
ever
irked
me
because
of
the
towered
city
full
of
noble
raiment
which
was
in
my
heart
and
i
have
been
the
more
alone
upon
the
roads
and
by
the
sea
because
i
heard
in
my
heart
the
rustling
of
the
dress
of
her
who
is
more
subtle
than
aengus
the
and
more
full
of
the
beauty
of
laughter
than
conan
the
bald
and
more
full
of
the
wisdom
of
tears
than
deirdre
and
more
lovely
than
a
bursting
dawn
to
them
that
are
lost
in
the
darkness
therefore
i
award
the
tithe
to
myself
but
yet
because
i
am
done
with
all
things
i
give
it
unto
so
he
flung
the
bread
and
the
strips
of
bacon
among
the
beggars
and
they
fought
with
many
cries
until
the
last
scrap
was
eaten
but
meanwhile
the
friars
nailed
the
gleeman
to
his
cross
and
set
it
upright
in
the
hole
and
shovelled
the
earth
in
at
the
foot
and
trampled
it
level
and
hard
so
then
they
went
away
but
the
beggars
stared
on
sitting
round
the
cross
but
when
the
sun
was
sinking
they
also
got
up
to
go
for
the
air
was
getting
chilly
and
as
soon
as
they
had
gone
a
little
way
the
wolves
who
had
been
showing
themselves
on
the
edge
of
a
neighbouring
coppice
came
nearer
and
the
birds
wheeled
closer
and
closer
outcasts
yet
a
little
while
the
crucified
one
called
in
a
weak
voice
to
the
beggars
keep
the
beasts
and
the
birds
from
but
the
beggars
were
angry
because
he
had
called
them
outcasts
so
they
threw
stones
and
mud
at
him
and
went
their
way
then
the
wolves
gathered
at
the
foot
of
the
cross
and
the
birds
flew
lower
and
lower
and
presently
the
birds
lighted
all
at
once
upon
his
head
and
arms
and
shoulders
and
began
to
peck
at
him
and
the
wolves
began
to
eat
his
feet
he
moaned
you
also
turned
against
the
outcast
out
of
the
rose
one
winter
evening
an
old
knight
in
rusted
rode
slowly
along
the
woody
southern
slope
of
ben
bulben
watching
the
sun
go
down
in
crimson
clouds
over
the
sea
his
horse
was
tired
as
after
a
long
journey
and
he
had
upon
his
helmet
the
crest
of
no
neighbouring
lord
or
king
but
a
small
rose
made
of
rubies
that
glimmered
every
moment
to
a
deeper
crimson
his
white
hair
fell
in
thin
curls
upon
his
shoulders
and
its
disorder
added
to
the
melancholy
of
his
face
which
was
the
face
of
one
of
those
who
have
come
but
seldom
into
the
world
and
always
for
its
trouble
the
dreamers
who
must
do
what
they
dream
the
doers
who
must
dream
what
they
do
after
gazing
a
while
towards
the
sun
he
let
the
reins
fall
upon
the
neck
of
his
horse
and
stretching
out
both
arms
towards
the
west
he
said
divine
rose
of
intellectual
flame
let
the
gates
of
thy
peace
be
opened
to
me
at
last
and
suddenly
a
loud
squealing
began
in
the
woods
some
hundreds
of
yards
further
up
the
mountain
side
he
stopped
his
horse
to
listen
and
heard
behind
him
a
sound
of
feet
and
of
voices
are
beating
them
to
make
them
go
into
the
narrow
path
by
the
gorge
said
someone
and
in
another
moment
a
dozen
peasants
armed
with
short
spears
had
come
up
with
the
knight
and
stood
a
little
apart
from
him
their
blue
caps
in
their
hands
do
you
go
with
the
spears
he
asked
and
one
who
seemed
the
leader
answered
troop
of
came
down
from
the
hills
a
while
ago
and
carried
off
the
pigs
belonging
to
an
old
man
who
lives
by
glen
car
lough
and
we
turned
out
to
go
after
them
now
that
we
know
they
are
four
times
more
than
we
are
we
follow
to
find
the
way
they
have
taken
and
will
presently
tell
our
story
to
de
courcey
and
if
he
will
not
help
us
to
fitzgerald
for
de
courcey
and
fitzgerald
have
lately
made
a
peace
and
we
do
not
know
to
whom
we
by
that
time
said
the
knight
pigs
will
have
been
dozen
men
can
not
do
more
and
it
was
not
reasonable
that
the
whole
valley
should
turn
out
and
risk
their
lives
for
two
or
for
two
dozen
you
tell
me
said
the
knight
the
old
man
to
whom
the
pigs
belong
is
pious
and
true
of
heart
is
as
true
as
another
and
more
pious
than
any
for
he
says
a
prayer
to
a
saint
every
morning
before
his
it
were
well
to
fight
in
his
cause
said
the
knight
if
you
will
fight
against
the
i
will
take
the
main
brunt
of
the
battle
and
you
know
well
that
a
man
in
armour
is
worth
many
like
these
clad
in
wool
and
and
the
leader
turned
to
his
fellows
and
asked
if
they
would
take
the
chance
but
they
seemed
anxious
to
get
back
to
their
cabins
the
treacherous
and
impious
are
treacherous
in
all
their
dealings
said
a
peasant
no
man
has
known
them
to
said
the
knight
will
give
five
crowns
for
the
head
of
every
killed
by
us
in
the
and
he
bid
the
leader
show
the
way
and
they
all
went
on
together
after
a
time
they
came
to
where
a
beaten
track
wound
into
the
woods
and
taking
this
they
doubled
back
upon
their
previous
course
and
began
to
ascend
the
wooded
slope
of
the
mountains
in
a
little
while
the
path
grew
very
straight
and
steep
and
the
knight
was
forced
to
dismount
and
leave
his
horse
tied
to
a
they
knew
they
were
on
the
right
track
for
they
could
see
the
marks
of
pointed
shoes
in
the
soft
clay
and
mingled
with
them
the
cloven
footprints
of
the
pigs
presently
the
path
became
still
more
abrupt
and
they
knew
by
the
ending
of
the
cloven
footprints
that
the
thieves
were
carrying
the
pigs
now
and
then
a
long
mark
in
the
clay
showed
that
a
pig
had
slipped
down
and
been
dragged
along
for
a
little
way
they
had
journeyed
thus
for
about
twenty
minutes
when
a
confused
sound
of
voices
told
them
that
they
were
coming
up
with
the
thieves
and
then
the
voices
ceased
and
they
understood
that
they
had
been
overheard
in
their
turn
they
pressed
on
rapidly
and
cautiously
and
in
about
five
minutes
one
of
them
caught
sight
of
a
leather
jerkin
half
hidden
by
a
an
arrow
struck
the
but
glanced
off
harmlessly
and
then
a
flight
of
arrows
swept
by
them
with
the
buzzing
sound
of
great
bees
they
ran
and
climbed
and
climbed
and
ran
towards
the
thieves
who
were
now
all
visible
standing
up
among
the
bushes
with
their
still
quivering
bows
in
their
hands
for
they
had
only
their
spears
and
they
must
at
once
come
hand
to
hand
the
knight
was
in
the
front
and
smote
down
first
one
and
then
another
of
the
the
peasants
shouted
and
pressing
on
drove
the
before
them
until
they
came
out
on
the
flat
top
of
the
mountain
and
there
they
saw
the
two
pigs
quietly
grubbing
in
the
short
grass
so
they
ran
about
them
in
a
circle
and
began
to
move
back
again
towards
the
narrow
path
the
old
knight
coming
now
the
last
of
all
and
striking
down
thief
after
thief
the
peasants
had
got
no
very
serious
hurts
among
them
for
he
had
drawn
the
brunt
of
the
battle
upon
himself
as
could
well
be
seen
from
the
bloody
rents
in
his
armour
and
when
they
came
to
the
entrance
of
the
narrow
path
he
bade
them
drive
the
pigs
down
into
the
valley
while
he
stood
there
to
guard
the
way
behind
them
so
in
a
moment
he
was
alone
and
being
weak
with
loss
of
blood
might
have
been
ended
there
and
then
by
the
he
had
beaten
off
had
fear
not
made
them
begone
out
of
sight
in
a
great
hurry
an
hour
passed
and
they
did
not
return
and
now
the
knight
could
stand
on
guard
no
longer
but
had
to
lie
down
upon
the
grass
a
more
went
by
and
then
a
young
lad
with
what
appeared
to
be
a
number
of
feathers
stuck
round
his
hat
came
out
of
the
path
behind
him
and
began
to
move
about
among
the
dead
thieves
cutting
their
heads
off
then
he
laid
the
heads
in
a
heap
before
the
knight
and
said
great
knight
i
have
been
bid
come
and
ask
you
for
the
crowns
you
promised
for
the
heads
five
crowns
a
head
they
bid
me
tell
you
that
they
have
prayed
to
god
and
his
mother
to
give
you
a
long
life
but
that
they
are
poor
peasants
and
that
they
would
have
the
money
before
you
die
they
told
me
this
over
and
over
for
fear
i
might
forget
it
and
promised
to
beat
me
if
i
the
knight
raised
himself
upon
his
elbow
and
opening
a
bag
that
hung
to
his
belt
counted
out
the
five
crowns
for
each
head
there
were
thirty
heads
in
all
great
knight
said
the
lad
have
also
bid
me
take
all
care
of
you
and
light
a
fire
and
put
this
ointment
upon
your
and
he
gathered
sticks
and
leaves
together
and
flashing
his
flint
and
steel
under
a
mass
of
dry
leaves
had
made
a
very
good
blaze
then
drawing
off
the
coat
of
mail
he
began
to
anoint
the
wounds
but
he
did
it
clumsily
like
one
who
does
by
rote
what
he
had
been
told
the
knight
motioned
him
to
stop
and
said
seem
a
good
would
ask
something
of
you
for
are
still
a
few
crowns
said
the
knight
i
give
them
to
you
no
said
the
lad
would
be
no
good
to
me
there
is
only
one
thing
that
i
care
about
doing
and
i
have
no
need
of
money
to
do
it
i
go
from
village
to
village
and
from
hill
to
hill
and
whenever
i
come
across
a
good
cock
i
steal
him
and
take
him
into
the
woods
and
i
keep
him
there
under
a
basket
until
i
get
another
good
cock
and
then
i
set
them
to
fight
the
people
say
i
am
an
innocent
and
do
not
do
me
any
harm
and
never
ask
me
to
do
any
work
but
go
a
message
now
and
then
it
is
because
i
am
an
innocent
that
they
send
me
to
get
the
crowns
anyone
else
would
steal
them
and
they
dare
not
come
back
themselves
for
now
that
you
are
not
with
them
they
are
afraid
of
the
did
you
ever
hear
how
when
the
are
christened
the
wolves
are
made
their
godfathers
and
their
right
arms
are
not
christened
at
all
you
will
not
take
these
crowns
my
good
lad
i
have
nothing
for
you
i
fear
unless
you
would
have
that
old
coat
of
mail
which
i
shall
soon
need
no
was
something
i
wanted
yes
i
remember
now
said
the
lad
want
you
to
tell
me
why
you
fought
like
the
champions
and
giants
in
the
stories
and
for
so
little
a
thing
are
you
indeed
a
man
like
us
are
you
not
rather
an
old
wizard
who
lives
among
these
hills
and
will
not
a
wind
arise
presently
and
crumble
you
into
dust
will
tell
you
of
myself
replied
the
knight
now
that
i
am
the
last
of
the
fellowship
i
may
tell
all
and
witness
for
god
look
at
the
rose
of
rubies
on
my
helmet
and
see
the
symbol
of
my
life
and
of
my
and
then
he
told
the
lad
this
story
but
with
always
more
frequent
pauses
and
while
he
told
it
the
rose
shone
a
deep
in
the
firelight
and
the
lad
stuck
the
feathers
in
the
earth
in
front
of
him
and
moved
them
about
as
though
he
made
them
actors
in
the
play
live
in
a
land
far
from
this
and
was
one
of
the
knights
of
saint
john
said
the
old
man
i
was
one
of
those
in
the
order
who
always
longed
for
more
arduous
labours
in
the
service
of
the
most
high
at
last
there
came
to
us
a
knight
of
palestine
to
whom
the
truth
of
truths
had
been
revealed
by
god
himself
he
had
seen
a
great
rose
of
fire
and
a
voice
out
of
the
rose
had
told
him
how
men
would
turn
from
the
light
of
their
own
hearts
and
bow
down
before
outer
order
and
outer
fixity
and
that
then
the
light
would
cease
and
none
escape
the
curse
except
the
foolish
good
man
who
could
not
and
the
passionate
wicked
man
who
would
not
think
already
the
voice
told
him
the
wayward
light
of
the
heart
was
shining
out
upon
the
world
to
keep
it
alive
with
a
less
clear
lustre
and
that
as
it
paled
a
strange
infection
was
touching
the
stars
and
the
hills
and
the
grass
and
the
trees
with
corruption
and
that
none
of
those
who
had
seen
clearly
the
truth
and
the
ancient
way
could
enter
into
the
kingdom
of
god
which
is
in
the
heart
of
the
rose
if
they
stayed
on
willingly
in
the
corrupted
world
and
so
they
must
prove
their
anger
against
the
powers
of
corruption
by
dying
in
the
service
of
the
rose
of
god
while
the
knight
of
palestine
was
telling
us
these
things
we
seemed
to
see
in
a
vision
a
crimson
rose
spreading
itself
about
him
so
that
he
seemed
to
speak
out
of
its
heart
and
the
air
was
filled
with
fragrance
by
this
we
knew
that
it
was
the
very
voice
of
god
which
spoke
to
us
by
the
knight
and
we
gathered
about
him
and
bade
him
direct
us
in
all
things
and
teach
us
how
to
obey
the
voice
so
he
bound
us
with
an
oath
and
gave
us
signs
and
words
whereby
we
might
know
each
other
even
after
many
years
and
he
appointed
places
of
meeting
and
he
sent
us
out
in
troops
into
the
world
to
seek
good
causes
and
die
in
doing
battle
for
them
at
first
we
thought
to
die
more
readily
by
fasting
to
death
in
honour
of
some
saint
but
this
he
told
us
was
evil
for
we
did
it
for
the
sake
of
death
and
thus
took
out
of
the
hands
of
god
the
choice
of
the
time
and
manner
of
our
death
and
by
so
doing
made
his
power
the
less
we
must
choose
our
service
for
its
excellence
and
for
this
alone
and
leave
it
to
god
to
reward
us
at
his
own
time
and
in
his
own
manner
and
after
this
he
compelled
us
to
eat
always
two
at
a
table
to
watch
each
other
lest
we
fasted
unduly
for
some
among
us
said
that
if
one
fasted
for
a
love
of
the
holiness
of
saints
and
then
died
the
death
would
be
acceptable
and
the
years
passed
and
one
by
one
my
fellows
died
in
the
holy
land
or
in
warring
upon
the
evil
princes
of
the
earth
or
in
clearing
the
roads
of
robbers
and
among
them
died
the
knight
of
palestine
and
at
last
i
was
alone
i
fought
in
every
cause
where
the
few
contended
against
the
many
and
my
hair
grew
white
and
a
terrible
fear
lest
i
had
fallen
under
the
displeasure
of
god
came
upon
me
but
hearing
at
last
how
this
western
isle
was
fuller
of
wars
and
rapine
than
any
other
land
i
came
hither
and
i
have
found
the
thing
i
sought
and
behold
i
am
filled
with
a
great
thereat
he
began
to
sing
in
latin
and
while
he
sang
his
voice
grew
fainter
and
fainter
then
his
eyes
closed
and
his
lips
fell
apart
and
the
lad
knew
he
was
dead
has
told
me
a
good
tale
he
said
there
was
fighting
in
it
but
i
did
not
understand
much
of
it
and
it
is
hard
to
remember
so
long
a
and
taking
the
sword
he
began
to
dig
a
grave
in
the
soft
clay
he
dug
hard
and
a
faint
light
of
dawn
had
touched
his
hair
and
he
had
almost
done
his
work
when
a
cock
crowed
in
the
valley
below
he
said
must
have
that
and
he
ran
down
the
narrow
path
to
the
valley
the
wisdom
of
the
king
the
of
the
island
of
woods
had
died
in
childbirth
and
her
child
was
put
to
nurse
with
a
woman
who
lived
in
a
hut
of
mud
and
wicker
within
the
border
of
the
wood
one
night
the
woman
sat
rocking
the
cradle
and
pondering
over
the
beauty
of
the
child
and
praying
that
the
gods
might
grant
him
wisdom
equal
to
his
beauty
there
came
a
knock
at
the
door
and
she
got
up
not
a
little
wondering
for
the
nearest
neighbours
were
in
the
dun
of
the
a
mile
away
and
the
night
was
now
late
is
knocking
she
cried
and
a
thin
voice
answered
for
i
am
a
crone
of
the
grey
hawk
and
i
come
from
the
darkness
of
the
great
in
terror
she
drew
back
the
bolt
and
a
woman
of
a
great
age
and
of
a
height
more
than
human
came
in
and
stood
by
the
head
of
the
cradle
the
nurse
shrank
back
against
the
wall
unable
to
take
her
eyes
from
the
woman
for
she
saw
by
the
gleaming
of
the
firelight
that
the
feathers
of
the
grey
hawk
were
upon
her
head
instead
of
hair
but
the
child
slept
and
the
fire
danced
for
the
one
was
too
ignorant
and
the
other
too
full
of
gaiety
to
know
what
a
dreadful
being
stood
there
cried
another
voice
i
am
a
crone
of
the
grey
hawk
and
i
watch
over
his
nest
in
the
darkness
of
the
great
the
nurse
opened
the
door
again
though
her
fingers
could
scarce
hold
the
bolts
for
trembling
and
another
grey
woman
not
less
old
than
the
other
and
with
like
feathers
instead
of
hair
came
in
and
stood
by
the
first
in
a
little
came
a
third
grey
woman
and
after
her
a
fourth
and
then
another
and
another
and
another
until
the
hut
was
full
of
their
immense
bodies
they
stood
a
long
time
in
perfect
silence
and
stillness
for
they
were
of
those
whom
the
dropping
of
the
sand
has
never
troubled
but
at
last
one
muttered
in
a
low
thin
voice
i
knew
him
far
away
by
the
redness
of
his
heart
under
his
silver
and
then
another
spoke
i
knew
him
because
his
heart
fluttered
like
a
bird
under
a
net
of
silver
and
then
another
took
up
the
word
i
knew
him
because
his
heart
sang
like
a
bird
that
is
happy
in
a
silver
and
after
that
they
sang
together
those
who
were
nearest
rocking
the
cradle
with
long
wrinkled
fingers
and
their
voices
were
now
tender
and
caressing
now
like
the
wind
blowing
in
the
great
wood
and
this
was
their
song
out
of
sight
is
out
of
mind
long
have
man
and
heavy
of
will
and
light
of
mood
taken
away
our
wheaten
food
taken
away
our
altar
stone
hail
and
rain
and
thunder
alone
and
red
hearts
we
turn
to
grey
are
true
till
time
gutter
away
when
the
song
had
died
out
the
crone
who
had
first
spoken
said
have
nothing
more
to
do
but
to
mix
a
drop
of
our
blood
into
his
and
she
scratched
her
arm
with
the
sharp
point
of
a
spindle
which
she
had
made
the
nurse
bring
to
her
and
let
a
drop
of
blood
grey
as
the
mist
fall
upon
the
lips
of
the
child
and
passed
out
into
the
darkness
then
the
others
passed
out
in
silence
one
by
one
and
all
the
while
the
child
had
not
opened
his
pink
eyelids
or
the
fire
ceased
to
dance
for
the
one
was
too
ignorant
and
the
other
too
full
of
gaiety
to
know
what
great
beings
had
bent
over
the
cradle
when
the
crones
were
gone
the
nurse
came
to
her
courage
again
and
hurried
to
the
dun
of
the
and
cried
out
in
the
midst
of
the
assembly
hall
that
the
sidhe
whether
for
good
or
evil
she
knew
not
had
bent
over
the
child
that
night
and
the
king
and
his
poets
and
men
of
law
and
his
huntsmen
and
his
cooks
and
his
chief
warriors
went
with
her
to
the
hut
and
gathered
about
the
cradle
and
were
as
noisy
as
magpies
and
the
child
sat
up
and
looked
at
them
two
years
passed
over
and
the
king
died
fighting
against
the
fer
bolg
and
the
poets
and
the
men
of
law
ruled
in
the
name
of
the
child
but
looked
to
see
him
become
the
master
himself
before
long
for
no
one
had
seen
so
wise
a
child
and
tales
of
his
endless
questions
about
the
household
of
the
gods
and
the
making
of
the
world
went
hither
and
thither
among
the
wicker
houses
of
the
poor
everything
had
been
well
but
for
a
miracle
that
began
to
trouble
all
men
and
all
women
who
indeed
talked
of
it
without
ceasing
the
feathers
of
the
grey
hawk
had
begun
to
grow
in
the
hair
and
though
his
nurse
cut
them
continually
in
but
a
little
while
they
would
be
more
numerous
than
ever
this
had
not
been
a
matter
of
great
moment
for
miracles
were
a
little
thing
in
those
days
but
for
an
ancient
law
of
eri
that
none
who
had
any
blemish
of
body
could
sit
upon
the
throne
and
as
a
grey
hawk
was
a
wild
thing
of
the
air
which
had
never
sat
at
the
board
or
listened
to
the
songs
of
the
poets
in
the
light
of
the
fire
it
was
not
possible
to
think
of
one
in
whose
hair
its
feathers
grew
as
other
than
marred
and
blasted
nor
could
the
people
separate
from
their
admiration
of
the
wisdom
that
grew
in
him
a
horror
as
at
one
of
unhuman
blood
yet
all
were
resolved
that
he
should
reign
for
they
had
suffered
much
from
foolish
kings
and
their
own
disorders
and
moreover
they
desired
to
watch
out
the
spectacle
of
his
days
and
no
one
had
any
other
fear
but
that
his
great
wisdom
might
bid
him
obey
the
law
and
call
some
other
who
had
but
a
common
mind
to
reign
in
his
stead
when
the
child
was
seven
years
old
the
poets
and
the
men
of
law
were
called
together
by
the
chief
poet
and
all
these
matters
weighed
and
considered
the
child
had
already
seen
that
those
about
him
had
hair
only
and
though
they
had
told
him
that
they
too
had
had
feathers
but
had
lost
them
because
of
a
sin
committed
by
their
forefathers
they
knew
that
he
would
learn
the
truth
when
he
began
to
wander
into
the
country
round
about
after
much
consideration
they
decreed
a
new
law
commanding
every
one
upon
pain
of
death
to
mingle
artificially
the
feathers
of
the
grey
hawk
into
his
hair
and
they
sent
men
with
nets
and
slings
and
bows
into
the
countries
round
about
to
gather
a
sufficiency
of
feathers
they
decreed
also
that
any
who
told
the
truth
to
the
child
should
be
flung
from
a
cliff
into
the
sea
the
years
passed
and
the
child
grew
from
childhood
into
boyhood
and
from
boyhood
into
manhood
and
from
being
curious
about
all
things
he
became
busy
with
strange
and
subtle
thoughts
which
came
to
him
in
dreams
and
with
distinctions
between
things
long
held
the
same
and
with
the
resemblance
of
things
long
held
different
multitudes
came
from
other
lands
to
see
him
and
to
ask
his
counsel
but
there
were
guards
set
at
the
frontiers
who
compelled
all
that
came
to
wear
the
feathers
of
the
grey
hawk
in
their
hair
while
they
listened
to
him
his
words
seemed
to
make
all
darkness
light
and
filled
their
hearts
like
music
but
alas
when
they
returned
to
their
own
lands
his
words
seemed
far
off
and
what
they
could
remember
too
strange
and
subtle
to
help
them
to
live
out
their
hasty
days
a
number
indeed
did
live
differently
afterwards
but
their
new
life
was
less
excellent
than
the
old
some
among
them
had
long
served
a
good
cause
but
when
they
heard
him
praise
it
and
their
labour
they
returned
to
their
own
lands
to
find
what
they
had
loved
less
lovable
and
their
arm
lighter
in
the
battle
for
he
had
taught
them
how
little
a
hair
divides
the
false
and
true
others
again
who
had
served
no
cause
but
wrought
in
peace
the
welfare
of
their
own
households
when
he
had
expounded
the
meaning
of
their
purpose
found
their
bones
softer
and
their
will
less
ready
for
toil
for
he
had
shown
them
greater
purposes
and
numbers
of
the
young
when
they
had
heard
him
upon
all
these
things
remembered
certain
words
that
became
like
a
fire
in
their
hearts
and
made
all
kindly
joys
and
traffic
between
man
and
man
as
nothing
and
went
different
ways
but
all
into
vague
regret
when
any
asked
him
concerning
the
common
things
of
life
disputes
about
the
mear
of
a
territory
or
about
the
straying
of
cattle
or
about
the
penalty
of
blood
he
would
turn
to
those
nearest
him
for
advice
but
this
was
held
to
be
from
courtesy
for
none
knew
that
these
matters
were
hidden
from
him
by
thoughts
and
dreams
that
filled
his
mind
like
the
marching
and
of
armies
far
less
could
any
know
that
his
heart
wandered
lost
amid
throngs
of
overcoming
thoughts
and
dreams
shuddering
at
its
own
consuming
solitude
among
those
who
came
to
look
at
him
and
to
listen
to
him
was
the
daughter
of
a
little
king
who
lived
a
great
way
off
and
when
he
saw
her
he
loved
for
she
was
beautiful
with
a
strange
and
pale
beauty
unlike
the
women
of
his
land
but
dana
the
great
mother
had
decreed
her
a
heart
that
was
but
as
the
heart
of
others
and
when
she
considered
the
mystery
of
the
hawk
feathers
she
was
troubled
with
a
great
horror
he
called
her
to
him
when
the
assembly
was
over
and
told
her
of
her
beauty
and
praised
her
simply
and
frankly
as
though
she
were
a
fable
of
the
bards
and
he
asked
her
humbly
to
give
him
her
love
for
he
was
only
subtle
in
his
dreams
overwhelmed
with
his
greatness
she
half
consented
and
yet
half
refused
for
she
longed
to
marry
some
warrior
who
could
carry
her
over
a
mountain
in
his
arms
day
by
day
the
king
gave
her
gifts
cups
with
ears
of
gold
and
findrinny
wrought
by
the
craftsmen
of
distant
lands
cloth
from
over
sea
which
though
woven
with
curious
figures
seemed
to
her
less
beautiful
than
the
bright
cloth
of
her
own
country
and
still
she
was
ever
between
a
smile
and
a
frown
between
yielding
and
withholding
he
laid
down
his
wisdom
at
her
feet
and
told
how
the
heroes
when
they
die
return
to
the
world
and
begin
their
labour
anew
how
the
kind
and
mirthful
men
of
dea
drove
out
the
huge
and
gloomy
and
misshapen
people
from
under
the
sea
and
a
multitude
of
things
that
even
the
sidhe
have
forgotten
either
because
they
happened
so
long
ago
or
because
they
have
not
time
to
think
of
them
and
still
she
half
refused
and
still
he
hoped
because
he
could
not
believe
that
a
beauty
so
much
like
wisdom
could
hide
a
common
heart
there
was
a
tall
young
man
in
the
dun
who
had
yellow
hair
and
was
skilled
in
wrestling
and
in
the
training
of
horses
and
one
day
when
the
king
walked
in
the
orchard
which
was
between
the
foss
and
the
forest
he
heard
his
voice
among
the
salley
bushes
which
hid
the
waters
of
the
foss
blossom
it
said
hate
them
for
making
you
weave
these
dingy
feathers
into
your
beautiful
hair
and
all
that
the
bird
of
prey
upon
the
throne
may
sleep
easy
and
then
the
low
musical
voice
he
loved
answered
hair
is
not
beautiful
like
yours
and
now
that
i
have
plucked
the
feathers
out
of
your
hair
i
will
put
my
hands
through
it
thus
and
thus
and
thus
for
it
casts
no
shadow
of
terror
and
darkness
upon
my
then
the
king
remembered
many
things
that
he
had
forgotten
without
understanding
them
doubtful
words
of
his
poets
and
his
men
of
law
doubts
that
he
had
reasoned
away
his
own
continual
solitude
and
he
called
to
the
lovers
in
a
trembling
voice
they
came
from
among
the
salley
bushes
and
threw
themselves
at
his
feet
and
prayed
for
pardon
and
he
stooped
down
and
plucked
the
feathers
out
of
the
hair
of
the
woman
and
then
turned
away
towards
the
dun
without
a
word
he
strode
into
the
hall
of
assembly
and
having
gathered
his
poets
and
his
men
of
law
about
him
stood
upon
the
daïs
and
spoke
in
a
loud
clear
voice
of
law
why
did
you
make
me
sin
against
the
laws
of
eri
men
of
verse
why
did
you
make
me
sin
against
the
secrecy
of
wisdom
for
law
was
made
by
man
for
the
welfare
of
man
but
wisdom
the
gods
have
made
and
no
man
shall
live
by
its
light
for
it
and
the
hail
and
the
rain
and
the
thunder
follow
a
way
that
is
deadly
to
mortal
things
men
of
law
and
men
of
verse
live
according
to
your
kind
and
call
eocha
of
the
hasty
mind
to
reign
over
you
for
i
set
out
to
find
my
he
then
came
down
among
them
and
drew
out
of
the
hair
of
first
one
and
then
another
the
feathers
of
the
grey
hawk
and
having
scattered
them
over
the
rushes
upon
the
floor
passed
out
and
none
dared
to
follow
him
for
his
eyes
gleamed
like
the
eyes
of
the
birds
of
prey
and
no
man
saw
him
again
or
heard
his
voice
some
believed
that
he
found
his
eternal
abode
among
the
demons
and
some
that
he
dwelt
henceforth
with
the
dark
and
dreadful
goddesses
who
sit
all
night
about
the
pools
in
the
forest
watching
the
constellations
rising
and
setting
in
those
desolate
mirrors
the
heart
of
the
spring
a
very
old
man
whose
face
was
almost
as
fleshless
as
the
foot
of
a
bird
sat
meditating
upon
the
rocky
shore
of
the
flat
and
isle
which
fills
the
widest
part
of
the
lough
gill
a
boy
of
seventeen
years
sat
by
his
side
watching
the
swallows
dipping
for
flies
in
the
still
water
the
old
man
was
dressed
in
threadbare
blue
velvet
and
the
boy
wore
a
frieze
coat
and
a
blue
cap
and
had
about
his
neck
a
rosary
of
blue
beads
behind
the
two
and
half
hidden
by
trees
was
a
little
monastery
it
had
been
burned
down
a
long
while
before
by
sacrilegious
men
of
the
party
but
had
been
roofed
anew
with
rushes
by
the
boy
that
the
old
man
might
find
shelter
in
his
last
days
he
had
not
set
his
spade
however
into
the
garden
about
it
and
the
lilies
and
the
roses
of
the
monks
had
spread
out
until
their
confused
luxuriancy
met
and
mingled
with
the
narrowing
circle
of
the
fern
beyond
the
lilies
and
the
roses
the
ferns
were
so
deep
that
a
child
walking
among
them
would
be
hidden
from
sight
even
though
he
stood
upon
his
toes
and
beyond
the
fern
rose
many
hazels
and
small
oak
trees
said
the
boy
long
fasting
and
the
labour
of
beckoning
after
nightfall
with
your
rod
of
quicken
wood
to
the
beings
who
dwell
in
the
waters
and
among
the
hazels
and
is
too
much
for
your
strength
rest
from
all
this
labour
for
a
little
for
your
hand
seemed
more
heavy
upon
my
shoulder
and
your
feet
less
steady
under
you
than
i
have
known
them
men
say
that
you
are
older
than
the
eagles
and
yet
you
will
not
seek
the
rest
that
belongs
to
he
spoke
in
an
eager
impulsive
way
as
though
his
heart
were
in
the
words
and
thoughts
of
the
moment
and
the
old
man
answered
slowly
and
deliberately
as
though
his
heart
were
in
distant
days
and
distant
deeds
will
tell
you
why
i
have
not
been
able
to
rest
he
said
is
right
that
you
should
know
for
you
have
served
me
faithfully
these
five
years
and
more
and
even
with
affection
taking
away
thereby
a
little
of
the
doom
of
loneliness
which
always
falls
upon
the
wise
now
too
that
the
end
of
my
labour
and
the
triumph
of
my
hopes
is
at
hand
it
is
the
more
needful
for
you
to
have
this
do
not
think
that
i
would
question
you
it
is
for
me
to
keep
the
fire
alight
and
the
thatch
close
against
the
rain
and
strong
lest
the
wind
blow
it
among
the
trees
and
it
is
for
me
to
take
the
heavy
books
from
the
shelves
and
to
lift
from
its
corner
the
great
painted
roll
with
the
names
of
the
sidhe
and
to
possess
the
while
an
incurious
and
reverent
heart
for
right
well
i
know
that
god
has
made
out
of
his
abundance
a
separate
wisdom
for
everything
which
lives
and
to
do
these
things
is
my
are
afraid
said
the
old
man
and
his
eyes
shone
with
a
momentary
anger
at
night
said
the
boy
you
are
reading
with
the
rod
of
quicken
wood
in
your
hand
i
look
out
of
the
door
and
see
now
a
great
grey
man
driving
swine
among
the
hazels
and
now
many
little
people
in
red
caps
who
come
out
of
the
lake
driving
little
white
cows
before
them
i
do
not
fear
these
little
people
so
much
as
the
grey
man
for
when
they
come
near
the
house
they
milk
the
cows
and
they
drink
the
frothing
milk
and
begin
to
dance
and
i
know
there
is
good
in
the
heart
that
loves
dancing
but
i
fear
them
for
all
that
and
i
fear
the
tall
ladies
who
come
out
of
the
air
and
move
slowly
hither
and
thither
crowning
themselves
with
the
roses
or
with
the
lilies
and
shaking
about
their
living
hair
which
moves
for
so
i
have
heard
them
tell
each
other
with
the
motion
of
their
thoughts
now
spreading
out
and
now
gathering
close
to
their
heads
they
have
mild
beautiful
faces
but
aengus
son
of
forbis
i
fear
all
these
beings
i
fear
the
people
of
the
sidhe
and
i
fear
the
art
which
draws
them
about
said
the
old
man
you
fear
the
ancient
gods
who
made
the
spears
of
your
fathers
to
be
stout
in
battle
and
the
little
people
who
came
at
night
from
the
depth
of
the
lakes
and
sang
among
the
crickets
upon
their
hearths
and
in
our
evil
day
they
still
watch
over
the
loveliness
of
the
earth
but
i
must
tell
you
why
i
have
fasted
and
laboured
when
others
would
sink
into
the
sleep
of
age
for
without
your
help
once
more
i
shall
have
fasted
and
laboured
to
no
good
end
when
you
have
done
for
me
this
last
thing
you
may
go
and
build
your
cottage
and
till
your
fields
and
take
some
girl
to
wife
and
forget
the
ancient
gods
i
have
saved
all
the
gold
and
silver
pieces
that
were
given
to
me
by
earls
and
knights
and
squires
for
keeping
them
from
the
evil
eye
and
from
the
enchantments
of
witches
and
by
and
and
ladies
for
keeping
the
people
of
the
sidhe
from
making
the
udders
of
their
cattle
fall
dry
and
taking
the
butter
from
their
churns
i
have
saved
it
all
for
the
day
when
my
work
should
be
at
an
end
and
now
that
the
end
is
at
hand
you
shall
not
lack
for
gold
and
silver
pieces
enough
to
make
strong
the
of
your
cottage
and
to
keep
cellar
and
larder
full
i
have
sought
through
all
my
life
to
find
the
secret
of
life
i
was
not
happy
in
my
youth
for
i
knew
that
it
would
pass
and
i
was
not
happy
in
my
manhood
for
i
knew
that
age
was
coming
and
so
i
gave
myself
in
youth
and
manhood
and
age
to
the
search
for
the
great
secret
i
longed
for
a
life
whose
abundance
would
fill
centuries
i
scorned
the
life
of
fourscore
winters
i
would
be
nay
i
be
like
the
ancient
gods
of
the
land
i
read
in
my
youth
in
a
hebrew
manuscript
i
found
in
a
spanish
monastery
that
there
is
a
moment
after
the
sun
has
entered
the
ram
and
before
he
has
passed
the
lion
which
trembles
with
the
song
of
the
immortal
powers
and
that
whosoever
finds
this
moment
and
listens
to
the
song
shall
become
like
the
immortal
powers
themselves
i
came
back
to
ireland
and
asked
the
fairy
men
and
the
if
they
knew
when
this
moment
was
but
though
all
had
heard
of
it
there
was
none
could
find
the
moment
upon
the
so
i
gave
myself
to
magic
and
spent
my
life
in
fasting
and
in
labour
that
i
might
bring
the
gods
and
the
fairies
to
my
side
and
now
at
last
one
of
the
fairies
has
told
me
that
the
moment
is
at
hand
one
who
wore
a
red
cap
and
whose
lips
were
white
with
the
froth
of
the
new
milk
whispered
it
into
my
ear
a
little
before
the
close
of
the
first
hour
after
dawn
i
shall
find
the
moment
and
then
i
will
go
away
to
a
southern
land
and
build
myself
a
palace
of
white
marble
amid
orange
trees
and
gather
the
brave
and
the
beautiful
about
me
and
enter
into
the
eternal
kingdom
of
my
youth
but
that
i
may
hear
the
whole
song
i
was
told
by
the
little
fellow
with
the
froth
of
the
new
milk
on
his
lips
that
you
must
bring
great
masses
of
green
boughs
and
pile
them
about
the
door
and
the
window
of
my
room
and
you
must
put
fresh
green
rushes
upon
the
floor
and
cover
the
table
and
the
rushes
with
the
roses
and
the
lilies
of
the
monks
you
must
do
this
and
in
the
morning
at
the
end
of
the
first
hour
after
dawn
you
must
come
and
find
you
be
quite
young
then
said
the
boy
will
be
as
young
then
as
you
are
but
now
i
am
still
old
and
tired
and
you
must
help
me
to
my
chair
and
to
my
when
the
boy
had
left
aengus
son
of
forbis
in
his
room
and
had
lighted
the
lamp
which
by
some
contrivance
of
the
gave
forth
a
sweet
odour
as
of
strange
flowers
he
went
into
the
wood
and
began
cutting
green
boughs
from
the
hazels
and
great
bundles
of
rushes
from
the
western
border
of
the
isle
where
the
small
rocks
gave
place
to
gently
sloping
sand
and
clay
it
was
nightfall
before
he
had
cut
enough
for
his
purpose
and
midnight
before
he
had
carried
the
last
bundle
to
its
place
and
gone
back
for
the
roses
and
the
lilies
it
was
one
of
those
warm
beautiful
nights
when
everything
seems
carved
of
precious
stones
sleuth
wood
away
to
the
south
looked
as
though
cut
out
of
green
beryl
and
the
waters
that
mirrored
them
shone
like
pale
opal
the
roses
he
was
gathering
were
like
glowing
rubies
and
the
lilies
had
the
dull
lustre
of
pearl
everything
had
taken
upon
itself
the
look
of
something
imperishable
except
a
whose
faint
flame
burnt
on
steadily
among
the
shadows
moving
slowly
hither
and
thither
the
only
thing
that
seemed
alive
the
only
thing
that
seemed
perishable
as
mortal
hope
the
boy
gathered
a
great
armful
of
roses
and
lilies
and
thrusting
the
among
their
pearl
and
ruby
carried
them
into
the
room
where
the
old
man
sat
in
a
he
laid
armful
after
armful
upon
the
floor
and
above
the
table
and
then
gently
closing
the
door
threw
himself
upon
his
bed
of
rushes
to
dream
of
a
peaceful
manhood
with
his
chosen
wife
at
his
side
and
the
laughter
of
children
in
his
ears
at
dawn
he
rose
and
went
down
to
the
edge
of
the
lake
taking
the
with
him
he
put
some
bread
and
a
flask
of
wine
in
the
boat
that
his
master
might
not
lack
food
at
the
outset
of
his
journey
and
then
sat
down
to
wait
until
the
hour
from
dawn
had
gone
by
gradually
the
birds
began
to
sing
and
when
the
last
grains
of
sand
were
falling
everything
suddenly
seemed
to
overflow
with
their
music
it
was
the
most
beautiful
and
living
moment
of
the
year
one
could
listen
to
the
heart
beating
in
it
he
got
up
and
went
to
find
his
master
the
green
boughs
filled
the
door
and
he
had
to
make
a
way
through
them
when
he
entered
the
room
the
sunlight
was
falling
in
flickering
circles
on
floor
and
walls
and
table
and
everything
was
full
of
soft
green
shadows
but
the
old
man
sat
clasping
a
mass
of
roses
and
lilies
in
his
arms
and
with
his
head
sunk
upon
his
breast
on
the
table
at
his
left
hand
was
a
leathern
wallet
full
of
gold
and
silver
pieces
as
for
a
journey
and
at
his
right
hand
was
a
long
staff
the
boy
touched
him
and
he
did
not
move
he
lifted
the
hands
but
they
were
quite
cold
and
they
fell
heavily
were
better
for
him
said
the
lad
have
told
his
beads
and
said
his
prayers
like
another
and
not
to
have
spent
his
days
in
seeking
amongst
the
immortal
powers
what
he
could
have
found
in
his
own
deeds
and
days
had
he
willed
ah
yes
it
were
better
to
have
said
his
prayers
and
kissed
his
beads
he
looked
at
the
threadbare
blue
velvet
and
he
saw
it
was
covered
with
the
pollen
of
the
flowers
and
while
he
was
looking
at
it
a
thrush
who
had
alighted
among
the
boughs
that
were
piled
against
the
window
began
to
sing
the
curse
of
the
fires
and
of
the
shadows
one
summer
night
when
there
was
peace
a
score
of
puritan
troopers
under
the
pious
sir
frederick
hamilton
broke
through
the
door
of
the
abbey
of
the
white
friars
which
stood
over
the
gara
lough
at
sligo
as
the
door
fell
with
a
crash
they
saw
a
little
knot
of
friars
gathered
about
the
altar
their
white
habits
glimmering
in
the
steady
light
of
the
holy
candles
all
the
monks
were
kneeling
except
the
abbot
who
stood
upon
the
altar
steps
with
a
great
brazen
crucifix
in
his
hand
them
cried
sir
frederick
hamilton
but
none
stirred
for
all
were
new
converts
and
feared
the
crucifix
and
the
holy
candles
the
white
lights
from
the
altar
threw
the
shadows
of
the
troopers
up
on
to
roof
and
wall
as
the
troopers
moved
about
the
shadows
began
a
fantastic
dance
among
the
corbels
and
the
memorial
tablets
for
a
little
while
all
was
silent
and
then
five
troopers
who
were
the
of
sir
frederick
hamilton
lifted
their
muskets
and
shot
down
five
of
the
friars
the
noise
and
the
smoke
drove
away
the
mystery
of
the
pale
altar
lights
and
the
other
troopers
took
courage
and
began
to
strike
in
a
moment
the
friars
lay
about
the
altar
steps
their
white
habits
stained
with
blood
fire
to
the
house
cried
sir
frederick
hamilton
and
at
his
word
one
went
out
and
came
in
again
carrying
a
heap
of
dry
straw
and
piled
it
against
the
western
wall
and
having
done
this
fell
back
for
the
fear
of
the
crucifix
and
of
the
holy
candles
was
still
in
his
heart
seeing
this
the
five
troopers
who
were
sir
frederick
darted
forward
and
taking
each
a
holy
candle
set
the
straw
in
a
blaze
the
red
tongues
of
fire
rushed
up
and
flickered
from
corbel
to
corbel
and
from
tablet
to
tablet
and
crept
along
the
floor
setting
in
a
blaze
the
seats
and
benches
the
dance
of
the
shadows
passed
away
and
the
dance
of
the
fires
began
the
troopers
fell
back
towards
the
door
in
the
southern
wall
and
watched
those
yellow
dancers
springing
hither
and
thither
for
a
time
the
altar
stood
safe
and
apart
in
the
midst
of
its
white
light
the
eyes
of
the
troopers
turned
upon
it
the
abbot
whom
they
had
thought
dead
had
risen
to
his
feet
and
now
stood
before
it
with
the
crucifix
lifted
in
both
hands
high
above
his
head
suddenly
he
cried
with
a
loud
voice
unto
all
who
smite
those
who
dwell
within
the
light
of
the
lord
for
they
shall
wander
among
the
ungovernable
shadows
and
follow
the
ungovernable
fires
and
having
so
cried
he
fell
on
his
face
dead
and
the
brazen
crucifix
rolled
down
the
steps
of
the
altar
the
smoke
had
now
grown
very
thick
so
that
it
drove
the
troopers
out
into
the
open
air
before
them
were
burning
houses
behind
them
shone
the
painted
windows
of
the
abbey
filled
with
saints
and
martyrs
awakened
as
from
a
sacred
trance
into
an
angry
and
animated
life
the
eyes
of
the
troopers
were
dazzled
and
for
a
while
could
see
nothing
but
the
flaming
faces
of
saints
and
martyrs
presently
however
they
saw
a
man
covered
with
dust
who
came
running
towards
them
messengers
he
cried
been
sent
by
the
defeated
irish
to
raise
against
you
the
whole
country
about
manor
hamilton
and
if
you
do
not
stop
them
you
will
be
overpowered
in
the
woods
before
you
reach
home
again
they
ride
between
ben
bulben
and
sir
frederick
hamilton
called
to
him
the
five
troopers
who
had
first
fired
upon
the
monks
and
said
quickly
and
ride
through
the
woods
towards
the
mountain
and
get
before
these
men
and
kill
in
a
moment
the
troopers
were
gone
and
before
many
moments
they
had
splashed
across
the
river
at
what
is
now
called
ford
and
plunged
into
the
woods
they
followed
a
beaten
track
that
wound
along
the
northern
bank
of
the
river
the
boughs
of
the
birch
and
quicken
trees
mingled
above
and
hid
the
cloudy
moonlight
leaving
the
pathway
in
almost
complete
darkness
they
rode
at
a
rapid
trot
now
chatting
together
now
watching
some
stray
weasel
or
rabbit
scuttling
away
in
the
darkness
gradually
as
the
gloom
and
silence
of
the
woods
oppressed
them
they
drew
closer
together
and
began
to
talk
rapidly
they
were
old
comrades
and
knew
each
lives
one
was
married
and
told
how
glad
his
wife
would
be
to
see
him
return
safe
from
this
harebrained
expedition
against
the
white
friars
and
to
hear
how
fortune
had
made
amends
for
rashness
the
oldest
of
the
five
whose
wife
was
dead
spoke
of
a
flagon
of
wine
which
awaited
him
upon
an
upper
shelf
while
a
third
who
was
the
youngest
had
a
sweetheart
watching
for
his
return
and
he
rode
a
little
way
before
the
others
not
talking
at
all
suddenly
the
young
man
stopped
and
they
saw
that
his
horse
was
trembling
saw
something
he
said
yet
i
do
not
know
but
it
may
have
been
one
of
the
shadows
it
looked
like
a
great
worm
with
a
silver
crown
upon
his
one
of
the
five
put
his
hand
up
to
his
forehead
as
if
about
to
cross
himself
but
remembering
that
he
had
changed
his
religion
he
put
it
down
and
said
am
certain
it
was
but
a
shadow
for
there
are
a
great
many
about
us
and
of
very
strange
then
they
rode
on
in
silence
it
had
been
raining
in
the
earlier
part
of
the
day
and
the
drops
fell
from
the
branches
wetting
their
hair
and
their
shoulders
in
a
little
they
began
to
talk
again
they
had
been
in
many
battles
against
many
a
rebel
together
and
now
told
each
other
over
again
the
story
of
their
wounds
and
so
awakened
in
their
hearts
the
strongest
of
all
fellowships
the
fellowship
of
the
sword
and
half
forgot
the
terrible
solitude
of
the
woods
suddenly
the
first
two
horses
neighed
and
then
stood
still
and
would
go
no
further
before
them
was
a
glint
of
water
and
they
knew
by
the
rushing
sound
that
it
was
a
river
they
dismounted
and
after
much
tugging
and
coaxing
brought
the
horses
to
the
in
the
midst
of
the
water
stood
a
tall
old
woman
with
grey
hair
flowing
over
a
grey
dress
she
stood
up
to
her
knees
in
the
water
and
stooped
from
time
to
time
as
though
washing
presently
they
could
see
that
she
was
washing
something
that
half
floated
the
moon
cast
a
flickering
light
upon
it
and
they
saw
that
it
was
the
dead
body
of
a
man
and
while
they
were
looking
at
it
an
eddy
of
the
river
turned
the
face
towards
them
and
each
of
the
five
troopers
recognized
at
the
same
moment
his
own
face
while
they
stood
dumb
and
motionless
with
horror
the
woman
began
to
speak
saying
slowly
and
loudly
you
see
my
son
he
has
a
crown
of
silver
on
his
head
and
there
are
rubies
in
the
then
the
oldest
of
the
troopers
he
who
had
been
most
often
wounded
drew
his
sword
and
cried
have
fought
for
the
truth
of
my
god
and
need
not
fear
the
shadows
of
satan
and
with
that
rushed
into
the
water
in
a
moment
he
returned
the
woman
had
vanished
and
though
he
had
thrust
his
sword
into
air
and
water
he
had
found
nothing
the
five
troopers
remounted
and
set
their
horses
at
the
ford
but
all
to
no
purpose
they
tried
again
and
again
and
went
plunging
hither
and
thither
the
horses
foaming
and
rearing
us
said
the
old
trooper
back
a
little
into
the
wood
and
strike
the
river
higher
they
rode
in
under
the
boughs
the
crackling
under
the
hoofs
and
the
branches
striking
against
their
steel
caps
after
about
twenty
riding
they
came
out
again
upon
the
river
and
after
another
ten
minutes
found
a
place
where
it
was
possible
to
cross
without
sinking
below
the
stirrups
the
wood
upon
the
other
side
was
very
thin
and
broke
the
moonlight
into
long
streams
the
wind
had
arisen
and
had
begun
to
drive
the
clouds
rapidly
across
the
face
of
the
moon
so
that
thin
streams
of
light
seemed
to
be
dancing
a
grotesque
dance
among
the
scattered
bushes
and
small
the
tops
of
the
trees
began
also
to
moan
and
the
sound
of
it
was
like
the
voice
of
the
dead
in
the
wind
and
the
troopers
remembered
the
belief
that
tells
how
the
dead
in
purgatory
are
spitted
upon
the
points
of
the
trees
and
upon
the
points
of
the
rocks
they
turned
a
little
to
the
south
in
the
hope
that
they
might
strike
the
beaten
path
again
but
they
could
find
no
trace
of
it
meanwhile
the
moaning
grew
louder
and
louder
and
the
dance
of
the
white
more
and
more
rapid
gradually
they
began
to
be
aware
of
a
sound
of
distant
music
it
was
the
sound
of
a
bagpipe
and
they
rode
towards
it
with
great
joy
it
came
from
the
bottom
of
a
deep
hollow
in
the
midst
of
the
hollow
was
an
old
man
with
a
red
cap
and
withered
face
he
sat
beside
a
fire
of
sticks
and
had
a
burning
torch
thrust
into
the
earth
at
his
feet
and
played
an
old
bagpipe
furiously
his
red
hair
dripped
over
his
face
like
the
iron
rust
upon
a
rock
you
see
my
wife
he
cried
looking
up
a
moment
was
washing
she
was
washing
am
afraid
of
him
said
the
young
trooper
fear
he
is
one
of
the
said
the
old
trooper
is
a
man
for
i
can
see
the
upon
his
face
we
will
compel
him
to
be
our
and
at
that
he
drew
his
sword
and
the
others
did
the
same
they
stood
in
a
ring
round
the
piper
and
pointed
their
swords
at
him
and
the
old
trooper
then
told
him
that
they
must
kill
two
rebels
who
had
taken
the
road
between
ben
bulben
and
the
great
mountain
spur
that
is
called
and
that
he
must
get
up
before
one
of
them
and
be
their
guide
for
they
had
lost
their
way
the
piper
turned
and
pointed
to
a
neighbouring
tree
and
they
saw
an
old
white
horse
ready
bitted
bridled
and
saddled
he
slung
the
pipe
across
his
back
and
taking
the
torch
in
his
hand
got
upon
the
horse
and
started
off
before
them
as
hard
as
he
could
go
the
wood
grew
thinner
and
thinner
and
the
ground
began
to
slope
up
toward
the
mountain
the
moon
had
already
set
and
the
little
white
flames
of
the
stars
had
come
out
everywhere
the
ground
sloped
more
and
more
until
at
last
they
rode
far
above
the
woods
upon
the
wide
top
of
the
mountain
the
woods
lay
spread
out
mile
after
mile
below
and
away
to
the
south
shot
up
the
red
glare
of
the
burning
town
but
before
and
above
them
were
the
little
white
flames
the
guide
drew
rein
suddenly
and
pointing
upwards
with
the
hand
that
did
not
hold
the
torch
shrieked
out
look
at
the
holy
candles
and
then
plunged
forward
at
a
gallop
waving
the
torch
hither
and
thither
you
hear
the
hoofs
of
the
messengers
cried
the
guide
quick
or
they
will
be
gone
out
of
your
hands
and
he
laughed
as
with
delight
of
the
chase
the
troopers
thought
they
could
hear
far
off
and
as
if
below
them
rattle
of
hoofs
but
now
the
ground
began
to
slope
more
and
more
and
the
speed
grew
more
headlong
moment
by
moment
they
tried
to
pull
up
but
in
vain
for
the
horses
seemed
to
have
gone
mad
the
guide
had
thrown
the
reins
on
to
the
neck
of
the
old
white
horse
and
was
waving
his
arms
and
singing
a
wild
gaelic
song
suddenly
they
saw
the
thin
gleam
of
a
river
at
an
immense
distance
below
and
knew
that
they
were
upon
the
brink
of
the
abyss
that
is
now
called
or
in
english
the
leap
the
six
horses
sprang
forward
and
five
screams
went
up
into
the
air
a
moment
later
five
men
and
horses
fell
with
a
dull
crash
upon
the
green
slopes
at
the
foot
of
the
rocks
the
old
men
of
the
twilight
at
the
place
close
to
the
dead
point
at
the
rosses
where
the
disused
looks
out
to
sea
through
two
round
windows
like
eyes
a
mud
cottage
stood
in
the
last
century
it
also
was
a
watchhouse
for
a
certain
old
michael
bruen
who
had
been
a
smuggler
in
his
day
and
was
still
the
father
and
grandfather
of
smugglers
lived
there
and
when
after
nightfall
a
tall
schooner
crept
over
the
bay
from
roughley
it
was
his
business
to
hang
a
horn
lanthorn
in
the
southern
window
that
the
news
might
travel
to
island
and
from
thence
by
another
horn
lanthorn
to
the
village
of
the
rosses
but
for
this
glimmering
of
messages
he
had
little
communion
with
mankind
for
he
was
very
old
and
had
no
thought
for
anything
but
for
the
making
of
his
soul
at
the
foot
of
the
spanish
crucifix
of
carved
oak
that
hung
by
his
chimney
or
bent
double
over
the
rosary
of
stone
beads
brought
to
him
in
a
cargo
of
silks
and
laces
out
of
france
one
night
he
had
watched
hour
after
hour
because
a
gentle
and
favourable
wind
was
blowing
and
mère
de
was
much
overdue
and
he
was
about
to
lie
down
upon
his
heap
of
straw
seeing
that
the
dawn
was
whitening
the
east
and
that
the
schooner
would
not
dare
to
round
roughley
and
come
to
an
anchor
after
daybreak
when
he
saw
a
long
line
of
herons
flying
slowly
from
island
and
towards
the
pools
which
lie
half
choked
with
reeds
behind
what
is
called
the
second
rosses
he
had
never
before
seen
herons
flying
over
the
sea
for
they
are
birds
and
partly
because
this
had
startled
him
out
of
his
drowsiness
and
more
because
the
long
delay
of
the
schooner
kept
his
cupboard
empty
he
took
down
his
rusty
of
which
the
barrel
was
tied
on
with
a
piece
of
string
and
followed
them
towards
the
pools
when
he
came
close
enough
to
hear
the
sighing
of
the
rushes
in
the
outermost
pool
the
morning
was
grey
over
the
world
so
that
the
tall
rushes
the
still
waters
the
vague
clouds
the
thin
mist
lying
among
the
seemed
carved
out
of
an
enormous
pearl
in
a
little
he
came
upon
the
herons
of
whom
there
were
a
great
number
standing
with
lifted
legs
in
the
shallow
water
and
crouching
down
behind
a
bank
of
rushes
looked
to
the
priming
of
his
gun
and
bent
for
a
moment
over
his
rosary
to
murmur
patrick
let
me
shoot
a
heron
made
into
a
pie
it
will
support
me
for
nearly
four
days
for
i
no
longer
eat
as
in
my
youth
if
you
keep
me
from
missing
i
will
say
a
rosary
to
you
every
night
until
the
pie
is
then
he
lay
down
and
resting
his
gun
upon
a
large
stone
turned
towards
a
heron
which
stood
upon
a
bank
of
smooth
grass
over
a
little
stream
that
flowed
into
the
pool
for
he
feared
to
take
the
rheumatism
by
wading
as
he
would
have
to
do
if
he
shot
one
of
those
which
stood
in
the
water
but
when
he
looked
along
the
barrel
the
heron
was
gone
and
to
his
wonder
and
terror
a
man
of
infinitely
great
age
and
infirmity
stood
in
its
place
he
lowered
the
gun
and
the
heron
stood
there
with
bent
head
and
motionless
feathers
as
though
it
had
slept
from
the
beginning
of
the
world
he
raised
the
gun
and
no
sooner
did
he
look
along
the
iron
than
that
enemy
of
all
enchantment
brought
the
old
man
again
before
him
only
to
vanish
when
he
lowered
the
gun
for
the
second
time
he
laid
the
gun
down
and
crossed
himself
three
times
and
said
a
and
an
and
muttered
half
aloud
enemy
of
god
and
of
my
patron
is
standing
upon
the
smooth
place
and
fishing
in
the
blessed
water
and
then
aimed
very
carefully
and
slowly
he
fired
and
when
the
smoke
had
gone
saw
an
old
man
huddled
upon
the
grass
and
a
long
line
of
herons
flying
with
clamour
towards
the
sea
he
went
round
a
bend
of
the
pool
and
coming
to
the
little
stream
looked
down
on
a
figure
wrapped
in
faded
clothes
of
black
and
green
of
an
ancient
pattern
and
spotted
with
blood
he
shook
his
head
at
the
sight
of
so
great
a
wickedness
suddenly
the
clothes
moved
and
an
arm
was
stretched
upwards
towards
the
rosary
which
hung
about
his
neck
and
long
wasted
fingers
almost
touched
the
cross
he
started
back
crying
i
will
let
no
wicked
thing
touch
my
blessed
and
the
sense
of
a
great
danger
just
escaped
made
him
tremble
you
listen
to
me
replied
a
voice
so
faint
that
it
was
like
a
sigh
will
know
that
i
am
not
a
wizard
and
you
will
let
me
kiss
the
cross
before
i
will
listen
to
you
he
answered
i
will
not
let
you
touch
my
blessed
beads
and
sitting
on
the
grass
a
little
way
from
the
dying
man
he
reloaded
his
gun
and
laid
it
across
his
knees
and
composed
himself
to
listen
know
not
how
many
generations
ago
we
who
are
now
herons
were
the
men
of
learning
of
the
king
leaghaire
we
neither
hunted
nor
went
to
battle
nor
listened
to
the
druids
preaching
and
even
love
if
it
came
to
us
at
all
was
but
a
passing
fire
the
druids
and
the
poets
told
us
many
and
many
a
time
of
a
new
druid
patrick
and
most
among
them
were
fierce
against
him
while
a
few
thought
his
doctrine
merely
the
doctrine
of
the
gods
set
out
in
new
symbols
and
were
for
giving
him
welcome
but
we
yawned
in
the
midst
of
their
tale
at
last
they
came
crying
that
he
was
coming
to
the
house
and
fell
to
their
dispute
but
we
would
listen
to
neither
party
for
we
were
busy
with
a
dispute
about
the
merits
of
the
great
and
of
the
little
metre
nor
were
we
disturbed
when
they
passed
our
door
with
sticks
of
enchantment
under
their
arms
travelling
towards
the
forest
to
contend
against
his
coming
nor
when
they
returned
after
nightfall
with
torn
robes
and
despairing
cries
for
the
click
of
our
knives
writing
our
thoughts
in
ogham
filled
us
with
peace
and
our
dispute
filled
us
with
joy
nor
even
when
in
the
morning
crowds
passed
us
to
hear
the
strange
druid
preaching
the
commandments
of
his
god
the
crowds
passed
and
one
who
had
laid
down
his
knife
to
yawn
and
stretch
himself
heard
a
voice
speaking
far
off
and
knew
that
the
druid
patrick
was
preaching
within
the
house
but
our
hearts
were
deaf
and
we
carved
and
disputed
and
read
and
laughed
a
thin
laughter
together
in
a
little
we
heard
many
feet
coming
towards
the
house
and
presently
two
tall
figures
stood
in
the
door
the
one
in
white
the
other
in
a
crimson
robe
like
a
great
lily
and
a
heavy
poppy
and
we
knew
the
druid
patrick
and
our
king
leaghaire
we
laid
down
the
slender
knives
and
bowed
before
the
king
but
when
the
black
and
green
robes
had
ceased
to
rustle
it
was
not
the
loud
rough
voice
of
king
leaghaire
that
spoke
to
us
but
a
strange
voice
in
which
there
was
a
rapture
as
of
one
speaking
from
behind
a
battlement
of
druid
flame
preached
the
commandments
of
the
maker
of
the
world
it
said
the
house
and
from
the
centre
of
the
earth
to
the
windows
of
heaven
there
was
a
great
silence
so
that
the
eagle
floated
with
unmoving
wings
in
the
white
air
and
the
fish
with
unmoving
fins
in
the
dim
water
while
the
linnets
and
the
wrens
and
the
sparrows
stilled
their
tongues
in
the
heavy
boughs
and
the
clouds
were
like
white
marble
and
the
rivers
became
their
motionless
mirrors
and
the
shrimps
in
the
were
still
enduring
eternity
in
patience
although
it
was
and
as
he
named
these
things
it
was
like
a
king
numbering
his
people
your
slender
knives
went
click
click
upon
the
oaken
staves
and
all
else
being
silent
the
sound
shook
the
angels
with
anger
o
little
roots
nipped
by
the
winter
who
do
not
awake
although
the
summer
pass
above
you
with
innumerable
feet
o
men
who
have
no
part
in
love
who
have
no
part
in
song
who
have
no
part
in
wisdom
but
dwell
with
the
shadows
of
memory
where
the
feet
of
angels
can
not
touch
you
as
they
pass
over
your
heads
where
the
hair
of
demons
can
not
sweep
about
you
as
they
pass
under
your
feet
i
lay
upon
you
a
curse
and
change
you
to
an
example
for
ever
and
ever
you
shall
become
grey
herons
and
stand
pondering
in
grey
pools
and
flit
over
the
world
in
that
hour
when
it
is
most
full
of
sighs
having
forgotten
the
flame
of
the
stars
and
not
yet
found
the
flame
of
the
sun
and
you
shall
preach
to
the
other
herons
until
they
also
are
like
you
and
are
an
example
for
ever
and
ever
and
your
deaths
shall
come
to
you
by
chance
and
unforeseen
that
no
fire
of
certainty
may
visit
your
the
voice
of
the
old
man
of
learning
became
still
but
the
voteen
bent
over
his
gun
with
his
eyes
upon
the
ground
trying
in
vain
to
understand
something
of
this
tale
and
he
had
so
bent
it
may
be
for
a
long
time
had
not
a
tug
at
his
rosary
made
him
start
out
of
his
dream
the
old
man
of
learning
had
crawled
along
the
grass
and
was
now
trying
to
draw
the
cross
down
low
enough
for
his
lips
to
reach
it
must
not
touch
my
blessed
beads
cried
the
voteen
and
struck
the
long
withered
fingers
with
the
barrel
of
his
gun
he
need
not
have
trembled
for
the
old
man
fell
back
upon
the
grass
with
a
sigh
and
was
still
he
bent
down
and
began
to
consider
the
black
and
green
clothes
for
his
fear
had
begun
to
pass
away
when
he
came
to
understand
that
he
had
something
the
man
of
learning
wanted
and
pleaded
for
and
now
that
the
blessed
beads
were
safe
his
fear
had
nearly
all
gone
and
surely
he
thought
if
that
big
cloak
and
that
little
cloak
under
it
were
warm
and
without
holes
saint
patrick
would
take
the
enchantment
out
of
them
and
leave
them
fit
for
human
use
but
the
black
and
green
clothes
fell
away
wherever
his
fingers
touched
them
and
while
this
was
a
new
wonder
a
slight
wind
blew
over
the
pool
and
crumbled
the
old
man
of
learning
and
all
his
ancient
gear
into
a
little
heap
of
dust
and
then
made
the
little
heap
less
and
less
until
there
was
nothing
but
the
smooth
green
grass
where
there
is
nothing
there
is
god
the
little
wicker
houses
at
tullagh
where
the
brothers
were
accustomed
to
pray
or
bend
over
many
handicrafts
when
twilight
had
driven
them
from
the
fields
were
empty
for
the
hardness
of
the
winter
had
brought
the
brotherhood
together
in
the
little
wooden
house
under
the
shadow
of
the
wooden
chapel
and
abbot
malathgeneus
brother
dove
brother
bald
fox
brother
peter
brother
patrick
brother
bittern
brother
and
many
too
young
to
have
won
names
in
the
great
battle
sat
about
the
fire
with
ruddy
faces
one
mending
lines
to
lay
in
the
river
for
eels
one
fashioning
a
snare
for
birds
one
mending
the
broken
handle
of
a
spade
one
writing
in
a
large
book
and
one
shaping
a
jewelled
box
to
hold
the
book
and
among
the
rushes
at
their
feet
lay
the
scholars
who
would
one
day
be
brothers
and
whose
it
was
and
for
the
succour
of
whose
tender
years
the
great
fire
was
supposed
to
leap
and
flicker
one
of
these
a
child
of
eight
or
nine
years
called
olioll
lay
upon
his
back
looking
up
through
the
hole
in
the
roof
through
which
the
smoke
went
and
watching
the
stars
appearing
and
disappearing
in
the
smoke
with
mild
eyes
like
the
eyes
of
a
beast
of
the
field
he
turned
presently
to
the
brother
who
wrote
in
the
big
book
and
whose
duty
was
to
teach
the
children
and
said
dove
to
what
are
the
stars
fastened
the
brother
rejoicing
to
see
so
much
curiosity
in
the
stupidest
of
his
scholars
laid
down
the
pen
and
said
are
nine
crystalline
spheres
and
on
the
first
the
moon
is
fastened
on
the
second
the
planet
mercury
on
the
third
the
planet
venus
on
the
fourth
the
sun
on
the
fifth
the
planet
mars
on
the
sixth
the
planet
jupiter
on
the
seventh
the
planet
saturn
these
are
the
wandering
stars
and
on
the
eighth
are
fastened
the
fixed
stars
but
the
ninth
sphere
is
a
sphere
of
the
substance
on
which
the
breath
of
god
moved
in
the
is
beyond
that
said
the
child
is
nothing
beyond
that
there
is
and
then
the
eyes
strayed
to
the
jewelled
box
where
one
great
ruby
was
gleaming
in
the
light
of
the
fire
and
he
said
has
brother
peter
put
a
great
ruby
on
the
side
of
the
box
ruby
is
a
symbol
of
the
love
of
is
the
ruby
a
symbol
of
the
love
of
god
it
is
red
like
fire
and
fire
burns
up
everything
and
where
there
is
nothing
there
is
the
child
sank
into
silence
but
presently
sat
up
and
said
is
somebody
replied
the
brother
is
only
the
wolves
i
have
heard
them
moving
about
in
the
snow
for
some
time
they
are
growing
very
wild
now
that
the
winter
drives
them
from
the
mountains
they
broke
into
a
fold
last
night
and
carried
off
many
sheep
and
if
we
are
not
careful
they
will
devour
it
is
the
footstep
of
a
man
for
it
is
heavy
but
i
can
hear
the
footsteps
of
the
wolves
he
had
no
sooner
done
speaking
than
somebody
rapped
three
times
but
with
no
great
loudness
will
go
and
open
for
he
must
be
very
not
open
for
it
may
be
a
and
he
may
devour
us
but
the
boy
had
already
drawn
back
the
heavy
wooden
bolt
and
all
the
faces
most
of
them
a
little
pale
turned
towards
the
door
has
beads
and
a
cross
he
can
not
be
a
said
the
child
as
a
man
with
the
snow
heavy
on
his
long
ragged
beard
and
on
the
matted
hair
that
fell
over
his
shoulders
and
nearly
to
his
waist
and
dropping
from
the
tattered
cloak
that
but
his
withered
brown
body
came
in
and
looked
from
face
to
face
with
mild
ecstatic
eyes
standing
some
way
from
the
fire
and
with
eyes
that
had
rested
at
last
upon
the
abbot
malathgeneus
he
cried
out
blessed
abbot
let
me
come
to
the
fire
and
warm
myself
and
dry
the
snow
from
my
beard
and
my
hair
and
my
cloak
that
i
may
not
die
of
the
cold
of
the
mountains
and
anger
the
lord
with
a
wilful
to
the
fire
said
the
abbot
warm
yourself
and
eat
the
food
the
boy
olioll
will
bring
you
it
is
sad
indeed
that
any
for
whom
christ
has
died
should
be
as
poor
as
the
man
sat
over
the
fire
and
olioll
took
away
his
now
dripping
cloak
and
laid
meat
and
bread
and
wine
before
him
but
he
would
eat
only
of
the
bread
and
he
put
away
the
wine
asking
for
water
when
his
beard
and
hair
had
begun
to
dry
a
little
and
his
limbs
had
ceased
to
shiver
with
the
cold
he
spoke
again
blessed
abbot
have
pity
on
the
poor
have
pity
on
a
beggar
who
has
trodden
the
bare
world
this
many
a
year
and
give
me
some
labour
to
do
the
hardest
there
is
for
i
am
the
poorest
of
then
the
brothers
discussed
together
what
work
they
could
put
him
to
and
at
first
to
little
purpose
for
there
was
no
labour
that
had
not
found
its
labourer
in
that
busy
community
but
at
last
one
remembered
that
brother
bald
fox
whose
business
it
was
to
turn
the
great
quern
in
the
for
he
was
too
stupid
for
anything
else
was
getting
old
for
so
heavy
a
labour
and
so
the
beggar
was
put
to
the
quern
from
the
morrow
the
cold
passed
away
and
the
spring
grew
to
summer
and
the
quern
was
never
idle
nor
was
it
turned
with
grudging
labour
for
when
any
passed
the
beggar
was
heard
singing
as
he
drove
the
handle
round
the
last
gloom
too
had
passed
from
that
happy
community
for
olioll
who
had
always
been
stupid
and
unteachable
grew
clever
and
this
was
the
more
miraculous
because
it
had
come
of
a
sudden
one
day
he
had
been
even
duller
than
usual
and
was
beaten
and
told
to
know
his
lesson
better
on
the
morrow
or
be
sent
into
a
lower
class
among
little
boys
who
would
make
a
joke
of
him
he
had
gone
out
in
tears
and
when
he
came
the
next
day
although
his
stupidity
born
of
a
mind
that
would
listen
to
every
wandering
sound
and
brood
upon
every
wandering
light
had
so
long
been
the
byword
of
the
school
he
knew
his
lesson
so
well
that
he
passed
to
the
head
of
the
class
and
from
that
day
was
the
best
of
scholars
at
first
brother
dove
thought
this
was
an
answer
to
his
own
prayers
to
the
virgin
and
took
it
for
a
great
proof
of
the
love
she
bore
him
but
when
many
far
more
fervid
prayers
had
failed
to
add
a
single
wheatsheaf
to
the
harvest
he
began
to
think
that
the
child
was
trafficking
with
bards
or
druids
or
witches
and
resolved
to
follow
and
watch
he
had
told
his
thought
to
the
abbot
who
bid
him
come
to
him
the
moment
he
hit
the
truth
and
the
next
day
which
was
a
sunday
he
stood
in
the
path
when
the
abbot
and
the
brothers
were
coming
from
vespers
with
their
white
habits
upon
them
and
took
the
abbot
by
the
habit
and
said
beggar
is
of
the
greatest
of
saints
and
of
the
workers
of
miracle
i
followed
olioll
but
now
and
by
his
slow
steps
and
his
bent
head
i
saw
that
the
weariness
of
his
stupidity
was
over
him
and
when
he
came
to
the
little
wood
by
the
i
knew
by
the
path
broken
in
the
and
by
the
in
the
muddy
places
that
he
had
gone
that
way
many
times
i
hid
behind
a
bush
where
the
path
doubled
upon
itself
at
a
sloping
place
and
understood
by
the
tears
in
his
eyes
that
his
stupidity
was
too
old
and
his
wisdom
too
new
to
save
him
from
terror
of
the
rod
when
he
was
in
the
i
went
to
the
window
and
looked
in
and
the
birds
came
down
and
perched
upon
my
head
and
my
shoulders
for
they
are
not
timid
in
that
holy
place
and
a
wolf
passed
by
his
right
side
shaking
my
habit
his
left
the
leaves
of
a
bush
olioll
opened
his
book
and
turned
to
the
page
i
had
told
him
to
learn
and
began
to
cry
and
the
beggar
sat
beside
him
and
comforted
him
until
he
fell
asleep
when
his
sleep
was
of
the
deepest
the
beggar
knelt
down
and
prayed
aloud
and
said
thou
who
dwellest
beyond
the
stars
show
forth
thy
power
as
at
the
beginning
and
let
knowledge
sent
from
thee
awaken
in
his
mind
wherein
is
nothing
from
the
world
that
the
nine
orders
of
angels
may
glorify
thy
and
then
a
light
broke
out
of
the
air
and
wrapped
aodh
and
i
smelt
the
breath
of
roses
i
stirred
a
little
in
my
wonder
and
the
beggar
turned
and
saw
me
and
bending
low
said
brother
dove
if
i
have
done
wrong
forgive
me
and
i
will
do
penance
it
was
my
pity
moved
but
i
was
afraid
and
i
ran
away
and
did
not
stop
running
until
i
came
then
all
the
brothers
began
talking
together
one
saying
it
was
such
and
such
a
saint
and
one
that
it
was
not
he
but
another
and
one
that
it
was
none
of
these
for
they
were
still
in
their
brotherhoods
but
that
it
was
such
and
such
a
one
and
the
talk
was
as
near
to
quarreling
as
might
be
in
that
gentle
community
for
each
would
claim
so
great
a
saint
for
his
native
province
at
last
the
abbot
said
is
none
that
you
have
named
for
at
easter
i
had
greeting
from
all
and
each
was
in
his
brotherhood
but
he
is
aengus
the
lover
of
god
and
the
first
of
those
who
have
gone
to
live
in
the
wild
places
and
among
the
wild
beasts
ten
years
ago
he
felt
the
burden
of
many
labours
in
a
brotherhood
under
the
hill
of
patrick
and
went
into
the
forest
that
he
might
labour
only
with
song
to
the
lord
but
the
fame
of
his
holiness
brought
many
thousands
to
his
cell
so
that
a
little
pride
clung
to
a
soul
from
which
all
else
had
been
driven
nine
years
ago
he
dressed
himself
in
rags
and
from
that
day
none
has
seen
him
unless
indeed
it
be
true
that
he
has
been
seen
living
among
the
wolves
on
the
mountains
and
eating
the
grass
of
the
fields
let
us
go
to
him
and
bow
down
before
him
for
at
last
after
long
seeking
he
has
found
the
nothing
that
is
god
and
bid
him
lead
us
in
the
pathway
he
has
trodden
they
passed
in
their
white
habits
along
the
beaten
path
in
the
wood
the
acolytes
swinging
their
censers
before
them
and
the
abbot
with
his
crozier
studded
with
precious
stones
in
the
midst
of
the
incense
and
came
before
the
and
knelt
down
and
began
to
pray
awaiting
the
moment
when
the
child
would
wake
and
the
saint
cease
from
his
watch
and
come
to
look
at
the
sun
going
down
into
the
unknown
darkness
as
his
way
was
of
costello
the
proud
of
oona
the
daughter
of
dermott
and
of
the
bitter
tongue
costello
had
come
up
from
the
fields
and
lay
upon
the
ground
before
the
door
of
his
square
tower
resting
his
head
upon
his
hands
and
looking
at
the
sunset
and
considering
the
chances
of
the
weather
though
the
customs
of
elizabeth
and
james
now
going
out
of
fashion
in
england
had
begun
to
prevail
among
the
gentry
he
still
wore
the
great
cloak
of
the
native
irish
and
the
sensitive
outlines
of
his
face
and
the
greatness
of
his
indolent
body
had
a
commingling
of
pride
and
strength
which
belonged
to
a
simpler
age
his
eyes
wandered
from
the
sunset
to
where
the
long
white
road
lost
itself
over
the
horizon
and
to
a
horseman
who
toiled
slowly
up
the
hill
a
few
more
minutes
and
the
horseman
was
near
enough
for
his
little
and
shapeless
body
his
long
irish
cloak
and
the
dilapidated
bagpipes
hanging
from
his
shoulders
and
the
garron
under
him
to
be
seen
distinctly
in
the
grey
dusk
so
soon
as
he
had
come
within
earshot
he
began
crying
it
sleeping
you
are
tumaus
costello
when
better
men
break
their
hearts
on
the
great
white
roads
get
up
out
of
that
proud
tumaus
for
i
have
news
get
up
out
of
that
you
great
omadhaun
shake
yourself
out
of
the
earth
you
great
weed
of
a
man
costello
had
risen
to
his
feet
and
as
the
piper
came
up
to
him
seized
him
by
the
neck
of
his
jacket
and
lifting
him
out
of
his
saddle
threw
him
on
to
the
ground
me
alone
let
me
alone
said
the
other
but
costello
still
shook
him
have
news
from
daughter
the
great
fingers
were
loosened
and
the
piper
rose
gasping
did
you
not
tell
me
said
costello
you
came
from
her
you
might
have
railed
your
have
come
from
her
but
i
will
not
speak
unless
i
am
paid
for
my
costello
fumbled
at
the
bag
in
which
he
carried
his
money
and
it
was
some
time
before
it
would
open
for
the
hand
that
had
overcome
many
men
shook
with
fear
and
hope
is
all
the
money
in
my
bag
he
said
dropping
a
stream
of
french
and
spanish
money
into
the
hand
of
the
piper
who
bit
the
coins
before
he
would
answer
is
right
that
is
a
fair
price
but
i
will
not
speak
till
i
have
good
protection
for
if
the
dermotts
lay
their
hands
upon
me
in
any
boreen
after
sundown
or
in
by
day
i
will
be
left
to
rot
among
the
nettles
of
a
ditch
or
hung
on
the
great
sycamore
where
they
hung
the
last
beltaine
four
and
while
he
spoke
he
tied
the
reins
of
his
garron
to
a
bar
of
rusty
iron
that
was
mortared
into
the
wall
will
make
you
my
piper
and
my
said
costello
no
man
dare
lay
hands
upon
the
man
or
the
goat
or
the
horse
or
the
dog
that
is
tumaus
i
will
only
tell
my
message
said
the
other
flinging
the
saddle
on
the
ground
the
corner
of
the
chimney
with
a
noggin
in
my
hand
and
a
jug
of
the
brew
of
the
little
pot
beside
me
for
though
i
am
ragged
and
empty
my
forebears
were
well
clothed
and
full
until
their
house
was
burnt
and
their
cattle
harried
seven
centuries
ago
by
the
dillons
whom
i
shall
yet
see
on
the
hob
of
hell
and
they
and
while
he
spoke
the
little
eyes
gleamed
and
the
thin
hands
clenched
costello
led
him
into
the
great
hall
where
were
none
of
the
comforts
which
had
begun
to
grow
common
among
the
gentry
but
a
feudal
gauntness
and
bareness
and
pointed
to
the
bench
in
the
great
chimney
and
when
he
had
sat
down
filled
up
a
horn
noggin
and
set
it
on
the
bench
beside
him
and
set
a
great
black
jack
of
leather
beside
the
noggin
and
lit
a
torch
that
slanted
out
from
a
ring
in
the
wall
his
hands
trembling
the
while
and
then
turned
towards
him
and
said
daughter
come
to
me
duallach
son
of
daly
daughter
will
not
come
to
you
for
her
father
has
set
women
to
watch
her
but
she
bid
me
tell
you
that
this
day
sennight
will
be
the
eve
of
john
and
the
night
of
her
betrothal
to
namara
of
the
lake
and
she
would
have
you
there
that
when
they
bid
her
drink
to
him
she
loves
best
as
the
way
is
she
may
drink
to
you
tumaus
costello
and
let
all
know
where
her
heart
is
and
how
little
of
gladness
is
in
her
marriage
and
i
myself
bid
you
go
with
good
men
about
you
for
i
saw
the
with
my
own
eyes
and
they
dancing
the
in
the
and
then
he
held
the
now
empty
noggin
towards
costello
his
hand
closing
round
it
like
the
claw
of
a
bird
and
cried
my
noggin
again
for
i
would
the
day
had
come
when
all
the
water
in
the
world
is
to
shrink
into
a
that
i
might
drink
nothing
but
finding
that
costello
made
no
reply
but
sat
in
a
dream
he
burst
out
my
noggin
i
tell
you
for
no
costello
is
so
great
in
the
world
that
he
should
not
wait
upon
a
daly
even
though
the
daly
travel
the
road
with
his
pipes
and
the
costello
have
a
bare
hill
an
empty
house
a
horse
a
herd
of
goats
and
a
handful
of
the
dalys
if
you
will
said
costello
as
he
filled
the
noggin
you
have
brought
me
a
kind
word
from
my
for
the
next
few
days
duallach
went
hither
and
thither
trying
to
raise
a
bodyguard
and
every
man
he
met
had
some
story
of
costello
how
he
killed
the
wrestler
when
but
a
boy
by
so
straining
at
the
belt
that
went
about
them
both
that
he
broke
the
big
back
how
when
somewhat
older
he
dragged
fierce
horses
through
a
ford
in
the
unchion
for
a
wager
how
when
he
came
to
manhood
he
broke
the
steel
horseshoe
in
mayo
how
he
drove
many
men
before
him
through
rushy
meadow
at
because
of
a
malevolent
song
they
had
about
his
poverty
and
of
many
another
deed
of
his
strength
and
pride
but
he
could
find
none
who
would
trust
themselves
with
any
so
passionate
and
poor
in
a
quarrel
with
careful
and
wealthy
persons
like
dermott
of
the
sheep
and
namara
of
the
lake
then
costello
went
out
himself
and
after
listening
to
many
excuses
and
in
many
places
brought
in
a
big
fellow
who
followed
him
like
a
dog
a
who
worshipped
him
for
his
strength
a
fat
farmer
whose
forefathers
had
served
his
family
and
a
couple
of
lads
who
looked
after
his
goats
and
cows
and
marshalled
them
before
the
fire
in
the
empty
hall
they
had
brought
with
them
their
stout
cudgels
and
costello
gave
them
an
old
pistol
apiece
and
kept
them
all
night
drinking
spanish
ale
and
shooting
at
a
white
turnip
which
he
pinned
against
the
wall
with
a
skewer
duallach
of
the
pipes
sat
on
the
bench
in
the
chimney
playing
green
bunch
of
rushes
unchion
stream
and
princes
of
on
his
old
pipes
and
railing
now
at
the
appearance
of
the
shooters
now
at
their
clumsy
shooting
and
now
at
costello
because
he
had
no
better
servants
the
labourer
the
fellow
the
farmer
and
the
lads
were
all
well
accustomed
to
railing
for
it
was
as
inseparable
from
wake
or
wedding
as
the
squealing
of
his
pipes
but
they
wondered
at
the
forbearance
of
costello
who
seldom
came
either
to
wake
or
wedding
and
if
he
had
would
scarce
have
been
patient
with
a
scolding
piper
on
the
next
evening
they
set
out
for
costello
riding
a
tolerable
horse
and
carrying
a
sword
the
others
upon
garrons
and
with
their
stout
cudgels
under
their
arms
as
they
rode
over
the
bogs
and
in
the
boreens
among
the
hills
they
could
see
fire
answering
fire
from
hill
to
hill
from
horizon
to
horizon
and
everywhere
groups
who
danced
in
the
red
light
on
the
turf
celebrating
the
bridal
of
life
and
fire
when
they
came
to
house
they
saw
before
the
door
an
unusually
large
group
of
the
very
poor
dancing
about
a
fire
in
the
midst
of
which
was
a
blazing
cartwheel
that
circular
dance
which
is
so
ancient
that
the
gods
long
dwindled
to
be
but
fairies
dance
no
other
in
their
secret
places
from
the
door
and
through
the
long
on
either
side
came
the
pale
light
of
candles
and
the
sound
of
many
feet
dancing
a
dance
of
elizabeth
and
james
they
tied
their
horses
to
bushes
for
the
number
so
tied
already
showed
that
the
stables
were
full
and
shoved
their
way
through
a
crowd
of
peasants
who
stood
about
the
door
and
went
into
the
great
hall
where
the
dance
was
the
labourer
the
fellow
the
farmer
and
the
two
lads
mixed
with
a
group
of
servants
who
were
looking
on
from
an
alcove
and
duallach
sat
with
the
pipers
on
their
bench
but
costello
made
his
way
through
the
dancers
to
where
dermott
of
the
sheep
stood
with
namara
of
the
lake
pouring
poteen
out
of
a
porcelain
jug
into
horn
noggins
with
silver
rims
costello
said
the
old
man
have
done
a
good
deed
to
forget
what
has
been
and
to
fling
away
enmity
and
come
to
the
betrothal
of
my
daughter
to
namara
of
the
come
answered
costello
when
in
the
time
of
costello
de
angalo
my
forebears
overcame
your
forebears
and
afterwards
made
peace
a
compact
was
made
that
a
costello
might
go
with
his
and
his
piper
to
every
feast
given
by
a
dermott
for
ever
and
a
dermott
with
his
and
his
piper
to
every
feast
given
by
a
costello
for
you
come
with
evil
thoughts
and
armed
men
said
the
son
of
dermott
flushing
matter
how
strong
your
hands
to
wrestle
and
to
swing
the
sword
it
shall
go
badly
with
you
for
some
of
my
clan
have
come
out
of
mayo
and
my
three
brothers
and
their
servants
have
come
down
from
the
ox
and
while
he
spoke
he
kept
his
hand
inside
his
coat
as
though
upon
the
handle
of
a
weapon
answered
costello
but
come
to
dance
a
farewell
dance
with
your
dermott
drew
his
hand
out
of
his
coat
and
went
over
to
a
tall
pale
girl
who
was
now
standing
but
a
little
way
off
with
her
mild
eyes
fixed
upon
the
ground
has
come
to
dance
a
farewell
dance
for
he
knows
that
you
will
never
see
one
another
the
girl
lifted
her
eyes
and
gazed
at
costello
and
in
her
gaze
was
that
trust
of
the
humble
in
the
proud
the
gentle
in
the
violent
which
has
been
the
tragedy
of
woman
from
the
beginning
costello
led
her
among
the
dancers
and
they
were
soon
drawn
into
the
rhythm
of
the
pavane
that
stately
dance
which
with
the
saraband
the
gallead
and
the
morrice
dances
had
driven
out
among
all
but
the
most
irish
of
the
gentry
the
quicker
rhythms
of
the
pantomimic
dances
of
earlier
days
and
while
they
danced
there
came
over
them
the
unutterable
melancholy
the
weariness
with
the
world
the
poignant
and
bitter
pity
for
one
another
the
vague
anger
against
common
hopes
and
fears
which
is
the
exultation
of
love
and
when
a
dance
ended
and
the
pipers
laid
down
their
pipes
and
lifted
their
horn
noggins
they
stood
a
little
from
the
others
waiting
pensively
and
silently
for
the
dance
to
begin
again
and
the
fire
in
their
hearts
to
leap
up
and
to
wrap
them
anew
and
so
they
danced
and
danced
pavane
and
saraband
and
gallead
and
morrice
through
the
night
long
and
many
stood
still
to
watch
them
and
the
peasants
came
about
the
door
and
peered
in
as
though
they
understood
that
they
would
gather
their
children
about
them
long
hence
and
tell
how
they
had
seen
costello
dance
with
daughter
oona
and
become
by
the
telling
themselves
a
portion
of
ancient
romance
but
through
all
the
dancing
and
piping
namara
of
the
lake
went
hither
and
thither
talking
loudly
and
making
foolish
jokes
that
all
might
seem
well
with
him
and
old
dermott
of
the
sheep
grew
redder
and
redder
and
looked
oftener
and
oftener
at
the
doorway
to
see
if
the
candles
there
grew
yellow
in
the
dawn
at
last
he
saw
that
the
moment
to
end
had
come
and
in
a
pause
after
a
dance
cried
out
from
where
the
horn
noggins
stood
that
his
daughter
would
now
drink
the
cup
of
betrothal
then
oona
came
over
to
where
he
was
and
the
guests
stood
round
in
a
costello
close
to
the
wall
to
the
right
and
the
piper
the
labourer
the
farmer
the
man
and
the
two
farm
lads
close
behind
him
the
old
man
took
out
of
a
niche
in
the
wall
the
silver
cup
from
which
her
mother
and
her
mother
had
drunk
the
toasts
of
their
betrothals
and
poured
poteen
out
of
a
porcelain
jug
and
handed
the
cup
to
his
daughter
with
the
customary
words
to
him
whom
you
love
the
she
held
the
cup
to
her
lips
for
a
moment
and
then
said
in
a
clear
soft
voice
drink
to
my
true
love
tumaus
and
then
the
cup
rolled
over
and
over
on
the
ground
ringing
like
a
bell
for
the
old
man
had
struck
her
in
the
face
and
the
cup
had
fallen
and
there
was
a
deep
silence
there
were
many
of
people
among
the
servants
now
come
out
of
the
alcove
and
one
of
them
a
and
poet
a
last
remnant
of
the
bardic
order
who
had
a
chair
and
a
platter
in
kitchen
drew
a
french
knife
out
of
his
girdle
and
made
as
though
he
would
strike
at
costello
but
in
a
moment
a
blow
had
hurled
him
to
the
ground
his
shoulder
sending
the
cup
rolling
and
ringing
again
the
click
of
steel
had
followed
quickly
had
not
there
come
a
muttering
and
shouting
from
the
peasants
about
the
door
and
from
those
crowding
up
behind
them
and
all
knew
that
these
were
no
children
of
irish
or
friendly
namaras
and
dermotts
but
of
the
wild
irish
about
lough
gara
and
lough
cara
who
rowed
their
skin
coracles
and
had
masses
of
hair
over
their
eyes
and
left
the
right
arms
of
their
children
unchristened
that
they
might
give
the
stouter
blows
and
swore
only
by
atty
and
sun
and
moon
and
worshipped
beauty
and
strength
more
than
atty
or
sun
and
moon
hand
had
rested
upon
the
handle
of
his
sword
and
his
knuckles
had
grown
white
but
now
he
drew
it
away
and
followed
by
those
who
were
with
him
strode
towards
the
door
the
dancers
giving
way
before
him
the
most
angrily
and
slowly
and
with
glances
at
the
muttering
and
shouting
peasants
but
some
gladly
and
quickly
because
the
glory
of
his
fame
was
over
him
he
passed
through
the
fierce
and
friendly
peasant
faces
and
came
where
his
good
horse
and
the
garrons
were
tied
to
bushes
and
mounted
and
bade
his
ungainly
bodyguard
mount
also
and
ride
into
the
narrow
boreen
when
they
had
gone
a
little
way
duallach
who
rode
last
turned
towards
the
house
where
a
little
group
of
dermotts
and
namaras
stood
next
to
a
more
numerous
group
of
countrymen
and
cried
you
deserve
to
be
as
you
are
this
hour
a
lantern
without
a
candle
a
purse
without
a
penny
a
sheep
without
wool
for
your
hand
was
ever
niggardly
to
piper
and
fiddler
and
and
to
poor
travelling
he
had
not
done
before
the
three
old
dermotts
from
the
ox
mountains
had
run
towards
their
horses
and
old
dermott
himself
had
caught
the
bridle
of
a
garron
of
the
namaras
and
was
calling
to
the
others
to
follow
him
and
many
blows
and
many
deaths
had
been
had
not
the
countrymen
caught
up
still
glowing
sticks
from
the
ashes
of
the
fires
and
hurled
them
among
the
horses
with
loud
cries
making
all
plunge
and
rear
and
some
break
from
those
who
held
them
the
whites
of
their
eyes
gleaming
in
the
dawn
for
the
next
few
weeks
costello
had
no
lack
of
news
of
oona
for
now
a
woman
selling
eggs
or
fowls
and
now
a
man
or
a
woman
on
pilgrimage
to
the
well
of
the
rocks
would
tell
him
how
his
love
had
fallen
ill
the
day
after
eve
and
how
she
was
a
little
better
or
a
little
worse
as
it
might
be
and
though
he
looked
to
his
horses
and
his
cows
and
goats
as
usual
the
common
and
uncomely
the
dust
upon
the
roads
the
songs
of
men
returning
from
fairs
and
wakes
men
playing
cards
in
the
corners
of
fields
on
sundays
and
days
the
rumours
of
battles
and
changes
in
the
great
world
the
deliberate
purposes
of
those
about
him
troubled
him
with
an
inexplicable
trouble
and
the
country
people
still
remember
how
when
night
had
fallen
he
would
bid
duallach
of
the
pipes
tell
to
the
chirping
of
the
crickets
son
of
apple
beauty
of
the
world
king
of
son
or
some
other
of
those
traditional
tales
which
were
as
much
a
business
as
green
bunch
of
rushes
unchion
stream
or
chiefs
of
and
while
the
boundless
and
phantasmal
world
of
the
legends
was
would
abandon
himself
to
the
dreams
of
his
sorrow
duallach
would
often
pause
to
tell
how
some
clan
of
the
wild
irish
had
descended
from
an
incomparable
king
of
the
blue
belt
or
warrior
of
the
ozier
wattle
or
to
tell
with
many
curses
how
all
the
strangers
and
most
of
the
irish
were
the
seed
of
the
misshapen
and
horned
people
from
under
the
sea
or
of
the
servile
and
creeping
ferbolg
but
costello
cared
only
for
the
love
sorrows
and
no
matter
whither
the
stories
wandered
whether
to
the
isle
of
the
red
lough
where
the
blessed
are
or
to
the
malign
country
of
the
hag
of
the
east
oona
alone
endured
their
shadowy
hardships
for
it
was
she
and
no
daughter
of
old
who
was
hidden
in
the
steel
tower
under
the
water
with
the
folds
of
the
worm
of
nine
eyes
round
and
about
her
prison
and
it
was
she
who
won
by
seven
years
of
service
the
right
to
deliver
from
hell
all
she
could
carry
and
carried
away
multitudes
clinging
with
worn
fingers
to
the
hem
of
her
dress
and
it
was
she
who
endured
dumbness
for
a
year
because
of
the
little
thorn
of
enchantment
the
fairies
had
thrust
into
her
tongue
and
it
was
a
lock
of
her
hair
coiled
in
a
little
carved
box
which
gave
so
great
a
light
that
men
threshed
by
it
from
sundown
to
sunrise
and
awoke
so
great
a
wonder
that
kings
spent
years
in
wandering
or
fell
before
unknown
armies
in
seeking
to
discover
her
for
there
was
no
beauty
in
the
world
but
hers
no
tragedy
in
the
world
but
hers
and
when
at
last
the
voice
of
the
piper
grown
gentle
with
the
wisdom
of
old
romance
was
silent
and
his
rheumatic
steps
had
toiled
upstairs
and
to
bed
and
costello
had
dipped
his
fingers
into
the
little
delf
font
of
holy
water
and
begun
to
pray
to
mary
of
the
seven
sorrows
the
blue
eyes
and
dress
of
the
painting
in
the
chapel
faded
from
his
imagination
and
the
brown
eyes
and
homespun
dress
of
daughter
winny
came
in
their
stead
for
there
was
no
tenderness
in
the
world
but
hers
he
was
of
those
ascetics
of
passion
who
keep
their
hearts
pure
for
love
or
for
hatred
as
other
men
for
god
for
mary
and
for
the
saints
and
who
when
the
hour
of
their
visitation
arrives
come
to
the
divine
essence
by
the
bitter
tumult
the
garden
of
gethsemane
and
the
desolate
rood
ordained
for
immortal
passions
in
mortal
hearts
one
day
a
rode
up
to
costello
who
was
helping
his
two
lads
to
reap
a
meadow
and
gave
him
a
letter
and
rode
away
without
a
word
and
the
letter
contained
these
words
in
english
costello
my
daughter
is
very
ill
the
wise
woman
from
has
seen
her
and
says
she
will
die
unless
you
come
to
her
i
therefore
bid
you
come
to
her
whose
peace
you
stole
by
the
son
of
costello
threw
down
his
scythe
and
sent
one
of
the
lads
for
duallach
who
had
become
woven
into
his
mind
with
oona
and
himself
saddled
his
great
horse
and
garron
when
they
came
to
house
it
was
late
afternoon
and
lough
gara
lay
down
below
them
blue
and
deserted
and
though
they
had
seen
when
at
a
distance
dark
figures
moving
about
the
door
the
house
appeared
not
less
deserted
than
the
lough
the
door
stood
half
open
and
costello
knocked
upon
it
again
and
again
so
that
a
number
of
lake
gulls
flew
up
out
of
the
grass
and
circled
screaming
over
his
head
but
there
was
no
answer
is
no
one
here
said
duallach
dermott
of
the
sheep
is
too
proud
to
welcome
costello
the
proud
and
he
threw
the
door
open
and
they
saw
a
ragged
dirty
very
old
woman
who
sat
upon
the
floor
leaning
against
the
wall
costello
knew
that
it
was
bridget
delaney
a
deaf
and
dumb
beggar
and
she
when
she
saw
him
stood
up
and
made
a
sign
to
him
to
follow
and
led
him
and
his
companion
up
a
stair
and
down
a
long
corridor
to
a
closed
door
she
pushed
the
door
open
and
went
a
little
way
off
and
sat
down
as
before
duallach
sat
upon
the
ground
also
but
close
to
the
door
and
costello
went
and
gazed
upon
winny
sleeping
upon
a
bed
he
sat
upon
a
chair
beside
her
and
waited
and
a
long
time
passed
and
still
she
slept
on
and
then
duallach
motioned
to
him
through
the
door
to
wake
her
but
he
hushed
his
very
breath
that
she
might
sleep
on
for
his
heart
was
full
of
that
ungovernable
pity
which
makes
the
fading
heart
of
the
lover
a
shadow
of
the
divine
heart
presently
he
turned
to
duallach
and
said
is
not
right
that
i
stay
here
where
there
are
none
of
her
kindred
for
the
common
people
are
always
ready
to
blame
the
and
then
they
went
down
and
stood
at
the
door
of
the
house
and
waited
but
the
evening
wore
on
and
no
one
came
was
a
foolish
man
that
called
you
proud
costello
duallach
cried
at
last
he
seen
you
waiting
and
waiting
where
they
left
none
but
a
beggar
to
welcome
you
it
is
humble
costello
he
would
have
called
then
costello
mounted
and
duallach
mounted
but
when
they
had
ridden
a
little
way
costello
tightened
the
reins
and
made
his
horse
stand
still
many
minutes
passed
and
then
duallach
cried
is
no
wonder
that
you
fear
to
offend
dermott
of
the
sheep
for
he
has
many
brothers
and
friends
and
though
he
is
old
he
is
a
strong
man
and
ready
with
his
hands
and
he
is
of
the
irish
and
the
enemies
of
the
gael
are
upon
his
and
costello
answered
flushing
and
looking
towards
the
house
swear
by
the
mother
of
god
that
i
will
never
return
there
again
if
they
do
not
send
after
me
before
i
pass
the
ford
in
the
brown
river
and
he
rode
on
but
so
very
slowly
that
the
sun
went
down
and
the
bats
began
to
fly
over
the
bogs
when
he
came
to
the
river
he
lingered
awhile
upon
the
bank
among
the
flowers
of
the
flag
but
presently
rode
out
into
the
middle
and
stopped
his
horse
in
a
foaming
shallow
duallach
however
crossed
over
and
waited
on
a
further
bank
above
a
deeper
place
after
a
good
while
duallach
cried
out
again
and
this
time
very
bitterly
was
a
fool
who
begot
you
and
a
fool
who
bore
you
and
they
are
fools
of
all
fools
who
say
you
come
of
an
old
and
noble
stock
for
you
come
of
beggars
who
travelled
from
door
to
door
bowing
to
gentles
and
to
with
bent
head
costello
rode
through
the
river
and
stood
beside
him
and
would
have
spoken
had
not
hoofs
clattered
on
the
further
bank
and
a
horseman
splashed
towards
them
it
was
a
of
and
he
said
speaking
breathlessly
like
one
who
had
ridden
hard
costello
i
come
to
bid
you
again
to
house
when
you
had
gone
his
daughter
winny
awoke
and
called
your
name
for
you
had
been
in
her
dreams
bridget
delaney
the
dummy
saw
her
lips
move
and
the
trouble
upon
her
and
came
where
we
were
hiding
in
the
wood
above
the
house
and
took
dermott
of
the
sheep
by
the
coat
and
brought
him
to
his
daughter
he
saw
the
trouble
upon
her
and
bid
me
ride
his
own
horse
to
bring
you
the
then
costello
turned
towards
the
piper
duallach
daly
and
taking
him
about
the
waist
lifted
him
out
of
the
saddle
and
hurled
him
against
a
grey
rock
that
rose
up
out
of
the
river
so
that
he
fell
lifeless
into
the
deep
place
and
the
waters
swept
over
the
tongue
which
god
had
made
bitter
that
there
might
be
a
story
in
ears
in
after
time
then
plunging
his
spurs
into
the
horse
he
rode
away
furiously
toward
the
along
the
edge
of
the
river
and
did
not
pause
until
he
came
to
another
and
smoother
ford
and
saw
the
rising
moon
mirrored
in
the
water
he
paused
for
a
moment
irresolute
and
then
rode
into
the
ford
and
on
over
the
ox
mountains
and
down
towards
the
sea
his
eyes
almost
continually
resting
upon
the
moon
which
glimmered
in
the
dimness
like
a
great
white
rose
hung
on
the
lattice
of
some
boundless
and
phantasmal
world
but
now
his
horse
long
dark
with
sweat
and
breathing
hard
for
he
kept
spurring
it
to
an
extreme
speed
fell
heavily
hurling
him
into
the
grass
at
the
he
tried
to
make
it
stand
up
and
failing
in
this
went
on
alone
towards
the
moonlight
and
came
to
the
sea
and
saw
a
schooner
lying
there
at
anchor
now
that
he
could
go
no
further
because
of
the
sea
he
found
that
he
was
very
tired
and
the
night
very
cold
and
went
into
a
shebeen
close
to
the
shore
and
threw
himself
down
upon
a
bench
the
room
was
full
of
spanish
and
irish
sailors
who
had
just
smuggled
a
cargo
of
wine
and
ale
and
were
waiting
a
favourable
wind
to
set
out
again
a
spaniard
offered
him
a
drink
in
bad
gaelic
he
drank
it
greedily
and
began
talking
wildly
and
rapidly
for
some
three
weeks
the
wind
blew
inshore
or
with
too
great
violence
and
the
sailors
stayed
drinking
and
talking
and
playing
cards
and
costello
stayed
with
them
sleeping
upon
a
bench
in
the
shebeen
and
drinking
and
talking
and
playing
more
than
any
he
soon
lost
what
little
money
he
had
and
then
his
horse
which
some
one
had
brought
from
the
mountain
boreen
to
a
spaniard
who
sold
it
to
a
farmer
from
the
mountains
and
then
his
long
cloak
and
his
spurs
and
his
boots
of
soft
leather
at
last
a
gentle
wind
blew
towards
spain
and
the
crew
rowed
out
to
their
schooner
singing
gaelic
and
spanish
songs
and
lifted
the
anchor
and
in
a
little
while
the
white
sails
had
dropped
under
the
horizon
then
costello
turned
homeward
his
life
gaping
before
him
and
walked
all
day
coming
in
the
early
evening
to
the
road
that
went
from
near
lough
gara
to
the
southern
edge
of
lough
cay
here
he
overtook
a
great
crowd
of
peasants
and
farmers
who
were
walking
very
slowly
after
two
priests
and
a
group
of
persons
certain
of
whom
were
carrying
a
coffin
he
stopped
an
old
man
and
asked
whose
burying
it
was
and
whose
people
they
were
and
the
old
man
answered
is
the
burying
of
oona
daughter
and
we
are
the
namaras
and
the
dermotts
and
their
following
and
you
are
tumaus
costello
who
murdered
costello
went
on
towards
the
head
of
the
procession
passing
men
who
looked
at
him
with
fierce
eyes
and
only
vaguely
understanding
what
he
had
heard
for
now
that
he
had
lost
the
understanding
that
belongs
to
good
health
it
seemed
impossible
that
a
gentleness
and
a
beauty
which
had
been
so
long
the
heart
could
pass
away
presently
he
stopped
and
asked
again
whose
burying
it
was
and
a
man
answered
are
carrying
daughter
winny
whom
you
murdered
to
be
buried
in
the
island
of
the
holy
trinity
and
the
man
stooped
and
picked
up
a
stone
and
cast
it
at
costello
striking
him
on
the
cheek
and
making
the
blood
flow
out
over
his
face
costello
went
on
scarcely
feeling
the
blow
and
coming
to
those
about
the
coffin
shouldered
his
way
into
the
midst
of
them
and
laying
his
hand
upon
the
coffin
asked
in
a
loud
voice
is
in
this
coffin
the
three
old
dermotts
from
the
ox
mountains
caught
up
stones
and
bid
those
about
them
do
the
same
and
he
was
driven
from
the
road
covered
with
wounds
and
but
for
the
priests
would
surely
have
been
killed
when
the
procession
had
passed
on
costello
began
to
follow
again
and
saw
from
a
distance
the
coffin
laid
upon
a
large
boat
and
those
about
it
get
into
other
boats
and
the
boats
move
slowly
over
the
water
to
insula
trinitatis
and
after
a
time
he
saw
the
boats
return
and
their
passengers
mingle
with
the
crowd
upon
the
bank
and
all
disperse
by
many
roads
and
boreens
it
seemed
to
him
that
winny
was
somewhere
on
the
island
smiling
gently
as
of
old
and
when
all
had
gone
he
swam
in
the
way
the
boats
had
been
rowed
and
found
the
grave
beside
the
ruined
abbey
of
the
holy
trinity
and
threw
himself
upon
it
calling
to
oona
to
come
to
him
above
him
the
square
ivy
leaves
trembled
and
all
about
him
white
moths
moved
over
white
flowers
and
sweet
odours
drifted
through
the
dim
air
he
lay
there
all
that
night
and
through
the
day
after
from
time
to
time
calling
her
to
come
to
him
but
when
the
third
night
came
he
had
forgotten
worn
out
with
hunger
and
sorrow
that
her
body
lay
in
the
earth
beneath
but
only
knew
she
was
somewhere
near
and
would
not
come
to
him
just
before
dawn
the
hour
when
the
peasants
hear
his
ghostly
voice
crying
out
his
pride
awoke
and
he
called
loudly
daughter
of
dermott
of
the
sheep
if
you
do
not
come
to
me
i
will
go
and
never
return
to
the
island
of
the
holy
trinity
and
before
his
voice
had
died
away
a
cold
and
whirling
wind
had
swept
over
the
island
and
he
saw
many
figures
rushing
past
women
of
the
sidhe
with
crowns
of
silver
and
dim
floating
drapery
and
then
oona
but
no
longer
smiling
gently
for
she
passed
him
swiftly
and
angrily
and
as
she
passed
struck
him
upon
the
face
crying
go
and
never
he
would
have
followed
and
was
calling
out
her
name
when
the
whole
glimmering
company
rose
up
into
the
air
and
rushing
together
in
the
shape
of
a
great
silvery
rose
faded
into
the
ashen
dawn
costello
got
up
from
the
grave
understanding
nothing
but
that
he
had
made
his
beloved
angry
and
that
she
wished
him
to
go
and
wading
out
into
the
lake
began
to
swim
he
swam
on
and
on
but
his
limbs
were
too
weary
to
keep
him
afloat
and
her
anger
was
heavy
about
him
and
when
he
had
gone
a
little
way
he
sank
without
a
struggle
like
a
man
passing
into
sleep
and
dreams
the
next
day
a
poor
fisherman
found
him
among
the
reeds
upon
the
lake
shore
lying
upon
the
white
lake
sand
with
his
arms
flung
out
as
though
he
lay
upon
a
rood
and
carried
him
to
his
own
house
and
the
very
poor
lamented
over
him
and
sang
the
keen
and
when
the
time
had
come
laid
him
in
the
abbey
on
insula
trinitatis
with
only
the
ruined
altar
between
him
and
daughter
and
planted
above
them
two
that
in
after
days
wove
their
branches
together
and
mingled
their
trembling
leaves
rosa
alchemica
o
blessed
and
happy
he
who
knowing
the
mysteries
of
the
gods
sanctifies
his
life
and
purifies
his
soul
celebrating
orgies
in
the
mountains
with
holy
rosa
alchemica
i
it
is
now
more
than
ten
years
since
i
met
for
the
last
time
michael
robartes
and
for
the
first
time
and
the
last
time
his
friends
and
fellow
students
and
witnessed
his
and
their
tragic
end
and
endured
those
strange
experiences
which
have
changed
me
so
that
my
writings
have
grown
less
popular
and
less
intelligible
and
driven
me
almost
to
the
verge
of
taking
the
habit
of
dominic
i
had
just
published
a
little
work
on
the
alchemists
somewhat
in
the
manner
of
sir
thomas
browne
and
had
received
many
letters
from
believers
in
the
arcane
sciences
upbraiding
what
they
called
my
timidity
for
they
could
not
believe
so
evident
sympathy
but
the
sympathy
of
the
artist
which
is
half
pity
for
everything
which
has
moved
hearts
in
any
age
i
had
discovered
early
in
my
researches
that
their
doctrine
was
no
merely
chemical
phantasy
but
a
philosophy
they
applied
to
the
world
to
the
elements
and
to
man
himself
and
that
they
sought
to
fashion
gold
out
of
common
metals
merely
as
part
of
an
universal
transmutation
of
all
things
into
some
divine
and
imperishable
substance
and
this
enabled
me
to
make
my
little
book
a
fanciful
reverie
over
the
transmutation
of
life
into
art
and
a
cry
of
measureless
desire
for
a
world
made
wholly
of
essences
i
was
sitting
dreaming
of
what
i
had
written
in
my
house
in
one
of
the
old
parts
of
dublin
a
house
my
ancestors
had
made
almost
famous
through
their
part
in
the
politics
of
the
city
and
their
friendships
with
the
famous
men
of
their
generations
and
was
feeling
an
unwonted
happiness
at
having
at
last
accomplished
a
design
and
made
my
rooms
an
expression
of
this
favourite
doctrine
the
portraits
of
more
historical
than
artistic
interest
had
gone
and
tapestry
full
of
the
blue
and
bronze
of
peacocks
fell
over
the
doors
and
shut
out
all
history
and
activity
untouched
with
beauty
and
peace
and
now
when
i
looked
at
my
crevelli
and
pondered
on
the
rose
in
the
hand
of
the
virgin
wherein
the
form
was
so
delicate
and
precise
that
it
seemed
more
like
a
thought
than
a
flower
or
at
the
grey
dawn
and
rapturous
faces
of
my
francesca
i
knew
all
a
ecstasy
without
his
slavery
to
rule
and
custom
when
i
pondered
over
the
antique
bronze
gods
and
goddesses
which
i
had
mortgaged
my
house
to
buy
i
had
all
a
delight
in
various
beauty
and
without
his
terror
at
sleepless
destiny
and
his
labour
with
many
sacrifices
and
i
had
only
to
go
to
my
bookshelf
where
every
book
was
bound
in
leather
stamped
with
intricate
ornament
and
of
a
carefully
chosen
colour
shakespeare
in
the
orange
of
the
glory
of
the
world
dante
in
the
dull
red
of
his
anger
milton
in
the
blue
grey
of
his
formal
calm
and
i
could
experience
what
i
would
of
human
passions
without
their
bitterness
and
without
satiety
i
had
gathered
about
me
all
gods
because
i
believed
in
none
and
experienced
every
pleasure
because
i
gave
myself
to
none
but
held
myself
apart
individual
indissoluble
a
mirror
of
polished
steel
i
looked
in
the
triumph
of
this
imagination
at
the
birds
of
hera
glowing
in
the
firelight
as
though
they
were
wrought
of
jewels
and
to
my
mind
for
which
symbolism
was
a
necessity
they
seemed
the
doorkeepers
of
my
world
shutting
out
all
that
was
not
of
as
affluent
a
beauty
as
their
own
and
for
a
moment
i
thought
as
i
had
thought
in
so
many
other
moments
that
it
was
possible
to
rob
life
of
every
bitterness
except
the
bitterness
of
death
and
then
a
thought
which
had
followed
this
thought
time
after
time
filled
me
with
a
passionate
sorrow
all
those
forms
that
madonna
with
her
brooding
purity
those
rapturous
faces
singing
in
the
morning
light
those
bronze
divinities
with
their
passionless
dignity
those
wild
shapes
rushing
from
despair
to
despair
belonged
to
a
divine
world
wherein
i
had
no
part
and
every
experience
however
profound
every
perception
however
exquisite
would
bring
me
the
bitter
dream
of
a
limitless
energy
i
could
never
know
and
even
in
my
most
perfect
moment
i
would
be
two
selves
the
one
watching
with
heavy
eyes
the
moment
of
content
i
had
heaped
about
me
the
gold
born
in
the
crucibles
of
others
but
the
supreme
dream
of
the
alchemist
the
transmutation
of
the
weary
heart
into
a
weariless
spirit
was
as
far
from
me
as
i
doubted
not
it
had
been
from
him
also
i
turned
to
my
last
purchase
a
set
of
alchemical
apparatus
which
the
dealer
in
the
rue
le
peletier
had
assured
me
once
belonged
to
raymond
lully
and
as
i
joined
the
to
the
and
laid
the
at
their
side
i
understood
the
alchemical
doctrine
that
all
beings
divided
from
the
great
deep
where
spirits
wander
one
and
yet
a
multitude
are
weary
and
sympathized
in
the
pride
of
my
connoisseurship
with
the
consuming
thirst
for
destruction
which
made
the
alchemist
veil
under
his
symbols
of
lions
and
dragons
of
eagles
and
ravens
of
dew
and
of
nitre
a
search
for
an
essence
which
would
dissolve
all
mortal
things
i
repeated
to
myself
the
ninth
key
of
basilius
valentinus
in
which
he
compares
the
fire
of
the
last
day
to
the
fire
of
the
alchemist
and
the
world
to
the
furnace
and
would
have
us
know
that
all
must
be
dissolved
before
the
divine
substance
material
gold
or
immaterial
ecstasy
awake
i
had
dissolved
indeed
the
mortal
world
and
lived
amid
immortal
essences
but
had
obtained
no
miraculous
ecstasy
as
i
thought
of
these
things
i
drew
aside
the
curtains
and
looked
out
into
the
darkness
and
it
seemed
to
my
troubled
fancy
that
all
those
little
points
of
light
filling
the
sky
were
the
furnaces
of
innumerable
divine
alchemists
who
labour
continually
turning
lead
into
gold
weariness
into
ecstasy
bodies
into
souls
the
darkness
into
god
and
at
their
perfect
labour
my
mortality
grew
heavy
and
i
cried
out
as
so
many
dreamers
and
men
of
letters
in
our
age
have
cried
for
the
birth
of
that
elaborate
spiritual
beauty
which
could
alone
uplift
souls
weighted
with
so
many
dreams
ii
my
reverie
was
broken
by
a
loud
knocking
at
the
door
and
i
wondered
the
more
at
this
because
i
had
no
visitors
and
had
bid
my
servants
do
all
things
silently
lest
they
broke
the
dream
of
my
inner
life
feeling
a
little
curious
i
resolved
to
go
to
the
door
myself
and
taking
one
of
the
silver
candlesticks
from
the
mantlepiece
began
to
descend
the
stairs
the
servants
appeared
to
be
out
for
though
the
sound
poured
through
every
corner
and
crevice
of
the
house
there
was
no
stir
in
the
lower
rooms
i
remembered
that
because
my
needs
were
so
few
my
part
in
life
so
little
they
had
begun
to
come
and
go
as
they
would
often
leaving
me
alone
for
hours
the
emptiness
and
silence
of
a
world
from
which
i
had
driven
everything
but
dreams
suddenly
overwhelmed
me
and
i
shuddered
as
i
drew
the
bolt
i
found
before
me
michael
robartes
whom
i
had
not
seen
for
years
and
whose
wild
red
hair
fierce
eyes
sensitive
tremulous
lips
and
rough
clothes
made
him
look
now
just
as
they
used
to
do
fifteen
years
before
something
between
a
debauchee
a
saint
and
a
peasant
he
had
recently
come
to
ireland
he
said
and
wished
to
see
me
on
a
matter
of
importance
indeed
the
only
matter
of
importance
for
him
and
for
me
his
voice
brought
up
before
me
our
student
years
in
paris
and
remembering
the
magnetic
power
he
had
once
possessed
over
me
a
little
fear
mingled
with
much
annoyance
at
this
irrelevant
intrusion
as
i
led
the
way
up
the
wide
staircase
where
swift
had
passed
joking
and
railing
and
curran
telling
stories
and
quoting
greek
in
simpler
days
before
minds
subtilized
and
complicated
by
the
romantic
movement
in
art
and
literature
began
to
tremble
on
the
verge
of
some
unimagined
revelation
i
felt
that
my
hand
shook
and
saw
that
the
light
of
the
candle
wavered
and
quivered
more
than
it
need
have
upon
the
mænads
on
the
old
french
panels
making
them
look
like
the
first
beings
slowly
shaping
in
the
formless
and
void
darkness
when
the
door
had
closed
and
the
peacock
curtain
glimmering
like
flame
fell
between
us
and
the
world
i
felt
in
a
way
i
could
not
understand
that
some
singular
and
unexpected
thing
was
about
to
happen
i
went
over
to
the
mantlepiece
and
finding
that
a
little
chainless
bronze
censer
set
upon
the
outside
with
pieces
of
painted
china
by
orazio
fontana
which
i
had
filled
with
antique
amulets
had
fallen
upon
its
side
and
poured
out
its
contents
i
began
to
gather
the
amulets
into
the
bowl
partly
to
collect
my
thoughts
and
partly
with
that
habitual
reverence
which
seemed
to
me
the
due
of
things
so
long
connected
with
secret
hopes
and
fears
see
said
michael
robartes
you
are
still
fond
of
incense
and
i
can
show
you
an
incense
more
precious
than
any
you
have
ever
seen
and
as
he
spoke
he
took
the
censer
out
of
my
hand
and
put
the
amulets
in
a
little
heap
between
the
and
the
i
sat
down
and
he
sat
down
at
the
side
of
the
fire
and
sat
there
for
awhile
looking
into
the
fire
and
holding
the
censer
in
his
hand
have
come
to
ask
you
something
he
said
the
incense
will
fill
the
room
and
our
thoughts
with
its
sweet
odour
while
we
are
talking
i
got
it
from
an
old
man
in
syria
who
said
it
was
made
from
flowers
of
one
kind
with
the
flowers
that
laid
their
heavy
purple
petals
upon
the
hands
and
upon
the
hair
and
upon
the
feet
of
christ
in
the
garden
of
gethsemane
and
folded
him
in
their
heavy
breath
until
he
cried
against
the
cross
and
his
he
shook
some
dust
into
the
censer
out
of
a
small
silk
bag
and
set
the
censer
upon
the
floor
and
lit
the
dust
which
sent
up
a
blue
stream
of
smoke
that
spread
out
over
the
ceiling
and
flowed
downwards
again
until
it
was
like
banyan
tree
it
filled
me
as
incense
often
does
with
a
faint
sleepiness
so
that
i
started
when
he
said
have
come
to
ask
you
that
question
which
i
asked
you
in
paris
and
which
you
left
paris
rather
than
he
had
turned
his
eyes
towards
me
and
i
saw
them
glitter
in
the
firelight
and
through
the
incense
as
i
replied
mean
will
i
become
an
initiate
of
your
order
of
the
alchemical
rose
i
would
not
consent
in
paris
when
i
was
full
of
unsatisfied
desire
and
now
that
i
have
at
last
fashioned
my
life
according
to
my
desire
am
i
likely
to
consent
have
changed
greatly
since
then
he
answered
have
read
your
books
and
now
i
see
you
among
all
these
images
and
i
understand
you
better
than
you
do
yourself
for
i
have
been
with
many
and
many
dreamers
at
the
same
you
have
shut
away
the
world
and
gathered
the
gods
about
you
and
if
you
do
not
throw
yourself
at
their
feet
you
will
be
always
full
of
lassitude
and
of
wavering
purpose
for
a
man
must
forget
he
is
miserable
in
the
bustle
and
noise
of
the
multitude
in
this
world
and
in
time
or
seek
a
mystical
union
with
the
multitude
who
govern
this
world
and
and
then
he
murmured
something
i
could
not
hear
and
as
though
to
someone
i
could
not
see
for
a
moment
the
room
appeared
to
darken
as
it
used
to
do
when
he
was
about
to
perform
some
singular
experiment
and
in
the
darkness
the
peacocks
upon
the
doors
seemed
to
glow
with
a
more
intense
colour
i
cast
off
the
illusion
which
was
i
believe
merely
caused
by
memory
and
by
the
twilight
of
incense
for
i
would
not
acknowledge
that
he
could
overcome
my
now
mature
intellect
and
i
said
if
i
grant
that
i
need
a
spiritual
belief
and
some
form
of
worship
why
should
i
go
to
eleusis
and
not
to
calvary
he
leaned
forward
and
began
speaking
with
a
slightly
rhythmical
intonation
and
as
he
spoke
i
had
to
struggle
again
with
the
shadow
as
of
some
older
night
than
the
night
of
the
sun
which
began
to
dim
the
light
of
the
candles
and
to
blot
out
the
little
gleams
upon
the
corner
of
and
on
the
bronze
divinities
and
to
turn
the
blue
of
the
incense
to
a
heavy
purple
while
it
left
the
peacocks
to
glimmer
and
glow
as
though
each
separate
colour
were
a
living
spirit
i
had
fallen
into
a
profound
reverie
in
which
i
heard
him
speaking
as
at
a
distance
yet
there
is
no
one
who
communes
with
only
one
god
he
was
saying
the
more
a
man
lives
in
imagination
and
in
a
refined
understanding
the
more
gods
does
he
meet
with
and
talk
with
and
the
more
does
he
come
under
the
power
of
roland
who
sounded
in
the
valley
of
roncesvalles
the
last
trumpet
of
the
will
and
pleasure
and
of
hamlet
who
saw
them
perishing
away
and
sighed
and
of
faust
who
looked
for
them
up
and
down
the
world
and
could
not
find
them
and
under
the
power
of
all
those
countless
divinities
who
have
taken
upon
themselves
spiritual
bodies
in
the
minds
of
the
modern
poets
and
romance
writers
and
under
the
power
of
the
old
divinities
who
since
the
renaissance
have
won
everything
of
their
ancient
worship
except
the
sacrifice
of
birds
and
fishes
the
fragrance
of
garlands
and
the
smoke
of
incense
the
many
think
humanity
made
these
divinities
and
that
it
can
unmake
them
again
but
we
who
have
seen
them
pass
in
rattling
harness
and
in
soft
robes
and
heard
them
speak
with
articulate
voices
while
we
lay
in
deathlike
trance
know
that
they
are
always
making
and
unmaking
humanity
which
is
indeed
but
the
trembling
of
their
he
had
stood
up
and
begun
to
walk
to
and
fro
and
had
become
in
my
waking
dream
a
shuttle
weaving
an
immense
purple
web
whose
folds
had
begun
to
fill
the
room
the
room
seemed
to
have
become
inexplicably
silent
as
though
all
but
the
web
and
the
weaving
were
at
an
end
in
the
world
have
come
to
us
they
have
come
to
us
the
voice
began
again
that
have
ever
been
in
your
reverie
all
that
you
have
met
with
in
books
there
is
lear
his
head
still
wet
with
the
and
he
laughs
because
you
thought
yourself
an
existence
who
are
but
a
shadow
and
him
a
shadow
who
is
an
eternal
god
and
there
is
beatrice
with
her
lips
half
parted
in
a
smile
as
though
all
the
stars
were
about
to
pass
away
in
a
sigh
of
love
and
there
is
the
mother
of
the
god
of
humility
who
cast
so
great
a
spell
over
men
that
they
have
tried
to
unpeople
their
hearts
that
he
might
reign
alone
but
she
holds
in
her
hand
the
rose
whose
every
petal
is
a
god
and
there
o
swiftly
she
comes
is
aphrodite
under
a
twilight
falling
from
the
wings
of
numberless
sparrows
and
about
her
feet
are
the
grey
and
white
in
the
midst
of
my
dream
i
saw
him
hold
out
his
left
arm
and
pass
his
right
hand
over
it
as
though
he
stroked
the
wings
of
doves
i
made
a
violent
effort
which
seemed
almost
to
tear
me
in
two
and
said
with
forced
determination
would
sweep
me
away
into
an
indefinite
world
which
fills
me
with
terror
and
yet
a
man
is
a
great
man
just
in
so
far
as
he
can
make
his
mind
reflect
everything
with
indifferent
precision
like
a
i
seemed
to
be
perfectly
master
of
myself
and
went
on
but
more
rapidly
command
you
to
leave
me
at
once
for
your
ideas
and
phantasies
are
but
the
illusions
that
creep
like
maggots
into
civilizations
when
they
begin
to
decline
and
into
minds
when
they
begin
to
i
had
grown
suddenly
angry
and
seizing
the
from
the
table
was
about
to
rise
and
strike
him
with
it
when
the
peacocks
on
the
door
behind
him
appeared
to
grow
immense
and
then
the
fell
from
my
fingers
and
i
was
drowned
in
a
tide
of
green
and
blue
and
bronze
feathers
and
as
i
struggled
hopelessly
i
heard
a
distant
voice
saying
master
avicenna
has
written
that
all
life
proceeds
out
of
the
glittering
feathers
had
now
covered
me
completely
and
i
knew
that
i
had
struggled
for
hundreds
of
years
and
was
conquered
at
last
i
was
sinking
into
the
depth
when
the
green
and
blue
and
bronze
that
seemed
to
fill
the
world
became
a
sea
of
flame
and
swept
me
away
and
as
i
was
swirled
along
i
heard
a
voice
over
my
head
cry
mirror
is
broken
in
two
pieces
and
another
voice
answer
mirror
is
broken
in
four
pieces
and
a
more
distant
voice
cry
with
an
exultant
cry
mirror
is
broken
into
numberless
and
then
a
multitude
of
pale
hands
were
reaching
towards
me
and
strange
gentle
faces
bending
above
me
and
half
wailing
and
half
caressing
voices
uttering
words
that
were
forgotten
the
moment
they
were
spoken
i
was
being
lifted
out
of
the
tide
of
flame
and
felt
my
memories
my
hopes
my
thoughts
my
will
everything
i
held
to
be
myself
melting
away
then
i
seemed
to
rise
through
numberless
companies
of
beings
who
were
i
understood
in
some
way
more
certain
than
thought
each
wrapped
in
his
eternal
moment
in
the
perfect
lifting
of
an
arm
in
a
little
circlet
of
rhythmical
words
in
dreaming
with
dim
eyes
and
eyelids
and
then
i
passed
beyond
these
forms
which
were
so
beautiful
they
had
almost
ceased
to
be
and
having
endured
strange
moods
melancholy
as
it
seemed
with
the
weight
of
many
worlds
i
passed
into
that
death
which
is
beauty
herself
and
into
that
loneliness
which
all
the
multitudes
desire
without
ceasing
all
things
that
had
ever
lived
seemed
to
come
and
dwell
in
my
heart
and
i
in
theirs
and
i
had
never
again
known
mortality
or
tears
had
i
not
suddenly
fallen
from
the
certainty
of
vision
into
the
uncertainty
of
dream
and
become
a
drop
of
molten
gold
falling
with
immense
rapidity
through
a
night
elaborate
with
stars
and
all
about
me
a
melancholy
exultant
wailing
i
fell
and
fell
and
fell
and
then
the
wailing
was
but
the
wailing
of
the
wind
in
the
chimney
and
i
awoke
to
find
myself
leaning
upon
the
table
and
supporting
my
head
with
my
hands
i
saw
the
swaying
from
side
to
side
in
the
distant
corner
it
had
rolled
to
and
michael
robartes
watching
me
and
waiting
will
go
wherever
you
will
i
said
do
whatever
you
bid
me
for
i
have
been
with
eternal
knew
he
replied
must
need
answer
as
you
have
answered
when
i
heard
the
storm
begin
you
must
come
to
a
great
distance
for
we
were
commanded
to
build
our
temple
between
the
pure
multitude
by
the
waves
and
the
impure
multitude
of
iii
i
did
not
speak
as
we
drove
through
the
deserted
streets
for
my
mind
was
curiously
empty
of
familiar
thoughts
and
experiences
it
seemed
to
have
been
plucked
out
of
the
definite
world
and
cast
naked
upon
a
shoreless
sea
there
were
moments
when
the
vision
appeared
on
the
point
of
returning
and
i
would
with
an
ecstasy
of
joy
or
sorrow
crimes
and
heroisms
fortunes
and
misfortunes
or
begin
to
contemplate
with
a
sudden
leaping
of
the
heart
hopes
and
terrors
desires
and
ambitions
alien
to
my
orderly
and
careful
life
and
then
i
would
awake
shuddering
at
the
thought
that
some
great
imponderable
being
had
swept
through
my
mind
it
was
indeed
days
before
this
feeling
passed
perfectly
away
and
even
now
when
i
have
sought
refuge
in
the
only
definite
faith
i
feel
a
great
tolerance
for
those
people
with
incoherent
personalities
who
gather
in
the
chapels
and
of
certain
obscure
sects
because
i
also
have
felt
fixed
habits
and
principles
dissolving
before
a
power
which
was
or
sheer
madness
if
you
will
but
was
so
powerful
in
its
melancholy
exultation
that
i
tremble
lest
it
wake
again
and
drive
me
from
my
peace
when
we
came
in
the
grey
light
to
the
great
terminus
it
seemed
to
me
i
was
so
changed
that
i
was
no
more
as
man
is
a
moment
shuddering
at
eternity
but
eternity
weeping
and
laughing
over
a
moment
and
when
we
had
started
and
michael
robartes
had
fallen
asleep
as
he
soon
did
his
sleeping
face
in
which
there
was
no
sign
of
all
that
had
so
shaken
me
and
that
now
kept
me
wakeful
was
to
my
excited
mind
more
like
a
mask
than
a
face
the
fancy
possessed
me
that
the
man
behind
it
had
dissolved
away
like
salt
in
water
and
that
it
laughed
and
sighed
appealed
and
denounced
at
the
bidding
of
beings
greater
or
less
than
man
is
not
michael
robartes
at
all
michael
robartes
is
dead
dead
for
ten
for
twenty
years
perhaps
i
kept
repeating
to
myself
i
fell
at
last
into
a
feverish
sleep
waking
up
from
time
to
time
when
we
rushed
past
some
little
town
its
slated
roofs
shining
with
wet
or
still
lake
gleaming
in
the
cold
morning
light
i
had
been
too
preoccupied
to
ask
where
we
were
going
or
to
notice
what
tickets
michael
robartes
had
taken
but
i
knew
now
from
the
direction
of
the
sun
that
we
were
going
westward
and
presently
i
knew
also
by
the
way
in
which
the
trees
had
grown
into
the
semblance
of
tattered
beggars
flying
with
bent
heads
towards
the
east
that
we
were
approaching
the
western
coast
then
immediately
i
saw
the
sea
between
the
low
hills
upon
the
left
its
dull
grey
broken
into
white
patches
and
lines
when
we
left
the
train
we
had
still
i
found
some
way
to
go
and
set
out
buttoning
our
coats
about
us
for
the
wind
was
bitter
and
violent
michael
robartes
was
silent
seeming
anxious
to
leave
me
to
my
thoughts
and
as
we
walked
between
the
sea
and
the
rocky
side
of
a
great
promontory
i
realized
with
a
new
perfection
what
a
shock
had
been
given
to
all
my
habits
of
thought
and
of
feelings
if
indeed
some
mysterious
change
had
not
taken
place
in
the
substance
of
my
mind
for
the
grey
waves
plumed
with
scudding
foam
had
grown
part
of
a
teeming
fantastic
inner
life
and
when
michael
robartes
pointed
to
a
square
house
with
a
much
smaller
and
newer
building
under
its
lee
set
out
on
the
very
end
of
a
dilapidated
and
almost
deserted
pier
and
said
it
was
the
temple
of
the
alchemical
rose
i
was
possessed
with
the
phantasy
that
the
sea
which
kept
covering
it
with
showers
of
white
foam
was
claiming
it
as
part
of
some
indefinite
and
passionate
life
which
had
begun
to
war
upon
our
orderly
and
careful
days
and
was
about
to
plunge
the
world
into
a
night
as
obscure
as
that
which
followed
the
downfall
of
the
classical
world
one
part
of
my
mind
mocked
this
phantastic
terror
but
the
other
the
part
that
still
lay
half
plunged
in
vision
listened
to
the
clash
of
unknown
armies
and
shuddered
at
unimaginable
fanaticisms
that
hung
in
those
grey
leaping
waves
we
had
gone
but
a
few
paces
along
the
pier
when
we
came
upon
an
old
man
who
was
evidently
a
watchman
for
he
sat
in
an
overset
barrel
close
to
a
place
where
masons
had
been
lately
working
upon
a
break
in
the
pier
and
had
in
front
of
him
a
fire
such
as
one
sees
slung
under
carts
i
saw
that
he
was
also
a
voteen
as
the
peasants
say
for
there
was
a
rosary
hanging
from
a
nail
on
the
rim
of
the
barrel
and
as
i
saw
i
shuddered
and
i
did
not
know
why
i
shuddered
we
had
passed
him
a
few
yards
when
i
heard
him
cry
in
gaelic
idolaters
go
down
to
hell
with
your
witches
and
your
devils
go
down
to
hell
that
the
herrings
may
come
again
into
the
and
for
some
moments
i
could
hear
him
half
screaming
and
half
muttering
behind
us
you
not
afraid
i
said
these
wild
fishing
people
may
do
some
desperate
thing
against
you
and
mine
he
answered
long
past
human
hurt
or
help
being
incorporate
with
immortal
spirits
and
when
we
die
it
shall
be
the
consummation
of
the
supreme
work
a
time
will
come
for
these
people
also
and
they
will
sacrifice
a
mullet
to
artemis
or
some
other
fish
to
some
new
divinity
unless
indeed
their
own
divinities
the
dagda
with
his
overflowing
cauldron
lug
with
his
spear
dipped
in
lest
it
rush
forth
hot
for
battle
aengus
with
the
three
birds
on
his
shoulder
bodb
and
his
red
swineherd
and
all
the
heroic
children
of
dana
set
up
once
more
their
temples
of
grey
stone
their
reign
has
never
ceased
but
only
waned
in
power
a
little
for
the
sidhe
still
pass
in
every
wind
and
dance
and
play
at
hurley
and
fight
their
sudden
battles
in
every
hollow
and
on
every
hill
but
they
can
not
build
their
temples
again
till
there
have
been
martyrdoms
and
victories
and
perhaps
even
that
battle
in
the
valley
of
the
black
keeping
close
to
the
wall
that
went
about
the
pier
on
the
seaward
side
to
escape
the
driving
foam
and
the
wind
which
threatened
every
moment
to
lift
us
off
our
feet
we
made
our
way
in
silence
to
the
door
of
the
square
building
michael
robartes
opened
it
with
a
key
on
which
i
saw
the
rust
of
many
salt
winds
and
led
me
along
a
bare
passage
and
up
an
uncarpeted
stair
to
a
little
room
surrounded
with
bookshelves
a
meal
would
be
brought
but
only
of
fruit
for
i
must
submit
to
a
tempered
fast
before
the
ceremony
he
explained
and
with
it
a
book
on
the
doctrine
and
method
of
the
order
over
which
i
was
to
spend
what
remained
of
the
winter
daylight
he
then
left
me
promising
to
return
an
hour
before
the
ceremony
i
began
searching
among
the
bookshelves
and
found
one
of
the
most
exhaustive
alchemical
libraries
i
have
ever
seen
there
were
the
works
of
morienus
who
hid
his
immortal
body
under
a
shirt
of
of
avicenna
who
was
a
drunkard
and
yet
controlled
numberless
legions
of
spirits
of
alfarabi
who
put
so
many
spirits
into
his
lute
that
he
could
make
men
laugh
or
weep
or
fall
in
deadly
trance
as
he
would
of
lully
who
transformed
himself
into
the
likeness
of
a
red
cock
of
flamel
who
with
his
wife
parnella
achieved
the
elixir
many
hundreds
of
years
ago
and
is
fabled
to
live
still
in
arabia
among
the
dervishes
and
of
many
of
less
fame
there
were
very
few
mystics
but
alchemical
mystics
and
because
i
had
little
doubt
of
the
devotion
to
one
god
of
the
greater
number
and
of
the
limited
sense
of
beauty
which
robartes
would
hold
an
inevitable
consequence
but
i
did
notice
a
complete
set
of
facsimiles
of
the
prophetical
writings
of
william
blake
and
probably
because
of
the
multitudes
that
thronged
his
illumination
and
were
the
gay
fishes
on
the
wave
when
the
moon
sucks
up
the
i
noted
also
many
poets
and
prose
writers
of
every
age
but
only
those
who
were
a
little
weary
of
life
as
indeed
the
greatest
have
been
everywhere
and
who
cast
their
imagination
to
us
as
a
something
they
needed
no
longer
now
that
they
were
going
up
in
their
fiery
chariots
presently
i
heard
a
tap
at
the
door
and
a
woman
came
in
and
laid
a
little
fruit
upon
the
table
i
judged
that
she
had
once
been
handsome
but
her
cheeks
were
hollowed
by
what
i
would
have
held
had
i
seen
her
anywhere
else
an
excitement
of
the
flesh
and
a
thirst
for
pleasure
instead
of
which
it
doubtless
was
an
excitement
of
the
imagination
and
a
thirst
for
beauty
i
asked
her
some
question
concerning
the
ceremony
but
getting
no
answer
except
a
shake
of
the
head
saw
that
i
must
await
initiation
in
silence
when
i
had
eaten
she
came
again
and
having
laid
a
curiously
wrought
bronze
box
on
the
table
lighted
the
candles
and
took
away
the
plates
and
the
remnants
so
soon
as
i
was
alone
i
turned
to
the
box
and
found
that
the
peacocks
of
hera
spread
out
their
tails
over
the
sides
and
lid
against
a
background
on
which
were
wrought
great
stars
as
though
to
affirm
that
the
heavens
were
a
part
of
their
glory
in
the
box
was
a
book
bound
in
vellum
and
having
upon
the
vellum
and
in
very
delicate
colours
and
in
gold
the
alchemical
rose
with
many
spears
thrusting
against
it
but
in
vain
as
was
shown
by
the
shattered
points
of
those
nearest
to
the
petals
the
book
was
written
upon
vellum
and
in
beautiful
clear
letters
interspersed
with
symbolical
pictures
and
illuminations
after
the
manner
of
the
the
first
chapter
described
how
six
students
of
celtic
descent
gave
themselves
separately
to
the
study
of
alchemy
and
solved
one
the
mystery
of
the
pelican
another
the
mystery
of
the
green
dragon
another
the
mystery
of
the
eagle
another
that
of
salt
and
mercury
what
seemed
a
succession
of
accidents
but
was
the
book
declared
the
contrivance
of
preternatural
powers
brought
them
together
in
the
garden
of
an
inn
in
the
south
of
france
and
while
they
talked
together
the
thought
came
to
them
that
alchemy
was
the
gradual
distillation
of
the
contents
of
the
soul
until
they
were
ready
to
put
off
the
mortal
and
put
on
the
immortal
an
owl
passed
rustling
among
the
overhead
and
then
an
old
woman
came
leaning
upon
a
stick
and
sitting
close
to
them
took
up
the
thought
where
they
had
dropped
it
having
expounded
the
whole
principle
of
spiritual
alchemy
and
bid
them
found
the
order
of
the
alchemical
rose
she
passed
from
among
them
and
when
they
would
have
followed
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
they
formed
themselves
into
an
order
holding
their
goods
and
making
their
researches
in
common
and
as
they
became
perfect
in
the
alchemical
doctrine
apparitions
came
and
went
among
them
and
taught
them
more
and
more
marvellous
mysteries
the
book
then
went
on
to
expound
so
much
of
these
as
the
neophyte
was
permitted
to
know
dealing
at
the
outset
and
at
considerable
length
with
the
independent
reality
of
our
thoughts
which
was
it
declared
the
doctrine
from
which
all
true
doctrines
rose
if
you
imagine
it
said
the
semblance
of
a
living
being
it
is
at
once
possessed
by
a
wandering
soul
and
goes
hither
and
hither
working
good
or
evil
until
the
moment
of
its
death
has
come
and
gave
many
examples
received
it
said
from
many
gods
eros
had
taught
them
how
to
fashion
forms
in
which
a
divine
soul
could
dwell
and
whisper
what
they
would
into
sleeping
minds
and
ate
forms
from
which
demonic
beings
could
pour
madness
or
unquiet
dreams
into
sleeping
blood
and
hermes
that
if
you
powerfully
imagined
a
hound
at
your
bedside
it
would
keep
watch
there
until
you
woke
and
drive
away
all
but
the
mightiest
demons
but
that
if
your
imagination
was
weakly
the
hound
would
be
weakly
also
and
the
demons
prevail
and
the
hound
soon
die
and
aphrodite
that
if
you
made
by
a
strong
imagining
a
dove
crowned
with
silver
and
bad
it
flutter
over
your
head
its
soft
cooing
would
make
sweet
dreams
of
immortal
love
gather
and
brood
over
mortal
sleep
and
all
divinities
alike
had
revealed
with
many
warnings
and
lamentations
that
all
minds
are
continually
giving
birth
to
such
beings
and
sending
them
forth
to
work
health
or
disease
joy
or
madness
if
you
would
give
forms
to
the
evil
powers
it
went
on
you
were
to
make
them
ugly
thrusting
out
a
lip
with
the
thirsts
of
life
or
breaking
the
proportions
of
a
body
with
the
burdens
of
life
but
the
divine
powers
would
only
appear
in
beautiful
shapes
which
are
but
as
it
were
shapes
trembling
out
of
existence
folding
up
into
a
timeless
ecstasy
drifting
with
eyes
into
a
sleepy
stillness
the
bodiless
souls
who
descended
into
these
forms
were
what
men
call
the
moods
and
worked
all
great
changes
in
the
world
for
just
as
the
magician
or
the
artist
could
call
them
when
he
would
so
they
could
call
out
of
the
mind
of
the
magician
or
the
artist
or
if
they
were
demons
out
of
the
mind
of
the
mad
or
the
ignoble
what
shape
they
would
and
through
its
voice
and
its
gestures
pour
themselves
out
upon
the
world
in
this
way
all
great
events
were
accomplished
a
mood
a
divinity
or
a
demon
first
descending
like
a
faint
sigh
into
minds
and
then
changing
their
thoughts
and
their
actions
until
hair
that
was
yellow
had
grown
black
or
hair
that
was
black
had
grown
yellow
and
empires
moved
their
border
as
though
they
were
but
drifts
of
leaves
the
rest
of
the
book
contained
symbols
of
form
and
sound
and
colour
and
their
attribution
to
divinities
and
demons
so
that
the
initiate
might
fashion
a
shape
for
any
divinity
or
any
demon
and
be
as
powerful
as
avicenna
among
those
who
live
under
the
roots
of
tears
and
of
laughter
iv
a
couple
of
hours
after
sunset
michael
robartes
returned
and
told
me
that
i
would
have
to
learn
the
steps
of
an
exceedingly
antique
dance
because
before
my
initiation
could
be
perfected
i
had
to
join
three
times
in
a
magical
dance
for
rhythm
was
the
wheel
of
eternity
on
which
alone
the
transient
and
accidental
could
be
broken
and
the
spirit
set
free
i
found
that
the
steps
which
were
simple
enough
resembled
certain
antique
greek
dances
and
having
been
a
good
dancer
in
my
youth
and
the
master
of
many
curious
gaelic
steps
i
soon
had
them
in
my
memory
he
then
robed
me
and
himself
in
a
costume
which
suggested
by
its
shape
both
greece
and
egypt
but
by
its
crimson
colour
a
more
passionate
life
than
theirs
and
having
put
into
my
hands
a
little
chainless
censer
of
bronze
wrought
into
the
likeness
of
a
rose
by
some
modern
craftsman
he
told
me
to
open
a
small
door
opposite
to
the
door
by
which
i
had
entered
i
put
my
hand
to
the
handle
but
the
moment
i
did
so
the
fumes
of
the
incense
helped
perhaps
by
his
mysterious
glamour
made
me
fall
again
into
a
dream
in
which
i
seemed
to
be
a
mask
lying
on
the
counter
of
a
little
eastern
shop
many
persons
with
eyes
so
bright
and
still
that
i
knew
them
for
more
than
human
came
in
and
tried
me
on
their
faces
but
at
last
flung
me
into
a
corner
with
a
little
laughter
but
all
this
passed
in
a
moment
for
when
i
awoke
my
hand
was
still
upon
the
handle
i
opened
the
door
and
found
myself
in
a
marvellous
passage
along
whose
sides
were
many
divinities
wrought
in
a
mosaic
not
less
beautiful
than
the
mosaic
in
the
baptistery
at
ravenna
but
of
a
less
severe
beauty
the
predominant
colour
of
each
divinity
which
was
surely
a
symbolic
colour
being
repeated
in
the
lamps
that
hung
from
the
ceiling
a
lamp
before
every
divinity
i
passed
on
marvelling
exceedingly
how
these
enthusiasts
could
have
created
all
this
beauty
in
so
remote
a
place
and
half
persuaded
to
believe
in
a
material
alchemy
by
the
sight
of
so
much
hidden
wealth
the
censer
filling
the
air
as
i
passed
with
smoke
of
colour
i
stopped
before
a
door
on
whose
bronze
panels
were
wrought
great
waves
in
whose
shadow
were
faint
suggestions
of
terrible
faces
those
beyond
it
seemed
to
have
heard
our
steps
for
a
voice
cried
the
work
of
the
incorruptible
fire
at
an
end
and
immediately
michael
robartes
answered
perfect
gold
has
come
from
the
the
door
swung
open
and
we
were
in
a
great
circular
room
and
among
men
and
women
who
were
dancing
slowly
in
crimson
robes
upon
the
ceiling
was
an
immense
rose
wrought
in
mosaic
and
about
the
walls
also
in
mosaic
was
a
battle
of
gods
and
angels
the
gods
glimmering
like
rubies
and
sapphires
and
the
angels
of
the
one
greyness
because
as
michael
robartes
whispered
they
had
renounced
their
divinity
and
turned
from
the
unfolding
of
their
separate
hearts
out
of
love
for
a
god
of
humility
and
sorrow
pillars
supported
the
roof
and
made
a
kind
of
circular
cloister
each
pillar
being
a
column
of
confused
shapes
divinities
it
seemed
of
the
wind
who
rose
as
in
a
whirling
dance
of
more
than
human
vehemence
and
playing
upon
pipes
and
cymbals
and
from
among
these
shapes
were
thrust
out
hands
and
in
these
hands
were
censers
i
was
bid
place
my
censer
also
in
a
hand
and
take
my
place
and
dance
and
as
i
turned
from
the
pillars
towards
the
dancers
i
saw
that
the
floor
was
of
a
green
stone
and
that
a
pale
christ
on
a
pale
cross
was
wrought
in
the
midst
i
asked
robartes
the
meaning
of
this
and
was
told
that
they
desired
trouble
his
unity
with
their
multitudinous
the
dance
wound
in
and
out
tracing
upon
the
floor
the
shapes
of
petals
that
copied
the
petals
in
the
rose
overhead
and
to
the
sound
of
hidden
instruments
which
were
perhaps
of
an
antique
pattern
for
i
have
never
heard
the
like
and
every
moment
the
dance
was
more
passionate
until
all
the
winds
of
the
world
seemed
to
have
awakened
under
our
feet
after
a
little
i
had
grown
weary
and
stood
under
a
pillar
watching
the
coming
and
going
of
those
figures
until
gradually
i
sank
into
a
from
which
i
was
awakened
by
seeing
the
petals
of
the
great
rose
which
had
no
longer
the
look
of
mosaic
falling
slowly
through
the
air
and
as
they
fell
shaping
into
the
likeness
of
living
beings
of
an
extraordinary
beauty
still
faint
and
they
began
to
dance
and
as
they
danced
took
a
more
and
more
definite
shape
so
that
i
was
able
to
distinguish
beautiful
grecian
faces
and
august
egyptian
faces
and
now
and
again
to
name
a
divinity
by
the
staff
in
his
hand
or
by
a
bird
fluttering
over
his
head
and
soon
every
mortal
foot
danced
by
the
white
foot
of
an
immortal
and
in
the
troubled
eyes
that
looked
into
untroubled
shadowy
eyes
i
saw
the
brightness
of
uttermost
desire
as
though
they
had
found
at
length
after
unreckonable
wandering
the
lost
love
of
their
youth
sometimes
but
only
for
a
moment
i
saw
a
faint
solitary
figure
with
a
veiled
face
and
carrying
a
faint
torch
flit
among
the
dancers
but
like
a
dream
within
a
dream
like
a
shadow
of
a
shadow
and
i
knew
by
an
understanding
born
from
a
deeper
fountain
than
thought
that
it
was
eros
himself
and
that
his
face
was
veiled
because
no
man
or
woman
from
the
beginning
of
the
world
has
ever
known
what
love
is
or
looked
into
his
eyes
for
eros
alone
of
divinities
is
altogether
a
spirit
and
hides
in
passions
not
of
his
essence
if
he
would
commune
with
a
mortal
heart
so
that
if
a
man
love
nobly
he
knows
love
through
infinite
pity
unspeakable
trust
unending
sympathy
and
if
ignobly
through
vehement
jealousy
sudden
hatred
and
unappeasable
desire
but
unveiled
love
he
never
knows
while
i
thought
these
things
a
voice
cried
to
me
from
the
crimson
figures
the
dance
there
is
none
that
can
be
spared
out
of
the
dance
into
the
dance
into
the
dance
that
the
gods
may
make
them
bodies
out
of
the
substance
of
our
and
before
i
could
answer
a
mysterious
wave
of
passion
that
seemed
like
the
soul
of
the
dance
moving
within
our
souls
took
hold
of
me
and
i
was
swept
neither
consenting
nor
refusing
into
the
midst
i
was
dancing
with
an
immortal
august
woman
who
had
black
lilies
in
her
hair
and
her
dreamy
gesture
seemed
laden
with
a
wisdom
more
profound
than
the
darkness
that
is
between
star
and
star
and
with
a
love
like
the
love
that
breathed
upon
the
waters
and
as
we
danced
on
and
on
the
incense
drifted
over
us
and
round
us
covering
us
away
as
in
the
heart
of
the
world
and
ages
seemed
to
pass
and
tempests
to
awake
and
perish
in
the
folds
of
our
robes
and
in
her
heavy
hair
suddenly
i
remembered
that
her
eyelids
had
never
quivered
and
that
her
lilies
had
not
dropped
a
black
petal
or
shaken
from
their
places
and
understood
with
a
great
horror
that
i
danced
with
one
who
was
more
or
less
than
human
and
who
was
drinking
up
my
soul
as
an
ox
drinks
up
a
wayside
pool
and
i
fell
and
darkness
passed
over
me
v
i
awoke
suddenly
as
though
something
had
awakened
me
and
saw
that
i
was
lying
on
a
roughly
painted
floor
and
that
on
the
ceiling
which
was
at
no
great
distance
was
a
roughly
painted
rose
and
about
me
on
the
walls
paintings
the
pillars
and
the
censers
had
gone
and
near
me
a
score
of
sleepers
lay
wrapped
in
disordered
robes
their
upturned
faces
looking
to
my
imagination
like
hollow
masks
and
a
chill
dawn
was
shining
down
upon
them
from
a
long
window
i
had
not
noticed
before
and
outside
the
sea
roared
i
saw
michael
robartes
lying
at
a
little
distance
and
beside
him
an
overset
bowl
of
wrought
bronze
which
looked
as
though
it
had
once
held
incense
as
i
sat
thus
i
heard
a
sudden
tumult
of
angry
men
and
voices
mix
with
the
roaring
of
the
sea
and
leaping
to
my
feet
i
went
quickly
to
michael
robartes
and
tried
to
shake
him
out
of
his
sleep
i
then
seized
him
by
the
shoulder
and
tried
to
lift
him
but
he
fell
backwards
and
sighed
faintly
and
the
voices
became
louder
and
angrier
and
there
was
a
sound
of
heavy
blows
upon
the
door
which
opened
on
to
the
pier
suddenly
i
heard
a
sound
of
rending
wood
and
i
knew
it
had
begun
to
give
and
i
ran
to
the
door
of
the
room
i
pushed
it
open
and
came
out
upon
a
passage
whose
bare
boards
clattered
under
my
feet
and
found
in
the
passage
another
door
which
led
into
an
empty
kitchen
and
as
i
passed
through
the
door
i
heard
two
crashes
in
quick
succession
and
knew
by
the
sudden
noise
of
feet
and
the
shouts
that
the
door
which
opened
on
to
the
pier
had
fallen
inwards
i
ran
from
the
kitchen
and
out
into
a
small
yard
and
from
this
down
some
steps
which
descended
the
seaward
and
sloping
side
of
the
pier
and
from
the
steps
clambered
along
the
edge
with
the
angry
voices
ringing
in
my
ears
this
part
of
the
pier
had
been
but
lately
refaced
with
blocks
of
granite
so
that
it
was
almost
clear
of
seaweed
but
when
i
came
to
the
old
part
i
found
it
so
slippery
with
green
weed
that
i
had
to
climb
up
on
to
the
roadway
i
looked
towards
the
temple
of
the
alchemical
rose
where
the
fishermen
and
the
women
were
still
shouting
but
somewhat
more
faintly
and
saw
that
there
was
no
one
about
the
door
or
upon
the
pier
but
as
i
looked
a
little
crowd
hurried
out
of
the
door
and
began
gathering
large
stones
from
where
they
were
heaped
up
in
readiness
for
the
next
time
a
storm
shattered
the
pier
when
they
would
be
laid
under
blocks
of
granite
while
i
stood
watching
the
crowd
an
old
man
who
was
i
think
the
voteen
pointed
to
me
and
screamed
out
something
and
the
crowd
whitened
for
all
the
faces
had
turned
towards
me
i
ran
and
it
was
well
for
me
that
pullers
of
the
oar
are
poorer
men
with
their
feet
than
with
their
arms
and
their
bodies
and
yet
while
i
ran
i
scarcely
heard
the
following
feet
or
the
angry
voices
for
many
voices
of
exultation
and
lamentation
which
were
forgotten
as
a
dream
is
forgotten
the
moment
they
were
heard
seemed
to
be
ringing
in
the
air
over
my
head
there
are
moments
even
now
when
i
seem
to
hear
those
voices
of
exultation
and
lamentation
and
when
the
indefinite
world
which
has
but
half
lost
its
mastery
over
my
heart
and
my
intellect
seems
about
to
claim
a
perfect
mastery
but
i
carry
the
rosary
about
my
neck
and
when
i
hear
or
seem
to
hear
them
i
press
it
to
my
heart
and
say
whose
name
is
legion
is
at
our
doors
deceiving
our
intellects
with
subtlety
and
flattering
our
hearts
with
beauty
and
we
have
no
trust
but
in
and
then
the
war
that
rages
within
me
at
other
times
is
still
and
i
am
at
peace
the
tables
of
the
law
i
you
permit
me
aherne
i
said
ask
you
a
question
which
i
have
wanted
to
ask
you
for
years
and
have
not
asked
because
we
have
grown
nearly
strangers
why
did
you
refuse
the
berretta
and
almost
at
the
last
moment
when
you
and
i
lived
together
you
cared
neither
for
wine
women
nor
money
and
had
thoughts
for
nothing
but
theology
and
i
had
watched
through
dinner
for
a
moment
to
put
my
question
and
ventured
now
because
he
had
thrown
off
a
little
of
the
reserve
and
indifference
which
ever
since
his
last
return
from
italy
had
taken
the
place
of
our
once
close
friendship
he
had
just
questioned
me
too
about
certain
private
and
almost
sacred
things
and
my
frankness
had
earned
i
thought
a
like
frankness
from
him
when
i
began
to
speak
he
was
lifting
to
his
lips
a
glass
of
that
old
wine
which
he
could
choose
so
well
and
valued
so
little
and
while
i
spoke
he
set
it
slowly
and
meditatively
upon
the
table
and
held
it
there
its
deep
red
light
dyeing
his
long
delicate
fingers
the
impression
of
his
face
and
form
as
they
were
then
is
still
vivid
with
me
and
is
inseparable
from
another
and
fanciful
impression
the
impression
of
a
man
holding
a
flame
in
his
naked
hand
he
was
to
me
at
that
moment
the
supreme
type
of
our
race
which
when
it
has
risen
above
or
is
sunken
below
the
formalisms
of
and
the
rationalisms
of
conventional
affirmation
and
denial
turns
away
unless
my
hopes
for
the
world
and
for
the
church
have
made
me
blind
from
practicable
desires
and
intuitions
towards
desires
so
unbounded
that
no
human
vessel
can
contain
them
intuitions
so
immaterial
that
their
sudden
and
fire
leaves
heavy
darkness
about
hand
and
foot
he
had
the
nature
which
is
half
monk
half
soldier
of
fortune
and
must
needs
turn
action
into
dreaming
and
dreaming
into
action
and
for
such
there
is
no
order
no
finality
no
contentment
in
this
world
when
he
and
i
had
been
students
in
paris
we
had
belonged
to
a
little
group
which
devoted
itself
to
speculations
about
alchemy
and
mysticism
more
orthodox
in
most
of
his
beliefs
than
michael
robartes
he
had
surpassed
him
in
a
fanciful
hatred
of
all
life
and
this
hatred
had
found
expression
in
the
curious
paradox
half
borrowed
from
some
fanatical
monk
half
invented
by
himself
that
the
beautiful
arts
were
sent
into
the
world
to
overthrow
nations
and
finally
life
herself
by
sowing
everywhere
unlimited
desires
like
torches
thrown
into
a
burning
city
this
idea
was
not
at
the
time
i
believe
more
than
a
paradox
a
plume
of
the
pride
of
youth
and
it
was
only
after
his
return
to
ireland
that
he
endured
the
fermentation
of
belief
which
is
coming
upon
our
people
with
the
reawakening
of
their
imaginative
life
presently
he
stood
up
saying
and
i
will
show
you
for
you
at
any
rate
will
understand
and
taking
candles
from
the
table
he
lit
the
way
into
the
long
paved
passage
that
led
to
his
private
chapel
we
passed
between
the
portraits
of
the
jesuits
and
priests
some
of
no
little
fame
his
family
had
given
to
the
church
and
engravings
and
photographs
of
pictures
that
had
especially
moved
him
and
the
few
paintings
his
small
fortune
eked
out
by
an
almost
penurious
abstinence
from
the
things
most
men
desire
had
enabled
him
to
buy
in
his
travels
the
pictures
that
i
knew
best
for
they
had
hung
there
longest
whether
reproductions
or
originals
were
of
the
sienese
school
which
he
had
studied
for
a
long
time
claiming
that
it
alone
of
the
schools
of
the
world
pictured
not
the
world
but
what
is
revealed
to
saints
in
their
dreams
and
visions
the
sienese
alone
among
italians
he
would
say
could
not
or
would
not
represent
the
pride
of
life
the
pleasure
in
swift
movement
or
sustaining
strength
or
voluptuous
flesh
they
were
so
little
interested
in
these
things
that
there
often
seemed
to
be
no
human
body
at
all
under
the
robe
of
the
saint
but
they
could
represent
by
a
bowed
head
or
uplifted
face
reverence
before
eternity
as
no
others
could
and
they
were
at
their
happiest
when
mankind
had
dwindled
to
a
little
group
silhouetted
upon
a
golden
abyss
as
if
they
saw
the
world
habitually
from
far
off
when
i
had
praised
some
school
that
had
dipped
deeper
into
life
he
would
profess
to
discover
a
more
intense
emotion
than
life
knew
in
those
dark
outlines
even
francesca
who
felt
the
supernatural
as
deeply
he
would
say
the
work
of
siena
and
one
finds
a
faint
impurity
in
his
awe
a
touch
of
ghostly
terror
where
love
and
humbleness
had
best
been
he
had
often
told
me
of
his
hope
that
by
filling
his
mind
with
those
holy
pictures
he
would
help
himself
to
attain
at
last
to
vision
and
ecstasy
and
of
his
disappointment
at
never
getting
more
than
dreams
of
a
curious
and
broken
beauty
but
of
late
he
had
added
pictures
of
a
different
kind
french
symbolistic
pictures
which
he
had
bought
for
a
few
pounds
from
painters
english
and
french
pictures
of
the
school
of
the
english
and
now
he
stood
for
a
moment
and
said
have
changed
my
taste
i
am
fascinated
a
little
against
my
will
by
these
faces
where
i
find
the
pallor
of
souls
trembling
between
the
excitement
of
the
flesh
and
the
excitement
of
the
spirit
and
by
landscapes
that
are
created
by
heightening
the
obscurity
and
disorder
of
nature
these
landscapes
do
not
stir
the
imagination
to
the
energies
of
sanctity
but
as
to
orgaic
dancing
and
prophetic
i
saw
with
some
resentment
new
images
where
the
old
ones
had
often
made
that
long
gray
dim
empty
echoing
passage
become
to
my
eyes
a
vestibule
of
eternity
almost
every
detail
of
the
chapel
which
we
entered
by
a
narrow
gothic
door
whose
threshold
had
been
worn
smooth
by
the
secret
worshippers
of
the
penal
times
was
vivid
in
my
memory
for
it
was
in
this
chapel
that
i
had
first
and
when
but
a
boy
been
moved
by
the
mediævalism
which
is
now
i
think
the
governing
influence
in
my
life
the
only
thing
that
seemed
new
was
a
square
bronze
box
which
stood
upon
the
altar
before
the
six
unlighted
candles
and
the
ebony
crucifix
and
was
like
those
made
in
ancient
times
of
more
precious
substances
to
hold
the
sacred
books
aherne
made
me
sit
down
on
an
oak
bench
and
having
bowed
very
low
before
the
crucifix
took
the
bronze
box
from
the
altar
and
sat
down
beside
me
with
the
box
upon
his
knees
will
perhaps
have
forgotten
he
said
of
what
you
have
read
about
joachim
of
flora
for
he
is
little
more
than
a
name
to
even
the
well
read
he
was
an
abbot
in
cortale
in
the
twelfth
century
and
is
best
known
for
his
prophecy
in
a
book
called
in
that
the
kingdom
of
the
father
was
passed
the
kingdom
of
the
son
passing
the
kingdom
of
the
spirit
yet
to
come
the
kingdom
of
the
spirit
was
to
be
a
complete
triumph
of
the
spirit
the
he
called
it
over
the
dead
letter
he
had
many
followers
among
the
more
extreme
franciscans
and
these
were
accused
of
possessing
a
secret
book
of
his
called
the
inducens
in
evangelium
again
and
again
groups
of
visionaries
were
accused
of
possessing
this
terrible
book
in
which
the
freedom
of
the
renaissance
lay
hidden
until
at
last
pope
alexander
iv
had
it
found
and
cast
into
the
flames
i
have
here
the
greatest
treasure
the
world
contains
i
have
a
copy
of
that
book
and
see
what
great
artists
have
made
the
robes
in
which
it
is
wrapped
the
greater
portion
of
the
book
itself
is
illuminated
in
the
byzantine
style
which
so
few
care
for
but
which
moves
me
because
these
tall
emaciated
angels
and
saints
seem
to
have
less
relation
to
the
world
about
us
than
to
an
abstract
pattern
of
flowing
lines
that
suggest
an
imagination
absorbed
in
the
contemplation
of
eternity
even
if
you
do
not
care
for
so
formal
an
art
you
can
not
help
seeing
that
work
where
there
is
so
much
gold
and
of
that
purple
colour
which
has
gold
dissolved
in
it
was
valued
at
a
great
price
in
its
day
but
it
was
only
at
the
renaissance
the
labour
was
spent
upon
it
which
has
made
it
the
priceless
thing
it
is
the
wooden
boards
of
the
cover
show
by
the
astrological
allegories
painted
upon
them
as
by
the
style
of
painting
itself
some
craftsman
of
the
school
of
francesco
cossi
of
ferrara
but
the
gold
clasps
and
hinges
are
known
to
be
the
work
of
benvenuto
cellini
who
made
likewise
the
bronze
box
and
covered
it
with
gods
and
demons
whose
eyes
are
closed
to
signify
an
absorption
in
the
inner
light
i
took
the
book
in
my
hands
and
began
turning
over
the
gilded
pages
holding
it
close
to
the
candle
to
discover
the
texture
of
the
paper
did
you
get
this
amazing
book
i
said
genuine
and
i
can
not
judge
by
this
light
you
have
discovered
one
of
the
most
precious
things
in
the
is
certainly
genuine
he
replied
the
original
was
destroyed
one
copy
alone
remained
and
was
in
the
hands
of
a
of
florence
and
from
him
it
passed
to
his
son
and
so
from
generation
to
generation
until
it
came
to
the
who
was
father
to
benvenuto
cellini
and
from
benvenuto
cellini
to
that
cardinal
of
ferrara
who
released
him
from
prison
and
from
him
to
a
natural
son
so
from
generation
to
generation
the
story
of
its
wandering
passing
on
with
it
until
it
came
into
the
possession
of
the
family
of
aretino
and
to
giulio
aretino
an
artist
and
worker
in
metals
and
student
of
the
kabalistic
heresies
of
pico
della
mirandola
he
spent
many
nights
with
me
at
rome
discussing
philosophy
and
at
last
i
won
his
confidence
so
perfectly
that
he
showed
me
this
his
greatest
treasure
and
finding
how
much
i
valued
it
and
feeling
that
he
himself
was
growing
old
and
beyond
the
help
of
its
teaching
he
sold
it
to
me
for
no
great
sum
considering
its
great
is
the
doctrine
i
said
mediæval
about
the
nature
of
the
trinity
which
is
only
useful
to
show
how
many
things
are
unimportant
to
us
which
once
shook
the
world
could
never
make
you
understand
he
said
with
a
sigh
nothing
is
unimportant
in
belief
but
even
you
will
admit
that
this
book
goes
to
the
heart
do
you
see
the
tables
on
which
the
commandments
were
written
in
latin
i
looked
to
the
end
of
the
room
opposite
to
the
altar
and
saw
that
the
two
marble
tablets
were
gone
and
that
two
large
empty
tablets
of
ivory
like
large
copies
of
the
little
tablets
we
set
over
our
desks
had
taken
their
place
has
swept
the
commandments
of
the
father
away
he
went
on
displaced
the
commandments
of
the
son
by
the
commandments
of
the
holy
spirit
the
first
book
is
called
in
the
first
chapter
it
mentions
the
names
of
the
great
artists
who
made
them
graven
things
and
the
likeness
of
many
things
and
adored
them
and
served
them
and
the
second
the
names
of
the
great
wits
who
took
the
name
of
the
lord
their
god
in
vain
and
that
long
third
chapter
set
with
the
emblems
of
sanctified
faces
and
having
wings
upon
its
borders
is
the
praise
of
breakers
of
the
seventh
day
and
wasters
of
the
six
days
who
yet
lived
comely
and
pleasant
days
those
two
chapters
tell
of
men
and
women
who
railed
upon
their
parents
remembering
that
their
god
was
older
than
the
god
of
their
parents
and
that
which
has
the
sword
of
michael
for
an
emblem
commends
the
kings
that
wrought
secret
murder
and
so
won
for
their
people
a
peace
that
was
somnoque
gravata
et
vestibus
heavy
with
love
and
sleep
and
raiment
and
that
with
the
pale
star
at
the
closing
has
the
lives
of
the
noble
youths
who
loved
the
wives
of
others
and
were
transformed
into
memories
which
have
transformed
many
poorer
hearts
into
sweet
flames
and
that
with
the
winged
head
is
the
history
of
the
robbers
who
lived
upon
the
sea
or
in
the
desert
lives
which
it
compares
to
the
twittering
of
the
string
of
a
bow
stridentis
and
those
two
last
that
are
fire
and
gold
are
devoted
to
the
satirists
who
bore
false
witness
against
their
neighbours
and
yet
illustrated
eternal
wrath
and
to
those
that
have
coveted
more
than
other
men
the
house

in

second
book
is
called
and
describes
the
true
inspiration
of
action
the
only
eternal
evangel
and
ends
with
a
vision
which
he
saw
among
the
mountains
of
la
sila
of
his
disciples
sitting
throned
in
the
blue
deep
of
the
air
and
laughing
aloud
with
a
laughter
that
was
like
the
rustling
of
the
wings
of
time
in
cœruleis
ridentes
sedebant
discipuli
mei
super
thronos

know
little
of
joachim
of
flora
i
said
that
dante
set
him
in
paradise
among
the
great
doctors
if
he
held
a
heresy
so
singular
i
can
not
understand
how
no
rumours
of
it
came
to
the
ears
of
dante
and
dante
made
no
peace
with
the
enemies
of
the
of
flora
acknowledged
openly
the
authority
of
the
church
and
even
asked
that
all
his
published
writings
and
those
to
be
published
by
his
desire
after
his
death
should
be
submitted
to
the
censorship
of
the
pope
he
considered
that
those
whose
work
was
to
live
and
not
to
reveal
were
children
and
that
the
pope
was
their
father
but
he
taught
in
secret
that
certain
others
and
in
always
increasing
numbers
were
elected
not
to
live
but
to
reveal
that
hidden
substance
of
god
which
is
colour
and
music
and
softness
and
a
sweet
odour
and
that
these
have
no
father
but
the
holy
spirit
just
as
poets
and
painters
and
musicians
labour
at
their
works
building
them
with
lawless
and
lawful
things
alike
so
long
as
they
embody
the
beauty
that
is
beyond
the
grave
these
children
of
the
holy
spirit
labour
at
their
moments
with
eyes
upon
the
shining
substance
on
which
time
has
heaped
the
refuse
of
creation
for
the
world
only
exists
to
be
a
tale
in
the
ears
of
coming
generations
and
terror
and
content
birth
and
death
love
and
hatred
and
the
fruit
of
the
tree
are
but
instruments
for
that
supreme
art
which
is
to
win
us
from
life
and
gather
us
into
eternity
like
doves
into
their
shall
go
away
in
a
little
while
and
travel
into
many
lands
that
i
may
know
all
accidents
and
destinies
and
when
i
return
will
write
my
secret
law
upon
those
ivory
tablets
just
as
poets
and
romance
writers
have
written
the
principles
of
their
art
in
prefaces
and
when
i
know
what
principle
of
life
discoverable
at
first
by
imagination
and
instinct
i
am
to
express
i
will
gather
my
pupils
that
they
may
discover
their
law
in
the
study
of
my
law
as
poets
and
painters
discover
their
own
art
of
expression
by
the
study
of
some
master
i
know
nothing
certain
as
yet
but
this
i
am
to
become
completely
alive
that
is
completely
passionate
for
beauty
is
only
another
name
for
perfect
passion
i
shall
create
a
world
where
the
whole
lives
of
men
shall
be
articulated
and
simplified
as
if
seventy
years
were
but
one
moment
or
as
they
were
the
leaping
of
a
fish
or
the
opening
of
a
he
was
pacing
up
and
down
and
i
listened
to
the
fervour
of
his
words
and
watched
the
excitement
of
his
gestures
with
not
a
little
concern
i
had
been
accustomed
to
welcome
the
most
singular
speculations
and
had
always
found
them
as
harmless
as
the
persian
cat
who
half
closes
her
meditative
eyes
and
stretches
out
her
long
claws
before
my
fire
but
now
i
would
battle
in
the
interests
of
orthodoxy
even
of
the
commonplace
and
yet
could
find
nothing
better
to
say
than
is
not
necessary
to
judge
everyone
by
the
law
for
we
have
also
commandment
of
he
turned
and
said
looking
at
me
with
shining
eyes
swift
made
a
soul
for
the
gentlemen
of
this
city
by
hating
his
neighbour
as
any
rate
you
can
not
deny
that
to
teach
so
dangerous
a
doctrine
is
to
accept
a
terrible
da
vinci
he
replied
this
noble
sentence
hope
and
desire
of
returning
home
to
former
state
is
like
the
desire
for
the
light
and
the
man
who
with
constant
longing
awaits
each
new
month
and
new
year
deeming
that
the
things
he
longs
for
are
ever
too
late
in
coming
does
not
perceive
that
he
is
longing
for
his
own
how
then
can
the
pathway
which
will
lead
us
into
the
heart
of
god
be
other
than
dangerous
why
should
you
who
are
no
materialist
cherish
the
continuity
and
order
of
the
world
as
those
do
who
have
only
the
world
you
do
not
value
the
writers
who
will
express
nothing
unless
their
reason
understands
how
it
will
make
what
is
called
the
right
more
easy
why
then
will
you
deny
a
like
freedom
to
the
supreme
art
the
art
which
is
the
foundation
of
all
arts
yes
i
shall
send
out
of
this
chapel
saints
lovers
rebels
and
prophets
souls
who
will
surround
themselves
with
peace
as
with
a
nest
made
with
grass
and
others
over
whom
i
shall
weep
the
dust
shall
fall
for
many
years
over
this
little
box
and
then
i
shall
open
it
and
the
tumults
which
are
perhaps
the
flames
of
the
last
day
shall
come
from
under
the
i
did
not
reason
with
him
that
night
because
his
excitement
was
great
and
i
feared
to
make
him
angry
and
when
i
called
at
his
house
a
few
days
later
he
was
gone
and
his
house
was
locked
up
and
empty
i
have
deeply
regretted
my
failure
both
to
combat
his
heresy
and
to
test
the
genuineness
of
his
strange
book
since
my
conversion
i
have
indeed
done
penance
for
an
error
which
i
was
only
able
to
measure
after
some
years
ii
i
was
walking
along
one
of
the
dublin
quays
on
the
side
nearest
the
river
about
ten
years
after
our
conversation
stopping
from
time
to
time
to
turn
over
the
books
upon
an
old
bookstall
and
thinking
curiously
enough
of
the
terrible
destiny
of
michael
robartes
and
his
brotherhood
when
i
saw
a
tall
and
bent
man
walking
slowly
along
the
other
side
of
the
quay
i
recognized
with
a
start
in
a
lifeless
mask
with
dim
eyes
the
once
resolute
and
delicate
face
of
owen
aherne
i
crossed
the
quay
quickly
but
had
not
gone
many
yards
before
he
turned
away
as
though
he
had
seen
me
and
hurried
down
a
side
street
i
followed
but
only
to
lose
him
among
the
intricate
streets
on
the
north
side
of
the
river
during
the
next
few
weeks
i
inquired
of
everybody
who
had
once
known
him
but
he
had
made
himself
known
to
nobody
and
i
knocked
without
result
at
the
door
of
his
old
house
and
had
nearly
persuaded
myself
that
i
was
mistaken
when
i
saw
him
again
in
a
narrow
street
behind
the
four
courts
and
followed
him
to
the
door
of
his
house
i
laid
my
hand
on
his
arm
he
turned
quite
without
surprise
and
indeed
it
is
possible
that
to
him
whose
inner
life
had
soaked
up
the
outer
life
a
parting
of
years
was
a
parting
from
forenoon
to
afternoon
he
stood
holding
the
door
half
open
as
though
he
would
keep
me
from
entering
and
would
perhaps
have
parted
from
me
without
further
words
had
i
not
said
aherne
you
trusted
me
once
will
you
not
trust
me
again
and
tell
me
what
has
come
of
the
ideas
we
discussed
in
this
house
ten
years
ago
but
perhaps
you
have
already
forgotten
have
a
right
to
hear
he
said
since
i
have
told
you
the
ideas
i
should
tell
you
the
extreme
danger
they
contain
or
rather
the
boundless
wickedness
they
contain
but
when
you
have
heard
this
we
must
part
and
part
for
ever
because
i
am
lost
and
must
be
hidden
i
followed
him
through
the
paved
passage
and
saw
that
its
corners
were
choked
and
the
pictures
gray
with
dust
and
cobwebs
and
that
the
dust
and
cobwebs
which
covered
the
ruby
and
sapphire
of
the
saints
on
the
window
had
made
it
very
dim
he
pointed
to
where
the
ivory
tablets
glimmered
faintly
in
the
dimness
and
i
saw
that
they
were
covered
with
small
writing
and
went
up
to
them
and
began
to
read
the
writing
it
was
in
latin
and
was
an
elaborate
casuistry
illustrated
with
many
examples
but
whether
from
his
own
life
or
from
the
lives
of
others
i
do
not
know
i
had
read
but
a
few
sentences
when
i
imagined
that
a
faint
perfume
had
begun
to
fill
the
room
and
turning
round
asked
owen
aherne
if
he
were
lighting
the
incense
he
replied
and
pointed
where
the
thurible
lay
rusty
and
empty
on
one
of
the
benches
as
he
spoke
the
faint
perfume
seemed
to
vanish
and
i
was
persuaded
i
had
imagined
it
the
philosophy
of
the
inducens
in
evangelium
made
you
very
unhappy
i
said
first
i
was
full
of
happiness
he
replied
i
felt
a
divine
ecstasy
an
immortal
fire
in
every
passion
in
every
hope
in
every
desire
in
every
dream
and
i
saw
in
the
shadows
under
leaves
in
the
hollow
waters
in
the
eyes
of
men
and
women
its
image
as
in
a
mirror
and
it
was
as
though
i
was
about
to
touch
the
heart
of
god
then
all
changed
and
i
was
full
of
misery
and
i
said
to
myself
that
i
was
caught
in
the
glittering
folds
of
an
enormous
serpent
and
was
falling
with
him
through
a
fathomless
abyss
and
that
henceforth
the
glittering
folds
were
my
world
and
in
my
misery
it
was
revealed
to
me
that
man
can
only
come
to
that
heart
through
the
sense
of
separation
from
it
which
we
call
sin
and
i
understood
that
i
could
not
sin
because
i
had
discovered
the
law
of
my
being
and
could
only
express
or
fail
to
express
my
being
and
i
understood
that
god
has
made
a
simple
and
an
arbitrary
law
that
we
may
sin
and
repent
he
had
sat
down
on
one
of
the
wooden
benches
and
now
became
silent
his
bowed
head
and
hanging
arms
and
listless
body
having
more
of
dejection
than
any
image
i
have
met
with
in
life
or
in
any
art
i
went
and
stood
leaning
against
the
altar
and
watched
him
not
knowing
what
i
should
say
and
i
noticed
his
black
coat
his
short
hair
and
shaven
head
which
preserved
a
memory
of
his
priestly
ambition
and
understood
how
catholicism
had
seized
him
in
the
midst
of
the
vertigo
he
called
philosophy
and
i
noticed
his
lightless
eyes
and
his
complexion
and
understood
how
she
had
failed
to
do
more
than
hold
him
on
the
margin
and
i
was
full
of
an
anguish
of
pity
may
be
he
went
on
the
angels
whose
hearts
are
shadows
of
the
divine
heart
and
whose
bodies
are
made
of
the
divine
intellect
may
come
to
where
their
longing
is
always
by
a
thirst
for
the
divine
ecstasy
the
immortal
fire
that
is
in
passion
in
hope
in
desire
in
dreams
but
we
whose
hearts
perish
every
moment
and
whose
bodies
melt
away
like
a
sigh
must
bow
and
obey
i
went
nearer
to
him
and
said
and
repentance
will
make
you
like
other
no
he
said
am
not
among
those
for
whom
christ
died
and
this
is
why
i
must
be
hidden
i
have
a
leprosy
that
even
eternity
can
not
cure
i
have
seen
the
whole
and
how
can
i
come
again
to
believe
that
a
part
is
the
whole
i
have
lost
my
soul
because
i
have
looked
out
of
the
eyes
of
the
suddenly
i
saw
or
imagined
that
i
saw
the
room
darken
and
faint
figures
robed
in
purple
and
lifting
faint
torches
with
arms
that
gleamed
like
silver
bending
above
owen
aherne
and
i
saw
or
imagined
that
i
saw
drops
as
of
burning
gum
fall
from
the
torches
and
a
heavy
purple
smoke
as
of
incense
come
pouring
from
the
flames
and
sweeping
about
us
owen
aherne
more
happy
than
i
who
have
been
half
initiated
into
the
order
of
the
alchemical
rose
and
protected
perhaps
by
his
great
piety
had
sunk
again
into
dejection
and
listlessness
and
saw
none
of
these
things
but
my
knees
shook
under
me
for
the
figures
were
less
faint
every
moment
and
now
i
could
hear
the
hissing
of
the
gum
in
the
torches
they
did
not
appear
to
see
me
for
their
eyes
were
upon
owen
aherne
now
and
again
i
could
hear
them
sigh
as
though
with
sorrow
for
his
sorrow
and
presently
i
heard
words
which
i
could
not
understand
except
that
they
were
words
of
sorrow
and
sweet
as
though
immortal
was
talking
to
immortal
then
one
of
them
waved
her
torch
and
all
the
torches
waved
and
for
a
moment
it
was
as
though
some
great
bird
made
of
flames
had
fluttered
its
plumage
and
a
voice
cried
as
from
far
up
in
the
air
has
charged
even
his
angels
with
folly
and
they
also
bow
and
obey
but
let
your
heart
mingle
with
our
hearts
which
are
wrought
of
divine
ecstasy
and
your
body
with
our
bodies
which
are
wrought
of
divine
and
at
that
cry
i
understood
that
the
order
of
the
alchemical
rose
was
not
of
this
earth
and
that
it
was
still
seeking
over
this
earth
for
whatever
souls
it
could
gather
within
its
glittering
net
and
when
all
the
faces
turned
towards
me
and
i
saw
the
mild
eyes
and
the
unshaken
eyelids
i
was
full
of
terror
and
thought
they
were
about
to
fling
their
torches
upon
me
so
that
all
i
held
dear
all
that
bound
me
to
spiritual
and
social
order
would
be
burnt
up
and
my
soul
left
naked
and
shivering
among
the
winds
that
blow
from
beyond
this
world
and
from
beyond
the
stars
and
then
a
faint
voice
cried
do
you
fly
from
our
torches
that
were
made
out
of
the
trees
under
which
christ
wept
in
the
garden
of
gethsemane
why
do
you
fly
from
our
torches
that
were
made
out
of
sweet
wood
after
it
had
perished
from
the
world
and
come
to
us
who
made
it
of
old
times
with
our
breath
it
was
not
until
the
door
of
the
house
had
closed
behind
my
flight
and
the
noise
of
the
street
was
breaking
on
my
ears
that
i
came
back
to
myself
and
to
a
little
of
my
courage
and
i
have
never
dared
to
pass
the
house
of
owen
aherne
from
that
day
even
though
i
believe
him
to
have
been
driven
into
some
distant
country
by
the
spirits
whose
name
is
legion
and
whose
throne
is
in
the
indefinite
abyss
and
whom
he
obeys
and
can
not
see
the
adoration
of
the
magi
i
was
sitting
reading
late
into
the
night
a
little
after
my
last
meeting
with
aherne
when
i
heard
a
light
knocking
on
my
front
door
i
found
upon
the
doorstep
three
very
old
men
with
stout
sticks
in
their
hands
who
said
they
had
been
told
i
should
be
up
and
about
and
that
they
were
to
tell
me
important
things
i
brought
them
into
my
study
and
when
the
peacock
curtains
had
closed
behind
us
i
set
their
chairs
for
them
close
to
the
fire
for
i
saw
that
the
frost
was
on
their
of
frieze
and
upon
the
long
beards
that
flowed
almost
to
their
waists
they
took
off
their
and
leaned
over
the
fire
warming
their
hands
and
i
saw
that
their
clothes
had
much
of
the
country
of
our
time
but
a
little
also
as
it
seemed
to
me
of
the
town
life
of
a
more
courtly
time
when
they
had
warmed
themselves
and
they
warmed
themselves
i
thought
less
because
of
the
cold
of
the
night
than
because
of
a
pleasure
in
warmth
for
the
sake
of
warmth
they
turned
towards
me
so
that
the
light
of
the
lamp
fell
full
upon
their
faces
and
told
the
story
i
am
about
to
tell
now
one
talked
and
now
another
and
they
often
interrupted
one
another
with
a
desire
like
that
of
countrymen
when
they
tell
a
story
to
leave
no
detail
untold
when
they
had
finished
they
made
me
take
notes
of
whatever
conversation
they
had
quoted
so
that
i
might
have
the
exact
words
and
got
up
to
go
when
i
asked
them
where
they
were
going
and
what
they
were
doing
and
by
what
names
i
should
call
them
they
would
tell
me
nothing
except
that
they
had
been
commanded
to
travel
over
ireland
continually
and
upon
foot
and
at
night
that
they
might
live
close
to
the
stones
and
the
trees
and
at
the
hours
when
the
immortals
are
awake
i
have
let
some
years
go
by
before
writing
out
this
story
for
i
am
always
in
dread
of
the
illusions
which
come
of
that
inquietude
of
the
veil
of
the
temple
which
mallarmé
considers
a
characteristic
of
our
times
and
only
write
it
now
because
i
have
grown
to
believe
that
there
is
no
dangerous
idea
which
does
not
become
less
dangerous
when
written
out
in
sincere
and
careful
english
the
three
old
men
were
three
brothers
who
had
lived
in
one
of
the
western
islands
from
their
early
manhood
and
had
cared
all
their
lives
for
nothing
except
for
those
classical
writers
and
old
gaelic
writers
who
expounded
an
heroic
and
simple
life
night
after
night
in
winter
gaelic
would
chant
old
poems
to
them
over
the
poteen
and
night
after
night
in
summer
when
the
gaelic
were
at
work
in
the
fields
or
away
at
the
fishing
they
would
read
to
one
another
virgil
and
homer
for
they
would
not
enjoy
in
solitude
but
as
the
ancients
enjoyed
at
last
a
man
who
told
them
he
was
michael
robartes
came
to
them
in
a
like
brandan
drawn
by
some
vision
and
called
by
some
voice
and
spoke
of
the
coming
again
of
the
gods
and
the
ancient
things
and
their
hearts
which
had
never
endured
the
body
and
pressure
of
our
time
but
only
of
distant
times
found
nothing
unlikely
in
anything
he
told
them
but
accepted
all
simply
and
were
happy
years
passed
and
one
day
when
the
oldest
of
the
old
men
who
travelled
in
his
youth
and
thought
sometimes
of
other
lands
looked
out
on
the
grey
waters
on
which
the
people
see
the
dim
outline
of
the
islands
of
the
young
the
happy
islands
where
the
gaelic
heroes
live
the
lives
of
phæacians
a
voice
came
out
of
the
air
over
the
waters
and
told
him
of
the
death
of
michael
robartes
they
were
still
mourning
when
the
next
oldest
of
the
old
men
fell
asleep
while
reading
out
the
fifth
eclogue
of
virgil
and
a
strange
voice
spoke
through
him
and
bid
them
set
out
for
paris
where
a
woman
lay
dying
who
would
reveal
to
them
the
secret
names
of
the
gods
which
can
be
perfectly
spoken
only
when
the
mind
is
steeped
in
certain
colours
and
certain
sounds
and
certain
odours
but
at
whose
perfect
speaking
the
immortals
cease
to
be
cries
and
shadows
and
walk
and
talk
with
one
like
men
and
women
they
left
their
island
at
first
much
troubled
at
all
they
saw
in
the
world
and
came
to
paris
and
there
the
youngest
met
a
person
in
a
dream
who
told
him
they
were
to
wander
about
at
hazard
until
those
who
had
been
guiding
their
footsteps
had
brought
them
to
a
street
and
a
house
whose
likeness
was
shown
him
in
the
dream
they
wandered
hither
and
thither
for
many
days
but
one
morning
they
came
into
some
narrow
and
shabby
streets
on
the
south
of
the
seine
where
women
with
pale
faces
and
untidy
hair
looked
at
them
out
of
the
windows
and
just
as
they
were
about
to
turn
back
because
wisdom
could
not
have
alighted
in
so
foolish
a
neighbourhood
they
came
to
the
street
and
the
house
of
the
dream
the
oldest
of
the
old
men
who
still
remembered
some
of
the
modern
languages
he
had
known
in
his
youth
went
up
to
the
door
and
knocked
but
when
he
had
knocked
the
next
in
age
to
him
said
it
was
not
a
good
house
and
could
not
be
the
house
they
were
looking
for
and
urged
him
to
ask
for
some
one
that
they
knew
was
not
there
and
go
away
the
door
was
opened
by
an
old
woman
who
said
you
are
her
three
kinsmen
from
ireland
she
has
been
expecting
you
all
the
old
men
looked
at
one
another
and
followed
her
upstairs
passing
doors
from
which
pale
and
untidy
women
thrust
out
their
heads
and
into
a
room
where
a
beautiful
woman
lay
asleep
in
a
bed
with
another
woman
sitting
by
her
the
old
woman
said
they
have
come
at
last
now
she
will
be
able
to
die
in
peace
and
went
out
have
been
deceived
by
devils
said
one
of
the
old
men
the
immortals
would
not
speak
through
a
woman
like
said
another
have
been
deceived
by
devils
and
we
must
go
away
said
the
third
have
been
deceived
by
devils
but
let
us
kneel
down
for
a
little
for
we
are
by
the
deathbed
of
one
that
has
been
they
knelt
down
and
the
woman
who
sat
by
the
bed
and
seemed
to
be
overcome
with
fear
and
awe
lowered
her
head
they
watched
for
a
little
the
face
upon
the
pillow
and
wondered
at
its
look
as
of
unquenchable
desire
and
at
the
refinement
of
the
vessel
in
which
so
malevolent
a
flame
had
burned
suddenly
the
second
oldest
of
them
crowed
like
a
cock
and
until
the
room
seemed
to
shake
with
the
crowing
the
woman
in
the
bed
still
slept
on
in
her
sleep
but
the
woman
who
sat
by
her
head
crossed
herself
and
grew
pale
and
the
youngest
of
the
old
men
cried
out
devil
has
gone
into
him
and
we
must
begone
or
it
will
go
into
us
before
they
could
rise
from
their
knees
a
resonant
chanting
voice
came
from
the
lips
that
had
crowed
and
said
am
not
a
devil
but
i
am
hermes
the
shepherd
of
the
dead
and
i
run
upon
the
errands
of
the
gods
and
you
have
heard
my
sign
that
has
been
my
sign
from
the
old
days
bow
down
before
her
from
whose
lips
the
secret
names
of
the
immortals
and
of
the
things
near
their
hearts
are
about
to
come
that
the
immortals
may
come
again
into
the
world
bow
down
and
understand
that
when
they
are
about
to
overthrow
the
things
that
are
and
bring
the
things
that
were
yesterday
they
have
no
one
to
help
them
but
one
whom
the
things
that
are
have
cast
out
bow
down
and
very
low
for
they
have
chosen
for
their
priestess
this
woman
in
whose
heart
all
follies
have
gathered
and
in
whose
body
all
desires
have
awaked
this
woman
who
has
been
driven
out
of
time
and
has
lain
upon
the
bosom
of
eternity
after
you
have
bowed
down
the
old
things
shall
be
again
and
another
argo
shall
carry
heroes
over
sea
and
another
achilles
beleaguer
another
the
voice
ended
with
a
sigh
and
immediately
the
old
man
awoke
out
of
sleep
and
said
a
voice
spoken
through
me
as
it
did
when
i
fell
asleep
over
my
virgil
or
have
i
only
been
asleep
the
oldest
of
them
said
voice
has
spoken
through
you
where
has
your
soul
been
while
the
voice
was
speaking
through
you
do
not
know
where
my
soul
has
been
but
i
dreamed
i
was
under
the
roof
of
a
manger
and
i
looked
down
and
i
saw
an
ox
and
an
ass
and
i
saw
a
red
cock
perching
on
the
and
a
woman
hugging
a
child
and
three
old
men
in
armour
studded
with
rubies
kneeling
with
their
heads
bowed
very
low
in
front
of
the
woman
and
the
child
while
i
was
looking
the
cock
crowed
and
a
man
with
wings
on
his
heels
swept
up
through
the
air
and
as
he
passed
me
cried
out
old
men
you
had
once
all
the
wisdom
of
the
i
do
not
understand
my
dream
or
what
it
would
have
us
do
but
you
who
have
heard
the
voice
out
of
the
wisdom
of
my
sleep
know
what
we
have
to
then
the
oldest
of
the
old
men
told
him
they
were
to
take
the
parchments
they
had
brought
with
them
out
of
their
pockets
and
spread
them
on
the
ground
when
they
had
spread
them
on
the
ground
they
took
out
of
their
pockets
their
pens
made
of
three
feathers
which
had
fallen
from
the
wing
of
the
old
eagle
that
is
believed
to
have
talked
of
wisdom
with
patrick
meant
i
think
said
the
youngest
as
he
put
their
by
the
side
of
the
rolls
of
parchment
when
people
are
good
the
world
likes
them
and
takes
possession
of
them
and
so
eternity
comes
through
people
who
are
not
good
or
who
have
been
forgotten
perhaps
christianity
was
good
and
the
world
liked
it
so
now
it
is
going
away
and
the
immortals
are
beginning
to
you
say
has
no
wisdom
said
the
oldest
if
there
are
many
immortals
there
can
not
be
only
one
then
the
woman
in
the
bed
sat
up
and
looked
about
her
with
wild
eyes
and
the
oldest
of
the
old
men
said
we
have
come
to
write
down
the
secret
names
and
at
his
words
a
look
of
great
joy
came
into
her
face
presently
she
began
to
speak
slowly
and
yet
eagerly
as
though
she
knew
she
had
but
a
little
while
to
live
and
in
the
gaelic
of
their
own
country
and
she
spoke
to
them
many
secret
powerful
names
and
of
the
colours
and
odours
and
weapons
and
instruments
of
music
and
instruments
of
handicraft
belonging
to
the
owners
of
those
names
but
most
about
the
sidhe
of
ireland
and
of
their
love
for
the
cauldron
and
the
whetstone
and
the
sword
and
the
spear
then
she
tossed
feebly
for
a
while
and
moaned
and
when
she
spoke
again
it
was
in
so
faint
a
murmur
that
the
woman
who
sat
by
the
bed
leaned
down
to
listen
and
while
she
was
listening
the
spirit
went
out
of
the
body
then
the
oldest
of
the
old
men
said
in
french
to
the
woman
who
was
still
bending
over
the
bed
must
have
been
yet
one
name
which
she
had
not
given
us
for
she
murmured
a
name
while
the
spirit
was
going
out
of
the
body
and
the
woman
said
was
but
murmuring
over
the
name
of
a
symbolist
painter
she
was
fond
of
he
used
to
go
to
something
he
called
the
black
mass
and
it
was
he
who
taught
her
to
see
visions
and
to
hear
voices
she
met
him
for
the
first
time
a
few
months
ago
and
we
have
had
no
peace
from
that
day
because
of
her
talk
about
visions
and
about
voices
why
it
was
only
last
night
that
i
dreamed
i
saw
a
man
with
a
red
beard
and
red
hair
and
dressed
in
red
standing
by
my
bedside
he
held
a
rose
in
one
hand
and
tore
it
in
pieces
with
the
other
hand
and
the
petals
drifted
about
the
room
and
became
beautiful
people
who
began
to
dance
slowly
when
i
woke
up
i
was
all
in
a
heat
with
this
is
all
the
old
men
told
me
and
when
i
think
of
their
speech
and
of
their
silence
of
their
coming
and
of
their
going
i
am
almost
persuaded
that
had
i
gone
out
of
the
house
after
they
had
gone
out
of
it
i
should
have
found
no
footsteps
on
the
snow
they
may
for
all
i
or
any
man
can
say
have
been
themselves
immortals
immortal
demons
come
to
put
an
untrue
story
into
my
mind
for
some
purpose
i
do
not
understand
whatever
they
were
i
have
turned
into
a
pathway
which
will
lead
me
from
them
and
from
the
order
of
the
alchemical
rose
i
no
longer
live
an
elaborate
and
haughty
life
but
seek
to
lose
myself
among
the
prayers
and
the
sorrows
of
the
multitude
i
pray
best
in
poor
chapels
where
the
frieze
coats
brush
by
me
as
i
kneel
and
when
i
pray
against
the
demons
i
repeat
a
prayer
which
was
made
i
know
not
how
many
centuries
ago
to
help
some
poor
gaelic
man
or
woman
who
had
suffered
with
a
suffering
like

john

two
early
stories
by
kind
permission
of
fisher
having
been
persuaded
somewhat
against
my
judgment
to
include
these
early
stories
i
have
read
them
for
the
first
time
these
many
years
they
have
come
to
interest
me
very
deeply
for
i
am
something
of
an
astrologer
and
can
see
in
them
a
young
man
was
i
and
we
irish
ripen
slowly
born
when
the
was
on
the
horizon
at
pains
to
overcome
saturn
in
hour
just
as
i
can
see
in
much
that
follows
his
struggle
with
the
still
moon
and
at
last
as
i
think
the
summons
of
the
prouder
sun
sligo
where
i
had
lived
as
a
child
and
spent
some
months
or
weeks
of
every
year
till
long
after
is
ballah
and

is
at

there
and
he
who
gave
me
all
of
sherman
that
was
not
born
at
the
rising
of
the
has
still
the
bronze
upon
his
face
and
is
at
this
moment
it
may
be
in
his
walled
garden
wondering
as
he
did
twenty
years
ago
whether
he
will
ever
mend
the
broken
glass
of
the
conservatory

john

leaves
ballah
i
in
the
west
of
ireland
on
the
of
december
in
the
town
of
ballah
in
the
imperial
hotel
there
was
a
single
guest
clerical
and
youthful
with
the
exception
of
a
stray
commercial
traveller
who
stopped
once
for
a
night
there
had
been
nobody
for
a
whole
month
but
this
guest
and
now
he
was
thinking
of
going
away
the
town
full
enough
in
summer
of
trout
and
salmon
fishers
slept
all
winter
like
the
bears
on
the
evening
of
the
of
december
in
the
of
the
imperial
hotel
there
was
nobody
but
this
guest
the
guest
was
irritated
it
had
rained
all
day
and
now
that
it
was
clearing
up
night
had
almost
fallen
he
had
packed
his
portmanteau
his
stockings
his
his
razor
his
dress
shoes
were
each
in
their
corner
and
now
he
had
nothing
to
do
he
had
tried
the
paper
that
was
lying
on
the
table
he
did
not
agree
with
its
politics
the
waiter
was
playing
an
accordion
in
a
little
room
over
the
stairs
the
irritation
increased
for
the
more
he
thought
about
it
the
more
he
perceived
that
the
accordion
was
badly
played
there
was
a
piano
in
the
he
sat
down
at
it
and
played
the
tune
correctly
as
loudly
as
possible
the
waiter
took
no
notice
he
did
not
know
that
he
was
being
played
for
he
was
wholly
absorbed
in
his
own
playing
and
besides
he
was
old
obstinate
and
deaf
the
guest
could
stand
it
no
longer
he
rang
for
the
waiter
and
then
remembering
that
he
did
not
need
anything
went
out
before
he
came
he
went
through
street
and
lane
and
turned
down
by
the
burnt
house
at
the
corner
of
the
picking
his
way
towards
the
bridge
the
town
was
dripping
but
the
rain
was
almost
over
the
large
drops
fell
seldomer
and
seldomer
into
the
puddles
it
was
the
hour
of
ducks
three
or
four
had
squeezed
themselves
under
a
gate
and
were
now
splashing
about
in
the
gutter
of
the
main
street
there
was
scarcely
anyone
abroad
once
or
twice
a
countryman
went
by
in
yellow
gaiters
covered
with
mud
and
looked
at
the
guest
once
an
old
woman
with
a
basket
of
clothes
recognizing
the
protestant
made
a
low
curtsey
the
clouds
gradually
drifted
away
the
twilight
deepened
and
the
stars
came
out
the
guest
having
bought
some
cigarettes
had
spread
his
waterproof
on
the
parapet
of
the
bridge
and
was
now
leaning
his
elbows
upon
it
looking
at
the
river
and
feeling
at
last
quite
tranquil
his
meditations
he
repeated
to
himself
were
plated
with
silver
by
the
stars
the
water
slid
noiselessly
and
one
or
two
of
the
larger
stars
made
little
roadways
of
fire
into
the
darkness
the
light
from
a
distant
casement
made
also
its
roadway
once
or
twice
a
fish
leaped
along
the
banks
were
the
vague
shadows
of
houses
seeming
like
phantoms
gathering
to
drink
yes
he
felt
now
quite
contented
with
the
world
amidst
his
enjoyment
of
the
shadows
and
the
river
a
veritable
festival
of
silence
was
mixed
pleasantly
the
knowledge
that
as
he
leant
there
with
the
light
of
a
neighbouring
flickering
faintly
on
his
refined
form
and
nervous
face
and
glancing
from
the
little
medal
of
some
anglican
order
that
hung
upon
his
he
must
have
seemed
if
there
had
been
any
to
witness
a
being
of
a
different
kind
to
the
inhabitants
at
once
rough
and
conventional
of
this
town
between
these
two
feelings
the
unworldly
and
the
worldly
tossed
a
leaping
wave
of
perfect
enjoyment
how
pleasantly
conscious
of
his
own
identity
it
made
him
when
he
thought
how
he
and
not
those
whose
birthright
it
was
felt
most
the
beauty
of
these
shadows
and
this
river
for
him
who
had
read
much
seen
operas
and
plays
known
religious
experiences
and
written
verse
to
a
waterfall
in
switzerland
and
not
for
those
who
dwelt
upon
its
borders
for
their
whole
lives
did
this
river
raise
a
tumult
of
images
and
wonders
what
meaning
it
had
for
them
he
could
not
imagine
some
meaning
surely
it
must
have
as
he
gazed
out
into
the
darkness
spinning
a
web
of
thoughts
from
himself
to
the
river
from
the
river
to
himself
he
saw
with
a
corner
of
his
eye
a
spot
of
red
light
moving
in
the
air
at
the
other
end
of
the
bridge
he
turned
towards
it
it
came
closer
and
closer
there
appearing
behind
it
the
while
a
man
and
a
cigar
the
man
carried
in
one
hand
a
mass
of
covered
with
hooks
and
in
the
other
a
tin
porringer
full
of
bait
evening
evening
answered
the
guest
taking
his
elbows
off
the
parapet
and
looking
in
a
preoccupied
way
at
the
man
with
the
hooks
it
was
only
gradually
he
remembered
that
he
was
in
ballah
among
the
barbarians
for
his
mind
had
strayed
from
the
last
evening
flies
making
circles
on
the
water
beneath
to
the
song
against
little
in
looking
down
at
the
stone
parapet
he
considered
a
moment
and
then
burst
out
how
do
you
stand
this
place
you
who
have
thoughts
above
mere
eating
and
sleeping
and
are
not
always
grinding
at
the
stubble
mill
here
everybody
lives
in
the
eighteenth
century
the
squalid
century
well
i
am
going
you
know
thank
heaven
i
am
done
with
your
grey
streets
and
grey
minds
the
curate
must
come
home
sick
or
well
i
have
a
religious
essay
to
write
and
besides
i
should
die
think
of
that
old
fellow
at
the
corner
there
our
most
important
parishioner
there
are
no
more
hairs
on
his
head
than
thoughts
in
his
skull
to
merely
look
at
him
is
to
rob
life
of
its
dignity
then
there
is
nothing
in
the
shops
but
and
prizes
excellent
no
doubt
for
anyone
who
has
not
had
to
read
as
many
as
i
have
such
a
choir
such
rain
need
some
occupation
peculiar
to
the
place
said
the
other
baiting
his
hooks
with
worms
out
of
the
little
porringer
catch
eels
you
should
set
some
too
you
bait
them
with
worms
in
this
way
and
put
them
among
the
weeds
at
the
edge
of
the
river
in
the
morning
you
find
an
eel
or
two
if
you
have
good
fortune
turning
round
and
round
and
making
the
weeds
sway
i
shall
catch
a
great
many
after
this
a
suggestion
do
you
mean
to
stay
here
said
howard
your
mind
rots
like
our
most
important
no
to
be
quite
frank
with
you
replied
the
other
have
some
good
looks
and
shall
try
to
turn
them
to
account
by
going
away
from
here
pretty
soon
and
trying
to
persuade
some
girl
with
money
to
fall
in
love
with
me
i
shall
not
be
altogether
a
bad
match
you
see
because
after
she
has
made
me
a
little
prosperous
my
uncle
will
die
and
make
me
much
more
so
i
wish
to
be
able
always
to
remain
a
lounger
yes
i
shall
marry
money
my
mother
has
set
her
heart
on
it
and
i
am
not
you
see
the
kind
of
person
who
falls
in
love
inconveniently
for
the
present
are
vegetating
interrupted
the
other
i
am
seeing
the
world
in
your
big
towns
a
man
finds
his
minority
and
knows
nothing
outside
its
border
he
knows
only
the
people
like
himself
but
here
one
chats
with
the
whole
world
in
a
walk
for
every
man
one
meets
is
a
class
the
knowledge
i
am
picking
up
may
be
useful
to
me
when
i
enter
the
great
cities
and
their
ignorance
but
i
have
lines
to
set
come
with
me
i
would
ask
you
home
but
you
and
my
mother
you
know
do
not
get
on
could
not
live
with
anyone
i
did
not
believe
in
said
howard
are
so
different
from
me
you
can
live
with
mere
facts
and
that
is
why
i
suppose
your
schemes
are
so
mercenary
before
this
beautiful
river
these
stars
these
great
purple
shadows
do
you
not
feel
like
an
insect
in
a
flower
as
for
me
i
also
have
planned
my
future
not
too
near
or
too
far
from
a
great
city
i
see
myself
in
a
cottage
with
diamond
panes
sitting
by
the
fire
there
are
books
everywhere
and
etchings
on
the
wall
on
the
table
is
a
manuscript
essay
on
some
religious
matter
perhaps
i
shall
marry
some
day
probably
not
for
i
shall
ask
so
much
certainly
i
shall
not
marry
for
money
for
i
hold
that
when
we
have
lost
the
directness
and
sincerity
of
our
nature
we
have
no
compass
if
we
once
break
it
the
world
grows
said
sherman
briskly
have
baited
the
last
hook
your
schemes
suit
you
but
a
sluggish
fellow
like
me
poor
devil
who
wishes
to
lounge
through
the
world
would
find
them
they
parted
sherman
to
set
his
lines
and
howard
to
his
hotel
in
high
spirits
for
it
seemed
to
him
he
had
been
eloquent
the
which
opened
on
the
street
was
lighted
up
a
few
young
men
came
round
to
play
sometimes
he
went
in
for
among
these
provincial
youths
he
felt
distinguished
besides
he
was
a
really
good
player
as
he
came
in
one
of
the
players
missed
and
swore
howard
reproved
him
with
a
look
he
joined
the
play
for
a
time
and
then
catching
sight
through
a
distant
door
of
the
wife
putting
a
kettle
on
the
hob
he
hurried
off
and
drawing
a
chair
to
the
fire
began
one
of
those
long
gossips
about
affairs
peculiar
to
the
cloth
as
sherman
having
set
his
lines
returned
home
he
passed
a
a
and
in
one
the
only
shop
in
town
except
that
remained
open
the
tobacconist
was
standing
in
his
door
and
recognizing
one
who
dealt
consistently
with
a
rival
at
the
other
end
of
the
town
muttered
goes
that
jack
dreams
been
fishing
most
likely
ugh
sherman
paused
for
a
moment
as
he
repassed
the
bridge
and
looked
at
the
water
on
which
now
a
and
crescent
moon
was
shining
dimly
how
full
of
memories
it
was
to
him
what
playmates
and
boyish
adventures
did
it
not
bring
to
mind
to
him
it
seemed
to
say
near
to
me
as
to
howard
it
had
said
yonder
to
those
other
joys
and
other
sceneries
i
have
told
you
it
bade
him
who
loved
stay
still
and
dream
and
gave
flying
feet
to
him
who
imagined
ii
the
house
where
sherman
and
his
mother
lived
was
one
of
those
bare
houses
so
common
in
country
towns
their
dashed
fronts
mounting
above
empty
pavements
have
a
kind
of
dignity
in
their
utilitarianism
they
seem
to
say
has
not
made
us
nor
ever
do
its
caprices
pass
our
on
every
basement
window
is
the
same
dingy
wire
blind
on
every
door
the
same
brass
knocker
custom
everywhere
much
the
longer
the
blinds
seem
to
say
eyes
glanced
through
and
the
knockers
to
murmur
fingers
lifted
no
row
was
in
no
manner
peculiar
among
its
twenty
fellows
the
chairs
in
the
facing
the
street
were
of
heavy
mahogany
with
horsehair
cushions
worn
at
the
corners
on
the
round
table
was
commentary
on
the
new
testament
laid
like
the
spokes
of
a
wheel
on
a
of
american
oilcloth
with
stamped
japanese
figures
half
worn
away
the
room
was
seldom
used
for
sherman
was
solitary
because
silent
in
this
room
the
dressmaker
sat
twice
a
year
and
here
the
wife
used
every
month
or
so
to
drink
a
cup
of
tea
it
was
quite
clean
there
was
not
a
on
the
mirror
and
all
summer
the
fern
in
the
grate
was
constantly
changed
behind
this
room
and
overlooking
the
garden
was
the
parlour
where
chairs
took
the
place
of
mahogany
sherman
had
lived
here
with
his
mother
all
his
life
and
their
old
servant
hardly
remembered
having
lived
anywhere
else
and
soon
she
would
absolutely
cease
to
remember
the
world
she
knew
before
she
saw
the
four
walls
of
this
house
for
every
day
she
forgot
something
fresh
the
son
was
almost
thirty
the
mother
fifty
and
the
servant
near
seventy
every
year
they
had
two
hundred
pounds
among
them
and
once
a
year
the
son
got
a
new
suit
of
clothes
and
went
into
the
to
look
at
himself
in
the
mirror
on
the
morning
of
the
of
december
sherman
was
down
before
her
son
a
spare
woman
with
somewhat
thin
lips
tightly
closed
as
with
silent
people
and
eyes
at
once
gentle
and
distrustful
tempering
the
hardness
of
the
lips
she
helped
the
servant
to
set
the
table
and
then
for
her
ideas
would
not
allow
her
to
rest
began
to
knit
often
interrupting
her
knitting
to
go
into
the
kitchen
or
to
listen
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
at
last
hearing
a
sound
upstairs
she
put
the
eggs
down
to
boil
muttering
the
while
and
began
again
to
knit
when
her
son
appeared
she
received
him
with
a
smile
again
mother
he
said
young
should
sleep
she
answered
for
to
her
he
seemed
still
a
boy
she
had
finished
her
breakfast
some
time
before
the
young
man
and
because
it
would
have
appeared
very
wrong
to
her
to
leave
the
table
she
sat
on
knitting
behind
the
an
industry
the
benefit
of
which
was
felt
by
many
poor
children
almost
the
only
neighbours
she
had
a
good
word
for
said
the
young
man
presently
friend
the
is
off
good
are
you
so
hard
on
him
he
talked
intelligently
when
here
i
thought
answered
her
son
do
not
like
his
theology
she
replied
his
way
of
running
about
and
flirting
with
this
body
and
that
body
nor
his
way
of
chattering
while
he
buttons
and
unbuttons
his
forget
he
is
a
man
of
the
great
world
and
has
about
him
a
manner
that
must
seem
strange
to
he
might
do
very
well
she
answered
one
of
those
carton
girls
at
the
eldest
girl
is
a
good
girl
replied
her
son
looks
down
on
us
all
and
thinks
herself
intellectual
she
went
on
remember
when
girls
were
content
with
their
catechism
and
their
bibles
and
a
little
practice
at
the
piano
maybe
for
an
accomplishment
what
does
any
one
want
more
it
is
all
used
to
like
her
as
a
child
said
the
young
man
like
all
sherman
having
finished
his
breakfast
took
a
book
of
travels
in
one
hand
and
a
trowel
in
the
other
and
went
out
into
the
garden
having
looked
under
the
parlour
window
for
the
first
tulip
shoots
he
went
down
to
the
further
end
and
began
covering
some
for
forcing
he
had
not
been
long
at
work
when
the
servant
brought
him
a
letter
there
was
a
stone
roller
at
one
side
of
the
grass
plot
he
sat
down
upon
it
and
taking
the
letter
between
his
finger
and
thumb
began
looking
at
it
with
an
air
that
said
i
know
what
you
he
remained
long
thus
without
opening
it
the
book
lying
beside
him
on
the
roller
the
garden
the
letter
the
book
you
have
there
the
three
symbols
of
his
life
every
morning
he
worked
in
that
garden
among
the
sights
and
sounds
of
nature
month
by
month
he
planted
and
hoed
and
dug
there
in
the
middle
he
had
set
a
hedge
that
divided
the
garden
in
two
above
the
hedge
were
flowers
below
it
vegetables
at
the
furthest
end
from
the
house
lapping
broken
masonry
full
of
wallflowers
the
river
said
month
after
month
to
all
upon
its
banks
he
dined
at
two
with
perfect
regularity
and
in
the
afternoon
went
out
to
shoot
or
walk
at
twilight
he
set
later
on
he
read
he
had
not
many
books
a
shakespeare
mungo
travels
a
few
novels
and
a
volume
on
etiquette
he
seldom
varied
his
occupations
he
had
no
profession
the
town
talked
of
it
they
said
lives
upon
his
mother
and
were
very
angry
they
never
let
him
see
this
however
for
it
was
generally
understood
he
would
be
a
dangerous
fellow
to
rouse
but
there
was
an
uncle
from
whom
sherman
had
expectations
who
sometimes
wrote
remonstrating
sherman
resented
these
letters
for
she
was
afraid
of
her
son
going
away
to
seek
his
fortune
perhaps
even
in
america
now
this
matter
preyed
somewhat
on
sherman
for
three
years
or
so
he
had
been
trying
to
make
his
mind
up
and
come
to
some
decision
sometimes
when
reading
he
would
start
and
press
his
lips
together
and
knit
his
brows
for
a
moment
it
will
now
be
seen
why
the
garden
the
book
and
the
letter
were
the
three
symbols
of
his
life
summing
up
as
they
did
his
love
of
doings
his
meditations
his
anxieties
his
life
in
the
garden
had
granted
serenity
to
his
forehead
the
reading
of
his
few
books
had
filled
his
eyes
with
reverie
and
the
feeling
that
he
was
not
quite
a
good
citizen
had
given
a
slight
and
occasional
trembling
to
his
lips
he
opened
the
letter
its
contents
were
what
he
had
long
expected
his
uncle
offered
to
take
him
into
his
office
he
laid
it
spread
out
before
him
a
foot
on
each
margin
right
and
left
and
looked
at
it
turning
the
matter
over
and
over
in
his
mind
would
he
go
would
he
stay
he
did
not
like
the
idea
much
the
lounger
in
him
did
not
enjoy
the
thought
of
london
gradually
his
mind
wandered
away
into
scheming
infinite
scheming
what
would
he
do
if
he
went
what
would
he
do
if
he
did
not
go
a
beetle
attracted
by
the
faint
sunlight
had
crawled
out
of
its
hole
it
saw
the
paper
and
crept
on
to
it
the
better
to
catch
the
sunlight
sherman
saw
the
beetle
but
his
mind
was
not
occupied
with
it
i
tell
mary
carton
he
was
thinking
mary
had
long
been
his
adviser
and
friend
she
was
indeed
adviser
yes
he
would
ask
her
what
to
do
then
again
he
thought
no
he
would
decide
for
himself
the
beetle
began
to
move
it
goes
off
the
paper
by
the
top
i
will
ask
her
if
by
the
bottom
i
will
the
beetle
went
off
by
the
top
he
got
up
with
an
air
of
decision
and
went
into
the
and
began
sorting
seeds
and
picking
out
the
light
ones
sometimes
stopping
to
watch
a
spider
for
he
knew
he
must
wait
till
the
afternoon
to
see
mary
carton
the
was
a
favourite
place
with
him
he
often
read
there
and
watched
the
spiders
in
the
corners
at
dinner
he
was
preoccupied
he
said
you
much
mind
if
we
went
away
from
this
have
often
told
you
she
answered
do
not
like
one
place
better
than
another
i
like
them
all
equally
after
dinner
he
went
again
into
the
this
time
he
did
not
sort
seeds
only
watched
the
spiders
iii
towards
evening
he
went
out
the
pale
sunshine
of
winter
flickered
on
his
path
the
wind
blew
the
straws
about
he
grew
more
and
more
melancholy
a
dog
of
his
acquaintance
was
chasing
rabbits
in
a
field
he
had
never
been
known
to
catch
one
and
since
his
youth
had
never
seen
one
for
he
was
almost
wholly
blind
they
were
his
form
of
the
eternal
chimera
the
dog
left
the
field
and
followed
with
a
friendly
sniff
they
came
together
to
the
rectory
mary
carton
was
not
in
there
was
a
practice
in
the
they
went
thither
a
child
of
four
or
five
with
a
swelling
on
its
face
was
sitting
under
a
wall
opposite
the
school
door
waiting
to
make
faces
at
the
protestant
children
as
they
came
out
catching
sight
of
the
dog
she
seemed
to
debate
in
her
mind
whether
to
throw
a
stone
at
it
or
call
it
to
her
she
threw
the
stone
and
made
it
run
in
after
times
he
remembered
all
these
things
as
though
they
were
of
importance
he
opened
the
latched
green
door
and
went
in
about
twenty
children
were
singing
in
shrill
voices
standing
in
a
row
at
the
further
end
at
the
harmonium
he
recognised
mary
carton
who
nodded
to
him
and
went
on
with
her
playing
the
whitewashed
walls
were
covered
with
glazed
prints
of
animals
at
the
further
end
was
a
large
map
of
europe
by
a
fire
at
the
near
end
was
a
table
with
the
remains
of
tea
this
tea
was
an
idea
of
they
had
tea
and
cake
first
afterwards
the
singing
the
floor
was
covered
with
crumbs
the
fire
was
burning
brightly
sherman
sat
down
beside
it
a
child
with
a
great
deal
of
oil
in
her
hair
was
sitting
on
the
end
of
a
form
at
the
other
side
she
whispered
have
been
sent
away
at
any
rate
they
are
further
from
the
fire
they
have
to
be
near
the
harmonium
i
would
not
sing
do
you
like
hymns
i
will
you
have
a
cup
of
tea
i
can
make
it
quite
well
see
i
did
not
spill
a
drop
have
you
enough
milk
it
was
a
cup
full
of
milk
tea
there
is
a
mouse
carrying
away
a
crumb
hush
they
sat
there
the
child
watching
the
mouse
sherman
pondering
on
his
letter
until
the
music
ceased
and
the
children
came
tramping
down
the
room
the
mouse
having
fled
hostess
got
up
with
a
sigh
and
went
out
with
the
others
mary
carton
closed
the
harmonium
and
came
towards
sherman
her
face
and
all
her
movements
showed
a
gentle
decision
of
character
her
glance
was
serene
her
features
regular
her
figure
at
the
same
time
ample
and
beautifully
moulded
her
dress
plain
yet
not
without
a
certain
air
of
distinction
in
a
different
society
she
would
have
had
many
suitors
but
she
was
of
a
type
that
in
country
towns
does
not
get
married
at
all
its
beauty
is
too
lacking
in
pink
and
white
its
nature
in
that
small
assertiveness
admired
for
character
by
the
uninstructed
elsewhere
she
would
have
known
her
own
beauty
as
it
is
right
that
all
the
beautiful
should
and
have
learnt
how
to
display
it
to
add
gesture
to
her
calm
and
more
of
mirth
and
smiles
to
her
grave
cheerfulness
as
it
was
her
manner
was
much
older
than
herself
she
sat
down
by
sherman
with
the
air
of
an
old
friend
they
had
long
been
accustomed
to
consult
together
on
every
matter
they
were
such
good
friends
they
had
never
fallen
in
love
with
each
other
perfect
love
and
perfect
friendship
are
indeed
incompatible
for
the
one
is
a
battlefield
where
shadows
war
beside
the
combatants
and
the

said
mary
carton
warming
her
hands
at
the
fire
have
had
a
troublesome
day
did
you
come
to
help
me
teach
the
children
to
sing
it
was
good
of
you
you
were
just
too
he
answered
have
come
to
be
your
pupil
i
am
always
your
and
a
most
disobedient
advise
me
this
time
at
any
rate
my
uncle
has
written
offering
me
a
hundred
pounds
a
year
to
begin
with
in
his
london
office
am
i
to
go
know
quite
well
my
answer
she
said
i
do
not
why
should
i
go
i
am
contented
here
i
am
now
making
my
garden
ready
for
spring
later
on
there
will
be
trout
fishing
and
saunters
by
the
edge
of
the
river
in
the
evening
when
the
bats
are
flickering
about
in
july
there
will
be
races
i
enjoy
the
bustle
i
enjoy
life
here
when
anything
annoys
me
i
keep
away
from
it
that
is
all
you
know
i
am
always
busy
i
have
occupation
and
friends
and
am
quite
is
a
great
loss
to
many
of
us
but
you
must
go
john
she
said
you
know
you
will
be
old
some
day
and
perhaps
when
the
vitality
of
youth
is
gone
you
will
feel
that
your
life
is
empty
and
find
that
you
are
too
old
to
change
it
and
you
will
give
up
perhaps
trying
to
be
happy
and
likeable
and
become
as
the
rest
are
i
think
i
can
see
you
she
said
with
a
laugh
hypochondriac
like
gorman
the
retired
excise
officer
or
with
a
red
nose
like
stephens
or
growing
like
peters
the
elderly
cattle
merchant
who
starves
his
were
bad
material
to
begin
with
he
answered
besides
i
can
not
take
my
mother
away
with
me
at
her
age
and
i
can
not
leave
her
annoyance
it
may
be
she
answered
soon
be
forgotten
you
will
be
able
to
give
her
many
more
comforts
we
women
we
all
like
to
be
dressed
well
and
have
pleasant
rooms
to
sit
in
and
a
young
man
at
your
age
should
not
be
idle
you
must
go
away
from
this
little
backward
place
we
shall
miss
you
but
you
are
clever
and
must
go
and
work
with
other
men
and
have
your
talents
emulous
you
would
have
me
perhaps
i
shall
be
some
day
meanwhile
i
only
wish
to
stay
here
with
my
she
went
over
to
the
window
and
looked
out
with
her
face
turned
from
him
the
evening
light
cast
a
long
shadow
behind
her
on
the
floor
after
some
moments
she
said
see
people
ploughing
on
the
slope
of
the
hill
there
are
people
working
on
a
house
to
the
right
everywhere
there
are
people
busy
and
with
a
slight
tremble
in
her
voice
she
added
john
nowhere
are
there
any
doing
what
they
wish
one
has
to
think
of
so
many
things
of
duty
and
i
know
you
were
so
coming
towards
him
with
a
smile
she
said
more
did
i
perhaps
but
sometimes
the
self
in
one
is
very
strong
one
has
to
think
a
great
deal
and
reason
with
it
yet
i
try
hard
to
lose
myself
in
things
about
me
these
children
now
i
often
lie
awake
thinking
about
them
that
child
who
was
talking
to
you
is
often
on
my
mind
i
do
not
know
what
will
happen
to
her
she
makes
me
unhappy
i
am
afraid
she
is
not
a
good
child
at
all
i
am
afraid
she
is
not
taught
well
at
home
i
try
hard
to
be
gentle
and
patient
with
her
i
am
a
little
displeased
with
myself
so
i
have
lectured
you
there
i
have
made
my
confession
but
she
added
taking
one
of
his
hands
in
both
hers
and
reddening
must
go
away
you
must
not
be
idle
you
will
gain
as
she
stood
there
with
bright
eyes
the
light
of
evening
about
her
sherman
for
perhaps
the
first
time
saw
how
beautiful
she
was
and
was
flattered
by
her
interest
for
the
first
time
also
her
presence
did
not
make
him
at
peace
with
the
world
you
be
an
obedient
pupil
know
so
much
more
than
i
do
he
answered
are
so
much
wiser
i
will
write
to
my
uncle
and
agree
to
his
you
must
go
home
she
said
must
not
keep
your
mother
waiting
for
her
tea
there
i
have
raked
the
fire
out
we
must
not
forget
to
lock
the
door
behind
as
they
stood
on
the
doorstep
the
wind
blew
a
whirl
of
dead
leaves
about
them
are
my
old
thoughts
he
said
they
are
all
they
walked
together
silently
at
the
vicarage
he
left
her
and
went
homeward
the
deserted
at
the
corner
of
two
roads
the
house
that
had
been
burnt
hollow
ten
years
before
and
still
lifted
its
blackened
beams
the
straggling
and
leafless
rising
above
garden
walls
the
church
where
he
was
christened
these
of
his
infancy
seemed
to
nod
and
shake
their
heads
over
him
he
said
hurriedly
entering
the
room
are
going
to
you
wish
i
always
knew
you
would
be
a
rolling
stone
she
answered
and
went
out
to
tell
the
servant
that
as
soon
as
she
had
finished
the
washing
they
must
pack
up
everything
for
they
were
going
to
london
we
must
pack
up
said
the
old
peasant
she
did
not
stop
peeling
the
onion
in
her
hand
she
had
not
comprehended
in
the
middle
of
the
night
she
suddenly
started
up
in
bed
with
a
pale
face
and
a
prayer
to
the
virgin
whose
image
hung
over
her
head
she
had
now
comprehended
iv
on
january
the
about
two
in
the
afternoon
sherman
sat
on
the
deck
of
the
steamer
enjoying
a
period
of
sunshine
between
two
showers
the
steamer
was
a
it
had
been
his
wish
to
travel
by
some
more
expensive
route
but
his
mother
with
her
ideas
of
duty
would
not
hear
of
it
and
now
as
he
foresaw
was
extremely
uncomfortable
below
while
he
who
was
a
good
sailor
was
pretty
happy
on
deck
and
would
have
been
quite
so
if
the
pigs
would
only
tire
of
their
continual
squealing
with
the
exception
of
a
very
dirty
old
woman
sitting
by
a
crate
of
geese
all
the
passengers
but
himself
were
below
this
old
woman
made
the
journey
monthly
with
geese
for
the
liverpool
market
sherman
was
dreaming
he
began
to
feel
very
desolate
and
commenced
a
letter
to
mary
carton
in
his
notebook
to
state
this
fact
he
was
a
laborious
and
unpractised
writer
and
found
it
helped
him
to
make
a
pencil
copy
sometimes
he
stopped
and
watched
the
puffin
sleeping
on
the
waves
each
one
of
them
had
its
head
tucked
in
in
a
somewhat
different
way
is
because
their
characters
are
different
he
thought
gradually
he
began
to
notice
a
great
many
corks
floating
by
one
after
the
other
the
old
woman
saw
them
too
and
said
waking
out
of
a
half
sleep
john
sherman
we
will
be
in
the
mersey
before
evening
why
are
ye
among
them
savages
in
london
misther
john
why
ye
stay
among
your
own
people
for
what
have
we
in
this
life
but
a
mouthful

second
part
margaret
leland
i
sherman
and
his
mother
rented
a
small
house
on
the
north
side
of
square
hammersmith
the
front
windows
looked
out
on
to
the
old
rank
and
green
square
the
windows
behind
on
to
a
little
patch
of
garden
round
which
the
houses
gathered
and
pressed
as
though
they
already
longed
to
trample
it
out
in
this
garden
was
a
single
tall
pear
tree
that
never
bore
fruit
three
years
passed
by
without
any
notable
event
sherman
went
every
day
to
his
office
in
tower
hill
street
abused
his
work
a
great
deal
and
was
not
unhappy
perhaps
he
was
probably
a
bad
clerk
but
then
nobody
was
very
exacting
with
the
nephew
of
the
head
of
the
firm
the
firm
of
sherman
and
saunders
was
a
house
saunders
had
been
dead
some
years
and
old
michael
sherman
ruled
alone
an
old
bachelor
full
of
family
pride
and
pride
in
his
wealth
he
lived
for
all
that
in
a
very
simple
fashion
his
mahogany
furniture
was
a
little
solider
than
other
perhaps
he
did
not
understand
display
display
finds
its
excuse
in
some
taste
good
or
bad
and
in
a
long
industrious
life
michael
sherman
had
never
found
leisure
to
form
one
he
seemed
to
live
only
from
habit
year
by
year
he
grew
more
silent
gradually
ceasing
to
regard
anything
but
his
family
and
his
ships
his
family
were
represented
by
his
nephew
and
his
mother
he
did
not
feel
much
affection
for
them
he
believed
in
his
family
that
was
all
to
remind
him
of
the
other
goal
of
his
thoughts
hung
round
his
private
office
pictures
with
such
inscriptions
as
at
the
cape
of
good
hope
barque
in
the
mozambique
channel
barque
at
port
said
and
many
more
every
rope
was
drawn
accurately
with
a
ruler
and
here
and
there
were
added
distant
vessels
sailing
proudly
by
with
all
that
indifference
to
perspective
peculiar
to
the
drawings
of
sailors
on
every
ship
was
the
flag
of
the
firm
spread
out
to
show
the
letters
no
man
cared
for
old
michael
sherman
every
one
liked
john
both
were
silent
but
the
young
man
had
sometimes
a
talkative
fit
the
old
man
lived
for
his
ledger
the
young
man
for
his
dreams
in
spite
of
all
these
differences
the
uncle
was
on
the
whole
pleased
with
the
nephew
he
noticed
a
certain
stolidity
that
was
of
the
family
it
sometimes
irritated
others
it
pleased
him
he
saw
a
hundred
indications
besides
that
made
him
say
is
a
true
sherman
we
shermans
begin
that
way
and
give
up
frivolity
as
we
grow
old
we
are
all
the
same
in
the
sherman
and
her
son
had
but
a
small
round
of
acquaintances
a
few
rich
people
clients
of
the
house
of
sherman
and
saunders
for
the
most
part
among
these
was
a
miss
margaret
leland
who
lived
with
her
mother
the
widow
of
the
late
henry
leland
on
the
eastern
side
of
square
their
house
was
larger
than
the
and
noticeable
among
its
fellows
by
the
within
on
every
side
were
bronzes
and
china
vases
and
heavy
curtains
in
all
were
displayed
the
curious
and
vagrant
taste
of
margaret
leland
the
rich
italian
and
mediæval
draperies
of
taste
jostling
the
brightest
and
vulgarest
products
of
more
native
and
saxon
schools
vases
of
the
most
artistic
shape
and
colour
side
by
side
with
artificial
flowers
and
stuffed
birds
this
house
belonged
to
the
lelands
they
had
bought
it
in
less
prosperous
days
and
having
altered
it
according
to
their
taste
and
the
need
of
their
growing
welfare
could
not
decide
to
leave
it
sherman
was
an
occasional
caller
at
the
lelands
and
had
certainly
a
liking
though
not
a
very
deep
one
for
margaret
as
yet
he
knew
little
more
about
her
than
that
she
wore
the
most
fascinating
hats
that
the
late
lord
lytton
was
her
favourite
author
and
that
she
hated
frogs
it
is
clear
that
she
did
not
know
that
a
french
writer
on
magic
says
the
luxurious
and
extravagant
hate
frogs
because
they
are
cold
solitary
and
dreary
had
she
done
so
she
would
have
been
more
cautious
about
revealing
her
tastes
for
the
rest
john
sherman
was
forgetting
the
town
of
ballah
he
corresponded
indeed
with
mary
carton
but
his
laborious
made
his
letters
fewer
and
fewer
sometimes
too
he
heard
from
howard
who
had
a
curacy
at
glasgow
and
was
on
indifferent
terms
with
his
parishioners
they
objected
to
his
way
of
conducting
the
services
his
letters
were
full
of
it
he
would
not
give
in
he
said
whatever
happened
his
conscience
was
involved
ii
one
afternoon
leland
called
on
sherman
she
very
often
called
this
fat
sentimental
woman
moving
in
the
midst
of
a
cloud
of
scent
the
day
was
warm
and
she
carried
her
too
elaborate
and
heavy
dress
as
a
large
drags
its
case
with
much
labour
and
patience
she
sat
down
on
the
sofa
with
obvious
relief
leaning
so
heavily
among
the
cushions
that
a
fluttered
out
of
an
antimacassar
to
be
knocked
down
and
crushed
by
sherman
who
was
very
quick
in
her
movements
as
soon
as
she
found
her
breath
leland
began
a
long
history
of
her
sorrows
her
daughter
margaret
had
been
jilted
and
was
in
despair
had
taken
to
her
bed
with
every
resolution
to
die
and
was
growing
paler
and
paler
the
man
though
she
knew
he
had
heard
did
not
relent
she
knew
he
had
heard
because
her
daughter
had
told
his
sister
all
about
it
and
his
sister
had
no
heart
because
she
said
it
was
temper
that
ailed
margaret
and
she
was
a
little
vixen
and
that
if
she
had
not
flirted
with
everybody
the
engagement
would
never
have
been
broken
off
but
sims
had
no
heart
clearly
as
miss
marriot
and
eliza
taylor
her
friends
said
when
they
heard
and
lock
the
butler
said
the
same
too
and
mary
young
the
housemaid
said
so
too
and
she
knew
all
about
it
for
margaret
used
to
read
his
letters
to
her
often
when
having
her
hair
brushed
must
have
been
very
fond
of
him
said
sherman
is
so
romantic
my
dear
answered
leland
with
a
sigh
am
afraid
she
takes
after
an
uncle
on
her
side
who
wrote
poetry
and
wore
a
velvet
jacket
and
ran
away
with
an
italian
countess
who
used
to
get
drunk
when
i
married
leland
people
said
he
was
not
worthy
of
me
and
that
i
was
throwing
myself
away
and
he
in
business
too
but
margaret
is
so
romantic
there
was
walters
a
and
simpson
who
had
a
shop
i
never
approved
of
him
and
samuelson
and
the
hon
william
scott
she
tired
of
them
all
except
the
hon
william
scott
who
tired
of
her
because
someone
told
him
she
put
belladonna
in
her
eyes
and
it
is
not
true
and
now
there
is
sims
she
then
cried
a
little
and
allowed
herself
to
be
consoled
by
sherman
talk
so
intelligently
and
are
so
well
informed
she
said
at
parting
have
made
a
very
pleasant
call
and
the
toiled
upon
its
way
arriving
in
time
at
other
cups
of
tea
iii
the
day
after
call
upon
his
mother
john
sherman
returning
home
after
his
not
very
lengthy
day
in
the
office
saw
margaret
coming
towards
him
she
had
a
racket
under
her
arm
and
was
walking
slowly
on
the
shady
side
of
the
road
she
was
a
pretty
girl
with
quite
irregular
features
who
though
not
really
more
than
pretty
had
so
much
manner
so
much
of
an
air
that
every
one
called
her
a
beauty
a
trefoil
with
the
fragrance
of
a
rose
sherman
she
cried
coming
smiling
to
meet
him
have
been
ill
but
could
not
stand
the
house
any
longer
i
am
going
to
the
square
to
play
tennis
will
you
come
with
me
am
a
bad
player
he
said
course
you
are
she
answered
you
are
the
only
person
under
a
hundred
to
be
found
this
afternoon
how
dull
life
is
she
continued
with
a
sigh
heard
how
ill
i
have
been
what
do
you
do
all
day
sit
at
a
desk
sometimes
writing
and
sometimes
when
i
get
lazy
looking
up
at
the
flies
there
are
fourteen
on
the
plaster
of
the
ceiling
over
my
head
they
died
two
winters
ago
i
sometimes
think
to
have
them
brushed
off
but
they
have
been
there
so
long
now
i
hardly
like
you
like
them
she
said
you
are
accustomed
to
them
in
most
cases
there
is
not
much
more
to
be
said
for
our
family
affections
i
a
room
close
at
hand
he
went
on
is
you
know
uncle
michael
who
never
you
have
an
uncle
who
never
speaks
i
have
a
mother
who
never
is
silent
she
went
to
see
sherman
the
other
day
what
did
she
say
to
her
what
a
dull
thing
existence
is
this
with
a
great
sigh
the
fates
are
weaving
our
web
of
life
some
mischievous
goblin
always
runs
off
with
the
everything
is
dull
and
grey
am
i
looking
a
little
pale
i
have
been
so
very
little
bit
pale
perhaps
he
said
doubtfully
the
square
gate
brought
them
to
a
stop
it
was
locked
but
she
had
the
key
the
lock
was
stiff
but
turned
easily
for
john
sherman
strong
you
are
she
said
it
was
an
iridescent
evening
of
spring
the
leaves
of
the
bushes
had
still
their
faint
green
as
margaret
darted
about
at
the
tennis
a
red
feather
in
her
cap
seemed
to
rejoice
with
its
wearer
everything
was
at
once
gay
and
tranquil
the
whole
world
had
that
unreal
air
it
assumes
at
beautiful
moments
as
though
it
might
vanish
at
a
touch
like
an
iridescent
after
a
little
margaret
said
she
was
tired
and
sitting
on
a
among
the
bushes
began
telling
him
the
plots
of
novels
lately
read
by
her
suddenly
she
cried
were
all
serious
people
like
you
they
are
so
hard
on
people
like
me
they
always
make
us
come
to
a
bad
end
they
we
are
always
acting
acting
acting
and
what
else
do
you
serious
people
do
you
act
before
the
world
i
think
do
you
know
act
before
ourselves
all
the
old
foolish
kings
and
queens
in
history
were
like
us
they
laughed
and
beckoned
and
went
to
the
block
for
no
very
good
purpose
i
daresay
the
headsmen
were
like
would
never
cut
off
so
pretty
a
yes
you
would
you
would
cut
off
mine
all
this
she
said
vehemently
piercing
him
with
her
bright
eyes
would
cut
off
my
head
she
repeated
almost
fiercely
tell
you
you
her
departure
was
always
unexpected
her
moods
changed
with
so
much
rapidity
she
said
pointing
where
the
clock
on
church
showed
above
the
bushes
minutes
to
five
in
five
minutes
my
it
is
like
growing
old
i
go
to
gossip
the
red
feather
shone
for
a
moment
among
the
bushes
and
was
gone
iv
the
next
day
and
the
day
after
sherman
was
followed
by
those
bright
eyes
when
he
opened
a
letter
at
his
desk
they
seemed
to
gaze
at
him
from
the
open
paper
and
to
watch
him
from
the
flies
upon
the
ceiling
he
was
even
a
worse
clerk
than
usual
one
evening
he
said
to
his
mother
leland
has
beautiful
dear
she
puts
belladonna
in
a
thing
to
say
know
she
does
though
her
mother
denies
she
is
certainly
beautiful
he
answered
dear
if
she
has
an
attraction
for
you
i
want
to
discourage
it
she
is
rich
as
girls
go
nowadays
and
one
woman
has
one
fault
another
another
untidy
one
fights
with
her
servants
one
fights
with
her
friends
another
has
a
crabbed
tongue
when
she
talks
of
sherman
became
again
silent
finding
no
fragment
of
romance
in
such
a
discourse
in
the
next
week
or
two
he
saw
much
of
miss
leland
he
met
her
almost
every
evening
on
his
return
from
the
office
walking
slowly
her
racket
under
her
arm
they
played
tennis
much
and
talked
more
sherman
began
to
play
tennis
in
his
dreams
miss
leland
told
him
all
about
herself
her
friends
her
inmost
feelings
and
yet
every
day
he
knew
less
about
her
it
was
not
merely
that
saying
everything
she
said
nothing
but
that
continually
there
came
through
her
wild
words
the
sound
of
the
mysterious
flutes
and
viols
of
that
unconscious
nature
which
dwells
so
much
nearer
to
woman
than
to
man
how
often
do
we
not
endow
the
beautiful
and
candid
with
depth
and
mystery
not
their
own
we
do
not
know
that
we
but
hear
in
their
voices
those
flutes
and
viols
playing
to
us
of
the
alluring
secret
of
the
world
sherman
had
never
known
in
early
life
what
is
called
first
love
and
now
when
he
had
passed
thirty
it
came
to
him
that
love
more
of
the
imagination
than
of
either
the
senses
or
affections
it
was
mainly
the
eyes
that
followed
him
it
is
not
to
be
denied
that
as
this
love
grew
serious
it
grew
mercenary
now
active
now
latent
the
notion
had
long
been
in
mind
as
we
know
that
he
should
marry
money
a
born
lounger
riches
tempted
him
greatly
when
those
eyes
haunted
him
from
the
fourteen
flies
on
the
ceiling
he
would
say
should
be
rich
i
should
have
a
house
in
the
country
i
should
hunt
and
shoot
and
have
a
garden
and
three
gardeners
i
should
leave
this
abominable
then
the
eyes
became
even
more
beautiful
it
was
a
new
kind
of
belladonna
he
shrank
a
little
however
from
choosing
even
this
pleasant
pathway
he
had
planned
many
futures
for
himself
and
learnt
to
love
them
all
it
was
this
that
had
made
him
linger
on
at
ballah
for
so
long
and
it
was
this
that
now
kept
him
undecided
he
would
have
to
give
up
the
universe
for
a
garden
and
three
gardeners
how
sad
it
was
to
make
substantial
even
the
best
of
his
dreams
how
hard
it
was
to
submit
to
that
decree
which
compels
every
step
we
take
in
life
to
be
a
death
in
the
imagination
how
difficult
it
was
to
be
so
enwrapped
in
this
one
new
hope
as
not
to
hear
the
lamentations
that
were
going
on
in
dim
corners
of
his
mind
one
day
he
resolved
to
propose
he
examined
himself
in
the
glass
in
the
morning
and
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
smiled
to
see
how
he
was
in
the
evening
before
leaving
the
office
he
peered
at
himself
in
the
mirror
over
the
mantlepiece
in
the
room
where
customers
were
received
the
sun
was
blazing
through
the
window
full
on
his
face
he
did
not
look
so
well
immediately
all
courage
left
him
that
evening
he
went
out
after
his
mother
had
gone
to
bed
and
walked
far
along
the
of
the
thames
a
faint
mist
half
covered
away
the
houses
and
factory
chimneys
on
the
further
side
beside
him
a
band
of
osiers
swayed
softly
the
deserted
and
full
river
lapping
their
stems
he
looked
on
all
these
things
with
foreign
eyes
he
had
no
sense
of
possession
indeed
it
seemed
to
him
that
everything
in
london
was
owned
by
too
many
to
be
owned
by
anyone
another
river
that
he
did
seem
to
possess
flowed
through
his
memory
with
all
its
familiar
sights
boys
riding
in
the
stream
to
the
fish
leaping
raising
their
small
ripples
a
swan
asleep
the
wallflowers
growing
on
the
red
brick
of
the
margin
he
grew
very
sad
suddenly
a
shooting
star
fiery
and
vagabond
leaped
from
the
darkness
it
brought
his
mind
again
in
a
moment
to
margaret
leland
to
marry
her
he
thought
was
to
separate
himself
from
the
old
life
he
loved
so
well
crossing
the
river
at
putney
he
hurried
homewards
among
the
nearing
home
the
streets
were
deserted
the
shops
closed
where
king
street
joins
the
broadway
entirely
alone
with
itself
in
the
very
centre
of
the
road
a
little
black
cat
was
leaping
after
its
shadow
he
thought
would
be
a
good
thing
to
be
a
little
black
cat
to
leap
about
in
the
moonlight
and
sleep
in
the
sunlight
and
catch
flies
to
have
no
hard
tasks
to
do
or
hard
decisions
to
come
to
to
be
simple
and
full
of
animal
at
the
corner
of
bridge
road
was
a
the
only
sign
of
human
life
he
bought
some
cold
meat
and
flung
it
to
the
little
black
cat
v
some
more
days
went
by
at
last
one
day
arriving
at
the
square
somewhat
earlier
than
usual
and
sitting
down
to
wait
for
margaret
on
the
seat
among
the
bushes
he
noticed
the
pieces
of
a
letter
lying
about
beside
him
on
the
seat
was
a
pencil
as
though
someone
had
been
writing
there
and
left
it
behind
them
the
was
worn
very
short
the
letter
had
been
torn
up
perhaps
in
a
fit
of
impatience
in
a
way
he
glanced
over
the
scraps
on
one
of
them
he
read
dear
eliza
what
an
incurable
gossip
my
mother
is
you
heard
of
my
misfortune
i
nearly
here
he
had
to
search
among
the
scraps
at
last
he
found
one
that
seemed
to
follow
you
will
hear
news
from
me
soon
there
is
a
handsome
young
man
who
pays
me
attention
here
another
piece
had
to
be
found
would
take
him
though
he
had
a
face
like
the
man
in
the
moon
and
limped
like
the
devil
at
the
theatre
perhaps
i
am
a
little
in
love
oh
friend
of
my
heart
here
it
broke
off
again
he
was
interested
and
searched
the
grass
and
the
bushes
for
fragments
some
had
been
blown
to
quite
a
distance
he
got
together
several
sentences
now
will
not
spend
another
winter
with
my
mother
for
anything
all
this
is
of
course
a
secret
i
had
to
tell
somebody
secrets
are
bad
for
my
health
perhaps
it
will
all
come
to
then
the
letter
went
off
into
dress
the
last
novel
the
writer
had
read
and
so
forth
a
miss
sims
too
was
mentioned
who
had
said
some
unkind
thing
of
the
writer
sherman
was
greatly
amused
it
did
not
seem
to
him
wrong
to
read
we
do
not
mind
spying
on
one
of
the
crowd
any
more
than
on
the
personages
of
literature
it
never
occurred
to
him
that
he
or
any
friend
of
his
was
concerned
in
these
pencil
scribblings
suddenly
he
saw
this
sentence
your
poor
margaret
is
falling
in
love
again
condole
with
her
my
he
started
the
name
the
mention
of
miss
sims
the
style
of
the
whole
letter
all
made
plain
the
authorship
very
desperately
ashamed
of
himself
he
got
up
and
tore
each
scrap
of
paper
into
still
smaller
fragments
and
scattered
them
far
apart
that
evening
he
proposed
and
was
accepted
vi
for
several
days
there
was
a
new
heaven
and
a
new
earth
miss
leland
seemed
suddenly
impressed
with
the
seriousness
of
life
she
was
gentleness
itself
and
as
sherman
sat
on
sunday
mornings
in
his
of
a
garden
under
the
one
tree
with
its
smoky
stem
watching
the
little
circles
of
sunlight
falling
from
the
leaves
like
a
shower
of
new
sovereigns
he
gazed
at
them
with
a
longer
and
keener
joy
than
heretofore
a
new
heaven
and
a
new
earth
surely
sherman
planted
and
dug
and
raked
this
of
a
garden
most
diligently
rooting
out
the
docks
and
dandelions
and
and
the
patches
of
untimely
grass
it
was
the
point
of
contact
between
his
new
life
and
the
old
it
was
far
too
small
and
unfertile
and
to
satisfy
his
love
of
experiments
and
early
vegetables
perforce
this
husbandry
was
too
little
complex
for
his
affections
to
gather
much
round
plant
and
bed
his
garden
in
ballah
used
to
touch
him
like
the
growth
of
a
young
family
now
he
was
content
to
satisfy
his
barbaric
sense
of
colour
right
round
were
planted
alternate
hollyhock
and
sunflower
and
behind
them
showed
their
cloven
shoots
one
sunday
it
occurred
to
him
to
write
to
his
friends
on
the
matter
of
his
engagement
he
numbered
them
over
howard
one
or
two
less
intimate
and
mary
carton
at
that
name
he
paused
he
would
not
write
just
yet
vii
one
saturday
there
was
a
tennis
party
miss
leland
devoted
herself
all
day
to
a
young
foreign
office
clerk
she
played
tennis
with
him
talked
with
him
drank
lemonade
with
him
had
neither
thoughts
nor
words
for
anyone
else
john
sherman
was
quite
happy
tennis
was
always
a
bore
and
now
he
was
not
called
upon
to
play
it
had
not
struck
him
there
was
occasion
for
jealousy
as
the
guests
were
dispersing
his
betrothed
came
to
him
her
manner
seemed
strange
anything
ail
you
margaret
he
asked
as
they
left
the
square
she
answered
looking
about
her
with
ostentatious
secrecy
are
a
most
annoying
person
you
have
no
feeling
you
have
no
temperament
you
are
quite
the
most
stupid
creature
i
was
ever
engaged
is
wrong
with
you
he
asked
in
bewilderment
you
see
she
replied
with
a
broken
voice
flirted
all
day
with
that
young
clerk
you
should
have
nearly
killed
me
with
jealousy
you
do
not
love
me
a
bit
there
is
no
knowing
what
i
might
do
you
know
he
said
was
not
right
of
you
people
might
say
at
john
sherman
how
furious
he
must
be
to
be
sure
i
be
furious
a
bit
but
then
go
about
saying
i
was
it
would
not
matter
of
course
but
you
know
it
is
not
right
of
is
no
use
pretending
you
have
feeling
it
is
all
that
miserable
little
town
you
come
from
with
its
sleepy
old
shops
and
its
sleepy
old
society
i
would
give
up
loving
you
this
minute
she
added
with
a
caressing
look
you
had
not
that
beautiful
bronzed
face
i
will
improve
you
evening
you
must
come
to
the
suddenly
she
changed
the
subject
you
see
that
little
fat
man
coming
out
of
the
square
and
staring
at
me
i
was
engaged
to
him
once
look
at
the
four
old
ladies
behind
him
shaking
their
bonnets
at
me
each
has
some
story
about
me
and
it
will
be
all
the
same
in
a
hundred
after
this
he
had
hardly
a
peace
she
kept
him
continually
going
to
theatres
operas
parties
these
last
were
an
especial
trouble
for
it
was
her
wont
to
gather
about
her
an
admiring
circle
to
listen
to
her
extravagancies
and
he
was
no
longer
at
the
age
when
we
enjoy
audacity
for
its
own
sake
viii
gradually
those
bright
eyes
of
his
imagination
watching
him
from
letters
and
from
among
the
fourteen
flies
on
the
ceiling
had
ceased
to
be
centres
of
peace
they
seemed
like
two
whirlpools
wherein
the
order
and
quiet
of
his
life
were
absorbed
hourly
and
daily
he
still
thought
sometimes
of
the
country
house
of
his
dreams
and
of
the
garden
and
the
three
gardeners
but
somehow
they
had
lost
half
their
charm
he
had
written
to
howard
and
some
others
and
commenced
at
last
a
letter
to
mary
carton
it
lay
unfinished
on
his
desk
a
thin
coating
of
dust
was
gathering
upon
it
leland
called
continually
on
sherman
she
sentimentalized
over
the
lovers
and
even
wept
over
them
each
visit
supplied
the
household
with
conversation
for
a
week
every
sunday
morning
his
time
sherman
looked
at
his
uncompleted
letter
gradually
it
became
plain
to
him
he
could
not
finish
it
it
had
never
seemed
to
him
he
had
more
than
friendship
for
mary
carton
yet
somehow
it
was
not
possible
to
tell
her
of
this
the
more
his
betrothed
troubled
him
the
more
he
thought
about
the
unfinished
letter
he
was
a
man
standing
at
the
cross
roads
whenever
the
wind
blew
from
the
south
he
remembered
his
friend
for
that
is
the
wind
that
fills
the
heart
with
memory
one
sunday
he
removed
the
dust
from
the
face
of
the
letter
almost
reverently
as
though
it
were
the
dust
from
the
wheels
of
destiny
but
the
letter
remained
unfinished
ix
one
wednesday
in
june
sherman
arrived
home
an
hour
earlier
than
usual
from
his
office
as
his
wont
was
the
first
wednesday
in
every
month
on
which
day
his
mother
was
at
home
to
her
friends
they
had
not
many
callers
there
was
no
one
as
yet
but
a
old
lady
his
mother
had
picked
up
he
knew
not
where
she
had
been
looking
at
his
photograph
album
and
recalling
names
and
dates
from
her
own
prosperous
times
as
she
went
out
miss
leland
came
in
she
gave
the
old
lady
in
passing
a
critical
look
that
made
the
poor
creature
very
conscious
of
a
threadbare
mantle
and
went
over
to
sherman
holding
out
both
hands
sherman
who
knew
all
his
peculiarities
noticed
on
her
side
a
slight
coldness
perhaps
she
did
not
altogether
like
this
beautiful
have
come
said
miss
leland
tell
john
that
he
must
learn
to
paint
music
and
society
are
not
enough
there
is
nothing
like
art
to
give
then
turning
to
john
sherman
dear
i
will
make
you
quite
different
you
are
a
dreadful
barbarian
you
ails
me
margaret
look
at
that
necktie
nothing
shows
a
cultivation
like
his
necktie
then
your
reading
you
never
read
anything
but
old
books
nobody
wants
to
talk
about
i
will
lend
you
three
everyone
has
read
this
month
you
really
must
acquire
small
talk
and
change
your
presently
she
noticed
the
lying
open
on
a
chair
she
cried
must
have
another
look
at
it
was
a
habit
of
his
to
gather
all
manner
of
pretty
faces
it
came
from
incipient
old
bachelorhood
perhaps
margaret
criticised
each
photograph
in
turn
with
she
looks
as
if
she
had
some
life
in
her
or
do
not
like
your
sleepy
eyelids
or
some
such
phrase
the
mere
relations
were
passed
by
without
a
word
one
face
occurred
several
times
a
quiet
face
as
margaret
came
on
this
one
for
the
third
time
sherman
who
seemed
a
little
resentful
about
something
said
is
his
friend
mary
told
me
about
her
he
has
a
book
she
gave
him
so
that
is
she
how
interesting
i
pity
these
poor
country
people
it
must
be
hard
to
keep
from
getting
friend
is
not
at
all
stupid
said
sherman
she
speak
with
a
brogue
i
remember
you
told
me
she
was
very
good
it
must
be
difficult
to
keep
from
talking
platitudes
when
one
is
very
are
quite
wrong
about
her
you
would
like
her
very
much
he
replied
is
one
of
those
people
i
suppose
who
can
only
talk
about
their
relatives
or
their
families
or
about
their
children
how
this
one
has
got
the
and
this
one
is
getting
well
of
the
measles
she
kept
swaying
one
of
the
leaves
between
her
finger
and
thumb
impatiently
a
strange
way
she
does
her
hair
and
what
an
ugly
dress
must
not
talk
that
way
about
her
she
is
my
great
friend
she
burst
out
thinks
i
will
believe
in
friendship
between
a
man
and
a
woman
she
got
up
and
said
turning
round
with
an
air
of
changing
the
subject
you
written
to
your
friends
about
our
engagement
you
had
not
done
so
when
i
asked
you
not
great
friend
miss
what
do
you
call
her
carton
i
have
not
written
to
she
tapped
impatiently
with
her
foot
were
really
old
companions
that
is
all
said
sherman
wishing
to
mend
matters
were
both
readers
that
brought
them
together
i
never
much
fancied
her
yet
she
was
well
enough
as
a
friend
and
helped
maybe
with
reading
and
the
gardening
and
his
good
to
keep
him
from
the
idle
young
men
of
the
must
make
him
write
and
tell
her
at
once
you
must
you
must
almost
sobbed
out
miss
leland
promise
he
answered
immediately
returning
to
herself
she
cried
i
were
in
her
place
i
know
what
i
would
like
to
do
when
i
got
the
letter
i
know
who
i
would
like
to
kill
this
with
a
laugh
as
she
went
over
and
looked
at
herself
in
the
mirror
on
the
mantlepiece
third
part
john
sherman
revisits
ballah
i
the
others
had
gone
and
sherman
was
alone
in
the
by
himself
looking
through
the
window
never
had
london
seemed
to
him
so
like
a
reef
whereon
he
was
cast
away
in
the
square
the
bushes
were
covered
with
dust
some
sparrows
were
ruffling
their
feathers
on
the
people
passed
continually
disturbing
them
the
sky
was
full
of
smoke
a
terrible
feeling
of
solitude
in
the
midst
of
a
multitude
oppressed
him
a
portion
of
his
life
was
ending
he
thought
that
soon
he
would
be
no
longer
a
young
man
and
now
at
the
period
when
the
desire
of
novelty
grows
less
was
coming
the
great
change
of
his
life
he
felt
he
was
of
those
whose
granaries
are
in
the
past
and
now
this
past
would
never
renew
itself
he
was
going
out
into
the
distance
as
though
with
strange
sailors
in
a
strange
ship
he
longed
to
see
again
the
town
where
he
had
spent
his
childhood
to
see
the
narrow
roads
and
mean
little
shops
and
perhaps
it
would
be
easier
to
tell
her
who
had
been
the
friend
of
so
many
years
of
this
engagement
in
his
own
person
than
by
letter
he
wondered
why
it
was
so
hard
to
write
so
simple
a
thing
it
was
his
custom
to
act
suddenly
on
his
decisions
he
had
not
made
many
in
his
life
the
next
day
he
announced
at
the
office
that
he
would
be
absent
for
three
or
four
days
he
told
his
mother
he
had
business
in
the
country
his
betrothed
met
him
on
the
way
to
the
terminus
as
he
was
walking
bag
in
hand
and
asked
where
he
was
going
am
going
on
business
to
the
country
he
said
and
blushed
he
was
creeping
away
like
a
thief
ii
he
arrived
in
the
town
of
ballah
by
rail
for
he
had
avoided
the
slow
and
gone
by
dublin
it
was
the
forenoon
and
he
made
for
the
imperial
hotel
to
wait
till
four
in
the
evening
when
he
would
find
mary
carton
in
the
schoolhouse
for
he
had
timed
his
journey
so
as
to
arrive
on
thursday
the
day
of
the
practice
as
he
went
through
the
streets
his
heart
went
out
to
every
familiar
place
and
sight
the
rows
of
thatched
cottages
the
slated
roofs
of
the
shops
the
women
selling
gooseberries
the
river
bridge
the
high
walls
of
the
garden
where
it
was
said
the
gardener
used
to
see
the
ghost
of
a
former
owner
in
the
shape
of
a
rabbit
the
street
corner
no
child
would
pass
at
nightfall
for
fear
of
the
headless
soldier
the
deserted
the
wharves
covered
with
grass
all
these
he
watched
with
celtic
devotion
that
devotion
carried
to
the
ends
of
the
world
by
the
celtic
exiles
and
since
old
time
surrounding
their
journeyings
with
rumour
of
plaintive
songs
he
sat
in
the
window
of
the
imperial
hotel
now
full
of
guests
he
did
not
notice
any
of
them
he
sat
there
meditating
meditating
grey
clouds
covering
the
town
with
flying
shadows
rushed
by
like
the
old
and
dishevelled
eagles
that
maeldune
saw
hurrying
towards
the
waters
of
life
below
in
the
street
passed
by
country
people
townspeople
travellers
women
with
baskets
boys
driving
donkeys
old
men
with
sticks
sometimes
he
recognized
a
face
or
was
recognized
himself
and
welcomed
by
some
familiar
voice
have
come
home
a
handsomer
gentleman
than
your
father
misther
john
and
he
was
a
neat
figure
of
a
man
god
bless
him
said
the
waiter
bringing
him
his
lunch
and
in
truth
sherman
had
grown
handsomer
for
these
years
away
his
face
and
gesture
had
more
of
dignity
for
on
the
centre
of
his
nature
life
had
dropped
a
pinch
of
experience
at
four
he
left
the
hotel
and
waited
near
the
schoolhouse
till
the
children
came
running
out
one
or
two
of
the
elder
ones
he
recognized
but
turned
away
iii
mary
carton
was
locking
the
harmonium
as
he
went
in
she
came
to
meet
him
with
a
surprised
and
joyful
air
often
i
have
wished
to
see
you
when
did
you
come
how
well
you
remembered
my
habits
to
know
where
to
find
me
my
dear
john
how
glad
i
am
to
see
you
are
the
same
as
when
i
left
and
this
room
is
the
same
she
answered
same
only
i
have
had
some
new
prints
hung
up
prints
of
fruits
and
leaves
and
it
was
only
done
last
week
when
people
choose
pictures
and
poems
for
children
they
choose
out
such
domestic
ones
i
would
not
have
any
of
the
kind
children
are
such
undomestic
animals
but
john
i
am
so
glad
to
see
you
in
this
old
schoolhouse
again
so
little
has
changed
with
us
here
some
have
died
and
some
have
been
married
and
we
are
all
a
little
older
and
the
trees
a
little
have
come
to
tell
you
i
am
going
to
be
she
became
in
a
moment
perfectly
white
and
sat
down
as
though
attacked
with
faintness
her
hand
on
the
edge
of
the
chair
trembled
sherman
looked
at
her
and
went
on
in
a
bewildered
mechanical
way
betrothed
is
a
miss
leland
she
has
a
good
deal
of
money
you
know
my
mother
always
wished
me
to
marry
some
one
with
money
her
father
when
alive
was
an
old
client
of
sherman
and
saunders
she
is
much
admired
in
gradually
his
voice
became
a
mere
murmur
he
did
not
seem
to
know
that
he
was
speaking
he
stopped
entirely
he
was
looking
at
mary
carton
everything
around
him
was
as
it
had
been
some
three
years
before
the
table
was
covered
with
cups
and
the
floor
with
crumbs
perhaps
the
mouse
pulling
at
a
crumb
under
the
table
was
the
same
mouse
as
on
that
other
evening
the
only
difference
was
the
brooding
daylight
of
summer
and
the
ceaseless
chirruping
of
the
sparrows
in
the
ivy
outside
he
had
a
confused
sense
of
having
lost
his
way
it
was
just
the
same
feeling
he
had
known
as
a
child
when
one
dark
night
he
had
taken
a
wrong
turning
and
instead
of
arriving
at
his
own
house
found
himself
at
a
landmark
he
knew
was
miles
from
home
a
moment
earlier
however
difficult
his
life
the
issues
were
always
definite
now
suddenly
had
entered
the
obscurity
of
interest
before
this
it
had
not
occurred
to
him
that
mary
carton
had
any
stronger
feeling
for
him
than
warm
friendship
he
began
again
speaking
in
the
same
mechanical
way
leland
lives
with
her
mother
near
us
she
is
very
well
educated
and
very
well
connected
though
she
has
lived
always
among
business
miss
carton
with
a
great
effort
had
recovered
her
composure
congratulate
you
she
said
hope
you
will
be
always
happy
you
came
here
on
some
business
for
your
firm
i
suppose
i
believe
they
have
some
connection
with
the
town
only
came
here
to
tell
you
i
was
going
to
be
you
not
think
it
would
have
been
better
to
have
written
she
said
beginning
to
put
away
the
in
a
cupboard
by
the
fireplace
would
have
been
better
he
answered
drooping
his
head
without
a
word
locking
the
door
behind
them
they
went
out
without
a
word
they
walked
the
grey
streets
now
and
then
a
woman
or
a
child
curtseyed
as
they
passed
some
wondered
perhaps
to
see
these
old
friends
so
silent
at
the
rectory
they
bade
each
other
hope
you
will
be
always
happy
she
said
will
pray
for
you
and
your
wife
i
am
very
busy
with
the
children
and
old
people
but
i
shall
always
find
a
moment
to
wish
you
well
in
they
parted
the
gate
in
the
wall
closed
behind
her
he
stayed
for
a
few
moments
looking
up
at
the
tops
of
the
trees
and
bushes
showing
over
the
wall
and
at
the
house
a
little
way
beyond
he
stood
considering
his
problem
her
life
his
life
his
at
any
rate
would
have
incident
and
change
hers
would
be
the
narrow
existence
of
a
woman
who
failing
to
fulfil
the
only
abiding
wish
she
has
ever
formed
seeks
to
lose
herself
in
routine
mournfulest
of
things
on
this
old
planet
this
had
been
revealed
he
loved
mary
carton
she
loved
him
he
remembered
margaret
leland
and
murmured
she
did
well
to
be
jealous
then
all
her
contemptuous
words
about
the
town
and
its
inhabitants
came
into
his
mind
once
they
made
no
impression
on
him
but
now
the
sense
of
personal
identity
having
been
disturbed
by
this
sudden
revelation
alien
as
they
were
to
his
way
of
thinking
they
began
to
press
in
on
him
mary
too
would
have
agreed
with
them
he
thought
and
might
it
be
that
at
some
distant
time
weary
monotony
in
abandonment
would
have
so
weighed
down
the
spirit
of
mary
carton
that
she
would
be
merely
one
of
the
old
and
sleepy
whose
dulness
filled
the
place
like
a
cloud
he
went
sadly
towards
the
hotel
everything
about
him
the
road
the
sky
the
feet
wherewith
he
walked
seeming
phantasmal
and
without
meaning
he
told
the
waiter
he
would
leave
by
the
first
train
in
the
morning
and
you
only
just
come
home
the
man
answered
he
ordered
coffee
and
could
not
drink
it
he
went
out
and
came
in
again
immediately
he
went
down
into
the
kitchen
and
talked
to
the
servants
they
told
him
of
everything
that
had
happened
since
he
had
gone
he
was
not
interested
and
went
up
to
his
room
must
go
home
and
do
what
people
expect
of
me
one
must
be
careful
to
do
through
all
the
journey
home
his
problem
troubled
him
he
saw
the
figure
of
mary
carton
perpetually
passing
through
a
round
of
monotonous
duties
he
saw
his
own
life
among
aliens
going
on
endlessly
wearily
from
holyhead
to
london
his
were
a
lady
and
her
three
young
daughters
the
eldest
about
twelve
the
smooth
faces
shining
with
became
to
him
ominous
symbols
he
hated
them
they
were
symbolic
of
the
indifferent
world
about
to
absorb
him
and
of
the
vague
something
that
was
dragging
him
inch
by
inch
from
the
nook
he
had
made
for
himself
in
the
he
was
at
one
of
those
dangerous
moments
when
the
sense
of
personal
identity
is
shaken
when
past
and
present
seem
about
to
dissolve
partnership
he
sought
refuge
in
memory
and
counted
over
every
word
of
he
could
remember
he
forgot
the
present
and
the
future
love
he
said
to
himself
would
be
either
gods
or
the
rain
beat
on
the
window
of
the
carriage
he
began
to
listen
thought
and
memory
became
a
blank
his
mind
was
full
of
the
sound
of
fourth
part
the
rev
william
howard
i
after
his
return
to
london
sherman
for
a
time
kept
to
himself
going
straight
home
from
his
office
moody
and
trying
not
to
consider
his
problem
her
life
his
life
he
often
repeated
to
himself
must
do
what
people
expect
of
me
it
does
not
rest
with
me
now
my
choosing
time
is
he
felt
that
whatever
way
he
turned
he
would
do
a
great
evil
to
himself
and
others
to
his
nature
all
sudden
decisions
were
difficult
and
so
he
kept
to
the
groove
he
had
entered
upon
it
did
not
even
occur
to
him
to
do
otherwise
he
never
thought
of
breaking
this
engagement
off
and
letting
people
say
what
they
would
he
was
bound
in
hopelessly
by
a
chain
of
congratulations
a
week
passed
slowly
as
a
month
the
wheels
of
the
cabs
and
carriages
seemed
to
be
rolling
through
his
mind
he
often
remembered
the
quiet
river
at
the
end
of
his
garden
in
the
town
of
ballah
how
the
weeds
swayed
there
and
the
salmon
leaped
at
the
end
came
a
note
from
miss
leland
complaining
of
his
neglecting
her
so
many
days
he
sent
a
rather
formal
answer
promising
to
call
soon
to
add
to
his
other
troubles
a
cold
east
wind
arose
and
made
him
shiver
continually
one
evening
he
and
his
mother
were
sitting
silent
the
one
knitting
the
other
he
had
been
writing
letters
and
was
now
in
a
reverie
round
the
walls
were
one
or
two
drawings
done
by
him
at
school
his
mother
had
got
them
framed
his
eyes
were
fixed
on
a
drawing
of
a
stream
and
some
astonishing
cows
a
few
days
ago
he
had
found
an
old
sketchbook
for
children
among
some
forgotten
papers
which
taught
how
to
draw
a
horse
by
making
three
ovals
for
the
basis
of
his
body
one
lying
down
in
the
middle
two
standing
up
at
each
end
for
flank
and
chest
and
how
to
draw
a
cow
by
basing
its
body
on
a
square
he
kept
trying
to
fit
squares
into
the
cows
he
was
half
inclined
to
take
them
out
of
their
frames
and
retouch
on
this
new
principle
then
he
began
somehow
to
remember
the
child
with
the
swollen
face
who
threw
a
stone
at
the
dog
the
day
he
resolved
to
leave
home
first
then
some
other
image
came
his
problem
moved
before
him
in
a
disjointed
way
he
was
dropping
asleep
through
his
reverie
came
the
click
click
of
his
needles
she
had
found
some
london
children
to
knit
for
he
was
at
that
marchland
between
waking
and
dreaming
where
our
thoughts
begin
to
have
a
life
of
their
own
the
region
where
art
is
nurtured
and
inspiration
born
he
started
hearing
something
sliding
and
rustling
and
looked
up
to
see
a
piece
of
cardboard
fall
from
one
end
of
the
mantelpiece
and
driven
by
a
slight
gust
of
air
circle
into
the
ashes
under
the
grate
said
his
mother
is
the
portrait
of
the
she
still
spoke
of
the
rev
william
howard
by
the
name
she
had
first
known
him
by
is
always
being
photographed
they
are
all
over
the
house
and
i
an
old
woman
have
not
had
one
taken
all
my
life
take
it
out
with
the
her
son
after
some
poking
in
the
ashes
for
it
had
fallen
far
back
brought
out
a
somewhat
dusty
photograph
she
continued
one
he
sent
us
two
or
three
months
ago
it
has
been
lying
in
the
is
not
so
as
usual
said
sherman
rubbing
the
ashes
off
the
photograph
with
his
sleeve
the
by
his
mother
replied
has
lost
his
parish
i
hear
he
is
very
mediæval
you
know
and
he
lately
preached
a
sermon
to
prove
that
children
who
die
unbaptized
are
lost
he
had
been
reading
up
the
subject
and
was
full
of
it
the
mothers
turned
against
him
not
being
so
familiar
with
augustine
as
he
was
there
were
other
reasons
in
plenty
too
i
wonder
that
anyone
can
stand
that
monkeyish
fantastic
as
the
way
is
with
so
many
people
the
world
for
her
was
divided
up
into
families
rather
than
individuals
while
she
was
talking
sherman
who
had
returned
to
his
chair
leant
over
the
table
and
began
to
write
hurriedly
she
was
continuing
her
denunciation
when
he
interrupted
with
i
have
just
written
this
letter
to
him
dear
howard
you
come
and
spend
the
autumn
with
us
i
hear
you
are
unoccupied
just
now
i
am
engaged
to
be
married
as
you
know
it
will
be
a
long
engagement
you
will
like
my
betrothed
i
hope
you
will
be
great
friends
expectantly
rather
take
me
aback
she
said
really
like
him
he
answered
were
always
prejudiced
against
the
howards
forgive
me
but
i
really
want
very
much
to
have
him
if
you
like
him
i
suppose
i
have
no
do
like
him
he
is
very
clever
said
her
son
knows
a
great
deal
i
wonder
he
does
not
marry
do
you
not
think
he
would
make
a
good
husband
for
you
must
admit
he
is
is
not
difficult
to
sympathize
with
everyone
if
you
have
no
true
principles
and
principles
and
convictions
were
her
names
for
that
strenuous
consistency
attained
without
trouble
by
men
and
women
of
few
ideas
am
sure
you
will
like
him
better
said
the
other
you
see
more
of
that
photograph
quite
spoilt
she
answered
there
was
nothing
on
it
but
is
a
pity
for
one
less
would
be
after
this
they
both
became
silent
she
knitting
he
gazing
at
the
cows
browsing
at
the
edge
of
their
stream
and
trying
to
fit
squares
into
their
bodies
but
now
a
smile
played
about
his
lips
sherman
looked
a
little
troubled
she
would
not
object
to
any
visitor
of
her
but
quite
made
up
her
mind
in
no
manner
to
put
herself
out
to
entertain
the
rev
william
howard
she
was
puzzled
as
well
she
did
not
understand
the
suddenness
of
this
invitation
they
usually
talked
over
things
for
weeks
ii
next
day
his
noticed
a
decided
improvement
in
spirits
he
had
a
cheerfulness
and
alacrity
breaking
out
at
odd
moments
when
evening
came
he
called
for
the
first
time
since
his
return
on
miss
leland
she
scolded
him
for
having
answered
her
note
in
such
a
formal
way
but
was
sincerely
glad
to
see
him
return
to
his
allegiance
we
have
said
he
had
sometimes
though
rarely
a
talkative
fit
he
had
one
this
evening
the
last
play
they
had
been
to
the
last
party
the
picture
of
the
year
all
in
turn
he
glanced
at
she
was
delighted
her
training
had
not
been
in
vain
her
barbarian
was
learning
to
chatter
this
flattered
her
a
deal
was
never
engaged
she
thought
a
more
interesting
when
he
had
risen
to
go
sherman
said
have
a
friend
coming
to
visit
me
in
a
few
days
you
will
suit
each
other
delightfully
he
is
very
tell
me
about
him
i
like
everything
he
cried
with
a
laugh
mediævalism
is
not
in
your
line
he
is
neither
a
gay
troubadour
nor
a
wicked
knight
he
is
a
high
church
not
tell
me
anything
more
about
him
she
answered
will
try
to
be
civil
to
him
but
you
know
i
never
liked
curates
i
have
been
an
agnostic
for
many
years
you
i
believe
are
as
sherman
was
on
his
way
home
he
met
a
and
stopped
him
with
you
an
agnostic
why
what
is
that
nothing
he
made
answer
and
hurried
on
his
way
iii
the
letter
reached
the
rev
william
howard
at
the
right
moment
arriving
as
it
did
in
the
midst
of
a
crisis
in
his
fortunes
in
the
course
of
a
short
life
he
had
lost
many
parishes
he
considered
himself
a
martyr
but
was
considered
by
his
enemies
a
clerical
coxcomb
he
had
a
habit
of
getting
his
mind
possessed
with
some
strange
opinion
or
what
seemed
so
to
his
parishioners
and
of
preaching
it
while
the
notion
lasted
in
the
most
startling
way
the
sermon
on
unbaptized
children
was
an
instance
it
was
not
so
much
that
he
thought
it
true
as
that
it
possessed
him
for
a
day
it
was
not
so
much
the
thought
as
his
own
relation
to
it
that
allured
him
then
too
he
loved
what
appeared
to
his
parishioners
to
be
the
most
unusual
and
dangerous
practices
he
put
candles
on
the
altar
and
crosses
in
unexpected
places
he
delighted
in
the
intricacies
of
high
church
costume
and
was
known
to
recommend
confession
and
prayers
for
the
dead
gradually
the
anger
of
his
parishioners
would
increase
the
rector
the
washerwoman
the
labourers
the
squire
the
doctor
the
the
shoemakers
the
butchers
the
seamstresses
the
local
journalist
the
master
of
the
hounds
the
innkeeper
the
veterinary
surgeon
the
magistrate
the
children
making
mud
pies
all
would
be
filled
with
one
dread
popery
then
he
would
fly
for
consolation
to
his
little
circle
of
the
faithful
the
younger
ladies
who
still
repeated
his
fine
sentiments
and
saw
him
in
their
imaginations
standing
perpetually
before
a
wall
covered
with
tapestry
and
holding
a
crucifix
in
some
constrained
and
ancient
attitude
at
last
he
would
have
to
go
feeling
for
his
parishioners
a
gay
and
lofty
disdain
and
for
himself
that
reverent
approbation
one
gives
to
the
captains
who
lead
the
crusade
of
ideas
against
those
who
merely
sleep
and
eat
an
efficient
crusader
he
certainly
was
too
efficient
indeed
for
his
efficiency
gave
to
all
his
thoughts
a
certain
and
isolation
and
a
kind
of
hardness
to
his
mind
his
intellect
was
like
a
instrument
with
no
he
could
think
carefully
and
cleverly
and
even
with
originality
but
never
in
such
a
way
as
to
make
his
thoughts
an
illusion
to
something
deeper
than
themselves
in
this
he
was
the
reverse
of
poetical
for
poetry
is
essentially
a
touch
from
behind
a
curtain
this
conformation
of
his
mind
helped
to
lead
him
into
all
manner
of
needless
contests
and
to
the
loss
of
this
last
parish
among
much
else
did
not
the
world
exist
for
the
sake
of
these
hard
crystalline
thoughts
with
which
he
played
as
with
so
many
bone
spilikins
delighting
in
his
own
skill
and
were
not
all
who
disliked
them
merely
the
many
in
this
way
it
came
about
that
letter
reached
howard
at
the
right
moment
now
next
to
a
new
parish
he
loved
a
new
friend
a
visit
to
london
meant
many
he
had
found
he
was
on
the
whole
a
success
at
the
beginning
of
friendships
he
at
once
wrote
an
acceptance
in
his
small
and
beautiful
handwriting
and
arrived
shortly
after
his
letter
sherman
on
receiving
him
glanced
at
his
neat
and
shining
boots
the
little
medal
at
the
and
the
hat
and
nodded
as
though
in
answer
to
an
inner
query
he
smiled
approval
at
the
slight
elegant
figure
in
its
black
clothes
at
the
satiny
hair
and
at
the
face
mobile
as
moving
waters
for
several
days
the
shermans
saw
little
of
their
guest
he
had
friends
everywhere
to
turn
into
enemies
and
acquaintances
to
turn
into
friends
his
days
passed
in
visiting
visiting
visiting
then
there
were
theatres
and
churches
to
see
and
new
clothes
to
be
bought
over
which
he
was
as
anxious
as
a
woman
finally
he
settled
down
he
passed
his
mornings
in
the
he
asked
leave
to
hang
on
the
walls
one
or
two
religious
pictures
without
which
he
was
not
happy
and
to
place
over
the
mantelpiece
under
the
an
ebony
crucifix
in
one
corner
of
the
room
he
laid
a
rug
neatly
folded
for
covering
his
knees
on
chilly
days
and
on
the
table
a
small
collection
of
favourite
books
a
curious
and
collection
in
which
cardinal
newman
and
bourget
chrysostom
and
flaubert
lived
together
in
perfect
friendship
early
in
his
visit
sherman
brought
him
to
the
lelands
he
was
a
success
the
three
margaret
sherman
and
howard
played
tennis
in
the
square
howard
was
a
good
player
and
seemed
to
admire
margaret
on
the
way
home
sherman
once
or
twice
laughed
to
himself
it
was
like
the
clucking
of
a
hen
with
a
brood
of
chickens
he
told
howard
too
how
wealthy
margaret
was
said
to
be
after
this
howard
always
joined
sherman
and
margaret
at
the
tennis
sometimes
too
after
a
little
on
days
when
the
study
seemed
dull
and
lonely
and
the
unfinished
essay
on
chrysostom
more
than
usually
laborious
he
would
saunter
towards
the
square
before
his
arrival
to
find
margaret
now
alone
now
with
an
acquaintance
or
two
about
this
time
also
press
of
work
an
unusual
thing
with
him
began
to
delay
sherman
in
town
after
his
usual
time
in
the
evenings
they
often
talked
of
margaret
sherman
frankly
and
carefully
as
though
in
all
anxiety
to
describe
her
as
she
was
and
howard
with
some
enthusiasm
has
a
religious
vocation
he
said
once
with
a
slight
sigh
sometimes
they
played
chess
a
game
that
sherman
had
recently
become
devoted
to
for
he
found
it
drew
him
out
of
himself
more
than
anything
else
howard
now
began
to
notice
a
curious
thing
sherman
grew
shabbier
and
shabbier
and
at
the
same
time
more
and
more
cheerful
this
puzzled
him
for
he
had
noticed
that
he
himself
was
not
cheerful
when
shabby
and
did
not
even
feel
upright
and
clever
when
his
hat
was
getting
old
he
also
noticed
that
when
sherman
was
talking
to
him
he
seemed
to
be
keeping
some
thought
to
himself
when
he
first
came
to
know
him
long
ago
in
ballah
he
had
noticed
occasionally
the
same
thing
and
set
it
down
to
a
kind
of
suspiciousness
and
natural
to
one
who
lived
in
such
an
place
it
seemed
more
persistent
now
however
is
not
he
thought
is
half
a
peasant
he
has
not
the
brilliant
candour
of
the
man
of
the
all
this
while
the
mind
of
sherman
was
clucking
continually
over
its
brood
of
thoughts
ballah
was
being
constantly
suggested
to
him
the
grey
corner
of
a
cloud
slanting
its
rain
upon
cheapside
called
to
mind
by
some
remote
suggestion
the
clouds
rushing
and
falling
in
cloven
surf
on
the
seaward
steep
of
a
mountain
north
of
ballah
a
certain
made
him
remember
an
angle
of
the
ballah
at
night
a
lantern
marking
where
the
road
was
fenced
off
for
mending
made
him
think
of
a
cart
with
its
of
burning
coals
that
used
to
stop
on
market
days
at
the
corner
of
lane
at
ballah
delayed
by
a
crush
in
the
strand
he
heard
a
faint
trickling
of
water
near
by
it
came
from
a
shop
window
where
a
little
balanced
a
wooden
ball
upon
its
point
the
sound
suggested
a
cataract
with
a
long
gaelic
name
that
leaped
crying
into
the
gate
of
the
winds
at
ballah
wandering
among
these
memories
a
footstep
went
to
and
fro
continually
and
the
figure
of
mary
carton
moved
among
them
like
a
phantom
he
was
set
dreaming
a
whole
day
by
walking
down
one
sunday
morning
to
the
border
of
the
thames
a
few
hundred
yards
from
his
house
and
looking
at
the
chiswick
eyot
it
made
him
remember
an
old
of
his
the
source
of
the
river
that
passed
his
garden
at
home
was
a
certain
and
islanded
lake
whither
in
childhood
he
had
often
gone
at
the
further
end
was
a
little
islet
called
innisfree
its
rocky
centre
covered
with
many
bushes
rose
some
forty
feet
above
the
lake
often
when
life
and
its
difficulties
had
seemed
to
him
like
the
lessons
of
some
elder
boy
given
to
a
younger
by
mistake
it
had
seemed
good
to
dream
of
going
away
to
that
islet
and
building
a
wooden
hut
there
and
burning
a
few
years
out
rowing
to
and
fro
fishing
or
lying
on
the
island
slopes
by
day
and
listening
at
night
to
the
ripple
of
the
water
and
the
quivering
of
the
bushes
full
always
of
unknown
creatures
and
going
out
at
morning
to
see
the
edge
marked
by
the
feet
of
birds
these
pictures
became
so
vivid
to
him
that
the
world
about
him
that
howard
margaret
his
mother
even
began
to
seem
far
off
he
hardly
seemed
aware
of
anything
they
were
thinking
and
feeling
the
light
that
dazzled
him
flowed
from
the
vague
and
refracting
regions
of
hope
and
memory
the
light
that
made
feet
unsteady
was
ever
the
lustre
of
life
itself
iv
on
the
evening
of
the
of
june
after
the
blinds
had
been
pulled
down
and
the
gas
lighted
sherman
was
playing
chess
in
the
right
hand
against
left
howard
had
gone
out
with
a
message
to
the
lelands
he
would
often
say
there
any
message
i
can
deliver
for
you
i
know
how
lazy
you
are
and
will
save
you
the
a
message
was
always
found
for
him
a
pile
of
books
lent
for
improvement
went
home
one
by
one
here
said
voice
in
the
doorway
have
been
watching
you
for
some
time
you
are
cheating
the
red
men
most
villainously
you
are
forcing
them
to
make
mistakes
that
the
white
men
may
win
why
a
few
such
games
would
ruin
any
moral
he
was
leaning
against
the
doorway
looking
to
not
too
critical
eyes
an
embodiment
of
all
that
was
and
brilliant
the
great
care
with
which
he
was
dressed
and
his
whole
manner
seemed
to
say
at
me
do
i
not
combine
perfectly
the
zealot
with
the
man
of
the
world
he
seemed
excited
he
had
been
talking
at
the
lelands
and
talking
well
and
felt
that
elation
which
brings
us
many
thoughts
dear
sherman
he
went
on
cease
that
game
it
is
very
bad
for
you
there
is
nobody
alive
who
is
honest
enough
to
play
a
game
of
chess
fairly
out
right
hand
against
left
we
are
so
radically
dishonest
that
we
even
cheat
ourselves
we
can
no
more
play
chess
than
we
can
think
altogether
by
ourselves
with
security
you
had
much
better
play
with
well
but
you
will
beat
me
i
have
not
much
practice
replied
the
other
they
reset
the
men
and
began
to
play
sherman
relied
most
upon
his
bishops
and
queen
howard
was
fondest
of
the
knights
at
first
sherman
was
the
attacking
party
but
in
his
characteristic
desire
to
scheme
out
his
game
many
moves
ahead
kept
making
slips
and
at
last
had
to
give
up
with
his
men
nearly
all
gone
and
his
king
hopelessly
cornered
howard
seemed
to
let
nothing
escape
him
when
the
game
was
finished
he
leant
back
in
his
chair
and
said
as
he
rolled
a
cigarette
do
not
play
it
gave
him
satisfaction
to
feel
his
proficiency
in
many
small
arts
do
not
do
any
of
these
things
at
all
well
he
went
on
with
an
insolence
peculiar
to
him
when
excited
have
been
really
very
badly
brought
up
and
stupidly
educated
in
that
intolerable
ballah
they
do
not
understand
there
any
even
the
least
of
the
arts
of
life
they
only
believe
in
information
men
who
are
compelled
to
move
in
the
great
world
and
who
are
also
cultivated
only
value
the
personal
acquirements
adaptability
how
to
dress
well
how
even
to
play
tennis
decently
you
would
be
not
so
bad
at
that
by
the
by
if
you
practised
or
how
to
paint
or
write
effectively
they
know
that
it
is
better
to
smoke
cigarette
with
a
certain
charm
of
gesture
than
to
have
by
heart
all
the
encyclopedias
i
say
this
not
merely
as
a
man
of
the
world
but
as
a
teacher
of
religion
a
man
when
he
rises
from
the
grave
will
take
with
him
only
the
things
that
he
is
in
himself
he
will
leave
behind
the
things
that
he
merely
possesses
learning
and
information
not
less
than
money
and
high
estate
they
will
stay
behind
with
his
house
and
his
clothes
and
his
body
a
collection
of
facts
will
no
more
help
him
than
a
collection
of
stamps
the
learned
will
not
get
into
heaven
as
readily
as
the
or
even
as
the
man
who
smokes
a
cigarette
gracefully
now
you
are
not
learned
but
you
have
been
brought
up
almost
as
badly
as
if
you
were
in
that
wretched
town
they
told
you
that
education
was
to
know
that
russia
is
bounded
on
the
north
by
the
arctic
sea
and
on
the
west
by
the
baltic
ocean
and
that
vienna
is
situated
on
the
danube
and
that
william
the
third
came
to
the
throne
in
the
year
they
have
never
taught
you
any
personal
art
even
might
have
helped
you
at
the
day
of
am
really
not
a
worse
than
you
i
am
only
more
there
was
a
slight
resentment
in
voice
the
other
noticed
it
and
said
changing
his
manner
from
the
insolent
air
of
a
young
beauty
to
a
one
which
was
wont
to
give
him
at
times
a
very
genuine
charm
is
really
a
great
pity
for
you
shermans
are
a
deep
people
much
deeper
than
we
howards
we
are
like
moths
or
butterflies
or
rather
rapid
rivulets
while
you
and
yours
are
deep
pools
in
the
forest
where
the
beasts
go
to
drink
no
i
have
a
better
metaphor
your
mind
and
mine
are
two
arrows
yours
has
got
no
feathers
and
mine
has
no
metal
on
the
point
i
know
which
is
most
needed
for
right
conduct
i
wonder
where
we
are
going
to
strike
earth
i
suppose
it
will
be
all
right
some
day
when
the
world
has
gone
by
and
they
have
collected
all
the
arrows
into
one
he
went
over
to
the
mantelpiece
to
hunt
for
a
match
as
his
cigarette
had
gone
out
sherman
had
lifted
a
corner
of
the
blind
and
was
gazing
over
the
roofs
shining
from
a
recent
shower
and
thinking
how
on
such
a
night
as
this
he
had
sat
with
mary
carton
by
the
rectory
fire
listening
to
the
rain
without
and
talking
of
the
future
and
of
the
training
of
village
children
you
seen
miss
leland
in
her
last
new
dress
from
paris
said
howard
making
one
of
his
rapid
transitions
is
very
rich
in
colour
and
makes
her
look
a
little
pale
like
saint
cecilia
she
is
wonderful
as
she
stands
by
the
piano
a
silver
cross
round
her
neck
we
have
been
talking
about
you
she
complains
to
me
she
says
you
are
a
little
barbarous
you
seem
to
look
down
on
style
and
sometimes
you
must
forgive
me
even
on
manners
and
you
are
quite
without
small
talk
you
must
really
try
and
be
worthy
of
that
beautiful
girl
with
her
great
soul
and
religious
genius
she
told
me
quite
sadly
too
that
you
are
not
said
sherman
am
not
going
forward
i
am
at
present
trying
to
go
sideways
like
the
serious
answered
the
other
told
me
these
things
with
the
most
sad
and
touching
voice
she
makes
me
her
confidant
you
know
in
many
matters
because
of
my
wide
religious
experience
you
must
really
improve
yourself
you
must
paint
or
i
will
paint
or
am
quite
serious
sherman
try
and
be
worthy
of
her
a
soul
as
gentle
as
saint
is
very
wealthy
said
sherman
she
were
engaged
to
you
and
not
to
me
you
might
hope
to
die
a
howard
looked
at
him
in
a
mystified
way
and
the
conversation
dropped
presently
howard
got
up
and
went
to
his
room
and
sherman
resetting
the
began
to
play
again
and
letting
longer
and
longer
pauses
of
reverie
come
between
his
moves
played
far
into
the
morning
cheating
now
in
favour
of
the
red
men
now
in
favour
of
the
white
v
the
next
afternoon
howard
found
miss
leland
sitting
reading
in
an
alcove
in
her
between
a
stuffed
parroquet
and
a
blue
de
morgan
jar
as
he
was
shown
in
he
noticed
with
a
momentary
shock
that
her
features
were
quite
commonplace
then
she
saw
him
and
at
once
seemed
to
vanish
wrapped
in
an
exulting
flame
of
life
she
stood
up
flinging
the
book
on
to
the
seat
with
some
violence
have
been
reading
the
of
christ
and
was
just
feeling
that
i
should
have
to
become
a
theosophist
or
a
socialist
or
go
and
join
the
catholic
church
or
do
something
how
delightful
it
is
to
see
you
again
how
is
my
savage
getting
on
it
is
so
good
of
you
to
try
and
help
me
to
reform
they
talked
on
about
sherman
and
howard
did
his
best
to
console
her
for
his
shortcomings
time
would
certainly
improve
her
savage
several
times
she
gazed
at
him
with
those
large
dark
eyes
of
hers
of
which
the
pupils
seemed
larger
than
usual
they
made
him
feel
dizzy
and
clutch
tightly
the
arm
of
his
chair
then
she
began
to
talk
about
her
life
since
childhood
how
they
got
to
the
subject
he
never
knew
and
made
a
number
of
those
confidences
which
are
so
dangerous
because
so
flattering
to
love
there
is
nothing
else
worth
living
for
but
then
men
are
so
shallow
she
had
never
found
a
nature
deep
as
her
own
she
would
not
pretend
that
she
had
not
often
been
in
love
but
never
had
any
heart
rung
back
to
her
the
true
note
as
she
spoke
her
face
quivered
with
excitement
the
exulting
flame
of
life
seemed
spreading
from
her
to
the
other
things
in
the
room
to
eyes
it
seemed
as
though
the
bright
pots
and
stuffed
birds
and
plush
curtains
began
to
glow
with
a
light
not
of
this
world
to
glimmer
like
the
strange
and
chaotic
colours
the
mystic
blake
imagined
upon
the
scaled
serpent
of
eden
the
light
seemed
gradually
to
dim
his
past
and
future
and
to
make
pale
his
good
resolves
was
it
not
in
itself
that
which
all
men
are
seeking
and
for
which
all
else
exists
he
leant
forward
and
took
her
hand
timidly
and
doubtingly
she
did
not
draw
it
away
he
leant
nearer
and
kissed
her
on
the
forehead
she
gave
a
joyful
cry
and
casting
her
arms
round
his
neck
burst
out
you
and
i
we
were
made
for
each
other
i
hate
sherman
he
is
an
egotist
he
is
a
beast
he
is
selfish
and
releasing
one
of
her
arms
she
struck
the
seat
with
her
hand
excitedly
and
went
on
angry
he
will
be
but
it
serves
him
right
how
badly
he
is
dressing
he
does
not
know
anything
about
anything
but
you
you
i
knew
you
were
meant
for
me
the
moment
i
saw
that
evening
howard
flung
himself
into
a
chair
in
the
empty
he
lighted
a
cigarette
it
went
out
again
he
lighted
it
again
it
went
out
am
a
traitor
and
that
good
stupid
fellow
sherman
never
to
be
jealous
he
thought
then
how
could
i
help
it
and
besides
it
can
not
be
a
bad
action
to
save
her
from
a
man
she
is
so
much
above
in
refinement
and
he
was
getting
into
with
himself
he
got
up
and
went
over
and
looked
at
the
photograph
of
madonna
which
he
had
hung
over
the
mantelpiece
like
are
her
big
eyes
vi
the
next
day
when
sherman
came
home
from
his
office
he
saw
an
envelope
lying
on
the
table
it
contained
a
letter
from
howard
saying
that
he
had
gone
away
and
that
he
hoped
sherman
would
forgive
his
treachery
but
that
he
was
hopelessly
in
love
with
miss
leland
and
that
she
returned
his
love
sherman
went
downstairs
his
mother
was
helping
the
servant
to
set
the
table
will
never
guess
what
has
happened
he
said
affair
with
margaret
is
can
not
pretend
to
be
sorry
john
she
replied
she
had
long
considered
miss
leland
among
accepted
things
like
the
on
the
roof
and
submitted
as
we
do
to
any
unalterable
fact
but
had
never
praised
her
or
expressed
liking
in
any
way
puts
belladonna
in
her
eyes
and
is
a
vixen
and
a
flirt
and
i
dare
say
her
wealth
is
all
talk
but
how
did
it
happen
her
son
was
however
too
excited
to
listen
he
went
upstairs
and
wrote
the
following
note
dear
margaret
congratulate
you
on
a
new
conquest
there
is
no
end
to
your
victories
as
for
me
i
bow
myself
out
with
many
sincere
wishes
for
your
happiness
and
remain
your
friend
john
having
posted
this
letter
he
sat
down
with
note
spread
out
before
him
and
wondered
whether
there
was
anything
mean
and
in
neatness
he
himself
was
somewhat
untidy
he
had
often
thought
so
before
for
their
strong
friendship
was
founded
in
a
great
measure
on
mutual
contempt
but
now
immediately
added
being
in
with
the
world
is
much
cleverer
than
i
am
he
must
have
been
very
industrious
at
a
week
went
by
he
made
up
his
mind
to
put
an
end
to
his
london
life
he
broke
to
his
mother
his
resolve
to
return
to
ballah
she
was
delighted
and
at
once
began
to
pack
her
old
home
had
long
seemed
to
her
a
kind
of
lost
eden
wherewith
she
was
accustomed
to
contrast
the
present
when
in
time
this
present
had
grown
into
the
past
it
became
an
eden
in
turn
she
was
always
ready
for
a
change
if
the
change
came
to
her
in
the
form
of
a
return
to
something
old
others
place
their
ideals
in
the
future
she
laid
hers
in
the
past
the
only
one
this
momentous
resolution
seemed
to
surprise
was
the
old
and
deaf
servant
she
waited
with
impatience
she
would
sit
by
the
hour
on
the
corner
of
a
chair
with
a
look
of
bewildered
delight
as
the
hour
of
departure
came
near
she
sang
continually
in
a
cracked
voice
sherman
a
few
days
before
leaving
was
returning
for
the
last
time
from
his
office
when
he
saw
to
his
surprise
howard
and
miss
leland
carrying
each
a
bundle
he
nodded
meaning
to
pass
on
she
said
at
this
brooch
william
gave
me
a
ladder
leaning
against
the
moon
and
a
butterfly
climbing
up
it
is
it
not
sweet
we
are
going
to
visit
the
i
he
said
going
to
catch
eels
i
am
leaving
he
made
his
excuses
saying
he
had
no
time
to
wait
and
hurried
off
she
looked
after
him
with
a
mournful
glance
strange
in
anybody
who
had
exchanged
one
lover
for
another
more
favoured
fellow
murmured
howard
is
answered
miss
leland
somewhat
snappishly
fifth
part
john
sherman
returns
to
ballah
i
this
being
the
homeward
trip
ss
carried
no
cattle
but
many
passengers
as
the
sea
was
smooth
and
the
voyage
near
its
end
they
lounged
about
the
deck
in
groups
two
were
leaning
over
the
taffrail
smoking
in
appearance
they
were
something
between
and
commercial
travellers
for
years
they
had
done
all
their
sleeping
in
steamers
and
trains
a
short
distance
from
them
a
clerk
from
liverpool
with
a
consumptive
cough
walked
to
and
fro
a
little
child
holding
his
hand
shortly
he
would
be
landed
in
a
boat
putting
off
from
the
shore
for
the
purpose
he
had
come
hoping
that
his
native
air
of
teeling
head
would
restore
him
the
little
child
was
a
strange
contrast
her
cheeks
ruddy
with
perfect
health
further
forward
talking
to
one
of
the
crew
was
a
man
with
a
red
face
and
slightly
unsteady
step
in
the
was
a
governess
past
her
first
youth
very
much
afraid
of
she
had
brought
her
luggage
up
and
heaped
it
round
her
to
be
ready
for
landing
sherman
sat
on
a
pile
of
cable
looking
out
over
the
sea
it
was
just
noon
ss
having
passed
by
tory
and
rathlin
was
approaching
the
donegal
cliffs
they
were
covered
by
a
faint
mist
which
made
them
loom
even
vaster
than
they
were
to
westward
the
sun
shone
on
a
perfectly
blue
sea
seagulls
came
out
of
the
mist
and
plunged
into
the
sunlight
and
out
of
the
sunlight
and
plunged
into
the
mist
to
the
westward
gannets
were
striking
continually
and
a
porpoise
showed
now
and
then
his
fin
and
back
gleaming
in
the
sun
sherman
was
more
perfectly
happy
than
he
had
been
for
many
a
day
and
more
ardently
thinking
all
nature
seemed
full
of
a
divine
fulfilment
everything
fulfilled
its
law
fulfilment
that
is
peace
whether
it
be
for
good
or
for
evil
for
evil
also
has
its
peace
the
peace
of
the
birds
of
prey
sherman
looked
from
the
sea
to
the
ship
and
grew
sad
upon
this
thing
crawling
slowly
along
the
sea
moved
to
and
fro
many
mournful
and
slouching
figures
he
looked
from
the
ship
to
himself
and
his
eyes
filled
with
tears
on
himself
on
these
moving
figures
hope
and
memory
fed
like
flames
again
his
eyes
gladdened
for
he
knew
he
had
found
his
present
he
would
live
in
his
love
and
the
day
as
it
passed
he
would
live
that
his
law
might
be
fulfilled
now
was
he
sure
of
this
truth
the
saints
on
the
one
hand
the
animals
on
the
other
live
in
the
moment
as
it
passes
thitherward
had
his
days
brought
him
this
was
the
one
grain
they
had
ground
to
grind
one
grain
is
sufficient
for
a
lifetime
ii
a
few
days
later
sherman
was
hurrying
through
the
town
of
ballah
it
was
saturday
and
he
passed
down
through
the
marketing
country
people
and
the
old
women
with
baskets
of
cakes
and
gooseberries
and
long
pieces
of
sugarstick
shaped
like
and
called
by
children
now
as
two
months
earlier
he
was
occasionally
recognized
and
greeted
and
as
before
went
on
without
knowing
his
eyes
full
of
unintelligent
sadness
because
the
mind
was
making
merry
afar
they
had
the
look
we
see
in
the
eyes
of
animals
and
dreamers
everything
had
grown
simple
his
problem
had
taken
itself
away
he
was
thinking
what
he
would
say
to
mary
carton
now
they
would
be
married
they
would
live
in
a
small
house
with
a
green
door
and
new
thatch
and
a
row
of
beehives
under
a
hedge
he
knew
where
just
such
a
house
stood
empty
the
day
before
he
and
his
mother
had
discussed
with
their
host
of
the
imperial
hotel
this
question
of
houses
they
knew
the
peculiarities
of
every
house
in
the
neighbourhood
except
two
or
three
built
while
they
were
away
all
day
sherman
and
his
mother
had
gone
over
the
merits
of
the
few
they
were
told
were
empty
she
wondered
why
her
son
had
grown
so
unpractical
once
he
was
so
easily
pleased
the
row
of
beehives
and
the
new
thatch
did
not
for
her
settle
the
question
she
set
it
all
down
to
miss
leland
and
the
plays
and
the
singing
and
the
belladonna
and
remembered
with
pleasure
how
many
miles
of
uneasy
water
lay
between
the
town
of
ballah
and
these
things
she
did
not
know
what
else
beside
the
row
of
beehives
and
the
new
thatch
her
mind
ran
on
as
he
walked
among
the
marketing
country
people
and
the
gooseberry
sellers
and
the
merchants
of
leg
and
the
boys
playing
marbles
in
odd
corners
and
the
men
in
waistcoats
with
flannel
sleeves
driving
carts
and
the
women
driving
donkeys
with
creels
of
turf
or
churns
of
milk
just
now
she
was
trying
to
remember
whether
she
used
to
buy
her
wool
for
knitting
at
miss
or
from
at
the
bridge
one
or
other
sold
it
a
halfpenny
a
skein
cheaper
she
never
knew
what
went
on
inside
her
mind
she
had
always
her
own
fish
to
fry
blessed
are
the
unsympathetic
they
preserve
their
characters
in
an
iron
bottle
while
the
most
of
us
poor
mortals
are
going
about
the
planet
vainly
searching
for
any
kind
of
a
shell
to
contain
us
and
evaporating
the
while
sherman
began
to
mount
the
hill
to
the
vicarage
he
was
happy
because
he
was
happy
he
began
to
run
soon
the
steepness
of
the
hill
made
him
walk
he
thought
about
his
love
for
mary
carton
seen
by
the
light
of
this
love
everything
that
had
happened
to
him
was
plain
now
he
had
found
his
centre
of
unity
his
childhood
had
prepared
him
for
this
love
he
had
been
solitary
fond
of
favourite
corners
of
fields
fond
of
going
about
alone
unhuman
like
the
birds
and
the
leaves
his
heart
empty
how
clearly
he
remembered
his
first
meeting
with
mary
they
were
both
children
at
a
school
treat
they
watched
the
ascend
and
followed
it
a
little
way
over
the
fields
together
what
friends
they
became
growing
up
together
reading
the
same
books
thinking
the
same
thoughts
as
he
came
to
the
door
and
pulled
at
the
great
hanging
iron
the
reascended
in
his
heart
surrounded
with
cheers
and
laughter
iii
he
kept
the
servant
talking
for
a
moment
or
two
before
she
went
for
miss
carton
the
old
rector
she
told
him
was
getting
less
and
less
able
to
do
much
work
old
age
had
come
almost
suddenly
upon
him
he
seldom
moved
from
the
fireside
he
was
getting
more
and
more
once
lately
he
had
brought
his
umbrella
into
the
more
and
more
did
he
leave
all
things
to
his
children
to
mary
carton
and
her
younger
sisters
when
the
servant
had
gone
sherman
looked
round
the
somewhat
gloomy
room
in
the
window
hung
a
canary
in
a
painted
cage
outside
was
a
narrow
piece
of
shaded
ground
between
the
window
and
the
rectory
wall
the
laurel
and
holly
bushes
darkened
the
window
a
good
deal
on
a
table
in
the
centre
of
the
room
were
evangelistic
books
with
gilded
covers
round
the
mirror
over
the
mantelpiece
were
stuck
various
parish
announcements
thrust
between
the
glass
and
the
gilding
on
a
small
was
a
copper
how
familiar
everything
seemed
to
sherman
only
the
room
seemed
smaller
than
it
did
three
years
before
and
close
to
the
table
with
the
at
one
side
of
the
fireplace
before
the
was
a
new
threadbare
patch
in
the
carpet
sherman
recalled
how
in
this
room
he
and
mary
carton
had
sat
in
winter
by
the
fire
building
castles
in
the
air
for
each
other
so
deeply
meditating
was
he
that
she
came
in
and
stood
unnoticed
beside
him
she
said
at
last
is
a
great
pleasure
to
see
you
so
soon
again
are
you
doing
well
in
london

left
you

must
introduce
me

howard

have
come
here
to
tell
you

went
and
stood
close
to
her
and
took
her
hand
tenderly
have
always
been
very
fond
of
you
often
in
london
when
i
was
trying
to
think
of
another
kind
of
life
i
used
to
see
this
fireside
and
you
sitting
beside
it
where
we
used
to
sit
and
talk
about
the
future
mary
mary
he
held
her
hand
in
both
his
will

she
answered
drawing
herself
away

come
to
me
because
you
think
it
your
duty
i
have
had
nothing
but
duty
all
my
he
said
was
very
miserable
i
invited
howard
to
stay
with
us
one
morning
i
found
a
note
on
the
table
to
say
that
margaret
had
accepted
him
and
i
have
come
here
to
ask
you
to
marry
me
i
never
cared
for
anyone
he
found
himself
speaking
hurriedly
as
though
anxious
to
get
the
words
said
and
done
with
it
now
seemed
to
him
that
he
had
done
ill
in
this
matter
of
miss
leland
he
had
not
before
thought
of
it
his
mind
had
always
been
busy
with
other
things
mary
carton
looked
at
him
wonderingly
she
said
at
last
you
ask
howard
to
stay
with
you
on
purpose
to
get
him
to
fall
in
love
with
miss
leland
or
to
give
you
an
excuse
for
breaking
off
your
engagement
as
you
knew
he
flirted
with
everyone
seems
very
fond
of
him
i
think
they
are
made
for
each
other
he
answered
you
ask
him
to
london
on
purpose
i
will
tell
you
he
faltered
was
very
miserable
i
had
drifted
into
this
engagement
i
know
how
margaret
glitters
and
glitters
and
glitters
but
she
is
not
of
my
kind
i
suppose
i
thought
like
a
fool
i
should
marry
someone
who
was
rich
i
found
out
soon
that
i
loved
nobody
but
you
i
got
to
be
always
thinking
of
you
and
of
this
town
then
i
heard
that
howard
had
lost
his
curacy
and
asked
him
up
i
just
left
them
alone
and
did
not
go
near
margaret
much
i
knew
they
were
made
for
each
other
do
not
let
us
talk
of
them
he
continued
eagerly
us
talk
about
the
future
i
will
take
a
farm
and
turn
farmer
i
dare
say
my
uncle
will
not
give
me
anything
when
he
dies
because
i
have
left
his
office
he
will
call
me
a
and
say
i
would
squander
it
but
you
and
i
we
will
get
married
will
we
not
we
will
be
very
happy
he
went
on
pleadingly
will
still
have
your
charities
and
i
shall
be
busy
with
my
farm
we
will
surround
ourselves
with
a
wall
the
world
will
be
on
the
outside
and
on
the
inside
we
and
our
peaceful
she
said
will
give
you
your
answer
and
going
into
the
next
room
returned
with
several
bundles
of
letters
she
laid
them
on
the
table
some
were
white
and
new
some
slightly
yellow
with
time
she
said
growing
very
pale
are
all
the
letters
you
ever
wrote
me
from
your
earliest
she
took
one
of
the
large
candles
from
the
mantelpiece
and
lighting
it
placed
it
on
the
hearth
sherman
wondered
what
she
was
going
to
do
with
it
will
tell
you
she
went
on
i
had
thought
to
carry
to
the
grave
unspoken
i
have
loved
you
for
a
long
time
when
you
came
and
told
me
you
were
going
to
be
married
to
another
i
forgave
you
for
love
is
like
the
wind
and
i
prayed
that
god
might
bless
you
she
leant
down
over
the
candle
her
face
pale
and
contorted
with
emotion
these
letters
after
that
grew
very
sacred
since
we
were
never
to
be
married
they
grew
a
portion
of
my
life
separated
from
everything
and
everyone
a
something
apart
and
holy
i
them
all
and
arranged
them
in
little
bundles
according
to
their
dates
and
tied
them
with
thread
now
i
and
you
we
have
nothing
to
do
with
each
other
any
she
held
the
bundle
of
letters
in
the
flame
he
got
up
from
his
seat
she
motioned
him
away
imperiously
he
looked
at
the
flame
in
a
bewildered
way
the
letters
fell
in
little
burning
fragments
about
the
hearth
it
was
all
like
a
terrible
dream
he
watched
those
steady
fingers
hold
letter
after
letter
in
the
candle
flame
and
watched
the
candle
burning
on
like
a
passion
in
the
grey
daylight
of
universal
existence
a
draught
from
under
the
door
began
blowing
the
ash
about
the
room
the
voice
said
tried
to
marry
a
rich
girl
you
did
not
love
her
but
knew
she
was
rich
you
tired
of
her
as
you
tire
of
so
many
things
and
behaved
to
her
most
wrongly
most
wickedly
and
treacherously
when
you
were
jilted
you
came
again
to
me
and
to
the
idleness
of
this
little
town
we
had
all
hoped
great
things
of
you
you
seemed
good
and
loved
you
all
along
he
cried
you
would
marry
me
we
would
be
very
happy
i
loved
you
all
along
he
repeated
this
helplessly
several
times
over
the
bird
shook
a
shower
of
seed
on
his
shoulder
he
picked
one
of
them
from
the
collar
of
his
coat
and
turned
it
over
in
his
fingers
mechanically
loved
you
all
have
done
no
duty
that
came
to
you
you
have
tired
of
everything
you
should
cling
to
and
now
you
have
come
to
this
little
town
because
here
is
idleness
and
the
last
letter
lay
in
ashes
on
the
hearth
she
blew
out
the
candle
and
replaced
it
among
the
photographs
on
the
mantelpiece
and
stood
there
as
calm
as
a
portion
of
the
marble
our
friendship
is
over
it
has
been
burnt
in
the
he
started
forward
his
mind
full
of
appeals
with
despair
on
his
lips
gathered
incoherent
words
will
be
happy
with
howard
they
were
made
for
each
other
i
slipped
into
it
i
always
thought
i
should
marry
someone
who
was
rich
i
never
loved
anyone
but
you
i
did
not
know
i
loved
you
at
first
i
thought
about
you
always
you
are
the
root
of
my
steps
were
heard
outside
the
door
at
the
end
of
a
passage
mary
carton
went
to
the
door
and
called
the
steps
turned
and
came
nearer
with
a
great
effort
sherman
controlled
himself
the
door
opened
and
a
tall
slight
girl
of
twelve
came
into
the
room
a
strong
smell
of
garden
mould
rose
from
a
basket
in
her
hands
sherman
recognized
the
child
who
had
given
him
tea
that
evening
in
the
schoolhouse
three
years
before
you
finished
weeding
the
carrots
said
mary
carton
you
are
to
weed
the
small
bed
under
the
by
the
do
not
go
yet
child
this
is
sherman
sit
down
a
the
child
sat
down
on
the
corner
of
a
chair
with
a
scared
look
in
her
eyes
suddenly
she
said
what
a
lot
of
burnt
paper
i
have
been
burning
some
old
think
said
john
will
go
without
a
word
of
farewell
he
went
out
almost
groping
his
way
he
had
lost
the
best
of
all
the
things
he
held
dear
twice
he
had
gone
through
the
fire
the
first
time
worldly
ambition
left
him
the
second
love
an
hour
before
the
air
had
been
full
of
singing
and
peace
that
was
resonant
like
joy
now
he
saw
standing
before
his
eden
the
angel
with
the
flaming
sword
all
the
hope
he
had
ever
gathered
about
him
had
taken
itself
off
and
the
naked
soul
shivered
iv
the
road
under
his
feet
felt
gritty
and
barren
he
hurried
away
from
the
town
it
was
late
afternoon
trees
cast
bands
of
shadow
across
the
road
he
walked
rapidly
as
if
pursued
about
a
mile
to
the
west
of
the
town
he
came
on
a
large
wood
bordering
the
road
and
surrounding
a
deserted
house
some
local
rich
man
once
lived
there
now
it
was
given
over
to
a
caretaker
who
lived
in
two
rooms
in
the
back
part
men
were
at
work
cutting
down
trees
in
two
or
three
parts
of
the
wood
many
places
were
quite
bare
a
mass
of
ruins
a
covered
well
and
the
wreckage
of
castle
wall
that
had
been
roofed
with
green
for
centuries
lifted
themselves
up
bare
as
anatomies
the
sight
intensified
by
some
strange
sympathy
his
sorrow
and
he
hurried
away
as
from
a
thing
accursed
of
god
the
road
led
to
the
foot
of
a
mountain
topped
by
a
cairn
supposed
in
popular
belief
to
be
the
grave
of
maeve
mab
of
the
fairies
and
considered
by
antiquarians
to
mark
the
place
where
certain
prisoners
were
executed
in
legendary
times
as
sacrifices
to
the
moon
he
began
to
climb
the
mountain
the
sun
was
on
the
rim
of
the
sea
it
stayed
there
without
moving
for
as
he
ascended
he
saw
an
circle
of
water
he
threw
himself
down
upon
the
cairn
the
sun
sank
under
the
sea
the
donegal
headlands
mixed
with
the
surrounding
blue
the
stars
grew
out
of
heaven
sometimes
he
got
up
and
walked
to
and
fro
hours
passed
the
stars
the
streams
down
in
the
valley
the
wind
moving
among
the
boulders
the
various
unknown
creatures
rustling
in
the
silence
all
these
were
contained
within
themselves
fulfilling
their
law
content
to
be
alone
content
to
be
with
others
having
the
peace
of
god
or
the
peace
of
the
birds
of
prey
he
only
did
not
fulfil
his
law
something
that
was
not
he
that
was
not
nature
that
was
not
god
had
made
him
and
her
he
loved
its
tools
hope
memory
tradition
conformity
had
been
laying
waste
their
lives
as
he
thought
this
the
night
seemed
to
crush
him
with
its
purple
foot
hour
followed
hour
at
midnight
he
started
up
hearing
a
faint
murmur
of
clocks
striking
the
hour
in
the
distant
town
his
face
and
hands
were
wet
with
tears
his
clothes
saturated
with
dew
he
turned
homeward
hurriedly
flying
from
the
terrible
firmament
what
had
this
glimmering
and
silence
to
do
with
him
this
luxurious
present
he
belonged
to
the
past
and
the
future
with
pace
somewhat
slackened
because
of
the
furze
he
came
down
into
the
valley
along
the
northern
horizon
moved
a
perpetual
dawn
travelling
eastward
as
the
night
advanced
once
as
he
passed
a
marsh
near
a
a
number
of
small
birds
rose
chirruping
from
where
they
had
been
clinging
among
the
reeds
once
standing
still
for
a
moment
where
two
roads
crossed
on
a
he
looked
out
over
the
dark
fields
a
white
stone
rose
in
the
middle
of
a
field
a
score
of
yards
in
front
of
him
he
knew
the
place
well
it
was
an
ancient
he
looked
at
the
stone
and
suddenly
filled
by
the
terror
of
the
darkness
children
feel
began
again
his
hurried
walk
he
ballah
by
the
southern
side
in
passing
he
looked
at
the
rectory
to
his
surprise
a
light
burned
in
the
he
stood
still
the
dawn
was
brightening
towards
the
east
but
all
round
him
was
darkness
seeming
the
more
intense
to
his
eyes
for
their
being
fresh
from
the
unshaded
fields
in
the
midst
of
this
darkness
shone
the
lighted
window
he
went
over
to
the
gate
and
looked
in
the
room
was
empty
he
was
about
to
turn
away
when
he
noticed
a
white
figure
standing
close
to
the
gate
the
latch
creaked
and
the
gate
moved
slowly
on
its
hinges
said
a
trembling
voice
have
been
praying
and
a
light
has
come
to
me
i
wished
you
to
be
ambitious
to
go
away
and
do
something
in
the
world
you
did
badly
and
my
poor
pride
was
wounded
you
do
not
know
how
much
i
had
hoped
from
you
but
it
was
all
pride
all
pride
and
foolishness
you
love
me
i
ask
no
more
we
need
each
other
the
rest
is
with
she
took
his
hand
in
hers
and
began
caressing
it
have
been
shipwrecked
our
goods
have
been
cast
into
the
something
in
her
voice
told
of
the
emotion
that
divides
the
love
of
woman
from
the
love
of
man
she
looked
upon
him
whom
she
loved
as
full
of
a
helplessness
that
needed
protection
a
reverberation
of
the
feeling
of
the
mother
for
the
child
at
the
breast
dhoya
i
long
ago
before
the
earliest
stone
of
the
pyramids
was
laid
before
the
bo
tree
of
buddha
unrolled
its
first
leaf
before
a
japanese
had
painted
on
a
temple
wall
the
horse
that
every
evening
descended
and
trampled
the
before
the
ravens
of
thor
had
eaten
their
first
worm
together
there
lived
a
man
of
giant
stature
and
of
giant
strength
named
dhoya
one
evening
fomorian
galleys
had
entered
the
bay
of
the
red
cataract
now
the
bay
of
ballah
and
there
deserted
him
though
he
rushed
into
the
water
and
hurled
great
stones
after
them
they
were
out
of
reach
from
earliest
childhood
the
fomorians
had
held
him
captive
and
compelled
him
to
toil
at
the
oar
but
when
his
strength
had
come
his
fits
of
passion
made
him
a
terror
to
all
on
board
sometimes
he
would
tear
the
seats
of
the
galley
from
under
the
rowers
and
drive
the
rowers
up
into
the
shrouds
where
they
would
cling
until
the
passion
left
him
demons
they
said
made
him
their
so
they
enticed
him
on
shore
he
having
on
his
head
a
mighty
stone
pitcher
to
fill
with
water
and
deserted
him
when
the
last
sail
had
dropped
over
the
rim
of
the
world
he
rose
from
where
he
had
flung
himself
down
on
the
sands
and
hurried
through
the
forest
eastward
after
a
time
he
reached
that
lake
among
the
mountains
where
in
later
times
diarmuid
drove
down
four
stakes
and
made
thereon
a
platform
with
four
flags
in
the
centre
for
a
hearth
and
placed
over
all
a
roof
of
wicker
and
skins
and
hid
his
grania
islanded
thereon
still
eastward
he
went
what
is
now
bulben
on
one
side
mountain
on
the
other
until
at
last
he
threw
himself
at
full
length
in
a
deep
cavern
and
slept
henceforward
he
made
this
cavern
his
lair
issuing
forth
to
hunt
the
deer
or
the
bears
or
the
mountain
oxen
slowly
the
years
went
by
his
fits
of
fury
growing
more
and
more
frequent
though
there
was
no
one
but
his
own
shadow
to
rave
against
when
his
fury
was
on
him
even
the
bats
and
owls
and
the
brown
frogs
that
crept
out
of
the
grass
at
twilight
would
hide
themselves
even
the
bats
and
owls
and
the
brown
frogs
these
he
had
made
his
friends
and
let
them
crawl
and
perch
about
him
for
at
times
he
would
be
very
gentle
and
they
too
were
sullen
and
silent
the
outcasts
from
they
knew
not
what
but
most
of
all
things
placid
and
beautiful
feared
him
he
would
watch
for
hours
hidden
in
the
leaves
to
reach
his
hand
out
slowly
and
carefully
at
last
and
seize
and
crush
some
glittering
halcyon
slowly
the
years
went
by
and
human
face
he
never
saw
but
sometimes
when
the
gentle
mood
was
on
him
and
it
was
twilight
a
presence
seemed
to
float
invisibly
by
him
and
sigh
softly
and
once
or
twice
he
awoke
from
sleep
with
the
sensation
of
a
finger
having
rested
for
a
moment
on
his
forehead
and
would
mutter
a
prayer
to
the
moon
that
glimmered
through
the
door
of
his
cave
before
turning
to
sleep
again
moon
he
would
say
wanderest
in
the
blue
cave
of
the
sky
more
white
than
the
beard
of
partholan
whose
years
were
five
hundred
sullen
and
solitary
sleeping
only
on
the
floor
of
the
sea
keep
me
from
the
evil
spirits
of
the
islands
of
the
lake
southward
beyond
the
mountains
and
the
evil
spirits
of
the
caves
northward
beyond
the
mountains
and
the
evil
spirits
who
wave
their
torches
by
the
mouth
of
the
river
eastward
beyond
the
valley
and
the
evil
spirits
of
the
pools
westward
beyond
the
mountains
and
i
will
offer
you
a
bear
and
a
deer
in
full
horn
o
solitary
of
the
cave
divine
and
if
any
have
done
you
wrong
i
will
avenge
gradually
however
he
began
to
long
for
this
mysterious
touch
at
times
he
would
make
journeys
into
distant
parts
and
once
the
mountain
bulls
gathered
together
proud
of
their
overwhelming
numbers
and
their
white
horns
and
followed
him
with
great
bellowing
westward
he
being
laden
with
their
tallest
to
his
cave
and
would
have
gored
him
but
pacing
into
a
pool
of
the
sea
to
his
shoulders
he
saw
them
thunder
away
losing
him
in
the
darkness
the
place
where
he
stood
is
called
pooldhoya
to
this
day
so
the
years
went
slowly
by
and
ever
deeper
and
deeper
came
his
moodiness
and
more
often
his
fits
of
wrath
once
in
his
gloom
he
paced
the
forests
for
miles
now
this
way
now
that
until
returning
in
the
twilight
he
found
himself
standing
on
a
cliff
southward
of
the
lake
that
was
southward
of
the
mountains
the
moon
was
rising
the
sound
of
the
swaying
of
reeds
floated
from
beneath
and
the
twittering
of
the
flocks
of
who
love
to
cling
on
the
moving
stems
it
was
the
hour
of
votaries
he
turned
to
the
moon
then
hurriedly
gathered
a
pile
of
leaves
and
branches
and
making
a
fire
cast
thereon
wild
strawberries
and
the
fruit
of
the
as
the
smoke
floated
upwards
a
bar
of
faint
purple
clouds
drifted
over
the
face
a
refusal
of
the
sacrifice
hurrying
through
the
surrounding
woods
he
found
an
owl
sleeping
in
the
hollow
of
a
tree
and
returning
cast
him
on
the
fire
still
the
clouds
gathered
again
he
searched
the
woods
this
time
it
was
a
badger
that
he
cast
among
the
flames
time
after
time
he
came
and
went
sometimes
returning
immediately
with
some
live
thing
at
others
not
till
the
fire
had
almost
burnt
itself
out
deer
wild
swine
birds
all
to
no
purpose
higher
and
higher
he
piled
the
burning
branches
the
flames
and
the
smoke
waved
and
circled
like
the
lash
of
a
whip
gradually
the
nearer
islands
passed
the
rosy
colour
on
to
their
more
distant
brethren
the
of
the
furthest
reed
beds
disturbed
amid
their
sleep
must
have
wondered
at
the
red
gleam
reflected
in
each
eyes
useless
his
toil
the
clouds
covered
the
face
more
and
more
until
when
the
long
was
at
its
brightest
they
drowned
her
completely
in
a
surge
of
unbroken
mist
raging
against
the
fire
he
scattered
with
his
staff
the
burning
branches
and
trampled
in
his
fury
the
sacrificial
embers
beneath
his
feet
suddenly
a
voice
in
the
surrounding
darkness
called
him
softly
by
name
he
turned
for
years
no
articulate
voice
had
sounded
in
his
ears
it
seemed
to
rise
from
the
air
just
beneath
the
verge
of
the
precipice
holding
by
a
hazel
bush
he
leaned
out
and
for
a
moment
it
seemed
to
him
the
form
of
a
beautiful
woman
floated
faintly
before
him
but
changed
as
he
watched
to
a
little
cloud
of
vapour
and
from
the
nearest
of
the
haunted
islands
there
came
assuredly
a
whiff
of
music
then
behind
him
in
the
forest
said
the
voice
my
he
rushed
in
pursuit
something
white
was
moving
before
him
he
stretched
out
his
hand
it
was
only
a
mass
of
white
campion
trembling
in
the
morning
breeze
for
an
ashen
morning
was
just
touching
the
mists
on
the
eastern
mountains
beginning
suddenly
to
tremble
with
supernatural
fear
dhoya
turned
homewards
everything
was
changed
dark
shadows
seemed
to
come
and
go
and
elfin
chatter
to
pass
upon
the
breeze
but
when
he
reached
the
shelter
of
the
pine
woods
all
was
still
as
of
old
he
slackened
his
speed
those
solemn
soothed
him
with
their
vast
unsociability
many
and
yet
each
one
alone
once
or
twice
when
in
some
glade
further
than
usual
from
its
kind
arose
a
larger
than
the
rest
he
paused
with
bowed
head
to
mutter
an
uncouth
prayer
to
that
dark
outlaw
as
he
neared
his
cave
and
came
from
the
deep
shade
into
the
region
of
and
hazel
the
voices
seemed
again
to
come
and
go
and
the
shadows
to
circle
round
him
and
once
a
voice
said
he
imagined
in
accents
faint
and
soft
as
falling
dew
my
but
a
few
yards
from
the
cave
all
grew
suddenly
silent
ii
slower
and
slower
he
went
with
his
eyes
on
the
ground
bewildered
by
all
that
was
happening
a
few
feet
from
the
cave
he
stood
still
counting
aimlessly
the
round
spots
of
light
made
by
the
beams
slanting
through
trees
that
hid
with
their
greenness
as
in
the
centre
of
the
sea
that
hollow
rock
as
over
and
over
he
counted
them
he
heard
first
with
the
ear
only
then
with
the
mind
also
a
footstep
going
to
and
fro
within
the
cave
lifting
his
eyes
he
saw
the
same
figure
seen
on
the
cliff
the
figure
of
a
woman
beautiful
and
young
her
dress
was
white
save
for
a
border
of
feathers
dyed
the
fatal
red
of
the
spirits
she
had
arranged
in
one
corner
the
spears
and
in
the
other
the
brushwood
and
branches
used
for
the
fire
and
spread
upon
the
ground
the
skins
and
now
began
pulling
vainly
at
the
great
stone
pitcher
of
the
fomorians
suddenly
she
saw
him
and
with
a
burst
of
laughter
flung
her
arms
round
his
neck
crying
i
have
left
my
world
far
off
my
people
on
the
floor
of
the
lake
they
are
dancing
and
singing
and
on
the
islands
of
the
lake
always
happy
always
young
always
without
change
i
have
left
them
for
thee
dhoya
for
they
can
not
love
only
the
changing
and
moody
and
angry
and
weary
can
love
i
am
beautiful
love
me
dhoya
do
you
hear
me
i
left
the
places
where
they
dance
dhoya
for
thee
for
long
she
poured
out
a
tide
of
words
he
answering
at
first
little
then
more
and
more
as
she
melted
away
the
silence
of
so
many
inarticulate
years
and
all
the
while
she
gazed
on
him
with
eyes
no
ardour
could
rob
of
the
mild
and
mysterious
melancholy
that
watches
us
from
the
eyes
of
animals
sign
of
unhuman
reveries
many
days
passed
over
these
ones
sometimes
when
he
asked
her
you
love
me
she
would
answer
do
not
know
but
i
long
for
your
love
often
at
twilight
returning
from
hunting
he
would
find
her
bending
over
a
stream
that
flowed
near
to
the
cave
decking
her
hair
with
feathers
and
reddening
her
lips
with
the
juice
of
a
wild
berry
he
was
very
happy
secluded
in
that
deep
forest
hearing
the
faint
murmurs
of
the
western
sea
they
seemed
to
have
outlived
change
but
change
is
everywhere
with
the
tides
and
the
stars
fastened
to
her
wheel
every
in
their
lips
every
cloud
in
the
sky
every
leaf
in
the
world
changed
a
little
while
they
brushed
back
their
hair
and
kissed
all
things
change
save
only
the
fear
of
change
and
yet
for
his
hour
dhoya
was
happy
and
as
full
of
dreams
as
an
old
man
or
an
infant
for
dreams
wander
nearest
to
the
grave
and
the
cradle
once
as
he
was
returning
home
from
hunting
by
the
northern
edge
of
the
lake
at
the
hour
when
the
owls
cry
to
each
other
is
time
to
be
abroad
and
the
last
flutter
of
the
wind
has
died
away
leaving
under
every
haunted
island
an
image
legible
to
the
least
hazel
branch
there
suddenly
stood
before
him
a
slight
figure
at
the
edge
of
the
narrow
dark
against
the
glowing
water
dhoya
drew
nearer
it
was
a
man
leaning
on
his
on
his
head
a
small
red
cap
his
spear
was
slender
and
tipped
with
shining
metal
the
spear
of
dhoya
of
wood
one
end
pointed
and
hardened
in
the
fire
the
stranger
silently
raised
that
slender
spear
and
thrust
at
dhoya
who
parried
with
his
pointed
staff
for
a
long
while
they
fought
the
last
vestige
of
sunset
passed
away
and
the
stars
came
out
underneath
them
the
feet
of
dhoya
beat
up
the
ground
but
the
feet
of
the
other
as
he
rushed
hither
and
thither
matching
his
agility
with
the
mighty
strength
made
neither
shadow
nor
footstep
on
the
sands
dhoya
was
wounded
and
growing
weary
a
little
when
the
other
leaped
away
and
crouching
down
by
the
water
began
have
carried
away
by
some
spell
unknown
the
most
beautiful
of
our
bands
you
who
have
neither
laughter
nor
singing
restore
her
dhoya
and
go
dhoya
answered
him
no
word
and
the
other
rose
and
again
thrust
at
him
with
the
spear
they
fought
to
and
fro
upon
the
sands
until
the
dawn
touched
with
olive
the
distant
sky
and
then
his
long
absent
fell
on
dhoya
and
he
closed
with
his
enemy
and
threw
him
and
put
his
knee
on
his
chest
and
his
hands
on
his
throat
and
would
have
crushed
all
life
out
of
him
when
lo
he
held
beneath
his
knee
no
more
than
a
bundle
of
reeds
nearing
home
in
the
early
morning
he
heard
the
voice
he
loved
singing
full
moody
is
my
love
and
sad
his
moods
bow
low
his
sombre
crest
i
hold
him
dearer
than
the
glad
and
he
shall
slumber
on
my
breast
my
love
hath
many
an
evil
mood
ill
words
for
all
things
soft
and
fair
i
hold
him
dearer
than
the
good
my
fingers
feel
his
amber
hair
no
tender
wisdom
floods
the
eyes
that
watch
me
with
their
suppliant
light
i
hold
him
dearer
than
the
wise
and
for
him
make
me
wise
and
bright
and
when
she
saw
him
she
cried
old
mortal
song
heard
floating
from
a
tent
of
skin
as
we
rode
i
and
mine
through
a
at
from
that
day
she
was
always
either
singing
wild
and
melancholy
songs
or
else
watching
him
with
that
gaze
of
animal
reverie
once
he
asked
old
are
you
thousand
years
for
i
am
am
so
little
to
you
he
went
on
you
are
so
much
to
me
dawn
and
sunset
tranquillity
and
speech
and
i
so
much
she
said
it
many
times
and
her
eyes
seemed
to
brighten
and
her
breast
heaved
with
joy
often
he
would
bring
her
the
beautiful
skins
of
animals
and
she
would
walk
to
and
fro
on
them
laughing
to
feel
their
softness
under
her
feet
sometimes
she
would
pause
and
ask
suddenly
you
weep
for
me
when
we
have
parted
and
he
would
answer
will
die
and
she
would
go
on
rubbing
her
feet
to
and
fro
in
the
soft
skin
and
so
dhoya
grew
tranquil
and
gentle
and
change
seemed
still
to
have
forgotten
them
having
so
much
on
her
hands
the
stars
rose
and
set
watching
them
smiling
together
and
the
tides
ebbed
and
flowed
bringing
mutability
to
all
save
them
but
always
everything
changes
save
only
the
fear
of
change
iii
one
evening
as
they
sat
in
the
inner
portion
of
the
cave
watching
through
the
opening
the
paling
of
the
sky
and
the
darkening
of
the
leaves
and
counting
the
budding
stars
dhoya
suddenly
saw
stand
before
him
the
dark
outline
of
him
he
fought
on
the
lake
sand
and
heard
at
the
same
instant
his
companion
sigh
the
stranger
approached
a
little
and
said
we
have
fought
heretofore
and
now
i
have
come
to
play
chess
against
thee
for
well
thou
knowest
dear
to
the
perfect
warrior
after
war
is
know
it
answered
dhoya
when
we
have
played
dhoya
we
will
name
the
not
play
whispered
his
companion
at
his
side
but
dhoya
being
filled
with
his
at
the
sight
of
his
enemy
answered
will
play
and
i
know
well
the
stake
you
mean
and
i
name
this
for
mine
that
i
may
again
have
my
knee
on
your
chest
and
my
hands
on
your
throat
and
that
you
will
not
again
change
into
a
bundle
of
wet
his
companion
lay
down
on
a
skin
and
began
to
cry
a
little
dhoya
felt
sure
of
winning
he
had
often
played
in
his
boyhood
before
the
time
of
his
with
his
masters
of
the
galley
and
besides
he
could
always
return
to
his
hands
and
his
weapons
once
more
now
the
floor
of
the
cave
was
of
smooth
white
sand
brought
from
the
seashore
in
his
great
fomorian
pitcher
to
make
it
soft
for
his
beloved
to
walk
upon
before
it
had
been
as
it
now
is
of
rough
clay
on
this
sand
the
stranger
marked
out
with
his
a
and
marked
with
rushes
crossed
and
recrossed
each
alternate
square
fixing
each
end
of
the
rush
in
the
sand
until
a
complete
board
was
finished
of
white
and
green
squares
and
then
drew
from
a
bag
large
chessmen
of
mingled
wood
and
silver
two
or
three
would
have
made
an
armful
for
a
child
standing
each
at
his
end
they
began
to
play
the
game
did
not
last
long
no
matter
how
carefully
dhoya
played
each
move
went
against
him
at
last
leaping
back
from
the
board
he
cried
have
lost
the
two
spirits
were
standing
together
at
the
entrance
dhoya
seized
his
spear
but
slowly
the
figures
began
to
fade
first
a
star
and
then
the
leaves
showed
through
their
forms
soon
all
had
vanished
away
then
understanding
his
loss
he
threw
himself
on
the
ground
and
rolling
hither
and
thither
roared
like
a
wild
beast
all
night
long
he
lay
on
the
ground
and
all
the
next
day
till
nightfall
he
had
crumbled
his
staff
unconsciously
between
his
fingers
into
small
pieces
and
now
full
of
dull
rage
the
pointed
end
of
the
staff
still
in
his
hand
arose
and
went
forth
westward
in
a
ravine
of
the
northern
mountain
he
came
on
the
tracks
of
wild
horses
soon
one
passed
him
fearlessly
knowing
nothing
of
man
he
drove
the
pointed
end
of
the
staff
deep
in
the
flank
making
a
great
wound
sending
the
horse
rushing
with
short
screams
down
the
mountain
other
horses
passed
him
one
by
one
driven
southward
by
a
cold
wind
laden
with
mist
arisen
in
the
towards
the
end
of
the
ravine
stood
one
black
and
huge
the
leader
of
the
herd
dhoya
leaped
on
his
back
with
a
loud
cry
that
sent
a
raven
circling
from
the
neighbouring
cliff
and
the
horse
after
vainly
seeking
to
throw
him
rushed
off
towards
the
over
the
heights
of
the
mountains
where
the
mists
floated
the
moon
clear
sometimes
of
the
flying
clouds
from
low
down
in
the
cast
a
pale
and
mutable
light
making
their
shadow
rise
before
them
on
the
mists
as
though
they
pursued
some
colossal
demon
sombre
on
his
black
charger
then
leaving
the
heights
they
rushed
down
that
valley
where
in
far
later
times
diarmuid
hid
in
a
deep
cavern
his
grania
and
passed
the
stream
where
muadhan
their
savage
servant
caught
fish
for
them
on
a
hook
baited
with
a
on
over
the
plains
on
northward
mile
after
mile
the
wild
gigantic
horse
leaping
cliff
and
chasm
in
his
terrible
race
on
until
the
mountains
of
what
is
now
donegal
rose
before
them
over
these
among
the
clouds
driving
rain
blowing
in
their
faces
from
the
sea
dhoya
knowing
not
whither
he
went
or
why
he
rode
on
the
stones
loosened
by
the
hoofs
rumbling
down
into
the
valleys
till
far
in
the
distance
he
saw
the
sea
a
thousand
feet
below
him
then
fixing
his
eyes
thereon
and
using
the
as
a
goad
he
roused
his
black
horse
into
redoubled
speed
until
horse
and
rider
plunged
headlong
into
the
western
sea
sometimes
the
cotters
on
the
mountains
of
donegal
hear
on
windy
nights
a
sudden
sound
of
hoofs
and
say
to
each
other
goes
and
at
the
same
hour
men
say
if
any
be
abroad
in
the
valleys
they
see
a
huge
shadow
