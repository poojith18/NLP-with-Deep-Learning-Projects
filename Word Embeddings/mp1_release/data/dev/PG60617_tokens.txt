chapter
i
the
phenomenon
of
prohibition
the
strange
phenomenon
of
prohibition
after
an
appearance
amongst
us
of
over
three
years
is
still
to
the
majority
of
a
great
and
free
people
it
is
one
of
the
most
astonishing
manifestations
the
world
has
ever
witnessed
it
came
upon
us
like
a
phantom
swiftly
like
a
thief
in
the
night
taking
us
by
surprise
yet
the
prohibitionists
will
tell
you
that
no
one
should
be
amazed
since
for
years
for
almost
a
century
quiet
forces
have
been
at
work
to
bring
about
this
very
thing
most
of
us
can
remember
how
not
so
many
years
ago
when
we
wished
to
throw
away
our
vote
we
cast
it
for
the
prohibition
ticket
some
unknown
was
running
for
office
on
a
dry
platform
a
joke
we
said
give
him
the
weight
of
our
affirmation
to
enlarge
his
pitiful
handful
of
white
ballots
it
will
be
a
good
way
to
get
even
with
the
arrogant
and
into
the
box
we
laughingly
dropped
the
bit
of
paper
which
might
cause
a
mention
to
be
made
of
the
crank
in
the
next
news
columns
delightful
insincere
flattery
which
could
not
possibly
do
any
harm
how
well
how
thoroughly
how
consistently
we
gave
it
never
dreaming
that
the
solemn
hour
would
strike
when
our
gesture
would
no
longer
be
a
joke
the
morning
came
when
the
headlines
in
our
newspapers
proclaimed
the
fact
that
state
after
state
was
following
the
road
of
kansas
washington
maine
and
oregon
to
mention
only
a
few
states
which
for
some
time
had
elected
to
make
laws
that
were
almost
blue
local
option
yes
we
had
heard
of
it
in
the
effete
east
there
were
districts
we
knew
which
chose
the
path
of
virtue
and
they
were
welcome
to
their
sanctimoniousness
in
our
hearts
we
rather
approved
of
them
for
the
stand
which
they
had
taken
particularly
when
we
learned
on
an
occasional
visit
that
it
was
mighty
easy
to
give
a
with
plenty
of
liquid
refreshment
all
one
had
to
do
it
seemed
was
to
lift
the
telephone
receiver
in
bangor
and
ask
that
boston
send
over
a
supply
of
whatever
one
desired
there
were
no
restrictions
against
the
transportation
of
liquor
over
the
state
line
though
it
was
impossible
to
purchase
wines
and
spirits
in
the
holy
community
itself
our
national
insincerity
began
right
there
the
hiding
of
the
head
in
the
sands
that
is
what
it
amounted
to
and
we
all
smiled
and
laughed
and
went
on
having
a
perfectly
good
time
and
we
told
one
another
if
we
discussed
the
matter
at
all
that
of
course
the
worst
could
never
never
occur
what
rot
even
to
think
of
it
what
idiocy
to
take
seriously
a
state
of
affairs
so
nebulous
and
remote
it
was
like
predicting
a
world
war
which
eventually
came
about
it
was
like
dreaming
of
the
inconvenience
of
a
personal
income
tax
which
also
came
about
it
was
like
imagining
that
man
would
be
so
uncivilized
as
to
break
all
international
law
which
only
a
few
years
later
he
did
who
foresaw
the
use
of
poisonous
gas
in
the
most
frightful
conflict
of
history
who
had
vision
enough
to
tell
us
that
noncombatants
would
be
killed
as
they
were
in
belgium
though
treaties
had
been
signed
which
forbade
such
wanton
cruelty
who
could
foretell
the
bombing
of
cities
far
beyond
the
firing
line
yet
these
atrocities
occurred
with
singular
regularity
once
the
world
entered
upon
that
stupendous
struggle
which
began
in
august
we
came
to
take
such
happenings
for
granted
we
grew
accustomed
to
terror
as
one
grows
used
to
pain
and
all
that
we
had
built
and
dreamed
went
crashing
to
dust
and
ashes
prohibition
i
venture
to
say
was
the
last
thing
in
the
world
the
american
people
expected
to
have
come
upon
them
though
temperance
advocates
were
thick
through
the
country
the
brilliant
held
their
own
and
we
came
to
look
upon
them
as
an
essential
part
of
the
pageant
of
life
especially
in
cosmopolitan
cities
with
salvation
army
lassies
entering
them
to
pass
the
tambourine
men
in
their
cups
gave
generously
and
i
often
wonder
if
the
revenue
of
pious
organizations
has
not
seriously
diminished
now
that
there
are
no
haunts
of
vice
for
holy
workers
to
penetrate
surely
they
must
miss
this
casual
liberality
the
coin
or
the
bill
cast
with
a
grand
and
forgotten
gesture
into
the
extended
hand
but
do
not
imagine
i
am
holding
a
brief
for
the
corner
saloon
the
sins
of
an
enforced
prohibition
are
many
as
i
shall
seek
to
prove
but
the
passing
of
the
common
can
not
be
deprecated
no
sane
thinking
citizen
wishes
to
see
a
return
of
promiscuous
debauchery
a
glimpse
now
of
the
london
in
the
poorer
districts
of
the
english
capital
is
enough
to
convince
any
american
that
he
should
thank
his
stars
if
not
his
that
one
phase
of
our
social
consciousness
has
vanished
forever
if
we
could
have
sensibly
rid
ourselves
of
these
without
punishing
a
vast
multitude
of
us
who
knew
how
to
drink
wisely
much
good
would
have
been
accomplished
but
we
had
to
go
the
whole
gamut
we
had
to
make
ourselves
ridiculous
before
the
rest
of
the
world
in
order
to
bring
about
a
check
upon
the
gross
appetites
of
a
scattered
few
there
is
no
doubt
in
my
mind
that
there
will
be
a
reaction
the
pendulum
has
swung
too
far
as
any
observer
must
admit
the
present
conditions
throughout
the
country
are
so
disgraceful
that
something
must
be
done
to
remedy
them
our
personal
habits
became
a
matter
for
federal
investigation
our
daily
conduct
is
now
given
to
the
scrutiny
of
the
authorities
to
our
everlasting
discredit
we
are
a
nation
of
rejoicing
alike
in
our
secret
and
open
we
are
the
of
europe
we
are
the
jest
of
canada
and
mexico
our
neighbors
and
decent
americans
feel
that
a
stigma
has
been
put
upon
them
we
stammer
explanations
to
visiting
foreigners
who
confused
and
confounded
ask
us
what
it
all
means
we
are
confused
ourselves
at
the
muddle
our
government
is
making
of
the
whole
wretched
business
and
yet
being
americans
who
tolerate
all
kinds
of
injustices
we
meekly
submit
the
while
we
complain
and
are
too
lazy
most
of
us
to
lift
up
our
voices
to
utter
one
word
publicly
in
derision
of
this
monstrous
foolishness
what
is
to
happen
to
us
are
we
to
become
a
race
of
machines
supinely
submitting
to
autocratic
mandates
we
have
always
allowed
ruffians
to
rule
us
in
our
civic
politics
and
though
once
in
a
while
we
bitterly
cry
out
the
ruffians
knowing
our
weaknesses
only
too
well
pay
no
attention
we
are
like
the
worm
that
turns
but
who
cares
since
no
change
is
evident
when
the
worm
shows
its
other
side
one
of
the
great
troubles
with
america
is
that
only
in
rare
instances
will
the
finer
type
of
young
manhood
enter
politics
we
leave
the
high
business
of
running
the
government
to
men
of
inferior
caliber
whereas
in
a
land
like
england
a
political
career
is
a
distinction
as
much
to
be
chosen
and
sought
as
the
church
until
we
come
to
a
realization
of
the
peril
that
confronts
us
through
our
spirit
of
we
shall
deserve
as
plato
says
exactly
the
kind
of
government
we
get
with
all
our
recognized
national
gusto
and
verve
there
can
be
no
denial
of
the
tragic
fact
that
we
are
mentally
indolent
when
a
political
cause
is
in
the
balance
i
have
known
men
of
worth
in
the
professions
and
in
the
world
of
business
to
neglect
the
polls
on
election
day
in
order
to
indulge
in
a
game
of
golf
yet
these
are
the
first
to
cry
out
when
the
politicians
triumph
we
permit
our
to
be
filled
by
incompetent
grocers
and
butchers
clerks
with
little
imagination
failures
and
cab
drivers
and
chauffeurs
who
are
morons
even
the
women
who
were
so
anxious
for
equal
suffrage
find
in
many
cases
that
civic
duties
are
a
burden
and
avoid
their
obvious
responsibilities
we
let
george
do
everything
which
we
find
in
the
least
unpleasant
well
there
is
a
price
for
such
lethargy
it
is
terrifying
to
read
over
the
names
of
the
judges
and
magistrates
on
the
american
bench
and
see
how
many
are
of
foreign
origin
listen
to
the
in
any
the
poppelfingers
and
morinos
and
sauerkrautzers
predominate
where
are
our
first
american
families
it
might
be
well
to
ask
indeed
where
they
will
be
in
another
generation
or
two
you
and
i
walk
along
the
streets
and
see
a
man
suddenly
stricken
a
crowd
quickly
gathers
about
his
pitiful
form
stares
into
his
countenance
a
policeman
calls
an
ambulance
a
gong
rings
and
he
is
carried
off
to
a
hospital
you
and
i
go
our
way
with
perhaps
a
momentary
tug
at
our
heart
but
it
never
occurs
to
us
that
the
man
in
the
street
might
have
been
ourselves
such
things
happen
to
others
no
they
could
never
never
happen
to
us
the
lightning
may
strike
a
house
or
barn
but
not
our
own
death
or
disaster
may
come
to
the
other
fellow
never
to
us
never
can
might
be
our
national
slogan
thus
has
a
stupid
pollyanna
optimism
penetrated
our
civic
thought
our
political
consciousness
our
spiritual
being
and
the
false
doctrine
is
screamed
from
every
housetop
from
manhattan
to
gopher
prairie
pretty
little
poems
printed
in
neat
frames
greet
us
wherever
we
turn
they
urge
us
to
cheer
up
that
it
is
not
raining
rain
but
only
flowers
and
that
in
his
heaven
and
right
with
the
world
forgetting
that
browning
when
he
penned
his
immortal
line
referred
to
a
particular
morning
for
a
particular
man
of
vision
and
by
no
means
intended
to
be
quoted
out
of
his
context
as
a
basis
for
the
silly
of
hoards
of
people
who
think
they
think
our
are
crammed
with
comedians
who
sing
in
loud
voices
something
about
the
use
of
worrying
it
never
was
worth
while
and
bidding
us
smile
smile
smile
and
we
clap
and
giggle
and
stamp
our
feet
and
go
out
into
the
night
and
are
shoved
and
pushed
into
an
subway
train
and
still
fondly
cherish
the
delusion
that
we
should
keep
on
smiling
though
a
brutal
boot
is
jammed
into
our
reluctant
back
so
that
we
may
become
one
more
sardine
in
the
steel
box
he
is
so
expert
in
packing
it
would
all
be
very
amusing
were
it
not
so
serious
sinclair
lewis
who
is
becoming
the
best
photographer
this
country
ever
produced
has
not
given
us
a
false
picture
of
our
towns
and
cities
he
tells
the
brutal
truth
bravely
but
we
read
him
smile
and
say
that
of
course
all
very
well
and
such
localities
may
exist
but
they
are
not
those
in
which
we
dwell
and
all
the
while
about
us
are
the
very
folk
his
deft
pen
has
drawn
what
a
stupid
old
fool
he
is
and
we
may
have
seen
him
in
but
we
never
will
admit
that
he
is
our
neighbor
the
day
may
come
when
we
will
have
to
admit
that
he
is
our
very
self
we
have
the
superiority
complex
which
of
course
is
nothing
but
a
confession
that
we
are
inferior
and
in
allowing
restriction
after
restriction
to
be
put
upon
us
how
in
the
name
of
common
sense
and
in
the
words
of
the
man
in
the
street
do
we
get
that
way
we
are
the
most
governed
people
in
the
world
today
there
are
plenty
of
laws
but
little
order
and
the
millennium
that
the
prohibitionists
promised
with
the
adoption
of
the
eighteenth
amendment
is
farther
away
than
ever
let
us
wake
up
and
face
conditions
as
they
are
let
us
not
try
to
delude
ourselves
into
a
state
of
false
happiness
when
at
heart
we
are
the
most
unhappy
nation
now
breathing
the
celebrated
air
it
is
high
time
we
did
some
solemn
thinking
the
writing
is
on
the
wall
it
is
our
business
to
read
the
words
inscribed
there
in
letters
of
fire
chapter
ii
our
great
unhappiness
are
the
american
people
any
worse
than
other
people
that
they
should
be
put
upon
the
who
is
it
that
sits
in
judgment
over
them
what
unseen
kaiser
czar
autocrat
passes
sentence
upon
their
morals
we
fought
a
war
to
get
rid
of
such
leaders
and
rulers
and
now
ironically
enough
we
find
ourselves
under
the
domination
of
far
stronger
i
have
recently
been
traveling
through
a
great
portion
of
this
great
country
everywhere
i
found
a
curious
unhappiness
people
may
not
be
articulate
about
their
sorrows
just
as
the
poor
may
not
speak
of
their
poverty
yet
the
canker
is
there
the
worm
the
bud
is
eating
away
the
heart
of
the
flower
perhaps
i
should
use
the
word
discontent
rather
than
unhappiness
or
restlessness
or
resentment
at
any
rate
the
feeling
whatever
it
is
exists
and
there
is
a
new
menace
over
our
days
the
placid
reformers
resting
between
reforms
smack
their
lips
in
sadistic
glee
in
the
face
of
repeated
and
open
violations
of
the
law
they
give
out
interviews
to
the
effect
that
all
is
moving
serenely
that
the
people
are
under
beautiful
control
though
they
have
to
admit
that
they
squirm
once
in
a
while
here
again
it
is
a
case
of
stupid
optimism
they
all
to
be
well
and
they
fondly
imagine
that
all
well
they
will
have
a
great
awakening
for
this
smoldering
discontent
and
anger
is
bound
to
rise
in
a
great
tide
one
of
these
days
illustration

the
trial
the
package
in

was

on

fine
fury
of
eloquence
the
majesty
of
the
law
must
be
upheld
listen
to
a
lady
reformer
in
chicago
speaking
after
a
church
league
meeting
in
september
evidently
she
is
out
of
touch
with
the
world
secure
in
the
sanctity
of
a
liquorless
home
she
has
never
attended
a
real
poor
dear
and
somehow
my
heart
goes
out
to
her
law
is
being
enforced
and
the
results
are
more
than
satisfactory
the
brewers
are
skulking
opponents
what
are
they
doing
now
she
inquired
blandly
of
her
audience
are
making
candies
some
soft
drinks
some
other
things
but
they
are
all
making
money
and
are
happy
prohibition
is
a
wonderful
thing
and
i
am
proud
to
be
a
citizen
of
the
country
that
has
adopted
how
sweet
and
cheerful
but
as
she
spoke
i
wonder
if
she
knew
that
almost
around
the
corner
real
beer
and
whiskey
were
easily
procurable
that
as
she
uttered
her
oracular
words
men
with
passed
the
door
behind
which
she
was
speaking
on
their
way
to
joyful
occasions
the
law
was
never
less
effectively
enforced
dear
lady
you
are
living
in
a
world
of
dreams
and
fancies
you
should
get
about
more
and
meet
the
flappers
and
who
could
tell
you
and
show
you
a
thing
or
two
your
rhapsodies
are
all
very
well
but
your
smug
delight
in
conditions
has
a
note
of
pathos
to
one
who
has
observed
the
country
as
it
is
and
not
as
you
would
have
it
alas
you
are
but
deluding
yourself
and
my
heart
goes
out
to
you
in
your
simplicity
is
the
law
being
upheld
when
at
a
at
a
certain
country
club
two
policemen
in
uniform
were
sent
by
the
local
authorities
to
the
while
much
liquor
was
poured
these
minions
of
the
sacred
law
were
openly
served
with
highballs
and
they
laughed
at
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
i
saw
them
and
heard
them
myself
they
came
to
get
drunk
and
certainly
succeeded
everyone
at
that
party
deplored
the
behavior
was
loud
in
denunciation
of
prohibition
and
what
has
come
in
its
wake
yet
went
on
eating
and
drinking
and
dancing
with
the
casual
remark
that
it
was
of
no
consequence
whether
or
not
they
broke
the
law
since
everyone
was
doing
it
is
there
any
veneration
for
the
law
of
the
land
when
advocates
of
the
eighteenth
amendment
men
who
sponsored
it
publicly
in
private
deride
it
and
at
the
mention
of
volstead
sneer
and
jeer
and
purchase
cocktails
in
new
york
restaurants
at
a
dollar
apiece
gulping
them
down
openly
i
asked
such
an
advocate
a
politician
who
would
like
to
be
called
a
statesman
why
it
was
that
if
he
believed
in
the
volstead
act
he
continued
to
consume
his
daily
quota
of
scotch
i
believe
anybody
had
ever
ventured
to
put
such
a
frank
question
to
him
his
wife
on
my
left
blanched
she
by
the
way
never
touches
a
drop
but
her
exalted
husband
is
fond
of
the
cup
that
cheers
and
inebriates
he
has
held
high
office
and
has
been
loud
in
his
advocacy
of
prohibition
for
the
other
fellow
he
glared
at
me
when
i
rashly
put
my
question
to
him
lifted
his
glass
high
and
cried
out
intending
to
be
witty
i
thought
him
merely
disgraceful
and
drunk
as
usual
drink
as
much
and
as
often
as
i
can
in
order
to
lessen
the
supply
and
then
he
had
the
effrontery
to
add
course
i
mean
to
see
to
it
that
the
law
is
upheld
when
liquor
cases
come
up
before
yet
i
had
read
a
statement
of
his
in
the
newspapers
when
he
was
running
for
office
declaring
that
wine
was
a
mocker
and
that
whosoever
was
deceived
thereby
was
not
wise
oh
yes
he
could
quote
scripture
with
a
vengeance
this
minion
of
the
law
my
lady
friend
in
chicago
seeing
him
on
the
street
would
count
him
as
among
the
holy
band
who
have
put
their
upon
volstead
anderson
et
al
yet
behind
closed
doors
he
is
a
hyde
who
takes
a
fiendish
pleasure
in
his
dual
nature
i
like
him
not
the
lady
in
chicago
is
at
least
consistent
were
i
a
worker
or
an
member
or
even
a
judge
who
tried
bootleggers
i
think
i
should
strive
for
a
similar
state
of
holiness
and
always
be
willing
to
let
my
left
hand
know
what
my
right
hand
was
doing
the
truth
is
that
laws
of
intolerance
defeat
their
own
ends
the
instant
you
tell
people
not
to
do
something
they
have
an
irresistible
desire
to
do
it
there
can
not
be
laws
greater
than
the
people
themselves
and
that
law
is
the
most
insidious
and
dangerous
of
all
which
discriminates
between
the
rich
and
poor
i
am
by
temperament
and
training
a
conservative
yet
i
confess
that
were
i
a
workingman
deprived
of
my
beer
i
would
find
it
hard
to
remain
calm
when
returning
from
my
labor
i
was
forced
to
go
to
an
arid
tenement
passing
the
homes
of
those
who
possessed
cellars
and
who
replenished
them
at
will
those
who
labor
ceaselessly
for
the
cause
of
prohibition
will
tell
you
that
it
will
not
always
be
possible
to
obtain
liquor
that
the
rich
too
will
come
to
a
state
of
drouth
and
i
have
even
heard
some
of
them
say
that
after
all
there
are
many
things
the
rich
have
always
had
which
the
poor
could
not
possess
and
drink
is
but
another
symbol
for
such
light
arguments
i
have
no
use
i
could
only
say
to
so
profound
a
student
of
human
nature
and
the
humanities
that
he
along
with
his
kind
is
sowing
the
wind
and
will
reap
the
whirlwind
with
money
we
seem
to
be
able
to
purchase
anything
we
desire
in
this
land
of
lost
liberty
one
of
them
is
a
volstead
did
not
quite
dare
to
make
it
illegal
to
drink
in
home
there
might
have
been
a
serious
exodus
from
the
country
had
such
a
drastic
law
been
passed
or
even
seriously
considered
since
magna
charta
a
house
has
been
his
castle
and
an
invasion
of
the
sacred
precincts
would
cause
unlimited
chaos
yet
in
certain
of
our
states
john
doe
may
now
be
obtained
and
officials
may
enter
to
ascertain
if
drinking
is
going
on
it
is
unthinkable
but
it
is
so
but
then
there
are
many
foolish
legislative
blunders
made
from
year
to
year
and
a
placid
and
people
pay
little
attention
to
them
i
have
heard
men
complain
of
the
laws
in
their
community
who
would
not
lift
a
finger
to
see
that
they
were
changed
in
the
far
west
recently
learning
of
a
certain
intolerable
mandate
i
could
not
resist
asking
a
lawyer
why
his
state
stood
for
it
his
only
reply
was
that
they
gave
it
little
thought
until
someone
from
outside
like
myself
came
along
and
drew
its
horrors
to
their
attention
then
with
the
going
of
the
stranger
from
their
midst
they
settled
down
once
more
to
calm
acquiescence
or
else
they
openly
disobeyed
the
law
and
when
they
thought
of
the
possible
consequences
roared
with
laughter
for
no
one
had
ever
been
put
in
prison
for
a
violation
of
the
statute
and
of
course
no
one
ever
would
be
then
why
have
it
on
the
books
oh
well
what
difference
did
it
make
the
women
wanted
it
there
but
of
course
they
mean
it
and
it
was
a
joke
anyhow
and
it
worth
worrying
over
when
you
came
to
think
of
it
and
maybe
the
legislative
body
had
to
earn
its
salary
and
how
about
a
little
game
of
golf
to
forget
it
i
suppose
we
have
come
to
be
such
a
nation
that
we
are
losing
sight
of
all
the
old
ideals
our
forefathers
fought
for
the
passage
of
the
eighteenth
amendment
may
have
been
the
best
thing
that
could
have
happened
to
us
since
it
has
in
a
sense
aroused
us
to
the
point
of
anger
whereas
piffling
restrictions
put
upon
our
liberty
have
left
us
cold
and
indifferent
but
here
at
last
is
something
big
enough
to
cause
most
of
us
inconvenience
and
the
american
people
do
dislike
to
be
inconvenienced
we
could
get
together
on
this
burning
subject
where
we
would
fail
to
dovetail
on
lesser
questions
our
heterogeneous
citizenry
is
inflamed
as
one
man
for
the
wants
his
beer
the
his
red
wine
the
his
grog
the
his
ale
and
port
the
his
vodka
the
his
punch
the
his
champagne
and
light
wine
and
so
on
down
the
line
and
through
the
maze
of
races
that
go
to
form
our
vast
republic
is
it
too
late
to
get
together
here
again
we
may
fail
to
act
in
concert
for
the
foreigner
within
our
gates
feeling
the
contagion
of
our
national
slothfulness
in
a
cause
and
waiting
to
get
his
cue
from
us
sits
back
and
wonders
why
we
do
not
act
and
many
an
american
waits
and
wonders
too
chapter
iii
our
endless
chain
of
laws
when
we
sit
back
and
rail
at
the
eighteenth
amendment
and
the
volstead
act
we
lose
sight
of
other
laws
equally
tyrannous
which
however
do
not
happen
to
affect
us
is
it
generally
known
for
instance
that
in
the
state
of
utah
there
is
a
statute
which
makes
it
a
misdemeanor
to
purchase
sell
or
smoke
cigarettes
one
may
not
puff
in
a
public
place
yet
one
may
do
so
in
private
the
law
contends
the
mormon
church
is
opposed
not
only
to
drinking
and
smoking
but
to
as
well
and
as
the
elders
in
that
church
are
the
big
property
owners
in
salt
lake
city
controlling
the
hotels
and
other
public
buildings
when
i
went
there
not
long
ago
i
wondered
if
i
would
be
permitted
to
light
a
weed
with
gracing
the
lobbies
of
the
smartest
caravanseries
i
had
my
doubts
but
when
i
casually
asked
where
the
was
i
was
directed
to
a
garish
counter
and
beneath
gleaming
glass
cases
i
saw
to
my
amazement
all
brands
of
cigarettes
on
sale
i
asked
how
this
could
be
take
this
law
seriously
a
native
said
to
me
am
getting
so
that
i
can
not
take
any
law
seriously
was
my
natural
answer
as
it
undoubtedly
would
have
been
yours
dear
reader
yet
you
and
i
call
ourselves
perfectly
decent
american
citizens
do
we
not
i
the
slightest
trouble
in
purchasing
everything
that
i
wanted
yet
a
new
fear
possessed
me
after
dinner
would
it
be
possible
to
smoke
in
the
main
to
make
a
long
story
short
it
was
everyone
was
doing
it
just
as
though
a
law
had
never
been
heard
of
and
i
saw
mormons
consuming
coffee
too
think
of
it
for
almost
two
years
now
the
farce
has
gone
on
no
one
thinks
it
curious
any
more
that
the
mandate
is
not
obeyed
they
told
me
of
a
case
recently
tried
out
there
a
small
tobacco
merchant
an
italian
if
i
recall
correctly
was
arrested
for
selling
a
package
of
cigarettes
to
a
detective
to
remind
people
of
the
august
legislature
and
to
give
the
another
reason
for
being
taxed
a
minion
of
the
law
must
go
about
now
and
then
on
a
fat
salary
to
investigate
conditions
at
the
trial
the
package
in
evidence
was
placed
on
a
large
table
in
the
presence
of
the
jury
and
the
court
it
was
all
very
incriminating
the
prosecuting
attorney
worked
himself
into
a
fine
fury
of
eloquence
denouncing
the
pitiful
little
culprit
in
language
that
the
wretch
on
trial
could
not
possibly
understand
the
majesty
of
the
law
must
be
upheld
this
was
terrible
it
was
atrocious
though
nothing
was
said
of
the
fact
that
down
in
the
heart
of
the
city
every
hour
of
the
day
this
same
law
was
openly
violated
the
judge
solemnly
charged
the
jury
and
hastened
out
to
luncheon
but
the
twelve
good
men
and
true
were
out
only
a
few
moments
they
brought
in
a
verdict
of
not
guilty
can
this
be
cried
the
court
in
wrath
and
the
counsel
for
the
people
tore
his
hair
metaphorically
if
not
literally
the
detective
looked
blank
then
the
foreman
arose
and
said
that
the
jury
had
had
no
evidence
presented
to
them
that
cigarettes
had
been
sold
as
the
package
covering
the
alleged
malignant
little
weeds
had
never
been
opened
and
so
the
money
of
the
good
citizens
of
utah
is
being
spent
on
such
trials
and
they
continue
to
stand
for
it
a
delightful
state
of
affairs
my
masters
such
incidents
should
get
into
the
papers
more
frequently
for
we
can
all
stand
anything
but
ridicule
and
when
the
law
is
thus
made
ridiculous
it
is
to
laugh
it
or
should
one
remain
serious
in
the
face
of
such
nonsense
as
of
course
the
reformers
would
have
us
do
well
i
am
afraid
they
will
have
to
pass
laws
against
smiling
before
i
can
be
brought
to
terms
and
even
then
i
may
break
another
law
and
go
to
jail
for
it
or
more
likely
remain
peacefully
at
home
as
i
do
now
breaking
so
many
that
i
have
stopped
counting
them
i
fear
that
i
break
the
speed
laws
as
do
you
i
am
afraid
that
most
of
us
do
yet
i
am
not
conscious
of
good
ladies
of
any
national
speed
law
society
giving
up
that
they
may
get
out
on
the
highways
to
watch
us
and
report
us
and
if
need
be
arrest
us
themselves
yet
when
you
and
i
dine
at
a
restaurant
in
a
city
like
new
york
we
are
apt
to
note
a
policeman
in
uniform
standing
in
the
doorway
his
eagle
eye
upon
us
to
see
that
we
do
not
take
flasks
from
our
pockets
i
wonder
what
would
happen
if
under
the
very
nose
of
this
representative
of
law
and
order
one
should
pour
from
a
bottle
some
harmless
alas
i
fear
that
the
law
is
not
to
be
trifled
with
in
that
way
the
dignity
of
our
jurisprudence
must
not
be
disturbed
one
might
be
hauled
up
and
arraigned
for
disorderly
conduct
or
for
some
such
charge
but
it
a
pretty
picture
it
to
see
perfectly
good
watched
and
spied
upon
while
they
eat
their
meals
ye
gods
and
in
a
supposedly
free
country
how
our
ancestors
must
turn
in
their
graves
they
who
wrote
something
they
about
liberty
and
the
pursuit
of
who
shall
define
that
last
phrase
today
i
wonder
what
it
means
what
anything
means
in
these
times
not
long
ago
in
solemn
conclave
in
an
eastern
city
a
holy
body
of
men
and
women
aroused
the
whole
country
to
its
first
volume
of
fury
by
suggesting
that
be
used
to
enforce
obedience
to
the
prohibition
law
in
their
fanatical
zeal
they
were
seriously
for
murdering
a
number
of
us
and
they
saw
no
humor
in
their
announcement
what
were
a
few
lives
if
the
law
was
upheld
a
law
by
the
way
which
millions
of
thinking
people
do
not
believe
should
ever
have
been
put
upon
our
statutes
no
more
shameful
resolution
was
ever
made
at
a
public
meeting
yet
i
would
not
have
been
surprised
had
it
been
passed
to
such
a
state
of
imbecility
have
we
come
why
stop
where
we
are
let
the
digging
in
go
on
let
the
teeth
of
the
law
sink
into
your
flesh
until
we
groan
in
agony
let
the
busybodies
and
the
cranks
become
as
thick
as
flies
and
locusts
in
time
of
pestilence
let
them
gather
in
battalions
around
us
sting
us
flay
us
torture
us
until
at
last
the
vestige
of
manhood
which
is
left
in
us
may
cause
us
to
turn
upon
them
i
fear
that
the
law
which
makes
it
illegal
for
a
minor
to
be
admitted
to
a
theater
or
a
palace
is
broken
every
day
in
every
city
of
our
broad
and
beneficent
land
yet
i
do
not
find
pickets
from
societies
standing
about
to
see
that
the
letter
of
the
law
is
obeyed
we
pretend
to
be
deeply
interested
in
the
welfare
of
the
coming
generation
so
interested
in
fact
that
the
present
generation
is
forced
to
give
up
its
harmless
toddy
that
the
children
of
tomorrow
may
be
robust
supermen
and
superwomen
the
fact
is
that
to
the
fanatic
no
law
is
sacred
except
the
eighteenth
amendment
the
fifteenth
oh
why
talk
of
it
the
south
knows
its
problems
and
can
cope
with
them
besides
well
ahem
another
matter
and
has
no
bearing
upon
the
issue
at
hand
why
it
yet
if
you
ask
ten
people
in
the
street
what
the
fifteenth
amendment
is
the
chances
are
that
only
one
will
be
able
to
tell
you
if
the
negro
was
enfranchised
he
was
enfranchised
and
should
be
permitted
to
vote
that
is
the
law
of
the
land
it
is
part
of
our
glorious
constitution
but
do
you
hear
anyone
raising
a
row
over
the
fact
that
no
one
pays
any
attention
to
it
in
certain
parts
of
the
south
few
zealots
work
for
the
rights
of
negro
voters
none
i
should
say
it
matters
little
to
us
that
they
are
denied
that
privilege
which
belongs
to
every
citizen
here
whether
he
is
black
or
white
or
what
his
previous
condition
of
servitude
why
should
we
respect
one
amendment
to
the
constitution
and
be
allowed
to
hold
in
contempt
another
truly
the
logic
of
the
fanatic
is
hard
to
follow
if
one
of
them
reads
these
words
he
will
merely
smile
and
pass
on
and
do
nothing
at
all
about
it
for
just
now
he
is
fearfully
concerned
over
volstead
and
the
carrying
out
of
his
policies
one
thing
at
a
time
please
his
interest
may
keep
him
busy
for
so
many
years
to
come
that
he
will
have
the
excuse
of
no
free
moment
to
study
the
fifteenth
amendment
but
all
the
amendments
should
be
enforced
or
wiped
off
the
books
riding
in
a
train
once
through
the
sanctified
state
of
kansas
where
long
they
have
refused
to
let
you
and
me
buy
a
cigarette
i
asked
for
a
package
in
the
let
you
have
was
the
answer
of
the
steward
on
kansas
why
you
inform
passengers
before
we
cross
the
state
line
in
order
that
they
may
stock
up
i
inquired
humanly
enough
i
thought
should
look
out
for
themselves
was
his
rather
unkind
reply
i
thought
a
moment
i
did
want
a
smoke
and
i
was
determined
to
have
one
despite
all
the
laws
in
christendom
i
told
my
feelings
to
the
steward
he
saw
that
i
was
in
earnest
in
fact
he
came
to
see
the
justice
of
my
suggestion
that
passengers
unaccustomed
at
that
time
to
so
many
restrictions
this
happened
in
the
halcyon
prehistoric
days
before
prohibition
should
be
given
some
hint
of
the
approach
of
the
state
line
he
came
over
and
whispered
in
my
ear
first
looking
about
him
as
we
are
all
doing
nowadays
the
while
we
laugh
at
russia
and
prussia
if
drop
a
quarter
on
the
floor
pick
it
up
and
be
a
package
of
cigarettes
under
your
napkin
in
a
thus
was
another
holy
law
disobeyed
and
it
is
done
every
day
o
proud
fanatics
who
think
you
are
cleaning
us
up
and
it
always
will
be
done
for
poor
old
frail
human
nature
is
just
what
it
is
and
spiritual
reformation
can
never
come
as
you
would
have
it
from
without
in
we
must
all
work
out
our
own
destinies
from
within
out
somehow
we
like
the
little
battles
with
our
souls
they
add
a
piquancy
to
life
they
give
a
spice
and
zest
to
the
level
days
our
appetites
are
our
own
affairs
the
moderate
drinker
is
not
a
drunkard
and
to
place
restrictions
upon
him
in
order
to
cure
the
is
as
unjust
as
it
would
be
to
put
the
petit
larceny
prisoner
in
the
death
chair
along
with
the
murderer
gertrude
atherton
who
is
wise
and
once
wrote
an
article
against
prohibition
which
began
with
these
sharp
incisive
sentences
am
a
woman
i
never
drink
but
i
am
against
my
own
sentiments
exactly
temperance
yes
but
never
absolute
restrictions
and
if
we
continue
to
place
them
upon
the
people
we
shall
have
nothing
but
broken
shattered
laws
all
down
the
line
and
finally
something
else
will
be
broken
and
shattered
i
mean
the
dream
of
this
great
republic
i
mean
the
illusion
which
all
of
us
had
that
we
were
not
to
live
under
despots
i
mean
the
hope
of
a
race
which
believed
in
democracy
and
finds
itself
suddenly
in
the
grasp
and
under
the
domination
of
bitter
tyrants
who
seek
to
chain
us
and
imprison
not
only
our
bodies
but
our
very
souls
chapter
iv
too
much
one
hears
a
great
deal
about
the
way
the
volstead
act
and
the
eighteenth
amendment
were
on
the
american
people
it
is
true
as
i
have
said
that
the
legislation
came
upon
us
suddenly
but
everything
was
done
in
a
perfectly
legal
and
orderly
manner
the
people
did
not
realize
how
far
the
league
and
kindred
organizations
had
gone
in
their
work
also
deny
it
as
they
will
the
advocates
of
prohibition
used
the
war
as
an
excuse
as
a
cloak
for
their
propaganda
it
was
perfectly
right
for
the
secretary
of
war
and
the
secretary
of
the
navy
to
forbid
the
sale
of
liquor
to
our
men
in
uniform
after
we
got
into
the
conflict
we
were
at
war
and
it
would
have
been
as
foolish
for
our
boys
to
get
drunk
as
it
would
be
for
an
actor
to
go
on
the
stage
intoxicated
moreover
in
the
heroic
glamour
of
those
now
happily
vanished
days
it
was
so
easy
for
soldiers
and
sailors
to
be
by
any
and
everyone
better
then
to
clamp
the
lid
on
tightly
it
was
a
time
for
efficiency
and
no
one
is
so
foolish
as
to
contend
that
the
consumption
of
whiskey
in
large
doses
makes
for
a
hardier
race
one
believes
with
paul
in
in
all
youth
in
a
period
of
stress
needs
direction
just
as
children
do
having
arrived
at
an
age
of
reason
man
should
be
permitted
to
go
his
own
way
but
just
as
we
needed
discipline
in
the
ranks
physical
discipline
we
needed
spiritual
discipline
in
wartime
there
can
be
no
real
argument
about
this
i
think
but
even
here
we
failed
partly
liquor
sold
to
men
in
uniform
and
men
in
uniform
wanted
it
and
found
many
ways
to
obtain
it
the
forbidden
apple
is
always
the
sweetest
and
the
more
we
restrict
and
preach
and
restrain
the
more
eager
certain
natures
will
always
be
to
achieve
the
very
thing
we
decry
and
withhold
the
war
of
course
was
responsible
for
many
upheavals
we
could
not
enter
such
a
fiery
conflict
without
feeling
its
bitter
after
effects
any
more
than
one
can
drink
immoderately
and
not
feel
ill
the
next
morning
that
we
fought
to
make
a
weary
world
safe
for
democracy
is
now
nothing
but
a
joke
a
gilbert
and
sullivan
joke
worthy
of
a
deathless
lyric
indeed
a
short
time
ago
had
a
librettist
put
into
a
comic
opera
some
of
the
happenings
between
and
only
some
of
them
mind
you
his
book
would
have
been
hissed
off
the
stage
there
are
some
things
that
are
true
to
life
but
not
true
to
fiction
for
instance
think
of
the
irony
of
our
boys
being
sent
across
the
seas
to
shoot
guns
at
the
prussians
and
begging
them
to
free
themselves
from
an
autocratic
kaiser
and
during
their
necessary
absence
being
deprived
of
a
glass
of
beer
when
they
came
back
home
it
would
be
the
most
laughable
farce
comedy
were
it
not
the
deepest
tragedy
i
can
conceive
of
a
brilliant
first
act
wherein
some
doughboys
parched
and
thirsty
arrive
in
a
german
village
and
for
the
first
time
in
their
lives
taste
real
münchner
beer
the
beer
of
their
enemy
learn
to
like
it
decently
enough
get
the
recipe
and
decide
to
take
back
to
their
home
town
the
one
good
and
harmless
thing
the
enemy
country
gave
them
then
as
a
climax
they
arrive
wounded
and
depressed
a
tatterdemalion
battalion
glad
that
the
filthy
war
is
over
and
done
and
ready
now
to
drop
back
into
calm
blissful
citizenship
with
their
young
wives
and
families
but
no
say
a
delegation
of
legislators
on
the
pier
a
charming
comic
chorus
this
with
palms
extended
upright
are
all
wrong
bo
and
you
really
ought
to
know
that
rearranged
the
show
and
you
will
go
and
though
honors
we
bestow
now
alas
no
beer
will
flow
for
put
one
over
on
you
curtain
amid
general
consternation
now
if
a
libretto
with
this
plot
development
had
been
offered
to
a
broadway
manager
six
years
ago
it
would
have
been
turned
down
at
once
as
impossible
i
can
see
the
first
report
great
deal
of
whimsical
imagination
is
shown
by
the
author
but
the
american
people
are
very
sensible
and
even
barrie
and
gilbert
could
not
be
allowed
to
take
such
liberties
with
life
as
it
is
it
too
bad
that
writers
do
not
know
the
public
better
what
a
pity
it
is
that
they
can
not
evolve
plots
that
will
be
a
revelation
of
life
as
it
is
not
as
it
might
be
in
a
mad
whirligig
world
of
fancy
this
is
not
good
even
as
satire
for
the
situation
could
not
exist
even
in
a
realm
of
but
see
what
has
happened
this
plot
would
have
proved
a
prophecy
and
made
several
fortunes
for
the
author
and
the
manager
i
hear
some
character
saying
in
the
course
of
the
first
act
just
before
the
curtain
descends
you
mean
to
say
that
the
boys
who
fought
for
this
democracy
stuff
had
no
voice
in
the
passing
of
the
law
that
made
it
a
crime
to
sip
a
glass
of
good
beer
and
the
answer
would
be
course
not
how
behind
the
times
you
are
america
is
a
free
country
you
know
the
people
who
dwell
in
it
boast
of
their
superiority
of
intellect
and
rejoice
in
their
form
of
though
they
abrogate
their
votes
to
a
pack
of
politicians
who
are
well
to
put
it
bluntly
dishonest
for
they
drink
themselves
while
they
bow
to
lobbyists
who
believe
in
drink
for
the
other
fellow
america
my
good
sir
is
the
land
of
the
spree
no
longer
it
is
the
home
of
the
business
of
laughter
solemn
music
is
heard
and
the
entire
chorus
of
legislators
pass
with
stately
steps
to
the
capitol
dressed
in
heavy
mourning
but
nothing
is
being
done
about
anything
the
american
people
whipped
into
obedience
as
prussians
were
never
whipped
take
their
medicine
from
which
all
but
of
one
per
cent
of
alcohol
has
been
extracted
and
why
this
modicum
should
be
permitted
to
remain
is
only
another
joker
in
the
whole
stupid
business
and
obey
the
law
only
they
they
go
out
and
break
it
to
bits
as
i
have
shown
and
our
legislators
wonder
why
they
have
so
many
bad
children
on
their
hands
and
it
a
strange
world
and
why
is
it
that
folks
be
good
and
do
as
they
are
told
and
what
are
laws
for
anyhow
and
this
disrespect
of
the
law
is
awful
and
must
be
punished
and
someone
has
got
to
go
to
jail
and
why
is
bolshevism
growing
when
we
are
all
so
happy
ah
there
is
the
answer
in
one
word
we
are
not
happy
every
one
is
decidedly
unequivocally
wretchedly
miserably
gloomily
stonily
fearfully
terribly
unhappy
and
why
because
one
has
to
fight
so
hard
for
his
fun
nowadays
a
lot
of
laws
have
been
passed
and
more
are
threatened
which
blast
hopes
of
the
simplest
kind
of
good
times
these
laws
are
based
on
a
complete
misunderstanding
of
poor
old
human
nature
which
needs
every
now
and
then
say
what
you
will
an
escape
from
the
dreariness
the
tedium
of
life
the
harmless
diversions
which
in
childhood
take
the
form
of
playing
ball
and
cricket
and
tennis
experience
a
metamorphosis
as
we
grow
older
a
perfectly
natural
metamorphosis
and
we
crave
just
a
tinge
of
excitement
after
the
harsh
unyielding
work
most
americans
work
hard
there
is
no
doubt
of
that
except
for
a
cause
but
seriously
american
business
is
a
strenuous
glorious
thing
a
delightful
game
if
you
will
but
it
is
also
a
serious
note
in
the
scale
of
our
national
consciousness
we
need
relaxation
after
eight
or
nine
hours
at
a
desk
and
the
lights
of
a
great
city
are
the
lure
that
lead
us
forth
not
to
get
drunk
god
knows
but
to
get
just
that
fillip
the
weary
body
and
brain
need
when
an
honest
work
is
done
the
people
who
understand
this
and
who
are
trying
to
rule
and
run
america
are
in
a
class
with
those
who
fail
to
understand
the
psychology
of
coney
island
or
any
other
simple
pleasure
resort
who
are
unable
to
distinguish
between
a
happy
sobriety
and
filthy
gutter
intoxication
who
never
heard
line
about
shelley
give
me
the
young
man
with
brains
enough
to
make
a
fool
of
how
a
glass
of
light
wine
or
beer
is
going
to
hurt
a
fellow
is
more
than
i
for
the
life
of
me
can
see
and
if
he
takes
his
wife
along
as
he
usually
does
or
wishes
to
do
there
is
precious
little
danger
that
one
will
ever
fall
over
the
terrible
precipice
of
intoxication
and
go
down
into
the
bottomless
pit
of
complete
disaster
one
might
say
to
the
reformers
that
for
the
most
part
our
ancestors
imbibed
a
bit
and
here
we
are
thank
you
and
doing
very
nicely
there
has
never
been
a
particle
of
evidence
presented
to
prove
that
teetotalers
live
longer
than
moderate
drinkers
indeed
one
doubts
if
they
live
as
long
and
it
is
well
known
that
those
races
which
refuse
absolutely
to
drink
do
not
produce
anything
of
importance
in
the
way
of
art
and
surely
they
contribute
nothing
to
the
cause
of
science
take
the
mohammedans
name
one
great
artist
among
them
if
you
can
known
to
you
and
me
had
americans
been
a
race
of
drunkards
i
could
understand
this
sudden
drastic
legislation
against
booze
but
we
were
far
from
that
drink
was
beautifully
taking
care
of
itself
it
was
to
consume
too
much
and
the
young
business
man
who
made
it
a
practice
to
indulge
in
even
one
glass
of
beer
at
luncheon
lost
caste
with
his
employer
yes
and
with
his
fellow
workers
he
soon
discovered
the
error
of
his
ways
and
no
longer
found
it
expedient
to
feel
sleepy
in
the
afternoon
when
others
were
alert
and
thoroughly
alive
it
was
only
honest
to
give
to
the
concern
for
which
he
worked
the
flower
of
his
brain
and
heart
and
so
he
passed
up
the
casual
glass
with
little
if
any
reluctance
and
joined
that
great
army
of
temperate
men
and
women
he
did
not
wish
to
be
left
behind
in
the
race
for
glory
and
where
he
had
taken
without
a
qualm
four
cocktails
before
a
now
he
took
only
one
and
sometimes
left
a
drop
or
two
of
that
in
the
glass
i
can
recall
the
time
not
so
many
years
ago
when
everyone
drank
like
a
glutton
country
clubs
were
but
excuses
for
dissipation
were
nothing
but
bars
with
waiters
running
in
and
out
with
trays
of
refreshing
drinks
alas
they
are
worse
than
that
now
thanks
to
our
reformers
but
this
brief
era
passed
through
the
common
sense
of
the
people
themselves
we
did
not
require
legislation
to
cause
us
to
see
whither
we
were
drifting
out
of
our
own
consciousness
we
knew
all
but
a
few
congenital
drunkards
that
way
madness
and
so
we
quit
of
our
own
volition
this
heavy
and
stupid
drinking
the
fellow
worthless
from
the
beginning
was
cut
out
the
man
of
sterling
qualities
and
action
took
his
place
the
became
a
deservedly
abhorrent
creature
unfit
for
the
companionship
of
decent
men
we
came
as
i
see
it
and
i
have
observed
american
life
in
many
spheres
to
a
sense
of
our
own
foolishness
big
business
want
the
toper
big
business
scorned
the
young
clerk
who
followed
the
gay
lights
along
the
gay
white
way
the
fool
who
sat
up
all
night
taking
to
lobster
palaces
with
that
alertness
for
which
the
american
is
famed
our
young
men
realized
that
to
succeed
in
the
realm
of
business
they
would
have
to
turn
over
a
new
leaf
and
they
did
it
i
ask
the
reformers
to
deny
this
if
they
can
there
has
been
no
menace
from
drink
in
this
country
for
many
and
many
a
year
we
never
drank
as
the
english
laboring
man
drinks
or
even
as
the
germans
consume
beer
we
were
as
the
whole
world
is
aware
a
race
of
moderate
drinkers
omitting
always
those
few
and
necessary
exceptions
which
only
serve
to
prove
the
rule
yet
as
a
nation
we
were
indicted
held
up
to
ridicule
and
scorn
we
were
told
that
we
could
not
control
our
appetites
and
so
our
benevolent
government
would
control
them
for
us
and
this
in
the
face
of
the
fact
that
we
learned
to
control
them
i
can
likewise
recall
the
time
not
so
long
ago
when
crowds
of
children
would
follow
some
forlorn
drunkard
being
hauled
to
the
even
though
the
continued
to
flourish
long
after
you
and
i
grew
up
how
many
years
is
it
i
ask
anyone
since
we
have
seen
this
sorry
spectacle
and
as
for
seeing
a
man
lying
prone
in
the
gutter
that
seems
a
prehistoric
incident
to
me
yet
such
incidents
ceased
long
before
national
prohibition
became
an
outrageous
fact
taking
care
of
ourselves
still
we
had
to
be
taken
care
of
ah
in
our
frenzy
to
become
too
pure
let
us
remember
the
dangers
of
benevolent
autocracies
the
state
has
one
definite
function
the
church
another
the
mingling
of
church
and
state
is
not
that
one
of
the
pitfalls
we
have
long
sought
to
avoid
if
the
former
looks
after
our
souls
the
latter
should
be
satisfied
to
see
to
our
bodies
and
that
would
be
duty
enough
let
us
do
a
little
figuring
there
are
approximately
people
in
the
united
states
of
america
of
these
let
us
say
that
are
men
and
women
of
minors
there
are
perhaps
more
among
the
last
named
there
would
be
very
little
drinking
i
imagine
that
of
the
male
population
a
considerable
number
do
not
imbibe
at
all
i
would
rather
err
giving
the
opposition
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
and
so
i
will
say
that
males
drink
in
moderation
and
that
females
do
the
same
this
gives
us
out
of
a
total
population
of
only
people
who
care
anything
at
all
about
liquor
of
that
number
how
many
do
you
think
are
what
might
be
called
immoderate
drinkers
five
million
that
it
seems
to
me
would
be
a
fair
estimate
more
than
fair
but
let
us
be
generous
to
a
fault
of
that
five
million
how
many
are
congenital
drunkards
a
million
perhaps
though
i
doubt
that
even
that
number
have
sunk
so
low
but
let
us
say
that
two
million
have
done
so
then
it
has
become
necessary
to
deprive
people
of
a
simple
form
of
pleasure
because
do
not
know
how
to
manage
their
souls
and
bodies
it
would
be
equally
ridiculous
to
put
an
end
to
connubial
bliss
because
there
are
a
few
libertines
in
the
world
i
remember
as
a
boy
an
unjust
teacher
who
kept
the
whole
class
in
because
one
pupil
whispered
and
she
could
not
discover
the
culprit
i
never
could
understand
her
perverted
sense
of
justice
we
were
guilty
along
with
the
disloyal
little
rascal
who
had
violated
a
rule
we
must
suffer
because
he
would
not
declare
himself
but
drunkards
can
not
conceal
their
wickedness
we
know
them
we
spot
them
they
are
obvious
in
any
community
town
was
as
well
known
as
the
town
pump
it
has
always
been
on
our
statutes
that
intoxication
in
public
constituted
a
misdemeanor
the
penalty
for
a
misdemeanor
is
arrest
trial
and
if
found
guilty
imprisonment
or
the
payment
of
a
fine
few
would
get
drunk
if
they
knew
they
would
be
arrested
we
had
that
law
we
failed
to
enforce
it
hence
the
present
inelastic
laws
heaps
of
them
which
only
complicate
matters
and
make
public
morals
no
better
than
they
were
before
no
better
worse
for
drunkenness
is
rampant
in
the
land
as
it
never
has
been
prohibition
does
everything
but
prohibit
the
very
thing
it
sets
out
to
do
it
fails
to
do
that
is
as
as
the
misery
in
crowded
tenement
districts
in
great
cities
there
is
no
denying
it
people
who
never
drank
before
drink
now
in
enormous
numbers
why
is
this
because
it
is
perfectly
human
to
wish
to
do
what
one
is
told
not
to
do
you
know
the
story
of
the
woman
who
just
before
leaving
the
house
said
solemnly
to
her
children
my
dears
while
i
am
gone
do
not
play
with
the
when
she
came
back
the
house
was
on
fire
all
the
emphasis
having
been
placed
on
drinking
people
are
thinking
of
nothing
drinking
public
bars
have
been
transferred
to
public
and
we
have
the
spectacle
of
numerous
before
a
banquet
premature
roisterers
who
become
so
tight
that
they
can
hardly
get
through
a
course
dinner
it
is
disgraceful
but
i
fear
it
will
never
stop
for
impositions
breed
contempt
for
all
law
and
order
passive
content
finally
breeds
active
rebellion
our
lawmakers
should
have
the
wit
the
vision
the
common
sense
to
realize
that
for
a
whole
nation
to
be
forced
to
be
moral
by
statute
and
mandate
is
so
ridiculous
that
it
must
make
the
gods
laugh
particularly
the
goddess
hebe
when
she
brings
in
the
flowing
bowl
she
must
almost
spill
the
contents
of
her
famous
cup
which
she
has
been
carrying
these
many
cycles
there
is
always
a
reaction
against
enforced
goodness
against
enforced
anything
but
no
sarsaparilla
drinker
ever
realizes
that
he
puts
over
his
and
imagines
that
all
is
well
he
can
not
hear
the
shuffling
of
feet
the
movement
of
armies
in
the
dim
distance
if
he
does
he
mistakes
it
for
applause
the
fact
that
americans
were
taking
care
of
themselves
so
far
as
the
drink
question
was
concerned
makes
the
sudden
appearance
of
the
fanatics
all
the
more
they
came
upon
us
with
gusto
they
are
pathological
any
doctor
will
tell
you
that
and
the
american
people
who
believe
i
am
told
in
life
liberty
and
the
pursuit
of
happiness
permit
themselves
to
be
governed
by
a
pack
of
pathological
cases
who
themselves
should
be
in
wards
if
not
in
padded
cells
and
they
are
not
content
with
this
initial
victory
as
the
irishman
put
it
this
is
prohibition
why
we
have
it
long
ago
and
a
visiting
englishman
exclaimed
looking
our
country
over
when
does
it
start
they
are
going
after
our
tobacco
our
golf
and
motoring
on
the
sabbath
and
they
are
going
to
dip
into
our
cellars
and
rob
us
of
that
which
we
used
to
keep
there
oh
so
seldom
but
now
have
in
great
and
wise
abundance
it
never
occurred
to
any
of
us
in
the
old
halcyon
days
when
one
could
loll
on
the
back
platform
of
a
or
trolley
with
the
glorious
multitude
and
smoke
there
to
keep
a
supply
of
liquor
in
our
homes
if
we
were
giving
a
dinner
and
wished
to
oil
the
social
wheels
just
a
bit
to
start
the
machine
going
we
may
have
sent
to
the
corner
and
bought
a
bottle
of
gin
and
a
little
vermouth
and
perhaps
a
quart
of
simple
california
claret
and
let
it
go
at
that
no
one
disgraced
himself
it
was
all
very
quiet
and
serene
and
sane
and
nice
we
hurt
no
one
we
did
ourselves
no
injury
any
physician
will
tell
you
that
he
needs
whiskey
in
his
practice
if
he
is
the
right
kind
of
physician
and
a
pleasant
time
was
had
by
all
as
the
country
newspapers
say
but
from
that
undramatic
drinking
what
because
of
longface
have
we
leaped
to
to
the
the
sly
treating
in
and
other
places
i
need
hardly
mention
long
before
dinner
begins
so
that
one
may
be
sure
of
a
sensation
which
no
decent
man
should
care
to
experience
a
nervous
tension
is
in
the
air
putting
us
all
back
twenty
years
i
assure
the
reader
that
never
once
in
my
life
did
i
carry
a
flask
of
brandy
even
when
i
was
going
on
a
long
and
dusty
and
tedious
journey
yet
my
dear
mother
was
as
certain
that
i
should
take
one
as
that
i
should
wear
rubbers
when
it
rained
and
i
let
her
believe
i
did
both
for
the
sake
of
her
peace
of
mind
was
my
mother
a
criminal
for
her
quiet
advice
not
then
but
she
would
be
considered
so
now
with
act
on
the
records
of
my
beloved
land
actually
i
am
a
criminal
if
i
take
a
sip
outside
my
home
in
my
club
in
my
travels
if
i
transport
a
little
of
that
whimsical
stuff
of
which
poets
have
sung
so
beautifully
and
often
i
can
be
dragged
to
jail
if
i
am
caught
boo
what
a
mockery
of
personal
freedom
it
all
is
i
heard
a
fine
citizen
say
not
long
ago
a
man
of
wealth
and
position
a
publicist
a
man
of
affairs
i
am
using
the
word
in
its
proper
sense
a
man
who
loved
very
definitely
the
great
america
that
used
to
be
that
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
he
had
the
despicable
thought
that
he
would
like
to
withhold
something
if
he
could
on
his
income
tax
he
felt
little
compunction
for
the
base
thought
why
should
he
hand
his
money
over
to
a
government
which
deprived
him
of
so
much
of
his
personal
liberty
and
held
over
his
head
the
dire
threat
of
further
deprivations
what
was
this
man
getting
out
of
america
he
asked
me
just
a
dull
time
to
be
truthful
he
was
but
one
more
waffle
from
the
great
national
when
he
wanted
diversion
he
must
pack
up
and
fare
to
other
lands
where
living
is
still
living
crave
a
passport
swear
that
he
had
paid
last
tax
produce
a
receipt
he
had
never
received
and
promise
to
pay
this
and
either
not
stay
away
too
long
or
see
to
it
that
his
lawyer
attended
to
it
for
him
everyone
is
ticketed
docketed
labeled
put
in
a
this
tabulation
of
citizens
how
we
smiled
at
it
when
the
prussians
carried
it
to
the
extremes
they
did
poor
creatures
we
said
of
them
to
stand
for
such
arrant
nonsense
a
jolly
state
of
affairs
it
makes
one
feel
so
loving
toward
government
it
we
are
all
children
and
uncle
sam
is
no
longer
a
symbolical
old
figure
but
an
avuncular
autocrat
who
goes
about
nosing
everywhere
almost
invading
the
sanctity
of
our
homes
ah
he
may
do
it
yet
in
his
senseless
quest
for
this
and
that
but
just
as
santa
claus
could
never
get
down
every
chimney
in
the
world
one
feels
certain
that
uncle
sam
can
not
pry
into
every
and
examine
if
he
had
all
eternity
every
tiny
bank
balance
moreover
my
friend
will
not
cheat
on
his
income
tax
he
at
least
is
decent
let
us
not
delude
ourselves
that
we
are
living
in
a
democracy
any
longer
laws
were
passed
from
time
to
time
in
the
history
of
our
great
country
without
the
vote
but
they
were
laws
that
served
our
best
interests
and
did
not
interfere
with
our
personal
liberty
when
our
rights
as
citizens
were
molested
we
got
up
on
our
hind
legs
and
yelled
is
this
we
naturally
inquired
it
is
what
has
always
been
done
came
the
answer
from
the
bar
of
injustice
and
that
was
literally
true
only
we
know
it
break
the
constitution
was
a
further
argument
a
federal
amendment
always
a
federal
amendment
you
and
why
pray
if
the
good
old
iron
constitution
can
not
be
tampered
with
it
is
high
time
that
it
was
if
our
forefathers
who
framed
it
meant
it
to
be
an
utterly
inelastic
document
they
count
on
the
elastic
minds
of
the
american
people
occasions
teach
new
duties
time
makes
ancient
good
uncouth
said
the
wise
james
russell
lowell
once
and
nothing
is
more
certain
than
the
fact
that
the
moment
has
come
when
the
people
should
be
heard
and
not
a
handful
of
legislators
who
rushed
madly
to
lay
in
a
stock
of
wine
and
spirits
when
they
saw
which
way
the
wind
was
blowing
their
straws
it
grieved
me
as
a
good
american
to
hear
an
englishman
say
the
other
evening
before
a
lot
of
my
that
his
idea
of
a
complete
life
would
be
to
spend
nine
months
of
the
year
in
england
as
a
british
and
three
months
in
the
united
states
as
an
american
there
was
much
mirth
but
somehow
i
could
not
laugh
and
i
hope
these
constitutional
amendments
coming
so
thick
and
fast
are
not
causing
me
to
lose
my
sense
of
humor
it
was
a
statement
in
which
so
much
of
truth
was
compressed
that
i
shuddered
and
i
thought
of
all
the
forms
of
that
have
lately
been
foisted
upon
us
i
recalled
how
ten
years
ago
a
friend
of
mine
had
returned
from
germany
and
told
me
laughingly
how
the
poor
subjects
of
the
kaiser
were
eternally
forbidden
to
do
this
and
that
it
was
everywhere
the
eye
turned
in
the
parks
in
restaurants
in
the
galleries
in
the
theaters
everywhere
always
some
petty
restriction
some
tyrannical
interference
with
the
masses
and
he
said
then
how
contrary
to
the
broad
american
spirit
was
this
constant
stress
on
shalt
we
both
smiled
over
it
and
pitied
the
and
controlled
germans
a
glorious
land
we
live
in
we
said
in
unison
lifting
our
glasses
how
proud
we
are
of
our
but
could
we
honestly
say
that
now
do
not
let
us
be
hypocrites
before
foreigners
we
bravely
and
loyally
uphold
our
form
of
government
because
one
does
not
like
to
cleanse
his
soiled
linen
in
public
or
reveal
a
family
quarrel
but
deep
down
in
our
hearts
i
hear
it
discussed
everywhere
i
go
is
a
feeling
of
apprehension
and
the
everlasting
question
is
being
asked
are
we
as
a
people
being
led
if
the
political
machinery
is
being
clogged
with
too
many
foolish
and
unnecessary
laws
that
are
merely
jokers
and
venemous
restrictions
why
do
we
not
speak
out
in
meeting
call
together
groups
of
citizens
as
we
are
privileged
to
do
under
the
constitution
unless
another
amendment
has
been
added
since
this
was
written
and
protest
against
this
extravagant
misuse
of
power
the
reason
england
has
always
been
such
a
comfortable
country
to
live
in
is
because
of
the
spirit
of
constructive
criticism
that
has
filtered
through
the
nation
if
a
londoner
does
not
like
the
service
on
the
tram
roads
he
writes
to
the
about
it
and
the
matter
is
adjusted
he
has
the
backing
of
all
his
neighbors
and
ten
to
one
they
have
written
too
but
how
many
americans
insulted
in
the
subway
or
by
some
public
servant
will
sit
down
and
write
a
letter
of
complaint
we
stand
meekly
like
droves
of
cattle
behind
tapes
in
pressed
by
eager
little
ushers
endowed
with
a
momentary
authority
until
released
and
permitted
to
fumble
our
way
down
dark
aisles
to
such
seats
as
we
can
find
we
allow
grand
to
hold
us
in
check
when
we
enter
a
smart
restaurant
not
indeed
behind
tape
but
behind
a
silken
cord
which
does
not
mitigate
the
insult
however
and
we
humbly
beg
them
to
see
if
they
can
get
us
a
table
and
some
of
us
slip
them
a
greenback
to
gain
their
august
favor
we
allow
ticket
speculators
to
buy
up
all
the
best
places
in
our
theaters
adding
what
profit
they
demand
and
say
nothing
though
there
is
a
statute
forbidding
such
extortion
here
for
a
good
time
and
we
care
what
it
costs
us
is
the
answer
of
the
average
visitor
to
the
metropolis
when
he
is
asked
why
he
does
not
protest
against
such
unjust
measures
i
have
known
only
one
rich
man
to
refuse
rooms
at
a
fine
hotel
simply
because
he
felt
it
wrong
to
pay
seventeen
dollars
a
day
no
matter
what
his
bank
balance
it
is
people
like
that
who
help
the
rest
of
us
to
a
return
to
normal
conditions
he
thinks
of
someone
but
himself
yet
we
talk
of
prohibition
as
though
we
were
manfully
trying
to
save
the
next
generation
from
the
perils
of
drink
we
are
doing
nothing
of
the
sort
we
are
merely
bowing
our
craven
heads
to
a
mandate
because
we
have
neither
the
courage
nor
the
energy
to
speak
loudly
against
a
stupid
law
foisted
upon
us
by
an
organized
minority
our
altruistic
purpose
is
not
apparent
for
it
never
existed
but
someone
whispers
majority
want
this
and
that
so
we
must
give
in
to
even
so
why
should
we
give
in
to
them
the
majority
of
people
prefer
flashy
meaningless
movies
and
pollyanna
and
harold
bell
wright
and
and
cheap
jewelry
and
gopher
prairie
and
slapstick
humor
and
loud
laughter
and
a
crowded
beach
on
sunday
and
hideous
neckties
and
shirts
and
summer
furs
and
a
hundred
and
one
other
things
entirely
foreign
to
my
desires
why
then
should
i
walk
in
their
path
jump
over
the
hurdles
that
the
multitude
puts
in
front
of
me
arnold
bennett
once
said
that
the
classics
were
kept
alive
not
by
the
man
in
the
street
but
by
the
passionate
few
he
was
dead
right
in
the
words
of
your
beloved
majority
he
said
a
mouthful
now
because
my
neighbor
and
my
neighbor
have
a
weakness
for
the
not
the
best
cellars
and
find
a
robust
pleasure
in
never
thinking
of
anything
beyond
baseball
i
do
not
see
why
i
should
be
forced
to
indulge
in
a
stupid
pollyanna
optimism
and
forget
and
neglect
my
keats
and
shakespeare
chapter
v
making
the
world
safe
for
what
psychological
effect
will
this
constant
contempt
for
the
law
of
the
land
have
upon
us
as
a
people
surely
something
dire
and
dreadful
is
seeping
into
the
national
spirit
and
we
are
in
grave
danger
of
coming
to
a
human
dislike
of
all
laws
in
consequence
we
talk
of
prohibition
as
a
good
thing
for
the
generations
to
come
but
how
about
disregard
for
the
law
as
it
will
affect
our
children
and
our
children
drunk
they
might
not
be
responsible
sober
to
their
higher
selves
they
are
accountable
for
their
shortcomings
in
regard
to
our
statutes
a
lack
of
veneration
for
an
orderly
carrying
out
of
a
mandate
is
a
serious
thing
but
to
hear
the
young
people
talking
these
days
about
the
sanctity
of
the
eighteenth
amendment
is
not
a
heartening
experience
they
jeer
at
it
and
openly
roar
with
laughter
when
it
is
mentioned
no
one
wishes
danger
to
overwhelm
us
but
it
will
unless
something
is
done
to
remedy
the
present
abhorrent
conditions
which
i
repeat
are
making
most
of
us
unhappy
we
are
entangled
in
too
many
legal
nets
and
it
is
not
pleasing
and
edifying
to
see
an
or
jurist
who
came
out
strong
for
prohibition
sitting
night
after
night
in
a
certain
restaurant
imbibing
his
cocktail
creating
scandal
in
a
more
than
crowded
room
he
is
not
in
his
cups
these
days
only
in
his
i
wonder
if
he
knows
what
an
example
he
sets
to
the
flappers
down
the
room
and
with
what
derision
his
public
utterances
are
now
greeted
whenever
he
opens
his
mouth
to
speak
between
drinks
i
hear
men
and
women
saying
all
the
time
is
no
place
to
live
now
the
streets
of
our
large
cities
at
night
look
like
villages
in
some
remote
district
dull
dull
and
drab
drab
one
more
tyrannical
law
one
shadow
of
that
deep
blue
which
imperils
us
and
we
will
go
and
live
abroad
anywhere
but
is
that
pleasant
talk
to
listen
to
does
it
make
one
proud
to
be
an
american
it
is
not
well
to
have
such
feelings
fomenting
in
the
hearts
of
those
who
honestly
and
sincerely
love
their
native
land
love
it
so
much
that
during
a
terrible
war
they
were
proud
to
offer
to
die
for
it
or
allow
their
sons
to
die
for
it
but
this
is
not
the
time
to
desert
the
old
ship
of
state
now
as
never
before
the
united
states
needs
its
best
blood
its
best
workers
its
best
citizens
to
put
the
country
back
where
it
belongs
it
is
because
i
love
america
so
that
i
do
not
wish
to
see
her
make
a
complete
fool
of
herself
as
she
is
doing
every
day
now
and
i
say
it
as
loudly
as
i
can
that
these
pernicious
laws
this
spirit
of
is
only
making
the
world
safe
for
it
was
montaigne
who
said
that
he
was
the
opinion
that
it
would
be
better
for
us
to
have
no
laws
at
all
than
to
have
them
in
so
prodigious
numbers
as
we
and
that
was
how
long
ago
what
would
he
write
and
think
of
america
if
he
could
live
among
us
today
and
further
he
said
knowing
human
nature
as
few
of
us
know
it
is
no
man
so
good
who
were
he
to
submit
all
his
thoughts
and
actions
to
the
laws
would
not
deserve
hanging
ten
times
in
his
yet
the
silly
go
on
with
their
silly
codes
piling
pelion
on
the
top
of
ossa
till
all
sight
of
frailty
is
lost
little
folly
is
desirable
in
him
that
will
not
be
guilty
of
yet
the
letter
of
the
law
must
be
upheld
and
the
very
men
who
make
our
statutes
continue
to
break
them
the
joke
may
go
too
far
the
american
people
may
remember
that
vigilance
is
the
price
of
and
be
willing
to
watch
and
wait
lest
that
most
precious
of
all
things
be
taken
away
from
them
there
can
be
no
disputing
the
fact
that
a
law
that
is
not
enforced
is
worse
than
no
law
at
all
law
and
order
that
is
the
phrase
but
america
is
a
country
of
law
and
disorder
and
the
worst
of
it
all
is
that
the
reformers
refuse
to
stop
where
they
have
they
are
preparing
to
plunge
us
into
even
deeper
gloom
why
should
they
rest
having
been
so
eminently
successful
already
we
used
to
laugh
tolerantly
at
the
compulsory
military
service
of
the
germans
under
the
kaiser
but
a
compulsory
seat
upon
the
just
about
as
autocratic
country
of
thee
should
be
our
national
anthem
since
we
are
seriously
looking
for
one
to
take
the
place
of
the
but
no
the
words
would
not
ring
true
for
there
is
a
wetness
all
around
us
and
the
lyric
of
a
national
anthem
should
at
least
seek
to
express
the
ideals
and
aspirations
of
a
people
in
terms
of
truth
yet
before
prohibition
who
would
have
thought
of
picking
out
america
as
the
wettest
of
all
countries
we
were
just
moderately
so
we
had
no
desire
to
get
a
reputation
for
excessive
dampness
it
is
the
drys
who
have
given
us
that
reputation
against
our
will
and
the
pity
of
it
is
that
the
tag
will
remain
even
after
we
are
sanely
and
becomingly
wet
again
the
reformers
wish
no
going
back
to
even
a
semblance
of
the
old
ways
and
days
they
wish
us
to
conform
sedately
forgetting
that
emerson
once
wrote
would
be
a
man
must
be
a
and
somehow
i
go
on
believing
in
emerson
there
was
some
wild
talk
not
so
many
months
ago
that
it
might
become
lawful
to
dispense
beer
from
the
but
sensible
people
who
care
for
their
toddy
delectable
word
were
not
thrilled
they
no
more
wish
beer
served
from
than
they
wish
served
from
they
want
their
toddy
and
when
they
say
so
firmly
dear
and
my
and
is
awful
cry
the
prohibitionists
i
always
somehow
get
back
to
that
argument
of
the
upholders
of
the
eighteenth
amendment
to
the
effect
that
prohibition
is
a
good
thing
particularly
for
the
next
generation
i
feel
like
asking
them
in
absolute
seriousness
then
why
not
look
to
the
when
i
was
a
lad
we
used
to
drink
simple
little
things
like
vanilla
strawberry
and
chocolate
sodas
at
five
cents
apiece
and
we
were
happy
over
harmless
lemon
and
cherry
phosphates
yet
the
other
day
when
i
chanced
to
step
into
a
confectionery
shop
i
was
nonplussed
to
hear
sophisticated
flappers
what
tautology
ordering
raspberry
nut
sundaes
and
banana
splits
with
chocolate
sauce
and
other
concoctions
which
my
bewildered
brain
refuses
to
remember
and
when
i
saw
the
little
silver
dishes
heaped
with
these
vicious
sweets
i
was
horrified
gluttony
pure
and
simple
and
what
of
dyspepsia
and
indigestion
and
complexions
after
partaking
for
a
few
weeks
of
such
stuff
does
no
one
care
enough
for
the
coming
race
to
do
something
about
it
i
have
seen
hulking
men
enter
such
a
shop
at
nine
in
the
morning
hastily
tear
off
an
soda
containing
i
know
not
what
flavoring
and
dash
out
again
into
the
world
of
business
what
must
the
lining
of
their
stomachs
be
like
no
habitual
drunkard
could
show
a
worse
record
i
imagine
and
of
the
two
i
would
prefer
the
latter
at
least
he
is
human
the
is
a
sensualist
knowing
nothing
of
the
healthy
ecstasy
of
comradeship
he
is
a
solitary
drinker
of
the
worst
sort
and
though
he
may
not
stagger
out
of
the
place
he
is
certainly
unfit
to
begin
his
work
just
as
unfit
as
the
fool
who
makes
it
a
practice
to
take
a
nip
of
scotch
before
breakfast
seriously
here
is
work
for
the
reformers
let
them
investigate
the
kind
of
mixtures
that
are
served
to
our
youngsters
at
of
one
per
cent
of
raspberry
should
be
all
that
is
permitted
a
solemn
bill
should
be
introduced
into
the
next
legislature
and
carried
by
an
overwhelming
majority
it
is
unthinkable
that
our
youth
should
be
exposed
to
the
evils
of
sundaes
sold
openly
all
along
our
avenues
and
boulevards
in
every
city
and
town
and
hamlet
it
is
madness
to
let
this
traffic
go
on
and
there
are
not
even
any
to
hide
the
sundae
fiends
shamelessly
they
imbibe
their
drinks
with
the
world
passing
the
unshaded
windows
looking
in
at
them
a
shocking
state
of
affairs
yet
who
is
doing
anything
about
it
no
wonder
little
alice
of
the
pale
face
does
not
eat
much
luncheon
her
mother
worries
over
her
anemic
condition
yet
she
will
not
take
the
time
to
investigate
the
daily
habits
she
never
inquires
how
she
spends
her
allowance
and
young
bobby
who
formerly
was
so
rosy
and
plump
deteriorates
into
a
boy
no
he
smoke
and
as
yet
he
has
not
acquired
the
habit
what
then
is
the
matter
with
him
that
he
drops
out
of
baseball
and
has
no
heart
for
tennis
that
he
is
backward
in
his
studies
and
sleeps
restlessly
on
his
way
to
school
he
stops
in
at
the
and
on
his
way
home
he
stops
in
once
more
surely
the
government
should
issue
cards
and
make
it
a
misdemeanor
for
a
clerk
to
serve
more
than
one
soda
a
week
to
minors
and
the
board
of
health
should
do
something
about
it
you
see
if
it
one
thing
another
in
this
troubled
world
no
sooner
do
we
mop
up
the
saloon
than
we
find
other
places
in
need
of
mopping
parents
and
social
workers
here
is
a
job
for
you
get
at
it
at
once
forthwith
instanter
immediately
the
future
welfare
of
the
race
is
at
stake
if
it
were
only
that
the
children
drank
but
here
again
one
can
not
control
the
appetites
of
human
beings
we
have
closed
the
corner
saloon
is
there
no
way
of
closing
the
corner
it
is
curious
in
these
days
when
there
is
so
much
understanding
even
among
flappers
of
and
complexes
that
no
one
seems
to
have
called
attention
to
the
fact
that
the
prohibitionists
are
the
greatest
living
examples
of
certain
distressing
inhibitions
that
the
majority
of
us
should
find
ourselves
suddenly
dictated
to
told
literally
what
we
should
and
should
not
put
into
our
own
little
private
tummies
is
beyond
belief
what
does
a
man
who
has
never
taken
a
drink
know
of
the
psychology
of
drink
what
does
he
know
of
of
the
poetry
of
the
toast
of
the
beauties
of
i
would
as
soon
think
of
mary
walker
telling
and
how
to
make
love
the
set
lips
of
the
fanatical
reformer
are
the
outward
evidence
of
an
interior
set
of
corroding
inhibitions
unable
to
get
relief
from
the
tedium
of
existence
in
say
a
town
like
gopher
prairie
the
subject
moves
in
his
or
her
later
years
to
minneapolis
or
some
other
larger
city
and
is
next
heard
of
as
a
professional
reformer
of
one
sort
or
another
i
remember
a
young
man
in
my
class
at
school
who
was
impossible
as
a
playboy
because
he
always
wanted
to
rule
the
roost
to
dictate
everlastingly
the
manner
in
which
any
game
we
sought
to
enjoy
should
be
played
he
was
never
content
to
be
just
one
of
us
oh
no
he
must
run
things
order
us
about
be
a
dictator
and
a
little
czar
an
autocrat
of
the
most
unbending
kind
we
despised
him
he
could
never
fall
into
line
and
be
boyishly
human
he
could
not
yield
he
could
not
adjust
himself
to
the
spirit
of
fun
which
we
others
abandoned
ourselves
to
with
youthful
ease
he
was
just
a
common
scold
he
disappeared
from
our
and
from
our
lives
years
later
when
the
war
broke
out
he
turned
up
in
a
remote
town
as
a
shrieking
radical
nothing
was
right
he
had
worked
out
his
destiny
in
the
only
way
such
a
nature
as
his
could
possibly
do
he
a
good
sport
worse
he
even
a
good
citizen
he
amount
to
a
row
of
pins
he
even
worth
interning
he
interesting
enough
to
get
the
slightest
notoriety
he
what
the
newspapers
term
good
copy
and
that
broke
his
heart
i
have
no
doubt
that
now
with
the
war
over
he
is
a
professional
prohibitionist
or
do
i
mean
inhibitionist
with
a
soft
job
at
some
desk
he
would
never
be
happy
anywhere
but
in
such
a
position
interfering
with
normal
happiness
he
would
be
as
happy
as
he
could
be
it
is
exactly
men
and
women
like
him
who
have
slipped
over
some
of
the
laws
we
now
have
and
who
are
planning
statutes
against
staying
away
from
church
on
sunday
but
an
old
story
the
intelligent
people
in
every
community
are
forever
allowing
themselves
to
be
duped
by
and
manipulators
snake
doctors
and
a
spirit
is
in
the
land
like
a
glass
of
wine
never
tasted
the
nasty
stuff
so
i
want
you
to
taste
it
this
is
the
cry
of
the
paid
reformers
who
eke
out
a
living
by
taking
up
some
fad
and
having
nothing
interesting
of
their
own
to
reveal
peep
and
eavesdrop
and
reveal
the
interesting
traits
of
their
innocently
jovial
and
erstwhile
happy
brothers
we
have
enough
complexities
in
our
modern
life
without
having
the
complexes
of
these
and
evangelists
made
public
day
by
day
of
course
the
natural
human
being
is
he
who
indulges
in
everything
in
moderation
show
me
the
man
who
constantly
denies
himself
something
and
i
will
show
you
an
abnormal
man
he
becomes
obsessed
with
his
as
he
dares
to
call
it
and
he
can
not
talk
ten
minutes
without
mentioning
his
he
revels
in
it
he
gloats
over
it
he
delights
in
it
just
as
the
monks
of
old
delighted
in
the
and
he
thinks
he
is
better
than
we
are
soon
he
begins
to
preach
he
is
like
the
old
woman
who
committed
a
sin
in
her
early
youth
and
still
loves
to
talk
about
it
he
does
not
know
how
boring
he
is
he
does
not
know
how
little
a
part
he
plays
in
society
he
is
just
a
bit
a
trifle
queer
the
next
step
in
this
form
of
madness
is
to
try
to
impose
own
ideas
upon
neighbors
soon
proselytizing
must
be
done
the
energy
of
years
must
be
released
in
middle
age
steam
must
be
let
off
blood
pressure
must
be
reduced
if
these
would
only
lock
themselves
up
in
cells
and
flagellate
themselves
they
would
find
comfort
and
release
from
their
agony
of
mind
and
a
weary
world
would
be
grateful
but
no
they
must
stalk
through
the
land
imposing
their
moral
rectitude
upon
the
rest
of
us
we
have
up
to
now
humored
them
smiled
tolerantly
at
them
secretly
pitied
them
but
with
shrewdness
and
cruelty
they
have
plotted
and
planned
for
years
quietly
banded
together
until
now
they
are
joined
in
a
great
brotherhood
and
instead
of
locking
themselves
up
they
have
locked
us
up
and
maliciously
gleefully
thrown
away
the
key
we
should
have
been
their
keepers
instead
they
are
ours
an
occasional
little
spree
as
a
wise
frenchman
once
said
never
hurt
anybody
it
is
necessary
for
people
of
imagination
to
romp
and
play
once
in
a
while
what
form
that
romping
and
playing
takes
is
their
own
affair
so
long
as
they
do
not
injure
their
neighbors
they
may
express
themselves
in
terms
of
smoking
of
flirting
or
sitting
up
all
night
and
talking
their
heads
off
or
they
may
take
a
long
walk
in
the
rain
or
go
to
the
movies
for
several
hours
or
read
an
exciting
but
impossible
detective
story
which
is
by
no
means
a
waste
of
time
or
dance
or
go
fishing
or
attend
an
elks
picnic
or
buy
their
wives
a
diamond
bracelet
or
indulge
in
an
speech
or
see
a
foolish
musical
comedy
there
are
a
thousand
and
one
ways
to
let
off
steam
they
come
back
from
any
one
of
these
a
hundred
per
cent
better
in
mind
and
body
and
plunge
into
the
serious
business
of
life
with
a
fresh
stimulus
a
new
zest
but
the
prohibitionist
what
form
do
his
inhibitions
take
orgy
is
one
of
complete
surrender
to
an
orgy
of
holding
in
forever
he
never
lets
go
never
not
for
one
second
and
just
as
the
hermit
enjoys
his
solitude
he
revels
in
his
punishment
and
without
wishing
to
be
cynical
i
say
that
he
gets
a
certain
drab
satisfaction
in
this
stupid
disciplining
of
himself
the
remorse
of
the
is
unknown
to
him
but
without
realizing
it
every
morning
he
experiences
a
mental
he
has
never
lived
through
one
normal
day
the
pendulum
for
him
swings
completely
in
the
other
direction
and
he
is
happy
only
when
he
is
unhappy
but
and
where
you
and
i
come
in
he
is
not
content
with
this
exquisite
unhappiness
he
wants
us
to
be
unhappy
too
pathological
you
see
heretofore
the
temperance
people
looked
upon
all
drinkers
heavy
or
light
as
wounded
souls
medical
cases
but
we
who
drink
and
smoke
and
laugh
in
moderation
are
the
normal
people
of
the
world
the
others
are
those
who
are
in
need
of
treatment
the
tables
have
been
turned
thanks
to
and
freud
and
the
open
door
that
leads
to
the
light
of
medical
science
a
bunch
of
sour
grapes
have
robbed
us
of
our
sweet
grapes
why
because
they
could
not
stand
the
thought
of
joy
being
in
the
world
they
want
everyone
to
be
as
miserable
as
they
are
having
succeeded
so
easily
in
taking
away
one
of
our
joys
do
you
think
these
fanatics
are
content
if
so
you
know
them
not
their
victory
has
been
accomplished
so
simply
that
of
course
they
are
now
looking
about
for
new
worlds
to
conquer
they
set
their
mouths
grit
their
teeth
look
us
over
impale
us
on
a
pin
and
see
where
next
they
can
turn
on
the
screws
they
take
a
fiendish
delight
in
inflicting
punishment
that
is
part
of
their
disease
their
suppressed
desires
find
expression
in
robbing
us
of
our
natural
pleasure
they
are
cunning
and
keen
and
wise
with
the
curious
and
dangerous
wisdom
of
the
insane
they
think
they
are
sent
into
the
world
to
redeem
it
they
have
the
messiah
complex
they
have
the
delusion
of
greatness
and
when
we
venture
to
question
their
methods
and
motives
they
hurl
invectives
back
at
us
and
cry
are
persecuting
us
they
have
paranoia
you
see
they
would
kill
us
actually
rather
than
give
us
one
sip
of
beer
and
these
are
the
people
who
have
temporarily
gained
the
upper
hand
mad
on
one
subject
they
appear
perfectly
balanced
while
lobbying
in
the
legislatures
of
the
land
obsessed
with
one
idea
they
can
talk
intelligently
on
every
other
subject
but
sooner
or
later
they
will
switch
the
conversation
to
their
pet
theory
and
then
i
ask
you
to
note
the
gleam
in
their
eyes
see
their
lips
twitch
watch
how
nervous
they
become
yes
pathological
cases
every
one
of
them
when
will
the
prohibitionists
understand
that
it
is
not
drink
that
thinking
people
are
fighting
for
the
people
are
roused
to
action
and
alarm
because
of
the
dangerous
precedent
that
has
been
set
if
we
as
a
nation
are
to
be
deprived
of
legitimate
and
friendly
lovely
word
again
when
new
year
comes
round
why
in
the
name
of
heaven
can
we
not
be
deprived
of
eggs
they
make
one
bilious
i
am
told
and
biliousness
is
bad
for
one
come
let
us
correct
it
but
having
taken
away
the
dangerous
egg
let
us
poke
about
and
see
what
else
one
can
remove
ah
there
it
is
of
course
coffee
coffee
makes
one
nervous
nervousness
is
awful
coffee
keeps
one
awake
but
why
remain
awake
in
a
world
that
has
lost
its
glamour
remove
our
coffee
then
gladly
we
permit
you
to
take
it
for
then
we
can
go
blissfully
to
sleep
and
forget
our
worries
and
cares
it
has
been
loudly
denied
that
lobbying
is
being
done
to
bring
about
the
passage
of
further
drastic
laws
but
the
busybodies
are
secretly
working
night
and
day
the
deadly
work
goes
on
unabated
of
course
they
are
not
crying
their
methods
from
the
housetops
sinister
forces
are
burrowing
deep
and
frightened
legislators
will
be
forced
to
follow
the
path
they
took
before
the
eighteenth
amendment
went
through
you
remember
that
wonderfully
satirical
story
of
mark
man
that
corrupted
hadleyburg
you
and
what
happened
to
a
town
that
imposed
righteousness
upon
the
inhabitants
all
temptation
having
been
beneficently
removed
when
one
little
chance
came
to
misbehave
the
entire
village
leaped
at
it
and
was
thoroughly
corrupted
there
is
some
fun
in
passing
a
saloon
in
going
voluntarily
on
the
in
refusing
that
extra
cocktail
there
is
none
whatever
in
having
someone
else
do
it
for
you
our
prayers
may
be
dictated
to
us
next
but
something
tells
us
that
if
prohibitionists
formulate
them
they
have
no
more
chance
than
ours
of
being
heard
in
heaven
a
world
made
safe
for
us
by
reformers
is
the
last
kind
of
world
we
care
to
dwell
in
for
reformers
are
the
kind
of
people
who
paint
heaven
as
a
stupid
city
of
golden
streets
and
pearly
gates
and
incessant
singing
and
playing
of
harps
well
as
omar
said
heaven
is
not
prohibitionists
i
am
genuinely
sorry
for
you
you
need
not
pity
me
for
i
shall
go
on
doing
as
i
please
despite
you
and
so
will
millions
of
other

that
make
you
frantically
desperate
does
that
make
you
have
another
attack
of
your
symptoms
do
you
puff
up
with
rage
and
despair
when
you
hear
me
say
such
things
in
open
defiance
of
you
keeper
bring
in
the
straitjacket
and
sweep
out
as
goldberg
says
padded
cell
no
for
the
pathological
ward
is
overcrowded
today
they
have
just
brought
in
a
frightfully
man
who
believes
in
the
blue
laws
and
he
must
have
gone
quite
mad
for
he
is
singing

he
claims

chapter
vi
the
infamous
volstead
act
there
are
seven
articles
in
the
original
constitution
of
the
united
states
of
america
there
are
nineteen
amendments
to
date
the
fifteenth
amendment
has
never
been
taken
seriously
in
certain
of
the
southern
states
and
the
eighteenth
amendment
has
caused
more
dissension
than
any
law
ever
placed
upon
our
statutes
the
volstead
act
which
is
but
an
enforcing
act
of
the
amendment
is
highly
unpopular
after
three
years
of
trying
to
coerce
the
people
into
obeying
a
mandate
in
which
millions
of
them
do
not
believe
are
we
to
continue
to
do
so
or
are
we
sensibly
to
wipe
it
out
the
money
consumed
by
the
government
in
attempting
to
have
this
vicious
law
obeyed
and
respected
should
cause
every
american
to
blush
we
are
gradually
nay
swiftly
getting
to
a
point
where
practically
every
citizen
will
be
watched
and
guarded
by
another
daily
habits
will
be
observed
perhaps
by
neighbor
or
the
janitor
in
basement
there
is
no
telling
who
is
a
detective
nowadays
and
there
is
no
telling
who
is
a
bootlegger
maybe
one
is
the
other
how
far
away
we
have
wandered
from
those
early
principles
of
the
signers
of
the
declaration
of
independence
and
the
makers
of
the
constitution
liberty
liberty
how
many
crimes
are
committed
in
thy
name
cried
madame
roland
and
bertrand
barère
exclaimed
tree
of
liberty
only
grows
when
watered
by
the
blood
of
the
volstead
act
is
the
most
tyrannous
document
a
people
have
ever
had
thrust
upon
them
i
wonder
how
many
americans
have
read
it
studied
it
pondered
over
it
i
wish
we
might
read
the
thoughts
of
all
the
men
who
cast
their
votes
for
this
infamous
piece
of
legislation
i
wish
we
might
search
their
consciences
know
of
their
secret
emotions
when
they
assented
to
its
restricting
sections
it
would
be
folly
to
reproduce
the
entire
document
here
with
its
tangle
of
legal
verbiage
its
intricate
twists
and
turns
its
complicated
sentences
which
to
the
layman
mean
so
little
but
to
the
mean
so
much
through
a
thick
underbrush
of
paragraphs
the
legal
mind
wanders
at
will
delightfully
and
miraculously
at
home
and
finally
imagines
that
it
emerges
into
the
sunlight
of
knowledge
and
wisdom
plain
folk
like
you
and
me
find
it
difficult
to
follow
the
gypsy
patteran
and
patter
yet
somehow
we
get
the
sense
of
this
appalling
mass
of
words
words
that
seem
to
have
handcuffs
attached
to
them
words
that
hint
of
prison
cells
and
donjonkeeps
words
that
mystify
and
frighten
us
we
feel
so
guilty
as
we
traverse
them
and
remembering
the
violations
of
this
sacrosanct
paper
which
we
have
witnessed
since
its
solemn
passage
we
marvel
at
the
energy
expended
to
make
us
all
good
and
holy
citizens
i
was
going
to
say
but
i
think
with
the
englishman
subjects
would
be
nearer
the
truth
for
a
high
and
mighty
absolute
monarchy
never
weighed
its
people
down
with
heavier
bonds
no
land
ever
knew
more
complete
and
devastating
tyranny
the
burdens
heaped
upon
the
shoulders
of
the
already
weary
so
that
the
of
this
act
may
be
upheld
ah
few
of
us
ever
consider
these
we
have
grown
so
used
to
added
packs
that
one
more
dollar
seems
to
make
little
difference
but
it
was
the
last
straw
that
broke
the
back
and
who
knows
how
much
longer
we
can
stand
these
accumulating
and
distressing
burdens

it

the

heard
the

instead
of
being

cowering

the

half
of

willfully
disobey

our

do
not
make
pleasant
reading
for
good
americans
these
days
they
are
filled
with
headlines
which
concern
the
prohibition
law
morning
after
morning
not
long
ago
i
picked
up
my
newspaper
and
found
no
less
than
seventeen
columns
devoted
to
stories
of
what
the
police
in
new
york
city
alone
were
doing
or
trying
to
do
to
make
the
volstead
act
anything
but
a
huge
joke
up
the
state
where
farmers
are
paying
good
taxes
i
found
a
delicious
item
in
a
newspaper
to
prove
the
sincerity
of
the
federal
authorities
it
seems
that
in
a
small
town
near
utica
an
italian
was
suspected
of
having
some
whiskey
on
his
premises
and
three
stalwart
officers
in
plain
clothes
pounced
down
upon
his
shop
it
was
not
a
rum
shop
to
see
what
they
could
find
the
man
was
out
but
his
wife
was
at
home
and
a
careful
search
of
the
pitiful
premises
revealed
a
quart
of
scotch
which
may
or
may
not
have
been
on
sale
it
took
three
husky
men
three
hours
to
make
this
startling
discovery
and
how
much
of
the
money
i
wonder
it
was
that
an
arrest
should
take
place
but
there
was
no
evidence
and
nothing
further
was
ever
heard
of
the
matter
and
this
which
sounds
as
though
it
had
occurred
in
benighted
russia
greeted
my
eyes
at
breakfast
one
morning
in
the
new
york
jersey
police
of
brutal
dry
raid
way
into
rooms
and
insulted
them
resort
residents
charge
conduct
of
eighteen
of
the
new
jersey
state
police
who
participated
with
federal
prohibition
agents
in
liquor
raids
on
hotels
and
other
places
in
lake
hopatcong
tuesday
night
was
such
that
indignant
residents
threatened
yesterday
to
complain
to
governor
edwards
the
great
cove
hotel
at
point
the
police
are
alleged
to
have
gone
to
the
room
of
a
waiter
and
his
wife
and
demanded
that
they
show
their
marriage
certificate
it
is
also
charged
that
they
went
to
the
room
of
two
girls
one
of
whom
was
praying
and
insisted
that
they
open
the
door
the
police
searched
the
belongings
of
the
girls
for
whiskey
is
charged
that
at
the
espanol
hotel
point
the
police
went
to
the
room
of
a
mother
and
her
three
children
awakened
her
and
charged
there
was
a
man
in
her
room
she
was
compelled
to
open
her
door
cottages
it
is
charged
also
were
visited
and
searched
it
is
charged
by
the
complainants
that
the
state
police
drank
the
beer
and
whiskey
they
but
of
course
this
is
all
right
to
a
prohibitionist
the
law
must
be
enforced
it
makes
no
difference
how
enforcement
is
accomplished
if
the
police
were
honest
if
they
themselves
approved
of
the
eighteenth
amendment
the
country
could
be
made
bone
dry
tomorrow
but
when
the
politicians
who
voted
for
prohibition
have
no
respect
for
the
law
they
put
upon
our
statutes
why
should
we
expect
integrity
and
honesty
down
the
line
how
can
there
be
any
respect
for
a
law
which
the
minions
of
the
law
disobey
repeatedly
in
a
great
city
like
new
york
in
the
autumn
of
innumerable
policemen
were
found
drunk
while
on
duty
so
much
drunkenness
had
occurred
that
it
was
said
on
reliable
authority
that
a
murder
a
week
occurred
must
tell
how
they
got
was
the
heading
in
the
new
york
on
october
regulations
for
dealing
with
policemen
who
have
been
framed
and
have
been
circulated
in
the
police
department
this
is
the
text
of
the
orders
think
of
their
being
necessary
to
the
commanding
officers
following
memorandum
from
the
police
commissioner
is
for
your
information
and
guidance
mount
vernon
any
person
found
publicly
intoxicated
is
arrested
and
required
to
make
an
affidavit
stating
where
he
obtained
the
liquor
causing
the
intoxication
this
affidavit
is
made
the
basis
of
a
search
warrant
directing
a
search
of
the
place
selling
the
liquor
is
but
one
of
the
many
means
which
might
be
employed
to
put
an
end
to
violation
of
the
prohibition
law
the
plan
seems
to
work
out
successfully
in
mount
vernon
intoxicated
members
of
the
force
when
members
of
the
force
are
found
to
be
suffering
from
alcoholism
to
such
an
extent
as
to
warrant
charges
signifying
the
liquor
has
been
obtained
from
persons
who
are
violating
the
state
prohibition
law
request
the
officers
to
make
an
affidavit
stating
where
they
obtained
this
liquor
take
appropriate
action
in
the
premises
if
it
is
found
that
the
officers
have
failed
to
take
proper
action
where
the
law
has
been
violated
additional
charges
should
be
preferred
against
them
and
if
the
case
is
a
serious
one
they
should
be
suspended
from
duty
cabarets
and
dance
halls
and
dance
halls
having
resumed
business
for
the
fall
and
winter
season
will
be
carefully
inspected
from
time
to
time
and
properly
regulated
the
majority
of
these
places
disregard
provisions
of
the
prohibition
law
and
should
be
given
rigid
supervision
officers
will
see
that
music
and
dancing
at
these
places
is
stopped
at
and
that
these
places
do
not
harbor
an
undesirable
element
after
that
i
have
spoken
of
uniformed
men
standing
guard
over
a
roomful
of
citizens
in
new
york
restaurants
and
cabarets
alas
it
is
shockingly
true
it
is
as
though
no
other
law
existed
as
i
have
said
to
one
who
loves
his
country
his
city
it
is
disgusting
the
people
writhe
under
the
presence
of
the
officer
but
do
nothing
about
it
what
can
they
do
could
they
not
request
the
mayor
or
the
police
commissioner
to
stop
such
nonsense
and
if
the
thing
occurs
in
one
restaurant
why
not
in
all
of
them
with
my
own
eyes
i
have
seen
this
petty
exhibition
it
is
outrageous
only
one
officer
was
in
the
place
i
visited
yet
i
could
not
believe
i
was
in
free
america
the
room
was
filled
with
beautifully
dressed
men
and
women
the
dance
floor
was
crowded
upon
every
table
directly
under
the
eye
of
the
officer
was
a
drink
i
am
not
saying
that
in
each
tumbler
there
was
an
alcoholic
beverage
and
probably
the
man
in
uniform
did
not
wish
to
think
so
either
but
i
wonder
how
any
intelligent
being
could
imagine
that
a
lot
of
sophisticated
manhattanites
would
go
out
of
an
evening
to
a
gay
cabaret
and
order
unless
they
intended
to
mix
something
with
it
such
folk
are
not
plain
consumers
as
a
rule
they
purchase
it
to
mingle
with
gin
white
rock
is
not
their
favorite
beverage
neither
is
clysmic
yet
bottles
of
these
were
evident
everywhere
anyone
save
a
moron
would
have
known
why
yet
solemnly
up
and
down
that
room
the
officer
walked
glancing
here
and
there
hobnobbing
now
and
again
with
a
friendly
waiter
who
seemed
to
be
on
excellent
terms
with
him
his
journeys
were
rhythmically
conceived
and
executed
for
a
moment
or
two
he
would
stand
glaring
about
him
his
arms
folded
after
the
manner
of
a
soldier
in
the
late
war
standing
guard
over
military
prisoners
then
he
would
amble
almost
to
the
time
of
the
music
to
the
farther
side
of
the
room
instantly
two
hundred
hands
would
slip
under
the
tables
and
flasks
would
be
drawn
forth
and
a
liquid
that
was
certainly
not
water
would
be
poured
swiftly
and
deftly
into
various
goblets
then
when
the
officer
swung
back
again
on
his
rounds
the
folk
at
the
other
side
of
the
room
would
go
through
the
same
unbelievable
performance
the
man
in
uniform
had
eyes
but
he
saw
not
you
see
the
authorities
had
come
out
with
a
statement
not
long
before
to
the
effect
that
it
was
not
the
man
with
the
whom
they
were
after
only
the
citizen
foolish
and
daring
enough
to
slam
his
flask
down
openly
upon
a
cabaret
table
in
other
words
so
delicate
are
the
nuances
of
the
law
that
it
is
not
an
offense
to
drink
behind
your
napkin
or
behind
a
closed
door
but
it
is
a
very
terrible
crime
to
reveal
the
fact
that
you
have
a
container
of
alcohol
on
your
person
think
of
seriously
pronouncing
such
a
ukase
with
the
law
still
upon
the
records
i
do
not
understand
how
city
magistrates
in
new
york
know
how
to
interpret
the
law
i
was
told
that
almost
every
evening
an
arrest
or
two
is
made
in
these
hitherto
happy
cabarets
but
generally
the
case
is
dismissed
the
proprietor
bails
his
patron
out
and
then
the
starts
again
next
evening
since
this
was
written
the
police
have
been
withdrawn
from
new
york
cabarets
another
confession
of
the
failure
to
enforce
the
law
but
new
york
is
full
of
insincerities
conventions
take
place
there
and
we
read
a
sanctimonious
announcement
in
the
papers
that
of
course
nothing
alcoholic
will
be
served
at
the
banquets
that
goes
without
saying
but
up
in
room
on
the
eighteenth
floor
a
lot
of
men
in
the
city
to
discuss
solemn
business
problems
find
that
sustenance
which
they
desire
and
demand
the
authorities
alarmed
at
the
influx
of
so
many
virtuous
men
give
out
the
statement
that
it
is
well
that
they
so
virtuous
and
not
the
kind
of
fellows
who
crave
a
drink
for
the
hootch
in
new
york
is
notoriously
foul
of
course
it
but
that
makes
no
difference
to
a
prohibition
officer
and
it
would
be
unsafe
to
consume
any
of
it
many
of
these
safe
and
sound
business
men
from
all
parts
of
the
country
came
out
strong
for
the
eighteenth
amendment
they
were
puritans
when
it
came
to
the
other
habits
the
little
clerk
would
never
rise
to
a
position
of
importance
like
theirs
if
he
took
so
much
as
a
glass
of
beer
they
forgot
that
they
in
their
youth
and
ever
since
had
taken
a
daily
nip
i
am
not
saying
that
they
are
any
the
worse
for
it
i
do
know
however
that
they
are
none
the
better
judging
by
their
public
utterances
and
their
private
behavior
if
there
is
one
kind
of
human
animal
i
have
a
supreme
contempt
for
it
is
the
man
who
believes
in
prohibition
for
you
and
me
but
not
for
himself
i
have
heard
bankers
and
wall
street
potentates
hold
forth
with
fervor
on
the
salutary
effects
of
the
volstead
act
since
it
has
forced
the
poor
laboring
man
to
give
up
his
ale
and
beer
he
gets
to
work
early
now
no
need
to
worry
about
monday
morning
in
the
factories
throughout
the
land
there
is
no
debauchery
and
the
bulging
is
taken
home
to
the
wife
and
children
with
no
extractions
on
the
way
at
the
corner
saloon
happiness
reigns
where
penury
and
travail
abided
before
production
is
mounting
there
are
no
strikes
to
speak
of
the
prisons
are
emptying
crime
has
diminished
is
unheard
of
and
so
on
which
would
be
delightful
if
it
were
true
home
brew
goes
rapturously
on
and
if
tim
bother
to
make
it
himself
he
has
a
pal
who
does
and
he
purchases
all
the
gin
and
beer
he
needs
i
am
not
saying
this
with
any
intention
of
approval
i
am
merely
stating
conditions
as
i
have
observed
them
those
who
shut
their
eyes
to
the
facts
and
go
blandly
on
their
way
announcing
that
the
country
is
bone
dry
when
it
is
nothing
of
the
sort
do
immeasurable
damage
i
remember
when
the
volstead
act
first
went
into
effect
that
i
had
a
serious
talk
with
myself
i
came
to
the
conclusion
that
nothing
was
more
dangerous
to
this
land
of
ours
than
a
state
of
things
which
made
it
possible
for
the
rich
to
drink
continuously
and
the
poor
to
be
able
to
obtain
nothing
i
felt
that
i
could
not
with
a
clear
conscience
go
on
having
an
occasional
cocktail
if
the
laboring
man
down
the
street
was
deprived
of
his
grog
for
a
month
i
absolutely
followed
the
whisperings
of
that
inner
voice
then
i
happened
to
go
to
a
manufacturing
town
near
boston
and
the
work
i
was
doing
brought
me
into
contact
with
the
men
in
the
shops
there
somehow
the
subject
came
up
i
forget
in
just
what
way
and
when
my
plan
became
known
a
laugh
greeted
my
ears
be
such
a
jackass
one
of
the
fellows
cried
getting
all
we
want
in
spite
of
volstead
making
it
ourselves
my
martyrdom
ceased
from
that
moment
and
i
must
confess
that
i
felt
a
bit
foolish
more
people
are
drinking
heavily
now
than
in
the
old
days
and
drinking
inferior
stuff
they
are
suffering
more
in
consequence
the
results
of
this
have
been
put
into
a
delightful
rhyme
by
the
clever
james
montague
who
in
his
way
is
a
genius
he
turns
out
happy
and
technically
fine
verses
every
day
for
a
syndicate
until
one
is
amazed
at
his
cleverness
and
seemingly
endless
chain
of
ideas
listen
to
him
elusive
before
there
was
a
volstead
law
the
village
gossips
used
to
mutter
in
pitying
accents
when
they
saw
a
friend
and
neighbor
in
the
gutter
dreadful
was
the
fall
how
terrible
is
his
condition
he
be
that
way
at
all
if
only
we
had
prohibition
they
knew
the
drunkards
all
by
name
and
when
they
came
around
with
edges
some
elderly
and
kindly
dame
would
get
their
signatures
to
pledges
and
if
they
all
appeared
next
day
still
far
too
merry
and
seraphic
the
troubled
townsfolk
used
to
say
hard
things
about
the
liquor
traffic
when
some
good
man
goes
wrong
the
villagers
with
whom
mingled
observe
his
frequent
bursts
of
song
and
thus
discover
he
is
jingled
bad
about
that
chap
they
cry
might
have
kept
his
high
position
if
volstead
made
us
dry
what
ruined
is
prohibition
there
is
some
moral
in
this
tale
i
fancied
so
when
i
designed
it
but
i
have
searched
without
avail
for
nearly
half
an
hour
to
find
it
chapter
vii
a
triumvirate
against
prohibition
how
many
americans
know
that
on
august
abraham
lincoln
with
two
other
men
took
out
a
license
to
sell
liquor
through
the
kindness
of
my
friend
william
fish
i
am
permitted
to
reproduce
it
see
page
times
were
different
then
it
is
true
but
one
has
the
feeling
that
abraham
lincoln
was
not
a
prohibitionist
he
was
temperate
in
all
things
illustration
liquor
license
in
his
amazingly
interesting
book
with
john
leary
includes
a
chapter
wherein
theodore
roosevelt
speaks
in
no
uncertain
manner
about
the
prospect
of
the
country
going
dry
roosevelt
was
not
of
those
who
favored
the
eighteenth
amendment
leary
points
out
his
mind
prohibition
was
certain
to
cause
unrest
and
dissatisfaction
he
doubted
the
fairness
of
removing
the
saloon
without
providing
something
to
take
its
place
in
the
life
of
the
and
he
was
inclined
to
think
the
liquor
question
was
settling
itself
and
i
can
recall
the
time
he
said
to
me
one
day
it
was
not
bad
form
for
substantial
men
of
affairs
for
lawyers
doctors
professional
men
generally
to
drink
in
the
middle
of
the
day
it
is
good
form
no
longer
and
not
now
done
it
is
not
so
long
ago
that
practically
every
man
in
politics
drank
more
or
less
when
hard
drinking
if
not
the
rule
was
not
the
exception
now
the
hard
drinker
if
he
exists
at
all
among
the
higher
grade
is
a
survival
of
what
you
might
call
another
day
tammany
no
one
holds
that
up
as
an
organization
of
model
men
yet
i
am
sure
that
were
you
to
make
a
canvass
of
its
district
leaders
you
would
find
pretty
close
to
a
majority
if
not
an
actual
majority
are
teetotallers
tammany
no
longer
sends
men
with
ability
and
a
weakness
for
liquor
to
albany
it
may
and
it
probably
will
send
another
of
tom
ability
but
it
will
not
send
one
who
drinks
as
hard
you
may
rest
assured
is
not
a
matter
of
morals
it
is
however
a
matter
of
efficiency
tammany
wants
results
and
it
is
sufficiently
abreast
of
the
times
to
know
that
drink
and
efficiency
do
not
go
hand
in
hand
in
these
days
of
card
indexes
and
adding
machines
is
the
same
in
your
profession
not
long
ago
most
of
the
boys
were
fairly
competent
drinking
men
some
i
knew
were
rated
as
extra
competent
by
admiring
perhaps
envious
colleagues
now
the
drinking
man
at
least
the
man
who
drinks
enough
to
show
the
effects
is
rare
the
reason
your
editors
stand
for
it
as
jack
slaght
put
it
the
other
day
i
think
it
was
jack
a
reporter
in
the
old
days
was
expected
to
have
about
so
often
and
nothing
was
thought
of
it
now
as
slaght
puts
it
he
is
allowed
but
two
the
first
time
still
quoting
your
friend
slaght
who
at
times
is
inclined
to
use
plain
language
he
gets
hell
the
next
time
he
gets
fired
that
is
so
is
it
not
assured
him
that
slaght
was
substantially
correct
not
a
matter
of
morals
there
with
a
laugh
will
admit
you
boys
do
not
lack
morals
as
with
tammany
it
is
a
question
of
getting
results
exactly
as
it
is
with
the
doctor
the
lawyer
and
the
judge
declined
once
it
became
an
economic
question
or
at
least
as
soon
as
it
was
recognized
as
an
economic
factor
it
then
began
to
be
unfashionable
at
least
to
overdrink
and
the
man
who
never
drank
at
all
ceased
to
be
unusual
in
any
trade
or
calling
am
however
sorry
that
they
are
pressing
prohibition
so
hard
at
this
time
it
is
i
think
all
right
desirable
in
fact
to
limit
or
perhaps
prohibit
the
hard
liquors
but
it
is
a
mistake
i
think
to
stop
or
try
to
stop
the
use
of
beers
and
the
lighter
wines
this
thing
goes
through
where
does
the
social
side
of
life
come
in
we
both
know
that
a
dinner
is
apt
to
be
a
sad
sort
of
affair
it
will
make
dining
a
lost
art
i
do
not
know
how
the
will
take
to
the
change
you
and
i
have
no
need
of
the
saloon
we
have
other
places
to
go
but
you
and
i
know
that
the
saloon
fits
into
a
very
definite
place
in
the
life
of
the
i
do
not
know
what
he
will
do
without
it
what
substitutes
the
reformers
will
think
they
can
give
him
for
it
i
do
not
believe
they
have
thought
of
that
or
that
they
care
much
i
do
not
know
what
will
be
the
outcome
prohibition
if
it
comes
will
cause
and
unrest
it
will
be
a
disturbing
factor
but
i
do
not
look
for
anything
serious
for
after
all
is
said
and
done
the
fact
remains
that
the
american
workman
is
a
individual
it
comes
prohibition
may
or
may
not
be
permanent
you
may
however
be
sure
of
one
thing
it
will
be
extremely
difficult
to
repeal
once
it
becomes
part
of
the
for
prohibition
colonel
roosevelt
placed
squarely
upon
the
shoulders
of
the
liquor
dealers
good
and
bad
liquor
dealers
i
have
known
said
he
good
citizens
who
kept
decent
places
take
the
oakeses
father
and
son
who
own
the
oyster
bay
inn
i
should
be
very
sorry
to
see
them
lose
their
license
theirs
is
a
clean
respectable
place
again
there
is
john
place
in
new
york
no
one
ever
heard
a
complaint
against
john
his
place
has
been
no
more
offensive
than
if
he
sold
dry
goods
shall
take
no
part
in
the
contest
one
way
or
the
other
it
must
be
settled
without
me
i
shall
not
allow
it
or
anything
else
to
swerve
me
from
the
work
now
now
was
the
effort
to
speed
up
the
war
by
arousing
the
american
people
to
the
necessity
of
winning

woodrow

vetoed
the
volstead
act
he
saw
at
once
its
undemocratic
features
its
danger
to
the
country
as
to
following
abraham
lincoln
theodore
roosevelt
and
woodrow
wilson
do
you
prefer
their
leadership
or
that
of
volstead
and
the
fanatics
chapter
viii
fear
for
thee
my
the
prohibitionists
contend
when
we
who
are
but
human
suggest
that
the
eighteenth
amendment
and
the
volstead
act
should
be
changed
that
the
law
is
the
law
and
now
that
these
are
part
of
our
statutes
they
are
there
to
stay
that
they
must
not
be
tampered
with
or
altered
in
any
way
that
it
is
up
to
every
good
american
to
accept
them
not
to
complain
not
to
make
any
utterance
which
would
be
apt
to
disturb
the
sweet
peace
these
laws
are
intended
to
bring
to
us
they
forget
that
it
is
they
themselves
who
saw
fit
to
change
our
laws
are
they
bad
americans
because
they
did
so
when
the
shoe
is
on
the
other
foot
but
the
analogy
is
so
obvious
that
there
can
scarcely
be
any
necessity
of
arguing
the
matter
i
have
written
in
a
previous
chapter
about
a
few
of
the
laws
which
are
disobeyed
am
i
a
bad
american
a
poor
sport
for
instance
because
i
refuse
to
believe
in
capital
punishment
it
is
the
law
of
my
state
that
a
man
found
guilty
of
murder
in
the
first
degree
must
go
to
the
electric
chair
called
to
serve
upon
a
criminal
jury
i
plainly
say
that
i
do
not
believe
in
capital
punishment
i
am
excused
my
conscientious
scruples
are
taken
into
consideration
i
imagine
that
only
a
small
percentage
of
us
believe
in
sending
a
man
to
his
death
even
for
so
serious
a
crime
as
murder
yet
the
statute
abides
we
continue
to
send
men
to
the
gallows
or
the
chair
though
some
states
have
been
wise
enough
to
abolish
the
barbarous
habit
i
have
conscientious
scruples
about
trying
a
man
for
violation
of
the
volstead
act
for
it
would
hardly
be
possible
for
me
to
convict
a
fellow
citizen
who
had
been
spied
upon
by
a
detective
in
a
as
i
read
not
long
ago
that
one
man
had
been
i
am
against
the
manner
in
which
evidence
is
obtained
and
i
would
distrust
even
under
oath
statements
of
witnesses
who
hired
themselves
to
the
government
as
men
to
visit
beaches
and
bathing
pavilions
in
order
to
discover
some
unlucky
devil
in
the
act
of
taking
a
nip
from
a
pint
bottle
after
he
was
shivering
from
his
plunge
in
the
ocean
there
is
a
human
element
in
such
a
case
i
may
be
too
emotional
for
perfect
jury
service
granted
but
that
is
something
beyond
my
control
i
can
not
change
my
temperament
i
loath
the
spectacle
of
one
part
of
the
population
striving
to
discover
something
evil
in
the
other
part
it
seems
unnecessary
to
me
peeping
toms
are
a
far
greater
menace
than
the
people
peeped
at
i
do
not
feel
morally
bound
to
respect
a
law
which
so
many
respectable
fellow
citizens
likewise
disrespect
i
think
stupid
legislation
is
an
abomination
that
the
world
would
be
a
happier
place
were
it
not
for
censorship
of
morals
and
manners
i
think
that
most
people
instinctively
know
the
difference
between
right
and
wrong
and
that
through
education
they
can
be
made
to
understand
and
see
all
those
little
differences
and
shades
which
sometimes
confound
us
there
are
divorce
laws
upon
our
statutes
which
millions
of
people
violently
and
bitterly
oppose
is
a
good
roman
catholic
a
bad
american
citizen
because
his
conscience
refuses
to
let
him
condone
the
rulings
of
our
courts
in
divorce
trials
on
april
in
protestant
episcopal
church
emmerton
maryland
a
sermon
was
preached
by
the
reverend
on
the
subject
of
a
disreputable
the
minister
took
as
his
text
the
verses
from
esther
and
they
gave
them
drink
in
vessels
of
gold
the
vessels
being
diverse
one
from
another
and
royal
wine
in
abundance
according
to
the
state
of
the
king
and
the
drinking
was
according
to
the
law
none
did
compel
for
so
the
king
had
appointed
to
all
the
officers
of
his
house
that
they
should
do
according
to
every
he
said
in
part
president
harding
and
secretary
hughes
have
made
pathetic
appeals
to
the
people
of
america
to
respect
the
law
that
such
a
request
should
have
been
considered
necessary
is
itself
a
sad
commentary
on
the
state
of
affairs
existing
in
our
republic
there
is
a
difference
between
obedience
and
respect
all
good
citizens
are
called
upon
to
obey
the
laws
whether
they
respect
a
particular
law
or
not
but
they
are
not
called
upon
to
respect
a
law
that
is
not
respectable
are
disreputable
laws
just
as
there
are
disreputable
men
is
a
man
properly
looked
upon
as
disreputable
that
depends
on
the
time
and
place
and
the
people
who
do
the
looking
but
in
most
ages
and
countries
there
are
some
things
that
the
universal
conscience
of
man
holds
to
be
not
respectable
thus
lying
robbing
cruelty
and
blasphemy
are
disreputable
and
a
man
who
lies
robs
is
cruel
and
blasphemes
is
a
disreputable
man
if
a
law
can
be
shown
to
lie
to
rob
to
be
cruel
and
to
blaspheme
god
it
is
a
disreputable
law
and
does
not
deserve
respect
though
all
good
citizens
should
obey
it
until
it
is
repealed
call
upon
the
people
of
america
to
respect
a
law
that
is
not
respectable
is
fundamentally
dishonest
for
it
breaks
down
the
distinction
between
what
is
respectable
and
what
is
disreputable
and
calls
upon
us
to
admire
and
look
up
to
that
which
we
should
despise
and
abhor
i
will
give
you
reasons
why
i
consider
that
the
volstead
act
lies
robs
is
cruel
and
blasphemes
god
it
may
be
that
my
arguments
are
not
sound
but
they
appear
to
me
to
be
so
and
all
that
a
man
can
do
is
to
go
according
to
his
conscience
and
his
common
sense
seems
to
me
that
it
is
a
lie
to
say
that
all
beverages
containing
more
than
one
half
of
one
per
cent
of
alcohol
are
intoxicating
no
stomach
can
hold
enough
of
a
drink
containing
twice
that
proportion
of
alcohol
to
become
inebriated
thereby
it
is
a
physical
impossibility
he
would
have
to
absorb
at
least
a
gallon
at
one
time
to
do
it
volstead
act
robbed
thousands
of
men
whose
capital
was
invested
in
what
they
considered
to
be
an
honorable
industry
and
one
that
promoted
the
health
and
happiness
of
mankind
on
the
whole
even
though
five
per
cent
injured
themselves
by
it
robbed
them
by
taking
away
their
property
from
them
without
compensation
it
robbed
their
employees
of
their
living
by
throwing
them
out
of
work
it
robbed
the
taxpayers
who
now
have
to
pay
out
of
their
own
pockets
by
compulsion
the
billions
of
dollars
that
were
formerly
spent
cheerfully
and
voluntarily
by
the
users
of
alcoholic
beverages
volstead
act
is
cruel
to
invalids
who
under
it
can
not
afford
to
get
the
proper
alcoholic
beverages
needed
to
preserve
their
lives
i
could
quote
scores
of

prove
this

of

which
had
about
three
years
in

i
must
confess
to
being
somewhat
disconcerted
and
disheartened
at
first
by
the
total
the
excessive
drinkers
were
far
healthier
than
the

as

were

the

done
to
these

men
by
occasional
sprees
is
not
so
great
as
the
damage
done
by
the
climate
to

what
a

have

that
they
would

an
advantage
to

they
would

rather
see

than
let
them

that
a

of

at
meals
might
save

he
had
stated
that
approximately
per

of

died
while
about
per

of

less
than

about

were
invalided

about
per

or
per

of
the
moderate
and
about
per
cent
of
the
excessive
drinkers
yet
in
the
light
of
stupendous
facts
like
these
the
volstead
act
is
passed
hampering
physicians
in
their
work
of
mercy
and
making
it
sometimes
impossible
for
them
to
give
the
remedies
that
god
intended
to
prevent
suffering
and
preserve
human
life
could
diabolical
cruelty
go
further
than
that
torture
an
invalid
is
as
devilish
as
it
is
to
burn
a
well
man
at
a

it
is
a
thousand
times
worse
because
it
is
so
much
more

hundreds
of

are
being
tortured
all
over

for
every
white
man
that
ever
was
burned
at
the
stake
by
the
indians
loyal
member
of
the
protestant
episcopal
church
should
hold
that
the
volstead
act
is
a
blasphemy
against
god
jews
unitarians
and
others
who
do
not
consider
that
jesus
was
god
are
entitled
to
hold
different
views
from
us
regarding
the
religious
aspect
of
this
act
but
for
us
there
is
no
escape
we
believe
that
jesus
was
god
and
we
believe
that
he
made
wine
at
cana
and
that
he
ordered
it
to
be
drunk
publicly
in
his
memory
for
all
time
to
come
our
church
has
declared
that
unfermented
grape
juice
is
not
wine
and
should
not
be
used
for
it
in
the
sacrament
of
holy
communion
a
law
to
say
that
wine
containing
more
than
one
half
of
one
per
cent
alcohol
should
not
be
allowed
to
be
made
and
carried
about
freely
from
place
to
place
implies
that
jesus
did
wrong
in
making
it
and
ordering
it
to
be
used
publicly
by
christians
if
he
did
wrong
he
was
not
god
therefore
the
volstead
act
from
the
standpoint
of
our
church
blasphemes
god
true
churchman
consequently
should
despise
and
abhor
the
volstead
act
as
lying
robbing
cruel
and
blaspheming
and
unworthy
of
respect
although
it
must
be
obeyed
by
all
good
citizens
till
it
can
be
repealed
we
give
it
obedience
but
not
respect
some
will
say
this
is
so
why
should
we
obey
such
a
law
would
it
not
be
better
to
rebel
against
it
to
flout
it
openly
and
take
the
consequences
it
is
unjust
it
is
tyrannical
it
is
it
is
due
to
a
combination
of
religious
and
universal
ignorance
of
physiology
it
is
the
result
of
active
political
propaganda
carried
on
by
money
of
persons
who
are
financially
interested
in
prohibiting
alcoholic
beverages
the
weapons
used
have
been
trickery
deception
falsification
of
statistics
lobbying
slander
and
abuse
it
has
been
forced
on
legislators
by
intimidation
of
the
grossest
kind
good
men
have
been
afraid
to
oppose
it
for
fear
of
being
called
lawbreakers
and
other
opprobrious
epithets
it
was
smuggled
in
as
a
war
measure
when
our
young
men
were
overseas
and
later
on
was
made
more
and
more
stringent
till
it
far
surpassed
in
tyranny
any
thought
entertained
by
its
supporters
in
the
beginning
why
should
we
obey
such
a
law
would
it
not
be
more
american
to
treat
this
piece
of
iniquity
as
our
forefathers
treated
the
stamp
act
it
is
our
duty
to
obey
it
we
could
not
repeal
the
stamp
act
and
we
can
repeal
this
in
the
case
of
the
tyranny
of
george
iii
there
was
no
legal
redress
all
that
men
could
do
was
to
rebel
that
tyranny
was
forced
on
us
from
the
outside
this
we
have
allowed
to
be
imposed
on
us
in
our
supineness
by
tyrants
in
our
own
household
the
two
cases
are
not
similar
we
must
obey
the
volstead
act
till
we
can
repeal
or
amend
it
declared
is
to
the
collective
body
what
health
is
to
every
individual
body
without
health
no
pleasure
can
be
tasted
by
man
without
liberty
no
happiness
can
be
enjoyed
by
refuse
to
be
silent
when
i
see
america
the
hope
of
mankind
likely
to
be
bound
hand
and
foot
by
the
tyranny
of
ignorance
and
religious
fanaticism
maxim
of
john
philpot
curran
vigilance
is
the
price
of
liberty
was
never
needed
in
america
more
than
it
is
at
this
moment
this
is
no
time
for
patriots
to
be
silent
to
burke
the
people
never
give
up
their
liberties
but
under
some
delusion
in
this
case
the
delusion
is
that
they
are
following
christ
while
they
are
really
following
mahomet
the
that
delusion
must
be
exposed
until
everybody
sees
it
clearly
must
not
forget
what
colton
said
will
not
descend
to
a
people
a
people
must
raise
themselves
to
liberty
it
is
a
blessing
that
must
be
earned
to
be
can
this
be
done
listen
to
savonarola
you
wish
to
be
free
then
above
all
things
love
god
love
one
another
and
love
the
common
weal
then
you
will
have
is
all
right
to
regulate
drinking
by
law
provided
it
is
the
right
kind
of
a
law
extraordinary
thing
about
our
text
is
that
it
shows
the
legal
regulation
of
drinking
to
be
no
new
thing
for
it
existed
in
the
time
of
queen
esther
or
just
years
ago
because
our
text
says
the
drinking
was
according
to
the
the
law
allowed
all
the
liberty
that
was
right
and
proper
it
says
could
compel
for
the
king
had
appointed
to
all
the
officers
of
his
house
that
they
should
do
according
to
every
was
a
joyful
and
festive
occasion
like
the
wedding
at
cana
and
ahasuerus
then
as
did
jesus
later
on
recognizes
that
the
proper
use
of
wine
would
promote
happiness
and
health
and
that
the
guests
present
would
be
trusted
not
to
abuse
it
though
laws
regulating
drinking
may
be
necessary
to
well
ordered
society
these
laws
must
be
equitable
and
sensible
regulation
according
to
the
scriptures
not
prohibition
the
drinking
should
be
to
the
one
great
trouble
about
the
volstead
act
is
that
the
drinking
goes
on
just
the
same
but
it
is
not
to
the
law
and
instead
of
getting
pure
liquors
people
are
being
poisoned
by
the
thousands
all
over
the
country
it
not
be
better
to
follow
the
bible
and
have
the
liquor
drunk
according
to
the
law
can
only
be
done
by
modifying
the
law
so
as
to
make
it
conform
with
the
bible
if
the
law
is
dishonest
cruel
or
unjust
we
must
vote
to
change
it
if
we
love
god
and
love
our
neighbor
and
love
the
common
weal
we
must
either
repeal
it
altogether
or
amend
it
so
as
to
make
it
honest
kindly
and
fair
so
that
we
may
have
law
and
liberty
at
the
same
time
americans
will
do
it
in
the
immortal
words
of
daniel
webster
the
true
spark
of
religious
and
civil
liberty
be
kindled
it
will
burn
human
agency
can
not
extinguish
it
like
the
central
fire
it
may
be
smothered
for
a
time
the
ocean
may
overwhelm
it
mountains
may
press
it
down
but
its
inherent
and
unconquerable
force
will
heave
both
the
ocean
and
the
land
and
at
some
time
or
other
in
some
place
or
other
it
will
break
out
and
flame
up
to
this
is
powerful
language
which
strikes
at
the
very
root
of
things
but
is
not
the
only
fearless
clergyman
who
has
spoken
his
mind
on
this
question
archbishop
glennon
of
louis
has
scored
the
eighteenth
amendment
in
an
interview
given
at
atlantic
city
in
august
he
bravely
said
constitution
has
been
considerably
weakened
by
the
addition
of
the
eighteenth
amendment
for
the
prohibition
clause
limits
rights
while
the
rest
of
the
constitution
grants
rights
matters
referring
to
alcohol
and
drugs
should
be
left
to
the
police
courts
of
the
various
cities
and
when
he
was
asked
if
he
thought
prohibition
a
benefit
to
the
country
he
said
those
who
drink
too
much
the
most
reverend
james
duhig
archbishop
of
brisbane
australia
interviewed
in
new
york
in
the
late
summer
of
deplored
the
dry
law
he
admitted
that
he
had
not
observed
any
drunken
men
in
the
streets
of
the
metropolis
but
that
fact
he
said
was
beside
the
issue
because
it
was
the
principle
of
prohibition
with
which
he
took
issue
he
said
australia
they
are
against
prohibition
i
myself
have
written
strongly
against
it
and
all
that
i
have
been
able
to
learn
of
the
results
of
it
in
the
united
states
has
only
served
to
confirm
my
belief
that
australia
has
taken
the
right
view
was
amazed
at
america
going
dry
you
can
not
make
men
sober
by
an
act
of
parliament
what
we
need
is
a
reasonable
control
of
the
liquor
trade
not
its
total
abolition
extremes
are
always
dangerous
and
i
consider
prohibition
an
extreme
in
the
state
of
nebraska
recently
an
attempt
was
made
to
put
through
the
legislation
many
autocratic
laws
people
were
not
to
be
allowed
to
speak
a
foreign
language
and
certain
restrictions
were
to
be
placed
on
the
wearing
of
religious
garb
etc
a
visitor
to
that
state
george
schreiner
of
south
africa
deprecated
such
legislation
and
stated
that
of
intolerance
defeat
their
own
it
is
interesting
to
see
the
reactions
on
those
who

schreiner
expressed
himself
wisely
when
he
said
all
reminds
me
of
the
attempt
recently
made
in
japan
to
put
a
law
on
the
statutes
against
bad
thoughts
of
course
that
was
very
absurd
and
still
in
a
way
it
was
a
very
honestly
meant
piece
of
legislation
the
author
of
the
bill
wanted
to
get
at
the
root
of
what
he
considered
an
evil
a
danger
to
japan
elsewhere
and
in
your
own
state
the
same
thing
has
been
attempted
by
being
aimed
at
as
it
were
i
feel
that
a
great
deal
of
intolerance
has
been
born
of
the
war
but
we
ought
to
be
fair
even
with
jupiter
and
mars
much
is
blamed
on
the
war
when
in
reality
the
war
served
simply
as
an
excuse
to
waken
latent
passions
in
which
is
certainly
a
sane
periodical
whose
editorial
integrity
can
not
be
doubted
sees
a
menace
in
too
much
legislation
only
confusion
and
distrust
can
result
when
the
people
are
confronted
with
a
mass
of
judicial
arguments
and
interpretations
of
those
arguments
in
a
sensible
editorial
recently
entitled
not
of
the
editors
spoke
their
minds
thus
harassed
old
world
needs
of
as
well
as
of
statutes
laws
and
regulations
of
all
sorts
make
each
year
confusion
worse
confounded
it
has
been
asserted
that
every
person
in
the
united
states
unwittingly
in
cases
out
of
violates
every
day
some
federal
state
or
local
law
or

perhaps
the

in
going
from
his
home
to
the
court

where
he
hands
down
every
day
his
judgments

justice
breaks
some
minor
regulation
for
which
offense
a
policeman
if
he
were
nearby
and
had
studied
his
book
of
regulations
carefully
enough
could
place
the
eminent

administration
recently
estimated
that
the
average
policeman
to
enforce
the
city
ordinances
state
laws
and
congressional
enactments
committed
in
whole
or
in
part
to
his
charge
must
have
a
working
knowledge
of
at
least
statutes
this
fact
was
pointed
out
in
a
recent
speech
in
washington
by
james
emery
before
the
american
cotton
association
not
a
congress
sometime
which
would
subtract
useless
or
foolish
or
annoying
laws
from
the
instead
of
adding
laws
to
those
same
bulky
volumes
such
a
congress
might
earn
recognition
as
the
greatest
the
world
had
yet
seen
one
of
our
state
legislators
a
few
years
ago
an
extreme
illustration
occurred
of
the
desire
of
a
member
to
have
his
name
attached
to
some
piece
of
legislation
this
particular
member
was
sent
to
the
legislature
from
a
more
or
less
rural
district
he
introduced
a
bill
providing
that
a
bounty
of
five
dollars
be
paid
by
the
state
for
the
hide
of
every
the
canada
lynx
or
wild
cat
killed
in
the
commonwealth
most
of
the
members
did
not
know
what
a
was
and
had
to
consult
the
dictionary
or
some
other
member
who
had
beaten
them
to
the
dictionary
to
find
out
what
this
particular
animal
popularly
known
in
some
places
as
lucy
vee
was
the
legislator
who
desired
to
have
his
name
go
down
in
history
as
the
author
of
an
addition
to
the
laws
of
the
state
is
said
to
have
traded
his
vote
on
practically
every
other
piece
of
legislation
which
came
up
at
that
session
for
votes
on
his
pet
measure
which
was
passed
the
state
pays
as
much
as
twenty
or
thirty
dollars
some
years
for
the
animals
killed
on
which
this
bill
offered
a
bounty
there
is
one
place
above
all
others
where
there
is
pride
of
authorship
it
is
in
the
halls
of
state
and
national
capitols
and
as
in
the
field
of
there
is
plenty
of
plagiarism
similar
bills
also
are
frequently
introduced
by
a
half
dozen
or
more
members
each
hoping
his
may
be
the
one
which
will
stick
and
bear
the
mark
of
fame
united
states
holds
first
place
in
the
manufacture
of
statutory
law
declared
emery
in
his
speech
single
congress
he
added
receives
some
bills
many
of
the
states
consider
not
less
than
during
the
year
legislatures
were
in
session
judging
from
past
years
congress
and
the
states
annually
enact
an
average
of
statutes
the
state
and
national
legislation
of
a
single
year
recently
required
more
than
pages
of
official
it
is
time
for
a
congress
on
limitation
of
the
same
paper
has
this
to
say
editorially
on
achilles
heel
of
prohibition
has
not
been
long
on
trial
the
final
effect
of
the
fundamental
change
in
our
constitution
involved
in
the
enactment
of
the
eighteenth
amendment
has
not
been
and
can
not
be
yet
determined
all
the
evidence
which
we
have
seen
however
tends
to
show
that
the
nation
is
better
off
materially
and
physically
under
prohibition
than
under
the
system
which
permitted
the
sale
of
intoxicating
beverages
benefits
to
be
derived
from
the
elimination
of
the
drink
traffic
did
not
wait
upon
our
national
experiment
for
demonstration
they
have
been
obvious
for
centuries
in
the
experience
of
peoples
from
whom
alcohol
has
been
barred
by
religious
authority
there
remains
however
a
very
serious
problem
confronting
the
defenders
and
advocates
of
national
prohibition
it
is
the
problem
of
maintaining
the
respect
for
law
and
order
and
that
mental
habit
of
ready
acceptance
of
legal
enactments
which
is
one
of
the
strongest
bulwarks
of
applied
democracy
do
not
doubt
for
a
minute
that
the
majority
of
the
people
of
the
united
states
are
in
favor
of
national
prohibition
even
in
great
cities
where
the
liquor
interests
have
had
their
stronghold
we
suspect
that
the
number
of
men
and
women
who
would
vote
for
national
prohibition
were
it
put
to
the
popular
test
is
much
larger
than
the
are
willing
to
admit
we
say
this
in
order
that
this
editorial
may
not
be
considered
as
an
argument
for
the
repeal
of
prohibition
amendment
by
those
who
are
working
for
such
ends
upon
premises
which
we
regard
as
distinctly
unsound
say
that
there
is
a
majority
in
favor
of
the
amendment
does
not
imply
that
there
is
not
a
large
and
active
minority
in
favor
of
its
repeal
the
greatest
problem
confronting
advocates
of
national
prohibition
lies
in
the
fact
that
this
large
minority
has
not
accepted
the
amendment
with
that
good
faith
and
willing
spirit
which
we
have
grown
to
look
upon
as
characteristic
of
the
spirit
of
the
losers
in
our
political
controversies
there
have
been
great
changes
in
our
government
prior
to
the
enactment
of
the
prohibition
amendment
but
almost
invariably
these
changes
once
effected
have
been
acquiesced
in
by
their
most
ardent
opponents
we
are
not
speaking
of
individual
violators
but
of
the
public
attitude
towards
the
law
of
the
strongest
denunciations
of
those
who
have
failed
to
acquiesce
in
the
eighteenth
amendment
was
recently
voiced
by
judge
ben
lindsay
of
colorado
in
a
statement
to
the
press
judge
lindsay
said
the
eighteenth
amendment
going
to
be
enforced
at
the
present
time
it
is
not
being
enforced
with
any
degree
of
success
but
has
raised
up
a
trail
of
evils
in
its
wake
which
are
as
bad
if
not
worse
than
those
it
sought
to
avoid
far
the
great
majority
of
prosecutions
have
been
against
the
poor
and
uninfluential
people
who
are
victims
of
the
tremendous
temptations
afforded
by
the
example
of
the
rich
what
do
i
mean
i
mean
that
the
wealthy
and
more
favored
class
in
this
country
must
accept
a
responsibility
which
is
now
being
ignored
they
must
be
willing
to
give
up
their
pleasures
and
abide
by
the
law
intended
for
the
good
of
all
so
far
they
have
not
set
the
example
theaters
jokesters
and
parodists
are
encouraged
in
making
a
mockery
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
when
a
rich
or
influential
citizen
fills
his
cellars
with
smuggled
liquor
and
the
police
are
called
off
in
nearly
every
case
the
of
the
is
immediately
set
in
motion
what
is
this
consists
of
their
influence
in
reaching
officials
and
suppressing
newspaper
publicity
concerning
themselves
so
long
as
some
of
these
officials
and
some
newspapers
are
lending
themselves
to
this
they
are
creating
class
prejudice
an
example
of
this
occurred
in
our
city
within
the
past
week
a
friend
of
one
of
our
most
influential
newspapers
became
involved
in
a
bootlegging
case
and
was
successful
in
suppressing
all
mention
of
it
in
that
particular
paper
which
pretends
to
be
against
this
evil
greatest
need
in
this
country
is
to
abolish
privileges
and
the
new
which
the
eighteenth
amendment
has
created
is
the
right
of
the
rich
to
have
their
booze
while
the
same
right
is
denied
to
the
lindsay
has
laid
his
finger
upon
a
moral
danger
which
exists
in
the
widespread
levity
towards
an
important
section
of
our
national
constitution
the
same
menace
was
singled
out
for
warning
by
prohibition
commissioner
haynes
when
he
recently
said
of
the
greatest
dangers
now
confronting
the
republic
is
that
we
may
lose
our
vision
of
the
sanctity
and
majesty
of
the
shall
we
guard
ourselves
against
this
menace
the
protection
can
not
be
found
merely
in
increased
activity
of
the
enforcement
officials
it
can
not
be
wholly
met
by
the
vigilance
of
the
police
it
is
a
moral
danger
and
it
must
be
met
with
moral
weapons
we
turn
to
the
states
which
experimented
with
prohibition
prior
to
the
enactment
of
the
national
amendment
we
shall
find
precedent
an
uncertain
guide
to
an
understanding
of
the
situation
which
confronts
us
maine
which
has
the
longest
record
under
prohibition
has
almost
the
poorest
record
in
maintaining
respect
for
its
prohibition
laws
kansas
on
the
other
hand
after
a
generation
of
disturbance
and
conflict
settled
down
to
obedience
to
the
law
backed
by
a
wholesome
and
widespread
public
opinion
the
nation
follow
the
precedence
of
maine
or
of
kansas
the
determination
of
this
fact
depends
on
the
sum
total
of
the
attitude
of
our
individual
citizens
towards
the
maintenance
of
our
fundamental
law
it
is
the
right
of
any
one
to
work
for
the
repeal
of
the
eighteenth
amendment
if
he
or
she
so
desires
but
it
is
the
bounden
duty
of
every
one
to
see
that
so
long
as
the
eighteenth
amendment
is
part
of
our
constitution
it
is
accorded
that
respect
upon
which
the
whole
structure
of
democratic
government
but
here
we
get
right
back
to
where
we
started
citizens
can
not
be
to
respect
a
law
for
which
inwardly
they
have
a
great
contempt
even
a
spiritual
energy
can
not
be
brought
to
bear
i
fear
which
is
strong
enough
to
bring
about
this
desirable
end
the
youth
of
our
land
at
least
in
our
great
cities
laugh
at
the
eighteenth
amendment
which
means
that
they
will
laugh
at
other
laws
and
finally
express
nothing
but
derision
for
the
government
this
concentrated
feeling
is
far
more
serious
than
scattered
inebriety
it
strikes
at
the
very
base
and
roots
of
society
and
once
having
gained
a
sure
hold
on
the
people
can
not
be
checked
an
observer
who
loves
america
can
not
but
see
in
the
youth
of
the
land
a
total
disrespect
for
order
and
the
old
sanctities
a
violation
of
moral
codes
and
a
failure
to
establish
rectitude
in
niches
of
the
heart
there
are
no
convictions
no
principles
among
the
young
and
growing
population
there
is
no
desire
to
conform
no
aspiration
for
a
betterment
of
conditions
as
they
are
instead
there
is
intolerant
laughter
and
one
is
called
an
old
fogy
who
attempts
to
assert
that
marriage
vows
mean
something
and
that
girls
who
drink
cocktails
in
taxicabs
out
of
thermos
bottles
are
in
grave
peril
there
is
a
studious
avoidance
of
responsibility
yet
one
should
not
be
surprised
the
example
set
is
none
too
worthy
it
is
known
that
hypocrisy
exists
in
high
places
that
inconsistency
is
a
national
trait
that
men
in
office
say
one
thing
and
do
another
i
heard
a
young
man
remark
not
long
ago
they
think
wrong
do
they
to
drink
well
how
many
congressmen
in
washington
have
replenished
their
do
you
suppose
since
volstead
ran
this
country
eh
like
to
get
affidavits
from
bootleggers
in
washington
as
to
just
what
stock
has
been
laid
that
feeling
how
can
one
counteract
it
one
has
no
answer
for
such
a
sage
youth
alas
he
does
some
thinking
after
all
but
our
silly
legislation
has
caused
his
thoughts
to
run
in
a
direction
from
which
we
would
gladly
divert
his
mind
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
most
of
his
elders
have
thought
long
and
solemnly
on
these
same
things
it
is
not
a
pretty
topic
to
consider
we
will
not
face
the
facts
that
is
the
trouble
with
america
as
i
see
it
i
know
one
assemblyman
in
new
york
state
who
bravely
ran
on
a
wet
platform
in
a
dry
community
as
a
matter
of
principle
he
was
weary
of
lying
to
himself
and
to
his
constituents
he
said
that
as
long
as
he
kept
a
and
deliberately
transported
some
of
its
contents
when
it
suited
him
in
his
car
he
could
not
face
his
friends
he
must
come
out
in
the
open
and
accept
their
blame
or
their
approval
he
ran
for
office
with
a
clear
conscience
but
others
will
not
thus
declare
themselves
behind
veils
of
verbiage
they
discreetly
conceal
their
political
faces
alone
with
one
another
or
with
you
and
me
they
will
speak
their
true
mind
on
prohibition
particularly
if
their
tongues
are
loosened
by
one
or
two
glasses
of
whiskey
these
are
the
men
who
are
a
danger
to
the
republic
they
pretend
to
serve
have
they
they
are
all
things
to
all
men
the
time
will
come
when
before
we
go
to
the
polls
we
shall
know
just
where
each
candidate
stands
on
every
issue
there
will
be
no
equivocation
declarations
must
be
made
masks
must
be
off
of
the
menace
of
hypocritical
and
senators
edwin
markham
has
spoken
eloquently
in
these
ringing
lines
they
should
be
known
to
us
all
in
these
times
of
shattered
dreams
and
false
avowals
the
old
established
ship
of

weather

if
the

remained

literally
in
the
gutter
now
look
at
him
as
he
sits
in
the
merry
sunshine
on
the
porch
of
the
whittling
his
life
away
where
aforetime
he
drank
it
away
they
do
not
know
that
the
poor
devil
is
about
the
only
person
in
the
village
except
themselves
who
fails
to
obtain
whiskey
though
his
reasons
for
the
lack
are
hardly
similar
to
theirs
he
simply
can
not
afford
the
price
it
costs
a
few
pennies
to
get
to
that
neighboring
wet
village
and
after
one
is
there
it
costs
a
little
more
to
procure
the
stuff
he
once
drank
with
such
avidity
but
the
flappers
oh
yes
they
have
them
even
in
wyoming
small
towns
and
the
boys
who
are
their
friends
can
dash
over
in
a
ford
and
get
all
they
want
concealed
on
the
hip
they
feel
no
lack
of
stimulation
when
the
evening
shadows
fall
they
do
not
get
tight
in
public
as
the
town
drunkard
used
to
do
not
at
all
but
they
are
up
to
all
the
tricks
of
sly
drinking
if
they
were
burglars
they
would
be
called
america
has
taught
them
a
thing
or
two
and
where
the
previous
generation
at
their
age
never
dreamed
of
taking
a
cocktail
they
think
of
nothing
else
and
will
get
it
at
any
price
this
is
true
the
country
over
but
the
obviously
enforced
reformation
of
many
a
village
souse
is
pointed
to
as
perfect
evidence
that
all
is
well
i
suppose
those
virtuous
ladies
go
to
bed
nights
and
sleep
serenely
happy
in
the
consciousness
that
they
have
helped
the
race
and
even
as
they
slumber
are
opened
corks
are
popping
and
an
enjoyable
time
is
being
had
by
all
thus
do
reformers
blind
themselves
to
conditions
as
they
are
the
village
drunkard
tottering
to
his
grave
has
been
reformed
if
he
was
worth
reforming
at
all
while
the
arriving
host
of
youth
is
dancing
and
singing
and
jazzing
its
way
the
primrose
path
to
the
everlasting
this
is
but
another
evidence
of
our
national
hypocrisy
and
not
content
with
making
the
land
dry
which
we
done
at
all
we
must
go
out
and
make
the
sea
dry
our
attitude
has
caused
us
to
lose
our
sense
of
humor
verily
for
to
dry
up
the
ocean
is
going
moses
and
the
children
of
israel
one
better
moreover
the
day
of
miracles
is
past
it
was
in
the
early
fall
of
that
we
suddenly
discovered
that
our
ships
were
a
part
of
sacred
american
soil
international
law
had
long
since
told
us
so
but
somehow
in
the
confusion
following
the
passage
of
vaudeville
act
we
had
forgotten
it
perhaps
we
were
too
busy
like
the
wyoming
ladies
trying
to
make
our
citizens
good
on
shore
to
get
around
to
those
sensible
enough
to
leave
the
country
for
an
ocean
voyage
that
is
the
american
way
at
any
rate
our
boats
continued
under
lasker
to
be
pleasant
oases
on
the
desert
of
the
sea
and
fortunate
indeed
were
those
who
lived
along
the
coast
and
could
jump
aboard
if
things
became
unbearable
at
home
which
they
yet
it
was
good
to
know
that
there
the
ships
lay
in
harbor
ready
for
each
and
all
of
us
stocked
with
pleasant
and
rare
vintages
again
the
rich
were
in
luck
if
pocketbook
were
fat
enough
one
could
obtain
anything
one
desired
god
pity
the
poor
workingman
but
life
was
life
and
there
were
plenty
of
luxuries
which
had
always
been
denied
the
impoverished
but
which
the
wealthy
took
as
a
part
of
the
strange
scheme
of
things
and
oh
yes
it
was
awfully
unfair
but
that
was
that
and
after
all
what
was
one
to
do
about
it
and
it
was
too
bad
and
oh
dear
and
oh
my
and
goodness
gracious
and
a
lot
of
other
stuff
which
i
have
overheard
but
mercifully
forgotten
it
took
us
two
and
a
half
years
to
discover
in
one
minute
that
uncle
sam
himself
had
been
a
bootlegger
at
sea
a
long
long
time
to
have
had
our
own
eyes
sealed
but
when
attorney
general
daugherty
finally
issued
his
decision
that
american
boats
must
be
dry
all
sorts
of
complications
arose
we
told
foreign
governments
that
their
ships
too
must
not
enter
our
ports
with
liquor
aboard
all
the
ocean
within
the
limit
prescribed
by
international
law
was
to
cease
to
be
wet
it
mattered
not
that
italian
sailors
were
supplied
with
red
wine
as
part
of
their
fare
they
must
throw
it
overboard
before
they
came
into
our
sanctified
precincts
and
even
if
foreign
bars
were
sealed
and
padlocked
and
they
would
be
anathema
to
us
whether
the
liquor
brought
over
on
them
was
intended
to
be
sold
here
or
merely
kept
on
board
for
the
return
voyage
mattered
not
we
were
going
to
put
a
stop
to
and
now
mr
foreigner
what
are
you
going
to
do
about
it
as
this
is
written
england
has
already
protested
against
such
drastic
and
action
one
of
the
british
ships
has
been
seized
and
a
test
case
is
to
be
made
of
her
seizure
we
who
held
aloof
so
long
from
all
sorts
of
entangling
alliances
we
who
preached
the
doctrine
of
staying
at
home
and
minding
our
own
business
suddenly
find
ourselves
rushing
in
where
angels
fear
to
tread
and
losing
our
humor
we
may
likewise
lose
our
friends
the
powerful
league
is
responsible
for
our
foolhardiness
we
will
ruin
american
shipping
we
will
commit
maritime
harikari
but
it
is
all
right
since
having
slipped
our
heads
into
the
noose
of
the
fanatics
what
difference
does
it
make
how
soon
or
how
slowly
we
strangle
to
death
of
course
there
will
be
all
sorts
of
confusion
all
kinds
of
delays
in
the
courts
for
naturally
other
nations
will
make
test
cases
and
it
will
be
many
months
perhaps
years
before
america
knows
how
she
stands
with
europeans
and
how
europeans
stand
with
her
it
is
one
thing
to
manage
our
own
citizens
quite
another
to
guide
the
conduct
of
our
neighbors
it
is
curious
how
ships
and
shipping
enter
into
our
governmental
affairs
again
how
history
repeats
itself
deny
it
though
we
will
we
got
into
the
world
war
only
after
our
shipping
had
been
interfered
with
we
accepted
german
insults
and
taunts
but
the
moment
our
business
interests
were
at
stake
we
took
up
our
guns
and
rushed
to
save
the
allies
and
make
the
world
safe
for
democracy
a
utilitarian
reason
for
saving
our
own
necks
that
is
all
that
it
was
and
we
can
not
close
our
eyes
to
our
spiritual
shortcomings
now
we
have
the
effrontery
to
interfere
with
the
ships
and
shipping
of
foreign
countries
let
us
see
what
will
happen
to
us
remember
that
there
is
no
war
going
on
to
fill
people
with
emotion
and
ecstasy
this
is
to
be
a
cold
remedying
of
troubles
why
should
our
laws
be
respected
and
those
of
other
nations
treated
with
contempt
who
are
we
to
say
that
a
latin
sailor
should
not
consume
a
glass
of
red
wine
with
his
rations
no
one
can
tell
what
the
supreme
court
will
do
but
it
is
rather
obvious
that
if
america
has
closed
up
the
saloons
on
shore
she
should
close
them
up
on
sea
if
walking
a
street
in
one
of
our
cities
you
are
under
the
protection
of
the
stars
and
stripes
you
are
also
under
that
protection
pacing
the
deck
of
an
american
liner
prohibition
must
follow
the
flag
but
some
of
the
american
lines
are
talking
of
changing
the
flag
under
which
they
have
been
sailing
a
a
pretty
mess
it
is
unthinkable
that
a
liner
should
alter
her
citizenship
just
to
carry
a
bit
of
beer
yet
that
is
what
those
staid
old
ladies
are
contemplating
to
what
dreadful
deportment
are
we
driven
with
volstead
ruling
us
if
our
ships
have
to
go
dry
we
will
cut
off
the
large
freight
business
in
the
west
indies
since
much
rum
is
exported
from
these
islands
there
can
be
no
transportation
of
wine
to
countries
like
france
spain
and
italy
and
with
such
loss
in
revenue
how
can
our
boats
ply
to
and
fro
at
this
writing
hundreds
of
passengers
have
cancelled
their
sailings
on
american
vessels
incensed
at
the
attorney
ruling
the
new
york
which
has
been
a
consistent
and
fearless
enemy
of
prohibition
has
published
many
fine
editorials
on
the
subject
of
a
dry
sea
but
none
states
the
case
better
than
this
protest
that
it
will
ruin
the
american
merchant
marine
the
opinion
of
attorney
general
daugherty
regarding
the
sale
of
liquor
on
vessels
flying
the
flag
of
the
united
states
is
fairly
certain
to
be
upheld
by
the
courts
there
is
plenty
of
law
and
precedent
behind
it
but
every
phase
of
law
and
precedent
that
supports
the
opinion
as
it
touches
american
shipping
runs
counter
to
the
opinion
as
applied
to
liners
under
alien
flags
chartered
in
the
united
states
according
to
daugherty
are
subject
to
the
laws
of
the
united
states
are
in
fact
american
territory
but
ships
chartered
in
foreign
countries
are
not
foreign
territory
as
soon
as
they
enter
american
waters
all
vessels
subject
themselves
to
american
law
which
means
of
course
the
volstead
act
how
this
comes
about
is
not
clearly
explained
it
would
naturally
be
supposed
that
if
an
american
ship
were
american
territory
a
british
ship
would
be
british
territory
and
so
on
daugherty
can
not
have
it
both
ways
on
one
point
or
the
other
he
must
change
his
mind
or
have
it
changed
for
him
even
though
the
enforcement
law
did
not
apply
to
european
vessels
within
the
limit
it
is
difficult
to
discover
in
what
way
they
would
violate
it
by
carrying
a
sealed
supply
of
liquor
possession
of
liquor
as
defined
by
the
courts
must
include
a
change
of
ownership
it
is
not
legal
for
a
manufacturer
to
ship
liquor
to
a
consumer
through
the
united
states
but
it
is
legal
for
an
owner
of
bonded
liquor
to
remove
it
from
one
place
to
another
within
this
country
alien
ships
traversing
american
waters
with
sealed
liquor
aboard
would
be
guilty
of
nothing
which
american
citizens
are
not
allowed
on
land
by
judicial
well
if
the
bars
are
closed
forever
on
american
ships
it
will
but
add
to
the
present
discontent
and
again
there
will
be
an
expression
of
our
national
hypocrisy
it
does
not
take
much
vision
to
see
what
will
inevitably
happen
for
just
as
people
drink
now
on
land
when
they
feel
so
inclined
they
will
drink
upon
the
ocean
and
every
steward
on
every
american
liner
will
become
a
bootlegger
whispering
into
the
ears
of
passengers
something
like
this
i
have
some
fine
old
scotch
the
real
thing
only
twelve
dollars
a
bottle
want
some
see
that
brought
to
your
oh
no
not
a
particle
of
danger
doing
and
thus
will
the
comedy
go
on
thus
will
the
playing
of
the
farce
be
extended
beyond
the
limit
and
within
it
too
and
once
more
we
will
appear
before
the
world
in
our
cap
and
bells
no
arrests
will
be
made
things
will
simply
drift
along
and
by
and
by
even
though
the
eighteenth
amendment
remains
in
the
constitution
and
the
volstead
act
continues
to
be
a
part
of
our
laws
both
may
be
forgotten
just
as
some
of
the
old
statutes
of
the
puritans
still
upon
the
massachusetts
records
have
been
allowed
to
float
into
a
limbo
of
dreams
the
quandary
which
a
ship
finds
herself
in
sailing
from
great
britain
to
the
united
states
is
laughable
john
bull
demands
under
his
democratic
laws
made
for
freemen
that
a
certain
amount
of
brandy
be
a
part
of
every
cargo
whilst
uncle
sam
a
tyrant
now
refuses
to
permit
even
a
single
jug
of
ale
to
enter
the
sacred
limit
between
scylla
and
charibdis
the
hardy
mariner
finds
himself
on
what
reefs
of
the
mind
a
captain
plunges
as
dazedly
trying
to
obey
both
laws
he
reads
first
one
ruling
and
then
the
other
if
he
follows
john
he
is
out
with
sam
if
he
sticks
to
sam
he
is
the
of
john
this
might
be
the
sad
song
of
any
these
days
tweedledum
and
tweedledee
battledore
and
shuttlecock
alack
alas
no
more
at
sea
is
one
allowed
his
but
the
end
is
not
yet
of
course
there
will
be
concessions
many
wise
shakings
of
the
head
a
profound
slumber
over
tangled
legal
documents
and
then
perhaps
an
awakening
to
the
fact
that
after
all
a
attitude
scarcely
pays
in
these
times
of
human
frailty
we
may
realize
with
our
native
intelligence
that
we
have
made
a
foolish
a
terrible
a
hideous
mistake
worse
than
being
hated
by
other
nations
is
being
laughed
at
by
other
nations
can
america
stand
up
against
the
mirth
of
europe
over
our
and
smug
sanctimoniousness
if
laughter
has
killed
politicians
can
it
not
kill
nations
if
ridicule
can
end
a
career
can
it
not
end
national
nonsense
but
somehow
despite
heavy
mandates
and
injunctions
on
the
part
of
the
drys
something
tells
me
that
the
ocean
is
going
to
remain
indubitably
irremediably
habitually
irritatingly
and
everlastingly
wet
no
one
seems
to
know
just
where
we
are
destined
as
a
nation
to
take
our
way
we
fuss
and
fume
and
fret
in
the
race
of
life
we
put
endless
obstructions
along
the
track
and
leap
the
hurdles
clumsily
falling
now
and
then
picking
ourselves
up
falling
again
and
otherwise
behaving
rather
ridiculously
what
it
all
means
no
one
seems
to
know
instead
of
letting
well
enough
alone
we
seem
obsessed
with
the
idea
of
interfering
incessantly
with
goodly
folk
suppression
is
in
the
air
the
skies
are
clear
but
we
put
clouds
in
them
clouds
that
rise
from
the
earth
because
they
are
of
our
making
the
dust
of
the
world
shuts
out
the
clean
prospect
ahead
of
us
we
run
about
in
circles
when
so
simply
we
could
march
on
a
straight
line
we
are
very
very
stupid
and
though
we
know
it
now
we
are
afraid
to
admit
it
to
ourselves
again
our
hypocrisy
unable
to
respect
ourselves
and
our
own
institutions
how
can
we
ask
other
peoples
to
do
so
in
their
eagerness
to
make
the
ocean
round
about
the
united
states
dry
prohibition
officials
even
suggested
to
the
government
that
the
bahama
islands
be
purchased
from
great
britain
in
this
heavenly
haven
it
was
pointed
out
foregathered
perhaps
england
would
help
us
to
make
such
conditions
impossible
in
the
future
and
would
be
willing
to
let
the
islands
come
to
us
in
part
payment
of
the
old
war
debt
but
our
own
territory
in
that
direction
porto
rico
and
the
virgin
islands
are
still
far
from
dry
with
the
problem
of
these
localities
still
unsettled
it
would
seem
to
be
a
piece
of
folly
to
lay
hands
on
the
bahamas
in
the
hope
of
them
yet
why
stop
in
our
fanatic
zeal
at
the
bahamas
why
not
reach
out
and
get
the
canary
islands
indeed
everything
everywhere
we
who
preached
aloofness
until
we
were
blue
in
the
face
seem
suddenly
bent
upon
interfering
with
all
countries
no
matter
how
remote
they
may
be
when
men
were
actually
not
potentially
in
danger
of
death
and
destruction
we
would
not
lift
a
finger
to
aid
them
in
europe
but
now
with
a
mock
holiness
that
ill
comports
with
our
attitude
of
a
few
years
ago
we
are
for
saving
a
handful
of
drunkards
from
a
terrible
end
and
the
pity
of
it
is
that
we
do
not
see
how
funny
we
are

not
legally
permitted
under
this
article
to
possess
liquor
shall
be
prima

evidence
that
such
liquor
is
kept
for
the
purpose
of
being
sold
bartered
exchanged
given
away
furnished
or
otherwise
disposed
of
in
violation
of

of
this

and
the

of
proof
shall
be
upon
the
possessor
in
any
action
concerning
the

to
prove
that
such
liquor
was
lawfully
acquired
possessed
and
as
every
one
knows
in
ordinary
cases
a
defendant
is
considered
innocent
until
proved
guilty
but
here
we
see
a
dangerous
reversal
of
that
idea
in
jurisprudence
anyone
carrying
a
flask
would
be
considered
in
the
eyes
of
this
law
a
bootlegger
a
purveyor
of
illegal
goods
in
fact
a
criminal
even
though
no
evidence
had
been
produced
to
prove
him
so
in
our
anxiety
to
purify
the
nation
we
have
distorted
old
established
laws
turned
reasoning
and
once
more
made
ourselves
ridiculous
in
the
empire
state
at
least
making
many
laws
there
is
no
end
one
might
paraphrase
ecclesiastes
in
his
remarkably
interesting
book
changing
constitution
charles
pierson
points
out
the
growing
dangers
which
confront
us
because
of
our
repeated
amendments
and
addenda
he
sounds
many
a
warning
and
every
american
should
read
his
brief
but
profound
volume
view
one
may
hold
he
writes
to
the
question
of
expediency
no
thoughtful
mind
can
escape
the
conclusion
that
in
a
very
real
and
practical
sense
the
constitution
has
changed
in
a
way
change
is
inevitable
to
adapt
it
to
the
conditions
of
the
new
age
there
is
danger
however
that
in
the
process
of
change
something
may
be
lost
that
impatience
to
obtain
desired
results
by
the
shortest
and
most
effective
method
may
lead
to
the
sacrifice
of
a
principle
of
vast
importance
men
who
framed
the
constitution
were
well
advised
when
they
sought
to
preserve
the
integrity
of
the
states
as
a
barrier
against
the
aggressions
and
tyranny
of
the
majority
acting
through
a
centralized
power
the
words
acquired
an
odious
significance
in
the
days
of
our
civil
struggle
but
the
idea
for
which
they
stand
is
nevertheless
a
precious
one
and
represents
what
is
probably
most
valuable
contribution
to
the
science
of
government
shall
do
well
not
to
forget
the
words
of
that
staunch
upholder
of
national
power
and
authority
salmon
chase
speaking
as
chief
justice
of
the
supreme
court
in
a
famous
case
growing
out
of
the
civil
war
preservation
of
the
states
and
the
maintenance
of
their
governments
are
as
much
within
the
design
and
care
of
the
constitution
as
the
preservation
of
the
union
and
the
maintenance
of
the
national

the

in
all
its
provisions
looks
to
an
indestructible
union
composed
of

today
what
do
we
find
the
states
renouncing
their
sovereignty
abrogating
their
authority
to
the
central

time
and
again
diminishing
their
own
strength
losing
sight
of
one
of
the
very
things
on
which
the
safety
of
our
country
depends
worse
than
that
some
of
them
have
attempted
to
pass
laws
which
seem
totally
unnecessary
in
the
light
of
the
already
rigid
volstead
act
witness
the
state
of
new
jersey
for
instance
with
the
iniquitous
van
ness
act
which
fortunately
was
deemed
unconstitutional
early
in
frank
van
ness
while
a
member
of
the
new
jersey
assembly
from
essex
county
of
which
newark
is
the
county
seat
introduced
the
act
which
provided
that
a
complaint
is
made
before
any
magistrate
that
a
person
has
violated
one
or
more
of
the
provisions
of
this
act
it
shall
be
the
duty
of
such
magistrate
and
every
such
magistrate
is
hereby
given
full
power
and
authority
to
issue
his
warrant
to
arrest
any
such
person
so
complained
against
and
summarily
without
a
jury
and
without
any
pleadings
to
try
the
person
so
arrested
and
brought
before
him
and
to
determine
and
adjudge
his
guilt
or
the
volstead
act
plainly
states
that
anyone
violating
the
provisions
of
that
act
is
guilty
of
a
crime
van
act
was
an
attempt
to
have
such
persons
in
the
state
of
new
jersey
guilty
of
disorderly
conduct
which
would
not
require
a
trial
by
jury
the
new

legislature
passed
the
van

act
and
other
state
prohibition
laws
at
its
session
of
but
on
february
the
court
of
errors
and
appeals
of
new
jersey
held
that
a
number
of
the
provisions
of
the
van
ness
act
were
unconstitutional
the
prevailing
opinion
was
written
by
chancellor
walker
but
there
was
a
difference
among
the
judges
as
to
the
constitutionality
of
some
of
the
different
provisions
of
the
act
and
other
opinions
were
also
written
the
court
of

and
appeals
is
the
court
of
last
resort
in

and
by
its
judgment
it
reversed
the
supreme
court
finding
which
had
theretofore
held
the
van

act
to
be
constitutional
van
ness
was
a
candidate
for
reëlection
in
the
fall
of
but
was
not
reëlected
is
there
no
significance
in
this
fact
as
old
as
magna
charta
is
the
right
of
any
citizen
to
a
trial
by
jury
when
convicted
of
a
crime
and
as
old
too
as
that
sacred
document
is
the
theory
that
one
is
innocent
until
proved
guilty
yet
the
volstead
act
has
paved
the
way
for
politicians
without
vision
to
seek
to
destroy
these
inalienable
rights

the

upon

also
showed
how
tyrannical

was

sections

a
readjustment
of
there
is
a
tax
now
almost
everywhere
for
bread
and
butter
and
a
cover
charge
is
made
in
practically
all
the
metropolitan
restaurants
gradually
one
notes
these
are
creeping
in
one
can
not
blame
the
rents
and
wages
have
increased
since
the
war
therefore
they
must
ask
more
for
their
rooms
as
well
as
for
their
service
and
where
one
formerly
tipped
in
moderation
the
average
waiter
scorns
anything
less
than
fifteen
or
twenty
per
cent
of
the
amount
of
check
the
and
american
people
are
imposed
upon
at
every
turn
and
denied
the
privilege
of
consuming
liquor
openly
they
give
dinners
in
their
homes
where
at
least
there
can
be
a
semblance
of
harmless
gayety
this
causes
fewer
people
to
go
to
the
smart
restaurants
in
a
city
like
new
york
and
generally
there
is
no
supper
crowd
at
all
lights
are
dimmed
early
and
while
i
am
holding
no
brief
for
late
hours
i
do
think
that
human
beings
should
be
permitted
to
organize
their
own
lives
and
decide
for
themselves
whether
a
after
the
theater
or
the
opera
is
harmful
at
luncheon
time
the
hotels
present
another
aspect
they
still
do
a
thriving
business
but
as
i
have
said
in
a
previous
chapter
for
many
and
many
a
year
there
had
been
little
drinking
in
the
middle
of
the
day
with
fewer
people
to
serve
and
fewer
meals
to
serve
hotel
men
have
been
driven
to
ask
more
for
that
service
which
they
continue
to
render
the
one
bright
thought
in
this
painful
readjustment
is
the
fact
that
the
prohibitionists
must
help
the
rest
of
us
to
make
up
the
loss
of
revenue
their
checks
hitherto
much
less
than
ours
are
now
quite
the
same
but
then
i
imagine
few
of
them
have
ever
cared
for
brilliant
lights
and
smart
napery
preferring
to
dine
in
the
dim
sanctity
of
basements
and
back
rooms
at
an
hour
so
early
that
daylight
has
hardly
gone
when
the
rings
the
color
and
joy
of
the
ritz
or
the
plaza
would
scarcely
appeal
to
a
fanatic
but
to
get
back
to
the
bootleggers
there
are
many
degrees
of
them
some
are
honest
others
are
not
once
in
a
while
a
gin
bottle
will
contain
nothing
but
water
and
sometimes
whiskey
will
have
been
diluted
and
sold
as
the
regular
thing
yet
with
an
established
trade
and
recognized
business
conditions
are
improving
even
as
there
is
honor
among
thieves
the
latest
model
of
bootlegger
must
play
the
game
squarely
and
those
of
the
better
class
frown
upon
chicanery
and
are
disgusted
when
spurious
material
is
sold
they
realize
that
if
inferior
liquor
is
delivered
sales
may
soon
cease
altogether
therefore
those
who
have
their
best
interests
at
heart
and
their
name
is
legion
are
cautious
and
painstaking
and
will
honestly
tell
a
customer
whether
he
is
buying
synthetic
gin
or
stuff
i
do
not
pretend
to
know
the
workings
of
this
nefarious
trade
but
i
do
know
this
that
many
italians
and
germans
and
frenchmen
among
others
are
doing
a
thriving
business
and
are
only
too
glad
to
donate
part
of
their
enormous
commissions
to
the
local
ring
who
in
return
offer
them
complete
protection
and
from
talks
which
i
have
had
with
various
restaurant
proprietors
who
likewise
pay
graft
regularly
i
know
that
our
government
has
lost
the
respect
of
practically
every
foreigner
for
he
sees
not
only
his
own
people
defying
the
law
but
the
americans
disobeying
it
under
his
nose
he
says
that
so
long
as
there
are
grapes
on
vines
and
apples
on
trees
so
long
as
fermentation
is
a
natural
process
there
will
be
drinking
in
the
world
and
he
can
not
understand
why
it
is
against
the
law
to
take
a
sip
of
red
wine
with
spaghetti
or
a
nip
of
brandy
with
coffee
it
is
all
incomprehensible
to
him
his
children
grow
up
seeing
him
have
no
reverence
for
the
laws
of
the
country
he
has
adopted
of
course
the
prohibitionist
will
say
that
there
is
a
very
simple
solution
of
this
these
foreigners
within
our
gates
should
succumb
to
the
inevitable
and
obey
the
law
true
i
wish
that
everyone
would
obey
the
law
the
way
for
children
not
to
be
punished
at
school
is
for
them
to
behave
themselves
but
it
is
difficult
to
force
people
to
do
something
which
it
is
inherently
distasteful
for
them
to
do
we
invite
immigration
we
welcome
hordes
of
people
to
our
shores
people
who
we
know
are
accustomed
to
taking
wine
and
beer
with
their
meals
and
then
we
impose
strict
measures
upon
them
suddenly
and
expect
them
to
fall
into
line
we
should
educate
them
first
we
should
let
them
know
what
the
constitution
means
what
it
stands
for
we
should
insist
that
they
learn
our
language
study
the
history
of
the
united
states
absorb
the
meaning
of
america
before
they
attain
citizenship
we
are
loose
with
them
why
should
they
not
be
loose
with
us
they
see
that
we
are
none
too
careful
when
we
allow
them
to
cross
our
threshold
why
should
they
help
us
tidy
up
the
house
after
they
are
safely
within
it
the
truth
is
if
we
would
but
face
it
that
we
are
thorough
in
few
things
we
make
a
great
pretense
at
civic
virtue
and
national
righteousness
and
we
neglect
the
fundamentals
to
the
core
of
things
we
seldom
wish
to
go
the
bootlegger
laughing
in
his
sleeve
at
the
boasted
and
vainglorious
spiritual
integrity
of
america
is
but
the
natural
result
of
our
own
folly
he
is
as
inevitable
a
part
of
prohibition
as
feathers
are
a
part
of
birds
as
time
goes
on
his
business
now
conducted
in
secret
may
be
conducted
openly
he
may
become
a
recognized
figure
in
society
since
we
can
never
suppress
him
utterly
he
is
like
the
bounder
in
every
club
the
in
every
he
has
come
to
stay
the
pity
for
an
enormous
percentage
of
americans
approve
of
him
the
while
they
disapprove
of
him
they
know
his
faults
but
they
say
to
themselves
that
even
congressmen
have
faults
and
they
know
down
deep
in
their
hearts
that
many
a
congressman
and
many
an
exalted
judge
patronize
the
bootlegger
receive
social
calls
from
him
and
even
speak
to
him
on
the
telephone
when
they
are
to
others
the
bootleggers
know
all
this
why
should
they
therefore
venerate
a
system
which
is
not
treated
seriously
by
those
in
the
highest
places
we
are
asking
of
them
something
superhuman
and
the
latest
development
is
that
the
bootleggers
are
now
paying
income
taxes
openly
stating
the
source
of
their
earnings
with
no
fear
of
getting
into
trouble
meanwhile
the
propaganda
of
the
league
goes
on
in
the
newspapers
with
this
and
that
report
of
how
a
of
has
been
wiped
out
we
read
of
sensational
raids
in
the
big
cities
and
there
is
a
cry
that
federal
officers
have
the
whole
system
to
pieces
thousands
of
quarts
of
scotch
have
been
confiscated
where
it
is
placed
no
one
seems
to
know
dry
agents
in
their
zeal
even
search
hearses
and
make
the
undertakers
to
say
nothing
of
the
bereaved
relatives
of
the
deceased
quite
angry
the
time
may
come
when
may
be
taken
of
innocent
citizens
to
discover
whether
they
have
been
drinking
liquor
do
not
smile
anything
is
possible
when
a
great
country
allows
itself
to
be
governed
by
an
organization
of
fanatics
who
have
intimidated
congress
and
seem
bent
upon
ruining
our
shipping
industry
but
it
would
appear
almost
impossible
to
get
honest
men
to
act
in
the
capacity
of
spies
there
is
an
everlasting
of
federal
officials
who
are
supposed
to
see
that
the
volstead
act
is
enforced
here
again
the
human
element
enters
that
element
which
the
fanatics
never
recognize
the
temptations
are
too
great
for
the
average
man
he
knows
that
bootleggers
are
getting
rich
and
soon
he
sees
that
if
he
closes
his
eyes
and
opens
his
hand
he
too
can
become
a
crœsus
at
first
it
may
be
that
he
hesitates
there
is
danger
of
being
caught
well
why
not
take
a
chance
he
says
to
himself
others
are
doing
it
after
all
one
has
to
live
and
a
car
be
nice
thus
is
the
voice
of
conscience
quieted
and
soon
it
ceases
to
whisper
at
all
that
little
italian
restaurant
in
his
district
ah
yes
they
dispense
drinks
to
the
favored
few
who
know
the
ring
the
bell
must
be
given
it
would
be
so
easy
to
pretend
that
he
does
not
know
of
its
existence
and
tony
after
all
is
not
such
a
bad
sort
hand
over
the
kale
without
a
question
without
a
murmur
and
so
one
more
federal
official
goes
to
the
dogs
a
man
who
until
yesterday
was
honest
knowing
that
his
lucrative
career
may
be
brief
he
has
determined
to
make
hay
while
the
sun
shines
and
prohibition
has
created
another
crook
in
the
wicked
city
though
of
course
it
has
cured
a
drunkard
in
the
virtuous
country
and
the
people
are
perfectly
satisfied
are
you
chapter
xii
joke
about
not
content
with
forcing
us
to
close
our
lips
to
liquor
the
prohibitionists
recently
sent
out
a
request
which
amounted
to
an
order
that
no
one
should
open
his
lips
to
speak
disparagingly
or
in
jest
of
the
sacred
eighteenth
amendment
we
were
to
be
denied
the
blessed
privilege
of
laughing
at
ourselves
even
i
suppose
that
a
few
fanatics
oh
merely
to
study
life
bless
their
hearts
had
gone
into
a
vaudeville
theater
and
had
been
incensed
at
the
ribaldry
of
the
actors
and
the
shrieks
of
mirth
of
the
audience
over
prohibition
wheezes
i
have
seen
an
assemblage
in
convulsions
when
some
light
mention
was
made
of
volstead
and
whenever
a
flask
is
displayed
on
the
screen
of
some
movie
house
there
never
fails
to
follow
a
round
of
loud
applause
our
comic
weeklies
and
newspaper
supplements
continue
to
print
prohibition
jokes
much
to
the
delight
of
their
readers
one
fearless
periodical
has
come
out
openly
for
light
wines
and
beer
and
lost
a
valued
contributor
thereby
another
paper
on
the
contrary
solemnly
prints
this
editorial
headed
are
jokes
and
great
concern
operating
vaudeville
theaters
in
most
of
the
large
cities
has
issued
an
order
that
all
performers
must
cut
out
their
jokes
about
prohibition
this
is
progress
it
should
be
followed
by
orders
to
eliminate
prohibition
jokes
from
our
legislatures
courts
police
stations
city
halls
and
all
other
places
where
men
supposed
to
be
serious
and
doing
serious
work
are
to
be
found
the
outstanding
fact
about
prohibition
seems
to
be
that
people
forget
that
it
came
about
through
an
amendment
to
the
united
states
meanwhile
the
joke
is
tolerated
and
roared
at
it
is
perfectly
all
right
for
a
man
to
make
fun
of
his
mother
since
there
is
no
formal
statute
against
such
jests
but
it
is
unthinkable
that
he
should
laugh
at
himself
because
he
get
a
simple
glass
of
beer
the
country
he
fought
for
and
was
willing
to
die
for
denies
him
an
ancient
form
of
enjoyment
he
could
make
fun
openly
of
negroes
though
the
fifteenth
amendment
tells
him
that
they
are
his
peers
the
reformer
you
see
never
counted
upon
the
chaffing
which
the
volstead
act
would
have
to
stand
ridicule
can
kill
anything
and
they
know
it
now
therefore
they
must
stop
ridicule
by
mandate
heaven
knows
there
is
little
to
smile
at
these
days
except
prohibition
are
we
to
have
that
luxury
taken
from
us
too
it
looks
that
way
yet
no
law
can
control
innermost
feelings
no
request
amounting
to
an
order
can
coerce
a
nation
to
do
something
it
is
not
impelled
to
do
of
itself
one
remembers
a
sad
time
not
so
long
ago
when
we
were
begged
to
remain
neutral
in
thought
word
and
deed
and
notices
were
printed
in
theater
programs
urging
us
to
make
no
demonstration
when
the
troops
of
the
allies
crossed
the
screen
to
give
no
sign
when
the
german
army
did
likewise
yet
there
was
a
burst
of
applause
or
a
burst
of
hisses
just
the
same
the
minds
of
a
people
can
not
be
controlled
it
is
nonsense
to
try
to
control
them
now
the
fanatics
would
seek
to
rob
us
of
the
joy
of
laughter
for
of
course
they
despise
and
detest
laughter
laughter
ridicule
is
a
sword
that
can
be
used
against
them
we
can
make
this
whole
business
of
prohibition
so
ludicrous
that
we
can
laugh
it
out
of
the
statutes
guffaws
have
disturbed
many
a
solemn
meeting
and
a
single
cartoon
has
broken
many
a
promising
politician
one
may
be
able
to
stand
up
against
a
serious
argument
but
lampooning
has
destroyed
even
men
of
genius
all
was
to
be
well
the
moment
the
eighteenth
amendment
became
a
fact
everyone
was
going
to
sit
still
and
take
it
very
seriously
just
as
the
prohibitionists
had
planned
the
lid
was
on
and
on
it
would
remain
forever
and
ever
puritans
have
no
sense
of
humor
or
they
would
not
be
puritans
they
had
not
dreamed
that
someone
would
overturn
the
can
on
which
the
lid
was
placed
and
through
sheer
joy
of
living
shout
and
sing
as
of
old
the
habits
of
generations
can
not
be
changed
in
a
moment
we
who
had
been
accustomed
to
decent
drinking
did
not
intend
to
stop
at
once
we
would
off
as
the
topers
put
it
we
had
laid
aside
a
little
supply
of
jollity
and
the
word
would
go
about
that
had
a
large
enough
and
deep
enough
cellar
to
permit
him
to
entertain
for
at
least
three
or
four
years
one
of
the
strange
things
about
prohibition
was
the
fact
that
with
its
coming
everyone
imagined
that
everyone
else
would
turn
miser
concerning
treating
but
here
again
the
human
element
was
forgotten
everyone
seems
more
anxious
than
ever
to
prove
that
his
bootlegger
has
an
exhaustless
supply
and
a
certain
pride
is
taken
in
handing
out
innumerable
drinks
an
aristocracy
has
arisen
that
even
serves
liqueurs
after
coffee
as
though
a
plethora
of
de
and
yellow
and
green
chartreuse
were
in
the
land
the
proverbial
generosity
of
the
american
was
never
more
in
evidence
where
one
was
niggardly
perhaps
in
the
old
days
one
can
scarcely
afford
to
be
so
now
and
those
who
accept
drinks
without
returning
them
are
frowned
upon
as
unworthy
they
are
the
outcasts
of
a
new
society
the
lowest
form
of
of
course
they
are
not
nearly
so
numerous
as
of
old
therefore
they
are
more
conspicuous
and
so
the
laughter
goes
on
but
even
when
the
reformers
do
not
hear
it
they
writhe
knowing
of
its
existence
once
in
a
great
while
some
echo
reaches
them
no
doubt
things
have
not
as
they
had
anticipated
and
so
they
squirm
and
rage
and
puff
up
and
devise
ways
and
means
to
call
a
complete
halt
on
all
merriment
whether
it
is
directed
at
them
or
not
in
all
seriousness
a
temperance
society
sent
a
mandate
to
every
editor
in
the
united
states
not
long
ago
bidding
them
cease
satirizing
prohibition
it
would
not
do
they
contended
to
continue
to
smile
at
the
sacred
eighteenth
amendment
volstead
also
was
sacrosanct
and
it
was
outrageous
the
way
piety
was
and
what
did
the
editors
by
such
conduct
and
why
they
stop
it
and
obey
teacher
and
be
good
and
every
government
official
when
he
gets
up
at
a
banquet
to
make
a
speech
begs
his
hearers
to
heed
the
law
though
he
knows
full
well
that
down
the
street
another
banquet
may
be
going
on
attended
by
officials
equally
high
where
the
law
is
never
thought
of
it
is
a
sad
commentary
on
our
government
when
it
is
necessary
thus
to
address
the
people
must
be
one
people
one
union
and
that
the
american
union
shouted
one
representative
of
the
government
speaking
in
chicago
before
a
business
convention
and
he
went
on
to
say
a
newspaper
ridicules
a
law
plays
up
a
policy
of
contempt
for
law
and
its
enforcement
and
in
its
news
and
editorial

more
to
destroy
american

a

can
do
to

no
man
in

life
who
is
possessed
of

realizes
his
responsibility
to

would
favor
regulation
of
the
public

but
it
is
obvious
that
the
power
of
the

must
not
be
used
to
foster
disrespect
for
our
government
and
disobedience
to
its
free

will
not
be
tolerated
if
the
fanatics
have
their
way
yet
the
first
article
in
the
amendments
to

says
shall
make
no
law
respecting
an
establishment
of
religion
or
prohibiting
the
free

thereof

of

but
to
get
back
for
a
moment
to
the
ladies
of
the
temperance
society
a
brilliant
writer
edward
martin
answered
them
delightfully
in
and
with
the
kind
permission
of
the
editors
of
that
periodical
i
am
privileged
to
make
extracts
from
his
article
martin
never
loses
his
temper
as
the
ladies
certainly
did
he
remains
as
ever
the
tactful
urbane
pitying
occupant
of
the
he
does
not
even
frown
he
speaks
from
a
long
experience
gently
but
to
the
point
enforcement
of
prohibition
meets
with
some
obstacles
and
furnishes
food
for
thought
to
two
large
groups
in
the
community
the
people
who
want
it
enforced
and
the
people
who
occasionally
want
something
to
drink
just
at
the
moment
it
seems
as
if
the
people
who
want
a
drink
are
somewhat
ahead
of
the
other
group
in
the
competition
at
any
rate
the
group
that
wants
enforcement
seems
to
think
it
necessary
to
make
extra
effort
to
as
doubtless
to
hundreds
of
other
periodicals
has
come
a
communication
from
the
committee
for
prohibition
enforcement
of
a
and
powerful
organization
of
women
which
announces
that
the
committee
has
adopted
a
program
the
items
of
which
it
communicates
the
fifth
item
is
to
the
effect
that
all
the
ministers
be
urged
to
preach
and
teach
the
necessity
for
respect
for
and
observance
of
the
law
the
sixth
item
runs
every
theatrical
manager
movie
manager
and
editor
whether
of
a
daily
weekly
or
monthly
publication
be
requested
to
see
that
all
jokes
ridiculing
prohibition
and
its
enforcement
are
eliminated
from
any
production
film
or
article
coming
under
his
jurisdiction
and
that
the
matter
be
treated
with
that
seriousness
that
the
subject
merits
and
that
this
resolution
be
thrown
on
the
screen
and
printed
in
the
different
papers
and
magazines
throughout
the
demand
for
protection
from
jokes
is
often
made
and
always
implies
that
there
is
something
that
needs
to
be
joked
about
there
is
a
sin
called
if
we
joke
about
things
that
are
sacred
to
enough
people
it
gives
a
kind
of
offense
which
even
if
the
law
does
not
punish
it
it
is
not
safe
to
excite
there
is
a
sin
of
blasphemy
which
we
suppose
the
law
will
still
punish
if
it
is
gross
enough
it
will
be
agreed
that
the
considerate
people
do
not
jest
about
sacred
things
nor
even
about
things
which
though
not
sacred
to
themselves
are
sacred
to
the
people
they
are
talking
to
well
then
is
prohibition
one
of
these
sacred
things
we
must
not
talk
about
are
amendments
of
the
constitution
and
the
volstead
law
to
rank
with
the
ten
commandments
and
the
sermon
on
the
mount
as
not
being
safely
subject
to
derisive
comment
like
that
seems
to
be
in
the
minds
of
the
women
whose
communication
we
have
received
who
include
item
six
in
their
program
but
if
so
their
attitude
is
wrong
a
constitutional
amendment
is
not
sacred
much
less
a
volstead
act
it
is
the
volstead
law
that
the
jokes
on
prohibition
are
aimed
at
more
than
the
amendment
if
we
can
not
joke
about
an
act
of
congress
then
indeed
things
have
come
to
a
restricted
pass
if
a
law
is
bad
one
of
the
ways
to
beat
it
is
to
laugh
it
out
of
court
if
that
is
being
done
about
the
volstead
law
the
ladies
who
want
that
law
enforced
would
do
well
to
examine
it
and
see
why
it
is
not
enforced
rather
than
try
to
stop
jokers
from
laughing
at
it
letter
writer
to
a
newspaper
says
it
is
true
that
a
community
gets
the
kind
of
government
it
deserves
it
is
equally
true
that
a
law
gets
the
kind
of
obedience
it
his
assertion
may
be
disputed
but
still
if
the
volstead
law
is
not
being
respected
is
it
certain
that
it
deserves
respect
it
is
a
law
in
the
process
of
being
tried
out
if
it
is
good
we
want
it
enforced
if
it
is
bad
we
want
it
amended
but
we
do
not
want
to
be
choked
off
from
discussing
it
or
testing
it
there
is
no
power
in
congress
to
say
what
is
right
or
wrong
the
most
that
congress
can
do
is
to
say
what
is
lawful
or
unlawful
the
distinction
is
important
the
practical
judge
of
whether
a
law
is
right
or
wrong
is
the
general
community
to
which
the
law
applies
if
that
community
will
not
back
up
the
enforcement
of
the
law
it
will
not
be
enforced
it
is
yet
to
be
demonstrated
how
far
the
volstead
law
as
it
stands
is
enforceable
if
its
fruits
do
not
please
a
majority
of
the
people
who
live
under
it
it
may
have
to
be
modified
so
that
it
will
stand
for
something
that
is
near
enough
to
be
the
popular
judgment
of
what
is
right
to
win
popular
support
there
is
a
great
deal
of
good
in
the
present
prohibition
movement
it
put
the
saloons
out
of
business
it
checked
the
brewers
and
distillers
in
their
efforts
to
sell
their
products
it
accomplished
benefits
which
probably
could
not
have
been
accomplished
except
by
the
kind
of
clean
sweep
that
the
amendment
was
but
it
was
necessarily
a
rough
job
an
experiment
to
be
tried
out
in
practice
if
its
rules
need
modification
they
may
get
it
or
they
may
not
but
if
not
they
may
be
practically
modified
in
enforcement
is
boss
in
this
country
is
it
the
president
the
senate
the
house
the
supreme
court
the
state
authorities
the
newspapers
the
lawyers
the
ministers
the
doctors
or
possibly
the
women
of
them
public
opinion
is
the
boss
in
the
long
run
what
public
opinion
demands
it
gets
laws
to
be
of
any
worth
have
to
have
sanction
that
is
there
must
be
something
to
make
people
who
violate
them
feel
that
they
are
doing
wrong
the
laws
of
nature
have
abundant
sanction
if
you
fool
with
the
law
of
gravitation
you
get
bumped
there
is
no
trouble
about
the
enforcement
of
the
law
of
gravitation
nobody
goes
around
begging
you
not
to
ridicule
it
it
takes
care
of
itself
and
if
you
flout
it
you
pay
the
consequences
the
ten
commandments
have
a
sanction
of
long
experience
some
of
them
are
obsolete
but
the
others
are
respected
and
though
they
are
not
directly
enforced
by
the
courts
laws
based
on
them
are
so
enforced
public
opinion
hereabouts
rests
very
considerably
on
the
ten
commandments
they
have
shaped
the
habits
of
thought
and
deportment
of
many
millions
of
people
including
most
of
those
now
living
in
this
country
trouble
with
the
present
enforcement
of
prohibition
is
that
it
has
not
yet
got
moral
sanction
enough
to
make
it
effective
public
opinion
will
back
up
the
law
in
closing
the
saloons
and
restricting
and
regulating
the
sale
of
intoxicants
but
it
does
not
follow
it
for
one
thing
in
defining
a
beverage
with
an
alcoholic
content
of
one
half
of
one
per
cent
as
intoxicating
when
it
comes
to
that
public
opinion
laughs
because
that
is
contrary
to
its
experience
furthermore
public
opinion
shows
as
yet
no
particular
fervor
about
achieving
a
total
stoppage
of
alcoholic
supplies
from
those
who
want
them
no
serious
stigma
attaches
to
violations
of
the
volstead
law
by
private
buyers
fines
and
like
embarrassments
may
result
but
not
disrepute
a
good
many
fairly
decent
people
seem
to
buy
what
they
want
and
do
not
conceal
it
the
people
who
thought
before
the
law
was
adopted
that
it
was
wicked
or
inexpedient
to
drink
intoxicants
still
think
so
the
people
who
thought
otherwise
continue
to
think
otherwise
many
people
drink
less
than
before
the
law
began
to
operate
but
a
good
many
other
people
drink
more
and
buy
much
worse
beverages
at
much
higher
prices
to
some
extent
prohibition
seems
to
have
made
drinking
popular
by
diminishing
the
individual
discouragement
of
it
and
putting
the
responsibility
for
the
maintenance
of
temperance
on
a
law
and
the
officers
who
enforce
it
that
may
be
only
a
temporary
effect
but
if
it
turns
out
that
the
volstead
law
as
it
is
can
not
be
enforced
at
the
present
time
there
may
possibly
be
an
effort
to
tinker
it
to
put
it
into
such
shape
that
public
opinion
will
stand
back
of
it
and
give
it
a
sanction
the
alternative
would
be
to
wait
and
see
what
effect
time
will
have
on
men
and
habits
there
is
no
one
to
tell
us
that
we
shall
be
damned
if
we
disobey
the
volstead
law
and
so
long
as
juries
refuse
to
convict
persons
who
violate
it
it
stands
modified
in
practice
organizations
political
commercial
religious
that
seek
to
shape
public
opinion
all
use
propaganda
we
all
know
what
that
means
because
we
have
all
had
such
a
surfeit
of
it
during
the
war
we
were
flooded
with
it
and
everyone
learned
what
it
was
and
how
to
use
it
it
is
put
out
by
speakers
on
the
movie
screens
and
in
print
wherever
possible
organization
secured
prohibition
but
organization
is
not
public
opinion
and
may
for
a
time
override
it
organization
works
on
the
run
with
noise
and
big
headlines
and
meetings
and
even
with
threats
public
opinion
slowly
takes
form
in
the
minds
of
individuals
there
comes
in
saying
about
the
impossibility
of
fooling
all
the
people
all
the
time
propaganda
may
overwhelm
private
judgment
for
a
time
but
private
judgment
keeps
on
working
after
propaganda
ceases
it
digests
what
has
been
offered
to
it
the
common
facts
of
life
continue
to
appeal
to
it
and
impress
it
it
views
what
propaganda
has
accomplished
and
slowly
and
deliberately
considers
whether
it
is
good
and
if
it
concludes
that
it
is
not
good
it
ceases
to
back
it
and
then
there
has
to
be
something
different
something
that
looks
like
improvement
chapter

how
canada
has
solved
the
liquor
problem
sing
a
song
of
montreal
a
barrel
full
of
rye
yankees
feeling
rather
dry
when
the
barrel
was
opened
they
all
began
to
sing
to
hell
with
volstead
and
god
save
the
king
the
dominion
of
canada
has
solved
its
liquor
problem
for
the
most
part
it
is
interesting
to
note
that
in
those
provinces
which
are
technically
dry
a
wretched
state
of
things
exists
as
in
the
united
states
and
those
provinces
which
have
government
control
are
well
ordered
for
instance
nova
scotia
has
absolute
prohibition
i
went
there
in
may
and
june
and
as
in
the
states
i
never
lacked
for
a
drink
when
i
desired
one
practically
every
chemist
is
a
bootlegger
to
show
you
how
badly
the
system
works
let
me
tell
of
a
personal
experience
i
found
myself
one
in
a
little
village
which
shall
be
nameless
i
inquired
of
the
if
it
would
be
possible
to
obtain
a
bottle
of
whiskey
he
said
go
to
the
tell
him
you
are
a
guest
of
mine
and
i
think
you
will
have
no
difficulty
in
getting
a
good
i
was
surprised
to
say
the
least
it
chanced
to
be
a
sunday
morning
the
church
bells
were
ringing
and
as
i
got
to
the
door
of
the
shop
the
druggist
was
just
leaving
it
he
lived
above
it
i
believe
for
morning
service
i
told
him
my
errand
and
immediately
without
the
slightest
hesitation
he
opened
the
door
took
me
in
and
sold
me
what
i
wished
he
the
slightest
idea
who
i
was
yet
perhaps
it
was
evident
that
i
was
an
american
traveler
no
questions
were
asked
and
openly
i
carried
my
bottle
through
the
streets
back
to
the
inn
in
new
brunswick
i
obtained
ale
openly
in
a
hotel
and
the
waitress
told
me
that
almost
on
every
other
corner
of
the
city
in
which
i
was
stopping
a
bootlegger
could
be
found
and
if
i
made
my
wishes
known
there
would
be
no
difficulty
in
purchasing
anything
i
wanted
as
it
happened
i
wished
nothing
there
but
it
was
good
to
know
that
it
could
have
been
bought
any
time
of
the
day
or
evening
but
in
the
province
of
quebec
and
in
british
columbia
quite
another
state
of
affairs
will
be
found
the
government
controls
the
liquor
trade
and
guarantees
the
quality
of
the
alcohol
sold
neat
little
government
liquor
stores
as
they
are
called
are
in
every
city
and
town
and
a
vendor
has
charge
of
each
one
a
regular
government
employee
who
is
for
the
of
the
government
liquor
act
and
the
regulations
so
far
as
they
relate
to
the
conduct
of
the
store
and
the
sale
of
liquor
everything
is
done
in
a
most
orderly
and
systematic
way
if
one
wishes
to
purchase
whiskey
he
merely
applies
to
the
vendor
in
his
neighborhood
a
small
fee
is
charged
and
it
is
a
gratification
to
know
that
this
fee
goes
directly
to
government
and
not
into
the
pockets
of
bootleggers
supplies
are
delivered
in
sealed
packages
duly
inscribed
and
again
it
is
a
gratification
to
know
that
one
is
in
no
danger
of
drinking
poison
with
the
added
fear
of
death
or
blindness
there
are
restrictions
a
great
many
indeed
but
they
are
wise
and
for
the
best
interests
of
the
province
for
instance
it
is
against
the
law
to
drink
in
the
government
stores
but
one
may
of
course
in
an
inn
have
a
supply
of
liquor
in
room
or
drink
light
wines
and
beer
in
the
public
drunkenness
is
taboo
and
one
sees
very
little
of
it
the
people
are
prosperous
and
everyone
is
as
happy
as
one
can
be
in
this
troubled
world
canada
had
enormous
war
debts
i
was
told
that
british
columbia
had
paid
her
quota
and
in
addition
had
made
many
improvements
of
public
highways
all
through
the
revenue
derived
from
the
sale
of
liquor
in
british
columbia
great
care
is
exercised
that
no
spurious
permits
are
received
at
the
stores
the
law
provides
that
permit
shall
be
delivered
to
the
applicant
until
he
has
in
the
presence
of
the
vendor
or
official
to
whom
the
application
is
made
written
his
signature
thereon
in
the
manner
prescribed
for
purposes
of
his
identification
as
the
holder
thereof
and
the
signature
has
been
attested
by
the
vendor
or
official
under
his
permits
are
not
issued
to
corporations
associations
societies
or
partnerships
therefore
the
opportunities
for
fraud
are
diminished
and
on
polling
days
all
the
stores
are
closed
in
times
in
the
united
states
the
law
distinctly
said
that
our
saloons
should
remain
closed
on
election
day
in
many
of
the
big
cities
yet
was
this
regulation
a
very
wise
one
ever
enforced
that
is
one
reason
why
we
have
prohibition
today
we
simply
would
not
obey
even
those
moderate
and
salutary
laws
enacted
for
the
welfare
of
the
community
the
paid
not
the
slightest
heed
to
them
in
fact
he
scoffed
at
them
and
that
is
why
he
has
no
sympathy
from
the
rest
of
us
now
that
his
foul
places
are
gone
forever
one
would
not
be
so
foolish
as
to
assert
that
a
state
of
perfection
has
been
reached
in
the
provinces
bootlegging
goes
on
but
principally
because
this
country
is
dry
if
the
states
were
also
under
government
control
in
the
matter
of
the
liquor
traffic
there
would
be
no
temptation
to
transport
stuff
illicitly
over
the
border
i
imagine
that
the
canadians
are
quite
as
guilty
as
the
americans
when
it
comes
to
these
secret
transactions
for
if
it
takes
two
to
make
a
quarrel
it
is
equally
true
that
it
takes
two
to
consummate
a
sale
of
any
kind
there
would
be
a
cleaner
slate
if
we
had
the
common
sense
to
do
as
say
quebec
has
done
there
are
no
saloons
but
there
are
tidy
shops
where
one
is
not
ashamed
to
go
no
one
is
drinking
on
the
sly
pretending
to
be
consuming
coffee
out
of
a
cup
which
really
contains
a
vino
is
not
the
motto
of
canada
as
it
is
that
of
the
united
states
it
is
significant
to
note
that
in
british
columbia
when
that
province
was
completely
dry
even
without
beer
prescriptions
for
liquor
were
issued
yet
in
the
fiscal
year
which
ended
march
only
prescriptions
were
issued
and
while
our
own
government
continues
to
ask
for
mighty
appropriations
for
the
enforcement
of
prohibition
the
reports
from
the
province
of
quebec
state
that
for
the
fiscal
year
ending
in
june
a
profit
of
was
realized
and
that
the
regulations
have
proved
quite
as
successful
morally
as
financially
can
we
say
that
in
the
matter
of
morals
the
volstead
act
has
worked
advantageously
it
has
undermined
the
whole
country
and
under
fanaticism
we
have
shown
ourselves
to
be
a
total
failure
the
new
york
says
quebec
law
is
a
good
law
because
it
has
city
and
country
solidly
behind
it
and
it
can
be
enforced
it
provides
for
local
option
it
restricts
the
purchase
of
spirits
it
allows
the
sale
of
wine
and
beer
in
cafés
and
it
creates
no
enforcement
problem
it
affects
every
legitimate
reform
advocated
by
the
professional
prohibitionists
of
the
united
states
but
quietly
sensibly
profitably
and
without
if
we
could
but
come
to
the
sanity
of
canada
in
her
provinces
chapter
xiv
crime
and
drunkenness
promises
were
made
by
the
reformers
that
with
the
advent
of
prohibition
the
country
would
witness
a
great
lessening
of
crime
and
drunkenness
our
prisons
were
to
be
almost
emptied
unemployment
would
be
practically
unheard
of
and
the
health
of
the
people
would
be
infinitely
better
never
has
the
country
suffered
more
from
strikes
than
during
that
period
between
and
the
present
time
labor
is
still
restless
for
all
the
sanctimonious
predictions
of
the
league
we
see
then
that
law
and
order
do
not
come
when
we
harness
a
will
would
that
they
did
life
would
be
simple
then
people
are
bound
to
burst
their
bonds
and
fetters
now
and
then
the
spurt
of
the
geyser
goes
on
no
matter
how
we
seek
to
suppress
it
old
faithful
performs
every
hour
in
yellowstone
park
and
i
suppose
that
until
time
is
no
more
men
will
go
on
shouting
about
their
rights
despite
such
empty
reforms
as
prohibition
will
go
on
holding
grievances
demanding
a
remedy
of
wrongs
and
generally
raising
cain
obstreperous
behavior
is
not
the
result
of
drunkenness
always
people
are
humanly
fond
of
cavorting
even
without
the
aid
of
a
stimulant
and
so
the
strikes
go
merrily
on
and
workingmen
who
were
placid
under
beer
are
found
to
be
thinkers
under
volsteadism
the
headlines
in
our
papers
continue
to
be
sensational
in
these
times
that
were
to
be
so
quiet
murders
still
occur
strangely
enough
and
of
the
most
brazen
kind
take
place
everywhere
diamond
are
snatched
from
ladies
driving
in
the
park
of
an
evening
houses
are
entered
by
ruffians
who
tie
up
the
servants
and
the
master
and
mistress
and
calmly
go
through
the
premises
taking
what
they
wish
it
is
all
very
shocking
very
terrible
but
human
nature
has
a
way
of
remaining
what
it
is
it
was
thought
that
only
drunkards
committed
such
heinous
crimes
we
find
that
men
of
sobriety
are
equally
culpable
the
millennium
has
not
arrived
and
our
prisons
are
still
densely
populated
much
as
the
reformers
may
deny
the
disconcerting
fact
one
is
shocked
at
the
continuance
of
outrageous
crimes
and
if
after
three
years
of
experiment
with
the
abolishment
of
booze
we
still
face
a
wave
of
disorder
and
confusion
there
seems
little
hope
of
that
future
of
roses
and
sweetness
and
light
so
glibly
prophesied
hard
times
continue
to
confront
us
though
the
fat

the
wife
and
children
of
the

was
to
be

small
increases
in

from
these

had
been
noticed
early
in

of
last
year
but
the
change
attracted
little
attention
and
caused
little
comment
the
possibility
that
it
marked
a
definite
check
in
the
favorable
tendency
shown
for
several
years
for
each
of
these
diseases
was
not
seriously
considered
by

however
the
death
rate
had
taken
a
more
decided
upward
turn
for

rose
from

that

from

by

it
had
become
apparent
that
for
two
of
these
diseases
at
least
a
definite
upward
tendency
was
in
progress
the
heart

rate
increased
sharply
from
the

the

fell

the

rose
even
more
sharply
than
for

to
the

rate
again
increased
slightly
to

that

apoplexy
returned
to
approximately
the

level
by

the

organic

had
reached
per
one
of
the
highest
figures
ever
recorded
in

one
month
among
metropolitan
industrial

the

rates
for

are
both
the
highest
registered
for
those
diseases
since
march
the
association
against

has
collected
statistics
to
prove
that
crime
has
by
no
means
diminished
since
the
passage

with
their
kind
permission
i
give
a

twenty

are
the
official
figures
in

have

statistics
from

how

it

take
it

that

given

a

at

were

chapter
xv
the
literary
canvass
the
cry
has
gone
up
from
time
to
time
since
the
passage
of
the
volstead
act
that
the
country
at
large
wanted
nay
had
demanded
prohibition
literary
hearing
and
noting
these
reiterations
decided
to
investigate
the
feeling
of
the
land
they
would
have
a
referendum
of
the
people
through
a
straw
vote
and
they
would
get
in
that
way
at
the
truth
many
of
us
were
not
at
all
sure
of
the
sentiment
in
communities
like
the
far
and
middle
west
we
knew
that
the
south
for
reasons
best
known
to
itself
had
favored
large
arid
territories
but
the
east
had
remained
insistently
wet
therefore
it
was
a
big
surprise
when
the
returns
began
to
come
in
to
discover
that
in
many
sections
a
reverse
feeling
flourished
from
that
which
had
been
anticipated
it
must
have
proved
a
shock
to
the
league
in
its
smug
complacency
to
learn
that
many
citizens
like
a
man
i
met
in
omaha
declared
that
he
was
greatly
in
favor
of
prohibition
until
we
got
it
indeed
many
feel
just
like
that
conditions
are
certainly
intolerable
wherever
i
have
been
drunkenness
may
have
disappeared
from
the
sidewalks
but
it
has
taken
to
the
taxicab
and
though
the
corner
saloon
has
gone
i
hope
forever
the
has
taken
its
place
on
the
corner
of
many
an
individual
so
much
had
been
said
and
written
of
the
feeling
of
the
country
that
the
the
is
a
prohibitionist
if
i
am
not
mistaken
went
right
to
the
heart
of
the
thing
in
no
uncertain
manner
much
discussion
had
taken
place
as
to
the
temper
of
the
people
and
there
seemed
no
way
of
arriving
at
the
truth
ten
million
blanks
were
sent
out
to
every
kind
of
voter
the
bonus
for
soldiers
and
sailors
was
more
or
less
tied
up
with
prohibition
therefore
it
was
deemed
wise
to
try
to
get
the
popular
sentiment
on
both
questions
at
the
same
time
the
questionnaire
in
the
form
of
a
ballot
was
as
follows
secret
ballot
on
prohibition
and
bonus
no
signature
no
condition
no
obligation

favor

do
you
favor
the
continuance
and
strict
enforcement
of
the
eighteenth
amendment
and
volstead
law
b
do
you
favor
a
modification
of
the
volstead
law
to
permit
light
wines
and

do
you
favor
a
repeal
of
the
prohibition
amendment

square
do
you
favor
a
federal
bonus
for
all
american
soldiers
and
sailors
who
wore
the
uniform
during
the
world
war
it
is
important
to
mark
and
return
this
ballot
immediately
every
precaution
was
taken
to
obviate
dishonesty
but
i
suppose
as
there
never
was
an
election
without
trouble
at
the
polls
it
would
be
expecting
too
much
of
human
beings
to
believe
otherwise
so
in
this
solicitation
there
may
have
been
a
few
duplicate
votes
to
swell
the
general
average
one
way
or
the
other
yet
the
had
confidence
in
the
returns
and
through
their
canvass
of
the
various
states
we
have
come
to
see
that
there
are
not
only
and
but
a
third
enormous
party
of
what
we
might
call
by
this
term
is
meant
the
people
who
wish
a
modification
of
the
volstead
act
permitting
the
sale
of
light
wines
and
beer
indeed
this
party
predominated
in
the
final
returns
the
league
has
scorned
the
figures
yet
one
has
a
feeling
that
if
the
showing
had
been
in
favor
of
a
strict
observance
and
upholding
of
the
present
prohibition
law
a
different
attitude
might
have
been
observed
on
its
part
it
is
but
human
after
all
to
wish
the
tide
to
turn
in
the
direction
one
has
spiritedly
advocated
even
the
must
have
been
surprised
at
their
own
brilliant
showing
it
was
in
july
that
the
first
reports
were
made
and
the
was
amazed
when
the
ballots
of
the
first
hundred
thousand
poured
in
those
in
favor
of
a
strict
enforcement
numbered
those
in
favor
of
a
modification
numbered
those
in
favor
of
a
repeal
of
the
prohibition
amendment
numbered
as
to
the
bonus
the
vote
was
almost
even
yes
no
seems
to
predominate
the
said
most
startling
fact
revealed
by
this
first
tally
is
that
the
early
voters
are
against
the
continuance
and
enforcement
of
the
present
prohibition
law
by
the
proportion
of
nearly
two
to
one
on
the
other
hand
the
voters
show
themselves
in
favor
of
the
prohibition
amendment
or
in
other
words
in
favor
of
some
sort
of
a
prohibition
law
by
the
even
larger
ratio
of
to
the
editors
were
exceedingly
fair
in
their
appraisement
of
conditions
they
stated
that
kansas
the
votes
run
for
strict
enforcement
for
modification
and
for
repeal
of
the
amendment
thus
the
prohibitionists
it
is
seen
outnumber
the
combined
and
by
almost
three
to
one
a
situation
that
is
duplicated
in
no
other
state
since
this
early
vote
was
tabulated
a
large
number
of
returns
have
come
in
for
kansas
and
even
though
we
may
be
anticipating
next
report
of
votes
it
may
be
mentioned
that
this
large
vote
is
a
striking
verification
of
the
conditions
indicated
by
the
small
vote
shown
here
kansas
is
for
prohibition
by
approximately
three
to
one
it
is
a
significant
fact
also
that
this
state
has
tried
a
dry
régime
for
a
number
of
years
and
knows
better
than
most
others
how
it
but
here
again
no
thinking
man
it
seems
to
me
has
a
right
to
find
fault
with
a
state
which
wishes
earnestly
to
go
dry
local
option
is
sensible
and
reasonable
a
certain
territory
could
fence
itself
in
as
it
were
guarding
itself
from
a
menace
making
all
the
strict
laws
it
desired
to
protect
its
people
from
what
it
considered
a
tremendous
evil
but
it
has
no
right
to
inflict
its
statutes
upon
its
friendly
neighbors
any
more
than
the
united
states
has
a
right
to
restrict
drinking
on
the
ocean
forbidding
foreign
vessels
to
enter
our
ports
with
cargoes
of
sealed
spirits
it
is

the
that
is
after
votes
had
been
classified
the
editors
asked
for
an
expression
of
opinion
from
william
anderson
state
superintendent
of
the
league
of
new
york
and
president
of
the
allied
citizens
of
america
he
admitted
the
honesty
good
faith
and
fairness
of
the
canvass
but
deemed
it
and
he
went
on
to
say
is
a
clear
and
fundamental
distinction
between
taking
a
poll
on
a
question
which
is
yet
to
be
decided
and
taking
a
poll
on
a
question
which
has
been
decided
in
the
latter
case
the
issue
inevitably
presented
to
many
minds
is
whether
the
law
which
represents
the
decision
shall
be
there
are
millions
of
citizens
who
look
upon
the
eighteenth
amendment
as
cause
for
a
grievance
and
the
first
amendment
states
very
clearly
right
of
the
people
peaceably
to
assemble
and
to
petition
the
government
for
a
redress
of
surely
it
is
no
breach
of
the
peace
to
ask
for
an
expression
from
voters
concerning
a
matter
so
serious
as
prohibition
on
which
they
never
voted
how
else
could
a
clear
comprehension
be
gained
of
the
wishes
of
the
people
save
through
the
press
in
a
country
so
vast
as
ours
naturally
there
would
be
resentment
in
the
dry
camp
at
any
attempt
to
repeal
the
eighteenth
amendment
but
i
hope
there
are
no
americans
who
would
honestly
favor
a
supine
obedience
to
a
law
which
is
abhorrent
to
such
a
number
of
us
intolerance
is
not
a
worthy
sentiment
it
is
a
healthy
sign
when
people
disagree
the
clash
of
minds
leads
to
larger
prospects
of
final
understanding
and
if
it
is
found
in
the
end
that
prohibition
is
ardently
wanted
by
the
majority
we
shall
continue
to
have
prohibition
with
i
trust
a
perfect
carrying
out
of
the
law
the
desire
to
learn
the
truth
is
an
admirable
one
the
advocates
of
volstead
have
nothing
to
fear
from
it
if
they
are
right
and
people
like
myself
are
wrong
then
right
will
prevail
meanwhile
nothing
is
gained
by
cantankerously
bidding
us
behave
ourselves
and
bow
to
the
inevitable
this
is
but
an
added
form
of
prohibition
which
only
serves
to
stir
up
enmities
to
create
further
discords
and
muddle
matters
even
more
your
honest
opinion
and
mine
are
quite
as
valuable
to
the
country
as
that
of
volstead
and
anderson
and
so
the
evidently
thought
for
it
continued
to
publish
returns
as
they
came
flooding
into
the
editorial
office
innumerable
letters
accompanied
the
votes
people
from
all
sections
of
the
country
out
in
meeting
advocating
government
control
of
the
liquor
traffic
from
omaha
and
new
jersey
this
advice
came
and
from
practically
every
state
of
the
union
the
people
were
being
heard
from
the
second
voted
as
follows
for
strict
enforcement
for
modification
for
repeal
a
poll
was
taken
in
many
factories
where
both
men
and
women
are
employed
in
the
edison
works
in
new
jersey
the
poll
was
taken
under
the
supervision
of
charles
edison
saw
to
it
that
the
ballots
were
distributed
one
to
each
worker
they
were
marked
secretly
and
deposited
by
the
individual
workers
in
sealed
ballot
boxes
later
opened
by
representatives
of
the
the
result
shows
a
proportion
of
slightly
more
than
twenty
to
one
against
the
continuation
and
enforcement
of
the
present
liquor
this
is
the
vote
for
enforcement
for
modification
for
repeal
a
careful
poll
of
the
establishment
of
parke
davis
company
manufacturing
chemists
of
detroit
revealed
the
following
results
for
enforcement
for
modification
for
repeal
combining
these
two
polls
the
attitude
of
the
workers
in
two
representative
factories
would
be
summarized
as
follows
for
enforcement
for
modification
for
repeal
in
connection
with
factories
and
labor
one
inevitably
thinks
of
samuel
gompers
the
asked
him
for
an
expression
of
opinion
wishing
to
get
all
sides
of
all
subjects
and
he
sent
this
strong
statement
addition
to
the
vile
and
poisonous
substitution
for
whiskey
so
largely
consumed
and
in
addition
to
the
increased
drug
habit
since
prohibition
prohibition
has
made
a
nation
of
grouches
it
has
taken
the
joy
out
of
the
american
people
as
can
be
attested
by
almost
every
social
gathering
the
whole
scheme
is
unwarrantable
interference
with
the
personal
freedom
of
the
people
and
increases
discontent
and
resentment
in
the
knowledge
that
those
who
have
it
have
it
i
firmly
believe
that
a
modification
of
the
volstead
act
so
that
beer
and
light
wines
may
be
manufactured
and
sold
under
proper
regulations
would
solve
the
whole
question
rationally
and
the
discontent
of
the
worker
is
something
to
be
considered
even
by
fanatics
who
would
rule
us
by
force
and
seek
to
restrain
too
thoroughly
natural
appetites
one
must
take
into
account
the
wishes
of
that
vast
army
who
do
the
drudgery
of
the
world
and
it
does
not
require
an
immense
amount
of
imagination
to
understand
what
the
years
may
bring
if
there
is
an
apparent
stolid
indifference
now
in
the
realms
of
labor
the
poll
would
seem
to
contradict
any
such
belief
that
the
workingman
is
beginning
to
realize
that
a
distinct
form
of
class
legislation
has
taken
place
there
can
be
no
doubt
i
think
the
authorities
would
never
dare
to
encroach
upon
a
rights
in
the
matter
of
home
brew
yet
they
must
be
aware
that
deprived
of
his
only
club
the
corner
saloon
the
workingman
who
still
desires
a
glass
of
beer
occasionally
is
methodically
producing
it
against
the
law
to
the
devil
with
the
law
says
the
day
laborer
when
the
rich
disobey
it
every
hour
of
their
lives
another
factory
which
employs
women
was
also
canvassed
this
was
the
establishment
of
the
soup
company
in
new
jersey
approximately
per
cent
of
the
workers
polled
were
women
yet
the
vote
is
against
the
present
laws
by
a
proportion
of
to
this
is
how
the
voting
ran
for
enforcement
for
modification
for
repeal
but
the
final
figures
are
the
most
interesting
of
all
a
summary
of
ballots
revealed
this
result
which
must
have
proved
disheartening
to
the
league
of
ballots
on
main
poll
poll
factory
polls
totals
is
it
necessary
for
anyone
to
say
anything
further
about
the
temper
of
the
country
facts
are
facts
to
repeat
what
my
friend
in
omaha
said
was
all
right
until
we
got
it
chapter
xvi
literature
and
prohibition
the
philosopher
has
recently
been
traveling
over
the
country
as
far
west
as
the
coast
he
had
heard
that
conditions
so
far
as
prohibition
was
concerned
were
excellent
out
there
but
he
wished
to
observe
for
himself
he
found
them
quite
the
contrary
in
states
like
oregon
and
washington
which
went
dry
long
before
national
prohibition
became
an
established
fact
the
people
were
obtaining
anything
they
desired
close
to
the
border
there
is
plenty
of
bootlegging
endless
daring
adventuring
in
the
liquor
traffic
many
a
bold
plunge
over
the
line
to
bring
whiskey
and
gin
into
united
states
territory
and
they
certainly
bring
it
meanwhile
the
propaganda
of
the
puritans
goes
on
or
rather
the
impropaganda
for
it
is
not
true
that
people
are
behaving
themselves
there
is
just
as
much
discontent
and
disorder
among
westerners
as
among
easterners
so
the
philosopher
observed
but
in
cities
like
omaha
which
is
about
in
the
center
of
the
country
there
is
a
dryness
which
is
depressing
passing
through
a
hotel
corridor
one
day
at
noon
the
philosopher
heard
male
voices
chanting
in
unison
he
stepped
to
the
open
door
of
a
private
and
was
much
amused
to
see
a
group
of
forty
or
fifty
solid
business
men
all
wearing
little
badges
proclaiming
their
allegiance
to
some
organization
or
other
standing
about
the
tables
lifting
high
their
glasses
of
water
and
shouting
these
words
the
on
the
and
a
good
song
clear
there
was
a
desperate
attempt
at
gaiety
a
look
in
the
eye
of
each
prospective
luncheoner
which
seemed
to
say
have
a
good
time
in
spite
of
prohibition
but
my
friend
turned
away
at
this
travesty
on
mirth
and
good
fellowship
he
wondered
if
richard
hovey
was
not
turning
in
his
grave
at
the
cruel
editing
of
his
deathless
song
and
he
counted
it
a
pity
that
pewter
mugs
had
been
superseded
by
goblets
and
he
saw
that
gopher
prairie
was
indeed
a
dreadful
reality
not
that
he
would
have
wished
to
see
the
law
disobeyed
he
merely
deprecated
the
tragic
fact
that
this
was
the
pass
we
had
come
to
this
was
the
drab
social
order
we
had
definitely
arrived
at
he
went
disconsolately
down
the
hallway
brooding
of
all
those
ancient
poets
who
had
held
it
no
shame
to
sing
of
the
vine
and
the
flowing
bowl
no
one
had
ever
written
a
song
in
praise
of
food
and
he
thought
if
hovey
could
be
edited
soon
the
bible
itself
would
hear
the
of
the
shears
as
certain
boisterous
passages
were
cut
out
and
as
for
poor
old
omar
he
wondered
how
soon
it
would
be
before
he
was
paraphrased
by
the
reformers
somewhat
in
this
manner
here
with
a
little
bread
beneath
the
bough
a
flask
of
milk
a
book
of
verse
and
thou
beside
me
singing
in
the
wilderness
ah
paradise
were
wilderness
enow
and
of
course
quatrains
like
this
would
soon
be
omitted
from
all
editions
why
be
this
juice
the
growth
of
god
who
dare
blaspheme
the
twisted
tendril
as
a
snare
a
blessing
we
should
use
it
should
we
not
and
if
a
curse
why
then
who
set
it
there
the
story
of
the
marriage
feast
at
cana
must
make
sorry
reading
for
any
prohibitionist
and
the
philosopher
doubts
not
that
it
will
be
torn
from
the
records
in
years
to
come
we
shall
not
even
be
given
the
pleasure
of
reading
about
the
jubilations
of
vanished
times
times
rich
in
banquets
think
of
imperial
rome
without
golden
goblets
they
were
as
much
a
part
of
the
feast
as
the
fruit
and
the
lights
and
if
we
are
to
be
deprived
of
the
vicarious
joy
of
dipping
into
the
pagan
past
might
we
not
just
as
well
renounce
life
entirely
red
wine
will
be
as
antiquated
as
the
ermine
and
crowns
of
kings
my
friend
believes
yet
who
can
deny
the
picturesqueness
of
the
scepter
and
the
court
fool
they
may
not
have
been
important
but
they
gave
a
glamour
to
dreary
days
some
of
us
may
prefer
them
says
the
philosopher
the
collars
of
stupid
senators
and
there
is
an
old
song
of
abraham
written
somewhere
between
and
which
must
give
pain
to
any
prohibitionist
will
they
strive
to
bowdlerize
the
anthologies
erase
from
literature
so
true
and
human
a
poem
as
this
which
voices
a
thought
almost
as
old
as
the
world
it
is
after
anacreon
the
thirsty
earth
soaks
up
the
rain
and
drinks
and
gapes
for
drink
again
the
plants
suck
in
the
earth
and
are
with
constant
drinking
fresh
and
fair
the
sea
itself
which
one
would
think
should
have
but
little
need
of
drink
drinks
twice
ten
thousand
rivers
up
so
filled
that
they
the
cup
the
busy
sun
and
one
would
guess
drunken
fiery
face
no
less
drinks
up
the
sea
and
when
done
the
moon
and
stars
drink
up
the
sun
they
drink
and
dance
by
their
own
light
they
drink
and
revel
all
the
night
nothing
in
sober
found
but
an
eternal
goes
round
fill
up
the
bowl
then
fill
it
high
fill
all
the
glasses
there
for
why
should
every
creature
drink
but
i
why
men
of
morals
tell
me
why
think
of
losing
from
english
literature
lines
like
these
from
the
of
housman
could
man
be
drunk
forever
with
liquor
love
or
fights
lief
should
i
rouse
at
morning
and
lief
lie
down
at
nights
but
men
at
whiles
are
sober
and
think
by
fits
and
starts
and
if
they
think
they
fasten
their
hands
upon
their
hearts
and
so
modern
and
exquisite
a
poet
as
richard
le
gallienne
has
had
much
to
say
metrically
of
the
follies
of
attempting
to
regulate
by
law
the
natural
appetites
of
man
he
sounds
a
warning
in
this
ballade
spurning
the
reformers
they
took
away
your
drink
from
you
the
kind
old
humanizing
glass
soon
they
will
take
tobacco
too
and
next
take
our
say
bill
will
never
pass
nor
this
my
warning
word
disdain
you
said
it
once
you
silly
ass
make
the
same
mistake
again
we
know
them
now
the
bloodless
crew
we
know
them
all
too
well
alas
nothing
that
they
do
to
make
the
world
a
bible
class
though
against
bottled
beer
or
bass
i
search
the
sacred
text
in
vain
to
find
a
whisper
by
the
mass
make
the
same
mistake
again
beware
these
legislators
blue
pouring
their
moral
on
all
the
joys
our
fathers
knew
the
very
flowers
in
the
grass
are
safe
no
more
and
lad
and
lass
the
old
and
the
cane
here
comes
our
modern
hudibras
make
the
same
mistake
again
envoi
prince
vanished
is
the
rail
of
brass
so
mark
me
well
and
my
refrain
tobacco
next
you
silly
ass
make
the
same
mistake
again
it
would
be
sad
indeed
to
lose
such
a
song
as
to
me
only
with
thine
eyes
how
much
poorer
the
garden
of
poetry
would
be
without
such
bibulous
planters
of
rhyme
as
burns
and
poe
and
verlaine
i
suppose
the
paid
puritans
would
have
even
our
poets
walk
the
humdrum
way
so
that
we
would
have
no
news
of
life
from
taverns
and
inns
the
picturesque
vagabond
the
rapscallion
son
of
song
must
be
pulled
in
from
the
pleasant
highways
and
made
to
conform
to
what
a
flat
with
kitchenette
and
running
water
and
a
desk
downtown
with
methodical
rides
on
a
heaving
subway
train
at
eight
in
the
morning
and
again
at
six
in
the
evening
well
there
are
other
modes
of
living
that
seem
a
trifle
sweeter
to
the
dreamers
of
dreams
the
makers
of
beauty
art
is
not
produced
like
so
many
bricks
or
like
so
many
waffles
in
a
waffle
iron
it
is
shot
with
wonder
and
just
as
the
emerges
in
its
white
perfection
from
dubious
slimy
stems
so
a
great
work
of
loveliness
may
sometimes
rise
from
the
meanest
sources
that
is
what
your
pharisee
does
not
and
can
not
understand
he
would
cast
us
all
into
one
stew
us
all
in
the
same
juice
and
bid
us
all
conform
to
some
stupid
which
he
has
the
effrontery
to
hold
before
the
artist
as
the
ultimate
goodness
chapter
xvii
america
today
my
friend
the
philosopher
is
worried
about
america
he
sees
a
drift
toward
puritanism
with
the
hood
of
hypocrisy
used
as
a
general
covering
he
knows
a
distinguished
judge
who
recently
sentenced
a
little
bootlegger
to
thirty
days
in
jail
and
excoriated
him
in
the
with
all
the
power
of
language
at
his
command
then
he
dismissed
court
for
the
day
as
he
had
an
important
social
engagement
uptown
on
the
way
he
suggested
to
the
philosopher
that
they
drop
in
at
a
smart
club
he
was
very
weary
after
his
heavy
work
and
needed
a
bracer
he
got
it
on
an
evening
a
little
later
this
same
personage
a
man
greatly
respected
in
his
community
whose
utterances
on
civic
affairs
are
often
quoted
in
the
papers
attended
a
dinner
at
one
of
the
big
hotels
many
eminent
jurists
and
publicists
were
gathered
together
to
do
honor
to
one
of
their
number
a
little
bar
with
a
man
in
a
neat
white
jacket
in
charge
had
been
set
up
in
a
room
not
too
remote
from
the
and
thither
the
great
men
repaired
to
refresh
themselves
after
the
arduous
duty
of
imposing
fines
and
prison
sentences
on
ruffians
who
dispensed
alcohol
through
the
city
to
those
who
like
the
great
men
could
pay
for
it
but
not
lest
ye
be
and
the
philosopher
told
me
that
once
he
stood
in
the
private
office
of
a
lawyer
when
the
telephone
bell
rang
he
could
not
help
hearing
the
conversation
which
ran
somewhat
like
this
that
you
pete
a
dozen
cases
of
the
same
know
tonight
if
possible
try
to
get
it
there
same
price
of
course
without
fail
and
i
have
a
friend
who
wants
to
see
you
the
address
sherman
call
him
up
all
right
the
philosopher
has
himself
told
me
that
he
has
no
scruples
about
disobeying
the
liquor
law
yet
somehow
it
gave
him
no
little
pain
to
listen
to
this
monologue
uttered
by
one
whose
life
is
given
to
forensic
pleadings
whose
maledictions
pour
forth
in
cataracts
of
eloquence
when
some
shuddering
nobody
stands
at
the
bar
of
justice
it
is
as
though
a
priest
left
the
altar
to
abscond
immediately
after
a
sermon
on
the
duties
of
christians
in
a
far
western
state
my
friend
saw
the
governor
take
many
highballs
during
and
after
a
banquet
in
a
public
room
he
saw
the
mayor
of
the
city
do
likewise
and
he
was
conscious
that
a
gentleman
of
the
cloth
was
slowly
but
surely
growing
unconscious
as
the
dinner
went
on
its
merry
way
he
had
never
before
seen
this
happen
he
was
told
by
a
fellow
traveler
whose
word
he
could
not
doubt
that
all
but
per
cent
of
the
legislature
of
another
western
state
went
out
and
got
beastly
drunk
after
they
had
voted
for
prohibition
he
has
heard
the
jibes
that
foreigners
seeing
what
he
has
seen
fling
at
us
every
day
and
he
has
had
no
answer
to
give
them
he
has
come
upon
boys
trying
to
open
the
lockers
in
country
clubs
not
little
rowdies
but
the
sons
of
influential
members
that
they
might
steal
some
of
the
old
whiskey
they
have
boasted
of
their
attempted
and
successful
thefts
he
has
seen
flappers
disgustingly
intoxicated
he
has
observed
them
putting
their
hands
up
to
the
of
their
boy
companions
to
see
if
a
flask
was
there
alas
it
was
as
limousines
and
taxis
have
flashed
by
him
he
has
caught
glimpses
of
youngsters
who
five
years
ago
would
not
have
been
allowed
to
go
out
without
a
chaperone
in
such
close
proximity
that
for
a
moment
he
thought
it
was
but
one
strange
enigmatic
form
in
the
car
he
has
seen
college
boys
in
groups
of
three
and
four
disappear
into
a
small
compartment
on
a
train
and
emerge
ten
minutes
later
with
downcast
eyes
and
sheepish
grins
flushed
with
liquor
and
he
has
seen
the
same
boys
repeat
the
proceeding
ten
or
a
dozen
times
on
a
journey
lasting
but
a
couple
of
hours
he
has
seen
a
woman
injured
in
the
streets
of
one
of
our
big
cities
lying
almost
unconscious
a
hotel
was
close
by
and
a
doctor
in
the
crowd
suggested
that
someone
rush
to
get
some
brandy
the
man
who
volunteered
to
go
came
back
without
any
none
was
available
nor
could
the
proprietor
be
induced
to
send
any
out
even
if
he
had
had
it
he
was
suspicious
of
a
stranger
making
such
a
request
he
was
suspicious
of
everybody
police
in
civilian
clothes
oh
they
were
all
too
common
these
days
that
he
knew
and
no
one
was
going
to
catch
even
though
a
wounded
woman
lay
prone
and
groaning
at
his
door
he
has
heard
the
social
service
worker
in
a
new
york
hospital
say
that
while
conditions
had
slightly
improved
during
the
first
few
months
of
prohibition
they
were
now
worse
than
ever
in
the
old
days
a
workingman
spent
say
on
grog
out
of
his
weekly
wages
and
was
content
to
let
it
go
at
that
now
he
spends
ten
and
twelve
dollars
get
his
liquor
at
any
cost
and
the
wives
and
families
of
such
men
are
in
despair
with
the
passing
of
time
the
people
have
learned
how
to
get
drinks
and
how
to
make
them
and
they
are
becoming
more
expert
every
day
but
they
drink
poison
anything
they
can
lay
their
hands
upon
and
become
all
but
raving
maniacs
for
a
while
he
has
seen
form
letters
from
bootleggers
in
new
york
giving
price
lists
just
as
though
there
were
no
law
forbidding
such
transactions
deliveries
were
promised
within
the
city
at
rates
commensurately
low
it
was
even
stated
that
were
going
down
and
that
the
best
gin
could
be
obtained
as
well
as
other
materials
of
alcoholic
content
a
printed
address
was
given
and
the
mails
were
boldly
used
for
this
questionable
business
he
has
known
friends
who
had
been
on
the
water
wagon
for
years
to
take
to
as
a
natural
course
their
excuse
was
that
they
could
not
afford
the
prices
asked
by
professional
bootleggers
and
they
were
certain
that
they
could
not
possibly
give
a
dinner
party
now
of
all
times
without
offering
some
stimulant
to
their
guests
in
the
old
days
they
would
have
ventured
to
do
so
since
prohibition
people
expected
and
usually
received
plenty
of
wet
refreshment
they
did
not
care
to
be
segregated
from
their
acquaintances
they
did
not
relish
the
idea
of
having
their
invitations
refused
so
they
gladly
became
and
swiftly
acquired
skill
in
the
preparation
of
all
sorts
of
wines
gin
and
beer
he
has
seen
in
a
southern
city
the
wife
of
a
leading
judge
serving
a
punch
made
of
apple
juice
and
peach
juice
oh
a
very
heady
punch
indeed
to
state
officials
who
had
no
qualms
about
accepting
it
though
they
were
aware
that
the
law
was
being
broken
and
he
saw
young
men
made
quite
tight
on
this
same
punch
he
has
observed
people
entering
a
restaurant
in
new
york
with
packages
which
obviously
contained
bottles
these
under
the
eye
of
a
policeman
in
uniform
were
taken
from
them
by
the
employees
of
the
hotel
one
a
bottle
of
champagne
was
poured
into
a
great
pitcher
the
customers
were
graciously
permitted
to
watch
the
process
in
a
private
room
and
then
served
openly
again
under
the
eye
and
nose
in
the
main
dining
room
so
twisted
has
become
our
legal
logic
that
it
seems
it
is
one
thing
to
drink
from
a
bottle
and
quite
another
to
drink
from
a
pitcher
a
nation
of
sophists
as
well
as
hypocrites
he
has
seen
motors
searched
on
public
highways
without
a
warrant
and
he
has
known
innocent
occupants
of
the
car
to
be
told
that
could
go
on
the
police
had
nothing
on
he
entered
a
small
police
station
in
california
with
a
friend
who
had
lost
a
valuable
cigarette
case
a
friend
of
distinction
the
officers
instantly
recognized
him
opened
a
desk
exposing
dozens
of
quarts
of
whiskey
and
offered
both
the
philosopher
and
his
friend
a
drink
these
officers
were
quite
drunk
they
laughingly
told
the
complainant
that
they
had
just
a
roadhouse
and
were
going
to
sell
to
another
roadhouse
the
stock
which
they
did
not
consume
and
the
second
man
in
due
season
taking
the
graft
which
would
come
out
of
his
profit
he
remembers
the
case
in
the
state
of
new
york
no
doubt
others
have
forgotten
it
as
they
forget
much
that
they
should
remember
of
an
innocent
farmer
driving
his
motor
through
the
countryside
one
day
at
dusk
he
was
ordered
to
stop
by
an
officer
who
suddenly
appeared
on
the
road
and
when
he
refused
to
do
so
he
was
instantly
shot
senator
wadsworth
aired
this
frightful
incident
in
the
senate
and
the
chief
prohibition
enforcement
officer
of
the
state
announced
that
it
was
the
duty
of
automobilists
to
halt
when
they
were
ordered
to
do
so
or
they
might
suffer
a
like
fate
he
has
seen
in
many
a
club
bottles
of
liquor
smuggled
in
cocktails
made
by
the
employees
and
served
in
private
rooms
then
because
it
was
strictly
against
the
rules
to
drink
openly
like
cats
who
had
just
stolen
the
cream
the
ladies
and
their
men
guests
walked
guiltily
but
airily
into
the
dining
room
imagining
that
there
were
no
evidences
of
their
the
neat
little
leather
or
silver
cases
which
contained
the
forbidden
alcohol
were
automatically
returned
to
their
owners
who
in
turn
handed
them
to
their
waiting
chauffeurs
the
latter
of
course
were
omitted
from
the
happy
function
and
were
taken
home
to
be
replenished
at
the
next
gathering
he
has
known
an
old
lady
very
ill
who
craved
as
she
had
never
craved
anything
a
single
glass
of
champagne
but
even
her
druggist
could
not
get
it
for
her
at
any
price
on
a
prescription
and
she
was
denied
the
exhilaration
of
this
simple
luxury
in
order
so
my
friend
supposes
that
some
worthless
drunkard
who
might
better
be
under
the
sod
should
be
saved
indeed
he
has
known
many
an
invalid
who
might
have
gone
to
his
grave
a
bit
happier
for
some
momentary
stimulant
which
stupid
reformers
saw
fit
to
withhold
he
was
told
by
the
proprietor
of
several
supper
places
in
one
of
our
great
cities
and
he
can
not
doubt
his
word
since
he
has
known
him
for
a
long
long
time
that
one
of
the
federal
prohibition
officers
who
live
on
graft
receives
not
less
than
five
dollars
for
every
case
of
wine
which
passes
the
customs
very
swiftly
this
official
is
growing
unbelievably
rich
he
does
not
wish
naturally
to
see
a
return
to
what
might
now
be
considered
the
old
calm
days
not
long
ago
this
grafter
decided
that
it
was
about
time
to
make
a
spectacular
and
close
up
for
a
while
the
cabarets
along
the
route
where
he
acted
as
supreme
czar
for
washington
might
take
his
long
inaction
as
neglect
of
duty
therefore
he
set
a
night
when
he
visited
various
restaurants
in
a
limousine
warning
the
proprietors
that
they
must
shut
down
but
he
added
in
the
ear
of
each
worry
this
is
only
a
bluff
a
spectacular
gesture
all
be
free
to
sell
stuff
in
a
little
he
meant
that
phrase
little
while
for
of
course
his
graft
ceased
during
the
interval
of
grayness
but
the
federal
government
getting
his
report
seemed
pleased
at
his
attention
to
his
duties
and
all
was
serene
for
him
champagne
was
purchased
soon
afterwards
in
all
these
cabarets
and
the
jazz
struck
up
a
livelier
tune
and
everybody
was
happy
he
has
read
with
astonishment
that
the
body
in
several
of
our
colleges
has
found
it
necessary
to
take
formal
action
for
the
suppression
of
intoxication
among
was
this
ever
done
in
good
old
think
of
it
your
boy
whom
the
volstead
act
was
to
protect
from
the
scandal
of
drunkenness
must
have
what
is
comparable
to
the
act
and
the
hobert
act
pressed
upon
him
in
his
college
so
that
he
may
be
made
to
see
the
dangers
that
lurk
in
alcohol
the
great
and
holy
government
can
not
control
him
a
minor
form
of
tyranny
and
suppression
must
come
into
existence
to
aid
the
already
heavy
machinery
of
the
law
to
run
smoothly
he
has
known
of
an
exalted
judge
who
purchased
liquor
from
a
police
officer
had
it
delivered
at
his
door
in
a
patrol
wagon
and
that
wagon
was
guarded
by
a
man
in
uniform
he
has
known
another
minion
of
the
law
who
admitted
that
though
he
had
not
violated
the
volstead
act
for
conscientious
reasons
had
never
so
much
as
had
a
case
of
whiskey
or
beer
carted
to
his
door
he
had
somehow
a
bottle
or
two
in
his
home
left
there
by
sympathetic
friends
he
supposed
yet
he
did
not
inquire
doth
make
cowards
of
us
all
as
said
but
how
one
absolves
himself
is
a
matter
of
private
concern
rationalism
could
go
no
further
than
this
processes
of
reasoning
strange
indeed
are
the
ways
of
powerful
public
officials
obeying
one
law
to
the
letter
and
letting
their
ethics
slip
and
slide
when
it
comes
to
some
other
law
which
they
do
not
really
wish
to
keep
and
do
not
really
wish
to
break
he
has
heard
a
dapper
young
society
man
in
massachusetts
glibly
state
that
the
best
bootlegger
in
his
town
is
a
federal
prohibition
officer
who
can
him
anything
he
wants
from
beer
to
whiskey
and
and
the
dapper
young
man
thought
this
was
all
right
and
rather
good
to
know
in
these
arid
moreover
one
was
perfectly
certain
that
what
one
purchased
from
this
scoundrel
was
the
real
thing
no
chance
of
blindness
or
anything
of
that
sort
you
will
notice
that
what
the
philosopher
has
seen
is
not
confined
to
any
one
section
of
the
country
he
has
traveled
considerably
to
make
his
observations
this
is
the
america
of
today
as
the
philosopher
sees
it
he
says
he
is
not
so
worried
about
the
present
generation
as
about
the
generation
that
may
come
after
it
surely
the
potential
mothers
and
fathers
of
children
a
decade
hence
are
not
fit
to
take
upon
themselves
the
responsibilities
and
burdens
of
parenthood
what
kind
of
offspring
will
they
produce
so
long
as
we
are
looking
ahead
providing
for
the
welfare
of
the
race
to
be
let
us
wisely
look
far
enough
ahead
so
that
our
eugenics
may
mean
something
it
is
folly
to
pretend
to
be
altruistic
to
dip
into
the
immediate
future
at
the
expense
of
the
present
we
will
produce
a
decadent
race
if
we
are
not
careful
do
you
like
this
america
of
today
the
philosopher
says
frankly
that
he
does
not
neither
do
i
and
neither
do
you
if
you
are
a
good
american
and
what
about
the
america
of
tomorrow
chapter
xviii
other
reforms
when
books
of
the
quality
of
can
be
suppressed
happily
this
romance
of
james
branch
cabell
has
been
restored
to
the
libraries
and
of
the
land
we
are
facing
a
dangerous
precedent
was
likewise
censored
but
the
vice
society
might
be
about
better
business
i
could
name
a
dozen
volumes
which
they
have
stupidly
imagined
should
be
withdrawn
from
circulation
but
it
would
be
merely
an
idle
repetition
the
principle
remains
the
same
publishers
and
authors
have
become
frightened
if
the
realm
of
art
is
to
be
invaded
by
reformers
who
fail
to
distinguish
between
beauty
and
filth
it
is
that
there
will
be
precious
little
art
in
america
in
the
next
hundred
years
the
pictures
that
we
hang
upon
our
walls
may
be
torn
down
next
and
the
passion
for
dreariness
may
cause
the
entire
united
states
to
become
one
sad
sahara
of
utilitarianism
with
no
gleam
of
loveliness
the
mania
for
standardizing
us
is
growing
it
is
strange
that
the
authorities
do
not
pounce
upon
a
play
like
lest
it
put
false
notions
into
the
minds
of
the
simple
people
there
is
a
tremendous
lesson
in
that
drama
crush
us
too
much
make
too
many
automatons
and
one
day
the
lifeless
bloodless
unimaginative
host
may
rise
in
sudden
might
and
defeat
the
very
purpose
of
their
masters
the
easy
triumph
of
prohibition
gives
the
reformer
little
to
do
save
to
seek
other
avenues
of
sadistic
expression
if
we
are
to
be
dictated
to
as
to
which
books
we
shall
read
we
will
find
a
way
to
discover
smut
and
nothing
but
smut
just
as
we
have
found
synthetic
gin
and
if
the
lifting
of
an
elbow
a
necessary
gesture
when
one
takes
an
drink
got
on
a
nerves
i
can
not
think
that
the
smoke
curling
from
your
cigarette
and
mine
gives
him
anything
but
pain
and
genuine
anguish
of
mind
tobacco
companies
are
worried
and
some
of
them
have
been
spending
vast
sums
to
offset
the
crusade
against
the
weed
meanwhile
the
american
says
of
course
they
did
put
prohibition
over
on
us
but
oh
they
would
not
dare
rob
us
of
our
cheroots
we
simply
stand
for
but
i
am
afraid
that
we
are
as
spineless
as
ever
when
meetings
are
organized
to
protest
against
the
reformers
they
are
often
ill
attended
a
dash
of
rain
dampens
the
ardor
of
the
lackadaisical
citizen
who
prefers
his
own
fireside
to
speeches
that
hit
hard
at
this
and
that
false
cause
the
trouble
is
that
the
fanatics
have
not
made
things
quite
hard
enough
for
us
if
there
were
a
real
lack
of
liquor
if
complete
drouth
settled
down
over
the
land
we
might
rise
in
a
great
body
and
speak
what
we
inwardly
feel
but
most
of
us
are
too
lazy
to
fight
back
meanwhile
the
organized
minority
gird
on
their
armor
devising
ways
and
means
to
torture
us
further
and
in
slippered
comfort
we
sip
our
home
brew
or
our
dearly
bought
bootleg
toddies
and
decide
that
the
effort
required
to
get
together
is
too
great
we
will
let
things
drift
there
must
come
a
change
and
after
all
so
long
as
prohibition
really
succeeded
the
use
of
worrying
the
reformer
knows
this
characteristic
lethargy
of
the
american
people
and
he
smiles
assembles
his
cohorts
calls
us
in
the
vernacular
of
the
day
marks
and
proceeds
with
his
reforming
the
return
of
blue
laws
is
not
improbable
a
few
towns
have
already
adopted
them
and
in
these
movies
are
not
tolerated
on
the
sabbath
newspapers
are
not
allowed
to
be
sold
even
the
trolley
cars
are
stopped
a
man
may
be
arrested
for
painting
his
roof
on
sunday
and
as
for
a
game
of
baseball
on
that
day
it
is
unthinkable
in
many
a
community
one
may
not
walk
except
to
church
the
puritan
spirit
is
not
dead
it
lives
in
many
a
hamlet
dreary
enough
under
the
best
conditions
the
american
people
have
come
to
a
point
where
it
is
a
matter
of
living
or
existing
for
my
own
part
i
am
perfectly
willing
for
the
of
this
country
to
do
as
they
please
all
i
ask
is
that
they
let
me
alone
as
i
certainly
shall
let
them
alone
i
have
said
elsewhere
that
i
firmly
believe
in
local
option
that
is
because
perhaps
i
think
that
contrast
is
the
greatest
thing
in
art
and
in
life
i
have
never
cared
for
regions
of
perpetual
sunshine
just
as
i
have
never
cared
for
localities
where
it
rains
seemingly
forever
give
me
a
little
of
each
the
gopher
prairieite
must
feel
an
impulse
to
see
a
metropolis
now
and
then
just
as
we
who
live
in
tremendous
cities
feel
the
urge
every
so
often
to
seek
the
stillness
of
the
woods
it
so
happens
that
a
few
people
nay
a
great
many
prefer
to
hive
in
cities
because
there
they
find
a
certain
amount
of
culture
they
like
the
opera
and
good
plays
well
acted
the
sparkle
which
city
life
gives
to
them
they
like
dining
out
in
restaurants
and
they
happen
to
care
for
the
jeweled
beauty
of
say
fifth
avenue
or
michigan
avenue
on
a
winter
evening
the
monotony
of
the
life
of
a
kansas
farmer
does
not
appeal
to
them
they
can
scarcely
understand
that
passion
for
seclusion
which
he
craves
but
they
find
no
fault
with
his
mode
of
living
they
even
look
with
a
sort
of
amused
tolerance
upon
those
curious
beings
who
sneer
at
women
who
smoke
cigarettes
they
know
perfectly
well
that
there
are
many
virtuous
women
who
smoke
cigarettes
and
it
is
difficult
to
understand
why
everyone
can
not
be
possessed
of
the
same
knowledge
but
they
do
not
seek
to
impose
their
beliefs
upon
others
they
do
no
proselytizing
they
are
not
anxious
to
convert
people
to
a
way
of
thinking
and
reasoning
that
seems
to
them
simple
and
natural
they
understand
that
what
is
one
meat
is
another
poison
but
they
do
resent
being
told
that
what
they
consume
as
meat
should
be
labeled
poison
by
someone
who
has
never
tasted
it
the
eighteenth
amendment
tells
us
practically
that
it
is
wrong
to
drink
you
and
i
know
that
it
is
not
wrong
to
drink
but
we
do
know
full
well
without
being
told
that
it
is
very
wrong
to
get
drunk
in
kansas
the
people
are
told
that
it
is
wrong
to
smoke
whereas
anyone
at
all
knows
that
it
is
in
no
wise
wrong
to
smoke
but
it
is
exceedingly
wrong
to
until
nerves
become
shattered
and
hands
tremble
the
reformer
seeing
only
the
ill
effects
upon
those
who
overdo
anything
and
refusing
to
note
the
normal
lives
of
those
of
us
who
never
overdo
anything
can
not
differentiate
hence
the
hullabaloo
the
trouble
the
mess
the
world
is
in
today
reformers
you
see
lack
discrimination
one
might
as
well
deplore
niagara
falls
because
a
few
fools
plunge
into
its
roaring
torrents
cease
to
enjoy
its
beauty
because
suicides
have
taken
advantage
of
its
power
and
height
to
hurl
themselves
into
eternity
one
might
as
well
say
that
no
more
skyscrapers
are
to
be
built
simply
because
now
and
then
a
man
leaps
from
the
top
of
one
and
makes
a
ghastly
mess
of
himself
on
the
pavement
below
robert
louis
stevenson
used
to
say
that
the
little
superfluities
of
life
were
what
made
it
lovely
yes
and
bearable
living
does
not
consist
in
a
mere
drab
drudgery
from
day
to
day
proving
oneself
turning
out
in
orderly
fashion
so
many
mechanical
instruments
with
no
release
from
humdrum
life
must
contain
zest
and
ardor
and
variety
that
zest
and
ardor
and
variety
we
human
beings
ourselves
give
or
bring
to
it
there
must
be
a
garnishing
of
the
dish
of
existence
once
in
a
while
we
can
not
have
our
days
served
up
monotonously
on
a
dull
platter
see
them
flung
upon
the
banquet
table
without
a
surrounding
decoration
of
loveliness
ugliness
must
be
hidden
and
sane
fun
must
play
its
part
in
the
scheme
of
things
now
it
is
obvious
that
drunkenness
is
a
form
of
bestial
ugliness
and
should
never
be
encouraged
even
we
who
are
not
professional
reformers
recognize
that
but
the
right
kind
of
mild
drinking
the
drinking
of
wines
which
helps
digestion
by
giving
the
proper
spur
to
the
gastric
juices
is
a
salutary
habit
and
does
no
one
any
harm
in
france
i
have
never
seen
anyone
intoxicated
except
a
visiting
american
and
i
fear
with
prohibition
that
more
than
ever
will
the
cafés
and
streets
of
paris
be
littered
with
shameful
and
shameless
fellow
countrymen
of
mine
the
french
learn
from
childhood
how
to
drink
and
a
picture
in
a
recent
parisian
journal
showed
a
group
of
three
generations
of
chosen
at
hazard
from
among
many
others
i
never
looked
upon
sturdier
representatives
of
what
some
of
our
forlorn
would
doubtless
call
a
people
alcoholism
is
practically
unknown
among
the
latin
races
to
go
over
the
border
into
a
sodden
state
of
imbecility
is
unthinkable
to
them
france
got
rid
of
absinthe
when
she
realized
the
danger
of
that
fiery
liquid
she
did
not
have
to
close
up
and
seal
and
nail
down
every
café
in
every
city
and
hamlet
just
because
a
handful
of
ribald
artists
thought
it
smart
to
sit
all
afternoon
and
dream
dreams
of
pink
elephants
and
the
instant
absinthe
became
unlawful
the
french
obeyed
the
edict
accepted
the
truth
that
a
menace
had
been
removed
and
went
on
consuming
an
occasional
aperitif
and
light
wines
never
cocktails
and
highballs
but
the
american
people
through
their
reformers
always
have
to
go
to
extremes
we
could
not
see
the
wisdom
of
cutting
out
or
controlling
hard
drinking
we
had
to
slam
every
door
of
every
saloon
and
not
content
with
that
we
had
to
the
entire
country
or
ridiculously
try
to
do
so
until
there
should
be
no
drop
of
beer
even
on
premises
then
the
moment
we
had
done
that
we
forthwith
craved
a
little
liquor
because
we
get
it
humanly
enough
we
were
sorry
that
we
had
been
so
rash
true
we
had
rid
ourselves
of
one
of
the
most
abhorrent
evidences
of
our
civilization
the
saloon
with
the
but
in
doing
so
we
had
destroyed
or
attempted
to
destroy
the
harmless
pleasure
of
men
and
women
who
had
never
entered
a
saloon
we
punished
everybody
in
order
to
punish
a
few
this
was
not
the
right
process
the
folly
of
our
reformers
is
working
incalculable
harm
to
the
entire
country
and
the
end
is
not
yet
chapter
xix
is
europe
going
dry
if
william
otherwise
known
as
johnson
has
his
way
europe
too
will
know
the
great
drouth
it
is
something
to
have
lost
eye
in
a
cause
and
still
to
retain
nerve
and
enthusiasm
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
liquor
interests
in
great
britain
have
become
frightened
just
as
the
tobacco
interests
have
become
alarmed
here
and
there
are
rumors
of
large
sums
being
spent
to
contravert
the
propaganda
of
the
temperance
advocates
in
england
lady
astor
has
come
out
strong
for
prohibition
the
london
is
a
notoriously
shocking
place
in
the
meanest
sections
of
the
city
i
have
witnessed
scenes
which
made
one
realize
that
dickens
did
not
exaggerate
when
he
drew
a
character
like
i
have
seen
thinly
clad
anemic
children
waiting
on
the
steps
of
a
public
house
for
not
only
their
fathers
but
their
mothers
to
emerge
and
when
they
finally
did
so
they
were
so
drunk
that
they
could
scarcely
toddle
to
their
wretched
homes
the
british
could
find
a
way
to
shut
up
these
disreputable
resorts
without
interfering
with
the
liberty
of
that
portion
of
the
population
which
knows
how
to
drink
in
moderation
during
the
war
and
long
after
it
the
hours
were
rigidly
regulated
with
respect
to
bars
one
could
not
obtain
a
drink
until
noon
then
the
bars
were
tightly
closed
again
at
and
not
reopened
until
closing
again
at
there
was
little
disorder
less
drunkenness
than
ever
before
in
the
history
of
the
country
and
with
true
british
loyalty
everyone
obeyed
the
law
no
one
even
thought
of
disobeying
it
that
is
a
way
they
have
over
there
i
suppose
one
could
have
tempted
an
to
sell
one
glass
of
ale
though
he
offered
him
a
thousand
pounds
i
remember
the
shock
of
a
in
a
tiny
town
in
the
south
of
england
when
i
a
visitor
not
knowing
the
regulations
asked
for
a
beaker
of
beer
closed
sir
until
suppertime
she
informed
me
and
turned
away
not
expecting
and
not
getting
any
argument
had
we
respected
our
laws
we
would
not
have
had
prohibition
today
in
sweden
in
the
summer
of
a
referendum
was
taken
on
the
question
of
prohibition
and
the
wets
won
the
returns
were
as
follows
against
for
as
in
america
certain
localities
were
decidedly
in
favor
of
complete
prohibition
but
in
the
large
cities
one
found
the
desire
for
what
might
be
termed
the
female
vote
was
preponderately
a
sensible
system
has
been
evolved
in
sweden
they
regulate
the
liquor
traffic
under
what
is
known
as
the
bratt
system
only
one
organization
in
the
country
is
permitted
to
dispense
alcoholic
beverages
this
is
known
as
the
wine
and
spirits
central
and
as
in
the
province
of
quebec
tickets
are
issued
to
citizens
and
it
is
almost
impossible
to
acquire
more
than
allotted
quota
there
is
a
widespread
desire
for
a
continued
restriction
of
alcohol
but
naturally
quiet
forces
are
at
work
all
the
time
to
bring
about
complete
prohibition
certain
reformers
are
attempting
by
means
of
local
option
gradually
to
make
the
whole
of
sweden
as
dry
as
a
desert
but
bratt
is
equally
firm
for
the
present
system
which
he
contends
and
figures
would
seem
to
confirm
his
contention
that
it
is
better
for
the
people
than
anything
which
could
be
devised
he
has
pointed
out
that
in
before
liquor
restriction
drunkenness
was
amazingly
common
in
drunkenness
decreased
per
cent
arrests
for
drunkenness
have
gone
down
per
cent
under
his
system
there
is
little
doubt
that
government
control
in
sweden
as
elsewhere
has
worked
remarkably
well
russia
went
dry
now
the
soviet
government
has
decided
that
prohibition
is
a
complete
failure
resulting
in
the
secret
manufacture
as
in
the
united
states
of
much
vile
hootch
there
will
be
a
return
to
good
vodka
and
the
proceeds
coming
from
the
sale
of
it
will
be
used
to
educate
the
people
this
sound
sensible
it
is
unthinkable
that
europe
will
ever
be
a
sahara
yet
a
few
years
ago
it
was
likewise
unthinkable
that
our
own
country
would
come
to
the
arid
state
it
now
pretends
to
know
anything
is
possible
and
most
things
are
probable
in
these
days
of
delirium
and
stress
but
a
wineless
france
or
a
beerless
germany
does
seem
rather
grotesque
i
have
been
told
that
many
french
wine
merchants
certain
that
going
dry
is
but
a
phase
that
will
pass
are
keeping
vast
stores
of
champagne
in
readiness
to
ship
to
us
as
soon
as
our
laws
are
rescinded
they
simply
can
not
understand
our
eighteenth
amendment
yet
perhaps
they
will
have
written
into
their
own
statutes
some
equally
drastic
article
in
the
not
very
distant
future
that
is
how
the
prohibitionists
feel
at
any
rate
johnson
at
this
writing
is
working
hard
in
australia
to
bring
about
this
consummation
france
knows
already
the
ligue
nationale
contre
with
offices
in
paris
switzerland
has
the
ligue
suise
des
femmes
abstinentes
and
both
countries
are
being
well
peppered
with
depressing
posters
showing
the
evil
effects
of
booze
such
works
of
art
take
the
place
of
old
songs
like
dear
father
come
home
with
me
now
and
plays
like
nights
in
a
they
have
their
definite
function
they
will
prove
a
power
among
the
lower
and
middle
classes
scorned
though
they
may
be
by
the
manufacturers
and
dispensers
of
liquor
but
as
yet
the
economic
questions
involved
tease
and
torment
the
thrifty
latin
he
is
wise
enough
to
see
that
his
country
will
suffer
in
another
way
if
wine
and
other
drinks
are
totally
abolished
and
as
always
he
looks
to
america
for
some
solution
of
his
problem
the
question
therefore
arises
are
the
drys
in
the
united
states
strong
enough
financially
to
aid
europe
in
her
campaign
against
liquor
that
the
movement
has
started
there
in
deadly
earnest
can
not
be
denied
by
anyone
who
has
his
eye
on
the
situation
but
it
will
require
capital
to
keep
it
going
and
just
now
all
the
european
countries
are
notoriously
poor
is
the
cause
of
temperance
enough
to
grow
and
flourish
despite
the
handicap
of
lack
of
funds
there
may
be
in
the
united
states
who
will
finance
campaigns
abroad
just
as
it
has
been
rumored
repeatedly
with
what
regularity
certain
rich
advocates
of
prohibition
have
contributed
to
the
american
cause
in
this
event
the
european
movement
would
gain
a
tremendous
impetus
and
what
the
result
will
be
can
not
of
course
be
foretold
the
thing
happened
to
us
it
is
ridiculous
to
prophesy
that
it
can
not
happen
to
europe
the
pendulum
having
swung
all
the
way
for
us
would
seem
to
indicate
that
it
may
swing
all
or
part
of
the
way
for
britishers
and
latins
alike
it
will
be
interesting
to
watch
and
wait
then
we
shall
learn
whether
benevolent
autocracies
are
better
than
autocratic
democracies
whether
crowns
and
ermine
are
more
to
be
desired
than
and
europe
dry
do
not
smile
this
is
an
age
of
unexpected
events
a
period
of
transition
the
like
of
which
has
not
been
known
before
but
would
europeans
obey
laws
that
infringed
upon
their
personal
liberty
there
were
those
who
held
that
there
would
never
be
rebellion
and
riots
in
germany
since
the
germans
were
too
docile
a
people
to
rise
up
against
their
government
yet
we
know
what
the
germans
did
and
where
the
kaiser
is
today
the
spectacle
of
going
bone
dry
is
not
a
heartening
one
ambassadors
from
other
lands
have
seen
our
contempt
for
the
law
and
it
is
doubtful
if
any
of
them
would
recommend
to
their
countries
a
counterfeiting
of
our
methods
and
manners
we
have
come
to
little
else
than
disruption
and
failure
in
this
matter
of
prohibition
imitation
of
our
ways
would
amount
almost
to
madness
chapter
xx
what
are
we
going
to
do
about
it
one
finds
it
hard
to
believe
that
a
law
is
just
and
right
and
proper
which
so
many
splendid
minds
consider
otherwise
there
have
been
numerous
societies
formed
to
combat
the
volstead
act
and
in
their
long
lists
of
members
one
may
read
the
names
of
honorable
citizens
who
feel
impelled
to
express
their
views
hundreds
of
influential
newspapers
stand
solidly
against
the
eighteenth
amendment
the
fight
has
not
been
taken
up
in
one
section
of
the
country
only
mass
meetings
have
been
held
in
far
separated
localities
and
protests
have
been
voiced
everywhere
in
the
last
election
that
in
november
the
voice
of
the
people
was
heard
in
several
states
prohibition
was
an
issue
and
the
victory
was
almost
overwhelmingly
for
the
wets
wisconsin
for
instance
elected
seven
candidates
who
had
declared
themselves
for
a
modification
of
the
volstead
act
senator
reed
of
missouri
an
avowed
foe
of
prohibition
and
governor
edwards
of
new
jersey
an
even
more
ardent
won
over
their
opponents
having
made
their
views
definitely
known
edwards
now
goes
to
the
senate
illustration
the
prohibitionists
fail
to
realize
that
prohibition
for
them
is
in
itself
a
debauch
a
kind
of
wild
orgy
a
sadistic
spree
to
strap
us
all
to
the
snap
the
whip
and
keep
us
there
for
life
seems
to
be
their
idea
of
a
good
time
the
citizens
of
massachusetts
defeated
a
bill
for
additional
state
machinery
to
make
the
volstead
act
more
effective
and
in
illinois
there
proved
to
be
a
feeling
of
in
favor
of
light
wines
and
beer
the
rural
districts
of
ohio
caused
the
prohibitionists
to
gain
a
victory
in
that
state
but
there
is
little
doubt
that
a
change
is
sweeping
through
the
country
in
new
york
state
the
democratic
candidate
for
governor
ran
on
a
platform
against
a
republican
candidate
who
had
signed
the
wretched
act
the
former
won
by
a
vast
majority
the
people
were
well
aware
that
the
federal
laws
would
not
be
changed
simply
because
the
empire
state
wished
a
return
to
moderate
drinking
but
thousands
of
republicans
voted
for
the
avowedly
candidate
as
a
matter
of
principle
they
felt
that
at
least
a
splendid
gesture
had
been
made
and
that
those
who
looked
on
from
other
parts
of
the
country
sensing
the
will
of
the
people
of
new
york
might
come
to
realize
that
hereafter
the
candidate
for
office
who
announces
his
stand
on
the
topic
which
is
forever
being
discussed
has
the
better
chance
of
victory
the
time
for
equivocation
has
gone
by
the
people
want
to
know
how
politicians
feel
about
prohibition
and
the
defeat
of
volstead
himself
for
was
a
significant
circumstance
the
now
know
that
they
will
have
to
organize
and
fight
and
fight
hard
it
requires
no
tremendous
amount
of
vision
to
see
that
if
both
the
big
parties
at
present
in
power
refuse
to
consider
a
change
in
the
interpretation
of
the
volstead
act
a
third
party
will
arise
with
prohibition
as
the
foremost
issue
before
the
people
president
harding
has
said
that
whether
the
country
is
to
remain
wet
or
dry
will
be
a
political
issue
for
years
to
come
statesmen
and
politicians
alike
are
beginning
to
see
and
admit
a
change
in
the
feeling
of
the
people
on
the
subject
of
prohibition
it
is
nonsense
to
say
that
a
matter
which
is
discussed
everywhere
at
all
times
is
a
dead
issue
wherever
men
and
women
congregate
around
every
in
every
club
at
every
evening
party
the
topic
invariably
comes
up
is
no
significance
to
be
attached
to
this
circumstance
and
not
long
ago
the
english
and
french
were
complaining
about
american
visitors
since
they
found
it
rather
boresome
to
listen
day
in
and
day
out
to
nothing
but
their
talk
on
the
engrossing
subject
we
eat
sleep
and
i
was
going
to
say
drink
prohibition
we
have
made
a
ghastly
mistake
the
unforeseen
evils
that
have
come
in
the
wake
of
prohibition
far
outweigh
the
good
we
have
never
had
anything
but
poor
prohibition
and
if
it
is
true
that
those
who
feel
the
pinch
of
poverty
have
derived
benefit
from
the
closing
of
the
saloon
as
indeed
they
have
it
is
equally
true
that
the
moderately
have
had
their
expenses
increased
used
to
drinking
all
their
lives
they
were
not
to
be
whipped
into
obeying
a
law
with
which
they
had
no
sympathy
they
intended
humanly
enough
to
continue
to
get
their
grog
at
any
price
and
they
have
done
so
even
though
they
afterward
had
a
rendezvous
with
debt
the
poor
do
not
get
their
liquor
simply
because
they
can
not
afford
it
i
have
seen
clerks
buying
beer
at
cents
a
bottle
which
must
have
made
quite
a
hole
in
their
the
honest
laboring
man
could
scarcely
afford
that
extravagance
and
so
he
goes
beerless
to
bed
not
because
he
wishes
to
but
because
he
has
to
and
you
and
i
whenever
we
desire
liquid
refreshment
know
where
we
can
obtain
it
if
an
investigation
were
made
of
the
savings
of
the
great
middle
class
during
the
past
three
years
i
doubt
if
a
good
showing
would
be
discovered
and
is
it
not
of
some
importance
that
this
great
group
who
are
the
mainstay
of
the
republic
should
be
laying
aside
something
for
the
future
the
prohibitionists
will
say
that
they
have
no
sympathy
with
anyone
who
willfully
breaks
the
law
but
you
can
not
argue
with
people
who
count
it
no
sin
to
disregard
a
statute
with
clear
consciences
a
vast
body
of
people
take
not
the
slightest
heed
of
the
eighteenth
amendment
they
are
simply
bent
upon
getting
what
they
wish
despite
the
volstead
act
and
nothing
will
convince
them
that
they
are
not
right
a
law
is
of
absolutely
no
value
unless
it
meets
with
response
from
those
whom
it
seeks
to
improve
after
a
long
trial
anyone
but
a
blind
person
must
see
that
our
prohibition
laws
are
violently
opposed
by
millions
of
otherwise
good
citizens
the
situation
instead
of
becoming
better
as
the
league
has
all
along
predicted
has
become
steadily
and
obviously
worse
there
are
danger
signals
confronting
us
but
there
is
a
way
out
of
our
mess
that
way
lies
through
compromise
the
prohibitionists
compromised
as
of
course
they
are
well
aware
when
they
did
not
make
it
against
the
law
to
drink
in
private
homes
as
i
have
said
they
did
not
dare
go
quite
that
far
had
they
done
so
serious
consequences
would
have
followed
they
likewise
compromised
when
they
gave
us
of
one
per
cent
of
alcohol
in
our
beer
why
even
that
to
make
it
a
little
more
distasteful
perhaps
the
fact
is
that
the
american
people
are
tired
of
constitutional
amendments
i
have
heard
men
say
that
when
our
own
private
constitutions
need
an
amendment
we
can
be
depended
upon
to
add
one
we
are
not
fools
in
spite
of
the
reformers
we
still
believe
that
there
is
something
in
the
old
judgment
of
the
survival
of
the
fittest
the
worthy
emerge
the
unworthy
remain
where
they
belong
or
sink
to
the
depths
it
is
all
very
well
to
say
that
those
who
become
blind
through
the
drinking
of
deserve
their
wretched
fate
that
if
one
takes
such
chances
he
deserves
to
lose
his
eyesight
if
not
his
life
for
myself
i
can
not
look
at
the
matter
quite
so
coldly
i
have
the
deepest
sympathy
for
those
who
in
good
faith
drink
something
which
turns
out
to
be
something
else
they
have
simply
humanly
slipped
and
but
for
this
one
lapse
from
grace
they
may
be
most
estimable
citizens
i
think
it
is
far
more
terrible
that
a
decent
manufacturer
should
go
blind
because
an
unreasonable
and
unenforceable
law
is
on
our
books
than
that
a
million
worthless
imbeciles
should
lie
in
the
gutter
drunk
i
have
known
only
a
few
drunkards
who
ever
amounted
to
a
continental
in
after
years
they
were
hardly
worth
saving
it
is
not
very
pleasant
to
think
of
an
able
citizen
stricken
at
the
height
of
his
career
and
his
loss
to
the
community
is
much
more
important
than
the
salvation
of
a
dozen
roustabouts
during
the
christmas
holidays
of
in
and
around
new
york
city
alone
there
were
persons
made
blind
or
killed
outright
through
poisoning
and
during
another
christmas
season
caused
deaths
in
massachusetts
alone
somehow
i
do
not
like
to
contemplate
such
catastrophes
but
the
professional
reformers
may
be
made
of
sterner
stuff
than
i
let
us
have
done
with
the
folly
of
something
so
radically
false
as
prohibition
in
the
old
days
when
a
man
got
drunk
he
broke
the
social
code
now
he
breaks
not
only
that
but
the
penal
code
as
well
thereby
committing
two
offenses
against
society
but
it
is
curious
how
little
he
cares
about
the
second
offense
with
an
easy
conscience
he
deliberately
goes
about
it
in
fact
rather
rejoices
that
he
has
proved
himself
such
a
devil
drink
as
no
one
will
deny
is
an
inherently
evil
thing
a
terrible
force
but
so
is
electricity
a
terrible
force
yet
rightly
used
both
are
the
reverse
of
evil
but
just
as
the
prohibitionists
will
not
recognize
the
good
to
be
found
in
alcohol
they
refuse
to
admit
the
evils
resulting
from
the
present
drastic
laws
they
fail
to
realize
that
prohibition
for
them
is
in
itself
a
debauch
a
kind
of
wild
orgy
a
sadistic
spree
to
strap
us
all
to
the
snap
the
whip
and
keep
us
there
for
life
seems
to
be
their
idea
of
a
good
time
but
it
is
hardly
ours
we
have
begun
to
think
that
this
strange
and
perverted
conception
of
a
bacchanalian
orgy
has
lasted
quite
long
enough
and
when
the
tide
turns
the
prohibitionists
may
know
something
of
the
horrors
of
a
hangover
and
wonder
if
they
are
on
the
verge
of
a
nervous
breakdown
morning
some
approaching
election
may
not
be
a
pleasant
one
for
them
but
why
not
compromise
before
the
inevitable
day
arrives
rid
of
the
saloon
the
prohibition
triumph
is
complete
enough
local
option
will
continue
and
if
the
little
places
elect
to
go
dry
of
course
they
may
do
so
but
as
for
the
great
cities
especially
the
metropolis
looking
at
the
skull
of
its
oldtime
happiness
one
can
but
say
with
poor
new
yorick
senator
frelinghuysen
of
new
jersey
said
not
long
ago
that
prohibition
was
one
of
the
most
serious
problems
with
which
the
american
people
have
to
deal
the
country
districts
the
people
are
in
favor
of
upholding
the
volstead
law
he
made
it
clear
church
people
also
are
against
any
modification
of
the
dry
law
but
when
it
comes
to
big
industrial
centers
and
to
the
working
classes
to
say
nothing
about
the
population
they
are
all
clamoring
for
a
change
in
the
law
to
permit
the
sale
of
light
wines
and
if
we
would
enact
laws
tomorrow
giving
the
various
states
the
right
to
control
the
liquor
traffic
within
themselves
corruption
would
cease
and
a
sense
of
peace
and
happiness
would
descend
upon
the
country
the
constant
agitations
of
this
hour
can
not
go
on
there
is
a
nervous
tension
in
the
air
and
so
long
as
the
volstead
act
remains
there
will
be
disturbances
comparable
to
the
rumblings
of
earthquakes
those
of
us
who
love
america
yearn
for
a
return
to
truth
and
sanity
the
present
conditions
are
intolerable
each
political
party
is
striving
to
evade
this
big
issue
each
claims
that
neither
the
democrats
nor
the
republicans
gave
the
people
prohibition
yet
the
people
are
looking
to
one
or
the
other
party
to
take
a
stand
on
the
question
the
last
elections
proved
that
not
forever
can
there
be
a
process
of
evasion
a
third
political
party
will
come
out
boldly
and
strong
with
a
wet
plank
and
as
soon
as
the
politicians
sense
the
will
of
the
people
there
will
be
an
immediate
change
but
how
long
will
it
take
them
to
sense
that
will
recently
a
number
of
doctors
brought
suit
to
test
the
constitutionality
of
the
volstead
act
as
it
affects
the
limitation
on
liquor
which
they
may
prescribe
not
all
physicians
oppose
prohibition
indeed
many
have
stated
that
whiskey
is
not
essential
in
the
practice
of
medicine
others
hold
a
divergent
view
but
no
one
can
deny
that
things
have
come
to
a
strange
pass
when
congress
and
not
our
doctors
treats
patients
ill
with
pneumonia
and
other
diseases
surely
an
issue
as
clouded
as
this
should
be
cleared
up
light
wines
and
beer
will
return
there
is
little
doubt
of
that
but
many
people
hold
that
we
should
adopt
the
swedish
and
canadian
methods
of
government
control
we
have
seen
that
with
the
federal
authorities
managing
the
liquor
traffic
a
decent
business
is
done
bootlegging
is
practically
stopped
and
revenue
pours
into
the
governmental
coffers
contentment
takes
the
place
of
discontent
and
those
who
drink
pay
the
price
which
they
are
more
than
willing
to
do
it
is
so
obvious
that
this
is
the
right
method
to
pursue
that
it
seems
strange
there
should
be
any
argument
that
there
should
be
any
of
opposition
yet
the
prohibitionists
in
the
light
of
their
failure
in
the
united
states
continue
to
make
prophecies
of
a
world
in
the
years
to
be
with
amazing
clairvoyance
a
member
of
the
christian
temperance
union
has
predicted
that
in
uruguay
will
go
dry
and
likewise
argentine
austria
and
denmark
in
chili
in
great
britain
in
germany
in
france
in
japan
in
italy
in
spain
and
china
in
and
cuba
in
foreigners
have
frequently
been
heard
to
say
that
they
can
not
understand
why
americans
have
not
protested
with
a
louder
voice
against
the
legislation
which
concerns
prohibition
they
forget
or
they
do
not
realize
that
the
united
states
is
a
vast
and
that
there
are
alas
too
few
americans
left
to
make
much
of
an
impression
the
links
that
draw
together
the
individual
nations
of
european
countries
are
lacking
in
our
own
land
we
have
absorbed
every
race
on
earth
and
these
aliens
do
not
know
how
to
band
together
they
are
not
really
part
of
us
and
they
are
naturally
confused
at
our
methods
of
government
many
of
them
are
strangers
in
a
strange
land
and
perhaps
they
do
not
feel
justified
in
protesting
even
though
they
are
citizens
now
saying
to
themselves
that
if
the
americans
tolerate
such
rigid
reforms
who
are
they
to
utter
words
of
rebellion
is
it
not
that
prohibition
has
miserably
failed
when
the
president
finds
it
necessary
to
call
a
solemn
conclave
of
governors
to
see
what
can
be
done
after
three
years
to
force
the
people
to
obey
the
law
in
the
various
states
the
federal
authorities
by
that
gesture
admit
their
inability
to
cope
with
the
situation
which
has
now
become
intolerable
scandal
after
scandal
is
being
unearthed
in
sanctimonious
washington
the
seat
of
the
government
and
the
home
of
prohibition
it
is
being
revealed
that
many
congressmen
and
senators
preach
one
thing
and
practise
another
is
it
not
high
time
that
their
dishonesty
is
shown
up
they
should
be
made
as
ridiculous
as
possible
they
should
be
made
to
see
that
they
are
the
worst
americans
in
existence
pretending
to
be
virtuous
invoking
the
law
for
their
constituents
and
bootlegging
in
secret
for
at
least
the
rest
of
the
people
who
conscientiously
break
the
law
are
not
on
record
as
approving
it
no
one
is
sacrosanct
on
this
flaming
issue
government
buildings
are
said
to
contain
plenty
of
liquid
refreshment
for
the
parched
throats
of
these
eloquent
advocates
of
a
country
so
long
and
loudly
have
they
proclaimed
their
insincere
doctrine
that
at
the
end
of
a
forensic
day
they
doubtless
require
a
long
cool
drink
let
them
be
seen
in
all
their
inglorious
hypocrisy
let
the
whole
land
laugh
at
them
for
it
is
only
through
laughter
that
they
can
be
reached
and
hurt
a
law
that
is
winked
at
by
those
who
framed
it
is
not
worth
the
cost
required
to
set
it
up
in
type
but
of
course
nothing
will
be
done
no
names
will
be
named
the
same
hypocrisy
will
be
practised
here
when
someone
higher
up
is
to
be
uncovered
the
loudly
proclaimed
will
come
to
a
sudden
end
there
are
too
many
criminals
in
exalted
places
we
are
the
of
the
world
as
it
is
but
if
the
whole
truth
were
known
economically
the
people
will
have
to
have
it
driven
home
to
them
that
prohibition
is
a
mistake
we
are
forever
talking
about
the
tariff
yet
the
most
that
our
tariff
can
bring
in
is
about
a
year
gross
the
year
was
the
banner
year
in
the
united
states
in
producing
beer
there
were
barrels
sold
if
we
had
not
had
prohibition
thrust
upon
us
the
normal
growth
would
have
been
a
production
of
about
barrels
the
government
always
collected
revenue
at
the
source
there
was
no
bookkeeping
merely
a
stamping
a
labeling
of
each
barrel
and
that
was
all
there
was
to
it
think
of
the
tax
upon
this
one
product
alone
which
we
are
losing
in
canada
imposed
a
tax
of
on
a
gallon
of
beer
in
it
was
a
gallon
there
are
thirty
gallons
in
a
barrel
which
means
a
barrel
now
or
more
than
two
and
a
half
times
as
much
as
before
multiply
barrels
by
and
you
arrive
at
revenue
collected
at
the
source
with
no
obstructions
this
is
four
times
as
much
as
our
tariff
bill
would
give
to
the
country
moreover
if
beer
were
restored
innumerable
collateral
businesses
would
be
given
new
life
the
bottling
industry
corking
glassware
all
these
would
be
resuscitated
everyone
would
be
happy
and
personal
taxes
would
be
immeasurably
lessened
as
things
now
are
we
are
burdened
with
surtaxes
which
impoverish
all
kinds
of
industries
and
make
for
intense
crying
out
for
no
change
in
our
laws
it
is
the
prohibitionists
themselves
who
have
altered
our
statutes
can
they
not
be
changed
again
it
may
be
that
the
eighteenth
amendment
will
never
be
annulled
there
are
those
however
who
are
hopeful
even
of
that
but
congress
is
privileged
to
define
what
constitutes
an
intoxicating
beverage
and
the
volstead
act
is
not
static
the
people
will
elect
men
to
represent
them
at
washington
who
will
liberally
interpret
the
eighteenth
amendment
therein
lies
the
remedy
for
much
of
our
discontent
prohibition
rose
like
a
great
wave
it
is
falling
back
now
the
tide
comes
in
but
it
goes
out
again
and
one
can
begin
to
hear
the
surge
of
a
mighty
people
they
will
speak
at
the
polls
in
every
election
for
prohibition
until
it
is
modified
will
never
be
taken
out
of
national
politics
a
sane
compromise
would
clear
up
the
situation
almost
overnight
and
when
the
people
speak
the
government
must
heed
their
voice
notes
simple
typographical
errors
were
corrected
punctuation
hyphenation
and
spelling
were
made
consistent
when
a
predominant
preference
was
found
in
the
original
book
otherwise
they
were
not
changed
