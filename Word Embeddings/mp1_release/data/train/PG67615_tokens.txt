what
the
girl
did
the
girl
at
the
switchboard
held
her
breath
the
detective
waiting
in
the
business
office
saw
her
the
girl
at
the
switchboard
was
helen
bailey
the
waiting
detective
was
nick
carter
no
man
was
ever
more
quick
than
he
to
rightly
interpret
a
facial
expression
the
partition
through
which
he
saw
her
was
of
glass
or
a
portion
of
it
dividing
the
general
office
in
the
central
telephone
exchange
from
the
room
in
which
the
great
switchboards
were
stationed
there
were
other
girls
half
a
score
of
them
seated
in
front
of
the
innumerably
perforated
boards
they
were
too
busy
to
notice
one
another
their
eyes
were
intent
upon
their
work
their
deft
hands
flew
from
plug
to
plug
withdrawing
some
inserting
others
their
frequent
monotonous
calls
the
noise
of
the
buzzers
and
the
snapping
of
the
plugs
were
the
only
sounds
to
be
heard
in
that
busy
room
hello
line
is
they
were
like
machines
those
switchboard
girls
human
living
palpitating
machines
each
a
connecting
link
for
others
in
every
phase
of
life
every
calling
and
vocation
from
the
gilded
mansions
of
exclusive
society
to
the
dives
of
the
underworld
they
are
the
servants
of
all
and
in
a
measure
the
confidantes
of
all
the
girl
who
had
caught
nick
eye
was
striking
not
alone
because
of
her
facial
expression
at
that
moment
but
because
of
her
remarkable
grace
and
beauty
she
was
about
nineteen
a
pronounced
blonde
with
regular
features
large
blue
eyes
and
a
sensitive
mouth
a
complexion
an
abundance
of
wavy
golden
hair
crowning
a
shapely
head
finely
poised
on
a
graceful
slender
yet
figure
then
clad
in
a
skirt
and
a
dainty
white
waist
it
was
the
expression
on
her
fair
face
however
that
had
riveted
the
attention
though
he
could
see
her
only
in
part
profile
nick
never
had
seen
a
look
of
more
poignant
anguish
on
a
human
face
the
girl
was
pitched
forward
on
her
high
chair
her
hand
grasping
one
of
the
plugs
which
she
had
pushed
into
the
switchboard
and
now
seemed
impelled
to
withdraw
that
would
have
abruptly
ended
the
conversation
between
the
two
persons
whom
she
had
brought
into
communication
and
to
whose
intercourse
she
was
listening
that
she
really
was
listening
listening
as
one
might
to
the
reading
of
own
death
warrant
was
painfully
apparent
her
eyes
seemed
to
be
starting
from
her
head
but
with
the
wildly
vacant
expression
of
one
horrified
one
whose
mind
was
elsewhere
every
vestige
of
color
had
left
her
cheeks
her
lips
were
gray
and
drawn
her
graceful
figure
as
motionless
as
if
every
nerve
and
muscle
was
as
strained
and
tense
as
a
bowstring
scott
thought
nick
watching
her
whom
is
she
listening
and
to
what
the
girl
suddenly
withdrew
the
plug
then
with
a
quick
change
of
expression
with
a
look
of
determination
she
inserted
it
again
renewing
the
telephone
connection
then
she
listened
again
ghastly
and
horrified
for
nearly
a
minute
and
then
her
head
dropped
to
one
shoulder
as
if
her
neck
was
hinged
her
arm
fell
like
that
of
a
corpse
dragging
the
plug
out
of
the
switchboard
while
her
tense
form
relaxed
and
fell
from
the
chair
dropping
with
a
thud
upon
the
floor
beside
it
nick
carter
had
seen
what
was
coming
and
he
already
was
on
his
way
to
the
room
darting
out
of
the
office
and
through
the
adjoining
corridor
he
heard
the
screams
of
the
frightened
girls
when
he
entered
and
with
quick
discrimination
he
turned
to
the
one
and
said
has
only
fainted
bring
a
glass
of
water
be
quick
about
the
girl
addressed
ran
to
a
near
closet
and
obeyed
him
nick
raised
the
prostrate
girl
a
little
supporting
her
against
his
knee
and
with
a
wet
handkerchief
he
bathed
her
brow
and
cheeks
paying
no
attention
to
the
fright
and
consternation
of
his
observers
the
girl
revived
in
a
very
few
moments
a
low
moan
as
pathetic
as
the
facial
expression
which
had
preceded
her
collapse
broke
from
her
gray
lips
her
eyelids
fluttered
spasmodically
then
were
raised
and
she
gazed
up
vacantly
at
the
kindly
face
they
did
they
get
him
she
gasped
impulsively
almost
frantically
they
did
they
get
him
nick
waved
aside
the
several
girls
who
had
gathered
near
one
of
the
windows
he
commanded
her
some
fresh
air
get
whom
my
girl
the
last
was
addressed
to
the
stricken
girl
while
nick
gently
raised
her
to
a
sitting
position
on
the
floor
she
turned
and
looked
at
him
then
suddenly
seemed
to
realize
what
had
occurred
she
gazed
at
nick
again
striving
to
rise
and
replied
more
calmly
whom
what
do
you
mean
you
know
what
i
mean
nick
inquired
helping
her
to
a
chair
i
she
replied
you
for
assisting
me
sure
i
know
what
you
nick
was
sure
of
the
contrary
but
he
did
not
say
so
instead
he
smiled
and
explained
his
presence
there
by
saying
happened
to
be
in
the
office
when
you
fainted
i
saw
you
fall
and
hurried
in
to
aid
you
are
you
subject
to
such
attacks
sir
i
remember
ever
having
fainted
away
may
have
heard
something
that
alarmed
you
or
no
sir
nothing
of
the
kind
interrupted
the
girl
can
not
account
for
you
remember
what
number
had
been
called
what
connection
you
had
made
what
was
being
said
do
not
the
girl
insisted
remember
nothing
about
it
i
know
only
that
i
was
not
feeling
well
this
morning
i
awoke
with
a
racking
headache
i
suddenly
felt
dizzy
and
then
i
fainted
that
is
all
i
know
about
it
please
question
me
further
able
now
to
return
to
my
work
thank
you
again
nick
knew
that
the
girl
was
lying
but
he
alone
had
observed
her
agitation
for
several
moments
before
she
fainted
she
still
was
pale
and
nervous
trembling
visibly
while
she
replied
to
his
questions
but
it
was
obvious
that
she
was
determined
to
admit
nothing
in
regard
to
what
she
evidently
had
heard
at
the
switchboard
nick
decided
not
to
press
her
further
therefore
and
he
bowed
indifferently
and
returned
to
the
business
office
manager
lawton
for
whom
he
had
been
waiting
came
in
a
few
moments
later
and
nick
transacted
the
business
for
which
he
had
called
he
then
quietly
told
him
of
the
incident
and
pointed
out
the
girl
who
had
fainted
is
her
name
he
then
inquired
bailey
replied
lawton
smiling
is
the
most
capable
girl
in
our
is
a
very
beautiful
girl
too
nick
observed
as
good
as
she
is
beautiful
lawton
said
with
a
nod
man
who
gets
her
for
a
wife
nick
will
get
a
does
she
live
boards
in
lexington
her
parents
both
are
dead
she
has
only
a
brother
i
believe
who
well
i
know
very
little
about
him
why
are
you
so
interested
in
the
girl
lawton
added
laughing
not
smitten
with
her
beauty
nick
are
you
nick
smiled
and
shook
his
head
then
arose
to
go
as
he
passed
out
he
glanced
again
through
the
glass
partition
at
the
several
girls
at
the
switchboards
helen
bailey
had
resumed
her
work
as
if
nothing
had
occurred
nick
still
had
her
in
mind
when
he
left
the
building
and
walked
up
the
street
he
had
in
mind
too
the
impulsive
almost
frantic
words
that
had
broken
from
her
when
with
returning
consciousness
she
took
up
her
train
of
thoughts
just
where
she
had
left
them
the
thoughts
which
had
brought
that
terrible
expression
to
her
fair
lovely
face
they
get
him
he
said
to
himself
jove
that
was
a
rather
significant
question
asked
as
she
asked
it
and
under
such
circumstances
get
whom
get
him
for
what
was
some
man
in
danger
one
with
whom
she
is
in
love
perhaps
and
for
whose
sake
she
was
so
shocked
and
alarmed
there
certainly
was
some
serious
reason
for
that
horrified
expression
and
her
sudden
collapse
i
would
have
been
glad
to
aid
her
if
she
would
have
confided
in
me
but
she
preferred
to
lie
and
well
it
was
up
to
her
it
is
barely
possible
that
she
will
regret
it
chapter
ii
a
friend
in
need
nick
intuition
in
regard
to
the
telephone
girl
was
verified
much
sooner
than
he
really
expected
he
entered
his
madison
avenue
residence
about
an
hour
later
and
found
in
the
library
his
two
chief
assistants
chickering
carter
and
patsy
garvan
he
heard
the
following
remarks
from
patsy
as
he
was
approaching
the
open
door
certainly
is
a
peach
chick
and
i
felt
dead
sorry
for
her
in
wrong
all
right
but
i
half
credit
the
charges
at
charges
patsy
nick
inquired
entering
whom
were
you
speaking
a
girl
i
saw
at
police
headquarters
about
twenty
minutes
ago
said
patsy
turning
from
his
desk
went
down
there
on
that
waldron
the
girl
under
arrest
what
helping
a
crook
elude
the
police
patsy
explained
denied
it
chief
sobbing
as
if
her
heart
would
break
but
putting
her
through
the
third
degree
now
hoping
to
break
her
down
and
force
a
confession
from
her
my
money
goes
on
the
girl
chief
all
the
is
the
girl
nick
questioned
you
learn
any
of
the
circumstances
nodded
patsy
name
is
helen
is
that
so
a
telephone
girl
and
a
sister
of
barton
bailey
wanted
for
robbery
in
mantell
big
department
store
where
he
was
employed
at
the
time
he
got
away
with
a
diamond
sunburst
you
remember
and
nearly
cracked
the
skull
of
gus
flint
one
of
the
store
detectives
who
had
seen
him
lift
the
bauble
and
tried
to
prevent
his
escape
that
was
six
months
i
recall
the
case
said
nick
with
a
more
serious
expression
what
are
the
circumstances
bearing
on
the
arrest
seems
that
bart
bailey
was
seen
going
into
a
house
in
east
street
about
ten
this
morning
patsy
continued
was
in
disguise
but
was
recognized
by
some
one
who
declined
to
give
his
name
to
the
headquarters
chief
to
whom
he
hastened
to
stated
i
suppose
that
he
had
seen
bailey
going
into
the
what
said
patsy
chief
then
called
up
the
precinct
station
and
told
the
sergeant
to
go
to
the
house
with
a
couple
of
men
and
get
he
could
finish
giving
his
instructions
including
the
number
of
the
house
the
telephone
connection
was
suddenly
broken
nearly
ten
minutes
passed
before
the
chief
could
get
it
renewed
and
that
brief
delay
cost
the
guns
their
man
when
they
arrived
at
the
house
bailey
had
been
gone
about
three
the
chief
know
his
sister
is
employed
in
the
telephone
exchange
you
exclaimed
patsy
sententiously
him
alone
to
have
learned
that
he
has
had
men
out
after
bailey
for
nearly
six
months
he
learned
too
that
helen
bailey
was
the
operator
who
connected
him
with
the
precinct
station
and
he
noticed
while
talking
with
the
sergeant
that
the
connection
was
broken
once
and
quickly
thought
nick
recalling
his
own
observations
was
not
a
minute
later
patsy
added
was
broken
completely
and
the
chief
lost
his
man
it
made
him
sore
for
fair
he
knows
the
girl
must
have
overheard
his
orders
to
the
sergeant
and
he
suspects
that
she
purposely
cut
him
off
and
afterward
telephoned
her
brother
to
an
unreasonable
inference
nick
allowed
a
bit
grimly
patsy
the
girl
did
nothing
of
the
whiz
patsy
returned
gazing
you
wise
to
something
bearing
on
the
case
do
you
mean
mind
what
i
mean
nick
interposed
glancing
at
his
watch
inform
you
later
knock
those
suspicions
out
of
the
head
in
about
two
shakes
of
a
tail
helen
bailey
is
a
heroine
much
more
heroic
than
most
girls
would
have
been
under
the
same
nick
did
not
wait
to
explain
to
chick
and
patsy
disregarding
their
looks
of
surprise
he
replaced
his
hat
and
started
immediately
for
the
police
headquarters
he
was
so
well
known
there
where
his
services
were
very
frequently
required
that
no
one
would
have
thought
of
opposing
him
he
learned
that
the
chief
still
was
talking
with
helen
bailey
in
his
private
office
into
which
nick
walked
without
the
ceremony
of
knocking
the
chief
regarded
him
with
a
look
of
surprise
it
became
more
marked
even
when
helen
bailey
pale
and
with
eyes
red
from
weeping
uttered
a
low
cry
and
exclaimed
sir
here
is
the
man
who
assisted
me
this
is
the
man
i
have
told
you
about
he
knows
that
my
faint
was
not
feigned
he
will
tell
you
will
tell
the
chief
all
that
is
necessary
miss
bailey
nick
interposed
smiling
and
shaking
hands
with
her
am
very
glad
to
be
able
to
befriend
said
the
chief
with
his
austerity
suddenly
vanished
do
you
know
about
this
matter
nick
know
all
about
it
chief
nick
replied
taking
a
chair
was
here
when
this
young
lady
was
brought
in
he
has
told
me
why
she
was
arrested
and
what
you
suspect
but
in
wrong
chief
and
come
here
to
say
a
word
for
the
word
from
you
carter
is
usually
enough
replied
the
chief
while
helen
bailey
hearing
the
name
of
the
famous
detective
gazed
at
him
with
amazement
and
inexpressible
relief
can
explain
in
a
nutshell
said
nick
was
in
the
telephone
office
chief
and
saw
all
that
did
you
make
of
it
carter
asked
the
chief
nick
then
told
him
all
he
had
seen
and
what
he
had
done
girl
did
not
cut
you
off
chief
but
quite
the
contrary
he
added
knew
nevertheless
precisely
what
your
communication
signified
i
saw
her
withdraw
the
plug
once
then
willfully
reinsert
it
i
saw
how
terribly
she
felt
how
terribly
she
was
tempted
and
i
now
know
too
with
what
heroism
she
resisted
the
temptation
and
stuck
to
her
duty
though
it
involved
the
sacrifice
of
her
own
the
chief
gazed
for
a
moment
at
the
detective
who
had
spoken
quite
feelingly
girl
has
told
me
that
nick
but
i
could
not
credit
it
he
said
more
gravely

true
chief

can
bank
on
mighty
glad
you
have
showed
up

you
would
the
chief
turned
to
helen
bailey
and
laid
his
hand
on
hers

girl
he
said
gently

times

alternative

and
a
brave
girl
and
sorry
to

given
you
so
much
pain
and
trouble
i
now
believe
all
you
have
told
me
and
very
proud
of
helen
was
sobbing
again
but
with
mingled
gratitude
and
relief
she
turned
and
grasped
hand
saying
brokenly
carter
how
can
i
thank
you
how
can
i
thank
you
not
trying
to
do
so
nick
replied

moments

dried
her
eyes
and
obeyed
him
nick
had
remained
only
to
question
the
chief
concerning
bart
bailey
and
to
find
out
what
had
been
learned
about
him

the
house

nights
and
requesting
the
privilege

to
the
landlady
i
a
total
stranger
she
knows
nothing
about
him
i
happen
to
know
however
that
a
very
bad
egg
and
i
wanted
to
get
nick
remained
only
a
few
moments
longer
then
went
to
the
outer
office
and
rejoined
the
waiting
girl
with
me
he
said
pleasantly
is
no
occasion
for
you
to
remain
here
i
think
you
will
ever
be
wanted
again
miss
can
not
express
my
gratitude
carter
she
replied
while
she
accompanied
him
to
the
street
try
smiled
nick
me
something
about
yourself
and
your
brother
he
used
to
work
for
mantell
goulard
i
sir
young
mantell
gave
him
a
position
there
for
for
my
sake
said
helen
blushing
in
a
way
that
nick
rightly
interpreted
bart
go
straight
he
is
bad
awfully
bad
he
is
only
my
half
brother
nick
saw
that
the
topic
was
a
painful
one
for
her
and
he
decided
not
to
press
his
inquiries
he
learned
that
the
rascal
had
frequently
threatened
her
however
because
of
her
refusals
to
join
in
his
knavish
projects
and
that
the
girl
stood
somewhat
in
fear
of
him
nick
took
her
lexington
avenue
address
therefore
and
promised
to
aid
her
again
if
occasion
required
it
smiling
in
response
to
her
repeated
thanks
he
then
placed
her
in
a
taxicab
which
he
hailed
and
saw
her
driven
rapidly
away
well
satisfied
with
the
kindly
deed
he
had
done
but
not
supposing
for
a
moment
that
it
would
have
any
further
significance
chapter
iii
the
man
of
last
resort
are
detectives
carter
and
detectives
said
nick
visitor
that
i
mean
that
only
half
of
them
are
worthy
of
the
name
half
of
the
remainder
are
mediocre
and
only
one
in
a
hundred
of
the
rest
is
really
keen
and
clever
you
carter
are
the
recognized
man
of
last
resort
when
all
others
have
failed
it
is
to
you
that
the
harrowed
victim
of
crookdom
turns
for
aid
as
the
only
man
in
christendom
who
can
ferret
out
the
truth
and
round
up
the
guilty
that
sir
is
why
i
am
nick
carter
laughed
are
complimentary
mantell
and
i
appreciate
your
very
exalted
opinion
of
me
he
replied
a
bit
dryly
that
sounds
very
nice
and
pretty
remarkably
so
but
it
does
not
do
what
you
asserted
it
tells
me
only
what
impelled
you
to
come
here
not
why
you
are
here
suppose
you
come
to
the
point
and
tell
me
visitor
joined
in
the
genial
laugh
as
did
chick
and
patsy
who
were
seated
with
them
in
attractively
furnished
library
it
was
about
seven
in
the
evening
that
of
the
very
day
on
which
had
occurred
the
episodes
described
he
was
a
young
man
this
visitor
of
remarkably
frank
and
prepossessing
appearance
he
was
still
under
thirty
set
up
like
an
athlete
and
scrupulously
well
dressed
he
was
the
type
of
man
to
whom
others
are
instinctively
drawn
and
to
whom
women
turn
for
a
second
look
nick
long
had
known
him
by
name
and
sight
the
only
son
of
wealthy
henry
mantell
of
mantell
goulard
the
owners
of
the
vast
sixth
avenue
department
store
to
which
reference
already
has
been
made
and
which
then
was
by
far
the
largest
establishment
of
its
kind
in
the
country
he
was
frank
mantell
of
whom
helen
bailey
had
spoken
to
nick
in
connection
with
the
robbery
committed
by
her
recreant
brother
to
the
point
eh
he
replied
still
smiling
is
a
very
good
suggestion
carter
and
i
will
act
upon
it
goulard
the
junior
partner
of
our
firm
was
to
have
met
here
to
discuss
our
business
with
you
pending
his
arrival
however
i
will
do
what
you
suggest
and
tell
you
why
i
am
good
i
am
all
ears
nick
remarked
knocking
the
ashes
from
his
cigar
am
here
carter
because
of
the
tremendous
leak
in
our
business
said
frank
more
gravely
refer
of
course
to
the
department
store
of
mantell
goulard
of
which
i
am
one
of
the
managers
my
father
you
know
is
the
senior
am
acquainted
with
your
father
nick
bowed
was
this
leak
discovered
months
ago
after
our
semiannual
taking
of
stock
our
business
showed
a
shrinkage
of
more
than
thirty
thousand
dollars
that
of
the
past
six
months
is
even
worse
running
close
to
fifty
thousand
in
other
words
carter
the
leakage
the
past
year
is
close
upon
eighty
thousand
too
large
to
be
charged
to
the
account
said
nick
you
unable
to
discover
the
cause
the
contrary
carter
said
mantell
know
the
mean
that
eighty
thousand
worth
of
merchandise
has
been
taken
from
your
store
in
the
past
year
and
that
you
are
unable
to
discover
the
thieves
said
nick
is
precisely
what
i
mean
frank
replied
a
bit
more
forcibly
a
matter
of
fact
carter
we
are
up
against
a
most
extraordinary
game
of
systematic
and
persistent
robbery
day
after
day
and
frequently
during
the
night
articles
of
material
value
disappear
most
mysteriously
from
all
parts
of
the
store
we
know
where
they
go
nor
how
the
thefts
are
committed
we
have
not
the
slightest
clew
to
the
identity
of
the
kinds
of
goods
are
chiefly
missing
kinds
but
invariably
articles
of
considerable
value
costly
laces
of
every
description
fine
handkerchiefs
pocketbooks
and
jewelry
full
pieces
of
expensive
silks
and
satins
fine
lace
draperies
and
but
i
could
not
begin
to
enumerate
them
they
disappear
as
if
they
had
evaporated
from
our
shelves
counters
and
show
it
be
the
work
of
professional
shoplifters
utterly
impossible
it
is
much
too
about
your
help
out
of
the
question
said
mantell
decidedly
employ
about
nine
hundred
clerks
but
they
have
absolutely
no
opportunity
for
thefts
of
such
character
and
magnitude
it
would
be
impossible
for
them
to
take
the
goods
from
the
store
without
being
detected
we
have
had
them
closely
watched
nevertheless
since
these
daily
robberies
were
first
discovered
but
we
have
failed
to
detect
a
single
thief
among
our
have
store
detectives
of
course
said
nick
inquiringly
on
every
they
accomplished
anything
little
carter
that
we
put
the
case
into
the
hands
of
half
a
dozen
headquarters
men
about
two
months
ago
their
work
has
been
equally
futile
not
a
piece
of
the
stolen
goods
has
been
traced
not
a
clew
has
been
found
pointing
to
the
identity
of
the
crooks
or
the
way
in
which
the
thefts
were
seems
very
strange
nick
remarked
is
right
chief
and
then
some
put
in
patsy
must
be
a
bunch
of
clever
ginks
at
work
along
new
and
original
seems
to
be
about
the
size
of
it
nick
added
that
is
precisely
how
the
matter
stands
frank
mantell
continued
i
said
in
the
beginning
carter
you
are
the
man
of
last
resort
all
others
have
failed
and
we
now
turn
to
you
for
advice
and
assistance
i
think
we
should
have
done
so
at
the
outset
it
would
have
saved
us
a
barrel
of
seem
to
feel
sure
that
i
shall
succeed
in
solving
the
mystery
smiled
nick
carter
i
do
mantell
rejoined
seems
to
be
one
of
your
invariable
acquirements
i
feel
that
it
will
prove
so
in
this
i
decide
to
take
the
hope
you
will
not
demur
over
me
ask
you
a
few
questions
said
nick
drawing
up
in
his
chair
and
dropping
his
burned
cigar
into
a
cuspidor
any
headquarters
men
now
at
work
on
the
case
sir
we
dropped
the
last
of
them
store
detectives
still
are
at
work
in
line
with
their
customary
duties
they
would
not
in
any
way
interfere
with
your
would
not
permit
them
to
do
so
nick
said
a
bit
dryly
would
be
even
better
perhaps
if
they
were
ignorant
of
my
interest
in
the
matter
who
besides
you
knows
of
your
intention
to
employ
me
on
the
case
my
father
goulard
and
lombard
my
father
and
i
look
after
the
correspondence
and
the
financial
end
of
the
business
goulard
and
lombard
have
entire
charge
of
operations
in
the
store
goulard
is
of
course
the
chief
director
we
decided
this
afternoon
to
appeal
to
you
for
aid
no
one
else
is
informed
of
our
it
a
point
then
to
inform
no
one
else
nick
replied
will
at
least
look
into
the
matter
and
see
what
i
can
make
of
i
am
glad
to
hear
mantell
when
did
you
first
suspect
this
system
of
wholesale
robbery
and
begin
to
investigate
it
nick
inquired
six
months
ago
frank
replied
knew
of
many
thefts
previous
to
that
time
and
tried
in
vain
to
discover
the
culprits
not
until
we
had
taken
stock
and
our
books
showed
such
a
tremendous
leakage
however
did
we
realize
how
extensive
a
felony
we
were
up
against
we
then
began
the
investigations
that
have
proved
so
was
about
the
time
bart
bailey
was
seen
stealing
a
diamond
sunburst
it
it
was
said
mantell
with
a
look
of
surprise
did
you
learn
about
that
newspapers
mentioned
it
nick
said
evasively
yes
i
you
at
that
time
or
since
suspect
that
bailey
was
in
league
with
the
gang
of
crooks
committing
the
numerous
robberies
i
speak
of
them
as
a
gang
of
course
because
such
extensive
work
would
require
several
persons
and
careful
suspected
it
certainly
but
there
was
no
other
evidence
in
confirmation
of
it
mantell
explained
the
escape
and
disappearance
of
bailey
moreover
the
robberies
continued
as
frequently
as
before
that
indicated
in
a
measure
that
he
was
not
identified
with
the
other
nick
allowed
happen
to
know
that
bart
bailey
as
he
is
called
is
a
somewhat
vicious
character
were
you
aware
of
that
when
he
was
employed
in
your
store
mantell
colored
slightly
but
showed
no
inclination
to
hide
the
truth
was
aware
of
it
he
admitted
had
a
personal
reason
for
giving
him
employment
frankly
carter
i
am
deeply
in
love
with
his
sister
helen
bailey
who
is
as
good
and
virtuous
as
he
is
employed
him
for
her
sake
i
wanted
to
give
him
a
chance
i
told
him
just
what
i
knew
about
him
and
gave
him
a
talking
to
fashion
and
he
promised
to
go
dead
straight
and
do
his
best
it
was
the
opportunity
of
a
lifetime
for
i
would
have
pushed
him
forward
for
all
he
was
mantell
earnestly
added
i
fear
it
in
him
carter
to
be
anything
but
a
appears
so
mantell
would
marry
helen
with
the
sanction
of
all
of
my
family
if
she
would
have
me
frank
gravely
asserted
she
can
not
ignore
the
fact
that
her
brother
is
an
outlaw
of
society
and
she
feels
that
she
must
not
bring
disgrace
upon
me
dear
foolish
girl
as
if
she
were
responsible
for
the
conduct
of
her
brother
hang
it
only
her
half
brother
at
that
and
ah
that
should
be
goulard
we
will
plan
for
your
campaign
against
these
infernal
will
be
no
planning
with
me
mantell
nick
replied
as
joseph
his
butler
passed
through
the
hall
and
answered
the
doorbell
do
my
own
planning
and
work
out
problems
in
my
own
peculiar
way
i
will
be
pleased
to
meet
goulard
nevertheless
and
hear
what
he
has
to
frank
mantell
was
right
in
that
the
caller
was
gaston
goulard
and
he
was
presently
ushered
in
by
the
butler
he
was
an
erect
somewhat
imposing
man
close
upon
fifty
he
was
smooth
shaved
of
dark
complexion
with
strong
features
and
penetrating
black
eyes
he
had
been
a
widower
about
four
years
having
no
children
but
still
retaining
his
fine
fifth
avenue
residence
and
a
retinue
of
servants
he
was
a
member
of
the
best
clubs
and
a
man
of
recognized
ability
political
influence
and
social
standing
mantell
received
him
graciously
and
introduced
him
to
chick
and
patsy
while
goulard
removed
his
kid
gloves
and
shook
hands
with
all
are
here
before
me
frank
he
remarked
after
greeting
the
detectives
was
unavoidably
think
it
matters
mantell
replied
have
told
carter
all
that
you
could
have
told
him
and
all
that
he
is
really
inclined
to
hear
he
has
consented
to
take
the
case
and
good
goulard
interrupted
in
somewhat
brusque
and
metallic
tones
am
glad
to
hear
it
what
do
you
intend
doing
carter
that
is
the
main
nick
gazed
at
him
quite
intently
really
know
he
replied
know
mean
what
i
say
that
i
know
nick
put
in
smiling
must
consider
the
matter
i
must
determine
what
best
can
be
done
i
must
visit
your
store
and
size
up
the
opportunities
for
such
wholesale
robbery
before
i
can
say
what
i
will
do
you
can
hardly
expect
more
of
me
at
present
true
perhaps
goulard
admitted
with
signs
of
reluctance
are
up
against
such
a
costly
game
however
and
have
found
the
efforts
of
other
detectives
so
entirely
useless
that
i
really
wondered
what
steps
you
would
take
to
discover
the
wonder
too
since
hearing
statements
nick
replied
smiling
again
appears
like
a
difficult
problem
does
indeed
and
you
must
keep
me
informed
of
your
will
make
it
a
point
to
do
is
all
we
can
reasonably
ask
then
said
goulard
with
an
approving
nod
we
can
aid
you
in
any
way
or
will
inform
you
goulard
in
that
good
when
will
you
begin
your
work
as
soon
as
i
have
decided
how
to
begin
it
said
nick
davy
crockett
i
make
sure
i
am
right
before
going
ahead
i
think
you
may
expect
me
or
one
of
my
assistants
at
your
store
would
prefer
that
you
give
the
matter
your
personal
attention
said
goulard
suggestively
always
do
that
sir
when
engaged
in
an
investigation
of
even
the
simplest
kind
of
a
case
nick
said
with
seeming
indifference
if
that
gazabo
gets
anything
out
of
the
chief
do
it
with
a
double
corkscrew
thought
patsy
noting
suave
reticence
and
not
half
liking
the
strong
dark
face
of
this
second
visitor
goulard
did
not
prolong
his
interview
however
save
to
discuss
the
matter
in
a
general
way
and
learn
what
information
mantell
had
imparted
it
was
eight
when
the
two
men
left
the
residence
nick
seeing
them
to
the
door
and
then
returning
to
the
library
what
do
you
make
of
it
chick
at
once
inquired
saw
that
you
were
not
inclined
to
confide
your
opinions
to
goulard
that
convinced
me
that
you
had
formed
one
at
i
was
hit
in
the
same
spot
declared
patsy
nick
smiled
and
resumed
his
seat
confide
in
either
of
them
he
replied
have
as
you
infer
come
to
at
least
one
is
that
robberies
are
not
the
work
of
shoplifters
nor
any
outside
crooks
said
nick
have
been
much
too
numerous
and
varied
the
crooks
are
among
the
persons
employed
in
the
think
so
too
chick
nodded
for
that
reason
alone
chick
i
would
confide
in
no
one
in
the
store
from
the
heads
of
the
firm
down
to
the
boy
who
sweeps
the
back
stairs
said
nick
is
a
mistake
many
detectives
make
that
of
blindly
confiding
perhaps
in
the
very
culprit
they
are
out
to
right
chief
put
in
patsy
any
inquisitive
person
in
that
store
learns
of
my
designs
it
will
be
only
when
they
culminate
and
his
curiosity
may
cost
him
something
nick
pointedly
added
is
imperative
to
successful
work
in
a
case
of
this
agree
with
you
said
chick
with
a
nod
of
approval
sure
does
look
like
inside
work
said
patsy
how
do
they
get
out
with
the
goods
the
headquarters
men
are
not
lunkheads
nor
are
the
store
detectives
blind
how
do
the
crooks
get
out
with
such
quantities
of
merchandise
must
find
the
answer
to
that
question
nick
replied
detectives
in
their
efforts
to
discover
the
crooks
themselves
may
have
neglected
to
look
sharply
enough
for
it
we
may
meet
with
more
success
in
fact
by
working
backward
chief
questioned
patsy
do
you
mean
finding
out
where
the
goods
are
disposed
of
through
what
channel
they
reach
their
destination
and
by
working
back
over
the
same
route
even
to
the
moment
of
the
theft
nick
explained
jove
that
plan
might
prove
profitable
said
chick
goods
can
not
have
been
pawned
in
this
city
the
headquarters
men
would
have
run
them
down
within
nick
agreed
is
safe
to
assume
nevertheless
that
the
goods
are
stolen
to
be
converted
into
money
which
necessitates
either
pawning
or
selling
them
they
may
have
been
shipped
to
some
other
city
for
that
how
are
we
to
learn
what
city
chief
assuming
that
you
are
right
questioned
patsy
have
a
hunch
that
the
way
will
appear
replied
nick
is
one
other
point
of
which
we
can
take
advantage
i
think
and
it
may
start
us
on
the
case
right
off
the
mean
presence
in
new
york
and
what
occurred
do
you
see
in
that
am
convinced
that
bailey
was
in
league
with
the
other
crooks
when
he
stole
the
diamond
sunburst
and
a
hundred
to
one
that
he
still
is
in
league
with
them
in
some
capacity
nick
explained
he
had
not
been
stealing
the
jewel
it
probably
would
have
gone
the
way
of
the
other
plunder
the
circumstances
forced
him
to
bolt
with
it
however
and
to
lie
low
ever
how
can
we
take
advantage
of
all
that
asked
chick
quite
get
take
advantage
of
his
antipathy
for
his
half
sister
said
nick
like
her
despite
their
kinship
and
he
already
has
repeatedly
threatened
how
take
advantage
of
it
will
hear
of
what
occurred
that
she
made
no
intentional
move
to
prevent
the
police
from
getting
him
despite
that
she
could
easily
have
done
so
said
nick
it
from
me
chick
get
after
her
for
that
he
will
hate
her
more
than
before
the
knavish
rat
and
may
go
even
so
far
as
to
attempt
violence
by
keeping
an
eye
on
her
therefore
we
not
only
may
protect
her
but
also
pick
up
bart
bailey
himself
then
if
he
still
is
in
league
with
the
thieves
we
perhaps
may
trail
him
to
the
lair
of
the
entire
jove
no
fancy
chick
now
declared
with
some
enthusiasm
realty
looks
good
to
me
being
the
case
chick
you
had
better
tackle
that
string
to
our
bow
nick
directed
a
grip
with
what
you
may
need
for
a
few
days
and
go
in
disguise
to
the
lexington
avenue
house
in
which
helen
bailey
is
remain
there
temporarily
engage
a
room
and
board
if
possible
and
you
then
will
have
the
girl
right
under
your
eye
reveal
nothing
to
her
however
that
might
queer
an
opportunity
to
pick
up
her
me
to
have
foreseen
that
chick
replied
rising
be
ready
to
leave
in
ten
minutes
and
will
phone
you
enough
nick
said
approvingly
reference
may
be
required

the
landlady

case
she
rings
him
got
you
chick
nodded
turning
to
go
will
have
decided
by
how
patsy
and
i
can
best
begin
operations
nick
added
think
take
a
look
at
the
store
for
a
starter
and
at
a
few
of
its
nine
hundred
may
pick
the
crooks
from
the
nine
hundred
merely
by
their
looks
laughed
patsy
would
be
going
some
chief
for
chapter
iv
picking
up
a
trail
chick
carter
appeared
at
the
door
of
the
lexington
avenue
lodging
house
about
nine
that
evening
and
his
ring
was
answered
by
the
landlady
herself
one
hardy
to
whom
he
stated
his
mission
and
plausibly
explained
why
he
applied
to
her
at
that
hour
that
chick
made
a
favorable
impression
upon
the
woman
moreover
appeared
in
that
he
was
invited
to
enter
though
hardy
added
a
bit
doubtfully
have
only
one
vacant
room
at
present
sir
and
that
may
not
please
you
it
is
a
back
room
on
the
second
think
it
will
answer
chick
said
agreeably
can
not
say
just
how
long
i
may
remain
in
new
york
but
i
will
pay
you
liberally
for
the
time
i
am
here
my
name
is
fred
lamont
i
am
a
nephew
of
calvin
page
cashier
of
the
trinity
trust
company
you
can
talk
with
him
by
telephone
if
you
require
a
reference
and
he
will
assure
you
that
i
am
a
desirable
will
do
so
a
little
later
lamont
if
i
think
it
necessary
said
the
landlady
first
will
show
you
the
chick
accompanied
her
to
the
second
floor
and
into
a
small
but
neatly
furnished
back
chamber
in
front
is
occupied
by
a
young
lady
miss
helen
bailey
who
is
not
at
home
this
evening
hardy
observed
while
chick
was
glancing
around
the
room
has
gone
to
a
picture
show
with
a
girl
who
lives
a
block
south
from
chick
did
not
demur
over
taking
the
room
it
was
decidedly
satisfactory
to
him
in
fact
to
have
quarters
so
near
the
room
in
that
he
would
be
easily
able
to
keep
a
constant
eye
on
her
movements
when
at
home
and
to
learn
whether
she
was
visited
by
her
disreputable
brother
chick
took
the
room
at
once
therefore
paying
a
week
in
advance
and
inquired
while
doing
so
miss
bailey
frequently
have
visitors
in
the
evening
i
usually
retire
quite
early
her
room
is
so
near
mine
that
any
loud
conversation
might
disturb
me
no
exclaimed
hardy
with
a
shrug
bailey
has
only
two
gentlemen
callers
and
she
always
receives
them
in
the
all
right
then
said
chick
smiling
agreeably
could
pick
her
choice
from
most
men
lamont
as
far
as
that
goes
added
the
landlady
becoming
communicative
is
a
beautiful
girl
she
could
marry
the
son
of
one
of
the
wealthiest
merchants
in
new
york
if
she
wanted
to
or
another
one
of
the
firm
i
know
that
sir
though
you
may
think
it
of
the
firm
thought
chick
jove
that
must
be
goulard
father
and
son
would
not
be
rivals
besides
mantell
senior
now
has
a
wife
and
family
goulard
is
a
widower
however
and
this
may
be
worth
looking
chick
decided
not
to
display
any
undue
curiosity
at
that
time
he
left
his
suit
case
in
the
room
and
accompanied
hardy
downstairs
stating
that
he
had
business
outside
for
about
an
hour
when
he
would
return
and
he
then
left
the
house
three
minutes
later
found
him
in
the
vestibuled
doorway
of
a
dwelling
nearly
opposite
from
which
he
could
see
the
avenue
for
a
block
in
each
direction
chick
reasoned
in
view
of
suspicions
that
bart
bailey
might
already
have
heard
of
his
conduct
and
might
possibly
be
seeking
her
that
very
evening
particularly
if
impending
danger
necessitated
his
early
departure
from
the
city
chick
had
decided
in
fact
that
he
would
see
helen
bailey
home
after
she
parted
from
the
girl
who
had
accompanied
her
to
the
picture
show
he
knew
that
she
would
be
in
no
danger
while
having
a
companion
and
the
vantage
point
he
had
selected
enabled
him
to
watch
the
avenue
as
far
as
the
location
mentioned
by
the
landlady
not
return
later
than
eleven
if
she
has
gone
to
the
movies
he
said
to
himself
is
one
chance
in
a
hundred
at
least
that
bart
bailey
already
is
out
to
nail
her
take
that
one
chance
having
nothing
else
to
all
this
was
clever
work
on
the
part
of
the
carters
and
it
bore
not
unexpected
fruit
chick
had
been
waiting
less
than
half
an
hour
when
he
saw
a
slender
man
in
a
dark
suit
coming
down
the
avenue
whose
movements
immediately
warranted
suspicion
for
he
quickly
crossed
the
avenue
before
arriving
at
the
boarding
house
then
halted
on
the
opposite
side
and
gazed
intently
at
the
windows
jove
in
right
thought
chick
after
watching
him
for
several
moments
my
man
as
sure
as
juice
in
a
lemon
he
expected
to
find
the
girl
at
home
but
sees
that
her
room
is
not
lighted
lie
low
and
wait
for
her
taking
a
chance
that
return
alone
unless
much
chick
was
not
mistaken
bart
bailey
for
the
detective
had
rightly
identified
him
suddenly
recrossed
the
avenue
and
having
glanced
sharply
around
he
slunk
into
a
basement
doorway
under
the
rise
of
stone
steps
leading
up
to
the
front
door
of
the
boarding
house
he
intend
to
enter
or
will
he
wait
for
the
girl
chick
asked
himself
remain
here
until
she
comes
at
all
events
if
he
does
not
then
show
up
cross
over
and
enter
with
her
give
the
rat
no
chance
to
harm
her
let
come
what
uncertainty
was
not
of
long
duration
the
man
under
the
steps
if
still
there
continued
to
lie
low
twenty
minutes
passed
and
the
watching
detective
then
saw
two
girls
stop
at
a
house
nearly
a
block
away
he
could
see
them
quite
distinctly
the
avenue
in
that
locality
then
being
deserted
they
parted
after
a
few
moments
one
entering
the
house
the
other
hurrying
north
half
a
minute
brought
her
nearly
to
the
steps
from
under
which
darted
a
sinister
figure
that
immediately
blocked
her
way
chick
heard
the
cry
of
alarm
that
broke
from
her
as
well
as
what
followed
she
cried
shrinking
here
bet
here
the
reply
came
with
a
wolfish
snarl
have
let
get
me
would
you
you
what
do
you
mean
know
what
i
mean
have
given
me
to
the
guns
you
know
and
i
up
would
you
blat
my
name
from
the
housetops
i
believe
you
would
do
that
you
infernal
the
girl
shrank
from
the
uplifted
hand
from
the
fierce
threatening
look
in
his
fiery
eyes
speak
to
me
like
that
she
cried
striving
to
pass
him
and
reach
the
steps
you
dare
to
strike
me
scream
for
help
open
your
mouth
to
scream
hang
you
and
close
it
forever
bailey
fiercely
interrupted
have
given
me
to
the
guns
have
sent
me
up
me
pass
send
you
to
the
devil
for
it
teach
you
to
the
miscreant
got
no
farther
with
his
vicious
threats
chick
had
seen
him
reach
into
his
pocket
he
had
caught
the
glint
of
light
from
a
partly
drawn
blade
he
already
was
nearly
across
the
street
unobserved
by
either
and
he
now
whipped
out
his
revolver
and
uttered
a
shout
though
scarce
twenty
feet
from
the
couple
bent
only
upon
causing
bart
bailey
to
take
to
his
heels
that
out
he
shouted
the
girl
alone
or
in
thunder
are
you
the
ruffian
swung
round
with
an
oath
interrupting
and
chick
bounded
nearer
with
his
revolver
suddenly
leveled
leg
it
you
rascal
he
cried
while
a
scream
broke
from
the
frightened
girl
it
or
but
bart
bailey
already
was
legging
it
he
had
turned
the
instant
he
saw
the
weapon
and
was
darting
like
a
frightened
fox
up
the
avenue
crossing
it
diagonally
at
the
top
of
his
speed
and
making
for
the
nearest
corner
chick
sped
after
him
but
purposely
let
the
rascal
increase
his
lead
bent
upon
finally
trailing
him
without
being
suspected
bailey
rounded
the
corner
some
twenty
yards
in
advance
of
the
detective
and
continued
his
frantic
flight
chick
turned
the
corner
a
moment
later
he
saw
the
rascal
was
not
looking
back
he
darted
into
the
nearest
doorway
then
crouched
on
the
stone
steps
and
cautiously
peered
out
bart
bailey
was
crossing
the
street
still
at
the
top
of
his
speed
and
heading
for
third
avenue
suddenly
he
glanced
back
over
his
shoulder
and
discovered
that
he
no
longer
was
pursued
he
slowed
down
and
finally
stopped
gazing
back
and
listening
and
then
he
appeared
convinced
that
his
pursuer
had
stopped
before
turning
the
corner
as
if
to
give
vent
to
his
feelings
he
fiercely
shook
his
fist
in
the
direction
from
which
he
had
come
and
then
he
turned
on
his
heel
and
walked
away
chick
watched
him
until
he
rounded
the
corner
of
third
avenue
he
paused
only
to
be
sure
the
fellow
did
not
look
back
and
then
he
began
a
sprint
in
pursuit
of
the
scamp
he
arrived
at
the
corner
just
in
time
to
see
bailey
entering
an
opposite
saloon
by
jove
that
does
settle
it
he
said
to
himself
certainly
have
fooled
him
he
does
not
suspect
me
of
being
a
detective
or
he
would
have
continued
his
flight
he
probably
reasons
that
i
came
out
of
one
of
the
opposite
dwellings
and
turned
back
to
look
after
the
girl
it
should
be
soft
walking
now
to
trail
the
rascal
to
chick
had
prepared
himself
for
the
work
he
had
in
view
he
made
a
quick
change
of
disguise
then
crossed
the
avenue
and
looked
into
the
saloon
bart
bailey
was
gulping
down
a
glass
of
whisky
after
which
he
left
the
saloon
by
a
side
door
then
made
for
the
nearest
elevated
station
chick
followed
him
mounting
the
stairway
on
the
opposite
corner
from
that
taken
by
his
quarry
when
the
train
arrived
at
street
bailey
left
the
train
trailed
by
chick
the
young
rogue
ran
down
the
stairs
and
jumped
aboard
a
crosstown
car
chick
had
followed
his
quarry
and
both
dismounted
at
the
pennsylvania
station
where
bailey
got
a
suit
case
from
the
parcel
room
and
then
hastened
to
board
an
outbound
train
entering
the
smoking
car
and
taking
one
of
the
front
seats
chick
followed
him
and
took
one
in
the
middle
of
the
car
must
have
a
return
ticket
to
some
point
not
having
bought
one
he
said
to
himself
may
confirm
another
of
suspicions
that
the
stolen
merchandise
is
being
shipped
to
another
city
and
that
bailey
still
is
in
league
with
the
gang
in
some
capacity
soon
find
out
where
going
since
up
to
me
to
go
with
chick
conferred
quietly
with
the
conductor
half
an
hour
later
when
the
fast
express
was
speeding
south
confiding
his
identity
and
stating
what
he
wanted
to
learn
later
when
the
conductor
came
through
the
train
to
punch
the
tickets
he
paused
briefly
and
whispered
to
the
detective
has
a
return
ticket
to
philadelphia
the
date
shows
that
it
was
purchased
day
before
chick
thanked
him
and
now
paid
his
fare
philadelphia
for
mine
also
he
remarked
smiling
significantly
was
all
at
sea
as
to
where
i
was
going
glad
to
find
the
conductor
laughed
quietly
and
moved
on
through
the
train
it
was
long
after
midnight
when
chick
shadowed
bailey
from
the
pennsylvania
station
in
philadelphia
to
a
hotel
in
arch
street
where
his
quarry
evidently
already
was
quartered
for
he
stopped
only
for
a
key
and
several
letters
which
the
clerk
took
from
a
pigeonhole
and
gave
him
and
he
then
went
up
to
his
room
chick
entered
a
moment
later
and
registered
under
a
fictitious
name
that
tom
denny
who
came
in
just
ahead
of
me
he
inquired
carelessly
the
clerk
shook
his
head
was
arthur
finley
i
know
tom
a
traveling
salesman
with
whom
acquainted
i
thought
i
recognized
were
mistaken
finley
has
been
living
here
for
several
months
a
buyer
for
rudolph
meyer
who
runs
a
general
store
in
broad
chick
turned
away
and
went
up
with
a
hallboy
to
the
room
assigned
him
for
rudolph
meyer
eh
he
said
to
himself
with
a
feeling
of
grim
satisfaction
wager
that
all
of
the
goods
with
which
he
supplies
rudolph
meyer
come
indirectly
from
the
store
of
mantell
goulard
look
into
that
in
the
morning
and
then
have
a
talk
with
nick
his
suspicions
have
hit
the
nail
on
the
head
all
right
and
should
see
something
chapter
nick
finds
a
clew
nick
carter
did
not
receive
the
expected
telephone
communication
from
chick
the
following
morning
bent
upon
learning
why
and
apprehending
that
something
of
a
sensational
nature
had
occurred
the
previous
night
nick
called
at
the
lexington
avenue
boarding
house
about
half
past
eight
and
asked
to
see
the
landlady
hardy
joined
him
in
her
parlor
a
few
moments
later
drying
her
hands
and
arms
with
her
apron
have
called
to
inquire
about
lamont
said
nick
after
closing
the
door
understand
me
hardy
interrupted
gazing
more
than
i
can
say
very
glad
if
any
one
understands
and
will
explain
nick
replied
smiling
thought
something
had
occurred
i
probably
can
explain
to
your
entire
satisfaction
what
about
lamont
what
mystifies
you
sir
he
engaged
a
room
here
last
night
and
left
his
suit
case
saying
he
would
return
in
about
an
hour
he
did
not
do
so
nor
have
i
heard
from
him
i
have
telephoned
to
a
gentleman
to
whom
he
referred
me
and
who
stated
that
he
is
entirely
probably
refer
to
calvin
page
his
sir
i
do
but
i
can
not
account
for
disappearance
do
you
know
anything
about
him
know
all
about
him
madam
said
nick
any
thing
occur
here
last
night
that
might
have
occasioned
his
absence
no
sir
nothing
occurred
in
the
perhaps
know
only
that
one
of
my
boarders
helen
bailey
was
assaulted
by
a
man
about
eleven
as
she
was
approaching
the
door
a
stranger
ran
across
the
avenue
and
drove
the
miscreant
away
then
pursued
him
around
the
corner
neither
of
them
returned
i
think
the
stranger
was
lamont
however
for
he
answer
miss
description
of
her
in
another
disguise
thought
nick
game
opened
even
more
quickly
than
i
hardy
then
was
gazing
at
him
quite
suspiciously
and
nick
decided
to
take
her
into
his
confidence
he
briefly
explained
the
situation
and
the
probable
circumstances
much
to
the
relief
and
increasing
interest
in
her
visitor
whom
she
now
regarded
in
an
entirely
different
light
me
she
exclaimed
did
not
even
dream
carter
that
you
were
the
famous
detective
i
think
miss
bailey
even
suspected
that
her
protector
was
one
of
your
she
say
anything
more
about
the
matter
than
you
have
stated
nick
inquired
sir
only
what
i
have
told
must
not
do
so
then
nor
mention
what
i
have
told
you
nick
directed
more
impressively
nothing
whatever
about
the
matter
to
any
carter
your
instructions
come
too
late
sir
i
already
have
told
one
have
you
told
gaston
did
you
happen
to
inform
him
asked
nick
both
surprised
and
suspicious
called
here
this
morning
he
frequently
stops
with
his
automobile
when
on
his
way
to
business
to
take
miss
bailey
to
the
telephone
exchange
she
had
gone
before
he
arrived
however
and
i
then
told
him
about
lamont
thinking
he
might
know
the
man
or
suggest
some
explanation
for
his
goulard
friendly
with
miss
bailey
nick
inquired
with
brows
knitting
slightly
sir
but
only
in
a
paternal
way
i
think
he
is
much
older
than
she
and
i
imagine
that
he
is
interested
in
her
only
because
of
young
mantell
the
son
of
his
business
partner
mantell
is
deeply
in
love
with
did
you
tell
goulard
about
the
assault
nick
inquired
what
i
have
stated
to
her
assailant
was
pursued
by
the
stranger
you
tell
him
that
the
stranger
did
not
return
did
did
goulard
say
about
that
appeared
quite
did
he
say
nick
repeated
i
think
i
remember
hardy
faltered
said
nothing
that
made
any
impression
on
me
he
asked
whether
helen
recognized
the
man
or
gave
me
a
description
of
him
when
i
had
told
him
all
i
knew
about
the
matter
he
rushed
out
to
his
automobile
and
rode
rapidly
away
with
his
rapidly
than
usual
sir
much
more
to
tell
the
truth
carter
i
felt
almost
sure
that
he
suspected
the
nick
thought
so
too
but
he
did
not
say
so
he
at
once
suspected
also
that
goulard
had
hastened
to
the
telephone
exchange
to
question
helen
bailey
and
ten
minutes
later
he
entered
in
disguise
and
confirmed
his
suspicions
revealing
his
identity
of
course
he
learned
from
helen
that
goulard
had
questioned
her
very
closely
about
the
man
who
had
pursued
her
brother
and
that
he
then
had
hurriedly
departed
he
know
that
you
were
arrested
yesterday
morning
miss
bailey
and
for
what
nick
then
inquired
sir
he
does
said
helen
informed
him
read
about
it
in
one
of
the
he
question
you
about
it
in
a
general
way
carter
helen
readily
admitted
then
added
more
earnestly
he
appeared
much
interested
in
what
occurred
last
likely
said
nick
a
bit
dryly
he
decided
not
to
reveal
any
of
his
increasing
suspicions
however
but
returned
immediately
to
his
business
office
where
he
found
patsy
garvan
awaiting
him
and
told
him
what
he
had
learned
listens
good
to
me
chief
declared
patsy
with
some
enthusiasm
dead
open
and
shut
now
that
chick
has
a
line
on
bart
why
we
heard
from
him
may
have
prevented
him
from
communicating
with
us
or
he
may
be
seeking
additional
evidence
before
doing
so
nick
rightly
reasoned
so
patsy
agreed
eating
goulard
why
was
he
so
haired
up
over
it
is
he
in
love
with
helen
bailey
evidently
is
one
reason
said
nick
denies
that
she
has
given
him
any
encouragement
however
beyond
accepting
a
ride
to
and
from
her
place
of
business
occasionally
she
states
that
he
has
always
treated
her
respectfully
i
would
not
care
to
trust
goulard
with
such
a
girl
nevertheless
much
farther
than
i
could
throw
i
chief
as
far
as
that
goes
said
patsy
half
like
his
may
be
a
more
serious
cause
for
his
being
haired
up
as
you
term
it
nick
added
refer
to
the
robberies
think
he
may
be
the
man
behind
the
gun
begin
to
think
so
said
nick
is
quite
possible
that
he
is
engaged
in
a
big
scheme
to
defraud
his
own
partner
you
observed
last
evening
no
doubt
that
he
was
quite
anxious
to
know
what
investigations
i
intended
to
make
and
he
insisted
that
i
must
keep
him
informed
of
my
bet
i
noticed
that
said
patsy
is
significant
too
as
far
as
it
true
even
if
my
suspicions
are
correct
however
it
may
not
prove
easy
to
fix
such
treachery
upon
one
of
the
firm
and
to
round
up
his
right
there
is
one
fact
on
which
we
can
depend
and
of
which
we
can
take
is
that
chief
four
persons
are
supposed
to
know
that
we
are
engaged
on
the
case
said
nick
are
the
two
members
of
the
firm
also
frank
mantell
and
the
assistant
general
manager
lombard
i
directed
that
no
one
else
should
be
remember
nodded
patsy
if
either
of
them
has
a
hand
in
these
robberies
he
will
evidently
reason
that
the
thefts
must
not
abruptly
cease
or
we
would
immediately
attribute
it
to
the
fact
that
we
are
making
an
investigation
and
the
crooks
have
become
alarmed
that
would
of
course
involve
one
or
more
of
the
four
men
who
know
we
are
looking
into
the
thing
agreed
patsy
as
plain
as
twice
therefore
the
thefts
will
continue
nick
confidently
predicted
is
up
to
us
then
to
catch
the
thieves
in
the
act
or
at
least
discover
who
is
doing
the
work
and
how
the
goods
are
removed
from
the
store
we
ought
to
be
able
to
accomplish
that
said
patsy
will
undertake
it
at
all
events
while
chick
is
following
up
bart
bailey
slip
two
or
three
changes
of
disguise
into
your
pocket
patsy
and
go
to
the
department
store
find
goulard
and
keep
an
eye
on
him
till
otherwise
do
that
all
right
but
what
are
your
own
plans
not
sure
what
turn
they
will
take
said
nick
shall
follow
you
to
the
store
in
disguise
and
look
over
the
ground
what
i
observe
may
determine
what
more
i
shall
that
as
it
may
i
shall
run
across
you
and
then
may
have
other
instructions
to
give
got
you
chief
said
patsy
hastening
to
make
ready
i
act
on
my
own
judgment
in
case
i
detect
anything
suspicious
nick
nodded
nothing
however
that
would
expose
our
guard
against
that
ahead
when
you
are
ready
then
and
keep
a
sharp
eye
on
gaston
it
was
nearly
noon
when
patsy
entered
the
vast
department
store
where
the
morning
business
then
was
in
full
swing
all
of
the
several
floors
being
thronged
with
customers
probably
find
goulard
in
the
business
office
or
in
that
locality
he
said
to
himself
then
bent
only
upon
locating
his
man
have
a
look
in
that
though
familiar
with
the
store
in
a
general
way
patsy
knew
but
little
about
its
numerous
departments
fortune
favored
him
however
in
that
he
sauntered
toward
the
rear
of
the
store
and
unexpectedly
discovered
the
man
he
was
seeking
goulard
was
hurrying
up
from
one
of
the
basement
rooms
in
company
with
a
florid
man
of
nearly
fifty
both
appeared
disturbed
goulard
was
talking
excitedly
and
flourishing
several
foreign
invoices
the
character
of
which
patsy
readily
detected
playing
lucky
he
said
to
himself
is
something
doing
he
followed
the
two
men
to
the
second
floor
on
which
the
extensive
offices
were
located
including
the
private
offices
of
the
firm
and
assistant
managers
all
were
in
the
rear
of
the
vast
building
but
adjoined
the
extensive
salesroom
which
enabled
patsy
to
follow
the
two
men
without
attracting
attention
he
saw
them
enter
the
nearest
of
the
several
private
offices
which
were
divided
by
a
corridor
from
the
large
general
office
and
a
moment
later
hard
aggressive
voice
could
be
plainly
heard
through
the
partly
open
door
is
no
question
about
it
none
whatever
he
declared
is
right
mantell
two
of
the
persian
shawls
are
missing
i
have
checked
off
every
article
found
in
the
packing
cases
and
tenney
the
receiving
clerk
is
positive
that
none
was
mislaid
the
invoice
is
correct
in
every
particular
save
that
two
of
the
persian
shawls
are
missing
there
goes
another
two
hundred
dollars
to
the
dogs
by
heaven
close
the
store
or
sell
my
interest
in
it
if
this
kind
of
thing
theft
thought
patsy
pausing
at
the
entrance
to
the
corridor
chief
was
right
by
jove
in
that
the
robberies
will
continue
in
spite
of
us
that
must
be
the
senior
private
the
last
was
confirmed
by
the
reply
to
heated
declarations
lose
your
head
gaston
you
suffer
no
more
than
i
over
these
depredations
we
are
equal
partners
in
the
business
bear
in
mind
that
we
now
have
nick
carter
on
the
case
and
he
be
hanged
goulard
interrupted
bluntly
he
showed
up
this
morning
if
he
him
time
put
in
another
voice
which
patsy
recognized
to
be
that
of
frank
mantell
know
goulard
what
he
stated
last
snapped
goulard
state
anything
he
said
only
that
he
would
look
into
the
matter
why
he
doing
it
close
that
door
lombard
we
may
be
heard
in
the
patsy
heard
the
door
closed
and
the
voices
of
the
men
within
no
longer
reached
his
ears
it
was
obvious
to
him
however
that
they
were
discussing
a
robbery
committed
that
morning
evidently
from
a
package
of
imported
merchandise
that
had
been
opened
in
the
receiving
room
bent
only
upon
watching
goulard
as
nick
had
directed
patsy
waited
briefly
within
view
of
the
office
door
toward
which
he
presently
sauntered
noting
that
the
corridor
ran
toward
the
rear
of
the
building
and
to
a
narrow
diverging
corridor
and
stairway
leading
down
to
a
court
making
in
from
the
side
street
wait
and
see
where
he
goes
after
leaving
office
he
said
to
himself
not
venturing
to
play
the
eavesdropper
at
the
closed
door
probably
will
return
to
the
salesroom
or
some
other
part
of
the
store
ah
this
must
be
his
private
it
was
the
last
in
the
corridor
and
a
plate
on
the
door
bore
name
the
door
was
partly
open
and
patsy
glanced
in
pausing
for
a
moment
he
saw
a
handsomely
equipped
office
with
a
large
desk
then
open
and
covered
with
accumulated
letters
bills
and
invoices
turning
into
the
diverging
back
corridor
which
afforded
him
a
corner
for
concealment
patsy
then
observed
that
another
door
led
from
office
into
the
rear
corridor
a
fact
which
did
not
then
impress
him
seriously
he
scarce
had
turned
the
corner
however
when
he
heard
the
steps
of
the
two
men
in
the
other
corridor
they
were
coming
in
his
direction
and
discretion
at
first
impelled
him
to
dart
toward
the
back
stairway
as
he
could
not
plausibly
explain
his
presence
in
this
rear
corridor
which
was
but
little
used
and
only
by
persons
employed
in
the
store
lingering
for
a
moment
nevertheless
patsy
heard
the
men
suddenly
stop
at
the
door
of
office
they
remained
in
whispered
conversation
for
several
minutes
inaudible
to
patsy
though
he
then
heard
one
of
them
walk
quickly
away
through
the
main
corridor
while
the
other
entered
private
office
patsy
heard
the
door
closed
and
the
steps
of
the
man
within
and
he
still
lingered
and
listened
it
goulard
himself
he
questioned
mentally
else
would
be
in
his
office
i
must
find
a
concealment
from
which
i
can
watch
the
other
patsy
found
it
under
the
rise
of
stairs
to
the
third
floor
a
dusty
corner
from
which
he
could
see
a
portion
of
both
corridors
he
had
been
waiting
about
ten
minutes
when
much
to
his
surprise
another
man
emerged
from
office
and
appeared
in
the
back
corridor
he
was
a
bowed
man
in
a
gray
suit
and
entirely
unlike
the
fashionable
garments
worn
by
the
junior
member
of
the
firm
he
appeared
to
be
about
sixty
a
man
with
grizzled
hair
a
full
beard
and
wearing
spectacles
he
paused
for
a
moment
glancing
sharply
toward
the
stairs
and
then
he
closed
the
rear
door
from
which
he
had
come
and
hastened
toward
the
stairway
beats
me
thought
patsy
sure
there
was
no
one
in
that
office
when
i
looked
into
it
and
who
but
goulard
would
have
entered
it
who
the
dickens
is
this
fellow
then
and
why
patsy
did
not
continue
his
train
of
thought
he
decided
that
the
matter
needed
immediate
investigation
he
darted
to
the
rear
door
of
the
office
again
and
listened
not
a
sound
came
from
within
stepping
around
to
the
other
door
bent
upon
knocking
and
learning
positively
whether
goulard
was
within
patsy
now
found
on
the
door
a
written
card
return
at
two
scott
thought
patsy
startled
here
when
i
passed
this
door
can
it
be
he
did
not
end
the
thought
he
turned
abruptly
darting
through
the
rear
corridor
and
down
the
back
stairway
now
in
hot
pursuit
of
the
bearded
man
in
gray
chapter
vi
the
code
telegram
chick
carter
was
on
the
lookout
for
bart
bailey
at
seven
the
following
morning
after
trailing
him
to
philadelphia
he
had
felt
sure
that
his
quarry
would
not
be
stirring
before
that
hour
but
he
soon
found
that
he
had
allowed
himself
but
little
leeway
for
bailey
appeared
in
the
hotel
office
ten
minutes
later
and
hurried
in
to
breakfast
chick
saw
plainly
that
the
rascal
did
not
suspect
an
espionage
but
his
haste
denoted
that
he
had
important
business
in
view
chick
determined
not
to
lose
sight
of
him
therefore
and
he
deferred
for
that
reason
and
in
order
to
gather
additional
evidence
a
telephone
talk
with
nick
precisely
as
the
latter
had
inferred
chick
shadowed
bailey
from
the
hotel
about
eight
and
the
store
mentioned
by
the
clerk
the
previous
night
it
proved
to
be
a
small
establishment
occupying
only
the
ground
floor
and
basement
of
a
corner
building
with
an
office
in
the
rear
and
to
which
the
crook
immediately
hastened
not
follow
him
thought
chick
sizing
up
the
store
from
outside
may
get
a
line
on
him
from
the
hastening
in
that
direction
chick
saw
that
the
back
windows
of
an
automobile
agency
overlooked
a
paved
area
back
of
store
and
he
entered
and
introduced
himself
to
the
manager
confiding
the
situation
to
him
and
requesting
the
privilege
of
using
the
rear
windows
certainly
carter
he
readily
consented
after
chick
had
concluded
as
far
as
you
like
i
bank
much
myself
as
a
matter
of
fact
on
rudolph
integrity
i
know
he
used
to
run
a
pawnshop
in
one
of
the
lower
precincts
of
the
city
he
opened
this
store
about
eight
months
after
the
new
york
robberies
began
chick
nodded
see
the
point
i
have
often
wondered
why
he
could
sell
goods
cheaper
than
his
competitors
i
inferred
that
his
rent
might
be
lower
and
he
keeps
only
one
clerk
a
man
named
of
his
goods
cost
him
less
at
present
chick
said
significantly
judge
so
now
smiled
the
other
unpack
most
of
them
in
the
area
back
of
the
store
a
big
case
came
in
there
this
morning
by
express
it
now
is
out
there
i
suppose
they
will
open
it
now
that
finley
has
showed
up
yes
by
jove
just
coming
out
of
the
rear
chick
directed
the
manager
to
remain
in
his
office
and
he
then
stole
to
a
point
from
which
he
could
easily
see
and
hear
the
two
men
without
being
detected
they
had
emerged
from
a
back
door
of
the
store
and
had
opened
another
leading
down
a
flight
of
stone
steps
to
the
basement
barton
bailey
already
was
working
upon
a
large
packing
case
while
rudolph
meyers
a
short
swarthy
man
of
about
fifty
stood
looking
on
with
a
sinister
grin
vindfall
eh
he
remarked
after
a
moment
vindfall
if
it
proves
to
be
as
good
as
the
last
better
meyers
and
then
some
bart
bailey
interrupted
turning
from
his
work
happen
to
know
just
what
is
in
this
one
i
was
with
murdock
when
the
goods
were
left
him
all
right
eh
right
as
a
trivet
one
is
yet
wise
eh
yet
old
man
nor
likely
to
be
declared
bart
confidently
headquarters
dicks
have
been
bounced
and
others
are
to
be
tried
you
know
whom
i
mean
the
worst
ever
too
but
i
reckon
find
this
nut
too
hard
a
one
for
their
ugly
jaws
if
they
cut
in
meyers
sharply
vas
a
poy
with
a
message
vait
von
chick
pricked
up
his
ears
and
crept
nearer
the
window
through
the
open
back
door
of
the
store
he
could
see
a
telegraph
messenger
entering
from
broad
street
he
saw
meyers
hurry
in
to
meet
him
saw
him
glance
at
the
address
on
the
yellow
envelope
and
then
turn
and
beckon
to
bailey
who
dropped
his
tools
and
hurried
into
the
store
jove
i
wonder
what
that
signifies
thought
chick
with
instinctive
misgivings
wire
to
bailey
eh
can
any
one
have
got
wise
to
my
doings
bart
bailey
to
whom
the
telegram
evidently
was
addressed
hastened
to
sign
for
it
and
then
broke
the
seal
he
read
the
message
and
then
both
men
hurried
into
the
rear
office
chick
then
could
see
them
through
one
of
the
office
windows
which
had
been
opened
to
admit
the
morning
air
bart
bailey
took
a
small
leather
book
from
his
pocket
and
sat
down
at
a
desk
spreading
the
telegram
on
it
and
seizing
a
large
pad
of
blank
paper
and
a
pencil
he
then
began
to
refer
to
various
pages
in
the
book
pausing
to
write
briefly
at
intervals
on
the
pad
code
message
thought
chick
intently
watching
the
couple
has
the
key
to
it
in
that
book
and
is
making
a
transcription
on
the
pad
by
jove
this
looks
like
something
suspicions
were
almost
immediately
confirmed
both
men
appeared
much
disturbed
leaving
barton
still
at
work
at
the
desk
meyers
hurried
to
the
front
part
of
the
store
where
through
some
lace
draperies
that
were
displayed
in
one
of
the
windows
he
began
to
peer
cautiously
into
broad
street
evidently
searching
the
wide
thoroughfare
in
each
direction
gracious
i
must
be
right
chick
muttered
bailey
has
been
tipped
by
some
one
as
sure
as
death
and
taxes
the
other
rat
is
looking
to
see
whether
the
store
is
being
watched
looking
in
the
wrong
direction
old
man
by
jove
i
would
give
a
trifle
for
a
copy
of
that
bart
bailey
evidently
completed
it
a
few
moments
later
he
sprang
up
in
some
excitement
tore
the
written
sheet
from
the
pad
then
hurried
out
to
the
front
of
the
store
to
read
it
to
his
companion
both
remained
there
earnestly
discussing
it
and
gazing
cautiously
toward
the
street
my
chance
by
jove
if
i
ever
had
one
thought
chick
after
watching
them
for
a
moment
take
it
too
let
come
what
stepping
quickly
to
one
of
the
other
windows
chick
quietly
raised
it
then
sprang
out
noiselessly
and
crossed
the
area
between
the
two
buildings
the
desk
in
the
rear
office
was
within
reach
through
the
open
window
chick
leaned
over
the
sill
and
listened
for
a
moment
he
could
hear
the
subdued
voices
of
the
two
men
in
the
front
of
the
store
but
could
not
distinguish
what
they
were
saying
taking
the
pad
from
the
desk
chick
drew
back
and
tore
off
the
upper
blank
sheet
and
slipped
it
into
his
pocket
he
then
replaced
the
pad
and
returned
it
to
its
former
position
quietly
closing
the
window
the
two
men
in
the
front
of
the
store
still
were
cautiously
watching
the
street
of
them
heard
me
thought
chick
with
some
satisfaction
will
a
single
blank
sheet
be
missed
from
that
pad
wager
i
can
learn
something
from
one
might
wonder
how
he
could
accomplish
it
but
chick
carter
was
wise
to
all
the
tricks
of
his
profession
he
thanked
the
manager
of
the
agency
for
the
accommodations
afforded
him
cautioned
him
to
say
nothing
in
regard
to
his
visit
and
he
then
learned
the
location
of
the
nearest
drug
store
hastening
to
it
chick
bought
from
a
clerk
some
fine
black
powder
adapted
to
his
purpose
he
then
requested
the
privilege
of
using
the
prescription
room
for
a
few
moments
stating
with
what
object
and
the
favor
was
readily
granted
chick
then
spread
the
blank
sheet
of
paper
on
a
table
and
covered
it
with
a
thin
layer
of
the
fine
black
dust
which
he
then
blew
gently
from
its
surface
particles
of
it
remained
however
in
the
indentations
caused
by
the
pressure
of
the
pencil
through
the
sheet
on
which
bart
bailey
had
been
writing
and
it
brought
out
quite
legibly
nearly
every
word
of
the
transcription
hurriedly
made
by
the
crook
chick
read
it
carefully
quick
to
readily
interpret
the
condensed
phrases
transcribed
from
the
code
book
and
he
found
that
it
fully
confirmed
his
suspicions
it
told
him
that
bart
bailey
had
been
warned
that
a
detective
was
following
him
that
he
must
watch
out
for
him
and
lure
him
to
new
york
if
possible
and
to
some
place
designated
only
as
a
cobweb
the
communication
bore
no
signature
whatever
chick
carter
smiled
a
bit
grimly
now
knocking
the
particles
of
dust
from
the
sheet
and
returning
it
to
his
pocket
the
circumstances
nevertheless
puzzled
him
somewhat
the
dickens
could
have
learned
of
my
doings
and
warned
this
rascal
he
said
to
himself
helen
bailey
surely
nor
the
landlady
neither
of
them
would
have
done
so
be
hanged
if
i
now
can
fathom
it
but
i
reckon
i
see
my
way
to
doing
so
lure
me
to
new
york
eh
i
can
guess
what
that
means
all
right
well
give
the
rats
a
most
men
would
have
shrunk
from
the
risks
involved
but
not
chick
carter
he
now
hastened
to
find
a
clothing
store
where
he
clad
himself
in
a
somewhat
seedy
suit
and
a
woolen
cap
directing
that
his
own
discarded
garments
should
be
sent
to
his
new
york
address
ten
minutes
later
wearing
an
entirely
different
facial
disguise
and
having
a
rather
sinister
appearance
chick
returned
to
broad
street
and
entered
store
he
then
found
both
suspects
engaged
in
hurriedly
putting
into
various
shelves
and
drawers
the
goods
taken
from
the
packing
case
which
had
been
opened
during
his
brief
absence
both
at
once
ceased
working
when
he
entered
and
chick
saw
that
he
was
instantly
suspected
he
saw
too
that
bailey
shot
a
swift
significant
glance
at
meyers
plainly
directing
him
not
to
interfere
the
boss
around
chick
inquired
as
he
approached
them
bart
bailey
nodded
hooking
his
thumbs
through
the
armholes
of
his
vest
while
he
replied
inquiringly
am
the
boss
my
man
what
do
you
want
looking
for
a
job
sir
said
chick
respectfully
touching
his
cap
with
his
forefinger
thought
mebbe
i
would
give
you
employment
bart
put
in
with
searching
scrutiny
led
you
to
think
so
sir
save
that
most
stores
need
help
chick
explained
quite
humbly
have
been
trying
for
a
job
in
others
sir
but
luck
seems
against
me
broke
and
in
hard
sledding
you
see
and
you
live
in
the
city
bart
cut
in
again
sir
here
from
chicago
only
a
couple
of
did
you
leave
there
boss
failed
and
that
threw
me
out
of
a
job
i
get
another
in
chicago
so
i
worked
my
way
here
on
a
freight
sort
of
work
can
you
do
old
kind
sir
earn
me
a
dollar
chick
asserted
somewhat
suggestively
be
particular
you
can
bet
on
do
most
anything
eh
what
i
would
sir
when
a
up
against
it
good
and
hard
he
stick
over
trifles
do
anything
the
boss
told
it
was
something
off
color
would
be
up
to
him
sir
do
it
all
right
and
shut
my
eyes
to
what
it
was
your
mouth
too
perhaps
would
sir
and
keep
it
shut
said
chick
with
a
sinister
nod
can
bank
your
pile
on
that
bart
bailey
laughed
and
glanced
again
at
the
listening
merchant
might
use
the
fellow
he
remarked
significantly
yes
he
might
meyers
allowed
tentatively
evidently
taking
a
cue
the
other
had
given
him
bart
turned
to
chick
again
saying
got
no
use
for
you
here
my
man
but
i
think
i
could
find
a
job
for
you
in
new
would
suit
me
all
right
sir
chick
declared
with
manifest
eagerness
go
to
new
york
sir
or
to
perdition
if
need
be
give
me
a
letter
to
the
party
sir
and
find
a
way
to
get
do
better
than
that
my
man
if
you
mean
what
you
say
replied
bailey
glancing
at
his
watch
find
i
mean
it
sir
chick
insisted
going
to
new
york
in
just
half
an
hour
bart
added
not
promise
you
the
job
mind
you
but
i
think
i
can
fix
you
with
a
friend
who
wants
a
man
for
general
work
take
the
chance
at
all
events
and
will
pay
your
fare
which
can
be
returned
to
me
out
of
your
first
pay
how
does
that
suit
you
be
hit
more
to
my
liking
sir
said
chick
with
manifest
gratitude
more
obliged
than
i
could
tell
if
i
mind
thanking
me
bart
interrupted
be
time
enough
for
that
after
you
get
coming
to
you
your
name
donovan
are
you
stopping
have
you
got
any
luggage
on
my
easily
carried
bart
laughed
with
a
covert
gleam
in
his
shifty
eyes
down
there
donovan
for
about
ten
minutes
we
then
shall
have
time
to
hit
a
fast
chick
obeyed
him
with
alacrity
taking
a
chair
to
which
the
rascal
pointed
there
was
nothing
remarkable
in
the
celerity
with
which
these
arrangements
were
completed
chick
knew
that
the
two
crooks
did
not
dream
of
his
having
learned
of
the
code
telegram
and
its
significance
and
that
they
not
only
would
suspect
his
identity
but
also
would
see
in
his
application
for
work
only
a
scheme
to
watch
them
and
the
philadelphia
store
that
he
would
walk
with
open
eyes
into
such
a
net
as
the
telegram
indirectly
suggested
would
seem
utterly
improbable
and
bart
bailey
had
immediately
seized
the
supposed
opportunity
which
the
situation
presented
feeling
sure
that
he
could
trap
chick
before
he
could
learn
that
his
identity
and
designs
were
suspected
half
an
hour
later
therefore
found
both
seated
in
the
smoking
car
of
an
express
train
bound
for
new
york
whither
chick
had
really
expected
to
have
taken
the
crook
in
irons
instead
of
traveling
as
his
supposed
dupe
this
appeared
to
chick
nevertheless
the
surest
and
speediest
way
to
discover
the
identity
and
doings
of
confederates
as
well
as
to
round
up
the
entire
gang
which
might
possibly
be
perverted
by
the
immediate
arrest
of
bailey
and
rudolph
meyers
it
was
early
afternoon
when
they
arrived
in
new
york
each
having
played
his
part
consistently
resulting
in
no
material
change
in
the
situation
save
a
change
of
base
take
a
taxi
said
bailey
as
they
emerged
from
the
station
got
the
beats
working
passage
on
a
freight
train
chick
replied
you
say
finley
way
chick
followed
him
to
a
taxicab
to
the
driver
of
which
the
crook
quietly
gave
his
instructions
the
taxicab
stopped
in
front
of
an
unpretentious
store
in
one
of
the
crosstown
streets
the
single
front
window
denoted
that
wooden
toys
and
novelties
of
like
description
were
sold
within
a
sign
over
the
door
apparently
told
the
whole
story
novelty
chick
glanced
at
the
sign
and
window
when
he
followed
bart
bailey
from
the
taxicab
beyond
the
low
brick
building
in
which
this
store
was
located
the
two
upper
floors
of
which
were
evidently
used
for
a
dwelling
towered
the
rear
wall
of
a
vast
mercantile
edifice
which
chick
immediately
recognized
department
store
he
said
to
himself
jove
this
should
signify
way
bart
bailey
spoke
with
a
growl
a
move
chick
did
not
hesitate
he
followed
the
ruffian
without
replying
and
entered
the
quarters
of
the
acme
novelty
company
chapter
vii
into
a
net
chick
carter
sized
up
the
interior
of
the
store
with
a
glance
he
saw
that
it
was
not
used
for
a
retail
business
several
empty
cases
stood
on
the
floor
while
a
nondescript
array
of
toys
and
novelties
of
cheap
variety
filled
the
shelves
and
single
counter
all
more
or
less
dusty
and
in
some
disorder
the
only
visible
occupant
of
the
place
was
a
burly
powerful
man
of
middle
age
with
reddish
hair
and
features
and
with
his
shirt
sleeves
rolled
above
the
elbows
of
his
brawny
arms
he
was
clad
in
overalls
and
appeared
to
be
engaged
in
drawing
nails
from
a
cover
of
one
of
the
empty
cases
back
again
finley
he
exclaimed
in
guttural
tones
when
the
two
men
entered
at
the
same
time
bestowing
an
indifferent
glance
upon
chick
nolan
but
only
for
the
day
bart
bailey
replied
murdock
around
in
the
enough
i
hoped
i
would
find
him
here
shake
hands
with
donovan
looking
for
a
job
and
i
have
an
idea
that
murdock
can
use
reckon
that
we
can
use
him
all
right
nolan
vouchsafed
with
covert
significance
want
to
get
the
right
kind
of
a
think
i
can
fill
the
bill
said
chick
while
he
shook
the
tendered
hand
here
donovan
put
in
bailey
find
out
what
murdock
thinks
about
ahead
sir
chick
nodded
bart
turned
to
the
rear
of
the
store
and
vanished
down
a
narrow
stairway
kind
of
work
is
to
be
required
of
me
chick
inquired
turning
again
to
nolan
jobs
was
the
indefinite
reply
packing
the
stuff
we
send
away
we
do
any
retail
murdock
run
the
business
here
nodded
nolan
the
big
does
he
buy
all
of
these
things
chick
inquired
glancing
at
the
counter
and
shelves
buy
them
said
nolan
tersely
make
most
of
them
got
a
workroom
in
the
might
what
chick
would
have
said
was
cut
short
by
a
shout
from
below
a
command
from
bart
bailey
donovan
down
here
nolan
he
cried
wants
to
talk
with
right
nolan
shouted
then
to
chick
turn
the
key
in
the
door
some
one
might
steal
in
and
swipe
he
strode
to
the
street
door
and
locked
it
while
speaking
and
chick
quick
to
note
the
significance
of
all
this
seized
the
opportunity
presented
he
shifted
a
revolver
to
the
side
pocket
of
his
coat
then
followed
nolan
down
the
narrow
back
stairway
it
led
to
a
basement
room
of
moderate
size
with
a
cement
floor
and
lighted
with
several
incandescent
lamps
in
none
of
the
four
foundation
walls
that
met
gaze
was
there
any
sign
of
a
window
in
one
corner
however
a
stairway
led
up
to
another
part
of
the
building
near
one
of
the
walls
stood
a
long
wooden
bench
covered
with
tools
and
partly
finished
articles
such
as
chick
had
seen
in
the
store
aside
from
this
bench
two
common
wooden
chairs
and
a
bare
table
the
room
contained
no
furnishings
worthy
of
mention
a
workman
with
his
sleeves
rolled
up
a
muscular
chap
in
the
twenties
was
leaning
on
the
bench
with
a
mallet
in
his
hand
bart
bailey
was
seated
on
a
corner
of
the
table
near
by
occupying
one
of
the
chairs
was
a
bearded
man
in
gray
the
man
whom
patsy
garvan
had
followed
from
the
department
store
only
a
short
time
before
nolan
stepped
aside
to
let
chick
pass
and
the
latter
quickly
noticed
that
he
did
not
return
to
the
store
it
was
too
significant
a
fact
to
be
ignored
and
chick
was
never
more
alert
than
at
that
moment
way
donovan
bailey
said
a
bit
curtly
is
murdock
i
have
told
him
about
you
he
wants
to
ask
you
a
few
right
sir
said
chick
to
know
you
good
sit
down
murdock
pointed
to
the
only
vacant
chair
it
was
directly
in
front
of
him
and
scarce
three
feet
away
he
sat
with
his
imposing
figure
bowed
slightly
forward
with
his
hands
spread
on
his
knees
he
had
spoken
agreeably
but
his
voice
had
a
hard
ring
and
his
eyes
a
shifty
gleam
that
further
put
chick
on
his
guard
he
sat
down
as
directed
replying
respectfully
you
sir
answer
any
questions
you
good
said
murdock
tells
me
you
are
out
of
work
and
came
from
did
were
you
doing
there
worked
in
a
hardware
you
handy
with
tools
so
chick
nodded
wondering
how
the
situation
would
turn
have
worked
as
a
carpenter
at
times
though
i
never
learned
the
look
like
a
man
accustomed
to
hard
work
said
murdock
smiling
through
his
heavy
beard
done
my
share
sir
for
all
see
your
palms
they
will
tell
the
chick
hesitated
for
only
the
hundredth
part
of
a
second
he
now
knew
what
was
coming
that
the
rascal
suspected
he
was
gripping
a
weapon
in
his
side
pocket
of
which
he
aimed
to
make
him
let
go
chick
reasoned
on
the
instant
too
that
he
was
up
against
desperate
odds
that
his
best
move
would
be
to
yield
to
the
rascals
temporarily
biding
his
own
time
to
discover
their
entire
game
and
to
turn
the
tables
on
them
all
this
really
was
no
more
than
he
had
expected
and
designed
when
he
boldly
entered
the
place
in
spite
of
the
risks
involved
chick
hesitated
only
for
an
instant
therefore
and
then
extended
both
hands
and
displayed
his
palms
as
directed
as
quick
as
a
flash
bending
forward
from
the
table
on
which
he
was
seated
bart
bailey
clapped
the
muzzle
of
a
revolver
to
the
head
move
he
commanded
with
sudden
sharp
ferocity
them
there
or
be
a
dead
one
we
want
your
hands
where
we
can
see
chick
dropped
them
on
his
knees
and
drew
up
in
his
chair
without
so
much
as
a
glance
at
bailey
and
apparently
not
the
least
disturbed
by
his
weapon
he
gazed
at
murdock
and
asked
coolly
the
meaning
of
this
it
all
about
eyes
took
on
a
more
venomous
gleam
and
glitter
his
voice
a
more
threatening
ring
know
it
all
about
he
said
sternly
you
stir
foot
or
finger
get
all
that
finley
has
threatened
you
are
playing
a
tricky
game
and
a
dangerous
one
for
it
cuts
no
ice
with
us
we
know
you
carter
and
are
out
to
get
you
as
out
to
get
us
chick
coolly
removed
his
disguise
and
tossed
it
upon
the
table
being
the
case
murdock
sail
under
true
colors
he
said
curtly
may
as
well
murdock
rejoined
with
a
sneer
get
gay
carter
or
pay
the
price
keep
your
hands
on
your
be
alarmed
chick
retorted
not
inviting
a
bullet
by
opposing
you
do
what
you
intend
doing
so
snapped
murdock
mistake
you
made
carter
was
in
undertaking
to
oppose
us
you
now
find
yourself
neatly
not
as
neatly
as
you
imagine
said
chick
have
had
nothing
on
on
you
eh
what
i
have
voluntarily
handed
cried
bart
bailey
with
a
snarl
and
scowl
that
to
the
marines
made
a
monkey
of
you
carter
and
you
know
not
in
you
bailey
to
make
a
monkey
of
me
chick
replied
with
a
scornful
glance
at
him
you
who
were
monkeyed
last
night
when
i
picked
you
up
in
lexington
avenue
and
trailed
you
to
philadelphia
with
you
none
the
insignificant
said
murdock
checking
bailey
with
a
gesture
know
all
about
that
we
know
just
how
it
was
you
do
chick
coolly
allowed
was
aware
of
that
several
hours
of
what
you
knew
a
detective
had
trailed
this
rascal
to
knew
it
several
hours
ago
demanded
murdock
suspiciously
guess
snarled
bailey
derisively
rot
how
could
he
know
it
have
another
guess
murdock
added
chick
not
averse
to
mocking
and
mystifying
the
rascals
in
spite
of
the
risk
it
involved
assume
too
that
you
are
the
man
who
sent
him
the
sent
him
murdock
sharply
demanded
evidently
rendered
apprehensive
by
repeated
assertions
was
sent
in
a
code
heavy
brows
knit
like
frowning
battlements
over
his
threatening
eyes
he
drew
forward
in
his
chair
searching
face
more
intently
did
you
learn
of
that
he
cried
while
bart
bailey
looked
as
if
he
had
been
hit
with
a
club
have
methods
of
my
own
murdock
for
getting
such
information
chick
replied
obvious
reasons
however
i
do
not
reveal
them
to
how
could
you
interpret
a
code
message
even
if
you
saw
the
telegram
unless
murdock
turned
sharply
to
bart
bailey
that
code
book
been
out
of
your
hands
on
your
life
cried
bart
emphatically
is
all
a
bluff
got
you
on
a
string
he
know
half
of
what
he
i
questioned
chick
glancing
at
him
again
know
that
you
were
directed
to
look
out
for
me
bailey
and
to
lure
me
to
new
york
if
possible
and
to
a
place
designated
in
your
code
book
as
the
cobweb
this
of
course
is
the
murdock
uttered
an
oath
evidently
staggered
and
more
alarmed
by
what
he
had
learned
he
cried
harshly
turning
to
the
man
with
a
mallet
this
infernal
meddler
find
out
whether
an
infernal
mind
reader
or
has
a
copy
of
our
code
in
his
bolton
hastened
to
obey
chick
laughed
indifferently
and
murdock
fiercely
added
with
both
hands
clenched
in
front
of
the
taunting
detective
you
knew
all
that
carter
why
have
you
walked
into
this
trap
that
surprise
you
appears
reckless
not
to
say
did
it
then
in
order
to
get
a
line
on
the
identity
of
you
scamps
and
to
learn
just
how
you
are
playing
your
knavish
game
chick
bluntly
admitted
is
that
so
then
you
shall
learn
snapped
murdock
fiercely
will
cost
you
your
life
but
you
shall
learn
make
it
a
point
to
satisfy
your
foolhardy
curiosity
you
shall
learn
but
at
the
cost
of
your
we
make
a
beginning
then
said
chick
a
bit
sharply
both
sail
under
true
he
reached
up
quickly
while
speaking
and
seized
grizzled
beard
giving
it
a
violent
jerk
it
came
away
in
his
hand
as
chick
had
suspected
revealing
the
face
of
gaston
goulard
chapter
viii
caught
in
a
corner
patsy
garvan
was
hit
with
an
idea
of
course
when
he
started
in
hot
pursuit
of
the
man
in
gray
he
suddenly
suspected
having
seen
him
come
from
the
back
door
of
private
office
under
the
circumstances
already
described
that
this
grizzly
bearded
fellow
was
none
other
than
gaston
goulard
himself
patsy
realized
moreover
that
the
investigations
he
had
made
after
the
hurried
departure
might
prevent
his
overtaking
him
and
that
was
the
thought
uppermost
in
mind
when
he
plunged
down
the
rear
stairway
in
pursuit
of
him
he
brought
up
in
a
paved
court
back
of
the
vast
building
it
made
in
from
a
side
street
and
was
used
chiefly
for
the
receiving
and
shipping
of
merchandise
from
the
store
it
adjoined
the
broad
doors
of
the
two
great
basement
rooms
devoted
to
these
branches
of
the
vast
business
several
wagons
and
teamsters
then
were
in
the
court
but
there
was
no
sign
of
the
man
patsy
was
seeking
surely
came
this
way
he
hurriedly
reasoned
must
have
gone
to
the
side
street
too
for
the
other
end
of
the
court
brings
up
against
a
wing
of
the
building
take
that
patsy
took
it
vainly
however
darting
in
that
direction
he
could
not
discover
his
quarry
in
the
side
street
in
spite
of
his
hurried
scrutiny
it
then
became
a
question
as
to
which
direction
the
man
had
taken
would
have
gone
through
the
store
of
course
if
heading
for
sixth
avenue
patsy
continued
to
reason
would
have
been
the
nearest
way
and
he
appeared
to
be
in
a
hurry
odds
then
that
he
went
the
other
way
and
that
way
for
patsy
started
off
again
and
walked
for
nearly
a
block
gazing
sharply
in
every
store
including
that
of
the
acme
novelty
company
but
he
finally
was
forced
to
admit
to
himself
that
he
had
lost
his
man
whiz
tough
luck
he
muttered
pausing
and
then
turning
back
eat
my
hat
crown
and
brim
if
that
goulard
himself
why
the
dickens
i
hook
onto
that
idea
on
the
jump
i
then
could
have
trailed
him
without
sweating
a
hair
nothing
for
me
now
but
to
return
and
tell
the
chief
when
he
shows
up
in
the
slowly
retracing
his
steps
however
patsy
lingered
for
several
moments
here
and
there
still
hoping
to
discover
his
quarry
a
taxicab
was
approaching
from
sixth
avenue
it
stopped
suddenly
at
a
store
on
the
same
side
as
patsy
and
some
thirty
feet
from
where
he
then
was
standing
a
man
sprang
out
quickly
followed
by
another
and
patsy
then
felt
a
thrill
shoot
up
his
spine
smoke
chick
in
disguise
as
sure
as
to
a
grasshopper
he
said
to
himself
while
he
watched
both
men
hurry
into
the
store
know
that
disguise
as
well
as
i
know
his
own
face
patsy
went
on
mentally
was
on
bart
track
and
it
now
is
a
hundred
to
one
that
he
has
some
job
on
the
rascal
the
other
must
be
bailey
himself
great
guns
getting
wiser
every
minute
now
a
thousand
to
one
that
goulard
went
into
that
store
or
why
has
bailey
gone
in
there
gee
the
boot
may
be
on
the
other
leg
this
may
be
a
job
to
get
the
best
of
chick
that
may
be
hurried
mission
from
the
department
patsy
had
reasoned
it
out
correctly
in
spite
of
his
meager
information
of
the
actual
circumstances
bart
bailey
had
as
a
matter
of
fact
sent
goulard
a
message
in
response
to
the
code
telegram
and
had
informed
him
of
his
designs
patsy
was
not
slow
in
acting
upon
his
suspicion
nevertheless
though
he
took
care
not
to
interfere
with
whatever
chick
might
have
up
his
sleeve
he
sauntered
by
the
store
glancing
up
at
the
sign
and
through
the
window
he
passed
just
in
time
to
see
nolan
turn
back
after
locking
the
door
and
then
vanish
with
chick
down
the
rear
stairway
look
good
to
me
thought
patsy
brows
knitting
did
he
lock
that
door
chick
evidently
knew
it
and
stood
for
it
he
must
know
what
doing
therefore
but
he
may
slip
a
cog
in
some
way
not
butt
in
but
be
hanged
if
i
do
a
bit
of
nosing
around
on
my
own
patsy
sauntered
by
the
store
again
and
now
saw
plainly
that
it
was
unoccupied
he
then
moved
on
and
crossed
the
street
to
survey
the
two
upper
floors
one
lives
up
there
he
muttered
may
be
the
gink
i
saw
in
the
store
or
some
one
else
employed
there
not
risk
asking
any
questions
gee
i
might
get
next
in
that
patsy
was
hit
with
another
idea
he
had
discovered
an
open
alley
leading
to
the
rear
of
the
building
he
also
had
discovered
a
stonemason
at
work
in
the
alley
engaged
in
pointing
up
portions
of
the
brick
wall
of
the
next
building
he
was
at
work
with
a
bucket
of
mortar
and
a
trowel
patsy
made
a
short
detour
and
presently
paused
at
the
entrance
to
the
alley
he
called
quietly
the
mason
turned
quickly
a
ruddy
young
irishman
and
patsy
signed
for
him
to
come
out
and
follow
him
they
met
a
few
rods
away
a
moment
later
out
of
view
from
the
windows
above
the
suspected
store
want
questioned
the
irishman
curiously
into
the
saloon
here
and
tell
you
said
patsy
also
buy
you
a
drink
or
whatever
you
and
i
can
stand
that
all
right
grinned
the
irishman
patsy
led
the
way
to
a
rear
room
of
the
saloon
where
he
gave
a
waiter
an
order
and
he
then
proceeded
to
explain
his
project
to
his
companion
revealing
his
identity
and
his
relations
with
nick
carter
wish
to
size
up
that
building
next
to
the
one
on
which
you
are
working
grady
he
said
having
learned
the
name
must
do
so
without
being
suspected
i
can
get
by
all
right
if
lend
me
your
duck
blouse
overalls
and
hat
and
remain
here
under
cover
while
i
get
in
my
grady
grinned
other
words
garvan
you
want
to
take
my
place
said
he
slip
you
a
note
for
it
grady
and
kape
the
five
bucks
in
your
pocket
garvan
grady
warmly
interrupted
who
do
that
much
for
nick
carter
if
you
get
into
these
togs
as
quick
as
i
come
out
of
them
you
can
be
at
work
with
me
trowel
in
the
shake
of
a
tail
hide
here
with
my
trap
closed
be
it
long
or
short
that
gone
that
goes
too
by
these
five
fingers
all
right
grady
from
your
toes
up
replied
patsy
gratefully
it
from
me
all
the
same
get
yours
for
patsy
sauntered
out
of
the
saloon
in
about
five
minutes
only
a
close
observer
would
have
detected
his
subterfuge
one
who
had
seen
grady
at
work
would
merely
have
supposed
that
another
mason
had
taken
his
place
patsy
devoted
very
little
time
of
course
to
pointing
up
the
brick
wall
he
began
instead
while
pretending
to
be
at
work
a
furtive
inspection
of
the
walls
adjoining
the
basement
to
which
he
had
seen
chick
and
nolan
descend
he
could
find
however
no
window
lighting
the
underground
room
mighty
strange
he
said
to
himself
they
been
stoned
up
for
some
reason
be
hanged
if
i
think
this
crib
figures
in
some
way
in
the
robberies
i
reckon
go
a
step
patsy
already
had
found
that
a
rear
door
and
stairway
led
up
to
the
dwelling
over
the
store
of
the
acme
novelty
company
he
could
observe
no
one
at
any
of
the
windows
however
and
he
felt
quite
sure
that
he
could
stealthily
enter
the
place
seen
by
any
one
i
can
say
i
came
in
to
ask
for
some
water
for
my
mortar
he
said
to
himself
take
the
mounting
the
two
low
steps
outside
patsy
found
that
the
door
was
locked
also
that
the
key
had
been
removed
simplifies
it
he
muttered
can
pick
this
lock
like
breaking
he
accomplished
it
with
a
picklock
in
half
a
minute
quietly
opening
the
door
a
few
inches
he
gazed
into
a
narrow
hall
and
at
a
bare
stairway
leading
upward
a
door
in
the
right
wall
some
ten
feet
away
also
met
his
gaze
he
paused
briefly
and
listened
not
a
sound
came
from
within
the
hall
was
as
silent
as
if
the
building
was
deserted
patsy
stepped
in
and
closed
the
door
leaving
it
unlocked
lest
he
might
have
occasion
to
retreat
hurriedly
the
closing
of
the
door
left
the
hall
and
stairway
in
darkness
barring
a
single
thread
of
artificial
light
that
now
caught
his
eye
it
was
a
vertical
thread
in
the
side
wall
some
two
feet
from
where
he
was
standing
light
thought
patsy
listening
again
store
is
not
lighted
nor
does
the
store
run
back
as
far
as
this
the
door
leading
into
the
store
from
this
hall
is
farther
in
there
must
be
a
lighted
room
back
here
all
the
same
or
this
chink
by
gracious
a
panel
thrusting
his
nails
into
the
crevice
through
which
the
light
had
shone
patsy
had
felt
a
section
of
the
wall
slip
noiselessly
to
one
side
revealing
a
secret
panel
so
skillfully
constructed
as
to
defy
ordinary
inspection
it
revealed
moreover
something
of
far
greater
significance
a
flight
of
steps
led
down
to
a
brightly
lighted
basement
in
the
extreme
rear
of
the
building
it
was
walled
in
like
a
tomb
however
with
no
sign
of
a
window
on
the
cement
floor
stood
a
large
horizontal
engine
of
peculiar
construction
so
peculiar
that
patsy
could
not
imagine
for
what
it
was
used
or
why
it
was
there
near
by
on
a
rack
was
a
metal
cylinder
about
two
feet
long
and
ten
inches
in
diameter
each
end
had
a
movable
metal
cover
around
both
ends
moreover
was
a
flange
of
thick
felt
on
a
narrow
table
near
the
farther
wall
one
of
them
spread
open
evidently
for
inspection
and
so
placed
that
its
folds
hung
nearly
to
the
floor
lay
two
costly
persian
shawls
the
instant
gaze
fell
upon
them
the
truth
began
to
dawn
upon
him
guns
he
exclaimed
mentally
two
shawls
mentioned
by
goulard
he
did
not
bring
them
here
however
there
is
a
connection
between
this
cellar
and
the
department
store
a
dead
cinch
and
operated
in
some
way
with
this
engine
by
gracious
have
a
closer
look
if
it
takes
a
leg
patsy
had
seen
of
course
that
this
subterranean
chamber
then
was
deserted
placing
the
panel
exactly
as
he
had
found
it
patsy
crept
down
the
steps
and
gazed
around
have
it
he
muttered
interior
wall
has
been
built
across
the
original
basement
so
as
to
form
this
chamber
and
at
the
same
time
prevent
detection
by
persons
in
the
other
part
of
the
basement
who
would
naturally
suppose
it
extended
back
no
farther
than
this
inner
wall
it
must
be
to
the
other
part
of
the
basement
that
chick
descended
he
still
must
be
there
too
unless
that
there
was
no
alternative
that
his
suspicions
from
the
outset
had
been
correct
that
he
had
trapped
himself
also
and
was
up
against
a
sudden
desperate
situation
all
flashed
over
patsy
on
the
instant
when
his
train
of
thought
was
broken
by
sounds
that
sent
a
momentary
chill
down
his
spine
the
quick
opening
of
a
door
the
heavy
tread
of
feet
mingled
with
a
harsh
commanding
voice
which
he
instantly
recognized
to
be
that
of
gaston
goulard
these
were
the
sounds
that
suddenly
fell
upon
ears
that
panel
door
bolton
and
give
us
more
light
goulard
was
crying
him
up
here
nelson
and
be
quick
about
it
lend
him
a
hand
bart
hide
the
infernal
dick
in
the
engine
room
till
we
can
dispose
of
him
work
lively
i
must
phone
to
lombard
and
make
sure
that
all
is
well
before
i
scott
thought
patsy
before
half
of
the
foregoing
was
said
in
wrong
all
right
against
odds
which
hang
it
my
best
patsy
had
caught
sight
of
the
persian
shawl
hanging
over
the
side
of
the
table
as
quick
as
a
flash
dropping
to
the
floor
he
rolled
under
the
table
and
back
of
the
folds
of
the
shawl
which
for
a
moment
at
least
served
to
shelter
him
like
a
curtain
he
scarce
had
accomplished
this
and
checked
the
slight
disturbance
of
the
hanging
shawl
when
the
panel
flew
open
and
nolan
and
bart
bailey
roughly
rolled
chick
carter
then
bound
hand
and
foot
down
the
flight
of
steps
to
the
floor
there
blast
you
until
ready
to
hand
you
something
more
bailey
cried
with
a
snarl
with
our
business
will
you
send
you
to
the
devil
for
him
there
snapped
goulard
sharply
him
there
and
close
the
door
wait
here
you
three
while
i
phone
to
lombard
no
telling
what
these
carters
may
have
done
or
will
do
find
out
in
a
couple
of
patsy
heard
his
strident
voice
even
after
the
panel
door
was
closed
he
also
heard
him
rush
through
the
hall
evidently
to
a
telephone
in
the
rear
part
of
the
store
patsy
did
not
wait
to
hear
more
he
whipped
out
his
knife
and
rolled
from
under
the
table
giving
chick
who
was
only
a
bit
bruised
by
his
fall
down
the
steps
the
surprise
of
his
life
you
here
patsy
said
he
quietly
you
muttered
patsy
quickly
cutting
bands
a
charley
on
the
spot
for
there
a
way
out
up
these
box
old
top
eh
declared
patsy
undaunted
we
have
been
in
just
as
tight
and
then
some
chick
nodded
springing
up
you
got
two
guns
me
have
one
the
rats
have
taken
sooner
said
than
done
grinned
patsy
handing
chick
one
of
his
revolvers
and
retaining
the
other
next
shall
we
make
a
break
at
once
and
nail
them
in
their
own
trenches
or
chick
interrupted
the
switch
key
that
cuts
off
these
lights
the
rascals
will
fight
back
but
they
could
not
get
a
line
on
us
in
the
dark
we
can
get
them
at
that
wise
said
patsy
vainly
searching
for
the
electric
switch
key
quick
whispered
chick
crouching
at
the
foot
of
the
steps
ah
something
doing
something
is
a
roar
from
gaston
goulard
had
reached
his
ears
a
fierce
oath
followed
by
the
deuce
to
pay
i
get
lombard
on
the
phone
he
has
been
arrested
a
chance
by
thunder
that
guns
will
show
up
here
at
any
moment
gag
that
infernal
dick
in
the
engine
room
then
put
out
the
light
fix
already
fixed
bart
bailey
had
thrown
open
the
panel
door
and
suddenly
discovered
the
two
detectives
up
chick
shouted
starting
up
the
steps
with
them
or
up
be
hanged
bart
bailey
leaped
aside
seeking
the
shelter
of
the
wall
then
whipped
out
a
revolver
and
fired
through
the
doorway
the
bullet
whizzed
a
foot
over
head
with
the
lights
patsy
he
shouted
the
bulbs
revolver
swung
upward
like
a
flash
there
was
a
crash
of
breaking
glass
and
the
subterranean
chamber
was
in
darkness
chapter
ix
by
the
air
line
nick
carter
arrived
early
that
afternoon
in
the
big
department
store
of
mantell
goulard
and
several
circumstances
determined
as
he
had
predicted
to
patsy
that
morning
the
course
he
afterward
shaped
one
was
the
fact
that
for
the
reasons
already
presented
he
had
received
no
communication
from
chick
and
knew
nothing
about
his
movements
another
was
the
fact
that
he
could
find
no
sign
of
patsy
garvan
in
any
part
of
the
great
store
a
third
was
the
fact
that
gaston
goulard
was
absent
from
his
office
and
that
his
whereabouts
was
unknown
as
nick
learned
upon
talking
with
frank
mantell
and
his
father
which
he
then
had
decided
to
do
and
both
of
whom
he
found
in
the
private
office
of
the
senior
partner
nick
then
learned
too
of
the
theft
that
had
been
committed
in
the
receiving
room
that
morning
about
which
goulard
had
expressed
himself
so
forcibly
after
apparently
vainly
investigating
it
nick
smiled
a
bit
grimly
after
gathering
these
several
points
and
now
suspicions
began
to
arise
in
his
mind
there
been
previous
thefts
from
the
receiving
room
mantell
he
inquired
addressing
the
elder
many
of
them
very
many
was
the
reply
has
charge
in
that
room
man
named
george
feel
absolutely
sure
of
it
he
has
been
in
my
employ
for
a
long
evidently
is
being
duped
in
some
way
then
said
nick
looks
after
the
opening
of
all
packages
that
are
received
i
suppose
and
sees
that
their
contents
are
sent
up
to
the
of
course
with
the
occasional
help
of
goulard
or
were
both
in
the
receiving
room
this
morning
i
think
you
have
were
carter
bowed
mantell
went
down
to
investigate
the
either
of
them
there
before
the
theft
was
discovered
lombard
went
down
to
check
off
an
invoice
of
the
package
from
which
the
two
shawls
are
see
nick
remarked
think
i
will
go
down
there
frank
and
look
around
a
bit
show
me
the
way
as
far
as
the
stairs
then
leave
me
and
pay
no
attention
to
my
doings
i
may
have
something
to
report
a
little
frank
mantell
arose
to
obey
and
nick
accompanied
him
down
to
the
ground
floor
as
they
were
turning
toward
the
stairway
leading
down
to
the
basement
receiving
room
frank
touched
the
arm
and
said
quietly
goes
lombard
now
i
think
he
is
going
down
to
the
receiving
lombard
was
heading
for
the
stairs
with
a
wrapped
bundle
about
a
foot
long
and
nearly
as
large
in
diameter
but
he
did
not
see
mantell
and
his
companion
nick
watched
him
for
a
moment
then
said
quietly
me
mantell
i
can
find
the
way
by
following
nick
had
more
than
one
object
in
doing
so
he
arrived
at
the
head
of
the
stairs
just
as
lombard
turned
to
the
left
in
the
great
basement
room
nick
darted
down
after
him
and
again
fortune
favored
him
he
reached
the
entrance
to
the
room
which
was
always
partly
filled
with
unopened
packages
of
divers
descriptions
just
in
time
to
see
lombard
glide
stealthily
back
of
a
high
pile
of
cases
about
two
feet
from
one
of
the
walls
nick
saw
an
empty
case
about
ten
feet
to
the
right
of
the
door
he
crouched
behind
it
and
waited
less
than
two
minutes
had
passed
when
lombard
returned
without
the
bundle
he
quickly
reached
the
stairway
and
hurried
up
to
the
business
part
of
the
store
nick
eyes
had
a
sharper
gleam
when
he
crept
from
his
concealment
he
at
once
gave
his
attention
to
the
narrow
passage
in
which
lombard
must
have
left
the
bundle
one
side
was
formed
by
the
high
pile
of
cases
on
the
other
was
a
sheathed
wall
nick
examined
the
cases
in
rapid
succession
and
he
soon
found
that
none
of
them
could
be
opened
obviously
none
could
be
a
hiding
place
for
the
bundle
nick
then
began
a
careful
inspection
of
the
wall
sounding
it
foot
by
foot
by
tapping
it
with
his
knuckles
he
suspected
of
course
that
there
might
be
a
secret
panel
with
an
open
space
behind
it
presently
he
found
a
spot
that
sounded
more
hollow
than
other
sections
jove
i
think
right
he
muttered
there
seems
to
be
no
crack
or
crevice
the
panel
if
there
is
one
is
most
cleverly
persistently
searching
the
wall
however
nick
finally
discovered
the
head
of
a
nail
some
six
feet
above
the
floor
it
did
not
appear
to
be
as
dusty
as
the
rest
of
the
wall
he
reached
up
and
pressed
it
with
his
thumb
this
instantly
brought
a
faint
click
from
behind
the
sheathing
a
section
of
it
about
two
feet
square
so
neatly
fitted
that
the
cracks
were
invisible
separated
from
the
rest
and
swung
outward
under
the
impulse
of
a
hidden
spring
it
brought
to
light
the
foundation
wall
of
the
building
also
a
circular
metal
plate
about
fourteen
inches
in
diameter
with
a
handle
by
which
it
could
be
swung
downward
parallel
with
the
face
of
the
wall
nick
forced
it
down
and
discovered
the
opening
of
a
tube
through
the
wall
and
in
the
tube
a
cylinder
such
as
patsy
had
seen
in
the
subterranean
chamber
nick
instantly
hit
upon
the
truth
of
course
and
the
mystery
as
to
how
the
merchandise
had
been
taken
from
the
store
ended
then
and
there
pneumatic
tube
he
said
to
himself
noting
the
flange
of
felt
around
the
end
of
the
cylinder
to
those
of
a
cash
system
the
tube
evidently
runs
underground
to
another
building
where
there
must
be
an
engine
and
air
pump
for
removing
the
air
from
the
tube
that
done
and
this
plate
lowered
the
cylinder
would
fly
through
the
tube
in
an
nick
carefully
noted
the
probable
direction
of
the
tube
then
turned
a
knob
in
the
metal
end
of
the
cylinder
from
which
he
took
as
he
expected
the
bundle
seen
under
arm
only
ten
minutes
before
nick
closed
the
tube
and
panel
then
took
the
bundle
up
to
private
office
where
he
found
both
father
and
son
gracious
nick
there
has
been
another
theft
frank
mantell
cried
when
the
detective
entered
pair
of
costly
lace
curtains
is
missing
from
that
nick
did
not
care
for
any
particulars
he
sat
down
in
one
of
the
large
leather
chairs
and
placed
the
bundle
on
the
floor
behind
it
too
bad
mantell
he
remarked
would
like
to
question
one
of
your
managers
send
for
lombard
since
we
happened
to
notice
him
a
few
minutes
frank
mantell
looked
surprised
but
hastened
to
obey
lombard
entered
in
about
five
minutes
apparently
apprehending
nothing
nick
had
removed
his
disguise
and
thrust
it
into
his
pocket
down
lombard
said
he
without
waiting
to
be
introduced
am
told
there
has
just
been
another
mysterious
theft
in
this
so
i
have
heard
was
the
quick
reply
was
just
going
to
look
into
the
you
think
it
would
be
more
profitable
to
look
into
that
pneumatic
tube
that
leads
out
of
the
receiving
room
nick
inquired
lombard
turned
as
white
as
his
shirt
front
know
what
you
mean
he
faltered
what
tube
in
which
i
found
this
bundle
a
few
minutes
ago
said
nick
taking
it
from
behind
his
chair
and
tearing
it
open
are
the
stolen
lace
curtains
i
refer
to
the
tube
lombard
in
which
you
placed
lombard
started
to
rise
but
his
knees
gave
way
under
him
and
he
nearly
fainted
in
his
chair
while
mantell
and
his
father
stared
in
speechless
amazement
nick
leaned
forward
and
before
lombard
fairly
knew
it
snapped
a
pair
of
handcuffs
on
the
wrists
said
he
more
sternly
me
where
that
tube
leads
lombard
and
be
quick
about
it
the
jig
is
up
for
you
and
your
lombard
pulled
himself
together
and
glared
at
nick
with
a
scowl
learn
nothing
from
me
he
growled
bitterly
out
for
yourself
if
you
want
to
precisely
what
i
will
do
declared
nick
starting
up
after
this
man
mantell
till
i
return
i
have
a
hunch
that
i
shall
not
return
nick
did
not
wait
for
a
reply
but
seized
his
hat
and
hurried
from
the
office
he
had
noted
the
probable
direction
of
the
underground
tube
and
he
hastened
through
the
corridor
and
down
the
same
back
stairway
over
which
patsy
had
pursued
gaston
goulard
he
ejaculated
upon
arriving
in
the
court
runs
under
these
pavements
and
into
the
basement
of
this
next
building
find
out
who
occupies
nick
hurried
out
to
the
side
street
and
gazed
up
at
the
sign
novelty
indeed
thought
nick
trying
the
door
and
finding
it
locked
one
at
home
eh
slip
around
and
try
the
back
he
had
arrived
nearly
at
the
entrance
to
the
alley
when
he
caught
sight
of
a
policeman
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
street
he
whistled
and
beckoned
him
over
with
me
doyle
and
have
your
gun
within
easy
reach
he
said
quietly
up
carter
questioned
doyle
at
once
recognizing
the
detective
nick
nodded
know
yet
however
how
big
game
we
may
i
care
how
big
me
through
the
alley
then
and
nick
stopped
for
an
instant
only
there
had
reached
his
ear
a
sound
though
a
bit
muffled
which
he
instantly
recognized
the
sharp
spiteful
crack
of
a
revolver
on
doyle
he
snapped
quickly
smacks
of
big
game
all
right
i
reckon
in
the
nick
of
nick
was
running
at
top
speed
through
the
alley
while
speaking
with
the
burly
policeman
close
on
his
heels
ten
seconds
brought
them
to
the
back
door
of
the
building
which
patsy
garvan
had
left
unlocked
nick
then
heard
the
shouts
of
men
within
and
the
furious
voice
of
gaston
goulard
got
them
doyle
he
said
quietly
pausing
for
an
instant
you
ready
go
ahead
if
you
say
the
much
nick
turned
the
knob
and
threw
open
the
door
shedding
the
bright
daylight
into
the
dim
hall
in
which
goulard
bart
bailey
nolan
and
bolton
were
attempting
with
fierce
threats
to
subdue
chick
and
patsy
who
had
smashed
the
lamps
in
the
subterranean
chamber
only
a
moment
before
nick
broke
in
upon
them
with
his
revolver
ready
shouting
sternly
it
you
fellows
hands
up
and
his
voice
was
drowned
by
the
crack
of
a
revolver
in
the
hand
of
the
only
man
who
ventured
any
resistance
that
of
bart
bailey
the
rascal
had
crouched
quickly
back
of
goulard
and
had
escaped
immediate
notice
the
bullet
tore
a
hole
in
the
sleeve
and

the
details
of
the
crime
as
they
afterward
appeared
were
very
nearly
in
line
with
which
nick
carter
had
been
led
to
suspect
it
was
learned
later
that
goulard
long
had
been
hopelessly
under
water
financially
having
vast
secret
commitments
in
the
stock
market
and
he
confessed
to
having
taken
this
method
to
rob
his
partner
and
repair
his
wasted
fortune
he
had
gone
far
enough
to
nearly
wreck
the
business
as
a
matter
of
fact
and
the
firm
went
out
of
existence

shortly
before
the

of
the

while

in

nick

made
several

proved
for
the
most
part
to
be
correct
rascal

observed
speaking
of
gaston
goulard
the
mark
of
cain
he
has
begun
with
being
a
traitor
to
his
own

he
probably
will
do
time
for
the
crime
and
then
he
will
continue
the
downward
path
odds
that
he
will
commit
murder
sooner
or
later

the

chapter
iv
a
warning
the
more
owen
thought
over
his
interview
with
boss
coggswell
the
more
convinced
he
became
that
the
sole
reason
the
politician
had
sent
for
him
had
been
to
try
to
bribe
him
to
hold
out
the
mail
of
a
certain
person
on
his
route
that
coggswell
had
summoned
him
to
the
club
in
order
to
express
his
admiration
of
independence
in
refusing
to
buy
the
ticket
to
the
outing
seemed
absurd
it
had
sounded
almost
plausible
when
the
boss
had
said
it
in
his
smooth
convincing
voice
but
when
he
came
to
think
over
it
afterward
owen
could
see
how
preposterous
the
thing
was
imagine
any
political
leader
going
into
raptures
over
a
young
man
who
had
called
him
a
blackmailer
imagine
him
being
anxious
to
help
a
young
man
to
promotion
just
because
he
liked
his
way
of
talking
said
the
carrier
to
himself
offer
of
a
postal
job
was
made
to
tempt
me
to
do
crooked
work
and
now
that
refused
wager
that
he
move
a
finger
to
help
me
but
i
care
about
that
he
added
confidently
get
there
all
right
without
his
something
happened
the
following
morning
which
greatly
strengthened
the
suspicions
of
the
carrier
and
made
him
certain
that
boss
coggswell
had
sinister
designs
upon
the
mail
of
some
person
on
his
route
when
he
reported
for
work
owen
was
informed
by
henderson
the
superintendent
of
branch
x
y
that
beginning
that
morning
he
was
to
cover
a
new
territory
instead
of
route
he
would
henceforth
and
until
further
notice
cover
route
sixteen
now
in
work
it
is
a
great
advantage
naturally
to
have
the
carriers
familiar
with
the
territory
which
they
have
to
cover
it
stands
to
reason
that
a
postman
can
not
make
as
quick
deliveries
over
strange
ground
as
on
a
route
in
which
he
knows
the
names
in
the
house
letter
boxes
almost
by
heart
for
this
reason
the
men
are
not
changed
around
any
more
than
can
be
avoided
therefore
owen
knew
as
soon
as
henderson
told
him
that
his
route
was
to
be
changed
that
this
must
be
due
to
influence
the
politician
wanted
to
get
him
out
of
the
way
and
have
him
replaced
by
a
man
who
would
not
refuse
to
do
his
bidding
owen
inquired
who
was
to
succeed
him
on
route
and
learned
that
it
was
a
carrier
named
greene
a
man
whom
owen
liked
less
than
any
other
employee
of
branch
x
greene
who
was
a
fellow
was
a
member
of
the
samuel
coggswell
association
owen
learned
and
on
friendly
terms
with
jake
hines
the
fact
that
he
had
been
selected
for
route
certainly
looked
significant
to
be
taken
away
from
his
old
territory
was
a
great
blow
to
owen
for
be
it
remembered
the
office
of
walter
sammis
was
located
in
that
section
and
his
transfer
meant
that
he
no
longer
would
be
able
to
exchange
a
few
words
each
morning
with
dallas
worthington
and
besides
this
the
new
route
was
a
much
less
pleasant
one
carrier
greene
who
had
covered
it
for
two
years
had
certain
reasons
of
his
own
for
being
satisfied
with
it
but
owen
found
the
new
territory
very
disagreeable
it
comprised
the
very
poorest
and
most
squalid
section
of
the
district
the
inhabitants
were
mostly
foreigners
and
the
handwriting
on
letters
they
received
was
hard
to
decipher
they
were
in
the
habit
of
changing
their
addresses
frequently
too
and
this
entailed
extra
clerical
work
for
each
carrier
has
to
enter
all
such
removals
in
his
then
again
many
of
the
tenants
of
the
tenements
were
too
shiftless
or
ignorant
to
post
their
names
in
the
vestibules
and
this
made
deliveries
very
difficult
and
consumed
a
lot
of
time
nevertheless
owen
did
not
make
any
protest
he
accepted
the
situation
philosophically
and
started
out
to
cover
his
new
route
as
cheerfully
as
if
he
really
relished
the
change
but
inwardly
he
registered
a
vow
that
he
was
going
to
find
out
the
identity
of
the
person
whose
mail
boss
coggswell
wanted
to
get
hold
of
and
check
that
sinister
plans
first
he
went
to
the
three
carriers
responsible
for
route
for
every
route
is
covered
by
three
men
and
warned
them
of
what
he
purposed
to
do
the
two
other
carriers
who
took
turns
at
covering
that
territory
were
named
gordon
and
smithers
they
had
both
had
route
for
several
years
the
fact
that
they
were
not
now
taken
off
gave
owen
reason
to
suppose
that
they
must
be
satisfactory
to
boss
coggswell
and
willing
to
do
his
dirty
work
for
he
reasoned
that
in
order
to
carry
out
his
crooked
scheme
the
politician
must
have
the
coöperation
of
all
three
carriers
who
covered
that
route
otherwise
the
particular
letters
which
coggswell
wanted
to
get
hold
of
might
go
through
when
greene
was
not
on
duty
owen
was
on
friendly
terms
with
both
gordon
and
smithers
in
fact
the
latter
and
he
roomed
in
the
same
boarding
house
the
former
was
a
pleasant
sort
of
fellow
but
of
a
weak
character
he
was
always
heavily
in
debt
and
he
was
a
hard
drinker
more
than
once
he
had
been
caught
under
the
influence
of
liquor
while
on
duty
and
these
lapses
would
have
resulted
in
his
dismissal
from
the
department
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
intercession
of
samuel
coggswell
who
was
a
friend
of
his
father
smithers
like
greene
was
a
member
of
the
samuel
coggswell
association
and
a
crony
of
jake
hines
he
was
a
tall
young
man
of
about
age
taciturn
and
very
shrewd
owen
felt
sure
that
these
men
were
all
in
the
plot
to
tamper
with
the
mails
as
he
want
to
see
them
disgraced
and
sent
to
prison
he
decided
to
give
them
due
warning
of
course
they
indignantly
denied
that
any
such
proposition
had
been
made
to
them
by
boss
coggswell
or
that
they
knew
anything
about
a
scheme
to
hold
up
mail
on
route
smithers
told
owen
that
he
must
be
raving
mad
to
suspect
anything
like
that
gordon
laughed
and
declared
that
it
was
the
best
joke
he
had
heard
in
many
a
day
greene
growled
that
owen
was
sore
at
having
been
transferred
and
was
trying
to
besmirch
his
character
in
order
to
get
square
well
retorted
owen
grimly
given
you
fellows
notice
now
if
you
go
ahead
and
get
caught
got
only
yourselves
to
blame
i
know
that
there
is
such
a
crooked
scheme
afoot
and
going
to
find
out
the
name
of
the
victim
and
put
him
on
his
chapter
a
strong
lead
owen
began
by
watching
carrier
greene
as
he
stood
at
his
case
sorting
out
the
mail
preparatory
to
starting
out
on
the
first
delivery
he
thought
he
might
be
able
to
see
him
withdraw
and
pocket
the
desired
letters
and
thereby
get
an
important
clew
but
greene
made
no
such
compromising
move
owen
maintained
the
same
close
watch
when
gordon
and
smithers
were
at
the
sorting
cases
but
these
vigils
were
not
productive
of
results
either
the
letters
which
coggswell
wanted
had
not
yet
shown
up
or
the
three
carriers
were
too
cautious
to
abstract
them
in
the
post
office
preferring
to
wait
until
they
had
them
in
the
bags
and
were
out
on
the
street
where
they
could
get
at
them
without
being
observed
it
was
a
headline
on
the
front
page
of
a
morning
newspaper
which
at
length
set
owen
on
the
right
track
this
headline
read
lawrence
to
fight
former
judge
preparing
to
wrest
district
leadership
from
boss
at
coming
primaries
coggswell
said
to
be
seriously
alarmed
by
plan
to
dethrone
now
part
of
postal
route
was
a
row
of
brownstone
private
residences
and
in
one
of
these
lived
the
honorable
sugden
lawrence
former
judge
and
now
a
lawyer
of
considerable
prominence
owen
decided
that
this
was
the
man
whose
mail
boss
coggswell
wished
to
intercept
in
the
first
place
if
as
the
newspaper
stated
judge
lawrence
was
threatening
to
wrest
the
district
leadership
from
its
present
incumbent
was
it
not
exceedingly
likely
that
the
latter
would
be
anxious
to
something
his
prospective
opponent
some
scandal
which
could
be
used
to
crush
the
enemy
with
such
an
object
in
view
secret
access
to
a
private
correspondence
would
be
a
valuable
factor
many
a
family
skeleton
has
been
revealed
by
this
means
many
a
public
career
has
been
ruined
by
means
of
a
purloined
letter
in
the
second
place
and
this
was
in
his
opinion
the
strongest
argument
in
favor
of
his
theory
owen
happened
to
know
that
henderson
the
superintendent
of
branch
x
y
had
a
brother
who
was
a
clerk
in
judge
office
owen
had
wondered
until
now
why
boss
coggswell
in
his
desire
to
tamper
with
mail
had
not
gone
direct
to
henderson
and
had
the
thing
done
right
in
the
post
office
before
the
mail
was
handed
to
the
carriers
surely
this
would
have
been
easier
and
much
more
safe
than
to
deal
with
three
subordinates
several
little
incidents
which
had
come
under
his
observation
gave
owen
reason
to
believe
that
the
superintendent
of
branch
x
y
was
not
an
overscrupulous
official
he
was
a
man
who
in
the
administration
of
his
office
to
an
outrageous
extent
under
ordinary
circumstances
no
doubt
he
would
not
have
hesitated
to
do
boss
coggswell
this
favor
why
then
had
not
the
politician
gone
to
henderson
instead
of
dealing
with
the
carriers
owen
believed
that
he
understood
why
now
coggswell
was
afraid
that
the
superintendent
would
not
stand
for
any
monkeying
with
the
mail
of
his
employer
he
might
have
warned
the
judge
and
caused
trouble
convinced
that
his
theory
was
correct
owen
went
that
evening
to
the
residence
of
lawrence
the
latter
a
keen
aggressive
man
a
few
years
past
middle
age
received
the
letter
carrier
in
his
library
and
listened
with
great
attention
to
what
he
had
to
say
when
owen
was
through
judge
lawrence
nodded
his
head
vigorously
think
you
have
guessed
right
he
said
fact
i
a
bit
of
doubt
that
it
is
my
mail
which
that
rascal
coggswell
is
after
there
is
a
certain
incident
he
went
on
which
i
am
now
in
correspondence
with
a
certain
person
while
there
is
really
nothing
about
this
incident
nothing
which
could
bring
discredit
on
me
if
the
real
facts
were
known
the
matter
could
be
misrepresented
in
a
manner
which
would
greatly
injure
my
reputation
i
happen
to
know
that
coggswell
has
a
slight
inkling
of
this
matter
already
and
has
been
trying
for
some
time
past
to
get
more
information
on
the
subject
so
that
he
can
spring
it
on
me
and
smash
me
at
the
primaries
that
is
why
i
feel
pretty
sure
that
it
is
my
mail
he
is
scheming
to
get
hold
he
banged
his
fist
vigorously
upon
the
library
table
with
uncle
mail
is
a
pretty
serious
offense
he
declared
grimly
so
friend
coggswell
will
learn
if
he
is
engaged
in
such
a
contemptible
piece
of
he
arose
and
held
out
his
hand
to
owen
am
very
grateful
to
you
for
having
come
to
me
and
put
me
on
my
guard
sheridan
he
said
am
going
to
take
steps
immediately
to
ascertain
if
our
suspicions
are
correct
and
if
they
are
you
and
i
are
going
to
put
samuel
coggswell
in
prison
chapter
vi
jack
hines
in
love
miss
is
the
main
squeeze
in
at
this
unconventional
salutation
dallas
worthington
looked
up
from
her
typewriter
and
stared
curiously
at
the
person
who
had
given
utterance
to
it
she
saw
that
the
visitor
was
a
stout
young
man
who
wore
a
suit
of
exceedingly
loud
pattern
a
soft
felt
hat
of
the
very
latest
and
most
rakish
design
and
a
red
necktie
in
which
glittered
a
diamond
of
huge
proportions
by
main
you
mean
sammis
she
said
with
dignity
is
in
his
private
office
do
you
wish
to
see
him
what
i
came
for
originally
answered
the
young
man
staring
at
her
ardently
now
that
seen
you
almost
changed
my
mind
i
hate
to
tear
myself
away
from
this
spot
say
kid
you
make
a
big
hit
with
me
i
know
there
was
anything
so
pretty
in
this
vicinity
if
suspected
it
have
dropped
in
here
long
name
shall
i
take
in
to
sammis
inquired
the
girl
coldly
but
in
a
hurry
to
get
rid
of
me
said
the
visitor
reproachfully
if
you
insist
you
might
tell
the
boss
that
hines
is
here
jake
as
the
girl
arose
and
stepped
into
the
private
office
at
the
rear
of
the
store
hines
gazed
after
her
trim
graceful
figure
admiringly
he
said
to
himself
mighty
glad
i
called
even
if
i
sell
any
tickets
here
my
time
be
wasted
if
i
taking
this
queen
to
coney
island
before
another
week
has
passed
a
dead
dallas
reappeared
and
told
him
that
sammis
would
see
him
immediately
with
another
ardent
glance
at
her
hines
stepped
into
the
private
office
sir
what
can
i
do
for
you
inquired
the
broker
an
elderly
man
with
gray
whiskers
and
a
rather
severe
demeanor
come
to
see
how
many
tickets
take
for
the
annual
chowder
and
outing
of
the
samuel
coggswell
association
replied
hines
repeated
sammis
testily
eat
chowder
and
i
attend
outings
consequently
i
want
any
yes
you
do
retorted
hines
his
tone
almost
bullying
have
to
go
yourself
if
you
want
to
you
can
buy
the
tickets
and
give
away
to
your
friends
boss
coggswell
expects

he
swaggered
out
of
the
private
office
and
as
he
caught
sight
of
dallas
worthington
at
her
typewriter
the
scowl
disappeared
from
his
beefy
face
bright
eyes
how
would
you
like
to
run
down
to
the
island
with
me
this
evening
he
inquired
stepping
up
to
her
desk
like
it
at
all
she
answered
without
looking
up
from
her
work
he
exclaimed
ruefully
i
ask
why
not
for
several
me
for
one
thing
she
answered
glancing
at
him
scornfully
be
afraid
hines
that
on
the
way
you
might
try
to
intimidate
me
into
buying
a
ticket
for
the
coggswell

said

himself

have
overheard
what
i
said
to
her

aloud
he
said
earnestly

afraid
of
that

present
of
all
the
tickets

me
another
reason

date

engagements

strangers
said
dallas
haughtily
close
the
door
as
you
go
my
fault
that
a
stranger
said
hines
plaintively
taking
no
notice
of
the
hint
my
best
to
get
acquainted
say
give
it
to
me
straight
little
one
am
i
on
a
busy
wire
is
there
any
other
feller
ahead
of
me
is
declared
dallas
with
great
emphasis
even
if
there
sorry
for
him
the
young
man
interrupted
why
she
asked
in
astonishment
to
take
his
girl
away
from
him
i
know
who
the
feller
is
but
whoever
he
is
he
good
enough
for
you
i
never
took
much
stock
before
in
all
this
talk
about
in
love
at
first
sight
but
honest
kid
hit
me
straight
between
the
eyes
the
minute
i
came
in
here
and
saw
you
at
that
typewriter
i
you
please
close
that
door
on
the
outside
interrupted
dallas
pointing
impatiently
toward
the
street
door
got
a
lot
of
work
to
do
and
if
you
get
out
of
here
immediately
i
shall
have
to
call
very
well
said
hines
somewhat
crestfallen
guess
a
hint
for
me
to
be
so
long
girlie
drop
in
again
some
other
time
when
you
quite
so
busy
he
said
to
himself
as
he
reached
the
sidewalk
certainly
am
hard
hit
i
do
believe
that
actually
fallen
in
love
with
that
peach
and
i
even
know
her
a
short
distance
up
the
avenue
he
encountered
carrier
greene
jake
said
the
postman
i
see
you
in
office
a
few
minutes
ago
talking
to
girl
girl
demanded
the
politician
quickly
sheridan
do
you
mean
sheridan
the
carrier
that
used
to
have
this
route
answered
greene
you
know
that
keeping
company
with
that
typewriter
girl
a
fact
she
almost
cried
the
other
morning
when
i
came
in
and
told
her
that
sheridan
have
this
route
any
more
i
understand
that
going
to
be
married
believe
it
growled
hines
queen
like
that
to
marry
a
carrier
it
two
evenings
later
hines
happening
to
be
down
at
coney
island
with
a
party
of
friends
met
dallas
worthington
on
surf
avenue
walking
arm
in
arm
with
owen
sheridan
the
manner
in
which
the
girl
was
looking
up
into
her
face
caused
hines
to
utter
an
exclamation
of
jealous
rage
for
the
young
infatuation
for
dallas
had
proved
to
be
more
than
a
passing
fancy
strange
as
it
may
appear
he
had
seriously
fallen
in
love
with
the
girl
and
the
lapse
of
two
days
found
him
even
more
hard
hit
than
at
first
consequently
that
meeting
at
coney
island
was
a
great
blow
to
him
until
then
he
had
refused
to
believe
what
carrier
greene
had
told
him
and
being
an
egotistical
young
man
he
felt
confident
that
although
the
girl
appeared
to
have
somewhat
of
a
prejudice
against
him
at
the
start
she
could
not
continue
to
hold
out
for
long
against
the
charm
of
his
personality
he
returned
home
from
coney
island
with
the
dislike
which
he
had
already
formed
for
carrier
owen
sheridan
increased
tenfold
the
next
day
he
received
a
summons
from
boss
coggswell
to
come
to
the
clubhouse
immediately
when
he
got
there
he
found
that
politician
in
a
state
of
considerable
agitation
you
heard
the
news
exclaimed
the
district
leader
pacing
nervously
up
and
down
the
floor
of
his
private
office
boss
what
is
it
greene
has
been
arrested
and
tom
hovey
hovey
the
fellow
you
sent
to
get
those
letters
from
greene
what
are
they
arrested
for
inquired
hines
anxiously
with
the
mails
of
course
i
understand
got
them
dead
to
rights
too
greene
was
seen
handing
the
letters
to
hovey
and
hovey
was
caught
in
the
act
of
opening
the
envelope
over
a
steam
kettle
lawrence
has
got
a
strong
case
against
repeated
jake
hines
with
a
crafty
smile
say
that
boss
they
got
anything
on
you
and
you
can
rest
assured
that
not
be
implicated
neither
greene
nor
hovey
will
squeal
no
matter
what
happens
willing
to
stake
my
bottom
dollar
on
those
fellows
standing
pat
go
to
jail
for
life
rather
than
give
you
away
only
one
man
got
to
fear
so
far
as
that
inquired
boss
coggswell
nervously
letter
carrier
owen
sheridan
behind
these
arrests
of
course
it
was
him
that
put
judge
lawrence
wise
to
the
whole
coggswell
nodded
gloomily
and
he
can
implicate
me
by
testifying
that
i
sent
for
him
the
other
day
and
tried
to
bribe
him
to
hand
over
that
mail
his
evidence
put
you
in
stripes
boss
afraid
broke
in
jake
hines
grimly
the
only
man
got
to
be
afraid
coggswell
agitatedly
paced
the
full
length
of
the
room
several
times
before
he
spoke
again
hines
observed
that
the
ears
were
wiggling
furiously
that
peculiar
physical
indication
of
the
sinister
thoughts
that
were
brewing
within
the
crooked
brain
at
length
coggswell
halted
right
jake
he
said
very
quietly
is
dangerous
he
must
be
got
out
of
the
jake
nodded
his
head
vigorously
agree
with
you
boss
he
said
fervently
must
be
got
out
of
the
chapter
vii
the
jake
hines
forget
what
he
had
seen
down
at
coney
island
the
previous
evening
the
look
of
affection
which
had
been
in
the
eyes
of
dallas
worthington
as
she
gazed
up
into
the
face
of
owen
sheridan
the
trusting
intimate
manner
in
which
she
hung
on
her
arm
consequently
declaration
that
the
young
carrier
must
be
got
rid
of
appealed
to
him
tremendously
he
wondered
just
what
the
boss
meant
by
those
words
he
was
in
hopes
that
the
latter
was
about
to
propose
some
dark
scheme
for
kidnaping
sheridan
to
have
the
young
man
shanghaied
and
cast
away
on
some
desert
island
was
a
plan
which
in
his
present
jealous
frame
of
mind
would
have
suited
jake
to
a
he
made
no
suggestion
however
he
waited
for
coggswell
to
speak
he
knew
from
the
way
those
telltale
ears
were
wiggling
that
the
fertile
brain
was
busy
hatching
a
plan
to
bring
about
the
desired
result
after
a
prolonged
silence
coggswell
said
suddenly
must
be
no
foul
play
jake
understand
exclaimed
hines
in
incredulous
astonishment
foul
play
rough
work
i
mean
the
boss
explained
violence
you
know
very
well
that
i
like
that
sort
of
thing
a
look
of
disappointment
flitted
across
beefy
countenance
then
boss
he
inquired
must
be
silenced
by
legitimate
means
declared
the
district
leader
want
to
go
against
the
law
jake
we
want
to
forget
that
we
are
decent
citizens
i
could
not
think
of
countenancing
foul
play
in
dealing
with
this
hines
scratched
his
head
in
perplexity
and
stared
blankly
at
coggswell
he
was
relieved
to
see
that
although
there
was
a
virtuous
expression
upon
the
face
those
ears
were
still
wiggling
at
a
furious
rate
do
you
mean
by
legitimate
means
boss
he
asked
me
explain
coggswell
sat
down
in
his
desk
chair
and
motioned
his
disciple
to
a
chair
at
his
right
hand
his
agitation
had
now
completely
disappeared
once
more
he
was
the
calm
dignified
original
of
the
portrait
in
oils
which
hung
in
the
reception
hall
downstairs
as
you
have
correctly
pointed
out
jake
he
went
on
only
danger
of
my
becoming
implicated
in
this
regrettable
affair
is
through
the
testimony
of
this
carrier
owen
sheridan
greene
and
hovey
have
been
caught
it
is
true
but
i
agree
with
you
that
they
are
not
the
kind
of
fellows
who
can
be
made
to
squeal
they
will
deny
emphatically
that
they
were
obeying
my
orders
when
they
tampered
with
judge
mail
hovey
will
insist
that
he
had
reasons
of
his
own
for
wanting
to
see
the
contents
of
those
hines
nodded
quite
sure
that
both
those
fellows
can
be
relied
on
boss
pretty
tough
though
it
that
have
to
go
to
prison
coggswell
smiled
confidently
go
to
prison
quite
safe
be
admitted
to
bail
of
course
and
see
that
somebody
to
go
on
their
bond
no
matter
what
the
amount
somebody
who
mind
when
the
bail
is
forfeited
after
those
fellows
have
skipped
beyond
the
jurisdiction
of
the
hines
nodded
again
that
ought
to
be
easy
and
now
how
about
sheridan
how
are
you
going
to
prevent
him
from
dragging
you
into
this
mess
coggswell
smiled
me
answer
that
by
asking
you
a
question
jake
suppose
you
were
on
a
jury
trying
a
criminal
case
would
you
believe
the
testimony
of
a
jailbird
suppose
the
chief
witness
for
the
prosecution
was
a
young
man
who
had
just
been
tried
convicted
and
sentenced
for
being
a
thief
would
you
as
a
juryman
take
any
stock
in
what
he
had
to
say
would
not
declared
hines
virtuously
boss
coggswell
laughed
grimly
well
then
the
answer
to
your
hines
looked
bewildered
i
quite
get
you
boss
sheridan
a
yet
you
mean
jake
corrected
coggswell
in
his
quiet
smooth
voice
the
eyes
of
the
younger
man
suddenly
lighted
up
his
was
not
a
brain
but
he
fully
grasped
the
idea
now
it
appealed
to
him
greatly
too
a
prison
was
even
better
than
a
desert
island
as
a
means
of
putting
the
kibosh
on
a
rival
in
love
get
you
boss
he
exclaimed
enthusiastically
have
to
get
busy
and
dope
out
a
scheme
for
got
one
already
jake
broke
in
the
district
leader
smilingly
that
fail
to
work
successfully
all
that
have
to
do
is
to
carry
it
for
the
next
thirty
minutes
jake
hines
listened
attentively
while
his
chief
explained
in
detail
the
plan
which
he
had
evolved
it
was
a
plan
which
met
with
the
warm
approval
and
admiration
and
when
the
interview
was
at
an
end
he
went
out
with
great
enthusiasm
to
put
it
into
execution
immediately
chapter
viii
a
doubtful
joke
later
that
day
three
men
entered
a
branch
post
office
downtown
and
stepped
up
to
the
registry
window
handling
a
small
square
package
through
the
grille
one
of
them
said
to
the
clerk
wish
to
send
this
by
registered
mail
a
birthday
present
to
a
friend
of
mine
is
it
sure
to
get
there
this
afternoon
yes
the
clerk
assured
him
taking
the
package
and
making
out
a
receipt
be
uptown
in
an
hour
and
go
out
on
the
into
the
sack
went
the
little
square
package
and
soon
it
was
on
its
way
to
the
general
post
office
here
the
sack
was
opened
its
contents
rapidly
sorted
and
the
little
square
package
placed
along
with
several
other
packages
in
a
smaller
sack
which
was
sent
speeding
uptown
to
branch
x
y
when
carrier
sheridan
went
to
get
his
mail
for
the
delivery
the
little
square
package
was
waiting
there
for
him
he
glanced
at
the
address
curiously
registered
mail
was
a
rarity
on
his
new
route
which
as
has
been
stated
comprised
the
poorest
and
most
squalid
portion
of
the
district
the
package
was
addressed
to
a
michael
harrington
who
kept
a
saloon
owen
put
it
in
his
pouch
and
started
out
on
his
delivery
tour
fifteen
minutes
later
he
pushed
aside
the
swinging
doors
of
saloon
at
the
bar
of
which
was
a
group
of
about
ten
men
said
harrington
genially
from
behind
the
bar
the
good
word
have
a
little
drink
of
something
young
feller
my
birthday
and
thanks
said
owen
with
a
smile
on
the
water
wagon
but
i
wish
you
many
happy
returns
just
the
same
maybe
brought
you
a
birthday
he
produced
the
small
square
package
and
his
receipt
slip
here
guess
it
is
a
birthday
present
all
right
said
the
saloon
keeper
holding
out
his
hand
for
the
registered
package
looks
as
if
it
might
be
the
gold
watch
which
my
friend
bill
warren
telephoned
me
he
was
sending
yes
what
it
is
all
right
see
name
written
on
the
he
weighed
the
package
in
his
hand
light
though
to
contain
a
watch
it
he
remarked
should
say
so
said
owen
harrington
hastily
tore
open
the
wrapper
and
revealed
a
thin
pasteboard
box
opening
this
he
found
a
flat
watchcase
the
watch
all
right
he
said
turning
with
a
grin
to
the
group
in
the
front
of
the
bar
old
bill
the
most
generous
feller
i
know
it
decent
of
him
to
have
remembered
my
birthday
like
this
he
pressed
the
button
which
released
the
catch
of
the
watchcase
and
uttered
an
exclamation
of
astonishment
and
disgust
as
the
lid
flew
open
he
growled
what
do
you
know
about
that
the
group
at
the
bar
laughed
uproariously
on
you
mike
cried
one
cost
you
another
round
of
drinks
for
being
the
the
saloon
keeper
scowled
so
sure
that
it
is
a
joke
he
growled
with
a
suspicious
glance
toward
the
letter
carrier
who
was
just
going
out
of
the
door
know
my
friend
bill
warren
the
kind
of
man
to
play
a
trick
like
that
on
me
he
wrote
me
that
he
was
me
a
gold
watch
for
a
birthday
present
and
i
believe
he
meant
he
leaned
over
the
bar
and
called
to
owen
you
one
minute
there
young
fellow
me
inquired
the
carrier
stepping
back
into
the
barroom
are
you
quite
sure
that
this
here
registered
package
been
tampered
with
quite
sure
that
it
while
been
in
my
hands
and
i
think
find
that
the
post
office
to
blame
replied
owen
government
is
mighty
careful
in
the
handling
of
its
registered
mail
of
course
if
suspicious
he
added
can
come
around
and
see
the
superintendent
and
ask
for
an
investigation
before
i
did
that
though
if
i
were
you
get
into
communication
with
the
sender
and
ask
if
the
case
really
contained
a
watch
when
he
mailed
a
good
idea
said
harrington
get
bill
on
the
phone
right
although
he
consider
that
it
was
really
any
concern
of
his
owen
waited
while
the
saloon
keeper
telephoned
anxious
to
hear
what
the
outcome
would
be
a
few
minutes
later
harrington
turned
from
the
phone
a
grave
look
upon
his
face
as
i
thought
he
said
a
joke
at
all
bill
warren
says
to
swear
that
he
sent
that
watch
says
he
can
produce
two
witnesses
who
saw
him
put
the
watch
in
the
package
seal
it
up
and
hand
it
in
at
the
registry
he
hurriedly
donned
his
hat
and
coat
watch
has
been
stole
stole
from
the
states
mails
a
serious
offense
right
around
to
the
post
office
to
make
a
complaint
all
these
gentlemen
here
are
witnesses
that
the
watch
in
the
package
when
i
opened
the
following
day

placed
under
arrest
by
two
united

they
said
accosting
him
in
the
doorway
of
branch
x
y
as
he
came
back
from
his
tour
me
what
for
he
demanded
in
great
astonishment
robbing
the
mails
no
use
throwing
any
bluff
got
you
dead
to
suppose
this
has
to
do
with
that
watch
which
was
missing
from
the
registered
package
yesterday
said
owen
calmly
why
suspect
me
in
particular
the
package
passed
through
many
hands
while
in
the
post
but
only
one
pair
of
hands
opened
it
and
stole
its
contents
was
the
grim
retort
those
hands
were
yours
sheridan
otherwise
how
could
the
pawn
ticket
have
got
into
your
trunk
pawn
ticket
repeated
owen
blankly
we
have
just
come
from
your
boarding
house
we
went
there
to
look
your
room
over
and
we
found
the
inspector
took
from
his
pocket
a
pawn
ticket
for
a
gold
watch
and
held
it
before
the
astonished
mail
eyes
watch
this
ticket
calls
for
has
already
been
identified
as
the
watch
which
was
stolen
from
the
package
and
we
found
this
in
your
trunk
it
looks
very
much
as
if
going
to
exchange
that
gray
uniform
for
a
suit
of
stripes
carrier
to
be
continued
mistake
willie
jones
had
been
warned
several
times
for
breaches
of
school
discipline
and
was
at
length
reported
to
the
head
master
who
gave
him
a
final
warning
one
night
not
long
after
willie
was
again
caught
in
mischief
and
he
felt
that
this
time
he
was
for
a
flogging
by
the
master
was
no
joke
and
willie
determined
to
make
what
preparation
he
could
that
the
wind
might
be
tempered
to
the
shorn
lamb
on
rising
the
next
morning
he
put
on
first
his
undershirt
then
a
layer
of
stiff
brown
paper
upon
these
a
sweater
and
over
all
a
clean
white
shirt
borrowed
from
his
chum
whose
clothing
was
two
sizes
larger
than
his
own
lastly
he
put
on
his
coat
and
vest
it
was
a
very
hot
day
in
june
and
at
morning
intermission
willie
whispered
to
a
friend
nearly
stifled
i
hope
give
it
to
me
but
the
master
said
nothing
and
willie
went
on
stewing
until
dinner
time
he
felt
half
inclined
to
dispense
at
least
with
the
sweater
before
afternoon
school
but
fear
of
the
cane
deterred
him
all
through
the
afternoon
he
suffered
untold
misery
mopping
his
face
until
his
handkerchief
would
mop
no
more
but
at
length
just
before
dismissal
came
a
messenger
master
would
like
to
see
jones
in
his
on
entering
the
study
the
boy
saw
the
supple
snakelike
cane
lying
on
the
table
jones
said
the
master
can
go
on
warning
you
no
longer
you
have
brought
this
upon
yourself
but
as
it
is
your
first
visit
here
for
such
a
purpose
i
shall
make
your
punishment
somewhat
milder
hold
out
your
hand
four
on
each
hard
on
the
warden
a
phrenologist
who
has
been
touring
the
country
and
giving
lectures
in
the
art
tells
the
following
on
himself
he
was
in
the
habit
of
inviting
people
of
different
avocations
to
come
upon
the
stage
and
he
would
dilate
upon
and
expound
the
peculiarities
of
their
cranial
construction
he
had
come
to
that
portion
of
his
lecture
where
he
dealt
with
the
criminal
form
of
the
cranium
and
addressed
the
audience
there
is
any
person
present
who
at
any
time
has
been
the
inmate
of
a
prison
he
will
oblige
me
by
coming
upon
the
a
heavily
built
man
responded
to
this
invitation
admit
that
you
have
been
in
prison
sir
have
sir
was
the
unblushing
answer
you
kindly
tell
us
how
many
years
you
have
spent
behind
prison
bars
twenty
years
unhesitatingly
replied
the
subject
dear
exclaimed
the
professor
you
sit
down
please
the
subject
sat
down
in
a
chair
in
the
center
of
the
stage
the
professor
ran
his
fingers
rapidly
through
the
hair
of
the
subject
and
assumed
a
thoughtful
expression
is
a
most
excellent
specimen
the
indications
of
a
depraved
character
are
very
plainly
marked
the
organs
of
benevolence
and
esteem
are
entirely
absent
that
of
destructiveness
is
developed
to
an
abnormal
degree
i
could
have
told
instantly
without
the
confession
of
this
man
that
his
life
had
been
erratic
and
criminal
what
was
the
crime
for
which
you
were
imprisoned
never
committed
any
crime
growled
the
man
in
the
chair
you
said
that
you
had
been
an
inmate
of
a
prison
for
twenty
years
the
warden
of
the
no
more
dunning
the
landlady
of
a
certain
medical
student
who
ineffectually
dunned
her
delinquent
tenant
for
some
time
resolved
at
last
upon
resorting
to
extreme
measures
she
entered
his
room
one
morning
and
said
in
a
very
decided
tone
must
either
pay
me
my
rent
or
be
off
this
very
prefer
to
be
off
said
the
student
who
on
his
side
was
prepared
for
the
encounter
then
sir
pack
up
assure
you
madame
i
will
go
with
the
utmost
speed
if
you
will
assist
the
greatest
of
the
student
thereupon
went
to
a
wardrobe
opened
a
drawer
and
took
out
a
skeleton
which
he
handed
to
the
woman
is
that
asked
the
landlady
recoiling
a
little
oh
that
is
the
skeleton
of
my
first
landlord
he
was
inconsiderate
enough
to
claim
the
rent
for
three
quarters
that
i
owed
him
and
then
be
careful
not
to
break
it
it
is
number
one
of
my
the
landlady
was
growing
visibly
pale
the
student
opened
a
second
drawer
and
took
out
another
skeleton
this
is
my
landlady
in
south
street
a
very
worthy
woman
but
who
also
demanded
the
rent
of
two
quarters
will
you
place
it
upon
the
other
it
is
number
the
landlady
opened
her
eyes
widely
continued
the
student
is
number
three
they
are
all
here
a
very
honest
man
and
whom
i
did
not
pay
either
let
us
pass
on
to
number
but
the
landlady
was
no
longer
there
she
had
fled
an
old
dilemma
a
friend
of
mine
who
owned
a
bicycle
was
explaining
the
different
parts
to
his
grandmother
who
was
paying
him
a
visit
he
finished
up
the
account
by
saying
that
little
tube
is
where
the
air
is
blown
the
old
lady
who
had
never
seen
such
a
thing
before
was
very
much
puzzled
she
said
after
a
pause
of
contemplation
but
do
tell
me
sam
my
lad
how
on
earth
can
you
get
your
head
in
between
the
spokes
to
blow
the
air
in
the
news
of
all
nations
like
bull
in
the
china
shop
oakville
iowa
is
a
peaceful
prosperous
orderly
town
but
occasionally
some
strange
thing
happens
and
one
did
the
other
evening
about
eight
while
the
clerks
in
department
store
were
busy
about
their
evening
work
they
heard
a
noise
in
the
rear
of
the
storeroom
and
upon
investigation
found
that
a
cow
which
had
been
driven
into
town
by
some
farmer
had
found
an
open
door
and
had
come
into
the
store
and
proceeded
to
make
herself
at
home
the
clerks
got
busy
at
once
and
when
they
attempted
to
drive
bossy
out
she
became
frightened
started
to
run
and
fell
sprawling
on
the
floor
knocked
over
boxes
hardware
canned
goods
dry
goods
et
cetera
by
twisting
her
tail
until
it
resembled
a
great
auger
the
intruder
finally
consented
to
pass
out
a
criminal
catcher
for
more
than
twenty
years
joseph
le
fors
of
sheridan
has
acted
as
detective
for
the
association
of
wyoming
and
during
that
time
has
chased
criminals
all
over
the
west
and
into
mexico
le
fors
started
as
a
cowboy
in
the
southwest
his
brother
was
shot
dead
on
the
street
of
one
of
the
border
towns
joe
heard
of
the
deed
quit
his
job
came
in
and
quietly
attended
to
the
matter
of
his
burial
then
he
got
an
commission
and
went
after
the
murderer
who
was
known
as
a
when
the
cowboy
in
a
spring
wagon
and
without
much
knowledge
of
the
roads
in
that
vicinity
drove
out
of
town
on
his
mission
most
of
those
who
saw
him
guessed
that
he
would
not
come
back
but
he
returned
and
after
no
great
length
of
time
in
the
bottom
of
the
wagon
was
the
corpse
of
the
murderer
le
fors
has
never
talked
to
any
extent
of
that
fight
except
to
say
that
he
gave
the
man
a
chance
and
he
lost
among
the
most
notable
feats
was
the
capture
of
tom
horn
said
to
have
killed
seventeen
men
quickness
with
a
gun
was
marvelous
but
when
the
test
came
le
fors
proved
too
fast
for
him
it
is
said
that
le
fors
had
done
more
than
any
other
man
to
make
stock
raising
on
the
open
ranges
more
than
a
mere
venture
along
came

accidentally
tipped
over
a
box
containing
doctor
john
collection
of
thirty
snakes
in
his
biology
laboratory
at
olivet
college
olivet
she
created
something
of
a
panic
professor
dexter
had
been
offering
one
dollar
apiece
for
all
varieties
of
snakes
caught
in
eaton
county
not
already
in
his
collection
the
result
was
that
he
had
rattlesnakes
blue
racers
water
snakes
garter
snakes
and
others
reposing
in
a
large
box
in
his
laboratory
the
box
stood
on
a
high
table
miss
spencer
came
in
to
the
classroom
looking
for
the
professor
and
seeing
the
box
became
curious
to
know
its
contents
she
tried
standing
on
tiptoe
lost
her
balance
and
tumbled
the
snakes
nearly
on
top
of
herself
and
all
over
the
floor
with
a
scream
she
ran
out
of
the
room
meanwhile
professor
shedd
was
conducting
a
physics
class
in
a
room
below
when
suddenly
a
blue
racer
which
had
crawled
through
the
ventilator
dropped
with
a
thud
on
his
demonstration
table
the
class
was
automatically
dismissed
at
once
when
doctor
dexter
arrived
at
his
room
he
recaptured
most
of
the
reptiles
but
one
blue
racer
three
garter
snakes
and
a
small

still
at

two
of
the
most

roads
in

for
twenty
miles
south
of

the
road
winds
around
the
foothills
and
mountains
practically
the
entire
roadbed
having
been
cut
out
of
the
hillside
and
in
many
places
blasted
out
of
solid
rock
for
the
remaining
miles
the
way
is
over
foothills
and
through
undulating
country
besides
being
a
marvel
in
engineering
the
road
is
one
of
the
most
scenic
and
picturesque
in
the
west
passing
as
it
does
through
red

cañon
dead
cañon
and
many
other

beauty
spots
the
road
averaged
eighteen
feet
in
width
and
is
perfectly
crowned
and
drained
although
it
offers
a
succession
of
climbs
so
skillfully
was
the
engineering
work
done
that
heavy
grades
have
been
eliminated
and
the
motorist
is
confronted
with
only
one
grade
as
high
as

follows
the
ancient

that
part
of
it
between

allowed
ten
days
off

his
hair
turns
red
in

the
sensation
of
the
past
week
has
been
the
extraordinary
experience
of
mack
stewart
a
grocery
merchant
of
dublin
texas
stewart
is
years
of
age
and
was
the
possessor
of
a
head
of
hair
with
the
exception
of
a
slight
tinge
of
gray
about
the
temples
he
is
what
might
be
termed
a
man
in
a
single
night
the
pigment
of
black
was
supplanted
by
red
and
locks
changed
to
a
pronounced
auburn
stewart
who
was
formerly
a
railroad
conductor
attributes
the
remarkable
occurrence
to
a
most
vivid
dream
he
had
recently
he
says
he
dreamed
that
he
was
back
at
work
on
the
railway
he
was
standing
on
the
top
of
a
box
car
when
as
the
train
crossed
chambers
creek
his
head
was
struck
by
the
top
of
the
bridge
and
he
fell
back
with
the
blood
gushing
over
his
face
he
awoke
with
a
start
and
experienced
a
terrible
pain
in
his
head
the
train
the
creek
the
bridge
and
all
the
surroundings
were
as
distinct
as
if
he
actually
had
been
gazing
upon
them
and
the
pain
was
as
severe
as
if
he
had
really
received
a
crushing
blow
fifty
or
sixty
physicians
who
have
been
in
dublin
during
the
past
week
attending
the
erath
county
and
frisco
central
medical
associations
examined
hair
and
there
was
not
one
who
did
not
express
his
astonishment
instances
of
hair
turning
white
in
a
single
night
on
account
of
extreme
fear
mental
anguish
or
nervous
strain
have
been
known
to
occur
but
cases
of
black
hair
turning
to
red
are
almost
unheard
of
they
all
expressed
the
opinion
that
it
would
eventually
turn
to
white
mormons
increase
numbers
there
is
no
race
suicide
among
the
mormons
the
births
during
the
year
were
more
than
four
times
as
many
as
the
deaths

gives
these
figures

shot

daniel
notion
of
the
proper
manner
for
a
black
cat
to
conduct
itself
is
to
walk
ever
and
anon
in
a
straight
line
if
it
turns
in
either
direction
he
is
firmly
convinced
that
it
should
be
shot
at
sunrise
nightfall
or
whenever
the
turn
is
made
and
to
show
that
he
lives
up
to
his
convictions
he
took
a
shot
at
a
cat
shortly
before
the
milkman
appeared
on
his
rounds
missed
it
and
about
twelve
hours
later
paid
dollars
for
the
error
in
the
city
court
if
he
had
hit
the
cat
he
says
it
would
have
cost
him
nothing
when
taylor
was
a
year
and
a
half
old
he
was
taking
a
turn
about
the
nursery
when
a
large
cat
walked
in
front
of
him
it
stopped
he
stumbled
and
it
took
five
neighbors
to
regain
his
teething
ring
which
he
lost
control
of
on
the
downward
trip
from
that
day
until
one
afternoon
at
fourteen
minutes
after
three
he
has
believed
that
a
cat
passing
in
front
of
him
means
hard
luck
now
however
he
knows
it
have
you
to
say
asked
the
court
when
taylor
was
arraigned
charged
with
missing
the
cat
i
repeated
what
i
have
in
my
mind
replied
taylor
would
be
sent
to
siberia
i
missed
that
pestiferous
cat
and
i
am
sorry
for
it
i
am
a
good
citizen
but
a
poor
marksman
and
if
i
were
not
i
would
be
elsewhere
now
if
i
ever
lay
hands
on
that
blamed
cat
your
excellency
manipulate
her
nine
lives
with
éclat
and
finish
count
them
over
one
by
one
and
talk
too
much
said
the
court
answered
taylor
i
have
the
advantage
of
knowing
what
i
am
talking
about
i
know
that
when
a
black
cat
passes
in
front
of
me
it
means
hard
luck
and
unless
i
kill
it
misfortune
will
befall
me
i
know
fine

her
by

this
does
not

itself
readily
to

this

fancy
will
have
to
brace
up
and
take
it
like

may
be
more

than

all
that

said
recently
man
came
limping
into
our
front
yard
he
looked
like
a
tramp
and
then
again
he
look
like
a
tramp
i
mean
his
clothing
was
ragged
and
worn
and
he
was
limping
from
an
injury
to
his
foot
and
yet
he
have
the
manners
of
a
tramp
if
you
could
call
them
manners
man
was
penniless
he
said
and
in
trouble
i
felt
sorry
for
him
i
took
him
in
and
gave
him
some
dinner
and
then
ten
cents
to
pay
his
way
to
atlanta
on
the
trolley
line
he
seemed
very
appreciative
and
insisted
on
taking
my
name
and
address
down
in
a
little
it
seems
that
the
tramp
did
not
lose
the

after
eight

came

required
an

appeal
from

the
proffer
of
traveling

to
make
her
realize
that
an

on
their
way
to
their

with
stout

and

maria
had
a
stout

pinned
on
her

with
a

it
was
all
so
bewildering
little

winked

and
then

then
tears
come

of

this
worthy

useful
organization
is
at

the

due

is
anxious
indeed
not
to
open
the
way
for
any
such
imposition
and
exploitation
of
immigrants
as
was
practiced
before
the
immigrant
guide
service
was
organized
money
was
stolen
from
the

tickets
were
mixed
up
exorbitant
prices
for

were
extracted

who
annually
leads
expeditions
into
the

of
southern
utah
and
northern
arizona
recently
dug
up
the
remains
of
the
mysterious
animal
of
ancient
times
in
an
cliff
home
the
head
and
backbone
of
the
animal
was
all
that
could
be
found
although
the
veteran
research
worker
sought
diligently
to
find
other
bones
that
might
establish
a
clew
to
its
identity
the
cranium
is
similar
to
that
of
an
ancient
indian
with
sloping
forehead
and
average
brain
capacity
on
its
skull
was
found
a
hank
of
wool
resembling
that
of
the
modern
sheep
and
the
part
of
the
backbone
that
was
intact
showing
six
vertebræ
was
similar
in
most
respects
to
that
of
the
modern
coyote

scientists
and
students
of
other
states
have
examined
the
strange
find
but
are
at
a
loss
to
explain
its
identity
it
is
thought
by
some
to
be
a
freak
offshoot
of
the
sheep
species
while
others
identify
it
with
the
human
species
dean

had
difficulty
removing
the
body
from
the
cliff
dwelling
his
indian

and
other
native

objecting
on
grounds
that
the

might
have
contained

he
had
crawled
through

basement
window
and
had
sampled

he
went
along
till
he
got
to
the
top
floor
where
there
was
a
nice
cozy
bedroom
and
a
soft
bed
he
had
found
bread

and
was
filled
to
contentment
just
like
goldilocks
in
the
home
of
the

had
a
fine
time
then
he
got
sleepy
and
dozed
off

found
him
stretched
out
on
a
bed
upstairs
snoring
like

tiptoed
downstairs
and
called
a
policeman
the
officer
made
so
much
noise
climbing
the
stairs
that
bill
the

was
awakened
and
took
a
header
through
an
open

they
employed

they
slept

they
said
they
were
about
to
be
placed

and
decided
to
escape
they
had
covered
several
miles
in
the

garb
of
uniforms
before
their
escape
was
discovered
they
kept
far
back
from

and
at
noon
hid
in
a
ravine
at
night
they
made
a
raid
on
a
chicken
coop
and
over
an
open
fire
they
broiled
three
chickens
early
the
next
morning
they
made
a
raid
on
the
clothesline
of
a
housewife
and
obtained
enough
clothed
for
ida
oakley
to
discard
her
prison
garb
then
while
the
others
hid
in
the
woods
she
went
into
the
village
and
begged
food
and
clothes
telling
a
story
about
a
husband
with
tuberculosis
and
several
hungry
children
in
that
manner
they
obtained
plenty
of
food
but
clothes
were
scarce
particularly
garments
they
obtained
sufficient
clothes
for
several
men
but
not
enough
for
two
women
therefore
they
had
to
wear

to
get
a

wore
trousers
until
they
were
in

in
the
road
and
explained
their
predicament
the
men
purchased
skirts
for
them
but
they
had
to
continue
wearing
coats
their
appearance
in
bridgeport
where
they
tried

find

and
they
were

also
he
found
that
every
one
was
a
hero
by
the
time
he
arrived
at
guaymas
he
had
collected
photographs
and
brief
biographies
of
no
less
than
mexican
patriots
who
had
risked
their
lives
and
fortunes
that
villa
might

told
him
that

accident
several
years
ago
conners
lost
his
left
leg
and
part
of
his
right
foot
he
had
purchased
the
best
wooden
leg
that
money
could
buy
and
used
a
steel

to
fill
out
the
right
shoe
when
the
jailer
entered
his
cell
the
next
morning
artificial
leg
and

were
lying
on
the
floor
now
this
jailer
had
also
lost
his
left
leg
and
wore
a
rude
peg
in
its
place
with
a
cry
of
delight
he
pounced
upon
expensive
artificial
limb
his
delight
became
ecstasy
when
he
tried
it
on
and
found
that
it
was
a
perfect
fit
saying
something
about
a
trade
he
departed
for
some
reasons
he
also
took
the
steel
extension
the
peg

minutes
later
the

he
set
before

a
plate
of
luscious
tomatoes
that
afternoon
the
american

got
conners
out
of

wanted
to
start
out
immediately
in

of
his

but
the

persuaded
him
that
discretion
was
the
better
part
of
valor
and
induced
him
to
board
a

for

after
he
reached

remembered
that

that
it
been
found
the
hole
in
the
ground
is
four
feet
across
again
at
liberty
if
the
police
of
charlestown
succeed
in
their
efforts
to
locate
john
truslow
known
to
them
as
and
many
other
things
including
aliases
it
is
probable
that
they
will
suspend
a
large
anvil
from
his
neck
and
nail
his
clothing
to
a
cell
wall
he
has
escaped
drat
him
for
the
eighth
time
in
two
months
and
with
right
hands
raised
the
police
are
remarking
that
so
help
them
never
again
john
truslow
according
to
the
police
has
been
tried
and
found
guilty
of
every
crime
of
which
a
mentality
such
as
john
is
capable
this
has
limited
activities
greatly
but
recently
while
awaiting
trial
on
a
charge
of
stealing
a
straw
hat
he
burst
from
the
jail
nearly
sweeping
it
away
and
ran
to
the
bird
store
of
john
fisher
in
the
dead
of
a
saturday
night
there
the
police
attracted
by
eight
electric
bulbs
that
john
illuminated
found
him
whispering
to
a
gold
fish
and
acting
in
a
frightfully
suspicious
manner
they
crept
upon
him
stealthily
as
the
department
requires
them
to
do
just
as
they
reached
him
a
parrot
awakened
its
sleep
said
your
man
there
could
be
no
mistake
they
had
corroboration
when
the
reserves
with
slippery
john
sliding
along
among
them
reached
the
jail
they
saw
the
warden
come
screaming
from
the
building
they
asked
him
wherefore
the
noise
and
whence
his
course
to
which
he
replied
that
slippery
john
the
demon
skidder
had
flown
the
jail
then
he
saw
the
prisoner
and
wept
kissed
him
on
the
forehead
and
slammed
him
back
in
his
cell
all
went
well
until
the
other
night
at
the
and
justly
revered
witching
hour
of
midnight
peter
austin
member
of
a
very
aristocrooked
family
rose
up
feebly
from
his
part
of
cell
and
declared
he
was
ill
requiring
water
the
warden
who
sometimes
drinks
the
stuff
himself
was
merciful
and
let
peter
patter
out
the
cell
door
gods
what
an
error
was
left
open
and
when
peter
returned
tableaux
slippery
john
gone
again
the
warden
is
inconsolable
he
has
issued
an
order
that
hereafter
all
prisoners
that
gasp
for
water
must
remain
in
their
cells
and
drink
from
the
nozzle
of
the
hose
vaudeville
stunts
in
mountain
settlements
little
mountain
settlements
in
the
region
of
julian
have
their
vaudeville
circuits
and
they
are
as
important
to
the
people
and
afford
them
as
much
pleasure
as

seekers
of

a
handbill
pinned
to
the
door
of
the
post
office
or
store
is
the
only
program
it
announces
in
spanish
that
a
company
of
artists
unsurpassed
for
excellence
will
be
honored
to
entertain
the
people
at
greatly
reduced
prices
fifteen
cents
for
children
and
cents
for
adults
whereas
in
large
cities
like
ensenada
the
company
attempt
to
do
the
same
thing
for
less
than
a
dollar
admission
sometimes
the
performance
is
acrobatic
sometimes
it
is
a
concert
with
accordion
and
guitar
to
be
followed
with
a
dance
again
it
may
be
an
punch
and
judy
show
or
a
roaring
comedy
the
actors
speaking
their
lines
in
spanish
which
by
the
way
makes
no
difference
to
the
border
folks
all
of
whom
understand
that
tongue
in
addition
to
the
handbill
a
crier
goes
through
the
vicinity
announcing
from
house
to
house
the
merits
of
the
performers
and
urging
everybody
not
to
miss
this
last
and
only
chance
to
see
and
hear
so
rare
a
collection
of
stars
who
meanwhile
are
preparing
their
evening
meal
beside
the
road
and
making
their
beds
under
a

the

is
staged
wherever
shelter
can
be
found
in
schoolhouse
or
some
large
barn
or
more
likely
in
the
dance
hall
for
nearly
every

has
such
a
place
the
settings
are
easily
procured
a
plank
across
the

of
two
barrels
may
serve
either
as

story
of
german
herman
kepple
a
circus
rider
whose
home
was
formerly
in
afton
at
one
time
with
buffalo
wild
west
circus
and
for
several
years
a
member
of
a
german
aggregation
has
just
returned
on
account
of
the
circus
having
been
broken
up
by
the
war
in
europe
kepple
says
that
he
was
more
than
sorry
that
he
had
to
return
for
his
monthly
salary
with
the
german
show
was
equal
to
a
small
fortune
the
big
circus
was
composed
of
close
to
persons
and
rifle
shooting
riding
and
other
stunts
such
as
made
the
stolid
germans
gasp
was
specialty
as
soon
as
war
was
declared
the
cossacks
with
the
show
were
placed
in
prison
the
english
and
japanese
actors
were
taken
into
custody
and
most
of
the
german
members
had
to
join
the
colors
still
the
management
tried
to
keep
the
show
going
using
neutral
actors
and
germans
who
did
not
have
to
join
the
army
but
the
attendance
grew
less
and
less
then
as
a
last
resort
they
began
the
production
of
a
spectacular
scene
known
as
in
this
showed
with
the
crash
of
big
guns
and
the
clash
of
steel
the
progress
of
the
war
and
the
supposed
ending
all
leaning
in
favor
of
the
germans
kepple
was
supposed
to
be
a
royal
hussar
for
a
while
then
an
english
soldier
and
prisoner
of
war
at
times
he
played
dead
and
was
carried
off
the
field
the
beginning
of
the
spectacle
pictured
the
cause
of
the
war
and
ended
with
a
general
drawing
of
swords
and
presenting
of
arms
with
the
kaiser
of
course
being
the
last
one
to
draw
his
weapon
this
last
was
always
received
with
many
cheers
another
oklahoma
cowboy
beasley
and
arma
reuter
from
texas
were
with
the
same
outfit
kepple
says
that
reuter
returned
to
texas
but
does
not
know
what
became
of
beasley
always
the
germans
won
in
this
mimic
war
even
so
the
populace
soon
tired
of
it
for
the
real
war
was
carrying
off
thousands
of
the
sons
the
owners
decided
to
disband
kepple
and
reuter
concluded
to
join
the
german
army
but
when
they
found
that
they
would
have
to
renounce
their
own
country
they
backed

name
was
part
of
the
set
brought
into
the
memphis
city
court
on
a
charge
of
larceny
carried
with
him
a
minstrel
joke
that
dan
rice
used
to
knock
off
the
seats
with
years
ago
it
was
so
old
that
it
became
new
when
viewed
in
the
serious
light
in
which
the
negro
placed
it
nobody
ever
thought
that
there
was
any
foundation
for
the
old
exculpatory
joke
that
a
thief
picked
up
a
rope
that
had
a
horse
at
the
other
end
of
it
until
arthur
chairs
demonstrated
beyond
doubt
that
the
joke
had
a
foundation

serious

the
negro
was
charged
with
the
larceny
of

at

in

ellwanger
came
to
this
country
from
germany
in
and
secured
work
in
the
marianna
mine
just
the
day
before
the
explosion
that
cost
about
two
hundred
lives
on
that
day
ellwanger
was
at
work
at
the
bottom
of
the
shaft
he
told
friends
afterward
that
he
was
afraid
to
work
in
the
mine
on
account
of
the
large
amount
of
gas
he
noticed
in
the
reaches
when
the
explosion
came
he
was
knocked
senseless
but
fell
with
his
head
near
a
pool
of
water
this
kept
his
head
moist
and
saved
him
from
death
he
was
the
only
man
saved
from
the
explosion
he
was
rushed
to
a
hospital
where
the
physicians
said
he
could
not
live
pieces
of
coal
and
stone
were
taken
from
his
body
for
weeks
he
lingered
between
life
and
death
and
finally
was
pronounced
on
the
road
to
recovery
he
never
fully
recovered
unable
to
work
he
published
a
book
telling
his
story
of

promptly
attempted
