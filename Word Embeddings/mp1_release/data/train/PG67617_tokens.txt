chapter
i
an
open
question
the
solitary
ray
of
light
that
found
its
way
into
the
dismal
room
seemed
to
shrink
from
entering
silence
reigned
supreme
within
outside
even
the
stillness
of
the
night
was
hardly
broken
it
was
a
ray
of
moonlight
as
feeble
through
the
misty
air
as
ineffectual
it
found
its
way
in
nevertheless
under
one
broken
slat
of
a
closed
blind
and
then
it
seemed
to
hesitate
losing
life
and
shrinking
from
going
farther
was
there
a
lost
life
within
the
ray
of
light
came
farther
and
fell
upon
only
one
object
in
the
room
all
else
was
gloom
and
silence
it
stood
near
the
partly
open
window
and
the
closed
blinds
it
was
as
motionless
as
a
block
of
stone
as
white
as
a
figure
of
marble
as
cold
as
a
form
of
clay
its
covering
of
white
hid
it
entirely
from
view
had
there
been
eyes
to
see
it
hung
in
flimsy
folds
on
either
side
of
the
narrow
unpillowed
bed
now
and
then
a
breath
of
the
night
air
stirred
it
but
only
as
if
in
mockery
and
an
observer
would
have
shrunk
and
shuddered
lest
its
motion
had
been
imparted
by
what
it
covered
it
was
the
only
sign
of
life
amid
the
gloom
and
silence
suddenly
the
stillness
was
broken
but
only
faintly
it
was
as
if
a
bell
tolled
too
soon
the
funeral
knell
in
some
quarter
remote
from
the
dismal
room
a
clock
struck
the
hour
three
slow
mellow
strokes
of
the
bell
three
in
the
morning
five
hours
afterward
when
the
november
sun
had
risen
into
the
heavens
and
dispelled
the
night
mists
that
had
hung
over
the
potomac
and
the
capitol
a
telephone
communication
sped
from
the
office
of
the
washington
chief
of
police
to
a
suite
in
the
willard
in
which
three
persons
then
were
completing
their
toilets
for
breakfast
one
was
the
celebrated
new
york
detective
nick
carter
and
his
two
companions
were
his
two
chief
assistants
chickering
carter
and
patsy
garvan
answer
it
chief
said
patsy
who
happened
to
be
the
nearest
to
the
room
telephone
ahead
nick
nodded
can
want
me
at
this
hour
harold
garland
perhaps
or
senator
barclay
though
i
imagine
for
captain
hadley
the
chief
of
police
said
patsy
wants
to
talk
with
nick
took
the
receiver
and
called
wanted
hadley
you
nick
soon
can
you
leave
to
meet
me
hadley
if
so
then
meet
me
as
soon
as
possible
at
herman
undertaking
rooms
you
know
the
place
where
that
crook
andy
margate
who
committed
suicide
when
you
cornered
him
last
night
was
laid
out
to
remain
until
this
know
hadley
of
course
nick
replied
what
about
him
body
is
nick
echoed
amazed
it
was
stolen
in
the
night
fink
just
telephoned
me
that
he
can
not
find
said
hadley
nick
interrupted
see
what
we
can
find
i
will
join
you
there
as
soon
as
possible
i
will
leave
at
guns
chick
exclaimed
after
nick
had
told
him
what
had
occurred
body
stolen
the
meaning
of
that
are
we
up
against
another
job
in
which
that
miscreant
figures
not
cut
much
of
a
figure
in
any
kind
of
a
job
said
patsy
was
dead
as
a
doornail
when
he
was
lugged
into
back
room
i
can
swear
to
that
chief
for
i
saw
him
stripped
and
saw
doctor
nolan
view
the
body
the
district
coroner
and
ought
to
know
his
business
say
chief
you
think
that
that
rat
has
put
anything
over
on
us
do
you
the
last
came
from
patsy
when
he
noticed
the
serious
expression
that
had
settled
on
face
hardly
think
so
though
the
bare
possibility
of
it
occurred
to
me
nick
replied
hastening
to
finish
his
toilet
smoke
it
seem
was
a
crafty
dog
nick
added
knew
more
than
a
wooden
indian
no
i
think
of
course
that
he
can
have
fooled
that
would
be
the
last
straw
i
believe
theft
of
his
body
nevertheless
unless
it
can
be
traced
and
proved
to
have
been
disposed
of
in
some
way
is
a
serious
so
nick
margate
was
a
dangerous
crook
the
disappearance
of
his
remains
is
a
thousand
times
more
serious
in
view
of
all
of
the
possibilities
involved
than
would
be
that
of
an
ordinary
person
if
margate
is
still
alive
incredible
though
it
seems
he
again
becomes
a
dangerous
menace
to
true
chick
admitted
great
guns
it
seems
utterly
incredible
the
undertaker
or
surely
the
physician
would
have
detected
it
besides
we
saw
him
keel
over
toes
up
when
he
swallowed
poison
and
a
moment
nick
interrupted
positively
know
that
it
was
poison
not
dead
sure
of
it
now
in
view
of
what
has
suspect
that
it
was
only
a
drug
is
that
instantly
caused
a
condition
resembling
death
but
from
which
he
revived
later
tricks
have
been
is
nothing
in
speculation
nick
again
interposed
defer
breakfast
until
we
have
looked
into
the
matter
there
may
be
evidence
that
will
definitely
settle
hope
had
better
both
go
with
me
nick
added
the
body
has
indeed
been
stolen
we
must
find
a
way
to
trace
it
and
make
absolutely
sure
that
there
was
no
monkey
business
in
the
death
of
andy
margate
i
shall
not
rest
easy
while
any
doubts
exist
concerning
the
fate
of
that
designing
it
then
was
eight
precisely
ten
hours
since
nick
carter
and
his
assistants
had
rounded
up
margate
and
his
three
confederates
for
the
murder
of
father
cleary
a
roman
catholic
priest
and
the
abduction
of
lottie
trent
the
girl
employed
in
the
war
department
who
had
confided
to
the
priest
the
details
of
a
plot
to
blackmail
harold
garland
an
engineer
in
the
same
department
as
well
as
the
father
of
his
fianc√©e
senator
barclay
both
of
whom
had
previously
been
seriously
involved
in
the
theft
of
secret
fortification
plans
by
margate
and
a
gang
of
foreign
spies
all
of
whom
had
been
run
down
by
the
three
detectives
cornered
by
nick
and
his
assistants
the
previous
night
one
of
the
crooks
had
been
fatally
wounded
two
of
them
arrested
and
their
ringleader
margate
had
committed
suicide
by
swallowing
poison
from
a
vial
seized
from
his
pocket
there
had
appeared
to
be
no
reasonable
doubt
of
it
the
district
medical
examiner
who
viewed
the
body
pronounced
the
man
dead
and
ordered
the
removal
of
the
corpse
to
the
rooms
of
an
undertaker
until
morning
it
then
being
too
late
to
have
it
placed
in
the
city
morgue
pending
the
necessary
legal
steps
in
such
cases
thus
it
occurred
that
the
corpse
of
andy
margate
or
the
supposed
corpse
if
nick
present
misgivings
were
warranted
rested
that
night
in
the
back
room
of
herman
undertaking
establishment
to
which
nick
and
his
assistants
repaired
as
quickly
as
possible
after
the
astounding
telephone
communication
from
captain
hadley
that
morning
the
chief
had
just
arrived
when
nick
entered
with
chick
and
patsy
they
found
him
in
the
front
office
talking
with
herman
fink
and
doctor
nolan
the
coroner
who
had
viewed
the
body
the
previous
night
and
who
was
solely
responsible
for
the
temporary
disposal
of
it
in
charge
of
the
undertaker
the
ruddy
face
of
herman
fink
who
was
a
short
corpulent
little
german
evinced
not
only
his
consternation
over
what
had
occurred
but
also
the
fact
that
he
was
utterly
incapable
of
having
connived
in
any
way
at
the
theft
of
the
notorious
remains
here
is
carter
now
captain
hadley
exclaimed
when
the
three
detectives
entered
a
fine
mess
nick
for
fair
i
have
known
live
crooks
to
slip
through
the
fingers
of
the
police
but
never
a
dead
one
this
is
the
first
case
on
have
no
precedent
then
to
serve
us
as
a
guide
nick
replied
smiling
a
bit
grimly
there
any
question
then
as
to
the
theft
of
the
body
herman
fink
threw
up
his
pudgy
hands
and
exclaimed
before
chief
hadley
could
reply
gott
vot
a
question
not
der
slightest
carter
not
der
slightest
how
can
there
be
any
question
der
pody

from
my
pack

lugged
out
through
der
vindow
come
in
and
see
for
yourself
der
plinds
moment
nick
interposed
detaining
him
will
presently
make
an
investigation
i
understand
doctor
nolan
that
you
were
present
when
body
was
brought
here
last
the
physician
bowed
looking
inexpressibly
annoyed
over
what
had
occurred
and
evidently
feeling
that
he
was
in
a
measure
responsible
for
it
was
here
carter
he
replied
remained
until
after
fink
and
his
assistant
had
stripped
the
body
and
laid
it
out
it
was
nearly
one
mind
you
which
was
the
only
reason
why
i
deferred
sending
it
to
the
morgue
until
this
morning
a
thought
of
its
being
stolen
did
not
enter
my
mind
i
would
not
have
believed
it
view
of
what
has
occurred
can
you
believe
it
possible
that
the
man
was
not
dead
nick
asked
a
bit
dryly
dead
doctor
nolan
echoed
with
a
look
of
derision
no
certainly
not
that
is
absurd
carter
i
know
that
he
was
feel
absolutely
sure
of
it
eh
certainly
do
you
make
any
tests
to
verify
your
opinion
did
not
doctor
nolan
declared
a
bit
brusquely
test
was
necessary
i
can
tell
when
a
man
is
dead
carter
without
resorting
to
gracious
fink
exclaimed
starting
with
a
sort
of
ludicrous
commiseration
at
the
detective
an

vorst
i
ever
heard
i
know
der
man
vas
nick
did
not
resent
these
positive
assertions
of
both
the
physician
and
the
undertaker
he
knew
much
better
than
they
however
to
what
consummate
trickery
knaves
of
caliber
sometimes
resort
and
he
was
better
informed
than
either
of
the
ways
and
means
that
make
it
possible
infer
fink
that
the
body
was
not
embalmed
or
you
would
have
said
so
nick
replied
sir

yet
i
anticipated
no
such
occasion
as
on
to

doctor
nick
directed
careful
chemical
analysis
may
become
necessary
now
fink
lead
the
way
to
your
back
room
see
what
i
make
of
this
extraordinary
chapter
ii
a
curious
clew
nick
carter
lost
no
time
in
seeking
evidence
that
would
prove
conclusively
that
body
had
really
been
stolen
he
followed
fink
through
an
interior
room
in
which
numerous
coffins
and
caskets
were
displayed
in
casements
of
the
walls
and
adjoining
which
was
the
back
room
in
which
the
body
had
lain
it
was
about
twelve
feet
square
two
windows
overlooked
a
small
back
yard
from
which
a
narrow
alley
led
out
to
a
side
street
the
yard
was
some
six
feet
lower
than
the
avenue
on
which
the
building
fronted
and
below
the
back
room
was
a
basement
used
for
a
workroom
and
storage
purposes
a
door
led
from
the
basement
into
the
yard
the
bare
bier
stood
nearly
in
the
middle
of
the
room
the
blinds
of
one
of
the
windows
was
open
the
others
closed
a
sheet
with
which
the
body
had
been
covered
was
missing
the
garments
removed
from
the
corpse
the
previous
night
hung
on
hooks
in
one
of
the
walls
nick
quickly
took
in
these
features
of
the
scene
and
he
speedily
learned
from
fink
that
both
blinds
had
been
closed
the
night
before
that
one
window
was
open
a
few
inches
that
a
door
leading
to
the
basement
stairs
was
both
locked
and
bolted
as
was
true
of
the
lower
one
leading
into
the
yard
neither
of
them
appeared
to
have
been
opened
by
the
crooks
these
all
of
the
garments
removed
from
the
body
nick
inquired
glancing
at
them
sir
every
piece
fink
declared
remains
were
covered
you
say
sir
with
a
sheet
but
that
is
gone
said
the
undertaker
certainly
looks
like
a
genuine
case
of
body
snatching
chick
remarked
that
your
misgivings
are
warranted
nick
and
that
margate
tricked
us
with
a
drug
and
afterward
revived
he
surely
would
have
put
on
his
clothing
before
departing
he
would
not
have
left
here
unclad
or
wrapped
only
in
the
missing
be
hanged
doctor
nolan
said
derisively
nonsense
that
theory
feet
to
stand
does
seem
highly
improbable
added
chief
hadley
gravely
shaking
his
head
see
no
reasonable
grounds
for
such
a
suspicion
it
appears
dead
open
and
shut
that
the
corpse
was
must
then
find
positive
evidence
of
it
nick
replied
crooks
must
have
left
their
tracks
it
do
to
remain
in
any
uncertainty
concerning
the
death
of
margate
this
matter
must
be
positively
doctor
nolan
scornfully
blurted
already
is
settled
no
question
about
nick
carter
did
not
reply
he
saw
nothing
to
be
gained
by
an
argument
in
support
of
his
seemingly
absurd
suspicions
taking
a
powerful
lens
from
his
pocket
nick
fell
to
inspecting
the
floor
the
sill
of
the
open
window
and
the
outside
of
the
faded
green
blinds
on
the
floor
near
the
bier
were
particles
of
dry
dirt
as
if
tracked
in
on
soiled
shoes
the
dust
on
the
stone
outside
of
the
window
had
recently
been
disturbed
while
that
on
the
slats
of
the
blinds
plainly
showed
the
marks
of
fingers
evidently
thrust
between
them
in
order
to
pull
open
the
blinds
glancing
down
into
the
unpaved
yard
nick
then
discovered
two
quite
deep
holes
in
the
damp
ground
some
three
feet
from
the
wall
and
directly
opposite
the
window
he
called
attention
to
them
remarking
quietly
was
a
short
ladder
set
up
against
this
see
indications
are
indeed
that
margate
was
really
dead
and
that
his
body
was
stolen
either
that
chick
or
he
had
confederates
who
removed
and
afterward
revived
how
could
they
have
learned
that
he
was
brought
here
chick
questioned
doubtfully
was
nearly
midnight
when
we
rounded
him
up
and
he
was
brought
directly
here
from
the
building
in
which
we
cornered
him
who
could
have
learned
about
it
and
how
between
half
past
one
and
daylight
to
say
nothing
of
having
framed
up
and
pulled
off
such
a
job
remains
to
be
learned
nick
replied
will
that
alone
be
sufficient
his
body
must
be
traced
and
found
go
down
with
me
to
the
yard
have
a
look
in
the
fink
led
the
way
and
unlocked
the
doors
of
you
except
chick
remain
in
the
basement
nick
directed
when
the
others
followed
him
down
the
stairs
there
are
any
footprints
to
be
found
outside
or
evidence
of
any
kind
i
want
them
obliterated
they
may
prove
to
be
of
doctor
nolan
exclaimed
take
it
carter
that
you
are
coming
to
my
way
of
is
evidence
in
support
of
your
belief
nick
frankly
admitted
disregarding
the
tinge
of
sarcasm
with
which
the
physician
had
spoken
thought
you
would
find
may
find
something
more
perhaps
before
i
end
my
work
in
this
voice
took
on
a
more
subtle
ring
when
he
replied
stepping
out
into
the
yard
with
his
chief
assistant
there
in
the
damp
earth
they
found
numerous
hardly
discernible
footprints
most
of
them
near
the
two
holes
nick
had
observed
from
the
window
or
leading
toward
a
gate
opening
into
the
alley
all
of
them
were
so
intermingled
and
partly
effaced
however
that
they
were
of
little
value
after
carefully
inspecting
them
nevertheless
nick
said
quietly
men
have
been
here
i
think
that
was
the
number
judging
from
these
faint
imprints
one
of
them
held
a
short
ladder
while
the
others
entered
that
window
they
brought
out
the
body
whether
dead
or
alive
and
got
away
with
still
suspect
trickery
on
part
questioned
chick
do
said
nick
believe
there
is
something
more
than
a
coincidence
in
the
theft
of
this
body
so
soon
after
his
supposed
suicide
we
must
go
deeper
however
before
i
can
form
a
more
definite
opinion
have
a
look
in
the
nick
found
the
gate
unbolted
and
called
attention
to
it
did
not
delay
to
fasten
it
he
remarked
here
is
something
of
more
significance
the
body
was
taken
away
in
a
jove
as
true
as
death
and
taxes
chick
agreed
after
following
nick
through
the
gate
also
indicates
at
least
that
the
persons
who
stole
the
body
supposed
margate
to
be
does
appear
the
earth
in
the
alley
was
more
damp
than
in
the
yard
and
was
of
a
grayish
clay
that
readily
retained
an
imprint
that
which
at
once
had
caught
eye
was
that
of
a
long
box
such
as
caskets
are
inclosed
in
for
burial
it
had
been
placed
on
the
ground
into
which
it
had
sunk
just
enough
to
leave
a
perfectly
definite
impression
of
its
outlines
presumably
when
a
heavy
body
was
placed
in
it
through
the
alley
leading
to
the
side
street
moreover
were
numerous
footprints
but
these
were
so
intermingled
and
partly
obliterated
like
those
in
the
yard
as
to
be
of
no
great
value
crouching
upon
the
ground
however
nick
made
a
discovery
that
would
have
escaped
the
observation
of
most
men
it
was
hardly
perceptible
but
the
keen
eyes
of
the
famous
detective
seldom
missed
anything
out
of
the
ordinary
jove
a
remarkable
clew
said
he
suddenly
looking
up
remember
none
like
do
you
mean
nick
pointed
to
the
rectangular
surface
contained
within
the
plainly
discernible
outlines
of
the
box
gracious
there
are
some
more
faint
marks
on
the
damp
clay
said
chick
bending
nearer
nick
nodded
do
you
make
of
them
side
of
the
box
that
came
next
to
the
ground
was
marked
with
the
ordinary
ink
and
brush
such
as
shippers
use
there
probably
was
an
address
marked
on
the
transferred
to
the
clay
the
damp
clay
moistened
the
ink
and
has
retained
parts
of
some
of
the
more
heavily
marked
letters
chiefly
the
capital
are
faint
and
much
blurred
however
as
well
as
reversed
in
position
but
yes
i
am
right
here
are
two
at
the
end
of
an
address
marked
on
the
look
like
two
small
letters
a
and
an
said
chick
twisting
so
as
to
view
them
better
correct
said
nick
using
his
lens
are
the
final
letters
of
the
word
college
here
is
the
loop
of
one
also
the
larger
curve
of
the
capital
jove
very
significant
said
chick
may
have
been
the
crime
of
medical
students
who
wanted
a
body
for
begin
to
think
you
determine
any
of
the
other
letters
three
capitals
said
nick
still
scrutinizing
the
blurred
marks
with
his
lens
appears
to
be
two
quite
long
words
preceding
the
word
immediately
preceding
it
begins
with
it
may
be
chick
quickly
suggested
am
quite
sure
of
are
the
others
seems
to
be
two
words
preceding
that
or
one
very
long
one
said
nick
are
so
blurred
that
i
can
not
read
them
the
first
capital
in
the
address
however
is
a
evidently
is
the
name
of
a
medical
think
location
is
not
legible
only
a
capital
evidently
that
of
the
word
no
numerals
are
box
must
originally
have
contained
something
that
was
shipped
to
a
local
medical
college
said
chick
the
initial
to
aid
us
and
the
fact
that
it
is
in
one
of
the
city
streets
not
an
avenue
the
directory
should
enable
us
to
identify
will
see
after
going
a
step
farther
replied
nick
rising
and
replacing
his
lens
in
his
pocket
wish
to
inspect
this
side
he
led
the
way
while
speaking
and
paused
on
the
curbing
of
the
sidewalk
the
street
was
a
narrow
unpaved
one
flanked
on
both
sides
with
inferior
stores
with
dwelling
apartments
above
a
street
that
was
only
dimly
lighted
after
the
early
hours
of
the
evening
the
ground
was
somewhat
muddy
from
recent
rain
and
near
the
curbing
were
plainly
discernible
the
tracks
of
a
wagon
and
the
footprints
of
the
horses
attached
to
it
team
stopped
here
last
night
said
nick
pointing
was
a
fourth
man
in
the
do
you
think
so
here
are
four
tracks
of
tires
close
to
the
curbing
there
would
be
only
two
those
of
the
front
and
rear
wheels
if
there
had
been
only
one
stop
am
sure
there
were
three
men
who
took
the
body
from
the
back
room
nick
added
less
could
have
accomplished
it
without
being
heard
they
would
not
have
dared
to
leave
their
team
standing
here
all
the
while
the
fourth
man
drove
away
and
returned
to
get
his
confederates
and
their
burden
why
we
find
four
tracks
here
instead
of
only
chick
agreed
no
getting
around
wagon
had
rubber
tires
moreover
and
yes
by
jove
one
of
them
was
patched
or
mended
here
are
the
marks
left
in
two
places
by
a
seam
or
where
some
new
rubber
was
vulcanized
to
the
old
this
will
help
some
i
can
bank
on
that
nick
all
nothing
about
this
to
others
nick
directed
will
follow
up
these
clews
and
see
to
what
they
lead
chick
before
making
any
good
return
to
the
as
they
retraced
their
steps
through
the
alley
nick
obliterated
the
evidence
found
there
treading
out
the
imprint
of
the
box
with
his
boots
what
have
you
learned
chief
hadley
asked
when
the
two
detectives
entered
and
rejoined
the
group
in
the
basement
have
been
gone
long
enough
to
have
discovered
to
further
confirm
doctor
opinion
nick
replied
a
bit
dryly
body
was
taken
away
by
four
men
who
came
in
a
doctor
nolan
exclaimed
was
reasonably
sure
of
is
no
other
evidence
worthy
of
mention
nick
added
may
be
well
chief
to
have
an
officer
inquire
at
the
dwellings
in
the
side
street
the
crooks
possibly
were
heard
or
even
seen
without
the
truth
being
will
attend
to
it
hadley
nodded
while
they
returned
to
the
office
of
the
undertaker
is
nothing
more
to
be
learned
here
said
nick
will
look
deeper
into
the
case
however
and
will
report
to
you
so
nick
by
all
that
vial
doctor
nolan
i
want
you
to
let
chick
take
it
for
a
few
hours
nick
added
turning
to
the
physician
want
an
analysis
of
its
contents
or
the
nature
of
it
to
be
positively
determined
i
will
be
responsible
for
its
safe
good
enough
for
me
carter
doctor
nolan
readily
assented
will
call
at
your
office
for
it
later
in
the
nick
did
not
defer
his
departure
to
further
discuss
the
matter
he
left
chief
hadley
and
the
coroner
to
proceed
as
they
saw
fit
and
herman
fink
in
quite
abject
consternation
over
the
gruesome
calamity
that
had
befallen
him
now
will
hunt
up
a
directory
nick
remarked
walking
up
the
street
with
chick
and
patsy
decided
not
to
consult
the
one
in
would
have
led
hadley
to
suspect
that
we
are
wise
to
something
smiled
chick
have
you
picked
up
questioned
patsy
surprised
chick
informed
him
ending
just
as
they
arrived
at
a
corner
drug
store
into
which
nick
led
the
way
a
city
directory
supplied
him
with
the
information
he
was
seeking
we
have
it
said
he
while
chick
and
patsy
eagerly
read
the
address
to
which
he
pointed
dabney
private
medical
jove
there
is
no
question
about
it
chick
declared
that
was
the
word
that
bothered
me
nick
added
first
two
words
looked
like
a
single
exceedingly
long
one
this
certainly
does
settle
it
come
on
not
wait
for
breakfast
find
out
doing
in
this
dabney
private
medical
college
there
shall
be
nothing
too
private
for
us
to
butt
into
chick
take
my
word
for
chapter
iii
the
empty
box
gifted
with
more
than
ordinary
intuition
as
well
as
a
remarkably
keen
perception
resulting
from
years
of
trained
experience
nick
carter
already
felt
sure
that
the
case
engaging
him
had
features
that
did
not
yet
appear
on
the
surface
and
that
it
might
prove
to
be
one
of
the
strangest
cases
on
record
it
still
was
comparatively
early
only
nine
when
nick
arrived
with
chick
and
patsy
in
the
neighborhood
of
the
dabney
private
medical
college
from
a
policeman
whom
he
met
and
whose
beat
was
in
that
locality
nick
learned
that
the
institution
was
a
small
one
having
usually
only
about
twenty
students
and
that
it
was
conducted
solely
by
one
doctor
david
dabney
a
physician
of
good
reputation
recognized
ability
and
a
man
of
considerable
means
the
last
was
manifest
in
the
locality
and
appearance
of
the
place
presently
viewed
from
a
near
distance
by
the
detectives
it
occupied
a
corner
estate
of
considerable
size
containing
an
attractive
stone
residence
and
a
near
building
of
brick
to
which
an
annex
evidently
had
been
added
and
beyond
which
were
a
stable
and
garage
the
driveway
to
which
was
entered
from
a
side
street
all
were
of
a
superior
type
while
the
grounds
were
adorned
with
numerous
shade
trees
the
branches
of
some
of
which
mingled
with
those
in
the
rear
of
a
fine
estate
forming
on
a
fashionable
avenue
the
latter
struck
nick
as
being
somewhat
familiar
but
seeing
only
the
rear
of
the
handsome
wooden
residence
which
was
almost
hidden
by
the
intervening
trees
and
not
having
approached
by
the
way
of
the
avenue
he
did
not
then
recall
when
he
had
previously
seen
it
or
who
dwelt
there
in
view
of
what
the
policeman
had
told
him
and
which
the
appearance
of
the
dabney
place
seemed
to
confirm
nick
quickly
decided
how
he
would
proceed
the
physician
is
all
that
the
officer
stated
he
would
not
countenance
the
theft
of
a
corpse
even
that
of
a
crook
and
the
job
must
have
been
secretly
done
by
some
of
his
students
assuming
that
we
are
in
right
said
nick
after
sizing
up
the
place
now
seems
reasonable
chick
agreed
we
ought
to
be
able
to
cinch
it
said
patsy
wagon
and
box
must
be
here
as
well
as
the
body
even
though
that
may
have
been
concealed
we
ought
to
be
able
to
find
find
them
patsy
if
they
are
there
nick
replied
enter
and
have
a
talk
with
dabney
you
two
saunter
around
to
the
side
street
from
which
the
driveway
leads
to
the
stable
and
garage
keep
your
eyes
open
and
hold
up
any
one
who
attempts
to
leave
while
i
am
getting
in
my
work
i
think
i
can
drive
the
game
from
ahead
chick
nodded
follow
in
a
few
nick
moved
on
and
presently
entered
a
walk
leading
to
the
residence
a
man
came
out
of
a
side
door
at
the
same
moment
and
started
to
cross
the
grounds
toward
the
brick
building
mentioned
upon
seeing
nick
however
he
turned
and
approached
him
he
was
a
tall
spare
man
of
about
sixty
with
and
rather
angular
features
a
prominent
nose
eyes
and
a
high
brow
he
was
clad
in
a
black
suit
with
a
long
frock
coat
which
accentuated
the
height
of
his
somewhat
attenuated
figure
he
bowed
when
the
detective
drew
nearer
saying
with
an
agreeable
voice
morning
nick
returned
the
greeting
then
added
am
looking
for
doctor
need
look
no
farther
smiled
the
physician
am
doctor
dabney
what
can
i
do
for
you
will
you
walk
into
the
house
think
not
nick
replied
knowing
that
what
he
sought
would
not
be
found
in
the
house
name
is
ryder
i
have
a
nephew
who
wishes
to
become
a
physician
and
i
am
thinking
of
sending
him
here
for
tuition
if
agreeable
to
doctor
dabney
brightened
perceptibly
will
be
decidedly
agreeable
ryder
he
said
extending
his
hand
to
shake
that
of
the
detective
am
always
glad
to
add
to
the
list
of
my
students
how
old
is
your
nephew
has
just
turned
very
good
age
at
which
to
begin
a
course
of
medical
study
do
you
reside
in
washington
nick
replied
that
he
did
not
and
he
then
proceeded
to
make
a
few
consistent
inquiries
as
to
terms
and
accommodations
for
students
and
he
wound
up
with
remarking
you
can
spare
the
time
doctor
dabney
or
will
have
some
one
conduct
me
i
would
like
to
inspect
your
college
building
and
its
various
departments
i
infer
that
you
have
no
the
contrary
doctor
dabney
said
quickly
will
be
more
than
pleased
to
show
you
around
i
am
to
give
a
lecture
in
the
dissecting
room
in
half
an
hour
but
i
shall
have
ample
time
to
accompany
dissecting
room
that
is
one
place
i
would
specially
like
to
visit
said
nick
with
manifest
interest
can
conveniently
begin
with
that
for
it
is
in
the
annex
said
doctor
dabney
pointing
toward
the
rear
of
the
brick
building
with
me
some
of
my
students
are
beginning
to
arrive
you
see
they
are
the
ones
whose
homes
are
in
or
near
the
city
i
at
present
have
only
twenty
students
who
are
quartered
in
the
college
though
we
have
accommodations
for
twice
that
nick
had
already
observed
that
several
young
men
were
entering
from
the
side
street
while
others
were
gathered
near
a
door
leading
into
the
annex
he
was
quick
to
detect
moreover
that
a
group
of
three
in
front
of
the
garage
and
stable
were
betraying
a
much
more
serious
interest
in
him
while
he
approached
with
the
physician
they
were
talking
earnestly
and
viewing
him
with
a
furtive
apprehensive
scrutiny
which
with
their
noticeable
paleness
at
once
convinced
him
that
they
were
the
culprits
he
was
seeking
nick
evinced
no
special
interest
in
them
however
but
remarked
to
the
physician
following
up
the
topic
under
discussion
suppose
you
find
it
difficult
at
times
to
obtain
subjects
for
dissection
doctor
dabney
heard
him
without
a
change
of
countenance
yes
at
times
he
admitted
can
be
obtained
only
through
the
proper
authorities
and
by
paying
a
fixed
price
that
is
to
say
of
course
unless
one
resorts
to
felonious
methods
to
get
them
he
added
smiling
significantly
i
would
not
sanction
anything
of
that
suppose
not
for
a
moment
doctor
dabney
declared
nick
believed
him
he
saw
plainly
enough
that
the
physician
was
not
only
a
man
of
character
but
also
that
he
had
too
much
at
stake
to
have
connived
at
such
a
crime
as
had
been
committed
the
previous
night
they
had
been
following
a
driveway
passing
the
garage
and
stable
in
the
latter
a
hostler
was
washing
a
covered
wagon
and
nick
glanced
in
and
noted
that
the
wheels
had
rubber
tires
a
few
more
steps
brought
them
to
the
annex
of
the
brick
building
a
door
leading
into
a
broad
corridor
with
a
cement
floor
was
wide
open
instead
of
immediately
entering
however
doctor
dabney
turned
to
another
door
some
twelve
feet
to
the
right
remarking
while
he
opened
it
of
subjects
for
dissection
ryder
i
will
begin
with
showing
you
where
they
are
kept
until
wanted
the
door
in
the
rear
leads
directly
into
the
dissecting
room
where
i
give
many
of
my
nick
peered
into
the
cold
basement
room
which
the
physician
disclosed
it
was
lighted
with
only
a
single
narrow
window
high
in
one
of
the
walls
the
door
in
the
rear
wall
was
closed
on
a
low
stone
shelf
at
one
side
a
covered
figure
was
lying
gruesome
in
its
suggestiveness
but
the
size
of
which
at
once
convinced
nick
that
it
could
not
be
the
body
of
andy
margate
near
the
opposite
wall
nevertheless
and
equally
convincing
to
the
detective
stood
a
long
narrow
box
somewhat
faded
and
defaced
which
nick
saw
at
a
glance
was
about
the
size
of
the
imprint
found
in
the
alley
back
of
undertaking
rooms
not
a
very
agreeable
sight
ryder
but
i
thought
you
might
wish
to
omit
nothing
in
connection
with
my
establishment
said
doctor
dabney
in
apologetic
tones
right
nick
replied
you
mind
if
i
step
in
not
said
the
physician
with
a
look
of
surprise
things
do
not
affect
me
seriously
nick
added
room
appears
well
adapted
to
what
is
required
of
it
may
i
ask
doctor
dabney
what
this
box
contains
nick
touched
it
with
his
foot
whatever
it
is
you
sure
of
it
of
it
certainly
exclaimed
the
physician
was
put
here
only
temporarily
it
contained
the
casement
in
which
a
skeleton
was
recently
shipped
to
me
from
new
york
the
skeleton
has
been
removed
and
is
now
in
the
dissecting
nick
turned
and
regarded
him
more
sharply
you
be
surprised
doctor
dabney
if
i
were
to
tell
you
that
the
box
now
contains
a
corpse
he
inquired
would
hardly
express
it
doctor
dabney
replied
with
a
shrug
would
not
call
you
a
liar
of
course
but
i
would
say
that
you
never
were
more
mistaken
in
your
doctor
the
one
who
would
be
mistaken
said
nick
pointedly
you
mean
mean
just
what
i
say
doctor
dabney
this
box
now
contains
a
how
could
a
moment
nick
again
interrupted
see
whether
i
am
right
it
is
a
matter
that
can
be
easily
and
quickly
settled
see
for
yourself
doctor
nick
had
previously
noticed
that
the
screws
had
been
removed
from
the
cover
of
the
box
though
it
still
remained
in
position
he
bent
over
while
speaking
and
seized
one
side
of
it
then
tipped
it
over
on
the
floor
no
cry
of
amazement
came
from
the
physician
the
detective
was
the
one
who
drew
back
with
surprise
quite
naturally
of
course
doctor
dabney
now
began
to
suspect
some
ulterior
motive
for
the
conduct
he
straightened
up
with
a
frown
saying
a
bit
brusquely
is
no
place
for
a
jest
ryder
as
you
should
know
without
being
told
if
you
are
not
what
you
pretend
and
have
any
reason
for
thinking
that
this
box
contained
a
body
i
beg
to
inform
you
moment
doctor
if
you
please
nick
interposed
will
presently
explain
to
your
entire
nick
turned
over
the
box
while
he
was
speaking
he
found
on
the
lower
side
a
blurred
black
address
printed
with
a
marking
brush
the
wood
still
was
damp
and
soiled
with
grayish
clay
moreover
which
alone
would
have
convinced
him
that
he
had
made
no
mistake
nick
did
not
immediately
explain
to
the
physician
however
who
stood
watching
him
with
a
darker
frown
on
his
thin
face
he
saw
that
about
a
dozen
of
the
students
had
gathered
in
the
driveway
near
by
all
of
them
men
in
the
twenties
and
among
them
the
three
whom
he
had
seen
talking
so
earnestly
near
the
stable
nick
stepped
out
and
approached
the
group
apparently
with
no
aggressive
intentions
until
turning
abruptly
to
one
of
the
three
he
said
sternly
what
have
you
done
with
it
the
man
addressed
was
about
and
quite
a
powerful
fellow
set
up
like
an
athlete
with
dark
features
and
somewhat
sinister
eyes
with
what
he
demanded
appear
to
be
addressing
right
nick
nodded
am
addressing
you
and
your
two
companions
and
your
faces
alone
warrant
what
i
am
saying
what
have
you
done
with
it
know
what
you
mean
snapped
the
other
you
think
one
moment
nick
sternly
interrupted
know
young
man
which
is
much
more
than
to
merely
think
you
three
men
with
a
fourth
to
aid
you
stole
a
corpse
last
night
from
the
back
room
of
herman
fink
the
undertaker
you
used
the
wagon
in
yonder
stable
you
stopped
in
the
side
street
entered
through
an
alley
and
with
a
short
ladder
you
took
the
body
through
the
back
window
you
put
it
in
that
box
which
you
already
had
placed
in
the
alley
and
afterward
brought
it
guess
not
cried
the
same
man
defiantly
talking
through
your
hat
is
my
name
nick
carter
the
detective
again
cut
in
may
have
heard
of
me
whether
you
have
or
not
is
immaterial
i
can
prove
all
that
i
have
said
and
only
the
truth
if
you
chose
to
make
a
clean
breast
of
the
whole
business
will
save
you
fellows
from
ah
here
is
additional
evidence
if
that
were
needed
it
appears
that
your
confederate
the
fourth
man
was
about
to
nick
had
caught
sight
of
chick
and
patsy
approaching
from
the
side
street
each
grasping
the
arm
of
a
tall
pale
young
man
who
appeared
to
be
on
the
verge
of
fainting
chapter
iv
marked
in
dust
the
mention
of
nick
name
following
close
upon
his
positive
accusations
produced
an
immediate
change
in
the
attitude
of
the
three
recreant
medical
students
defiance
vanished
like
a
flash
from
the
face
of
the
one
who
had
been
talking
and
whom
nick
now
suspected
of
being
the
leader
in
the
crime
of
the
previous
night
another
was
trembling
visibly
while
the
third
impulsively
blurted
as
if
impelled
by
the
advice
nothing
to
it
oakley
but
to
confess
the
whole
business
neither
bluff
nor
bluster
will
cut
any
ice
against
nick
carter
good
heavens
what
possessed
me
to
do
such
a
thing
not
the
question
said
oakley
a
bit
sullenly
now
have
confessed
the
whole
business
barring
the
outcome
only
the
devil
himself
can
explain
that
the
question
is
what
became
of
the
body
nick
carter
heard
the
last
with
no
great
surprise
it
was
in
line
with
his
earlier
suspicions
he
saw
too
with
what
consternation
doctor
dabney
and
the
other
students
began
to
realize
what
had
been
done
the
night
before
and
he
checked
with
a
gesture
the
censure
that
was
rising
to
the
lips
of
the
astounded
physician
hold
your
horses
doctor
dabney
and
let
me
handle
the
ribbons
he
said
impressively
reputation
of
your
college
is
at
stake
and
i
am
much
better
able
to
save
it
than
you
providing
the
remorse
of
these
young
men
is
genuine
and
they
follow
my
advice
the
good
name
of
your
institution
should
not
be
ruined
by
the
foolishness
of
a
few
of
your
students
if
it
can
possibly
be
prevented
i
think
they
now
will
see
it
in
the
same
light
and
do
all
in
their
power
to
rectify
their
folly
what
do
you
say
oakley
oakley
threw
up
his
hands
and
met
the
detective
better
than
halfway
say
that
all
wool
and
a
yard
wide
carter
he
cried
with
genuine
feeling
speak
for
the
others
and
tell
you
the
whole
story
not
only
that
sir
but
do
all
we
can
to
repair
the
like
a
man
nick
replied
learned
long
ago
that
a
manly
man
can
be
brought
out
with
proper
handling
what
is
the
whole
story
oakley
can
be
told
with
a
breath
carter
and
hand
it
to
you
straight
said
oakley
were
out
late
last
night
i
and
these
three
companions
and
we
drank
a
bit
more
than
we
should
have
done
when
wine
goes
in
wisdom
and
discretion
go
out
sir
and
that
was
the
beginning
of
oakley
said
nick
sir
we
came
to
place
along
about
one
and
we
saw
that
a
corpse
had
been
taken
in
there
we
learned
from
a
chap
who
had
overheard
the
facts
that
it
was
the
corpse
of
a
notorious
criminal
and
that
it
was
to
remain
in
place
till
this
morning
instead
of
being
sent
to
the
was
sir
in
the
heat
of
wine
i
suggested
to
my
companions
that
we
ought
to
have
that
brain
for
examination
in
the
interests
of
medical
science
and
the
possible
benefit
to
society
it
was
a
mad
suggestion
but
not
too
mad
for
my
companions
we
were
just
right
to
do
what
if
in
our
sober
senses
we
would
not
have
done
for
the
brief
oakley
you
went
there
and
stole
the
body
said
nick
just
what
we
did
sir
and
precisely
as
you
have
stated
oakley
admitted
came
here
and
quietly
got
out
the
wagon
also
a
short
ladder
with
which
to
reach
the
back
window
which
we
had
located
before
going
away
we
brought
the
body
here
about
four
this
morning
we
did
not
dare
to
leave
it
in
the
box
however
which
we
had
taken
from
the
room
you
have
just
inspected
we
replaced
the
box
in
the
room
but
hid
the
body
in
the
basement
under
the
dissecting
then
was
about
four
already
had
begun
to
realize
of
course
the
gravity
of
the
crime
we
had
committed
oakley
proceeded
went
to
my
apartments
in
the
street
below
but
not
to
go
to
bed
for
we
were
much
too
nervous
to
sleep
we
held
a
long
discussion
of
the
matter
and
the
situation
in
which
we
had
placed
ourselves
and
we
finally
determined
to
replace
the
corpse
in
the
wagon
and
to
return
it
to
place
making
a
frank
confession
of
our
guilt
and
relying
upon
his
mercy
but
we
found
upon
returning
to
the
basement
that
we
could
not
do
not
oakley
sir
cried
oakley
with
augmented
feeling
was
impossible
for
us
to
do
so
imagine
our
surprise
our
consternation
our
utterly
inexpressible
mean
mean
sir
that
the
body
was
true
carter
groaned
another
of
the
culprits
word
of
it
is
true
as
gospel
the
corpse
had
vanished
as
if
the
earth
had
swallowed
it
we
searched
in
vain
good
heavens
what
a
mess
i
thought
sir
i
was
going
nick
carter
was
less
surprised
than
the
other
hearers
he
had
begun
to
suspect
what
had
really
occurred
and
how
it
was
possible
he
paused
to
briefly
consider
the
matter
from
every
standpoint
aiming
to
act
for
the
best
while
doctor
david
dabney
relieved
his
feelings
in
terms
that
would
read
even
worse
than
they
sounded
and
while
the
half
score
of
students
who
had
gathered
near
by
stared
in
mute
amazement
over
the
bewildering
affair
nick
presently
took
the
ribbons
again
however
saying
with
an
impressiveness
that
never
failed
to
prove
effective
is
nothing
in
harsh
words
doctor
dabney
at
this
stage
of
the
game
we
must
meet
the
situation
in
the
best
way
and
attempt
to
remedy
it
without
too
much
publicity
i
am
not
going
to
arrest
these
young
men
at
present
nor
later
if
it
can
be
for
you
sir
cried
oakley
gratefully
shall
bind
them
on
their
honor
to
remain
here
as
usual
and
these
other
students
as
well
as
yourself
to
say
nothing
about
this
matter
nick
added
your
silence
and
theirs
may
depend
the
effect
of
all
this
upon
your
institution
i
happen
to
know
all
about
the
criminal
whose
body
seems
to
have
disappeared
so
mysteriously
and
the
recovery
of
which
is
of
much
more
importance
to
me
as
well
as
to
the
community
than
the
immediate
censure
and
punishment
of
these
four
students
you
must
do
what
i
have
directed
therefore
while
i
shall
take
immediate
steps
to
trace
the
missing
consideration
and
advice
had
the
effect
he
anticipated
doctor
dabney
subdued
his
anger
and
eagerly
seized
the
opportunity
to
avoid
publicity
the
relief
of
the
four
culprits
was
beyond
description
and
one
and
all
who
were
present
pledged
themselves
to
strictly
follow
the
instructions
thus
the
matter
was
adjusted
temporarily
at
least
and
nick
then
turned
to
oakley
and
said
me
to
the
basement
now
and
show
me
where
you
left
the
body
in
the
meantime
doctor
dabney
that
there
may
appear
to
be
nothing
unusual
going
on
here
have
all
of
your
other
students
attend
the
lecture
you
had
planned
to
deliver
there
is
in
fact
no
occasion
to
postpone
it
i
will
undertake
with
my
two
assistants
to
do
all
that
the
case
now
requires
lead
the
way
oakley
that
no
time
may
be
the
last
was
said
with
a
significant
glance
at
chick
and
patsy
and
the
three
detectives
followed
oakley
toward
the
basement
door
while
doctor
dabney
and
the
gathering
students
trooped
toward
the
entrance
to
the
annex
in
accord
with
nick
instructions
happen
to
have
a
key
that
will
open
this
door
carter
or
we
must
have
found
some
other
hiding
place
for
the
body
oakley
explained
while
unlocking
the
basement
door
it
was
discovered
and
removed
by
others
well
sir
that
beats
me
to
a
frazzle
i
was
literally
knocked
stiff
when
i
found
it
you
detected
any
sign
of
life
oakley
while
handling
it
nick
inquired
infer
of
course
that
you
had
the
slightest
carter
said
oakley
with
a
look
of
surprise
surely
do
not
suspect
mind
what
i
suspect
nick
interrupted
while
descending
to
the
basement
me
just
where
you
placed
the
oakley
led
the
way
to
a
corner
back
of
some
coal
bins
and
pointed
to
the
floor
left
it
there
sir
he
said
simply
a
covering
over
it
sir
the
sheet
brought
from
else
you
lock
the
door
after
going
out
with
your
companions
was
not
necessary
oakley
explained
has
an
automatic
spring
lock
like
many
of
the
doors
in
this
building
which
can
be
opened
from
within
though
a
key
is
required
by
one
entering
from
outside
they
were
equipped
with
locks
of
that
kind
because
students
frequently
are
the
last
to
leave
the
building
and
it
obviated
providing
keys
for
see
nick
remarked
can
leave
this
basement
without
a
key
then
sir
nick
took
out
his
electric
searchlight
and
began
a
close
inspection
of
the
cement
floor
it
was
covered
with
a
thin
almost
imperceptible
layer
of
dust
mingled
with
which
were
particles
of
coal
dust
quite
plainly
visible
with
the
aid
of
a
powerful
lens
have
given
it
to
me
straight
oakley
all
right
nick
remarked
after
a
moment
looking
up
lens
shows
where
the
dust
has
been
disturbed
and
i
can
determine
part
of
the
outline
of
the
body
there
appears
to
have
been
considerable
moving
about
however
either
by
not
by
the
body
oakley
exclaimed
staring
be
so
sure
of
that
nick
said
dryly
always
what
they
seem
we
may
find
that
ah
i
find
it
even
sooner
than
i
expected
here
is
one
yes
a
second
and
third
this
tells
the
is

cried
oakley
impulsively
a
look
chick
said
nick
my
chick
hastened
to
comply
viewing
one
of
several
faint
bits
of
evidence
on
the
dusty
floor
is
it
oakley
repeated
quivering
with
excitement
chick
looked
up
and
replied
a
faint
print
in
the
dust
the
print
of
a
naked
chapter
where
the
trail
led
your
surprise
this
is
no
more
than
i
was
expecting
to
find
said
nick
carter
glancing
at
amazed
face
have
picked
up
a
trail
which
i
felt
sure
i
must
seek
sooner
or
later
and
to
find
where
it
leads
now
is
of
paramount
right
chief
for
fair
said
patsy

need
you
no
longer
oakley
nick
added
had
better
join
the
other
students
at
the
lecture
i
will
do
what
i
can
to
pull
you
fellows
out
of
this
scrape
but
much
will
depend
upon
what
already
has
been
published
and
upon
my
success
in
finding
the
missing
man
no
no
demur
over
going
nor
stop
to
thank
me
time
now
is
of
double
value
go
at
oakley
appeared
anxious
to
remain
to
follow
farther
the
investigations
but
the
expression
in
eyes
warned
him
against
objecting
and
he
turned
with
a
nod
and
a
mere
word
of
thanks
and
hurried
from
the
basement
jove
this
is
a
most
extraordinary
case
chick
then
said
a
bit
grimly
you
now
any
doubt
nick
that
margate
still
is
alive
the
slightest
nick
replied
have
felt
from
the
first
that
that
was
the
how
could
he
have
accomplished
the
circumstances
admit
of
only
one
explanation
nick
interposed
had
when
we
cornered
him
some
kind
of
a
drug
or
compound
which
when
swallowed
instantly
produced
a
physical
condition
so
closely
resembling
death
that
it
deceived
not
only
us
but
also
doctor
nolan
and
the
did
condition
which
was
probably
a
form
of
catalepsy
evidently
lasts
a
definite
number
of
hours
depending
in
a
measure
upon
the
health
and
strength
of
the
subject
and
concerning
which
margate
must
have
been
perfectly
took
the
one
chance
that
if
supposed
to
be
dead
he
would
throw
off
the
effects
of
the
drug
and
revive
at
such
a
time
and
in
such
surroundings
as
would
permit
of
immediate
drug
evidently
ceased
to
be
effective
between
four
and
said
nick
would
have
served
him
admirably
if
he
had
remained
in
back
room
he
could
have
arisen
and
quietly
dressed
himself
his
garments
having
been
left
in
the
room
and
he
could
easily
have
made
his
chief
put
in
patsy
turning
over
in
job
done
by
the
students
however
put
him
in
bad
nick
added
must
have
revived
in
this
basement
in
a
building
in
which
he
probably
could
not
obtain
a
rag
of
clothing
aside
from
the
sheet
with
which
he
was
covered
immediate
flight
however
was
imperative
he
luckily
had
the
advantage
of
darkness
and
he
probably
fled
at
once
wrapped
only
in
the
sheet
his
first
move
of
course
was
to
find
garments
by
some
hook
or
crook
and
in
some
near
quarter
and
i
think
we
can
learn
where
he
got
did
not
break
into
house
nor
the
rooms
of
any
of
the
students
or
the
fact
would
have
been
reported
said
chick
would
have
been
less
likely
to
do
that
chick
than
to
have
sought
some
near
residence
occupied
by
fewer
persons
and
presenting
less
danger
of
detection
and
will
try
with
patsy
to
follow
up
the
trail
said
nick
turning
to
the
door
go
to
doctor
office
in
the
meantime
and
get
the
vial
still
containing
some
of
the
drug
or
compound
used
by
margate
take
it
to
professor
george
arden
whose
address
you
will
find
in
the
directory
he
is
one
of
the
leading
chemists
in
the
country
and
he
probably
will
be
able
to
tell
us
of
what
the
stuff
likely
chick
agreed
will
i
see
you
later
the
willard
we
will
return
about
noon
for
good
be
there
chick
nodded
turning
to
go
they
had
emerged
from
the
basement
while
speaking
and
nick
and
patsy
now
began
seeking
the
trail
of
the
missing
man
neither
in
the
driveway
nor
on
the
surrounding
lawns
could
they
discover
any
sign
of
a
bare
footprint
however
and
nick
paused
after
a
few
moments
and
said
must
use
our
heads
and
determine
what
direction
he
naturally
would
have
taken
he
would
not
have
ventured
to
the
lighted
streets
he
would
have
known
he
might
be
seen
and
would
have
been
very
probable
chief
for
fair
said
patsy
may
have
crossed
the
rear
grounds
therefore
and
perhaps
saw
that
house
which
fronts
on
the
avenue
the
roof
could
have
been
seen
above
the
trees
even
in
the
right
go
that
way
patsy
and
see
what
we
can
learn
keep
your
eyes
open
for
you
said
patsy
sententiously
it
took
them
only
a
few
minutes
to
cross
the
dabney
grounds
when
they
brought
up
at
a
low
wall
flanking
the
rear
of
the
estate
nick
had
noticed
when
he
first
arrived
in
that
locality
it
now
struck
him
even
more
familiarly
though
he
never
had
seen
the
rear
grounds
nor
that
side
of
the
imposing
wooden
residence
on
he
said
leaping
over
the
wall
direct
course
if
margate
had
his
head
and
really
came
this
way
would
have
been
around
the
garage
and
across
the
side
chief
if
he
was
heading
for
the
house
said
patsy
dwelling
is
where
he
most
likely
would
have
sought
clothing
nick
replied
knave
as
desperate
as
he
and
as
sorely
in
need
of
garments
would
not
have
shrunk
from
breaking
in
and
half
a
minute
chief
patsy
now
cried
interrupting
right
the
print
of
a
bare
patsy
had
discovered
it
in
some
loose
earth
near
the
garage
and
hastened
to
inspect
it
there
was
no
mistaking
it
for
it
was
distinctly
outlined
in
the
damp
soil
and
it
showed
plainly
in
which
direction
the
man
was
going
was
heading
for
the
house
chief
just
as
you
have
suspected
patsy
added
turning
to
look
for
another
was
sure
he
would
seek
some
dwelling
nick
replied
one
was
the
only
question
it
naturally
would
be
the
one
most
safely
and
quickly
approached
and
that
was
why
i
came
this
way
inquire
whether
anything
has
been
stolen
or
hello
some
one
is
calling
my
name
by
jove
senator
barclay
that
explains
it
i
thought
i
recognized
this
place
though
i
have
called
here
only
some
excited
chief
said
patsy
guess
you
have
hit
the
nail
on
the
head
all
senator
barclay
who
had
emerged
from
a
side
door
of
the
house
had
been
hurrying
toward
them
while
they
were
speaking
he
was
hatless
and
wore
a
loose
velvet
smoking
jacket
and
he
looked
pale
and
excited
indeed
in
the
morning
sunlight
saw
you
from
the
library
window
nick
he
cried
upon
drawing
nearer
brought
you
here
been
trying
vainly
to
get
you
by
telephone
i
was
told
that
you
left
the
willard
before
i
did
nick
replied
shaking
hands
with
him
was
called
out
on
a
rather
curious
case
but
what
do
you
want
of
me
senator
barclay
and
why
are
you
so
disturbed
he
added
tentatively
have
cause
to
be
disturbed
most
serious
cause
senator
barclay
answered
with
an
effort
to
govern
his
feelings
will
tell
you
of
that
a
little
later
my
house
has
been
robbed
a
most
amazing
amazing
senator
for
yourself
every
piece
of
my
clothing
removed
when
i
went
to
bed
last
night
was
carried
away
by
the
thief
shoes
stockings
underwear
shirt
and
outside
garments
not
a
piece
was
left
behind
by
the
rascal
why
he
took
such
articles
is
more
than
i
can
fathom
why
he
moment
nick
interposed
with
a
furtive
glance
at
patsy
he
take
anything
else
of
value
should
say
he
did
senator
barclay
cried
impetuously
pocketbook
containing
several
hundred
dollars
my
diamond
pin
worth
nearly
a
thousand
my
watch
and
chain
all
of
them
went
with
the
i
content
with
them
moreover
the
rascal
robbed
the
sleeping
room
of
my
daughter
estella
and
got
away
with
considerable
money
and
a
quantity
of
costly
jewelry
which
unfortunately
had
not
been
put
in
the
library
loss
will
aggregate
then
thousand
dollars
at
least
as
far
as
the
plunder
goes
but
that
is
nothing
absolutely
nothing
nick
compared
with
the
loss
of
one
other
article
senator
barclay
said
with
a
groan
other
article
nick
echoed
gazing
at
his
white
face
is
that
can
not
tell
you
not
here
was
the
reply
must
talk
with
you
privately
come
to
the
house
stella
is
nearly
prostrated
but
she
does
not
dream
of
my
distress
and
anxiety
i
have
hidden
the
truth
from
her
even
and
can
confide
only
in
you
nick
for
you
are
the
one
man
on
whom
i
can
depend
who
may
be
able
to
successfully
meet
the
situation
come
to
the
house
i
then
will
inform
well
nick
consented
understand
now
why
you
were
so
anxious
to
reach
was
more
than
anxious
more
than
anxious
senator
barclay
repeated
while
nick
and
patsy
accompanied
him
toward
the
house
is
another
mysterious
feature
in
connection
with
this
robbery
nick
one
that
seems
utterly
is
that
nick
inquired
thief
or
thieves
as
the
case
may
be
left
a
soiled
sheet
in
the
pantry
which
they
entered
by
breaking
the
window
and
unlocking
it
the
pantry
is
so
shut
in
that
the
noise
was
not
heard
the
robbery
was
not
discovered
until
estella
awoke
early
this
morning
and
found
that
her
room
had
been
entered
why
the
burglars
had
a
soiled
sheet
which
looks
as
if
it
had
been
through
a
war
puzzled
me
even
more
than
does
not
puzzle
me
senator
barclay
nick
interposed
the
statesman
gazed
at
nick
with
a
look
of
amazement
at
all
nick
added
was
only
one
burglar
senator
and
i
happen
to
know
why
he
had
a
soiled
heavens
is
it
possible
senator
barclay
replied
with
countenance
beginning
to
brighten
are
hundreds
of
brilliant
and
discerning
men
in
the
circle
of
my
acquaintance
carter
but
you
certainly
have
something
on
all
of
them
what
do
you
mean
how
do
you
know
there
was
only
one
burglar
and
why
he
left
a
soiled
sheet
in
my
house
by
gracious
i
begin
to
feel
that
you
may
yet
avert
the
calamity
that
threatens
wait
until
we
are
seated
in
our
library
senator
nick
replied
smiling
then
will
answer
your
questions
and
learn
what
you
require
of
me
it
goes
without
saying
of
course
that
i
will
do
all
in
my
power
to
avert
any
calamity
that
threatens
chapter
vi
a
threatening
situation
nick
carter
did
not
visit
the
pantry
to
examine
the
broken
window
nor
did
he
care
to
inspect
the
soiled
sheet
left
there
by
andy
margate
who
had
provided
for
him
with
unexpected
outside
help
one
of
the
strangest
cases
in
the
career
of
the
celebrated
detective
nick
already
had
formed
a
correct
theory
in
regard
to
the
burglary
he
now
wanted
to
learn
only
what
gave
senator
barclay
so
much
more
anxiety
and
distress
than
his
pecuniary
loss
nick
accompanied
him
into
the
library
therefore
leaving
patsy
to
wait
in
the
reception
room
and
he
began
with
informing
the
statesman
of
the
circumstances
which
beyond
any
reasonable
doubt
explained
the
crime
committed
in
his
residence
early
that
morning
heavens
senator
barclay
exclaimed
after
hearing
statements
we
never
to
be
rid
of
this
man
margate
i
never
heard
of
such
a
case
if
he
mind
him
senator
barclay
nick
interposed
will
put
him
away
for
keeps
sooner
or
well
i
hope
me
without
delay
for
time
may
be
valuable
how
you
are
threatened
with
something
more
serious
than
the
loss
of
your
money
and
is
infinitely
more
serious
carter
for
it
not
only
involves
a
matter
of
international
importance
but
also
the
reputation
welfare
and
social
standing
of
a
very
prominent
and
very
beautiful
woman
said
senator
barclay
in
tones
tremulous
again
with
profound
feeling
so
nick
inquired
something
else
stolen
in
the
pocket
of
the
coat
stolen
by
margate
was
a
document
confided
to
me
temporarily
by
the
woman
in
i
it
in
the
pocket
moreover
was
a
letter
written
to
me
by
the
woman
when
she
sent
me
the
document
for
inspection
senator
barclay
continued
received
it
only
early
last
evening
i
was
to
have
returned
it
this
morning
it
was
most
important
that
i
should
have
done
so
the
gravity
of
the
situation
carter
can
hardly
be
of
the
nature
of
the
document
nick
questioned
is
one
reason
was
the
reply
document
relates
to
a
secret
compact
between
several
european
powers
and
in
a
measure
has
a
bearing
upon
their
relations
with
this
see
nick
nodded
bears
the
signatures
of
no
less
than
five
foreign
ambassadors
now
in
washington
all
of
whom
are
pledged
to
secrecy
in
regard
to
the
matter
none
would
believe
for
a
moment
that
this
compact
is
even
suspected
by
any
american
statesman
or
diplomat
and
much
less
that
the
existence
of
the
document
mentioned
is
positively
follow
discovery
of
the
fact
might
precipitate
complications
of
a
very
grave
and
threatening
nature
senator
barclay
added
can
safely
assert
however
that
i
am
the
only
american
who
with
one
exception
knows
anything
about
the
document
aside
from
the
knave
into
whose
hands
it
has
me
know
the
exact
facts
said
nick
is
the
one
exception
who
knows
about
the
document
woman
i
have
did
you
learn
about
it
woman
informed
did
she
become
informed
senator
barclay
hesitated
for
a
moment
gazing
intently
at
the
earnest
face
of
the
famous
detective
am
going
to
confide
in
you
nick
as
i
would
in
no
other
man
on
earth
he
said
impressively
woman
whose
name
i
will
presently
mention
is
the
wife
of
one
of
the
european
ambassadors
whose
signatures
are
on
the
document
he
is
without
exception
the
most
influential
and
illustrious
diplomat
now
in
this
must
refer
then
to
sir
edward
have
met
him
said
nick
was
married
here
only
a
year
ago
his
wife
who
is
many
years
younger
than
he
was
a
wealthy
american
which
said
senator
barclay
evolved
the
terrible
situation
in
which
we
now
are
and
lady
deland
said
nick
quite
get
senator
barclay
proceeded
to
do
so
drawing
forward
in
his
chair
he
said
even
more
gravely
like
ten
days
ago
nick
for
no
other
reason
than
that
i
had
apprehended
something
of
the
kind
i
began
to
suspect
the
of
the
secret
compact
mentioned
and
that
a
document
to
that
effect
already
existed
naturally
of
course
i
knew
that
sir
edward
deland
would
be
one
of
the
chief
figures
in
likely
of
course
bowed
nick
had
occasion
three
days
ago
to
visit
the
deland
residence
in
company
with
my
daughter
who
long
has
been
an
intimate
friend
of
lady
deland
i
found
an
opportunity
to
hint
to
the
latter
that
she
perhaps
knew
something
of
the
matter
i
had
on
my
mind
and
that
it
would
become
a
american
girl
to
confidentially
inform
me
of
anything
that
might
possibly
be
a
menace
to
our
see
nick
remarked
suppressing
an
inclination
to
criticize
did
she
say
to
that
to
my
surprise
though
i
have
always
been
very
friendly
with
lady
deland
and
her
parents
a
fact
which
perhaps
led
me
to
make
such
a
suggestion
to
her
somewhat
to
my
surprise
i
repeat
she
immediately
admitted
that
such
a
compact
had
been
made
that
she
had
overheard
her
husband
discussing
it
with
other
diplomats
and
that
the
document
bearing
upon
the
matter
then
was
in
the
library
followed
deland
hastened
to
add
that
the
compact
of
the
nature
of
which
she
was
partly
informed
was
in
no
sense
a
menace
to
this
country
senator
barclay
continued
told
her
i
could
not
believe
that
and
that
she
really
must
be
mistaken
we
discussed
the
matter
very
earnestly
for
some
time
and
she
then
declared
with
much
feeling
that
the
very
best
service
she
could
do
me
and
her
country
would
be
to
let
me
read
the
document
in
order
to
convince
me
of
my
error
and
so
avert
the
troubles
that
might
otherwise
result
from
was
hardly
loyal
to
her
husband
said
nick
deland
did
not
so
regard
it
replied
senator
barclay
argued
that
she
could
not
serve
him
better
than
to
dispel
my
suspicions
and
set
him
right
in
my
opinion
bear
in
mind
that
she
has
known
me
from
childhood
with
absolute
confidence
in
me
she
would
have
no
greater
faith
in
her
own
can
appreciate
that
senator
as
far
as
it
do
not
feel
that
it
was
quite
right
to
sanction
her
suggestion
senator
barclay
allowed
knew
in
fact
that
it
was
quite
wrong
i
reasoned
on
the
other
hand
however
that
it
would
be
of
vast
relief
and
advantage
to
me
to
positively
verify
her
assertions
the
temptation
was
one
i
really
could
not
allowed
her
to
show
you
the
document
said
nick
inquiringly
at
that
time
senator
barclay
replied
then
was
impossible
for
her
to
have
done
so
secretly
sir
edward
deland
was
at
home
talking
with
my
daughter
and
another
lady
in
the
you
alone
with
lady
deland
of
course
during
your
on
the
side
did
you
decide
to
do
deland
decided
for
me
she
said
that
sir
edward
was
going
to
new
york
yesterday
morning
for
two
or
three
days
also
that
she
knew
the
combination
of
the
safe
and
in
what
compartment
the
document
had
been
i
said
she
would
send
it
to
me
yesterday
evening
which
she
did
with
an
understanding
that
i
would
surely
return
it
to
her
this
morning
that
now
is
impossible
utterly
impossible
senator
barclay
added
with
increasing
agitation
i
soon
can
do
so
however
good
heavens
carter
think
of
the
position
in
which
we
are
placed
unless
the
document
can
be
recovered
and
returned
to
the
safe
before
sir
edward
deland
arrives
home
is
no
need
to
picture
the
situation
nick
interposed
is
about
as
bad
as
it
could
be
senator
for
you
and
lady
express
it
groaned
the
statesman
is
horrible
horrible
will
do
all
in
my
power
to
pull
you
out
of
the
affair
nick
assured
him
me
now
whether
the
document
is
of
the
nature
you
had
feared
is
this
secret
compact
in
any
way
a
menace
to
this
country
thank
god
it
is
not
senator
barclay
said
fervently
am
relieved
to
that
extent
at
that
really
is
involved
in
the
lost
document
then
is
the
exposure
that
threatens
you
and
lady
that
not
enough
enough
senator
barclay
and
then
some
nick
admitted
said
i
think
that
she
sent
you
a
letter
with
the
mail
indeed
both
were
brought
here
by
her
butler
hawley
who
was
entirety
ignorant
of
what
the
package
did
she
say
in
the
letter
a
few
lines
directing
me
to
take
the
utmost
care
of
the
document
and
reminding
me
of
the
terrible
consequences
in
event
of
its
would
be
quite
enough
for
any
knavish
person
into
whose
hands
it
might
fall
nick
said
with
grim
dryness
know
of
no
person
who
would
be
more
quick
to
take
advantage
of
it
than
andy
margate
did
lady
deland
sign
her
full
name
to
the
letter
you
communicated
with
her
this
morning
yet
groaned
senator
barclay
nervously
wringing
his
hands
have
been
trying
to
get
hold
of
you
how
can
i
tell
her
how
can
i
inform
her
carter
that
not
going
to
inform
her
senator
barclay
you
must
keep
perfectly
quiet
and
leave
this
matter
to
me
it
now
is
eleven
i
will
see
lady
deland
as
quickly
as
possible
write
me
a
letter
of
introduction
senator
and
be
off
at
what
do
you
intend
ask
me
what
i
intend
doing
nick
interrupted
know
myself
at
present
save
that
i
must
see
lady
deland
without
needless
senator
barclay
hastened
to
write
the
desired
note
saying
while
he
gave
it
to
the
detective
you
really
mean
nick
that
i
must
do
nothing
more
in
this
matter
nothing
until
you
have
heard
from
me
nick
said
impressively
now
know
positively
that
andy
margate
lives
and
out
to
get
him
in
getting
him
senator
barclay
i
shall
probably
get
the
letter
and
document
that
are
of
such
vast
importance
to
you
whether
it
can
be
done
in
time
to
avert
the
peril
that
threatens
you
and
lady
deland
remains
to
be
seen
it
certainly
can
not
be
accomplished
by
prolonging
this
discussion
i
must
hasten
to
see
lady
chapter
vii
suspicions
verified
chick
carter
following
the
instructions
nick
had
given
him
readily
obtained
from
doctor
nolan
the
vial
from
which
andy
margate
had
swallowed
most
of
the
supposed
poison
with
which
he
was
thought
to
have
committed
suicide
when
cornered
by
the
detectives
yet
which
evidently
had
resulted
in
the
extraordinary
case
brought
to
notice
early
the
following
morning
and
the
true
inwardness
of
which
he
had
been
so
quick
to
suspect
to
prove
it
however
despite
the
surrounding
circumstances
and
to
locate
and
corner
margate
again
to
say
nothing
of
doing
so
in
time
to
save
the
reputations
of
senator
barclay
and
the
impulsive
american
girl
who
had
put
herself
in
a
position
that
threatened
to
ruin
the
remaining
years
of
her
life
all
this
was
an
entirely
different
proposition
the
discernment
of
nick
carter
nevertheless
as
well
as
the
wisdom
of
the
course
he
had
shaped
appeared
in
part
in
the
visit
of
chick
carter
to
the
laboratory
of
the
eminent
washington
chemist
and
in
what
immediately
followed
his
departure
it
was
nearly
noon
when
chick
introduced
himself
to
professor
arden
and
stated
his
mission
he
met
with
a
cordial
reception
and
the
chemist
soon
began
an
examination
of
the
small
quantity
of
fluid
still
remaining
in
the
vial
chick
waited
in
an
adjoining
room
for
more
than
an
hour
most
of
this
time
was
passed
in
reading
a
magazine
found
on
the
table
ending
an
article
in
which
he
had
become
interested
chick
replaced
the
book
on
the
table
and
glanced
incidentially
through
one
of
the
screened
windows
overlooking
the
grounds
without
and
an
adjoining
side
street
a
man
who
was
passing
at
that
moment
caught
the
eye
and
his
sinister
appearance
and
somewhat
stealthy
movements
quickly
aroused
suspicions
he
was
a
slender
cheaply
clad
fellow
in
the
twenties
wearing
a
baggy
brown
suit
and
a
woolen
cap
the
latter
pulled
suggestively
low
over
his
brow
he
peered
from
under
it
while
passing
a
boxwood
hedge
flanking
one
side
of
the
grounds
and
once
he
paused
nearly
back
of
a
clump
of
shrubbery
to
gaze
intently
toward
the
laboratory
windows
though
the
wire
screen
prevented
any
view
of
the
interior
jove
he
is
sizing
up
this
place
thought
chick
after
intently
watching
the
fellow
his
motive
if
it
corresponds
with
his
looks
by
gracious
sinister
enough
what
motive
can
he
have
in
which
i
do
not
figure
since
he
appears
to
have
turned
up
since
i
arrived
here
if
right
and
stake
a
trifle
on
it
that
fellow
is
a
rat
that
needs
the
man
had
moved
on
crossing
the
side
street
and
turning
an
opposite
corner
he
scarce
had
turned
it
however
when
chick
still
watching
saw
his
head
thrust
cautiously
around
the
corner
building
it
was
obvious
too
that
his
ratty
eyes
were
directed
toward
the
taxicab
in
front
of
the
residence
that
in
which
chick
had
come
there
and
for
whom
the
chauffeur
was
waiting
presently
the
head
vanished
but
not
the
suspicions
when
professor
arden
rejoined
chick
a
few
moments
later
he
returned
the
nearly
empty
vial
saying
with
a
smile
have
retained
enough
of
the
fluid
to
make
a
thorough
analysis
or
tests
that
may
possibly
reveal
its
precise
nature
and
properties
i
was
inclined
to
doubt
carter
the
existence
of
any
substance
or
compound
that
would
have
upon
the
human
organism
just
such
effects
as
you
have
described
in
the
case
of
professor
nick
feels
very
sure
he
is
right
said
chick
now
think
he
may
be
replied
the
chemist
have
been
experimenting
with
a
guinea
pig
using
a
minute
quantity
of
the
fluid
and
the
effect
upon
the
animal
is
very
similar
he
fell
almost
instantly
into
a
rigid
state
and
appeared
to
be
was
precisely
the
case
with
i
was
applying
other
tests
to
a
drop
of
the
fluid
however
which
required
most
of
the
time
i
have
been
absent
the
animal
began
to
soon
probably
because
of
the
small
quantity
of
fluid
used
chick
suggested
think
so
professor
arden
agreed
am
more
inclined
now
to
credit
your
suspicions
concerning
margate
i
can
not
definitely
determine
the
ingredients
of
the
fluid
at
this
time
however
and
i
may
not
be
able
to
do
so
at
all
i
will
try
later
nevertheless
and
will
advise
you
by
will
give
you
home
address
said
chick
producing
a
card
mighty
strange
and
powerful
stuff
all
right
whatever
it
may
have
heard
no
doubt
of
the
poisons
of
exili
professor
arden
replied
was
a
notorious
criminal
of
the
seventeenth
century
who
knew
the
art
of
making
the
most
subtle
and
deadly
poisons
as
well
as
compounds
which
are
said
to
have
had
very
similar
effects
upon
persons
as
those
you
have
described
some
of
the
formulas
of
exili
are
said
to
have
been
handed
down
through
generations
to
the
present
day
moreover
the
secret
and
sinister
possessions
of
a
very
few
persons
it
is
not
impossible
that
was
the
source
of
this
fluid
used
by
am
well
informed
concerning
exili
and
his
poisons
said
chick
smiling
a
bit
grimly
had
a
very
extraordinary
and
sensational
case
about
three
years
ago
in
which
one
of
the
exili
poisons
figured
there
was
no
doubt
about
it
in
that
case
you
may
be
right
as
to
this
shall
hear
from
me
later
about
it
said
professor
arden
while
he
accepted
his
fee
and
accompanied
the
detective
to
the
door
chick
thanked
him
again
and
departed
the
man
in
a
baggy
brown
suit
had
not
reappeared
but
chick
still
had
him
in
mind
he
walked
briskly
out
to
the
taxicab
then
paused
briefly
and
said
to
the
chauffeur
any
man
spoken
to
you
while
waiting
my
instructions
chick
directed
apprehending
that
he
might
be
covertly
watched
straight
down
this
avenue
and
turn
the
first
corner
to
the
left
after
having
turned
it
to
a
point
out
of
view
from
here
stop
at
once
and
drop
me
then
drive
on
quickly
and
go
about
your
business
understand
that
take
a
very
long
chick
sprang
into
the
taxicab
and
without
looking
back
he
was
whirled
speedily
around
the
corner
a
block
from
the
residence
he
then
sprang
out
and
the
chauffeur
uttered
an
exclamation
of
surprise
he
did
not
recognize
his
passenger
chick
had
put
on
a
disguise
and
knocked
his
soft
felt
hat
into
an
entirely
different
shape
on
he
commanded
giving
the
chauffeur
a
bank
note
lively
and
forget
the
quick
you
grinned
the
driver
speeding
away
chick
returned
to
the
corner
and
peered
cautiously
around
it
the
man
in
baggy
brown
was
just
descending
the
steps
of
professor
residence
that
does
settle
it
thought
chick
wanted
to
know
who
had
called
on
the
chemist
and
he
went
to
inquire
probably
offering
some
plausible
reason
he
evidently
found
out
too
judging
from
the
celerity
with
which
he
is
departing
you
shall
also
find
young
man
that
there
are
longer
heads
than
the
seedy
young
man
then
was
hastening
down
the
avenue
in
direction
but
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
broad
thoroughfare
chick
stepped
into
the
side
entrance
of
a
near
store
and
watched
him
from
one
of
the
front
windows
the
suspect
stopped
short
on
the
opposite
corner
and
gazed
sharply
in
the
direction
the
taxicab
had
taken
it
then
had
disappeared
the
street
was
deserted
with
the
exception
of
a
solitary
nurse
girl
wheeling
a
baby
in
a
carriage
the
man
pushed
the
cap
from
over
his
brow
and
hurried
on
chick
left
the
store
a
moment
later
and
followed
him
his
quarry
turned
the
next
corner
east
and
soon
brought
up
at
a
trolley
line
running
out
of
the
city
at
a
stand
near
by
he
bought
two
newspapers
and
then
waited
on
the
corner
for
a
car
chick
noticed
in
which
direction
he
was
looking
for
it
to
approach
which
told
him
in
which
direction
the
man
intended
going
he
then
crossed
the
avenue
mingling
with
other
pedestrians
and
waited
on
the
next
corner
beyond
his
quarry
five
minutes
later
he
saw
the
man
board
an
open
car
taking
one
of
the
front
seats
and
chick
presently
seated
himself
on
a
rear
one
the
suspect
then
was
absorbed
in
one
of
his
newspapers
more
than
half
an
hour
had
passed
when
looking
up
he
quickly
folded
it
and
thrust
it
into
his
pocket
the
car
then
had
left
the
outskirts
of
the
city
far
behind
it
was
passing
through
a
rural
country
quite
thickly
wooded
in
sections
and
chick
could
see
in
the
near
distance
a
road
diverging
at
a
slight
angle
to
the
right
from
that
of
the
trolley
line
going
to
drop
off
at
that
road
he
said
to
himself
favorable
for
me
all
right
in
that
the
woods
and
shrubbery
will
afford
me
some
chick
had
rightly
interpreted
the
movements
for
the
latter
presently
signaled
the
conductor
and
alighted
from
the
car
at
the
juncture
of
two
roads
at
once
walking
briskly
up
that
to
the
right
chick
rode
on
about
thirty
yards
then
sprang
from
the
moving
car
and
stepped
quickly
toward
the
scrubby
trees
and
shrubbery
filling
the
apex
of
the
angle
formed
by
the
two
roads
flanking
the
opposite
side
of
that
which
the
car
was
following
scattered
dwellings
could
be
seen
in
the
distance
but
the
road
to
the
right
appeared
to
be
unsettled
somewhat
to
surprise
after
stealing
in
among
the
low
trees
to
a
point
enabling
him
to
see
the
latter
road
he
discovered
his
quarry
seated
on
a
rock
at
one
side
and
gazing
up
the
deserted
way
has
an
appointment
with
some
one
chick
reasoned
noting
the
expectant
expression
is
going
to
wait
and
up
to
me
to
do
the
same
also
to
crawl
near
enough
to
overhear
what
may
be
said
that
ought
to
be
easily
accomplished
if
i
can
avoid
snapping
a
the
suspect
had
unfolded
his
second
newspaper
and
was
beginning
to
read
it
chick
dropped
upon
his
hands
and
knees
and
crept
within
thirty
feet
of
the
man
then
settled
himself
in
a
thicket
that
effectively
concealed
him
though
through
the
twigs
and
foliage
he
could
plainly
see
the
waiting
man
he
could
see
too
that
he
was
much
amused
by
what
he
was
reading
and
chick
was
not
slow
in
suspecting
the
nature
of
it
twenty
minutes
passed
also
several
motor
cars
at
each
of
which
the
suspect
gazed
sharply
when
he
heard
it
approaching
he
sprang
up
at
length
hearing
and
seeing
another
and
chick
felt
a
thrill
of
satisfaction
when
an
inferior
runabout
containing
a
man
and
a
woman
came
to
a
stop
near
his
quarry
three
can
not
ride
away
in
that
trap
he
said
to
himself
can
keep
an
eye
on
one
of
them
at
even
before
a
word
came
from
one
of
them
moreover
confirming
his
immediate
suspicions
chick
had
sized
up
the
couple
in
the
car
the
woman
was
somewhat
showily
clad
about
thirty
years
old
and
quite
attractive
barring
her
rouged
cheeks
and
indications
of
dissipation
in
her
sharp
gray
eyes
her
companion
was
a
bearded
man
in
an
black
suit
with
a
frock
coat
and
with
a
gray
slouch
hat
on
his
head
the
instant
chick
saw
him
and
his
garments
he
was
sure
of
the
identity
despite
his
facial
disguise
himself
flashed
up
in
his
mind
margate
as
sure
as
a
foot
this
was
confirmed
almost
immediately
by
the
intercourse
that
began
as
soon
as
the
woman
who
was
driving
the
runabout
brought
it
to
a
stop
at
one
side
of
the
road
she
exclaimed
here
ahead
of
us
here
said
the
man
in
baggy
brown
been
waiting
twenty
what
have
you
learned
selig
margate
demanded
with
manifest
interest
keep
quiet
nance
and
let
me
do
the
selig
thought
chick
then
he
rightly
inferred
their
resemblance
too
this
woman
should
be
his
sister
nance
selig
eh
the
man
in
the
road
drew
nearer
the
car
replying
with
a
laugh
i
have
not
been
idle
andy
you
can
bet
on
that
in
right
in
one
way
but
wrong
in
eh
queried
margate
with
a
snarl
me
the
worst
first
wrong
in
what
way
carter
suspects
you
have
fooled
deuce
he
does
he
only
suspects
mind
you
tony
selig
quickly
added
sure
of
do
you
know
how
did
you
learn
that
watching
the
deland
house
until
nearly
noon
as
you
directed
and
seeing
no
one
show
up
i
started
out
here
to
report
as
i
was
passing
the
residence
of
professor
arden
the
chemist
i
saw
a
taxicab
waiting
in
front
of
it
i
suspected
right
off
the
reel
that
a
detective
on
your
case
might
be
there
you
know
for
what
andy
and
i
was
did
you
make
sure
of
it
watched
until
a
man
came
out
and
hurried
away
in
the
taxi
selig
explained
with
a
sly
grin
reckoned
from
your
description
that
he
was
chick
carter
i
made
sure
of
it
by
ringing
arden
to
his
door
and
asking
him
if
carter
had
been
there
he
was
a
fall
guy
andy
all
right
he
said
that
carter
had
just
left
margate
ejaculated
scowling
did
settle
it
i
feared
that
the
carters
were
on
to
the
they
only
suspect
tony
selig
repeated
are
sure
of
nothing
andy
nor
any
of
the
guns
except
that
the
stiff
was
stolen
there
is
no
clew
to
the
thieves
nor
any
doubt
of
its
having
been
a
genuine
stiff
as
you
can
see
from
this
newspaper
story
have
a
look
the
latest
margate
seized
the
newspaper
and
eagerly
read
the
story
mentioned
it
told
only
of
the
theft
of
the
supposed
corpse
from
back
room
of
the
ignorance
of
the
police
and
detectives
concerning
the
identity
of
the
perpetrators
of
the
outrage
and
of
the
deep
mystery
enshrouding
the
entire
gruesome
case
margate
read
it
aloud
for
the
benefit
of
nancy
selig
and
chick
heard
every
word
of
it
as
well
as
all
of
what
passed
between
the
three
crooks
was
right
by
jove
in
saying
nothing
about
our
discoveries
in
the
alley
he
said
to
himself
rascal
now
will
think
indeed
that
we
are
all
in
the
this
already
was
apparent
in
the
look
of
relief
that
had
arisen
to
bearded
face
he
banged
the
newspaper
with
his
fist
uttering
an
oath
and
exultantly
adding
right
selig
dead
right
the
infernal
dicks
know
nothing
definite
they
believe
i
was
dead
they
surely
believe
it
and
know
only
that
my
body
was
stolen
they
have
no
idea
who
stole
it
however
not
even
a
shadow
of
suspicion
or
the
reporters
would
have
got
wise
to
thing
you
know
andy
selig
nodded
a
safe
gamble
too
that
the
cursed
students
who
queered
my
game
will
keep
their
traps
closed
margate
forcibly
argued
not
dare
to
confess
even
though
mystified
by
its
disappearance
think
themselves
well
rid
of
the
body
a
cinch
that
the
carters
have
not
tracked
them
nor
more
than
suspect
the
truth
and
we
still
have
time
to
bleed
the
woman
out
of
a
big
wad
of
true
andy
if
we
waste
no
time
put
in
nance
selig
suggestively
you
are
nance
declared
margate
with
eyes
glowing
a
move
on
get
the
coin
drive
her
to
the
wall
home
with
you
tony
and
wait
till
i
return
be
gone
only
long
enough
to
put
nance
in
right
she
can
turn
the
trick
before
evening
in
the
meantime
tony
make
ready
to
receive
her
ladyship
and
her
boodle
home
with
you
tony
and
wait
till
i
show
the
runabout
guided
by
the
woman
was
moving
rapidly
away
before
the
last
was
said
shouted
over
his
shoulder
by
the
daring
and
designing
criminal
chick
carter
had
more
than
one
reason
for
lying
low
and
letting
the
rascal
go
chapter
viii
chick
mishap
knowing
nothing
about
the
discoveries
made
by
nick
carter
since
parting
from
him
at
the
medical
college
ignorant
as
to
the
identity
of
the
woman
mentioned
by
margate
but
knowing
at
least
that
the
rascal
was
engaged
in
another
felonious
scheme
said
to
reach
its
culmination
that
very
evening
and
that
he
might
accomplish
even
more
by
following
tony
selig
than
by
attempting
to
arrest
the
three
crooks
then
and
there
which
might
have
been
difficult
when
undertaken
these
were
chick
reasons
for
letting
margate
and
the
woman
depart
and
for
resuming
his
pursuit
of
tony
selig
the
latter
immediately
started
up
the
road
in
the
direction
from
which
margate
had
come
and
his
actions
plainly
denoted
that
he
had
no
thought
of
being
followed
chick
found
it
comparatively
easy
therefore
to
shadow
him
without
being
detected
he
followed
him
for
nearly
a
mile
through
the
woodland
road
passing
only
a
solitary
house
on
the
way
despite
that
the
road
appeared
to
be
one
that
was
frequently
traveled
by
motorists
twenty
minutes
brought
tony
selig
to
his
destination
it
proved
to
be
an
old
wooden
house
back
from
the
road
with
a
stable
and
outbuildings
in
the
rear
all
in
a
clearing
dotted
with
numerous
hencoops
and
countless
hens
and
chickens
which
denoted
from
what
the
occupants
of
the
inferior
place
derived
their
living
perhaps
in
connection
with
other
and
more
profitable
ventures
chick
stole
to
a
point
in
the
surrounding
woods
from
which
he
could
view
the
place
he
saw
two
men
and
a
large
rawboned
woman
emerge
from
the
back
door
toward
which
tony
had
turned
his
steps
and
all
four
then
sat
down
on
a
platform
outside
and
began
an
earnest
discussion
of
the
news
tony
selig
evidently
had
brought
them
chick
rightly
inferred
that
they
were
all
of
one
family
but
he
was
too
far
away
to
hear
what
passed
between
them
during
the
next
hour
he
continues
to
watch
them
until
four
however
when
margate
returned
alone
in
the
runabout
all
sprang
up
to
greet
him
to
which
he
put
a
speedy
end
by
saying
so
forcibly
that
chick
heard
him
distinctly
that
out
for
something
more
important
set
the
ball
rolling
and
nance
knows
just
what
to
do
up
to
us
to
do
the
rest
get
the
lanterns
zeke
you
and
angus
and
head
for
the
poplars
it
will
be
dark
in
an
hour
or
a
trifle
more
the
game
might
show
up
even
earlier
we
must
be
ready
for
her
get
the
documents
but
leave
the
other
plunder
here
be
ready
when
i
come
margate
hurried
into
the
house
with
the
last
not
waiting
for
an
answer
the
two
men
addressed
by
name
evidently
the
father
and
brother
of
tony
selig
hastened
to
the
stable
from
which
they
quickly
emerged
with
three
oil
lanterns
they
then
returned
to
the
house
from
which
the
woman
had
in
the
meantime
brought
their
coats
and
hats
jove
this
does
look
like
something
doing
thought
chick
stealing
into
a
thicket
some
fifty
yards
back
of
the
house
poplars
eh
i
wonder
where
that
is
or
they
if
it
refers
only
to
trees
come
pretty
near
finding
out
by
gracious
also
to
what
documents
that
rascal
refers
i
wonder
which
way
chick
had
not
long
to
wait
and
it
was
not
without
misgivings
that
he
saw
the
four
men
shape
a
course
through
the
woods
that
took
them
within
twenty
feet
of
his
concealment
they
passed
without
seeing
him
however
and
he
then
proceeded
to
cautiously
keep
them
in
view
a
tramp
of
half
a
mile
through
the
woods
brought
into
view
another
section
of
the
road
also
a
large
old
wooden
house
some
fifty
yards
from
the
highway
with
a
stable
and
a
long
open
shed
adjoining
it
the
whole
shut
in
somewhat
by
a
park
of
huge
old
poplars
from
which
the
house
evidently
derived
its
name
chick
saw
at
a
glance
nevertheless
that
the
house
was
unoccupied
the
curtains
or
blinds
of
most
of
the
windows
were
closely
drawn
the
stable
doors
were
closed
and
padlocked
while
the
ground
in
the
driveway
and
shed
was
running
to
rank
grass
the
character
of
the
place
also
was
apparent
and
it
afterward
appeared
that
it
had
been
closed
by
the
authorities
nearly
a
year
before
and
since
had
been
unoccupied
old
road
house
thought
chick
sizing
it
up
has
been
vacant
for
some
time
but
why
have
these
rascals
come
here
why
is
he
taking
a
chance
of
breaking
into
the
house
by
jove
i
think
i
have
margate
leading
the
way
was
skillfully
forcing
open
the
back
door
of
the
deserted
old
road
house
want
the
expected
interview
in
a
house
with
which
they
are
not
identified
yet
in
which
it
can
be
safely
held
chick
rightly
reasoned
isolated
old
place
just
serves
them
and
they
feel
sure
of
not
being
traced
from
it
i
reckon
that
be
necessary
by
jove
if
i
can
get
in
my
work
without
a
margate
had
led
the
way
into
the
house
followed
by
his
three
confederates
chick
could
see
that
they
had
left
the
door
ajar
however
and
it
was
obvious
that
not
one
of
them
feared
having
been
watched
for
not
a
curtain
stirred
at
any
of
the
windows
denoting
the
precaution
of
stealthily
looking
out
wait
a
few
minutes
and
then
take
a
chance
chick
muttered
can
slip
in
there
unheard
wager
i
can
thwart
any
knavery
they
have
up
their
sleeves
only
twenty
yards
from
the
end
of
the
open
shed
to
that
side
of
the
house
it
would
be
play
to
reach
the
back
door
from
that
the
sun
had
set
and
the
dusk
of
the
november
afternoon
was
beginning
to
gather
chick
looked
around
for
another
dwelling
or
signs
of
persons
traveling
the
road
but
none
met
his
searching
gaze
he
felt
that
he
must
tackle
the
task
and
that
a
step
taken
at
that
time
might
be
of
later
advantage
not
a
sound
came
from
within
the
house
nor
a
sign
of
the
men
who
had
entered
it
starting
abruptly
when
the
dusk
began
to
deepen
chick
crept
back
of
the
long
shed
quickly
picking
his
way
to
that
end
of
it
nearest
the
house
he
then
waited
and
listened
briefly
and
he
could
hear
the
intermittent
blows
of
a
hammer
does
settle
it
he
said
to
himself
evidently
are
busy
so
my
darting
quickly
to
the
back
steps
chick
crouched
and
listened
again
still
hearing
the
hammer
and
he
then
pushed
the
door
open
a
few
inches
the
dim
hall
was
deserted
it
ran
straight
through
the
house
to
the
front
door
chick
now
could
hear
the
four
men
in
one
of
the
side
rooms
he
stepped
noiselessly
into
the
hall
leaving
the
door
as
he
had
found
it
and
he
then
sought
concealment
on
a
bare
back
stairway
leading
to
the
second
floor
may
find
it
of
advantage
to
steal
up
there
he
said
to
himself
must
overhear
just
what
comes
off
in
this
crib
and
also
learn
how
many
i
am
finally
up
the
hammer
ceased
at
that
moment
and
he
heard
margate
say
gruffly
addressing
the
elder
selig
good
enough
zeke
good
strikes
me
so
not
a
ray
of
light
can
get
through
the
blankets
to
say
nothing
of
the
curtains
and
blinds
be
safe
enough
from
have
been
tacking
blankets
over
the
windows
thought
chick
the
lanterns
angus
margate
now
commanded
getting
infernally
dark
here
but
not
as
dark
as
i
found
it
last
night
nor
anything
like
as
cold
that
was
a
close
call
if
ever
a
man
had
call
is
right
andy
tony
selig
vouchsafed
the
meds
did
me
a
good
turn
at
that
margate
added
forced
me
into
seeking
other
garments
than
my
own
and
put
me
in
a
way
to
pull
off
this
job
clean
up
handsomely
from
the
whole
business
you
can
bank
on
that
and
be
no
clew
left
to
show
who
turned
the
trick
after
i
have
bolted
with
nance
for
south
be
bolted
in
other
quarters
you
rascal
unless
i
am
much
mistaken
thought
chick
still
on
the
stairway
jove
i
quite
fathom
this
the
conversation
that
followed
shed
a
ray
of
light
upon
it
but
only
a
ray
as
far
as
the
listening
detective
was
concerned
feel
sure
the
woman
will
pay
do
you
zeke
selig
inquired
you
bet
pay
said
margate
confidently
letter
to
barclay
shows
that
what
else
can
she
do
got
to
have
the
document
before
her
husband
shows
up
or
well
she
knows
what
the
finish
would
will
he
show
up
letter
say
it
says
only
that
she
must
have
the
document
i
would
nail
barclay
too
only
likely
to
call
on
nick
carter
for
aid
after
informing
the
woman
of
his
loss
take
a
chance
that
we
can
bleed
her
before
carter
gets
to
work
there
just
now
you
know
he
must
have
his
hands
full
looking
after
my
what
in
thunder
is
the
document
asked
tony
after
lighting
the
lanterns
can
not
just
make
it
out
replied
margate
a
foreign
agreement
of
some
kind
and
is
signed
by
a
bunch
of
diplomats
i
see
thought
chick
listening
intently
barclay
evidently
is
in
wrong
with
some
know
enough
however
to
be
sure
we
could
nail
no
one
else
for
anything
margate
added
woman
is
the
only
one
in
our
clutches
since
the
trick
must
be
turned
immediately
come
across
with
the
coin
all
right
and
may
show
up
here
with
nance
at
any
moment
fix
the
front
door
so
we
can
let
her
in
by
the
way
one
of
you
lock
and
bolt
the
back
both
zeke
and
angus
selig
started
to
do
so
striding
out
of
the
room
at
heels
and
all
three
appeared
almost
immediately
in
the
hall
then
lighted
by
the
rays
from
the
lanterns
chick
heard
them
coming
and
knew
that
he
must
be
seen
if
he
remained
on
the
stairway
about
half
of
which
he
had
ascended
he
drew
back
quickly
from
the
plain
wooden
rail
on
the
outer
side
intending
to
steal
quietly
up
to
the
second
floor
when
he
trod
on
the
next
bare
stair
however
the
projecting
edge
of
the
footboard
weakened
with
age
and
dampness
in
the
closed
house
broke
under
his
weight
chick
lost
his
footing
and
his
balance
he
fell
heavily
against
the
rail
seizing
it
to
prevent
falling
backward
down
the
stairs
the
startling
noise
brought
a
roar
from
margate
that
the
question
was
instantly
answered
but
not
verbally
the
stairway
rail
snapped
and
broke
under
the
weight
instead
of
falling
backward
down
the
stairway
chick
pitched
headlong
over
the
side
of
it
straight
down
six
feet
to
the
hall
floor
on
which
he
landed
with
a
crash
that
seemed
to
shake
the
house
the
three
men
saw
him
as
plainly
as
they
had
heard
him
and
another
roar
came
from
andy
margate
spy
one
of
the
carters
boys
or
a
liar
get
him
lend
me
a
chick
heard
them
though
severely
shaken
and
stunned
and
he
tried
to
rise
margate
leaped
upon
him
like
a
wolf
on
a
lamb
however
forcing
him
back
upon
the
floor
and
dealing
him
a
blow
on
the
head
at
the
same
time
shouting
with
a
gun
shoot
him
zeke
if
he
stirs
bring
a
rope
tony
and
be
quick
about
it
cut
one
of
the
window
chapter
ix
the
woman
involved
it
was
close
upon
noon
when
nick
carter
after
his
interview
with
senator
barclay
rejoined
patsy
garvan
and
hastened
from
the
residence
none
could
have
appreciated
more
keenly
the
gravity
of
the
situation
the
delicate
nature
of
what
had
been
confided
to
him
and
the
quick
and
clever
work
that
must
be
done
to
avert
the
impending
calamity
if
indeed
it
were
possible
nick
thought
he
already
saw
his
way
clearly
however
and
he
began
with
informing
patsy
of
as
many
of
the
circumstances
as
the
case
required
got
a
look
in
patsy
at
least
he
added
pausing
on
a
corner
to
hail
a
taxicab
margate
sizes
up
the
letter
and
document
as
i
think
he
will
he
may
undertake
to
blackmail
lady
deland
before
i
can
be
seen
by
senator
barclay
and
put
on
the
case
he
will
reason
of
course
that
i
can
not
have
yet
discovered
that
he
is
alive
much
less
have
tracked
him
to
the
medical
college
and
to
the
barclay
whiz
exclaimed
patsy
the
only
man
on
earth
chief
who
could
have
accomplished
all
that
in
so
short
a
time
margate
will
not
believe
it
am
banking
on
that
patsy
and
that
he
will
attempt
to
take
advantage
of
my
supposed
ignorance
he
will
know
too
that
any
move
to
blackmail
lady
deland
must
be
made
immediately
both
on
my
account
and
the
fact
that
the
document
must
be
restored
to
her
before
when
it
will
become
useless
as
a
lever
to
blackmail
see
both
points
chief
nodded
patsy
have
a
countermove
framed
up
in
my
mind
nick
added
that
chief
will
inform
you
a
little
later
you
go
to
the
willard
as
quickly
as
possible
now
and
bring
our
box
to
the
deland
residence
wearing
a
disguise
i
have
one
in
my
pocket
that
will
enable
me
to
go
there
without
being
recognized
assuming
that
the
house
is
being
watched
which
i
hardly
think
is
probable
take
no
chances
however
rejoin
me
there
as
soon
as
can
bank
on
that
chief
declared
patsy
as
he
turned
and
hurried
away
ten
minutes
later
and
precisely
ten
minutes
after
tony
selig
ceased
watching
the
deland
residence
nick
alighted
in
the
disguise
of
an
elderly
man
from
his
taxicab
and
rang
the
doorbell
of
the
imposing
stone
mansion
the
summons
was
answered
by
the
butler
hawley
to
whom
nick
said
tentatively
sir
edward
deland
at
home
sir
hawley
politely
informed
him
is
in
new
york
he
is
expected
here
deland
then
is
at
home
sir
i
will
take
in
your
card
sir
if
this
note
to
her
instead
and
say
that
i
would
like
to
see
her
immediately
nick
directed
interrupting
in
nick
had
waited
only
a
few
moments
in
the
reception
hall
when
the
butler
returned
and
conducted
him
to
the
library
where
he
found
lady
deland
awaiting
him
a
stately
beautiful
woman
still
in
the
twenties
whose
pale
cheeks
and
apprehensive
eyes
denoted
with
what
misgivings
she
had
read
senator
note
introducing
the
famous
detective
the
door
when
you
go
out
she
directed
with
a
glance
at
the
butler
your
hawley
bowed
himself
from
the
room
am
pleased
to
meet
you
carter
and
long
have
known
you
by
name
said
lady
deland
then
shaking
hands
with
the
detective
me
what
is
the
meaning
of
this
visit
has
anything
happened
to
sir
edward
deland
or
to
she
hesitated
turning
deathly
white
when
nick
removing
his
disguise
said
gravely
have
anticipated
what
has
happened
lady
know
she
gasped
barclay
was
forced
to
confide
in
my
god
the
woman
reeled
as
if
about
to
faint
and
nick
helped
her
to
a
chair
saying
quickly
not
be
alarmed
nothing
confided
to
me
lady
deland
ever
goes
farther
i
know
all
of
the
circumstances
and
appreciate
your
position
i
hope
to
accomplish
all
that
is
necessary
to
set
you
right
i
really
expect
to
do
so
in
fact
so
try
to
be
calm
and
give
me
your
assistance
both
are
imperative
to
what
i
have
in
encouraging
words
were
not
without
effect
upon
her
lady
deland
drew
up
in
her
chair
composing
herself
with
an
effort
and
replying
gratefully
you
thank
you
carter
but
oh
this
is
terrible
how
could
i
have
done
such
a
thing
tell
me
the
worst
let
me
know
the
nick
then
informed
her
as
briefly
as
possible
of
the
strange
combination
of
circumstances
resulting
in
the
loss
of
the
fateful
document
and
her
letter
relating
to
it
adding
with
convincing
earnestness
barclay
is
in
no
sense
to
blame
for
the
misfortune
he
thought
the
safest
place
for
the
document
during
the
single
night
he
was
to
retain
it
was
in
the
pocket
of
the
coat
in
his
own
i
do
not
blame
him
carter
said
lady
deland
who
now
had
nerved
herself
to
meet
the
trying
situation
barclay
is
a
very
dear
friend
and
a
man
in
whom
i
have
absolute
confidence
otherwise
i
never
could
have
taken
such
a
step
which
i
truly
felt
would
be
the
best
for
all
appreciate
that
i
assure
what
can
be
done
how
can
is
what
i
now
wish
to
discuss
with
you
lady
deland
and
to
point
out
what
i
require
of
you
nick
interposed
think
that
we
may
yet
thwart
andy
margate
and
recover
the
document
in
time
to
save
you
from
that
dreadful
man
he
must
know
mind
what
he
knows
about
it
nick
again
interrupted
i
can
land
him
and
recover
the
document
i
will
make
very
sure
that
neither
he
nor
any
of
his
confederates
will
afterward
reveal
anything
i
will
put
them
where
they
can
accomplish
nothing
besides
lady
deland
revelations
on
their
part
would
fall
flat
when
opposed
with
denials
from
persons
of
your
character
and
that
of
senator
what
can
be
done
carter
she
anxiously
inquired
nick
then
proceeded
to
tell
her
of
his
suspicions
of
the
only
way
by
which
advantage
of
the
document
would
probably
be
taken
and
that
it
must
be
attempted
that
very
day
in
order
to
be
effective
understand
she
bowed
after
hearing
him
is
only
one
way
by
which
it
could
be
done
lady
deland
and
only
one
method
that
really
appears
feasible
nick
continued
is
by
the
use
of
the
telephone
which
presents
too
many
difficulties
and
contingencies
for
me
to
think
that
method
will
be
the
other
other
is
with
a
personal
interview
with
you
possibly
by
margate
himself
though
much
more
probably
by
one
of
his
confederates
nick
continued
to
explain
a
daring
and
desperate
man
i
doubt
that
margate
will
venture
here
in
what
am
i
to
do
rascals
will
have
only
one
object
in
view
that
of
forcing
you
to
pay
them
a
large
sum
of
money
or
perhaps
turn
over
your
jewels
to
them
just
how
they
will
attempt
it
remains
to
be
seen
and
i
wish
to
be
in
a
position
to
direct
what
occurs
here
that
must
be
accomplished
without
incurring
the
suspicions
of
the
person
whom
margate
may
how
can
you
do
that
carter
lady
deland
doubtfully
inquired
will
be
necessary
for
me
to
see
the
true
nick
admitted
glancing
around
the
room
think
however
that
we
can
arrange
it
where
does
that
door
lead
he
added
pointing
to
one
across
which
a
porti√®re
was
partly
drawn
sir
private
study
said
lady
deland
there
another
door
leading
out
of
the
room
the
side
said
nick
with
manifest
satisfaction
where
you
sit
lady
deland
by
glancing
into
the
mirror
over
the
fireplace
i
think
you
can
see
into
the
sir
i
can
do
so
i
observe
by
merely
turning
your
eyes
in
the
direction
of
the
can
you
were
to
do
so
merely
casually
a
person
seated
here
would
have
no
idea
that
you
were
in
communication
with
a
person
in
the
study
said
nick
turning
my
chair
in
this
direction
i
can
see
the
mirror
but
not
the
study
door
nor
any
reflection
of
i
now
see
what
you
mean
lady
deland
exclaimed
wish
to
signal
me
from
the
study
by
means
of
the
mirror
while
i
am
talking
with
the
person
you
suspect
will
come
nick
replied
will
stand
so
that
you
can
see
a
reflection
of
me
and
i
will
signify
with
a
nod
or
with
a
negative
shake
of
my
head
what
course
you
must
understand
you
will
be
necessary
for
you
to
yield
to
whatever
design
may
be
you
any
idea
of
what
it
will
consist
think
you
will
be
required
to
go
somewhere
both
to
get
and
deliver
a
price
for
the
document
and
also
in
order
to
receive
the
will
go
said
lady
deland
quickly
shall
not
fear
i
would
dare
anything
carter
to
recover
more
will
be
necessary
nick
replied
wish
to
go
with
you
with
one
of
my
assistants
who
will
presently
arrive
will
that
be
allowed
must
fool
whoever
comes
here
into
allowing
it
smiled
nick
that
be
possible
think
so
in
view
of
the
fact
that
much
is
at
stake
and
that
there
is
no
time
for
other
arrangements
you
must
insist
upon
going
in
your
touring
car
and
taking
your
chauffeur
and
your
can
state
that
they
know
nothing
about
the
business
engaging
you
and
that
the
crooks
will
incur
no
danger
from
your
having
these
uninformed
companions
they
will
have
guarded
against
danger
all
right
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
know
such
rascals
root
and
i
understand
lady
deland
said
doubtfully
can
my
maid
and
chauffeur
accomplish
that
to
me
nick
replied
smiling
again
shall
be
your
chauffeur
lady
deland
and
your
maid
will
be
patsy
garvan
my
assistant
who
can
make
up
very
cleverly
as
a
girl
in
the
i
now
see
at
what
you
are
driving
cried
lady
deland
with
countenance
lighting
must
provide
him
with
the
necessary
garments
however
nick
added
have
all
else
that
will
be
will
do
so
also
wish
to
take
your
place
for
a
time
that
i
may
determine
whether
any
visitor
warrants
suspicion
and
also
take
steps
consistent
with
our
may
do
so
lady
deland
said
readily
will
give
you
all
the
assistance
in
my
will
make
all
of
the
necessary
arrangements
after
my
assistant
arrives
nick
rejoined
shall
want
a
coat
cap
and
gloves
belonging
to
your
chauffeur
we
will
put
them
in
an
adjoining
room
where
i
can
easily
and
quickly
get
them
i
will
wear
a
different
disguise
in
the
two
characters
i
shall
assume
and
ah
there
is
the
doorbell
that
should
be
patsy
in
half
an
hour
lady
deland
we
shall
have
completed
our
chapter
x
in
the
nick
of
time
it
was
after
two
that
afternoon
when
nancy
selig
following
instructions
received
from
andy
margate
rang
the
bell
at
the
deland
residence
and
prepared
with
all
the
nerve
and
effrontery
of
one
of
her
class
to
carry
out
the
coercive
design
of
her
knavish
confederate
a
butler
answered
the
bell
but
not
the
usual
butler
would
like
an
interview
with
lady
deland
said
nancy
bowing
and
smiling
with
affected
gentility
will
take
in
your
card
madame
nick
replied
with
blank
countenance
if
you
will
state
what
your
business
is
i
will
inform
her
of
your
does
not
know
me
by
name
nancy
coolly
announced
am
soliciting
contributions
to
a
very
worthy
cause
and
i
was
sent
here
by
a
friend
of
lady
deland
will
you
kindly
tell
her
so
and
say
she
added
quite
pointedly
she
may
hear
something
greatly
to
her
nick
carter
needed
to
hear
no
more
than
that
he
bowed
and
vanished
two
minutes
later
he
returned
saying
a
bit
stiffly
deland
will
see
thought
she
would
remarked
nancy
with
covert
dryness
nick
conducted
her
to
the
library
and
ushered
her
into
the
room
lady
deland
arose
to
receive
her
and
pointed
to
a
chair
nancy
selig
took
it
without
the
ghost
of
a
suspicion
nick
withdrew
and
closed
the
door
then
stepped
noiselessly
through
the
side
hall
and
into
the
study
the
first
words
that
fell
upon
his
ears
from
the
library
told
him
that
nancy
selig
had
lost
no
time
in
approaching
the
business
engaging
her
can
safely
admit
it
to
me
since
you
say
there
is
no
one
to
hear
us
she
was
adding
to
what
already
had
passed
between
them
is
nothing
in
mincing
matters
the
question
is
do
you
want
to
recover
it
that
you
really
know
what
you
have
stated
and
that
i
have
lost
such
an
article
as
you
suggest
i
naturally
would
be
anxious
to
recover
it
lady
deland
replied
just
one
way
you
can
do
it
said
nancy
is
that
paying
for
whom
are
you
the
person
who
has
it
a
man
has
it
who
him
here
then
lady
deland
interrupted
will
talk
with
be
a
fool
nancy
said
curtly
pretend
that
the
paper
is
of
no
great
value
to
you
we
know
better
than
that
we
who
have
it
you
listen
to
me
for
half
a
minute
and
tell
you
just
where
you
stand
and
what
you
must
lady
eyes
drifted
toward
the
mirror
for
an
instant
and
she
received
from
the
listening
detective
a
signal
of
assent
i
will
hear
you
she
replied
gazing
at
the
crafty
determined
face
of
her
visitor
what
nancy
selig
had
to
say
may
easily
be
imagined
and
she
wound
up
her
threatening
remarks
with
the
announcement
that
lady
deland
must
pay
ten
thousand
dollars
for
the
return
of
the
document
and
her
letter
to
senator
barclay
or
that
both
would
be
sent
to
her
husband
the
moment
he
returned
to
washington
lady
deland
played
her
part
consistently
now
and
then
receiving
a
signal
from
nick
and
evincing
apprehensions
that
soon
convinced
nancy
selig
of
her
own
ultimate
success
you
need
do
is
go
with
me
and
pay
down
the
money
she
announced
at
length
you
return
home
have
the
two
i
so
much
money
in
the
house
lady
deland
protested
it
from
the
bank
said
nance
curtly
still
is
am
i
to
go
with
you
a
house
a
few
miles
from
the
lady
deland
demurred
over
that
pretending
that
she
feared
to
do
so
and
she
wound
up
with
insisting
that
she
would
go
only
in
her
own
touring
car
in
company
with
her
maid
and
chauffeur
nancy
selig
objected
strongly
to
that
and
for
several
minutes
the
argument
between
the
two
women
continued
but
the
outlook
for
success
finally
overcame
objections
i
agree
to
that
then
she
said
with
a
threatening
frown
not
to
leave
me
or
have
any
talk
with
them
that
i
can
not
hear
ride
with
you
and
go
into
the
bank
with
you
not
stand
for
any
monkey
business
you
can
bet
on
will
be
no
monkey
business
whatever
that
is
said
lady
deland
coldly
your
maid
here
then
and
give
her
your
directions
snapped
nancy
for
the
chauffeur
too
so
we
can
make
a
quick
lady
deland
touched
a
bell
on
the
library
table
nick
entered
from
the
hall
half
a
minute
later
my
maid
hawley
said
lady
deland
nance
constantly
watching
her
your
ladyship
bowed
nick
another
half
minute
brought
patsy
garvan
into
the
room
so
cleverly
made
up
as
a
girl
as
to
have
deceived
the
most
discerning
observer
on
your
outside
garments
lucy
and
bring
mine
to
the
front
hall
said
lady
deland
madame
said
patsy
demurely
tell
hawley
to
send
james
to
the
front
door
with
the
touring
car
added
lady
deland
want
both
of
you
to
go
with
me
for
a
few
patsy
bowed
and
withdrew
nick
already
was
on
his
way
to
the
garage
lady
deland
opened
her
desk
in
the
library
and
removed
a
bank
book
woman
i
am
ready
she
said
coldly
she
was
not
more
ready
than
nancy
selig
who
now
felt
sure
that
she
was
not
being
tricked
five
minutes
later
the
touring
car
driven
by
nick
with
patsy
on
the
seat
beside
him
and
with
lady
deland
and
nance
in
the
tonneau
sped
away
from
the
house
and
turned
toward
the
business
section
of
the
city
nick
had
been
quietly
informed
as
to
the
bank
and
its
location
at
which
they
arrived
twenty
minutes
later
and
into
which
nancy
accompanied
lady
deland
leaving
the
supposed
chauffeur
and
maid
in
the
car
this
looks
like
soft
walking
chief
now
remarked
patsy
while
they
waited
so
nick
replied
think
we
shall
land
the
goods
and
arrest
the
gang
that
woman
even
the
ghost
of
a
nick
was
right
with
crafty
foresight
bent
upon
not
arriving
at
the
road
house
until
just
after
dark
nancy
selig
directed
the
supposed
chauffeur
over
a
roundabout
course
that
thus
served
her
purpose
it
was
between
five
and
six
when
the
light
from
the
touring
car
swerved
quickly
from
the
woodland
road
and
the
car
itself
ran
noiselessly
in
toward
the
shed
and
stable
back
of
the
road
house
nance
said
quietly
quickly
alighting
and
addressing
lady
deland
two
servants
stay
nick
carter
bowed
standing
at
the
door
he
had
alighted
to
open
lady
deland
started
to
get
out
of
the
car
then
came
a
crash
from
within
the
house
the
thud
of
a
fallen
body
and
then
the
fierce
and
furious
shouts
of
andy
margate
every
word
of
which
reached
the
ears
nick
turned
like
a
flash
and
seized
nancy
selig
by
the
throat
patsy
he
muttered
quick
chick
is
here
before
patsy
was
out
and
at
work
before
the
last
was
said
and
in
thirty
seconds
nancy
selig
was
lying
on
the
ground
manacled
hand
and
foot
lady
deland
was
nearly
fainting
but
neither
detective
noticed
her
both
rushed
to
the
back
door
still
ajar
and
showing
a
beam
of
light
nick
was
the
first
to
reach
and
open
it
dashing
into
the
hall
revolver
in
hand
he
saw
chick
on
the
floor
the
four
men
above
him
and
the
hand
of
andy
margate
raised
with
a
revolver
to
beat
out
the
fallen
brains
nick
fired
on
the
instant
and
the
bullet
went
true
margate
pitched
forward
in
a
heap
with
an
ounce
of
lead
in
his
brain
and
instant
consternation
and
dismay
fell
upon
his
three
confederates
up
you
fellows
or
be
another
corpse
here
nick
cried
sternly
with
the
rascals
effectively
covered
after
chick
patsy
i
can
attend
to
these
the
did
not
dare
to
show
fight
they
yielded
with
curses
and
imprecations
and
within
ten
more
minutes
the
case
was
practically
ended
all
were
secured
followed
later
by
zeke
wife
and
the
entire
family
went
to
prison
for
a
term
of
years
for
their
work
of
that
night
andy
margate
did
not
revive
from
the
dose
nick
carter
had
given
him
as
he
had
from
that
taken
from
his
own
hand
this
time
indeed
he
was
as
dead
as
a
doornail
the
document
as
well
as
the
property
stolen
from
senator
barclay
were
easily

the
circumstances

never

dreamed
of
by
sir
edward
deland
much
to
the
relief
and
gratitude
of
the
beautiful
girl
whom
nick
had
served
so
cleverly
he
went
even
farther
than
that
moreover
interceding
with
a
local
judge
for
the
medical
students
with
the
result
that
their
transgression
was
never
made
public
and
the
dabney
medical
college
escaped
without
a
smirch
on
its
reputation

the
strange
case
ended
to
the
satisfaction
of
all

i
the
boss
defied
the
man
in
the
gray
uniform
of
uncle
postal
service
laughed
lightly
talk
like
a
boob
he
said
not
defying
any
organization
and
i
have
no
desire
to
make
an
enemy
of
samuel
coggswell
or
anybody
else
if
petty
and
enough
to
get
sore
on
me
just
because
i
refuse
to
give
up
five
dollars
for
a
picnic
ticket
for
which
i
have
no
earthly
use
well
i
help
the
smile
upon
his
face
suddenly
gave
place
to
a
sterner
expression
let
me
tell
you
he
went
on
like
your
method
of
selling
tickets
the
way
you
go
about
it
looks
to
me
very
much
like
blackmail
i
never
had
the
pleasure
of
meeting
your
friend
coggswell
but
if
he
instructed
you
to
hold
up
strangers
on
the
street
and
hand
them
that
line
of
talk
i
any
use
for
him
and
you
can
tell
him
i
said
the
stout
flashily
dressed
young
man
who
had
accosted
the
letter
carrier
on
the
street
corner
just
as
the
latter
was
about
to
enter
branch
post
office
x
y
scowled
at
this
utterance
tell
him
all
right
he
retorted
can
bet
to
hear
about
your
freshness
your
name
anyway
sheridan
was
the
prompt
reply
the
other
produced
a
pencil
and
memorandum
book
from
his
vest
pocket
and
ostentatiously
made
a
note
of
the
name
well
sheridan
he
sneered
see
how
feel
when
on
boss
black
list
guess
make
you
lose
that
cocky
air
before
he
turned
on
his
heel
and
sauntered
off
up
the
street
carrier
sheridan
who
had
just
returned
from
his
delivery
route
entered
the
post
office
and
went
upstairs
to
the
the
place
in
which
the
carriers
lounge
between
tours
and
joined
a
dozen
of
his
comrades
who
were
indulging
in
a
few
minutes
of
idle
chatter
had
a
funny
experience
just
now
he
said
chap
buttonholed
me
on
the
corner
and
tried
to
sell
me
a
ticket
to
the
samuel
coggswell
annual
chowder
and
outing
when
i
refused
to
come
across
with
five
dollars
and
told
him
i
had
no
desire
to
go
to
the
outing
he
got
sore
and
began
to
threaten
me
with
the
wrath
of
coggswell
he
said
it
meant
my
finish
in
the
postal
service
if
i
give
up
can
you
beat
that
for
nerve
instead
of
the
loud
laugh
which
he
expected
some
of
the
carriers
smiled
sheepishly
and
others
looked
grave
mean
to
say
that
you
refused
to
take
the
ticket
son
exclaimed
andrews
a
grizzled
carrier
whose
coat
sleeve
bore
two
gold
stars
signifying
that
he
had
seen
forty
service
in
the
department
certainly
did
refuse
replied
young
sheridan
indignantly
you
suppose
for
a
minute
that
let
any
man
blackmail
me
into
giving
up
money
for
something
i
want
pop
andrews
shook
his
head
deprecatingly
was
foolish
of
you
very
foolish
if
you
want
to
get
along
in
this
business
you
afford
to
antagonize
coggswell
you
been
in
new
york
long
so
perhaps
you
know
who
and
what
he
is
yes
i
do
replied
sheridan
with
a
smile
heard
of
him
of
course
a
politician
and
the
leader
of
this
assembly
district
but
i
see
what
reason
got
to
be
afraid
of
him
as
long
as
i
do
my
duty
this
is
a
job
and
several
of
the
men
interrupted
him
with
bitter
laughter
pop
andrews
undertook
to
explain
the
reason
for
their
mirth
service
is
all
right
as
far
as
it
goes
son
he
said
gravely
the
trouble
is
it
go
very
far
not
nearly
as
far
as
the
pull
of
samuel
coggswell
see
he
went
on
boss
has
got
so
much
influence
at
washington
that
he
can
get
pretty
near
anything
he
wants
if
he
wishes
to
boost
a
postal
salary
or
land
him
a
soft
berth
he
can
do
it
with
a
few
strokes
of
his
pen
or
a
few
words
on
the
wire
but
if
he
wishes
to
keep
a
man
down
he
only
has
to
put
in
a
knock
at
headquarters
and
the
poor
goose
is
cooked
you
can
slave
and
study
and
take
all
the
exams
you
want
but
never
get
promotion
while
on
samuel
black
mean
it
exclaimed
sheridan
in
astonishment
that
fellow
spoke
the
truth
i
thought
he
was
only
trying
to
bluff
me
into
buying
a
ticket
for
the
gave
it
to
you
straight
replied
the
veteran
postman
have
refused
to
buy
the
ticket
i
guess
the
only
employee
in
this
branch
that
got
that
right
boys
demanded
the
astonished
carrier
turning
incredulously
to
his
comrades
mean
to
say
that
you
are
all
going
to
the
outing
the
other
carriers
laughed
reckon
mighty
few
of
us
be
there
said
one
gave
my
ticket
to
a
feller
that
keeps
a
delicatessen
shop
on
my
route
this
morning
it
any
use
to
why
on
earth
did
you
buy
it
demanded
sheridan
indignantly
the
reason
that
pop
has
just
given
you
because
i
want
to
stand
in
right
with
coggswell
was
the
candid
reply
why
we
all
buy
each
year
little
graft
he
knows
that
we
any
use
for
the
tickets
but
his
pleasant
little
way
of
collecting
five
dollars
a
year
from
each
of
us
the
pull
got
at
headquarters
we
think
a
mighty
good
think
a
dirty
piece
of
blackmail
declared
sheridan
his
eyes
flashing
submit
to
it
be
rash
son
broke
in
pop
andrews
kind
of
talk
sounds
good
behind
the
footlights
at
a
theater
but
take
it
from
me
it
carry
you
very
far
in
the
service
young
and
ambitious
you
want
to
get
up
in
the
department
take
my
advice
and
win
the
friendship
of
the
man
whose
pull
can
put
you
there
you
might
begin
by
joining
his
organization
what
a
good
many
of
the
fellows
in
this
branch
are
doing
wise
enough
to
see
the
advantage
of
being
a
member
of
the
samuel
coggswell
on
the
other
side
of
the
fence
protested
sheridan
politics
care
what
your
politics
are
interrupted
the
grizzled
carrier
with
a
sly
wink
election
day
comes
you
can
vote
whatever
way
you
want
we
all
do
that
coggswell
has
no
way
of
telling
in
which
column
you
put
the
cross
but
in
between
elections
belong
to
the
organization
and
whoop
it
up
for
coggswell
all
you
can
in
that
way
sure
to
bring
yourself
to
the
guess
brought
myself
to
his
attention
already
said
sheridan
with
a
whimsical
smile
see
pop
in
addition
to
refusing
to
buy
a
ticket
i
sent
him
a
message
telling
him
just
what
i
think
of
him
and
his
blackmailing
exclaimed
several
of
the
carriers
looking
at
their
comrade
commiseratingly
owen
sheridan
was
very
popular
with
the
employees
of
branch
x
y
and
they
would
have
been
sorry
to
see
him
come
to
grief
sort
of
a
man
was
this
fellow
you
were
up
against
inquired
pop
andrews
gravely
chap
about
my
own
age
i
should
judge
rather
stout
with
a
red
beefy
face
and
dressed
to
kill
replied
owen
had
a
diamond
in
his
necktie
so
big
that
it
almost
blinded
me
and
he
was
smoking
a
big
black
cigar
that
i
guess
only
a
politician
could
afford
to
was
jake
hines
declared
one
of
the
men
not
a
bad
sort
if
handled
right
said
pop
andrews
i
were
you
owen
go
and
see
him
this
evening
find
him
at
the
clubhouse
he
hangs
round
there
nearly
every
and
see
him
what
for
demanded
sheridan
in
astonishment
have
a
talk
with
him
and
straighten
things
out
of
course
you
want
to
lose
any
time
rectifying
the
blunder
made
tell
jake
that
been
thinking
things
over
and
decided
that
like
one
of
those
tickets
after
all
if
you
can
afford
it
it
would
be
a
good
scheme
to
take
two
to
help
smooth
things
over
you
owen
sheridan
laughed
heartily
at
this
suggestion
if
i
could
get
the
job
of
postmaster
general
merely
by
buying
one
of
those
tickets
i
buy
one
he
declared
resolutely
chapter
ii
summoned
by
the
boss
owen
comrades
had
not
been
guilty
of
exaggeration
in
warning
the
young
man
of
the
danger
he
ran
in
antagonizing
boss
coggswell
great
reforms
have
been
effected
in
the
united
states
postal
service
since
the
time
when
sheridan
entered
the
department
and
politicians
of
samuel
ilk
are
no
longer
able
to
terrorize
and
corrupt
the
employees
by
means
of
a
at
washington
a
certain
famous
investigation
resulted
in
the
indictment
of
many
big
and
little
postal
officials
and
the
laying
bare
of
a
startling
system
of
fraud
corruption
and
official
misconduct
and
made
it
happily
a
thing
of
the
past
but
before
that
big
occurred
the
power
of
the
political
boss
was
a
thing
to
be
feared
by
every
carrier
and
clerk
in
the
department
owen
was
not
greatly
disturbed
by
the
warnings
young
optimistic
he
could
scarcely
bring
himself
to
believe
that
the
big
career
he
had
mapped
out
for
himself
in
the
department
could
be
checked
or
affected
merely
by
his
refusal
to
buy
a
ticket
to
a
political
picnic
the
idea
appeared
preposterous
he
would
succeed
he
told
himself
confidently
in
spite
of
the
antagonism
of
samuel
coggswell
and
his
lieutenant
jake
hines
he
was
painstaking
a
hustler
and
keen
of
mind
these
qualities
he
felt
sure
were
bound
to
win
his
promotion
in
time
even
without
any
pull
not
worrying
much
about
coggswell
he
said
to
himself
with
a
smile
as
he
stood
at
his
in
the
post
office
sorting
the
mail
for
his
delivery
route
the
morning
after
his
encounter
with
jake
hines
what
is
worrying
me
a
lot
more
he
went
on
with
a
frown
this
confounded
by
jove
another
one
of
now
the
cause
of
his
emotion
was
an
envelope
which
had
just
turned
up
in
the
pile
of
mail
he
was
sorting
for
several
minutes
his
long
nimble
fingers
had
been
going
through
the
heap
of
letters
with
such
speed
and
dexterity
that
it
seemed
impossible
that
he
could
be
separating
and
arranging
them
in
rotation
according
to
the
house
numbers
on
his
delivery
route
he
seemed
scarcely
to
glance
at
the
addresses
on
the
envelopes
it
appeared
to
be
a
purely
mechanical
operation
although
there
was
nothing
about
this
particular
white
envelope
to
make
it
conspicuous
owen
recognized
it
as
soon
as
it
turned
up
with
a
look
of
deep
disgust
on
his
face
he
withdrew
it
from
the
pile
is
the
fifth
he
has
sent
her
in
the
past
week
he
muttered
wonder
who
the
fellow
is
and
what
he
is
to
her
i
wish
i
knew
of
course
i
do
anything
like
that
he
added
hastily
ashamed
of
the
unspoken
thought
is
mighty
tough
though
to
have
to
deliver
your
letters
to
the
girl
you
love
to
suspect
that
there
is
a
rival
is
bad
enough
but
to
have
to
be
the
bearer
of
his
confounded
letters
is
certainly
rubbing
it
uncle
men
in
gray
are
supposed
to
be
mere
automatons
when
it
comes
to
delivering
mail
one
of
the
rules
of
the
department
is
to
the
effect
that
carriers
must
not
indulge
in
any
unnecessary
conversation
while
covering
their
routes
and
of
course
they
are
not
supposed
to
ask
any
questions
or
betray
any
curiosity
concerning
the
letters
they
carry
owen
sheridan
was
well
up
on
the
rules
and
regulations
but
he
vowed
as
he
stepped
out
of
the
office
to
cover
his
route
that
he
was
going
to
find
out
the
significance
of
that
letter
before
another
hour
had
passed
for
thirty
minutes
he
went
briskly
from
house
to
house
stuffing
mail
into
letter
boxes
ringing
each
bell
blowing
his
whistle
in
every
vestibule
he
visited
then
having
finished
his
row
of
flat
houses
and
private
dwellings
on
the
side
street
he
swung
into
the
avenue
and
stopped
outside
a
store
on
the
window
of
which
was
the
sign
in
gilt
lettering
sammis
real
estate
and
for
a
second
he
stood
on
the
sidewalk
as
though
afraid
to
go
in
then
he
drew
a
long
breath
and
entered
a
half
dozen
letters
in
his
hand
among
them
the
envelope
which
was
causing
him
so
much
concern
a
young
woman
who
sat
at
a
typewriter
behind
the
barrier
which
divided
the
office
in
two
looked
up
from
her
machine
and
greeted
him
with
a
cordial
smile
morning
she
said
a
little
late
you
been
waiting
impatiently
for
you
i
mean
the
mail
for
the
past
ten
she
was
a
very
pretty
girl
her
hair
was
dark
her
eyes
were
brown
and
very
large
and
bright
her
cheeks
bewitchingly
pink
the
young
carrier
thrilled
as
he
looked
at
her
the
mail
is
kind
of
late
this
morning
miss
worthington
he
said
awkwardly
got
an
unusually
big
delivery
he
held
out
the
bunch
of
letters
in
his
hand
are
five
for
the
boss
and
one
for
he
watched
her
face
anxiously
as
she
extended
her
hand
for
the
mail
his
own
grew
dark
as
he
saw
her
eyes
light
up
at
the
sight
of
the
handwriting
on
the
envelope
addressed
to
her
you
seem
to
be
getting
an
awful
lot
of
mail
from
chicago
lately
he
remarked
gloomily
she
nodded
and
smiled
brightly
i
am
very
fortunate
this
is
the
fifth
this
all
from
the
same
fellow
he
exclaimed
with
a
bitter
laugh
how
do
you
know
that
she
demanded
looking
at
him
quizzically
from
under
her
long
lashes
you
suppose
i
can
recognize
the
handwriting
was
his
sullen
reply
she
laughed
think
you
letter
carriers
were
so
smart
considering
the
thousands
of
letters
you
must
handle
in
the
course
of
a
week
i
should
think
it
would
be
impossible
for
you
to
remember
the
handwriting
of
each
like
to
know
who
he
is
owen
broke
in
impulsively
really
sheridan
she
exclaimed
think
you
are
rather
impertinent
unless
i
am
greatly
mistaken
the
contents
of
the
letters
you
handle
do
not
concern
you
at
all
your
duty
is
to
deliver
mail
and
it
ends
her
tone
was
one
of
great
indignation
but
there
was
a
merry
twinkle
in
her
eye
he
was
so
dejected
however
that
he
did
not
notice
the
twinkle
contents
of
that
particular
letter
do
concern
me
very
much
miss
worthington
he
returned
doggedly
a
letter
carrier
i
admit
i
have
no
right
to
ask
you
any
questions
but
as
a
man
well
got
to
know
what
that
fellow
is
to
you
got
to
know
what
chance
i
stand
against
him
been
suffering
the
whole
week
ever
since
the
first
of
those
confounded
letters
made
its
appearance
and
i
stand
it
any
then
before
he
realized
what
he
was
doing
owen
sheridan
was
blurting
out
a
proposal
of
marriage
the
words
came
impulsively
from
his
lips
when
he
entered
the
office
five
minutes
previously
he
the
slightest
intention
of
taking
such
a
decisive
step
he
was
in
love
with
the
girl
to
be
sure
and
for
several
weeks
past
had
been
telling
himself
that
some
day
he
would
ask
her
to
be
his
wife
but
he
had
also
told
himself
that
the
day
was
far
off
he
was
not
in
a
position
to
think
of
marrying
as
yet
he
had
been
in
the
postal
service
for
less
than
a
year
and
consequently
was
receiving
only
six
hundred
dollars
per
year
to
marry
on
six
hundred
a
year
less
than
twelve
dollars
per
week
looked
much
too
difficult
and
out
of
this
modest
wage
too
he
had
to
buy
his
uniforms
complete
outfits
for
both
summer
and
winter
wear
he
would
have
to
work
for
at
least
five
years
more
before
he
attained
the
rank
of
carrier
and
a
salary
of
eleven
hundred
dollars
on
which
he
could
support
a
wife
for
this
reason
he
had
hesitated
to
speak
out
before
but
now
jealousy
aroused
by
those
letters
from
chicago
forced
the
words
from
his
lips
the
blood
rushed
to
dallas
cheeks
as
she
listened
to
him
you
want
me
to
marry
you
she
gasped
mean
it
why
you
scarcely
know
me
at
all
know
you
he
protested
i
been
seeing
you
every
day
for
the
past
six
months
but
only
when
come
in
here
to
bring
the
mail
you
learn
enough
about
a
girl
to
make
up
your
mind
that
it
my
fault
that
i
seen
you
after
office
hours
he
protested
asked
you
often
enough
to
let
me
take
you
out
or
call
at
your
boarding
house
but
always
turned
me
down
anyway
he
went
on
earnestly
know
you
well
enough
to
feel
sure
that
the
only
girl
for
me
why
so
crazy
about
you
that
on
deliveries
when
there
been
any
mail
for
this
address
delivered
the
wrong
letters
here
on
purpose
just
so
as
to
have
an
excuse
for
dropping
in
and
seeing
the
girl
laughed
so
why
this
office
is
always
getting
other
mail
often
wondered
how
you
could
be
so
there
any
chance
for
me
miss
worthington
the
young
carrier
asked
pleadingly
as
he
glanced
at
the
clock
on
the
wall
of
the
office
and
suddenly
realized
that
if
he
dallied
there
much
longer
there
would
be
complaints
all
along
his
route
for
the
bag
suspended
from
his
shoulder
was
still
half
full
of
undelivered
mail
and
people
in
new
york
city
are
very
particular
about
getting
their
letters
on
time
ask
you
to
marry
me
now
he
went
on
hastily
do
it
even
if
you
were
willing
for
not
making
enough
money
the
united
states
government
pays
its
postal
employees
poorly
at
the
start
i
guess
there
another
branch
of
the
federal
civil
service
where
a
fellow
has
to
do
so
much
for
so
little
you
get
out
and
go
into
something
else
she
asked
often
wondered
why
a
bright
fellow
like
you
should
be
satisfied
with
such
a
small
want
to
be
a
inspector
he
answered
the
goal
which
tempted
me
into
entering
the
service
those
fellows
earn
good
money
and
always
had
a
liking
for
detective
work
you
can
rest
assured
that
i
intend
to
remain
a
carrier
very
long
to
be
promoted
to
the
branch
of
the
department
is
my
ambition
and
i
feel
confident
that
be
able
to
realize
feel
sure
you
will
the
girl
said
softly
with
a
quick
glance
at
his
earnest
face
and
wait
for
you
owen
until
in
a
position
to
get
will
he
exclaimed
joyously
expect
such
luck
then
those
letters
from
chicago
from
my
brother
she
answered
with
a
laugh
two
years
younger
than
i
and
always
getting
into
scrapes
in
another
one
now
and
he
needs
money
why
been
writing
so
frequently
the
past
chapter
iii
the
wiggling
ear
owen
finished
his
deliveries
and
returned
to
the
post
office
with
a
much
lighter
heart
than
when
he
had
started
out
promised
to
wait
for
me
and
the
happiest
man
in
the
world
he
said
to
himself
with
a
smile
she
have
to
wait
so
very
long
either
going
after
that
inspector
job
hammer
and
tongs
and
nothing
can
stop
me
from
getting
you
carrier
owen
sheridan
inquired
a
voice
suddenly
breaking
in
upon
his
happy
meditations
answered
owen
to
the
young
man
who
addressed
him
to
come
around
to
the
club
at
this
evening
went
on
the
latter
in
a
peremptory
manner
club
what
club
demanded
owen
staring
hard
at
the
speaker
whom
he
had
never
seen
before
district
organization
of
course
replied
the
young
man
impatiently
suppose
i
meant
the
elks
or
the
knights
of
pythias
did
you
to
come
around
to
the
headquarters
of
the
samuel
coggswell
association
at
sharp
the
boss
wants
to
see
having
delivered
this
laconic
message
the
young
man
hurried
away
and
owen
stood
on
the
threshold
of
the
entrance
looking
after
him
in
great
astonishment
coggswell
wants
to
see
me
he
muttered
to
himself
wonder
what
on
earth
then
a
ray
of
enlightenment
came
to
him
and
he
grinned
broadly
guess
jake
hines
has
reported
to
him
what
i
said
about
those
tickets
and
his
majesty
has
sent
for
me
to
demand
an
explanation
and
an
a
frown
displaced
the
grin
upon
his
countenance
like
to
see
myself
going
he
muttered
coggswell
wants
any
explanation
have
to
come
to
me
and
at
that
i
guess
he
get
a
lot
of
but
after
a
half
reflection
he
changed
his
mind
and
decided
that
it
might
be
just
as
well
for
him
to
heed
the
summons
insultingly
peremptory
as
its
delivery
had
been
i
go
he
may
think
afraid
to
face
him
he
told
himself
besides
mighty
anxious
to
hear
what
he
has
to
so
at
that
evening
owen
being
through
with
his
work
proceeded
to
the
headquarters
of
the
samuel
coggswell
association
a
brownstone
structure
on
a
quiet
residence
street
the
quarters
of
the
district
organization
were
luxurious
for
a
political
club
handsome
oil
paintings
in
big
gilt
frames
lined
the
walls
of
the
reception
hall
into
which
the
letter
carrier
stepped
one
painting
which
hung
on
the
wall
opposite
the
entrance
so
that
a
eye
was
bound
to
strike
it
as
soon
as
he
stepped
through
the
door
was
the
portrait
of
a
dark
rather
stout
gentleman
who
stood
with
his
arms
folded
and
his
chin
sunk
upon
his
chest
a
pose
made
famous
by
the
late
napoleon
bonaparte
and
since
copied
by
many
others
a
brass
plate
attached
to
the
massive
gilt
frame
of
this
portrait
in
oils
bore
the
legend
samuel
by
this
token
owen
knew
that
he
was
gazing
upon
the
likeness
of
the
man
whom
he
had
come
to
see
he
had
never
before
met
or
seen
boss
coggswell
and
had
no
idea
what
he
looked
like
so
while
he
waited
to
be
announced
he
studied
the
picture
with
great
interest
he
was
greatly
astonished
at
what
he
saw
from
what
he
had
heard
and
read
of
political
bosses
in
general
he
had
formed
the
impression
that
they
were
all
rough
illiterate
men
of
a
rough
type
he
had
imagined
that
coggswell
would
be
like
this
but
the
face
which
looked
at
him
from
the
painting
was
one
of
refinement
the
forehead
was
broad
and
high
the
features
were
regular
the
mouth
was
curved
in
a
kind
almost
benevolent
smile
unless
the
artist
had
unduly
flattered
him
boss
coggswell
looked
very
much
like
a
gentleman
and
a
very
pleasant
sort
of
gentleman
at
that
the
young
man
who
had
gone
to
announce
arrival
to
the
boss
soon
returned
and
beckoned
to
the
letter
carrier
to
follow
him
he
led
the
way
through
a
billiard
room
and
among
the
men
playing
at
the
tables
owen
recognized
jake
hines
the
man
who
had
tried
in
vain
to
intimidate
him
into
buying
a
ticket
to
the
club
outing
although
the
carrier
was
not
now
wearing
his
gray
uniform
the
recognition
was
mutual
owen
could
tell
that
by
the
scowl
which
came
to
face
at
the
sight
of
him
and
as
he
passed
the
table
at
which
the
politician
was
playing
he
heard
him
mutter
something
under
his
breath
which
sounded
like
young
up
a
flight
of
stairs
which
led
to
a
door
marked
office
guide
conducted
him
in
response
to
a
knock
on
this
door
a
deep
pleasant
voice
cried
in
and
owen
found
himself
in
a
luxuriously
furnished
room
facing
a
rotund
smiling
man
who
sat
at
a
mahogany
desk
one
glance
at
boss
coggswell
convinced
the
letter
carrier
that
the
oil
painting
downstairs
was
an
excellent
portrait
the
district
leader
certainly
appeared
to
be
a
very
pleasant
man
it
seemed
hard
to
believe
that
he
could
be
the
kind
of
fellow
who
would
persecute
a
humble
employee
for
refusing
to
give
up
five
dollars
for
a
ticket
to
a
club
outing
down
young
man
said
coggswell
motioning
to
a
chair
beside
his
desk
are
carrier
sheridan
i
believe
and
you
have
route
number
answered
owen
inwardly
wondering
why
the
political
leader
should
have
taken
the
trouble
to
familiarize
himself
with
the
number
of
his
delivery
route
am
informed
went
on
coggswell
with
a
gentle
smile
you
refused
to
buy
a
ticket
to
the
annual
chowder
and
outing
of
our
replied
owen
meeting
his
gaze
boldly
to
himself
he
thought
certainly
losing
any
time
in
getting
down
to
i
am
informed
also
boss
coggswell
went
on
still
with
the
same
gentle
smile
you
expressed
an
opinion
that
my
method
of
selling
tickets
was
closely
akin
to
blackmail
say
exactly
that
returned
owen
know
what
method
of
selling
tickets
may
be
but
i
did
say
that
if
you
instructed
or
sanctioned
your
followers
to
hold
up
government
employees
and
threaten
them
with
all
sorts
of
dire
disaster
if
they
refused
to
buy
those
tickets
you
were
a
blackmailer
and
i
had
no
use
for
he
looked
coggswell
squarely
in
the
eye
moreover
i
am
still
of
the
same
opinion
he
added
quietly
for
a
few
seconds
the
two
men
sat
eyeing
each
other
then
the
political
boss
suddenly
leaned
forward
in
his
chair
and
placed
his
plump
hand
upon
shoulder
man
he
said
like
you
for
that
you
make
a
hit
with
me
a
fellow
who
is
not
afraid
to
speak
out
always
has
my
admiration
i
despise
a
man
who
will
submit
to
injustice
and
tyranny
for
fear
of
losing
his
job
or
the
hope
of
getting
a
better
to
say
that
owen
was
astonished
by
this
treatment
would
be
to
put
it
mildly
he
looked
at
the
speaker
incredulously
the
suspicion
entered
his
head
that
perhaps
coggswell
was
merely
playing
with
him
as
a
cat
plays
with
a
mouse
handing
him
these
verbal
bouquets
first
of
all
in
order
to
give
the
more
force
to
the
abuse
and
threats
which
were
about
to
follow
the
boss
went
on
soon
as
i
heard
that
there
was
a
young
man
at
branch
x
y
who
had
the
courage
to
defy
me
i
made
up
my
mind
to
send
for
him
i
wanted
to
see
what
you
looked
like
i
wished
to
find
out
whether
you
would
have
backbone
enough
to
stand
by
what
you
had
said
to
jake
hines
or
whether
you
would
cringe
and
back
water
as
soon
as
i
put
it
up
to
owen
not
knowing
what
answer
to
make
to
these
amazing
words
smiled
lightly
and
remained
silent
after
a
slight
pause
boss
coggswell
went
on
am
pretty
good
at
sizing
up
men
sheridan
and
i
like
your
style
i
should
be
pleased
to
have
you
join
my
organization
we
need
young
men
of
your
caliber
in
this
you
replied
owen
i
care
to
go
into
politics
and
besides
i
am
of
the
opposite
like
you
for
saying
that
too
declared
the
district
leader
warmly
is
refreshing
to
meet
a
young
man
who
is
so
loyal
to
his
party
that
he
desert
it
even
to
advance
himself
i
am
sorry
that
we
have
you
in
our
organization
sheridan
but
i
am
going
to
help
you
nevertheless
i
have
taken
a
great
fancy
to
you
and
i
am
going
to
see
that
you
get
ahead
me
a
little
about
yourself
he
went
on
long
have
you
been
in
the
postal
service
months
answered
owen
what
is
your
ambition
surely
a
bright
young
chap
like
you
intend
to
remain
a
carrier
all
his
life
if
i
can
help
it
replied
owen
with
a
smile
am
looking
for
the
job
of
inspector
what
caused
me
to
enter
the
murmured
coggswell
inspector
eh
you
know
a
good
thing
when
you
see
it
you
got
any
pull
i
but
studying
hard
and
i
think
i
shall
soon
be
able
to
take
the
examinations
and
a
loud
laugh
from
boss
coggswell
interrupted
him
examinations
pshaw
they
get
you
very
far
unless
got
a
pretty
strong
pull
he
looked
keenly
at
the
young
man
and
lowered
his
voice
a
trifle
as
he
went
on
as
i
presume
you
are
aware
i
have
considerable
influence
at
washington
i
think
i
shall
use
that
influence
to
get
you
what
you
want
owen
stared
at
him
incredulously
you
joking
with
me
he
demanded
at
all
i
am
perfectly
serious
as
i
said
before
you
have
made
a
big
hit
with
me
and
i
want
to
help
you
to
get
you
the
post
you
are
looking
for
will
not
be
difficult
you
may
have
to
wait
a
little
while
for
there
are
no
vacancies
at
present
but
i
give
you
my
word
that
as
soon
as
one
occurs
you
shall
be
made
an
he
rose
from
his
chair
and
held
out
his
hand
to
owen
to
indicate
that
the
interview
was
at
an
end
i
am
very
glad
to
have
met
you
he
said
heartily
to
your
job
as
carrier
for
the
present
and
rest
assured
that
it
be
very
long
before
you
will
be
in
the
secret
feeling
as
if
he
were
in
a
dream
owen
rose
and
walked
toward
the
door
but
just
as
he
was
about
to
turn
the
handle
voice
halted
him
by
the
way
said
the
politician
in
a
careless
tone
is
one
little
point
that
i
had
almost
forgotten
i
think
you
cover
route
number
do
you
not
that
is
my
regular
coggswell
drew
nearer
to
owen
and
lowered
his
voice
almost
to
a
whisper
sheridan
suppose
there
was
somebody
residing
on
your
route
whose
mail
i
happened
to
be
interested
in
suppose
i
had
good
reasons
for
wishing
to
examine
this
letters
without
his
knowledge
of
course
suppose
i
asked
you
not
to
deliver
anything
to
him
until
after
it
had
first
passed
through
my
hands
or
the
hands
of
a
trusted
agent
what
would
you
say
to
that
sheridan
would
tell
you
to
go
to
blazes
replied
owen
promptly
am
not
a
crook
so
here
was
the
nigger
in
the
woodpile
at
last
this
was
the
meaning
of
all
the
soft
words
that
had
gone
before
and
the
glittering
promise
which
the
politician
had
made
to
him
are
quite
sure
that
you
do
me
a
little
favor
like
that
the
boss
went
on
looking
searchingly
into
the
young
face
answered
owen
shortly
even
if
your
promotion
to
the
job
of
inspector
depended
upon
it
one
good
turn
deserves
another
you
would
rather
remain
a
carrier
all
my
life
than
stoop
to
such
dirty
work
declared
the
carrier
hotly
think
it
over
sheridan
be
rash
it
would
be
a
pity
for
a
bright
young
fellow
like
you
to
have
his
career
ruined
for
a
little
thing
like
this
you
understand
of
course
that
there
be
the
slightest
danger
of
this
man
finding
out
that
his
mail
had
been
tampered
with
he
would
receive
every
letter
in
perfect
shape
you
be
running
any
possible
risk
of
make
any
difference
retorted
owen
safe
to
do
so
or
not
nobody
is
going
to
tamper
with
any
mail
in
my
really
mean
that
not
making
any
grandstand
play
eh
never
meant
anything
more
in
my
life
for
several
seconds
the
two
men
stood
staring
fixedly
into
each
eyes
then
suddenly
boss
coggswell
once
more
placed
his
hand
upon
the
shoulder
was
only
a
joke
my
boy
or
rather
i
should
say
it
was
a
little
test
i
wanted
to
determine
your
strength
of
character
and
i
must
say
that
you
have
met
the
test
remarkably
well
i
know
now
for
sure
that
you
are
honest
and
not
to
be
tempted
with
a
paternal
pat
on
the
shoulder
the
politician
dismissed
his
visitor
owen
was
very
thoughtful
as
he
walked
out
of
the
clubhouse
he
was
not
by
any
means
convinced
that
the
sinister
proposition
which
had
been
made
to
him
was
nothing
more
than
a
harmless
ruse
to
test
his
character
in
spite
of
the
reassuring
words
he
felt
sure
that
coggswell
had
been
very
much
in
earnest
about
wanting
him
to
hand
over
the
mail
of
somebody
on
his
route
that
was
the
real
reason
he
had
been
summoned
to
the
clubhouse
owen
recalled
something
which
he
had
once
heard
somebody
say
regarding
samuel
coggswell
a
very
queer
remark
which
had
been
made
in
his
presence
one
day
by
a
man
who
knew
the
boss
well
you
are
talking
with
sammy
this
man
had
said
his
ears
carefully
if
they
begin
to
wiggle
look
out
for
a
crooked
deal
most
men
move
their
ears
without
moving
the
rest
of
their
heads
besides
but
boss
coggswell
can
wiggle
either
ear
at
will
and
whenever
up
to
to
some
low
trick
those
ears
of
his
always
begin
to
move
he
can
keep
the
rest
of
his
face
as
straight
as
a
poker
player
he
can
smile
on
you
as
sweetly
as
if
he
loved
you
like
a
brother
when
all
the
time
he
hates
you
like
poison
he
can
keep
his
voice
as
smooth
as
velvet
but
he
make
his
ears
behave
when
anything
crooked
going
on
inside
his
owen
recalled
these
words
now
as
he
stepped
out
of
the
clubhouse
and
he
recalled
too
that
all
the
while
samuel
coggswell
had
been
talking
to
him
about
that
scheme
to
tamper
with
the
united
states
mail
his
ears
had
been
moving
up
and
down
as
if
on
springs
therefore
owen
felt
sure
that
there
was
mischief
brewing
to
be
continued
unexpected
he
had
been
trying
to
impress
upon
the
children
in
the
school
in
the
capacity
of
a
temperance
lecturer
that
though
it
was
right
and
proper
to
relieve
suffering
and
poverty
it
was
much
better
to
find
out
the
cause
of
it
all
drink
of
course
and
remove
that
and
so
with
everything
he
said
your
father
some
morning
came
downstairs
and
on
going
to
the
cellar
found
it
flooded
what
would
he
do
first
would
he
begin
bailing
the
water
out
of
course
what
would
be
the
first
thing
do
after
a
short
silence
a
shrill
piping
voice
cried
out
carry
on
awful
summertime
in
the
country
by
max
adeler
we
have
moved
into
the
country
to
stay
for
a
few
weeks
with
some
of
our
relations
they
gave
us
such
very
warm
and
repeated
invitations
that
we
concluded
to
make
some
sacrifice
to
go
to
oblige
them
and
i
had
no
idea
how
much
they
appreciated
our
company
until
the
end
of
the
first
week
when
they
handed
me
a
bill
for
fifty
dollars
for
board
for
three
of
us
life
in
the
country
is
very
charming
in
summertime
we
sleep
in
the
spare
room
in
the
garret
where
the
temperature
gets
up
to
one
hundred
and
four
degrees
the
roof
has
not
been
repaired
since
columbus
landed
and
consequently
it
is
full
of
apertures
for
any
one
who
wants
to
study
astronomy
while
lying
in
bed
our
garret
offers
phenomenal
advantages
but
whenever
it
rains
at
night
there
is
nothing
to
be
done
but
to
make
a
raft
out
of
the
clothes
horse
and
some
bed
slats
and
float
the
family
until
daylight
it
is
sometimes
an
exciting
apartment
a
few
nights
ago
while
hitting
at
a
mosquito
with
a
shuck
pillow
i
knocked
a
nest
off
of
one
of
the
rafters
and
in
the
morning
we
had
knobs
as
big
as
hickory
nuts
all
over
our
faces
and
legs
it
is
a
good
thing
to
live
out
here
in
the
country
because
the
air
is
so
healthful
we
get
our
morning
air
very
early
the
family
is
routed
out
at
four
so
that
the
men
may
go
to
the
harvest
field
and
if
we
lie
abed
there
will
be
nothing
to
eat
until
dinnertime
to
be
sure
that
would
not
make
any
very
great
difference
if
we
could
live
without
food
for
country
diet
is
not
as
attractive
as
i
hoped
it
would
be
we
always
have
salt
ham
and
fried
potatoes
for
breakfast
then
we
have
boiled
ham
and
potatoes
for
dinner
and
cold
potatoes
and
sliced
ham
for
supper
on
sundays
we
have
two
kinds
of
ham
and
stewed
potatoes
and
potato
pudding
for
dessert
when
i
asked
for
milk
for
the
children
they
said
they
were
using
all
the
milk
to
fatten
the
calves
they
apologized
for
not
having
butter
because
the
hucksters
who
supplied
it
come
i
threw
out
a
hint
about
raspberries
but
they
said
the
man
at
the
store
was
expecting
them
every
day
from
the
city
and
i
would
have
to
wait
they
get
their
potatoes
from
the
city
too
and
the
ham
was
cured
in
cincinnati
the
only
vegetable
that
grows
here
is
cabbage
but
we
are
not
allowed
to
eat
it
because
they
trade
it
off
at
the
store
for
potatoes
and
they
swap
their
chickens
to
the
huckster
for
butter
that
is
their
young
chickens
we
had
for
dinner
one
day
a
hen
that
cackled
during
the
war
of
she
ate
like
a
piece
of
boot
one
of
the
finest
things
about
living
in
the
country
is
that
you
can
wander
off
to
some
shady
spot
and
lie
in
luxurious
ease
upon
the
grass
dreaming
away
the
hours
and
while
you
are
dreaming
away
the
hours
straddle
bugs
will
probably
crawl
up
your
pantaloons
and
bite
you
and
caterpillars
will
insert
themselves
between
your
shirt
collar
and
neck
when
you
get
home
you
find
that
you
have
caught
a
frightful
cold
from
lying
on
the
damp
grass
and
while
you
are
sneezing
you
learn
that
one
of
the
children
has
fallen
out
of
the
haymow
and
run
a
pitchfork
through
his
calf
and
that
the
other
one
has
been
pitched
over
the
fence
by
the
durham
bull
then
we
like
to
sit
out
in
the
cool
of
the
evening
and
enjoy
the
calm
quiet
solitude
of
the
place
there
is
a
canal
at
the
end
of
the
lawn
and
when
we
get
enough
of
the
quiet
solitude
the
jane
of
will
come
along
and
we
will
be
entertained
by
the
captain
who
swears
violently
at
the
boy
because
he
does
not
stimulate
the
mules
to
sufficient
activity
as
he
wakes
the
echoes
with
his
abnormal
profanity
we
suddenly
put
the
children
to
bed
to
protect
them
from
demoralization
and
then
when
the
hind
mule
has
kicked
at
the
boy
three
or
four
times
the
boat
passes
upstream
and
silence
once
more
returns
we
sit
there
until
bedtime
beating
off
the
mosquitoes
with
one
hand
and
scratching
the
bites
with
the
other
and
as
soon
as
we
get
into
our
garret
with
a
candle
the
atmosphere
is
filled
with
bugs
which
dance
around
the
room
and
beat
against
the
walls
until
we
go
to
sleep
it
is
a
good
thing
to
live
in
the
country
because
the
children
have
such
a
chance
to
obtain
vigorous
health
they
begin
the
summer
in
the
country
with
prickly
heat
before
that
is
cured
they
get
cholera
morbus
from
eating
green
apples
afterward
they
catch
mumps
from
the
children
on
the
next
farm
and
at
intermediate
periods
they
get
bitten
by
the
dog
they
come
near
drowning
in
the
creek
they
are
sunstruck
they
rub
against
poison
vine
in
the
woods
and
swell
up
they
are
tangled
in
the
mower
and
lose
fingers
in
the
feed
cutter
they
are
run
over
by
the
ox
cart
and
ground
up
in
the
threshing
machine
then
they
cry
all
night
in
our
garret
and
eat
so
much
at
meals
that
the
owner
of
the
house
looks
sour
at
them
and
growls
out
something
about
raising
the
price
of
board
and
they
wear
out
clothes
enough
to
run
an
orphan
asylum
for
a
couple
of
years
one
of
the
best
things
about
the
country
is
that
it
gives
you
a
chance
to
go
we
fish
in
the
creek
after
digging
for
a
couple
of
hours
in
search
of
worms
we
go
to
the
water
and
throw
in
i
get
a
bite
and
pull
up
and
the
line
winds
tightly
around
the
limb
of
a
tree
then
i
shin
up
the
tree
and
undo
it
and
throw
in
again
after
several
more
ineffectual
bites
i
pull
up
an
eel
and
find
that
he
has
swallowed
the
hook
everybody
knows
how
it
is
with
an
eel
you
might
as
well
try
to
hold
a
streak
of
lightning
when
he
has
covered
your
boots
with
slime
he
bites
the
line
off
and
wriggles
back
into
the
water
when
you
have
put
on
a
new
hook
you
get
a
bite
and
jerk
out
a
muddy
snag
and
then
you
catch
one
small
minnow
and
find
that
you
have
been
sitting
in
a
puddle
of
water
waiting
for
him
to
nibble
as
your
bait
is
exhausted
you
conclude
to
go
home
where
you
can
put
some
ointment
on
your
blistered
hands
and
face
and
pick
the
ticks
out
of
your
skin
and
have
sewed
up
the
rents
made
in
your
trousers
by
the
blackberry
bushes
and
get
ready
for
the
mosquitoes
in
the
evening
there
are
some
very
peculiar
charms
about
rural
life
and
the
farmer
is
the
noblest
man
on
earth
but
as
for
me
i
believe
i
prefer
existence
in
an
alley
in
the
city
to
even
temporary
residence
among
the
agricultural
population
the
news
of
all
nations
failed
to
get
guinea
eggs
last
autumn
clinton
struble
of
penn
yan
bought
one
hundred
guinea
fowls
of
a
dealer
in
north
carolina
with
the
intention
of
raising
guineas
on
his
esperanza
estate
for
the
rochester
market
the
flock
has
had
the
best
of
care
and
has
been
fed
with
every
variety
of
supposedly
concoctions
known
to
yates
county
poultrymen
notwithstanding
this
treatment
which
has
been
kept
up
for
over
six
months
not
one
egg
was
received
recently
struble
took
a
poultry
expert
home
with
him
in
the
hope
that
he
might
find
out
what
the
trouble
has
been
the
expert
found
the
flock
in
a
splendidly
healthy
condition
but
all
male
birds
high
not
dry
is
a
dead
man
on
the
roof
of
city
hall
was
the
telephone
message
to
mayor
office
in
new
york
city
the
other
afternoon
like
alarms
followed
from
tenants
of
skyscrapers
around
city
hall
park
peter
chieffo
the
janitor
was
sent
aloft
to
investigate
the
janitor
found
a
man
stretched
out
asleep
on
the
sunny
side
of
the
clock
tower
there
was
an
aroma
of
rum
about
him
and
a
spirit
of
rebellion
in
his
heart
he
protested
volubly
at
being
awakened
warm
up
here
he
said
lem
me
chieffo
helped
him
down
first
by
the
ladder
which
leads
from
the
attic
to
the
skylight
on
the
roof
then
down
two
flights
of
spiral
stairs
and
lastly
down
the
three
remaining
marble
flights
to
city
hall
park
how
he
got
up
there
with
the
bundle
he
was
carrying
is
a
question
which
puzzles
the
members
of
the
board
of
estimate
the
visitor
was
unable
to
explain
or
even
to
give
his
name
sudden
finish
of
a
reign
in
the
early
spring
of
the
then
little
mining
city
of
joplin
began
to
hear
rumors
of
a
great
find
of
shallow
lead
on
the
banks
of
creek
just
across
the
state
line
in
kansas
short
is
a
little
stream
that
rises
in
the
western
part
of
jasper
county
missouri
and
after
meandering
around
a
few
miles
empties
into
spring
river
in
the
eastern
part
of
cherokee
county
kansas
the
new
discovery
of
lead
was
on
this
stream
some
nine
miles
from
joplin
at
that
time
zinc
mining
was
still
in
its
infancy
in
fact
there
were
thousands
of
tons
of
zinc
ore
which
under
the
name
of
jack
had
been
thrown
out
from
the
lead
with
which
it
mingled
and
lay
in
the
old
dumps
of
the
region
but
the
new
strike
was
of
lead
only
and
shallow
lead
was
the
one
thing
sought
after
by
the
miners
of
those
days
then
there
followed
a
worthy
to
be
classed
with
those
we
have
read
about
as
occurring
in
the
gold
fields
one
year
from
that
day
there
was
on
that
ground
a
thriving
little
city
that
claimed
a
population
of
people
there
flocked
in
every
blackleg
and
professional
from
a
wide
section
of
country
gambling
of
all
grades
flourished
unchecked
in
the
broad
light
of
day
half
the
buildings
were
saloons
and
a
large
share
of
the
other
half
were
brothels
the
crooked
little
trail
along
which
the
buildings
of
the
place
were
scattered
was
very
appropriately
dubbed
by
the
miners
and
it
played
fully
up
to
its
name
for
many
weeks
naturally
such
surroundings
and
conditions
bred
crime
there
was
quarreling
fighting
and
bloodshed
one
or
two
men
dropped
out
of
sight
but
their
disappearance
caused
hardly
a
ripple
of
inquiry
they
were
mostly
of
that
sort
who
with
their
boots
on
and
no
one
mourned
their
loss
gradually
the
evil
elements
grew
bolder
and
under
the
lead
of
the
bolder
spirits
among
them
took
advantage
of
the
general
disorder
to
rob
and
plunder
at
every
opportunity
at
the
head
of
these
plunderers
was
one
of
those
characters
of
whom
we
read
in
stories
of
wild
western
life
and
whose
likeness
we
may
still
see
exploited
upon
the
screen
of
the
moving
pictures
he
was
a
typical
of
the
western
mining
country
a
tall
finely
formed
fellow
with
a
handsome
face
he
wore
his
hair
well
down
onto
his
shoulders
sported
boots
a
pair
of
big
revolvers
and
when
under
the
influence
of
liquor
which
was
practically
all
the
time
he
was
a
dangerous
man
the
respectable
element
feared
him
and
the
coterie
which
followed
his
lead
but
there
was
no
organized
authority
to
appeal
to
for
protection
and
nothing
was
done
while
the
gang
went
on
their
way
unchecked
and
grew
in
insolence
and
outrage
day
by
day
this
wild
leader
of
a
wild
band
called
himself
and
boasted
loudly
of
the
men
he
had
killed
in
other
places
and
as
to
the
valiant
things
he
proposed
to
do
on
short
creek
but
the
men
of
the
place
were
mostly
too
busy
to
pay
any
attention
to
the
vaporings
of
tiger
bill
and
as
time
went
on
he
waxed
more
truculent
and
boastful
than
ever
but
he
was
destined
to
meet
disaster
at
the
moment
when
his
prestige
was
greatest
and
from
a
source
the
very
last
that
either
the
desperado
himself
or
any
one
else
would
have
thought
capable
of
resistance
to
his
will
among
the
dozen
or
so
plank
sheds
along
street
that
had
up
the
name
of
was
a
rough
box
of
a
place
presided
over
by
a
little
german
he
was
a
little
man
with
weak
eyes
sheltered
behind
a
pair
of
large
spectacles
he
was
an
industrious
fellow
who
attended
strictly
to
his
business
and
whose
only
name
so
far
as
we
knew
was
gus
one
morning
tiger
bill
rose
in
an
unusually
ferocious
frame
of
mind
the
luck
had
been
against
him
at
cards
the
night
before
and
his
morning
potations
had
not
sufficed
to
soothe
his
ruffled
spirits
walking
along
street
he
spied
little
gus
hard
at
work
in
his
shed
the
sight
seemed
to
fire
soul
with
a
desire
to
exploit
his
fame
in
the
place
he
felt
assured
that
the
inoffensive
little
german
was
a
tenderfoot
ready
to
his
hand
on
whom
he
could
demonstrate
his
valor
and
satisfy
his
desire
for
blood
and
fame
in
perfect
safety
to
himself
a
long
time
he
remarked
to
the
henchman
at
his
side
a
long
time
since
i
had
a
man
for
breakfast
watch
me
get
the
little
so
saying
he
strode
into
the
place
with
his
revolver
held
ostentatiously
in
his
right
hand
walking
up
to
the
rough
board
counter
he
said
you
little
cuss
give
me
half
a
dozen
raw
oysters
do
it
pretty
quick
too
if
you
know
what
is
good
for
gus
hastened
to
fill
the
order
not
a
sign
did
he
show
of
fear
but
some
remarked
later
that
he
served
the
oysters
with
his
left
hand
shouted
bill
do
you
mean
sticking
such
oysters
as
them
under
my
nose
and
at
the
word
he
dashed
the
contents
of
the
dish
full
in
the
face
of
the
german
as
he
did
so
he
threw
up
his
hand
holding
the
revolver
beyond
question
he
meant
to
kill
gus
but
tiger
bill
never
fired
that
shot
quicker
than
even
his
trained
and
murderous
hand
quick
as
a
flash
indeed
the
little
hand
came
up
and
it
held
a
big
colt
revolver
and
in
an
instant
the
desperado
was
as
dead
as
he
could
reasonably
expect
to
be
with
a
bullet
hole
drilled
neatly
through
his
head
a
great
crowd
instantly
rushed
in
bill
lay
dead
upon
the
floor
his
right
hand
still
holding
the
revolver
behind
the
counter
stood
gus
quietly
wiping
off
the
mess
of
oysters
from
his
face
and
the
counter
lord
gus
what
have
you
done
shouted
one
gott
replied
gus
must
i
do
he
vas
schlapped
me
mit
der
oysters
of
der
face
already
und
he
vas
his
gun
have
ready
to
shoot
next
time
maybe
he
takes
a
tenderfoot
maybe
eh
there
was
nothing
further
to
be
said
gus
had
stated
the
question
perfectly
so
they
picked
up
what
was
left
of
tiger
bill
and
clad
as
he
was
and
his
boots
on
they
thrust
him
into
a
hole
in
the
woods
then
the
decent
element
always
in
a
large
majority
rallied
and
elected
men
to
serve
as
a
committee
to
control
the
town
until
such
time
as
a
regular
government
could
be
established
one
of
the
first
duties
that
committee
discharged
was
to
send
forth
notice
that
if
any
of
the
tiger
bill
crowd
or
their
sympathizers
were
caught
in
short
creek
that
night
there
would
be
one
of
the
largest
and
liveliest
hangings
in
history
that
notice
was
enough
without
tiger
bill
the
courage
of
the
bunch
was
wholly
a
minus
quantity
and
they
stayed
not
upon
the
order
of
their
going
but
went
silent
workers
of
the

better
known
as

disguises
are
not
used
by
those
in
the
service
if
the
matter
in
hand
for
instance
requires
the
collection
of
information
from
workmen
a
man
is
chosen
who
looks
the
part
without
a
disguise
he
simply
wears
such
clothes
as
workmen
wear
and
affects
the
manners
and
speech
of
the
men
with
whom
he
mingles
on
the
other
hand
if
the
work
requires
contact
with
people
in
a
walk
of
life
or
with
foreigners
or
negroes
an
operative
of
the
same
class
is
chosen
the

secret

is
under
the
direct
supervision
of
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
the
only
thing
that
can
land
a
man
in
its
employ
is
passing
the
preliminary
examination
submitting
to
a
personal
interview
with
chief
flynn
and
showing
nerve
and
ability
during
a
month
of
testing
out
in
the
real
business
of
detective
work
for
uncle
sam
if
a
man
makes
good
after
this
preliminary
test
he
goes
on
the
roll

the

here
are
the
private

of

are

there
is
a
saying
in
the
service
that
a
counterfeiter
always
a

was
created
primarily
to
catch
counterfeiters
and
protect
the

his
direction
from

to
time
as
many
assistants
as
the
criminal
activities
in
his

demand
perhaps
the
most
picturesque
work
of

is
performed
by
its
the
field
workers
who
may
be
sent
to
any
place
at
any

most
of
these
men
are
not
much
above
thirty
years
of
age
the
average
age
of

are

energetic
resourceful
and
capable
of
assuming
almost

if
he
proves

he
is

the
rank

his
pay
may
increase

before

he
must

and
have
acquired
a
considerable
fund
of
practical

valuable
to

one
of
the
most
mysterious
phases
of
the
work
concerns
the
maintenance
of
communication
between
the
central
office
in
washington
and
its
field

a

there
is
no

on

they
are
getting
a
line
on
the

haunts
and
byways
of
certain
people
who
seem
to
be
living
without
apparent
effort
the
shadowed
party
does
not
suspect
it
and
he
may
never
know
some
years
ago
there
was
a
notorious
counterfeiter
named
emanuel
ninger
who
for
seventeen
years
kept
the
men
of
the
whole
country
chasing
him
when
they
finally
landed
him
they
had
enough
evidence
against
him
to
convict
him
on
a
dozen
counts
ninger
was
a
manufacturer
of
paper
money
being
a
skillful
artist
he
was
able
to
paint
on
white
paper
an
reproduction
of
a
ten
or
bill
but
the
wet
finger
of
a
bartender
coming
in
contact
with
one
of
bills
caused
the
color
to
ninger
had
passed
this
particular
bill
himself
and
through
it
he
was
traced
arrested
and
convicted
at
the
time
of
his
arrest
the
washington
bureau
had
on
hand
a
large
collection
of
notes
but
ninger
until
apprehended
had
been
unknown
to
the
secret
service
and
the
notes
were
credited
to
the
an
indiana
preacher
william
wade
turned
counterfeiter
but
confined
himself
to
pieces
the
men
were
never
able
to
discover
the
location
of
his
factory
nor
find
his
apparatus
but
the
evidence
against
him
was
conclusive
and
he
was
convicted
he
served
his
term
in
the
penitentiary
during
the
fiscal
year
ended
june
last
there
were
arrests
by
the
secret

with
seizure
of
of

j
deidrich
of

which
he
believes
will
be
especially
valuable
for

the
knife
is
not
much
different
from
the
ordinary
bread
knife
but
it
is
suspended
from
a
frame
which
causes
it
to
come
down
in

place
each

it
is
swung
for

there
is
also

while
sitting
down
it
looks
as

especially
when
it
stretches
its
upper
legs
but
generally
they
lie
flat
when
walking
the
upper
legs
keep
in

as
if
they
helped
the
little
chick
to

seems
healthy

there

by

a

representative
of

in
the

the

it
all
came
about
something
like
this
little
benjamin
grant
son
of
j
grant
dothan
banker
and
several
other
playmates
whose
ages
averaged
about
the
mark
had
slipped
from
their
nurses
who
chatted
in
the
sunshine
and
were
enjoying
the
fine
spring
morning
away
up
under
the
grant
residence
digging
trenches
making
frog
houses
tunnels
and
such
things
and
getting
their
fresh
linen
just
as
dirty
as
they
suddenly
benjamin
disappeared
right
before
the
eyes
of
his
mystified
young
friends
it
was
as
if
the
earth
had
swallowed
him
up
the
tot
had
slipped
into
a
deserted
bored
well
hid
up
under
the
house
for
so
long
that
no
one
ever
remembered
when
it
had
been
dug
when
it
had
been
used
or
when
it
had
been
deserted
and
covered
up
by
the
building
moreover
no
one
happened
to
know
how
deep
it
was
as
was
later
learned
and
with
these
thoughts
rushing
through
her
frightened
brain
the
nurse
girl
in
charge
of
little
ben
prepared
to
inform
the
mother
that
her
son
was
somewhere
below
earth
in
a
darkened
unknown
hole
the
alarm
spread
with
a
swiftness
hardly
believable
within
a
few
minutes
every
woman
in
the
neighborhood
and
every
man
who
might
be
located
sitting
about
home
during
the
busy
part
of
the
morning
had
rushed
to
the
scene
the
hole
into
which
the
boy
had
fallen
was
not
large
enough
to
carry
light
more
than
a
few
feet
no
man
in
a
thousand
could
squeeze
his
shoulders
into
the
opening
to
be
exact
it
measured
thirteen
inches
in
diameter
as
a
later
measurement
showed
several
men
gazed
into
the
blackness
of
the
hole
and
gazed
back
again
their
faces
pale
their
eyes
wide
with
a
helplessness
that
brought
on
an
uncanny
fright
even
in
the
hearts
of
the
strongest
some
suggested
a
rope
others
thought
of
hooks
and
some
said
dig
a
tunnel
all
soon
agreed
however
that
none
of
the
plans
of
rescue
could
be
carried
out
for
a
boy
would
never
be
expected
to
grab
a
rope
to
be
pulled
through
yards
and
yards
of
a
bored
well
iron
hooks
might
tear
the
baby
to
pieces
while
rescuers
knelt
and
heard
his
cries
in
vain
and
a
tunnel
to
the
distance
where
his
cries
indicated
he
had
fallen
would
certainly
mean
a
fatal
suggestions
that
some
person
be
lowered
had
of
course
been
advanced
long
before
but
had
proven
useless
for
not
one
person
in
the
great
crowd
could
enter
the
small
opening
out
and
get
some
boys
shouted
one
of
the
directors
of
the
work
the
schools
and
their
numerous
offerings
of
all
sizes
and
ages
of
lads
came
first
into
the
minds
of
the
volunteer
hunters
two
automobiles
rushed
to
a
school
less
than
three
blocks
away
want
the
nerviest
bravest
kids
got
in
the
building
said
a
member
of
the
party
to
the
superintendent
us
some
small
ones
who
are
not
the
boys
arrived
one
by
one
they
crept
under
the
house
one
by
one
they
looked
into
the
blackness
of
the
hole
and
one
by
one
they
drew
back
again
their
eyes
glared
and
they
soon
became
members
of
the
back
row
of
spectators
then
henry
matthews
came
up
he
rode
into
the
edge
of
the
crowd
on
his
bicycle
upon
which
he
carried
clothes
for
a
tailor
to
support
his
widowed
mother
the
matter
he
inquired
meekly
some
one
broke
the
uncanny
quietness
for
a
moment
and
told
him
another
kid
try
him
whispered
a
man
to
the
rescuers
who
had
grown
despondent
henry
walked
forward
they
told
him
what
it
meant
to
go
headfirst
for
perhaps
twenty
or
thirty
feet
downward
me
down
said
the
frail
boy
quietly
his
feet
were
securely
tied
with
a
heavy
rope
an
electric
light
with
an
extension
cord
was
placed
in
his
hand
the
boy
gazed
slowly
about
the
peering
faces
and
shoved
his
pale
face
into
the
blackness
down
he
went
inch
by
inch
and
then
foot
by
foot
the
rope
disappeared
behind
him
for
one
yard
two
yards
then
three
four
five
and
six
yards
he
was
still
going
down
and
the
light
had
disappeared
in
the
blackness
the
rope
must
have
gone
forty
feet
thought
the
men
at
the
other
end
of
the
line
then
came
the
faint
command
from
down
in
the
ground
the
men
at
the
other
end
smiled
with
eagerness
as
they
carefully
drew
on
the
line
then
they
looked
at
each
other
in
excited
expectation
for
the
load
on
the
rope
was
heavier
than
when
harry
descended
ten
feet
of
the
rope
had
been
pulled
to
the
surface
when
the
faces
changed
their
eyes
again
filled
with
fright
quickly
they
drew
on
the
line
and
soon
henry
his
body
covered
with
mud
sticks
and
rubbish
appeared
alone
they
gave
him
water
fanned
him
for
a
second
and
his
pale
face
began
to
show
faint
color
again
then
he
spoke
pulled
him
about
ten
feet
he
panted
his
hands
his
hands
were
so
slick
the
mud
came
off
and
he
dropped
back
he
was
on
some
sticks
sticks
caught
in
the
well
when
i
found
him
afraid
he
fell
back
through
them
if
he
did
we
get
mother
fainted
and
was
carried
away
other
women
screamed
and
rushed
about
blindly
voice
was
getting
fainter
old
men
cried
men
whose
hearts
had
faced
everything
from
the
trials
of
the
civil
war
to
modern
troubles
me
down
again
said
the
brave
young
rescuer
as
he
rubbed
his
face
as
if
to
awaken
to
his
undertaking
again
his
face
disappeared
then
his
body
and
then
his
feet
on
and
on
he
went
down
feet
of
the
grass
rope
had
disappeared
when
the
order
to
was
heard
far
off
anxiously
and
with
less
hope
than
before
the
men
pulled
the
line
was
heavier
as
they
pulled
foot
after
foot
above
the
surface
the
crying
of
a
baby
was
heard
down
in
the
ground
the
larger
feet
appeared
at
the
top
then
his
body
and
then
his
face
then
little
bennie
clasped
by
each
wrist
by
a
pair
of
muddy
hands
appeared
on
earth
again
the
women
screamed
and
cried
for
the
hundredth
time
that
morning
the
men
or
rather
most
of
them
wept
and
then
cheered
now
everybody
cheered
and
hundreds
of
voices
let
everybody
within
a
block
know
that
the
boy
was
in
his
arms
they
also
let
those
about
know
that
henry
had
emerged
from
beneath
the
house
with
eyes
hair
hands
and
clothing
covered
with
mud
they
grabbed
him
women
kissed
him
and
men
crowded
about
the
boy
got
time
to
stop
now
said
henry
to
get
back
to
the
and
he
hurriedly
washed
the
dirt
from
his
face
but
they
let
him
go
they
surged
about
the
wondering
lad
and
held
him
for
a
while
or
at
least
until
the
praising
crowds
could
press
fifty
dollars
into
his
little
hands
then
he
turned
jumped
upon
his
bicycle
and
rode
speedily
away
to
deliver
the
clothes
for
the
tailor
for
the
support
of
himself
and
his
widowed
mother
two
years
on
their
honeymoon
walk
journeys
across
the
continent
twice
on
foot
within
a
period
of
two
years
marked
the
unique
honeymoon
trip
taken
by
and
john
broxman
of
near
harrisburg
who
arrived
in
baltimore
a
few
days
ago
and
who
for
just
two
hours
were
the
guests
of
webber
wife
of
the
pastor
of
the
emmanuel
evangelical
church
greene
street
near
lombard
in
the
months
that
they
have
been
away
the
young
married
couple
have
traversed
the
parched
sands
of
the
semitropical
countries
of
the
south
the
fertile
valleys
of
the
middle
west
and
the
rugged
mountain
paths
of
the
far
western
states
they
are
happy
and
have
returned
to
their
homes
without
reporting
a
mishap
in
making
their
long
journey
on
foot
and
broxman
have
won
both
fame
and
fortune
for
not
only
were
they
cordially
welcomed
in
all
the
towns
and
cities
through
which
they
passed
but
as
the
result
of
their
long
hike
they
have
been
presented
with
a
huge
sum
of
money
by
a
of
broxman
in
california
and
henceforth
they
will
make
their
home
on
a
farm
which
has
been
purchased
by
the
bridegroom
near
harrisburg
and
broxman
strolled
into
baltimore
unnoticed
and
sought
acquaintances
whom
they
had
known
years
ago
in
their
search
for
their
friends
they
drifted
into
the
neighborhood
of
greene
and
lombard
streets
and
dropped
into
the
parsonage
of
the
emmanuel
evangelical
church
in
order
to
get
directions
as
to
streets
and
house
numbers
webber
happened
to
be
at
home
and
invited
the
strangers
in
she
could
not
aid
them
in
their
quest
for
the
baltimore
friends
but
she
did
entertain
them
the
greater
part
of
the
afternoon
and
while
enjoying
the
hospitality
of
her
home
the
young
people
told
of
their
unique
honeymoon
trip
and
broxman
were
married
two
years
ago
and
had
planned
to
spend
their
honeymoon
quietly
in
the
east
but
in
santa
ana
told
them
that
he
would
present
them
with
a
substantial
sum
of
money
if
they
would
take
as
their
honeymoon
trip
a
from
harrisburg
to
california
and
back
again
they
decided
to
try
and
win
the
prize
held
out
to
them
so
immediately
after
the
wedding
ceremony
was
performed
they
started
on
their
long
hike
from
baltimore
the
young
couple
went
to
harrisburg
dogs
have
acquired
the
art
of
speech
in
a
previous
issue
we
briefly
described
a
dog
named
woodrow
wilson
that
was
said
to
be
able
to
utter
sounds
which
distinctly
resemble
words
the
dog
is
a
bull
terrier
and
was
named
woodrow
wilson
because
on
the
day
of
president
inauguration
he
wandered
into
the
home
of
miss
rose
bonn
of
scottsdale
his
present
owner
he
does
such
feats
in
that
he
is
the
wonder
of
the
town
he
answers
questions
promptly
and
correctly
for
instance
when
he
is
asked
do
you
love
he
promptly
replies
woodrow
wilson
may
be
a
remarkable
dog
but
there
have
been
other
talking
dogs
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
public
during
the
last
decade
says
a
writer
who
has
made
note
of
them
there
was
cutey
did
you
ever
hear
of
her
well
her
owner
was
positive
she
could
speak
and
many
of
his
friends
were
willing
to
corroborate
his
enthusiastic
statements
ability
as
a
talking
dog
was
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
public
in
a
peculiar
way
a
small
boy
was
playing
with
a
ball
in
east
fourteenth
street
new
york
one
afternoon
when
a
fox
terrier
strolled
along
and
stopped
to
watch
the
boy
greatly
to
the
astonishment
the
dog
suddenly
said
want
my
it
did
not
take
long
for
the
boy
to
spread
the
news
about
the
talking
dog
and
finally
it
reached
the
newspapers
a
reporter
was
sent
to
see
the
owner
of
the
dog
fred
jackson
of
east
fourteenth
street
although
the
reporter
was
skeptical
when
he
entered
home
he
emerged
convinced
that
if
the
dog
did
not
speak
she
made
a
pretty
good
attempt
it
took
owner
three
months
to
teach
her
how
to
say
want
my
he
got
the
idea
from
observing
the
dog
trying
to
repeat
things
that
were
said
to
her
it
was
also
asserted
by
neighbors
that
cutey
was
able
to
say
will
and
night
a
dog
named
rolf
attracted
much
attention
in
berlin
because
of
his
power
to
utter
sounds
which
could
be
distinguished
as
words
this
dog
not
only
could
speak
but
he
could
spell
in
fact
he
attracted
so
much
attention
that
professor
claparede
of
the
department
of
experimental
psychology
of
the
university
of
geneva
examined
the
dog
and
pronounced
him
a
wonder
the
professor
in
order
to
avoid
collusion
between
the
dog
and
his
mistress
brought
a
set
of
pictures
along
with
him
which
the
dog
had
never
seen
one
of
the
pictures
showed
four
mice
nibbling
at
cheese
without
any
hesitation
the
dog
spelled
out
words
which
convinced
professor
claparede
that
rolf
knew
what
the
picture
was
not
long
ago
the
police
of
philadelphia
made
what
they
considered
an
important
capture
in
the
form
of
a
dog
who
was
in
league
with
a
band
of
thieves
while
this
animal
did
some
petty
thieving
on
his
own
account
he
was
valuable
to
the
thieves
because
of
his
ability
to
to
them
whenever
he
saw
policemen
approaching
his
consisted
of
short
barks
which
the
thieves
understood
perfectly
although
the
police
were
suspicious
of
the
owners
of
the
dog
they
could
never
catch
them
in
the
act
finally
it
dawned
on
them
that
the
dog
had
been
trained
to
run
up
and
down
before
places
which
were
being
robbed
the
police
then
decided
to
watch
the
dog
and
swooping
down
suddenly
one
night
on
the
they
caught
the
thieves
at
work
there
lived
in
cranford
a
dog
which
could
not
only
but
read
a
newspaper
as
well
the
dog
whose
name
was
throgs
was
the
property
of
miss
alice
lakey
of
the
new
jersey
state
food
commission
and
had
the
regular
job
of
going
to
the
newspaper
store
every
morning
for
the
family
paper
he
carried
the
coin
wrapped
up
in
a
paper
gave
it
to
the
news
dealer
got
his
paper
and
returned
home
with
it
in
his
mouth
one
morning
the
regular
news
dealer
was
not
present
at
the
stand
but
another
person
in
the
store
slipped
a
paper
into
mouth
the
dog
walked
slowly
out
of
the
store
to
the
other
side
of
the
street
where
he
dropped
the
paper
and
then
thoroughly
scrutinized
it
convinced
that
it
was
not
the
paper
he
was
in
the
habit
of
getting
he
sat
down
and
waited
until
the
news
dealer
returned
then
he
walked
back
to
the
store
got
his
regular
paper
and
trotted
home

it

while

the
only
ones
that

be
considered
they
are
not
overdrawn
tales
of

they
rather
show
the
working
of
one
of
the
finest
minds
ever
conceived
by
a
writer

of
nick

is
familiar

no

so
well
as
