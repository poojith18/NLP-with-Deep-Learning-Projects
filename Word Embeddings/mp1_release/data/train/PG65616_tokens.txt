so
all
the
guests
had
quitted
dundargue
now
but
hawke
holcroft
in
two
days
he
was
to
depart
for
what
he
called
chambers
in
town
thus
allan
was
compelled
to
continue
his
polite
dissimulation
and
be
on
suave
and
apparently
easy
terms
with
him
as
a
guest
though
the
latter
felt
that
there
was
an
undefinable
change
in
his
manner
towards
him
indeed
it
was
only
by
a
great
effort
of
that
the
master
of
aberfeldie
a
man
with
the
highest
and
keenest
sense
of
honour
and
knowing
all
he
did
continued
to
treat
holcroft
with
politeness
but
he
writhed
and
shivered
when
he
heard
him
in
the
or
elsewhere
address
olive
or
eveline
all
the
forenoon
after
cameron
departure
when
poor
little
eveline
was
most
triste
and
miserable
our
other
pair
of
lovers
were
very
happy
they
had
what
they
were
pleased
to
call
picnic
on
the
of
dundargue
allan
portion
thereof
was
cigars
and
olive
a
little
basket
of
purple
grapes
and
luscious
strawberries
though
the
season
was
autumn
from
the
hothouses
so
with
these
two
the
hours
passed
sweetly
and
swiftly
with
the
blue
sky
overhead
while
far
away
in
the
distance
and
steeped
in
sunny
haze
stretched
the
lovely
carse
of
gowrie
and
talking
of
themselves
their
past
folly
their
present
joy
and
the
brilliant
future
that
was
to
come
they
billed
and
cooed
after
the
fashion
of
all
lovers
since
flowers
grew
in
eden
allan
lolled
at
length
on
the
stone
bartizan
of
the
tower
whence
molten
lead
and
arrows
had
more
than
once
been
launched
on
a
foe
beneath
olive
with
her
fair
head
reclined
against
his
shoulder
toying
with
her
fruit
while
he
did
so
with
her
silky
hair
or
kissed
her
lips
and
hands
and
called
her
all
manner
of
funny
and
endearing
names
that
would
look
rather
odd
in
print
and
yet
amid
their
present
happiness
it
was
strange
that
each
wondered
more
than
once
if
coldness
or
estrangement
would
ever
come
between
them
again
never
oh
never
complained
that
the
gardeners
saw
me
kissing
you
in
the
rosery
yesterday
olive
said
allan
little
woman
who
should
i
kiss
if
i
do
kiss
you
well
only
the
crows
overhead
can
see
us
up
here
at
all
events
but
now
as
he
toyed
with
her
hands
marvelling
as
he
did
so
at
their
whiteness
and
beauty
and
anon
played
with
the
bangles
that
encircled
her
rounded
arms
he
bethought
of
the
one
worn
yes
actually
worn
by
holcroft
and
silently
he
resolved
to
possess
himself
of
it
without
delay
so
ere
the
bell
rang
for
luncheon
he
made
an
excuse
conducted
his
cousin
with
many
a
pause
and
long
delay
which
were
not
idly
spent
down
the
dark
and
winding
staircase
from
the
head
of
the
tower
in
his
happiness
until
now
he
had
forgotten
all
about
the
bangle
which
perhaps
for
some
ulterior
purpose
of
his
own
holcroft
seemed
to
have
quietly
appropriated
and
by
whom
he
wished
it
returned
without
any
fuss
or
explanation
to
this
end
he
sought
that
personage
after
luncheon
was
over
and
was
sure
he
would
find
him
either
practising
strokes
in
the
in
the
or
stables
watching
the
horses
and
catching
hints
from
the
grooms
he
found
him
in
the
place
cue
in
hand
for
a
game
said
he
thanks
cameron
and
everyone
is
gone
i
reduced
to
playing
the
right
hand
against
the
left
while
playing
i
perceive
that
you
have
a
gold
bangle
of
miss
raymond
on
your
left
wrist
replied
holcroft
leisurely
allan
thought
impertinently
she
give
it
to
you
do
you
ask
she
give
it
to
you
repeated
allan
with
a
dangerous
gleam
in
his
dark
eyes
comes
it
to
be
there
then
take
to
high
falutin
i
slipped
it
on
in
mere
fun
and
it
will
not
come
off
again
allow
me
and
allan
in
a
moment
by
twisting
the
ductile
indian
gold
wrenched
it
off
and
holcroft
eyes
had
a
malevolent
flash
in
them
as
he
stooped
to
strike
a
ball
said
allan
pocketing
the
bangle
we
shall
have
a
cigar
for
a
moment
he
felt
a
little
ashamed
of
his
sudden
irritation
and
proffered
his
to
holcroft
who
smiled
his
thanks
and
accepted
a
havana
the
master
was
younger
and
handsomer
than
he
the
heir
to
an
ancient
title
and
estate
he
had
the
envied
prestige
of
having
borne
himself
bravely
when
under
fire
with
the
black
watch
and
had
a
goodly
crop
of
medals
not
so
many
as
my
lord
wolseley
of
course
but
still
when
in
uniform
a
goodly
display
he
had
all
the
advantages
over
hawke
holcroft
that
one
man
could
have
over
another
and
in
his
heart
of
hearts
the
other
hated
yea
with
a
bitter
and
deadly
hate
allan
graham
a
hate
beyond
his
love
real
or
supposed
for
olive
raymond
natheless
all
olive
beauty
and
her
money
his
chief
lure
and
incentive
while
conversing
and
joking
together
in
the
or
on
the
terrace
amid
the
pleasures
of
the
table
knocking
the
balls
about
at
billiards
or
so
forth
how
little
could
the
unconscious
allan
have
dreamed
that
his
father
guest
the
son
of
his
old
friend
had
been
pondering
over
the
art
of
no
murder
of
accidents
brought
about
in
the
at
cover
shooting
or
even
of
dynamite
cigars
had
he
not
heard
of
such
things
at
monaco
homburg
and
elsewhere
he
knew
that
there
was
quite
a
manufactory
of
such
cigars
at
temeswar
in
austria
but
wherever
were
such
pleasant
gifts
be
obtained
in
an
hole
like
the
carse
of
gowrie
his
teeth
under
his
moustache
glittered
or
glistened
whitely
when
such
ideas
occurred
to
him
though
he
chatted
away
with
perhaps
forced
and
gaiety
under
all
his
assumed
ease
of
manner
there
smouldered
a
glow
mingled
hate
of
allan
and
coveting
of
olive
but
with
an
emotion
of
a
much
coarser
nature
combined
with
greed
seeing
clairette
olive
maid
passing
allan
made
up
the
bangle
in
a
little
packet
as
he
still
wished
no
more
explanations
on
the
subject
and
desired
her
to
give
it
to
her
mistress
and
miss
raymond
seem
exceedingly
good
friends
now
said
holcroft
were
never
otherwise
replied
allan
curtly
and
displeased
by
the
remark
a
prize
in
matrimony
such
a
girl
must
be
with
so
much
beauty
and
wealth
is
sometimes
a
misfortune
for
a
girl
to
be
rich
or
to
be
thought
so
said
allan
she
may
become
the
prey
of
some
needy
or
enterprising
scamp
holcroft
winced
at
the
reply
though
it
was
made
casually
and
without
the
least
design
by
allan
in
marrying
miss
raymond
might
perhaps
be
poor
enough
paradox
is
this
asked
holcroft
thoroughly
interested
while
allan
felt
some
disdain
at
discussing
such
matters
with
such
a
man
poor
as
a
church
mouse
unless
what
marries
replied
allan
who
with
perhaps
pardonable
pique
only
thought
of
provoking
a
man
who
had
tried
to
rival
him
and
whom
he
deemed
a
needy
and
adventurous
gambler
this
seemed
only
to
corroborate
what
holcroft
had
heard
before
and
gave
him
some
occasion
for
thought
have
heard
rumours
of
a
family
compact
a
most
fortunate
one
for
you
said
he
smiling
suppose
you
excuse
me
for
saying
so
were
to
predecease
her
my
pretty
cousin
would
be
a
free
woman
but
i
do
mean
to
die
yet
awhile
let
us
take
a
turn
before
dinner
he
added
to
change
the
conversation
he
had
no
desire
to
continue
you
like
but
as
the
evening
has
become
chill
suppose
we
smoke
our
cigars
in
the
right
i
am
your
man
had
allan
looked
at
hawke
holcroft
just
then
he
might
have
perceived
a
lurid
gleam
in
his
stealthy
eyes
and
how
his
hands
were
clenched
till
the
nails
of
his
fingers
bruised
the
palms
thereof
olive
received
her
bangle
and
though
startled
by
the
abruptness
with
which
it
was
returned
without
message
or
explanation
from
allan
as
clairette
told
her
she
thought
less
of
the
circumstance
then
than
she
did
a
day
or
two
after
dinner
was
announced
holcroft
appeared
in
accurate
evening
dress
as
usual
and
after
waiting
a
few
minutes
for
allan
who
did
not
appear
the
meal
was
proceeded
with
in
the
slow
fashion
peculiar
to
dundargue
though
only
five
were
seated
at
table
ere
dessert
came
lady
aberfeldie
dispatched
a
servant
to
room
in
search
of
him
he
was
not
there
though
his
evening
dress
was
laid
out
as
usual
can
he
be
where
can
he
have
gone
were
the
queries
on
all
hands
which
as
night
began
to
draw
on
without
his
appearing
took
the
form
of
alarm
what
can
have
happened
allan
drop
hints
of
going
anywhere
asked
lord
aberfeldie
all
answered
is
most
mysterious
still
more
mysterious
did
it
appear
when
the
night
passed
without
his
being
seen
and
when
his
place
was
still
vacant
at
the
next
day
lord
aberfeldie
was
in
dire
perplexity
the
ladies
were
pale
and
already
betook
themselves
to
tears
allan
has
left
the
house
as
suddenly
as
he
did
before
he
has
taken
neither
clothes
nor
portmanteau
with
him
as
tappleton
assures
me
so
what
can
it
mean
exclaimed
lord
aberfeldie
a
gun
was
missing
from
the
could
allan
have
gone
to
shoot
with
logan
at
loganlee
but
olive
deemed
it
impossible
that
he
would
do
so
without
consulting
her
and
on
looking
at
holcroft
she
thought
he
looked
rather
hot
and
disturbed
bangle
the
bangle
thought
the
girl
with
sudden
terror
he
have
gone
in
a
fit
of
jealousy
mercy
if
it
should
be
so
inquiries
proved
that
allan
had
not
passed
out
by
the
entrance
gates
as
the
affirmed
and
no
trace
of
footsteps
could
be
found
at
any
of
the
private
gates
to
the
grounds
and
it
was
soon
discovered
that
he
had
not
taken
a
ticket
for
any
place
at
the
railway
station
what
terrible
mystery
was
here
the
family
began
to
look
with
growing
alarm
and
dismay
blankly
into
each
other
pale
faces
keepers
and
gillies
strong
active
and
fellows
hector
alister
bain
angus
and
dugal
glas
even
old
ronald
gair
the
piper
searched
but
in
vain
the
grounds
plantations
even
the
adjacent
hills
and
glens
but
not
a
trace
was
found
of
the
missing
allan
he
seemed
suddenly
to
have
dropped
out
of
existence
as
this
his
last
day
at
dundargue
drew
on
none
made
himself
more
active
in
searching
and
riding
about
the
roads
than
holcroft
and
so
preoccupied
were
all
that
no
one
even
olive
noticed
that
his
face
was
pale
and
cadaverous
and
wore
a
very
disturbed
expression
and
that
his
pale
eyes
seemed
to
glare
defiantly
if
anyone
looked
at
him
while
he
sedulously
kept
his
hand
how
are
we
to
relate
all
that
really
had
happened
chapter
ii
a
modern
use
for
a
mediæval
institution
world
is
not
a
bad
world
after
all
said
allan
as
he
and
holcroft
after
a
casual
glance
at
the
long
lines
of
portraits
panelled
in
the
wainscotting
of
the
gallery
together
with
many
a
cuyp
zucchero
canaletti
and
so
forth
now
looked
out
from
one
of
the
lofty
windows
upon
the
fair
domain
of
his
family
that
spread
for
miles
around
dundargue
is
easy
enough
for
you
to
talk
thus
of
the
world
thought
holcroft
if
like
me
you
had
only
debts
and
difficulties
for
your
patrimony
you
might
take
a
different
view
was
born
here
in
dundargue
and
all
the
happy
memories
of
my
childhood
centre
round
it
said
allan
man
woman
and
child
in
the
place
are
known
to
me
every
rock
and
hill
glen
and
woodland
familiar
with
all
their
stories
and
traditions
and
wherever
i
might
be
with
the
black
watch
in
england
on
the
staff
far
away
in
central
india
or
in
the
gorges
of
afghanistan
my
memory
always
fled
home
to
dear
old
dundargue
and
all
its
surroundings
pathetic
sneered
holcroft
silently
and
puzzled
to
understand
the
mood
of
allan
who
in
the
consciousness
of
his
own
happiness
with
olive
felt
at
that
moment
rather
inclined
to
take
a
soft
and
generous
view
of
the
world
at
large
certainly
is
a
fine
old
ancestral
house
one
to
be
proud
of
said
holcroft
aloud
a
special
history
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
i
have
heard
a
devil
of
a
deal
about
its
oubliette
where
is
it
me
show
you
come
this
way
said
allan
lighting
a
fresh
cigar
smoking
together
allan
and
holcroft
following
wandered
up
and
down
circular
stone
stairs
in
narrow
turrets
where
the
steps
had
been
worn
and
hollowed
by
the
feet
of
long
departed
generations
through
dusky
corridors
where
in
some
places
arras
hung
upon
its
rusty
and
where
as
holcroft
said
there
was
loud
smell
of
mice
through
secret
doors
and
past
priest
hole
in
which
james
of
jerusalem
abode
till
they
reached
a
narrow
stone
passage
near
the
summit
of
the
great
tower
closed
by
a
massive
little
door
allan
threw
this
open
and
the
black
round
mouth
of
the
oubliette
about
four
feet
in
diameter
yawned
before
them
the
great
horizontal
stone
slab
or
flagstone
which
in
ancient
times
had
closed
the
mouth
of
this
horrible
accessory
to
feudal
tyranny
had
long
since
given
place
to
a
massive
of
oak
which
was
held
up
by
a
wooden
prop
under
which
the
cold
dark
vault
showed
its
mysterious
profundity
jove
it
is
a
strange
affair
more
like
a
than
anything
else
supposed
to
be
twelve
feet
diameter
at
the
bottom
a
fine
old
relic
of
the
days
when
warriors
bold
wore
spurs
of
gold
and
the
rack
and
the
ploughshare
were
aids
to
the
orthodox
opinions
of
society
in
religion
and
politics
and
allan
laughed
as
he
spoke
foetid
its
atmosphere
is
that
door
has
not
been
open
for
an
age
and
may
be
closed
for
as
long
again
no
one
ever
comes
here
peering
downward
as
if
into
a
well
they
saw
the
outlines
of
their
heads
reflected
in
a
little
pool
of
water
at
the
bottom
but
how
far
down
it
was
impossible
to
say
upon
a
time
said
allan
parts
of
the
carse
of
gowrie
were
under
water
in
wet
seasons
especially
it
flowed
in
here
how
no
one
knew
unless
through
fissures
in
the
rock
and
drowned
like
a
rat
any
luckless
wight
who
was
thrown
in
to
be
to
be
so
the
phrase
went
then
hence
its
name
do
you
mean
to
say
that
no
one
who
was
dropped
into
that
confounded
hole
ever
came
up
again
their
cries
not
heard
the
walls
around
are
so
thick
and
the
bottom
is
in
the
living
rock
on
which
dundargue
stands
jove
exclaimed
holcroft
again
as
if
perplexed
so
much
so
that
he
had
let
his
cigar
grow
cold
their
bones
he
asked
after
a
pause
found
in
quantities
by
certain
explorers
who
went
down
with
torches
some
years
ago
i
have
not
looked
into
this
place
for
years
not
since
i
left
for
the
regiment
in
india
said
allan
stooping
somewhat
dangerously
and
to
holcroft
sudden
idea
somewhat
temptingly
over
the
dangerous
profundity
into
which
he
was
striving
to
peer
with
all
the
rapidity
of
light
many
terrible
thoughts
now
crowded
into
the
mind
of
holcroft
he
hated
allan
graham
with
deadly
rivalry
and
hate
combined
never
again
in
the
desperation
of
his
affairs
might
he
have
the
chance
of
an
introduction
to
such
a
prize
as
olive
raymond
or
be
on
such
a
footing
as
he
had
recently
found
himself
with
her
he
loathed
allan
for
all
allan
possessed
and
as
we
are
told
coward
who
knows
himself
to
be
at
once
despised
but
unchastised
for
a
woman
sake
can
hate
if
he
lost
his
chances
with
olive
beggary
stared
him
in
the
face
drops
of
perspiration
started
to
his
forehead
and
chance
now
confirmed
his
diabolical
resolution
the
gloomy
fiend
was
uppermost
his
revenge
and
perhaps
future
triumph
stood
embodied
before
him
he
did
not
pause
and
all
these
dire
thoughts
occurred
to
him
in
less
than
the
space
of
one
vibration
of
a
pendulum
had
the
master
of
aberfeldie
turned
sharply
round
he
might
have
read
in
holcroft
white
face
an
expression
that
was
not
pleasant
to
look
upon
just
then
the
face
of
one
that
would
work
him
mischief
if
he
could
but
the
unwitting
allan
was
doing
what
he
had
not
done
since
boyhood
he
was
peering
with
vague
curiosity
into
the
profundity
below
a
fury
a
clamorous
anxiety
seemed
to
blaze
up
in
the
heart
and
brain
of
holcroft
who
was
a
practised
and
he
suddenly
gave
allan
an
awful
blow
under
the
left
ear
a
blow
hit
right
out
from
the
shoulder
that
shot
him
headlong
into
the
vault
he
vanished
from
the
light
there
was
a
heavy
thud
far
down
below
and
then
all
became
still
unnaturally
so
but
holcroft
could
hear
the
beating
of
his
own
pulses
while
the
blood
seemed
to
be
surging
about
his
throbbing
temples
was
he
acting
in
a
dream
from
which
he
would
waken
to
find
himself
in
bed
or
was
all
this
happening
not
to
him
but
to
some
one
else
no
there
was
the
bruised
right
hand
from
which
the
violence
of
his
blow
had
torn
the
skin
he
had
read
of
dark
crimes
of
but
little
did
he
think
he
would
ever
become
the
participator
in
such
a
deed
but
opportunity
is
always
the
devil
game
for
a
minute
an
eternity
it
seemed
by
the
chaos
of
his
mind
the
sudden
inversion
of
all
thought
he
did
not
breathe
he
scarcely
seemed
to
live
there
was
a
whisper
of
on
his
lips
and
it
seemed
to
have
an
echo
that
terrible
whisper
but
whether
from
the
walls
the
trees
that
waved
below
them
the
blue
sky
or
the
crows
that
were
winging
their
way
through
it
he
knew
not
he
seemed
to
whisper
the
awful
word
to
himself
with
quivering
lips
again
and
again
as
if
he
required
an
assurance
of
its
truth
and
then
sought
to
rouse
himself
from
his
lethargic
stupor
quit
the
scene
of
his
sudden
crime
and
seek
safety
in
flight
flight
but
then
to
quit
dundargue
thus
would
fix
suspicion
on
himself
had
not
clairette
the
french
maid
seen
him
but
lately
with
allan
and
flight
would
mar
the
very
object
for
which
he
had
committed
the
crime
should
he
could
he
at
all
risks
to
himself
and
his
fortune
ere
it
was
too
late
strive
to
undo
what
he
had
done
to
give
an
alarm
and
make
some
excuse
or
explanation
ere
life
had
departed
from
the
shattered
frame
of
his
victim
or
leave
the
latter
to
his
obscure
fate
a
grave
under
his
father
roof
cowardice
and
meanness
hatred
jealousy
and
avarice
all
suggested
the
latter
he
knew
not
the
depth
of
this
strange
prison
or
how
far
down
beneath
the
foundations
of
lofty
dundargue
and
into
the
rock
on
which
it
stands
the
sill
or
floor
of
the
noisome
vault
might
be
he
listened
not
a
sound
came
upward
nor
was
there
any
save
the
wild
beating
of
his
own
heart
and
the
buzzing
and
singing
of
blood
in
his
ears
he
softly
closed
the
wooden
let
the
enormous
iron
hasp
thereof
drop
over
the
rusty
staple
he
closed
the
massive
external
entrance
and
stealthily
crept
or
glided
away
there
seemed
a
silence
all
around
him
now
such
a
silence
as
must
have
appalled
the
soul
of
the
first
murderer
when
he
up
against
abel
his
brother
and
slew
him
so
the
tragedy
the
dark
crime
was
acted
as
suddenly
as
it
was
weird
suggested
by
a
whisper
of
the
devil
there
was
nothing
very
tragic
in
the
accessories
of
the
scene
but
as
an
author
says
not
real
tragedies
the
social
tragedies
that
go
on
about
us
in
our
life
enacted
like
comedies
until
the
last
moment
when
the
curtain
falls
and
all
is
dark
pale
as
death
in
visage
he
felt
himself
to
be
so
stealthy
in
step
and
eye
he
stole
away
to
his
own
apartment
in
a
modern
part
of
the
mansion
how
he
reached
it
he
never
knew
but
mechanically
of
course
and
he
blessed
his
stars
that
he
reached
it
unseen
he
took
a
long
pull
at
the
brandy
flask
tore
off
his
collar
and
necktie
and
cast
himself
half
fainting
on
his
bed
where
he
lay
panting
and
gasping
heavily
every
sound
that
came
to
his
ear
every
step
that
approached
seemed
to
hawke
holcroft
the
herald
of
discovery
and
he
longed
with
the
most
intense
nervous
intensity
to
leave
this
loathed
dundargue
behind
him
was
the
master
dying
there
or
dead
outright
where
he
lay
no
sound
could
ever
reach
the
external
air
but
had
not
his
victim
assured
him
that
no
cry
could
ever
come
from
there
the
place
was
so
deep
so
remote
would
the
next
evening
when
he
was
to
depart
never
come
then
he
had
the
meals
the
family
and
their
surmises
to
face
he
had
a
haggard
and
hunted
look
that
evening
and
all
next
day
which
lord
aberfeldie
in
the
kindness
of
his
heart
amid
all
his
own
new
anxiety
attributed
to
the
pressure
of
his
monetary
affairs
chapter
iii
holcroft
departs
it
was
a
considerable
relief
to
holcroft
mind
to
perceive
that
this
second
abrupt
disappearance
of
allan
excited
more
surprise
than
alarm
in
his
family
circle
and
in
her
own
thoughts
lady
aberfeldie
secretly
connected
it
with
some
lovers
quarrel
between
him
and
olive
it
was
so
like
their
past
relations
that
some
such
folly
should
intervene
the
bell
for
dinner
sounded
much
earlier
than
usual
as
holcroft
was
to
depart
for
the
south
that
evening
and
to
see
him
in
the
dressed
in
black
with
spotless
and
diamond
studs
with
tie
and
collar
perfect
his
hair
brushed
with
precision
and
the
ends
of
his
tawny
moustache
waxed
out
to
sharp
points
who
could
have
imagined
him
an
actor
in
that
scene
in
the
distant
arched
passage
or
connected
him
with
what
was
lying
at
the
bottom
of
that
deep
dark
oubliette
holcroft
always
thought
that
great
games
involved
serious
hazards
but
now
this
was
a
hazard
beyond
all
his
previous
calculations
the
greatest
chance
of
fortune
he
had
ever
seen
in
his
varied
life
seemed
to
be
slipping
or
to
have
speedily
slipped
away
from
him
when
olive
raymond
and
her
cousin
suddenly
appeared
on
such
amicable
terms
savage
emotions
of
mingled
disappointment
and
revenge
filled
his
heart
and
certainly
he
had
given
full
swing
to
them
now
what
he
had
done
was
over
the
rubicon
had
been
passed
he
was
what
he
dared
not
name
himself
the
thought
of
all
that
allan
graham
must
endure
ere
he
died
if
he
was
not
already
dead
was
at
times
but
at
times
only
maddening
even
to
his
destroyer
and
he
felt
that
he
could
not
too
soon
place
miles
upon
miles
between
himself
and
dundargue
and
that
happen
what
might
he
would
never
set
foot
in
dundargue
again
seated
at
that
luxurious
table
with
the
hospitable
father
the
mother
the
tender
sister
and
brilliant
of
him
he
had
slain
with
valets
in
attendance
while
longing
for
the
conveyance
or
carriage
that
was
to
take
him
to
the
station
he
feel
more
than
once
as
if
he
would
go
mad
if
it
lasted
much
longer
this
acting
this
tension
of
the
heart
but
as
we
say
for
a
time
only
he
was
too
near
the
scene
of
his
awful
crime
not
to
feel
his
soul
shrink
with
selfish
horror
and
dismay
which
made
him
nervously
twist
up
roll
and
unroll
his
as
it
is
called
in
scotland
was
it
only
a
few
hours
since
he
had
heard
that
terrible
amid
the
darkness
and
the
clash
of
the
oak
and
there
were
family
all
seated
with
him
holcroft
at
the
same
table
all
unconscious
of
what
was
lying
within
a
few
yards
of
them
and
yet
not
considering
him
the
blackest
criminal
in
the
world
but
a
departing
guest
to
be
treated
with
kindness
and
courtesy
thank
heaven
he
would
be
far
away
from
them
ere
allan
would
be
found
to
be
hopelessly
gone
and
he
would
see
nothing
of
their
growing
misery
to
drown
thought
care
and
memory
holcroft
after
the
ladies
retired
to
the
imbibed
systematically
more
than
usual
ere
this
olive
had
thought
his
manner
excited
strange
only
unused
to
see
men
under
the
influence
of
wine
she
thought
no
more
of
it
but
as
holcroft
took
to
his
clicquot
with
brandy
when
occasion
served
that
may
account
for
some
of
the
peculiar
remarks
to
olive
yet
to
be
recorded
from
an
early
period
eveline
had
conceived
a
shuddering
kind
of
aversion
of
holcroft
an
emotion
not
rare
in
certain
nervous
organisations
like
hers
nor
could
she
have
explained
why
more
particularly
his
presence
though
at
table
as
usual
had
filled
her
with
an
undefined
distrust
and
dread
yet
so
it
was
but
in
the
her
own
thoughts
came
more
than
ever
back
to
her
and
these
were
all
of
evan
cameron
is
gone
she
was
always
whispering
to
herself
probably
for
ever
and
for
ever
we
shall
never
meet
again
how
dull
my
world
will
seem
without
evan
and
how
old
and
queer
i
begin
to
feel
already
but
poor
eveline
knew
not
what
a
small
place
the
world
is
especially
seem
rather
out
of
sorts
said
lord
aberfeldie
who
had
been
eyeing
old
friend
son
while
pushing
the
decanters
towards
him
hope
there
is
nothing
wrong
with
you
especially
as
this
is
your
last
evening
here
nothing
very
wrong
stammered
holcroft
scarcely
knowing
what
to
say
but
driven
to
shelter
himself
under
what
was
his
normal
condition
is
only
only
have
had
more
than
one
annoying
letter
he
said
with
a
kind
of
gasp
and
paused
money
of
course
said
lord
aberfeldie
was
a
threat
from
a
tailor
replied
holcroft
making
a
terrible
effort
to
appear
facetious
says
if
i
do
pay
him
he
will
take
means
to
make
me
do
so
you
back
that
i
was
delighted
to
hear
he
had
the
means
as
this
was
more
than
i
had
my
dear
fellow
your
father
was
one
of
my
oldest
friends
for
his
sake
can
i
square
it
for
you
lord
aberfeldie
do
think
of
that
the
total
asked
the
other
opening
a
davenport
on
said
holcroft
with
an
effort
which
certainly
was
an
emotion
but
not
gratitude
holcroft
pay
me
when
you
can
or
choose
said
lord
aberfeldie
throwing
down
his
pen
closing
the
davenport
and
handing
a
cheque
for
the
sum
named
to
his
guest
to
stop
whose
thanks
he
plunged
at
once
into
the
inevitable
story
of
the
charge
of
the
black
watch
along
the
kourgané
hill
how
he
fell
wounded
and
how
but
for
holcroft
father
squad
of
infernal
russians
and
so
forth
glass
of
moët
and
then
we
shall
join
the
ladies
is
a
hard
game
with
some
of
us
now
said
holcroft
as
he
pocketed
his
cheque
some
one
has
written
men
can
not
go
freebooting
or
looting
now
except
in
business
and
it
is
quite
a
question
whether
a
modern
is
not
quite
as
respectable
a
member
of
society
as
a
riever
used
to
be
in
the
old
days
when
right
was
might
dundargue
was
built
added
lord
aberfeldie
laughing
did
not
say
so
but
you
thought
it
and
now
they
rose
from
the
table
holcroft
was
not
the
better
but
rather
the
worse
for
his
potations
he
had
eaten
little
and
drunk
much
thus
he
looked
very
pale
almost
ghastly
and
a
strange
fixed
grimness
replaced
occasionally
the
usual
restlessness
of
his
shifty
pale
eyes
and
freckled
face
curiously
enough
he
had
hovering
in
his
mind
a
kind
of
vengeance
just
then
at
olive
but
for
her
sudden
and
as
he
thought
capricious
preference
for
her
cousin
and
throwing
so
completely
over
the
deed
he
had
committed
would
never
have
been
done
eveline
had
withdrawn
to
her
room
whither
her
mother
had
followed
her
bent
on
worry
and
expostulation
no
doubt
lord
aberfeldie
was
required
by
his
steward
and
holcroft
found
olive
seated
alone
in
a
bay
window
of
the
watching
the
last
rays
of
the
sun
fading
out
behind
the
sidlaw
hills
hour
even
less
miss
raymond
and
my
place
here
will
be
vacant
said
he
in
a
low
and
unnatural
voice
while
attempting
to
hang
over
her
chair
in
his
old
fashion
got
back
my
bangle
thanks
said
she
a
little
irrelevantly
but
feeling
a
necessity
for
saying
something
you
forgotten
all
that
passed
between
us
before
and
after
you
allowed
me
to
retain
it
never
allowed
you
to
retain
it
nor
aught
of
mine
save
perhaps
a
bud
from
a
bouquet
i
have
not
forgotten
that
you
apparently
sought
to
do
me
a
great
honour
holcroft
but
i
scarcely
thought
even
then
that
you
were
serious
did
you
not
know
that
i
loved
you
better
than
my
own
life
can
not
listen
to
this
kind
of
thing
said
she
rising
with
positive
hauteur
and
annoyance
in
her
face
and
manner
forget
yourself
with
you
i
always
do
forgive
me
can
not
forgive
you
for
talking
to
me
thus
used
not
to
dislike
me
i
know
and
now
there
is
no
sacrifice
i
would
not
make
to
win
your
love
me
to
pass
exclaimed
olive
but
he
barred
her
way
and
now
a
glow
of
rage
seemed
to
possess
him
olive
raymond
said
he
in
a
low
concentrated
and
almost
fierce
tone
have
dared
and
risked
much
for
you
more
than
you
can
conceive
there
has
seldom
been
aught
that
i
have
sworn
to
possess
that
has
not
in
time
been
mine
mine
do
you
hear
to
those
who
wait
their
time
and
turn
always
come
i
have
sworn
to
possess
you
and
woe
to
the
man
who
comes
between
us
she
regarded
him
with
a
haughty
and
scared
yet
scornful
eye
she
saw
now
that
this
was
the
result
of
wine
you
think
you
could
compel
me
to
love
you
she
asked
with
a
provoking
smile
then
marry
me
what
pressure
sir
is
my
secret
time
you
may
find
it
out
he
added
bowing
to
her
with
ominous
not
mock
politeness
as
she
passed
him
with
a
haughty
stare
and
left
the
room
forgets
that
i
have
yet
her
photo
with
her
own
name
written
on
the
back
in
her
own
hand
and
if
ever
man
put
the
screw
on
a
woman
by
such
a
little
thing
as
that
i
shall
put
it
on
you
olive
raymond
if
you
continue
to
play
my
lady
disdain
to
me
and
for
a
moment
he
cast
after
her
retiring
figure
a
glance
of
sardonic
hate
a
devil
might
have
emulated
he
muttered
mockingly
an
unpleasant
thing
to
say
with
us
let
it
be
rather
perhaps
she
may
yet
wave
a
damp
from
the
outward
wall
as
i
ride
away
who
knows
to
say
time
is
up
my
dear
fellow
said
lord
aberfeldie
entering
the
room
with
his
hat
and
driving
gloves
your
adieux
to
the
ladies
there
is
little
doubt
that
allan
has
gone
to
loganlee
the
covers
are
there
i
just
drive
over
and
see
dropping
you
and
your
traps
at
the
railway
station
a
few
minutes
more
and
the
pair
were
tooling
down
the
avenue
in
a
smart
mail
phaeton
drawn
by
a
pair
of
fine
dark
greys
so
lord
aberfeldie
drove
son
of
his
oldest
friend
to
the
station
and
as
the
distance
increased
between
himself
and
dundargue
holcroft
spirits
revived
as
if
nothing
had
happened
there
at
all
he
actually
said
you
think
to
find
allan
at
loganlee
have
a
doubt
of
it
some
tift
with
olive
no
doubt
lord
aberfeldie
and
a
thousand
thanks
for
all
your
kindness
to
me
never
shall
forget
it
by
jove
but
i
shall
have
the
pleasure
of
seeing
you
all
again
in
town
of
course
to
this
expression
of
pleasure
lord
aberfeldie
made
no
response
but
shook
holcroft
hand
whipped
up
his
greys
and
was
off
thinking
am
glad
has
gone
he
looks
sadly
strange
and
queer
poor
fellow
holcroft
was
intensely
relieved
when
the
peer
had
left
and
making
straight
for
the
railway
buffet
imbibed
glass
after
glass
of
pretty
potent
glenlivat
conversing
affably
the
while
with
the
young
damsel
thereat
what
are
you
thinking
sir
that
you
stare
at
me
so
she
asked
with
a
giggle
that
your
mother
must
have
been
a
sweetly
pretty
girl
the
train
was
late
thus
he
had
to
spend
some
time
in
staring
aimlessly
at
the
flaming
advertisements
on
the
station
wall
an
fashion
now
spread
to
scotland
advertisements
of
some
one
cocoa
some
one
corsets
some
one
whisky
and
so
forth
and
after
glancing
with
a
contemptuous
malediction
at
the
thick
bible
left
by
the
scottish
something
society
in
the
little
he
smoked
a
cigar
had
himself
weighed
had
a
brandy
and
soda
had
some
more
chaff
with
the
pretty
girl
at
the
buffet
till
the
night
train
came
snorting
and
clanking
in
when
he
took
his
seat
spread
his
rugs
and
was
off
as
he
thought
to
security
at
last
though
he
was
not
without
reasonable
and
selfish
dread
for
the
future
as
the
night
train
sped
on
its
swift
way
and
left
the
carse
of
gowrie
far
behind
he
felt
no
genuine
compunction
for
the
atrocity
he
had
committed
he
did
not
possess
a
single
spark
of
honour
gratitude
compunction
or
compassion
by
unfair
play
he
had
rooked
many
he
had
hocussed
horses
and
once
ruined
a
poor
lad
in
the
lancers
on
whom
he
contrived
to
cast
the
suspicion
of
his
own
act
the
lancer
was
dismissed
the
service
by
sentence
of
a
and
shot
himself
next
day
and
hawke
holcroft
took
his
luxurious
luncheon
quietly
in
the
same
inn
where
the
inquest
was
held
at
the
same
time
he
had
extorted
money
in
many
ways
he
had
never
precisely
robbed
but
never
before
had
he
been
in
the
dark
abyss
of
assassination
and
death
till
now
the
annals
of
our
courts
of
justice
contain
many
a
terrible
tale
of
guilt
but
says
a
novelist
with
truth
these
would
appear
like
nothing
with
the
history
of
undiscovered
and
unpunished
crime
assassin
who
accomplishes
his
terrible
purpose
so
craftily
as
to
escape
detection
is
a
cool
and
calculating
fiend
by
the
side
of
whose
supreme
villainy
the
crime
of
the
ordinary
shedder
of
blood
is
dwarfed
into
insignificance
so
on
and
on
sped
the
swift
night
train
and
there
seemed
every
probability
that
the
deed
of
holcroft
would
be
one
of
the
crimes
referred
to
that
are
neither
discovered
nor
punished
he
gave
a
last
look
into
his
to
assure
himself
that
the
cheque
and
the
photo
of
olive
were
safe
and
then
tried
to
compose
himself
to
sleep
let
us
hope
that
the
attempt
was
vain
he
could
not
help
pondering
over
the
remark
of
allan
about
how
foetid
the
air
of
the
oubliette
was
that
the
door
had
not
been
opened
for
an
age
and
no
one
ever
thought
of
going
near
it
chapter
iv
suspense
lord
aberfeldie
drove
home
in
some
alarm
and
dismay
allan
was
not
at
loganlee
nor
had
he
been
near
it
when
ruby
the
little
beauty
heard
of
his
visit
and
its
object
she
was
not
slow
to
connect
allan
second
disappearance
with
some
lover
quarrel
between
him
and
olive
and
to
gather
certain
jealous
and
pleasant
hopes
therefrom
for
allan
was
decidedly
weakness
of
ruby
uncertainty
and
suspense
were
increasing
now
in
all
their
minute
horror
at
dundargue
while
surmises
proved
endless
futile
and
unavailing
he
was
gone
but
where
or
how
and
why
has
happened
something
fatal
to
my
son
wailed
lady
aberfeldie
me
back
those
fatal
diamonds
eveline
they
are
never
worn
that
sorrow
does
not
come
to
dundargue
courage
my
lady
said
old
tappleton
the
butler
news
aye
travels
fast
enough
and
if
ought
was
wrang
wi
the
master
we
should
hae
heard
ere
now
evan
cameron
now
with
his
regiment
and
the
legal
agents
of
the
family
at
edinburgh
were
alike
perplexed
on
the
receipt
of
letters
from
lord
aberfeldie
inquiring
anxiously
if
they
knew
anything
of
the
movements
of
allan
and
both
telegraphed
back
that
they
could
give
no
information
on
the
subject
with
these
telegrams
the
last
hope
passed
away
and
when
the
third
day
of
his
disappearance
began
to
close
a
kind
of
horror
seemed
to
settle
over
the
household
and
again
a
general
and
of
course
unavailing
search
was
made
through
the
entire
neighbourhood
on
the
face
of
the
servants
male
and
female
there
was
never
a
smile
now
as
they
all
loved
allan
well
it
was
no
assumed
expression
they
wore
but
they
went
about
their
daily
work
with
a
hushed
and
subdued
air
as
if
there
was
death
in
the
house
and
they
fully
felt
the
weight
of
the
mystery
and
ever
at
table
stood
the
vacant
chair
while
covers
were
laid
as
usual
for
the
absent
one
an
accident
must
have
happened
but
of
what
nature
lord
aberfeldie
was
beginning
to
think
grimly
vaguely
and
painfully
of
the
future
if
aught
fatal
had
happened
to
allan
his
only
son
an
idea
from
which
his
soul
shrunk
his
cherished
title
and
the
grand
old
house
of
dundargue
would
pass
to
a
remote
cousin
one
who
by
long
residence
in
england
by
there
by
training
breeding
and
habit
of
thought
cared
no
more
for
scotland
and
her
interests
or
for
the
traditions
of
the
grahams
of
aberfeldie
than
for
those
of
timbuctoo
such
ideas
and
fears
had
occurred
to
him
once
before
he
could
remember
when
allan
name
appeared
among
the
list
of
severely
wounded
in
that
episode
of
the
afghan
affair
which
won
him
the
victoria
cross
to
lady
aberfeldie
such
ideas
if
they
occurred
at
all
were
minor
indeed
to
the
memories
of
allan
as
the
babe
she
had
nursed
in
her
bosom
and
the
boy
who
had
prattled
at
her
knee
and
on
whom
in
manhood
and
his
prime
she
had
gazed
with
such
maternal
pride
and
admiration
when
she
saw
him
with
the
tartan
and
plumed
bonnet
in
all
the
bravery
of
the
black
watch
as
for
poor
olive
and
eveline
they
could
only
weep
together
from
time
to
time
in
all
the
girlish
abandonment
of
woe
so
hour
by
hour
the
silent
time
stole
on
at
dundargue
till
now
olive
had
never
known
how
deeply
and
truly
she
loved
allan
of
the
hold
his
image
had
upon
her
heart
and
how
she
had
repented
the
pain
her
petulance
must
have
cost
him
her
eyes
in
the
morning
light
looked
weary
and
yet
there
was
an
unnatural
sparkle
in
that
weariness
her
rich
brown
hair
to
the
dismay
of
mademoiselle
clairette
was
left
almost
undressed
and
was
pushed
back
from
her
throbbing
temples
her
lips
though
scarlet
still
looked
hard
dry
and
cracked
while
the
whole
expression
of
her
face
seemed
changed
what
was
to
be
the
clue
if
ever
there
would
be
one
to
this
dreadful
mystery
meanwhile
it
might
be
inquired
by
the
reader
whether
hawke
holcroft
was
troubled
by
his
conscience
he
certainly
never
betrayed
any
outward
signs
thereof
though
conscience
has
been
described
as
making
cowards
of
us
all
but
he
was
not
without
certain
reasonable
and
wholesome
fears
of
discovery
and
connection
of
the
crime
with
himself
he
was
far
away
from
dundargue
and
all
its
influences
in
fact
it
seemed
a
kind
of
dream
to
him
the
circumstance
of
ever
having
been
there
at
all
and
as
weeks
passed
on
nothing
could
exceed
his
perplexity
and
astonishment
though
located
in
an
obscure
corner
of
london
to
avoid
his
creditors
and
everyone
else
to
hear
nothing
of
the
affair
at
dundargue
or
of
the
master
being
missing
sedulously
he
searched
the
daily
prints
sedulously
he
watched
the
sensational
portions
of
the
evening
third
and
fourth
editions
but
the
matter
was
never
referred
to
no
advertisements
appeared
offering
rewards
no
detectives
or
the
usual
machinery
seemed
to
have
been
put
in
motion
what
could
it
all
mean
this
silence
and
mystery
everything
however
trivial
finds
its
way
into
print
now
and
the
son
of
a
peer
and
an
officer
in
her
majesty
service
too
does
not
vanish
every
day
at
last
he
got
a
shock
when
a
poster
proclaimed
in
large
capitals
mysterious
outrage
at
dun
but
his
sight
failed
him
for
a
moment
and
when
again
he
looked
he
perceived
that
it
was
not
dundargue
but
that
was
mentioned
with
reference
to
the
affair
of
a
past
time
but
in
all
this
we
are
somewhat
anticipating
chapter
the
oubliette
in
these
unromantic
plodding
prosaic
days
of
railways
telegraphs
and
telephones
who
would
imagine
that
the
fine
old
family
mansion
of
dundargue
would
be
the
scene
of
a
crime
of
a
tragedy
suited
only
to
the
days
of
the
sir
malise
graham
of
the
fourteenth
century
yet
so
it
was
allan
was
not
killed
he
was
perhaps
one
of
those
fellows
who
are
not
easily
killed
but
he
was
severely
injured
by
the
fall
and
concussion
and
it
was
long
before
he
began
to
struggle
back
into
a
consciousness
of
existence
as
he
had
fallen
partly
on
his
head
and
left
shoulder
the
former
had
suffered
from
that
circumstance
and
from
the
dreadful
blow
dealt
him
by
hawke
holcroft
and
he
was
not
slow
in
discovering
that
his
left
arm
was
useless
broken
above
the
elbow
heaven
it
is
not
my
sword
arm
he
whispered
huskily
as
he
strove
to
stagger
up
but
only
to
sink
helplessly
down
again
on
the
cold
stone
floor
of
his
prison
he
was
too
weak
too
confused
to
feel
either
just
rage
or
indignation
yet
there
was
a
horrible
sense
of
utter
unreality
in
the
whole
situation
in
which
he
so
suddenly
found
himself
and
some
time
elapsed
before
the
whole
episode
with
holcroft
his
unfortunate
offer
to
show
him
this
fatal
place
the
situation
and
character
of
which
had
suddenly
suggested
the
crime
their
idling
in
the
smoking
and
wandering
through
corridors
up
and
down
ancient
stairs
with
eventually
a
sudden
recollection
of
the
whole
adventure
surged
into
his
brain
and
a
gasp
of
rage
escaped
him
coward
and
villain
muttered
allan
looking
upward
but
all
was
darkness
there
and
around
him
the
hours
stole
on
he
staggered
up
and
at
last
began
to
explore
the
place
in
which
he
found
himself
a
somewhat
needless
act
as
he
knew
it
but
too
well
having
many
a
time
when
a
boy
with
fear
awe
and
curiosity
lowered
down
a
candle
at
the
end
of
a
string
and
seen
it
swaying
to
and
fro
far
down
below
till
the
damp
vapour
extinguished
the
flame
yet
he
felt
with
his
right
hand
the
circular
wall
of
massive
masonry
which
enclosed
him
carefully
again
and
again
in
the
desperate
hope
of
finding
some
outlet
though
he
knew
well
by
the
history
and
traditions
of
the
place
that
no
such
thing
could
ever
have
existed
but
he
could
not
remain
still
or
withstand
the
nervous
desire
for
exertion
to
be
up
and
doing
something
till
again
he
sank
on
the
floor
in
utter
weariness
of
heart
albeit
that
heart
was
aflame
with
rage
he
uttered
shouts
for
help
from
time
to
time
till
his
voice
became
hoarse
and
began
to
fail
him
and
his
spirit
too
as
he
knew
the
enormous
thickness
of
the
old
walls
around
him
and
tears
of
rage
almost
escaped
him
as
he
pondered
over
the
cold
and
calculating
villainy
of
which
he
was
now
so
mysteriously
the
helpless
victim
he
had
no
doubt
that
the
hours
of
the
night
were
now
stealing
on
and
that
long
ere
this
his
absence
must
have
been
discovered
and
speculation
would
be
rife
he
had
his
watch
but
he
was
in
utter
and
blackest
darkness
and
his
box
of
cigar
lights
having
dropped
from
his
pocket
he
had
no
means
of
consulting
the
dial
he
could
but
lie
there
in
great
pain
and
passive
misery
a
misery
that
seemed
so
unnatural
that
it
was
like
a
nightmare
an
unreality
that
must
pass
away
as
suddenly
as
it
had
come
upon
him
how
terrible
and
indescribable
however
grew
his
aching
thoughts
as
the
weary
time
went
on
he
might
die
of
cold
of
hunger
of
agony
die
within
a
few
yards
of
his
own
hearthstone
die
thus
under
his
father
roof
and
close
by
where
at
that
very
moment
the
whole
family
were
a
prey
to
bewilderment
and
distress
by
his
sudden
disappearance
oh
it
was
all
too
maddening
to
think
of
so
there
he
could
but
lie
buried
immured
entombed
in
darkness
chill
as
death
not
a
breath
of
pure
air
in
his
nostrils
not
the
faintest
glimmer
of
light
and
no
human
sound
in
his
ears
as
the
hours
crept
on
he
could
scarcely
distinguish
waking
from
sleeping
a
dream
from
reality
and
at
times
all
seemed
to
become
chaos
and
he
could
think
of
nothing
unless
it
were
a
buzzing
in
his
head
and
the
acute
agony
of
his
broken
arm
anon
he
would
utter
a
feeble
shout
for
but
his
own
voice
seemed
to
return
to
him
beyond
the
walls
that
enclosed
him
it
would
not
go
he
knew
that
there
are
situations
in
life
incident
to
misery
and
painful
excitement
when
the
human
machinery
by
the
rapidity
of
mental
action
is
worn
out
sooner
than
its
alloted
time
and
he
began
to
consider
how
long
it
was
possible
to
exist
without
food
or
water
wearily
agonisingly
the
hours
dragged
on
by
this
time
he
was
certain
that
night
had
passed
and
day
had
come
again
and
what
must
the
thoughts
of
his
people
be
inquiries
and
searches
would
be
made
he
knew
but
who
would
ever
dream
of
searching
for
him
where
he
was
he
had
not
yet
begun
to
suffer
from
hunger
but
he
had
a
considerable
thirst
and
hunger
would
come
too
he
thought
of
all
he
had
read
of
the
endurance
of
men
on
rafts
and
in
open
boats
at
sea
of
entombed
miners
buried
deep
in
the
bowels
of
the
earth
and
his
hair
seemed
to
bristle
up
at
the
recollections
hunger
thirst
and
an
unknown
death
or
death
at
such
craven
hands
god
he
moaned
aid
never
never
come
in
that
gruesome
place
and
time
there
occurred
to
him
ghastly
memory
thoughts
of
the
unknown
and
forgotten
dead
whose
matted
bones
had
been
found
in
it
by
antiquarian
explorers
as
he
had
mentioned
to
holcroft
the
remains
of
unfortunate
creatures
flung
in
there
by
his
forefathers
could
it
be
that
this
fate
of
his
was
to
be
a
species
of
expiation
for
them
and
was
he
to
die
now
by
this
death
when
life
had
become
to
him
so
much
dearer
than
ever
if
his
disappearance
remained
utterly
unaccounted
for
and
his
death
became
as
of
course
it
would
be
a
thing
of
the
past
and
forgotten
even
by
those
to
whom
he
was
dear
might
not
hawke
holcroft
regain
such
influence
as
he
had
ever
possessed
over
olive
and
make
her
his
own
she
would
be
free
then
there
would
be
no
obstacle
and
no
other
rendering
of
the
will
necessary
now
that
was
removed
never
again
to
see
her
face
or
the
faces
of
those
he
loved
and
who
loved
him
so
to
die
a
rat
death
within
arm
length
of
them
almost
could
his
ancestor
have
foreseen
when
he
formed
this
infernal
trap
that
one
of
his
own
race
was
to
perish
therein
and
thus
after
a
time
amid
all
this
tangle
of
terrible
thoughts
he
began
to
forget
where
he
was
his
senses
partly
left
him
he
believed
himself
to
be
with
the
regiment
the
black
watch
with
their
dark
tartans
and
historic
crimson
plumes
he
heard
the
crash
of
the
drums
the
braying
of
the
pipes
and
saw
many
familiar
faces
around
him
those
of
cameron
and
carslogie
among
others
now
the
regiment
was
going
into
action
he
saw
the
line
forming
the
eyes
of
the
men
lighting
grimly
up
as
they
loaded
and
the
sunshine
flashed
upon
the
ridges
of
levelled
steel
the
dream
seemed
a
palpable
one
and
with
a
shout
louder
than
he
thought
he
could
utter
he
called
upon
them
to
follow
him
in
the
charge
his
own
cry
awoke
or
roused
him
the
glorious
vision
of
the
charging
line
melted
into
opaque
darkness
and
now
allan
found
himself
weaker
than
ever
he
thought
all
was
nearly
over
with
him
now
he
turned
his
thoughts
to
prayer
ere
it
might
be
too
late
and
from
pondering
on
release
and
vengeance
and
the
things
of
this
life
he
began
to
think
as
his
powers
ebbed
of
the
life
to
come
he
felt
that
he
must
resign
himself
to
the
inevitable
and
to
die
to
die
there
after
all
and
at
last
he
became
totally
insensible
chapter

the
shout
uttered
by
allan
in
his
delirium
had
not
been
uttered
in
vain
it
chanced
that
tappleton
the
old
butler
who
had
been
custodier
of
the
wine
binns
and
the
massive
old
plate
in
its
chest
since
the
present
lord
aberfeldie
was
a
baby
in
long
clothes
had
entered
his
dusty
and
cobwebbed
repositories
and
was
seeking
through
their
stone
shelves
for
some
fine
old
crusted
port
of
a
peculiar
vintage
kept
alone
for
the
use
of
his
master
and
himself
when
the
cry
of
allan
and
some
other
strange
sounds
reached
his
ears
as
he
thought
and
seriously
startled
him
we
say
he
thought
for
the
recess
of
his
wine
binns
was
an
unlikely
place
to
hear
any
other
sound
than
that
made
by
a
scared
rat
it
was
now
the
dead
dull
silence
of
midnight
when
the
sounds
that
are
unknown
amid
the
buzz
of
life
are
heard
and
seem
so
oddly
so
preternaturally
loud
and
strange
a
crack
in
a
door
panel
or
wainscot
the
tap
of
a
moth
against
the
distant
noises
that
come
we
know
not
how
or
from
what
on
the
still
damp
air
in
a
country
house
at
night
there
is
usually
a
solemn
stillness
that
is
painful
and
oppressive
to
the
wakeful
and
it
was
amidst
this
silence
the
cry
for
a
human
cry
it
was
reached
the
startled
ear
but
whence
had
it
come
out
of
the
stone
wall
or
from
the
ground
beneath
or
from
the
throat
of
a
raven
in
one
of
the
great
chimneys
of
the
old
house
thought
tappleton
was
the
voice
of
a
man
or
a
ghost
at
the
latter
idea
he
closed
the
door
and
retired
with
precipitation
to
his
cosy
room
and
thought
the
matter
over
as
he
stirred
and
sipped
his
hot
whisky
toddy
but
feeling
ever
and
anon
that
wild
throbbing
of
the
heart
and
electric
chill
and
rising
of
the
hair
which
accompanies
supernatural
panic
the
old
man
had
a
most
uncomfortable
feeling
about
the
voice
he
had
heard
and
its
strangely
muffled
sound
seemed
to
come
in
fancy
to
his
ear
again
and
again
and
now
he
not
unnaturally
began
to
associate
it
with
the
mysterious
disappearance
of
allan
the
master
with
earliest
dawn
he
betook
himself
to
his
wine
cellar
again
and
felt
that
he
was
a
bolder
man
in
daylight
than
in
the
gloom
of
midnight
but
men
are
says
charles
dickens
yet
when
an
unmistakable
moan
or
two
reached
his
ears
his
fear
of
the
supernatural
so
nearly
gained
the
ascendancy
that
he
was
about
to
take
to
flight
again
however
he
paused
while
his
old
heart
beat
painfully
and
began
to
think
of
what
adjoined
his
cellars
and
at
once
there
flashed
upon
his
memory
the
locality
of
the
horrible
old
vault
for
the
butler
knew
all
the
and
ins
of
dundargue
as
well
as
if
he
had
built
it
in
the
course
of
modern
alterations
and
repairs
a
portion
of
the
originally
enormous
wall
of
the
vault
had
been
thinned
and
cut
away
there
were
crannies
in
the
masonry
and
it
was
through
these
the
voice
of
the
imprisoned
had
reached
the
butler
during
his
casual
visit
to
his
cellar
one
is
there
good
heavens
if
it
should
be
the
master
the
master
after
a
exclaimed
tappleton
and
quick
as
his
old
legs
could
carry
him
he
rushed
up
stairs
through
the
along
the
arched
corridor
and
reached
at
last
the
oak
but
when
he
saw
it
with
its
great
iron
hasp
over
the
rusted
staple
hope
died
away
and
his
soul
sank
within
him
loth
to
linger
in
a
place
where
as
we
have
stated
superstition
believed
that
those
who
did
so
had
a
creeping
sense
of
having
near
them
shadowy
forms
and
intangible
presences
he
was
on
the
point
of
turning
away
when
controlling
his
silly
fears
he
thought
he
might
as
well
pursue
his
investigations
further
he
raised
the
and
almost
immediately
a
voice
ascended
to
his
ear
from
the
darkness
below
he
peered
down
but
could
see
nothing
is
there
wha
spoke
asked
the
butler
i
the
master
replied
the
weak
voice
of
allan
graham
sir
heaven
be
gude
tae
us
you
sir
hoo
in
god
name
cam
ye
to
be
doon
there
cried
tappleton
in
mingled
joy
horror
and
great
perplexity
help
there
a
good
old
fellow
get
me
out
and
then
you
will
know
all
quick
tappleton
or
or
i
shall
not
last
much
longer
replied
allan
faintly
and
at
intervals
in
a
voice
so
low
that
his
last
words
seemed
to
die
away
while
tappleton
rushed
off
as
fast
as
his
years
would
permit
to
seek
lord
aberfeldie
and
alarm
the
whole
household
which
he
did
very
effectually
by
a
sudden
and
furious
application
to
the
great
causing
a
very
general
idea
of
fire
and
bringing
all
from
their
rooms
in
various
kinds
of
at
that
early
hour
of
the
morning
master
found
the
master
found
he
kept
shouting
on
every
hand
where
asked
twenty
voices
ye
may
weel
ask
was
the
tantalizing
response
in
the
breast
of
lord
aberfeldie
and
all
his
household
incredulity
at
first
and
then
profound
astonishment
reigned
for
a
time
on
the
butler
making
himself
understood
and
all
hastened
to
the
scene
of
his
discovery
master
the
master
down
there
muttered
the
servants
looking
inquiringly
in
each
other
faces
came
such
a
thing
to
pass
they
jostled
and
impeded
each
other
but
lord
aberfeldie
authority
and
promptitude
soon
defined
a
line
of
action
lights
and
ropes
look
alive
men
he
exclaimed
these
requisites
were
soon
brought
away
take
courage
we
soon
have
you
out
exclaimed
his
father
the
ropes
tightly
round
you
allan
in
a
faint
voice
made
them
aware
that
this
was
impossible
as
his
left
arm
was
broken
tidings
which
added
commiseration
and
grief
to
the
blank
amazement
of
olive
eveline
and
his
mother
will
go
down
asked
lord
aberfeldie
looking
around
him
and
i
and
i
every
man
in
the
house
was
ready
to
descend
but
angus
glas
the
active
young
deerstalker
slid
down
the
rope
with
a
lanthorn
in
his
hand
followed
by
the
prayer
of
olive
who
would
not
be
kept
back
her
eyes
wild
her
now
pale
lips
apart
her
sweet
face
blanched
and
a
strange
stiffness
in
all
her
usually
lithe
limbs
pale
as
death
his
face
plastered
with
dried
blood
blood
that
had
flowed
from
a
contusion
in
his
head
livid
and
helpless
his
left
arm
hanging
limp
as
an
empty
sleeve
by
his
side
his
eyes
half
closed
as
if
unable
to
endure
the
glare
of
the
day
after
being
so
long
in
the
dark
allan
was
brought
up
and
on
beholding
him
the
exclamations
of
commiseration
and
astonishment
redoubled
and
yet
it
could
be
seen
that
he
was
almost
past
questioning
and
mounted
grooms
were
instantly
despatched
to
summon
all
the
medical
aid
of
the
district
had
the
butler
nocturnal
visit
to
his
binns
been
hours
later
allan
graham
must
have
perished
and
his
fate
might
never
have
been
known
in
his
own
generation
perhaps
the
whole
catastrophe
seemed
so
strange
unintelligible
unnatural
and
harrowing
that
the
nerves
of
lady
aberfeldie
were
terribly
shaken
by
it
so
were
those
of
her
daughter
and
olive
and
each
needed
all
the
comfort
and
support
the
other
could
give
some
wine
which
he
drank
thirstily
first
revived
the
patient
after
he
was
conveyed
to
his
room
in
the
name
of
heaven
allan
came
you
to
fall
into
that
place
asked
his
father
did
not
fall
in
replied
allan
in
a
species
of
husky
whisper
then
was
all
allan
could
utter
when
the
room
seemed
to
swim
round
him
and
he
became
insensible
lord
aberfeldie
knew
not
precisely
what
to
make
of
the
reply
but
suspicion
gave
him
a
certain
clue
to
what
he
thought
had
happened
and
the
same
idea
seemed
to
occur
to
young
angus
the
gillie
who
was
assisting
to
undress
his
master
and
put
him
to
bed
for
his
eyes
gleamed
under
their
shaggy
brows
and
he
could
only
mutter
from
time
to
time
mille
maloch
a
malediction
in
which
lord
aberfeldie
heartily
concurred
when
ultimately
the
peer
learned
all
that
had
transpired
the
incident
of
the
cheque
he
had
so
innocently
and
generously
given
holcroft
was
completely
forgotten
he
felt
only
rage
mingled
with
utter
stupefaction
that
a
man
could
act
so
basely
as
his
recent
guest
had
done
it
was
altogether
out
of
his
calculation
and
experience
of
human
life
in
every
way
what
is
to
be
done
now
to
search
out
and
punish
this
malignant
scoundrel
he
exclaimed
while
lady
aberfeldie
all
her
motherly
feelings
outraged
was
for
raising
fire
and
sword
and
letting
loose
all
the
terrors
of
the
law
on
holcroft
head
lord
aberfeldie
however
after
a
time
thought
differently
he
had
a
horror
of
publicity
of
newspaper
gossip
and
scandals
of
making
his
honoured
and
ancestral
home
and
the
affairs
of
his
family
a
as
he
said
for
such
things
a
world
wonder
even
for
a
time
and
thus
he
declined
to
attempt
to
punish
holcroft
for
an
outrage
none
had
seen
him
commit
he
would
leave
that
to
the
course
of
events
and
to
time
the
avenger
more
than
all
the
name
of
olive
raymond
might
crop
up
in
the
unseemly
matter
father
was
a
brave
good
fellow
and
my
dearest
friend
said
lord
aberfeldie
sadly
comes
his
son
to
be
such
an
utter
villain
he
has
drawn
his
evil
tendencies
from
some
past
generation
it
is
said
that
such
a
kind
of
poison
is
at
times
transmitted
in
the
blood
and
that
no
human
being
can
truly
value
the
resistance
of
sin
or
folly
but
lady
aberfeldie
was
stormy
and
declined
to
be
pacified
have
the
future
to
think
of
said
her
husband
again
tongues
to
guard
against
for
the
sake
of
olive
our
whole
family
and
my
old
comrade
the
general
who
is
now
in
his
grave
the
father
of
that
foul
ingrate
thus
it
was
that
no
mention
of
the
affair
was
made
by
the
daily
prints
to
the
surprise
certainly
and
perhaps
the
relief
of
holcroft
mind
no
more
on
this
subject
eveline
said
lord
aberfeldie
as
he
sought
to
soothe
his
wife
would
i
forget
that
we
had
ever
sheltered
at
dundargue
a
guest
so
degrading
in
character
gladly
would
i
forget
as
soon
as
possible
if
it
be
possible
the
hours
of
intense
suffering
we
have
undergone
more
than
all
that
allan
must
have
undergone
in
that
horrible
place
and
yet
under
his
own
roof
many
a
silent
and
reproachful
tear
olive
shed
in
secret
as
she
knew
in
the
recent
past
time
how
much
her
pride
petulance
and
suspicion
had
done
to
further
jealousy
and
resentment
in
the
mind
of
holcroft
against
her
cousin
and
she
felt
that
too
probably
she
had
caused
all
this
but
holcroft
was
a
bankrupt
and
a
blackleg
now
and
never
more
at
london
or
anywhere
else
she
thought
could
he
cross
path
again
till
now
she
never
believed
that
the
world
could
contain
a
man
so
utterly
unprincipled
so
thoroughly
base
the
household
servants
supposed
that
the
master
had
fallen
into
that
gruesome
vault
by
accident
and
they
were
allowed
to
adopt
the
idea
who
closed
the
trap
and
dropped
the
hasp
over
the
staple
thought
old
tappleton
yet
eventually
he
allowed
himself
to
be
talked
into
the
idea
that
he
had
made
a
mistake
in
that
matter
allan
lay
long
ill
and
delirious
after
all
he
had
undergone
but
when
it
was
announced
that
he
was
past
danger
great
was
the
rejoicing
of
all
the
servants
and
the
household
at
dundargue
for
all
loved
the
master
well
and
were
faithfully
attached
to
the
family

ties
of

and
clanship

loyalty

undiminished
for
generations
after
the
system
of

government
was
abolished
in
said
the
newspaper
recently
it
would
be
wholly
erroneous
to
contend
that
the
peculiar
affection
between
the
people
and
their
chief
altogether
different
in
nature
and
degree
from
any
relationship
known
in

the

located
at

a

modern

to

of

they
had
removed

of

more
than

that

had
met
with

fall
from

in

heard
of
allan

illness
in
a
vague
way
as
lord
aberfeldie
shrunk
from
all
gossip
publicity
and
surmise
and
the
learned
that
eveline
marriage
had
been
delayed
in
consequence
of
that
illness
chiefly
through
a
letter
written
to
him
by
olive
at
allan
request

the
early
days
of
spring
were
passing
on
and
no

change
had
taken
place
in
the
relative
positions
of
our

we

them

alone
one
afternoon
in

of

was
divided
into

of

season
everywhere
but
nowhere
is
it
lovelier
than
in
the
fertile
lothians
and
nowhere
may
the
eye
rest
upon
a
more
varied
and
beautiful
landscape
than
that
which
spreads
from
the
southern
slope
of
corstorphine
wooded
crags
to
the
base
of
the
green
and
undulating
pentlands
the
highest
summits
of
which
range
from
sixteen
hundred
to
nearly
nineteen
hundred
feet
there
are
teeming
with
fertility
rows
of
stately
trees
pretty
cottages
stately
white
manor
houses
and
cosy
farms
embosomed
among
old
woods
and
orchards
the
picturesque
rocks
of
wooded
craiglockhart
wherein
the
kites
and
kestrels
build
their
nests
the
rich
alluvial
land
where
for
ages
a
great
loch
once
spread
its
waters
the
quaint
old
village
church
on
the
spire
of
which
the
red
sunset
loves
to
linger
and
westward
the
queen
of
the
north
in
all
the
glory
of
castled
rock
and
hill
and
crag
spire
tower
and
countless
terraces
and
on
all
of
these
the
wistful
eyes
of
eveline
grahame
were
wandering
dreamily
a
golden
glory
was
cast
along
the
eastern
slopes
the
fleecy
clouds
were
every
moment
assuming
new
forms
and
lovelier
colours
the
woods
were
budding
forth
the
leith
and
its
tiny
tributaries
were
brawling
along
as
if
their
waters
had
no
time
to
toy
with
the
brown
pebbles
seated
at
times
sideways
on
their
horses
the
happy
ploughboys
were
already
going
home
from
their
labours
the
lambs
were
frisking
about
the
ewes
and
cloud
and
sunshine
seemed
to
chase
each
other
over
the
tender
grass
where
the
wild
white
gowan
was
opening
its
petals
and
old
folks
were
remembering
that
peck
o
march
dust
was
worth
the
ransom
o
a
king
of
late
eveline
bursts
of
girlish
merriment
had
been
few
and
far
between
she
was
fretful
unusually
so
for
a
girl
who
by
nature
was
so
sweet
and
gentle
and
at
the
mere
mention
of
the
name
of
sir
paget
to
whom
she
felt
herself
doomed
as
it
were
or
allotted
she
became
more
fretful
silent
and
abstracted
she
shrank
from
smiling
people
turned
her
back
upon
inquisitive
ones
and
often
was
found
to
answer
briefly
and
beside
the
point
in
short
the
pretty
eveline
heart
or
mind
was
quite
unhinged
the
tenth
day
of
her
residence
at
maviswood
was
creeping
slowly
on
and
she
was
pondering
full
of
thought
alone
in
that
stately
room
when
a
servant
startled
her
by
announcing
and
ushering
in
evan
cameron
and
though
her
mind
was
full
of
him
of
the
evening
of
the
at
dundargue
and
the
hour
of
joy
in
the
corridor
a
kind
of
gasp
escaped
her
as
she
rose
from
her
seat
to
receive
him
but
why
should
he
not
call
reason
suggested
to
her
the
grahams
had
been
for
ten
days
we
have
said
at
maviswood
and
cameron
who
had
been
counting
every
hour
of
those
ten
days
and
watching
the
villa
with
his
from
his
quarters
in
the
distant
castle
had
now
ventured
to
make
an
afternoon
walk
and
found
beyond
his
hopes
that
eveline
was
alone
allan
and
olive
were
out
together
in
a
lord
and
lady
aberfeldie
were
he
cared
not
where
anyway
they
were
absent
too
olive
feeling
that
she
was
in
some
way
responsible
by
her
past
thoughtlessness
petulance
and
flirting
with
the
daring
and
unworthy
holcroft
for
much
that
had
befallen
allan
now
on
him
hand
and
foot
as
the
old
nurse
nannie
phrased
it
she
was
with
him
from
hour
to
hour
and
though
their
marriage
was
delayed
how
happy
they
seemed
to
be
fearing
interruption
as
before
cameron
too
tender
and
true
not
to
be
a
timid
lover
found
a
difficulty
just
then
in
taking
up
the
thread
of
the
old
story
and
they
stood
in
the
talking
commonplaces
while
heart
was
speaking
to
heart
and
eye
to
eye
but
is
speaking
or
hearing
when
heart
wells
into
heart
cameron
heard
all
she
chose
then
to
tell
him
about
the
bewilderment
and
alarm
of
the
family
and
so
forth
many
friends
were
spoken
of
but
sir
paget
was
of
course
referred
to
by
neither
eveline
though
so
young
had
the
frank
and
perfect
air
of
repose
in
her
manner
that
came
of
gentle
breeding
and
made
her
seem
older
than
she
was
but
gave
an
assurance
that
whatever
she
said
or
whatever
she
did
was
said
and
done
in
the
right
way
without
coquetry
her
manner
was
full
of
simple
fascination
but
it
was
undeniably
nervous
now
for
she
read
by
cameron
softened
voice
and
in
his
brightening
eye
the
clear
necessity
for
something
else
than
talk
when
he
discovered
by
a
casual
remark
that
lord
and
lady
aberfeldie
were
not
in
the
house
eveline
felt
that
she
had
given
herself
to
evan
and
that
the
tenor
of
their
interview
in
the
corridor
amounted
tacitly
to
an
engagement
an
engagement
but
to
what
end
it
all
seemed
but
a
dream
a
delicious
dream
of
which
there
was
nothing
to
remind
her
not
even
a
ring
a
lock
of
hair
or
the
tiniest
note
unlike
cameron
eveline
while
loving
him
dearly
had
singular
to
say
no
thought
of
marriage
with
him
in
the
ordinary
sense
of
the
word
for
hemmed
round
as
she
was
and
destined
as
she
was
the
idea
was
a
hopeless
one
judged
from
her
parents
point
of
view
she
only
felt
poor
girl
that
she
loved
and
was
full
of
sad
joy
if
we
may
use
the
paradox
in
the
belief
that
she
was
truly
loved
in
return
silent
you
have
become
she
said
in
a
low
tone
after
a
nervous
pause
know
not
what
to
say
but
love
has
no
need
of
words
eveline
nor
needs
he
many
at
any
time
he
replied
drawing
closer
to
her
then
he
took
a
conservatory
rose
from
a
vase
and
exclaimed
darling
you
love
me
well
and
truly
do
you
and
truly
you
know
dear
evan
she
replied
as
his
arm
went
round
her
and
her
head
dropped
on
his
shoulder
need
to
ask
me
she
whispered
in
a
breathless
voice
i
can
not
hear
the
beloved
assurance
too
often
he
kissed
her
tenderly
we
can
not
say
how
many
times
nor
would
it
matter
while
she
lay
passive
in
his
arms
and
then
he
said
we
try
our
fate
with
this
rose
plucking
it
leaf
by
leaf
saying
each
time
lucky
unlucky
till
the
last
leaf
comes
la
decidedly
no
dearest
evan
are
superstitious
well
so
am
i
an
omen
would
only
torment
us
and
surely
we
have
enough
enough
tears
choked
her
voice
and
she
could
only
add
dearest
evan
trust
what
my
darling
great
goodness
of
god
the
spell
of
a
great
love
was
on
both
their
lips
met
in
a
long
and
silent
kiss
and
the
rose
fell
at
their
feet
between
them
a
sound
roused
them
nay
startled
them
they
had
only
time
to
separate
and
affect
a
sudden
interest
in
the
artistic
effects
produced
by
light
and
shadow
on
the
landscape
when
lord
and
lady
aberfeldie
entered
the
room
together
a
pretty
palpable
cloud
of
annoyance
resting
on
the
brows
of
both
as
they
politely
but
far
from
warmly
greeted
the
visitor
the
peer
who
had
evidently
been
out
riding
appeared
in
a
black
morning
coat
and
white
cords
whip
in
hand
and
the
lady
who
had
been
in
the
grounds
wore
her
garden
hat
and
shawl
she
had
seen
a
visitor
ride
up
to
the
door
from
a
distant
part
of
the
lawn
and
had
hurried
home
her
heart
foreboding
truly
who
that
visitor
was
and
now
while
their
hearts
were
vibrating
with
tenderness
and
with
their
lips
yet
tremulously
sensible
of
the
sweetness
of
kisses
the
first
kisses
of
a
new
and
early
love
they
had
to
talk
enforced
commonplace
or
at
least
evan
did
so
while
eveline
remained
silent
of
the
news
of
the
day
the
expected
plans
of
the
ministry
the
probable
despatch
of
a
fleet
to
egyptian
waters
of
the
chances
of
an
army
following
it
of
arabi
pasha
and
the
khedive
the
plot
formed
by
the
circassian
officers
and
so
forth
till
it
was
time
for
the
lingering
cameron
to
resume
his
hat
and
depart
at
last
cameron
tried
to
ignore
that
which
under
other
and
more
prosperous
circumstances
would
have
galled
and
roused
his
haughty
highland
spirit
lord
aberfeldie
coldness
of
manner
when
he
spoke
even
of
the
regiment
and
how
certainly
it
would
go
to
the
east
the
black
watch
thank
god
was
always
in
everything
and
always
with
honour
while
evan
eyes
irresistibly
wandered
to
the
face
of
eveline
and
memory
went
back
to
the
twilighted
corridor
at
dundargue
but
so
did
the
memory
of
my
lord
aberfeldie
the
peer
must
have
undergone
a
good
deal
of
training
or
drilling
lately
at
the
hands
of
lady
aberfeldie
before
he
could
have
brought
himself
to
behave
so
coldly
to
one
he
really
liked
so
well
as
young
stratherroch
and
one
of
the
black
watch
especially
but
then
perhaps
he
was
just
a
little
soured
by
the
sequel
to
the
hospitality
and
kindness
accorded
to
the
son
of
his
old
friend
which
son
had
contrived
by
skilful
lettering
and
figuring
to
add
the
sum
of
eighty
pounds
to
his
cheque
as
he
bade
them
adieu
stratherroch
observed
that
lord
aberfeldie
did
not
ask
him
to
call
again
at
maviswood
and
keenly
did
he
feel
the
omission
and
all
it
implied
and
with
it
came
the
conviction
that
he
must
call
no
more
slowly
he
rode
back
to
his
quarters
full
of
alternately
exultant
and
bitter
thoughts
exultant
that
eveline
loved
him
and
would
never
cease
to
love
him
but
bitter
ones
as
he
asked
himself
to
what
end
if
poor
cameron
had
vague
and
lingering
hopes
to
which
he
clung
and
doubtless
he
had
hopes
when
seeing
eveline
of
proposing
or
hinting
of
meeting
elsewhere
in
the
future
they
were
doomed
to
blight
for
no
such
bore
fruition
and
they
had
now
parted
and
her
father
and
mother
thought
they
should
part
as
mere
friends
who
might
meet
casually
in
society
but
at
all
events
had
better
meet
again
and
cameron
feared
that
so
far
as
monetary
matters
stood
with
him
his
friend
allan
might
endorse
the
same
view
of
the
situation
is
a
gentleman
by
birth
and
position
but
poor
miserably
poor
said
lady
aberfeldie
after
he
had
gone
was
that
precious
holcroft
and
when
a
declension
takes
place
in
tone
manner
and
habits
as
in
his
instance
we
never
know
where
it
may
end
she
added
pointedly
to
eveline
can
you
speak
of
the
two
men
in
the
same
sentence
exclaimed
the
peer
with
an
asperity
for
which
his
daughter
thanked
him
in
her
aching
heart
at
anytime
when
eveline
looked
from
maviswood
she
could
see
the
castle
of
edinburgh
and
the
towering
mass
of
the
western
barrack
with
all
its
windows
shining
in
the
sun
and
she
always
did
so
with
tenderest
interest
as
she
knew
that
was
there
but
natheless
her
experience
of
at
least
one
london
season
there
was
much
of
the
guileless
child
and
mere
girl
in
eveline
still
and
she
was
so
sweet
and
soft
so
pliable
and
so
impressed
with
her
mother
will
and
her
father
authority
that
that
how
could
evan
cameron
tell
what
pressure
might
be
brought
to
bear
upon
her
to
make
her
seem
to
transfer
the
allegiance
of
her
heart
to
another
even
to
the
wealthy
old
english
baronet
sir
paget
puddicombe
alas
there
was
to
be
in
time
a
pressure
that
none
could
then
foresee
chapter
viii
at
maviswood
the
reports
which
hawke
holcroft
spinning
out
his
precarious
existence
by
skill
with
the
billiard
cue
cards
and
the
betting
ring
heard
concerning
the
health
of
his
intended
victim
one
whom
he
still
absurdly
and
grotesquely
deemed
his
successful
rival
were
undoubtedly
true
with
all
his
natural
strength
allan
graham
recovered
but
slowly
from
all
he
had
undergone
and
the
many
hours
he
had
lingered
in
that
vault
with
his
fractured
limb
unset
together
with
the
effect
of
certain
sabre
wounds
received
when
he
served
in
india
retarded
his
progress
to
restoration
but
amid
his
protracted
convalescence
how
sweet
it
was
as
the
pleasant
days
of
sunny
spring
stole
on
at
maviswood
to
have
the
society
the
hourly
care
and
attendance
of
olive
in
whom
he
was
always
he
thought
discovering
some
new
charm
of
mind
or
grace
of
manner
with
much
soft
tenderness
of
heart
and
hand
thus
twice
once
in
india
and
again
at
home
rescued
as
it
were
from
the
verge
of
death
he
had
learned
the
sweetness
of
life
and
that
whatever
its
sufferings
and
sorrows
may
be
what
a
priceless
gift
it
is
a
reflection
that
never
occurred
to
him
when
going
under
fire
or
leading
a
line
of
highlanders
in
their
headlong
charge
lady
aberfeldie
was
content
and
happy
evan
cameron
seemed
now
a
banished
man
even
allan
never
spoke
of
him
and
the
progress
of
matters
between
the
cousins
proved
all
she
could
desire
could
be
more
fortunate
dearest
olive
than
the
attachment
which
now
subsists
between
you
and
allan
it
fulfils
all
your
father
fondest
wishes
said
she
as
she
met
them
one
day
in
the
garden
slowly
promenading
between
the
flowerbeds
allan
leaning
or
affecting
to
do
so
on
the
soft
round
arm
of
olive
mother
dear
i
agree
with
you
and
also
with
peter
simple
replied
allan
smiling
what
the
life
of
a
man
seems
to
consist
of
getting
into
scrapes
and
then
getting
out
of
them
again
you
forget
now
that
i
ever
teased
and
tormented
you
so
my
poor
allan
said
olive
patting
his
rather
pale
cheek
with
her
pinky
palm
course
i
do
darling
i
am
not
much
of
a
philosopher
but
balzac
is
right
in
his
view
of
human
life
that
it
would
be
intolerable
without
a
vast
amount
of
forgetting
forgiving
too
he
might
have
added
said
olive
as
she
tendered
her
lips
playfully
and
poutingly
for
a
kiss
which
he
was
not
slow
in
according
poor
eveline
as
she
watched
this
happy
pair
daily
under
her
eyes
sighed
with
natural
and
irrepressible
envy
she
thought
of
her
own
love
for
evan
cameron
secret
ignored
and
so
liable
to
excite
maternal
scorn
and
bitterness
with
paternal
reprehension
when
it
came
on
the
while
even
allan
at
all
times
so
loving
and
so
brotherly
amid
the
great
selfishness
or
absorption
of
his
own
passion
seemed
as
she
thought
to
have
withdrawn
his
sympathy
from
her
now
one
circumstance
she
deemed
most
fortunate
parliament
was
sitting
and
sir
paget
puddicombe
was
in
london
it
would
seem
then
that
between
the
botheration
of
ireland
and
the
interests
of
egypt
the
affairs
of
monetary
municipal
and
commercial
were
as
likely
to
be
forgotten
and
ignored
as
if
that
quiet
borough
had
actually
been
an
integral
part
of
scotland
a
state
of
matters
not
to
be
tolerated
so
sir
paget
was
in
his
place
at
westminster
jerking
his
head
and
puffing
out
his
chest
more
than
ever
and
eveline
was
freed
for
a
time
from
his
presence
and
the
regard
of
his
suspicious
and
old
eyes
and
she
knew
not
that
almost
daily
the
moment
that
he
was
free
from
duty
or
parade
was
over
evan
drawn
by
an
irrepressible
craving
and
desire
to
be
near
her
to
see
the
roof
under
which
she
dwelt
the
windows
through
which
she
might
be
looking
the
trees
under
which
she
might
be
walking
was
always
hovering
in
the
vicinity
of
maviswood
while
by
a
strange
fatality
she
filled
by
a
similar
desire
might
be
riding
with
her
father
or
driving
with
her
mother
through
stately
george
street
along
the
magnificent
terrace
of
princes
street
and
other
great
thoroughfares
looking
eagerly
but
in
vain
for
a
chance
glimpse
of
him
and
perhaps
a
bow
a
mere
bow
and
nothing
more
circumstanced
as
they
were
what
more
could
she
look
for
twice
only
and
at
long
intervals
did
she
see
evan
and
on
each
occasion
how
wildly
did
her
loving
heart
beat
as
she
detected
his
figure
but
he
saw
not
her
as
she
rode
slowly
on
by
her
father
side
who
if
he
saw
evan
on
the
first
occasion
steadily
ignored
the
fact
and
stared
up
at
the
castle
ramparts
where
the
sentinels
of
the
black
watch
trod
slowly
to
and
fro
certainly
evan
did
not
see
her
he
was
on
the
garden
side
of
princes
street
the
wooded
walk
which
somewhat
resembles
a
continental
boulevard
in
close
conversation
with
a
young
lady
who
seemed
to
listen
to
all
he
was
saying
with
great
the
second
time
she
saw
him
was
after
an
interval
of
some
days
in
the
same
place
at
the
same
hour
and
with
the
same
fair
companion
to
whom
her
father
thinking
no
doubt
to
utilise
the
circumstance
drew
her
attention
somewhat
pointedly
said
he
friend
seems
to
find
other
attractions
in
the
gardens
than
trees
or
spring
flowers
eveline
heart
beat
painfully
and
the
second
episode
gave
her
occasion
for
much
and
rather
harassing
thought
her
father
by
this
remark
showed
that
he
had
observed
evan
before
but
who
was
the
latter
companion
eveline
blushed
violently
up
to
where
the
brim
of
her
smart
pressed
her
bright
brown
hair
upon
her
brow
and
down
to
where
a
stiff
and
linen
collar
encircled
her
slender
white
neck
then
she
grew
very
pale
with
constrained
emotion
which
fortunately
her
father
did
not
detect
she
did
not
speak
but
pretended
to
smile
with
an
effort
of
while
a
lump
seemed
to
rise
in
her
slender
throat
for
though
the
circumstance
of
evan
who
was
debarred
from
coming
to
see
her
being
seen
there
again
with
the
same
young
lady
might
be
a
casualty
a
trivial
coincidence
and
quite
explainable
her
pride
was
piqued
and
her
affection
wounded
still
more
were
they
piqued
and
wounded
when
some
days
after
as
she
was
seated
in
the
carriage
at
the
door
of
a
shop
in
which
lady
aberfeldie
was
giving
some
orders
she
saw
this
girl
loitering
in
the
same
spot
looking
anxiously
around
her
as
if
waiting
for
some
one
who
did
not
come
and
whom
eveline
heart
foreboded
could
only
be
evan
cameron
she
snatched
from
the
or
reticule
a
lorgnette
through
which
she
could
see
that
the
girl
was
more
than
pretty
very
pale
and
though
plainly
yet
fashionably
dressed
with
an
undoubtedly
ladylike
air
and
bearing
if
he
was
evan
she
waited
for
he
did
not
keep
his
appointment
for
after
a
time
the
stranger
turned
sadly
lingeringly
away
and
disappeared
a
a
popular
young
fellow
like
evan
cameron
in
one
of
the
most
popular
of
scottish
regiments
could
not
fail
to
have
many
lady
friends
in
edinburgh
but
to
have
been
seen
twice
in
the
same
place
with
the
same
girl
at
the
same
time
and
apparently
expected
there
a
time
was
a
little
peculiar
and
apt
to
cause
eveline
to
speculate
upon
it
unpleasantly
was
this
companionship
a
matter
of
daily
occurrence
or
was
he
amid
the
enforced
separation
from
herself
beginning
to
replace
her
image
by
another
already
already
the
tenderness
of
their
last
meeting
in
the
at
maviswood
seemed
to
preclude
this
cruel
idea
and
to
the
hope
that
tenderness
inspired
she
clung
most
lovingly
thus
as
yet
she
did
not
speak
of
the
matter
to
her
cousin
olive
who
full
of
her
own
and
her
happiness
might
not
have
sympathised
with
her
as
once
she
would
have
done
and
to
add
to
her
trouble
in
a
little
time
she
would
have
her
old
admirer
beside
her
again
as
the
member
for
was
making
arrangements
to
pair
off
with
another
and
would
soon
be
able
to
leave
london
however
some
happiness
was
in
store
for
her
still
cameron
to
do
him
justice
spent
too
much
of
his
spare
time
in
hovering
about
the
vicinity
of
maviswood
not
to
be
rewarded
thus
one
clear
bright
afternoon
in
a
lovely
and
lonely
green
lane
where
the
holly
hedges
grew
close
and
darkly
where
the
wood
violets
spread
their
velvet
leaves
on
the
sunny
banks
and
where
the
mavis
and
merle
sang
they
suddenly
met
each
other
as
he
came
walking
slowly
along
on
foot
leading
his
horse
by
the
bridle
which
was
flung
over
his
arm
his
heart
was
so
full
of
her
that
when
he
met
her
suddenly
face
to
face
thus
he
scarcely
evinced
surprise
while
tremulously
she
put
both
her
hands
into
his
darling
at
last
at
last
no
eye
was
upon
them
there
as
his
arms
went
round
her
and
in
the
great
joy
of
seeing
him
of
meeting
him
thus
the
two
occasions
on
which
she
had
seen
him
with
another
promenading
slowly
under
the
trees
in
princes
street
were
forgotten
and
committed
to
oblivion
though
ere
long
they
were
to
be
roughly
brought
to
her
memory
evan
such
long
such
unexpected
joy
she
exclaimed
as
hand
in
hand
they
gazed
into
each
other
eyes
indeed
my
own
one
i
had
begun
to
fear
we
might
never
meet
again
and
i
shall
not
leave
you
now
but
with
the
assurance
that
we
shall
meet
as
often
as
we
can
till
till
evan
regiment
marches
marches
for
the
east
as
it
is
sure
to
do
before
long
eveline
you
must
be
out
in
the
garden
in
the
grounds
often
can
i
not
meet
you
there
or
here
again
she
shook
her
head
sadly
and
looked
at
him
lovingly
and
imploringly
meetings
in
secret
without
permission
would
be
wrong
evan
said
she
who
will
give
it
whom
what
have
we
to
consult
but
our
own
hearts
he
continued
passionately
may
have
but
little
time
less
than
we
reckon
on
now
for
the
interchange
of
love
and
joy
my
dear
one
and
meet
me
you
shall
you
he
added
as
he
folded
her
to
his
breast
and
covered
her
sweet
passive
face
with
kisses
while
something
of
hostility
and
defiance
at
her
whole
family
and
at
sir
paget
welled
up
in
his
heart
will
meet
me
again
he
urged
she
replied
in
a
scarcely
audible
whisper
it
could
be
no
sin
no
crime
if
an
error
to
meet
one
who
loved
her
so
well
as
evan
did
and
whom
she
loved
so
dearly
too
it
could
not
harm
her
elderly
adorer
from
whose
image
just
then
she
shrank
with
intense
loathing
and
if
it
was
a
wrong
against
her
parents
surely
they
were
in
error
to
coerce
her
she
thought
on
the
other
hand
the
temptation
was
great
the
joy
of
meeting
evan
would
end
sadly
and
bitterly
when
as
he
said
the
regiment
departed
and
after
that
they
might
never
see
each
other
more
waters
are
sweet
and
bread
eaten
in
secret
is
pleasant
say
the
scriptures
and
not
less
sweet
and
pleasant
were
the
interviews
that
might
be
stolen
thus
in
a
green
and
lonely
lane
help
me
and
direct
me
thought
the
girl
as
she
nestled
her
face
in
cameron
neck
and
yielding
to
the
natural
impulses
of
her
own
heart
promised
to
meet
him
again
and
again
when
time
and
opportunity
served
and
they
did
so
in
the
lane
between
the
holly
hedges
by
the
rural
woodland
road
that
deep
between
the
hills
leads
to
ravelston
quarry
and
haunted
craigcrook
and
at
times
near
the
old
church
where
the
buried
forresters
lie
under
their
altar
tombs
with
shield
on
arm
and
sword
at
side
and
as
the
days
went
on
each
meeting
as
it
seemed
to
take
place
without
suspicion
or
discovery
served
to
cement
their
hearts
together
more
and
more
but
once
when
evan
was
riding
home
in
the
dusk
in
the
vicinity
of
maviswood
he
passed
a
wayfarer
afoot
in
whose
face
he
thought
he
recognised
nay
was
certain
he
saw
the
features
of
holcroft
thought
evan
man
to
guard
against
by
jove
what
can
be
about
in
this
neighbourhood
what
but
mischief
he
wheeled
his
horse
round
but
the
man
he
had
seen
had
stepped
over
a
stile
and
disappeared
chapter
ix
my
lady
aberfeldie
was
all
unconscious
of
the
little
romance
that
had
been
going
on
for
some
weeks
past
in
the
green
lanes
and
wooded
paths
near
maviswood
while
eveline
seemed
now
but
to
live
for
the
purpose
of
meeting
evan
cameron
and
her
loving
heart
and
busy
little
head
were
full
of
cunning
schemes
and
contrivances
to
escape
detection
and
achieve
their
meetings
which
now
seemed
to
make
the
whole
sense
of
her
existence
and
when
not
with
evan
or
if
they
failed
which
was
seldom
to
see
each
other
even
for
a
few
minutes
her
manner
became
abstracted
and
triste
but
a
rude
awakening
from
her
joyous
dreams
was
at
hand
and
certain
past
events
that
seemed
trivial
in
themselves
were
doomed
to
be
recalled
to
her
with
a
new
and
terrible
significance
they
had
one
more
than
usually
tender
meeting
and
tender
parting
because
sir
paget
puddicombe
the
the
bugbear
of
both
was
certainly
coming
to
maviswood
and
eveline
was
weeping
bitterly
courage
take
courage
my
darling
said
evan
as
he
kissed
the
tears
from
her
eyes
and
strained
her
to
his
breast
before
he
leaped
on
his
horse
my
sake
and
your
own
have
strength
to
resist
and
all
may
yet
be
well
for
my
sake
and
your
own
dearest
alice
he
added
with
quivering
lips
and
was
gone
another
name
uttered
by
his
lips
involuntarily
while
his
heart
seemed
to
be
teeming
with
tenderness
for
herself
uttered
in
that
moment
of
supreme
sorrow
passion
and
endearment
escaped
him
mechanically
as
it
were
yet
too
evidently
by
use
and
wont
what
did
it
mean
what
could
it
mean
but
one
thing
her
heart
stood
still
for
a
moment
and
then
beat
wildly
she
did
not
hear
the
noise
of
his
horse
hoofs
dying
away
in
the
distance
nor
did
she
see
his
lessening
figure
for
the
powers
of
hearing
and
of
vision
seemed
to
fail
her
she
had
received
a
cruel
and
terrible
shock
had
she
heard
aright
or
was
it
all
a
delusion
of
her
ear
yet
she
repeated
to
herself
with
pallid
face
and
quivering
lips
the
word
while
memory
flashed
back
to
the
girl
she
had
seen
thrice
twice
with
evan
and
once
evidently
waiting
for
him
at
what
seemed
their
she
remembered
that
the
second
time
she
had
seen
them
they
were
walking
silently
together
full
of
their
own
thoughts
apparently
and
making
no
effort
to
entertain
each
other
and
she
had
read
that
it
is
only
nearest
and
dearest
of
kinships
the
closest
and
sweetest
of
human
intimacies
that
could
explain
such
wordless
proximity
strangers
acquaintances
when
thrown
together
politely
talk
brother
and
sister
husband
and
wife
may
be
confidently
blessedly
silent
she
remembered
now
with
ready
suspicion
that
when
she
and
evan
first
met
suddenly
afterwards
he
scarcely
evinced
surprise
we
have
said
that
it
was
because
his
heart
was
full
of
her
image
but
this
idea
this
hope
did
not
occur
to
eveline
then
her
mind
was
a
chaos
how
she
got
through
the
remainder
of
that
day
she
never
knew
she
had
but
one
wish
to
shun
her
mother
eye
to
seclude
herself
in
her
own
room
would
attract
attention
thus
she
remained
in
the
and
affected
to
read
she
opened
a
book
at
the
page
and
point
where
she
had
last
left
off
alas
it
was
beyond
the
power
of
books
to
soothe
or
win
her
from
herself
now
the
lethean
power
of
the
novelist
had
departed
and
her
whole
mind
seemed
out
of
tune
she
threw
aside
the
volume
and
took
up
another
but
a
cry
escaped
her
as
it
fell
from
her
hands
it
was
bulwer
or
the
mysteries
the
name
seemed
to
enter
her
heart
like
a
knife
and
she
rushed
away
to
her
room
the
for
dinner
when
it
rang
found
her
very
pale
and
wrestling
as
it
were
with
a
strange
and
unusual
pain
that
was
eating
its
way
into
her
heart
she
bathed
her
face
again
and
again
but
failed
to
hide
the
dark
shadows
under
her
eyes
or
the
inflammation
of
their
delicate
lids
and
at
that
evening
an
additional
stab
was
given
to
her
in
the
most
casual
and
unexpected
way
her
father
had
brought
from
his
club
to
maviswood
carslogie
of
the
black
watch
a
heedless
and
thoughtless
young
fellow
of
whom
she
overheard
allan
making
some
inquiries
concerning
cameron
of
stratherroch
strath
is
jolly
as
a
sandboy
replied
carslogie
he
has
some
mysterious
affair
of
the
heart
on
just
now
the
usual
way
there
is
a
pretty
girl
he
goes
about
with
to
all
public
places
but
introduces
to
no
one
she
is
without
a
chaperone
and
no
one
knows
whether
she
is
maid
wife
or
widow
funny
by
jove
is
it
carslogie
said
this
in
a
low
voice
to
allan
yet
not
so
low
but
that
it
reached
the
ears
of
eveline
who
had
some
difficulty
in
concealing
her
agitation
with
instinctive
tenderness
allan
glanced
at
his
sister
and
skilfully
changed
the
subject
to
the
then
invariable
topic
of
arabi
pasha
and
coming
row
in
egypt
times
there
were
when
she
had
thought
that
she
would
condescend
to
go
once
again
to
their
and
seek
an
explanation
but
now
after
what
carslogie
had
said
wild
horses
should
not
drag
her
there
she
would
never
upbraid
evan
with
his
baseness
never
more
would
she
go
there
she
would
simply
tear
his
image
out
of
her
heart
and
let
the
matter
end
but
this
was
easier
to
say
than
to
achieve
her
soul
seemed
to
have
become
numbed
within
her
frozen
if
we
may
use
such
terms
even
in
the
matter
of
sir
paget
she
was
conscious
now
of
feeling
neither
repugnance
nor
ridicule
though
she
felt
a
little
repentance
at
her
opposition
to
the
wishes
of
her
father
and
mother
and
for
the
duplicity
of
which
she
had
been
guilty
towards
them
in
her
love
for
an
unworthy
object
and
meeting
him
in
secret
as
if
she
had
been
a
or
and
not
the
daughter
of
a
peer
and
putting
herself
perhaps
in
an
equivocal
position
she
confided
in
olive
otherwise
her
heart
she
thought
would
burst
heart
is
said
to
be
deceitful
above
all
things
and
desperately
wicked
said
olive
i
must
confess
that
this
affair
passes
my
comprehension
he
can
not
be
in
love
with
at
once
yet
i
have
read
of
such
things
forget
him
you
must
do
that
at
least
you
endure
too
much
eveline
you
believed
in
him
too
much
and
i
fear
hoped
too
much
even
friendship
has
its
limits
how
much
more
so
love
but
yesterday
i
was
so
happy
happy
in
a
love
the
end
of
which
i
could
not
foresee
wailed
poor
eveline
on
her
cousin
bosom
what
was
she
like
this
alice
her
rival
oh
disgrace
fair
or
dark
she
remembered
that
she
was
pale
and
pretty
but
what
did
it
matter
thought
the
now
crushed
girl
as
she
tossed
feverishly
on
her
pillow
in
the
gloom
and
solitude
of
the
night
when
even
our
thoughts
seem
to
assume
distinct
outlines
that
become
sharp
and
vivid
night
had
passed
a
new
day
dawned
and
how
far
far
off
seemed
yesterday
the
sun
had
risen
in
his
glory
the
blackbirds
were
singing
in
the
shrubberies
of
maviswood
and
the
pale
mists
were
clearing
off
torduff
and
kirkyetton
craig
the
highest
summits
of
the
lovely
pentlands
it
was
late
ere
eveline
had
wept
herself
to
sleep
but
to
her
it
seemed
as
if
she
had
not
slept
at
all
thus
it
was
proportionately
late
when
she
awoke
heavily
to
the
morning
of
a
new
day
she
had
given
her
whole
soul
with
joy
to
her
hopeless
love
for
evan
hopeless
but
pure
though
any
happy
end
to
it
she
could
not
foresee
but
this
was
a
bitter
collapse
she
did
not
anticipate
and
now
her
was
gone
was
she
the
same
eveline
graham
who
but
yesterday
morning
shook
off
sleep
so
lightly
and
rose
fresh
strong
and
full
of
hope
with
the
conviction
that
her
secret
lover
was
true
to
her
and
to
this
hopeless
passion
her
affectionate
heart
was
crushed
her
was
in
the
dust
her
proud
head
lay
low
indeed
and
for
the
first
time
in
her
young
life
she
had
learned
what
it
is
to
be
cut
to
the
soul
to
be
completely
humbled
and
alice
who
and
what
was
oh
olive
how
am
i
to
meet
mamma
was
the
first
exclamation
after
they
had
got
rid
of
mademoiselle
clairette
she
knew
she
would
have
to
join
in
the
conversation
of
the
when
all
her
vigilance
would
be
requisite
to
prevent
her
from
of
suspicious
silence
or
confusion
of
manner
with
the
helpless
air
and
uncertain
voice
of
one
who
seeks
to
conceal
a
new
and
hitherto
unknown
sorrow
and
to
undergo
with
her
sad
white
humiliated
face
her
mother
critical
and
observant
eyes
if
in
desperation
she
did
not
act
a
part
that
watchful
mother
would
be
sure
to
detect
a
change
and
that
there
was
something
wrong
eveline
knew
well
that
she
would
soon
detect
every
flicker
of
her
eyelashes
every
tremor
of
the
heavy
white
lids
that
would
droop
in
spite
of
her
now
but
luckily
lady
aberfeldie
was
busy
in
her
boudoir
with
the
housekeeper
and
tappleton
the
butler
giving
orders
for
sir
paget
puddicombe
would
arrive
ere
long
carslogie
had
gone
back
to
edinburgh
of
course
last
night
he
would
be
with
evan
cameron
this
morning
on
parade
and
so
forth
would
the
latter
question
him
about
his
visit
to
maviswood
about
perhaps
but
what
did
it
matter
now
whether
he
did
so
or
did
not
nothing
less
than
nothing
how
long
the
hours
seemed
now
when
they
were
empty
empty
of
all
but
bitterness
meanwhile
days
passed
on
and
cameron
came
as
was
his
wont
to
the
usual
places
of
meeting
but
eveline
was
never
there
what
had
happened
how
was
she
detained
had
an
illness
come
upon
her
his
mind
was
a
prey
to
the
keenest
anxiety
which
he
was
without
the
means
of
allaying
he
could
not
write
to
ask
for
any
explanation
neither
could
he
call
at
maviswood
after
the
somewhat
studied
coldness
of
his
last
reception
there
by
her
father
and
mother
at
each
place
and
spot
where
so
lately
they
had
met
and
wandered
the
thoughts
that
found
utterance
there
and
many
a
tender
caress
came
potently
and
poignantly
back
to
memory
now
where
was
she
what
doing
how
engaged
and
with
whom
in
sickness
or
in
health
he
asked
of
himself
with
endless
iteration
trivialities
are
often
associated
with
the
greatest
eventualities
in
our
lives
thus
long
in
the
memory
of
evan
would
his
last
visit
to
one
of
these
beloved
spots
be
associated
with
the
shrill
notes
of
a
mavis
perched
upon
the
topmost
bough
of
a
tree
ignorant
as
yet
of
what
he
himself
had
done
ignorant
also
of
the
mischief
his
friend
carslogie
had
unintentionally
done
him
by
retailing
some
gossip
in
the
vagueness
of
his
thoughts
and
ideas
of
the
whole
situation
which
we
shall
unravel
cameron
was
inclined
to
attribute
the
total
cessation
of
meetings
with
him
to
some
mysterious
influence
of
hawke
holcroft
if
holcroft
it
was
whom
he
saw
in
the
dusk
from
carslogie
he
learned
that
was
looking
well
and
jolly
as
he
phrased
it
when
allan
rejoined
he
would
hear
more
of
her
he
hoped
but
allan
sick
leave
was
protracted
from
time
to
time
and
none
seemed
to
know
he
would
be
with
the
regiment
again
once
these
parted
lovers
saw
each
other
but
for
a
moment
only
accompanied
by
a
groom
eveline
rode
at
a
canter
past
him
on
a
lonely
part
of
the
road
near
maviswood
her
eyes
full
of
unshed
tears
her
face
pale
with
resentment
and
her
veil
in
her
teeth
past
him
as
if
he
was
a
stranger
stop
to
speak
or
expect
an
explanation
thought
the
girl
this
world
do
not
actions
speak
louder
a
thousand
times
than
words
can
ever
do
she
was
a
graham
of
dundargue
and
would
show
him
that
she
was
not
of
the
kind
of
stuff
that
facile
amelias
or
patient
griseldas
are
made
yet
to
pass
him
by
thus
cost
her
a
mighty
effort
though
to
eveline
it
seemed
that
there
was
nothing
left
for
her
now
to
wrestle
valiantly
with
that
pain
which
in
the
world
eye
degrades
the
woman
who
smarts
under
it
the
pain
of
an
unshared
love
chapter
x
mysteries
of
udolpho
stratherroch
seems
to
have
accepted
the
situation
he
is
much
too
sharp
and
a
man
not
to
have
seen
that
he
was
well
in
the
way
rather
said
lady
aberfeldie
to
her
husband
one
afternoon
thing
is
certain
at
least
he
has
ceased
to
visit
here
out
of
the
hunt
yes
assented
the
peer
as
he
filled
and
lit
his
fellow
he
was
or
is
undoubtedly
fond
of
our
little
girl
fondness
was
folly
in
one
so
poor
and
now
as
sir
paget
comes
i
do
not
see
why
we
should
not
have
the
two
marriages
at
once
i
am
most
anxious
to
have
all
this
fuss
ended
and
done
with
are
several
deeds
to
draw
and
so
forth
in
the
matter
of
allan
and
olive
and
as
for
eveline
she
has
not
yet
consented
must
do
so
now
i
presume
said
lady
aberfeldie
impatiently
wafting
aside
with
her
white
hand
a
cloud
of
smoke
the
peer
was
creating
marriages
said
he
reflectively
how
if
the
regiment
goes
on
foreign
service
and
the
corps
expects
orders
of
readiness
daily
i
understand
can
send
in
his
papers
you
do
not
consider
what
you
say
is
not
well
enough
to
go
abroad
is
too
well
to
remain
behind
and
if
well
enough
to
marry
i
fear
that
the
will
deem
him
well
enough
to
march
it
will
secure
olive
fortune
in
the
family
is
secured
as
it
is
by
her
father
will
so
long
as
allan
is
willing
to
consent
but
as
our
loving
there
will
be
no
necessity
for
the
enforcement
of
the
clause
that
is
so
grotesque
as
regards
sir
paget
and
eveline
me
to
manage
eveline
said
lady
aberfeldie
bluntly
and
loftily
the
result
of
her
management
was
soon
apparent
though
she
knew
not
that
circumstances
of
which
she
was
as
yet
unaware
were
playing
into
her
hands
and
would
yet
more
completely
do
so
paget
as
you
know
eveline
will
be
here
said
she
with
an
arm
round
her
daughter
neck
we
that
is
your
papa
and
i
trust
child
that
you
will
receive
him
as
you
ought
and
wear
the
jewels
he
sent
you
lady
aberfeldie
used
her
softest
yet
firmest
voice
as
she
spoke
to
eveline
but
it
sounded
to
the
latter
as
the
voice
of
one
who
was
a
long
long
way
off
she
made
no
immediate
reply
but
with
her
hands
tightly
interlaced
as
if
thereby
she
would
quell
emotion
seemed
to
be
gazing
down
at
her
nicely
pointed
little
foot
that
rested
on
a
velvet
mope
here
growing
pale
and
thin
for
a
thing
without
substance
a
dream
a
shadow
eveline
you
understand
me
dream
a
shadow
indeed
mamma
hear
me
child
said
her
mother
mamma
replied
eveline
who
seemed
to
shiver
with
cold
as
her
mother
left
her
but
with
a
long
backward
glance
that
had
more
of
menace
than
entreaty
in
it
never
loved
me
eveline
was
thinking
have
given
my
heart
for
nothing
and
am
now
cast
aside
for
another
like
a
broken
toy
discarded
by
a
child
he
dared
to
trifle
with
me
my
daughter
it
is
clear
now
that
he
fancied
or
merely
pretended
to
be
in
love
with
me
while
all
the
time
his
heart
was
given
to
and
she
would
have
been
either
more
or
less
than
human
if
with
her
just
indignation
there
did
not
mingle
a
certain
sentiment
of
revenge
that
bore
her
up
in
the
part
she
meant
to
act
now
though
she
shrank
as
yet
from
the
conviction
that
when
esteem
dies
love
dies
with
it
so
that
evening
eveline
wore
the
suite
of
jewels
such
jewels
as
bond
street
alone
can
furnish
and
sir
paget
as
he
sat
by
her
side
jerked
his
little
bald
head
about
in
the
exuberance
of
joy
and
in
a
way
that
was
really
alarming
olive
was
looking
radiantly
beautiful
in
a
brilliant
dinner
costume
with
allan
maltese
suite
of
diamonds
and
pearls
sparkling
on
her
neck
and
arms
which
lady
aberfeldie
had
urged
her
to
don
in
honour
of
sir
paget
and
in
defiance
of
a
and
pitiful
glance
of
eveline
who
had
no
small
difficulty
in
acquitting
herself
at
dinner
in
her
new
role
of
but
nearly
broke
down
when
she
heard
sir
paget
raise
his
voice
and
say
to
her
father
something
that
he
was
not
sorry
he
might
say
with
a
clear
conscience
and
as
a
by
the
way
aberfeldie
when
i
arrived
at
the
rail
this
morning
i
witnessed
a
very
tender
between
a
young
friend
of
yours
and
a
most
charming
girl
gad
the
fellow
has
taste
a
girl
whom
he
was
seeing
off
to
london
i
presume
by
the
flying
scotsman
it
was
quite
pathetic
by
jove
young
friend
of
ours
who
do
you
mean
sir
paget
asked
lady
aberfeldie
of
the
black
watch
whom
i
had
the
pleasure
of
meeting
at
dundargue
you
remember
said
sir
paget
playing
with
the
stem
of
his
and
not
daring
to
look
at
eveline
whose
white
hand
he
saw
trembling
as
she
toyed
with
her
grapes
oh
indeed
and
the
young
lady
cameron
painted
on
all
her
luggage
great
indian
overlands
some
of
it
repeated
lady
aberfeldie
whose
aristocratic
face
shone
in
spite
of
herself
at
these
tidings
while
lord
aberfeldie
looked
flushed
and
perplexed
and
like
allan
who
pitied
his
poor
sister
remained
silent
this
astounding
intelligence
was
to
poor
eveline
as
last
to
the
camel
she
betrayed
no
outward
emotion
though
her
heart
and
spirit
were
completely
broken
down
for
a
phase
of
duplicity
which
she
could
never
have
conceived
was
now
suddenly
laid
bare
to
her
when
with
her
aunt
and
cousin
she
retired
to
the
the
latter
pressed
her
hand
affectionately
and
caressingly
while
the
former
too
proud
or
too
prudent
to
refer
to
what
they
had
just
heard
so
greatly
to
her
satisfaction
sat
in
a
shady
corner
and
slowly
fanned
herself
in
silence
with
a
great
round
feather
fan
an
emotion
of
jealous
spite
at
young
cameron
with
rivalry
passion
and
ambition
to
possess
a
young
beautiful
and
wife
all
now
inspired
sir
paget
who
to
do
him
justice
in
the
anecdote
he
had
told
had
told
no
more
than
the
truth
and
for
the
happiness
of
evan
cameron
we
are
sorry
to
say
it
but
though
now
permitting
herself
quietly
to
drift
with
the
stream
of
events
and
to
become
a
tool
in
the
hands
of
others
it
was
impossible
for
eveline
when
with
sir
paget
in
the
grounds
or
when
alone
in
the
not
to
shrink
from
his
now
privileged
caresses
and
attentions
thus
once
she
shocked
him
by
saying
as
she
withdrew
her
hands
from
his
clasp
sir
paget
do
you
really
mean
to
marry
a
woman
who
does
not
and
never
can
love
you
not
say
never
can
how
can
we
know
what
the
future
may
have
for
me
for
my
dear
girl
indeed
save
one
sighed
the
girl
wearily
would
rather
have
half
your
heart
than
the
whole
of
any
other
woman
said
sir
paget
gallantly
while
recapturing
her
hands
and
jerking
out
his
head
in
turtle
fashion
whole
heart
thought
eveline
oh
no
was
full
of
evan
but
can
have
no
vacant
corner
for
any
other
especially
such
a
man
as
this
and
even
while
she
thought
this
she
shivered
as
if
with
cold
when
in
right
of
his
new
position
he
caressed
her
with
all
their
innate
pride
papa
and
mamma
are
content
to
abandon
me
to
this
absurd
little
man
puddicombe
as
they
do
passes
my
comprehension
said
she
to
olive
such
an
absurd
name
too
she
added
with
a
little
laugh
that
was
hysterical
what
object
can
the
splendour
of
his
settlements
be
to
them
they
seem
to
ignore
the
fact
that
the
grahams
of
dundargue
were
barons
of
the
scottish
parliament
when
the
ancestors
of
half
the
british
peerage
were
hewers
of
wood
and
drawers
of
water
peasantry
and
artisans
so
in
the
bloom
of
her
youth
and
beauty
the
time
the
light
that
surrounds
us
is
all
from
within
eveline
graham
was
to
become
a
victim
at
the
altar
after
all
after
all
and
cameron
seemed
to
have
prepared
the
path
for
her
for
stunned
by
his
too
apparent
duplicity
she
schooled
herself
for
the
of
indifference
to
fate
but
this
was
chiefly
by
day
for
often
at
night
she
would
lie
where
she
had
thrown
herself
across
her
bed
forgetting
even
to
undress
her
face
covered
by
her
soft
arm
and
so
in
the
morning
the
wondering
and
sympathising
clairette
would
find
her
june
was
creeping
on
now
with
its
sunny
fragrant
breath
there
were
white
and
purple
blossoms
in
the
parterres
of
the
garden
the
graceful
laburnums
were
dropping
their
golden
petals
in
showers
over
the
rosebuds
and
green
lawns
that
were
bordered
by
dark
shining
myrtles
and
laurels
and
rhododendrons
from
the
fields
came
the
rasping
sound
made
by
the
mower
as
he
whetted
his
scythe
before
which
the
rich
feathered
grass
and
the
wild
flowers
are
done
to
death
elsewhere
the
joyous
haymakers
were
hard
at
work
and
the
dust
of
june
began
to
roll
along
the
roads
before
the
wind
in
the
sunshine
thought
eveline
will
the
winter
find
me
the
preparations
for
her
marriage
were
hurried
on
with
a
rapidity
that
appalled
her
but
dear
as
the
scheme
was
to
lady
aberfeldie
a
somewhat
unexpected
event
delayed
that
of
allan
and
olive
raymond
and
gave
the
aberfeldie
family
once
more
something
else
to
think
of
one
evening
when
all
the
others
were
in
edinburgh
save
himself
and
olive
for
eveline
forthcoming
marriage
kept
all
rather
busy
now
allan
full
of
his
own
happy
thoughts
and
the
joy
that
would
be
his
ere
long
was
smoking
in
the
grounds
when
he
was
startled
by
a
shrill
cry
that
proceeded
from
an
open
window
of
the
house
a
french
window
that
opened
to
the
ground
and
swift
as
light
a
man
dashed
past
him
and
disappeared
among
the
thick
shrubberies
thief
was
allan
first
thought
whose
cry
was
that
was
his
second
the
face
of
the
intruder
who
passed
near
him
a
pale
and
familiar
one
seen
just
as
cameron
had
before
seen
it
seemed
to
be
that
of
hawke
holcroft
thought
allan
as
he
hurried
towards
the
house
but
it
was
not
until
he
had
further
proofs
that
he
became
aware
that
the
face
he
had
seen
the
face
of
was
that
of
holcroft
he
hurried
into
the
apartment
through
the
open
window
and
was
horrified
to
find
olive
prostrate
on
the
floor
with
her
arms
outspread
and
in
a
fainting
condition
he
raised
her
up
and
laid
her
on
a
sofa
withdrawing
the
pillow
from
under
her
head
and
looked
round
for
water
to
lave
her
face
and
hands
one
of
which
clutched
a
pen
a
large
sealskin
cigar
case
with
rio
hondo
cigars
in
it
a
case
which
he
well
remembered
to
have
seen
in
possession
of
holcroft
lay
upon
the
floor
how
came
it
there
unless
the
man
he
saw
was
beyond
all
doubt
hawke
holcroft
olive
for
she
had
a
bank
account
of
her
own
lay
open
on
her
davenport
and
allan
eye
caught
the
counterfoil
of
one
dated
that
very
day
and
almost
wet
still
for
hundred
pounds
he
gasped
and
tried
to
tear
open
his
necktie
while
the
room
swam
round
him
god
can
it
be
that
she
is
playing
fast
and
loose
with
me
and
that
villain
that
she
should
have
any
intercourse
verbal
or
written
with
such
a
wretch
excited
in
allan
a
gust
of
rage
and
bewilderment
disgust
horror
and
intense
perplexity
yet
it
might
be
all
quite
explainable
even
the
cheque
she
opened
her
eyes
and
closed
them
again
and
pathetically
he
besought
her
to
tell
him
what
had
happened
but
could
elicit
no
reply
her
slender
throat
seemed
parched
as
she
failed
to
articulate
olive
said
he
i
alarm
you
forgive
me
you
know
how
i
love
you
why
torture
me
by
this
silence
tell
me
all
has
happened
has
been
here
but
he
urged
and
pled
in
vain
her
teeth
were
clenched
it
some
folly
some
girlish
imprudence
is
it
dear
love
only
tell
me
still
she
was
silent
and
allan
brows
knit
darkly
and
ominously
while
in
the
excited
state
of
his
nerves
he
felt
sharp
twinges
in
the
arm
that
had
been
fractured
and
when
consciousness
came
partially
back
to
olive
she
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
and
sobbed
heavily
and
spasmodically
what
had
happened
why
was
she
so
suddenly
cast
down
hurled
as
it
were
from
the
joy
rapture
and
repose
of
an
hour
ago
to
the
apparent
agony
and
shame
of
the
present
nothing
could
be
elicited
from
her
and
the
next
day
found
her
in
a
species
of
hysterical
fever
and
in
the
hands
of
the
doctor
in
a
short
time
it
was
discovered
that
her
cheque
an
open
one
payable
to
hawke
holcroft
and
duly
endorsed
by
that
personage
had
been
presented
and
cashed
at
a
bank
yet
no
explanation
could
be
elicited
from
her
about
it
had
on
the
diamonds
mother
said
allan
interrogatively
was
this
lent
them
to
her
as
the
bride
of
the
house
and
doubtless
she
had
been
trying
them
on
when
when
scoundrel
thrust
himself
upon
her
presence
suppose
so
said
lady
aberfeldie
weeping
always
comes
of
these
accursed
stones
is
simply
outrageous
said
lord
aberfeldie
sternly
and
loftily
even
the
family
of
the
most
humble
tradesman
should
be
haunted
by
a
frankenstein
a
swindler
and
worse
like
this
but
that
a
house
like
mine
the
house
of
a
peer
of
the
realm
and
his
lordship
in
his
indignation
paused
as
utterance
failed
him
is
involved
here
exclaimed
lady
aberfeldie
i
dislike
it
intensely
as
vulgar
and
very
bad
style
jove
i
should
think
so
added
allan
gloomily
this
affair
like
cameron
marriage
beats
the
mysteries
of
udolpho
chapter
xi
and
what
came
of
it
and
now
ere
it
is
too
late
to
let
a
little
light
on
what
must
seem
a
mystery
and
to
tell
a
story
which
eveline
was
not
to
hear
until
the
fatal
die
was
cast
evan
said
a
handsome
girl
as
she
interlaced
her
slender
fingers
on
cameron
arm
lovingly
in
one
of
the
most
secluded
walks
of
the
gardens
and
under
the
shadow
of
the
towering
castle
rock
can
not
bear
to
see
you
looking
so
unhappy
what
the
matter
graham
has
ceased
to
meet
me
she
is
ill
or
or
i
know
not
what
can
not
you
ascertain
i
have
no
means
of
ascertaining
moreover
only
the
other
day
she
cut
me
you
passed
you
me
dead
that
was
bad
in
taste
cruel
too
so
unlike
her
alice
darling
that
i
know
not
what
to
think
has
resolved
to
accept
her
rich
old
baronet
that
is
all
and
i
shall
hear
all
about
it
when
i
am
far
away
from
you
in
india
how
strange
added
the
girl
dreamily
while
a
great
yet
pensive
joy
lighted
up
her
blue
eyes
strange
to
think
that
i
am
still
in
edinburgh
and
so
far
away
from
when
there
was
a
time
when
i
wondered
if
anyone
in
this
world
was
ever
so
happy
as
i
when
dear
stupid
duncan
asked
me
to
be
his
wife
and
oh
evan
dear
but
for
you
and
your
great
kindness
to
us
my
heart
must
have
broken
and
i
should
never
have
seen
duncan
more
the
fair
speaker
was
the
alice
whose
name
had
unconsciously
escaped
evan
as
his
heart
was
full
of
a
great
love
and
pity
for
her
the
wife
of
his
younger
brother
duncan
from
whom
she
had
been
separated
in
consequence
of
a
foolish
jealous
quarrel
and
having
been
through
that
sent
home
by
him
from
india
had
no
other
friend
in
europe
to
whom
to
turn
for
succour
and
support
than
the
but
laird
of
stratherroch
who
had
at
last
effected
an
explanation
and
reconciliation
between
them
when
quartered
in
cantonments
in
the
first
year
of
their
marriage
not
far
from
hurdwar
on
the
ganges
where
allan
got
the
idol
he
gave
to
olive
there
seemed
to
be
no
more
loving
and
attached
couple
than
duncan
cameron
and
his
little
wife
alice
and
both
were
prime
favourites
with
the
garrison
he
for
his
fine
bearing
which
made
him
the
pattern
officer
of
his
regiment
a
bengal
infantry
corps
his
skill
in
horsemanship
as
a
marksman
and
pigsticker
and
his
general
and
good
nature
she
for
her
beauty
and
sweetness
her
great
abundance
of
animal
spirits
and
a
charming
that
made
her
the
object
of
attention
from
all
ladies
were
scarce
in
these
cantonments
so
far
country
and
thus
alice
proved
a
wonderful
attraction
to
all
the
young
subs
at
the
or
on
the
racecourse
and
elsewhere
and
they
hovered
about
her
rather
more
than
duncan
cameron
quite
relished
she
was
a
leading
feature
at
all
the
entertainments
given
by
sir
bevis
batardeau
the
brigadier
and
his
wife
and
indeed
no
ball
picnic
or
dance
was
deemed
complete
without
the
presence
of
alice
cameron
now
sir
bevis
was
a
notorious
old
and
the
cause
of
much
as
scandal
or
gossip
is
called
in
india
he
was
a
man
of
fashion
grizzled
and
rather
bald
with
a
reddish
nose
and
wicked
eyes
while
lady
batardeau
his
senior
by
a
year
or
two
was
a
kind
and
motherly
woman
who
loved
alice
dearly
and
of
course
asserted
that
the
general
did
so
too
in
a
fashion
of
his
own
and
many
things
were
said
that
never
reached
as
yet
the
ears
of
duncan
cameron
the
latter
was
sent
to
some
distance
from
the
cantonments
on
a
particular
duty
and
poor
alice
was
left
to
mope
in
her
bungalow
alone
often
thought
she
said
anything
should
ever
separate
us
i
would
die
the
fear
smote
me
like
a
sword
point
evan
and
the
night
duncan
left
me
a
jackal
howled
fearfully
in
the
compound
was
it
ominous
of
evil
i
fear
so
for
separated
terribly
we
were
fated
to
be
through
no
fault
of
mine
these
forebodings
made
her
pass
sleeplessly
the
hot
and
breathless
indian
nights
while
hourly
the
cantonment
were
clanged
and
the
jackals
howled
in
the
prickly
hedges
and
the
mosquitoes
seemed
a
thousand
times
more
annoying
no
chowrie
would
whisk
them
out
of
the
muslin
curtains
and
her
breakfast
seemed
so
insipid
now
and
gunga
ram
the
or
native
butler
could
find
nothing
to
tempt
her
appetite
yet
gunga
though
like
most
hindostanees
doubtful
of
the
virtue
of
every
european
woman
was
devoted
to
his
own
particular
every
morning
she
had
been
wont
to
watch
at
the
open
venetian
blinds
of
their
bungalow
for
the
handsome
figure
of
duncan
returning
from
the
early
parade
while
the
sun
was
yet
on
the
verge
of
the
horizon
and
every
evening
was
spent
together
in
delicious
idleness
riding
on
the
course
promenading
by
the
or
wandering
among
the
groves
where
the
baubool
breathes
an
exquisite
perfume
from
its
bells
of
gold
as
the
oleander
does
from
its
clusters
of
pink
and
white
blossoms
and
where
the
lovely
little
sews
two
leaves
together
and
swings
in
his
nest
from
the
bough
of
some
little
tree
hourly
she
longed
for
the
return
of
duncan
she
was
a
petted
favourite
with
lady
batardeau
who
when
calling
on
her
one
day
found
her
asleep
under
the
verandah
outside
bungalow
on
a
long
low
indian
thinking
how
charming
the
looked
lady
batardeau
in
playful
kindness
slipped
on
one
of
her
fingers
a
ring
which
had
been
in
the
past
time
a
gift
to
herself
from
sir
bevis
when
she
valued
his
gifts
more
than
she
had
reason
to
do
now
and
having
done
this
she
went
softly
and
laughingly
away
to
the
joy
of
alice
cameron
returned
suddenly
while
she
was
yet
puzzling
herself
to
account
for
the
presence
of
the
ring
and
for
a
time
in
the
happiness
of
their
reunion
she
forgot
all
about
it
till
he
while
toying
with
her
pretty
hands
observed
it
on
her
finder
magnificent
ring
alice
said
he
did
it
come
from
is
more
than
i
can
tell
you
he
asked
found
that
it
had
been
slipped
on
my
finger
when
i
was
asleep
whom
can
not
say
duncan
dear
on
examining
the
jewel
he
saw
graven
on
the
inside
the
name
of
that
notorious
old
and
lothario
the
brigadier
lady
batardeau
had
left
the
cantonments
for
awhile
and
poor
alice
could
give
no
explanation
as
to
how
the
mysterious
ring
with
the
name
of
sir
bevis
thereon
came
to
be
on
her
finger
duncan
loved
her
so
trustfully
so
utterly
that
doubt
failed
for
a
time
to
find
a
place
in
his
gallant
heart
but
had
playfully
asserted
that
the
old
brigadier
immensely
admired
young
cameron
he
recalled
some
jests
he
had
heard
and
now
the
poison
they
breathed
was
stealing
upon
his
senses
and
his
face
grew
white
as
death
duncan
mistook
the
genuine
confusion
of
alice
for
guilt
her
dismay
for
dread
of
detection
and
the
whole
affair
for
a
feature
in
an
intrigue
he
knew
how
keen
and
bitter
was
scandal
in
india
and
already
he
saw
himself
a
source
of
mockery
and
disgrace
and
figuring
perhaps
in
the
columns
of
the
he
saw
it
all
now
he
had
been
sent
on
duty
to
a
distance
for
some
days
as
he
believed
out
of
his
turn
and
by
the
express
order
of
the
brigadier
that
circumstance
had
surprised
him
but
he
believed
it
was
fully
explained
now
by
finding
the
ring
of
sir
bevis
on
his
wife
finger
and
he
became
transported
with
fury
alice
cowered
for
a
time
beneath
the
expression
she
read
in
his
face
could
it
be
possible
he
thought
that
she
was
proving
as
one
of
the
apples
of
life
which
a
mocking
fate
so
often
throws
in
our
lap
charming
to
the
imagination
but
bitter
to
the
sense
said
alice
softly
and
imploringly
but
he
felt
all
the
mute
despair
of
a
broken
heart
the
agony
of
a
shaken
faith
and
he
put
her
soft
white
hands
gently
from
him
as
if
he
would
never
seek
them
in
this
life
again
he
at
once
sought
the
presence
of
the
brigadier
who
on
hearing
what
he
had
to
say
certainly
to
do
him
justice
was
rather
bewildered
beg
leave
sir
to
return
to
you
this
ring
said
duncan
tossing
it
contemptuously
on
the
table
ring
my
wife
ring
it
was
eh
captain
cameron
where
did
you
find
it
you
placed
it
i
doubt
not
do
not
understand
your
tone
and
manner
captain
cameron
but
i
certainly
placed
it
on
the
finger
my
wife
said
duncan
hoarsely
and
scornfully
thank
you
for
your
kind
attention
but
trust
that
it
will
end
here
ere
worse
come
of
it
i
am
not
a
man
to
be
trifled
with
sir
bevis
now
sir
bevis
had
no
dislike
to
be
thought
gay
lothario
a
sad
dog
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
so
he
actually
simpered
provokingly
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
said
deprecatingly
you
wrong
mrs
cameron
has
deceived
me
exclaimed
duncan
furiously
a
woman
ca
deceive
her
own
husband
may
she
deceive
asked
the
unwise
brigadier
the
days
of
the
pistol
this
matter
would
not
have
ended
here
come
do
let
you
and
i
fall
to
carte
and
tierce
in
this
fashion
said
the
general
may
be
explainable
want
no
explanations
you
please
it
seems
there
is
a
little
romance
in
most
lives
your
grey
hairs
you
should
have
outlived
all
that
i
think
now
his
years
proved
a
sore
point
with
old
sir
bevis
and
he
became
inflamed
with
anger
but
ere
he
could
retort
duncan
had
jerked
his
sword
under
his
left
arm
and
swept
from
his
presence
with
a
rather
withering
expression
in
his
face
and
that
very
evening
saw
alice
in
the
train
for
delhi
to
europe
i
suffer
all
the
shame
and
all
the
agony
of
guilt
oh
it
is
hard
duncan
very
very
hard
were
the
last
words
she
said
brokenly
to
her
husband
who
heard
her
with
a
stern
silence
that
astonished
her
now
that
lady
batardeau
on
her
return
to
the
cantonments
had
explained
the
whole
story
of
the
ring
duncan
was
when
too
late
for
his
wife
was
on
the
sea
full
of
shame
and
contrition
for
his
suspicions
and
severity
and
had
written
to
crave
the
pardon
of
alice
and
insure
her
return
to
him
again
hence
the
farewell
and
departure
of
cameron
with
her
overlands
and
other
baggage
as
witnessed
by
the
sharp
little
eyes
of
sir
paget
puddicombe
at
the
waverley
station
and
thus
it
was
that
by
an
unexplained
mistake
two
fond
hearts
were
separated
for
ever
but
separated
they
would
have
been
eventually
by
fate
or
fortune
the
lack
of
fortune
rather
as
time
may
show
but
for
a
time
poor
eveline
had
to
ponder
bitterly
on
the
humiliating
thought
that
evan
cameron
had
been
thinking
of
face
form
and
name
while
in
the
act
of
caressing
herself
and
that
the
other
was
as
sir
paget
had
left
them
no
reason
to
doubt
and
never
himself
doubted
evan
cameron

chapter

olive
visitor
another
mystery
has
now
to
be
accounted
for
the
state
in
which
allan
found
olive
when
her
cry
reached
him
as
he
idled
with
his
cigar
in
the
grounds
at
maviswood
in
the
evening
when
the
rest
of
the
family
circle
were
in
town
olive
was
seated
alone
in
one
of
the
when
a
gentleman
was
announced
a
gentleman
who
no
doubt
thought
allan
was
absent
in
edinburgh
also
holcroft
holcroft
a
book
she
was
reading
fell
from
the
hand
of
olive
and
she
started
to
her
feet
as
that
personage
hat
in
hand
stood
smilingly
before
her
for
a
moment
she
could
scarcely
believe
her
eyes
as
they
met
the
pale
watery
and
shifty
ones
of
her
unexpected
visitor
terror
and
horror
filled
her
heart
on
finding
herself
face
to
face
with
this
man
an
assassin
in
intent
it
was
too
horrible
too
and
grotesque
to
think
of
but
what
was
his
intention
now
she
was
not
left
long
in
ignorance
why
did
she
not
rush
to
the
bell
summon
the
household
and
have
the
daring
intruder
expelled
or
arrested
but
no
she
felt
a
very
coward
just
then
with
a
great
dread
of
allan
discovering
him
and
a
heavy
sickening
foreboding
of
coming
evil
there
came
dreamily
to
her
memory
too
some
threatening
words
of
his
when
he
had
said
that
he
would
let
no
man
come
between
them
and
that
though
he
might
fail
to
compel
her
to
love
him
he
might
compel
her
to
marry
him
but
neither
love
nor
marriage
were
in
the
mind
of
her
horrible
visitor
just
then
hawke
holcroft
seemed
rather
on
his
luck
and
looked
somewhat
shabby
and
seedy
the
last
fragment
of
his
patrimony
had
been
swallowed
up
his
had
proved
a
mistake
as
he
had
for
some
time
past
backed
the
wrong
horses
cards
had
failed
him
and
play
of
all
kinds
in
short
he
was
desperate
and
hence
his
appearance
at
maviswood
to
attempt
the
role
of
a
lover
again
after
all
that
had
passed
and
after
all
that
he
was
aware
must
be
known
to
miss
raymond
was
he
knew
impossible
but
he
had
a
trump
card
to
play
in
the
way
of
extortion
plain
blunt
rascally
extortion
so
conceiving
that
the
girl
was
utterly
alone
he
could
not
for
the
life
of
him
resist
bantering
her
a
little
all
the
more
as
the
utter
loathing
and
dread
her
face
expressed
enraged
him
holcroft
she
exclaimed
in
a
breathless
voice
as
she
recoiled
and
became
white
as
a
lily
hawke
holcroft
the
man
your
fatal
beauty
has
made
him
said
he
with
melodramatic
gloom
and
folded
arms
i
met
you
first
i
met
my
fate
a
love
that
was
my
doom
but
for
you
would
i
ever
have
been
mad
enough
to
attempt
the
life
of
allan
graham
dare
you
come
here
how
dare
you
speak
to
me
thus
said
olive
glancing
at
the
bell
handle
but
he
planted
himself
between
it
and
her
love
of
you
came
to
me
when
first
you
looked
into
my
face
he
resumed
in
his
melodramatic
style
remember
it
was
but
a
smile
a
smile
yet
a
mist
came
before
my
eyes
a
something
stirred
my
heart
ah
olive
raymond
it
was
your
beautiful
eyes
that
suddenly
kindled
new
life
within
me
that
will
only
end
with
the
old
olive
was
more
irritated
than
alarmed
now
dare
you
come
here
she
asked
ca
help
it
needs
must
when
old
boots
drives
said
he
came
to
show
you
a
work
of
art
look
here
from
his
he
drew
out
and
held
before
her
at
arm
length
the
cabinet
photo
of
herself
in
a
the
photo
or
one
like
it
that
she
had
the
folly
to
give
him
at
dundargue
but
to
her
horror
and
dismay
she
saw
that
it
had
been
reproduced
reversed
and
manipulated
in
some
way
by
some
low
photographer
and
combined
with
one
of
holcroft
himself
posed
as
if
in
the
act
of
embracing
her
forming
a
strange
group
of
two
whose
likenesses
there
would
be
no
mistaking
more
especially
that
of
her
as
it
was
a
miraculous
work
of
art
in
its
truth
and
individuality
it
was
olive
to
the
life
with
her
brightest
and
sweetest
expression
now
bent
on
his
face
am
glad
you
recognise
us
said
he
mockingly
as
he
replaced
the
photo
in
its
receptacle
and
the
latter
in
his
breast
pocket
now
to
business
what
would
your
hero
think
of
this
if
he
saw
it
ha
ha
he
did
not
approve
of
byron
at
dundargue
i
remember
would
rather
we
stuck
to
watts
hymns
i
suppose
doth
the
little
busy
bee
and
so
forth
well
like
that
industrious
insect
i
mean
to
improve
the
shining
hour
how
would
he
how
will
you
and
your
family
with
all
their
cursed
scotch
pride
like
to
see
this
photo
in
every
shop
window
exposed
for
sale
to
the
british
public
among
in
snowstorms
countesses
swinging
in
hammocks
bishops
and
generals
murderers
too
perhaps
eh
in
a
week
or
two
i
may
have
a
million
copies
of
this
precious
photo
for
sale
in
london
and
elsewhere
do
you
realise
the
meaning
of
this
my
scornful
beauty
and
the
result
it
must
have
on
you
your
name
your
character
your
family
and
your
future
miss
olive
raymond
posed
in
the
arms
of
hawke
holcroft
heavens
said
olive
in
a
low
voice
like
a
whisper
you
a
man
or
a
devil
little
of
both
perhaps
i
am
what
circumstances
have
made
me
wretch
oh
what
wrong
have
i
ever
done
you
that
you
should
cross
my
path
and
agonise
me
thus
holcroft
laughed
he
knew
that
she
had
a
more
than
handsome
allowance
at
her
guardian
behest
and
her
own
bank
account
he
was
without
remorse
or
pity
for
cowardice
and
selfishness
were
alike
the
ruling
features
of
his
character
and
he
thought
to
control
the
tongue
and
action
of
olive
through
her
own
pride
and
her
love
of
allan
with
an
eye
to
future
monetary
extortions
pressing
her
left
hand
upon
her
heart
as
if
she
felt
as
no
doubt
she
did
a
spasm
of
pain
there
and
with
her
eyes
almost
closed
she
said
the
name
of
mercy
give
me
back
that
photo
i
have
had
it
so
carefully
improved
as
a
work
of
art
no
no
miss
raymond
said
he
in
his
detestable
sneering
tone
i
shall
be
content
to
forego
my
interest
in
the
copyright
for
a
certain
reasonable
consideration
consideration
i
do
not
understand
you
sir
said
olive
faintly
and
clutching
a
table
for
support
then
i
mean
a
cheque
for
three
hundred
no
let
me
say
four
hundred
pounds
and
you
had
better
be
quick
about
it
as
i
have
no
time
to
spare
and
truth
to
tell
have
no
desire
to
renew
my
acquaintance
with
any
of
the
aberfeldie
folks
again
hundred
pounds
is
the
sum
miss
raymond
like
a
blind
person
she
feebly
and
irresolutely
seemed
to
grope
with
her
key
about
the
lock
of
her
davenport
and
holcroft
said
me
to
assist
you
he
unlocked
it
and
threw
open
the
lid
mechanically
she
seated
herself
and
began
to
write
while
conscious
that
this
bantering
villain
was
still
addressing
her
so
old
puddicombe
has
come
to
the
front
again
said
he
odd
marriage
it
will
be
his
with
miss
graham
brummagem
allying
itself
with
the
middle
ages
the
getting
a
line
in
burke
peerage
said
she
handing
him
the
cheque
which
he
received
with
a
low
mocking
bow
give
me
the
photo
with
pleasure
perhaps
you
may
wish
to
frame
it
now
listen
to
me
he
said
through
his
set
teeth
you
divulge
a
word
of
this
interview
or
make
known
the
power
i
have
over
you
by
means
of
this
photograph
then
and
in
that
case
as
i
believe
your
father
will
is
phrased
i
shall
at
once
introduce
it
to
the
british
public
i
give
you
this
copy
for
your
four
hundred
pounds
but
retain
the
negative
then
it
was
that
as
he
withdrew
a
cry
escaped
from
her
overcharged
breast
the
cry
overheard
by
allan
and
she
had
only
power
left
her
to
conceal
the
odious
photo
in
the
breast
of
her
dress
when
she
fell
fainting
on
the
floor
where
she
was
found
to
destroy
it
was
one
of
her
first
acts
when
consciousness
returned
and
she
was
alone
but
what
availed
the
destruction
of
this
one
when
her
tormentor
possessed
the
power
of
producing
others
without
limit
a
great
horror
possessed
her
now
a
dread
and
gloom
came
over
her
with
a
painful
nervous
terror
a
kind
of
hunted
emotion
a
fear
of
what
might
next
ensue
yet
she
took
no
one
into
her
confidence
not
even
allan
on
her
part
a
fatal
error
after
all
her
past
sweet
intercourse
with
him
their
delayed
marriage
delayed
by
the
illness
incident
to
holcroft
outrage
and
his
too
probable
speedy
departure
on
foreign
service
was
she
now
to
harrow
him
up
by
a
reference
to
her
folly
her
petulance
and
her
silly
degrading
flirtation
with
this
man
who
now
proved
such
a
pitiful
such
an
unfathomable
villain
what
if
allan
should
see
suddenly
that
fatal
photo
in
a
shop
window
this
possibility
plainly
stared
her
in
the
face
yet
she
was
silent
and
believed
that
ere
this
issue
came
to
pass
she
was
doomed
to
be
tortured
and
victimised
by
holcroft
again
and
the
thought
the
fear
of
this
gave
her
a
kind
of
fever
of
the
spirit
which
made
her
quite
ill
and
bewildered
her
friends
money
had
evidently
been
given
by
her
to
holcroft
no
small
sum
too
and
for
what
purpose
remembering
his
threat
if
she
exposed
his
rascality
her
tongue
was
now
tied
by
a
most
unwise
terror
ill
and
harrassed
she
remained
much
in
her
room
and
avoided
society
allan
as
he
said
resentfully
failed
see
the
situation
and
in
a
gust
of
pique
and
anger
feeling
himself
somewhat
degraded
by
olive
bearing
resigned
his
extended
leave
and
joined
his
regiment
as
olive
said
resolved
to
in
edinburgh
castle
rather
than
have
an
explanation
rather
unreasonably
forgetting
that
she
had
steadily
refused
to
give
one
she
felt
painfully
that
the
mystery
of
the
money
given
to
holcroft
was
calculated
to
compromise
her
with
her
kindred
but
what
was
that
when
compared
with
the
awful
thundercloud
which
hung
over
her
if
he
made
the
public
use
he
threatened
of
the
photo
her
soul
died
within
her
meanwhile
allan
struggled
hard
to
make
himself
believe
that
he
might
yet
be
happy
with
olive
that
he
had
perhaps
no
solid
reason
for
being
otherwise
but
it
would
not
do
it
what
does
all
this
new
mystery
mean
he
would
say
to
himself
seem
fated
to
misunderstand
each
other
somehow
after
all
she
seems
to
love
her
pride
more
than
me
still
and
olive
knew
that
it
was
mingled
pride
and
fear
that
had
opened
a
kind
of
chasm
between
her
and
allan
again
yet
a
little
sense
a
little
courage
and
candour
might
have
closed
it
speedily
enough
and
smoothed
away
the
anger
the
complication
raised
at
times
within
her
while
to
allan
the
situation
was
certainly
an
intolerable
one
and
olive
silence
or
reticence
made
it
all
the
more
so
chapter
xiii
wedded
while
baffled
in
her
attempts
to
bring
about
an
explanation
between
allan
and
olive
and
to
smooth
matters
over
with
that
wilful
young
lady
as
she
deemed
her
and
her
naturally
irritated
lady
aberfeldie
pushed
on
vigorously
all
the
arrangements
for
the
marriage
of
sir
paget
and
the
eveline
a
marriage
for
which
there
seemed
then
no
other
reason
than
an
avaricious
desire
of
grand
settlements
and
so
forth
all
olive
old
pride
and
petulance
with
much
of
irritation
that
was
new
seemed
to
have
come
back
to
her
and
until
the
matter
was
cleared
up
regarding
that
mysterious
visit
of
holcroft
to
maviswood
allan
had
ceased
to
speak
of
marriage
and
thus
her
spirit
took
fire
at
being
doubted
and
humbled
she
shrank
unwisely
from
a
simple
confession
that
might
have
obviated
all
this
and
from
revealing
the
shame
and
affront
to
which
this
man
possessed
the
power
of
exposing
her
detest
riddles
and
care
not
to
read
them
but
the
mask
she
is
wearing
if
a
mask
it
be
may
prove
a
costly
one
for
herself
and
us
all
thought
lord
aberfeldie
and
his
son
too
content
allan
to
know
that
i
gave
that
money
a
trifle
to
me
to
holcroft
in
the
hope
to
save
us
all
especially
myself
from
a
probable
public
affront
which
might
destroy
me
said
olive
on
one
occasion
her
eyes
flashing
through
her
tears
mystery
is
this
what
can
you
have
done
how
be
in
his
power
the
assertion
is
absurd
can
not
you
trust
me
she
asked
fondly
and
sadly
yet
proudly
know
not
what
to
think
but
the
whole
affair
looks
looks
to
me
devilish
queer
said
he
as
he
cut
the
matter
short
and
rode
away
on
which
olive
dried
her
tears
crested
up
her
head
and
looked
defiant
this
tiresome
couple
olive
and
allan
continue
to
pout
and
sulk
at
each
other
said
lady
aberfeldie
he
should
decline
to
marry
her
her
money
may
be
lost
to
us
by
her
birthday
the
lord
twisted
his
moustache
and
paused
what
gets
himself
killed
in
egypt
replied
lord
aberfeldie
grimly
heavens
do
not
say
such
a
thing
even
in
jest
and
now
perforce
of
their
present
situation
a
change
had
come
over
the
two
cousins
olive
and
eveline
they
never
read
studied
sung
rode
or
walked
together
as
they
had
been
wont
to
do
a
blight
had
come
over
both
their
lives
apparently
eveline
only
felt
a
little
at
ease
when
sir
paget
was
absent
from
her
and
even
then
she
was
pestered
by
his
which
like
those
written
usually
by
men
of
advanced
years
were
of
a
grotesquely
impassioned
nature
at
that
age
are
deeper
and
less
anxiety
not
to
compromise
oneself
is
shown
and
felt
says
an
essayist
fifty
men
are
often
wise
enough
to
vote
the
writing
of
a
bore
but
some
carry
on
the
practice
to
a
very
advanced
age
their
protestations
are
then
ingeniously
flavoured
with
touches
of
the
paternal
which
sometimes
entirely
mislead
the
unsophisticated
recipients
but
the
mere
sight
of
sir
paget
caligraphy
and
of
his
heraldic
having
a
shield
with
some
mysterious
design
thereon
and
the
motto
petit
alta
puddicombe
seeks
lofty
objects
proved
always
enough
for
eveline
who
tossed
it
into
the
basket
unread
but
torn
into
minute
fragments
while
a
sigh
of
weariness
and
repugnance
escaped
her
evan
cameron
loved
allan
graham
dearly
as
a
friend
and
had
naturally
a
desire
to
be
on
the
best
terms
with
him
as
the
brother
of
the
girl
to
whom
he
had
given
all
his
heart
thus
while
meeting
him
daily
on
parade
and
at
mess
he
was
sorely
puzzled
to
account
for
the
change
he
felt
in
allan
manner
to
himself
as
he
knew
not
that
the
latter
resented
the
cameron
episode
as
an
insult
to
eveline
his
sister
presume
you
know
that
my
sister
is
on
the
point
of
marriage
indeed
that
the
day
is
fixed
said
allan
rather
grimly
to
him
one
day
as
he
recalled
the
circumstance
of
how
evan
greatly
admired
to
say
the
least
of
it
eveline
and
how
her
heart
had
responded
thereto
cameron
made
no
reply
but
a
sudden
pallor
overspread
his
handsome
bronzed
face
and
all
his
studied
calmness
forsook
him
while
the
memory
of
past
hopes
and
joys
shook
his
heart
as
if
with
a
tempest
of
remembrance
but
stooping
and
half
turning
away
to
conceal
the
expression
of
his
face
he
attempted
to
light
a
cigar
a
sly
fellow
a
cunning
dog
you
are
said
allan
with
irritation
of
tone
what
way
do
you
mean
allan
asked
cameron
how
dare
you
ask
after
your
open
admiration
of
my
sister
miss
graham
in
a
man
in
your
position
cameron
mistook
his
meaning
but
the
mistake
failed
to
rouse
any
pride
as
his
heart
was
too
crushed
and
sore
just
then
he
exclaimed
as
tears
almost
welled
up
in
his
honest
eyes
loved
her
i
love
her
still
god
alone
knows
how
well
how
desperately
and
how
hopelessly
indeed
responded
allan
his
cheek
now
aflame
with
anger
you
dare
to
tell
me
this
after
all
that
we
know
of
yourself
and
mrs
cameron
it
was
now
cameron
turn
to
look
indignant
and
astonished
but
in
a
few
words
he
explained
all
evan
said
allan
as
he
wrung
the
hand
of
cameron
whose
head
sank
forward
so
much
was
he
overcome
by
emotion
am
glad
of
this
explanation
but
it
comes
too
late
if
indeed
it
could
ever
have
served
any
purpose
so
far
as
your
hopes
with
eveline
are
concerned
in
three
days
she
is
to
be
married
and
now
let
us
talk
of
the
subject
no
more
but
for
a
time
black
fury
gathered
in
the
heart
of
cameron
at
sir
paget
puddicombe
whose
deductions
however
from
all
that
he
saw
at
the
railway
station
were
most
natural
three
days
he
muttered
again
and
again
three
days
and
she
will
be
lost
to
me
for
ever
eveline
as
yet
was
ignorant
of
her
lover
purity
and
innocence
nor
would
the
knowledge
of
it
have
availed
her
much
there
was
a
meek
abandonment
of
her
own
will
of
her
own
judgment
and
lady
aberfeldie
caressed
her
more
than
she
had
ever
done
before
glad
to
find
that
she
had
become
my
lady
cared
not
why
or
how
compliant
at
last
she
seemed
quite
passive
and
supine
resigned
olive
phrased
it
and
ready
to
do
her
mother
bidding
for
evan
cameron
seemed
to
have
quite
passed
out
of
her
life
though
the
name
he
had
uttered
seemed
to
be
ever
in
her
ears
she
heard
her
mother
speaking
and
felt
her
caresses
but
her
eyes
were
suffused
by
a
kind
of
mist
yet
more
than
once
she
had
started
amid
her
apathy
and
thought
am
i
still
here
why
do
i
run
away
to
where
they
will
never
find
me
but
she
had
no
determining
motive
to
decide
her
choice
of
place
or
scheme
of
life
though
she
felt
that
ere
long
when
these
last
three
days
were
past
she
would
have
to
reconstruct
her
entire
future
and
from
that
future
her
heart
recoiled
and
shrank
her
temples
throbbed
as
she
thought
of
this
her
heart
seemed
alternately
to
thunder
in
her
breast
and
then
to
become
unnaturally
still
again
and
again
her
mother
told
her
that
she
would
be
surrounded
by
such
wealth
as
falls
to
the
lot
of
few
but
she
cared
not
for
wealth
nor
would
it
ever
remove
her
gloomy
and
bitter
reflections
and
at
the
very
name
of
her
intended
husband
though
she
evinced
no
emotion
a
secret
and
involuntary
shudder
came
over
her
society
was
intolerable
just
then
and
she
had
much
of
it
at
maviswood
how
intolerable
seemed
amid
the
bright
sunshine
the
soft
thud
of
the
balls
upon
the
racquets
as
they
were
shot
over
the
nettings
from
court
to
court
the
laughter
of
young
and
sweet
voices
and
the
cries
ever
and
anon
of
and
so
on
as
the
jovial
game
progressed
and
with
evening
came
the
inevitable
and
at
night
the
dance
allan
fearing
to
lacerate
his
sister
heart
knew
not
how
to
undeceive
her
in
the
matter
of
cameron
supposed
duplicity
though
the
truth
or
falsehood
thereof
could
not
affect
her
fate
or
her
relations
with
sir
paget
now
but
the
true
story
escaped
carslogie
quite
casually
when
in
conversation
with
olive
who
in
due
time
related
it
to
eveline
in
whose
breast
it
created
some
very
mingled
emotions
so
evan
was
innocent
while
she
had
been
feeling
in
her
heart
all
the
passion
and
pain
yea
a
sentiment
of
vengeance
which
women
will
feel
when
they
believe
they
have
been
loving
unworthily
early
on
her
marriage
morning
she
left
her
bed
to
think
over
all
this
wrapped
in
a
or
with
all
her
undressed
hair
floating
about
her
shoulders
and
blown
back
by
the
warm
summer
breeze
she
sat
at
the
open
window
of
her
room
and
looked
dreamily
out
with
sad
sad
eyes
on
the
sunny
landscape
and
the
lovely
hills
all
steeped
in
golden
haze
how
changed
seemed
its
beauty
now
and
how
she
longed
to
be
away
from
it
to
be
dead
in
fact
yet
she
was
at
an
age
when
even
to
live
ought
to
be
in
itself
a
joy
the
fragrance
of
the
dewy
summer
morning
seemed
to
fill
the
outer
world
and
amid
the
intense
stillness
she
heard
only
the
voices
of
a
lark
high
in
the
air
and
of
a
cushat
dove
in
the
coppice
her
marriage
morning
what
a
morning
of
woe
to
her
her
cheeks
were
pale
very
very
pale
but
with
her
parted
scarlet
lips
and
her
tangled
waves
of
rich
brown
hair
she
was
beautiful
as
ever
the
knowledge
that
her
lover
had
not
deceived
her
but
was
true
roused
her
for
a
time
and
filled
her
soul
with
a
tempest
of
unexpected
sorrow
compunction
and
joy
sorrow
that
she
had
wronged
him
compunction
for
the
cruel
mode
in
which
she
had
treated
him
and
joy
that
his
honour
was
unstained
and
that
he
still
was
true
but
oh
what
must
he
think
of
her
burying
her
face
in
her
tremulous
white
hands
she
wept
like
a
child
as
we
are
told
women
weep
when
their
hearts
break
over
the
grave
of
a
dead
love
and
threw
herself
across
her
bed
forgive
me
god
forgive
me
and
bless
and
comfort
you
my
love
she
murmured
evan
i
have
wronged
you
wronged
you
but
what
does
it
avail

after
all
after
all
and
she
lay
there
crouched
and
gathered
in
a
heap
as
it
were
till
olive
and
others
who
were
to
be
her
bridesmaids
roused
her
and
lifted
her
up
and
summoned
clairette
so
her
had
come
and
unless
she
fell
ill
or
died
the
ceremony
was
to
go
inexorably
on
olive
was
far
from
well
every
day
she
expected
to
hear
of
photo
being
seen
her
sole
protection
against
that
catastrophe
as
yet
was
the
fear
that
ere
it
came
to
pass
he
would
seek
her
presence
at
least
once
again
on
an
errand
of
extortion
but
ill
or
well
she
had
to
bear
her
part
in
the
ceremony
as
a
bridesmaid
and
a
charming
one
she
looked
allan
of
course
was
there
too
but
not
as
groomsman
a
friend

in
that
capacity
and
more
than
once
did
the
head
of
the
latter
jerk
about
in
a
way
that
was
quite
alarming
as
he
entered
the
church
which
was
for
the
occasion
to
the
tortured
mind
of
his
bride
she
thought
it
would
be
a
relief
when
the
ceremony
was
over
and
the
phantasmagoria
that
seemed
to
surround
her
had
all
passed

with

quite
jubilant
with
reviving
hopes
of

cold
and
now
white
lips
murmured
almost
inaudibly
the
words
she
was
bidden
to
say
the
few
but
terrible
words
that
made
her
a
wedded
wife
while
her
pallid
face
was
but
half
seen
amid
the
bridal
veil
that
seemed
to
float
like
filmy
mist
around
her
allan
alone
who
knew
the
real
secret
of
her
heart
looked
pityingly
darkly
and
gravely
on
for
it
was
a
union
of
which
however
his
father
and
mother
desired
it
he
did
not
approve
for
a
time
eveline
had
actually
schooled
herself
to
think
that
marriage
would
give
her
a
species
of
vengeance
on
the
man
who
she
thought
had
wronged
and
oppressed
her
but
now
oh
heaven
she
loved
the
lost
one
more
than
ever
while
death
alone
could
unforge
the
fetters
her
lips
were
riveting
was
it
ominous
of
evil
that
the
ring
dropped
from
her
wedding
finger
as
sir
paget
placed
it
there
at
last
all
was
over
the
great
organ
pealed
forth
the
the
bells
rang
joyously
in
the
great
spire
overhead
and
she
was
led
forth
by
sir
paget
leaning
on
his
arm
a
wedded
wife
so
time
would
pass
on
days
dawn
and

close
the

would
shine

on
the
quiet
pastoral
hills
on
the
great
castellated
mass
of
dundargue
the
woods
and
waters
of
her
old
home
but
never
would
she
be
as
she
had
been
as
a
happy
thoughtless
girl
the
eveline
graham
of
the
past
years
never
more
could
joy
be
hers
or
would
she
know
again
the
love
she
had
lost
the
tenderness
she
had
tasted
and
times
there
were
when
amid
her
general
passive
appearance
of
numbness
and
indifference
hot
scorching
tears
of
utter
despair
escaped
her
and
a
passionate
longing
seized
her
to
take
to
flight
whither
she
knew
not
and
to
rend
asunder
the
meshes
of
the
marriage
net
that
bound
her
now
and
in
this
frame
of
mind
she
departed
on
her
honeymoon
on
that
morning
there
lingered
long
on
one
of
the
western
batteries
of
the
old
castle
an
officer
who
if
he
was
noticed
at
all
seemed
to
be
solely
intent
on
enjoying
a
cigar
and
who
seemed
to
avoid
the
society
of
all
this
was
poor
evan
cameron
listening
to
the
wedding
bells
in
the
distant
spire
and
well
he
knew
for
what
a
tragedy
they
were
ringing
and
each
time
their
clangour
came
upon
the
wind
they
seemed
to
find
an
echo
in
his
heart
so
she
was
married
at
last
and
more
than
ever
lost
to
him
cards
came
to
him
in
due
course
and
he
tore
them
into
minute
fragments
evan
did
all
his
regimental
duties
and
daily
work
like
a
man
but
as
one
in
a
dream
all
that
was
required
of
him
with
more
than
ever
if
possible
strict
punctilio
yet
he
felt
himself
a
mere
machine
without
heart
or
soul
and
had
only
one
longing
for
the
time
when
he
might
turn
his
back
upon
his
native
country
and
find
himself
face
to
face
with
the
enemy
no
matter
who
or
where
that
enemy
might
be
chapter
xiv
mistrust
that
dear
eveline
is
off
our
hands
said
lady
aberfeldie
can
not
help
thinking
seriously
of
allan
affairs
and
those
of
olive
and
really
some
serious
advice
should
be
given
to
the
foolish
couple
could
not
you
interrupted
her
husband
wash
my
hands
of
lovers
and
their
piques
and
plans
you
have
managed
the
matter
of
eveline
and
sir
paget
try
your
skill
once
more
allan
nor
olive
is
so
compliant
as
poor
eveline
poor
eveline
indeed
think
of
her
marriage
thus
now
there
is
no
denying
it
is
rather
a
style
of
thing
but
let
us
not
speak
of
it
considering
that
her
husband
had
from
the
first
given
his
full
assent
to
the
whole
transaction
lady
aberfeldie
could
not
help
glancing
at
him
rather
reproachfully
but
she
only
said
has
of
course
many
admirers
but
the
rumour
of
her
engagement
to
allan
keeps
them
all
at
a
distance
olive
her
fortune
is
almost
a
misfortune
to
her
imagines
it
to
be
the
attraction
of
everyone
rather
than
her
own
beauty
once
she
conceived
it
to
be
the
attraction
of
allan
but
she
knows
better
now
that
he
loves
or
loved
her
for
herself
alone
has
already
had
two
peers
and
a
baronet
in
her
train
all
drawn
thither
i
fear
by
her
alone
and
young
carslogie
of
ours
seemed
desperately
smitten
too
i
always
think
of
the
black
watch
as
it
is
force
of
habit
a
fellow
with
plenty
of
money
is
his
equal
in
all
these
and
more
but
what
he
and
she
mean
by
dallying
and
delaying
as
they
do
i
can
not
conceive
allan
had
looked
upon
olive
at
the
recent
marriage
in
her
striking
costume
as
a
bridesmaid
and
thought
she
had
never
appeared
to
greater
advantage
why
should
she
not
have
figured
there
as
a
bride
too
what
was
the
secret
spring
of
this
doubt
and
mistrust
that
had
come
between
them
again
and
which
she
shrank
from
attempting
to
explain
to
do
her
justice
she
was
often
on
the
point
of
doing
so
but
a
sentiment
of
miserable
fear
of
what
allan
might
do
think
or
say
if
made
aware
of
the
deep
affront
holcroft
was
capable
of
inflicting
upon
his
future
wife
tied
her
tongue
better
would
it
have
been
a
thousand
times
had
she
trusted
to
allan
fully
and
implicitly
and
to
the
means
he
might
put
in
force
to
procure
or
purchase
the
silence
for
ever
of
such
a
reptile
as
her
tormentor
the
knowledge
in
the
minds
of
both
that
a
time
for
separation
must
inevitably
come
soon
now
if
all
the
rumours
of
war
proved
true
softened
their
emotions
and
drew
the
cousins
towards
each
other
again
the
intercourse
between
them
had
as
of
old
its
usual
charm
but
was
strange
and
constrained
for
as
allan
did
not
attempt
again
the
of
lover
but
seemed
to
his
time
olive
felt
her
pride
alarmed
and
would
often
reply
to
him
coldly
with
a
straightening
of
her
slim
form
and
a
cresting
up
of
her
graceful
neck
and
handsome
head
time
passed
on
she
heard
nothing
of
hawke
holcroft
or
his
threats
and
the
courage
of
olive
rose
but
it
was
awful
to
think
of
her
name
being
at
the
mercy
of
such
a
creature
even
if
she
were
married
once
the
love
that
was
really
smouldering
in
the
hearts
of
both
nearly
burst
into
a
flame
again
olive
was
seated
in
the
garden
at
maviswood
so
deeply
lost
in
thought
that
she
was
unaware
of
allan
approach
until
he
overhung
the
rustic
sofa
she
occupied
penny
for
your
thoughts
olive
said
he
sum
usually
offered
for
what
might
prove
a
perilous
secret
to
know
thoughts
were
of
many
things
till
your
voice
scattered
them
said
she
twirling
her
sunshade
on
her
shoulder
was
in
hope
they
were
of
me
olive
only
smiled
and
remained
silent
while
he
looked
into
her
eyes
with
a
curiously
mingled
expression
which
seemed
to
be
both
imploring
and
commanding
but
she
only
said
were
not
of
you
why
should
they
be
allan
drew
back
a
pace
with
a
cloudy
brow
my
being
playful
for
a
moment
olive
i
shall
never
in
this
way
offend
you
again
she
gave
him
a
sweet
and
deprecating
almost
an
entreating
glance
but
allan
did
not
perceive
it
his
face
was
turned
angrily
and
sadly
from
her
so
her
pique
ever
so
ready
became
roused
said
allan
after
a
pause
should
always
be
stronger
than
pride
course
when
love
exists
she
replied
turning
a
shoulder
from
him
with
you
olive
do
not
let
it
stand
between
us
as
before
if
your
father
will
is
again
the
cause
let
me
tell
you
once
more
that
i
refuse
to
have
any
share
in
that
lunatic
arrangement
and
will
not
marry
you
on
any
such
conditions
is
thinking
or
talking
of
marriage
said
she
sarcastically
yet
making
an
effort
to
restrain
her
tears
i
fear
that
as
a
husband
you
would
be
very
tyrannical
and
cruel
character
in
the
present
and
the
past
does
not
bear
out
this
i
think
then
without
extreme
and
just
reason
replied
allan
as
his
mind
flashed
back
to
the
holcroft
episode
she
strove
to
glance
at
him
defiantly
but
failing
smiled
though
his
handsome
face
had
in
it
an
expression
of
sorrow
and
anger
a
month
be
past
olive
an

bullet
may
make
you
every
way
a
free
woman
so
far
as
regards
your
father
will
do
not
wish
to
be
free
from
it
she
was
on
the
point
of
saying
passionately
but
controlled
her
speech
and
remained
unwisely
silent
allan
regarded
her
wistfully
injudicious
reticence
and
a
little
aversion
the
best
beginning
of
a
true
love
he
asked
i
am
no
casuist
said
she
tapping
the
ground
with
a
pretty
little
foot
impatiently
lovely
pouting
and
wistful
her
face
was
now
turned
to
his
with
a
mixture
of
petulance
and
shy
reproach
as
she
thought
why
does
he
not
take
me
in
his
arms
and
kiss
and
make
a
fuss
with
me
as
he
used
to
do
but
repelled
by
her
curious
manner
allan
had
no
intention
of
doing
any
such
thing
and
thought
her
a
curious
enigma
so
thus
the
chance
of
a
complete
reunion
ended
and
ere
long
the
luckless
olive
was
to
have
cause
for
repenting
most
bitterly
her
lack
of
candour
and
perfect
trust
and
the
force
of
the
overweening
pride
which
engendered
mistrust
in
one
who
loved
her
so
well

to
none
in
peace
and
war
and
its
very
name
and
number
are
rendered
dear
to
the
people
of
scotland
by
innumerable
ties
of
friendship
and
clanship
by
traditions
and
glorious
exploits
in
battle
in
almost
everything
that
has
added
strength
or
brilliance
to
the
british
empire
the
regiment
has
borne
a
leading
part
and
to
attempt
to
trace
its
annals
would
be
to
write
the
history
of
our
wars
since
the
days
of
the
second
george
suffice
it
that
the
second
year
after
the
companies
were
constituted
a
regiment
saw
them
fighting
for
the
house
of
austria
against
france
and
bavaria
and
covering
the
rear
of
that
british
army
which
was
hurled
from
the
heights
of
fontenoy
by
the
bayonets
of
the
irish
brigades
and
where
we
are
told
gallantry
of
sir
robert
munroe
of
gallantry
of
sir
robert
munroe
of
culcairn
and
his
highlanders
was
the
theme
of
admiration
through
all
britain
so
it
was
with
them
in
the
old
flanders
war
till
saw
them
attacking
ticonderoga
in
america
where
rushing
from
amid
the
reserve
where
they
disdained
to
linger
they
hewed
down
the
dense
abatis
with
their
claymores
and
storming
the
breastworks
up
one
another
shoulders
and
placing
their
feet
in
the
holes
made
in
the
face
of
the
works
by
their
swords
and
bayonets
no
ladders
having
been
provided
exposed
the
while
to
a
dreadful
fire
of
cannon
and
musketry
under
which
six
hundred
and
of
them
fell
and
hence
a
cry
for
vengeance
went
through
the
country
of
the
clans
procuring
so
many
recruits
and
another
battalion
was
formed
and
fresh
glories
were
won
in
the
west
india
isles
where
at
martinique
and
by
the
walls
of
the
moro
their
pipes
sent
up
the
notes
of
victory
in
the
fatal
strife
of
the
american
revolt
they
were
ever
in
the
van
and
the
first
years
of
the
present
century
saw
their
tartans
waving
darkly
amid
the
of
aboukir
under
the
shadow
of
pillar
and
on
the
plains
of
alexandria
where
they
cut
to
pieces
the
french
invincibles
slew
six
hundred
and
fifty
of
them
captured
their
colours
which
were
delivered
to
major
stirling
together
with
the
cannon
they
had
also
seized
and
ere
long
the
mosques
and
towers
of
grand
cairo
echoed
to
their
martial
music
who
can
record
the
brilliance
of
their
valour
in
the
long
and
glorious
war
of
the
peninsula
that
war
of
victories
which
began
on
the
banks
of
the
douro
and
continued
to
the
hill
of
toulouse
and
anon
their
prowess
on
the
plains
of
waterloo
when
under
macara
they
formed
the
flower
of
picton
superb
division
and
where
with
the
greys
and
gordon
highlanders
they
sent
up
the
cry
which
still
finds
echo
in
every
scottish
heart
the
of
for
ever
while
plunging
into
those
mighty
french
columns
which
rolled
away
before
their
bayonets
like
smoke
before
the
wind
there
their
total
casualties
were
two
hundred
and
of
all
ranks
fought
like
heroes
and
like
heroes
fell
an
honour
to
the
country
to
quote
the
war
office
record
page
many
a
highland
hill
and
through
many
a
lowland
valley
long
will
the
deeds
of
these
brave
men
be
fondly
remembered
and
their
fate
deeply
deplored
never
did
a
finer
body
of
men
take
the
field
never
did
men
march
to
battle
that
were
destined
to
perform
such
services
to
their
country
and
to
obtain
such
immortal
renown
but
equal
renown
did
their
services
win
on
the
banks
of
the
alma
when
old
colin
campbell
led
them
into
action
exclaiming
men
the
whole
army
is
watching
us
make
me
proud
of
my
highland
brigade
and
reason
indeed
had
that
grand
old
soldier
to
be
proud
of
his
lads
in
the
kilt
as
they
swept
up
the
green
hillsides
to
glory
ground
they
had
to
ascend
says
an
the
author
of
a
good
deal
more
steep
and
broken
than
the
slope
beneath
the
redoubt
in
the
land
where
those
scots
were
bred
there
are
shadows
of
sailing
clouds
shimmering
up
the
mountain
side
and
their
paths
are
rugged
and
steep
yet
their
course
is
smooth
easy
and
swift
smoothly
easily
and
swiftly
the
black
watch
seemed
to
glide
up
the
hill
a
few
minutes
before
their
tartans
ranged
dark
in
the
valley
now
their
plumes
were
on
the
crest
into
the
dense
grey
masses
of
the
kazan
column
over
which
towered
the
miraculous
figure
of
sergius
their
steady
volley
swept
like
a
sheet
of
lead
anon
their
line
of
bayonets
was
flashing
to
the
charge
like
a
hedge
of
steel
and
a
wail
of
despair
broke
from
the
muscovites
who
crying
that
angel
of
death
had
come
threw
away
all
that
might
impede
their
speed
and
fled
says
the
brilliant
author
we
have
quoted
the
cheers
of
the
highland
brigade
along
the
kourgané
slopes
and
thence
west
almost
home
to
the
causeway
the
hillsides
were
made
to
resound
with
that
joyous
and
assuring
cry
which
is
the
natural
utterance
of
a
northern
people
so
long
as
it
is
warlike
and
free
their
furious
onset
struck
terror
to
many
an
indian
heart
during
the
dark
years
of
the
sepoy
revolt
and
like
sweetest
music
their
pipes
were
heard
by
that
desperate
and
despairing
band
who
fought
for
their
wives
and
children
in
beleaguered
lucknow
and
as
of
course
the
old
black
watch
must
be
in
everything
they
bore
their
share
in
the
conquest
of
coomassie
and
were
the
first
men
in
the
sable
city
as
their
pipes
announced
to
the
army
of
wolseley
while
on
this
subject
we
can
not
help
quoting
a
frenchman
estimate
of
the
scottish
troops
in
the
de
for
a
writer
says
scottish
soldiers
form
without
distinction
the
cream
of
the
british
army
and
the
highlander
is
the
prototype
of
the
excellent
soldier
he
has
all
the
requisite
qualities
without
one
defect
unluckily
for
great
britain
the
population
of
scotland
is
not
numerous
saving
it
is
true
to
the
point
of
putting
by
penny
after
penny
the
scotsman
for
all
that
is
honest
steadfast
and
amiable
in
his
intercourse
with
others
enthusiastic
and
proud
most
chivalrous
when
the
question
is
about
shedding
his
blood
the
old
traditions
of
clanship
subsist
each
company
is
grouped
round
an
illustrious
name
and
all
and
every
man
is
sure
to
be
the
cousin
the
highlanders
have
a
strange
sort
of
bravery
which
partakes
of
french
fire
and
english
phlegm
they
rush
with
impetuosity
they
charge
with
vigour
but
are
not
hurried
away
by
anger
in
the
very
hottest
of
an
attack
a
simple
order
suffices
to
stop
them
formed
in
square
you
would
take
them
for
englishmen
but
in
the
bayonet
charge
you
would
swear
they
were
french
for
the
rest
they
are
of
celtic
origin
and
the
blood
of
our
fathers
flows
in
their
veins
in
the
eyes
of
the
turk
the
scots
have
one
enormous
fault
that
of
showing
their
bare
legs
in
eyes
they
have
but
one
defect
but
still
excessively
annoying
their
depraved
taste
for
the
screaming
of
the
bagpipes
we
know
that
the
highlanders
would
not
get
under
fire
with
without
being
excited
by
their
national
airs
being
played
on
this
discordant
instrument
one
of
their
generals
having
put
down
this
piercing
music
they
attacked
the
enemy
so
languidly
that
the
bagpipes
had
to
be
restored
to
them
and
then
they
took
the
position
in
a
word
we
repeat
that
the
scots
are
magnificent
soldiers
we
may
smile
at
the
frenchman
idea
of
the
pipes
for
as
the
old
piper
said
of
count
flauhault
when
he
expressed
his
disgust
thereat
she
heard
owre
muckle
o
them
at
waterloo
and
now
once
again
the
black
watch
were
going
to
the
land
of
the
sun
and
the
desert
where
abercrombie
received
his
while
calling
to
them
in
the
charge
brave
highlanders
remember
your
country
remember
your
forefathers
and
these
glories
with
all
stirring
memories
of
a
thousand
years
were
not
forgotten
on
that
day
in
the
august
of
when
under
the
scion
of
a
gallant
house
cluny
the
younger
the
regiment
received
its
orders
of
readiness
and
began
to
prepare
for
its
departure
from
the
castle
of
edinburgh
while
a
mighty
throb
seemed
to
pervade
the
heart
of
the
city
as
its
hour
of
departure
approached
all
in
its
ranks
of
course
had
friends
whom
they
sorrowed
to
leave
all
save
poor
evan
cameron
and
all
were
impatient
and
full
of
ardour
to
join
in
the
coming
strife
but
none
perhaps
were
more
impatient
than
he
for
he
had
to
seek
forgetfulness
oblivion
from
his
own
thoughts
a
refuge
from
his
futile
regrets
among
other
scenes
for
the
lost
love
of
one
who
could
never
be
more
to
him
than
a
tender
memory
now
chapter
xvi
in
the
belvidere
shakespeare
tells
us
that
men
have
died
and
worms
have
eaten
them
but
not
for
love
so
evan
cameron
did
not
die
nor
had
he
any
thoughts
of
dying
but
it
seemed
to
his
young
and
enthusiastic
heart
just
then
that
all
which
made
life
worth
living
for
and
all
its
fulness
splendour
and
joy
were
over
and
done
with
for
him
of
the
movements
of
the
aberfeldie
family
he
knew
nothing
at
that
time
allan
was
again
on
leave
and
was
to
join
the
regiment
on
the
day
of
its
embarkation
in
england
evan
had
a
longing
to
see
the
place
where
he
had
last
seen
eveline
as
her
lover
at
maviswood
memories
of
the
past
days
at
dundargue
came
vividly
upon
him
now
of
the
times
when
they
had
wandered
in
the
leafy
woods
near
the
old
castle
talking
sweet
nonsense
with
happy
hearts
and
laughter
that
came
so
readily
when
eye
spoke
to
eye
and
hand
thrilled
when
it
touched
hand
with
lingering
pressure
and
glances
were
exchanged
that
if
they
meant
anything
meant
love
lord
aberfeldie
had
been
ever
kind
to
him
and
a
friend
of
his
father
he
thought
he
would
like
to
press
the
good
peer
hand
once
more
before
he
departed
for
the
regiment
was
going
far
away
to
a
land
from
whence
he
might
never
return
so
as
evan
was
an
impulsive
young
fellow
he
repaired
at
once
to
maviswood
he
found
tappleton
the
old
family
butler
airing
his
figure
at
the
front
door
when
he
approached
lord
aberfeldie
he
was
informed
was
in
london
his
lordship
was
residing
with
miss
raymond
at
southsea
and
sir
paget
was
not
at
home
paget
is
he
living
here
asked
cameron
with
a
start
sir
for
a
few
days
lady
lady
he
paused
unable
to
pronounce
the
name
also
here
replied
tappleton
knowing
instantly
who
he
meant
she
is
out
somewhere
walking
in
the
grounds
evan
gave
the
butler
a
couple
of
cards
and
turned
away
he
felt
quite
startled
to
find
that
sir
paget
and
his
bride
were
resident
at
maviswood
and
thought
that
he
could
not
get
away
from
the
vicinity
of
the
house
too
soon
proceeding
down
the
avenue
he
passed
a
narrow
diverging
path
between
high
old
the
vista
of
which
was
closed
by
a
belvidere
or
species
of
pillared
alcove
built
upon
a
grassy
knoll
and
therein
as
if
in
a
shrine
stood
eveline
to
pass
was
impossible
for
a
moment
he
stood
rooted
to
the
spot
and
then
as
one
in
a
dream
approached
her
to
meet
her
face
to
face
thus
was
like
something
of
a
dreadful
shock
to
both
now
eveline
was
deadly
pale
and
trembling
while
her
graceful
figure
looked
very
slight
and
girlish
in
her
fresh
cambric
costume
and
gipsy
hat
at
the
very
moment
of
their
meeting
there
her
mind
had
been
full
of
him
how
had
poor
evan
borne
the
tidings
of
her
marriage
and
with
it
the
total
destruction
of
their
mutual
wishes
mutual
hopes
they
had
none
she
had
often
pondered
on
this
and
wondered
how
he
had
heard
it
who
had
told
him
of
it
or
if
he
had
seen
it
in
the
papers
and
how
he
looked
when
the
sad
tidings
came
of
the
cruel
mockery
of
sending
him
she
knew
nothing
was
he
striving
to
forget
er
perhaps
learning
to
hate
her
oh
not
that
to
despise
her
nor
that
if
he
knew
all
but
they
were
nothing
to
each
other
now
and
never
could
be
anything
more
anon
would
come
other
thoughts
that
were
perilous
to
a
young
and
enthusiastic
girl
evan
cameron
had
given
himself
to
her
with
all
his
heart
and
with
all
his
soul
and
he
loved
her
with
all
the
strength
of
both
and
now
now
with
another
man
upon
her
finger
she
felt
unprepared
to
relinquish
that
love
for
she
could
not
doubt
that
it
must
still
exist
though
he
had
been
cruelly
and
selfishly
treated
and
while
all
these
thoughts
had
been
coursing
through
her
brain
he
came
suddenly
before
her
pray
that
he
may
soon
forget
me
poor
evan
had
been
her
frequent
thought
should
he
think
of
me
more
when
he
knows
of
my
marriage
and
must
deem
me
a
pitiful
creature
each
caught
their
breath
each
clasped
their
hands
as
if
in
mute
misery
and
the
eyes
of
both
were
strained
as
if
the
pain
of
recognition
was
mingled
with
the
peril
of
the
situation
evan
thought
how
pale
and
transfigured
looked
the
soft
face
of
his
lost
love
knew
not
that
you
where
here
i
came
to
visit
your
father
we
march
tomorrow
and
and
evan
paused
breathlessly
though
his
voice
seemed
to
thrill
with
passion
and
his
lips
when
they
touched
her
hands
even
the
hand
with
the
obnoxious
trembled
and
quivered
like
those
of
a
girl
she
said
softly
darling
my
lost
darling
broke
from
his
lips
as
he
clasped
her
in
his
arms
and
her
slender
fingers
softly
and
tremulously
caressed
his
dark
and
hair
with
something
that
was
almost
motherly
or
sisterly
in
the
intensity
of
its
tenderness
evan
she
whispered
god
watch
over
you
spare
you
protect
you
and
give
you
some
other
heart
to
make
you
happy
it
was
some
solace
to
evan
wounded
spirit
that
she
had
been
in
a
manner
apart
from
her
temporary
doubt
of
himself
forced
into
her
marriage
that
her
own
free
will
poor
girl
had
no
hand
in
the
matter
clasped
to
his
heart
hers
was
beating
for
some
moments
the
wild
music
of
recovered
joy
her
great
dread
silenced
by
her
greater
passion
but
to
what
end
was
it
all
is
madness
exclaimed
evan
as
they
stood
for
a
minute
hand
clasped
in
hand
and
gazing
into
each
other
eyes
indeed
moaned
eveline
am
going
far
away
my
darling
and
shall
never
see
you
again
that
i
may
find
a
grave
in
egypt
is
the
kindest
wish
you
can
have
for
me
and
that
you
will
never
think
but
kindly
of
me
in
the
time
to
come
is
my
only
and
my
dearest
hope
now
she
was
in
his
arms
again
the
girl
every
tress
of
whose
hair
was
dear
to
him
every
expression
of
whose
eyes
and
lips
every
tone
of
whose
voice
every
charm
and
grace
of
whose
face
and
form
were
graven
on
his
inner
heart
but
what
availed
all
that
now
know
all
now
my
secret
and
that
i
was
not
false
to
you
eveline
said
he
she
replied
hollowly
alice
could
not
come
to
my
quarters
in
the
castle
consequently
i
had
to
meet
her
somewhere
where
you
saw
us
poor
little
soul
she
had
no
one
to
trust
to
to
confide
in
save
me
now
has
gone
back
to
her
husband
back
to
my
brother
in
india
with
the
idea
that
you
evan
had
deceived
me
i
was
blind
careless
passive
in
their
hands
and
heedless
what
became
of
me
and
sir
paget
bought
me
of
them
bought
me
of
papa
and
mamma
as
a
slave
who
loathes
her
buyers
and
her
slavery
exclaimed
eveline
wildly
a
fate
my
darling
a
fate
indeed
she
whispered
through
her
set
teeth
we
must
part
now
she
added
but
without
withdrawing
her
hands
from
his
firm
clasp
parting
bitter
as
death
eveline
as
hopeless
she
said
now
sobbing
heavily
with
all
its
bitterness
this
has
been
a
great
an
unexpected
joy
to
see
you
here
to
embrace
you
once
again
of
one
grim
fact
they
could
not
be
oblivious
she
was
another
wife
and
he
had
to
tear
himself
away
to
lose
for
ever
the
sight
of
that
sweet
afflicted
face
the
tones
of
that
beloved
voice
to
long
again
for
both
with
eager
eyes
and
ears
in
the
time
that
was
to
come
parted
thus
eveline
you
will
think
of
me
sometimes
you
will
remember
ever
and
for
ever
while
my
miserable
life
lasts
evan
poor
darling
to
remember
me
to
be
constant
to
me
in
memory
while
another
wife
can
not
realise
that
even
now
still
less
what
my
life
will
be
in
the
future
with
you
not
in
it
a
long
clinging
kiss
and
he
was
gone
while
eveline
sank
down
on
the
stone
seat
within
the
belvidere
in
a
state
of
in
which
she
was
discovered
by
sir
paget
chapter
xvii
the
route
few
scenes
are
more
stirring
than
the
departure
of
a
regiment
for
the
seat
of
war
in
scotland
perhaps
more
than
anywhere
else
when
it
is
the
departure
of
a
national
regiment
endeared
to
the
people
by
historical
and
warlike
associations
combined
with
those
of
clanship
and
kindred
the
last
toast
at
the
mess
ere
it
was
broken
up
was
nam

glean

and
now
till
more
peaceful
times
its
magnificent
and
trophied
was
stored
away
among
it
that
gigantic
silver
tripod
with
its
fluted
bowl
weighing
eighteen
hundred
ounces
bearing
with
other
mottoes

about
seven
in
the
morning
the
pipers
of
the
black
watch
blew
the
gathering
waking
the
echoes
of
that
grand
old
fortress
which
is
the
focus
of
so
much
scottish
history
and
from
the
gates
of
which
by
sword
or
spear
the
tide
of
war
was
so
often
rolled
back
in
the
stormy
days
of
old
and
now
the
sound
of
the
pipes
found
a
deeper
echo
in
the
hearts
of
the
thousands
who
were
mustering
in
the
streets
below
to
bid
the
regiment
farewell
and
wish
it
in
the
land
it
was
going
to
the
august
morning
was
a
lovely
one
and
the
shadows
formed
by
the
golden
sunshine
lay
purple
and
deep
in
the
glens
of
the
pentlands
and
in
the
valleys
and
hollows
spanned
by
the
bridges
of
the
city
and
overlooked
by
the
towering
edifices
of
its
terraced
streets
amid
which
rose
every
spire
and
pinnacle
tipped
with
ruddy
splendour
the
woods
and
gardens
were
still
in
all
their
summer
beauty
and
greenery
and
the
in
the
distance
were
ripe
with
golden
grain
over
all
the
landscape
ere
that
corn
was
all
gathered
many
of
those
who
came
gaily
forth
mustering
to
the
sound
of
the
pipes
were
to
find
their
graves
in
the
sand
of
the
egyptian
desert
where
the
black
watch
had
gathered
so
many
laurels
in
the
wars
of
other
years
all
the
city
was
astir
as
it
had
never
been
since
the
king
own
left
the
same
fortress
for
the
shores
of
the
crimea
and
the
hum
of
the
gathering
thousands
filled
the
clear
air
of
the
dewy
morning
cluny
trusted
in
his
men
and
thus
on
this
conspicuous
morning
no
man
failed
him
and
no
man
was
absent
from
his
place
in
the
ranks
the
bustle
of
departure
was
past
stores
had
been
issued
the
grey
tropical
helmet
with
a
little
crimson
hackle
worn
on
the
left
side
was
for
a
time
to
supersede
the
graceful
bonnet
with
its
black
plumes
valises
and
haversacks
had
been
packed
rifles
and
bayonets
inspected
the
baggage
selected
and
forwarded
and
nothing
remained
now
but
to
march
after
sixteen
months
residence
in
the
city
of
the
stuarts
cluny
had
kindly
given
ample
opportunities
to
his
men
to
take
leave
of
their
friends
and
it
was
only
for
a
short
time
before
their
departure
that
the
great
palisaded
barriers
of
the
castle
were
closed
at
the
against
all
comers
and
the
human
surge
that
pressed
against
them
at
last
the
pipes
were
heard
echoing
under
that
deep
archway
through
which
millions
of
armed
men
have
marched
the
brass
drums
rang
under
the
grim
ports
of
the
battery
the
barriers
were
rolled
back
and
with
dragoons
clearing
the
way
the
black
watch
in
their
fighting
kits
with
grey
helmets
white
jackets
and
tartans
their
colours
cased
and
all
their
bayonets
glittering
in
the
sun
like
a
rippling
stream
of
steel
came
marching
down
the
slope
while
cheers
rent
the
air
cheers
and
shouts
though
doubtless
many
a
heavy
heart
was
there
for
wives
and
sweethearts
children
and
parents
alike
were
being
left
behind
by
those
on
whose
faces
they
might
never
look
again
each
man
had
on
his
back
a
valise
tin
canteen
and
his
haversack
and
were
slung
and
attached
to
a
lanyard
at
his
neck
each
carried
a
large
knife
like
the
genuine
jockteleg
of
the
days
of
old
and
right
and
they
all
looked
the
officers
who
were
in
blue
patrol
jackets
with
kilt
claymore
and
dirk
carried
knives
of
the
same
kind
together
with
a
haversack
and
dense
were
the
crowds
occupying
every
street
every
window
and
balcony
every
coign
of
vantage
and
the
whole
area
through
which
the
regiment
marched
to
the
sound
of
its
national
and
martial
music
seemed
instinct
with
life
ardour
and
enthusiasm
many
veterans
were
in
the
ranks
of
the
regiment
men
who
had
served
in
ashanti
and
not
a
few
who
as
albany
highlanders
had
marched
to
candahar
and
fought
in
afghanistan
their
colonel
cluny
the
younger
son
of
that
venerable
cluny
who
is
chief
of
the
macphersons
or
clanvurich
the
second
tribe
of
the
great
clan
chattan
and
was
once
a
black
watchman
rode
at
their
head
and
near
him
marched
his
favourite
macneil
a
tall
stately
and
tried
soldier
who
though
he
knew
not
the
fate
before
him
when
the
hour
came
had
no
fear
of
facing
death
as
became
one
of
the
freicudan
dhu
evan
cameron
as
he
marched
on
claymore
in
hand
had
a
shrewd
idea
that
among
the
many
there
whose
tender
hearts
were
filled
with
pity
and
enthusiasm
would
be
one
who
was
secretly
and
inexpressibly
dear
to
himself
and
yet
though
a
kind
of
mortal
pain
was
in
his
breast
his
heart
despite
it
all
beat
responsive
to
the
cadence
of
the
old
familiar
march
the
regimental
the
same
air
to
which
he
had
so
often
trod
in
past
times
and
in
other
lands
and
now
as
one
in
a
dream
he
saw
the
seething
crowds
the
forest
of
waving
hats
and
handkerchiefs
and
all
the
glorious
view
on
which
he
was
probably
looking
for
the
last
time
the
noble
line
of
princes
street
steeped
in
the
morning
sun
the
calton
hill
with
its
line
of
towers
and
battlements
its
temples
great
stone
obelisk
and
reproduction
of
the
classic
parthenon
of
minerva
arthur
seat
and
the
craigs
and
the
old
city
with
its
houses
each
a
stone
record
of
the
historic
past
he
was
suddenly
roused
on
seeing
carslogie
playfully
kiss
the
basket
hilt
of
his
claymore
and
wave
his
hand
to
a
young
lady
who
sat
by
the
side
of
an
elderly
gentleman
in
an
open
barouche
she
was
closely
veiled
but
evan
heart
leaped
in
his
breast
when
he
recognised
eveline
eveline
by
the
side
of
sir
paget
who
waved
his
hat
occasionally
and
jerked
his
bald
head
about
as
usual
was
such
a
girl
as
that
allan
graham
sister
sacrificed
to
that
old
devil
of
a
fogie
asked
one
of
the
black
watch
of
carslogie
a
young
fellow
who
thought
it
very
nice
to
be
in
the
but
very
nasty
to
be
also
in
debt
and
was
now
right
glad
to
find
himself
for
egypt
indeed
you
may
well
ask
he
replied
because
her
father
is
one
of
the
upper
ten
and
like
all
that
lot
selfish
to
the
backbone
and
cameron
heart
endorsed
his
answer
to
the
full
eveline
saw
him
and
for
a
moment
but
a
moment
only
raised
her
veil
the
tale
of
all
she
had
endured
was
written
in
the
wistful
and
mournful
expression
of
her
soft
hazel
eyes
and
all
who
knew
her
now
remarked
that
though
she
sometimes
smiled
she
never
laughed
she
felt
her
lips
quiver
and
the
lines
of
them
tighten
for
we
may
control
deep
emotion
in
the
eyes
but
on
the
mouth
never
her
whole
heart
and
soul
were
concentrated
in
the
effort
to
appear
calm
and
look
on
though
her
eyes
were
dim
with
the
tears
in
which
she
feared
just
then
to
indulge
my
darling
she
whispered
to
herself
again
and
again
but
voicelessly
in
her
heart
dear
love
my
brave
evan
i
shall
never
see
you
again
surreptitiously
she
concealed
her
handkerchief
in
her
pocket
and
drew
forth
another
a
fresh
one
redolent
of
quickly
though
she
did
it
sir
paget
saw
the
act
drew
his
own
conclusions
therefrom
and
thought
himself
an
ass
for
having
accorded
her
permission
to
see
the
black
watch
depart
their
recent
brief
meeting
the
memory
of
the
passionate
kisses
that
should
never
have
been
given
or
taken
added
now
to
the
supremeness
of
the
present
moment
he
only
appeared
to
bow
to
her
but
as
he
gazed
with
eyes
of
passionate
yearning
on
her
face
the
lips
he
had
kissed
so
often
the
eyes
that
had
so
often
looked
with
love
into
his
and
did
so
now
his
heart
filled
with
a
wild
and
desperate
longing
to
take
her
to
his
breast
and
cover
her
face
with
kisses
again
but
the
drums
beat
the
pipes
played
loud
and
high
the
crowds
cheered
and
the
forward
march
went
ruthlessly
on
all
this
fuss
of
eveline
thought
sir
paget
could
not
be
merely
for
the
departure
of
her
brother
regiment
at
last
to
eveline
ears
the
sound
of
pipe
and
drum
died
away
in
the
distance
as
the
barouche
was
driven
homeward
to
maviswood
but
now
the
despair
in
her
face
and
attitude
was
too
palpable
not
to
attract
the
attention
of
sir
paget
who
jerked
his
face
forward
quite
close
to
hers
and
regarded
her
gloomily
and
in
silence
in
all
that
followed
now
evan
cameron
seemed
to
act
mechanically
and
to
do
that
which
was
his
duty
by
mere
force
of
habit
as
the
regiment
marched
into
the
resounding
railway
station
where
he
saw
the
men
of
his
company
to
compartments
saw
the
sergeants
marking
on
the
footboard
of
the
carriages
with
chalk
the
letter
of
the
company
saw
the
men
take
off
their
valises
and
ere
long
the
swift
special
train
was
sweeping
through
the
dark
tunnel
that
pierces
the
rocky
bowels
of
calton
hill
and
the
black
watch
were
fairly
off
for
egypt
again
how
to
bear
his
loss
in
the
long
years
that
were
to
come
if
the
fortune
of
war
spared
him
was
the
thought
that
tortured
most
the
mind
of
cameron
then
and
gave
him
an
emotion
of
despair
he
remembered
the
fixed
and
agonised
gaze
of
eveline
he
remembered
too
the
manner
in
which
her
spouse
had
looked
grimly
on
with
an
angry
yet
not
unsatisfied
jerk
of
the
head
as
he
no
doubt
was
thinking
they
seen
the
last
of
evan
cameron
the
future
all
that
was
vague
to
the
latter
indeed
chapter
xviii
only
will
be
cozened
twice
it
was
on
an
august
evening
the
sun
had
not
set
but
the
sky
was
cloudy
and
gloomy
the
wind
was
high
and
a
heavy
sea
was
on
at
spithead
and
the
conservatory
in
which
olive
was
lingering
and
selecting
a
of
violets
and
fern
for
allan
was
so
dark
already
that
the
lamps
were
lighted
in
it
she
was
dressed
for
a
and
was
looking
charming
her
best
and
brightest
as
she
sang
softly
to
herself
and
wandered
from
one
shelf
of
potted
flowers
to
another
when
allan
suddenly
joined
her
with
an
expression
in
his
face
that
was
full
of
mingled
sadness
and
excitement
and
with
a
telegram
in
his
hand
what
has
happened
she
asked
changing
colour
and
with
dire
forebodings
in
her
heart
he
caught
her
hands
in
his
and
tried
to
smile
me
why
are
you
so
sad
she
asked
again
said
he
as
he
drew
her
to
his
breast
yourself
i
have
just
had
great
news
bad
news
you
will
deem
them
to
tell
you
from
these
few
speeches
it
may
be
gathered
that
the
cloud
that
hovered
between
this
pair
of
lovers
had
passed
away
and
that
sunshine
had
come
again
they
were
at
puddicombe
house
a
villa
of
sir
paget
which
he
had
lent
to
lord
aberfeldie
and
from
the
windows
of
which
as
it
overlooked
stokes
bay
and
spithead
from
the
clarence
parade
at
southsea
they
could
daily
see
the
departure
of
great
white
crowded
with
soldiers
highlanders
rifles
and
marines
steaming
past
the
long
line
of
the
with
all
its
naval
trophies
and
monuments
for
the
shores
of
egypt
there
too
were
in
view
the
three
forts
in
the
channel
with
puckpool
battery
at
spring
yale
which
with
the
other
in
a
line
on
the
mainland
would
effectually
bar
an
enemy
ship
from
reaching
portsmouth
harbour
ponderous
indeed
are
these
forts
one
in
particular
a
mass
of
circular
masonry
girt
by
a
black
belt
of
iron
armour
pierced
with
through
which
the
great
guns
of
period
may
spit
out
shot
and
shell
and
beyond
lies
the
peaceful
isle
of
wight
a
charming
stretch
of
sloping
land
wooded
to
the
water
edge
and
studded
with
beautiful
mansions
have
bad
news
to
tell
me
said
olive
as
the
haunting
terror
that
was
ever
before
her
struck
a
pang
to
her
heart
must
rejoin
my
regiment
at
once
it
leaves
the
castle
of
edinburgh
for
egypt
and
i
am
to
meet
it
at
woolwich
where
the
transport
awaits
it
oh
how
hard
it
is
to
part
with
you
even
for
a
time
he
added
caressing
her
as
her
head
dropped
upon
his
breast
part
thus
and
unmarried
yet
olive
after
all
our
past
folly
jealousies
and
waste
of
time
speak
to
me
darling
can
i
say
allan
replied
olive
piteously
as
her
tears
fell
fast
shall
not
go
to
this
at
the
port
admiral
of
course
our
last
evening
must
be
spent
together
allan
allan
off
those
evil
diamonds
darling
those
stones
of
ill
omen
why
did
the
mater
let
you
wear
them
they
are
never
produced
without
something
happening
the
transport
sails
when
tuesday
evening
soon
so
very
soon
darling
my
own
do
weep
so
said
he
pressing
her
closer
to
his
breast
and
nestling
her
face
in
his
neck
while
he
caressed
and
tried
to
soothe
her
but
the
impulsive
olive
would
neither
be
soothed
nor
comforted
for
a
time
when
however
she
became
calmer
he
said
must
leave
you
for
a
few
minutes
i
must
telegraph
to
the
adjutant
see
the
mater
poor
soul
and
send
apologies
as
we
shall
not
go
to
the
admiral
he
left
her
and
sinking
into
a
sofa
she
abandoned
herself
to
a
stormy
fit
of
weeping
and
to
sad
and
bitter
reflections
and
to
many
unavailing
regrets
unavailing
now
as
they
were
to
be
parted
so
soon
and
one
grim
and
harrowing
fact
stood
darkly
out
amid
them
all
her
affianced
lover
was
going
to
the
seat
of
war
and
disease
to
face
unnumbered
perils
in
that
fatal
land
of
egypt
a
slight
sound
roused
her
and
drew
her
attention
to
a
of
the
conservatory
that
opened
to
the
garden
a
man
face
seemed
glued
against
it
a
face
white
and
ghastly
apparently
regarding
her
fixedly
the
face
of
hawke
holcroft
emaciated
by
dissipation
want
or
disease
probably
by
all
three
his
shifty
eyes
bloodshot
and
wild
in
expression
in
another
moment
she
would
have
screamed
with
terror
but
he
opened
the
door
entered
and
stood
before
her
never
thought
at
least
i
was
in
hope
never
to
see
you
again
said
olive
starting
up
and
recoiling
from
him
indeed
but
in
this
world
are
not
those
always
meeting
who
are
better
far
apart
was
his
mocking
response
brings
you
here
what
do
you
want
asked
olive
gathering
courage
from
desperation
and
trembling
in
her
soul
lest
allan
should
return
and
find
this
villainous
intruder
there
do
i
want
money
i
am
and
have
been
for
days
starving
i
shall
not
be
weak
enough
to
give
you
again
under
any
threat
or
any
pressure
the
last
i
gave
you
cost
me
dearly
said
olive
firmly
though
terrified
to
find
herself
face
to
face
with
this
assassin
again
will
not
give
me
these
jewels
these
diamonds
he
said
hoarsely
and
ere
she
could
move
or
speak
he
snatched
up
the
necklace
and
pendants
from
a
pedestal
on
which
she
had
placed
them
and
thrust
them
into
his
a
time
now
the
work
of
art
i
possess
shall
be
withheld
from
the
british
public
but
for
a
time
only
and
in
the
memory
of
the
time
when
you
loved
me
or
led
me
to
believe
that
you
did
how
dare
you
say
so
she
exclaimed
tried
to
win
my
heart
and
won
it
too
you
played
with
me
fast
and
loose
as
you
did
with
your
cousin
for
whom
you
did
not
care
one
doit
then
at
least
and
for
whom
i
believe
you
care
nothing
now
olive
glanced
round
her
in
dismay
for
should
such
words
as
these
and
others
that
followed
them
reach
listening
ears
she
might
be
lost
and
she
was
powerless
to
stay
the
impetuous
current
of
his
studiously
mischievous
speech
moreover
she
did
not
see
what
hawke
holcroft
saw
behind
some
towering
ferns
and
other
plants
a
form
with
teeth
and
flashing
eye
transported
by
fury
while
his
feet
were
rooted
to
the
spot
the
face
of
allan
graham
who
saw
and
overheard
yet
failed
to
comprehend
the
situation
a
vindictive
desire
to
separate
the
lovers
if
he
could
and
to
humiliate
the
man
he
hated
took
possession
of
the
diabolical
mind
of
holcroft
who
said
me
kiss
your
hand
olive
but
once
again
ere
i
leave
you
i
whom
you
loved
once
so
well
exclaimed
the
girl
impetuously
but
ere
she
could
resist
him
or
escape
he
threw
his
arms
round
her
pressed
her
to
his
breast
kissed
her
many
times
and
then
as
allan
sprang
forward
he
quitted
the
conservatory
and
vanished
into
the
gloom
outside
while
with
a
low
wail
of
horror
and
distress
at
the
shameful
affront
put
upon
her
olive
covered
her
face
with
her
tremulous
hands
and
murmured
this
is
too
much
to
endure
much
indeed
said
a
voice
as
a
heavy
hand
grasped
her
shoulder
and
she
was
swung
round
with
a
force
that
was
almost
rude
to
meet
the
white
face
and
flaming
eyes
of
allan
she
exclaimed
piteously
and
held
out
her
hands
off
and
touch
me
not
he
cried
only
will
be
cozened
twice
he
added
unconsciously
quoting
dryden
he
gave
her
an
awful
and
withering
glance
and
snatching
up
a
heavy
stick
he
dashed
into
the
garden
after
the
intruder
whom
he
saw
in
the
act
of
escaping
by
a
gate
that
opened
upon
the
common
across
which
he
fled
like
a
hare
pursued
closely
by
allan
graham
whom
as
an
active
mountaineer
and
trained
soldier
he
was
not
likely
to
escape
the
sun
had
set
amid
dim
and
lurid
clouds
the
evening
was
gloomy
close
and
stormy
the
bellowing
of
the
ocean
could
be
heard
along
the
whole
line
of
the
from
the
spur
redoubt
to
southsea
castle
a
heavy
gale
from
the
offing
was
rolling
the
waves
in
their
force
and
fury
upon
the
shore
where
in
anticipation
thereof
the
boats
and
bathing
machines
were
all
drawn
up
high
and
dry
upon
the
shelving
shingle
the
shipping
at
anchor
were
straining
on
their
cables
and
sheet
lightning
red
and
fiery
threw
forward
in
black
outline
from
time
to
time
the
undulating
curves
of
the
isle
of
wight
but
allan
graham
saw
none
of
these
things
he
only
saw
the
fugitive
holcroft
who
ran
madly
towards
the
and
disappeared
round
the
angle
of
the
east
battery
that
overhangs
the
sea
closely
followed
by
his
infuriated
pursuer
has
happened
olive
speak
said
lady
aberfeldie
who
was
completely
bewildered
by
the
condition
in
which
she
found
olive
and
bitterly
regretting
the
absence
of
her
husband
who
was
then
in
london
and
olive
feeling
now
the
unwisdom
and
futility
of
further
concealment
told
her
all
about
the
power
holcroft
had
wielded
over
her
by
working
on
her
pride
shame
and
fear
and
how
by
direct
acting
he
had
too
probably
achieved
the
very
end
which
the
evil
prompting
of
a
moment
had
doubtless
suggested
the
placing
of
herself
in
a
false
position
with
allan
and
causing
a
hopeless
quarrel
and
separation
between
them
now
that
he
has
left
me
thus
auntie
i
shall
never
see
him
again
cried
olive
while
burying
her
face
in
her
hands
she
wept
bitterly
shall
never
forget
how
pallid
his
poor
face
became
and
how
his
eyes
glared
with
fury
through
their
unshed
tears
and
never
shall
i
forget
the
gaze
of
tenderness
astonishment
and
reproach
that
came
into
them
as
he
turned
from
me
in
bitter
silence
is
very
unfortunate
said
lady
aberfeldie
with
difficulty
restraining
her
own
tears
though
buoyed
up
by
indignation
at
the
daring
and
insolence
of
holcroft
allan
will
return
in
a
few
minutes
and
i
shall
undertake
to
explain
the
whole
affair
but
the
time
passed
on
hour
succeeded
hour
till
midnight
struck
and
aunt
and
niece
sat
watching
each
other
with
pale
and
anxious
faces
for
there
was
no
appearance
of
allan
they
supposed
that
in
his
first
gust
of
anger
he
had
gone
to
some
club
or
hotel
and
would
when
in
a
calmer
frame
of
mind
return
on
the
morrow
but
the
morrow
had
passed
into
evening
and
he
returned
no
more
olive
felt
that
he
and
she
were
roughly
rent
asunder
and
likely
to
drift
further
and
further
apart
on
the
stormy
sea
of
life
and
now
to
account
for
his
aware
that
he
had
no
mercy
to
expect
between
the
hands
of
allan
on
one
side
and
those
of
the
police
on
the
other
hawke
holcroft
thought
only
of
escape
and
dreading
flight
towards
the
town
in
the
blindness
of
his
terror
or
confusion
he
turned
towards
the
sea
and
ran
along
the
summit
of
the
steep
rocky
and
abruptly
shelving
bank
that
is
overlooked
by
the
low
and
square
squat
tower
of
southsea
castle
finding
allan
close
upon
him
so
close
that
he
could
almost
hear
his
footsteps
amid
the
bellowing
of
the
wind
and
booming
of
the
sea
that
rolled
in
white
foam
against
the
stone
parapet
wall
which
was
bordered
by
the
narrow
pathway
he
was
compelled
to
pursue
he
suddenly
turned
in
blind
desperation
and
levelled
a
revolver
at
allan
head
while
a
fury
filled
his
sallow
visage
it
snapped
hung
fire
and
was
struck
from
his
hand
by
allan
on
which
he
turned
again
and
fled
into
the
grey
obscurity
whither
allan
could
not
follow
him
now
as
the
sea
with
a
succession
of
angry
roars
was
lashing
the
steep
stony
bank
and
hurling
its
spray
over
the
parapet
wall
while
wave
after
wave
boiled
over
all
the
path
the
fugitive
had
to
pursue
again
and
again
he
saw
the
miserable
wretch
lose
his
footing
while
the
waves
tried
to
suck
him
down
and
again
and
again
clinging
with
despairing
energy
to
the
edge
of
the
stony
path
he
strove
to
recover
it
a
low
wailing
cry
of
despair
escaped
him
as
one
wave
towering
higher
than
all
the
rest
perhaps
a
tenth
wave
if
there
be
such
a
thing
enveloped
him
in
its
foamy
flood
and
sucked
him
furiously
downward
in
its
amid
which
he
seemed
to
struggle
feebly
as
a
fly
might
have
done
once
or
twice
allan
saw
his
head
bobbing
amid
the
white
foam
and
his
upthrown
hands
that
had
nothing
to
clutch
at
till
the
waves
dashed
him
again
and
again
as
if
in
wild
sport
among
a
row
of
great
wooden
dolphins
which
are
placed
in
the
shingle
there
to
break
the
fury
of
the
incoming
sea
and
stand
up
like
a
line
of
gigantic
teeth
and
in
less
than
a
minute
hawke
holcroft
vanished
from
sight
then
a
long
breath
escaped
allan
sea
has
done
it
not
i
though
richly
did
he
merit
at
my
hands
the
fate
he
has
met
thought
he
as
he
hurried
away
to
alarm
the
sentinels
and
castle
guard
but
all
too
late
to
succour
holcroft
in
any
way
or
even
to
search
for
his
body
darkness
had
set
in
now
the
fury
of
the
sea
was
increasing
and
if
hawke
holcroft
was
found
at
all
it
would
be
as
a
drowned
man
with
the
fatal
diamonds
in
his
possession
when
the
tide
ebbed
and
the
long
stretch
of
seaweed
and
shingle
was
left
dry
but
he
might
never
be
found
at
all
and
lie
as
the
skeletons
are
still
lying
there
among
the
timbers
of
the
allan
knew
that
he
was
due
with
his
regiment
at
woolwich
on
the
morrow
and
being
full
of
rage
and
bitter
disappointment
with
disgust
at
the
whole
of
this
recent
event
too
full
to
have
explanations
with
his
mother
or
hear
aught
that
olive
raymond
might
as
he
naturally
thought
be
artful
enough
to
advance
perhaps
to
brazen
out
intent
only
on
quitting
the
scene
and
if
possible
of
forgetting
a
situation
so
degrading
and
repugnant
to
his
pride
he
resolved
to
write
to
his
father
renouncing
his
cousin
for
ever
and
throwing
himself
into
a
cab
drove
straight
to
the
railway
station
and
took
the
first
train
to
london
hence
it
was
that
he
returned
to
puddicombe
house
no
more
and
as
the
train
swept
clanking
along
the
line
amid
the
monotony
of
its
sound
the
words
of
olive
song
with
what
he
deemed
her
accursed
raillery
underlying
them
came
gallingly
back
to
his
memory
with
painful
reiteration
know
a
maiden
fair
to
see
take
care
she
can
both
false
and
friendly
be
beware
beware
trust
her
not
she
is
fooling
thee
for
what
a
wretched
creature
she
has
dared
to
fool
me
he
thought
while
a
bitter
malediction
hovered
on
his
lips
in
due
time
with
all
his
comrades
of
the
black
watch
he
found
himself
on
board
the
and
after
she
had
steamed
out
of
the
albert
dock
amid
the
deafening
cheers
of
thousands
even
amid
all
the
bustle
and
high
military
enthusiasm
that
surrounded
him
he
felt
half
mad
with
grief
mortification
and
fury
night
and
day
his
mind
was
full
of
angry
and
bitter
dreams
a
conviction
of
olive
guilt
and
the
shame
of
her
discovery
were
ever
before
him
brave
young
allan
graham
was
stricken
to
the
heart
yet
he
bore
himself
graciously
and
gallantly
though
a
conviction
grew
strong
in
his
mind
that
he
would
find
his
grave
in
the
land
he
was
going
to
chapter
xix
in
the
land
of
the
pharaohs
ismailia
by
the
lake
of
timsah
lay
steeped
in
sunshine
while
the
regiments
of
the
highland
brigade
for
the
second
time
after
the
lapse
of
eighty
years
landed
upon
egyptian
soil
again
built
from
port
said
and
suez
this
new
town
protects
the
outlet
of
the
second
canal
which
carries
the
supply
of
fresh
water
from
the
nile
near
cairo
to
the
isthmus
in
the
place
where
it
stands
was
a
scene
of
sandy
desolation
seven
years
later
saw
a
brilliant
little
french
town
in
existence
with
a
broad
quay
bordering
the
lake
with
hotels
cafés
a
theatre
where
vaudevilles
were
acted
a
street
of
shops
a
public
garden
with
a
fountain
spouting
nile
water
in
the
place
champollion
the
telegraph
wires
overhead
and
the
bells
of
a
christian
church
ringing
where
but
a
short
time
before
the
wandering
bedouin
the
nomadic
dweller
in
tents
the
child
of
the
desert
with
glittering
spear
and
floating
burnous
urged
his
camel
on
its
solitary
way
from
ramses
to
serapium
the
heat
was
intense
and
to
the
eyes
of
the
scottish
mountaineers
the
scenery
about
ismailia
seemed
intensely
monotonous
cloudless
skies
of
the
deepest
and
richest
blue
formed
a
contrast
to
the
vast
expanse
of
yellow
sand
that
stretched
far
far
away
till
lost
in
hazy
distance
but
the
desert
is
susceptible
of
many
shades
and
changes
of
colour
it
is
said
that
at
ismailia
the
stranger
can
very
fully
realise
the
purity
the
balm
and
beauty
of
the
egyptian
night
especially
if
seated
over
wine
and
a
cigar
in
the
hôtel
des
voyageurs
where
he
may
watch
the
lake
of
timsah
and
so
varied
are
the
tints
of
the
latter
in
the
light
of
the
red
sun
setting
in
the
west
amid
a
lurid
glow
of
gold
and
crimson
that
it
looks
like
three
lakes
towards
the
canal
that
leads
to
serapium
it
seems
a
deep
blue
where
the
ships
are
grouped
near
ismailia
its
wavelets
seem
silver
with
gold
while
the
moon
comes
slowly
up
like
a
silver
dawn
and
rosy
tints
yet
linger
when
the
sun
has
gone
abruptly
down
but
no
time
was
given
to
the
highlanders
either
to
study
scenery
or
artistic
effects
even
if
so
disposed
each
regiment
was
rapidly
formed
in
column
every
officer
and
man
in
his
fighting
kit
with
tropical
helmet
haversack
and
water
bottle
the
men
with
their
valises
and
greatcoats
and
the
march
began
towards
the
desert
where
the
egyptians
of
arabi
awaited
them
at
little
was
talked
of
then
but
the
recent
cavalry
fight
at
kassassin
where
our
life
guards
swept
the
ranks
of
arabi
infantry
and
where
a
horde
of
wild
bedouins
who
had
been
hovering
near
the
field
like
birds
of
prey
after
their
departure
poured
in
to
strip
and
rob
the
dead
and
wounded
of
both
armies
killing
all
who
were
able
to
resist
the
mess
or
regiment
rather
as
there
was
no
mess
now
saw
that
allan
graham
had
come
back
a
sorely
changed
man
who
had
hours
of
evident
depression
alternated
by
furious
hilarity
not
the
man
old
style
at
all
but
his
world
like
hamlet
was
of
joint
the
conduct
of
olive
raymond
yet
remained
a
profound
an
unexplained
and
exasperating
mystery
to
him
but
he
felt
how
bitterly
that
love
lives
even
after
trust
and
faith
are
dead
and
buried
and
now
that
he
was
so
far
far
away
from
her
dreams
of
a
yearning
and
sorrowful
kind
with
many
stinging
thoughts
that
he
feared
would
never
leave
him
filled
his
mind
as
he
marched
at
the
head
of
his
company
towards
the
darkening
desert
in
his
looks
and
manner
evan
cameron
like
others
read
a
marked
yet
undefinable
change
his
bearing
now
was
occasionally
haughty
and
reserved
at
other
times
his
eyes
seemed
strangely
sad
what
could
have
happened
cameron
did
not
ask
and
as
yet
allan
said
nothing
about
it
and
sooth
to
say
in
his
own
thoughts
of
eveline
the
former
had
cause
to
be
sad
enough
too
his
memories
were
ever
of
the
days
at
dundargue
and
the
chance
parting
in
the
belvidere
at
maviswood
and
again
her
kisses
the
touch
of
her
little
caressing
hands
with
her
voice
came
vividly
to
him
in
some
of
the
last
papers
that
had
reached
the
transport
the
continent
he
could
see
that
she
was
leading
a
life
of
outward
gaiety
could
he
doubt
that
it
was
otherwise
than
outward
he
gathered
a
sombre
satisfaction
from
the
thought
and
then
strove
to
set
it
aside
as
selfish
why
should
she
not
enjoy
balls
and
races
and
regattas
the
at
buckingham
palace
and
other
brilliant
gatherings
yet
as
he
read
of
these
things
a
frown
of
mingled
anger
sorrow
and
even
mockery
gathered
on
his
brow
in
spite
of
himself
in
the
same
papers
allan
could
discover
no
trace
of
any
body
having
been
cast
upon
the
beach
either
at
southsea
or
the
shore
of
the
isle
of
wight
and
hence
he
supposed
that
the
remains
of
the
drowned
holcroft
must
have
been
taken
out
to
sea
the
highland
enthusiasm
the
warlike
spirit
that
blazed
up
within
him
kept
him
from
a
great
despair
for
latterly
his
love
for
olive
had
become
a
part
of
his
own
existence
the
novelty
of
the
land
in
which
our
new
campaign
had
opened
the
incessant
watchfulness
the
time
and
attention
each
duty
brought
with
it
all
gave
him
a
recklessness
as
to
life
and
as
to
fear
of
death
that
after
a
time
won
him
the
involuntary
admiration
of
the
black
watch
and
the
whole
highland
brigade
just
as
the
sun
set
the
bugles
sounded
a
after
a
march
of
six
miles
but
six
terrible
miles
they
were
for
at
every
step
the
highlanders
sank
in
the
soft
and
sand
all
around
that
a
sea
of
the
latter
seemed
to
stretch
in
every
direction
bare
and
desolate
save
where
ismailia
lay
its
edifices
looking
inky
black
and
opaque
in
outline
against
the
orange
and
primrose
sky
and
black
looked
the
masts
of
the
transports
as
they
rose
like
a
forest
amid
the
waters
of
the
lake
of
timsah
when
the
first
bivouac
was
formed
at
the
highlanders
each
rolled
in
his
blanket
on
the
soft
sand
slept
comfortably
enough
but
with
morning
came
the
first
instalment
of
misery
when
the
heavy
dew
that
soaks
everything
left
them
cold
and
stiff
and
longing
even
for
the
fierce
unclouded
sun
again
devil
of
a
country
this
said
carslogie
day
it
is
too
hot
to
eat
to
act
or
even
to
think
and
at
night
it
is
too
cold
to
sleep
or
think
of
anything
but
the
bitter
cold
itself
and
but
for
the
hot
tea
made
for
all
when
the
brigade
first
came
to
its
some
injury
to
health
must
have
ensued
but
the
men
were
too
weary
to
eat
even
a
biscuit
of
which
each
carried
a
two
days
supply
in
the
canvas
haversack
that
formed
his
only
pillow
before
the
sun
was
up
allan
rose
from
the
sand
and
looked
about
him
under
the
starlight
the
highland
bivouac
for
camp
it
was
not
presented
a
curious
sight
as
the
men
lay
in
ranks
each
rolled
in
his
blanket
beside
the
piles
of
arms
the
sentinels
of
the
on
the
way
to
standing
dark
and
motionless
against
the
blue
of
the
sky
looking
in
kilt
and
helmet
like
the
statues
of
ancient
romans
to
get
a
little
warmth
ere
the
pipers
blew
the
he
walked
a
short
distance
from
where
the
men
of
his
company
lay
and
near
a
fragment
of
ruined
wall
beside
which
grew
a
patch
of
those
prickly
plants
round
which
hillocks
of
sand
occasionally
gather
and
a
solitary
grew
he
found
rolled
up
in
a
burnous
and
evidently
concealing
himself
in
dread
and
fear
a
bedouin
there
was
a
small
near
magfar
why
did
he
not
seek
hiding
there
my
man
thought
allan
are
you
lurking
here
for
mischief
no
doubt
he
drew
his
claymore
supposing
the
lurker
could
be
but
a
spy
who
had
crept
within
our
chain
of
sentries
but
the
wild
son
of
the
desert
raised
his
hands
deprecatingly
and
opening
his
burnous
showed
that
he
was
perishing
from
a
dreadful
wound
a
sword
cut
that
had
laid
open
his
right
shoulder
and
breast
allan
put
his
to
the
sufferer
lips
raising
his
head
as
he
did
so
and
then
addressed
him
inquiringly
allan
had
picked
up
some
arabic
in
india
and
thus
could
understand
the
bedouin
who
informed
him
that
he
had
been
wounded
thus
by
one
of
those
sons
of
anak
our
in
the
charge
at
kassassin
egyptian
by
jingo
exclaimed
carslogie
who
came
up
at
that
moment
you
about
to
become
a
studier
of
humanity
cuvier
was
great
in
the
study
of
wasps
and
so
forth
why
should
i
study
egyptians
replied
allan
grimly
this
poor
devil
seems
to
have
been
wounded
in
the
affair
at
kassassin
the
other
day
understand
him
then
please
bring
one
of
the
staff
surgeons
quickly
he
must
have
been
lying
here
when
we
took
up
our
ground
the
bedouin
whose
astonishment
that
he
was
not
butchered
on
the
instant
was
great
stared
alternately
at
allan
and
at
carslogie
who
was
a
young
fellow
of
the
best
style
one
whose
fine
face
even
the
hideous
tropical
helmet
which
is
such
an
appalling
substitute
for
the
graceful
feather
bonnet
could
not
spoil
his
figure
was
slight
and
elegant
his
features
clearly
cut
and
refined
and
his
bright
brown
chestnut
hair
was
close
and
curly
the
bedouin
was
a
perfect
type
of
his
race
and
save
that
he
had
a
good
remington
rifle
slung
over
his
back
was
not
much
changed
in
habit
nature
or
turn
of
thought
from
his
ancestors
of
the
tribe
of
ishmael
though
weakened
now
by
suffering
and
great
loss
of
blood
he
seemed
spare
of
figure
and
light
of
limb
and
active
tall
but
whether
thirty
or
forty
years
old
it
was
impossible
to
say
he
had
a
long
thin
and
expressive
countenance
with
glittering
black
eyes
and
teeth
of
pearly
whiteness
his
colour
was
a
dusky
brown
his
hair
black
and
wiry
he
was
evidently
a
bedouin
of
the
desert
as
the
two
ends
of
the
scarlet
shawl
which
formed
his
turban
hung
down
upon
the
shoulder
to
distinguish
him
from
the
arabs
of
other
tribes
he
was
clad
in
a
thick
dark
brown
baracan
of
wool
which
served
as
a
dress
by
day
and
a
bed
by
night
over
which
was
a
robe
with
wide
sleeves
when
the
doctor
was
dressing
his
wound
which
was
certainly
a
terrible
his
richly
embroidered
girdle
was
seen
and
this
announced
him
to
be
a
sheikh
and
such
he
was
proved
to
be
as
allan
gathered
from
him
that
his
name
was
zeid
el
ourdeh
the
sheikh
of
a
tribe
near
jebel
dimeshk
between
the
desert
and
the
disused
railway
to
heliopolis
city
of
the
sun
and
as
he
lay
there
in
his
picturesque
costume
with
a
group
of
wondering
highlanders
in
their
dark
kilts
and
white
helmets
gathered
round
him
and
the
sun
in
the
distance
coming
swiftly
up
out
of
the
dry
sand
of
the
yellow
desert
as
it
seemed
allan
thought
what
a
subject
was
the
whole
for
the
pencil
of
an
artist
the
bedouin
was
on
the
point
of
fainting
so
great
was
the
agony
occasioned
by
the
dressing
of
his
wound
but
a
mouthful
from
flask
revived
him
more
than
it
would
have
done
one
usually
accustomed
to
such
stimulants
sick
men
are
going
back
to
the
rear
at
ismailia
said
allan
please
to
order
the
ambulance
people
to
come
this
way
i
send
this
unfortunate
creature
to
the
third
field
hospital
carslogie
paused
to
scrape
a
vesta
and
light
a
cigar
which
he
proceeded
to
puff
with
a
sigh
of
satisfaction
carslogie
cried
allan
have
no
time
to
lose
the
bugles
will
sound
immediately
and
carslogie
went
on
his
way
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
thought
the
world
would
be
none
the
worse
for
having
a
bedouin
the
less
in
it
in
his
own
language
and
in
terms
peculiarly
his
own
allan
could
make
out
that
the
sheikh
was
thanking
him
in
a
low
and
earnest
voice
and
adding
that
while
life
lasted
he
always
deem
him
as
a
brother
you
infidels
are
powerful
as
the
genii
of
old
you
can
flash
a
light
at
night
brilliant
as
that
of
the
sun
at
noon
you
have
another
light
that
springs
from
the
unseen
air
i
have
seen
it
in
the
streets
of
cairo
no
doubt
referring
to
gas
you
can
send
your
thoughts
from
land
to
land
under
the
sea
more
swiftly
than
even
the
afrite
did
in
the
days
of
solomon
and
i
fear
that
from
your
hands
the
egyptians
will
suffer
such
chastisement
as
fell
on
the
people
of
noah
of
ad
and
of
thamud
he
added
wearily
and
sadly
as
his
head
fell
on
one
side
a
party
of
the
ambulance
had
now
come
and
allan
informed
him
that
he
was
to
be
sent
to
ismailia
he
did
more
he
placed
some
money
in
his
hand
wherewith
to
procure
necessaries
and
while
the
eyes
of
the
bedouin
gleamed
with
gratitude
his
brown
mahogany
and
attenuated
fingers
closed
avariciously
and
tightly
on
such
an
unusual
gift
as
coins
pon
my
soul
allan
graham
said
carslogie
how
these
rascals
treated
our
wounded
at
kassassin
your
humanity
to
say
the
least
of
it
seems
to
me
to
be
a
little
misplaced
but
i
can
not
help
it
i
feel
a
little
just
now
said
allan
with
a
smile
as
the
wounded
bedouin
of
whom
he
had
not
seen
the
last
was
borne
away
the
pipes
struck
up
and
once
more
the
columns
began
a
march
to
mahsameh
the
gordon
highlanders
were
in
advance
the
camerons
next
then
came
the
highland
light
infantry
and
then
the
black
watch
all
toiling
through
the
soft
deep
sand
these
splendid
regiments
were
all
marching
in
massed
columns
at
one
pace
interval
the
cavalry
moving
with
them
collaterally
on
one
flank
and
the
artillery
on
the
other
clattering
along
with
spunges
buckets
spare
wheels
and
forge
waggons
all
forming
a
grand
impressive
spectacle
in
the
midst
of
the
wide
egyptian
desert
to
scottish
soldiers
who
are
usually
so
in
their
bible
history
the
soil
they
were
treading
if
the
toil
made
it
disgusting
on
one
hand
memory
made
it
full
of
deep
interest
on
the
other
they
knew
that
they
were
already
in
or
were
approaching
the
land
of
goshen
where
by
the
tasks
they
had
conned
at
school
and
those
which
their
ministers
superintended
they
were
aware
that
they
were
nigh
unto
the
place
where
jacob
dwelt
of
old
that
he
might
be
near
to
joseph
who
lived
at
pharaoh
court
near
to
the
place
where
father
and
son
met
and
where
we
still
find
rameses
which
was
built
by
the
israelites
in
the
days
of
their
bondage
and
as
our
soldiers
marched
on
some
there
were
who
recalled
these
things
to
each
other
as
their
minds
went
back
to
the
village
kirk
whose
bells
awoke
the
echoes
of
green
and
lonely
glens
and
to
the
firesides
of
their
fathers
when
expounding
on
these
things
on
saturday
night
when
the
bible
was
produced
and
though
they
might
yawn
wearily
over
such
matters
at
home
these
scriptural
names
and
localities
had
a
very
different
effect
upon
them
now
chapter
xx
the
march
through
goshen
on
and
on
and
on
through
the
same
kind
of
egyptian
landscape
tame
barren
and
insipid
so
terribly
vapid
and
flatly
horrid
when
compared
with
the
salvatoresque
hills
and
glens
of
their
native
land
the
naked
plain
bounded
by
occasional
hillocks
at
vast
distances
the
toilsome
march
of
the
highlanders
continued
yet
there
are
luxuriant
plains
in
some
parts
of
the
land
of
goshen
sometimes
were
seen
with
trunks
bare
and
slender
or
wigwams
on
the
causeways
but
it
is
a
land
that
with
all
its
vast
antiquity
and
religious
associations
of
which
no
poet
has
ever
sung
indeed
could
an
egyptian
sing
on
the
reed
of
gesner
or
theocritus
asks
volney
sees
neither
limpid
streams
nor
verdant
lawns
nor
solitary
caves
and
is
equally
a
stranger
to
valleys
and
impending
rocks
miss
martineau
is
almost
the
only
traveller
who
claims
for
egypt
the
attributes
of
the
picturesque
and
varied
in
beauty
and
there
were
incessant
swarms
of
scorpions
gnats
and
more
especially
of
flies
one
of
the
many
plagues
of
egypt
which
were
so
numerous
that
it
was
impossible
to
eat
the
dry
ration
biscuits
without
the
chance
of
swallowing
these
pests
also
more
than
once
on
the
summit
of
a
sandy
hillock
there
would
appear
sharply
defined
against
the
clear
blue
sky
the
picturesque
figure
of
a
mounted
bedouin
with
his
white
burnous
floating
about
him
a
tall
spear
or
a
long
musket
slung
by
his
side
a
man
unchanged
in
aspect
or
ideas
from
his
nomadic
forefathers
who
saw
the
mailed
crusaders
toiling
on
their
way
to
jerusalem
gazing
with
stolid
wonder
at
the
marching
columns
in
a
costume
so
strange
with
bare
knees
white
sporrans
and
kilts
of
tartan
waving
at
every
step
while
on
the
hot
and
breathless
air
there
was
borne
towards
him
the
hoarse
and
shrill
music
of
the
pipes
the
same
wild
music
that
eighty
years
before
woke
the
echoes
of
the
pyramids
and
of
the
streets
of
grand
cairo
but
what
land
in
the
world
has
not
echoed
to
their
music
all
our
soldiers
were
more
or
less
full
of
enthusiasm
anxious
to
get
at
arabi
to
grapple
with
the
enemy
get
the
business
over
as
they
phrased
it
though
it
is
doubtful
if
they
quite
believed
in
sir
garnet
wolseley
apparently
boastful
prediction
that
the
war
would
be
ended
by
the
of
that
month
september
in
the
exuberance
of
their
spirits
many
chorussed
merrily
when
the
pipes
ceased
which
was
seldom
lilting
as
a
writer
says
only
scots
can
do
as
in
the
days
when
their
country
was
redolent
of
song
when
the
sang
some
old
chant
to
her
cows
in
field
or
byre
when
the
span
at
her
when
the
reapers
filled
the
with
melody
and
the
ploughman
in
winter
when
he
turned
the
glistening
furrows
over
the
lea
and
now
and
anon
the
bedouin
scouts
would
wheel
their
horses
round
and
vanish
ere
our
cavalry
could
reach
them
to
bear
to
the
terrible
tidings
as
some
said
devils
in
petticoats
were
coming
and
as
others
asserted
with
beards
down
to
their
knees
every
man
had
one
hundred
rounds
of
and
his
bottle
filled
with
water
from
the
canal
called
by
the
soldiers
jocularly
soup
from
its
hue
and
quality
thus
a
ration
of
rum
when
it
was
served
out
proved
very
acceptable
though
some
there
were
who
did
not
much
affect
the
cold
tea
and
allan
could
not
help
smiling
at
a
little
argument
that
ensued
between
corporal
macsnish
of
his
company
and
one
of
the
who
to
their
honour
be
it
said
kept
up
with
the
troops
went
under
fire
with
them
and
after
the
conflict
did
all
in
their
power
to
alleviate
the
sufferings
of
the
wounded
grumble
corporal
said
the
i
know
it
is
a
soldier
privilege
he
who
paints
the
lilies
of
the
field
and
feeds
the
sparrow
will
supply
all
you
want
i
hope
so
whateffer
but
a
corporal
of
the
black
watch
is
worth
a
good
many
sparrows
i
can
tell
you
and
as
for
the
cold
tea
ugh
for
you
than
all
the
liquor
in
the
world
my
man
said
the
the
worst
whusky
whateffer
would
be
better
to
my
mind
and
we
have
scripture
for
it
that
we
should
not
drink
water
alone
said
the
reader
doubtfully
urged
the
corporal
who
knew
his
bible
well
we
not
told
in
maccabees
chapter
xv
and
verse
that
it
is
hurtful
to
drink
wine
or
water
alone
as
wine
mingled
with
water
is
pleasant
and
delighteth
the
taste
all
that
replied
the
agree
with
sir
garnet
that
water
is
alone
the
drink
for
man
the
only
man
that
holy
writ
records
as
ever
asking
for
it
did
get
it
was
and
we
all
know
where
was
then
scripture
again
said
the
corporal
with
a
smirk
on
his
sharp
highland
face
and
thinking
he
had
decidedly
the
best
of
the
argument
during
a
halt
on
this
march
some
of
the
troops
constructed
out
of
blankets
and
rifles
with
fixed
bayonets
erections
like
gipsy
tents
to
shelter
them
from
the
blazing
heat
of
the
sun
and
a
singular
kind
of
encampment
they
presented
with
ship
biscuits
and
tinned
meat
and
some
brandy
to
flavour
their
cold
tea
allan
graham
cameron
carslogie
and
some
other
officers
of
the
corps
made
themselves
as
comfortable
as
they
could
under
shelter
of
their
impromptu
tents
and
many
were
even
jolly
especially
carslogie
who
was
rather
a
noisy
and
irrepressible
fellow
stretched
on
the
sand
with
his
tropical
helmet
tilted
back
on
his
head
he
drank
his
tea
as
he
called
it
though
it
was
stiff
grog
and
proffered
his
to
all
this
jolly
he
exclaimed
of
this
we
might
have
been
out
in
the
blazing
open
then
he
struck
up
a
verse
of
a
song
to
the
air
of
the
of
old
gaul
and
composed
by
an
anonymous
writer
though
he
hinted
it
was
john
bright
talk
of
a
good
time
when
warfare
shall
cease
and
the
nations
hobnob
a
big
pipe
of
peace
and
the
lion
and
the
lamb
in
auriferous
mead
on
bills
of
exchange
in
beatitude
feed
but
keep
your
powder
dry
my
boys
and
keep
your
bayonets
keen
the
world
ca
do
without
us
yet
nor
will
it
soon
i
ween
then
stern
and
true
where
work
to
do
we
do
it
as
we
can
and
shoulder
to
shoulder
still
march
in
the
van
good
time
predicted
seems
a
long
way
off
yet
he
added
with
a
sigh
to
find
that
the
last
of
his
grog
was
gone
for
after
a
hot
morning
march
it
was
as
he
said
a
sybaritish
luxury
well
a
little
time
will
find
us
face
to
face
with
arabi
and
we
shall
exchange
the
fleshpots
of
egypt
for
those
of
the
old
country
this
was
the
of
september
and
the
march
was
resumed
at
five
in
the
evening
for
the
at
kassassin
where
the
column
found
its
tents
pitched
allan
shared
his
with
cameron
and
like
their
comrades
they
proceeded
to
make
themselves
as
comfortable
as
they
could
but
it
soon
became
known
that
on
the
morrow
the
highland
brigade
was
to
lead
in
the
night
attack
upon
the
formidable
entrenchments
of
arabi
pasha
at
last
bugle
some
of
us
may
ever
hear
will
sound
at
six
evening
said
allan
as
he
and
cameron
after
a
picnic
kind
of
repast
lay
on
the
floor
of
the
tent
and
smoked
their
havanas
with
their
jackets
open
and
minus
collars
and
ties
for
the
evening
was
hot
then
though
cold
and
dew
came
together
the
moment
the
sun
went
down
and
then
there
was
no
light
in
the
tent
save
those
of
the
stars
to
carslogie
singing
in
his
tent
no
sombre
reflections
seem
to
come
to
him
said
cameron
of
us
of
course
will
lose
the
number
of
our
mess
as
the
sailors
say
said
allan
again
after
a
pause
it
is
not
a
cheerful
thought
allan
said
cameron
life
is
not
particularly
rosy
with
me
just
now
so
i
am
just
the
fellow
to
have
a
charmed
one
when
under
fire
again
is
a
history
in
all
men
lives
cameron
it
is
said
well
there
is
a
devil
of
a
lot
in
mine
more
than
i
care
for
have
long
seemed
rather
low
in
spirit
have
reason
replied
allan
while
that
inexpressible
longing
to
talk
of
himself
and
his
sorrows
which
seizes
upon
men
now
and
then
came
upon
him
and
he
related
to
cameron
the
whole
story
of
his
engagement
with
his
cousin
his
doubts
and
fears
the
intrusions
and
outrageous
insults
put
upon
them
both
by
hawke
holcroft
who
seemed
to
wield
some
degrading
and
mysterious
power
once
a
power
that
was
ended
now
he
added
after
his
narrative
was
ended
trust
under
heaven
never
to
look
upon
her
false
fair
face
again
cameron
heard
his
strange
story
in
silent
amazement
all
this
not
be
explained
he
asked
want
no
explanation
i
have
been
degraded
enough
replied
allan
bitterly
cameron
strangely
enough
had
never
as
yet
even
to
his
early
friend
and
comrade
made
any
reference
to
what
the
latter
fully
knew
his
love
for
eveline
and
never
once
had
her
name
escaped
him
during
the
long
voyage
in
the
nepaul
from
woolwich
to
ismailia
nor
even
on
the
march
towards
the
enemy
poor
cameron
had
thought
what
was
the
use
of
speaking
of
that
matter
now
when
all
was
hopeless
all
over
and
for
ever
between
them
but
now
encouraged
or
melted
by
allan
graham
new
confidence
in
himself
he
said
reference
to
the
risks
we
run
tomorrow
i
am
glad
that
i
set
my
house
in
order
did
so
indeed
before
we
marched
from
edinburgh
stratherroch
or
what
remains
of
it
what
way
evan
we
must
all
die
sooner
or
later
a
soldier
sooner
perhaps
than
a
civilian
so
by
will
if
aught
happens
to
me
i
have
left
the
old
place
tower
and
hill
wood
glen
and
water
to
to
eveline
i
mean
to
lady
paget
heavens
to
eveline
exclaimed
allan
his
face
full
of
a
surprise
that
was
unseen
in
the
starlight
and
darkened
bell
tent
you
no
one
else
save
my
brother
duncan
who
has
himself
a
large
fortune
none
whom
i
love
as
as
i
love
her
added
cameron
in
a
very
broken
voice
evan
i
always
suspected
indeed
knew
of
it
did
evan
and
your
sister
loved
you
god
yet
was
sacrificed
to
another
they
wrung
each
other
hands
in
the
dark
and
both
remained
silent
for
a
time
each
full
of
his
own
thoughts
and
in
the
gloom
seeing
nothing
but
the
end
of
the
other
cigar
paget
is
so
rich
that
he
will
think
little
of
stratherroch
even
when
cleared
of
its
heavy
encumbrances
said
evan
he
may
think
rather
wrathfully
of
the
donor
though
i
trust
and
hope
he
may
never
get
it
and
now
evan
i
have
to
parade
the
inlying
picquet
get
some
sleep
if
you
can
old
fellow
we
need
all
our
metal
on
the
morrow
and
allan
taking
his
dirk
and
claymore
hurried
away
full
of
thought
for
if
his
friend
really
fell
this
odd
bequest
of
stratherroch
might
compromise
his
sister
with
her
elderly
spouse
and
it
was
impossible
to
make
any
change
circumstanced
as
they
were
then
is
said
that
every
man
has
a
history
and
that
every
man
outlives
it
thought
allan
wonder
how
it
will
be
with
poor
evan
and
me
and
now
to
parade
the
picquet
with
that
paragon
of
picquets
parade
at
sunset
here
however
the
sun
sets
before
we
have
time
to
think
of
it
but
the
fight
will
be
to
evan
and
me
for
a
time
at
least
what
opium
was
to
de
quincey
and
the
author
of
the
ancient
mariner
fool
fool
fool
that
i
am
to
think
of
here
at
all
he
left
evan
cameron
inspired
by
a
mingled
emotion
of
gratitude
and
satisfaction
for
evan
now
knew
and
felt
certain
that
had
eveline
been
in
allan
gift
she
might
have
been
his
bride
ere
this
and
with
this
conviction
in
his
mind
he
strove
to
court
sleep
while
roused
ever
and
anon
as
in
india
by
the
wild
cry
of
the
jackal
sir
garnet
wolseley
had
now
come
up
the
brigade
of
guards
also
and
the
whole
strength
of
the
british
force
was
concentrated
at
kassassin
the
place
of
our
cavalry
victory
where
our
horse
so
gallantly
charged
and
swept
sword
in
hand
through
the
brigades
of
egyptian
guns
in
the
dark
with
the
next
day
dawn
those
officers
who
like
the
master
of
aberfeldie
cameron
and
others
advanced
beyond
a
palm
wood
that
grew
near
the
camp
could
distinctly
see
with
their
against
the
bright
orange
tint
shed
on
the
sky
by
the
sun
the
strong
earthworks
of
crowning
the
hillocks
and
manned
by
more
than
twenty
thousand
regular
troops
the
flower
of
the
army
of
arabi
who
commanded
them
in
person
and
when
the
sun
rose
higher
the
infantry
could
be
seen
lining
the
trenches
with
all
their
serried
bayonets
flashing
in
the
sunshine
beyond
these
formidable
earthworks
the
egyptian
camp
could
be
seen
in
the
distance
spreading
far
away
an
almost
unbroken
line
of
tents
which
if
they
had
all
occupants
betokened
the
presence
of
a
very
great
force
indeed
as
more
than
one
reconnoitring
officer
remarked
to
another
many
were
full
of
disappointment
lest
there
might
be
no
fighting
after
all
as
the
preceding
morning
the
sound
of
heavy
firing
had
been
heard
in
the
rear
of
the
egyptian
position
and
there
seemed
a
prospect
of
internal
dissension
facilitating
a
dissolution
of
the
whole
enemy
force
others
more
wisely
suggested
that
arabi
was
only
practising
his
artillery
to
obtain
the
range
in
case
his
position
was
turned
and
attacked
in
the
rear
though
some
asserted
that
the
deep
booming
of
the
guns
was
too
steady
and
continuous
for
mere
practice
of
that
nature
the
british
troops
had
only
a
five
days
reserve
of
provisions
but
it
was
generally
known
that
the
country
was
rich
and
full
of
subsistence
beyond
the
lines
of
and
that
we
would
carry
these
no
man
under
wolseley
doubted
moreover
he
had
with
him
sixty
of
the
finest
pieces
of
cannon
in
the
world
the
day
passed
on
and
evening
drew
nigh
the
eventful
day
of
the
september
when
every
man
was
prepared
to
or
die
higher
and
higher
beat
every
heart
at
six
the
in
was
sounded
far
along
the
lines
and
quietly
as
if
upon
parade
at
home
that
stately
soldier
of
the
black
watch
paraded
and
posted
the
markers
for
the
various
companies
of
his
corps
them
with
his
usual
accuracy
the
orders
were
brief
but
emphatic
perfect
silence
was
to
be
maintained
for
the
march
and
as
the
place
was
to
be
carried
in
grand
old
british
style
at
the
point
of
the
bayonet
on
no
account
was
an
order
to
load
to
be
issued
each
man
carried
a
hundred
rounds
of
ball
with
one
day
provisions
and
his
tin
filled
with
cold
tea
the
tents
were
struck
and
the
baggage
piled
for
conveyance
to
the
rear
in
case
of
a
reverse
which
no
man
thought
possible
the
sun
went
swiftly
down
westward
of
the
point
of
attack
beyond
zagazig
darkness
fell
as
swiftly
over
the
desert
and
the
triple
lines
of
canal
that
flow
between
both
mahsameh
and
abassa
and
then
our
army
fourteen
thousand
strong
including
foot
horse
and
artillery
began
in
silence
the
midnight
march
for
the
last
march
as
it
proved
to
many
a
brave
young
fellow
as
the
regiment
moved
off
allan
thought
of
evan
communication
and
an
irrepressible
regret
and
anxiety
took
possession
of
him
as
he
had
an
unaccountable
presentiment
that
his
friend
was
doomed
to
fall
in
the
coming
strife
of
himself

thought
