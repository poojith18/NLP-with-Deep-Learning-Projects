you
could
not

in
one
short
day
what
love
they
bore
each
wordsworth
london
in
september
a
dull
close
airless
day
the
streets
would
have
been
dusty
enough
too
no
doubt
had
there
been
a
breath
to
stir
the
dust
which
one
felt
instinctively
was
lying
there
in
masses
ready
on
the
slightest
provocation
to
rise
in
choking
clouds
a
day
when
one
longed
for
the
sea
or
failing
that
for
a
breeze
of
fresh
air
a
day
when
one
could
hardly
believe
in
the
reality
of
cool
green
fields
or
babbling
trickling
brooks
not
that
it
was
so
much
hot
for
there
was
little
sun
as
dry
and
heavy
and
intensely
dull
dull
everywhere
but
especially
so
in
one
of
the
somewhat
but
unmistakably
respectable
squares
of
which
there
are
not
a
few
in
london
so
much
resembling
each
other
as
to
require
no
special
description
the
square
at
this
season
looked
its
very
dullest
and
ugliest
under
these
circumstances
i
should
suppose
the
more
nearly
fulfilling
the
aim
as
regards
outward
appearance
of
the
melancholy
architects
who
planned
it
half
the
houses
were
and
of
the
remainder
several
were
evidently
shortly
about
to
be
so
for
in
some
hot
and
dusty
housemaids
were
to
be
seen
pulling
down
window
curtains
and
in
one
or
two
more
an
acute
observer
by
dint
of
a
little
peeping
might
have
discovered
trunks
and
ready
packed
and
strapped
for
starting
or
else
gaping
open
while
undergoing
the
mysterious
process
called
in
some
of
the
lower
regions
where
such
domestic
rites
are
usually
performed
in
one
of
the
dullest
of
the
dull
houses
in
a
sort
of
library
or
morning
room
on
the
first
floor
a
young
girl
sat
alone
the
room
was
not
a
pretty
one
at
the
best
of
times
it
might
have
been
called
comfortable
but
nothing
more
for
its
furniture
though
solid
and
good
of
its
kind
was
like
the
rest
of
the
house
heavy
dark
and
ungraceful
on
this
day
the
room
looked
especially
uninviting
for
there
was
about
it
that
peculiar
look
of
disorder
which
even
in
the
neatest
of
households
inevitably
accompanies
preparations
for
torn
letters
bits
of
string
and
address
labels
a
half
emptied
of
its
contents
all
told
their
own
tale
the
only
pretty
thing
in
the
room
was
its
occupant
she
was
certainly
not
beautiful
but
like
many
people
to
whom
that
word
in
its
ordinary
and
superficial
sense
could
not
be
truthfully
applied
she
was
most
thoroughly
pleasant
to
look
upon
possibly
a
thought
too
thin
and
hardly
rosy
enough
for
what
one
likes
to
see
in
a
girl
of
nineteen
but
with
no
lack
of
health
and
vigour
in
her
firm
well
set
frame
and
pale
though
not
sallow
complexion
and
with
no
want
of
intelligence
or
quick
perception
in
her
grey
eyes
as
a
glance
from
them
would
soon
have
told
a
good
gentle
pretty
girl
just
such
i
think
as
one
would
like
to
see
own
daughter
though
with
rather
more
thoughtfulness
of
expression
than
seems
quite
natural
in
so
young
a
creature
this
came
however
from
her
rather
too
quiet
and
solitary
life
and
from
no
original
dearth
of
the
bright
hopefulness
and
gaiety
of
spirit
hardly
in
theory
to
be
separated
from
the
idea
of
healthy
youth
the
girl
sat
at
her
but
not
writing
rather
wearied
with
all
her
little
preparations
she
felt
glad
to
sit
still
doing
nothing
and
though
looking
very
thoughtful
as
was
her
habit
still
to
tell
the
truth
she
was
thinking
of
little
in
particular
there
was
perfect
silence
through
the
house
and
the
occasional
roll
of
wheels
in
the
neighbouring
streets
sounded
rumbling
and
heavy
through
the
still
drowsy
air
marion
i
think
was
very
nearly
on
the
point
of
succumbing
to
these
various
influences
by
falling
asleep
outright
when
her
reveries
were
disturbed
by
a
sharp
sudden
ring
at
the
she
started
up
but
sat
down
again
lazily
saying
to
herself
oh
i
forgot
it
will
be
only
evidently
not
being
a
person
to
be
treated
with
much
ceremony
but
a
second
start
was
in
store
for
poor
nerves
had
she
been
conscious
of
possessing
any
such
undesirable
things
a
interval
and
then
came
the
sound
of
hasty
feet
up
the
stairs
the
door
opened
suddenly
and
an
unexpected
visitor
entered
a
boy
of
course
no
one
but
a
boy
and
one
too
in
a
hurry
could
have
come
up
stairs
in
that
sort
of
way
or
opened
the
door
with
that
indescribable
sort
of
fling
neither
bang
nor
jerk
though
partaking
of
the
nature
of
both
though
after
all
perhaps
it
is
hardly
fair
to
this
particular
boy
to
introduce
him
as
so
thoroughly
one
of
his
rather
objectionable
class
for
when
he
was
not
in
a
hurry
or
very
unusually
out
of
temper
harry
vere
my
brother
did
not
by
any
means
forget
the
small
proprieties
of
life
a
good
boy
in
the
main
certainly
neither
a
sneak
nor
a
bully
his
looks
would
have
belied
him
had
he
been
either
he
had
a
fair
open
honest
face
with
however
much
less
strength
than
his
and
also
less
promise
of
future
development
he
hurried
in
looking
flushed
and
and
anxious
too
as
the
quick
observation
was
not
slow
to
discover
she
exclaimed
here
how
did
you
get
off
and
what
is
the
matter
is
anything
wrong
asking
after
the
manner
of
people
in
a
hurry
to
get
an
answer
three
questions
where
one
would
have
served
the
purpose
no
nothing
is
wrong
said
the
boy
least
nothing
much
i
have
not
been
expelled
or
broken
my
legs
as
you
can
see
for
yourself
get
into
a
fuss
i
only
came
up
because
i
wanted
so
much
to
see
you
before
you
go
you
shall
hear
all
about
it
in
a
minute
but
first
tell
me
one
thing
my
father
is
still
away
there
no
fear
of
his
seeing
me
today
no
not
the
least
replied
the
girl
evidently
by
no
means
surprised
at
the
unfilial
spirit
of
the
question
has
been
away
since
monday
and
return
till
the
day
after
tomorrow
but
i
am
leaving
tomorrow
you
know
when
i
heard
your
ring
i
thought
it
was
cissy
archer
for
i
am
expecting
her
this
afternoon
to
settle
definitely
about
our
train
i
see
though
she
added
glancing
at
the
be
here
for
an
hour
yet
so
we
have
plenty
of
time
for
a
so
very
much
said
harry
i
must
have
some
luncheon
as
i
get
back
to
school
till
late
and
my
train
goes
in
an
hour
and
a
half
you
can
fancy
how
very
much
i
wanted
to
see
you
marion
for
even
though
i
came
my
fare
will
all
by
clear
me
out
and
i
now
get
leave
to
be
away
again
before
christmas
so
i
shall
miss
the
match
at
barrow
next
before
answering
marion
rang
the
bell
and
ordered
some
cold
provisions
in
the
way
of
luncheon
for
her
brother
as
the
servant
was
leaving
the
room
harry
said
to
him
rather
awkwardly
and
hesitatingly
you
say
anything
to
your
master
about
my
having
come
up
to
see
miss
vere
before
she
brown
being
fortunately
of
the
order
of
discreet
domestics
answered
simply
well
sir
i
will
take
care
that
your
wishes
are
attended
to
muttering
however
to
himself
as
soon
as
he
was
outside
the
door
for
poor
master
harry
that
none
of
them
other
chattering
idiots
saw
him
come
and
that
i
got
the
cold
beef
and
bread
unbeknownst
to
when
harry
was
comfortably
seated
at
his
repast
marion
repeated
her
request
harry
tell
me
all
about
marion
the
long
and
the
short
of
it
is
got
into
a
scrape
not
a
bad
one
though
added
he
hurriedly
seeing
the
increasing
anxiety
in
his
eyes
disgraceful
or
ungentlemanly
you
would
never
fear
that
for
me
may
it
was
a
good
while
ago
but
i
did
not
tell
you
about
it
at
midsummer
because
i
thought
then
i
should
be
able
to
set
it
right
but
now
it
has
got
worse
i
know
i
was
a
fool
for
my
pains
to
hide
it
from
you
several
months
ago
one
holiday
at
school
i
hired
a
horse
of
course
it
is
against
the
rules
but
lots
of
follows
do
it
i
am
really
very
fond
of
riding
though
i
know
about
it
but
i
think
i
should
have
been
tempted
to
do
it
in
this
underhand
sort
of
way
if
my
father
had
sometimes
let
me
have
a
little
in
the
holidays
but
know
as
well
as
i
how
he
thwarts
me
but
an
old
story
well
as
would
have
it
i
lamed
the
beast
i
am
no
judge
of
horses
but
still
i
think
it
was
above
the
average
of
a
livery
stable
the
man
made
an
awful
row
said
he
had
that
morning
refused
sixty
pounds
for
it
and
it
was
now
worthless
he
threatened
to
complain
to
the
i
know
what
is
the
law
in
such
matters
but
i
was
in
such
a
fright
that
he
would
really
tell
on
me
that
i
made
on
the
spot
the
best
terms
i
could
with
him
which
were
to
pay
him
twenty
pounds
down
the
next
morning
though
when
i
promised
this
i
had
not
the
least
idea
where
to
get
the
money
i
went
straight
to
cuthbert
my
great
chum
you
know
marion
and
told
him
all
about
it
he
begged
me
not
to
make
a
fuss
and
i
should
have
the
money
in
time
and
sure
enough
by
next
morning
he
had
it
for
me
and
i
paid
the
man
as
i
had
cuthbert
said
marion
in
amazement
could
he
get
it
harry
his
people
are
not
at
all
rich
and
i
should
think
he
has
even
less
than
indeed
replied
harry
the
pull
cuthbert
knew
i
would
pay
him
as
soon
as
i
could
and
he
has
been
awfully
good
about
it
but
only
last
week
he
came
to
me
in
great
distress
and
told
me
the
whole
affair
it
seems
he
got
the
money
in
his
own
name
from
a
wretched
jew
at
a
hideous
rate
of
interest
trusting
to
my
being
able
to
pay
him
in
part
any
way
last
mouth
as
i
quite
hoped
i
should
have
got
something
from
aunt
tremlett
on
my
birthday
of
course
she
was
ill
and
sent
me
nothing
now
poor
cuthbert
must
pay
it
before
the
of
october
and
this
wretch
has
made
it
somehow
or
other
come
to
thirty
instead
of
twenty
pounds
the
exposure
would
utterly
ruin
cuthbert
the
horrible
part
of
it
to
think
what
my
folly
has
brought
him
into
good
fellow
that
he
is
why
he
never
spends
a
sixpence
he
can
help
on
himself
now
marion
what
can
i
do
how
ever
am
i
to
get
thirty
pounds
before
the
of
october
only
i
had
it
sighed
poor
marion
you
know
i
never
have
five
pounds
in
my
own
hands
much
less
know
that
quite
well
i
never
had
the
least
idea
of
getting
it
from
you
may
all
thought
of
was
that
as
two
heads
are
better
than
one
you
might
help
me
to
find
out
some
way
of
getting
it
of
course
if
the
worst
comes
to
the
worst
rather
than
let
cuthbert
suffer
i
will
go
to
my
father
he
would
pay
it
i
have
no
doubt
but
would
probably
never
speak
to
me
again
any
way
all
chance
of
my
going
into
the
army
would
be
over
and
just
when
i
am
so
close
upon
it
too
leaving
school
at
christmas
for
good
oh
what
a
fool
i
was
but
for
both
your
sake
and
my
own
may
i
would
rather
do
anything
than
speak
to
my
father
it
would
be
perfectly
horrible
to
have
to
do
it
i
declare
i
would
rather
run
away
if
only
i
could
beg
borrow
or
steal
the
money
in
the
first
harry
said
his
sister
talk
nonsense
but
think
seriously
what
to
do
if
only
aunt
tremlett
had
not
been
so
ill
she
might
have
helped
she
indeed
replied
the
boy
impatiently
if
she
had
even
agreed
to
do
so
she
would
have
been
pretty
sure
to
discover
that
it
was
her
duty
to
tell
my
father
old
idiot
that
she
need
not
waste
your
time
in
abusing
her
harry
for
as
things
are
she
is
out
of
the
question
but
harry
dear
she
added
anxiously
as
the
sound
of
the
clock
striking
caught
her
ear
fear
your
time
is
almost
up
but
said
the
boy
with
a
rather
poor
attempt
at
a
laugh
marion
you
see
any
way
to
helping
me
out
of
my
trouble
and
think
what
a
time
it
will
be
before
we
see
each
other
again
you
are
to
be
at
altes
with
cissy
archer
for
six
months
you
say
months
certainly
i
believe
said
his
sister
should
like
the
thoughts
of
it
exceedingly
but
for
the
one
drawback
of
not
seeing
you
in
the
holidays
but
that
be
helped
and
now
about
this
trouble
or
yours
harry
do
nothing
just
yet
wait
any
way
till
the
end
of
the
month
that
will
be
a
fortnight
from
now
and
i
will
see
if
by
then
i
can
hit
upon
any
plan
to
prevent
your
having
to
tell
papa
for
that
would
really
be
too
dreadful
not
so
much
the
disagreeable
of
it
as
the
after
consequences
for
he
would
never
forgive
it
or
trust
you
said
harry
emphatically
marion
i
must
go
thank
you
dear
for
being
so
kind
about
it
many
a
sister
would
have
scolded
or
preached
but
i
am
far
more
sorry
than
if
you
had
done
either
well
then
write
within
a
fortnight
and
send
your
address
i
suppose
you
know
it
yet
good
bye
and
mind
you
fuss
about
me
more
than
you
can
and
with
a
more
affectionate
parting
hug
than
he
would
perhaps
have
liked
brown
major
or
jones
minor
to
be
witness
to
harry
departed
his
heart
considerably
lighter
as
is
the
way
with
selfish
mankind
for
having
shared
its
burden
with
another
marion
poor
child
sat
down
again
where
he
had
found
her
burying
her
face
in
her
hands
as
she
vainly
tried
to
solve
the
problem
so
unexpectedly
placed
before
her
to
find
thirty
pounds
she
had
never
before
actually
cared
about
the
possession
of
any
sum
of
money
for
though
by
no
means
luxuriously
brought
up
still
as
is
the
case
with
many
young
people
the
comforts
of
life
had
as
it
were
for
her
peculiar
ideas
as
to
the
inexpediency
of
treating
his
children
as
reasonable
or
responsible
beings
had
left
her
in
many
practical
respects
singularly
inexperienced
she
had
certainly
often
wished
like
all
young
people
in
a
passing
way
for
things
beyond
her
reach
but
still
whatever
was
really
necessary
to
her
comfort
or
suitable
for
her
position
vere
had
provided
and
paid
for
in
proportion
therefore
to
her
previous
exemption
from
anything
in
the
shape
of
financial
anxieties
were
her
alarm
and
consternation
at
the
present
difficulty
and
terrible
indeed
appeared
the
alternative
of
laying
the
matter
before
her
falter
sad
perversion
of
what
should
be
the
most
tender
and
trustful
of
relations
that
between
parent
and
child
when
in
his
distress
and
perplexity
or
even
in
his
shame
and
remorse
the
first
impulse
instead
of
being
to
fly
for
counsel
or
comfort
to
the
one
friend
who
should
never
refuse
it
is
at
all
costs
to
conceal
his
trouble
from
the
parent
who
has
indeed
succeeded
in
inspiring
him
with
fear
and
distrust
alas
with
nothing
more
and
this
is
done
every
day
not
by
hard
or
indifferent
fathers
only
but
by
many
who
according
to
their
light
honestly
enough
desire
to
do
their
best
by
the
young
creatures
committed
to
their
charge
vere
the
father
of
this
boy
and
girl
was
perhaps
less
to
be
blamed
than
some
parents
for
the
fact
that
his
children
did
not
regard
him
as
their
friend
an
extreme
natural
reserve
of
character
and
manner
had
in
his
case
been
so
augmented
by
the
unhappy
circumstances
of
his
life
that
to
his
children
from
their
earliest
years
he
had
never
appeared
otherwise
than
hard
forbidding
and
utterly
unsympathising
yet
in
reality
he
was
a
man
of
deep
feeling
and
capable
of
strong
and
lasting
attachments
but
along
with
these
healthy
characteristics
were
to
be
found
in
him
a
large
amount
of
morbid
weakness
on
certain
points
and
a
peculiarity
which
i
can
best
describe
as
the
one
passion
of
his
life
had
been
his
love
for
his
wife
a
lovely
silly
mindless
baby
whose
early
death
was
certainly
not
the
bitterest
disappointment
she
caused
him
their
carried
life
was
short
but
it
lasted
long
enough
for
the
freezing
narrowing
process
to
begin
in
the
heart
he
lost
faith
in
affection
or
at
least
in
his
own
power
of
inspiring
it
the
want
of
breadth
about
him
prevented
his
seeing
that
though
he
had
been
so
unfortunate
as
to
make
the
one
mistake
an
uncongenial
marriage
it
did
not
necessarily
follow
that
every
other
relation
in
life
was
for
him
to
be
in
like
manner
a
failure
he
made
up
his
mind
beforehand
that
were
he
to
allow
himself
to
seek
for
consolation
in
the
love
of
his
children
in
that
too
he
would
but
be
laying
up
fresh
disappointment
for
himself
and
therefore
he
was
weak
and
cowardly
enough
to
stifle
so
far
as
he
could
the
natural
outflowings
of
fatherly
affection
he
did
not
altogether
succeed
in
this
for
his
heart
was
still
in
spite
of
himself
sound
at
the
core
but
alas
as
time
went
on
it
proved
no
exception
to
that
law
of
our
nature
by
which
all
unused
members
gradually
contract
and
wither
from
his
earliest
years
as
i
said
vere
checked
in
himself
all
outward
demonstration
of
affection
and
this
of
course
quickly
reacted
upon
them
little
people
are
not
slow
to
understand
when
they
and
their
innocent
caresses
are
unsought
if
not
unwelcome
fortunately
however
for
these
poor
little
things
they
had
each
other
and
the
affection
of
two
as
honest
loving
little
hearts
as
ever
beat
refused
vent
in
one
direction
only
flowed
the
more
vehemently
in
the
remaining
one
and
to
give
the
father
his
due
he
certainly
was
not
unmindful
or
careless
of
their
actual
comforts
and
requirements
they
had
everything
to
be
desired
for
their
health
and
happiness
except
their
love
as
they
grew
older
time
brought
no
improvement
to
the
state
of
matters
extreme
strictness
not
to
say
severity
was
the
basis
of
theory
of
education
this
and
the
fact
that
he
never
in
the
slightest
degrees
confided
in
his
children
or
appeared
to
consider
them
as
reasonable
and
intelligent
companions
extended
the
already
wide
gulf
between
them
yet
he
continued
solicitous
about
their
health
and
comfort
and
was
even
scrupulously
careful
in
his
choice
of
their
teachers
books
and
the
few
companions
he
thought
it
wise
to
allow
them
had
any
one
taxed
him
with
not
fulfilling
to
the
utmost
his
duties
as
a
parent
he
would
have
been
utterly
amazed
and
indignant
for
so
and
warped
had
his
whole
being
become
through
the
one
great
mistake
of
his
life
that
it
simply
never
entered
his
imagination
that
by
not
loving
his
children
he
was
denying
to
them
the
first
of
their
natural
rights
or
that
his
systematic
coldness
could
possibly
be
to
them
an
actual
injury
and
injustice
for
himself
he
came
in
time
to
be
so
absorbed
in
other
interests
those
of
a
political
life
as
not
in
the
least
to
miss
the
affection
he
had
so
deliberately
stifled
in
its
birth
in
a
rather
narrow
way
a
clever
though
never
a
brilliant
man
accurate
painstaking
and
calm
he
gradually
became
very
useful
to
his
party
and
thus
contentedly
enough
he
lived
his
life
rather
congratulating
himself
than
otherwise
on
what
he
had
made
of
it
and
on
the
strength
of
character
which
had
so
thoroughly
thrown
off
and
outgrown
the
bitter
disappointment
of
his
early
manhood
the
childhood
and
youth
of
marion
and
her
brother
had
not
however
been
on
the
whole
desolate
or
unhappy
indeed
it
takes
a
great
deal
thank
god
to
crush
the
happiness
out
of
healthy
children
i
and
they
miss
what
they
have
never
known
the
first
great
sorrow
was
going
to
school
but
at
the
name
period
a
kindly
disposed
and
very
terrible
governess
appearing
on
the
scene
life
was
by
no
means
solitary
and
loveless
as
she
had
anticipated
the
happiest
times
they
remembered
poor
children
were
the
summer
months
holidays
which
with
this
kind
miss
jervis
they
every
year
spent
in
brentshire
their
native
county
and
where
he
still
owned
near
the
little
village
of
bradley
a
pretty
cottage
and
a
few
acres
of
remains
of
a
once
considerable
property
in
brentshire
too
at
the
dull
little
town
of
mallingford
lived
the
old
aunt
tremlett
godmother
from
whom
they
learned
the
few
particulars
they
ever
knew
of
their
pretty
young
mother
and
her
early
death
their
father
never
accompanied
them
to
brentshire
he
still
shrank
with
a
morbid
horror
from
ever
revisiting
the
place
where
he
had
first
met
his
wife
and
where
so
few
years
after
she
was
buried
the
veres
had
in
past
days
been
people
of
no
small
consideration
in
their
own
county
and
though
for
two
generations
the
head
of
the
family
had
been
settled
in
a
different
part
of
england
there
were
still
plenty
of
people
about
mallingford
to
whom
the
name
in
itself
was
a
recommendation
to
show
kindness
to
the
two
children
who
bore
it
and
as
they
were
loveable
and
engaging
they
soon
gained
hearts
on
their
own
account
there
was
old
temple
the
clergyman
who
had
married
their
parents
and
seen
the
sad
end
of
that
story
and
his
two
daughters
in
particular
miss
veronica
who
played
the
organ
on
sundays
and
sometimes
invited
may
or
harry
as
a
great
treat
to
sit
up
in
the
loft
beside
her
then
there
was
jolly
old
baldwin
of
the
bank
always
so
merry
and
hearty
and
geoffrey
his
son
the
great
tall
schoolboy
who
used
to
carry
both
children
at
once
when
they
were
very
small
one
perched
on
each
shoulder
he
came
to
see
them
one
christmas
in
london
and
told
them
of
his
kind
death
looking
so
sad
and
lonely
that
both
marion
and
harry
cried
when
he
went
away
that
was
several
years
ago
but
they
had
never
seen
geoffrey
baldwin
since
for
as
they
grew
older
their
visits
to
brentshire
became
fewer
and
at
last
ceased
altogether
their
father
sold
the
cottage
and
the
midsummer
holidays
were
now
spent
in
london
with
the
exception
of
a
fortnight
or
so
at
the
seaside
if
it
happened
to
strike
mr
were
that
town
was
unhealthy
in
hot
weather
for
young
people
i
think
there
is
very
little
more
to
tell
of
early
life
simple
and
uneventful
enough
it
had
been
and
with
but
few
of
what
are
usually
considered
young
special
privileges
and
pleasures
but
on
the
whole
by
no
means
an
unwholesome
training
for
a
rich
and
vigorous
nature
though
it
might
have
crushed
and
stunted
a
poorer
one
such
society
as
since
she
grew
to
womanhood
she
had
seen
at
her
house
had
been
almost
confined
to
that
of
the
few
friends
whom
he
now
and
then
invited
to
a
somewhat
ponderous
dinner
clever
men
all
of
them
in
their
different
ways
interested
if
not
absorbed
in
topics
much
of
which
marion
hardly
understood
but
from
which
not
being
a
young
lady
her
quick
intelligence
led
her
to
glean
much
material
for
quiet
thought
and
speculation
which
certainly
did
her
no
harm
and
probably
more
good
than
the
touches
she
would
at
this
period
have
been
undergoing
had
her
education
been
more
in
accordance
with
prescribed
rules
that
anything
in
the
shape
of
a
so
called
was
necessary
or
even
advisable
for
his
daughter
had
never
occurred
to
the
mind
of
vere
but
as
some
of
his
friends
took
a
kindly
interest
in
the
girl
she
had
not
been
quite
without
an
occasional
glimpse
into
the
doings
of
the
gay
world
and
now
a
very
unexpected
treat
was
before
her
in
the
prospect
of
spending
several
months
at
the
wintering
place
of
altes
under
the
care
of
the
pleasantest
of
chaperons
the
aforesaid
cissy
archer
six
or
seven
years
before
this
when
marion
was
a
thin
shy
little
girl
of
twelve
or
thereabouts
this
cousin
then
cecilia
lacy
had
been
to
her
a
vision
of
beauty
and
loveliness
such
as
she
could
hardly
imagine
excelled
by
any
even
of
her
favourite
fairy
princesses
and
this
childish
admiration
had
not
been
misplaced
cissy
had
been
an
exceedingly
pretty
girl
and
now
at
was
an
exceedingly
pretty
woman
a
good
little
soul
too
as
ever
lived
possibly
not
exactly
with
discretion
but
so
thoroughly
and
genuinely
amiable
bright
and
winning
that
it
was
utterly
impossible
to
wish
her
in
any
respect
other
than
she
was
she
had
married
happily
her
husband
was
considerably
older
than
herself
and
by
his
rather
overwhelming
superabundance
of
discretion
good
judgement
and
all
other
model
qualities
of
the
kind
more
than
atoned
for
his
pretty
impulsive
deficiencies
if
indeed
they
could
be
called
such
there
were
people
who
called
colonel
archer
a
prig
but
it
was
well
for
them
that
loyal
little
cissy
never
heard
the
sacrilege
for
dissimilar
as
they
were
yet
the
two
were
entirely
of
one
mind
in
the
most
important
respect
of
each
thinking
the
other
little
short
of
perfection
the
greater
part
of
their
married
life
had
been
spent
in
india
where
their
only
trouble
had
been
extremely
delicate
health
which
at
last
about
a
year
before
this
time
had
obliged
her
to
return
home
to
try
the
effects
of
the
long
sea
voyage
and
english
air
the
experiment
had
in
a
great
measure
proved
successful
and
cissy
now
hoped
to
be
able
before
very
long
to
rejoin
her
husband
the
one
winter
however
which
since
her
return
she
had
spent
in
england
had
rather
tried
her
strength
in
consequence
of
which
she
had
been
advised
to
spend
the
coming
six
months
of
cold
weather
in
a
milder
climate
she
was
now
therefore
on
the
point
of
starting
for
altes
accompanied
by
her
only
child
a
very
small
boy
known
as
charlie
and
also
to
her
great
delight
by
her
young
cousin
marion
vere
a
pretty
stout
battle
cissy
had
fought
with
the
awful
vere
before
obtaining
his
consent
to
his
joining
the
little
party
but
archer
had
what
the
old
nurses
call
way
with
her
and
the
uncle
had
rather
a
weakness
for
his
captivating
niece
she
was
the
child
of
his
dead
sister
whom
not
so
very
long
ago
he
remembered
just
as
bright
and
happy
as
her
daughter
was
now
so
the
end
of
it
was
as
might
have
been
expected
vere
gave
in
and
cissy
came
off
triumphant
master
charlie
at
the
age
of
five
and
a
half
was
already
one
of
that
terrible
frightfully
spoilt
by
his
mother
since
he
had
had
the
misfortune
to
be
under
her
exclusive
care
and
yet
a
loveable
little
monkey
too
for
the
spoiling
had
principally
resulted
in
making
him
preternaturally
sharp
rather
than
selfish
or
exacting
he
was
a
chivalrous
mite
in
his
way
he
firmly
believed
himself
to
have
been
entrusted
by
his
father
with
the
exclusive
care
of
his
mother
and
thought
it
simply
a
matter
of
course
that
his
opinion
should
be
asked
before
any
important
step
could
be
decided
upon
his
extreme
views
on
the
subject
of
had
for
some
days
caused
the
journey
to
altes
to
remain
in
abeyance
but
a
bright
suggestion
of
his
that
he
might
turn
his
experiences
to
profit
by
writing
a
book
about
these
objects
of
his
aversion
and
their
queer
ways
had
carried
the
day
triumphantly
his
deficiencies
in
literary
respects
for
he
had
not
yet
succeeded
in
mastering
the
alphabet
fortunately
presented
no
insurmountable
difficulties
as
he
had
already
engaged
the
services
of
miss
vere
as
amanuensis
at
a
liberal
rate
of
a
penny
a
week
provided
she
was
good
and
wrote
all
the
book
in
red
ink
with
a
gold
chapter
ii
across
the
channel
known
he
could
speak
greek
as
naturally
as
pigs
can
hudibras
as
harry
vere
turned
the
corner
of
the
square
a
carriage
drove
past
him
in
the
direction
of
his
house
it
passed
quickly
but
not
before
he
had
recognised
the
lady
seated
in
it
a
blessing
thought
he
to
himself
cissy
was
looking
the
other
way
or
as
sure
as
fate
she
would
have
stopped
and
me
in
that
way
of
hers
people
all
say
she
is
so
lively
and
charming
i
dare
say
she
is
but
all
the
same
i
think
marion
is
worth
a
dozen
of
and
so
thinking
the
boy
hailed
a
passing
hansom
and
was
quickly
whirled
off
to
the
railway
station
marion
sitting
alone
meditating
sadly
enough
on
harry
and
his
troubles
was
soon
interrupted
a
soft
rustle
outside
the
door
gently
opened
and
her
cousin
entered
marion
dear
said
she
as
she
kissed
her
am
in
such
a
terrible
fuss
and
have
been
so
busy
all
the
morning
that
i
have
not
got
half
my
shopping
done
so
if
you
mind
instead
of
my
staying
home
will
you
come
out
with
me
and
help
me
to
finish
it
and
we
can
settle
all
our
plans
on
the
all
means
replied
marion
shall
be
ready
in
two
minutes
and
so
she
was
being
in
certain
respects
somewhat
of
an
exception
to
in
general
there
are
i
think
some
advantages
to
a
girl
in
being
brought
up
in
a
masculine
household
with
no
sisters
to
back
her
small
delinquencies
she
is
pretty
sure
sooner
or
later
to
discover
that
it
is
really
much
better
and
more
comfortable
to
follow
the
example
of
the
menkind
about
her
in
such
trifles
as
punctuality
and
other
of
the
kind
adherence
to
which
women
in
general
seem
to
consider
by
no
means
an
addition
to
their
charms
hardly
was
archer
again
seated
in
the
carriage
when
she
commenced
to
pour
into
the
sympathising
ear
of
her
cousin
the
recital
of
her
many
and
all
but
overpowering
afflictions
think
marion
said
she
with
the
most
tone
whole
day
have
i
been
rushing
about
in
this
carriage
to
one
after
another
only
varied
by
frantic
dives
into
institutions
for
finding
or
rather
not
finding
unexceptionable
governesses
me
of
all
people
on
earth
to
be
entrusted
with
the
selection
of
a
model
governess
as
if
i
long
ago
forgotten
every
thing
any
of
mine
ever
taught
me
though
i
must
say
looking
for
nurses
is
almost
as
bad
and
with
the
horrible
feeling
on
me
all
the
time
of
how
this
carriage
hire
will
be
running
up
it
is
really
too
bad
of
that
tiresome
old
lady
and
that
stupid
girl
just
when
i
meant
to
be
so
economical
too
and
clear
off
all
my
bills
before
going
away
for
i
really
owe
such
a
dreadful
amount
i
declare
marion
i
have
a
great
mind
to
set
off
for
india
at
once
instead
of
going
to
all
this
medley
of
grievances
little
archer
ran
through
in
such
a
hurry
that
but
for
being
pretty
well
accustomed
to
her
rather
bewildering
way
of
talking
marion
would
have
been
utterly
at
a
loss
to
make
sense
or
it
knowing
by
previous
experience
that
it
was
useless
to
attempt
to
put
a
word
till
cissy
stopped
from
sheer
want
of
breath
she
patiently
waited
till
this
occurred
and
then
said
quietly
cissy
you
should
have
some
pity
on
my
dullness
of
apprehension
why
have
you
been
running
about
to
i
heard
nothing
of
all
this
last
night
when
i
saw
you
i
the
slightest
idea
what
tiresome
old
lady
and
stupid
girl
you
are
talking
about
nor
can
i
see
how
going
to
india
would
pay
your
debts
goodness
sake
marion
be
so
precise
and
methodical
or
shake
you
replied
cissy
could
i
have
told
you
last
night
what
i
myself
know
till
this
morning
and
as
to
my
bills
of
course
i
am
all
right
in
india
as
george
looks
after
me
there
he
is
so
dreadfully
particular
never
to
owe
anything
and
not
to
spend
too
much
and
it
is
knowing
this
that
makes
me
hate
so
not
to
manage
with
what
he
sends
me
for
i
know
it
is
the
very
utmost
he
can
afford
i
suppose
i
am
one
of
those
people
aunt
tremlett
always
speaks
of
as
deficient
in
good
management
my
but
i
really
help
it
too
old
to
we
shall
be
very
economical
at
altes
cissy
said
marion
cheerfully
let
you
buy
anything
not
even
velvet
suits
for
charlie
though
sure
you
want
money
more
than
i
do
she
continued
with
a
sigh
child
what
nonsense
exclaimed
her
cousin
you
get
money
itself
you
get
worth
and
no
trouble
of
bills
or
any
thing
you
are
talking
rubbish
marion
wait
till
you
are
married
and
the
cares
of
life
are
upon
you
before
you
talk
wanting
true
nevertheless
maintained
marion
never
mind
about
that
now
you
yet
explained
about
the
nurse
and
governess
difficulty
whom
are
you
looking
out
for
not
for
yourself
i
thought
you
were
so
pleased
with
the
maid
you
had
engaged
and
you
want
a
governess
for
charlie
course
not
but
that
reminds
me
that
i
promised
to
buy
him
a
bottle
of
red
ink
let
me
forget
and
also
a
wedding
present
for
him
to
give
to
foster
for
she
is
a
good
soul
really
she
has
put
off
her
visit
home
till
next
week
so
that
she
will
see
us
safe
off
from
paris
it
was
only
this
morning
i
heard
that
the
maid
i
had
engaged
possibly
come
she
is
ill
or
something
it
is
impossible
to
get
one
in
her
place
at
such
short
notice
so
i
have
made
up
my
mind
as
foster
can
go
so
far
with
us
to
wait
till
we
get
to
altes
and
get
a
french
girl
there
to
look
after
charlie
it
will
be
just
as
well
for
she
can
teach
him
french
provided
he
does
not
take
it
into
his
head
to
hate
her
for
being
what
he
calls
a
a
bit
of
him
if
you
tell
him
it
would
be
rude
and
silly
i
wish
however
that
i
could
have
helped
you
by
taking
my
maid
but
you
see
i
do
so
unless
it
had
been
arranged
before
for
mine
you
know
is
a
rather
venerable
individual
and
acts
housekeeper
to
some
extent
tell
me
now
about
the
governess
said
cissy
was
a
letter
i
got
this
morning
from
old
lady
severn
they
have
just
returned
to
altes
from
some
place
or
other
where
they
have
been
during
the
summer
and
she
is
in
a
great
state
to
get
a
good
english
governess
for
the
very
few
daily
governesses
there
have
as
much
as
they
can
do
so
hearing
accidentally
of
my
going
there
she
write
to
ask
me
if
i
can
hear
of
one
as
it
would
be
so
much
more
satisfactory
for
me
to
see
the
unfortunate
young
lady
in
the
first
place
i
daresay
it
would
but
where
the
being
in
question
is
to
be
seen
i
yet
discovered
i
have
got
the
names
and
addresses
of
two
or
three
to
tell
her
about
but
i
think
they
seem
particularly
what
does
an
old
lady
want
with
a
governess
asked
marion
you
say
lady
severn
was
old
of
course
answered
archer
or
seventy
or
eighty
for
all
i
know
a
regular
old
lady
but
that
does
not
prevent
her
having
grandchildren
does
it
surely
though
marion
you
have
heard
of
the
severns
lady
severn
is
a
of
lord
in
brentshire
did
you
never
hear
of
them
there
not
that
i
remember
said
marion
thoughtfully
you
know
i
have
not
been
there
for
several
years
how
is
it
the
live
with
lady
severn
are
their
parents
dead
both
replied
cissy
how
we
know
them
i
mean
she
went
on
was
owing
to
george
and
these
father
the
eldest
brother
having
been
great
friends
at
school
and
college
old
lady
severn
was
devotedly
attached
to
this
son
sir
john
the
father
died
many
years
ago
and
she
has
always
kept
up
a
correspondence
with
george
for
his
sake
she
and
i
have
never
met
but
she
has
written
very
cordially
several
times
and
i
was
quite
pleased
to
hear
this
morning
of
their
being
at
altes
i
should
have
got
her
letter
sooner
but
not
knowing
my
address
she
sent
it
to
mother
at
cheltenham
to
forward
to
me
which
has
you
see
caused
all
this
hurry
and
fuss
about
a
governess
at
the
last
many
children
are
there
asked
marion
both
girls
ten
and
twelve
i
think
their
ages
are
their
father
died
two
years
ago
so
their
uncle
ralph
severn
is
now
the
head
of
the
family
lady
severn
has
never
got
over
sir
death
it
was
very
sudden
the
result
of
an
accident
he
was
her
favourite
too
i
fancy
she
cares
very
much
for
sir
ralph
but
as
far
as
i
can
judge
think
it
is
very
much
to
be
wondered
asked
marion
he
not
a
good
son
dear
yes
said
cissy
good
in
every
respect
in
fact
i
fancy
he
is
something
of
a
prig
and
not
half
so
attractive
as
his
brother
was
and
besides
sir
ralph
has
not
been
very
much
with
his
own
family
john
severn
was
splendidly
handsome
george
has
often
told
me
a
grand
tall
fair
man
and
with
the
most
winning
manners
the
sort
of
man
who
did
everything
well
riding
and
shooting
and
all
those
sorts
of
things
you
know
no
wonder
his
mother
was
proud
of
him
whereas
ralph
is
quite
different
quite
unlike
his
family
for
they
are
all
remarkably
handsome
people
and
he
is
not
at
all
so
i
should
say
dark
and
sallow
and
gloomy
looking
horribly
learned
too
i
believe
a
great
antiquary
and
able
to
read
all
the
languages
of
the
tower
of
babel
been
told
so
sure
to
be
fusty
and
musty
he
spent
several
years
poking
about
for
all
manner
of
old
books
and
manuscripts
somewhere
in
the
do
you
happen
to
know
so
much
about
him
did
you
ever
see
him
enquired
once
on
our
way
to
india
he
met
us
at
cairo
he
had
been
somewhere
i
think
but
when
i
saw
him
he
was
in
the
middle
of
his
poking
for
these
dirty
old
books
i
thought
him
a
great
bore
but
george
rather
liked
him
he
had
not
the
slightest
idea
then
of
getting
the
title
and
i
believe
he
hates
having
it
but
i
declare
marion
we
have
been
chattering
so
about
the
severns
that
we
said
a
word
about
our
whereupon
ensued
a
bradshaw
and
murray
discussion
in
which
cissy
having
previously
crammed
for
the
occasion
came
out
very
strong
marion
felt
dull
and
depressed
but
glad
that
her
prevented
her
observing
that
she
was
less
lively
than
usual
the
shopping
was
at
last
satisfactorily
executed
just
as
they
were
about
to
separate
at
door
marion
remembered
a
message
which
her
father
had
charged
her
to
deliver
to
archer
cissy
she
exclaimed
said
i
was
to
tell
you
that
instead
of
leaving
money
with
me
here
for
my
expenses
he
has
sent
some
to
paris
so
that
you
have
any
trouble
about
the
exchange
i
was
to
ask
you
when
we
got
there
to
call
at
somebody
or
bank
i
have
the
name
written
down
and
there
you
will
find
fifty
pounds
waiting
for
you
to
use
for
me
and
then
papa
wants
you
after
getting
to
altes
to
make
a
sort
of
calculation
as
to
what
my
expenses
will
be
and
he
will
send
whatever
sum
you
prospect
exclaimed
cissy
me
drawing
out
a
set
of
what
do
you
call
them
that
the
word
uncle
vere
as
to
the
average
prices
and
probable
amount
of
bread
meat
fruit
c
likely
to
be
consumed
by
a
young
lady
with
a
healthy
appetite
in
the
course
of
six
months
i
declare
i
do
it
marion
but
see
when
we
get
there
so
good
bye
till
tomorrow
morning
i
impress
upon
such
a
model
as
you
the
expediency
of
being
ready
in
time
and
not
forgetting
your
and
so
saying
she
drove
away
the
next
morning
saw
our
little
group
of
travellers
fairly
started
on
their
journey
archer
in
a
violent
but
amiable
state
of
fuss
charlie
thoughtful
and
meditative
as
became
a
author
but
perfectly
ready
nevertheless
to
take
the
whole
party
luggage
included
under
his
small
wing
and
inclined
also
to
be
severe
and
cutting
to
his
nurse
on
the
subject
of
her
lachrymose
condition
owing
to
the
fast
approaching
separation
from
her
darling
what
told
you
thousands
of
times
foster
he
observed
you
love
me
better
than
robinson
then
marry
me
and
we
shall
never
be
parted
no
more
but
if
you
do
marry
him
i
be
angry
and
come
and
have
tea
with
you
on
sundays
if
let
me
spread
my
own
marion
was
standing
by
the
idly
eyeing
its
contents
when
the
sound
of
a
voice
beside
her
enquiring
for
a
newspaper
struck
her
with
a
sound
and
involuntarily
she
glanced
at
the
speaker
he
was
quite
a
young
man
six
or
seven
and
twenty
at
most
he
appeared
to
be
the
momentary
glimpse
of
his
face
before
he
turned
away
gave
her
the
same
vague
impression
of
having
met
him
before
though
where
or
when
she
had
no
idea
a
very
pleasant
face
any
way
it
was
somehow
words
when
describing
sir
john
severn
to
her
the
day
before
came
into
her
mind
grand
tall
fair
man
with
the
most
winning
of
which
last
in
the
present
case
she
had
soon
an
opportunity
of
judging
for
at
that
moment
charlie
running
up
to
her
eagerly
stumbled
and
fell
poor
little
fellow
full
length
on
the
hard
platform
the
blow
to
his
dignity
was
worse
than
the
bump
on
his
head
and
his
mingled
feelings
would
in
another
moment
have
been
beyond
his
control
had
not
the
stranger
in
the
kindest
and
gentlest
way
lifted
the
child
from
the
ground
holding
him
in
his
arms
while
he
carefully
wiped
the
dusty
marks
from
his
face
and
hands
all
right
again
nothing
for
a
brave
little
man
like
you
to
cry
for
sure
said
he
brightly
at
which
exhortation
charlie
was
speedily
himself
again
you
very
much
said
marion
charlie
go
hack
to
your
but
at
the
sound
of
her
voice
the
stranger
started
he
began
but
the
sentence
was
never
completed
for
at
that
moment
went
the
bell
rang
and
archer
hurrying
up
swept
them
all
off
in
her
train
leaving
the
young
man
standing
with
a
puzzled
expression
on
his
face
as
marion
involuntarily
smiling
at
their
mutual
perplexity
half
bowed
in
farewell
as
she
passed
him
could
that
be
cissy
said
she
when
they
were
at
length
satisfactorily
settled
amidst
railway
rugs
and
shawls
and
charlie
having
related
his
misfortunes
to
his
mother
had
been
further
consoled
by
a
biscuit
could
it
be
she
repeated
tall
fair
man
who
picked
charlie
up
so
kindly
i
am
sure
i
have
seen
him
but
cissy
had
not
observed
him
and
though
marion
amused
herself
by
trying
to
guess
the
riddle
she
not
succeed
in
doing
so
the
incident
however
was
not
without
its
use
for
during
the
long
journey
to
paris
it
took
her
thoughts
a
little
off
what
had
been
engrossing
them
to
an
undesirable
troubles
thinking
seemed
to
bring
her
no
suggestion
as
to
any
way
of
obtaining
the
thirty
pounds
so
she
at
last
made
the
manful
resolution
for
a
time
to
dismiss
the
subject
from
her
mind
and
when
arrived
at
altes
if
no
other
idea
should
strike
her
to
consult
with
cissy
who
was
certainly
enough
and
also
thoroughly
to
be
trusted
once
she
really
understood
the
necessity
for
silence
on
any
particular
subject
the
journey
to
paris
including
that
horror
of
mild
voyagers
crossing
the
channel
was
safely
accomplished
a
day
or
two
in
the
paradise
of
milliners
during
which
time
cissy
underwent
torments
compared
to
which
those
of
tantalus
were
as
nothing
from
the
sight
of
palaces
of
delight
yclept
de
modes
into
which
she
dared
not
venture
and
from
which
her
only
safety
was
in
flight
a
heartrending
parting
scene
between
foster
and
her
beloved
master
charlie
whose
heroic
fortitude
gave
way
at
the
last
and
again
the
little
party
now
reduced
to
three
are
off
on
their
travels
my
dear
marion
said
cissy
with
the
air
of
a
very
small
jeanne
about
to
lead
an
army
into
battle
our
adventures
are
about
to
begin
behold
in
me
your
only
pillar
of
defence
your
only
refuge
in
danger
that
sort
of
thing
you
know
do
be
quiet
charlie
what
is
the
matter
with
you
promised
to
buy
one
a
gun
in
case
we
meet
wobbers
and
fiefs
said
charlie
she
mind
child
get
you
one
at
altes
i
only
wish
we
were
there
said
his
mother
cissy
have
you
heard
any
more
about
our
lodgings
at
altes
enquired
marion
dear
yes
i
got
an
answer
to
any
letter
just
as
we
started
this
morning
but
hardly
read
it
yet
and
as
she
spoke
archer
drew
it
from
her
pocket
all
right
it
is
from
bailey
the
english
doctor
at
altes
to
whom
mine
at
home
gave
me
an
introduction
really
very
kind
he
says
he
has
engaged
a
charming
apartement
for
me
and
cheap
too
and
that
the
daughter
of
the
is
it
marion
oh
i
see
the
propriétaire
yes
the
daughter
of
the
propriétaire
madame
poulin
will
be
very
happy
to
act
as
maid
and
look
after
charlie
a
blessing
and
he
bailey
will
send
some
one
to
meet
us
on
our
arrival
so
after
all
marion
we
need
not
be
afraid
of
meeting
with
much
in
the
way
of
inventures
fiefs
mamma
asked
charlie
if
they
are
you
he
afraid
i
can
pummel
them
even
without
a
gun
and
take
care
of
you
too
may
if
you
charlie
said
marion
laughing
not
forget
your
and
then
turning
to
cissy
she
asked
if
she
knew
anyone
else
at
altes
besides
lady
severn
had
one
or
two
introductions
archer
replied
i
know
no
one
personally
except
old
major
and
berwick
who
are
residents
there
they
used
to
live
at
clifton
and
one
of
the
daughters
was
at
school
with
me
she
be
very
young
now
for
she
was
some
years
older
than
and
so
chatting
from
time
to
time
they
beguiled
the
weariness
of
a
long
day
shut
up
in
a
railway
carriage
charlie
fortunately
was
very
good
and
when
he
got
tired
of
looking
out
of
the
window
had
the
good
sense
to
compose
himself
for
a
little
siesta
which
lasted
till
they
were
close
to
the
town
where
they
were
to
stay
for
the
night
this
they
spent
in
a
queer
sort
of
hotel
where
the
windows
of
the
rooms
all
looked
into
each
other
and
the
beds
were
panelled
into
the
wall
something
like
those
in
old
scotch
farmhouses
i
write
of
some
few
years
ago
no
doubt
imperial
rule
has
by
this
time
tout
cela
and
travelling
in
france
is
probably
fast
becoming
as
commonplace
as
anywhere
else
the
rest
of
the
journey
which
occupied
two
long
days
was
performed
en
diligence
an
irksome
enough
mode
of
procedure
as
those
who
have
had
the
misfortune
to
be
shut
up
in
a
coupé
for
twenty
or
thirty
hours
it
a
stretch
cam
testify
the
country
for
some
distance
was
fertile
and
here
and
there
when
one
got
rid
of
the
poplars
even
picturesque
but
halfway
to
altes
on
the
last
day
it
altogether
changed
in
character
becoming
utterly
waste
and
sterile
now
as
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
nothing
was
to
be
seen
on
either
side
of
the
road
but
long
stretches
of
bleak
barren
moorland
hardly
indeed
correctly
described
by
that
word
for
our
northern
moors
have
a
decided
though
peculiar
beauty
of
their
own
wholly
wanting
in
the
great
wastes
of
this
part
of
france
known
as
to
add
to
the
gloomy
effect
of
the
scene
a
close
drizzling
rain
began
to
fall
and
continued
without
the
slightest
break
the
whole
of
that
dreary
afternoon
marion
though
neither
morbid
nor
was
yet
like
all
sensitive
and
refined
organisations
keenly
alive
to
the
impressions
of
the
outer
world
a
ray
of
sudden
sunshine
a
tiny
patch
of
the
exquisitely
bright
green
moss
one
sometimes
sees
amidst
a
mass
of
dingy
browns
and
olives
or
the
coming
unexpectedly
towards
the
close
of
a
dusty
summer
ramble
on
one
of
those
fairylike
wells
of
coolest
purest
water
all
shaded
round
by
a
bower
or
drooping
ferns
and
bracken
and
such
things
as
these
caused
her
to
thrill
with
utterly
inexpressible
delight
but
on
the
other
side
she
of
necessity
suffered
actual
pain
from
trifles
which
in
coarser
natures
waken
no
sense
of
jar
or
discord
i
do
not
however
believe
that
this
latter
class
of
feelings
is
ever
roused
by
nature
herself
except
where
she
has
been
distorted
or
in
some
way
interfered
with
even
in
her
gloomiest
and
wildest
aspects
the
impression
she
makes
upon
us
is
of
awe
but
never
horror
of
melancholy
but
never
revulsion
of
pain
in
some
mysterious
way
so
far
transcending
pleasure
as
to
be
to
my
thinking
the
most
exquisite
of
all
such
sensations
in
a
mood
sat
marion
this
dull
september
afternoon
in
the
ugly
dingy
old
french
diligence
intently
gazing
as
if
it
fascinated
her
on
the
far
stretch
of
grim
brown
waste
all
round
the
rain
dripping
and
drizzling
and
the
poor
tired
horses
patiently
splashing
on
through
the
mud
now
and
then
encouraged
by
the
queer
outlandish
cries
of
the
driver
at
last
the
girl
glanced
round
at
her
companions
both
fast
asleep
there
was
nothing
else
to
do
so
she
again
betook
herself
to
the
window
and
yielded
to
the
gloomy
fascination
of
the
moor
and
the
rain
it
began
at
last
to
seem
that
her
whole
life
had
been
spent
thus
that
everything
else
was
a
dream
and
the
only
realities
were
the
great
trackless
desert
and
the
diligence
rumbling
on
for
ever
where
to
and
where
from
she
seemed
neither
to
know
nor
care
then
i
suppose
she
must
have
fallen
into
a
doze
or
perhaps
asleep
outright
however
this
was
she
must
have
shut
her
eyes
for
some
time
for
when
she
next
was
conscious
of
using
them
all
was
changed
still
the
moor
all
round
but
no
longer
brown
and
grim
it
now
appeared
a
field
of
lovely
shades
of
colour
for
far
away
at
the
horizon
the
beautiful
sun
was
setting
in
radiance
and
the
rain
had
all
cleared
away
except
a
few
laggard
drops
still
falling
softly
each
a
miniature
rainbow
as
it
came
marion
watched
till
the
sun
was
gone
then
the
golden
light
grew
softer
and
paler
the
clouds
melted
from
crimson
and
rose
to
the
faintest
blush
and
at
last
all
merged
in
a
silvery
greyness
which
in
its
turn
gradually
deepened
again
to
the
dark
even
blue
of
a
cloudless
night
and
one
by
one
the
stars
came
out
each
in
its
accustomed
place
all
the
old
friends
whom
marion
had
first
learnt
to
call
by
name
from
the
windows
of
the
little
cottage
at
brackley
somehow
the
strangeness
and
the
loneliness
seemed
to
leave
her
as
she
saw
them
and
a
feeling
of
tranquil
happiness
stole
over
her
but
this
solitary
evening
in
the
old
diligence
was
never
forgotten
for
it
became
to
her
one
of
those
milestones
in
life
little
noticed
in
passing
but
plainly
seen
on
looking
back
soon
a
rattle
on
the
stop
y
and
lights
of
another
kind
from
those
overhead
told
the
travellers
that
their
wearisome
journey
was
ended
at
last
cissy
woke
up
brisk
as
ever
for
whatever
weak
points
archer
may
have
had
she
was
certainly
strong
that
of
being
an
agreeable
travelling
companion
it
is
a
trite
saying
that
there
is
no
trial
of
temper
equal
to
that
afforded
by
being
shut
up
together
for
weeks
in
a
ship
or
for
days
in
a
railway
but
both
of
these
tests
amiability
had
stood
triumphantly
now
rubbing
her
eyes
as
she
sat
up
and
looked
about
her
she
exclaimed
brightly
we
are
i
declare
and
now
we
shall
soon
be
able
to
put
this
poor
little
fellow
to
bed
comfortably
glancing
at
still
sleeping
charlie
then
in
the
sudden
inconsequent
manner
peculiar
to
very
impulsive
people
added
hastily
do
you
know
it
has
just
this
instant
struck
me
that
i
quite
forgot
to
answer
lady
letter
how
very
stupid
and
careless
of
me
i
shall
have
to
go
to
see
her
to
explain
about
as
she
spoke
they
drove
into
a
covered
courtway
the
diligence
drew
up
at
last
with
a
squeak
and
a
grunt
as
if
it
sympathised
with
the
tired
cramped
travellers
it
had
brought
so
far
a
jabber
outside
and
the
conducteur
jerked
open
the
door
enquiring
if
madame
archère
were
the
name
of
de
ces
archer
repeated
cissy
certainly
by
all
means
now
charlie
my
boy
wake
up
and
so
alighting
from
their
coupé
they
found
that
the
very
obliging
bailey
had
sent
a
and
carriage
to
convey
them
to
their
apartement
at
the
other
end
of
the
queer
rambling
little
town
it
was
not
so
very
late
after
all
though
past
poor
bedtime
when
they
found
themselves
installed
in
the
pretty
little
suite
of
rooms
which
for
several
months
to
come
they
were
to
consider
the
first
thing
to
be
done
of
course
was
to
get
the
small
gentleman
of
the
party
safely
disposed
of
for
the
night
he
pronounced
himself
too
sleepy
to
want
any
supper
but
brightened
up
in
the
most
aggravating
manner
at
the
sight
of
pretty
thérèse
poulin
already
prepared
to
commence
her
new
duties
as
his
personal
attendant
miss
mounseer
said
he
deliberately
seating
himself
on
a
stool
and
staring
lap
in
her
face
me
what
your
name
to
which
on
interpretation
the
girl
replied
smilingly
mon
cher
petit
monsieur
thérèse
repeated
he
meditatively
very
well
then
trays
let
you
undress
me
if
always
let
me
spread
my
bread
delighted
at
the
promising
aspect
of
the
new
nursery
arrangements
cissy
and
marion
made
their
escape
to
the
little
where
madame
poulin
a
cheery
active
old
body
had
providently
prepared
tea
à
anglais
as
she
phrased
it
for
their
refreshment
happening
to
ask
as
she
left
the
room
if
the
ladies
had
any
messages
they
would
like
executed
that
evening
any
letters
to
be
posted
for
instance
a
thought
struck
cissy
and
she
enquired
if
the
were
near
at
hand
to
which
madame
poulin
replied
briskly
that
it
was
in
the
very
next
street
just
round
the
corner
then
said
archer
send
some
one
to
ask
if
there
are
any
letters
lying
there
for
me
for
she
added
turning
to
marion
is
quite
possible
there
may
be
as
i
gave
no
address
but
poste
restante
and
all
yours
will
come
under
cover
to
me
as
we
agreed
would
be
five
minutes
later
thérèse
entered
the
room
with
two
letters
for
madame
which
had
been
waiting
her
arrival
since
the
day
before
tearing
one
open
an
enclosure
fell
out
addressed
to
miss
vere
who
seized
it
eagerly
harry
i
see
said
archer
a
model
brother
to
write
so
quickly
but
marion
did
not
respond
with
her
usual
brightness
to
her
remark
for
before
opening
the
envelope
a
misgiving
came
over
her
that
its
contents
would
not
be
of
a
cheerful
nature
nor
alas
were
they
poor
harry
wrote
in
sore
trouble
it
appeared
that
the
money
lender
the
little
jew
of
the
story
had
begun
to
have
fears
about
obtaining
from
cuthbert
the
sum
he
declared
to
be
owing
to
him
the
very
day
harry
had
seen
his
sister
in
london
the
man
had
stopped
cuthbert
in
the
street
and
had
loudly
threatened
him
with
exposure
unless
the
money
were
speedily
forthcoming
the
distress
and
anxiety
all
this
was
causing
his
friend
harry
very
naturally
felt
must
be
put
a
stop
to
and
he
wrote
to
say
that
he
only
waited
for
reply
in
the
faint
hope
that
some
idea
might
have
struck
her
before
making
up
his
mind
to
risk
all
and
boldly
apply
to
his
father
marion
shuddered
at
the
bare
thought
she
was
tired
too
and
by
her
several
travelling
cissy
was
engrossed
by
her
own
letter
and
did
not
for
a
moment
or
two
notice
poor
face
of
despondency
and
distress
suddenly
looking
up
to
tell
some
little
piece
of
news
in
which
her
young
cousin
might
take
interest
she
was
startled
by
the
expression
my
dear
child
whatever
is
the
matter
have
you
had
news
from
home
enquired
she
anxiously
no
answered
marion
least
not
exactly
nothing
but
what
i
knew
but
the
ice
once
broken
the
impulse
to
confide
her
trouble
to
kind
sympathising
cissy
was
too
strong
to
be
resisted
and
in
another
minute
archer
was
in
possession
of
all
the
facts
of
the
case
she
listened
attentively
only
interrupting
marion
by
little
soft
murmurs
of
pity
for
her
anxiety
and
when
she
had
heard
the
whole
she
agreed
with
her
cousin
that
it
certainly
would
be
very
awful
to
have
to
apply
to
vere
only
she
see
what
else
was
to
be
only
i
could
possibly
spare
the
money
she
said
you
know
i
thinking
of
that
interrupted
marion
know
you
are
rather
short
of
money
yourself
just
i
am
said
cissy
dolefully
now
may
dear
you
must
go
to
bed
and
try
to
sleep
i
promise
you
cudgel
my
brains
well
and
see
by
if
we
can
not
somehow
or
other
help
poor
harry
out
of
his
with
which
rather
vague
consolation
marion
for
the
present
had
to
be
satisfied
and
with
an
affectionate
night
the
cousins
separated

the
next
morning
was
bright
and
sunny
marion
woke
early
feeling
thanks
to
her
eighteen
years
perfectly
rested
and
refreshed
under
these
circumstances
too
as
might
be
expected
her
spirits
were
considerably
better
than
they
had
been
the
previous
night
when
she
cried
herself
to
sleep
in
her
fatigue
and
distress
she
lay
quietly
for
a
few
minutes
hazily
glancing
round
at
the
quaint
little
room
exquisitely
clean
and
fresh
certainly
for
madame
poulin
was
a
model
housewife
but
looking
somewhat
bare
to
thoroughly
english
eyes
still
the
very
strangeness
was
pleasant
and
the
sunshine
pouring
in
through
the
uncurtained
window
was
bright
enough
to
fill
even
this
plain
little
room
with
light
and
beauty
feeling
buoyant
and
cheerful
marion
sprang
up
and
was
nearly
dressed
when
a
small
tap
at
the
door
and
the
request
i
tum
in
announced
the
presence
of
master
charlie
his
tidings
were
not
of
the
cheeriest
mamma
was
very
tired
and
get
up
and
may
was
not
to
wait
it
was
really
not
to
be
wondered
at
for
cissy
was
by
no
means
a
robust
person
though
fortunate
in
the
possession
of
a
most
cheerful
disposition
and
a
wonderful
amount
of
energy
and
spirit
notwithstanding
however
all
the
good
will
in
the
world
she
was
now
forced
to
confess
herself
on
the
point
of
being
very
thoroughly
knocked
up
so
marion
breakfasted
alone
but
for
the
remembrance
of
letter
she
would
have
felt
very
bright
and
happy
this
first
morning
at
altes
the
weather
was
exquisitely
beautiful
from
the
little
terrace
on
to
which
opened
most
of
their
rooms
there
was
a
lovely
view
of
the
mountains
standing
out
sharp
and
clear
against
the
intense
perfect
blue
of
the
sky
what
a
colour
how
utterly
indescribable
to
those
who
have
never
chanced
to
see
it
how
different
from
the
bluest
of
our
northern
skies
is
this
rich
intensity
of
azure
in
the
reaction
of
the
present
clay
against
exaggeration
of
sentiment
or
language
it
has
i
know
become
the
fashion
to
disbelieve
and
decry
many
that
used
to
be
undoubtingly
accepted
still
as
all
reactions
do
this
one
has
gone
too
far
and
a
spirit
of
cynical
scepticism
is
fast
undermining
much
of
the
pleasure
people
certainly
a
very
small
minority
used
to
derive
from
the
descriptions
of
their
more
fortunate
neighbours
people
are
told
that
it
is
all
humbug
and
nonsense
about
southern
skies
having
a
richness
and
depth
of
colour
unknown
in
those
of
the
north
that
the
mediterranean
is
just
like
any
other
sea
and
the
tints
of
its
waters
not
one
whit
more
varied
or
brilliant
than
may
be
seen
at
any
english
coast
on
a
sunny
day
doubtless
the
north
has
its
own
peculiar
and
precious
beauties
and
well
and
fitting
it
is
that
its
children
should
appreciate
and
prize
them
but
why
therefore
set
ourselves
to
ignore
or
make
light
of
the
more
vivid
and
striking
loveliness
we
must
turn
southwards
to
see
for
my
part
i
can
only
tell
of
things
as
they
seemed
to
me
and
i
come
too
of
an
older
generation
one
in
which
people
were
not
ashamed
to
wonder
and
admire
heartily
and
even
enthusiastically
no
poor
words
of
mine
could
ever
in
the
faintest
degree
picture
the
marvellous
perfection
of
those
blue
skies
of
the
south
at
which
i
gazed
with
a
very
ecstasy
of
delight
or
of
the
waves
like
melted
emeralds
and
sapphires
lapping
softly
the
silvery
sparkling
sands
they
come
to
me
in
my
dreams
even
now
and
i
wake
with
a
vain
longing
to
hear
their
gentle
murmur
think
in
contrast
of
the
faint
sickly
hues
brought
before
us
by
our
english
words
assuredly
those
who
love
chiefly
beauty
in
colour
must
not
look
for
it
hereabouts
marion
stood
on
the
terrace
for
some
little
time
in
perfect
enjoyment
she
was
just
at
the
age
to
take
unalloyed
pleasure
in
the
loveliness
of
the
outer
world
it
woke
no
painful
remembrance
stirred
up
no
bitter
association
or
fruitless
longing
alas
alas
that
there
should
be
so
few
so
very
few
to
whom
in
later
years
the
beauty
of
this
beautiful
world
if
not
altogether
hidden
by
the
thick
veil
of
past
sorrows
is
truly
what
is
always
meant
be
a
delight
a
refreshment
joy
surely
it
is
more
or
less
in
our
or
power
keep
or
make
it
so
at
least
one
cheering
thought
might
be
drawn
from
it
by
even
the
most
weary
and
spirit
it
tells
us
that
we
and
our
sorrows
are
not
forgotten
for
there
before
us
in
every
leaf
and
blade
of
grass
the
universal
beauty
reveals
to
us
the
universal
love
but
a
girl
at
eighteen
does
not
stop
to
analyse
the
sensations
of
pleasure
aroused
by
a
beautiful
landscape
marion
only
thought
that
it
was
lovelier
than
anything
she
had
ever
imagined
and
well
worth
corning
so
far
to
see
she
was
fortunate
in
being
so
fresh
to
such
scenes
it
seems
to
me
most
mistaken
kindness
to
take
young
children
even
of
sights
they
become
familiar
with
beauty
of
these
noblest
kinds
long
before
it
is
in
the
least
possible
that
they
can
feel
or
appreciate
it
and
this
familiarity
ends
generally
in
utter
indifference
ignorance
in
short
that
there
is
anything
to
admire
not
that
children
should
be
brought
up
among
dinginess
and
ugliness
the
prettier
and
sweeter
their
surroundings
the
better
but
oh
parents
and
teachers
do
leave
the
little
creatures
simple
and
fresh
to
my
mind
a
child
of
ten
years
old
who
has
been
half
over
the
continent
and
chatters
pertly
of
switzerland
and
mont
blanc
naples
and
mount
vesuvius
is
more
to
be
pitied
than
we
children
of
long
ago
who
talked
to
each
other
with
bated
breath
of
these
wonders
we
should
see
we
grow
big
and
who
believed
implicitly
in
robinson
crusoe
and
the
swiss
family
if
not
in
liliputland
and
hassan
of
balsra
some
time
passed
and
then
marion
reluctantly
withdrew
from
the
terrace
and
the
little
salon
it
looked
quite
dark
from
the
contrast
with
the
flood
of
light
outside
and
as
the
eye
fell
on
her
little
which
she
had
set
on
the
table
intending
to
write
to
harry
it
seemed
as
if
the
darkness
had
entered
her
heart
too
can
i
say
to
him
thought
she
poor
cissy
ill
and
tired
i
even
talk
to
her
and
then
there
came
before
her
a
picture
of
harry
compelled
to
confess
all
to
his
father
a
terrible
scene
of
parental
reproaches
and
harshness
harry
cast
of
for
ever
perhaps
running
away
to
sea
and
his
life
utterly
separated
from
hers
and
from
all
happy
and
wholesome
influences
it
was
too
dreadful
to
think
of
very
foolish
and
exaggerated
no
doubt
still
such
things
have
been
then
too
there
was
great
excuse
for
anxiety
even
if
carried
too
far
harry
though
little
more
than
two
years
her
junior
had
been
almost
like
a
son
to
her
as
well
as
a
brother
she
was
naturally
stronger
in
character
than
he
and
also
much
more
thoughtful
and
considerate
and
then
to
a
gentle
unselfish
girl
it
comes
so
naturally
to
act
a
part
at
almost
any
age
i
think
as
i
write
of
a
tottering
nursemaid
of
six
or
seven
all
but
overwhelmed
by
the
baby
in
her
arms
at
first
glance
quite
as
big
as
herself
a
cold
day
and
the
clothing
of
both
babies
of
the
scantiest
of
course
the
small
nursemaid
has
a
tiny
shawl
small
nursemaids
always
have
her
charge
at
last
succumbs
to
cold
and
sets
up
a
dismal
howl
then
see
the
poor
little
woman
poor
baby
that
she
is
untaught
unkempt
uncared
for
with
what
sweetest
tenderness
she
soothes
the
crying
infant
seating
herself
with
infinite
pains
on
a
door
step
and
wrapping
round
the
other
the
poor
little
rag
of
a
shawl
which
was
the
only
protection
of
her
own
shivering
shoulders
dear
good
little
girl
unselfish
child
how
many
such
as
these
are
in
our
streets
ugly
dirty
little
creatures
we
shrink
from
them
as
we
pass
who
yet
are
already
fulfilling
nobly
in
utter
unconsciousness
their
part
of
work
as
dismal
imaginations
had
reached
their
height
she
was
again
interrupted
by
charlie
is
awake
and
wants
to
speak
to
you
was
his
message
which
marion
was
very
glad
to
hear
said
cissy
after
assuring
her
cousin
that
she
was
much
less
tired
now
and
would
be
quite
herself
by
the
afternoon
dear
do
you
know
been
thinking
ever
so
much
in
the
night
about
this
affair
of
think
me
hard
or
cruel
for
what
i
am
going
to
say
for
sure
i
mean
to
be
but
i
help
having
a
sort
of
feeling
that
perhaps
after
all
it
would
be
best
for
you
to
advise
harry
to
tell
all
to
your
father
though
he
is
stern
i
think
he
is
really
and
then
it
is
such
a
pity
for
a
boy
to
begin
any
concealment
from
his
father
you
think
so
yourself
dear
a
rule
certainly
i
do
said
marion
in
this
case
it
is
so
different
cissy
you
know
papa
it
is
not
the
harshness
at
the
time
that
i
so
dread
for
harry
though
that
would
be
bad
enough
it
is
the
thought
of
the
dreadfully
galling
way
he
would
be
treated
afterwards
papa
would
make
him
feel
that
he
had
utterly
lost
confidence
in
him
he
would
run
away
before
long
i
am
sure
and
think
what
might
become
of
him
no
cissy
i
advise
him
to
go
to
my
father
if
there
is
any
possible
way
of
avoiding
dear
i
suppose
you
know
best
replied
archer
thinking
it
over
last
night
it
seemed
to
come
before
me
that
it
would
be
right
for
harry
to
confess
his
fault
for
after
all
it
was
undoubtedly
his
own
fault
to
uncle
vere
and
take
his
reproaches
manfully
as
a
merited
punishment
not
that
i
do
not
feel
very
sorry
for
him
poor
fellow
for
after
all
it
was
a
mere
piece
of
boyish
folly
which
he
bitterly
repents
i
assure
you
said
marion
oh
cissy
you
think
of
any
plan
to
help
him
i
must
write
can
help
you
so
far
said
cissy
can
lend
you
the
money
for
two
or
three
months
you
see
we
are
sure
to
be
here
for
six
months
and
i
can
let
some
of
my
bills
the
rent
i
run
on
till
christmas
any
way
so
there
will
be
no
fear
of
our
running
short
i
only
wish
i
could
clear
poor
harry
of
this
horrible
debt
altogether
but
if
the
worst
comes
to
the
worst
i
can
write
to
george
and
he
will
only
think
i
have
been
rather
more
extravagant
than
you
certainly
shall
not
have
to
do
dear
cissy
exclaimed
her
cousin
than
that
i
would
face
papa
myself
and
risk
the
worst
he
could
say
or
do
to
me
for
he
should
never
know
it
had
been
debt
though
i
fear
he
would
suspect
it
but
if
you
can
really
lend
me
the
money
cissy
i
promise
you
i
shall
find
some
way
of
repaying
it
before
we
leave
altes
i
shall
not
tell
harry
how
i
have
got
it
as
he
would
be
dreadfully
hurt
at
my
having
told
you
and
still
more
ashamed
of
my
having
borrowed
it
in
this
way
so
remember
it
is
my
debt
and
not
his
and
if
i
pay
it
you
may
put
me
in
prison
he
added
gaily
so
great
her
relief
at
the
thought
of
safety
well
you
may
be
quite
sure
that
i
shall
do
so
replied
cissy
now
run
off
and
write
your
letter
i
will
give
you
three
ten
pound
notes
so
that
you
may
send
the
first
halves
of
them
gratefully
kissing
the
kind
little
woman
marion
obeyed
her
high
spirits
lasted
till
her
letter
was
written
and
with
its
precious
enclosure
carefully
posted
with
her
own
hands
then
as
she
walked
slowly
homewards
a
little
of
the
weight
returned
to
her
mind
how
was
she
now
to
repay
cissy
that
her
cousin
should
suffer
more
than
the
mere
temporary
inconvenience
of
having
advanced
the
money
she
was
determined
should
not
be
the
case
certainly
there
was
no
immediate
hurry
about
the
matter
but
marion
was
not
one
of
those
people
who
think
it
quite
time
enough
to
face
a
difficulty
when
it
is
close
at
hand
and
her
active
imagination
at
once
set
to
work
on
all
manner
of
possible
and
impossible
schemes
she
would
take
in
fine
needlework
and
get
up
at
unearthly
hours
to
do
it
without
knowledge
she
would
paint
same
exquisite
landscapes
that
would
be
sure
to
sell
on
reflection
however
she
saw
obstacles
in
the
way
of
executing
either
of
these
projects
she
was
not
in
the
first
place
remarkably
proficient
with
her
needle
nor
was
she
conceited
enough
to
think
that
her
water
colours
were
much
above
the
average
of
most
productions
of
the
kind
and
in
the
second
place
supposing
she
had
anything
to
sell
how
could
she
an
utter
stranger
in
a
foreign
town
find
a
purchaser
and
so
one
after
another
or
promising
looking
schemes
was
passed
in
review
and
rejected
by
her
common
sense
as
impracticable
still
on
the
whole
she
was
rather
amused
than
distressed
her
mind
at
ease
about
harry
all
other
considerations
seemed
trifling
there
was
even
something
exciting
and
exhilarating
about
the
novelty
of
the
idea
and
she
was
young
and
strong
and
to
such
the
grappling
with
a
difficulty
has
a
curious
charm
of
its
own
even
about
such
a
sordid
matter
as
the
making
or
earning
of
thirty
pounds
that
in
some
way
or
other
her
voluntary
promise
to
her
cousin
should
be
redeemed
she
was
determined
and
the
girl
was
not
one
to
undertake
what
she
would
not
fulfil
it
was
too
hot
to
leave
the
house
for
some
hours
after
noon
cissy
herself
on
a
sofa
in
the
coolest
earner
declaring
it
felt
something
like
india
and
then
suddenly
remembered
her
housewifely
responsibilities
rang
for
madame
poulin
and
entered
somewhat
vaguely
it
must
be
confessed
on
the
subject
of
dinners
all
however
was
charmingly
satisfactory
though
not
professing
to
do
much
cooking
herself
the
good
lady
assured
madame
all
could
be
agreeably
arranged
for
her
brother
was
the
head
of
the
best
hotel
in
altes
but
a
two
walk
beyond
the
and
would
supply
regularly
a
dinner
for
any
number
from
two
to
a
dozen
at
a
really
moderate
price
or
if
ces
dames
would
prefer
a
little
variety
now
and
then
there
was
the
table
at
this
same
hotel
every
day
at
five
where
the
choice
of
viands
would
be
greater
and
the
company
of
the
most
select
would
be
rather
amusing
now
and
then
for
a
observed
archer
marion
preferred
the
idea
of
a
private
repast
but
agreed
that
they
might
go
and
what
it
was
for
however
madame
poulin
was
requested
to
order
a
comfortable
little
dinner
in
their
own
quarters
and
after
some
further
conversation
on
the
subject
of
tastes
the
pleasant
old
lady
retired
leaving
behind
her
a
decidedly
favourable
impression
which
longer
acquaintance
only
confirmed
a
few
minutes
passed
in
silence
till
it
occurred
marion
that
it
would
be
as
well
for
her
to
write
her
father
announcing
their
safe
arrival
this
task
accomplished
and
cissy
declaring
she
was
too
tired
to
go
out
marion
settled
herself
in
a
snug
corner
by
the
window
with
an
interesting
book
which
she
had
read
half
of
on
the
journey
but
alas
for
her
pleasurable
intentions
hardly
had
she
opened
the
volume
when
an
interruption
appeared
in
the
person
of
charlie
in
a
state
of
tremendous
eagerness
to
write
a
letter
to
foster
the
poor
little
fellow
had
really
been
very
good
all
day
doing
his
best
to
get
on
pleasantly
with
thérèse
who
was
certainly
good
nature
itself
and
had
been
making
on
her
side
efforts
to
amuse
her
small
charge
and
to
understand
his
observations
still
as
she
was
us
wholly
innocent
of
english
as
the
child
of
french
it
was
rather
trying
work
for
both
marion
felt
that
charlie
deserved
some
reward
so
she
laid
down
her
book
and
established
him
on
her
knee
with
a
sheet
of
before
him
and
a
pencil
in
his
hand
the
nature
of
their
occupation
being
a
very
engrossing
one
marion
did
not
hear
the
sound
of
a
carriage
drawing
up
at
the
door
below
the
little
terrace
nor
did
she
pay
attention
to
the
slight
bustle
of
enquiries
made
and
answered
which
ensued
in
another
moment
however
the
door
of
the
room
opened
and
thérèse
ushered
in
a
visitor
whom
cissy
started
up
to
receive
marion
was
reluctant
to
disturb
charlie
and
being
almost
hidden
by
the
curtains
sat
still
quietly
observing
the
new
corner
who
cordially
greeting
archer
had
evidently
not
noticed
that
there
was
anyone
else
present
the
visitor
was
an
elderly
lady
tall
and
well
dressed
with
some
remains
of
former
beauty
of
a
pleasing
though
not
very
striking
kind
her
expression
was
gentle
but
somewhat
anxious
and
uneasy
which
was
soon
explained
by
her
announcing
herself
to
be
very
deaf
deaf
indeed
my
dear
she
repeated
to
archer
in
her
fussy
way
whereupon
poor
cissy
of
course
set
to
work
shouting
in
a
shrill
tone
of
all
others
the
most
impossible
for
a
deaf
person
to
catch
the
sound
of
after
one
or
two
trials
however
she
got
on
a
little
better
and
succeeded
in
explaining
to
lady
severn
as
marion
had
already
guessed
her
to
be
her
regret
at
having
failed
in
meeting
with
a
desirable
young
lady
as
governess
owing
to
the
delay
in
the
reaching
her
which
contained
her
request
lady
severn
was
evidently
disappointed
but
consoled
herself
by
entering
at
great
length
into
her
troubles
and
anxieties
with
respect
to
her
education
archer
listened
sympathisingly
as
was
her
wont
but
so
absorbed
was
the
elder
lady
by
her
own
recital
that
it
was
not
till
she
rose
to
go
that
she
remembered
to
make
enquiry
for
her
child
or
children
and
for
the
last
news
of
colonel
archer
the
satisfactory
state
of
her
health
having
been
communicated
cissy
suddenly
remembering
that
in
the
confusion
of
lady
unexpected
entrance
and
the
subsequent
discovery
of
her
deafness
she
had
not
introduced
her
young
cousin
turned
to
look
for
her
there
the
pair
was
still
seated
in
perfect
content
charlie
perched
on
knee
as
quiet
as
a
mouse
had
found
ample
amusement
in
peeping
from
behind
the
curtains
at
the
funny
old
lady
whom
mamma
was
shouting
to
but
now
at
a
sign
from
his
mother
he
slipped
down
and
ran
forward
to
be
kissed
and
admired
as
a
fine
little
fellow
and
like
his
papa
was
when
i
first
remember
him
said
lady
severn
adding
in
an
undertone
as
a
tear
glistened
in
her
eye
were
two
such
fine
boys
my
dear
your
husband
and
my
poor
john
and
he
left
no
son
to
succeed
him
you
know
only
the
two
little
girls
not
but
what
they
are
very
dear
creatures
but
i
help
wishing
there
had
been
a
boy
and
so
does
ralph
himself
for
that
matter
but
it
be
marion
listened
with
some
curiosity
to
these
allusions
to
the
family
history
she
had
already
heard
half
unconsciously
stepping
forward
into
the
room
lady
glance
at
last
fell
upon
her
and
cissy
hastened
to
apologise
and
explain
unfortunately
however
in
her
eagerness
to
introduce
her
pretty
guest
archer
pitched
her
voice
badly
and
the
result
was
that
the
old
lady
caught
no
words
of
the
sentence
but
the
two
last
vere
cissy
had
ended
with
freer
repeated
lady
severn
with
satisfaction
at
her
own
acuteness
freer
i
hope
you
will
like
altes
and
you
too
my
dear
little
are
some
lovely
walks
in
the
neighbourhood
which
i
do
not
think
miss
freer
will
consider
too
far
for
these
sturdy
little
ejaculated
cissy
cousin
miss
vere
again
repeated
lady
severn
with
perfect
satisfaction
yes
i
caught
the
name
thank
you
i
am
generally
rather
clever
at
catching
names
correctly
besides
it
is
familiar
to
me
it
is
the
name
of
our
surgeon
at
medhurst
perhaps
he
may
be
a
relation
of
yours
miss
freer
it
is
not
a
very
common
marion
replied
with
malicious
calmness
that
she
was
not
aware
that
she
had
any
relations
at
medhurst
but
by
this
time
cissy
was
beyond
attempting
further
explanations
she
controlled
herself
sufficiently
to
accompany
lady
severn
to
the
head
of
the
stairs
where
the
good
lady
favoured
her
with
some
further
remarks
still
more
distressing
to
her
gravity
on
the
subject
of
miss
freer
and
then
she
rushed
back
into
the
room
scarlet
with
suppressed
laughter
though
at
the
same
time
considerably
annoyed
how
could
you
she
exclaimed
there
in
that
demure
way
and
answering
that
you
had
no
relations
at
medhurst
do
you
know
that
the
old
goose
thought
you
were
my
companion
or
governess
i
am
not
sure
which
imagine
uncle
face
if
he
had
seen
it
she
told
me
as
she
said
goodbye
that
she
only
wished
she
could
meet
with
just
such
a
young
lady
for
her
two
dear
creatures
i
tried
to
explain
but
it
was
hopeless
really
you
might
have
helped
i
see
how
said
marion
you
have
had
me
confuse
the
poor
lady
still
more
by
shouting
my
name
into
her
one
ear
while
you
were
doing
the
same
into
the
other
and
she
was
so
pleased
at
her
own
cleverness
it
would
really
have
been
a
shame
to
undeceive
her
besides
she
went
on
more
seriously
truly
see
what
harm
it
does
me
for
lady
severn
or
anybody
else
to
take
me
for
a
governess
vex
yourself
about
it
cissy
it
really
does
matter
said
archer
almost
angrily
it
was
all
my
own
stupidity
too
in
not
introducing
you
properly
at
first
but
i
was
all
but
asleep
when
she
came
in
and
then
i
make
her
how
does
it
matter
asked
marion
gently
seeing
that
her
cousin
was
really
annoyed
a
hundred
ways
i
want
you
to
enjoy
your
visit
here
and
have
a
little
more
variety
than
in
your
dull
life
at
home
i
want
you
to
make
some
nice
acquaintances
and
to
be
admired
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
you
know
and
what
a
stupid
beginning
to
be
mistaken
by
our
only
acquaintance
for
a
governess
are
not
altogether
debarred
from
all
the
pleasant
things
you
name
are
they
said
marion
really
see
anything
dreadful
either
in
the
mistake
or
the
reality
had
it
existed
but
seriously
cissy
leave
off
thinking
about
it
this
incident
however
or
something
gave
marion
herself
ample
subject
for
reflection
for
she
was
unusually
thoughtful
and
silent
all
the
afternoon
in
the
course
of
the
evening
archer
received
a
note
from
bailey
apologising
for
not
having
already
called
to
see
her
and
expressing
hopes
that
when
she
had
got
over
the
fatigue
of
her
journey
and
miss
bailey
might
have
the
pleasure
of
making
her
acquaintance
must
be
a
civil
kindly
old
man
said
she
after
reading
it
i
exactly
see
the
necessity
of
a
friendship
with
madame
and
mademoiselle
i
wonder
how
they
know
anything
about
me
unless
they
call
in
a
sort
of
way
on
all
the
should
hardly
think
they
could
find
time
for
that
said
marion
perhaps
they
have
heard
about
you
from
some
yes
exclaimed
cissy
remember
lady
severn
said
she
had
got
my
address
from
the
baileys
really
marion
it
was
horribly
rude
of
me
not
to
answer
her
letter
i
suspect
it
was
her
eagerness
on
the
governess
question
that
brought
her
to
call
so
quickly
but
i
daresay
very
good
and
kind
indeed
i
know
she
is
for
george
says
she
was
almost
like
a
mother
to
him
long
ago
when
his
own
mother
was
in
severn
look
particularly
delicate
remarked
marion
they
always
spend
the
winter
abroad
dear
no
not
delicate
if
by
that
you
mean
a
consumption
or
anything
of
that
kind
i
daresay
she
is
not
remarkably
strong
and
then
she
is
no
longer
young
sir
death
aged
her
terribly
i
believe
but
it
is
principally
on
account
of
one
of
the
little
girls
that
they
have
spent
the
last
two
or
three
years
on
the
continent
the
younger
one
i
she
is
was
very
ill
soon
after
her
death
and
her
grandmother
thought
she
was
going
to
die
and
came
abroad
in
a
fright
the
all
right
again
now
but
i
suppose
lady
severn
is
over
anxious
and
fussy
i
fancy
too
she
dislikes
the
idea
of
returning
to
medhurst
for
it
was
there
her
son
help
thinking
said
marion
after
a
minute
or
silence
there
is
unnatural
in
lady
devotion
to
the
memory
of
the
one
son
and
apparent
indifference
to
the
other
even
what
she
said
about
regretting
that
sir
john
had
left
no
boy
struck
rue
as
a
curious
thing
to
say
considering
that
sir
ralph
is
her
own
son
unless
indeed
he
is
peculiarly
unlovable
or
has
in
some
way
or
other
forfeited
his
affection
by
his
own
fault
it
does
seem
queer
replied
cissy
still
from
what
i
have
heard
i
can
understand
it
in
a
sort
of
way
you
see
from
boyhood
john
severn
was
looked
upon
as
the
heir
and
ralph
was
so
different
quiet
and
grave
and
not
the
sort
of
character
to
be
much
noticed
in
any
way
whereas
sir
john
must
have
been
a
splendid
fellow
really
i
suppose
it
ever
occurred
to
any
one
that
ralph
could
become
the
head
of
the
house
but
if
you
are
interested
in
the
family
may
i
dare
say
you
will
have
opportunity
enough
while
here
to
study
their
various
is
the
other
child
called
know
or
if
i
ever
did
forgotten
girls
of
ten
and
twelve
interest
me
particularly
though
i
liked
you
may
when
you
were
a
little
girl
said
archer
affectionately
were
such
a
dear
shy
little
thing
and
you
had
such
funny
quaint
ways
i
never
can
believe
you
are
the
same
you
seemed
to
me
to
become
all
in
a
minute
with
my
never
seeing
you
all
these
years
after
toy
marriage
i
kept
fancying
in
that
silly
way
that
i
should
come
home
and
find
you
just
as
i
left
you
think
me
very
childish
now
do
you
asked
marion
rather
anxiously
i
look
much
younger
than
i
am
do
you
think
cissy
has
put
that
in
your
head
all
of
a
sudden
said
archer
laughing
thought
you
were
far
too
wise
ever
to
think
about
outward
looks
at
all
the
very
thing
about
you
that
is
so
unlike
most
girls
you
are
such
an
indescribable
mixture
of
extreme
girlishness
and
preternatural
wisdom
you
look
such
a
perfect
child
sometimes
at
the
very
moment
that
i
am
shaking
in
my
shoes
before
you
and
your
dreadfully
good
advice
you
certainly
would
make
a
capital
governess
marion
if
you
kept
your
pupils
in
as
good
order
as
poor
me
only
you
are
fa
too
pretty
all
the
big
brothers
and
would
fail
in
love
with
you
to
a
cissy
please
joke
in
that
sort
of
way
i
want
to
ask
you
seriously
do
you
really
think
i
should
make
a
good
governess
course
you
would
i
believe
you
might
make
a
good
anything
you
chose
you
are
certainly
clever
enough
to
manage
me
in
a
way
that
fills
me
with
amazement
and
admiration
but
do
think
of
something
more
interesting
than
governesses
thank
goodness
no
fear
of
your
ever
having
to
be
there
well
i
know
stranger
things
happen
every
day
why
papa
might
loose
all
his
money
and
i
might
have
to
earn
my
bread
like
a
model
young
lady
in
a
story
might
undoubtedly
but
also
you
might
not
answered
her
cousin
carelessly
and
then
changing
the
subject
she
continued
should
you
say
to
our
dining
at
the
table
it
be
rather
amusing
you
like
replied
marion
it
would
be
pleasanter
if
we
knew
anyone
likely
to
be
there
you
say
you
knew
another
family
there
yes
the
berwicks
i
must
look
them
up
i
suppose
for
they
are
old
friends
and
they
know
here
but
getting
sleepy
marion
are
you
ready
to
say
good
night
i
hope
you
mind
breakfasting
alone
again
for
i
want
to
be
quite
rested
by
afternoon
so
that
we
may
go
a
walk
or
a
drive
afraid
it
has
been
very
stupid
for
you
it
would
be
much
more
stupid
if
you
were
to
get
ill
cissy
dear
said
marion
rest
by
all
means
i
shall
have
breakfast
early
and
perhaps
go
out
a
little
walk
on
my
own
account
with
charlie
and
thérèse
before
you
are
as
she
spoke
her
eye
fell
on
a
lying
on
the
table
it
was
that
of
lady
severn
which
thérèse
being
rather
untaught
in
such
matters
had
followed
instead
of
preceding
her
into
the
room
marion
took
it
up
and
looked
at
it
closely
in
the
corner
was
written
the
temporary
address
des
lauriers
no
a
trifle
but
it
decided
a
good
deal
that
i
know
the
address
thought
the
girl
can
go
there
in
the
morning
before
cissy
is
chapter
iv
a
friend
in
need
fickle
love
you
grow
for
some
and
grip
them
to
their
grief
as
sudden
as
the
redwings
come
at
the
full
fall
of
the
leaf
sudden
as
the
swallows
go
that
muster
for
the
sea
you
pass
away
before
we
know
and
wounded
hearts
are
des
lauriers
no
last
thought
in
her
head
at
night
first
when
she
woke
in
the
morning
in
her
dreams
too
the
words
had
been
constantly
before
her
fear
of
my
forgetting
the
address
said
marion
to
herself
breakfast
over
she
arranged
with
thérèse
and
charlie
to
accompany
them
in
their
morning
walk
about
twelve
and
then
she
fidgeted
about
unable
to
settle
to
anything
rather
frightened
if
the
truth
must
be
told
at
the
thought
of
what
she
was
about
to
do
it
is
a
crisis
in
our
lives
when
for
the
first
time
we
take
what
we
believe
to
be
an
important
step
entirely
on
our
own
responsibility
well
for
us
when
this
crisis
does
not
occur
too
soon
well
too
when
it
is
not
deferred
too
late
of
the
two
extremes
doubtless
the
latter
is
the
more
to
be
dreaded
better
some
sad
tumbles
and
bruises
better
indeed
a
broken
limb
than
the
hopeless
feebleness
of
members
stunted
if
not
paralysed
for
want
of
natural
use
experience
is
truly
a
hard
schoolmaster
but
we
have
not
yet
found
a
better
one
some
day
we
must
be
or
else
be
utterly
wrecked
and
stranded
so
if
for
no
higher
motive
than
mere
prudence
and
expediency
it
is
well
not
to
delay
too
long
the
testing
of
our
own
powers
the
trial
of
our
individual
strength
cissy
had
said
truly
that
marion
was
a
curious
mixture
of
simplicity
and
wisdom
child
and
woman
i
wonder
if
in
this
lay
her
peculiar
charm
but
this
indeed
i
can
not
tell
the
charm
i
have
felt
deeply
too
but
like
other
sweet
and
beautiful
things
i
endeavoured
in
vain
to
analyse
or
define
it
the
girl
tried
to
read
or
write
or
work
but
all
her
attempts
were
useless
like
a
naughty
schoolboy
who
has
resolution
enough
to
plan
it
truant
expedition
but
fails
to
conceal
his
excitement
beforehand
so
marion
was
on
the
point
a
dozen
times
that
morning
of
betraying
her
strange
intention
had
cissy
not
been
tired
and
sleepy
when
marion
peeped
in
to
wish
her
good
morning
she
would
infallibly
have
detected
some
unusual
signs
of
excitement
in
her
young
manner
a
word
from
her
and
the
whole
would
have
been
in
her
possession
and
then
life
might
have
been
more
happily
and
this
story
of
it
would
in
all
probability
never
have
been
written
however
it
was
not
so
to
be
twelve
came
at
last
and
with
her
little
cavalier
and
thérèse
as
escort
marion
sallied
forth
the
rue
des
lauriers
she
learnt
from
thérèse
was
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
only
from
the
street
in
which
mme
house
was
situated
anxious
that
walk
should
not
be
curtailed
on
her
account
and
perhaps
not
sorry
in
her
secret
heart
to
delay
if
only
for
the
task
she
had
set
herself
marion
proposed
that
they
should
in
the
first
place
take
a
stroll
beyond
the
town
the
day
was
much
cooler
than
the
preceding
one
indeed
it
was
cloudy
enough
to
suggest
the
possibility
of
not
far
distant
rain
beautiful
mountains
were
all
but
hidden
in
mist
and
it
was
difficult
to
believe
in
the
blue
sky
of
yesterday
still
there
were
now
and
then
breaks
in
the
mist
and
clouds
showing
that
the
loveliness
was
veiled
only
not
destroyed
remarks
apropos
of
everything
from
the
bills
to
the
sisters
of
charity
with
their
enormous
flapping
caps
were
amusing
enough
but
marion
was
too
engrossed
by
her
own
thoughts
to
listen
with
her
usual
attention
as
they
reached
the
end
of
rue
des
a
slight
drizzle
began
to
fall
and
marion
told
thérèse
to
hasten
home
with
charlie
as
she
herself
had
a
call
to
make
some
little
way
up
the
street
your
mamma
charlie
she
cried
as
they
separated
she
wants
me
that
i
shall
be
home
in
a
very
little
no
was
at
the
other
extremity
of
the
street
avenue
almost
it
might
have
been
called
for
it
was
prettily
planted
with
trees
at
each
side
and
the
gardens
of
the
houses
standing
many
of
them
detached
or
in
villa
fashion
were
bright
and
well
kept
those
at
the
upper
end
were
evidently
of
older
date
no
especially
had
a
somewhat
venerable
air
it
was
built
round
three
sides
of
a
court
laid
out
with
turf
and
in
the
centre
of
which
a
little
fountain
was
playing
lazily
a
damp
drizzling
day
however
is
hardly
the
occasion
on
which
such
a
place
is
seen
to
advantage
and
marion
decided
mentally
that
she
would
have
been
sorry
to
exchange
the
little
terrace
on
to
which
rooms
opened
for
the
quaint
old
however
picturesque
she
rang
bravely
at
what
appeared
to
be
the
principal
door
which
to
her
surprise
was
opened
by
an
old
woman
who
informed
her
that
the
apartment
of
miladi
severn
was
on
the
other
side
au
premier
the
entrance
opposite
was
open
so
marion
ascended
a
flight
of
stairs
and
rang
again
at
the
first
door
that
presented
itself
this
time
she
felt
sure
she
was
right
for
a
in
attire
appeared
in
answer
to
her
summons
in
reply
to
her
enquiry
as
to
whether
she
could
see
lady
severn
on
a
matter
of
business
he
said
that
he
would
ask
and
ushered
her
into
a
very
pretty
sitting
room
opening
to
her
surprise
on
to
a
pleasant
garden
the
mystery
as
to
how
she
found
herself
again
on
the
ground
floor
without
having
descended
any
steps
was
explained
when
she
remembered
that
the
rue
des
lauriers
was
built
on
a
steep
hill
at
the
upper
extremity
of
which
stood
no
how
it
came
to
be
number
five
instead
number
one
was
a
problem
never
satisfactorily
solved
marion
waited
a
few
minutes
and
then
the
servant
to
say
that
lady
severn
would
be
ready
to
see
the
young
lady
almost
immediately
if
she
would
be
so
good
as
to
give
her
name
here
was
a
poser
marion
could
not
yet
bring
herself
to
say
but
a
lucky
compromise
occurred
to
her
have
no
card
with
me
she
said
lady
severn
will
know
who
i
am
if
you
say
i
have
come
from
the
name
apparently
was
all
required
for
in
another
moment
lady
severn
entered
the
room
she
came
in
looking
rather
puzzled
but
shook
hands
kindly
enough
with
marion
saying
as
she
did
so
that
she
hoped
archer
was
not
feeling
ill
or
that
anything
was
wrong
with
little
charlie
dear
no
thank
you
said
marion
are
both
very
well
at
least
my
archer
is
only
a
little
tired
still
from
the
long
journey
i
should
have
remembered
that
you
would
be
surprised
at
my
calling
so
early
but
i
trust
you
excuse
my
having
done
so
the
truth
is
i
called
on
my
own
account
not
on
lady
severn
looking
still
more
puzzled
when
a
bright
idea
suddenly
striking
her
she
exclaimed
perhaps
you
have
some
friend
miss
freer
who
you
think
might
suit
me
as
governess
for
my
little
girls
a
sister
possibly
she
continued
for
the
expression
of
the
face
did
not
seem
to
contradict
her
assumption
profiting
by
dire
experience
of
the
day
before
marion
took
care
to
speak
in
a
natural
regular
tone
which
she
was
pleased
to
find
her
companion
heard
perfectly
probably
her
voice
was
rounder
and
fuller
than
but
however
this
may
have
been
the
result
was
eminently
satisfactory
and
very
possibly
still
further
prepossessed
lady
severn
in
her
favour
exactly
that
she
replied
have
no
sister
but
what
i
have
to
propose
is
myself
as
governess
to
your
my
dear
miss
freer
exclaimed
lady
severn
in
amazement
how
can
that
be
are
you
not
engaged
already
to
archer
i
supposed
that
you
had
accompanied
her
from
england
and
excuse
me
miss
freer
but
i
should
think
on
no
account
of
interfering
with
any
arrangements
archer
may
be
depending
upon
even
though
you
may
not
consider
yourself
exactly
bound
to
her
you
must
not
mind
my
speaking
plainly
miss
freer
young
people
and
you
look
very
young
are
not
always
as
considerate
in
these
matters
as
they
should
in
spite
of
herself
marion
felt
a
little
indignant
this
was
the
first
slight
taste
of
the
disagreeables
and
annoyances
a
and
less
girl
would
have
called
them
to
which
by
the
strange
and
almost
unprecedented
steps
she
had
taken
she
had
exposed
herself
what
is
commonly
called
dependent
position
whose
are
the
independent
positions
i
have
not
yet
in
the
course
of
is
long
life
been
able
to
discover
i
suppose
peculiar
trials
of
its
own
yet
i
am
anxious
in
the
present
case
not
to
be
misunderstood
as
exaggerating
or
laying
undue
stress
upon
those
attendant
upon
governess
life
much
harm
has
been
dome
already
in
this
way
and
were
i
desirous
of
entering
at
all
upon
the
subject
i
would
much
prefer
to
draw
attention
to
the
bright
side
of
the
picture
side
which
i
am
happy
to
say
my
own
personal
experience
call
vouch
for
us
existing
it
is
a
false
position
which
is
to
be
dreaded
and
which
is
in
the
evil
sense
of
the
word
a
dependent
one
marion
seldom
if
ever
blushed
but
now
when
this
speech
of
lady
roused
her
indignation
she
felt
the
strange
tingling
sensation
through
all
her
veins
which
agitation
of
any
kind
produced
upon
her
calm
and
as
she
appeared
she
replied
quietly
i
were
capable
of
behaving
in
any
dishonourable
way
to
archer
i
should
not
think
myself
fit
to
be
entrusted
with
the
care
of
your
lady
severn
but
i
assure
you
there
is
no
such
objection
to
my
proposal
i
only
came
from
england
with
archer
as
a
friend
we
are
indeed
very
old
friends
i
should
not
think
of
leaving
her
for
more
than
a
part
of
the
day
what
i
was
going
to
propose
was
that
i
should
be
the
little
daily
governess
i
should
say
for
i
should
require
to
spend
all
my
afternoons
with
i
see
replied
lady
severn
must
pardon
my
not
having
quite
understood
the
state
of
the
case
at
first
what
i
wished
however
was
to
meet
with
a
residential
governess
for
the
young
ladies
my
marion
winced
again
but
pulled
herself
up
in
a
moment
thought
she
must
sound
rather
free
and
easy
my
speaking
these
children
whom
i
have
never
seen
as
the
little
so
she
answered
demurely
understood
that
a
residential
governess
was
what
you
wished
for
the
young
ladies
but
my
idea
was
that
in
the
meantime
while
you
have
not
succeeded
in
meeting
with
one
i
might
at
least
be
able
to
employ
the
morning
hours
profitably
i
think
any
rate
i
could
kelp
them
from
forgetting
what
knowledge
they
have
already
certainly
replied
lady
severn
graciously
have
no
doubt
you
could
do
far
more
than
that
and
i
really
think
your
idea
a
very
good
one
i
should
however
like
to
consult
with
my
niece
miss
vyse
before
deciding
anything
she
takes
a
great
interest
in
her
little
cousins
and
is
herself
most
highly
accomplished
and
as
to
terms
miss
freer
have
you
thought
what
you
would
wish
to
have
as
compensation
for
your
morning
hours
wince
number
three
silly
i
am
thought
marion
and
answered
abruptly
pounds
i
mean
she
added
hastily
i
were
staying
at
altes
six
months
and
i
taught
the
young
ladies
all
that
time
would
fifteen
pounds
a
quarter
be
too
much
something
in
the
wistfulness
of
the
sweet
face
appealing
to
her
so
timidly
and
yet
so
anxiously
touched
a
chord
in
the
not
unkindly
though
somewhat
nature
of
the
eider
lady
and
she
exclaimed
impulsively
pounds
a
quarter
too
much
my
dear
no
certainly
not
i
should
much
prefer
making
it
twenty
but
my
dear
you
are
so
very
young
are
you
sure
this
is
a
wise
step
for
your
own
sake
would
not
your
friends
prefer
your
making
a
real
holiday
of
this
little
time
abroad
with
archer
friends
are
not
likely
to
interfere
said
the
girl
adding
sadly
have
no
how
much
those
few
words
left
to
be
inferred
they
came
very
close
home
to
lady
heart
mother
a
sad
little
picture
as
far
as
possible
removed
from
the
truth
but
none
the
less
touching
on
that
account
rose
before
her
eye
of
this
motherless
probable
home
but
though
somewhat
curious
to
hear
more
she
made
no
enquiry
which
for
aught
she
knew
might
have
touched
some
tender
spot
she
only
said
very
gently
child
and
then
went
on
more
briskly
then
so
far
there
appears
no
difficulty
the
sum
i
named
would
quite
satisfy
you
miss
freer
twenty
pounds
each
repeated
marion
would
be
forty
pounds
in
six
months
oh
no
thank
you
i
would
much
rather
have
only
fifteen
truly
i
want
more
she
added
earnestly
my
dear
do
you
know
you
will
never
get
on
in
the
world
if
you
are
so
reverse
of
grasping
remonstrated
the
old
lady
half
laughing
at
this
very
eccentric
young
governess
friends
even
if
they
do
not
interfere
with
you
in
general
would
certainly
disapprove
of
your
not
taking
as
high
a
salary
as
is
offered
you
and
which
indeed
from
what
i
see
of
you
i
feel
sure
you
would
do
your
best
to
deserve
besides
i
should
look
to
you
for
a
good
deal
my
they
were
no
longer
the
young
ladies
several
masters
for
music
drawing
german
and
so
on
but
i
should
wish
you
to
superintend
their
preparations
for
their
masters
as
much
at
least
as
you
found
time
for
besides
yourself
directing
their
english
studies
you
would
feel
able
to
undertake
all
this
i
suppose
yes
said
marion
think
i
could
do
all
that
would
be
required
by
girls
of
their
ages
i
can
play
pretty
well
i
believe
she
said
with
a
pretty
little
air
of
any
appearance
of
least
i
was
well
taught
i
draw
much
but
i
could
help
them
to
prepare
for
their
master
and
i
have
studied
german
a
good
deal
and
italian
a
you
sing
too
asked
lady
severn
should
do
so
and
well
to
judge
by
your
voice
in
speaking
which
is
peculiarly
clear
indeed
it
is
very
seldom
i
can
hear
anyone
as
easily
as
you
i
should
like
the
children
to
sing
a
little
now
and
then
not
much
of
course
not
so
as
to
strain
their
voices
while
they
are
so
young
but
i
should
like
them
to
learn
a
little
some
of
the
simpler
parts
of
glees
for
instance
their
uncle
sir
ralph
severn
is
very
fond
of
music
and
has
a
remarkably
fine
voice
we
often
have
little
concerts
among
ourselves
in
the
evenings
and
it
would
be
nice
for
charlotte
and
sybil
to
be
able
to
join
in
do
sing
said
marion
very
much
though
but
i
could
teach
them
in
the
simple
way
you
wish
i
am
this
terrible
money
appears
the
only
obstacle
said
lady
severn
smiling
my
dear
you
must
really
think
what
your
friends
would
assure
you
replied
marion
am
quite
free
to
judge
for
myself
indeed
when
i
came
to
altes
i
had
no
intention
of
making
any
money
in
this
way
it
was
only
hearing
of
your
difficulty
in
meeting
with
a
governess
it
struck
me
i
might
do
temporarily
for
i
was
very
anxious
to
make
thirty
pounds
while
here
not
more
truly
my
friends
could
not
object
for
it
she
went
on
hesitatingly
feeling
she
was
getting
on
unsafe
ground
was
for
one
of
them
the
nearest
of
them
that
i
so
much
wanted
the
money
at
well
then
said
lady
severn
well
as
you
wish
it
we
will
leave
it
so
at
present
adding
to
herself
you
shall
be
no
loser
by
it
in
the
end
poor
child
and
then
aloud
you
will
call
here
at
the
same
time
i
will
give
you
my
decision
and
introduce
your
pupils
to
you
as
to
references
there
need
be
no
delay
fortunate
that
lady
severn
was
thus
easily
satisfied
for
references
hail
never
entered
poor
head
your
being
a
friend
of
is
quite
enough
and
at
your
age
you
can
not
have
had
much
former
experience
of
replied
marion
never
taught
anyone
regularly
thought
so
but
i
do
not
regret
it
the
children
will
probably
be
all
the
happier
with
you
than
if
you
had
been
older
and
more
experienced
and
for
so
short
a
time
it
will
be
no
so
with
a
cordial
good
morning
from
lady
severn
and
a
kindly
message
or
remembrance
to
archer
marion
took
her
departure
with
a
curious
mixture
of
feelings
in
her
heart
she
slowly
descended
the
flight
of
stairs
to
the
courtyard
so
wholly
absorbed
in
her
own
cogitations
that
she
all
but
ran
against
a
gentleman
just
entering
the
doorway
whose
attention
on
his
side
was
engrossed
by
the
endeavouring
to
shut
a
rather
obstreperous
umbrella
a
hasty
and
he
passed
her
quickly
running
up
the
stair
she
noticed
only
that
he
was
slight
and
dark
and
that
he
had
on
a
very
wet
in
those
days
when
but
recently
invented
not
the
pleasantest
of
attire
unless
one
had
a
special
predilection
for
the
odour
of
tar
and
melted
combined
can
anyone
wear
those
horrible
coats
said
marion
to
herself
but
very
speedily
she
was
forced
to
confess
that
she
would
not
be
sorry
were
she
to
find
herself
magically
enveloped
in
such
a
garment
for
it
was
pouring
literally
pouring
with
rain
no
longer
drizzle
but
good
honest
most
unmistakable
rain
and
of
course
with
her
head
full
of
blue
sky
and
brilliant
sunshine
as
the
normal
condition
of
weather
at
altes
she
had
brought
no
umbrella
there
she
stood
rather
despondently
staring
at
the
fountain
which
seemed
to
her
in
a
much
brisker
mood
than
when
she
had
observed
it
on
entering
as
far
as
she
herself
was
concerned
marion
really
was
by
no
means
afraid
of
a
wetting
but
then
she
knew
the
sight
of
her
with
drenched
garments
would
seriously
annoy
cissy
whom
at
this
present
time
she
was
most
especially
anxious
to
conciliate
she
thought
of
turning
back
and
borrowing
au
umbrella
from
lady
severn
but
she
felt
rather
averse
to
doing
so
and
had
just
made
up
her
mind
to
brave
it
when
a
voice
behind
her
made
her
start
mademoiselle
it
said
parait
que
vous
pas
de
parapluie
et
il
pleut
à
verse
permettez
moi
de
vous
ofrir
le
the
french
was
perfectly
correct
the
accent
irreproachable
but
yet
a
certain
something
an
undefinable
instinct
caused
marion
to
hesitate
in
her
reply
as
she
turned
towards
the
speaker
she
stopped
in
the
vous
she
had
all
but
uttered
and
for
it
substituted
a
hearty
you
as
her
glance
fell
on
the
gentleman
who
had
a
few
minutes
before
passed
her
on
his
way
in
you
she
repeated
are
very
kind
he
said
with
she
fancied
a
slight
expression
of
amusement
on
his
quiet
grave
face
accent
still
betrays
me
i
see
but
i
am
not
sorry
it
is
so
in
the
present
ease
as
nothing
is
more
ridiculous
than
forsaking
native
tongue
unnecessarily
i
think
he
added
umbrella
is
a
one
and
will
protect
you
pretty
well
opening
it
he
spoke
this
was
more
easily
managed
than
the
shutting
had
been
and
with
repeated
thanks
marion
had
turned
to
go
when
suddenly
recollecting
that
she
was
in
ignorance
of
the
name
and
address
of
the
owner
of
the
umbrella
she
stopped
and
asked
if
she
should
return
it
to
number
five
if
you
please
he
replied
live
here
you
will
see
my
name
on
the
handle
but
do
not
trouble
about
sending
it
back
at
once
any
time
in
the
next
few
days
will
do
i
believe
i
have
another
somewhere
and
indeed
i
much
prefer
being
without
one
these
charming
coats
are
much
better
things
he
added
regarding
his
attire
with
supreme
satisfaction
they
may
be
to
the
wearer
but
assuredly
not
becoming
said
marion
to
herself
as
she
crossed
the
courtyard
under
the
shelter
of
the
friendly
umbrella
do
think
it
was
very
kind
of
him
though
to
lend
me
this
so
i
should
not
laugh
at
his
queer
appearance
in
that
hideous
coat
i
wonder
what
his
name
by
this
time
she
was
in
the
street
and
stopped
for
a
moment
to
decipher
the
letters
on
the
handle
funny
thought
she
my
introductions
to
this
family
are
rather
peculiar
how
amused
cissy
will
be
but
with
the
thought
of
cissy
came
hack
rather
uneasy
sensations
satisfaction
at
the
success
of
her
visit
to
lady
severn
had
for
the
moment
caused
her
to
forget
the
still
more
awful
business
before
her
the
confessing
all
to
cissy
and
extorting
from
her
a
promise
of
without
which
her
scheme
must
infallibly
fail
the
part
of
the
whole
which
she
least
liked
to
think
of
was
the
being
known
under
a
false
name
and
yet
this
very
mistake
of
lady
had
been
one
of
the
strongest
inducements
to
her
to
offer
herself
as
governess
to
these
children
for
as
miss
vere
she
felt
that
she
could
not
have
ventured
on
so
bold
and
unusual
a
proceeding
now
however
that
the
rubicon
was
passed
it
appeared
to
her
that
the
turning
back
would
entail
greater
annoyances
and
mortification
on
both
herself
and
her
cousin
than
they
could
possibly
be
exposed
to
by
perseverance
in
her
intention
this
she
hoped
to
be
able
to
demonstrate
to
cissy
and
thus
to
induce
her
to
refrain
from
opposition
but
the
more
she
thought
of
it
the
more
she
dreaded
the
coming
interview
no
use
however
in
delaying
it
she
had
hardly
made
up
her
mind
as
to
how
she
should
enter
upon
the
awful
disclosure
when
she
found
herself
at
their
own
door
which
was
standing
open
cissy
anxiously
looking
out
for
her
marion
she
exclaimed
very
naughty
you
are
to
stay
out
it
the
rain
i
have
been
in
such
a
fuss
about
cissy
replied
the
delinquent
very
naughty
you
are
to
stand
at
the
door
catching
cold
be
impertinent
miss
but
come
in
and
take
off
your
wet
things
and
then
tell
me
what
you
have
been
about
oh
i
see
you
had
an
umbrella
what
a
great
big
one
is
that
your
own
one
i
got
the
loan
of
it
said
marion
hastily
closing
the
conspicuous
umbrella
before
cissy
had
time
to
observe
it
more
particularly
into
the
cissy
and
be
with
you
in
five
minutes
and
tell
you
all
my
adventures
in
the
the
five
minutes
had
hardy
elapsed
when
marion
rejoined
her
cousin
the
damp
day
had
rendered
a
tiny
fire
acceptable
cissy
was
seated
near
it
and
marion
knelt
down
on
the
rug
before
her
looking
up
into
her
face
with
a
curious
expression
on
her
own
is
the
matter
may
have
you
really
any
adventures
to
tell
me
asked
archer
replied
the
girl
quietly
least
i
have
a
confession
to
make
to
you
what
do
you
think
i
have
done
cissy
do
i
think
you
have
done
how
can
i
think
till
i
know
frighten
me
may
tell
me
quickly
what
you
then
i
will
tell
you
quickly
cissy
what
i
have
done
is
this
i
have
engaged
myself
as
daily
governess
to
lady
for
three
months
certainly
and
if
possible
for
said
cissy
excitedly
are
joking
you
mean
that
you
have
really
done
such
a
mad
thing
you
marion
vere
a
daily
governess
you
uncle
daughter
no
nonsense
you
be
in
cissy
i
am
thoroughly
and
entirely
in
earnest
it
came
into
my
mind
yesterday
when
lady
severn
mistook
me
for
governess
i
saw
before
me
a
simple
easy
way
of
making
the
money
i
required
to
pay
back
poor
debt
and
i
determined
to
carry
out
my
scheme
without
telling
you
of
it
till
it
was
and
then
she
gave
her
cousin
a
full
account
of
her
interview
with
lady
severn
and
the
arrangements
proposed
and
without
giving
cissy
time
to
make
any
remarks
or
to
urge
any
objections
she
went
on
to
show
her
how
easily
and
naturally
the
thing
might
be
managed
without
ever
being
in
their
secret
how
lady
mistaking
her
name
and
the
fact
of
her
being
a
perfect
stranger
in
altes
would
effectually
prevent
her
identity
with
the
daughter
of
the
vere
ever
being
suspected
after
all
she
continued
is
such
a
very
thrilling
thing
i
shall
only
be
away
for
a
few
hours
in
the
morning
and
often
indeed
shall
be
home
almost
before
you
are
dressed
the
work
itself
such
as
it
is
will
be
exceedingly
good
for
me
in
every
way
i
am
really
looking
forward
to
it
with
the
greatest
is
not
that
part
of
it
i
am
thinking
of
so
much
said
cissy
gravely
is
the
disadvantage
it
may
be
to
you
in
a
hundred
indirect
ways
which
you
are
too
childish
to
think
of
even
supposing
as
may
be
the
case
that
the
truth
is
never
suspected
there
is
something
very
anomalous
and
undesirable
about
the
whole
affair
especially
the
being
known
under
a
name
that
is
not
yours
fancy
in
after
life
if
it
came
out
in
the
queer
way
that
things
do
that
you
had
spent
six
mouths
abroad
under
an
assumed
name
you
must
own
marion
that
it
is
enough
to
startle
me
to
think
of
what
you
may
be
exposing
yourself
to
and
to
think
it
is
all
for
the
sake
of
that
wretched
money
as
if
i
would
not
twenty
times
rather
have
lent
you
six
times
as
much
whether
you
ever
repaid
it
or
cissy
you
and
that
settles
the
matter
you
have
lent
it
and
i
certainly
have
borrowed
it
without
repaying
it
properly
the
choice
lay
between
my
doing
what
i
have
done
or
applying
to
papa
and
rather
than
go
to
him
for
it
i
really
think
i
would
be
a
governess
all
my
life
besides
she
added
that
so
much
is
done
can
it
be
undone
it
seems
to
me
the
attempting
to
undo
it
would
entail
all
manner
of
disagreeable
things
explanations
of
private
matters
to
lady
severn
a
perfect
stranger
to
me
and
personally
hardly
better
known
to
you
one
thing
i
am
quite
sure
of
and
that
is
that
she
would
not
forgive
the
part
i
have
acted
in
the
matter
indeed
i
myself
should
feel
dreadfully
small
as
far
as
my
chances
of
enjoying
my
visit
to
altes
are
concerned
which
you
dear
cissy
think
so
much
of
i
assure
you
i
am
more
likely
to
do
so
as
miss
freer
lady
daily
governess
than
as
marion
vere
i
get
over
the
mortification
at
having
appeared
so
cunning
if
i
really
earn
the
money
i
shall
feel
that
i
am
working
for
harry
and
somehow
that
prevents
my
feeling
as
if
i
were
deceitful
or
and
the
more
they
talked
it
over
the
more
awkward
appeared
the
complication
or
at
least
marion
talked
cissy
into
thinking
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
go
on
with
the
plan
indeed
said
marion
by
way
of
triumphantly
summing
up
her
argument
am
under
promise
to
lady
severn
to
undertake
the
post
if
she
thinks
me
suitable
and
i
go
back
from
a
so
tired
of
discussion
and
rather
bewildered
by
eloquence
poor
cissy
gave
in
sorely
against
her
will
really
will
be
great
fun
putting
every
thing
else
aside
said
marion
cissy
you
must
never
call
me
cousin
or
fortunately
we
have
no
english
servants
with
us
and
charlie
always
calls
me
may
then
all
my
letters
which
be
many
come
under
cover
to
you
it
will
all
answer
am
sorry
i
join
you
in
seeing
anything
beautiful
about
the
whole
affair
from
beginning
to
end
said
cissy
but
having
given
in
i
must
not
be
cross
about
it
i
know
you
did
it
from
the
best
of
motives
but
all
the
same
it
was
fearfully
rash
i
believe
leaving
off
raining
she
added
as
a
sudden
gleam
of
sunshine
entered
the
room
reminds
me
may
where
did
you
borrow
that
great
umbrella
did
lady
severn
lend
it
you
replied
marion
and
then
not
sorry
to
distract
her
thoughts
she
related
her
little
adventure
said
archer
must
certainly
have
been
sir
ralph
but
feel
flattered
by
his
civility
marion
at
this
moment
i
have
no
doubt
he
has
not
the
slightest
idea
if
the
person
he
lent
it
to
was
an
ugly
old
woman
or
a
pretty
young
girl
very
probably
he
would
have
lent
it
all
the
more
heartily
had
you
been
the
likely
said
marion
laughing
appearance
evidently
does
not
trouble
him
and
then
as
it
had
really
cleared
up
wonderfully
they
set
of
for
a
walk
cissy
said
marion
bailey
is
coming
this
afternoon
replied
archer
had
not
forgotten
it
but
marion
if
i
give
in
to
this
mad
scheme
of
yours
you
must
instruct
me
what
i
am
to
do
must
i
introduce
you
on
all
occasions
in
this
new
character
of
yours
will
very
seldom
be
any
necessity
for
introducing
me
at
all
you
can
speak
of
me
and
to
me
as
you
always
do
which
will
seem
quite
natural
i
told
lady
severn
we
were
very
old
friends
and
that
i
had
just
come
abroad
with
you
for
the
pleasure
of
the
well
said
cissy
shall
hear
me
introduce
you
to
bailey
as
a
deserving
young
person
whom
i
have
a
very
good
opinion
but
this
introduction
proved
to
be
unnecessary
bailey
had
hardly
sat
down
before
he
remarked
to
archer
how
pleased
he
was
to
hear
that
her
young
friend
had
undertaken
temporarily
the
charge
of
the
studies
of
the
little
misses
severn
excellent
arrangement
he
pronounced
it
new
pupils
miss
freer
he
had
heard
the
name
even
charming
children
the
younger
one
especially
is
a
great
friend
of
mine
she
has
been
far
from
strong
poor
child
but
is
now
much
better
i
should
not
however
advise
her
being
pressed
forward
in
her
lessons
time
enough
for
that
time
and
so
he
chattered
on
in
a
kindly
uninteresting
way
told
archer
the
names
of
the
principal
families
english
french
russians
and
germans
who
intended
this
year
wintering
at
altes
advised
her
by
all
means
occasionally
to
dine
at
the
table
of
the
as
the
variety
would
be
good
for
her
and
the
cooking
excellent
and
then
took
his
leave
with
the
promise
of
a
speedy
visit
from
the
ladies
of
his
household
chapter
au
lion
feast
was
also
provided
for
our
reception
at
which
we
sat
cheerfully
down
and
what
the
conversation
wanted
in
wit
was
made
up
in
vicar
of
wakefield
have
no
objection
to
dining
at
the
table
note
today
have
you
marion
asked
cissy
when
bailey
had
taken
his
departure
dear
no
said
marion
am
perfectly
willing
to
go
if
you
so
when
the
dinner
hour
drew
near
the
two
sallied
forth
to
the
they
were
ushered
into
a
room
where
a
long
table
stood
prepared
for
a
considerable
number
of
guests
of
whom
however
only
a
few
had
as
yet
made
their
appearance
as
strangers
archer
and
marion
found
themselves
placed
at
the
lower
end
the
younger
seat
being
at
the
corner
at
the
right
of
what
in
a
private
house
would
have
been
the
chair
commanded
an
excellent
view
of
the
whole
table
the
persons
already
assembled
did
not
strike
marion
as
in
any
way
interesting
there
were
several
english
mostly
elderly
and
in
the
extreme
a
rather
stout
german
lady
with
a
very
stupid
though
not
daughter
and
a
couple
of
awkward
sons
just
as
cissy
had
in
a
low
voice
confided
to
her
cousin
that
in
future
she
thought
it
would
be
nicer
to
dine
at
home
the
door
opened
to
admit
several
other
guests
a
little
group
of
three
persons
seating
themselves
on
the
vacant
chairs
beside
archer
immediately
attracted
that
observant
attention
they
were
evidently
father
mother
and
child
the
last
a
nice
little
girl
of
fourteen
or
thereabouts
the
mother
still
young
and
was
decidedly
prepossessing
in
appearance
and
her
devoted
attention
to
her
husband
evidently
the
invalid
of
the
party
touched
a
wifely
chord
in
affectionate
little
heart
fraser
for
so
her
neighbours
soon
discovered
that
she
was
named
happened
to
sit
next
to
archer
and
but
a
few
minutes
elapsed
before
the
two
somewhat
congenial
spirits
were
in
friendly
conversation
marion
by
her
position
at
the
table
slightly
separated
from
them
felt
herself
at
liberty
to
sit
silent
and
amuse
herself
by
observing
her
companions
of
these
the
liveliest
and
most
conspicuous
were
some
six
or
seven
gentlemen
who
had
entered
the
room
immediately
after
the
fraser
family
they
came
in
together
talking
and
laughing
though
not
noisily
and
evidently
belonging
to
one
party
marion
soon
gathered
from
their
conversation
that
some
excursion
was
in
question
preliminary
to
which
they
had
all
met
to
dine
at
the
she
found
them
an
amusing
study
as
from
time
to
time
she
glanced
at
them
demurely
in
the
little
group
of
six
or
seven
young
men
several
nations
were
represented
first
came
john
bull
in
the
shape
of
a
good
natured
substantial
rather
handsome
man
apparently
about
thirty
years
of
age
then
a
lively
energetic
little
frenchman
brisk
and
amusing
but
with
something
unquestionably
refined
about
him
too
next
to
him
sat
an
exceedingly
conceited
young
man
fair
and
with
good
features
of
which
the
most
striking
was
exaggeratedly
roman
nose
the
nationality
of
this
individual
somewhat
puzzled
miss
vere
as
did
also
that
of
his
immediate
neighbour
on
the
left
a
very
young
man
a
boy
almost
whose
handsome
face
and
thoroughbred
air
rendered
him
the
most
attractive
of
the
party
he
and
his
friend
soon
proved
themselves
to
be
famous
linguists
for
in
the
course
of
less
than
half
an
hour
marion
heard
them
speak
english
french
german
and
a
word
or
two
incidentally
of
italian
each
so
far
as
her
ear
could
discover
with
perfect
ease
and
fluency
the
rest
of
the
party
consisted
of
a
young
man
an
english
officer
home
from
india
and
a
half
individual
and
stiff
whom
marion
decided
and
rightly
to
be
the
tutor
of
the
handsome
cosmopolitan
snatches
only
of
their
conversation
reached
her
but
enough
to
amuse
and
interest
her
the
whole
party
was
full
of
the
anticipated
enjoyment
of
the
mountain
expedition
as
far
as
she
could
gather
they
intended
starting
that
evening
driving
a
considerable
distance
and
ascending
to
a
certain
point
in
time
to
see
the
sun
rise
that
i
care
much
about
seeing
the
sun
rise
said
the
heavy
englishman
shivering
at
the
thought
i
daresay
it
will
give
us
good
appetite
for
which
think
you
my
friend
to
mount
still
higher
asked
the
frenchman
will
you
that
while
you
repose
we
then
ascend
in
this
case
can
we
again
find
you
as
we
mean
to
say
de
interrupted
the
young
officer
you
ever
dreamt
of
getting
to
the
top
by
all
means
leave
him
half
way
we
should
certainly
have
to
carry
him
the
best
part
of
the
way
up
and
no
light
weight
said
the
substantial
chepstow
no
reason
why
i
get
to
the
the
slightest
my
dear
sir
why
you
should
not
both
get
to
the
top
and
stay
there
if
you
find
it
agreeable
observed
the
gentleman
with
what
seemed
to
marion
a
rather
impertinent
sneer
in
his
tone
chepstow
however
being
one
of
those
happily
people
to
whom
the
possibility
that
they
are
being
made
fun
of
never
occurs
commenced
a
ponderous
speech
to
the
effect
that
his
friend
had
misunderstood
him
in
supposing
that
he
had
any
wish
to
settle
for
life
on
the
summit
of
the
noir
which
speech
unfortunately
was
destined
never
to
be
concluded
for
the
person
to
whom
it
was
addressed
taking
not
the
slightest
notice
of
it
turned
to
his
neighbour
on
the
other
side
handsome
boy
as
marion
had
mentally
dubbed
him
saying
is
it
my
dear
she
could
not
catch
the
name
hero
has
then
disappointed
you
we
are
not
to
be
honoured
with
his
company
after
all
ah
what
a
loss
think
only
how
we
might
all
have
profited
by
hours
in
the
company
of
so
learned
an
individual
you
especially
chepstow
he
added
turning
sharply
to
that
gentleman
hardly
yet
recovered
from
the
surprise
of
finding
himself
not
listened
to
so
fast
erbenfeld
replied
the
younger
man
still
hope
for
my
company
price
met
him
this
afternoon
and
at
that
time
he
spoke
of
joining
us
did
he
not
price
he
enquired
of
the
gentleman
he
did
answered
the
person
addressed
but
just
then
the
little
frenchman
broke
in
with
a
vivacious
description
of
something
or
other
and
marion
lost
the
thread
of
the
conversation
all
this
time
cissy
had
been
chattering
busily
to
her
new
acquaintances
but
though
from
the
position
or
her
seat
she
had
not
so
good
a
view
as
her
cousin
of
the
party
of
young
men
it
must
not
be
thought
that
they
had
escaped
her
observation
far
from
it
she
had
been
making
good
use
of
her
time
by
extracting
from
her
lively
and
communicative
companion
quite
a
fund
of
information
respecting
the
little
world
of
altes
society
before
the
end
of
dinner
she
was
perfectly
informed
respecting
the
names
rank
antecedents
and
expectations
of
the
several
gentlemen
composing
the
group
at
the
other
end
of
the
table
and
now
with
a
smile
of
satisfaction
she
whispered
to
marion
that
she
had
lots
to
tell
her
when
they
got
home
poor
cissy
i
am
afraid
it
must
be
admitted
that
she
was
something
of
a
gossip
but
after
all
if
no
one
ever
said
worse
of
their
neighbours
than
she
did
the
world
at
large
would
be
in
a
considerably
more
amicable
state
of
mind
than
it
is
at
present
half
way
through
the
meal
there
was
a
new
arrival
a
gentleman
who
came
in
quietly
and
made
his
way
to
the
head
or
the
room
where
the
party
of
young
men
was
seated
and
before
taking
his
place
said
a
few
words
in
a
low
voice
to
chepstow
of
apology
for
his
tardiness
marion
fancied
thereby
confirming
her
guess
that
the
substantial
englishman
was
in
the
present
instance
the
entertainer
of
the
others
the
appearance
of
the
seemed
to
affect
the
members
of
the
group
variously
chepstow
shook
hands
with
him
in
a
hearty
hospitable
way
that
would
have
seemed
more
in
place
in
an
english
than
at
a
french
table
erbenfeld
greeted
him
with
the
slightest
possible
approach
to
a
bow
which
however
he
could
not
succeed
in
rendering
haughty
or
dignified
as
he
evidently
intended
the
frenchman
was
airily
cordial
and
the
young
officer
looked
sulky
and
rather
disgusted
as
if
he
thought
the
jollity
of
the
party
had
received
its
but
over
the
thin
careworn
face
of
price
there
crept
an
expression
of
pleasure
touching
to
see
and
the
handsome
boy
his
pupil
started
up
with
a
bright
smile
of
welcome
which
made
marion
think
of
her
own
harry
at
home
the
face
had
not
yet
been
fully
turned
in
her
direction
but
the
sound
of
his
voice
was
slightly
familiar
that
voice
had
he
known
it
was
his
strong
point
not
too
deep
though
round
and
mellow
in
no
wise
weak
though
it
could
be
gentle
as
a
firm
and
penetrating
without
a
shade
of
hardness
and
above
all
it
was
a
voice
that
rang
true
when
at
last
he
sat
down
and
marion
saw
him
distinctly
the
familiarity
of
the
voice
was
explained
it
was
the
hero
of
the
umbrella
as
he
glanced
round
the
table
she
half
fancied
that
his
eye
for
a
second
rested
upon
her
with
the
slightest
possible
expression
of
recognition
but
very
probably
this
was
only
a
trick
of
her
imagination
she
was
glad
when
he
entered
into
an
evidently
interesting
conversation
with
price
and
his
pupil
as
he
then
turned
slightly
aside
and
she
ventured
now
and
again
to
glance
at
him
no
cissy
was
right
he
was
most
certainly
not
handsome
and
yet
not
exactly
either
a
certain
quiet
gravity
of
expression
attracted
her
she
knew
him
to
be
an
unusually
clever
man
but
had
she
not
known
this
from
hearsay
she
fancied
she
would
have
discovered
it
for
herself
the
brow
was
good
the
eyes
too
deeply
set
for
beauty
the
nose
passable
the
mouth
but
with
lines
about
it
that
would
have
made
it
hard
had
it
not
been
for
a
gentler
expression
half
of
humour
half
of
melancholy
which
went
and
came
now
brightening
now
saddening
but
always
softening
all
the
features
of
the
dark
quiet
face
knowing
as
she
aid
nothing
of
his
history
and
character
it
seemed
to
marion
that
it
would
not
be
difficult
to
understand
this
man
if
not
to
like
him
at
least
to
respect
and
be
interested
by
him
i
think
it
was
what
she
had
heard
of
his
somewhat
isolated
and
solitary
life
that
inclined
her
to
feel
already
a
sort
of
regard
pity
almost
for
him
her
life
had
not
been
so
bright
and
full
but
that
she
had
some
knowledge
of
lonely
hours
and
lonelier
feelings
how
easily
she
could
picture
him
to
herself
as
a
boy
shy
and
backward
beside
his
more
brilliant
brother
how
well
she
could
enter
into
the
little
understood
suffering
carelessly
alluded
to
in
those
few
words
of
his
when
expressing
her
wish
that
sir
john
had
left
an
heir
so
does
ralph
himself
wish
for
that
marion
sat
dreaming
thus
to
herself
and
half
started
when
a
question
from
cissy
as
to
what
in
the
world
she
was
thinking
of
drew
her
into
conversation
with
her
cousin
and
fraser
dinner
was
about
over
and
in
a
few
minutes
the
whole
party
dispersed
archer
greatly
delighted
by
request
that
she
might
call
to
see
her
the
next
day
is
really
a
very
nice
little
woman
she
may
said
archer
as
they
were
walking
home
fraser
i
the
first
place
my
dear
cissy
she
is
at
least
half
a
head
taller
than
you
as
for
her
niceness
i
much
opportunity
of
judging
she
was
so
busy
talking
to
you
she
is
certainly
very
and
i
like
her
face
poor
man
but
how
dreadfully
ill
he
looks
there
a
chance
of
his
living
long
said
cissy
briskly
was
that
part
of
his
very
entertaining
communications
enquired
marion
drily
for
shame
of
course
not
i
could
see
it
for
myself
in
half
a
minute
you
do
take
one
up
so
for
whatever
one
says
exclaimed
archer
indignantly
i
was
going
to
tell
you
all
i
heard
about
the
people
here
fraser
knows
the
berwicks
slightly
that
is
to
say
at
least
she
knows
the
ladies
of
the
family
and
the
old
major
that
sunburnt
young
man
among
those
gentlemen
at
the
head
of
the
table
was
the
son
young
berwick
captain
i
think
he
is
now
he
is
home
on
leave
for
two
years
i
never
saw
him
before
but
george
knows
him
a
little
i
think
fraser
says
rather
nice
by
all
accounts
berwick
and
the
eldest
daughter
blanche
are
rather
stupid
blanche
always
ill
and
the
mother
fussing
about
her
the
younger
daughter
sophy
is
and
lively
but
is
allowed
to
run
rather
wild
i
fancy
she
had
a
great
flirtation
with
that
fair
young
man
with
the
queer
nose
erbenfeld
is
his
name
a
swede
but
he
found
out
in
time
that
she
had
no
money
all
this
happened
last
year
and
so
it
came
to
cissy
your
new
friend
must
be
a
regular
at
all
marion
you
understand
said
archer
with
a
slight
shade
of
annoyance
in
her
tone
i
am
very
glad
to
have
got
to
know
something
of
all
these
people
in
this
sort
of
way
there
was
no
harm
whatever
in
fraser
giving
me
a
little
information
about
them
she
saw
i
was
a
perfect
stranger
in
the
place
and
i
told
her
i
should
like
to
know
something
about
the
society
here
perhaps
it
was
a
little
rash
of
us
both
but
i
know
that
she
is
a
nice
person
i
felt
it
instinctively
and
perhaps
she
felt
the
same
towards
me
her
husband
was
laughing
at
her
a
little
for
gossiping
but
he
said
she
made
a
point
of
collecting
all
the
stories
she
could
to
amuse
him
with
for
often
he
leave
his
room
for
days
together
but
if
you
would
rather
not
listen
to
my
marion
sure
you
hesitate
to
say
cissy
i
was
only
teasing
you
well
what
more
about
erbenfeld
erbenfeld
oh
not
much
to
tell
about
him
a
sort
of
adventurer
i
should
say
he
has
spent
the
two
last
winters
here
on
pretence
of
his
health
but
really
they
say
because
he
hopes
to
pick
up
a
rich
english
wife
he
is
rather
at
visits
all
the
best
people
here
being
fairly
and
gentlemanlike
but
fraser
says
he
is
a
good
deal
laughed
at
on
account
of
the
airs
he
gives
himself
about
his
old
family
and
grand
relations
in
though
he
was
very
rude
indeed
to
chepstow
remarked
marion
yes
the
stout
big
man
how
did
you
hear
his
name
heard
that
erbenfeld
mention
it
he
pronounced
it
but
what
can
a
man
like
chepstow
be
doing
here
i
am
sure
he
does
not
look
as
though
he
were
an
my
dear
child
do
get
it
out
of
your
head
that
everyone
at
altes
is
an
invalid
it
is
quite
a
mistake
at
least
half
the
people
here
simply
come
for
amusement
chepstow
as
it
happens
is
here
to
recruit
his
spirits
for
his
wife
died
a
few
months
ago
and
he
found
his
home
so
miserable
without
her
that
he
bear
to
spend
the
winter
there
an
enormously
rich
man
fraser
you
notice
the
gentleman
who
came
in
when
dinner
was
half
over
asked
marion
particularly
i
think
fraser
knew
least
she
made
no
observations
about
should
have
him
though
said
marion
why
exclaimed
cissy
now
i
think
of
it
his
face
did
strike
me
as
familiar
in
a
sort
of
misty
way
i
know
she
went
on
eagerly
i
know
now
it
was
sir
ralph
i
supposed
said
marion
it
was
certainly
the
gentleman
who
lent
me
the
umbrella
this
stupid
of
me
not
to
recognize
him
said
cissy
i
might
just
as
well
say
how
stupid
of
him
not
to
recognize
me
he
is
a
good
deal
changed
naturally
for
it
is
seven
years
since
i
saw
him
at
cairo
and
then
only
for
a
few
hours
he
is
more
but
even
graver
than
he
was
then
but
what
a
handsome
young
man
that
russian
was
you
think
so
marion
i
liked
his
face
exceedingly
she
replied
that
explains
his
speaking
so
many
being
a
russian
i
mean
what
is
his
name
vladimir
nodouroff
or
some
name
like
that
answered
archer
family
comes
here
every
winter
he
has
a
beautiful
sister
that
man
was
his
tutor
the
little
name
is
monsieur
de
fraser
knows
him
a
little
and
says
he
is
charming
they
are
all
setting
off
on
a
mountain
excursion
i
heard
them
alluding
to
it
said
marion
after
all
cissy
your
sir
ralph
be
such
a
very
unsociable
never
said
he
was
answered
cissy
only
said
he
was
much
less
popular
than
his
brother
indeed
i
know
very
little
about
him
but
those
learned
people
are
always
and
disagreeable
but
oh
may
how
i
hate
this
governessing
scheme
of
yours
fraser
asked
me
if
you
were
my
sister
and
when
i
said
i
as
nearly
as
possible
added
that
you
were
my
cissy
what
did
you
say
i
saw
you
looking
at
me
rather
said
you
were
a
great
friend
of
mine
and
that
not
being
particularly
wanted
at
home
i
had
persuaded
your
friends
to
let
you
come
abroad
with
me
thinking
it
was
as
well
to
get
accustomed
to
my
rôle
in
this
farce
i
went
on
to
say
that
rather
against
my
wishes
you
had
determined
on
accepting
a
situation
as
daily
governess
while
at
altes
rather
than
be
idle
fraser
said
girl
well
if
she
has
to
do
it
the
sooner
she
begins
the
better
i
felt
such
a
hypocrite
marion
i
managed
to
avoid
naming
you
though
i
really
have
called
you
miss
you
will
have
to
do
so
sooner
or
later
cissy
though
i
confess
the
part
i
least
like
of
the
affair
myself
did
you
bear
anything
of
the
bailey
family
from
fraser
she
says
they
are
plain
good
sort
of
people
the
mother
is
gentle
and
amiable
and
the
daughter
takes
after
her
fraser
was
here
all
last
winter
too
she
says
there
are
excellent
subscription
balls
they
are
kept
very
select
indeed
you
can
only
get
tickets
by
giving
your
name
to
one
of
the
committee
major
berwick
is
on
it
so
there
will
be
no
difficulty
for
us
if
we
feel
inclined
to
go
somehow
i
think
i
shall
like
the
berwicks
much
fraser
was
cautious
in
her
way
of
speaking
about
them
but
i
gathered
that
old
berwick
is
rather
a
though
she
professes
to
live
quite
out
or
the
world
on
account
poor
blanche
at
school
i
remember
she
promised
to
be
a
very
pretty
girl
but
she
was
always
an
hour
or
so
later
as
marion
and
cissy
sat
quietly
reading
and
working
they
heard
the
sound
of
several
carriage
wheels
passing
quickly
strolling
on
to
the
terrace
they
caught
sight
of
the
party
of
gentlemen
setting
off
on
their
expedition
it
was
a
lovely
evening
after
the
rain
the
moon
just
appearing
as
the
daylight
began
to
fade
the
young
voices
sounded
cheerfully
as
they
drove
past
just
below
the
terrace
i
envy
them
said
cissy
you
marion
think
how
delightful
it
would
be
to
drive
ever
so
far
in
the
moonlight
replied
marion
with
a
sigh
it
would
be
very
and
as
she
spoke
a
sort
of
childish
discontent
with
her
quiet
humdrum
life
came
over
her
she
wished
that
she
was
very
rich
and
very
beautiful
and
free
to
enjoy
some
of
the
many
pleasant
things
that
there
are
in
the
world
and
then
her
mood
gradually
altered
a
feeling
stole
over
her
that
a
change
was
impending
what
or
how
she
could
not
have
put
in
words
a
vague
presentiment
that
she
had
reached
the
boundary
of
her
simple
unruffled
and
that
womanhood
with
its
deeper
fuller
also
alas
its
profounder
sorrows
and
gnawing
before
her
a
voice
seemed
to
warn
her
to
ask
her
not
to
be
in
haste
to
leave
the
careless
peaceful
present
for
the
unknown
untried
future
but
he
answered
in
her
heart
defiantly
am
not
afraid
to
meet
my
fate
to
take
my
place
in
the
battle
the
sooner
the
better
i
am
strong
and
ready
to
do
my
part
and
bear
my
mead
of
suffering
only
give
me
my
share
of
life
let
me
feel
what
it
is
to
poor
child
poor
little
bird
eager
to
try
its
wings
little
knowing
how
tossed
and
torn
how
very
weary
they
would
be
before
they
were
again
folded
in
rest
but
thank
heaven
there
are
many
bright
days
in
young
lives
and
of
some
of
these
we
must
tell
chapter
vi
florence
every
pleasing
every
prudent
part
say
what
can
chloe
want
wants
a
pope
five
minutes
after
marion
had
left
lady
that
rainy
morning
another
young
lady
entered
it
a
tall
handsome
girl
beautiful
almost
at
least
to
those
who
define
beauty
as
material
perfection
of
form
and
colour
not
troubling
themselves
too
much
about
the
nature
of
the
soul
within
that
in
appearance
she
was
what
is
called
no
one
could
have
denied
in
a
certain
sense
graceful
and
thoroughly
her
figure
would
have
stood
the
test
of
pretty
sharp
even
feminine
criticism
as
to
complexion
exquisitely
fair
of
which
however
she
paid
the
penalty
if
such
it
be
in
the
colour
of
her
hair
which
though
fine
soft
and
abundant
was
undoubtedly
red
a
deep
warm
red
itself
a
lovely
shade
though
probably
few
would
admire
it
as
that
of
hair
but
now
comes
a
surprise
the
eyes
were
good
hazel
i
think
but
whatever
their
precise
tint
they
always
looked
deep
and
lustrous
for
they
possessed
the
inestimable
to
be
looked
for
in
conjunction
with
such
dark
almost
black
lashes
and
slightly
arched
eyebrows
to
match
oh
what
things
were
said
about
those
eyebrows
and
eyelashes
how
the
sandy
freckled
misses
macdonald
at
altes
whispered
about
a
pity
is
it
not
still
quite
a
young
person
and
really
not
if
she
would
only
leave
herself
each
sister
all
the
same
secretly
experimenting
in
the
privacy
of
her
own
chamber
with
and
nay
for
aught
i
know
with
and
alias
velouté
in
the
vain
hope
of
rivalling
the
beautiful
florence
vain
hope
truly
for
as
to
eyebrows
and
eyelashes
the
girl
was
indebted
to
nature
only
and
indeed
had
she
been
less
gifted
than
she
was
in
these
respects
i
question
much
if
such
expedients
would
have
occurred
to
her
so
perfectly
satisfied
was
she
with
her
outward
appearance
naturally
so
it
must
be
allowed
the
youngest
and
fairest
of
the
three
daughters
of
a
widowed
and
struggling
mother
her
surpassing
beauty
had
from
earliest
childhood
been
impressed
upon
her
as
the
great
fact
of
her
existence
a
fact
utterly
impossible
to
question
or
dispute
that
this
same
beauty
was
to
be
turned
to
the
best
account
in
the
matrimonial
market
followed
naturally
enough
as
the
second
article
of
belief
in
the
poor
creed
of
the
two
plainer
sisters
one
the
elder
was
married
respectably
though
by
no
means
brilliantly
to
a
young
curate
and
in
these
particulars
i
fear
no
exception
to
his
class
the
other
was
hopelessly
engaged
to
a
lieutenant
in
the
navy
dependent
on
his
pay
which
had
hitherto
barely
sufficed
to
keep
his
own
head
above
water
and
whose
only
prospects
consisted
in
a
vague
talk
of
far
distant
but
the
there
was
florence
florence
the
beautiful
whose
brilliant
marriage
was
to
be
the
turning
point
in
the
fortunes
of
her
family
obtain
a
comfortable
living
for
her
older
and
in
some
mysterious
way
to
bring
the
admiralty
to
a
sense
of
what
was
owing
to
the
meritorious
but
unappreciated
lieutenant
hardly
was
the
girl
out
of
short
frocks
and
pinafores
before
the
anxious
scheming
mother
set
to
work
to
plan
her
future
and
obtain
for
her
the
desired
opportunity
nor
must
we
judge
her
harshly
poverty
and
above
all
poverty
of
the
striving
pinching
kind
is
not
an
influence
likely
to
exalt
or
refine
the
character
and
poor
vyse
no
woman
to
begin
with
sank
and
deteriorated
beneath
it
as
many
better
people
have
done
before
and
since
in
one
direction
her
efforts
met
with
success
it
happened
thus
among
the
few
friends
who
in
the
long
weary
years
of
her
and
adversity
still
remembered
vyse
none
was
kinder
or
showed
her
more
substantial
proofs
of
good
will
than
lady
severn
her
cousin
by
marriage
no
very
near
connection
certainly
but
there
was
another
reason
for
this
kindness
to
the
poor
widow
and
her
fatherless
children
the
history
of
dame
eleanor
severn
like
that
of
most
people
in
this
world
had
begun
with
a
first
volume
or
which
the
hero
was
not
her
lamented
and
much
respected
husband
the
late
sir
ralph
severn
but
a
certain
sailor
cousin
of
his
a
handsome
boy
with
beautiful
eyes
gordon
vyse
by
name
of
course
it
was
out
of
the
she
was
an
heiress
consequently
it
would
never
have
done
for
her
to
have
married
a
prospectless
younger
son
in
time
suppose
she
herself
was
brought
to
see
the
thing
in
this
rational
light
any
how
she
married
sir
ralph
her
own
cousin
and
she
being
an
only
child
heir
to
her
title
though
not
to
his
wealth
which
was
all
settled
on
eleanor
severn
herself
so
title
and
wealth
were
by
this
marriage
a
highly
satisfactory
arrangement
in
the
eyes
of
the
family
and
the
world
at
large
nobody
troubled
him
or
herself
much
about
poor
gordon
who
before
long
consoled
himself
by
marrying
considerably
beneath
him
a
rather
pretty
managing
little
woman
who
made
him
as
good
a
wife
as
she
knew
how
and
after
his
death
did
her
poor
best
by
the
three
daughters
left
to
her
care
they
got
on
somehow
florence
seemed
the
most
fortunate
for
lady
severn
saw
her
as
a
child
took
a
fancy
to
her
and
paid
for
her
education
at
a
fashionable
boarding
school
questionable
good
fortune
but
the
girl
was
capable
of
gratitude
and
honestly
loved
her
mother
and
sisters
so
she
made
what
she
truly
believed
to
be
best
use
of
her
educational
privileges
devoted
herself
to
accomplishments
including
the
art
of
dressing
and
arranging
her
magnificent
hair
to
the
best
advantage
and
so
succeeded
as
become
before
she
left
school
the
show
pupil
of
the
establishment
the
thought
of
furnishing
the
inside
of
her
head
with
any
knowledge
really
worth
acquiring
never
occurred
to
her
and
indeed
it
is
difficult
to
say
if
she
could
ever
have
succeeded
in
doing
so
for
the
cleverness
which
she
certainly
possessed
was
of
that
essentially
superficial
kind
to
teachers
far
more
hopeless
to
deal
with
than
any
extreme
of
good
honest
modest
stupidity
grown
up
at
last
ready
in
every
sense
of
the
word
to
out
had
there
been
any
one
to
introduce
her
for
a
tiresome
year
or
two
the
beautiful
florence
languished
at
home
for
some
time
the
distress
in
the
severn
family
put
a
stop
to
all
hopes
of
a
helping
hand
in
that
quarter
at
last
however
vyse
plucked
courage
a
gratefully
expressed
and
judiciously
timed
letter
to
lady
severn
resulted
in
an
invitation
to
florence
to
visit
her
abroad
for
a
few
weeks
so
well
had
the
girl
profited
by
her
instructions
that
the
few
weeks
lengthened
into
months
and
the
latter
had
already
numbered
more
than
twelve
and
still
there
was
no
talk
of
miss
vyse
returning
home
she
knew
how
to
make
herself
useful
her
hostess
who
on
her
side
treated
her
with
the
greatest
generosity
for
she
was
proud
of
her
handsome
young
relative
niece
as
she
preferred
to
call
her
though
in
point
of
fact
the
connection
was
much
more
remote
every
where
miss
vyse
was
admired
and
made
much
of
and
on
the
whole
she
had
spent
a
very
agreeable
year
still
the
great
object
of
her
ambition
a
wealthy
husband
had
not
been
attained
and
for
some
time
past
this
consideration
had
caused
her
no
little
anxiety
there
were
difficulties
in
the
way
lady
continued
mourning
and
sir
indifference
to
society
caused
their
life
to
be
a
very
quiet
one
which
to
florence
was
the
more
provoking
as
she
saw
plainly
that
wherever
they
went
it
only
rested
with
themselves
to
have
the
entrée
of
the
most
select
portion
of
the
fashionable
world
on
coming
to
altes
this
winter
lady
severn
had
kindly
volunteered
to
relax
little
from
her
usual
seclusion
on
her
young
account
pleasant
news
for
florence
she
was
however
too
to
hope
for
very
much
in
the
way
of
gaiety
considering
the
habits
of
her
entertainers
and
she
was
far
too
prudent
to
take
advantage
of
lady
promise
in
any
but
the
most
careful
and
moderate
manner
fearing
lest
the
slightest
appearance
of
discontent
with
their
somewhat
monotonous
life
should
weaken
the
influence
she
had
gained
over
the
mother
and
equally
important
the
favour
she
hoped
to
acquire
in
the
eyes
of
the
son
for
it
had
come
to
this
gradually
but
steadily
for
some
months
past
thoughts
had
been
concentrating
to
this
point
true
sir
ralph
himself
was
far
from
rich
but
then
there
was
considerable
wealth
in
the
hands
of
his
mother
of
which
even
during
her
life
were
he
to
marry
to
please
her
florence
had
every
reason
to
believe
a
fair
potion
would
be
his
it
was
rather
a
bold
idea
but
she
was
not
burdened
with
or
scrupulosity
and
on
the
other
hand
was
by
no
means
deficient
in
tact
and
possessed
besides
the
inestimable
of
supreme
unruffled
and
to
do
her
justice
poor
girl
she
was
strengthened
by
the
thought
of
the
happiness
the
news
of
such
a
marriage
would
diffuse
over
the
dear
faces
at
home
two
distinct
objects
lay
before
her
to
achieve
in
the
first
place
there
was
lady
severn
to
be
won
over
unconsciously
to
her
side
liking
must
be
deepened
to
affection
esteem
and
admiration
judiciously
heightened
till
one
day
it
should
suddenly
break
upon
the
good
lady
entirely
as
an
idea
of
her
own
that
here
beside
her
in
the
person
of
her
young
favourite
the
daughter
of
her
own
first
love
was
the
very
wife
for
her
son
the
woman
of
all
others
beautiful
sensible
and
cheerful
whom
she
would
choose
as
a
helpmeet
for
the
dreamy
studious
unpractical
sir
ralph
so
thought
florence
for
lady
severn
and
so
ere
long
the
unconscious
lady
was
made
to
think
for
herself
for
though
no
plain
words
had
as
yet
passed
between
them
on
the
subject
florence
believed
and
rightly
that
the
first
of
her
designs
was
in
a
fair
way
towards
being
accomplished
but
with
the
contemplation
of
the
second
came
the
of
florence
with
all
her
with
all
her
happy
confidence
in
the
irresistible
nature
of
her
charms
felt
at
a
loss
of
is
not
a
happy
quotation
in
this
instance
for
it
was
no
case
of
greek
versus
greek
but
the
involuntary
repulsion
of
an
utterly
alien
nature
which
so
baffled
this
girl
in
all
her
efforts
ralph
puzzled
her
there
were
so
many
things
about
him
which
he
could
not
understand
no
wonder
for
if
only
she
had
known
it
it
would
have
been
nearer
the
truth
to
say
that
there
was
hardly
one
thing
about
him
which
with
all
the
in
the
world
all
the
capacity
for
lending
herself
to
his
peculiarities
on
which
she
prided
herself
she
could
ever
have
come
to
understand
her
opinion
of
human
nature
in
general
was
by
no
means
an
exalted
one
disinterested
goodness
in
the
highest
sense
was
to
her
incredible
or
rather
inconceivable
strange
at
first
sight
this
may
appear
strange
in
so
young
a
girl
for
florence
was
little
more
than
twenty
and
her
actual
experience
of
the
world
had
not
been
very
extensive
strange
and
no
less
sad
for
the
disbelief
or
slowness
to
believe
in
the
truth
and
goodness
of
our
fellows
which
is
almost
excusable
in
a
soured
and
man
or
woman
of
middle
age
revolts
and
repels
us
in
a
very
young
person
meeting
with
it
we
can
not
but
suspect
some
terrible
defect
in
the
early
of
such
an
one
if
not
some
crooked
tendency
of
peculiar
strength
innate
in
the
character
itself
so
as
i
said
ralph
puzzled
florence
his
devotion
to
study
for
its
own
sake
utterly
indifferent
to
its
bringing
him
name
or
fame
his
distaste
for
society
in
which
nevertheless
his
rank
and
prospects
would
have
insured
him
a
cordial
reception
his
goodness
itself
the
union
of
strength
with
gentleness
which
to
her
seemed
almost
weakness
nay
more
his
very
whole
nature
in
her
utterly
and
above
all
his
indifference
to
her
charms
for
in
this
last
there
was
a
certain
amount
of
inconsistency
not
in
his
being
always
kind
and
attentive
to
her
that
went
for
nothing
she
knew
he
would
have
been
so
to
any
woman
but
over
and
above
this
she
saw
that
he
admired
her
in
a
quiet
cold
sort
of
way
as
if
she
had
been
a
picture
or
a
statue
she
was
pleasing
to
him
as
a
beautiful
object
for
his
perceptions
were
refined
and
correct
to
a
fault
and
even
she
felt
and
truly
that
to
be
thus
admired
by
him
was
worth
all
the
coarser
adulation
of
the
vulgar
triumph
of
reigning
as
a
belle
but
this
was
all
beyond
this
point
she
could
not
succeed
in
impressing
him
at
last
after
much
cogitation
she
decided
in
her
own
mind
that
he
a
student
if
not
already
a
must
be
of
a
different
nature
from
other
men
and
she
must
content
herself
accordingly
one
comfort
certainly
was
hers
she
need
fear
no
rival
past
present
or
future
his
never
having
been
specially
attracted
by
any
young
lady
had
become
as
it
were
a
proverb
in
the
family
and
as
for
anything
no
she
felt
instinctively
there
was
nothing
to
fear
no
awkward
entanglement
which
might
have
precluded
the
idea
of
matrimony
or
engendered
a
distaste
thereto
and
she
was
right
the
life
of
this
man
from
earliest
boy
hood
to
the
present
time
would
have
stood
the
strictest
scrutiny
he
must
have
always
been
she
decided
just
the
same
peculiar
being
she
found
him
now
it
was
simply
not
in
him
to
fall
in
love
lose
his
head
about
anyone
as
she
phrased
it
to
herself
the
best
she
could
hope
for
was
that
he
should
become
as
it
were
accustomed
to
her
regard
her
with
quiet
friendliness
and
respect
feel
a
certain
amount
of
pleasure
in
her
society
so
that
when
his
mother
should
one
day
make
the
proposition
to
him
for
which
florence
was
thus
carefully
paving
the
way
the
idea
should
not
at
least
be
repugnant
to
him
he
would
marry
her
no
doubt
if
his
mother
wished
it
provided
it
could
be
done
without
much
trouble
or
interference
with
his
usual
habits
still
it
was
mortifying
to
think
of
that
with
this
faint
colourless
sentiment
she
must
be
content
for
though
herself
too
cold
or
perhaps
too
thoroughly
selfish
ever
to
experience
the
uncalculating
intensity
of
a
genuine
love
she
was
yet
by
no
means
insensible
to
the
extreme
gratification
the
agreeable
triumph
of
awakening
such
a
feeling
in
all
its
depth
towards
her
in
the
bosom
of
another
she
had
all
the
elements
that
go
to
the
making
of
a
coquette
but
she
was
wise
enough
to
see
that
in
her
critical
position
the
exercise
of
any
such
arts
might
result
in
the
direst
misfortune
to
herself
and
through
her
to
the
only
three
people
in
the
world
she
really
cared
about
the
one
consolation
to
her
wounded
evident
admiration
of
her
beauty
for
its
own
sake
she
sedulously
cultivated
she
was
perfectly
aware
that
it
was
merely
the
gratification
an
artist
experiences
when
brought
into
relation
with
harmony
of
any
kind
an
utterly
different
feeling
from
that
happily
far
more
one
by
no
means
confined
to
artist
natures
which
makes
the
outward
form
precious
for
the
sake
of
its
owner
the
feeling
which
made
makes
rochester
declare
that
atom
or
would
must
be
dear
to
him
in
pain
in
even
in
the
wild
paroxysms
or
insanity
the
feeling
so
exquisitely
described
in
another
sense
in
that
lovely
picture
or
motherhood
when
heather
tells
how
precious
to
her
is
every
freckle
on
her
little
snub
nose
well
aware
that
admiration
for
her
sprung
from
no
root
of
this
kind
florence
found
it
the
more
necessary
to
nurse
and
cherish
with
the
utmost
care
the
delicate
plant
never
in
all
the
months
they
had
been
members
of
the
same
household
had
ralph
seen
her
in
any
but
a
perfectly
and
tasteful
unless
indeed
on
one
or
two
occasions
when
he
had
caught
sight
of
her
in
the
most
becoming
of
studied
her
magnificent
hair
escaped
from
its
trappings
perhaps
or
decorated
with
a
wreath
of
flowers
to
please
her
little
cousins
in
a
game
of
play
which
had
flushed
her
usually
pale
cheeks
with
an
exquisite
bloom
this
sort
of
thing
she
imagined
kept
up
with
sir
ralph
her
character
of
gentle
artlessness
somewhat
subdued
by
the
trials
of
her
past
life
whereas
in
reality
she
neither
sat
nor
moved
looked
nor
spoke
when
in
his
presence
save
with
the
one
purpose
of
strengthening
and
increasing
his
admiration
this
girl
then
as
i
have
shown
her
this
florence
vyse
was
the
young
lady
who
entered
the
room
that
rainy
morning
just
as
marion
had
left
it
florence
my
love
said
lady
severn
as
she
came
in
am
so
sorry
you
did
not
happen
to
come
before
such
a
nice
young
person
has
been
here
applying
as
daily
governess
really
quite
a
superior
girl
evidently
well
brought
up
i
should
fancy
from
what
she
said
that
her
family
must
be
in
reduced
circumstances
i
wish
you
had
seen
her
i
should
have
liked
your
am
sorry
i
did
not
know
you
wanted
me
dear
aunt
replied
the
young
lady
seating
herself
on
a
comfortable
low
chair
near
enough
to
lady
severn
to
be
heard
without
the
disagreeable
exertion
of
raising
her
voice
am
very
glad
to
hear
of
a
suitable
governess
for
the
dear
pets
which
indeed
she
was
from
the
bottom
of
her
heart
having
of
late
had
sundry
most
uncomfortable
misgivings
that
unless
such
a
person
appeared
she
would
before
long
for
the
sake
of
her
character
of
unselfish
amiability
be
obliged
to
offer
her
services
temporarily
at
least
as
instructress
mentally
resolving
that
this
unexpected
deliverance
must
be
accepted
even
though
the
candidate
for
the
undesirable
post
should
be
a
suspected
tool
of
the
jesuits
or
something
equally
objectionable
she
proceeded
to
lady
severn
on
the
subject
and
had
got
the
length
of
hearing
that
miss
freer
was
a
friend
and
guest
of
when
the
door
opened
and
sir
ralph
entered
ralph
said
his
mother
was
just
telling
florence
what
a
nice
governess
i
have
all
but
engaged
for
the
children
replied
he
must
have
dropped
from
the
skies
to
oblige
you
for
at
breakfast
this
morning
florence
was
bewailing
your
disappointment
that
somebody
or
archer
it
not
succeeded
in
finding
some
unfortunate
lady
willing
to
torture
herself
and
the
children
for
so
many
hours
a
day
really
mother
i
think
you
might
leave
them
alone
for
a
while
sybil
is
too
delicate
and
lotty
too
flighty
to
do
much
good
at
must
beg
you
ralph
not
to
speak
in
that
foolish
way
how
can
you
possibly
be
able
to
judge
about
the
education
of
young
girls
florence
who
really
may
be
allowed
to
have
an
opinion
on
the
subject
agrees
with
me
that
they
have
been
running
wild
far
too
dear
aunt
pray
speak
as
if
i
would
dream
of
interfering
interrupted
miss
vyse
only
happened
to
say
the
other
day
that
i
wished
i
had
my
over
again
now
that
i
saw
to
how
much
better
profit
i
might
put
them
though
perhaps
after
all
it
would
not
be
much
use
for
i
am
so
stupid
and
being
with
minds
i
can
really
look
up
to
has
made
me
of
late
painfully
conscious
of
my
own
deficiencies
she
added
with
a
gentle
little
sigh
she
wanted
sir
ralph
to
say
that
he
hated
learned
women
but
he
took
no
notice
of
her
is
really
horribly
boorish
she
thought
to
herself
as
after
waiting
till
she
had
finished
her
pretty
little
speech
he
turned
to
his
mother
and
enquired
and
how
have
you
heard
of
a
governess
then
mother
of
course
if
she
is
a
desirable
person
it
will
be
a
good
thing
for
the
children
i
am
quite
aware
such
things
as
lessons
are
unavoidable
sooner
or
for
the
second
time
lady
severn
related
the
history
of
the
lucky
coincidence
that
had
brought
miss
freer
as
an
applicant
for
the
post
she
ended
by
saying
that
the
young
lady
she
had
called
her
young
to
florence
but
had
such
queer
had
only
just
left
her
then
he
said
must
have
seen
her
as
i
came
in
i
lent
her
my
her
your
umbrella
ralph
what
for
keep
off
the
rain
he
answered
quietly
ralph
do
not
answer
my
questions
in
that
ridiculous
way
you
know
what
i
mean
perfectly
you
are
not
in
the
habit
or
lending
your
umbrella
to
the
first
person
you
happen
to
meet
in
the
not
mother
and
as
it
happens
i
did
not
meet
this
protégée
of
yours
in
the
street
at
all
i
saw
her
as
i
came
in
standing
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
looking
out
at
the
rain
rather
disconsolately
it
never
occurred
to
me
till
i
had
run
up
stairs
that
perhaps
she
had
no
umbrella
and
so
i
ran
down
again
to
see
i
had
no
idea
who
she
was
young
or
old
ugly
or
pretty
i
passed
her
quickly
thinking
of
other
things
which
was
stupid
enough
for
i
might
have
thought
a
lady
would
not
be
standing
staring
at
the
rain
for
any
pleasure
in
the
when
you
ran
down
again
did
you
see
her
cousin
ralph
asked
florence
softly
cousin
florence
he
replied
jestingly
i
am
afraid
i
tell
you
much
about
her
i
only
saw
a
young
girl
with
pretty
brown
hair
for
she
was
standing
with
her
back
to
me
and
hardly
turned
round
to
thank
me
so
eager
was
she
to
run
off
as
soon
as
she
had
the
he
did
not
add
that
as
the
girl
had
retraced
a
step
or
two
to
ask
his
address
her
veil
had
flown
back
and
revealed
a
pair
or
grey
eyes
which
the
word
would
not
have
adequately
described
but
brown
hair
what
evil
genius
prompted
ralph
to
use
the
expressions
the
first
seed
sown
of
many
that
were
in
time
to
yield
a
harvest
of
bitter
fruit
the
first
small
prejudice
planted
in
the
heart
of
a
jealous
and
scheming
woman
pretty
brown
hair
indeed
said
florence
to
herself
and
she
never
forgot
the
words
ralph
so
seldom
seemed
to
notice
anything
pretty
or
ugly
about
a
woman
that
the
slightest
expression
of
admiration
at
once
caught
her
attention
and
in
the
present
case
another
feeling
was
aroused
notwithstanding
all
her
florence
was
to
tell
the
truth
touchy
about
the
colour
of
her
hair
she
thought
it
really
and
truly
the
loveliest
that
ever
grew
on
a
head
but
yet
she
was
aware
that
there
was
a
diversity
of
opinion
on
the
subject
vulgar
people
uneducated
eyes
might
call
it
a
defect
spiteful
people
might
say
spiteful
things
about
it
were
they
so
inclined
she
was
sure
that
ralph
admired
it
for
under
none
of
these
heads
could
be
classed
he
whose
taste
was
refined
and
cultivated
in
the
extreme
must
could
not
but
think
it
beautiful
but
yet
she
could
not
endure
him
to
speak
of
another
brown
they
went
in
to
luncheon
as
they
were
taking
their
seats
at
table
they
were
joined
by
the
two
children
charlotte
the
elder
was
a
tall
child
handsome
already
and
with
promise
of
considerable
beauty
of
the
large
fair
type
a
severn
as
her
father
had
been
before
her
and
already
well
aware
of
the
fact
sybil
was
as
unlike
her
as
in
childhood
ralph
must
have
been
unlike
his
handsome
brother
a
quiet
little
girl
with
a
pale
face
and
straight
rather
dark
hair
sweet
eyes
though
and
indeed
far
from
when
one
examined
the
features
more
critically
few
probably
were
ever
at
the
pains
to
do
so
for
she
was
precisely
the
sort
of
child
that
gets
little
notice
partly
perhaps
because
she
never
seemed
to
expect
it
she
was
rather
an
unsatisfactory
child
her
grandmother
loved
her
and
cherished
her
but
yet
somehow
she
did
not
or
could
not
understand
her
her
great
delicacy
and
the
constant
care
and
indulgence
it
necessitated
would
have
utterly
spoilt
most
children
but
it
had
not
done
so
with
sybil
not
at
least
in
the
ordinary
way
lotty
one
could
see
at
the
first
glance
was
tremendously
spoilt
but
she
was
by
nature
honest
and
hearty
though
selfish
headstrong
and
conceited
conceited
however
in
a
childish
innocent
sort
of
way
laughable
enough
now
and
then
after
all
i
hardly
think
the
conceit
was
indigenous
in
her
i
suspect
miss
vyse
had
had
a
hand
in
the
sowing
of
it
lotty
was
her
avowed
favourite
and
on
the
whole
had
not
improved
in
character
since
florence
had
taken
up
her
residence
among
them
lotty
burst
into
the
room
and
seated
opposite
her
cousin
without
any
of
the
gentle
half
appealing
air
so
pretty
to
see
in
a
girl
of
her
age
she
said
coolly
in
answer
to
her
question
as
to
what
she
would
take
to
say
if
it
that
horrid
kind
we
had
but
observing
a
look
of
gentle
reminder
on
the
face
of
miss
vyse
who
intended
sir
ralph
to
see
it
too
she
beg
your
pardon
grandmamma
for
calling
it
horrible
but
florence
and
i
both
mind
what
we
both
think
lotty
interrupted
miss
vyse
smilingly
dear
will
you
have
some
or
this
little
sybil
was
sitting
quietly
by
her
uncle
her
favourite
place
for
though
frightened
of
him
she
was
always
pleased
to
be
near
him
he
stroked
her
smooth
soft
hair
and
she
looked
up
in
his
face
with
a
smile
you
going
up
the
mountain
uncle
ralph
he
asked
exactly
but
very
early
he
replied
you
going
to
do
early
asked
lady
severn
who
had
not
heard
question
am
going
to
ascend
the
he
answered
think
i
mentioned
it
some
days
ago
there
is
a
whole
party
going
rather
more
than
i
care
about
but
poor
price
and
vladimir
nodouroff
were
very
anxious
for
me
to
join
them
we
dine
at
the
lion
today
and
start
this
evening
if
fine
i
shall
not
be
back
till
the
day
after
but
i
suppose
that
will
make
no
difference
to
you
dear
no
his
mother
do
not
stay
away
longer
than
that
i
want
you
on
friday
to
take
us
all
to
berlet
it
is
rather
too
far
to
go
without
a
gentleman
but
the
view
i
hear
is
shall
be
very
glad
to
take
you
said
ralph
quite
pleased
at
lady
wish
for
his
company
must
all
come
the
children
too
may
they
not
shall
see
was
the
reply
oh
how
provoking
a
one
to
childish
ears
said
ralph
chepstow
has
arrived
here
lately
who
is
anxious
to
make
your
acquaintance
mother
he
is
a
friend
of
the
bruces
at
brackley
they
told
him
of
our
being
here
he
has
lately
lost
his
wife
he
seems
an
honest
stupid
sort
of
man
shall
i
tell
him
you
hope
to
see
him
he
is
going
with
us
friend
of
the
bruces
of
course
i
shall
be
glad
to
see
said
lady
severn
in
a
rather
formal
in
her
heart
she
disliked
the
bruces
her
eldest
wife
had
been
one
of
them
i
must
say
ralph
you
manage
to
describe
people
and
things
in
a
most
peculiar
a
most
characteristic
way
i
should
say
murmured
florence
as
just
at
that
moment
her
aunt
rose
from
table
and
led
the
way
from
the
room
she
could
not
tell
if
ralph
heard
the
little
compliment
he
gave
no
sign
of
having
done
so
truly
his
manners
were
very
objectionable
chapter
vii
the
little
governess
frightful
there
to
see
a
lady
richly
clad
as
she
beautiful
cristabel
metal
more
hamlet
as
she
had
promised
marion
called
the
next
day
to
hear
lady
decision
she
had
not
much
fear
of
its
being
unfavourable
and
from
the
readiness
with
which
the
servant
threw
open
the
door
announcing
her
unprompted
as
miss
freer
she
felt
little
doubt
but
that
the
fact
of
her
new
honours
had
already
transpired
to
the
retainers
of
the
family
lady
severn
was
not
in
the
room
only
miss
vyse
she
was
lying
on
the
sofa
as
marion
entered
but
rose
and
came
forward
to
meet
her
for
half
a
moment
one
of
those
strange
that
seem
so
long
the
two
girls
looked
at
each
other
florence
was
mentally
measuring
this
little
governess
with
the
pretty
brown
hair
measuring
and
weighing
her
and
she
did
it
correctly
enough
so
far
as
her
weights
and
measures
went
pretty
but
pleasing
not
striking
but
with
a
something
that
might
develop
into
a
certain
kind
of
attractiveness
looking
certainly
and
as
to
not
exactly
a
goose
but
by
no
means
a
person
much
to
be
dreaded
far
too
ingenuous
and
florence
felt
relieved
and
inclined
to
be
amiable
and
patronising
which
agreeable
sensation
increased
when
in
grey
eyes
she
read
evident
admiration
for
herself
more
than
admiration
first
glance
at
florence
actually
dazzled
her
she
had
forgotten
all
about
the
existence
of
such
a
person
as
miss
vyse
and
had
entered
the
room
expecting
to
see
only
lady
severn
when
this
radiant
creature
rose
to
greet
her
in
her
gracious
mood
florence
spoke
courteously
and
kindly
yet
with
a
certain
inflection
of
condescension
some
few
words
of
apology
for
lady
absence
aunt
was
obliged
to
go
out
this
morning
she
said
asked
me
to
see
you
instead
and
talk
over
a
little
the
plans
for
my
lessons
the
hours
and
so
on
so
pray
sit
down
miss
freer
lady
severn
may
perhaps
come
in
by
the
time
i
have
given
you
a
little
idea
of
what
she
you
said
marion
and
as
miss
vyse
seated
herself
gracefully
she
thought
again
very
beautiful
you
but
somehow
she
did
not
think
it
quite
in
the
same
way
since
hearing
florence
speak
something
in
her
voice
repelled
her
not
the
tone
of
condescension
that
was
simply
rather
laughable
and
irritating
perhaps
for
the
moment
it
was
no
incidental
inflection
that
she
disliked
it
was
something
in
the
voice
itself
or
rather
it
seemed
to
her
something
wanting
in
it
an
absence
not
of
depth
nor
refinement
nor
sweetness
of
no
one
of
these
exactly
but
of
something
including
and
yet
surpassing
them
all
and
in
a
strange
way
it
seemed
to
her
as
if
her
immediate
perception
of
a
want
in
the
voice
revealed
to
her
at
the
same
moment
an
equally
indefinable
want
in
the
whole
being
of
the
woman
before
her
and
yet
she
was
so
beautiful
if
only
she
had
been
a
picture
instead
of
a
living
being
marion
felt
that
she
could
have
admired
her
with
perfect
satisfaction
but
she
was
brought
back
from
these
fancies
by
miss
proceeding
to
inform
her
that
lady
severn
was
anxious
to
know
if
she
could
commence
her
new
duties
as
soon
as
the
following
monday
yes
said
marion
am
sure
archer
will
be
able
to
spare
me
by
then
she
only
asked
me
to
be
as
much
with
her
as
possible
this
week
as
i
can
help
her
in
arranging
things
a
said
miss
vyse
then
as
to
hours
can
you
be
here
regularly
by
nine
to
which
proposal
also
marion
agreed
and
had
next
to
listen
to
a
dissertation
from
her
companion
on
the
subject
of
the
studies
to
which
lady
severn
especially
desired
her
to
direct
her
attention
miss
vyse
had
rather
got
herself
up
for
the
occasion
and
talked
so
fluently
about
books
and
methods
the
system
on
which
she
herself
had
been
educated
that
she
ended
by
frightening
marion
far
more
than
lady
severn
had
done
the
previous
day
she
was
just
beginning
to
wonder
if
miss
vyse
would
ever
leave
of
talking
when
to
her
great
relief
their
was
interrupted
by
the
entrance
of
lady
severn
and
her
two
morning
miss
freer
said
the
elder
lady
was
quite
obliged
to
go
out
early
this
morning
with
my
but
i
have
no
doubt
miss
vyse
will
have
said
to
you
all
i
wished
i
am
glad
you
are
still
here
as
i
can
now
introduce
these
little
girls
to
you
charlotte
my
dear
this
is
miss
freer
who
has
kindly
undertaken
the
charge
of
your
charlotte
came
forward
frankly
enough
shook
hands
with
marion
in
an
easy
careless
sort
of
way
and
then
turning
to
miss
vyse
began
eagerly
to
relate
to
her
the
event
of
the
visit
to
the
dressmaker
not
seeming
to
think
it
necessary
to
bestow
any
more
attention
on
her
prospective
governess
little
sybil
put
her
hand
in
shyly
glanced
up
half
wistfully
in
her
face
and
there
evidently
reading
encouragement
drew
closer
and
held
up
her
mouth
to
be
kissed
heart
was
of
course
won
on
the
spot
and
she
began
talking
pleasantly
to
the
child
sybil
answered
timidly
but
at
last
gathering
fresh
courage
from
gentle
manner
became
in
her
childish
way
quite
communicative
and
confidential
are
going
a
beautiful
drive
on
friday
she
said
the
way
to
berlet
and
we
are
to
have
tea
in
a
cottage
at
the
top
of
the
hill
will
you
come
too
thank
you
dear
said
marion
you
will
tell
we
all
about
it
on
but
i
would
like
you
to
come
grandmamma
will
you
please
let
miss
freer
come
to
berlet
marion
felt
rather
annoyed
at
the
pertinacity
but
the
suggestion
appeared
strike
lady
severn
in
a
different
way
should
really
be
very
glad
if
you
would
come
miss
freer
she
said
cordially
would
be
an
excellent
way
of
making
acquaintance
with
the
children
and
archer
too
do
you
think
she
would
care
to
be
of
the
party
we
shall
have
two
carriages
so
there
will
be
plenty
of
marion
thought
it
very
probable
that
archer
would
enjoy
the
little
excursion
and
promising
to
let
lady
severn
know
their
decision
by
the
following
day
took
her
departure
after
another
kiss
from
sybil
a
graceful
bow
from
miss
vyse
and
a
rather
cross
shake
of
the
hand
from
lotty
when
interrupted
by
her
grandmother
in
the
midst
of
her
conversation
with
her
cousin
i
wish
sybil
were
to
be
my
only
pupil
thought
marion
as
she
walked
home
lotty
seems
a
frank
sort
of
child
but
i
am
sure
she
is
dreadfully
spoilt
i
make
up
my
mind
about
miss
vyse
how
very
handsome
she
is
and
yet
i
think
i
like
her
i
wonder
if
i
should
have
liked
her
better
had
we
met
as
equals
instead
of
my
being
a
governess
i
wonder
how
she
and
sir
ralph
get
and
so
she
wondered
on
till
she
got
home
and
then
amused
cissy
by
her
adventures
archer
had
never
heard
of
miss
vyse
and
from
description
of
her
felt
curious
to
see
her
she
readily
agreed
to
join
lady
party
to
berlet
and
evidently
was
beginning
to
think
better
of
her
masquerade
as
she
called
it
seeing
that
its
results
so
far
had
been
by
no
means
disastrous
that
afternoon
and
the
next
brought
quite
an
influx
of
visitors
to
pretty
little
fraser
who
proved
on
further
acquaintance
to
be
really
an
intelligent
and
agreeable
woman
and
miss
bailey
the
former
a
good
motherly
creature
and
the
latter
a
pretty
childish
girl
incapable
of
inspiring
very
vehement
feelings
of
any
kind
her
chronic
insipidity
was
increased
at
the
present
time
by
her
imagining
herself
to
be
the
victim
of
unrequited
affection
in
which
melancholy
condition
she
fancied
it
suitable
and
becoming
to
sit
with
her
head
on
one
side
staring
before
her
in
a
vacant
and
slightly
imbecilic
manner
she
took
it
into
her
head
to
form
a
sudden
and
vehement
friendship
for
miss
freer
who
was
rather
puzzled
by
her
at
first
not
being
behind
the
scenes
of
the
silly
heart
want
of
responsiveness
however
did
not
appear
to
chill
her
in
the
least
she
grew
more
and
more
communicative
and
by
the
end
of
the
half
visit
had
all
but
confided
to
her
patient
listener
the
name
of
her
hero
fortunately
bailey
rose
to
go
before
this
juncture
greatly
to
relief
for
her
experience
of
the
gushing
order
of
young
ladies
had
been
extremely
limited
friday
brought
the
berwick
family
en
masse
with
the
exception
that
is
to
say
of
the
invalid
blanche
major
berwick
was
an
old
indian
which
expresses
a
good
deal
his
wife
was
sharp
and
fussy
and
evidently
perfectly
ready
to
gossip
on
the
smallest
provocation
sophy
a
rough
and
ready
sort
of
girl
impressed
marion
rather
more
favourably
than
the
rest
of
the
family
her
strong
affection
for
her
brother
the
young
officer
of
the
table
party
inclined
sisterly
heart
towards
her
before
the
end
of
the
visit
captain
berwick
himself
appeared
he
was
full
of
the
adventures
and
amusement
they
had
met
with
in
their
mountain
expedition
which
he
declared
had
turned
out
famously
party
was
capitally
arranged
he
said
the
right
number
and
all
well
up
to
the
work
excepting
chepstow
he
added
to
his
sister
man
said
she
did
you
do
with
him
him
half
way
he
replied
he
really
is
an
awfully
fellow
it
is
too
bad
the
way
that
conceited
erbenfeld
makes
fun
of
sophy
coloured
think
erbenfeld
is
half
as
conceited
or
disagreeable
as
sir
ralph
severn
said
she
said
cissy
am
sorry
to
hear
sir
ralph
is
so
undesirable
a
companion
for
we
are
going
to
drive
to
berlet
with
the
severns
tomorrow
is
very
foolish
archer
said
her
brother
ralph
is
much
nicer
when
one
comes
to
know
him
i
myself
did
not
at
first
take
to
him
at
all
but
now
that
i
have
seen
a
little
more
of
him
i
really
like
sophy
looked
rather
annoyed
time
you
intend
to
change
your
opinion
of
any
one
in
such
a
hurry
i
wish
you
would
give
me
notice
frank
she
said
and
then
turning
to
archer
she
began
a
rattling
conversation
on
every
subject
under
the
sun
making
fun
of
all
the
people
it
altes
one
after
another
marion
felt
disappointed
something
in
the
girl
had
attracted
her
but
this
sort
of
talk
wearied
and
repelled
her
she
much
preferred
hearing
from
captain
berwick
a
more
detailed
account
of
his
mountain
expedition
which
he
pleased
at
the
interest
this
pretty
girl
took
in
his
recital
was
nothing
loth
to
give
her
he
several
times
alluded
to
the
young
russian
nodouroff
marion
asked
who
he
was
rather
grand
people
i
believe
said
young
berwick
father
is
an
official
of
course
something
about
the
court
the
mother
and
daughter
come
here
almost
every
winter
the
daughter
countess
olga
is
the
most
beautiful
girl
here
at
least
in
my
opinion
some
people
admire
miss
vyse
lady
niece
more
have
you
seen
her
said
marion
think
her
very
she
is
undoubtedly
but
the
countess
expression
is
much
more
to
my
taste
i
am
sure
you
would
think
so
too
there
is
something
melancholy
about
her
face
i
know
if
she
is
really
so
for
i
have
never
spoken
to
beautiful
people
always
look
more
or
less
melancholy
you
think
asked
marion
not
all
miss
vyse
look
melancholy
though
she
tries
it
now
and
then
said
captain
berwick
her
face
is
too
hard
for
that
sort
of
thing
i
hate
a
hard
expression
even
a
goose
like
dora
bailey
is
more
to
my
taste
than
a
beauty
like
miss
is
the
english
gentleman
with
count
vladimir
his
tutor
price
you
mean
he
used
to
be
tutor
poor
wretch
i
do
think
tutors
are
more
to
be
pitied
than
any
order
of
human
beings
except
governesses
do
you
remember
sophy
how
fearfully
you
bullied
yours
a
frown
from
sophy
revealed
to
the
unfortunate
frank
that
he
had
made
a
terrible
blunder
marion
pitied
him
though
not
a
little
amused
at
his
confusion
she
said
quietly
think
all
governesses
are
to
be
pitied
not
at
least
those
like
me
who
live
at
home
and
only
give
daily
lessons
you
think
i
look
very
wretched
do
you
though
i
am
daily
governess
to
lady
little
girls
forgive
me
miss
freer
said
the
young
man
pray
believe
i
am
the
very
last
fellow
on
earth
say
anything
to
hurt
any
one
else
suggested
marion
i
assure
you
you
are
quite
forgiven
captain
but
the
young
soldier
did
not
forget
the
little
incident
nor
did
it
tend
to
lessen
the
favourable
impression
left
on
his
mind
by
pretty
friend
as
berwick
took
leave
she
expressed
a
hope
that
they
should
a
great
deal
of
must
always
come
to
us
on
thursdays
she
said
what
day
are
you
going
to
choose
for
receiving
your
friends
it
had
not
occurred
to
archer
that
any
such
formal
arrangement
would
be
necessary
but
berwick
and
sophy
hastened
to
explain
that
every
one
had
an
home
at
altes
the
english
society
being
limited
people
found
it
necessary
to
make
the
most
of
it
and
as
sophy
said
was
very
provoking
to
spend
an
afternoon
in
calling
on
friends
and
to
find
them
all
out
and
then
on
getting
home
to
find
that
half
of
them
had
been
calling
on
so
cissy
told
her
always
to
come
to
see
her
when
she
could
find
no
one
else
at
home
shall
not
be
such
as
other
people
miss
berwick
for
we
have
not
a
great
many
acquaintances
and
besides
i
am
not
very
strong
she
said
within
a
fortnight
sure
to
know
every
one
here
said
sophy
i
assure
you
you
had
better
fix
a
then
you
choose
one
for
in
see
considered
sophy
is
thursday
then
on
wednesday
the
band
plays
and
i
know
several
people
have
mondays
and
tuesdays
suppose
you
take
fridays
be
it
replied
cissy
on
fridays
if
you
have
nothing
better
to
do
i
shall
hope
to
see
you
here
to
join
marion
and
me
in
our
afternoon
tea
which
when
it
is
fine
enough
we
can
partake
of
on
the
terrace
i
much
of
a
garden
but
what
there
is
looks
pretty
enough
from
the
end
of
the
terrace
a
capital
idea
archer
tea
on
the
terrace
you
may
expect
to
see
sophy
and
me
every
friday
without
fail
said
captain
berwick
and
then
the
visitors
departed
how
tired
i
am
may
cissy
curling
herself
up
in
a
corner
of
the
sofa
am
not
in
love
with
the
berwicks
i
like
the
son
the
best
ring
for
tea
marion
i
must
have
a
cup
or
i
shall
so
they
consoled
themselves
for
the
fatigues
of
the
afternoon
tea
was
as
yet
hardly
a
domestic
institution
but
cissy
be
it
observed
had
a
mind
in
advance
of
the
age
i
hate
old
indians
she
exclaimed
if
ever
you
catch
me
talking
indian
i
give
you
leave
to
cut
my
friday
came
but
in
clouds
and
rain
so
the
berlet
excursion
was
given
up
and
becoming
better
acquainted
with
her
pupils
had
to
be
deferred
till
monday
when
her
new
duties
began
the
first
lessons
passed
off
better
than
the
inexperienced
governess
had
ventured
to
hope
charlotte
was
marvellously
docile
and
attentive
though
evidently
totally
unaccustomed
to
anything
like
regular
study
the
secret
of
her
good
behaviour
transpired
in
the
course
of
the
morning
when
the
children
informed
miss
freer
that
if
they
were
very
obedient
and
industrious
at
lessons
up
to
thursday
happened
to
be
that
day
the
berlet
expedition
was
to
take
place
on
a
much
grander
scale
than
had
been
originally
contemplate
you
are
to
come
miss
freer
and
that
lady
where
you
live
said
little
sybil
launching
out
into
such
enthusiastic
descriptions
of
all
they
should
do
and
see
that
marion
was
obliged
to
remind
her
that
by
too
much
talking
in
they
might
be
in
danger
of
breaking
their
condition
girls
he
industrious
at
lessons
if
thinking
of
birthday
treats
all
the
time
you
know
so
the
child
dutifully
set
to
work
again
labouring
hard
at
words
of
two
syllables
which
was
the
stage
she
had
reached
in
her
she
was
very
ignorant
for
ten
years
old
and
indeed
the
little
she
did
know
had
been
imperfectly
and
irregularly
acquired
she
was
naturally
slow
though
by
no
means
stupid
there
were
strange
fitful
gleams
of
decided
originality
about
her
a
delicacy
of
perception
and
an
almost
morbid
sensitiveness
which
would
have
suffered
terribly
in
the
hands
of
many
teachers
but
marion
though
herself
so
young
and
inexperienced
understood
the
child
instinctively
still
the
was
hard
work
and
but
for
the
extreme
docility
of
the
pupil
and
the
patient
gentleness
of
the
teacher
would
have
been
the
cause
of
no
little
irritation
to
both
lotty
was
decidedly
clever
when
she
chose
to
exert
or
rather
i
should
say
to
concentrate
her
powers
strong
and
healthy
and
under
good
management
she
promised
to
turn
out
a
sensible
and
intelligent
woman
but
and
fond
of
admiration
and
amusement
the
risk
to
such
a
nature
from
injudicious
training
was
far
greater
than
to
that
of
her
little
sister
that
lotty
would
develop
rapidly
for
good
or
evil
was
evident
sybil
on
the
contrary
might
be
stunted
or
withered
but
would
never
run
wild
but
they
were
both
interesting
children
and
marion
was
very
happy
this
morning
in
the
receipt
of
a
grateful
letter
from
harry
a
letter
which
cheered
her
about
him
in
every
way
he
had
a
good
lesson
he
said
but
thanks
to
her
had
incurred
no
disgrace
and
he
begged
her
to
believe
that
never
again
would
he
cause
her
such
sorrow
and
anxiety
make
grand
promises
he
wrote
i
think
the
future
will
show
that
i
mean
what
i
say
i
shall
always
feel
that
but
for
you
dear
may
my
whole
life
might
have
been
spoilt
as
you
ask
me
not
to
tease
about
where
you
got
the
money
i
do
so
but
i
do
trust
it
has
not
greatly
inconvenienced
or
harassed
so
the
studies
passed
off
prosperously
and
marion
wrote
on
two
slips
of
paper
her
report
of
her
pupils
for
lady
edification
obedient
and
very
for
which
she
was
rewarded
by
a
hug
from
lotty
and
an
affectionate
kiss
from
sybil
that
afternoon
as
cissy
was
resting
on
the
sofa
after
walking
with
marion
to
return
some
of
the
visits
paid
them
the
previous
week
they
were
surprised
by
the
entrance
of
sir
ralph
severn
he
seemed
pleased
to
renew
his
acquaintance
with
archer
and
apologised
for
not
having
recognized
her
at
the
table
not
knowing
me
was
very
excusable
i
think
said
archer
it
is
seven
years
since
we
met
at
years
only
said
he
i
could
fancy
it
was
i
look
such
an
old
woman
already
asked
cissy
maliciously
sir
ralph
looked
confused
do
beg
your
pardon
archer
he
exclaimed
am
sure
i
have
said
so
indeed
i
doubt
if
i
was
ever
anything
else
my
remembrance
of
you
at
cairo
is
that
you
then
looked
very
very
young
a
mere
child
i
was
going
to
say
but
i
am
not
at
all
sure
that
such
an
expression
would
not
be
as
bad
as
the
other
we
take
the
middle
course
then
said
cissy
neither
an
old
woman
nor
a
mere
child
i
may
consider
myself
as
somewhere
between
the
two
but
seriously
sir
ralph
though
you
call
me
an
old
woman
i
hope
for
my
sake
you
will
consider
me
as
an
old
friend
george
will
be
really
pleased
to
hear
of
your
coming
to
see
me
and
if
you
find
the
company
of
two
ladies
unendurably
stupid
i
hope
now
and
then
you
will
look
in
when
you
have
nothing
better
to
sir
ralph
seemed
pleased
are
very
good
archer
i
shall
like
to
come
and
see
you
now
and
then
i
should
like
to
hear
about
archer
i
should
say
you
know
how
kind
he
was
to
me
long
ago
indeed
i
have
more
to
thank
him
for
than
any
one
knows
i
may
as
well
tell
you
what
i
mean
for
i
should
like
you
to
tell
him
about
it
some
day
it
was
long
ago
before
you
were
married
an
unlucky
stupid
misunderstanding
had
arisen
between
my
brother
his
friend
and
me
john
was
naturally
enough
provoked
at
me
and
i
utterly
mistaking
him
was
in
a
wretched
state
of
wounded
pride
and
mortification
my
mother
tried
to
set
it
right
but
failed
i
was
on
the
eve
of
going
abroad
with
all
this
miserable
cloud
between
us
when
luckily
george
archer
came
to
medhurst
it
is
a
thankless
task
meddling
between
relations
but
he
braved
it
and
succeeded
as
he
deserved
john
and
i
parted
the
best
of
friends
and
you
will
understand
how
doubly
grateful
i
felt
to
archer
when
i
tell
you
that
i
never
saw
my
brother
again
in
warm
little
heart
was
won
you
sir
ralph
she
said
telling
me
but
have
you
never
seen
george
since
then
yes
at
cairo
you
remember
but
that
was
very
soon
after
all
this
happened
and
at
that
time
i
little
thought
that
my
farewell
to
john
thanks
to
archer
a
friendly
one
was
indeed
a
farewell
for
ever
in
this
world
yes
i
should
much
like
to
see
archer
he
added
dreamily
think
he
would
enter
into
some
of
my
for
he
was
very
fond
of
john
those
poor
little
girls
have
you
seen
them
archer
not
yet
but
i
have
of
course
heard
a
great
deal
about
them
from
marion
marion
dear
she
went
on
but
looking
round
no
marion
was
to
be
seen
freer
said
sir
ralph
stupid
i
am
i
have
frightened
her
away
by
engrossing
you
in
my
selfish
conversation
pray
archer
ask
her
to
return
i
really
want
to
thank
her
for
her
kindness
in
undertaking
to
teach
those
dreadfully
ignorant
charlie
at
that
moment
appearing
most
opportunely
was
sent
to
recall
the
truant
he
shouted
gentleman
wants
you
this
which
intimation
or
her
presence
being
desired
did
not
by
any
means
hasten
the
young
movements
when
she
she
was
greeted
with
reproaches
from
cissy
and
apologies
from
sir
ralph
thought
you
had
a
good
deal
to
talk
about
she
said
i
am
sure
that
sir
ralph
would
have
minded
your
hearing
may
said
cissy
has
only
been
making
me
more
conceited
than
ever
about
my
surest
way
to
winning
favour
i
can
assure
you
observed
marion
it
had
been
on
his
lips
to
say
something
to
her
of
his
satisfaction
that
she
had
undertaken
the
charge
of
his
nieces
to
give
her
even
should
he
have
an
opportunity
a
little
advice
about
these
children
but
something
in
her
manner
made
it
impossible
for
him
to
carry
out
his
intention
a
certain
unconscious
of
perfect
equality
in
their
positions
an
utter
absence
of
anything
like
the
feeling
of
dependence
in
her
whole
air
and
bearing
nothing
presuming
nothing
affected
she
was
evidently
quite
at
her
ease
and
accustomed
to
feel
so
anything
more
unlike
the
shrinking
modest
young
governess
he
had
from
his
description
expected
to
meet
it
was
utterly
impossible
to
imagine
he
could
not
make
her
out
she
is
she
can
not
have
been
brought
up
with
the
idea
of
occupying
a
dependent
position
he
said
to
himself
and
then
thought
no
more
about
it
but
gave
himself
up
to
the
to
him
rare
pleasure
of
spending
an
hour
with
two
agreeable
women
one
of
whom
was
lively
and
amusing
and
the
other
something
more
than
either
what
he
could
not
exactly
say
not
beautiful
not
brilliant
not
fascinating
what
then
something
that
suited
and
interested
him
something
original
unlike
what
he
had
seen
in
other
women
and
so
unconscious
so
artless
so
thoroughly
womanly
over
and
over
again
he
found
himself
asking
lay
the
charm
grey
eyes
brown
hair
sweet
voice
sweeter
smile
which
of
you
all
has
to
answer
for
it
none
yet
all
a
something
including
and
surpassing
all
these
a
something
so
subtle
and
indefinable
that
not
in
all
the
long
roll
of
years
since
this
old
world
began
has
poet
breathed
or
minstrel
sung
words
which
to
those
who
have
never
felt
it
for
themselves
can
in
the
least
picture
or
describe
this
strange
sweet
sad
mystery
poor
ralph
it
was
only
the
beginning
of
the
old
old
story
after
all
little
though
he
thought
it
that
pleasant
afternoon
when
he
sat
in
pretty
drawing
room
talking
lightly
and
merrily
even
with
these
two
of
books
and
flowers
and
music
of
all
manner
of
things
under
the
sun
it
little
mattered
what
marion
somehow
had
a
knack
of
understanding
words
almost
before
they
were
uttered
she
said
the
right
things
in
the
right
way
at
least
when
she
felt
she
was
with
those
who
on
their
side
liked
and
understood
her
how
they
all
three
talked
and
laughed
agreed
and
argued
ralph
walking
home
thought
what
a
pleasant
refreshing
afternoon
be
had
spent
after
all
he
was
glad
to
find
he
was
not
yet
so
old
and
stiff
but
that
he
could
now
and
then
unbend
a
little
of
course
when
in
company
with
younger
and
more
brilliant
men
he
could
not
expect
to
be
so
made
of
and
entertained
as
he
had
been
today
but
for
once
in
a
way
it
was
a
pleasant
change
and
then
he
fell
to
thinking
how
strange
it
was
that
he
should
be
so
different
from
other
men
have
i
always
lived
so
lonely
and
apart
why
have
i
never
cared
when
i
was
younger
and
in
the
way
of
such
things
for
any
sweet
gentle
woman
who
might
in
time
have
learnt
to
care
for
me
surely
it
was
very
strange
it
never
occurred
to
him
that
after
all
it
was
not
yet
too
late
for
the
tree
of
his
life
to
bear
the
fruit
of
love
all
the
richer
and
fuller
perhaps
for
having
been
somewhat
late
of
maturing
he
imagined
himself
altogether
beyond
the
pale
of
such
things
too
hard
and
dry
too
naturally
unimpressionable
might
he
not
think
so
he
had
escaped
from
much
fascination
for
his
life
had
not
been
altogether
spent
in
a
study
or
a
cell
he
had
seen
beauty
in
all
its
forms
he
had
even
most
unanswerable
of
all
been
rather
revolted
than
charms
displayed
expressly
for
his
benefit
those
of
the
beautiful
florence
vyse
chapter
viii
beauty
and
the
beast
margaret
this
reason
i
should
wish
never
to
be
in
love
all
the
days
of
my
life
the
loss
would
grieve
me
to
mephisto
must
have
sorrow
sorrow
faust
the
lessons
went
on
fairly
enough
there
were
days
on
which
conduct
could
not
be
truthfully
described
as
and
attentive
days
too
on
which
poor
sybil
was
provokingly
absent
and
dreamy
still
there
was
nothing
of
sufficient
importance
to
risk
the
forfeiture
of
the
promised
treat
sybil
indeed
was
not
deserving
of
blame
for
the
sleepy
stupid
moods
that
occasionally
her
as
marion
learnt
to
know
her
better
she
found
that
these
always
preceded
periods
of
sharp
suffering
for
the
poor
child
some
hours
of
headache
almost
maddening
in
its
intensity
and
invariably
followed
by
prostration
and
weakness
painful
to
witness
it
seemed
to
marion
anxious
for
the
peace
and
comfort
that
there
must
be
some
cause
for
these
attacks
for
they
evidently
had
to
do
greatly
with
her
mental
and
nervous
condition
at
the
time
she
tried
gradually
to
gain
the
little
confidence
for
that
there
was
something
to
tell
she
felt
convinced
but
whenever
she
thought
that
sybil
was
on
the
verge
of
disclosing
her
secret
distress
the
child
seemed
to
grow
frightened
again
and
would
say
no
more
the
days
passed
on
smoothly
and
pleasantly
the
acquaintances
archer
had
already
made
were
increased
by
a
few
more
so
that
every
day
brought
its
own
little
plan
or
amusement
some
one
to
call
on
the
band
playing
on
the
and
on
fridays
their
own
miniature
reception
on
the
terrace
captain
berwick
was
as
good
as
his
word
and
unfailingly
made
his
appearance
he
asked
and
obtained
permission
to
introduce
to
her
his
friend
chepstow
who
was
certainly
fully
deserving
of
the
epithet
of
most
fellow
notwithstanding
his
condition
of
inconsolable
widowhood
he
managed
to
get
on
very
comfortably
every
house
in
altes
was
open
to
the
reputed
millionaire
whose
endless
variety
of
carriages
and
horses
was
always
at
the
disposal
of
his
friends
he
entreated
archer
to
consider
as
her
own
a
charming
which
she
was
one
day
rash
enough
to
admire
the
offer
was
made
in
all
sincerity
and
but
cissy
had
too
much
good
sense
to
avail
herself
of
it
to
any
great
extent
not
so
sophy
berwick
she
notwithstanding
her
remonstrations
drove
ponies
rode
horses
whenever
the
inclination
seized
her
for
either
of
these
amusements
and
this
at
the
very
time
that
she
was
making
fun
of
him
in
all
directions
old
that
he
is
she
said
one
day
to
marion
when
they
happened
to
meet
at
is
always
going
on
at
me
as
if
one
should
be
as
particular
with
those
sorts
of
people
as
with
equals
he
is
certainly
very
otherwise
i
would
not
put
myself
under
an
obligations
to
him
but
seriously
he
may
be
very
much
obliged
to
me
for
exercising
his
horses
he
is
so
fat
the
would
break
down
if
he
got
into
it
and
he
is
far
too
frightened
to
attempt
to
ride
you
agree
with
it
miss
freer
would
much
rather
you
did
not
ask
me
miss
berwick
replied
marion
if
i
know
what
that
means
exclaimed
sophy
can
see
you
like
me
miss
freer
i
am
too
noisy
and
rattling
for
you
but
truly
i
am
very
and
i
would
really
like
you
to
tell
me
what
you
think
i
be
a
bit
offended
i
assure
then
if
you
will
have
it
miss
berwick
said
marion
do
think
your
brother
is
quite
right
in
the
first
place
it
would
to
me
be
very
disagreeable
to
put
myself
tinder
an
obligation
to
any
one
a
gentleman
especially
who
was
not
much
more
to
me
than
a
mere
acquaintance
and
in
the
second
place
it
would
be
to
me
not
merely
disagreeable
but
actually
impossible
to
receive
benefits
from
a
person
whom
i
looked
upon
with
the
contempt
which
you
appear
to
feel
for
chepstow
more
than
contempt
you
ridicule
and
deride
him
constantly
make
fun
even
of
his
personal
peculiarities
on
all
occasions
i
like
it
at
all
miss
berwick
though
i
should
never
have
said
this
unless
you
had
asked
marion
spoke
indignantly
for
she
really
felt
so
sophy
had
called
chepstow
strange
perversion
that
she
should
be
so
sharp
to
perceive
the
outward
deficiencies
in
speech
or
manner
of
the
honest
millionaire
and
yet
be
so
utterly
blind
to
the
far
more
repulsive
vulgarity
of
her
own
speech
and
behaviour
sophy
did
not
answer
marion
began
to
fear
she
had
really
offended
her
when
looking
up
she
saw
that
the
face
though
grave
bore
by
no
means
an
angry
expression
freer
she
said
at
last
think
i
deserve
what
you
say
i
have
got
into
reckless
careless
sort
of
way
of
going
on
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
am
not
very
happy
at
home
and
so
long
as
i
can
get
something
to
amuse
me
riding
or
driving
or
making
fun
of
people
it
does
not
much
matter
which
i
fear
i
think
very
little
about
how
i
get
it
frank
is
the
only
person
who
cares
about
me
at
all
and
even
he
gives
me
credit
for
very
little
good
one
thing
i
will
promise
you
and
that
is
to
leave
of
making
fun
of
poor
old
chepstow
so
long
at
all
events
as
i
continue
to
use
his
horses
there
now
miss
freer
it
true
that
i
am
indeed
it
is
said
marion
heartily
even
more
amiable
than
you
think
sophy
went
on
believe
any
other
girl
with
a
favourite
brother
would
have
tried
to
make
friends
with
a
girl
that
same
brother
is
always
praising
up
to
the
skies
and
holding
up
as
an
example
sister
to
follow
you
will
let
me
make
friends
with
you
miss
freer
you
you
think
i
have
done
so
already
asked
marion
assure
you
i
wonder
at
myself
for
speaking
so
plainly
as
i
did
i
could
not
have
done
so
to
a
person
i
had
not
a
friendly
feeling
you
said
sophy
is
a
very
pretty
way
of
taking
out
the
sting
of
your
very
decided
and
then
they
rambled
on
to
other
subjects
the
excursion
to
berlet
in
which
the
berwicks
were
to
join
the
balls
sophy
was
anticipating
and
some
few
allusions
to
the
she
had
hinted
at
her
irritability
her
overweening
partiality
for
blanche
blanche
herself
with
her
everlasting
ailments
yet
with
all
i
think
i
could
be
very
fond
of
her
if
she
would
let
me
said
sophy
is
really
sensible
and
satisfactory
when
she
chooses
and
long
ago
miss
freer
she
was
so
i
have
heard
said
marion
not
however
encouraging
further
revelations
of
home
secrets
the
girl
was
really
not
without
many
good
qualities
wanting
in
delicacy
no
doubt
far
too
and
pronouçée
but
affectionate
and
open
to
good
impressions
and
above
all
thoroughly
honest
and
true
this
was
the
reason
of
the
liking
marion
felt
for
her
this
was
why
she
so
much
preferred
sophy
rough
and
even
in
a
sense
unrefined
to
the
graceful
faultlessly
florence
sir
call
was
not
repeated
for
some
little
time
cissy
and
marion
met
him
one
day
and
when
the
former
reproached
him
for
not
having
come
again
to
see
her
he
confessed
that
he
had
been
on
his
way
thither
the
friday
previous
but
meeting
captain
berwick
and
hearing
from
him
that
this
was
day
had
thought
better
worse
cissy
suggested
of
it
and
turned
back
then
i
think
you
very
silly
and
provoking
was
all
the
sympathy
he
got
cissy
provoking
she
added
we
had
quite
a
little
concert
and
i
know
you
like
music
indeed
a
little
bird
once
told
me
you
sang
yourself
we
are
short
of
a
voice
for
that
pretty
glee
marion
turning
to
her
wonder
if
sir
ralph
would
take
that
sir
ralph
looked
any
thing
but
inclined
to
do
so
archer
he
said
give
me
credit
for
powers
i
do
not
possess
little
birds
at
altes
i
am
sorry
to
say
as
well
as
in
england
tell
a
great
many
stories
my
singing
is
a
thing
of
the
past
not
that
it
ever
was
much
of
a
thing
at
and
then
as
if
anxious
to
change
the
subject
he
turned
abruptly
to
marion
you
sing
then
miss
freer
he
asked
little
replied
she
and
then
smiling
at
herself
she
added
must
not
laugh
at
my
very
answer
in
my
case
it
is
simply
the
should
like
to
hear
you
and
then
i
can
judge
he
said
and
without
giving
cissy
time
to
invite
him
to
come
to
her
house
for
the
purpose
of
criticising
her
singing
he
exclaimed
hurriedly
really
must
not
keep
you
standing
good
morning
archer
i
am
sorry
i
have
forfeited
your
good
and
so
left
them
marion
said
cissy
i
thought
him
so
nice
the
other
day
i
can
not
say
that
i
think
so
now
he
is
very
rough
and
cissy
you
teazed
him
on
purpose
i
think
you
deserved
what
you
are
an
impertinent
little
cats
miss
freer
replied
her
cousin
after
which
relief
to
her
feelings
archer
recovered
her
good
humour
and
they
spent
an
amicable
evening
this
was
the
day
before
birthday
there
had
been
some
slight
discussion
consultation
rather
between
lady
severn
and
her
niece
as
to
the
advisability
of
inviting
the
daily
governess
to
make
one
of
the
party
to
berlet
but
as
lady
severn
wished
to
pay
some
attention
to
archer
and
it
would
have
been
awkward
to
invite
that
lady
without
the
young
girl
whom
she
evidently
looked
upon
as
a
valued
friend
and
guest
it
was
decided
that
the
invitation
should
include
miss
freer
the
children
would
have
rebelled
had
their
dear
miss
freer
been
left
out
indeed
they
would
naturally
enough
have
looked
upon
such
an
omission
as
a
gross
breach
of
promise
as
their
governess
had
been
asked
to
make
one
of
the
previous
expedition
which
the
weather
had
put
a
stop
to
dear
aunt
suggested
florence
the
sensible
think
for
every
sake
her
own
especially
it
is
well
to
show
that
she
is
invited
as
the
governess
of
course
had
she
been
governess
to
any
one
else
the
mere
fact
of
her
staying
in
house
would
not
have
made
it
necessary
for
you
to
notice
course
not
my
dear
replied
lady
severn
how
can
i
draw
the
distinction
i
quite
agree
with
you
about
it
but
i
see
how
it
is
to
be
is
difficult
certainly
said
florence
is
the
worst
part
of
a
somewhat
anomalous
position
like
miss
i
am
glad
she
is
coming
for
i
am
anxious
for
the
sake
to
get
to
know
her
a
little
better
i
have
gone
into
the
schoolroom
now
and
then
but
i
am
so
afraid
of
seeming
to
interfere
in
any
is
very
kind
of
you
my
dear
to
take
such
an
interest
in
the
children
miss
freer
could
not
possibly
think
any
such
kindness
on
your
part
interference
replied
lady
severn
i
know
it
is
better
not
to
risk
it
besides
i
really
think
lofty
and
sybil
are
getting
on
very
well
with
her
but
do
you
know
aunt
i
quite
make
her
out
she
is
inconsistent
altogether
her
manners
her
general
appearance
her
dress
even
are
not
the
least
like
what
one
expects
in
a
girl
brought
up
to
be
a
have
not
observed
any
inconsistency
of
the
kind
said
lady
severn
i
dare
say
my
eyes
are
not
so
quick
as
yours
the
only
time
i
can
really
say
i
had
any
conversation
with
her
was
the
first
day
she
called
when
she
appeared
a
gentle
modest
young
person
i
understood
her
to
say
that
her
family
had
met
with
misfortunes
which
had
led
to
her
becoming
a
governess
these
things
happen
every
day
you
know
my
dear
in
the
middle
classes
rich
one
day
and
poor
the
next
but
to
return
to
our
plans
for
what
arrangement
do
you
think
will
be
best
about
miss
freer
was
thinking
said
miss
vyse
it
might
be
as
well
if
miss
freer
were
to
come
as
usual
at
nine
and
start
from
here
in
the
same
carriage
as
the
children
you
dear
aunt
might
propose
to
call
for
archer
on
your
way
past
her
house
which
would
save
her
the
fatigue
of
the
walk
here
in
the
first
said
lady
severn
will
do
very
well
knowing
that
charlotte
and
sybil
are
with
their
governess
i
shall
feel
comfortable
about
them
i
must
consult
with
ralph
about
the
carriages
there
are
our
own
two
and
chepstow
has
offered
any
of
his
we
for
chepstow
had
called
at
the
rue
des
lauriers
and
been
graciously
received
by
the
dowager
and
her
fascinating
niece
it
was
part
of
worldly
wisdom
always
to
be
civil
to
people
in
the
first
place
time
enough
to
snub
and
chill
them
if
they
turned
out
useless
or
not
worth
cultivating
further
easier
far
to
do
this
than
to
undo
the
prejudicial
effects
of
a
haughty
or
freezing
manner
on
first
introduction
and
in
the
present
case
that
of
chepstow
if
he
were
only
half
or
even
a
quarter
as
rich
as
report
said
he
would
still
be
well
deserving
of
some
judicious
to
miss
scale
of
judgement
on
such
matters
another
little
conversation
on
the
subject
of
the
berlet
expedition
took
place
this
same
thursday
evening
between
archer
and
her
cousin
a
note
from
lady
severn
explaining
the
proposed
arrangements
for
the
morrow
brought
the
subject
to
mind
may
she
said
are
you
going
to
wear
was
thinking
about
it
replied
marion
thoughtfully
should
like
to
wear
that
gauzy
dress
white
you
know
with
rosebuds
it
is
deliciously
cool
and
then
my
white
bonnet
matches
it
so
and
why
you
wear
it
asked
cissy
is
a
perfectly
suitable
certainly
for
marion
vere
but
i
am
by
no
means
sure
that
it
is
equally
so
for
miss
freer
replied
marion
on
earth
do
you
mean
child
asked
cissy
what
i
say
as
long
as
i
have
to
act
what
you
call
my
farce
i
think
i
should
do
so
as
consistently
as
possible
and
from
some
little
things
lofty
severn
has
told
me
i
am
afraid
i
have
been
careless
miss
vyse
it
appears
has
remarked
in
the
hearing
that
my
dress
is
unbecoming
to
my
station
and
of
all
people
in
the
world
i
should
least
like
her
to
begin
making
remarks
about
of
all
people
asked
cissy
know
replied
marion
like
her
and
i
trust
her
and
about
all
i
can
say
no
doubt
if
she
were
finding
out
about
who
i
really
am
she
might
do
me
great
course
she
might
said
cissy
one
thing
i
must
say
marion
were
it
found
out
that
you
are
not
really
miss
freer
i
should
feel
myself
bound
in
your
defence
to
tell
the
whole
story
from
beginning
to
end
i
could
not
consent
to
screen
part
in
it
any
has
had
no
part
in
it
said
marion
eagerly
know
this
governessing
scheme
was
most
entirely
my
own
no
one
could
be
blamed
for
it
but
was
reply
am
by
no
means
sure
of
that
i
should
most
strongly
object
to
meeting
uncle
vere
after
he
had
learnt
my
part
in
it
however
i
should
bear
that
and
more
too
rather
than
not
let
your
conduct
be
seen
in
a
proper
light
but
no
good
talking
about
it
i
trust
most
devoutly
you
may
continue
miss
freer
as
long
as
we
are
at
altes
i
have
only
warned
you
what
i
should
think
it
right
to
do
in
case
of
any
well
said
marion
but
the
conversation
was
not
without
its
result
with
a
girlish
sigh
of
regret
she
put
away
the
pretty
rosebud
dress
and
laid
out
for
the
wear
an
unexceptionably
quiet
and
inexpensive
costume
of
simply
braided
but
i
question
much
if
so
attired
my
marion
was
any
less
winningly
lovely
than
in
the
glistening
gauze
the
grey
eyes
looked
out
as
soft
and
deep
from
under
the
shade
of
the
brown
straw
hat
as
from
among
the
flowers
and
fripperies
of
the
dainty
paris
bonnet
still
she
was
not
so
much
above
the
rest
of
her
sex
and
age
but
that
this
called
for
some
friday
morning
was
cloudlessly
fine
the
sky
was
of
that
same
even
intense
blue
which
had
so
impressed
marion
on
her
first
arrival
in
the
south
and
as
she
walked
to
the
rue
des
lauriers
the
girl
felt
joyous
and
she
found
lotty
and
sybil
watching
for
her
in
their
different
ways
the
two
children
were
full
of
delight
at
the
prospect
of
the
treat
and
marion
felt
glad
that
lessons
had
formed
no
part
of
the
programme
as
such
a
thing
as
sitting
still
would
have
been
quite
beyond
the
power
of
her
excited
little
pupils
by
ten
the
various
carriages
assembled
lady
severn
and
two
friends
of
hers
the
english
clergyman
at
altes
and
his
wife
seated
themselves
in
the
first
and
drove
off
to
pick
up
archer
marion
looking
out
from
the
schoolroom
window
did
not
envy
cissy
her
long
drive
in
such
company
then
came
driven
in
the
height
of
his
exhilaration
by
that
adventurous
individual
himself
miss
vyse
was
invited
to
occupy
one
of
the
two
vacant
seats
but
in
some
graceful
manner
succeeded
in
evading
the
honour
after
a
little
consultation
sophy
berwick
nothing
loth
took
her
place
followed
somewhat
but
then
in
pleasure
parties
the
wrong
people
always
get
together
her
so
gossips
said
former
admirer
the
cynical
erbenfeld
next
appeared
a
larger
and
evidently
hired
carriage
already
occupied
by
papa
and
mamma
berwick
and
a
pale
girl
whom
marion
rightly
concluded
to
be
the
invalid
blanche
no
one
appearing
ambitious
of
making
a
fourth
in
this
vehicle
it
drove
on
now
dashed
up
what
call
a
appointed
equipage
driven
by
the
handsome
young
russian
nodouroff
seated
beside
him
was
his
tutor
price
who
however
descended
leaving
two
places
to
spare
some
discussion
ensued
as
to
who
should
occupy
them
which
was
ended
by
captain
berwick
hoisting
up
a
laughing
romping
girl
whom
lotty
informed
marion
was
kate
bailey
the
younger
sister
of
the
languishing
dora
only
two
years
older
than
i
am
miss
freer
said
lotty
virtuously
yet
she
goes
to
all
sorts
of
parties
sure
i
know
how
she
ever
learns
any
horses
growing
impatient
young
berwick
jumped
in
after
kate
and
off
they
set
next
drew
up
a
pretty
waggonette
belonging
to
chepstow
into
it
without
hesitation
stepped
miss
vyse
and
dora
bailey
followed
by
the
little
frenchman
de
but
where
was
the
fourth
in
some
unaccountable
manner
this
being
whoever
he
was
had
disappeared
no
one
but
price
stood
waiting
to
ascend
an
angry
toss
of
the
head
from
florence
an
impatient
order
to
the
driver
and
they
drove
off
quickly
rather
lose
the
chance
of
the
companion
she
had
hoped
for
than
by
longer
delay
run
the
risk
of
uninteresting
society
lotty
and
sybil
were
beginning
to
think
themselves
forgotten
poor
children
when
a
familiar
voice
sounded
at
the
door
lotty
now
sybil
old
woman
the
carriage
is
coming
round
for
you
ah
miss
freer
too
ralph
added
as
he
saw
her
beg
your
pardon
i
thought
you
were
to
have
been
picked
up
on
the
road
with
archer
but
never
mind
we
shall
pack
as
they
passed
through
the
there
stood
price
looking
somewhat
disconsolate
not
quite
sure
that
he
had
done
right
in
quitting
his
seat
by
the
side
of
his
pupil
which
yet
his
shrinking
modesty
would
not
have
allowed
him
to
retain
unless
all
the
rest
of
the
company
had
been
already
provided
for
too
still
here
price
exclaimed
sir
ralph
thought
you
had
been
whisked
off
in
the
waggonette
however
all
the
better
if
miss
freer
does
not
mind
a
little
crowding
to
say
miss
freer
in
her
sensible
being
happily
careless
of
crushing
or
squeezing
the
whole
party
was
soon
comfortably
established
in
the
roomy
carriage
little
face
wore
an
expression
of
perfect
content
lotty
having
obtained
her
consent
to
sit
beside
the
driver
was
no
less
well
pleased
her
incipient
airs
of
fine
ladyism
forgotten
for
the
time
she
became
the
hearty
happy
child
nature
meant
her
still
to
be
chattering
to
the
coachman
in
her
broken
french
and
translating
his
replies
for
the
benefit
of
the
less
accomplished
sybil
both
children
really
were
their
very
nicest
selves
that
day
and
nice
children
are
by
no
means
a
bad
addition
to
a
party
of
pleasure
for
one
thing
they
are
pretty
sure
to
enjoy
it
which
is
more
than
can
be
said
or
their
elders
what
a
merry
drive
they
had
marion
hardly
recognized
the
silent
melancholy
price
in
the
agreeable
humourous
man
beside
her
sir
ralph
and
he
amused
her
with
reminiscences
of
their
younger
days
from
time
to
time
saddened
by
a
passing
allusion
to
the
brother
she
had
already
heard
of
the
so
affectionately
mentioned
by
sir
ralph
when
speaking
to
archer
now
and
then
the
conversation
became
more
general
subjects
of
public
interest
were
broached
and
commented
upon
by
the
two
gentlemen
in
a
manner
which
caught
attention
for
such
discussions
were
not
as
strange
or
incomprehensible
to
her
as
to
most
girls
of
her
age
sir
ralph
had
the
latest
arrived
english
paper
in
his
pocket
he
glanced
at
it
as
he
went
along
from
time
to
time
reading
out
little
bits
for
the
edification
of
his
companions
once
or
twice
marion
half
unconsciously
made
some
remark
in
response
to
his
remarks
which
showed
that
she
knew
what
she
was
talking
about
though
probably
of
no
great
depth
or
originality
the
second
or
third
time
this
happened
sir
ralph
glanced
at
her
with
a
slight
smile
of
surprise
and
amusement
miss
freer
he
said
must
be
a
great
newspaper
reader
you
are
certainly
better
up
on
that
last
speech
on
the
education
question
of
the
member
for
what
place
does
vere
stand
for
he
asked
turning
to
price
who
could
not
satisfy
him
on
the
point
mind
he
went
on
is
it
you
know
so
much
about
it
miss
freer
as
i
said
you
are
decidedly
more
at
home
in
it
than
price
here
and
that
is
saying
a
good
deal
as
i
in
fifteen
years
succeeded
in
finding
a
subject
he
was
not
at
home
my
dear
boy
said
price
will
really
make
me
blush
and
that
would
look
very
funny
on
an
old
man
like
me
would
it
not
miss
sybil
oh
how
grateful
marion
was
to
the
price
for
thus
opportunely
turning
the
conversation
the
title
of
some
new
book
next
attracted
sir
attention
and
led
to
an
animated
discussion
on
the
previous
works
of
the
same
author
in
interest
of
which
marion
forgot
her
embarrassment
she
little
knew
how
keenly
her
fresh
bright
thoughts
and
enquiries
uttered
with
perfect
simplicity
and
were
appreciated
and
enjoyed
by
her
two
companions
cultivated
nay
even
learned
men
that
they
were
yet
not
too
and
musty
as
cissy
had
called
it
to
value
the
clear
sparkling
of
an
unprejudiced
but
not
uneducated
youthful
intellect
and
better
still
the
softening
beautifying
radiance
of
a
true
gentle
heart
price
as
he
looked
at
her
wondered
if
the
little
infant
daughter
long
ago
laid
to
rest
beside
her
young
mother
in
the
far
of
on
a
welsh
would
ever
had
she
lived
have
grown
to
be
such
a
one
as
the
sweet
bright
girl
beside
him
sir
ralph
as
he
looked
at
her
thought
to
himself
a
might
have
been
had
he
met
this
marion
in
years
gone
by
before
as
he
fancied
youth
and
its
sweet
privileges
were
over
for
him
and
with
these
thoughts
mingled
in
the
hearts
of
both
her
companions
a
manly
pity
for
this
young
creature
apparently
so
alone
in
the
world
and
already
at
the
age
when
most
girls
think
of
nothing
but
pleasure
and
amusement
working
if
not
for
her
daily
bread
at
least
towards
her
own
or
her
support
surely
no
girl
would
be
a
governess
if
she
could
help
it
thought
ralph
as
ever
and
anon
the
curious
indefinable
inconsistency
struck
him
between
this
girl
herself
and
her
avowed
position
we
are
exclaimed
he
rather
dolefully
as
the
carriage
stopped
at
the
little
inn
at
berlet
where
all
vehicles
themselves
a
monsieur
de
called
it
the
ascent
of
the
hill
from
the
top
of
which
was
the
view
could
only
be
managed
on
foot
or
some
of
the
elderly
and
more
ponderous
ladies
had
preferred
the
latter
safe
though
inglorious
mode
of
conveyance
and
had
already
set
off
by
a
more
circuitous
path
the
younger
members
of
the
party
intending
to
climb
up
the
most
direct
way
were
just
about
starting
when
the
last
carriage
containing
our
happy
little
party
arrived
as
marion
was
stepping
out
she
heard
herself
addressed
by
name
freer
said
a
voice
beside
her
can
not
understand
how
it
is
that
you
and
the
girls
came
in
this
carriage
there
must
have
been
some
strange
mistake
which
you
should
have
rectified
lady
severn
is
not
a
little
annoyed
at
it
for
she
particularly
wished
you
and
your
pupils
to
come
alone
with
a
strong
accent
on
the
last
word
marion
turned
round
her
cheeks
pale
with
the
paleness
that
tells
of
deeper
indignation
than
quick
mantling
crimson
vyse
she
said
quietly
do
not
understand
you
if
lady
severn
has
anything
to
find
fault
with
in
me
i
am
perfectly
ready
to
hear
it
the
words
were
taken
out
of
her
mouth
by
price
who
standing
beside
her
had
unawares
heard
the
little
conversation
think
indeed
he
said
has
been
some
mistake
miss
freer
took
her
seat
in
the
carriage
in
which
she
was
asked
to
place
herself
on
these
occasions
little
are
apt
to
occur
i
myself
did
a
very
stupid
thing
for
i
was
as
nearly
as
possible
left
behind
instantly
florence
turned
round
her
face
radiant
with
smiles
price
she
said
hope
you
think
me
so
silly
as
to
be
cross
about
a
trifle
but
you
know
how
particular
lady
severn
is
in
all
arrangements
about
the
children
and
i
was
so
afraid
of
her
thinking
either
miss
freer
or
i
had
neglected
her
price
looked
puzzled
but
said
nothing
however
he
resolutely
attached
himself
to
marion
as
the
party
dispersed
into
twos
or
threes
to
begin
the
ascent
sybil
clung
to
marion
who
felt
some
misgivings
as
to
how
the
little
creature
would
get
to
the
top
when
a
cheerful
behind
them
made
her
glance
round
there
was
frank
berwick
dragging
along
a
reluctant
donkey
which
sir
ralph
was
encouraging
on
the
other
side
to
hasten
its
movements
with
a
cry
of
pleasure
little
sybil
ran
hack
to
her
uncle
who
lifted
her
on
to
her
steed
hardly
had
he
done
so
when
vladimir
appeared
with
a
pencilled
note
for
sir
ralph
he
glanced
at
it
and
with
a
clouded
face
turned
to
the
young
officer
said
he
must
go
to
look
after
some
or
my
other
guests
will
you
help
with
donkey
i
any
sorry
to
trouble
you
but
unless
some
one
leads
it
she
could
not
make
it
go
up
this
steep
said
frank
heartily
may
trust
me
to
get
it
safely
to
the
so
ralph
left
them
on
the
whole
i
think
frank
would
have
regretted
if
price
had
done
the
same
but
this
did
not
appear
to
be
that
worthy
intention
so
captain
berwick
consoled
himself
by
engaging
marion
steadily
in
conversation
and
thus
obliging
her
to
walk
at
the
other
side
of
the
head
for
she
could
not
have
been
cold
or
inattentive
to
one
who
was
showing
such
good
nature
to
her
little
pupil
at
last
they
got
to
the
top
most
of
the
party
were
there
before
them
for
the
tardiness
had
delayed
them
there
was
a
sort
of
terrace
round
the
cottage
or
châlet
rather
from
which
the
view
was
supposed
to
be
seen
in
perfection
it
was
indeed
beautiful
if
only
there
had
not
been
such
a
crowd
of
people
talking
about
it
how
the
young
ladies
cluttered
and
admired
how
the
gentlemen
thought
it
their
duty
to
agree
with
their
observations
however
inane
all
but
ralph
when
marion
first
caught
sight
of
him
he
was
standing
perfectly
silent
beside
florence
who
was
speaking
to
him
in
a
low
voice
from
time
to
time
raising
her
beautiful
lustrous
eyes
to
his
face
with
a
look
half
of
questioning
half
of
appeal
it
was
some
mere
trifle
she
was
asking
him
about
but
as
she
watched
them
marion
thought
to
herself
that
sir
ralph
must
indeed
be
strangely
almost
unnaturally
callous
to
resist
the
fascination
of
such
loveliness
somehow
she
felt
glad
when
the
chorus
of
enthusiastic
admiration
calmed
down
again
and
the
little
groups
dispersed
before
long
whispers
of
began
to
run
through
the
party
and
they
all
adjourned
to
a
smooth
lawn
on
the
other
side
of
the
châlet
where
picnic
parties
were
accustomed
to
dine
marion
found
herself
seated
near
cissy
who
looked
rather
tired
she
whispered
to
marion
nice
it
would
be
if
all
these
people
were
away
still
it
was
very
amusing
on
the
whole
there
were
dignified
lady
severn
and
fat
berwick
seated
on
the
grass
vainly
endeavouring
to
preserve
the
equilibrium
of
their
plates
and
glasses
chepstow
in
a
peculiar
attitude
looking
more
like
a
magnified
frog
than
a
portly
englishman
and
insisting
in
his
exaggerated
politeness
on
constantly
unsettling
himself
to
fetch
something
or
other
which
he
imagined
some
lady
beside
him
to
be
in
want
of
have
no
salt
harper
he
exclaimed
to
the
wife
me
to
fetch
you
some
i
brought
some
of
my
own
knowing
it
is
so
often
forgotten
i
shall
get
it
in
a
moment
it
is
in
the
pocket
of
my
and
up
he
started
one
moment
my
friend
interrupted
mons
de
is
of
the
salt
that
one
has
not
missed
to
upon
which
chepstow
was
with
difficulty
induced
to
himself
charming
it
is
this
scene
continued
the
little
frenchman
with
effusion
must
absolutely
that
i
visit
england
all
that
i
of
her
see
fills
me
with
admiration
above
all
these
what
can
one
desire
of
more
agreeable
than
at
the
once
to
enjoy
the
delights
of
the
nature
the
charms
of
the
society
and
the
sweet
allures
of
the
life
of
de
exclaimed
erbenfeld
i
ask
who
assisted
you
in
the
composition
of
this
little
oration
i
strongly
suspect
chepstow
had
to
do
with
it
it
is
in
his
style
do
you
not
think
so
miss
sophie
he
asked
of
his
neighbour
with
whom
failing
better
he
had
in
a
rather
lukewarm
manner
renewed
his
last
flirtation
sophy
was
on
the
point
of
replying
in
the
same
strain
but
happening
to
glance
in
direction
had
the
to
remain
silent
in
are
opposite
corner
marion
espied
dora
bailey
looking
so
marvellously
brisk
and
lively
that
one
would
hardly
have
recognized
her
the
secret
of
the
change
was
soon
revealed
when
looking
again
miss
freer
perceived
that
young
berwick
was
her
neighbour
for
poor
dora
had
long
before
this
disclosed
his
name
as
that
of
her
chosen
hero
frank
however
did
not
appear
to
be
in
correspondingly
good
spirits
but
everybody
talked
and
laughed
and
eat
cold
chicken
and
drank
champagne
as
if
they
had
been
in
england
so
i
suppose
they
all
enjoyed
themselves
after
luncheon
they
dispersed
in
little
parties
to
ramble
about
the
hill
one
side
of
which
was
covered
by
a
charming
miniature
cissy
was
tired
and
went
into
the
châlet
to
rest
miss
vyse
and
the
other
young
ladies
went
off
to
choose
pretty
to
sketch
followed
by
their
attendant
gentlemen
marion
finding
them
all
scattered
proposed
to
lotty
and
sybil
to
go
a
little
way
into
the
forest
and
there
find
a
nice
seat
where
she
would
tell
them
a
story
her
proposal
was
accepted
with
delight
sybil
only
stipulating
that
they
should
not
go
far
enough
into
the
forest
to
meet
bears
or
wolves
the
story
extended
into
two
or
three
before
the
children
were
satisfied
then
at
last
they
agreed
that
miss
freer
must
be
tired
and
they
amused
themselves
by
discussing
the
rival
merits
of
her
narrations
and
the
was
favourite
though
she
shuddered
as
she
listened
to
the
description
of
the
dreadful
though
amiable
monster
suddenly
a
quick
step
approached
them
and
sir
ralph
appeared
he
threw
himself
down
beside
them
exclaiming
as
he
did
so
beg
your
pardon
miss
freer
but
i
am
so
horribly
tired
i
have
been
on
duty
all
this
time
and
if
had
stayed
longer
i
should
infallibly
have
said
something
rude
to
somebody
so
i
ran
away
to
avoid
getting
into
a
like
the
beast
uncle
ralph
said
lotty
oracularly
a
beast
he
exclaimed
hope
not
lotty
what
on
earth
do
you
mean
said
the
beast
we
have
been
talking
about
beauty
and
the
beast
and
i
thought
when
you
came
growling
so
you
were
just
like
you
lotty
he
said
rather
i
think
i
should
thank
miss
freer
for
the
compliment
should
i
not
what
miss
freer
teaches
you
eh
sybil
to
call
your
poor
old
uncle
a
marion
laughed
but
sybil
looked
distressed
no
dear
uncle
she
said
freer
ever
say
you
were
a
beast
lotty
only
said
it
because
you
growled
but
besides
uncle
ralph
you
know
that
the
beast
was
very
nice
really
he
was
a
beautiful
prince
at
the
was
he
and
how
did
he
come
to
be
so
improved
asked
ralph
with
an
air
of
the
profoundest
interest
because
began
sybil
who
was
beauty
in
the
first
place
interrupted
heir
uncle
was
a
pretty
sweet
young
lady
replied
sybil
indeed
like
you
or
lotty
perhaps
he
suggested
oh
no
not
a
little
girl
a
young
lady
uncle
a
big
young
lady
yes
just
like
miss
freer
a
pretty
sweet
young
lady
just
like
miss
she
turned
the
beast
into
a
beautiful
prince
you
say
i
wonder
how
ever
she
could
do
that
he
said
thoughtfully
you
guess
well
i
will
tell
you
said
sybil
full
of
importance
see
the
beast
was
very
good
and
kind
though
he
was
ugly
and
the
fairy
fixed
that
whenever
any
pretty
young
lady
would
love
him
for
being
good
and
kind
and
not
mind
his
being
ugly
then
that
minute
he
was
to
turn
into
a
beautiful
prince
so
the
very
minute
beauty
said
do
love
you
my
dear
good
beast
he
turned
into
the
prince
it
a
pretty
story
uncle
and
you
think
beauty
must
have
been
just
like
miss
freer
very
pretty
story
indeed
sybil
replied
he
to
the
first
question
but
to
the
second
he
made
no
answer
as
he
lay
on
the
ground
however
he
managed
to
glance
up
slyly
to
see
how
the
young
took
all
these
rather
personal
remarks
but
he
did
not
get
much
satisfaction
face
was
rather
graver
than
usual
but
for
all
other
change
in
its
expression
her
thoughts
might
have
been
far
away
too
far
away
to
have
paid
any
heed
to
the
chattering
what
was
she
really
thinking
the
old
puzzle
wonder
how
sir
ralph
and
miss
vyse
get
on
together
and
why
from
the
first
have
i
disliked
the
one
and
liked
the
other
ralph
seemed
suddenly
to
grow
restless
he
sat
up
and
looked
at
his
watch
and
then
said
it
was
time
for
them
to
return
to
their
party
so
they
all
left
their
pleasant
nook
considerably
to
their
regret
sir
ralph
stayed
beside
them
till
they
were
close
to
the
edge
of
the
wood
helping
them
to
climb
up
the
steep
rough
paths
then
he
hastened
on
before
them
saying
they
had
better
follow
at
their
leisure
soon
after
they
had
reached
the
châlet
it
became
time
to
think
of
rejoining
the
carriages
they
all
descended
the
hill
together
an
easier
managed
business
than
the
ascent
and
returned
home
as
they
came
except
that
by
lady
request
marion
took
seat
in
her
carriage
that
gentleman
occupying
her
former
place
and
was
set
down
with
archer
at
the
door
of
their
own
house
which
was
passed
on
their
way
to
the
rue

the
weeks
passed
on
quietly
and
to
outward
seeming
uneventfully
enough
cissy
and
marion
grew
so
accustomed
to
their
calm
pleasant
life
at
altes
that
save
for
occasional
home
letters
they
could
have
fancied
themselves
permanently
settled
in
the
pretty
little
southern
town
harry
wrote
frequently
and
very
cheerfully
only
bewailing
as
the
christmas
holidays
drew
nearer
that
they
must
be
spent
away
from
marion
at
rarer
intervals
there
came
paternal
epistles
from
vere
to
which
marion
always
dutifully
replied
cissy
as
her
share
had
regular
letters
from
her
husband
who
latterly
had
alluded
to
a
prospect
before
him
of
obtaining
ere
long
a
staff
appointment
in
a
part
of
the
country
sufficiently
healthy
for
his
wife
to
rejoin
him
there
without
risk
archer
was
in
great
spirits
at
this
news
and
chattered
away
about
returning
to
india
as
if
it
were
the
most
easily
managed
little
journey
in
the
world
but
marion
as
she
looked
at
her
felt
certain
vague
misgivings
she
was
not
satisfied
that
her
cousin
was
gaining
strength
from
her
sojourn
at
altes
for
at
times
she
looked
sadly
fragile
the
slightest
extra
exertion
utterly
prostrated
her
and
yet
so
buoyant
and
was
she
that
marion
found
it
impossible
to
persuade
her
to
take
more
care
of
herself
poor
little
cissy
what
a
baby
she
was
after
all
and
yet
a
difficult
baby
to
manage
with
all
her
genuine
sweet
temper
and
pretty
playfulness
governess
duties
were
faithfully
performed
and
on
the
whole
with
ease
and
satisfaction
certainly
it
was
not
all
smooth
sailing
in
this
direction
but
still
the
storms
were
rarer
and
less
important
than
might
have
been
expected
sybil
caused
her
from
time
to
time
anxiety
but
never
displeasure
lotty
on
the
other
hand
was
now
and
then
extremely
provoking
disobedient
inattentive
and
impertinent
but
marion
had
succeeded
in
gaining
the
affection
and
in
the
end
these
fits
of
haughtiness
were
sure
to
be
followed
by
repentance
genuine
though
somewhat
now
and
then
miss
vyse
favoured
the
schoolroom
party
with
her
presence
these
were
the
days
the
young
governess
dreaded
not
that
then
was
anything
in
manner
actually
to
be
complained
of
she
refrained
from
the
slightest
appearance
of
interfering
and
indeed
went
further
than
this
for
she
paraded
her
respect
for
the
governess
in
a
way
that
to
marion
was
more
offensive
than
positive
insult
or
contemptuous
neglect
she
it
was
who
always
reproved
the
refractory
lotty
for
any
sign
of
disrespect
or
inattention
lotty
she
would
say
in
an
inexpressibly
tone
can
you
be
so
forgetful
of
your
duty
to
miss
freer
remember
dear
what
your
grandmamma
was
saying
only
yesterday
i
am
sure
you
were
never
so
troublesome
with
me
when
i
helped
you
with
your
lessons
and
that
was
only
a
sort
of
you
know
now
miss
freer
is
here
on
purpose
to
teach
you
you
know
dear
you
must
be
all
of
which
of
course
further
excited
the
demon
of
opposition
and
defiance
of
her
gentle
governess
in
the
naughty
heart
florence
managed
too
to
show
that
she
came
in
a
sense
as
a
spy
on
miss
freer
little
remarks
made
as
it
were
in
all
innocence
half
questions
apologised
for
as
soon
as
uttered
in
these
and
a
hundred
other
ways
she
succeeded
in
making
marion
conscious
that
she
was
not
fully
trusted
and
far
worse
she
instilled
into
lotty
by
nature
so
generous
and
unsuspicious
a
most
unsalutary
feeling
half
of
contempt
half
of
distrust
of
the
young
governess
the
being
who
of
all
that
had
ever
come
into
contact
with
charlotte
severn
might
have
exercised
the
happiest
influence
on
the
rich
but
undisciplined
nature
marion
did
not
see
much
of
lady
severn
whose
civilities
to
archer
were
generally
of
a
kind
that
did
not
of
necessity
include
miss
freer
a
proposal
to
an
with
her
in
the
morning
before
lessons
were
over
in
the
rue
des
lauriers
or
an
invitation
to
accompany
the
dowager
in
her
very
stupid
afternoon
drive
these
and
little
attentions
she
showed
her
some
of
which
accepted
as
a
duty
though
by
no
means
a
pleasure
to
the
last
day
of
her
stay
at
altes
archer
could
not
succeed
in
making
the
deaf
lady
hear
what
she
said
without
ludicrous
and
superhuman
exertions
one
thing
in
her
daily
life
for
long
struck
marion
as
curious
she
never
by
any
chance
saw
sir
ralph
in
his
house
had
she
not
been
informed
to
the
contrary
she
would
have
imagined
he
was
not
a
member
of
the
establishment
the
children
talked
of
him
sometimes
indeed
sybil
would
never
have
tired
of
chattering
about
him
but
marion
did
not
encourage
it
much
chattering
would
effectually
interfered
with
lessons
and
besides
this
the
had
of
late
begun
to
suspect
that
her
discretion
in
this
could
not
be
carried
too
far
as
she
had
a
sort
of
instinctive
fear
that
all
or
a
great
part
of
the
schoolroom
conversation
was
extracted
from
lotty
by
miss
vyse
not
that
she
cared
about
the
thing
itself
though
the
feeling
of
a
spy
in
the
camp
is
not
a
pleasant
one
even
to
the
most
candid
and
innocent
and
in
her
present
position
marion
could
not
feel
herself
invulnerable
but
it
was
very
trying
to
her
trying
and
almost
sickening
to
see
the
sweet
gradually
melting
away
out
of
nature
she
thought
it
better
to
say
very
little
about
the
children
to
sir
ralph
when
she
met
him
in
house
and
indeed
he
by
no
means
encouraged
her
doing
so
the
mention
of
her
employment
always
appeared
so
to
annoy
him
that
at
last
it
came
to
be
tacitly
avoided
and
really
for
the
time
being
forgotten
for
they
were
at
no
loss
for
things
to
talk
about
those
three
in
the
afternoons
generally
one
or
two
a
week
that
sir
ralph
spent
in
pleasant
afternoons
they
were
to
him
indeed
there
could
be
no
doubt
of
their
being
so
as
otherwise
he
would
not
have
thus
sought
them
voluntarily
he
took
care
however
never
to
come
on
a
friday
sophy
chatter
dora
silliness
and
ponderous
platitudes
all
at
one
time
in
one
little
room
would
really
he
declared
irreverently
have
been
too
much
fox
him
so
said
cissy
like
a
man
you
leave
us
poor
weak
women
to
endure
as
best
we
may
what
you
confess
would
be
beyond
your
archer
he
replied
not
fair
at
all
one
meat
is
another
i
suppose
your
of
friends
is
disagreeable
to
you
as
to
speak
plainly
you
have
yourself
to
thank
for
it
if
you
want
to
see
all
these
people
what
do
you
ask
them
for
never
said
i
want
to
see
them
said
illogical
cissy
only
said
you
might
come
and
help
me
to
entertain
them
besides
added
she
mischievously
marion
she
ask
them
so
not
to
blame
for
the
infliction
if
such
it
be
you
might
come
to
help
her
to
get
through
the
use
i
should
be
he
said
lightly
and
then
went
on
more
seriously
do
you
know
archer
i
am
really
busy
just
what
about
she
asked
coolly
things
that
you
would
think
very
stupid
hunting
up
specimens
of
the
old
language
and
dialects
once
spoken
about
here
doing
it
for
a
friend
who
is
taking
up
the
subject
should
think
that
very
interesting
work
said
marion
indeed
he
replied
warmly
interesting
is
no
word
for
it
it
has
quite
reconciled
me
to
spending
the
winter
here
a
prospect
that
was
dreadful
enough
to
few
months
ago
i
can
assure
just
at
that
moment
charlie
appeared
with
a
whispered
message
to
his
mother
who
thereupon
left
the
room
saying
as
she
did
so
that
she
would
return
in
a
few
minutes
and
that
in
the
meantime
sir
ralph
might
amuse
himself
and
marion
by
giving
her
some
specimens
of
the
ancient
language
he
was
so
interested
in
charlie
followed
his
mother
but
stopped
for
a
moment
as
he
reached
the
door
to
announce
in
a
stage
whisper
with
a
confidential
nod
only
the
dressmaker
which
piece
of
impertinence
was
audibly
punished
by
a
box
on
the
ear
from
his
indignant
mamma
your
name
miss
name
marion
i
with
an
a
or
an
o
asked
sir
ralph
somewhat
irrelevantly
it
appeared
to
the
young
lady
an
o
she
replied
i
fancied
so
he
said
with
satisfaction
archer
told
me
to
amuse
you
with
specimens
of
the
old
dialects
just
now
but
she
would
be
surprised
if
i
told
her
that
there
is
an
old
song
old
though
not
ancient
actually
dedicated
to
a
lady
who
must
have
borne
your
there
really
exclaimed
marion
had
no
idea
my
name
was
to
be
found
anywhere
out
of
england
or
great
britain
i
should
say
for
there
are
plenty
of
scotch
marions
oh
tell
me
about
the
song
sir
ralph
or
can
you
show
it
to
me
is
it
pretty
and
has
it
been
set
to
music
has
been
set
to
music
and
i
think
it
very
pretty
he
replied
could
show
it
to
you
for
i
have
both
copied
it
and
translated
it
but
i
show
it
you
just
now
indeed
i
am
not
sure
that
it
would
not
please
you
more
if
i
gave
it
to
some
one
else
to
show
he
looked
at
her
closely
as
he
spoke
but
she
only
appeared
puzzled
you
gave
it
to
some
one
else
to
show
me
she
repeated
understand
what
you
mean
sir
ralph
really
i
you
said
he
again
and
really
he
spoke
as
it
were
in
jest
and
yet
something
in
his
voice
sounded
as
if
he
were
in
earnest
again
miss
freer
though
you
may
never
have
seen
this
little
song
you
may
easily
enough
fancy
that
pretty
and
simple
as
it
is
there
was
only
one
person
who
could
have
ventured
to
address
it
to
the
marion
of
those
days
without
fear
of
its
being
scornfully
rejected
that
marion
must
have
been
young
and
fair
but
there
are
others
as
young
and
as
fair
and
there
are
knights
too
gallant
enough
though
not
exactly
cast
in
the
mould
of
the
ones
you
see
miss
freer
i
should
not
like
my
poor
little
song
to
be
scorned
i
would
rather
keep
it
till
the
true
knight
passes
this
way
and
i
am
anxious
he
stopped
at
a
loss
to
finish
his
sentence
half
ashamed
indeed
of
having
said
so
much
marion
had
listened
quietly
no
sign
of
displeasure
in
her
face
but
an
expression
of
slight
bewilderment
and
somewhat
too
of
sadness
overspread
it
ralph
she
said
say
again
i
know
what
you
are
talking
about
but
truly
i
may
say
i
know
whom
you
are
referring
to
you
wish
to
vex
me
i
know
if
even
there
is
anything
you
wish
to
warn
me
about
i
am
sure
you
would
do
it
most
gently
and
kindly
i
am
not
very
old
and
i
daresay
not
very
wise
she
added
with
a
smile
truly
i
quite
understand
no
knight
as
you
call
it
is
likely
to
pass
this
way
on
my
she
spoke
so
earnestly
and
simply
that
ralph
all
but
moved
out
of
his
habitual
looked
up
again
with
the
look
over
his
face
freer
he
began
eagerly
and
still
more
eager
words
were
on
his
lips
door
opened
and
in
walked
with
the
air
of
one
thoroughly
at
home
and
sure
of
a
welcome
frank
berwick
it
was
not
the
first
time
pleasant
afternoons
had
been
interrupted
by
this
young
gentleman
he
rose
the
bright
look
utterly
gone
from
his
face
shook
hands
with
frank
and
archer
shortly
after
returning
to
the
room
seized
the
first
opportunity
of
taking
leave
of
the
little
party
as
he
bade
to
marion
he
said
in
a
low
voice
heard
by
her
only
me
miss
freer
for
what
i
said
i
must
have
seemed
very
impertinent
but
truly
i
did
not
mean
to
be
so
remember
how
many
years
older
i
am
than
you
and
let
that
prevent
your
thinking
me
unpardonably
marion
said
nothing
but
for
one
half
instant
raised
her
eyes
to
his
face
with
a
curious
expression
part
deprecating
part
reproachful
the
sort
of
look
one
sees
in
the
face
of
a
child
who
has
been
scolded
for
a
fault
which
it
does
not
feel
conscious
of
or
understand
then
she
said
or
indeed
was
it
only
his
fancy
the
words
were
so
faint
and
low
little
you
understand
me
when
ralph
left
house
he
did
not
turn
towards
the
rue
des
lauriers
but
walked
briskly
in
the
opposite
direction
like
many
other
men
he
had
a
habit
when
perplexed
or
annoyed
of
it
out
of
himself
as
he
would
have
called
it
by
sharp
physical
exercise
not
till
he
was
some
way
out
of
the
town
in
a
quiet
country
lane
did
he
slacken
his
pace
and
begin
steadily
to
a
weak
fool
i
am
after
all
can
it
really
be
that
after
all
these
years
i
now
that
i
am
for
is
more
than
for
men
like
me
have
caught
the
strange
infection
hitherto
so
incomprehensible
to
me
what
is
there
about
this
girl
this
marion
that
utterly
changes
me
when
in
her
presence
oh
madness
and
folly
are
no
words
for
what
i
was
nearly
doing
just
now
who
of
all
men
in
the
world
am
least
fitted
have
indeed
least
right
to
marry
lucky
it
was
that
that
boy
berwick
came
in
when
he
did
not
after
all
that
it
would
have
mattered
much
she
could
not
care
or
ever
learn
to
care
for
me
but
the
thing
might
have
distressed
her
all
the
same
and
increased
the
discomfort
of
her
position
how
odious
it
is
to
think
of
her
trudging
backwards
and
forwards
every
morning
as
a
daily
governess
and
that
hateful
florence
sneering
at
and
insulting
her
in
her
way
at
this
point
he
stopped
short
in
his
meditations
and
laughed
at
himself
i
am
too
absurd
now
to
be
reasonable
about
it
what
shall
i
do
so
far
surely
i
am
not
so
very
far
gone
no
necessity
for
my
running
away
from
altes
and
before
long
i
have
very
little
doubt
the
temptation
will
be
beyond
my
reach
for
of
young
intentions
i
have
not
the
shadow
of
a
doubt
he
is
not
a
bad
fellow
by
any
means
and
will
make
a
fair
enough
husband
i
dare
say
not
good
enough
for
her
of
course
but
then
the
way
in
such
things
besides
going
out
to
india
with
him
is
suppose
a
preferable
lot
to
being
a
governess
at
home
but
i
hope
his
people
will
treat
her
properly
my
poor
little
girl
but
what
right
have
i
to
even
think
of
her
so
ah
after
all
if
things
had
been
different
thus
he
thought
to
himself
as
he
slowly
walked
homewards
turning
the
thing
round
and
round
in
his
mind
and
looking
at
it
from
all
sides
finally
deciding
that
all
he
could
do
was
gradually
to
dismiss
this
wild
dream
from
his
mind
not
realizing
in
his
inexperience
that
in
such
matters
it
is
hearts
not
minds
we
have
to
deal
with
and
so
far
as
possible
forget
that
it
had
ever
visited
him
as
no
one
but
himself
was
involved
no
happiness
or
suffering
in
question
but
his
own
he
decided
he
need
not
absent
himself
from
altes
for
a
little
as
had
been
his
first
impulse
on
making
this
extraordinary
discovery
not
at
least
at
present
but
he
would
be
careful
he
would
not
lay
up
for
himself
unnecessary
perplexity
or
suffering
for
after
all
his
belief
in
his
own
had
received
a
great
shock
so
he
resolved
and
acted
upon
his
resolution
by
not
calling
at
till
the
next
week
when
trusting
to
the
safety
which
we
are
told
lies
in
numbers
he
purposely
chose
a
friday
for
his
visit
it
was
disagreeable
as
he
had
anticipated
and
indeed
almost
hoped
it
would
be
the
day
being
chilly
none
of
friends
ventured
out
on
the
terrace
and
the
small
was
therefore
rather
crowded
there
was
the
usual
set
the
bailey
girls
chepstow
and
monsieur
de
the
frasers
and
sophy
berwick
accompanied
of
course
by
her
brother
erbenfeld
was
there
too
amusing
himself
by
trying
to
get
up
a
flirtation
with
archer
by
no
means
an
easy
undertaking
as
he
found
to
his
cost
for
quick
wit
and
unaffected
utter
indifference
to
his
graceful
compliments
and
sentimental
allusions
baffled
him
far
more
effectively
than
any
affectation
of
matronly
dignity
or
the
most
freezing
airs
of
propriety
it
was
really
rather
amusing
to
watch
for
erbenfeld
was
clever
enough
in
his
shallow
way
and
evidently
quite
unaccustomed
to
have
his
flattering
attentions
thus
smilingly
rejected
ralph
had
not
been
there
two
minutes
before
he
began
to
wish
himself
away
but
he
had
resolved
to
say
or
so
to
avoid
the
appearance
of
any
marked
change
and
so
he
sat
on
patiently
thinking
to
himself
it
was
no
bad
discipline
for
his
powers
of
to
sit
there
trying
to
talk
nonsense
to
sophy
berwick
all
the
time
that
he
was
intensely
conscious
or
near
presence
at
the
piano
where
she
was
eagerly
examining
sonic
new
music
which
frank
had
just
brought
her
the
giver
of
course
standing
close
by
replying
to
her
remarks
with
a
bright
smile
on
his
handsome
face
suddenly
some
one
proposed
that
they
should
have
a
little
music
the
glee
party
collected
round
the
piano
and
went
through
their
little
performances
successfully
enough
this
over
there
was
an
exhibition
of
instrumental
music
from
one
or
two
of
the
young
ladies
in
the
moving
about
the
room
that
ensued
ralph
found
himself
for
the
first
time
that
afternoon
near
marion
in
his
nervous
hurry
to
say
something
he
of
course
said
about
the
stupidest
thing
he
could
have
chosen
you
sing
miss
freer
she
looked
up
at
him
with
surprise
but
when
she
saw
the
perfect
good
faith
in
which
he
had
asked
the
question
she
began
to
laugh
in
spite
of
herself
said
she
think
i
have
told
you
before
that
i
sing
a
little
and
if
you
had
been
listening
you
would
have
heard
me
singing
just
you
singing
he
said
i
did
not
know
certainly
i
would
have
listened
had
i
known
it
was
you
i
was
thinking
the
other
day
how
odd
it
was
i
had
never
heard
you
was
not
singing
alone
just
now
she
said
more
seriously
only
took
a
part
in
those
he
replied
it
was
not
bad
of
me
after
all
but
i
should
very
much
like
to
hear
you
sing
alone
when
miss
bailey
finishes
this
affair
she
is
playing
will
you
sing
miss
freer
yes
if
you
like
she
answered
lightly
but
in
a
moment
a
thought
struck
her
and
she
added
mischievously
would
you
like
me
to
sing
sir
ralph
is
there
any
song
you
think
would
suit
me
he
replied
in
the
same
tone
but
as
at
this
moment
miss
twirlings
and
twitchings
suddenly
ceased
and
as
marion
rose
he
said
in
a
lower
voice
in
particular
but
i
give
it
she
seemed
as
if
she
hardly
heard
him
and
at
a
sign
from
cissy
took
place
at
the
piano
her
voice
was
certainly
not
a
very
powerful
one
but
neither
could
it
be
called
weak
it
was
true
and
sweet
but
its
chief
beauty
was
its
exceeding
freshness
clear
and
bright
and
yet
with
an
of
almost
wild
plaintiveness
the
sort
of
voice
one
would
be
inclined
to
describe
as
more
like
a
young
than
a
it
made
one
think
of
a
bunch
of
spring
field
flowers
freshly
gathered
and
sparkling
with
dew
so
at
least
ralph
fancied
as
he
listened
and
went
on
in
his
own
mind
to
compare
florence
rich
contralto
to
a
perfectly
arranged
group
of
brilliantly
coloured
and
heavily
scented
exotics
the
simile
was
not
however
a
perfect
one
for
it
did
not
sufficiently
express
the
tenderness
and
cultivated
refinement
of
singing
what
her
song
was
ralph
did
not
know
nor
care
it
was
german
so
much
he
discovered
and
some
words
reached
him
which
sounded
like
these
ist
verronnen
meine
a
sort
of
sorrowful
refrain
they
seemed
to
him
and
they
set
his
thoughts
off
again
in
the
direction
of
wishing
they
were
less
true
as
applied
to
himself
but
he
pulled
himself
up
short
thanked
miss
freer
quietly
said
good
bye
to
archer
and
her
guests
and
was
just
about
to
take
his
departure
when
the
door
opened
and
severn
and
miss
were
announced
by
whose
mistress
very
goodnaturedly
lent
him
to
archer
on
fridays
it
was
rather
annoying
ralph
so
seldom
called
on
any
lady
that
his
presence
here
could
not
but
surprise
his
mother
however
it
was
much
better
than
if
the
worthy
lady
had
taken
it
into
her
head
to
call
on
archer
on
one
of
the
several
afternoons
he
had
spent
in
the
company
only
of
cissy
and
her
guest
he
made
the
best
of
the
situation
gratified
florence
by
asking
if
they
had
a
seat
to
spare
in
the
carriage
in
which
case
he
would
wait
and
return
home
with
them
and
altogether
made
himself
so
sociable
and
agreeable
that
lady
severn
began
to
think
with
pleased
astonishment
that
after
all
her
unsatisfactory
ralph
had
inherited
something
of
the
affability
so
all
seemed
smooth
and
smiling
but
for
all
that
florence
had
her
eyes
open
that
afternoon
and
bitter
thoughts
were
in
her
heart
as
they
bowled
home
to
the
rue
des
lauriers
though
the
words
on
her
lips
were
honeyed
and
soft
a
few
days
after
this
the
second
of
the
altes
balls
took
place
archer
and
her
cousin
had
not
gone
to
the
first
as
on
the
day
it
was
held
the
former
had
not
been
well
enough
to
risk
the
fatigue
but
having
been
or
fancied
herself
stronger
of
late
she
was
bent
on
attending
the
forthcoming
one
marion
had
no
objection
to
accompanying
her
save
her
former
fear
of
appearing
inconsistent
but
this
time
cissy
was
not
to
be
moved
marion
was
to
go
to
the
ball
attired
in
the
prettiest
of
dresses
and
for
this
one
evening
to
enjoy
herself
thoroughly
and
forget
all
about
that
so
the
girl
yielded
not
unwillingly
i
dare
say
they
arranged
to
go
with
the
berwicks
frank
and
sophy
warmly
applauding
determination
that
miss
freer
should
make
one
of
the
party
course
you
should
come
said
sophy
should
think
it
bad
enough
to
have
to
be
shut
up
all
the
morning
with
those
brats
without
thinking
it
necessary
on
that
account
to
forego
a
pleasant
way
or
spending
an
well
replied
marion
once
in
a
way
i
daresay
there
can
be
no
objection
to
in
a
way
repeated
sophy
is
absurd
to
hear
you
a
girl
ever
so
much
younger
than
i
talking
like
that
you
mean
to
remain
a
governess
all
your
life
do
you
miss
freer
marion
felt
and
looked
rather
annoyed
at
this
not
very
inquiry
but
before
she
had
time
to
reply
cissy
who
was
present
at
the
time
came
to
the
rescue
course
not
miss
berwick
she
exclaimed
rather
indignantly
but
on
catching
a
beseeching
look
from
marion
she
changed
her
tone
and
added
half
laughingly
you
know
miss
berwick
that
marion
is
going
out
with
me
next
spring
to
marry
a
nabob
whom
she
has
never
seen
a
real
nabob
i
assure
you
as
rich
i
should
like
to
be
and
saying
a
good
deal
i
assure
you
by
this
time
next
year
imagine
miss
freer
converted
into
nabob
with
more
fine
dresses
and
diamonds
than
she
knows
what
to
do
with
what
a
charming
prospect
i
hope
you
will
remember
may
to
give
me
some
of
your
can
you
be
so
silly
cissy
said
marion
half
laughing
and
half
annoyed
sophy
looked
curious
and
mystified
she
could
not
make
out
how
much
was
fun
and
how
much
earliest
of
announcement
miss
silly
very
probably
only
applied
to
her
exaggerated
way
of
telling
it
it
was
quite
possible
sophy
decided
that
the
young
lady
was
in
fact
engaged
to
some
rich
indian
and
was
only
a
daily
governess
for
a
short
time
perhaps
to
make
some
money
towards
providing
a
trousseau
being
of
a
more
independent
spirit
than
some
brides
elect
in
similar
circumstances
it
seemed
rather
a
plausible
way
of
accounting
for
the
mystery
which
even
sophy
whose
perceptions
were
not
of
the
acutest
felt
there
existed
about
this
girl
she
would
have
uncommonly
liked
to
hear
reason
but
was
not
bold
enough
to
make
further
inquiries
besides
which
marion
evidently
wished
the
subject
to
be
dropped
and
sophy
would
have
been
really
sorry
to
annoy
her
so
no
more
was
said
but
as
sophy
was
leaving
marion
accompanied
her
to
the
door
and
said
to
her
earnestly
but
in
a
low
voice
berwick
will
you
be
so
good
as
not
to
think
anything
of
what
archer
said
today
i
mean
will
you
please
not
to
talk
about
it
you
know
how
exceedingly
it
would
annoy
me
if
any
reports
were
spread
about
me
if
indeed
i
were
spoken
about
at
all
it
would
vex
me
for
it
might
cause
much
miss
freer
i
be
the
one
to
spread
reports
about
you
replied
sophy
like
you
far
too
much
to
wish
to
annoy
you
you
may
depend
upon
my
you
said
marion
looking
more
comfortable
for
she
saw
that
sophy
meant
what
she
said
still
it
was
not
very
wise
of
her
to
have
made
this
appeal
to
sophy
it
only
impressed
upon
the
thoughtless
memory
what
otherwise
she
would
probably
have
soon
forgotten
marion
returned
to
the
intending
to
scold
cissy
but
the
naughty
bird
was
flown
this
was
the
day
of
the
ball
head
was
full
if
her
own
and
toilettes
in
justice
to
her
it
must
be
said
her
young
appearance
interested
her
quite
a
much
as
if
not
more
than
her
own
the
result
in
both
eases
was
eminently
satisfactory
cissy
always
pretty
showed
to
advantage
in
a
and
marion
was
at
the
age
when
a
girl
must
be
plain
indeed
not
to
look
bright
and
sweet
in
a
robe
of
floating
cloudy
white
here
and
there
dotted
with
rosebuds
of
as
delicate
a
tint
as
the
unaccustomed
flush
on
the
cheeks
marion
was
far
from
plain
and
would
but
ill
have
expressed
what
ralph
severn
thought
of
her
as
almost
immediately
on
his
arrival
in
the
room
he
caught
sight
of
her
not
dancing
but
sitting
quietly
beside
old
berwick
cissy
not
far
off
ralph
had
come
as
a
duty
because
his
mother
had
desired
it
he
had
been
present
at
the
previous
ball
for
the
same
reason
and
had
spent
a
most
disagreeable
evening
he
hated
dancing
or
fancied
he
did
for
he
danced
well
and
judges
in
such
matters
say
that
no
one
who
hates
this
can
ever
be
a
proficient
therein
however
this
may
have
been
he
certainly
did
most
devoutly
hate
dancing
with
miss
vyse
which
to
his
dismay
he
found
himself
expected
to
do
to
a
considerable
extent
so
his
previous
experience
having
been
the
reverse
of
reassuring
he
with
fear
and
trembling
for
the
second
time
prepared
to
obey
the
maternal
commands
he
entered
the
room
hating
himself
and
everybody
else
in
plain
english
not
in
the
sweetest
of
tempers
but
one
glance
in
a
certain
direction
one
glimpse
of
a
white
dress
and
blush
rosebuds
one
view
of
a
graceful
little
head
round
which
the
bright
brown
hair
was
wound
in
thick
smooth
coils
and
the
whole
scene
was
changed
to
him
and
yet
but
a
few
days
before
he
had
calmly
decided
that
this
dream
of
his
was
but
a
dream
a
passing
fancy
that
he
could
easily
overcome
and
ere
long
forget
a
strange
reaction
came
over
him
this
evening
from
being
unusually
gloomy
and
morose
he
suddenly
became
in
the
opposite
extreme
and
as
he
could
be
in
rare
excitement
brilliantly
lively
and
amusing
he
delighted
and
amazed
florence
by
dancing
with
her
twice
in
succession
waltzing
as
she
told
him
this
duty
over
and
having
seen
his
fair
charm
engaged
to
the
end
of
her
card
he
found
himself
free
to
saunter
up
the
room
yes
there
she
was
still
sitting
she
had
not
danced
yet
then
how
could
that
be
a
friendly
greeting
from
archer
a
few
words
of
commonplace
small
talk
and
he
turned
to
marion
you
not
been
dancing
miss
freer
yet
she
answered
smiling
am
engaged
for
two
or
three
dances
further
on
but
you
know
i
have
not
a
great
many
acquaintances
as
she
spoke
erbenfeld
came
up
eagerly
to
archer
whom
he
immediately
began
urging
to
break
her
resolution
of
not
dancing
as
his
glance
fell
upon
marion
he
bowed
to
her
in
the
very
stiffest
and
slightest
manner
you
dance
this
with
me
miss
freer
asked
sir
ralph
it
is
i
know
but
it
really
and
as
she
rose
and
took
his
arm
and
they
walked
away
he
added
have
you
done
to
offend
that
said
marion
think
you
he
asked
i
am
a
governess
she
answered
simply
freer
he
said
earnestly
vex
me
by
that
sort
of
thing
i
insult
you
by
supposing
for
an
instant
that
you
mind
any
vulgar
insolence
of
that
kind
but
it
hurts
me
for
you
to
seem
conscious
of
it
please
put
all
that
nonsense
aside
i
am
in
a
very
good
humour
which
you
must
know
is
a
rare
occurrence
and
deserves
to
be
commemorated
so
i
am
going
to
enjoy
myself
and
you
must
do
the
assure
you
i
intend
to
do
so
she
said
please
remember
it
was
you
not
i
that
took
any
notice
of
forgive
me
for
having
done
so
said
he
now
tell
me
what
is
your
idea
of
enjoying
yourself
shall
we
dance
this
or
find
a
comfortable
corner
for
it
out
should
like
to
dance
this
said
she
you
mind
said
he
but
the
one
little
word
held
a
good
deal
so
they
danced
and
enjoy
it
marion
being
young
enough
and
ralph
not
so
old
after
all
as
he
fancied
he
found
his
views
on
various
subjects
undergoing
a
curious
change
this
evening
dancing
and
its
attendants
no
longer
seemed
to
him
so
utterly
insane
and
ridiculous
as
he
had
hitherto
considered
them
the
music
was
really
very
good
the
floor
capital
and
some
of
the
dresses
exceedingly
pretty
marion
was
amused
at
his
expressions
of
satisfaction
really
must
be
in
a
very
good
humour
sir
ralph
said
she
else
you
have
hitherto
belied
yourself
i
always
understood
you
detested
i
do
in
general
he
replied
one
is
an
exception
do
you
care
about
such
things
miss
freer
answered
marion
think
i
do
not
exceedingly
perhaps
as
some
girls
do
but
then
my
life
has
been
different
i
have
no
mother
or
sister
and
i
have
lived
very
much
out
of
the
you
are
not
an
orphan
he
asked
hesitatingly
father
is
alive
he
is
a
clergyman
i
think
is
he
not
and
before
his
mind
rose
a
picture
of
the
struggling
curate
and
the
unluxurious
home
in
which
this
girl
had
probably
been
reared
though
how
under
such
circumstances
she
had
come
to
be
what
she
was
was
a
mystery
beyond
his
powers
to
fathom
they
were
sitting
in
a
quiet
corner
and
as
he
spoke
face
was
full
in
his
view
she
was
looking
down
but
as
he
asked
these
questions
he
distinctly
saw
her
colour
change
as
it
rarely
did
there
was
a
change
too
in
her
voice
as
she
replied
my
father
is
not
a
clergyman
but
then
she
stopped
and
hesitated
thought
ralph
is
something
worse
than
poverty
here
she
is
not
a
girl
to
be
ashamed
of
anything
but
real
and
there
was
a
deepened
tenderness
in
his
tone
as
he
quickly
tried
to
set
her
at
ease
by
instantly
changing
the
subject
she
felt
it
how
grateful
she
was
how
gladly
at
that
moment
would
she
have
agreed
to
be
indeed
miss
freer
the
poor
little
governess
able
to
answer
his
kindly
questions
with
perfect
frankness
with
no
secret
from
this
man
whom
already
she
was
learning
to
trust
more
than
any
other
on
earth
a
sudden
impulse
seized
her
to
tell
the
truth
but
the
words
died
on
her
lips
as
she
thought
to
herself
what
might
be
the
results
of
her
betraying
her
secret
in
all
probability
she
and
not
only
she
but
cissy
too
would
for
ever
forfeit
his
respect
what
might
he
not
think
it
right
to
do
possibly
to
write
to
her
father
in
which
case
all
she
had
striven
for
would
be
lost
and
harry
after
all
disgraced
sir
ralph
at
the
best
would
feel
obliged
to
tell
all
to
lady
severn
and
would
naturally
be
indignant
at
the
trick
that
had
been
played
her
the
story
would
get
wind
and
would
spread
beyond
altes
for
father
was
too
much
of
a
public
character
for
his
daughter
to
masquerade
with
impunity
all
this
flashed
through
her
mind
in
an
instant
and
arrested
the
words
on
her
lips
ralph
saw
that
she
was
nervous
and
uneasy
and
blamed
himself
for
having
turned
her
thoughts
in
an
evidently
painful
direction
he
tried
to
gain
her
attention
to
amuse
her
but
in
vain
at
last
he
stopped
and
laid
his
hand
gently
on
her
arm
marion
started
freer
said
he
see
i
have
spoilt
your
pleasure
by
my
inconsiderate
talk
most
unintentionally
poor
child
i
have
brought
back
to
your
mind
sorrows
and
anxieties
which
i
would
give
more
than
i
can
express
to
banish
far
from
you
not
for
one
short
evening
but
for
ever
i
am
so
angry
with
myself
that
i
bear
the
reproach
of
your
sad
face
you
forgive
me
and
look
happy
again
believe
me
i
am
the
last
man
on
earth
to
pry
into
another
private
concerns
unless
indeed
i
could
do
anything
to
help
you
are
very
very
good
and
kind
replied
marion
and
i
truly
did
not
mean
to
look
reproachful
no
thank
you
you
help
me
in
any
way
after
a
while
things
will
come
you
are
patient
as
well
as
brave
said
he
with
a
smile
do
you
know
i
am
either
asked
she
he
began
eagerly
but
slackened
a
little
as
he
went
on
evidently
changing
what
he
was
going
to
have
said
i
have
seen
you
in
peculiar
circumstances
which
have
called
for
both
and
you
have
not
think
better
of
me
than
i
deserve
said
marion
in
all
sincerity
though
the
phrase
she
had
used
is
seldom
so
uttered
fear
if
you
knew
all
about
me
you
would
greatly
change
your
thoughts
of
me
i
fear
you
would
she
repeated
half
questioningly
and
as
she
spoke
she
laid
her
hand
on
his
arm
and
looked
up
in
his
face
with
a
sort
of
wistful
appeal
she
did
it
in
all
simplicity
poor
child
somehow
her
secret
weighed
heavily
on
her
that
evening
and
oh
how
she
wished
she
could
tell
him
the
whole
ralph
did
not
speak
for
a
moment
then
as
if
in
spite
of
himself
he
said
hoarsely
almost
do
not
try
me
too
but
before
another
word
could
be
said
by
either
voice
was
heard
behind
them
how
ever
have
you
and
sir
ralph
managed
to
hide
yourselves
i
have
had
such
a
hunt
for
you
poor
captain
berwick
in
such
a
state
at
having
lost
one
of
his
dances
you
know
you
promised
him
the
first
two
when
he
came
and
he
get
here
sooner
do
come
sir
ralph
pray
bring
her
hack
to
the
dancing
room
thank
you
who
was
her
cavalier
always
tumbling
ralph
escorted
marion
back
to
the
dancers
at
the
entrance
to
the
room
to
be
relieved
of
his
charge
by
frank
berwick
radiant
with
eagerness
and
murmuring
gentle
reproaches
to
the
truant
partner
as
he
led
her
away
to
redeem
her
promise
it
seemed
to
ralph
that
they
danced
together
all
the
rest
of
the
evening
for
he
hardly
let
them
out
of
his
sight
though
he
spoke
to
neither
again
till
the
very
close
then
as
frank
with
a
face
that
to
so
acute
an
observer
as
ralph
severn
would
had
he
been
less
preoccupied
have
told
its
own
tale
was
leading
marion
to
the
she
heard
herself
addressed
there
were
several
people
crowding
round
where
they
stood
but
ralph
made
his
way
near
enough
for
her
to
hear
him
though
he
spoke
low
freer
he
said
am
going
to
leave
altes
for
some
weeks
months
perhaps
will
you
say
to
me
to
leave
altes
repeated
marion
with
a
quiver
in
her
voice
which
he
did
not
hear
or
if
he
did
set
it
down
to
a
different
cause
away
sir
ralph
you
for
being
so
kind
to
last
words
were
very
low
if
only
he
had
looked
at
her
had
seen
the
tears
welling
up
and
all
but
running
over
but
no
he
looked
resolutely
aside
only
wrung
the
soft
little
hand
and
repeated
again
it
was
all
marion
could
do
to
keep
from
crying
right
out
in
the
dark
carriage
on
the
way
home
she
had
had
enough
to
excite
and
distress
her
that
evening
and
might
well
have
been
excused
had
her
failed
her
at
last
only
the
knowledge
that
cissy
would
discover
her
tears
as
soon
as
she
reached
home
enabled
her
to
keep
them
back
till
alone
in
her
little
room
chapter
x
a
sudden
recall
that
spectre
for
three
years
it
followed
me
up
and
down
the
dark
staircase
or
stood
by
my
bed
only
the
blessed
light
had
power
to
exorcise
a
revelation
of
childhood
jameson
way
madness
king
lear
it
was
quite
true
she
had
not
misunderstood
what
he
said
sir
ralph
for
reasons
best
known
to
himself
left
altes
the
next
day
for
an
indefinite
time
it
seemed
to
marion
that
there
had
been
something
prophetic
in
his
calling
her
and
she
needed
at
this
time
to
be
both
and
she
succeeded
poor
child
in
her
endeavour
to
act
up
to
his
opinion
of
her
day
after
day
the
appointed
hour
saw
her
in
the
schoolroom
doing
her
very
best
with
her
pupils
bearing
with
tempers
and
poor
little
moods
and
no
one
not
even
cissy
suspected
that
she
had
even
these
to
bear
far
less
the
deeper
though
hardly
even
to
herself
acknowledged
it
which
you
will
the
magnitude
of
which
unconsciously
swallowed
up
the
lesser
daily
irritations
it
was
not
merely
a
sorrow
a
loss
a
something
gone
out
of
her
life
which
she
had
not
known
was
there
till
she
missed
it
it
was
more
than
these
she
was
mortified
ashamed
of
having
given
her
regard
she
would
call
it
by
no
more
tender
name
even
to
herself
unasked
for
strange
words
and
manner
she
in
her
morbid
now
explained
as
entirely
traceable
to
his
generous
pity
for
her
pity
in
the
first
place
for
her
dependent
position
and
secondly
ah
how
it
wounded
her
to
think
so
for
her
unmaidenly
because
unsought
and
unreturned
revelation
of
her
for
him
how
extraordinarily
people
misunderstand
each
other
thus
she
was
thinking
and
suffering
at
the
very
time
that
ralph
was
repeating
to
himself
over
and
over
again
no
possible
circumstances
had
there
been
no
shadow
of
a
rival
in
the
field
could
that
bright
sweet
being
have
learnt
to
care
for
a
soured
in
every
way
unattractive
man
like
me
at
this
period
i
think
could
marion
have
been
assured
that
such
were
feelings
for
her
she
would
have
looked
upon
permanent
separation
from
him
as
a
comparatively
small
trial
for
mortification
of
this
kind
are
very
hard
upon
a
sensitive
girl
only
i
could
think
he
did
not
despise
me
she
said
to
herself
it
never
occurred
to
her
that
so
far
as
least
as
ralph
himself
was
concerned
her
being
a
governess
might
have
in
any
way
have
influenced
him
she
was
too
unpractical
to
realize
the
possibility
of
this
or
was
it
perhaps
the
instinctive
trust
one
genuine
noble
nature
feels
in
a
kindred
spirit
for
marion
had
been
quick
to
perceive
contempt
and
miss
condescending
insolence
but
time
wore
on
as
it
always
does
through
the
weariest
weeks
as
through
roughest
christmas
came
and
went
january
far
advanced
and
marion
began
to
think
indeed
she
was
never
to
see
ralph
severn
again
for
cissy
still
spoke
of
the
not
as
the
probable
date
of
her
return
to
india
april
had
been
originally
mentioned
as
the
limit
of
their
stay
at
altes
but
before
then
she
heard
from
the
children
the
severn
household
was
to
be
removed
to
switzerland
for
the
summer
sybil
sometimes
spoke
of
her
uncle
he
had
been
in
london
for
the
last
month
she
said
and
then
two
or
three
days
after
with
great
delight
she
showed
marion
a
letter
he
had
sent
her
from
paris
dated
from
the
hôtel
de
where
he
said
he
was
going
to
stay
a
week
or
two
after
that
perhaps
he
will
come
home
here
said
sybil
sybil
said
lotty
hastily
not
at
all
certain
he
may
perhaps
not
return
to
altes
at
all
what
do
you
know
about
it
like
to
know
she
spoke
roughly
and
rudely
and
sybil
began
to
cry
marion
checked
lofty
and
desired
her
to
attend
to
her
lessons
and
not
interfere
with
her
sister
then
she
tried
to
soothe
sybil
but
it
was
difficult
to
do
so
of
late
the
child
had
seemed
far
from
well
her
timidity
and
nervousness
had
increased
to
a
painful
extent
and
marion
felt
strangely
anxious
and
uneasy
about
her
more
than
ever
she
felt
persuaded
that
some
unhappy
influence
was
injuriously
affecting
the
child
though
in
what
it
consisted
or
how
it
was
exercised
she
was
utterly
unable
to
conjecture
this
morning
lotty
happened
to
be
sent
for
by
her
grandmother
a
few
moments
after
receiving
her
reproof
for
her
roughness
to
sybil
when
left
alone
with
the
poor
little
girl
still
sobbing
piteously
marion
again
tried
to
soothe
her
she
took
her
on
her
knee
and
spoke
kind
loving
words
while
she
kissed
and
caressed
the
throbbing
brow
and
cheeks
my
darling
she
said
and
leave
off
crying
it
will
make
your
head
ache
so
lotty
did
not
mean
to
be
unkind
she
only
spoke
thoughtlessly
as
she
does
but
you
must
not
mind
it
so
very
sybil
clung
to
her
more
closely
and
tried
to
check
her
sobs
as
she
answered
lofty
crying
about
dear
miss
freer
thinking
uncle
ralph
coming
sure
to
come
back
before
long
dear
said
marion
lotty
only
said
he
perhaps
coming
just
but
i
want
him
so
much
said
sybil
very
much
i
was
thinking
i
would
tell
him
i
tell
any
one
about
dear
asked
marion
gently
you
will
tell
me
perhaps
i
can
help
you
answered
sybil
i
tell
you
i
said
i
and
it
might
hurt
you
i
mean
ever
to
tell
anybody
because
of
what
emilie
said
but
since
it
has
been
so
bad
i
thought
i
would
tell
uncle
ralph
he
is
big
and
strong
you
know
and
he
laugh
at
at
you
dear
said
marion
eagerly
indeed
he
would
not
nor
would
i
sybil
you
know
i
you
tell
me
this
secret
darling
unless
of
course
you
are
sure
it
would
be
wrong
to
do
so
be
wrong
said
sybil
i
promised
and
oh
she
exclaimed
suddenly
while
a
sort
of
shiver
ran
through
it
is
so
dreadful
you
make
me
forget
it
dear
miss
freer
last
night
i
said
my
prayers
a
hundred
times
over
without
stopping
before
emilie
came
to
bed
but
it
was
no
use
i
go
to
sleep
and
it
gets
so
hot
under
the
clothes
i
can
hardly
how
do
you
menu
before
emilie
came
to
bed
asked
marion
she
sit
in
your
room
after
you
are
in
bed
i
am
sure
i
have
heard
that
she
was
told
to
do
answered
sybil
in
a
whisper
grandmamma
did
tell
her
so
after
lotty
went
to
sleep
in
room
i
was
always
able
to
go
to
sleep
before
that
but
emilie
stay
in
my
room
till
i
go
to
sleep
that
is
what
has
made
it
so
bad
only
she
told
me
not
to
tell
if
i
did
she
said
i
should
get
into
a
fit
and
die
all
alone
miss
freer
all
alone
except
for
them
the
child
added
in
a
whisper
of
the
utmost
horror
her
eyes
dilated
as
she
looked
up
into
anxious
face
suddenly
she
threw
herself
back
into
her
arms
clutching
her
tightly
in
her
terror
and
distress
and
burying
her
face
on
her
shoulder
she
exclaimed
make
me
tell
any
more
please
well
darling
replied
marion
soothingly
will
talk
about
some
nice
things
only
tell
me
dear
sybil
does
any
one
know
any
one
besides
emilie
knows
part
said
the
child
told
her
i
was
very
naughty
and
florence
kind
at
all
she
scolded
me
very
much
and
said
if
i
told
that
emilie
stay
with
me
she
would
get
me
sent
away
to
school
she
said
it
was
very
unkind
of
me
to
want
emilie
to
sit
all
the
evening
in
my
room
but
i
think
emilie
tell
it
her
all
or
she
would
not
have
scolded
me
so
emilie
does
tell
little
stories
miss
freer
and
i
like
her
but
florence
likes
her
because
she
does
a
great
deal
of
work
for
her
and
then
she
says
i
give
her
so
much
trouble
she
has
no
time
to
do
the
things
that
grandmamma
wants
done
and
it
true
miss
freer
said
sybil
emphatically
clenching
her
little
hands
in
indignation
dear
it
should
make
you
not
mind
so
much
what
emilie
says
if
she
is
so
careless
in
her
way
of
speaking
if
your
secret
is
about
something
emilie
has
told
i
would
try
not
to
think
any
more
about
but
that
is
true
repeated
sybil
relapsing
into
her
whisper
know
that
is
true
because
of
what
i
saw
miss
she
shuddered
as
she
spoke
and
marion
fearful
of
uselessly
exciting
it
was
evident
she
must
not
at
present
insist
upon
the
full
to
change
the
subject
after
some
efforts
she
succeeded
in
interesting
and
amusing
her
little
charge
who
by
the
end
of
the
morning
looked
brighter
and
happier
still
the
young
governess
felt
very
anxious
and
uneasy
when
the
hour
came
to
leave
her
pupils
for
the
day
sybil
looked
ready
to
burst
into
tears
again
but
marion
whispered
to
her
that
she
would
arrange
to
stay
an
hour
later
to
finish
a
delightful
story
that
had
been
broken
in
the
middle
which
promise
brought
back
a
smile
to
the
little
face
can
i
do
thought
marion
bear
to
leave
things
as
they
are
and
yet
any
interference
on
my
part
would
probably
do
no
good
and
only
cause
me
to
be
set
down
as
presumptuous
and
officious
it
might
even
lead
to
my
being
dismissed
and
then
how
miserable
and
forlorn
sybil
would
be
it
is
evident
that
wicked
emilie
is
terrifying
the
poor
child
to
prevent
her
complaining
of
her
and
miss
vyse
supporting
such
conduct
though
i
agree
with
sybil
that
emilie
must
have
told
the
story
in
her
own
way
miss
vyse
would
not
be
so
utterly
heartless
if
she
knew
what
the
child
is
actually
suffering
though
it
is
shameful
of
her
to
have
accepted
statement
as
to
naughtiness
in
that
careless
so
marion
thought
to
herself
but
she
could
see
nothing
likely
to
do
such
good
in
her
power
all
her
cogitations
ended
in
wishing
sir
ralph
were
back
again
but
she
resolved
in
the
meantime
to
watch
sybil
closely
and
if
no
improvement
became
manifest
to
brave
all
rather
than
conceal
the
hidden
mischief
she
now
had
proof
was
at
work
emilie
the
maid
she
had
seen
little
of
but
the
manner
and
appearance
she
disliked
lady
severn
unfortunately
had
an
exceedingly
high
opinion
of
her
and
miss
vyse
as
sybil
had
said
was
sure
to
take
her
part
for
the
reasons
the
child
had
been
quick
enough
to
discover
the
next
day
sybil
seemed
better
again
and
told
marion
she
had
had
very
nice
sleep
all
but
the
day
after
the
child
was
evidently
very
ill
there
were
black
circles
round
her
eyes
telling
of
sleepless
hours
and
nervous
suffering
the
pain
in
her
head
was
so
bad
she
said
she
could
not
see
the
words
in
her
when
she
tried
to
read
and
at
last
marion
gave
up
the
attempt
as
useless
sybil
would
not
speak
much
and
was
evidently
in
terror
of
renewing
the
subject
of
her
secret
alarms
so
after
trying
to
soothe
her
by
reading
aloud
some
of
the
little
favourite
fairy
tales
in
which
however
she
seemed
hardly
able
to
take
any
interest
the
young
governess
was
obliged
to
leave
her
for
the
day
lotty
did
not
seem
much
impressed
by
her
suffering
saying
carelessly
always
sulky
when
she
has
the
least
bit
of
a
when
lesson
hours
were
over
marion
asked
to
see
lady
severn
intending
to
tell
her
of
evident
illness
considerably
to
her
annoyance
lady
severn
sent
to
ask
her
to
see
her
in
the
in
consequence
of
which
miss
vyse
was
of
course
present
at
the
interview
which
effectually
dispelled
faint
hopes
of
being
able
to
do
poor
sybil
any
real
good
by
what
she
might
say
to
her
wished
to
see
me
miss
freer
i
believe
began
the
dowager
in
a
rather
icy
tone
to
tell
you
that
i
think
sybil
is
far
from
well
this
morning
replied
marion
rather
shortly
at
which
miss
vyse
smiled
contemptuously
as
she
bent
over
her
miss
entrance
into
the
room
she
had
acknowledged
by
the
slightest
and
most
indifferent
of
bows
or
rather
nods
that
i
am
quite
aware
said
lady
severn
make
a
point
of
seeing
the
children
every
morning
miss
freer
and
i
am
thoroughly
acquainted
with
constitution
she
is
only
suffering
from
one
of
her
old
attacks
and
the
usual
remedies
have
already
been
applied
your
intention
was
good
miss
freer
i
have
no
doubt
but
i
assure
you
it
is
quite
unnecessary
for
you
to
add
to
your
duties
the
care
of
my
health
it
is
in
older
and
naturally
more
experienced
hands
than
yours
at
the
same
time
i
thank
you
for
your
attention
to
again
miss
vyse
smiled
quietly
to
herself
marion
was
paler
than
usual
as
she
made
another
effort
for
her
poor
little
pupil
must
excuse
me
lady
severn
she
said
i
seem
officious
or
presuming
but
i
am
very
anxious
about
sybil
i
think
she
has
been
falling
off
for
some
time
i
am
afraid
she
does
not
sleep
well
and
bad
nights
are
sure
to
hurt
a
child
in
the
morning
she
often
looks
as
if
she
had
been
awake
all
has
never
been
a
good
sleeper
replied
lady
severn
but
not
unkindly
arises
merely
from
her
general
delicacy
it
is
not
to
be
expected
she
will
get
over
it
till
she
is
older
but
in
this
respect
she
is
already
improved
emilie
says
she
sleeps
soundly
now
does
she
not
florence
my
dear
she
inquired
of
miss
vyse
so
dear
aunt
replied
the
young
lady
with
the
same
sneer
in
her
voice
that
marion
had
detected
in
her
smile
course
miss
freer
can
not
understand
her
in
the
same
way
that
we
do
i
myself
think
her
wonderfully
improved
of
late
in
her
health
though
i
sometimes
fear
the
improvement
in
her
temper
and
disposition
is
not
so
quite
agree
with
you
my
love
said
lady
severn
not
think
i
am
finding
fault
miss
freer
but
you
must
allow
me
to
say
that
i
think
your
anxiety
would
be
better
directed
were
you
to
turn
it
to
the
points
my
niece
has
alluded
temper
and
whole
behaviour
are
all
i
could
wish
when
she
is
well
lady
severn
said
marion
stoutly
present
i
am
convinced
there
is
much
amiss
with
her
and
believe
it
arises
in
great
measure
from
her
having
bad
nights
i
believe
she
sometimes
can
not
go
to
sleep
for
hours
after
she
is
in
bed
i
am
sure
i
would
gladly
come
every
evening
to
sit
by
her
or
read
to
her
till
she
goes
to
sleep
if
that
would
do
any
miss
delicate
black
eyebrows
rose
in
supercilious
amazement
at
this
proposal
and
lady
severn
at
first
seemed
too
astonished
to
reply
at
last
she
said
miss
freer
i
suppose
i
must
again
give
you
credit
for
kindly
and
intention
but
your
must
allow
me
to
remind
you
that
i
have
an
ample
staff
of
servants
in
my
household
for
waiting
on
the
young
ladies
you
really
need
not
fear
they
are
in
any
way
indeed
repeated
miss
vyse
with
a
silvery
laugh
at
the
absurdity
of
the
idea
emilie
sits
the
whole
evening
besides
sybil
till
her
little
ladyship
goes
to
sleep
and
not
a
little
difficult
to
please
poor
emilie
has
found
her
of
late
i
can
assure
you
dear
aunt
sybil
is
a
child
that
requires
very
judicious
management
young
as
she
certainly
does
said
marion
quietly
looking
at
florence
as
she
spoke
and
then
as
it
appeared
that
miss
vyse
had
exhausted
her
stock
of
impertinent
sneers
and
innuendos
for
the
present
she
thought
it
as
well
to
take
leave
her
cheeks
burned
as
she
thought
quietly
over
the
interview
sybil
i
have
done
you
more
harm
than
good
i
fear
she
said
to
herself
and
then
in
her
genuine
anxiety
for
the
suffering
and
mismanaged
child
she
unselfishly
forgot
her
own
personal
annoyance
and
mortification
that
afternoon
as
she
was
sitting
with
cissy
charlie
attended
by
thérèse
returned
from
his
stroll
in
the
park
he
told
her
he
had
met
two
little
young
ladies
you
go
to
play
with
every
morning
may
and
the
littlest
one
had
red
eyes
as
if
she
had
been
crying
he
added
sympathisingly
baby
said
cissy
looks
horribly
ill
now
and
then
marion
i
fancy
they
are
rather
rough
with
her
sometimes
she
has
cowed
cowering
look
i
bear
to
see
in
a
all
of
which
added
not
a
little
uneasiness
an
hour
or
so
later
when
she
was
alone
in
her
room
thérèse
entered
you
please
mademoiselle
she
said
little
young
lady
asked
me
to
give
you
this
but
that
no
one
should
see
was
a
leaf
of
paper
on
which
was
written
in
large
round
text
hand
the
letters
shaky
and
crooked
and
the
whole
bearing
marks
of
being
a
laborious
and
painfully
accomplished
production
the
following
words
miss
freer
meet
the
little
boy
and
his
kind
nurse
often
and
lotty
would
tell
if
i
had
told
you
this
morneng
pleese
writ
to
unkel
at
paris
and
say
i
will
dye
if
he
wont
come
i
coudent
tell
eny
boddy
but
him
resolution
was
instantly
shaken
she
fortunately
remembered
the
name
of
the
hotel
at
which
sir
ralph
was
staying
and
that
post
bore
to
him
a
letter
from
her
enclosing
poor
piteous
appeal
she
told
sir
ralph
that
she
was
unable
to
explain
the
cause
of
the
suffering
but
that
she
suspected
that
some
cruel
trick
had
been
played
by
emilie
the
maid
for
the
sake
of
terrifying
her
into
silence
she
apologised
for
her
boldness
in
writing
to
trouble
him
about
it
but
added
that
she
saw
nothing
else
to
do
as
her
own
efforts
had
failed
to
awaken
lady
anxiety
about
the
poor
little
girl
and
she
ended
by
begging
him
to
return
to
altes
as
soon
as
possible
to
judge
for
himself
without
of
course
betraying
her
confidence
or
that
of
the
poor
child
once
her
letter
was
fairly
gone
marion
began
to
be
rather
frightened
at
what
she
had
done
she
was
perfectly
satisfied
that
the
step
she
had
taken
was
a
right
and
indeed
unavoidable
one
but
then
there
came
the
after
thought
will
he
think
of
me
for
having
done
it
knowing
what
i
do
of
his
opinion
of
me
how
could
i
have
been
the
one
for
any
reason
whatever
to
summon
him
back
here
before
i
leave
and
she
felt
half
inclined
to
run
away
from
altes
before
he
could
possibly
arrive
and
yet
with
it
all
there
was
a
strange
under
current
of
inexpressible
happiness
in
the
thought
that
now
she
was
almost
sure
to
see
him
again
to
hear
him
speak
to
feel
him
looking
kindly
at
her
once
more
more
if
only
that
and
nothing
beyond
yet
that
once
more
was
worth
living
for
days
passed
then
came
the
fourth
the
day
before
the
one
on
which
marion
had
calculated
it
might
be
possible
to
receive
an
answer
from
paris
she
had
not
been
alone
with
sybil
for
more
than
a
moment
since
receiving
her
note
lotty
seemed
inquisitive
and
suspicious
and
sybil
was
evidently
afraid
of
her
marion
could
only
manage
to
whisper
to
the
child
that
she
had
done
what
she
asked
without
any
further
explanation
passing
between
them
sybil
brightened
up
wonderfully
on
hearing
this
and
for
some
few
days
looked
so
much
better
that
marion
began
to
think
sir
ralph
would
consider
her
alarm
about
his
little
niece
very
exaggerated
if
not
altogether
uncalled
for
the
reflection
was
not
a
pleasant
one
there
was
no
letter
on
the
fifth
morning
nor
up
to
the
eighth
which
did
not
make
her
feel
any
the
more
comfortable
and
on
her
way
to
the
rue
des
lauriers
one
week
after
her
letter
had
gone
she
really
began
most
heartily
to
wish
she
had
not
written
at
all
but
the
first
sight
of
sybil
changed
her
feelings
entirely
the
child
looked
exceedingly
ill
and
was
as
before
utterly
unable
to
attend
to
her
lessons
she
lay
on
the
sofa
without
speaking
and
hardly
took
any
notice
even
of
her
kind
friend
only
as
marion
was
leaving
and
bent
down
to
kiss
her
sybil
whispered
hurriedly
he
coming
dear
i
hope
so
replied
marion
in
the
same
voice
there
was
no
time
for
more
for
just
then
emilie
entered
the
room
with
some
medicine
which
poor
sybil
was
obliged
to
take
every
two
hours
and
the
child
shrank
back
in
fear
this
was
the
evening
of
the
last
altes
ball
before
lent
cissy
was
not
inclined
to
go
not
feeling
particularly
well
and
marion
too
was
much
better
pleased
to
stay
at
home
they
spent
till
evening
as
usual
quietly
reading
and
working
from
time
to
time
the
roll
of
carriages
in
the
street
below
reminded
them
of
the
gaiety
which
the
little
world
of
altes
was
about
to
enjoy
marion
did
not
envy
the
but
she
could
not
help
thinking
half
sadly
of
her
one
ball
at
altes
and
all
that
passed
there
archer
was
tired
and
went
to
bed
early
leaving
her
cousin
alone
to
get
rid
of
her
thoughts
marion
got
a
book
and
forced
herself
to
attend
to
its
contents
in
which
she
so
succeeded
that
an
hour
or
two
went
by
and
it
was
close
to
midnight
before
she
moved
suddenly
she
was
startled
by
the
sound
of
a
carriage
driving
up
rapidly
and
stopping
at
their
door
knowing
that
all
the
servants
were
disposed
of
for
the
night
and
fearing
that
a
sudden
ring
of
the
bell
might
frighten
cissy
marion
went
quickly
to
the
front
door
which
she
unlocked
and
opened
softly
and
stood
with
it
slightly
ajar
watching
to
see
if
indeed
the
carriage
contained
any
visitor
for
them
she
heard
the
voice
replying
to
some
question
but
it
was
a
very
dark
night
and
she
could
distinguish
nothing
distinctly
in
a
moment
more
she
felt
rather
than
saw
that
some
one
was
approaching
the
door
which
to
prevent
this
ringing
the
bell
she
immediately
opened
more
widely
evidently
the
stranger
took
her
for
one
of
the
servants
for
though
apparently
rather
surprised
at
finding
the
door
open
and
some
one
behind
it
the
unseasonable
visitor
inquired
in
french
if
it
would
be
possible
for
him
to
see
de
ces
dames
madame
au
the
voice
told
more
tales
this
time
than
that
its
owner
was
an
englishman
ralph
said
the
girl
whom
in
the
dim
light
he
had
taken
for
a
servant
ralph
it
is
even
then
she
could
not
say
miss
freer
in
and
tell
me
what
is
the
matter
oh
tell
me
tell
me
quickly
she
added
as
she
saw
that
he
bore
a
burden
in
his
arms
something
covered
with
a
shawl
but
which
he
held
tenderly
and
closely
as
if
he
would
guard
it
from
touch
or
approach
is
that
sir
ralph
she
almost
screamed
as
he
entered
the
passage
and
she
saw
that
what
he
carried
was
like
a
lifeless
nerveless
body
hanging
limp
and
loose
and
heavy
in
his
grasp
though
she
could
see
no
face
or
features
marion
he
said
unconsciously
calling
her
what
she
had
called
herself
i
know
you
will
control
yourself
and
help
me
what
a
mercy
you
were
still
up
he
spoke
in
a
tone
that
marvellously
quieted
first
thrill
of
horror
but
she
could
hardly
control
herself
as
he
had
told
her
when
he
gently
laid
his
burden
on
the
sofa
in
the
still
lighted
and
softly
removing
the
shawl
from
the
face
showed
marion
that
it
was
sybil
poor
little
sybil
there
she
lay
her
eyes
closed
but
her
brow
contracted
as
if
with
pain
or
terror
ghastly
pale
with
the
paleness
it
seemed
to
marion
that
could
only
come
from
one
she
dead
she
whispered
ralph
turned
suddenly
to
her
darling
he
said
could
i
be
so
cruelly
thoughtless
as
to
forget
you
in
my
anxiety
about
this
poor
child
dead
no
indeed
no
she
is
only
fainting
and
will
revive
again
in
a
few
moments
but
dead
indeed
she
might
have
been
but
for
you
your
goodness
your
promptness
have
saved
her
it
anything
had
been
wanting
what
am
i
saying
he
exclaimed
with
a
sudden
change
of
tone
freer
you
must
think
me
but
she
said
nothing
she
leant
over
sybil
and
would
not
look
up
for
fear
of
meeting
his
eyes
as
she
asked
quietly
can
we
do
to
revive
her
he
said
is
already
coming
round
only
be
sure
to
let
her
see
you
and
this
room
as
soon
as
she
opens
her
eyes
she
has
already
fainted
once
or
twice
and
was
sent
into
hysterics
again
as
soon
as
she
came
round
by
the
sight
of
that
room
and
then
she
begged
me
to
bring
her
to
you
so
i
did
so
on
my
own
responsibility
my
mother
and
miss
vyse
are
out
at
a
ball
the
servants
there
told
me
i
sent
for
bailey
but
the
old
fool
was
not
to
be
found
gone
to
the
ball
too
i
dare
say
but
just
as
well
to
avoid
the
scandal
for
a
scandal
it
is
no
doubt
as
you
will
say
when
you
hear
it
all
i
got
her
this
the
on
our
way
here
it
do
her
any
and
as
he
spoke
he
produced
a
little
bottle
from
which
he
poured
a
few
drops
into
a
glass
of
water
which
marion
fetched
him
sybil
my
pet
he
said
as
the
little
girl
opened
her
eyes
and
glanced
round
her
with
an
expression
of
terror
dear
you
are
all
right
again
you
see
you
are
with
miss
freer
in
her
pretty
house
and
she
is
going
to
let
you
sleep
in
her
own
room
and
stay
with
you
all
at
which
information
the
poor
baby
tried
to
smile
as
she
stroked
hand
laid
on
her
caressingly
my
audacity
he
whispered
to
marion
you
will
be
as
good
as
my
word
this
once
you
know
i
will
answered
marion
in
the
same
tone
and
then
she
went
to
rouse
the
thérèse
and
as
far
as
possible
her
as
to
the
strange
state
of
things
between
them
poor
sybil
was
divested
of
her
cloaks
and
shawls
and
comfortably
ensconced
for
the
night
in
a
corner
of
bed
exhausted
by
all
she
had
gone
through
the
poor
child
soon
fell
asleep
marion
returned
for
a
moment
to
set
sir
mind
at
ease
about
his
little
niece
and
to
bid
him
he
only
detained
her
to
request
her
not
to
come
to
the
rue
des
lauriers
in
the
morning
as
he
would
explain
her
absence
to
lady
severn
he
also
promised
to
call
early
to
see
how
sybil
had
passed
the
night
and
to
explain
to
miss
freer
what
had
come
to
his
knowledge
as
to
the
cause
of
the
terror
and
consequent
illness
emilie
shall
leave
my
service
at
once
he
said
i
am
to
have
any
authority
at
all
over
my
nieces
but
by
the
morning
i
shall
be
able
to
explain
the
whole
affair
better
i
am
not
quite
clear
how
much
was
doing
and
how
much
the
result
of
pour
own
nervousness
the
poor
child
tried
to
tell
me
all
about
it
but
could
hardly
manage
to
do
so
clearly
in
the
state
she
was
may
be
sure
i
shall
take
good
care
of
her
said
marion
as
he
was
leaving
know
that
well
he
replied
that
reminds
me
he
went
on
have
never
thanked
you
for
it
all
what
a
boor
i
am
in
the
first
place
your
goodness
in
writing
to
me
and
now
for
your
goodness
in
taking
my
poor
child
in
as
you
have
done
i
am
so
stupid
miss
freer
at
thanking
people
but
you
know
what
i
mean
i
am
sure
you
do
something
more
i
would
ask
of
you
miss
freer
can
you
forgive
me
for
having
forgotten
myself
as
i
did
last
night
the
last
words
he
spoke
very
low
as
if
he
could
hardly
force
himself
to
utter
them
marion
did
not
speak
for
a
moment
and
he
went
on
must
think
me
with
presumption
and
folly
as
indeed
i
think
myself
i
thought
i
had
mastered
myself
miss
freer
knowing
all
i
do
both
to
myself
and
you
you
i
trust
will
be
very
happy
in
the
life
you
have
happier
than
i
must
take
care
or
i
shall
have
to
ask
you
to
forgive
me
again
can
you
do
so
miss
he
added
softly
as
if
in
spite
of
himself
and
marion
looked
up
in
his
face
and
said
the
one
little
word
he
wrung
her
hand
and
left
her
and
she
laid
herself
down
beside
the
innocent
little
child
he
had
given
into
her
care
and
tried
to
sleep
but
in
vain
all
night
long
she
tossed
about
imagining
herself
kept
awake
by
her
anxiety
about
sybil
but
in
reality
going
over
and
over
to
herself
his
words
his
looks
his
tones
and
wondering
why
he
behaved
so
strangely
and
how
it
would
all
end

ralph
called
early
the
next
morning
as
he
had
promised
he
was
relieved
to
find
by
account
that
sybil
was
fairly
well
and
that
there
appeared
no
necessity
for
sending
for
bailey
at
earnest
request
her
uncle
went
in
to
see
her
and
remained
with
her
some
time
when
he
returned
to
the
he
gave
marion
and
archer
who
had
just
made
her
appearance
two
hours
earlier
than
usual
thanks
to
her
curiosity
a
full
account
of
the
whole
mysterious
affair
which
with
the
additional
light
thrown
upon
it
by
communications
this
morning
he
said
he
had
now
got
to
the
bottom
of
this
was
what
he
had
to
tell
immediately
on
the
receipt
of
letter
this
part
of
the
story
was
not
revealed
to
archer
he
prepared
to
leave
paris
some
delays
arose
however
in
consequence
of
which
it
was
not
till
the
evening
the
eighth
day
after
receiving
her
summons
that
he
found
himself
again
at
altes
he
drove
straight
to
the
rue
des
lauriers
where
he
had
to
wait
some
time
at
the
door
without
any
one
coming
to
open
it
growing
impatient
and
rather
uneasy
for
his
mind
was
full
of
what
marion
had
written
to
him
about
sybil
he
suddenly
bethought
himself
that
as
likely
as
not
the
in
the
which
opened
on
to
the
garden
might
be
unlatched
he
left
the
and
returned
to
the
street
told
the
driver
of
the
carriage
which
had
brought
himself
and
his
luggage
from
the
coach
office
to
wait
a
few
minutes
and
then
made
his
way
to
the
garden
at
the
top
of
the
hilly
street
on
which
opened
the
the
garden
gate
was
fastened
but
he
easily
climbed
over
the
railings
and
hastened
to
the
glass
door
the
blinds
were
down
but
the
light
inside
was
low
evidently
no
one
in
the
room
to
be
started
by
his
unceremonious
entrance
more
and
more
alarmed
he
quickly
tried
the
door
found
it
as
he
expected
unlatched
and
in
another
moment
was
in
the
room
the
lamp
was
burning
feebly
the
fire
all
but
out
what
could
be
the
meaning
of
it
all
thinking
of
nothing
but
sybil
it
rushed
into
his
mind
that
perhaps
the
child
was
very
ill
dying
it
might
be
and
he
too
late
to
save
her
half
expecting
to
find
the
whole
assembled
in
mournful
vigil
round
her
bed
he
made
his
way
softly
to
her
room
as
he
passed
the
chamber
occupied
by
miss
vyse
he
noticed
that
the
door
was
open
and
a
light
on
the
table
he
peeped
in
but
there
was
no
one
there
but
on
the
pillow
lay
as
mass
of
golden
curls
all
but
hiding
a
round
rosy
childish
thee
which
he
soon
identified
as
dotty
fast
asleep
the
picture
of
health
and
comfort
somewhat
relieved
in
his
mind
but
nevertheless
surprised
at
the
change
in
the
domestic
arrangements
which
had
thus
separated
the
two
little
sisters
he
stepped
softly
to
the
other
end
of
the
long
passage
up
from
which
again
a
short
staircase
led
to
the
little
vestibule
on
to
which
opened
the
nursery
apartments
all
was
quiet
there
was
very
little
light
only
what
found
its
way
up
from
the
lamp
in
the
long
passage
below
the
door
of
the
bedroom
was
nearly
closed
he
entered
the
room
the
first
thing
that
struck
him
was
that
the
doors
of
a
large
close
to
the
entrance
of
the
room
stood
wide
open
disclosing
a
row
of
dresses
evidently
the
property
of
mdlle
emilie
which
in
the
faint
light
bore
a
startling
resemblance
to
the
headless
occupants
of
the
bluebeard
chamber
half
smiling
at
his
own
fancy
sir
ralph
approached
the
little
bed
which
he
knew
to
be
but
the
smile
quickly
faded
from
his
face
at
what
met
him
there
at
first
sight
he
thought
there
was
no
one
in
the
bed
but
looking
more
closely
he
distinguished
the
outlines
of
a
little
form
lying
perfectly
motionless
under
the
coverings
huddled
up
together
in
a
sort
of
heap
it
seemed
to
be
ah
how
thankful
he
felt
that
it
lay
thus
instead
of
straightened
out
into
that
awful
length
and
stiffness
under
the
white
sheet
which
once
seen
is
never
never
again
forgotten
still
though
not
so
bad
as
that
there
was
cause
enough
for
alarm
he
said
gently
dear
are
you
asleep
put
down
the
clothes
and
look
at
me
i
have
got
your
letter
and
have
come
from
paris
as
fast
as
i
but
there
was
no
answer
no
movement
his
eyes
were
growing
accustomed
to
the
dim
light
and
he
could
have
distinguished
the
least
quiver
in
the
little
figure
he
looked
round
an
unlighted
candle
and
matches
stood
on
the
table
he
struck
a
light
and
again
spoke
to
the
child
but
it
was
no
use
so
he
tenderly
removed
the
clothes
and
raised
the
face
which
was
turned
round
on
to
the
pillow
it
was
indeed
sybil
but
what
a
sybil
to
greet
him
on
his
return
she
was
perfectly
unconscious
in
a
dead
swoon
or
faint
which
for
all
he
knew
might
already
have
lasted
so
long
that
recovery
might
be
impossible
but
he
had
known
her
faint
before
poor
little
girl
and
was
at
no
loss
what
remedies
to
employ
he
took
her
in
his
arms
chafed
her
cold
hands
and
feet
bathed
her
forehead
and
tried
hard
to
revive
her
with
strong
smelling
salts
which
he
found
after
a
search
in
miss
sanctum
he
would
not
as
yet
ring
for
assistance
he
was
so
sure
the
child
would
best
recover
were
she
on
regaining
her
senses
to
find
herself
alone
with
him
in
a
few
minutes
she
began
to
show
signs
of
returning
consciousness
at
last
she
opened
her
eyes
raised
herself
in
his
arms
and
looked
about
her
with
that
dazed
look
peculiar
to
people
when
recovering
from
a
state
of
insensibility
he
was
on
the
alert
for
this
moment
you
awake
now
sybil
dear
he
said
you
pleased
to
see
me
come
back
she
turned
to
see
his
face
oh
what
a
look
of
relief
and
happiness
overspread
her
poor
pale
drawn
features
ralph
she
whispered
uncle
ralph
will
you
send
them
away
she
went
on
with
with
a
thrill
of
agony
in
her
voice
will
you
send
them
away
dear
what
he
asked
eagerly
dreadful
people
those
ladies
without
any
heads
they
were
cut
off
long
ago
down
there
in
the
courtyard
with
that
dreadful
big
cutting
thing
and
they
walk
about
the
house
at
night
and
they
come
to
the
side
of
any
little
bed
if
she
go
to
sleep
quick
and
they
came
again
and
oh
uncle
coming
now
she
screamed
as
happening
to
turn
round
she
caught
sight
of
the
row
of
headless
dresses
in
the
cupboard
and
before
ralph
could
soothe
or
explain
away
her
terror
the
little
creature
was
torn
with
terrible
hysterics
screaming
and
shaking
in
a
way
pitiful
to
see
till
she
again
subsided
into
the
faint
from
which
he
had
but
just
restored
her
now
he
was
obliged
to
summon
assistance
in
five
minutes
the
house
was
in
a
ferment
such
servants
as
had
not
taken
advantage
of
their
rare
absence
to
amuse
themselves
elsewhere
among
which
was
not
mdlle
emilie
were
immediately
rushing
about
some
suggesting
one
thing
some
another
till
sir
ralph
wished
he
had
managed
the
child
by
himself
at
last
among
them
they
succeeded
in
reviving
her
this
time
her
uncle
took
care
to
have
the
cupboard
doors
shut
before
she
opened
her
eyes
and
he
was
only
too
thankful
to
agree
notwithstanding
the
amazement
of
the
scandalized
servants
to
her
proposal
that
he
should
take
her
away
to
miss
house
where
dreadful
people
could
not
this
was
the
history
of
the
previous
adventures
up
to
the
time
when
sir
ralph
arrived
at
door
with
sybil
in
his
arms
cissy
and
marion
listened
in
silence
to
his
recital
but
when
having
got
so
far
he
stopped
for
a
moment
to
take
breath
the
former
had
a
host
of
questions
ready
for
him
what
in
the
world
did
the
child
mean
sir
ralph
she
inquired
eagerly
people
without
of
in
the
i
make
it
out
in
the
least
and
if
as
may
here
suspects
emilie
the
maid
is
at
the
bottom
of
it
what
could
be
her
motive
what
good
could
it
do
her
to
frighten
the
child
to
death
as
she
nearly
did
no
i
make
it
could
i
archer
replied
sir
ralph
i
heard
what
sybil
had
to
say
this
morning
during
the
revolution
it
is
perfectly
true
beads
were
cut
off
in
our
for
there
stood
the
guillotine
this
is
a
fact
sure
enough
and
well
known
at
altes
and
i
now
perfectly
remember
being
mentioned
to
us
when
we
first
came
here
sybil
it
appears
heard
it
too
and
from
the
first
it
made
a
strong
impression
on
her
sensitive
imagination
she
tells
me
she
never
could
bear
to
look
out
on
the
courtyard
after
it
grew
dark
at
night
for
then
this
wicked
emilie
told
her
the
decapitated
victims
might
be
seen
promenading
about
some
emilie
told
her
with
a
view
to
heightening
the
dramatic
effect
of
her
story
might
be
perceived
grubbing
about
among
the
stones
with
which
the
yard
is
paved
for
the
lost
heads
supposed
there
to
be
buried
others
again
would
be
seen
marching
along
triumphantly
like
denis
with
their
heads
reposing
under
their
arms
it
is
really
too
absurd
he
said
laughing
hideous
enough
to
the
imagination
of
a
nervous
little
creature
of
eight
years
what
in
the
world
did
emilie
tell
her
all
this
for
asked
marion
speaking
for
the
first
time
may
well
ask
he
replied
as
far
as
i
can
make
out
she
did
it
in
the
first
place
simply
out
of
a
spirit
of
low
mischief
for
the
pure
pleasure
of
teasing
the
child
whom
she
evidently
does
not
like
and
amusing
herself
with
her
terrors
before
long
she
must
have
discovered
that
she
could
turn
fears
to
useful
account
for
some
time
past
it
appears
miss
vyse
has
taken
it
into
her
head
to
have
lotty
domiciled
in
her
own
room
before
this
sybil
was
comparatively
happy
substantial
presence
appearing
to
her
a
sufficient
safeguard
against
ghostly
visitants
but
when
she
was
left
alone
in
the
room
at
night
her
terrors
increased
so
that
she
could
not
go
to
sleep
she
begged
my
mother
to
let
her
have
a
light
in
the
room
till
emilie
came
to
bed
but
this
request
was
refused
my
mother
having
a
notion
that
it
would
be
bad
for
the
eyes
to
make
up
for
this
however
emilie
was
ordered
to
sit
by
sybil
every
evening
till
the
child
fell
asleep
not
the
pleasantest
of
duties
apparently
for
emilie
regularly
shirked
it
two
or
three
times
on
being
thus
left
to
herself
sybil
jumped
out
of
bed
and
ran
down
stairs
to
fetch
emilie
conduct
which
that
young
person
much
resented
as
it
interfered
with
her
more
entertaining
way
of
spending
the
evening
and
also
very
nearly
more
than
once
brought
her
into
disgrace
with
the
authorities
below
stairs
so
she
hit
on
the
ingenious
expedient
of
telling
sybil
that
the
headless
spectres
were
said
to
have
a
special
predilection
for
the
long
passage
leading
to
her
room
come
along
there
every
night
sybil
informed
me
if
they
find
any
little
girl
awake
they
come
to
the
side
of
her
bed
and
stand
in
a
it
really
frightful
to
think
of
the
lonely
little
agonies
said
marion
what
about
the
dresses
hanging
up
that
was
another
clever
dodge
of
evidently
i
asked
sybil
how
ever
she
could
be
frightened
at
dresses
hanging
on
pegs
but
she
assured
me
she
did
not
know
there
were
any
dresses
there
so
i
suppose
emilie
keeps
the
cupboard
locked
in
the
and
opens
it
at
night
to
prevent
venturing
to
rush
past
the
dreadful
row
of
spectres
at
the
another
thing
sir
ralph
said
marion
was
sybil
afraid
to
tell
me
was
afraid
to
tell
any
one
i
think
answered
he
me
because
as
she
expressed
it
i
was
and
and
hurt
me
one
day
it
seems
when
much
provoked
by
her
complaints
emilie
gave
a
garbled
account
of
the
affair
to
miss
vyse
who
sybil
says
for
reasons
of
her
own
was
very
unkind
to
her
and
defended
emilie
sybil
would
told
you
miss
freer
but
one
day
when
she
was
on
the
point
of
doing
so
emilie
perceiving
i
suppose
that
the
powers
or
endurance
were
all
but
exhausted
terrified
her
into
not
confiding
in
you
by
vague
hints
of
injury
that
might
result
to
you
from
her
so
doing
sybil
is
rather
misty
as
to
what
exactly
emilie
said
but
it
seems
to
have
been
to
the
effect
that
if
sybil
set
you
against
her
by
complaints
of
her
nightly
neglect
of
her
duty
she
emilie
could
easily
be
revenged
on
you
by
certain
information
about
you
in
her
possession
which
sybil
says
grandmamma
knew
would
have
made
her
miss
freer
i
am
not
clear
about
it
myself
i
only
tell
it
you
to
warn
you
to
have
nothing
to
say
to
the
girl
out
of
pity
or
any
other
kindly
motive
she
shall
be
and
that
very
quickly
but
first
i
shall
make
her
explain
her
insolent
words
he
added
with
a
dark
frown
on
his
face
but
just
then
the
clock
struck
eleven
sir
ralph
jumped
up
must
be
going
he
said
want
particularly
to
be
home
before
my
mother
and
miss
vyse
are
visible
i
forbade
the
servants
to
say
anything
to
them
last
night
and
this
morning
i
counted
on
their
not
being
very
alert
after
last
was
just
wondering
what
lady
severn
would
think
of
it
all
remarked
archer
know
what
she
shall
think
of
it
all
replied
sir
ralph
is
to
say
at
least
if
i
have
any
spark
of
influence
left
he
added
in
a
lower
tone
the
meantime
archer
will
you
be
so
very
kind
as
to
keep
sybil
her
till
i
have
set
things
straight
again
at
home
the
greatest
pleasure
she
replied
heartily
and
then
he
left
them
just
as
he
was
outside
the
room
she
exclaimed
sir
ralph
you
must
get
some
one
to
pack
up
and
send
her
some
but
he
did
not
hear
her
and
marion
ran
after
him
to
repeat
the
message
well
you
thought
of
it
he
said
laughing
and
then
he
stood
for
a
moment
if
expecting
her
to
say
something
more
ralph
she
said
you
do
me
a
favour
would
i
not
he
exclaimed
you
be
so
good
as
not
mention
my
name
at
all
to
that
girl
emilie
she
asked
mind
if
says
rude
or
impertinent
things
about
me
let
them
pass
only
set
her
more
against
me
i
like
having
well
she
replied
you
wish
it
i
will
endeavour
to
do
as
you
but
he
looked
rather
surprised
daresay
you
think
me
very
silly
she
said
nothing
he
interrupted
your
mind
quite
easy
you
are
only
too
good
too
indeed
i
am
not
she
said
with
a
little
sigh
motive
is
a
selfish
one
i
can
not
afford
to
have
he
looked
at
her
searchingly
but
very
kindly
saying
however
nothing
the
thought
passed
through
his
mind
must
be
some
family
disgrace
something
connected
with
that
father
my
poor
darling
if
only
i
were
free
can
she
think
anything
of
that
sort
would
influence
me
but
i
am
forgetting
she
will
have
some
one
else
soon
to
fight
her
battles
just
as
well
perhaps
for
her
chances
of
happiness
that
she
will
be
out
in
india
as
well
for
in
every
way
me
as
marion
returned
to
the
she
said
to
cissy
you
think
it
possible
that
that
emilie
has
found
out
about
me
cissy
out
about
you
repeated
archer
what
do
you
mean
freer
is
not
my
real
name
and
all
about
it
answered
marion
child
how
could
she
know
anything
of
the
sort
be
so
silly
besides
if
she
did
you
speak
as
if
it
were
a
disgrace
i
declare
marion
you
provoke
me
i
wish
most
sincerely
that
every
one
in
altes
knew
your
real
name
be
the
consequences
what
they
cissy
said
marion
reproachfully
for
cissy
had
spoken
crossly
and
pettishly
but
cissy
was
not
repentant
not
good
your
saying
in
that
way
marion
i
repeat
what
i
said
before
i
wish
every
one
in
altes
knew
the
true
state
of
the
her
tone
was
a
trifle
sharp
and
unkind
but
her
heart
was
full
of
anxious
affection
of
late
certain
misgivings
had
begun
to
assail
her
and
she
had
spoken
the
truth
as
to
her
wish
that
the
whole
were
known
would
indeed
be
carrying
it
too
far
she
said
to
herself
her
for
the
sake
or
concealing
that
misdemeanours
no
indeed
rather
than
that
i
would
brave
anything
or
but
she
was
too
much
in
awe
of
marion
to
utter
any
of
these
thoughts
aloud
when
sir
ralph
returned
to
the
rue
des
lauriers
morning
a
council
of
held
in
his
at
which
for
once
in
his
life
ralph
severn
distinguished
himself
by
proving
beyond
dispute
that
he
had
a
will
and
a
very
strong
one
too
of
his
own
lady
severn
was
amazed
indignant
but
finally
submissive
repentant
even
for
having
as
her
son
phrased
it
such
without
finding
them
an
irish
way
of
putting
it
certainly
he
said
with
a
laugh
for
he
could
afford
to
now
that
he
was
victorious
he
was
a
man
who
could
fight
and
bravely
too
for
any
one
in
the
world
but
himself
miss
vyse
escaped
of
course
expressing
the
greatest
surprise
and
disappointment
at
girl
we
all
thought
so
well
of
she
said
with
an
air
of
most
virtuous
indignation
have
deceived
us
so
grossly
to
think
how
all
this
time
she
has
been
making
our
poor
darling
sybil
suffer
why
if
i
had
only
known
she
grudged
sitting
beside
the
dear
child
in
the
evenings
how
gladly
i
would
have
done
so
myself
florence
quite
thought
she
was
speaking
the
truth
sir
ralph
she
continued
fortunate
it
was
you
returned
last
night
in
that
unexpected
way
more
than
fortunate
indeed
providential
i
may
call
so
replied
ralph
dryly
that
you
and
my
mother
were
out
at
a
ball
by
the
way
how
did
you
enjoy
it
well
replied
florence
not
quite
sure
if
he
had
been
laughing
at
her
or
not
missed
your
waltzing
sir
ralph
indeed
i
think
i
have
enjoyed
any
of
the
balls
so
much
as
the
second
one
you
remember
before
you
went
away
so
suddenly
still
i
believe
last
was
considered
a
good
one
it
was
well
i
heard
said
ralph
carelessly
you
heard
said
lady
severn
travels
fast
it
appears
it
only
took
place
last
night
and
you
have
seen
no
one
this
morning
except
archer
and
she
at
he
replied
i
met
young
nodouroff
this
morning
on
my
way
to
inquire
about
sybil
by
the
by
i
wonder
why
archer
at
said
his
mother
only
went
for
the
sake
of
that
girl
miss
she
i
suppose
care
about
going
again
observed
florence
only
went
to
the
one
certainly
most
of
the
people
they
know
best
have
left
the
frasers
and
captain
berwick
he
has
been
away
for
two
or
three
weeks
but
his
sister
said
last
night
that
he
is
coming
back
in
a
week
or
indeed
said
lady
severn
whereupon
the
conversation
dropped
emilie
was
dismissed
on
the
spot
she
at
first
attempted
some
vindication
of
her
conduct
which
however
sir
ralph
very
quickly
put
a
stop
to
and
further
astonished
her
by
some
observations
on
her
own
behaviour
more
truthful
than
agreeable
would
have
thought
so
quiet
a
gentleman
could
fly
out
so
like
observed
taylor
the
leading
authority
below
stairs
of
course
as
soon
as
the
culprit
was
out
and
punished
the
whole
of
the
servants
were
down
upon
her
one
had
liked
her
ways
another
had
thought
as
in
short
not
one
of
them
by
their
own
account
but
had
possessed
evidence
enough
against
her
to
have
led
to
her
dismissal
months
before
and
thus
saved
an
innocent
child
many
weeks
of
agony
ending
in
imminent
risk
to
her
reason
if
not
to
her
life
young
berwick
has
been
away
ralph
for
this
reason
miss
freer
was
supposed
not
to
care
about
going
to
the
ball
all
well
so
be
it
sybil
remained
some
days
at
by
no
means
to
her
delight
indeed
but
for
unwonted
but
none
the
less
strenuous
opposition
the
child
would
have
been
sent
for
home
that
same
afternoon
he
took
the
whole
responsibility
blame
if
there
were
any
on
himself
religiously
refraining
from
mentioning
miss
freer
as
having
had
any
share
whatever
in
the
affair
though
dwelling
strongly
on
the
ready
kindness
and
hospitality
of
archer
in
the
emergency
yet
notwithstanding
all
his
care
the
fact
of
flight
annoyed
lady
severn
exceedingly
naturally
so
perhaps
from
that
time
also
her
growing
dislike
to
the
young
governess
increased
rapidly
which
miss
vyse
was
quick
to
perceive
and
to
rejoice
at
its
seed
was
of
her
own
sowing
and
had
been
fostered
with
the
greatest
care
it
was
to
be
expected
therefore
that
the
sight
of
its
strength
and
vigour
should
fill
her
with
gratification
the
week
that
sybil
spent
with
her
kind
friends
was
the
happiest
she
had
ever
known
lessons
at
the
rue
des
lauriers
were
suspended
for
the
time
lotty
was
allowed
by
her
intercession
to
spend
some
afternoons
with
her
little
sister
she
was
sorry
for
sybil
and
anxious
to
make
up
to
her
for
her
roughness
and
unkindness
the
two
little
sisters
appeared
to
cling
to
each
other
more
fondly
and
closely
than
had
been
the
case
for
long
a
state
of
things
the
good
influences
about
them
were
not
likely
to
discourage
with
much
care
marion
and
sir
ralph
endeavoured
to
efface
from
poor
mind
the
recollection
of
her
midnight
terrors
and
to
some
extent
succeeded
though
so
vainly
nervous
and
impressionable
the
child
was
also
sensible
and
by
no
means
deficient
in
reasoning
powers
by
the
end
of
the
week
she
perfectly
understood
and
believed
that
no
real
grounds
for
her
alarm
had
existed
though
at
the
same
time
she
begged
that
she
might
not
again
be
asked
to
sleep
in
the
room
where
he
had
passed
so
many
hours
or
misery
this
request
was
of
course
acceded
to
and
her
future
comfort
further
ensured
by
a
kindly
and
trustworthy
young
woman
an
elder
sister
of
the
amiable
thérèse
being
engaged
in
the
place
of
the
objectionable
emilie
during
this
week
sir
ralph
was
naturally
good
deal
at
house
which
as
might
have
been
expected
did
not
tend
to
increase
his
peace
of
mind
the
state
of
calm
equability
which
during
his
absence
from
altes
he
believed
himself
to
have
attained
lasted
only
till
he
was
again
in
presence
after
much
resistance
many
struggles
he
gave
in
resigning
himself
to
his
fate
and
to
the
intense
enjoyment
of
the
present
all
thought
he
suppose
not
much
worse
for
me
than
for
other
people
i
am
certainly
not
likely
to
go
in
for
this
sort
or
thing
twice
in
my
life
and
i
may
as
well
take
the
wretched
little
taste
of
happiness
that
has
come
in
my
way
for
the
very
short
time
it
can
happiness
it
was
though
certainly
of
curious
kind
he
perfectly
believed
her
to
be
engaged
to
marry
another
man
one
too
whom
he
could
quite
imagine
it
possible
that
she
cared
for
sincerely
though
not
perhaps
to
the
full
extent
that
a
nature
such
as
hers
was
capable
of
he
believed
too
that
under
any
circumstances
it
would
have
been
impossible
for
her
to
care
for
him
the
man
ralph
severn
to
even
this
same
small
extent
besides
which
his
circumstances
were
such
that
he
considered
marriage
at
least
for
many
years
to
come
as
all
but
out
of
the
question
for
him
he
knew
all
this
he
repeated
it
over
to
himself
a
dozen
times
a
could
not
stay
away
from
her
it
was
happiness
even
to
be
in
the
same
room
with
her
she
was
so
sweet
so
gentle
and
yet
so
bright
and
intelligent
a
merely
sweet
and
gentle
woman
would
not
have
contented

would
not
though
her
beauty
might
have
ten
times
exceeded
that
of
marion
vere
have
made
him
feel
as
she
did
that
here
indeed
was
one
who
suited
the
innermost
fibre
of
his
so
he
went
on
playing
alas
with
edged
tools
knowing
full
well
that
the
day
was
not
far
distant
when
they
would
cut
him
and
deeply
too
but
thinking
not
be
it
remembered
in
his
defence
that
there
was
the
slightest
danger
of
their
wounding
another
as
well
as
himself
another
not
perhaps
capable
of
deeper
suffering
than
he
but
a
gentle
tender
creature
one
to
whom
such
suffering
would
be
hard
and
strange
who
would
not
improbably
sink
altogether
beneath
it
and
one
too
whom
he
strong
brave
though
as
yet
he
hardly
knew
it
so
entirely
so
intensely
that
to
save
her
he
would
gladly
have
agreed
to
bear
through
life
the
burden
of
her
sorrow
in
addition
to
his
own
but
for
this
little
space
he
went
dreaming
on
there
was
not
just
yet
anything
exactly
to
awaken
him
besides
he
thought
himself
so
particularly
wide
awake
the
remembrance
of
frank
existence
was
never
absent
from
him
he
looked
upon
it
as
a
sort
of
charm
a
safeguard
against
any
possible
imprudence
every
now
and
then
he
used
to
give
himself
a
little
prick
with
it
as
a
sort
of
wholesome
reminder
as
it
were
he
noticed
certainly
that
the
young
man
was
seldom
if
ever
named
by
either
archer
or
marion
but
that
under
the
circumstances
was
not
to
be
wondered
at
the
engagement
was
not
as
yet
a
formally
announced
one
though
he
had
heard
it
alluded
to
two
or
three
times
in
other
quarters
absence
was
probably
connected
with
arrangements
he
might
be
making
in
preparation
for
his
marriage
in
short
there
were
a
hundred
reasons
why
they
should
not
care
to
talk
about
him
no
doubt
it
was
decidedly
pleasanter
for
ralph
that
they
should
not
do
so
he
fancied
himself
quite
prepared
for
it
at
any
time
but
in
point
of
fact
pricking
oneself
now
and
then
in
a
gingerly
manner
by
way
of
testing
powers
of
endurance
is
a
very
different
thing
from
the
relentless
cut
of
a
lancet
or
the
deep
piercing
stab
of
an
poniard
still
now
and
then
he
felt
puzzled
marion
herself
puzzled
him
in
some
way
she
was
changed
from
what
she
had
been
when
he
first
knew
her
she
had
never
seemed
robust
though
perfectly
healthy
but
now
she
looked
at
times
strangely
fragile
her
spirits
were
less
equable
her
colour
went
and
came
in
a
way
he
did
like
to
see
she
was
always
sweet
and
cheerful
never
more
so
than
now
but
it
sometimes
seemed
to
him
that
it
cost
her
an
effort
to
appear
so
then
again
she
would
be
so
unaffectedly
bright
and
merry
so
almost
childishly
gay
and
that
all
his
misgivings
so
far
as
she
was
concerned
vanished
as
if
by
magic
and
then
he
found
himself
back
again
in
his
old
place
and
dull
and
utterly
unsuited
to
this
happy
young
creature
whom
yet
in
all
her
moods
he
found
so
inexpressibly
winning
and
attractive
she
liked
was
sure
of
and
trusted
and
respected
him
he
said
to
himself
with
a
mental
wry
face
not
sure
but
what
i
would
rather
she
hated
me
he
thought
more
than
once
and
then
one
day
came
the
rude
awakening
all
the
ruder
because
he
did
not
know
he
had
been
dreaming
or
rather
how
unconsciously
he
had
come
to
live
in
his
dreams
to
care
more
for
them
than
for
aught
that
passed
in
world
of
realities
it
was
one
lovely
spring
afternoon
early
in
march
a
week
or
two
after
sybil
had
returned
home
and
everything
in
the
little
world
of
altes
appeared
for
the
time
being
to
be
jogging
on
in
its
usual
course
sir
ralph
had
sauntered
into
a
not
unprecedented
occurrence
for
her
little
was
a
pleasant
place
to
spend
an
hour
or
two
in
these
hot
afternoons
spring
to
our
northern
ears
hardly
expresses
the
warmth
and
brilliancy
of
some
of
these
exquisite
first
tastes
of
the
coming
summer
in
the
south
of
france
the
loveliest
time
indeed
of
all
the
year
thereabouts
while
the
green
below
still
fresh
and
radiant
matches
in
brilliance
the
blue
above
later
on
in
the
season
trees
and
herbage
look
and
scorched
and
one
turns
with
relief
to
the
thought
of
our
less
intense
summers
at
home
it
was
very
hot
already
at
altes
though
every
one
was
prophesying
a
week
or
two
of
rain
before
the
warm
weather
should
finally
set
in
this
afternoon
when
ralph
came
in
he
found
both
archer
and
her
friend
on
the
terrace
under
the
shade
of
the
large
attached
to
the
windows
outside
soon
however
cissy
got
tired
and
ensconced
herself
on
her
favourite
sofa
in
the
coolest
corner
of
the
marion
however
stayed
outside
she
was
busy
about
some
piece
of
work
she
seemed
to
be
greatly
interested
in
and
ralph
established
himself
on
the
ground
near
her
with
a
book
in
his
hand
which
he
professed
to
be
reading
now
and
then
favouring
his
companions
with
choice
bits
which
struck
his
fancy
but
in
reality
most
of
his
attention
wag
given
to
marion
he
watched
her
from
behind
his
book
and
thought
how
pretty
her
hands
looked
glancing
in
and
out
of
the
bright
mazes
of
the
wools
she
was
working
it
was
a
deliciously
lazy
afternoon
hot
enough
to
excuse
not
feeling
much
inclined
for
exertion
and
yet
with
all
the
freshness
and
novelty
of
spring
about
it
too
they
were
all
very
happy
marion
in
her
own
way
enjoying
the
present
and
ralph
all
his
pricks
forgotten
for
the
time
in
a
state
of
perfect
content
he
had
actually
got
the
length
of
talking
nonsense
he
the
learned
sir
ralph
severn
the
polyglot
the
antiquary
the
as
cissy
was
impertinent
enough
to
describe
him
that
ago
it
seemed
his
name
was
heard
by
marion
vere
for
the
first
suddenly
there
came
a
little
pause
which
was
broken
by
cissy
whose
ideas
seldom
ran
in
one
direction
for
five
minutes
together
she
exclaimed
from
her
sofa
it
that
frank
berwick
is
expected
back
i
hope
it
is
for
i
am
most
anxious
to
see
how
he
has
executed
our
commissions
you
mean
cissy
said
marion
something
in
the
tone
struck
ralph
as
unlike
the
usual
voice
something
slightly
sharp
hardly
knew
what
but
he
did
not
look
at
her
just
then
child
persisted
cissy
who
in
spite
of
all
her
quickness
was
sometimes
marvellously
dull
and
who
too
like
many
otherwise
most
amiable
people
would
sometimes
to
prove
her
in
the
right
talk
far
from
cautiously
or
advisedly
child
it
is
ridiculous
of
you
to
speak
that
way
whether
they
are
actually
your
commissions
or
mine
you
know
very
well
it
was
to
oblige
you
frank
berwick
offered
to
execute
them
indeed
she
went
on
recklessly
it
was
any
other
girl
than
you
i
should
call
it
very
affected
of
you
trying
to
make
out
said
marion
then
ralph
looked
at
her
from
where
she
sat
archer
could
not
see
her
cousin
but
the
tone
of
voice
stopped
her
in
what
more
she
was
going
to
say
and
she
muttered
some
half
apology
carelessly
and
took
up
a
book
that
lay
beside
her
so
the
sudden
silence
that
followed
was
never
explained
to
and
indeed
hardly
observed
by
archer
ralph
looked
up
at
marion
for
an
instant
her
eyes
met
but
immediately
she
turned
away
but
he
had
seen
enough
she
rarely
as
a
rule
changed
colour
the
more
therefore
appeared
to
him
the
flood
of
crimson
which
now
overspread
her
face
not
face
only
neck
throat
all
of
the
fair
white
skin
that
was
visible
changed
to
deep
burning
red
not
a
merely
passing
girlish
blush
but
a
hot
crimson
glow
that
to
ralph
told
of
deep
heart
emotion
he
was
right
but
was
it
all
for
frank
berwick
thought
poor
marion
a
fool
i
am
now
if
even
never
before
he
is
sure
to
think
it
is
true
to
believe
those
mischievous
glance
only
rested
on
her
for
a
moment
then
he
looked
away
looked
out
beyond
the
little
terrace
where
was
spread
before
him
as
lovely
a
view
as
mortal
eyes
could
wish
to
behold
the
bright
smiling
landscape
in
front
of
trees
and
fields
and
gardens
here
and
there
dotted
with
graceful
villas
or
pretty
cottages
and
far
away
beyond
the
still
mountains
serene
and
grand
in
their
dazzling
purity
their
tops
melting
away
in
the
few
soft
grey
clouds
which
there
alone
at
the
horizon
broke
the
deep
even
azure
of
the
sky
two
minutes
before
ralph
had
been
admiring
all
this
intensely
what
had
come
over
it
now
the
brightness
seemed
to
have
suddenly
gone
out
of
the
sunlight
there
was
a
dull
grey
look
over
all
what
was
it
that
had
thus
changed
the
world
to
him
ah
what
was
it
he
knew
it
now
knew
for
the
first
time
fully
and
clearly
not
merely
that
he
loved
this
girl
beside
him
but
far
more
than
that
knew
now
in
the
depth
of
the
agony
which
it
cost
him
to
realize
that
he
must
lose
her
knew
for
the
first
time
how
he
loved
her
for
a
minute
or
two
no
one
spoke
ralph
could
not
have
uttered
a
word
had
he
tried
a
curious
feeling
almost
of
suffocation
for
a
few
moments
oppressed
him
but
it
gradually
passed
off
then
he
rose
said
something
of
being
later
than
he
thought
shook
hands
with
marion
now
busy
again
with
her
substantial
rainbow
and
left
the
little
terrace
as
he
passed
through
the
there
lay
archer
on
her
comfortable
sofa
fast
asleep

much

about
nothing
sir
ralph
did
not
go
to
the
next
day
nor
for
several
days
after
that
how
he
got
through
them
he
could
not
have
told
though
probably
none
of
those
about
him
saw
in
him
any
change
or
traces
of
disturbance
of
any
kind
he
heard
florence
speaking
to
his
mother
mention
that
captain
berwick
had
returned
and
he
fancied
there
was
a
hidden
meaning
in
her
tone
as
she
said
it
but
yet
it
did
not
somehow
interest
him
it
seemed
already
a
long
time
ago
since
that
afternoon
on
the
terrace
and
he
was
so
utterly
absorbed
and
engrossed
by
his
own
feelings
just
at
this
time
that
outward
things
did
not
readily
come
home
to
him
he
felt
as
if
it
were
already
all
over
the
same
moment
which
revealed
the
depth
of
his
love
for
marion
had
burnt
into
him
the
conviction
that
she
was
lost
to
him
he
knew
that
his
staying
away
for
three
days
from
the
house
which
had
of
late
become
an
almost
daily
resort
to
him
could
not
but
be
observed
and
commented
upon
but
he
did
not
care
just
now
he
was
suffering
too
newly
and
acutely
to
be
very
sensitive
to
lesser
annoyances
and
it
seemed
a
matter
of
small
consequence
that
his
behaviour
should
appear
inconsistent
or
eccentric
as
it
happened
however
his
conduct
was
not
discussed
or
in
any
way
commented
upon
by
archer
and
her
young
friend
cissy
had
been
ill
for
two
or
three
days
so
ill
as
to
be
unable
to
leave
her
room
and
though
all
time
out
of
school
hours
had
been
spent
in
nursing
her
they
had
neither
of
them
felt
inclined
for
much
conversation
ralph
heard
of
the
poor
little
illness
quite
accidentally
at
luncheon
on
the
third
day
since
his
memorable
visit
sybil
asked
if
she
might
go
round
by
the
market
in
her
walk
to
buy
some
fresh
flowers
too
late
for
fresh
flowers
said
miss
vyse
and
do
you
want
them
for
asked
lady
severn
the
little
mamma
grandmamma
answered
sybil
has
been
ill
for
two
days
and
miss
freer
said
she
was
going
to
get
up
this
afternoon
and
she
wanted
to
get
some
flowers
to
make
the
pretty
but
she
time
to
go
round
by
the
so
she
left
orders
with
you
to
do
so
said
lady
severn
sarcastically
i
must
say
miss
ideas
of
what
is
fitting
and
becoming
are
peculiar
to
say
the
least
to
think
of
my
granddaughters
being
sent
all
over
the
town
to
execute
her
commissions
grandmamma
exclaimed
sybil
on
the
point
of
bursting
into
tears
that
way
at
indeed
added
lofty
coming
to
the
rescue
was
sybil
herself
thought
of
it
and
i
said
i
would
ask
but
she
said
she
would
because
when
we
looked
at
our
money
i
had
only
my
gold
napoleon
and
no
little
money
and
she
had
two
so
we
fixed
she
should
be
the
one
to
buy
are
very
rude
to
interrupt
in
that
way
charlotte
said
her
grandmother
severely
you
and
sybil
are
by
no
means
changed
for
the
better
lately
in
your
at
which
lotty
looked
resentful
but
far
from
penitent
you
both
get
up
early
take
you
to
the
market
myself
before
breakfast
said
ralph
the
flowers
are
sure
to
be
this
proposal
was
received
with
delight
by
both
children
who
scampered
off
to
consult
the
equally
amiable
sister
of
thérèse
as
to
the
best
means
of
ensuring
their
waking
by
sunrise
then
ralph
roused
himself
and
set
out
for
a
solitary
walk
he
went
first
in
the
direction
of
house
intending
to
enquire
at
the
door
if
she
were
better
without
going
in
but
as
he
entered
the
street
in
which
it
was
situated
he
met
charlie
and
thérèse
from
whom
he
obtained
the
information
that
madame
was
much
better
so
much
better
that
mademoiselle
was
going
to
let
her
get
up
this
afternoon
sir
ralph
expressed
his
gratification
at
the
good
news
sure
you
tell
your
mamma
charlie
said
he
i
was
coming
to
ask
for
her
when
i
met
you
and
give
her
my
very
kind
regards
and
say
i
hope
she
will
soon
be
quite
remember
said
charlie
kind
regards
and
hopes
soon
be
well
and
what
am
i
so
say
to
madymuzelle
may
you
know
what
am
i
to
say
to
her
best
love
prettier
than
kind
regards
i
always
send
my
best
you
said
ralph
you
see
a
little
chap
best
love
half
so
pretty
when
people
are
it
said
the
child
dubiously
but
ralph
patted
his
cheek
and
walked
on
as
he
drew
near
house
he
saw
a
gentleman
come
out
of
it
and
walk
on
in
front
of
him
it
was
captain
berwick
he
had
only
been
leaving
some
books
at
the
door
which
his
sister
had
sent
to
amuse
the
invalid
but
this
of
course
ralph
could
not
know
and
though
he
thought
he
had
suffered
in
these
two
days
all
that
was
possible
to
endure
he
found
that
the
sight
of
his
successful
quitting
the
house
after
enjoying
in
all
probability
a
with
marion
added
a
fresh
pang
to
all
he
had
already
undergone
frank
had
not
seen
him
and
he
might
easily
have
escaped
his
notice
but
a
strange
impulse
urged
him
forward
he
walked
rapidly
and
overtook
him
just
as
he
reached
the
corner
of
the
street
the
young
man
looked
surprised
but
responded
cordially
enough
to
his
greeting
back
again
at
altes
said
ralph
for
want
of
anything
better
to
say
frank
did
not
deny
the
fact
he
replied
day
before
yesterday
i
turned
up
again
been
away
too
i
hear
dear
yes
for
ever
so
long
i
left
before
you
did
indeed
i
did
not
know
till
my
return
that
you
had
not
been
here
all
the
seem
wonderfully
interested
in
each
movements
observed
frank
as
they
walked
on
with
rather
an
awkward
laugh
he
evidently
for
some
reason
or
other
did
not
feel
particularly
comfortable
in
his
present
society
ralph
did
not
reply
and
for
a
minute
or
two
there
was
silence
suddenly
the
same
uncontrollable
impulse
again
seized
him
and
he
did
not
resist
it
absurd
he
thought
on
in
this
way
it
will
be
a
ghastly
satisfaction
to
hear
it
confirmed
by
his
own
he
turned
to
frank
me
berwick
if
i
am
have
certainly
not
yet
heard
it
formally
am
right
am
i
not
in
congratulating
you
frank
looked
confused
and
exceedingly
surprised
a
cloud
of
not
small
annoyance
began
to
creep
up
over
his
handsome
face
must
excuse
me
severn
but
i
the
remotest
idea
what
you
are
talking
about
on
what
pray
it
was
intensely
disagreeable
for
ralph
the
last
man
on
earth
to
pry
into
or
gossip
about
his
affairs
who
indeed
carried
to
such
an
extreme
his
sensitive
horror
of
intrusion
his
shy
avoidance
of
all
matters
of
personal
interest
that
in
a
general
way
his
nearest
friend
might
have
lost
a
fortune
or
gained
a
wife
without
his
appearing
to
have
heard
of
the
event
he
would
have
given
worlds
to
have
made
some
half
apology
to
have
shuffled
out
of
it
with
some
muttered
words
of
have
been
a
mistake
or
a
piece
of
the
usual
altes
gossip
which
captain
berwick
must
but
he
was
determined
to
have
done
with
it
and
drove
himself
on
remorselessly
your
marriage
he
said
quietly
rather
i
should
say
on
your
engagement
to
be
whom
asked
frank
in
a
constrained
voice
miss
freer
replied
ralph
who
told
you
asked
frank
again
one
in
particular
answered
ralph
beginning
to
chafe
under
all
this
heard
it
in
several
quarters
and
you
may
be
sure
i
felt
no
doubt
of
the
truth
of
the
report
or
i
certainly
would
not
have
motioned
any
young
name
as
i
have
just
now
he
spoke
stiffly
he
could
not
understand
behaviour
but
his
bewilderment
changed
to
utter
astonishment
when
suddenly
captain
berwick
turned
round
upon
him
one
in
particular
you
say
sir
ralph
severn
told
you
this
piece
of
news
then
perhaps
you
will
be
so
good
as
till
this
friend
of
yours
one
in
particular
that
he
or
she
will
do
better
in
future
to
refrain
in
the
first
place
from
believing
and
in
the
second
place
from
circulating
such
idle
and
mischievous
tales
for
which
there
is
no
foundation
whatever
in
fact
as
to
whether
this
piece
of
advice
may
not
with
peculiar
propriety
be
extended
to
yourself
i
leave
you
to
so
saying
he
bowed
stiffly
his
face
flushed
with
excitement
and
indignation
and
turning
sharply
in
an
opposite
direction
left
ralph
to
pursue
his
walk
alone
the
whole
interview
had
passed
so
rapidly
that
ralph
felt
thoroughly
confused
frank
had
left
him
no
time
to
reply
to
his
extraordinary
outburst
and
indeed
had
he
done
so
ralph
would
hardly
have
known
what
to
say
he
did
not
feel
angry
and
would
have
been
ready
enough
to
apologise
for
however
unintentionally
hurt
or
annoyed
his
companion
though
really
it
was
difficult
to
see
in
what
way
he
had
done
so
as
he
walked
on
slowly
his
thoughts
began
gradually
to
emerge
from
their
bewilderment
and
to
take
the
only
form
by
which
it
appeared
to
him
that
the
riddle
could
be
explained
frank
was
ashamed
of
himself
he
had
gone
too
far
with
miss
freer
and
at
the
last
had
dishonourably
withdrawn
no
wonder
the
mention
of
this
report
put
him
in
a
passion
no
wonder
indeed
ralph
ground
his
teeth
as
for
one
passing
moment
he
wished
he
were
brother
this
explained
it
all
her
altered
looks
her
variable
spirits
her
painful
agitation
at
the
mention
if
captain
return
poor
little
governess
this
then
was
the
price
she
had
to
pay
for
her
womanly
and
honest
independence
of
spirit
for
ralph
had
gathered
from
remarks
that
during
her
stay
at
altes
there
had
been
no
positive
necessity
for
exertions
but
that
she
had
great
a
notion
of
it
must
have
been
that
mother
and
sisters
of
his
looking
down
upon
her
because
she
was
a
daily
governess
looking
down
on
her
thought
ralph
to
himself
only
i
could
set
ever
thing
at
defiance
and
brave
the
future
even
now
i
feel
as
if
i
should
like
to
snatch
her
away
from
all
those
horrid
people
and
devote
my
life
to
making
her
happy
but
and
with
the
his
mood
changed
care
for
me
oh
frank
berwick
what
a
weak
contemptible
fool
you
are
for
he
did
care
for
am
sure
of
but
hardly
had
his
reflections
reached
this
point
when
they
were
interrupted
hasty
steps
behind
him
which
his
absorption
had
prevented
his
hearing
as
they
drew
nearer
and
in
another
moment
there
stood
frank
berwick
beside
him
his
face
still
flushed
but
more
now
from
eagerness
than
annoyance
and
with
a
look
of
resolution
about
it
too
he
began
abruptly
behaved
like
a
fool
just
now
but
i
was
most
intensely
annoyed
as
you
will
understand
when
you
hear
what
i
have
got
to
say
i
want
to
tell
you
something
rather
a
queer
thing
to
do
i
know
but
it
seems
to
me
we
have
all
been
playing
at
cross
purposes
and
i
shall
feel
better
satisfied
if
i
tell
you
there
is
not
another
man
living
i
think
that
i
would
trust
as
i
am
going
to
let
you
see
i
trust
he
stopped
rather
awkwardly
for
ralph
had
not
by
glance
or
gesture
encouraged
him
to
proceed
now
however
he
could
hardly
avoid
saying
something
i
can
be
of
use
to
you
captain
berwick
he
said
coldly
shall
be
glad
to
do
what
i
can
but
remember
a
stranger
can
seldom
do
much
good
by
meddling
among
relations
if
that
as
i
suspect
is
what
you
want
of
frank
smiled
see
what
driving
at
he
said
that
confirms
me
in
resolving
to
set
you
right
for
my
own
sake
if
for
no
other
you
think
severn
i
see
plainly
that
my
very
evident
use
no
stronger
the
young
lady
you
mentioned
a
short
time
ago
have
resulted
in
what
you
rather
rashly
congratulated
me
upon
just
now
had
it
not
been
for
some
backwardness
on
my
part
fear
of
my
opposition
or
some
such
obstacle
you
are
quite
mistaken
i
am
in
no
way
dependent
on
my
parents
i
have
a
good
appointment
in
india
and
need
consult
no
one
as
to
whom
i
marry
nor
indeed
would
my
people
have
opposed
me
in
this
of
that
i
am
quite
sure
did
it
never
strike
you
severn
that
there
might
be
another
way
of
accounting
for
the
present
state
of
affairs
which
you
evidently
think
satisfactory
you
have
been
blaming
me
suppose
you
find
i
am
more
to
be
pitied
than
blamed
not
a
pleasant
thing
to
tell
severn
but
this
is
the
actual
state
of
the
case
i
did
offer
myself
and
all
that
i
had
in
the
world
to
miss
freer
most
distinctly
and
unmistakeably
it
certainly
was
not
much
to
offer
but
such
as
it
was
it
was
most
honestly
laid
before
her
to
take
or
leave
and
she
chose
the
latter
repeated
ralph
as
if
he
hardly
understood
what
frank
was
saying
the
latter
in
plain
english
severn
she
have
me
refused
me
decidedly
unmistakeably
but
all
the
same
she
did
it
in
such
a
way
that
though
rejecting
me
as
a
lover
she
kept
me
as
a
friend
and
a
feat
few
women
can
perform
her
friend
indeed
she
has
none
does
honour
not
only
to
her
berwick
said
ralph
warmly
still
more
to
you
but
when
did
all
this
happen
he
asked
eagerly
adding
in
the
same
breath
me
i
have
no
right
to
ask
such
are
perfectly
welcome
to
the
whole
story
said
frank
too
much
in
earnest
to
stand
on
much
ceremony
fact
that
you
should
hear
the
whole
story
was
my
object
in
telling
you
any
when
did
it
happen
oh
ages
ago
i
thought
i
had
begun
to
get
over
it
a
little
till
you
touched
the
tender
place
just
now
it
was
on
the
night
of
the
second
ball
you
remember
the
day
before
you
went
did
he
not
remember
now
comes
the
part
of
the
whole
i
most
want
to
tell
you
went
on
frank
yet
the
hardest
to
even
hint
to
you
i
fervently
hope
i
am
not
doing
wrong
but
i
am
sure
i
can
trust
you
severn
just
now
when
i
lost
my
temper
it
was
not
merely
mortification
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
it
was
indignation
against
what
on
earth
for
ralph
in
amazement
you
see
but
of
course
you
if
you
did
you
require
me
to
tell
you
i
was
furious
at
you
very
much
in
the
same
way
that
you
were
furious
at
me
i
declare
severn
he
broke
out
half
smiling
but
impatiently
seeing
that
the
look
of
bewilderment
did
not
in
the
least
clear
from
face
declare
you
are
very
dense
i
know
very
learned
and
clever
but
i
must
say
you
are
uncommonly
stupid
too
you
see
he
repeated
were
indignant
with
me
thinking
i
had
been
trifling
with
the
best
and
sweetest
girl
in
the
world
well
i
was
angry
because
i
thought
the
very
same
thing
of
the
light
began
to
break
on
ralph
but
very
faintly
as
yet
understand
you
to
some
extent
he
said
surely
i
so
much
older
and
graver
than
altes
gossip
might
leave
me
it
said
frank
but
it
altes
gossip
i
am
talking
about
to
speak
plainly
severn
for
you
drive
me
to
it
when
severn
she
you
know
who
refused
me
it
did
not
require
much
penetration
to
discover
she
had
the
best
of
reasons
she
is
no
coquette
and
she
is
very
young
only
one
thing
had
blinded
her
to
my
feelings
towards
her
otherwise
she
would
never
have
found
it
in
her
gentle
heart
to
let
them
go
so
far
unchecked
and
this
thing
was
her
own
devotion
to
another
you
see
it
now
severn
no
wonder
i
blamed
you
you
the
luckiest
man
on
earth
for
i
knew
she
was
not
the
sort
of
girl
to
have
given
her
affection
unsought
and
that
night
when
you
came
to
tell
her
you
were
leaving
altes
in
that
sudden
cruel
way
i
could
have
done
i
know
what
to
you
severn
till
i
never
doubted
you
knew
it
you
see
you
went
there
pretty
often
and
that
for
you
said
a
good
deal
altogether
no
one
but
yourself
could
have
made
me
believe
you
were
so
blind
if
i
have
been
mistaken
severn
in
believing
that
you
cared
for
her
for
sake
do
not
misuse
what
i
have
confided
to
you
by
amusing
yourself
at
her
expense
though
after
all
i
can
not
quite
believe
i
have
been
mistaken
he
added
anxiously
deserve
my
secret
berwick
said
ralph
in
a
voice
that
was
husky
in
spite
of
his
efforts
are
a
good
fellow
and
i
see
your
motive
you
shall
have
my
secret
you
were
not
mistaken
there
now
remember
that
however
strange
my
after
conduct
may
seem
to
you
i
shall
whatever
i
may
be
forced
to
do
think
more
of
her
happiness
than
of
my
own
goodbye
for
the
present
and
thank
you
he
said
earnestly
as
they
shook
hands
hastily
and
separated
frank
sailed
for
india
three
days
after
before
he
went
however
he
took
pity
on
the
devotion
of
dora
bailey
to
her
and
was
of
course
accepted
poor
frank
he
was
not
altogether
of
the
stuff
of
which
heroes
of
romance
are
made
though
one
deed
of
his
life
had
at
least
according
to
the
standard
in
such
matters
somewhat
savoured
of
the
heroic
he
made
one
stipulation
however
with
the
enraptured
dora
she
was
to
tell
no
one
of
the
engagement
for
two
months
to
come
at
the
end
of
which
time
he
promised
to
write
to
her
father
whose
consent
he
did
not
anticipate
much
difficulty
in
obtaining
and
to
make
arrangements
for
her
joining
him
in
india
under
suitable
escort
it
was
rather
hard
upon
dora
but
she
was
too
much
in
awe
of
him
and
too
grateful
for
his
immense
condescension
to
dream
of
opposing
him
though
she
thought
to
herself
very
nice
it
would
have
been
to
announce
my
engagement
before
every
one
leaves
altes
for
the
summer
particularly
to
that
miss
freer
who
has
done
her
best
to
lure
him
away
from
she
would
have
had
no
objection
to
being
married
on
the
spot
and
setting
off
with
him
then
and
there
which
considering
it
would
have
involved
the
going
without
a
trousseau
and
all
its
delightful
attendants
proves
that
she
was
very
deeply
in
love
not
a
bad
little
thing
in
her
way
said
frank
to
himself
rather
too
much
of
a
goose
and
certainly
a
long
way
better
than
anything
i
could
have
picked
up
in
india
so
on
the
whole
the
best
thing
i
can
do
for
i
stand
much
more
of
that
horrible
bachelor
life
out
but
as
for
marrying
her
on
the
spot
no
he
was
not
quite
ready
for
that
other
things
as
yet
were
too
fresh
though
after
a
time
and
a
few
mouths
of
unsatisfactory
lonely
life
in
india
he
being
domestic
in
his
tastes
hoped
to
be
able
to
work
up
to
a
moderate
amount
of
love
for
the
silly
affectionate
baby
pretty
and
any
way
i
know
she
cares
for
me
which
is
always
something
and
not
likely
ever
to
have
a
hotter
chance
if
as
and
when
the
time
came
to
say
goodbye
he
really
felt
more
sorry
to
part
with
her
than
he
could
have
believed
possible
and
he
whispered
to
her
that
the
period
of
separation
should
not
be
a
long
one
if
it
was
in
his
power
to
shorten
it
when
frank
left
him
ralph
still
walked
on
mechanically
for
he
was
quite
unaware
what
direction
he
was
following
or
how
far
he
had
gone
his
whole
being
was
shaken
to
its
centre
he
could
see
clearly
along
no
line
of
thought
all
was
confusion
what
had
he
done
what
should
he
do
duty
and
inclination
prudence
and
generosity
warred
against
each
other
worse
than
this
one
duty
took
up
arms
against
another
and
which
to
consider
victorious
he
could
not
decide
all
his
past
convictions
as
to
what
was
right
and
wise
for
him
firm
and
sound
as
he
had
thought
them
were
suddenly
uprooted
and
thrown
in
his
face
by
the
new
claims
not
merely
on
his
inclination
but
on
his
honour
which
communication
had
revealed
to
him
his
was
one
of
those
morbidly
conscientious
natures
which
persist
in
always
erecting
barriers
between
the
right
and
the
pleasant
often
no
doubt
barriers
are
planted
there
already
by
higher
hands
than
ours
in
which
case
all
we
can
do
is
to
submit
and
make
the
best
of
the
thorny
road
but
ralph
and
others
like
him
could
not
feel
content
with
he
could
hardly
believe
that
duty
sometimes
wears
an
attractive
form
that
sometimes
it
is
meet
and
lawful
for
us
to
gather
the
roses
blooming
by
the
way
and
to
saunter
for
awhile
on
the
suit
and
inviting
pastures
there
to
refresh
our
weary
feet
had
he
not
known
and
felt
how
entirely
and
intensely
he
cared
for
marion
he
could
in
one
way
have
decided
more
easily
he
said
to
himself
though
in
so
thinking
he
erred
for
had
he
cared
for
her
less
he
could
have
offered
her
nothing
meet
for
her
acceptance
of
one
like
him
the
fullest
deepest
love
would
alone
be
worthy
of
the
name
at
all
but
the
thought
of
winning
her
was
so
unspeakably
tempting
that
he
doubted
himself
is
all
abominable
selfishness
he
said
to
himself
have
no
right
to
think
of
it
no
man
has
less
right
to
dream
of
marriage
than
i
in
all
probability
i
should
only
be
dragging
her
into
a
life
of
struggling
anxiety
far
worse
to
bear
than
her
present
dependence
for
then
she
might
have
others
to
care
for
and
for
whom
she
would
kill
herself
with
anxiety
she
is
that
sort
of
woman
i
know
if
i
want
a
wife
i
should
choose
a
not
over
sensitive
managing
young
which
all
the
same
heaven
preserve
me
who
would
be
good
at
living
on
next
to
nothing
for
to
all
appearances
that
is
about
what
i
should
have
to
offer
all
most
reasonable
and
true
if
such
indeed
were
his
circumstances
whispered
a
mischievous
little
voice
it
true
that
this
poor
marion
loves
you
as
you
love
you
any
right
to
condemn
her
too
to
the
suffering
you
yourself
for
your
manhood
find
hard
enough
to
bear
then
the
battle
all
began
over
again
with
small
prospect
of
being
quickly
or
satisfactorily
concluded
but
there
came
an
interruption
this
walk
was
indeed
to
be
an
eventful
one
to
sir
ralph
he
was
hastening
on
walking
faster
than
usual
as
was
his
habit
when
agitated
or
perplexed
when
turning
sharply
a
corner
of
the
road
he
came
suddenly
upon
price
sauntering
along
an
open
book
in
his
hand
of
which
he
read
a
little
from
time
to
time
how
peaceful
and
at
rest
he
looked
the
picture
of
a
calm
emotionless
student
undisturbed
by
the
passions
and
anxieties
by
which
ordinary
mortals
are
tossed
and
torn
true
so
far
for
now
in
his
autumn
his
life
was
even
and
colourless
enough
but
it
had
not
always
been
so
there
were
furrows
his
brow
deep
lines
round
the
sensitive
mouth
which
told
that
he
too
had
fought
his
battles
had
loved
and
sorrowed
like
his
fellows
ralph
he
exclaimed
with
a
bright
look
of
pleasure
delighted
i
am
to
have
met
you
out
on
a
solitary
ramble
like
myself
have
you
any
objection
to
my
joining
you
what
a
lovely
day
is
it
not
not
nearly
so
oppressively
hot
as
it
has
been
but
which
way
are
you
going
way
you
like
said
ralph
quite
the
same
to
me
i
am
merely
taking
a
constitutional
as
you
see
with
a
forced
laugh
then
said
the
tutor
on
whose
quick
ears
neither
the
tone
nor
the
laugh
fell
disregarded
you
have
no
choice
suppose
we
cross
the
road
and
return
to
altes
by
that
lane
opposite
not
much
of
a
round
three
to
four
miles
will
bring
us
home
and
pleasanter
than
the
dusty
you
replied
ralph
will
do
very
and
they
walked
on
for
some
little
time
in
silence
suddenly
ralph
remembered
himself
am
afraid
price
you
find
me
very
good
company
i
am
thoroughly
out
of
sorts
mentally
that
is
to
say
i
am
wretchedly
unhappy
because
i
see
my
way
before
me
i
want
to
do
right
and
i
can
not
find
out
which
way
before
me
it
lies
i
say
as
much
as
this
to
anyone
else
but
i
know
of
old
how
i
can
trust
you
and
i
want
you
to
think
my
queer
behaviour
arise
from
any
other
is
no
queer
behaviour
in
your
treating
me
as
an
old
friend
my
dear
boy
answered
price
just
as
you
are
inclined
if
you
wish
to
talk
keep
silence
it
is
a
pleasure
to
me
to
have
a
quiet
hour
with
you
whether
you
talk
or
not
but
at
the
same
time
my
dear
sir
ralph
i
am
an
older
man
by
many
years
than
you
and
my
life
has
not
been
all
smooth
sailing
it
is
just
possible
i
might
be
able
to
suggest
you
even
being
so
much
older
he
added
apologetically
you
should
think
fit
to
take
me
into
your
confidence
as
to
your
present
ralph
made
no
answer
price
looked
penitent
trust
you
think
me
officious
or
presumptuous
he
began
me
sir
one
thing
to
please
me
price
said
his
pupil
all
about
that
let
me
be
plain
ralph
again
for
a
while
to
you
at
least
it
will
make
it
easier
for
me
to
confess
all
my
sins
to
you
as
if
i
were
a
lad
price
smiled
at
his
fancy
you
have
any
sins
to
confess
my
dear
ralph
he
said
will
not
be
like
old
times
i
shall
never
have
another
like
never
he
added
affectionately
you
call
it
a
sin
replied
ralph
not
so
much
the
better
all
the
same
for
me
if
not
a
sin
it
was
a
piece
of
inexcusable
folly
you
would
never
guess
what
i
have
done
i
not
asked
he
drily
you
quite
sure
of
that
sure
answered
ralph
one
would
believe
it
of
me
this
is
what
i
have
done
price
i
have
fallen
in
love
like
any
unfledged
boy
or
rather
not
like
that
at
all
for
that
would
be
a
passing
affair
which
to
my
sorrow
and
my
joy
in
one
mine
is
not
it
is
very
sober
earnest
with
me
price
it
is
indeed
the
whole
of
everything
is
changed
to
me
and
what
to
do
how
to
act
i
can
not
for
the
life
of
me
the
young
lady
put
in
price
the
young
lady
the
worst
of
it
the
worst
and
the
best
i
am
horribly
afraid
horribly
yet
at
the
bottom
of
my
selfish
heart
intensely
unspeakably
delighted
to
think
so
i
say
that
she
my
poor
dear
child
has
been
no
wiser
than
i
is
it
possible
price
do
you
think
it
possible
that
any
sweet
lovely
girl
could
care
for
me
ugly
stupid
and
unattractive
as
i
am
i
can
hardly
believe
it
and
it
was
rather
difficult
for
price
to
help
laughing
at
most
original
way
of
making
his
confession
but
in
pity
to
his
unmistakable
earnestness
he
controlled
himself
and
said
gravely
ralph
i
do
think
it
possible
very
possible
that
such
a
girl
as
you
describe
may
care
for
you
as
you
deserve
to
be
cared
for
and
if
i
am
right
in
what
i
suppose
i
think
you
a
wise
and
fortunate
man
fortunate
in
having
obtained
wise
in
having
sought
for
the
love
of
that
young
girl
for
she
is
not
one
to
love
lightly
she
is
a
sweet
true
girl
and
she
will
be
an
even
sweeter
woman
i
pity
you
ralph
if
your
choice
as
i
suspect
has
fallen
on
marion
have
guessed
rightly
said
ralph
how
you
came
to
do
so
passes
my
comprehension
but
you
understand
it
all
yet
price
and
fortunate
you
call
me
the
former
i
certainly
have
not
been
in
this
matter
to
tell
the
truth
i
never
thought
about
it
till
the
mischief
was
done
fortunate
most
wonderfully
so
i
should
indeed
consider
myself
were
i
free
to
avail
myself
of
this
good
fortune
my
dear
boy
exclaimed
price
confess
i
understand
you
why
are
you
not
so
you
are
of
age
your
own
master
to
a
sufficient
extent
to
marry
when
and
where
you
choose
it
is
all
very
well
to
think
of
pleasing
your
mother
but
you
and
she
have
not
lived
so
much
together
as
to
be
in
any
way
dependent
on
each
other
in
the
way
that
some
mothers
and
sons
are
probably
lady
severn
might
not
consider
miss
freer
suitable
as
to
position
and
all
that
but
no
one
can
look
at
her
and
not
see
that
she
is
a
lady
and
beyond
that
i
do
not
see
that
lady
severn
is
called
on
to
do
i
said
ralph
she
thinks
she
is
but
mistake
me
it
is
no
over
regard
to
my
prejudices
that
is
influencing
me
it
is
sheer
necessity
this
is
the
actual
state
of
the
case
am
utterly
and
entirely
dependent
upon
my
mother
not
one
shilling
not
one
farthing
of
my
own
do
i
either
possess
at
present
or
have
i
any
certainty
of
ever
possessing
how
then
can
i
think
myself
free
to
marry
to
involve
another
in
such
galling
dependence
on
my
caprices
though
truly
speaking
hitherto
the
dependence
has
not
galled
me
particularly
it
affected
no
one
but
myself
and
till
now
it
never
occurred
to
me
how
terribly
it
might
complicate
price
stopped
and
looked
at
the
speaker
with
an
air
of
extreme
bewilderment
now
my
dear
ralph
he
said
clearly
follow
you
in
what
is
your
position
different
from
your
john
married
to
please
himself
as
far
as
i
remember
lady
severn
did
not
particularly
fancy
the
bruce
connection
but
then
she
was
too
sensible
to
oppose
it
knowing
as
she
did
that
in
the
end
all
would
be
his
you
mean
i
suppose
that
the
amount
of
your
yearly
allowance
depends
on
her
goodwill
but
if
i
remember
rightly
this
was
settled
permanently
when
john
came
of
age
and
i
never
before
doubted
that
you
were
now
in
receipt
as
a
matter
of
course
or
what
had
been
his
besides
in
any
case
the
whole
must
be
yours
eventually
it
is
only
a
question
of
a
little
time
you
seem
to
be
forgetting
the
it
repeated
ralph
indeed
though
there
is
little
use
in
remembering
what
no
longer
exists
i
will
explain
it
all
to
you
but
in
the
first
place
as
to
my
allowance
it
is
altogether
an
arbitrary
affair
was
settled
as
you
in
such
a
way
that
he
was
able
to
marry
to
please
himself
without
having
to
go
on
his
knees
for
my
permission
but
then
he
was
the
heir
and
my
favourite
whereas
i
as
you
know
a
mistake
from
the
beginning
in
childhood
and
youth
barely
endured
in
manhood
still
more
unfortunate
in
becoming
the
possessor
or
empty
honours
i
never
wished
for
can
hardly
expect
now
for
the
first
time
to
find
my
mother
ready
to
accede
to
my
wishes
to
agree
in
short
to
what
few
mothers
in
her
position
could
consider
other
than
an
immense
folly
and
mistake
no
price
i
have
thought
it
all
over
calmly
and
dispassionately
my
mother
would
never
consent
to
my
marrying
a
governess
i
think
she
cares
about
money
to
do
her
justice
she
is
not
mercenary
but
the
thought
of
my
wire
having
been
a
governess
she
could
never
get
the
entail
put
in
price
about
that
you
mean
to
say
you
consented
to
its
being
broken
replied
ralph
do
mean
to
say
so
the
entail
no
longer
exists
that
part
of
the
affair
i
have
in
a
sense
no
one
but
myself
to
thank
for
this
was
how
it
happened
it
was
soon
after
horrible
time
you
know
when
my
mother
was
really
mad
with
grief
and
the
whole
household
shocked
and
upset
by
the
accident
and
its
dreadful
result
i
came
home
just
in
time
to
see
him
die
he
was
hardly
conscious
but
he
whispered
something
when
they
told
him
i
was
there
i
could
not
catch
the
words
but
my
mother
said
it
was
an
appeal
to
me
to
be
good
to
his
children
very
probably
it
was
well
after
his
death
my
mother
fell
ill
and
made
up
her
mind
that
she
too
was
going
to
die
she
was
in
a
frightfully
low
nervous
state
and
her
mind
preyed
on
the
notion
that
these
children
lotty
and
sybil
were
going
to
be
left
to
my
tender
mercies
and
that
i
verily
believe
i
would
turn
them
out
into
the
streets
of
course
they
were
utterly
unprovided
for
and
as
things
were
could
not
be
made
independent
so
nothing
would
satisfy
her
but
the
breaking
of
the
entail
to
which
i
miserable
enough
at
being
thus
forced
into
my
place
and
at
seeing
how
every
one
wished
i
had
been
thrown
from
my
horse
instead
of
him
was
only
too
ready
to
consent
it
was
done
and
a
portion
of
ten
thousand
pounds
each
was
raised
for
my
nieces
then
the
estate
was
resettled
giving
back
to
my
mother
of
course
her
former
according
to
her
only
hers
for
life
ralph
interrupted
the
tutor
will
all
be
yours
in
the
end
i
survive
her
said
ralph
if
not
and
if
i
marry
without
her
approval
what
then
why
my
unfortunate
widow
and
yet
more
unfortunate
children
would
be
simply
beggars
not
one
farthing
of
all
she
has
would
got
to
them
save
she
gave
it
of
free
gift
which
thing
price
in
such
a
case
she
would
never
do
i
am
not
exaggerating
the
state
of
the
case
i
know
my
mother
good
points
as
well
as
her
weak
i
am
not
reckoning
without
my
host
very
lately
she
has
told
me
her
mind
on
the
subject
of
my
possible
marriage
told
it
me
plainly
enough
and
i
know
what
i
have
to
expect
if
i
marry
to
please
her
she
will
i
know
act
most
liberally
if
not
all
i
can
look
for
depends
on
the
contingency
of
my
surviving
her
she
has
not
actually
threatened
to
stop
my
allowance
unless
i
marry
as
she
wishes
but
she
very
nearly
did
so
and
i
may
tell
you
price
added
ralph
his
dark
cheek
flushing
darker
my
marrying
to
please
her
is
utterly
and
entirely
out
of
the
question
she
is
bewitched
i
think
but
thank
heaven
i
am
not
if
had
but
a
certainty
however
small
i
would
marry
if
my
sweet
marion
would
have
me
and
leave
florence
vyse
to
the
enjoyment
of
all
she
can
extract
from
my
poor
mother
for
that
is
all
she
wants
my
money
not
me
but
unfortunately
she
sees
that
through
me
she
might
best
secure
the
whitelake
estate
asked
price
surely
is
independent
of
lady
replied
ralph
was
not
in
my
power
touch
when
he
made
over
all
the
rest
to
his
daughter
it
went
to
my
father
with
the
title
but
unfortunately
between
his
succeeding
to
the
title
and
his
marrying
the
heiress
several
years
intervened
whitelake
was
not
much
of
a
place
to
begin
think
in
its
best
days
it
gave
more
than
some
fifteen
hundred
a
year
and
my
father
mortgaged
it
so
heavily
that
now
the
rents
only
just
cover
the
mortgage
interest
so
that
is
a
merely
illusory
possession
you
see
i
have
nothing
price
nothing
whatever
and
no
certainty
of
ever
having
anything
and
then
though
not
idle
i
am
desultory
at
this
moment
i
see
before
me
no
means
of
gaining
enough
to
marry
upon
even
were
i
more
sure
than
i
am
of
my
own
health
and
strength
and
even
if
i
could
make
up
my
mind
to
risk
the
future
the
present
even
is
barred
to
if
john
had
not
died
ralph
if
you
had
remained
in
your
original
place
as
younger
son
you
are
no
worse
off
than
you
would
have
been
i
am
said
ralph
emphatically
times
worse
off
had
john
lived
some
small
provision
would
have
been
secured
to
me
he
often
talked
of
this
and
i
am
worse
off
in
another
way
at
that
time
i
was
getting
on
fairly
well
and
should
soon
have
risen
higher
i
had
been
vice
consul
at
for
some
time
and
had
a
good
chance
of
succeeding
sir
archibald
eventually
i
liked
the
east
and
it
suited
me
climate
and
everything
i
had
ample
time
for
the
studies
i
liked
best
and
in
my
quiet
stupid
way
i
was
contented
enough
looking
back
on
it
now
i
certainly
wonder
at
he
went
on
dreamily
have
to
my
cost
had
a
shadowy
tantalizing
glimpse
of
something
like
happiness
but
at
the
time
i
believed
myself
to
be
an
exception
to
the
rest
of
mankind
i
thought
myself
perfectly
secure
against
this
sort
of
smiled
half
bitterly
as
he
spoke
see
how
i
am
punished
for
my
price
answered
by
another
question
then
did
you
leave
the
east
i
was
never
quite
sure
of
the
and
entirely
to
please
my
mother
though
she
cared
little
for
me
personally
she
had
a
regard
for
me
as
the
head
of
the
family
and
thought
it
unfitting
that
i
should
spend
my
life
half
buried
alive
out
there
then
the
estate
medhurst
puzzled
her
the
agent
left
and
she
had
to
choose
another
then
too
she
had
that
fit
of
thinking
she
was
going
to
die
altogether
i
seemed
to
have
no
choice
so
i
threw
up
my
appointment
as
you
think
you
did
wrong
ralph
wrong
in
this
way
you
should
not
have
cut
the
ground
from
under
your
feet
in
both
directions
you
should
not
have
thrown
up
your
only
other
chance
without
securing
to
yourself
a
competency
at
home
this
you
might
easily
have
done
at
the
time
the
money
was
raised
for
said
ralph
penitently
see
it
plainly
enough
now
but
at
that
time
i
stood
so
completely
alone
it
never
occurred
to
me
that
i
should
ever
have
to
be
selfish
for
others
there
is
no
use
blaming
you
now
said
price
present
question
is
what
can
you
what
should
you
do
indeed
replied
sir
ralph
you
see
price
how
horribly
complicated
it
is
were
only
i
myself
concerned
i
could
soon
decide
whatever
agony
it
cost
me
but
if
indeed
it
be
true
as
i
have
great
reason
to
believe
for
the
life
of
me
i
be
unselfish
enough
to
say
that
she
is
involved
that
she
cares
for
me
voice
sank
as
he
uttered
the
can
i
do
how
can
i
condemn
another
to
the
suffering
that
it
has
taken
all
my
manhood
to
endure
price
did
not
reply
they
walked
on
for
some
time
in
silence
suddenly
the
elder
man
turned
to
his
companion
with
an
apparently
irrelevant
question
you
see
sir
archibald
when
you
were
in
town
lately
archibald
repeated
ralph
with
surprise
yes
i
saw
him
he
was
very
gracious
and
condescended
to
approve
of
my
notes
on
the
various
patois
about
here
though
of
course
basque
is
his
great
hobby
and
i
have
not
been
able
to
collect
much
new
information
about
that
he
is
leaving
england
again
next
month
he
says
cameron
has
not
been
so
well
i
heard
said
price
i
had
better
tell
you
at
once
what
i
am
thinking
of
i
heard
from
cameron
yesterday
he
is
returning
home
he
stand
the
climate
now
ralph
you
see
your
old
post
will
be
free
again
supposing
sir
archibald
were
willing
to
use
his
interest
for
you
to
get
it
again
would
you
take
it
ralph
did
not
answer
at
once
when
he
did
at
last
speak
it
was
slowly
and
thoughtfully
he
said
think
i
would
that
is
to
say
i
should
like
to
have
the
option
of
it
to
fall
back
upon
i
am
right
in
my
fear
he
added
with
a
smile
you
for
telling
me
of
it
but
what
must
i
do
it
is
not
much
use
writing
to
my
old
chief
it
would
be
much
better
to
see
him
you
think
so
better
i
should
say
from
what
i
know
of
him
if
you
take
my
advice
ralph
you
will
go
over
to
london
as
soon
as
you
can
see
sir
archibald
and
as
you
say
yourself
secure
the
option
of
the
appointment
there
is
no
such
tremendous
hurry
as
cameron
is
not
coming
home
for
a
month
or
two
but
you
should
lose
no
time
in
obtaining
sir
promise
to
get
you
the
refusal
of
it
i
know
the
particulars
of
the
thing
i
suppose
you
could
live
on
it
if
the
worst
came
to
the
worst
and
lady
severn
refused
all
assistance
but
remember
i
am
not
advising
you
to
anything
rash
you
must
if
possible
be
surer
of
your
ground
before
risking
a
quarrel
with
your
nearest
relation
on
the
other
hand
you
have
no
right
to
ask
for
this
young
pledge
till
you
are
sure
of
something
offer
her
it
is
an
awkward
position
a
very
awkward
position
he
repeated
price
said
ralph
eagerly
you
mean
to
say
that
were
i
obtaining
this
small
certainty
for
the
present
i
should
be
justified
in
marrying
could
certainly
live
on
my
pay
out
there
comfortably
enough
i
dare
say
but
the
future
what
about
that
price
looked
very
grave
trust
i
am
not
advising
you
badly
my
dear
boy
i
can
only
tell
you
what
i
think
it
seems
to
me
that
if
you
and
this
young
lady
do
really
care
for
each
other
as
i
believe
you
i
and
my
poor
little
margaret
cared
for
each
other
fifteen
years
ago
he
said
with
a
gentle
smile
this
case
he
went
on
think
you
should
to
some
extent
brave
the
future
the
probability
of
your
not
surviving
your
mother
is
small
and
i
can
not
help
feeling
more
sanguine
than
you
appear
about
the
way
she
would
act
if
she
were
once
convinced
your
decision
was
irrevocable
lady
severn
i
have
good
reason
to
know
is
and
conscientious
though
i
must
allow
prejudiced
and
perhaps
naturally
so
you
think
it
would
be
well
to
make
an
appeal
to
her
before
doing
anything
else
i
said
ralph
present
it
could
do
no
good
and
might
do
great
harm
if
i
told
her
anything
i
must
tell
all
and
imagine
the
horrors
of
her
name
being
bandied
about
and
insulted
by
my
mother
and
miss
vyse
for
that
girl
hears
everything
i
have
a
dreadful
idea
that
her
suspicions
are
already
aroused
besides
i
should
feel
myself
so
much
stronger
to
lay
the
case
before
my
mother
if
i
felt
i
had
something
else
to
fall
back
upon
it
would
prove
to
her
that
i
was
most
thoroughly
in
earnest
no
my
first
step
must
be
to
see
my
old
just
then
their
roads
parted
they
separated
with
a
hearty
shake
of
the
hand
and
a
few
strong
words
of
thanks
from
ralph
for
his
former
sympathy
and
advice
will
let
me
know
how
it
all
ends
my
dear
ralph
said
price
as
he
left
him
certainly
but
i
shall
see
you
again
is
doubtful
replied
the
tutor
any
day
now
the
countess
may
decide
on
leaving
altes
and
if
you
set
off
for
england
in
a
few
days
we
may
be
away
when
you
hope
not
said
ralph
and
then
he
walked
home
quickly
trying
to
arrange
his
plans
in
his
mind
should
much
like
to
be
sure
quite
sure
of
what
berwick
told
me
he
thought
yet
i
see
no
way
of
satisfying
myself
without
risk
of
committing
her
to
more
than
at
present
i
have
a
right
to
ask
but
i
endure
to
go
about
in
an
underhand
way
prying
into
her
innocent
thoughts
and
feelings
and
on
the
other
hand
i
endure
to
think
that
she
may
now
be
suffering
through
my
apparent
coldness
suffering
my
poor
little
for
me
at
that
moment
he
felt
inclined
to
brave
all
and
rush
off
to
on
the
spot
thinking
threw
no
light
on
the
difficulty
all
he
could
decide
upon
was
to
make
immediate
preparations
for
another
visit
to
england
and
for
the
rest
to
be
guided
by
circumstances
and
by
his
honest
determination
to
think
first
and
most
of
her
happiness
notwithstanding
however
all
his
misgivings
and
anxieties
the
ralph
severn
who
ran
lightly
up
the
long
stone
staircase
of
no
was
a
very
different
being
from
the
grave
careworn
man
who
had
slowly
descended
those
same
steps
a
few
hours
previously
chapter
ii
more
than
half
way
me
for
aught
that
ever
i
could
read
could
ever
hear
by
tale
or
history
the
course
of
true
love
never
did
run
midsummer
dream
doute
dans
qui
rêve
la
foi
descend
dans
qui
those
few
days
had
been
dull
enough
for
marion
the
weeks
of
happiness
unquestioning
if
not
thoughtless
that
had
preceded
them
had
ill
prepared
her
for
the
sudden
change
for
that
there
was
a
change
that
some
mysterious
influence
had
come
between
ralph
and
her
she
felt
convinced
at
first
she
was
inclined
to
ascribe
it
to
unlucky
allusion
to
frank
berwick
that
afternoon
on
the
terrace
but
on
further
reflection
she
became
convinced
that
though
this
might
explain
part
it
did
not
throw
light
on
the
whole
if
feelings
to
her
were
merely
as
she
had
for
long
believed
those
of
kindly
almost
pitying
friendliness
there
could
be
no
reason
why
the
suspicion
of
her
attachment
to
another
should
interfere
with
their
pleasant
intercourse
if
on
the
other
hand
as
of
late
she
had
half
unconsciously
begun
to
hope
his
interest
in
her
was
of
a
far
deeper
nature
why
should
he
have
allowed
all
these
weeks
of
almost
daily
intercourse
to
elapse
and
then
suddenly
on
the
mere
shadowy
appearance
of
a
possible
rival
withdraw
without
a
word
of
explanation
offered
or
demanded
no
if
ralph
indeed
for
her
as
she
softly
worded
it
to
herself
there
must
be
some
other
obstacle
in
the
way
some
more
important
influence
at
work
than
any
mistaken
dread
of
the
young
officer
marion
to
some
extent
misunderstood
ralph
she
had
no
idea
of
his
extreme
self
contempt
his
rooted
notion
that
in
all
respects
he
was
utterly
unattractive
and
unlikely
to
win
a
affection
she
in
her
sweet
humility
so
looked
up
to
him
that
she
could
not
realize
his
complete
unconsciousness
of
the
loftiness
of
the
pedestal
on
which
she
had
placed
but
this
obstacle
this
hindrance
in
what
then
did
it
consist
wherein
lay
its
insurmountably
a
more
or
experienced
girl
would
at
once
have
found
an
answer
to
this
question
in
the
fact
of
her
dependent
position
but
with
respect
to
ralph
himself
this
did
not
somehow
occur
to
marion
as
of
much
consequence
yet
she
was
by
no
means
ignorant
of
the
conventional
importance
of
social
position
and
had
indeed
been
keenly
alive
to
the
slights
and
still
more
objectionable
condescension
which
in
her
rôle
of
governess
she
had
not
failed
to
meet
with
her
unworldliness
showed
itself
rather
in
her
perfect
trust
her
childlike
confidence
that
were
there
no
other
difficulty
in
the
way
sir
ralph
would
not
refrain
from
asking
her
to
be
his
wife
because
he
believed
her
to
be
a
governess
and
indeed
though
she
knew
it
not
it
was
only
at
times
that
she
realized
her
present
position
it
was
too
new
to
her
and
she
was
too
conscious
of
its
unreality
for
it
to
influence
save
in
a
passing
way
her
estimate
of
herself
or
others
when
with
sir
ralph
she
always
felt
herself
to
be
equal
in
every
sense
in
every
sense
at
least
in
which
a
true
woman
would
wish
to
feel
herself
the
equal
of
the
man
she
loves
and
in
an
utterly
illogical
way
it
seemed
to
her
almost
as
if
her
knowledge
that
this
was
the
case
her
assurance
that
not
even
from
the
social
point
of
view
could
she
be
regarded
as
other
than
a
fit
wife
for
him
must
somehow
or
other
be
instinctively
recognised
by
ralph
severn
himself
in
all
these
ideas
as
we
have
seen
she
was
partly
right
and
partly
wrong
from
her
own
side
what
troubled
her
most
was
the
consciousness
of
the
deception
she
had
practised
this
indeed
were
it
known
might
give
lady
severn
a
fair
and
reasonable
excuse
for
the
growing
antipathy
towards
her
of
which
marion
had
for
some
time
felt
conscious
while
rightly
attributing
it
to
the
specious
influence
of
miss
vyse
and
far
worse
than
sir
ralph
she
knew
well
was
not
the
sort
of
man
to
like
or
dislike
at
the
bidding
of
another
even
though
that
other
were
his
nearest
might
not
be
the
effect
on
the
young
man
himself
of
the
revelation
of
her
falsehood
for
such
in
deed
if
not
in
actual
word
she
felt
that
it
deserved
to
be
called
would
he
ever
forgive
it
ever
make
allowance
for
the
temptation
which
had
prompted
it
it
was
not
like
an
isolated
act
she
said
to
herself
in
her
sharp
it
was
a
long
series
of
deception
into
which
she
had
been
led
or
rather
allowed
herself
to
fall
all
these
months
she
had
been
living
under
false
colours
his
very
kindness
to
her
even
seemed
to
her
at
times
to
have
the
scorch
of
of
nay
for
aught
she
knew
anything
beyond
this
same
kindness
was
purely
the
work
of
her
imagination
and
the
little
she
was
sure
of
the
gentle
almost
fatherly
care
which
he
had
always
shown
her
not
hers
it
all
but
belonged
to
miss
freer
the
poor
little
governess
who
had
upon
him
the
claim
that
all
weak
and
dependent
beings
have
upon
the
strong
and
prosperous
so
she
tormented
herself
her
mind
revolving
in
a
circle
of
ever
increasing
wretchedness
doubt
and
then
again
in
those
long
dull
afternoons
when
she
sat
by
bedside
or
longer
duller
evenings
when
she
had
nothing
at
all
to
do
but
dream
by
herself
in
the
little
salon
there
would
come
gleams
of
brightness
beautiful
and
sudden
a
glance
round
the
room
lighting
on
some
book
he
had
opened
when
last
there
or
the
terrace
where
they
had
spent
such
happy
hours
or
even
on
the
glass
which
some
few
days
before
had
held
the
flowers
he
had
brought
one
of
these
things
had
power
to
shed
sunshine
through
her
heart
what
did
they
not
recall
words
all
but
lingering
touches
of
her
fluttering
hair
the
ribbons
of
her
dress
or
the
bracelet
that
clasped
her
round
white
and
tones
more
eloquent
than
words
ah
how
many
silly
sweet
trifles
came
crowding
into
her
mind
each
with
its
own
precious
message
of
hope
and
assurance
she
rose
from
her
seat
at
last
it
was
the
evening
of
the
very
day
on
which
ralph
had
met
frank
and
mr
price
she
rose
from
her
seat
and
stood
erect
in
her
maidenly
dignity
will
believe
she
said
to
herself
will
believe
and
trust
him
i
can
not
remember
his
eyes
his
voice
and
not
think
him
true
it
may
be
he
is
not
his
own
master
he
is
perhaps
fettered
in
some
way
i
do
not
and
probably
never
may
know
but
for
all
that
i
believe
he
loves
me
my
love
has
not
been
given
unsought
though
it
may
be
he
hardly
knew
he
was
seeking
it
i
will
no
longer
yield
to
this
horrible
mortification
this
doubt
of
myself
and
of
him
come
what
may
ralph
severn
mid
i
have
loved
each
and
thereupon
marion
found
peace
peace
indeed
of
a
somewhat
hopeless
kind
but
nevertheless
infinitely
better
than
the
miserable
state
of
doubt
and
unrest
which
had
preceded
it
and
as
she
sat
there
alone
and
silent
dreaming
till
even
the
long
light
evening
was
drawing
to
a
close
she
gave
the
reins
to
her
fancy
in
her
endeavour
to
picture
to
herself
the
nature
of
this
barrier
which
she
felt
convinced
stood
between
herself
and
ralph
one
theory
after
another
she
rejected
as
untenable
but
curiously
enough
the
real
obstacle
actual
want
of
means
his
dependence
on
his
mother
never
once
occurred
to
her
she
was
not
after
all
intimately
acquainted
with
the
family
history
of
the
severns
and
naturally
enough
seeing
ralph
the
head
of
a
house
whose
possessions
were
generally
spoken
of
as
considerable
the
idea
of
associating
poverty
with
one
in
his
position
would
have
appeared
to
her
absurd
suddenly
a
new
solution
struck
her
could
it
be
that
he
was
bound
in
honour
though
not
in
affection
of
the
latter
she
was
very
sure
to
his
beautiful
cousin
florence
vyse
the
more
she
thought
of
it
the
better
it
seemed
to
answer
the
riddle
not
much
of
the
altes
gossip
so
far
as
the
severns
were
concerned
had
reached
her
her
position
in
the
family
and
her
evident
dislike
to
hearing
their
affairs
discussed
had
prevented
her
hearing
much
of
the
which
had
been
freely
circulated
about
them
still
now
and
then
hints
had
reached
her
of
an
on
the
subject
a
family
arrangement
of
which
the
principals
were
sir
ralph
and
the
beautiful
florence
her
own
observation
had
long
since
discovered
that
if
such
were
not
the
state
of
things
it
was
from
no
backwardness
on
the
part
of
the
lady
but
hitherto
her
thoughts
had
never
rested
on
the
possibility
of
there
being
any
foundation
in
fact
for
the
rumours
she
had
heard
for
sir
ralph
had
been
at
no
to
hide
his
aversion
for
his
cousin
his
more
than
indifference
his
absolute
dislike
to
her
society
nor
had
he
spoken
of
her
with
any
prejudice
or
exaggeration
which
might
have
been
attributed
to
some
other
motive
he
had
simply
allowed
it
to
be
plainly
seen
that
he
did
not
like
even
while
he
could
not
but
in
a
sense
admire
her
one
expression
of
his
marion
recalled
distinctly
agreeing
with
her
one
day
when
she
happened
to
allude
incidentally
to
miss
great
and
peculiar
beauty
she
had
heard
him
whisper
mutter
rather
to
himself
yes
no
doubt
but
there
are
some
kinds
of
beauty
than
which
i
would
rather
have
positive
all
this
had
long
ago
decided
marion
that
the
reports
which
had
reached
her
on
the
subject
were
mere
foundationless
gossip
never
before
this
evening
had
it
come
home
to
her
girlish
heart
with
all
its
fresh
belief
in
as
the
necessary
precursor
of
marriage
never
before
had
she
realized
that
the
case
in
question
might
be
a
sad
exception
to
her
heart
and
hand
do
not
always
go
ralph
himself
might
be
bound
in
honour
to
marry
the
beautiful
florence
while
his
heart
had
been
given
to
the
simple
trusting
girl
who
long
ago
had
allowed
him
to
steal
away
hers
in
exchange
her
quick
imagination
once
it
had
seized
the
clue
was
at
no
loss
to
follow
out
its
discovery
is
all
plain
to
me
now
thought
marion
its
daylight
and
it
is
all
but
as
she
lay
down
to
sleep
her
last
thought
was
am
content
with
my
share
i
would
rather
have
his
heart
i
have
got
it
and
she
added
almost
fiercely
will
keep
she
had
sat
up
later
than
usual
that
evening
and
the
next
morning
she
was
somewhat
behind
time
in
making
her
appearance
the
clock
struck
the
half
hour
after
eight
as
she
finished
dressing
just
as
she
was
leaving
her
room
she
heard
the
front
door
bell
ring
and
curious
to
see
who
could
be
so
early
a
visitor
she
passed
quickly
through
the
on
to
the
terrace
which
sideways
overlooked
the
entrance
to
the
house
there
to
her
amazement
she
descried
sir
ralph
severn
what
could
he
be
come
about
at
so
unusual
an
hour
the
little
mystery
however
was
soon
explained
a
slight
bustle
in
the
room
within
and
in
another
moment
lofty
and
sybil
laden
with
lovely
fresh
flowers
made
their
appearance
on
the
terrace
sybil
she
exclaimed
in
the
world
have
you
got
these
lovely
flowers
the
market
answered
lotty
they
beautiful
miss
freer
but
they
are
really
more
from
sybil
than
from
me
she
thought
of
them
from
uncle
ralph
lotty
interrupted
sybil
let
me
pay
for
them
they
are
mamma
miss
freer
to
make
the
room
look
pretty
when
she
gets
up
in
the
afternoon
she
be
pleased
sure
she
will
you
dear
children
answered
marion
are
lovely
we
have
never
had
such
pretty
ones
before
and
cissy
is
so
fond
of
flowers
pray
thank
sir
ralph
very
much
for
getting
them
and
let
me
kiss
you
sybil
darling
for
having
thought
of
them
you
too
dear
lotty
how
early
you
must
have
got
up
yes
we
have
been
up
two
hours
we
were
so
afraid
of
being
too
late
to
go
to
the
market
with
uncle
all
these
flowers
are
for
mamma
miss
freer
but
this
one
is
for
yourself
uncle
ralph
said
and
as
sybil
spoke
she
took
out
of
a
corner
of
her
basket
where
it
had
been
carefully
placed
one
perfectly
pure
white
rose
marion
took
it
from
her
and
held
it
carefully
it
not
a
beauty
said
lotty
but
miss
freer
did
not
answer
she
turned
and
went
out
again
on
the
terrace
there
she
stood
for
a
moment
till
ralph
happening
to
look
up
caught
sight
of
her
his
face
flushed
and
a
smile
came
over
it
when
he
saw
what
she
held
in
her
hand
but
he
only
bowed
and
seemed
to
have
no
intention
of
entering
the
house
so
she
went
back
to
the
children
and
thanked
them
again
for
their
pretty
gift
and
advised
them
not
to
keep
their
uncle
waiting
when
they
were
gone
she
at
down
to
her
solitary
breakfast
with
her
heart
full
of
feelings
while
ralph
walked
home
absent
and
preoccupied
and
answering
much
at
random
to
the
incessant
chattering
questions
of
his
merry
little
nieces
it
is
curious
how
sometimes
when
we
have
made
up
our
mind
to
a
certain
course
of
action
the
most
unexpected
outward
occurrences
seem
as
it
were
to
happen
on
purpose
to
confirm
us
in
our
resolution
so
it
seemed
just
now
to
ralph
the
english
letters
arrived
this
morning
as
he
sat
at
breakfast
after
his
early
visit
to
the
market
among
them
to
his
surprise
he
recognized
one
in
the
handwriting
of
his
chief
as
he
called
him
sir
archibald
cunningham
thought
ralph
as
he
opened
it
that
i
should
hear
from
him
just
at
this
crisis
the
last
man
on
earth
to
write
a
private
letter
if
he
can
avoid
its
contents
were
in
themselves
unimportant
enough
merely
requesting
sir
ralph
to
forward
to
him
by
post
one
or
two
additional
notes
on
the
neighbouring
patois
which
when
in
england
he
had
not
thoroughly
revised
the
gist
of
the
letter
so
far
as
ralph
was
concerned
was
contained
in
the
postscript
would
not
have
hurried
you
about
these
notes
wrote
sir
archibald
i
have
decided
to
leave
england
much
sooner
than
i
expected
remaining
some
weeks
in
switzerland
on
my
way
east
i
start
if
possible
next
week
i
am
only
delayed
by
my
wish
to
find
out
whom
i
am
likely
to
get
instead
of
week
thought
ralph
quick
work
i
must
see
him
before
he
leaves
and
that
day
saw
a
letter
written
and
despatched
to
sir
archibald
announcing
intention
of
seeing
him
in
london
with
as
little
delay
as
possible
and
giving
him
some
idea
of
the
nature
of
the
business
he
was
specially
anxious
to
discuss
with
him
lady
severn
was
not
a
little
annoyed
when
she
learnt
her
intention
of
starting
again
for
england
on
the
morrow
was
very
strange
she
said
ralph
could
not
have
finished
all
he
had
to
do
in
town
when
he
was
there
and
she
did
her
best
to
discover
the
reason
of
this
sudden
move
but
she
obtained
little
satisfaction
on
the
subject
from
her
son
the
remembrance
of
the
last
private
interview
he
had
had
with
her
in
which
a
certain
delicate
and
to
him
most
unpalatable
subject
had
for
the
first
time
been
openly
discussed
between
them
did
not
incline
him
to
be
confidential
till
he
was
obliged
shall
be
only
too
ready
to
tell
you
all
about
this
business
of
mine
when
there
is
anything
to
tell
my
dear
mother
he
said
present
i
can
only
assure
you
such
is
not
the
miss
vyse
did
not
mend
matters
by
privately
confiding
to
lady
severn
her
belief
that
sir
ralph
had
taken
such
a
dislike
to
her
that
he
seized
every
occasion
for
absenting
himself
from
the
home
circle
of
which
she
was
at
present
a
member
am
sure
i
know
why
he
dislikes
me
so
dear
aunt
she
said
sweetly
with
tears
in
her
lustrous
eyes
is
only
of
late
i
help
fancying
but
then
she
stopped
my
dear
florence
do
tell
me
i
beseech
you
i
can
not
indeed
understand
my
conduct
strange
and
unaccountable
as
he
often
has
been
his
present
behaviour
surpasses
all
oh
my
dear
child
if
only
john
had
lived
you
would
not
have
been
thus
unappreciated
he
had
such
taste
and
such
amiability
of
character
and
after
his
death
per
little
thing
he
only
saw
with
my
eyes
but
what
is
it
you
fancy
do
not
blame
me
for
it
dear
aunt
but
i
can
not
help
thinking
that
there
has
been
some
outside
influence
at
work
to
turn
sir
ralph
from
indeed
from
you
it
is
only
since
his
intimacy
with
archer
and
her
friend
that
he
has
changed
so
to
me
and
i
am
sure
i
know
why
they
should
dislike
me
but
i
would
rather
go
home
dear
aunt
she
went
on
i
would
rather
go
though
she
was
further
than
ever
from
thinking
of
anything
of
the
sort
stay
here
to
be
the
unhappy
cause
of
coldness
between
my
dearest
kindest
friend
and
her
home
my
love
go
home
indeed
you
shall
not
think
of
such
a
thing
exclaimed
lady
severn
my
dear
florence
shall
not
be
allowed
to
suffer
for
that
foolish
mad
infatuation
he
forgets
i
think
all
that
is
in
my
power
but
you
my
dear
must
not
dream
of
leaving
me
till
you
do
so
for
a
home
of
your
not
so
bad
for
florence
after
all
it
was
the
first
time
she
had
succeeded
in
obtaining
from
lady
severn
a
distinct
invitation
to
take
up
her
quarters
permanently
in
her
household
and
she
took
care
by
her
vehement
expressions
of
gratitude
to
clench
the
proposal
which
in
a
calmer
moment
the
old
lady
might
not
have
been
in
quite
such
a
hurry
to
make
it
was
not
very
cordially
that
lady
severn
bade
adieu
to
her
son
that
evening
as
accompanied
by
miss
vyse
she
drove
off
to
an
elegant
entertainment
given
by
chepstow
in
the
gardens
of
his
pretty
little
villa
a
couple
of
miles
out
of
altes
sir
ralph
was
to
leave
very
early
the
next
morning
and
therefore
thought
it
expedient
to
make
his
farewells
overnight
he
thought
himself
very
fortunate
in
that
his
farewells
not
being
confined
to
the
ladies
of
his
own
household
entertainment
left
him
free
to
spend
the
rest
of
the
evening
as
he
chose
but
it
was
no
easy
task
he
had
set
before
him
far
from
it
for
to
tell
the
truth
he
had
by
no
means
made
up
his
mind
as
to
what
it
consisted
in
he
was
as
determined
as
ever
in
no
way
to
allow
marion
to
commit
herself
to
any
promise
till
he
felt
that
he
had
a
better
right
to
ask
such
from
her
on
the
other
hand
the
thought
of
leaving
altes
even
for
a
few
days
without
some
greater
assurance
than
that
of
frank
communication
of
the
true
state
of
the
young
feelings
towards
him
was
unendurable
still
more
repugnant
to
him
was
the
thought
of
the
strange
and
unfavourable
light
in
which
his
own
conduct
must
appear
to
her
were
no
sort
of
explanation
to
take
place
between
them
the
worst
of
all
he
could
not
bear
to
go
away
haunted
by
the
remembrance
of
her
pale
face
and
anxious
eyes
telling
of
suffering
and
disappointment
of
which
he
was
both
the
object
and
the
cause
he
must
say
something
however
little
that
was
all
that
he
could
make
up
his
mind
to
what
it
should
be
or
how
it
should
be
said
circumstances
must
decide
he
wondered
as
in
the
cool
or
the
evening
he
walked
to
how
he
should
find
them
would
marion
be
alone
her
friend
not
yet
well
enough
to
be
in
the
in
that
case
what
should
he
do
could
he
ask
for
miss
freer
he
had
never
yet
done
so
and
he
dreaded
tongues
even
that
of
the
discreet
and
amiable
thérèse
he
felt
considerably
at
a
loss
and
when
he
got
to
the
top
of
the
rue
thomas
twice
turned
back
and
walked
some
few
yards
in
the
opposite
direction
while
trying
to
decide
on
his
next
step
he
might
have
saved
himself
the
trouble
just
its
he
was
preparing
to
ring
the
bell
the
door
was
marion
herself
she
started
slightly
when
she
saw
him
said
she
thought
it
was
bailey
i
heard
steps
stop
at
the
door
and
i
ran
to
open
quietly
i
wanted
to
see
him
alone
to
ask
how
he
thinks
archer
really
archer
worse
then
asked
sir
ralph
with
interest
oh
no
i
think
she
is
better
almost
well
again
indeed
but
still
i
am
not
satisfied
about
her
somehow
and
bailey
is
one
of
those
people
that
talks
to
invalids
as
if
they
were
babies
i
thought
perhaps
if
i
saw
him
alone
he
would
tell
me
the
all
this
time
they
were
standing
in
the
doorway
marion
indeed
blocking
up
the
entrance
you
not
going
to
ask
me
to
come
in
miss
freer
asked
sir
ralph
marion
looked
uncomfortable
but
could
hardly
help
smiling
as
she
replied
archer
has
gone
to
i
shall
not
have
the
pleasure
of
seeing
her
all
the
same
i
think
you
might
have
the
civility
to
ask
me
to
come
whereupon
marion
drew
hack
laughing
and
allowed
him
to
enter
the
are
expecting
bailey
he
said
he
say
he
would
call
this
evening
at
nine
he
wanted
to
see
how
cissy
was
after
her
drive
this
nine
said
ralph
consulting
his
watch
still
a
quarter
of
an
hour
off
are
you
busy
miss
freer
or
may
i
stay
a
few
minutes
adding
to
himself
mentally
must
take
care
that
old
gossip
bailey
does
not
catch
me
here
a
nice
amount
of
mischief
he
would
make
if
he
went
chattering
to
my
mother
while
no
not
particularly
busy
replied
marion
rather
sadly
it
seemed
to
ralph
my
evenings
have
been
rather
dull
lately
but
i
hope
cissy
will
soon
be
all
right
hope
so
too
said
ralph
and
then
he
sat
still
utterly
at
a
loss
what
more
to
say
and
how
to
say
it
marion
seemed
calm
and
subdued
perfectly
free
from
nervousness
or
embarrassment
but
yet
in
some
subtle
way
he
was
conscious
of
a
change
in
her
he
looked
at
her
as
she
at
there
opposite
him
so
quiet
and
pale
she
seemed
to
his
fancy
in
her
white
thin
dress
the
faint
colourless
evening
light
seeming
rather
to
shadow
than
illumine
her
slight
girlish
figure
a
sort
of
shiver
ran
through
him
she
looked
so
fragile
so
gentle
and
subdued
what
if
this
were
the
beginning
of
the
end
what
if
he
were
thus
to
lose
her
lose
her
before
indeed
he
could
call
her
his
it
was
all
he
could
do
to
control
himself
to
refrain
from
gathering
this
fair
clinging
creature
in
his
arms
and
telling
her
that
there
she
should
be
held
for
ever
but
he
kept
firmly
to
his
resolution
something
of
what
was
in
his
heart
he
would
say
but
not
yet
the
whole
freer
he
began
wanted
particularly
to
see
you
this
evening
for
again
i
am
going
she
looked
up
at
him
gravely
but
hardly
seemed
surprised
she
said
with
a
slight
the
very
slightest
quiver
in
her
you
have
come
to
say
for
long
i
hope
he
answered
am
very
loth
to
go
but
i
think
it
is
my
best
course
in
a
week
or
two
i
hope
to
be
back
again
and
if
i
succeed
in
what
i
am
going
to
try
for
i
shall
you
may
be
sure
make
no
delay
in
finding
my
way
here
again
i
can
not
explain
to
you
miss
i
can
not
explain
to
you
at
present
my
strange
inconsistent
conduct
but
i
could
not
bear
to
go
away
without
asking
you
not
to
think
worse
of
me
than
you
can
trust
me
for
a
little
just
now
i
can
not
defend
myself
but
i
beseech
you
to
think
gently
of
me
if
here
in
spite
of
himself
his
voice
grew
indeed
i
am
not
mistaken
in
thinking
you
are
likely
to
have
me
in
your
thoughts
at
all
if
i
am
mistaken
i
can
only
ask
you
to
forgive
my
presumption
are
not
mistaken
said
marion
gently
but
very
clearly
are
not
mistaken
and
now
i
am
not
ashamed
to
tell
you
so
i
do
not
altogether
understand
you
but
i
do
not
ask
for
any
explanation
till
you
can
give
it
me
and
if
that
time
should
never
come
i
will
still
not
blame
you
and
i
will
not
even
then
feel
ashamed
of
having
told
you
so
i
know
that
in
some
way
you
are
not
your
own
master
not
free
to
act
as
you
wish
but
i
would
not
feel
towards
you
as
i
do
if
i
did
not
believe
you
cared
for
one
thing
more
than
for
thing
asked
ralph
she
said
right
i
you
he
replied
you
for
all
you
have
said
above
all
for
trusting
me
you
are
right
in
what
you
suspect
i
am
indeed
not
free
but
it
will
not
be
my
fault
if
i
do
not
succeed
in
becoming
so
i
may
fail
in
that
case
i
must
not
ask
you
to
remember
me
but
in
any
ease
marion
my
dear
little
friend
thank
you
for
all
you
have
been
to
me
and
above
all
for
not
misjudging
me
he
had
risen
and
come
nearer
her
she
too
stood
up
and
did
not
withdraw
the
hand
he
had
taken
but
suddenly
she
started
back
snatching
it
away
almost
violently
no
she
cried
am
not
as
good
as
you
think
me
i
am
not
worthy
of
you
i
have
deceived
you
in
letting
you
think
oh
what
shall
i
do
must
i
tell
you
please
ask
me
to
tell
you
yet
some
day
it
may
be
different
but
not
just
now
you
would
blame
me
marion
hush
my
dear
child
i
understand
you
we
both
have
mysteries
you
see
but
distress
yourself
so
tell
me
nothing
you
would
rather
not
tell
some
day
as
you
say
when
i
can
explain
all
my
strange
behaviour
to
you
you
shall
then
tell
me
what
you
please
do
you
think
my
poor
darling
that
i
can
not
trust
you
as
you
trust
me
only
tell
me
this
much
it
is
nothing
that
need
come
between
us
two
if
as
i
hope
in
a
week
or
two
from
now
i
can
see
my
way
marion
looked
relieved
but
anxious
know
she
said
slowly
need
not
come
between
us
if
you
still
wished
to
have
me
i
mean
it
would
depend
on
that
and
on
my
father
she
added
he
would
for
once
agree
to
my
wishes
i
have
never
opposed
him
yet
never
in
but
at
that
moment
the
clock
struck
nine
must
go
said
ralph
bailey
will
be
here
i
think
your
secret
obstacle
will
be
insurmountable
from
what
you
say
probably
you
exaggerate
its
importance
but
before
long
i
trust
we
may
be
able
to
talk
over
together
all
our
difficulties
and
anxieties
which
will
be
the
best
way
of
making
an
end
of
them
a
fortnight
at
most
will
see
me
back
again
till
then
we
must
hope
the
best
and
trust
each
other
now
i
must
go
my
darling
you
are
not
angry
with
me
for
calling
you
so
he
held
her
hand
for
a
moment
firmly
in
his
dropped
it
suddenly
and
was
gone
marion
sat
down
again
in
her
corner
still
feeling
the
strong
but
gentle
pressure
on
her
hand
still
hearing
the
deep
earnest
ring
of
his
voice
it
was
all
very
strange
very
strange
and
bewildering
and
anxious
just
yet
she
felt
too
confused
to
recall
all
that
had
passed
only
the
one
strong
impression
remained
in
her
heart
ralph
severn
loved
her
and
she
was
very
happy
what
was
he
thinking
hope
i
have
done
right
i
hope
and
trust
i
have
done
right
i
could
not
have
said
more
nor
less
it
would
never
have
done
to
tell
her
beforehand
sensitive
as
she
is
of
the
sacrifice
as
it
would
be
called
that
i
must
make
to
win
her
no
now
that
i
am
sure
of
her
i
must
have
everything
else
settled
and
done
before
she
hears
of
it
but
then
again
some
difficulty
she
hinted
at
on
her
side
connected
i
have
no
doubt
with
the
family
disgrace
i
suspected
some
time
ago
her
father
she
mentioned
can
he
have
some
marriage
in
view
for
her
i
should
not
wonder
archer
said
more
than
once
that
she
was
not
always
to
remain
a
governess
there
is
something
queer
about
their
affairs
i
am
certain
for
even
archer
inconsiderate
as
she
generally
is
is
reserved
about
them
but
there
can
be
nothing
that
would
affect
my
marion
herself
nothing
now
that
i
am
sure
she
cares
for
me
but
i
wish
i
were
back
again
as
soon
as
possible
on
my
return
i
must
see
her
and
explain
to
her
my
position
clearly
then
she
must
decide
for
herself
if
she
can
venture
to
be
a
poor
wife
a
very
poor
man
by
all
appearances
but
she
has
a
brave
spirit
of
her
own
fortunately
the
quarrel
with
my
mother
was
not
owing
to
her
so
she
need
have
no
feeling
of
responsibility
about
it
if
there
had
been
no
other
woman
in
the
world
i
would
not
have
married
florence
vyse
yes
i
see
what
i
must
do
as
soon
as
i
return
with
the
promise
i
hope
for
i
shall
lay
the
whole
before
marion
and
in
return
hear
from
her
the
fancied
obstacles
on
her
side
then
i
will
speak
to
my
mother
and
give
her
a
last
chance
of
retaining
my
affection
and
respect
but
not
till
i
have
first
had
a
thorough
explanation
with
marion
and
supposing
my
mission
is
unsuccessful
time
enough
if
it
is
so
i
am
tired
of
caution
it
must
and
so
full
of
hope
and
bright
anticipations
he
started
for
england
the
next
morning
chapter
iii
wandering
on
a
foreign
i
will
lay
one
kiss
upon
thy
hand
and
looking
through
the
lights
of
thy
soft
eyes
whisper
the
old
word
that
runs
before
all
detail
and
change
orestes
it
was
now
about
the
middle
of
march
many
of
the
human
swallows
at
altes
had
already
taken
flight
to
more
northern
latitudes
others
were
preparing
for
so
doing
the
season
was
an
unusually
early
one
the
midday
sun
was
already
too
powerful
to
face
without
great
precautions
in
the
way
of
shady
hats
and
parasols
and
people
no
longer
congratulated
themselves
so
triumphantly
as
a
few
weeks
previously
on
being
out
of
dreadful
english
even
a
little
london
rain
would
be
acceptable
thought
marion
as
she
walked
home
one
glaring
morning
from
the
rue
des
lauriers
and
then
her
thoughts
flew
on
to
a
certain
familiar
figure
at
that
very
moment
probably
enough
pacing
the
grey
dreary
pavement
of
the
great
city
itself
hardly
a
week
had
a
yet
elapsed
since
ralph
left
but
already
she
was
for
his
return
her
heart
alternately
dancing
with
sweetest
hopes
and
trembling
with
misgivings
but
she
would
leave
it
all
to
him
who
so
wise
so
brave
so
true
what
lay
within
human
possibility
to
do
he
would
she
felt
sure
set
himself
to
achieve
the
exact
nature
of
the
complications
about
him
the
fetters
he
had
himself
told
her
of
she
did
not
just
now
much
trouble
her
head
about
vaguely
she
imagined
them
to
be
connected
with
florence
vyse
though
what
if
this
were
the
case
could
be
the
special
object
of
a
journey
to
london
she
was
at
a
loss
to
think
but
he
had
judged
it
best
not
at
present
to
tell
her
and
she
was
content
to
wait
for
his
own
be
followed
alas
by
what
she
could
not
bear
to
contemplate
the
confession
of
the
long
deception
she
had
herself
practised
she
had
left
home
this
morning
as
usual
early
before
the
arrival
of
the
letters
which
cissy
was
looking
for
anxiously
the
indian
mail
being
due
when
she
entered
the
little
she
was
surprised
at
not
finding
her
cousin
there
nor
were
there
about
the
room
the
usual
traces
of
recent
presence
hope
cissy
is
not
ill
thought
she
anxiously
as
she
hastened
to
bedroom
the
door
was
shut
but
in
in
voice
reassured
her
on
entering
the
room
however
she
stood
aghast
at
the
sight
before
her
there
was
cissy
on
her
knees
before
a
huge
trunk
two
or
three
others
of
varying
dimensions
standing
with
their
lids
open
in
a
row
while
every
article
of
furniture
in
the
room
bed
tables
chairs
and
floor
itself
were
literally
heaped
with
the
whole
of
the
little
wardrobe
dresses
cloaks
shawls
bonnets
boots
and
whole
of
possessions
seemed
suddenly
to
have
been
seized
with
a
frenzy
of
disorder
while
she
herself
in
their
midst
her
small
person
almost
hidden
by
the
overwhelming
portmanteau
looked
utterly
unable
to
cope
with
the
chaotic
confusion
around
her
the
scene
reminded
marion
of
the
old
fairy
story
of
the
poor
little
princess
shut
up
for
hours
in
a
room
of
tangled
threads
all
of
which
by
the
expiration
of
the
allotted
time
she
was
ordered
under
pain
of
some
tremendous
punishment
to
wind
with
perfect
regularity
in
even
skeins
for
the
use
of
her
tormentor
are
you
about
cissy
ejaculated
her
cousin
you
lost
anything
have
you
quarrelled
with
madame
poulin
and
determined
to
leave
her
house
on
the
spot
laugh
may
said
cissy
beseechingly
looking
up
as
she
spoke
though
the
request
was
unnecessary
as
the
sight
of
her
face
quickly
divested
her
cousin
of
any
risible
inclination
have
had
a
letter
from
george
at
least
part
of
it
is
from
him
the
rest
from
his
doctor
he
could
not
write
much
here
cissy
was
interrupted
by
sobs
and
for
a
moment
or
two
could
not
control
herself
sufficiently
to
go
on
with
her
explanation
is
the
letter
read
it
yourself
she
said
at
last
handing
to
marion
the
precious
document
am
beginning
to
pack
you
see
we
must
leave
this
the
day
after
tomorrow
i
would
have
sent
to
lady
to
tell
you
had
you
been
late
of
marion
read
the
letter
in
silence
it
was
as
archer
had
said
a
joint
production
begun
by
her
husband
and
then
gone
on
with
and
concluded
by
the
medical
man
attending
him
for
he
had
been
very
ill
this
beloved
of
poor
very
ill
indeed
marion
could
discover
through
the
assumedly
cheerful
tone
of
the
letter
but
he
was
better
now
so
much
better
that
finlayson
an
old
friend
or
assured
her
he
wanted
nothing
more
but
her
nursing
and
society
he
had
got
sick
leave
for
six
months
and
by
the
end
of
march
hoped
to
be
able
to
be
moved
to
a
healthy
neighbourhood
not
far
from
simla
where
by
the
autumn
he
had
every
prospect
of
obtaining
the
staff
appointment
he
had
long
been
hoping
for
so
as
far
as
climate
was
concerned
there
was
nothing
to
prevent
at
once
rejoining
him
provided
always
her
own
health
was
sufficiently
which
point
said
finlayson
anxiety
for
her
husband
must
not
allow
her
to
overlook
nor
must
she
omit
to
consult
as
to
this
both
her
physician
at
altes
and
her
former
medical
adviser
in
england
marion
stood
staring
at
the
letter
without
speaking
was
it
selfish
of
her
that
even
at
this
moment
of
warm
commiseration
for
her
cousin
the
effect
this
sudden
move
might
have
on
her
own
prospects
rushed
into
her
mind
she
tried
to
drive
it
back
but
found
it
difficult
to
do
so
marion
said
cissy
peevishly
for
being
in
no
small
terror
of
her
remonstrance
as
to
so
sudden
and
impulsive
a
step
as
the
immediate
return
to
england
she
was
determined
to
take
the
bull
by
the
horns
by
constituting
herself
the
aggrieved
party
marion
have
you
nothing
to
say
you
stand
there
as
if
you
were
asleep
instead
of
helping
me
with
all
that
must
be
done
to
let
us
get
away
by
are
you
really
determined
to
go
at
once
cissy
do
you
think
you
are
fit
for
the
journey
even
to
london
or
cheltenham
rather
i
much
doubt
it
have
you
seen
bailey
dearest
cissy
i
am
so
sorry
for
you
but
i
fear
you
are
not
well
enough
to
rejoin
colonel
archer
just
am
well
enough
to
go
to
india
but
i
am
not
well
enough
to
bear
the
anxiety
of
waiting
for
another
rows
it
would
kill
me
me
simply
repeated
cissy
emphatically
neither
you
nor
anyone
else
who
wants
to
keep
me
alive
will
attempt
to
stop
me
as
for
bailey
he
is
an
old
woman
and
an
old
fool
to
the
bargain
all
the
same
i
have
sent
for
him
and
seen
him
he
says
i
am
as
well
able
to
go
now
as
i
am
likely
to
be
for
the
next
year
or
two
if
ever
and
whether
it
is
so
or
not
marion
i
must
go
what
is
my
health
to
what
would
i
care
for
my
life
without
him
you
know
what
it
is
to
love
anyone
child
as
i
love
my
husband
some
day
you
may
and
then
you
will
understand
but
now
i
must
ask
you
beg
of
you
to
harass
me
by
no
remonstrance
i
have
done
all
i
was
told
i
have
seen
bailey
and
will
also
see
frobisher
at
marion
felt
indeed
that
any
interference
on
her
part
would
be
worse
than
useless
though
a
sad
foreboding
was
at
her
heart
and
the
tears
filled
her
eyes
as
she
looked
at
poor
rapidly
changing
colour
the
too
great
brilliance
of
her
eyes
and
the
nervous
working
of
her
thin
white
hands
charlie
was
all
she
asked
will
go
too
george
wishes
it
and
simla
is
so
healthy
you
have
not
read
the
which
accordingly
marion
did
and
then
proceeded
to
give
way
to
a
most
silly
and
burst
of
tears
silly
young
ladies
will
exclaim
just
so
but
then
i
am
telling
all
about
it
as
it
happened
and
i
must
not
make
my
heroine
any
stronger
or
wiser
than
she
was
poor
little
girl
cissy
should
have
scolded
her
but
she
instead
thereof
she
plumped
herself
down
beside
her
on
the
floor
and
for
a
good
quarter
of
an
hour
they
cried
and
sobbed
in
each
arms
then
they
sat
up
and
wiped
their
eyes
like
sensible
young
women
as
in
the
main
they
were
kissed
each
other
while
they
cissy
and
may
and
set
to
work
to
think
what
they
must
do
first
of
all
there
was
engagement
with
lady
severn
this
fortunately
was
within
a
fortnight
of
expiring
and
in
answer
to
a
note
of
explanation
which
marion
dispatched
came
a
sufficiently
cordial
reply
from
her
grandmother
enclosing
a
cheque
for
the
fifteen
pounds
which
had
been
all
the
little
governess
would
agree
to
accept
for
each
quarter
owing
to
the
end
of
the
engagement
expressing
thanks
for
the
kindness
and
attention
she
had
bestowed
on
her
pupils
and
begging
her
on
no
account
to
distress
herself
at
having
to
leave
altes
before
the
quarter
had
fully
expired
with
this
came
a
note
for
cissy
it
was
couched
in
much
heartier
language
and
the
anxiety
expressed
as
to
colonel
state
of
health
was
evidently
genuine
lady
severn
in
conclusion
said
she
hoped
to
call
to
see
archer
the
following
afternoon
and
that
she
had
forgotten
to
mention
that
her
would
be
disappointed
not
to
say
goodbye
to
miss
freer
in
person
they
would
be
at
home
all
the
next
morning
if
young
could
spare
a
few
minutes
to
come
to
see
them
thoughtless
of
her
to
propose
it
exclaimed
cissy
some
ladies
deserve
to
be
governesses
themselves
for
a
while
to
see
how
they
would
fancy
that
sort
or
thing
as
if
the
children
could
not
come
to
see
you
oh
may
i
am
so
thankful
for
you
to
say
goodbye
for
ever
to
that
odious
miss
you
said
marion
say
if
i
am
or
not
sometimes
i
detest
her
and
then
again
i
feel
very
grateful
to
her
thanks
to
her
i
am
now
out
of
debt
any
way
this
fifteen
pounds
will
come
in
nicely
for
the
nicely
said
cissy
the
same
like
to
make
you
eat
that
of
cheque
marion
did
spare
five
minutes
the
following
morning
and
the
parting
with
lotty
and
sybil
was
really
a
most
touching
affair
there
had
been
a
secret
expedition
the
previous
evening
from
the
rue
des
lauriers
under
the
escort
of
sister
which
resulted
in
the
presentation
to
miss
freer
or
two
original
though
not
strikingly
appropriate
parting
gifts
a
ornament
from
lotty
of
the
china
pottery
rather
the
district
and
from
sybil
a
and
profusely
illustrated
story
book
more
suited
to
her
tender
years
than
to
the
maturer
taste
of
the
young
governess
fairy
stories
dear
miss
freer
said
the
child
trying
her
best
to
keep
back
her
tears
and
bear
the
parting
bravely
fairy
stories
and
beauty
and
the
beast
is
in
i
looked
for
the
picture
and
jeannette
read
me
the
name
belle
et
la
you
like
reading
it
miss
freer
indeed
my
darlings
said
poor
marion
kissing
them
for
the
twentieth
and
last
time
with
a
strange
wistful
questioning
in
her
heart
as
to
whether
she
should
ever
again
kiss
these
sweet
fresh
child
faces
and
if
so
where
and
when
then
she
ran
away
without
looking
back
to
hide
the
fast
dropping
tears
that
do
what
she
would
could
not
she
entirely
repressed
and
carrying
with
her
the
presents
on
which
had
been
expended
all
the
available
resources
of
the
little
girls
poor
little
presents
there
came
a
day
when
he
hid
them
out
of
sight
far
away
in
a
high
cupboard
not
that
she
lived
to
forget
her
little
pupils
but
sad
unendurable
memories
came
to
associated
with
them
in
her
mind
and
all
she
could
do
was
to
try
to
forget
she
hurried
home
to
the
rue
thomas
treading
for
the
last
time
the
now
familiar
streets
hurried
home
to
find
cissy
immersed
and
but
prostrated
by
the
terrible
business
of
packing
and
accounts
paying
as
much
as
possible
to
me
cissy
dear
i
have
said
my
goodbyes
and
am
now
free
to
work
you
have
to
be
ready
for
lady
severn
you
know
the
berwicks
and
others
we
can
not
attempt
you
might
ask
lady
severn
to
explain
to
them
and
any
one
else
the
reason
of
our
sudden
flight
one
thing
cissy
will
you
do
to
oblige
me
give
lady
severn
your
address
at
cheltenham
it
is
possible
there
may
be
some
message
to
send
us
through
her
i
did
not
like
to
ask
the
children
to
write
but
perhaps
they
may
think
of
suppose
any
one
will
help
them
to
do
so
poor
little
things
even
if
they
wish
it
replied
archer
i
can
easily
give
her
the
she
did
so
when
lady
severn
and
miss
vyse
called
to
as
goodbye
lady
severn
took
the
card
on
which
it
was
written
and
after
glancing
at
it
handed
it
to
florence
when
they
reseated
themselves
in
the
carriage
keep
it
florence
dear
she
said
have
all
my
addresses
though
indeed
i
shall
not
forget
it
i
have
a
capital
head
for
west
parade
leamington
yes
west
and
after
a
bustle
crowded
into
a
few
hours
the
little
party
set
off
again
on
their
travels
just
the
three
archer
marion
and
charlie
for
poor
thérèse
had
to
be
left
behind
chepstow
sent
two
carriages
to
convey
them
to
the
place
from
which
the
diligence
started
and
was
there
himself
to
see
them
off
he
was
very
kind
they
all
agreed
but
it
was
sad
this
sudden
hurried
departure
from
the
place
they
had
come
to
know
so
well
hardly
sad
for
cissy
perhaps
her
thoughts
were
far
away
eastward
and
she
only
lived
in
the
hope
of
soon
following
them
thither
but
for
her
young
cousin
ah
it
was
very
trying
just
a
few
short
days
before
would
be
back
again
when
all
she
had
hoped
would
have
been
explained
between
them
she
had
no
hope
of
meeting
him
in
london
in
all
probability
he
would
have
left
before
their
arrival
and
even
if
not
the
chances
of
their
meeting
were
of
the
most
remote
she
did
not
know
his
address
and
he
neither
knew
of
her
coming
nor
should
he
even
hear
it
from
his
mother
would
he
have
the
slightest
notion
where
to
seek
her
no
she
must
trust
that
he
would
write
as
she
felt
satisfied
he
would
be
sure
to
do
without
delay
if
he
had
anything
good
to
tell
in
any
case
indeed
she
thought
considering
the
circumstances
he
would
write
he
was
so
thoughtful
and
considerate
and
must
have
a
fair
notion
of
the
suspense
she
was
enduring
she
did
what
she
could
before
leaving
altes
besides
the
address
given
at
her
request
to
lady
severn
she
left
with
mme
poulin
several
envelopes
similarly
directed
by
herself
to
cheltenham
address
and
gave
their
obliging
landlady
most
particular
injunctions
to
the
forwarding
immediately
of
all
letters
and
notes
of
any
kind
that
might
be
sent
after
their
departure
how
she
wished
she
could
have
left
some
directed
to
her
own
name
and
address
the
going
in
the
first
place
to
cheltenham
would
add
to
the
delay
but
she
dared
not
venture
to
do
more
and
could
only
trust
that
a
happy
ending
might
compensate
for
the
present
trying
suspense
it
was
a
hurried
and
uncomfortable
journey
and
yet
poor
marion
could
hardly
wish
it
over
for
it
was
the
last
she
could
hope
to
see
of
cissy
for
many
a
long
day
to
come
they
arrived
in
london
very
late
in
the
evening
of
a
chilly
rainy
march
day
for
this
one
night
marion
accompanied
her
cousin
to
her
hotel
for
though
she
had
written
from
altes
to
her
father
announcing
their
sudden
return
to
england
she
felt
more
than
doubtful
of
his
having
received
the
letter
as
he
was
much
addicted
to
eccentric
flights
from
home
of
two
or
three
duration
and
on
such
occasions
did
not
think
it
necessary
to
leave
his
address
how
strange
to
be
in
london
again
and
oh
how
dreary
and
ugly
it
looked
how
painfully
national
dread
of
is
felt
by
the
traveller
returning
home
from
the
brightness
and
freshness
across
the
channel
exclaimed
marion
could
i
ever
have
grumbled
at
altes
sunshine
and
heat
i
envy
you
cissy
i
declare
i
wish
i
were
going
to
india
with
wish
indeed
you
were
my
darling
quoth
cissy
whose
tears
in
these
days
were
never
far
to
seek
if
we
are
to
drop
you
on
our
way
to
the
station
may
it
is
truly
time
to
for
plans
were
to
go
straight
on
to
her
at
cheltenham
the
morning
after
their
arrival
in
london
so
their
goodbye
had
to
be
said
in
the
cab
if
walls
had
tongues
as
well
as
their
proverbial
ears
we
should
want
no
other
story
tellers
but
what
of
the
romances
we
might
hear
from
those
wretchedest
of
conveyances
london
cabs
were
they
likewise
endued
with
speech
oh
the
broken
hearts
that
have
been
jogged
along
the
dirty
london
streets
since
the
days
when
the
first
saw
the
light
oh
the
bright
hopes
doomed
to
disappointment
the
vows
made
but
to
be
broken
the
agonies
of
anxiety
the
of
very
utmost
anguish
of
which
these
grumbling
creaking
or
rattling
springing
hansoms
might
tell
for
my
part
i
think
i
should
much
fancy
spending
a
night
alone
in
one
of
l
hose
dilapidated
remains
of
a
vehicle
at
last
as
no
longer
possible
to
use
which
we
now
and
then
discern
in
some
dingy
corner
of
a
cab
proprietors
yard
i
am
quite
sure
i
should
not
spend
the
dark
hours
alone
strange
shadowy
visitors
would
occupy
the
other
seats
and
long
forgotten
scenes
would
be
within
the
small
compass
of
the
four
wooden
walk
no
assuredly
i
should
not
fancy
it
at
all
but
to
return
to
our
special
cab
or
rather
to
its
occupants
will
be
sure
to
write
to
me
cissy
dear
from
cheltenham
and
tell
me
when
you
really
go
said
yes
dear
of
course
i
shall
replied
archer
you
may
she
continued
let
me
know
how
you
find
uncle
vere
and
harry
for
he
will
be
with
you
soon
he
it
is
so
easy
for
him
to
run
up
to
town
now
he
is
at
i
hope
so
answered
marion
somewhat
absently
then
she
added
in
a
lower
voice
while
a
slight
shade
of
colour
came
over
her
face
you
cissy
dear
be
careful
to
send
me
on
at
once
any
letters
that
may
be
forwarded
to
miss
freer
you
cover
to
cheltenham
i
shall
but
do
you
expect
asked
archer
with
some
surprise
replied
marion
rather
confusedly
something
in
her
tone
made
cissy
turn
so
as
to
see
her
better
then
she
took
the
hand
in
hers
and
said
gently
very
gently
dearest
is
there
anything
you
are
anxious
about
once
or
twice
lately
i
have
half
suspected
something
but
you
are
not
like
most
girls
silly
and
not
to
be
trusted
indeed
i
often
fancy
you
are
much
wiser
than
i
and
i
could
not
bear
to
pry
into
your
confidence
but
now
darling
we
shall
not
see
each
other
for
so
no
i
he
gloomy
you
tell
me
if
there
is
anything
any
special
letter
you
are
expecting
tell
you
just
now
cissy
indeed
i
can
hardly
say
there
is
anything
to
tell
when
or
if
there
is
i
will
write
to
you
at
once
i
promise
you
this
dear
if
i
can
help
you
in
any
way
suggested
cissy
rather
timidly
if
you
could
i
would
as
you
to
do
so
sooner
than
any
one
word
more
may
you
go
on
screening
harry
at
the
expense
of
your
happiness
you
know
how
i
mean
dear
you
would
not
allow
this
idea
of
your
being
only
a
governess
to
remain
in
any
mind
so
as
to
cause
injury
to
your
own
prospects
promise
me
this
for
if
not
i
shall
never
forgive
myself
for
having
given
in
to
this
scheme
of
yours
at
be
afraid
cissy
i
have
no
intention
of
keeping
it
up
the
very
first
opportunity
i
have
i
mean
to
tell
the
whole
truth
to
you
know
whom
for
if
i
ever
see
him
again
he
will
have
a
right
to
hear
you
for
telling
me
this
said
cissy
only
wish
he
knew
it
already
in
any
case
marion
however
things
turn
out
you
will
write
and
tell
me
in
any
case
i
promise
you
i
will
replied
the
girl
here
we
are
at
my
home
oh
how
unhomelike
it
looks
cissy
papa
must
be
away
but
that
i
mind
oh
my
dear
my
darling
cissy
if
only
you
were
not
going
so
far
whatever
shall
i
do
without
you
my
kind
sweet
sister
and
all
her
composure
broken
down
poor
marion
clung
to
the
only
near
woman
friend
she
had
ever
known
she
had
not
thought
she
would
feel
this
parting
so
acutely
and
when
at
last
she
had
torn
herself
away
and
stood
watching
the
cab
drive
off
slowly
out
of
sight
round
the
corner
of
the
square
it
seemed
indeed
to
her
that
she
had
parted
for
ever
with
her
dear
sweet
friend
it
was
a
small
comfort
to
remember
that
the
faithful
foster
now
transformed
into
robinson
was
to
meet
poor
little
charlie
and
his
mother
at
the
station
and
not
forsake
them
till
she
saw
them
off
on
their
long
journey
eastward
for
cissy
was
already
half
worn
out
with
fatigue
and
anxiety
and
the
parting
with
marion
had
been
almost
more
than
she
could
stand
poor
loving
little
soul
that
she
was
thankful
i
shall
be
to
hear
of
her
being
safe
with
her
husband
again
my
dear
kind
cissy
but
oh
how
i
shall
miss
her
thought
marion
as
she
entered
her
gloomy
home
with
no
one
to
welcome
her
but
the
startled
servants
whose
faces
however
did
grow
brighter
when
they
saw
who
it
was
which
even
to
my
thinking
was
better
than
no
welcome
at
all
chapter
iv
the
end
of
september
comes
the
herald
of
a
noisy
world
news
from
all
nations
lumbering
at
his
back
messenger
of
grief
perhaps
to
thousands
and
of
joy
to
some
to
him
indifferent
whether
grief
or
joy
the
task
thou
dead
dead
could
from
ways
that
figure
alight
be
lost
and
i
not
know
so
of
that
fresh
voice
the
gay
delight
fade
from
air
and
i
not
know
matthew
arnold
it
was
not
certainly
a
pleasant
change
from
altes
to
london
for
poor
marion
for
a
day
or
two
she
was
perfectly
alone
her
father
as
she
had
expected
absent
and
she
herself
too
anxious
and
dispirited
to
care
to
announce
her
return
to
the
few
friends
with
whom
she
was
on
anything
like
intimate
terms
on
the
third
day
vere
made
his
appearance
marion
was
sitting
alone
late
in
the
afternoon
in
the
same
room
in
which
we
first
saw
her
when
he
returned
she
heard
him
enter
the
house
she
heard
his
step
on
the
stair
and
rose
half
trembling
to
greet
him
oh
how
she
wished
she
could
feel
glad
to
see
him
what
she
had
of
late
gone
through
had
both
softened
and
widened
her
heart
she
was
very
ready
to
love
this
father
of
hers
if
only
he
would
let
her
but
alas
it
was
too
late
in
the
day
for
anything
of
this
kind
he
came
in
a
tall
slightly
bent
grizzled
man
looking
older
considerably
so
than
his
age
and
giving
one
somehow
the
impression
that
he
must
always
have
appeared
so
he
shook
hands
with
his
daughter
in
what
he
intended
for
a
cordial
manner
and
then
in
a
jerky
sort
of
way
kissed
her
forehead
as
if
he
were
half
ashamed
of
what
he
was
doing
still
for
him
this
was
a
good
deal
and
marion
tried
her
best
to
respond
to
it
heartily
back
again
my
dear
he
remarked
by
way
of
greeting
papa
she
replied
arrived
here
on
tuesday
morning
poor
cissy
went
on
to
cheltenham
at
once
to
begin
her
preparations
i
have
been
so
happy
at
altes
dear
papa
so
very
happy
i
shall
always
be
so
grateful
to
you
for
having
allowed
me
to
go
with
cissy
and
now
that
i
have
come
back
i
am
so
anxious
to
do
what
i
can
in
return
for
your
kindness
you
must
let
me
be
of
use
to
you
than
i
have
been
yes
humph
just
so
half
grunted
half
muttered
vere
glad
you
have
enjoyed
yourself
i
wish
i
could
get
a
holiday
myself
i
am
more
knocked
up
than
i
ever
remember
feeling
this
was
wonderfully
communicative
and
gracious
am
so
sorry
i
thought
you
were
not
looking
very
well
remarked
marion
but
her
father
encourage
any
further
expression
of
filial
solicitude
his
head
already
half
hidden
in
a
newspaper
which
he
had
brought
into
the
room
with
him
he
appeared
lost
to
the
world
outside
its
folds
suddenly
he
startled
marion
by
speaking
again
all
this
nonsense
about
cecilia
archer
setting
of
to
india
just
now
he
asked
this
season
utter
madness
kill
herself
before
she
gets
there
i
thought
she
had
more
doctors
have
given
her
leave
replied
marion
believe
they
thought
the
risk
would
be
greater
of
detaining
her
at
home
when
she
is
in
such
anxiety
and
besides
she
is
going
to
simla
which
is
a
very
healthy
fiddlesticks
growled
vere
good
did
anxiety
ever
do
any
one
simla
humbug
to
get
there
she
must
pass
through
the
very
worst
and
unhealthiest
part
of
the
whole
this
season
to
say
as
you
might
know
if
you
would
speak
less
am
very
sorry
began
marion
but
the
head
had
again
retired
behind
the
newspaper
and
she
said
no
more
in
another
moment
it
appeared
again
have
been
a
lot
of
invitations
for
you
i
did
not
think
it
worth
while
to
send
them
to
altes
you
can
look
them
over
and
tell
me
if
there
are
any
you
wish
to
accept
what
gaiety
you
wish
for
you
must
be
content
with
early
this
year
for
lady
barnstaple
is
going
abroad
in
a
few
weeks
to
some
german
baths
and
i
care
about
your
going
out
with
any
one
you
papa
said
marion
really
grateful
for
the
unusual
interest
he
expressed
in
her
concerns
shall
look
over
the
invitations
but
i
think
i
care
very
much
about
going
out
this
year
a
very
few
times
before
lady
barnstaple
leaves
town
will
quite
content
me
i
have
a
letter
from
harry
she
went
on
feeling
unusually
bold
wants
to
know
if
he
may
come
up
from
woolwich
for
next
saturday
and
sunday
to
see
me
it
is
so
long
since
we
have
seen
each
other
she
added
deprecatingly
for
something
in
the
way
the
newspaper
rustled
frightened
away
her
newly
found
audacity
wants
to
know
if
he
may
come
for
next
saturday
and
sunday
does
he
said
vere
very
slowly
distinctly
emphasizing
each
word
of
the
sentence
you
will
perhaps
be
so
good
as
to
tell
him
from
me
that
most
certainly
he
may
not
come
here
for
saturday
sunday
or
any
other
day
fill
i
see
fit
to
send
for
him
idle
young
idiot
that
he
is
i
wonder
he
is
not
ashamed
to
propose
such
a
thing
had
he
worked
as
he
should
have
done
years
ago
he
might
now
have
been
at
the
head
of
the
woolwich
academy
instead
of
being
at
seventeen
obliged
to
cram
at
a
to
obtain
even
a
line
commission
and
now
forsooth
he
thinks
he
is
to
have
it
all
his
own
way
and
run
up
and
down
to
town
whenever
the
fancy
seizes
him
i
tell
you
marion
you
mean
well
i
believe
but
if
there
is
to
be
peace
among
us
you
must
be
careful
what
sort
of
influence
you
exert
over
your
brother
i
give
you
fair
warning
of
this
see
that
you
attend
to
and
so
saying
he
marched
out
of
the
room
newspaper
in
hand
without
giving
his
daughter
time
to
reply
it
was
well
he
did
so
for
the
fast
coming
tears
would
have
choked
her
voice
though
by
no
means
a
woman
of
the
lachrymose
order
had
of
late
somewhat
deserted
her
and
she
had
so
longed
to
see
harry
not
only
this
she
had
come
home
though
anxious
and
depressed
thoroughly
determined
to
fulfil
to
the
best
of
her
power
her
duty
the
hope
that
no
very
long
time
would
elapse
before
she
might
be
taken
to
a
more
congenial
home
naturally
encouraged
her
to
the
better
performance
of
her
present
duties
before
they
should
be
beyond
her
the
things
of
the
past
and
joined
to
this
was
a
half
superstitious
hardly
acknowledged
belief
that
according
to
her
present
earnestness
in
would
be
the
measure
of
her
future
happiness
was
she
more
of
a
heathen
poor
little
soul
for
so
thinking
than
many
in
their
own
opinion
far
wiser
people
doing
good
for
own
sake
is
a
doctrine
not
often
inculcated
even
by
those
who
think
themselves
the
most
and
surely
cries
the
eager
anxious
heart
i
but
bear
this
patiently
and
to
the
best
of
my
poor
power
perform
these
hard
and
uninviting
duties
surely
i
shall
at
last
meet
with
my
reward
the
father
above
not
a
man
that
he
should
lie
and
has
he
not
promised
to
the
patient
doer
of
present
duty
days
and
blessedness
to
such
as
honour
his
commandments
such
is
the
unexpressed
unacknowledged
hope
of
many
an
aching
longing
heart
a
hope
which
perhaps
strengthens
to
do
bravely
and
bear
uncomplainingly
at
times
when
higher
motives
might
be
powerless
vain
hopes
unwarranted
expectations
are
they
nay
not
so
the
are
no
dream
the
no
delusion
though
they
may
not
indeed
consist
of
the
one
thing
craved
for
by
the
anguished
heart
that
one
gift
whatever
it
be
which
at
such
seasons
seems
to
our
dark
and
imperfect
vision
the
only
blessing
worth
having
without
which
existence
itself
were
no
boon
and
now
to
poor
marion
full
as
i
have
said
of
her
ardent
resolutions
her
incentive
to
exertion
the
thought
that
if
she
were
not
a
good
daughter
at
home
she
would
never
deserve
to
be
placed
in
a
happier
sphere
where
duty
become
so
sweet
and
attractive
would
no
longer
be
a
hard
taskmaster
but
a
smiling
full
of
all
these
earnest
thoughts
and
aspirations
it
was
indeed
hard
upon
her
very
hard
to
be
thus
chilled
and
repelled
by
her
father
and
at
first
he
had
seemed
so
kind
so
much
gentler
and
less
reserved
than
usual
there
was
certainly
some
change
in
him
which
she
could
not
understand
he
was
no
longer
so
calm
and
unbending
as
he
had
impulsive
in
both
and
yet
so
much
more
irritable
than
she
had
ever
known
him
what
could
be
the
meaning
of
it
he
looked
ill
too
and
confessed
to
not
feeling
as
well
as
usual
marion
felt
anxious
and
concerned
and
almost
forgave
him
the
harshness
of
that
last
speech
though
her
eyes
filled
with
tears
as
she
recalled
it
how
sorry
ralph
would
be
for
me
if
he
knew
it
she
thought
if
only
i
could
see
him
and
tell
him
all
my
troubles
and
ask
him
to
take
care
of
me
for
always
and
she
longed
for
him
so
intensely
that
had
he
suddenly
entered
the
room
and
stood
beside
her
she
would
not
have
been
surprised
and
had
she
only
known
it
tears
me
even
to
write
all
these
years
since
that
dreary
march
afternoon
and
though
long
since
then
these
hopes
and
sorrows
of
my
poor
have
faded
and
softened
into
the
faint
shadows
of
the
past
all
even
now
i
can
hardly
bear
to
think
of
that
very
moment
ralph
was
in
a
house
on
the
opposite
side
of
that
very
square
closeted
with
sir
archibald
cunningham
while
they
discussed
the
business
which
had
brought
the
younger
man
to
england
and
of
which
the
successful
conclusion
was
sending
him
back
to
altes
the
next
morning
hopeful
and
elated
feeling
strong
enough
to
face
all
the
world
in
general
and
his
mother
in
particular
now
that
no
insurmountable
obstacle
stood
between
him
and
the
only
woman
he
had
ever
loved
but
this
marion
did
not
could
not
know
so
she
stood
by
the
window
in
a
half
dream
of
vague
hope
and
expectation
something
she
felt
sure
was
going
to
happen
a
sensation
often
the
result
of
nerves
or
excited
imagination
but
for
all
that
none
the
less
consolatory
in
its
way
while
it
lasts
what
happened
was
a
ring
at
the
bell
it
was
almost
too
dark
to
distinguish
the
form
of
the
visitor
as
he
ran
up
the
two
or
three
steps
that
separated
the
hall
door
from
the
pavement
in
vain
marion
strained
her
eyes
she
could
perceive
nothing
clearly
so
she
took
to
listening
breathlessly
the
door
was
opened
but
shut
quickly
visitor
then
thought
marion
and
her
heart
sank
but
another
moment
and
it
rose
again
letters
for
you
said
the
servant
entering
but
as
hastily
retreating
in
search
of
a
light
letters
ah
yes
good
news
often
comes
by
the
post
so
what
may
not
these
contain
one
from
harry
a
few
rough
kindly
words
begging
her
not
to
take
it
to
heart
if
her
request
for
his
visit
was
refused
by
her
father
has
been
so
queer
lately
wrote
harry
changeable
and
irritable
i
am
afraid
of
putting
him
out
and
almost
sorry
i
suggested
it
mind
if
he
let
me
come
we
are
sure
to
meet
before
long
it
is
a
comfort
to
know
you
are
near
at
so
much
from
harry
the
other
was
from
cissy
but
it
felt
there
could
there
be
an
enclosure
yes
sure
enough
inside
few
loving
words
of
last
farewell
it
lay
a
foreign
letter
in
an
unfamiliar
hand
addressed
to
miss
freer
care
of
archer
west
parade
cheltenham
she
tore
it
open
what
a
disappointment
a
large
sheet
of
thin
paper
covered
with
the
she
knew
so
well
a
letter
from
poor
little
sybil
in
fact
folded
and
directed
by
the
new
governess
already
installed
in
place
or
her
dear
miss
freer
that
was
all
ralph
folded
the
letters
his
own
to
miss
fryer
he
destroyed
brown
is
very
kind
wrote
sybil
i
cry
for
you
when
i
am
in
bed
uncle
ralph
has
not
come
home
but
i
think
he
will
be
very
sorry
you
have
gone
that
was
all
there
was
however
a
certain
amount
of
satisfaction
in
the
fact
of
the
letter
come
safe
to
hand
it
showed
that
she
need
fear
no
postal
delay
or
miscarriage
owing
to
the
roundabout
manner
in
which
her
letters
must
come
for
cissy
added
in
a
postscript
forward
the
only
letter
for
miss
freer
that
has
come
and
i
am
leaving
with
my
a
very
careful
and
methodical
person
most
particular
directions
to
forward
at
once
to
you
all
letters
that
may
arrive
to
my
care
for
that
same
mysterious
young
marion
would
much
have
liked
at
once
to
reply
to
poor
affectionate
little
sybil
but
as
things
were
she
thought
it
better
not
this
and
more
important
matters
would
all
be
set
straight
never
in
the
latter
case
it
was
better
for
the
child
to
forget
her
in
the
former
a
short
delay
in
thanking
her
little
friend
would
be
immaterial
for
the
next
few
weeks
the
soul
of
day
was
the
how
she
woke
and
rose
early
to
be
ready
to
hear
the
ring
she
came
to
know
so
well
how
she
composed
herself
to
sleep
by
the
thought
of
what
might
be
coming
in
the
morning
but
the
weeks
went
weeks
so
easy
to
write
each
alas
with
its
appalling
list
of
days
and
hours
and
minutes
looking
back
to
the
time
of
her
return
from
altes
six
weeks
later
marion
could
hardly
believe
that
mouths
if
not
years
had
not
passed
since
the
evening
she
parted
with
ralph
her
life
at
this
time
was
strangely
solitary
she
saw
little
of
her
father
though
she
had
forgotten
none
of
her
good
resolutions
and
in
many
hitherto
neglected
ways
endeavoured
to
show
him
her
daughterly
affection
and
anxiety
for
his
comfort
he
was
on
the
whole
kinder
in
manner
to
her
than
had
been
his
wont
but
still
strangely
irritable
and
uncertain
in
temper
the
change
was
remarked
by
others
besides
herself
and
once
or
twice
commented
upon
by
some
of
the
more
intimate
of
friends
and
allies
who
now
and
then
visited
at
his
house
is
wearing
himself
out
miss
vere
said
one
or
these
gentlemen
to
her
and
body
the
amount
of
work
he
has
gone
through
in
the
last
few
years
would
have
killed
most
men
long
ago
he
is
wearing
himself
poor
marion
thought
it
only
too
probable
and
more
than
ever
regretted
the
unnatural
isolation
from
his
children
in
which
her
father
had
chosen
to
live
which
now
utterly
precluded
her
from
remonstrance
or
interference
of
any
kind
as
the
season
advanced
she
went
out
a
little
more
under
the
chaperonage
of
her
lady
barnstaple
but
it
was
weary
it
was
weary
and
unenjoyable
she
had
not
naturally
enough
of
what
are
called
to
throw
off
suffering
even
temporarily
under
excitement
as
many
by
no
means
heartless
women
are
able
to
do
her
indifferent
almost
absent
manner
came
to
be
remarked
by
the
few
who
knew
her
well
enough
to
notice
her
and
more
than
one
desirable
who
had
in
former
days
been
struck
by
the
sweet
brightness
and
gentle
gaiety
was
frightened
away
by
the
indefinable
change
that
had
come
over
her
vere
looks
as
if
she
were
going
into
a
decline
was
murmured
on
more
than
one
occasion
when
her
slender
figure
and
pale
grave
face
were
discerned
among
the
crowd
a
pity
is
it
not
and
she
promised
to
be
so
pretty
last
year
do
you
remember
her
no
it
was
long
before
your
time
of
percy
she
was
the
merivale
percies
you
know
and
such
a
lovely
creature
they
do
say
vere
bullied
her
to
death
i
could
believe
it
of
him
those
very
clever
ambitious
men
my
dear
are
not
the
best
husbands
have
you
heard
that
a
baronetcy
is
spoken
of
for
him
no
ah
then
it
may
be
mere
gossip
and
so
on
not
till
may
did
marion
get
a
glimpse
of
harry
and
then
but
a
hurried
one
vere
graciously
permitted
him
to
come
up
to
town
on
his
birthday
which
fell
in
pleasant
his
visit
was
really
the
first
bright
spot
in
her
life
since
her
return
to
england
how
well
and
happy
he
looked
and
how
sweet
it
was
to
be
thanked
by
his
own
lips
for
what
she
had
done
for
though
she
knew
it
not
at
a
priced
that
had
cost
her
dear
for
she
was
still
as
far
as
ever
from
guessing
the
real
nature
of
the
difficulty
that
ralph
had
alluded
to
still
she
imagined
it
to
be
connected
with
florence
vyse
and
in
this
found
the
only
reasonable
solution
of
his
continued
silence
she
now
began
to
fear
never
likely
to
be
broken
or
explained
a
little
incident
led
her
to
do
at
last
what
she
had
not
hitherto
felt
fit
for
write
to
cissy
a
full
account
of
the
whole
from
beginning
to
end
and
to
ask
her
advice
as
to
the
propriety
of
disclosing
to
sir
ralph
the
secret
of
her
assumed
name
and
position
while
at
altes
a
disclosure
which
were
it
to
be
made
could
be
done
by
no
one
so
well
as
by
cissy
and
which
were
it
once
clearly
explained
to
sir
ralph
would
satisfy
her
even
if
the
result
destroyed
her
last
lingering
hope
that
after
all
some
mistake
through
her
change
of
name
had
occurred
that
in
some
way
the
mysterious
obstacle
in
the
way
of
his
marrying
miss
freer
might
be
removed
by
her
appearing
in
her
true
colours
as
marion
vere
if
indeed
he
could
forgive
the
deception
it
was
a
few
chance
words
overheard
at
a
dinner
party
that
led
to
her
taking
this
step
she
had
accompanied
her
father
to
one
or
the
rare
entertainments
he
honoured
with
his
presence
and
finding
herself
at
dinner
very
neighbour
on
the
right
being
a
discontented
gourmand
terrible
conjunction
a
gourmand
being
barely
endurable
and
he
on
the
left
a
church
curate
a
class
with
whom
she
could
never
unlike
most
young
ladies
succeed
in
as
it
is
gave
them
both
up
in
despair
and
amused
herself
by
listening
to
the
snatches
of
conversation
that
reached
her
ears
suddenly
a
name
caught
her
attention
did
you
say
oh
yes
i
know
whom
you
mean
he
was
out
there
before
at
i
mean
a
peculiar
person
is
he
not
a
great
linguist
or
philologist
i
should
say
so
he
is
going
out
again
you
say
sir
archibald
told
me
just
before
he
left
expect
to
have
my
old
vice
out
again
in
a
few
months
when
cameron
returns
was
what
he
said
i
take
some
interest
in
it
as
my
son
and
his
wife
are
thinking
of
spending
next
winter
out
there
for
her
indeed
was
the
reply
in
the
first
voice
and
then
the
conversation
diverged
to
other
topics
it
was
very
strange
what
could
be
the
meaning
of
it
it
must
be
the
same
they
spoke
of
the
description
suited
exactly
this
did
not
look
like
marrying
florence
vyse
marion
thought
it
over
till
her
brain
was
weary
looked
at
it
first
in
one
light
then
in
another
the
final
result
of
her
cogitations
being
the
letter
to
cissy
alluded
to
above
it
was
now
about
the
middle
of
june
by
the
end
of
the
month
she
was
hoping
to
hear
of
arrival
in
india
by
the
end
of
september
at
latest
she
calculated
she
might
receive
an
answer
to
her
present
letter
this
done
she
felt
more
at
rest
than
had
been
the
case
with
her
for
many
a
day
it
seemed
to
her
she
had
acted
wisely
in
allowing
no
false
dignity
to
stand
between
her
and
the
man
she
loved
and
trusted
so
entirely
and
on
the
other
hand
the
step
she
had
taken
in
no
way
infringed
the
delicate
boundary
of
her
maidenly
reserve
in
after
life
need
cause
her
no
blush
to
look
back
upon
vacation
was
at
hand
and
he
was
looking
forward
with
eager
delight
to
spending
it
in
her
society
marion
resolved
that
he
should
not
be
disappointed
of
his
anticipated
pleasure
end
of
september
she
set
before
herself
as
a
sort
of
goal
till
then
resolving
to
the
utmost
of
her
power
to
set
aside
her
personal
anxieties
and
enjoy
the
present
nor
were
her
endeavours
vain
harry
and
she
had
never
been
happier
together
than
during
these
holidays
and
she
herself
unconsciously
regained
much
of
her
usual
health
and
elasticity
both
of
mind
and
body
a
fortnight
by
their
orders
was
spent
at
brighton
here
one
day
altes
and
its
precious
associations
were
suddenly
brought
to
her
mind
harry
and
she
were
strolling
on
the
sands
when
a
voice
beside
her
made
her
start
it
be
is
it
then
posseeble
that
i
have
the
plaisir
to
look
at
mees
feere
it
could
be
none
other
than
monsieur
de
he
indeed
it
was
as
large
or
rather
as
small
as
life
got
up
in
what
he
considered
a
perfectly
unexceptionable
english
costume
the
details
of
which
can
be
better
imagined
than
described
poor
little
man
he
was
so
inexpressibly
delighted
with
himself
and
every
one
else
that
his
gaiety
was
infectious
marion
greeted
him
cordially
it
is
just
possible
thought
she
through
him
i
may
hear
something
however
little
of
him
who
is
never
really
absent
from
my
but
it
was
not
so
the
little
frenchman
had
left
altes
soon
after
departure
and
since
then
had
been
wandering
to
and
fro
now
at
last
finding
himself
at
the
summit
or
his
desires
a
visitor
in
pays
charmant
his
account
of
his
travels
was
very
amusing
only
he
was
so
dreadfully
polite
about
everything
london
he
had
found
tout
ce
y
a
de
plus
beau
but
vairee
triste
surtout
le
squarr
had
not
he
confessed
quite
come
up
to
his
ideal
of
the
much
vaunted
comfort
anglais
and
the
cab
fares
had
struck
him
as
slightly
exorbitant
not
being
accustomed
in
france
to
pay
something
extra
to
the
driver
over
and
above
the
five
itself
as
he
found
was
always
expected
by
london
cabbies
my
dear
monsieur
broke
in
harry
at
this
point
must
have
been
regularly
done
i
declare
a
national
disgrace
to
treat
strangers
so
de
looked
puzzled
he
exclaimed
do
not
quite
at
all
onderstand
monsieur
say
i
have
been
donne
i
request
tousand
forgives
that
i
am
then
beast
mais
bien
que
monsieur
veut
dire
no
said
harry
bluntly
that
at
all
done
means
cheated
taken
in
you
understand
now
i
meant
that
the
cabbies
had
been
cheating
you
in
other
words
you
and
uncommonly
brown
too
he
added
in
a
lower
voice
said
marion
in
a
tone
of
remonstrance
but
de
was
really
too
irresistible
and
harry
after
all
only
a
schoolboy
they
took
the
little
man
a
walk
harry
worse
confounding
his
confusion
by
offering
to
put
him
in
the
way
of
brighton
exhibiting
to
him
the
beauties
of
this
with
which
kind
attention
he
was
so
charmed
as
to
be
rather
at
a
loss
for
sufficiently
effusive
expressions
in
english
and
obliged
consequently
to
fall
back
upon
his
native
tongue
then
harry
took
upon
himself
to
invite
him
to
dine
with
them
a
proposal
which
marion
could
not
but
second
aghast
though
she
was
at
her
audacity
for
at
no
hour
of
the
day
and
on
no
day
of
the
week
were
they
secure
from
their
swooping
down
upon
them
fortunately
however
de
was
obliged
to
leave
brighton
at
once
and
could
not
therefore
accept
their
invitation
much
to
relief
for
besides
her
fear
of
appearance
she
had
been
every
moment
in
terror
of
the
little
frenchman
coming
out
with
some
allusion
to
her
pupils
at
altes
but
the
severn
family
was
not
mentioned
till
the
last
moment
when
de
observed
casually
that
several
of
their
altes
acquaintances
were
spending
the
summer
in
switzerland
the
berwicks
he
said
were
a
lausanne
and
had
taken
a
maison
de
champaigne
at
vevey
well
that
ends
well
and
marion
was
thankful
when
their
friend
had
bidden
them
an
overflowing
farewell
and
taken
himself
off
in
an
opposite
direction
by
the
middle
of
august
harry
was
off
again
for
what
he
trusted
would
be
his
last
at
the
woolwich
and
marion
returned
to
her
lonely
life
brightened
only
by
the
hope
that
the
end
of
the
following
month
would
bring
her
an
answer
from
cissy
no
letter
from
her
cousin
had
yet
reached
her
but
from
the
elder
archer
at
cheltenham
she
had
heard
of
the
safe
arrival
at
their
destination
these
few
weeks
were
not
so
bad
as
those
immediately
succeeding
her
return
home
to
certain
people
ones
perhaps
in
such
circumstances
the
looking
forward
to
a
distinct
goal
is
a
great
help
but
still
it
was
weary
work
all
sorts
of
torturing
fears
would
now
and
then
rush
into
her
ralph
would
have
left
for
the
east
before
any
communication
from
cissy
could
reach
he
would
never
forgive
her
he
was
already
married
to
miss
vyse
these
and
a
hundred
other
coming
from
time
to
time
came
to
torment
her
above
all
in
the
middle
of
the
night
would
they
crowd
upon
her
deepened
and
magnified
by
the
strange
power
of
the
darkness
and
silence
it
sometimes
struck
her
as
curious
that
she
never
dreamt
of
ralph
for
naturally
she
was
a
great
dreamer
and
since
infancy
had
been
accustomed
to
live
over
again
in
fantasy
the
pleasures
and
sorrows
the
hopes
and
disappointments
of
the
day
the
end
of
september
came
at
last
the
indian
mail
was
in
but
as
yet
no
letters
for
her
still
she
was
not
disheartened
not
improbably
cissy
might
have
enclosed
hers
in
a
budget
to
her
or
even
supposing
the
worst
that
her
cousin
had
been
prevented
writing
at
once
she
must
just
extend
a
little
further
her
laboriously
acquired
patience
and
hope
for
what
the
next
mail
might
bring
she
rose
early
on
the
morning
of
the
and
sat
at
the
dining
room
window
watching
for
the
postman
as
had
come
to
be
a
habit
with
her
he
came
at
last
brown
the
discreet
seemed
to
guess
she
was
eager
to
hear
what
he
had
brought
for
before
she
asked
any
question
he
announced
letters
for
you
for
my
she
thought
she
had
not
expected
any
but
still
in
another
minute
a
second
ring
at
the
front
bell
was
explained
by
with
the
times
which
she
took
up
though
hardly
caring
to
see
it
and
amused
herself
in
the
listless
way
people
often
do
when
perhaps
their
hears
are
bursting
with
anxiety
by
glancing
over
the
advertisement
sheet
no
no
one
that
i
care
about
sure
i
wonder
what
people
do
with
all
these
hosts
of
children
there
are
some
wife
of
a
somebody
notting
hill
and
another
the
better
half
of
a
rev

in
the
midland
counties
who
i
really
do
believe
make
their
appearance
here
at
least
once
a
mouth
yes
i
may
happen
to
see
some
i
know
of
ah
i
declare
well
i
need
not
waste
any
more
pity
on
you

little
thing
i
daresay
be
very
happy
but
how
strange
it
seems
so
soon
alter
well
never
mind
very
so
marion
soliloquised
having
gone
through
the
marriages
she
was
on
the
point
of
throwing
the
paper
aside
when
it
occurred
to
her
to
look
if
among
the
deaths
was
announced
that
of
a
very
old
gentleman
their
next
door
neighbour
whose
funeral
had
taken
place
the
previous
day
a
moment
and
the
paper
fell
from
her
hands
to
be
clutched
at
again
and
glared
at
by
the
stony
unbelieving
eyes
which
one
would
hardly
have
recognised
as
the
sweet
tender
then
a
burst
of
wild
bitter
abandonment
of
grief
very
piteous
to
see
poor
girl
poor
solitary
child
this
was
the
first
time
it
had
come
so
near
her
the
first
time
she
had
felt
that
agonising
wild
cry
of
revolt
against
the
awful
law
of
our
nature
which
at
such
seasons
rends
us
with
despair
god
be
thanked
he
himself
hears
that
terrible
cry
his
poor
children
this
was
what
marion
saw
in
the
death
column
of
the
times
the
of
august
at
landour
north
west
provinces
suddenly
cecilia
may
vere
aged
the
beloved
wife
of
archer
regiment
and
only
daughter
of
the
late
charles
esq
of
wyesham
chapter
orphaned
in
his
life
became
him
like
the
leaving
macbeth
est

de

le

qui

octave
feuillet
vere
breakfasted
alone
that
morning
he
was
surprised
at
his
absence
more
particularly
as
he
was
considerably
later
than
usual
having
had
a
sleepless
night
in
spite
of
himself
he
was
beginning
insensibly
to
feel
pleasure
in
society
of
late
he
had
felt
strangely
weakened
and
unhinged
and
when
obliged
by
utter
weariness
to
rest
from
his
usual
occupations
he
found
it
soothing
and
refreshing
to
watch
his
gentle
little
daughter
she
was
just
the
sort
of
woman
one
could
imagine
at
home
in
a
sick
room
calm
cheerful
and
with
immense
of
the
very
best
which
springs
from
no
worldly
notions
of
policy
or
expediency
but
from
the
habit
of
consideration
for
quick
instinctive
sympathy
which
may
be
cultivated
but
hardly
i
think
acquired
so
as
the
breakfast
was
getting
cold
and
no
marion
appeared
vere
fidgeted
and
fussed
and
ended
by
ringing
the
bell
and
desiring
brown
to
enquire
the
reason
of
miss
absence
the
servant
soon
reappeared
evans
wished
me
to
say
sir
that
miss
vere
is
rather
upset
this
morning
indeed
she
thinks
miss
vere
must
have
had
some
bad
news
and
she
would
be
glad
if
so
be
as
you
could
step
up
to
her
room
sir
as
before
you
go
news
exclaimed
vere
if
there
had
been
any
bad
news
i
should
have
heard
but
his
hand
shook
as
he
hastily
emptied
his
and
without
further
delay
he
hastened
up
to
his
room
it
was
the
first
time
for
years
that
he
had
been
in
it
and
as
he
entered
he
was
struck
by
its
plainness
and
simplicity
it
was
the
same
room
she
had
had
as
a
child
and
her
innocent
girl
life
might
almost
have
been
read
in
a
glance
at
its
arrangements
and
contents
there
were
the
on
the
wall
the
upper
ones
filled
with
the
treasures
she
had
not
liked
to
set
aside
the
lower
ones
with
the
favourites
of
her
later
years
there
were
the
plaster
casts
she
had
saved
her
pence
to
buy
many
years
ago
now
somewhat
yellowed
and
disfigured
by
london
fogs
and
smoke
the
framed
photograph
of
harry
over
the
and
a
little
sketch
of
the
dear
old
cottage
at
brackley
the
only
pictures
on
the
walls
somehow
it
all
came
home
to
the
heart
and
for
almost
the
first
time
a
strange
misgiving
seized
him
had
he
after
all
done
wisely
in
the
life
he
had
marked
out
for
himself
had
he
not
deliberately
put
away
from
him
treasures
near
at
hand
which
now
that
failing
health
of
mind
and
body
was
creeping
upon
him
might
have
been
to
him
the
sweetest
of
to
his
weakness
comfort
in
his
need
nor
were
his
misgivings
merely
from
this
selfish
point
of
view
something
of
fatherly
yearning
towards
his
child
pity
for
her
loneliness
and
admiration
of
the
gentle
uncomplaining
patience
with
which
of
late
especially
she
had
borne
his
coldness
and
irritability
caused
him
to
speak
very
kindly
and
touch
her
very
softly
as
he
stood
beside
the
bed
on
which
in
her
paroxysm
of
grief
she
had
thrown
herself
her
face
buried
in
the
pillows
my
dear
he
said
alarm
me
what
can
be
the
matter
my
poor
child
surely
surely
he
went
on
hurriedly
as
for
the
first
time
a
dreadful
possibility
occurred
to
him
can
be
nothing
wrong
with
harry
she
sat
up
mechanically
pushing
back
from
her
temples
the
hair
usually
so
neat
and
smooth
which
had
fallen
loose
as
she
lay
her
father
caught
her
upraised
hand
and
held
it
gently
in
his
but
she
seemed
hardly
conscious
of
the
unusual
kindness
of
his
manner
not
harry
she
replied
oh
papa
look
here
and
as
she
spoke
with
her
other
hand
she
pointed
to
those
dreadful
four
lines
in
the
newspaper
lying
on
the
pillow
beside
her
is
cissy
my
dear
only
sister
i
ever
own
dear
kind
and
the
sobs
burst
out
again
as
violently
as
at
first
vere
hardly
understanding
what
she
said
stared
at
the
place
she
pointed
out
but
for
a
minute
or
two
could
not
decipher
the
words
when
their
meaning
at
last
broke
upon
him
he
staggered
and
almost
fell
is
very
dreadful
he
said
sad
and
dreadful
so
young
and
bright
and
happy
my
poor
little
cissy
it
is
like
her
mother
over
again
marion
my
dearest
child
you
can
hardly
feel
this
more
than
i
do
you
know
all
it
brings
back
to
and
marion
now
glancing
at
her
father
saw
his
face
pale
with
deep
emotion
while
one
or
two
large
tears
gathered
in
his
eyes
it
was
the
best
thing
to
bring
her
back
to
herself
poor
father
she
thought
i
have
misjudged
you
and
with
a
sudden
loving
impulse
she
threw
her
arms
round
his
neck
and
clung
to
him
as
she
had
hardly
even
in
her
confiding
infancy
ever
clung
to
him
before
nor
was
she
repulsed
in
a
little
while
her
father
spoke
to
her
kindly
and
gently
in
a
way
she
would
hardly
have
believed
it
possible
for
him
to
speak
he
in
general
so
cold
and
satirical
so
unbending
and
severe
he
left
her
in
a
short
time
promising
to
write
at
once
to
cheltenham
for
details
of
this
sad
news
and
volunteering
also
to
send
for
harry
for
a
day
or
two
that
she
might
feel
less
solitary
in
her
grief
this
kindness
soothed
and
calmed
her
and
in
an
hour
or
two
she
crept
down
stairs
and
tried
to
employ
herself
as
usual
but
it
would
not
do
ever
and
anon
it
rushed
upon
her
with
overwhelming
force
the
remembrance
of
those
dreadful
printed
words
the
of
august
cecilia
mary
of
august
that
was
the
time
she
and
harry
were
at
brighton
possibly
the
very
day
they
were
talking
and
laughing
with
de
and
then
another
thought
of
aggravating
misery
occurred
to
her
with
cissy
had
gone
the
last
the
very
last
link
between
herself
and
ralph
ralph
whom
more
than
ever
in
this
her
time
of
sorrow
she
hungered
for
ralph
whom
she
could
not
live
without
only
he
were
here
she
thought
to
sit
beside
me
and
hold
my
hand
even
though
i
knew
he
was
never
to
be
more
to
me
afterwards
oh
if
only
only
he
knew
of
my
bitter
grief
he
would
i
know
find
some
way
to
comfort
me
but
he
will
never
never
know
it
never
hear
of
me
again
for
most
likely
my
poor
cissy
never
got
my
letter
at
all
oh
why
are
things
so
cruel
upon
me
why
may
i
not
be
happy
why
could
not
my
one
only
woman
friend
have
been
left
me
it
is
more
than
i
can
bear
this
losing
ralph
again
for
i
had
been
counting
so
on
cissy
and
the
sad
weary
day
went
by
followed
by
others
as
sad
and
weary
and
marion
thought
she
had
drained
sorrow
to
its
dregs
she
had
only
one
continued
kindness
and
gentleness
she
clung
to
him
wonderfully
poor
child
in
those
days
but
more
was
before
her
that
she
little
thought
of
in
her
absorption
she
did
not
observe
increasing
illness
but
when
harry
me
home
on
the
following
saturday
he
was
much
startled
by
it
and
amazed
too
at
the
strange
unwonted
softness
and
tenderness
almost
of
his
manner
to
both
his
sister
and
himself
though
especially
to
the
former
before
leaving
marion
on
the
monday
the
boy
debated
with
himself
whether
he
should
confide
his
misgivings
to
her
but
he
decided
that
it
was
better
not
to
do
so
is
not
as
if
she
could
do
any
good
thought
he
after
all
i
may
be
exaggerating
the
change
in
my
father
i
think
it
is
as
much
his
unusual
kindness
as
his
looking
ill
that
has
struck
me
so
may
has
trouble
enough
still
it
was
with
a
strange
feeling
of
anxiety
and
impending
sorrow
that
he
shook
hands
with
his
father
and
kissed
his
sister
that
monday
morning
when
he
left
them
to
return
to
his
his
presentiments
were
realized
only
too
correctly
on
the
following
friday
he
was
telegraphed
for
and
arrived
at
home
to
find
his
father
already
dead
and
marion
sitting
by
his
bedside
in
speechless
tearless
sorrow
as
he
was
beginning
to
care
for
is
a
little
she
said
in
a
dull
husky
voice
that
did
not
sound
the
least
like
her
own
harry
i
am
so
lonely
so
miserable
i
have
only
you
and
soon
you
will
be
going
away
except
for
you
i
wish
i
might
it
was
very
pitiful
these
two
solitary
children
clinging
to
each
other
in
their
great
desolation
as
long
ago
they
had
clung
to
each
other
for
comfort
in
their
little
trifling
child
marion
whispered
to
her
brother
been
very
sudden
dreadfully
vere
had
been
presiding
at
a
large
public
meeting
the
day
before
that
or
his
death
and
had
come
home
late
saying
he
felt
tired
i
never
thought
he
was
really
ill
harry
said
marion
had
no
idea
of
it
at
breakfast
yesterday
morning
he
seemed
very
well
he
got
several
letters
and
read
them
while
he
eat
his
there
have
been
anything
in
his
letters
to
startle
or
annoy
him
suggested
harry
i
think
not
i
have
them
all
here
among
them
was
one
from
young
baldwin
you
remember
harry
that
he
would
come
to
see
him
as
he
wished
or
papa
seemed
pleased
at
this
and
gave
me
the
letter
to
read
he
began
to
speak
about
baldwin
and
told
him
he
had
appointed
him
our
guardian
or
trustee
in
his
will
it
surprised
me
a
little
his
talking
this
way
to
me
he
has
generally
been
so
reserved
about
these
sort
of
must
have
known
he
was
very
ill
said
harry
said
something
to
me
about
his
will
last
sunday
he
told
me
that
he
wished
to
give
a
little
more
attention
to
his
private
affairs
than
he
had
found
time
for
for
some
years
past
indeed
marion
i
may
be
mistaken
but
i
have
a
sort
of
idea
that
though
every
one
has
seemed
to
consider
my
father
a
rich
man
he
was
not
really
so
he
has
spent
an
immense
deal
of
money
on
public
matters
one
way
and
another
that
contested
election
two
years
ago
and
lots
of
subscriptions
and
things
always
going
on
always
the
way
with
men
they
neglect
their
own
affairs
to
look
after
everybody
i
hope
i
may
be
mistaken
but
i
have
my
fears
that
we
shall
not
be
rich
by
any
care
said
marion
would
be
just
as
miserable
if
we
had
millions
i
care
for
money
but
i
wish
you
would
not
talk
about
money
harry
it
seems
too
yesterday
think
me
heartless
dear
may
said
the
boy
myself
i
truly
care
i
could
go
to
india
it
was
only
for
you
did
my
father
say
nothing
more
to
you
replied
his
sister
least
only
a
word
or
two
almost
at
the
last
before
he
became
unconscious
he
went
up
to
his
room
after
breakfast
and
about
after
brown
heard
a
heavy
fall
he
ran
upstairs
and
found
him
as
he
told
you
in
a
sort
of
fit
i
understand
what
it
was
exactly
he
lifted
him
on
to
his
bed
and
sent
for
a
doctor
before
telling
me
poor
brown
he
was
very
kind
and
thoughtful
a
little
after
the
doctor
came
papa
grew
slightly
better
and
asked
for
me
i
was
beside
him
he
signed
for
me
to
kiss
him
and
whispered
to
me
have
been
my
dear
little
daughter
it
was
a
great
mistake
but
you
will
forgive
me
poor
harry
then
he
grew
uneasy
and
muttered
something
about
for
baldwin
hoping
it
would
be
all
right
for
them
poor
i
bent
down
and
said
clear
papa
it
will
be
all
he
seemed
pleased
and
smiled
at
me
but
he
did
not
speak
again
to
me
only
i
heard
him
whisper
to
himself
very
very
one
else
heard
prayer
of
the
poor
publican
harry
be
merciful
to
me
a
then
he
lay
quite
still
seeming
not
to
suffer
at
all
i
had
laid
my
head
down
for
a
minute
when
the
doctor
spoke
to
me
then
l
knew
harry
oh
poor
papa
poor
papa
we
did
not
think
we
cared
so
much
for
him
did
we
harry
said
the
boy
that
he
cared
for
there
was
no
exaggeration
about
their
grief
vere
had
not
been
an
affectionate
father
and
his
death
was
far
from
being
to
them
the
overwhelming
utterly
prostrating
blow
that
the
loss
of
a
parent
is
felt
to
be
in
some
happier
families
nevertheless
it
was
more
especially
from
its
suddenness
a
very
terrible
shock
to
marion
in
particular
whose
life
for
several
months
had
been
one
of
constant
suspense
and
disappointment
culminating
in
the
great
grief
of
her
death
and
young
natures
after
all
with
rare
exceptions
are
sweet
and
generous
ready
to
forgive
and
forget
not
backward
to
give
their
love
on
slight
enough
encouragement
baldwin
came
late
on
monday
evening
harry
received
him
but
marion
was
tired
and
begged
not
to
be
asked
to
see
him
or
any
one
till
after
the
funeral
was
over
vere
had
left
directions
that
this
should
take
place
very
quietly
in
consequence
of
which
only
a
few
of
his
most
intimate
friends
were
present
it
was
evident
that
he
had
for
some
time
past
suspected
the
state
of
his
own
health
only
two
days
before
he
had
called
on
his
lawyer
about
some
slight
addition
to
his
will
which
however
there
had
not
been
time
to
execute
and
had
left
with
him
a
letter
of
directions
as
to
the
arrangements
of
his
funeral
in
case
of
his
death
occurring
suddenly
as
he
had
been
warned
might
possibly
be
the
case
so
though
the
papers
were
full
of
the
sudden
death
of
the
great
man
each
vying
with
the
others
as
to
the
extent
and
accuracy
of
their
biographical
notices
the
actual
mourners
were
few
and
with
but
little
of
outward
parade
or
ostentation
the
mortal
remains
of
hartford
vere
were
carried
to
the
grave
ralph
severn
sitting
at
breakfast
that
morning
in
his
villa
at
vevey
observed
casually
that
the
member
for
was
dead
useful
man
he
was
a
very
useful
man
his
party
will
miss
him
exceedingly
there
are
rumours
i
see
that
his
private
affairs
are
in
some
confusion
always
the
case
with
these
public
men
i
hope
however
it
may
not
be
he
a
friend
of
yours
then
asked
florence
dear
no
replied
he
have
seen
him
of
course
and
heard
him
speak
but
i
never
spoke
to
him
i
am
far
too
small
a
person
to
be
hand
in
glove
with
the
leading
politicians
of
the
day
but
i
should
be
sorry
to
think
that
a
man
who
had
spent
his
life
as
he
believed
for
the
good
of
his
country
should
leave
his
family
unprovided
he
left
a
large
family
asked
lady
severn
said
ralph
consulting
the
paper
son
and
a
daughter
i
think
it
said
somewhere
his
wife
died
many
years
ago
by
the
bye
she
was
one
of
those
beautiful
miss
percies
of
merivale
mother
you
remember
merivale
of
course
that
queer
old
place
near
my
uncle
it
is
sold
now
but
the
last
time
i
was
in
brentshire
i
went
to
see
it
the
veres
were
brentshire
people
too
were
they
not
dear
yes
one
of
the
oldest
families
there
said
lady
severn
who
prided
herself
on
her
genealogical
accuracy
and
was
supposed
to
be
particularly
well
up
in
brentshire
family
lore
lord
brackley
the
great
man
of
the
county
being
her
remember
them
well
long
ago
but
the
present
head
of
the
family
this
uncle
or
cousin
i
forget
which
married
a
great
heiress
and
emigrated
to
some
other
indeed
replied
sir
ralph
for
whom
these
details
possessed
no
peculiar
interest
and
whose
thoughts
were
just
then
painfully
engrossed
by
private
troubles
of
his
own
complicated
of
late
in
an
altogether
unexpected
way
indeed
said
he
and
straightway
forgot
all
about
the
death
of
vere
and
fell
to
thinking
of
very
different
matters
to
return
however
to
our
poor
little
marion
on
the
morning
of
the
funeral
she
received
at
last
what
she
had
so
long
been
looking
indian
letter
not
alas
in
the
familiar
hand
that
was
wont
to
cause
her
such
pleasure
for
in
all
the
seven
years
of
her
married
life
in
the
east
archer
had
seldom
allowed
a
mail
to
pass
without
writing
to
her
little
dear
handwriting
she
would
never
never
see
again
this
letter
had
a
deep
black
border
and
the
address
was
written
in
a
firm
large
hand
very
different
from
characteristic
scratch
it
was
from
colonel
archer
some
few
sad
details
it
gave
of
last
illness
and
death
the
first
marion
had
received
for
the
elder
archer
had
been
ill
and
unable
to
reply
to
enquiries
the
suddenness
of
which
had
been
its
most
distressing
feature
for
she
had
suffered
little
poor
cissy
some
blunt
strong
words
of
his
own
agony
at
losing
her
which
told
that
poor
george
heart
was
all
but
broken
and
then
her
last
message
to
marion
when
too
nearly
gone
almost
to
speak
george
had
written
them
down
he
said
at
once
for
fear
of
possible
faint
fluttering
words
of
the
tender
affectionate
heart
dear
may
she
had
said
have
done
what
she
wished
and
i
hope
they
will
be
very
that
was
message
and
a
little
lock
of
the
bright
fair
hair
marion
knew
so
well
cut
off
gently
and
reverently
from
his
dead
head
by
the
husband
she
had
loved
so
devotedly
all
but
how
much
enough
to
turn
the
grey
world
rosy
again
to
bathe
all
around
her
in
golden
light
to
fill
her
heart
with
joy
and
thankfulness
which
she
tried
in
vain
to
banish
by
the
recollection
that
today
her
father
was
to
be
buried
am
i
wicked
am
i
heartless
she
asked
herself
forgive
me
if
i
am
but
i
was
so
broken
down
so
hopeless
and
now
all
seems
so
different
by
now
even
this
very
day
perhaps
ralph
will
know
it
all
will
have
received
letter
explaining
away
all
the
trouble
so
far
at
least
as
i
was
concerned
sooner
even
than
for
cissy
must
have
written
before
her
illness
began
yes
sooner
surely
any
day
i
may
look
for
a
letter
from
him
if
as
i
feel
convinced
some
mistake
or
misapprehension
has
been
at
the
root
of
his
strange
and
in
proportion
to
her
previous
hopelessness
and
despair
was
her
present
sanguine
belief
that
all
would
soon
be
well
in
the
afternoon
of
that
day
when
was
over
as
people
say
the
will
read
and
the
few
guests
departed
harry
ran
upstairs
to
beg
marion
to
come
down
to
see
baldwin
who
was
going
to
remain
with
them
for
a
day
or
two
her
presence
at
the
reading
of
the
will
had
been
suggested
but
not
after
all
considered
advisable
for
as
harry
poor
boy
had
feared
the
will
itself
and
still
more
crooke
the
comments
thereupon
had
revealed
that
the
state
of
the
dead
affairs
was
the
reverse
of
satisfactory
and
it
was
thought
well
that
marion
should
be
spared
the
shock
to
her
feelings
of
such
a
disclosure
in
public
some
hint
of
this
harry
gave
to
his
sister
as
they
went
downstairs
together
he
was
somewhat
disappointed
that
she
did
not
say
again
as
she
had
said
the
other
day
care
about
money
harry
truly
i
all
i
fear
she
does
care
thought
her
brother
baldwin
was
in
the
library
harry
said
and
thither
they
went
when
they
entered
the
room
he
was
standing
with
his
back
to
the
door
looking
out
of
the
window
a
tall
powerful
figure
hands
in
pockets
clad
in
tweed
and
velvet
shooting
coat
for
which
by
his
young
permission
he
had
already
exchanged
the
uncongenial
black
in
which
he
had
performed
his
part
as
second
chief
mourner
in
the
morning
but
he
started
when
voice
reached
him
he
had
not
known
that
the
boy
had
gone
to
fetch
his
sister
have
persuaded
may
to
come
down
to
make
tea
for
us
baldwin
said
harry
geoffrey
baldwin
wheeled
round
suddenly
and
his
handsome
face
flushed
vere
he
exclaimed
almost
before
he
saw
her
too
bad
of
you
to
have
warned
me
i
mean
i
thought
we
were
to
be
alone
miss
vere
you
must
excuse
me
really
i
had
no
business
to
change
my
clothes
but
i
know
i
should
see
you
even
as
he
finished
the
words
he
had
begun
a
curious
expression
came
over
his
face
and
seemed
to
affect
the
tone
of
his
voice
marion
hardly
at
first
understood
it
mind
she
said
quietly
am
sure
clothes
have
nothing
to
do
with
their
baldwin
did
not
reply
he
stood
staring
at
her
regularly
staring
in
a
way
that
in
any
one
else
would
have
been
offensive
and
rude
but
he
did
it
so
simply
so
unconsciously
almost
that
the
only
feeling
it
aroused
in
marion
was
an
extreme
almost
nervous
wish
to
laugh
then
it
flashed
upon
her
know
why
you
look
so
amazed
baldwin
she
exclaimed
remember
where
you
saw
me
before
i
can
tell
you
it
was
at
the
railway
station
nearly
a
year
ago
she
added
with
an
imperceptible
sob
in
her
voice
a
look
of
extreme
satisfaction
overspread
his
face
you
for
reminding
me
i
am
so
very
glad
yes
it
was
just
then
you
had
a
little
boy
with
you
she
replied
charlie
archer
i
was
on
my
way
abroad
with
his
mother
harry
she
turned
to
him
appealingly
it
was
too
fresh
yet
for
her
to
tell
it
herself
but
he
understood
her
and
in
a
few
words
explained
to
baldwin
what
marion
could
not
find
voice
to
tell
the
fair
face
before
her
was
softened
by
a
look
of
almost
womanly
commiseration
though
all
he
said
was
the
commonplace
phrase
am
very
sorry
to
hear
he
was
wonderfully
and
of
a
thoroughly
manly
type
of
beauty
tall
as
i
have
said
but
firm
and
compact
the
features
almost
perfect
of
their
kind
and
the
colouring
unusually
rich
and
mellow
if
such
a
word
can
be
applied
to
a
human
face
the
hair
was
of
that
bright
sunny
hue
on
which
however
in
the
shade
some
light
always
seems
to
linger
the
eyes
unmistakeably
blue
honest
laughing
what
i
have
heard
called
opened
eyes
set
round
by
thick
soft
fringes
curling
like
a
a
pleasant
mouth
too
lips
closed
in
repose
though
usually
open
enough
to
show
the
clear
even
white
teeth
within
but
nothing
in
the
mouth
or
lower
jaw
to
spoil
the
beautiful
whole
as
is
not
unfrequently
the
case
in
such
great
physical
perfection
by
its
confession
of
spiritual
weakness
undue
preponderance
of
the
lower
part
of
our
nature
over
the
higher
no
if
geoffrey
mouth
told
tales
at
all
they
were
of
too
great
sensitiveness
too
quick
a
sympathy
too
impulsive
a
heart
to
be
altogether
well
managed
and
directed
by
the
intellectual
powers
with
which
nature
had
gifted
him
for
although
of
average
ability
and
intelligence
he
was
certainly
not
a
clever
man
in
the
ordinary
sense
of
the
word
illiterate
he
called
himself
but
that
was
far
too
severe
feel
deeply
very
deeply
he
could
and
often
perhaps
on
the
whole
too
often
did
but
as
for
thinking
deeply
it
made
his
head
ache
he
said
and
after
all
what
was
the
good
of
it
he
knew
well
and
thoroughly
all
required
of
him
in
his
daily
life
which
was
that
of
a
gentleman
farmer
and
so
long
as
that
was
the
case
he
for
the
life
of
him
see
what
more
learning
he
wanted
but
honest
as
the
day
brave
as
a
lion
and
tender
as
a
lamb
chivalrous
with
a
chivalry
that
is
fast
going
out
of
fashion
generous
and
unsuspicious
to
a
he
went
to
sleep
over
tennyson
and
preferred
a
ride
across
country
to
the
most
exquisite
music
ever
all
the
world
would
not
be
the
worse
of
a
few
more
like
you
geoffrey
baldwin
then
they
talked
a
little
of
old
days
and
geoffrey
blushed
more
than
marion
when
some
of
their
escapades
were
referred
tumbling
into
the
brook
and
his
fishing
them
out
their
and
hounds
when
the
hare
and
she
perched
on
shoulder
the
terrible
horseman
pursuit
and
another
remembrance
came
to
mind
though
this
he
kept
to
himself
of
a
day
when
in
return
for
some
special
act
of
kindness
little
may
had
clambered
on
to
his
knee
and
kissed
and
bugged
him
right
honestly
while
she
promised
voluntarily
too
that
if
only
would
wait
till
she
was
big
she
would
marry
him
she
would
indeed
really
and
truly
or
truality
which
was
her
childish
mode
of
asseveration
a
little
tomboy
i
must
have
been
said
marion
and
then
she
added
dreamily
wonder
if
i
shall
ever
see
that
brackley
cottage
again
hope
so
said
harry
cheerfully
but
he
looked
uncomfortable
and
glanced
appealingly
at
geoffrey
who
in
turn
frowned
slightly
and
seemed
at
a
loss
so
harry
spoke
dear
he
said
must
go
back
to
woolwich
so
soon
and
baldwin
too
has
little
time
to
spare
that
if
you
mind
i
think
we
had
better
explain
to
you
a
little
how
things
are
it
take
long
we
need
not
go
into
details
with
you
but
you
see
we
shall
not
have
much
time
to
consult
said
marion
shall
not
i
am
quite
ready
to
listen
i
understand
business
matters
much
but
you
mind
she
added
half
appealingly
to
baldwin
know
papa
told
me
he
had
asked
you
to
take
charge
of
things
for
us
i
am
very
glad
it
is
so
much
nicer
than
a
she
spoke
quietly
but
with
a
slight
sinking
at
her
heart
why
she
could
hardly
have
told
was
some
fresh
trouble
before
her
some
new
obstacle
in
her
path
just
as
she
fancied
it
was
going
to
be
made
clear
supposing
she
were
utterly
penniless
what
then
she
might
be
obliged
to
become
a
governess
in
reality
how
might
not
this
affect
her
possible
relations
to
ralph
would
it
be
right
for
her
in
that
case
to
think
of
him
or
rather
to
allow
him
to
think
of
her
all
this
flashed
through
her
mind
in
a
bewildering
perplexing
whirl
she
had
time
to
think
a
little
for
baldwin
appeared
to
hesitate
somewhat
to
begin
his
statement
tell
me
she
said
at
last
mind
how
bad
it
is
i
would
so
much
rather
know
have
we
nothing
at
all
to
live
on
is
that
it
no
may
said
harry
eagerly
and
no
miss
vere
indeed
no
exclaimed
baldwin
but
her
thus
fearing
the
worst
made
it
easier
to
tell
the
whole
of
their
large
property
but
a
comparatively
small
portion
after
all
liabilities
were
cleared
off
remained
to
them
for
many
years
it
was
evident
that
vere
must
have
lived
beyond
his
income
though
he
himself
not
improbably
had
been
unaware
of
the
fact
then
when
this
state
of
things
had
been
suddenly
brought
before
him
how
or
when
no
one
knew
it
appeared
that
by
hasty
speculation
he
had
endeavoured
to
retrieve
himself
in
vain
more
and
yet
more
had
been
sunk
and
still
he
had
persisted
in
more
deeply
involving
himself
till
at
last
all
was
gone
save
some
few
thousands
of
ready
money
originally
intended
as
a
settlement
on
his
wife
but
of
which
the
deed
had
never
been
executed
so
in
all
probability
had
his
life
been
extended
this
would
have
gone
the
way
of
the
rest
and
his
children
might
have
been
left
beggars
see
said
marion
i
am
sure
papa
did
it
for
the
best
say
any
more
about
it
but
just
tell
me
how
much
there
is
left
how
much
we
shall
have
to
live
on
i
tell
you
quite
exactly
said
baldwin
we
decide
what
to
do
with
this
house
the
furniture
there
is
a
long
lease
to
dispose
of
and
the
furniture
i
suppose
is
valuable
but
to
give
you
a
rough
idea
he
went
on
consulting
a
note
book
in
his
hand
should
think
after
all
is
cleared
you
and
harry
will
have
i
only
say
hundred
a
year
between
you
the
ready
money
is
at
present
in
the
mallingford
hank
the
bank
of
which
my
father
used
to
be
the
head
you
know
miss
vere
if
the
other
trustee
a
cousin
of
your
who
is
at
present
abroad
wishes
to
put
it
anywhere
else
i
shall
have
no
objection
though
for
my
own
part
i
think
it
may
as
well
stay
where
it
is
the
old
as
safe
as
can
be
all
my
own
money
is
there
which
shows
what
i
think
of
it
still
i
profess
to
be
much
of
a
man
of
business
and
i
should
like
to
have
framley
opinion
i
am
sadly
afraid
i
shall
make
a
very
poor
trustee
i
like
to
say
to
such
wards
for
i
honestly
believe
you
are
both
much
wiser
than
i
fear
your
poor
father
must
have
credited
me
with
some
of
my
own
as
to
money
matters
and
if
so
the
result
will
prove
he
was
mistaken
i
however
can
only
do
my
best
only
pray
ever
ask
me
anything
i
should
not
consent
to
for
i
could
not
possibly
refuse
he
spoke
lightly
and
as
if
to
both
but
his
eyes
rested
on
marion
she
was
touched
by
his
frankness
and
simplicity
his
kindness
of
voice
and
manner
and
in
all
innocence
and
confidence
she
held
out
her
hand
to
him
saying
warmly
you
baldwin
for
explaining
it
to
me
so
kindly
i
am
quite
sure
i
shall
never
wish
for
another
guardian
any
geoffrey
took
the
little
hand
softly
reverently
almost
in
his
own
great
strong
one
a
deep
flush
spread
over
his
face
for
though
sunburnt
he
was
naturally
so
fair
that
as
a
boy
at
school
his
quickly
changing
colour
had
procured
for
him
many
undesirable
epithets
and
there
came
a
grave
earnest
look
into
his
eyes
which
added
to
their
depth
without
diminishing
their
softness
without
speaking
he
pressed
gently
the
hand
that
lay
in
his
held
it
for
a
moment
as
if
mentally
sealing
a
vow
harry
had
turned
away
before
this
little
scene
occurred
and
all
that
marion
thought
of
it
was
kind
and
brotherly
baldwin
is
were
it
necessary
i
almost
think
i
could
take
him
into
my
chapter
vi
mallingford
and
aunt
tremlett
illum
nostri
passunt
labores
non
si
frigoribus
mediis
hebrumque
libamus
sithoniasque
nives
hiemis
subeamus
omnia
vincit
virgil
what
then
do
you
and
harry
think
i
should
do
where
i
should
rather
say
do
you
think
i
should
go
for
i
am
sure
you
have
thought
of
some
plan
asked
marion
later
is
the
evening
as
they
still
at
together
talking
baldwin
looked
at
harry
and
harry
at
baldwin
this
was
the
part
of
the
whole
they
most
dreaded
telling
her
being
as
are
all
their
sex
sad
cowards
when
there
was
question
breaking
bad
or
disagreeable
news
permanent
arrangement
can
be
made
till
we
hear
from
framley
vere
began
baldwin
but
marion
interrupted
him
need
not
i
assure
you
take
him
into
consideration
with
regard
to
my
movements
said
she
is
one
of
those
old
bachelors
that
think
girls
torments
and
provided
he
is
not
asked
to
look
out
for
a
home
for
me
himself
he
will
trouble
himself
very
little
as
to
what
becomes
of
me
i
daresay
harry
may
find
him
a
sensible
adviser
and
he
may
be
a
good
man
of
business
but
beyond
that
i
am
sure
he
only
plan
that
appears
at
all
feasible
to
harry
and
me
resumed
baldwin
one
which
i
fear
will
be
very
distasteful
to
again
he
stopped
tell
me
what
it
is
urged
marion
baldwin
looked
at
harry
beseechingly
nothing
so
very
dreadful
said
the
boy
really
for
the
present
the
only
thing
to
be
done
only
aunt
tremlett
and
mallingford
he
spoke
lightly
but
in
his
heart
he
dreaded
the
effect
of
his
announcement
but
to
his
amazement
marion
took
it
philosophically
in
the
extreme
thought
it
was
that
she
replied
i
daresay
it
will
do
very
fairly
all
things
considered
mallingford
certainly
is
dull
and
aunt
tremlett
duller
but
i
mind
i
shall
get
on
comfortably
enough
and
i
shall
have
you
harry
in
the
holidays
may
i
not
she
asked
appealing
to
baldwin
assuredly
he
answered
warmly
was
thinking
of
that
and
if
miss
tremlett
objects
to
the
racket
of
a
young
gentleman
in
her
house
harry
can
come
to
me
not
two
miles
from
my
house
to
mallingford
and
i
can
lend
you
a
horse
or
two
if
you
like
he
said
turning
to
harry
would
be
capital
said
the
boy
more
to
my
taste
than
aunt
though
stay
there
part
of
the
time
if
shell
have
me
he
added
quickly
seeing
that
his
sister
looked
rather
disappointed
and
so
future
for
a
time
at
least
was
decided
it
all
came
to
pass
very
soon
so
soon
that
ten
days
later
she
found
herself
under
the
escort
of
evans
and
brown
about
to
set
up
a
joint
establishment
after
of
many
standing
in
the
railway
on
her
way
to
mallingford
hardly
able
to
realize
that
not
yet
a
month
had
passed
since
the
day
when
she
saw
those
sad
four
lines
in
the
for
the
first
time
the
destroying
angel
had
passed
close
by
her
breaking
the
small
circle
of
her
immediate
friends
and
now
already
another
place
was
vacant
it
was
rather
a
long
journey
to
mallingford
a
few
years
ago
when
as
children
marion
and
harry
used
to
spend
the
summer
in
the
brackley
cottage
the
railway
only
went
about
of
the
way
and
the
last
thirty
miles
were
traversed
in
the
coach
now
it
was
different
mallingford
had
a
station
of
its
own
at
which
some
half
dozen
trains
stopped
in
the
day
so
the
whole
of
the
journey
was
performed
on
the
railway
at
which
had
she
been
in
the
mood
to
observe
or
feel
interested
in
outside
things
marion
would
have
murmured
for
long
ago
the
stage
coach
part
of
the
programme
had
been
the
great
delight
in
fine
weather
at
least
when
they
coaxed
their
attendants
to
allow
them
to
mount
up
to
the
top
of
the
vehicle
from
whence
they
had
a
charming
view
of
the
country
in
general
and
of
the
four
dashing
smoking
horses
in
particular
but
marion
was
sad
and
listless
and
so
long
as
she
was
left
at
peace
to
pursue
the
wearying
circle
of
her
own
thoughts
cared
little
for
what
might
be
her
surroundings
she
had
heard
nothing
from
ralph
received
no
sort
of
explanation
of
his
strange
conduct
and
her
hopes
were
sinking
low
by
last
message
she
was
now
perfectly
convinced
that
no
sort
of
mistake
was
at
the
bottom
of
his
incomprehensible
silence
he
must
by
the
last
mail
at
latest
if
not
sooner
have
received
explanation
of
the
whole
from
side
that
he
still
refrained
from
communicating
with
her
must
be
owing
to
one
of
two
causes
either
his
feelings
to
her
were
changed
by
the
knowledge
of
the
deception
she
had
practised
or
he
himself
had
failed
in
the
object
of
his
visit
to
england
and
was
still
fettered
by
the
mysterious
complications
to
which
he
had
alluded
complications
in
no
way
removed
as
she
had
now
and
then
begun
to
fancy
might
prove
to
be
the
case
by
the
fact
of
her
being
the
daughter
of
the
distinguished
politician
hartford
vere
instead
of
marion
freer
the
little
governess
that
my
position
would
have
made
any
difference
to
him
personally
she
always
added
i
know
cared
for
marion
freer
as
i
shall
never
never
be
cared
for
again
but
it
might
have
influenced
his
mother
if
the
obstacle
was
in
any
way
connected
with
latterly
she
had
said
to
herself
somewhat
bitterly
that
so
far
as
his
advantage
was
concerned
there
was
nothing
to
regret
my
father
dead
and
a
mere
pittance
all
my
portion
and
the
very
little
beauty
i
ever
had
fading
already
she
thought
as
she
looked
at
herself
in
her
old
toilet
glass
for
the
last
time
the
morning
she
left
london
she
was
mistaken
however
but
her
beauty
was
not
of
a
kind
to
be
materially
affected
by
such
causes
and
in
this
respect
rose
far
superior
to
the
more
striking
but
merely
physical
loveliness
of
such
women
as
florence
vyse
the
that
looked
out
of
marion
grey
eyes
would
render
them
beautiful
till
old
age
the
delicate
features
and
sensitive
mouth
drew
their
chief
attraction
from
the
truth
of
heart
and
refinement
of
mind
of
their
owner
to
my
mind
she
was
at
all
times
a
beautiful
woman
her
nature
in
spite
of
adverse
circumstances
was
sound
and
healthy
and
in
a
sense
even
strong
for
after
all
it
is
the
strongest
who
suffer
the
most
that
bend
only
where
weaker
ones
would
break
as
geoffrey
baldwin
handed
her
on
to
the
little
platform
at
mallingford
station
whither
he
had
driven
to
meet
her
he
at
least
would
have
agreed
with
me
likely
enough
he
would
have
been
at
a
loss
to
define
his
sensations
with
regard
to
her
he
was
not
a
man
who
troubled
himself
much
with
definitions
of
any
kind
certainly
but
it
is
curious
to
reflect
on
the
peculiar
attraction
this
girl
had
for
him
from
the
first
he
had
seen
plenty
of
far
handsomer
women
he
had
known
some
few
as
sweet
and
good
intellect
he
did
not
care
for
did
not
understand
yet
as
he
looked
at
the
slight
figure
in
its
heavy
mourning
dress
at
the
fair
face
and
sad
gentle
eyes
that
glanced
up
at
him
with
their
indescribable
expression
or
mingled
womanliness
and
childlike
appeal
there
came
over
his
honest
manhood
the
same
yearning
instinct
of
love
and
protection
the
same
wild
longing
to
fold
her
then
and
there
in
his
arms
which
before
now
had
stirred
the
innermost
depths
of
ralph
heart
had
indeed
cost
him
no
slight
struggle
to
resist
i
make
no
secret
of
it
at
all
both
these
men
fell
love
with
her
as
it
is
called
almost
from
the
first
it
was
very
strange
they
were
so
utterly
different
alike
only
in
that
they
were
brave
and
good
and
true
but
as
to
tastes
shades
of
character
habits
in
short
that
goes
to
the
formation
of
individuality
you
might
search
high
and
low
far
and
wide
before
you
could
find
two
men
so
radically
dissimilar
as
the
quiet
studious
sir
ralph
severn
and
the
life
enjoying
farmer
geoffrey
baldwin
marion
felt
glad
that
her
young
guardian
had
come
to
meet
her
and
she
told
him
so
seems
less
desolate
she
said
i
do
not
expect
much
of
a
welcome
from
aunt
which
expectation
for
all
his
wish
to
cheer
her
baldwin
could
not
find
it
in
his
conscience
to
disagree
with
so
in
silence
he
put
her
and
evans
into
the
fly
he
had
stopped
to
order
at
the
arms
on
his
way
through
mallingford
he
himself
following
in
his
to
shake
hands
with
miss
tremlett
he
said
to
himself
though
in
reality
to
make
sure
that
his
charge
should
have
what
little
additional
comfort
and
support
his
presence
might
give
her
on
her
first
arrival
at
the
not
very
cheerful
dwelling
which
for
some
time
to
come
at
least
was
to
be
her
home
there
was
no
mystery
about
miss
tremlett
she
was
simply
a
hypochondriac
who
never
having
been
accustomed
in
youth
to
live
for
any
other
object
than
her
precious
self
had
in
old
age
naturally
enough
increased
in
devotion
to
this
idol
she
was
what
is
called
a
woman
of
high
principles
and
excellent
judgement
meaning
i
suppose
that
when
she
was
young
pretty
and
poor
she
had
refused
to
marry
the
only
man
she
cared
for
because
he
was
a
struggling
curate
and
had
done
her
best
to
secure
a
rich
husband
failing
which
she
had
for
years
to
an
odious
old
woman
her
in
hopes
of
succeeding
to
her
fortune
in
which
strange
to
say
she
had
not
been
disappointed
and
now
that
she
was
old
for
the
fortune
did
not
come
to
her
till
she
was
fifty
she
had
not
been
guilty
of
any
enormity
robbing
a
church
for
instance
in
consequence
of
which
and
her
large
fortune
she
was
in
mallingford
and
at
the
various
always
alluded
to
by
the
rector
in
the
terms
above
mentioned
it
was
a
great
feather
in
her
cap
this
taking
her
orphan
to
live
with
her
many
of
her
acquaintances
in
their
secret
hearts
wondered
at
it
especially
when
it
oozed
out
as
such
things
always
do
that
the
great
vere
had
not
left
his
children
well
provided
for
as
jones
of
the
arms
expressed
it
to
her
crony
miss
green
the
milliner
miss
green
was
better
informed
than
jones
however
a
few
days
later
for
she
had
been
working
at
cross
house
miss
residence
and
had
it
from
thomas
the
housekeeper
that
master
and
miss
vere
had
been
left
one
brass
farthing
between
them
jones
i
do
assure
you
she
said
his
debts
they
do
say
something
to
which
communication
jones
replied
by
an
impressive
miss
tremlett
had
been
influenced
by
various
motives
when
on
hearing
of
her
death
she
had
authorized
geoffrey
baldwin
to
offer
her
house
as
a
temporary
home
for
marion
for
one
thing
in
her
heart
as
in
most
others
there
was
a
soft
spot
and
in
her
way
she
had
loved
and
been
proud
of
hartford
vere
then
again
though
to
some
extent
grasping
and
she
was
not
on
the
whole
ungenerous
or
stingy
there
was
one
thing
she
loved
better
than
money
and
that
was
herself
and
her
own
comfort
and
it
occurred
to
her
that
even
if
marion
should
be
left
very
scantily
provided
for
she
would
cause
but
little
additional
expense
in
her
household
and
would
be
all
the
more
ready
to
repay
her
kindness
by
making
herself
a
useful
and
agreeable
companion
the
effect
on
her
nerves
of
a
cheerful
young
person
about
the
house
would
her
medical
man
informed
her
be
decidedly
beneficial
any
way
it
would
do
no
harm
to
try
she
had
been
rather
disagreeably
well
lately
and
felt
in
want
of
a
little
excitement
and
if
marion
failed
in
all
else
there
was
one
point
on
which
it
was
quite
impossible
she
should
disappoint
her
the
presence
in
her
house
would
at
all
events
give
her
something
new
to
grumble
about
so
much
as
to
aunt
tremlett
as
to
mallingford
itself
there
is
not
very
much
to
say
it
was
in
those
days
at
least
possibly
the
last
few
years
may
have
improved
it
an
intensely
stupid
little
town
dull
with
a
dullness
that
to
those
fortunate
people
who
have
had
no
personal
experience
of
small
provincial
town
life
altogether
baffles
description
and
worse
than
gossiping
and
conceited
with
the
utterly
hopeless
conceit
only
seen
to
perfection
in
the
stupidest
or
people
and
societies
conservative
of
course
to
the
in
more
objectionable
and
undesirable
the
object
of
its
conservatism
the
more
stolidly
tenacious
grew
mallingford
instance
the
long
resistance
to
the
introduction
of
gas
lamps
in
the
streets
and
public
buildings
the
still
prevailing
cobble
stones
in
the
the
stiflingly
high
pews
in
the
peculiarly
hideous
church
and
last
not
least
the
universally
signed
petition
against
that
most
noisy
and
blustering
of
railway
the
only
liberals
in
mallingford
were
its
numerous
young
ladies
who
on
the
subject
of
the
fashions
became
positively
rabid
though
their
admirers
of
the
opposite
sex
were
few
for
the
census
reported
but
one
single
gentleman
to
every
eight
or
ten
equally
marriageable
damsels
there
were
really
few
things
a
mallingford
girl
would
have
hesitated
to
do
for
the
sake
of
being
the
first
to
be
seen
in
the
high
street
with
the
latest
fashion
whatever
it
might
be
bonnets
or
hat
hoots
or
paris
crinoline
there
were
good
gentle
souls
in
mallingford
too
of
course
as
heaven
be
praised
there
are
in
most
places
in
this
wicked
world
but
the
prevailing
spirit
of
the
little
town
the
placid
stupidity
unrelieved
save
by
occasional
snappish
outbursts
of
the
ludicrous
pretension
and
exclusiveness
of
its
reigning
families
the
airs
of
the
daughters
of
the
things
and
many
other
of
a
similar
nature
would
need
a
keener
pen
than
mine
to
do
justice
to
them
very
laughable
very
contemptible
no
doubt
were
it
not
that
from
so
surely
passing
away
is
giving
place
not
merely
to
another
but
to
a
better
state
of
things
it
may
seem
exaggerated
to
speak
so
gravely
of
the
foibles
and
absurdities
of
county
town
society
as
it
existed
in
mallingford
some
few
years
ago
as
possibly
it
still
exists
in
other
yet
more
places
of
the
kind
if
it
appear
so
i
can
only
say
that
to
me
it
comes
naturally
to
speak
seriously
of
things
i
have
myself
felt
if
you
like
but
worse
than
absurdities
for
they
have
sprung
from
deep
rooted
error
and
their
influence
again
has
in
its
turn
been
an
evil
one
besides
which
it
is
necessary
to
a
right
comprehension
of
my
life
and
character
that
the
nature
of
the
social
atmosphere
into
which
at
this
critical
period
of
her
history
she
was
thrown
should
be
to
some
extent
at
least
understood
and
justly
appreciated
over
the
cobble
stones
in
the
fly
from
the
arms
marion
was
rattled
to
her
destination
cross
house
as
it
was
called
its
name
from
its
vicinity
to
the
old
market
place
now
wonderful
to
say
deserted
in
favour
of
a
more
convenient
site
in
the
centre
of
which
though
no
longer
surrounded
by
booths
and
stalls
still
stood
in
respectable
decay
the
pride
of
mallingford
the
venerable
cross
queer
things
that
ancient
monument
must
have
seen
in
its
day
strange
sights
if
all
be
true
that
is
to
be
read
concerning
it
in
the
to
mallingford
and
its
neighbourhood
changes
many
and
marvellous
even
in
this
sturdy
little
stronghold
of
conservatism
of
its
antiquity
there
can
be
no
doubt
for
it
was
already
aged
in
when
by
some
special
good
luck
or
on
the
part
of
the
fanatic
destroyers
it
escaped
the
fate
of
its
fellow
monuments
to
marion
in
her
childhood
it
had
not
been
without
appalling
associations
for
besides
whispers
of
a
heretic
or
two
burnt
to
death
at
its
base
there
was
a
more
ghastly
legend
of
a
modern
sapphira
struck
dead
on
the
spot
by
what
some
good
people
used
to
call
special
dispensation
of
providence
as
an
awful
warning
to
succeeding
generations
nurse
told
her
this
pretty
little
story
one
day
when
the
perfectly
truthful
child
persisted
in
refusing
to
confess
to
a
sin
she
had
not
committed
but
it
had
an
opposite
effect
to
that
anticipated
then
i
say
i
broke
the
jug
nurse
when
i
know
i
did
not
god
would
perhaps
kill
me
like
the
woman
which
way
of
putting
it
was
rather
beyond
the
logical
powers
fortunately
the
real
delinquent
was
afterwards
discovered
and
the
little
girl
came
off
with
flying
colours
as
the
fly
stopped
at
the
door
of
the
cross
house
bright
face
appeared
he
rang
the
bell
and
notwithstanding
the
forbidding
frowns
of
the
prim
crabbed
looking
who
answered
the
summons
stood
his
ground
bravely
and
carried
out
his
intention
of
assisting
at
the
first
meeting
of
aunt
and
niece
they
were
almost
strangers
to
each
other
for
the
years
during
which
they
had
not
met
had
changed
the
girl
from
a
child
to
a
woman
and
had
nearly
effaced
from
her
recollection
the
personal
appearance
of
her
aunt
who
had
done
little
to
attract
of
attach
her
young
relative
to
herself
marion
and
baldwin
were
shown
into
a
room
at
the
back
of
the
house
on
the
first
floor
a
pleasant
bright
room
it
might
have
been
had
its
owner
been
a
pleasant
or
bright
person
for
it
looked
out
on
an
garden
which
too
might
easily
have
been
rendered
pretty
and
attractive
instead
of
formal
and
bare
an
untidy
neglected
garden
is
an
unpleasant
sight
but
hardly
less
so
to
my
mind
is
a
faultlessly
neat
one
if
stiff
ungraceful
and
one
might
quite
as
justly
as
the
other
be
described
as
no
person
who
cares
for
a
garden
as
it
should
be
cared
for
would
be
content
with
doling
out
to
it
the
minimum
of
unlovely
unloving
attention
necessary
to
keeping
it
merely
in
particular
kind
of
lifeless
stunted
order
which
is
one
of
the
ugliest
things
i
know
so
as
might
be
expected
from
the
glance
at
the
garden
on
entering
the
room
was
very
dreary
uninviting
and
colourless
the
dingy
library
in
the
london
house
where
we
first
met
marion
was
charming
in
comparison
for
it
though
dull
and
gloomy
always
looked
warm
and
comfortable
which
was
far
from
being
the
case
with
miss
in
the
literal
sense
it
was
not
cold
for
winter
and
summer
spring
and
autumn
it
was
kept
at
an
equal
temperature
by
all
means
of
tiresome
most
of
ventilators
and
equalising
stoves
pipes
with
hot
air
and
pipes
with
cold
on
which
the
credulous
lady
spent
a
small
fortune
in
the
course
of
each
year
still
it
always
looked
cold
it
was
so
oppressively
rather
so
obtrusively
neutral
if
such
an
expression
be
permissible
that
one
almost
felt
as
if
the
most
glaring
mixture
of
colours
would
be
preferable
i
wonder
by
the
way
whence
has
arisen
the
notion
so
common
to
people
of
very
small
taste
or
no
taste
at
all
that
so
long
as
they
stick
to
greys
and
drabs
and
slate
colour
they
are
perfectly
unimpregnable
however
terribly
they
may
mingle
the
shades
or
which
is
almost
as
bad
distress
more
sensitive
organizations
by
unbroken
monotony
of
dingy
gloom
must
say
i
like
quiet
colours
you
will
hear
said
with
a
smile
by
the
most
hopelessly
commonplace
and
least
educated
of
your
acquaintance
colours
just
as
well
my
dear
madam
might
you
be
proud
of
being
stone
deaf
or
lame
of
one
leg
as
of
your
incapability
of
admiring
one
of
the
most
exquisite
of
our
material
gifts
that
of
colour
a
pity
truly
that
you
and
others
of
your
refined
tastes
had
not
a
hand
in
the
arrangement
of
things
in
general
this
world
for
instance
how
very
much
more
tasteful
and
less
it
would
have
been
had
it
been
left
to
your
unexceptionable
greys
and
drabs
not
that
greys
and
drabs
are
not
good
in
their
place
beautiful
even
as
a
background
to
more
vivid
hues
a
repose
to
the
eye
after
the
luxury
of
greens
and
blues
and
scarlets
which
nature
has
the
bad
taste
to
love
and
cherish
so
fondly
but
only
fancy
a
whole
world
of
greys
and
drabs
oh
intensity
of
blue
sky
oh
fields
of
emerald
green
flowers
of
every
conceivable
perfection
of
colour
from
deepest
richest
crimson
through
golden
gleams
to
faintest
blush
of
rose
oh
beautiful
bright
radiant
things
what
a
dreary
ugly
world
this
would
be
without
you
but
we
being
more
refined
in
our
tastes
some
of
us
prefer
as
we
call
them
rather
i
think
would
i
endure
the
agony
of
sunday
bonnet
before
me
in
church
a
perfect
mass
of
utterly
unassorted
reds
and
greens
and
yellows
but
in
its
way
an
innocent
barbaric
expression
of
delight
untutored
and
spontaneous
in
the
so
profusely
bestowed
rather
i
think
this
than
the
other
extreme
of
cold
presumptuous
scorn
of
this
great
gift
which
what
in
a
dungeon
of
a
like
that
of
the
unlovable
miss
tremlett
at
mallingford
from
which
we
have
wandered
an
inexcusably
long
way
chapter
vii
grey
days
there
was
but
sorry
going
for
the
way
was
very
pilgrims
progress
the
autumn
days
were
already
beginning
to
draw
in
and
it
was
growing
late
in
the
afternoon
when
marion
and
her
guardian
entered
miss
presence
so
the
light
was
dim
and
at
first
it
was
difficult
to
distinguish
the
owner
of
the
sharp
somewhat
querulous
voice
which
greeted
them
from
the
opposite
corner
or
the
room
you
have
got
here
at
last
miss
vere
marion
i
suppose
i
may
still
say
excuse
my
rising
at
this
hour
i
always
am
obliged
to
rest
the
sofa
till
tea
time
how
did
you
get
here
oh
as
she
for
the
first
time
perceived
her
companion
there
geoffrey
baldwin
quite
unnecessary
my
niece
could
perfectly
have
walked
up
from
the
station
and
with
the
last
few
words
the
voice
increased
in
acrimony
instinctively
marion
crept
a
little
closer
to
the
tall
form
beside
her
he
felt
her
shiver
slightly
with
his
great
strong
hand
for
the
little
cold
one
hidden
under
her
cloak
and
gave
it
a
reassuring
pressure
she
took
it
quite
naturally
and
for
a
moment
or
so
allowed
her
hand
to
remain
in
his
grasp
but
she
could
not
brace
herself
up
to
reply
to
her
greeting
geoffrey
did
so
for
her
ignoring
altogether
the
latter
part
of
the
speech
he
replied
cheerfully
we
are
miss
tremlett
miss
vere
i
am
sure
is
glad
to
be
at
her
end
but
it
is
so
dark
i
can
hardly
see
take
care
miss
vere
as
marion
made
a
movement
in
the
direction
of
the
sofa
a
footstool
in
the
way
perhaps
miss
tremlett
will
allow
me
to
lights
never
have
lights
between
my
afternoon
luncheon
and
tea
time
geoffrey
baldwin
i
am
sure
you
might
know
that
by
now
replied
the
old
lady
snappishly
head
would
never
stand
it
however
for
once
in
a
martha
is
that
you
you
certainly
need
not
have
brought
the
lamp
till
i
did
but
martha
deposited
the
lamp
and
quietly
retired
now
marion
could
see
her
aunt
plainly
there
was
not
very
much
to
see
a
withered
face
with
some
remains
of
former
good
looks
but
none
of
the
more
lasting
loveliness
of
sweet
expression
or
the
rare
but
unsurpassed
beauty
of
a
tender
loving
old
age
a
graceful
figure
had
in
her
young
days
been
one
of
miss
attractions
and
this
she
still
imagined
that
she
possessed
in
consequence
of
which
somewhat
mistaken
notion
for
the
former
slightness
was
now
rather
to
be
described
as
scragginess
and
angularity
she
was
fussy
to
a
degree
about
the
make
and
fit
of
her
dresses
a
wrinkle
drove
her
frantic
and
though
her
days
were
principally
spent
on
the
sofa
the
slightest
crease
or
rumple
in
her
attire
altogether
upset
her
equanimity
she
wore
a
light
brown
surmounted
by
a
cap
of
marvellous
construction
so
precise
and
stiff
in
its
appearance
that
till
you
touched
it
you
could
hardly
believe
it
to
consist
of
anything
so
soft
and
ethereal
as
lace
miss
tremlett
had
one
art
in
perfection
altogether
peculiar
to
herself
that
of
lying
on
a
sofa
without
the
slightest
appearance
of
ease
or
repose
she
made
you
feel
somehow
as
if
all
the
time
instead
of
reclining
on
a
couch
she
was
sitting
bolt
upright
on
the
stiffest
of
high
backed
chairs
as
marion
drew
near
her
she
held
out
her
hand
and
permitted
rather
than
invited
her
to
kiss
her
cheek
geoffrey
wished
he
could
have
bitten
her
instead
cloak
is
not
damp
i
hope
she
exclaimed
and
as
marion
was
about
to
express
her
thanks
for
the
unexpected
anxiety
on
her
behalf
she
went
on
it
is
the
least
damp
you
had
better
not
stand
so
near
me
i
am
so
sensitive
to
the
slightest
damp
or
on
which
marion
timidly
suggested
that
perhaps
she
had
better
change
it
at
once
if
miss
tremlett
would
be
so
good
as
tell
her
which
was
to
be
her
room
our
housekeeper
is
with
me
she
added
more
and
more
timidly
as
she
observed
the
expression
of
her
face
only
for
one
night
she
is
going
on
tomorrow
to
visit
her
mother
before
her
mean
to
say
that
old
woman
is
going
to
be
married
exclaimed
miss
tremlett
in
a
less
unpleasant
tone
than
marion
had
yet
heard
is
not
her
mother
replied
the
girl
course
i
never
supposed
you
meant
the
mother
said
she
elder
lady
snappishly
mother
is
eighty
and
paralysed
i
call
evans
herself
an
old
woman
and
a
very
silly
old
woman
too
by
what
you
tell
me
i
really
know
where
she
can
sleep
i
had
no
idea
of
you
bringing
any
one
with
you
you
must
speak
to
martha
she
will
show
you
your
own
room
it
will
be
tea
time
in
an
hour
till
then
i
must
rest
good
evening
baldwin
as
geoffrey
showed
symptoms
of
retiring
should
be
so
much
obliged
to
you
if
you
would
remember
to
shut
the
old
woman
thought
geoffrey
as
he
obeyed
resisting
the
boyish
inclination
to
slam
it
loudly
by
way
of
soothing
miss
nerves
he
had
time
for
a
word
to
marion
whom
he
found
outside
on
the
landing
disconsolately
eyeing
the
staircase
and
apparently
at
a
loss
as
to
her
next
proceedings
he
began
to
speak
to
her
jestingly
he
said
in
ridicule
of
her
fears
he
stopped
suddenly
when
she
turned
towards
him
and
he
saw
that
her
eyes
were
full
of
tears
baldwin
she
exclaimed
passionately
leave
here
i
had
no
idea
my
aunt
was
so
utterly
selfish
and
heartless
not
a
word
about
poor
papa
whom
she
professed
to
care
for
oh
i
stay
in
this
dreadful
and
in
her
distress
she
caught
hold
of
his
arm
with
both
her
hands
it
was
rare
that
marion
so
lost
her
and
therefore
the
more
impressive
geoffrey
was
terribly
grieved
am
so
sorry
so
very
sorry
he
said
you
feel
it
so
painfully
i
would
give
all
i
have
in
the
world
to
spare
you
an
hour
in
this
place
but
truly
miss
vere
there
is
at
present
no
help
for
it
anything
i
can
do
in
the
way
of
cheering
your
stay
here
softening
its
disagreeables
you
have
only
to
ask
me
and
i
shall
be
so
pleased
so
delighted
to
do
and
half
timidly
he
laid
his
hand
on
those
still
grasping
his
arm
his
touch
seemed
to
recall
her
to
herself
she
drew
her
hands
away
gently
and
said
penitently
are
too
good
to
me
baldwin
and
i
am
very
self
and
ungrateful
i
will
try
to
be
sensible
and
make
the
best
of
things
so
long
as
i
stay
shall
not
be
an
hour
longer
than
i
can
prevent
you
may
be
very
sure
said
geoffrey
fervently
you
she
replied
sadly
i
am
afraid
there
is
not
much
in
your
power
dear
baldwin
you
could
not
help
me
in
only
way
then
she
stopped
suddenly
geoffrey
had
not
caught
her
last
words
clearly
had
he
done
so
ten
to
one
she
might
have
been
led
on
to
say
more
and
to
yield
to
the
impulse
which
came
over
her
to
take
her
young
guardian
into
her
confidence
to
trust
him
at
this
time
almost
her
only
friend
with
the
sad
little
story
of
her
life
a
good
impulse
it
was
a
good
and
wise
one
ah
marion
why
did
you
not
yield
to
it
why
m
y
darling
if
not
for
your
own
then
for
the
sake
of
honest
chivalrous
geoffrey
what
might
it
not
have
saved
and
you
and
yet
another
if
only
the
child
had
been
a
little
more
conceited
a
trifle
more
like
other
women
she
would
have
seen
the
dangers
before
her
the
sharpness
of
the
tools
with
which
in
all
innocence
she
was
playing
what
a
strange
thing
it
is
that
of
the
many
times
in
their
lives
in
which
conscientious
people
refrain
from
yielding
to
an
impulse
so
large
a
proportion
would
viewed
in
the
light
of
after
events
have
been
wise
and
expedient
whereas
if
ever
such
persons
do
act
upon
the
inclination
they
are
almost
sure
hereafter
to
repent
it
it
is
everywhere
the
trifles
as
in
important
matters
nothing
but
the
old
rule
of
contrary
which
rule
nevertheless
may
some
day
be
seen
to
contain
more
things
by
a
great
many
than
are
at
present
dreamt
of
in
our
philosophy
so
unfortunately
it
came
to
pass
that
geoffrey
did
not
hear
words
satisfied
so
far
with
seeing
her
calm
and
gentle
as
usual
he
bade
her
good
night
and
left
her
promising
to
look
in
in
the
course
of
a
day
or
two
to
see
how
she
got
on
with
old
cat
as
he
mentally
apostrophised
her
marion
succeeded
in
finding
martha
whom
she
was
glad
to
discover
much
more
hospitably
inclined
than
her
mistress
so
evans
was
comfortably
entertained
for
the
one
night
she
spent
at
the
cross
house
and
i
doubt
not
spent
a
much
more
agreeable
evening
below
stairs
than
did
marion
in
the
drab
with
her
aunt
it
really
was
terribly
hard
work
miss
tremlett
evidently
expected
to
be
entertained
a
state
of
mind
always
liable
to
exert
a
peculiarly
depressing
influence
on
the
second
member
of
a
even
when
there
are
no
saddening
or
dulling
thoughts
and
anxieties
already
at
work
on
heart
and
brain
for
the
life
of
her
marion
could
not
rouse
herself
to
make
small
talk
for
the
tiresome
old
lady
nor
could
she
bring
herself
to
express
the
profound
interest
evidently
expected
of
her
in
the
painfully
minute
account
of
all
her
maladies
with
which
in
the
course
of
the
evening
she
was
favoured
at
last
miss
tremlett
lost
patience
and
waxed
very
cross
indeed
you
always
so
stupid
and
sulky
marion
she
inquired
so
the
sooner
you
make
some
other
arrangement
for
yourself
the
better
i
am
not
strong
enough
to
support
the
depressing
effect
of
a
companion
in
low
spirits
nor
can
i
understand
why
you
should
look
so
gloomy
it
is
not
as
if
your
poor
father
had
been
so
much
attached
to
you
or
you
to
him
when
he
was
alive
in
that
case
it
would
be
very
different
indeed
but
all
the
world
knows
he
cared
very
little
for
his
children
though
all
things
considered
i
blame
do
you
mean
aunt
tremlett
said
marion
fiercely
almost
for
she
felt
roused
to
sudden
passion
do
you
mean
by
speaking
so
of
my
dear
father
he
did
love
us
more
than
anybody
knows
and
no
one
has
any
right
to
say
he
did
pity
he
did
not
leave
you
some
more
substantial
proof
of
his
affection
said
miss
tremlett
sneeringly
am
not
blaming
him
however
considering
all
as
i
said
it
is
no
wonder
he
took
but
little
interest
in
do
you
mean
by
that
repeated
marion
in
the
same
fierce
tone
miss
tremlett
rather
enjoyed
her
excitement
she
had
roused
her
at
last
all
what
i
am
not
a
child
now
aunt
tremlett
and
i
will
allow
no
one
not
even
you
to
say
or
infer
anything
disrespectful
to
the
memory
of
either
of
my
not
indeed
very
pretty
language
for
a
young
lady
upon
my
word
i
little
knew
what
i
was
about
when
i
invited
you
to
my
house
marion
vere
though
for
all
your
grand
heroics
i
see
you
have
some
notion
of
what
i
refer
to
of
your
parents
you
said
so
then
you
do
allow
it
is
possible
there
might
be
something
to
be
said
against
one
of
them
after
all
on
the
whole
i
think
with
your
permission
or
course
miss
vere
after
what
i
have
seen
of
your
very
amiable
tempo
it
will
be
as
well
to
drop
the
subject
in
plain
words
i
will
not
tell
you
what
i
mean
and
you
will
i
oblige
me
by
leaving
me
for
the
night
and
retiring
to
your
own
room
you
have
upset
me
quite
enough
for
one
evening
it
will
be
days
before
i
recover
from
the
nervous
prostration
always
brought
on
by
excitement
go
and
if
you
wish
to
remain
my
guest
learn
to
behave
like
a
reasonable
being
instead
of
making
such
an
exhibition
of
temper
without
any
provocation
miss
tremlett
always
took
the
injured
innocent
tone
when
she
had
succeeded
in
goading
any
one
else
to
fury
without
a
word
marion
left
the
room
her
only
lasted
till
she
was
safely
ensconced
in
her
own
little
bedroom
and
then
poor
child
after
her
usual
fashion
when
in
sore
distress
she
threw
herself
on
the
bed
and
hid
her
face
on
the
pillows
sobbing
with
excitement
and
weeping
the
hot
quick
rushing
tears
that
came
more
from
anger
than
grief
she
felt
very
much
ashamed
of
herself
this
was
indeed
a
sad
beginning
of
her
mallingford
experiences
how
foolish
she
had
been
to
take
fire
at
the
old
sneers
she
knew
of
old
that
there
had
been
bitter
feud
between
her
silly
pretty
young
mother
and
her
family
and
it
was
worse
than
foolish
to
rake
up
these
old
sores
now
when
the
two
principals
in
the
melancholy
story
of
mistake
and
disappointment
were
laid
to
rest
passed
away
into
the
silent
land
where
to
us
at
least
it
is
not
given
to
judge
them
how
much
better
to
let
the
whole
fade
gently
out
of
mind
her
aunt
was
old
and
old
age
should
be
sacred
she
had
no
right
to
resent
her
crabbedness
of
temper
her
her
ungenial
asperity
and
small
snappishness
a
loveless
life
with
few
exceptions
had
been
miss
only
knows
thought
poor
marion
in
similar
circumstances
my
nature
would
prove
any
more
amiable
certainly
i
am
not
at
present
going
the
way
to
make
it
and
with
a
sore
heart
sore
but
gentle
and
humble
the
orphan
fell
asleep
in
the
strange
unloving
home
which
was
the
only
shelter
at
present
open
to
her
morning
somehow
made
things
look
brighter
for
one
thing
there
was
the
tantalising
to
watch
for
marion
not
having
yet
given
up
hopes
of
bringing
the
explanation
of
mysterious
silence
the
whole
affair
changed
its
aspect
to
her
constantly
according
to
the
mood
she
was
in
she
had
taken
good
care
that
there
should
be
no
miscarriage
of
letters
owing
to
her
change
of
residence
and
so
here
at
mallingford
as
in
london
the
arrival
of
the
letters
became
the
great
interest
of
her
day
truly
there
was
little
else
to
distract
or
occupy
her
she
determined
however
from
this
first
morning
to
profit
by
her
disagreeable
experience
of
the
preceding
evening
and
at
all
costs
avoid
any
sort
of
with
her
aunt
miss
tremlett
at
the
bottom
of
her
heart
was
not
a
little
disappointed
when
on
her
making
her
appearance
for
the
day
in
the
about
noon
her
niece
instead
of
receiving
her
with
sulky
silence
or
indignant
remonstrance
greeted
her
with
a
few
gentle
words
of
apology
for
her
want
of
the
previous
night
and
offers
of
her
ready
services
in
any
way
the
old
lady
might
wish
to
make
her
useful
you
like
me
to
read
aloud
sometimes
aunt
said
she
think
i
can
do
so
pleasantly
or
is
there
any
work
i
can
do
for
you
am
glad
marion
to
see
that
you
have
come
back
to
your
senses
this
morning
was
all
the
thanks
she
got
but
she
did
not
care
all
she
asked
was
peace
and
quiet
in
which
to
muse
over
her
own
secret
hopes
and
fears
to
perplex
herself
endlessly
with
vain
guesses
to
what
was
beyond
her
power
to
fathom
and
for
some
little
time
she
felt
almost
contented
the
perfect
monotony
of
her
life
did
not
pall
upon
her
just
at
first
it
seemed
rather
a
sort
of
rest
to
her
after
the
violent
excitement
through
which
she
had
lately
passed
but
it
was
not
a
healthy
state
of
things
her
days
were
very
like
each
other
the
morning
hours
were
the
pleasantest
for
miss
tremlett
always
breakfasted
in
her
bedroom
and
till
noon
marion
was
her
own
mistress
after
that
her
aunt
expected
her
to
be
in
attendance
upon
her
till
the
hour
of
her
after
noon
siesta
which
came
to
be
the
favourite
time
for
a
stroll
even
in
the
dull
autumn
days
she
felt
it
a
relief
to
get
out
into
the
open
air
by
herself
and
ramble
along
the
country
roads
leading
out
of
of
what
of
time
last
how
much
is
told
by
those
few
commonplace
words
now
and
then
her
aunt
had
visitors
very
uninteresting
people
they
seemed
to
marion
mostly
elderly
still
and
formal
of
her
own
standing
not
many
of
the
younger
denizens
of
the
little
town
found
their
way
to
the
cross
house
had
they
done
so
i
question
if
they
would
have
been
much
to
my
taste
her
deep
mourning
of
course
put
her
partaking
in
any
mallingford
festivities
quite
out
of
the
question
at
present
they
were
not
of
an
attractive
kind
and
even
had
she
been
in
perfect
health
and
spirits
she
would
have
cared
little
about
them
still
after
a
time
there
came
a
sort
of
reaction
a
protest
of
youth
against
the
unnatural
torpidity
of
her
present
life
her
only
friend
geoffrey
baldwin
she
saw
but
once
during
the
first
two
months
of
her
mallingford
life
for
much
to
his
regret
within
a
week
of
miss
arrival
in
the
neighbourhood
he
was
called
away
on
business
connected
with
his
own
disposal
of
a
small
property
of
his
in
a
distant
it
was
late
in
november
before
he
found
himself
free
to
return
home
it
was
very
provoking
just
when
he
had
hoped
to
be
of
some
use
to
her
to
cheer
her
a
little
in
her
present
gloomy
life
geoffrey
had
never
before
in
his
life
thought
so
much
or
so
continuously
on
any
subject
as
during
the
dull
autumn
weeks
he
thought
of
his
poor
little
ward
at
the
cross
house
he
wrote
to
her
once
or
twice
though
he
was
by
no
means
a
great
hand
at
letter
writing
and
was
immensely
delighted
with
the
answers
he
duly
received
at
last
by
the
beginning
of
december
he
found
himself
on
his
way
home
much
to
his
satisfaction
for
not
only
was
he
anxious
to
see
marion
again
but
was
also
in
a
great
state
of
fidget
about
his
hunters
the
season
had
opened
most
favourably
no
signs
of
frost
to
speak
of
and
already
he
had
missed
some
capital
days
it
was
really
too
provoking
thought
geoffrey
to
himself
as
comfortably
ensconced
in
the
railway
carriage
he
lit
his
last
pipe
before
entering
mallingford
station
the
next
day
he
rode
over
to
see
marion
being
well
acquainted
with
the
cross
house
hours
he
took
care
to
be
there
early
and
the
great
clock
in
the
market
place
was
only
just
striking
eleven
as
he
stood
on
the
door
steps
miss
tremlett
was
not
yet
visible
he
was
informed
by
the
martha
who
however
as
we
have
seen
was
more
amiable
than
she
looked
miss
vere
was
but
if
baldwin
would
step
into
the
the
young
lady
should
be
told
he
was
there
so
into
the
grim
geoffrey
stepped
grimmer
than
ever
it
looked
at
this
season
when
truly
it
takes
an
extra
amount
of
bright
colours
and
cheerful
faces
inside
to
balance
the
dismalness
of
all
things
and
this
winter
was
what
they
called
an
open
season
damp
and
dank
and
foggy
above
a
flat
unpicturesque
county
like
brentshire
whose
only
beauty
consisted
in
the
freshness
and
luxuriance
of
its
vegetation
this
was
not
the
time
to
see
it
to
advantage
geoffrey
shivered
slightly
as
he
entered
the
uninviting
room
from
physical
causes
only
he
was
not
particularly
sensitive
to
more
recondite
influences
the
fire
was
only
just
lighted
and
was
smouldering
and
sputtering
with
that
irritating
air
of
feeling
offended
at
having
been
lighted
at
all
peculiar
to
inartistically
built
fires
on
a
damp
morning
baldwin
strolled
to
the
window
and
stood
biting
the
end
of
his
riding
whip
staring
out
on
the
ugly
dreary
plot
of
ground
misnamed
a
garden
not
a
pleasant
place
for
her
to
be
in
certainly
thought
he
little
at
the
manor
farm
notwithstanding
all
the
litter
of
guns
and
and
pipes
is
a
much
more
inviting
room
than
this
to
my
mind
at
wonder
if
she
would
think
so
and
then
he
fell
to
wondering
which
of
his
horses
would
carry
him
best
to
cover
on
the
morrow
considering
the
direction
which
was
likely
to
be
taken
the
nature
of
the
ground
he
thought
suddenly
wonder
if
miss
vere
has
ever
been
at
a
meet
ask
her
bessie
certain
would
carry
a
lady
only
then
who
would
be
with
her
if
harry
were
here
it
would
be
all
right
there
are
those
copley
girls
they
are
very
and
might
ask
her
to
join
them
see
if
i
manage
but
his
further
reflections
were
interrupted
by
the
opening
of
the
door
and
the
entrance
of
marion
herself
she
knew
who
was
there
and
her
pale
face
was
slightly
flushed
with
pleasure
as
she
came
in
but
for
all
that
geoffrey
was
not
a
little
startled
by
her
appearance
she
looked
painfully
fragile
the
cold
weather
and
her
black
dress
increased
the
extreme
delicacy
of
her
complexion
and
the
almost
attenuated
look
of
her
slight
tall
figure
strangely
enough
at
that
moment
there
thrilled
through
geoffrey
the
same
foreboding
the
same
acute
misgiving
as
had
tortured
the
heart
of
ralph
severn
that
last
evening
at
altes
and
in
the
present
instance
it
acted
to
some
extent
as
a
revelation
as
his
gaze
rested
on
marion
a
tremor
seized
the
strong
man
horses
hunting
all
he
had
been
thinking
of
with
so
much
interest
but
a
moment
before
faded
from
his
mind
and
in
perfect
silence
he
touched
the
hand
so
cordially
extended
to
him
and
mechanically
drew
nearer
the
fire
a
chair
on
which
marion
seated
herself
she
did
not
observe
his
agitation
and
began
to
talk
brightly
and
heartily
am
so
glad
so
very
glad
to
see
you
again
baldwin
she
said
really
began
to
think
you
were
never
coming
back
and
i
wanted
to
tell
you
that
i
have
really
and
truly
been
doing
my
very
best
to
be
good
and
really
baldwin
it
is
drearily
inexpressibly
dull
only
answer
was
a
glance
of
sympathy
enough
however
to
encourage
her
to
proceed
did
not
seem
so
bad
at
first
she
went
on
was
more
like
a
rest
to
me
but
now
it
is
getting
very
bad
there
are
days
on
which
i
can
hardly
bear
the
terrible
monotony
and
loneliness
i
have
not
told
harry
so
for
fear
of
disturbing
him
but
i
have
wished
very
much
to
see
you
and
tell
you
baldwin
i
really
would
rather
be
a
servant
a
governess
she
was
going
to
have
said
but
the
association
was
too
painful
anything
in
the
world
than
live
on
here
like
this
always
you
are
not
angry
with
me
for
saying
this
baldwin
i
know
it
seems
childish
and
selfish
but
today
i
was
feeling
know
what
to
call
expresses
it
best
and
i
thought
it
would
be
such
a
relief
to
tell
you
about
it
but
i
hope
you
are
not
vexed
with
me
she
repeated
looking
up
at
his
face
beseechingly
with
you
my
dear
miss
vere
exclaimed
geoffrey
can
you
use
such
expressions
as
if
even
if
i
had
a
right
to
be
vexed
with
you
which
i
have
not
anything
you
could
by
any
possibility
say
or
do
could
ever
seem
to
me
am
make
pretty
speeches
least
of
all
when
i
most
mean
them
only
ever
speak
as
if
i
could
be
vexed
with
you
i
am
sorry
terribly
sorry
to
see
you
looking
so
pale
and
thin
and
to
hear
how
this
wretched
life
is
trying
you
but
what
is
to
be
done
there
is
the
difficulty
as
i
said
to
you
before
i
see
present
no
help
for
it
but
here
he
stopped
abruptly
his
fair
face
suddenly
flushing
crimson
what
baldwin
said
marion
innocently
be
afraid
to
tell
me
the
alternative
however
disagreeable
is
there
any
fresh
trouble
about
our
money
matters
dear
no
replied
the
young
man
thankful
that
he
had
not
on
the
impulse
of
the
moment
wrecked
all
by
a
premature
betrayal
of
his
hopes
and
eager
to
distract
her
attention
dear
no
get
anything
of
that
sort
into
your
head
it
is
true
i
fear
some
little
time
must
pass
before
your
affairs
are
thoroughly
settled
but
by
the
spring
at
latest
i
hope
we
may
hit
on
some
better
the
spring
repeated
marion
dolefully
well
it
does
not
much
matter
after
all
i
daresay
a
good
deal
of
the
dullness
is
in
myself
but
tell
me
baldwin
what
were
you
going
to
say
you
began
what
miss
truly
replied
geoffrey
rather
awkwardly
was
only
an
idea
that
struck
me
but
at
present
impossible
to
carry
out
please
speak
about
well
answered
marion
looking
rather
puzzled
ask
you
about
it
if
you
would
rather
i
did
not
i
am
afraid
the
truth
is
i
am
very
difficult
to
please
i
fear
in
my
present
mood
i
should
not
be
happy
anywhere
where
miss
vere
said
geoffrey
lightly
but
marion
looked
painfully
embarrassed
and
made
no
reply
a
curious
misgiving
shot
through
heart
but
he
did
not
persist
in
his
inquiry
and
turned
it
off
with
a
jest
have
both
our
secrets
you
see
he
said
laughingly
my
and
your
well
supposing
we
put
both
aside
for
the
present
and
consider
things
as
they
are
can
nothing
be
done
to
make
your
stay
here
pleasanter
so
long
as
it
lasts
said
marion
sadly
trouble
yourself
so
much
about
me
baldwin
it
is
only
a
fit
of
low
spirits
i
shall
be
better
again
in
a
day
or
two
it
is
an
immense
comfort
to
me
to
grumble
a
little
i
tell
you
how
much
good
it
does
you
are
not
looking
well
he
persisted
you
know
it
is
my
duty
to
look
after
you
this
life
is
killing
you
have
you
made
no
acquaintances
here
at
all
miss
vere
whatever
my
friends
are
all
old
like
herself
and
somehow
i
fancy
i
should
get
on
very
well
with
other
girls
baldwin
i
have
grown
so
dull
and
stupid
and
from
what
i
have
seen
of
the
mallingford
girls
at
church
and
some
few
who
call
here
with
their
mothers
i
am
sure
they
would
not
take
to
me
nor
i
to
them
no
just
leave
me
alone
i
shall
do
very
well
there
is
only
one
thing
i
wanted
to
ask
you
can
you
ask
leave
for
me
to
go
to
see
miss
veronica
temple
she
is
the
only
one
of
my
friends
that
i
remember
as
a
child
still
here
and
i
should
so
like
to
see
her
particularly
as
she
come
to
see
me
i
spoke
of
it
to
my
aunt
one
day
but
to
my
surprise
she
got
into
such
a
rage
i
was
glad
to
change
the
subject
why
does
she
dislike
miss
temple
so
baldwin
old
i
exactly
temple
replied
geoffrey
late
years
you
know
miss
tremlett
has
taken
it
into
her
head
to
become
very
low
church
and
she
insulted
the
widow
temple
very
much
one
day
by
drawing
a
comparison
between
the
state
of
church
matters
in
her
day
when
his
daughters
played
the
organ
and
dressed
up
the
just
as
they
chose
in
fact
for
he
was
the
easiest
of
good
old
the
present
condition
of
things
under
that
very
vigorous
and
vulgar
irishman
magee
who
toadies
miss
tremlett
tremendously
as
you
may
have
seen
for
indeed
replied
marion
man
he
is
i
think
and
i
am
sure
the
temples
were
the
best
and
most
charitable
of
people
how
long
has
miss
veronica
been
crippled
baldwin
i
remember
running
up
and
down
that
steep
stair
leading
to
the
organ
loft
with
harry
in
her
arms
when
we
were
quite
little
children
such
a
bright
active
creature
i
always
imagined
her
it
seems
so
sad
to
come
back
to
find
her
so
bright
and
active
still
though
she
never
leaves
her
sofa
said
geoffrey
is
one
of
the
sweetest
women
i
ever
knew
you
must
certainly
go
to
see
her
she
will
be
delighted
i
know
i
shall
call
and
ask
her
about
it
on
my
way
you
very
much
said
marion
earnestly
should
like
to
see
her
again
she
added
softly
and
then
she
sat
leaning
her
cheek
on
her
hand
gazing
silently
into
the
fire
it
was
burning
more
cheerfully
by
this
time
and
the
flickering
light
danced
fitfully
on
pale
face
for
it
was
a
very
gloomy
day
outside
and
the
dingy
room
was
in
a
sort
of
twilight
geoffrey
looked
at
her
anxiously
suddenly
he
spoke
again
you
ride
miss
he
asked
she
started
for
her
thoughts
had
been
far
away
and
he
had
to
repeat
the
words
before
she
caught
their
sense
when
she
did
so
she
answered
carelessly
little
that
is
to
say
i
have
ridden
and
i
am
not
nervous
i
liked
it
very
face
brightened
have
a
mare
that
certain
would
carry
you
beautifully
he
said
have
her
tried
i
was
thinking
if
you
were
to
make
acquaintance
with
some
of
the
girls
about
here
who
ride
you
might
come
to
a
meet
now
and
then
there
are
the
copleys
of
copley
wood
really
not
bad
girls
and
i
know
they
would
be
delighted
to
make
friends
with
but
marion
laid
her
hand
on
his
arm
should
like
to
ride
with
you
baldwin
very
much
if
you
will
be
troubled
with
me
but
i
want
to
make
any
new
acquaintances
i
know
it
seems
very
fanciful
and
unreasonable
but
i
feel
as
if
i
had
spirits
for
it
let
me
ride
alone
with
you
shall
if
you
like
miss
vere
he
replied
you
very
well
come
to
a
meet
unless
you
knew
some
of
the
other
ladies
it
be
comfortable
for
you
tell
you
how
do
have
bessie
tried
for
you
and
you
shall
have
a
few
rides
quietly
me
first
and
then
if
you
like
it
arrange
for
the
copley
girls
to
ask
you
to
join
their
party
to
the
next
meet
at
a
convenient
distance
you
object
to
this
riding
will
do
you
good
i
know
and
if
you
ride
i
shall
not
be
satisfied
unless
you
come
to
see
the
meets
what
do
you
say
to
this
you
are
too
good
to
me
baldwin
and
i
should
be
shamefully
ungrateful
if
i
did
not
do
whatever
you
wish
i
shall
look
out
my
habit
today
i
expect
it
will
be
much
too
big
for
me
i
have
got
so
thin
she
said
lightly
geoffrey
looked
at
the
hand
she
had
laid
in
his
it
was
indeed
white
and
wasted
darling
he
whispered
under
his
breath
so
low
that
she
had
no
suspicion
of
the
inaudible
words
then
he
dropped
it
gently
and
looking
up
said
cheerfully
right
then
you
may
expect
to
see
me
some
day
with
bessie
all
ready
for
you
goodbye
and
do
try
to
get
some
more
colour
in
your
cheeks
by
the
next
time
i
see
you
guardians
are
allowed
to
make
rude
remarks
you
know
he
added
laughingly
it
all
for
their
and
with
another
shake
of
her
hand
he
left
her
very
kind
he
is
thought
marion
wonder
if
it
could
possibly
do
any
good
for
me
to
tell
him
all
about
it
but
no
she
decided
on
thinking
it
over
she
had
done
as
much
as
seemed
to
her
right
and
fitting
more
would
be
undignified
and
unmaidenly
and
then
she
was
so
utterly
in
the
dark
what
might
not
have
occurred
since
she
left
altes
ralph
could
not
be
dead
of
that
she
was
certain
he
could
not
have
died
without
her
knowing
it
but
a
worse
thing
might
have
come
to
pass
at
this
very
moment
for
all
she
knew
to
the
contrary
he
might
be
already
the
husband
of
another
woman
not
in
heart
she
said
to
herself
was
not
the
man
to
love
twice
not
at
least
so
quickly
and
never
while
he
lives
will
he
love
another
as
he
loved
me
in
this
at
least
he
is
thus
she
felt
in
certain
moods
there
were
others
however
in
which
her
faith
was
less
undoubting
in
which
she
almost
questioned
if
she
had
not
exaggerated
what
he
had
said
whether
after
all
it
had
not
been
with
ralph
a
much
less
serious
affair
than
to
her
cost
it
had
been
with
her
then
again
she
seemed
drawn
the
other
way
his
was
no
slight
or
shallow
nature
were
his
depth
and
earnestness
to
be
doubted
in
what
could
she
ever
allow
herself
to
believe
and
so
the
poor
child
was
tossed
and
torn
still
it
came
to
pass
thanks
to
geoffrey
baldwin
that
a
little
more
brightness
and
enjoyment
were
at
this
time
infused
into
her
daily
life
the
riding
proved
a
success
and
as
her
young
guardian
observed
with
did
bring
some
colour
to
her
the
copley
girls
came
up
to
favourable
account
of
them
and
did
their
best
in
the
way
of
showing
kindness
to
pretty
pale
miss
vere
that
geoffrey
baldwin
is
so
taken
up
they
were
hearty
healthy
girls
and
both
engaged
to
be
married
to
the
most
satisfactory
partis
possibly
this
last
had
something
to
say
to
their
cordial
reception
of
their
old
interesting
ward
the
renewal
of
her
acquaintance
with
the
invalid
miss
temple
was
also
in
a
different
way
a
source
of
great
pleasure
to
marion
trifling
incidents
introduction
to
the
copley
girls
and
her
meeting
again
with
the
kind
they
both
influenced
her
indirectly
in
the
great
decision
of
her
life
towards
which
though
she
knew
it
not
the
tide
of
affairs
was
rapidly
drawing
her
chapter
viii
and
ralph
by
a
mortal
yearning
to
ascend
seeking
a
higher
laodamia
love
and
beauty
and
delight
there
is
no
death
nor
change
their
might
exceeds
our
organs
which
endure
no
light
being
themselves
the
sensitive
plant
ah
yes
what
of
ralph
through
all
these
months
to
marion
so
weary
with
suspense
and
disappointment
what
had
he
been
about
how
came
it
that
he
whom
we
have
heard
vowing
to
himself
that
her
happiness
should
be
his
first
consideration
had
allowed
her
thus
to
suffer
when
as
we
know
a
word
from
him
at
any
moment
would
have
set
all
right
would
have
made
the
world
rosy
again
and
filled
with
sunlight
even
the
grim
old
house
at
mallingford
to
explain
it
all
to
show
what
a
strange
chain
of
commonplace
mistakes
and
had
coupled
with
one
small
act
of
deliberate
malice
effected
all
the
mischief
tortured
with
doubt
and
misgiving
two
true
hearts
and
altogether
changed
the
course
of
two
if
not
three
make
all
this
clear
we
must
step
back
some
way
to
the
very
time
indeed
we
last
heard
of
ralph
heard
of
him
only
incidentally
as
having
been
successful
in
obtaining
the
promise
of
sir
archibald
or
rather
through
his
influence
that
of
the
powers
that
be
in
such
matters
with
respect
to
the
expected
consular
vacancy
at
that
was
the
last
i
think
that
we
know
of
him
thus
far
excepting
an
peep
of
him
more
recently
in
his
swiss
maison
de
campaigne
where
the
severns
were
domesticated
for
the
summer
to
return
however
to
the
day
in
march
on
which
hopeful
and
elated
as
i
think
i
said
ralph
set
out
again
for
altes
having
succeeded
in
the
mission
which
had
brought
him
across
the
water
the
journey
back
was
a
much
more
cheerful
affair
than
had
been
that
to
england
ralph
was
not
naturally
by
any
means
given
to
about
money
fact
his
actual
experience
of
limited
means
had
been
but
small
for
he
had
always
had
enough
for
moderate
requirements
but
he
was
a
thoroughly
conscientious
man
many
would
say
morbidly
so
and
i
daresay
there
might
be
nothing
exaggerated
or
unreasonable
in
such
an
opinion
very
quiet
and
reserved
people
are
apt
to
become
morbid
on
some
point
they
get
hold
of
a
notion
and
turn
it
round
and
round
in
their
minds
till
a
sort
of
mental
dizziness
very
adverse
to
clear
judgement
results
it
is
a
grand
thing
now
and
then
to
get
a
fresh
outside
opinion
on
matters
about
which
we
are
deeply
interested
nor
is
the
soundness
of
that
opinion
of
as
much
moment
as
might
be
imagined
its
freshness
is
the
great
thing
for
assuredly
though
directly
it
may
not
influence
our
eventual
decision
our
own
powers
of
judgement
will
by
its
breezy
rush
through
our
cobwebbed
brain
become
marvellously
invigorated
and
braced
for
the
work
which
after
all
to
be
well
done
must
be
their
own
and
no
one
such
had
been
on
ralph
the
effect
of
his
rare
confidence
in
other
as
will
be
remembered
having
been
the
sensible
but
nevertheless
quite
sufficiently
price
from
the
date
of
his
long
talk
with
his
odd
tutor
the
young
bewilderments
fors
and
againsts
conflicting
duties
and
inclinations
ranged
themselves
with
wonderful
order
and
celerity
it
was
all
nonsense
humbug
he
soon
learnt
to
call
it
about
his
being
different
from
other
men
cut
off
by
peculiar
circumstances
from
what
after
all
in
plain
honest
english
is
every
to
please
himself
in
the
choice
of
the
helpmeet
without
which
providence
certainly
never
intended
him
or
any
other
young
man
to
go
through
life
provided
of
course
the
prospective
helpmeet
saw
things
in
the
same
way
as
he
of
which
heaven
be
thanked
he
had
no
reasonable
grounds
to
doubt
what
he
could
do
without
too
much
going
out
of
his
way
or
any
approach
to
unmanly
subservience
to
conciliate
his
mother
he
would
but
beyond
a
certain
point
he
now
saw
clearly
it
was
not
his
duty
to
defer
to
her
should
she
show
herself
inclined
to
be
reasonable
which
state
of
things
however
he
at
present
felt
far
from
sanguine
about
he
would
be
only
too
ready
to
meet
her
at
any
point
on
the
friendly
road
he
would
in
any
case
swallow
his
pride
to
the
extent
of
accepting
from
her
whatever
amount
of
pecuniary
assistance
she
saw
fit
to
afford
him
pride
indeed
was
hardly
the
word
for
it
for
in
a
sense
the
property
was
his
own
though
at
present
unfortunately
not
to
be
obtained
but
by
her
and
if
she
took
it
into
her
head
to
stand
out
and
refuse
him
anything
well
then
he
had
the
appointment
at
to
fall
back
upon
the
securing
of
which
his
practical
good
sense
and
advice
had
shown
him
to
be
the
one
distinct
duty
before
him
without
which
as
a
certainty
however
small
he
had
no
right
to
allow
the
fortunes
of
another
to
be
joined
to
his
what
he
had
said
to
marion
before
leaving
altes
had
not
been
on
impulse
each
word
each
look
and
gesture
that
last
evening
when
she
had
shown
him
in
her
innocence
the
whole
depths
of
her
pure
loving
heart
and
tempted
him
sorely
to
say
but
one
word
more
to
press
her
if
but
for
an
instant
to
his
word
and
glance
that
evening
he
had
rigidly
controlled
and
acted
throughout
implicitly
as
he
believed
to
be
for
the
best
from
the
light
of
after
results
we
now
may
question
if
he
did
wisely
if
after
all
it
had
not
been
better
to
have
gone
further
or
not
so
far
from
the
top
of
the
hill
it
requires
no
great
wisdom
to
look
back
and
say
which
would
have
been
the
best
road
up
but
this
is
not
how
we
are
meant
to
travel
our
slowly
and
toilfully
with
but
little
light
and
what
there
is
often
dazzling
and
deceptive
with
bleeding
feet
and
trembling
limbs
we
creep
step
beyond
often
the
limit
of
our
darkened
view
this
is
how
the
allwise
sees
fit
to
train
us
doubt
not
and
judge
not
when
at
last
we
climb
beyond
the
mists
and
fogs
though
that
time
may
be
still
a
far
way
off
we
shall
see
that
it
was
for
the
best
but
no
misgiving
of
this
kind
came
to
torment
ralph
on
his
way
back
as
he
thought
to
the
woman
from
whom
no
reasonable
barrier
now
divided
him
to
put
it
in
its
very
worst
light
said
he
to
himself
a
feat
your
very
conscientious
people
are
strangely
fond
of
performing
if
my
health
gives
way
and
i
have
to
throw
up
the
appointment
my
mother
is
not
so
utterly
devoid
of
natural
affection
as
to
let
us
starve
while
she
is
rolling
in
wealth
and
even
if
i
were
to
die
and
leave
my
darling
alone
why
we
should
have
had
our
little
hit
of
happiness
which
surely
is
better
than
to
have
had
none
at
all
and
if
my
marion
had
a
child
or
children
he
murmured
to
himself
softly
would
force
my
mother
to
take
an
interest
in
her
for
the
old
sake
it
would
not
seem
quite
so
bad
to
leave
her
if
she
had
boys
and
girls
about
her
she
seems
so
very
lonely
poor
child
except
for
archer
who
after
all
is
only
a
friend
though
i
really
know
why
i
should
think
myself
likely
to
die
i
am
perfectly
healthy
though
not
very
robust
death
i
think
put
it
into
my
head
that
i
should
not
live
to
be
and
then
in
thought
he
wandered
off
to
picturing
to
himself
where
and
when
he
could
best
manage
to
see
marion
alone
wonder
if
she
thought
me
cold
he
said
to
himself
must
have
seemed
so
but
still
i
am
sure
she
understood
me
she
has
a
wonderfully
quick
and
delicate
sympathy
yes
i
am
certain
she
understood
me
or
she
would
not
have
trusted
me
so
the
only
unsatisfactory
remembrance
i
have
of
our
conversation
is
of
her
sudden
distress
when
she
bethought
herself
of
what
she
hinted
at
as
a
barrier
on
her
side
what
could
it
be
some
disgrace
in
her
family
something
connected
with
her
father
but
that
will
soon
be
explained
and
set
straight
nothing
not
actually
affecting
herself
could
conic
between
so
he
whiled
away
the
many
hours
of
his
journey
tedious
only
in
so
far
as
the
days
seemed
long
till
he
could
see
her
again
hear
repeated
by
her
own
lips
the
sweet
assurance
which
had
he
been
a
vainer
or
more
conventional
man
he
would
have
read
many
a
time
ere
now
in
her
changing
colour
the
varying
tones
of
her
voice
the
childlike
trust
and
appeal
in
her
innocent
eyes
when
she
raised
them
to
his
i
know
that
ever
ralph
severn
was
happier
than
during
this
journey
back
to
altes
truly
this
falling
in
love
of
his
had
done
great
things
for
him
sunnied
his
whole
nature
and
for
the
first
time
revealed
to
him
the
marvellous
beauty
there
is
in
this
life
of
ours
the
light
and
joy
which
underlie
it
our
intense
powers
of
happiness
no
less
than
of
suffering
all
which
things
being
real
and
true
whatever
be
the
dark
mysteries
for
the
present
on
the
other
side
it
was
i
doubt
not
well
for
him
to
have
had
a
glimpse
of
them
an
actual
personal
experience
of
happiness
however
we
speak
fluently
of
the
discipline
of
suffering
is
nothing
to
be
learnt
from
its
twin
sister
joy
or
is
she
sent
but
to
mock
us
i
can
not
think
so
her
visits
may
be
short
and
rare
but
some
good
gift
of
enduring
kind
she
surely
leaves
behind
if
only
blinded
by
the
tears
we
shed
at
her
departure
we
did
not
fail
to
see
it
such
however
it
seems
to
me
is
not
the
case
with
the
highest
and
deepest
natures
to
them
i
think
all
life
experience
is
but
as
fresh
and
precious
soil
in
a
garden
where
all
is
turned
to
good
account
sooner
or
later
there
may
be
ugly
and
unsightly
things
about
the
flowers
when
withered
may
seem
to
pollute
the
air
and
cumber
the
ground
but
only
to
our
ignorance
does
it
appear
so
under
the
great
all
is
arranged
nothing
overlooked
every
shower
of
rain
every
ray
of
sunshine
has
its
peculiar
mission
all
influences
tend
to
the
one
great
end
in
view
the
ultimate
perfection
of
the
work
if
only
the
gardener
be
humble
and
willing
patient
and
withal
earnest
to
learn
then
even
from
his
mistakes
he
shall
gain
precious
and
lasting
fruit
ralph
character
was
no
shallow
one
his
love
for
marion
was
as
i
have
said
the
one
great
affection
of
his
life
and
something
his
nature
gained
from
its
present
happiness
that
it
never
afterwards
lost
something
indefinite
and
subtle
but
an
influence
for
good
it
was
late
in
the
evening
when
he
reached
altes
his
mother
and
miss
vyse
ignorant
of
the
precise
hour
at
which
his
arrival
might
be
expected
were
just
about
leaving
the
for
the
night
the
children
of
course
were
in
bed
but
in
the
fulness
of
his
happy
heart
ralph
went
and
kissed
little
sybil
as
she
lay
asleep
how
forcibly
it
reminded
him
of
his
last
return
to
the
rue
des
lauriers
he
only
saw
lady
severn
and
his
for
a
very
few
minutes
but
even
in
that
time
his
quick
perception
revealed
to
him
some
slight
change
in
the
manner
of
both
in
florence
it
was
the
most
marked
her
tone
seemed
to
him
more
natural
because
more
unrestrained
a
sort
of
contemptuous
indifference
to
him
united
to
something
of
triumph
and
secret
satisfaction
peeped
out
in
her
carelessly
rather
condescending
greeting
she
was
looking
very
well
too
exceedingly
radiant
and
handsome
her
white
skin
appeared
positively
dazzling
her
clear
black
eyebrows
in
their
faultless
curve
relieving
what
might
otherwise
have
been
too
for
attractive
living
beauty
her
glorious
hair
in
which
nestled
a
cluster
of
crimson
roses
of
a
peculiar
and
shade
by
contrast
browning
the
surface
they
lay
on
shone
a
mass
of
burnished
gold
for
by
candlelight
the
tinge
of
red
only
intensified
its
lustre
and
richness
she
stood
thus
for
a
moment
under
the
full
glare
of
the
rash
thing
for
any
but
a
perfectly
beautiful
woman
to
do
but
florence
knew
herself
to
be
one
of
the
few
whose
charms
are
immensely
increased
by
such
an
eyes
cast
so
if
she
were
challenging
the
young
admiration
for
wonderfully
fine
as
they
were
ralph
never
could
succeed
in
admiring
them
nor
her
when
he
felt
them
fixed
on
his
face
she
was
dressed
in
black
something
soft
and
sweeping
but
yet
intensely
black
and
from
out
of
its
midst
curved
her
round
white
arms
rose
her
beautiful
dazzling
neck
and
throat
on
which
lay
some
heavy
coils
of
dull
red
gold
chain
or
beads
a
golden
rope
was
the
appearance
they
presented
at
a
little
distance
or
thought
ralph
as
in
his
glance
he
saw
the
coils
heave
slightly
as
she
breathed
they
like
some
magical
snake
she
has
bewitched
to
serve
her
purpose
it
was
a
silly
fancy
but
it
dispelled
the
momentary
impression
of
her
great
beauty
which
not
to
have
been
struck
by
one
must
needs
have
been
less
or
more
than
human
can
she
be
after
now
thought
ralph
with
some
misgiving
this
very
effective
must
have
been
done
with
a
purpose
and
her
uncommonly
cool
tone
rather
a
change
from
the
oily
manner
she
used
to
favour
me
with
though
upon
my
word
i
think
an
improvement
can
she
be
intending
to
try
to
pique
me
no
she
would
never
be
so
silly
besides
they
did
not
know
i
was
coming
i
declare
i
believe
she
has
got
hold
of
some
one
else
how
i
pity
the
poor
devil
all
the
same
from
personal
motives
i
refrain
from
wishing
her
and
half
puzzled
half
amused
he
turned
to
his
mother
well
you
are
looking
ralph
broke
from
her
involuntarily
and
it
was
very
true
for
all
that
he
was
tired
and
for
he
had
come
in
to
see
his
mother
before
changing
his
clothes
the
young
man
certainly
looked
his
very
best
there
was
a
healthy
brown
flush
under
his
somewhat
sallow
skin
which
improved
him
vastly
and
showed
to
advantage
the
dark
rather
too
deep
set
eyes
whose
colour
i
never
could
succeed
in
defining
his
figure
always
lithe
and
sinewy
seemed
to
have
gained
in
vigour
and
erectness
he
looked
both
taller
and
stronger
his
whole
carriage
told
of
greater
heartiness
and
elasticity
a
quicker
and
healthier
flow
of
the
in
his
veins
he
looked
pleased
at
the
gratification
involuntarily
displayed
in
his
tone
for
till
then
her
manner
had
chilled
and
perplexed
him
she
was
more
cordial
than
when
he
had
left
her
but
she
looked
uneasy
and
depressed
and
received
him
with
the
manner
of
one
almost
against
her
convictions
allowing
to
return
to
favour
a
but
culprit
her
you
are
back
again
ah
well
had
something
rather
piteous
in
its
tone
of
reproach
and
resignation
but
was
at
the
same
time
exceedingly
irritating
bygones
be
bygones
it
seemed
to
say
have
been
an
undutiful
son
but
i
am
the
most
magnanimous
and
of
underlying
all
this
however
was
a
different
feeling
an
evident
anxiety
as
to
his
evinced
by
the
heartiness
of
her
exclamation
as
to
his
satisfactory
looks
and
besides
this
he
felt
convinced
she
was
concealing
something
which
she
believed
would
distress
him
for
with
all
her
and
class
prejudice
lady
severn
was
the
most
transparent
and
of
women
he
could
not
make
it
out
nor
ask
to
have
it
explained
for
joined
to
his
constitutional
reserve
his
mother
and
he
were
not
never
had
been
on
such
terms
as
to
allow
him
frankly
to
beg
her
to
confide
to
him
the
cause
of
her
evident
uneasiness
so
they
separated
for
the
night
he
happy
man
to
forget
all
mysteries
and
misgivings
in
the
thought
of
meeting
with
marion
poor
ralph
the
morning
came
only
too
soon
to
dispel
his
dream
he
did
not
see
the
children
at
breakfast
as
usual
and
on
expressing
his
surprise
was
told
by
his
mother
that
they
now
breakfasted
separately
as
otherwise
it
made
them
too
late
for
their
lessons
does
miss
freer
come
earlier
now
was
on
his
tongue
to
ask
but
something
in
the
air
of
satisfaction
with
which
florence
was
sipping
her
coffee
stopped
his
intention
shall
not
mention
my
name
before
her
he
said
to
himself
a
few
minutes
later
lotty
and
sybil
ran
in
for
one
moment
grandmamma
clamorous
in
their
welcome
of
their
truant
uncle
while
they
were
still
busy
hugging
sir
ralph
the
bell
rang
come
lotty
do
said
sybil
the
virtuous
will
be
miss
brown
quoth
ralph
in
haste
on
earth
is
she
governess
since
miss
freer
left
replied
lotty
sybil
was
as
yet
incapable
of
approaching
the
subject
of
miss
departure
without
tears
and
therefore
was
wise
enough
to
leave
the
explanation
to
less
sensitive
tongue
you
know
uncle
ralph
that
miss
freer
had
left
she
went
away
with
archer
but
she
would
have
left
off
teaching
us
at
any
rate
grandmamma
thought
she
was
not
enough
for
us
now
we
are
getting
so
big
not
instructed
enough
though
she
was
very
kind
miss
brown
plays
far
grander
on
the
piano
you
can
hear
her
quite
across
the
street
just
like
the
band
on
the
place
and
said
her
grandmother
sharply
talk
much
too
fast
it
is
not
for
little
girls
like
you
to
discuss
their
elders
go
now
both
of
you
at
once
to
miss
brown
and
be
good
lotty
disappeared
instantly
sybil
lingered
one
little
short
moment
to
kiss
her
uncle
softly
once
more
and
then
followed
her
sister
what
had
the
read
of
the
sorrow
the
sudden
sharp
pang
of
bitter
disappointment
that
thrilled
through
the
strong
man
in
whom
her
innocence
she
instinctively
wished
to
comfort
for
once
in
his
life
ralph
felt
thankful
for
tongue
its
chatter
gave
him
an
instant
in
which
to
recover
himself
to
rally
his
scattered
forces
and
decide
on
his
present
course
perfect
silence
he
was
not
in
the
habit
of
betraying
his
feelings
and
certainly
his
powers
of
must
not
fail
him
now
for
the
gratification
of
the
heartless
beauty
at
his
board
his
first
impulse
had
been
to
rise
in
the
strength
of
his
wrath
and
indignation
to
have
done
for
once
in
a
way
with
conventional
restrictions
and
to
hurl
bitter
biting
words
at
her
who
in
his
inmost
heart
he
believed
to
be
the
author
of
all
this
it
was
well
he
did
not
do
so
florence
was
prepared
for
it
would
have
enjoyed
it
immensely
and
would
certainly
have
remained
mistress
of
the
field
his
heroics
would
have
been
altogether
out
of
place
as
a
very
few
minutes
sufficed
to
show
him
and
would
but
have
exposed
himself
and
another
to
ridicule
and
derision
for
what
would
florence
have
answered
she
had
the
words
all
ready
dear
ralph
what
do
you
mean
my
dearest
aunt
has
your
son
gone
out
of
his
mind
how
can
i
of
all
people
be
responsible
for
having
been
called
to
india
to
nurse
her
husband
or
to
the
movements
of
the
young
lady
visiting
her
truly
sir
ralph
you
must
excuse
me
but
just
ask
should
i
be
supposed
to
take
so
extraordinary
an
interest
in
every
young
lady
my
aunt
sees
it
to
engage
to
teach
your
nieces
and
still
more
what
possible
reason
could
i
have
for
supposing
this
particular
young
lady
to
be
an
object
of
interest
to
you
it
is
not
usual
to
say
the
least
for
the
gentleman
of
the
house
to
have
an
understanding
with
the
governess
which
memorable
speech
however
was
never
destined
to
be
uttered
ralph
thought
better
of
it
and
decided
to
nurse
his
wrath
and
keep
his
own
counsel
there
is
a
great
deal
of
nonsense
spoken
and
written
about
truth
and
truth
tellers
the
most
exalted
characters
in
a
certain
of
class
fiction
can
never
bring
themselves
without
a
tremendous
fuss
either
to
utter
or
act
a
falsehood
and
if
they
ever
attempt
either
they
are
sure
to
bungle
it
spite
of
themselves
ingenuous
nature
betrays
itself
lips
scorn
to
descend
to
the
meanness
it
is
not
so
in
real
life
i
know
of
no
persons
who
when
they
are
put
to
it
can
tell
a
falsehood
better
or
act
it
more
cleverly
than
essentially
truthful
because
natures
the
reason
i
fancy
lies
somewhere
in
this
direction
it
takes
some
strength
some
resolution
to
do
something
they
thoroughly
dislike
and
so
they
having
for
it
feeling
the
necessity
of
the
disagreeable
action
do
it
to
the
best
of
their
ability
set
their
shoulder
to
the
wheel
and
go
through
with
it
with
a
will
this
is
how
to
my
experience
really
thorough
people
tell
stories
ralph
did
his
bit
of
falsity
very
neatly
all
the
same
alas
florence
saw
through
it
he
did
not
it
he
looked
up
with
a
sufficiently
concerned
expression
saying
to
his
mother
me
i
am
sorry
to
hear
archer
has
left
and
miss
freer
too
it
must
have
been
a
sudden
sudden
indeed
replied
his
moving
most
completely
taken
in
and
evidently
not
a
little
relieved
and
delighted
archer
was
in
dreadful
distress
she
is
to
sail
almost
immediately
she
would
have
gone
straight
to
marseilles
from
this
but
she
had
some
business
she
was
obliged
to
attend
to
personally
in
said
ralph
understand
what
is
all
the
dreadful
distress
about
exclaimed
his
mother
thought
you
knew
had
you
not
heard
of
poor
george
illness
launched
on
which
topic
she
sailed
away
calmly
for
some
minutes
did
she
take
the
child
with
her
asked
ralph
little
the
young
lady
miss
freer
did
she
go
too
are
they
going
to
india
together
really
know
said
lady
severn
forget
sure
if
little
charlie
is
to
go
and
as
to
miss
freer
i
know
still
less
she
was
a
peculiar
young
woman
never
even
mentioned
where
her
home
was
in
always
understood
began
florence
but
on
lady
pressing
her
to
tell
what
she
had
understood
she
to
use
a
very
charming
schoolboy
phrase
up
and
could
not
be
prevailed
on
to
say
more
murmuring
something
about
liking
to
repeat
gossip
she
rose
gracefully
from
table
and
the
little
party
separated
later
in
the
morning
ralph
sauntered
into
the
where
the
two
ladies
were
sitting
is
rather
tiresome
he
said
having
left
before
i
returned
i
had
something
to
send
to
her
husband
i
think
my
best
way
will
be
write
to
her
at
once
and
ask
directions
for
sending
it
to
her
do
you
happen
to
know
her
address
yes
said
his
mother
unsuspiciously
gave
it
to
me
the
last
day
i
saw
her
i
gave
it
to
you
florence
my
dear
but
i
remember
it
i
have
a
good
head
for
addresses
it
george
archer
care
of
archer
west
parade
leamington
that
is
it
i
know
i
am
right
florence
my
dear
am
i
not
miss
vyse
did
not
answer
for
a
moment
then
she
said
slowly
sulkily
it
seemed
to
ralph
which
confirmed
him
in
his
opinion
that
the
address
was
correct
aunt
you
are
quite
right
but
i
have
the
address
upstairs
if
you
wish
i
can
run
up
and
refer
to
thank
you
said
ralph
am
quite
satisfied
west
parade
leamington
i
shall
not
forget
it
good
thing
he
thought
to
himself
my
mother
really
has
a
correct
memory
for
addresses
even
if
that
girl
showed
me
an
address
in
own
writing
i
should
not
believe
it
was
correct
if
it
had
passed
through
her
the
greater
part
of
that
day
he
spent
in
writing
to
marion
it
was
all
he
could
do
and
he
did
it
thoroughly
entering
without
reserve
into
all
his
hopes
and
plans
only
passing
by
rather
more
slightly
the
probable
opposition
his
marriage
might
meet
with
from
his
mother
and
inferring
that
any
mischief
to
be
apprehended
on
this
score
was
already
done
by
his
having
months
before
refused
to
marry
as
she
wished
he
impressed
upon
marion
that
he
was
far
from
rich
that
indeed
for
many
years
to
come
their
life
might
be
a
struggling
one
and
told
her
the
object
and
success
of
his
visit
to
london
he
begged
her
to
reply
at
once
and
to
confide
to
him
the
he
called
it
obstacle
on
her
side
the
remembrance
of
which
had
so
distressed
her
that
it
was
imaginary
only
he
told
her
he
felt
assured
for
nothing
not
affecting
her
personally
would
he
allow
to
come
between
them
whatever
it
was
he
begged
her
to
tell
it
to
him
lastly
he
entreated
her
to
send
him
word
where
and
when
he
might
see
her
at
any
moment
he
wrote
he
would
hold
himself
in
readiness
to
set
off
for
england
to
see
her
in
her
own
home
or
wherever
else
she
might
appoint
one
possibility
only
he
did
not
allude
to
for
as
yet
it
had
not
seriously
occurred
to
him
that
of
her
perhaps
having
determined
on
accompanying
archer
to
india
later
he
wondered
at
its
not
having
struck
him
so
he
wrote
his
letter
and
enclosed
it
to
the
care
of
george
archer
to
be
by
her
forwarded
or
delivered
immediately
and
having
posted
it
with
his
own
hand
he
felt
rather
lighter
of
heart
than
had
been
the
case
with
him
since
his
grievous
disappointment
of
the
morning
he
tried
to
reason
himself
out
of
his
excessive
depression
all
thought
he
is
nothing
to
be
so
miserable
about
it
is
merely
a
question
of
a
week
or
delay
and
now
i
can
console
myself
by
counting
the
days
till
her
answer
can
but
it
was
not
much
use
from
the
first
moment
that
he
had
heard
her
departure
carelessly
alluded
to
he
had
somehow
lost
hope
felt
an
irresistible
conviction
that
she
was
altogether
and
for
ever
gone
from
him
was
very
childish
he
said
to
himself
and
but
he
could
not
help
it
still
he
did
not
allow
his
depression
to
paralyse
or
weaken
his
efforts
to
obviate
the
harm
too
likely
in
one
form
or
another
to
have
been
caused
by
sudden
and
departure
more
he
would
gladly
have
done
for
once
his
letter
was
written
and
despatched
the
forced
inaction
and
miserable
suspense
tried
him
terribly
many
times
in
the
course
of
the
next
few
days
he
was
on
the
point
of
starting
off
again
for
england
but
on
refection
he
always
discarded
the
idea
he
was
so
utterly
without
knowledge
of
past
history
and
present
circumstances
what
where
or
who
her
friends
were
he
had
no
idea
of
everything
in
fact
save
herself
her
own
sweet
personality
he
was
entirely
ignorant
were
he
to
find
his
way
to
her
by
means
of
his
only
clue
the
address
of
the
senior
archer
it
might
do
more
harm
than
good
might
injure
his
cause
irretrievably
the
father
to
whom
she
had
all
alluded
with
more
dread
than
affection
concerning
whom
there
was
evidently
some
sad
or
shameful
page
in
her
young
history
what
might
he
not
be
how
might
not
appearance
irritate
or
exasperate
him
how
might
it
not
pain
or
distress
her
whose
peace
and
were
truly
as
he
had
said
his
first
consideration
there
was
no
question
of
it
he
decided
calmly
and
dispassionately
he
had
done
well
to
write
to
her
in
the
first
place
and
till
he
received
her
answer
he
must
take
no
more
open
or
decisive
steps
it
might
be
though
hardly
to
himself
would
he
own
the
dreadful
doubt
yet
it
might
be
that
on
her
side
the
obstacles
would
prove
stubborn
even
altogether
insurmountable
in
that
case
with
the
terrible
possibility
before
him
he
would
do
well
for
her
sake
far
more
than
for
his
own
to
guard
his
secret
to
save
her
name
from
even
a
breath
of
coarse
innuendo
or
reproach
which
once
under
the
acknowledged
shelter
of
his
love
and
protection
would
fall
harmless
but
might
should
it
attack
her
without
such
defence
wound
and
sting
her
through
all
her
pure
guileless
innocence
of
thought
and
deed
to
know
that
she
was
spoken
of
as
miss
freer
who
tried
her
best
to
catch
sir
ralph
severn
but
who
found
it
no
use
as
lady
severn
discovered
that
or
was
the
case
would
be
too
horrible
from
this
at
least
he
could
save
her
sometimes
it
struck
him
as
hard
that
she
had
left
no
message
for
him
no
farewell
greeting
or
word
of
remembrance
but
then
again
when
he
recalled
the
particulars
of
their
last
conversation
the
extreme
reserve
and
guardedness
with
which
purposefully
he
had
referred
to
his
plans
and
intentions
the
fears
he
had
expressed
that
his
efforts
might
be
in
this
to
which
he
judged
it
right
to
confine
himself
so
that
in
case
of
adverse
results
she
might
in
no
wise
consider
herself
bound
to
could
not
find
it
in
his
heart
to
blame
her
no
girl
in
her
place
could
have
been
expected
to
do
more
few
very
few
would
have
trusted
him
as
she
had
done
so
he
waited
to
outward
appearance
patiently
enough
for
the
coming
of
the
earliest
day
on
which
he
might
reasonably
expect
an
answer
to
his
letter
during
these
days
the
mystery
of
miss
altered
manner
and
continued
succession
of
gorgeous
was
to
some
extent
explained
she
had
really
succeeded
in
attaching
another
string
and
that
other
by
no
means
a
despicable
one
to
her
bow
the
first
day
of
his
return
they
dined
as
usual
alone
florence
complained
of
being
tired
and
left
the
early
the
following
morning
lady
severn
informed
her
son
that
dinner
was
to
be
later
that
day
as
she
expected
a
guest
gentleman
she
added
as
if
she
wished
ralph
to
enquire
further
but
he
was
too
profoundly
indifferent
to
do
so
and
forgot
all
about
the
matter
till
just
before
when
to
his
amazement
on
entering
the
he
descried
seated
side
by
side
on
a
sofa
in
very
suspicious
proximity
florence
the
magnificent
and
our
old
friend
the
substantial
and
inconsolable
widower
chepstow
he
is
the
poor
devil
i
was
pitying
in
anticipation
thought
ralph
the
whole
i
think
the
sentiment
is
his
back
is
broad
enough
and
his
susceptibilities
not
too
acute
besides
which
he
is
the
kind
of
man
that
must
be
ruled
and
perhaps
when
he
is
incorporated
as
a
part
of
her
precious
self
florence
may
not
treat
him
badly
she
will
have
no
more
need
for
plotting
and
planning
on
pecuniary
grounds
chepstow
was
all
beaming
with
the
effulgence
of
prosperity
and
delighted
to
see
sir
ralph
again
hoped
he
had
enjoyed
his
visit
to
england
etc
ralph
felt
rather
at
a
loss
how
to
demean
himself
the
thing
was
so
very
palpable
he
wondered
if
he
was
expected
to
congratulate
the
happy
pair
forthwith
but
as
there
had
been
no
announcement
made
to
him
he
decided
that
it
was
better
to
be
on
the
safe
side
and
risk
no
premature
good
wishes
it
was
a
very
tiresome
evening
chepstow
bored
him
inexpressibly
the
more
so
that
being
his
guest
he
felt
bound
to
be
civil
to
the
millionaire
after
dinner
he
was
doomed
to
a
very
exhausting
in
the
course
of
which
the
stout
widower
unbosomed
himself
described
in
glowing
terms
his
admiration
for
miss
vyse
and
ended
by
expressing
his
hopes
that
sir
ralph
would
look
favourably
on
the
proposed
alliance
am
very
happy
to
hear
of
it
i
assure
you
chepstow
replied
ralph
you
are
mistaken
in
thinking
my
approval
has
anything
to
say
to
the
matter
miss
vyse
is
very
distantly
related
to
me
and
though
she
has
been
staying
with
my
mother
for
some
time
i
am
very
slightly
acquainted
with
her
she
is
i
believe
quite
her
own
mistress
it
think
her
fortunate
in
the
prospect
of
a
kind
husband
and
you
on
your
side
i
need
not
tell
you
will
have
an
exceedingly
handsome
wife
may
i
ask
when
do
you
call
it
event
that
the
proper
expression
is
to
take
place
rosy
completion
visibly
deepened
in
hue
have
not
exactly
fixed
in
fact
my
dear
sir
ralph
miss
vyse
is
a
young
lady
of
such
exceedingly
delicate
had
wished
her
to
name
an
early
day
but
she
rather
objects
to
our
marriage
taking
place
till
the
anniversary
of
the
late
death
has
passed
indeed
said
the
younger
man
that
anniversary
falls
about
this
season
i
suppose
ah
well
a
few
delay
will
give
you
time
to
know
each
other
better
i
forget
how
many
years
you
have
been
a
chepstow
looked
still
more
uncomfortable
late
wife
chepstow
he
said
in
june
i
thought
i
mentioned
that
miss
vyse
wished
to
postpone
matters
till
after
the
anniversary
was
late
wife
only
died
last
june
then
exclaimed
sir
ralph
feeling
considerably
disgusted
i
certainly
agree
with
miss
vyse
as
to
the
propriety
of
deferring
the
present
affair
a
little
this
was
rather
a
damper
even
to
the
obtuse
chepstow
he
looked
rather
ashamed
of
himself
and
appeared
glad
to
agree
to
his
proposal
that
they
should
return
to
the
wonder
what
sort
of
a
person
the
first
mrs
chepstow
was
thought
ralph
somewhat
cynically
as
he
observed
the
devotion
of
the
fat
lover
the
cool
affectation
and
airs
de
grande
dame
of
the
beautiful
fiancée
it
was
amusing
to
watch
the
change
in
her
manner
already
she
had
altogether
thrown
aside
her
gentle
deference
and
fawning
amiability
and
seemed
to
go
out
of
her
way
to
seek
for
opportunities
of
covertly
sneering
at
sir
ralph
or
annoying
him
with
ingeniously
impertinent
innuendoes
and
his
real
unaffected
indifference
to
it
all
galled
her
not
a
little
can
it
be
thought
he
two
women
can
exist
so
utterly
so
radically
different
as
this
girl
and
my
marion
and
as
the
thought
passed
through
his
mind
he
glanced
at
florence
she
was
looking
at
him
with
a
strangely
mingled
expression
on
her
face
regret
remorse
even
a
shade
of
pity
seemed
to
cross
her
beautiful
features
but
for
a
moment
and
then
she
hastily
turned
aside
and
began
chattering
nonsense
to
chepstow
but
a
new
direction
had
been
given
to
mediations
does
she
look
at
me
in
that
way
he
asked
himself
has
doubtless
discovered
my
secret
can
it
be
that
after
all
she
is
possessed
of
something
in
the
shape
of
a
heart
that
is
capable
of
pitying
my
bitter
disappointment
it
is
possible
i
suppose
moralists
say
there
is
a
spark
of
good
in
the
worst
of
florence
scolded
chepstow
furiously
when
she
discovered
that
he
had
confessed
to
sir
ralph
that
the
first
anniversary
of
her
death
was
not
yet
past
henceforth
there
was
nothing
but
chepstow
morning
noun
and
night
it
seemed
to
ralph
he
never
entered
his
without
coming
upon
that
worthy
there
ensconced
he
grew
very
tired
of
it
but
finding
at
last
that
the
millionaire
never
took
offence
at
anything
came
to
treat
him
somewhat
unceremoniously
and
found
it
rather
convenient
to
shuffle
on
to
his
broad
shoulders
some
of
the
duties
so
unspeakably
irksome
to
his
unsociable
self
the
day
came
on
which
an
answer
to
his
letter
was
to
be
expected
it
passed
bringing
him
nothing
likewise
its
successors
one
two
and
three
and
ralph
began
to
be
very
miserable
he
waited
a
few
days
longer
then
thought
of
writing
again
but
to
what
purpose
why
should
a
second
letter
fare
better
than
its
predecessor
suddenly
a
new
idea
struck
him
he
was
walking
near
the
rue
thomas
at
the
time
and
acted
at
once
on
the
notion
hitherto
he
had
avoided
passing
house
he
dreaded
the
sight
of
it
and
especially
of
the
little
terrace
a
corner
of
which
was
visible
from
the
street
as
he
stood
now
at
the
door
after
ringing
the
bell
he
heard
merry
voices
above
he
stepped
back
a
little
and
looked
up
on
the
terrace
he
saw
the
figure
of
a
young
girl
about
height
playing
and
laughing
with
some
children
they
were
utter
strangers
to
him
happy
innocent
creatures
but
at
that
moment
he
felt
as
if
he
hated
them
he
was
recalled
to
himself
by
the
voice
of
mme
poulin
at
the
door
she
recognized
him
and
enquired
civilly
how
she
could
serve
him
you
happen
to
know
address
he
asked
she
leave
it
with
you
before
she
went
i
have
some
letters
of
importance
to
forward
to
yes
certainly
replied
the
brisk
old
woman
shall
have
it
at
once
it
is
mademoiselle
that
gave
it
to
me
already
have
i
sent
letters
a
little
bill
by
example
that
madam
in
her
distress
failed
to
pay
and
i
have
received
the
answer
with
an
order
for
the
money
dames
étaient
gentilles
mais
bien
gentilles
cette
pauvre
thérèse
a
bien
pleuré
leur
départ
eh
le
petit
ah
était
the
address
reminded
ralph
yes
the
address
i
go
to
seek
and
she
disappeared
in
another
moment
returning
with
two
or
three
ready
directed
and
stamped
envelopes
in
her
band
on
each
of
which
was
written
in
a
clear
girlish
george
archer
west
parade
exclaimed
ralph
jove
and
i
put
leamington
my
mistake
evidently
and
that
snake
of
a
girl
suspected
my
secret
and
encouraged
my
mistake
heaven
forgive
her
for
i
and
mme
poulin
saw
that
something
was
wrong
fears
then
that
this
address
will
not
reach
it
is
true
they
were
soon
to
depart
pour
les
indes
mais
il
faut
les
indes
interrupted
ralph
eagerly
then
both
the
ladies
going
there
the
young
lady
too
mme
poulin
looked
puzzled
oui
she
said
is
to
say
at
least
i
have
always
thought
evidently
the
contrary
had
never
occurred
to
her
but
a
bright
idea
struck
her
go
to
ask
thérèse
she
said
spoke
much
with
mademoiselle
without
doubt
mademoiselle
will
have
told
her
if
it
were
not
and
the
old
woman
disappeared
for
the
second
time
in
a
few
minutes
she
returned
bringing
her
daughter
to
assist
at
the
consultation
ralph
heard
their
voices
chattering
shrilly
along
the
passage
and
a
few
words
reached
him
indes
petite
demoiselle
non
ma
mère
assurément
and
so
on
those
few
moments
seemed
hours
to
him
opinion
to
some
extent
relieved
him
of
this
new
terror
though
on
close
she
did
not
appear
to
have
very
certain
grounds
for
her
belief
yet
the
impression
she
had
received
while
the
little
family
was
with
them
was
evidently
that
the
young
lady
was
not
going
to
india
was
not
in
fact
a
permanent
member
of
household
i
am
aware
of
said
ralph
i
want
to
know
is
did
she
ever
allude
in
any
way
to
india
or
to
her
perhaps
going
there
but
thérèse
could
not
remember
that
she
had
ever
done
so
so
with
this
negative
satisfaction
ralph
was
forced
to
be
content
and
thanking
the
mother
and
daughter
for
their
went
his
way
the
precious
envelope
in
his
hand
to
think
over
what
next
to
do
after
all
he
decided
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
write
again
this
time
of
course
to
the
right
address
the
same
objections
remained
in
full
force
against
his
going
to
england
and
trying
there
to
find
marion
for
himself
so
he
wrote
at
once
two
letters
one
to
archer
enclosing
as
before
another
to
marion
then
unfortunately
he
changed
his
mind
and
sent
them
separately
that
to
miss
freer
to
the
care
of
archer
that
to
cissy
merely
a
few
words
begging
her
at
once
to
send
him
miss
address
or
if
by
any
possibility
she
were
actually
accompanying
archer
to
india
to
let
him
know
whence
and
how
they
were
going
if
from
marseilles
he
would
start
at
a
notice
to
meet
them
there
on
their
way
this
letter
reached
cheltenham
a
few
days
after
cissy
had
left
it
lay
for
some
time
in
the
senior
house
that
lady
being
ill
or
away
from
home
and
was
then
sent
on
to
india
where
cissy
received
it
by
the
same
mail
as
another
letter
from
ralph
sent
to
india
direct
which
we
shall
hear
about
presently
the
other
letter
that
directed
to
miss
freer
never
reached
its
destination
never
at
least
as
we
have
seen
came
to
hands
its
history
was
never
known
probably
enough
it
arrived
at
house
and
some
stupid
or
officious
servant
seeing
the
unfamiliar
name
may
have
said
after
the
manner
of
her
kind
it
was
for
us
and
sent
the
poor
letter
adrift
again
chapter
ix
ralph
continued
when
his
mother
saw
she
in
her
mind
was
troubled
sore
she
wist
well
what
to
weene
she
could
by
search
nor
any
means
out
find
the
secret
cause
and
nature
of
his
teene
unto
himself
she
tame
and
him
besought
if
aught
lay
hidden
in
his
grieved
thought
it
to
reveal
who
still
her
answered

was
nought
fairy

canto
xii
by
this
time
april
was
pretty
far
advanced
suddenly
after
an
interval
of
some
temperate
weather
succeeding
the
usual
spring
rains
altes
grew
intolerably
hot
and
every
one
began
to
desert
the
poor
little
town
as
if
it
we
plague
stricken
some
weeks
previously
lady
severn
had
engaged
for
the
six
summer
a
villa
at
vevey
and
thither
she
now
decided
on
removing
herself
and
her
rather
cumbrous
household
much
to
disappointment
he
was
heartily
sick
of
living
abroad
in
this
unhomelike
fashion
and
had
been
for
long
hoping
that
the
approaching
summer
would
see
medhurst
once
more
inhabited
but
to
this
wish
of
his
his
mother
was
as
yet
unwilling
to
agree
she
still
shrank
from
returning
to
the
place
where
the
light
of
her
eyes
her
eldest
son
had
met
his
death
and
succeeded
in
persuading
herself
that
on
every
account
especially
it
was
better
for
them
all
to
remain
on
the
continent
for
another
year
so
they
left
altes
at
the
end
of
april
sufficient
time
however
had
elapsed
to
ralph
to
have
received
an
answer
to
his
second
letter
but
none
arrived
he
came
at
last
to
a
new
determination
at
all
risks
he
resolved
after
seeing
his
mother
and
her
party
safely
established
at
vevey
to
go
to
england
and
with
the
help
of
the
cheltenham
address
in
his
possession
seek
to
discover
his
lost
marion
and
learn
the
reason
of
her
strange
silence
not
having
replied
to
his
enquiries
did
not
surprise
him
he
began
to
feel
sure
that
she
must
have
set
out
on
her
long
journey
eastward
before
his
letter
had
arrived
at
her
house
the
fear
that
marion
might
have
accompanied
her
to
india
he
resolutely
determined
for
the
present
to
set
aside
time
enough
to
think
of
it
when
he
discovered
it
to
be
actually
the
case
as
would
have
it
some
considerable
time
elapsed
before
he
found
himself
free
to
turn
northwards
half
way
on
their
journey
to
switzerland
sybil
fell
ill
poor
little
he
could
not
find
it
in
his
heart
to
leave
her
even
had
he
thought
it
right
to
do
so
it
was
a
very
miserable
state
of
things
their
was
a
small
provincial
town
near
the
french
frontier
where
as
may
be
imagined
the
accommodation
was
far
from
luxurious
they
succeeded
in
securing
the
best
rooms
in
the
best
hotel
which
sounds
gorgeous
enough
but
practically
speaking
was
the
very
reverse
the
little
inn
was
built
round
a
small
courtyard
on
to
which
opened
the
windows
of
all
the
rooms
considering
that
in
this
courtyard
were
performed
all
the
unsightly
though
doubtless
unavoidable
household
duties
such
as
scouring
of
pans
washing
of
cabbages
and
killing
of
chickens
that
herein
also
took
place
all
the
gossiping
bargaining
and
scolding
of
the
neighbourhood
and
that
to
crown
all
the
weather
was
stiflingly
hot
and
cleanliness
but
a
pleasing
recollection
of
the
past
it
may
easily
be
imagined
that
it
was
hardly
the
spot
one
would
choose
to
be
ill
in
the
poor
child
suffered
terribly
her
constant
cry
was
for
ralph
in
whose
arms
at
all
hours
of
the
day
and
night
she
seemed
alone
to
find
ease
or
repose
and
for
a
whole
fortnight
they
knew
not
what
to
think
or
hope
lady
severn
was
wretched
she
too
in
her
suffering
and
anxiety
clung
closely
to
her
son
it
drew
them
very
near
time
of
dread
and
did
not
a
little
to
reveal
to
the
poor
lady
the
true
character
of
her
quondam
favourite
florence
vyse
the
beauty
as
might
have
been
expected
behaved
with
utter
heartlessness
and
selfish
disregard
of
every
comfort
but
her
own
grumbling
fretfully
whenever
she
thought
lady
severn
could
not
hear
her
at
the
hardship
of
being
detained
in
this
hole
and
all
but
saying
openly
that
if
only
they
could
get
away
from
this
place
she
cared
little
whether
the
child
lived
or
died
but
sweet
was
not
yet
to
end
she
recovered
and
as
is
the
way
with
children
once
they
the
turn
as
it
is
called
amazed
them
all
by
the
speediness
of
her
convalescence
spite
of
all
the
disadvantages
of
her
surroundings
by
the
latter
half
of
may
she
was
able
to
be
moved
and
the
end
of
the
month
saw
them
all
comfortably
established
in
the
pretty
swiss
de
then
at
last
ralph
began
to
think
of
executing
his
project
but
before
he
had
had
time
to
enter
into
any
of
its
details
the
whole
scheme
was
unexpectedly
knocked
on
the
head
the
first
morning
after
their
arrival
in
vevey
he
was
passing
along
the
principal
street
on
his
way
to
look
up
the
doctor
in
whose
care
they
had
been
advised
to
place
sybil
when
some
way
in
front
he
saw
a
familiar
figure
advancing
towards
him
an
englishwoman
evidently
as
he
could
have
told
by
her
walk
even
had
he
not
known
her
and
broadset
and
reddish
haired
coming
along
with
that
peculiar
swing
of
mingled
hauteur
and
nonchalance
affected
by
one
type
of
that
curious
genus
the
fast
young
lady
there
was
no
mistaking
our
old
acquaintance
sophy
berwick
ralph
looked
about
him
nervously
for
a
chance
of
escape
but
on
neither
side
was
there
any
he
was
not
quite
capable
of
turning
round
and
actually
running
for
it
though
he
felt
not
a
little
inclined
to
do
so
in
another
moment
she
saw
him
and
he
was
in
for
it
almost
before
she
was
within
hearing
she
began
to
speak
as
fast
as
ever
at
the
present
time
his
appearance
was
a
perfect
godsend
to
her
she
was
burdened
with
the
weight
of
a
whole
budget
of
uncommunicated
altes
gossip
you
are
here
sir
ralph
was
her
greeting
my
word
wonders
will
never
cease
the
last
person
i
expected
to
see
i
thought
you
had
gone
back
to
england
for
good
i
am
very
glad
to
see
you
though
fancy
what
a
piece
of
news
we
have
just
heard
frank
is
going
to
be
married
you
will
never
guess
who
the
lady
is
for
my
part
i
imagine
what
he
could
see
in
her
little
idiot
in
my
opinion
do
guess
now
who
it
it
was
useless
for
ralph
to
protest
his
incapacity
for
ever
guessing
anything
especially
the
present
puzzle
sophy
had
metaphorically
speaking
him
there
was
no
escape
not
miss
freer
proceeded
sophy
wish
it
were
she
had
more
sense
that
doll
dora
bailey
and
just
imagine
it
was
all
settled
before
frank
left
only
they
agreed
to
keep
it
a
secret
for
three
months
for
reasons
best
known
to
themselves
now
confess
you
surprised
knowing
all
he
did
of
frank
private
history
ralph
could
honestly
say
he
was
having
listened
to
a
few
more
comments
from
miss
sophy
on
this
subject
he
began
to
hope
he
might
be
allowed
to
pursue
his
way
but
such
was
far
from
the
young
intention
be
in
such
a
hurry
said
she
lots
more
to
tell
you
and
ask
about
is
it
true
that
your
cousin
is
going
to
marry
that
jolly
old
chepstow
that
too
i
heard
the
other
is
true
certainly
said
ralph
chepstow
and
miss
vyse
are
engaged
to
be
married
but
whoever
told
you
the
young
lady
was
my
cousin
made
a
mistake
however
that
does
not
and
about
that
pretty
archer
pursued
the
relentless
sophy
went
off
in
such
a
nurse
her
husband
was
it
not
i
heard
of
her
from
some
friends
of
mine
who
knew
her
and
were
going
out
at
the
same
time
about
the
middle
of
april
they
set
and
miss
freer
they
will
be
near
their
end
now
only
they
were
going
up
to
the
hills
i
near
simla
i
was
just
thinking
how
queer
it
would
be
if
frank
and
marion
freer
came
across
each
other
again
out
there
when
i
heard
of
his
engagement
to
that
stupid
dora
though
i
daresay
just
as
well
no
doubt
frank
was
tremendously
smitten
by
i
then
she
was
already
disposed
of
and
i
think
she
was
the
sort
of
girl
to
break
off
an
engagement
even
though
her
heart
was
not
in
it
do
you
sir
ralph
from
sheer
want
of
breath
the
girl
at
last
came
to
a
stop
all
too
soon
however
for
her
auditor
who
though
tortured
with
anxiety
to
hear
more
of
the
dreadful
things
the
thoughtless
rattle
alluded
to
so
carelessly
yet
could
not
for
a
moment
or
two
find
voice
to
utter
the
inquiry
on
his
lips
fortunately
at
this
juncture
attention
was
attracted
by
something
passing
in
the
street
when
she
turned
round
again
he
had
perfectly
recovered
himself
is
not
pleasant
standing
here
miss
berwick
he
said
am
in
no
hurry
suppose
you
allow
me
to
walk
so
far
on
your
way
with
you
and
we
can
compare
notes
about
all
our
old
all
means
replied
sophy
delighted
with
his
unusual
urbanity
which
confirmed
her
in
her
often
expressed
opinion
that
severn
only
wanted
shaking
to
be
a
good
fun
as
any
were
we
talking
about
added
she
freer
he
said
carelessly
think
so
at
least
you
were
saying
she
had
gone
out
to
india
were
you
not
i
did
not
know
she
lived
permanently
with
archer
said
sophy
altes
she
was
only
visiting
her
but
she
was
going
out
to
india
to
be
married
archer
told
me
so
herself
one
day
and
marion
was
very
angry
she
wanted
it
kept
a
secret
her
is
enormously
rich
much
older
than
she
i
believe
i
am
almost
sure
she
did
not
like
the
idea
her
manner
was
so
queer
when
it
was
referred
to
i
expect
she
had
been
forced
into
it
she
was
so
poor
you
happen
to
know
the
name
do
you
in
a
voice
that
would
have
sounded
startling
in
a
strangeness
to
any
one
less
obtuse
than
his
companion
she
said
consideringly
did
not
hear
it
archer
was
just
going
to
tell
it
me
but
marion
got
so
angry
she
stopped
she
was
to
be
married
as
soon
as
she
got
there
why
she
will
almost
be
married
another
month
any
way
it
seem
funny
she
looked
up
in
sir
face
as
she
bright
eyes
fixed
on
his
face
in
all
good
faith
and
unconcern
she
thought
she
was
speaking
the
truth
ralph
looked
at
her
and
saw
that
she
meant
what
she
said
he
accepted
it
something
in
his
glance
struck
even
sophy
as
peculiar
whispers
had
once
or
twice
reached
her
at
altes
that
he
too
the
unimpressionable
baronet
had
at
last
been
not
more
and
by
whom
of
all
people
in
the
world
but
by
that
quiet
pale
girl
the
miss
freer
who
gave
daily
lessons
to
his
nieces
it
was
very
strange
the
altes
magpies
said
to
each
other
what
there
was
about
that
girl
that
gentlemen
found
so
charming
very
strange
and
incomprehensible
above
all
that
sir
ralph
severn
who
might
marry
one
should
think
of
her
he
was
odd
certainly
but
then
there
was
his
mother
she
would
never
hear
of
such
a
thing
so
as
no
further
material
was
provided
for
the
growth
of
the
report
it
died
a
natural
death
and
was
quickly
succeeded
by
other
and
more
exciting
topics
like
a
dream
the
hints
she
had
heard
returned
to
memory
it
have
been
true
she
asked
herself
and
again
she
glanced
at
her
companion
he
was
walking
along
quietly
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
ground
in
another
moment
he
spoke
what
more
news
have
you
for
me
miss
berwick
he
said
lightly
me
see
we
have
done
a
good
deal
of
business
in
the
last
few
minutes
assisted
at
three
prospective
marriages
and
made
our
comments
thereupon
the
last
we
discussed
seems
to
me
the
least
satisfactory
that
poor
girl
miss
freer
i
pity
her
if
she
is
forced
into
a
mercenary
replied
sophy
suppose
she
is
to
be
pitied
provided
she
does
not
care
for
anyone
else
she
will
get
along
well
enough
with
her
husband
i
dare
say
particularly
if
he
is
so
rich
it
is
much
easier
to
keep
good
friends
when
there
is
plenty
of
you
think
so
said
ralph
indifferently
how
the
words
stung
him
she
cares
for
no
one
but
he
answered
so
carelessly
and
naturally
that
the
sophy
was
quite
deceived
and
dismissed
as
groundless
the
idea
that
had
occurred
to
her
they
walked
on
together
some
little
distance
ralph
skilfully
drawing
her
out
but
to
no
purpose
she
had
evidently
told
him
and
apparently
without
exaggeration
all
she
knew
on
the
subject
he
went
home
what
he
thought
and
felt
and
suffered
those
who
have
marvelled
at
themselves
for
living
through
similar
bitterness
and
disappointment
will
know
without
my
attempting
the
impossible
task
of
describing
it
those
on
the
other
hand
who
have
not
hitherto
passed
through
such
anguish
may
yet
have
to
bear
it
and
to
many
even
the
feeble
words
i
might
vainly
employ
would
appear
exaggerated
and
unnatural
the
result
of
that
meeting
with
sophy
berwick
was
the
following
letter
to
archer
containing
an
enclosure
for
miss
freer
he
wrote
both
letters
at
once
he
could
not
rest
till
he
had
done
so
though
by
the
rule
of
contrary
again
he
found
when
they
were
written
that
he
had
missed
the
mail
by
two
or
three
days
only
so
they
did
not
go
till
the
following
month
and
it
was
july
ere
cissy
received
them
additional
delay
resulting
from
their
going
round
by
the
headquarters
of
colonel
regiment
in
the
first
place
the
only
address
which
ralph
felt
confidence
in
after
his
late
disastrous
experience
this
was
what
he
wrote
to
cissy
mornier
dear
archer
this
you
may
have
received
a
letter
i
sent
to
your
cheltenham
address
trusting
it
might
reach
you
before
you
left
as
however
i
have
received
no
answer
to
it
i
suppose
it
must
have
been
too
late
it
will
therefore
probably
be
sent
after
you
it
consisted
merely
of
a
few
lines
begging
you
at
once
to
send
me
the
address
of
your
friend
miss
freer
to
whom
on
the
chance
of
her
being
there
even
had
you
left
i
wrote
at
the
same
time
to
that
letter
neither
have
i
received
any
answer
only
have
i
learned
the
she
accompanied
you
to
india
last
april
this
news
was
a
great
shock
to
me
still
greater
the
information
that
accompanied
miss
freer
went
out
to
india
the
betrothed
wife
of
a
gentleman
to
whom
she
was
to
be
married
very
shortly
after
her
arrival
the
person
who
told
me
this
mentioned
having
heard
it
directly
from
yourself
at
altes
some
months
ago
i
may
as
well
tell
you
that
my
informant
was
sophy
berwick
she
had
no
reason
for
telling
me
she
did
incidentally
nor
can
i
see
that
it
is
likely
she
was
mistaken
certain
words
and
allusions
of
own
confirm
me
in
believing
it
still
there
is
a
mere
it
may
not
be
so
and
on
this
i
now
write
to
you
begging
you
as
speedily
as
possible
to
tell
me
the
truth
at
the
time
marion
under
pressure
of
strong
excitement
let
fall
the
hints
i
refer
to
she
evidently
did
not
consider
herself
irrevocably
bound
she
alluded
to
some
concealment
concerning
herself
some
obstacle
connected
with
her
wishes
had
i
only
then
dared
to
speak
more
openly
of
my
own
hopes
and
intentions
all
might
have
been
well
but
i
thought
it
right
not
to
do
so
and
since
i
have
been
free
to
speak
a
series
of
beginning
with
your
sudden
flight
from
altes
and
ending
with
my
last
letters
missing
you
previous
ones
having
shared
the
same
fate
through
an
incorrect
address
has
i
fear
separated
ever
it
is
very
terrible
to
me
to
realise
that
it
probably
is
so
as
to
her
i
must
try
to
be
unselfish
enough
to
hope
that
all
this
may
have
fallen
more
lightly
on
her
younger
and
more
elastic
nature
i
do
not
know
if
you
ever
guessed
this
secret
of
mine
i
almost
wish
now
that
i
had
confided
it
to
you
the
enclosed
letter
contains
a
full
explanation
of
all
in
my
conduct
that
to
my
poor
darling
must
have
seemed
mysterious
and
inexplicable
if
when
you
receive
this
she
be
yet
by
any
blessed
chance
free
give
it
to
her
all
then
will
i
feel
assured
be
well
if
on
the
other
hand
as
is
more
probable
she
be
already
bound
to
another
even
perhaps
by
this
time
married
return
it
to
me
as
it
is
and
never
i
beseech
you
mention
my
name
to
her
better
far
she
should
forget
me
despise
me
even
than
that
by
learning
that
i
alas
have
not
ceased
never
can
cease
to
care
for
her
her
married
life
with
another
should
be
embittered
by
vain
regret
and
in
no
case
mind
you
do
i
blame
her
i
am
ignorant
of
the
circumstances
which
must
have
compelled
her
to
agree
to
a
marriage
into
which
she
could
not
enter
with
her
heart
whatever
they
may
have
been
she
i
am
sure
is
to
be
excused
her
youth
and
unselfishness
of
disposition
would
render
her
easy
to
persuade
to
such
a
sacrifice
i
have
said
more
than
i
intended
selfishly
too
i
have
omitted
to
express
my
hopes
that
you
found
colonel
archer
in
a
fair
way
to
complete
recovery
i
do
not
send
any
message
to
him
as
i
must
beg
you
on
every
account
to
consider
this
letter
and
all
it
contains
as
strictly
private
i
shall
be
very
grateful
to
you
if
you
will
answer
this
as
soon
as
possible
believe
me
faithfully
severn
i
am
forgetting
to
mention
that
if
the
letter
i
sent
to
cheltenham
to
miss
freer
has
with
yours
been
forwarded
to
india
it
is
not
either
way
of
much
consequence
fearing
it
might
not
reach
her
directly
i
purposely
made
it
short
and
formal
merely
expressing
my
regret
at
not
having
seen
her
again
and
asking
for
her
address
that
i
might
send
her
some
books
this
and
everything
else
is
fully
explained
in
the
was
three
times
the
length
of
the
foregoing
it
contained
as
ralph
said
a
full
explanation
of
all
that
had
occurred
since
the
last
evening
at
altes
when
they
parted
as
they
thought
for
the
fortnight
merely
of
visit
to
england
now
began
again
for
ralph
a
period
of
weary
waiting
till
the
answer
or
answers
to
his
letters
might
be
expected
it
was
a
long
time
to
months
or
thereabouts
he
grew
sick
of
the
summer
the
constant
sunshine
and
brightness
and
longed
for
the
time
when
he
should
see
the
leaves
beginning
to
turn
when
among
the
trees
he
should
perceive
the
first
whisper
of
autumn
by
then
he
thought
suspense
at
least
will
be
over
and
at
the
worst
i
shall
be
free
to
begin
to
live
down
my
so
it
came
to
pass
that
at
the
very
same
time
both
marion
and
he
were
waiting
with
anxious
hearts
for
news
from
the
east
whereas
had
they
only
known
it
but
a
few
journey
and
a
few
words
of
explanation
would
have
sufficed
again
and
for
life
to
unite
them
what
for
two
or
three
weeks
ralph
thought
was
to
be
his
only
answer
came
to
him
as
to
marion
in
the
advertisement
sheet
of
the
where
one
morning
early
in
october
he
saw
the
announcement
of
poor
death
it
shocked
him
greatly
for
a
week
or
two
he
knew
not
what
to
think
or
do
then
one
morning
as
he
was
all
but
losing
hope
of
any
further
or
more
satisfactory
reply
he
received
an
indian
letter
a
bulky
letter
with
a
deep
black
border
round
the
envelope
and
addressed
in
an
unfamiliar
hand
he
turned
it
about
as
people
always
do
when
particularly
anxious
to
learn
the
contents
of
a
letter
stared
at
the
address
the
stamps
and
the
black
seal
as
if
they
could
reveal
the
secret
of
the
inside
at
last
he
opened
it
and
drew
out
a
second
envelope
likewise
addressed
to
himself
but
in
a
different
hand
and
with
no
black
edge
this
again
he
opened
and
out
fell
on
to
the
floor
at
his
feet
a
letter
that
was
no
stranger
to
him
his
own
letter
to
miss
freer
somewhat
crushed
and
from
its
much
travelling
but
otherwise
exactly
as
it
had
left
him
the
seal
unbroken
the
whole
evidently
untampered
with
and
his
own
words
to
cissy
recurred
to
him
on
the
other
hand
she
be
already
bound
to
another
even
perhaps
by
this
time
married
return
it
to
me
as
it
is
and
never
i
beseech
you
mention
my
name
to
her
he
understood
it
poor
cissy
had
obeyed
him
and
no
fear
that
now
she
would
betray
his
confidence
but
looking
again
at
the
outside
envelope
he
saw
that
it
still
contained
something
a
short
letter
only
written
almost
immediately
after
his
death
by
george
archer
whose
was
the
writing
which
ralph
not
having
seen
for
many
years
had
failed
to
recognize
it
ran
thus
provinces
dear
severn
you
may
have
chanced
to
hear
of
my
great
loss
considering
all
the
aggravations
our
long
separation
her
hastening
out
to
nurse
me
at
risk
to
herself
my
inexcusable
selfishness
in
having
suggesting
it
i
think
you
will
not
despise
me
for
confessing
to
you
that
i
am
perfectly
prostrated
utterly
even
though
yet
at
times
unable
to
realize
it
one
of
her
last
requests
to
me
was
that
i
would
without
delay
forward
to
you
a
letter
which
would
find
in
her
she
said
and
to
be
she
was
very
ill
at
the
time
and
must
have
been
confused
in
what
she
said
for
the
enclosed
i
found
as
i
send
it
all
ready
save
the
stamps
to
be
posted
i
need
hardly
tell
you
that
i
am
in
entire
ignorance
of
it
contents
and
perfectly
satisfied
to
remain
so
always
my
poor
child
told
me
it
related
to
some
private
matters
of
your
own
as
to
which
you
had
consulted
her
she
was
evidently
anxious
about
the
matter
so
whatever
it
be
i
trust
it
may
end
well
you
will
forgive
my
not
writing
more
just
now
remember
me
to
lady
severn
and
thank
her
for
the
kindness
she
showed
to
my
wife
and
child
last
winter
most
truly
that
was
all
ralph
folded
the
letters
his
own
to
miss
fryer
he
destroyed
so
he
said
to
himself
story
is
he
wrote
at
once
to
sir
archibald
declining
the
appointment
at
which
till
now
his
old
chief
had
with
some
trouble
kept
open
for
him
he
remained
at
the
château
mornier
with
his
mother
till
in
the
autumn
she
left
it
for
a
more
genial
climate
and
one
day
soon
after
receiving
colonel
letter
he
read
in
the
newspaper
of
the
death
of
the
and
distinguished
member
for
hartford
vere
and
bestowed
a
passing
pity
on
the
scantily
provided
for
orphan
children
of
the
great
man
the
severns
did
not
winter
at
altes
that
was
spared
him
he
persuaded
his
mother
to
try
italy
for
a
change
yet
more
he
obtained
from
her
a
promise
that
should
all
be
well
the
following
spring
should
see
the
family
at
medhurst
once
there
he
felt
he
should
be
more
free
to
leave
them
and
travel
by
himself
where
the
fancy
seized
him
or
rather
wherever
he
saw
the
most
encouraging
prospect
for
the
furtherance
of
the
special
studies
which
he
was
now
determined
to
resume
in
earnest
and
in
which
he
hoped
to
find
sufficient
interest
to
prevent
his
life
from
becoming
altogether
a
blank
his
mother
was
ready
enough
to
agree
to
his
wishes
even
when
possible
to
forestall
them
since
illness
at
lusac
there
had
been
a
great
change
in
lady
severn
she
had
learned
to
cling
much
to
her
hitherto
little
valued
son
and
something
had
reached
her
in
some
subtle
impalpable
way
of
the
sorrow
of
the
bitterness
of
disappointment
through
which
this
summer
had
seen
him
pass
she
knew
no
particulars
her
private
suspicions
even
were
wide
of
the
mark
but
she
could
see
that
he
had
aged
strangely
of
late
always
grave
he
had
grown
more
so
and
it
was
long
since
any
of
the
bright
sudden
flashes
of
humour
had
been
heard
which
of
old
relieved
by
their
sparkle
his
usual
quiet
seriousness
something
of
her
anxiety
about
him
she
one
day
endeavoured
to
express
to
him
but
she
never
tried
it
again
with
perfect
gentleness
but
irresistible
firmness
he
put
her
aside
and
in
her
inmost
heart
she
felt
she
deserved
it
he
could
forgive
even
in
a
sense
forget
but
as
to
taking
into
his
confidence
accepting
the
sympathy
of
the
mother
whose
previous
indifference
prejudice
and
love
of
power
had
greatly
been
to
blame
for
the
great
sorrow
of
his
was
asking
too
much
still
though
too
late
for
confidence
there
was
perfect
peace
between
mother
and
son
undisturbed
even
by
the
continued
presence
of
through
the
winter
of
florence
vyse
who
had
taken
it
into
her
head
that
the
éclat
of
her
marriage
would
be
much
increased
by
medhurst
being
the
scene
of
the
interesting
ceremony
in
consequence
of
which
the
ardent
chepstow
had
to
agree
to
its
being
deferred
till
the
spring
florence
found
it
rather
good
fun
being
she
kept
her
stout
admirer
trotting
backwards
and
forwards
between
england
and
italy
all
the
winter
which
was
rather
a
profitable
arrangement
so
far
as
she
was
concerned
as
on
each
occasion
of
arrival
and
departure
she
was
presented
with
a
new
and
gorgeous
of
the
absent
chepstow
or
token
of
his
remembrance
of
her
when
in
distant
lands
his
devotion
was
really
touching
as
maids
say
and
paid
well
too
for
long
before
she
became
chepstow
the
beauty
had
accumulated
a
very
fair
show
of
jewellery
and
feminine
treasures
not
a
few
of
which
in
justice
to
her
be
it
recorded
found
their
way
to
the
humble
little
house
standing
in
a
row
in
one
of
the
northern
suburbs
of

dwelt
the

on
whom
what
she
possessed
of
a
heart
was
bestowed
she
was
more
genuinely
amiable

this
winter
than
she
had
yet
shown
herself
to
ralph

her
manner

become
gentle
almost

prosperity

she
could
afford
now
that
the

of
her
jealous
irritation
was
removed
almost
to

the
man
in
every
respect
so
immeasurably

happiness
she

spitefulness

with

late
all
communication
between
sir
ralph
and
the
girl
who
she
fancied
had
usurped
her
place
with
him
yet
now
when
she
looked
at
him
sometimes
and
despite
all
his
proud
and
impenetrable
reserve
descried
symptoms
of
a
grief
it
was
not

when
all

smiling
on

she
had
begun
to

herself
decidedly
better
off

she
would
have
been

incomprehensible

were
moments
in

two

three

through

cheerless
dreary
months
at
the

house
excepting
always
the
occasional
breaks
in
the
cloudy
monotony
of
her
life
contrived
for
her
by
the
watchful
thoughtfulness
of
geoffrey
baldwin
not
the

of
these
had
been
the
pleasure
of
company
during
the
christmas
holidays
the
last
in

probability
the
young
man
would
spend
in
england
for
years
to
come
for
which
geoffrey
alone
was
to
be
thanked
miss
tremlett
would
have
fainted
at
the
bare
idea
of
having
that
as
even
a
few
guest
she
him
however
handsomely
with
which
proof
of
her
affection
harry
was
amply
content
finding
his
quarters
at
the
manor
farm
infinitely
more
to
his
taste
than
a
residence
in
the
cross
house
though
two
miles
distant
he
managed
to
see
a
great
deal
of
his
sister
his
host
being
no
unwilling
coadjutor
in
this
respect
they
had
plenty
of
rides
together
to
which
this
open
winter
in
other
respects
so
disagreeable
was
favourable
and
at
times
when
braced
by
the
fresh
air
and
exhilarated
by
the
exercise
marion
for
a
brief
space
felt
almost
happy
but
only
for
a
brief
space
her
life
was
very
repulsive
to
her
and
although
she
made
the
best
of
it
to
harry
he
saw
enough
to
make
him
feel
for
her
greatly
nor
did
his
pity
end
with
the
sentiment
in
all
seriousness
the
brother
offered
rather
than
condemn
her
to
such
an
existence
to
give
up
his
cherished
and
chosen
intention
of
entering
the
army
for
which
by
this
time
he
was
fully
prepared
and
remain
near
her
with
the
hopes
of
in
time
being
able
to
set
up
a
modest
little
establishment
of
their
own
he
would
try
for
a
clerkship
in
the
mallingford
bank
or
take
to
farming
under
geoffrey
guidance
to
neither
of
which
proposals
however
would
marion
hear
of
consenting
think
so
poorly
of
me
harry
as
to
imagine
that
my
life
would
be
any
the
happier
for
knowing
i
had
been
the
means
of
spoiling
yours
though
i
love
you
for
offering
this
and
i
will
try
to
be
incited
by
the
remembrance
of
it
to
more
her
one
the
gentle
but
veronica
warmly
applauded
her
unselfish
resolution
so
in
his
heart
for
more
reasons
than
one
did
geoffrey
baldwin
though
he
said
nothing
with
a
face
smiling
through
its
tears
the
poor
girl
bid
her
brother
farewell
to
midsummer
you
know
may
said
the
boy
regiment
i
may
get
my
commission
in
sure
of
some
weeks
at
home
first
to
say
with
baldwin
he
added
for
alas
was
a
mere
memory
of
the
past
to
the
two
orphans
is
so
very
kind
may
i
really
know
how
we
are
ever
to
thank
him
for
is
indeed
said
marion
warmly
so
warmly
that
harry
who
had
but
small
experience
of
that
queer
thing
a
heart
smiled
to
himself
and
want
away
considerably
happier
in
mind
about
his
sister
for
this
corroboration
as
he
thought
it
of
a
very
pleasant
suspicion
which
had
lately
entered
his
imagination
would
suit
so
capitally
he
thought
to
himself
every
way
a
thorough
good
fellow
not
so
clever
as
may
certainly
but
get
on
just
as
well
for
all
perhaps
so
harry
it
is
a
question
and
a
not
easily
answered
one
as
to
how
far
congeniality
of
mind
is
necessary
to
a
happy
marriage
but
certainly
to
give
two
such
different
natures
as
those
of
geoffrey
baldwin
and
marion
vere
a
chance
of
assimilating
in
the
long
run
one
element
is
indispensable
a
good
foundation
of
mutual
love
not
friendship
however
sincere
not
esteem
however
which
the
former
are
but
a
part
not
necessarily
even
that
say
some
from
whom
nevertheless
i
differ
in
opinion
after
harry
had
gone
it
was
the
old
monotonous
story
again
it
was
impossible
for
her
to
ride
so
much
as
while
her
brother
was
with
them
for
the
copley
girls
were
not
always
to
be
got
hold
of
and
baldwin
as
marion
observed
with
some
surprise
rather
fought
shy
of
excursions
would
have
thought
he
was
so
prudish
she
said
to
herself
rather
misplaced
for
sure
everybody
knows
he
is
just
like
a
sort
of
uncle
or
brother
to
however
in
brentshire
is
not
in
the
habit
of
thinking
anything
so
natural
and
innocent
and
geoffrey
was
wise
in
his
generation
though
in
this
instance
really
the
grundys
of
the
neighbourhood
might
have
been
excused
for
remarking
the
very
palpable
and
undeniable
fact
that
baldwin
was
a
remarkably
handsome
bachelor
of
only
seven
or
eight
and
twenty
and
miss
vere
pretty
pale
of
little
more
than
nineteen
sort
of
girl
too
that
manages
to
get
herself
admired
by
gentlemen
though
why
i
really
see
remarked
one
of
the
to
her
confidante
for
the
time
who
in
reply
observed
that
more
could
adding
moreover
that
knows
what
that
sort
of
affair
is
sure
to
end
in
young
guardian
and
interesting
ward
the
girl
knew
well
enough
what
she
was
about
evidently
she
had
not
taken
up
her
quarters
with
that
odious
miss
tremlett
for
nothing
had
her
father
lived
or
left
her
better
off
she
might
have
looked
higher
but
as
things
were
she
had
done
wisely
not
to
quarrel
with
her
visits
to
miss
temple
though
by
reason
of
her
unreasonable
prejudice
they
had
to
be
managed
with
extreme
discretion
and
not
made
too
frequently
were
at
this
time
of
great
benefit
to
the
girl
the
influence
of
the
thoroughly
sound
and
sweet
veronica
softened
while
it
strengthened
her
and
did
much
to
weaken
if
not
altogether
eradicate
a
certain
root
of
bitterness
which
not
unnaturally
began
to
show
itself
in
her
disposition
she
was
not
given
to
bosom
friendships
or
confidantes
though
frank
and
ingenuous
she
had
like
all
strong
natures
a
great
power
of
reserve
even
to
cissy
archer
the
most
intimate
friend
she
had
ever
had
she
by
no
means
as
we
have
seen
thought
it
necessary
to
confide
all
her
innermost
feelings
through
the
circumstances
of
her
life
and
education
her
principle
acquaintances
not
to
say
friends
had
been
of
the
opposite
to
tell
the
truth
she
preferred
that
they
should
be
from
no
unwomanliness
in
herself
from
no
shadow
of
approach
to
had
she
come
to
like
the
society
of
men
more
than
that
of
women
rather
i
think
from
the
very
opposite
extreme
though
veiled
timidity
and
which
instinctively
turned
to
the
larger
and
more
generous
nature
for
encouragement
and
shelter
it
never
cost
her
a
shrinking
or
hesitation
to
preside
at
one
of
her
dinner
parties
where
the
sight
of
her
bright
interested
face
and
the
sound
of
her
sweet
eager
voice
were
a
pleasant
refreshment
to
the
overworked
men
who
surrounded
the
table
yet
in
a
or
worse
still
in
a
laughing
chattering
party
of
fashionable
girls
marion
though
to
outward
appearance
perfectly
at
little
graver
and
quieter
perhaps
than
her
heart
was
shy
and
to
a
painful
degree
after
all
however
it
is
well
for
a
woman
to
have
one
or
more
good
friends
of
her
own
sex
and
this
marion
acknowledged
to
herself
as
she
came
to
know
more
intimately
how
true
and
beautiful
a
nature
was
contained
in
the
poor
and
crippled
form
of
the
invalid
veronica
was
i
daresay
an
exceptional
character
not
so
much
as
to
her
patience
and
cheerful
to
the
honour
of
our
nature
be
it
said
are
no
rare
qualities
among
the
of
all
in
respect
of
her
wonderful
unselfishness
power
of
going
out
of
and
beyond
herself
to
sympathise
in
the
joy
as
well
as
the
sorrow
of
others
and
her
unusual
a
better
or
healthier
friend
marion
vere
could
not
have
met
with
that
some
personal
sorrow
something
much
nearer
to
her
than
the
death
of
her
father
or
the
losses
it
entailed
had
clouded
the
life
of
her
young
friend
veronica
was
not
slow
to
discover
but
she
did
not
press
for
a
confidence
which
it
was
evidently
foreign
to
the
feelings
to
bestow
she
only
did
in
her
quiet
way
what
little
she
could
insensibly
almost
towards
assisting
marion
to
turn
to
the
best
account
in
her
life
training
this
and
all
other
experiences
that
had
befallen
her
how
different
from
geoffrey
ever
so
long
ago
he
honest
fellow
had
poured
out
all
his
story
to
the
friend
who
had
for
many
years
stood
him
in
place
of
both
mother
and
sister
and
by
her
advice
he
had
acted
in
refraining
from
risking
all
by
a
premature
avowal
to
marion
of
his
manly
love
and
devotion
veronica
poor
soul
was
sorely
exercised
in
spirit
about
these
two
she
loved
them
both
so
much
and
yet
she
could
not
but
see
how
utterly
radically
unlike
they
were
to
each
other
geoffrey
some
few
years
her
junior
had
from
infancy
seemed
like
a
younger
brother
of
her
own
and
since
her
illness
in
particular
the
gentle
kindness
the
attention
he
had
shown
her
had
endeared
him
to
her
greatly
what
on
his
side
of
his
real
manliness
his
simple
love
of
the
good
and
pure
and
hatred
of
the
wrong
he
owed
to
this
poor
crippled
woman
is
one
of
the
things
that
little
suspected
now
shall
one
day
be
fully
seen
yet
for
all
this
for
all
her
love
for
and
pride
in
him
veronica
made
no
hero
of
the
young
man
she
saw
plainly
that
in
all
but
his
simple
goodness
he
was
inferior
to
marion
and
seeing
this
and
coming
to
love
the
girl
and
admire
her
many
gifts
as
she
did
poor
veronica
as
i
have
said
was
sorely
perplexed
she
temporized
in
the
first
place
till
she
saw
that
it
was
absolutely
necessary
to
do
so
she
had
not
the
heart
to
crush
poor
hopes
she
said
to
him
yet
awhile
she
has
had
much
to
try
her
of
late
and
there
is
no
time
lost
think
how
young
she
is
if
you
startled
her
you
might
ruin
all
wait
at
least
till
the
so
geoffrey
bit
the
end
of
his
rather
ruefully
thanked
miss
veronica
and
much
against
his
may
be
thought
veronica
this
is
to
be
one
of
those
unequal
marriages
that
after
all
turn
out
quite
as
happily
or
more
so
than
those
where
the
balance
is
more
even
marion
as
yet
is
hardly
conscious
of
her
own
powers
should
she
marry
geoffrey
the
probability
is
she
will
never
become
so
never
at
least
in
the
present
state
of
things
and
after
all
much
power
is
doomed
for
ever
in
this
world
to
remain
latent
but
on
the
other
wish
it
could
be
i
do
indeed
wish
it
so
much
that
i
doubt
my
own
she
will
assuredly
be
well
able
to
decide
for
herself
when
the
question
comes
before
her
as
i
suppose
in
time
it
must
it
is
geoffrey
i
am
so
troubled
about
should
i
do
better
to
crush
his
hopes
altogether
i
could
do
so
but
then
again
if
it
should
turn
out
unnecessary
ah
no
all
i
can
do
is
to
watch
and
wait
if
only
he
does
not
ruin
his
own
cause
by
anything
only
but
alas
there
came
a
day
on
which
riding
back
to
mallingford
geoffrey
seeing
marion
home
after
parting
with
the
misses
copley
at
the
gate
a
their
park
the
following
conversation
took
place
it
was
late
in
february
a
rank
dank
chilly
afternoon
such
as
there
had
been
plenty
of
this
winter
foggy
too
daylight
already
growing
dim
an
hour
or
more
before
it
had
any
right
to
do
so
marion
shivered
though
not
altogether
from
the
cold
it
a
horrible
day
baldwin
she
asked
perfectly
wretched
day
enough
to
make
one
wonder
that
people
can
be
found
willing
to
stay
in
such
an
ugly
disagreeable
world
and
yet
something
fascinating
about
it
too
i
wonder
how
that
is
let
me
see
what
is
it
it
reminds
me
of
oh
i
know
that
song
of
spirit
haunts
the
last
hours
it
begins
very
heart
faints
and
my
whole
soul
grieves
at
the
moist
rich
smell
of
the
rotting
leaves
and
the
breath
of
the
fading
edges
of
box
the
sort
of
smell
there
is
though
so
chilly
though
that
song
is
for
the
autumn
but
more
like
autumn
than
spring
just
now
it
baldwin
there
the
slightest
feeling
of
spring
anywhere
no
freshness
no
life
everything
seems
to
be
know
said
geoffrey
doubtfully
sniffing
the
air
as
he
spoke
looking
bad
on
the
whole
see
it
will
all
take
a
start
soon
once
the
sprouts
get
their
heads
above
ground
and
then
just
think
what
a
hunting
season
had
i
declare
my
horses
had
so
much
taken
out
of
them
for
i
know
the
said
marion
half
amused
at
her
way
of
putting
things
you
i
daresay
it
has
seemed
a
very
bright
winter
and
a
cheerful
promising
spring
after
all
i
believe
the
seasons
are
as
much
in
us
as
outside
us
long
ago
i
remember
days
on
which
i
was
so
happy
that
looking
back
i
fancy
they
were
in
the
very
brightest
and
loveliest
of
the
summer
though
in
reality
they
were
in
dreary
it
is
like
time
which
seems
so
short
when
we
are
happy
so
terribly
we
are
in
sorrow
and
yet
in
reality
it
is
always
the
same
i
wonder
what
is
reality
sometimes
i
think
there
is
no
outside
at
having
arrived
at
which
satisfactory
explanation
of
the
mystery
of
the
sensible
world
marion
remembered
her
companion
long
ago
left
behind
her
having
as
he
would
have
phrased
it
had
he
been
in
the
habit
of
defining
him
situations
to
grief
at
the
very
first
fence
on
leaving
the
wish
i
so
stupid
he
thought
to
himself
wonder
if
all
girls
say
the
same
queer
puzzling
pretty
sort
of
things
she
not
that
marion
favoured
many
people
with
all
the
fanciful
dreamy
good
deal
of
it
great
nonsense
but
not
commonplace
as
she
said
it
for
all
that
which
patient
geoffrey
was
honoured
but
she
had
got
into
the
way
of
saying
to
him
came
into
her
head
not
troubling
herself
as
to
whether
he
understood
it
or
not
rather
a
way
of
treating
him
but
as
he
was
far
from
resenting
it
there
is
no
occasion
for
us
to
fight
his
battles
to
the
last
observation
he
made
no
reply
for
some
minutes
they
rode
along
the
lane
in
silence
the
horses
apparently
somewhat
depressed
in
spirit
not
being
like
miss
vere
dubious
of
the
reality
of
an
outside
world
and
a
very
foggy
and
disagreeable
one
to
boot
their
feet
sank
with
each
step
into
the
soft
yielding
mud
in
great
measure
composed
of
the
all
but
unrecognizable
remains
of
last
leaves
not
yet
buried
decently
out
of
sight
as
should
have
been
done
by
this
time
nature
was
in
a
lazy
mood
that
year
there
was
no
sound
except
the
thud
a
ruddy
slushy
sound
of
the
tired
slow
jogtrot
steps
suddenly
marion
spoke
again
this
time
in
a
different
tone
with
something
of
appeal
something
of
deprecation
she
turned
to
her
companion
baldwin
she
said
shyly
said
just
now
it
was
almost
spring
you
remember
promising
me
that
by
the
spring
you
would
try
to
do
something
for
me
miss
vere
said
geoffrey
rather
shortly
he
knew
what
was
coming
he
had
a
presentiment
he
was
going
to
be
sorely
tried
between
the
promptings
of
his
heart
and
the
sound
advice
of
his
friend
veronica
to
which
in
his
inmost
mind
he
subscribed
as
wise
and
expedient
so
he
answered
coldly
and
hated
himself
for
so
doing
while
his
heart
was
already
throbbing
considerably
faster
than
usual
be
vexed
with
me
she
said
have
not
spoken
of
it
for
ever
so
long
you
remember
i
am
sure
you
do
it
was
about
trying
to
arrange
for
me
to
live
somewhere
else
than
with
aunt
tremlett
could
i
not
go
somewhere
as
a
sort
of
boarder
perhaps
i
am
sure
i
should
not
be
difficult
to
please
if
they
were
quiet
kind
sort
of
people
and
if
i
could
have
a
couple
of
rooms
and
be
more
independent
than
i
am
now
the
worst
of
living
at
the
cross
house
is
that
i
am
never
free
except
when
my
aunt
is
asleep
she
is
always
sending
for
me
or
wanting
me
to
do
something
or
other
for
her
and
yet
with
it
all
i
never
can
please
her
have
you
no
friends
baldwin
who
would
be
willing
to
let
me
live
with
them
as
a
sort
of
boarder
you
see
i
am
quiet
and
different
from
other
girls
i
care
very
little
for
gaiety
of
any
kind
and
i
feel
so
much
older
than
i
geoffrey
rode
on
in
perfect
silence
his
head
turned
away
from
marion
as
she
made
this
rather
long
speech
all
in
the
same
tone
half
of
appeal
and
half
of
deprecation
at
last
she
grew
surprised
at
his
not
replying
and
spoke
again
answer
me
baldwin
if
you
are
vexed
with
me
and
think
me
troublesome
and
unreasonable
please
say
so
only
i
am
so
miserable
at
the
cross
house
and
you
are
the
only
person
i
can
ask
to
help
the
last
words
sounded
broken
and
quivering
as
if
the
poor
little
contemplation
of
her
own
desolate
condition
was
too
much
for
her
geoffrey
turned
round
suddenly
his
fair
face
flushed
with
the
depth
of
his
emotion
his
voice
sounding
hoarse
and
yet
clear
from
very
earnestness
he
laid
his
hand
on
the
crutch
of
saddle
and
leaned
forward
so
as
to
face
her
almost
as
he
spoke
you
say
you
are
at
the
cross
house
possibly
you
will
forgive
me
if
hearing
this
compels
me
to
lay
before
you
the
only
alternative
i
have
to
offer
you
i
had
not
meant
to
speak
of
this
so
soon
but
you
have
tried
me
too
far
i
can
not
be
silent
when
i
hear
you
speak
of
being
miserable
marion
there
is
one
home
open
to
you
whose
owner
would
gladly
spend
himself
his
whole
life
and
long
to
make
you
happy
i
know
i
am
not
good
enough
for
you
i
know
in
every
sense
i
am
unworthy
of
you
only
i
love
you
so
deeply
so
truly
surely
i
could
make
you
happy
oh
marion
what
can
i
say
to
convince
you
of
my
earnestness
for
answer
hastily
you
think
you
could
be
happy
as
my
at
least
than
you
are
till
he
left
off
speaking
marion
felt
too
utterly
amazed
and
as
it
attempt
to
interrupt
him
but
when
his
voice
ceased
she
came
to
himself
in
a
sense
at
least
not
to
her
best
self
by
any
means
for
there
was
ungentle
haste
in
the
movement
with
which
she
pushed
away
poor
hand
and
a
tone
of
extreme
irritation
petulance
almost
in
her
voice
as
she
replied
to
his
little
expected
proposition
can
you
be
so
foolish
baldwin
so
very
foolish
as
to
talk
to
me
in
that
way
are
you
really
so
blind
as
not
to
see
that
to
you
are
more
like
another
harry
of
that
sort
oh
what
a
pity
you
have
done
this
to
me
the
only
friend
i
had
and
now
you
have
put
a
stop
to
it
all
i
can
never
again
feel
comfortable
with
you
you
have
spoilt
it
all
it
is
very
very
unkind
of
you
and
she
ended
her
strange
incoherent
speech
by
bursting
into
tears
poor
geoffrey
already
its
soon
as
the
words
were
uttered
aware
of
his
egregious
mistake
and
penitent
to
the
last
degree
forthwith
set
himself
down
as
a
monster
of
inconsiderateness
and
cruelty
her
tears
altogether
for
the
moment
put
out
of
sight
his
own
exceeding
disappointment
hee
only
thought
how
best
to
console
her
miss
vere
he
said
me
it
indeed
inexcusable
of
me
to
have
so
startled
and
distressed
you
i
had
no
right
so
to
take
advantage
of
my
position
with
you
i
am
a
rough
boor
i
know
but
i
entreat
you
to
forgive
me
and
forget
all
this
as
time
you
never
get
accustomed
to
the
idea
must
i
never
again
allude
to
this
i
would
if
you
wished
it
but
never
and
his
voice
which
he
had
striven
to
make
gentle
and
calm
grew
hoarse
again
in
spite
of
his
efforts
he
was
not
of
the
order
of
suitors
you
see
who
think
a
in
the
first
place
far
from
discouraging
for
though
by
no
means
he
was
far
too
chivalrous
to
persist
and
too
genuinely
not
to
be
easily
repulsed
baldwin
said
marion
decisively
and
remorselessly
with
but
to
tell
the
truth
little
thought
for
the
time
of
the
suffering
her
words
were
inflicting
on
an
honest
manly
heart
she
was
not
her
best
self
just
then
trouble
and
weary
suspense
had
made
her
querulous
sometimes
and
temporarily
developed
in
her
the
selfishness
which
alter
all
is
to
some
extent
inherent
in
the
best
of
us
she
repeated
could
you
have
mistaken
me
so
you
see
that
i
mean
what
i
say
about
being
different
from
other
girls
all
that
sort
of
thing
is
done
with
for
me
altogether
and
entirely
so
please
understand
baldwin
that
what
you
were
speaking
of
can
never
so
then
sort
of
as
you
call
it
miss
vere
is
likewise
altogether
and
entirely
over
for
me
said
geoffrey
with
for
the
first
time
a
shade
of
bitterness
in
his
voice
will
not
punish
me
for
my
wretched
presumption
by
withdrawing
from
me
the
amount
of
friendship
or
regard
with
which
you
have
hitherto
honoured
me
it
would
complicate
our
relations
most
uncomfortably
were
you
to
do
so
for
unfortunately
we
have
no
choice
as
to
remaining
in
the
position
of
ward
and
guardian
you
forgive
me
miss
vere
and
forget
it
and
think
of
me
again
as
a
sort
of
second
harry
some
before
may
choose
another
guardian
for
yourself
but
till
then
till
the
day
when
that
fortunate
person
takes
out
or
my
hands
the
very
little
i
can
do
for
you
will
you
not
try
to
feel
towards
me
as
you
did
before
i
so
deplorably
forgot
myself
day
you
speak
of
will
never
come
said
marion
and
the
words
notwithstanding
his
soreness
of
heart
fell
pleasantly
on
ears
tell
you
i
am
not
like
other
girls
i
am
like
an
old
woman
and
my
heart
if
not
dead
is
dying
there
now
i
have
told
you
more
than
i
ever
told
anyone
i
will
try
to
forget
that
you
were
so
silly
some
day
you
will
find
some
one
far
nicer
than
i
to
make
you
happy
and
i
shall
be
great
friends
with
her
so
let
us
forget
all
this
now
by
this
time
they
were
nearly
at
the
cross
think
me
geoffrey
smiled
himself
to
do
he
parted
from
her
something
in
the
smile
sent
a
little
pang
through
the
heart
for
it
was
after
all
a
very
tender
one
i
been
unkind
she
asked
herself
there
more
depth
in
him
than
i
have
given
him
credit
for
can
he
really
be
feeling
this
very
much
and
the
misgiving
did
her
good
recalled
her
a
little
from
the
in
which
at
this
season
it
appeared
as
if
her
nature
were
about
to
be
swamped
she
could
not
help
thinking
a
good
deal
about
geoffrey
that
evening
as
she
sat
with
her
aunt
busy
in
repairing
for
that
lady
some
fine
old
lace
miss
tremlett
having
discovered
that
the
young
eyes
and
neat
hands
were
skilful
at
such
work
it
was
a
very
tiresome
occupation
and
her
head
ached
long
before
the
task
was
completed
but
she
had
leisure
to
think
while
she
worked
a
luxury
she
had
learnt
to
esteem
highly
of
late
for
miss
tremlett
was
engrossed
this
evening
with
a
new
and
most
interesting
fresh
from
the
circulating
library
behind
the
post
office
and
while
the
elder
lady
was
absorbed
by
the
loves
and
adventures
of
imaginary
heroes
and
heroines
the
younger
one
was
picturing
to
herself
for
the
thousandth
time
the
happiness
that
might
have
been
hers
but
for
the
mysterious
obstacles
that
had
intervened
from
time
to
time
too
thinking
sadly
of
the
new
cloud
that
had
overshadowed
her
life
in
the
bitter
disappointment
she
on
her
side
had
been
the
means
of
inflicting
on
another
the
reflection
took
her
a
little
out
of
herself
her
cry
this
evening
was
not
merely
as
it
had
been
for
long
marion
it
contained
also
a
more
unselfish
refrain
geoffrey
she
said
to
herself
can
not
forgive
myself
for
having
made
him
unhappy
as
unhappy
perhaps
as
strange
cruel
silence
has
made
some
days
passed
without
anything
being
seen
or
heard
of
baldwin
at
the
cross
house
marion
began
to
wonder
if
really
their
pleasant
friendship
was
to
be
at
an
end
and
to
reproach
herself
not
a
little
not
for
what
she
had
that
she
not
the
shadow
of
a
for
the
way
in
which
she
had
done
it
these
days
geoffrey
spent
at
home
in
no
very
happy
state
of
mind
he
was
furious
not
with
marion
with
himself
for
his
own
suicidal
haste
which
truly
as
veronica
had
warned
him
had
he
was
more
thoroughly
miserable
than
one
could
have
believed
possible
for
so
sunny
a
nature
he
dared
not
even
go
with
the
burden
of
his
woes
and
misdeeds
to
his
sympathising
friend
and
adviser
for
would
she
not
truly
be
more
than
human
did
she
not
turn
upon
him
with
the
cry
more
exasperating
to
bear
than
were
to
the
the
many
words
of
his
three
friends
the
reproach
we
are
all
so
ready
to
utter
so
unwilling
to
told
you
but
in
some
respects
miss
veronica
was
more
than
human
and
when
geoffrey
at
last
mustered
sufficient
courage
to
make
his
grievous
confession
she
instead
of
irritating
or
depressing
him
further
by
undeniably
truthful
but
nevertheless
useless
reproaches
set
to
work
like
a
sensible
woman
as
he
was
to
help
the
poor
fellow
to
make
the
best
of
the
affair
he
had
so
greatly
mismanaged
possibly
in
her
inmost
heart
she
was
not
sorry
to
be
relieved
to
some
extent
of
the
responsibility
she
had
found
so
weighty
for
though
most
earnest
in
her
anxiety
for
success
she
yet
as
i
have
said
felt
uncertain
as
to
the
precise
extent
to
which
she
was
called
upon
to
work
for
it
he
told
her
the
whole
story
for
he
was
not
given
to
half
confidences
what
he
had
said
and
how
marion
had
answered
in
the
replies
veronica
discerned
something
deeper
geoffrey
had
discovered
they
told
of
more
than
mere
disinclination
to
think
of
her
young
guardian
in
any
more
tender
relation
girls
of
nineteen
do
not
speak
so
bitterly
as
marion
had
spoken
to
geoffrey
unless
they
have
had
or
fancied
they
have
had
some
very
disappointing
heart
trying
experience
reverse
side
of
the
picture
of
sort
of
thing
as
miss
vere
called
it
these
suspicions
however
were
not
new
to
miss
temple
and
she
wisely
kept
them
to
herself
she
confined
her
advice
to
geoffrey
to
impressing
upon
him
the
extreme
expediency
of
not
allowing
this
unfortunate
disclosure
of
his
to
make
any
difference
in
the
relations
hitherto
existing
between
his
ward
and
himself
is
not
only
expedient
she
said
is
most
distinctly
your
duty
to
let
the
poor
child
see
that
you
were
most
thoroughly
in
earnest
when
you
asked
her
as
you
did
to
forget
all
this
and
think
of
you
again
a
sort
of
another
think
only
of
her
very
desolate
position
save
for
you
and
her
young
brother
actually
friendless
in
the
world
you
geoffrey
of
all
men
are
the
last
to
wish
another
to
suffer
for
your
inconsiderate
conduct
as
assuredly
she
would
if
you
allowed
this
to
affect
your
to
which
geoffrey
replied
that
it
was
his
most
earnest
wish
that
at
whatever
cost
to
himself
miss
vere
should
learn
again
to
trust
and
rely
on
him
as
she
had
done
hitherto
only
fear
he
added
it
will
be
impossible
for
her
to
do
so
she
said
she
should
never
feel
comfortable
with
me
yes
replied
veronica
when
she
said
that
she
was
startled
and
distressed
there
is
no
fear
but
what
she
will
soon
be
quite
happy
and
at
ease
with
probably
to
esteem
you
more
highly
than
before
for
she
is
the
sort
of
girl
thoroughly
to
appreciate
manly
generosity
of
the
only
you
do
not
allow
time
for
the
unavoidable
feeling
of
awkwardness
at
first
to
stiffen
into
lasting
coldness
and
constraint
do
not
put
off
seeing
her
if
you
can
arrange
with
margaret
and
georgie
copley
to
ride
i
will
ask
them
here
to
luncheon
in
the
first
place
so
that
you
can
avoid
the
embarrassment
of
a
just
at
the
very
geoffrey
thanked
veronica
warmly
and
promised
for
the
future
implicitly
to
follow
her
advice
so
it
came
to
pass
that
the
following
day
somewhat
to
her
surprise
marion
received
a
note
from
baldwin
saying
that
at
the
usual
hour
the
misses
copley
escorted
by
himself
would
call
for
her
at
the
cross
house
as
they
had
arranged
to
have
a
good
long
ride
out
past
brackley
village
in
the
direction
of
the
old
abbey
am
glad
he
has
made
up
his
mind
to
be
sensible
was
reflection
he
is
very
good
and
i
hope
he
will
soon
fall
in
love
with
somebody
much
nicer
and
prettier
than
when
they
met
geoffrey
look
just
the
same
as
usual
better
spirits
than
ever
the
copley
girls
pronounced
him
even
marion
hardly
detected
the
forcedness
in
his
merriment
the
want
of
ring
in
his
usually
irresistibly
hearty
laugh
he
did
his
very
utmost
in
his
unselfish
anxiety
to
set
her
thoroughly
at
ease
only
he
could
not
help
the
crimson
flush
that
would
overspread
his
fair
boyish
face
when
she
addressed
him
specially
or
when
once
or
twice
their
hands
came
in
contact
as
he
arranged
her
reins
or
helped
her
in
mounting
and
descending
from
the
rather
imposing
attitude
of
back
marion
heartily
wished
the
bay
mare
were
a
pony
that
day
for
in
a
perverse
spirit
of
independence
she
chose
to
attempt
to
mount
by
herself
which
endeavour
as
under
the
circumstances
might
have
been
predicted
resulted
in
utter
failure
and
an
ignominious
descent
all
places
in
the
arms
oh
how
angry
marion
was
she
did
not
feel
much
inclined
for
talking
nor
was
she
much
called
upon
to
do
so
her
companions
all
three
chattered
incessantly
she
hardly
heard
what
they
were
saying
when
a
question
from
margaret
copley
recalled
her
to
herself
they
were
passing
near
the
ruined
abbey
at
brackley
two
or
three
miles
distant
from
the
present
residence
of
its
owners
you
have
seen
the
new
abbey
miss
vere
asked
margaret
is
only
called
new
you
know
in
contradistinction
to
the
ruin
for
in
reality
it
is
a
couple
of
hundred
years
old
i
have
never
seen
it
replied
marion
it
worth
seeing
in
itself
the
house
is
nothing
but
the
pictures
are
good
it
has
been
shut
up
for
ever
so
or
six
years
at
least
lord
brackley
fancies
it
does
not
suit
him
so
he
lives
almost
always
near
his
son
who
is
married
and
has
a
beautiful
place
belonging
to
his
wife
some
day
you
must
come
with
us
and
see
brackley
abbey
you
are
fond
of
pictures
i
understands
a
good
deal
more
about
them
than
either
you
or
i
margaret
said
georgie
tell
the
truth
what
i
go
to
the
abbey
for
is
to
gossip
with
the
fanny
old
housekeeper
we
were
there
the
other
day
and
i
declare
i
thought
i
should
never
get
away
from
her
she
told
me
the
history
of
every
family
in
the
indeed
resumed
margaret
is
a
wonderful
old
body
miss
vere
she
had
heard
of
your
advent
in
the
neighbourhood
and
was
very
curious
to
hear
all
about
you
she
remembered
your
mother
she
i
am
sure
she
asked
you
if
i
was
a
beauty
like
my
mother
said
marion
laughing
she
miss
copley
only
you
like
to
say
so
for
you
could
not
with
any
truth
have
said
i
was
you
really
think
baldwin
it
is
rather
a
misfortune
to
have
had
a
great
beauty
for
mother
bad
as
being
the
son
of
a
remarkably
clever
man
of
business
suggested
geoffrey
nearly
but
not
quite
for
only
think
what
terrible
things
have
been
entailed
on
you
by
your
being
your
son
said
marion
maliciously
geoffrey
was
pleased
to
see
her
sufficiently
at
ease
to
be
mischievous
and
replied
to
her
remark
by
a
kindly
glance
then
georgie
copley
took
up
the
strain
is
her
name
i
always
forget
it
housekeeper
i
mean
was
full
of
a
marriage
that
was
to
be
in
the
family
shortly
that
is
to
say
not
in
the
family
exactly
but
a
near
connection
sir
ralph
severn
lord
step
nephew
i
dare
say
you
know
him
geoffrey
he
used
to
come
here
sometimes
several
years
ago
before
the
abbey
was
shut
up
we
were
in
the
schoolroom
but
i
remember
seeing
him
it
was
long
before
he
got
the
never
met
him
said
baldwin
is
he
going
to
marry
sort
of
cousin
of
his
own
replied
georgie
miss
vyse
a
very
beautiful
girl
her
the
old
body
made
quite
a
romance
out
of
it
this
father
it
appears
was
in
old
days
the
lover
of
the
present
lady
severn
but
she
was
not
allowed
to
marry
him
as
she
was
an
heiress
she
used
to
be
here
a
good
deal
with
her
when
she
was
a
girl
that
is
how
hutton
knows
all
about
her
it
sounds
quite
like
a
does
it
not
the
children
of
the
two
poor
things
marrying
all
these
years
romantic
indeed
said
geoffrey
as
the
lady
is
beautiful
said
miss
copley
has
been
living
with
lady
severn
for
some
time
for
she
has
no
home
of
her
own
every
one
has
been
surprised
at
the
marriage
not
being
announced
sooner
hutton
said
she
had
only
just
heard
of
it
in
some
way
and
she
was
quite
full
of
then
they
talked
about
other
things
and
did
not
observe
increased
silence
which
lasted
till
they
said
goodbye
to
her
at
the
door
of
the
cross
house
a
few
days
previously
when
she
had
said
to
geoffrey
decisively
that
that
sort
of
was
done
with
for
her
and
entirely
she
had
meant
what
she
said
and
believed
her
own
assertion
now
when
she
hurried
upstairs
to
her
own
bedroom
in
the
dingy
mallingford
house
and
sat
down
on
the
hard
floor
in
her
muddy
with
but
one
wish
in
her
be
alone
out
of
the
reach
of
curious
unsympathetic
i
say
when
at
last
she
felt
free
to
think
over
to
realize
what
she
had
heard
she
knew
that
it
was
not
true
what
she
had
said
far
from
being
with
for
her
on
the
secret
unacknowledged
hope
that
for
her
a
happy
day
was
yet
to
dawn
when
all
the
mystery
would
be
explained
all
the
suffering
more
than
compensated
for
by
the
blessedness
of
the
this
hope
she
had
in
truth
been
living
through
all
these
weary
months
and
now
that
it
was
rudely
thus
snatched
away
that
all
was
indeed
for
ever
over
what
was
there
left
for
her
to
do
poor
weary
heartbroken
wanderer
in
a
very
strange
and
desolate
to
lie
down
and
die
chapter
xi
counsel
all
did
leaven
the
air
with
a
less
bitter
leaven
of
sure
despair
than
these
loved
browning
she
did
not
die
however
young
lives
do
not
end
so
easily
and
young
hearts
do
not
so
quickly
break
as
their
inexperienced
owners
would
imagine
she
was
very
very
for
many
weeks
she
lay
in
a
state
hardly
to
be
described
as
either
life
or
death
so
faint
was
the
line
between
the
two
so
many
times
we
thought
we
had
lost
sight
of
her
altogether
in
the
shadows
of
the
strange
land
that
is
ever
go
near
us
while
yet
a
very
far
way
off
it
was
at
this
time
i
first
knew
her
who
ever
after
was
very
dear
to
me
it
happened
accidentally
i
was
visiting
some
friends
at
mallingford
just
then
and
happened
to
be
calling
at
the
cross
house
the
day
the
poor
child
was
taken
very
day
after
the
ride
to
brackley
that
i
have
i
naturally
did
what
i
could
in
the
way
of
nursing
as
no
nearer
friend
appeared
to
be
at
hand
miss
tremlett
was
at
first
frightened
then
cross
in
which
state
she
continued
during
the
whole
of
illness
low
fever
the
doctors
called
it
but
that
is
a
vague
and
convenient
name
for
an
illness
somewhat
difficult
to
define
during
these
weeks
geoffrey
baldwin
was
very
miserable
he
suffered
not
merely
from
his
overwhelming
anxiety
but
also
from
self
reproach
and
remorse
for
despite
all
assurances
to
the
contrary
the
poor
fellow
could
not
rid
himself
of
an
utterly
irrational
notion
that
in
some
way
or
other
the
annoyance
he
had
caused
her
had
had
to
do
with
this
sudden
and
alarming
illness
it
was
not
really
sudden
though
the
tension
on
her
nervous
system
throughout
this
winter
had
been
great
quite
sufficient
to
account
for
her
present
state
the
real
wonder
being
that
she
had
held
out
so
long
when
at
last
she
began
to
get
better
delight
was
almost
piteous
marion
was
greatly
touched
by
indeed
no
woman
but
must
have
first
time
she
saw
him
again
his
pleasure
at
her
recovery
was
purely
unselfish
in
the
ordinary
sense
at
least
for
he
had
altogether
renounced
the
hope
of
ever
winning
her
for
his
own
only
wonder
he
said
to
veronica
she
could
forgive
my
presumption
as
she
did
since
her
illness
it
seems
to
me
she
has
become
more
beautiful
than
ever
i
feel
myself
like
a
great
when
i
am
beside
her
my
only
thought
is
how
i
can
make
up
to
her
for
all
i
have
caused
her
for
indeed
her
coming
to
this
place
at
all
was
greatly
owing
to
me
even
if
i
did
not
love
her
as
intensely
as
i
do
veronica
i
could
not
but
reproach
myself
when
i
think
of
my
it
was
useless
for
his
friend
to
contradict
him
it
pleased
him
far
more
when
she
set
to
work
to
carry
out
a
plan
for
gratification
which
at
first
sight
seemed
hopeless
enough
but
between
them
the
two
achieved
it
and
actually
obtained
miss
consent
to
their
proposal
that
now
that
she
was
sufficiently
recovered
to
be
moved
marion
clifford
could
complete
her
cure
by
spending
some
weeks
in
miss
pretty
little
house
miss
tremlett
was
in
her
heart
not
sorry
to
be
rid
of
so
troublesome
a
guest
as
a
invalid
though
her
consent
was
of
course
bestowed
as
ungraciously
as
possible
the
relief
to
marion
of
quitting
for
a
season
the
ugly
uncomfortable
room
in
which
for
five
weary
weeks
she
had
been
immured
was
unspeakable
and
once
she
was
established
in
the
pretty
little
chamber
so
carefully
prepared
for
her
she
astonished
herself
and
everyone
else
by
the
rapidity
of
her
recovery
the
long
dream
was
over
at
last
ralph
was
hers
no
longer
but
belonged
to
another
she
wished
to
hear
no
particulars
she
was
satisfied
to
know
the
bare
fact
she
had
torn
him
out
of
her
heart
and
life
and
henceforth
would
seek
to
forget
she
had
ever
known
him
god
had
been
good
to
her
had
given
her
true
and
kind
friends
whose
affection
she
would
do
her
best
to
repay
and
endeavour
to
turn
to
better
profit
the
life
so
lately
restored
to
her
for
it
seemed
to
her
in
truth
that
in
her
long
illness
she
had
in
a
sense
died
and
been
again
raised
to
life
thus
she
spoke
to
herself
in
the
many
quiet
hours
she
spent
in
little
and
a
sort
of
dreamy
peace
and
subdued
happiness
seemed
gradually
to
descend
upon
her
she
was
very
sweet
and
winning
in
those
days
to
veronica
she
grew
daily
dearer
and
more
precious
and
to
poor
geoffrey
ah
it
was
hard
upon
him
for
all
his
humility
and
unselfishness
and
she
silly
little
soul
said
to
herself
that
she
only
meant
to
be
gentle
and
sisterly
to
make
up
to
this
kind
generous
friend
for
her
former
petulance
and
roughness
partly
this
at
least
in
some
measure
she
began
instinctively
to
turn
to
him
out
of
a
sort
of
reaction
from
her
former
bitter
experience
he
might
not
be
very
clever
or
original
this
geoffrey
baldwin
he
was
certainly
wanting
in
that
extraordinary
inexpressible
perfect
congeniality
of
heart
or
mind
or
both
which
from
the
first
had
as
if
by
magic
drawn
and
attracted
her
to
ralph
but
at
least
he
was
tried
and
true
honest
and
devoted
to
the
very
core
and
oh
to
the
poor
little
heart
smarting
yet
under
its
sore
attraction
what
soothing
was
there
not
in
the
thought
that
he
at
least
loved
her
loved
her
with
a
love
which
she
felt
she
could
never
give
to
him
and
yet
though
no
coquette
she
no
longer
felt
inclined
to
discourage
him
for
after
all
she
was
a
thorough
woman
and
i
am
afraid
she
was
in
some
respects
incapable
of
such
a
love
of
for
her
for
through
it
all
as
we
have
seen
he
never
doubted
never
for
an
instant
mistrusted
her
whereas
she
naturally
enough
had
come
gradually
to
lose
her
trust
in
him
to
doubt
even
sometimes
if
indeed
he
had
ever
cared
for
her
as
she
for
him
and
already
she
was
beginning
to
say
to
herself
loved
him
veronica
watched
the
two
earnestly
and
anxiously
there
was
no
mystery
about
geoffrey
it
was
only
too
evident
that
more
than
ever
he
was
heart
and
soul
devoted
to
his
ward
in
his
eyes
more
beautiful
than
ever
from
the
yet
remaining
traces
of
her
severe
illness
her
thin
white
hands
her
pale
cheeks
and
hair
far
removed
from
its
former
luxuriance
i
not
grown
ugly
baldwin
she
said
one
day
half
in
earnest
half
in
joke
and
greatly
from
a
sort
of
instinctive
wish
to
test
her
power
over
him
at
my
hair
it
is
hardly
long
enough
to
twist
up
at
all
and
it
used
to
come
down
below
my
his
only
answer
was
to
pass
his
hand
softly
nay
almost
reverently
over
the
little
head
still
fair
and
graceful
though
pretty
brown
hair
poor
ralph
had
long
ago
admired
was
sadly
decreased
in
thickness
and
richness
marion
did
not
shrink
away
from
hand
they
happened
at
the
moment
to
be
alone
she
looked
up
in
his
face
and
saw
there
the
words
all
but
uttered
on
his
lips
though
in
a
sense
she
had
brought
it
on
herself
yet
now
she
shrank
from
it
felt
that
as
yet
at
least
she
could
not
bear
it
with
some
half
excuse
she
turned
away
quickly
and
left
the
room
but
what
she
had
seen
in
face
that
afternoon
decided
her
that
something
must
be
done
some
resolution
arrived
at
in
her
own
mind
as
it
was
easy
to
see
that
the
present
state
of
things
could
not
long
continue
it
was
now
the
beginning
of
may
fully
two
months
had
elapsed
since
the
ride
to
brackley
and
the
commencement
of
her
long
illness
spring
was
coming
on
apace
and
the
outside
world
looked
very
bright
and
sweet
that
evening
as
marion
sat
by
couch
in
the
of
the
little
there
was
a
resolution
in
the
mind
for
once
to
break
through
her
rule
of
reserve
and
seek
the
advice
of
the
true
and
wise
friend
beside
her
for
some
minutes
they
had
been
silent
suddenly
marion
spoke
you
know
miss
veronica
that
i
have
been
here
nearly
three
weeks
soon
i
must
he
thinking
of
the
cross
house
miss
temple
laid
her
hand
caressingly
on
poor
child
she
said
surely
there
is
no
hurry
i
wish
i
could
keep
you
here
always
but
with
the
prospect
of
my
coming
to
me
for
the
winter
i
can
not
do
so
i
hoped
however
that
harry
would
have
had
a
day
or
two
to
spend
with
you
before
you
return
to
miss
is
there
no
chance
of
it
he
must
be
so
anxious
to
see
you
since
your
is
not
a
chance
of
his
coming
till
june
said
marion
then
it
will
be
a
real
goodbye
he
is
sure
to
go
abroad
immediately
no
dear
miss
veronica
it
is
very
horrible
but
i
must
be
thinking
of
going
that
dreadful
life
at
my
so
you
know
rather
than
go
on
with
it
i
sometimes
wish
i
had
died
last
miss
veronica
made
no
reply
then
she
said
very
softly
and
timidly
darling
marion
forgive
me
if
i
appear
officious
or
intrusive
but
i
am
sure
that
you
know
there
is
another
home
open
to
you
whose
owner
would
think
himself
blessed
beyond
measure
to
welcome
you
to
it
he
has
told
me
of
his
disappointment
are
you
quite
sure
my
dear
child
that
there
can
never
be
any
hope
for
him
that
you
can
never
bring
yourself
to
think
favourably
of
this
marion
looked
up
into
her
face
she
was
sitting
on
the
ground
at
side
with
a
slight
smile
she
appeared
perfectly
composed
her
colour
did
not
vary
in
the
least
miss
temple
was
far
more
embarrassed
than
she
am
glad
you
have
spoken
of
this
miss
veronica
said
the
girl
i
wish
very
much
to
talk
to
you
about
it
i
am
in
a
great
puzzle
the
truth
of
it
is
i
have
already
in
a
sense
come
to
think
favourably
of
it
and
yet
i
fear
not
so
in
short
in
the
way
that
to
be
thought
of
i
like
him
most
thoroughly
and
i
like
to
know
that
he
cares
for
me
i
am
weary
very
weary
of
having
no
home
no
nest
of
my
own
and
if
i
yielded
to
my
inclination
i
would
run
to
geoffrey
and
ask
him
to
take
care
of
me
and
be
good
to
me
and
i
believe
i
could
be
a
good
wife
to
him
but
dear
miss
veronica
is
this
enough
is
it
not
selfish
of
me
so
to
take
advantage
or
this
good
great
love
for
me
when
i
know
ah
how
surely
that
never
can
i
give
him
the
same
in
return
for
here
at
last
her
pale
face
flushed
and
her
voice
sank
i
have
known
what
it
is
to
give
the
whole
love
of
being
self
utterly
and
entirely
to
another
and
this
i
could
never
do
veronica
sighed
again
poor
child
was
all
she
said
but
marion
urged
her
to
say
more
me
a
little
more
in
the
first
place
was
her
reply
other
whoever
he
may
be
i
do
not
wish
to
know
but
tell
me
is
it
altogether
and
for
ever
over
between
you
and
for
ever
answered
marion
firmly
this
time
he
is
the
husband
of
another
you
you
care
for
him
still
persisted
veronica
her
own
tender
heart
quivering
at
the
thought
of
the
pain
this
necessary
probing
of
hers
must
he
inflicting
on
marion
the
girl
for
a
moment
sat
perfectly
silent
her
eyes
gazing
out
on
the
pretty
garden
of
which
nevertheless
they
saw
nothing
then
she
said
slowly
but
distinctly
and
without
as
i
know
myself
i
do
not
care
for
him
now
he
has
tried
me
too
cruelly
brought
me
in
sight
of
the
very
gates
of
death
and
when
there
i
tore
him
him
the
husband
of
that
girl
out
of
my
heart
for
ever
i
forgive
him
but
i
do
not
love
him
any
more
and
geoffrey
is
so
good
and
kind
and
i
am
so
lonely
dear
miss
veronica
may
i
not
give
myself
the
only
pleasure
left
me
that
of
making
another
person
happy
i
would
i
do
love
him
in
a
perfectly
different
way
more
as
i
love
harry
but
it
might
grow
to
be
a
love
more
worthy
of
his
for
i
would
indeed
try
to
be
a
good
wife
to
him
and
i
go
back
to
the
cross
house
and
to
my
utter
loneliness
oh
do
tell
me
what
to
veronica
was
sorely
troubled
can
not
tell
you
my
dearest
i
dare
not
even
advise
you
she
said
suddenly
an
idea
occurred
to
her
would
you
like
the
idea
of
laying
it
all
before
the
chief
person
concerned
geoffrey
himself
he
is
not
usually
very
thoughtful
or
deliberate
and
in
the
present
case
it
seems
too
much
to
expect
that
he
should
be
so
but
he
is
very
honest
and
conscientious
and
i
believe
though
the
question
is
one
of
vital
interest
for
himself
he
is
capable
of
looking
at
it
from
your
side
too
however
it
may
be
i
see
no
other
course
before
you
tell
him
what
you
feel
you
can
give
him
and
leave
it
to
him
to
said
marion
thoughtfully
think
i
will
do
as
you
and
then
they
were
silent
for
a
time
and
when
they
talked
again
it
was
of
perfectly
different
things
the
next
morning
was
geoffrey
came
as
was
now
his
daily
habit
to
spend
an
hour
in
two
with
his
friends
he
found
marion
alone
miss
temple
being
later
than
usual
in
taking
her
place
for
the
day
on
the
invalid
couch
where
her
life
was
spent
baldwin
looked
round
nervously
he
was
pleased
and
yet
half
alarmed
at
finding
himself
alone
with
his
ward
for
the
first
time
almost
since
the
memorable
february
afternoon
when
he
had
broken
his
promise
to
veronica
marion
was
sitting
working
as
calmly
as
possible
she
was
in
no
hurry
to
hasten
the
inevitable
explanation
now
that
she
had
made
up
her
mind
what
to
do
she
was
perfectly
content
to
leave
in
hands
the
when
and
where
of
the
dénouement
so
she
stitched
away
composedly
geoffrey
sat
down
and
looked
at
her
for
a
few
minutes
made
after
the
manner
of
people
in
such
circumstances
some
particularly
stupid
remark
the
weather
and
then
began
to
fidget
at
last
he
plunged
in
head
foremost
vere
he
said
you
mind
putting
down
your
work
for
a
few
minutes
and
listening
to
something
i
have
got
to
say
miss
vere
did
as
she
was
requested
and
geoffrey
continued
did
not
think
that
day
you
were
angry
with
me
i
did
not
think
then
that
i
could
ever
bring
myself
to
risk
your
anger
again
but
it
is
no
use
it
is
worse
than
ever
with
wretchedness
of
being
near
you
and
yet
to
know
it
is
all
hopeless
what
i
want
to
say
to
you
is
that
i
can
not
stand
it
your
illness
was
so
terrible
to
me
it
showed
me
even
more
clearly
than
before
how
insane
i
am
about
it
i
stay
near
you
in
this
way
marion
humbugging
about
friendship
and
all
that
when
i
know
that
twenty
million
friendships
would
not
express
a
particle
of
my
utter
devotion
to
you
i
say
it
well
i
am
abominably
stupid
and
boorish
only
i
want
to
tell
you
that
i
must
go
away
i
shall
look
after
your
interests
to
very
best
of
my
power
only
have
some
mercy
on
me
and
try
me
in
this
terrible
way
by
asking
me
to
stay
near
he
rose
in
his
earnestness
and
came
nearer
her
his
tall
strong
figure
shaken
with
emotion
his
handsome
face
quivering
with
the
strength
of
his
conflicting
feelings
marion
was
far
too
tender
of
heart
to
tantalize
or
try
him
unnecessarily
she
too
rose
and
stood
beside
him
what
a
slight
fragile
creature
she
seemed
and
yet
probably
the
stronger
of
the
two
in
much
that
constitutes
real
strength
of
nature
she
spoke
very
quietly
and
calmly
baldwin
she
said
am
more
grieved
more
deeply
pained
than
i
can
possibly
put
in
words
to
know
that
i
have
caused
you
suffering
i
was
rough
and
hasty
that
day
but
i
have
changed
since
then
i
will
not
ask
you
to
stay
near
me
if
it
is
painful
to
you
but
you
must
decide
for
yourself
after
hearing
what
i
want
to
tell
then
in
a
few
simple
words
she
sketched
for
him
the
history
of
her
life
and
its
great
disappointment
she
entered
into
no
particulars
at
the
end
of
her
narration
geoffrey
was
perfectly
ignorant
as
to
when
and
where
all
this
had
happened
nor
did
he
in
the
least
care
to
know
he
was
conscious
only
of
the
one
great
central
fact
marion
his
marion
for
whom
he
would
have
died
had
loved
some
one
else
as
he
loved
her
it
was
a
great
blow
to
him
for
it
was
altogether
unexpected
the
words
in
which
she
had
before
repulsed
him
had
not
to
him
as
to
quicker
perception
told
of
anything
of
this
sort
in
his
simplicity
he
had
understood
them
only
as
referring
with
the
exaggeration
of
youth
to
her
death
and
the
many
troubles
consequent
upon
it
he
had
intended
no
special
allusion
when
he
said
something
about
at
the
probability
of
her
before
long
choosing
another
guardian
he
had
perfectly
understood
that
she
did
not
care
for
him
in
any
but
a
friendly
way
but
it
had
never
struck
him
that
already
her
affections
had
been
elsewhere
bestowed
she
was
so
young
and
harry
had
all
but
told
him
how
cordially
he
approved
of
the
idea
and
had
tacitly
encouraged
him
in
his
suit
for
some
minutes
geoffrey
made
no
reply
he
stood
leaning
on
the
chair
from
which
marion
had
lately
risen
thinking
deeply
doing
his
honest
best
to
see
light
through
this
matter
then
the
same
question
rose
to
his
lips
as
had
occurred
to
miss
veronica
me
he
said
tell
me
one
thing
this
man
whom
you
have
spoken
of
to
you
still
love
him
marion
i
do
not
ask
or
expect
you
to
say
you
could
ever
care
for
me
as
you
have
done
for
him
that
i
understand
would
be
impossible
only
to
some
extent
i
must
know
my
own
chance
so
tell
me
my
poor
darling
do
you
still
love
him
and
marion
the
second
time
made
the
answer
i
know
myself
i
do
not
love
him
then
said
so
my
darling
i
am
not
afraid
if
the
whole
devotion
of
my
being
can
win
you
to
love
me
if
ever
so
little
i
shall
be
well
repaid
and
at
least
i
can
make
your
life
a
degree
less
lonely
in
time
even
this
sorrow
of
the
past
may
to
some
measure
fade
away
your
brave
truthfulness
has
only
made
me
love
you
more
and
at
least
my
marion
you
do
not
dislike
me
and
the
girl
looked
up
at
him
through
the
tears
that
were
fast
filling
her
sweet
eyes
and
answered
softly
you
geoffrey
the
gentlest
truest
friend
that
ever
a
woman
had
heaven
help
me
to
be
worthy
of
geoffrey
took
her
in
his
arms
and
kissed
her
fervently
on
brow
and
eyes
and
mouth
then
as
he
let
her
go
he
asked
her
if
she
were
angry
with
him
for
being
so
bold
he
need
not
have
done
so
she
was
perfectly
at
ease
and
as
little
unembarrassed
as
if
her
lover
had
been
harry
she
said
no
why
should
you
think
so
yet
she
was
timid
and
sensitive
enough
though
now
her
heart
beat
as
steadily
and
softly
as
usual
though
there
was
no
gush
on
her
cheek
no
quiver
on
her
lips
it
had
not
always
been
thus
with
her
ralph
severn
who
had
never
kissed
her
hardly
ever
ventured
to
press
her
hand
had
yet
had
strange
power
to
affect
her
his
step
on
the
stair
the
slightest
touch
of
his
hand
his
very
presence
in
the
room
had
brought
light
to
her
eyes
colour
to
her
cheeks
glad
throbbing
to
her
heart
but
embrace
she
took
with
gentle
calmness
perfect
absence
of
emotion
of
any
kind
was
it
indeed
true
that
as
she
had
said
her
haste
her
heart
was
in
a
sense
dead
she
thought
so
therein
lay
her
excuse
and
thus
it
came
to
pass
that
marion
vere
a
woman
of
strong
affections
dear
perceptions
and
earnest
in
her
endeavour
to
choose
the
right
and
reject
the
wrong
committed
the
grievous
error
to
call
it
by
no
harsher
name
of
marrying
a
man
whom
she
knew
and
owned
to
she
did
not
love

they
were
married
in
the
end
of
june
after
all
engagement
of
six
weeks
only
there
were
no
reasons
for
delay
and
several
which
made
expedition
expedient
harry
spent
his
last
fortnight
in
england
with
them
and
the
marriage
took
place
at
its
close
it
was
a
very
quiet
affair
of
which
recent
illness
and
continued
mourning
for
her
father
were
patent
and
satisfactory
explanations
even
to
the
gossips
of
mallingford
a
sorrowful
farewell
to
harry
whose
whispered
words
of
relief
and
satisfaction
at
leaving
his
sister
in
such
good
hands
were
the
most
grateful
to
her
ears
of
the
congratulations
forthcoming
on
this
as
on
all
such
occasions
a
fervent
blessing
from
veronica
a
snappish
adieu
from
miss
tremlett
and
the
bride
and
bridegroom
were
on
their
own
account
on
the
life
journey
which
up
hill
and
down
dale
through
fair
weather
and
foul
they
had
chosen
to
travel
together
they
did
not
spend
their
honeymoon
abroad
geoffrey
proposed
that
they
should
do
so
but
marion
negatived
it
and
decided
in
favour
of
a
certain
county
which
i
need
not
particularize
save
by
saying
that
its
scenery
is
picturesque
its
wayside
inns
charming
and
its
fishing
the
best
of
its
kind
geoffrey
was
very
fond
of
fishing
and
marion
was
well
content
to
spend
the
quiet
sleepy
midsummer
days
book
in
hand
lounging
on
the
grassy
banks
at
his
side
she
was
not
very
strong
yet
and
travelling
tired
her
so
after
a
week
or
rambling
they
settled
down
in
one
of
the
sweetest
nooks
they
had
come
upon
and
took
up
their
temporary
abode
at
the
very
prettiest
of
the
wayside
inns
i
alluded
to
by
name
and
sign
the
neighbourhood
was
not
much
frequented
save
by
anglers
and
artists
of
both
of
whom
there
were
plenty
but
it
was
before
the
railway
days
in
this
pretty
county
and
tourists
of
the
more
objectionable
kinds
were
unknown
so
everything
as
to
outer
surroundings
was
charming
and
the
two
made
a
very
satisfactory
pair
he
so
handsome
she
so
sweet
both
to
all
appearance
perfectly
happy
in
themselves
and
each
other
which
to
a
great
extent
was
the
case
geoffrey
was
happy
beyond
all
he
had
ever
dreamt
of
as
possible
his
only
misgiving
the
fear
that
he
was
all
unworthy
of
so
sweet
a
bride
his
only
anxiety
lest
the
wind
should
blow
on
her
too
rudely
or
the
slightest
roughness
be
in
her
path
beyond
this
absorbing
dread
of
not
succeeding
in
making
her
happy
the
impression
on
his
sunny
hopeful
nature
left
by
the
sad
little
history
of
her
love
had
already
began
to
fade
he
reverenced
and
trusted
her
so
deeply
that
the
slight
melancholy
still
clinging
to
her
seemed
to
him
to
render
her
only
the
more
beautiful
the
more
tender
and
precious
and
worthy
of
all
devotion
doubt
suspicion
jealousy
or
even
the
shadows
of
such
unlovely
visitants
were
utterly
foreign
to
his
being
she
had
told
him
it
was
sad
page
in
her
history
he
believed
her
and
loved
her
the
more
for
the
suffering
she
had
endured
she
had
stirred
up
in
him
by
her
recital
no
feeling
of
anger
or
irritation
towards
his
unknown
rival
she
had
blamed
no
one
for
what
had
happened
all
she
told
him
had
been
the
result
of
unpropitious
circumstances
in
saying
which
she
had
done
wisely
it
made
it
the
easier
for
him
to
forget
what
there
was
little
use
in
his
remembering
and
she
herself
was
she
too
happy
after
all
the
storms
and
wearing
suspense
through
which
she
had
passed
had
she
in
truth
found
a
haven
of
rest
and
security
she
thought
so
am
content
she
said
to
herself
and
at
peace
which
is
more
than
many
can
true
but
not
what
one
likes
to
hear
of
as
the
nearest
approach
to
happiness
to
be
hoped
for
by
a
girl
over
whose
head
twenty
summers
have
barely
passed
at
the
sign
of
the
peacock
for
a
time
we
must
leave
them
while
we
hear
a
little
more
as
to
what
in
these
last
few
months
had
happened
to
ralph
he
remained
in
italy
with
his
mother
and
her
household
through
the
winter
which
marion
had
passed
at
mallingford
the
month
of
may
saw
them
all
at
last
at
medhurst
but
not
for
very
long
the
place
had
been
to
some
extent
neglected
during
the
two
or
three
years
of
the
absence
the
house
looked
dingy
and
smelt
fusty
before
they
could
take
up
their
quarters
therein
good
before
marriage
could
be
celebrated
with
fitting
magnificence
the
mansion
must
be
thoroughly
i
believe
is
the
correct
technical
expression
so
for
a
season
medhurst
was
delivered
over
to
the
tender
mercies
of
painters
and
upholsterers
and
decorators
and
family
par
excellence
of
the
neighbourhood
flitted
for
the
time
to
a
favourite
and
pleasant
little
in
the
same
county
where
geoffrey
and
his
wife
were
spending
their
honeymoon
but
a
few
drive
from
the
very
inn
which
for
some
days
past
they
had
made
their
sir
ralph
was
still
with
his
mother
she
had
a
of
his
remaining
with
her
for
the
first
few
months
of
her
return
home
and
he
having
no
pressing
interests
of
his
own
was
willing
enough
to
agree
to
her
wishes
florence
was
no
longer
with
them
the
few
weeks
intervening
between
their
arrival
in
england
and
the
time
fixed
for
her
marriage
she
had
preferred
to
spend
in
the
terrace
with
her
mother
and
sisters
nor
did
this
decision
call
for
any
great
exercise
of
on
her
part
for
besides
the
real
pleasure
of
being
with
her
relations
and
showing
off
the
honours
present
and
prospective
attendant
on
the
bride
of
chepstow
the
golden
her
modest
dwelling
was
conveniently
situated
for
expending
to
the
best
advantage
in
the
purchase
of
a
trousseau
the
very
liberal
parting
gift
of
her
aunt
and
second
then
in
the
future
glittered
medhurst
and
the
gorgeous
preparations
for
the
nuptials
of
the
beauty
and
the
millionaire
truly
cup
of
happiness
was
full
and
plainly
speaking
she
was
not
missed
by
her
late
entertainers
lady
severn
and
her
son
got
on
much
better
without
her
sir
ralph
was
therefore
at
the
little
of
springs
when
one
day
about
the
middle
of
july
a
strange
thing
happened
to
him
he
received
one
morning
forwarded
from
medhurst
an
indian
letter
addressed
to
him
in
the
same
handwriting
as
the
envelope
which
last
year
had
brought
back
to
him
his
own
letter
to
miss
freer
a
silent
message
from
poor
tomb
telling
that
his
last
hope
was
gone
he
was
alone
when
he
received
this
unexpected
letter
fortunately
so
for
not
all
his
practised
could
have
concealed
from
other
eyes
the
overwhelming
intensity
of
emotion
caused
by
the
perusal
of
its
extraordinary
contents
first
he
read
the
letter
from
colonel
archer
which
he
discovered
speedily
was
but
an
explanation
to
a
certain
extent
of
a
second
which
it
enclosed
in
a
blank
envelope
but
carefully
sealed
with
black
wax
evidently
by
colonel
own
hands
as
it
bore
his
crest
george
archer
was
not
given
to
prolixity
of
style
in
his
written
communications
his
letter
therefore
may
be
given
verbatim
dear
will
remember
my
writing
to
you
a
few
days
after
my
death
enclosing
to
you
a
letter
which
she
desired
me
to
send
to
you
as
quickly
as
possible
and
which
she
directed
me
to
find
in
a
certain
place
do
you
remember
also
my
saying
to
you
that
though
i
had
followed
her
directions
exactly
the
state
in
which
i
found
the
letter
did
not
altogether
correspond
with
her
description
she
said
i
should
find
it
all
written
and
signed
but
not
folded
or
addressed
on
the
contrary
the
letter
i
sent
you
i
found
folded
and
addressed
all
ready
in
short
save
the
stamps
to
be
posted
i
am
terribly
afraid
my
dear
severn
that
i
have
made
some
dreadful
mistake
evidently
there
were
two
letters
to
be
forwarded
to
you
of
which
the
one
i
did
send
and
which
i
much
fear
was
the
least
important
had
escaped
my
poor
memory
only
yesterday
being
obliged
to
search
among
my
papers
for
a
missing
document
of
some
importance
i
came
upon
the
enclosed
letter
in
one
of
the
leaves
of
her
written
and
signed
as
she
said
and
lying
there
evidently
waiting
to
be
by
her
folded
and
addressed
not
improbably
she
had
intended
to
enclose
it
to
you
in
the
same
envelope
as
contained
the
one
i
sent
i
now
recollect
that
i
felt
surprised
at
finding
it
unsealed
as
little
as
possible
of
the
enclosed
has
been
read
by
me
in
my
first
astonishment
at
my
discovery
i
read
some
lines
of
the
first
page
enough
to
explain
to
me
that
without
doubt
it
was
the
letter
cissy
referred
to
the
name
of
my
young
cousin
marion
vere
caught
my
eye
also
that
of
a
miss
freer
with
whom
i
am
wholly
unacquainted
marion
vere
spent
the
winter
at
altes
with
my
wife
it
is
probable
you
there
met
her
beyond
this
the
whole
affair
is
a
mystery
to
me
nor
do
i
ever
wish
to
have
it
explained
unless
agreeable
to
you
to
do
so
i
earnestly
trust
my
culpable
but
not
altogether
inexcusable
negligence
may
have
done
no
harm
it
will
be
an
immense
relief
to
me
to
hear
this
i
write
in
haste
to
catch
the
mail
so
believe
me
my
dear
severn
most
truly
ralph
read
through
this
letter
carefully
and
felt
after
doing
so
as
if
he
were
dreaming
what
could
it
mean
vere
who
could
she
be
freer
a
total
stranger
to
colonel
archer
not
for
some
moments
did
it
occur
to
him
to
turn
for
explanation
to
the
sealed
enclosure
here
indeed
he
met
with
it
in
full
with
feelings
of
the
utmost
astonishment
and
bewilderment
succeeded
as
gradually
the
mists
cleared
away
by
a
revulsion
of
almost
intoxicating
intensity
of
delight
gratitude
returning
hope
and
reviving
anticipation
did
his
mind
at
last
take
in
the
meaning
of
the
strange
solution
of
all
past
mystery
this
then
had
been
the
poor
secret
this
the
reason
of
all
the
mistakes
and
his
marion
after
all
was
no
poor
little
struggling
governess
on
whom
though
he
would
have
been
proud
to
wed
her
his
narrow
prejudiced
world
might
have
looked
askance
but
the
daughter
of
one
of
the
leading
men
of
the
day
come
of
a
stock
with
which
even
lady
severn
herself
could
have
no
fault
to
find
and
she
had
dreaded
his
blaming
her
innocent
deceit
cissy
told
him
had
feared
it
might
lower
her
irretrievably
in
his
eyes
truly
as
the
daughter
of
an
ancient
house
he
could
love
her
no
more
fervently
than
as
the
despised
little
governess
sprang
from
no
one
knew
where
with
even
the
shadow
of
a
suspected
disgrace
on
her
family
but
yet
in
a
very
different
sense
this
revelation
did
increase
his
devotion
for
it
showed
him
yet
more
the
unselfishness
of
her
character
and
its
rare
union
of
strength
and
gentleness
and
made
him
the
more
anxious
to
compensate
to
her
by
a
life
of
happiness
of
perfect
mutual
love
and
trust
for
all
he
now
well
understood
she
must
have
so
uncomplainingly
suffered
it
had
not
been
a
wise
proceeding
this
little
comedy
of
names
and
positions
are
edged
tools
in
the
hands
of
inexperienced
girls
of
much
even
partial
judgment
of
all
that
marion
had
done
could
all
but
allow
but
all
the
same
he
could
not
but
lore
and
admire
her
the
more
for
the
sisterly
devotion
which
prompted
the
scheme
the
bravery
and
patience
which
had
enabled
her
to
carry
it
out
some
reflection
decided
him
that
no
time
must
be
lost
in
tracing
by
the
light
of
communication
the
girl
whom
he
had
little
expected
ever
to
see
again
it
all
straight
sailing
enough
now
the
daughter
of
so
a
man
as
hartford
vere
would
be
easy
to
find
he
remembered
hearing
that
the
orphans
of
the
late
vere
had
been
left
but
scantily
provided
for
in
all
probability
therefore
their
town
house
had
been
given
up
and
the
young
people
themselves
received
into
the
families
of
relatives
for
he
remembered
too
that
marion
had
told
him
more
than
once
that
she
had
no
mother
still
he
decided
that
london
itself
was
the
proper
place
in
which
to
make
enquiry
and
thither
he
resolved
as
speedily
a
possible
to
betake
himself
one
preliminary
step
only
he
felt
it
advisable
to
take
he
must
come
to
some
understanding
with
his
mother
on
the
subject
of
his
probable
marriage
not
that
he
now
anticipated
much
difficulty
in
this
quarter
for
things
were
very
different
between
lady
severn
and
her
son
from
what
they
had
been
during
the
reign
of
irritating
influence
the
instinct
had
divined
the
change
that
had
passed
over
her
son
and
now
that
she
had
come
to
know
him
better
and
love
him
more
there
were
few
things
she
would
not
have
agreed
to
to
give
him
pleasure
often
when
he
little
suspected
it
her
heart
ached
for
him
when
the
outward
signs
of
the
secret
sorrow
that
had
so
changed
him
came
before
her
notice
the
many
grey
hairs
mingled
with
his
black
the
new
furrows
round
eyes
and
mouth
the
general
air
of
depression
and
hopelessness
only
too
plainly
visible
even
in
one
who
had
never
been
other
than
quiet
and
grave
she
would
have
given
worlds
to
have
obtained
his
confidence
but
she
felt
instinctively
that
she
had
neglected
till
too
late
to
seek
what
now
she
would
have
prized
so
highly
it
was
with
no
little
gratification
therefore
that
she
this
morning
acceded
to
sir
request
that
she
would
spare
him
a
little
time
to
talk
over
some
matters
of
importance
connected
with
his
private
affairs
no
bad
news
i
trust
she
said
as
a
new
idea
struck
her
do
not
look
as
if
it
were
but
i
do
trust
you
are
not
going
to
tell
me
you
are
thinking
of
leaving
me
for
long
certainly
he
replied
cordially
week
or
two
at
most
will
be
the
extent
of
my
absence
at
present
no
my
dear
mother
what
i
have
to
say
to
you
is
more
likely
to
lead
to
my
settling
near
you
permanently
a
year
or
two
ago
i
displeased
you
very
much
by
not
falling
in
with
certain
matrimonial
schemes
of
yours
on
my
behalf
i
want
to
know
if
you
have
forgiven
me
said
lady
severn
meant
it
for
the
best
ralph
but
i
now
think
you
were
wiser
than
i
it
would
not
have
been
a
desirable
arrangement
i
am
quite
satisfied
that
florence
should
not
be
more
nearly
connected
with
i
want
more
than
that
mother
pursued
ralph
want
you
to
do
more
than
forgive
me
for
not
marrying
to
please
you
i
want
your
cordial
entire
consent
to
my
you
to
give
you
marrying
to
please
lady
eyes
filled
with
tears
a
moment
or
two
she
hesitated
then
said
slowly
and
distinctly
shall
have
it
ralph
whomever
you
choose
as
your
wife
i
shall
cordially
receive
as
my
daughter
you
have
suffered
my
poor
boy
long
and
deeply
i
thank
god
if
things
are
looking
brighter
with
you
one
thing
i
must
say
and
if
it
pains
you
forgive
me
i
care
about
money
we
have
plenty
and
whenever
you
marry
what
john
had
shall
be
yours
his
daughters
are
provided
for
i
have
not
forgotten
how
well
you
behaved
at
that
time
ralph
and
as
to
herself
personally
i
feel
no
uneasiness
about
my
future
daughter
but
ralph
you
have
queer
notions
about
some
things
tell
me
is
she
a
lady
i
would
like
the
good
old
stock
to
be
kept
up
as
i
have
promised
so
i
will
do
whoever
she
be
i
will
receive
her
cordially
but
it
would
be
an
immense
relief
to
my
mind
to
know
that
she
really
was
one
of
our
own
ralph
smiled
slightly
but
there
was
no
bitterness
in
his
smile
he
could
afford
now
to
be
lenient
towards
what
he
considered
his
little
foibles
that
relief
i
can
give
you
mother
he
said
is
a
lady
even
in
the
very
narrowest
and
most
conventional
sense
of
the
word
as
well
in
the
wider
and
far
more
beautiful
one
she
comes
of
a
stock
as
good
than
your
own
better
at
least
in
so
far
as
i
think
i
have
heard
there
is
no
family
of
more
ancient
standing
in
the
county
they
belong
to
and
people
too
they
have
been
on
the
whole
which
though
of
course
a
much
less
important
consideration
is
satisfactory
to
lady
severn
had
no
idea
her
son
was
her
is
not
rich
but
that
i
know
you
care
about
as
to
herself
i
would
rather
not
tell
you
more
just
yet
her
name
too
i
should
prefer
not
mentioning
unless
you
particularly
wish
to
hear
no
thank
you
said
his
mother
am
quite
content
to
wait
till
you
feel
ready
to
tell
it
which
was
a
great
story
am
so
thankful
to
know
what
you
have
told
me
for
you
know
ralph
she
went
on
apologetically
were
rather
peculiar
in
your
ideas
about
social
position
and
all
that
there
was
that
young
girl
at
altes
you
remember
miss
freer
whom
florence
took
such
a
dislike
to
at
one
was
very
absurd
of
at
one
time
i
really
had
a
fear
of
you
in
that
quarter
she
was
a
very
sweet
creature
i
must
say
i
took
quite
an
interest
in
her
at
first
till
florence
told
me
how
underhand
and
designing
she
was
not
that
i
altogether
believed
it
florence
was
apt
to
be
there
certainly
was
something
strangely
reserved
about
her
for
so
young
a
person
but
it
may
have
been
family
troubles
poor
thing
i
often
wish
we
had
her
back
again
for
certainly
the
children
were
better
with
her
than
they
have
been
ralph
did
not
reply
to
this
long
speech
at
which
however
his
mother
was
not
surprised
for
she
had
rather
a
habit
of
maundering
on
in
a
thinking
aloud
fashion
once
she
got
hold
of
a
subject
without
expecting
any
special
notice
to
be
taken
of
what
she
was
saying
nor
had
she
the
slightest
suspicion
that
there
was
any
connection
between
this
long
ago
discarded
dread
of
hers
and
her
unexpected
announcement
of
his
matrimonial
intentions
she
felt
not
a
little
curious
as
to
who
her
elect
could
possibly
be
ralph
was
so
renowned
a
misogynist
that
where
and
how
he
had
come
to
fall
in
love
she
was
quite
at
a
loss
to
conceive
his
acquaintances
were
few
his
friends
fewer
of
the
small
number
of
eligible
young
ladies
she
ever
remembered
his
speaking
to
more
than
once
not
one
she
felt
intuitively
certain
could
be
the
mysterious
lady
of
his
thoughts
heaven
she
is
a
lady
thought
mother
have
no
fears
on
any
other
score
for
though
so
peculiar
he
is
thoroughly
to
be
depended
on
as
to
essentials
and
his
taste
is
refined
she
is
sure
to
be
pretty
and
pleasing
if
no
more
most
probably
he
has
met
her
at
the
house
of
some
of
his
learned
friends
sir
archibald
cunningham
ralph
spent
a
week
there
last
spring
just
before
the
time
he
grew
so
quiet
and
depressed
how
stupid
of
me
not
to
have
thought
of
it
before
to
be
sure
sir
archibald
is
a
bachelor
so
it
be
a
he
is
sure
to
have
nieces
or
cousins
and
good
family
too
yes
the
cunninghams
may
quite
pass
muster
scotch
too
poor
and
proud
no
doubt
oh
yes
the
thing
is
as
clear
as
daylight
only
i
wonder
why
it
has
been
so
long
coming
to
anything
he
have
been
afraid
of
my
disapproval
i
am
sure
i
have
always
shown
myself
ready
to
agree
to
anything
in
reason
ah
yes
a
niece
of
sir
i
am
glad
i
have
satisfied
myself
about
and
became
henceforth
an
institution
in
the
good
mind
at
present
she
regarded
her
with
feelings
of
prospective
motherly
affection
and
began
to
consider
which
of
the
severn
jewels
would
be
the
most
appropriate
to
offer
to
the
young
lady
in
token
of
welcome
into
that
august
family
simple
would
be
more
suitable
in
the
first
place
of
course
once
she
is
married
she
will
have
her
proper
share
of
all
as
the
wife
of
the
head
of
the
so
lady
severn
amused
herself
feeling
most
amiably
disposed
to
the
imaginary
miss
cunningham
whom
before
long
she
came
to
think
of
with
very
different
feelings
but
both
her
goodwill
and
resentment
were
kept
to
herself
poor
lady
as
ralph
exacted
from
her
a
promise
that
the
little
she
knew
of
his
mysteriously
unfortunate
love
affairs
should
be
kept
to
herself
and
as
he
never
became
more
communicative
on
the
subject
sir
niece
was
anathematized
in
the
private
recesses
of
lady
heart
only
but
this
is
anticipating
sir
ralph
left
for
london
the
morning
after
his
conversation
with
his
mother
he
had
to
drive
some
distance
before
meeting
the
railway
which
as
i
said
had
not
yet
penetrated
into
the
pretty
little
county
where
the
family
had
taken
up
their
quarters
for
the
summer
so
he
hired
a
and
got
through
the
first
twenty
miles
briskly
enough
then
it
became
necessary
to
change
horses
the
roads
being
hilly
and
expedition
indispensable
to
his
catching
the
scotch

at
the
nearest
point
on
its

than
an
time
quoth
mine
host
of

at
which
charioteer

proper
to
make
the
enquiry

obliged
to
catch
the

at

junction
at
four
he
said
doubtfully
enough
and
plenty
for
that
sir
said
landlord
and
ostler
in
a
breath
if
you
start
from
here
till
two
and
now
only
on
the
stroke
of
the
grey
and
the
bay

added
the
landlord
think
nothing
of
taking
a
trap
like
this
that
far
in
a
hour
and
a
quarter
give
the
gentleman
time
to
lunch
and
look
about
him
a
bit
he
continued
as
ralph
on
hearing
his
assurance
prepared
to
alight
thought
worth
coming
a
good
bit
to
see
sir
is
the
peacock

among
us
father
and
son
with
now
then
brothers
and
nephews
to
help
like
in
the
way
of

years
and
never
without
a
bed
to
make
up
and
summer
alike
sir
those
as

their
way
to
the
peacock

not
to
say
three
times
and
fower
a
gentleman

sir
at
present

real
gentleman
not
a
artist
as

for
the
fishin

sir
be
few
summers
and
far
between
as
see
him
and
his
lady
at
the
peacock
couple
he
reason
of
which
it
is
that
one
of
the
pair
has
had
to
be
shod
this
morning
lady
or
the
gentleman
asked
ralph
but
the
landlord
did
not
catch
his
words
baldwin
he
continued
them
a
longish
drive
yesterday
to
show
his
lady
some
of
the
sights
of
the
neighbourhood
off
again
this
morning
to
fetch
the
letters
from
bexley
village
a
active
gentleman
very
the
young
a
trifle
delicate
in
health
i
fancy
reading
in
the
arbour
this
morning
been
a
week
and
more
at
the
peacock
and
no
word
of
them
going
as
said
ralph
who
being
in
the
possession
of
pleasant
hopes
could
listen
with
patience
to
the
worthy
communications
even
to
his
mention
of
the
young
couple
who
found
the
peacock
so
charming
what
is
the
meaning
of
the
name
of
your
place
the
peacock
you
call
it
but
on
the
i
saw
something
which
looked
more
like
a
tree
or
bush
as
i
glanced
at
they
were
by
this
time
inside
the
house
enough
sir
replied
the
man
peacock
is
a
bush
sir
one
of
the
kind
sir
you
know
cut
for
to
look
like
a
peacock
it
stands
in
the
middle
of
the
grass
plot
at
the
side
of
the
house
near
the
arbour
you
miss
it
if
you
take
a
turn
that
way
all
complete
somewhat
to
the
right
of
the
plot
sir
tail
and
all
it
takes
some
trouble
the
and
it
in
shape
but
quite
a
will
you
take
a
turn
sir
while
getting
ready
a
little
something
in
the
way
of
lunch
chops
veal
cutlets
roast
you
please
sir
ralph
was
just
the
sort
of
man
who
could
not
for
the
life
of
him
order
his
own
dinner
he
always
when
put
to
it
as
in
the
present
instance
fell
back
upon
this
the
landlord
undertook
to
have
speedily
prepared
it
was
ready
a
good
while
before
ralph
returned
to
eat
it
as
his
host
suggested
he
sauntered
out
into
the
garden
a
real
garden
of
the
good
sort
seen
too
to
the
greatest
perfection
on
this
hot
sweet
sunny
day
what
air
there
was
came
laden
with
breath
of
roses
and
mignonette
and
all
of
which
with
their
less
fragrant
but
not
less
lovely
and
all
the
dear
old
friends
we
see
so
seldom
flourished
in
rare
beauty
and
abundance
in
the
neat
little
borders
with
their
trim
box
edges
round
all
sides
of
the
smooth
lawn
or
grass
plot
as
its
landlord
had
been
content
to
call
it
more
than
once
ralph
stopped
in
his
stroll
to
bury
his
face
in
some
peculiarly
tempting
rose
or
to
pass
his
hand
caressingly
over
the
rich
soft
velvet
of
an
appealing
pansy
at
his
feet
a
sweet
place
he
thought
to
himself
what
a
perfect
day
just
the
place
to
make
love
so
too
thought
his
only
companion
in
the
garden
a
young
girl
half
lying
half
sitting
in
the
arbour
whom
as
yet
he
had
not
observed
served
nor
had
he
so
far
been
perceived
by
her
marion
for
she
it
was
had
been
spending
the
morning
in
a
very
idle
fashion
with
a
book
in
her
hand
but
not
reading
in
a
half
dream
of
sweet
summer
fancies
subdued
to
pensiveness
if
not
to
melancholy
as
was
all
about
her
by
the
shadows
of
the
past
but
tinged
and
brightened
nevertheless
by
the
gentle
sunshine
of
peace
and
affection
which
was
gradually
stealing
into
her
life
she
was
growing
happier
there
was
no
doubt
as
she
sat
in
the
arbour
that
morning
in
dreamy
restfulness
she
acknowledged
this
to
herself
it
might
be
to
some
extent
the
sweet
summer
influences
about
flowers
and
the
sunshine
and
that
loveliest
of
summer
sounds
the
soft
musical
mysterious
around
and
yet
far
the
myriads
of
busy
happy
insects
rejoicing
in
their
life
it
might
to
some
extent
come
from
these
influences
for
her
nature
was
intensely
exquisitely
sensitive
and
impressionable
but
however
this
may
have
been
the
result
was
the
same
the
thoughts
in
her
heart
were
full
of
gratitude
and
gentle
gladness
as
she
murmured
to
herself
softly
thank
god
that
i
am
growing
happier
the
past
has
not
crushed
me
so
utterly
as
i
thought
my
youth
has
not
altogether
left
me
i
have
suffered
god
knows
how
i
have
suffered
but
i
thank
him
that
the
memory
of
it
is
beginning
to
fade
in
the
light
of
the
peaceful
to
some
natures
means
more
than
to
others
there
are
plants
that
can
not
live
without
sunshine
marion
was
one
of
these
happiness
to
her
meant
capability
of
strength
and
heart
to
fill
her
place
in
the
world
and
do
her
work
there
are
some
grandest
of
us
whom
it
is
given
bravely
to
endure
to
the
end
with
no
hope
on
this
side
the
grave
to
do
their
task
thoroughly
though
it
is
all
working
in
the
dark
with
no
prospect
of
light
save
the
fitful
gleam
that
but
seldom
reaches
the
wearied
eyes
from
across
the
depths
of
the
dark
river
itself
but
my
poor
child
was
not
of
these
she
was
strong
in
a
sense
stronger
and
deeper
than
most
of
her
sex
but
without
some
sunshine
she
must
have
withered
and
died
she
felt
instinctively
that
so
it
was
with
her
and
there
was
more
far
more
than
the
selfish
cry
of
relief
from
pain
in
her
deep
thankfulness
for
the
light
beginning
again
as
she
thought
however
feebly
to
glimmer
on
her
path
but
as
she
was
thinking
thus
gazing
out
on
the
brightness
and
beauty
around
her
a
shadow
came
between
her
and
the
sun
and
the
warmth
and
light
flooding
in
through
the
narrow
door
of
the
rustic
arbour
were
suddenly
intercepted
a
dark
figure
stood
before
her
her
eyes
were
somewhat
dazzled
by
the
sunshine
and
she
did
not
for
a
moment
see
distinctly
the
could
see
it
was
a
with
his
back
to
her
it
was
ralph
of
course
he
was
amusing
himself
with
trying
from
different
points
of
view
to
discover
the
fancied
resemblance
of
the
old
yew
in
the
centre
of
the
green
to
a
peacock
with
outspread
tail
from
where
he
now
stood
some
weird
resemblance
of
the
kind
was
perceptible
the
arbour
was
deep
and
from
the
outside
looked
dark
and
cavernous
utterly
forgetful
of
the
mention
of
the
young
occupancy
of
it
he
stood
at
the
doorway
unceremoniously
blocking
out
the
light
and
when
at
last
he
turned
and
glanced
inwards
he
did
not
for
an
instant
perceive
that
it
was
not
tenantless
then
the
flutter
of
a
light
dress
revealed
the
presence
of
its
owner
with
a
hasty
exclamation
of
apology
for
his
intrusion
ralph
was
turning
away
when
a
was
it
could
never
cry
of
distress
an
appeal
to
him
by
name
or
only
an
inarticulate
him
the
lady
in
the
arbour
stood
up
and
approached
him
gazing
at
him
fixedly
shading
her
eyes
with
her
hand
from
the
glare
of
light
surrounding
him
as
he
hastily
stepped
forward
to
meet
her
something
in
her
figure
first
struck
him
as
familiar
something
slight
and
indescribable
before
he
had
time
to
look
again
at
her
see
the
hand
drop
powerlessly
by
her
to
recognize
her
he
was
on
his
way
to
lost
love
marion
vere
in
his
glad
surprise
all
else
faded
from
his
mind
i
dreaming
he
exclaimed
it
you
your
very
self
marion
my
darling
speak
to
and
he
seemed
as
if
he
were
about
to
seize
her
hand
and
draw
her
towards
him
but
she
turned
coldly
in
an
instant
regaining
her
which
in
the
first
moments
of
amazement
had
deserted
her
ralph
she
said
can
not
understand
how
it
is
you
are
here
but
i
do
not
want
to
see
or
speak
to
you
go
away
i
beg
of
you
and
do
not
ask
me
to
answer
you
but
almost
before
she
had
finished
the
few
cold
strange
words
he
interrupted
her
wonder
you
are
indignant
with
me
heaven
only
knows
what
i
must
have
seemed
to
deserve
you
to
think
of
me
but
listen
to
my
explanation
you
must
marion
you
shall
he
exclaimed
vehemently
as
she
was
endeavouring
to
pass
him
and
mechanically
she
obeyed
she
was
not
frightened
but
the
old
influence
was
at
work
already
she
could
not
resist
his
determination
that
he
should
be
heard
she
sank
on
the
seat
beside
her
and
he
stood
there
in
the
doorway
the
sunlight
pouring
in
round
him
while
with
earnest
voice
and
the
words
of
a
full
heart
he
told
his
tale
rapidly
and
unhesitatingly
he
went
over
all
we
have
heard
already
the
reason
of
his
former
hesitation
the
success
of
his
journey
to
england
the
bitter
disappointment
awaiting
him
on
his
return
to
altes
the
long
string
of
mistakes
and
up
to
the
last
extraordinary
revelation
contained
in
overlooked
letter
she
did
not
interrupt
him
by
word
or
gesture
so
he
went
on
to
tell
of
his
delight
of
the
revulsion
to
joy
from
the
depths
of
utter
hopelessness
the
increased
love
and
devotion
wrought
in
him
by
the
knowledge
of
all
she
had
done
and
suffered
above
all
by
the
explanation
of
her
poor
little
innocent
secret
which
she
his
poor
darling
as
he
called
her
again
had
dreaded
his
knowing
then
he
stopped
for
a
second
time
but
still
she
did
not
answer
is
right
now
he
said
while
yet
his
heart
throbbed
faster
from
some
strange
unacknowledged
is
right
now
he
repeated
mother
waiting
eagerly
to
receive
you
as
a
daughter
marion
my
dearest
have
i
startled
you
you
look
paler
and
thinner
than
you
were
i
am
a
brute
not
to
have
thought
of
it
you
have
been
forgive
my
roughness
i
implore
you
but
do
not
punish
me
in
this
dreadful
way
by
refusing
to
look
up
or
answer
me
speak
to
me
my
darling
i
beseech
then
at
last
she
spoke
but
in
a
dull
dead
voice
and
without
raising
her
eyes
from
the
sanded
floor
of
the
little
on
which
she
was
gazing
as
if
she
would
print
it
on
her
brain
she
only
said
without
the
slightest
expression
or
inflection
in
her
thought
you
were
married
i
thought
you
were
married
to
florence
he
almost
laughed
in
the
momentary
relief
i
was
to
florence
vyse
whoever
told
you
so
and
how
could
you
have
believed
it
it
must
have
been
some
absurd
confusion
of
the
news
of
her
marriage
which
is
to
take
place
shortly
true
enough
but
the
bridegroom
elect
is
chepstow
not
me
oh
marion
you
really
believe
it
i
did
she
replied
still
in
the
same
dead
tone
did
believe
it
thoroughly
so
thoroughly
that
it
nearly
killed
my
darling
he
groaned
i
am
right
you
have
been
very
ill
i
feared
it
but
now
it
is
all
right
now
if
indeed
my
whole
devotion
can
do
so
i
will
make
up
to
you
for
all
the
miserable
past
why
why
did
you
doubt
me
my
love
my
darling
you
knew
at
least
if
i
could
not
marry
you
i
should
choose
no
other
woman
but
it
is
cruel
to
reproach
and
useless
for
it
is
all
right
and
again
he
made
as
if
he
would
draw
her
to
his
arms
but
she
put
out
her
hands
before
her
as
if
in
appeal
she
said
ralph
you
have
not
heard
all
yet
remember
it
is
a
year
since
that
letter
was
written
truly
it
is
useless
to
reproach
me
or
anyone
now
how
shall
i
tell
him
have
not
heard
all
ralph
it
is
not
all
right
but
fearfully
unchangeably
wrong
ralph
i
am
married
a
sound
as
of
a
great
gasping
sob
of
despair
then
a
voice
she
would
not
have
known
for
him
said
fortnight
she
replied
as
if
she
were
repeating
a
lesson
learnt
by
rote
fortnight
i
was
counting
how
long
it
was
as
i
was
sitting
here
before
you
came
and
i
remember
i
said
to
myself
was
yesterday
fortnight
otherwise
i
could
not
remember
now
this
is
thursday
and
it
was
on
a
wednesday
i
am
not
marion
vere
now
his
name
is
he
is
my
husband
and
i
promised
to
love
him
oh
god
forgive
me
what
is
this
thing
that
i
have
done
what
is
this
awful
punishment
that
has
come
upon
me
and
she
crouched
lower
down
on
the
rough
bench
on
which
she
was
sitting
and
buried
her
face
in
her
hands
chapter
ii
the
bitterness
of
death
love
part
thus
was
it
not
well
to
speak
to
have
spoken
once
it
could
not
but
be
well
o
then
like
those
who
clench
their
nerves
to
rush
upon
their
dissolution
we
two
rose
like
an
individual
in
one
blind
cry
of
passion
and
of
pain
like
bitter
accusation
to
death
caught
up
the
whole
of
love
and
it
and
bade
adieu
for
love
and
duty
there
was
a
terrible
silence
in
the
little
arbour
outside
in
the
garden
the
sun
and
the
flowers
the
birds
and
the
insects
went
on
with
their
song
of
rejoicing
as
before
but
it
reached
no
longer
the
ears
of
the
two
human
beings
who
but
now
had
it
in
their
hearts
was
it
hours
or
only
minutes
that
it
lasted
silence
as
of
death
at
last
ralph
spoke
very
quietly
that
though
marion
could
not
see
his
face
his
voice
made
her
start
with
a
strange
unknown
terror
who
did
this
thing
he
asked
forced
you
into
this
hideous
mockery
of
a
marriage
one
she
replied
one
did
it
but
myself
you
understand
ralph
and
the
anguish
of
appeal
and
remorse
in
her
voice
made
it
sound
like
a
wailing
cry
can
never
know
all
i
have
endured
i
was
so
wretched
so
very
wretched
so
utterly
utterly
desolate
and
alone
and
then
i
heard
that
of
you
and
i
lost
my
trust
and
it
nearly
killed
me
your
own
words
had
warned
me
not
to
build
too
securely
on
what
might
be
beyond
your
power
to
ralph
ground
his
teeth
but
she
went
on
thought
i
was
going
to
die
and
i
was
glad
but
i
did
not
die
and
he
was
kind
and
gentle
to
me
and
i
was
alone
and
i
i
thought
ralph
till
this
very
morning
that
i
had
torn
you
out
of
my
heart
the
scar
i
knew
would
be
always
there
but
the
love
itself
i
thought
it
was
dead
and
buried
and
only
just
now
i
sat
here
thinking
to
myself
in
my
blindness
and
folly
that
i
could
even
see
the
grass
be
ginning
to
grow
on
the
your
husband
ralph
asked
in
the
same
dead
hard
feelingless
tone
forget
the
name
you
told
you
then
care
for
him
do
you
love
him
him
she
exclaimed
ralph
have
mercy
i
did
not
mean
to
deceive
him
i
told
him
i
could
not
give
him
what
he
gave
me
for
he
i
know
loves
me
he
is
good
and
true
and
very
kind
to
me
and
he
urged
it
very
much
and
said
he
was
not
afraid
he
would
be
content
with
what
i
said
what
i
thought
i
could
give
him
for
remember
ralph
that
other
i
thought
was
and
buried
for
ever
i
care
for
him
too
much
to
have
yielded
had
i
known
it
was
not
so
but
him
when
i
think
of
the
days
when
first
i
learnt
what
that
word
means
when
you
taught
it
me
and
no
other
and
now
you
ask
me
calmly
if
i
love
him
you
of
all
she
stopped
suddenly
as
if
horrified
at
herself
and
then
her
excitement
changed
to
bitter
shame
and
she
cried
in
an
anguish
what
am
i
saying
why
has
it
all
come
back
when
i
thought
it
was
gone
you
are
making
me
wicked
to
geoffrey
ralph
ralph
why
do
you
mock
me
with
these
cruel
questions
have
mercy
have
a
little
mercy
said
ralph
turning
from
the
on
which
he
had
been
leaning
and
rising
to
his
full
height
as
he
spoke
standing
right
in
front
of
her
and
with
a
strange
change
in
his
voice
you
ask
yes
child
i
will
have
mercy
mercy
on
you
and
on
myself
who
have
done
nothing
either
of
us
deserving
of
this
hideous
torment
you
are
you
tell
to
another
i
tell
you
you
are
not
that
was
a
blasphemous
mockery
of
a
marriage
i
am
your
husband
i
and
no
other
you
are
mine
marion
and
no
one
my
wife
my
own
come
away
with
me
child
now
this
very
moment
and
have
done
at
once
and
for
ever
with
this
horrible
that
is
killing
me
for
i
can
not
lose
you
again
oh
my
god
i
can
not
and
as
he
spoke
he
tried
to
draw
her
towards
him
not
gently
but
roughly
violently
almost
in
sore
passion
of
anguish
which
was
enraging
him
hitherto
since
he
had
begun
to
speak
marion
had
allowed
him
to
hold
her
clasped
hand
in
his
but
now
as
she
felt
the
hold
of
his
fingers
tighten
and
as
the
full
meaning
of
his
wild
mad
words
broke
upon
her
with
a
sudden
movement
she
rose
from
the
bench
on
which
she
was
sitting
and
tore
herself
from
his
grasp
growing
at
the
same
moment
as
if
by
magic
perfectly
icily
calm
but
only
for
an
instant
did
her
instinct
of
indignation
against
him
last
one
glance
at
the
dark
passionate
face
beside
changed
so
terribly
sadly
changed
in
its
expression
from
its
usual
calm
gentle
her
mood
softened
she
laid
her
hand
trustingly
on
his
arm
she
said
ralph
hush
if
you
are
for
a
moment
weak
i
must
be
strong
for
both
this
is
terrible
that
has
come
upon
terrible
that
just
now
i
do
not
see
that
i
can
bear
it
and
live
for
you
know
all
my
heart
and
you
can
judge
if
it
is
not
to
the
full
as
terrible
for
me
as
for
this
she
said
in
her
innocent
instinct
of
appealing
to
his
pity
for
her
at
least
are
bound
by
no
vows
to
another
and
that
other
alas
so
good
and
kind
i
had
rather
ten
thousand
times
rather
he
were
hard
and
unloving
and
cruel
but
though
just
now
i
can
see
nothing
else
this
one
thing
i
see
must
go
ralph
you
must
leave
me
now
at
once
and
we
must
never
never
see
each
other
again
there
is
just
one
little
glimpse
of
light
left
in
the
thought
that
hitherto
we
have
neither
of
us
done
anything
to
forfeit
the
indeed
that
deceit
of
mine
no
she
added
glancing
at
his
face
know
you
have
not
thought
worse
of
me
for
that
do
not
let
us
destroy
this
poor
little
rag
of
comfort
left
us
ralph
let
me
still
think
of
you
as
good
and
as
the
best
and
bravest
and
do
not
tempt
me
ralph
to
say
at
this
terrible
moment
what
in
calmer
times
might
cause
me
shame
and
remorse
to
and
she
raised
her
face
to
his
with
a
very
agony
of
appeal
in
the
grey
eyes
he
loved
so
fervently
he
said
still
with
the
hard
look
on
his
face
are
you
an
angel
or
a
stone
have
you
a
heart
or
have
you
none
if
after
all
you
are
just
like
other
women
utterly
incapable
of
entering
into
the
depths
a
one
love
at
least
you
should
pity
what
you
can
not
understand
instead
of
maddening
me
with
that
conventional
humbug
about
mutual
respect
and
so
on
who
but
a
woman
would
talk
so
at
such
a
time
but
i
will
do
as
you
wish
he
went
on
lashing
himself
into
fury
against
her
will
not
stay
here
longer
to
tempt
you
by
my
evil
presence
to
outrage
your
delicate
sense
of
propriety
or
to
say
one
word
which
hereafter
you
might
consider
it
had
not
been
perfectly
or
to
utter
good
god
what
a
fool
i
have
been
i
had
imagined
you
somewhat
different
from
other
women
but
i
see
my
mistake
it
shall
be
as
you
wish
good
bye
you
shall
not
again
be
distressed
by
the
sight
of
me
truly
you
do
well
to
despise
and
with
a
bitter
sneer
in
his
voice
he
turned
away
it
was
at
last
too
much
the
girl
threw
herself
down
recklessly
on
the
rough
she
shed
no
tears
she
was
not
the
sort
of
woman
to
weep
in
such
dire
extremity
of
anguish
she
shook
and
quivered
as
she
lay
there
but
that
was
all
but
soon
the
thought
came
over
her
it
not
better
so
better
that
ralph
should
thus
cruelly
misjudge
her
for
in
the
end
it
might
help
him
to
forget
her
forget
this
was
what
she
must
now
pray
for
if
her
love
for
him
were
worthy
of
the
name
but
he
might
have
said
gently
broke
forth
again
from
the
heart
might
have
spoken
kindly
when
it
was
for
the
last
last
as
the
wish
crossed
her
thoughts
and
she
half
unconsciously
murmured
it
in
words
she
felt
that
some
one
was
beside
her
an
arm
raised
her
gently
and
replaced
her
on
the
seat
it
was
ralph
again
something
in
his
touch
soothed
and
quieted
her
she
did
not
this
time
shrink
from
him
in
alarm
but
for
a
moment
leant
her
throbbing
head
restfully
on
his
shoulder
my
poor
child
marion
my
lost
darling
forgive
you
ralph
yes
a
thousand
times
yes
she
replied
do
not
so
grievously
misjudge
me
it
is
no
conventional
humbug
as
you
call
it
it
is
the
old
plain
question
of
right
and
as
she
said
the
words
there
flashed
across
her
was
it
some
mocking
imp
that
whispered
it
remembrance
of
some
other
scene
when
this
same
phrase
plain
question
of
right
and
wrong
had
been
used
by
herself
or
another
when
was
it
ah
yes
long
long
ago
the
first
morning
in
the
little
house
at
altes
she
recalled
it
all
perfectly
the
room
in
which
they
sat
the
position
of
their
chairs
and
she
heard
voice
saying
timidly
pretend
to
be
as
wise
as
you
may
but
are
you
quite
sure
there
is
not
a
plain
question
of
right
and
wrong
in
the
matter
and
to
add
to
her
misery
the
thought
darted
into
her
if
she
had
then
allowed
herself
to
see
it
thus
if
instead
of
acting
as
she
had
done
to
screen
him
she
had
encouraged
harry
bravely
to
appeal
to
her
father
how
different
might
all
have
been
this
terrible
complication
avoided
her
life
and
saved
from
this
irremediable
agony
could
it
indeed
be
that
this
terrible
punishment
had
come
upon
her
for
this
well
for
us
is
it
truly
that
our
sins
and
mistakes
are
not
judged
as
in
such
times
of
morbid
misery
and
exaggerated
self
reproach
we
are
apt
to
imagine
the
remembrance
of
that
bygone
scene
at
altes
flashed
through
mind
in
an
instant
but
not
too
quickly
to
add
its
sting
to
her
suffering
and
half
mechanically
she
repeated
the
old
plain
question
of
right
and
know
it
is
said
ralph
i
knew
it
in
my
heart
when
you
just
now
said
it
i
was
mad
i
think
doubly
mad
first
to
torture
you
with
my
wild
wicked
words
and
then
to
turn
upon
you
with
my
sneers
so
i
have
come
back
to
you
for
a
moment
just
for
one
little
last
moment
child
to
ask
you
to
forgive
me
and
say
goodbye
look
up
at
me
dear
and
let
me
see
that
you
forgive
she
looked
up
at
him
looked
with
her
true
clear
eyes
into
his
while
he
gazed
down
on
with
what
an
agony
of
earnestness
as
if
he
would
burn
her
face
into
his
brain
for
ever
for
a
moment
neither
spoke
then
he
said
is
as
if
one
of
us
were
dying
marion
though
that
i
think
would
be
easy
to
bear
compared
with
this
bitterness
of
they
talk
of
all
they
little
know
my
own
true
darling
my
one
love
my
and
as
he
said
the
words
he
stooped
and
kissed
but
long
and
fervently
on
the
forehead
poor
ralph
it
was
the
first
time
was
it
wrong
of
her
to
allow
it
those
who
think
so
may
judge
her
and
i
for
one
shall
not
argue
it
with
them
she
stood
with
bent
head
motionless
staring
at
the
ground
but
seeing
nothing
then
she
looked
up
hastily
with
eyes
for
the
first
time
blinded
with
burning
tears
tears
that
bring
no
relief
wrung
from
the
sore
agony
of
a
bleeding
heart
but
he
was
gone
and
so
old
old
was
over
for
ever
for
these
two
as
for
how
many
others
whose
suffering
is
never
suspected
ralph
walked
back
slowly
to
the
inn
along
the
very
garden
path
which
before
half
a
lifetime
it
seemed
to
him
he
had
paced
so
the
same
little
stiff
he
had
noticed
before
the
same
scent
from
the
roses
and
honeysuckle
the
same
sun
and
sky
and
air
then
he
remembered
he
had
said
to
himself
it
was
all
sweet
and
bright
and
fair
could
he
have
said
so
was
the
change
in
himself
only
it
indeed
be
he
asked
as
we
all
do
at
these
awful
times
beating
our
poor
bruised
wings
against
the
bars
of
the
inexorable
it
be
that
nature
should
remain
thus
unmoved
and
indifferent
when
human
beings
were
riven
in
agony
and
a
feeling
of
intensest
disgust
amounting
almost
to
rage
seized
him
at
the
sight
of
the
hateful
heartless
beautiful
world
but
when
he
found
this
mood
coming
over
him
he
checked
it
violently
shall
go
mad
he
thought
i
yield
to
this
just
now
i
must
not
think
of
my
part
of
it
yet
time
enough
for
that
time
enough
surely
in
the
desolation
of
the
long
years
stretching
away
before
and
he
writhed
at
the
thought
can
i
do
he
asked
himself
can
i
do
to
lighten
it
to
her
or
to
strengthen
her
to
bear
it
oh
my
darling
my
darling
i
that
would
have
sheltered
you
from
sorrow
as
never
yet
woman
was
sheltered
and
to
think
that
of
all
living
beings
on
this
earth
i
am
the
one
who
must
ever
to
you
be
less
than
nothing
but
i
am
maddening
myself
a
sudden
idea
struck
him
he
thought
should
like
to
see
him
one
glance
at
his
face
would
give
me
a
better
notion
of
him
than
anything
i
could
gather
by
hearsay
and
it
will
be
a
sort
of
satisfaction
to
know
in
whose
hands
my
poor
future
but
on
thinking
it
over
he
remembered
that
actually
he
had
heard
and
asked
nothing
about
this
same
in
the
absorbing
personal
interest
of
his
interview
with
marion
he
had
forgotten
all
but
themselves
whom
she
had
married
what
his
station
where
they
had
utterly
unknown
to
him
nor
indeed
if
she
had
attempted
to
tell
would
he
have
cared
to
listen
all
in
that
first
bitter
bewildering
agony
was
to
him
comprised
in
the
fact
that
she
did
in
truth
belong
to
another
he
walked
on
slowly
through
the
garden
the
hot
sun
beating
on
his
head
trying
as
he
went
to
recall
the
name
which
he
half
fancied
had
been
once
mentioned
by
marion
but
in
vain
when
he
got
to
the
house
he
was
seized
upon
by
the
landlord
and
obliged
to
listen
to
a
long
string
of
apologies
for
the
state
of
the
unfortunate
chop
various
emissaries
had
been
despatched
it
appeared
to
inform
him
that
his
in
the
way
of
was
ready
but
had
all
failed
in
their
mission
sir
as
you
would
have
strolled
beyond
the
garden
which
as
being
so
you
must
please
replied
poor
ralph
feeling
that
indeed
his
cup
had
not
been
full
if
he
were
now
to
be
called
upon
to
partake
of
this
wretched
chop
in
the
presence
of
landlord
waiters
and
stable
boys
as
appeared
to
be
their
intention
but
he
succeeded
in
dismissing
them
and
thankful
for
silence
and
solitude
sat
down
to
his
semblance
of
a
meal
in
the
little
parlour
opening
out
of
the
hall
while
eating
or
making
a
pretence
of
so
doing
he
kept
his
mind
directed
to
the
consideration
of
his
present
object
a
sight
for
himself
of
the
the
husband
who
possessed
for
him
so
strange
an
interest
after
a
time
he
rang
the
bell
intending
to
enter
into
conversation
with
the
waiter
and
to
gather
from
him
indirectly
the
information
he
sought
in
the
meantime
however
a
new
arrival
had
distracted
the
attention
of
the
household
of
the
peacock
and
his
summons
was
not
at
once
obeyed
while
waiting
he
turned
to
the
window
and
stared
out
vacantly
as
we
so
often
do
when
utterly
indifferent
to
all
passing
around
us
but
indifference
was
not
of
long
duration
a
carriage
drove
into
the
little
drew
up
at
the
door
and
a
gentleman
out
in
a
boyish
fashion
hardly
waiting
till
the
horse
had
stopped
he
was
smoking
and
had
several
letters
in
his
hand
one
of
which
he
appeared
to
be
in
the
act
of
reading
he
stood
still
for
a
moment
then
sauntered
leisurely
into
the
porch
and
remained
there
while
he
finished
the
perusal
of
his
letter
it
was
geoffrey
from
where
ralph
stood
at
the
parlour
window
he
had
an
excellent
view
of
the
young
man
whom
he
no
sooner
caught
sight
of
than
he
felt
an
intuitive
conviction
that
here
before
him
was
husband
geoffrey
for
a
wonder
was
in
a
thoughtful
mood
or
looked
so
at
least
as
he
stood
there
reading
his
letter
under
the
shade
of
the
honeysuckle
and
clematis
climbing
over
the
porch
the
sunlight
between
the
branches
falling
softly
on
his
bright
brown
hair
a
pleasant
picture
truly
and
so
ralph
owned
to
himself
as
he
looked
at
him
the
tall
manly
figure
the
fair
almost
boyish
face
made
an
attractive
whole
it
was
a
strange
position
the
two
men
as
to
years
nearly
of
an
age
but
in
all
else
so
marvellously
dissimilar
and
yet
though
utter
strangers
to
each
other
with
the
one
absorbing
interest
in
common
ralph
from
his
concealment
gazed
at
the
young
man
standing
in
perfect
unconsciousness
full
in
his
view
as
if
he
would
read
every
smallest
characteristic
every
hidden
feeling
of
his
heart
never
did
anxious
mother
scan
more
narrowly
the
man
to
whom
she
was
asked
to
confide
her
happiness
than
did
ralph
the
countenance
of
his
unconscious
rival
the
being
who
had
robbed
him
of
all
that
made
life
worth
having
just
then
some
one
from
within
came
to
the
door
and
spoke
to
geoffrey
it
was
only
a
servant
with
some
trivial
message
but
ralph
still
watching
earnestly
noticed
the
gentle
courtesy
the
smile
sunnying
over
the
clear
honest
eyes
and
mouth
the
frank
bright
readiness
with
which
the
young
man
looked
up
and
answered
then
refolding
the
letter
he
had
been
reading
replaced
it
in
his
pocket
and
sauntered
away
in
an
opposite
direction
thought
ralph
am
satisfied
she
spoke
truly
he
is
and
true
and
and
attractive
too
personally
very
most
women
would
not
find
it
difficult
to
love
that
man
but
then
alas
my
poor
child
is
not
like
most
women
come
what
may
however
i
think
that
man
will
ever
be
unkind
to
her
heaven
knows
i
am
not
vain
but
it
would
be
nonsense
to
pretend
to
myself
that
i
think
she
will
ever
come
to
feel
for
him
good
fellow
though
i
doubt
he
is
what
i
know
she
has
felt
for
me
but
yet
in
time
and
when
totally
separated
from
all
associations
connected
with
me
i
trust
a
sort
of
moonlight
happiness
may
yet
be
in
store
for
here
reflections
were
interrupted
by
the
tardy
entrance
of
the
servant
who
waited
to
receive
his
orders
soon
will
the
horses
be
ready
asked
he
you
please
sir
replied
the
man
a
quarter
of
an
hour
at
most
your
carriage
can
be
well
said
ralph
can
order
it
to
come
round
in
twenty
minutes
from
now
in
the
meantime
bring
me
pens
and
ink
and
paper
as
i
have
a
letter
to
write
adding
as
the
man
was
leaving
the
room
who
is
the
gentleman
that
drove
in
just
now
baldwin
sir
comes
from
brentshire
i
believe
the
maid
does
baldwin
is
here
too
sir
a
in
the
garden
she
is
i
believe
were
you
wishing
to
speak
to
baldwin
sir
he
has
just
stepped
round
to
look
at
a
horse
which
the
ostler
was
thinking
might
carry
the
lady
while
here
but
i
can
run
after
him
if
so
be
you
wish
to
see
him
oh
dear
no
not
at
all
replied
ralph
who
began
to
think
a
more
appropriate
sign
for
the
little
inn
would
have
been
be
so
good
as
bring
in
the
writing
materials
at
when
they
were
brought
he
sat
down
and
wrote
quickly
and
unhesitatingly
as
if
perfectly
prepared
with
what
he
had
to
say
his
letter
folded
and
directed
he
sauntered
out
into
the
garden
again
just
a
chance
he
thought
i
may
get
it
unobserved
into
her
own
hands
otherwise
i
must
post
it
which
however
i
would
much
prefer
not
to
looking
about
he
spied
a
small
boy
busy
weeding
he
called
the
child
to
him
and
led
him
to
the
top
of
the
long
narrow
path
at
the
end
of
which
was
the
green
with
the
peacock
bush
in
the
centre
and
the
old
arbour
at
the
side
he
felt
no
doubt
that
marion
was
still
there
her
husband
fortunately
having
gone
to
the
stables
my
boy
said
he
as
fast
as
you
can
to
the
down
there
and
give
this
letter
to
the
lady
see
there
if
she
is
gone
bring
it
back
to
me
be
as
quick
as
you
can
and
have
a
shilling
ready
for
you
when
you
come
the
child
was
soon
back
again
the
lady
still
there
asked
ralph
sir
said
the
little
messenger
glowing
with
delight
at
the
thought
of
a
wages
so
easily
earned
sir
the
young
lady
were
there
and
she
said
you
and
would
i
give
this
to
the
gentleman
holding
out
a
little
turquoise
ring
as
he
spoke
a
simple
common
little
ring
enough
she
had
had
it
from
childhood
he
had
often
seen
it
on
her
little
finger
he
seized
it
eagerly
and
turned
away
then
recollecting
himself
he
gave
the
boy
the
promised
reward
thanked
him
quietly
and
returned
to
the
house
at
the
door
the
stood
waiting
and
in
another
minute
he
was
gone
thankful
at
last
to
feel
free
to
think
over
as
he
phrased
it
his
part
of
the
tragedy
think
of
it
did
he
ever
not
think
of
it
during
that
weary
day
and
night
and
many
a
weary
day
and
night
to
come
women
say
men
do
not
know
what
it
is
to
be
that
little
turquoise
ring
might
have
told
a
different
tale
wonder
thought
ralph
as
he
drove
along
on
his
solitary
hopeless
journey
wonder
what
she
will
think
it
right
to
do
she
said
her
part
was
the
worse
to
bear
i
fear
it
is
she
is
stronger
and
more
unselfish
than
most
women
but
on
the
other
hand
she
is
truthful
and
ingenuous
will
she
be
strong
enough
for
his
sake
to
leave
things
as
they
are
to
let
him
think
that
at
least
she
is
giving
him
no
less
than
she
promised
or
will
it
be
impossible
for
her
to
live
with
him
without
to
some
extent
confiding
in
him
even
though
by
so
doing
she
wrecks
for
the
time
at
least
his
happiness
poor
fellow
and
what
chance
she
has
of
any
herself
i
see
no
distinct
right
or
wrong
in
the
case
but
i
wonder
what
she
will
do
oh
if
i
could
have
saved
her
this
suffering
for
myself
i
can
bear
if
only
i
could
have
borne
it
all
my
burden
would
have
seemed
lighter
he
caught
the
express
at
bexley
and
went
on
in
it
to
london
for
no
reason
with
no
object
save
that
he
felt
it
would
be
a
relief
to
him
to
escape
the
unendurable
which
would
certainly
have
awaited
him
had
he
returned
straight
to
springs
late
in
the
evening
as
he
travelled
on
through
the
twilight
into
the
intense
darkness
of
a
midsummer
night
a
strange
feeling
came
over
him
bringing
with
it
a
faint
slight
breath
of
consolation
said
truly
he
thought
i
was
more
fortunate
than
she
in
that
i
am
free
and
unfettered
bound
by
no
uncongenial
ties
to
another
for
me
at
least
it
is
no
sin
to
love
her
still
for
i
know
it
is
not
in
my
nature
ever
to
replace
her
by
any
other
woman
and
who
knows
but
what
some
day
in
the
far
future
though
i
may
never
see
her
again
i
may
in
some
way
be
able
to
serve
her
to
lighten
the
lot
it
is
so
bitter
to
me
to
think
i
have
been
the
means
of
and
somehow
there
came
into
his
mind
the
remembrance
of
a
simple
little
german
ballad
that
years
and
years
ago
as
a
mere
boy
he
had
liked
and
been
struck
by
for
he
had
been
peculiar
as
a
morbid
and
sentimental
the
two
last
verses
rang
in
his
ears
that
night
over
and
over
again
he
heard
them
and
ever
after
they
were
associated
with
what
this
bitter
day
had
brought
to
pass
and
the
face
of
the
dead
maiden
on
the
bier
grew
to
him
like
that
of
his
own
lost
love
these
were
the
words
that
thus
haunted

in
from
london
a
day
or
two
later
he
wrote
to
his
mother
telling
her
simply
and
in
as
few
words
as
possible
that
the
hopes
he
had
confided
to
her
were
utterly
and
for
ever
at
an
end
he
begged
her
to
spare
him
the
pain
of
entering
into
useless
particulars
and
enjoined
her
never
if
she
valued
his
peace
and
comfort
to
allude
to
the
affair
directly
or
indirectly
to
him
or
anyone
else
lady
severn
obeyed
him
implicitly
and
only
in
the
recesses
of
her
own
heart
as
i
said
abused
for
the
sorrow
she
had
brought
upon
her
son
late
in
the
autumn
after
seeing
his
mother
and
nieces
comfortably
at
medhurst
and
assisting
at
the
gorgeous
nuptials
of
florence
vyse
and
chepstow
sir
ralph
left
england
for
an
indefinite
time
to
travel
in
strange
and
distant
lands
in
of
of
interest
and
occupation
sufficient
to
make
life
endurable

this
was
the
letter
the
little
boy
gave
to
the
young
lady
in
the
arbour
and
which
without
moving
from
her
seat
she
opened
and
read
it
was
addressed
outside
correctly
enough
to
it
was
the
first
letter
she
had
ever
received
from
ralph
she
read
it
slowly
though
it
was
short
enough
dwelling
on
each
phrase
each
word
with
the
sort
of
hungry
eagerness
with
which
we
strain
our
ears
to
catch
each
last
precious
whisper
from
loved
lips
which
we
know
shall
soon
very
soon
be
silent
for
ever
it
began
dearest
for
i
may
call
you
that
in
the
only
letter
i
shall
ever
write
to
you
i
said
just
now
it
was
as
if
one
of
us
were
you
try
to
receive
what
i
am
going
to
say
to
you
as
if
indeed
it
were
a
dying
request
it
may
seem
cruel
and
heartless
to
ask
it
just
now
but
it
is
my
last
chance
and
afterwards
though
you
may
reject
it
just
now
my
earnest
entreaty
may
come
back
to
your
mind
what
i
would
ask
of
you
my
poor
child
is
to
try
to
be
happy
for
the
sake
of
the
love
you
have
had
for
me
for
the
sake
of
the
love
you
well
know
i
have
for
you
let
me
leave
you
trusting
that
some
day
you
may
again
be
at
least
as
happy
as
you
were
today
when
i
so
rudely
destroyed
the
poor
little
fabric
you
had
begun
to
build
up
you
are
so
young
my
child
so
young
and
and
your
husband
you
tell
me
is
good
and
kind
i
have
seen
him
and
i
believe
he
is
so
happiness
can
not
but
to
some
extent
return
to
you
if
only
you
do
not
repel
it
by
dwelling
on
the
past
or
by
undeserved
let
me
trust
you
will
not
do
this
let
me
urge
on
you
with
more
earnestness
than
i
know
how
to
put
in
words
not
to
refuse
or
shut
out
from
you
the
sunshine
which
will
still
come
into
your
life
to
know
that
you
are
happy
is
the
one
remaining
great
wish
of
my
life
for
me
it
is
very
different
i
am
not
young
and
i
have
been
accustomed
to
live
alone
you
are
the
only
being
i
ever
took
into
my
life
and
i
must
now
return
to
the
old
loneliness
only
a
little
drearier
and
darker
than
before
for
having
known
one
short
blessed
glimpse
of
light
god
bless
you
my
dearest
and
lighten
to
you
the
terrible
trial
it
has
been
my
bitter
fate
to
bring
upon
you
leave
me
the
hope
that
some
day
you
may
be
able
to
think
of
me
without
suffering
forget
all
about
me
except
that
you
had
never
a
truer
friend
or
one
who
would
more
gladly
sacrifice
himself
to
ensure
your
than
she
read
it
slowly
and
quietly
no
one
observing
her
would
have
guessed
from
the
expression
of
her
face
that
its
contents
were
of
more
than
ordinary
interest
in
point
of
fact
she
hardly
as
yet
understood
it
she
was
still
stunned
and
bewildered
otherwise
it
is
probable
that
her
first
sensation
on
reading
letter
would
have
been
of
indignation
bitter
anger
at
him
for
daring
to
speak
to
her
of
such
a
mockery
as
for
thinking
it
possible
that
a
human
being
could
bear
such
torture
as
hers
and
live
but
as
yet
no
such
reflection
occurred
to
her
no
definite
thought
of
any
kind
was
at
present
possible
for
her
the
strength
which
had
enabled
her
to
think
and
decide
rightly
both
for
herself
and
ralph
had
already
deserted
her
she
was
literally
crushed
unable
even
to
realize
what
had
taken
place
in
a
dull
stupor
of
suffering
which
to
natures
like
hers
comes
instead
of
the
physical
unconsciousness
in
weaker
organisations
succeeding
to
extremity
of
nervous
tension
and
after
a
time
she
grew
chilly
and
the
sensation
roused
her
somewhat
to
a
consciousness
of
the
outer
world
she
wondered
why
she
shivered
and
trembled
with
cold
for
the
sun
was
still
shining
outside
and
all
looked
bright
and
warm
then
the
thought
occurred
to
her
that
soon
geoffrey
would
be
returning
from
bexley
and
she
wished
she
could
reach
her
room
unobserved
by
him
or
her
maid
once
there
it
would
be
easy
to
say
she
felt
ill
and
thus
obtain
some
quiet
and
solitude
in
which
to
brace
herself
for
what
lay
before
her
for
what
lay
before
her
she
repeated
to
herself
words
easy
to
say
but
in
her
case
what
did
they
mean
she
could
not
tell
could
not
even
attempt
to
consider
she
rose
from
her
seat
first
folding
and
concealing
the
precious
letter
and
began
slowly
to
walk
towards
the
house
her
steps
at
first
tottered
a
little
but
gradually
became
steadier
there
was
no
one
about
the
door
as
she
approached
it
so
she
took
courage
and
succeeded
in
gaining
her
own
room
without
meeting
any
one
but
a
stupid
unobservant
servant
or
two
who
noticed
nothing
unusual
in
her
appearance
she
looked
at
her
face
in
the
queer
toilet
glass
it
was
pale
as
death
and
her
lips
looked
blue
so
she
drank
some
water
and
drew
down
the
blinds
and
then
in
her
old
childish
fashion
threw
herself
down
on
the
side
of
the
bed
hiding
her
face
in
the
pillow
she
said
to
herself
i
will
begin
to
think
what
must
i
do
how
can
meet
geoffrey
what
ought
i
to
tell
him
hopeless
questions
unanswerable
at
least
by
the
poor
child
in
the
state
she
was
in
she
thought
it
all
over
again
and
again
that
strange
scene
in
the
garden
there
was
a
terrible
fascination
about
it
she
reminded
herself
of
every
word
he
had
uttered
every
glance
and
gesture
through
the
whole
of
the
interview
she
could
not
force
herself
to
think
of
anything
else
geoffrey
her
future
life
everything
but
this
one
remembrance
seemed
of
little
consequence
gradually
she
found
herself
thinking
of
it
all
as
if
it
had
happened
to
some
one
else
and
not
to
her
as
if
she
had
seen
it
acted
on
the
stage
or
read
it
in
a
book
and
then
she
seemed
to
have
known
it
always
it
was
nothing
arbour
and
the
flowers
and
the
sunshine
the
dark
figure
in
the
doorway
their
mutual
amazement
the
mingled
anguish
and
joy
of
their
meeting
the
agony
of
their
seemed
to
have
been
a
part
of
her
whole
life
she
had
never
been
separate
from
it
she
would
evermore
exist
in
the
thought
of
it
then
the
images
became
confused
she
was
no
longer
herself
but
some
one
else
who
she
could
not
decide
ralph
still
standing
in
the
doorway
grew
strangely
like
geoffrey
again
a
whole
was
a
dream
she
was
back
at
altes
with
cissy
and
ralph
on
the
terrace
and
ralph
was
smiling
on
her
lovingly
while
she
recounted
to
him
the
terrible
dream
that
had
visited
her
she
was
asleep
from
very
exhaustion
both
mental
and
physical
from
extremity
of
suffering
though
compressed
into
the
short
space
of
a
few
hours
she
was
for
the
time
laid
to
rest
in
the
peaceful
unconsciousness
which
though
the
waking
therefrom
may
be
bitter
is
yet
at
such
times
an
unspeakable
mercy
i
am
not
learned
in
medical
matters
but
i
believe
this
sleep
saved
her
from
a
brain
fever
or
worse
geoffrey
came
in
from
his
visit
to
the
stables
which
had
been
prolonged
beyond
his
intentions
not
finding
his
wife
in
the
little
appropriated
to
their
use
he
came
along
the
passage
to
seek
her
in
her
bedroom
he
was
not
a
light
stepper
and
his
boots
creaked
loudly
as
he
approached
the
room
but
the
sound
did
not
disturb
her
nor
did
his
tap
on
the
door
he
repeated
it
but
with
no
effect
then
imagining
she
must
be
in
the
garden
he
opened
the
door
merely
to
glance
in
and
satisfy
himself
as
to
her
absence
the
room
was
very
dark
all
the
blinds
drawn
down
and
a
general
air
of
sombreness
and
desertedness
no
there
was
her
hat
on
the
floor
and
a
glance
at
the
bed
revealed
herself
in
no
very
comfortable
attitude
just
as
she
had
flung
herself
down
but
fast
asleep
breathing
soft
and
regularly
as
an
infant
and
as
he
looked
more
closely
with
a
sweet
smile
on
her
lips
though
her
face
looked
paler
than
its
wont
poor
darling
murmured
geoffrey
to
himself
has
been
tired
with
her
long
morning
alone
i
must
not
leave
her
again
for
so
long
she
looks
pale
too
i
trust
she
has
not
been
and
very
gently
he
drew
the
so
as
to
shade
her
still
more
from
the
light
closed
the
door
with
noiseless
hand
and
softly
crept
back
along
the
passage
to
occupy
himself
as
best
he
could
without
her
till
she
awoke
already
he
had
grown
very
dependent
upon
her
indoors
especially
he
never
felt
quite
in
his
element
in
the
house
his
life
for
many
years
past
having
literally
been
almost
altogether
spent
in
the
open
air
but
now
it
was
very
different
indoors
meant
marion
and
cheerful
talk
flowers
and
work
and
books
even
in
moderation
now
and
then
a
sweet
face
and
a
graceful
flitting
figure
and
tea
at
all
hours
of
the
day
and
pipes
only
on
sufferance
it
was
all
so
new
to
him
so
wonderfully
pretty
and
delicate
this
atmosphere
of
womanhood
for
the
first
time
really
brought
home
to
him
great
rough
as
he
called
himself
and
if
so
unspeakably
charming
here
in
a
strange
unhomelike
house
what
would
it
not
be
at
the
manor
farm
where
this
sweet
presence
was
to
take
root
and
bloom
for
evermore
death
u
do
part
came
into
mind
that
afternoon
as
he
fidgeted
about
not
knowing
what
to
do
with
himself
wishing
she
would
wake
and
yet
afraid
to
go
near
her
for
fear
of
disturbing
her
death
us
do
part
he
thought
to
himself
queer
sort
of
life
it
would
be
without
her
after
an
hour
or
patience
he
crept
back
again
to
her
room
to
see
if
she
were
awake
but
she
was
still
asleep
he
stood
beside
her
for
a
minute
or
two
just
as
he
was
turning
away
she
awoke
awoke
from
her
dream
that
the
real
was
a
dream
awoke
from
her
sweet
vision
of
dark
eyes
gazing
down
on
her
tenderly
to
find
herself
back
in
the
hateful
world
of
facts
and
geoffrey
baldwin
her
husband
whom
she
did
not
love
standing
at
her
side
with
a
happy
smile
on
his
honest
face
she
glanced
at
him
for
an
instant
then
with
a
recoil
of
something
very
like
actual
aversion
turned
from
him
and
closed
her
eyes
again
as
if
she
wished
to
shut
out
him
and
all
beside
from
her
sight
geoffrey
did
not
read
correctly
the
expression
of
her
face
fortunately
for
him
he
fancied
only
she
was
wearied
or
in
pain
and
his
voice
sounded
anxious
as
he
spoke
to
her
i
disturbed
you
marion
dear
i
was
in
the
room
more
than
an
hour
ago
but
went
away
for
fear
of
waking
you
you
look
well
but
i
hoped
this
sleep
would
have
refreshed
you
you
are
not
in
pain
my
darling
are
you
she
said
without
moving
or
opening
her
eyes
considerably
alarmed
geoffrey
asked
eagerly
how
what
was
the
matter
was
it
her
head
had
she
been
out
in
the
sun
where
was
the
pain
she
replied
in
the
same
tone
awful
visions
of
rheumatic
fever
neuralgia
every
sort
of
illness
of
which
his
experience
being
of
the
smallest
his
horror
was
correspondingly
before
poor
vision
he
carefully
covered
marion
with
the
shawl
she
had
tossed
aside
and
without
speaking
turned
to
leave
the
room
his
step
across
the
floor
roused
her
are
you
going
geoffrey
she
asked
in
a
sharp
impatient
tone
so
unlike
her
own
that
it
increased
his
alarm
call
bentley
in
the
first
place
he
answered
hesitatingly
what
then
she
persisted
go
or
send
for
a
doctor
he
replied
doctor
she
repeated
contemptuously
muttering
to
herself
clever
doctor
truly
he
would
be
who
could
cure
me
a
doctor
she
repeated
aloud
can
you
be
so
foolish
geoffrey
i
interfere
with
you
why
should
you
interfere
with
me
am
i
not
to
have
liberty
to
rest
for
an
hour
or
two
without
you
making
yourself
and
me
absurd
by
talking
of
doctors
you
said
you
were
in
pain
remonstrated
her
husband
considerably
relieved
and
yet
not
a
little
amazed
by
this
sudden
and
ebullition
of
petulance
and
if
i
did
she
replied
wearily
but
more
gently
geoffrey
you
can
understand
there
are
pains
and
pains
i
am
weary
and
exhausted
but
i
want
no
doctor
leave
me
i
beg
of
you
leave
me
alone
i
want
to
go
to
to
dream
she
added
to
herself
geoffrey
left
her
without
saying
more
then
when
she
heard
his
steps
receding
down
the
passage
there
visited
her
the
first
of
a
long
chain
of
tormentors
who
from
that
day
became
no
strangers
to
her
a
pang
of
darted
through
her
for
having
so
cruelly
wounded
the
heart
whose
only
fault
was
its
devotion
to
her
have
vexed
him
she
thought
and
hurt
him
for
the
first
time
since
terrible
mistake
of
ours
it
is
all
a
part
of
the
wretched
and
then
the
ungenerous
thought
occurred
to
is
his
own
fault
he
has
brought
it
on
himself
by
persisting
as
he
did
save
for
and
she
hardened
her
heart
against
him
but
not
for
long
she
had
wronged
him
wronged
him
cruelly
in
thinking
those
few
petulant
words
of
hers
would
have
had
power
even
temporarily
to
chill
or
alienate
him
in
five
minutes
he
was
back
again
with
a
fragrant
cup
of
tea
and
a
delicate
slice
of
bread
and
butter
which
forgive
me
romantic
readers
marion
was
in
her
heart
not
sorry
to
see
she
had
eaten
nothing
since
early
morning
and
violent
emotion
consumes
the
physical
no
less
surely
than
it
exhausts
the
mental
powers
she
drank
the
tea
eagerly
for
her
throat
felt
parched
and
dry
then
with
a
sudden
revulsion
of
deep
pity
for
the
man
whom
she
began
to
see
she
had
so
grievously
deceived
she
said
timidly
glancing
up
at
him
with
a
world
of
conflicting
feelings
in
her
you
geoffrey
you
are
very
good
are
you
vexed
with
me
for
being
so
cross
with
you
my
darling
he
replied
as
he
had
done
once
before
with
you
no
never
fancy
anything
so
and
he
stooped
and
kissed
her
on
the
forehead
that
was
more
than
she
had
expected
she
shrank
back
half
raising
her
hand
as
if
to
repel
him
geoffrey
looked
surprised
and
concerned
but
not
hurt
the
change
in
her
would
take
a
long
time
to
come
home
to
his
unsuspecting
heart
did
not
mean
to
tease
you
he
said
your
head
aching
i
fear
my
poor
dear
you
are
suffering
very
she
said
am
suffering
very
much
but
begin
again
about
a
doctor
geoffrey
she
went
on
growing
excited
see
a
doctor
there
is
nothing
the
matter
with
me
that
a
doctor
is
needed
for
i
shall
be
well
again
by
the
morning
see
i
see
a
well
he
said
know
best
i
suppose
what
will
you
do
you
get
up
a
little
and
come
into
the
other
room
you
can
be
quite
quiet
there
and
i
should
be
horribly
dull
by
myself
he
added
wistfully
half
smiling
at
himself
as
he
spoke
but
no
answering
smile
broke
on
face
she
moved
impatiently
and
answered
know
if
i
shall
get
up
or
not
leave
me
any
way
for
the
present
and
go
and
smoke
or
something
perhaps
i
will
get
up
in
a
while
but
oh
do
so
he
went
and
then
when
alone
she
cried
with
remorse
for
her
unkindness
i
help
it
she
help
it
i
want
to
be
wicked
but
i
am
forced
into
it
i
shall
grow
worse
and
worse
till
i
die
oh
if
only
i
might
die
now
there
was
something
consolatory
in
the
idea
and
it
did
not
seem
wicked
to
wish
for
her
own
death
it
seemed
an
escape
from
the
unbearable
present
and
in
the
thought
she
found
a
strange
sort
of
calm
she
felt
sure
she
was
going
to
be
very
after
all
geoffrey
would
not
be
troubled
with
her
long
in
the
meantime
she
need
not
grudge
what
pleasure
it
was
in
her
power
to
afford
him
so
after
a
while
she
got
up
rang
the
bell
for
her
maid
who
was
full
of
sympathy
for
her
bad
headache
and
smoothed
her
hair
and
arranged
her
dress
so
that
when
she
rejoined
geoffrey
in
the
he
delightedly
congratulated
her
on
looking
right
she
did
her
best
to
be
patient
that
evening
to
endure
her
tender
words
and
caresses
but
it
was
hard
work
and
oh
she
was
thankful
when
night
fell
and
she
could
again
for
a
time
at
least
forget
the
agony
which
she
hoped
was
killing
her
but
in
the
morning
greatly
to
her
surprise
she
was
better
she
felt
terribly
disappointed
that
it
was
so
she
had
counted
so
surely
on
a
return
of
the
low
fever
of
which
she
felt
pretty
certain
a
second
attack
would
prove
fatal
but
she
did
not
understand
her
own
constitution
no
sudden
emotion
however
violent
would
have
power
to
prostrate
one
naturally
so
healthy
what
rather
was
to
be
dreaded
for
her
was
a
long
course
of
suspense
or
suffering
such
as
already
she
had
discontent
anxiety
uncongenial
surroundings
might
gradually
undermine
the
springs
of
her
life
but
she
was
too
young
and
physically
to
elastic
to
give
way
at
a
sudden
sharp
assault
nevertheless
events
had
left
their
mark
on
her
besides
the
suffering
woven
with
many
threads
which
henceforth
must
envelop
her
life
the
actual
temporary
excitement
had
been
too
violent
not
to
affect
her
for
some
time
to
come
she
was
irritable
and
nervous
to
a
miserable
extent
creaking
boots
the
hasty
closing
of
a
door
even
his
voice
not
always
modulated
to
a
nicety
nearly
drove
her
frantic
then
sharp
words
were
followed
by
bitter
and
abasement
it
was
so
undignified
so
lowering
she
said
to
herself
thus
to
bear
her
trial
if
she
had
been
called
upon
to
do
something
great
or
throw
herself
into
fire
or
water
to
save
the
husband
she
did
not
love
it
would
have
been
easy
but
to
feel
herself
tied
to
him
in
this
way
to
know
that
it
was
her
duty
to
listen
with
patience
if
not
interest
to
his
commonplace
conversation
his
stupid
talk
of
weather
and
crops
or
his
anticipations
of
the
coming
this
indeed
was
martyrdom
all
but
unendurable
for
in
these
days
she
was
far
very
far
from
doing
justice
to
the
real
character
of
the
man
she
had
married
they
did
not
stay
long
at
the
peacock
the
place
grew
hateful
to
her
at
first
there
was
a
sort
of
fascination
about
the
old
arbour
in
the
garden
she
had
a
childish
unreasoning
fancy
that
some
day
ralph
would
appear
there
again
that
finding
his
life
unendurable
without
her
he
would
return
in
very
recklessness
of
misery
to
see
her
again
if
but
for
a
moment
but
he
never
came
and
she
learnt
to
loathe
the
place
associated
with
such
disappointment
there
were
times
when
she
blamed
herself
bitterly
for
her
behaviour
to
him
during
that
last
interview
she
had
been
cold
repellent
she
had
belied
herself
in
concealing
from
him
as
she
fancied
she
had
the
depth
the
intensity
of
her
devotion
the
anguish
of
parting
from
him
forever
he
had
gone
away
she
thought
suffering
in
himself
terribly
no
doubt
but
with
no
conception
of
the
awfulness
of
the
misery
which
he
was
leaving
her
to
bear
alone
had
he
realised
it
would
he
have
left
her
he
not
he
was
wise
and
have
devised
some
means
of
freeing
her
from
this
terrible
bondage
of
even
now
joining
her
life
to
his
where
alone
it
would
be
worthy
of
the
name
she
had
told
him
once
she
could
not
love
him
so
entirely
did
she
not
know
there
was
one
thing
he
cared
for
more
than
her
she
had
called
it
in
her
silly
childish
ignorance
and
inexperience
but
what
was
right
could
this
the
life
she
was
leading
of
misery
to
herself
and
sooner
or
later
to
her
husband
also
utter
stagnation
intellectually
and
certain
deterioration
morally
could
this
be
right
was
not
her
case
altogether
exceptional
were
there
not
must
there
not
be
where
the
right
and
wrong
of
other
more
happily
commonplace
lives
changed
which
it
was
worse
than
obstinate
folly
actual
suicide
to
bow
to
the
laws
formed
but
with
reference
to
circumstances
and
individuals
these
suggestions
tormented
her
at
her
very
worst
times
in
such
moments
i
think
truly
the
tempter
himself
had
her
geoffrey
who
remained
sturdily
convinced
that
physical
suffering
alone
was
to
be
blamed
for
her
strange
moodiness
and
irritability
agreed
gladly
to
trying
the
effect
of
change
of
scene
for
some
weeks
they
never
rested
hardly
arrived
at
one
place
before
baldwin
took
a
dislike
to
it
and
insisted
on
rushing
off
to
another
with
equally
unsatisfactory
results
in
one
thing
however
geoffrey
had
his
way
marion
found
herself
obliged
to
give
in
to
consulting
a
doctor
a
kindly
and
sensible
man
happened
to
be
the
one
they
lit
upon
and
what
little
was
in
his
power
he
did
for
her
that
something
beyond
his
reach
was
at
fault
he
suspected
though
he
wisely
kept
his
ideas
on
the
subject
to
himself
the
young
anxiety
he
was
able
with
perfect
honesty
to
relieve
baldwin
was
suffering
physically
from
nothing
but
a
certain
amount
of
nervous
prostration
consequent
in
all
probability
upon
the
long
illness
some
months
previously
of
which
geoffrey
told
him
time
and
care
would
alone
set
her
to
marion
herself
he
spoke
more
plainly
he
judged
that
she
could
bear
his
doing
so
and
be
probably
the
worse
of
are
not
really
ill
at
present
my
dear
madam
he
said
you
are
fast
going
the
way
to
make
yourself
so
not
seriously
not
dangerously
at
least
he
added
hastily
misinterpreting
the
start
with
which
marion
looked
up
at
his
words
and
repining
kill
at
least
they
take
a
good
while
about
it
and
an
uncommonly
disagreeable
process
it
is
but
what
i
wish
to
warn
you
of
is
that
continued
yielding
to
mental
depression
or
discomfort
such
as
i
can
see
you
are
at
present
suffering
from
ends
in
nine
cases
out
of
ten
in
chronic
a
worse
trial
my
dear
young
lady
than
you
at
your
age
and
with
your
evidently
small
experience
of
sickness
can
have
any
notion
of
you
have
had
your
share
of
trouble
in
your
short
more
than
your
let
me
beseech
you
not
to
add
to
it
as
you
are
too
surely
doing
trouble
is
hard
to
bear
at
the
best
of
times
but
none
the
easier
i
assure
you
when
our
physical
strength
has
failed
one
can
understand
other
troubles
said
marion
coldly
sullenly
almost
if
so
ugly
a
word
can
be
applied
to
such
gentle
tones
can
prescribe
for
bodily
illness
i
have
no
doubt
but
you
order
a
patient
to
get
well
neither
can
any
one
make
himself
happy
at
not
replied
the
kind
old
man
unfortunately
it
is
in
your
power
as
in
mine
and
every
one
to
make
ourselves
more
marion
did
not
reply
and
he
went
on
am
not
prying
into
your
sorrows
my
dear
young
lady
i
can
quite
believe
that
notwithstanding
the
blessings
you
possess
your
troubles
have
been
very
great
the
more
earnest
therefore
must
be
the
effort
to
live
them
down
in
the
best
sense
but
i
have
been
talking
more
like
a
clergyman
than
a
must
forgive
me
can
i
see
your
husband
for
a
moment
i
am
anxious
to
tell
him
that
so
far
there
is
nothing
much
amiss
he
i
think
is
inclined
to
err
on
the
side
of
spoiling
you
is
he
not
must
i
give
him
a
hint
that
a
little
scolding
now
and
then
would
do
you
no
harm
wish
you
would
she
replied
is
far
too
good
and
patient
and
i
am
very
she
looked
up
as
she
spoke
with
a
half
smile
but
her
eyes
were
full
of
tears
and
something
in
the
tone
of
her
voice
haunted
the
good
doctor
for
many
a
day
to
come
his
word
however
more
than
his
medicine
acted
upon
her
to
some
extent
as
a
tonic
her
health
improved
her
nervousness
and
irritability
decreased
geoffrey
was
enchanted
with
the
success
of
his
first
exertion
of
marital
authority
are
looking
ever
so
much
better
my
darling
he
exclaimed
joyfully
old
fellow
was
a
regular
brick
by
jove
i
wish
i
had
doubled
his
fee
you
be
looking
ill
after
all
when
i
take
you
home
next
week
how
thankful
i
am
what
would
the
world
be
to
me
without
you
my
dearest
and
his
voice
grew
husky
as
he
looked
at
her
and
tenderly
raised
her
face
to
his
but
she
could
not
return
his
gaze
of
loving
devotion
could
not
meet
his
honest
eyes
bright
with
pleasure
at
her
improved
and
spirits
for
with
returning
strength
and
powers
of
a
new
misery
had
come
upon
growing
consciousness
of
how
grievously
though
unintentionally
she
had
deceived
geoffrey
baldwin
when
she
told
him
that
at
least
what
heart
was
left
her
was
free
to
give
to
him
that
the
old
love
was
dead
and
buried
for
in
the
first
selfishness
of
her
overpowering
wretchedness
this
feeling
had
somewhat
fallen
into
the
background
now
that
her
powers
were
regaining
their
balance
it
revived
with
redoubled
force
it
was
agony
to
her
to
receive
constant
expressions
of
trusting
almost
reverential
love
a
hundred
times
she
had
it
on
her
lips
to
confess
to
him
not
the
whole
but
so
much
of
her
secret
as
she
felt
it
due
to
him
to
own
only
the
thought
of
what
this
knowledge
would
be
to
him
of
his
happiness
wrecked
as
well
as
her
own
withheld
her
but
she
felt
that
before
long
it
must
come
whatever
misery
it
might
entail
it
must
be
done
for
she
could
not
live
with
him
feeling
that
systematically
and
deliberately
she
was
deceiving
him
she
grew
strangely
silent
and
absent
in
manner
geoffrey
feared
she
was
growing
ill
again
and
hastened
their
return
home
in
our
own
house
dear
with
all
home
comforts
about
you
feel
so
different
he
said
constant
travelling
is
really
very
tiring
no
wonder
done
up
how
delightful
it
will
be
to
see
you
at
the
old
farm
i
shall
then
feel
quite
sure
that
you
really
belong
to
me
my
she
did
not
answer
he
drew
round
her
averted
face
to
his
amazement
she
was
in
tears
he
exclaimed
in
astonishment
dearest
what
is
the
matter
she
seized
his
hand
convulsively
and
held
it
fast
then
restraining
with
difficulty
the
hysterical
weeping
which
she
felt
coming
upon
her
she
spoke
fast
and
excitedly
to
her
bewildered
listener
she
said
can
not
bear
it
all
these
weeks
you
have
borne
with
all
my
strange
fancies
and
wayward
tempers
you
have
been
very
good
to
me
for
truly
i
have
been
very
trying
you
must
have
thought
me
strangely
unlike
what
you
fancied
me
i
am
strangely
unlike
what
i
was
sadly
changed
from
my
old
self
for
i
used
to
be
gentle
and
sweet
tempered
geoffrey
i
must
tell
you
the
truth
cost
what
it
may
for
otherwise
i
can
not
live
beside
you
geoffrey
poor
geoffrey
it
is
dreadful
for
me
to
say
and
dreadful
for
you
to
hear
i
told
you
a
falsehood
that
day
i
promised
to
marry
you
i
said
at
least
you
had
now
no
rival
i
told
you
i
no
longer
loved
that
other
whom
i
had
loved
so
intensely
it
was
no
intentional
falsehood
i
believed
it
myself
but
for
all
that
it
was
not
true
i
did
still
love
him
geoffrey
then
when
i
said
i
did
not
i
did
love
him
even
then
with
all
the
love
of
my
nature
and
oh
geoffrey
i
love
him
now
forgive
me
for
i
am
most
miserable
me
for
i
can
not
forgive
there
was
not
the
slightest
sound
the
hand
she
still
held
tightly
clasped
was
not
withdrawn
but
geoffrey
spoke
not
a
word
marion
went
on
will
tell
you
all
about
it
all
at
least
that
you
ought
to
know
how
i
found
it
out
i
mean
it
was
a
fortnight
after
we
were
married
that
day
do
you
remember
at
the
peacock
when
you
thought
i
was
ill
said
her
husband
need
not
tell
me
i
have
no
need
to
hear
what
it
must
cost
you
much
to
tell
you
saw
him
i
suppose
saw
him
or
heard
from
does
not
matter
which
there
had
been
some
mistake
i
suppose
he
was
not
married
as
you
had
been
told
she
said
repeating
his
very
words
mechanically
had
been
a
mistake
he
was
not
muttered
geoffrey
it
sounded
like
a
groan
will
tell
began
again
but
he
stopped
her
again
he
said
not
tell
me
do
not
treat
me
as
if
i
were
a
judge
and
you
a
culprit
at
the
bar
heaven
knows
i
have
heard
enough
and
god
knows
i
trust
you
marion
trust
you
utterly
and
entirely
were
you
less
worthy
of
my
trust
this
might
be
easier
to
bear
i
quite
see
it
yet
i
get
it
plain
to
myself
but
that
will
come
i
suppose
only
do
not
ever
tell
me
any
more
it
need
never
again
be
mentioned
between
us
i
think
think
i
should
thank
you
for
telling
me
it
was
right
i
suppose
but
i
quite
see
it
yet
for
my
part
in
it
all
for
what
i
did
persisting
in
trying
to
win
you
i
ask
you
to
forgive
you
she
exclaimed
geoffrey
your
asking
it
crushes
do
not
wish
to
pain
you
he
said
gently
but
resolutely
withdrawing
the
hand
she
still
held
you
must
remember
it
is
rather
hard
on
this
i
can
not
just
yet
get
accustomed
to
it
so
if
in
any
way
i
fain
you
you
must
forgive
then
he
got
up
and
strolled
to
the
window
it
was
a
beautiful
summer
picture
of
peace
and
calm
loveliness
is
hard
upon
me
he
murmured
to
hard
upon
me
but
good
god
how
she
must
have
suffered
how
she
must
suffer
still
tied
to
a
rough
boor
like
me
that
other
i
want
to
know
who
he
is
i
should
pity
him
too
i
suppose
but
not
quite
good
enough
for
that
for
i
see
that
his
case
is
as
bad
as
mine
heaven
knows
though
he
may
be
a
hundred
times
my
superior
in
else
he
love
her
better
and
to
think
my
darling
how
you
must
have
suffered
if
only
geoffrey
could
have
uttered
his
thoughts
his
generous
unselfish
thoughts
aloud
who
knows
what
even
then
might
have
been
the
result
but
he
could
not
a
strange
reserve
had
fallen
upon
this
naturally
open
and
outspoken
being
gentle
and
attentive
as
ever
to
marion
she
was
yet
utterly
changed
he
avoided
most
pointedly
the
slightest
demonstration
of
the
affection
with
which
his
very
heart
was
bursting
not
a
word
of
endearment
not
a
gesture
of
fondness
did
he
allow
himself
it
was
what
marion
had
been
wishing
for
and
yet
it
pained
her
but
gradually
she
grew
accustomed
to
it
and
slowly
but
surely
began
that
lamentable
drifting
apart
so
sad
to
see
in
two
lives
which
should
be
as
one
henceforth
she
felt
free
to
live
yet
more
entirely
in
the
past
and
in
herself
for
she
was
no
longer
fettered
by
the
necessity
of
maintaining
a
semblance
of
affection
geoffrey
she
fancied
had
felt
it
much
less
than
she
had
feared
he
would
soon
be
absorbed
and
happy
in
his
and
country
pursuits
so
she
did
not
trouble
herself
very
much
about
him
was
not
after
all
she
decided
man
of
very
deep
feeling
his
dogs
and
horses
would
soon
make
up
to
him
for
any
disappointment
he
might
have
experienced
in
a
yet
being
a
woman
with
all
a
illogical
the
reflection
was
not
without
a
certain
amount
of
bitterness
chapter
iv
little
bird
now
to
salute
the
morn
upon
the
naked
branches
sets
her
foot
the
leaves
still
lying
at
the
mossy
root
and
there
a
silly
chirruping
cloth
keep
as
if
she
fain
would
sing
yet
fain
would
weep
praising
fair
summer
that
too
soon
is
gone
and
sad
for
winter
too
soon
coming
drayton
the
wind
waits
so
in
winter
for
the
summers
dead
and
all
sad
sounds
are
funeral
cries
for
what
has
been
and
is
not
the
spanish
gypsy
then
i
suppose
will
see
us
at
the
manor
farm
said
geoffrey
the
last
evening
of
their
travels
marion
noticed
he
did
not
speak
of
his
dwelling
as
and
she
looked
up
quickly
for
she
fancied
there
was
a
slight
a
very
slight
quiver
in
his
voice
but
no
it
must
have
been
only
fancy
he
sat
at
the
table
arranging
his
fishing
book
apparently
engrossed
in
its
contents
suppose
so
she
replied
indifferently
wanted
to
tell
you
he
said
you
will
not
find
the
house
in
particularly
good
order
that
is
to
say
it
has
not
been
for
ages
i
meant
to
have
had
some
of
the
rooms
refurnished
but
there
was
so
little
time
before
here
he
dropped
a
fly
and
had
to
stoop
down
to
look
for
it
on
the
carpet
we
were
married
he
went
on
with
a
change
in
his
voice
i
deferred
doing
so
thinking
you
might
like
to
choose
the
furniture
yourself
so
as
soon
as
we
are
settled
i
hope
you
will
order
whatever
you
like
for
the
rooms
in
which
you
will
take
an
interest
the
and
there
is
a
nice
little
room
up
stairs
too
which
i
think
you
might
like
as
a
sort
of
boudoir
or
whatever
it
is
called
it
opens
out
of
the
pleasantest
of
the
bedrooms
the
one
which
i
think
you
will
probably
choose
for
your
own
i
am
very
anxious
that
you
should
arrange
all
just
as
you
wish
and
of
course
i
shall
not
in
the
least
interfere
with
any
of
your
plans
i
shall
keep
my
own
old
rooms
just
as
they
were
they
will
do
very
well
without
doing
up
indeed
my
old
den
would
never
be
comfortable
again
if
it
were
meddled
this
was
a
long
speech
for
the
present
geoffrey
to
make
for
he
had
grown
very
silent
of
late
when
alone
with
his
wife
that
is
to
say
outsiders
would
probably
have
perceived
no
change
in
him
you
said
marion
in
a
tone
that
was
meant
to
be
cordial
am
sure
it
will
all
be
very
nice
the
house
is
very
old
is
it
not
she
went
on
wishing
to
show
some
interest
in
the
subject
he
replied
old
some
parts
of
it
in
particular
i
wish
it
were
my
least
he
went
on
used
to
wish
it
now
i
know
that
i
care
much
to
own
always
thought
it
was
your
own
said
marion
with
some
surprise
thought
your
father
bought
it
long
answered
geoffrey
only
got
it
on
a
long
lease
it
will
be
out
in
a
few
years
now
i
got
a
hint
once
that
lord
brackley
would
not
object
to
selling
it
when
the
lease
is
out
but
i
know
that
i
should
care
to
buy
it
as
likely
as
not
i
shall
leave
but
the
rest
of
his
words
were
too
low
for
marion
to
catch
you
have
no
land
in
brentshire
she
enquired
a
rood
he
replied
anywhere
else
the
old
place
that
belonged
to
my
grandfather
for
i
had
a
grandfather
though
miss
tremlett
would
probably
tell
you
i
was
over
at
the
other
side
of
the
country
but
neither
my
father
nor
i
cared
about
was
ugly
and
before
he
died
my
father
advised
me
to
accept
the
first
good
offer
i
got
for
it
so
i
sold
it
last
year
very
advantageously
indeed
the
purchase
money
is
still
in
the
old
bank
i
should
invest
it
somehow
i
suppose
for
too
large
a
sum
to
leave
in
a
country
bank
but
all
i
have
is
there
and
i
really
know
what
else
to
do
with
it
i
have
always
had
a
sort
of
idea
i
should
buy
another
place
the
bank
is
as
safe
as
can
be
of
am
actually
a
sleeping
partner
in
it
still
but
i
believe
they
want
to
keep
me
that
new
man
they
took
in
lately
has
such
heaps
of
money
they
say
and
making
all
sorts
of
father
would
not
have
liked
that
said
marion
indeed
replied
geoffrey
sort
of
change
he
always
thought
must
be
for
the
he
was
talking
more
naturally
and
heartily
than
had
been
the
case
for
some
time
in
the
interest
of
the
conversation
appearing
temporarily
to
forget
the
sad
change
that
had
come
over
their
relations
but
suddenly
he
recollected
himself
with
an
entire
alteration
of
manner
he
went
on
am
forgetting
that
these
personal
matters
can
have
no
interest
for
you
i
beg
your
pardon
for
troubling
you
with
them
still
perhaps
he
added
thoughtfully
is
as
well
for
you
to
understand
these
things
however
uninteresting
they
may
marion
looked
and
felt
hurt
she
said
reproachfully
go
too
he
turned
sharply
and
looked
at
her
but
her
face
was
bent
over
her
book
and
she
did
not
see
the
wistful
entreaty
in
his
gaze
he
said
nothing
aloud
but
to
himself
he
murmured
far
ah
no
no
more
half
gifts
for
me
which
in
the
end
are
worse
than
none
but
she
did
not
mean
it
poor
child
even
now
she
understands
me
less
than
ever
as
if
her
kindness
her
pity
were
not
far
harder
to
bear
than
her
the
next
day
they
returned
brentshire
geoffrey
as
thankful
when
it
was
over
and
they
had
settled
down
into
a
sort
of
commonplace
routine
and
to
a
great
extent
independence
of
each
other
in
their
daily
lives
it
was
grievously
hard
upon
heartless
harder
to
bear
i
think
than
if
his
joyous
anticipations
had
been
cut
short
by
death
itself
for
had
it
been
a
dead
bride
he
was
thus
bringing
home
he
would
not
have
felt
so
far
so
utterly
separated
from
her
in
all
that
constitutes
the
real
bitterness
of
disunion
as
he
felt
himself
now
from
his
living
unloving
pale
cold
marion
whose
terrible
words
still
rang
in
his
ears
did
love
him
even
then
with
all
the
love
of
my
nature
and
oh
geoffrey
i
love
him
they
both
though
they
did
not
allude
to
it
dreaded
intensely
the
first
visit
to
miss
veronica
by
tacit
agreement
they
did
not
pay
it
together
by
tacit
agreement
too
they
decided
that
the
secret
of
their
fatal
should
if
possible
be
concealed
from
the
affectionate
and
unselfish
friend
who
to
some
extent
was
responsible
for
their
having
committed
it
but
they
reckoned
without
their
host
perceptions
naturally
acute
and
rendered
still
more
so
by
her
reflective
life
and
in
her
present
case
by
her
loving
anxiety
were
not
so
easily
to
be
deceived
though
no
word
of
misgiving
escaped
her
she
yet
saw
too
clearly
that
gaiety
was
expressions
of
content
and
satisfaction
wore
not
neither
of
the
two
confided
in
her
as
of
old
she
was
the
last
person
in
the
world
to
take
offence
or
be
hurt
by
their
silence
that
its
motive
was
to
spare
her
pain
she
divined
by
instinct
still
on
the
whole
i
think
it
was
a
mistake
poor
veronica
suffered
i
believe
more
acutely
from
the
mystery
surrounding
her
evident
alienation
from
each
other
than
would
have
been
the
case
had
they
taken
her
into
their
confidence
and
related
to
her
the
whole
of
the
strange
and
exceptional
history
on
their
side
both
geoffrey
and
marion
paid
no
light
price
for
the
reserve
they
thought
it
their
duty
to
maintain
for
the
first
time
since
childhood
geoffrey
felt
himself
forced
to
shun
the
society
of
the
friend
to
whom
he
had
carried
every
grief
and
perplexity
every
interest
every
joy
of
his
life
and
to
marion
likewise
it
was
no
small
trial
to
be
deprived
at
this
critical
time
of
the
wisest
woman
friend
she
had
ever
known
of
the
gentle
sympathy
which
during
the
many
dreary
months
of
her
mallingford
life
had
never
failed
her
the
manor
farm
was
one
of
those
rather
anomalous
habitations
half
farm
half
house
of
which
in
some
of
the
agricultural
counties
one
sees
so
many
with
no
special
characteristics
of
its
own
save
perhaps
that
it
was
somewhat
quaint
and
decidedly
old
fashioned
hardly
picturesque
and
not
exactly
ugly
it
was
the
sort
or
house
that
takes
its
colouring
mainly
from
the
lives
of
its
inhabitants
all
dwellings
are
not
of
this
description
there
are
venerable
walls
which
we
can
not
but
associate
with
gloom
and
solemnity
however
merry
may
have
been
the
voices
however
ringing
the
laughter
which
there
we
may
have
heard
resound
there
are
cottages
which
our
memory
refuses
to
depict
save
as
smiling
in
the
sunshine
though
our
sojourn
therein
may
have
been
of
the
most
sorrowful
and
the
brightness
without
seemed
but
to
mock
the
aching
hearts
and
eyes
within
but
the
manor
farm
was
by
no
means
an
impressive
abode
it
was
comfortable
already
and
with
a
little
trouble
might
have
been
made
pretty
but
alas
at
this
time
there
was
no
grace
or
sweetness
in
the
heart
of
the
young
girl
who
came
with
reluctant
steps
to
be
its
mistress
whose
youth
and
brightness
had
been
swamped
in
the
deep
waters
through
which
she
had
passed
unconsciously
she
was
entering
on
a
new
phase
in
her
experience
the
first
effect
of
her
again
meeting
with
ralph
had
been
to
revive
in
her
the
consciousness
of
his
irresistibly
strong
personal
influence
for
a
time
she
felt
very
near
to
him
as
if
indeed
she
only
lived
in
the
immaterial
union
with
him
which
she
had
before
imagined
was
at
an
end
this
did
not
surprise
her
it
seemed
to
her
that
the
bar
on
her
side
of
a
loveless
marriage
was
in
point
of
fact
no
bar
at
all
whereas
so
long
as
she
had
believed
in
his
union
to
another
she
had
felt
herself
more
utterly
divided
from
him
than
by
death
itself
indefensible
logic
no
doubt
but
so
she
felt
and
so
she
expressed
it
to
herself
she
was
to
a
great
had
been
drifting
away
from
ralph
only
his
actual
presence
his
personal
influence
had
recalled
her
of
which
he
himself
was
conscious
when
he
deliberately
resolved
utterly
to
sever
himself
from
her
life
by
no
species
of
intercourse
or
communication
however
apparently
innocent
or
irreproachable
to
keep
alive
in
her
the
consciousness
of
an
influence
so
fatal
to
her
prospects
of
peace
as
the
wife
of
another
man
i
hardly
think
this
first
phase
of
her
suffering
though
acute
almost
to
agony
was
after
all
the
worst
there
is
a
great
compensatory
power
in
strong
after
days
of
grey
depression
are
to
my
thinking
the
most
to
be
dreaded
on
these
she
was
now
entering
for
though
she
knew
it
not
the
full
strength
of
his
immediate
influence
was
already
beginning
to
fade
the
entering
on
a
new
life
the
return
to
scenes
with
which
he
was
in
no
wise
associated
had
much
to
do
with
this
still
at
times
the
first
sharp
agony
returned
to
her
but
generally
when
roused
by
some
external
agency
the
sight
of
any
silly
trifling
thing
associated
with
book
out
of
which
he
had
read
to
her
resembling
his
even
little
details
of
dress
recalling
had
power
to
stab
her
ah
yes
even
to
the
day
of
her
death
she
felt
that
the
scent
of
honeysuckle
would
be
to
her
unendurable
for
that
fatal
day
in
his
excitement
ralph
had
plucked
a
spray
off
the
luxuriant
branches
overhanging
the
old
arbour
and
ruthlessly
crushing
it
in
his
hands
the
strong
almost
too
sweet
perfume
had
reached
her
as
she
sat
before
him
but
these
acute
sensations
gradually
grew
to
be
of
rarer
occurrence
very
possibly
had
her
new
life
at
the
manor
farm
been
fuller
and
more
congenial
had
geoffrey
been
more
experienced
less
humble
and
perhaps
less
unselfish
at
this
crisis
things
might
have
mend
by
allowing
her
to
see
that
notwithstanding
all
that
had
passed
he
yet
loved
her
as
fervently
as
before
that
yet
she
was
to
him
a
very
necessity
of
his
being
the
husband
might
gradually
have
drawn
her
out
of
herself
and
eventually
led
her
at
once
to
cling
to
and
support
the
man
who
truly
as
he
had
once
said
found
without
a
very
mockery
of
the
word
but
geoffrey
could
not
do
this
he
pitied
her
too
much
he
hated
himself
for
what
he
had
brought
upon
her
he
went
to
the
extreme
of
fancying
himself
actually
repulsive
to
her
he
guarded
himself
from
the
slightest
word
or
sign
of
familiarity
or
affection
imagining
that
the
revulsion
these
would
engender
would
drive
them
yet
further
and
more
hopelessly
apart
least
he
thought
shall
live
in
peace
all
i
can
now
do
to
please
her
is
to
keep
out
of
her
way
and
not
disgust
her
by
constantly
reminding
her
of
her
so
though
his
whole
existence
was
full
of
her
though
her
slightest
wish
was
immediately
though
unobtrusively
attended
to
he
yet
left
her
to
herself
maintaining
an
appearance
of
such
indifference
to
her
and
adsorption
in
his
independent
pursuits
that
the
girl
was
almost
to
be
excused
for
imagining
that
geoffrey
was
of
a
farmer
than
a
man
incapable
of
very
refined
or
affection
and
that
after
all
so
far
as
he
was
concerned
what
had
happened
did
not
so
much
matter
would
have
been
pretty
sure
to
get
tired
of
me
before
long
in
any
case
was
the
reflection
with
which
she
threw
off
all
sense
of
responsibility
with
respect
to
him
and
stifled
for
the
time
the
pangs
of
reproach
for
the
blight
which
through
her
had
fallen
on
his
sunny
life
there
was
little
society
of
any
desirable
kind
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
manor
farm
the
other
side
of
the
county
was
much
more
sociable
but
about
brackley
there
were
few
resident
county
great
man
of
the
place
a
permanent
absentee
besides
which
the
position
had
been
a
somewhat
anomalous
one
lying
rather
on
the
border
lands
for
the
status
as
banker
in
mallingford
naturally
connected
him
with
the
little
town
while
at
the
same
time
it
induced
a
species
of
acquaintance
with
the
districts
rooted
aversion
from
earliest
childhood
to
anything
in
the
shape
of
office
or
desk
or
indeed
to
indoor
occupation
of
any
kind
had
led
to
the
removal
to
the
manor
farm
some
time
before
the
old
death
hunting
shooting
and
so
on
with
the
sons
of
the
few
squires
in
the
neighbourhood
had
brought
about
the
sort
of
bachelor
friendliness
between
him
and
these
families
which
was
pleasant
enough
so
far
as
it
went
but
committed
the
other
side
to
nothing
in
respect
of
the
future
baldwin
had
he
married
quite
in
his
own
sphere
or
slightly
beneath
him
he
would
have
sunk
as
a
benedick
into
peaceful
obscurity
but
when
it
was
known
that
his
bride
though
poor
was
a
daughter
of
the
hartford
vere
himself
a
cadet
of
one
of
the
brentshire
families
mammas
began
to
think
they
must
really
call
at
the
farm
and
a
little
attention
to
her
poor
young
thing
to
which
disinterested
amiability
on
the
part
of
their
spouses
papas
being
in
general
more
in
such
matters
made
of
course
no
objection
so
marion
received
some
visitors
of
whom
the
copleys
of
the
wood
were
the
only
ones
in
whom
she
felt
the
slightest
interest
a
moderate
amount
of
invitations
to
dreary
or
still
more
trying
visits
followed
geoffrey
thought
it
right
to
accept
them
so
feeling
that
to
her
change
of
scene
was
but
the
replacing
of
one
kind
of
dulness
by
another
marion
agreed
to
his
decision
and
they
went
it
was
really
not
lively
work
but
the
dreariness
no
doubt
lay
chiefly
in
herself
for
after
all
there
were
sensible
kindly
people
among
their
entertainers
and
though
the
world
not
all
champagne
is
not
to
be
not
certainly
when
we
are
young
and
fresh
and
vigorous
inclined
as
youth
should
be
to
the
use
of
spectacles
and
to
mistaking
for
the
genuine
article
but
young
baldwin
was
censorious
because
unhappy
difficult
to
please
because
dissatisfied
with
herself
people
were
kindly
inclined
to
her
they
knew
she
had
long
been
motherless
and
of
late
fatherless
as
well
her
only
brother
separated
from
her
by
half
the
world
her
present
position
though
the
wife
of
fine
a
fellow
as
ever
breathed
far
lower
socially
speaking
than
originally
she
might
have
aspired
to
altogether
a
good
deal
of
kindness
really
genuine
so
far
as
it
went
might
have
been
received
by
her
had
she
encouraged
it
but
she
did
not
not
she
told
herself
so
her
new
acquaintances
felt
repelled
naturally
enough
and
she
sensitive
to
a
fault
felt
she
was
not
liked
and
drew
back
still
further
into
her
shell
of
cold
reserve
of
course
it
was
called
and
has
she
to
be
proud
of
next
came
to
be
asked
when
the
poor
name
was
brought
on
the
tapis
after
one
of
these
visits
she
was
invariably
more
depressed
than
before
she
was
not
hardened
to
feeling
herself
disliked
nor
callous
to
the
womanly
mortification
of
knowing
she
had
not
been
seen
to
advantage
she
fancied
she
was
growing
ugly
she
knew
she
had
grown
unamiable
and
she
was
angry
with
herself
while
yet
she
was
bitter
at
others
geoffrey
above
all
when
in
company
he
looked
so
well
and
in
such
good
spirits
that
at
times
marion
thought
she
almost
hated
him
truly
she
was
hard
to
please
had
he
allowed
himself
to
appear
depressed
or
in
any
way
different
from
his
former
joyous
self
she
would
in
her
heart
have
accused
him
of
indelicacy
of
obtruding
upon
her
regardless
of
her
feelings
the
pain
she
had
brought
upon
him
the
wreck
she
had
made
of
his
life
and
the
season
too
was
against
her
autumn
again
dying
hour
when
all
around
was
but
too
much
in
harmony
with
her
desolate
life
but
too
apt
to
foster
the
morbid
unhealthiness
which
was
fast
enveloping
her
whole
existence
the
dullness
of
her
daily
life
came
to
have
a
strange
fascination
for
her
its
regularity
seemed
to
be
beating
time
to
some
approaching
change
some
crisis
in
her
fate
for
that
some
such
was
at
hand
she
felt
convinced
the
present
was
too
unendurable
too
essentially
unnatural
to
be
long
continuance
so
in
the
intervals
of
her
irritation
at
her
husband
she
lived
to
all
appearance
contentedly
enough
in
the
monotony
so
fatal
to
all
growth
and
healthy
development
geoffrey
had
no
idea
how
bad
things
were
with
her
he
thought
he
was
giving
her
all
she
would
accept
undisturbed
peace
and
perfect
independence
yet
his
very
heart
bled
for
her
often
very
often
when
she
little
suspected
it
he
made
one
grand
mistake
he
gave
her
no
responsibilities
no
necessary
duties
her
time
was
her
own
the
housekeeping
was
all
attended
to
by
a
confidential
and
efficient
servant
whose
accounts
even
were
overlooked
by
the
master
instead
of
by
the
mistress
of
the
establishment
money
marion
had
in
plenty
more
than
she
knew
what
to
do
with
for
she
had
never
been
on
the
subject
of
dress
and
even
her
old
love
of
books
and
music
seemed
to
be
deserting
her
she
would
not
ride
the
horse
destined
for
her
use
stood
idle
in
the
stable
and
more
than
once
geoffrey
so
nearly
lost
heart
that
he
was
on
the
point
of
selling
it
he
had
one
great
advantage
over
marion
he
was
the
possessor
of
that
mysterious
and
to
mere
spectators
somewhat
irritating
gift
known
as
there
were
times
when
in
spite
of
all
his
unspeakable
disappointment
his
bitter
the
young
man
could
not
help
feeling
happy
an
exciting
run
a
bracing
frosty
morning
in
his
fields
filled
him
for
the
time
with
his
old
joyousness
the
exhilaration
of
life
in
itself
apart
from
all
modifying
circumstances
poor
fellow
she
need
not
have
grudged
him
what
afterwards
on
looking
back
through
a
clearer
atmosphere
she
believed
to
have
been
the
only
compensatory
influence
in
the
lonely
existence
to
one
so
frank
and
affectionate
more
trying
even
than
she
with
her
greater
powers
of
reserve
and
could
altogether
realize
now
and
then
though
rarely
the
cloudy
gloom
of
mutual
reserve
and
apparent
indifference
into
which
day
by
day
they
were
drifting
further
was
broken
painfully
enough
by
stormy
flashes
of
outspoken
recrimination
and
wounding
reproach
naturally
they
were
both
but
this
wretched
state
of
things
was
fast
souring
them
scenes
miserable
to
witness
had
any
friend
been
by
lowering
in
the
extreme
to
reflect
upon
in
calmer
moments
from
time
to
time
occurred
in
these
it
is
but
justice
to
geoffrey
to
say
that
he
was
rarely
if
ever
the
aggressor
one
dull
foggy
morning
a
unfortunately
for
marion
yielding
to
atmospheric
influences
was
in
a
mood
at
once
captious
and
gloomy
little
disposed
to
take
interest
in
of
all
in
her
this
uninviting
morning
she
was
sitting
discontented
and
unoccupied
in
the
little
boudoir
she
had
not
yet
found
heart
to
when
the
door
opened
suddenly
and
geoffrey
appeared
he
burst
in
looking
eager
and
happy
like
his
old
self
for
the
time
at
least
marion
he
exclaimed
put
on
your
hat
and
come
round
with
me
for
a
moment
to
the
stables
that
new
mare
i
bought
last
week
has
just
come
she
is
such
a
perfect
beauty
do
but
marion
did
not
move
but
sat
there
her
face
turned
from
him
affecting
to
warm
her
hands
at
the
fire
then
she
glanced
at
the
door
which
geoffrey
had
left
open
and
said
peevishly
wish
you
would
remember
that
other
people
feel
the
cold
if
you
the
draught
along
the
passage
makes
this
room
almost
uninhabitable
geoffrey
closed
the
door
gently
with
a
ready
apology
for
his
carelessness
then
he
returned
to
the
charge
will
come
out
though
you
i
am
really
so
anxious
to
show
you
my
new
purchase
she
is
rather
young
to
do
much
work
this
year
but
by
another
she
will
be
all
i
could
wish
i
really
never
saw
a
more
beautiful
am
glad
you
are
pleased
said
marion
coldly
you
must
excuse
my
joining
in
the
chorus
of
admiration
which
i
have
no
doubt
is
going
on
in
the
i
should
i
only
disappoint
you
for
i
really
could
not
get
up
the
proper
amount
of
face
fell
used
to
take
some
interest
in
my
horses
marion
he
said
deprecatingly
possibly
she
replied
in
a
somewhat
sneering
tone
a
bad
thing
in
its
place
but
as
for
living
on
it
altogether
a
different
matter
long
ago
i
could
afford
to
be
amused
by
your
stable
now
and
then
but
it
never
seem
to
occur
to
you
that
possible
to
have
too
much
even
of
the
charms
of
bay
mares
and
you
must
excuse
my
bad
understand
you
replied
geoffrey
can
not
feel
that
i
deserve
to
be
taunted
with
having
bored
you
with
anything
that
interested
suppose
you
do
understand
me
she
answered
in
the
same
contemptuous
manner
made
one
grand
mistake
for
which
we
are
both
of
imagining
you
ever
could
do
so
go
back
to
your
hones
with
whom
i
can
assure
you
you
have
more
in
common
than
you
could
ever
have
with
me
only
do
not
i
beg
of
you
delude
yourself
with
the
idea
that
a
being
who
has
the
misfortune
to
possess
something
in
the
way
of
mind
and
soul
is
the
right
person
to
apply
to
for
sympathy
in
the
only
interests
you
seem
capable
the
extreme
contempt
the
insulting
scorn
of
her
words
and
manner
stung
him
to
the
quick
with
a
muttered
expression
of
some
kind
of
which
she
could
not
catch
the
words
he
turned
from
her
sharply
and
for
once
in
his
life
slammed
the
door
behind
him
violently
as
half
mad
with
misery
he
rushed
away
from
the
sound
of
her
cold
mocking
words
when
he
had
gone
marion
rose
from
her
seat
and
sauntered
to
the
window
she
stood
there
gazing
out
at
the
dreary
garden
desolate
and
bare
save
for
the
leaves
thickly
strewing
the
paths
and
beds
already
her
heart
was
reproaching
her
for
her
cruelty
already
her
conscience
was
bitterly
accusing
her
she
had
done
very
wrong
she
knew
she
owned
it
to
herself
but
she
could
not
feel
responsible
even
for
her
own
misdeeds
are
all
a
part
of
the
whole
she
cried
a
part
of
the
wretched
miserable
she
not
help
it
was
not
in
her
nature
to
be
good
when
she
was
i
am
no
more
to
blame
she
thought
defiantly
being
wicked
than
a
flower
for
not
blooming
without
but
does
the
poor
flower
resolutely
turn
from
the
light
does
it
not
rather
welcome
eagerly
each
narrow
ray
that
penetrates
to
its
dark
dwelling
and
with
humble
gratitude
make
the
most
of
the
sunshine
vouchsafed
to
it
later
marion
heard
a
clatter
in
the
direction
of
the
stables
voices
eager
and
clatter
the
dogs
barking
then
the
sound
of
a
feet
gradually
sobering
down
into
a
steady
pace
as
they
were
lost
in
the
distance
geoffrey
had
gone
out
riding
and
on
the
new
mare
the
footman
told
her
when
she
rang
for
coals
and
made
some
indirect
enquiry
handsome
she
is
added
he
very
awkward
at
starting
my
master
had
some
trouble
to
get
her
out
of
the
yard
she
took
fright
at
a
heap
of
bricks
lying
there
for
repairs
perhaps
you
heard
the
noise
said
marion
indifferently
thought
i
heard
the
dogs
in
her
heart
she
felt
rather
uneasy
she
wished
she
had
gone
out
with
her
husband
to
admire
his
favourite
she
wished
they
had
not
separated
with
such
angry
feelings
she
wished
he
had
not
chosen
for
trying
the
new
mare
she
put
on
her
hat
and
with
a
book
in
her
hand
ensconced
herself
in
a
sheltered
nook
which
after
some
difficulty
she
succeeded
in
finding
out
of
doors
it
felt
less
chilly
than
in
the
house
and
gradually
she
grew
soothed
and
calm
she
thought
to
herself
she
would
stay
out
them
for
some
hours
the
day
was
after
all
mild
and
pleasant
and
the
perfect
quiet
would
do
her
good
but
her
anticipations
were
doomed
to
be
disappointed
in
less
than
an
hour
she
heard
from
her
retreat
the
sound
of
approaching
then
voices
at
the
hall
door
and
in
a
few
minutes
james
appeared
breathless
in
hunting
for
her
in
all
her
usual
haunts
misses
copley
if
you
please
in
the
well
she
replied
half
provoked
and
yet
not
altogether
sorry
for
the
interruption
will
be
with
them
directly
the
young
ladies
you
said
miss
copley
and
miss
they
were
about
the
only
people
she
ever
cared
to
see
really
amiable
and
affectionate
and
yet
gentle
and
perfectly
unacquainted
with
her
previous
history
with
them
she
felt
on
safe
ground
they
liked
and
in
a
measure
understood
her
their
perceptions
were
not
of
the
quickest
they
had
no
idea
that
all
was
not
satisfactory
between
her
and
geoffrey
and
her
quiet
manner
did
not
to
appear
either
cold
or
proud
for
they
had
known
her
since
her
first
coming
to
mallingford
when
there
had
been
reason
enough
for
her
so
as
it
were
they
had
grown
accustomed
to
what
struck
strangers
as
chilling
and
repellent
besides
she
liked
them
and
felt
really
grateful
for
their
consistent
kindness
so
of
course
they
saw
her
to
advantage
this
morning
they
were
the
bearers
of
an
want
you
and
geoffrey
to
come
and
dine
with
us
and
stay
over
began
georgie
eagerly
and
then
margaret
took
up
the
you
must
come
tell
you
the
great
reason
is
coming
tonight
and
we
do
so
want
you
to
see
him
he
has
not
been
here
for
some
months
not
since
the
time
you
were
so
then
too
papa
has
some
draining
on
hand
he
wants
opinion
about
you
will
come
you
should
like
it
exceedingly
said
marion
cordially
but
as
to
geoffrey
i
say
he
has
gone
out
and
i
know
when
he
will
be
course
exclaimed
georgie
stupid
of
us
not
to
have
told
you
we
met
him
on
our
what
a
beautiful
mare
that
is
he
has
got
but
what
a
vixen
and
he
said
he
would
certainly
come
if
you
would
i
was
to
ask
you
to
order
his
man
to
put
up
what
clothes
he
will
want
as
he
said
he
would
not
return
here
unless
he
hears
at
the
wood
that
you
are
not
coming
so
all
right
it
bring
your
habit
do
an
age
since
had
a
ride
have
not
ridden
for
months
said
marion
since
i
was
ill
i
think
i
care
about
it
and
i
think
the
horse
geoffrey
intended
for
me
is
in
riding
could
ride
one
of
ours
suggested
margaret
but
thank
you
said
marion
resolutely
she
agreed
however
to
all
the
rest
of
their
proposals
and
in
an
hour
or
time
found
herself
with
her
friends
in
their
comfortable
carriage
bowling
briskly
along
the
to
copley
wood
in
far
better
spirits
than
early
that
morning
she
would
have
believed
she
could
possibly
attain
to
geoffrey
met
them
at
the
hall
door
and
handed
them
out
of
the
carriage
marion
fancied
he
looked
pale
though
he
began
talking
to
her
young
friends
as
brightly
as
usual
she
felt
grateful
for
their
presence
as
otherwise
their
meeting
after
the
scene
in
the
morning
could
not
but
have
been
uncomfortable
for
both
as
it
was
however
it
was
easy
to
avoid
any
approach
to
a
am
glad
you
have
come
he
said
rather
stiffly
this
was
the
only
approach
to
a
reconciliation
that
took
place
between
them
then
followed
a
hearty
welcome
from
kindly
cheery
lady
anne
and
the
old
squire
it
was
impossible
to
resist
altogether
the
genial
influence
of
the
whole
family
the
pleasant
atmosphere
of
goodwill
and
cordiality
pervading
the
dwelling
yet
even
with
this
there
was
mingled
for
marion
much
bitterness
i
be
happy
and
comfortable
like
these
kind
good
people
she
asked
herself
as
she
stood
by
the
bright
fire
in
the
pretty
and
glancing
round
took
in
all
the
details
of
the
pleasant
scene
the
old
portraits
on
the
walls
the
bookcases
with
their
tempting
contents
the
furniture
with
a
general
air
of
warmth
and
colour
about
it
though
sobered
down
by
time
and
use
to
the
quiet
hue
which
in
dull
houses
looks
dingy
in
cheerful
ones
comfortable
the
bits
of
work
and
newspapers
lying
about
the
fresh
flowers
on
the
two
pretty
girls
flitting
made
an
attractive
picture
geoffrey
seemed
to
enjoy
the
pleasant
influence
he
lay
back
lazily
in
his
chair
looking
up
laughingly
in
face
as
she
passed
him
his
hair
and
contrasting
eyes
contrasting
charmingly
with
the
little
darker
locks
and
quick
sparkling
glances
she
was
only
a
pretty
girl
little
georgie
copley
a
merry
robin
redbreast
sort
of
a
creature
who
by
no
imagination
could
be
idealised
into
a
beautiful
or
stately
woman
yet
for
one
little
moment
marion
felt
a
passing
pang
of
jealousy
of
the
happy
child
he
marry
her
she
thought
to
herself
would
have
suited
him
and
in
their
commonplace
way
they
would
have
been
happy
i
am
too
old
for
him
as
well
as
too
everything
and
with
a
slight
shiver
she
turned
round
to
the
fire
she
felt
herself
like
a
skeleton
at
the
feast
as
her
eyes
caught
the
reflection
of
her
face
in
the
mirror
above
the
mantelpiece
thin
and
pale
and
shadowy
she
looked
to
herself
with
large
eyes
from
which
all
the
lustre
and
richness
seemed
to
have
departed
closely
bound
round
the
small
drooping
head
in
her
best
days
she
never
had
been
nor
had
she
ever
been
inclined
to
do
justice
to
her
own
personal
charms
am
not
ugly
she
had
said
to
herself
as
a
young
girl
that
is
about
all
there
is
to
be
now
she
would
have
hesitated
to
say
even
as
much
some
one
else
was
watching
her
just
then
as
she
stood
quiet
and
apart
by
the
fire
someone
who
she
little
thought
was
thinking
of
her
at
all
some
one
who
as
he
chattered
merrily
to
georgie
was
hardly
conscious
of
any
other
presence
than
that
of
the
slight
drooping
figure
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
whose
bitter
sneering
words
of
the
morning
were
already
forgiven
and
if
not
forgotten
remembered
only
to
add
intensity
to
his
yearning
tenderness
of
pity
his
deep
enduring
love
then
came
the
announcement
of
luncheon
and
a
general
move
to
the
table
in
the
during
the
meal
plans
for
the
disposal
of
the
remainder
of
the
day
were
discussed
ferndale
be
here
much
before
georgie
said
her
sister
intend
to
stay
in
all
the
afternoon
i
hope
dear
no
replied
the
sensible
little
woman
intend
to
ride
with
you
and
geoffrey
unless
baldwin
will
change
her
mind
and
ride
my
horse
instead
of
me
will
you
marion
and
do
added
margaret
quite
sure
it
would
do
you
good
do
help
us
to
persuade
her
geoffrey
i
am
sure
i
have
a
habit
that
will
fit
but
geoffrey
only
glanced
at
his
wife
and
seeing
the
slight
annoyance
in
her
face
said
nothing
girls
tease
said
lady
anne
as
notwithstanding
evident
disinclination
to
make
one
of
the
riding
party
her
young
friends
still
attempted
to
persuade
her
to
change
her
mind
really
must
let
baldwin
decide
for
and
with
these
words
she
rose
and
led
the
way
back
to
the
reluctantly
margaret
and
georgie
gave
up
the
endeavour
and
went
to
dress
for
riding
geoffrey
strolled
to
the
stables
to
give
some
directions
respecting
the
saddling
of
his
beautiful
whose
behaviour
in
the
morning
had
decided
him
that
she
would
be
none
the
worse
for
a
little
more
exercise
have
some
trouble
to
get
her
sobered
down
a
bit
sir
said
the
old
coachman
a
little
afraid
miss
will
set
her
off
prince
is
fidgety
like
now
and
then
though
he
never
does
no
mischief
when
miss
riding
him
but
it
take
much
to
upset
this
mare
sir
young
and
flighty
though
handsome
as
a
be
careful
jackson
no
fear
but
what
take
it
out
of
her
said
geoffrey
tiresome
beside
the
young
ladies
give
her
a
gallop
across
country
to
settle
her
evidently
some
sedative
of
the
kind
was
likely
to
be
required
coquette
showed
the
greatest
reluctance
to
start
in
a
becoming
and
ladylike
manner
true
to
her
name
she
eyed
prince
with
evidently
mischievous
intentions
and
the
very
eccentric
manner
in
which
the
little
party
set
out
on
their
expedition
was
such
as
slightly
to
upset
even
lady
well
seasoned
nerves
marion
watched
the
departure
from
the
window
she
had
not
yet
exchanged
a
word
with
her
husband
since
the
painful
scene
of
the
morning
and
very
unreasonably
she
felt
inclined
to
be
angry
with
him
for
having
as
she
thought
given
her
no
opportunity
of
showing
that
she
regretted
the
unkindly
and
undignified
temper
to
which
she
had
given
way
she
felt
somewhat
uneasy
as
she
watched
the
peculiar
behaviour
of
the
new
mare
but
this
feeling
too
she
disguised
from
herself
by
turning
it
in
the
direction
of
annoyance
at
geoffrey
is
exceedingly
inconsiderate
indelicate
almost
of
him
she
said
to
herself
parade
in
this
way
his
complete
independence
of
any
sort
of
wifely
anxiety
i
believe
he
chooses
these
vicious
creatures
on
purpose
and
of
course
if
i
made
the
slightest
remonstrance
he
would
turn
on
me
with
taunts
that
i
had
no
right
to
interfere
that
to
me
his
personal
safety
must
be
a
matter
of
utter
indifference
evidently
he
now
despises
what
if
he
had
acted
differently
might
still
have
been
friendship
and
regard
but
he
really
need
not
go
out
of
his
way
to
exhibit
to
strangers
the
state
of
things
between
and
with
a
hard
look
on
her
face
she
turned
to
lady
anne
who
now
entered
the
room
chapter
a
wifely
welcome
love
is
great
the
littlest
doubts
are
fear
where
little
fears
grow
great
great
love
grows
shakespeare
much
like
that
horse
your
husband
is
riding
my
dear
said
lady
anne
as
she
sat
down
to
her
knitting
beside
the
all
very
well
young
men
riding
these
animals
breaking
them
in
and
so
on
but
geoffrey
is
no
longer
a
young
man
in
that
sense
of
the
word
his
neck
is
no
longer
his
own
property
he
has
you
to
think
of
think
you
must
scold
him
a
little
and
make
him
be
more
fear
i
could
do
little
good
my
dear
lady
anne
said
marion
as
lightly
as
she
could
see
bachelor
habits
are
not
so
easily
broken
through
it
will
take
some
time
to
teach
geoffrey
the
double
value
attached
to
his
well
said
the
elder
lady
suppose
it
would
be
rather
hard
on
a
man
to
give
up
what
has
always
been
his
great
amusement
you
may
be
thankful
my
dear
that
rash
riding
is
the
worst
that
you
will
ever
discover
in
your
husband
except
perhaps
smoking
geoffrey
does
smoke
rather
too
much
i
think
think
me
i
have
no
boys
at
home
now
i
take
a
great
interest
in
young
men
and
for
years
geoffrey
has
been
like
one
of
our
own
as
to
riding
yourself
you
are
very
wise
to
have
given
it
up
my
dear
the
girls
understand
you
see
of
course
poor
dears
it
would
not
occur
to
them
or
they
would
not
have
teased
you
so
but
you
are
very
wise
my
dear
very
wise
indeed
to
run
no
that
it
might
not
perhaps
do
no
harm
but
it
is
better
not
much
better
she
repeated
with
sundry
grandmotherly
nods
expressive
of
the
utmost
sagacity
marion
looked
up
with
extreme
mystification
quite
understand
you
lady
anne
she
said
am
not
the
least
nervous
about
riding
or
afraid
of
its
doing
me
harm
in
any
way
last
year
it
did
me
a
great
deal
of
good
it
is
only
that
just
lately
i
felt
quite
in
spirits
for
course
not
my
dear
it
is
quite
natural
you
should
not
feel
so
you
must
not
mind
me
my
dear
but
look
upon
me
in
the
light
of
a
mother
if
i
can
be
of
use
to
you
in
any
way
you
must
not
hesitate
to
ask
me
it
will
be
quite
a
pleasure
in
a
year
or
two
to
see
little
people
trotting
about
the
manor
will
brighten
up
the
old
place
and
geoffrey
is
so
fond
of
face
flushed
now
she
understood
the
good
mysterious
allusions
considerably
annoyed
and
yet
anxious
to
conceal
that
she
felt
so
she
replied
rather
stiffly
are
very
kind
lady
anne
but
i
assure
you
you
are
quite
mistaken
there
is
no
reason
of
the
kind
for
my
giving
up
lady
anne
looked
incredulous
and
before
marion
felt
sure
that
she
had
succeeded
in
convincing
her
of
the
truth
of
what
she
had
said
their
was
interrupted
but
it
had
given
a
new
turn
to
thoughts
never
before
in
the
few
unhappy
months
of
her
married
life
had
it
occurred
to
her
to
think
of
the
possibility
of
her
at
some
future
time
occupying
a
new
relation
the
sweetest
the
tenderest
of
of
a
mother
and
to
children
poor
geoffrey
he
was
fond
of
children

said
the
few
simple
words
softened
her
to
him
marvellously
she
began
to
wonder
if
such
a
tie
might
perhaps
draw
them
together
if
little
arms
and
innocent
baby
lips
might
have
power
to
achieve
what
at
present
seemed
a
hopeless
task
or
was
it
already
too
late
she
did
not
blame
him
in
her
gentle
womanly
mood
she
blamed
no
one
but
herself
it
was
her
own
doing
if
indeed
as
she
feared
it
was
the
case
that
her
husband
no
longer
loved
her
these
reflections
engrossed
her
during
the
quiet
afternoon
which
otherwise
she
might
have
found
dull
and
wearisome
she
felt
surprised
when
the
servant
appeared
with
afternoon
tea
and
lady
anne
waking
from
her
peaceful
slumber
in
her
began
to
remark
how
suddenly
it
had
got
dark
and
to
wonder
why
the
riding
party
had
not
yet
returned
ferndale
will
be
arriving
immediately
she
said
it
will
look
so
awkward
if
georgie
is
not
at
marion
looked
out
dark
as
yet
it
was
hardly
but
dusk
decidedly
much
such
an
afternoon
as
the
one
on
which
now
more
than
a
year
ago
geoffrey
had
first
ventured
to
tell
her
of
his
feelings
towards
her
which
confession
she
had
so
ungraciously
received
did
i
not
keep
to
what
i
said
then
she
asked
herself
much
better
for
both
of
us
had
i
done
so
poor
geoffrey
he
thought
me
cruel
then
how
much
more
reason
has
he
to
reproach
me
now
she
was
recalled
to
the
present
by
lady
voice
you
see
anything
of
them
my
dear
she
asked
said
marion
listeningly
but
almost
as
she
spoke
the
faint
clatter
of
approaching
feet
became
audible
they
are
she
exclaimed
and
a
certain
feeling
of
welcome
stole
into
her
heart
somehow
she
felt
anxious
to
be
to
geoffrey
to
make
up
to
him
for
the
hard
sneering
words
with
which
wish
she
ran
out
into
the
hall
to
receive
her
husband
and
the
two
girls
they
were
dismounting
as
she
reached
the
door
outside
it
looked
foggy
and
chilly
she
could
not
clearly
distinguish
either
horses
or
riders
are
rather
late
she
exclaimed
it
very
cold
how
has
coquette
been
behaving
it
was
voice
that
replied
is
that
you
marion
had
such
a
gallop
home
the
fog
came
on
so
suddenly
geoffrey
is
back
of
course
said
marion
in
surprise
should
he
be
back
before
you
no
he
has
not
come
i
was
asking
you
how
his
new
purchase
had
been
a
vixen
replied
georgie
if
i
were
a
gentleman
i
would
call
her
something
worse
prince
and
she
teazed
each
other
so
that
we
separated
geoffrey
said
he
would
come
home
by
the
fields
and
take
it
out
of
her
we
came
home
by
the
road
but
it
is
ever
so
long
ago
since
we
separated
and
he
said
he
would
be
home
long
before
us
what
can
he
be
about
a
strange
sensation
crept
over
marion
hardly
anxiety
hardly
apprehension
rather
a
sort
of
standing
still
of
her
whole
being
with
sudden
awe
sudden
terror
of
what
for
the
first
time
darted
into
her
imagination
as
the
possible
end
of
the
whole
the
solution
of
the
problem
of
her
like
a
picture
she
saw
it
all
before
her
as
if
by
magic
there
been
an
accident
geoffrey
was
killed
she
his
wife
no
longer
but
freed
by
this
awful
cutting
of
the
knot
from
the
bonds
which
had
galled
her
so
sorely
against
which
she
had
murmured
so
ceaselessly
but
was
it
a
feeling
of
relief
which
accompanied
the
vision
which
for
the
moment
she
believed
to
be
prophetic
was
it
not
rather
a
sensation
compared
to
which
all
her
past
sufferings
seemed
trivial
and
draught
of
that
bitterest
of
cups
of
which
it
is
given
to
us
poor
mortals
to
drink
unavailing
late
if
geoffrey
were
dead
it
seemed
to
her
his
wife
standing
there
and
remembering
all
that
she
and
she
alone
had
killed
him
she
said
not
a
word
in
perfect
silence
she
watched
margaret
and
georgie
gather
up
their
long
muddy
skirts
and
hasten
across
the
hall
peeping
in
as
they
passed
the
open
door
of
the
to
reassure
their
anxiety
she
followed
them
mechanically
heard
as
if
in
a
dream
lady
exclamations
of
concern
on
hearing
that
baldwin
was
not
with
them
and
while
the
good
lady
trotted
off
to
share
her
motherly
uneasiness
with
the
squire
at
this
time
of
day
always
ensconced
in
his
private
den
marion
crept
upstairs
to
the
room
in
which
but
a
few
hours
before
she
had
carelessly
thrown
off
her
hat
and
hurried
below
to
risk
no
chance
of
a
with
her
husband
her
evening
dress
lay
on
the
the
open
door
into
the
she
saw
by
the
firelight
as
yet
unopened
portmanteau
she
shuddered
as
it
caught
her
eye
would
he
ever
open
it
again
would
she
ever
again
hear
his
voice
see
his
stalwart
figure
and
fair
sunny
face
or
how
might
she
not
see
him
would
they
bring
him
home
pale
and
stiff
stretched
out
in
that
long
dreadful
way
she
had
once
or
twice
in
her
london
life
seen
a
something
that
had
been
a
man
carried
by
to
the
hospital
after
some
fatal
accident
or
worse
still
would
his
fair
hair
perhaps
be
dabbled
with
blood
his
blue
eyes
distorted
with
agony
his
beautiful
face
all
crushed
and
disfigured
ah
it
was
too
horrible
me
dear
geoffrey
forgive
me
she
said
in
her
remorse
as
if
her
words
could
reach
him
god
forgive
me
for
my
wickedness
and
do
not
punish
me
so
fearfully
for
how
can
i
live
how
endure
the
light
of
day
with
the
remembrance
of
what
i
have
done
crouched
by
the
fire
she
remained
thus
for
some
time
then
hearing
a
slight
bustle
in
the
hall
she
rose
and
went
out
into
the
vestibule
looking
over
the
staircase
to
see
what
was
taking
place
below
it
was
an
arrival
but
not
geoffrey
captain
ferndale
evidently
she
saw
little
georgie
fly
across
the
hall
followed
more
deliberately
by
margaret
and
her
mother
how
happy
they
all
seemed
had
they
forgotten
all
about
her
and
geoffrey
out
in
the
fog
alive
or
dead
nobody
seemed
to
care
but
she
wronged
them
captain
ferndale
was
hardly
welcomed
before
they
all
began
telling
him
of
their
anxiety
has
sent
out
men
in
all
directions
said
georgie
am
perfectly
certain
something
must
have
happened
the
horse
he
was
on
is
a
most
vicious
creature
i
was
frightened
out
of
my
wits
when
he
was
riding
beside
me
though
of
course
i
say
so
to
poor
marion
baldwin
you
know
fred
maggie
where
is
she
her
room
i
think
said
margaret
go
and
see
we
have
put
back
dinner
in
hopes
geoffrey
may
come
back
safe
and
sound
by
then
but
i
confess
i
am
very
marion
stole
back
to
her
room
and
was
sitting
there
quietly
when
in
a
minute
or
two
margaret
joined
her
has
not
come
in
yet
said
the
girl
cheerfully
as
she
entered
we
are
not
surprised
it
is
so
foggy
fred
ferndale
says
he
had
hard
work
to
get
here
from
the
marion
did
not
answer
margaret
put
her
arm
round
her
affectionately
but
marion
shrank
back
and
margaret
felt
a
little
chilled
are
not
uneasy
baldwin
she
said
kindly
but
a
little
more
stiffly
than
her
wont
know
your
husband
is
so
perfectly
to
be
depended
on
as
a
rider
he
is
sure
to
be
all
marion
looked
up
at
her
appealingly
think
me
cross
or
cold
margaret
and
call
me
baldwin
i
am
very
the
expression
was
a
curious
one
uneasy
alarmed
or
some
such
phrase
would
have
seemed
more
suited
to
the
circumstances
margaret
copley
felt
puzzled
after
all
there
was
something
very
peculiar
about
marion
baldwin
she
could
not
make
her
out
there
she
sat
staring
into
the
fire
pale
but
perfectly
calm
not
a
tear
not
a
symptom
of
nervousness
only
saying
in
that
quiet
deliberate
way
that
she
was
margaret
was
too
young
too
inexperienced
and
too
practically
ignorant
of
sorrow
to
detect
the
undertone
of
anguish
of
bitter
remorseful
misery
in
the
few
cold
am
very
marion
said
no
more
and
margaret
did
not
disturb
her
at
last
the
dinner
gong
sounded
marion
started
she
had
not
changed
her
dress
mind
said
margaret
down
as
you
are
unless
you
would
prefer
staying
up
no
said
marion
shall
dress
very
quickly
i
shall
be
ready
in
five
she
had
a
morbid
horror
of
appearing
affected
or
exaggerated
and
an
instinctive
determination
to
keep
her
feelings
to
herself
naturally
she
made
the
mistake
of
overdoing
her
part
she
dressed
quickly
went
downstairs
and
sat
through
the
long
weary
dinner
to
all
appearance
the
calmest
and
least
uneasy
of
the
party
one
after
another
of
the
grooms
and
gardeners
despatched
with
lanterns
in
various
directions
to
seek
the
truant
returned
after
a
fruitless
search
the
squire
grew
more
and
more
fidgety
lady
anne
was
all
but
in
and
georgie
unable
to
eat
any
dinner
marion
seemed
to
herself
to
be
standing
on
the
edge
of
a
fearful
precipice
down
which
she
dared
not
look
but
she
said
nothing
and
no
stranger
entering
the
company
would
have
imagined
that
she
of
all
the
party
was
the
one
most
chiefly
concerned
in
the
fate
of
geoffrey
baldwin
dinner
over
the
ladies
mechanically
adjourned
as
usual
to
the
lady
anne
and
margaret
sat
together
by
the
fire
talking
in
a
low
voice
marion
stayed
near
them
for
a
moment
but
lady
sort
of
tone
and
glances
in
her
direction
irritated
her
so
she
got
a
book
and
seated
herself
by
a
little
in
the
further
corner
of
the
room
georgie
ran
in
and
out
every
five
minutes
braving
the
cold
and
fog
at
the
to
peep
out
to
see
or
hear
rather
any
one
was
coming
like
sister
anne
in
the
grim
old
story
for
more
than
they
sat
thus
in
almost
unbroken
silence
the
squire
and
captain
ferndale
with
the
usual
manly
horror
of
an
impending
lingered
longer
than
usual
in
the
suddenly
georgie
darting
back
from
one
of
her
voyages
of
discovery
to
the
flew
into
the
exclaiming
excitedly
maggie
i
hear
a
horse
in
an
instant
they
all
jumped
up
and
followed
her
into
the
hall
the
door
was
wide
open
the
feet
were
heard
plainly
steadily
approaching
nearer
and
nearer
marion
remained
in
the
only
creeping
close
to
the
doorway
whence
she
could
both
hear
and
see
all
that
took
place
do
hope
it
is
all
right
said
lady
anne
earnestly
fred
for
by
this
time
the
gentlemen
had
joined
them
you
think
it
is
he
how
could
they
tell
poor
people
they
only
strained
their
eyes
vainly
endeavouring
to
pierce
the
darkness
thick
enough
as
the
country
folks
say
to
be
cut
with
a
knife
a
few
heads
appeared
at
the
doors
leading
to
the
back
regions
without
which
of
course
no
domestic
event
can
take
place
with
correct
decorum
the
scene
was
really
an
effective
one
the
feet
coming
nearer
and
nearer
the
little
group
in
the
old
hall
the
pale
face
of
the
poor
girl
peeping
out
from
the
doorway
thinking
and
feeling
so
much
that
none
of
those
about
her
had
the
slightest
conception
of
what
was
to
be
the
end
of
it
what
was
she
about
to
hear
five
minutes
more
suspense
it
seemed
to
her
she
could
not
have
endured
there
is
but
a
step
according
to
a
adage
between
the
sublime
and
the
ridiculous
thus
almost
could
marion
have
expressed
her
feelings
when
as
at
last
the
horse
drew
near
enough
for
the
rider
to
distinguish
the
anxious
faces
at
the
door
a
voice
out
of
the
darkness
reached
them
it
was
loud
and
cheery
it
sounded
i
am
safe
and
sound
a
nice
adventure
had
imagine
me
brentshire
born
and
bred
having
lost
my
way
in
this
horrible
i
am
so
glad
all
right
cried
georgie
clapping
her
hands
and
been
so
frightened
about
you
chimed
in
margaret
and
her
mother
the
squire
too
and
captain
ferndale
were
most
hearty
in
their
congratulations
likewise
several
members
of
the
hall
and
a
few
grooms
and
who
started
up
as
if
by
magic
to
lead
away
the
naughty
coquette
who
stood
there
in
the
fog
humble
and
subdued
enough
with
but
small
traces
of
the
mischievous
spirit
which
had
distinguished
her
departure
some
seven
hours
previously
for
the
moment
baldwin
was
made
quite
a
hero
of
as
he
stood
in
the
midst
of
the
group
damp
and
muddy
but
his
fair
face
flushed
and
eager
as
he
related
all
that
had
fallen
him
and
the
beauty
that
had
led
him
such
a
dance
everyone
was
intensely
relieved
at
the
comfortably
commonplace
end
to
the
adventure
which
had
caused
so
much
anxiety
everyone
was
most
sincere
and
hearty
in
their
congratulations
all
but
one
the
voice
which
alone
he
cared
to
hear
was
silent
he
looked
round
eagerly
and
enquiringly
wife
marion
he
said
still
here
i
had
better
go
to
tell
her
i
am
all
yes
said
margaret
rather
awkwardly
will
go
and
tell
her
but
we
have
not
let
her
know
how
uneasy
we
have
been
she
has
not
therefore
been
you
said
geoffrey
but
on
his
heart
the
words
fell
with
a
strange
chill
had
not
been
alarmed
this
wife
of
his
it
had
been
then
so
easy
to
prevent
her
feeling
anxiety
about
him
that
even
this
girl
a
stranger
almost
to
her
felt
instinctively
that
the
extreme
coolness
of
the
young
wife
at
such
a
time
called
loudly
for
some
sort
of
excuse
some
palliation
of
what
to
those
about
her
had
evidently
looked
very
like
utter
heartlessness
and
indifference
to
his
fate
only
they
knew
the
whole
he
said
to
himself
would
not
wonder
at
her
unnatural
behaviour
about
me
no
indeed
the
saddest
sight
that
can
meet
her
eyes
will
be
my
returning
alive
and
and
with
this
bitterness
in
his
heart
he
followed
margaret
to
the
in
quest
of
marion
what
evil
spirit
of
pride
and
unlovely
perversity
had
been
whispering
to
her
and
why
oh
why
had
she
listened
to
its
voice
wilfully
stifling
the
pleadings
of
her
gentle
heart
and
deliberately
destroying
what
might
have
been
the
happy
softening
influences
of
the
occurrences
much
doubtless
of
the
miserable
state
of
things
between
these
two
bound
together
by
the
closest
most
sacred
of
ties
not
to
be
blamed
for
only
name
we
in
our
ignorance
can
find
for
the
mysterious
combinations
which
destroy
the
lives
of
so
in
great
part
were
the
in
the
case
of
the
great
mistake
of
life
she
had
meant
to
do
right
poor
child
and
had
tried
her
best
to
execute
her
intention
terrible
mistakes
we
are
all
apt
to
make
the
wisest
of
us
perhaps
more
than
the
humbler
and
less
confident
but
for
such
though
the
temporal
punishment
is
often
disproportionately
heavy
in
higher
tribunals
we
are
leniently
judged
not
so
with
deliberate
acts
of
cruelty
and
unkindness
to
each
other
such
as
marion
baldwin
was
this
evening
guilty
of
she
knew
what
she
was
about
she
knew
though
possibly
she
would
not
have
owned
it
to
herself
that
she
wished
to
wound
geoffrey
deliberately
meant
and
intended
to
punish
for
some
offence
towards
herself
which
she
would
have
found
it
difficult
to
define
the
heart
whose
only
blame
if
blame
it
were
was
its
too
great
devotion
to
her
she
was
angry
with
herself
for
having
been
frightened
about
him
mortified
though
yet
her
relief
was
real
at
the
conclusion
of
what
she
had
been
picturing
to
herself
as
a
crisis
in
her
fate
so
after
the
manner
of
people
when
angry
with
themselves
she
did
her
best
to
make
another
as
unhappy
as
herself
when
geoffrey
entered
the
and
margaret
copley
with
instinctive
delicacy
withdrew
he
did
not
at
first
perceive
that
his
wife
was
present
in
another
moment
however
he
caught
sight
of
her
seated
at
the

in
the
furthest
corner
of
the
room
apparently
engrossed
in
a
book
his
heart
throbbed
with
disappointment
wounded
feeling
and
even
some
mixture
of
indignation
but
he
controlled
himself
and
determined
to
give
her
a
chance
he
said
am
going
to
take
off
my
wet
things
but
i
have
just
looked
in
to
tell
you
i
am
all
right
you
heard
me
come
just
now
i
suppose
lady
anne
and
all
the
others
were
at
the
door
to
meet
me
afraid
i
have
given
you
all
a
very
uncomfortable
evening
but
it
was
fault
not
mine
however
well
that
ends
well
and
i
flatter
myself
the
beauty
has
had
a
lesson

he
went
on
speaking
in
a
half
nervous
manner
for
marion
did
not
appear
at
first
to
hear
him
when
he
left
off
she
raised
her
eyes
from
her
book
and
said
in
the
provokingly
indifferent
tone
of
a
person
still
engrossed
in
the
pages
from
which
the
attention
is
hardly
withdrawn
beg
your
pardon
geoffrey
i
did
not
hear
you
come
into
the
room
was
it
i
you
were
speaking
to
yes
i
heard
your
horse
come
up
to
the
door
what
a
fuss
lady
anne
gets
into
for
nothing
at
all
you
better
go
and
change
your
things
and
without
giving
him
time
to
reply
her
eyes
were
again
bent
on
her
book
geoffrey
looked
at
her
for
a
moment
without
speaking
she
felt
his
gaze
fixed
on
her
she
felt
though
he
could
not
see
the
expression
of
his
face
almost
she
felt
inclined
to
spring
up
and
run
towards
him
to
ask
his
forgiveness
to
tell
him
of
the
anxiety
she
had
endured
the
genuine
relief
she
had
experienced
when
she
heard
of
his
safe
return
he
would
not
believe
you
whispered
the
evil
spirit
she
had
been
listening
to
lower
yourself
thus
unnecessarily
to
one
who
no
longer
cares
for
you
and
marion
gave
heed
to
the
specious
suggestion
and
the
opportunity
faded
away
into
the
mournful
crowd
of
things
that
might
have
deeds
never
done
loving
words
never
spoken
the
remainder
of
their
visit
at
copley
wood
passed
quietly
and
uneventfully
but
marion
was
glad
when
it
came
to
an
end
she
felt
that
she
had
fallen
back
in
her
good
opinion
evidently
they
too
thought
her
heartless
and
disagreeable
cold
and
selfish
reserved
to
an
unwomanly
degree
all
these
epithets
she
piled
on
herself
in
reality
the
copleys
margaret
especially
thought
of
her
much
more
kindly
than
she
imagined
they
did
not
could
not
indeed
understand
her
few
things
are
more
hopeless
than
any
approach
to
mutual
comprehension
between
the
happy
and
the
miserable
the
happy
that
is
to
say
in
the
sense
in
which
these
inexperienced
girls
may
be
called
so
happy
in
utter
unconsciousness
of
the
reverse
of
the
picture
thoughtless
in
the
innocent
war
in
which
birds
and
lambs
and
flowers
are
thoughtless
but
still
they
were
gentle
judging
and
what
in
character
and
behaviour
they
could
not
understand
they
pitied
and
treated
tenderly
the
depth
of
feeling
in
the
few
words
wife
had
addressed
to
margaret
that
evening
by
the
fire
am
very
unhappy
rang
in
the
young
ears
and
emboldened
her
to
speak
kindly
in
her
defence
when
as
was
often
the
case
for
in
country
society
people
must
talk
about
their
neighbours
or
else
be
altogether
silent
young
peculiarities
were
discussed
and
that
not
in
the
most
amiable
of
terms
from
this
time
geoffrey
and
his
wife
lived
yet
more
independently
of
each
other
than
before
one
improvement
took
place
in
their
relations
though
after
all
i
hardly
know
that
it
merits
to
be
thus
described
there
was
an
end
henceforth
of
all
stormy
scenes
between
them
so
much
marion
had
resolved
upon
coldness
and
mutual
indifference
were
evidently
to
be
the
order
of
their
lives
let
it
be
so
she
decided
it
was
to
the
full
as
much
doing
as
hers
but
at
least
she
would
show
herself
his
equal
in
the
tacit
compact
she
would
not
again
lower
herself
by
losing
her
temper
and
condescending
to
such
aggressive
weapons
as
sarcasm
or
recrimination
to
the
letter
of
the
law
she
determined
in
her
pride
she
would
do
her
duty
by
him
so
that
in
after
days
come
what
might
she
need
never
reproach
herself
with
any
on
her
side
and
geoffrey
for
his
part
if
she
should
be
so
fortunate
as
die
and
leave
him
free
to
choose
a
more
congenial
might
at
least
remember
her
with
respect
if
with
no
warmer
feeling
foolish
presumptuous
child
in
the
terrible
which
the
slight
experience
she
had
had
the
evening
of
misadventure
in
the
fog
had
profited
her
so
those
days
letter
of
the
law
fulfilled
as
no
fallible
mortal
yet
fulfilled
it
would
bring
with
its
remembrance
sorry
comfort
very
that
the
swine
do
eat
nay
worse
mocking
gibbering
fiends
to
torment
us
are
in
those
days
the
memories
of
proudly
and
perfectly
but
unlovingly
performed
acts
of
obedience
submission
even
however
outwardly
without
the
spirit
which
alone
gives
them
value
doubtless
we
all
fall
short
in
our
relations
taken
to
each
other
never
yet
was
the
coffin
lid
closed
on
the
dead
face
of
a
human
being
but
what
in
the
hearts
of
those
who
had
taken
their
last
look
pressed
their
last
kiss
on
the
pale
might
be
the
smooth
fair
brow
of
a
child
it
might
be
the
withered
furrowed
face
of
a
man
or
rose
reproachful
ghosts
of
things
they
might
have
done
for
the
dead
or
more
grievous
still
others
they
would
now
give
much
to
have
left
undone
but
it
is
not
at
such
times
the
thought
of
sharp
hasty
words
repented
of
as
soon
as
spoken
or
of
unkind
deeds
done
in
the
heat
of
passion
and
in
saner
moments
atoned
for
with
all
the
earnestness
we
can
command
it
is
not
the
recollection
of
such
things
as
these
that
stings
us
the
most
deeply
far
more
terrible
and
overwhelming
when
we
gaze
on
the
dead
face
in
its
silent
reproach
is
the
memory
of
deliberate
long
course
of
studied
repellent
coldness
wrongs
fancied
or
real
cherished
and
brooded
over
instead
of
forgiven
and
forgotten
duties
even
performed
while
yet
love
was
withheld

time
went
on
as
it
always
does
through
weal
and
woe
bright
days
and
dull
but
this
winter
was
weary
work
to
marion
baldwin
worse
far
worse
to
bear
she
constantly
said
to
herself
than
the
previous
one
spent
mallingford
at
the
cross
house
then
at
least
though
she
had
much
to
endure
she
had
been
free
from
the
reproaches
of
her
conscience
which
now
for
all
her
endeavours
to
silence
it
would
yet
at
times
insist
on
being
heard
geoffrey
though
she
saw
him
but
seldom
in
the
day
constantly
haunted
her
thoughts
she
fancied
she
perceived
a
change
in
him
his
manner
was
the
gentle
but
never
more
but
the
sorrow
of
his
life
was
beginning
to
tell
on
him
physically
he
was
fast
losing
heart
altogether
as
day
by
day
he
became
more
convinced
of
the
hopelessness
of
ever
attempting
to
win
back
the
wife
who
indeed
had
never
been
his
yet
she
was
gentler
more
cordial
even
than
she
had
been
to
him
always
ready
to
agree
to
his
wishes
much
less
irritable
anxious
evidently
to
do
her
by
him
she
thought
sincerely
enough
that
he
was
wearied
of
her
that
it
was
too
late
to
convince
him
that
in
her
loneliness
she
was
fast
learning
to
prize
the
love
and
devotion
which
when
hers
she
had
so
rudely
repulsed
for
she
was
truly
very
desolate
at
this
time
she
was
pining
for
affection
yearning
for
companionship
the
remembrance
of
ralph
was
growing
to
be
to
her
as
the
memory
of
the
dead
soft
and
chastened
shrined
about
with
a
sacredness
of
its
own
but
no
longer
agonizing
and
acute
she
had
grown
so
thoroughly
to
realize
that
she
should
never
see
him
again
that
he
was
utterly
and
for
ever
cut
out
of
her
life
that
the
inward
strife
and
rebellion
were
at
an
end
she
bowed
her
head
in
submission
standing
by
the
grave
of
her
lost
love
and
in
heart
said
a
last
voluntary
farewell
to
the
beautiful
dream
of
her
girlhood
she
could
never
forget
him
or
in
any
sense
replace
him
by
another
he
was
still
and
for
ever
must
remain
a
part
of
herself
of
her
whole
existence
an
impalpable
an
indefinable
and
wholly
immaterial
bond
yet
at
times
seemed
to
rivet
her
spirit
to
his
and
never
was
she
so
at
peace
as
when
she
felt
most
conscious
of
this
still
existing
sympathy
a
consciousness
altogether
superior
to
the
limitations
of
time
or
the
tidings
of
his
death
would
in
no
wise
have
certainty
that
the
noblest
part
of
their
natures
was
still
and
ever
would
be
united
that
in
the
purest
and
most
exquisite
sense
he
still
loved
her
still
cared
for
her
well
being
it
was
to
her
precisely
as
if
he
had
long
been
dead
his
own
words
had
foreshadowed
this
if
one
of
us
were
dying
to
some
extent
he
had
foreseen
how
it
would
be
with
to
her
sensitive
imaginative
nature
his
thus
dying
to
her
fading
softly
out
of
her
life
was
the
gentlest
form
in
which
the
stroke
could
come
for
she
was
not
the
sort
of
woman
call
it
what
you
will
who
could
ever
have
come
to
look
upon
him
personally
as
only
a
friend
to
have
associated
with
him
in
a
comfortable
fashion
possibly
to
have
attained
to
a
sisterly
regard
for
his
wife
in
no
wise
diminished
by
the
gratifying
reflection
that
really
she
is
a
nice
creature
my
dear
lady
severn
was
not
sir
first
ralph
had
foreseen
more
her
nature
though
and
far
from
weakly
was
too
clinging
too
not
in
time
to
turn
in
its
outward
loneliness
and
desolation
to
the
shelter
and
support
if
indeed
countenance
did
not
belie
his
character
only
too
ready
to
welcome
it
so
much
ralph
had
read
and
correctly
enough
of
the
probable
future
and
therefore
as
we
have
seen
even
amidst
his
own
supremest
suffering
had
ventured
to
predict
moonlight
for
his
darling
but
he
had
not
could
he
have
done
so
side
influences
the
disturbing
elements
in
the
way
physical
prostration
at
the
time
which
had
rendered
it
much
harder
for
her
to
act
with
her
usual
unselfishness
and
her
monotonous
uninteresting
unoccupied
life
at
the
manor
farm
where
partly
through
circumstances
partly
through
mistaken
kindness
in
sparing
her
every
species
of
care
or
responsibility
all
tended
to
foster
her
morbid
clinging
to
the
past
nothing
drew
her
to
healthy
interest
in
the
present
above
all
ralph
had
by
no
means
taken
sufficiently
into
account
personal
share
in
the
whole
he
had
thought
of
him
as
a
fine
honest
fellow
devoted
in
his
way
to
his
wife
ready
as
she
herself
had
said
in
other
words
to
do
anything
for
her
happiness
true
he
had
had
misgivings
as
to
the
effect
of
extending
her
confidence
to
her
husband
he
had
thought
it
was
only
too
probable
that
her
doing
so
might
for
a
time
at
least
have
unhappy
results
but
he
had
by
no
means
felt
certain
that
she
would
feel
it
her
duty
to
tell
more
than
she
had
already
before
her
marriage
confided
to
him
and
even
in
the
event
of
her
doing
so
he
had
not
realized
the
manner
in
which
it
would
act
on
the
young
nature
few
indeed
even
of
those
most
intimately
acquainted
with
geoffrey
baldwin
could
have
done
so
these
sunny
gleeful
natures
are
often
to
the
full
as
grievously
misunderstood
as
their
less
attractive
graver
and
apparently
more
reserved
neighbours
oh
what
fools
we
are
in
our
superficial
presumptuous
judgments
of
each
other
may
not
the
sunlight
dance
on
the
surface
of
the
stream
without
our
forthwith
pronouncing
its
waters
shallow
is
there
not
latent
in
the
blackest
coldest
iron
a
vast
power
of
heat
and
light
miss
veronica
was
absent
from
mallingford
the
greater
part
of
this
winter
her
general
health
had
been
less
satisfactory
of
late
and
after
much
consideration
it
had
been
decided
that
the
coldest
months
must
be
spent
by
her
in
a
milder
climate
in
a
sense
her
absence
was
a
relief
to
both
her
friends
it
was
becoming
hard
work
to
attempt
to
deceive
her
as
to
the
true
state
of
things
at
the
manor
farm
her
loving
scrutiny
was
more
painful
to
marion
than
the
cold
formality
of
the
generality
of
her
acquaintances
more
unendurable
the
thought
of
her
distress
and
anxiety
than
even
the
consciousness
of
the
gossiping
curiosity
with
which
the
young
wife
felt
instinctively
she
was
elsewhere
discussed
yet
she
murmured
sometimes
not
a
little
at
this
separation
from
the
only
friend
she
could
really
rely
on
but
then
in
these
days
marion
baldwin
murmured
inwardly
at
least
at
everything
in
her
life
there
were
times
when
she
felt
so
desperate
with
ennui
and
at
what
she
believed
to
be
her
indifference
to
her
that
she
said
to
herself
if
only
veronica
were
attainable
she
would
break
through
her
reserve
and
tell
her
all
most
probably
had
the
resolution
been
possible
to
execute
she
would
have
changed
her
mind
before
she
was
half
way
to
miss
cottage
one
day
at
luncheon
geoffrey
to
her
surprise
told
her
a
gentleman
was
coming
to
dinner
she
felt
considerably
amazed
and
a
little
indignant
it
was
not
often
any
guest
joined
to
any
extent
not
being
expected
of
a
young
couple
in
the
first
months
of
their
married
life
and
the
couple
in
question
being
only
too
ready
to
avail
themselves
of
the
conventional
excuse
as
long
as
they
could
with
decency
do
the
few
times
on
which
their
meal
had
been
interrupted
geoffrey
had
given
her
plenty
of
notice
had
even
seemed
to
make
a
favour
on
her
side
of
her
receiving
any
friend
of
his
however
he
did
nothing
of
the
sort
hence
her
indignation
at
what
she
imagined
to
be
a
new
proof
of
neglect
and
indifference
in
a
somewhat
abrupt
manner
he
made
his
unexpected
announcement
true
to
her
determination
that
on
her
side
there
should
be
no
shortcoming
she
answered
quietly
enough
though
at
heart
by
no
means
as
unmoved
as
she
appeared
well
i
suppose
you
have
told
parker
do
you
wish
me
to
be
at
dinner
he
looked
up
slightly
surprised
then
answered
rather
shortly
as
had
of
late
become
a
habit
with
him
course
why
not
i
never
thought
of
your
not
being
at
well
she
replied
again
but
added
rather
this
case
perhaps
you
will
tell
me
the
name
it
might
be
awkward
for
me
not
to
have
heard
all
this
time
attention
had
been
greatly
engrossed
by
several
letters
printed
reports
which
he
had
been
reading
as
he
eat
his
luncheon
for
a
minute
or
two
he
made
no
reply
seemed
not
to
have
heard
her
question
a
trifling
neglect
which
marion
in
her
present
frame
of
mind
found
peculiarly
irritating
she
sat
perfectly
still
but
no
answer
being
apparently
forthcoming
she
having
finished
her
luncheon
rose
quietly
to
leave
the
room
and
had
the
in
her
hand
before
geoffrey
noticed
that
she
had
left
the
table
the
noise
of
the
door
opening
roused
him
beg
your
pardon
he
said
hastily
starting
up
spoke
to
me
it
was
very
rude
of
me
but
i
did
not
pay
attention
to
what
you
said
please
tell
me
what
it
was
of
no
consequence
thank
you
replied
marion
coldly
as
she
swept
past
him
and
crossed
the
hall
to
the
this
was
how
silly
child
she
performed
her
wifely
part
to
the
very
letter
of
the
law
but
geoffrey
followed
her
after
delaying
a
few
moments
to
collect
the
papers
in
which
he
had
been
so
absorbed
and
carry
them
for
safety
to
his
private
den
this
was
at
the
other
side
of
the
house
so
two
or
three
minutes
passed
before
he
gently
opened
the
door
intending
to
apologise
still
more
earnestly
to
his
wife
for
his
inattention
marion
was
sitting
on
the
rug
before
the
fire
for
though
it
was
now
early
spring
it
was
very
chilly
her
face
he
could
not
at
first
see
it
was
hidden
by
her
hands
but
the
slight
noise
he
made
on
coming
in
disturbed
her
she
looked
up
hastily
with
rather
an
angry
light
in
her
eyes
imagining
it
was
the
servant
entering
with
the
everlasting
excuse
of
at
the
fire
and
feeling
annoyed
at
the
intrusion
but
when
she
saw
it
was
her
husband
her
expression
changed
and
without
speaking
she
quickly
turned
her
face
aside
not
so
quickly
though
but
what
geoffrey
perceived
what
she
wished
to
conceal
she
was
crying
it
was
the
first
time
since
their
marriage
he
had
seen
her
shed
tears
what
different
tales
that
simple
little
sentence
may
tell
it
smote
him
to
the
heart
with
da
sudden
impulse
he
approached
her
and
stooped
down
gently
laying
his
hand
on
her
shoulder
poor
child
he
said
with
all
the
tenderness
in
his
voice
that
the
words
could
contain
me
you
have
enough
to
bear
without
my
boorishness
wounding
you
so
her
tears
fell
faster
but
she
did
not
shrink
from
his
touch
she
felt
ashamed
of
her
petulance
and
childishness
is
not
that
she
said
at
last
trying
to
repress
her
sobs
my
rudeness
that
has
vexed
you
so
asked
geoffrey
gently
but
feeling
already
a
slight
premonitory
chill
you
must
not
think
me
so
silly
she
replied
she
hesitated
he
persisted
i
tell
you
she
exclaimed
passionately
is
not
any
one
thing
it
is
just
said
geoffrey
with
a
whole
world
of
mingled
feeling
in
his
voice
i
feared
so
poor
child
he
said
again
but
with
more
of
bitterness
than
tenderness
this
time
my
pity
i
suppose
would
be
odious
to
you
otherwise
i
might
be
fool
enough
to
show
you
how
genuine
it
is
but
it
is
better
and
he
was
turning
away
when
her
voice
recalled
him
no
she
cried
be
so
hard
think
how
very
lonely
i
am
how
friendless
however
i
may
have
tried
you
however
you
may
think
i
have
deceived
you
surely
my
utter
loneliness
and
wretchedness
should
soften
you
to
me
i
want
your
pity
i
want
what
now
it
is
too
late
to
ask
know
it
is
too
late
i
know
that
you
would
hate
me
only
you
are
good
and
so
you
but
i
bear
you
to
speak
so
hardly
and
her
sobs
broke
out
more
wildly
every
word
she
had
uttered
was
a
fresh
stab
to
geoffrey
interpreted
by
him
as
it
was
but
he
controlled
his
own
feelings
and
spoke
very
gently
to
the
poor
child
in
her
sore
distress
me
if
what
i
said
sounded
hard
and
hitter
marion
heaven
knows
i
am
far
from
ever
intending
to
hurt
you
it
is
as
you
say
too
late
to
undo
what
is
done
but
do
not
make
things
worse
by
fancying
i
would
ever
intentionally
add
by
even
a
word
to
all
you
suffer
do
me
justice
at
least
so
much
i
think
i
have
a
right
to
his
words
were
gentle
but
cold
sobs
grew
quiet
and
her
tears
ceased
she
was
hurt
but
her
pride
forbade
her
to
show
it
except
by
silence
in
a
moment
geoffrey
spoke
again
in
a
different
tone
were
asking
me
i
think
he
said
name
of
the
gentleman
who
is
coming
to
dine
here
i
should
have
told
you
before
but
i
did
not
know
it
myself
till
an
hour
or
two
ago
when
i
met
him
accidentally
in
mallingford
it
is
wrexham
my
successor
in
the
bank
you
remember
my
telling
you
about
him
perhaps
very
wealthy
they
say
he
is
what
he
cares
to
be
a
banker
for
passes
my
has
never
been
here
before
asked
marion
this
house
no
and
i
would
not
have
asked
him
now
for
i
like
the
man
but
that
i
want
to
have
some
talk
with
him
i
have
called
a
dozen
times
at
the
bank
in
the
last
week
or
two
but
have
never
found
him
in
so
when
i
met
him
and
he
began
apologising
i
cut
him
short
by
asking
him
to
dinner
and
saying
we
could
talk
over
our
business
after
it
seemed
to
me
he
did
not
want
to
come
but
he
had
no
excuse
ready
i
make
him
you
are
no
longer
a
partner
in
the
bank
are
you
asked
marion
a
sort
of
a
way
i
am
still
said
geoffrey
is
just
what
i
want
to
see
wrexham
about
through
your
other
guardian
framley
vere
i
have
heard
of
a
very
good
investment
both
for
your
and
i
part
of
my
own
so
i
want
to
see
about
withdrawing
some
of
my
capital
from
the
old
bank
i
have
a
right
to
do
so
at
any
time
with
proper
notice
and
so
on
last
year
wrexham
urged
my
doing
so
very
much
just
then
it
was
not
very
convenient
but
now
that
i
wish
to
do
it
there
seems
some
difficulty
which
i
make
out
i
have
never
got
hold
of
wrexham
himself
so
you
understand
why
i
am
anxious
to
see
him
to
all
intents
and
purposes
he
is
the
head
of
the
concern
you
like
him
said
marion
know
said
geoffrey
reasons
for
disliking
him
would
sound
very
silly
if
i
put
them
in
words
and
yet
to
myself
they
seem
so
he
is
oily
and
too
ready
too
marion
half
laughed
that
is
a
queer
fault
to
find
with
a
business
man
she
said
i
know
it
is
said
geoffrey
the
sentence
was
never
completed
a
ring
at
the
bell
made
baldwin
take
flight
in
terror
lest
it
should
be
the
announcement
of
visitors
whom
with
the
evident
traces
of
recent
tears
on
her
face
she
felt
anything
but
prepared
to
meet
she
need
not
have
been
afraid
it
was
only
squire
copley
who
had
walked
over
to
discuss
drains
with
geoffrey
so
she
was
left
undisturbed
for
the
rest
of
the
afternoon
she
felt
brighter
and
happier
the
little
conversation
with
geoffrey
confined
thought
it
had
been
almost
entirely
to
business
matters
had
yet
done
her
good
taken
her
a
little
out
of
herself
given
her
a
not
unpleasant
feeling
that
notwithstanding
all
that
had
occurred
to
separate
them
they
had
yet
must
have
husband
and
wife
as
they
were
some
interest
in
common
some
ground
on
which
from
time
to
time
they
were
likely
to
meet
any
thought
she
better
than
none
even
though
it
be
only
the
unromantic
one
of
money
tone
at
the
commencement
of
their
conversation
had
somewhat
puzzled
her
transparent
as
she
imagined
him
she
was
beginning
to
find
him
sometimes
difficult
to
read
if
he
were
tired
of
her
worn
out
by
her
coldness
and
moodiness
as
she
had
begun
to
fancy
could
he
would
he
not
be
more
than
human
to
address
her
with
the
intense
tenderness
which
this
afternoon
had
breathed
through
his
whole
words
and
manner
on
the
other
hand
was
it
not
more
than
could
be
expected
of
any
man
save
an
exceptionally
deep
and
adhesive
character
as
for
instance
she
said
to
herself
that
through
all
that
had
happened
all
the
bitter
disappointment
and
mortification
he
should
yet
continue
to
care
for
to
love
such
a
wife
or
rather
no
wife
as
she
been
to
him
he
had
echoed
without
she
fancied
fully
comprehending
her
own
words
is
too
was
it
too
late
or
could
it
be
that
even
yet
even
now
in
what
she
felt
to
be
in
a
figurative
sense
the
autumn
of
her
life
there
was
rising
before
her
a
possibility
such
as
she
had
been
indignant
with
brave
unselfish
ralph
for
predicting
nay
urging
on
her
a
possibility
of
happiness
chastened
and
tempered
but
none
the
less
real
on
this
account
for
herself
and
for
the
man
to
whom
she
was
bound
by
the
closest
and
most
sacred
of
ties
and
of
better
than
harmony
and
meaning
in
her
life
of
living
rather
than
mere
enduring
of
existence
of
duties
to
do
and
suffering
to
bear
both
sanctified
and
rendered
beautiful
by
love
could
it
be
that
such
things
were
yet
in
store
for
her
she
could
hardly
believe
it
yet
as
she
remembered
look
and
voice
her
heart
yearned
within
her
and
the
tears
again
welled
up
to
her
eyes
but
softly
and
without
bitterness
or
burning
all
that
afternoon
till
it
grew
dark
she
sat
by
the
fire
in
her
and
hoping
as
she
had
not
been
able
to
do
for
long
though
pale
and
wearied
looking
there
was
a
gentle
light
and
brightness
about
her
that
evening
very
pleasant
for
geoffrey
to
see
it
reminded
him
of
the
days
when
he
first
knew
more
of
the
first
days
of
their
married
life
and
though
the
remembrance
brought
with
it
a
sigh
it
too
was
less
bitter
than
tender
and
his
voice
was
very
gentle
that
evening
when
he
had
occasion
to
speak
to
his
young
wife
wrexham
duly
made
his
appearance
first
impression
of
him
was
unfavourable
she
felt
quite
ready
to
echo
indefinite
expressions
of
dislike
but
later
in
the
evening
she
somewhat
modified
her
first
opinion
he
was
so
clever
and
amusing
so
thoroughly
in
all
the
subjects
of
the
day
from
the
last
novel
to
debate
that
she
felt
really
interested
and
refreshed
by
his
conversation
it
was
more
the
sort
of
talk
she
had
been
accustomed
to
in
her
house
and
which
as
far
as
her
experience
went
was
by
no
means
indigenous
to
brentshire
where
the
ideas
seldom
extended
beyond
and
varied
occasionally
by
a
dip
into
drains
and
such
like
interests
and
where
the
still
narrower
minds
of
the
women
rotated
among
servants
and
babies
descriptions
at
second
or
third
hand
of
the
probable
fashions
and
gossip
not
unfrequently
verging
on
something
very
like
downright
scandal
wrexham
seemed
at
home
on
every
subject
and
in
every
direction
certainly
his
personal
appearance
was
against
him
and
the
fact
that
in
five
time
it
ceased
to
impress
his
companions
disagreeably
in
itself
says
a
good
deal
for
his
cleverness
and
tact
he
was
and
stout
and
somewhat
flabby
a
large
head
with
a
bare
bald
forehead
such
as
many
people
take
as
a
guarantee
of
brains
and
benevolence
small
twinkling
eyes
a
preponderance
of
jaw
and
mouth
and
a
pair
of
fat
white
and
yet
determined
looking
these
do
not
make
up
an
attractive
whole
but
he
talked
away
his
own
ugliness
and
talked
himself
with
that
round
full
voice
of
his
into
his
young
good
graces
in
a
really
wonderful
way
he
did
not
flatter
her
he
was
far
too
clever
to
make
such
a
mistake
he
appealed
to
her
knowledge
of
the
subjects
they
were
conversing
about
in
a
way
far
more
insidiously
gratifying
to
a
sensible
and
intellectual
woman
once
or
twice
as
if
inadvertently
he
alluded
to
her
father
the
loss
the
country
had
sustained
in
his
premature
death
the
immense
veneration
he
wrexham
had
always
felt
for
him
though
not
personally
acquainted
with
the
great
man
and
so
on
so
delicately
and
judiciously
that
dislike
was
perfectly
overcome
and
she
mentally
resolved
never
again
to
trust
to
first
impressions
after
dinner
as
she
expected
the
gentlemen
sat
long
in
the
she
was
growing
tired
and
sleepy
when
they
joined
her
face
she
was
glad
to
see
looked
brighter
and
less
anxious
than
it
had
appeared
during
dinner
wrexham
had
evidently
the
faculty
of
talking
business
as
pleasantly
as
everything
else
for
his
manner
to
him
had
decidedly
increased
in
cordiality
were
just
talking
of
miss
temple
in
the
other
room
began
wrexham
am
delighted
to
find
how
intimate
a
friend
of
yours
she
is
baldwin
a
charming
really
charming
person
she
must
be
how
terribly
abused
that
word
often
is
i
have
not
the
pleasure
of
knowing
her
personally
but
her
books
make
one
feel
as
if
she
were
a
personal
books
repeated
marion
in
surprise
books
i
never
knew
she
had
written
any
did
you
geoffrey
yes
said
he
was
ever
so
long
ago
she
wrote
them
i
believe
out
of
print
could
you
be
so
stupid
as
never
to
tell
me
before
said
marion
playfully
geoffrey
looked
pleased
not
much
of
a
novel
reader
he
said
tell
the
truth
not
sure
that
i
did
read
them
very
few
people
knew
anything
about
are
they
called
asked
marion
but
geoffrey
was
quite
at
fault
wrexham
as
usual
came
to
the
rescue
not
only
with
the
names
but
with
slight
but
appreciative
and
well
worded
sketches
of
the
two
novels
in
question
marion
was
delighted
and
still
more
so
when
their
ever
ready
guest
volunteered
to
procure
for
her
copies
of
the
books
though
now
as
geoffrey
had
said
out
of
print
shortly
after
wrexham
took
his
leave
geoffrey
undertook
to
put
him
on
his
road
as
he
expressed
his
intention
of
walking
home
marion
was
tired
and
went
to
bed
so
it
was
not
till
the
next
morning
at
breakfast
time
that
they
compared
notes
on
the
subject
of
their
guest
liked
him
better
when
you
came
to
talk
more
to
him
did
you
not
geoffrey
asked
marion
did
and
i
he
replied
have
still
that
queer
sort
of
feeling
of
not
making
him
out
but
it
may
be
my
fancy
only
i
daresay
straightforward
is
unusually
clever
and
said
marion
i
should
think
said
geoffrey
not
going
in
for
that
sort
of
thing
myself
i
can
admire
it
in
others
clever
oh
dear
yes
i
only
hope
not
too
you
talk
over
your
business
matters
satisfactorily
enquired
baldwin
i
think
so
replied
her
husband
he
said
seemed
right
enough
i
can
draw
out
your
money
of
course
any
day
my
own
too
in
part
the
man
can
have
no
motive
as
far
as
i
can
see
he
w
my
money
but
still
it
seems
asked
marion
i
forgot
i
told
you
wrexham
has
such
a
poor
opinion
of
the
investment
your
cousin
framley
vere
so
strongly
recommended
i
really
know
what
to
do
framley
vere
is
considered
a
very
good
man
of
business
and
he
you
know
is
your
other
trustee
in
fact
i
have
hardly
any
right
to
delay
doing
as
he
respect
to
your
money
and
i
mean
he
wrote
about
it
three
weeks
ago
and
wished
it
done
at
once
only
i
have
never
succeeded
in
getting
hold
of
wrexham
and
i
but
be
to
some
extent
impressed
by
what
he
said
if
i
wait
a
month
or
two
he
says
he
can
put
me
in
the
way
of
something
much
secure
to
say
but
i
like
seeming
to
oppose
framley
vere
indeed
no
right
to
do
so
if
he
were
at
home
i
would
go
and
see
him
but
on
the
might
write
to
him
suggested
marion
letters
are
sure
to
be
i
might
certainly
replied
her
husband
know
but
what
it
will
be
the
best
plan
i
will
write
and
tell
him
all
wrexham
told
me
it
was
in
confidence
but
that
of
course
does
not
exclude
my
i
can
ask
him
to
reply
at
once
yes
that
will
be
the
best
plan
thank
you
for
suggesting
it
you
see
i
hate
writing
so
the
last
expedient
that
ever
enters
my
and
with
considerable
relief
at
the
solution
of
his
perplexity
baldwin
left
the
two
days
later
marion
fell
ill
her
complaint
was
only
a
very
bad
cold
but
so
bad
that
for
a
fortnight
she
was
confined
to
her
room
geoffrey
was
unhappy
enough
about
her
though
he
said
little
marion
herself
was
comparatively
cheerful
the
enforced
rest
of
body
and
to
a
great
extent
of
mind
also
was
soothing
to
her
just
then
and
she
was
the
sort
of
woman
that
is
never
sweeter
and
more
loveable
than
in
illness
geoffrey
wrote
to
framley
vere
but
during
this
fortnight
there
came
no
answer
the
first
day
marion
was
downstairs
again
geoffrey
told
her
that
the
post
had
brought
a
letter
from
miss
temple
begging
him
possible
to
meet
her
the
following
day
at
a
point
on
her
journey
homewards
from
devonshire
as
her
escort
could
only
bring
her
thus
far
and
in
her
helpless
state
her
maid
was
not
sufficient
protection
the
young
man
hesitated
to
comply
as
he
disliked
the
idea
of
leaving
his
wife
alone
in
a
barely
convalescent
state
but
when
she
heard
or
it
marion
begged
him
to
do
as
veronica
asked
is
but
little
we
can
do
for
her
she
said
only
think
what
a
friend
she
has
been
to
us
me
replied
geoffrey
i
am
not
so
sure
that
you
have
the
same
reason
to
say
so
had
it
not
been
for
meeting
again
at
her
house
i
probability
is
poor
child
you
would
never
have
been
talked
out
of
your
first
decision
what
would
it
not
have
saved
you
said
his
wife
looking
up
with
eyes
full
or
tears
he
had
never
before
said
as
much
and
she
was
deeply
touched
unconsciously
his
few
words
revealed
to
her
the
rare
unselfishness
of
his
character
even
in
looking
back
to
what
truly
had
been
the
bitterest
trial
of
his
life
he
thought
of
the
past
if
not
solely
at
least
chiefly
from
her
point
of
view
would
it
not
have
saved
she
might
have
perhaps
said
more
but
a
entering
interrupted
them
geoffrey
was
obliged
to
leave
that
morning
in
order
to
reach
the
point
the
same
evening
so
as
to
be
ready
to
start
with
his
charge
the
following
day
at
an
early
enough
hour
to
reach
mallingford
before
dark
the
succeeding
afternoon
but
he
carried
with
him
on
his
journey
a
companion
which
cheered
and
encouraged
him
as
he
had
little
hoped
ever
again
to
be
cheered
and
encouraged
all
through
the
long
railway
journey
in
the
unfamiliar
bustling
town
where
he
spent
the
night
it
was
present
with
remembrance
of
a
sweet
pale
face
and
soft
eyes
dimmed
with
tears
gently
calling
him
by
name
in
a
voice
half
of
reproach
but
telling
surely
of
something
more
something
he
had
not
all
through
these
weary
months
ventured
to
hope
for
as
possible
for
him
even
in
the
furthest
future
could
it
be
or
was
he
mad
to
think
it
could
it
be
that
marion
his
wife
was
learning
to
care
for
him
the
thought
thrilled
him
through
and
through
it
gave
a
brightness
to
his
face
and
manner
that
poor
veronica
rejoiced
to
see
she
was
not
given
to
the
asking
of
intrusive
questions
or
of
beating
about
a
delicate
subject
in
hopes
of
discovering
its
exact
condition
both
which
modes
of
torture
some
people
seem
to
consider
a
proof
of
the
most
devoted
friendship
so
she
said
nothing
at
all
verging
on
the
matter
so
constantly
in
her
thoughts
but
the
tone
in
which
geoffrey
replied
to
her
affectionate
enquiries
about
his
wife
fell
pleasantly
on
her
ear
is
much
better
said
geoffrey
she
really
has
been
very
ill
i
bear
to
hear
her
coughs
though
the
doctor
assures
me
she
is
perfectly
sound
to
tell
you
the
truth
veronica
he
added
with
a
half
smile
am
such
a
baby
about
marion
i
half
like
leaving
her
even
for
a
was
very
good
of
you
dear
geoffrey
said
miss
temple
really
know
how
i
should
have
got
home
without
you
but
if
i
had
had
the
least
notion
she
was
ill
i
would
never
have
asked
was
not
the
slightest
reason
really
for
my
not
corning
said
geoffrey
you
see
ridiculously
anxious
about
her
but
she
would
never
have
forgiven
me
if
i
come
she
is
always
so
delighted
if
we
can
be
of
the
least
use
to
you
no
one
sure
deserves
as
much
of
are
very
dear
good
children
both
of
you
said
veronica
were
i
as
i
hope
to
be
before
i
die
perfectly
assured
that
i
have
throughout
acted
for
your
real
good
by
both
of
you
i
think
i
should
die
had
said
more
than
she
had
intended
a
moment
after
she
almost
regretted
having
done
so
for
though
geoffrey
pressed
her
hand
her
poor
wasted
hand
which
years
ago
in
girlhood
had
been
so
round
and
pretty
he
said
nothing
and
she
half
fancied
her
words
brought
a
red
flush
to
his
fair
face
their
journey
was
accomplished
in
safety
it
was
pretty
late
in
the
afternoon
when
their
train
puffed
into
mallingford
station
and
geoffrey
jumped
out
on
to
the
platform
to
see
that
the
easiest
of
the
carriages
was
in
waiting
according
to
command
for
the
invalid
lady
veronica
meantime
remained
with
her
maid
in
the
railway
carriage
awaiting
his
return
he
was
absent
barely
five
short
a
time
truly
to
change
a
man
from
youth
to
age
from
the
aspect
of
robust
health
to
that
of
pallid
haggard
had
five
months
nay
years
elapsed
before
geoffrey
baldwin
returned
to
veronica
she
would
have
been
amazed
and
horrified
at
the
change
his
bright
boyish
face
looked
like
that
of
a
man
of
fifty
all
drawn
and
pinched
pallid
as
with
a
pallor
of
death
blue
about
the
lips
even
the
sunny
hair
at
that
moment
seemed
to
be
dimmed
by
a
shade
of
grey
veronica
was
too
terrified
to
speak
the
one
word
she
shaped
with
her
lips
though
her
tongue
refused
to
utter
it
but
geoffrey
understood
her
he
whispered
hoarsely
that
but
the
old
bank
bank
has
stopped
payment
it
was
my
own
fault
i
have
ruined
her
curse
that
fellow
curse
him
he
muttered
fiercely
between
his
teeth
chapter
vii
a
friend
in
disguise
all
her
might
she
cloth
her
business
to
bringen
him
out
of
his
heaviness
lo
here
what
gentleness
these
women
have
if
we
could
know
it
for
our
rudéness
alway
right
sorry
for
our
distress
in
every
manner
thus
show
they
ruth
that
in
them
is
all
goodness
and
all
chaucer
an
exclamation
of
terror
from
maid
startled
geoffrey
and
made
him
look
round
for
in
his
madness
of
rage
and
misery
he
had
instinctively
turned
his
face
away
from
the
eyes
of
his
gentle
friend
the
poor
lady
lay
all
but
fainting
gasping
for
breath
in
a
way
piteous
to
behold
the
sight
to
some
extent
recalled
the
young
man
to
himself
in
a
few
moments
by
the
exercise
of
strong
veronica
overcame
the
hysterical
feeling
which
was
half
choking
her
and
allowed
baldwin
to
carry
her
to
the
fly
not
a
word
was
spoken
by
either
till
they
reached
miss
cottage
only
just
before
they
stopped
veronica
took
hand
and
gently
pressed
it
in
her
own
poor
boy
she
whispered
he
turned
his
head
away
though
there
was
no
one
in
the
carriage
but
themselves
he
could
not
bear
her
to
see
the
tears
which
her
sympathy
wrung
from
his
manhood
but
they
did
him
good
he
began
to
collect
his
startled
senses
and
to
consider
how
best
to
perform
the
terrible
duty
before
him
of
breaking
the
news
to
his
wife
when
they
alighted
at
miss
door
and
the
little
bustle
of
conveying
the
invalid
to
her
sofa
was
safely
accomplished
the
servant
handed
him
a
letter
the
address
was
in
handwriting
baldwin
said
the
girl
called
this
afternoon
and
had
inquired
at
what
time
miss
temple
was
expected
home
hearing
it
might
be
late
she
had
left
the
letter
and
asked
that
it
might
be
delivered
the
envelope
contained
a
few
words
from
marion
enclosing
a
letter
with
a
german
was
as
follows
geoffrey
enclosed
came
by
this
post
i
see
it
is
from
framley
vere
and
as
i
know
you
are
anxious
to
hear
from
him
i
am
going
to
take
it
in
to
mallingford
that
you
may
get
it
on
your
arrival
at
miss
i
am
so
much
better
that
the
doctor
told
me
i
should
take
a
drive
i
hope
you
have
got
on
prosperously
in
your
travels
and
that
you
will
bring
dear
veronica
safe
home
give
her
my
best
love
affectionate
wife
marion
even
at
that
moment
geoffrey
held
the
letter
tenderly
looked
lovingly
at
the
words
it
was
the
first
letter
he
had
ever
had
from
his
wife
but
it
added
a
sharper
pang
to
his
wretchedness
affectionate
wife
my
poor
child
what
have
i
ever
caused
you
but
misery
he
murmured
to
himself
he
opened
the
enclosure
these
were
its
contents
march
baldwin
letter
has
only
just
reached
me
i
have
been
moving
about
lately
so
much
i
write
in
great
haste
to
assure
you
that
all
you
have
been
told
against
the
and
is
utter
nonsense
there
is
no
safer
or
better
investment
in
the
united
kingdom
at
present
whoever
told
you
what
you
wrote
of
to
me
must
be
either
a
knave
himself
with
his
own
purposes
to
serve
or
the
dupe
of
such
a
one
and
if
an
honest
man
i
see
why
he
should
have
bound
you
over
not
to
give
his
name
as
your
authority
to
your
the
thing
does
not
look
well
within
the
last
day
or
two
i
have
heard
quite
accidentally
from
a
friend
in
your
county
certain
vague
reports
affecting
the
mallingford
bank
very
likely
they
have
not
reached
you
those
on
the
spot
or
most
interested
in
such
rumours
are
often
the
last
to
hear
them
and
they
may
very
probably
be
utterly
unfounded
still
all
inclines
me
to
lose
no
time
in
my
young
money
from
its
present
quarters
i
should
strongly
advise
you
also
to
look
to
your
own
property
in
the
bank
as
i
believe
it
is
of
considerable
amount
i
should
be
glad
to
hear
from
you
that
you
have
done
as
i
advise
with
regard
to
your
and
her
money
you
have
of
course
acted
for
the
best
still
the
delay
makes
me
a
little
uneasy
give
my
kind
regards
to
marion
i
hear
very
good
accounts
of
her
brother
hartford
from
an
officer
in
his
regiment
who
is
a
friend
of
mine
very
truly
geoffrey
handed
both
letters
to
veronica
she
read
them
carefully
before
she
spoke
he
watched
her
impatiently
as
soon
as
she
had
finished
he
said
in
a
dull
hopeless
shall
i
tell
her
and
harry
too
she
will
feel
his
share
of
it
even
more
veronica
considered
a
little
then
she
you
not
acting
prematurely
in
deciding
that
all
is
so
very
bad
as
you
imagine
after
all
it
was
a
mere
report
you
heard
at
the
station
something
must
be
wrong
doubtless
but
it
may
not
be
so
bad
as
you
think
would
it
not
be
well
in
the
first
place
to
go
to
the
bank
see
wrexham
and
hear
particulars
course
said
geoffrey
starting
up
and
seizing
his
hat
a
fool
i
was
not
to
think
of
that
before
but
i
really
was
stunned
for
the
must
have
a
cup
of
tea
or
a
glass
of
wine
before
you
go
suggested
veronica
will
frighten
everybody
you
meet
with
that
pale
face
of
yours
now
be
a
good
boy
five
minutes
will
make
no
the
young
man
was
chafing
at
the
delay
marion
he
suddenly
exclaimed
will
be
expecting
me
at
here
till
the
morning
replied
miss
temple
will
give
us
time
to
talk
over
matters
after
you
have
learnt
the
exact
state
of
things
i
will
send
a
note
to
marion
while
you
are
out
saying
that
i
have
kept
you
as
you
were
tired
with
your
two
journey
and
asking
her
to
send
the
carriage
for
you
in
the
morning
i
can
get
the
gardener
to
take
the
note
he
can
borrow
you
said
geoffrey
will
do
very
and
thankful
for
the
temporary
reprieve
he
set
off
on
his
errand
of
enquiry
in
about
an
time
he
returned
veronica
was
anxiously
waiting
for
him
he
entered
the
room
slowly
and
threw
himself
on
the
sofa
hiding
his
face
in
its
cushions
have
you
heard
asked
miss
temple
at
last
though
his
manner
had
already
prepare
her
for
his
answer
it
came
after
interval
in
a
dull
dead
tone
very
worst
he
replied
she
asked
gently
it
was
better
to
rouse
him
to
force
him
to
face
it
and
as
speedily
as
possible
to
make
up
his
mind
to
what
must
be
done
next
he
shivered
slightly
then
made
an
impatient
gesture
as
if
he
would
fain
push
aside
her
enquiries
and
her
sympathy
but
she
persisted
bravely
has
it
all
been
she
asked
did
you
see
old
clerk
lee
he
replied
is
all
his
savings
gone
and
the
disgrace
which
i
verily
believe
he
feels
more
as
i
should
if
i
were
alone
good
god
why
did
i
bind
that
poor
fate
to
mine
to
think
of
it
all
poor
have
come
to
this
it
is
an
utter
complete
smash
a
perfectly
hopeless
ruin
some
little
trifle
of
and
money
i
may
possibly
recover
eventually
but
mine
is
all
for
ever
you
see
i
was
still
legally
a
how
has
it
been
caused
veronica
enquired
again
may
well
ask
he
answered
bitterly
that
is
the
hideous
part
of
it
to
think
that
it
has
all
been
the
work
of
that
oily
devil
and
that
he
has
taken
himself
off
in
time
to
escape
the
punishment
he
deserves
what
i
should
have
given
him
if
the
law
cursed
scamp
that
he
is
geoffrey
pleaded
veronica
am
not
blaming
you
my
poor
boy
but
when
you
speak
so
violently
you
startle
me
and
make
me
so
nervous
i
can
not
think
quietly
as
i
should
wish
of
what
is
to
be
done
wrexham
i
suppose
you
are
talking
of
said
geoffrey
name
him
it
is
all
his
doing
his
wealth
was
all
moonshine
he
has
been
left
far
too
much
to
himself
lee
says
the
other
partner
having
perfect
confidence
in
him
he
has
been
speculating
in
the
most
reckless
way
it
now
appears
and
foreseeing
the
inevitable
crash
has
laid
his
plans
accordingly
and
taken
himself
off
in
time
it
is
suspected
he
has
taken
in
some
form
or
diamonds
perhaps
like
the
fellow
in
that
book
marion
was
fellow
who
himself
or
was
somebody
else
i
make
it
out
comfortable
provision
for
when
was
all
this
discovered
he
be
traced
asked
veronica
breathlessly
had
been
away
four
days
before
anything
wrong
was
suspected
replied
geoffrey
run
it
too
fine
you
see
he
was
to
have
returned
three
days
ago
with
lots
of
money
when
he
come
and
sent
no
letter
they
began
to
get
frightened
linthwaite
the
other
partner
then
thought
it
would
be
as
well
to
look
into
things
a
little
and
a
nice
mess
they
found
they
did
what
they
could
then
of
course
sent
off
for
detectives
and
all
the
rest
of
it
by
way
of
shutting
the
empty
but
useless
had
too
clear
a
start
and
even
if
they
got
him
they
would
get
nothing
out
of
him
prepared
for
that
lee
says
if
he
has
made
off
with
property
in
any
form
it
will
be
too
well
hidden
for
us
to
get
at
it
my
case
is
the
worst
for
wife
has
money
settled
on
herself
elsewhere
invested
and
no
one
had
property
in
the
bank
to
anything
like
my
amount
they
kept
the
doors
open
for
a
day
or
two
and
paid
out
the
little
they
had
for
one
or
two
of
the
farmers
in
the
neighbourhood
happened
to
draw
rather
heavily
on
tuesday
but
yesterday
evening
they
lost
all
hope
of
the
turning
up
and
even
go
through
the
farce
this
morning
of
taking
down
the
if
old
lee
has
suspected
that
things
were
wrong
why
in
name
did
he
not
warn
you
asked
veronica
suspect
anything
replied
baldwin
disliked
wrexham
personally
but
he
could
have
given
no
reason
for
doing
so
besides
unless
he
had
had
something
definite
to
tell
you
expect
the
poor
fellow
to
have
risked
losing
his
daily
bread
by
talking
against
his
employers
ten
to
one
had
he
come
to
me
i
would
have
thought
him
mad
no
that
blackguard
has
deceived
every
for
some
minutes
they
sat
still
geoffrey
moodily
staring
into
the
fire
then
he
repeated
his
old
question
am
i
to
tell
marion
veronica
i
do
so
for
you
she
said
wish
to
heaven
you
would
he
ejaculated
would
be
the
greatest
proof
of
friendship
you
have
ever
shewn
me
which
is
saying
a
good
will
do
it
if
you
so
much
wish
it
she
replied
i
do
not
feel
sure
it
is
right
for
anyone
to
break
it
to
her
but
husband
i
think
too
you
misjudge
her
in
thinking
this
sort
of
bad
news
is
likely
to
shock
and
prostrate
her
as
you
seem
to
imagine
it
will
your
wife
is
no
fool
geoffrey
she
is
a
woman
and
will
find
strength
to
suffer
and
work
for
those
she
yes
he
replied
with
a
groan
all
been
different
in
other
respects
she
would
not
have
been
found
wanting
but
you
know
all
veronica
you
never
can
it
was
the
only
thing
i
could
give
home
and
all
that
money
could
buy
and
now
my
darling
will
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
be
brought
through
me
face
to
face
with
poverty
it
is
too
miss
temple
said
nothing
but
she
had
her
own
thoughts
nevertheless
they
decided
that
the
following
day
when
geoffrey
returned
home
he
should
tell
his
wife
that
miss
veronica
was
anxious
to
see
her
and
should
arrange
for
her
driving
over
as
soon
as
possible
to
her
cottage
but
in
this
they
to
some
extent
reckoned
without
their
host
the
carriage
which
came
the
next
morning
to
fetch
miss
guest
home
to
the
manor
farm
brought
in
it
early
though
it
was
baldwin
herself
eager
to
welcome
the
travellers
in
person
geoffrey
was
already
out
off
again
to
the
scene
of
his
troubles
the
mallingford
bank
there
to
meet
linthwaite
and
go
over
with
him
all
the
details
of
the
miserable
story
but
he
was
to
be
back
in
heart
failed
her
when
she
heard
her
young
step
on
the
stair
it
was
no
light
or
pleasant
task
which
in
her
unselfishness
she
had
undertaken
suddenly
it
occurred
to
her
not
marion
have
already
heard
the
bad
news
and
this
be
the
reason
of
her
early
visit
how
stupid
not
to
have
thought
of
this
before
she
almost
hoped
it
might
be
so
but
a
glance
at
face
decided
her
that
no
bird
of
evil
omen
in
the
shape
a
miss
tremlett
or
any
of
her
gossiping
cronies
had
yet
carried
the
tidings
to
the
young
mistress
of
the
manor
farm
for
marion
though
somewhat
pale
from
her
recent
illness
looked
bright
and
cheerful
happier
by
far
than
when
last
her
friend
had
seen
her
which
did
not
make
things
easier
for
poor
veronica
the
girl
kissed
her
affectionately
and
said
something
in
her
own
sweet
way
as
far
as
possible
removed
from
the
coldness
of
which
by
mere
acquaintances
she
was
usually
accused
of
her
pleasure
at
her
safe
return
to
them
then
some
little
details
of
the
journey
were
mentioned
and
veronica
remarked
casually
that
geoffrey
had
gone
to
the
bank
for
on
business
but
would
be
back
shortly
as
he
was
expecting
the
carriage
to
meet
him
he
did
not
know
you
would
be
in
it
dear
marion
said
veronica
was
very
good
of
you
to
come
so
soon
i
was
just
writing
a
note
to
ask
you
to
come
this
afternoon
i
wanted
particularly
to
see
then
there
fell
a
little
silence
and
out
of
the
heart
of
the
elder
woman
there
crept
to
that
of
her
friend
a
soft
mysterious
message
of
sympathy
words
were
not
wanted
a
slight
shiver
ran
through
marion
and
she
turned
to
veronica
is
wrong
what
is
it
you
are
wishing
to
tell
me
and
can
not
find
strength
to
utter
dear
veronica
do
not
fear
for
and
miss
temple
laid
her
hand
gently
on
and
the
brave
clear
eyes
fixed
on
her
drew
forth
the
bare
unsoftened
truth
child
your
husband
is
ruined
the
mallingford
bank
in
which
was
all
he
possessed
has
failed
and
he
is
utterly
she
had
not
meant
to
tell
it
so
shortly
and
suddenly
she
had
thought
of
by
degrees
as
even
the
wisest
and
tenderest
of
us
persist
in
doing
to
others
however
we
may
suffer
when
the
operation
is
performed
on
ourselves
but
with
eyes
thus
fixed
on
her
she
had
no
option
but
to
tell
the
whole
sharply
to
her
own
ears
indeed
cruelly
in
its
accuracy
and
stern
reality
eyes
never
flinched
she
said
quietly
my
with
the
last
word
her
face
worked
a
little
and
for
a
moment
veronica
fancied
a
dimness
overspread
the
grey
eyes
still
resolutely
fixed
on
hers
but
she
too
answered
calmly
and
deliberately
and
your
brother
rank
as
creditors
eventually
therefore
some
small
portion
of
your
property
may
be
recovered
once
the
affairs
of
the
bank
are
finally
wound
up
this
however
will
probably
not
be
known
for
some
months
and
in
any
case
it
will
not
be
much
settlements
on
you
at
the
time
of
your
marriage
i
never
thought
of
i
wonder
if
they
will
be
considered
your
property
i
am
not
enough
acquainted
with
such
matters
to
say
but
in
any
case
my
dearest
marion
i
fear
very
very
little
will
be
recovered
it
is
so
dreadful
i
understand
how
i
am
able
to
talk
about
it
so
marion
did
not
speak
for
a
few
moments
then
she
said
many
others
suffered
in
the
same
the
same
extent
veronica
looked
rather
tell
you
the
truth
she
said
did
not
ask
i
was
so
absorbed
in
your
part
of
it
but
no
one
i
am
sure
can
have
suffered
to
the
same
extent
for
linthwaite
had
not
nearly
so
much
money
in
the
bank
and
his
wife
is
rich
besides
doubtless
many
of
the
farmers
in
the
neighbourhood
will
have
lost
what
to
them
will
be
as
much
as
is
to
him
it
is
all
owing
to
his
having
unfortunately
kept
his
whole
property
there
these
last
few
months
a
thing
he
never
contemplated
save
as
a
temporary
convenience
of
wrexham
asked
marion
wrexham
repeated
veronica
you
not
know
it
was
all
his
doing
that
he
has
absconded
but
of
course
could
you
and
then
she
related
to
marion
the
details
she
had
gathered
from
geoffrey
of
the
reputed
little
suspected
rascality
baldwin
heard
her
in
silence
but
when
all
had
been
told
she
exclaimed
passionately
veronica
the
whole
is
my
doing
instinct
was
truer
than
mine
he
distrusted
that
man
from
the
first
and
i
talked
him
out
of
it
i
thought
him
clever
and
i
see
now
how
he
was
flattering
me
up
what
a
fool
i
was
oh
veronica
those
two
or
three
weeks
might
have
saved
poor
geoffrey
this
ruin
it
will
break
his
heart
i
know
and
it
is
all
my
marion
said
her
friend
will
make
it
no
easier
to
geoffrey
for
you
to
blame
yourself
so
exaggeratedly
and
it
is
very
unlikely
that
the
two
or
three
delay
has
made
matters
worse
withdrawing
any
large
sums
when
he
first
intended
doing
so
would
only
have
accelerated
the
discovery
without
probably
saving
but
marion
had
got
it
into
her
head
that
she
alone
was
to
blame
for
the
overwhelming
catastrophe
and
refused
to
listen
to
attempted
consolation
it
was
the
worst
bit
of
the
whole
to
her
the
reflection
that
it
was
her
doing
what
a
curse
she
had
been
to
this
man
she
thought
to
herself
saddening
his
whole
life
as
she
had
done
remorseful
when
as
she
much
feared
in
her
present
mood
it
was
too
late
and
now
to
crown
all
the
cause
of
his
finding
himself
a
pauper
he
who
till
now
had
known
nothing
of
battling
with
the
world
struggling
amidst
the
toilworn
human
beings
for
the
means
of
existence
in
a
very
blackness
of
misery
marion
baldwin
sat
in
silence
while
she
thus
accused
herself
veronica
was
grievously
distressed
at
last
she
hit
on
a
new
argument
she
said
will
be
returning
directly
the
bitterest
part
of
this
to
him
i
need
not
tell
you
is
the
thought
of
what
it
will
be
to
you
it
is
for
you
only
he
dreads
so
fearfully
the
trials
before
you
both
i
have
been
trying
to
comfort
and
strengthen
him
by
telling
him
he
was
exaggerating
what
it
would
be
to
you
you
are
brave
and
strong
my
and
stronger
than
you
perhaps
think
yourself
i
know
it
is
not
this
misfortune
in
itself
which
is
so
crushing
you
it
is
this
morbid
notion
that
you
have
had
a
hand
in
bringing
it
on
but
even
supposing
it
were
so
heaven
knows
you
advised
geoffrey
as
you
thought
for
the
best
it
is
unworthy
of
you
to
make
yourself
miserable
by
this
judging
by
results
and
if
geoffrey
finds
you
thus
how
will
he
poor
fellow
be
able
to
stand
it
all
think
me
harsh
my
poor
child
for
speaking
so
at
such
a
time
you
will
thank
me
afterwards
for
urging
you
to
show
yourself
a
true
wife
by
forgetting
everything
but
your
suffering
and
strengthening
him
to
bear
marion
looked
up
with
a
new
light
in
her
face
a
glance
of
mingled
strength
and
tenderness
in
her
eyes
a
door
was
heard
to
open
a
step
slowly
and
heavily
sounded
along
the
passage
she
had
only
time
to
whisper
shall
not
be
disappointed
in
me
veronica
when
the
door
opened
and
geoffrey
entered
he
had
not
expected
to
see
his
wife
and
when
he
caught
sight
of
her
his
face
flushed
suddenly
and
without
attempting
to
greet
her
he
sank
down
on
the
nearest
chair
burying
his
head
in
his
hands
veronica
glanced
imploringly
at
marion
but
her
appeal
was
not
needed
without
a
word
the
young
wife
rose
from
her
chair
and
crossed
the
room
quickly
to
where
her
husband
was
sitting
he
did
not
see
her
his
face
was
hidden
but
he
heard
the
rustle
of
her
dress
as
she
approached
him
he
knew
it
could
not
be
the
cripple
veronica
the
step
came
quick
and
firm
a
notion
flashed
into
his
mind
that
his
wife
was
leaving
the
room
because
he
had
entered
it
hastening
from
the
presence
of
the
man
who
had
at
last
by
his
insane
folly
put
the
finishing
stroke
to
all
the
misery
he
had
brought
on
her
fair
young
life
he
would
not
look
up
instinctively
he
kept
his
face
hidden
preferring
to
await
blindly
what
he
felt
to
be
a
crisis
in
his
life
less
than
a
moment
passed
while
marion
crossed
the
room
but
time
enough
for
a
whole
army
of
hopes
and
fears
doubts
and
misgivings
to
chase
each
other
across
poor
brain
he
felt
weak
and
giddy
for
he
had
gone
through
much
and
eaten
little
in
the
last
few
hours
and
a
quiver
ran
all
through
him
when
a
hand
was
gently
laid
on
his
shoulder
and
a
voice
sweeter
to
him
than
the
loveliest
music
called
him
by
name
it
said
poor
geoffrey
my
dear
husband
look
up
and
show
that
you
trust
me
it
is
to
the
full
as
much
my
fault
as
yours
that
this
misfortune
has
come
upon
us
but
why
should
either
of
us
blame
the
other
it
is
not
the
worst
sorrow
that
could
have
happened
to
us
we
are
young
and
strong
and
we
will
meet
it
together
bravely
only
not
turn
from
me
do
not
punish
me
for
all
my
selfish
my
wicked
scorn
long
ago
of
your
goodness
and
not
punish
me
by
repulsing
me
now
now
geoffrey
in
your
time
of
sorrow
when
i
brave
all
and
remind
you
that
i
am
your
her
voice
broke
and
faltered
the
last
few
words
were
all
but
inaudible
but
they
reached
with
perfect
clearness
and
distinctness
the
ears
of
the
man
to
whom
they
were
addressed
they
fell
on
his
sore
heart
like
drops
of
refreshing
invigorating
rain
on
withered
leaves
he
lifted
his
head
he
stretched
out
his
arms
and
drew
her
to
him
in
a
long
close
embrace
and
there
were
more
tears
on
face
than
those
which
had
come
from
her
own
eyes
neither
spoke
and
there
was
for
a
moment
perfect
silence
in
the
room
then
it
was
broken
suddenly
by
a
queer
irregular
stumping
sound
which
passed
across
the
floor
and
out
at
the
door
almost
before
it
was
observed
by
the
two
so
absorbed
by
their
own
emotion
it
was
crutch
never
before
or
since
was
she
known
to
get
out
of
a
room
so
quickly
and
she
did
it
at
no
little
risk
to
herself
but
she
felt
that
the
moment
was
a
sacred
of
those
in
which
a
third
presence
even
though
that
of
the
most
devoted
friend
may
jar
on
the
sensitiveness
of
the
excited
nerves
may
unwittingly
interfere
with
the
perfect
healing
of
the
disunited
members
the
sealing
of
the
tacit
bond
of
reconciliation
an
hour
or
two
later
when
the
invalid
bade
adieu
to
her
friends
and
from
her
window
watched
them
drive
away
to
the
home
soon
to
be
theirs
no
longer
some
words
escaped
her
little
after
all
we
know
of
ourselves
or
each
other
or
what
is
best
for
any
of
us
after
all
who
can
say
but
what
my
two
poor
friends
may
have
reason
to
remember
with
thankfulness
the
failure
of
the
mallingford
bank
poverty
and
outward
suffering
and
struggling
may
bring
them
more
happiness
than
they
have
yet
found
since
they
joined
their
lives
together
god
grant
it
may
prove
so

of
in
your

again
three
years
only
since
the
dull
september
day
when
we
first
saw
marion
vere
in
her
house
in
the
london
square
three
years
ago
which
have
brought
more
than
one
change
to
her

have
more
than
once
utterly
altered
the
current
of
her
life
the
last
change
which
has
come
over
her

to
superficial
observation
seem
the
most
disastrous
of
all
let
us
see
if
in
truth
it
is
so
a
dull
uninteresting
suburban
street
secluded
and
too
much
so
for
even
the
enlivening
neighbourhood
of
shops
to
be
permitted
in
that
portion
of
it
where
our
interest
lies
rows
and
rows
of
monotonous
little
dwellings
all
of
the
regulation
rooms
on
one
side
of
the
strip
of
lobby
undeserving
of
the
more
important
name

thereof
a
flight
of
some
twelve
or
fifteen
steps
leading
to
the
room
above

kitchen

again
to
the
two
or
three
rooms
occupying
the
position
in
town
houses

usually
devoted
to

how
wearied
one
becomes
of
this

everlasting
pattern
of

how
sick

fortunately
or
unfortunately
the
dwellers
in
these

regulation
abodes
have
seldom
much
leisure
even
had
they
the
inclination
for
pondering
on
such
matters

offspring
of

constituting

has
a
wonderful
tendency
to
feather
a
nest
of
his
own
to
assemble
his
poor
little
household
the
six
teaspoons
left
to
mary
ann
by
her
to
his
own
gaudy
but
somewhat
faded
a
retreat
where
they
shall
be
sacred
from
the
inquisitive
eyes
and
prying
hands
of
landladies
where
he
can
smoke
his
pipe
of
an
evening
and
young
john
nurse
her
babies
undisturbed
by
fears
of
complaints
from
the
of
horrible
smell
of
tobacco
or
incessantly
screaming
but
even
the
luxury
of
the
smallest
of
houses
of
their
own
was
as
yet
beyond
the
means
of
and
baldwin
and
geoffrey
was
fain
to
be
content
with
three
tiny
rooms
and
a
landlady
when
preceding
his
wife
by
a
few
days
to
their
new
home
it
fell
to
his
share
to
do
what
he
could
in
the
way
of
preparing
for
her
reception
for
the
smash
at
mallingford
had
been
a
very
thorough
one
nothing
as
yet
had
been
retrieved
from
the
ruins
months
hence
some
trifling
dividend
might
be
forthcoming
but
as
their
share
of
this
would
be
altogether
insufficient
to
provide
for
their
daily
wants
geoffrey
had
declined
invitation
to
take
up
their
abode
with
her
till
the
exact
amount
should
be
known
and
had
manfully
set
his
shoulder
to
the
wheel
by
accepting
the
first
chance
of
employment
that
came
in
his
way
it
was
not
of
a
kind
congenial
to
his
tastes
or
education
a
clerkship
of
a
hundred
a
year
in
a
millington
does
not
sound
paradisaical
to
most
ears
least
of
all
to
those
of
a
man
of
thirty
whose
nightmare
from
earliest
youth
had
been
anything
in
the
shape
of
office
or
desk
or
but
as
said
the
old
friend
of
his
to
whom
he
was
indebted
for
the
introduction
it
was
better
than
losing
time
and
would
do
him
no
harm
should
some
more
desirable
opening
occur
hereafter
had
he
been
alone
in
the
world
when
he
thus
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
found
himself
face
to
face
with
poverty
geoffrey
baldwin
there
is
no
doubt
would
have
emigrated
he
was
just
the
man
of
which
the
right
stuff
is
made
and
the
life
would
have
suited
him
in
every
sense
but
to
his
joy
and
his
sorrow
he
was
not
alone
in
the
world
and
the
being
to
whom
every
drop
of
his
honest
blood
was
devoted
shrank
with
a
not
unusual
or
unnatural
shrinking
from
the
unknown
horrors
of
life
in
an
australian
or
the
pathless
forests
of
canada
even
millington
smoky
and
crowded
with
its
vulgar
rich
and
poor
seemed
to
her
imagination
to
offer
a
far
less
terrible
prospect
after
all
geoffrey
it
is
still
england
and
sooner
or
later
something
else
may
turn
up
in
two
or
three
years
harry
may
be
coming
home
and
think
how
terrible
it
would
be
for
him
if
we
were
away
at
the
other
side
of
the
world
said
the
poor
girl
so
the
subject
of
emigration
was
not
again
mooted
and
the
millington
offer
accepted
some
ready
money
was
realized
by
the
sale
of
the
manor
farm
furniture
and
horses
but
not
very
much
for
when
chairs
and
tables
that
have
looked
very
respectable
in
their
own
corners
for
forty
or
fifty
years
are
dragged
to
the
sound
of
an
hammer
into
the
relentless
glare
of
day
and
bargain
eyes
they
to
put
it
mildly
do
not
show
to
the
best
advantage
and
as
to
horses
they
are
not
famous
for
being
high
in
the
market
when
one
appears
therein
in
the
position
of
a
seller
it
was
too
the
end
of
the
hunting
season
when
the
smash
came
and
baldwin
was
not
in
the
habit
of
allowing
his
steeds
to
eat
their
heads
off
so
the
lot
of
them
were
not
in
the
showy
condition
conducive
to
the
fetching
of
long
sums
squire
copley
who
during
the
last
few
melancholy
weeks
of
the
young
stay
in
their
own
house
was
suffering
from
a
curiously
spasmodic
form
of
cold
in
the
head
which
attacked
him
most
inopportunely
on
several
occasions
when
he
happened
to
to
the
farm
and
necessitated
a
distressingly
lavish
recourse
to
his
took
a
violent
fancy
to
the
now
docile
coquette
her
of
course
under
the
circumstances
dirt
cheap
sir
dirt
cheap
i
assure
you
he
told
his
neighbours
when
the
details
of
sale
were
discussed
the
walnuts
and
the
the
exact
sum
he
was
never
known
to
mention
nor
did
it
ever
reach
ears
for
possibly
every
one
might
not
have
agreed
with
him
in
thinking
two
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
so
very
unparalleled

bargain
it
went
a
good
way
to
swelling
the
few
hundreds
of
ready
money
with
which
in
safe
keeping
against
the
possible
coming
of
a
still
rainier
day
geoffrey
baldwin
after
settling
down
to
the
smallest
every
claim
upon
him
or
his
household
set
out
for
the
first
time
to
do
battle
with
the
world
to
win
for
himself
and
that
other
so
infinitely
dearer
the
so
carelessly
demanded
so
thanklessly
received
by
those
who
have
never
known
what
it
is
to
eat
thereof
the
sweat
of
the
but
we
have
wandered
too
long
from
the
little
house
in
the
suburban
street
in
the
small
looking
out
to
the
front
sits
marion
the
same
marion
only
i
almost
think
altered
for
the
better
she
looks
stronger
and
to
use
a
homely
but
most
expressive
word
than
when
we
last
saw
her
surely
there
is
more
light
and
brightness
over
the
clear
pale
features
and
lurking
in
the
depths
of
the
grey
eyes
one
could
almost
fancy
there
was
something
of
gladness
if
not
of
mirth
or
is
it
only
the
flickering
dancing
light
reflected
on
her
face
of
the
bright
little
fire
the
evening
was
baldwin
after
some
scruples
on
the
score
of
economy
caused
to
be
lit
to
greet
her
return
we
shall
see
she
sits
there
in
the
gazing
into
the
red
glowing
depths
but
with
the
pleasant
shadow
of
a
smile
on
her
face
she
has
been
working
hard
enough
in
various
ways
to
enjoy
the
holiday
which
she
feels
she
has
earned
a
sensation
worth
trying
for
once
in
a
way
oh
ladies
with
the
soft
white
hands
guiltless
of
aught
but
useless
beauty
with
the
little
feet
to
whom
a
few
miles
of
tramp
through
muddy
streets
over
bard
unyielding
pavement
is
unknown
or
worse
still
with
brains
unconscious
of
any
object
in
their
own
existence
beyond
the
solution
of
some
millinery
problem
or
the
recollection
of
the
calls
falling
due
on
their
visiting
list
hard
work
indeed
i
have
been
told
more
than
once
by
those
who
should
be
qualified
to
judge
very
poor
pay
i
should
certainly
reply
though
the
hardness
of
the
work
may
be
a
matter
of
opinion
a
ring
at
the
bell
a
step
along
the
passage
a
somewhat
fagged
looking
face
at
the
door
which
marion
sprang
up
to
open
with
bright
welcome
on
her
own
very
muddy
marion
said
the
rather
tired
too
better
run
up
at
once
and
change
my
boots
i
shall
be
awfully
glad
of
a
cup
of
the
voice
evidently
wished
to
be
cheerful
but
could
not
quite
manage
it
poor
geoffrey
truly
millington
ways
and
millington
smoke
did
not
suit
you
but
there
was
genuine
unforced
gladness
in
the
tones
which
replied
to
him
quick
then
as
quick
as
you
can
i
have
just
infused
the
tea
and
i
have
lots
of
things
to
tell
you
i
have
been
so
busy
all
day
and
as
the
wearied
man
slowly
ascended
the
narrow
staircase
some
murmured
words
by
his
wife
escaped
him
darling
my
darling
for
myself
i
would
bear
it
all
fifty
times
over
to
know
your
goodness
as
i
a
short
toilette
sufficed
for
the
simple
meal
prepared
for
baldwin
in
the
little
parlour
which
served
him
and
his
wife
for
and
in
one
and
in
ten
time
he
rejoined
her
the
room
looked
wonderfully
comfortable
and
he
owned
to
himself
and
for
the
time
being
he
determined
to
forget
the
worries
and
annoyances
of
the
day
and
respond
as
far
as
he
could
to
the
unfailing
cheerfulness
of
his
wife
me
what
you
have
been
about
marion
he
said
look
even
brighter
than
usual
which
is
saying
a
good
deal
and
that
red
ribbon
round
your
neck
and
tying
up
your
hair
is
very
pretty
he
added
looking
at
her
approvingly
am
glad
you
like
it
she
replied
laughing
in
the
first
place
it
a
ribbon
such
a
thing
as
velvet
ribbon
there
he
asked
gravely
sure
i
have
heard
of
velvet
you
mean
you
stupid
geoffrey
she
answered
am
really
afraid
never
do
for
millington
not
the
least
of
a
geoffrey
laughed
had
better
take
care
what
you
say
marion
imagine
the
horror
of
old
baxter
if
he
heard
you
talking
of
his
palatial
warehouse
as
a
shop
so
it
is
only
a
very
big
one
persisted
the
incorrigible
baldwin
you
be
afraid
of
my
hurting
the
feelings
of
old
baxter
as
you
call
him
or
old
anybody
else
not
that
likely
ever
to
hear
me
speak
either
of
him
or
his
shop
these
millington
people
are
far
too
grand
ever
to
take
any
notice
of
know
that
said
her
husband
reminds
me
a
piece
of
news
for
you
too
but
i
want
to
hear
yours
first
tell
me
what
been
doing
all
afternoon
i
have
been
busy
at
home
like
a
good
wife
darning
your
stockings
or
socks
as
appleby
calls
them
really
and
truly
geoffrey
i
have
darned
four
is
to
say
three
pair
and
a
half
for
in
the
eighth
sock
to
my
unspeakable
delight
there
was
no
hole
i
poked
m
y
hand
all
round
inside
it
but
not
one
of
my
fingers
came
through
there
even
any
thin
places
which
wanted
strengthening
if
you
know
what
that
is
you
have
no
idea
of
the
excitement
of
looking
for
holes
it
is
almost
more
fascinating
than
pulling
to
see
if
they
are
loose
i
have
to
force
myself
to
be
dreadfully
conscientious
about
it
sometimes
i
feel
so
tempted
only
to
give
a
very
gentle
tug
which
pull
even
a
very
loose
one
off
millington
must
be
a
ruinous
place
for
poor
people
you
have
no
notion
how
quickly
you
wear
out
your
i
certainly
as
my
good
fairy
takes
care
i
never
find
any
holes
in
them
he
answered
tenderly
never
mind
stockings
he
went
on
me
what
you
did
this
morning
she
replied
this
morning
i
went
a
tremendously
long
yourself
with
sharp
you
know
i
told
you
that
nice
little
sharp
had
called
here
last
week
the
wife
of
the
curate
at
her
husband
was
a
pupil
at
the
years
ago
and
that
seemed
a
sort
of
introduction
she
is
really
very
nice
she
knew
something
about
the
bank
breaking
i
mean
and
why
we
came
here
i
told
her
the
first
time
i
saw
her
how
anxious
i
was
to
do
something
to
help
you
be
angry
came
to
tell
me
she
had
heard
of
two
pupils
for
exclaimed
her
husband
she
crept
down
to
the
floor
beside
him
and
hid
her
face
on
his
arm
as
she
went
on
seems
so
very
nice
geoffrey
listen
and
say
anything
till
you
hear
all
about
it
sharp
took
me
to
see
the
two
little
boys
i
am
to
teach
they
are
very
little
boys
the
eldest
only
ten
they
generally
go
to
school
but
scarlet
fever
broke
out
there
a
month
ago
and
they
are
not
to
return
till
christmas
it
is
only
till
then
i
am
to
teach
them
and
it
is
only
to
be
three
mornings
in
the
week
just
to
keep
them
in
the
way
of
lessons
a
little
their
mother
said
she
is
rather
nice
fat
and
guiltless
of
she
was
very
kind
and
pleasant
about
as
she
called
it
five
guineas
a
month
i
think
very
good
you
but
geoffrey
was
incapable
of
replying
in
the
same
light
cheerful
tone
he
stooped
down
and
passed
his
arm
round
waist
thus
drawing
her
nearer
to
him
then
he
said
in
a
choked
husky
voice
my
dearest
you
are
an
angel
stand
being
an
angel
she
answered
lightly
you
had
much
experience
of
me
in
such
a
seriously
geoffrey
do
say
i
may
do
this
i
really
enough
to
do
all
the
hours
you
are
away
darning
stockings
even
palls
on
one
after
a
few
hours
and
it
will
make
me
so
happy
to
feel
i
am
earning
a
little
money
dear
geoffrey
say
i
and
with
a
pretty
air
of
appeal
she
drew
his
face
round
so
that
she
could
see
the
expression
in
his
eyes
is
only
till
christmas
you
say
he
enquired
doubtfully
till
christmas
she
repeated
the
distance
he
objected
said
it
was
a
long
walk
how
are
you
to
go
there
and
back
three
times
a
week
fine
weather
walk
she
replied
unhesitatingly
am
a
capital
walker
and
you
see
yourself
i
am
not
the
least
tired
and
on
wet
days
you
can
put
me
in
the
omnibus
as
you
go
to
business
in
the
morning
it
passes
the
corner
of
this
street
and
sharp
says
it
is
never
crowded
at
the
hours
i
should
be
coming
and
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
for
geoffrey
to
give
in
as
indeed
from
the
first
he
had
instinctively
feared
would
be
the
case
though
the
plan
went
sorely
against
his
inclination
he
yet
had
a
idea
that
possibly
it
was
really
kinder
and
more
unselfish
to
yield
to
his
the
additional
interest
and
occupation
might
be
of
actual
benefit
to
her
and
help
her
to
get
through
the
lonely
dreary
millington
winter
he
so
dreaded
for
her
in
anticipation
said
too
you
had
something
to
tell
me
you
geoffrey
asked
marion
after
a
short
silence
and
with
perhaps
something
of
the
womanly
instinct
of
changing
the
conversation
before
the
scarcely
attained
concession
could
be
withdrawn
i
he
answered
absently
yes
i
remember
it
was
when
we
were
talking
of
the
baxters
and
you
said
they
were
far
too
grand
to
notice
us
baxter
told
me
that
his
wife
shortly
to
have
the
pleasure
of
calling
on
what
do
you
think
of
that
am
rather
vexed
she
replied
speaking
slowly
and
deliberately
have
been
very
happy
here
by
ourselves
without
anybody
noticing
us
and
i
would
rather
go
on
the
same
way
i
am
not
silly
or
prejudiced
geoffrey
i
like
nice
people
whoever
they
are
but
i
can
not
help
shrinking
a
little
from
these
terribly
rich
millington
people
i
am
afraid
i
am
just
a
little
bad
in
one
way
i
endure
being
geoffrey
looked
pained
know
i
know
he
said
hastily
is
horrible
for
you
perfectly
unbearable
you
think
i
know
it
and
feel
it
heaven
knows
how
bitterly
i
was
more
than
half
inclined
to
tell
the
old
fellow
his
wife
might
keep
her
precious
visits
to
herself
only
i
dared
not
risk
offending
him
condescension
indeed
vulgar
wretches
if
we
wanted
them
to
come
prying
about
us
the
marion
jumped
up
and
put
her
hand
on
his
mouth
geoffrey
it
is
very
wicked
of
me
to
put
such
notions
into
your
head
i
had
no
business
to
talk
about
hating
being
patronised
it
is
very
silly
and
low
and
mean
of
me
of
course
they
intend
to
be
kind
and
of
course
i
should
be
civil
to
baxter
if
she
is
as
ugly
as
the
queen
of
the
cannibal
islands
so
say
any
more
about
her
i
suppose
she
is
elderly
and
fat
these
prosperous
people
are
always
fat
they
help
it
i
know
sure
said
geoffrey
listlessly
yes
i
remember
some
one
at
the
office
saying
baxter
was
much
younger
than
her
husband
an
heiress
too
i
believe
always
the
looked
weary
and
dispirited
and
marion
felt
remorseful
for
having
caused
it
so
she
played
to
him
front
room
actually
boasted
a
piano
such
as
it
was
soft
simple
he
was
no
connoisseur
in
he
went
to
sleep
on
the
hard
uncomfortable
little
sofa
of
the
regulation
pattern
the
designers
of
which
seem
to
be
under
the
impression
that
human
beings
can
at
pleasure
unhook
their
legs
and
fasten
them
on
again
sideways
in
which
posture
only
could
anything
like
comfortable
repose
be
possible
for
the
wretched
victims
of
upholstery
torture
baxter
was
as
good
as
her
word
or
rather
as
two
days
later
a
chariot
of
the
imposing
appearance
and
dimensions
suited
for
the
conveyance
of
a
millington
millionairess
drawn
by
two
prancing
greys
comfortably
conscious
of
their
own
amazingly
good
condition
and
unimpeachable
harness
drew
up
at
modest
door
a
gorgeous
footman
having
made
the
enquiry
necessary
to
preclude
the
possibility
of
his
getting
in
and
out
of
her
equipage
for
nothing
and
having
reported
to
the
lady
that
baldwin
was
at
home
or
as
factotum
expressed
it
the
door
of
the
chariot
opened
and
thence
emerged
one
of
the
very
smallest
women
marion
had
ever
seen
from
where
she
sat
all
that
passed
in
front
of
the
house
was
visible
to
baldwin
and
she
observed
with
considerable
amusement
the
immense
pomposity
of
the
whole
affair
resulting
in
the
appearance
of
the
almost
absurdly
minute
person
of
baxter
but
if
the
body
was
small
the
mind
evidently
felt
itself
great
no
or
nine
woman
ever
sailed
into
a
room
with
half
the
dignity
the
incomparable
de
of
little
baxter
it
had
done
her
good
service
in
her
day
this
magnificent
mien
of
hers
it
and
the
fact
of
her
being
dear
only
had
won
her
the
adoring
homage
of
various
young
millingtonians
more
inclined
to
spend
than
to
earn
had
finally
achieved
the
conquest
of
old
baxter
himself
and
now
in
these
latter
days
had
constituted
her
the
indisputable
queen
of
millington
society
awful
words
with
bated
breath
only
to
be
murmured
and
reverence
approaching
that
of
appleby
as
she
peeped
out
of
the
kitchen
at
the
end
of
the
passage
to
behold
though
at
a
distance
her
illustrious
visitor
for
baxter
was
not
in
the
least
pretty
her
or
as
dressmakers
say
was
the
whole
secret
of
the
admiration
she
excited
in
the
millington
world
it
was
thought
good
taste
to
admire
her
as
more
than
a
merely
pretty
person
was
a
faint
flavour
of
aristocratic
proclivities
in
the
refinement
of
perception
which
saw
more
in
this
little
woman
than
in
the
sweet
rosy
beauty
we
all
love
as
we
do
the
daisies
which
depends
not
on
the
sweep
of
the
robe
or
the
richness
of
the
material
in
which
it
is
clothed
for
though
i
tremble
while
saying
it
at
my
own
audacity
there
is
not
the
shadow
of
a
doubt
that
the
magnificence
of
baxter
was
more
than
half
due
to
her
clothes
the
other
half
lay
simply
in
her
entire
unimpregnable
a
quality
far
surpassing
the
fainter
shades
of
vanity
or
which
enabled
her
to
hold
her
small
person
erect
as
a
poker
which
would
have
carried
her
without
the
slightest
embarrassment
through
any
conceivable
womanly
ordeal
from
being
presented
at
court
to
rating
and
soundly
too
a
who
would
have
made
at
least
three
of
herself
ideas
i
was
going
to
say
she
had
none
but
this
is
incorrect
she
had
and
round
these
revolving
as
lesser
satellites
deriving
of
course
all
their
glory
from
the
greater
luminaries
little
you
could
hardly
have
called
her
she
was
rather
money
to
her
was
a
simple
fact
a
necessity
of
existence
like
the
air
we
breathe
the
blood
that
flows
in
our
veins
how
people
lived
without
it
had
once
or
twice
in
her
life
occurred
to
her
as
a
curious
problem
with
which
however
she
was
in
no
wise
concerned
any
more
than
one
might
be
with
the
manner
of
life
or
physical
peculiarities
of
the
inhabitants
of
one
of
the
fixed
stars
but
that
by
any
terrible
mistake
on
the
part
of
providence
she
or
baxter
or
any
of
the
little
baxters
could
ever
come
to
want
money
to
have
even
to
think
about
it
at
all
never
entered
the
somewhat
circumscribed
space
allotted
to
her
brain
there
were
poor
people
in
the
world
she
knew
at
least
if
questioned
on
the
subject
she
would
of
course
have
admitted
the
fact
adding
doubtless
that
baxter
gave
largely
to
charitable
institutions
and
that
she
herself
had
more
than
once
officiated
as
lady
patroness
at
some
fancy
fair
or
charity
ball
poor
people
in
the
world
yes
of
course
there
are
but
so
likewise
are
there
lions
and
tigers
and
various
species
of
ferocious
or
disagreeable
animals
black
beetles
and
toads
and
black
people
and
cannibals
who
eat
each
other
ugh
but
they
come
in
our
way
and
so
no
use
thinking
of
them
so
much
for
of
life
and
breeding
in
the
generally
accepted
sense
of
the
word
as
might
have
been
expected
from
her
millington
education
she
had
none
always
of
course
excepting
the
imposing
de
duchesse
which
really
was
very
wonderful
in
its
way
and
may
be
cited
as
an
instance
of
the
great
perfection
to
which
has
been
brought
in
these
modern
days
breeding
of
the
higher
kind
culture
of
mind
and
spirit
she
was
even
yet
more
deficient
in
under
no
possible
circumstances
indeed
could
such
have
been
attainable
by
her
to
any
great
extent
yet
after
all
she
was
far
from
a
bad
little
woman
only
her
light
was
so
very
small
not
even
sufficient
to
make
visible
to
the
owner
thereof
the
surrounding
darkness
which
quotation
is
hardly
applicable
to
immaterial
objects
for
we
are
not
spiritually
in
such
a
very
hopeless
condition
if
we
have
attained
to
a
perception
of
the
darkness
yet
to
be
dispersed
we
are
some
little
way
up
the
ladder
when
our
sight
descries
the
bewildering
multitude
of
rungs
yet
to
be
ascended
baxter
i
say
was
not
a
bad
little
woman
she
was
the
most
dutiful
of
wives
and
of
mothers
she
paid
her
bills
punctually
and
nursed
her
babies
irreproachably
which
latter
occupation
may
be
considered
as
the
great
end
of
her
existence
as
year
after
year
brought
a
new
olive
branch
to
the
baxter
nursery
each
in
turn
received
by
its
parents
with
perfect
equanimity
and
installed
in
its
place
as
a
member
of
the
august
household
she
went
to
church
twice
every
sunday
throughout
the
year
excepting
during
the
few
weeks
of
her
customary
retirement
she
never
lost
her
temper
and
she
spoke
kindly
to
the
housemaid
when
she
had
the
toothache
more
than
all
here
she
was
in
deference
to
her
wishes
performing
the
act
of
condescension
of
calling
on
the
wife
of
one
of
his
clerks
they
say
she
confided
to
one
of
her
female
admirers
have
seen
better
days
a
thing
i
specially
which
was
repeated
as
one
of
her
bons
mots
through
her
social
circle
i
was
forgetting
the
very
funniest
thing
about
this
little
without
one
spark
of
imagination
without
one
touch
of
humour
in
herself
or
power
of
appreciating
it
in
others
had
yet
acquired
in
the
small
world
in
which
she
moved
a
considerable
reputation
as
a
wit
this
was
the
lady
who
sailed
majestically
into
little
marion
whose
height
exceeded
that
of
the
average
of
women
rose
to
greet
her
feeling
as
sensitive
people
are
apt
to
do
when
forced
into
such
contrast
uncomfortably
taller
than
usual
but
this
sensation
was
speedily
succeeded
by
its
equally
unpleasant
opposite
for
seldom
in
her
life
had
baldwin
felt
herself
metaphorically
speaking
smaller
than
when
her
little
visitor
extended
her
tightly
gloved
hand
with
a
species
of
condescending
wave
and
addressing
her
in
what
was
intended
to
be
a
reassuring
tone
begged
her
to
reseat
herself
and
not
to
herself
on
her
account
almost
before
she
knew
what
she
was
about
marion
found
herself
waved
into
a
seat
while
baxter
proceeded
calmly
to
ensconce
herself
in
the
most
luxurious
of
the
not
very
tempting
chairs
of
the
little
then
the
great
little
lady
proceeded
to
enter
into
conversation
by
remarking
that
she
hoped
baldwin
liked
millington
yes
replied
marion
like
it
very
well
of
course
it
takes
some
time
to
feel
at
home
in
a
perfectly
strange
daresay
you
find
it
very
different
from
living
in
the
country
observed
baxter
with
an
accent
of
superb
scorn
on
the
last
word
my
part
i
abide
the
country
people
grow
so
stupid
and
compared
to
what
they
are
in
town
baxter
talks
sometimes
of
buying
a
but
i
always
tell
him
i
really
do
at
all
without
my
six
months
at
least
in
marion
felt
slightly
puzzled
as
to
the
exact
sense
in
which
her
visitor
was
making
use
of
the
last
word
do
you
at
present
spend
half
the
year
in
town
she
asked
cautiously
the
year
repeated
baxter
dear
yes
three
quarters
at
least
we
spend
a
month
or
two
at
the
in
summer
it
suits
very
well
as
it
generally
happens
so
that
i
want
a
little
change
just
then
all
the
children
except
the
twins
were
born
in
spring
and
nothing
sets
one
up
like
the
then
there
fell
a
little
pause
experience
in
the
matters
referred
to
by
the
lady
not
being
sufficiently
extensive
for
her
to
hazard
an
observation
in
the
presence
of
one
evidently
thoroughly
on
the
subject
baxter
swung
herself
round
on
her
chair
and
scrutinized
her
surroundings
never
was
in
this
street
before
she
remarked
was
afraid
the
coachman
would
never
find
the
house
but
the
footman
knew
it
because
his
sister
who
is
a
dressmaker
lives
a
little
higher
up
baxter
never
likes
me
to
go
through
back
streets
for
fear
of
infections
and
those
sort
of
things
but
he
made
a
point
of
my
calling
on
you
more
than
a
week
ago
he
asked
me
to
do
him
a
favour
and
this
was
what
it
was
i
hope
you
stayed
in
for
me
though
all
this
time
baxter
has
taken
quite
a
fancy
to
your
husband
baldwin
so
regular
and
steady
in
his
hours
and
quite
a
gentleman
he
said
so
i
assure
you
young
baldwin
is
really
quite
a
gentleman
he
said
to
me
face
flushed
think
perhaps
baxter
she
began
hardly
but
the
voluble
little
woman
interrupted
her
was
forgetting
she
exclaimed
baxter
wished
me
to
fix
a
day
for
your
dining
with
us
just
in
a
family
way
nothing
of
a
party
i
thought
most
likely
you
would
like
better
coming
to
luncheon
but
he
said
it
would
be
rather
too
far
for
your
husband
to
walk
backwards
and
forwards
between
business
hours
he
dines
in
town
i
suppose
all
the
clerks
do
i
think
of
course
we
dine
late
i
mean
an
early
dinner
at
six
we
dine
and
for
once
in
a
way
i
daresay
baldwin
could
get
away
from
business
early
will
wednesday
do
i
expect
some
of
friends
to
be
with
us
so
it
will
be
quite
a
family
are
very
kind
marion
forced
herself
to
say
have
not
gone
into
company
at
all
since
we
came
here
as
i
daresay
you
can
make
any
apologies
said
baxter
course
i
ask
you
except
in
an
unceremonious
way
trouble
yourself
about
dressing
or
anything
of
that
sort
you
will
do
very
nicely
i
am
sure
a
high
black
silk
or
even
a
merino
will
do
quite
well
of
course
i
always
wear
a
low
dress
in
the
evening
but
then
was
not
on
account
of
my
dress
i
was
hesitating
said
marion
quietly
was
doubtful
whether
baldwin
would
like
the
idea
of
going
out
to
dinner
even
in
the
unceremonious
way
you
but
if
you
tell
him
baxter
will
really
make
a
point
of
it
urged
the
dutiful
wife
whose
desire
to
carry
the
day
evidently
increased
with
the
little
expected
hesitation
she
met
with
on
part
baldwin
is
sure
to
agree
to
my
this
not
very
delicately
expressed
reminder
of
the
relations
between
the
two
men
had
its
effect
with
a
strong
effort
of
marion
answered
gravely
daresay
you
are
right
baxter
then
i
think
i
may
say
we
shall
hope
to
have
the
pleasure
of
dining
with
you
next
her
mission
thus
successfully
accomplished
the
visitor
took
her
leave
sailing
out
of
the
room
as
majestically
as
she
had
entered
and
in
another
minute
the
magnificent
equipage
of
the
millington
millionaire
rolled
away
in
ponderous
grandeur
from
door
marion
shook
herself
and
stamped
her
feet
then
catching
the
reflection
of
herself
in
the
little
mirror
above
the
she
laughed
at
her
own
childishness
silly
i
am
to
mind
it
she
said
to
herself
what
a
woman
how
thankful
i
am
it
is
not
her
children
but
that
nice
kindly
i
am
going
to
teach
i
am
not
at
all
sure
that
baxter
would
have
asked
us
to
dinner
if
she
had
known
i
am
was
engaged
to
give
daily
lessons
i
wish
i
had
told
her
it
would
have
been
such
fun
to
have
seen
her
face
i
must
not
tell
geoffrey
much
about
her
it
would
infuriate
him
and
after
all
i
suppose
she
means
to
be
kind
but
the
idea
of
her
telling
me
my
husband
was
really
quite
a
gentleman
my
geoffrey
my
poor
geoffrey
what
a
vivid
idea
this
gives
me
of
what
he
must
have
to
endure
among
these
people
in
his
daily
life
and
how
uncomplainingly
he
bears
it
at
least
let
me
do
my
part
to
smooth
things
to
she
kept
her
resolution
when
geoffrey
returned
home
in
the
evening
marion
told
him
in
the
simplest
most
way
of
visit
and
invitation
is
kind
of
them
to
ask
us
she
said
i
thought
it
best
not
to
chill
or
hurt
them
by
declining
geoffrey
looked
thoughtful
he
replied
at
last
think
you
did
right
to
accept
it
it
goes
rather
against
the
grain
and
no
doubt
it
will
be
rather
an
ordeal
to
both
of
us
but
you
did
right
dear
as
you
always
do
he
added
fondly
marion
had
her
reward
sort
of
a
person
is
baxter
he
asked
presently
little
woman
replied
marion
pretty
but
very
well
dressed
rather
lively
too
at
least
with
plenty
to
say
for
herself
too
i
should
think
though
of
course
not
very
refined
but
we
got
on
very
he
looked
relieved
am
glad
you
did
not
find
it
very
he
said
all
dear
it
may
be
a
good
thing
for
you
to
have
a
few
acquaintances
here
and
even
a
family
dinner
at
the
may
be
a
little
variety
for
she
was
leaving
the
room
as
he
spoke
as
she
passed
him
she
stooped
and
kissed
his
forehead
as
he
lay
back
on
the
regulation
sofa
dear
geoffrey
she
said
have
no
doubt
it
will
be
rather
amusing
than
otherwise
besides
it
is
always
interesting
and
good
for
one
to
see
the
different
sorts
of
people
there
are
in
this
queer
he
caught
her
hands
and
clasped
them
in
his
own
looking
up
at
her
with
ineffable
tenderness
in
his
eyes
he
said
again
as
he
had
said
a
few
evenings
before
darling
you
are
an
angel
he
had
no
great
command
of
language
you
see
poor
fellow
chapter
ix
and
a
oh
we
grudged
her
sair
to
the
land
the
leal
scotch
ballad
what
sort
of
a
person
did
you
say
baldwin
was
my
dear
enquired
baxter
of
his
wife
when
the
engrossing
ceremonial
of
the
correct
four
or
five
courses
having
been
gone
through
for
the
day
he
established
himself
in
heavy
comfort
on
one
of
the
gorgeous
gold
and
blue
couches
in
that
she
seems
a
nice
enough
young
woman
replied
baxter
too
in
her
manners
for
my
taste
of
course
she
was
very
plainly
dressed
and
is
quite
without
any
sort
of
style
but
these
people
always
are
besides
she
has
been
brought
up
in
a
very
plain
sort
of
way
i
suppose
you
say
she
was
the
daughter
of
some
poor
country
clergyman
really
know
who
she
was
answered
the
husband
friend
who
introduced
baldwin
merely
said
he
was
married
he
himself
is
so
superior
looking
a
young
man
i
could
have
imagined
his
having
rather
a
nice
wife
but
as
you
say
country
breeding
always
shows
more
in
a
woman
than
a
baxter
had
not
said
anything
half
so
original
but
took
care
to
pocket
the
observation
for
future
use
a
little
feat
she
was
rather
clever
at
performing
say
she
nice
she
replied
only
said
she
any
you
asked
them
for
wednesday
pursued
baxter
day
do
you
expect
and
william
i
really
replied
the
lady
that
great
trollopy
maria
jane
of
theirs
why
they
have
her
at
home
i
imagine
william
writes
she
is
so
much
improved
by
that
new
school
she
is
growing
quite
a
fine
girl
fine
girl
indeed
she
will
be
six
feet
if
she
leave
growing
she
at
school
now
enquired
baxter
lazily
was
a
holiday
because
of
some
death
in
the
family
replied
baxter
carelessly
that
reminds
me
baxter
phillips
wants
to
go
home
for
a
week
his
sister
is
dead
and
he
wants
to
go
to
the
funeral
so
inconvenient
too
just
as
and
william
are
coming
i
abide
any
one
but
phillips
driving
me
it
shakes
my
nerves
to
bits
and
makes
me
all
over
it
was
to
do
her
justice
very
seldom
that
baxter
fell
short
in
this
way
but
now
and
then
when
somewhat
excited
her
were
apt
to
totter
him
he
go
then
said
monsieur
sleepily
for
the
combined
influences
of
his
three
glasses
of
port
the
fire
and
the
blue
and
gold
sofa
were
growing
too
much
for
him
and
to
tell
the
truth
for
baxter
too
so
till
startled
by
the
entrance
of
jeames
and
tea
the
millionaire
and
his
wife
slumbered
peacefully
though
in
one
case
sonorously
on
each
side
of
that
marvel
of
tiles
and
burnished
steel
and
resplendent
gilding
which
to
them
served
as
the
representation
of
their
wednesday
came
and
at
six
in
the
evening
thereof
and
baldwin
the
poorer
for
the
fly
which
had
conveyed
them
from
their
to
the
millington
west
end
where
the
baxter
residence
was
situated
made
their
appearance
in
the
blue
and
gold
somewhat
against
her
wishes
geoffrey
had
insisted
on
attiring
herself
in
a
manner
more
befitting
the
wife
of
the
rich
baldwin
of
brackley
manor
than
the
helpmeet
of
one
of
clerks
on
a
salary
one
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
a
year
your
dresses
are
worn
out
and
i
afford
to
buy
you
more
he
said
with
some
slight
bitterness
in
his
tone
you
may
go
about
in
brown
stuff
if
you
like
or
black
more
likely
he
added
in
an
undertone
with
as
near
an
approach
to
a
cynical
smile
as
was
possible
for
him
i
live
to
see
it
by
then
it
is
to
be
hoped
you
will
be
free
of
the
curse
i
have
been
to
you
one
way
and
another
my
poor
darling
and
with
the
last
words
though
only
whispered
to
himself
there
stole
into
his
voice
spite
of
his
bitter
mood
an
inflection
of
exquisite
tenderness
so
the
dress
in
which
marion
baldwin
made
her
début
into
at
home
socially
speaking
though
plain
was
of
the
richest
and
best
as
to
fashion
colour
and
material
baxter
positively
started
as
he
caught
sight
of
her
baxter
even
felt
a
little
taken
aback
not
by
the
woman
herself
but
by
her
clothes
the
quality
of
which
her
feminine
acuteness
was
not
slow
to
estimate
as
it
deserved
into
such
particulars
of
course
baxter
in
common
with
his
sex
did
not
enter
but
the
effect
of
the
whole
the
tout
ensemble
presented
by
wife
struck
him
with
admiration
and
surprise
he
muttered
to
himself
seems
to
me
my
dear
sophia
you
have
made
a
little
mistake
for
though
the
range
of
his
ideas
was
not
so
limited
nor
their
circle
so
circumscribed
as
was
the
case
with
those
possessed
by
his
wife
brain
work
of
any
kind
even
though
it
be
confined
to
invoices
and
and
never
soar
above
the
usual
round
of
mercantile
interests
and
excitements
having
an
innate
tendency
to
develop
generally
the
mental
faculties
and
widen
their
grasp
the
was
a
very
gorgeous
affair
besides
and
william
and
the
maria
jane
there
were
some
six
or
eight
of
the
habitués
of
the
baxter
circle
making
in
all
a
company
of
fourteen
or
fifteen
guests
dinner
announced
marion
to
her
surprise
and
the
secret
chagrin
of
the
observant
hostess
found
herself
selected
by
baxter
to
occupy
the
place
of
honour
at
his
right
just
however
as
she
was
placing
her
hand
on
the
old
arm
to
her
amazement
a
sudden
rush
if
so
undignified
a
word
may
be
applied
to
the
movements
of
so
stately
a
lady
was
made
from
the
other
side
of
the
room
by
baxter
and
a
tall
man
to
whom
she
had
the
look
of
acting
as
a
small
but
energetic
tug
the
pair
pushed
their
way
to
the
front
of
the
company
and
marion
beheld
for
the
first
time
the
unusual
spectacle
of
the
hostess
preceding
her
guests
to
her
own
cheeks
despite
her
philosophy
flushed
this
she
said
to
herself
done
intentionally
to
insult
me
i
mind
for
myself
but
if
geoffrey
thinks
that
little
woman
is
rude
to
me
it
will
make
him
so
angry
and
our
coming
here
will
have
done
more
harm
than
somewhat
anxiously
she
glanced
up
at
face
to
see
what
he
thought
of
this
extraordinary
procedure
on
the
part
of
his
wife
the
worthy
gentleman
was
smiling
blandly
and
modestly
made
way
for
the
advancing
couples
as
one
by
one
they
filed
out
of
the
room
till
at
last
his
occupation
at
an
end
he
and
his
bewildered
charge
brought
up
the
rear
and
crossing
the
tesselated
hall
through
a
double
row
of
jeamses
took
their
places
at
table
evidently
nothing
in
what
had
occurred
had
in
the
least
astonished
him
the
whole
therefore
must
have
been
thoroughly
regle
according
to
millington
ideas
thought
mistress
marion
to
herself
sententiously
as
her
gaze
fell
first
on
the
splendour
of
the
table
appointments
and
next
on
the
faces
surrounding
her
and
she
began
to
realize
something
of
the
wonders
of
cottonocracy
the
talent
and
energy
which
have
made
it
what
it
is
the
extraordinary
contrasts
and
inconsistencies
discernible
in
its
social
aspects
thought
to
herself
wife
of
one
of
clerks
live
and
learn
and
do
the
wiser
glancing
across
the
table
she
caught
sight
at
the
other
end
of
face
and
a
smile
on
it
brought
a
bright
expression
to
her
own
he
looked
cheery
and
comfortable
enough
which
it
relieved
her
to
see
and
in
the
very
bottom
of
her
heart
she
though
sitting
there
as
dressed
as
the
children
say
as
any
at
table
felt
not
a
little
glad
that
for
once
in
a
way
her
poor
boy
was
sure
of
a
really
good
dinner
and
as
many
glasses
of
excellent
wine
as
his
extremely
temperate
habits
would
allow
him
to
consume
for
with
all
her
housewifely
care
their
living
at
was
necessarily
of
the
plainest
and
sometimes
marion
had
sharp
misgivings
that
this
among
other
things
was
beginning
to
tell
on
health
he
professed
to
dine
or
lunch
in
millington
but
as
often
as
not
his
wife
suspected
that
the
meal
was
nothing
more
substantial
than
a
biscuit
for
all
their
funds
passed
through
her
hands
and
out
of
the
infinitesimal
sum
which
was
all
she
could
persuade
him
to
appropriate
to
his
personal
expenses
very
few
luncheons
worthy
of
the
name
it
was
evident
even
to
her
inexperience
could
be
provided
one
of
these
sudden
misgivings
visited
her
just
now
as
glancing
again
in
her
direction
she
observed
attentively
his
face
this
time
turned
from
her
surely
the
profile
was
sharper
than
of
yore
the
more
defined
the
hollow
round
the
eye
strangely
deeper
a
sort
of
mist
came
before
her
sight
and
into
her
mind
there
flashed
one
of
those
commonplace
sayings
household
aphorisms
to
which
till
they
touch
us
practically
we
pay
so
little
heed
is
not
always
the
men
that
stand
the
most
or
are
the
wiriest
she
had
heard
said
a
hundred
times
without
considering
the
meaning
of
the
words
now
however
they
suddenly
started
before
her
invested
with
new
force
and
significance
and
she
was
rapidly
falling
into
a
painful
reverie
when
she
was
recalled
to
present
surroundings
by
the
fat
commonplace
voice
of
her
host
remarking
to
her
by
way
of
saying
something
original
that
hoped
she
liked
much
in
the
same
words
as
she
had
replied
to
the
same
observation
on
the
part
of
mrs
baxter
marion
answered
yes
she
liked
it
very
well
doubtless
in
time
she
would
like
it
you
have
made
a
few
more
friends
here
perhaps
said
the
gentleman
civilly
am
sorry
my
wife
was
so
long
of
calling
on
you
but
to
tell
you
the
truth
it
was
not
till
lately
i
was
aware
my
friend
baldwin
was
a
fib
of
course
or
at
least
of
one
was
very
kind
of
baxter
to
call
said
marion
with
a
simple
dignity
that
was
not
lost
on
her
hearer
you
i
know
baxter
have
been
very
kind
to
geoffrey
when
we
came
here
of
course
it
was
with
no
idea
of
living
in
any
but
the
most
retired
way
i
hardly
indeed
expected
to
make
any
acquaintances
at
expectation
which
for
the
sake
of
millington
i
certainly
trust
may
not
be
fulfilled
replied
baxter
gallantly
marion
smiled
and
accepted
the
little
compliment
with
her
usual
unaffectedness
have
been
accustomed
to
a
country
life
i
believe
continued
the
host
replied
she
the
last
two
years
i
lived
principally
in
remarked
the
gentleman
and
forthwith
discarded
the
hypothesis
sophia
had
been
at
fault
somehow
he
began
to
feel
sure
he
rather
enjoyed
the
idea
of
reminding
her
of
her
enough
young
but
in
the
first
place
he
must
make
sure
of
his
own
ground
father
i
believe
was
in
the
church
he
enquired
gingerly
no
she
replied
still
though
beginning
to
think
that
all
this
must
surely
be
another
peculiarity
of
millington
manners
father
was
not
a
clergyman
at
one
time
of
his
life
i
believe
it
was
proposed
he
should
go
into
the
church
as
one
of
his
livings
was
vacant
but
he
did
not
like
the
idea
and
never
entered
any
profession
unless
you
call
politics
hard
work
and
very
poor
pay
any
way
replied
baxter
rubbing
his
hands
in
a
manner
thank
my
stars
i
had
never
anything
to
say
to
them
then
your
late
father
was
i
suppose
a
hem
said
marion
simply
my
name
was
say
so
i
beg
your
pardon
exclaimed
baxter
though
why
he
did
so
marion
could
not
quite
understand
upon
my
sophia
i
shall
have
a
little
crow
to
pluck
with
strange
audibly
again
strange
i
never
heard
it
a
great
loss
to
his
country
a
very
great
loss
was
vere
your
father
well
to
be
sure
ah
and
with
a
series
of
such
little
detached
fragmentary
observations
the
worthy
gentleman
composed
his
somewhat
startled
nerves
the
rest
of
dinner
passed
uneventfully
enough
marion
got
on
decidedly
better
with
the
gentleman
than
she
had
done
with
the
lady
and
baxter
on
his
part
mentally
pronounced
her
a
most
charming
woman
neighbour
at
table
was
the
maria
jane
so
cuttingly
described
by
her
aunt
as
she
was
tall
certainly
for
her
age
rather
alarmingly
so
with
the
possibility
in
prospect
of
continuing
to
grow
some
four
or
five
years
to
come
and
thin
very
thin
to
use
another
of
favourite
expressions
but
at
her
age
thinness
lankiness
even
if
the
word
be
preferred
has
when
coupled
with
gentleness
and
perfect
absence
of
affectation
to
my
mind
a
certain
touching
appealing
sweetness
of
its
own
but
this
of
course
is
a
matter
of
opinion
it
may
be
very
bad
taste
but
i
have
rather
a
horror
off
fat
young
girls
maria
jane
baxter
was
however
really
and
truly
a
very
sweet
girl
heart
she
very
speedily
won
for
before
they
had
been
ten
minutes
at
table
she
asked
him
timidly
if
he
could
tell
her
the
name
of
lovely
young
lady
on
her
so
he
and
she
as
might
have
been
expected
from
this
auspicious
commencement
very
speedily
made
friends
and
when
the
ladies
retired
after
dinner
to
the
maria
jane
took
care
to
establish
herself
in
a
modest
corner
not
far
from
attractive
wife
the
conversation
of
the
elder
ladies
was
to
marion
so
utterly
uninteresting
to
say
the
least
that
it
was
with
a
feeling
of
immense
relief
that
she
heard
herself
accosted
by
name
by
a
gentle
voice
asking
if
she
would
like
to
examine
a
collection
of
really
beautiful
engravings
in
a
portfolio
on
the
table
baldwin
responded
cordially
to
the
young
modest
attention
over
the
engravings
they
fell
into
conversation
you
draw
miss
baxter
marion
happened
to
ask
little
replied
the
girl
is
i
am
very
fond
of
it
and
my
master
thinks
i
have
taste
for
it
but
lately
i
have
had
to
give
it
up
as
at
the
school
where
i
am
now
they
were
afraid
of
its
making
me
you
are
at
a
i
suppose
enquired
marion
was
never
at
school
myself
but
sometimes
being
an
only
daughter
i
used
to
wish
my
father
would
send
me
are
you
happy
at
your
school
replied
maria
heartily
is
a
very
nice
school
it
is
not
like
those
you
read
of
where
the
girls
are
harshly
treated
we
have
such
pretty
little
only
two
in
each
i
have
a
little
girl
in
mine
whom
i
take
care
of
she
has
only
lately
come
and
at
first
she
was
very
lonely
poor
lotty
but
now
she
is
getting
accustomed
to
it
she
is
very
fond
of
me
poor
child
maria
felt
so
perfectly
at
ease
with
her
new
friend
that
she
waxed
communicative
in
a
wonderful
way
did
you
say
your
name
was
said
marion
once
knew
a
little
girl
named
what
memories
what
associations
the
simple
word
recalled
baldwin
repeated
half
mechanically
is
her
other
name
miss
baxter
replied
the
girl
severn
charlotte
severn
that
is
to
say
she
added
glibly
is
an
orphan
her
father
was
a
baronet
and
now
her
uncle
is
one
she
has
always
been
brought
up
at
home
till
lately
but
about
six
months
ago
her
little
maria
stopped
something
in
look
of
intense
interest
arrested
her
little
i
know
exclaimed
marion
on
please
miss
baxter
i
want
to
hear
very
much
you
know
how
much
only
say
that
like
to
tell
you
said
maria
looking
frightened
and
half
ready
to
cry
go
on
repeated
her
companion
little
little
sister
sybil
she
has
often
told
me
her
look
so
dear
baldwin
you
frighten
sybil
died
six
months
ago
that
was
why
they
sent
lotty
to
school
she
was
pining
so
for
her
sybil
my
dear
little
sybil
my
poor
little
dove
moaned
marion
to
herself
but
softly
so
softly
that
no
one
of
the
millington
ladies
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
could
have
suspected
the
sad
little
tragedy
taking
place
so
near
them
you
are
gone
my
little
girl
my
gentle
darling
and
i
not
to
have
known
it
could
you
not
have
stopped
an
instant
on
your
way
to
kiss
me
goodbye
as
you
used
to
say
and
the
only
creature
left
to
him
to
love
she
murmured
in
a
yet
more
inaudible
whisper
though
her
former
words
had
hardly
reached
the
oars
of
the
sympathizing
girl
beside
her
for
a
few
moments
there
was
silence
at
the
little
side
table
whereon
lay
the
book
of
costly
engravings
then
marion
with
a
strong
effort
recovered
herself
and
looking
up
said
gently
me
miss
baxter
i
loved
that
little
girl
very
much
and
till
now
i
had
no
idea
of
this
will
you
be
so
very
good
as
tell
me
all
poor
lotty
told
you
her
does
not
very
often
speak
about
her
said
maria
was
told
not
to
encourage
her
to
do
so
very
much
as
it
makes
her
cry
dreadfully
so
i
know

eagerly

that

gratitude

the

i
will
give
her
your
you

much

marion

as
she

towards

the
company
for
the
gentlemen

just
entered
the
room
and
baxter
was
bearing
down
upon
her
mind
my
asking
you
not
to
mention
what
we
have
been
talking
about
to
any
one
i
will
not
answered
maria
would
not
have
done
so
even
if
you
had
not
asked
for
the
girl
felt
instinctively
that
her
disclosure
had
trenched
on
sacred
ground
and
from
what
she
had
gathered
of
history
from
allusions
during
dinner
she
was
quite
aware
that
it
had
been
a
somewhat
eventful
one
you
again
said
marion
and
for
an
instant
pressed
the
young
hand
in
her
own
and
the
poor
beautiful
wife
and
the
rich
young
daughter
though
they
had
never
seen
each
other
before
and
would
probably
enough
never
see
each
other
again
felt
more
like
friends
than
many
women
who
have
lived
for
years

each
constant
companionship

the

young

received
the
honour
of
morning
calls
from
some
half
dozen
more
or
less
distinguished
millington
matrons
for
a
short
time
indeed
marion
ran
some
chance
of
becoming
the
fashion
but
as
the
prospect
was
not
a
tempting
one
and
the
horrors
of
being
patronised
did
not
diminish
on
nearer
view
she
managed
quietly
though
without
giving
offence
to
let
her
new
acquaintances
understand
that
she
and
her
husband
were
of
one
mind
as
to
the
expediency
of
living
in
a
perfectly
retired
manner
out
of
the
world
baxter
called
it
and
though
marion
smiled
inwardly
at
the
millington
notion
of
society
she
had
the
good
sense
to
say
nothing
which
could
have
uselessly
irritated
the
wife
of
superior
indeed
would
it
be
right
not
to
seem
to
appreciate
what
they
think
so
attractive
said
she
to
her
husband
after
all
though
our
ways
of
looking
at
things
may
be
utterly
different
they
are
in
their
own
way
worthy
people
and
i
suppose
they
mean
to
be
kind
to
suppose
they
do
said
geoffrey
i
stand
many
of
those
dreadfully
heavy
dinners
even
if
we
could
afford
the
cabs
which
we
the
bottom
of
her
heart
i
think
baxter
is
by
no
means
sorry
that
we
have
decided
against
said
marion
make
her
out
she
has
been
so
wonderfully
civil
to
me
since
we
dined
there
notwithstanding
the
dreadful
revelation
of
my
teaching
boys
but
yet
i
am
certain
she
is
not
sincere
in
so
urging
us
to
accept
her
is
a
nasty
little
cat
said
geoffrey
ready
to
scratch
your
eyes
out
because
old
baxter
has
gone
about
praising
you
an
old
goose
not
for
admiring
you
i
mean
that
but
he
talks
in
such
an
absurd
pompous
way
all
the
same
a
long
way
better
than
his
wife
for
honest
and
not
what
a
nice
girl
that
little
niece
was
we
met
there
the
tall
thin
girl
i
assented
marion
and
then
her
thoughts
recurred
to
what
had
been
little
absent
from
them
for
some
tidings
which
had
so
strangely
reached
her
of
gentle
death
she
had
not
told
geoffrey
about
it
he
had
never
heard
any
particulars
of
her
life
at
altes
and
had
she
told
him
any
she
must
have
told
him
all
which
on
the
whole
she
felt
convinced
was
better
not
there
was
nothing
really
to
be
concealed
nothing
of
which
she
was
ashamed
years
hence
some
day
when
they
had
left
all
the
past
further
behind
she
would
perhaps
tell
him
the
whole
story
but
not
just
yet
she
had
wounded
him
once
so
deeply
that
even
now
there
were
times
at
which
she
doubted
if
all
was
thoroughly
healed
though
for
the
last
six
months
each
day
had
but
served
to
draw
them
closer
together
in
a
way
that
but
for
their
loss
of
wealth
it
might
have
taken
years
to
achieve
they
were
very
happy
together
still
geoffrey
was
at
times
dull
and
depressed
almost
to
morbidness
and
though
marion
correctly
enough
attributed
these
moody
fits
greatly
to
outside
circumstances
she
yet
could
not
but
fear
that
to
some
extent
they
arose
from
misgivings
as
to
her
happiness
exaggerated
for
what
he
had
brought
upon
her
at
such
times
she
found
it
best
to
ignore
in
great
measure
his
depression
protestations
of
affection
did
not
come
naturally
to
her
nor
would
they
have
convinced
him
of
what
if
he
did
doubt
it
time
alone
would
prove
genuine
her
devotion
to
him
in
practical
matters
at
such
times
even
seemed
to
deepen
his
gloom
are
too
good
to
me
far
too
good
he
would
say
but
with
a
tone
as
of
disclaiming
his
right
to
such
goodness
inexpressibly
painful
to
her
at
other
times
again
he
would
brighten
up
wonderfully
and
anxiety
about
him
physically
and
mentally
would
temporarily
slumber
so
the
days
wore
on
till
it
grew
to
be
within
about
three
weeks
of
christmas
the
engagement
with
allen
which
had
been
punctually
fulfilled
was
drawing
to
a
close
much
to
regret
for
the
five
guineas
a
month
had
proved
a
very
acceptable
addition
to
modest
salary
and
the
task
till
latterly
had
seemed
a
light
and
pleasant
one
allen
had
shown
herself
most
consistently
kind
and
considerate
many
a
day
she
had
suddenly
discovered
a
pressing
errand
at
the
other
side
of
millington
obliging
her
to
drive
in
the
direction
of
brewer
street
where
mansion
was
situated
curiously
enough
at
the
very
hour
of
return
thither
as
it
happens
my
dear
the
worthy
lad
would
say
can
give
you
a
lift
home
without
taking
me
five
yards
the
little
boys
were
very
nice
children
gentle
and
teachable
the
youngest
one
indeed
rather
unusually
and
precociously
intelligent
but
as
is
generally
the
case
with
such
children
physically
speaking
fragile
to
a
degree
they
were
the
youngest
and
only
remaining
of
a
large
family
all
of
whom
had
dropped
off
one
by
one
as
the
mother
expressed
it
like
buds
with
no
life
in
them
how
it
should
be
the
young
ones
come
to
be
so
delicate
considering
how
strong
papa
and
i
are
i
understand
said
allen
to
marion
as
she
wiped
away
a
few
tears
one
day
when
she
had
been
relating
the
history
of
her
successive
bereavements
as
the
weather
grew
colder
geoffrey
seemed
to
feel
stronger
the
long
walk
to
and
from
warehouse
was
not
half
so
trying
to
him
in
winter
as
in
the
close
oppressive
days
of
their
first
coming
to
millington
but
it
was
not
so
with
marion
day
after
day
she
felt
her
strength
mysteriously
diminishing
and
as
the
last
week
of
her
daily
giving
approached
she
felt
thankful
that
the
engagement
was
so
near
its
termination
for
easy
as
the
task
had
been
she
felt
that
it
was
growing
too
much
for
her
one
morning
the
boys
had
been
a
little
more
troublesome
than
usual
and
she
herself
by
the
close
of
the
lesson
felt
utterly
exhausted
the
children
had
run
out
to
their
play
she
was
alone
in
the
putting
on
her
bonnet
and
cloak
preparatory
to
her
long
walk
home
to
brewer
street
when
the
door
opened
suddenly
and
allen
appeared
she
had
come
good
soul
with
her
usual
transparent
little
fib
about
having
to
drive
in
direction
but
before
she
had
time
to
explain
her
errand
to
her
surprise
and
alarm
marion
burst
into
a
violent
fit
of
weeping
is
the
matter
dear
baldwin
tell
me
i
pray
you
said
the
woman
the
boys
been
teasing
you
or
are
you
not
feeling
well
this
morning
marion
tried
to
answer
her
enquiries
but
for
some
minutes
could
not
control
her
voice
sufficiently
to
do
so
allen
fetched
a
glass
of
wine
which
she
made
her
drink
part
of
and
in
a
short
time
the
poor
girl
was
well
enough
to
speak
as
quietly
as
usual
and
smile
at
her
own
fit
of
she
assured
allen
had
no
reason
for
crying
alfred
was
rather
slower
than
usual
at
his
sums
but
he
was
perfectly
good
poor
little
fellow
i
may
have
been
a
little
tired
by
that
however
it
is
the
only
thing
i
can
think
of
she
hesitated
what
my
dear
urged
allen
marion
looked
up
at
the
kind
motherly
face
its
expression
invited
confidence
tell
anyone
what
i
am
going
to
say
dear
allen
said
she
laying
her
hand
appealingly
on
her
arm
i
can
not
help
feeling
it
would
be
a
relief
to
tell
do
you
know
i
am
afraid
i
am
getting
ill
sometimes
i
feel
as
if
i
must
really
be
going
to
die
i
am
so
dreadfully
weak
and
every
day
i
feel
more
so
it
is
making
the
very
miserable
for
i
know
how
geoffrey
could
live
without
me
and
my
falling
ill
would
be
such
a
fearful
aggravation
of
all
his
she
looked
as
if
she
were
ready
to
burst
out
crying
again
allen
made
her
finish
her
wine
and
then
said
very
kindly
think
you
are
going
to
die
dear
baldwin
but
i
certainly
think
you
must
take
more
care
of
yourself
for
i
am
sure
you
need
it
you
are
very
young
and
inexperienced
my
dear
i
should
like
you
to
see
a
think
it
would
be
any
use
said
marion
sadly
she
added
her
face
flushing
are
so
expensive
and
my
seeing
one
would
alarm
geoffrey
so
of
all
things
i
wish
to
avoid
doing
so
till
i
am
obliged
i
may
get
round
again
gradually
when
the
weather
is
my
dear
persisted
allen
does
not
do
to
trust
to
get
you
must
see
a
doctor
and
if
you
want
to
alarm
your
husband
tell
you
how
manage
it
if
you
will
stay
just
now
to
early
dinner
with
me
and
the
boys
whenever
over
take
you
to
our
own
doctor
as
nice
a
man
as
ever
lived
go
with
me
you
know
in
an
easy
sort
of
way
nothing
to
pay
this
time
any
way
tell
him
i
brought
you
a
little
against
your
will
anxious
about
you
if
he
goes
to
see
you
at
your
own
house
again
be
another
affair
be
like
as
might
be
my
marion
gratefully
agreed
to
the
arrangement
so
thoughtfully
proposed
which
was
accordingly
carried
out
nothing
could
exceed
motherly
kindness
and
marion
felt
not
a
little
thankful
for
her
presence
and
sympathy
for
wholly
unexpected
and
somewhat
overwhelming
was
solution
of
her
mysterious
loss
of
strength
was
she
sorry
or
glad
she
asked
herself
when
set
down
at
her
own
door
by
her
friend
she
had
an
hour
or
quiet
to
think
over
this
little
intelligence
before
the
usual
time
for
return
from
business
she
could
not
tell
if
they
had
still
been
rich
she
thought
to
herself
this
new
prospect
before
her
would
have
been
one
of
unalloyed
rejoicing
but
now
they
were
so
poor
and
she
feared
much
the
thought
of
another
being
dependent
on
his
unaided
exertions
would
sadly
deepen
the
lines
already
creeping
round
fair
boyish
face
would
quickly
mingle
grey
hairs
with
the
golden
ones
she
had
learnt
to
love
so
fondly
and
then
there
came
back
to
her
recollection
the
words
of
lady
anne
that
day
at
copley
wood
when
she
had
been
so
frightened
about
geoffrey
and
had
yet
been
cruel
enough
to
chill
him
by
her
affected
indifference
to
his
safe
return
is
so
fond
of
children
had
said
lady
anne
he
still
feel
so
marion
asked
herself
she
could
not
make
up
her
mind
so
she
kept
her
news
to
herself
for
a
while
but
when
at
last
one
day
she
confided
it
to
her
husband
she
almost
repented
not
having
done
so
before
the
relief
to
him
was
so
immense
of
having
a
satisfactory
explanation
of
failing
health
and
wearied
looks
that
all
other
considerations
faded
into
insignificance
he
had
been
watching
her
though
silently
with
the
most
intense
anxiety
and
though
fearful
of
distressing
her
by
objecting
to
the
fulfilment
of
her
engagement
with
allen
had
been
counting
the
days
till
it
should
be
at
an
end
my
darling
he
said
am
so
thankful
so
very
thankful
it
is
this
and
not
worse
for
the
last
week
or
two
i
have
been
in
such
misery
about
you
i
saw
how
ill
you
you
growing
weaker
and
weaker
before
my
eyes
without
knowing
what
to
do
i
seemed
paralyzed
when
i
first
realized
that
it
was
not
only
my
fancy
and
yet
i
dreaded
startling
you
by
noticing
it
only
i
had
made
up
my
mind
to
write
to
veronica
and
ask
her
to
arrange
for
your
going
to
her
for
the
rest
of
the
winter
i
thought
this
place
was
killing
you
and
yet
i
could
not
endure
the
thought
of
parting
with
do
you
think
i
would
have
left
you
geoffrey
she
whispered
feared
you
would
object
to
it
in
your
unselfishness
my
generous
pity
for
the
man
that
has
ruined
your
she
interrupted
laying
her
hand
on
his
mouth
pains
me
so
terribly
when
you
speak
so
it
pity
geoffrey
it
is
far
far
he
did
not
contradict
her
in
her
words
he
looked
at
her
fondly
with
mingled
reverence
and
tenderness
but
she
did
not
feel
satisfied
that
he
quite
believed
her
are
the
whole
world
to
me
he
murmured
i
am
not
selfish
in
wishing
to
keep
you
all
to
myself
for
a
time
it
may
not
will
not
i
think
be
for
very
long
and
grant
i
may
have
strength
to
work
for
her
while
she
has
no
one
else
to
look
he
spoke
too
low
for
marion
who
had
moved
across
the
room
to
catch
his
words
when
she
had
got
her
work
she
came
back
and
sat
down
beside
him
is
frightfully
hard
upon
you
he
said
anxiously
no
comforts
no
anything
if
only
we
had
a
little
house
of
our
own
however
small
but
we
must
not
think
of
that
just
yet
in
a
few
months
i
hope
we
shall
get
the
two
thousand
pounds
which
is
all
we
shall
ever
see
of
the
old
bank
then
perhaps
we
might
think
of
furnishing
a
little
house
should
be
dreadfully
rich
then
said
marion
cheerfully
hundred
a
year
oh
yes
we
might
quite
furnish
a
house
then
and
keep
perhaps
two
furnishing
would
make
a
hole
in
the
capital
and
then
we
have
as
much
as
a
hundred
additional
said
geoffrey
dolefully
at
all
exclaimed
his
wife
are
forgetting
the
three
hundred
pounds
ready
money
we
have
already
it
is
with
that
or
part
of
it
i
intend
to
we
must
see
he
said
unwilling
to
damp
her
pleasure
in
these
plans
but
mentally
resolving
that
in
the
meantime
at
least
the
precious
three
hundred
must
not
be
trenched
upon
must
see
he
repeated
thing
i
am
thankful
for
and
that
is
there
can
be
no
more
question
of
your
doing
anything
but
take
care
of
yourself
no
more
trampings
to
or
still
more
horrible
omnibus
horrible
at
all
said
marion
brightly
am
really
very
sorry
it
is
over
they
are
dear
little
boys
and
allen
herself
is
the
best
and
kindest
creature
possible
and
as
for
sitting
at
home
and
taking
care
of
myself
i
can
assure
you
i
have
no
idea
of
doing
anything
of
the
sort
i
have
lots
of
things
to
do
she
went
on
her
face
flushing
a
little
think
of
all
the
sewing
i
must
get
through
i
shall
spend
five
pounds
of
the
money
i
have
earned
in
materials
and
i
shall
make
everything
geoffrey
smiled
a
smile
more
piteous
than
tears
poor
darling
he
said
think
that
you
should
have
to
work
your
pretty
fingers
sore
i
am
afraid
i
feel
very
amiably
inclined
to
the
are
very
wicked
said
marion
laughing
in
spite
of
herself
am
not
indeed
he
pleaded
can
i
feel
amiably
disposed
to
anything
that
will
cause
you
so
much
trouble
but
i
say
it
if
it
vexes
you
i
dare
say
you
think
me
horribly
unnatural
but
how
can
i
care
for
anything
as
i
do
for
you
mind
she
replied
care
quite
enough
when
the
time
comes
and
i
never
said
i
was
going
to
work
my
fingers
sore
you
exaggerating
then
she
brought
out
the
five
pound
note
she
had
that
day
received
from
allen
and
set
to
work
to
calculate
how
far
was
the
farthest
to
which
the
hundred
shillings
could
be
persuaded
to
extend
themselves
in
her
contemplated
purchases
millington
experience
was
applied
to
as
a
competent
authority
on
the
probable
prices
of
various
materials
but
to
tell
the
truth
though
he
gave
his
most
solemn
attention
to
the
subject
under
consideration
he
failed
to
distinguish
himself
as
might
have
been
expected
and
ended
by
getting
himself
called
great
stupid
who
know
the
difference
between
linen
and
cotton
valenciennes
and
it
was
laughable
enough
in
its
way
this
little
domestic
scene
i
dare
say
but
pathetic
too
marion
through
all
her
cheerfulness
was
yet
conscious
of
the
peculiar
loneliness
of
her
position
motherless
sisterless
her
only
confidante
in
these
essentially
womanly
matters
a
man
whom
at
first
sight
one
would
hardly
have
selected
as
likely
to
excel
in
delicate
adaptation
of
his
strength
to
her
weakness
his
thorough
manliness
to
her
shrinking
refinement
yet
great
rough
ploughman
as
he
called
himself
few
men
were
better
fitted
than
geoffrey
baldwin
to
be
mother
sister
and
friend
as
well
as
husband
to
the
solitary
girl
who
had
no
one
but
him
to
look
to
christmas
brought
a
letter
from
harry
enclosing
a
cheque
for
ten
pounds
buy
marion
a
winter
bonnet
he
said
since
the
news
of
their
misfortune
had
reached
him
conduct
had
been
beyond
all
praise
not
only
had
he
at
once
cut
down
his
already
moderate
personal
expenses
but
by
the
strictest
economy
he
had
succeeded
in
saving
the
little
surplus
he
now
sent
to
his
sister
as
a
how
welcome
a
one
he
little
guessed
for
it
was
of
course
at
once
appropriated
to
be
spent
in
the
same
direction
as
the
obstinate
five
pounds
which
so
to
behave
themselves
as
ten
be
unhappy
about
me
wrote
brother
only
wish
i
could
see
that
you
and
baldwin
are
as
jolly
as
i
my
pay
is
as
you
see
more
than
enough
for
my
expenses
and
if
all
goes
well
by
the
time
we
come
home
again
i
have
a
very
good
chance
of
being
made
adjutant
which
will
enable
me
to
manage
without
difficulty
in
england
by
another
christmas
i
shall
hope
to
be
with
you
at
home
millington
or
anywhere
it
you
two
are
is
home
to
some
tears
were
shed
over
this
letter
it
was
not
in
it
should
be
otherwise
nevertheless
it
added
not
a
little
to
the
cheerfulness
of
two
lodgers
as
they
ate
their
modest
christmas
dinner
in
the
looking
into
brewer
street
a
ponderous
invitation
to
perform
that
same
important
ceremony
in
the
presence
and
at
the
board
of
and
baxter
had
been
received
but
civilly
declined
us
have
a
nice
quiet
together
in
our
own
little
room
pleaded
marion
and
geoffrey
was
by
no
means
loth
to
comply
with
the
request
christmas
past
the
new
year
soon
began
january
february
and
march
three
ugly
dirty
slushy
months
in
millington
at
least
followed
each
other
in
gloomy
succession
with
april
things
began
to
mend
a
little
fresh
sprouts
made
their
appearance
with
infinite
labour
and
patience
even
on
the
few
shrubs
and
trees
in
brewer
street
and
at
no
there
was
comfort
and
content
for
baldwin
had
been
far
from
idle
these
last
few
months
and
surveyed
with
no
small
satisfaction
the
piles
of
little
garments
which
bore
witness
to
her
industry
then
came
may
sweet
fickle
provoking
may
mois
de
marie
which
still
we
dream
of
as
loveliest
of
all
the
twelve
though
seldom
if
ever
are
our
fond
visions
realised
but
this
year
may
was
for
once
true
to
her
legendary
character
and
the
end
of
the
month
was
fresh
and
sweet
and
genial
as
we
all
fancy
may
used
to
be
long
ago
when
we
were
children
in
the
times
when
christmas
was
always
clear
and
frosty
seen
through
a
brilliant
vista
of
holly
and
mistletoe
and
and
a
suitable
fairy
carnival
of
sunshine
and
flowers
dances
on
the
green
or
picnics
in
the
wood
what
has
come
over
the
world
in
these
later
days
why
is
christmas
as
often
as
not
muddy
and
foggy
and
raw
ending
in
uneatable
or
deplorably
indigestible
is
it
in
us
or
in
it
this
extraordinary
change
where
have
they
all
gone
beautiful
winters
and
summers
of
long
ago
the
lovely
hot
sunny
days
when
the
nights
seemed
years
apart
and
the
deep
green
woods
the
proper
place
to
live
we
made
and
and
all
manner
of
sweet
silly
summer
things
whose
very
names
now
sound
as
the
dreams
of
a
former
existence
the
spring
with
its
blossoms
the
autumn
with
its
fruit
the
bright
sparkling
winter
with
its
and
skates
roast
chestnuts
and
games
surely
the
most
delightful
of
all
what
has
come
over
them
all
all
the
year
round
with
few
if
any
exceptions
the
days
have
a
uniform
shade
of
grey
with
the
exception
of
certain
physical
sensations
certain
practical
and
not
unwelcome
suggestions
from
the
housemaid
to
the
effect
that
is
getting
time
to
begin
fires
again
many
a
week
would
go
by
without
my
thinking
of
or
realising
the
change
of
the
seasons
then
again
some
trifle
will
bring
it
all
back
to
first
head
peeping
through
the
soil
a
cluster
of
red
berries
on
the
hedge
some
early
autumn
day
the
voices
passing
my
door
intent
on
a
summer
ramble
as
beautiful
to
them
i
suppose
as
it
once
was
to
me
or
more
tender
still
the
sweet
quaint
words
of
the
christmas
carols
in
the
village
any
of
these
the
old
wonderful
feeling
surges
over
me
to
overwhelming
and
i
ask
myself
if
indeed
my
youth
is
gone
for
ever
or
but
veiled
for
a
time
to
be
found
again
with
all
the
beauty
and
truth
the
essentially
everlasting
in
the
land
we
must
all
believe
in
or
cease
to
exist
but
i
have
wandered
from
brewer
street
and
what
happened
there
one
sunday
morning
a
bright
lovely
may
morning
the
last
day
but
one
of
the
capricious
month
a
daughter
was
born
to
the
young
couple
with
whom
fortune
had
played
such
malicious
tricks
a
sweet
tiny
soft
doll
of
a
thing
truly
the
very
nicest
of
babies
healthy
as
heart
could
wish
comfortable
and
content
real
sunday
child
is
she
not
said
marion
to
geoffrey
as
with
tremendous
precaution
and
solemnity
he
bent
down
to
kiss
the
funny
pink
nose
emerging
from
the
nest
of
flannel
by
her
side
nice
good
happy
sunday
child
i
am
very
glad
she
is
not
a
boy
a
girl
will
be
far
more
of
a
comfort
to
us
she
geoffrey
and
may
i
call
her
course
you
may
my
darling
he
replied
any
name
you
he
would
not
have
objected
to
or
borealis
as
a
small
friend
of
mine
once
suggested
at
a
family
consultation
of
the
kind
he
was
perfectly
satisfied
with
the
baby
whatever
its
sex
or
name
seeing
that
its
mother
the
light
of
his
eyes
the
being
for
whose
happiness
he
was
willing
nay
ready
at
any
moment
to
die
was
well
and
strong
and
pronounced
by
the
authorities
to
be
in
a
fair
way
towards
a
speedy
and
prosperous
recovery
chapter
xi
dream
the
dawning
and
the
day
the
wind
fell
and
the
thunder
ceased
the
rod
light
came
up
from
the
east
as
my
dear
love
lay
between
the
dawning
and
the
ballad
the
night
after
the
birth
marion
baldwin
had
a
somewhat
remarkable
dream
remarkable
in
more
ways
than
one
in
the
first
place
it
was
unusually
coherent
and
clear
in
the
second
it
was
the
first
and
only
time
in
which
ralph
severn
the
being
who
had
exerted
the
greatest
influence
on
herself
and
her
life
ever
appeared
to
her
in
vision
of
the
night
in
the
third
place
after
events
satisfied
her
at
least
that
to
some
extent
the
dream
was
prophetic
as
well
as
retrospective
she
dreamt
that
she
was
again
a
little
child
a
girl
with
flying
curls
and
nimble
feet
playing
with
her
brother
harry
in
the
garden
of
the
little
cottage
at
brackley
all
that
had
happened
to
her
since
eventful
girlhood
her
sufferings
and
joys
her
wifehood
had
hardly
as
yet
realized
whole
life
in
short
was
for
the
time
being
swept
out
of
her
mind
she
was
again
little
may
vere
chasing
butterflies
and
running
races
on
the
grass
with
still
smaller
harry
suddenly
in
the
midst
of
their
play
there
was
wafted
towards
her
a
strong
sweet
scent
it
was
that
of
honeysuckle
the
scent
which
ever
since
the
meeting
in
the
old
garden
at
the
peacock
she
had
not
been
able
to
endure
any
day
she
would
gladly
have
walked
some
miles
rather
than
encounter
it
in
her
dream
it
acted
upon
her
in
a
peculiar
bewildering
way
for
a
short
time
there
came
over
her
the
painful
sensation
of
partial
suffocation
it
seemed
to
her
that
she
stopped
in
her
running
and
lay
down
on
the
soft
velvety
grass
at
this
point
harry
disappeared
nor
did
the
remembrance
of
him
return
to
her
again
throughout
the
dream
gradually
the
oppression
cleared
away
and
her
breathing
became
easy
she
was
still
conscious
of
the
honeysuckle
scent
but
no
longer
to
a
painful
of
disagreeable
extent
then
some
one
called
her
by
name
clearly
and
distinctly
she
knew
the
voice
to
be
but
looking
up
eagerly
to
see
him
to
her
amazement
she
recognized
the
person
approaching
her
as
geoffrey
as
he
drew
nearer
she
saw
that
he
looked
pale
and
tired
and
walked
very
slowly
something
too
he
was
carrying
in
his
arms
the
form
of
which
she
could
not
at
first
distinguish
then
she
saw
that
it
was
a
little
child
lying
across
his
breast
as
if
asleep
it
was
not
a
baby
for
a
shower
of
thick
dark
hair
fell
over
and
concealed
the
face
and
as
geoffrey
came
close
to
her
and
stood
half
fainting
beside
her
with
one
hand
he
gently
put
aside
the
hair
and
she
saw
that
the
child
was
sybil
then
he
spoke
me
to
carry
her
marion
he
said
promised
to
take
care
of
her
and
see
her
safe
home
but
she
was
too
tired
to
walk
any
further
and
i
am
nearly
worn
out
marion
stretched
out
her
arm
to
take
the
child
but
suddenly
as
she
did
so
sybil
seemed
to
awake
slid
from
her
grasp
and
stood
before
her
without
speaking
the
child
for
a
moment
gazed
at
the
husband
and
wife
with
yearning
love
in
her
face
then
kissing
her
little
hands
she
turned
from
them
and
hastened
rapidly
away
seeming
rather
to
fly
than
run
but
ever
as
she
went
turning
to
kiss
her
hands
with
a
sort
of
beckoning
gesture
marion
did
not
feel
the
least
surprise
but
looking
at
geoffrey
was
amazed
to
see
him
in
violent
distress
must
go
he
cried
must
as
these
words
reached
her
ears
she
was
seized
with
that
fearful
indescribable
sensation
of
dream
horror
combining
in
itself
every
shade
of
human
agony
throwing
up
her
arms
in
her
extremity
she
heard
again
voice
calling
her
by
name
and
immediately
she
felt
her
hands
grasped
in
his
looking
up
she
met
his
tender
loving
gaze
fixed
on
her
marion
he
cried
as
if
in
reproach
did
you
not
tell
me
before
why
did
you
leave
it
for
sybil
to
tell
see
only
how
geoffrey
is
suffering
could
you
not
have
trusted
my
great
love
not
even
for
his
sake
then
blinding
tears
fell
from
her
eyes
in
a
mist
as
it
were
she
saw
ralph
dart
forward
in
time
barely
to
prevent
falling
to
the
ground
the
sense
of
suffocation
again
oppressed
her
and
making
a
strong
effort
to
overcome
it
she
woke
with
a
slight
scream
to
find
geoffrey
bending
over
her
in
some
anxiety
for
her
sleep
had
been
disturbed
and
he
had
obtained
the
permission
to
watch
beside
her
while
that
good
lady
was
occupied
in
performing
miss
toilette
for
the
day
it
was
early
morning
there
were
birds
a
few
at
least
even
in
brewer
street
and
their
sweet
spring
chirping
sounded
fresh
and
bright
to
waking
ears
have
had
such
a
queer
dream
she
said
to
her
husband
and
she
looked
at
him
anxiously
are
quite
well
this
morning
dear
geoffrey
are
you
not
she
asked
have
not
been
sitting
up
all
night
beside
me
dear
no
he
answered
cheerfully
have
had
an
excellent
rest
but
now
i
must
be
off
for
the
old
dragon
in
the
next
room
made
me
promise
i
let
you
talk
first
thing
in
the
morning
before
you
have
had
anything
to
eat
i
shall
get
my
breakfast
and
start
for
town
be
back
for
an
hour
in
the
middle
of
the
day
to
see
how
getting
on
be
a
good
girl
and
get
well
as
fast
as
you
can
and
dream
queer
dreams
that
make
you
scream
in
your
a
disagreeable
dream
exactly
said
marion
i
quite
understand
geoffrey
smiled
at
the
grave
consideration
she
bestowed
on
the
subject
then
he
kissed
her
tenderly
and
was
gone
it
might
have
been
only
the
faint
light
in
the
room
but
somehow
marion
could
not
rid
herself
of
the
idea
that
geoffrey
did
not
look
well
that
morning
certainly
he
had
had
plenty
to
try
him
of
late
his
anxiety
about
her
had
of
itself
been
enough
to
knock
him
up
she
must
not
be
morbid
or
fanciful
she
said
to
herself
the
best
thing
she
could
do
for
her
husband
was
to
get
well
herself
as
quickly
as
possible
so
as
to
be
able
to
take
care
of
him
and
see
he
played
no
tricks
with
himself
in
the
way
of
not
changing
his
wet
clothes
going
too
long
without
food
or
any
nonsense
of
that
kind
she
did
her
best
to
keep
to
her
resolution
and
her
recovery
progressed
satisfactorily
the
baby
was
certainly
very
delightful
its
fingers
and
toes
especially
it
really
cried
very
little
indeed
hardly
at
all
with
a
many
said
the
nurse
and
marion
thought
it
a
round
ball
of
perfection
the
nicest
time
was
the
evening
when
geoffrey
came
and
sat
beside
her
his
work
over
and
she
made
him
hold
the
baby
in
his
arms
and
laughed
at
his
wonderful
clumsiness
till
the
tears
ran
down
her
cheeks
when
she
was
well
enough
to
be
carried
downstairs
and
established
on
the
regulation
sofa
which
by
the
help
of
a
few
pillows
geoffrey
had
succeeded
in
rendering
somewhat
more
comfortable
some
few
visitors
dropped
in
to
enquire
after
her
kind
allen
of
course
who
indeed
had
allowed
few
days
to
pass
since
baby
arrival
without
calling
herself
or
sending
a
servant
with
far
more
fruit
than
baldwin
could
possibly
have
consumed
and
flowers
in
sufficient
abundance
to
have
decked
the
greater
part
of
the
front
parlours
in
brewer
to
speak
of
more
substantial
proofs
of
friendliness
in
the
shape
of
jellies
and
blancmanges
and
a
dozen
of
old
port
surreptitiously
confided
to
care
for
the
use
of
the
young
mother
she
begins
to
get
about
it
was
all
done
so
simply
with
such
homely
kindliness
that
even
geoffrey
could
not
feel
offended
or
otherwise
than
grateful
for
the
motherly
goodness
which
his
young
gentleness
and
sweetness
had
thus
drawn
forth
the
baxter
chariot
made
its
appearance
in
brewer
street
one
day
and
the
descended
therefrom
in
person
to
inspect
the
new
thing
in
babies
which
had
made
its
appearance
at
no
she
condescended
to
approve
of
small
mary
handled
her
in
a
wonderfully
knowing
manner
and
altogether
her
mamma
by
the
astonishing
amount
of
monthly
nurse
talk
she
managed
to
get
through
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
in
this
domain
evidently
she
felt
herself
at
home
and
thorough
mistress
of
all
she
touched
upon
two
or
three
weeks
soon
passed
and
marion
began
to
resume
her
regular
habits
her
anxiety
about
geoffrey
though
it
had
to
some
extent
subsided
had
by
no
means
altogether
left
her
at
times
he
looked
almost
like
his
old
self
then
again
any
extra
fatigue
or
unusual
anxiety
would
tell
on
him
fearfully
one
day
when
he
left
for
town
he
told
her
not
to
expect
him
home
for
an
hour
later
than
usual
as
he
thought
it
probable
he
would
be
detained
till
that
time
it
was
a
fine
mild
evening
marion
opened
the
window
of
her
room
upstairs
from
whence
she
could
see
some
way
down
the
street
and
sat
there
watching
for
his
return
he
came
at
last
walking
slowly
and
looking
very
wearied
a
slight
shiver
crept
through
her
as
suddenly
the
remembrance
of
her
strange
dream
flashed
across
her
mind
she
darted
downstairs
and
met
him
at
the
door
then
drawing
him
gently
into
the
little
she
said
you
not
well
i
have
been
watching
you
coming
along
the
street
and
i
fancied
you
looked
so
pale
and
he
did
not
answer
her
immediately
he
sank
down
on
a
chair
and
covered
his
face
with
his
hand
she
grew
frightened
she
said
with
the
slight
petulance
of
nervous
anxiety
to
me
do
are
you
not
well
or
is
anything
the
matter
he
roused
himself
and
looked
up
in
a
bewildered
manner
be
vexed
with
me
dear
he
said
know
i
am
very
stupid
no
there
is
nothing
the
matter
i
am
quite
well
only
a
slight
feeling
of
giddiness
came
over
me
just
now
i
have
had
rather
an
extra
long
walk
and
it
is
getting
very
close
and
oppressive
in
the
warehouse
now
the
summer
is
coming
on
i
shall
be
all
right
after
tea
let
us
have
it
now
for
i
have
a
lot
of
things
to
talk
to
you
she
saw
he
was
very
tired
and
therefore
said
no
more
till
refreshed
by
the
meal
he
settled
himself
comfortably
in
an
by
the
window
delightful
it
must
be
in
the
country
just
now
said
geoffrey
will
be
looking
its
very
said
marion
a
little
sadly
am
not
happy
when
i
think
of
your
being
cooped
up
in
this
place
all
through
the
summer
geoffrey
i
can
see
it
does
not
suit
is
not
so
bad
for
me
as
for
you
he
replied
then
with
a
sudden
change
of
tone
do
you
think
i
went
after
leaving
the
office
i
set
off
to
call
on
your
friend
thank
her
for
all
her
kindness
exclaimed
marion
am
very
glad
it
is
just
what
i
have
been
wishing
you
would
do
but
i
like
to
propose
it
for
you
have
seemed
so
tired
lately
in
the
to
tell
the
truth
it
was
not
merely
to
thank
her
said
geoffrey
wanted
to
consult
her
about
you
i
am
not
quite
satisfied
that
you
are
getting
as
thoroughly
strong
again
as
you
should
and
one
day
the
doctor
said
something
about
being
always
desirable
after
this
sort
of
thing
i
get
it
out
of
my
head
so
at
last
i
went
to
consult
with
allen
as
to
how
it
should
be
managed
she
has
made
the
most
capital
arrangement
if
only
you
will
be
a
good
girl
and
agree
to
it
what
a
good
creature
allen
is
good
answered
marion
warmly
is
this
plan
of
hers
almost
afraid
to
tell
you
i
shall
be
so
horribly
disappointed
if
you
agree
to
it
said
geoffrey
the
allens
are
going
to
the
on
friday
for
a
month
and
she
has
asked
you
and
the
baby
and
nurse
of
course
to
go
with
them
for
a
leave
you
exclaimed
marion
in
dismay
for
a
fortnight
dear
he
replied
shall
get
on
very
well
possibly
i
may
get
away
on
and
stay
with
you
till
the
monday
refuse
to
go
my
darling
you
know
what
a
relief
it
will
be
to
my
mind
to
know
you
are
having
a
breath
of
fresh
you
want
it
more
than
i
do
my
poor
geoffrey
remonstrated
marion
her
voice
faltering
can
i
leave
you
here
alone
for
a
whole
fortnight
and
you
are
not
well
i
see
you
are
not
well
though
you
own
to
surely
it
would
not
mend
matters
for
you
not
to
try
to
get
stronger
now
you
have
really
a
chance
of
doing
so
he
urged
of
all
depending
on
little
monkey
too
supposing
i
were
to
fall
ill
which
heaven
forbid
so
long
as
i
am
any
good
to
you
my
dearest
all
the
more
reason
for
you
to
keep
there
was
reason
in
this
marion
could
not
deny
geoffrey
saw
she
was
beginning
to
yield
and
resolved
wisely
to
strike
while
the
iron
was
hot
promised
to
send
allen
a
line
by
post
he
said
briskly
me
my
portfolio
and
write
it
now
and
get
sarah
ann
or
whatever
her
name
is
to
post
it
i
am
so
glad
to
have
it
settled
you
are
a
very
good
girl
marion
and
he
kissed
her
fondly
me
you
get
ill
while
i
am
away
she
said
wistfully
course
i
talk
nonsense
he
replied
the
words
were
rough
but
the
tone
of
the
tenderest
he
went
on
think
i
am
a
bit
worse
than
i
was
last
year
when
we
first
came
here
it
is
only
the
close
weather
that
tries
and
his
satisfaction
at
the
successful
result
of
his
little
scheme
made
him
look
so
bright
and
cheerful
that
spirits
rose
again
and
she
began
to
think
her
fears
had
been
exaggerated
sure
you
write
every
day
were
her
last
words
on
the
friday
morning
when
for
the
first
time
since
their
coming
to
millington
the
husband
and
wife
separated
he
nodded
a
cheerful
assent
and
in
another
minute
the
train
puffed
out
of
the
station
and
poor
geoffrey
standing
solitary
on
the
platform
straining
his
eyes
to
catch
the
last
glimpse
of
his
wife
was
lost
to
sight
notwithstanding
her
misgivings
on
his
account
marion
could
not
but
feel
that
the
change
of
air
and
scene
was
very
acceptable
and
pleasant
the
allens
were
the
kindest
and
most
considerate
of
hosts
the
fresh
sea
air
seemed
to
give
her
new
life
and
strength
with
every
breath
little
mary
throve
as
a
sunday
child
should
and
everything
but
the
thought
of
loneliness
conspired
to
refresh
and
inspirit
her
for
the
first
week
every
morning
brought
a
few
words
from
brewer
street
he
was
on
all
right
wrote
geoffrey
delighted
to
hear
she
was
so
well
and
happy
and
looking
forward
if
all
were
well
to
a
saturday
and
sunday
together
by
the
sea
before
her
return
one
day
he
forwarded
to
her
a
letter
in
an
unfamiliar
hand
she
opened
it
with
some
curiosity
and
hastily
glanced
at
the
signature
it
was
that
of
jane
kind
of
her
to
write
thought
marion
and
the
contents
of
the
letter
pleased
her
very
much
have
not
been
able
to
write
before
wrote
maria
at
school
we
are
not
allowed
to
send
letters
to
any
one
not
a
relation
the
holidays
have
just
begun
and
i
want
very
much
to
tell
you
that
i
gave
your
message
to
lotty
severn
immediately
i
saw
her
she
was
so
very
glad
to
hear
about
you
she
asked
me
a
good
many
questions
and
i
hope
it
was
not
wrong
of
me
to
tell
her
what
i
know
that
you
were
married
i
mean
to
baldwin
and
how
handsome
and
kind
he
was
and
also
that
i
thought
you
had
lost
a
great
deal
of
money
i
hope
it
was
not
wrong
of
me
to
tell
that
i
heard
them
speaking
of
you
at
my
the
next
day
after
you
dined
there
and
i
was
not
sure
that
i
caught
your
name
rightly
for
i
think
uncle
baxter
said
your
name
used
to
be
vere
and
i
understood
you
to
say
freer
but
lotty
says
i
am
quite
right
and
that
before
you
were
married
and
at
the
time
they
knew
you
you
were
miss
freer
she
asked
me
to
give
you
her
love
if
ever
i
saw
you
and
to
tell
you
she
would
always
remember
you
and
she
hoped
baldwin
would
make
a
great
deal
of
money
at
millington
she
said
she
would
not
talk
about
you
to
any
one
but
her
to
her
grandmother
for
sybil
always
thought
lady
severn
was
unkind
to
you
lotty
her
uncle
loved
you
very
much
for
being
so
good
to
sybil
and
lotty
says
she
is
sure
he
will
like
to
hear
about
you
i
think
that
was
all
lotty
said
i
should
like
to
see
you
again
very
much
i
heard
you
had
a
little
baby
and
i
told
lotty
so
she
wished
you
would
call
it
i
am
afraid
i
shall
not
see
you
again
for
my
aunt
baxter
offended
my
mamma
the
last
time
we
were
there
and
mamma
says
she
will
never
go
there
again
and
so
the
simple
girlish
epistle
ended
but
it
please
marion
even
while
it
recalled
painful
associations
she
was
glad
to
have
been
able
to
send
a
message
to
poor
lotty
and
to
receive
this
assurance
of
the
little
affection
pleased
too
that
even
in
this
indirect
roundabout
way
some
tidings
of
her
should
penetrate
to
ralph
she
was
glad
that
he
should
know
that
her
strong
interest
in
his
little
nieces
had
in
no
wise
faded
that
sweet
sybil
had
not
been
unmourned
by
her
that
the
incident
should
lead
to
any
other
result
in
no
wise
occurred
to
her
it
was
on
the
thursday
morning
of
the
second
week
of
her
stay
with
the
allens
that
she
received
this
letter
the
day
but
one
to
bring
geoffrey
friday
passed
without
any
tidings
of
him
the
first
day
he
had
missed
writing
she
felt
a
little
uneasy
still
more
so
when
saturday
morning
brought
no
letter
but
allen
persuaded
her
that
as
he
was
coming
that
day
he
would
not
have
thought
it
necessary
to
write
might
not
improbably
have
been
detained
late
at
business
the
previous
evening
in
preparation
for
the
holiday
marion
felt
but
half
satisfied
but
tried
to
think
it
was
all
right
to
kill
time
till
the
hour
at
which
allen
promised
to
escort
her
to
the
station
to
meet
her
husband
she
went
a
long
walk
with
the
two
boys
she
did
her
best
to
be
cheerful
they
hunted
for
shells
they
built
sand
fortresses
for
the
waves
to
undermine
they
ran
races
on
the
shore
but
for
all
that
her
heart
was
heavy
with
unacknowledged
misgiving
at
last
they
turned
towards
home
a
few
paces
from
their
own
door
they
met
allen
hastening
towards
them
must
have
been
quite
a
long
walk
he
said
speaking
it
seemed
to
marion
rather
faster
than
usual
have
been
some
distance
in
the
other
direction
looking
for
you
what
a
lovely
day
it
is
he
went
on
hurriedly
the
day
for
the
baldwin
would
have
enjoyed
it
so
much
such
a
pity
he
come
repeated
marion
in
astonishment
is
coming
allen
i
had
no
letter
this
morning
and
he
would
have
been
sure
to
write
had
anything
prevented
his
she
glanced
at
face
he
did
not
speak
but
she
read
something
in
his
expression
which
caused
her
heart
for
an
instant
to
stand
still
and
then
again
to
beat
with
almost
suffocating
rapidity
allen
she
exclaimed
wildly
are
playing
with
me
it
is
nonsense
i
see
it
all
in
your
face
you
have
had
some
dreadful
news
while
i
was
out
you
have
had
a
letter
saying
good
god
tell
me
the
worst
give
me
the
letter
if
you
a
letter
stammered
allen
his
rosy
face
suffused
with
perspiration
drawn
forth
by
his
very
unsuccessful
attempt
at
it
gently
to
the
poor
a
letter
a
telegram
from
baxter
and
yes
you
shall
see
it
he
went
on
fumbling
in
his
pocket
for
the
large
thin
envelope
with
the
fatal
in
the
corner
i
sake
excite
so
my
dear
young
lady
think
of
the
poor
he
was
a
family
man
you
see
and
none
of
the
little
allens
had
been
brought
up
all
it
may
not
be
so
bad
as
you
she
seized
the
envelope
tore
out
the
paper
it
enclosed
and
devoured
the
words
with
hungry
eyes
from
robert
baxter
millington
to
allen
thus
ran
the
telegram
seen
baldwin
two
days
sent
to
enquire
find
him
very
ill
better
send
his
wife
at
that
was
all
all
that
could
be
learnt
for
the
next
dreadful
three
hours
which
must
elapse
before
the
poor
wife
could
be
by
the
bedside
of
her
suffering
perhaps
dying
husband
for
good
allen
read
and
after
a
waking
nightmare
of
hurry
and
confusion
marion
found
herself
but
half
conscious
of
where
she
was
or
what
she
was
doing
in
the
railway
hastening
back
to
the
home
she
had
quitted
so
unwillingly
but
a
few
days
before
baby
mary
was
with
her
of
course
torn
from
her
cot
poor
child
to
be
hastily
enveloped
in
hood
and
cloak
and
hurried
away
on
this
unexpected
journey
but
it
was
all
one
to
her
she
was
really
a
wonderful
baby
for
taking
things
coolly
and
reposed
poor
little
soul
in
calm
unconsciousness
of
her
danger
or
her
agonising
anxiety
so
bad
but
it
might
have
been
worse
quoted
allen
to
himself
would
really
have
been
dreadful
if
the
poor
baby
as
they
generally
do
had
seen
fit
to
scream
all
the
way
millington
dirty
smoky
unlovely
millington
at
last
a
wretched
jolting
drive
in
a
wretched
jolting
cab
with
a
stupid
driver
who
could
not
or
would
not
read
the
names
of
the
streets
or
the
numbers
of
the
houses
in
consequence
of
which
the
greater
part
of
the
transit
from
the
station
to
brewer
street
was
performed
by
allen
with
the
upper
half
of
his
stout
little
in
the
regulation
costume
of
scotch
tweed
which
he
had
not
had
time
to
out
of
the
cab
window
as
far
as
it
could
reach
in
the
direction
of
the
driver
ending
at
last
in
a
sudden
halt
at
door
careless
of
cab
fare
all
but
forgetful
of
baby
marion
dashed
open
the
little
garden
gate
and
flew
to
the
door
it
was
opened
before
she
had
time
to
ring
appleby
had
heard
them
stop
is
he
was
all
she
could
say
poorly
afraid
replied
the
but
even
that
was
better
than
the
worst
then
hastened
up
allen
and
leading
the
way
into
the
front
parlour
appleby
related
to
the
two
the
particulars
of
seizure
had
not
been
to
say
well
since
baldwin
left
said
appleby
up
to
thursday
however
he
had
been
able
to
go
to
business
as
usual
on
that
morning
he
had
not
got
up
told
appleby
his
head
was
so
bad
he
thought
he
must
stay
in
bed
he
seemed
to
sleep
most
of
that
day
and
the
landlady
was
in
hopes
by
friday
morning
he
would
be
all
right
again
but
it
was
not
so
she
felt
at
a
loss
what
to
do
and
proposed
to
him
to
send
for
the
doctor
or
baldwin
both
of
which
propositions
he
most
decidedly
negatived
this
morning
however
saturday
he
was
so
evidently
worse
appleby
fancied
that
she
grew
frightened
and
when
a
young
man
from
baxter
brothers
called
to
ask
if
baldwin
were
ill
she
sent
by
him
a
note
to
the
same
medical
man
who
had
attended
baldwin
and
a
request
to
some
of
the
gentlemen
at
the
office
to
telegraph
to
allen
at
sandbeach
the
doctor
been
yes
and
was
to
call
again
in
the
afternoon
will
wait
till
he
has
been
said
allen
decidedly
and
when
marion
began
to
make
some
piteous
apology
for
so
trespassing
on
his
kindness
dear
said
the
little
man
drawing
himself
up
to
his
full
height
of
five
feet
five
and
a
half
dear
do
you
take
me
for
a
monster
monster
he
repeated
human
form
no
no
as
sure
as
my
name
is
hallen
feel
towards
you
my
dear
as
a
daughter
in
this
time
of
trouble
now
run
away
to
your
poor
fellow
and
do
your
best
to
be
calm
i
shall
do
very
well
here
till
i
have
seen
this
good
lady
i
have
no
doubt
with
a
gallant
inclination
towards
appleby
which
forthwith
gained
the
worthy
heart
good
lady
will
get
me
a
chop
and
shall
still
have
time
to
catch
the
last
train
to
sandbeach
now
think
any
more
about
me
run
away
to
your
she
needed
no
second
bidding
but
alas
when
she
stood
by
bedside
laid
her
cool
hand
on
his
forehead
called
him
by
every
endearing
name
he
no
longer
knew
her
he
lay
in
a
sort
of
stupor
perfectly
quiet
not
apparently
suffering
his
eyes
were
open
but
for
her
sightless
he
stared
at
her
evidently
without
the
slightest
recognition
it
was
fearful
she
had
never
before
come
in
contact
with
this
sort
of
illness
rarely
indeed
with
serious
illness
of
any
kind
and
she
crouched
down
by
the
bedside
and
sobbed
her
very
heart
out
suddenly
she
fancied
she
heard
him
speak
he
was
only
muttering
to
himself
letter
he
said
must
put
it
where
she
will
be
sure
to
see
once
as
soon
as
ever
it
is
all
over
veronica
will
be
good
to
her
at
he
spoke
so
rationally
though
the
words
made
her
shudder
that
she
fancied
he
must
be
recovering
his
consciousness
dear
geoffrey
she
said
am
here
shall
i
fetch
the
letter
but
he
only
stared
at
her
vacantly
and
repeated
will
be
to
see
sure
to
see
it
when
all
is
then
he
dozed
off
again
and
for
an
hour
or
more
she
crouched
beside
him
in
her
desolation
of
misery
at
the
end
of
that
time
came
appleby
to
tell
her
that
hamley
was
below
and
to
entreat
her
to
take
some
nourishment
the
dear
sake
which
reminder
had
the
desired
effect
marion
could
not
succeed
in
obtaining
much
satisfaction
from
the
doctor
at
that
early
stage
in
an
illness
of
the
kind
he
said
to
her
it
was
impossible
to
give
an
opinion
no
doubt
it
was
likely
to
be
serious
but
baldwin
was
young
had
an
excellent
and
unimpaired
constitution
and
with
care
and
patience
they
had
every
reason
to
hope
the
best
she
must
take
great
care
of
herself
he
added
as
a
parting
every
sake
of
course
in
particular
yes
replied
marion
shall
see
how
reasonable
and
sensible
i
shall
be
hamley
if
only
you
will
let
me
nurse
him
unassisted
indeed
my
dear
young
lady
it
would
be
quite
out
of
the
question
said
the
doctor
a
short
time
you
really
must
have
a
nurse
it
is
a
case
in
which
everything
depends
on
constant
unflagging
care
and
watchfulness
i
shall
look
out
a
nice
nurse
myself
and
send
her
this
evening
you
very
much
faltered
poor
marion
as
he
left
her
promising
to
call
again
early
the
next
morning
to
allen
whom
he
saw
alone
on
his
way
out
hamley
was
much
more
and
explicit
is
terribly
ill
poor
fellow
he
said
will
be
at
best
a
case
you
see
it
has
been
coming
on
evidently
for
some
time
a
sort
of
break
up
it
is
in
fact
resulting
from
all
he
has
undergone
and
the
complete
change
in
his
life
and
habits
since
coming
here
if
he
recovers
a
return
to
a
country
life
will
be
his
only
chance
but
it
will
be
some
weeks
before
we
can
venture
to
talk
of
him
and
recovery
in
the
same
breath
i
only
hope
that
poor
strength
may
keep
thing
poor
thing
said
allen
sympathisingly
then
he
added
with
some
little
embarrassment
hamley
as
he
spoke
are
very
poor
doctor
and
illness
is
expensive
you
will
know
where
to
apply
to
if
there
is
any
difficulty
of
this
kind
i
must
hasten
to
catch
the
next
train
but
with
you
i
feel
that
i
leave
them
in
good
hands
you
will
see
that
they
want
for
nothing
that
a
little
ready
money
can
supply
right
my
dear
sir
replied
the
doctor
cordially
and
added
as
he
shook
hands
with
allen
are
fortunate
in
having
such
friends
as
i
know
of
old
your
worthy
lady
and
yourself
are
sure
to
prove
in
time
the
nurse
arrived
before
night
and
was
installed
in
her
place
then
began
the
weary
monotony
of
a
long
and
dangerous
illness
to
those
who
have
not
come
directly
in
contact
with
it
so
indescribable
to
those
who
have
themselves
watched
for
weeks
in
a
sick
room
so
painfully
familiar
it
proved
indeed
as
hamley
had
prophesied
a
close
race
between
me
and
death
for
many
days
none
could
have
said
which
was
the
more
likely
to
win
of
acute
suffering
there
was
little
for
the
occasional
paroxysms
of
fever
and
delirium
alternated
with
long
fits
of
stupor
during
which
for
hours
together
geoffrey
baldwin
neither
moved
nor
spoke
when
delirious
his
thoughts
appeared
chiefly
to
run
on
the
letter
to
which
he
had
alluded
in
the
beginning
of
his
illness
marion
got
accustomed
to
his
speaking
of
it
and
came
to
think
it
must
be
merely
a
dream
for
though
she
looked
in
every
direction
in
likely
and
unlikely
places
she
found
no
letter
to
which
his
broken
sentences
could
refer
she
soothed
or
tried
to
soothe
his
anxiety
on
the
subject
for
she
was
never
sure
if
she
understood
what
she
said
by
assuring
him
she
had
read
the
letter
and
would
attend
to
all
its
injunctions
all
is
over
he
asked
her
once
wistfully
gazing
in
her
face
but
not
even
to
satisfy
him
could
she
bring
herself
to
repeat
the
dreadful
when
all
is
all
through
the
weary
weeks
she
watched
him
as
if
with
the
concentrated
devotion
of
mother
sister
and
wife
she
did
not
allow
herself
to
think
had
she
done
so
her
strength
must
assuredly
have
failed
as
it
was
it
stood
the
test
in
a
way
that
astonished
all
about
her
do
not
know
how
wiry
i
am
she
said
one
day
to
hamley
and
she
judged
herself
correctly
at
last
at
june
had
grown
into
july
and
the
leaves
on
the
few
trees
in
brewer
street
were
already
poor
stunted
things
brown
and
shrivelled
by
millington
dust
and
smoke
and
seemingly
inclined
in
disgust
and
disappointment
to
drop
off
in
premature
last
after
the
long
waiting
the
heart
sickness
of
hope
deferred
till
it
had
all
but
become
despair
marion
had
her
reward
has
got
the
turn
my
dear
said
hamley
has
got
the
turn
and
if
we
can
now
keep
up
his
strength
and
spirits
we
shall
by
blessing
pull
him
chapter
xii
widow
law
holds
ever
good
that
nothing
comes
to
life
of
man
on
earth
unscathed
throughout
by
sophocles
she
had
thought
the
worst
over
but
it
hardly
proved
to
be
so
he
lay
indeed
peaceful
and
calm
her
own
geoffrey
again
restored
to
himself
in
mind
and
spirit
no
longer
tossed
by
the
anguish
of
delirium
or
deadened
by
unrefreshing
stupor
but
he
did
not
gain
strength
from
day
to
day
no
progress
was
made
hamley
was
nonplussed
seem
to
wish
to
get
better
he
said
to
marion
understand
it
i
have
tried
every
argument
to
rouse
him
but
he
only
says
he
is
perfectly
comfortable
and
begs
to
be
left
undisturbed
i
have
told
him
if
he
goes
on
like
this
he
will
never
get
well
but
he
seem
to
care
he
smiles
and
thanks
me
with
that
sweet
voice
of
his
till
i
feel
ready
to
shake
and
marion
at
last
began
to
lose
heart
one
was
growing
late
geoffrey
was
already
settled
for
the
sat
alone
in
the
little
parlour
very
weary
and
very
sad
when
her
glance
fell
on
her
old
bible
lying
on
the
side
table
it
was
the
one
they
had
always
used
at
family
prayers
in
the
days
when
they
were
the
centre
of
a
household
and
it
had
accompanied
them
to
millington
but
during
the
last
few
weeks
spent
principally
in
bedroom
it
had
not
been
opened
half
mechanically
now
marion
drew
it
towards
her
and
opened
it
at
one
of
her
favourite
chapters
some
few
verses
of
which
sweet
words
of
comfort
and
support
she
read
with
silent
but
not
the
less
fervent
appreciation
as
she
lifted
the
book
to
replace
it
a
letter
fell
out
she
started
and
shivered
as
the
superscription
met
her
eyes
be
read
by
my
widow
when
all
is
over
with
and
in
the
corner
the
initials
and
the
date
the
eve
of
the
day
on
which
geoffrey
had
been
taken
after
a
consideration
she
deliberately
broke
the
seal
drew
forth
and
read
the
paper
it
contained
it
was
letter
addressed
to
herself
and
ran
as
follows
dearest
wife
feel
that
i
am
going
to
be
very
ill
and
i
have
a
strong
belief
that
i
shall
not
recover
from
the
illness
which
is
coming
upon
me
i
have
felt
it
coming
on
for
some
time
but
i
had
hoped
to
keep
up
a
little
longer
till
i
had
been
able
to
make
better
arrangements
for
your
comfort
what
i
could
i
have
done
within
the
last
day
or
two
i
have
received
the
two
thousand
pounds
due
to
you
as
creditor
by
the
old
bank
i
have
made
it
over
to
the
care
of
framley
vere
he
will
i
trust
prove
a
better
trustee
than
i
did
my
poor
child
some
other
matters
i
have
also
explained
to
to
the
guardianship
of
our
little
daughter
i
have
also
for
some
time
past
had
a
promise
from
veronica
that
so
long
as
you
require
it
the
shelter
of
her
home
shall
be
open
to
you
i
think
you
will
be
happy
with
her
for
a
time
she
wishes
to
have
you
and
the
baby
with
her
very
much
but
it
is
not
so
much
about
these
matters
i
wish
to
write
to
you
it
is
about
yourself
my
own
darling
you
have
been
the
dearest
and
best
of
wives
to
me
you
pained
me
once
terribly
how
terribly
i
trust
you
may
never
know
but
it
was
not
your
fault
i
had
brought
it
on
myself
by
my
own
selfishness
my
headstrong
presumptuous
determination
to
have
you
for
my
own
at
all
costs
but
that
pain
is
past
your
devotion
to
me
of
late
has
more
than
effaced
what
indeed
i
never
blamed
you
for
i
think
god
that
i
am
not
to
be
a
burden
to
you
generous
unselfish
woman
that
you
are
for
my
dearest
you
must
not
from
any
mistaken
regard
to
my
memory
any
morbid
wish
to
atone
for
the
pain
you
could
not
help
once
causing
me
refrain
from
accepting
the
happiness
which
sooner
or
later
will
i
feel
sure
be
yours
to
take
or
refuse
his
name
i
do
not
know
i
know
indeed
nothing
but
what
you
yourself
told
me
i
have
never
sought
to
know
more
but
long
ago
you
told
me
he
was
good
and
noble
otherwise
indeed
how
could
one
so
pure
and
sweet
as
you
have
given
him
your
heart
i
gathered
too
that
he
was
rich
and
of
good
position
socially
so
there
will
be
no
outward
difficulties
in
the
way
i
have
too
an
instinctive
belief
that
he
has
been
constant
to
you
once
indeed
you
said
as
much
yourself
to
me
quite
lately
some
words
of
yours
dropped
half
think
it
was
the
day
we
dined
at
the
you
were
sitting
by
the
fire
late
that
evening
on
our
return
and
you
did
not
know
i
was
in
the
me
to
understand
that
he
had
not
married
any
one
else
i
am
getting
so
tired
i
can
hardly
hold
my
pen
i
had
meant
to
say
a
great
deal
more
but
i
can
sum
it
up
in
a
few
words
show
that
you
forgive
me
dearest
for
the
cloud
i
have
brought
over
your
life
by
being
happy
in
the
future
as
but
for
me
you
would
have
been
long
before
this
for
your
goodness
to
me
your
great
and
tender
pity
the
devotion
all
the
more
wonderful
because
of
its
utter
all
you
have
given
me
all
you
have
been
to
me
for
so
much
affection
as
you
could
give
me
i
would
thank
you
if
i
had
words
to
do
so
i
can
not
express
half
i
feel
my
own
love
my
darling
i
am
not
sorry
to
die
young
for
my
dearest
there
was
one
thing
you
could
not
give
me
and
without
it
i
own
to
you
the
thought
of
years
of
fruitless
longing
on
my
side
of
almost
superhuman
effort
on
yours
to
make
up
for
what
could
not
be
made
up
for
is
less
attractive
to
me
than
that
of
death
you
will
always
i
know
think
tenderly
of
me
when
all
is
over
with
me
no
bitterness
will
mingle
with
your
remembrance
of
me
most
devotedly
she
read
every
word
of
it
without
moving
when
she
had
finished
it
she
folded
it
reverentially
and
replaced
it
in
the
envelope
then
she
sank
on
the
ground
beside
the
chair
on
which
she
had
been
sitting
and
hiding
her
face
in
her
hands
knelt
there
in
perfect
silence
for
a
long
time
the
night
was
far
advanced
when
at
length
she
crept
upstairs
to
her
room
by
the
faint
she
saw
that
he
was
lying
perfectly
still
his
eyes
closed
she
thought
he
was
asleep
in
a
few
minutes
he
moved
slightly
he
said
that
you
she
answered
softly
thought
you
were
it
not
very
late
for
you
to
be
up
he
asked
keep
you
but
i
want
to
say
one
thing
to
you
which
has
been
troubling
me
when
i
was
at
the
worst
marion
delirious
i
mean
did
i
not
speak
about
a
letter
it
was
one
i
wrote
the
night
before
i
was
taken
ill
and
i
can
not
remember
where
i
put
it
i
should
not
like
it
to
be
lost
and
yet
i
am
afraid
it
would
vex
you
startle
you
if
you
found
it
just
now
if
only
i
could
get
up
and
look
for
it
need
not
wish
that
geoffrey
she
said
in
a
very
low
voice
have
found
the
letter
it
slipped
out
of
your
big
bible
that
lies
on
the
table
he
started
have
found
it
he
repeated
found
it
blame
me
have
read
he
asked
very
evening
an
hour
or
two
there
was
a
dead
silence
for
some
minutes
then
the
wife
bent
over
her
husband
she
wound
her
arms
round
his
neck
she
buried
her
face
in
his
breast
so
that
he
could
not
see
the
tears
that
rushed
at
last
to
her
eyes
could
scarcely
hear
the
words
the
pleading
earnest
words
that
rose
to
her
lips
she
said
own
geoffrey
i
have
read
the
letter
it
is
generous
and
beautiful
and
unselfish
it
is
like
you
but
for
all
that
you
see
you
feel
geoffrey
it
is
all
a
mistake
she
replied
mistake
it
was
all
true
that
i
told
you
of
course
true
that
i
loved
that
other
with
a
passionate
first
love
and
i
suffered
fearfully
that
after
we
were
married
geoffrey
before
i
had
learnt
to
know
i
met
him
and
the
sight
of
his
face
the
sound
of
his
voice
most
of
all
my
agony
of
pity
for
his
terrible
sorrow
revived
it
all
for
the
time
not
merely
for
the
time
in
one
sense
for
i
shall
always
honour
and
care
for
him
love
him
even
with
the
sort
of
tender
reverential
love
we
give
to
the
dead
but
it
is
all
different
from
now
that
love
is
softened
and
sacred
and
as
that
is
the
only
way
i
can
say
if
he
had
long
been
dead
but
you
geoffrey
you
are
my
own
dear
living
husband
the
father
of
my
little
child
the
dear
geoffrey
that
has
suffered
so
and
been
so
brave
and
patient
you
need
me
geoffrey
i
belong
to
you
as
i
never
did
to
him
and
i
need
you
we
have
grown
into
each
lives
and
beings
and
we
be
separated
if
you
die
and
leave
me
i
stay
behind
not
even
for
baby
oh
say
you
die
say
you
want
to
leave
to
leave
you
he
repeated
in
a
broken
voice
darling
my
darling
if
this
wonderful
thing
you
tell
me
is
true
how
could
i
ever
want
to
leave
you
how
can
i
ever
find
words
to
tell
you
the
wonderful
perfection
of
happiness
you
have
brought
me
but
is
it
true
you
would
not
you
could
not
deceive
me
marion
lying
here
till
five
minutes
ago
believing
myself
a
dying
man
before
god
tell
me
marion
my
wife
it
is
not
out
of
pity
you
have
spoken
thus
to
out
of
pity
you
have
told
me
that
you
love
me
he
raised
her
head
so
that
he
could
see
the
expression
of
her
face
the
truth
and
earnestness
in
her
clear
deep
eyes
is
true
geoffrey
she
said
solemnly
is
thoroughly
and
utterly
true
no
pity
could
have
made
me
say
what
i
have
said
just
now
it
is
no
new
thing
this
love
of
mine
for
you
long
long
ago
i
felt
it
growing
quietly
and
steadily
and
firmly
only
then
i
thought
it
had
come
too
late
my
worst
sufferings
at
the
manor
farm
were
when
i
thought
he
said
no
more
he
was
perfectly
satisfied
he
kissed
her
brow
her
mouth
her
eyes
as
if
to
seal
the
blessedness
of
his
new
found
joy
then
he
lay
back
and
closed
his
eyes
for
he
was
weak
still
weak
almost
as
an
infant
and
the
sun
when
it
rose
that
morning
above
the
smoke
and
heavy
dusty
air
surrounding
the
great
city
might
have
seen
one
pleasant
sight
the
sweet
sleeping
face
of
geoffrey
baldwin
a
man
to
whom
after
bitter
disappointment
and
sore
trouble
manfully
met
and
patiently
borne
god
in
his
goodness
had
sent
new
life
and
little
happiness
from
this
time
forth
as
might
have
been
expected
geoffrey
made
steady
progress
towards
recovery
it
was
still
of
course
but
slow
work
there
were
days
on
which
both
he
and
marion
felt
sadly
disheartened
but
hamley
kept
up
their
spirits
by
assuring
them
that
all
was
going
on
well
as
well
that
is
to
say
as
could
be
expected
after
so
serious
so
nearly
fatal
an
illness
and
at
last
they
grew
satisfied
that
his
opinion
was
correct
for
by
the
end
of
august
geoffrey
was
going
about
again
and
beginning
to
speak
of
ere
long
resuming
his
daily
duties
for
thanks
to
the
representations
of
that
monster
in
human
form
the
worthy
allen
situation
in
the
of
baxter
had
been
kept
open
for
him
but
there
was
a
great
hole
made
in
the
three
hundred
pounds
of
ready
money
they
had
been
hoping
by
this
time
to
furnish
a
little
house
with
on
one
point
marion
was
resolute
before
geoffrey
should
to
allude
to
such
a
thing
as
going
back
to
business
he
must
have
a
little
change
of
air
to
which
he
offered
no
great
objection
provided
she
would
go
with
him
of
course
including
baby
mary
and
her
nurse
so
to
sandbeach
they
went
for
a
week
thereby
making
a
still
greater
hole
in
the
little
but
enjoying
themselves
amazingly
nevertheless
back
again
at
millington
there
was
no
help
for
it
geoffrey
must
no
longer
delay
presenting
himself
at
office
and
resuming
the
weary
of
his
uncongenial
duties
but
it
was
with
a
lighter
heart
than
ever
he
had
dared
to
hope
for
that
the
young
man
paced
the
long
stretch
of
dirty
pavement
which
in
the
last
fifteen
months
had
grown
so
familiar
to
him
marion
was
watching
anxiously
for
his
are
not
very
tired
geoffrey
she
asked
as
she
met
him
at
the
door
no
he
replied
cheerfully
got
on
very
well
and
i
did
eat
some
luncheon
marion
i
did
indeed
they
were
very
kind
and
cordial
to
me
down
there
old
baxter
and
the
rest
hoping
i
was
all
right
again
and
all
that
sort
of
later
in
the
evening
as
they
were
sitting
together
quietly
geoffrey
resting
on
the
sofa
he
suddenly
exclaimed
marion
i
heard
rather
a
queer
thing
last
week
while
we
were
at
sandbeach
it
appears
we
had
a
visitor
she
repeated
do
you
mean
not
a
visitor
exactly
he
come
to
this
house
but
somebody
a
gentleman
called
at
the
office
and
asked
if
i
was
there
they
told
him
of
my
illness
so
he
asked
to
see
old
baxter
and
made
particular
enquiries
about
me
how
long
i
had
been
ill
and
i
know
all
what
he
leave
his
name
at
least
if
he
did
baxter
tell
it
but
the
clerks
say
they
are
sure
he
was
what
they
call
a
scold
me
marion
i
not
talking
slang
i
should
never
have
heard
of
it
but
through
one
of
them
who
saw
him
come
in
and
overheard
my
name
old
baxter
was
uncommonly
civil
to
him
they
say
showed
him
out
himself
and
was
fearfully
obsequious
i
wish
the
sight
of
my
grand
friend
if
he
is
a
friend
of
mine
would
make
the
old
screw
raise
my
salary
i
know
but
there
no
chance
of
any
such
luck
i
shall
never
get
on
in
millington
i
fear
marion
i
understand
their
ways
i
can
keep
books
and
so
on
well
enough
had
to
do
with
farm
books
all
my
life
but
quite
a
different
sort
of
geoffrey
she
said
sympathisingly
it
will
never
do
for
you
to
get
the
very
first
day
back
at
your
work
let
us
talk
of
something
else
who
can
this
gentleman
have
been
what
was
he
like
tall
they
said
answered
her
husband
the
middle
size
and
slight
not
but
gentlemanlike
very
dark
and
black
hair
rather
grey
for
his
age
for
they
say
he
look
much
over
thirty
i
can
think
of
no
one
i
know
answering
this
description
who
would
be
likely
to
be
enquiring
after
me
can
you
know
said
marion
rather
dreamily
but
any
one
more
observant
than
geoffrey
would
have
thought
that
for
a
woman
she
manifested
singularly
little
curiosity
about
the
mysterious
unknown
hair
rather
grey
for
his
age
she
murmured
softly
to
herself
more
than
once
that
evening
had
not
a
thread
of
silver
when
i
knew
a
week
later
came
one
morning
a
letter
for
geoffrey
which
arriving
after
he
had
left
for
business
excited
not
a
little
curiosity
during
the
day
it
was
addressed
in
a
somewhat
stiff
hand
and
its
postmark
was
mallingford
she
had
more
than
half
a
mind
to
open
it
fearful
of
the
effect
of
possible
bad
news
coming
suddenly
on
her
husband
but
ended
by
not
doing
so
afterwards
she
was
very
glad
she
had
left
it
for
geoffrey
to
read
first
himself
it
was
from
old
squire
copley
containing
a
formal
offer
to
baldwin
from
lord
brackley
of
his
brentshire
agency
unexpectedly
made
vacant
by
the
death
of
the
last
holder
some
six
weeks
before
need
hardly
my
dear
fellow
wrote
the
squire
your
acceptance
of
this
offer
it
is
a
capital
good
thing
of
its
kind
the
income
one
way
and
another
very
little
short
of
a
thousand
a
year
inclusive
of
course
of
the
house
a
sweet
pretty
place
for
a
young
couple
as
one
would
wish
to
see
brackley
has
been
down
here
himself
for
a
week
or
two
looking
into
things
a
bit
and
when
he
told
me
you
had
been
recommended
to
him
for
the
post
and
that
he
was
entertaining
the
idea
i
was
as
pleased
i
assure
you
as
if
you
had
been
a
son
of
my
own
very
man
for
the
place
said
i
and
so
say
one
and
all
hereabouts
my
boy
lady
anne
and
in
india
you
be
only
too
delighted
to
welcome
you
and
your
wife
and
the
little
one
i
heard
of
if
not
mistaken
back
to
your
old
neighbourhood
and
not
afraid
that
you
will
break
your
hearts
at
having
to
leave
millington
for
brentshire
born
and
bred
and
so
in
a
sense
is
your
then
followed
a
little
local
gossip
to
which
however
it
was
hardly
to
be
expected
that
geoffrey
or
his
wife
could
at
this
moment
pay
much
attention
they
looked
at
each
other
with
tears
in
their
eyes
but
sunshine
in
their
hearts
geoffrey
how
thankful
i
am
she
exclaimed
you
will
have
a
chance
of
getting
like
your
old
self
again
now
i
need
not
feel
anxious
about
you
any
more
how
happy
how
very
happy
we
shall
darling
he
replied
drawing
her
towards
him
you
really
be
happy
in
a
pretty
country
home
of
your
own
with
a
stupid
old
ploughman
like
me
squire
copley
is
right
it
is
a
dear
little
place
the
house
where
we
shall
live
much
prettier
than
the
manor
farm
though
not
so
large
but
i
am
not
sorry
to
begin
our
new
life
in
a
new
house
you
had
plenty
of
sorrow
in
the
old
one
my
dearest
heaven
grant
you
may
have
little
in
your
new
home
none
at
least
of
my
only
think
how
delightful
it
will
be
to
have
a
garden
for
mary
to
play
in
when
she
begins
to
toddle
about
by
herself
exclaimed
marion
a
home
to
welcome
poor
harry
to
at
christmas
added
geoffrey
truly
there
were
few
if
any
happier
people
that
night
in
the
world
than
two
young
lodgers
late
in
october
that
year
there
came
a
sort
of
indian
summer
a
week
or
two
of
inexpressible
beauty
tinged
with
a
certain
mellow
tenderness
a
sort
of
pensive
echo
of
the
summer
glories
past
and
gone
peculiar
to
this
lovely
de
saint
martin
of
which
we
so
seldom
see
anything
in
our
part
of
the
world
it
was
just
at
this
time
that
the
baldwins
after
a
week
or
two
spent
at
mallingford
with
veronica
temple
took
up
their
quarters
in
their
new
home
a
pretty
cosy
nest
of
a
place
as
it
was
it
could
hardly
have
been
seen
to
greater
advantage
than
on
the
day
on
which
marion
first
entered
it
as
its
mistress
are
pleased
with
it
dear
asked
geoffrey
and
the
look
with
which
she
answered
him
said
far
more
than
words
have
been
rather
puzzled
by
something
i
heard
to
day
geoffrey
went
on
after
a
pause
was
speaking
to
our
clergyman
brace
you
know
whom
i
happened
to
meet
in
the
village
he
was
congratulating
me
on
our
return
he
said
to
me
is
the
very
thing
for
you
baldwin
sir
ralph
severn
could
not
have
given
you
a
better
proof
of
his
friendship
than
by
recommending
you
to
his
uncle
for
the
i
felt
exceedingly
amazed
at
this
marion
but
i
said
nothing
to
bruce
i
thought
i
would
first
tell
you
about
it
is
it
not
strange
that
sir
ralph
severn
whom
to
my
knowledge
i
have
seen
in
my
life
whom
i
hardly
know
by
name
should
have
recommended
me
to
lord
brackley
and
it
must
be
the
case
for
bruce
evidently
had
heard
it
from
lord
brackley
and
i
know
he
is
not
the
sort
of
man
to
mention
a
thing
without
foundation
is
it
not
very
strange
surely
there
can
have
been
no
mistake
about
it
and
poor
geoffrey
looked
perplexed
and
distressed
heart
beat
a
little
faster
but
she
felt
that
the
right
time
had
come
dear
geoffrey
she
said
gently
is
no
mistake
i
have
suspected
this
before
i
guessed
who
the
stranger
was
that
called
at
and
enquired
all
about
you
and
your
circumstances
i
recognized
him
from
what
you
told
me
of
his
personal
appearance
it
was
he
that
got
you
lord
offer
you
know
now
geoffrey
you
guess
who
sir
ralph
severn
is
and
why
he
did
this
for
a
moment
geoffrey
sat
silent
still
with
the
look
of
bewilderment
and
anxiety
then
a
sudden
light
broke
over
his
face
he
said
i
see
i
see
it
all
and
from
the
bottom
of
my
heart
i
thank
him
for
his
goodness
and
i
pray
god
to
bless
him
but
marion
my
dearest
my
own
darling
and
as
he
spoke
he
drew
her
towards
him
and
looked
with
the
tender
trust
of
happy
love
into
the
clear
sweet
eyes
that
met
his
gaze
could
and
noble
as
he
could
not
have
said
what
i
have
could
not
have
felt
as
i
do
but
for
the
remembrance
of
the
sweetest
hour
of
my
life
the
night
when
you
found
the
letter
and
told
me
my
darling
that
i
need
not
you
had
learnt
to
love
marion
hid
her
face
in
her
breast
and
felt
that
she
was
at
rest
and
happy
but
tears
rose
gently
to
her
eyes
as
there
flashed
across
her
mind
the
remembrance
of
her
dream
i
look
from
my
are
you
still
so
fair
have
you
still
the
eyes
be
the
end
