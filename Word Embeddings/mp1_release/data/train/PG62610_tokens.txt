preface
i
do
not
expect
to
gain
fame
or
fortune
by
the
publication
of
this
little
book
i
have
prepared
it
for
publication
because
a
number
of
the
pioneers
who
read
my
journal
twenty
years
ago
when
published
in
have
asked
me
to
at
that
time
i
was
a
busy
wife
mother
and
housekeeper
and
could
only
write
when
my
baby
boy
was
taking
his
daily
nap
to
supply
the
copy
for
each
week
no
one
knows
better
than
i
how
very
imperfect
it
was
yet
many
seemed
to
enjoy
it
and
the
press
that
noticed
it
at
all
spoke
very
kindly
of
it
reminiscences
of
the
plains
by
howard
editor
through
your
kindness
to
howard
we
are
a
reader
of
your
excellent
journal
hence
a
few
months
ago
our
eyes
fell
upon
of
pilgrimage
across
the
plains
in
by
and
at
once
recognized
the
writer
as
the
who
rode
the
gallant
and
now
sir
as
we
were
an
humble
member
of
the
gallant
mcmahan
train
frequently
referred
to
in
her
interesting
journal
permit
me
through
the
columns
of
your
paper
to
tender
her
the
thanks
and
gratitude
not
only
of
ourselves
but
every
surviving
member
of
that
train
for
affording
us
the
pleasure
of
again
traveling
that
eventful
road
without
the
fatigue
and
hardships
of
a
long
and
tiresome
journey
and
even
now
after
the
lapse
of
fifteen
years
to
be
so
pleasantly
reminded
of
our
and
the
confidence
reposed
in
us
for
protection
while
passing
through
the
indian
country
we
almost
regret
that
the
savages
did
not
give
us
a
striking
opportunity
of
displaying
our
prowess
it
was
our
pleasure
to
form
the
acquaintance
of
the
writer
as
correctly
stated
on
the
north
bank
of
the
south
platte
near
the
foot
of
orchard
the
present
editor
of
the
then
a
beardless
youth
had
been
suffering
with
fever
from
the
time
we
left
nebraska
city
and
we
visited
her
camp
ostensibly
begging
bread
and
obtained
as
good
as
was
ever
baked
upon
the
plains
from
this
time
on
at
least
for
some
hundreds
of
miles
it
was
our
pleasure
to
meet
her
on
the
road
and
in
camp
we
were
in
different
trains
but
camped
near
each
other
every
night
for
protection
from
the
indians
very
soon
somehow
or
other
when
our
trains
were
preparing
to
drive
out
every
morning
and
miss
was
mounting
dick
we
were
in
the
act
of
mounting
our
pony
jo
and
even
at
this
day
in
thinking
over
the
matter
i
am
induced
to
believe
that
our
ponies
became
somewhat
attached
to
each
other
as
they
would
instinctively
fall
into
each
company
this
was
the
state
of
affairs
existing
at
elk
mountain
where
the
bouquet
was
gathered
and
presented
and
where
it
is
frankly
admitted
we
became
somewhat
partial
well
we
do
recollect
the
crossing
of
north
platte
that
turbulent
stream
on
the
fort
halleck
route
train
after
train
was
crossing
all
day
long
we
were
standing
on
the
bank
with
captain
mcmahan
when
the
hardinbrooke
train
the
one
in
which
she
was
traveling
approached
the
crossing
and
we
discovered
miss
raymond
on
the
front
seat
of
the
wagon
with
lines
in
hand
in
the
attitude
of
driving
we
remarked
gracious
look
yonder
is
it
possible
miss
raymond
is
going
to
drive
that
team
across
this
terrible
stream
alone
said
captain
mcmahan
the
time
to
show
your
and
before
we
could
think
twice
she
drove
bravely
in
of
course
we
mounted
jo
and
followed
after
her
and
here
on
a
little
island
in
the
middle
of
the
river
is
where
we
rode
up
and
congratulated
her
on
her
skill
as
a
driver
as
we
approached
the
place
of
our
destination
our
trains
became
separated
miss
preceded
us
a
few
days
to
the
golden
city
it
was
our
pleasure
however
to
visit
her
in
the
little
domicile
mentioned
in
her
narrative
and
talk
our
troubles
over
our
journey
through
at
last
and
in
her
happy
presence
we
forgot
the
gloomy
past
we
sojourned
in
virginia
city
but
a
short
time
then
crossed
a
tributary
of
the
missouri
near
their
confluence
and
wintered
at
diamond
city
confederate
gulch
the
june
following
we
returned
to
our
native
state
a
year
after
our
return
captain
mcmahan
and
myself
received
cards
announcing
the
nuptials
of
miss
raymond
and
herndon
which
cards
now
occupy
receivers
on
our
center
tables
for
which
we
were
ever
thankful
and
at
which
time
of
course
the
bouquet
crumbled
to
dust
and
now
wishing
the
who
rode
the
gallant
and
the
lucky
gentleman
whose
home
she
makes
happy
long
life
and
the
enjoyment
of
a
montana
home
i
am
truly
yours
howard
press
notices
the
plains
in
is
the
title
under
which
a
lady
in
the
mountain
is
publishing
a
series
of
letters
the
story
of
life
on
the
plains
is
so
prettily
written
that
these
papers
repay
perusal
we
have
been
charmed
by
the
native
grace
of
the
author
and
we
send
her
our
compliments
whoever
she
may
be
we
crossed
the
plains
the
same
year
also
six
years
before
and
we
can
fully
appreciate
the
experience
of
our
unknown
friend
who
writes
so
farm
and
home
in
this
issue
we
close
our
narrative
of
pleasure
trials
of
a
trip
across
the
great
american
plains
in
it
has
been
a
plain
simple
story
and
true
to
life
and
full
of
interest
to
oldtimers
and
all
who
made
the
journey
of
the
plains
in
wagons
to
the
editor
of
this
paper
it
has
been
a
story
of
particular
interest
for
he
a
beardless
boy
then
crossed
the
plains
was
a
member
of
the
mcmahan
train
the
sick
man
for
whom
howard
often
went
foraging
for
mountain
the
plains
in
is
the
title
of
a
story
which
was
written
by
a
lady
of
virginia
city
for
the
mountain
and
came
to
a
conclusion
in
the
last
number
of
that
paper
it
was
a
plain
unvarnished
recital
of
the
experiences
of
the
journey
across
the
plains
when
were
the
favorite
conveyances
and
the
voyagers
were
subjected
to
many
vicissitudes
unknown
to
travelers
of
the
present
day
though
quite
unpretentious
as
to
literary
merit
it
has
been
interesting
in
recalling
to
the
minds
of
the
pioneers
who
have
read
it
the
eventful
scenes
of
their
own
pilgrimage
and
to
them
it
has
been
pleasant
have
felt
a
deep
interest
in
the
plains
in
all
through
these
long
series
of
letters
and
many
a
familiar
spot
has
been
brought
back
to
me
that
had
long
been
forgotten
and
as
some
of
the
actors
in
the
play
live
in
challis
i
will
say
to
that
hardinbrooke
is
still
loved
by
a
large
circle
of
friends
and
that
little
annie
is
now
a
blooming
young
lady
and
ever
worthy
the
kiss
that
the
captain
has
never
disgraced
the
title
bestowed
in
am
editor
respectfully
yours
days
on
the
road
we
start
may
as
i
sit
here
in
the
shade
of
our
with
this
blank
book
ready
to
record
the
events
of
this
our
first
day
on
the
road
the
thought
comes
to
me
are
we
here
why
have
we
left
home
friends
relatives
associates
and
loved
ones
who
have
made
so
large
a
part
of
our
lives
and
added
so
much
to
our
happiness
answers
chief
aim
in
life
is
the
pursuit
of
life
liberty
and
are
we
not
taking
great
risks
in
thus
venturing
into
the
wilderness
when
devoted
men
and
women
leave
home
friends
and
the
enjoyments
of
life
to
go
to
some
far
heathen
land
obeying
the
command
preach
my
gospel
to
every
creature
we
look
on
and
applaud
and
desire
to
emulate
them
there
is
something
so
sublime
so
noble
in
the
act
that
elevates
the
missionary
above
the
common
order
of
human
beings
that
we
are
not
surprised
that
they
make
the
sacrifice
and
we
silently
wish
that
we
too
had
been
called
to
do
missionary
work
but
when
people
who
are
comfortably
and
pleasantly
situated
pull
up
stakes
and
leave
all
or
nearly
all
that
makes
life
worth
the
living
start
on
a
long
tedious
and
perhaps
dangerous
journey
to
seek
a
home
in
a
strange
land
among
strangers
with
no
other
motive
than
that
of
bettering
their
circumstances
by
gaining
wealth
and
heaping
together
riches
that
perish
with
the
using
it
does
seem
strange
that
so
many
people
do
it
the
motive
does
not
seem
to
justify
the
inconvenience
the
anxiety
the
suspense
that
must
be
endured
yet
how
would
the
great
west
be
peopled
were
it
not
so
god
knows
best
it
is
without
doubt
this
spirit
of
restlessness
and
unsatisfied
longing
or
ambition
if
you
please
which
is
implanted
in
our
nature
by
an
creator
that
has
peopled
the
whole
earth
this
has
been
a
glorious
the
sky
most
beautifully
blue
the
atmosphere
delightfully
pure
the
birds
twittering
joyously
the
earth
seems
filled
with
joy
and
gladness
god
has
given
us
this
auspicious
day
to
inspire
our
hearts
with
hope
and
joyful
anticipation
this
our
first
journey
on
the
road
across
the
plains
and
mountains
it
was
hard
to
say
to
our
loved
and
loving
friends
knowing
that
we
were
not
at
all
likely
to
meet
again
in
this
life
i
felt
very
much
like
indulging
in
a
good
cry
but
refrained
and
dick
and
i
were
soon
speeding
over
the
beautiful
prairie
overtaking
cash
who
had
lingered
behind
the
others
waiting
for
me
penny
for
your
thoughts
cash
was
wondering
if
we
will
ever
tread
missouri
soil
again
likely
we
shall
we
are
young
in
years
with
a
long
life
before
us
no
doubt
we
will
come
on
a
visit
to
missouri
when
we
get
we
were
passing
a
very
comfortable
looking
farmhouse
men
women
and
children
were
in
the
yard
gazing
after
us
as
we
cantered
past
you
believe
they
envy
us
and
wish
they
were
going
too
why
should
they
because
it
is
so
jolly
to
be
going
across
the
continent
it
is
like
a
picnic
every
day
for
months
i
was
always
sorry
picnic
days
were
so
short
and
now
it
will
be
an
all
summer
wish
i
felt
that
way
you
sorry
to
leave
your
friends
course
i
am
but
then
i
shall
write
long
letters
to
them
and
they
will
write
to
me
and
i
will
make
new
friends
wherever
i
go
and
somehow
i
am
glad
i
am
after
we
came
within
sight
of
our
caravan
we
walked
our
ponies
and
talked
of
many
things
past
present
and
future
when
within
a
mile
or
two
of
memphis
our
first
camp
was
made
our
six
wagons
with
their
covers
and
big
tent
make
a
very
respectable
looking
camp
our
first
camp
as
we
were
provided
with
fresh
bread
cake
cold
chicken
boiled
ham
pickles
preserves
supper
was
quickly
prepared
for
our
small
family
of
four
and
we
enjoyed
it
immensely
then
comes
my
time
to
write
as
i
have
promised
friends
that
i
will
keep
a
journal
on
this
trip
kerfoot
thinks
the
government
is
going
to
smash
and
will
not
be
worth
one
cent
on
the
dollar
so
he
has
turned
all
his
money
into
gold
coin
and
stowed
it
into
a
small
leather
satchel
it
seems
quite
heavy
to
lift
or
carry
as
kerfoot
was
sitting
on
a
near
our
wagons
kerfoot
came
toward
her
saying
mother
i
want
you
to
take
care
of
this
satchel
it
is
all
we
will
ask
you
to
do
the
girls
will
cook
and
wash
dishes
the
boys
take
care
of
the
stock
and
i
will
oversee
things
generally
and
we
will
do
she
accepted
the
responsibility
without
a
word
and
as
he
walked
away
she
turned
to
me
and
said
wish
it
was
in
some
good
bank
i
expect
nothing
else
but
that
it
will
be
stolen
and
then
what
will
become
of
us
while
i
have
been
writing
neelie
cornelia
and
sittie
henrietta
have
been
getting
supper
for
a
family
of
twelve
no
small
undertaking
for
them
as
they
have
been
used
to
servants
and
know
very
little
about
cooking
when
everything
was
ready
neelie
came
to
her
mother
exclaiming
mamma
to
supper
the
first
ever
prepared
by
your
own
little
girl
but
not
the
last
i
hope
see
how
nicely
the
table
looks
emma
and
delia
picked
those
wild
flowers
for
you
how
brightly
the
new
tinware
shines
let
us
imagine
it
is
silver
and
it
will
answer
the
same
purpose
as
if
it
her
mother
smiles
cheerfully
as
she
takes
her
arm
cash
sneers
at
nonsense
as
she
calls
it
kerfoot
nods
approval
as
neelie
escorts
her
mother
to
the
table
when
all
are
seated
kerfoot
bows
his
head
and
asks
blessing
on
the
meal
every
one
seems
to
enjoy
this
picnic
style
of
taking
supper
out
of
doors
and
linger
so
long
at
the
table
that
neelie
has
to
hint
that
other
work
will
have
to
be
done
before
dark
when
at
last
the
table
is
cleared
she
says
to
emma
and
delia
you
want
to
help
me
wash
these
nice
bright
dishes
and
put
them
away
they
are
always
ready
to
help
neelie
and
the
work
is
soon
done
amid
laughter
and
fun
they
hardly
realize
they
have
been
at
work
kerfoot
insists
that
we
women
and
the
children
must
sleep
in
houses
as
long
as
there
are
houses
to
sleep
in
mother
and
i
would
greatly
prefer
sleeping
in
our
to
making
a
bed
on
the
floor
in
a
room
with
so
many
but
as
he
has
hired
the
room
we
do
not
want
to
seem
contrary
so
have
offered
no
objection
the
boys
have
carried
the
mattresses
and
bedding
into
the
house
and
neelie
has
come
for
me
to
go
with
her
to
arrange
our
so
through
memphis
may
we
were
up
with
the
sun
this
morning
after
a
night
of
refreshing
and
restful
sleep
neelie
and
i
commenced
folding
the
bedclothes
ready
to
be
sent
to
the
wagons
when
she
startled
me
with
a
merry
peal
of
laughter
here
miss
sallie
see
treasure
she
has
left
it
on
the
floor
under
the
head
of
her
bed
say
anything
and
i
will
put
it
in
the
bottom
of
a
trunk
where
it
ought
to
be
and
we
will
see
how
long
it
will
be
before
she
misses
she
thought
of
it
while
at
breakfast
and
started
up
excitedly
daughter
did
you
see
that
precious
satchel
ma
i
have
taken
care
of
it
and
put
it
where
it
will
not
be
left
lying
around
loose
any
you
my
dear
i
am
glad
you
have
taken
care
of
mother
i
did
not
expect
you
to
carry
that
burden
around
on
your
arm
by
day
and
sleep
with
it
at
night
i
only
intend
for
you
to
have
entire
charge
of
it
and
put
it
where
the
rest
of
us
do
not
know
the
hiding
place
so
that
when
we
are
obliged
to
have
some
we
will
have
to
come
to
you
to
get
it
and
then
give
it
sparingly
for
much
very
much
depends
upon
what
is
in
that
i
meet
an
acquaintance
we
came
to
memphis
about
nine
court
is
in
session
several
friends
and
acquaintances
who
are
attending
court
came
to
the
wagons
to
say
brother
uncle
zack
was
among
them
he
said
when
you
wish
yourselves
back
here
that
told
you
not
to
we
will
when
that
times
comes
and
send
you
a
vote
of
thanks
for
your
good
advice
i
replied
cash
neelie
and
i
have
been
riding
our
ponies
all
day
we
are
stopping
in
a
beautiful
place
for
camping
near
the
farmhouse
of
a
and
fifer
they
are
very
pleasant
elderly
people
who
have
raised
a
family
of
six
children
who
are
all
married
and
gone
to
homes
of
their
own
it
is
a
delightfully
homey
home
yet
it
seems
sad
that
they
should

brother
hillhouse
discovered
very
early
this
morning
that
the
tire
on
one
of
the
wheels
of
the
was
broken
he
started
off
ahead
of
the
rest
of
the
wagons
to
find
a
blacksmith
shop
and
get
it
mended
by
the
time
we
would
overtake
him
it
was
ten
when
we
came
to
the
shop
near
a
there
was
a
very
bad
piece
of
road
before
we
crossed
the
creek
a
deep
ditch
had
been
washed
out
by
the
spring
rains
i
waited
to
see
the
wagons
safely
over
when
some
one
came
beside
my
pony
with
outstretched
hand
saying
miss
raymond
i
see
you
are
in
earnest
about
crossing
the
how
do
you

smith
am
glad
to
see
you
of
course
i
am
in
earnest
about
crossing
the
plains
but
where
did
you
come
from
i
supposed
you
would
be
at
the
missouri
river
before
this
time
have
you
turned
back
no
we
are
waiting
for
better
roads
and
good

will
promise
you
good

and
the
roads
will
are
cash
and
neelie

not
stop
when
i
waited
to
see
the
wagons
over
the
i
have
missed

them

in
the
mill
when
they
passed

me
to
them

few
days

until

and
waving
him
i
spoke
to
dick
and
he
cantered
up
the
hill
past
the
mill
and
the
wagons
i
soon
caught
up
with
cash
and
neelie
who
i
saw
at
the
mill

bob

overtake

in
a
few
hope
they
will
they
would
be
quite
an
addition
to
our
an
addition
to
our
party
but
they
do
you
suppose
they
are
going
to
let
us
see
them
cooking
and
washing
dishes
not
if
they
know
themselves
then
they
would
have
to
play
the
agreeable
once
in
a
while
and
that
is
what
they
are
not
going
to
do
on
a
trip
of
this
kind
i
do
not
expect
to
see
them
they
would
rather
stay
where
they
are
another
week
than
join
our
believe
you
are
right
neelie
for
he
did
not
say
as
if
he
expected
to
see
me
very
when
it
was
time
to
stop
for
lunch
we
found
a
very
nice
place
and
waited
for
the
wagons
while
at
lunch
we
saw
an
emigrant
wagon
drawn
by
three
yoke
of
oxen
coming
up
the
road
and
were
somewhat
surprised
to
see
it
turn
from
the
road
and
come
toward
our
camp
it
proved
to
be
john
milburn
of
etna
and
his
sister
augusta
they
have
traveled
in
one
day
and
a
half
the
distance
we
have
been
two
and
a
half
days
coming
miss
milburn
is
a
very
intelligent
young
lady
some
two
or
three
years
my
senior
we
are
not
very
well
acquainted
with
her
but
have
met
her
frequently
and
have
known
of
her
several
years
she
is
an
active
member
of
the
presbyterian
church
at
etna
she
has
her
little
nephew
ernest
talbot
with
her
he
is
seven
years
old
her
dying
gift
a
very
bright
child
and
considerably
spoiled
but
dear
to
his
heart
as
her
own
life
they
have
started
to
montana
to
get
rich
in
the
gold
mines
milburn
leaves
a
wife
and
two
small
children
with
his
widowed
mother
to
watch
and
wait
and
pray
for
his
success
and
safe
return
home
we
crossed
the
dividing
line
though
we
did
not
see
it
between
missouri
and
iowa
soon
after
noon
and
it
is
very
probable
some
of
us
will
never
tread
missouri
soil
again
as
we
were
coming
through
stilesville
a
small
town
this
side
the
line
there
were
several
loafers
in
front
of
a
saloon
who
acted
very
rudely
to
say
the
least
we
distinctly
heard
such
remarks
as
the
following
what
pretty
girls
and
how
well
they
ride
missourians
boys
try
our
luck
maybe
we
can
each
hook
a
pony
team
is
so
tired
out
with
such
fast
driving
that
we
have
stopped
earlier
than
usual
and
i
have
had
more
time
to
write
we
are
only
two
or
three
miles
from
stilesville
the
weather
is
perfect
we
will
sleep
in
the
wagons
kerfoot
thinks
it
necessary
to
guard
the
camp
i
believe
it
an
unnecessary
precaution
for
if
those
loafers
at
stilesville
had
meant
mischief
they
would
not
have
expressed
themselves
so
freely
however
ezra
and
frank
kerfoot
nephews
sim
buford
and
brother
hillhouse
will
take
turns
standing
guard
each
one
for
two
hours
thursday
may
oh
how
we
did
sleep
last
night
dreamless
and
sound
our
first
night
in
the
wagons
was
undisturbed
and
sweet
we
were
up
with
the
birds
making
ready
for
an
early
start
mother
prepares
breakfast
while
i
roll
up
the
beds
and
cover
closely
to
protect
them
from
the
dust
one
of
the
boys
milks
the
cows
while
i
assist
mother
and
when
breakfast
of
hot
biscuit
ham
and
eggs
coffee
and
which
i
should
have
mentioned
first
is
over
i
strain
the
milk
into
an
churn
that
is
big
at
the
bottom
and
little
at
the
top
cover
closely
and
fix
it
in
the
front
of
the
freight
wagon
where
it
will
be
churned
by
the
motion
of
the
wagon
and
we
have
a
pat
of
the
sweetest
most
delicious
butter
when
we
stop
in
the
evening
that
any
one
ever
tasted
mother
washes
the
dishes
we
prepare
lunch
for
our
noon
meal
i
stow
it
in
the
under
the
seat
in
the
the
boys
take
the
pipe
off
the
little
stove
empty
the
fire
out
and
leave
it
to
cool
while
i
am
putting
things
away
in
the
places
where
they
belong
it
is
wonderful
how
soon
we
have
learned
to
live
in
a
wagon
and
we
seem
to
have
an
abundance
of
room
when
horses
are
harnessed
oxen
yoked
and
everything
ready
to
start
we
girls
proceed
to
saddle
our
ponies
some
of
the
boys
usually
come
and
offer
assistance
which
is
politely
declined
as
we
are
going
to
wait
upon
ourselves
on
this
trip
the
wagons
start
leaving
us
to
follow
at
our
leisure
we
don
our
made
of
denim
that
completely
cover
and
protect
us
from
mud
and
dust
tie
on
our
mount
our
ponies
unassisted
and
soon
overtake
and
pass
the
wagons
we
started
this
morning
at
seven
it
is
delightful
riding
horseback
in
the
early
morning
bloomfield
iowa
we
were
on
the
lookout
for
bloomfield
about
ten
we
could
see
the
spires
and
steeples
glittering
in
the
sunshine
when
we
reached
the
suburbs
we
stopped
to
wait
for
the
wagons
when
we
reached
the
business
part
of
the
city
i
dismounted
and
made
ready
to
do
some
shopping
as
a
few
necessary
articles
had
been
forgotten
when
purchasing
our
outfit
you
going
with
me
girls
dear
no
not
in
these
togs
short
dresses
thick
shoes
think
we
appear
much
better
in
our
short
dresses
thick
shoes
and
than
we
would
in
trailing
skirts
french
kid
shoes
and
hats
of
the
latest
style
especially
as
we
are
emigrants
and
not
ladies
at
home
however
i
do
not
wish
you
to
suffer
mortification
on
my
account
some
one
of
the
boys
will
go
with
i
go
miss
sallie
ezra
asked
and
thank
you
we
called
at
two
drug
stores
one
grocery
and
several
establishments
and
made
several
small
purchases
the
clerks
seemed
quite
interested
and
asked
numerous
questions
some
wished
they
were
going
too
others
thought
we
had
a
long
hard
journey
before
us
when
we
came
back
they
were
waiting
for
us
i
gave
the
satchel
containing
the
purchases
into
care
mounted
dick
and
we
were
soon
on
the
way
about
a
mile
from
bloomfield
we
stopped
for
lunch
of
sandwiches
cheese
fruit
and
milk
we
all
have
such
ravenous
appetites
the
plainest
food
is
relished
and
enjoyed
as
we
never
enjoyed
food
before
if
any
one
suffering
from
loss
of
appetite
or
insomnia
would
take
a
trip
of
this
kind
they
would
soon
find
their
appetite
and
sleep
the
night
through
without
waking
brother
winthrop
wanted
to
ride
dick
this
afternoon
so
i
took
passage
with
mother
and
drove
the
horses
until
i
began
to
nod
when
i
gave
the
lines
to
her
and
climbed
back
into
the
wagon
for
an
afternoon
nap
i
waked
up
as
we
were
driving
into
drakesville
a
small
but
very
pretty
town
mother
and
i
talked
the
rest
of
the
afternoon
she
enjoys
this
life
as
much
as
i
do
we
built
for
our
future
habitation
i
trust
there
was
not
enough
selfishness
in
the
building
material
to
hurt
us
if
they
tumble
about
our
ears
mother
seems
happier
than
she
has
since
the
war
commenced
and
our
eldest
brother
mac
went
into
the
army
we
stopped
for
the
night
earlier
than
usual
about
five
we
are
camping
in
a
lane
near
a
farmhouse
our
little
stove
is
taken
down
from
its
place
on
a
shelf
at
the
back
of
the
freight
wagon
mother
gets
dinner
and
prepares
something
for
lunch
at
the
same
time
the
boys
buy
feed
from
the
farmers
as
the
grass
is
not
long
enough
to
satisfy
the
horses
and
cattle
i
write
as
long
as
it
is
light
enough
to
see
the
young
people
complain
about
my
taking
so
much
time
to
write
but
since
i
have
commenced
i
can
not
stop
i
am
thinking
all
the
time
about
what
things
are
worth
recording
a
call
to
dinner
beautiful
apples
after
dinner
mother
washes
the
dishes
and
makes
all
the
arrangements
she
can
for
an
early
breakfast
she
thinks
i
am
another
beecher
stowe
so
she
is
perfectly
willing
to
do
the
work
in
the
evening
and
let
me
write
oh
the
unselfishness
of
mothers
i
do
my
share
of
course
mornings
and
at
noon
but
evenings
i
only
make
the
beds
in
both
wagons
we
have
white
sheets
and
with
a
pair
of
blankets
and
light
comforts
on
both
beds
just
the
same
as
at
home
and
they
do
not
soil
any
more
or
any
quicker
as
we
have
them
carefully
protected
from
dust
i
had
been
writing
a
little
while
after
dinner
when
frank
stepped
up
with
a
basket
of
beautiful
apples
in
his
hand
not
a
wilted
one
among
them
shall
i
put
them
frank
how
lovely
they
are
where
did
you
get
them
thank
you
so
much
they
are
not
for
me
as
he
emptied
the
last
one
into
the
pan
all
the
others
supplied
this
seems
more
than
my
they
are
for
you
we
bought
the
entire
stock
the
others
are
supplied
or
will
be
without
you
giving
them
he
had
just
gone
when
sim
buford
came
and
threw
half
a
dozen
especially
beautiful
ones
into
my
lap
you
sim
but
i
am
bountifully
supplied
you
see
you
are
but
keep
mine
too
i
can
guess
who
it
was
that
forestalled
laughing
as
he
walked
off
so
we
are
feasting
on
luscious
apples
this
evening
thanks
to
the
generosity
of
our
young
gentlemen
friday
may
we
came
through
unionville
and
moravia
have
traveled
farther
and
later
than
any
day
yet
it
was
almost
dark
when
we
stopped
and
raining
too
to
make
a
bad
matter
worse
we
are
camping
in
a
disagreeable
muddy
place
and
have
to
use
lanterns
to
cook
by
we
were
obliged
to
come
so
far
to
get
a
lot
large
enough
to
hold
the
stock
we
will
be
glad
to
sleep
in
the
house
kerfoot
is
homesick
blue
and
despondent
this
evening
she
has
always
had
such
an
easy
life
that
anything
disagreeable
discourages
her
perhaps
when
the
sun
shines
again
she
will
feel
all
right
saturday
may
this
morning
dawned
clear
and
bright
all
nature
seemed
refreshed
by
rain
and
we
started
joyfully
on
our
journey
once
more
we
came
through
iconium
early
in
the
day
are
camping
in
lucas
county
near
a
beautiful
farmhouse
we
expect
to
stay
here
until
monday
as
we
do
not
intend
to
travel
on
sundays
it
is
a
beautiful
moonlight
night
some
one
proposes
a
walk
as
cash
is
giving
winthrop
his
first
lessons
in
flirtation
they
of
course
go
together
sim
and
neelie
miss
milburn
and
ezra
are
the
next
to
start
and
frank
is
waiting
to
go
with
me
hill
stays
in
camp
in
conversation
with
kerfoot
and
milburn
he
is
more
like
an
old
man
than
the
boy
that
he
is
not
twenty
yet
after
we
had
gone
a
short
distance
miss
milburn
asked
to
be
excused
and
returned
to
camp
ezra
of
course
going
with
her
we
walked
on
for
a
mile
or
more
enjoying
the
beautiful
moonlight
and
having
lots
of
fun
as
happy
young
people
will
have
when
we
returned
and
i
had
said
to
the
others
i
climbed
into
the
wagon
to
finish
my
writing
for
the
day
by
the
light
of
the
lantern
the
front
of
wagon
almost
touches
the
back
of
ours
forming
an
angle
i
had
been
writing
a
few
moments
when
i
heard
sobbing
i
was
out
in
a
jiffy
and
had
gone
to
the
front
of
their
wagon
without
stopping
to
think
whether
i
was
intruding
i
come
in
i
asked
as
i
stepped
upon
the
yes
come
in
miss
sallie
but
i
am
ashamed
to
let
you
see
me
crying
somehow
i
could
not
help
it
i
felt
so
lonely
and
am
sorry
you
feel
lonely
and
homesick
did
any
of
us
say
or
do
anything
this
evening
that
could
have
hurt
you
no
not
at
all
only
i
always
feel
that
i
am
one
too
many
when
i
am
with
you
all
you
seem
so
and
happy
so
free
from
care
so
full
of
life
and
fun
that
i
feel
that
i
am
a
damper
to
your
joyousness
for
i
can
not
get
over
feeling
homesick
and
sad
especially
when
night
sweetly
ernest
sleeps
and
how
much
he
seems
to
enjoy
this
manner
of
he
is
a
great
comfort
to
me
as
well
as
a
great
care
he
is
dearer
to
me
than
to
any
one
else
in
the
world
his
father
seems
to
be
weaned
from
him
since
they
have
been
separated
so
long
he
has
not
seen
him
more
than
half
a
dozen
times
since
his
mother
died
i
feel
that
he
is
altogether
mine
may
god
help
me
to
train
him
for
heaven
he
will
never
know
what
i
have
sacrificed
for
him
i
have
a
mind
to
tell
you
if
you
care
to
hear
why
i
am
here
and
why
i
am
not
may
perhaps
relieve
you
and
lighten
the
burden
to
share
and
then
she
told
me
what
i
will
record
for
it
is
almost
midnight
and
mother
has
been
asleep
for
two
hours
and
i
must
hie
me
to
bed
miss
love
story
course
you
have
heard
about
my
engagement
to
jim
miller
i
know
it
has
been
talked
i
have
heard
the
matter
have
been
engaged
two
years
and
were
to
be
married
next
month
he
insisted
that
i
must
give
up
ernest
to
mother
i
felt
that
i
would
be
violating
a
sacred
trust
and
that
mother
is
too
old
to
have
the
care
of
such
a
child
and
i
told
him
so
we
quarreled
and
while
i
was
feeling
hurt
and
indignant
i
told
brother
john
i
would
go
with
him
to
montana
he
gladly
accepted
my
offer
and
his
wife
was
so
glad
john
would
have
some
one
to
take
care
of
him
if
he
got
sick
so
here
i
am
and
i
know
i
ought
not
to
have
come
for
jim
miller
is
dearer
to
me
than
my
own
am
so
sorry
for
you
yet
i
believe
that
in
some
way
it
will
be
for
the
best
you
know
the
promise
things
work
together
for
good
to
those
who
love
the
will
try
to
believe
it
you
have
done
me
good
miss
sallie
i
am
glad
you
came
come
sunday
may
the
sabbath
day
to
keep
it
have
we
obeyed
this
command
i
fear
not
we
are
all
or
very
nearly
all
professing
christians
yet
we
have
had
no
public
worship
in
our
camp
but
we
have
all
to
some
extent
desecrated
the
day
by
work
deeds
of
mercy
and
necessity
may
be
done
on
the
sabbath
day
without
sin
and
mother
says
is
very
necessary
that
our
soiled
clothes
sheets
and
should
be
washed
and
that
cleanliness
is
next
to
the
question
comes
to
me
why
is
it
that
christians
are
so
loath
to
talk
of
the
things
that
pertain
to
their
spiritual
life
and
eternal
welfare
why
so
backward
about
introducing
a
service
of
worship
when
so
well
aware
it
would
meet
with
the
approval
of
all
i
felt
that
kerfoot
was
the
one
to
suggest
a
service
of
prayer
and
praise
and
reading
the
scriptures
perhaps
he
thought
some
of
the
ladies
would
mention
it
so
all
were
silent
and
it
is
numbered
with
the
lost
opportunities
for
doing
something
for
our
lord
and
master
may
he
pardon
our
sins
of
omission
and
may
we
be
permitted
to
atone
for
the
manner
in
which
we
spent
our
first
sabbath
on
this
trip
we
have
not
traveled
so
our
teams
have
rested
and
done
no
labor
if
we
have
violated
the
commandment
ourselves
the
weather
is
perfect
this
is
another
beautiful
moonlight
night
the
young
ladies
and
gentlemen
have
gone
for
another
walk
in
the
same
order
as
last
night
except
frank
went
with
miss
milburn
and
ezra
is
waiting
for
me
a
letter
to
brother
mac
monday
may
i
left
camp
very
early
and
walked
on
alone
that
i
may
write
to
brother
mac
before
the
wagons
overtake
me
i
am
seated
in
a
comfortable
fence
corner
and
here
goes
for
my
letter
lucas
county
iowa
may
dear
brother
we
were
delayed
several
days
after
the
time
set
for
starting
when
we
wrote
you
to
meet
us
at
council
bluffs
by
the
we
thought
i
would
better
write
that
you
may
know
we
are
on
the
way
and
hope
to
meet
you
by
the
or
the
you
must
possess
your
soul
with
patience
if
you
get
there
before
we
do
and
have
to
wait
i
could
write
a
long
letter
i
have
so
much
to
tell
you
but
will
wait
until
we
meet
mother
seems
in
better
health
and
spirits
than
she
has
since
you
went
into
the
army
we
are
enjoying
the
trip
very
much
and
i
find
myself
feeling
sorry
for
the
people
that
have
to
stay
at
home
and
can
not
travel
and
camp
out
until
next
week
with
sincerest
love
your
sister
sarah
the
wagons
are
coming
in
sight
just
as
my
letter
is
finished
and
addressed
and
ready
to
mail
at
the
next
my
pony
is
in
harness
as
one
of
the
work
horses
is
a
little
lame
so
i
will
have
to
ride
in
the
wagon
or
walk
as
the
morning
is
so
fine
i
will
walk
until
i
begin
to
tire
evening
cash
joined
me
in
my
walk
and
we
walked
until
noon
how
wisely
planned
are
these
physical
bodies
of
ours
how
easily
inured
to
the
burdens
they
must
bear
before
we
started
on
this
trip
such
a
walk
as
we
took
this
morning
would
have
completely
prostrated
us
now
we
did
not
feel
any
inconvenience
from
the
unusual
exercise
frank
invited
us
cash
and
i
to
ride
in
his
wagon
this
afternoon
we
accepted
the
invitation
and
made
an
emigrant
visit
he
had
arranged
his
wagon
for
our
convenience
and
comfort
and
we
spent
a
very
pleasant
afternoon
frank
mailed
my
letter
at
charaton
and
on
his
way
back
bought
candy
and
nuts
for
a
treat
for
his
visitors
which
we
of
course
enjoyed
exceedingly
i
should
not
care
to
ride
in
an
all
the
way
across
the
plains
but
for
half
a
day
once
in
a
while
it
is
a
pleasant
change
especially
when
so
delightfully
entertained
the
afternoon
passed
quickly
we
are
camping
near
a
large
party
of
emigrants
some
of
the
men
came
to
our
camp
they
look
tough
they
are
from
pike
county
missouri
on
their
way
to
oregon
tuesday
may
a
beautiful
day
for
horseback
riding
until
late
this
afternoon
when
it
commenced
blowing
a
perfect
gale
too
severe
to
travel
so
we
drove
into
camp
early
we
came
through
ottawa
and
osceola
are
camping
in
clark
county
wednesday
may
a
very
cold
day
for
this
time
of
year
too
cold
to
think
of
riding
horseback
so
we
all
took
passage
in
the
wagons
as
we
have
plenty
to
read
and
lots
of
visiting
to
do
it
is
no
hardship
to
ride
in
the
wagon
for
a
day
the
boys
have
made
a
splendid
and
we
are
getting
thawed
out
cheered
and
ready
for
a
jolly
evening
there
was
just
one
stunted
oak
left
standing
away
out
here
in
this
great
expanse
of
prairie
for
our
especial
benefit
it
seems
the
boys
cut
it
down
and
taking
the
trunk
for
a
the
top
and
branches
to
build
the
fire
we
have
a
glorious
away
out
here
in
union
county
iowa
it
is
surprising
to
find
iowa
so
sparsely
settled
we
travel
sometimes
half
a
day
and
do
not
see
a
home
there
are
always
a
few
farms
near
the
towns
the
settlements
are
the
only
breaks
in
the
monotonous
landscape
oh
the
tedious
tiresome
monotony
of
these
vast
extended
prairies
to
look
out
and
away
over
these
seemingly
endless
levels
as
far
as
the
eye
can
reach
and
see
only
grass
grass
everywhere
with
beautiful
prairie
flowers
of
course
but
the
flowers
can
not
be
seen
in
the
distance
no
earthly
consideration
would
induce
me
to
make
a
home
on
any
of
these
immense
prairie
levels
how
my
eyes
long
for
a
sight
of
beautiful
trees
and
running
streams
of
water
how
delightful
to
stroll
in
the
woods
once
more
thursday
may
the
wish
expressed
last
evening
is
realized
in
a
manner
we
are
camping
in
a
strip
of
timber
along
the
banks
of
a
creek
or
branch
rather
but
then
it
is
such
a
stream
not
at
all
limpid
clear
or
sparkling
as
a
brook
ought
to
be
it
can
hardly
be
called
a
running
stream
for
it
goes
too
slowly
i
think
creeping
or
crawling
would
be
more
appropriate
we
came
through
afton
the
icarian
community
friday
may
brother
birthday
he
is
twenty
years
old
we
made
a
birthday
cake
for
him
last
night
we
divided
it
into
twenty
pieces
at
lunch
and
there
was
just
enough
to
go
around
and
leave
two
pieces
for
himself
the
girls
say
we
must
have
some
kind
of
a
jollification
i
hope
they
will
leave
me
out
for
i
want
to
write
about
the
we
came
through
queen
city
this
morning
and
this
afternoon
came
to
a
town
of
french
people
called
icarian
call
to
dinner
later
they
have
excused
me
but
why
icarian
i
can
not
understand
for
certainly
they
did
not
impress
me
as
high
flyers
neither
as
flyers
at
all
they
seemed
the
most
humdrum
folks
i
have
ever
seen
every
dwelling
is
exactly
alike
of
one
room
with
one
door
one
window
a
with
stick
chimney
i
rode
close
by
the
open
doors
of
some
of
the
houses
and
tried
to
talk
with
the
women
but
we
could
not
understand
each
other
at
all
the
floors
windows
and
everything
in
the
houses
were
scrupulously
clean
but
not
one
bit
of
brightness
or
color
not
a
thread
of
carpet
or
a
rug
and
all
the
and
dresses
made
of
heavy
blue
denim
with
white
kerchiefs
around
the
shoulders
and
pinned
across
the
front
of
the
waist
the
skirt
above
the
ankles
and
very
narrow
and
heavy
shoes
the
men
and
boys
all
looked
alike
too
but
i
did
not
observe
them
closely
enough
to
describe
them
there
are
several
large
long
buildings
one
with
a
large
bell
in
belfry
on
top
of
building
they
are
and
two
others
i
did
not
learn
what
they
are
used
for
all
the
buildings
are
one
story
of
the
plainest
architecture
for
the
one
purpose
of
shelter
from
sun
and
storm
there
is
not
a
thing
to
ornament
or
beautify
not
a
or
flower
yet
everything
men
women
children
houses
yards
and
streets
are
as
clean
as
they
can
be
made
they
are
peaceable
citizens
live
entirely
independent
of
the
people
of
adjoining
neighborhoods
they
are
supposed
to
be
wealthy
the
town
is
the
center
of
and
farms
the
principle
upon
which
the
community
is
founded
is
a
sort
of
communism
in
which
all
things
are
the
common
property
of
all
they
live
upon
what
their
farms
produce
have
vast
herds
of
cattle
and
sheep
a
fine
site
for
their
town
and
seem
the
picture
of
contentment
which
is
better
than
riches
we
stopped
within
sight
of
quincy
and
another
camping
outfit
we
soon
learned
they
are
harding
and
morrison
and
family
from
lewis
county
we
are
acquainted
with
harding
and
have
often
heard
of
the
morrisons
morrison
and
harding
came
over
and
the
men
have
had
a
sociable
gossiping
time
this
evening
the
men
can
surpass
the
women
gossiping
any
time
notwithstanding
the
general
belief
to
the
contrary
the
young
folks
have
been
playing
games
to
celebrate
birthday
they
had
hard
work
to
get
him
to
join
them
a
swing
among
the
trees
saturday
may
we
drove
only
until
noon
and
stopped
to
stay
over
sunday
so
that
we
can
do
our
washing
and
baking
without
violating
the
sabbath
we
do
not
have
collars
and
cuffs
and
fine
starched
things
to
do
up
but
we
have
a
great
many
pocket
handkerchiefs
aprons
stockings
etc
we
have
pretty
bead
collars
made
of
black
and
white
beads
tied
with
a
ribbon
that
always
look
nice
and
do
not
get
soiled
we
are
in
a
beautiful
grove
of
trees
the
boys
have
put
up
a
swing
there
is
nothing
in
the
way
of
play
that
i
enjoy
as
i
do
a
good
high
swing
there
are
plenty
of
boys
to
swing
us
as
high
as
we
want
to
go
i
fear
the
sabbath
will
be
desecrated
with
play
if
not
with
work
for
the
temptation
to
swing
will
be
hard
to
resist
sunday
may
the
horses
went
off
two
or
three
miles
last
night
the
men
were
all
off
bright
and
early
this
morning
hunting
them
kerfoot
found
them
and
came
back
about
nine
by
the
time
they
were
all
here
the
work
was
finished
and
we
were
ready
for
what
a
day
to
spend
in
rest
and
service
for
the
master
oh
no
a
day
spent
in
swinging
frivolous
conversation
and
fun
i
am
ashamed
to
tell
it
but
it
is
nevertheless
true
and
i
believe
we
all
thought
less
about
a
service
of
worship
than
we
did
last
sunday
it
is
so
hard
to
get
right
if
we
do
not
start
right
we
have
visitors
in
camp
two
gentlemen
from
clark
county
neighbors
of
the
kerfoots
suitor
and
mr
rain
they
started
for
the
gold
mines
in
montana
two
or
three
weeks
ago
after
reaching
the
missouri
river
they
heard
such
frightful
stories
of
indian
depredations
being
committed
on
the
plains
that
they
sold
their
outfit
for
what
they
could
get
and
are
returning
home
on
horseback
poor
fellows
how
i
pity
any
man
that
has
so
little
grit
i
should
think
they
would
be
ashamed
to
show
their
faces
to
their
neighbors
and
say
were
afraid
so
we
came
back
i
believe
kerfoot
is
the
only
one
of
our
party
who
would
be
willing
to
turn
back
and
perhaps
she
would
not
if
it
were
put
to
the
test
we
would
not
like
to
be
scalped
and
butchered
by
the
indians
but
it
does
seem
so
cowardly
to
run
away
from
a
possible
danger
everlasting
arms
are
god
can
and
will
take
care
of
us
as
well
on
the
plains
as
anywhere
he
is
leading
us
through
unknown
paths
we
can
trust
him
heaven
is
as
near
one
place
as
another
our
second
sunday
has
not
been
much
of
an
improvement
on
our
first
the
first
we
worked
we
have
played
the
boys
swung
us
all
morning
until
we
were
ready
to
we
had
sunday
dinner
between
two
and
three
then
we
wrote
letters
to
friends
at
home
read
until
sleepy
took
a
nap
of
an
hour
then
suitor
and
mr
rain
came
and
we
listened
to
their
frightful
stories
of
what
the
indians
are
doing
to
emigrants
i
left
them
in
disgust
to
come
and
record
our
misdoings
of
this
our
second
sunday
on
the
road
it
is
almost
bedtime
and
i
must
make
the
beds
for
we
are
early
to
bed
and
early
to
rise
while
on
this
trip
a
fatal
accident
monday
may
alas
alas
how
can
i
write
the
disastrous
happenings
of
this
day
my
hand
trembles
and
my
pencil
refuses
to
write
intelligibly
when
i
attempt
to
record
the
sad
oh
so
sad
accident
that
has
befallen
us
we
parted
from
our
visitors
this
morning
and
started
on
our
way
feeling
rested
and
glad
to
be
journeying
on
again
how
little
we
knew
of
what
a
day
would
bring
forth
we
stopped
for
lunch
at
noon
in
a
little
vale
or
depression
on
the
prairie
but
where
there
was
no
water
just
as
we
had
finished
our
lunch
neelie
came
she
said
to
see
if
we
could
make
an
exchange
for
the
afternoon
her
mother
riding
with
mine
and
i
with
the
young
folks
in
the
family
wagon
of
course
it
was
soon
arranged
and
i
told
her
i
would
come
as
soon
as
i
helped
mother
put
things
away
we
sometimes
visit
in
this
way
kerfoot
soon
came
around
and
when
everything
was
ready
i
started
to
go
to
their
wagon
it
was
the
last
one
in
the
train
as
i
was
passing
wagon
he
called
to
me
to
and
get
a
drink
of
he
had
taken
a
long
walk
and
found
clear
pure
water
not
very
cold
but
much
better
than
none
at
all
i
gratefully
accepted
a
cup
he
and
his
sister
then
invited
me
to
ride
with
them
i
told
them
of
my
engagement
with
neelie
and
of
course
they
excused
me
oh
that
i
had
accepted
their
invitation
just
such
a
little
thing
as
that
might
have
prevented
this
dreadful
accident
such
great
events
turn
on
such
little
hinges
sometimes
about
three
in
the
afternoon
as
we
were
plodding
along
after
the
fashion
of
emigrant
teams
we
young
people
in
the
last
wagon
having
a
jolly
sociable
time
with
song
and
laughter
fun
and
merriment
the
front
wagons
stopped
ezra
who
was
driving
turned
out
of
the
road
and
passed
some
of
the
wagons
to
see
what
the
trouble
was
kerfoot
came
running
toward
us
calling
to
neelie
the
camphor
daughter
milburn
has
shot
himself
somehow
and
has
ezra
got
out
to
go
with
him
and
neelie
asked
we
come
too
papa
my
daughter
you
girls
would
better
stay
here
your
ma
and
raymond
are
with
gus
and
they
will
know
what
to
before
he
had
finished
what
he
was
saying
they
were
running
to
the
place
of
the
accident
we
could
only
wait
hoping
and
praying
oh
so
earnestly
that
it
might
not
prove
so
serious
as
manner
and
tone
caused
us
to
fear
afterward
winthrop
came
to
us
he
was
pale
with
compressed
lips
and
sad
eyes
he
came
up
close
leaned
upon
the
wagon
wheel
and
said
in
a
low
tone
is
oh
how
dreadful
we
all
left
the
wagon
and
went
to
the
front
as
fast
as
we
could
i
have
gathered
from
witnesses
the
following
account
of
how
it
happened
there
was
a
flock
of
prairie
chickens
ahead
of
the
wagons
to
the
left
of
the
road
milburn
and
several
of
the
boys
took
their
guns
and
were
going
to
try
to
thin
their
number
the
wagons
had
not
halted
but
were
moving
slowly
on
the
hunters
had
gone
on
a
little
in
advance
of
the
wagons
they
tried
to
fire
all
together
one
of
the
boys
snapped
two
caps
on
his
gun
it
failed
to
go
off
so
he
threw
the
gun
into
the
front
wagon
and
took
his
whip
in
disgust
the
wagon
had
moved
on
to
where
milburn
was
standing
with
his
gun
raised
there
was
a
shot
milburn
dropped
to
his
knees
turned
and
looked
at
his
sister
saying
i
am
and
fell
forward
on
his
face
she
was
in
the
next
wagon
bereavement
gus
screamed
jumped
from
the
wagon
ran
to
her
brother
and
raised
his
head
in
her
arms
all
who
were
near
enough
to
hear
her
scream
ran
to
them
and
she
said
has
hurt
himself
with
his
gun
and
has
fainted
bring
restoratives
in
a
few
seconds
there
were
half
a
dozen
bottles
with
brandy
camphor
ammonia
there
and
every
effort
was
made
to
restore
him
but
all
in
vain
he
died
instantly
and
without
a
struggle
when
kerfoot
knew
he
was
dead
he
looked
for
the
wound
and
found
a
between
his
shoulders
just
then
one
of
the
boys
picked
up
his
gun
where
he
had
dropped
it
and
exclaimed
was
not
this
gun
that
did
the
mischief
for
it
is
cold
and
the
load
is
in
on
looking
around
to
find
where
the
deadly
shot
had
come
from
some
one
took
hold
of
the
gun
in
the
front
wagon
this
gun
is
warm
it
must
have
been
this
gun
went
no
it
could
not
have
been
that
gun
for
there
was
no
cap
on
it
said
the
boy
who
had
thrown
the
gun
there
circumstances
proved
that
it
was
the
gun
without
a
cap
that
did
the
fatal
shooting
i
would
have
supposed
as
the
boy
did
that
it
was
perfectly
harmless
without
a
cap
i
have
heard
it
said
is
the
unloaded
gun
or
the
one
that
is
supposed
to
be
unloaded
that
generally
does
the
no
doubt
the
hammer
was
thrown
back
when
he
threw
it
in
the
wagon
on
investigating
we
found
a
rut
in
the
just
where
he
fell
it
is
possible
that
when
the
front
wheel
dropped
into
the
rut
with
a
jolt
the
hammer
fell
igniting
the
powder
either
by
the
combustible
matter
that
stuck
or
by
the
flash
occasioned
by
the
metal
striking
together
milburn
was
not
opposite
the
wagon
when
he
raised
his
gun
to
shoot
but
the
wagons
were
moving
slowly
and
the
front
one
came
up
with
him
as
he
was
taking
aim
and
that
was
why
gus
thought
it
was
his
own
gun
she
saw
the
smoke
rise
he
stumbled
and
fell
to
his
knees
she
called
to
him
john
what
made
you
fall
he
looked
around
at
her
and
said
gus
i
am
the
last
words
he
spoke
how
hard
to
be
reconciled
to
such
a
dispensation
when
such
a
little
thing
could
have
prevented
it
only
one
step
in
either
direction
or
the
gun
pointed
the
other
way
why
oh
why
has
this
awful
thing
happened
the
poor
boy
seems
to
be
as
as
gus
in
her
unselfish
grief
she
has
been
trying
to
comfort
him
i
have
read
of
a
minister
of
the
gospel
dreamed
that
he
died
after
entering
the
gates
of
heaven
he
was
led
into
a
large
empty
room
on
the
walls
of
which
his
whole
life
was
spread
out
as
a
panorama
he
saw
all
the
events
of
his
life
and
many
that
had
been
hard
to
understand
in
his
lifetime
were
here
made
clear
and
through
it
all
the
guiding
protecting
hand
of
god
had
been
over
perhaps
milburn
is
saved
from
a
worse
fate
we
were
about
three
miles
from
frankfort
when
the
accident
happened
we
came
on
here
as
soon
as
possible
a
sorrowing
and
oh
so
sorrowful
procession
now
it
does
not
seem
that
we
can
ever
be
the
merry
party
that
we
have
been
winthrop
had
been
riding
dick
he
stood
there
ready
saddled
and
bridled
when
milburn
fell
frank
mounted
my
pony
and
rode
as
fast
as
he
could
go
to
frankfort
to
get
a
doctor
milburn
was
dead
before
he
was
out
of
sight
we
met
them
as
we
came
a
room
has
been
rented
and
milburn
prepared
for
his
last
long
sleep
the
people
of
frankfort
are
very
kind
and
sympathetic
a
funeral
tuesday
may
the
boys
sat
up
with
the
corpse
last
night
i
stayed
with
gus
we
had
only
just
shut
ourselves
in
when
a
terrific
storm
came
upon
us
the
wind
blew
and
the
rain
fell
in
torrents
before
eleven
it
had
passed
soon
after
gus
slept
heavily
it
seemed
hours
before
i
slept
very
early
this
morning
gus
awakened
me
praying
how
surely
do
the
sorrows
of
this
life
drive
us
to
the
for
comfort
refuge
and
strength
earth
no
thorns
among
its
flowers
and
life
no
fount
of
tears
we
might
forget
our
better
home
beyond
this
vale
of
what
a
precious
what
a
comforting
satisfying
faith
the
presbyterian
faith
must
be
if
one
can
really
and
conscientiously
accept
it
according
to
their
belief
one
never
dies
nothing
ever
happens
without
providence
approval
and
foreknowledge
that
it
will
happen
in
just
that
way
i
wish
i
could
accept
such
a
faith
and
believe
it
but
i
can
not
i
do
not
believe
it
was
ordained
that
milburn
should
die
in
that
way
and
at
that
time
i
believe
it
was
an
accident
that
might
have
been
prevented
by
the
most
trivial
circumstance
the
laws
of
nature
are
inexorable
if
a
bullet
is
shot
into
a
vital
part
of
the
body
it
kills
yet
god
is
able
to
bring
good
out
of
this
seemingly
great
and
grievous
evil
i
do
not
know
which
suffers
most
the
poor
boy
whose
gun
did
the
deed
or
gus
they
seem
to
take
comfort
in
each
society
and
are
together
the
most
of
the
time
i
am
so
sorry
for
both
of
them
the
funeral
services
of
the
presbyterian
church
were
held
at
two
this
afternoon
a
resident
minister
officiating
milburn
was
very
nicely
laid
away
and
his
grave
marked
and
enclosed
with
a
neat
strong
fence
before
gus
and
i
left
the
cemetery
the
people
have
been
so
very
kind
the
funeral
was
largely
attended
for
a
stranger
in
a
strange
place
there
is
no
telegraph
office
here
so
we
have
had
to
write
letters
instead
of
sending
telegrams
i
believe
plans
are
to
go
on
with
us
to
the
missouri
river
sell
her
outfit
and
return
home
by
steamboat
down
the
missouri
river
up
the
mississippi
to
canton
where
friends
will
meet
her
and
go
with
her
to
etna
wednesday
may
another
night
with
gus
she
wakes
in
the
morning
to
weep
we
started
once
more
on
our
now
sad
journey
i
have
ridden
with
gus
all
day
we
do
not
hear
the
sound
of
song
and
laughter
as
we
did
last
week
we
all
seem
to
be
under
a
pall
we
came
through
redoak
this
morning
are
camping
in
a
beautiful
place
near
a
pleasant
homelike
farmhouse
the
weather
is
perfect
thursday
may
the
friends
that
stayed
with
us
sunday
night
told
us
that
the
authorities
are
not
allowing
emigrants
to
take
the
northern
route
because
of
the
indian
depredations
that
have
been
committed
on
that
route
that
if
we
went
to
council
bluffs
we
would
have
to
come
down
the
river
to
platsmouth
to
get
on
the
southern
route
so
we
changed
our
course
accordingly
we
came
through
whitecloud
glenwood
and
pacific
city
at
whitecloud
i
made
a
few
purchases
traded
with
a
little
german
merchant
who
crossed
the
plains
a
year
ago
he
says
we
have
a
delightful
trip
before
us
he
expects
to
go
again
to
the
rocky
mountains
and
make
his
home
there
as
soon
as
he
can
sell
out
and
settle
up
his
business
here
just
before
we
came
to
glenwood
as
the
girls
passed
on
their
ponies
gus
said
to
me
go
ride
your
pony
too
you
have
not
had
a
ride
for
several
days
pardon
me
if
i
have
been
selfish
in
my
great
gus
i
would
rather
stay
with
you
than
to
ride
dick
as
long
as
you
need
you
dear
your
company
has
been
very
grateful
to
me
but
now
i
would
really
enjoy
seeing
you
ride
through
to
please
her
and
myself
too
i
soon
had
saddled
and
mounted
dick
and
overtaken
the
girls
as
we
were
riding
through
glenwood
a
photographer
sent
a
messenger
to
request
us
to
stop
five
minutes
and
let
him
take
our
we
rode
to
the
position
indicated
doffed
our
and
looked
as
pleasant
as
we
could
we
did
not
wait
to
see
the
proof
and
i
expect
he
was
disappointed
pacific
city
is
on
the
missouri
bottom
or
lowlands
above
the
town
are
the
highest
bluffs
i
have
ever
seen
we
hitched
our
ponies
and
climbed
to
the
top
the
view
was
magnificently
grand
the
sun
sinking
in
the
west
the
river
could
be
seen
in
the
distance
with
large
trees
on
the
banks
the
lowland
between
the
bluffs
and
the
trees
was
dotted
with
cattle
and
horses
grazing
here
and
there
a
pond
or
small
lake
with
its
waters
shining
and
sparkling
in
the
glimmering
sunset
the
city
below
us
in
the
shadow
of
the
bluffs
everything
was
so
sweet
and
peaceful
we
were
more
than
paid
for
our
climb
the
wagons
had
passed
before
we
came
down
so
we
mounted
and
hastened
to
overtake
them
before
driving
into
camp
on
the
banks
of
the
big
muddy
our
journey
across
iowa
at
an
end
we
are
on
the
banks
of
the
big
muddy
opposite
platsmouth
we
will
stay
here
until
things
are
sold
and
we
have
seen
her
off
on
the
steamboat
i
stay
with
her
nights
and
this
afternoon
is
the
first
time
i
have
left
her
since
the
friday
may
i
went
over
to
platsmouth
on
the
ferryboat
this
morning
with
some
friends
that
are
camping
near
us
to
do
some
shopping
for
gus
i
bought
a
black
bonnet
crèpe
veil
and
collar
and
material
for
black
suit
which
we
will
make
up
in
camp
as
there
is
a
with
us
i
was
away
about
five
hours
and
came
back
tired
and
hungry
the
weather
is
perfect
we
have
a
very
pleasant
place
to
camp
and
pleasant
people
camping
near
us
we
are
surrounded
on
all
sides
by
camps
and
still
they
come
it
seems
like
a
young
town
only
the
houses
are
built
of
canvas
instead
of
lumber
brick
or
stone
the
boys
have
put
up
a
swing
but
i
have
no
time
for
swinging
saturday
may
we
have
had
a
very
very
busy
day
kerfoot
has
sold
wagon
and
team
three
yoke
of
oxen
for
a
good
price
every
one
says
more
than
they
cost
them
i
believe
the
freight
will
be
sold
at
auction
we
have
all
helped
with
suit
and
it
is
almost
finished
hillhouse
went
up
to
council
bluffs
this
morning
expecting
to
bring
brother
mac
back
with
him
instead
of
finding
him
he
got
a
letter
also
the
one
i
wrote
a
week
ago
saying
he
was
not
coming
he
has
decided
to
study
medicine
and
will
come
west
when
he
is
an
we
are
disappointed
of
course
yet
perhaps
it
is
for
the
best
we
must
try
and
believe
so
anyway
most
perfect
weather
the
morrison
and
harding
outfit
have
come
also
several
other
families
from
lewis
and
clark
counties
the
kerfoots
are
acquainted
with
some
of
them
they
had
heard
of
the
sad
accident
some
of
them
were
friends
of
milburn
our
last
day
with
miss
milburn
sunday
may
thatcher
and
his
wife
came
to
call
upon
gus
this
afternoon
and
invited
her
to
their
home
in
platsmouth

stay
until
she

the
steamboat
for
home
thatcher
and
milburn
have
been
friends
for
years
she
accepted
their
invitation
and
will
go
there
as
the
people
from
different
camps
were
sitting
around
an
immense
not
far
from
our
wagons
someone
proposed
music
some
of
the
men
in
camp
are
fine
musicians
they
brought
their
violin
and
flute
and
gave
several
instrumental
pieces
then
some
familiar
songs
were
sung
and
someone
started
before
the
battle
they
had
sung
two
verses
when
i
heard
a
shriek
from
wagon
i
hastened
to
see
what
was
the
matter
sallie
tell
them
to
please
not
sing
that
i
can
not
bear
it
dear
brother
john
used
to
sing
it
so
much
it
breaks
my
heart
to
hear
it
i
sent
winthrop
who
had
followed
me
to
ask
them
to
stop
singing
poor
gus
she
was
more
overcome
than
i
have
seen
her
since
her
bereavement
monday
may
kerfoot
cash
neelie
ezra
and
i
came
with
gus
to
platsmouth

to
mother
kerfoot
and
the
others
this
morning
all
were
sorry
to
part
with
her
she
has
become
very
dear
to
us
all
freight
was
brought
over
in
the
wagon
and
sold
at
public
auction
and
brought
good
figures
thanks
to
thatcher
who
when
he
saw
anything
going
below
its
real
value
bid
it
in
himself
he
has
a
grocery
store
he
and
kerfoot
have
attended
to
all
business
transactions
for
gus
so
that
she
has
not
been
bothered
at
all
and
have
done
better
for
her
than
they
could
have
done
for
themselves
we
have
had
a
quiet
pleasant
day
with
gus
at
home
she
is
very
kind
and
has
invited
us
girls
to
stay
with
gus
until
she
takes
the
boat
for
home
and
gus
begged
us
to
stay
with
her
as
long
as
possible
so
cash
and
i
are
staying
all
night
and
will
see
her
on
board
the
boat
morning
neelie

returned
to
camp
with
her
father
and
ezra
ernest
is
a
great
care
and
worries
his
auntie
he
will
not
stay
in
the
house
and
she
can
not
bear
to
have
him
out
of
her
sight
for
fear
something
will
happen
to
him
she
has
just
now
undressed
him
heard
his
little
prayer
and
put
him
to
bed
in
the
next
room
so
i
hope
we
can
have
uninterrupted
quiet
for
awhile
tuesday
may
and
thatcher
cash
and
i
came
with
gus
and
ernest
to
the
steamboat
we
parted
with
them
about
nine
on
board
the
dear
friend
i
have
become
greatly
attached
to
her
in
the
three
weeks
we
have
been
so
intimately
associated
may
god
grant
her
a
quick
and
safe
journey
home
we
can
not
hope
it
will
be
a
happy
one
miss
milburn
and
her
lover
were
married
about
six
months
after
her
return
and
have
lived
happily
etc
cash
and
i
came
directly
to
camp
after
saying
to
gus
found
every
one
busy
getting
ready
for
an
early
start
we
have
been
here
almost
a
week
yet
i
have
not
had
time
to
try
the
fine
swing
the
boys
put
up
the
next
day
after
we
came
here
until
this
afternoon
the
camps
that
were
here
over
sunday
are
all
gone
except
those
that
will
travel
with
us
it
is
probable
there
will
be
half
a
dozen
more
camps
here
before
night
it
is
surprising
to
see
what
a
great
number
of
people
are
going
west
this
spring
we
hope
to
start
very
early
morning
i
trust
our
party
will
not
be
so
much
like
a
funeral
procession
as
it
has
been
since
the
vain
regrets
can
not
remedy
the
past
and
i
believe
it
is
our
duty
to
be
as
cheerful
and
happy
as
possible
in
this
life
we
have
our
pictures
taken
wednesday
may
we
were
up
with
the
earliest
dawn
and
our
own
individual
outfit
ready
for
a
very
early
start
yet
it
was
the
middle
of
the
forenoon
before
all
the
wagons
were
landed
on
the
west
bank
of
the
missouri
it
takes
a
long
while
to
ferry
fifteen
wagons
across
the
river
we
girls
rode
our
ponies
onto
the
ferryboat
they
behaved
as
if
they
had
been
used
to
ferryboats
all
their
lives
as
we
were
waiting
near
the
landing
a
stranger
a
came
apologized
for
speaking
to
us
and
asked
you
going
to
montana
a
this
man
is
mentioned
here
because
of
what
happened
to
him
before
he
reached
his
end
sir
our
destination
is
california
or
oregon
we
are
not
fully
decided
you
ought
to
go
to
montana
that
is
the
place
to
get
he
told
of
his
marvelous
success
in
that
country
since
the
indians
were
mentioned
he
spoke
of
them
with
such
contempt
said
he
would
rather
kill
an
indian
than
a
good
dog
says
he
left
a
wife
and
six
children
in
iowa
the
oldest
boy
about
fourteen
who
wanted
very
much
to
go
with
his
father
but
his
mother
needed
him
last
night
he
came
into
his
camp
he
had
run
away
from
home
says
he
is
going
to
montana
too
his
father
told
it
as
if
he
thought
it
smart
and
a
good
joke
what
sorrow
and
anxiety
his
poor
mother
is
no
doubt
suffering
cash
neelie
sim
buford
ezra
frank
winthrop
and
i
while
waiting
in
platsmouth
went
to
a
and
had
our
pictures
taken
tintype
of
course
all
in
one
group
then
each
one
alone
then
sim
and
neelie
together
and
cash
and
i
on
our
ponies
we
only
came
five
miles
after
our
rush
to
get
an
early
start
there
are
nine
families
and
fifteen
wagons
in
our
train
now
miss
mary
gatewood
has
a
pony
for
her
especial
use
so
there
will
be
four
of
us
to
ride
horseback
there
are
enough
wagons
now
to
make
quite
a
respectable
corral
i
did
suppose
as
we
had
been
resting
so
long
we
would
make
a
long
drive
feed
for
the
stock
is
very
good
here
and
as
it
is
fifteen
miles
to
the
next
good
camping
place
where
there
is
plenty
of
water
and
feed
it
has
been
decided
that
we
stay
here
until
the
boys
have
put
up
the
inevitable
swing
and
we
have
concluded
what
can
not
be
cured
must
be
so
we
will
make
the
best
of
it
but
certainly
at
this
rate
we
will
not
reach
our
destination
before
it
is
cold
weather
thursday
may
oh
dear
here
we
are
yet
only
five
miles
from
platsmouth
morrison
and
harding
have
lost
two
fine
cows
half
a
dozen
men
have
been
hunting
them
all
day
but
without
success
there
is
not
a
doubt
but
that
they
have
been
stolen
our
stock
will
have
to
be
herded
hereafter
to
guard
against
thieves
we
have
spent
the
day
reading
writing
sleeping
swinging
and
getting
acquainted
with
our
neighbors
the
morrison
family
wagon
is
just
in
front
of
us
and
the
just
behind
so
we
are
to
have
the
most
pleasant
neighbors
possible
to
camp
next
to
us
morrison
is
almost
as
pretty
as
cash
although
the
mother
of
four
children
she
is
so
bright
and
cheerful
so
full
of
life
and
fun
she
will
be
great
on
a
trip
like
this
morrison
has
an
impediment
in
his
speech
and
when
he
is
excited
like
he
is
this
evening
because
they
can
not
find
their
cows
he
stutters
dreadfully
and
will
say
sir
or
sir
or
sir
until
it
is
hard
to
keep
from
laughing
in
ordinary
conversation
and
when
not
excited
he
talks
as
straight
as
any
one
he
seems
so
fond
and
proud
of
his
wife
and
children
i
like
him
neelie
and
sim
and
frank
and
i
took
a
stroll
this
afternoon
in
search
of
wild
flowers
they
are
few
and
far
between
yet
we
enjoyed
the
walk
through
the
woods
in
this
lovely
springtime
weather
a
yankee
homestead
friday
may
we
came
fifteen
miles
are
camping
on
a
high
rolling
prairie
not
a
tree
or
shrub
within
sight
we
are
near
a
neat
white
farmhouse
everything
seems
to
be
very
new
but
does
not
have
that
and
a
appearance
that
so
many
farmhouses
in
nebraska
have
things
seem
to
be
shipshape
the
house
completed
and
nicely
painted
a
new
and
everything
on
the
place
barns
all
seem
well
built
as
if
the
owners
are
expecting
to
make
a
permanent
home
i
would
prefer
a
home
not
quite
so
isolated
and
far
away
from
anywhere
there
do
not
seem
to
be
any
women
about
the
place
perhaps
they
are
coming
when
everything
is
ready
for
their
comfort
saturday
may
we
came
to
ashland
on
salt
river
only
a
drive
got
here
soon
after
noon
and
will
stay
over
sunday
several
of
us
young
folks
went
fishing
this
afternoon
i
have
often
gone
fishing
but
do
not
remember
ever
catching
anything
of
any
consequence
or
having
any
luck
as
the
boys
say
so
imagine
my
excitement
and
surprise
when
the
fish
began
to
bite
and
i
drew
them
out
almost
as
fast
as
i
could
get
my
hook
baited
frank
baited
my
hook
and
strung
the
fish
on
a
forked
willow
switch
after
i
had
caught
six
or
eight
they
seem
so
dry
and
miserable
i
thought
they
would
feel
better
in
the
water
so
stuck
the
willow
in
the
bank
so
that
the
fish
were
in
shallow
water
i
caught
another
fish
and
went
to
put
it
with
the
others
when
lo
they
were
all
gone
i
could
have
cried
and
the
rest
all
laughed
well
i
shall
try
again
after
securing
the
one
i
had
and
leaving
it
on
dry
ground
i
threw
in
my
hook
and
almost
immediately
i
had
caught
something
so
large
and
heavy
i
could
not
draw
it
out
and
had
to
call
for
assistance
i
was
fearful
it
was
a
or
something
else
than
a
fish
but
it
proved
to
be
a
fine
large
fish
larger
than
all
the
small
fish
i
had
lost
put
together
when
frank
had
taken
it
from
the
hook
and
strung
it
with
the
little
one
i
said
i
am
going
before
this
fish
gets
all
had
fairly
good
catches
but
none
that
compared
with
my
big
fish
there
are
about
twenty
corrals
within
sight
each
of
from
twelve
to
twenty
wagons
ashland
is
a
miserable
looking
place
the
houses
with
dirt
roofs
one
store
where
groceries
and
whiskey
are
sold
and
a
blacksmith
shop
are
all
the
business
houses
i
do
not
see
anything
that
would
pass
muster
as
a
hotel
sunday
may
all
the
trains
that
camped
near
us
last
night
except
one
have
gone
on
their
way
sunday
though
it
is
i
am
glad
there
are
some
people
going
west
who
regard
the
sabbath
day
some
of
our
young
people
went
fishing
and
some
went
rowing
on
the
river
in
a
canoe
or
small
boat
the
boys
hired
it
has
been
a
day
of
sweet
rest
a
quiet
peaceful
sabbath
monday
may
traveled
all
day
and
made
a
long
drive
without
meeting
anyone
or
passing
a
single
habitation
we
are
camping
near
what
the
people
west
of
the
missouri
river
call
a
ranch
there
is
a
long
low
with
dirt
roof
a
corral
or
inclosure
for
stock
with
very
high
fence
and
two
or
three
wells
of
water
in
the
vicinity
and
that
is
all
no
vegetable
garden
no
fields
of
grain
nor
anything
to
make
it
look
like
farming
i
think
it
is
a
and
the
people
who
occupy
do
not
expect
to
stay
very
long
there
are
three
other
camps
near
the
people
of
the
other
trains
are
having
an
emigrant
ball
or
dance
in
a
room
they
have
hired
they
sent
a
committee
with
a
polite
invitation
to
our
camp
for
us
to
join
them
which
was
as
politely
declined
they
are
strangers
and
the
conduct
of
some
of
the
women
is
not
ladylike
to
say
the
least
we
meet
a
friend
tuesday
may
we
girls
were
riding
in
advance
of
the
wagons
when
we
saw
a
long
freight
train
coming
we
stopped
to
let
our
ponies
graze
until
they
would
pass
i
glanced
at
the
driver
on
the
second
wagon
and
recognized
an
acquaintance
girls
that
is
kid
short
i
exclaimed
he
looked
at
me
so
funny
and
began
to
scramble
down
from
his
high
perch
miss
sallie
i
could
not
believe
my
eyes
at
first
where
did
you
drop
from
shaking
hands
with
each
of
us
drop
from
anywhere
have
been
thirty
days
getting
here
by
the
slow
pace
of
an
sim
buford
and
some
more
boys
that
you
know
are
with
the
train
you
see
he
soon
said
to
us
spoke
to
a
man
on
horseback
who
dismounted
gave
him
his
horse
and
climbed
to
the
seat
short
had
vacated
in
the
front
of
the
freight
wagon
drawn
by
eight
mules
while
kid
hurried
off
to
see
the
boys
he
and
sim
have
been
neighbors
schoolmates
and
intimate
friends
all
their
lives
sim
says
kid
is
homesick
and
expects
to
go
home
as
soon
as
he
can
after
reaching
omaha
he
has
been
freighting
from
omaha
to
kearney
and
has
been
away
from
home
since
last
fall
we
are
camping
near
another
station
with
the
same
trains
we
camped
near
last
night
not
far
off
wednesday
may
we
are
camping
in
the
valley
of
the
platte
we
are
obliged
to
stop
at
the
to
get
water
for
ourselves
and
the
stock
from
the
wells
the
water
is
very
good
clear
and
cold
the
same
trains
that
have
been
camping
near
us
since
we
left
ashland
are
here
again
two
of
the
women
called
upon
us
awhile
ago
we
were
not
favorably
impressed
they
are
loud
boisterous
and
unladylike
they
speak
to
strange
gentlemen
with
all
the
familiarity
of
old
acquaintances
according
to
thackeray
they
are
kind
of
women
thursday
june
our
little
village
on
wheels
has
stopped
near
a
large
that
was
built
in
the
early
fifties
for
a
wayside
tavern
there
are
fifteen
rooms
there
are
frightful
stories
told
of
dark
deeds
having
been
committed
under
that
roof
of
unwary
travelers
homeward
bound
from
california
that
never
reached
home
but
whether
true
or
not
i
can
not
say
the
people
of
the
other
trains
are
having
a
dance
in
the
large
of
the
old
house
friday
june
as
ezra
and
i
were
riding
in
front
of
the
train
we
came
to
where
a
man
was
sitting
on
the
ground
hugging
his
knees
two
men
were
standing
near
trying
to
talk
to
him
seemingly
as
we
rode
up
one
of
them
came
toward
us
saying
is
an
indian
over
we
rode
close
to
him
and
ezra
said
but
he
did
not
even
grunt
he
was
very
disappointing
as
the
red
we
read
about
he
wore
an
old
ragged
federal
suit
cap
and
all
there
were
no
feathers
beads
nor
blankets
he
was
not
black
like
a
negro
more
of
a
brown
and
a
different
shade
from
the
mulatto
he
was
ugly
as
sin
on
the
banks
of
the
platte
saturday
june
here
we
are
on
the
platte
with
about
two
hundred
wagons
in
sight
we
are
now
on
what
is
known
as
my
idea
of
the
plains
has
been
very
erroneous
for
i
thought
they
were
one
continuous
level
or
plain
as
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
no
hills
nor
hollows
but
it
is
nothing
else
than
the
platte
river
valley
with
high
bluffs
on
either
side
there
is
some
timber
on
the
banks
but
the
timber
of
any
consequence
is
on
the
islands
in
the
middle
of
the
river
out
of
reach
of
the
axe
of
the
emigrant
this
is
the
junction
of
the
roads
from
joe
and
plattsmouth
and
that
is
why
there
are
so
many
wagons
here
surely
among
all
these
people
there
must
be
a
minister
of
the
gospel
so
perhaps
we
will
have
public
worship
our
trip
grows
more
interesting
even
kerfoot
seems
interested
as
so
many
people
are
going
west
it
must
be
the
thing
to
do
sunday
june
we
are
organized
into
a
company
of
wagons
a
captain
and
orderly
sergeant
have
been
elected
and
hereafter
we
will
travel
by
system
hardinbrooke
is
our
captain
he
has
gone
on
this
trip
before
he
is
taking
his
wife
and
little
girl
with
him
to
montana
a
davis
is
our
orderly
sergeant
we
are
now
coming
into
a
country
infested
with
indians
so
it
is
required
by
government
officials
that
all
emigrants
must
organize
into
companies
of
from
forty
to
sixty
wagons
elect
captains
and
try
to
camp
near
each
other
for
mutual
protection
the
grass
for
stock
is
unlimited
about
twenty
of
the
wagons
in
our
train
are
freight
wagons
belonging
to
the
walker
brothers
joe
and
milt
joe
has
his
wife
with
him
milt
is
a
bachelor
their
sister
miss
lyde
and
a
younger
brother
de
are
with
them
they
are
going
to
montana
we
have
been
introduced
to
and
hardinbrooke
and
to
the
walkers
and
their
ladies
they
are
pleasant
intelligent
people
and
will
add
much
to
the
pleasure
of
our
party
no
doubt
frank
and
i
went
horseback
riding
this
afternoon
to
the
station
to
get
some
good
water
from
the
well
i
can
not
drink
the
river
water
no
public
worship
although
there
were
so
many
of
us
here
monday
june
we
were
awakened
at
an
early
hour
this
morning
with
a
bugle
call
three
companies
were
organized
yesterday
there
were
about
twenty
wagons
that
were
not
asked
to
join
either
party
so
they
pulled
up
stakes
and
left
while
frank
and
i
were
away
the
strange
women
were
of
the
party
they
must
be
some
miles
ahead
by
this
time
and
i
hope
they
will
stay
ahead
when
our
long
train
of
wagons
are
stretched
out
upon
the
road
we
make
a
formidable
looking
outfit
for
the
indians
to
attack
as
far
as
the
eye
can
reach
before
us
and
behind
us
there
are
wagons
wagons
wagons
some
drawn
by
oxen
some
by
mules
and
some
by
horses
all
fall
into
the
slow
sure
gait
of
the
oxen
there
are
whole
freight
trains
drawn
by
oxen
there
are
more
ox
teams
than
all
others
after
our
evening
meal
a
number
of
us
started
for
a
stroll
along
the
bank
of
the
river
before
we
reached
the
river
we
were
met
by
a
perfect
cloud
of
mosquitoes
that
literally
drove
us
back
i
never
came
so
near
being
eaten
up
there
is
a
strong
breeze
blowing
toward
the
river
which
keeps
them
from
invading
the
camps
for
which
i
am
thankful
otherwise
there
would
be
little
rest
or
sleep
for
us
they
are
the
first
mosquitoes
we
have
seen
on
the
road
tuesday
june
it
is
sweet
to
be
awakened
with
music
if
it
is
only
a
bugle
our
bugle
certainly
makes
sweet
music
the
road
is
becoming
very
dry
and
dusty
which
makes
riding
in
the
wagon
rather
disagreeable
sometimes
mother
and
i
take
turns
driving
the
horses
and
riding
dick
rather
the
most
of
the
time
i
ride
dick
one
of
our
boys
goes
out
with
the
herders
at
night
so
one
of
them
is
generally
sleepy
and
sleeps
during
the
day
while
the
other
drives
the
the
order
of
our
going
wednesday
june
there
is
such
a
sameness
in
our
surroundings
that
we
seem
to
be
stopping
in
the
same
place
every
night
with
the
same
neighbors
in
front
and
back
of
us
and
across
the
corral
when
we
organized
wagons
were
driven
just
in
front
of
ours
and
just
behind
ours
so
we
have
the
same
neighbors
only
they
have
changed
places
we
are
in
the
central
part
of
the
side
of
the
corral
the
wagons
occupied
by
the
walkers
and
hardinbrookes
are
just
opposite
in
the
side
of
the
corral
we
always
stop
in
just
this
way
if
only
for
an
hour
at
noon
which
we
do
every
day
for
lunch
and
to
water
the
stock
when
we
halted
the
rain
began
to
pour
the
stock
scattered
in
every
direction
when
it
stopped
raining
the
cattle
could
not
all
be
found
in
time
to
start
again
this
afternoon
so
we
only
made
half
a
drive
it
has
commenced
raining
again
and
promises
a
rainy
night
it
is
not
very
pleasant
camping
when
it
rains
yet
it
would
be
much
more
unpleasant
if
it
did
not
rain
to
lay
the
dust
refresh
the
atmosphere
and
make
the
grass
grow
when
the
captain
finds
a
place
for
the
corral
he
rides
out
where
all
can
see
him
and
gives
the
signal
the
first
and
central
wagons
leave
the
road
the
first
to
drive
to
where
the
captain
stands
the
other
and
all
behind
it
cross
over
a
sufficient
distance
to
form
the
corral
by
the
wagons
stopping
so
as
to
form
a
gateway
for
the
stock
to
pass
through
turned
so
that
they
will
not
interfere
with
each
other
when
hitching
the
next
wagon
drives
to
position
with
the
side
of
cover
almost
touching
the
or
back
outer
edge
of
the
wagon
in
front
with
tongues
of
wagons
turned
out
so
that
all
can
be
hitched
to
at
one
time
in
this
way
the
entire
corral
is
formed
meeting
at
the
back
an
oblong
circle
forming
a
wall
or
barrier
the
cattle
can
not
break
through
the
horses
are
caught
and
harnessed
outside
the
corral
but
the
cattle
have
to
be
driven
inside
to
be
yoked
thursday
june
it
rained
all
night
seemingly
without
cessation
the
wind
did
not
blow
so
there
was
no
harm
but
lots
of
good
done
i
am
glad
when
the
rain
comes
in
the
instead
of
where
the
beds
touched
the
covers
they
were
quite
wet
this
morning
friday
june
we
came
through
a
little
town
valley
city
there
is
a
very
pretty
attractive
looking
house
near
the
road
cash
and
i
had
come
on
ahead
of
wagons
our
inclination
to
enter
that
pretty
home
was
irresistible
so
we
dismounted
took
off
our
habits
hitched
our
ponies
and
knocked
at
the
door
a
very
pleasant
lady
opened
the
door
and
gave
us
hearty
welcome
we
told
her
frankly
why
we
came
she
laughed
and
said
have
had
callers
before
with
the
same
excuse
but
you
need
not
apologize
i
am
glad
my
home
is
attractive
to
the
gentleman
of
the
house
is
postmaster
and
has
his
office
in
the
room
across
the
hall
from
the
parlor
while
we
were
there
the
coach
arrived
and
the
mail
was
brought
in
he
did
not
know
we
were
there
and
called
to
his
wife
to
see
this
we
went
with
her
and
oh
such
a
mess
they
had
emptied
the
on
some
papers
that
had
been
spread
upon
the
floor
and
such
a
lot
of
dilapidated
letters
and
papers
i
never
saw
before
i
picked
up
a
photograph
of
an
elderly
lady
but
we
could
not
find
the
envelope
from
which
it
had
escaped
perhaps
some
anxious
son
away
out
in
the
mines
far
from
home
and
friends
and
mother
will
look
in
vain
for
pictured
face
and
be
so
sadly
disappointed
i
am
so
sorry
for
the
boy
that
will
miss
getting
his
photograph
she
looks
like
such
a
sweet
motherly
mother
a
great
many
of
the
letters
were
past
saving
if
the
owners
had
been
there
they
could
not
have
deciphered
either
the
address
or
the
written
contents
for
they
were
only
a
mass
of
pulp
the
postmaster
said
it
was
they
send
such
old
leaky
on
this
route
those
folk
seem
to
think
any
old
thing
will
do
for
the
west
when
we
ought
to
have
the
very
best
and
strongest
because
of
the
long
distances
they
must
be
all
that
could
be
were
carefully
handled
and
spread
out
to
dry
still
they
would
reach
their
destination
in
a
very
dilapidated
condition
we
have
made
a
long
drive
are
within
four
miles
of
fort
kearney
there
are
a
great
many
wagons
within
sight
besides
our
own
long
train
whichever
way
we
look
we
can
see
wagons
the
road
from
kansas
city
comes
into
this
road
not
far
from
valley
city
and
there
are
as
many
or
more
coming
that
way
as
the
way
we
came
people
leaving
missouri
no
doubt
i
have
never
seen
a
fort
i
do
hope
kearney
will
come
up
to
my
expectations
fort
kearney
saturday
june
i
was
disappointed
in
fort
kearney
as
i
so
often
am
in
things
i
have
formed
an
idea
about
there
are
very
comfortable
quarters
for
the
soldiers
they
have
set
out
trees
and
made
it
quite
a
pretty
place
away
out
here
in
the
wilderness
but
there
is
no
stockade
or
place
of
defense
with
mounted
cannon
as
i
had
expected
sim
and
i
rode
horseback
through
the
fort
while
the
wagons
kept
the
road
half
a
mile
north
of
the
fort
only
a
few
of
us
came
by
the
way
of
the
fort
a
soldier
gave
us
a
drink
of
water
from
a
well
by
the
wayside
he
seemed
a
perfect
gentleman
but
had
such
a
sad
expression
we
were
told
that
these
soldiers
were
in
the
confederate
service
were
taken
prisoners
confined
at
rock
island
and
enlisted
in
the
government
service
to
come
out
here
and
fight
indians
they
are
from
georgia
and
alabama
two
families
have
joined
our
train
and
come
into
corral
on
the
opposite
side
just
behind
the
walkers
and
kennedy
a
couple
and
and
bower
with
a
daughter
fourteen
and
a
son
five
we
only
came
one
and
a
half
miles
west
of
the
fort
near
kearney
city
i
do
not
understand
why
we
have
made
such
a
short
drive
for
the
boys
say
the
feed
is
not
good
it
has
been
eaten
off
so
close
sunday
june
we
were
obliged
to
leave
camp
and
travel
the
first
sunday
we
have
hitched
up
since
we
started
it
was
a
case
of
necessity
as
there
was
not
feed
for
our
large
herds
of
cattle
and
horses
we
made
only
a
short
drive
just
to
get
good
feed
for
the
stock
we
are
camping
near
a
station
that
must
seem
like
a
military
post
there
are
so
many
soldiers
several
soldiers
came
to
our
camp
this
afternoon
they
confirmed
what
we
heard
yesterday
they
are
confederate
soldiers
they
were
prisoners
and
their
homes
are
in
georgia
and
alabama
and
they
are
desperately
homesick
it
is
a
distressing
sickness
i
have
been
so
homesick
that
i
could
not
eat
or
sleep
and
a
cure
was
not
effected
until
i
was
at
home
again
then
how
nice
it
did
seem
to
be
home
and
how
good
everything
tasted
i
do
hope
this
cruel
homicidal
war
will
soon
be
over
and
these
southern
gentlemen
will
be
permitted
to
go
to
their
homes
and
loved
ones
who
no
doubt
are
waiting
and
longing
for
their
return
my
heart
aches
for
them
eleven
graves
monday
june
we
stood
by
the
graves
of
eleven
men
that
were
killed
last
august
by
the
indians
there
was
a
sort
of
about
midway
and
at
the
foot
of
the
graves
stating
the
circumstances
of
the
frightful
tragedy
they
were
a
party
of
fourteen
twelve
men
and
two
women
wives
of
two
of
the
men
they
were
camped
on
plum
creek
a
short
distance
from
where
the
graves
are
they
were
all
at
breakfast
except
one
man
who
had
gone
to
the
creek
for
water
he
hid
in
the
brush
or
there
would
have
been
none
to
tell
the
tale
of
the
massacre
there
had
been
no
depredations
committed
on
this
road
all
summer
and
emigrants
had
become
careless
and
traveled
in
small
parties
they
did
not
suspect
that
an
indian
was
near
until
they
were
surrounded
and
the
slaughter
had
commenced
all
the
men
were
killed
and
scalped
and
the
women
taken
prisoners
they
took
what
they
wanted
of
the
provisions
burned
the
wagons
and
ran
off
with
the
horses
the
one
man
that
escaped
went
with
all
haste
to
the
nearest
station
for
help
the
soldiers
pursued
the
indians
had
a
fight
with
them
and
rescued
the
women
one
of
them
had
seen
her
husband
killed
and
scalped
and
was
insane
when
rescued
and
died
at
the
station
the
other
woman
was
the
wife
of
the
man
that
escaped
they
were
from
joe
missouri
ezra
met
with
quite
an
accident
he
went
to
sleep
while
driving
the
family
wagon
he
was
on
guard
last
night
the
horses
brought
the
wheel
against
a
telegraph
pole
with
a
sudden
jerk
that
threw
him
out
of
his
seat
and
down
at
the
heels
a
sudden
awakening
with
a
ankle
we
are
in
the
worst
place
for
indians
on
all
this
road
the
bluffs
come
within
half
a
mile
on
our
left
and
hundreds
of
savages
could
hide
in
the
hollows
the
underbrush
and
willows
are
dense
along
the
river
banks
there
is
an
island
about
a
mile
in
length
that
comes
so
near
this
side
in
many
places
that
a
man
could
leap
from
bank
to
bank
the
island
is
a
thick
wood
a
place
where
any
number
of
the
dreaded
savages
could
hide
and
shoot
down
the
unwary
traveler
with
the
guns
and
ammunition
furnished
them
by
the
united
states
government
how
i
would
like
to
climb
to
the
top
of
those
bluffs
and
see
what
is
on
the
other
side
but
the
captain
says
within
sight
of
and
i
must
obey
a
narrow
escape
tuesday
june
cash
neelie
and
i
created
quite
a
sensation
this
morning
we
waited
after
the
train
had
started
to
mount
our
ponies
as
we
usually
do
cash
and
i
had
mounted
but
neelie
led
her
pony
and
we
went
down
to
the
river
to
water
them
neelie
found
some
beautiful
wild
flowers
and
she
insisted
upon
gathering
them
of
course
we
waited
for
her
the
train
was
winding
round
a
bend
in
the
road
and
the
last
wagons
would
soon
be
out
of
sight
we
insisted
that
she
must
come
train
will
be
out
of
sight
in
five
minutes
and
we
may
be
cut
off
by
savages
in
she
did
not
scare
worth
a
cent
she
led
her
pony
into
a
little
hollow
to
mount
when
we
saw
two
men
coming
toward
us
as
fast
as
they
could
ride
cash
rode
at
an
easy
canter
to
meet
them
while
i
waited
for
neelie
who
was
deliberately
arranging
her
flowers
so
that
she
would
not
crush
them
men
are
coming
after
us
perhaps
there
are
indians
she
took
her
time
just
the
same
when
the
captain
saw
that
the
train
would
soon
be
out
of
our
sight
he
went
to
morrison
who
was
on
horseback
and
said
quietly
back
and
warn
those
girls
of
their
danger
there
are
indians
around
they
have
been
seen
by
the
guard
on
the
island
and
by
the
herders
in
the
hollows
of
the
bluffs
this
morning
they
would
not
be
safe
one
minute
after
the
train
is
out
of
they
had
kept
it
quiet
as
they
did
not
wish
to
cause
unnecessary
alarm
for
they
knew
there
was
no
danger
for
the
indians
knew
they
were
being
watched
and
besides
we
are
too
many
for
them
morrison
started
but
not
quietly
he
snatched
off
his
hat
whipping
his
horse
with
it
passed
wagon
as
fast
as
his
horse
could
go
kerfoot
asked
is
the
matter
some
one
said
he
wound
the
lines
round
the
leaped
from
his
high
seat
on
the
front
of
the
wagon
grabbed
the
first
horse
in
reach
snatched
boy
out
of
the
saddle
jumped
on
the
horse
and
came
tearing
toward
us
lashing
the
horse
with
his
long
whip
his
hat
flew
off
soon
after
he
started
but
he
did
not
know
it
he
passed
morrison
and
meeting
cash
he
stopped
long
enough
to
bring
his
whip
over
her
haunches
with
all
his
might
and
sent
her
flying
toward
the
train
he
next
met
me
for
i
started
when
i
saw
them
coming
and
was
perhaps
a
hundreds
yards
ahead
of
neelie
and
stopped
and
said
sallie
do
you
know
that
we
are
in
the
very
worst
indian
country
there
is
on
this
road
he
did
not
wait
for
a
reply
but
went
on
to
neelie
who
was
looking
all
about
to
see
the
indians
he
gave
her
pony
a
cut
with
his
whip
as
he
had
and
we
went
flying
over
the
ground
merry
laughter
pealing
forth
kerfoot
did
not
speak
to
either
of
us
morrison
had
turned
back
with
cash
and
scolded
all
the
way
she
said
he
stuttered
and
stuttered
until
she
had
hard
work
to
keep
from
laughing
the
captain
had
stopped
the
train
and
we
were
greeted
with
loud
cheering
and
hurrahs
there
was
considerable
joking
about
our
being
anxious
for
an
adventure
and
the
young
men
were
profuse
in
their
declarations
about
what
they
would
have
done
if
we
had
been
captured
by
the
indians
every
one
laughed
about
our
escape
as
they
called
it
except
kerfoot
he
was
pale
and
trembling
it
is
a
shame
that
he
should
have
been
so
unnecessarily
frightened
by
our
thoughtlessness
and
i
believe
he
thinks
it
was
my
fault
i
wonder
what
he
would
have
thought
if
i
had
left
neelie
to
come
alone
wednesday
june
one
of
the
men
found
the
skull
of
a
human
being
while
we
were
stopping
at
noon
it
seems
horrible
to
think
of
bones
being
scattered
about
in
such
manner
there
is
a
storm
coming
a
storm
on
the
plains
is
something
to
be
dreaded
especially
a
old
men
who
have
been
freighting
across
the
plains
for
years
say
they
have
seen
wagons
upset
with
three
tons
of
freight
in
a
i
am
more
afraid
of
a
than
of
indians
the
boys
say
i
am
not
afraid
of
indians
at
all
thursday
june
the
storm
came
with
great
violence
last
evening
we
saw
it
coming
in
time
to
be
prepared
for
it
so
there
was
no
damage
done
the
rain
came
down
in
torrents
and
made
the
roads
as
hard
and
smooth
as
a
floor
not
any
mud
it
has
been
fine
for
horseback
riding
everything
seems
so
fresh
and
clean
and
pure
and
not
too
warm
milt
walker
joined
us
about
an
hour
before
camping
time
he
seems
a
very
pleasant
gentleman
friday
june
we
had
a
storm
last
night
much
more
terrific
than
the
night
of
the
yet
there
was
no
harm
done
more
than
to
frighten
some
of
the
women
and
children
for
my
part
i
enjoyed
the
coming
of
the
storm
exceedingly
i
never
witnessed
a
so
sublimely
grand
oh
for
the
pen
of
an
artist
that
i
might
picture
the
majesty
and
grandeur
of
the
coming
of
that
storm
beaux
nellie
bower
has
a
pony
and
rides
with
us
sometimes
she
is
a
very
mature
young
lady
for
her
age
and
very
pleasant
company
neelie
and
i
were
riding
together
this
morning
while
cash
and
nellie
bower
rode
a
short
distance
ahead
we
had
been
on
the
road
about
half
an
hour
when
fletcher
and
milt
walker
rode
up
requesting
the
pleasure
of
our
company
in
a
very
formal
manner
of
course
we
smilingly
bowed
assent
and
the
doctor
rode
with
neelie
and
milt
with
me
it
is
the
first
time
there
has
been
any
formality
in
our
pairing
off
while
riding
the
boys
sometimes
ride
with
us
but
they
come
informally
we
ride
as
we
please
and
stop
and
climb
into
the
wagon
when
we
please
without
saying
by
your
leave
i
am
sorry
any
such
formality
has
been
commenced
for
when
i
want
to
lope
off
and
be
by
myself
i
want
to
feel
free
to
do
so
rather
than
to
be
constrained
to
entertain
a
beau
as
we
did
this
morning
of
course
fletcher
and
walker
have
not
gone
with
us
thus
informally
i
presume
we
succeeded
in
entertaining
them
for
when
the
train
turned
out
for
noon
each
gentleman
looked
at
his
watch
and
wondered
it
could
be
possible
it
is
noon
fletcher
is
stepbrother
of
the
walkers
his
mother
and
their
father
being
married
he
is
physician
for
our
train
an
intelligent
handsome
man
below
medium
in
size
i
think
he
must
be
dyspeptic
for
he
is
always
finding
fault
with
everything
he
seems
to
admire
neelie
very
much
we
came
through
cottonwood
this
morning
stopped
at
noon
where
the
feed
is
fine
so
it
has
been
decided
that
we
stay
here
until
the
sky
has
the
appearance
of
another
storm
this
evening
we
have
had
a
busy
afternoon
saturday
june
there
was
a
brisk
shower
last
evening
about
dark
only
lasted
about
half
an
hour
there
was
no
wind
about
midnight
the
cattle
stampeded
the
herders
do
not
know
what
frightened
them
but
the
first
thing
thought
of
was
indians
yet
there
were
none
visible
some
of
the
cattle
were
not
found
until
this
afternoon
so
here
we
will
have
to
stay
another
night
the
bluffs
near
here
are
quite
high
and
abrupt
i
climbed
to
the
top
this
morning
i
seemed
to
be
away
up
yonder
when
looking
down
at
our
corral
the
people
looked
like
midgets
the
bluffs
are
feet
high
i
received
a
beautiful
bouquet
of
wild
flowers
this
evening
but
do
not
know
who
sent
it
the
boy
said
gentleman
sent
but
he
either
could
not
or
would
not
tell
what
gentleman
perhaps
the
one
that
sent
it
thought
i
would
know
instinctively
but
i
am
certainly
in
the
dark
two
gentlemen
took
lunch
at
our
table
this
afternoon
they
are
father
and
son
hillhouse
met
them
out
on
the
road
they
asked
him
you
know
where
we
can
get
something
to
eat
we
have
had
nothing
since
a
very
early
he
brought
them
to
our
wagons
and
we
soon
had
a
lunch
ready
for
them
their
name
is
reade
the
hair
and
whiskers
are
as
white
as
snow
otherwise
he
is
not
an
man
they
asked
questions
and
when
they
found
we
had
not
fully
decided
upon
our
destination
they
insisted
that
montana
is
the
place
for
us
they
have
been
there
and
are
going
again
with
freight
they
belong
with
the
irvine
train
each
train
goes
by
the
name
of
its
captain
ours
is
known
as
hardinbrooke
then
there
is
the
mcmahan
train
and
the
dickerson
train
that
always
camp
within
sight
of
us
for
mutual
protection
we
have
not
met
any
of
the
people
from
the
other
trains
the
irvine
train
which
is
very
large
are
some
miles
ahead
of
us
the
reades
were
hunting
cattle
had
been
as
far
back
as
cottonwood
but
without
success
the
son
had
a
long
talk
with
the
boys
before
leaving
camp
after
he
had
gone
hillhouse
came
around
and
took
a
seat
on
the
near
where
i
was
engaged
in
the
interesting
occupation
of
the
mending
i
said
read
thinks
montana
the
place
for
we
decide
to
go
to
montana
so
do
the
walkers
and
hardinbrooke
and
morrison
and
everyone
else
that
are
going
to
why
not
go
there
do
not
like
for
you
and
mother
to
go
there
for
it
will
be
rough
living
i
expect
but
i
intend
to
go
as
soon
as
you
are
settled
somewhere
near
listen
to
the
boy
mother
come
here
for
five
minutes
do
what
do
you
think
this
boy
is
saying
that
he
is
going
to
montana
when
we
are
settled
in
california
or
some
other
if
he
is
going
to
montana
we
are
going
too
how
many
women
are
on
their
way
there
in
these
trains
i
reckon
it
will
not
be
any
worse
for
us
than
it
will
be
for
right
if
you
are
both
willing
to
go
to
montana
we
will
change
our
plans
accordingly
it
is
not
as
far
as
and
i
know
he
is
glad
so
it
was
settled
then
and
there
that
montana
will
be
our
destination
sunday
june
we
started
very
early
this
morning
as
soon
as
light
about
four
i
think
the
most
of
the
women
were
yet
in
bed
it
was
a
glorious
morning
and
i
did
so
enjoy
my
early
ride
on
dick
we
had
not
been
on
the
road
very
long
when
frank
joined
me
i
told
him
had
decided
to
go
to
he
was
silent
a
moment
then
said
is
the
place
to
go
i
do
hope
we
can
persuade
uncle
ezra
to
go
there
hope
he
will
decide
to
go
with
us
for
it
would
be
hard
to
part
with
all
of
you
now
it
would
seem
almost
like
leaving
home
we
halted
at
nine
had
breakfast
at
ten
started
again
at
twelve
stopped
again
at
four
and
are
camping
on
slough
monday
june
we
passed
two
graves
this
morning
that
have
been
made
within
a
month
the
first
a
man
who
shot
himself
accidentally
three
weeks
ago
the
other
a
woman
forty
years
old
who
died
one
month
ago
as
i
stood
beside
the
lonely
graves
i
thought
of
the
tears
that
had
been
shed
the
prayers
that
had
been
uttered
the
desolation
of
heart
that
had
been
endured
by
those
who
had
been
obliged
to
go
on
and
leave
their
loved
ones
here
in
this
wilderness
how
my
heart
ached
for
them
my
heart
went
out
in
thanksgiving
and
praise
to
our
heavenly
father
that
there
has
been
no
serious
sickness
in
all
these
trains
with
so
many
people
it
is
marvelous
we
are
camped
on
the
banks
of
the
south
platte
the
men
have
driven
the
stock
across
to
an
island
i
do
not
know
if
it
is
because
they
are
afraid
of
the
indians
stampeding
them
or
that
the
grass
is
better
if
there
should
be
danger
i
presume
they
would
not
tell
us
there
is
a
town
of
prairie
dogs
near
several
of
us
went
to
make
them
a
visit
but
the
boys
had
been
there
with
their
guns
shooting
at
the
little
things
and
frightened
them
so
they
would
not
come
out
although
we
waited
in
silence
until
almost
dark
i
shall
make
another
effort
to
see
them
very
early
in
the
morning
before
the
boys
are
awake
i
have
heard
they
are
early
risers
that
they
come
out
to
greet
the
rising
sun
we
met
an
acquaintance
will
musgrove
he
is
on
his
way
to
central
city
colorado
he
is
night
herder
for
a
freight
train
the
most
casual
acquaintance
seems
like
an
especial
friend
when
we
meet
away
out
here
so
far
from
home
or
anywhere
else
prairie
dogs
tuesday
june
winthrop
was
quite
sick
last
night
with
cramp
colic
i
was
up
with
him
the
latter
part
of
the
night
so
was
dressed
and
ready
for
my
visit
to
prairie
dog
town
at
an
early
hour
the
little
fellows
were
up
standing
at
their
doors
and
greeted
me
with
a
welcoming
bark
some
of
them
turned
and
darted
away
no
doubt
to
tell
others
we
had
come
for
they
immediately
came
back
to
peep
out
at
us
and
bark
and
chatter
as
if
carrying
on
a
lively
discussion
they
seemed
perfectly
fearless
as
long
as
we
kept
our
distance
but
if
we
tried
to
get
a
nearer
view
they
whisked
away
and
were
gone
in
an
instant
then
they
would
send
out
two
or
three
scouts
and
if
we
had
gone
far
enough
away
they
would
come
again
to
their
doors
they
have
been
well
described
by
many
writers
cash
and
frank
joined
me
while
at
prairie
dog
town
i
rode
horseback
this
morning
and
milt
walker
rode
with
me
winthrop
is
about
well
this
evening
his
was
the
first
sickness
we
have
had
will
musgrove
came
up
with
us
while
we
were
halted
for
noon
his
train
is
a
short
distance
behind
he
rode
with
me
in
the
wagon
all
afternoon
and
drove
the
horses
and
mother
rode
dick
we
had
a
long
talk
about
friends
at
home
he
took
dinner
with
us
and
then
said
and
we
will
see
him
no
more
for
we
will
travel
faster
than
the
freight
train
wednesday
june
and
morrison
are
cheerful
people
who
seem
to
be
always
happy
and
trying
to
make
others
happy
morrison
learned
that
miss
lyde
walker
has
her
guitar
and
sings
beautifully
so
she
invited
her
to
come
to
their
tent
and
help
to
entertain
a
few
friends
it
was
a
very
pleasant
diversion
while
lyde
was
singing
the
men
and
boys
from
all
over
the
corral
came
near
to
listen
when
she
sang
cottage
by
the
sea
both
inside
and
outside
the
tent
there
was
great
applause
that
terminated
in
an
encore
but
no
she
would
not
sing
any
more
she
murmured
something
about
the
rabble
and
laid
her
guitar
away
if
i
was
gifted
with
a
talent
with
which
i
could
give
pleasure
to
people
i
would
certainly
do
so
whenever
opportunity
was
afforded
i
would
be
glad
to
promote
the
happiness
and
dispel
as
much
sorrow
as
possible
in
this
sorrowful
world
thursday
june
we
came
through
a
place
called
star
ranch
or
old
california
crossing
we
are
camped
twelve
miles
below
julesburgh
reade
called
this
evening
we
told
him
we
had
decided
to
go
to
montana
he
seemed
as
pleased
as
though
personally
interested
says
the
irvine
train
is
only
half
a
mile
ahead
and
invited
us
to
go
with
him
to
call
upon
the
young
ladies
we
with
one
accord
asked
to
be
excused
we
all
felt
that
we
are
not
in
calling
costume
friday
june
we
are
camping
in
colorado
came
through
julesburgh
a
rather
place
to
have
such
notoriety
as
it
has
in
the
newspapers
we
met
a
company
of
soldiers
with
about
twenty
indian
prisoners
they
were
captured
at
fort
laramie
and
they
are
taking
them
to
fort
kearney
the
soldiers
had
a
fight
with
about
one
thousand
indians
three
weeks
ago
there
were
no
soldiers
killed
though
a
number
were
seriously
wounded
and
they
lost
a
good
many
horses
there
were
squaws
and
papooses
with
the
prisoners
though
not
captives
the
indians
in
the
fight
were
sioux
and
cheyennes
they
all
look
alike
to
me
they
were
the
most
human
creatures
i
ever
saw
nothing
majestic
dignified
or
about
any
of
the
indians
i
have
seen
an
soldier
gave
me
my
information
about
the
fight
there
are
a
great
many
southern
soldiers
on
this
route
we
passed
another
grave
this
afternoon
reade
called
this
evening
saturday
june
i
was
caught
in
a
this
morning
i
was
half
a
mile
from
the
wagons
on
a
high
bluff
looking
over
the
river
watching
the
storm
coming
i
did
not
realize
that
it
was
so
near
but
all
at
once
it
came
down
and
gave
me
some
pretty
hard
knocks
dick
seemed
in
a
hurry
to
get
to
the
train
and
i
let
him
go
we
seemed
to
fly
over
the
ground
through
the
storm
but
we
had
the
benefit
of
it
all
for
it
stopped
just
when
we
reached
the
wagons
i
unsaddled
dick
and
turned
him
out
while
i
took
passage
in
the
wagon
changed
my
wet
clothes
for
dry
ones
and
wrapped
in
a
shawl
to
keep
from
taking
cold
when
the
teams
were
being
hitched
up
at
noon
hillhouse
said
to
me
has
not
had
water
you
would
better
ride
to
the
river
and
give
him
a
the
river
was
half
a
mile
from
the
road
but
in
sight
all
the
way
dick
cantered
to
the
watering
place
drank
all
he
wanted
and
we
started
back
when
i
saw
someone
coming
toward
me
i
will
not
say
who
it
was
because
of
what
followed
thought
you
were
getting
too
far
behind
for
there
any
danger
you
need
not
bother
about
oh
and
then
came
a
declaration
that
about
took
my
breath
at
first
i
felt
that
i
would
like
to
box
the
presumptuous
ears
then
i
wanted
so
much
to
laugh
but
when
i
saw
how
desperately
in
earnest
he
was
i
thought
perhaps
i
have
been
to
blame
for
not
seeing
how
things
were
tending
i
was
perfectly
amazed
such
a
thought
never
occurred
to
me
our
ride
back
to
the
train
was
rather
embarrassing
to
me
i
tried
to
make
him
see
the
comicality
of
the
whole
business
but
he
would
not
see
it
we
passed
a
station
where
the
indians
had
burned
all
that
would
burn
but
these
adobe
houses
or
cabins
rather
would
not
make
much
of
a
blaze
i
imagine
inside
one
of
the
cabins
or
what
was
left
of
it
were
two
dead
indians
that
had
been
killed
in
the
fray
sunday
june
reade
came
with
six
young
ladies
to
call
upon
us
this
morning
also
one
gentleman
from
the
irvine
train
they
had
gone
down
into
their
trunks
and
were
dressed
in
civilization
costumes
they
were
misses
nannie
and
maggie
irvine
sisters
their
brother
tom
irvine
miss
mollie
irvine
a
cousin
miss
forbes
and
two
other
young
ladies
whose
names
i
have
forgotten
they
are
all
very
pleasant
intelligent
young
people
the
trains
are
keeping
as
close
together
as
possible
for
protection
for
the
indians
are
on
the
warpath
every
station
and
that
we
are
passing
these
days
have
been
destroyed
preaching
services
we
have
had
a
preaching
service
this
afternoon
rev
austin
of
the
church
south
the
church
that
i
am
a
member
of
was
the
preacher
the
services
were
well
attended
and
the
sermon
was
fine
he
compared
our
situation
with
that
of
children
of
in
the
wilderness
he
spoke
of
care
for
them
and
that
he
careth
for
us
spoke
in
an
earnest
manner
of
our
dependence
upon
god
and
our
inability
to
take
care
of
ourselves
or
to
accomplish
anything
without
help
and
and
of
the
necessity
of
earnest
prayer
and
faith
in
all
circumstances
of
life
and
always
to
remember
that
everlasting
arms
are
when
the
people
were
gathered
at
the
call
of
the
bugle
some
sat
on
chairs
in
the
shade
of
wagons
some
under
umbrellas
some
in
carriages
and
light
wagons
mother
and
i
stood
near
a
carriage
before
the
service
commenced
when
a
lady
invited
us
to
sit
with
her
and
her
children
a
little
boy
of
five
and
a
girl
of
three
we
accepted
and
were
introduced
to
yager
wife
of
the
physician
for
the
chilicothe
train
dickerson
captain
the
services
were
held
at
their
camp
yager
is
a
southern
methodist
too
rev
austin
is
a
member
of
the
chilicothe
train
i
am
glad
there
is
at
least
one
preacher
among
us
music
in
camp
monday
june
and
may
a
couple
that
came
into
our
train
at
the
junction
of
the
roads
are
both
musicians
several
of
our
young
men
have
fine
voices
and
with
guitar
and
violin
we
have
had
an
enjoyable
musicale
away
out
here
in
the
wilderness
if
the
indians
had
been
within
listening
distance
it
would
be
interesting
to
know
what
impression
the
music
made
upon
their
minds
as
hath
charms
the
music
this
evening
has
been
the
happiest
feature
of
the
day
for
i
have
had
to
ride
in
the
wagon
all
day
one
of
the
big
horses
went
lame
this
morning
so
dick
was
put
in
harness
and
the
dear
little
fellow
has
worked
all
day
he
looks
funny
beside
the
big
horse
the
harness
had
to
be
taken
up
to
the
last
holes
to
make
it
fit
him
i
would
not
enjoy
taking
this
trip
without
a
or
pony
to
ride
i
must
be
more
generous
hereafter
and
let
lyde
and
kennedy
and
other
ladies
that
have
no
horse
ride
dick
oftener
than
i
have
been
doing
i
have
not
fully
realized
how
very
tiresome
it
is
to
ride
in
the
wagon
all
day
and
day
after
day
i
have
always
supposed
that
good
water
would
be
very
scarce
on
this
road
we
have
not
found
it
so
there
are
always
from
one
to
three
wells
at
the
with
excellent
water
free
for
all
thanks
to
uncle
sam
for
this
provision
for
our
welfare
in
some
places
wood
is
very
scarce
and
must
be
hauled
long
distances
we
cooked
dinner
this
evening
with
wood
hauled
from
near
cottonwood
cedar
logs
are
fastened
under
the
wagons
lengthwise
between
the
wheels
as
there
are
no
stumps
or
rocks
in
the
road
they
carry
all
right
when
there
is
no
wood
to
pick
up
the
log
is
taken
down
a
piece
cut
off
and
split
up
for
use
it
is
surprising
with
what
a
little
bit
of
wood
one
can
cook
a
meal
on
these
stoves
tuesday
june
among
the
men
who
are
driving
for
the
walkers
is
an
eccentric
old
bachelor
named
fogy
he
is
very
bashful
when
in
the
presence
of
ladies
i
have
often
heard
it
said
that
men
can
not
drive
oxen
without
swearing
it
is
a
mistake
i
have
seen
a
whole
lot
of
on
this
trip
and
i
heard
the
first
profane
oath
since
we
left
the
missouri
river
it
would
have
been
funny
if
it
had
not
been
shocking
we
have
traveled
all
day
where
the
bluffs
come
close
to
the
river
the
road
is
very
uneven
little
hills
and
hollows
in
some
of
the
hollows
there
is
mud
fogy
admires
neelie
very
much
at
a
distance
of
course
we
often
hear
the
extravagant
compliments
he
pays
her
and
his
regrets
about
that
troublesome
soon
after
the
start
this
morning
neelie
and
i
rode
to
the
front
to
escape
the
dust
and
sand
that
were
flying
as
we
came
near
the
front
wagon
we
were
startled
by
hearing
a
terrific
oath
the
wagon
had
stuck
in
the
mud
and
would
of
course
stop
the
entire
train
fogy
was
the
driver
he
was
greatly
embarrassed
and
distressed
when
he
knew
we
had
heard
him
swear
and
stopped
stock
still
and
let
the
wheels
sink
into
the
mud
so
that
they
had
to
double
teams
to
get
them
out
he
afterward
told
some
of
the
boys
he
was
effectually
cured
of
swearing
that
he
never
felt
so
cheap
in
his
life
and
if
he
is
ever
tempted
to
swear
he
knows
the
remembrance
of
that
moment
will
check
him
we
had
a
refreshing
shower
about
two
that
laid
the
dust
cooled
the
air
and
made
everything
sweet
and
fresh
we
hoped
and
expected
to
have
a
pleasant
afternoon
after
the
rain
there
was
a
calm
not
a
little
tiny
breeze
or
breath
of
air
it
was
just
suffocating
and
then
came
a
cloud
of
that
almost
devoured
us
so
that
horseback
riding
was
an
impossibility
wednesday
june
cash
is
on
the
i
trust
it
will
not
prove
to
be
anything
serious
i
greatly
fear
family
are
destined
to
have
considerable
sickness
before
this
trip
is
ended
they
have
such
a
sameness
of
diet
and
it
is
so
poorly
cooked
i
fear
the
result
when
we
started
on
this
trip
not
one
member
of
the
family
had
ever
prepared
an
entire
meal
they
had
always
had
a
houseful
of
servants
to
cook
and
do
everything
else
for
them
the
first
two
or
three
weeks
neelie
and
her
mother
tried
to
learn
to
cook
and
mother
and
i
tried
to
teach
them
it
takes
great
patience
to
learn
to
bake
in
stoves
out
of
doors
they
heat
so
quickly
and
cool
just
as
suddenly
they
must
have
careful
attention
all
the
time
they
made
several
failures
baking
light
bread
and
giving
it
up
in
disgust
settled
down
to
biscuit
that
are
hard
as
when
cold
bacon
coffee
and
beans
when
we
stop
long
enough
to
cook
them
they
were
well
supplied
with
fruit
at
first
the
canned
fruit
was
so
easily
served
that
it
is
all
gone
they
have
dried
fruit
but
think
it
too
much
trouble
to
cook
neelie
does
the
cooking
with
some
assistance
from
her
father
such
as
getting
wood
making
fires
bringing
water
grinding
the
coffee
etc
henrietta
and
emma
the
next
younger
sisters
wash
the
dishes
it
is
no
small
undertaking
to
cook
for
a
family
of
twelve
i
do
not
blame
neelie
for
getting
tired
she
says
they
have
such
appetites
it
is
not
worth
while
to
tempt
them
with
extras
neelie
is
the
dearest
sweetest
most
unselfish
daughter
and
sister
it
seems
they
all
depend
upon
her
the
children
go
to
her
in
their
troubles
and
perplexities
her
father
and
mother
rely
upon
her
and
she
is
always
ready
to
do
what
she
can
for
any
and
everybody
that
needs
her
help
she
is
unselfishness
personified
the
wind
blew
so
all
afternoon
that
we
could
not
ride
horseback
the
roads
are
smooth
and
hard
as
asphalt
result
of
rain
yesterday
and
the
wind
fletcher
who
was
called
to
prescribe
for
cash
says
she
will
be
all
right
in
a
day
or
two
the
mountains
in
sight
thursday
june
we
could
see
the
mountains
as
the
sun
was
sinking
behind
them
they
were
plainly
visible
though
one
hundred
miles
away
it
does
not
seem
possible
they
are
so
far
away
peak
and
others
near
it
are
the
points
in
sight
they
look
very
much
as
i
have
imagined
mountains
would
appear
in
the
distance
walker
is
my
informant
as
to
names
of
places
distances
etc
he
has
been
over
the
road
and
seems
to
know
all
about
it
we
usually
ride
some
hours
in
company
each
day
so
i
have
fine
opportunities
for
asking
questions
and
he
seems
a
willing
instructor
he
never
broaches
the
sentimental
has
never
paid
me
a
compliment
in
words
i
am
glad
to
say
for
since
my
late
experience
i
would
hesitate
to
ride
with
him
were
he
not
the
sensible
man
that
he
is
we
crossed
a
small
stream
that
was
bridged
and
had
to
pay
fifty
cents
toll
for
each
wagon
the
ford
had
been
spoiled
or
we
could
have
crossed
without
the
bridge
friday
june
we
stopped
at
noon
where
the
road
forks
the
road
goes
to
denver
and
may
and
and
kirkland
and
children
took
the
road
as
they
are
going
to
denver
brother
george
goes
on
to
montana
on
horseback
he
will
leave
us
in
the
morning
and
depend
upon
reaching
stations
or
emigrant
camps
for
food
and
shelter
nights
i
do
hope
the
indians
will
not
get
his
scalp
we
have
been
feasting
on
antelope
the
first
that
any
of
our
party
have
killed
it
is
fine
much
better
than
venison
but
then
i
never
ate
venison
when
i
was
so
hungry
for
fresh
meat
we
do
get
so
tired
of
cured
meat
we
see
no
game
except
antelope
and
jack
rabbits
the
great
herds
of
buffalo
that
we
read
about
have
not
been
in
sight
as
yet
team
ran
away
this
afternoon
with
morrison
and
the
children
in
the
wagon
i
had
been
riding
with
them
since
noon
had
just
left
the
wagon
when
all
the
horse
teams
were
driven
out
of
ranks
and
down
to
the
river
for
water
the
lead
horses
took
fright
at
an
the
are
big
as
a
and
started
to
run
there
were
several
men
near
who
caught
and
stopped
them
just
as
the
forewheel
went
over
the
bank
of
the
river
harding
was
driving
he
tried
to
rein
them
away
from
the
river
but
they
were
right
on
the
verge
when
stopped
one
moment
more
and
there
would
have
been
a
serious
accident
morrison
did
not
scream
nor
try
to
jump
out
neither
did
she
allow
the
children
to
but
sat
quite
still
and
acted
like
the
sensible
woman
that
she
is
we
are
only
six
miles
below
the
crossing
of
the
south
platte
saturday
july
we
were
awakened
this
morning
at
the
first
peep
of
dawn
by
the
sound
of
the
bugle
call
soon
the
teams
were
hitched
corral
broken
and
we
were
journeying
to
the
crossing
of
the
river
where
we
were
driven
into
corral
again
while
we
were
getting
breakfast
the
men
were
raising
the
and
fixing
them
upon
blocks
as
high
as
the
wheels
and
binding
them
tight
with
ropes
to
the
coupling
poles
and
lower
parts
of
the
wagons
ready
to
ford
the
river
they
had
a
appearance
as
if
the
least
jolt
would
topple
them
over
some
of
the
women
were
very
nervous
about
riding
in
wagons
set
up
on
stilts
and
felt
quite
certain
somebody
would
be
drowned
wagons
were
crossing
when
we
drove
into
corral
of
course
we
had
to
wait
our
turn
first
come
first
served
some
enterprising
young
men
have
the
blocks
and
ropes
there
to
rent
at
a
very
reasonable
hire
too
for
they
might
have
asked
what
they
would
we
had
no
choice
but
to
use
them
the
river
is
half
a
mile
or
more
wide
about
half
way
over
there
is
a
large
freight
wagon
stuck
in
the
quicksand
just
below
the
track
of
the
wagons
it
has
been
there
since
yesterday
it
is
slowly
slowly
sinking
and
can
not
be
gotten
out
it
has
been
unloaded
and
left
to
its
fate
it
seems
a
signal
of
distress
to
warn
drivers
to
keep
farther
up
the
river
and
avoid
the
quicksands
i
drove
the
horse
team
over
and
hillhouse
rode
dick
and
directed
our
going
the
wagons
of
our
train
were
all
over
and
in
corral
by
two
without
accident
or
mishap
wagons
have
been
crossing
all
day
and
this
evening
we
are
a
considerable
town
of
tents
and
wagons
more
than
two
hundred
wagons
within
sight
on
the
north
side
of
the
south
platte
at
the
eastern
extremity
of
orchard
though
why
it
is
called
an
orchard
i
can
not
understand
for
there
is
certainly
no
fruit
neither
promise
of
fruit
about
it
mostly
and
cottonwood
i
think
our
corral
is
just
to
the
left
of
where
the
wagons
drive
out
and
near
the
bank
of
the
river
hillhouse
has
crossed
the
river
on
dick
at
least
twenty
times
he
seemed
to
know
just
how
to
help
and
has
been
in
constant
demand
so
he
and
dick
are
thoroughly
tired
out
we
will
stay
here
over
sunday
and
hope
to
have
religious
services
as
there
are
several
preachers
with
us
i
have
not
met
any
of
them
except
brother
austin
who
preached
for
us
last
sunday
cash
is
much
better
able
to
be
out
though
quite
pale
and
weak
the
mountains
looming
up
in
the
distance
seem
to
be
the
goal
to
which
we
are
tending
and
now
we
seem
to
make
some
progress
every
day
for
we
are
certainly
nearer
than
when
we
first
saw
them
on
the
of
june
before
they
came
in
sight
we
did
not
seem
to
make
any
progress
but
traveled
day
after
day
and
seemed
to
camp
at
night
always
in
the
same
place
there
was
such
a
sameness
in
the
landscape
in
the
early
morning
when
the
sun
shines
upon
the
mountains
the
effect
is
thrilling
they
seem
to
be
the
great
altars
of
earth
raised
up
to
heaven
for
the
morning
sacrifice
a
town
of
tents
and
wagons
sunday
july
it
is
wonderful
wonderful
to
behold
how
this
town
of
tents
and
wagons
has
sprung
up
since
yesterday
morning
when
there
was
no
sign
of
life
on
this
north
bank
of
the
south
platte
and
now
there
are
more
than
one
thousand
men
women
and
children
and
i
can
not
guess
how
many
wagons
and
tents
the
wagons
have
been
crossing
all
day
the
last
one
has
just
been
driven
into
corral
at
sunset
i
was
sitting
on
the
bank
of
the
river
watching
with
anxiety
the
wagons
as
they
ploughed
through
the
deep
waters
for
the
ford
has
washed
out
and
the
wagons
go
in
much
deeper
than
when
we
crossed
yesterday
when
a
gentleman
came
and
introduced
himself
as
howard
physician
for
the
mcmahan
train
he
said
raymond
i
have
known
you
by
sight
since
we
camped
at
kearney
and
now
as
i
have
an
errand
for
an
excuse
i
hope
to
become
better
i
could
not
imagine
what
his
errand
could
be
for
he
talked
of
other
matters
for
fifteen
minutes
or
more
then
said
raymond
i
have
been
directed
to
your
wagons
for
the
best
and
most
wholesome
bread
that
is
baked
on
this
road
captain
nephew
robert
southerland
has
been
very
sick
but
is
now
convalescing
and
needs
nutritious
and
wholesome
food
to
help
him
gain
strength
i
came
to
ask
you
for
a
piece
of
good
of
course
i
gave
him
a
loaf
and
said
get
more
when
that
is
he
thanked
me
profusely
there
has
been
no
serious
accident
nor
any
lives
lost
although
thousands
of
cattle
hundreds
of
horses
and
more
than
a
thousand
human
beings
have
crossed
the
river
since
yesterday
morning
oh
for
the
pen
of
a
dickens
to
describe
this
wonderful
scene
which
no
one
ever
has
or
ever
will
see
again
just
as
it
is
the
moon
is
at
the
full
and
shining
brightly
as
there
is
not
a
cloud
in
the
sky
the
do
not
glow
as
they
do
dark
nights
the
men
are
building
a
great
bonfire
in
the
middle
of
our
extemporaneous
town
we
worship
in
the
wilderness
there
is
to
be
a
praise
and
thanksgiving
service
for
our
safe
conduct
through
the
deep
waters
and
our
protection
from
the
indians
the
people
are
beginning
to
gather
near
the
bonfire
and
i
must
go
too
later
our
service
is
over
it
was
grand
the
singing
of
the
old
familiar
hymns
by
so
many
voices
spontaneously
was
inspiring
the
talks
by
five
or
six
ministers
of
different
denominations
were
full
of
love
for
the
master
and
brotherly
love
for
every
one
an
invitation
was
then
given
for
all
who
had
enlisted
in
the
service
of
the
master
to
come
forward
and
shake
hands
with
the
preachers
thus
testifying
for
christ
neelie
was
the
first
one
in
that
long
procession
to
give
her
hand
precious
girl
she
is
always
first
in
every
good
work
i
noticed
howard
in
line
and
i
also
noticed
that
reade
and
milt
walker
were
not
among
the
soldiers
of
the
cross
the
feed
for
stock
is
abundant
if
it
were
not
so
all
these
cattle
and
horses
could
not
find
pasture
monday
july
the
scenes
in
this
great
expanse
of
low
level
land
on
the
north
side
of
the
platte
in
the
early
hours
of
this
morning
is
hard
to
describe
corrals
and
camps
here
there
and
everywhere
cattle
and
horses
being
driven
into
corrals
to
be
harnessed
and
yoked
men
and
women
cooking
by
and
on
stoves
everybody
seemed
to
be
in
a
great
hurry
all
was
animation
and
life
men
riding
after
horses
oxen
and
mules
yelling
hallooing
and
calling
but
not
a
profane
oath
did
i
hear
among
so
many
children
we
rarely
ever
hear
a
child
cry
and
never
hear
a
woman
scold
our
train
was
the
third
to
break
camp
and
file
into
the
road
this
morning
the
place
that
knew
us
yesterday
will
know
us
no
more
forever
our
town
of
tents
and
wagons
that
was
teeming
with
life
this
morning
is
this
evening
deserted
silent
and
uninhabited
we
have
folded
our
tents
and
driven
or
rode
away
i
did
not
mount
immediately
but
led
dick
by
the
bridle
and
gathered
a
magnificent
bouquet
of
the
most
beautiful
wild
flowers
i
had
loitered
by
the
way
and
did
not
notice
that
i
was
getting
far
behind
our
train
when
i
looked
up
and
saw
only
strangers
in
the
train
that
was
passing
i
thought
it
was
time
to
mount
threw
the
bridle
over
head
while
arranging
my
flowers
so
that
i
would
not
crush
them
i
saw
a
gentleman
in
the
train
throw
down
his
whip
and
start
toward
me
as
if
to
assist
me
in
mounting
i
waited
until
he
was
quite
near
then
placing
a
hand
on
either
horn
i
sprang
lightly
into
the
saddle
turned
and
waved
my
bouquet
toward
him
as
dick
galloped
off
such
a
cheer
as
the
men
in
the
train
did
raise
and
then
such
merry
laughter
it
was
fun
to
hear
them
howard
says
it
was
colonel
woolfolk
a
gallant
young
widower
and
the
men
that
witnessed
it
guyed
him
unmercifully
on
having
been
snubbed
we
came
to
the
western
extremity
of
orchard
ten
miles
and
stopped
for
lunch
then
came
the
sand
hills
where
all
the
heaviest
wagons
had
to
double
teams
to
get
through
the
captain
came
on
four
miles
and
selected
a
camping
ground
and
we
drove
to
our
places
to
wait
for
the
heavy
wagons
to
get
through
the
sand
hillhouse
and
several
others
who
came
on
with
us
went
hunting
for
antelope
we
have
been
feasting
on
antelope
for
several
days
it
is
fine
but
if
i
could
have
my
choice
i
would
rather
live
on
ham
and
bacon
all
the
while
than
to
have
our
men
go
hunting
in
this
indian
country
since
we
have
crossed
the
platte
we
have
no
protection
from
the
soldiers
as
there
are
no
stations
on
this
side
the
river
we
suffer
agony
when
our
boys
are
away
from
camp
guarding
stock
or
hunting
i
have
no
fears
for
myself
nor
any
of
us
while
we
are
all
together
in
corral
but
just
a
few
away
by
themselves
how
easily
they
might
be
cut
off
there
were
indians
seen
this
morning
by
men
looking
for
feed
for
the
stock
it
is
almost
dark
and
the
boys
have
not
come
i
think
the
captain
is
getting
anxious
he
keeps
looking
in
the
direction
the
boys
have
gone
ten
the
boys
have
just
come
with
one
antelope
they
lost
their
bearings
and
came
to
the
river
one
mile
or
more
above
camp
and
that
was
what
kept
them
so
late
when
we
scolded
they
said
they
were
obliged
to
stay
to
get
at
least
one
antelope
for
our
fourth
of
july
dinner
we
celebrate
the
fourth
tuesday
july
we
made
corral
at
eleven
the
captain
announcing
we
will
stay
four
i
do
not
know
if
we
stopped
so
soon
because
it
is
the
fourth
or
because
it
is
so
intensely
warm
and
the
sun
beams
so
hot
or
because
it
was
such
a
delightful
whatever
the
cause
there
we
rested
beneath
the
shade
of
large
cottonwood
trees
and
it
was
so
pleasant
we
had
dinner
at
two
our
oyster
soup
roast
antelope
with
cold
beans
warmed
over
dried
fruit
sauce
and
our
last
cake
and
custard
for
dessert
we
used
the
last
of
our
eggs
which
were
packed
in
salt
it
is
surprising
how
nicely
they
have
kept
i
believe
they
would
have
kept
another
month
we
had
a
very
enjoyable
feast
with
an
abundance
of
lemonade
without
ice
the
boys
put
up
a
large
swing
on
two
large
cottonwood
trees
two
could
swing
at
once
with
lots
of
strong
arms
to
send
us
away
up
high
we
began
to
file
into
the
road
at
three
our
fun
was
all
too
short
fletcher
rode
with
neelie
and
milt
walker
with
me
wednesday
july
here
is
where
we
would
have
crossed
the
south
platte
if
we
had
not
forded
it
at
the
east
end
of
orchard
on
ferry
if
all
those
wagons
had
crossed
on
the
ferry
it
would
have
been
a
big
pile
of
money
for
the
ferrymen
for
they
charge
one
dollar
a
team
we
passed
a
indian
village
it
was
just
teepees
and
huts
oh
dear
but
they
do
look
so
uncomfortable
we
are
at
the
mouth
of
the
cache
la
poudre
where
somebody
cachéd
their
powder
the
water
is
so
very
clear
and
cold
it
seems
so
nice
after
the
muddy
platte
as
there
are
no
stations
on
the
north
side
of
the
river
there
are
no
wells
the
cache
la
poudre
is
supplied
by
springs
that
flow
from
the
mountains
that
seem
to
be
right
over
there
thursday
july
as
we
were
passing
another
indian
town
i
peeped
into
two
or
three
of
their
they
are
homes
no
no
tables
chairs
nor
any
furniture
just
some
rolls
of
blankets
and
buffalo
robes
some
and
that
was
all
there
were
squaws
and
pappooses
innumerable
squatted
around
on
the
outside
of
their
teepees
the
squaws
making
moccasins
or
decorating
them
with
beads
when
we
said
they
grinned
and
held
up
two
fingers
indicating
they
wanted
two
dollars
for
a
pair
we
did
not
purchase
the
black
hills
friday
july
we
are
camped
at
the
foot
of
the
black
hills
they
seem
like
immense
mountains
to
me
there
are
four
large
corrals
near
the
little
village
of
la
porte
we
rushed
through
with
dinner
then
hardinbrooke
and
i
started
for
the
top
taking
our
with
us
before
we
had
gone
far
winthrop
and
frank
joined
us
frank
brought
his
gun
i
do
not
know
if
he
expected
to
find
indians
or
antelope
up
here
after
much
puffing
and
blowing
climbing
and
clambering
we
reached
the
top
oh
it
is
magnificently
grand
if
only
i
could
make
a
of
this
scene
that
others
might
realize
it
as
i
do
the
mount
upon
which
we
stand
is
shaped
like
the
quarter
of
a
ball
or
globe
miles
and
miles
in
diameter
and
circumference
we
having
climbed
up
the
outside
of
the
quarter
to
the
top
edge
are
looking
down
a
steep
precipice
the
perpendicular
side
of
the
quarter
when
a
stone
is
thrown
over
it
takes
it
seconds
to
reach
the
bottom
where
the
cache
la
poudre
river
runs
at
the
base
of
the
precipice
how
easy
to
step
off
into
eternity
from
this
place
i
would
not
like
to
live
near
here
lest
i
might
be
tempted
to
do
it
some
time
the
valley
over
there
looks
as
if
away
back
in
the
ages
past
another
quarter
of
the
great
ball
that
had
been
separated
from
this
quarter
had
been
lifted
by
giant
hands
and
carried
away
leaving
the
most
picturesque
valley
that
i
have
ever
beheld
there
are
three
farms
in
sight
a
large
herd
of
cattle
grazing
and
a
beautiful
grove
or
park
at
the
northern
end
of
the
vale
west
of
the
valley
and
opposite
where
we
stand
are
peaks
much
higher
than
this
behind
which
the
sun
is
sinking
the
setting
sun
has
crowned
the
with
a
crown
of
glory
and
brightness
the
moon
is
rising
out
of
beautiful
white
fleecy
clouds
in
the
east
it
is
lovely
beyond
description
how
beauteous
is
this
earth
how
bright
the
sky
how
wisely
planned
by
him
who
reigns
on
high
the
sun
is
gone
night
is
coming
we
must
go
for
we
are
at
least
one
and
a
half
miles
from
camp
i
fired
gun
before
starting
i
aimed
at
the
river
and
hit
the
mark
how
weak
and
insignificant
these
words
seem
when
compared
with
the
reality
we
visit
a
beautiful
spring
saturday
july
the
scenic
beauty
of
the
route
we
have
come
over
was
ever
changing
we
were
either
coming
through
a
narrow
cañon
across
a
beautiful
vale
climbing
or
descending
a
steep
hill
or
mountain
nellie
bower
and
i
had
started
on
horseback
to
have
the
morning
to
ourselves
when
walker
rode
up
and
asked
us
to
go
with
him
to
a
lovely
spring
of
delightfully
cold
clear
water
he
knew
of
some
two
or
three
miles
ahead
we
consented
of
course
and
had
soon
left
the
wagons
behind
us
has
been
over
the
road
before
and
seems
to
know
the
landmarks
and
places
of
interest
we
found
the
spring
as
described
in
a
beautiful
dell
where
the
loveliest
wild
flowers
i
ever
saw
are
growing
luxuriantly
we
were
soon
off
our
horses
enjoying
the
cool
delicious
spring
water
we
gave
our
horses
a
drink
and
then
we
each
gathered
a
large
bouquet
of
beautiful
fragrant
wild
flowers
they
certainly
are
their
sweetness
on
the
desert
i
believe
we
were
almost
an
hour
ahead
of
the
train
mother
scolded
and
so
did
bower
because
we
had
gone
so
far
ahead
of
the
wagons
for
it
is
said
these
hills
are
full
of
indians
i
am
all
the
time
forgetting
about
the
indians
kerfoot
will
not
allow
his
girls
to
get
out
of
sight
i
am
glad
mother
is
not
so
exacting
as
that
but
i
ought
not
to
impose
upon
her
good
nature
and
cause
her
to
worry
i
never
do
intentionally
but
sometimes
i
forget
we
are
camping
in
a
beautiful
basin
surrounded
on
all
sides
by
high
hills
and
where
the
grass
is
plentiful
there
is
only
one
other
train
with
us
but
then
it
is
the
mcmahan
train
and
they
are
all
such
young
men
and
of
course
they
are
brave
that
i
always
feel
safe
when
they
are
near
our
captain
has
forbidden
our
going
out
of
sight
of
camp
there
are
cañons
in
all
directions
how
i
would
like
to
explore
hillhouse
and
sim
buford
gathered
some
wild
currants
while
herding
they
will
pass
for
fruit
but
they
look
better
than
they
taste
we
have
made
sauce
of
them
with
lots
of
sugar
and
cream
they
look
inviting
and
the
boys
seem
to
like
them
very
few
will
satisfy
me
we
can
always
have
cream
for
breakfast
as
the
milk
stands
over
night
and
a
pat
of
the
sweetest
most
delicious
butter
every
evening
when
we
travel
as
the
milk
is
churned
by
the
motion
of
the
wagon
fruit
is
very
necessary
on
this
trip
because
of
the
alkali
in
the
water
dust
and
air
we
breathe
to
keep
us
in
health
sunday
july
i
was
up
very
early
this
morning
i
can
not
spend
precious
time
in
bed
after
daylight
while
we
are
camping
in
this
delightful
place
and
have
this
perfect
weather
i
led
dick
to
the
spring
for
a
drink
bathed
my
face
and
hands
in
the
cool
water
picked
a
bouquet
for
the
and
returned
to
camp
to
find
the
girls
in
bed
they
missed
a
glorious
sight
by
not
seeing
the
sun
rise
mother
and
hardinbrooke
went
with
me
to
the
top
of
the
hill
nearest
camp
this
afternoon
they
picked
flowers
and
enjoyed
the
view
for
a
while
then
returned
to
camp
leaving
me
to
come
later
i
sat
on
a
large
flat
rock
just
below
the
top
as
mother
said
indians
could
see
me
so
much
farther
if
on
the
very
i
promised
her
i
would
not
go
out
of
sight
that
if
an
indian
carried
me
off
they
could
see
him
and
know
where
i
had
gone
i
did
so
enjoy
the
quiet
of
this
sunday
afternoon
i
had
delightful
book
heavenward
to
read
and
time
passed
so
quickly
the
sun
was
setting
before
i
thought
of
going
back
to
camp
some
of
the
boys
laughed
and
said
were
watching
and
if
an
indian
had
put
in
an
appearance
have
settled
him
we
knew
you
would
not
see
him
until
he
had
i
thanked
them
for
their
watchfulness
we
cut
our
names
in
stone
monday
july
just
when
we
had
mounted
our
ponies
for
our
morning
ride
walker
came
and
asked
us
to
go
with
him
to
the
top
of
a
mountain
we
could
see
far
ahead
and
to
the
right
of
the
road
he
said
prospect
is
very
fine
indeed
from
that
i
was
there
two
years
cash
and
neelie
were
included
in
the
invitation
also
mary
gatewood
but
their
fathers
would
not
let
them
go
so
nellie
bower
and
i
were
the
only
ones
who
were
allowed
to
accept
his
invitation
we
rode
our
ponies
until
the
ascent
became
too
steep
and
then
dismounted
and
climbed
it
was
a
hard
climb
but
we
were
amply
paid
the
view
was
magnificently
grand
we
found
name
where
he
had
cut
it
in
the
soft
stone
two
years
ago
and
we
left
our
names
with
date
and
former
place
of
residence
cut
in
the
stone
there
were
hundreds
of
names
there
but
i
looked
in
vain
for
a
familiar
one
i
wonder
if
any
one
that
we
know
will
find
ours
we
passed
the
graves
of
two
men
this
morning
who
had
been
killed
by
the
indians
what
a
sad
fate
god
forbid
that
any
of
our
men
or
boys
should
die
such
a
death
we
are
camping
near
a
military
post
virginia
dale
it
is
just
as
beautiful
as
the
name
would
imply
there
are
soldiers
here
for
the
protection
of
emigrants
passing
through
these
hills
and
mountains
cash
and
i
were
riding
with
the
captain
when
we
came
to
the
station
the
officer
in
charge
came
out
to
speak
to
the
captain
and
asked
some
significant
questions
long
have
you
been
in
the
hills
days
and
have
you
camped
that
basin
about
eighteen
miles
back
we
stayed
over
the
indians
troubled
you
have
seen
no
he
seemed
greatly
surprised
and
said
has
been
no
train
come
over
that
road
within
the
last
month
without
trouble
especially
where
you
stayed
over
sunday
did
not
you
notice
those
cañons
in
every
direction
the
indians
could
surround
you
before
you
could
know
there
was
one
near
the
hills
are
full
of
he
told
the
captain
where
to
camp
and
where
to
send
the
stock
for
safety
and
protection
the
captain
thanked
him
and
we
were
starting
on
when
the
mcmahan
train
came
in
sight
ha
he
exclaimed
see
now
why
you
have
not
been
molested
just
keep
that
train
in
sight
and
you
need
have
no
fear
of
and
he
just
doubled
up
laughing
until
it
was
embarrassing
to
us
why
why
will
that
train
be
a
protection
more
than
another
you
see
that
portable
engine
lifted
away
up
there
and
all
those
iron
pipes
the
indians
think
it
is
cannon
or
some
sort
of
machinery
invented
for
their
destruction
no
doubt
they
believe
it
could
kill
them
by
the
hundreds
though
the
mountains
stood
between
it
and
so
that
is
why
we
have
not
been
molested
we
have
heard
of
depredations
before
and
behind
us
but
we
have
not
seen
an
indian
blessings
on
the
mcmahan
train
i
hope
we
will
not
lose
sight
of
it
while
we
are
in
this
indian
country
we
have
passed
through
some
very
narrow
cañons
where
there
was
barely
room
for
one
wagon
to
pass
great
rocks
were
hanging
overhead
on
one
side
with
a
rushing
stream
beside
and
just
below
the
road
on
the
other
there
are
beautiful
waterfalls
in
the
cañons
i
was
standing
watching
one
of
the
highest
waiting
for
the
wagons
to
pass
the
last
one
had
gone
when
morrison
came
and
peremptorily
commanded
me
to
on
miss
sallie
the
will
you
off
some
of
these
days
he
stuttered
of
course
i
went
the
orders
are
not
leave
camp
this
we
were
only
just
corralled
when
i
saw
lyde
walker
climbing
a
mountain
it
is
the
first
time
i
have
known
her
to
leave
camp
since
we
came
into
the
black
hills
she
is
very
much
afraid
of
indians
when
she
came
back
i
asked
lyde
did
you
not
hear
the
order
that
we
were
not
to
leave
camp
this
evening
there
is
no
danger
when
the
men
are
on
guard
and
watching
it
is
when
they
feel
secure
and
are
not
looking
out
for
them
that
i
am
afraid
indians
do
not
molest
people
when
they
are
expecting
laramie
plains
tuesday
july
the
sounding
of
the
bugle
and
the
echo
that
reverberated
through
the
mountain
gorges
this
morning
was
enchantingly
sweet
and
must
have
driven
slumber
from
every
eyelid
we
left
the
hills
at
noon
and
are
camping
on
laramie
plains
we
came
over
some
very
steep
rocky
roads
before
we
reached
the
plains
i
watched
the
wagons
anxiously
as
they
descended
the
steep
rocky
bounding
and
bumping
against
the
big
rocks
expecting
and
dreading
an
upset
but
all
landed
safely
on
level
ground
at
last
and
i
gave
a
sigh
of
relief
and
thanksgiving
we
have
not
had
an
uncomfortably
warm
night
all
summer
but
while
we
have
been
coming
through
the
hills
the
nights
have
been
really
cold
so
that
we
have
slept
under
blankets
and
comforts
like
there
is
no
sickness
in
camp
at
all
it
is
marvelous
how
very
well
we
are
i
hope
it
will
continue
so
wednesday
july
we
crossed
the
big
laramie
river
just
before
noon
had
a
good
crossing
the
water
is
clear
the
bed
of
the
river
is
covered
with
gravel
the
banks
are
low
and
the
water
is
not
very
deep
i
rode
across
on
dick
the
water
just
came
to
my
stirrup
we
will
stay
here
until
as
there
is
no
water
for
fifteen
or
twenty
miles
and
we
can
not
go
so
far
in
half
a
day
we
young
people
planned
a
fishing
expedition
for
this
evening
but
the
mosquitoes
are
so
thick
on
the
bank
of
the
river
we
had
to
give
it
up
some
of
the
boys
went
seining
brother
winthrop
was
among
them
so
we
will
have
fish
for
breakfast
morning
the
mosquitoes
have
not
disturbed
our
rest
at
night
yet
they
have
several
times
been
very
thick
on
the
banks
of
the
rivers
but
have
not
been
troublesome
in
camp
perhaps
the
smoke
keeps
them
away
the
mcmahan
train
keeps
with
us
so
we
are
safe
howard
rode
with
us
this
morning
he
is
a
widower
thursday
july
we
passed
two
large
ponds
of
alkali
this
morning
the
water
had
dried
up
and
the
alkali
was
two
or
three
inches
thick
all
over
the
pond
it
looked
like
ice
until
we
came
very
near
hardinbrooke
had
a
sick
headache
this
afternoon
i
took
care
of
little
annie
that
she
might
not
disturb
her
mother
she
is
a
dear
sweet
child
and
seems
fond
of
me
there
was
a
rather
serious
accident
as
we
were
driving
into
corral
horses
were
frightened
and
ran
away
upsetting
the
wagon
and
smashing
it
up
considerably
hazelwood
her
sister
and
two
children
were
in
the
wagon
was
considerably
bruised
the
others
were
not
hurt
dick
drank
alkali
water
this
evening
i
have
been
feeding
him
fat
bacon
no
doubt
the
grease
and
alkali
have
turned
to
soap
before
now
in
his
stomach
and
soap
is
not
poison
so
he
will
not
die
this
time
and
i
will
take
better
care
of
him
the
next
time
we
are
near
alkali
in
the
rain
friday
july
the
men
were
until
almost
noon
repairing
the
broken
wagon
an
accident
that
happens
to
one
is
assumed
by
all
until
results
are
overcome
as
we
were
ready
for
the
start
a
little
girl
ran
among
the
oxen
to
catch
her
pet
crow
an
ox
kicked
her
on
the
forehead
and
cut
a
gash
that
had
to
have
a
few
stitches
and
be
bandaged
so
we
were
delayed
again
when
order
reigned
once
more
we
crossed
the
little
laramie
it
is
very
much
like
the
big
laramie
only
not
so
wide
nor
deep
i
rode
dick
over
and
then
came
on
ahead
of
the
train
keeping
within
sight
when
we
had
traveled
about
an
hour
the
rain
came
down
i
was
likely
to
get
very
wet
before
our
wagons
came
for
they
were
among
the
last
in
the
train
i
took
the
saddle
and
bridle
off
dick
sat
down
on
the
saddle
to
keep
it
dry
and
to
wait
for
the
wagon
i
was
resigning
myself
to
a
drenching
when
grier
driver
of
the
front
wagon
came
and
spread
a
great
big
rubber
coat
over
me
so
that
i
was
completely
sheltered
and
was
hardly
damp
when
our
wagons
came
then
mother
drove
the
horses
close
up
to
the
wagon
in
front
i
tossed
my
saddle
and
bridle
in
hopped
up
on
the
tongue
of
the
wagon
before
the
wagon
behind
got
close
up
and
we
started
without
stopping
but
the
one
wagon
we
could
not
stop
until
we
came
to
feed
for
stock
so
we
were
obliged
to
travel
in
the
rain
we
drove
into
corral
about
four
and
are
again
quite
near
the
mountains
there
are
more
pleasant
things
than
camping
in
the
rain
the
water
is
so
impregnated
with
alkali
i
fear
it
will
cause
sickness
the
stock
are
in
greater
danger
than
we
for
we
can
guard
against
it
saturday
july
as
i
climbed
out
of
the
wagon
this
morning
i
saw
the
most
beautiful
rainbow
i
ever
looked
at
the
bow
was
complete
the
colors
dazzlingly
bright
and
just
as
vivid
in
the
center
as
at
the
ends
it
was
not
raining
in
camp
but
raining
hard
on
the
the
rainbow
was
so
near
we
might
easily
have
reached
the
end
and
the
pot
of
the
rain
came
down
all
morning
we
did
not
break
camp
until
ten
and
then
made
only
a
short
drive
we
are
camping
among
the
hills
once
more
with
not
another
train
in
sight
the
mcmahan
train
is
behind
us
but
we
do
not
know
how
far
away
they
are
so
we
are
glad
to
wait
until
they
catch
up
there
is
a
mountain
near
that
i
would
like
to
climb
but
it
is
against
orders
sunday
july
we
are
all
here
although
some
of
the
women
last
night
seemed
to
think
there
was
small
chance
of
our
seeing
the
light
of
this
sun
had
we
known
that
the
mcmahan
train
was
within
calling
distance
just
a
hill
intervening
perhaps
we
would
have
rested
easier
and
slept
more
soundly
it
is
considered
a
very
dangerous
place
where
we
were
last
night
and
where
we
have
traveled
although
it
is
sunday
i
am
sure
there
is
not
one
in
camp
that
would
have
voted
to
stay
there
to
rest
we
have
heard
horrible
stories
of
the
depredations
that
have
been
committed
along
this
road
and
in
these
mountains
within
the
last
month
we
saw
with
our
own
eyes
just
before
we
came
to
rock
creek
a
station
that
had
been
burned
and
all
the
inmates
killed
or
taken
prisoners
there
were
none
to
tell
the
story
of
the
fight
although
the
bodies
of
all
who
were
known
to
be
there
were
not
found
the
buildings
were
not
all
burned
the
fire
either
went
out
or
was
put
out
by
the
rain
after
the
indians
left
they
have
been
repaired
and
soldiers
stationed
there
now
we
saw
at
the
same
station
a
coach
that
had
been
riddled
with
bullets
it
was
found
on
the
road
about
a
mile
from
the
station
without
horses
driver
or
passengers
indians
it
is
supposed
the
indians
killed
the
driver
took
the
horses
and
it
is
not
known
yet
whether
there
were
passengers
or
not
the
coach
being
so
riddled
with
bullets
it
is
feared
there
were
passengers
a
guard
of
soldiers
go
with
the
coaches
we
meet
or
that
pass
us
now
we
crossed
rock
creek
on
a
and
had
to
pay
fifty
cents
toll
for
each
wagon
just
after
we
crossed
the
bridge
and
where
there
is
a
sudden
turn
in
the
road
as
it
winds
around
the
mountain
we
saw
where
two
men
had
been
killed
and
two
wagons
burned
last
week
the
tire
became
loose
on
a
wheel
of
the
next
to
the
last
wagon
in
a
freight
train
the
men
stopped
to
tighten
it
while
the
rest
of
the
train
moved
on
not
thinking
of
danger
and
was
out
of
sight
in
a
few
minutes
an
hour
later
some
of
the
men
came
back
to
see
what
kept
them
there
they
were
dead
and
scalped
the
horses
gone
and
wagons
on
fire
the
indians
had
taken
all
the
freight
they
could
use
piled
wood
under
the
wagons
and
set
it
on
fire
we
saw
quantities
of
white
beans
scattered
over
the
ground
also
the
irons
from
the
wagons
we
are
within
sight
of
elk
mountain
and
seemingly
quite
near
it
sim
and
hillhouse
picked
a
nice
lot
of
gooseberries
while
stopping
at
noon
i
have
been
sitting
in
the
wagon
picking
off
stems
all
afternoon
they
also
brought
a
bucket
of
snow
it
is
really
refreshing
and
such
a
novelty
to
have
a
to
eat
in
july
the
gooseberries
are
quite
plentiful
around
here
cash
and
i
went
with
hillhouse
and
sim
to
pick
some
this
evening
but
a
shower
drove
us
to
camp
the
boys
stayed
and
picked
as
long
as
they
could
see
if
we
had
time
we
could
gather
gooseberries
enough
to
supply
the
train
for
a
month
they
are
very
fine
and
large
they
are
certainly
an
acceptable
addition
to
our
where
a
sameness
of
diet
is
unavoidable
i
shall
always
consider
them
a
fine
fruit
hereafter
about
an
hour
after
we
drove
into
corral
the
mcmahan
train
came
and
their
corral
is
quite
near
we
are
so
glad
they
are
here
we
feel
safe
when
they
are
near
monday
july
such
a
cold
rainy
dismal
day
as
this
has
been
it
has
rained
without
stopping
from
early
morn
until
now
and
it
is
almost
sundown
this
is
the
first
rain
we
have
had
this
summer
it
has
rained
all
night
several
times
but
that
is
not
so
bad
since
we
have
been
in
this
indian
country
the
tents
have
not
been
put
up
every
one
seems
to
think
it
safer
in
the
wagons
than
in
tents
outside
the
corral
so
we
have
had
to
sit
in
the
wagons
all
day
i
have
read
sewed
written
picked
over
gooseberries
and
ran
through
the
rain
and
visited
some
yet
the
day
has
seemed
long
the
herders
have
to
take
the
stock
two
miles
away
to
find
feed
so
we
are
consumed
with
anxiety
notwithstanding
we
know
our
care
is
round
and
about
us
and
he
can
and
will
protect
us
when
we
came
here
we
could
see
elk
mountain
but
now
it
is
enveloped
in
clouds
entirely
hidden
from
view
it
is
not
pleasant
camping
when
it
rains
all
day
long
tuesday
july
the
wagons
started
soon
after
daylight
before
we
were
out
of
bed
we
had
been
on
the
road
a
little
while
when
i
heard
hillhouse
call
to
brother
winthrop
who
was
driving
our
wagon
just
look
wint
that
a
grand
sight
i
knew
there
was
something
to
see
so
i
was
soon
up
and
dressed
and
sitting
with
winthrop
i
shivered
with
cold
until
my
teeth
chattered
but
was
well
repaid
for
any
inconvenience
by
the
grandeur
of
the
sight
i
looked
upon
why
try
to
describe
or
picture
anything
so
entirely
impossible
the
masses
of
fleecy
white
clouds
with
the
brightness
of
the
morning
sun
shining
upon
them
as
they
floated
around
and
over
the
top
of
the
mountain
made
an
beauteous
panorama
that
i
can
not
describe
as
the
clouds
rose
higher
and
higher
they
seemed
to
mass
over
the
top
of
the
mountain
as
in
benediction
glittering
in
the
sunshine
until
they
seemed
to
melt
away
i
waited
until
the
sun
had
warmed
the
air
then
mounted
dick
for
my
morning
ride
the
mcmahan
train
broke
corral
and
drove
into
line
just
behind
our
wagons
i
had
only
just
started
when
howard
rode
up
on
his
pony
joe
and
requested
the
pleasure
of
riding
with
me
the
doctor
is
a
very
pleasant
cultured
gentleman
and
is
very
fond
of
his
pony
yet
joe
can
not
be
compared
with
dick
for
beauty
neither
for
easy
gait
why
dick
is
the
most
beautiful
pony
on
this
road
he
is
a
bright
bay
with
long
and
heavy
black
mane
and
tail
and
his
gait
is
as
easy
as
a
cradle
i
can
ride
all
day
and
not
be
tired
at
all
while
his
horse
well
i
will
not
describe
him
it
might
hurt
the
feelings
we
came
to
the
foot
of
elk
mountain
on
the
medicine
bow
about
nine
we
find
plentiful
and
excellent
feed
for
the
stock
so
the
captains
have
announced
will
stay
here
until
we
climb
elk
mountain
the
doctor
thanked
me
for
the
pleasure
our
morning
ride
had
afforded
him
and
asked
we
not
make
up
a
party
to
climb
elk
mountain
after
breakfast
hope
so
i
will
ask
some
of
the
young
about
ten
a
few
of
us
commenced
the
climb
lyde
walker
nellie
bower
cash
and
neelie
sim
buford
brother
hillhouse
howard
and
myself
we
were
well
paid
for
the
effort
we
found
beautiful
wild
flowers
and
some
wild
strawberries
not
five
feet
from
a
the
snow
is
in
a
ravine
on
the
north
side
where
the
sun
does
not
shine
the
berries
and
flowers
are
on
the
bank
of
the
ravine
high
enough
to
catch
the
rays
of
the
sun
facing
the
south
the
view
was
fine
we
could
see
a
large
white
lake
far
away
to
the
west
howard
said
it
was
alkali
wednesday
july
we
passed
the
alkali
lake
this
afternoon
it
was
a
strangely
beautiful
sight
the
water
as
white
as
milk
the
grass
on
the
border
intensely
green
i
always
thought
grass
would
not
grow
where
there
is
alkali
but
it
is
certainly
growing
there
the
contrast
of
white
and
green
was
vivid
the
wind
was
blowing
the
water
into
little
glittering
dancing
skipping
wavelets
the
sight
was
so
unusual
that
it
was
fascinating
though
the
water
is
so
dreadfully
poisonous
there
are
several
musicians
in
the
mcmahan
train
lyde
says
they
serenaded
me
last
night
she
says
they
stood
between
our
two
wagons
i
think
she
is
trying
to
tease
me
howard
if
you
do
not
believe
me
he
was
one
of
no
i
would
be
ashamed
to
acknowledge
i
did
not
hear
them
and
would
feel
like
a
dunce
if
they
had
not
been
howard
gave
me
the
bouquet
he
gathered
on
elk
mountain
which
was
most
beautifully
arranged
and
asked
me
keep
it
until
it
falls
to
i
have
put
it
between
the
leaves
of
a
book
and
will
perhaps
never
think
of
it
again
we
came
through
fort
halleck
there
were
eight
wigwams
or
teepees
at
the
east
end
of
the
town
the
squaws
wore
calico
dresses
and
hoops
i
believe
they
were
more
than
in
their
blankets
i
fail
as
yet
to
recognize
noble
red
they
are
anything
else
than
dignified
they
seem
lazy
dirty
creatures
cash
and
i
made
a
few
purchases
at
fort
halleck
i
paid
eighty
cents
for
a
quire
of
writing
paper
and
cash
paid
fifty
cents
for
a
can
of
peaches
morrison
is
on
the
and
delia
kerfoot
has
a
very
sore
mouth
scurvy
the
doctor
says
caused
by
the
alkali
in
the
dust
and
air
neelie
and
frank
are
both
complaining
we
cross
the
north
platte
thursday
july
the
ground
was
covered
with
a
white
frost
this
morning
and
it
is
freezing
cold
morrison
and
frank
are
better
mouth
is
healing
neelie
continues
to
drag
around
she
will
not
acknowledge
that
she
is
sick
enough
to
go
to
bed
but
she
certainly
looks
sick
i
wish
they
would
call
howard
somehow
i
have
more
faith
in
him
perhaps
because
he
is
older
and
more
experienced
we
are
on
the
banks
of
the
north
platte
arrived
about
three
did
not
stop
for
lunch
at
noon
we
came
ahead
of
the
other
trains
which
will
be
here
we
will
have
the
privilege
of
crossing
first
in
the
morning
the
men
have
taken
the
herds
five
miles
away
to
get
good
feed
they
are
in
danger
from
indians
the
captain
called
for
volunteers
my
brothers
both
offered
to
go
but
the
captain
said
one
of
boys
must
hillhouse
said
he
would
be
the
one
he
was
on
guard
last
night
too
we
are
in
no
danger
here
for
there
are
several
trains
here
now
and
there
will
be
more
oh
the
anxious
watching
the
prayerful
longing
for
day
that
we
must
endure
this
night
because
of
loved
ones
exposed
to
danger
what
a
precious
privilege
that
we
can
go
to
the
with
the
assurance
that
if
we
ask
aright
our
petitions
will
be
granted
how
do
people
live
without
christ
and
a
what
can
they
do
when
suffering
anxiety
grief
or
bereavement
if
they
can
not
go
to
jesus
with
their
sorrows
precious
saviour
what
a
refuge
in
time
of
trouble
what
a
joy
to
carry
everything
to
god
in
prayer
the
mcmahan
train
is
near
howard
has
been
here
he
begged
me
to
let
him
see
my
diary
i
asked
to
be
excused
friday
july
the
night
passed
without
alarm
and
we
are
all
here
i
am
thankful
some
of
the
men
in
our
train
were
afraid
to
risk
fording
the
river
and
paid
four
dollars
per
wagon
to
be
ferried
over
on
a
rickety
old
ferryboat
that
looked
more
dangerous
than
driving
over
hillhouse
and
winthrop
were
both
engaged
with
the
winthrop
on
the
seat
and
hillhouse
riding
dick
when
they
drove
into
the
river
i
motioned
to
mother
to
keep
quiet
and
drove
the
right
in
behind
them
the
current
is
very
swift
they
had
all
they
could
do
to
keep
the
oxen
from
going
with
the
current
and
did
not
know
i
had
followed
them
until
they
came
out
on
an
island
in
the
middle
of
the
river
hillhouse
smiled
a
sickly
little
smile
and
said
should
not
have
tried
howard
stood
near
holding
his
pony
by
the
bridle
he
complimented
me
on
my
skill
in
driving
and
said
saw
you
drive
in
that
swift
and
treacherous
river
with
bated
breath
but
soon
saw
that
you
knew
what
you
were
doing
yet
i
rode
joe
in
just
behind
you
to
be
ready
for
you
for
your
thoughtfulness
i
will
not
until
i
am
out
of
the
the
other
side
is
to
be
crossed
hillhouse
said
would
better
wait
on
the
island
and
i
will
come
back
and
drive
your
wagon
but
of
course
i
could
not
do
that
after
all
the
complimenting
i
had
received
i
drove
in
with
fear
and
trembling
for
there
lay
a
big
freight
wagon
upset
in
the
middle
of
the
stream
it
was
more
difficult
than
the
first
side
the
banks
higher
and
steeper
and
the
water
deeper
we
got
over
without
mishap
the
doctor
came
on
his
pony
just
behind
us
i
wandered
off
alone
after
lunch
and
climbed
to
the
top
of
a
mountain
i
found
there
a
large
pyramid
of
loose
stones
that
looked
as
if
they
had
been
piled
there
by
travelers
each
one
contributing
a
stone
i
selected
a
stone
from
the
and
added
to
the
pile
there
is
another
town
of
wagons
being
made
on
the
west
side
of
the
north
platte
the
wagons
have
been
crossing
all
day
and
are
crossing
yet
hundreds
of
wagons
have
been
driven
over
that
turbulent
and
rushing
river
and
not
a
serious
accident
occurred
i
have
been
on
the
lookout
for
the
irvine
train
but
it
is
not
here
i
think
it
is
ahead
of
us
and
we
will
not
see
the
young
ladies
or
reade
again
on
this
trip
yet
as
we
are
all
going
to
montana
we
may
perhaps
meet
again
neelie
is
sick
saturday
july
we
are
within
sight
of
pine
grove
in
wyoming
territory
neelie
was
very
much
better
this
morning
almost
well
she
said
at
noon
and
rode
her
pony
this
afternoon
i
was
riding
with
her
when
i
noticed
a
heavy
coming
i
begged
her
to
come
on
and
not
risk
getting
wet
no
miss
sallie
i
want
to
ride
fast
this
air
is
so
delicious
and
i
think
i
want
to
ride
alone
for
a
while
you
go
on
and
i
will
come
very
i
saw
it
was
useless
to
urge
her
i
am
always
careful
not
to
expose
myself
unnecessarily
to
a
drenching
so
i
raced
on
to
our
own
wagons
and
had
barely
time
to
unsaddle
dick
and
turn
him
loose
when
down
came
the
rain
in
torrents
i
was
so
anxious
about
neelie
and
expected
her
to
come
tearing
through
the
rain
i
looked
from
the
back
of
the
wagon
and
saw
her
coming
plodding
along
at
the
same
slow
gait
as
if
she
did
not
know
it
was
raining
when
the
rain
was
almost
over
she
came
along
drenched
of
course
she
laughed
at
my
look
of
dismay
and
paid
no
heed
to
my
scolding
mother
and
i
both
urged
her
to
go
quickly
and
change
her
wet
garments
for
dry
and
warm
ones
she
got
off
her
horse
and
climbed
into
the
wagon
when
we
stopped
i
went
around
to
see
how
she
fared
she
sat
in
the
wagon
with
a
around
her
and
the
wet
clothes
had
not
been
changed
for
dry
ones
she
was
shivering
with
cold
neelie
my
precious
girl
i
am
afraid
you
have
killed
no
miss
sallie
i
am
not
so
easily
killed
as
all
neelie
you
have
been
sick
for
a
week
and
now
to
get
this
drenching
i
fear
the
the
family
do
not
appear
at
all
anxious
so
there
is
nothing
i
can
do
but
hope
and
trust
that
her
naturally
strong
constitution
may
bear
even
this
strain
i
advised
her
to
go
to
bed
drink
hot
tea
and
get
into
a
perspiration
i
doubt
very
much
if
she
will
do
it
milt
walker
is
on
the
too
hillhouse
went
to
bed
with
a
severe
headache
last
night
but
a
rest
has
entirely
restored
him
we
crossed
three
very
muddy
streams
the
first
muddy
water
we
have
seen
since
leaving
the
south
platte
since
coming
to
the
mountains
the
water
has
been
as
clear
as
crystal
until
perhaps
we
are
coming
into
mining
country
we
stopped
quite
early
this
afternoon
the
mcmahan
train
has
passed
and
gone
out
of
sight
i
hope
they
will
not
go
too
far
and
that
they
will
lend
us
protection
with
their
portable
engine
and
other
machinery
sunday
july
we
are
resting
i
went
with
hardinbrooke
lyde
and
a
gentleman
friend
of
for
a
long
ramble
over
the
mountains
this
afternoon
we
found
a
most
delightful
spring
where
the
water
seemingly
gushes
out
of
the
rock
just
below
this
spring
was
a
patch
of
the
finest
wild
onions
i
ever
saw
we
brought
a
good
supply
to
camp
we
are
so
starved
for
green
vegetables
that
everyone
seems
to
enjoy
the
onions
though
some
had
never
eaten
onions
before
they
said
for
my
part
i
always
did
like
onions
the
summit
oe
the
rocky
mountains
monday
july
we
passed
the
summit
of
the
rockies
and
are
camping
on
the
western
or
pacific
slope
the
ascent
has
been
so
gradual
we
should
not
have
known
when
we
reached
the
top
but
for
the
little
rivulets
running
in
different
directions
quite
on
the
summit
and
very
near
to
each
other
we
saw
two
little
rivulets
starting
on
their
way
one
to
meander
toward
the
pacific
while
the
other
will
empty
its
confluence
into
the
mississippi
and
thence
on
to
the
gulf
just
a
scoopful
of
earth
could
change
the
course
of
either
where
they
started
from
the
same
spring
really
as
it
is
how
widely
different
the
scenes
through
which
they
will
pass
so
it
is
with
human
lives
a
crisis
is
reached
a
decision
is
made
and
in
one
short
hour
the
whole
trend
of
our
life
is
changed
with
regard
to
our
surroundings
associates
environments
etc
we
came
through
pass
crossed
a
toll
bridge
near
sulphur
springs
and
had
to
pay
fifty
cents
toll
for
each
wagon
the
streams
are
all
muddy
that
we
have
crossed
we
saw
two
beaver
dams
they
look
like
the
work
of
man
with
shovel
and
trowel
we
are
camping
two
miles
west
of
sulphur
springs
tuesday
july
we
are
camping
near
another
muddy
creek
near
a
station
that
was
attacked
by
indians
ten
days
ago
they
wounded
one
soldier
very
severely
and
ran
off
with
nine
horses
after
we
were
in
corral
while
waiting
for
the
stove
to
be
set
up
and
the
fire
to
be
made
i
was
sitting
in
idling
and
thinking
when
neelie
came
to
me
she
dropped
upon
the
grass
beside
me
and
laying
her
head
in
my
lap
said
miss
sallie
i
am
afraid
i
am
going
to
be
sick
in
spite
of
everything
and
i
have
tried
so
hard
to
get
well
without
sending
for
the
fletcher
is
desperately
in
love
with
her
and
tried
to
tell
her
so
one
day
not
long
ago
catching
her
hands
while
talking
which
she
resented
as
a
familiarity
and
has
not
spoken
to
him
since
she
told
me
about
it
the
evening
after
it
happened
at
noon
i
told
her
i
believed
he
was
sincerely
in
earnest
and
that
she
had
wounded
him
deeply
she
told
me
what
she
had
done
to
try
to
cure
herself
the
medicine
she
has
taken
is
enough
to
kill
her
i
called
mother
and
told
her
what
neelie
had
told
me
mother
said
poor
child
you
do
look
sick
indeed
you
must
go
to
bed
and
send
for
the
doctor
right
i
went
with
her
to
the
wagon
helped
her
to
get
ready
for
bed
and
told
cash
to
send
for
fletcher
she
said
she
would
as
soon
as
bush
her
brother
came
after
dinner
i
went
again
to
see
neelie
the
doctor
had
not
yet
come
but
bush
had
gone
for
him
i
stepped
upon
the
tongue
of
the
wagon
and
could
with
difficulty
restrain
an
exclamation
of
disgust
neelie
interpreted
my
expression
and
said
just
would
do
it
said
i
was
looking
so
like
a
cash
had
powdered
and
painted
pale
face
and
crimped
and
curled
her
hair
and
made
her
look
ridiculous
trying
to
hide
the
sick
look
from
the
doctor
i
did
not
answer
neelie
but
went
and
scolded
cash
in
a
low
tone
she
said
was
so
dark
around
the
eyes
her
lips
blue
and
her
cheeks
so
pale
i
could
not
bear
to
have
fletcher
see
her
looking
so
homely
she
has
told
you
about
their
little
but
you
suppose
he
can
see
through
that
paint
and
powder
i
am
afraid
he
will
think
neelie
did
it
and
she
will
appear
ridiculous
in
his
i
saw
the
doctor
coming
so
came
away
as
i
was
sitting
here
writing
he
came
a
while
ago
and
said
raymond
will
you
sit
with
miss
kerfoot
and
see
that
she
has
her
medicine
strictly
at
the
right
time
i
will
is
she
very
sick
doctor
is
in
a
much
more
serious
condition
than
she
or
the
family
realize
it
would
not
be
wise
to
alarm
her
but
the
family
ought
to
know
she
will
need
very
careful
attention
i
will
tell
them
you
need
not
sit
up
after
the
last
dose
of
medicine
is
given
which
will
be
at
midnight
i
think
she
will
rest
better
if
everything
is
quiet
and
the
lights
i
know
from
the
tone
and
manner
he
thinks
neelie
dangerously
ill
the
doctor
gave
me
directions
about
her
medicine
and
i
went
immediately
to
her
wagon
sim
buford
sick
wednesday
july
last
evening
as
i
was
on
my
way
to
sit
with
neelie
i
met
ezra
he
said
sallie
sim
is
quite
sick
very
much
like
cousin
neelie
is
i
think
i
wonder
if
we
are
all
going
to
be
sick
no
i
hope
not
i
am
very
sorry
sim
is
when
i
left
neelie
a
little
after
midnight
sleeping
quietly
to
come
home
i
noticed
a
light
in
the
wagon
that
sim
and
frank
occupy
i
did
not
awake
this
morning
until
everything
was
ready
for
a
very
early
start
mother
had
kept
my
breakfast
warm
by
keeping
the
stove
until
the
last
minute
i
sat
in
the
wagon
and
ate
my
breakfast
after
the
train
had
started
when
through
i
climbed
out
and
went
to
see
how
neelie
was
i
found
her
feverish
and
restless
her
symptoms
unfavorable
oh
the
dust
the
dust
it
is
terrible
i
have
never
seen
it
half
as
bad
it
seems
to
be
almost
in
places
we
came
twenty
miles
without
stopping
and
then
camped
for
the
night
we
are
near
a
fine
spring
of
most
excellent
water
barrel
spring
it
is
called
i
do
not
know
why
there
are
no
barrels
there
when
we
stopped
the
faces
were
a
sight
they
were
covered
with
all
the
dust
that
could
stick
on
one
could
just
see
the
apertures
where
eyes
nose
and
mouth
were
through
the
dust
their
appearance
was
frightful
how
glad
we
all
are
to
have
plenty
of
clear
cold
water
to
wash
away
the
dust
neelie
is
no
better
such
a
long
drive
without
rest
and
through
such
dust
was
enough
to
make
a
well
person
sick
i
fear
the
consequences
for
both
neelie
and
sim
for
sim
is
a
very
sick
boy
hillhouse
told
sim
last
night
that
we
would
take
him
with
us
and
take
care
of
him
if
he
wanted
to
come
and
kerfoot
would
let
him
he
wants
to
come
of
course
so
he
sent
for
kerfoot
this
morning
to
come
to
his
wagon
as
he
wished
to
see
him
on
business
kerfoot
came
and
sim
asked
to
be
released
from
his
contract
to
drive
through
to
california
kerfoot
asked
do
you
want
to
leave
us
believe
montana
is
the
place
for
a
young
man
to
go
and
besides
i
am
very
sick
and
can
have
better
care
with
the
raymonds
than
i
can
here
for
neelie
needs
all
your
reckon
your
chances
are
as
good
as
the
rest
of
us
and
walked
off
frank
came
for
me
and
i
went
to
see
sim
he
is
very
sick
has
a
high
fever
and
coated
tongue
he
asked
me
to
see
kerfoot
frank
went
with
me
seemed
to
know
what
we
came
for
he
was
scarcely
civil
i
put
the
case
plainly
and
said
must
take
care
of
sim
either
with
or
without
your
consent
we
owe
it
to
his
father
and
mother
and
to
himself
to
see
that
he
is
taken
care
of
he
can
not
be
taken
care
of
where
he
after
the
wagon
and
making
room
for
bed
and
other
belongings
ezra
frank
and
hillhouse
helped
him
to
the
wagon
and
put
him
to
bed
while
i
went
to
the
mcmahan
train
which
was
quite
near
and
asked
howard
to
come
and
prescribe
for
him
the
doctor
came
bringing
the
medicine
with
him
he
says
it
is
mountain
fever
our
train
divided
the
separation
of
the
train
is
being
talked
of
and
is
no
doubt
absolutely
necessary
for
the
herd
is
so
large
it
is
hard
to
find
pasture
for
them
all
together
when
the
division
is
made
those
going
to
california
will
form
one
corral
and
those
bound
for
montana
will
form
another
this
will
separate
us
from
family
i
do
hope
we
will
not
have
to
part
while
neelie
is
so
sick
i
do
so
want
to
help
take
care
of
her
thursday
july
among
the
families
that
came
into
our
train
at
kearney
was
a
family
of
four
young
ladies
and
their
father
a
widower
named
ryan
sue
kate
mary
and
maggie
are
their
names
ryan
told
some
of
the
young
men
that
he
was
taking
his
daughters
to
the
west
where
there
are
more
men
and
fewer
women
so
they
could
have
a
better
chance
to
get
good
husbands
than
in
missouri
it
has
been
a
good
joke
among
the
boys
and
some
of
them
have
tried
to
be
very
gallant
to
the
young
ladies
as
they
are
on
the
market
george
carpenter
a
driver
for
hardinbrooke
and
walker
when
the
train
separated
this
morning
pretended
to
go
into
hysterics
he
had
a
fit
on
the
inside
of
the
corral
when
ryan
drove
off
with
the
other
half
of
the
train
kerfoot
did
not
know
he
was
fooling
and
ran
to
his
assistance
the
captain
passed
took
in
the
situation
and
smiled
kerfoot
knew
then
it
was
a
hoax
and
it
made
him
so
mad
he
declared
he
would
not
stay
in
a
train
where
the
captain
would
smile
at
such
conduct
the
doctor
had
said
to
him
is
necessary
that
i
see
neelie
several
times
during
the
day
and
you
will
be
taking
great
risk
if
you
leave
the
train
until
she
is
much
he
had
decided
to
stay
and
join
the
others
any
time
before
they
came
to
the
california
road
west
of
green
river
he
was
so
mad
at
the
captain
for
smiling
at
nonsense
and
because
he
did
not
rebuke
him
that
he
made
the
boys
bring
in
the
horses
and
cattle
and
hitch
up
as
quickly
as
possible
in
an
hour
after
the
others
started
they
had
followed
kerfoot
did
not
say
to
any
one
i
do
hope
neelie
will
not
suffer
for
his
crankiness
we
are
now
a
corral
of
twenty
wagons
the
greater
number
freight
wagons
they
are
in
corral
on
the
opposite
side
while
the
families
are
all
on
our
side
the
hardinbrookes
walkers
bowers
kennedys
morrisons
currys
a
family
of
five
and
baily
and
their
daughter
about
ten
years
old
and
a
widowed
sister
of
baily
and
her
little
girl
about
the
same
age
as
her
cousin
are
with
us
at
the
back
end
of
the
corral
i
do
not
know
these
people
only
just
to
speak
when
we
meet
but
they
now
help
to
form
our
corral
we
came
only
two
or
three
miles
after
the
train
separated
just
far
enough
to
get
out
of
the
dust
family
and
ours
have
been
almost
as
one
family
since
we
have
been
on
the
road
and
i
have
become
greatly
attached
to
all
of
them
and
especially
to
neelie
she
is
the
dearest
sweetest
girl
so
very
unselfish
and
always
ready
to
help
any
and
every
one
that
needs
help
there
is
not
one
in
the
family
but
could
be
spared
better
than
neelie
except
of
course
her
father
they
all
love
her
so
and
depend
upon
her
for
everything
she
is
a
precious
daughter
a
darling
sister
and
a
true
friend
sim
is
very
much
better
he
has
some
fever
but
not
so
high
a
temperature
as
yesterday
howard
is
very
attentive
he
says
it
is
mountain
fever
that
sim
and
neelie
both
have
fletcher
called
him
to
see
neelie
he
says
she
is
a
very
sick
girl
but
not
worse
than
sim
was
when
he
first
saw
him
her
temperature
is
not
so
high
i
wonder
if
mountain
fever
is
contagious
or
what
it
is
that
causes
it
it
seems
the
air
is
so
pure
and
invigorating
one
could
not
get
sick
at
all
i
never
felt
better
in
my
life
and
mother
seems
so
well
i
am
afraid
it
is
the
sameness
of
diet
and
poor
cooking
that
is
making
folk
sick
the
bread
they
make
is
hard
as
when
cold
we
overtake
the
california
train
friday
july
we
came
up
with
the
other
half
of
the
train
about
ten
and
have
traveled
in
company
the
rest
of
the
day
we
have
separate
corrals
about
two
hundred
yards
apart
the
stock
is
not
herded
together
neelie
has
been
restless
with
high
fever
and
flighty
when
she
dozes
with
eyes
half
open
poor
girl
she
is
certainly
very
very
sick
we
are
near
a
delightful
spring
cold
as
ice
and
clear
as
crystal
i
went
to
the
spring
to
bathe
my
face
and
hands
and
brush
my
hair
kerfoot
and
frank
came
for
water
kerfoot
said
sallie
why
you
and
your
folks
come
and
go
to
california
where
you
started
to
go
uncle
ezra
you
know
the
reason
we
think
montana
the
better
place
for
the
boys
to
get
a
start
and
we
want
to
do
the
best
we
can
for
tut
wealth
is
not
the
chief
thing
in
life
you
can
make
a
living
anywhere
and
montana
is
an
awful
place
why
the
only
law
they
have
is
mob
law
and
if
a
man
is
accused
of
crime
he
is
hung
without
judge
or
there
seems
to
be
a
great
many
nice
people
going
there
and
i
am
not
in
the
least
afraid
of
my
brothers
being
accused
of
do
believe
you
will
regret
going
to
montana
and
i
also
believe
it
is
all
your
doing
that
you
are
going
i
think
it
is
very
unkind
of
you
to
leave
us
now
when
neelie
is
so
sick
and
needs
you
so
are
not
leaving
you
kerfoot
it
is
you
leaving
us
against
the
orders
i
made
a
great
mistake
saying
that
he
fairly
raved
he
was
so
angry
actually
beside
himself
with
rage
he
said
very
unkind
things
without
the
least
foundation
or
truth
in
them
and
which
i
will
try
to
forget
i
am
so
sorry
for
him
i
did
not
answer
a
single
angry
word
and
i
am
glad
i
did
not
but
frank
did
he
was
about
as
angry
as
his
uncle
was
and
talked
manfully
in
my
defense
he
gave
his
uncle
the
lie
and
clenched
his
fists
and
seemed
ready
to
fight
i
ended
the
embarrassing
scene
by
walking
away
hardinbrooke
was
waiting
for
me
we
climbed
to
the
top
of
a
very
steep
point
which
was
hard
to
climb
and
we
were
out
of
breath
when
we
reached
the
top
and
were
glad
to
sit
and
rest
the
view
was
fine
the
evening
pleasant
and
we
were
glad
of
each
companionship
but
we
did
not
talk
i
think
hardinbrooke
attributed
my
silence
to
anxiety
about
neelie
and
she
was
not
far
from
the
truth
saturday
july
neelie
was
very
much
better
this
morning
her
fever
gone
she
was
very
weak
but
was
free
from
pain
her
medicine
had
the
desired
effect
she
had
rested
quite
well
last
night
better
than
since
she
has
been
sick
and
all
her
symptoms
are
favorable
the
doctor
seemed
greatly
encouraged
and
told
kerfoot
that
if
they
would
stay
here
until
monday
he
felt
sure
neelie
would
be
out
of
danger
and
they
could
move
on
without
any
risk
of
doing
her
harm
he
did
not
dream
that
kerfoot
would
again
disregard
his
advice
neelie
continued
better
until
noon
then
some
one
proposed
moving
on
a
half
drive
thought
it
would
not
hurt
her
if
they
made
only
short
drives
at
a
time
kerfoot
listened
and
finally
consented
he
is
very
much
afraid
of
indians
and
in
a
few
days
we
will
be
out
of
the
country
the
doctor
is
very
much
out
of
patience
with
him
told
me
he
gave
kerfoot
a
piece
of
his
mind
you
must
make
big
allowance
for
the
poor
man
he
does
not
realize
that
he
is
endangering
life
he
can
not
believe
it
possible
that
such
a
calamity
as
death
can
befall
them
while
he
is
trusting
in
a
merciful
father
above
yet
i
do
wish
someone
might
have
exercised
authority
and
prevented
their
going
sim
is
very
much
better
improving
rapidly
walker
is
able
to
be
around
once
more
i
wonder
if
he
had
mountain
fever
i
have
been
trying
to
get
the
dust
out
of
our
wagon
this
afternoon
it
was
hard
work
taking
everything
out
and
cleaning
off
the
dust
lyde
walker
pleasantly
entertained
us
this
evening
with
songs
accompanied
with
guitar
the
wagon
the
walkers
occupy
is
just
in
front
of
ours
since
the
separation
on
bitter
creek
sunday
july
we
came
fifteen
miles
but
have
not
overtaken
the
california
train
it
must
be
that
neelie
is
no
worse
and
their
traveling
yesterday
did
her
no
harm
or
they
would
have
waited
over
we
shall
hope
so
anyway
howard
rode
with
me
this
morning
we
are
traveling
on
bitter
creek
which
is
considered
the
very
worst
part
of
all
the
road
i
had
heard
so
much
about
the
desolateness
of
this
part
of
the
country
that
i
expected
to
find
a
barren
waste
it
is
not
so
bad
as
represented
there
are
long
distances
where
there
is
not
sufficient
pasture
for
the
stock
but
in
places
the
feed
is
plentiful
the
captain
and
two
or
three
men
are
off
the
road
the
greater
part
of
the
day
hunting
pasture
we
stop
when
they
find
it
at
whatever
hour
it
may
be
monday
july
we
came
twelve
miles
passed
one
station
it
was
built
of
stone
and
seemed
a
very
comfortable
place
hardinbrooke
has
been
quite
sick
i
have
taken
care
of
little
annie
we
have
not
had
any
word
from
neelie
i
trust
that
no
news
means
good
news
sim
was
able
to
sit
up
in
the
wagon
for
a
while
this
afternoon
i
think
with
care
he
will
be
well
in
a
few
days
we
have
had
delightful
weather
since
we
passed
the
summit
the
roads
are
quite
dusty
but
not
like
they
were
before
we
came
to
barrel
springs
the
water
in
bitter
creek
is
not
so
nice
as
the
mountain
streams
and
springs
but
it
is
not
bitter
as
i
thought
it
would
be
from
its
name
tuesday
august
we
are
at
point
of
rocks
the
place
is
rightly
named
one
who
never
saw
them
could
hardly
imagine
such
enormous
piles
of
rock
they
are
high
as
mountains
with
scarcely
any
dirt
among
them
the
sides
are
smooth
and
even
the
stone
is
soft
like
slate
or
sandstone
and
the
whole
face
of
the
enormous
pile
as
high
as
man
can
reach
is
literally
covered
with
names
dates
and
places
of
former
residence
from
all
over
the
united
states
i
looked
in
vain
for
some
familiar
name
i
left
my
name
in
a
conspicuous
place
so
if
any
of
my
friends
look
for
my
name
they
will
not
be
disappointed
there
are
springs
flowing
from
the
clefts
in
the
rock
and
oh
with
what
pleasurable
anticipation
did
i
hasten
to
partake
of
the
pure
water
as
i
of
course
supposed
it
was
i
had
been
riding
with
the
captain
as
he
came
ahead
to
find
a
camping
place
when
the
train
came
i
rode
to
our
wagon
got
a
cup
and
crossed
bitter
creek
to
get
a
drink
of
nice
cold
spring
water
i
took
one
swallow
oh
oh
oh
the
horrid
stuff
i
was
glad
there
was
no
one
with
me
to
see
the
face
i
made
i
think
i
never
swallowed
a
more
disagreeable
dose
it
was
the
strongest
i
ever
tasted
in
my
haste
and
eagerness
i
did
not
notice
that
the
atmosphere
was
impregnated
with
sulphur
and
the
sulphur
formations
around
the
springs
because
they
were
covered
with
dust
the
wind
is
blowing
as
cold
as
greenland
i
expect
we
will
have
to
go
to
bed
to
keep
from
freezing
hardinbrooke
is
no
better
her
symptoms
are
the
same
as
and
were
at
first
and
we
fear
she
is
taking
the
fever
fletcher
thinks
neelie
must
be
better
or
we
would
have
heard
as
kerfoot
said
he
would
send
back
for
him
if
she
got
any
worse
delayed
another
day
wednesday
august
we
had
a
very
cold
night
there
was
ice
a
quarter
of
an
inch
thick
this
morning
several
head
of
and
cattle
were
missing
this
morning
the
men
have
been
hunting
them
all
day
they
were
found
this
evening
in
a
cañon
four
miles
from
camp
there
were
the
tracks
of
two
horses
with
shoes
that
had
driven
them
there
the
indians
do
not
shoe
their
horses
so
there
must
be
thieves
besides
indians
in
this
country
and
here
we
are
another
whole
drive
behind
the
other
half
of
our
train
oh
i
wonder
if
it
will
be
possible
to
overtake
them
now
before
our
roads
separate
entirely
they
must
be
at
least
two
days
ahead
of
us
if
they
have
not
been
delayed
thursday
august
the
mountains
in
this
region
are
very
barren
composed
of
sand
and
rock
principally
it
comes
nearer
being
desert
than
anywhere
on
the
road
we
have
traveled
all
day
and
have
come
only
thirteen
miles
the
road
has
been
very
rough
indeed
i
rode
in
the
wagon
the
greater
part
of
the
day
so
i
could
take
care
of
little
annie
hardinbrooke
her
mother
is
very
sick
i
have
thought
so
much
about
neelie
whenever
the
wheels
would
strike
a
rock
or
jolt
down
into
a
rut
how
she
must
have
suffered
if
in
pain
or
fever
how
hard
it
must
have
been
for
her
lyde
says
fletcher
is
very
impatient
and
cross
because
of
the
delay
he
threatened
to
take
a
horse
and
go
horseback
yesterday
when
he
found
the
train
would
not
move
she
thinks
he
is
very
anxious
about
neelie
and
very
much
in
love
friday
august
the
wolves
howled
around
our
camp
all
last
night
and
kept
cæsar
our
barking
so
we
could
not
sleep
have
made
only
a
short
drive
and
are
camping
at
rock
springs
where
the
road
forks
the
men
are
not
agreed
as
to
which
road
to
take
the
upper
or
road
is
the
shortest
but
the
lower
is
best
supplied
with
pasture
and
water
if
we
take
the
upper
road
we
can
not
hope
to
see
our
friends
again
so
fletcher
and
i
want
to
take
the
lower
road
for
we
still
hope
that
we
may
overtake
them
hardinbrooke
is
very
sick
i
fear
we
are
going
to
have
another
case
of
serious
sickness
in
our
camp
i
have
taken
care
of
annie
again
which
seems
to
be
the
most
efficient
service
i
can
render
as
lyde
and
joe
walker
take
care
of
hardinbrooke
when
her
husband
can
not
be
with
her
he
takes
all
the
care
of
her
at
night
and
a
most
excellent
nurse
he
seems
to
be
sim
is
quite
well
only
pale
and
weak
saturday
august
the
decision
was
made
in
favor
of
the
lower
road
as
the
train
was
rolling
out
i
had
just
mounted
my
pony
when
fletcher
came
and
asked
me
to
ride
with
him
he
has
never
seemed
to
care
for
my
company
nor
i
for
his
until
since
we
have
been
so
anxious
about
neelie
our
anxiety
has
been
a
bond
of
sympathy
and
we
have
rather
enjoyed
each
society
we
had
gone
a
short
distance
ahead
of
the
train
when
we
saw
someone
coming
horseback
i
soon
saw
that
it
was
frank
we
hurried
on
to
meet
him
he
shook
hands
without
speaking
i
asked
is
neelie
is
very
low
i
came
after
you
doctor
our
camp
is
about
four
miles
from
here
we
have
waited
two
days
for
you
and
thought
you
would
certainly
come
yesterday
when
you
did
not
come
we
thought
you
must
have
gone
the
upper
road
and
i
was
going
back
as
far
as
the
first
station
to
inquire
if
you
had
passed
i
am
glad
indeed
to
meet
you
but
greatly
fear
you
will
not
be
in
time
to
save
the
doctor
asked
two
or
three
questions
excused
himself
and
rode
away
at
a
gallop
leaving
frank
and
i
to
follow
while
i
plied
him
with
questions
which
he
answered
patiently
he
then
said
was
much
better
for
a
day
or
two
after
we
left
you
we
all
thought
she
was
getting
well
she
spoke
of
you
every
time
i
saw
her
and
wondered
why
you
did
not
come
since
the
fever
came
back
i
have
not
talked
to
her
at
all
part
of
the
time
she
has
been
delirious
and
when
conscious
she
was
too
weak
to
oh
dear
i
do
so
want
to
see
her
and
help
take
care
of
her
a
fatal
shooting
we
rode
a
while
in
silence
then
frank
said
is
not
all
the
bad
news
i
have
to
tell
miss
i
looked
up
quickly
and
asked
else
has
happened
frank
was
shot
and
killed
day
before
yesterday
frank
how
did
it
happen
did
it
but
i
think
he
was
not
much
to
frasier
is
the
man
who
spoke
to
cash
neelie
and
i
as
we
were
watching
the
wagons
ferried
across
the
missouri
river
whose
son
ran
away
from
his
mother
and
home
to
come
to
his
father
and
go
with
him
to
montana
frasier
had
teams
and
wagons
for
freighting
and
hosstetter
some
capital
to
invest
in
freight
to
take
to
montana
frasier
advised
the
purchase
of
flour
and
he
would
freight
it
to
virginia
city
for
fifteen
dollars
per
cwt
he
said
flour
was
worth
fifty
and
sixty
dollars
per
hundred
in
virginia
city
so
it
was
in
the
spring
of
and
as
high
as
and
one
hundred
dollars
per
hundred
which
was
the
cause
of
a
bread
riot
in
virginia
city
no
doubt
frasier
was
honest
in
his
advice
and
would
have
invested
in
flour
for
himself
he
charged
more
freight
than
was
right
for
ten
and
twelve
cents
is
the
prevailing
price
but
then
hosstetter
should
have
found
that
out
for
himself
when
he
found
he
had
been
imposed
upon
and
learned
that
flour
is
retailing
at
virginia
city
for
per
hundred
he
was
angry
dissatisfied
and
perhaps
quarrelsome
frasier
was
no
doubt
very
aggravating
they
had
quarreled
several
times
and
the
evening
of
the
frasier
was
heard
to
say
to
hosstetter
in
a
threatening
tone
may
consider
yourself
lucky
if
you
ever
see
montana
you
need
not
expect
to
get
any
of
this
flour
it
will
take
it
all
to
pay
the
it
was
getting
dark
and
frasier
stood
with
one
hand
on
a
wheel
as
he
talked
he
then
got
into
the
wagon
and
out
again
with
something
in
his
hand
which
hosstetter
thought
was
a
revolver
in
the
gathering
darkness
he
came
back
to
the
wheel
where
he
had
been
standing
when
he
made
the
threat
and
hosstetter
thought
he
had
come
to
shoot
him
and
fired
twice
as
he
thought
to
save
his
own
life
frasier
fell
shot
through
the
brain
and
died
instantly
then
it
was
found
he
had
a
hatchet
in
his
hand
and
had
come
to
tighten
a
tire
on
the
wheel
which
he
had
found
loose
when
he
laid
his
hand
on
it
eldest
son
of
fourteen
years
is
here
there
are
five
children
and
their
mother
at
home
hosstetter
has
three
children
and
a
wife
eleven
innocent
persons
to
suffer
no
one
knows
how
intensely
for
that
rash
act
son
knelt
beside
his
dead
body
and
placing
his
hand
on
his
breast
he
swore
a
fearful
oath
that
he
would
have
but
one
purpose
in
life
until
his
death
is
avenged
oh
what
a
shocking
ambition
for
so
young
a
boy
frasier
and
hosstetter
have
traveled
and
camped
near
us
all
the
way
from
plattsmouth
when
the
train
was
organized
they
came
into
it
when
it
was
divided
they
went
with
the
others
as
there
were
not
so
many
of
them
and
the
herd
was
smaller
by
the
time
frank
and
i
had
discussed
the
direful
circumstances
connected
with
death
in
the
presence
of
this
greater
calamity
sickness
did
not
seem
so
sad
an
affliction
as
it
had
before
for
she
is
not
dead
and
while
there
is
life
there
is
hope
we
came
in
sight
of
three
corrals
about
eight
camping
near
together
tried
for
murder
everything
had
a
funereal
appearance
men
stood
around
in
small
groups
talking
earnestly
in
a
low
voice
whittling
sticks
the
incessant
occupation
of
most
men
when
trying
to
think
those
with
whom
we
are
acquainted
bowed
as
we
passed
them
without
speaking
i
was
soon
off
my
horse
and
ready
to
see
neelie
while
frank
took
dick
to
hitch
him
for
me
as
i
approached
the
tent
where
neelie
is
kerfoot
came
to
meet
me
is
she
aunt
mildred
i
asked
anxiously
think
perhaps
she
is
better
now
she
is
quiet
and
resting
easy
but
she
has
had
a
very
restless
night
and
the
doctor
says
she
must
be
kept
perfectly
quiet
not
the
least
she
had
led
me
away
from
the
tent
while
talking
i
saw
in
a
flash
what
she
meant
i
was
to
see
neelie
we
left
you
she
kept
asking
about
you
and
when
you
did
not
come
we
thought
perhaps
you
had
gone
the
short
cut
and
so
we
told
her
you
had
gone
the
short
cut
to
montana
and
we
would
not
see
you
any
more
she
seemed
grieved
at
first
but
became
reconciled
to
what
could
not
be
helped
and
now
if
she
should
see
you
of
course
it
would
excite
her
and
i
know
you
would
not
do
anything
that
might
harm
her
or
make
her
no
of
course
emma
delia
and
juddie
had
come
to
where
we
were
talking
i
kissed
them
all
said
and
came
away
with
a
heavy
heart
i
unhitched
dick
and
leading
him
by
the
bridle
went
on
in
advance
of
the
trains
selected
a
place
for
the
corral
unsaddled
dick
and
waited
for
the
wagons
i
did
not
have
long
to
wait
and
the
captain
was
so
good
as
to
corral
on
the
place
i
had
selected
i
had
a
motive
in
being
in
advance
of
the
other
trains
i
hoped
to
get
hillhouse
and
mother
to
consent
to
pull
out
of
corral
and
go
on
if
the
train
did
not
move
we
are
not
in
any
danger
from
indians
now
and
we
can
go
alone
if
no
others
choose
to
go
with
us
i
can
not
bear
to
stay
here
and
not
see
neelie
we
could
not
move
but
hillhouse
says
we
will
morning
the
men
from
these
four
trains
elected
judge
jury
prosecuting
attorney
and
lawyer
for
the
defense
and
have
tried
hosstetter
for
murder
the
jury
brought
in
a
verdict
of
he
shot
in
as
frasier
had
threatened
to
kill
him
hillhouse
served
on
a
jury
the
first
time
in
his
life
he
is
only
twenty
they
buried
frasier
yesterday
lyde
and
i
visited
his
grave
this
afternoon
hosstetter
seems
very
remorseful
blames
himself
for
being
so
hasty
sunday
august
we
were
up
bright
and
early
this
morning
by
the
time
other
camps
were
at
breakfast
we
were
ready
to
start
one
other
family
with
us
curry
his
wife
and
four
boys
when
hillhouse
spoke
to
the
captain
about
our
going
on
he
said
he
thought
it
advisable
as
our
teams
are
in
good
condition
the
cattle
not
at
all
lame
we
can
make
much
better
time
than
the
train
can
as
so
many
of
the
cattle
are
lame
they
will
be
obliged
to
travel
slowly
there
is
no
danger
from
indians
and
after
we
reach
green
river
pasture
will
be
plentiful
without
going
away
from
camp
to
find
it
i
climbed
into
wagon
to
tell
her
kissed
little
annie
as
she
was
sweetly
sleeping
seemed
sorry
to
have
us
go
i
met
fletcher
as
i
was
leaving
hardinbrooke
and
asked
about
neelie
is
very
low
indeed
of
course
while
there
is
life
we
may
hope
but
if
she
lives
they
will
have
to
stay
here
a
week
or
ten
i
did
not
tell
him
we
were
leaving
but
said
good
morning
and
went
to
find
lyde
she
was
worried
and
anxious
about
milt
he
has
been
staying
behind
the
train
to
drive
lame
oxen
almost
every
day
since
he
has
been
well
enough
he
is
usually
in
camp
by
last
night
he
did
not
come
she
said
joe
is
quite
sick
too
i
wonder
what
will
happen
next
lyde
no
very
serious
calamity
has
happened
to
you
or
yours
nor
me
or
mine
let
us
not
borrow
trouble
but
hope
for
the
best
milt
will
be
here
in
a
little
while
i
know
he
is
able
to
take
care
of
himself
and
he
is
going
to
do
we
leave
the
train
the
wagons
had
started
so
i
mounted
dick
and
was
off
as
i
came
into
the
road
i
looked
back
and
saw
milt
coming
in
sight
driving
his
lame
oxen
i
left
the
road
once
more
and
went
to
grave
his
son
has
set
it
with
prickly
pears
so
closely
that
it
will
make
a
pretty
mound
if
it
grows
and
will
be
a
protection
from
wolves
unless
their
hides
are
thick
and
tough
poor
boy
he
must
have
been
seriously
scratched
while
transplanting
the
prickly
things
but
perhaps
it
was
a
relief
to
his
mental
suffering
to
bear
physical
pain
while
trying
to
do
a
last
something
for
his
poor
father
i
spent
a
dreary
morning
i
feel
the
parting
with
our
friends
so
distressingly
it
is
not
likely
we
will
meet
again
in
this
life
i
think
sim
is
feeling
blue
over
it
too
we
met
a
squad
of
soldiers
from
green
river
going
to
arrest
hosstetter
and
take
him
to
fort
bridger
for
trial
they
say
his
trial
was
not
legal
he
and
all
the
witnesses
will
have
to
go
by
the
way
of
fort
bridger
and
will
perhaps
be
detained
for
some
time
i
do
hope
for
his
own
and
his
sake
he
will
be
cleared
the
upper
road
from
rock
springs
goes
by
the
way
of
fort
bridger
i
think
for
the
soldiers
spoke
as
if
it
was
not
on
this
road
we
arrived
at
green
river
about
three
the
river
is
about
as
wide
deep
and
swift
as
the
north
platte
yet
i
have
not
dreaded
any
of
the
rivers
we
have
crossed
as
i
did
dread
to
ford
this
one
perhaps
it
was
because
there
are
so
few
of
us
for
in
numbers
there
is
a
feeling
of
security
even
in
crossing
deep
and
dangerous
streams
we
crossed
without
accident
or
loss
and
are
camping
on
the
west
bank
of
green
river
when
we
first
came
to
the
river
one
of
boys
exclaimed
this
river
is
named
right
if
i
had
been
going
to
name
it
i
believe
i
would
have
named
it
green
river
too
for
it
is
the
water
is
very
clear
yet
the
river
has
a
appearance
i
do
not
understand
why
there
are
several
corrals
along
the
river
but
the
people
are
strangers
so
we
feel
very
much
alone
there
is
a
station
here
and
tents
within
sight
we
are
camping
on
blue
grass
with
the
mountains
very
close
they
are
the
highest
i
have
seen
i
would
like
to
climb
to
the
top
but
mother
says
there
are
too
many
soldiers
and
strangers
around
at
the
foot
of
the
mountain
a
little
way
from
our
camp
there
is
a
graveyard
with
about
a
dozen
graves
it
is
a
beautiful
spot
with
the
mountain
for
an
enduring
monument
several
of
the
graves
have
been
made
this
year
with
names
and
dates
quite
distinct
on
the
plain
pine
headboards
others
are
entirely
worn
or
washed
off
by
the
relentless
hand
of
time
and
storm
it
seems
that
bitter
creek
was
too
much
for
the
weak
or
frail
constitutions
like
moses
they
were
permitted
to
look
upon
the
better
land
before
they
died
monday
august
the
soldiers
brought
hosstetter
here
in
the
night
and
i
suppose
the
witnesses
came
too
i
wanted
to
go
to
the
station
to
see
if
i
could
hear
anything
from
neelie
and
the
rest
of
the
sick
folks
but
mother
did
not
want
me
to
go
where
there
are
so
many
soldiers
so
i
did
not
go
we
started
very
early
this
morning
and
have
driven
about
twenty
miles
are
camping
on
black
fork
where
the
horses
and
cattle
are
just
wading
in
fine
pasture
right
around
camp
we
ascended
a
mountain
this
morning
that
was
seven
miles
from
base
to
summit
the
way
the
road
is
we
had
toilsome
climbing
and
i
guess
the
teams
found
it
a
hard
road
to
travel
before
we
reached
the
top
i
came
on
in
advance
of
the
wagons
sometimes
riding
and
sometimes
leading
dick
where
it
was
very
steep
and
had
time
to
enjoy
the
magnificent
scenery
that
lay
spread
out
on
all
sides
the
snowy
range
could
be
seen
in
the
distance
glittering
in
the
morning
sunshine
the
wild
currants
are
here
in
abundance
i
am
going
fishing
with
the
boys
so
i
must
be
off
wild
currants
galore
tuesday
august
we
caught
fish
enough
for
breakfast
last
evening
and
gathered
currants
enough
for
sauce
but
i
spoilt
the
sauce
by
putting
the
sugar
in
when
i
put
them
on
to
cook
they
hardened
and
were
not
fit
to
eat
i
have
been
experimenting
and
have
succeeded
in
making
a
nice
cobbler
i
did
not
sweeten
at
all
before
baking
but
made
the
sauce
sweet
enough
to
sweeten
all
i
also
made
a
fine
sauce
by
cooking
the
currants
only
a
very
few
minutes
and
putting
in
the
sugar
after
they
were
cooked
we
will
have
currant
dumplings
for
dinner
we
have
picked
a
lot
enough
to
make
sauce
and
pies
and
other
good
things
for
a
week
the
currants
are
a
beautiful
fruit
and
some
are
as
large
as
small
cherries
we
are
waiting
at
camp
plentiful
in
the
hope
that
some
of
the
wagons
from
the
train
will
drive
in
before
night
there
are
three
wigwams
within
sight
of
our
camp
sim
and
hillhouse
went
hunting
on
their
way
back
they
stopped
at
the
wigwams
and
found
them
occupied
by
white
men
with
squaws
for
wives
ugh
wednesday
august
somehow
i
felt
a
little
suspicious
of
those
white
men
living
with
squaws
and
feared
some
of
our
horses
might
be
missing
this
morning
but
my
suspicions
were
groundless
our
horses
and
cattle
were
all
here
well
fed
and
ready
for
a
long
drive
we
were
off
bright
and
early
without
seeing
any
one
from
the
train
we
passed
the
bridger
road
where
our
friends
going
to
california
will
turn
off
so
we
are
not
likely
to
see
them
again
perhaps
for
years
perhaps
never
again
in
this
life
there
is
a
very
fine
ranch
at
the
junction
of
the
roads
where
we
stopped
at
noon
two
men
from
this
ranch
visited
our
camp
this
evening
they
were
rather
fine
looking
genteel
in
appearance
dressed
in
civilization
style
but
for
some
unexplainable
reason
i
was
afraid
of
them
they
tried
to
be
very
cordial
and
polite
they
engaged
sim
in
conversation
and
plied
him
with
pertinent
questions
such
as
owns
those
big
american
mares
referring
to
our
horse
team
are
the
property
of
a
bay
pony
is
that
belongs
to
the
is
the
owner
of
that
chestnut
sorrel
curry
father
of
those
boys
playing
over
they
asked
many
more
questions
where
we
came
from
where
we
are
going
what
we
expect
to
do
etc
sim
answered
them
patiently
and
civilly
he
thinks
they
are
horse
thieves
but
hopes
they
will
not
be
mean
enough
to
steal
from
a
widow
as
if
horse
thieves
care
who
they
steal
from
no
doubt
their
ranch
is
stocked
with
stolen
horses
and
cattle
for
they
have
things
as
they
choose
away
out
here
where
there
is
no
law
except
the
law
of
might
word
says
the
partridge
sitteth
on
eggs
and
hatcheth
them
not
so
he
that
getteth
riches
and
not
by
right
shall
leave
them
in
the
midst
of
his
days
and
at
his
end
shall
be
a
jer
we
are
camping
on
fork
where
the
currants
and
fish
are
very
plentiful
and
the
pasture
very
fine
we
had
our
currant
dumplings
for
dinner
they
were
lovely
no
one
can
imagine
how
we
appreciate
this
fruit
by
the
wayside
except
those
who
have
been
deprived
of
the
strawberries
raspberries
blackberries
and
cherries
each
in
their
season
and
confined
to
the
sameness
and
tameness
of
diet
which
people
making
this
trip
are
necessarily
confined
to
this
fruit
would
seem
inferior
among
other
cultivated
fruits
but
where
it
is
it
seems
a
luxury
provided
for
our
benefit
thursday
august
we
went
fishing
at
noon
it
is
such
fun
to
fish
in
water
so
clear
that
we
can
see
the
fish
biting
at
the
hook
they
do
not
seem
at
all
afraid
and
sometimes
there
will
be
two
three
or
four
grabbing
at
the
hook
at
the
same
time
such
shoving
pushing
and
crowding
as
they
all
try
to
get
the
tempting
bait
how
eager
and
unsuspecting
they
are
soon
the
strongest
or
fleetest
or
rather
the
most
unfortunate
one
seizes
it
away
goes
bait
hook
and
all
and
then
out
comes
a
fish
on
dry
land
i
give
a
shiver
of
pity
for
the
unlucky
fish
as
i
call
to
the
boys
have
it
does
seem
such
a
cruel
thing
to
take
them
from
their
pleasant
home
in
the
deep
clear
cool
water
but
then
is
sustained
by
and
thousands
upon
thousands
of
lives
are
taken
daily
to
nourish
and
sustain
human
life
we
are
in
a
beautiful
place
where
all
things
necessary
for
camping
are
plentiful
and
we
are
all
alone
no
corral
within
sight
the
first
time
we
have
been
entirely
alone
friday
august
one
or
other
of
the
boys
stood
guard
last
night
it
proved
an
unnecessary
precaution
there
was
no
disturbance
either
from
horse
thieves
indians
or
wild
beasts
we
are
living
fine
since
we
crossed
green
river
we
have
fresh
fish
for
breakfast
and
sometimes
for
dinner
wild
game
of
some
kind
for
dinner
with
currant
pudding
cobbler
or
dumplings
with
rich
cream
for
dessert
we
may
possibly
go
hungry
next
winter
at
virginia
city
but
there
is
no
danger
of
starving
while
we
stay
on
fork
the
weather
is
perfect
i
have
been
riding
my
pony
the
greater
part
of
the
day
sometimes
one
of
little
boys
with
me
and
sometimes
alone
i
have
enjoyed
the
delightful
atmosphere
it
seems
so
pure
and
invigorating
the
scenery
is
beautiful
and
it
has
been
a
glorious
day
horse
stolen
saturday
august
it
was
considered
unnecessary
for
any
one
to
stand
guard
last
night
as
we
had
come
two
travel
from
where
the
suspicious
characters
live
so
all
went
to
bed
retired
early
slept
soundly
and
even
neglected
to
put
rug
in
its
usual
place
under
our
wagon
so
he
went
into
the
tent
with
boys
to
find
a
comfortable
bed
leaving
the
camp
entirely
unguarded
one
of
our
big
horses
wears
a
bell
i
was
awakened
in
the
night
by
hearing
an
unusual
rattling
and
the
horses
came
galloping
up
to
the
wagons
dick
whinnied
i
raised
the
wagon
cover
and
spoke
to
him
and
he
commenced
cropping
the
grass
the
other
horses
were
in
sight
but
not
eating
they
seemed
frightened
and
just
then
cæsar
came
tearing
out
of
the
tent
and
ran
toward
the
road
barking
fiercely
the
moon
was
shining
brightly
i
looked
out
at
the
back
of
the
wagon
but
could
not
discover
anything
wrong
but
evidently
there
was
something
wrong
for
horse
was
gone
this
morning
curry
sim
and
hillhouse
have
been
hunting
the
horse
all
day
but
without
success
except
to
find
certain
evidence
that
it
had
been
stolen
they
found
the
where
three
horses
had
been
tied
for
some
time
they
then
found
where
four
horses
had
traveled
so
they
concluded
there
were
three
men
after
the
horses
the
boys
think
it
was
the
merest
accident
that
our
horses
are
not
gone
too
but
i
believe
it
was
providential
care
that
kept
them
for
us
curry
is
anxious
to
stay
and
try
to
recover
his
horse
i
believe
as
the
boys
do
that
it
will
be
a
waste
of
effort
for
if
men
are
mean
enough
to
steal
a
horse
they
will
manage
to
keep
it
but
we
do
not
like
to
offer
too
many
objections
as
it
might
seem
like
selfishness
on
our
part
as
we
are
not
the
losers
oh
dear
why
people
be
good
and
do
as
they
would
be
done
by
how
much
happier
this
world
would
be
if
there
were
no
thieves
nor
wicked
people
in
it
i
know
it
is
hard
for
curry
to
give
up
his
fine
horse
without
making
an
effort
to
get
it
back
yet
i
feel
sure
he
will
not
get
it
for
if
he
found
it
he
could
not
force
the
thieves
to
give
it
to
him
anxiously
waiting
at
fork
sunday
august
it
was
decided
this
morning
that
hillhouse
sim
and
curry
would
go
in
pursuit
of
the
horse
thieves
sim
is
just
recovering
from
a
severe
sickness
and
is
not
able
to
go
on
such
a
trip
but
he
positively
refused
to
stay
in
camp
and
let
hillhouse
and
curry
go
without
him
i
believe
it
will
prove
a
wild
goose
chase
so
mother
and
i
exacted
a
promise
from
hillhouse
that
he
will
not
stay
away
we
are
looking
for
him
it
is
getting
dark
surely
they
will
not
leave
us
here
in
this
wilderness
with
only
two
boys
and
cæsar
for
protection
if
we
are
left
alone
i
shall
take
my
turn
with
winthrop
and
alex
curry
standing
guard
in
camp
sim
rode
dick
this
morning
the
others
walked
what
they
expect
to
do
if
they
find
the
thieves
which
they
are
not
likely
to
do
i
do
not
know
and
kennedy
and
bower
nellie
and
alton
and
teams
passed
here
they
left
the
train
the
next
morning
after
we
did
the
train
had
not
started
then
they
said
neelie
was
about
as
when
we
left
and
hardinbrooke
was
no
worse
monday
august
hillhouse
came
in
about
an
hour
after
dark
he
was
very
tired
and
hungry
had
walked
since
early
morning
until
he
started
back
at
three
he
tried
to
prevail
upon
sim
to
return
and
let
him
go
on
with
curry
if
he
must
go
but
sim
would
not
listen
to
such
a
proposition
although
he
is
still
weak
from
his
late
sickness
curry
thinks
he
will
find
his
horse
at
the
ranch
near
the
junction
although
the
trail
they
were
following
led
away
from
instead
of
toward
it
if
he
finds
it
he
will
go
back
to
the
train
and
get
the
men
to
help
him
get
it
either
by
fair
means
or
by
force
he
then
proposed
that
they
keep
dick
but
they
said
he
would
not
reach
camp
before
midnight
on
foot
and
he
might
lose
his
way
but
dick
would
take
him
the
shortest
route
if
he
would
just
let
him
go
his
own
way
which
he
did
and
he
brought
him
safe
about
an
hour
after
dark
i
am
so
sorry
for
curry
she
tries
to
be
brave
for
her
sake
but
any
one
can
see
she
suffers
and
alex
says
she
does
not
eat
at
all
just
takes
a
cup
of
tea
once
in
a
while
tuesday
august
another
day
has
come
and
gone
and
the
wanderers
have
not
returned
hillhouse
said
he
did
not
expect
them
but
would
look
for
them
for
they
will
not
have
anything
to
eat
after
and
will
be
obliged
to
leave
the
foot
hills
and
come
to
the
road
whether
they
find
the
horse
or
not
to
get
something
to
eat
a
party
of
emigrants
stopped
near
us
at
noon
and
one
of
the
men
came
to
our
camp
we
of
course
asked
if
they
had
seen
the
hardinbrooke
train
they
passed
the
train
sunday
they
were
still
where
we
left
them
at
the
west
end
of
bitter
creek
he
saw
and
talked
to
the
captain
who
told
him
to
tell
us
if
he
caught
up
with
us
sick
folks
are
all
better
and
they
expect
to
come
to
green
river
they
may
catch
up
with
us
yet
i
do
not
know
what
we
would
do
with
ourselves
if
it
were
not
for
the
currants
we
are
making
jelly
and
as
it
takes
lots
of
currants
to
make
a
little
jelly
we
have
not
suffered
from
enforced
idleness
with
our
suspense
and
anxiety
wednesday
august
there
are
three
varieties
of
currants
here
the
yellow
ones
are
not
very
plentiful
they
are
the
largest
and
best
i
have
made
a
pickle
jar
full
of
the
loveliest
jelly
it
is
the
color
of
gold
and
as
clear
as
crystal
the
red
currants
are
very
plentiful
and
more
like
the
tame
currants
though
they
do
not
yield
as
much
juice
we
gather
the
bushes
by
the
armful
and
carry
them
to
camp
and
sitting
near
each
other
we
pick
off
the
currants
though
we
do
not
talk
much
we
like
to
be
near
each
other
another
day
and
they
have
not
come
and
another
night
of
anxiety
before
us
the
return
thursday
august
i
was
awakened
very
early
this
morning
as
soon
as
it
was
light
by
hearing
hillhouse
bustling
about
making
a
fire
in
the
stove
as
if
in
a
hurry
for
his
breakfast
i
dressed
as
quickly
as
possible
and
hastened
out
to
see
what
it
meant
for
it
was
only
four
when
i
asked
for
an
explanation
he
said
am
going
to
hunt
those
men
i
stand
this
any
longer
i
have
laid
awake
almost
all
night
thinking
about
can
you
do
you
will
be
lost
danger
of
that
i
will
go
back
on
the
road
as
far
as
green
river
get
some
of
the
soldiers
and
some
of
the
boys
that
know
them
and
we
will
hunt
until
we
find
them
or
know
what
has
become
of
them
i
may
meet
them
on
the
road
and
return
but
i
will
not
come
until
i
bring
them
with
me
or
know
their
i
could
not
object
to
his
going
but
oh
how
my
heart
sank
at
the
thought
we
made
all
haste
to
get
breakfast
and
hillhouse
was
all
ready
to
start
when
curry
and
the
boys
came
out
curry
seemed
both
glad
and
sorry
he
was
going
said
she
hardly
knew
which
i
had
supplied
him
with
pencil
and
paper
and
he
promised
to
send
us
word
every
opportunity
he
mounted
dick
and
rode
away
without
saying
he
had
gone
almost
out
of
sight
one
moment
more
and
a
bend
in
the
road
would
hide
him
from
our
view
when
lo
there
is
a
gun
fired
not
far
off
my
thought
was
indians
and
i
looked
to
see
if
hillhouse
was
hurt
he
was
waving
his
hat
furiously
and
came
tearing
back
to
camp
then
i
heard
curry
cry
out
it
is
my
and
she
dropped
in
a
heap
on
the
ground
and
cried
out
loud
they
were
plainly
visible
by
that
time
coming
over
the
hill
and
down
to
the
creek
and
through
it
before
any
one
could
show
them
where
they
could
cross
without
getting
wet
all
was
excitement
for
a
while
the
meeting
between
curry
and
his
family
was
very
touching
indeed
i
think
curry
had
about
lost
all
hope
of
ever
seeing
him
again
how
famished
and
worn
out
they
did
seem
to
be
sim
was
utterly
exhausted
i
do
not
believe
he
could
have
gone
another
half
mile
we
gave
sim
a
bowl
of
bread
and
milk
and
a
cup
of
coffee
then
the
boys
helped
him
to
bed
in
our
wagon
because
it
is
on
springs
and
we
expected
to
start
before
he
waked
within
one
hour
after
they
reached
camp
sim
was
sleeping
the
sleep
of
exhaustion
we
did
not
ask
any
questions
nor
let
him
talk
at
all
before
he
went
to
sleep
curry
prepared
the
best
breakfast
the
camp
could
afford
for
her
husband
and
as
the
family
had
not
breakfasted
they
all
sat
down
together
she
came
for
sim
to
take
breakfast
with
them
but
he
was
sound
asleep
and
i
would
not
have
had
him
awakened
for
the
best
breakfast
ever
prepared
perhaps
curry
can
stand
eating
such
a
meal
after
starving
so
long
but
i
believe
it
would
kill
sim
in
his
weak
condition
for
he
is
not
fully
recovered
from
his
recent
illness
we
made
all
haste
to
start
once
more
and
by
eight
were
on
the
way
we
had
left
the
camp
where
we
spent
five
such
anxious
distressful
days
sim
did
not
awaken
until
after
ten
we
gave
him
some
fish
and
bread
and
milk
which
we
had
ready
for
him
when
he
had
eaten
he
lay
in
bed
and
told
mother
and
i
the
following
narrative
of
what
had
befallen
them
since
they
left
camp
story
of
their
wanderings
hill
left
us
that
first
afternoon
we
walked
on
as
fast
as
we
could
as
long
as
we
could
follow
the
trail
then
made
a
fire
ate
some
supper
without
anything
to
drink
we
had
not
seen
water
since
noon
rolled
up
in
our
blankets
and
lay
down
with
our
feet
to
the
fire
and
tried
to
sleep
i
am
sure
i
did
not
sleep
an
hour
i
was
so
tired
and
nervous
as
soon
as
it
was
light
enough
to
see
we
were
up
and
ate
a
dry
breakfast
for
we
could
find
no
water
in
the
vicinity
we
were
soon
following
the
trail
before
night
we
had
eaten
all
our
grub
and
found
no
water
oh
what
would
i
have
given
for
a
cup
of
cold
water
it
seemed
that
we
must
find
water
or
perish
we
dragged
on
as
long
as
we
could
see
then
lay
down
and
slept
from
exhaustion
when
we
awoke
it
was
light
was
so
weak
that
curry
had
to
help
me
to
get
on
my
feet
i
declared
i
could
go
no
further
curry
prevailed
on
me
to
try
for
we
must
be
near
green
river
i
made
a
desperate
effort
and
dragged
on
for
half
a
mile
perhaps
curry
carrying
my
blanket
when
i
positively
could
go
no
further
and
told
curry
to
go
on
and
leave
me
and
try
to
save
himself
curry
was
desperate
he
said
must
find
something
to
he
covered
me
with
the
blankets
and
went
to
look
for
some
kind
of
game
he
had
gone
about
a
hundred
yards
he
saw
a
bird
about
the
size
of
a
partridge
sitting
on
a
limb
ready
to
be
shot
he
took
careful
aim
and
shot
its
head
off
he
hastened
back
to
where
i
lay
made
a
fire
skinned
the
bird
and
held
it
on
a
sharpened
stick
before
the
fire
and
roasted
it
thoroughly
i
would
have
eaten
it
when
half
done
but
curry
would
not
let
me
have
it
until
well
cooked
for
fear
it
would
make
me
sick
never
tasted
fowl
that
tasted
so
good
as
that
did
although
we
ate
it
without
salt
after
eating
i
felt
better
and
made
another
effort
to
move
on
we
had
gone
only
a
little
way
when
curry
stopped
listened
a
moment
and
exclaimed
hear
the
rushing
of
the
river
could
not
hear
it
at
first
but
soon
i
heard
the
glad
sound
too
it
gave
us
courage
and
with
renewed
energy
we
pushed
on
and
before
eleven
we
reached
the
river
we
slacked
our
thirst
cautiously
at
first
then
had
a
bath
and
were
refreshed
i
rested
on
the
bank
curry
looked
up
and
down
the
river
for
the
trail
which
had
gone
into
the
river
he
did
not
find
it
we
then
started
for
the
road
which
we
came
into
in
about
an
hour
just
below
the
ranch
at
the
junction
party
of
emigrants
had
stopped
for
noon
who
gladly
gave
food
and
refreshment
to
us
weary
wanderers
while
i
was
resting
curry
investigated
the
ranch
looked
among
the
horses
in
the
pasture
peeped
in
stables
but
did
not
find
his
horse
b
b
those
men
at
the
junction
did
steal
horse
the
men
in
the
hardinbrooke
train
saw
them
in
their
corral
and
asked
did
you
get
that
horse
they
answered
a
man
by
the
name
of
curry
paid
for
curry
had
given
up
getting
his
horse
he
was
all
eagerness
to
get
back
to
his
family
but
considering
how
very
weak
i
was
he
consented
to
stay
with
the
kind
people
we
had
fallen
in
with
until
morning
so
we
traveled
with
them
and
i
rested
in
a
wagon
all
afternoon
the
first
peep
of
dawn
curry
was
up
and
awakened
me
i
felt
refreshed
and
ready
for
our
early
walk
curry
explored
the
found
some
bread
and
meat
which
he
appropriated
leaving
to
pay
for
our
entertainment
expected
to
reach
camp
by
ten
but
i
gave
completely
out
and
we
were
obliged
to
lie
down
and
rest
when
about
five
miles
from
camp
i
slept
until
awakened
this
morning
before
it
was
light
by
curry
who
was
so
anxious
to
be
on
the
way
i
wondered
that
he
let
me
sleep
so
long
came
over
the
instead
of
by
the
road
and
saved
about
a
mile
in
distance
we
saw
hill
riding
away
from
camp
and
felt
sure
he
was
starting
to
try
and
find
us
curry
fired
his
gun
to
attract
his
attention
and
you
know
the
he
turned
over
and
went
to
sleep
again
and
slept
until
we
stopped
for
noon
we
made
a
long
drive
and
are
camping
at
the
foot
of
bear
river
mountain
we
had
a
hard
rain
and
hail
storm
this
afternoon
it
was
very
violent
while
it
lasted
and
we
halted
by
the
roadside
until
it
was
over
it
was
over
in
half
an
hour
curry
has
suffered
with
a
severe
headache
and
high
fever
all
day
the
result
of
that
hearty
breakfast
this
morning
after
fasting
so
long
bear
river
mountain
friday
at
noon
august
i
am
on
the
summit
of
bear
river
mountain
in
the
border
of
a
beautiful
grove
of
pine
and
near
a
spring
of
the
most
delicious
water
i
must
be
some
miles
ahead
of
the
wagons
that
i
left
toiling
up
the
steep
mountain
side
yet
i
do
not
feel
that
i
am
alone
oh
no
i
feel
that
god
is
here
in
his
might
majesty
power
and
glory
i
feel
his
nearness
now
and
as
i
gaze
from
these
dizzy
heights
upon
the
country
spread
out
beneath
my
feet
i
am
lost
in
admiration
the
scene
is
so
grand
so
magnificent
that
i
forget
my
own
vanity
and
nothingness
i
feel
that
i
am
standing
upon
an
altar
raised
by
grateful
hand
up
to
god
and
that
i
could
offer
myself
a
willing
sacrifice
this
is
emphatically
one
of
the
high
and
sacred
spots
of
earth
how
manifold
how
wonderful
are
the
works
of
nature
everywhere
something
worthy
of
our
highest
admiration
is
presented
to
view
everywhere
do
we
see
the
manifestation
of
an
invisible
and
omnipotent
creator
the
terrific
storm
the
broad
prairies
the
majestic
forest
excite
within
our
bosoms
emotions
of
awe
and
admiration
yet
there
are
no
places
on
earth
that
i
have
seen
which
have
a
tendency
to
inspire
me
with
such
tender
feelings
such
elevated
pure
holy
thoughts
as
mountains
oh
it
seems
that
one
could
never
sin
or
have
an
evil
thought
in
such
a
place
as
this
behold
the
mountains
as
they
stand
upon
their
broad
bases
contemplate
them
as
they
rear
their
snowy
tops
in
awful
majestic
grandeur
above
the
clouds
view
them
as
you
will
and
they
ever
present
the
same
untiring
pleasure
to
the
mind
men
and
women
will
travel
thousands
of
miles
and
make
the
greatest
exertion
to
climb
the
rugged
steeps
of
mountains
to
enjoy
for
one
short
hour
the
charming
prospect
i
have
wondered
at
this
sometimes
as
i
have
read
of
their
hazardous
exploits
in
trying
to
obtain
a
point
where
they
could
have
the
finest
view
but
i
never
shall
again
a
country
destitute
of
mountains
may
be
fertile
and
productive
of
all
that
conduces
to
human
happiness
yet
it
will
lack
the
essential
of
attractive
moral
grandeur
it
may
enchant
the
imagination
for
a
moment
to
look
over
prairies
and
plains
as
far
as
the
eye
can
reach
still
such
a
view
is
tedious
and
monotonous
it
can
in
no
wise
produce
that
rapturing
delight
that
pleasing
variety
of
the
sublime
and
beautiful
of
landscape
scenery
which
mountains
afford
let
those
whose
tastes
are
on
a
level
with
the
ground
they
tread
feel
proud
of
and
admire
their
prairie
fields
but
give
to
me
a
mountain
home
the
wagons
are
almost
at
the
top
and
as
mother
has
driven
up
the
steep
ascent
i
will
drive
down
the
western
slope
and
have
mother
ride
dick
and
enjoy
the
delightsome
scenery
as
we
descend
the
which
looks
very
steep
from
here
we
were
all
the
evening
crossing
the
mountain
and
it
was
a
hard
drive
we
are
camping
at
the
foot
of
the
mountain
near
a
spring
in
bear
river
valley
within
calling
distance
of
the
chilicothe
train
we
passed
two
freight
wagons
on
the
that
were
rather
badly
smashed
up
one
had
upset
and
crackers
in
a
condition
and
other
debris
from
family
groceries
were
scattered
about
we
learned
that
the
wagons
are
and
he
has
gone
somewhere
to
get
the
wheels
mended
we
are
quite
disappointed
that
he
is
away
for
sim
is
not
so
well
as
he
was
yesterday
has
had
fever
and
been
flighty
and
in
a
stupor
this
afternoon
he
needs
medical
treatment
and
we
hoped
to
have
yager
prescribe
for
him
we
passed
eight
graves
on
the
mountain
one
a
young
lady
twenty
years
old
from
monroe
county
missouri
a
beautiful
resting
place
for
the
dead
yager
is
quite
sick
and
seems
sadly
disheartened
thinks
crossing
the
plains
and
mountains
in
a
wagon
they
have
a
very
comfortable
carriage
is
a
sad
discouraging
experiment
i
am
sorry
she
could
not
enjoy
the
fine
prospect
on
the
for
she
is
a
lady
who
would
appreciate
such
grandeur
to
the
fullest
under
favorable
circumstances
we
reached
level
ground
without
accident
and
were
glad
to
come
up
with
friends
we
had
met
before
on
the
road
we
meet
captain
brother
saturday
august
we
left
the
chilicothe
train
this
morning
as
it
will
take
all
day
to
get
the
wagons
mended
they
can
not
start
we
came
on
to
bear
river
reached
here
a
little
after
noon
and
will
stay
here
until
we
crossed
a
toll
bridge
on
fork
and
met
captain
brother
at
the
bridge
he
is
going
to
meet
the
train
he
did
not
know
of
illness
he
asked
very
especially
and
with
some
confusion
miss
walker
well
ah
i
think
i
know
who
he
is
going
to
meet
and
understand
some
things
that
have
not
been
very
clear
to
me
before
ha
miss
lyde
you
have
guarded
your
secret
well
but
see
if
i
have
not
guessed
it
now
well
he
is
very
nice
looking
and
if
he
makes
as
good
a
husband
as
his
brother
he
will
no
doubt
be
worth
coming
to
montana
for
i
wish
you
joy
and
that
i
may
be
present
at
the
wedding
festivities
the
boys
have
gone
fishing
all
but
sim
poor
boy
he
is
too
sick
again
i
feel
very
much
out
of
patience
with
curry
because
of
the
tramp
he
led
sim
when
in
so
weak
a
condition
sunday
august
we
passed
a
grave
this
morning
that
was
made
yesterday
for
a
young
mother
and
her
babe
oh
how
sad
with
what
an
aching
heart
must
that
husband
and
father
go
on
his
weary
way
leaving
his
loved
ones
by
the
roadside
we
crossed
another
toll
bridge
it
seems
to
me
that
emigrants
are
greatly
imposed
upon
by
these
men
who
claim
toll
they
throw
a
very
poor
excuse
of
a
bridge
across
a
stream
that
could
be
easily
forded
if
let
alone
but
they
spoil
the
crossing
by
digging
ditches
and
throwing
in
bush
and
timbers
to
obstruct
the
fording
then
build
a
cabin
close
to
the
bridge
and
squat
to
make
a
fortune
by
extorting
large
toll
from
emigrants
who
have
not
the
time
to
stop
and
contend
for
their
rights
it
seems
a
shameful
business
while
stopping
at
noon
we
saw
a
company
of
indians
coming
down
the
road
toward
our
wagons
my
first
sensation
was
fear
but
upon
reflection
i
knew
that
is
not
the
way
they
go
on
the
warpath
and
by
the
time
they
reached
camp
i
was
ready
to
say
and
try
to
talk
to
them
there
was
one
that
could
understand
english
and
talked
quite
well
they
are
bannocks
the
tribe
that
was
conquered
in
idaho
some
years
ago
their
chief
was
with
them
he
held
a
stiff
neck
and
tried
to
look
dignified
and
only
looked
ridiculous
they
are
going
on
a
buffalo
hunt
it
seems
that
the
whole
tribe
are
going
squaws
pappooses
and
all
we
have
been
meeting
them
all
afternoon
and
are
camping
with
them
all
around
us
they
all
seem
to
want
my
pony
i
have
been
asked
at
least
twenty
times
this
afternoon
to
i
gave
all
the
same
answer
why
i
would
not
give
my
dick
for
twenty
of
their
ponies
the
squaws
and
pappooses
are
around
our
camp
begging
biscuit
they
are
the
greatest
beggars
i
ever
saw
i
do
wonder
if
they
are
hungry
we
crossed
the
steepest
straight
up
and
down
mountain
that
we
have
crossed
yet
it
seemed
that
the
wagons
would
turn
a
somersault
as
we
were
making
the
descent
sim
was
too
sick
to
sit
up
and
he
would
slide
down
in
a
heap
bed
bedclothes
and
all
against
the
seat
and
we
stopped
twice
to
have
him
helped
back
into
place
when
we
reached
level
ground
he
was
all
piled
up
again
poor
sim
he
is
very
sick
i
do
wish
we
could
come
across
a
physician
we
have
administered
simple
remedies
but
seemingly
without
effect
there
is
an
old
lady
years
old
in
a
train
camping
near
us
she
is
cheerful
as
a
lark
sings
sometimes
and
is
an
incessant
talker
she
says
she
is
going
to
oregon
where
she
expects
to
renew
her
youth
she
looks
very
old
and
wrinkled
in
the
face
but
is
very
active
in
her
movements
and
not
at
all
stooped
the
people
she
is
with
are
not
at
all
refined
or
cultured
but
i
do
like
to
talk
to
the
old
lady
she
is
so
quaint
it
makes
mother
seem
quite
a
young
woman
to
see
her
with
an
old
lady
more
than
forty
years
older
than
she
is
why
she
seems
just
in
the
prime
of
life
and
we
had
thought
her
growing
old
mormon
towns
in
idaho
monday
august
since
we
crossed
the
last
steep
mountain
the
horse
flies
have
been
very
troublesome
the
first
that
have
bothered
us
all
summer
i
wonder
if
the
indians
brought
them
we
came
through
two
villages
they
are
about
five
miles
apart
the
first
bennington
the
last
montpelier
pretty
large
names
for
such
small
places
they
are
mormon
towns
although
this
is
idaho
territory
the
women
appeared
sad
and
sorrowful
enough
to
be
the
wives
of
mormons
i
did
not
see
one
of
them
smile
our
wagons
were
thronged
with
women
and
children
selling
butter
eggs
cheese
and
vegetables
they
sold
eggs
at
cents
per
dozen
butter
seventy
cents
per
pound
cheese
fifty
cents
potatoes
cents
and
everything
else
in
proportion
the
prices
seemed
enormous
to
us
but
i
presume
we
would
have
purchased
if
they
had
been
double
what
they
were
for
we
are
about
starved
for
such
things
just
think
of
spending
a
whole
summer
without
garden
productions
this
is
a
beautiful
valley
too
good
to
be
possessed
by
a
community
of
bigamists
what
a
stigma
upon
the
government
of
these
united
states
that
whole
communities
are
allowed
to
live
criminal
lives
with
impunity
i
wonder
how
many
are
paying
the
penalty
for
bigamy
in
the
penitentiaries
of
the
united
states
what
is
crime
in
one
place
under
the
same
government
i
would
think
would
be
crime
in
all
other
places
if
the
one
did
happen
to
be
an
isolated
case
while
the
other
is
in
large
numbers
or
wholesale
i
suppose
i
am
not
well
enough
versed
in
law
and
politics
to
understand
why
it
is
crime
in
one
place
and
not
in
the
other
we
are
camping
eight
miles
from
montpelier
sim
is
much
better
tuesday
august
here
we
are
at
soda
springs
i
am
surprised
to
see
so
small
a
town
for
it
is
quite
an
old
place
for
this
western
country
at
least
ten
or
fifteen
years
old
and
does
not
have
a
the
town
is
beautifully
situated
the
landscape
views
are
glorious
the
soda
springs
are
bubbling
up
out
of
the
ground
in
many
places
in
this
vicinity
and
i
expect
there
will
be
a
city
here
some
day
there
are
medicinal
springs
here
that
possess
wonderful
curative
properties
or
people
think
they
do
we
wanted
sim
to
test
them
but
he
said
am
getting
well
as
fast
as
possible
and
i
care
to
drink
that
nauseous
water
i
prefer
the
pure
unadulterated
snow
water
from
the
mountain
this
is
the
junction
of
the
oregon
and
montana
roads
there
are
three
camps
within
sight
of
us
wednesday
august
as
we
drove
into
the
road
this
morning
there
was
a
train
of
eight
wagons
came
into
line
just
behind
our
wagons
and
have
traveled
with
us
all
day
stopping
at
noon
when
we
did
and
they
are
camping
near
us
though
we
have
separate
camps
they
are
from
missouri
and
are
going
to
virginia
city
they
seem
to
think
as
we
all
came
from
the
same
state
and
our
destination
is
the
same
place
that
of
course
there
is
a
bond
of
fellowship
that
is
mutual
but
to
be
frank
i
must
confess
i
do
not
care
to
go
into
a
strange
place
in
their
company
for
i
fear
we
would
be
judged
by
the
company
we
keep
and
i
think
it
would
not
be
very
favorable
so
we
will
try
to
get
away
from
them
as
soon
as
possible
the
weather
is
perfect
this
is
a
beautiful
valley
the
men
say
the
land
is
extremely
rich
we
are
camping
on
the
blackfoot
we
have
not
been
able
to
shake
our
missouri
friends
we
meet
men
returning
to
the
states
thursday
august
we
came
to
a
toll
bridge
over
the
blackfoot
this
morning
where
the
toll
was
one
dollar
per
team
and
fifty
cents
for
horseback
riders
there
had
been
an
excellent
ford
just
below
the
bridge
the
men
collecting
the
toll
had
spoiled
it
by
digging
ditches
on
both
sides
near
the
bank
the
water
was
clear
and
they
were
plainly
visible
hillhouse
mounted
dick
to
see
if
we
could
ford
it
one
of
the
men
screamed
out
at
him
will
mire
your
horse
if
you
try
risk
and
he
rode
in
below
where
the
ditches
were
dug
the
feet
were
not
muddy
hillhouse
found
we
could
easily
ford
the
creek
below
the
ditches
which
we
did
without
accident
it
does
seem
a
shame
that
we
should
have
to
pay
toll
for
crossing
a
stream
like
that
after
fording
south
platte
north
platte
and
green
river
the
missourians
refused
to
pay
the
exorbitant
price
and
offered
them
fifty
cents
per
wagon
they
swore
they
would
not
take
a
cent
less
than
one
dollar
but
the
travelers
were
too
many
for
them
and
they
drove
over
and
did
not
pay
a
cent
the
toll
men
were
fearfully
angry
and
made
great
threats
but
the
men
dared
them
to
do
their
worst
and
laughed
at
them
i
do
hope
we
will
get
ahead
of
these
people
they
are
not
the
kind
of
people
i
like
to
travel
with
we
have
met
as
many
as
twenty
men
going
back
to
the
states
from
the
virginia
city
mines
george
mays
was
with
them
i
mentioned
about
his
leaving
the
train
to
go
through
on
horseback
expecting
to
get
his
meals
at
stations
and
emigrant
trains
when
his
brother
with
his
bride
went
to
colorado
says
he
worked
just
one
day
and
got
five
dollars
for
it
and
took
the
back
track
the
next
day
is
the
only
work
a
man
can
get
to
do
and
it
would
kill
an
ordinary
man
in
less
than
a
he
is
distressingly
homesick
he
is
going
to
denver
to
his
brother
friday
august
we
were
up
at
the
first
peep
of
dawn
had
breakfast
and
were
hitching
up
to
start
when
the
folks
in
the
eight
wagons
began
to
emerge
and
light
their
camp
fires
so
we
have
left
them
some
distance
behind
we
have
been
meeting
men
all
day
returning
from
the
mines
they
give
a
doleful
account
of
the
hard
times
in
montana
they
say
are
a
few
fortunate
ones
who
are
making
money
like
dirt
but
they
are
the
exception
about
one
in
a
one
man
was
very
anxious
to
buy
dick
i
told
him
pony
is
not
for
sale
and
rode
away
before
he
could
say
anything
more
the
boys
say
we
have
met
as
many
as
two
hundred
men
returning
from
the
mines
i
believe
we
are
all
somewhat
discouraged
this
evening
we
have
always
heard
such
flattering
reports
from
alder
gulch
and
virginia
city
friday
august
we
have
overtaken
grier
bower
and
kennedy
some
of
cattle
have
eaten
a
poisonous
herb
wild
larkspur
i
believe
it
is
one
ox
has
died
and
several
are
poisoned
but
will
not
die
they
got
the
poison
weed
the
day
before
yesterday
when
they
stopped
at
noon
i
am
glad
we
have
overtaken
them
but
sorry
for
their
misfortune
hillhouse
has
just
now
come
in
and
says
joe
one
of
our
big
white
oxen
is
poisoned
he
came
for
remedies
and
to
sharpen
his
knife
to
bleed
him
no
doubt
he
got
the
poison
the
same
place
cattle
did
when
we
stopped
for
noon
sim
hillhouse
and
winthrop
have
gone
to
his
relief
mother
and
i
save
life
the
boys
came
back
very
much
discouraged
after
working
an
hour
and
said
blood
will
not
flow
and
he
is
swelling
frightfully
i
fear
he
will
die
for
when
the
blood
will
not
run
and
the
animal
begins
to
swell
they
can
not
be
mother
said
will
not
let
him
die
without
further
effort
at
least
come
on
sarah
let
us
try
what
we
can
do
for
we
melted
a
quart
of
lard
and
put
it
in
a
bottle
that
we
had
brought
for
the
purpose
of
drenching
horses
or
cattle
cut
up
a
lot
of
fat
bacon
into
strips
put
on
our
big
aprons
and
taking
a
bucket
of
cold
water
we
were
ready
hillhouse
said
give
him
i
answered
never
mind
who
is
doing
this
we
were
not
long
finding
poor
joe
he
seemed
to
be
suffering
dreadfully
his
nose
was
as
hot
as
fire
it
actually
burned
my
hands
when
i
took
hold
of
it
to
drench
him
with
the
lard
he
seemed
to
know
we
were
trying
to
help
him
and
did
not
resist
at
all
when
i
put
the
bottle
in
the
side
of
his
mouth
to
pour
the
lard
down
his
throat
he
looked
at
us
with
his
great
soft
patient
eyes
in
such
a
docile
knowing
manner
i
felt
sure
he
would
not
bite
me
so
i
put
my
hand
away
down
his
throat
to
make
him
swallow
the
strips
of
fat
bacon
he
swallowed
them
as
patiently
as
if
he
knew
what
they
were
for
we
then
bathed
his
nose
with
the
cold
water
without
letting
him
drink
any
and
before
we
came
away
he
seemed
relieved
and
the
swelling
had
stopped
and
he
breathed
much
better
i
believe
he
will
live
saturday
august
joe
did
not
die
this
morning
when
hillhouse
went
to
see
about
him
expecting
to
find
him
dead
he
was
grazing
and
seemed
as
well
as
ever
except
his
nose
which
looks
as
if
it
had
been
scalded
we
came
to
snake
river
ferry
this
morning
six
miles
from
where
we
camped
last
night
we
paid
eight
dollars
for
our
outfit
crossing
on
the
ferry
as
nellie
bower
and
i
were
standing
on
the
bank
of
the
river
watching
the
wagons
being
ferried
over
holding
our
ponies
by
their
bridles
a
gentleman
came
near
lifting
his
hat
and
bowing
politely
he
said
to
me
will
give
one
hundred
dollars
in
clean
gold
dust
for
that
pony
is
not
for
sale
sir
at
any
we
came
from
the
ferry
about
two
miles
and
stopped
for
lunch
i
told
hillhouse
what
the
man
said
i
were
you
i
would
certainly
sell
him
so
many
seem
to
want
him
he
will
very
likely
be
i
sell
my
after
lunch
the
men
folks
went
to
fish
in
snake
river
they
had
been
gone
but
a
few
minutes
when
the
man
that
wanted
dick
rode
into
camp
he
rode
straight
to
our
wagons
and
said
will
give
you
one
hundred
and
ten
dollars
for
that
i
had
begun
to
relent
somewhat
i
felt
that
it
would
not
do
to
be
sentimental
under
existing
circumstances
we
had
spent
almost
all
our
money
for
toll
ferrying
and
other
expenses
on
the
road
it
might
prove
to
be
a
serious
matter
to
be
in
a
strange
place
without
money
and
if
we
fail
to
get
employment
we
will
be
obliged
to
sell
something
and
there
is
nothing
we
can
spare
so
well
as
dick
i
knew
the
man
had
offered
all
and
more
than
i
could
expect
to
get
for
him
but
as
hillhouse
was
gone
fishing
and
i
could
not
think
of
selling
my
pony
myself
i
said
to
the
man
brother
is
not
here
and
i
can
not
let
him
your
brother
to
bring
him
to
the
ferry
and
i
will
send
you
the
pay
for
think
you
need
not
expect
him
for
i
am
sure
he
will
not
he
went
away
without
dick
and
hillhouse
did
not
take
him
back
so
i
have
my
pony
yet
we
came
five
miles
and
camped
as
too
long
a
drive
is
not
good
for
the
poisoned
cattle
i
wish
there
was
a
longer
distance
between
us
and
the
man
that
wants
my
pony
grier
sold
his
riding
horse
at
the
ferry
he
says
is
a
party
of
half
a
dozen
gentlemen
going
to
the
states
horseback
they
are
all
supplied
except
the
man
that
wants
your
pony
he
has
waited
trying
to
find
a
horse
with
an
easy
gait
and
dick
is
the
only
one
that
has
suited
him
oh
he
will
be
back
again
miss
raymond
and
make
another
offer
and
if
you
do
not
let
him
have
him
i
know
what
he
will
do
for
he
seems
determined
to
get
if
he
does
come
i
will
not
dare
to
refuse
him
but
i
do
hope
we
are
out
of
reach
of
temptation
dick
is
as
fat
as
when
we
started
i
comb
and
brush
him
every
day
and
he
shows
his
keeping
he
always
looks
nice
and
sleek
he
is
a
bright
bay
with
heavy
black
mane
and
tail
dick
is
sold
oh
dear
sunday
august
it
was
scarcely
daylight
when
that
hateful
man
was
here
again
after
dick
i
had
just
finished
dressing
when
hillhouse
came
to
the
wagon
and
said
i
let
dick
go
as
you
think
and
i
threw
myself
on
the
bed
for
a
good
cry
i
had
not
stopped
crying
when
he
came
back
and
throwing
a
buckskin
purse
into
my
lap
said
is
your
there
was
one
hundred
and
dollars
in
gold
dust
in
it
i
sobbed
out
loud
hillhouse
looked
at
me
with
contempt
in
his
expression
but
said
nothing
i
could
not
help
crying
i
know
he
would
never
sell
anything
that
he
loved
and
i
love
that
pony
i
let
the
purse
roll
out
of
my
lap
down
into
the
bottom
of
the
wagon
and
have
not
touched
it
yet
of
course
i
knew
the
was
tight
and
there
is
no
danger
of
its
being
lost
we
came
to
silver
lake
we
are
having
a
fine
shower
of
rain
which
we
were
needing
very
much
it
was
some
time
coming
so
we
had
dinner
over
and
were
ready
for
it
when
it
reached
us
monday
august
we
have
traveled
over
snake
river
desert
nothing
but
sand
and
we
watered
at
noon
at
a
toll
well
called
and
paid
ten
cents
a
head
for
watering
stock
i
wonder
what
we
will
have
to
pay
toll
for
next
we
are
camping
on
creek
there
is
a
family
camping
near
us
from
bannack
going
to
the
states
the
lady
is
a
sister
of
esler
one
of
the
quartz
kings
of
montana
so
she
says
i
presume
everybody
knows
about
him
but
i
must
confess
i
never
heard
of
him
until
now
his
sister
is
taking
his
motherless
babe
back
to
its
grandmother
wife
died
more
than
a
month
ago
the
babe
is
about
four
months
old
and
as
sweet
as
can
be
i
could
not
keep
my
hands
off
it
and
that
is
how
i
came
to
get
acquainted
with
its
auntie
she
is
a
great
talker
seems
to
think
i
am
going
to
montana
and
volunteered
a
deal
of
advice
on
the
subject
especially
i
must
not
tell
that
i
am
from
missouri
as
missourians
are
below
par
in
montana
she
is
from
new
york
oh
dear
it
makes
one
tired
to
see
a
woman
so
frivolous
tuesday
august
we
watered
the
stock
at
noon
at
turn
them
out
to
graze
as
there
was
nothing
for
them
to
graze
on
bower
has
lost
another
ox
and
was
obliged
to
buy
a
yoke
of
oxen
to
get
his
wagons
over
the
ranges
there
are
two
mountains
to
cross
before
he
reaches
his
home
in
the
madison
valley
fifteen
or
twenty
miles
the
other
side
of
virginia
city
of
course
he
had
to
pay
a
most
exorbitant
price
joe
our
ox
that
was
poisoned
seems
as
well
as
ever
except
his
nose
has
peeled
off
as
if
scalded
into
a
blister
we
are
camping
at
the
foot
of
the
last
range
we
will
cross
before
we
reach
our
destination
kennedy
and
i
have
become
quite
well
acquainted
the
last
few
days
she
was
a
bride
of
only
a
few
days
when
they
started
to
the
west
her
husband
drives
one
of
teams
they
are
going
among
strangers
to
make
them
a
home
and
fortune
she
is
a
very
intelligent
and
young
woman
i
do
not
know
her
husband
very
much
birthday
wednesday
august
birthday
she
is
years
old
we
have
not
been
able
to
celebrate
it
especially
yet
she
is
not
likely
to
forget
it
though
spent
in
climbing
a
rocky
mountain
range
we
have
been
now
four
months
on
this
journey
have
lived
out
of
doors
in
all
sorts
of
weather
it
has
been
very
beneficial
to
mother
she
was
looking
frail
and
delicate
when
we
started
but
seems
to
be
in
perfect
health
now
and
looks
at
least
ten
years
younger
i
have
not
heard
her
utter
one
word
of
complaint
either
of
physical
suffering
or
outward
discomfort
such
as
the
heat
or
cold
mud
dust
rain
nor
any
of
the
things
that
make
camping
out
disagreeable
and
so
many
people
grumble
about
be
cured
must
be
endured
is
her
motto
and
the
one
care
has
been
that
we
all
keep
in
good
health
and
she
would
ask
nothing
more
we
are
camping
in
pleasant
valley
a
depression
right
on
top
of
the
mountain
just
large
enough
for
a
ranch
it
is
a
beautiful
place
the
scenery
is
magnificently
grand
there
is
a
fine
grove
of
beautiful
trees
at
the
lower
end
of
the
vale
the
sides
and
upper
end
are
hedged
in
by
straight
up
and
down
hills
or
about
fifteen
feet
high
the
grass
is
a
luxuriant
green
and
very
plentiful
there
is
a
station
here
occupied
by
a
family
that
used
to
live
in
virginia
city
they
have
two
very
bright
little
girls
who
have
spent
the
early
evening
hours
with
us
they
are
perfect
little
chatterboxes
to
talk
they
have
a
married
sister
living
in
virginia
city
the
wife
of
a
wheeler
who
is
a
candidate
for
some
office
the
little
girls
had
forgotten
whether
for
sheriff
or
member
of
congress
thursday
september
this
is
brother
birthday
he
is
years
old
i
wonder
if
he
has
thought
of
it
and
remembered
us
i
presume
he
has
it
has
been
some
weeks
since
we
have
had
an
opportunity
to
post
a
letter
to
him
there
have
been
depredations
by
the
indians
which
have
no
doubt
been
largely
reported
in
the
newspapers
and
he
can
not
know
that
we
have
escaped
his
anxiety
and
suspense
must
be
hard
to
bear
i
know
i
should
suffer
agonies
were
our
circumstances
reversed
as
we
were
descending
the
mountain
we
met
a
freight
train
loaded
with
people
returning
to
the
states
after
we
had
passed
them
about
half
a
mile
hillhouse
was
walking
in
front
of
the
wagons
and
found
a
shovel
it
is
bright
and
shining
but
not
new
it
is
worn
off
some
the
men
tell
hillhouse
it
is
a
good
omen
that
he
will
make
money
by
the
shovelful
he
laughed
and
said
reckon
better
keep
it
then
to
shovel
it
up
friday
september
when
i
awoke
in
the
night
i
heard
the
rain
pattering
on
the
this
morning
the
mountains
were
all
covered
with
snow
and
presented
a
magnificent
picture
those
nearest
our
camp
are
covered
with
pine
trees
of
an
intensely
dark
green
the
snow
on
the
boughs
and
beneath
the
trees
glittered
in
the
sunshine
the
scene
was
constantly
changing
as
the
warm
sun
melted
the
snow
from
the
boughs
and
before
night
it
was
all
gone
except
on
the
highest
peaks
where
it
stays
all
summer
the
roads
have
been
sloppy
and
muddy
though
the
water
has
all
run
off
or
evaporated
so
that
it
is
comparatively
dry
where
we
are
camping
notwithstanding
there
was
so
much
snow
and
water
on
the
ground
this
morning
it
is
too
cold
for
comfort
this
evening
we
are
hovering
around
the
stove
with
our
shawls
on
sweet
water
cañon
saturday
september
we
came
through
a
deep
dark
cañon
this
morning
and
passed
the
grave
of
a
man
that
was
robbed
and
murdered
last
week
it
is
the
deepest
and
darkest
cañon
we
have
traveled
through
ten
men
have
been
robbed
and
murdered
in
it
in
the
last
two
years
we
were
in
no
danger
of
being
molested
only
men
who
have
their
fortunes
in
gold
about
their
person
are
intercepted
robbed
and
killed
how
awful
it
seems
why
will
men
be
so
wicked
in
several
places
in
the
cañon
the
road
has
been
widened
with
pick
and
shovel
perhaps
two
or
three
work
done
and
we
had
to
pay
ten
dollars
toll
for
our
two
wagons
passing
over
it
we
stopped
at
noon
on
black
tail
deer
creek
are
camping
on
the
sweet
water
about
miles
from
virginia
city
this
is
a
beautiful
place
there
are
fine
large
trees
along
the
creek
high
mountains
around
a
lovely
dale
it
is
just
large
enough
for
a
fine
farm
there
is
a
deserted
cabin
here
where
some
one
commenced
improving
a
farm
became
homesick
and
discouraged
and
left
it
for
some
one
else
sunday
september
we
are
camping
within
seven
miles
of
virginia
city
near
a
freight
train
of
about
fifty
wagons
with
from
to
one
hundred
people
all
together
men
women
and
children
returning
to
the
states
to
hear
these
people
talk
of
the
disadvantages
and
disagreeable
things
with
regard
to
life
in
montana
would
have
a
tendency
to
discourage
one
if
it
were
not
so
palpable
that
they
are
homesick
and
everyone
knows
that
when
that
disease
is
fairly
developed
everything
is
colored
with
a
deep
dark
blue
and
even
pleasant
things
seem
extremely
disagreeable
to
the
afflicted
person
the
ladies
seem
to
have
the
disease
in
its
worst
form
and
of
course
they
make
the
gentlemen
do
as
they
wish
which
is
to
take
them
home
to
mother
and
other
dear
ones
we
have
had
a
very
pleasant
day
about
as
pleasant
as
the
day
we
started
on
this
journey
the
first
day
of
may
it
is
cheering
that
the
first
and
last
days
of
our
journeying
should
be
so
lovely
after
four
months
and
four
days
of
living
outdoors
we
are
all
in
the
most
robust
health
yet
we
shall
be
glad
to
have
a
roof
over
our
heads
once
more
even
if
it
is
a
dirt
roof
monday
september
here
we
are
camping
in
the
suburbs
of
the
city
in
alder
gulch
where
the
miners
are
at
work
how
i
wish
my
descriptive
powers
were
adequate
to
making
those
who
have
never
seen
see
as
i
see
and
realize
the
impression
made
upon
me
as
i
first
looked
into
the
gulch
at
the
miners
at
work
there
is
a
temporary
bridge
very
shaky
across
the
gulch
that
wagons
may
pass
over
standing
on
this
bridge
in
the
middle
of
the
gulch
looking
up
and
down
and
even
beneath
my
feet
the
scene
is
a
lively
one
so
many
men
it
seems
they
would
be
in
each
way
they
remind
one
of
bees
around
a
hive
and
such
active
work
it
seemed
that
not
one
of
that
great
multitude
stopped
for
one
instant
shoveling
and
wheeling
dirt
passing
and
repassing
each
other
without
a
hitch
it
made
me
tired
to
look
at
them
the
ground
is
literally
turned
inside
out
great
deep
holes
and
high
heaps
of
dirt
the
mines
are
said
to
be
very
rich
we
dined
at
noon
had
beefsteak
at
fifty
cents
per
pound
and
potatoes
at
cents
i
do
not
know
if
the
price
had
anything
to
do
with
it
but
it
certainly
tasted
better
than
any
i
ever
ate
before
i
interviewed
a
woman
or
rather
she
interviewed
me
that
lives
near
where
we
are
camping
she
said
her
name
is
neihart
her
husband
is
a
miner
and
earns
seven
dollars
per
day
judging
from
the
manner
in
which
they
seem
to
live
they
ought
to
save
at
least
five
of
it
i
presume
i
did
not
make
a
very
favorable
impression
for
after
i
came
back
to
camp
she
called
across
the
street
to
her
neighbor
so
we
could
hear
what
she
said
more
aristocrats
they
come
here
to
work
going
to
teach
school
and
play
lady
with
great
contempt
in
her
voice
i
laughed
at
the
first
impression
made
and
tried
to
realize
that
teaching
is
not
work
the
end
of
our
journey
curry
sim
hillhouse
and
i
are
going
to
town
as
soon
as
curry
is
ready
we
held
a
council
whether
we
should
get
out
our
street
suits
and
last
hats
or
go
in
our
emigrant
outfits
and
short
dresses
thick
shoes
and
all
decided
in
favor
of
the
latter
no
doubt
the
people
of
virginia
are
used
to
seeing
emigrants
in
emigrant
outfits
and
we
will
not
astonish
them
we
were
not
very
favorably
impressed
with
virginia
city
it
is
the
shabbiest
town
i
ever
saw
not
a
really
good
house
in
it
hillhouse
and
i
after
hunting
up
and
down
the
two
most
respectable
looking
streets
found
a
log
cabin
with
two
rooms
that
we
rented
for
eight
dollars
per
month
curry
did
not
find
a
house
at
all
we
thought
as
so
many
were
leaving
there
would
be
an
abundance
of
vacant
houses
but
there
were
enough
living
in
tents
to
fill
all
the
houses
that
were
vacated
folks
and
will
go
to
helena
bower
has
a
ranch
on
the
madison
valley
grier
will
stay
here
for
a
time
anyway
the
cabin
is
on
the
corner
of
wallace
and
hamilton
streets
next
door
to
the
city
butcher
the
cabin
has
a
dirt
roof
there
is
a
floor
in
it
and
that
is
better
than
some
have
it
is
neat
and
clean
which
is
a
comfort
men
have
not
bached
in
it
we
found
quite
a
budget
of
letters
at
the
the
most
important
of
which
are
from
brother
mac
and
frank
kerfoot
letter
cincinnati
august
mother
sister
and
it
is
with
fear
and
trembling
that
i
pen
this
letter
i
have
not
heard
from
you
for
more
than
a
month
telling
me
you
had
decided
to
go
to
montana
the
papers
are
full
of
accounts
of
indian
depredations
i
have
realized
to
the
fullest
extent
that
deferred
maketh
the
heart
in
your
last
letter
you
had
decided
to
go
to
virginia
city
so
i
will
direct
this
letter
to
be
held
until
called
for
i
am
glad
you
are
not
going
any
farther
west
i
can
not
conceive
why
you
wanted
to
go
to
that
far
off
wild
western
country
i
do
wish
you
had
stopped
at
omaha
or
jo
or
even
denver
it
would
have
been
better
than
montana
with
sincerest
love
to
all
your
son
and
brother
mac
but
oh
the
sad
sad
news
comes
in
letter
neelie
is
dead
oh
the
anguish
of
soul
the
desolateness
of
heart
that
one
sentence
gives
expression
to
letter
green
river
wyoming
miss
i
write
to
tell
you
of
our
very
great
sorrow
precious
neelie
is
gone
we
are
all
sorely
bereaved
but
how
uncle
family
can
ever
get
along
without
her
i
can
not
see
any
member
of
the
family
except
uncle
could
be
spared
better
than
neelie
she
got
very
much
better
and
the
doctor
said
if
uncle
would
stay
there
another
week
he
was
sure
neelie
would
be
well
enough
to
travel
without
danger
of
a
relapse
but
if
she
had
another
relapse
she
could
not
be
saved
the
hardinbrooke
train
left
monday
morning
hardinbrooke
was
much
better
the
gatewoods
and
ryans
stayed
with
us
neelie
was
much
better
she
sat
up
in
bed
some
that
night
uncle
ezra
did
not
sleep
at
all
he
was
so
afraid
of
indians
the
next
morning
as
neelie
had
a
good
rest
and
was
feeling
stronger
nothing
else
would
do
but
we
must
move
on
to
green
river
where
the
soldiers
are
we
started
about
nine
and
drove
miles
without
stopping
it
was
very
hot
and
dusty
uncle
drove
the
family
wagon
and
watched
neelie
carefully
after
a
time
she
seemed
to
be
sleeping
quietly
so
he
thought
she
was
all
right
but
it
was
the
sleep
from
which
there
is
no
waking
in
this
life
howard
and
fletcher
were
both
at
green
river
and
they
both
worked
all
night
trying
to
arouse
her
but
without
success
at
early
dawn
sweet
spirit
took
its
flight
and
we
are
left
desolate
miss
sallie
do
you
remember
carpenter
the
young
man
that
made
uncle
ezra
so
mad
by
pretending
to
go
into
hysterics
when
the
ryan
girls
were
leaving
the
train
when
he
heard
that
neelie
was
gone
he
went
out
on
the
mountain
and
found
a
large
smooth
flat
stone
white
as
marble
but
not
so
hard
and
engraved
name
age
and
date
of
her
death
on
it
to
mark
her
resting
place
he
worked
all
day
upon
it
and
at
the
funeral
he
placed
it
at
the
head
of
her
grave
and
if
you
ever
go
over
this
road
it
will
not
be
hard
to
find
grave
we
gathered
wild
flowers
and
literally
covered
her
grave
with
them
darling
neelie
our
loss
is
her
gain
for
we
all
know
that
she
was
an
earnest
devoted
christian
we
will
start
on
our
now
sorrowful
journey
i
wish
you
were
here
to
go
with
us
but
hope
you
will
be
successful
where
you
are
and
happy
too
hardinbrooke
was
much
worse
after
they
came
here
that
hot
dusty
drive
was
hard
on
well
people
for
sick
people
it
was
terrible
when
neelie
died
she
was
very
low
but
she
has
rallied
and
the
rest
of
the
train
will
move
on
but
hardinbrooke
will
stay
here
with
his
wife
until
she
is
entirely
restored
and
they
will
go
to
virginia
city
on
the
coach
all
send
love
to
you
all
aunt
mildred
asked
me
to
write
you
very
sincerely
your
friend
frank
i
believe
i
am
homesick
this
evening
it
is
so
dreary
to
go
into
a
strange
place
and
meet
so
many
people
and
not
one
familiar
face
but
i
must
not
complain
for
we
are
all
here
not
even
cæsar
missing
my
heart
aches
so
for
the
kerfoots
i
do
not
know
how
they
can
bear
this
terrible
bereavement
under
such
trying
circumstances
tuesday
september
folks
have
started
to
helena
to
the
madison
valley
and
kennedy
with
them
to
drive
his
team
leaving
kennedy
with
us
until
when
they
will
take
the
coach
for
helena
we
moved
into
our
cabin
this
morning
it
does
not
seem
as
much
like
home
as
the
wagons
did
and
i
believe
we
are
all
homesick
if
we
would
acknowledge
it
the
boys
found
a
checkerboard
nailed
on
the
window
where
a
pane
of
glass
was
broken
out
we
pasted
paper
over
the
place
they
made
checkermen
out
of
pasteboard
and
sim
and
winthrop
are
having
a
game
hillhouse
is
reading
the
montana
post
mother
is
making
bread
and
initiating
kennedy
into
the
mysteries
of
yeast
and
as
hillhouse
was
on
his
way
to
the
butcher
shop
he
passed
an
auction
sale
of
household
goods
the
auctioneer
was
crying
a
beautiful
porcelain
lamp
he
stopped
to
make
the
first
bid
he
called
there
were
no
other
bids
and
he
got
the
lamp
his
first
purchase
in
virginia
city
he
has
it
yet
when
he
brought
it
home
with
the
meat
he
went
to
get
mother
said
is
the
use
of
the
lamp
without
the
chimney
so
he
went
to
purchase
a
chimney
after
dinner
and
coal
oil
to
burn
in
the
lamp
he
had
to
pay
two
dollars
and
fifty
cents
for
a
chimney
and
five
dollars
for
a
gallon
of
coal
oil
so
our
light
is
rather
expensive
after
all
and
thus
ends
our
first
day
in
virginia
city
and
brings
the
plains
and
mountains
in
to
an
end
