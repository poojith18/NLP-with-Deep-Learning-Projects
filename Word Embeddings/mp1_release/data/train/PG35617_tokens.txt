the
coming
of
the
terror
after
two
years
we
are
turning
once
more
to
the
news
with
a
sense
of
appetite
and
glad
expectation
there
were
thrills
at
the
beginning
of
the
war
the
thrill
of
horror
and
of
a
doom
that
seemed
at
once
incredible
and
certain
this
was
when
namur
fell
and
the
german
host
swelled
like
a
flood
over
the
french
fields
and
drew
very
near
to
the
walls
of
paris
then
we
felt
the
thrill
of
exultation
when
the
good
news
came
that
the
awful
tide
had
been
turned
back
that
paris
and
the
world
were
safe
for
awhile
at
all
events
then
for
days
we
hoped
for
more
news
as
good
as
this
or
better
has
von
kluck
been
surrounded
not
but
perhaps
he
will
be
surrounded
but
the
days
became
weeks
the
weeks
drew
out
to
months
the
battle
in
the
west
seemed
frozen
now
and
again
things
were
done
that
seemed
hopeful
with
promise
of
events
still
better
but
neuve
chapelle
and
loos
dwindled
into
disappointments
as
their
tale
was
told
fully
the
lines
in
the
west
remained
for
all
practical
purposes
of
victory
immobile
nothing
seemed
to
happen
there
was
nothing
to
read
save
the
record
of
operations
that
were
clearly
trifling
and
insignificant
people
speculated
as
to
the
reason
of
this
inaction
the
hopeful
said
that
joffre
had
a
plan
that
he
was
others
declared
that
we
were
short
of
munitions
others
again
that
the
new
levies
were
not
yet
ripe
for
battle
so
the
months
went
by
and
almost
two
years
of
war
had
been
completed
before
the
motionless
english
line
began
to
stir
and
quiver
as
if
it
awoke
from
a
long
sleep
and
began
to
roll
onward
overwhelming
the
enemy
the
secret
of
the
long
inaction
of
the
british
armies
has
been
well
kept
on
the
one
hand
it
was
rigorously
protected
by
the
censorship
which
severe
and
sometimes
severe
to
the
point
of
captains
and
the
depart
for
in
this
particular
matter
ferocious
as
soon
as
the
real
significance
of
that
which
was
happening
or
beginning
to
happen
was
perceived
by
the
authorities
an
underlined
circular
was
issued
to
the
newspaper
proprietors
of
great
britain
and
ireland
it
warned
each
proprietor
that
he
might
impart
the
contents
of
this
circular
to
one
other
person
only
such
person
being
the
responsible
editor
of
his
paper
who
was
to
keep
the
communication
secret
under
the
severest
penalties
the
circular
forbade
any
mention
of
certain
events
that
had
taken
place
that
might
take
place
it
forbade
any
kind
of
allusion
to
these
events
or
any
hint
of
their
existence
or
of
the
possibility
of
their
existence
not
only
in
the
press
but
in
any
form
whatever
the
subject
was
not
to
be
alluded
to
in
conversation
it
was
not
to
be
hinted
at
however
obscurely
in
letters
the
very
existence
of
the
circular
its
subject
apart
was
to
be
a
dead
secret
these
measures
were
successful
a
wealthy
newspaper
proprietor
of
the
north
warmed
a
little
at
the
end
of
the
feast
which
was
held
as
usual
it
will
be
remembered
ventured
to
say
to
the
man
next
to
him
awful
it
would
be
it
if
his
words
were
repeated
as
proof
one
regrets
to
say
that
it
was
time
for
to
himself
and
he
was
fined
a
thousand
pounds
then
there
was
the
case
of
an
obscure
weekly
paper
published
in
the
county
town
of
an
agricultural
district
in
wales
the
we
will
call
it
was
issued
from
a
back
premises
and
filled
its
four
pages
with
accounts
of
local
flower
shows
fancy
fairs
at
vicarages
reports
of
parish
councils
and
rare
bathing
fatalities
it
also
issued
a
list
which
has
been
known
to
contain
six
names
this
enlightened
organ
printed
a
paragraph
which
nobody
noticed
which
was
very
like
paragraphs
that
small
country
newspapers
have
long
been
in
the
habit
of
printing
which
could
hardly
give
so
much
as
a
hint
to
any
any
one
that
is
who
was
not
fully
instructed
in
the
secret
as
a
matter
of
fact
this
piece
of
intelligence
got
into
the
paper
because
the
proprietor
who
was
also
the
editor
incautiously
left
the
last
processes
of
this
particular
issue
to
the
staff
who
was
the
of
the
establishment
and
the
staff
put
in
a
bit
of
gossip
he
had
heard
in
the
market
to
fill
up
two
inches
on
the
back
page
but
the
result
was
that
the
ceased
to
appear
owing
to
as
the
proprietor
said
and
he
would
say
no
more
no
more
that
is
by
way
of
explanation
but
a
great
deal
more
by
way
of
execration
of
prying
now
a
censorship
that
is
sufficiently
minute
and
utterly
remorseless
can
do
amazing
things
in
the
way
of
hiding
what
it
wants
to
hide
before
the
war
one
would
have
thought
otherwise
one
would
have
said
that
censor
or
no
censor
the
fact
of
the
murder
at
x
or
the
fact
of
the
bank
robbery
at
y
would
certainly
become
known
if
not
through
the
press
at
all
events
through
rumor
and
the
passage
of
the
news
from
mouth
to
mouth
and
this
would
be
england
three
hundred
years
ago
and
of
savage
tribelands
of
but
we
have
grown
of
late
to
such
a
reverence
for
the
printed
word
and
such
a
reliance
on
it
that
the
old
faculty
of
disseminating
news
by
word
of
mouth
has
become
atrophied
forbid
the
press
to
mention
the
fact
that
jones
has
been
murdered
and
it
is
marvelous
how
few
people
will
hear
of
it
and
of
those
who
hear
how
few
will
credit
the
story
that
they
have
heard
you
meet
a
man
in
the
train
who
remarks
that
he
has
been
told
something
about
a
murder
in
southwark
there
is
all
the
difference
in
the
world
between
the
impression
you
receive
from
such
a
chance
communication
and
that
given
by
half
a
dozen
lines
of
print
with
name
and
street
and
date
and
all
the
facts
of
the
case
people
in
trains
repeat
all
sorts
of
tales
many
of
them
false
newspapers
do
not
print
accounts
of
murders
that
have
not
been
committed
then
another
consideration
that
has
made
for
secrecy
i
may
have
seemed
to
say
that
the
old
office
of
rumor
no
longer
exists
i
shall
be
reminded
of
the
strange
legend
of
and
the
mythology
of
the
of
but
let
me
point
out
in
the
first
place
that
both
these
absurdities
depended
on
the
papers
for
their
wide
dissemination
if
there
had
been
no
newspapers
or
magazines
russians
and
angels
would
have
made
but
a
brief
vague
appearance
of
the
most
shadowy
few
would
have
heard
of
them
fewer
still
would
have
believed
in
them
they
would
have
been
gossiped
about
for
a
bare
week
or
two
and
so
they
would
have
vanished
away
and
then
again
the
very
fact
of
these
vain
rumors
and
fantastic
tales
having
been
so
widely
believed
for
a
time
was
fatal
to
the
credit
of
any
stray
mutterings
that
may
have
got
abroad
people
had
been
taken
in
twice
they
had
seen
how
grave
persons
men
of
credit
had
preached
and
lectured
about
the
shining
forms
that
had
saved
the
british
army
at
mons
or
had
testified
to
the
trains
packed
with
muscovites
rushing
through
the
land
at
dead
of
night
and
now
there
was
a
hint
of
something
more
amazing
than
either
of
the
discredited
legends
but
this
time
there
was
no
word
of
confirmation
to
be
found
in
daily
paper
or
weekly
review
or
parish
magazine
and
so
the
few
that
heard
either
laughed
or
being
serious
went
home
and
jotted
down
notes
for
essays
on
psychology
collective
i
followed
neither
of
these
courses
for
before
the
secret
circular
had
been
issued
my
curiosity
had
somehow
been
aroused
by
certain
paragraphs
concerning
a
accident
to
the
propeller
of
the
airplane
had
been
shattered
apparently
by
a
collision
with
a
flight
of
pigeons
the
blades
had
been
broken
and
the
machine
had
fallen
like
lead
to
the
earth
and
soon
after
i
had
seen
this
account
i
heard
of
some
very
odd
circumstances
relating
to
an
explosion
in
a
great
munition
factory
in
the
midlands
i
thought
i
saw
the
possibility
of
a
connection
between
two
very
different
events
it
has
been
pointed
out
to
me
by
friends
who
have
been
good
enough
to
read
this
record
that
certain
phrases
i
have
used
may
give
the
impression
that
i
ascribe
all
the
delays
of
the
war
on
the
western
front
to
the
extraordinary
circumstances
which
occasioned
the
issue
of
the
secret
circular
of
course
this
is
not
the
case
there
were
many
reasons
for
the
immobility
of
our
lines
from
october
to
july
these
causes
have
been
evident
enough
and
have
been
openly
discussed
and
deplored
but
behind
them
was
something
of
infinitely
greater
moment
we
lacked
men
but
men
were
pouring
into
the
new
army
we
were
short
of
shells
but
when
the
shortage
was
proclaimed
the
nation
set
itself
to
mend
this
matter
with
all
its
energy
we
could
undertake
to
supply
the
defects
of
our
army
both
in
men
and
the
new
and
incredible
danger
could
be
overcome
it
has
been
overcome
rather
perhaps
it
has
ceased
to
exist
and
the
secret
may
now
be
told
i
have
said
my
attention
was
attracted
by
an
account
of
the
death
of
a
airman
i
have
not
the
habit
of
preserving
cuttings
i
am
sorry
to
say
so
that
i
can
not
be
precise
as
to
the
date
of
this
event
to
the
best
of
my
belief
it
was
either
towards
the
end
of
may
or
the
beginning
of
june
the
newspaper
paragraph
announcing
the
death
of
was
brief
enough
accidents
and
fatal
accidents
to
the
men
who
are
storming
the
air
for
us
are
unfortunately
by
no
means
so
rare
as
to
demand
an
elaborated
notice
but
the
manner
in
which
met
his
death
struck
me
as
extraordinary
inasmuch
as
it
revealed
a
new
danger
in
the
element
that
we
have
lately
conquered
he
was
brought
down
as
i
said
by
a
flight
of
birds
of
pigeons
as
appeared
by
what
was
found
on
the
bloodstained
and
shattered
blades
of
the
propeller
an
of
the
accident
a
described
how
set
out
from
the
aerodrome
on
a
fine
afternoon
there
being
hardly
any
wind
he
was
going
to
france
he
had
made
the
journey
to
and
fro
half
a
dozen
times
or
more
and
felt
perfectly
secure
and
at
ease
rose
to
a
great
height
at
once
and
we
could
scarcely
see
the
machine
i
was
turning
to
go
when
one
of
the
fellows
called
out
say
this
he
pointed
up
and
we
saw
what
looked
like
a
black
cloud
coming
from
the
south
at
a
tremendous
rate
i
saw
at
once
it
a
cloud
it
came
with
a
swirl
and
a
rush
quite
different
from
any
cloud
ever
seen
but
for
a
second
i
make
out
exactly
what
it
was
it
altered
its
shape
and
turned
into
a
great
crescent
and
wheeled
and
veered
about
as
if
it
was
looking
for
something
the
man
who
had
called
out
had
got
his
glasses
and
was
staring
for
all
he
was
worth
then
he
shouted
that
it
was
a
tremendous
flight
of
birds
of
they
went
on
wheeling
and
beating
about
high
up
in
the
air
and
we
were
watching
them
thinking
it
was
interesting
but
not
supposing
that
they
would
make
any
difference
to
who
was
just
about
out
of
sight
his
machine
was
just
a
speck
then
the
two
arms
of
the
crescent
drew
in
as
quick
as
lightning
and
these
thousands
of
birds
shot
in
a
solid
mass
right
up
there
across
the
sky
and
flew
away
somewhere
about
then
henley
the
man
with
the
glasses
called
out
down
and
started
running
and
i
went
after
him
we
got
a
car
and
as
we
were
going
along
henley
told
me
that
seen
the
machine
drop
dead
as
if
it
came
out
of
that
cloud
of
birds
he
thought
then
that
they
must
have
mucked
up
the
propeller
somehow
that
turned
out
to
be
the
case
we
found
the
propeller
blades
all
broken
and
covered
with
blood
and
pigeon
feathers
and
carcasses
of
the
birds
had
got
wedged
in
between
the
blades
and
were
sticking
to
this
was
the
story
that
the
young
airman
told
one
evening
in
a
small
company
he
did
not
speak
confidence
so
i
have
no
hesitation
in
reproducing
what
he
said
naturally
i
did
not
take
a
verbatim
note
of
his
conversation
but
i
have
something
of
a
knack
of
remembering
talk
that
interests
me
and
i
think
my
reproduction
is
very
near
to
the
tale
that
i
heard
and
let
it
be
noted
that
the
flying
man
told
his
story
without
any
sense
or
indication
of
a
sense
that
the
incredible
or
all
but
the
incredible
had
happened
so
far
as
he
knew
he
said
it
was
the
first
accident
of
the
kind
airmen
in
france
had
been
bothered
once
or
twice
by
thought
they
were
viciously
at
them
but
poor
old
had
been
the
first
man
to
come
up
against
a
flight
of
some
thousands
of
pigeons
perhaps
i
shall
be
the
next
he
added
why
look
for
trouble
anyhow
going
to
see
well
i
heard
the
story
as
one
hears
all
the
varied
marvels
and
terrors
of
the
air
as
one
heard
some
years
ago
of
pockets
strange
gulfs
or
voids
in
the
atmosphere
into
which
airmen
fell
with
great
peril
or
as
one
heard
of
the
experience
of
the
airman
who
flew
over
the
cumberland
mountains
in
the
burning
summer
of
and
as
he
swam
far
above
the
heights
was
suddenly
and
vehemently
blown
upwards
the
hot
air
from
the
rocks
striking
his
plane
as
if
it
had
been
a
blast
from
a
furnace
chimney
we
have
just
begun
to
navigate
a
strange
region
we
must
expect
to
encounter
strange
adventures
strange
perils
and
here
a
new
chapter
in
the
chronicles
of
these
perils
and
adventures
had
been
opened
by
the
death
of
and
no
doubt
invention
and
contrivance
would
presently
hit
on
some
way
of
countering
the
new
danger
it
was
i
think
about
a
week
or
ten
days
after
the
death
that
my
business
called
me
to
a
northern
town
the
name
of
which
perhaps
had
better
remain
unknown
my
mission
was
to
inquire
into
certain
charges
of
extravagance
which
had
been
laid
against
the
working
people
that
is
the
munition
workers
of
this
especial
town
it
was
said
that
the
men
who
used
to
earn
a
week
were
now
getting
from
seven
to
eight
pounds
that
of
were
being
paid
two
pounds
instead
of
seven
or
eight
shillings
and
that
in
consequence
there
was
an
orgy
of
foolish
extravagance
the
girls
i
was
told
were
eating
chocolates
at
four
five
and
six
shillings
a
pound
the
women
were
ordering
pianos
which
they
play
and
the
men
bought
gold
chains
at
ten
and
twenty
guineas
apiece
i
dived
into
the
town
in
question
and
found
as
usual
that
there
was
a
mixture
of
truth
and
exaggeration
in
the
stories
that
i
had
heard
gramophones
for
example
they
can
not
be
called
in
strictness
necessaries
but
they
were
undoubtedly
finding
a
ready
sale
even
in
the
more
expensive
brands
and
i
thought
that
there
were
a
great
many
very
spick
and
span
perambulators
to
be
seen
on
the
pavement
smart
perambulators
painted
in
tender
shades
of
color
and
expensively
fitted
how
can
you
be
surprised
if
people
will
have
a
bit
of
a
fling
a
worker
said
to
me
seeing
money
for
the
first
time
in
our
lives
and
bright
and
we
work
hard
for
it
and
we
risk
our
lives
to
get
it
heard
of
explosion
yonder
he
mentioned
certain
works
on
the
outskirts
of
the
town
of
course
neither
the
name
of
the
works
nor
of
the
town
had
been
printed
there
had
been
a
brief
notice
of
at
munition
works
in
the
northern
district
many
the
working
man
told
me
about
it
and
added
some
dreadful
details
let
their
folks
see
bodies
screwed
them
up
in
coffins
as
they
found
them
in
shop
the
gas
had
done
their
faces
black
you
mean
they
were
all
as
if
they
had
been
bitten
to
this
was
a
strange
gas
i
asked
the
man
in
the
northern
town
all
sorts
of
questions
about
the
extraordinary
explosion
of
which
he
had
spoken
to
me
but
he
had
very
little
more
to
say
as
i
have
noted
already
secrets
that
may
not
be
printed
are
often
deeply
kept
last
summer
there
were
very
few
people
outside
high
official
circles
who
knew
anything
about
the
of
which
we
have
all
been
talking
lately
though
these
strange
instruments
of
war
were
being
exercised
and
tested
in
a
park
not
far
from
london
so
the
man
who
told
me
of
the
explosion
in
the
munition
factory
was
most
likely
genuine
in
his
profession
that
he
knew
nothing
more
of
the
disaster
i
found
out
that
he
was
a
smelter
employed
at
a
furnace
on
the
other
side
of
the
town
to
the
ruined
factory
he
know
even
what
they
had
been
making
there
some
very
dangerous
high
explosive
he
supposed
his
information
was
really
nothing
more
than
a
bit
of
gruesome
gossip
which
he
had
heard
probably
at
third
or
fourth
or
fifth
hand
the
horrible
detail
of
faces
if
they
had
been
bitten
to
had
made
its
violent
impression
on
him
that
was
all
i
gave
him
up
and
took
a
tram
to
the
district
of
the
disaster
a
sort
of
industrial
suburb
five
miles
from
the
center
of
the
town
when
i
asked
for
the
factory
i
was
told
that
it
was
no
good
my
going
to
it
as
there
was
nobody
there
but
i
found
it
a
raw
and
hideous
shed
with
a
walled
yard
about
it
and
a
shut
gate
i
looked
for
signs
of
destruction
but
there
was
nothing
the
roof
was
quite
undamaged
and
again
it
struck
me
that
this
had
been
a
strange
accident
there
had
been
an
explosion
of
sufficient
violence
to
kill
workpeople
in
the
building
but
the
building
itself
showed
no
wounds
or
scars
a
man
came
out
of
the
gate
and
locked
it
behind
him
i
began
to
ask
him
some
sort
of
question
or
rather
i
began
to
for
a
question
with
terrible
business
here
they
tell
me
or
some
such
phrase
of
convention
i
got
no
farther
the
man
asked
me
if
i
saw
a
policeman
walking
down
the
street
i
said
i
did
and
i
was
given
the
choice
of
getting
about
my
business
forthwith
or
of
being
instantly
given
in
charge
as
a
spy
better
be
gone
and
quick
about
it
was
i
think
his
final
advice
and
i
took
it
well
i
had
come
literally
up
against
a
brick
wall
thinking
the
problem
over
i
could
only
suppose
that
the
smelter
or
his
informant
had
twisted
the
phrases
of
the
story
the
smelter
had
said
the
dead
faces
were
to
this
might
be
an
unconscious
perversion
of
that
phrase
might
describe
well
enough
the
effect
of
strong
acids
and
for
all
i
knew
of
the
processes
of
such
acids
might
be
used
and
might
explode
with
horrible
results
in
some
perilous
stage
of
their
admixture
it
was
a
day
or
two
later
that
the
accident
to
the
airman
came
into
my
mind
for
one
of
those
instants
which
are
far
shorter
than
any
measure
of
time
there
flashed
out
the
possibility
of
a
link
between
the
two
disasters
but
here
was
a
wild
impossibility
and
i
drove
it
away
and
yet
i
think
that
the
thought
mad
as
it
seemed
never
left
me
it
was
the
secret
light
that
at
last
guided
me
through
a
somber
grove
of
enigmas
it
was
about
this
time
so
far
as
the
date
can
be
fixed
that
a
whole
district
one
might
say
a
whole
county
was
visited
by
a
series
of
extraordinary
and
terrible
calamities
which
were
the
more
terrible
inasmuch
as
they
continued
for
some
time
to
be
inscrutable
mysteries
it
is
indeed
doubtful
whether
these
awful
events
do
not
still
remain
mysteries
to
many
of
those
concerned
for
before
the
inhabitants
of
this
part
of
the
country
had
time
to
join
one
link
of
evidence
to
another
the
circular
was
issued
and
thenceforth
no
one
knew
how
to
distinguish
undoubted
fact
from
wild
and
extravagant
surmise
the
district
in
question
is
in
the
far
west
of
wales
i
shall
call
it
for
convenience
meirion
in
it
there
is
one
seaside
town
of
some
repute
with
for
five
or
six
weeks
in
the
summer
and
dotted
about
the
county
there
are
three
or
four
small
old
towns
that
seem
drooping
in
a
slow
decay
sleepy
and
gray
with
age
and
forgetfulness
they
remind
me
of
what
i
have
read
of
towns
in
the
west
of
ireland
grass
grows
between
the
uneven
stones
of
the
pavements
the
signs
above
the
shop
windows
decline
half
the
letters
of
these
signs
are
missing
here
and
there
a
house
has
been
pulled
down
or
has
been
allowed
to
slide
into
ruin
and
wild
greenery
springs
up
through
the
fallen
stones
and
there
is
silence
in
all
the
streets
and
it
is
to
be
noted
these
are
not
places
that
were
once
magnificent
the
celts
have
never
had
the
art
of
building
and
so
far
as
i
can
see
such
towns
as
towy
and
merthyr
tegveth
and
meiros
must
have
been
always
much
as
they
are
now
clusters
of
poorish
houses
and
down
at
heel
and
these
few
towns
are
thinly
scattered
over
a
wild
country
where
north
is
divided
from
south
by
a
wilder
mountain
range
one
of
these
places
is
sixteen
miles
from
any
station
the
others
are
doubtfully
and
deviously
connected
by
railways
served
by
rare
trains
that
pause
and
stagger
and
hesitate
on
their
slow
journey
up
mountain
passes
or
stop
for
half
an
hour
or
more
at
lonely
sheds
called
stations
situated
in
the
midst
of
desolate
marshes
a
few
years
ago
i
traveled
with
an
irishman
on
one
of
these
queer
lines
and
he
looked
to
right
and
saw
the
bog
with
its
yellow
and
blue
grasses
and
stagnant
pools
and
he
looked
to
left
and
saw
a
ragged
hillside
set
with
gray
stone
walls
can
hardly
believe
he
said
not
still
in
the
wilds
of
here
then
one
sees
a
wild
and
divided
and
scattered
region
a
land
of
outland
hills
and
secret
and
hidden
valleys
i
know
white
farms
on
this
coast
which
must
be
separate
by
two
hours
of
hard
rough
walking
from
any
other
habitation
which
are
invisible
from
any
other
house
and
inland
again
the
farms
are
often
ringed
about
by
thick
groves
of
ash
planted
by
men
of
old
days
to
shelter
their
from
rude
winds
of
the
mountain
and
stormy
winds
of
the
sea
so
that
these
places
too
are
hidden
away
to
be
surmised
only
by
the
wood
smoke
that
rises
from
the
green
surrounding
leaves
a
londoner
must
see
them
to
believe
in
them
and
even
then
he
can
scarcely
credit
their
utter
isolation
such
then
in
the
main
is
meirion
and
on
this
land
in
the
early
summer
of
last
year
terror
terror
without
shape
such
as
no
man
there
had
ever
known
it
began
with
the
tale
of
a
little
child
who
wandered
out
into
the
lanes
to
pick
flowers
one
sunny
afternoon
and
never
came
back
to
the
cottage
on
the
hill
chapter
ii
death
in
the
village
the
child
who
was
lost
came
from
a
lonely
cottage
that
stands
on
the
slope
of
a
steep
hillside
called
the
allt
or
the
height
the
land
about
it
is
wild
and
ragged
here
the
growth
of
gorse
and
bracken
here
a
marshy
hollow
of
reeds
and
rushes
marking
the
course
of
the
stream
from
some
hidden
well
here
thickets
of
dense
and
tangled
undergrowth
the
outposts
of
the
wood
down
through
this
broken
and
uneven
ground
a
path
leads
to
the
lane
at
the
bottom
of
the
valley
then
the
land
rises
again
and
swells
up
to
the
cliffs
over
the
sea
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
away
the
little
girl
gertrude
morgan
asked
her
mother
if
she
might
go
down
to
the
lane
and
pick
the
purple
were
grew
there
and
her
mother
gave
her
leave
telling
her
she
must
be
sure
to
be
back
by
as
there
was
for
tea
she
never
came
back
it
was
supposed
that
she
must
have
crossed
the
road
and
gone
to
the
edge
possibly
in
order
to
pick
the
that
were
then
in
full
blossom
she
must
have
slipped
they
said
and
fallen
into
the
sea
two
hundred
feet
below
and
it
may
be
said
at
once
that
there
was
no
doubt
some
truth
in
this
conjecture
though
it
stopped
very
far
short
of
the
whole
truth
the
body
must
have
been
carried
out
by
the
tide
for
it
was
never
found
the
conjecture
of
a
false
step
or
of
a
fatal
slide
on
the
slippery
turf
that
slopes
down
to
the
rocks
was
accepted
as
being
the
only
explanation
possible
people
thought
the
accident
a
strange
one
because
as
a
rule
country
children
living
by
the
cliffs
and
the
sea
become
wary
at
an
early
age
and
gertrude
morgan
was
almost
ten
years
old
still
as
the
neighbors
said
how
it
must
have
happened
and
a
great
pity
to
be
but
this
would
not
do
when
in
a
time
a
strong
young
laborer
failed
to
come
to
his
cottage
after
the
work
his
body
was
found
on
the
rocks
six
or
seven
miles
from
the
cliffs
where
the
child
was
supposed
to
have
fallen
he
was
going
home
by
a
path
that
he
had
used
every
night
of
his
life
for
eight
or
nine
years
that
he
used
of
dark
nights
in
perfect
security
knowing
every
inch
of
it
the
police
asked
if
he
drank
but
he
was
a
teetotaler
if
he
were
subject
to
fits
but
he
and
he
was
not
murdered
for
his
wealth
since
agricultural
laborers
are
not
wealthy
it
was
only
possible
again
to
talk
of
slippery
turf
and
a
false
step
but
people
began
to
be
frightened
then
a
woman
was
found
with
her
neck
broken
at
the
bottom
of
a
disused
quarry
near
llanfihangel
in
the
middle
of
the
county
the
theory
was
eliminated
here
for
the
quarry
was
guarded
with
a
natural
hedge
of
gorse
bushes
one
would
have
to
struggle
and
fight
through
sharp
thorns
to
destruction
in
such
a
place
as
this
and
indeed
the
gorse
bushes
were
broken
as
if
some
one
had
rushed
furiously
through
them
just
above
the
place
where
the
body
was
found
and
this
was
strange
there
was
a
dead
sheep
lying
beside
her
in
the
pit
as
if
the
woman
and
the
sheep
together
had
been
chased
over
the
brim
of
the
quarry
but
chased
by
whom
or
by
what
and
then
there
was
a
new
form
of
terror
this
was
in
the
region
of
the
marshes
under
the
mountain
a
man
and
his
son
a
lad
of
fourteen
or
fifteen
set
out
early
one
morning
to
work
and
never
reached
the
farm
where
they
were
bound
their
way
skirted
the
marsh
but
it
was
broad
firm
and
well
metalled
and
it
had
been
raised
about
two
feet
above
the
bog
but
when
search
was
made
in
the
evening
of
the
same
day
phillips
and
his
son
were
found
dead
in
the
marsh
covered
with
black
slime
and
pondweed
and
they
lay
some
ten
yards
from
the
path
which
it
would
seem
they
must
have
left
deliberately
it
was
useless
of
course
to
look
for
tracks
in
the
black
ooze
for
if
one
threw
a
big
stone
into
it
a
few
seconds
removed
all
marks
of
the
disturbance
the
men
who
found
the
two
bodies
beat
about
the
verges
and
purlieus
of
the
marsh
in
hope
of
finding
some
trace
of
the
murderers
they
went
to
and
fro
over
the
rising
ground
where
the
black
cattle
were
grazing
they
searched
the
alder
thickets
by
the
brook
but
they
discovered
nothing
most
horrible
of
all
these
horrors
perhaps
was
the
affair
of
the
highway
a
lonely
and
unfrequented
that
winds
for
many
miles
on
high
and
lonely
land
here
a
mile
from
any
other
dwelling
stands
a
cottage
on
the
edge
of
a
dark
wood
it
was
inhabited
by
a
laborer
named
williams
his
wife
and
their
three
children
one
hot
evening
a
man
who
had
been
doing
a
gardening
at
a
rectory
three
or
four
miles
away
passed
the
cottage
and
stopped
for
a
few
minutes
to
chat
with
williams
the
laborer
who
was
pottering
about
his
garden
while
the
children
were
playing
on
the
path
by
the
door
the
two
talked
of
their
neighbors
and
of
the
potatoes
till
williams
appeared
at
the
doorway
and
said
supper
was
ready
and
williams
turned
to
go
into
the
house
this
was
about
eight
and
in
the
ordinary
course
the
family
would
have
their
supper
and
be
in
bed
by
nine
or
by
nine
at
latest
at
ten
that
night
the
local
doctor
was
driving
home
along
the
highway
his
horse
shied
violently
and
then
stopped
dead
just
opposite
the
gate
to
the
cottage
the
doctor
got
down
frightened
at
what
he
saw
and
there
on
the
roadway
lay
williams
his
wife
and
the
three
children
stone
dead
all
of
them
their
skulls
were
battered
in
as
if
by
some
heavy
iron
instrument
their
faces
were
beaten
into
a
pulp
chapter
iii
the
theory
it
is
not
easy
to
make
any
picture
of
the
horror
that
lay
dark
on
the
hearts
of
the
people
of
meirion
it
was
no
longer
possible
to
believe
or
to
pretend
to
believe
that
these
men
and
women
and
children
had
met
their
deaths
through
strange
accidents
the
little
girl
and
the
young
laborer
might
have
slipped
and
fallen
over
the
cliffs
but
the
woman
who
lay
dead
with
the
dead
sheep
at
the
bottom
of
the
quarry
the
two
men
who
had
been
lured
into
the
ooze
of
the
marsh
the
family
who
were
found
murdered
on
the
highway
before
their
own
cottage
door
in
these
cases
there
could
be
no
room
for
the
supposition
of
accident
it
seemed
as
if
it
were
impossible
to
frame
any
conjecture
or
outline
of
a
conjecture
that
would
account
for
these
hideous
and
as
it
seemed
utterly
purposeless
crimes
for
a
time
people
said
that
there
must
be
a
madman
at
large
a
sort
of
country
variant
of
jack
the
ripper
some
horrible
pervert
who
was
possessed
by
the
passion
of
death
who
prowled
darkling
about
that
lonely
land
hiding
in
woods
and
in
wild
places
always
watching
and
seeking
for
the
victims
of
his
desire
indeed
lewis
who
found
poor
williams
his
wife
and
children
miserably
slaughtered
on
the
highway
was
convinced
at
first
that
the
presence
of
a
concealed
madman
in
the
countryside
offered
the
only
possible
solution
to
the
difficulty
felt
sure
he
said
to
me
afterwards
the
had
been
killed
by
a
homicidal
maniac
it
was
the
nature
of
the
poor
injuries
that
convinced
me
that
this
was
the
case
some
years
or
years
ago
as
a
matter
of
had
something
to
do
with
a
case
which
on
the
face
of
it
had
a
strong
likeness
to
the
highway
murder
at
that
time
i
had
a
practice
at
usk

whole

the
roadside
were
murdered
one
evening
it
was
called
i
think
the
llangibby
murder
the
cottage
was
near
the
village
of
that
name
the
murderer
was
caught
in
newport
he
was
a
spanish
sailor
named
garcia
and
it
appeared
that
he
had
killed
father
mother
and
the
three
children
for
the
sake
of
the
brass
works
of
an
old
dutch
clock
which
were
found
on
him
when
he
was
arrested
had
been
serving
a
imprisonment
in
usk
jail
for
some
small
theft
and
on
his
release
he
set
out
to
walk
to
newport
nine
or
ten
miles
away
no
doubt
to
get
another
ship
he
passed
the
cottage
and
saw
the
man
working
in
his
garden
garcia
stabbed
him
with
his
knife
the
wife
rushed
out
he
stabbed
her
then
he
went
into
the
cottage
and
stabbed
the
three
children
tried
to
set
the
place
on
fire
and
made
off
with
the
clockworks
that
looked
like
the
deed
of
a
madman
but
garcia
hanged
him
i
may
was
merely
a
man
of
a
very
low
type
a
degenerate
who
the
slightest
value
for
human
life
i
am
not
sure
but
i
think
he
came
from
one
of
the
spanish
islands
where
the
people
are
said
to
be
degenerates
very
likely
from
too
much
my
point
is
that
garcia
stabbed
to
kill
and
did
kill
with
one
blow
in
each
case
there
was
no
senseless
hacking
and
slashing
now
those
poor
people
on
the
highway
had
their
heads
smashed
to
pieces
by
what
must
have
been
a
storm
of
blows
any
one
of
them
would
have
been
fatal
but
the
murderer
must
have
gone
on
raining
blows
with
his
iron
hammer
on
people
who
were
already
stone
dead
and
sort
of
thing
is
the
work
of
a
madman
and
nothing
but
a
madman
how
i
argued
the
matter
out
to
myself
just
after
the
event
was
utterly
wrong
monstrously
wrong
but
who
could
have
suspected
the
truth
thus
lewis
and
i
quote
him
or
the
substance
of
him
as
representative
of
most
of
the
educated
opinion
of
the
district
at
the
beginnings
of
the
terror
people
seized
on
this
theory
largely
because
it
offered
at
least
the
comfort
of
an
explanation
and
any
explanation
even
the
poorest
is
better
than
an
intolerable
and
terrible
mystery
besides
theory
was
plausible
it
explained
the
lack
of
purpose
that
seemed
to
characterize
the
murders
and
were
difficulties
even
from
the
first
it
was
hardly
possible
that
a
strange
madman
should
be
able
to
keep
hidden
in
a
countryside
where
any
stranger
is
instantly
noted
and
noticed
sooner
or
later
he
would
be
seen
as
he
prowled
along
the
lanes
or
across
the
wild
places
indeed
a
drunken
cheerful
and
altogether
harmless
tramp
was
arrested
by
a
farmer
and
his
man
in
the
fact
and
act
of
sleeping
off
beer
under
a
hedge
but
the
vagrant
was
able
to
prove
complete
and
undoubted
alibis
and
was
soon
allowed
to
go
on
his
wandering
way
then
another
theory
or
rather
a
variant
of
theory
was
started
this
was
to
the
effect
that
the
person
responsible
for
the
outrages
was
indeed
a
madman
but
a
madman
only
at
intervals
it
was
one
of
the
members
of
the
porth
club
a
certain
mr
remnant
who
was
supposed
to
have
originated
this
more
subtle
explanation
mr
remnant
was
a
man
who
having
nothing
particular
to
do
read
a
great
many
books
by
way
of
conquering
the
hours
he
talked
to
the
retired
colonels
parsons
quoted
various
psychological
textbooks
in
support
of
his
contention
that
personality
was
sometimes
fluid
and
unstable
went
back
to
jekyll
and
as
good
evidence
of
this
proposition
and
laid
stress
on
speculation
that
the
human
soul
so
far
from
being
one
and
indivisible
might
possibly
turn
out
to
be
a
mere
polity
a
state
in
which
dwelt
many
strange
and
incongruous
citizens
whose
characters
were
not
merely
unknown
but
altogether
unsurmised
by
that
form
of
consciousness
which
so
rashly
assumed
that
it
was
not
only
the
president
of
the
republic
but
also
its
sole
citizen
long
and
the
short
of
it
is
mr
remnant
concluded
any
one
of
us
may
be
the
murderer
though
he
the
faintest
notion
of
the
fact
take
llewelyn
payne
llewelyn
was
an
elderly
lawyer
a
rural
tulkinghorn
he
was
the
hereditary
solicitor
to
the
morgans
of
pentwyn
this
does
not
sound
anything
tremendous
to
the
saxons
of
london
but
the
style
is
far
more
than
noble
to
the
celts
of
west
wales
it
is
immemorial
teilo
sant
was
of
the
collaterals
of
the
first
known
chief
of
the
race
and
payne
llewelyn
did
his
best
to
look
like
the
legal
adviser
of
this
ancient
house
he
was
weighty
he
was
cautious
he
was
sound
he
was
secure
i
have
compared
him
to
tulkinghorn
of
inn
fields
but
llewelyn
would
most
certainly
never
have
dreamed
of
employing
his
leisure
in
peering
into
the
cupboards
where
the
family
skeletons
were
hidden
supposing
such
cupboards
to
have
existed
payne
llewelyn
would
have
risked
large
expenses
to
furnish
them
with
double
triple
impregnable
locks
he
was
a
new
man
an
certainly
for
he
was
partly
of
the
conquest
being
descended
on
one
side
from
sir
payne
turberville
but
he
meant
to
stand
by
the
old
stock
llewelyn
now
said
mr
remnant
here
llewelyn
can
you
produce
evidence
to
show
where
you
were
on
the
night
those
people
were
murdered
on
the
highway
i
thought
llewelyn
an
elderly
man
as
i
have
said
hesitated
before
speaking
thought
not
remnant
went
on
i
say
that
it
is
perfectly
possible
that
llewelyn
may
be
dealing
death
throughout
meirion
although
in
his
present
personality
he
may
not
have
the
faintest
suspicion
that
there
is
another
llewelyn
within
him
a
llewelyn
who
follows
murder
as
a
fine
payne
llewelyn
did
not
at
all
relish
suggestion
that
he
might
well
be
a
secret
murderer
ravening
for
blood
remorseless
as
a
wild
beast
he
thought
the
phrase
about
his
following
murder
as
a
fine
art
was
both
nonsensical
and
in
the
worst
taste
and
his
opinion
was
not
changed
when
remnant
pointed
out
that
it
was
used
by
de
quincey
in
the
title
of
one
of
his
most
famous
essays
you
had
allowed
me
to
speak
he
said
with
some
coldness
of
manner
would
have
told
you
that
on
tuesday
last
the
night
on
which
those
unfortunate
people
were
murdered
on
the
highway
i
was
staying
at
the
angel
hotel
cardiff
i
had
business
in
cardiff
and
i
was
detained
till
wednesday
having
given
this
satisfactory
alibi
payne
llewelyn
left
the
club
and
did
not
go
near
it
for
the
rest
of
the
week
remnant
explained
to
those
who
stayed
in
the
smoking
room
that
of
course
he
had
merely
used
llewelyn
as
a
concrete
example
of
his
theory
which
he
persisted
had
the
support
of
a
considerable
body
of
evidence
are
several
cases
of
double
personality
on
record
he
declared
i
say
again
that
it
is
quite
possible
that
these
murders
may
have
been
committed
by
one
of
us
in
his
secondary
personality
why
i
may
be
the
murderer
in
my
remnant
state
though
remnant
knows
nothing
whatever
about
it
and
is
perfectly
convinced
that
he
could
not
kill
a
fowl
much
less
a
whole
family
it
so
lewis
lewis
said
it
was
so
in
theory
but
he
thought
not
in
fact
of
the
cases
of
double
or
multiple
personality
that
have
been
investigated
he
said
been
in
connection
with
the
very
dubious
experiments
of
hypnotism
or
the
still
more
dubious
experiments
of
spiritualism
all
that
sort
of
thing
in
my
opinion
is
like
tinkering
with
the
works
of
a
tinkering
i
mean
you
fumble
about
with
the
wheels
and
cogs
and
bits
of
mechanism
that
you
really
know
anything
about
and
then
you
find
your
clock
going
backwards
or
striking
at
and
i
believe
just
the
same
thing
with
these
psychical
research
experiments
the
secondary
personality
is
very
likely
the
result
of
the
tinkering
and
fumbling
with
a
very
delicate
apparatus
that
we
know
nothing
about
mind
i
say
that
impossible
for
one
of
us
to
be
the
highway
murderer
in
his
state
as
remnant
puts
it
but
i
think
extremely
improbable
probability
is
the
guide
of
life
you
know
remnant
said
lewis
smiling
at
that
gentleman
as
if
to
say
that
he
also
had
done
a
little
reading
in
his
day
it
follows
therefore
that
improbability
is
also
the
guide
of
life
when
you
get
a
very
high
degree
of
probability
that
is
you
are
justified
in
taking
it
as
a
certainty
and
on
the
other
hand
if
a
supposition
is
highly
improbable
you
are
justified
in
treating
it
as
an
impossible
one
that
is
in
nine
hundred
and
cases
out
of
a
about
the
thousandth
case
said
remnant
these
extraordinary
crimes
constitute
the
thousandth
case
the
doctor
smiled
and
shrugged
his
shoulders
being
tired
of
the
subject
but
for
some
little
time
highly
respectable
members
of
porth
society
would
look
suspiciously
at
one
another
wondering
whether
after
all
there
be
in
however
both
somewhat
crazy
theory
and
plausible
theory
became
untenable
when
two
more
victims
of
an
awful
and
mysterious
death
were
offered
up
in
sacrifice
for
a
man
was
found
dead
in
the
llanfihangel
quarry
where
the
woman
had
been
discovered
and
on
the
same
day
a
girl
of
fifteen
was
found
broken
on
the
jagged
rocks
under
the
cliffs
near
porth
now
it
appeared
that
these
two
deaths
must
have
occurred
at
about
the
same
time
within
an
hour
of
one
another
certainly
and
the
distance
between
the
quarry
and
the
cliffs
by
black
rock
is
certainly
twenty
miles
motor
could
do
it
one
man
said
but
it
was
pointed
out
that
there
was
no
high
road
between
the
two
places
indeed
it
might
be
said
that
there
was
no
road
at
all
between
them
there
was
a
network
of
deep
narrow
and
tortuous
lanes
that
wandered
into
one
another
at
all
manner
of
queer
angles
for
say
seventeen
miles
this
in
the
middle
as
it
were
between
black
rock
and
the
quarry
at
llanfihangel
but
to
get
to
the
high
land
of
the
cliffs
one
had
to
take
a
path
that
went
through
two
miles
of
fields
and
the
quarry
lay
a
mile
away
from
the
nearest
in
the
midst
of
gorse
and
bracken
and
broken
land
and
finally
there
was
no
track
of
or
in
the
lanes
which
must
have
been
followed
to
pass
from
one
place
to
the
other
about
an
airplane
then
said
the
man
of
the
theory
well
there
was
certainly
an
aerodrome
not
far
from
one
of
the
two
places
of
death
but
somehow
nobody
believed
that
the
flying
corps
harbored
a
homicidal
maniac
it
seemed
clear
therefore
that
there
must
be
more
than
one
person
concerned
in
the
terror
of
meirion
and
lewis
himself
abandoned
his
own
theory
i
said
to
remnant
at
the
club
he
remarked
is
the
guide
of
life
i
believe
that
there
are
a
pack
of
madmen
or
even
two
madmen
at
large
in
the
country
i
give
it
and
now
a
fresh
circumstance
or
set
of
circumstances
became
manifest
to
confound
judgment
and
to
awaken
new
and
wild
surmises
for
at
about
this
time
people
realized
that
none
of
the
dreadful
events
that
were
happening
all
about
them
was
so
much
as
mentioned
in
the
press
i
have
already
spoken
of
the
fate
of
the
this
paper
was
suppressed
by
the
authorities
because
it
had
inserted
a
brief
paragraph
about
some
person
who
had
been
dead
under
mysterious
i
think
that
paragraph
referred
to
the
first
death
of
llanfihangel
quarry
thenceforth
horror
followed
on
horror
but
no
word
was
printed
in
any
of
the
local
journals
the
curious
went
to
the
newspaper
were
two
left
in
the
found
nothing
save
a
firm
refusal
to
discuss
the
matter
and
the
cardiff
papers
were
drawn
and
found
blank
and
the
london
press
was
apparently
ignorant
of
the
fact
that
crimes
that
had
no
parallel
were
terrorizing
a
whole
countryside
everybody
wondered
what
could
have
happened
what
was
happening
and
then
it
was
whispered
that
the
coroner
would
allow
no
inquiry
to
be
made
as
to
these
deaths
of
darkness
consequence
of
instructions
received
from
the
home
office
one
coroner
was
understood
to
have
said
have
to
tell
the
jury
that
their
business
will
be
to
hear
the
medical
evidence
and
to
bring
in
a
verdict
immediately
in
accordance
with
that
evidence
i
shall
disallow
all
one
jury
protested
the
foreman
refused
to
bring
in
any
verdict
at
all
good
said
the
coroner
i
beg
to
inform
you
foreman
and
gentlemen
of
the
jury
that
under
the
defense
of
the
realm
act
i
have
power
to
supersede
your
functions
and
to
enter
a
verdict
according
to
the
evidence
which
has
been
laid
before
the
court
as
if
it
had
been
the
verdict
of
you
the
foreman
and
jury
collapsed
and
accepted
what
they
could
not
avoid
but
the
rumors
that
got
abroad
of
all
this
added
to
the
known
fact
that
the
terror
was
ignored
in
the
press
no
doubt
by
official
command
increased
the
panic
that
was
now
arising
and
gave
it
a
new
direction
clearly
people
reasoned
these
government
restrictions
and
prohibitions
could
only
refer
to
the
war
to
some
great
danger
in
connection
with
the
war
and
that
being
so
it
followed
that
the
outrages
which
must
be
kept
so
secret
were
the
work
of
the
enemy
that
is
of
concealed
german
agents
chapter
iv
the
spread
of
the
terror
it
is
time
i
think
for
me
to
make
one
point
clear
i
began
this
history
with
certain
references
to
an
extraordinary
accident
to
an
airman
whose
machine
fell
to
the
ground
after
collision
with
a
huge
flock
of
pigeons
and
then
to
an
explosion
in
a
northern
munition
factory
an
explosion
as
i
noted
of
a
very
singular
kind
then
i
deserted
the
neighborhood
of
london
and
the
northern
district
and
dwelt
on
a
mysterious
and
terrible
series
of
events
which
occurred
in
the
summer
of
in
a
welsh
county
which
i
have
named
for
convenience
meirion
well
let
it
be
understood
at
once
that
all
this
detail
that
i
have
given
about
the
occurrences
in
meirion
does
not
imply
that
the
county
in
the
far
west
was
alone
or
especially
afflicted
by
the
terror
that
was
over
the
land
they
tell
me
that
in
the
villages
about
dartmoor
the
stout
devonshire
hearts
sank
as
hearts
used
to
sink
in
the
time
of
plague
and
pestilence
there
was
horror
too
about
the
norfolk
broads
and
far
up
by
perth
no
one
would
venture
on
the
path
that
leads
by
scone
to
the
wooded
heights
above
the
tay
and
in
the
industrial
districts
i
met
a
man
by
chance
one
day
in
an
odd
london
corner
who
spoke
with
horror
of
what
a
friend
had
told
him
no
questions
ned
he
says
to
me
i
tell
yow
was
in
bairnigan
day
and
met
a
pal
seen
three
hundred
coffins
going
out
of
a
works
not
far
from
and
then
the
ship
that
hovered
outside
the
mouth
of
the
thames
with
all
sails
set
and
beat
to
and
fro
in
the
wind
and
never
answered
any
hail
and
showed
no
light
the
forts
shot
at
her
and
brought
down
one
of
the
masts
but
she
went
suddenly
about
with
a
change
of
wind
under
what
sail
still
stood
and
then
veered
down
channel
and
drove
ashore
at
last
on
the
sandbanks
and
pinewoods
of
arcachon
and
not
a
man
alive
on
her
but
only
rattling
heaps
of
bones
that
last
voyage
of
the
would
be
something
horribly
worth
telling
but
i
only
heard
it
at
a
distance
as
a
yarn
and
only
believed
it
because
it
squared
with
other
things
that
i
knew
for
certain
this
then
is
my
point
i
have
written
of
the
terror
as
it
fell
on
meirion
simply
because
i
have
had
opportunities
of
getting
close
there
to
what
really
happened

or
fourth
or
fifth
hand
in
the
other
places
but
round
about
porth
and
merthyr
tegveth
i
have
spoken
with
people
who
have
seen
the
tracks
of
the
terror
with
their
own
eyes
well
i
have
said
that
the
people
of
that
far
western
county
realized
not
only
that
death
was
abroad
in
their
quiet
lanes
and
on
their
peaceful
hills
but
that
for
some
reason
it
was
to
be
kept
all
secret
newspapers
might
not
print
any
news
of
it
the
very
juries
summoned
to
investigate
it
were
allowed
to
investigate
nothing
and
so
they
concluded
that
this
veil
of
secrecy
must
somehow
be
connected
with
the
war
and
from
this
position
it
was
not
a
long
way
to
a
further
inference
that
the
murderers
of
innocent
men
and
women
and
children
were
either
germans
or
agents
of
germany
it
would
be
just
like
the
huns
everybody
agreed
to
think
out
such
a
devilish
scheme
as
this
and
they
always
thought
out
their
schemes
beforehand
they
hoped
to
seize
paris
in
a
few
weeks
but
when
they
were
beaten
on
the
marne
they
had
their
trenches
on
the
aisne
ready
to
fall
back
on
it
had
all
been
prepared
years
before
the
war
and
so
no
doubt
they
had
devised
this
terrible
plan
against
england
in
case
they
could
not
beat
us
in
open
fight
there
were
people
ready
very
likely
all
over
the
country
who
were
prepared
to
murder
and
destroy
everywhere
as
soon
as
they
got
the
word
in
this
way
the
germans
intended
to
sow
terror
throughout
england
and
fill
our
hearts
with
panic
and
dismay
hoping
so
to
weaken
their
enemy
at
home
that
he
would
lose
all
heart
over
the
war
abroad
it
was
the
zeppelin
notion
in
another
form
they
were
committing
these
horrible
and
mysterious
outrages
thinking
that
we
should
be
frightened
out
of
our
wits
it
all
seemed
plausible
enough
germany
had
by
this
time
perpetrated
so
many
horrors
and
had
so
excelled
in
devilish
ingenuities
that
no
abomination
seemed
too
abominable
to
be
probable
or
too
ingeniously
wicked
to
be
beyond
the
tortuous
malice
of
the
hun
but
then
came
the
questions
as
to
who
the
agents
of
this
terrible
design
were
as
to
where
they
lived
as
to
how
they
contrived
to
move
unseen
from
field
to
field
from
lane
to
lane
all
sorts
of
fantastic
attempts
were
made
to
answer
these
questions
but
it
was
felt
that
they
remained
unanswered
some
suggested
that
the
murderers
landed
from
submarines
or
flew
from
hiding
places
on
the
west
coast
of
ireland
coming
and
going
by
night
but
there
were
seen
to
be
flagrant
impossibilities
in
both
these
suggestions
everybody
agreed
that
the
evil
work
was
no
doubt
the
work
of
germany
but
nobody
could
begin
to
guess
how
it
was
done
somebody
at
the
club
asked
remnant
for
his
theory
theory
said
that
ingenious
person
that
human
progress
is
simply
a
long
march
from
one
inconceivable
to
another
look
at
that
airship
of
ours
that
came
over
porth
yesterday
ten
years
ago
that
would
have
been
an
inconceivable
sight
take
the
steam
engine
stake
printing
take
the
theory
of
gravitation
they
were
all
inconceivable
till
somebody
thought
of
them
so
it
is
no
doubt
with
this
infernal
dodgery
that
talking
about
the
huns
have
found
it
out
and
we
and
there
you
are
we
conceive
how
these
poor
people
have
been
murdered
because
the
inconceivable
to
the
club
listened
with
some
awe
to
this
high
argument
after
remnant
had
gone
one
member
said
man
said
lewis
was
asked
whether
he
knew
something
and
his
reply
really
amounted
to
i
but
i
have
never
heard
it
better
it
was
i
suppose
at
about
this
time
when
the
people
were
puzzling
their
heads
as
to
the
secret
methods
used
by
the
germans
or
their
agents
to
accomplish
their
crimes
that
a
very
singular
circumstance
became
known
to
a
few
of
the
porth
people
it
related
to
the
murder
of
the
williams
family
on
the
highway
in
front
of
their
cottage
door
i
do
not
know
that
i
have
made
it
plain
that
the
old
roman
road
called
the
highway
follows
the
course
of
a
long
steep
hill
that
goes
steadily
westward
till
it
slants
down
and
droops
towards
the
sea
on
either
side
of
the
road
the
ground
falls
away
here
into
deep
shadowy
woods
here
to
high
pastures
now
and
again
into
a
field
of
corn
but
for
the
most
part
into
the
wild
and
broken
land
that
is
characteristic
of
arfon
the
fields
are
long
and
narrow
stretching
up
the
steep
hillside
they
fall
into
sudden
dips
and
hollows
a
well
springs
up
in
the
midst
of
one
and
a
grove
of
ash
and
thorn
bends
over
it
shading
it
and
beneath
it
the
ground
is
thick
with
reeds
and
rushes
and
then
may
come
on
either
side
of
such
a
field
territories
glistening
with
the
deep
growth
of
bracken
and
rough
with
gorse
and
rugged
with
thickets
of
blackthorn
green
lichen
hanging
strangely
from
the
branches
such
are
the
lands
on
either
side
of
the
highway
now
on
the
lower
slopes
of
it
beneath
the
cottage
some
three
or
four
fields
down
the
hill
there
is
a
military
camp
the
place
has
been
used
as
a
camp
for
many
years
and
lately
the
site
has
been
extended
and
huts
have
been
erected
but
a
considerable
number
of
the
men
were
under
canvas
here
in
the
summer
of
on
the
night
of
the
highway
murder
this
camp
as
it
appeared
afterwards
was
the
scene
of
the
extraordinary
panic
of
the
horses
a
good
many
men
in
the
camp
were
asleep
in
their
tents
soon
after
when
the
last
post
was
sounded
they
woke
up
in
panic
there
was
a
thundering
sound
on
the
steep
hillside
above
them
and
down
upon
the
tents
came
half
a
dozen
horses
mad
with
fright
trampling
the
canvas
trampling
the
men
bruising
dozens
of
them
and
killing
two
everything
was
in
wild
confusion
men
groaning
and
screaming
in
the
darkness
struggling
with
the
canvas
and
the
twisted
ropes
shouting
out
some
of
them
raw
lads
enough
that
the
germans
had
landed
others
wiping
the
blood
from
their
eyes
a
few
roused
suddenly
from
heavy
sleep
hitting
out
at
one
another
officers
coming
up
at
the
double
roaring
out
orders
to
the
sergeants
a
party
of
soldiers
who
were
just
returning
to
camp
from
the
village
seized
with
fright
at
what
they
could
scarcely
see
or
distinguish
at
the
wildness
of
the
shouting
and
cursing
and
groaning
that
they
could
not
understand
bolting
out
of
the
camp
again
and
racing
for
their
lives
back
to
the
village
everything
in
the
maddest
confusion
of
wild
disorder
some
of
the
men
had
seen
the
horses
galloping
down
the
hill
as
if
terror
itself
was
driving
them
they
scattered
off
into
the
darkness
and
somehow
or
another
found
their
way
back
in
the
night
to
their
pasture
above
the
camp
they
were
grazing
there
peacefully
in
the
morning
and
the
only
sign
of
the
panic
of
the
night
before
was
the
mud
they
had
scattered
all
over
themselves
as
they
pelted
through
a
patch
of
wet
ground
the
farmer
said
they
were
as
quiet
a
lot
as
any
in
meirion
he
could
make
nothing
of
it
he
said
believe
they
must
have
seen
the
devil
himself
to
be
in
such
a
fright
as
that
save
the
people
now
all
this
was
kept
as
quiet
as
might
be
at
the
time
when
it
happened
it
became
known
to
the
men
of
the
porth
club
in
the
days
when
they
were
discussing
the
difficult
question
of
the
german
outrages
as
the
murders
were
commonly
called
and
this
wild
stampede
of
the
farm
horses
was
held
by
some
to
be
evidence
of
the
extraordinary
and
unheard
of
character
of
the
dreadful
agency
that
was
at
work
one
of
the
members
of
the
club
had
been
told
by
an
officer
who
was
in
the
camp
at
the
time
of
the
panic
that
the
horses
that
came
charging
down
were
in
a
perfect
fury
of
fright
that
he
had
never
seen
horses
in
such
a
state
and
so
there
was
endless
speculation
as
to
the
nature
of
the
sight
or
the
sound
that
had
driven
half
a
dozen
quiet
beasts
into
raging
madness
then
in
the
middle
of
this
talk
two
or
three
other
incidents
quite
as
odd
and
incomprehensible
came
to
be
known
borne
on
chance
trickles
of
gossip
that
came
into
the
towns
from
outland
farms
or
were
carried
by
cottagers
tramping
into
porth
on
market
day
with
a
fowl
or
two
and
eggs
and
garden
stuff
scraps
and
fragments
of
talk
gathered
by
servants
from
the
country
folk
and
their
mistresses
and
in
such
ways
it
came
out
that
up
at
plas
newydd
there
had
been
a
terrible
business
over
swarming
the
bees
they
had
turned
as
wild
as
wasps
and
much
more
savage
they
had
come
about
the
people
who
were
taking
the
swarms
like
a
cloud
they
settled
on
one
face
so
that
you
could
not
see
the
flesh
for
the
bees
crawling
all
over
it
and
they
had
stung
him
so
badly
that
the
doctor
did
not
know
whether
he
would
get
over
it
and
they
had
chased
a
girl
who
had
come
out
to
see
the
swarming
and
settled
on
her
and
stung
her
to
death
then
they
had
gone
off
to
a
brake
below
the
farm
and
got
into
a
hollow
tree
there
and
it
was
not
safe
to
go
near
it
for
they
would
come
out
at
you
by
day
or
by
night
and
much
the
same
thing
had
happened
it
seemed
at
three
or
four
farms
and
cottages
where
bees
were
kept
and
there
were
stories
hardly
so
clear
or
so
credible
of
sheep
dogs
mild
and
trusted
beasts
turning
as
savage
as
wolves
and
injuring
the
farm
boys
in
a
horrible
one
case
it
was
said
with
fatal
results
it
was
certainly
true
that
old
favorite
cock
had
gone
mad
she
came
into
porth
one
saturday
morning
with
her
face
and
her
neck
all
bound
up
and
plastered
she
had
gone
out
to
her
bit
of
a
field
to
feed
the
poultry
the
night
before
and
the
bird
had
flown
at
her
and
attacked
her
most
savagely
inflicting
some
very
nasty
wounds
before
she
could
beat
it
off
was
a
stake
handy
lucky
for
me
she
said
i
did
beat
him
and
beat
him
till
the
life
was
out
of
him
but
what
is
come
to
the
world
whatever
now
remnant
the
man
of
theories
was
also
a
man
of
extreme
leisure
it
was
understood
that
he
had
succeeded
to
ample
means
when
he
was
quite
a
young
man
and
after
tasting
the
savors
of
the
law
as
it
were
for
half
a
dozen
terms
at
the
board
of
the
middle
temple
he
had
decided
that
it
would
be
senseless
to
bother
himself
with
passing
examinations
for
a
profession
which
he
had
not
the
faintest
intention
of
practising
so
he
turned
a
deaf
ear
to
the
call
of
ringing
through
the
temple
courts
and
set
himself
out
to
potter
amiably
through
the
world
he
had
pottered
all
over
europe
he
had
looked
at
africa
and
had
even
put
his
head
in
at
the
door
of
the
east
on
a
trip
which
included
the
greek
isles
and
constantinople
now
getting
into
the
middle
fifties
he
had
settled
at
porth
for
the
sake
as
he
said
of
the
gulf
stream
and
the
fuchsia
hedges
and
pottered
over
his
books
and
his
theories
and
the
local
gossip
he
was
no
more
brutal
than
the
general
public
which
revels
in
the
details
of
mysterious
crime
but
it
must
be
said
that
the
terror
black
though
it
was
was
a
boon
to
him
he
peered
and
investigated
and
poked
about
with
the
relish
of
a
man
to
whose
life
a
new
zest
has
been
added
he
listened
attentively
to
the
strange
tales
of
bees
and
dogs
and
poultry
that
came
into
porth
with
the
country
baskets
of
butter
rabbits
and
green
peas
and
he
evolved
at
last
a
most
extraordinary
theory
full
of
this
discovery
as
he
thought
it
he
went
one
night
to
see
lewis
and
take
his
view
of
the
matter
want
to
talk
to
you
said
remnant
to
the
doctor
what
i
have
called
provisionally
the
z
chapter
the
incident
of
the
unknown
tree
lewis
smiling
indulgently
and
quite
prepared
for
some
monstrous
piece
of
theorizing
led
remnant
into
the
room
that
overlooked
the
terraced
garden
and
the
sea
the
house
though
it
was
only
a
ten
walk
from
the
center
of
the
town
seemed
remote
from
all
other
habitations
the
drive
to
it
from
the
road
came
through
a
deep
grove
of
trees
and
a
dense
shrubbery
trees
were
about
the
house
on
either
side
mingling
with
neighboring
groves
and
below
the
garden
fell
down
terrace
by
green
terrace
to
wild
growth
a
twisted
path
amongst
red
rocks
and
at
last
to
the
yellow
sand
of
a
little
cove
the
room
to
which
the
doctor
took
remnant
looked
over
these
terraces
and
across
the
water
to
the
dim
boundaries
of
the
bay
it
had
french
windows
that
were
thrown
wide
open
and
the
two
men
sat
in
the
soft
light
of
the
was
before
the
days
of
severe
lighting
regulations
in
the
far
enjoyed
the
sweet
odors
and
the
sweet
vision
of
the
summer
evening
then
remnant
began
suppose
lewis
heard
these
extraordinary
stories
of
bees
and
dogs
and
things
that
have
been
going
about
lately
i
have
heard
them
i
was
called
in
at
plas
newydd
and
treated
thomas
trevor
only
just
out
of
danger
by
the
way
i
certified
for
the
poor
child
mary
trevor
she
was
dying
when
i
got
to
the
place
there
was
no
doubt
she
was
stung
to
death
by
bees
and
i
believe
there
were
other
very
similar
cases
at
llantarnam
and
morwen
none
fatal
i
think
what
about
them
then
there
are
the
stories
of
old
sheepdogs
turning
wicked
and
children
so
i
seen
any
of
these
cases
professionally
but
i
believe
the
stories
are
accurate
the
old
woman
assaulted
by
her
own
poultry
perfectly
true
her
daughter
put
some
stuff
of
their
own
concoction
on
her
face
and
neck
and
then
she
came
to
me
the
wounds
seemed
going
all
right
so
i
told
her
to
continue
the
treatment
whatever
it
might
good
said
mr
remnant
he
spoke
now
with
an
italic
impressiveness
you
see
the
link
between
all
this
and
the
horrible
things
that
have
been
happening
about
here
for
the
last
month
lewis
stared
at
remnant
in
amazement
he
lifted
his
red
eyebrows
and
lowered
them
in
a
kind
of
scowl
his
speech
showed
traces
of
his
native
accent
burning
he
exclaimed
on
earth
are
you
getting
at
now
it
is
madness
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
that
you
think
there
is
some
connection
between
a
swarm
or
two
of
bees
that
have
turned
nasty
a
cross
dog
and
a
wicked
old
cock
and
these
poor
people
that
have
been
pitched
over
the
cliffs
and
hammered
to
death
on
the
road
no
sense
in
it
you
am
strongly
inclined
to
believe
that
there
is
a
great
deal
of
sense
in
it
replied
remnant
with
extreme
calmness
here
lewis
i
saw
you
grinning
the
other
day
at
the
club
when
i
was
telling
the
fellows
that
in
my
opinion
all
these
outrages
had
been
committed
certainly
by
the
germans
but
by
some
method
of
which
we
have
no
conception
but
what
i
meant
to
say
when
i
talked
about
inconceivables
was
just
this
that
the
and
the
rest
of
them
have
been
killed
in
some
way
not
in
theory
at
all
not
in
our
theory
at
all
events
some
way
not
contemplated
not
thought
of
for
an
instant
do
you
see
my
point
in
a
sort
of
way
you
mean
an
absolute
originality
in
the
method
i
suppose
that
is
so
but
what
next
remnant
seemed
to
hesitate
partly
from
a
sense
of
the
portentous
nature
of
what
he
was
about
to
say
partly
from
a
sort
of
to
part
with
so
profound
a
secret
he
said
will
allow
that
we
have
two
sets
of
phenomena
of
a
very
extraordinary
kind
occurring
at
the
same
time
you
think
that
only
reasonable
to
connect
the
two
sets
with
one
the
philosopher
of
tenterden
steeple
and
the
goodwin
sands
thought
certainly
said
lewis
what
is
the
connection
those
poor
folks
on
the
highway
stung
by
bees
or
worried
by
a
dog
and
horses
throw
people
over
cliffs
or
stifle
them
in
i
never
meant
to
suggest
anything
so
absurd
it
is
evident
to
me
that
in
all
these
cases
of
animals
turning
suddenly
savage
the
cause
has
been
terror
panic
fear
the
horses
that
went
charging
into
the
camp
were
mad
with
fright
we
know
and
i
say
that
in
the
other
instances
we
have
been
discussing
the
cause
was
the
same
the
creatures
were
exposed
to
an
infection
of
fear
and
a
frightened
beast
or
bird
or
insect
uses
its
weapons
whatever
they
may
be
if
for
example
there
had
been
anybody
with
those
horses
when
they
took
their
panic
they
would
have
lashed
out
at
him
with
their
i
dare
say
that
that
is
so
my
belief
is
that
the
germans
have
made
an
extraordinary
discovery
i
have
called
it
the
z
ray
you
know
that
the
ether
is
merely
an
hypothesis
we
have
to
suppose
that
there
to
account
for
the
passage
of
the
marconi
current
from
one
place
to
another
now
suppose
that
there
is
a
psychic
ether
as
well
as
a
material
ether
suppose
that
it
is
possible
to
direct
irresistible
impulses
across
this
medium
suppose
that
these
impulses
are
towards
murder
or
suicide
then
i
think
that
you
have
an
explanation
of
the
terrible
series
of
events
that
have
been
happening
in
meirion
for
the
last
few
weeks
and
it
is
quite
clear
to
my
mind
that
the
horses
and
the
other
creatures
have
been
exposed
to
this
z
ray
and
that
it
has
produced
on
them
the
effect
of
terror
with
ferocity
as
the
result
of
terror
now
what
do
you
say
to
that
telepathy
you
know
is
well
established
so
is
hypnotic
suggestion
you
have
only
to
look
in
the
to
see
that
and
suggestion
is
so
strong
in
some
cases
as
to
be
an
irresistible
imperative
now
you
feel
that
putting
telepathy
and
suggestion
together
as
it
were
you
have
more
than
the
elements
of
what
i
call
the
z
ray
i
feel
myself
that
i
have
more
to
go
on
in
making
my
hypothesis
than
the
inventor
of
the
steam
engine
had
in
making
his
hypothesis
when
he
saw
the
lid
of
the
kettle
bobbing
up
and
down
what
do
you
say
lewis
made
no
answer
he
was
watching
the
growth
of
a
new
unknown
tree
in
his
garden
the
doctor
made
no
answer
to
question
for
one
thing
remnant
was
profuse
in
his
has
been
rigidly
condensed
in
this
lewis
was
tired
of
the
sound
of
his
voice
for
another
thing
he
found
the
z
ray
theory
almost
too
extravagant
to
be
bearable
wild
enough
to
tear
patience
to
tatters
and
then
as
the
tedious
argument
continued
lewis
became
conscious
that
there
was
something
strange
about
the
night
it
was
a
dark
summer
night
the
moon
was
old
and
faint
above
the
head
across
the
bay
and
the
air
was
very
still
it
was
so
still
that
lewis
had
noted
that
not
a
leaf
stirred
on
the
very
tip
of
a
high
tree
that
stood
out
against
the
sky
and
yet
he
knew
that
he
was
listening
to
some
sound
that
he
could
not
determine
or
define
it
was
not
the
wind
in
the
leaves
it
was
not
the
gentle
wash
of
the
water
of
the
sea
against
the
rocks
that
latter
sound
he
could
distinguish
quite
easily
but
there
was
something
else
it
was
scarcely
a
sound
it
was
as
if
the
air
itself
trembled
and
fluttered
as
the
air
trembles
in
a
church
when
they
open
the
great
pedal
pipes
of
the
organ
the
doctor
listened
intently
it
was
not
an
illusion
the
sound
was
not
in
his
own
head
as
he
had
suspected
for
a
moment
but
for
the
life
of
him
he
could
not
make
out
whence
it
came
or
what
it
was
he
gazed
down
into
the
night
over
the
terraces
of
his
garden
now
sweet
with
the
scent
of
the
flowers
of
the
night
tried
to
peer
over
the
across
the
sea
towards
the
head
it
struck
him
suddenly
that
this
strange
fluttering
vibration
of
the
air
might
be
the
noise
of
a
distant
aeroplane
or
airship
there
was
not
the
usual
droning
hum
but
this
sound
might
be
caused
by
a
new
type
of
engine
a
new
type
of
engine
possibly
it
was
an
enemy
airship
their
range
it
had
been
said
was
getting
longer
and
lewis
was
just
going
to
call
attention
to
the
sound
to
its
possible
cause
and
to
the
possible
danger
that
might
be
hovering
over
them
when
he
saw
something
that
caught
his
breath
and
his
heart
with
wild
amazement
and
a
touch
of
terror
he
had
been
staring
upward
into
the
sky
and
about
to
speak
to
remnant
he
had
let
his
eyes
drop
for
an
instant
he
looked
down
towards
the
trees
in
the
garden
and
saw
with
utter
astonishment
that
one
had
changed
its
shape
in
the
few
hours
that
had
passed
since
the
setting
of
the
sun
there
was
a
thick
grove
of
ilexes
bordering
the
lowest
terrace
and
above
them
rose
one
tall
pine
spreading
its
head
of
sparse
dark
branches
dark
against
the
sky
as
lewis
glanced
down
over
the
terraces
he
saw
that
the
tall
pine
tree
was
no
longer
there
in
its
place
there
rose
above
the
ilexes
what
might
have
been
a
greater
ilex
there
was
the
blackness
of
a
dense
growth
of
foliage
rising
like
a
broad
and
and
rounded
cloud
over
the
lesser
trees
here
then
was
a
sight
wholly
incredible
impossible
it
is
doubtful
whether
the
process
of
the
human
mind
in
such
a
case
has
ever
been
analyzed
and
registered
it
is
doubtful
whether
it
ever
can
be
registered
it
is
hardly
fair
to
bring
in
the
mathematician
since
he
deals
with
absolute
truth
so
far
as
mortality
can
conceive
absolute
truth
but
how
would
a
mathematician
feel
if
he
were
suddenly
confronted
with
a
triangle
i
suppose
he
would
instantly
become
a
raging
madman
and
lewis
staring
and
at
a
dark
and
spreading
tree
which
his
own
experience
informed
him
was
not
there
felt
for
an
instant
that
shock
which
should
affront
us
all
when
we
first
realize
the
intolerable
antinomy
of
achilles
and
the
tortoise
common
sense
tells
us
that
achilles
will
flash
past
the
tortoise
almost
with
the
speed
of
the
lightning
the
inflexible
truth
of
mathematics
assures
us
that
till
the
earth
boils
and
the
heavens
cease
to
endure
the
tortoise
must
still
be
in
advance
and
thereupon
we
should
in
common
decency
go
mad
we
do
not
go
mad
because
by
special
grace
we
are
certified
that
in
the
final
court
of
appeal
all
science
is
a
lie
even
the
highest
science
of
all
and
so
we
simply
grin
at
achilles
and
the
tortoise
as
we
grin
at
darwin
deride
huxley
and
laugh
at
herbert
spencer
lewis
did
not
grin
he
glared
into
the
dimness
of
the
night
at
the
great
spreading
tree
that
he
knew
could
not
be
there
and
as
he
gazed
he
saw
that
what
at
first
appeared
the
dense
blackness
of
foliage
was
fretted
and
starred
with
wonderful
appearances
of
lights
and
colors
afterwards
he
said
to
me
remember
thinking
to
myself
here
i
am
not
delirious
my
temperature
is
perfectly
normal
i
am
not
drunk
i
only
had
a
pint
of
graves
with
my
dinner
over
three
hours
ago
i
have
not
eaten
any
poisonous
fungus
i
have
not
taken
experimentally
so
now
then
what
is
happening
the
night
had
gloomed
over
clouds
obscured
the
faint
moon
and
the
misty
stars
lewis
rose
with
some
kind
of
warning
and
inhibiting
gesture
to
remnant
who
he
was
conscious
was
gaping
at
him
in
astonishment
he
walked
to
the
open
french
window
and
took
a
pace
forward
on
to
the
path
outside
and
looked
very
intently
at
the
dark
shape
of
the
tree
down
below
the
sloping
garden
above
the
washing
of
the
waves
he
shaded
the
light
of
the
lamp
behind
him
by
holding
his
hands
on
each
side
of
his
eyes
the
mass
of
the
tree
that
be
out
against
the
sky
but
not
so
clearly
now
that
the
clouds
had
rolled
up
its
edges
the
limits
of
its
leafage
were
not
so
distinct
lewis
thought
that
he
could
detect
some
sort
of
quivering
movement
in
it
though
the
air
was
at
a
dead
calm
it
was
a
night
on
which
one
might
hold
up
a
lighted
match
and
watch
it
burn
without
any
wavering
or
inclination
of
the
flame
know
said
lewis
a
bit
of
burnt
paper
will
sometimes
hang
over
the
coals
before
it
goes
up
the
chimney
and
little
worms
of
fire
will
shoot
through
it
it
was
like
that
if
you
should
be
standing
some
distance
away
just
threads
and
hairs
of
yellow
light
i
saw
and
specks
and
sparks
of
fire
and
then
a
twinkling
of
a
ruby
no
bigger
than
a
pin
point
and
a
green
wandering
in
the
black
as
if
an
emerald
were
crawling
and
then
little
veins
of
deep
blue
is
me
i
said
to
myself
in
welsh
is
all
this
color
and
burning
then
at
that
very
moment
there
came
a
thundering
rap
at
the
door
of
the
room
inside
and
there
was
my
man
telling
me
that
i
was
wanted
directly
up
at
the
garth
as
old
trevor
williams
had
been
taken
very
bad
i
knew
his
heart
was
not
worth
much
so
i
had
to
go
off
directly
and
leave
remnant
to
make
what
he
could
of
it
chapter
vi
z
ray
lewis
was
kept
some
time
at
the
garth
it
was
past
twelve
when
he
got
back
to
his
house
he
went
quickly
to
the
room
that
overlooked
the
garden
and
the
sea
and
threw
open
the
french
window
and
peered
into
the
darkness
there
dim
indeed
against
the
dim
sky
but
unmistakable
was
the
tall
pine
with
its
sparse
branches
high
above
the
dense
growth
of
the
ilex
trees
the
strange
boughs
which
had
amazed
him
had
vanished
there
was
no
appearance
now
of
colors
or
of
fires
he
drew
his
chair
up
to
the
open
window
and
sat
there
gazing
and
wondering
far
into
the
night
till
brightness
came
upon
the
sea
and
sky
and
the
forms
of
the
trees
in
the
garden
grew
clear
and
evident
he
went
up
to
his
bed
at
last
filled
with
a
great
perplexity
still
asking
questions
to
which
there
was
no
answer
the
doctor
did
not
say
anything
about
the
strange
tree
to
remnant
when
they
next
met
lewis
said
that
he
had
thought
there
was
a
man
hiding
amongst
the
in
explanation
of
that
warning
gesture
he
had
used
and
of
his
going
out
into
the
garden
and
staring
into
the
night
he
concealed
the
truth
because
he
dreaded
the
remnant
doctrine
that
would
undoubtedly
be
produced
indeed
he
hoped
that
he
had
heard
the
last
of
the
theory
of
the
z
ray
but
remnant
firmly
reopened
this
subject
were
interrupted
just
as
i
was
putting
my
case
to
you
he
said
to
sum
it
all
up
it
amounts
to
this
that
the
huns
have
made
one
of
the
great
leaps
of
science
they
are
sending
which
amount
to
irresistible
commands
over
here
and
the
persons
affected
are
seized
with
suicidal
or
homicidal
mania
the
people
who
were
killed
by
falling
over
the
cliffs
or
into
the
quarry
probably
committed
suicide
and
so
with
the
man
and
boy
who
were
found
in
the
bog
as
to
the
highway
case
you
remember
that
thomas
evans
said
that
he
stopped
and
talked
to
williams
on
the
night
of
the
murder
in
my
opinion
evans
was
the
murderer
he
came
under
the
influence
of
the
ray
became
a
homicidal
maniac
in
an
instant
snatched
spade
from
his
hand
and
killed
him
and
the
bodies
were
found
by
me
on
the
is
possible
that
the
first
impact
of
the
ray
produces
violent
nervous
excitement
which
would
manifest
itself
externally
williams
might
have
called
to
his
wife
to
come
and
see
what
was
the
matter
with
evans
the
children
would
naturally
follow
their
mother
it
seems
to
me
simple
and
as
for
the
horses
dogs
and
so
forth
they
as
i
say
were
no
doubt
panic
stricken
by
the
ray
and
hence
driven
to
should
evans
have
murdered
williams
instead
of
williams
murdering
evans
why
should
the
impact
of
the
ray
affect
one
and
not
the
other
does
one
man
react
violently
to
a
certain
drug
while
it
makes
no
impression
on
another
man
why
is
a
able
to
drink
a
bottle
of
whisky
and
remain
sober
while
b
is
turned
into
something
very
like
a
lunatic
after
he
has
drunk
three
glasses
is
a
question
of
idiosyncrasy
said
the
doctor
idiosyncrasy
greek
for
asked
remnant
at
all
said
lewis
smiling
blandly
mean
that
in
some
diatheses
you
have
mentioned
not
to
be
pathogenic
or
at
all
events
not
immediately
pathogenic
in
other
cases
as
you
very
justly
observed
there
seems
to
be
a
very
marked
cachexia
associated
with
the
exhibition
of
the
spirit
in
question
even
in
comparatively
small
under
this
cloud
of
professional
verbiage
lewis
escaped
from
the
club
and
from
remnant
he
did
not
want
to
hear
any
more
about
that
dreadful
ray
because
he
felt
sure
that
the
ray
was
all
nonsense
but
asking
himself
why
he
felt
this
certitude
in
the
matter
he
had
to
confess
that
he
know
an
aeroplane
he
reflected
was
all
nonsense
before
it
was
made
and
he
remembered
talking
in
the
early
nineties
to
a
friend
of
his
about
the
newly
discovered
x
rays
the
friend
laughed
incredulously
evidently
believe
a
word
of
it
till
lewis
told
him
that
there
was
an
article
on
the
subject
in
the
current
number
of
the
whereupon
the
unbeliever
said
is
that
so
oh
really
i
and
was
converted
on
the
x
ray
faith
on
the
spot
lewis
remembering
this
talk
marveled
at
the
strange
processes
of
the
human
mind
its
illogical
and
yet
and
wondered
whether
he
himself
was
only
waiting
for
an
article
on
the
z
ray
in
the
to
become
a
devout
believer
in
the
doctrine
of
remnant
but
he
wondered
with
far
more
fervor
as
to
the
extraordinary
thing
he
had
seen
in
his
own
garden
with
his
own
eyes
the
tree
that
changed
all
its
shape
for
an
hour
or
two
of
the
night
the
growth
of
strange
boughs
the
apparition
of
secret
fires
among
them
the
sparkling
of
emerald
and
ruby
lights
how
could
one
fail
to
be
afraid
with
great
amazement
at
the
thought
of
such
a
mystery
thoughts
were
distracted
from
the
incredible
adventure
of
the
tree
by
the
visit
of
his
sister
and
her
husband
and
merritt
lived
in
a
manufacturing
town
of
the
midlands
which
was
now
of
course
a
center
of
munition
work
on
the
day
of
their
arrival
at
porth
merritt
who
was
tired
after
the
long
hot
journey
went
to
bed
early
and
merritt
and
lewis
went
into
the
room
by
the
garden
for
their
talk
and
tobacco
they
spoke
of
the
year
that
had
passed
since
their
last
meeting
of
the
weary
dragging
of
the
war
of
friends
that
had
perished
in
it
of
the
hopelessness
of
an
early
ending
of
all
this
misery
lewis
said
nothing
of
the
terror
that
was
on
the
land
one
does
not
greet
a
tired
man
who
is
come
to
a
quiet
sunny
place
for
relief
from
black
smoke
and
work
and
worry
with
a
tale
of
horror
indeed
the
doctor
saw
that
his
looked
far
from
well
and
he
seemed
there
was
an
occasional
twitch
of
his
mouth
that
lewis
did
not
like
at
all
said
the
doctor
after
an
interval
of
silence
and
port
wine
am
glad
to
see
you
here
again
porth
always
suits
you
i
think
looking
quite
up
to
your
usual
form
but
three
weeks
of
meirion
air
will
do
i
hope
it
will
said
the
other
am
not
up
to
the
mark
things
are
not
going
well
at
is
all
right
it
business
is
all
right
but
there
are
other
things
that
are
all
wrong
we
are
living
under
a
reign
of
terror
it
comes
to
on
earth
do
you
mean
i
suppose
i
may
tell
you
what
i
know
not
much
i
dare
write
it
but
do
you
know
that
at
every
one
of
the
munition
works
in
midlingham
and
all
about
it
a
guard
of
soldiers
with
drawn
bayonets
and
loaded
rifles
day
and
night
men
with
bombs
too
and
at
the
big
spies
want
lewis
guns
to
fight
spies
with
nor
bombs
nor
a
platoon
of
men
i
woke
up
last
night
it
was
the
at
army
motor
works
firing
like
fury
and
then
bang
bang
bang
that
was
the
hand
what
against
knows
what
is
happening
merritt
repeated
and
he
went
on
to
describe
the
bewilderment
and
terror
that
hung
like
a
cloud
over
the
great
industrial
city
in
the
midlands
how
the
feeling
of
concealment
of
some
intolerable
secret
danger
that
must
not
be
named
was
worst
of
all
young
fellow
i
know
he
said
on
short
leave
the
other
day
from
the
front
and
he
spent
it
with
his
people
at
about
four
miles
out
of
midlingham
you
know
god
he
said
to
me
am
going
back
no
good
saying
that
the
wipers
salient
is
nice
because
it
but
a
damned
sight
better
than
this
at
the
front
you
know
what
up
against
at
midlingham
everybody
has
the
feeling
that
up
against
something
awful
and
we
know
what
that
that
makes
people
inclined
to
whisper
terror
in
the
merritt
made
a
sort
of
picture
of
the
great
town
cowering
in
its
fear
of
an
unknown
danger
are
afraid
to
go
about
alone
at
nights
in
the
outskirts
they
make
up
parties
at
the
stations
to
go
home
together
if
anything
like
dark
or
if
there
are
any
lonely
bits
on
their
why
i
understand
what
are
they
afraid
of
i
told
you
about
my
being
awakened
up
the
other
night
with
the
at
the
motor
works
rattling
away
and
the
bombs
exploding
and
making
the
most
terrible
noise
that
sort
of
thing
alarms
one
you
know
only
it
must
be
very
terrifying
you
mean
then
there
is
a
general
nervousness
about
a
vague
sort
of
apprehension
that
makes
people
inclined
to
herd
together
that
and
more
people
have
gone
out
that
have
never
come
back
there
were
a
couple
of
men
in
the
train
to
holme
arguing
about
the
quickest
way
to
get
to
northend
a
sort
of
outlying
part
of
holme
where
they
both
lived
they
argued
all
the
way
out
of
midlingham
one
saying
that
the
high
road
was
the
quickest
though
it
was
the
longest
way
the
quickest
going
because
the
cleanest
going
he
other
chap
fancied
a
short
cut
across
the
fields
by
the
canal
half
the
distance
he
kept
on
if
you
lose
your
way
said
the
other
well
it
appears
they
put
an
even
on
it
and
each
was
to
try
his
own
way
when
they
got
out
of
the
train
it
was
arranged
that
they
were
to
meet
at
the
in
northend
shall
be
at
the
first
said
the
man
who
believed
in
the
short
cut
and
with
that
he
climbed
over
the
stile
and
made
off
across
the
fields
it
late
enough
to
be
really
dark
and
a
lot
of
them
thought
he
might
win
the
stakes
but
he
never
turned
up
at
the
anywhere
else
for
the
matter
of
happened
to
him
was
found
lying
on
his
back
in
the
middle
of
a
way
from
the
path
he
was
dead
the
doctors
said
been
suffocated
nobody
knows
how
then
there
have
been
other
cases
we
whisper
about
them
at
midlingham
but
afraid
to
speak
lewis
was
ruminating
all
this
profoundly
terror
in
meirion
and
terror
far
away
in
the
heart
of
england
but
at
midlingham
so
far
as
he
could
gather
from
these
stories
of
soldiers
on
guard
of
crackling
it
was
a
case
of
an
organized
attack
on
the
munitioning
of
the
army
he
felt
that
he
did
not
know
enough
to
warrant
his
deciding
that
the
terror
of
meirion
and
of
stratfordshire
were
one
then
merritt
began
again
a
queer
story
going
about
when
the
shut
and
the
drawn
that
is
as
to
a
place
right
out
in
the
country
over
the
other
side
of
midlingham
on
the
opposite
side
to
dunwich
built
one
of
the
new
factories
out
there
a
great
red
brick
town
of
sheds
they
tell
me
it
is
with
a
tremendous
chimney
not
been
finished
more
than
a
month
or
six
weeks
they
plumped
it
down
right
in
the
middle
of
the
fields
by
the
line
and
building
huts
for
the
workers
as
fast
as
they
can
but
up
to
the
present
the
men
are
billeted
all
about
up
and
down
the
line
two
hundred
yards
from
this
place
an
old
footpath
leading
from
the
station
and
the
main
road
up
to
a
small
hamlet
on
the
hillside
part
of
the
way
this
path
goes
by
a
pretty
large
wood
most
of
it
thick
undergrowth
i
should
think
there
must
be
twenty
acres
of
wood
more
or
less
as
it
happens
i
used
this
path
once
long
ago
and
i
can
tell
you
a
black
place
of
nights
man
had
to
go
this
way
one
night
he
got
along
all
right
till
he
came
to
the
wood
and
then
he
said
his
heart
dropped
out
of
his
body
it
was
awful
to
hear
the
noises
in
that
wood
thousands
of
men
were
in
it
he
swears
that
it
was
full
of
rustling
and
pattering
of
feet
trying
to
go
dainty
and
the
crack
of
dead
boughs
lying
on
the
ground
as
some
one
trod
on
them
and
swishing
of
the
grass
and
some
sort
of
chattering
speech
going
on
that
sounded
so
he
said
as
if
the
dead
sat
in
their
bones
and
talked
he
ran
for
his
life
anyhow
across
fields
over
hedges
through
brooks
he
must
have
run
by
his
tale
ten
miles
out
of
his
way
before
he
got
home
to
his
wife
and
beat
at
the
door
and
broke
in
and
bolted
it
behind
is
something
rather
alarming
about
any
wood
at
night
said
lewis
merritt
shrugged
his
shoulders
say
that
the
germans
have
landed
and
that
they
are
hiding
in
underground
places
all
over
the
chapter
vii
the
case
of
the
hidden
germans
lewis
gasped
for
a
moment
silent
in
contemplation
of
the
magnificence
of
rumor
the
germans
already
landed
hiding
underground
striking
by
night
secretly
terribly
at
the
power
of
england
here
was
a
conception
which
made
the
myth
of
a
paltry
fable
before
which
the
legend
of
mons
was
an
ineffectual
thing
it
was
monstrous
and
he
looked
steadily
at
merritt
a
solid
sort
of
man
he
had
symptoms
of
nerves
about
him
for
the
moment
certainly
but
one
could
not
wonder
at
that
whether
the
tales
he
told
were
true
or
whether
he
merely
believed
them
to
be
true
lewis
had
known
his
for
twenty
years
or
more
and
had
always
found
him
a
sure
man
in
his
own
small
world
then
said
the
doctor
to
himself
men
if
they
once
get
out
of
the
ring
of
that
little
world
of
theirs
they
are
lost
those
are
the
men
that
believed
in
madame
he
said
do
you
think
yourself
the
germans
landed
and
hiding
somewhere
about
the
country
something
extravagant
in
the
notion
there
know
what
to
think
you
get
over
the
facts
there
are
the
soldiers
with
their
rifles
and
their
guns
at
the
works
all
over
stratfordshire
and
those
guns
go
off
i
told
you
heard
them
then
who
are
the
soldiers
shooting
at
what
we
ask
ourselves
at
so
i
quite
understand
an
extraordinary
state
of
more
than
extraordinary
an
awful
state
of
things
terror
in
the
dark
and
nothing
worse
than
that
as
that
young
fellow
i
was
telling
you
about
said
the
front
you
do
know
what
up
people
really
believe
that
a
number
of
germans
have
somehow
got
over
to
england
and
have
hid
themselves
underground
say
got
a
new
kind
of
some
think
that
they
dig
underground
places
and
make
the
gas
there
and
lead
it
by
secret
pipes
into
the
shops
others
say
that
they
throw
gas
bombs
into
the
factories
it
must
be
worse
than
anything
used
in
france
from
what
the
authorities
authorities
do
admit
that
there
are
germans
in
hiding
about
midlingham
they
call
it
but
we
know
it
explosions
we
know
in
the
midlands
what
an
explosion
sounds
like
and
looks
like
and
we
know
that
the
people
killed
in
these
are
put
into
their
coffins
in
the
works
their
own
relations
are
not
allowed
to
see
so
you
believe
in
the
german
theory
i
do
because
one
must
believe
in
something
some
say
seen
the
gas
i
heard
that
a
man
living
in
dunwich
saw
it
one
night
like
a
black
cloud
with
sparks
of
fire
in
it
floating
over
the
tops
of
the
trees
by
dunwich
the
light
of
an
ineffable
amazement
came
into
eyes
the
night
of
visit
the
trembling
vibration
of
the
air
the
dark
tree
that
had
grown
in
his
garden
since
the
setting
of
the
sun
the
strange
leafage
that
was
starred
with
burning
with
emerald
and
ruby
fires
and
all
vanished
away
when
he
returned
from
his
visit
to
the
garth
and
such
a
leafage
had
appeared
as
a
burning
cloud
far
in
the
heart
of
england
what
intolerable
mystery
what
tremendous
doom
was
signified
in
this
but
one
thing
was
clear
and
certain
that
the
terror
of
meirion
was
also
the
terror
of
the
midlands
lewis
made
up
his
mind
most
firmly
that
if
possible
all
this
should
be
kept
from
his
merritt
had
come
to
porth
as
to
a
city
of
refuge
from
the
horrors
of
midlingham
if
it
could
be
managed
he
should
be
spared
the
knowledge
that
the
cloud
of
terror
had
gone
before
him
and
hung
black
over
the
western
land
lewis
passed
the
port
and
said
in
an
even
voice
strange
indeed
a
black
cloud
with
sparks
of
fire
answer
for
it
you
know
only
a
so
and
you
think
or
inclined
to
think
that
this
and
all
the
rest
told
me
is
to
be
put
down
to
the
hidden
germans
i
say
because
one
must
think
quite
see
your
point
no
doubt
if
true
the
most
awful
blow
that
has
ever
been
dealt
at
any
nation
in
the
whole
history
of
man
the
enemy
established
in
our
vitals
but
is
it
possible
after
all
how
could
it
have
been
worked
merritt
told
lewis
how
it
had
been
worked
or
rather
how
people
said
it
had
been
worked
the
idea
he
said
was
that
this
was
a
part
and
a
most
important
part
of
the
great
german
plot
to
destroy
england
and
the
british
empire
the
scheme
had
been
prepared
years
ago
some
thought
soon
after
the
war
moltke
had
seen
that
the
invasion
of
england
in
the
ordinary
sense
of
the
term
invasion
presented
very
great
difficulties
the
matter
was
constantly
in
discussion
in
the
inner
military
and
high
political
circles
and
the
general
trend
of
opinion
in
these
quarters
was
that
at
the
best
the
invasion
of
england
would
involve
germany
in
the
gravest
difficulties
and
leave
france
in
the
position
of
the
this
was
the
state
of
affairs
when
a
very
high
prussian
personage
was
approached
by
the
swedish
professor
huvelius
thus
merritt
and
here
i
would
say
in
parenthesis
that
this
huvelius
was
by
all
accounts
an
extraordinary
man
considered
personally
and
apart
from
his
writings
he
would
appear
to
have
been
a
most
amiable
individual
he
was
richer
than
the
generality
of
swedes
certainly
far
richer
than
the
average
university
professor
in
sweden
but
his
shabby
green
and
his
battered
furry
hat
were
notorious
in
the
university
town
where
he
lived
no
one
laughed
because
it
was
well
known
that
professor
huvelius
spent
every
penny
of
his
private
means
and
a
large
portion
of
his
official
stipend
on
works
of
kindness
and
charity
he
hid
his
head
in
a
garret
some
one
said
in
order
that
others
might
be
able
to
swell
on
the
first
floor
it
was
told
of
him
that
he
restricted
himself
to
a
diet
of
dry
bread
and
coffee
for
a
month
in
order
that
a
poor
woman
of
the
streets
dying
of
consumption
might
enjoy
luxuries
in
hospital
and
this
was
the
man
who
wrote
the
treatise
facinore
to
prove
the
infinite
corruption
of
the
human
race
oddly
enough
professor
huvelius
wrote
the
most
cynical
book
in
the
preaches
rosy
sentimentalism
in
the
very
highest
motives
he
held
that
a
very
large
part
of
human
misery
misadventure
and
sorrow
was
due
to
the
false
convention
that
the
heart
of
man
was
naturally
and
in
the
main
well
disposed
and
kindly
if
not
exactly
righteous
thieves
assassins
violators
and
all
the
host
of
the
abominable
he
says
in
one
passage
created
by
the
false
pretense
and
foolish
credence
of
human
virtue
a
lion
in
a
cage
is
a
fierce
beast
indeed
but
what
will
he
be
if
we
declare
him
to
be
a
lamb
and
open
the
doors
of
his
den
who
will
be
guilty
of
the
deaths
of
the
men
women
and
children
whom
he
will
surely
devour
save
those
who
unlocked
the
cage
and
he
goes
on
to
show
that
kings
and
the
rulers
of
the
peoples
could
decrease
the
sum
of
human
misery
to
a
vast
extent
by
acting
on
the
doctrine
of
human
wickedness
he
declares
is
one
of
the
worst
of
evils
will
always
continue
to
exist
but
a
wise
king
will
desire
a
brief
war
rather
than
a
lengthy
one
a
short
evil
rather
than
a
long
evil
and
this
not
from
the
benignity
of
his
heart
towards
his
enemies
for
we
have
seen
that
the
human
heart
is
naturally
malignant
but
because
he
desires
to
conquer
and
to
conquer
easily
without
a
great
expenditure
of
men
or
of
treasure
knowing
that
if
he
can
accomplish
this
feat
his
people
will
love
him
and
his
crown
will
be
secure
so
he
will
wage
brief
victorious
wars
and
not
only
spare
his
own
nation
but
the
nation
of
the
enemy
since
in
a
short
war
the
loss
is
less
on
both
sides
than
in
a
long
war
and
so
from
evil
will
come
and
how
asks
huvelius
are
such
wars
to
be
waged
the
wise
prince
he
replies
will
begin
by
assuming
the
enemy
to
be
infinitely
corruptible
and
infinitely
stupid
since
stupidity
and
corruption
are
the
chief
characteristics
of
man
so
the
prince
will
make
himself
friends
in
the
very
councils
of
his
enemy
and
also
amongst
the
populace
bribing
the
wealthy
by
proffering
to
them
the
opportunity
of
still
greater
wealth
and
winning
the
poor
by
swelling
words
contrary
to
the
common
opinion
it
is
the
wealthy
who
are
greedy
of
wealth
while
the
populace
are
to
be
gained
by
talking
to
them
about
liberty
their
unknown
god
and
so
much
are
they
enchanted
by
the
words
liberty
freedom
and
such
like
that
the
wise
can
go
to
the
poor
rob
them
of
what
little
they
have
dismiss
them
with
a
hearty
kick
and
win
their
hearts
and
their
votes
for
ever
if
only
they
will
assure
them
that
the
treatment
which
they
have
received
is
called
guided
by
these
principles
says
huvelius
the
wise
prince
will
entrench
himself
in
the
country
that
he
desires
to
conquer
with
but
little
trouble
he
may
actually
and
literally
throw
his
garrisons
into
the
heart
of
the
enemy
country
before
war
has
this
is
a
long
and
tiresome
parenthesis
but
it
is
necessary
as
explaining
the
long
tale
which
merritt
told
his
he
having
received
it
from
some
magnate
of
the
midlands
who
had
traveled
in
germany
it
is
probable
that
the
story
was
suggested
in
the
first
place
by
the
passage
from
huvelius
which
i
have
just
quoted
merritt
knew
nothing
of
the
real
huvelius
who
was
all
but
a
saint
he
thought
of
the
swedish
professor
as
a
monster
of
iniquity
as
he
said
no
doubt
nietzsche
so
he
told
the
story
of
how
huvelius
had
sold
his
plan
to
the
germans
a
plan
for
filling
england
with
german
soldiers
land
was
to
be
bought
in
certain
suitable
and
places
englishmen
were
to
be
bought
as
the
apparent
owners
of
such
land
and
secret
excavations
were
to
be
made
till
the
country
was
literally
undermined
a
subterranean
germany
in
fact
was
to
be
dug
under
selected
districts
of
england
there
were
to
be
great
caverns
underground
cities
well
drained
well
ventilated
supplied
with
water
and
in
these
places
vast
stores
both
of
food
and
of
munitions
were
to
be
accumulated
year
after
year
till
dawned
and
then
warned
in
time
the
secret
garrison
would
leave
shops
hotels
offices
villas
and
vanish
underground
ready
to
begin
their
work
of
bleeding
england
at
the
heart
what
henson
told
me
said
merritt
at
the
end
of
his
long
story
head
of
the
buckley
iron
and
steel
syndicate
he
has
been
a
lot
in
said
lewis
course
it
may
be
so
if
it
is
so
it
is
terrible
beyond
indeed
he
found
something
horribly
plausible
in
the
story
it
was
an
extraordinary
plan
of
course
an
unheard
of
scheme
but
it
did
not
seem
impossible
it
was
the
trojan
horse
on
a
gigantic
scale
indeed
he
reflected
the
story
of
the
horse
with
the
warriors
concealed
within
it
which
was
dragged
into
the
heart
of
troy
by
the
deluded
trojans
themselves
might
be
taken
as
a
prophetic
parable
of
what
had
happened
to
theory
were
well
founded
and
this
theory
certainly
squared
with
what
one
had
heard
of
german
preparations
in
belgium
and
in
france
emplacements
for
guns
ready
for
the
invader
german
manufactories
which
were
really
german
forts
on
belgian
soil
the
caverns
by
the
aisne
made
ready
for
the
cannon
indeed
lewis
thought
he
remembered
something
about
suspicious
concrete
on
the
heights
commanding
london
but
a
german
army
hidden
under
english
ground
it
was
a
thought
to
chill
the
stoutest
heart
and
it
seemed
from
that
wonder
of
the
burning
tree
that
the
enemy
mysteriously
and
terribly
present
at
midlingham
was
present
also
in
meirion
lewis
thinking
of
the
country
as
he
knew
it
of
its
wild
and
desolate
hillsides
its
deep
woods
its
wastes
and
solitary
places
could
not
but
confess
that
no
more
fit
region
could
be
found
for
the
deadly
enterprise
of
secret
men
yet
he
thought
again
there
was
but
little
harm
to
be
done
in
meirion
to
the
armies
of
england
or
to
their
munitionment
they
were
working
for
panic
terror
possibly
that
might
be
so
but
the
camp
under
the
highway
that
should
be
their
first
object
and
no
harm
had
been
done
there
lewis
did
not
know
that
since
the
panic
of
the
horses
men
had
died
terribly
in
that
camp
that
it
was
now
a
fortified
place
with
a
deep
broad
trench
a
thick
tangle
of
savage
barbed
wire
about
it
and
a
planted
at
each
corner
chapter
viii
what
merritt
found
merritt
began
to
pick
up
his
health
and
spirits
a
good
deal
for
the
first
morning
or
two
of
his
stay
at
the
he
contented
himself
with
a
very
comfortable
deck
chair
close
to
the
house
where
he
sat
under
the
shade
of
an
old
mulberry
tree
beside
his
wife
and
watched
the
bright
sunshine
on
the
green
lawns
on
the
creamy
crests
of
the
waves
on
the
headlands
of
that
glorious
coast
purple
even
from
afar
with
the
imperial
glow
of
the
heather
on
the
white
farmhouses
gleaming
in
the
sunlight
high
over
the
sea
far
from
any
turmoil
from
any
troubling
of
men
the
sun
was
hot
but
the
wind
breathed
all
the
while
gently
incessantly
from
the
east
and
merritt
who
had
come
to
this
quiet
place
not
only
from
dismay
but
from
the
stifling
and
oily
airs
of
the
smoky
midland
town
said
that
that
east
wind
pure
and
clear
and
like
well
water
from
the
rock
was
new
life
to
him
he
ate
a
capital
dinner
at
the
end
of
his
first
day
at
porth
and
took
rosy
views
as
to
what
they
had
been
talking
about
the
night
before
he
said
to
lewis
no
doubt
there
must
be
trouble
of
some
sort
and
perhaps
bad
trouble
still
kitchener
would
soon
put
it
all
right
so
things
went
on
very
well
merritt
began
to
stroll
about
the
garden
which
was
full
of
the
comfortable
spaces
groves
and
surprises
that
only
country
gardens
know
to
the
right
of
one
of
the
terraces
he
found
an
arbor
or
covered
with
white
roses
and
he
was
as
pleased
as
if
he
had
discovered
the
pole
he
spent
a
whole
day
there
smoking
and
lounging
and
reading
a
rubbishy
sensational
story
and
declared
that
the
devonshire
roses
had
taken
many
years
off
his
age
then
on
the
other
side
of
the
garden
there
was
a
filbert
grove
that
he
had
never
explored
on
any
of
his
former
visits
and
again
there
was
a
find
deep
in
the
shadow
of
the
filberts
was
a
bubbling
well
issuing
from
rocks
and
all
manner
of
green
dewy
ferns
growing
about
it
and
above
it
and
an
angelica
springing
beside
it
merritt
knelt
on
his
knees
and
hollowed
his
hand
and
drank
the
well
water
he
said
over
his
port
that
night
that
if
all
water
were
like
the
water
of
the
filbert
well
the
world
would
turn
to
teetotalism
it
takes
a
townsman
to
relish
the
manifold
and
exquisite
joys
of
the
country
it
was
not
till
he
began
to
venture
abroad
that
merritt
found
that
something
was
lacking
of
the
old
rich
peace
that
used
to
dwell
in
meirion
he
had
a
favorite
walk
which
he
never
neglected
year
after
year
this
walk
led
along
the
cliffs
towards
meiros
and
then
one
could
turn
inland
and
return
to
porth
by
deep
winding
lanes
that
went
over
the
allt
so
merritt
set
out
early
one
morning
and
got
as
far
as
a
at
the
foot
of
the
path
that
led
up
to
the
cliff
there
was
a
sentry
pacing
up
and
down
in
front
of
the
box
and
he
called
on
merritt
to
produce
his
pass
or
to
turn
back
to
the
main
road
merritt
was
a
good
deal
put
out
and
asked
the
doctor
about
this
strict
guard
and
the
doctor
was
surprised
know
they
had
put
their
bar
up
there
he
said
suppose
wise
we
are
certainly
in
the
far
west
here
still
the
germans
might
slip
round
and
raid
us
and
do
a
lot
of
damage
just
because
meirion
is
the
last
place
we
should
expect
them
to
go
there
are
no
fortifications
surely
on
the
cliff
no
i
never
heard
of
anything
of
the
kind
the
point
of
forbidding
the
public
to
go
on
the
cliff
then
i
can
quite
understand
putting
a
sentry
on
the
top
to
keep
a
for
the
enemy
what
i
understand
is
a
sentry
at
the
bottom
who
keep
a
for
anything
as
he
see
the
sea
and
why
warn
the
public
off
the
cliffs
i
facilitate
a
german
landing
by
standing
on
pengareg
even
if
i
wanted
is
curious
the
doctor
agreed
military
reasons
i
he
let
the
matter
drop
perhaps
because
the
matter
did
not
affect
him
people
who
live
in
the
country
all
the
year
round
country
doctors
certainly
are
little
given
to
desultory
walking
in
search
of
the
picturesque
lewis
had
no
suspicion
that
sentries
whose
object
was
equally
obscure
were
being
dotted
all
over
the
country
there
was
a
sentry
for
example
by
the
quarry
at
llanfihangel
where
the
dead
woman
and
the
dead
sheep
had
been
found
some
weeks
before
the
path
by
the
quarry
was
used
a
good
deal
and
its
closing
would
have
inconvenienced
the
people
of
the
neighborhood
very
considerably
but
the
sentry
had
his
box
by
the
side
of
the
track
and
had
his
orders
to
keep
everybody
strictly
to
the
path
as
if
the
quarry
were
a
secret
fort
it
was
not
known
till
a
month
or
two
ago
that
one
of
these
sentries
was
himself
a
victim
of
the
terror
the
men
on
duty
at
this
place
were
given
certain
very
strict
orders
which
from
the
nature
of
the
case
must
have
seemed
to
them
unreasonable
for
old
soldiers
orders
are
orders
but
here
was
a
young
bank
clerk
scarcely
in
training
for
a
couple
of
months
who
had
not
begun
to
appreciate
the
necessity
of
hard
literal
obedience
to
an
order
which
seemed
to
him
meaningless
he
found
himself
on
a
remote
and
lonely
hillside
he
had
not
the
faintest
notion
that
his
every
movement
was
watched
and
he
disobeyed
a
certain
instruction
that
had
been
given
him
the
post
was
found
deserted
by
the
relief
the
dead
body
was
found
at
the
bottom
of
the
quarry
this
by
the
way
but
merritt
discovered
again
and
again
that
things
happened
to
hamper
his
walks
and
his
wanderings
two
or
three
miles
from
porth
there
is
a
great
marsh
made
by
the
afon
river
before
it
falls
into
the
sea
and
here
merritt
had
been
accustomed
to
botanize
mildly
he
had
learned
pretty
accurately
the
causeways
of
solid
ground
that
lead
through
the
sea
of
swamp
and
ooze
and
soft
yielding
soil
and
he
set
out
one
hot
afternoon
determined
to
make
a
thorough
exploration
of
the
marsh
and
this
time
to
find
that
rare
bog
bean
that
he
felt
sure
must
grow
somewhere
in
its
wide
extent
he
got
into
the
that
skirts
the
marsh
and
to
the
gate
which
he
had
always
used
for
entrance
there
was
the
scene
as
he
had
known
it
always
the
rich
growth
of
reeds
and
flags
and
rushes
the
mild
black
cattle
grazing
on
the
of
firm
turf
the
scented
procession
of
the
meadowsweet
the
royal
glory
of
the
loosestrife
flaming
pennons
crimson
and
golden
of
the
giant
dock
but
they
were
bringing
out
a
dead
body
through
the
gate
a
laboring
man
was
holding
open
the
gate
on
the
marsh
merritt
horrified
spoke
to
him
and
asked
who
it
was
and
how
it
had
happened
do
say
he
was
a
visitor
at
porth
somehow
he
has
been
drowned
in
the
marsh
perfectly
safe
been
all
over
it
a
dozen
indeed
we
did
always
think
so
if
you
did
slip
by
accident
like
and
fall
into
the
water
it
was
not
so
deep
it
was
easy
enough
to
climb
out
again
and
this
gentleman
was
quite
young
to
look
at
him
poor
man
and
he
has
come
to
meirion
for
his
pleasure
and
holiday
and
found
his
death
in
it
he
do
it
on
purpose
is
it
suicide
say
he
had
no
reasons
to
do
here
the
sergeant
of
police
in
charge
of
the
party
interposed
according
to
orders
which
he
himself
did
not
understand
terrible
thing
sir
to
be
sure
and
a
sad
pity
and
i
am
sure
this
is
not
the
sort
of
sight
you
have
come
to
see
down
in
meirion
this
beautiful
summer
so
you
think
sir
that
it
would
be
more
pleasant
like
if
you
would
leave
us
to
this
sad
business
of
ours
i
have
heard
many
gentlemen
staying
in
porth
say
that
there
is
nothing
to
beat
the
view
from
the
hill
over
there
not
in
the
whole
of
every
one
is
polite
in
meirion
but
somehow
merritt
understood
that
in
english
this
speech
meant
merritt
moved
back
to
was
not
in
the
humor
for
any
idle
pleasurable
strolling
after
so
dreadful
a
meeting
with
death
he
made
some
inquiries
in
the
town
about
the
dead
man
but
nothing
seemed
known
of
him
it
was
said
that
he
had
been
on
his
honeymoon
that
he
had
been
staying
at
the
porth
castle
hotel
but
the
people
of
the
hotel
declared
that
they
had
never
heard
of
such
a
person
merritt
got
the
local
paper
at
the
end
of
the
week
there
was
not
a
word
in
it
of
any
fatal
accident
in
the
marsh
he
met
the
sergeant
of
police
in
the
street
that
officer
touched
his
helmet
with
the
utmost
politeness
and
a
you
are
enjoying
yourself
sir
indeed
you
do
look
a
lot
better
but
as
to
the
poor
man
who
was
found
drowned
or
stifled
in
the
marsh
he
knew
nothing
the
next
day
merritt
made
up
his
mind
to
go
to
the
marsh
to
see
whether
he
could
find
anything
to
account
for
so
strange
a
death
what
he
found
was
a
man
with
an
armlet
standing
by
the
gate
the
armlet
had
the
letters
on
it
which
are
understood
to
mean
coast
watcher
the
watcher
said
he
had
strict
instructions
to
keep
everybody
away
from
the
marsh
why
he
know
but
some
said
that
the
river
was
changing
its
course
since
the
new
railway
embankment
was
built
and
the
marsh
had
become
dangerous
to
people
who
know
it
thoroughly
sir
he
added
is
part
of
my
orders
not
to
set
foot
on
the
other
side
of
that
gate
myself
not
for
one
of
a
merritt
glanced
over
the
gate
incredulously
the
marsh
looked
as
it
had
always
looked
there
was
plenty
of
sound
hard
ground
to
walk
on
he
could
see
the
track
that
he
used
to
follow
as
firm
as
ever
he
did
not
believe
in
the
story
of
the
changing
course
of
the
river
and
lewis
said
he
had
never
heard
of
anything
of
the
kind
but
merritt
had
put
the
question
in
the
middle
of
general
conversation
he
had
not
led
up
to
it
from
any
discussion
of
the
death
in
the
marsh
and
so
the
doctor
was
taken
unawares
if
he
had
known
of
the
connection
in
mind
between
the
alleged
changing
of
the
course
and
the
tragical
event
in
the
marsh
no
doubt
he
would
have
confirmed
the
official
explanation
he
was
above
all
things
anxious
to
prevent
his
sister
and
her
husband
from
finding
out
that
the
invisible
hand
of
terror
that
ruled
at
midlingham
was
ruling
also
in
meirion
lewis
himself
had
little
doubt
that
the
man
who
was
found
dead
in
the
marsh
had
been
struck
down
by
the
secret
agency
whatever
it
was
that
had
already
accomplished
so
much
of
evil
but
it
was
a
chief
part
of
the
terror
that
no
one
knew
for
certain
that
this
or
that
particular
event
was
to
be
ascribed
to
it
people
do
occasionally
fall
over
cliffs
through
their
own
carelessness
and
as
the
case
of
garcia
the
spanish
sailor
showed
cottagers
and
their
wives
and
children
are
now
and
then
the
victims
of
savage
and
purposeless
violence
lewis
had
never
wandered
about
the
marsh
himself
but
remnant
had
pottered
round
it
and
about
it
and
declared
that
the
man
who
met
his
death
name
was
never
known
in
porth
at
all
either
have
committed
suicide
by
deliberately
lying
prone
in
the
ooze
and
stifling
himself
or
else
must
have
been
held
down
in
it
there
were
no
details
available
so
it
was
clear
that
the
authorities
had
classified
this
death
with
the
others
still
the
man
might
have
committed
suicide
or
he
might
have
had
a
sudden
seizure
and
fallen
in
the
slimy
water
and
so
on
it
was
possible
to
believe
that
case
a
b
c
was
in
the
category
of
ordinary
accidents
or
ordinary
crimes
but
it
was
not
possible
to
believe
that
a
b
c
were
all
in
that
category
and
thus
it
was
to
the
end
and
thus
it
is
now
we
know
that
the
terror
reigned
and
how
it
reigned
but
there
were
many
dreadful
events
ascribed
to
its
rule
about
which
there
must
always
be
room
for
doubt
for
example
there
was
the
case
of
the
the
which
came
to
grief
in
so
strange
a
manner
almost
under
eyes
in
my
opinion
he
was
quite
wrong
in
associating
the
sorry
fate
of
the
boat
and
her
occupants
with
a
system
of
signaling
by
flashlights
which
he
detected
or
thought
that
he
detected
on
the
afternoon
in
which
the
was
capsized
i
believe
his
signaling
theory
to
be
all
nonsense
in
spite
of
the
naturalized
german
governess
who
was
lodging
with
her
employers
in
the
suspected
house
but
on
the
other
hand
there
is
no
doubt
in
my
own
mind
that
the
boat
was
overturned
and
those
in
it
drowned
by
the
work
of
the
terror
chapter
ix
the
light
on
the
water
let
it
be
noted
carefully
that
so
far
merritt
had
not
the
slightest
suspicion
that
the
terror
of
midlingham
was
quick
over
meirion
lewis
had
watched
and
shepherded
him
carefully
he
had
let
out
no
suspicion
of
what
had
happened
in
meirion
and
before
taking
his
to
the
club
he
had
passed
round
a
hint
among
the
members
he
did
not
tell
the
truth
about
here
again
is
a
point
of
interest
that
as
the
terror
deepened
the
general
public
cooperated
voluntarily
and
one
would
say
almost
subconsciously
with
the
authorities
in
concealing
what
they
knew
from
one
he
gave
out
a
desirable
portion
of
the
truth
that
his
was
not
by
any
means
up
to
the
mark
and
that
it
was
therefore
desirable
that
he
should
be
spared
the
knowledge
of
the
intolerable
and
tragic
mysteries
which
were
being
enacted
all
about
them
knows
about
that
poor
fellow
who
was
found
in
the
marsh
said
lewis
he
has
a
kind
of
vague
suspicion
that
there
is
something
out
of
the
common
about
the
case
but
no
more
than
clear
case
of
suggested
or
rather
commanded
suicide
said
remnant
regard
it
as
a
strong
confirmation
of
my
so
said
the
doctor
dreading
lest
he
might
have
to
hear
about
the
z
ray
all
over
again
please
let
anything
out
to
him
i
want
him
to
get
built
up
thoroughly
before
he
goes
back
to
then
on
the
other
hand
merritt
was
as
still
as
death
about
the
doings
of
the
midlands
he
hated
to
think
of
them
much
more
to
speak
of
them
and
thus
as
i
say
he
and
the
men
at
the
porth
club
kept
their
secrets
from
one
another
and
thus
from
the
beginning
to
the
end
of
the
terror
the
links
were
not
drawn
together
in
many
cases
no
doubt
a
and
b
met
every
day
and
talked
familiarly
it
may
be
confidentially
on
other
matters
of
all
sorts
each
having
in
his
possession
half
of
the
truth
which
he
concealed
from
the
other
so
the
two
halves
were
never
put
together
to
make
a
whole
merritt
as
the
doctor
guessed
had
a
kind
of
uneasy
scarcely
amounted
to
a
to
the
business
of
the
marsh
chiefly
because
he
thought
the
official
talk
about
the
railway
embankment
and
the
course
of
the
river
rank
nonsense
but
finding
that
nothing
more
happened
he
let
the
matter
drop
from
his
mind
and
settled
himself
down
to
enjoy
his
holiday
he
found
to
his
delight
that
there
were
no
sentries
or
watchers
to
hinder
him
from
the
approach
to
larnac
bay
a
delicious
cove
a
place
where
the
ashgrove
and
the
green
meadow
and
the
glistening
bracken
sloped
gently
down
to
red
rocks
and
firm
yellow
sands
merritt
remembered
a
rock
that
formed
a
comfortable
seat
and
here
he
established
himself
of
a
golden
afternoon
and
gazed
at
the
blue
of
the
sea
and
the
crimson
bastions
and
bays
of
the
coast
as
it
bent
inward
to
sarnau
and
swept
out
again
southward
to
the
promontory
called
the
head
merritt
gazed
on
amused
by
the
antics
of
the
porpoises
who
were
tumbling
and
splashing
and
gamboling
a
little
way
out
at
sea
charmed
by
the
pure
and
radiant
air
that
was
so
different
from
the
oily
smoke
that
often
stood
for
heaven
at
midlingham
and
charmed
too
by
the
white
farmhouses
dotted
here
and
there
on
the
heights
of
the
curving
coast
then
he
noticed
a
little
at
about
two
hundred
yards
from
the
shore
there
were
two
or
three
people
aboard
he
could
not
quite
make
out
how
many
and
they
seemed
to
be
doing
something
with
a
line
they
were
no
doubt
fishing
and
merritt
who
disliked
fish
wondered
how
people
could
spoil
such
an
afternoon
such
a
sea
such
pellucid
and
radiant
air
by
trying
to
catch
white
flabby
offensive
creatures
that
would
be
excessively
nasty
when
cooked
he
puzzled
over
this
problem
and
turned
away
from
it
to
the
contemplation
of
the
crimson
headlands
and
then
he
says
that
he
noticed
that
signaling
was
going
on
flashing
lights
of
intense
brilliance
he
declares
were
coming
from
one
of
those
farms
on
the
heights
of
the
coast
it
was
as
if
white
fire
was
spouting
from
it
merritt
was
certain
as
the
light
appeared
and
disappeared
that
some
message
was
being
sent
and
he
regretted
that
he
knew
nothing
of
heliography
three
short
flashes
a
long
and
very
brilliant
flash
then
two
short
flashes
merritt
fumbled
in
his
pocket
for
pencil
and
paper
so
that
he
might
record
these
signals
and
bringing
his
eyes
down
to
the
sea
level
he
became
aware
with
amazement
and
horror
that
the
boat
had
disappeared
all
that
he
could
see
was
some
vague
dark
object
far
to
westward
running
out
with
the
tide
now
it
is
certain
unfortunately
that
the
was
capsized
and
that
two
schoolboys
and
the
sailor
in
charge
were
drowned
the
bones
of
the
boat
were
found
amongst
the
rocks
far
along
the
coast
and
the
three
bodies
were
also
washed
ashore
the
sailor
could
not
swim
at
all
the
boys
only
a
little
and
it
needs
an
exceptionally
fine
swimmer
to
fight
against
the
outward
suck
of
the
tide
as
it
rushes
past
pengareg
point
but
i
have
no
belief
whatever
in
theory
he
held
and
still
holds
for
all
i
know
that
the
flashes
of
light
which
he
saw
coming
from
penyrhaul
the
farmhouse
on
the
height
had
some
connection
with
the
disaster
to
the
when
it
was
ascertained
that
a
family
were
spending
their
summer
at
the
farm
and
that
the
governess
was
a
german
though
a
long
naturalized
german
merritt
could
not
see
that
there
was
anything
left
to
argue
about
though
there
might
be
many
details
to
discover
but
in
my
opinion
all
this
was
a
mere
nest
the
flashes
of
brilliant
light
were
caused
no
doubt
by
the
sun
lighting
up
one
window
of
the
farmhouse
after
the
other
still
merritt
was
convinced
from
the
very
first
even
before
the
damning
circumstance
of
the
german
governess
was
brought
to
light
and
on
the
evening
of
the
disaster
as
lewis
and
he
sat
together
after
dinner
he
was
endeavoring
to
put
what
he
called
the
common
sense
of
the
matter
to
the
doctor
you
hear
a
shot
said
merritt
you
see
a
man
fall
you
know
pretty
well
what
killed
there
was
a
flutter
of
wild
wings
in
the
room
a
great
moth
beat
to
and
fro
and
dashed
itself
madly
against
the
ceiling
the
walls
the
glass
bookcase
then
a
sputtering
sound
a
momentary
dimming
of
the
lamp
the
moth
had
succeeded
in
its
mysterious
quest
you
tell
me
said
lewis
as
if
he
were
answering
merritt
moths
rush
into
the
flame
lewis
had
put
his
question
as
to
the
strange
habits
of
the
common
moth
to
merritt
with
the
deliberate
intent
of
closing
the
debate
on
death
by
heliograph
the
query
was
suggested
of
course
by
the
incident
of
the
moth
in
the
lamp
and
lewis
thought
that
he
had
said
shut
up
in
a
somewhat
elegant
manner
and
in
fact
merritt
looked
dignified
remained
silent
and
helped
himself
to
port
that
was
the
end
that
the
doctor
had
desired
he
had
no
doubt
in
his
own
mind
that
the
affair
of
the
was
but
one
more
item
in
the
long
account
of
horrors
that
grew
larger
almost
with
every
day
and
he
was
in
no
humor
to
listen
to
wild
and
futile
theories
as
to
the
manner
in
which
the
disaster
had
been
accomplished
here
was
a
proof
that
the
terror
that
was
upon
them
was
mighty
not
only
on
the
land
but
on
the
waters
for
lewis
could
not
see
that
the
boat
could
have
been
attacked
by
any
ordinary
means
of
destruction
from
story
it
must
have
been
in
shallow
water
the
shore
of
larnac
bay
shelves
very
gradually
and
the
admiralty
charts
showed
the
depth
of
water
two
hundred
yards
out
to
be
only
two
fathoms
this
would
be
too
shallow
for
a
submarine
and
it
could
not
have
been
shelled
and
it
could
not
have
been
torpedoed
there
was
no
explosion
the
disaster
might
have
been
due
to
carelessness
boys
he
considered
will
play
the
fool
anywhere
even
in
a
boat
but
he
did
not
think
so
the
sailor
would
have
stopped
them
and
it
may
be
mentioned
that
the
two
boys
were
as
a
matter
of
fact
extremely
steady
sensible
young
fellows
not
in
the
least
likely
to
play
foolish
tricks
of
any
kind
lewis
was
immersed
in
these
reflections
having
successfully
silenced
his
he
was
trying
in
vain
to
find
some
clue
to
the
horrible
enigma
the
midlingham
theory
of
a
concealed
german
force
hiding
in
places
under
the
earth
was
extravagant
enough
and
yet
it
seemed
the
only
solution
that
approached
plausibility
but
then
again
even
a
subterranean
german
host
would
hardly
account
for
this
wreckage
of
a
boat
floating
on
a
calm
sea
and
then
what
of
the
tree
with
the
burning
in
it
that
had
appeared
in
the
garden
there
a
few
weeks
ago
and
the
cloud
with
a
burning
in
it
that
had
shown
over
the
trees
of
the
midland
village
i
think
i
have
already
written
something
of
the
probable
emotions
of
the
mathematician
confronted
suddenly
with
an
undoubted
triangle
i
said
if
i
remember
that
he
would
be
forced
in
decency
to
go
mad
and
i
believe
that
lewis
was
very
near
to
this
point
he
felt
himself
confronted
with
an
intolerable
problem
that
most
instantly
demanded
solution
and
yet
with
the
same
breath
as
it
were
denied
the
possibility
of
there
being
any
solution
people
were
being
killed
in
an
inscrutable
manner
by
some
inscrutable
means
day
after
day
and
one
asked
and
and
there
seemed
no
answer
in
the
midlands
where
every
kind
of
munitionment
was
manufactured
the
explanation
of
german
agency
was
plausible
and
even
if
the
subterranean
notion
was
to
be
rejected
as
savoring
altogether
too
much
of
the
fairytale
or
rather
of
the
sensational
romance
yet
it
was
possible
that
the
backbone
of
the
theory
was
true
the
germans
might
have
planted
their
agents
in
some
way
or
another
in
the
midst
of
our
factories
but
here
in
meirion
what
serious
effect
could
be
produced
by
the
casual
and
indiscriminate
slaughter
of
a
couple
of
schoolboys
in
a
boat
of
a
harmless
in
a
marsh
the
creation
of
an
atmosphere
of
terror
and
dismay
it
was
possible
of
course
but
it
hardly
seemed
tolerable
in
spite
of
the
enormities
of
louvain
and
of
the
into
these
meditations
and
into
the
still
dignified
silence
of
merritt
broke
the
rap
on
the
door
of
man
and
those
words
which
harass
the
ease
of
the
country
doctor
when
he
tries
to
take
any
ease
wanted
in
the
surgery
if
you
please
lewis
bustled
out
and
appeared
no
more
that
night
the
doctor
had
been
summoned
to
a
little
hamlet
on
the
outskirts
of
porth
separated
from
it
by
half
a
mile
or
of
road
one
dignifies
indeed
this
settlement
without
a
name
in
calling
it
a
hamlet
it
was
a
mere
row
of
four
cottages
built
about
a
hundred
years
ago
for
the
accommodation
of
the
workers
in
a
quarry
long
since
disused
in
one
of
these
cottages
the
doctor
found
a
father
and
mother
weeping
and
crying
out
to
bach
doctor
bach
and
two
frightened
children
and
one
little
body
still
and
dead
it
was
the
youngest
of
the
three
little
johnnie
and
he
was
dead
the
doctor
found
that
the
child
had
been
asphyxiated
he
felt
the
clothes
they
were
dry
it
was
not
a
case
of
drowning
he
looked
at
the
neck
there
was
no
mark
of
strangling
he
asked
the
father
how
it
had
happened
and
father
and
mother
weeping
most
lamentably
declared
they
had
no
knowledge
of
how
their
child
had
been
killed
it
was
the
people
that
had
done
the
celtic
fairies
are
still
malignant
lewis
asked
what
had
happened
that
evening
where
had
the
child
been
he
with
his
brother
and
sister
they
know
anything
about
it
reduced
into
some
sort
of
order
from
its
original
piteous
confusion
this
is
the
story
that
the
doctor
gathered
all
three
children
had
been
well
and
happy
through
the
day
they
had
walked
in
with
the
mother
roberts
to
porth
on
a
marketing
expedition
in
the
afternoon
they
had
returned
to
the
cottage
had
had
their
tea
and
afterwards
played
about
on
the
road
in
front
of
the
house
john
roberts
had
come
home
somewhat
late
from
his
work
and
it
was
after
dusk
when
the
family
sat
down
to
supper
supper
over
the
three
children
went
out
again
to
play
with
other
children
from
the
cottage
next
door
roberts
telling
them
that
they
might
have
half
an
hour
before
going
to
bed
the
two
mothers
came
to
the
cottage
gates
at
the
same
moment
and
called
out
to
their
children
to
come
along
and
be
quick
about
it
the
two
small
families
had
been
playing
on
the
strip
of
turf
across
the
road
just
by
the
stile
into
the
fields
the
children
ran
across
the
road
all
of
them
except
johnnie
roberts
his
brother
willie
said
that
just
as
their
mother
called
them
he
heard
johnnie
cry
out
what
is
that
beautiful
shiny
thing
over
the
stile
chapter
x
the
child
and
the
moth
the
little
ran
across
the
road
up
the
path
and
into
the
lighted
room
then
they
noticed
that
johnnie
had
not
followed
them
roberts
was
doing
something
in
the
back
kitchen
and
roberts
had
gone
out
to
the
shed
to
bring
in
some
sticks
for
the
next
fire
roberts
heard
the
children
run
in
and
went
on
with
her
work
the
children
whispered
to
one
another
that
johnnie
would
when
their
mother
came
out
of
the
back
room
and
found
him
missing
but
they
expected
he
would
run
in
through
the
open
door
any
minute
but
six
or
seven
perhaps
ten
minutes
passed
and
there
was
no
johnnie
then
the
father
and
mother
came
into
the
kitchen
together
and
saw
that
their
little
boy
was
not
there
they
thought
it
was
some
small
piece
of
the
two
other
children
had
hidden
the
boy
somewhere
in
the
room
in
the
big
cupboard
perhaps
have
you
done
with
him
then
said
roberts
out
you
little
rascal
directly
in
a
there
was
no
little
rascal
to
come
out
and
margaret
roberts
the
girl
said
that
johnnie
had
not
come
across
the
road
with
them
he
must
be
still
playing
all
by
himself
by
the
hedge
did
you
let
him
stay
like
that
for
said
roberts
i
trust
you
for
two
minutes
together
indeed
to
goodness
you
are
all
of
you
more
trouble
than
you
are
she
went
to
the
open
door
come
you
in
directly
or
you
will
be
sorry
for
it
johnnie
the
poor
woman
called
at
the
door
she
went
out
to
the
gate
and
called
there
you
little
johnnie
come
you
bachgen
a
good
boy
i
do
see
you
hiding
she
thought
he
must
be
hiding
in
the
shadow
of
the
hedge
and
that
he
would
come
running
and
was
always
such
a
happy
little
her
across
the
road
but
no
little
merry
figure
danced
out
of
the
gloom
of
the
still
dark
night
it
was
all
silence
it
was
then
as
the
heart
began
to
chill
though
she
still
called
cheerfully
to
the
missing
child
that
the
elder
boy
told
how
johnnie
had
said
there
was
something
beautiful
by
the
stile
perhaps
he
did
climb
over
and
he
is
running
now
about
the
meadow
and
has
lost
his
the
father
got
his
lantern
then
and
the
whole
family
went
crying
and
calling
about
the
meadow
promising
cakes
and
sweets
and
a
fine
toy
to
poor
johnnie
if
he
would
come
to
them
they
found
the
little
body
under
the
ashgrove
in
the
middle
of
the
field
he
was
quite
still
and
dead
so
still
that
a
great
moth
had
settled
on
his
forehead
fluttering
away
when
they
lifted
him
up
lewis
heard
this
story
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
little
to
be
said
to
these
most
unhappy
people
care
of
the
two
that
you
have
left
to
you
said
the
doctor
as
he
went
away
let
them
out
of
your
sight
if
you
can
help
it
it
is
dreadful
times
that
we
are
living
it
is
curious
to
record
that
all
through
these
dreadful
times
the
simple
little
went
through
its
accustomed
course
at
porth
the
war
and
its
consequences
had
somewhat
thinned
the
numbers
of
the
summer
visitors
still
a
very
fair
contingent
of
them
occupied
the
hotels
and
and
and
bathed
from
the
machines
on
one
beach
or
from
the
tents
on
the
other
and
sauntered
in
the
sun
or
lay
stretched
out
in
the
shade
under
the
trees
that
grow
down
almost
to
the
edge
porth
never
tolerated
ethiopians
or
shows
of
any
kind
on
its
sands
but
did
very
well
during
that
summer
in
their
garden
entertainment
given
in
the
castle
grounds
and
the
companies
that
came
to
the
assembly
rooms
are
said
to
have
paid
their
bills
to
a
woman
and
to
a
man
porth
depends
very
largely
on
its
midland
and
northern
custom
custom
of
a
prosperous
sort
people
who
think
llandudno
overcrowded
and
colwyn
bay
too
raw
and
red
and
new
come
year
after
year
to
the
placid
old
town
in
the
southwest
and
delight
in
its
peace
and
as
i
say
they
enjoyed
themselves
much
as
usual
there
in
the
summer
of
now
and
then
they
became
conscious
as
merritt
became
conscious
that
they
could
not
wander
about
quite
in
the
old
way
but
they
accepted
sentries
and
and
people
who
politely
pointed
out
the
advantages
of
seeing
the
view
from
this
point
rather
than
from
that
as
very
necessary
consequences
of
the
dreadful
war
that
was
being
waged
nay
as
a
manchester
man
said
after
having
been
turned
back
from
his
favorite
walk
to
castell
coch
it
was
gratifying
to
think
that
they
were
so
well
looked
after
far
as
i
can
see
he
added
nothing
to
prevent
a
submarine
from
standing
out
there
by
ynys
sant
and
landing
half
a
dozen
men
in
a
collapsible
boat
in
any
of
these
little
coves
and
pretty
fools
we
should
look
we
with
our
throats
cut
on
the
sands
or
carried
back
to
germany
in
the
submarine
he
tipped
the
right
lad
he
said
give
us
the
now
here
was
a
strange
thing
the
had
his
thoughts
on
elusive
submarines
and
german
raiders
the
watcher
had
simply
received
instructions
to
keep
people
off
the
castell
coch
fields
without
reason
assigned
and
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
the
authorities
themselves
while
they
marked
out
the
fields
as
in
the
zone
gave
their
orders
in
the
dark
and
were
themselves
profoundly
in
the
dark
as
to
the
manner
of
the
slaughter
that
had
been
done
there
for
if
they
had
understood
what
had
happened
they
would
have
understood
also
that
their
restrictions
were
useless
the
manchester
man
was
warned
off
his
walk
about
ten
days
after
johnnie
death
the
watcher
had
been
placed
at
his
post
because
the
night
before
a
young
farmer
had
been
found
by
his
wife
lying
in
the
grass
close
to
the
castle
with
no
scar
on
him
nor
any
mark
of
violence
but
stone
dead
the
wife
of
the
dead
man
joseph
cradock
finding
her
husband
lying
motionless
on
the
dewy
turf
went
white
and
stricken
up
the
path
to
the
village
and
got
two
men
who
bore
the
body
to
the
farm
lewis
was
sent
for
and
knew
at
once
when
he
saw
the
dead
man
that
he
had
perished
in
the
way
that
the
little
roberts
boy
had
that
awful
way
might
be
cradock
had
been
asphyxiated
and
here
again
there
was
no
mark
of
a
grip
on
the
throat
it
might
have
been
a
piece
of
work
by
burke
and
hare
the
doctor
reflected
a
pitch
plaster
might
have
been
clapped
over
the
mouth
and
nostrils
and
held
there
then
a
thought
struck
him
his
had
talked
of
a
new
kind
of
poison
gas
that
was
said
to
be
used
against
the
munition
workers
in
the
midlands
was
it
possible
that
the
deaths
of
the
man
and
the
boy
were
due
to
some
such
instrument
he
applied
his
tests
but
could
find
no
trace
of
any
gas
having
been
employed
carbonic
acid
gas
a
man
could
not
be
killed
with
that
in
the
open
air
to
be
fatal
that
required
a
confined
space
such
a
position
as
the
bottom
of
a
huge
vat
or
of
a
well
he
did
not
know
how
cradock
had
been
killed
he
confessed
it
to
himself
he
had
been
suffocated
that
was
all
he
could
say
it
seemed
that
the
man
had
gone
out
at
about
nine
to
look
after
some
beasts
the
field
in
which
they
were
was
about
five
walk
from
the
house
he
told
his
wife
he
would
be
back
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
or
twenty
minutes
he
did
not
return
and
when
he
had
been
gone
for
of
an
hour
cradock
went
out
to
look
for
him
she
went
into
the
field
where
the
beasts
were
and
everything
seemed
all
right
but
there
was
no
trace
of
cradock
she
called
out
there
was
no
answer
now
the
meadow
in
which
the
cattle
were
pastured
is
high
ground
a
hedge
divides
it
from
the
fields
which
fall
gently
down
to
the
castle
and
the
sea
cradock
hardly
seemed
able
to
say
why
having
failed
to
find
her
husband
among
his
beasts
she
turned
to
the
path
which
led
to
castell
coch
she
said
at
first
that
she
had
thought
that
one
of
the
oxen
might
have
broken
through
the
hedge
and
strayed
and
that
cradock
had
perhaps
gone
after
it
and
then
correcting
herself
she
said
was
that
and
then
there
was
something
else
that
i
could
not
make
out
at
all
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
hedge
did
look
different
from
usual
to
be
sure
things
do
look
different
at
night
and
there
was
a
bit
of
sea
mist
about
but
somehow
it
did
look
odd
to
me
and
i
said
to
myself
i
lost
my
way
then
she
declared
that
the
shape
of
the
trees
in
the
hedge
appeared
to
have
changed
and
besides
it
had
a
look
if
it
was
lighted
up
somehow
and
so
she
went
on
towards
the
stile
to
see
what
all
this
could
be
and
when
she
came
near
everything
was
as
usual
she
looked
over
the
stile
and
called
and
hoped
to
see
her
husband
coming
towards
her
or
to
hear
his
voice
but
there
was
no
answer
and
glancing
down
the
path
she
saw
or
thought
she
saw
some
sort
of
brightness
on
the
ground
dim
sort
of
light
like
a
bunch
of
in
a
so
i
climbed
over
the
stile
and
went
down
the
path
and
the
light
seemed
to
melt
away
and
there
was
my
poor
husband
lying
on
his
back
saying
not
a
word
to
me
when
i
spoke
to
him
and
touched
so
for
lewis
the
terror
blackened
and
became
altogether
intolerable
and
others
he
perceived
felt
as
he
did
he
did
not
know
he
never
asked
whether
the
men
at
the
club
had
heard
of
these
deaths
of
the
child
and
the
young
farmer
but
no
one
spoke
of
them
indeed
the
change
was
evident
at
the
beginning
of
the
terror
men
spoke
of
nothing
else
now
it
had
become
all
too
awful
for
ingenious
chatter
or
labored
and
grotesque
theories
and
lewis
had
received
a
letter
from
his
at
midlingham
it
contained
the
sentence
am
afraid
health
has
not
greatly
benefited
by
her
visit
to
porth
there
are
still
several
symptoms
i
at
all
and
this
told
him
in
a
phraseology
that
the
doctor
and
merritt
had
agreed
upon
that
the
terror
remained
heavy
in
the
midland
town
it
was
soon
after
the
death
of
cradock
that
people
began
to
tell
strange
tales
of
a
sound
that
was
to
be
heard
of
nights
about
the
hills
and
valleys
to
the
northward
of
porth
a
man
who
had
missed
the
last
train
from
meiros
and
had
been
forced
to
tramp
the
ten
miles
between
meiros
and
porth
seems
to
have
been
the
first
to
hear
it
he
said
he
had
got
to
the
top
of
the
hill
by
tredonoc
somewhere
between
ten
and
eleven
when
he
first
noticed
an
odd
noise
that
he
could
not
make
out
at
all
it
was
like
a
shout
a
long
dismal
wail
coming
from
a
great
way
off
faint
with
distance
he
stopped
to
listen
thinking
at
first
that
it
might
be
owls
hooting
in
the
woods
but
it
was
different
he
said
from
that
it
was
a
long
cry
and
then
there
was
silence
and
then
it
began
over
again
he
could
make
nothing
of
it
and
feeling
frightened
he
did
not
quite
know
of
what
he
walked
on
briskly
and
was
glad
to
see
the
lights
of
porth
station
he
told
his
wife
of
this
dismal
sound
that
night
and
she
told
the
neighbors
and
most
of
them
thought
that
it
was
drink
or
the
owls
after
all
but
the
night
after
two
or
three
people
who
had
been
to
some
small
merrymaking
in
a
cottage
just
off
the
meiros
road
heard
the
sound
as
they
were
going
home
soon
after
ten
they
too
described
it
as
a
long
wailing
cry
indescribably
dismal
in
the
stillness
of
the
autumn
night
the
ghost
of
a
voice
said
one
if
it
came
up
from
the
bottom
of
the
earth
said
another
chapter
xi
at
treff
loyne
farm
let
it
be
remembered
again
and
again
that
all
the
while
that
the
terror
lasted
there
was
no
common
stock
of
information
as
to
the
dreadful
things
that
were
being
done
the
press
had
not
said
one
word
upon
it
there
was
no
criterion
by
which
the
mass
of
the
people
could
separate
fact
from
mere
vague
rumor
no
test
by
which
ordinary
misadventure
or
disaster
could
be
distinguished
from
the
achievements
of
the
secret
and
awful
force
that
was
at
work
and
so
with
every
event
of
the
passing
day
a
harmless
commercial
traveler
might
show
himself
in
the
course
of
his
business
in
the
tumbledown
main
street
of
meiros
and
find
himself
regarded
with
looks
of
fear
and
suspicion
as
a
possible
worker
of
murder
while
it
is
likely
enough
that
the
true
agents
of
the
terror
went
quite
unnoticed
and
since
the
real
nature
of
all
this
mystery
of
death
was
unknown
it
followed
easily
that
the
signs
and
warnings
and
omens
of
it
were
all
the
more
unknown
here
was
horror
there
was
horror
but
there
was
no
links
to
join
one
horror
with
another
no
common
basis
of
knowledge
from
which
the
connection
between
this
horror
and
that
horror
might
be
inferred
so
there
was
no
one
who
suspected
at
all
that
this
dismal
and
hollow
sound
that
was
now
heard
of
nights
in
the
region
to
the
north
of
porth
had
any
relation
at
all
to
the
case
of
the
little
girl
who
went
out
one
afternoon
to
pick
purple
flowers
and
never
returned
or
to
the
case
of
the
man
whose
body
was
taken
out
of
the
peaty
slime
of
the
marsh
or
to
the
case
of
cradock
dead
in
his
fields
with
a
strange
glimmering
of
light
about
his
body
as
his
wife
reported
and
it
is
a
question
as
to
how
far
the
rumor
of
this
melancholy
nocturnal
summons
got
abroad
at
all
lewis
heard
of
it
as
a
country
doctor
hears
of
most
things
driving
up
and
down
the
lanes
but
he
heard
of
it
without
much
interest
with
no
sense
that
it
was
in
any
sort
of
relation
to
the
terror
remnant
had
been
given
the
story
of
the
hollow
and
echoing
voice
of
the
darkness
in
a
colored
and
picturesque
form
he
employed
a
tredonoc
man
to
work
in
his
garden
once
a
week
the
gardener
had
not
heard
the
summons
himself
but
he
knew
a
man
who
had
done
so
jenkins
pentoppin
he
did
put
his
head
out
late
last
night
to
see
what
the
weather
was
like
as
he
was
cutting
a
field
of
corn
the
next
day
and
he
did
tell
me
that
when
he
was
with
the
methodists
in
cardigan
he
did
never
hear
no
singing
eloquence
in
the
chapels
that
was
like
to
it
he
did
declare
it
was
like
a
wailing
of
judgment
remnant
considered
the
matter
and
was
inclined
to
think
that
the
sound
must
be
caused
by
a
subterranean
inlet
of
the
sea
there
might
be
he
supposed
an
imperfect
or
or
tortuous
in
the
tredonoc
woods
and
the
noise
of
the
tide
surging
up
below
might
very
well
produce
that
effect
of
a
hollow
wailing
far
away
but
neither
he
nor
any
one
else
paid
much
attention
to
the
matter
save
the
few
who
heard
the
call
at
dead
of
night
as
it
echoed
awfully
over
the
black
hills
the
sound
had
been
heard
for
three
or
perhaps
four
nights
when
the
people
coming
out
of
tredonoc
church
after
morning
service
on
sunday
noticed
that
there
was
a
big
yellow
sheepdog
in
the
churchyard
the
dog
it
appeared
had
been
waiting
for
the
congregation
for
it
at
once
attached
itself
to
them
at
first
to
the
whole
body
and
then
to
a
group
of
half
a
dozen
who
took
the
turning
to
the
right
two
of
these
presently
went
off
over
the
fields
to
their
respective
houses
and
four
strolled
on
in
the
leisurely
manner
of
the
country
and
these
the
dog
followed
keeping
to
heel
all
the
time
the
men
were
talking
hay
corn
and
markets
and
paid
no
attention
to
the
animal
and
so
they
strolled
along
the
autumn
lane
till
they
came
to
a
gate
in
the
hedge
whence
a
roughly
made
farm
road
went
through
the
fields
and
dipped
down
into
the
woods
and
to
treff
loyne
farm
then
the
dog
became
like
a
possessed
creature
he
barked
furiously
he
ran
up
to
one
of
the
men
and
looked
up
at
him
if
he
were
begging
for
his
life
as
the
man
said
and
then
rushed
to
the
gate
and
stood
by
it
wagging
his
tail
and
barking
at
intervals
the
men
stared
and
laughed
dog
will
that
be
said
one
of
them
will
be
thomas
treff
loyne
said
another
then
why
he
go
home
go
home
then
he
went
through
the
gesture
of
picking
up
a
stone
from
the
road
and
throwing
it
at
the
dog
home
then
over
the
gate
with
but
the
dog
never
stirred
he
barked
and
whined
and
ran
up
to
the
men
and
then
back
to
the
gate
at
last
he
came
to
one
of
them
and
crawled
and
abased
himself
on
the
ground
and
then
took
hold
of
the
coat
and
tried
to
pull
him
in
the
direction
of
the
gate
the
farmer
shook
the
dog
off
and
the
four
went
on
their
way
and
the
dog
stood
in
the
road
and
watched
them
and
then
put
up
its
head
and
uttered
a
long
and
dismal
howl
that
was
despair
the
four
farmers
thought
nothing
of
it
sheepdogs
in
the
country
are
dogs
to
look
after
sheep
and
their
whims
and
fancies
are
not
studied
but
the
yellow
was
a
kind
of
degenerate
the
tredonoc
lanes
from
that
day
he
came
to
a
cottage
door
one
night
and
scratched
at
it
and
when
it
was
opened
lay
down
and
then
barking
ran
to
the
garden
gate
and
waited
entreating
as
it
seemed
the
cottager
to
follow
him
they
drove
him
away
and
again
he
gave
that
long
howl
of
anguish
it
was
almost
as
bad
they
said
as
the
noise
that
they
had
heard
a
few
nights
before
and
then
it
occurred
to
somebody
so
far
as
i
can
make
out
with
no
particular
reference
to
the
odd
conduct
of
the
treff
loyne
sheepdog
that
thomas
griffith
had
not
been
seen
for
some
time
past
he
had
missed
market
day
at
porth
he
had
not
been
at
tredonoc
church
where
he
was
a
pretty
regular
attendant
on
sunday
and
then
as
heads
were
put
together
it
appeared
that
nobody
had
seen
any
of
the
griffith
family
for
days
and
days
now
in
a
town
even
in
a
small
town
this
process
of
putting
heads
together
is
a
pretty
quick
business
in
the
country
especially
in
a
countryside
of
wild
lands
and
scattered
and
lonely
farms
and
cottages
the
affair
takes
time
harvest
was
going
on
everybody
was
busy
in
his
own
fields
and
after
the
long
hard
work
neither
the
farmer
nor
his
men
felt
inclined
to
stroll
about
in
search
of
news
or
gossip
a
harvester
at
the
end
is
ready
for
supper
and
sleep
and
for
nothing
else
and
so
it
was
late
in
that
week
when
it
was
discovered
that
thomas
griffith
and
all
his
house
had
vanished
from
this
world
i
have
often
been
reproached
for
my
curiosity
over
questions
which
are
apparently
of
slight
importance
or
of
no
importance
at
all
i
love
to
inquire
for
instance
into
the
question
of
the
visibility
of
a
lighted
candle
at
a
distance
suppose
that
is
a
candle
lighted
on
a
still
dark
night
in
the
country
what
is
the
greatest
distance
at
which
you
can
see
that
there
is
a
light
at
all
and
then
as
to
the
human
voice
what
is
its
carrying
distance
under
good
conditions
as
a
mere
sound
apart
from
any
matter
of
making
out
words
that
may
be
uttered
they
are
trivial
questions
no
doubt
but
they
have
always
interested
me
and
the
latter
point
has
its
application
to
the
strange
business
of
treff
loyne
that
melancholy
and
hollow
sound
that
wailing
summons
that
appalled
the
hearts
of
those
who
heard
it
was
indeed
a
human
voice
produced
in
a
very
exceptional
manner
and
it
seems
to
have
been
heard
at
points
varying
from
a
mile
and
a
half
to
two
miles
from
the
farm
i
do
not
know
whether
this
is
anything
extraordinary
i
do
not
know
whether
the
peculiar
method
of
production
was
calculated
to
increase
or
to
diminish
the
carrying
power
of
the
sound
again
and
again
i
have
laid
emphasis
in
this
story
of
the
terror
on
the
strange
isolation
of
many
of
the
farms
and
cottages
in
meirion
i
have
done
so
in
the
effort
to
convince
the
townsman
of
something
that
he
has
never
known
to
the
londoner
a
house
a
quarter
of
a
mile
from
the
outlying
suburban
lamp
with
no
other
dwelling
within
two
hundred
yards
is
a
lonely
house
a
place
to
fit
with
ghosts
and
mysteries
and
terrors
how
can
he
understand
then
the
true
loneliness
of
the
white
farmhouses
of
meirion
dotted
here
and
there
for
the
most
part
not
even
on
the
little
lanes
and
deep
winding
byways
but
set
in
the
very
heart
of
the
fields
or
alone
on
huge
bastioned
headlands
facing
the
sea
and
whether
on
the
high
verge
of
the
sea
or
on
the
hills
or
in
the
hollows
of
the
inner
country
hidden
from
the
sight
of
men
far
from
the
sound
of
any
common
call
there
is
penyrhaul
for
example
the
farm
from
which
the
foolish
merritt
thought
he
saw
signals
of
light
being
made
from
seaward
it
is
of
course
widely
visible
but
from
landward
owing
partly
to
the
curving
and
indented
configuration
of
the
bay
i
doubt
whether
any
other
habitation
views
it
from
a
nearer
distance
than
three
miles
and
of
all
these
hidden
and
remote
places
i
doubt
if
any
is
so
deeply
buried
as
treff
loyne
i
have
little
or
no
welsh
i
am
sorry
to
say
but
i
suppose
that
the
name
is
corrupted
from
trellwyn
or
place
in
the
grove
and
indeed
it
lies
in
the
very
heart
of
dark
overhanging
woods
a
deep
narrow
valley
runs
down
from
the
high
lands
of
the
allt
through
these
woods
through
steep
hillsides
of
bracken
and
gorse
right
down
to
the
great
marsh
whence
merritt
saw
the
dead
man
being
carried
the
valley
lies
away
from
any
road
even
from
that
little
better
than
a
bridlepath
where
the
four
farmers
returning
from
church
were
perplexed
by
the
strange
antics
of
the
sheepdog
one
can
not
say
that
the
valley
is
overlooked
even
from
a
distance
for
so
narrow
is
it
that
the
ashgroves
that
rim
it
on
either
side
seem
to
meet
and
shut
it
in
i
at
all
events
have
never
found
any
high
place
from
which
treff
loyne
is
visible
though
looking
down
from
the
allt
i
have
seen
blue
rising
from
its
hidden
chimneys
such
was
the
place
then
to
which
one
september
afternoon
a
party
went
up
to
discover
what
had
happened
to
griffith
and
his
family
there
were
half
a
dozen
farmers
a
couple
of
policemen
and
four
soldiers
carrying
their
arms
those
last
had
been
lent
by
the
officer
commanding
at
the
camp
lewis
too
was
of
the
party
he
had
heard
by
chance
that
no
one
knew
what
had
become
of
griffith
and
his
family
and
he
was
anxious
about
a
young
fellow
a
painter
of
his
acquaintance
who
had
been
lodging
at
treff
loyne
all
the
summer
they
all
met
by
the
gate
of
tredonoc
churchyard
and
tramped
solemnly
along
the
narrow
lane
all
of
them
i
think
with
some
vague
discomfort
of
mind
with
a
certain
shadowy
fear
as
of
men
who
do
not
quite
know
what
they
may
encounter
lewis
heard
the
corporal
and
the
three
soldiers
arguing
over
their
orders
captain
says
to
me
muttered
the
corporal
hesitate
to
shoot
if
any
what
sir
i
says
trouble
says
he
and
all
i
could
get
out
of
the
men
grumbled
in
reply
lewis
thought
he
heard
some
obscure
reference
to
and
wondered
what
they
were
talking
about
they
came
to
the
gate
in
the
hedge
where
the
farm
road
led
down
to
treff
loyne
they
followed
this
track
roughly
made
with
grass
growing
up
between
its
loosely
laid
stones
down
by
the
hedge
from
field
to
wood
till
at
last
they
came
to
the
sudden
walls
of
the
valley
and
the
sheltering
groves
of
the
ash
trees
here
the
way
curved
down
the
steep
hillside
and
bent
southward
and
followed
henceforward
the
hidden
hollow
of
the
valley
under
the
shadow
of
the
trees
here
was
the
farm
enclosure
the
outlying
walls
of
the
yard
and
the
barns
and
sheds
and
outhouses
one
of
the
farmers
threw
open
the
gate
and
walked
into
the
yard
and
forthwith
began
bellowing
at
the
top
of
his
voice
griffith
thomas
griffith
where
be
you
thomas
griffith
the
rest
followed
him
the
corporal
snapped
out
an
order
over
his
shoulder
and
there
was
a
rattling
metallic
noise
as
the
men
fixed
their
bayonets
and
became
in
an
instant
dreadful
dealers
out
of
death
in
place
of
harmless
fellows
with
a
feeling
for
beer
griffith
again
bellowed
the
farmer
there
was
no
answer
to
this
summons
but
they
found
poor
griffith
lying
on
his
face
at
the
edge
of
the
pond
in
the
middle
of
the
yard
there
was
a
ghastly
wound
in
his
side
as
if
a
sharp
stake
had
been
driven
into
his
body
chapter
xii
the
letter
of
wrath
it
was
a
still
september
afternoon
no
wind
stirred
in
the
hanging
woods
that
were
dark
all
about
the
ancient
house
of
treff
loyne
the
only
sound
in
the
dim
air
was
the
lowing
of
the
cattle
they
had
wandered
it
seemed
from
the
fields
and
had
come
in
by
the
gate
of
the
farmyard
and
stood
there
melancholy
as
if
they
mourned
for
their
dead
master
and
the
horses
four
great
heavy
beasts
they
were
there
too
and
in
the
lower
field
the
sheep
were
standing
as
if
they
waited
to
be
fed
would
think
they
all
knew
there
was
something
wrong
one
of
the
soldiers
muttered
to
another
a
pale
sun
showed
for
a
moment
and
glittered
on
their
bayonets
they
were
standing
about
the
body
of
poor
dead
griffith
with
a
certain
grimness
growing
on
their
faces
and
hardening
there
their
corporal
snapped
something
at
them
again
they
were
quite
ready
lewis
knelt
down
by
the
dead
man
and
looked
closely
at
the
great
gaping
wound
in
his
side
been
dead
a
long
time
he
said
week
two
weeks
perhaps
he
was
killed
by
some
sharp
pointed
weapon
how
about
the
family
how
many
are
there
of
them
i
never
attended
was
griffith
and
his
wife
and
his
son
thomas
and
mary
griffith
his
daughter
and
i
do
think
there
was
a
gentleman
lodging
with
them
this
that
was
from
one
of
the
farmers
they
all
looked
at
one
another
this
party
of
rescue
who
knew
nothing
of
the
danger
that
had
smitten
this
house
of
quiet
people
nothing
of
the
peril
which
had
brought
them
to
this
pass
of
a
farmyard
with
a
dead
man
in
it
and
his
beasts
standing
patiently
about
him
as
if
they
waited
for
the
farmer
to
rise
up
and
give
them
their
food
then
the
party
turned
to
the
house
it
was
an
old
sixteenth
century
building
with
the
singular
round
chimney
that
is
characteristic
of
meirion
the
walls
were
snowy
with
whitewash
the
windows
were
deeply
set
and
stone
mullioned
and
a
solid
porch
sheltered
the
doorway
from
any
winds
that
might
penetrate
to
the
hollow
of
that
hidden
valley
the
windows
were
shut
tight
there
was
no
sign
of
any
life
or
movement
about
the
place
the
party
of
men
looked
at
one
another
and
the
churchwarden
amongst
the
farmers
the
sergeant
of
police
lewis
and
the
corporal
drew
together
is
it
to
goodness
doctor
said
the
churchwarden
can
tell
you
nothing
at
that
that
poor
man
there
has
been
pierced
to
the
heart
said
lewis
you
think
they
are
inside
and
they
will
shoot
us
said
another
farmer
he
had
no
notion
of
what
he
meant
by
and
no
one
of
them
knew
better
than
he
they
did
not
know
what
the
danger
was
or
where
it
might
strike
them
or
whether
it
was
from
without
or
from
within
they
stared
at
the
murdered
man
and
gazed
dismally
at
one
another
said
lewis
must
do
something
we
must
get
into
the
house
and
see
what
is
but
suppose
they
are
at
us
while
we
are
getting
in
said
the
sergeant
shall
we
be
then
doctor
lewis
the
corporal
put
one
of
his
men
by
the
gate
at
the
top
of
the
farmyard
another
at
the
gate
by
the
bottom
of
the
farmyard
and
told
them
to
challenge
and
shoot
the
doctor
and
the
rest
opened
the
little
gate
of
the
front
garden
and
went
up
to
the
porch
and
stood
listening
by
the
door
it
was
all
dead
silence
lewis
took
an
ash
stick
from
one
of
the
farmers
and
beat
heavily
three
times
on
the
old
black
oaken
door
studded
with
antique
nails
he
struck
three
thundering
blows
and
then
they
all
waited
there
was
no
answer
from
within
he
beat
again
and
still
silence
he
shouted
to
the
people
within
but
there
was
no
answer
they
all
turned
and
looked
at
one
another
that
party
of
quest
and
rescue
who
knew
not
what
they
sought
what
enemy
they
were
to
encounter
there
was
an
iron
ring
on
the
door
lewis
turned
it
but
the
door
stood
fast
it
was
evidently
barred
and
bolted
the
sergeant
of
police
called
out
to
open
but
again
there
was
no
answer
they
consulted
together
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
blow
the
door
open
and
some
one
of
them
called
in
a
loud
voice
to
anybody
that
might
be
within
to
stand
away
from
the
door
or
they
would
be
killed
and
at
this
very
moment
the
yellow
sheepdog
came
bounding
up
the
yard
from
the
woods
and
licked
their
hands
and
fawned
on
them
and
barked
joyfully
now
said
one
of
the
farmers
did
know
that
there
was
something
amiss
a
pity
it
was
thomas
williams
that
we
did
not
follow
him
when
he
implored
us
last
the
corporal
motioned
the
rest
of
the
party
back
and
they
stood
looking
fearfully
about
them
at
the
entrance
to
the
porch
the
corporal
disengaged
his
bayonet
and
shot
into
the
keyhole
calling
out
once
more
before
he
fired
he
shot
and
shot
again
so
heavy
and
firm
was
the
ancient
door
so
stout
its
bolts
and
fastenings
at
last
he
had
to
fire
at
the
massive
hinges
and
then
they
all
pushed
together
and
the
door
lurched
open
and
fell
forward
the
corporal
raised
his
left
hand
and
stepped
back
a
few
paces
he
hailed
his
two
men
at
the
top
and
bottom
of
the
farmyard
they
were
all
right
they
said
and
so
the
party
climbed
and
struggled
over
the
fallen
door
into
the
passage
and
into
the
kitchen
of
the
farmhouse
young
griffith
was
lying
dead
before
the
hearth
before
a
dead
fire
of
white
wood
ashes
they
went
on
towards
the
and
in
the
doorway
of
the
room
was
the
body
of
the
artist
secretan
as
if
he
had
fallen
in
trying
to
get
to
the
kitchen
upstairs
the
two
women
griffith
and
her
daughter
a
girl
of
eighteen
were
lying
together
on
the
bed
in
the
big
bedroom
clasped
in
each
arms
they
went
about
the
house
searched
the
pantries
the
back
kitchen
and
the
cellars
there
was
no
life
in
it
said
lewis
when
they
came
back
to
the
big
kitchen
it
is
as
if
they
had
been
besieged
do
you
see
that
piece
of
bacon
half
gnawed
through
then
they
found
these
pieces
of
bacon
cut
from
the
sides
on
the
kitchen
wall
here
and
there
about
the
house
there
was
no
bread
in
the
place
no
milk
no
water
said
one
of
the
farmers
had
the
best
water
here
in
all
meirion
the
well
is
down
there
in
the
wood
it
is
most
famous
water
the
old
people
did
use
to
call
it
ffynnon
teilo
it
was
saint
well
they
did
must
have
died
of
thirst
said
lewis
have
been
dead
for
days
and
the
group
of
men
stood
in
the
big
kitchen
and
stared
at
one
another
a
dreadful
perplexity
in
their
eyes
the
dead
were
all
about
them
within
the
house
and
without
it
and
it
was
in
vain
to
ask
why
they
had
died
thus
the
old
man
had
been
killed
with
the
piercing
thrust
of
some
sharp
weapon
the
rest
had
perished
it
seemed
probable
of
thirst
but
what
possible
enemy
was
this
that
besieged
the
farm
and
shut
in
its
inhabitants
there
was
no
answer
the
sergeant
of
police
spoke
of
getting
a
cart
and
taking
the
bodies
into
porth
and
lewis
went
into
the
parlor
that
secretan
had
used
as
a
intending
to
gather
any
possessions
or
effects
of
the
dead
artist
that
he
might
find
there
half
a
dozen
portfolios
were
piled
up
in
one
corner
there
were
some
books
on
a
side
table
a
and
basket
behind
the
seemed
all
no
doubt
there
would
be
clothes
and
such
matters
upstairs
and
lewis
was
about
to
rejoin
the
rest
of
the
party
in
the
kitchen
when
he
looked
down
at
some
scattered
papers
lying
with
the
books
on
the
side
table
on
one
of
the
sheets
he
read
to
his
astonishment
the
words
james
lewis
this
was
written
in
a
staggering
trembling
scrawl
and
examining
the
other
leaves
he
saw
that
they
were
covered
with
writing
the
table
stood
in
a
dark
corner
of
the
room
and
lewis
gathered
up
the
sheets
of
paper
and
took
them
to
the
and
began
to
read
amazed
at
certain
phrases
that
had
caught
his
eye
but
the
manuscript
was
in
disorder
as
if
the
dead
man
who
had
written
it
had
not
been
equal
to
the
task
of
gathering
the
leaves
into
their
proper
sequence
it
was
some
time
before
the
doctor
had
each
page
in
its
place
this
was
the
statement
that
he
read
with
wonder
while
a
couple
of
the
farmers
were
harnessing
one
of
the
horses
in
the
yard
to
a
cart
and
the
others
were
bringing
down
the
dead
women
do
not
think
that
i
can
last
much
longer
we
shared
out
the
last
drops
of
water
a
long
time
ago
i
do
not
know
how
many
days
ago
we
fall
asleep
and
dream
and
walk
about
the
house
in
our
dreams
and
i
am
often
not
sure
whether
i
am
awake
or
still
dreaming
and
so
the
days
and
nights
are
confused
in
my
mind
i
awoke
not
long
ago
at
least
i
suppose
i
awoke
and
found
i
was
lying
in
the
passage
i
had
a
confused
feeling
that
i
had
had
an
awful
dream
which
seemed
horribly
real
and
i
thought
for
a
moment
what
a
relief
it
was
to
know
that
it
true
whatever
it
might
have
been
i
made
up
my
mind
to
have
a
good
long
walk
to
freshen
myself
up
and
then
i
looked
round
and
found
that
i
had
been
lying
on
the
stones
of
the
passage
and
it
all
came
back
to
me
there
was
no
walk
for
me
have
not
seen
griffith
or
her
daughter
for
a
long
while
they
said
they
were
going
upstairs
to
have
a
rest
i
heard
them
moving
about
the
room
at
first
now
i
can
hear
nothing
young
griffith
is
lying
in
the
kitchen
before
the
hearth
he
was
talking
to
himself
about
the
harvest
and
the
weather
when
i
last
went
into
the
kitchen
he
seem
to
know
i
was
there
as
he
went
gabbling
on
in
a
low
voice
very
fast
and
then
he
began
to
call
the
dog
tiger
seems
no
hope
for
any
of
us
we
are
in
the
dream
of
death
here
the
manuscript
became
unintelligible
for
half
a
dozen
lines
secretan
had
written
the
words
of
three
or
four
times
over
he
had
begun
a
fresh
word
and
had
scratched
it
out
and
then
followed
strange
unmeaning
characters
the
script
as
lewis
thought
of
a
terrible
language
and
then
the
writing
became
clear
clearer
than
it
was
at
the
beginning
of
the
manuscript
and
the
sentences
flowed
more
easily
as
if
the
cloud
on
mind
had
lifted
for
a
while
there
was
a
fresh
start
as
it
were
and
the
writer
began
again
in
ordinary
lewis
hope
you
will
excuse
all
this
confusion
and
wandering
i
intended
to
begin
a
proper
letter
to
you
and
now
i
find
all
that
stuff
that
you
have
been
this
ever
gets
into
your
hands
i
have
not
the
energy
even
to
tear
it
up
if
you
read
it
you
will
know
to
what
a
sad
pass
i
had
come
when
it
was
written
it
looks
like
delirium
or
a
bad
dream
and
even
now
though
my
mind
seems
to
have
cleared
up
a
good
deal
i
have
to
hold
myself
in
tightly
to
be
sure
that
the
experiences
of
the
last
days
in
this
awful
place
are
true
real
things
not
a
long
nightmare
from
which
i
shall
wake
up
presently
and
find
myself
in
my
rooms
at
chelsea
have
said
of
what
i
am
writing
it
ever
gets
into
your
hands
and
i
am
not
at
all
sure
that
it
ever
will
if
what
is
happening
here
is
happening
everywhere
else
then
i
suppose
the
world
is
coming
to
an
end
i
can
not
understand
it
even
now
i
can
hardly
believe
it
i
know
that
i
dream
such
wild
dreams
and
walk
in
such
mad
fancies
that
i
have
to
look
out
and
look
about
me
to
make
sure
that
i
am
not
still
dreaming
you
remember
that
talk
we
had
about
two
months
ago
when
i
dined
with
you
we
got
on
somehow
or
other
to
space
and
time
and
i
think
we
agreed
that
as
soon
as
one
tried
to
reason
about
space
and
time
one
was
landed
in
a
maze
of
contradictions
you
said
something
to
the
effect
that
it
was
very
curious
but
this
was
just
like
a
dream
man
will
sometimes
wake
himself
from
his
crazy
dream
you
said
realizing
that
he
is
thinking
and
we
both
wondered
whether
these
contradictions
that
one
avoid
if
one
begins
to
think
of
time
and
space
may
not
really
be
proofs
that
the
whole
of
life
is
a
dream
and
the
moon
and
the
stars
bits
of
nightmare
i
have
often
thought
over
that
lately
i
kick
at
the
walls
as
johnson
kicked
at
the
stone
to
make
sure
that
the
things
about
me
are
there
and
then
that
other
question
gets
into
my
the
world
really
coming
to
an
end
the
world
as
we
have
always
known
it
and
what
on
earth
will
this
new
world
be
like
i
imagine
it
a
story
like
ark
and
the
flood
people
used
to
talk
about
the
end
of
the
world
and
fire
but
no
one
ever
thought
of
anything
like
this
then
another
thing
that
bothers
me
now
and
then
i
wonder
whether
we
are
not
all
mad
together
in
this
house
in
spite
of
what
i
see
and
know
or
perhaps
i
should
say
because
what
i
see
and
know
is
so
impossible
i
wonder
whether
we
are
not
all
suffering
from
a
delusion
perhaps
we
are
our
own
gaolers
and
we
are
really
free
to
go
out
and
live
perhaps
what
we
think
we
see
is
not
there
at
all
i
believe
i
have
heard
of
whole
families
going
mad
together
and
i
may
have
come
under
the
influence
of
the
house
having
lived
in
it
for
the
last
four
months
i
know
there
have
been
people
who
have
been
kept
alive
by
their
keepers
forcing
food
down
their
throats
because
they
are
quite
sure
that
their
throats
are
closed
so
that
they
feel
they
are
unable
to
swallow
a
morsel
i
wonder
now
and
then
whether
we
are
all
like
this
in
treff
loyne
yet
in
my
heart
i
feel
sure
that
it
is
not
so
i
do
not
want
to
leave
a
letter
behind
me
and
so
i
will
not
tell
you
the
full
story
of
what
i
have
seen
or
believe
i
have
seen
if
i
am
a
sane
man
you
will
be
able
to
fill
in
the
blanks
for
yourself
from
your
own
knowledge
if
i
am
mad
burn
the
letter
and
say
nothing
about
it
or
indeed
i
am
not
quite
may
wake
up
and
hear
mary
griffith
calling
to
me
in
her
cheerful
that
breakfast
will
be
ready
in
a
minute
and
i
shall
enjoy
it
and
walk
over
to
porth
and
tell
you
the
queerest
most
horrible
dream
that
a
man
ever
had
and
ask
what
i
had
better
take
think
that
it
was
on
a
tuesday
that
we
first
noticed
that
there
was
something
queer
about
only
at
the
time
we
know
that
there
was
anything
really
queer
in
what
we
noticed
i
had
been
out
since
nine
in
the
morning
trying
to
paint
the
marsh
and
i
found
it
a
very
tough
job
i
came
home
about
five
or
six
and
found
the
family
at
treff
loyne
laughing
at
old
tiger
the
sheepdog
he
was
making
short
runs
from
the
farmyard
to
the
door
of
the
house
barking
with
quick
short
yelps
griffith
and
miss
griffith
were
standing
by
the
porch
and
the
dog
would
go
to
them
look
in
their
faces
and
then
run
up
the
farmyard
to
the
gate
and
then
look
back
with
that
eager
yelping
bark
as
if
he
were
waiting
for
the
women
to
follow
him
then
again
and
again
he
ran
up
to
them
and
tugged
at
their
skirts
as
if
he
would
pull
them
by
main
force
away
from
the
house
the
men
came
home
from
the
fields
and
he
repeated
this
performance
the
dog
was
running
all
up
and
down
the
farmyard
in
and
out
of
the
barn
and
sheds
yelping
barking
and
always
with
that
eager
run
to
the
person
he
addressed
and
running
away
directly
and
looking
back
as
if
to
see
whether
we
were
following
him
when
the
house
door
was
shut
and
they
all
sat
down
to
supper
he
would
give
them
no
peace
till
at
last
they
turned
him
out
of
doors
and
then
he
sat
in
the
porch
and
scratched
at
the
door
with
his
claws
barking
all
the
while
when
the
daughter
brought
in
my
meal
she
said
think
what
is
come
to
old
tiger
and
indeed
he
has
always
been
a
good
dog
dog
barked
and
yelped
and
whined
and
scratched
at
the
door
all
through
the
evening
they
let
him
in
once
but
he
seemed
to
have
become
quite
frantic
he
ran
up
to
one
member
of
the
family
after
another
his
eyes
were
bloodshot
and
his
mouth
was
foaming
and
he
tore
at
their
clothes
till
they
drove
him
out
again
into
the
darkness
then
he
broke
into
a
long
lamentable
howl
of
anguish
and
we
heard
no
more
of
chapter
xiii
the
last
words
of
secretan
slept
ill
that
night
i
awoke
again
and
again
from
uneasy
dreams
and
i
seemed
in
my
sleep
to
hear
strange
calls
and
noises
and
a
sound
of
murmurs
and
beatings
on
the
door
there
were
deep
hollow
voices
too
that
echoed
in
my
sleep
and
when
i
woke
i
could
hear
the
autumn
wind
mournful
on
the
hills
above
us
i
started
up
once
with
a
dreadful
scream
in
my
ears
but
then
the
house
was
all
still
and
i
fell
again
into
uneasy
sleep
was
soon
after
dawn
when
i
finally
roused
myself
the
people
in
the
house
were
talking
to
each
other
in
high
voices
arguing
about
something
that
i
did
not
understand
is
those
damned
gipsies
i
tell
you
said
old
griffith
would
they
do
a
thing
like
that
for
asked
griffith
it
was
stealing
is
more
likely
that
john
jenkins
has
done
it
out
of
spite
said
the
son
said
that
he
would
remember
you
when
we
did
catch
him
seemed
puzzled
and
angry
so
far
as
i
could
make
out
but
not
at
all
frightened
i
got
up
and
began
to
dress
i
think
i
looked
out
of
the
window
the
glass
on
my
is
high
and
broad
and
the
window
is
small
one
would
have
to
poke
head
round
the
glass
to
see
anything
voices
were
still
arguing
downstairs
i
heard
the
old
man
say
for
a
beginning
anyhow
and
then
the
door
slammed
minute
later
the
old
man
shouted
i
think
to
his
son
then
there
was
a
great
noise
which
i
will
not
describe
more
particularly
and
a
dreadful
screaming
and
crying
inside
the
house
and
a
sound
of
rushing
feet
they
all
cried
out
at
once
to
each
other
i
heard
the
daughter
crying
is
no
good
mother
he
is
dead
indeed
they
have
killed
him
and
griffith
screaming
to
the
girl
to
let
her
go
and
then
one
of
them
rushed
out
of
the
kitchen
and
shot
the
great
bolts
of
oak
across
the
door
just
as
something
beat
against
it
with
a
thundering
crash
ran
downstairs
i
found
them
all
in
wild
confusion
in
an
agony
of
grief
and
horror
and
amazement
they
were
like
people
who
had
seen
something
so
awful
that
they
had
gone
mad
went
to
the
window
looking
out
on
the
farmyard
i
tell
you
all
that
i
saw
but
i
saw
poor
old
griffith
lying
by
the
pond
with
the
blood
pouring
out
of
his
side
wanted
to
go
out
to
him
and
bring
him
in
but
they
told
me
that
he
must
be
stone
dead
and
such
things
also
that
it
was
quite
plain
that
any
one
who
went
out
of
the
house
would
not
live
more
than
a
moment
we
could
not
believe
it
even
as
we
gazed
at
the
body
of
the
dead
man
but
it
was
there
i
used
to
wonder
sometimes
what
one
would
feel
like
if
one
saw
an
apple
drop
from
the
tree
and
shoot
up
into
the
air
and
disappear
i
think
i
know
now
how
one
would
feel
then
we
believe
that
it
would
last
we
were
not
seriously
afraid
for
ourselves
we
spoke
of
getting
out
in
an
hour
or
two
before
dinner
anyhow
it
last
because
it
was
impossible
indeed
at
twelve
young
griffith
said
he
would
go
down
to
the
well
by
the
back
way
and
draw
another
pail
of
water
i
went
to
the
door
and
stood
by
it
he
had
not
gone
a
dozen
yards
before
they
were
on
him
he
ran
for
his
life
and
we
had
all
we
could
do
to
bar
the
door
in
time
and
then
i
began
to
get
frightened
we
could
not
believe
in
it
somebody
would
come
along
shouting
in
an
hour
or
two
and
it
would
all
melt
away
and
vanish
there
could
not
be
any
real
danger
there
was
plenty
of
bacon
in
the
house
and
half
the
weekly
baking
of
loaves
and
some
beer
in
the
cellar
and
a
pound
or
so
of
tea
and
a
whole
pitcher
of
water
that
had
been
drawn
from
the
well
the
night
before
we
could
do
all
right
for
the
day
and
in
the
morning
it
would
have
all
gone
away
day
followed
day
and
it
was
still
there
i
knew
treff
loyne
was
a
lonely
was
why
i
had
gone
there
to
have
a
long
rest
from
all
the
jangle
and
rattle
and
turmoil
of
london
that
makes
a
man
alive
and
kills
him
too
i
went
to
treff
loyne
because
it
was
buried
in
the
narrow
valley
under
the
ash
trees
far
away
from
any
track
there
was
not
so
much
as
a
footpath
that
was
near
it
no
one
ever
came
that
way
young
griffith
had
told
me
that
it
was
a
mile
and
a
half
to
the
nearest
house
and
the
thought
of
the
silent
peace
and
retirement
of
the
farm
used
to
be
a
delight
to
me
now
this
thought
came
back
without
delight
with
terror
griffith
thought
that
a
shout
might
be
heard
on
a
still
night
up
away
on
the
allt
a
man
was
listening
for
it
he
added
doubtfully
my
voice
was
clearer
and
stronger
than
his
and
on
the
second
night
i
said
i
would
go
up
to
my
bedroom
and
call
for
help
through
the
open
window
i
waited
till
it
was
all
dark
and
still
and
looked
out
through
the
window
before
opening
it
and
then
i
saw
over
the
ridge
of
the
long
barn
across
the
yard
what
looked
like
a
tree
though
i
knew
there
was
no
tree
there
it
was
a
dark
mass
against
the
sky
with
boughs
a
tree
of
thick
dense
growth
i
wondered
what
this
could
be
and
i
threw
open
the
window
not
only
because
i
was
going
to
call
for
help
but
because
i
wanted
to
see
more
clearly
what
the
dark
growth
over
the
barn
really
was
saw
in
the
depth
of
the
dark
of
it
points
of
fire
and
colors
in
light
all
glowing
and
moving
and
the
air
trembled
i
stared
out
into
the
night
and
the
dark
tree
lifted
over
the
roof
of
the
barn
and
rose
up
in
the
air
and
floated
towards
me
i
did
not
move
till
at
the
last
moment
when
it
was
close
to
the
house
and
then
i
saw
what
it
was
and
banged
the
window
down
only
just
in
time
i
had
to
fight
and
i
saw
the
tree
that
was
like
a
burning
cloud
rise
up
in
the
night
and
sink
again
and
settle
over
the
barn
told
them
downstairs
of
this
they
sat
with
white
faces
and
griffith
said
that
ancient
devils
were
let
loose
and
had
come
out
of
the
trees
and
out
of
the
old
hills
because
of
the
wickedness
that
was
on
the
earth
she
began
to
murmur
something
to
herself
something
that
sounded
to
me
like
latin
went
up
to
my
room
again
an
hour
later
but
the
dark
tree
swelled
over
the
barn
another
day
went
by
and
at
dusk
i
looked
out
but
the
eyes
of
fire
were
watching
me
i
dared
not
open
the
window
then
i
thought
of
another
plan
there
was
the
great
old
fireplace
with
the
round
flemish
chimney
going
high
above
the
house
if
i
stood
beneath
it
and
shouted
i
thought
perhaps
the
sound
might
be
carried
better
than
if
i
called
out
of
the
window
for
all
i
knew
the
round
chimney
might
act
as
a
sort
of
megaphone
night
after
night
then
i
stood
in
the
hearth
and
called
for
help
from
nine
to
eleven
i
thought
of
the
lonely
place
deep
in
the
valley
of
the
ashtrees
of
the
lonely
hills
and
lands
about
it
i
thought
of
the
little
cottages
far
away
and
hoped
that
my
voice
might
reach
to
those
within
them
i
thought
of
the
winding
lane
high
on
the
allt
and
of
the
few
men
that
came
there
of
nights
but
i
hoped
that
my
cry
might
come
to
one
of
them
we
had
drunk
up
the
beer
and
we
would
only
let
ourselves
have
water
by
little
drops
and
on
the
fourth
night
my
throat
was
dry
and
i
began
to
feel
strange
and
weak
i
knew
that
all
the
voice
i
had
in
my
lungs
would
hardly
reach
the
length
of
the
field
by
the
farm
was
then
we
began
to
dream
of
wells
and
fountains
and
water
coming
very
cold
in
little
drops
out
of
rocky
places
in
the
middle
of
a
cool
wood
we
had
given
up
all
meals
now
and
then
one
would
cut
a
lump
from
the
sides
of
bacon
on
the
kitchen
wall
and
chew
a
bit
of
it
but
the
saltness
was
like
fire
was
a
great
shower
of
rain
one
night
the
girl
said
we
might
open
a
window
and
hold
out
bowls
and
basins
and
catch
the
rain
i
spoke
of
the
cloud
with
burning
eyes
she
said
will
go
to
the
window
in
the
dairy
at
the
back
and
one
of
us
can
get
some
water
at
all
she
stood
up
with
her
basin
on
the
stone
slab
in
the
dairy
and
looked
out
and
heard
the
plashing
of
the
rain
falling
very
fast
and
she
unfastened
the
catch
of
the
window
and
had
just
opened
it
gently
with
one
hand
for
about
an
inch
and
had
her
basin
in
the
other
hand
then
said
she
was
something
that
began
to
tremble
and
shudder
and
shake
as
it
did
when
we
went
to
the
choral
festival
at
and
the
organ
played
and
there
was
the
cloud
and
the
burning
close
before
then
we
began
to
dream
as
i
say
i
woke
up
in
my
one
hot
afternoon
when
the
sun
was
shining
and
i
had
been
looking
and
searching
in
my
dream
all
through
the
house
and
i
had
gone
down
to
the
old
cellar
that
used
the
cellar
with
the
pillars
and
the
vaulted
room
with
an
iron
pike
in
my
hand
something
said
to
me
that
there
was
water
there
and
in
my
dream
i
went
to
a
heavy
stone
by
the
middle
pillar
and
raised
it
up
and
there
beneath
was
a
bubbling
well
of
cold
clear
water
and
i
had
just
hollowed
my
hand
to
drink
it
when
i
woke
i
went
into
the
kitchen
and
told
young
griffith
i
said
i
was
sure
there
was
water
there
he
shook
his
head
but
he
took
up
the
great
kitchen
poker
and
we
went
down
to
the
old
cellar
i
showed
him
the
stone
by
the
pillar
and
he
raised
it
up
but
there
was
no
well
you
know
i
reminded
myself
of
many
people
whom
i
have
met
in
life
i
would
not
be
convinced
i
was
sure
that
after
all
there
was
a
well
there
they
had
a
cleaver
in
the
kitchen
and
i
took
it
down
to
the
old
cellar
and
hacked
at
the
ground
with
it
the
others
interfere
with
me
we
were
getting
past
that
we
hardly
ever
spoke
to
one
another
each
one
would
be
wandering
about
the
house
upstairs
and
downstairs
each
one
of
us
i
suppose
bent
on
his
own
foolish
plan
and
mad
design
but
we
hardly
ever
spoke
years
ago
i
was
an
actor
for
a
bit
and
i
remember
how
it
was
on
first
nights
the
actors
treading
softly
up
and
down
the
wings
by
their
entrance
their
lips
moving
and
muttering
over
the
words
of
their
parts
but
without
a
word
for
one
another
so
it
was
with
us
i
came
upon
young
griffith
one
evening
evidently
trying
to
make
a
subterranean
passage
under
one
of
the
walls
of
the
house
i
knew
he
was
mad
as
he
knew
i
was
mad
when
he
saw
me
digging
for
a
well
in
the
cellar
but
neither
said
anything
to
the
other
we
are
past
all
this
we
are
too
weak
we
dream
when
we
are
awake
and
when
we
dream
we
think
we
wake
night
and
day
come
and
go
and
we
mistake
one
for
another
i
hear
griffith
murmuring
to
himself
about
the
stars
when
the
sun
is
high
at
noonday
and
at
midnight
i
have
found
myself
thinking
that
i
walked
in
bright
sunlit
meadows
beside
cold
rushing
streams
that
flowed
from
high
rocks
at
the
dawn
figures
in
black
robes
carrying
lighted
tapers
in
their
hands
pass
slowly
about
and
about
and
i
hear
great
rolling
organ
music
that
sounds
as
if
some
tremendous
rite
were
to
begin
and
voices
crying
in
an
ancient
song
shrill
from
the
depths
of
the
earth
a
little
while
ago
i
heard
a
voice
which
sounded
as
if
it
were
at
my
very
ears
but
rang
and
echoed
and
resounded
as
if
it
were
rolling
and
reverberated
from
the
vault
of
some
cathedral
chanting
in
terrible
modulations
i
heard
the
words
quite
clearly
liber
iræ
domini
dei
here
beginneth
the
book
of
the
wrath
of
the
lord
our
god
then
the
voice
sang
the
word
prolonging
it
it
seemed
through
ages
and
a
light
was
extinguished
as
it
began
the
chapter
that
day
saith
the
lord
there
shall
be
a
cloud
over
the
land
and
in
the
cloud
a
burning
and
a
shape
of
fire
and
out
of
the
cloud
shall
issue
forth
my
messengers
they
shall
run
all
together
they
shall
not
turn
aside
this
shall
be
a
day
of
exceeding
bitterness
without
salvation
and
on
every
high
hill
saith
the
lord
of
hosts
i
will
set
my
sentinels
and
my
armies
shall
encamp
in
the
place
of
every
valley
in
the
house
that
is
amongst
rushes
i
will
execute
judgment
and
in
vain
shall
they
fly
for
refuge
to
the
munitions
of
the
rocks
in
the
groves
of
the
woods
in
the
places
where
the
leaves
are
as
a
tent
above
them
they
shall
find
the
sword
of
the
slayer
and
they
that
put
their
trust
in
walled
cities
shall
be
confounded
woe
unto
the
armed
man
woe
unto
him
that
taketh
pleasure
in
the
strength
of
his
artillery
for
a
little
thing
shall
smite
him
and
by
one
that
hath
no
might
shall
he
be
brought
down
into
the
dust
that
which
is
low
shall
be
set
on
high
i
will
make
the
lamb
and
the
young
sheep
to
be
as
the
lion
from
the
swellings
of
jordan
they
shall
not
spare
saith
the
lord
and
the
doves
shall
be
as
eagles
on
the
hill
engedi
none
shall
be
found
that
may
abide
the
onset
of
their
now
i
can
hear
the
voice
rolling
far
away
as
if
it
came
from
the
altar
of
a
great
church
and
i
stood
at
the
door
there
are
lights
very
far
away
in
the
hollow
of
a
vast
darkness
and
one
by
one
they
are
put
out
i
hear
a
voice
chanting
again
with
that
endless
modulation
that
climbs
and
aspires
to
the
stars
and
shines
there
and
rushes
down
to
the
dark
depths
of
the
earth
again
to
ascend
the
word
is
here
the
manuscript
lapsed
again
and
finally
into
utter
lamentable
confusion
there
were
scrawled
lines
wavering
across
the
page
on
which
secretan
seemed
to
have
been
trying
to
note
the
unearthly
music
that
swelled
in
his
dying
ears
as
the
scrapes
and
scratches
of
ink
showed
he
had
tried
hard
to
begin
a
new
sentence
the
pen
had
dropped
at
last
out
of
his
hand
upon
the
paper
leaving
a
blot
and
a
smear
upon
it
lewis
heard
the
tramp
of
feet
along
the
passage
they
were
carrying
out
the
dead
to
the
cart
chapter
xiv
the
end
of
the
terror
lewis
maintained
that
we
should
never
begin
to
understand
the
real
significance
of
life
until
we
began
to
study
just
those
aspects
of
it
which
we
now
dismiss
and
overlook
as
utterly
inexplicable
and
therefore
unimportant
we
were
discussing
a
few
months
ago
the
awful
shadow
of
the
terror
which
at
length
had
passed
away
from
the
land
i
had
formed
my
opinion
partly
from
observation
partly
from
certain
facts
which
had
been
communicated
to
me
and
the
passwords
having
been
exchanged
i
found
that
lewis
had
come
by
very
different
ways
to
the
same
end
yet
he
said
is
not
a
true
end
or
rather
it
is
like
all
the
ends
of
human
inquiry
it
leads
one
to
a
great
mystery
we
must
confess
that
what
has
happened
might
have
happened
at
any
time
in
the
history
of
the
world
it
did
not
happen
till
a
year
ago
as
a
matter
of
fact
and
therefore
we
made
up
our
minds
that
it
never
could
happen
or
one
would
better
say
it
was
outside
the
range
even
of
imagination
but
this
is
our
way
most
people
are
quite
sure
that
the
black
the
never
invade
europe
again
they
have
made
up
their
complacent
minds
that
it
was
due
to
dirt
and
bad
drainage
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
plague
had
nothing
to
do
with
dirt
or
with
drains
and
there
is
nothing
to
prevent
its
ravaging
england
but
if
you
tell
people
so
they
believe
you
they
believe
in
anything
that
there
at
the
particular
moment
when
you
are
talking
to
them
as
with
the
plague
so
with
the
terror
we
could
not
believe
that
such
a
thing
could
ever
happen
remnant
said
truly
enough
that
whatever
it
was
it
was
outside
theory
outside
our
theory
flatland
can
not
believe
in
the
cube
or
the
i
agreed
with
all
this
i
added
that
sometimes
the
world
was
incapable
of
seeing
much
less
believing
that
which
was
before
its
own
eyes
i
said
any
eighteenth
century
print
of
a
gothic
cathedral
you
will
find
that
the
trained
artistic
eye
even
could
not
behold
in
any
true
sense
the
building
that
was
before
it
i
have
seen
an
old
print
of
peterborough
cathedral
that
looks
as
if
the
artist
had
drawn
it
from
a
clumsy
model
constructed
of
bent
wire
and
because
gothic
was
outside
the
æsthetic
theory
and
therefore
vision
of
the
time
you
believe
what
you
see
rather
you
see
what
you
believe
it
was
so
during
the
time
of
the
terror
all
this
bears
out
what
coleridge
said
as
to
the
necessity
of
having
the
idea
before
the
facts
could
be
of
any
service
to
one
of
course
he
was
right
mere
facts
without
the
correlating
idea
are
nothing
and
lead
to
no
conclusion
we
had
plenty
of
facts
but
we
could
make
nothing
of
them
i
went
home
at
the
tail
of
that
dreadful
procession
from
treff
loyne
in
a
state
of
mind
very
near
to
madness
i
heard
one
of
the
soldiers
saying
to
the
other
no
rat
spike
a
man
to
the
heart
i
know
why
but
i
felt
that
if
i
heard
any
more
of
such
talk
as
that
i
should
go
crazy
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
anchors
of
reason
were
parting
i
left
the
party
and
took
the
short
cut
across
the
fields
into
porth
i
looked
up
davies
in
the
high
street
and
arranged
with
him
that
he
should
take
on
any
cases
i
might
have
that
evening
and
then
i
went
home
and
gave
my
man
his
instructions
to
send
people
on
and
then
i
shut
myself
up
to
think
it
all
i
could
must
not
suppose
that
my
experiences
of
that
afternoon
had
afforded
me
the
slightest
illumination
indeed
if
it
had
not
been
that
i
had
seen
poor
old
body
lying
pierced
in
his
own
farmyard
i
think
i
should
have
been
inclined
to
accept
one
of
hints
and
to
believe
that
the
whole
family
had
fallen
a
victim
to
a
collective
delusion
or
hallucination
and
had
shut
themselves
up
and
died
of
thirst
through
sheer
madness
i
think
there
have
been
such
cases
the
insanity
of
inhibition
the
belief
that
you
do
something
which
you
are
really
perfectly
capable
of
doing
but
i
had
seen
the
body
of
the
murdered
man
and
the
wound
that
had
killed
him
the
manuscript
left
by
secretan
give
me
no
hint
well
it
seemed
to
me
to
make
confusion
worse
confounded
you
have
seen
it
you
know
that
in
certain
places
it
is
evidently
mere
delirium
the
wanderings
of
a
dying
mind
how
was
i
to
separate
the
facts
from
the
the
key
to
the
whole
enigma
delirium
is
often
a
sort
of
a
sort
of
magnified
and
distorted
shadow
of
actualities
but
it
is
a
very
difficult
thing
almost
an
impossible
thing
to
reconstruct
the
real
house
from
the
distortion
of
it
thrown
on
the
clouds
of
the
brain
you
see
secretan
in
writing
that
extraordinary
document
almost
insisted
on
the
fact
that
he
was
not
in
his
proper
sense
that
for
days
he
had
been
part
asleep
part
awake
part
delirious
how
was
one
to
judge
his
statement
to
separate
delirium
from
fact
in
one
thing
he
stood
confirmed
you
remember
he
speaks
of
calling
for
help
up
the
old
chimney
of
treff
loyne
that
did
seem
to
fit
in
with
the
tales
of
a
hollow
moaning
cry
that
had
been
heard
upon
the
allt
so
far
one
could
take
him
as
a
recorder
of
actual
experiences
and
i
looked
in
the
old
cellars
of
the
farm
and
found
a
frantic
sort
of
dug
by
one
of
the
pillars
again
he
was
confirmed
but
what
was
one
to
make
of
that
story
of
the
chanting
voice
and
the
letters
of
the
hebrew
alphabet
and
the
chapter
out
of
some
unknown
minor
prophet
when
one
has
the
key
it
is
easy
enough
to
sort
out
the
facts
or
the
hints
of
facts
from
the
delusions
but
i
the
key
on
that
september
evening
i
was
forgetting
the
with
lights
and
fires
in
it
that
i
think
impressed
me
more
than
anything
with
the
feeling
that
story
was
in
the
main
a
true
story
i
had
seen
a
like
appearance
down
there
in
my
own
garden
but
what
was
it
i
was
saying
that
paradoxically
it
is
only
by
the
inexplicable
things
that
life
can
be
explained
we
are
apt
to
say
you
know
very
odd
and
pass
the
matter
by
as
if
there
were
no
more
to
be
said
or
as
if
that
were
the
end
of
it
well
i
believe
that
the
only
real
path
lies
through
the
blind
do
you
mean
this
is
an
instance
of
what
i
mean
i
told
you
about
merritt
my
and
the
capsizing
of
that
boat
the
he
had
seen
he
said
signal
lights
flashing
from
one
of
the
farms
on
the
coast
and
he
was
quite
certain
that
the
two
things
were
intimately
connected
as
cause
and
effect
i
thought
it
all
nonsense
and
i
was
wondering
how
i
was
going
to
shut
him
up
when
a
big
moth
flew
into
the
room
through
that
window
fluttered
about
and
succeeded
in
burning
itself
alive
in
the
lamp
that
gave
me
my
cue
i
asked
merritt
if
he
knew
why
moths
made
for
lamps
or
something
of
the
kind
i
thought
it
would
be
a
hint
to
him
that
i
was
sick
of
his
flashlights
and
his
theories
so
it
looked
sulky
and
held
his
tongue
a
few
minutes
later
i
was
called
out
by
a
man
who
had
found
his
little
boy
dead
in
a
field
near
his
cottage
about
an
hour
before
the
child
was
so
still
they
said
that
a
great
moth
had
settled
on
his
forehead
and
only
fluttered
away
when
they
lifted
up
the
body
it
was
absolutely
illogical
but
it
was
this
odd
of
the
moth
in
my
lamp
and
the
moth
on
the
dead
forehead
that
first
set
me
on
the
track
i
say
that
it
guided
me
in
any
real
sense
it
was
more
like
a
great
flare
of
red
paint
on
a
wall
it
rang
up
my
attention
if
i
may
say
so
it
was
a
sort
of
shock
like
a
bang
on
the
big
drum
no
doubt
merritt
was
talking
great
nonsense
that
evening
so
far
as
his
particular
instance
went
the
flashes
of
light
from
the
farm
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
wreck
of
the
boat
but
his
general
principle
was
sound
when
you
hear
a
gun
go
off
and
see
a
man
fall
it
is
idle
to
talk
of
mere
i
think
a
very
interesting
book
might
be
written
on
this
question
i
would
call
it
grammar
of
as
you
will
remember
from
having
read
my
notes
on
the
matter
i
was
called
in
about
ten
days
later
to
see
a
man
named
cradock
who
had
been
found
in
a
field
near
his
farm
quite
dead
this
also
was
at
night
his
wife
found
him
and
there
were
some
very
queer
things
in
her
story
she
said
that
the
hedge
of
the
field
looked
as
if
it
were
changed
she
began
to
be
afraid
that
she
had
lost
her
way
and
got
into
the
wrong
field
then
she
said
the
hedge
was
lighted
up
as
if
there
were
a
lot
of
in
it
and
when
she
peered
over
the
stile
there
seemed
to
be
some
kind
of
glimmering
upon
the
ground
and
then
the
glimmering
melted
away
and
she
found
her
body
near
where
this
light
had
been
now
this
man
cradock
had
been
suffocated
just
as
the
little
boy
roberts
had
been
suffocated
and
as
that
man
in
the
midlands
who
took
a
short
cut
one
night
had
been
suffocated
then
i
remembered
that
poor
johnnie
roberts
had
called
out
about
over
the
stile
just
before
he
played
truant
then
on
my
part
i
had
to
contribute
the
very
remarkable
sight
i
witnessed
here
as
i
looked
down
over
the
garden
the
appearance
as
of
a
spreading
tree
where
i
knew
there
was
no
such
tree
and
then
the
shining
and
burning
of
lights
and
moving
colors
like
the
poor
child
and
cradock
i
had
seen
something
shiny
just
as
some
man
in
stratfordshire
had
seen
a
dark
cloud
with
points
of
fire
in
it
floating
over
the
trees
and
cradock
thought
that
the
shape
of
the
trees
in
the
hedge
had
changed
mind
almost
uttered
the
word
that
was
wanted
but
you
see
the
difficulties
this
set
of
circumstances
could
not
so
far
as
i
could
see
have
any
relation
with
the
other
circumstances
of
the
terror
how
could
i
connect
all
this
with
the
bombs
and
of
the
midlands
with
the
armed
men
who
kept
watch
about
the
munition
shops
by
day
and
night
then
there
was
the
long
list
of
people
here
who
had
fallen
over
the
cliffs
or
into
the
quarry
there
were
the
cases
of
the
men
stifled
in
the
slime
of
the
marshes
there
was
the
affair
of
the
family
murdered
in
front
of
their
cottage
on
the
highway
there
was
the
capsized
i
could
not
see
any
thread
that
could
bring
all
these
incidents
together
they
seemed
to
me
to
be
hopelessly
disconnected
i
could
not
make
out
any
relation
between
the
agency
that
beat
out
the
brains
of
the
and
the
agency
that
overturned
the
boat
i
know
but
i
think
very
likely
if
nothing
more
had
happened
that
i
should
have
put
the
whole
thing
down
as
an
unaccountable
series
of
crimes
and
accidents
which
chanced
to
occur
in
meirion
in
the
summer
of
well
of
course
that
would
have
been
an
impossible
standpoint
in
view
of
certain
incidents
in
story
still
if
one
is
confronted
by
the
insoluble
one
lets
it
go
at
last
if
the
mystery
is
inexplicable
one
pretends
that
there
any
mystery
that
is
the
justification
for
what
is
called
free
thinking
came
that
extraordinary
business
of
treff
loyne
i
put
that
on
one
side
i
pretend
that
nothing
strange
or
out
of
the
way
had
happened
there
was
no
getting
over
it
or
getting
round
it
i
had
seen
with
my
eyes
that
there
was
a
mystery
and
a
most
horrible
mystery
i
have
forgotten
my
logic
but
one
might
say
that
treff
loyne
demonstrated
the
existence
of
a
mystery
in
the
figure
of
death
took
it
all
home
as
i
have
told
you
and
sat
down
for
the
evening
before
it
it
appalled
me
not
only
by
its
horror
but
here
again
by
the
discrepancy
between
its
terms
old
griffith
so
far
as
i
could
judge
had
been
killed
by
the
thrust
of
a
pike
or
perhaps
of
a
sharpened
stake
how
could
one
relate
this
to
the
burning
tree
that
had
floated
over
the
ridge
of
the
barn
it
was
as
if
i
said
to
you
is
a
man
drowned
and
here
is
a
man
burned
alive
show
that
each
death
was
caused
by
the
same
agency
and
the
moment
that
i
left
this
particular
case
of
treff
loyne
and
tried
to
get
some
light
on
it
from
other
instances
of
the
terror
i
would
think
of
the
man
in
the
midlands
who
heard
the
feet
of
a
thousand
men
rustling
in
the
wood
and
their
voices
as
if
dead
men
sat
up
in
their
bones
and
talked
and
then
i
would
say
to
myself
how
about
that
boat
overturned
in
a
calm
sea
there
seemed
no
end
to
it
no
hope
of
any
solution
was
i
believe
a
sudden
leap
of
the
mind
that
liberated
me
from
the
tangle
it
was
quite
beyond
logic
i
went
back
to
that
evening
when
merritt
was
boring
me
with
his
flashlights
to
the
moth
in
the
candle
and
to
the
moth
on
the
forehead
of
poor
johnnie
roberts
there
was
no
sense
in
it
but
i
suddenly
determined
that
the
child
and
joseph
cradock
the
farmer
and
that
unnamed
stratfordshire
man
all
found
at
night
all
asphyxiated
had
been
choked
by
vast
swarms
of
moths
i
pretend
even
now
that
this
is
demonstrated
but
sure
true
suppose
you
encounter
a
swarm
of
these
creatures
in
the
dark
suppose
the
smaller
ones
fly
up
your
nostrils
you
will
gasp
for
breath
and
open
your
mouth
then
suppose
some
hundreds
of
them
fly
into
your
mouth
into
your
gullet
into
your
windpipe
what
will
happen
to
you
you
will
be
dead
in
a
very
short
time
choked
the
moths
would
be
dead
too
they
would
be
found
in
the
moths
do
you
know
that
it
is
extremely
difficult
to
kill
a
moth
with
cyanide
of
potassium
take
a
frog
kill
it
open
its
stomach
there
you
will
find
its
dinner
of
moths
and
small
beetles
and
the
will
shake
itself
and
walk
off
cheerily
to
resume
an
entirely
active
existence
no
that
is
no
difficulty
now
i
came
to
this
i
was
shutting
out
all
the
other
cases
i
was
confining
myself
to
those
that
came
under
the
one
formula
i
got
to
the
assumption
or
conclusion
whichever
you
like
that
certain
people
had
been
asphyxiated
by
the
action
of
moths
i
had
accounted
for
that
extraordinary
appearance
of
burning
or
colored
lights
that
i
had
witnessed
myself
when
i
saw
the
growth
of
that
strange
tree
in
my
garden
that
was
clearly
the
cloud
with
points
of
fire
in
it
that
the
stratfordshire
man
took
for
a
new
and
terrible
kind
of
poison
gas
that
was
the
shiny
something
that
poor
little
johnnie
roberts
had
seen
over
the
stile
that
was
the
glimmering
light
that
had
led
cradock
to
her
dead
body
that
was
the
assemblage
of
terrible
eyes
that
had
watched
over
treff
loyne
by
night
once
on
the
right
track
i
understood
all
this
for
coming
into
this
room
in
the
dark
i
have
been
amazed
by
the
wonderful
burning
and
the
strange
fiery
colors
of
the
eyes
of
a
single
moth
as
it
crept
up
the
pane
of
glass
outside
imagine
the
effect
of
myriads
of
such
eyes
of
the
movement
of
these
lights
and
fires
in
a
vast
swarm
of
moths
each
insect
being
in
constant
motion
while
it
kept
its
place
in
the
mass
i
felt
that
all
this
was
clear
and
certain
the
next
step
of
course
we
know
nothing
really
about
moths
rather
we
know
nothing
of
moth
reality
for
all
i
know
there
may
be
hundreds
of
books
which
treat
of
moth
and
nothing
but
moth
but
these
are
scientific
books
and
science
only
deals
with
surfaces
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
is
impertinent
if
it
attempts
to
do
with
realities
to
take
a
very
minor
matter
we
even
know
why
the
moth
desires
the
flame
but
we
do
know
what
the
moth
does
not
do
it
does
not
gather
itself
into
swarms
with
the
object
of
destroying
human
life
but
here
by
the
hypothesis
were
cases
in
which
the
moth
had
done
this
very
thing
the
moth
race
had
entered
it
seemed
into
a
malignant
conspiracy
against
the
human
race
it
was
quite
impossible
no
is
to
say
it
had
never
happened
i
could
see
no
escape
from
this
conclusion
insects
then
were
definitely
hostile
to
man
and
then
i
stopped
for
i
could
not
see
the
next
step
obvious
though
it
seems
to
me
now
i
believe
that
the
scraps
of
talk
on
the
way
to
treff
loyne
and
back
flung
the
next
plank
over
the
gulf
they
had
spoken
of
poison
of
no
rat
being
able
to
spike
a
man
through
the
heart
and
then
suddenly
i
saw
my
way
clear
if
the
moths
were
infected
with
hatred
of
men
and
possessed
the
design
and
the
power
of
combining
against
him
why
not
suppose
this
hatred
this
design
this
power
shared
by
other
creatures
secret
of
the
terror
might
be
condensed
into
a
sentence
the
animals
had
revolted
against
men
the
puzzle
became
easy
enough
one
had
only
to
classify
take
the
cases
of
the
people
who
met
their
deaths
by
falling
over
cliffs
or
over
the
edge
of
quarries
we
think
of
sheep
as
timid
creatures
who
always
ran
away
but
suppose
sheep
that
run
away
and
after
all
in
reason
why
should
they
run
away
quarry
or
no
quarry
cliff
or
no
cliff
what
would
happen
to
you
if
a
hundred
sheep
ran
after
you
instead
of
running
from
you
there
would
be
no
help
for
it
they
would
have
you
down
and
beat
you
to
death
or
stifle
you
then
suppose
man
woman
or
child
near
a
edge
or
a
and
a
sudden
rush
of
sheep
clearly
there
is
no
help
there
is
nothing
for
it
but
to
go
over
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
that
is
what
happened
in
all
these
cases
again
you
know
the
country
and
you
know
how
a
herd
of
cattle
will
sometimes
pursue
people
through
the
fields
in
a
solemn
stolid
sort
of
way
they
behave
as
if
they
wanted
to
close
in
on
you
townspeople
sometimes
get
frightened
and
scream
and
run
you
or
i
would
take
no
notice
or
at
the
utmost
wave
our
sticks
at
the
herd
which
will
stop
dead
or
lumber
off
but
suppose
they
lumber
off
the
mildest
old
cow
remember
is
stronger
than
any
man
what
can
one
man
or
half
a
dozen
men
do
against
half
a
hundred
of
these
beasts
no
longer
restrained
by
that
mysterious
inhibition
which
has
made
for
ages
the
strong
the
humble
slaves
of
the
weak
but
if
you
are
botanizing
in
the
marsh
like
that
poor
fellow
who
was
staying
at
porth
and
forty
or
fifty
young
cattle
gradually
close
round
you
and
refuse
to
move
when
you
shout
and
wave
your
stick
but
get
closer
and
closer
instead
and
get
you
into
the
slime
again
where
is
your
help
if
you
got
an
automatic
pistol
you
must
go
down
and
stay
down
while
the
beasts
lie
quietly
on
you
for
five
minutes
it
was
a
quicker
death
for
poor
griffith
of
treff
of
his
own
beasts
gored
him
to
death
with
one
sharp
thrust
of
its
horn
into
his
heart
and
from
that
morning
those
within
the
house
were
closely
besieged
by
their
own
cattle
and
horses
and
sheep
and
when
those
unhappy
people
within
opened
a
window
to
call
for
help
or
to
catch
a
few
drops
of
rain
water
to
relieve
their
burning
thirst
the
cloud
waited
for
them
with
its
myriad
eyes
of
fire
can
you
wonder
that
statement
reads
in
places
like
mania
you
perceive
the
horrible
position
of
those
people
in
treff
loyne
not
only
did
they
see
death
advancing
on
them
but
advancing
with
incredible
steps
as
if
one
were
to
die
not
only
in
nightmare
but
by
nightmare
but
no
one
in
his
wildest
most
fiery
dreams
had
ever
imagined
such
a
fate
i
am
not
astonished
that
secretan
at
one
moment
suspected
the
evidence
of
his
own
senses
at
another
surmised
that
the
end
had
how
about
the
who
were
murdered
on
the
highway
near
here
horses
were
the
murderers
the
horses
that
afterwards
stampeded
the
camp
below
by
some
means
which
is
still
obscure
to
me
they
lured
that
family
into
the
road
and
beat
their
brains
out
their
shod
hoofs
were
the
instruments
of
execution
and
as
for
the
the
boat
that
was
capsized
i
have
no
doubt
that
it
was
overturned
by
a
sudden
rush
of
the
porpoises
that
were
gamboling
about
in
the
water
of
larnac
bay
a
porpoise
is
a
heavy
a
dozen
of
them
could
easily
upset
a
light
the
munition
works
their
enemy
was
rats
i
believe
that
it
has
been
calculated
that
in
the
number
of
rats
is
about
equal
to
the
number
of
human
beings
that
is
there
are
about
seven
millions
of
them
the
proportion
would
be
about
the
same
in
all
the
great
centers
of
population
and
the
rat
moreover
is
on
occasion
migratory
in
its
habits
you
can
understand
now
that
story
of
the
beating
about
the
mouth
of
the
thames
and
at
last
cast
away
by
arcachon
her
only
crew
dry
heaps
of
bones
the
rat
is
an
expert
boarder
of
ships
and
so
one
can
understand
the
tale
told
by
the
frightened
man
who
took
the
path
by
the
wood
that
led
up
from
the
new
munition
works
he
thought
he
heard
a
thousand
men
treading
softly
through
the
wood
and
chattering
to
one
another
in
some
horrible
tongue
what
he
did
hear
was
the
marshaling
of
an
army
of
array
before
the
battle
conceive
the
terror
of
such
an
attack
even
one
rat
in
a
fury
is
said
to
be
an
ugly
customer
to
meet
conceive
then
the
irruption
of
these
terrible
swarming
myriads
rushing
upon
the
helpless
unprepared
astonished
workers
in
the
munition
there
can
be
no
doubt
i
think
that
lewis
was
entirely
justified
in
these
extraordinary
conclusions
as
i
say
i
had
arrived
at
pretty
much
the
same
end
by
different
ways
but
this
rather
as
to
the
general
situation
while
lewis
had
made
his
own
particular
study
of
those
circumstances
of
the
terror
that
were
within
his
immediate
purview
as
a
physician
in
large
practice
in
the
southern
part
of
meirion
of
some
of
the
cases
which
he
reviewed
he
had
no
doubt
no
immediate
or
knowledge
but
he
judged
these
instances
by
their
similarity
to
the
facts
which
had
come
under
his
personal
notice
he
spoke
of
the
affairs
of
the
quarry
at
llanfihangel
on
the
analogy
of
the
people
who
were
found
dead
at
the
bottom
of
the
cliffs
near
porth
and
he
was
no
doubt
justified
in
doing
so
he
told
me
that
thinking
the
whole
matter
over
he
was
hardly
more
astonished
by
the
terror
in
itself
than
by
the
strange
way
in
which
he
had
arrived
at
his
conclusions
know
he
said
certain
evidences
of
animal
malevolence
which
we
knew
of
the
bees
that
stung
the
child
to
death
the
trusted
turning
savage
and
so
forth
well
i
got
no
light
whatever
from
all
this
it
suggested
nothing
to
because
i
had
not
got
that
which
coleridge
rightly
holds
necessary
in
all
inquiry
facts
facts
as
we
said
mean
nothing
and
come
to
nothing
you
do
not
believe
therefore
you
can
not
see
then
when
the
truth
at
last
appeared
it
was
through
the
whimsical
as
we
call
such
signs
of
the
moth
in
my
lamp
and
the
moth
on
the
dead
forehead
this
i
think
is
very
there
seems
to
have
been
one
beast
that
remained
faithful
the
dog
at
treff
loyne
that
is
remains
a
it
would
not
be
wise
even
now
to
describe
too
closely
the
terrible
scenes
that
were
to
be
seen
in
the
munition
areas
of
the
north
and
the
midlands
during
the
black
months
of
the
terror
out
of
the
factories
issued
at
black
midnight
the
shrouded
dead
in
their
coffins
and
their
very
kinsfolk
did
not
know
how
they
had
come
by
their
deaths
all
the
towns
were
full
of
houses
of
mourning
were
full
of
dark
and
terrible
rumors
incredible
as
the
incredible
reality
there
were
things
done
and
suffered
that
perhaps
never
will
be
brought
to
light
memories
and
secret
traditions
of
these
things
will
be
whispered
in
families
delivered
from
father
to
son
growing
wilder
with
the
passage
of
the
years
but
never
growing
wilder
than
the
truth
it
is
enough
to
say
that
the
cause
of
the
allies
was
for
awhile
in
deadly
peril
the
men
at
the
front
called
in
their
extremity
for
guns
and
shells
no
one
told
them
what
was
happening
in
the
places
where
these
munitions
were
made
at
first
the
position
was
nothing
less
than
desperate
men
in
high
places
were
almost
ready
to
cry
to
the
enemy
but
after
the
first
panic
measures
were
taken
such
as
those
described
by
merritt
in
his
account
of
the
matter
the
workers
were
armed
with
special
weapons
guards
were
mounted
were
placed
in
position
bombs
and
liquid
flame
were
ready
against
the
obscene
hordes
of
the
enemy
and
the
found
a
fire
fiercer
than
their
own
many
deaths
occurred
amongst
the
airmen
but
they
too
were
given
special
guns
arms
that
scattered
shot
broadcast
and
so
drove
away
the
dark
flights
that
threatened
the
airplanes
and
then
in
the
winter
of
the
terror
ended
suddenly
as
it
had
begun
once
more
a
sheep
was
a
frightened
beast
that
ran
instinctively
from
a
little
child
the
cattle
were
again
solemn
stupid
creatures
void
of
harm
the
spirit
and
the
convention
of
malignant
design
passed
out
of
the
hearts
of
all
the
animals
the
chains
that
they
had
cast
off
for
awhile
were
thrown
again
about
them
and
finally
there
comes
the
inevitable
why
did
the
beasts
who
had
been
humbly
and
patiently
subject
to
man
or
affrighted
by
his
presence
suddenly
know
their
strength
and
learn
how
to
league
together
and
declare
bitter
war
against
their
ancient
master
it
is
a
most
difficult
and
obscure
question
i
give
what
explanation
i
have
to
give
with
very
great
diffidence
and
an
eminent
disposition
to
be
corrected
if
a
clearer
light
can
be
found
some
friends
of
mine
for
whose
judgment
i
have
very
great
respect
are
inclined
to
think
that
there
was
a
certain
contagion
of
hate
they
hold
that
the
fury
of
the
whole
world
at
war
the
great
passion
of
death
that
seems
driving
all
humanity
to
destruction
infected
at
last
these
lower
creatures
and
in
place
of
their
native
instinct
of
submission
gave
them
rage
and
wrath
and
ravening
this
may
be
the
explanation
i
can
not
say
that
it
is
not
so
because
i
do
not
profess
to
understand
the
working
of
the
universe
but
i
confess
that
the
theory
strikes
me
as
fanciful
there
may
be
a
contagion
of
hate
as
there
is
a
contagion
of
smallpox
i
do
not
know
but
i
hardly
believe
it
in
my
opinion
and
it
is
only
an
opinion
the
source
of
the
great
revolt
of
the
beasts
is
to
be
sought
in
a
much
subtler
region
of
inquiry
i
believe
that
the
subjects
revolted
because
the
king
abdicated
man
has
dominated
the
beasts
throughout
the
ages
the
spiritual
has
reigned
over
the
rational
through
the
peculiar
quality
and
grace
of
spirituality
that
men
possess
that
makes
a
man
to
be
that
which
he
is
and
when
he
maintained
this
power
and
grace
i
think
it
is
pretty
clear
that
between
him
and
the
animals
there
was
a
certain
treaty
and
alliance
there
was
supremacy
on
the
one
hand
and
submission
on
the
other
but
at
the
same
time
there
was
between
the
two
that
cordiality
which
exists
between
lords
and
subjects
in
a
state
i
know
a
socialist
who
maintains
that
give
a
picture
of
true
democracy
i
do
not
know
about
that
but
i
see
that
knight
and
miller
were
able
to
get
on
quite
pleasantly
together
just
because
the
knight
knew
that
he
was
a
knight
and
the
miller
knew
that
he
was
a
miller
if
the
knight
had
had
conscientious
objections
to
his
knightly
grade
while
the
miller
saw
no
reason
why
he
should
not
be
a
knight
i
am
sure
that
their
intercourse
would
have
been
difficult
unpleasant
and
perhaps
murderous
so
with
man
i
believe
in
the
strength
and
truth
of
tradition
a
learned
man
said
to
me
a
few
weeks
ago
i
have
to
choose
between
the
evidence
of
tradition
and
the
evidence
of
a
document
i
always
believe
the
evidence
of
tradition
documents
may
be
falsified
and
often
are
falsified
tradition
is
never
this
is
true
and
therefore
i
think
one
may
put
trust
in
the
vast
body
of
folklore
which
asserts
that
there
was
once
a
worthy
and
friendly
alliance
between
man
and
the
beasts
our
popular
tale
of
dick
whittington
and
his
cat
no
doubt
represents
the
adaptation
of
a
very
ancient
legend
to
a
comparatively
modern
personage
but
we
may
go
back
into
the
ages
and
find
the
popular
tradition
asserting
that
not
only
are
the
animals
the
subjects
but
also
the
friends
of
man
all
that
was
in
virtue
of
that
singular
spiritual
element
in
man
which
the
rational
animals
do
not
possess
spiritual
does
not
mean
respectable
it
does
not
even
mean
moral
it
does
not
mean
in
the
ordinary
acceptation
of
the
word
it
signifies
the
royal
prerogative
of
man
differentiating
him
from
the
beasts
for
long
ages
he
has
been
putting
off
this
royal
robe
he
has
been
wiping
the
balm
of
consecration
from
his
own
breast
he
has
declared
again
and
again
that
he
is
not
spiritual
but
rational
that
is
the
equal
of
the
beasts
over
whom
he
was
once
sovereign
he
has
vowed
that
he
is
not
orpheus
but
caliban
but
the
beasts
also
have
within
them
something
which
corresponds
to
the
spiritual
quality
in
are
content
to
call
it
instinct
they
perceived
that
the
throne
was
even
friendship
was
possible
between
them
and
the
monarch
if
he
were
not
king
he
was
a
sham
an
imposter
a
thing
to
be
destroyed
hence
i
think
the
terror
they
have
risen
may
rise
again
the
end
