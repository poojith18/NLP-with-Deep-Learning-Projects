i
the
strange
return
of
old
baldy
you
find
your
knife
bob
such
good
luck
kind
of
queer
it
beginning
to
think
so
myself
and
bob
archer
looked
meaningly
at
his
chum
as
though
a
suspicion
might
be
forming
in
his
mind
to
the
effect
that
there
was
a
practical
joke
back
of
it
all
and
that
frank
haywood
really
knew
more
about
the
missing
article
than
he
chose
to
admit
and
yet
frank
as
a
rule
was
not
given
to
pranks
you
go
all
over
the
ground
where
ted
conway
was
teaching
you
yesterday
how
to
pick
up
a
handkerchief
from
the
back
of
a
galloping
pony
frank
continued
every
foot
of
it
and
more
replied
bob
still
find
the
knife
you
value
so
much
persisted
his
chum
saw
a
sign
of
it
replied
bob
whose
home
had
originally
been
in
old
kentucky
although
a
year
or
so
back
he
had
come
to
the
southwest
to
live
his
father
being
interested
in
various
ranches
and
mines
with
colonel
leonidas
haywood
well
i
worry
about
it
too
much
observed
frank
sure
to
turn
up
sooner
or
later
perhaps
one
of
the
boys
happened
to
pick
it
up
and
is
waiting
for
an
owner
to
claim
asked
every
one
on
the
ranch
bob
went
on
gloomily
they
all
had
the
same
story
to
saw
the
thing
i
hate
to
have
anything
like
that
happen
seems
as
if
i
feel
every
little
while
that
on
the
tip
of
my
tongue
to
say
what
i
did
with
that
knife
then
i
get
all
mixed
up
again
and
for
the
life
of
me
i
remember
where
and
when
i
had
it
the
two
boys
while
talking
in
this
manner
were
galloping
over
the
level
plain
at
a
fair
clip
bob
was
riding
domino
a
big
black
horse
he
had
brought
with
him
from
the
blue
grass
region
of
kentucky
frank
rode
a
yellow
pony
of
great
endurance
and
wise
beyond
the
average
of
his
class
buckskin
he
was
called
true
to
his
color
and
frank
had
taught
him
many
of
the
tricks
known
to
the
favorite
mounts
of
cowboys
frank
and
bob
were
seen
riding
over
the
country
so
much
that
far
and
wide
they
had
become
known
as
the
some
months
before
the
time
when
they
are
introduced
to
the
reader
in
the
present
volume
they
had
investigated
a
mysterious
noise
that
seemed
to
come
from
a
spur
of
the
great
rocky
mountains
within
twenty
miles
of
circle
ranch
this
queer
rumbling
had
awed
the
indians
for
a
century
or
more
and
they
really
believed
it
to
be
the
voice
of
manitou
what
the
two
lads
saw
and
the
adventures
that
befell
them
on
that
occasion
have
been
related
in
the
first
story
in
this
series
entitled
saddle
boys
in
the
rockies
or
lost
on
thunder
later
on
a
sudden
call
came
for
them
to
go
to
the
wonderful
region
where
the
great
colorado
river
runs
for
some
hundreds
of
miles
through
the
most
astonishing
canyon
in
all
the
world
and
here
they
not
only
saw
strange
sights
but
had
some
lively
times
these
are
narrated
in
the
story
called
saddle
boys
in
the
grand
canyon
or
the
hermit
of
echo
colonel
haywood
was
laid
up
with
a
broken
leg
when
a
summons
came
that
required
his
presence
at
cherry
blossom
mine
so
he
was
compelled
to
ask
the
two
boys
to
go
in
his
stead
this
mine
was
a
most
valuable
property
and
the
disaster
that
hung
over
it
like
a
cloud
gave
the
two
lads
considerable
work
before
they
could
feel
that
they
had
won
out
the
remarkable
things
that
happened
when
on
this
gallop
over
plain
and
desert
and
through
mountain
trails
are
told
of
in
the
third
book
of
this
series
entitled
saddle
boys
on
the
plains
or
after
a
treasure
of
after
passing
through
these
troubles
of
magnitude
here
was
bob
bemoaning
the
loss
of
a
knife
as
though
such
a
little
thing
distressed
him
beyond
measure
was
a
present
you
see
frank
he
said
for
perhaps
the
tenth
time
as
they
rode
along
side
by
side
yes
i
know
replied
frank
as
though
really
getting
quite
tired
of
hearing
about
that
wonderful
knife
girl
you
knew
in
old
kentucky
wanting
to
give
you
a
present
that
you
could
use
out
in
the
wild
and
woolly
west
drew
all
her
pin
money
she
had
saved
and
actually
bought
you
that
fine
hunting
knife
too
bad
that
if
it
was
so
valuable
you
keep
a
closer
watch
on
it
you
said
have
it
you
frank
went
on
the
other
i
take
my
word
for
that
bob
said
frank
you
think
give
it
to
you
if
i
had
it
around
though
for
that
matter
i
think
you
deserve
to
be
punished
a
little
for
being
so
careless
about
a
present
that
a
girl
gave
perhaps
you
could
give
me
a
hint
about
what
i
did
with
it
if
you
cared
to
frank
i
believe
i
could
replied
the
other
slowly
and
in
what
bob
chose
to
consider
a
suspicious
way
remember
after
a
little
perhaps
pop
into
your
mind
as
you
wake
up
in
the
morning
had
things
do
that
a
few
times
but
look
at
that
steer
cavorting
around
over
yonder
whatever
in
the
world
do
you
suppose
doing
bob
the
kentucky
boy
shook
his
head
as
though
still
unsatisfied
reckon
now
frank
might
know
a
little
about
that
knife
he
murmured
to
himself
as
he
looked
at
his
chum
for
some
reason
he
wants
to
play
innocent
and
let
me
think
things
out
and
it
like
frank
to
act
this
way
perhaps
best
keep
quiet
and
watch
him
he
might
give
himself
away
somehow
when
he
on
his
frank
meanwhile
seemed
to
be
really
interested
in
the
actions
of
the
animal
to
which
he
had
called
the
attention
of
his
chum
suppose
we
turn
aside
here
he
remarked
presently
go
a
little
closer
to
that
old
chap
looks
to
me
acting
mighty
queer
see
him
throw
up
the
dirt
and
i
can
hear
him
bellow
from
here
made
him
right
anything
you
say
goes
frank
replied
the
other
suiting
his
actions
to
his
words
and
wheeling
to
the
left
for
the
time
being
he
put
all
thought
of
the
missing
present
from
his
mind
just
as
frank
had
said
the
chances
were
he
would
find
it
again
sooner
or
later
yet
bob
admitted
to
himself
that
it
had
been
a
long
time
since
anything
had
arisen
to
annoy
him
so
much
they
were
now
bearing
down
upon
the
spot
where
the
steer
was
acting
so
strangely
he
circled
around
a
small
patch
of
timber
and
brush
that
was
too
dense
for
him
to
push
through
every
little
while
bellowing
angrily
shaking
his
long
horns
and
giving
every
evidence
of
having
been
worked
up
to
a
pitch
where
he
could
not
contain
himself
me
keeping
close
to
that
of
timber
frank
suggested
bob
as
they
kept
galloping
closer
to
the
spot
what
i
had
in
mind
replied
his
chum
at
him
behaving
as
if
give
anything
to
be
able
to
rush
it
but
no
could
push
through
that
thick
scrub
something
in
the
bunch
that
makes
him
furious
what
frank
went
on
bob
right
bob
anyhow
what
i
was
thinking
it
be
a
rattler
asked
the
kentucky
lad
now
i
hardly
think
a
steer
would
act
that
way
if
it
was
replied
the
youth
who
had
been
brought
up
on
a
ranch
and
knew
a
great
many
things
that
were
as
yet
mysterious
to
a
recent
tenderfoot
like
bob
the
open
some
steers
might
try
and
jump
on
a
snake
that
was
coiled
just
as
seen
a
deer
do
once
grinding
it
to
pieces
under
his
hoofs
but
if
the
snake
got
in
among
the
brush
a
steer
would
let
him
what
can
it
be
queried
the
boy
from
kentucky
sneaking
coyote
that
either
declared
his
chum
decidedly
see
these
old
steers
size
up
a
coyote
as
a
harmless
thing
not
worth
wasting
time
over
now
if
it
were
a
wolf
that
would
be
another
thing
a
steer
hates
a
mountain
wolf
like
poison
seems
like
they
know
how
the
gray
rascal
is
always
hanging
around
waiting
to
pull
down
a
calf
when
the
chance
been
told
declared
bob
related
an
instance
where
a
steer
and
a
wolf
had
a
battle
over
the
body
of
a
heifer
the
robber
had
i
happened
to
see
that
fight
and
the
steer
won
out
too
the
wolf
was
as
mad
as
they
make
and
quit
he
grabbed
the
steer
several
times
by
the
nose
but
hold
on
and
finally
the
steer
managed
to
pin
him
to
the
ground
by
one
horn
after
that
it
was
all
over
with
see
here
frank
supposing
there
is
a
wolf
in
that
bunch
of
timber
and
scrub
been
sneaking
around
thinking
to
get
a
dinner
while
the
cowboys
are
away
on
the
other
side
of
the
ranch
twenty
miles
from
here
but
a
wolf
can
outrun
even
the
fastest
steer
he
reckon
he
can
every
time
admitted
frank
why
this
beast
make
for
his
home
in
the
mountains
tell
me
that
please
persisted
bob
there
might
be
a
reason
his
chum
rejoined
as
he
continued
to
watch
the
actions
of
the
steer
the
first
place
this
might
happen
to
be
a
particularly
bold
wolf
and
having
started
out
to
get
a
dinner
he
hates
to
give
up
the
idea
just
because
a
silly
old
steer
prances
around
his
hiding
place
and
dares
him
to
come
out
into
the
there
might
be
another
reason
pursued
bob
always
eager
to
learn
it
is
a
wolf
frank
continued
might
happen
to
be
lame
and
not
feel
like
taking
chances
on
the
open
with
a
lively
old
steer
that
would
explain
it
you
anyway
soon
know
because
nearly
there
the
other
remarked
as
he
reached
around
to
unfasten
his
repeating
rifle
from
the
saddle
where
he
often
carried
it
rather
than
over
his
back
by
means
of
a
strap
before
we
leave
here
going
to
be
a
hard
winter
for
wolf
if
making
the
trouble
if
he
runs
the
steer
will
catch
up
with
him
and
if
he
stays
a
bit
of
lead
between
his
ribs
sorry
for
him
frank
but
i
reckon
been
responsible
for
more
than
a
few
heifers
that
have
disappeared
mysteriously
from
time
to
so
replied
frank
hate
wolves
anything
on
four
legs
only
one
thing
that
hits
you
mean
frank
remarked
the
kentucky
boy
the
mexicans
or
halfbreeds
who
drop
down
on
a
herd
of
cattle
or
the
saddle
band
of
the
horses
and
disappear
with
them
and
of
all
the
rustlers
in
arizona
none
equal
to
pedro
mendoza
look
at
the
steer
bob
to
just
know
coming
to
lend
a
helping
hand
laughed
bob
he
gallops
around
to
the
other
side
of
the
timber
as
if
he
wanted
to
cut
off
wolf
before
he
took
a
start
from
that
side
a
sharp
one
that
smarter
and
i
ought
to
know
because
old
baldy
remarked
frank
cried
bob
you
tell
me
a
long
time
ago
that
old
baldy
had
been
nipped
with
a
bunch
of
cattle
and
your
foreman
believed
the
rustlers
had
him
what
we
felt
sure
of
and
i
believe
it
yet
frank
said
all
the
same
i
think
mistaken
when
i
say
our
old
baldy
come
back
as
straight
as
he
he
broke
out
of
some
corral
in
the
mountains
where
the
rustlers
were
keeping
him
penned
up
and
took
the
home
trail
on
the
gallop
suggested
bob
frank
remarked
on
see
if
his
brand
has
been
altered
because
that
would
tell
the
story
but
turn
off
here
bob
and
cover
as
much
ground
as
we
can
have
your
gun
handy
and
if
the
wolf
vamooses
give
him
a
little
start
then
have
a
bully
gallop
and
see
who
will
be
the
first
to
nail
him
whoop
something
doing
right
now
bob
chapter
ii
one
gray
thief
less
he
goes
and
it
is
a
wolf
sure
pop
frank
shouted
bob
if
you
look
close
remarked
his
chum
see
that
he
wobbles
just
a
little
with
that
left
hind
leg
of
his
reckon
he
got
a
thorn
in
his
paw
or
cut
it
on
a
sharp
rock
after
him
bob
they
gave
the
horses
free
rein
both
animals
were
comparatively
fresh
and
eager
for
a
mad
gallop
over
the
open
country
that
cool
day
in
the
fall
the
steer
did
not
seem
to
have
sighted
the
fleeing
wolf
or
else
must
have
decided
that
with
the
two
mounted
boys
in
swift
pursuit
there
was
little
need
of
his
exerting
himself
to
overtake
the
hated
enemy
at
any
rate
he
remained
in
the
vicinity
of
the
timber
as
though
bent
on
keeping
the
animal
from
again
seeking
refuge
there
heading
for
that
swale
near
the
rocky
point
and
if
he
reaches
it
have
a
hard
time
getting
him
exclaimed
bob
after
a
few
minutes
of
racing
worry
he
going
to
get
there
said
frank
overhauling
him
right
now
look
at
him
run
lame
or
not
he
can
lope
along
as
well
as
any
wolf
i
ever
chased
he
knows
running
for
his
life
the
sly
varmint
and
he
has
hopes
of
giving
us
the
can
see
him
look
back
every
little
while
frank
bob
remarked
as
he
bent
low
in
the
saddle
and
felt
his
pulses
thrill
with
the
excitement
of
the
chase
do
you
suppose
he
does
that
for
for
the
flash
of
the
smoke
of
a
gun
perhaps
came
the
reply
of
these
old
prowlers
are
as
wise
as
they
make
the
boys
declare
they
can
dodge
a
bullet
if
they
happen
to
be
looking
back
when
you
fire
remember
that
bob
and
be
ready
to
shoot
at
the
drop
of
the
hat
after
let
loose
perhaps
we
can
catch
him
napping
that
bob
was
aware
that
he
had
much
to
learn
about
shooting
while
on
the
full
gallop
still
he
would
like
to
make
a
try
if
he
failed
then
rather
than
see
the
wolf
escape
he
meant
to
be
the
one
to
take
first
shot
and
let
frank
try
to
nip
the
gray
robber
of
the
herds
before
he
could
recover
already
had
they
decreased
by
and
more
the
lead
with
which
the
fleeing
animal
had
started
things
were
getting
serious
with
the
wolf
now
his
observations
became
more
frequent
evidently
he
expected
that
at
any
moment
firing
might
begin
and
he
wanted
to
be
ready
to
dodge
about
it
now
frank
asked
the
kentucky
boy
as
he
held
his
rifle
in
readiness
for
instant
use
might
give
him
a
try
came
the
reply
and
as
he
spoke
frank
threw
his
gun
up
to
his
shoulder
allowing
the
bridle
to
fall
upon
the
neck
of
buckskin
the
sharp
report
of
the
weapon
sounded
but
apparently
there
was
no
result
quickly
after
the
first
shot
came
a
second
bob
had
pulled
trigger
too
but
the
fleeing
wolf
did
not
show
the
least
sign
of
having
been
struck
missed
him
clean
frank
cried
bob
in
dismay
thought
be
smart
enough
to
hit
such
a
flying
target
while
going
at
this
pace
but
frank
you
were
right
i
plainly
saw
him
dodge
when
you
shot
give
him
another
round
then
and
see
if
you
can
do
better
ready
let
him
have
it
yelled
bob
eagerly
his
sporting
instinct
now
fully
aroused
again
did
frank
fire
and
seeing
that
the
gray
animal
was
still
bounding
along
uninjured
bob
in
turn
discharged
his
gun
shooting
what
he
exclaimed
mean
mine
of
course
frank
and
now
just
got
to
take
your
you
say
so
all
right
answered
the
other
ought
to
be
done
because
getting
closer
to
that
swale
all
the
time
and
i
say
be
a
shame
if
the
old
wolf
got
clean
away
through
trickery
ready
frank
her
go
bob
took
a
quick
aim
at
the
animal
and
fired
of
course
he
had
not
the
remotest
idea
of
hitting
the
wolf
but
by
causing
him
to
dodge
it
would
open
the
way
for
his
more
experienced
chum
to
get
in
a
shot
when
the
beast
was
off
his
guard
the
report
of
gun
came
so
close
upon
that
of
his
own
that
bob
could
hardly
believe
there
had
been
two
shots
yet
he
had
seen
that
the
wolf
kept
on
after
his
discharge
it
was
different
when
frank
shot
his
bolt
you
got
him
that
time
frank
shouted
bob
with
great
glee
dropped
in
his
tracks
as
sure
as
anything
tried
that
trick
just
once
too
often
he
look
at
him
kicking
his
last
paying
now
for
the
veal
he
carried
off
all
these
years
the
villain
frank
laughed
for
he
felt
particularly
well
pleased
because
the
wolf
had
been
kept
from
reaching
the
rocks
where
he
might
have
eluded
them
they
drew
rein
and
looked
down
at
the
now
motionless
form
of
the
gaunt
animal
even
in
death
the
big
wolf
had
a
sinister
appearance
for
the
lips
were
drawn
back
exposing
his
cruel
fangs
hate
to
meet
a
critter
like
that
alone
and
without
a
knife
to
defend
myself
with
frank
bob
exclaimed
as
he
sat
in
the
saddle
pushing
several
cartridges
into
the
magazine
of
his
rifle
and
looking
down
at
the
hated
quarry
that
had
rewarded
last
shot
an
old
one
all
right
remarked
frank
can
see
the
scars
of
many
a
fight
on
his
hide
and
about
his
muzzle
but
wait
till
i
fling
him
across
the
horse
watch
buckskin
prance
no
horse
likes
to
come
in
touch
with
a
wild
animal
like
a
panther
wolf
or
bear
dead
or
alive
the
scent
of
blood
makes
wild
too
whoa
buckskin
be
so
funny
now
just
got
to
carry
this
chap
back
to
the
ranch
because
i
want
dad
to
see
we
head
toward
home
now
remarked
bob
but
by
way
of
that
timber
i
want
to
take
a
look
at
old
baldy
when
the
boys
hear
of
his
return
be
some
tall
talking
he
used
to
give
heaps
of
trouble
in
the
past
yet
they
all
liked
the
old
chap
and
when
he
disappeared
in
company
with
a
dozen
head
of
stock
there
was
more
range
riding
to
find
him
than
i
ever
heard
baldy
is
waiting
for
us
remarked
bob
like
he
just
knew
what
we
went
for
and
he
wants
to
see
what
luck
we
a
smart
one
all
right
laughed
frank
if
those
rustlers
have
had
him
penned
up
all
this
while
managed
to
break
out
at
last
and
come
it
be
a
great
stunt
now
if
some
of
the
boys
could
follow
his
trail
back
to
where
he
was
kept
in
a
corral
that
would
tell
us
frank
just
how
pedro
mendoza
manages
to
disappear
whenever
he
runs
a
bunch
of
cattle
perhaps
it
might
be
done
yet
impossible
as
it
seems
observed
frank
makes
you
say
so
demanded
the
other
see
old
baldy
has
a
marked
hoof
frank
went
on
from
those
of
other
steers
you
mean
asked
his
chum
got
a
queer
twist
that
makes
it
look
much
longer
than
his
other
hoofs
the
boys
all
know
it
too
spanish
joe
used
to
say
the
animal
must
have
got
caught
in
a
cleft
of
the
rocks
when
small
and
his
hoof
grew
that
frank
could
any
cowboy
track
old
baldy
all
the
way
across
plain
and
desert
to
the
mountains
if
he
came
from
there
perhaps
all
of
forty
miles
ordinary
conditions
say
no
frank
answered
promptly
you
remember
that
we
had
a
rain
two
days
ago
which
is
quite
remarkable
for
this
country
that
laid
the
alkali
dust
and
eyes
trained
to
that
sort
of
thing
might
do
wonders
but
that
have
to
put
up
to
dad
and
bart
heminway
the
foreman
of
circle
old
baldy
looking
to
see
if
you
got
the
wolf
remarked
bob
the
old
steer
did
indeed
seem
to
be
beset
with
curiosity
standing
there
with
head
thrust
out
he
was
sniffing
the
air
as
though
possibly
the
scent
of
blood
came
to
his
nostrils
frank
tossed
the
body
of
the
wolf
down
on
the
ground
and
then
with
his
chum
rode
back
a
little
distance
to
see
what
the
steer
would
do
going
up
to
smell
of
the
wolf
frank
exclaimed
the
kentucky
boy
what
he
is
echoed
frank
as
he
watched
the
big
beast
approach
and
finally
bend
his
horned
head
to
sniff
at
the
robber
who
had
in
times
past
stolen
many
a
calf
and
partly
grown
heifer
from
the
herd
as
the
animals
grazed
in
some
dangerous
spot
about
the
brand
has
it
been
changed
asked
bob
seeing
the
flank
of
the
returned
steer
turned
toward
them
been
burned
out
entirely
but
no
new
one
made
yet
frank
replied
was
that
do
you
suppose
frank
old
baldy
was
too
much
for
the
mexican
ropers
the
other
answered
they
just
had
to
give
up
the
idea
of
putting
another
brand
on
him
then
again
if
spanish
joe
or
his
nephew
abajo
happened
to
be
in
the
bunch
of
rustlers
they
would
recognize
old
baldy
and
warn
the
others
that
it
would
be
dangerous
to
try
and
slip
him
through
no
matter
here
he
is
right
side
up
with
care
and
as
ready
as
ever
to
do
at
him
going
to
horn
the
dead
wolf
said
bob
spoil
the
skin
for
you
frank
if
you
watch
i
care
much
about
that
frank
remarked
an
old
and
sunburned
pelt
at
best
but
like
dad
to
see
the
thief
intact
so
ride
forward
and
induce
old
baldy
to
stop
his
the
steer
retreated
at
their
advance
still
shaking
his
head
threateningly
as
though
not
quite
convinced
that
he
had
better
keep
the
peace
possibly
he
recognized
frank
as
an
old
acquaintance
and
was
so
rejoiced
to
be
back
again
amid
the
associations
of
his
earlier
years
that
he
decided
not
to
attack
them
had
he
tried
anything
of
the
sort
he
would
have
rued
the
day
because
frank
could
throw
the
rope
as
well
as
any
cowboy
and
he
would
speedily
have
rolled
old
baldy
over
on
his
back
once
again
the
dead
wolf
was
tossed
across
the
back
of
the
plunging
buckskin
pony
no
matter
how
well
trained
a
horse
may
be
he
will
never
become
accustomed
to
the
presence
of
a
beast
of
prey
even
circus
horses
show
their
nervousness
after
drawing
a
cage
containing
a
tiger
or
a
lion
for
weeks
and
months
at
a
time
old
baldy
trotted
along
after
them
as
they
rode
off
proves
he
was
on
his
way
home
when
he
scented
that
lame
wolf
and
perhaps
chased
him
into
that
bunch
of
timber
remarked
frank
as
he
turned
in
the
saddle
and
saw
the
following
steer
they
soon
sighted
the
buildings
of
circle
ranch
trees
gave
a
grateful
shade
in
places
but
from
far
off
on
the
plain
a
traveler
could
catch
glimpses
of
the
home
of
the
haywoods
and
the
headquarters
of
the
largest
in
all
arizona
when
the
two
boys
drew
up
in
front
of
the
ranch
house
they
found
father
sitting
in
a
chair
on
the
piazza
he
had
not
as
yet
fully
recovered
from
his
broken
leg
frank
back
again
so
soon
he
called
out
as
the
boys
drew
rein
and
jumped
to
the
ground
brought
you
back
in
such
a
hurry
and
it
seemed
to
me
i
heard
some
sort
of
firing
away
out
to
windward
was
that
you
what
it
was
dad
replied
frank
were
chasing
a
wolf
and
trying
to
beat
him
at
dodging
he
was
an
old
chap
but
after
a
few
trials
we
knocked
him
over
and
never
pull
down
another
calf
for
wish
we
could
get
rid
of
all
our
troubles
as
easily
as
that
frank
remarked
colonel
haywood
as
he
glanced
at
the
dead
animal
which
his
boy
dragged
up
near
the
steps
of
the
piazza
never
would
have
seen
him
i
reckon
sir
bob
spoke
for
a
steer
that
had
him
cornered
in
a
little
bunch
of
timber
and
brush
and
was
daring
him
to
come
out
frank
guessed
the
wolf
might
be
a
little
lame
which
was
why
he
appear
that
proved
to
be
so
when
we
scared
him
into
running
but
frank
nailed
him
all
right
you
may
be
him
just
back
of
the
foreleg
when
he
turned
aside
at
my
shot
a
trick
i
hope
to
learn
some
a
steer
held
him
up
eh
went
on
the
stockman
often
any
of
them
will
do
that
you
can
expect
anything
of
old
baldy
remarked
frank
quietly
the
stockman
started
and
showed
great
interest
that
frank
he
exclaimed
baldy
come
back
again
after
we
believed
the
rustlers
got
him
some
interesting
news
now
the
boys
will
be
tickled
to
know
that
and
perhaps
old
baldy
may
help
us
locate
mendoza
the
secret
corral
chapter
iii
the
alarm
bell
long
has
old
baldy
been
gone
now
dad
asked
frank
of
a
month
positive
replied
the
stockman
i
remember
now
that
we
missed
a
round
dozen
head
at
the
time
followed
their
tracks
for
several
miles
and
then
they
seemed
to
disappear
in
the
low
swale
back
of
purple
sage
mesa
we
never
got
a
trace
of
them
again
some
of
the
boys
jumped
to
the
conclusion
that
they
were
caught
in
that
quicksand
but
i
never
could
quite
believe
old
baldy
would
forget
all
his
cunning
like
always
stuck
to
it
that
the
bunch
was
driven
off
by
men
cunning
enough
to
hide
their
trail
you
dad
frank
continued
what
i
have
said
colonel
haywood
emphatically
now
that
you
tell
me
the
old
fellow
has
shown
up
again
more
set
on
that
explanation
than
proof
that
old
baldy
has
been
in
other
hands
all
this
time
remarked
frank
nodding
his
head
convincingly
mean
his
brand
has
been
changed
exclaimed
the
stockman
eagerly
that
ought
to
tell
us
who
took
him
i
hope
son
you
found
the
arrow
brand
there
nor
yet
the
mark
of
the
syndicate
hate
to
think
any
decent
rancher
could
be
guilty
of
such
a
thing
for
spite
is
dad
laughed
frank
a
sign
of
a
new
mark
on
the
flank
of
old
baldy
somebody
took
the
pains
to
wipe
out
our
brand
all
right
but
they
have
the
nerve
to
continue
the
work
i
reckon
that
old
baldy
just
tore
around
so
they
had
to
let
him
severely
i
wonder
chuckled
the
stockman
who
had
known
the
tough
old
steer
to
do
many
queer
things
in
his
time
wonder
is
they
put
a
bullet
in
him
and
end
his
loping
but
i
must
go
out
and
see
our
old
friend
when
he
shows
up
you
think
he
was
on
the
way
here
you
frank
he
was
continued
the
boy
he
caught
a
whiff
of
that
lame
wolf
and
set
up
a
siege
by
the
little
bunch
of
timber
give
him
half
an
hour
and
see
him
show
up
at
the
cattle
corral
acting
just
as
if
never
been
be
some
high
old
jinks
played
around
there
remarked
bob
baldy
used
to
be
the
great
mogul
i
remember
and
since
he
disappeared
several
candidates
have
bobbed
up
to
take
his
have
to
beat
the
lot
of
before
proved
his
right
to
his
old
position
of
boss
declared
frank
sure
do
it
echoed
bob
way
he
acted
out
there
on
the
plain
proved
that
even
a
vacation
taken
any
of
the
ginger
and
spirit
out
of
the
old
chap
why
i
guess
that
tough
his
flesh
would
turn
the
edge
of
a
hunting
is
any
ordinary
blade
and
bob
sighed
as
he
spoke
frank
knew
that
he
was
thinking
once
more
of
the
mystery
concerning
the
disappearance
of
his
own
knife
which
he
valued
so
highly
and
thought
without
an
equal
some
of
the
cowboys
connected
with
the
circle
ranch
came
galloping
in
just
then
they
were
grinning
as
though
wonderfully
pleased
over
something
a
fact
the
boys
with
colonel
haywood
noticed
immediately
to
one
on
remarked
bob
upon
seeing
the
three
punchers
make
a
for
the
piazza
as
though
each
wanted
to
be
the
first
to
communicate
some
pleasing
information
come
back
colonel
yelled
one
from
afar
that
sly
old
baldy
he
means
called
a
second
he
is
for
the
corral
right
now
whooped
the
third
not
wanting
to
be
left
entirely
out
of
the
game
our
been
burned
off
sure
declared
the
leader
as
he
reached
the
steps
thar
ye
seem
to
be
a
heap
boys
it
no
news
after
all
slinging
look
at
frank
grin
a
cinch
been
ahead
of
us
of
course
after
that
frank
had
to
own
up
and
relate
the
story
of
how
old
baldy
had
made
the
lame
wolf
take
to
cover
and
held
him
there
until
help
came
for
old
baldy
the
same
game
chap
as
before
he
was
took
exclaimed
jeff
davis
and
then
led
his
comrades
in
a
series
of
cheers
for
the
returned
wanderer
who
had
finally
made
his
way
home
after
adventures
which
might
never
be
more
than
guessed
at
an
exciting
debate
followed
but
when
all
had
given
their
opinion
it
was
found
that
suspicion
centred
on
pedro
mendoza
as
the
guilty
one
this
mexican
had
long
been
a
thorn
in
the
flesh
of
the
ranchers
of
arizona
he
led
a
band
of
bold
lawless
spirits
who
seemed
able
to
appear
and
vanish
in
a
manner
that
baffled
all
search
as
a
rule
the
rustlers
had
not
annoyed
the
circle
ranch
people
confining
their
operations
to
ranges
more
distant
nevertheless
the
stockmen
had
grumbled
considerably
about
the
way
these
frequent
outrages
took
away
from
the
profits
of
raising
cattle
and
only
for
the
petty
jealousies
between
them
they
must
have
united
long
ago
in
a
determined
effort
to
rid
the
country
once
and
for
all
of
such
a
bad
character
as
mendoza
colonel
haywood
and
his
foreman
had
often
talked
the
matter
over
they
had
even
laid
out
a
plan
of
campaign
to
be
followed
in
case
they
awoke
some
morning
to
find
that
the
rustlers
had
visited
the
herds
of
circle
ranch
at
the
time
the
dozen
head
had
vanished
old
baldy
among
them
opinions
had
differed
so
widely
that
nothing
was
done
since
no
trail
could
be
found
beyond
a
certain
point
the
boys
had
concluded
that
the
quicksand
was
responsible
for
the
wholesale
disappearance
at
other
times
a
single
cow
had
been
engulfed
and
on
the
face
of
it
this
theory
appeared
plausible
though
colonel
haywood
had
never
been
fully
convinced
himself
concerning
its
truth
but
at
the
time
he
had
been
laid
up
with
a
broken
leg
and
as
he
would
wish
to
be
at
the
head
of
any
expedition
formed
for
the
purpose
of
hunting
the
shrewd
rustlers
to
their
hiding
place
it
was
finally
allowed
to
drop
but
the
anger
of
the
circle
ranch
cow
punchers
only
slept
the
return
of
old
baldy
with
the
mark
of
a
fresh
burn
on
his
flank
blotting
out
the
circle
that
had
stamped
him
as
the
property
of
colonel
haywood
was
the
match
that
once
more
started
the
smouldering
blaze
there
was
more
or
less
excited
talk
in
the
that
night
concerning
the
necessity
for
some
prompt
action
with
regard
to
ridding
the
country
of
the
rustlers
who
had
so
long
had
things
their
own
way
even
the
stockman
seemed
to
have
the
subject
on
his
mind
for
as
he
sat
with
the
two
boys
and
bart
heminway
on
the
piazza
after
supper
with
the
moon
just
rising
in
the
eastern
heavens
and
the
many
noises
of
the
night
adding
to
the
drowsy
feeling
he
referred
to
the
loss
of
the
entire
saddle
band
of
horses
sustained
by
a
ranch
located
some
twenty
miles
away
on
cibiou
creek
been
thinking
some
over
that
matter
frank
he
continued
i
was
kept
here
idle
with
this
game
leg
and
putting
this
and
that
together
i
reached
a
certain
conclusion
fact
is
about
made
up
my
mind
i
know
where
that
mendoza
crowd
of
rustlers
must
hold
so
dad
remarked
frank
sure
please
a
lot
of
people
a
heap
if
you
could
show
been
hunting
high
and
low
these
three
years
and
more
for
that
secret
cache
where
pedro
hides
his
stolen
cattle
and
horses
would
you
mind
telling
bob
and
me
about
it
is
frank
the
rancher
went
on
were
the
one
to
give
me
my
i
get
on
to
what
you
mean
sir
remarked
frank
referring
to
what
bob
and
myself
saw
that
time
we
were
on
our
way
to
find
out
what
made
the
queer
growling
and
sounds
on
that
mountain
what
i
mean
nodded
colonel
haywood
remember
you
told
me
that
when
you
were
camped
in
the
dark
near
the
beginning
of
the
canyon
you
were
startled
to
hear
the
thud
of
many
hoofs
and
looking
out
saw
a
troop
pass
by
many
of
the
animals
being
led
by
unknown
frank
went
on
quickly
at
the
time
bob
and
myself
just
kept
quiet
and
they
never
suspected
we
were
anywhere
near
you
see
we
make
sure
at
the
time
whether
they
were
some
cow
punchers
from
a
ranch
taking
home
some
new
stock
and
making
use
of
the
canyon
over
thunder
mountain
as
a
to
the
country
beyond
or
the
rustlers
and
as
we
lost
any
saddle
band
just
then
we
care
to
mix
near
as
i
can
figure
out
frank
it
was
that
night
or
the
one
before
when
the
raid
was
made
on
that
cibiou
creek
ranch
and
the
more
i
think
of
it
the
firmer
grows
my
conviction
that
over
beyond
thunder
mountain
somewhere
mendoza
has
his
hidden
corral
in
some
lost
valley
none
of
us
know
anything
about
as
you
say
dad
the
chances
look
that
way
frank
admitted
if
circle
ranch
meets
with
a
loss
any
of
these
fine
mornings
where
have
to
look
to
recover
our
stock
it
may
come
sooner
than
any
of
us
think
and
dad
even
if
the
or
the
arrowhead
that
stands
the
next
loss
you
think
all
better
sink
our
differences
and
unite
against
the
common
enemy
had
made
up
my
mind
to
that
frank
replied
the
stockman
firmly
time
for
our
fall
is
now
close
at
hand
and
the
way
things
look
we
ought
to
make
a
good
showing
unless
something
unforseen
drops
down
on
us
they
say
we
have
the
finest
herds
in
the
whole
section
and
the
branding
before
winter
sets
in
ought
to
be
the
biggest
and
just
the
reason
we
may
be
the
next
one
to
suffer
at
the
hands
of
mendoza
observed
frank
say
he
keeps
tabs
on
all
the
ranches
and
even
has
many
spies
in
that
way
he
knows
about
the
condition
of
the
herds
and
makes
his
plans
so
carefully
that
he
never
was
known
to
carry
away
anything
but
the
very
you
say
about
spies
has
occurred
to
me
more
than
once
remarked
the
rancher
even
thought
it
possible
that
he
might
have
one
of
his
friends
here
but
hard
to
suspect
any
of
our
boys
all
seemed
so
faithful
in
the
other
days
now
there
was
spanish
joe
and
his
nephew
abajo
both
of
whom
i
felt
sure
had
communication
with
mendoza
i
was
glad
to
be
rid
of
the
greasers
still
there
may
be
some
one
at
circle
ranch
who
sends
word
on
the
sly
to
the
would
be
a
bad
thing
for
him
if
the
boys
ever
learned
of
his
treachery
declared
bob
either
tar
and
feather
him
said
frank
grimly
else
put
it
out
of
his
power
to
send
any
more
messages
but
i
hope
it
so
dad
just
now
with
such
fine
prospects
before
us
and
as
you
say
the
fall
at
hand
got
to
be
more
watchful
than
usual
over
our
herds
son
colonel
haywood
said
in
a
convincing
way
made
up
my
mind
that
the
last
one
let
our
cattle
stay
away
on
the
range
got
three
big
bunches
out
now
with
two
boys
to
act
as
night
wranglers
for
each
herd
true
but
miles
away
from
here
if
anything
swooped
down
on
those
steers
we
know
it
for
gradually
the
conversation
took
a
different
turn
and
before
the
two
boys
went
in
to
sleep
they
had
for
the
time
being
quite
forgotten
the
fears
of
the
early
evening
by
ten
everything
seemed
quiet
and
peaceful
around
the
ranch
house
over
where
the
punchers
bunked
one
cowboy
was
playing
a
banjo
and
there
was
some
little
singing
but
by
degrees
even
this
died
away
the
moon
sailed
high
overhead
in
a
clear
sky
midnight
came
and
went
a
touch
of
coolness
in
the
air
told
of
coming
fall
though
as
a
rule
winter
was
not
a
time
to
be
much
feared
in
this
warm
section
of
the
southwest
even
if
did
blow
in
upon
them
occasionally
that
caught
the
herds
on
the
range
and
brought
about
some
loss
of
stock
bob
had
been
dreaming
of
his
kentucky
home
as
he
often
did
perhaps
with
some
of
his
boyhood
comrades
he
may
have
been
visiting
the
hole
and
amid
much
whooping
was
engaged
in
one
of
the
mud
battles
that
marked
those
visits
then
again
he
may
have
dreamed
that
he
was
once
more
climbing
the
tower
of
the
church
in
the
dead
of
night
dispatched
by
his
companions
to
ring
the
bell
and
startle
the
village
out
of
sleep
he
sat
up
in
bed
to
find
frank
shaking
him
yes
a
bell
was
certainly
ringing
furiously
enough
but
it
belonged
to
no
church
up
and
fling
some
clothes
on
bob
frank
was
saying
the
matter
house
afire
gasped
bob
a
little
dazed
still
even
as
he
started
to
follow
the
directions
of
his
energetic
chum
know
replied
the
hurrying
frank
i
hear
dad
shouting
out
there
rousing
the
can
catch
their
whoops
now
guns
i
wonder
what
it
all
means
ejaculated
bob
shivering
with
excitement
chapter
iv
when
the
rustlers
came
bob
archer
always
believed
that
he
made
record
time
in
getting
dressed
that
night
just
how
long
it
took
him
he
never
knew
but
frank
seemed
to
vie
with
him
in
speed
for
they
rushed
out
together
one
glance
overhead
told
frank
that
it
was
not
far
from
morning
the
position
of
the
moon
in
the
sky
gave
the
prairie
boy
that
information
possibly
bob
would
never
had
thought
of
looking
aloft
had
he
wished
to
know
how
the
night
was
passing
all
his
life
he
had
depended
on
watches
and
clocks
which
might
go
wrong
whereas
celestial
timepiece
was
always
trustworthy
there
certainly
was
much
excitement
about
the
ranch
buildings
just
then
cow
punchers
half
dressed
were
pouring
out
of
the
shouting
everyone
according
to
his
taste
like
bob
most
of
them
believed
that
the
alarm
must
mean
that
a
fire
had
broken
out
and
quick
work
would
be
needed
to
get
the
flames
under
control
their
astonishment
at
not
discovering
a
red
glare
would
have
been
amusing
only
that
the
two
saddle
boys
realized
the
occasion
must
be
serious
above
all
the
other
sounds
the
voice
of
colonel
haywood
could
be
heard
he
was
on
the
piazza
of
the
ranch
house
and
calling
to
the
men
to
come
to
him
immediately
there
seemed
to
be
half
a
score
of
cowboys
gathering
around
just
below
where
the
stockman
stood
evidently
the
colonel
too
had
been
suddenly
aroused
from
sleep
for
he
was
only
partly
dressed
frank
could
not
remember
ever
having
seen
his
father
so
alarmed
perhaps
by
this
time
frank
was
able
to
give
half
a
guess
as
to
the
cause
for
the
commotion
in
this
he
was
aided
by
the
fact
that
his
father
was
not
alone
seated
in
one
of
the
easy
chairs
was
a
figure
it
was
that
of
a
man
and
frank
felt
sure
he
could
recognize
andy
lane
one
of
the
cow
punchers
who
had
been
left
out
on
the
range
as
a
night
wrangler
to
watch
the
herds
that
were
quartered
miles
away
from
the
big
corral
something
then
must
evidently
have
happened
to
bring
andy
home
he
undoubtedly
brought
serious
news
that
had
inflamed
the
mind
of
the
usually
cool
rancher
and
would
account
for
his
excited
manner
frank
looked
further
he
was
accustomed
to
seeing
things
that
might
escape
many
another
less
observing
to
his
mind
andy
was
breathing
very
hard
and
he
looked
as
though
he
might
have
passed
through
a
recent
disturbance
of
some
sort
immediately
the
boy
remembered
the
conversation
he
had
had
with
his
father
concerning
a
possible
descent
of
the
rustlers
on
one
of
their
choice
herds
had
such
a
catastrophe
really
happened
would
that
account
for
the
disturbed
appearance
of
the
cowboy
who
had
been
left
out
on
the
range
to
watch
the
cattle
is
it
colonel
demanded
one
of
the
assembled
punchers
all
here
and
we
want
to
know
called
another
eagerly
andy
boys
thar
he
looks
mighty
bad
used
up
shouted
a
third
at
which
deep
murmurs
arose
as
a
suspicion
of
the
truth
began
to
break
in
upon
the
minds
of
the
wild
riders
of
the
range
come
down
on
us
at
last
boys
said
colonel
haywood
trying
to
master
his
emotion
though
frank
could
detect
an
unaccustomed
tremor
in
his
voice
and
saw
that
his
face
was
white
with
suppressed
passion
rustlers
those
two
words
seemed
to
start
at
one
end
of
the
and
pass
along
from
mouth
to
mouth
there
was
a
bitterness
in
the
way
they
were
spoken
which
told
better
than
anything
else
how
deep
was
the
detestation
the
circle
cowboys
entertained
for
the
stealers
of
horses
and
cattle
and
his
crowd
have
been
on
the
watch
continued
the
stockman
saw
that
we
were
in
the
prize
class
this
fall
with
the
best
herds
they
waited
for
the
right
time
to
strike
another
night
and
our
herds
would
have
been
safe
in
the
big
corral
up
to
the
time
of
the
mendoza
knew
all
about
it
he
must
have
had
word
from
some
spy
who
visits
around
the
ranches
and
he
got
what
he
came
after
boys
a
chorus
of
angry
exclamations
interrupted
the
stockman
he
held
up
his
hand
to
signal
for
silence
again
and
then
went
on
know
that
andy
was
left
in
charge
of
the
pick
of
our
stock
this
night
out
on
the
best
grass
with
clem
stiles
to
help
he
rapped
on
the
window
of
my
room
and
woke
me
up
he
was
covered
with
dust
and
blood
before
he
said
a
single
word
i
just
knew
what
had
happened
before
andy
had
half
told
me
i
was
dressed
and
ringing
the
alarm
bell
andy
speak
up
and
let
the
boys
know
what
dropped
down
on
you
the
dilapidated
figure
that
had
been
lying
back
in
the
chair
managed
to
struggle
to
his
feet
although
he
had
been
badly
used
andy
was
still
full
of
grit
it
takes
a
good
deal
to
put
a
genuine
cowboy
down
for
good
sneaked
in
on
us
all
right
boys
he
said
would
thought
it
could
been
played
on
me
thataways
but
they
sure
caught
us
first
thing
we
knowed
we
was
pounced
on
by
a
bunch
of
fellers
that
had
ther
handkerchiefs
tied
the
lower
part
of
their
faces
we
kicked
good
and
hard
me
clem
but
what
was
the
use
they
was
four
to
one
agin
us
and
it
long
before
we
was
both
done
ye
know
any
of
andy
called
out
ted
conway
a
one
replied
the
other
you
see
it
was
only
moonlight
and
them
rags
over
their
faces
did
the
business
besides
we
was
hurted
a
heap
by
the
time
the
racket
was
over
they
tied
us
like
a
couple
of
roped
steers
and
left
us
lie
there
not
whether
we
bleeded
to
death
or
they
ran
the
stock
away
did
they
andy
asked
one
of
the
listeners
heard
get
busy
while
we
wrestled
with
the
ropes
continued
the
other
taken
our
guns
along
and
our
hosses
too
as
we
laid
thar
we
could
hear
the
herd
get
under
way
and
the
style
them
rustlers
did
things
it
was
clean
easy
to
see
every
one
of
had
been
a
honest
cow
puncher
in
his
time
reckon
that
in
half
an
hour
arter
we
was
keeled
over
i
heard
the
last
of
the
hoofs
of
the
herd
pass
long
ago
was
that
andy
asked
the
colonel
a
been
midnight
when
they
kim
down
on
us
sir
replied
the
other
then
what
did
you
and
clem
do
pursued
the
stockman
who
was
by
degrees
becoming
more
collected
as
he
realized
that
if
ever
he
needed
a
cool
head
the
time
was
now
was
like
a
house
afire
to
git
my
hands
loose
colonel
andy
continued
i
knowed
was
hurted
worse
nor
me
for
he
said
he
believed
his
ankle
must
a
been
broke
once
i
get
him
to
answer
then
i
reckoned
as
how
poor
clem
had
fainted
from
the
got
loose
in
the
end
andy
sure
did
after
workin
it
seemed
for
hours
clem
was
able
to
talk
again
but
after
i
managed
to
get
his
rope
off
stood
him
up
we
seen
it
was
no
go
he
walk
a
step
so
i
says
as
how
have
to
make
the
run
in
alone
i
reckon
i
must
a
lost
some
blood
myself
know
what
else
made
me
feel
so
weak
every
little
while
must
a
took
me
a
age
to
git
here
sorry
i
done
it
better
colonel
haywood
was
just
in
time
to
catch
the
falling
figure
of
andy
the
poor
fellow
was
indeed
so
weakened
from
all
he
had
gone
through
besides
the
loss
of
blood
from
his
several
wounds
that
he
had
fainted
no
shouts
arose
from
the
gathered
cowboys
their
feelings
were
too
deep
just
then
for
utterance
as
the
late
vidette
was
carried
into
the
ranch
house
the
employees
of
circle
ranch
clustered
there
talking
in
low
but
significant
tones
in
and
finish
dressing
said
bart
heminway
the
energetic
foreman
come
back
here
again
to
take
orders
and
be
sure
you
carry
plenty
of
ammunition
it
may
be
needed
before
through
with
this
business
for
take
it
from
me
boys
the
circle
ranch
is
to
get
back
that
herd
if
pedro
mendoza
has
to
be
chased
away
down
across
the
border
into
frank
and
bob
followed
suit
when
they
came
out
again
bearing
their
repeating
rifles
and
dressed
for
a
long
ride
they
found
every
fellow
once
more
on
the
spot
only
waiting
for
the
colonel
to
say
the
word
need
of
any
hurry
boys
said
the
stockman
who
had
evidently
been
making
his
plans
while
completing
his
own
dressing
get
that
herd
away
as
fast
as
we
can
follow
first
our
duty
to
bring
in
the
other
two
herds
and
make
sure
of
right
colonel
called
one
cowboy
joke
be
on
us
to
have
drop
down
and
get
the
rest
of
the
stock
while
we
was
for
get
away
and
see
that
every
animal
is
safe
in
the
big
corral
by
morning
afterward
settle
on
our
plan
and
rest
easy
boys
this
time
nothing
is
going
to
keep
us
from
running
down
rustlers
they
believe
be
able
to
hoodwink
us
again
but
wait
and
see
perhaps
they
can
but
the
pitcher
may
go
to
the
well
once
too
often
so
can
mendoza
success
has
made
him
bold
we
must
clips
his
wings
boys
at
that
sort
of
talk
a
cheer
burst
forth
from
the
circle
riders
they
already
knew
their
part
in
the
drive
and
while
about
half
of
them
galloped
after
the
foreman
the
others
followed
ted
conway
in
an
opposite
direction
chapter
v
at
the
quicksands
like
coming
from
the
east
which
means
that
herd
is
safe
remarked
bob
as
he
and
his
chum
stood
in
the
faint
light
of
early
morning
listening
eagerly
to
the
sounds
of
cattle
clicking
of
striking
the
peculiar
snap
of
hoofs
and
every
now
and
then
a
low
bellow
from
some
steer
that
had
been
prodded
to
keep
him
in
line
with
the
course
leading
to
the
big
corral
again
exclaimed
frank
with
evident
satisfaction
in
his
voice
you
think
you
caught
sounds
too
from
over
in
the
other
direction
asked
bob
seeing
his
chum
appeared
to
have
his
attention
turned
that
way
sure
of
it
came
the
reply
would
mean
both
herds
are
safe
then
frank
to
say
it
looks
that
way
replied
the
other
whose
keen
hearing
could
often
catch
sounds
that
were
unheard
by
the
less
keen
ears
of
bob
presently
there
could
be
no
doubt
about
it
from
two
directions
came
great
herds
of
prime
cattle
steers
cows
and
calves
partly
grown
and
many
ready
to
be
branded
at
the
fall
so
near
at
hand
for
a
time
there
was
more
or
less
excitement
as
the
herds
were
driven
through
the
gateway
into
the
great
corral
where
they
could
find
abundant
pasturage
for
a
day
or
two
while
the
main
body
of
cowboys
were
away
several
men
must
be
left
behind
to
attend
to
the
cattle
and
these
could
during
the
day
drive
the
big
herd
forth
to
the
nearest
grass
and
water
after
breakfast
ponies
were
looked
after
and
a
thousand
and
one
preparations
made
that
had
an
ominous
significance
had
the
rustler
pedro
mendoza
only
been
able
to
look
in
on
circle
ranch
just
then
it
must
have
flattered
his
pride
to
know
what
an
upheaval
his
raid
had
created
and
possibly
it
may
have
also
rendered
him
a
bit
uneasy
because
of
the
warlike
signs
which
those
determined
cowboys
manifested
as
they
prepared
to
take
to
the
trail
colonel
haywood
would
not
hurry
however
got
the
whole
day
before
us
boys
he
said
when
some
of
the
more
impatient
urged
that
they
get
away
faster
others
to
follow
if
need
be
they
drive
a
big
herd
away
faster
than
we
can
follow
if
only
we
keep
to
the
trail
we
must
watch
out
all
the
while
for
trickery
mendoza
has
won
out
that
way
every
time
he
ran
off
a
bunch
of
cattle
deceiving
those
who
tried
to
follow
and
this
time
we
mean
to
follow
him
to
his
secret
cache
remember
that
boys
the
talk
shouted
several
their
confidence
in
the
wisdom
of
their
employer
returning
in
due
time
then
a
determined
body
of
cowboys
galloped
away
from
the
ranch
buildings
heading
for
the
range
where
andy
and
clem
had
been
watching
their
herd
at
the
time
of
the
night
raid
besides
the
colonel
and
the
two
saddle
boys
there
were
ten
well
armed
men
in
the
group
of
riders
that
clattered
away
with
the
customary
vim
of
their
class
waving
their
hats
to
those
who
could
not
take
part
in
the
ride
and
apparently
filled
with
the
utmost
enthusiasm
bart
heminway
was
there
for
his
advice
would
prove
valuable
under
certain
conditions
because
the
foreman
was
a
veteran
in
the
cattle
line
besides
he
had
long
been
known
as
something
of
a
fighter
and
in
case
they
came
to
a
pitched
battle
with
the
rustlers
his
experience
would
be
worth
considerable
bob
was
naturally
deeply
interested
in
everything
he
saw
and
heard
while
he
had
now
been
in
the
southwest
more
than
a
year
this
was
his
first
experience
in
a
dangerous
foray
against
those
pests
of
the
stockmen
the
cattle
rustlers
and
bob
had
heard
so
much
about
mendoza
and
his
night
riders
that
boylike
he
was
anxious
to
actually
see
the
clever
mexican
at
close
quarters
do
you
think
your
father
will
do
frank
if
we
manage
to
find
where
mendoza
hangs
out
he
asked
his
chum
as
they
galloped
along
domino
and
buckskin
having
little
trouble
in
keeping
up
with
the
balance
of
the
horses
depends
a
good
deal
on
what
mendoza
does
himself
replied
frank
wise
enough
to
vamoose
at
sight
of
us
perhaps
we
get
a
crack
at
any
of
the
bunch
but
if
he
tries
to
stand
by
the
herd
and
fight
for
it
i
reckon
be
some
warm
doings
hope
we
can
follow
the
trail
and
for
the
life
of
me
i
see
how
they
could
hide
the
marks
of
fifty
head
of
cattle
it
must
take
pretty
fine
work
frank
to
do
that
you
think
up
to
all
that
sort
of
thing
frank
replied
heard
some
of
our
boys
say
an
indian
would
be
clumsy
at
hiding
tracks
alongside
a
few
of
best
hands
but
wait
and
see
what
happens
bob
perhaps
got
a
few
fellows
along
just
as
smart
at
finding
a
trail
as
they
are
at
hiding
hope
so
bob
rejoined
just
hate
to
have
to
go
home
like
a
whipped
dog
that
carries
his
tail
between
his
legs
and
frank
you
remember
what
your
father
said
about
thunder
mountain
and
how
we
saw
a
string
of
horses
being
led
into
the
canyon
that
night
replied
frank
quickly
and
significantly
part
of
the
game
bound
to
scratch
thunder
mountain
all
over
with
a
comb
before
we
give
up
beat
if
mendoza
does
have
a
hidden
cache
in
some
little
valley
where
he
keeps
his
stolen
herds
and
changes
the
brands
before
driving
them
to
market
we
expect
to
find
it
and
get
back
our
must
be
getting
near
the
place
where
andy
wrangled
his
herd
last
night
bob
went
on
ahead
there
replied
frank
are
you
feeling
just
now
bob
and
dandy
and
just
wild
to
know
how
going
to
come
out
bob
answered
is
i
have
a
single
care
or
worry
on
my
mind
right
now
if
it
for
that
knife
rats
will
you
never
forget
that
bob
i
was
in
hopes
dream
where
it
was
laughed
frank
i
and
a
fact
the
other
went
on
with
a
quick
look
at
his
face
i
suppose
you
did
either
frank
should
say
not
bob
i
give
you
my
word
never
set
eyes
on
that
blade
since
i
saw
you
use
it
the
day
before
where
was
that
frank
perhaps
you
might
give
me
a
little
clue
and
no
telling
what
it
might
lead
to
demanded
the
kentucky
boy
eagerly
you
remember
about
it
asked
frank
i
just
seem
to
get
a
line
on
it
bob
answered
gloomily
to
just
come
to
me
and
then
it
slips
away
i
used
the
knife
you
say
was
it
when
we
were
eating
lunch
on
that
little
hunt
we
took
frank
have
you
forgotten
that
you
started
in
to
show
me
how
much
you
knew
about
cutting
up
a
deer
the
right
way
frank
asked
still
laughing
at
his
chum
i
declare
a
fact
frank
of
course
i
had
to
use
my
knife
when
i
carved
that
antelope
you
up
with
your
red
handkerchief
and
knocked
over
before
he
was
able
to
satisfy
his
curiosity
but
frank
nearly
sure
i
can
remember
having
the
knife
we
were
eating
for
you
did
bob
but
honest
the
last
time
i
can
remember
seeing
you
use
it
here
we
are
at
the
place
now
and
watch
how
our
trailers
get
two
of
the
cow
punchers
who
were
known
to
be
superior
hands
at
following
an
obscure
trail
were
thrown
out
ahead
the
rest
kept
just
a
little
to
the
rear
since
they
did
not
wish
to
interfere
even
one
who
was
known
as
a
greenhorn
could
have
followed
the
broad
trail
of
fifty
head
of
cattle
leaving
that
spot
these
men
were
doing
more
as
they
rode
back
and
forth
their
keen
eyes
on
the
constant
watch
for
signs
they
began
to
pick
up
facts
that
would
presently
tell
them
just
how
many
of
the
rustlers
there
had
been
in
the
party
all
told
one
of
the
men
reported
presently
the
pony
with
the
cloven
hoof
is
one
spanish
joe
used
to
ride
when
he
was
on
our
bob
listened
to
this
with
growing
wonder
he
could
not
for
the
life
of
him
see
how
the
actual
number
of
the
thieves
could
be
discovered
so
early
in
the
pursuit
sure
to
learn
a
heap
before
we
get
back
to
the
ranch
again
he
mentioned
to
his
chum
just
reckon
you
will
frank
replied
with
a
grim
smile
for
he
knew
better
than
the
boy
from
kentucky
what
difficulties
would
have
to
be
surmounted
and
what
dangers
encountered
ere
they
could
wrest
that
stolen
herd
from
the
lawless
men
in
whose
possession
it
now
remained
an
riding
and
the
party
brought
up
beyond
the
purple
sage
mesa
where
on
that
former
occasion
the
dozen
cattle
that
had
vanished
in
company
with
old
baldy
had
been
traced
to
have
the
trail
end
near
the
dreaded
quicksands
that
had
swallowed
occasional
stray
mavericks
for
years
some
of
the
cowboys
looked
serious
as
though
they
feared
that
a
wholesale
sacrifice
had
been
made
to
the
deceptive
sands
which
never
gave
up
anything
upon
which
they
had
fastened
their
terrible
grip
you
believe
anything
of
the
sort
for
a
minute
boys
declared
the
stockman
positively
as
they
sat
in
the
saddles
looking
at
the
deceptive
hole
which
seemed
to
invite
them
on
as
offering
a
across
the
nearby
mountain
passes
head
of
fine
cattle
drop
in
there
last
night
and
driven
by
expert
cow
punchers
at
that
get
busy
now
and
find
out
just
where
the
trail
turned
to
the
right
or
left
no
matter
how
it
was
covered
up
later
where
we
turn
over
a
page
and
expose
senor
fine
hand
on
the
jump
everybody
now
chapter
vi
the
hidden
trail
of
mendoza
there
was
an
immediate
scattering
of
the
ten
cowboys
every
one
was
eager
to
be
first
to
make
a
discovery
jumping
to
the
ground
they
searched
the
earth
for
traces
that
would
indicate
how
the
herd
had
not
passed
into
the
quivering
quicksands
but
turned
aside
no
matter
how
cleverly
the
rustlers
had
concealed
the
marks
of
the
many
hoofs
and
left
a
few
tracks
to
deceive
some
of
those
keen
eyes
now
on
the
search
were
bound
to
discover
what
they
so
eagerly
sought
a
quick
call
from
one
quarter
soon
announced
that
the
expected
signs
had
been
found
riding
that
way
frank
and
bob
saw
that
the
trailer
scotty
was
indicating
his
discovery
to
bart
heminway
and
the
stockman
they
agreed
with
him
that
it
pointed
to
the
fact
of
the
herd
having
been
driven
that
way
a
little
further
on
and
they
saw
fresh
signs
that
had
escaped
the
scrutiny
of
the
rustlers
when
they
were
busy
concealing
all
marks
as
they
believed
to
indicate
the
passage
of
the
lost
herd
so
it
continued
until
finally
they
reached
rocky
ground
where
there
would
be
less
to
conceal
see
how
they
do
it
declared
bob
as
he
watched
the
two
men
in
the
lead
running
back
and
forth
like
a
couple
of
dogs
their
ponies
having
been
taken
in
charge
by
some
of
their
comrades
chuckled
frank
happen
to
know
that
one
of
them
scotty
there
would
be
just
as
surprised
to
hear
you
read
any
book
you
happened
to
pick
up
because
you
see
scotty
know
how
to
read
the
ground
is
like
a
printed
page
to
him
he
sees
scores
of
little
signs
you
would
never
notice
and
they
tell
him
things
just
as
the
letters
placed
in
combinations
tell
you
a
certain
word
is
frank
look
over
yonder
said
bob
pointing
ahead
i
see
it
all
right
replied
the
other
with
a
nod
and
a
laugh
old
friend
thunder
mountain
it
demanded
bob
right
replied
the
other
same
place
where
we
had
our
little
bunch
of
adventures
with
a
grizzly
a
cloudburst
and
a
few
other
things
not
to
forget
a
certain
fellow
named
peg
grant
who
tried
to
play
the
game
ahead
of
us
but
fell
frank
you
notice
i
reckon
that
we
seem
to
be
heading
right
in
the
direction
of
that
big
arroyo
that
leads
up
the
side
of
the
mountain
bob
went
on
surprise
me
one
little
bit
bob
his
chum
remarked
remember
we
figured
all
that
out
fact
is
things
begin
to
look
mighty
good
to
me
and
i
reckon
closer
to
finding
that
secret
corral
of
pedro
mendoza
right
at
this
very
minute
than
anybody
has
ever
been
noon
now
and
your
father
holding
up
his
hand
bob
remarked
means
he
wants
a
halt
called
while
we
take
a
cold
snack
and
talk
matters
over
frank
observed
know
my
dad
is
noted
for
being
cool
and
going
slow
about
things
seen
lots
of
others
lose
their
heads
but
he
was
nearer
to
being
excited
last
night
than
i
ever
saw
him
chances
are
we
may
lie
low
here
half
the
afternoon
because
rather
climb
that
canyon
after
prophecy
proved
a
true
one
for
as
they
ate
and
talked
the
stockman
proceeded
to
explain
his
plan
which
was
really
to
remain
quiet
where
they
were
under
the
shade
of
a
clump
of
willows
until
the
afternoon
was
well
spent
then
the
ride
could
be
resumed
though
no
one
doubted
now
where
it
would
lead
them
with
that
canyon
mouth
so
near
at
hand
several
hours
passed
they
were
almost
endless
to
impatient
bob
who
suffered
very
much
because
of
his
nervousness
and
a
desire
to
be
moving
but
finally
colonel
haywood
seemed
to
be
satisfied
that
the
object
of
the
delay
had
been
accomplished
whatever
that
might
be
and
he
gave
the
word
for
which
the
cow
punchers
had
been
so
eagerly
waiting
again
they
were
on
the
move
just
as
frank
had
said
the
trail
led
them
into
the
great
arroyo
that
looked
like
a
cleft
in
the
mountain
from
a
little
distance
sometimes
this
pass
was
used
by
stockmen
on
one
side
of
the
range
as
a
means
of
getting
a
herd
over
to
the
other
side
hence
it
was
not
strange
to
find
plain
traces
of
cattle
having
been
driven
along
here
and
the
rustlers
depended
on
this
very
knowledge
to
allow
of
a
slackening
of
their
labors
in
trying
to
wipe
out
all
marks
once
in
the
gap
and
the
sun
was
no
longer
to
be
seen
indeed
it
looked
dim
between
those
high
walls
and
one
could
almost
believe
evening
must
be
near
at
hand
to
think
frank
said
bob
when
we
were
here
before
we
thought
these
cliffs
were
the
real
thing
we
know
better
now
we
been
in
the
grand
canyon
of
the
colorado
and
frank
you
could
put
that
wall
yonder
against
one
of
the
colored
ones
up
there
and
it
would
look
like
an
ant
hill
am
i
right
reckon
you
are
bob
replied
the
other
that
anything
to
do
with
our
finding
the
lost
cattle
think
of
that
now
watch
scotty
up
ahead
there
going
some
i
tell
you
a
hound
follow
tracks
much
a
wonder
what
declared
bob
i
suppose
picking
up
heaps
of
information
right
along
eh
frank
asked
with
an
amused
smile
be
sure
i
am
but
there
seems
to
be
no
end
to
the
game
replied
bob
just
loaded
up
to
my
neck
with
questions
i
want
to
ask
scotty
when
i
get
a
chance
he
must
tell
me
why
he
did
this
thing
and
this
is
only
the
beginning
find
observed
frank
are
a
lot
more
coming
along
soon
that
you
want
to
miss
they
kept
along
for
another
half
hour
continually
ascending
the
rocky
pass
to
bob
there
was
an
added
interest
in
their
surroundings
because
of
the
adventures
that
had
come
to
frank
and
himself
during
their
earlier
visit
to
thunder
mountain
as
recorded
in
the
first
volume
of
this
series
frank
he
exclaimed
calling
the
attention
of
his
companion
to
a
certain
place
high
up
on
one
of
the
walls
that
where
we
had
to
climb
to
get
away
from
the
flood
that
rushed
through
this
pass
when
the
cloudburst
came
replied
the
other
can
see
the
very
ledge
we
stood
on
wondering
if
we
would
be
carried
away
or
not
that
was
a
narrow
squeak
bob
for
believe
you
frank
but
we
pulled
through
all
right
more
than
once
since
then
when
things
have
looked
ticklish
i
think
of
that
time
and
make
up
my
mind
the
sky
so
dark
as
it
looks
but
it
sure
is
getting
near
night
down
in
this
hole
you
watching
scotty
bob
demanded
frank
saw
him
turn
aside
just
then
replied
the
other
like
he
was
interested
a
little
in
that
narrow
crack
in
the
wall
but
i
see
passed
on
and
is
waving
to
the
bunch
to
come
after
him
so
i
reckon
there
anything
doing
be
too
sure
of
that
said
frank
what
do
you
mean
demanded
his
chum
eagerly
i
saw
scotty
give
my
dad
a
quick
sign
that
stood
for
something
frank
went
on
to
say
that
little
hole
in
the
wall
you
mean
asked
bob
was
while
he
was
down
on
his
hands
and
knees
there
that
he
made
it
so
got
a
hunch
it
was
about
that
same
hole
but
seem
to
pay
any
particular
attention
as
we
ride
you
think
there
might
be
somebody
watching
us
is
that
it
asked
bob
not
if
these
rustlers
are
half
as
smart
as
they
say
you
think
they
would
be
apt
to
have
a
vidette
posted
on
the
side
of
the
mountain
and
frank
declined
to
turn
his
head
in
the
slightest
as
they
rode
past
the
cleft
that
hardly
seemed
wide
enough
for
a
fat
steer
to
pass
into
they
rode
slowly
along
up
the
canyon
picking
their
way
carefully
around
such
obstructions
as
came
in
the
path
you
been
looking
to
see
if
there
are
as
many
signs
up
here
as
below
bob
asked
of
his
chum
as
he
noticed
frank
watching
the
ground
by
bending
over
in
his
saddle
seem
to
get
on
to
them
if
they
are
replied
the
other
then
better
hold
in
our
horses
a
little
and
hear
what
scotty
has
to
say
pretty
soon
call
a
halt
and
then
but
they
continued
on
until
it
became
so
dark
in
the
canyon
that
the
ponies
frequently
stumbled
scotty
had
fallen
back
and
was
riding
alongside
the
stockman
now
with
whom
he
seemed
to
be
conversing
eagerly
as
though
he
had
news
worth
while
to
communicate
then
colonel
haywood
threw
up
his
hand
it
was
a
signal
to
halt
recognized
by
every
one
in
the
party
pressing
in
a
little
circle
around
the
leaders
they
waited
to
hear
how
things
were
working
leave
the
ponies
up
here
boys
said
the
stockman
go
back
on
foot
do
you
remember
noticing
that
little
split
in
the
left
side
of
the
arroyo
where
scotty
halted
a
few
seconds
well
the
herd
was
driven
through
that
one
at
a
time
the
secret
passage
no
one
has
ever
been
able
to
find
up
to
all
sorts
of
low
exclamations
told
how
eagerly
the
cow
punchers
received
the
welcome
news
that
the
long
hidden
trail
had
been
found
do
you
suppose
scotty
ever
made
that
out
asked
bob
unable
to
hold
his
curiosity
in
check
do
you
reckon
he
found
the
tracks
of
the
cattle
on
the
stones
where
the
rustlers
failed
to
make
out
there
might
be
lots
of
ways
of
knowing
that
replied
the
other
boy
to
tell
you
the
truth
bob
i
saw
scotty
taking
a
quick
look
at
the
sharp
edges
of
the
rock
just
where
the
crack
starts
now
it
surprise
me
much
if
he
discovered
some
bunches
of
hair
fastened
there
where
it
was
rubbed
off
the
flank
of
a
steer
that
quite
take
the
middle
of
the
road
while
passing
never
thought
of
that
bob
said
in
a
low
tone
another
page
made
clear
oh
but
all
this
is
mighty
interesting
to
me
i
tell
you
frank
i
only
wish
i
could
write
shorthand
and
have
it
all
down
in
black
and
better
have
it
written
in
your
memory
where
it
can
never
be
rubbed
out
remarked
frank
dismounting
as
all
the
others
were
doing
chapter
vii
the
secret
valley
the
programme
frank
asked
the
kentucky
boy
a
short
time
later
after
they
had
taken
the
horses
into
a
little
bay
which
the
colonel
called
a
where
they
could
be
easily
kept
by
piling
up
some
of
the
big
rocks
at
the
mouth
though
one
cowboy
must
be
left
to
guard
them
i
understand
it
replied
frank
first
a
bite
to
eat
and
then
down
the
canyon
for
ours
when
we
come
to
that
hole
in
the
wall
slip
through
and
find
out
where
we
bring
frank
do
you
really
believe
all
that
herd
passed
through
that
little
opening
why
fill
any
sort
of
cave
and
besides
how
under
the
sun
would
they
get
anything
to
eat
remember
that
only
guessing
returned
his
chum
the
way
i
figure
it
out
that
cleft
in
the
wall
runs
back
some
little
way
and
perhaps
keeps
getting
bigger
all
the
while
presently
it
turns
into
a
regular
trail
over
the
rocks
that
the
cattle
will
follow
single
file
and
mark
me
bob
sooner
or
later
turn
up
in
a
valley
among
the
mountains
here
that
no
cowboy
has
ever
set
eyes
is
unless
in
with
like
a
fairy
story
frank
objected
bob
who
was
very
practical
of
things
do
until
you
really
pass
through
the
experience
and
then
you
know
they
are
the
real
article
i
feel
that
my
dad
believes
the
same
way
i
do
and
bart
heminway
too
but
know
after
a
while
bob
if
we
just
hold
our
horses
there
get
busy
with
some
of
that
grub
carrying
we
have
to
depend
on
getting
game
this
time
in
order
to
make
sure
of
a
the
moon
was
up
when
they
prepared
to
quit
the
spot
one
rider
was
left
behind
to
guard
the
saddle
band
down
the
canyon
then
they
went
like
a
bunch
of
shadows
flitting
silently
along
all
talking
above
whispers
was
positively
forbidden
reaching
the
spot
where
that
mysterious
opening
occurred
in
the
wall
of
the
canyon
scotty
slipped
inside
without
a
delay
the
others
following
after
one
at
a
time
bob
kept
close
behind
his
chum
he
had
several
good
reasons
for
that
in
the
first
place
frank
was
and
would
serve
as
a
guide
to
his
less
experienced
comrade
then
again
if
there
arose
any
occasion
for
communications
bob
wanted
to
be
where
he
could
whisper
in
his
ear
just
as
frank
had
said
he
believed
would
prove
to
be
the
case
that
cleft
in
the
rocks
did
turn
out
to
be
a
narrow
passage
it
wound
in
and
out
for
some
distance
once
bob
saw
the
man
in
the
lead
strike
a
match
and
look
at
the
rocks
at
his
feet
scotty
appeared
quite
satisfied
with
the
result
of
his
examination
and
bob
saw
him
showing
something
that
he
had
picked
up
to
the
stockman
then
the
match
went
out
and
the
march
was
resumed
up
bob
whispered
frank
presently
i
can
see
the
stars
answered
the
other
also
keeping
his
voice
down
you
can
which
shows
that
come
out
from
the
passage
and
once
more
stand
in
the
open
passed
through
one
of
the
walls
of
the
mountains
this
is
some
narrow
valley
back
of
the
outer
part
and
sure
going
to
lead
us
to
the
hidden
corral
where
mendoza
keeps
all
his
stolen
stock
as
they
kept
on
bob
was
fortified
to
undergo
any
amount
of
fatigue
the
thought
of
being
connected
with
the
expedition
that
might
unearth
the
long
cherished
secret
of
the
rustlers
was
enough
to
give
anyone
additional
courage
and
endurance
still
when
an
hour
had
passed
and
they
were
still
on
the
move
he
admitted
that
he
was
getting
a
little
tired
now
and
then
they
could
get
glimpses
of
the
moon
though
as
a
rule
their
passage
was
continued
through
dense
shadows
where
the
overhanging
rocks
shut
out
the
light
or
the
same
result
was
obtained
through
the
trees
under
which
the
trail
led
looking
up
from
time
to
time
bob
could
see
the
outline
of
a
ridge
on
either
side
he
could
not
remember
ever
having
looked
upon
such
a
peculiar
formation
during
his
previous
visit
to
thunder
mountain
then
surmise
must
have
hit
near
the
truth
and
they
were
now
moving
along
a
narrow
little
valley
that
was
artfully
concealed
behind
the
crest
of
the
mountain
about
it
getting
tired
questioned
frank
when
an
opportunity
arose
that
brought
their
heads
close
together
nothing
to
speak
of
replied
the
other
for
bob
was
proud
and
would
never
willingly
admit
that
he
lacked
in
nerve
or
ability
to
equal
others
in
anything
undertaken
got
a
hunch
that
we
must
be
near
the
place
frank
went
on
with
the
idea
of
bolstering
up
the
waning
powers
of
his
chum
sounds
as
if
you
believe
this
might
be
the
valley
where
they
keep
their
stock
remarked
bob
wondering
a
little
more
do
i
believe
that
it
is
frank
replied
lonely
enough
all
right
but
little
save
bare
rock
here
and
cattle
have
to
graze
you
understand
bob
hold
out
a
little
longer
and
i
reckon
going
to
run
up
against
another
quick
turn
perhaps
be
in
the
shape
of
a
second
passage
under
this
ridge
here
on
the
left
that
will
show
us
into
this
the
words
somehow
thrilled
bob
he
realized
that
this
was
indeed
a
serious
business
upon
which
in
company
with
the
circle
ranch
cow
punchers
he
was
now
fully
embarked
what
the
end
would
be
it
was
impossible
to
more
than
conjecture
scotty
was
constantly
on
the
watch
as
though
he
too
anticipated
a
change
in
the
conditions
sooner
or
later
and
did
not
mean
to
pass
the
turn
by
whenever
the
moon
served
he
would
try
to
examine
the
ground
most
carefully
evidently
looking
for
signs
that
would
tell
of
cattle
having
passed
this
way
many
times
once
when
they
had
not
been
able
to
take
advantage
of
the
light
for
almost
ten
minutes
scotty
grew
restless
going
to
strike
another
match
remarked
frank
in
his
ear
as
he
saw
the
trailer
getting
down
on
hands
and
knees
close
to
the
rocks
his
prediction
proved
to
be
true
for
immediately
afterward
bob
saw
a
small
glow
with
the
face
of
scotty
pressed
close
to
the
ground
as
he
moved
back
and
forth
eagerly
looking
for
something
that
seemed
to
be
missing
seem
able
to
find
it
frank
said
bob
guessing
the
truth
from
these
signs
what
echoed
his
chum
who
had
arrived
at
that
conclusion
half
a
minute
before
it
struck
bob
would
that
mean
then
continued
the
kentucky
boy
that
we
must
have
passed
by
the
place
where
the
trail
turned
aside
frank
answered
quickly
have
to
go
back
again
and
find
it
is
that
so
frank
what
do
answered
the
other
adding
scotty
is
talking
it
over
with
dad
and
bart
telling
them
no
stock
have
ever
come
up
as
high
in
the
valley
as
this
and
that
we
must
go
back
to
find
where
they
broke
out
but
bound
to
find
it
you
know
they
did
and
without
any
great
trouble
scotty
knowing
that
the
secret
passage
must
be
just
a
little
below
was
on
the
watch
every
foot
of
the
way
and
in
the
end
he
discovered
another
crevice
in
the
side
of
the
mountain
through
which
undoubtedly
the
stock
had
been
driven
but
there
must
have
been
considerable
excitement
around
here
when
all
those
steers
cows
and
calves
were
hustled
along
this
trail
frank
whispered
as
in
imagination
he
could
see
mexican
rustlers
heading
the
drove
off
and
compelling
the
frightened
animals
to
enter
the
second
opening
take
off
my
hat
to
such
drivers
of
cattle
as
those
fellows
remarked
bob
who
did
not
understand
how
the
thing
could
have
been
done
this
time
they
were
only
a
short
while
in
the
narrow
cut
all
they
had
to
do
was
to
follow
straight
ahead
and
keep
in
single
file
every
man
was
also
warned
not
to
try
to
make
haste
for
they
did
not
wish
to
betray
their
presence
by
any
unlucky
stumble
scotty
in
the
van
was
on
the
lookout
for
signs
of
a
trap
he
knew
that
mendoza
had
long
ago
earned
the
name
of
the
because
of
his
cunning
not
only
in
hoodwinking
those
who
tried
to
camp
on
his
trail
but
on
account
of
his
skill
in
laying
snares
for
the
feet
of
pursuers
more
than
one
party
had
come
to
grief
in
times
past
just
when
they
expected
they
had
the
rustler
chief
in
a
hole
bob
became
suddenly
aware
of
the
fact
that
the
creeping
line
had
stopped
on
his
arm
he
felt
the
hand
of
frank
haywood
and
this
pressure
was
the
signal
understood
among
them
up
ahead
was
whispered
in
ear
and
as
he
turned
his
eyes
obediently
upward
he
discovered
what
he
took
to
be
a
giant
firefly
glowing
in
the
darkness
of
the
would
vanish
only
to
again
appear
like
a
small
star
chapter
viii
way
is
clear
is
it
frank
whispered
bob
as
he
stared
in
wonder
at
the
strange
firefly
that
seemed
to
appear
and
then
vanish
so
regularly
sentry
smoking
a
cigarette
came
the
reply
silly
of
me
not
to
have
guessed
that
thought
the
kentucky
boy
and
then
he
sniffed
the
air
for
it
chanced
that
the
night
wind
was
blowing
gently
from
the
point
where
that
fire
glowed
sure
enough
and
from
a
cigarette
just
as
frank
said
he
continued
to
himself
of
course
it
was
very
plain
now
why
the
expedition
had
come
to
such
a
sudden
halt
here
was
a
vidette
posted
in
a
position
where
he
could
discover
any
suspicious
movement
below
there
was
a
wide
strip
of
moonlight
confronting
them
and
it
would
be
difficult
to
pass
along
the
trail
without
crossing
this
when
of
course
the
keen
eyes
above
would
discover
their
presence
are
we
going
to
do
about
it
frank
he
managed
to
say
in
his
ear
is
the
main
lot
of
us
replied
frank
how
about
scotty
bob
continued
determined
to
be
posted
that
to
him
figuring
on
doing
something
right
now
frank
replied
and
indeed
the
kentucky
boy
could
see
that
the
guide
of
the
expedition
was
leaving
the
main
body
as
though
he
had
arranged
his
programme
bob
could
give
a
pretty
shrewd
guess
as
to
what
was
necessary
that
sentry
must
not
be
allowed
to
block
the
way
much
longer
so
long
as
he
sat
there
in
the
shadows
above
the
cowboys
could
not
advance
a
step
without
taking
risks
and
if
discovered
this
early
in
the
night
they
knew
that
their
plans
would
receive
a
serious
setback
evidently
scotty
was
about
to
make
some
sort
of
move
looking
to
the
capture
of
the
vidette
bob
had
heard
colonel
haywood
warn
his
men
that
there
was
to
be
no
blood
shed
unless
the
rustlers
put
up
a
desperate
resistance
the
stockman
was
known
as
a
humane
man
and
believed
in
peaceful
tactics
whenever
possible
although
if
forced
to
the
wall
he
could
fight
hard
a
second
cow
puncher
started
to
creep
immediately
after
scotty
that
looked
as
if
they
wanted
to
make
sure
of
the
game
low
was
the
whispered
word
passed
along
the
line
and
hence
the
two
saddle
boys
remained
where
they
chanced
to
be
crouching
beyond
the
narrow
pass
no
doubt
lay
a
fertile
valley
which
the
cunning
mendoza
had
long
utilized
as
a
corral
here
he
kept
his
stolen
herds
while
the
brands
were
being
changed
when
the
hue
and
cry
had
died
down
no
doubt
he
would
drive
the
cattle
forth
taking
care
to
avoid
the
neighborhood
where
his
latest
operations
had
been
carried
on
hard
and
perhaps
hear
something
familiar
bob
heard
his
comrade
whisper
from
this
he
fancied
that
what
frank
meant
would
not
have
any
connection
with
the
presence
of
that
rustler
perched
high
on
the
hillside
so
he
concentrated
his
mind
on
discovering
something
else
a
minute
later
and
he
drew
head
close
to
his
own
lips
to
say
thing
i
can
catch
the
sound
of
cattle
moving
about
and
there
was
a
lowing
sound
as
plain
as
i
ever
heard
a
cow
make
not
half
a
mile
away
frank
is
that
so
what
they
are
our
lost
herd
and
perhaps
other
stray
steers
along
with
came
the
answer
bob
was
strangely
thrilled
by
the
situation
he
seemed
to
feel
that
they
were
on
the
verge
of
great
doings
just
beyond
lay
the
enchanted
valley
of
which
cowboys
had
often
hinted
but
of
which
no
one
seemed
to
know
the
exact
location
and
soon
when
scotty
and
his
comrade
had
cleared
the
way
they
were
going
to
enter
that
secret
cache
of
the
mexican
rustler
to
claim
their
own
again
for
years
had
this
bold
mendoza
been
having
things
pretty
much
his
own
way
in
the
cow
country
he
had
many
secret
allies
on
the
ranches
who
sent
him
word
of
rich
prizes
to
be
captured
as
well
as
plans
on
foot
looking
to
his
taking
and
by
pulling
these
strings
whenever
he
felt
like
it
he
had
been
enabled
to
laugh
at
all
efforts
undertaken
by
the
stockmen
to
down
him
yes
even
bob
the
late
tenderfoot
could
now
understand
that
there
must
be
a
good
sized
herd
of
cattle
somewhere
nearby
various
sounds
declared
it
besides
when
the
night
breeze
happened
to
increase
in
strength
for
a
few
seconds
at
a
time
he
believed
he
could
hear
the
tinkling
of
a
mandolin
and
a
voice
singing
some
spanish
serenade
evidently
then
the
rustlers
were
so
accustomed
to
feeling
perfectly
secure
in
this
lonely
valley
far
away
from
everything
civilized
that
they
took
life
easily
and
acted
as
though
quite
at
home
but
scotty
and
his
mate
had
been
gone
some
time
now
bob
remembered
ought
to
be
getting
pretty
close
up
they
frank
he
questioned
in
the
low
tone
that
had
characterized
their
brief
conversation
hitherto
the
fire
was
all
the
answer
he
received
but
it
was
enough
bob
knew
his
chum
was
anticipating
seeing
a
change
take
place
at
any
minute
now
that
he
fully
believed
the
two
agile
cow
punchers
must
have
had
ample
time
to
crawl
up
the
incline
he
found
himself
wondering
whether
the
sentry
would
make
any
outcry
of
course
any
such
sound
would
threaten
the
success
of
their
plans
since
it
must
excite
the
curiosity
of
the
rustlers
and
lead
to
an
examination
but
then
scotty
knew
what
he
was
about
and
would
hold
his
hand
until
he
could
be
sure
of
silence
and
success
somehow
bob
found
himself
putting
the
utmost
faith
in
the
cowboy
the
remarkable
manner
in
which
scotty
had
led
them
thus
far
seemed
to
stamp
him
as
capable
the
glow
of
the
end
of
the
cigarette
could
still
be
seen
in
the
shadows
under
that
clump
of
trees
that
clung
to
the
face
of
the
mountain
of
course
the
man
who
smoked
had
consumed
more
than
one
little
weed
during
this
time
but
mexicans
have
a
way
of
rolling
them
deftly
between
their
fingers
when
smoking
and
lighting
one
from
the
end
of
another
in
succession
straining
his
eyes
bob
endeavored
to
make
out
some
moving
form
near
that
point
upon
which
the
attention
of
the
watchers
below
was
concentrated
in
this
he
did
not
succeed
those
who
were
creeping
upon
the
man
who
lolled
there
enjoying
his
smoke
and
perhaps
dreaming
of
some
day
when
he
could
return
to
his
native
country
with
his
pockets
filled
with
gold
were
moving
with
all
the
care
that
marks
the
advance
of
the
gray
panther
when
approaching
his
intended
prey
bob
was
becoming
uneasy
the
strain
began
to
tell
upon
him
wholly
unaccustomed
as
he
was
to
such
scenes
of
excitement
and
suspense
he
even
found
himself
imagining
all
sorts
of
unpleasant
accidents
as
happening
to
scotty
anyone
of
which
would
interfere
with
the
successful
carrying
out
of
his
plans
but
frank
seemed
to
have
no
such
fears
when
bob
started
to
mention
what
was
worrying
him
his
chum
immediately
eased
his
mind
you
believe
it
for
a
minute
bob
he
whispered
is
right
close
to
that
rustler
now
and
perhaps
before
you
could
wink
fifty
times
make
his
move
keep
on
watching
the
light
when
it
suddenly
goes
out
and
die
down
know
something
has
happened
so
bob
took
fresh
heart
and
continued
to
keep
his
eyes
glued
on
the
point
of
fire
which
he
knew
marked
the
spot
where
the
vidette
sat
then
suddenly
he
missed
the
spark
it
had
vanished
without
the
slightest
warning
bob
felt
his
chum
move
and
thought
frank
gave
a
little
gasp
as
of
satisfaction
yes
and
unless
his
own
ears
had
deceived
him
he
caught
some
sort
of
rustling
sound
up
yonder
where
the
vidette
had
his
post
evidently
scotty
had
acted
from
the
fact
that
there
was
no
outcry
bob
judged
that
the
movement
had
been
a
success
still
no
one
among
the
crouching
cowboys
moved
hand
or
foot
they
were
waiting
for
a
signal
of
some
sort
inviting
them
onward
and
upward
when
scotty
and
his
companion
felt
sure
that
they
had
the
sentry
so
bound
and
gagged
that
he
could
not
give
any
alarm
they
would
doubtless
let
their
allies
know
the
light
did
not
reappear
though
bob
strained
his
eyes
in
the
effort
to
discover
it
from
this
fact
he
knew
that
something
had
indeed
happened
he
got
him
do
you
think
frank
he
could
not
keep
from
asking
cautiously
any
doubt
about
it
came
the
confident
reply
heard
him
drop
and
he
would
have
whooped
it
up
only
fingers
closed
on
his
throat
and
cut
the
yell
off
just
give
a
minute
more
to
fix
him
up
right
then
get
the
glad
that
part
of
the
job
is
over
and
no
alarm
given
thought
bob
his
nerves
relaxing
somewhat
after
the
recent
strain
and
while
he
lay
there
waiting
ready
to
make
a
fresh
start
when
the
time
came
he
heard
what
he
thought
was
a
little
bird
uttering
a
lazy
twitter
somewhere
up
on
the
mountainside
frank
began
to
get
up
you
going
frank
asked
the
kentucky
lad
also
rising
to
his
knees
on
the
move
came
the
reply
you
hear
the
signal
bob
heard
what
i
thought
was
the
sound
of
a
sleepy
bird
disturbed
on
his
perch
was
that
what
you
meant
asked
bob
replied
frank
came
from
our
friend
scotty
it
told
us
the
way
is
clear
and
that
we
might
as
well
get
a
move
on
so
here
we
start
into
the
valley
where
our
prize
herd
is
kept
on
the
did
that
thing
up
handsome
frank
admitted
bob
a
way
scotty
has
chuckled
the
other
never
goes
into
anything
but
he
carries
it
out
like
machine
work
and
bob
this
is
only
the
beginning
remember
got
a
heap
cut
out
for
us
yet
going
to
be
a
night
never
forget
as
long
as
you
live
and
as
for
senor
mendoza
the
boys
of
circle
ranch
expect
to
give
him
his
waterloo
right
here
in
his
own
camp
come
along
bob
show
how
you
can
move
along
this
path
into
the
narrow
chapter
ix
the
cattle
cache
just
as
bob
had
anticipated
it
was
found
that
the
narrow
pass
served
somewhat
as
the
neck
of
the
bottle
perhaps
it
was
the
only
way
whereby
cattle
could
enter
or
leave
the
secret
valley
lying
between
the
several
spurs
of
the
high
ridge
by
blocking
this
pass
with
rocks
as
had
apparently
been
done
there
was
little
chance
of
any
wandering
on
the
part
of
the
trapped
herd
the
two
boys
had
to
clamber
over
these
rocks
bob
could
see
that
they
had
recently
been
moved
to
the
position
they
now
occupied
wonder
how
the
old
chap
ever
made
it
he
murmured
as
he
went
down
the
other
side
of
the
barrier
frank
chuckled
for
it
happened
that
just
then
his
thoughts
were
roving
in
exactly
the
same
quarter
that
the
words
spoken
by
his
chum
would
indicate
held
attention
thinking
of
old
baldy
eh
bob
he
asked
softly
what
i
was
replied
the
other
wondering
how
he
ever
got
over
all
those
rocks
when
he
escaped
frank
went
on
must
have
had
wings
to
do
it
what
shucks
frank
remarked
believe
for
a
second
the
old
rascal
ever
went
up
over
this
barricade
perhaps
it
happen
to
be
here
at
the
time
he
flew
the
coop
then
again
it
might
be
the
sharp
old
chap
found
some
other
way
of
leaving
the
hidden
valley
that
even
the
rustlers
know
nothing
wonder
frank
said
the
other
as
wise
as
they
make
i
more
at
present
bob
cautioned
frank
having
climbed
over
the
barrier
designed
to
block
the
neck
of
the
valley
which
had
so
long
served
mendoza
as
a
hiding
place
for
his
stolen
stock
the
two
lads
followed
colonel
haywood
and
the
cow
punchers
the
broad
stretch
of
moonlight
had
been
left
behind
and
now
they
were
passing
along
through
shadows
again
bob
hardly
knew
when
scotty
and
his
mate
joined
the
column
so
silently
did
they
appear
the
first
thing
he
realized
some
one
was
at
the
side
of
the
stockman
and
appeared
to
be
conferring
with
him
in
low
tones
as
they
moved
along
and
when
they
chanced
to
pass
through
a
patch
of
moonlight
he
saw
that
it
was
scotty
of
course
from
this
he
understood
that
the
sentry
had
been
placed
in
a
condition
where
he
could
do
no
harm
somewhere
aloft
there
he
was
undoubtedly
lying
tied
up
like
a
mummy
of
the
ancient
pyramids
and
doubtless
filled
with
wonder
as
to
what
had
happened
they
seemed
to
be
following
what
was
evidently
a
path
partly
made
by
the
hoofs
of
many
cattle
coming
and
going
now
it
seemed
to
run
along
over
the
plain
side
of
the
mountain
but
occasionally
it
hugged
the
edge
of
what
appeared
to
be
a
sheer
descent
no
doubt
in
the
light
of
day
this
would
have
not
been
a
dangerous
route
it
was
quite
a
different
thing
now
for
the
moon
failed
to
be
of
any
assistance
owing
to
the
lay
of
the
land
bob
was
making
his
way
along
with
more
or
less
confidence
never
dreaming
of
sudden
peril
for
he
had
faith
in
his
abilities
as
a
mountain
climber
but
it
proved
that
after
all
he
was
not
quite
so
as
those
who
had
been
brought
up
to
such
work
bob
always
claimed
that
it
was
a
pebble
under
his
foot
that
caused
him
to
slip
he
felt
a
thrill
of
alarm
as
he
felt
himself
going
for
a
black
gulf
lay
on
that
side
of
him
and
he
could
only
guess
how
far
he
would
tumble
if
he
went
over
he
naturally
made
a
convulsive
effort
to
clutch
some
object
that
would
prevent
his
slipping
beyond
the
edge
upon
which
he
was
now
perilously
balanced
and
queer
as
it
might
seem
when
he
looked
back
after
it
was
all
over
bob
realized
that
he
was
really
more
concerned
about
the
noise
his
fall
would
make
thus
betraying
the
presence
of
his
comrades
than
what
would
happen
to
him
personally
fortunately
frank
had
been
on
the
watch
he
knew
the
kentucky
boy
was
not
quite
so
sure
on
his
feet
as
the
rest
of
them
and
besides
bob
must
be
more
or
less
tired
just
then
so
when
he
heard
that
suspicious
grating
sound
which
told
of
a
stumble
frank
turned
instantly
his
hand
shot
out
and
by
the
best
of
luck
came
in
contact
with
the
extended
rifle
of
bob
there
was
a
quick
clutch
and
as
frank
had
braced
himself
for
the
little
shock
he
managed
to
hold
the
other
and
in
another
second
bob
was
once
more
back
on
the
path
trembling
not
a
little
but
safe
that
was
a
bad
job
for
me
frank
he
gasped
might
have
been
worse
came
from
his
chum
rather
dryly
mean
that
and
you
know
it
added
bob
the
noise
of
that
piece
of
rock
i
kicked
over
the
edge
what
if
it
was
heard
by
some
of
the
rustlers
much
danger
because
you
see
too
far
away
from
here
besides
frank
continued
a
thing
alarm
them
a
rock
may
roll
down
the
side
of
a
mountain
like
this
at
any
time
it
was
only
the
growling
that
came
from
the
heart
of
thunder
mountain
that
used
to
rattle
the
indians
and
frank
these
rustlers
used
to
mind
it
did
they
asked
bob
been
thinking
that
over
his
chum
replied
come
to
the
conclusion
that
mendoza
must
have
found
out
the
truth
for
himself
long
ago
and
knew
about
the
big
geyser
that
boiled
up
inside
the
he
and
his
men
kept
it
a
secret
all
right
bob
remarked
as
he
followed
close
on
the
heels
of
frank
the
dangerous
point
having
now
been
passed
by
paid
him
to
do
that
you
see
frank
went
on
long
as
indians
and
ignorant
prospectors
as
well
as
cowboys
believed
the
place
to
be
haunted
he
knew
they
would
fight
shy
of
thunder
mountain
and
his
valley
ranch
here
be
known
but
the
worm
has
turned
at
last
and
this
is
going
to
mark
the
end
of
the
secret
once
more
bob
held
his
peace
he
was
interested
in
watching
ahead
and
noting
what
seemed
to
be
lights
in
the
valley
i
miss
my
guess
fires
too
he
said
to
himself
when
that
one
flamed
up
just
then
i
sure
saw
what
looked
like
a
cabin
just
back
of
it
why
i
be
surprised
if
that
mendoza
has
got
a
regular
little
colony
planted
right
here
this
must
be
where
he
lives
when
he
out
rustling
cattle
and
running
off
with
the
saddle
bands
belonging
to
ranches
talk
about
nerve
would
you
of
course
as
they
advanced
along
the
side
of
the
valley
the
sounds
that
had
come
so
faintly
to
their
ears
when
beyond
the
barrier
now
grew
more
positive
cattle
could
be
heard
trust
the
experienced
ears
of
cowboys
for
detecting
their
presence
then
besides
voices
sounded
as
men
called
out
to
one
another
while
the
fellow
who
twanged
the
mandolin
persisted
in
his
efforts
to
practice
on
the
airs
he
possibly
meant
to
sing
the
next
time
he
went
courting
down
below
the
mexican
border
that
the
rustlers
had
been
in
this
place
a
long
time
unsuspected
by
any
of
the
stockmen
or
even
the
state
authorities
frank
soon
had
positive
evidence
this
mean
asked
bob
as
they
came
to
what
seemed
to
be
a
barbed
wire
fence
six
strands
high
a
corral
to
keep
the
cattle
in
at
times
perhaps
while
the
branding
is
going
on
answered
his
chum
familiar
with
all
such
devices
wager
then
that
old
baldy
broke
through
it
bob
declared
think
that
impossible
because
done
it
many
a
time
in
the
past
frank
whispered
in
his
turn
how
did
you
guess
it
i
noticed
frank
that
he
was
considerably
torn
along
one
of
his
shoulders
and
the
marks
looked
fresh
just
as
barbed
fencing
always
jabs
a
steer
went
on
the
other
for
you
bob
glad
you
had
your
eyes
about
you
that
time
frank
said
for
it
always
pleased
him
to
find
that
his
chum
was
observing
little
things
such
as
serve
as
straws
to
show
which
way
the
wind
blows
wonder
how
many
men
there
are
in
this
place
bob
continued
for
he
was
so
filled
with
a
desire
to
obtain
information
that
he
could
not
keep
from
asking
questions
telling
frank
replied
enough
to
give
us
a
tussle
in
case
we
have
to
get
down
to
hard
blows
which
i
hope
we
all
we
want
is
to
get
back
our
if
the
rustlers
try
to
keep
us
from
recovering
the
herd
what
then
frank
and
of
the
worst
kind
was
the
reply
between
dad
and
scotty
and
bart
i
reckon
be
able
to
manage
things
got
one
chap
with
his
wings
clipped
right
now
perhaps
there
may
be
others
sooner
or
mean
take
them
prisoner
asked
bob
would
be
what
my
dad
would
want
if
he
had
his
way
but
all
we
have
to
do
is
to
lie
low
and
obey
orders
ready
to
help
as
far
as
i
can
and
i
know
you
are
too
seem
to
be
creeping
closer
all
the
time
remarked
bob
and
for
that
reason
suppose
we
stop
talking
now
if
really
necessary
you
can
whisper
close
to
my
ear
but
better
keep
quiet
all
you
can
said
frank
and
his
chum
took
the
hint
they
could
now
easily
make
out
the
men
as
they
walked
back
and
forth
or
lounged
in
the
camp
the
several
cabins
and
tents
could
also
be
plainly
seen
as
the
fires
burned
cheerfully
or
the
moon
looked
down
on
the
scene
mounting
higher
above
the
rim
of
the
ridge
to
the
east
fringed
with
a
straggling
row
of
stunted
trees
bob
had
never
expected
to
be
given
a
chance
to
look
in
on
the
camp
of
a
rustler
band
and
especially
one
so
notorious
as
pedro
more
than
once
he
rubbed
his
eyes
as
though
suspecting
that
he
might
be
dreaming
but
the
voices
of
the
men
around
the
fires
the
clashing
of
cattle
near
by
and
the
picture
of
the
cabins
still
remained
to
prove
the
truth
and
show
him
that
it
was
real
chapter
x
a
surprise
when
half
an
hour
had
passed
both
boys
began
to
grow
a
little
anxious
they
knew
that
undoubtedly
those
in
charge
of
the
expedition
must
have
been
holding
a
council
of
war
and
deciding
on
the
course
to
be
carried
out
here
for
me
bob
frank
whispered
are
you
going
asked
the
other
suspiciously
for
he
wanted
to
be
in
any
move
as
well
as
did
his
chum
to
see
dad
and
find
out
doing
sure
be
back
again
right
away
frank
told
him
right
find
me
here
lying
like
a
log
grunted
bob
is
if
this
keeps
on
just
turn
into
one
getting
that
stiff
in
the
frank
crept
away
softly
and
the
kentucky
boy
continued
to
stretch
out
in
the
dense
shadows
listening
to
the
sounds
that
came
from
the
camp
not
very
far
away
a
soft
murmuring
sound
told
bob
that
he
was
near
some
spring
possibly
that
which
supplied
the
drinking
water
for
the
camp
and
in
running
down
the
side
of
the
valley
it
evidently
also
satisfied
the
thirst
of
the
cattle
in
the
corral
near
by
in
not
more
than
ten
minutes
though
perhaps
it
seemed
much
longer
than
that
to
bob
his
chum
crawled
alongside
again
queried
bob
indian
fashion
got
it
all
arranged
frank
answered
between
gasps
for
he
was
breathing
hard
after
his
recent
exertions
mean
about
capturing
the
herd
frank
mean
about
making
prisoners
of
the
rustlers
replied
the
other
you
understand
we
run
the
cattle
out
of
this
place
without
first
clipping
the
claws
of
mendoza
and
his
suppose
so
replied
bob
such
a
big
bunch
of
must
make
considerable
racket
when
on
the
but
then
that
the
only
thing
frank
remarked
else
would
hinder
us
running
off
his
chum
demanded
not
so
loud
bob
drop
down
to
the
whisper
again
why
stop
and
think
how
do
you
suppose
cattle
could
run
along
that
path
where
you
nearly
took
a
header
and
in
the
dark
too
i
should
say
so
frank
funny
now
i
think
of
that
why
to
be
sure
the
chances
are
half
of
would
drop
over
bad
enough
in
daylight
let
alone
with
that
tricky
moon
or
the
darkness
well
go
on
to
be
done
tell
you
frank
continued
scheme
is
wait
later
in
the
night
then
perhaps
find
a
chance
to
shut
the
crowd
up
in
one
of
the
cabins
that
biggest
one
it
might
be
while
some
kept
the
rustlers
there
the
rest
of
us
at
dawn
could
start
the
herd
going
once
out
of
this
valley
they
hold
us
from
driving
the
cattle
fine
frank
and
i
reckon
i
can
see
your
hand
back
of
the
hatched
it
up
between
anyhow
and
it
struck
me
as
the
greatest
thing
going
scotty
says
he
thinks
there
more
than
nine
of
the
rustlers
without
counting
the
fellow
got
already
but
gun
fighters
every
one
and
would
give
us
a
hard
battle
if
it
came
to
that
sort
of
means
got
to
hang
around
here
all
night
it
frank
that
replied
the
other
how
can
we
stand
it
for
hours
and
hours
bob
grunted
have
to
go
to
sleep
whenever
you
feel
like
it
promise
to
wake
you
up
before
the
circus
starts
frank
assured
him
if
i
could
said
bob
reproachfully
others
are
coming
in
this
direction
frank
remarked
still
keeping
his
voice
down
to
the
lowest
possible
pitch
for
asked
his
chum
says
frank
went
on
spring
is
here
that
supplies
the
camp
with
water
and
by
hanging
out
close
by
something
may
be
heard
i
can
just
catch
the
little
sound
now
that
tells
me
coming
so
be
worried
and
think
one
of
the
rustlers
creeping
up
on
glad
you
told
me
then
frank
because
it
might
have
bothered
me
some
come
to
think
of
it
i
reckon
the
spring
must
be
in
that
little
bunch
of
trees
over
yonder
it
seems
to
be
open
from
there
right
into
again
bob
you
see
it
pays
a
fellow
to
keep
his
wits
about
him
and
use
his
eyes
in
the
bargain
but
scotty
right
at
my
elbow
and
that
must
be
dad
coming
up
on
the
other
side
of
you
enough
said
they
lapsed
into
silence
bob
knew
that
several
unseen
forms
had
ranged
close
by
and
he
could
easily
understand
that
these
were
the
balance
of
the
circle
ranch
cow
puncher
outfit
carrying
out
the
directions
given
by
their
employer
bob
had
been
idly
watching
the
camp
which
was
not
far
away
when
he
suddenly
became
aware
of
the
fact
that
a
single
figure
had
issued
from
among
the
tents
and
cabins
and
was
approaching
he
nudged
his
chum
as
though
to
call
his
attention
to
the
fact
see
him
whispered
frank
unless
i
miss
my
guess
that
is
mendoza
himself
heard
him
described
often
enough
to
he
coming
this
way
for
asked
bob
a
little
nervous
at
hearing
such
information
and
with
his
eyes
still
glued
to
the
approaching
figure
of
the
mexican
it
up
frank
replied
the
spring
is
over
yonder
and
perhaps
he
wants
a
nice
cool
drink
after
smoking
so
much
watch
and
it
be
great
if
some
of
the
boys
and
scotty
could
capture
him
while
bending
down
to
drink
said
bob
stunt
assented
frank
hardly
possible
too
close
to
the
camp
and
the
first
cry
would
upset
everything
wait
and
see
what
again
frank
i
see
another
man
has
started
out
after
him
and
as
sure
as
you
live
bob
we
ought
to
know
that
looks
like
an
indian
to
me
whispered
the
kentucky
lad
is
an
indian
and
one
belonging
to
the
moqui
tribe
up
near
the
grand
canyon
too
look
again
bob
what
do
you
say
now
declare
queer
said
the
other
you
think
you
know
him
do
you
bob
what
could
old
havasupai
be
doing
down
here
among
the
rustlers
when
we
left
him
headed
back
for
his
village
bob
ventured
and
think
again
bob
you
remember
when
we
first
made
his
acquaintance
the
old
fellow
was
about
to
steal
one
of
our
horses
when
we
caught
him
he
claimed
that
he
was
fleeing
from
his
people
because
he
had
done
something
that
made
him
an
outcast
perhaps
when
he
went
back
they
kicked
him
out
again
and
in
the
end
just
fallen
in
with
these
wild
old
havasupai
as
sure
as
anything
frank
goes
but
drop
out
now
bob
getting
too
close
for
us
to
whisper
any
more
just
keep
your
ears
open
and
perhaps
hear
something
worth
while
that
may
explain
things
silence
now
the
leading
figure
had
reached
a
point
close
to
the
clump
of
small
trees
from
which
the
sound
of
running
water
proceeded
bob
had
seen
the
mexican
look
back
several
times
as
though
he
knew
the
other
was
following
him
but
he
manifested
no
sign
of
fear
entering
among
the
trees
he
was
gone
for
a
couple
of
minutes
during
which
time
he
undoubtedly
quenched
his
thirst
meanwhile
the
indian
drew
near
he
did
not
attempt
to
enter
the
copse
but
waited
for
the
mexican
to
come
into
view
again
it
might
have
been
dangerous
for
anyone
to
follow
pedro
mendoza
into
the
shadows
for
he
was
suspicious
of
all
men
and
their
intentions
when
mendoza
if
the
mexican
were
really
that
person
came
forth
once
more
he
found
the
old
indian
waiting
for
him
what
do
you
want
with
me
havasupai
he
asked
in
an
irritated
tone
as
though
the
interview
did
not
promise
to
give
him
any
too
much
pleasure
bob
was
surprised
to
hear
him
speak
such
good
english
for
most
of
the
mexicans
whom
he
had
met
thus
far
had
a
sort
of
patois
of
their
own
in
which
spanish
words
and
phrases
were
mixed
with
american
but
then
he
had
felt
the
same
way
when
he
heard
the
moqui
indian
talk
until
he
remembered
that
for
years
havasupai
had
come
in
contact
with
tourists
and
in
one
way
or
another
picked
up
considerable
information
as
well
as
the
speech
of
the
whites
moons
ago
the
white
wolf
came
and
took
the
daughter
of
havasupai
away
from
the
lodges
of
her
people
the
moqui
began
antelope
went
willingly
because
she
would
be
the
squaw
of
the
white
man
now
havasupai
is
sent
away
to
live
or
die
like
a
dog
because
he
has
broken
the
laws
of
the
moquis
and
he
would
see
again
the
face
of
his
child
before
he
passes
to
the
land
of
the
the
reason
you
hunted
me
up
was
it
old
man
said
the
mexican
with
a
short
ugly
laugh
you
told
me
what
had
happened
to
make
you
an
exile
i
thought
at
first
you
only
wanted
shelter
and
food
your
daughter
is
far
from
here
down
in
my
country
and
as
i
care
to
have
you
meddling
around
i
refuse
to
tell
you
where
she
can
be
found
go
back
to
your
people
or
jump
into
the
sacred
river
for
all
of
me
but
see
antelope
again
you
never
will
get
out
of
my
way
bob
thought
at
first
the
old
chief
was
about
to
throw
himself
on
the
insulting
mexican
whatever
was
in
the
mind
of
the
moqui
exile
he
seemed
to
hold
himself
in
check
the
mexican
walked
on
back
to
the
camp
never
dreaming
what
lay
in
those
shadows
close
by
while
the
indian
wandering
still
closer
to
where
the
circle
ranch
cowboys
lay
sat
down
on
a
rock
as
though
to
meditate
upon
his
gloomy
outlook
chapter
xi
just
before
the
moon
set
bob
knew
that
his
chum
had
been
wriggling
past
him
for
some
little
time
and
he
guessed
that
frank
wanted
to
communicate
with
his
father
now
the
kentucky
lad
could
hear
them
whispering
in
the
lowest
possible
tones
he
wondered
that
the
old
moqui
squatted
so
close
by
did
not
catch
sounds
that
might
arouse
his
suspicions
but
on
looking
again
bob
saw
that
he
still
sat
there
on
the
rock
his
navajo
blanket
drawn
about
his
head
the
picture
of
woe
as
though
the
whole
world
had
turned
against
him
it
might
be
the
ears
of
havasupai
were
getting
old
and
he
did
not
hear
as
keenly
as
could
a
young
warrior
or
possibly
he
was
so
wrapped
up
in
his
bitter
reflections
that
he
gave
small
heed
to
anything
that
was
passing
then
again
it
would
be
easy
to
mistake
the
whispering
of
frank
and
his
father
for
the
twittering
of
the
birds
disturbed
on
their
roosts
just
why
frank
wanted
to
confer
with
his
father
bob
of
course
was
unable
to
understand
he
found
himself
wondering
whether
the
unexpected
presence
of
this
old
friend
might
not
have
something
to
do
with
his
move
frank
was
quick
to
see
an
advantage
and
use
it
when
he
believed
it
would
serve
his
purpose
and
as
bob
still
lay
there
in
his
rather
uncomfortable
attitude
waiting
for
something
to
happen
whereby
the
conditions
might
be
changed
he
heard
a
low
cautious
voice
which
he
recognized
as
that
of
his
chum
softly
calling
the
gay
blanket
moved
and
the
head
of
the
old
moqui
came
into
view
calls
the
lonely
one
he
asked
in
steady
tones
as
though
not
quite
sure
whether
he
were
dreaming
or
hearing
the
voice
of
manitou
this
way
where
you
see
the
branch
shaking
it
is
a
friend
frank
the
boy
you
met
in
the
grand
canyon
i
want
to
talk
with
soft
as
the
words
were
spoken
they
reached
the
ear
of
the
indian
he
immediately
gained
his
feet
there
was
no
such
thing
as
fear
about
havasupai
for
without
the
slightest
hesitation
he
started
directly
toward
the
spot
where
the
quivering
branch
guided
his
steps
then
a
figure
rose
up
to
meet
him
as
he
entered
the
dense
shadows
he
recognized
frank
and
put
out
his
dusky
and
withered
palm
with
the
indian
salutation
in
a
whisper
chief
frank
said
as
he
took
the
hand
of
the
moqui
we
want
the
rustlers
to
know
we
are
here
they
have
stolen
my
cattle
and
we
have
come
to
get
them
back
even
if
we
have
to
fight
for
the
old
indian
grunted
evidently
he
could
easily
comprehend
the
situation
for
he
must
know
what
occupation
the
man
followed
who
had
carried
his
daughter
away
from
the
lodges
of
her
people
and
now
refused
to
let
him
see
her
face
for
the
very
last
time
he
had
already
seen
that
there
were
many
others
in
hiding
close
by
men
who
were
dressed
as
cattle
drivers
and
who
carried
arms
which
they
evidently
knew
how
to
use
you
can
help
us
chief
frank
went
on
and
from
this
bob
knew
that
it
was
about
this
matter
his
chum
and
the
colonel
had
been
whispering
frank
much
friend
havasupai
long
go
not
forget
how
can
help
was
what
the
old
moqui
said
heard
what
the
rustler
said
to
you
frank
went
on
eagerly
though
carefully
scorns
you
because
your
people
have
sent
you
out
to
die
like
a
dog
or
a
coyote
help
us
to
trap
mendoza
and
his
men
we
would
shut
them
up
in
the
cabins
while
we
run
off
our
stock
and
as
you
are
allowed
in
the
camp
you
might
be
of
great
help
to
us
will
you
do
it
havasupai
if
we
win
out
my
father
says
he
will
look
after
you
and
see
to
it
that
you
find
antelope
the
old
moqui
did
not
hesitate
anyone
who
would
promise
that
was
his
friend
besides
he
doubtless
secretly
hated
and
despised
mendoza
and
would
be
glad
to
see
him
tricked
me
what
to
do
frank
havasupai
knows
your
tongue
is
straight
he
will
trust
you
he
answered
is
my
father
the
boy
went
on
owns
the
circle
ranch
stock
farm
come
a
little
further
into
the
bushes
where
you
can
speak
with
him
we
must
be
careful
not
to
be
heard
by
any
of
those
in
the
upon
that
invitation
the
indian
folded
his
blanket
calmly
about
him
and
stalked
in
among
the
bushes
he
did
not
know
what
sort
of
reception
might
await
him
but
he
was
a
seasoned
warrior
and
could
not
flinch
from
danger
from
the
time
he
could
pull
a
he
had
been
accustomed
to
looking
peril
in
the
face
and
smiling
at
its
terrors
in
his
old
age
then
it
could
not
be
expected
that
his
nature
would
change
for
a
long
time
he
remained
there
holding
a
conversation
with
colonel
haywood
and
scotty
perhaps
the
leaders
of
the
cowboys
picked
up
more
or
less
valuable
information
through
this
channel
for
the
indian
was
willing
to
turn
upon
the
man
who
had
treated
him
so
scurvily
bob
had
settled
down
to
watching
again
when
he
saw
a
figure
leave
the
shelter
of
the
thicket
and
head
straight
for
the
camp
of
course
he
knew
that
this
was
the
old
moqui
no
danger
of
havasupai
betraying
their
presence
that
promise
of
the
stockman
in
connection
with
finding
his
daughter
for
him
would
serve
to
hold
him
loyal
even
if
gratitude
toward
the
two
boys
for
what
they
had
done
before
was
lacking
in
his
breast
time
do
you
think
it
can
be
frank
asked
bob
when
his
chum
once
again
cuddled
down
alongside
him
the
prairie
boy
through
instinct
cast
his
eyes
upwards
he
was
able
to
tell
what
bob
wanted
to
know
by
the
position
of
the
moon
had
that
been
lacking
then
the
star
that
trembled
above
the
to
the
west
would
have
given
him
the
information
he
wanted
nature
holds
a
thousand
secrets
that
become
as
an
open
book
to
those
who
have
learned
how
to
read
her
signs
eleven
by
the
watch
frank
replied
readily
after
that
one
glance
up
at
the
starry
heavens
do
we
have
to
keep
this
thing
up
till
nearly
dawn
asked
the
other
i
reckon
it
quite
so
bad
as
that
replied
frank
says
we
will
draw
back
some
and
get
a
little
sleep
around
about
an
hour
before
daybreak
we
get
back
here
and
then
we
can
all
listen
for
the
signal
of
the
will
that
tell
us
frank
the
trap
is
ready
to
be
sprung
in
other
words
bob
that
the
rustlers
are
snug
in
the
there
when
we
learn
that
scotty
and
his
boys
will
creep
up
close
the
door
and
fasten
it
ditto
the
windows
and
then
be
ready
to
get
the
stock
moving
with
the
peep
of
they
be
a
hot
bunch
though
when
they
find
out
happened
to
bob
remarked
goes
without
saying
his
chum
answered
they
may
try
to
break
out
in
that
case
going
to
be
a
time
but
mendoza
is
more
cunning
than
bold
dad
says
and
he
believes
that
when
the
rustler
knows
how
in
a
fix
keep
quiet
and
let
us
run
off
the
stock
rather
than
risk
his
neck
trying
to
defend
said
we
might
get
a
little
sleep
you
frank
and
by
the
way
you
keep
on
yawning
i
can
see
you
need
it
all
right
and
as
i
hear
some
of
the
boys
making
a
move
it
looks
like
they
meant
to
follow
out
the
idea
and
get
further
away
from
the
tell
me
why
they
want
to
go
back
when
this
is
as
good
cover
as
we
can
find
anywhere
bob
asked
man
will
stay
here
to
keep
tabs
on
what
is
happening
in
camp
frank
answered
as
if
he
had
it
all
figured
out
in
his
own
mind
and
did
not
hesitate
about
posting
his
companion
safer
for
the
others
to
sleep
far
enough
away
so
if
there
happens
to
be
a
big
snorer
among
he
tell
the
rustlers
that
come
to
town
to
pay
them
a
i
see
now
and
glad
not
one
of
that
kind
the
two
chums
moved
back
with
the
rest
a
short
time
later
they
were
gathered
in
a
retired
spot
where
the
stockman
took
the
pains
to
explain
the
conditions
so
that
everyone
might
be
fully
posted
get
what
sleep
you
can
boys
he
finished
few
hours
be
long
and
when
the
right
time
comes
move
out
on
the
firing
line
once
more
try
and
keep
from
making
any
more
noise
that
you
can
help
no
telling
what
might
happen
you
know
and
i
have
heard
men
snore
loud
enough
to
almost
make
the
house
they
dropped
just
where
they
happened
to
be
at
the
time
and
each
one
after
his
own
way
sought
the
sleep
needed
to
put
them
in
shape
for
work
the
last
bob
knew
he
was
looking
up
through
the
branches
of
a
tree
at
the
bright
moon
glimpses
of
which
crept
in
through
the
interlaced
leaves
then
he
lost
himself
entirely
confident
that
those
who
kept
watch
would
see
to
it
that
no
evil
befell
the
sleepers
of
course
it
was
frank
who
gently
shook
bob
and
thus
awoke
him
left
to
himself
it
was
doubtful
when
the
kentucky
boy
would
have
opened
his
eyes
again
until
the
sun
rising
over
the
ridge
in
the
east
told
of
another
day
bob
sat
up
rubbing
his
eyes
with
his
knuckles
still
bob
remember
where
you
are
said
frank
quickly
for
he
judged
that
as
yet
the
other
did
not
realize
the
nature
of
the
situation
and
there
was
always
a
possibility
that
he
might
call
out
before
he
understood
i
had
forgotten
for
a
fact
breathed
bob
it
time
do
you
think
of
them
are
moving
and
it
woke
me
up
came
the
reply
scotty
going
around
now
and
shaking
every
sleeper
going
to
move
up
bob
see
the
moon
is
low
down
over
the
western
ridge
and
it
must
be
about
four
been
asleep
over
four
hours
then
why
it
feel
a
few
winks
remarked
bob
astonished
at
the
truth
i
feel
better
frank
and
ready
to
do
my
part
in
the
game
so
get
a
move
on
as
the
others
are
chapter
xii
bottling
up
the
rustlers
do
you
like
it
bob
as
far
as
gone
asked
frank
as
they
prepared
to
follow
after
the
others
who
were
slowly
moving
off
in
indian
file
pressing
close
to
the
earth
and
looking
not
unlike
a
string
of
great
cats
creeping
upon
their
quarry
that
a
fair
question
frank
said
the
kentucky
boy
with
a
sign
of
hesitation
in
his
low
voice
if
it
is
bound
to
answer
you
care
much
for
this
sort
of
thing
then
is
that
it
asked
the
other
between
us
honestly
then
i
seem
to
came
the
reply
see
when
i
looked
forward
to
it
the
idea
seemed
rather
fine
but
somehow
the
experience
feels
different
and
frank
i
hope
when
i
say
that
you
believe
for
a
minute
because
know
better
than
that
bob
you
mean
i
take
it
that
this
thing
of
hunting
somehow
seem
to
appeal
to
you
just
what
i
mean
frank
replied
the
other
hastily
hard
to
explain
how
i
feel
but
rather
ten
times
over
be
galloping
across
the
plains
on
my
good
old
domino
than
crawling
all
over
these
mountains
looking
for
rustlers
and
feeling
ugly
in
my
heart
because
robbed
circle
ranch
of
its
prize
you
blame
the
rest
of
us
for
wanting
to
get
those
cattle
back
again
do
you
bob
i
should
say
bob
exclaimed
with
so
much
feeling
that
his
chum
had
to
press
a
warning
finger
to
his
lips
remember
that
just
as
eager
about
turning
the
trick
as
you
can
be
only
and
there
was
a
wistful
tone
to
his
voice
now
be
awful
glad
when
frank
chuckled
softly
like
never
make
a
very
good
sheriff
or
marshal
bob
he
remarked
reckon
i
would
replied
the
other
because
got
too
soft
a
heart
but
frank
if
i
saw
the
biggest
scoundrel
that
ever
went
unpunished
nagging
a
little
chap
or
a
girl
i
think
jump
in
and
try
to
hold
him
i
know
it
old
fellow
the
other
hastened
to
declare
i
seen
you
do
just
that
same
thing
once
but
better
cut
this
talk
out
now
bob
and
get
along
because
all
gone
but
us
and
we
want
to
see
what
goes
on
whether
we
have
a
hand
in
it
or
we
do
frank
lead
the
way
the
two
saddle
boys
started
to
follow
the
rest
creeping
along
as
stealthily
as
the
best
of
them
and
heading
for
the
camp
of
the
cattle
thieves
the
night
was
near
its
close
just
as
frank
had
declared
when
mentioning
the
fact
that
it
must
be
after
four
and
the
moon
would
presently
vanish
behind
the
summit
of
the
ridge
that
marked
the
cap
of
the
western
range
of
which
thunder
mountain
was
a
part
when
frank
and
his
chum
arrived
within
seeing
distance
of
the
several
cabins
comprising
the
camp
of
the
rustlers
all
seemed
quiet
the
fires
had
been
allowed
to
die
down
so
that
there
was
only
a
little
glow
where
they
had
been
from
the
direction
of
the
big
corral
where
the
cattle
were
kept
such
sounds
as
would
indicate
the
presence
of
a
herd
could
be
heard
by
ears
accustomed
to
the
various
noises
of
a
ranch
of
course
the
boys
were
more
concerned
in
the
than
anything
else
for
it
was
in
this
quarter
the
excitement
would
presently
center
door
seems
to
be
wide
open
whispered
bob
in
his
ear
all
right
came
the
faint
reply
expected
that
because
the
night
has
been
warmer
than
usual
but
make
up
your
mind
all
been
thought
of
and
if
you
keep
your
eyes
fastened
on
that
doorway
perhaps
see
something
moving
before
frank
would
not
have
spoken
at
this
length
only
that
he
had
his
lips
close
to
the
ear
of
his
companion
and
had
anyone
been
five
feet
away
it
is
doubtful
whether
they
could
have
distinguished
his
voice
from
the
sighing
of
the
soft
night
wind
through
the
branches
of
the
cedars
or
the
aspens
near
by
as
bob
lay
there
with
his
eyes
glued
upon
the
dark
doorway
of
the
big
boylike
he
allowed
his
thoughts
to
stray
far
away
and
as
might
be
expected
he
thought
among
other
things
of
the
missing
knife
which
had
never
seemed
half
so
valuable
to
him
as
when
he
found
it
gone
what
frank
had
said
about
his
using
it
to
cut
up
the
deer
several
days
ago
appeared
to
have
made
considerable
impression
on
mind
he
was
trying
now
with
all
his
might
to
mentally
look
upon
that
scene
again
in
the
hope
that
in
this
way
he
could
follow
his
actions
and
find
out
just
what
he
had
done
with
the
knife
after
finishing
his
work
in
vain
did
he
try
however
there
seemed
to
be
just
one
place
up
to
which
he
was
able
to
carry
himself
and
there
he
stuck
every
time
but
the
minutes
were
passing
surely
it
ought
to
be
nearly
time
for
things
to
begin
happening
he
had
kept
his
eyes
on
that
open
door
but
so
far
nothing
had
rewarded
his
scrutiny
what
were
they
waiting
for
had
the
old
moqui
promised
to
make
his
appearance
to
tell
them
that
all
was
well
and
every
one
of
the
rustlers
sound
asleep
what
was
nudging
him
in
the
side
then
his
chum
evidently
wished
to
call
his
attention
to
something
that
was
taking
place
for
the
first
time
bob
had
removed
his
eyes
from
the
doorway
to
glance
around
the
camp
and
warned
by
this
signal
he
hastened
to
turn
his
attention
once
more
in
the
quarter
where
he
anticipated
discovering
something
he
was
not
disappointed
this
time
for
he
could
certainly
see
a
movement
there
the
rays
did
not
happen
to
be
shining
on
that
side
of
the
cabin
so
that
he
could
not
see
as
distinctly
as
he
would
like
but
bob
knew
that
the
object
must
be
the
figure
of
a
man
what
if
one
of
the
rustlers
had
arisen
and
thought
to
start
the
fire
for
an
early
breakfast
that
would
as
bob
expressed
it
in
his
own
mind
with
the
carefully
laid
plans
of
the
stockman
but
he
felt
pretty
certain
that
the
one
who
had
appeared
in
the
doorway
must
be
the
moqui
warrior
his
actions
indicated
stealth
and
a
desire
to
keep
from
doing
anything
calculated
to
arouse
the
sleepers
looking
closer
bob
believed
he
could
see
the
unknown
one
closing
the
heavy
door
of
the
this
caused
him
to
remember
what
had
passed
through
his
mind
at
the
time
he
scrutinized
this
same
building
when
the
glow
of
the
fires
lighted
it
up
it
had
reminded
him
of
a
fort
with
its
heavy
log
walls
stout
shutters
that
could
be
fastened
over
the
windows
and
cumbersome
door
perhaps
in
building
it
the
rustlers
may
have
had
some
such
idea
in
view
they
were
at
war
with
the
cowmen
of
the
country
and
at
any
time
might
find
themselves
attacked
by
a
force
of
indignant
cowboys
ready
to
avenge
the
daring
raids
of
the
past
at
such
a
time
a
fortress
in
the
valley
was
apt
to
prove
of
considerable
value
and
might
save
their
lives
yes
the
man
in
the
shadows
had
now
closed
the
door
beyond
all
doubt
he
seemed
to
be
doing
something
more
which
bob
could
easily
imagine
must
mean
that
he
was
fastening
a
stout
rope
in
such
a
way
that
those
within
would
be
powerless
to
open
the
door
bob
remembered
the
small
openings
that
served
as
windows
how
could
they
be
secured
against
the
exit
of
the
rustlers
aroused
by
the
lowing
of
the
herd
after
it
was
put
in
motion
or
even
before
strange
how
a
sly
fox
should
venture
so
near
the
camp
even
at
this
still
hour
of
the
night
or
could
that
little
bark
have
come
from
the
lips
of
the
indian
to
serve
as
a
signal
on
whispered
frank
in
his
ear
and
immediately
bob
jumped
to
the
conclusion
that
his
guess
was
the
truth
after
all
and
that
it
had
been
the
moqui
who
so
closely
imitated
the
call
of
the
red
fox
figures
arose
here
and
there
the
eager
cowboys
had
been
waiting
for
this
sound
with
a
fever
in
their
blood
but
there
was
no
confusion
no
stumbling
as
they
swiftly
advanced
ready
to
take
a
hand
in
the
game
colonel
haywood
and
scotty
had
made
all
arrangements
beforehand
each
man
knew
exactly
what
was
expected
of
him
and
they
moved
like
the
parts
of
a
well
oiled
machine
there
were
two
of
those
small
openings
one
on
either
side
of
the
cabin
the
heavy
wooden
shutters
could
be
closed
easily
enough
but
being
intended
for
fastening
inside
it
was
not
so
easy
to
make
them
secure
from
without
two
heavy
posts
that
had
been
chopped
for
some
purpose
by
the
rustlers
having
caught
the
eye
of
the
stockman
he
judged
they
would
be
just
the
thing
to
hold
the
shutters
closed
if
placed
in
a
slanting
position
from
without
bob
saw
men
run
lightly
forward
pick
up
these
posts
and
after
the
shutters
had
been
quietly
swung
over
plant
the
braces
in
such
a
way
that
no
effort
from
within
could
displace
them
and
it
seemed
to
him
this
had
hardly
been
accomplished
before
there
came
a
shout
from
inside
the
cabin
that
told
of
alarm
chapter
xiii
the
prisoners
of
the
that
one
yell
was
immediately
followed
by
others
from
inside
the
cabin
then
came
a
tremendous
thumping
on
the
door
accompanied
by
more
outcries
the
cowboys
without
not
being
able
to
hold
themselves
in
check
any
longer
started
to
shoot
and
the
rattle
of
firearms
was
the
first
sign
that
told
the
prisoners
of
the
something
of
the
truth
colonel
haywood
knew
that
he
was
dealing
with
desperate
men
he
realized
that
nothing
must
be
neglected
in
the
effort
to
hold
them
prisoners
until
the
cattle
had
been
driven
out
of
the
mountains
and
within
the
zone
of
safety
upon
the
door
of
the
cabin
he
pounded
with
the
butt
end
of
a
revolver
he
called
in
a
tone
of
authority
the
clamor
both
within
and
without
ceased
as
if
by
magic
the
rustlers
were
consumed
with
a
burning
desire
to
know
what
it
all
meant
on
the
other
hand
scotty
and
the
rest
of
the
punchers
knew
that
their
employer
wished
to
give
the
leader
of
the
rustlers
warning
calls
me
came
from
within
and
bob
knew
that
it
was
the
chief
rustler
who
spoke
although
bitter
anger
filled
his
voice
is
colonel
haywood
mendoza
you
know
me
continued
the
stockman
a
laugh
greeted
the
announcement
you
have
come
to
reclaim
your
strays
is
that
it
colonel
haywood
mocked
the
mexican
they
are
all
safe
but
a
few
heifers
that
grew
dizzy
climbing
along
the
trail
and
dropped
over
but
you
will
never
take
them
out
of
this
going
to
make
a
big
try
for
it
just
as
soon
as
daylight
comes
and
mark
my
words
mendoza
the
men
who
try
to
oppose
us
are
going
to
get
hurt
the
stockman
continued
sternly
and
see
who
laughs
last
mocked
the
other
think
got
us
shut
up
here
like
rats
in
a
trap
perhaps
you
mean
to
keep
guard
over
us
until
the
last
of
the
steers
has
been
safely
run
out
of
the
hills
those
belonging
to
us
as
well
as
your
own
are
good
at
guessing
mendoza
replied
the
stockman
that
is
exactly
what
we
plan
to
you
think
we
will
tamely
stay
in
here
while
you
are
robbing
us
of
our
property
we
who
are
armed
and
do
not
know
the
meaning
of
the
word
fear
senor
you
have
another
guess
coming
continued
the
man
behind
the
door
the
same
colonel
haywood
went
on
sternly
one
of
your
men
will
dare
show
his
face
outside
that
cabin
until
those
i
leave
here
on
guard
hear
the
signal
that
we
have
reached
the
plain
with
the
herd
they
have
orders
to
shoot
mendoza
and
to
make
every
bullet
count
it
is
a
long
score
they
have
to
settle
with
you
and
if
you
are
wise
you
will
hesitate
to
give
them
the
chance
they
have
been
waiting
for
these
many
the
rustler
chief
laughed
again
like
the
sound
of
that
laugh
bob
said
to
frank
as
the
two
stood
where
no
stray
shot
from
the
besieged
cabin
might
reach
them
it
makes
me
think
of
a
hyena
i
once
saw
at
a
circus
when
he
howled
it
sent
the
cold
creeps
up
and
down
my
here
admitted
frank
say
mendoza
is
as
sly
as
any
fox
that
ever
crept
into
a
hen
house
and
carried
off
a
fat
prize
with
all
sorts
of
traps
set
to
catch
him
somehow
i
just
get
rid
of
the
notion
that
while
we
seem
to
have
him
in
a
pickle
right
now
got
a
string
he
means
to
pull
going
to
surprise
us
you
make
me
feel
bad
frank
declared
the
other
hope
mistaken
about
that
but
listen
to
the
racket
kicking
up
inside
there
do
you
think
break
out
and
tackle
our
fellows
much
they
laughed
frank
know
what
cowboys
are
once
they
get
their
guns
going
and
remember
they
have
no
idea
how
many
of
us
there
are
how
can
they
tell
that
there
are
not
forty
fellows
here
just
waiting
for
them
to
break
out
all
put
on
for
show
the
pounding
and
shouting
asked
bob
snorted
frank
have
to
make
a
bluff
of
being
hungry
to
get
at
our
crowd
but
all
the
same
you
mark
my
word
be
some
time
before
the
first
rustler
shows
even
the
tip
of
his
nose
where
scotty
or
any
of
our
boys
can
get
a
crack
at
am
i
right
and
is
that
the
first
peep
of
dawn
over
yonder
in
the
east
mistake
about
that
my
boy
morning
is
close
at
hand
and
before
another
hour
i
reckon
be
pushing
the
herd
over
the
back
trail
frank
replied
will
be
several
men
left
here
to
hold
the
rustlers
in
the
cabin
is
that
the
programme
frank
what
and
you
can
easily
understand
that
they
will
be
men
chosen
for
their
staying
qualities
frank
answered
you
know
going
to
be
something
of
a
ticklish
job
because
when
once
they
get
the
signal
and
quit
here
the
rustlers
will
burrow
out
in
no
time
and
being
wild
for
revenge
chase
after
the
boys
and
give
them
a
running
fight
all
through
the
mountain
about
them
shooting
now
through
cracks
or
holes
in
the
cabin
walls
asked
the
kentucky
boy
might
replied
his
chum
reckon
got
some
here
and
there
for
just
that
purpose
but
if
they
know
good
for
them
go
slow
about
wounding
any
of
our
boys
dad
can
hardly
hold
the
fellows
in
now
and
it
would
only
take
one
match
to
set
off
the
magazine
and
no
telling
what
terrible
things
would
happen
goes
your
father
and
bart
now
toward
the
corral
bob
remarked
and
some
of
the
boys
trailing
after
frank
added
looks
like
they
expected
to
get
the
herd
in
motion
as
soon
as
the
trail
can
be
easily
seen
dad
is
just
wild
to
drive
his
stock
clear
of
this
valley
though
some
day
i
expect
be
wanting
to
use
it
on
his
own
hook
after
the
rustlers
have
been
driven
out
of
this
part
of
the
country
because
a
boss
place
to
winter
a
go
with
the
punchers
who
will
drive
i
suppose
frank
we
do
replied
the
other
a
little
regretfully
tried
to
coax
dad
to
let
us
stay
back
but
he
just
hear
of
for
one
glad
he
say
yes
bob
spoke
promptly
feel
that
like
to
stay
here
and
have
a
hand
in
that
game
of
hide
and
seek
you
say
will
take
place
when
the
siege
of
the
is
raised
and
the
rustlers
rush
out
like
a
swarm
of
angry
bees
no
i
think
be
happier
driving
the
herd
though
if
they
came
up
with
us
and
tried
to
take
the
cattle
back
i
hope
fight
like
a
true
kentuckian
once
we
strike
the
level
with
the
herd
see
no
more
of
the
rustlers
frank
assured
him
confidently
more
you
can
take
it
from
me
that
as
soon
as
dad
gets
home
stir
up
all
the
stockmen
in
this
part
of
the
state
going
to
get
too
warm
for
mendoza
and
his
crowd
on
this
side
of
the
border
and
have
to
vamoose
if
they
want
to
keep
once
at
the
corral
the
boys
found
that
as
daylight
came
on
the
cowboys
were
getting
busy
indeed
they
recognized
the
best
part
of
the
herd
as
their
property
but
besides
these
there
seemed
to
be
fully
as
many
other
cattle
mendoza
had
claimed
these
as
his
lawful
possession
but
no
one
believed
him
for
it
was
found
that
in
every
case
the
brands
on
cattle
had
been
altered
only
a
few
partly
grown
animals
bore
the
single
star
that
seemed
to
be
the
trade
mark
of
the
hidden
valley
ranch
the
last
the
boys
saw
of
the
all
appeared
serene
there
no
doubt
the
inmates
were
watching
through
cracks
and
holes
to
see
what
the
cowboys
were
doing
but
thus
far
they
had
made
no
serious
attempt
to
force
a
way
out
knowing
as
they
did
that
a
number
of
good
shots
were
posted
behind
the
other
cabin
ready
to
give
them
a
very
hot
reception
upon
their
appearance
it
was
now
light
enough
to
make
a
start
and
the
cries
of
the
cowboys
began
to
cause
a
movement
in
the
herd
the
barbed
wire
corral
had
been
cut
so
that
the
animals
were
easily
driven
forth
and
headed
on
the
trail
that
would
in
a
short
time
bring
the
vanguard
to
the
neck
of
the
narrow
pass
through
which
they
must
apparently
proceed
in
order
to
leave
the
valley
all
seemed
to
be
going
smoothly
and
the
boys
who
were
keeping
pretty
much
together
could
see
nothing
menacing
in
the
conditions
around
them
the
country
was
exceedingly
wild
and
a
few
daring
men
would
be
able
to
break
up
the
drive
could
they
be
posted
on
the
slope
of
the
mountain
but
the
boys
felt
sure
that
all
the
rustlers
except
the
vidette
who
had
been
first
captured
were
shut
up
in
the
and
hence
beyond
power
of
doing
any
harm
still
somehow
bob
could
not
quite
get
that
scornful
laugh
as
well
as
the
mocking
words
of
mendoza
out
of
his
mind
meant
something
by
it
sure
of
that
he
was
saying
to
himself
for
the
fifth
time
at
least
as
he
stalked
along
doing
his
share
of
driving
the
herd
toward
the
outlet
of
the
secret
valley
back
of
thunder
mountain
this
being
on
foot
galled
the
cowboys
very
much
if
there
is
anything
a
puncher
dislikes
it
is
being
compelled
to
play
his
part
without
a
horse
habit
so
accustoms
him
to
being
mounted
that
he
really
seems
to
be
a
part
of
his
steed
once
he
flings
himself
across
the
back
minutes
more
and
we
ought
to
have
the
leaders
starting
through
that
little
gap
we
frank
bob
asked
after
a
time
what
we
ought
the
other
replied
and
hardly
had
he
spoken
before
he
staggered
back
while
bob
almost
fell
over
with
the
shock
it
seemed
to
the
two
boys
as
though
the
cap
of
thunder
mountain
long
suspected
of
having
been
a
volcano
centuries
in
the
past
had
been
blown
by
some
tremendous
internal
force
there
was
a
heavy
blast
that
seemed
to
make
the
very
earth
quiver
under
their
feet
the
cattle
bellowed
and
shrank
fearfully
into
a
compact
mass
refusing
to
go
further
along
the
trail
and
the
loud
cries
of
the
cowboys
told
that
they
too
had
been
astounded
by
the
explosion
that
seemed
so
mysterious
chapter
xiv
shut
in
earthquake
perhaps
after
all
it
was
not
so
very
strange
that
bob
should
give
utterance
to
this
exclamation
he
had
been
thrown
to
the
ground
and
with
considerable
violence
too
the
consequence
of
this
rough
treatment
was
a
shortage
of
breath
as
he
began
to
scramble
to
his
feet
again
though
even
this
did
not
prevent
his
excited
outcry
the
cattle
had
been
frightened
by
the
sudden
fearful
noise
and
the
trembling
of
the
earth
they
were
bellowing
madly
and
showing
all
the
signs
that
generally
go
before
a
stampede
the
instinct
of
a
stockman
must
have
overcome
the
alarm
colonel
haywood
naturally
experienced
himself
at
this
unexpected
happening
busy
boys
he
shouted
care
of
the
stock
first
get
them
milling
or
have
a
stampede
and
lose
the
whole
bunch
the
nearest
cowboy
passed
the
word
on
to
the
next
above
the
racket
then
arose
the
cheery
cries
of
the
drivers
as
they
started
upon
the
customary
tactics
to
get
the
animals
wheeling
in
a
circle
so
as
to
prevent
a
mad
rush
there
was
no
succeeding
shock
after
that
one
crash
there
came
a
silence
birds
that
had
been
singing
in
the
trees
flew
wildly
away
but
their
songs
were
hushed
here
and
there
an
animal
could
be
seen
dashing
away
or
slinking
through
the
underbrush
as
though
half
dazed
by
the
concussion
presently
it
was
seen
much
to
the
relief
of
frank
and
bob
who
were
doing
their
best
to
assist
that
the
cattle
had
been
held
they
were
moving
in
a
big
circle
after
the
most
approved
methods
of
the
range
and
doing
it
in
spite
of
the
limited
open
space
at
the
command
of
the
cowboy
band
danger
is
past
anyhow
frank
remarked
as
he
wiped
the
perspiration
from
his
forehead
we
may
have
another
shock
frank
said
bob
nervously
as
he
looked
upward
toward
the
peak
of
thunder
mountain
say
these
things
never
go
singly
and
the
first
shake
always
the
hardest
of
the
lot
either
but
i
see
any
smoke
hanging
over
the
cap
up
there
frank
echoed
the
other
boy
looking
puzzled
yes
always
a
lot
of
it
you
know
when
a
volcano
starts
to
knocking
things
around
bob
went
on
it
was
a
strange
time
to
laugh
but
all
the
same
frank
seemed
unable
to
keep
from
doing
it
the
idea
got
is
it
bob
he
demanded
it
is
and
from
what
i
heard
some
of
the
boys
call
out
i
reckon
not
the
only
one
to
believe
it
bob
made
answer
without
hesitation
you
see
any
smoke
up
yonder
around
the
top
of
our
old
friend
thunder
mountain
eh
asked
frank
there
was
any
cleared
away
the
other
continued
i
take
it
would
be
queer
because
once
they
start
to
pour
out
ashes
lava
and
fire
these
volcanoes
keep
it
up
for
days
and
seems
to
me
the
cap
still
fits
snug
up
there
bob
it
look
like
anything
had
happened
to
blow
it
into
a
thousand
pieces
as
far
as
i
can
what
sets
me
to
wondering
frank
but
you
act
as
if
you
took
any
stock
in
the
idea
to
tell
the
honest
truth
bob
i
declared
frank
it
have
been
that
geyser
in
the
mountain
could
it
bob
went
on
should
say
not
no
geyser
in
the
world
or
a
dozen
of
the
biggest
together
could
have
made
all
that
fierce
row
and
shaken
the
earth
as
we
felt
it
tremble
but
bob
though
i
happen
to
smoke
for
i
was
tumbled
down
just
as
you
were
i
have
it
since
have
burst
out
the
kentucky
lad
eagerly
that
proves
my
idea
it
frank
returned
the
other
dryly
the
first
place
notice
that
the
wind
happen
to
be
coming
from
the
direction
of
thunder
mountain
at
all
and
smoke
reach
us
from
there
straight
ahead
in
the
direction
of
the
little
gap
or
pass
we
took
to
get
into
this
valley
and
through
which
all
cattle
have
to
be
driven
to
enter
or
leave
burst
from
lips
as
he
seemed
to
grasp
something
of
what
his
chum
was
hinting
thing
frank
went
on
was
something
about
the
smell
of
that
same
smoke
to
remind
me
of
powder
dynamite
or
such
things
and
not
the
gas
they
say
always
comes
with
an
outbreak
from
a
bob
stared
at
him
so
great
was
his
astonishment
that
his
mouth
even
opened
and
frank
was
forced
to
smile
at
the
picture
his
chum
presented
ejaculated
bob
frank
you
believe
that
awful
explosion
was
caused
by
human
hands
and
not
nature
is
that
it
frank
nodded
the
smash
of
a
volcano
breaking
loose
bob
went
on
voicing
his
surprise
be
drowned
or
burned
to
cinders
in
a
flood
of
lava
flowing
down
the
side
of
the
even
a
fierce
landslide
carried
away
half
the
old
ridge
but
just
an
miners
perhaps
blown
up
with
all
their
stuff
on
there
going
a
step
too
far
bob
i
never
had
miners
in
my
head
when
i
said
that
frank
remarked
who
else
would
carry
explosives
around
with
them
and
carelessly
let
the
whole
outfit
go
up
in
one
big
smash
demanded
bob
mendoza
for
one
the
other
said
quietly
the
rustler
echoed
bob
frank
you
must
be
joking
because
shut
up
in
that
good
and
tight
how
could
mendoza
get
ahead
of
us
to
the
pass
and
touch
off
that
big
mine
even
as
bob
was
saying
this
the
expression
on
his
face
changed
some
sudden
idea
had
found
a
speedy
lodgement
in
his
mind
and
without
waiting
for
his
chum
to
make
any
reply
to
his
question
he
went
on
now
i
see
what
you
mean
frank
he
must
have
had
a
mine
planted
connected
with
his
old
cabin
by
a
wire
and
a
battery
he
fired
the
charge
from
there
is
that
what
you
want
to
tell
me
frank
what
i
believe
replied
the
other
firmly
why
would
he
do
that
frank
do
you
think
the
miserable
coward
expected
to
blow
us
all
up
demanded
bob
with
considerable
heat
i
know
about
that
frank
went
on
slowly
as
though
loath
to
believe
the
mexican
could
be
so
vindictive
i
do
think
mendoza
wants
to
close
the
neck
of
the
bottle
here
so
that
dad
take
his
cattle
out
of
this
sounds
just
like
all
heard
of
mendoza
cried
bob
put
it
past
him
one
minute
but
frank
he
took
big
chances
of
blowing
us
up
at
the
same
time
if
been
closer
we
might
have
been
hit
by
some
of
the
rocks
i
heard
falling
like
hail
all
around
was
our
lookout
and
mendoza
going
to
trouble
himself
about
making
sure
none
of
us
were
hurt
stop
and
think
bob
remember
how
he
told
dad
with
one
of
his
laughs
how
we
would
never
take
the
stock
out
of
this
valley
well
he
believes
fixed
it
that
way
right
now
in
a
nice
pickle
we
lamented
the
other
saddle
boy
blown
that
little
pass
into
a
ruin
and
cut
off
our
only
way
for
going
out
never
get
the
cattle
is
a
long
time
bob
just
wait
till
my
dad
gets
to
work
he
always
rises
to
his
best
when
in
a
hole
like
this
there
he
is
coming
this
way
with
bart
and
scotty
perhaps
he
caught
on
as
well
as
i
did
so
join
them
to
find
it
proved
however
that
colonel
haywood
had
guessed
the
true
solution
of
that
fearful
explosion
just
as
his
son
had
through
smelling
the
smoke
and
putting
several
things
together
he
had
been
telling
the
others
his
opinion
and
scotty
was
getting
ready
to
push
his
way
forward
in
order
to
investigate
the
others
would
all
be
needed
to
keep
the
cattle
quiet
though
by
degrees
the
fright
of
the
animals
was
wearing
off
as
they
heard
the
reassuring
calls
of
the
cow
punchers
around
them
for
a
short
time
the
party
exchanged
ideas
and
the
stockman
was
pleased
to
find
that
frank
had
appreciated
the
situation
so
fully
soon
as
i
can
spare
a
man
i
mean
to
send
him
back
to
the
camp
the
stockman
remarked
two
fellows
will
be
wondering
what
terrible
thing
has
happened
and
not
hearing
anything
from
us
might
be
tempted
to
give
over
guarding
the
rustlers
it
would
only
add
to
our
troubles
if
the
thieves
broke
loose
and
started
to
play
a
game
hiding
along
the
side
of
the
mountain
and
pestering
us
with
their
fire
but
first
scotty
go
ahead
and
find
out
if
what
we
suspect
is
accordingly
the
cowboy
started
off
duty
with
him
took
the
lead
above
everything
else
no
matter
what
might
lie
beyond
once
scotty
had
his
orders
he
stood
ready
to
obey
bart
hurried
back
to
assist
his
men
in
keeping
the
herd
intact
until
they
could
decide
on
their
next
move
which
would
not
be
until
the
skirmisher
had
reported
the
pass
has
been
blown
up
what
will
we
do
then
asked
bob
depends
on
how
bad
the
wreck
is
replied
the
stockman
calmly
it
is
possible
to
dig
a
passage
in
a
reasonable
time
we
may
start
to
if
out
of
the
question
sir
will
we
have
to
abandon
the
herd
after
all
our
fine
work
tracking
them
here
bob
went
on
plainly
disturbed
cross
that
bridge
till
we
come
to
it
the
colonel
said
with
a
tightening
of
his
lips
that
frank
knew
of
old
you
can
depend
on
it
my
boy
never
abandon
my
cattle
so
long
as
any
chance
to
save
them
our
fall
is
due
shortly
now
and
feel
pretty
blue
if
of
my
whole
stock
had
been
abandoned
up
here
to
be
slaughtered
by
these
rustlers
in
revenge
after
we
left
for
if
we
get
them
out
they
would
be
in
the
same
fix
i
reckon
you
mean
sir
bob
suggested
and
mendoza
would
rather
kill
every
steer
and
cow
and
yearling
than
know
they
had
fallen
into
my
hands
again
but
scotty
ought
to
be
back
here
very
soon
now
when
we
will
at
least
know
the
worst
and
the
stockman
looked
anxiously
up
the
valley
in
the
direction
where
he
knew
the
pass
lay
something
moving
right
now
dad
cried
frank
whose
keen
vision
had
enabled
him
to
catch
sight
of
the
object
before
any
one
else
scotty
all
right
pursued
colonel
haywood
making
motions
cowboy
fashion
and
i
like
the
news
sending
me
it
looks
like
up
against
it
good
and
mean
he
is
telling
you
the
pass
has
been
blown
up
sir
asked
bob
as
if
that
must
be
what
he
means
but
wait
till
he
gets
here
and
know
the
worst
concluded
the
rancher
his
set
jaws
and
flashing
eyes
telling
how
the
desperate
situation
was
arousing
that
old
spirit
of
say
which
in
times
past
had
always
marked
his
work
and
been
the
means
of
his
present
success
the
cowboy
came
hurrying
along
as
fast
as
the
uneven
ground
would
permit
straight
toward
the
little
group
he
bart
the
foreman
had
again
joined
the
others
eager
to
hear
the
news
the
scout
was
bringing
back
frank
knew
before
a
word
was
spoken
that
scotty
had
made
a
disagreeable
discovery
which
would
put
them
to
great
trouble
so
far
as
getting
the
stock
out
of
the
valley
was
concerned
hence
he
was
nerved
to
hear
bad
news
about
it
scotty
asked
colonel
haywood
as
the
other
arrived
close
to
where
the
others
stood
been
worse
sir
replied
the
disgusted
cowboy
shrugging
his
broad
shoulders
the
pass
has
been
blown
up
and
filled
with
rubbish
continued
the
other
so
high
that
a
month
open
it
again
to
let
even
an
old
baldy
climb
over
sure
up
agin
it
colonel
this
time
declared
scotty
scowling
chapter
xv
hoof
points
the
way
a
bad
outlook
but
not
the
kind
to
give
up
easily
said
the
stockman
grimly
bob
who
had
been
much
dejected
by
the
news
which
the
cowboy
trailer
brought
plucked
up
fresh
hope
at
these
words
from
the
rancher
frank
too
was
able
to
grasp
at
little
rays
of
encouragement
the
worst
he
said
resolutely
might
hold
the
fort
here
and
send
for
help
some
of
the
other
stockmen
learning
that
we
had
mendoza
cooped
up
would
rush
assistance
and
in
time
we
might
clean
out
the
cried
bob
impulsively
true
the
colonel
remarked
lots
of
things
could
happen
before
that
same
help
arrived
which
would
mean
several
days
at
least
and
when
dealing
with
mendoza
you
never
can
be
sure
that
you
can
put
your
finger
on
him
when
you
think
got
him
perhaps
he
might
manage
to
slip
out
of
that
cabin
and
then
there
would
be
warm
times
around
sure
scotty
declared
with
a
shake
of
his
head
must
had
a
fierce
lot
of
dynamite
under
that
pass
you
never
did
see
such
a
lot
rocks
in
your
born
days
i
had
to
rub
my
eyes
and
pinch
myself
to
believe
there
ever
had
been
an
opening
there
through
which
we
came
into
this
here
valley
all
that
stock
always
had
a
reputation
for
doing
things
to
the
limit
remarked
the
stockman
knew
that
it
would
be
useless
damaging
the
pass
only
a
little
so
he
made
the
mine
a
big
one
i
never
heard
anything
like
that
detonation
before
but
all
try
and
think
up
some
way
of
beating
the
rustler
at
his
own
we
only
had
the
stuff
remarked
bob
we
might
clean
out
the
pass
the
same
way
he
filled
it
an
explosion
you
mean
said
frank
i
reckon
that
would
only
make
bad
worse
and
do
no
good
for
there
any
pass
there
now
under
the
rocks
if
what
scotty
tells
us
is
the
colonel
said
goes
with
me
remarked
the
foreman
mean
about
holding
the
fort
here
and
sending
for
help
asked
the
stockman
the
idea
sir
replied
bart
might
set
to
work
and
make
prisoners
of
the
rustlers
you
see
first
of
all
and
once
we
got
that
crowd
where
they
bother
us
any
we
could
stay
here
and
wait
till
help
only
there
was
some
other
way
to
get
out
of
this
queer
little
valley
said
bob
dismally
there
you
see
mendoza
would
know
about
it
and
he
always
used
the
pass
been
blowed
up
scotty
argued
not
so
sure
about
that
scotty
all
turned
and
looked
at
frank
when
he
said
this
even
his
father
seemed
surprised
to
hear
his
words
and
there
was
a
faint
smile
on
the
face
to
indicate
that
some
bright
thought
might
be
occupying
his
mind
something
with
which
he
may
have
been
wrestling
lately
while
listening
to
the
conversation
around
him
that
frank
scotty
demanded
you
seemed
so
positive
about
there
not
being
any
other
way
for
cattle
getting
out
of
here
i
just
had
to
remark
that
perhaps
you
were
how
persisted
scotty
who
always
had
to
be
shown
about
old
baldy
frank
remarked
quietly
the
colonel
uttered
an
exclamation
boy
may
be
right
he
remarked
with
some
little
excitement
never
occurred
to
me
to
remember
that
that
smart
old
chap
got
out
of
here
some
way
and
just
as
like
as
not
he
get
past
that
little
opening
which
was
kept
closed
most
of
the
time
i
he
was
brought
in
that
way
it
stand
to
reason
the
try
to
get
out
by
the
same
route
asked
the
foreman
suppose
he
would
try
admitted
the
stockman
finding
the
cork
in
the
bottle
old
baldy
might
take
a
turn
in
another
direction
and
that
makes
me
think
of
something
that
happened
years
ago
when
the
old
fellow
disappeared
one
bad
winter
and
was
gone
with
a
few
cows
for
some
months
we
gave
them
up
for
dead
when
early
in
spring
they
turned
up
on
the
range
looking
sleek
and
fat
as
if
wintered
where
there
was
plenty
of
grass
see
the
point
boys
well
i
put
it
past
that
old
baldy
to
have
found
his
way
into
this
same
fine
valley
and
stayed
here
till
the
winter
was
gone
with
its
northers
frank
declared
with
exultation
in
his
voice
for
such
a
happening
would
add
strength
to
his
suggestion
strange
as
it
had
at
first
appeared
to
the
others
if
he
happened
to
come
in
here
and
go
out
through
some
other
pass
that
even
the
rustlers
never
knew
a
thing
about
it
stand
to
reason
that
such
a
sharp
steer
would
be
able
to
find
the
way
again
even
if
years
had
passed
colonel
haywood
demanded
bart
looked
at
scotty
nodded
his
head
and
observed
never
was
such
a
critter
as
old
baldy
before
and
i
reckon
easy
remember
that
trail
course
though
it
might
be
he
went
out
through
the
regular
way
for
it
might
been
open
at
the
look
at
that
closer
said
frank
bob
and
i
first
ran
across
old
baldy
he
was
away
off
a
direct
line
between
the
mouth
of
the
canyon
and
circle
ranch
and
bart
you
must
admit
that
once
he
came
out
of
that
pass
he
would
hit
a
for
home
the
foreman
threw
up
his
hands
pass
he
declared
it
comes
to
arguing
not
in
it
with
you
answer
my
old
baldy
be
apt
to
head
straight
for
home
insisted
the
boy
he
would
every
time
admitted
bart
a
strong
point
made
son
declared
the
stockman
with
a
proud
glance
at
frank
chances
are
three
to
one
old
baldy
got
out
of
this
valley
by
some
other
trail
than
the
one
we
took
in
entering
and
which
has
just
been
blocked
by
the
rustlers
now
the
question
comes
can
we
find
that
other
exit
and
make
use
of
it
to
take
the
herd
out
this
same
way
he
had
already
sent
a
messenger
back
to
the
camp
to
tell
the
two
guards
of
the
what
had
happened
so
that
they
might
not
relax
their
vigilance
and
allow
the
prisoners
a
chance
to
escape
during
broad
daylight
that
same
is
going
to
tax
us
some
i
opine
grumbled
bart
if
we
can
only
find
the
trail
of
old
baldy
said
frank
cheerfully
trail
echoed
bob
in
dismay
as
he
looked
down
at
the
ground
which
just
at
that
point
had
been
torn
up
by
scores
of
hoofs
i
should
say
that
would
be
a
tough
old
job
just
as
bart
declared
how
can
you
do
it
frank
stop
and
think
a
minute
replied
the
other
you
remember
my
telling
you
that
old
baldy
has
a
marked
hoof
one
so
much
longer
than
any
other
steers
that
a
tracker
could
tell
it
anywhere
at
a
glance
to
be
sure
you
did
cried
bob
i
remember
that
we
thought
perhaps
scotty
might
be
able
to
follow
his
tracks
back
to
where
he
came
from
because
we
believed
even
then
he
must
have
been
in
the
hands
of
crowd
since
his
brand
had
been
burned
what
we
did
frank
remarked
before
anything
could
be
done
mendoza
made
his
raid
on
our
prize
herd
and
that
brought
us
here
on
the
jump
but
if
we
could
follow
that
marked
trail
over
the
plain
and
up
into
the
mountains
why
not
do
as
well
here
in
the
valley
you
hear
that
asked
the
stockman
bet
i
do
going
to
get
some
busy
right
the
handle
no
use
away
up
here
is
there
the
cowboy
observed
the
rancher
went
on
to
say
take
it
for
granted
that
old
baldy
first
tried
to
get
out
the
regular
way
and
finding
the
passage
blocked
by
rocks
which
a
man
might
easily
climb
over
but
a
steer
never
he
turned
around
sharp
and
put
for
that
other
exit
which
he
had
never
forgotten
in
all
these
years
so
scotty
take
a
turn
around
and
see
if
you
can
run
across
that
marked
hoof
frank
was
not
the
one
to
linger
when
anything
of
this
sort
was
going
on
after
all
he
might
chance
to
find
the
track
himself
in
the
midst
of
the
multitude
that
scoured
the
side
of
the
valley
back
toward
the
camp
called
out
the
stockman
if
either
one
finds
the
track
give
a
call
to
the
rest
keep
close
bob
himself
could
not
help
getting
down
every
little
while
to
look
at
the
torn
turf
where
scores
of
hoofs
had
cut
in
on
the
passage
of
cattle
back
and
forth
each
time
he
had
to
shake
his
head
and
smile
it
depended
on
me
to
run
old
baldy
down
i
just
reckon
the
herd
would
stay
in
here
till
doomsday
he
admitted
to
the
stockman
of
course
in
most
spots
the
cattle
coming
after
must
have
crushed
out
all
traces
of
old
declared
colonel
haywood
some
place
or
other
we
hope
that
a
single
print
may
have
escaped
all
they
need
to
tell
the
story
you
of
course
pursued
bob
wisely
can
easily
settle
which
way
the
steer
was
going
at
the
time
because
the
mark
will
be
pointing
in
that
my
boy
these
things
are
all
very
simple
once
you
get
the
cue
to
a
trailer
everything
has
its
meaning
he
reads
signs
as
we
do
print
and
known
scotty
there
to
spin
a
yarn
that
made
the
rest
of
us
think
he
was
joshing
without
ever
seeing
the
people
ahead
and
yet
when
we
came
to
prove
it
everything
was
just
as
he
had
a
wonderful
science
sir
and
i
hope
to
master
it
some
day
but
seems
to
me
i
get
on
terribly
slow
bob
said
dismally
that
is
worth
while
takes
time
remarked
the
stockman
encouragingly
tracking
be
learned
in
a
week
a
month
nor
yet
in
a
year
truth
to
tell
most
cowboys
never
do
learn
it
worth
while
it
run
in
the
blood
you
see
they
can
rope
steers
break
bucking
broncos
and
do
all
such
things
but
only
to
a
favored
few
does
the
trail
give
up
all
its
wonderful
hope
frank
gets
sight
of
the
tracks
first
said
bob
as
his
eyes
followed
the
stooping
figure
of
his
chum
longingly
must
be
a
matter
of
chance
remarked
the
other
smiling
is
a
pretty
fair
hand
at
this
business
but
of
course
not
in
the
same
class
with
scotty
still
he
may
be
lucky
enough
to
be
the
one
to
run
across
the
first
he
is
stooping
down
lower
now
sir
exclaimed
bob
with
some
excitement
in
his
voice
he
seems
to
be
a
heap
interested
in
something
do
you
think
he
will
make
a
strike
sir
acts
like
it
responded
the
stockman
himself
deeply
concerned
in
the
actions
of
his
boy
there
he
turns
back
this
way
and
waves
his
hand
and
now
he
calls
to
let
scotty
know
you
can
see
him
hurrying
to
side
so
it
looks
as
if
made
some
sort
of
together
the
ranch
owner
and
bob
hurried
forward
with
bart
close
at
their
heels
they
found
the
two
trail
hunters
with
their
heads
close
together
evidently
examining
some
track
which
frank
had
been
fortunate
enough
to
run
across
at
a
point
where
the
herd
had
failed
to
wipe
it
out
luck
boys
asked
the
stockman
as
he
came
up
has
found
old
all
right
declared
scotty
without
the
faintest
trace
of
jealousy
in
his
manner
for
he
was
very
fond
of
his
son
as
indeed
was
every
one
connected
with
circle
ranch
bob
himself
pushed
in
because
he
wanted
to
satisfy
his
mind
with
regard
to
the
direction
in
which
the
hoofprint
pointed
he
had
noted
the
peculiar
mark
at
that
other
time
when
frank
told
him
about
it
and
readily
recognized
it
now
plainly
indented
in
the
yielding
soil
at
a
spot
where
luckily
none
of
the
other
cattle
had
happened
to
tread
either
in
coming
or
going
and
bob
laughed
to
see
how
easily
that
one
point
was
settled
the
footprint
undoubtedly
pointed
toward
the
camp
and
it
was
evident
that
old
baldy
had
been
heading
in
that
quarter
when
the
mark
was
impressed
there

disputed

colonel
asked
scotty
as
he
arose
from
examining
the
print
of
old
hoof
only
one
thing
to
do
replied
the
stockman
is
to
head
back
in
the
direction
of
the
camp
watching
out
to
see
just
where
the
old
rascal
left
the
regular
trail
and
branched
out
for
himself
once
we
get
started
on
that
it
ought
to
be
easy
for
you
guess
yes
answered
the
squatty
cowboy
whose
legs
seemed
to
look
very
much
like
a
loop
partly
on
account
of
the
sheepskin
chaps
he
wore
he
took
one
side
while
frank
looked
after
the
other
in
this
fashion
then
they
all
started
toward
the
camp
down
in
the
valley
it
was
not
a
great
while
before
scotty
emitted
a
roar
she
goes
sure
as
born
and
out
in
great
shape
he
declared
as
the
others
came
up
that
old
baldy
never
did
forget
he
ever
knowed
and
here
he
goes
up
for
that
other
outlet
just
like
he
remembered
every
foot
of
the
way
come
along
colonel
it
looks
like
we
was
to
larn
mendoza
himself
ever
did
all
through
a
pesky
steer
the
others
were
well
content
to
drop
in
line
after
the
stunted
trailer
who
continued
to
move
along
with
his
eyes
constantly
watching
the
ground
frank
and
bob
came
close
in
his
rear
while
back
of
them
were
the
stockman
and
his
overseer
both
anxious
to
learn
how
the
game
turned
out
heading
up
all
the
time
one
thing
sure
remarked
bob
after
they
had
been
pushing
along
in
this
fashion
for
some
ten
minutes
at
least
you
can
see
how
wild
it
looks
up
here
frank
added
as
not
mendoza
and
his
men
never
thought
it
worth
while
to
explore
this
part
of
the
ridge
for
it
strike
them
that
cattle
could
ever
find
a
way
of
climbing
over
such
big
piles
of
rocks
but
old
baldy
has
found
a
means
of
going
in
and
out
all
and
he
knew
where
he
was
heading
for
when
he
struck
out
up
here
a
cinch
declared
bob
right
he
did
scotty
announced
with
conviction
rascal
just
wild
when
he
headed
this
way
he
had
an
object
in
you
mark
me
when
i
says
it
and
to
know
what
that
object
was
before
a
great
while
just
got
to
laughed
frank
soon
be
at
the
top
of
the
old
ridge
the
way
climbing
and
dad
if
it
turns
out
that
old
baldy
shows
us
a
new
way
out
of
the
valley
what
are
you
going
to
do
to
him
when
we
get
back
home
can
own
the
ranch
replied
the
stockman
readily
be
in
clover
for
the
rest
of
his
days
i
promise
you
the
way
grew
more
difficult
yet
no
matter
what
obstacles
seemed
to
loom
up
ahead
there
was
always
a
way
around
them
and
old
baldy
knew
the
trail
many
times
bob
lost
all
signs
and
would
have
been
compelled
to
give
up
in
despair
but
frank
pointed
out
where
a
stone
had
been
displaced
or
it
might
be
a
twig
ground
under
the
weight
of
the
heavy
steer
climbs
like
a
mountain
goat
that
baldy
declared
bob
after
an
unusually
hard
effort
that
winded
him
more
or
less
all
cattle
can
do
that
frank
assured
him
till
you
see
the
whole
herd
putting
up
this
steep
slope
even
the
youngest
will
surprise
you
by
the
way
they
hang
on
to
the
side
of
the
hill
and
climb
over
all
sorts
of
things
that
give
us
more
or
less
thing
i
notice
remarked
bob
that
asked
his
chum
get
even
an
occasional
peep
in
at
the
camp
the
big
spur
or
shoulder
of
the
mountain
that
juts
out
hides
it
and
frank
by
the
same
token
it
would
keep
any
one
down
there
from
noticing
old
baldy
if
he
climbed
this
place
in
the
right
bob
replied
the
other
think
of
that
myself
and
perhaps
the
rustlers
never
took
the
trouble
to
look
around
to
see
if
that
pass
was
the
only
way
in
and
out
you
know
a
lazy
lot
taken
as
a
whole
and
hate
to
do
the
least
thing
except
when
in
the
grunted
scotty
who
heard
the
remark
a
lot
cow
punchers
in
that
same
class
you
forget
it
frank
in
the
saddle
they
kin
ride
and
cavort
around
hours
hours
drop
on
their
feet
they
act
like
ducks
on
dry
land
a
cowboy
has
no
business
afoot
when
he
kin
git
a
pony
under
scotty
came
to
a
halt
a
little
further
on
he
seemed
to
be
interested
in
something
ahead
he
exclaimed
sure
is
a
mountain
charley
there
reckon
we
might
be
to
have
a
little
trouble
along
of
him
sooner
or
later
when
the
cattle
get
to
up
this
bob
instantly
understood
for
he
recognized
the
name
as
one
given
to
a
grizzly
bear
in
california
and
among
some
of
the
cowboys
of
the
southwest
is
he
he
asked
got
our
guns
and
perhaps
just
have
to
touch
up
the
old
fellow
because
it
would
never
do
to
let
him
get
among
the
said
the
ranchman
immediately
while
he
might
content
himself
with
just
a
single
cow
the
sight
and
smell
of
him
would
surely
stampede
the
rest
of
the
herd
and
let
that
once
happen
up
here
and
never
get
them
together
have
to
try
and
bowl
him
over
bob
said
frank
as
he
looked
to
his
repeating
rifle
which
was
one
of
the
very
best
on
the
market
bob
felt
the
sportsman
blood
leap
in
his
veins
this
was
different
from
shooting
an
innocent
little
antelope
which
he
never
did
without
feeling
more
or
less
sorry
and
only
repeated
the
exploit
because
fresh
food
was
needed
but
a
grizzly
bear
was
a
foe
worthy
of
the
efforts
of
the
most
experienced
hunter
bob
had
had
one
experience
in
this
line
and
not
a
great
distance
away
from
the
spot
where
he
now
stood
for
it
had
been
on
the
occasion
of
their
first
visit
to
thunder
mountain
that
it
happened
and
in
the
entrance
to
the
big
canyon
leading
upward
he
could
see
the
bear
now
that
scotty
had
pointed
him
out
the
animal
was
apparently
aware
of
the
presence
of
human
beings
but
he
showed
not
the
slightest
trace
of
fear
or
a
desire
to
retreat
seems
to
be
right
on
the
trail
declared
frank
as
he
looked
just
what
he
is
scotty
added
i
reckon
now
that
he
was
to
foller
the
tracks
of
old
baldy
if
there
was
the
least
whiff
of
scent
left
for
him
to
get
then
he
heard
us
and
squats
down
to
see
who
we
is
what
we
wants
in
his
they
continued
to
advance
colonel
haywood
bart
and
scotty
had
all
drawn
their
revolvers
and
were
ready
to
give
a
good
account
of
themselves
should
the
conflict
be
brought
to
close
quarters
all
of
them
knew
how
very
tough
a
grizzly
bear
is
and
that
often
many
bullets
will
fail
to
bring
such
a
terrible
brute
down
use
till
we
get
some
closer
boys
said
scotty
see
getting
up
now
exclaimed
bob
he
means
to
challenge
us
to
a
fight
or
not
liking
the
looks
of
our
crowd
expects
to
walk
off
to
his
den
which
must
be
up
here
knowed
one
to
back
out
of
a
scrap
avowed
scotty
coming
at
us
now
on
all
fours
and
looking
as
if
he
meant
to
take
us
on
in
a
bunch
you
think
we
ought
to
let
him
have
a
shot
frank
bob
asked
a
trifle
nervously
for
he
had
been
appalled
upon
examining
that
other
grizzly
to
note
the
terrible
claws
and
the
enormous
muscular
power
of
the
legs
yet
bob
frank
answered
coolly
your
horses
and
pretty
soon
have
our
chance
forget
to
try
and
get
him
back
of
the
shoulder
if
you
can
or
in
the
eye
either
the
brain
or
the
heart
is
the
place
to
hit
a
grizzly
you
can
pump
him
full
of
lead
in
other
places
and
walk
off
with
it
so
they
no
doubt
the
calm
manner
in
which
frank
handled
his
rifle
did
much
to
reassure
the
less
experienced
bob
he
immediately
a
brace
and
quieted
his
nerves
well
knowing
that
unless
he
secured
the
mastery
over
himself
he
could
hardly
do
good
work
when
the
moment
came
to
fire
as
both
parties
were
now
approaching
each
other
the
crisis
could
not
long
be
delayed
bob
thought
his
chum
might
be
going
a
little
too
far
still
he
remembered
that
at
the
famous
battle
of
bunker
hill
general
putnam
had
ordered
the
waiting
line
of
continentals
to
hold
their
fire
until
they
could
see
the
whites
of
the
eyes
so
it
was
apparently
good
policy
not
to
show
too
much
haste
when
expecting
an
attack
ready
bob
said
frank
presently
in
a
low
tone
the
grizzly
was
a
little
above
them
and
heading
straight
toward
the
place
where
the
five
intruders
into
his
domain
were
huddled
together
he
meant
to
attack
them
all
without
the
least
hesitation
this
scotty
afterwards
declared
was
something
unusual
for
a
grizzly
to
do
except
when
half
starved
he
might
not
make
a
move
to
run
away
but
he
does
not
often
attack
unless
wounded
and
enraged
frank
heading
so
straight
this
way
that
i
just
find
a
chance
to
aim
behind
his
shoulder
as
you
said
bob
complained
i
try
to
get
him
in
one
of
his
little
eyes
just
three
seconds
got
to
turn
around
that
rock
you
notice
as
he
comes
out
again
be
broadside
on
above
us
be
ready
to
give
him
your
first
shot
as
i
say
the
word
quick
now
look
sharp
even
while
frank
was
saying
this
the
bear
did
indeed
pass
back
of
the
spur
of
rock
just
as
the
boy
had
foreseen
bob
let
his
cheek
rest
against
the
stock
of
his
rifle
he
was
covering
the
exact
spot
where
he
expected
the
grizzly
to
show
up
in
another
second
as
his
nose
came
into
view
he
waddled
forward
as
bold
as
any
lion
ever
could
be
and
some
hunters
claim
a
great
deal
more
so
frank
uttered
this
one
word
it
was
immediately
drowned
in
a
double
crash
as
both
guns
were
discharged
with
the
sound
arose
a
series
of
cowboy
yells
from
bart
and
scotty
who
had
been
awaiting
the
result
of
the
volley
with
more
or
less
suppressed
excitement
bob
mechanically
went
through
the
pump
action
which
sent
the
discharged
shell
flying
out
to
one
side
and
pushed
a
fresh
cartridge
into
the
firing
chamber
at
the
same
time
leaving
the
gun
ready
for
business
with
the
hammer
raised
he
looked
upward
and
was
thrilled
to
see
the
great
hairy
figure
of
the
grizzly
apparently
rushing
straight
down
toward
them
naturally
the
first
and
dominating
thought
that
possessed
the
mind
of
the
kentucky
lad
was
that
after
all
their
lead
had
failed
to
reach
a
fatal
spot
and
that
the
bear
was
now
bent
on
seeking
revenge
for
the
pain
inflicted
on
him
those
yells
which
bob
had
at
first
believed
to
stand
for
exultation
might
after
all
mean
the
demoralization
of
the
cowboys
because
of
this
rush
of
the
great
beast
chapter
xvii
over
thunder
mountain
ridge
out
frank
coming
after
us
bob
was
trying
vainly
to
get
a
decent
aim
as
he
shouted
these
words
of
warning
he
had
spoken
them
in
a
mechanical
way
and
not
because
he
feared
that
his
chum
would
not
be
on
his
guard
already
were
bart
and
scotty
popping
away
with
their
guns
after
the
fashion
of
cowboys
quick
on
the
trigger
then
bob
suddenly
noticed
a
queer
thing
this
was
nothing
more
or
less
than
that
the
grizzly
while
still
coming
down
the
side
of
the
mountain
and
headed
directly
for
the
spot
where
they
stood
seemed
to
have
swerved
more
or
less
in
fact
he
was
coming
down
tail
foremost
it
was
this
singular
fact
that
gave
bob
his
first
suspicion
of
the
truth
then
quick
on
the
heels
of
this
he
discovered
that
frank
was
acting
in
a
most
peculiar
fashion
for
a
boy
who
ought
to
be
greatly
concerned
because
a
ferocious
beast
was
about
to
attack
them
frank
seemed
to
double
up
like
a
hinge
and
to
the
amazement
of
bob
he
saw
that
the
other
was
laughing
on
boys
frank
managed
to
call
out
waste
your
ammunition
because
you
may
need
it
that
bear
is
dead
of
course
upon
hearing
this
surprising
and
agreeable
news
both
bart
and
scotty
stopped
shooting
they
kill
him
or
was
it
our
first
bullets
that
did
the
trick
frank
bob
asked
as
the
body
of
the
monster
became
wedged
against
an
uplifted
spur
of
rock
not
ten
feet
away
take
the
credit
you
understand
announced
bart
positively
and
with
a
rather
foolish
grin
at
the
recent
panic
he
and
scotty
had
indulged
in
reckon
we
need
to
remarked
the
other
cowboy
energetically
here
count
much
agin
a
grizzly
when
ye
come
to
look
the
critter
over
i
allow
find
whar
ye
punctured
his
hide
right
back
the
foreleg
both
bullets
it
proved
to
be
a
fact
upon
examination
and
bob
felt
particularly
well
satisfied
to
know
that
in
such
an
emergency
he
had
managed
to
acquit
himself
so
well
such
results
seemed
to
show
that
his
nerve
was
all
right
we
let
the
old
fellow
lie
here
said
frank
bob
looked
surprised
at
this
what
harm
can
a
dead
bear
do
he
asked
should
think
that
all
the
fight
had
gone
out
of
him
by
it
has
answered
his
chum
never
get
that
skittish
herd
past
this
spot
let
me
tell
you
they
would
scent
that
bear
fifty
feet
away
dead
or
alive
it
make
much
difference
to
them
and
be
apt
to
have
a
stampede
on
our
hands
how
about
that
bart
dead
certainty
frank
replied
the
foreman
how
would
it
do
to
roll
him
over
that
precipice
there
suggested
bob
sorry
we
get
his
hide
but
it
will
have
to
go
this
the
idea
declared
frank
it
was
smart
of
you
to
think
of
it
all
come
and
take
hold
while
we
yank
him
around
take
the
united
strength
of
the
bunch
to
slew
him
out
of
that
crotch
said
bart
leading
the
way
to
the
slain
animal
at
any
rate
the
two
boys
were
allowed
to
see
just
where
their
lead
had
gone
been
better
shots
no
sir
not
if
it
was
the
oldest
hunter
of
the
rockies
declared
scotty
as
he
thrust
a
finger
in
the
holes
and
turned
a
look
of
genuine
admiration
on
both
frank
and
his
chum
bob
thought
that
praise
was
the
limit
the
memory
of
that
exciting
little
event
would
follow
him
always
in
imagination
he
would
many
times
see
that
grizzly
heading
down
the
slope
bent
on
questioning
their
right
to
progress
along
the
mountain
trail
and
the
quick
action
which
he
and
frank
had
been
compelled
to
take
in
order
to
meet
the
crisis
together
now
here
she
goes
boys
once
more
and
yet
another
for
good
luck
now
over
with
the
old
critter
and
as
scotty
spoke
he
led
the
last
effort
by
means
of
which
the
bulk
was
pushed
over
the
edge
of
the
little
precipice
there
was
a
heavy
thud
as
the
bear
brought
up
far
below
once
more
they
could
start
out
the
affair
with
the
bear
had
occupied
only
a
few
minutes
all
told
scotty
again
took
up
the
tracking
of
the
marked
hoof
belonging
to
old
baldy
the
trail
still
ran
upwards
toward
the
crest
of
the
ridge
and
there
no
longer
remained
a
single
doubt
in
the
minds
of
the
two
boys
but
that
the
clever
old
steer
had
made
his
final
escape
from
the
secret
valley
in
this
way
they
even
began
to
cast
their
eyes
aloft
in
the
hope
and
expectation
that
soon
they
might
figure
on
just
where
the
break
in
the
rocky
wall
was
to
be
found
with
a
passage
leading
over
to
the
other
side
of
the
ridge
think
i
see
where
bound
to
bring
up
frank
presently
remarked
show
me
please
said
bob
eagerly
for
his
eyes
being
unaccustomed
to
the
looks
of
wild
places
had
not
up
to
then
been
able
to
accomplish
much
to
me
there
is
some
sort
of
break
just
between
those
two
spurs
that
stand
up
yonder
like
sentries
frank
declared
correct
frank
cried
scotty
been
that
same
spot
myself
for
a
while
now
and
was
just
to
mention
it
whar
she
lies
colonel
believe
me
got
the
eyes
of
a
hawk
i
do
declare
much
escapes
him
get
up
there
in
a
few
minutes
we
demanded
bob
affirmed
bart
i
say
just
the
same
as
the
others
the
place
our
old
steer
quit
the
valley
when
he
yearned
to
git
back
home
and
broke
out
of
the
wire
corral
now
you
can
see
it
plain
indeed
as
they
progressed
further
it
became
a
positive
thing
even
bob
was
able
to
note
the
fact
that
there
was
some
sort
of
little
pass
between
those
two
rocky
horns
and
so
they
found
it
shortly
afterwards
when
they
entered
the
small
canyon
to
pass
quickly
through
and
see
how
the
trail
started
down
the
other
side
of
the
mountain
settles
it
cried
colonel
haywood
showing
that
the
strain
had
eased
up
considerably
in
his
mind
be
able
to
push
the
herd
over
here
trust
some
of
the
old
steers
for
knowing
that
baldy
went
ahead
of
them
and
hope
boys
of
our
being
down
there
on
the
plain
long
before
dark
sets
they
turned
back
at
once
and
made
all
possible
haste
to
arrive
at
the
spot
where
their
comrades
were
watching
the
cattle
seems
to
be
all
right
down
there
remarked
the
stockman
when
at
one
point
they
managed
to
obtain
a
glimpse
of
the
huddled
herd
with
the
cowboys
on
foot
circling
constantly
around
in
order
to
make
sure
that
no
start
was
made
toward
a
stampede
what
does
that
mean
cried
bob
as
shots
sounded
in
the
valley
down
by
the
camp
i
reckon
asserted
scotty
mendoza
is
to
break
out
and
the
boys
are
the
rustlers
after
the
few
shots
all
was
quiet
again
a
fact
that
seemed
to
satisfy
the
rancher
that
nothing
serious
had
come
of
the
effort
reckon
they
saw
some
sign
of
a
break
and
just
sent
in
a
few
shots
to
sort
of
remind
the
rustlers
that
they
were
still
thar
on
the
job
bart
suggested
but
not
being
able
to
learn
the
facts
they
had
to
let
that
theory
stand
arriving
at
the
place
where
the
big
herd
awaited
their
coming
they
were
soon
busily
employed
getting
the
stock
started
this
was
no
easy
task
there
on
the
mountainside
with
only
a
dim
trail
ahead
but
these
men
were
old
hands
at
the
business
they
knew
all
the
tricks
of
the
trade
and
how
to
utilize
the
instincts
of
the
cattle
in
carrying
out
their
designs
once
the
herd
started
upward
they
seemed
to
begin
to
understand
one
of
the
big
steers
led
the
way
doubtless
occupying
much
the
same
position
that
old
baldy
had
been
accustomed
to
filling
possibly
the
animal
could
catch
the
scent
of
the
preceding
beast
though
even
bob
considered
this
somewhat
unlikely
since
so
much
time
had
elapsed
since
baldy
passed
over
the
ground
but
in
climbing
upward
the
latter
had
always
unerringly
chosen
what
seemed
to
be
the
only
possible
route
so
once
the
herd
started
it
could
not
easily
go
wrong
colonel
haywood
had
sent
a
messenger
down
to
the
camp
with
new
word
for
those
two
daring
cowboys
who
were
shouldering
the
difficult
task
of
keeping
the
rustlers
penned
up
during
the
whole
day
they
were
to
wait
for
night
and
then
slip
secretly
away
their
horses
would
be
left
in
a
certain
place
for
them
and
they
were
ordered
to
follow
the
broad
trail
of
the
herd
until
they
overtook
the
main
body
of
drivers
up
the
mountain
the
drive
continued
constant
vigilance
was
required
in
order
to
keep
the
herd
intact
any
little
break
might
prove
a
serious
matter
with
that
precipitous
slope
below
them
down
which
a
frightened
animal
would
plunge
to
what
must
surely
prove
to
be
a
fatal
conclusion
been
through
some
drives
in
my
time
bart
remarked
after
they
had
pushed
along
in
this
way
for
nearly
two
hours
and
the
crest
of
the
ridge
was
close
at
hand
this
sure
takes
the
cake
if
we
get
this
herd
safe
down
to
level
land
again
be
mighty
glad
ye
bob
was
himself
well
pleased
when
the
last
of
the
steers
had
passed
through
the
little
canyon
and
started
down
the
outer
slope
the
going
here
was
better
somehow
as
they
all
realized
before
they
had
been
ten
minutes
following
the
stock
downward
undoubtedly
this
was
the
trail
old
baldy
must
have
struck
at
the
time
he
and
several
cows
were
missing
all
winter
following
some
instinct
he
had
thus
discovered
a
way
into
a
paradise
of
a
valley
where
the
forage
was
fine
through
all
the
winter
months
only
thing
that
surprises
me
remarked
frank
later
when
speaking
of
the
matter
that
baldy
never
tried
the
same
game
again
when
winter
came
along
but
perhaps
there
were
reasons
he
may
have
been
shut
in
a
corral
at
the
time
once
i
remember
he
was
suffering
from
a
sore
leg
on
account
of
tearing
through
a
barbed
wire
fence
but
things
are
looking
all
right
dad
i
should
be
better
son
replied
the
stockman
smilingly
all
we
need
now
to
make
us
happy
is
to
feel
our
ponies
under
at
those
words
every
cowboy
within
hearing
set
up
a
shout
the
very
mention
of
a
bronco
acted
on
them
as
might
a
tonic
this
business
of
climbing
mountains
on
foot
and
driving
a
herd
the
same
way
was
the
most
trying
experience
possible
it
would
haunt
them
for
many
a
long
day
and
a
mere
mention
of
the
trip
over
thunder
mountain
ridge
from
the
lost
valley
would
be
enough
to
make
them
content
with
their
lot
no
matter
what
troubles
they
happened
to
be
facing
at
the
time
foreseeing
that
they
would
be
slow
about
getting
to
the
foot
of
the
descent
the
stockman
had
sent
a
couple
of
men
ahead
to
scurry
around
to
where
they
had
left
all
their
mounts
if
these
could
be
waiting
for
them
when
they
struck
the
level
it
would
save
considerable
time
and
add
much
to
their
comfort
there
were
little
accidents
to
be
sure
on
the
way
down
but
all
things
considered
they
did
remarkably
well
but
it
was
certainly
a
bunch
of
cowboys
that
an
hour
or
so
before
dusk
gave
a
screech
as
they
found
themselves
on
the
level
once
more
with
no
more
climbing
or
descending
mountains
ahead
want
to
see
a
mountain
again
declared
scotty
as
he
limped
along
his
feet
sore
and
his
lower
limbs
feeling
as
though
they
had
been
scorched
look
there
that
jeff
coming
with
the
ponies
asked
frank
pointing
it
turned
out
to
be
so
and
from
that
moment
every
driver
quite
forgot
all
his
aches
in
the
wild
desire
to
once
more
mount
and
experience
the
delight
of
being
carried
swiftly
from
place
to
place
walking
to
a
cowboy
is
a
waste
of
time
and
energy
and
the
saddle
boys
were
also
glad
to
get
their
favorites
again
chapter
xviii
driving
the
herd
at
noon
the
drivers
had
eaten
whatever
they
chanced
to
have
along
with
them
if
one
happened
to
be
better
provided
than
his
mates
he
was
only
too
willing
to
share
his
lunch
it
was
anticipated
that
when
night
came
one
of
the
yearlings
in
the
herd
would
be
sacrificed
to
make
a
supper
for
the
outfit
and
on
the
strength
of
this
the
boys
had
been
enabled
to
put
in
the
entire
afternoon
once
they
a
leg
over
a
they
seemed
to
revive
wonderfully
after
that
the
tired
herd
would
have
to
hasten
to
keep
up
for
the
horses
were
fresh
but
colonel
haywood
knew
they
could
not
expect
to
make
any
great
distance
before
camping
he
saw
that
some
of
the
cattle
were
footsore
and
liable
to
drop
if
pushed
too
far
only
one
thing
got
to
look
out
for
remarked
bart
as
they
considered
the
advisability
of
stopping
for
the
night
that
asked
bob
who
chanced
to
be
alongside
the
foreman
at
the
time
have
any
way
of
knowing
what
them
rustlers
might
feel
like
doing
once
they
git
out
of
that
bart
continued
you
mean
they
may
take
a
notion
to
follow
us
and
fight
for
the
possession
of
the
herd
asked
the
boy
thrilled
by
the
possibility
of
further
adventure
on
this
trip
as
a
rule
the
fellers
that
foller
that
line
of
business
are
a
lot
of
cowardly
coyotes
and
on
found
out
will
run
to
beat
the
band
bart
went
on
this
here
mendoza
hard
to
place
course
just
over
mad
because
his
fine
hiding
place
is
discovered
and
never
be
able
to
use
the
same
again
question
is
will
he
make
a
break
for
the
border
thinking
the
ranchers
are
hot
on
his
trail
or
foller
after
us
just
for
spite
to
stampede
the
herd
and
make
trouble
have
to
keep
a
pretty
good
watch
i
should
think
bob
observed
goes
without
younker
replied
the
boss
puncher
as
some
of
the
stock
just
look
all
in
have
to
call
a
halt
here
and
now
as
good
a
place
as
we
can
find
i
what
i
was
going
to
say
bart
laughed
frank
coming
up
at
that
moment
the
grass
is
good
considering
the
season
and
all
the
water
wanted
fresh
from
the
when
the
shouts
of
the
cowboys
told
the
weary
cattle
that
they
were
to
stop
and
rest
they
gave
evidence
of
their
satisfaction
crowding
along
the
little
stream
they
drank
their
fill
after
the
heat
of
the
day
some
began
to
crop
the
forage
with
others
immediately
dropped
down
utterly
exhausted
by
their
labors
with
the
report
of
a
gun
one
of
the
yearlings
dropped
and
a
cowboy
was
soon
busily
engaged
in
cutting
the
animal
up
to
serve
as
their
supper
a
fire
was
started
though
fuel
seemed
scarce
but
then
only
a
cooking
blaze
was
required
and
after
supper
was
served
they
would
have
no
further
need
for
any
fire
bob
admitted
frankly
that
he
felt
tired
out
though
he
did
not
fully
realize
just
how
weary
he
was
until
he
had
sat
down
a
little
while
and
then
attempted
to
rise
suddenly
i
just
do
it
frank
he
exclaimed
with
a
long
face
as
if
my
legs
needed
oiling
about
the
hinges
that
rusty
gee
i
hope
be
feeling
better
than
this
in
the
worry
about
that
laughed
his
chum
who
of
course
being
somewhat
tougher
had
not
suffered
quite
as
much
as
bob
a
sleep
be
as
fresh
as
a
daisy
i
want
to
stand
my
watch
all
the
same
ventured
bob
positively
frank
looked
at
him
come
over
you
to
say
that
he
demanded
when
danger
around
i
think
every
fellow
ought
to
share
the
duties
of
standing
guard
bob
replied
sturdily
at
that
frank
whistled
and
then
chuckled
see
been
talking
with
bart
and
given
you
the
idea
the
rustlers
may
be
silly
enough
to
follow
after
us
just
to
get
revenge
he
remarked
bart
did
say
something
like
that
bob
admitted
he
also
told
me
he
meant
to
keep
a
close
watch
all
night
to
prevent
a
surprise
and
a
rats
you
believe
anything
like
that
going
to
happen
frank
hastened
to
remark
seeing
that
his
chum
was
really
concerned
and
worried
over
the
grim
predictions
of
the
boss
cowboy
you
take
any
stock
in
it
yourself
frank
i
replied
the
other
quickly
adding
of
course
bart
is
quite
right
in
saying
he
mean
to
take
any
chances
of
a
stampede
in
the
night
done
so
well
that
it
would
be
a
shame
to
have
any
accident
happen
how
about
the
rustlers
asked
the
other
by
this
time
out
of
that
perhaps
or
will
be
as
soon
as
really
dark
my
opinion
is
if
you
want
to
hear
it
bob
that
get
out
of
that
valley
on
foot
as
fast
as
they
can
leaving
their
ponies
behind
them
because
they
know
about
this
other
gateway
you
then
continued
bob
be
in
a
panic
believing
that
since
known
now
the
soon
be
too
hot
to
hold
and
so
be
a
chase
for
the
mexican
border
and
a
riddance
to
bad
for
arizona
frank
concluded
after
that
little
talk
fears
subsided
somewhat
though
he
did
occasionally
cast
a
furtive
glance
backward
to
where
the
high
rocky
ridge
cut
across
the
as
though
wondering
what
was
taking
place
beyond
the
barrier
supper
was
soon
ready
and
it
was
an
almost
famished
bunch
of
cow
punchers
who
gathered
around
taking
turns
at
eating
for
bart
would
not
let
the
herd
go
unguarded
even
for
a
minute
arrangements
were
soon
made
looking
to
a
detail
of
wranglers
to
stand
watch
over
the
saddle
horses
and
the
cattle
bob
was
not
allowed
any
share
in
this
duty
much
to
his
regret
for
he
was
in
earnest
in
his
wish
to
have
a
part
in
the
labor
his
inexperience
would
have
rendered
his
work
of
little
value
and
the
head
herder
decided
that
he
might
just
as
well
get
his
full
rest
bob
lay
down
the
best
he
could
he
needed
no
lullaby
to
put
him
to
sleep
that
night
the
last
things
he
remembered
hearing
were
the
whispers
of
the
boys
who
sat
near
by
the
drone
of
insects
in
the
grass
the
uneasy
movements
of
the
herd
not
far
away
and
some
night
bird
calling
in
the
trees
close
by
the
foot
of
the
mountains
when
he
awoke
he
could
hardly
believe
his
senses
as
he
sat
up
and
dug
his
knuckles
in
his
eyes
it
was
getting
broad
daylight
the
cattle
seemed
to
be
for
the
most
part
feeding
on
the
sweet
grass
that
grew
close
to
the
creek
and
were
apparently
in
good
trim
for
the
long
drive
to
the
ranch
that
was
a
time
when
i
slept
like
a
top
sure
pop
said
bob
as
he
started
to
get
to
his
feet
as
if
just
lain
down
and
yet
here
it
is
dawn
and
nothing
happened
after
all
there
was
a
shade
of
disappointment
in
tone
whether
this
came
from
the
fact
that
he
had
not
been
allowed
to
share
in
guarding
the
camp
because
of
his
being
reckoned
a
greenhorn
or
on
account
of
the
failure
of
prediction
of
further
trouble
it
would
be
hard
to
say
enough
of
the
beef
remained
to
serve
for
breakfast
and
they
hoped
to
be
at
the
ranch
before
they
were
hungry
again
see
we
have
any
trouble
after
all
bob
said
frank
as
he
joined
his
chum
who
was
looking
after
his
horse
at
the
time
we
did
i
must
have
slept
right
through
it
all
chuckled
bob
knew
a
thing
from
the
time
i
shut
my
eyes
till
daylight
wakened
me
but
i
reckon
nothing
bothered
the
herd
and
starting
the
day
believe
even
a
stray
wolf
or
coyote
came
near
the
whole
night
frank
went
on
was
up
myself
for
two
hours
keeping
watch
over
the
cattle
and
once
i
thought
i
heard
the
report
of
firearms
but
it
repeated
and
right
now
i
say
what
it
was
i
caught
might
have
been
just
one
of
those
little
rock
slides
up
on
the
glad
all
over
said
bob
here
frank
added
sure
been
some
strenuous
and
that
climb
over
the
ridge
was
the
toughest
ever
i
suppose
believe
now
what
i
told
you
about
how
cattle
can
get
up
and
go
some
just
great
at
climbing
what
the
other
admitted
after
breakfast
the
start
was
made
there
was
little
trouble
with
the
herd
now
reaching
level
land
had
apparently
brought
about
a
return
of
their
confidence
and
it
might
even
be
that
some
of
the
older
steers
could
scent
their
customary
feeding
grounds
in
the
distance
at
any
rate
they
started
off
and
being
once
more
in
their
glory
while
mounted
on
their
ponies
the
cowboys
proved
as
active
as
cats
darting
here
and
there
to
keep
their
charges
in
a
compact
mass
as
they
headed
toward
distant
circle
ranch
it
was
about
two
hours
later
that
bob
rode
alongside
his
chum
do
you
suppose
that
means
any
trouble
for
us
frank
he
demanded
and
as
the
other
turned
his
head
to
see
what
the
kentucky
boy
might
be
pointing
at
he
discovered
two
horsemen
heading
after
them
visions
of
a
desperate
and
vengeful
mendoza
had
naturally
leaped
into
mind
at
first
seeing
these
parties
frank
quickly
put
him
at
his
ease
by
a
jugfull
bob
he
said
cheerfully
fellows
are
the
two
men
we
left
behind
us
in
the
valley
to
guard
the
rustlers
and
keep
them
quiet
they
got
out
all
right
it
seems
and
found
their
ponies
where
they
were
be
able
to
tell
us
something
about
the
rustlers
and
what
they
were
doing
the
last
they
saw
of
the
crowd
bob
suggested
as
like
as
not
they
may
his
chum
admitted
and
then
they
waited
for
the
two
riders
to
overtake
the
herd
drivers
of
course
there
was
considerable
yelling
and
waving
of
hats
to
mark
the
arrival
of
the
balance
of
the
circle
ranch
outfit
but
knowing
that
they
should
make
their
report
to
their
employer
first
the
two
riders
sought
the
spot
where
he
and
the
foreman
were
to
be
found
of
course
the
two
saddle
boys
hovered
around
wishing
to
learn
any
news
in
connection
with
what
had
occurred
in
the
valley
during
the
preceding
day
while
the
great
herd
was
being
driven
over
the
ridge
under
the
skillful
questioning
of
the
stockman
the
cowboys
told
their
story
all
through
the
long
day
they
had
kept
watch
and
ward
over
the
several
times
the
rustlers
who
were
being
held
prisoners
there
made
a
show
of
rushing
out
but
they
really
lacked
the
nerve
to
take
their
lives
in
their
hands
and
so
evening
still
found
the
situation
unchanged
when
it
was
dark
the
two
cowboys
had
fired
a
few
shots
to
let
the
rustlers
understand
they
were
still
on
deck
then
they
had
decamped
and
finding
the
exit
managed
after
great
difficulties
to
climb
out
over
the
masses
of
rock
which
had
been
torn
loose
by
the
explosion
of
dynamite
they
had
spent
the
balance
of
the
night
in
hiding
and
when
morning
came
made
a
for
the
place
where
they
had
been
informed
their
horses
would
be
waiting
after
that
it
was
no
great
effort
to
discover
the
presence
of
the
herd
off
on
the
plain
and
make
direct
for
the
cattle
you
saw
nothing
of
the
rustlers
after
you
left
asked
the
stockman
think
we
saw
a
bunch
of
riders
far
away
to
the
south
an
hour
back
one
of
the
cowboys
answered
hitting
it
up
for
all
they
were
worth
if
so
be
the
rustlers
had
a
saddle
band
outside
the
valley
somewhere
then
that
must
been
the
crowd
we
saw
no
danger
of
them
back
on
the
whole
just
as
well
remarked
colonel
haywood
there
are
those
who
have
suffered
at
the
hands
of
mendoza
in
the
past
who
would
much
rather
see
him
a
prisoner
and
sent
to
the
penitentiary
for
a
long
reckon
never
get
thar
remarked
bart
with
a
smile
and
a
nod
that
bob
though
a
greenhorn
could
easily
interpret
to
mean
that
the
cow
men
knew
of
a
better
way
to
settle
the
rustler
so
he
could
never
again
raid
their
herds
chapter
xix
startling
news
promises
to
be
a
bully
day
for
the
frank
remarked
bob
just
hours
after
the
morning
that
saw
them
near
the
foot
of
the
thunder
mountain
ridge
and
driving
the
recovered
herd
homeward
after
rescuing
it
from
the
cattle
rustlers
of
the
dreaded
mendoza
what
it
does
replied
his
chum
who
was
sitting
on
his
buckskin
pony
and
looking
out
to
where
a
band
of
punchers
were
circling
around
the
first
bunch
of
cattle
that
would
require
attention
colonel
haywood
had
been
hearing
from
the
neighboring
ranches
ever
since
they
reached
home
in
a
side
corral
he
had
all
the
cattle
taken
from
the
rustlers
outside
of
those
which
he
recognized
as
his
own
property
here
the
other
stockmen
tried
to
pick
out
certain
steers
and
cows
which
had
been
stolen
from
them
recently
the
original
brands
had
been
destroyed
and
a
new
one
burned
on
the
flanks
of
the
animals
evidently
these
steers
had
been
intended
for
shipping
at
the
first
favorable
opportunity
for
reaching
the
railroad
on
the
part
of
the
rustlers
by
degrees
of
the
recovered
stock
had
been
claimed
the
balance
was
likely
to
remain
in
the
hands
of
the
circle
ranch
people
since
there
was
no
means
of
identifying
it
having
made
all
his
arrangements
for
the
fall
colonel
haywood
did
not
allow
such
a
little
matter
as
his
encounter
with
the
rustler
band
to
disturb
his
well
laid
plans
so
this
fine
morning
every
cowboy
employed
on
the
ranch
as
well
as
some
borrowed
from
friendly
neighbors
such
as
the
arrowhead
over
on
the
creek
were
hard
at
work
bringing
in
cattle
to
be
looked
over
the
brands
renewed
in
cases
where
they
had
become
unsightly
and
the
youngsters
that
had
grown
to
a
considerable
size
taken
in
hand
for
the
first
time
and
marked
with
the
big
circle
since
a
full
day
had
elapsed
after
their
arrival
in
safety
at
the
ranch
the
two
saddle
boys
had
fully
recovered
from
their
fatigue
a
couple
of
good
sleep
had
also
done
much
toward
making
them
feel
as
as
ever
as
bob
expressed
it
they
get
it
all
through
with
in
one
day
asked
the
kentucky
boy
laughing
at
the
antics
of
some
of
the
wild
riders
who
were
rushing
back
and
forth
on
all
sides
of
the
herd
and
showing
their
wonderful
skill
in
the
saddle
there
were
riders
in
the
circle
outfit
who
had
few
equals
when
it
came
to
carrying
out
the
many
difficult
feats
whereby
cowboys
delight
to
prove
their
claim
to
being
better
riders
than
even
the
famous
russian
cossacks
they
could
do
the
most
astonishing
tricks
while
galloping
at
full
speed
over
the
plain
and
bob
though
brought
up
in
an
atmosphere
where
fine
horses
were
bred
the
blue
grass
region
of
kentucky
despaired
of
ever
equalling
the
records
of
some
of
these
expert
and
reckless
punchers
says
it
will
take
all
of
two
and
maybe
more
replied
frank
see
some
of
the
herds
are
a
long
ways
off
and
then
never
imagine
the
trouble
an
old
steer
gives
once
in
a
while
when
necessary
to
renew
his
brand
seen
half
a
dozen
boys
at
their
ends
to
down
a
tough
old
chap
though
they
always
get
him
sooner
or
later
but
it
takes
baldy
is
with
that
lot
frank
sure
i
can
tell
him
from
here
leading
them
all
like
a
proud
baldy
sure
and
no
need
of
him
worrying
about
his
feed
after
this
every
cowboy
on
the
range
is
proud
of
the
way
that
old
rascal
found
his
way
out
of
the
lost
valley
why
just
think
how
much
we
owe
him
only
for
his
leaving
a
marked
trail
up
to
the
second
gateway
still
have
part
of
our
herd
cooped
up
there
and
a
big
job
to
dig
a
passage
through
those
rocks
to
get
frank
what
do
you
think
i
dreamed
last
night
that
i
found
it
suppose
now
talking
of
that
wonderful
hunting
knife
you
lost
nearly
a
week
back
remarked
the
other
smiling
that
bob
went
on
where
was
it
in
your
dream
continued
frank
do
you
suppose
frank
if
going
to
get
me
guessing
the
first
place
think
about
would
be
the
spot
where
you
cut
up
that
deer
under
the
twin
how
is
that
for
a
starter
bob
made
a
of
it
that
time
because
just
where
i
thought
i
found
the
old
blade
bob
exclaimed
lying
on
the
ground
and
perhaps
half
hidden
under
the
grass
or
trash
eh
his
chum
continued
where
you
missed
fire
where
else
but
sticking
in
the
trunk
of
that
tree
just
where
the
first
crotch
lies
but
frank
try
as
i
will
i
just
remember
ever
putting
it
prove
anything
his
chum
went
on
to
say
with
decision
you
know
we
do
things
mechanically
and
without
just
as
a
fellow
will
work
his
after
firing
a
round
it
may
be
so
frank
and
if
it
that
i
want
to
see
everything
that
goes
on
at
the
grand
here
ask
you
to
ride
with
me
over
the
plain
to
where
we
got
that
i
would
have
to
decline
all
the
same
bob
because
wanted
here
and
so
are
you
another
time
will
have
to
do
if
true
that
the
knife
is
there
i
reckon
it
run
away
inside
of
another
couple
of
days
or
not
replied
bob
a
little
dejectedly
it
is
true
for
the
longer
the
missing
article
eluded
his
search
the
greater
grew
his
desire
to
find
it
again
they
were
soon
in
the
thick
of
the
work
frank
was
given
opportunities
to
show
how
he
could
throw
the
rope
and
bring
a
steer
down
bob
too
took
a
chance
and
as
he
had
been
practicing
diligently
since
his
last
public
attempt
he
himself
proud
as
he
expressed
it
actually
roping
a
big
steer
and
throwing
the
beast
in
a
way
that
brought
out
a
round
of
cheers
from
frank
and
the
boys
then
bob
also
assisted
with
the
branding
the
afternoon
found
them
still
at
it
with
hundreds
of
cattle
to
be
looked
over
considerable
time
was
required
to
accomplish
a
clean
sweep
colonel
haywood
found
much
cause
for
satisfaction
his
herds
had
increased
even
more
than
his
best
record
and
doubtless
the
next
few
shipments
would
be
banner
ones
for
circle
ranch
then
again
the
fact
that
he
had
not
only
recovered
his
missing
herd
but
driven
the
rustlers
out
of
their
long
secret
lair
was
another
cause
for
congratulation
on
the
preceding
day
a
couple
of
cowboys
had
been
sent
back
over
the
trail
with
instructions
to
leave
their
horses
at
the
foot
of
the
mountain
ridge
and
on
foot
follow
the
tracks
left
by
the
escaping
herd
passing
into
the
valley
by
way
of
the
new
gateway
they
were
to
look
there
for
the
horses
of
the
rustlers
which
it
was
believed
must
have
been
abandoned
at
the
time
of
their
flight
and
should
these
be
found
they
would
become
the
property
of
circle
ranch
as
spoils
of
war
the
afternoon
was
fairly
well
along
when
the
two
saddle
boys
being
tired
of
the
sights
and
sounds
marking
the
grand
decided
to
gallop
a
few
miles
away
over
the
plain
a
lone
pilgrim
heading
this
way
frank
and
on
foot
too
which
i
take
it
is
some
queer
out
in
this
country
bob
remarked
pointing
as
he
spoke
i
know
his
comrade
said
sometimes
indians
all
happen
to
be
riders
like
the
apaches
and
comanches
you
that
an
indian
then
asked
bob
sure
is
or
my
eyes
deceive
me
frank
went
on
more
perhaps
we
happen
to
know
him
you
mean
havasupai
the
old
moqui
frank
man
walks
like
him
the
prairie
boy
continued
see
making
gestures
to
us
right
now
i
guess
recognized
us
all
right
trust
an
eyes
for
knowing
a
friend
as
far
as
he
can
see
the
last
we
saw
of
havasupai
was
up
there
in
the
valley
when
he
shut
the
door
of
the
just
when
he
knew
every
of
was
asleep
to
tell
the
honest
truth
i
had
clean
forgot
all
about
the
old
fellow
after
i
forget
him
frank
remarked
he
never
showed
up
again
and
i
had
to
come
away
without
seeing
him
i
reckoned
he
want
mendoza
to
know
he
had
played
him
false
you
see
the
old
moqui
was
awfully
anxious
to
learn
where
his
daughter
the
antelope
was
it
seems
that
the
rustler
married
the
moqui
girl
and
has
her
hidden
away
i
heard
him
say
she
was
down
in
mexico
bob
declared
struck
me
that
havasupai
must
imagine
the
girl
is
being
badly
treated
and
he
wants
to
recover
her
again
do
you
think
near
the
truth
there
frank
certainly
do
answered
the
other
as
he
swung
around
and
started
his
horse
on
an
easy
lope
toward
the
on
coming
figure
already
bob
saw
that
it
was
certainly
the
old
moqui
they
had
met
havasupai
first
of
all
up
in
the
region
of
the
grand
canyon
of
the
colorado
as
has
been
mentioned
in
an
earlier
volume
of
this
series
and
his
actions
in
the
lost
valley
had
proven
beyond
all
question
that
the
moqui
wished
to
retain
their
friendship
will
be
glad
to
see
him
frank
remarked
as
they
drew
rapidly
nearer
the
figure
of
the
weary
walker
said
he
meant
to
help
the
old
man
recover
his
child
if
it
was
possible
and
i
heard
him
even
asking
several
of
those
other
stockmen
if
they
knew
anything
about
i
hope
he
came
across
a
clue
then
bob
remarked
it
must
be
hard
on
the
old
chap
being
exiled
from
his
village
and
losing
his
only
says
that
the
old
warrior
can
stay
around
circle
ranch
as
long
as
he
wants
frank
went
on
to
say
will
always
have
his
three
meals
a
day
and
little
to
do
perhaps
on
his
way
there
right
now
he
might
happen
to
know
something
of
what
his
is
meaning
to
presently
they
drew
up
with
a
flourish
alongside
the
old
moqui
who
allowed
a
faint
smile
of
welcome
to
creep
over
his
wrinkled
and
bronzed
face
at
sight
of
the
two
lads
he
had
come
to
care
for
more
than
a
little
havasupai
what
cheer
cried
bob
reaching
down
to
shake
hands
hope
on
your
way
to
the
ranch
chief
frank
said
a
little
more
seriously
my
father
the
colonel
wants
to
see
you
and
tell
you
something
about
the
one
you
are
hunting
will
you
take
a
seat
here
behind
me
and
ride
will
be
as
well
if
havasupai
can
meet
the
big
chief
soon
replied
the
old
moqui
gravely
as
he
accepted
hand
and
for
a
man
of
his
years
deftly
climbed
to
the
withers
of
the
buckskin
pony
that
pranced
about
as
though
not
satisfied
at
the
prospect
of
carrying
double
you
any
news
to
take
of
the
white
wolf
asked
frank
referring
to
the
rustler
leader
after
the
fashion
in
which
the
moqui
himself
had
addressed
him
has
left
the
band
and
turned
back
filled
with
hatred
for
those
who
took
his
cattle
out
of
the
valley
even
now
he
may
be
there
at
the
ranch
with
a
double
face
meaning
to
have
revenge
by
burning
the
teepee
of
the
white
man
or
poisoning
the
spring
where
the
frank
and
bob
stared
at
each
other
when
the
old
moqui
said
this
must
make
for
home
on
the
jump
bob
exclaimed
the
son
as
he
dug
his
heels
into
the
sides
of
his
pony
and
headed
along
the
back
trail
followed
by
his
alarmed
chum

when

heard
these
words
spoken
in
his
ear
by
the
old
moqui
he
threw
up
his
right
hand
to
let
bob
know
he
intended
coming
to
a
halt
so
that
the
galloping
horses
might
not
collide
they
had
gone
several
miles
in
the
direction
of
the
ranch
house
which
could
even
then
be
seen
in
the
far
distance
with
moving
horsemen
darting
this
way
and
that
as
the
process
of
the
rounding
up
and
branding
the
cattle
went
on
apace

to
say
something
bob
and
asked
me
to
stop
was
the
way
the
prairie
boy
accounted
for
his
sudden
change
of
mind
the
moqui
slipped
from
the
back
of
buckskin
to
the
ground
he
was
evidently
considerably
tired
from
his
long
journey
but
an
indian
would
scorn
to
admit
such
a
thing
even
though
near
the
point
of
utter
exhaustion
so
the
moqui
looked
as
full
of
grit
and
determination
as
though
he
had
only
started
out
when
they
came
upon
him
on
the
plain
may
be
he
commenced
to
say
in
his
solemn
way
white
wolf
already
there
to
play
part
of
mexican
we
think
of
that
did
we
frank
ejaculated
bob
tell
the
truth
we
started
off
at
such
a
wild
pace
that
there
time
to
think
much
of
anything
admitted
his
chum
do
you
believe
it
could
be
done
persisted
bob
must
be
cowboys
working
on
the
circle
ranch
range
who
knew
this
mendoza
in
the
past
and
they
be
apt
to
recognize
the
rustler
if
so
be
he
dared
come
and
engage
to
work
alongside
them
know
frank
replied
thoughtfully
mexican
can
change
his
looks
easy
enough
you
understand
we
saw
mendoza
in
the
lost
valley
and
as
i
remember
him
he
had
a
mustache
and
little
sideburns
in
front
of
his
ears
the
way
so
many
mexican
senors
do
suppose
he
took
a
notion
to
have
a
clean
face
why
his
best
friend
might
pass
him
by
reckon
right
frank
replied
the
other
shaking
his
head
as
though
he
did
not
exactly
like
the
situation
now
that
speaking
of
it
i
just
remember
that
among
the
extra
punchers
your
father
took
on
to
hurry
this
through
there
are
a
number
of
mexicans
who
are
among
the
best
riders
on
the
right
bob
then
a
chance
that
one
of
them
may
be
mendoza
himself
if
what
our
friend
here
tells
us
turns
out
to
be
true
and
not
a
false
would
mendoza
dare
risk
his
life
in
that
way
by
coming
back
to
the
country
where
every
hand
is
raised
against
him
bob
asked
wonderingly
say
he
is
a
man
of
fierce
temper
and
strong
hates
frank
continued
heard
lots
of
stories
about
his
daring
some
people
choose
to
call
him
a
coward
but
bad
man
as
he
is
i
believe
that
name
fits
him
and
in
all
his
career
as
a
cattle
rustler
i
think
he
ever
had
such
a
hard
knock
as
when
we
snatched
all
his
cattle
away
from
him
and
our
boys
held
him
up
a
whole
day
in
that
bob
admitted
sounds
all
right
i
can
understand
how
angry
it
must
make
a
man
like
that
to
remember
his
profitable
business
of
helping
himself
to
other
horses
and
cattle
has
been
frosted
and
ruined
forever
in
you
see
he
must
know
that
circle
ranch
was
responsible
for
it
all
frank
continued
that
means
he
hates
everything
connected
with
our
place
you
and
me
included
in
the
lot
on
the
way
to
the
border
where
his
men
intended
crossing
so
as
to
be
safe
from
the
pursuit
they
expected
mendoza
has
been
brooding
over
the
fall
of
his
plans
and
it
just
set
him
that
sounds
as
if
you
could
look
in
on
his
camp
and
see
the
rustler
walking
up
and
down
saying
all
sorts
of
things
to
himself
and
vowing
to
be
revenged
on
circle
ranch
for
his
downfall
frank
i
hate
to
admit
it
but
afraid
havasupai
may
be
right
and
that
the
white
wolf
is
already
galloping
over
our
range
roping
cattle
and
mixing
with
our
boys
like
one
of
used
to
say
he
was
a
cowboy
once
himself
years
ago
and
knows
all
the
wrinkles
of
the
business
frank
went
on
gives
me
a
shiver
just
to
think
of
that
bad
man
being
among
our
fellows
why
even
before
now
perhaps
found
some
excuse
to
get
inside
the
ranch
buildings
to
look
around
and
plan
his
game
of
setting
fire
to
them
could
he
do
that
asked
bob
excitedly
all
the
boys
are
expected
to
be
busy
with
the
roping
and
branding
it
look
mighty
suspicious
for
a
mexican
to
be
prowling
around
the
ranch
house
where
only
the
women
folks
and
ah
sin
are
left
matter
what
it
would
look
like
a
cunning
schemer
like
mendoza
could
find
a
way
to
get
there
frank
insisted
now
in
his
work
he
complained
of
having
wrenched
his
arm
or
shoulder
and
asked
to
have
some
liniment
applied
i
just
know
that
my
dad
would
tell
him
to
gallop
back
to
the
house
and
get
miss
prue
who
always
looks
after
the
little
hurts
of
the
men
to
rub
on
some
of
the
famous
stuff
she
keeps
for
just
that
purpose
bob
gave
a
low
whistle
to
indicate
how
he
was
affected
by
what
his
chum
said
sure
takes
you
to
see
through
all
these
things
frank
he
declared
yet
supposed
to
be
going
to
make
a
lawyer
some
fine
day
but
they
seem
to
dawn
on
my
mind
till
after
given
me
a
because
been
brought
up
here
said
frank
know
cowboys
and
their
ways
just
through
and
through
and
if
mendoza
wanted
to
see
what
the
inside
of
the
ranch
house
looked
like
and
meet
the
women
folks
face
to
face
be
just
as
apt
as
anything
to
try
some
way
like
that
it
would
be
easy
for
such
a
bold
man
what
do
you
suppose
the
old
warrior
wants
you
to
hold
up
here
for
asked
the
kentucky
boy
who
could
ask
questions
as
became
a
lawyer
even
if
he
failed
to
grasp
situations
as
readily
as
his
chum
about
that
havasupai
asked
frank
as
he
turned
to
the
moqui
who
had
been
listening
to
what
they
said
with
deep
earnestness
rustlers
get
out
of
valley
and
pick
up
other
ponies
havasupai
ride
with
same
he
said
slowly
want
see
antelope
and
think
white
wolf
lead
way
to
where
the
daughter
of
the
moqui
be
hidden
away
then
watch
while
white
wolf
walk
up
walk
down
say
heap
to
self
shake
fist
back
at
thunder
mountain
then
when
all
rest
sleep
jump
on
pony
and
ride
away
to
north
know
then
what
in
mind
of
bad
man
so
havasupai
too
leave
camp
and
start
walk
many
miles
to
tell
frank
bob
look
out
before
blow
it
evidently
the
old
moqui
believed
in
condensing
things
and
not
wasting
a
single
word
more
than
was
absolutely
necessary
still
while
his
story
left
much
to
the
imagination
even
bob
could
read
between
the
lines
to
me
that
he
may
be
right
frank
he
declared
as
the
indian
relapsed
into
silence
once
more
having
finished
his
say
mendoza
is
really
and
truly
playing
the
part
of
a
cowboy
in
the
circle
ranch
grand
and
saw
us
fetching
havasupai
in
on
our
ponies
of
course
know
that
his
little
game
was
in
the
soup
that
would
make
him
furious
it
now
and
he
might
be
tempted
to
do
something
desperate
knowing
that
be
chased
by
the
whole
pack
of
cowboys
then
and
there
so
you
see
bob
our
policy
just
as
the
moqui
hints
to
keep
from
telling
mendoza
that
we
suspect
his
presence
that
gives
us
a
chance
to
tell
dad
and
make
up
some
sort
of
plan
to
capture
the
rustler
before
he
can
get
in
his
bad
right
frank
observed
bob
i
see
it
all
now
thanks
to
the
moqui
first
of
all
if
it
been
for
him
i
reckon
have
brushed
right
along
into
camp
and
the
fat
would
have
been
in
the
fire
right
away
now
ride
back
just
as
if
only
had
our
gallop
and
havasupai
can
come
in
after
dark
is
that
the
idea
got
it
down
pat
there
bob
returned
the
other
as
the
afternoon
is
going
fast
now
perhaps
better
be
on
our
way
back
i
feel
a
creepy
sensation
all
over
me
every
time
i
think
of
what
that
rascal
might
do
to
get
even
with
circle
ranch
for
his
you
hear
what
havasupai
said
about
his
poisoning
the
spring
where
our
cattle
drink
demanded
bob
perhaps
he
might
be
ready
to
do
such
a
thing
and
again
not
frank
answered
slowly
hate
to
think
any
man
would
be
so
mean
as
that
but
no
matter
his
being
at
circle
ranch
looks
like
he
had
some
scheme
in
his
mind
for
getting
even
and
just
got
to
nip
it
in
the
bud
then
chief
see
you
later
you
come
to
ranch
house
my
father
he
wants
to
hold
out
a
helping
hand
to
you
he
believes
he
knows
where
antelope
is
cowboy
tell
him
how
almost
unconsciously
when
frank
talked
with
an
indian
he
adopted
some
of
the
methods
of
expression
in
vogue
among
the
red
men
perhaps
like
others
born
and
brought
up
in
close
association
with
these
people
he
believed
that
he
could
make
himself
better
understood
this
way
havasupai
nodded
his
head
and
straightened
up
as
if
ready
to
continue
his
wearisome
tramp
fatigue
and
he
were
no
strangers
and
nothing
of
this
sort
could
in
any
way
daunt
the
spirit
of
the
outcast
is
well
frank
he
said
in
his
deep
way
of
speaking
dark
come
havasupai
will
be
close
to
ranch
house
and
on
watch
no
burn
same
if
can
be
stopped
much
good
about
antelope
know
now
the
white
wolf
bad
man
never
believe
havasupai
be
glad
leave
him
all
time
the
old
moqui
had
at
least
caught
the
parting
sign
of
the
range
for
as
he
finished
speaking
he
waved
his
hand
to
the
two
boys
as
they
let
their
horses
have
their
heads
and
galloped
away
toward
home
looking
back
once
after
they
had
gone
some
little
distance
bob
saw
the
exiled
moqui
walking
leisurely
along
he
knew
from
this
that
havasupai
did
not
wish
to
get
within
a
certain
distance
of
the
ranch
buildings
before
night
fell
for
fear
that
the
cunning
eyes
of
the
mexican
rustler
might
discover
him
are
we
going
to
do
about
it
frank
demanded
the
kentucky
boy
as
usual
depending
on
his
chum
to
take
the
lead
of
all
let
dad
know
replied
frank
promptly
perhaps
start
out
to
take
a
closer
look
at
every
mexican
puncher
on
the
place
suggested
bob
there
just
be
some
when
he
finds
mendoza
and
accuses
him
of
wanting
to
burn
the
buildings
or
something
about
as
bad
whew
the
mexican
will
be
some
surprised
when
he
learns
his
mask
is
snatched
off
eh
frank
the
same
i
believe
dad
will
do
anything
like
that
was
the
reply
the
other
made
the
first
place
it
would
be
dangerous
father
would
be
likely
to
hold
back
just
to
see
what
the
game
of
mendoza
might
now
i
get
on
to
what
you
mean
exclaimed
bob
legal
language
or
as
the
police
would
say
be
better
satisfied
to
catch
him
with
the
goods
trying
to
set
a
fire
for
instance
and
let
me
say
frank
your
father
would
show
what
call
good
sound
horse
sense
if
he
did
let
the
fellow
have
rope
that
way
but
say
i
hope
he
tells
a
few
of
the
boys
feel
safer
if
we
had
enough
fellows
handy
to
stop
mendoza
when
he
starts
to
get
on
it
he
will
bob
dad
never
takes
chances
on
such
things
handled
too
many
deals
with
tough
customers
to
think
of
going
to
sleep
but
getting
close
in
now
and
better
act
natural
if
you
look
around
at
every
mexican
we
happen
to
meet
be
too
suspicious
try
and
forget
that
we
suspect
a
snake
is
warming
himself
at
the
circle
ranch
fires
this
right
frank
replied
the
other
cheerfully
on
to
what
you
say
and
worry
about
my
giving
it
away
but
the
work
is
through
for
because
i
can
see
the
boys
gathering
in
bunches
while
they
wait
for
ah
sin
to
beat
the
gong
for
supper
but
i
want
to
be
with
you
when
you
tell
your
father
the
story
chapter
xxi
setting
the
trap
just
as
bob
had
remarked
the
hard
work
of
the
first
day
of
the
grand
seemed
to
be
done
the
cowboys
had
taken
their
wearied
mounts
to
the
corral
and
were
themselves
gathering
in
little
knots
to
talk
over
the
exciting
events
marking
the
start
of
the
regular
fall
it
promised
to
be
a
banner
year
for
circle
ranch
there
were
half
again
as
many
young
cattle
to
brand
with
the
well
known
ring
designed
to
stamp
them
as
the
property
of
colonel
haywood
besides
the
main
herd
had
wintered
better
the
preceding
year
than
for
a
long
time
there
had
been
less
loss
through
wolves
and
the
depredations
of
rustlers
and
to
cap
the
climax
many
unclaimed
cows
and
steers
had
fallen
to
the
colonel
after
his
raid
on
lost
valley
all
these
things
made
everybody
feel
as
the
cow
punchers
themselves
expressed
it
and
as
frank
and
bob
passed
group
after
group
they
could
see
that
tired
as
the
workers
must
be
this
feeling
was
constantly
cropping
out
seems
to
think
of
anything
like
danger
right
now
said
bob
in
a
low
tone
as
they
passed
a
bunch
of
the
wild
riders
among
whom
were
several
mexicans
should
say
not
echoed
his
chum
see
they
believe
our
friend
mendoza
is
across
the
border
before
now
and
likely
to
stay
on
mexican
soil
for
some
time
if
he
knows
good
for
his
you
notice
that
fellow
on
the
outskirts
of
the
bunch
and
how
he
turned
deliberately
around
to
look
at
us
when
we
rode
past
asked
bob
came
the
quick
reply
if
we
know
what
we
did
i
reckon
neither
of
us
would
have
thought
it
queer
for
him
to
do
that
if
a
stranger
here
as
seems
likely
it
would
be
only
natural
for
him
to
look
when
one
of
the
others
remarked
that
the
son
was
agree
with
you
there
frank
but
seeing
that
we
know
something
you
admit
that
there
was
something
suspicious
in
the
quick
way
he
turned
for
my
part
i
only
gave
him
one
peep
as
i
waved
my
hand
to
the
lot
but
that
seemed
to
tell
me
he
was
frowning
to
beat
the
band
how
what
he
was
you
noticed
that
too
did
you
demanded
the
kentucky
boy
eagerly
question
about
it
and
three
to
one
that
fellow
is
no
other
that
the
rustler
been
such
a
nuisance
around
here
for
several
years
frank
replied
bob
whistled
as
was
his
usual
fashion
when
surprised
think
of
his
nerve
would
you
frank
they
say
got
more
than
his
share
of
that
all
right
chuckled
his
chum
as
they
headed
toward
the
horse
corral
to
leave
their
mounts
in
the
care
of
the
man
who
had
charge
there
of
these
punchers
must
have
known
him
he
used
to
be
on
a
ranch
once
told
bob
went
on
so
said
frank
slowly
it
was
years
ago
that
he
broke
loose
and
took
to
an
easier
way
of
getting
a
herd
than
raising
cattle
besides
you
must
remember
we
agreed
he
would
shave
his
face
clean
to
start
with
that
must
make
a
big
change
in
any
mexican
and
he
can
keep
his
hat
well
down
over
his
eyes
last
of
all
he
relies
on
the
fact
that
nobody
dreams
he
would
take
such
risks
as
to
come
here
right
after
leaving
their
horses
the
boys
headed
straight
for
the
ranch
house
where
they
asked
for
colonel
haywood
it
chanced
that
he
was
in
his
business
office
in
consultation
with
the
overseer
which
fact
pleased
frank
since
bart
heminway
would
have
to
be
put
in
touch
with
the
truth
concerning
the
presence
of
the
notorious
rustler
at
the
circle
ranch
the
stockman
looked
up
as
the
lads
entered
and
smiled
from
your
little
gallop
eh
he
remarked
for
he
had
seen
them
starting
forth
and
wondered
at
the
powers
of
endurance
shown
by
both
boys
and
horses
for
they
had
been
pretty
busy
all
that
stirring
day
dad
and
with
some
news
that
will
make
you
sit
up
and
take
notice
i
reckon
replied
frank
after
glancing
around
to
make
sure
there
was
no
chance
of
his
being
overheard
by
way
of
the
open
window
bob
had
by
arrangement
stepped
over
and
taken
up
his
position
where
he
could
occasionally
thrust
his
head
outside
a
window
and
in
this
way
make
sure
no
listener
was
crouching
near
the
wall
of
the
building
you
have
me
guessing
son
remarked
the
stockman
to
one
something
about
that
mendoza
exclaimed
the
overseer
who
had
never
ceased
to
lament
the
fact
that
they
had
allowed
the
rustler
to
escape
so
easily
from
the
fact
of
bob
laughing
at
this
chance
remark
the
stockman
realized
that
bart
had
hit
pretty
close
to
the
line
about
him
now
frank
he
asked
cross
the
boundary
after
all
dad
said
the
boy
is
come
back
to
this
region
bent
on
getting
his
revenge
for
what
the
circle
ranch
outfit
did
to
knock
his
game
to
did
you
get
this
interesting
news
son
asked
the
other
frowning
for
well
he
knew
that
it
meant
trouble
of
some
sort
happened
to
run
across
that
old
moqui
havasupai
when
we
were
riding
just
now
he
was
about
tired
out
but
bent
on
getting
to
the
ranch
house
some
time
he
told
us
that
after
riding
off
many
miles
to
the
south
with
his
men
mendoza
had
slipped
away
and
headed
back
this
frank
how
did
the
indian
know
what
the
rustler
had
in
mind
think
he
overheard
a
talk
between
mendoza
and
one
of
his
men
the
boy
replied
rustler
was
angry
at
the
slick
way
we
shut
him
up
that
day
and
walked
all
his
cattle
off
as
well
as
our
own
he
said
he
was
going
to
pay
you
up
if
it
was
the
last
thing
he
ever
did
and
dad
i
reckon
right
here
now
in
the
thick
of
the
ready
to
strike
before
another
morning
colonel
haywood
and
his
overseer
exchanged
glances
ekal
to
it
colonel
declared
bart
i
think
of
the
bold
games
that
fellar
has
engineered
through
all
these
years
and
the
way
he
gave
us
the
merry
laugh
every
time
we
hunted
him
ready
to
admit
be
ready
to
drop
in
whar
fifty
enemies
was
gathered
and
make
he
was
one
of
and
sure
several
mexican
ropers
along
i
never
set
eyes
on
before
just
as
like
as
not
one
of
might
be
the
moqui
know
what
sort
of
revenge
this
fellow
expected
to
take
frank
the
stockman
continued
uneasily
know
whether
he
was
only
guessing
or
knew
about
it
replied
the
boy
he
said
something
about
his
poisoning
the
where
most
of
our
cattle
drink
or
else
burning
the
building
while
all
of
us
were
sleeping
one
would
be
bad
enough
declared
the
stockman
now
that
we
have
been
forewarned
have
to
be
a
clever
man
who
can
accomplish
such
a
will
you
do
dad
asked
frank
eagerly
of
all
put
a
guard
over
the
spring
who
will
remain
in
hiding
with
orders
to
shoot
down
any
man
seen
to
be
tampering
with
the
water
especially
if
he
looks
like
a
mexican
replied
the
rancher
firmly
about
burning
the
buildings
continued
frank
make
sure
to
be
ready
for
him
here
the
stockman
continued
would
please
me
first
class
to
catch
the
in
the
act
of
course
now
that
we
believe
mendoza
is
here
for
some
evil
purpose
we
could
jump
on
him
without
warning
that
might
suit
most
people
but
always
been
my
plan
to
let
a
rascal
go
the
length
of
his
rope
before
nabbing
told
bob
that
dad
remarked
frank
will
you
let
all
the
boys
in
on
the
game
at
all
frank
i
might
tell
several
who
can
be
trusted
to
keep
a
still
tongue
in
their
heads
for
we
shall
need
a
certain
amount
of
help
here
to
watch
the
house
on
all
sides
and
get
the
fellow
just
as
he
strikes
his
match
old
hank
coombs
came
in
just
before
you
did
and
is
around
of
course
i
shall
count
on
him
as
well
as
on
ted
conway
scotty
and
jeff
you
will
let
us
sit
up
with
the
bunch
dad
after
bringing
in
the
news
you
shut
us
off
would
you
frank
asked
seem
right
i
admit
after
all
the
good
work
you
two
boys
have
done
remarked
the
stockman
have
to
promise
to
hold
back
and
let
some
of
the
husky
men
do
the
actual
hard
work
i
afford
to
take
the
chances
of
my
boys
getting
hurt
by
such
a
desperate
of
course
both
of
them
readily
promised
and
after
some
further
conversation
frank
and
his
chum
hurried
out
the
coming
of
old
hank
coombs
to
the
ranch
was
an
event
that
greatly
pleased
frank
much
that
he
knew
about
life
in
the
open
had
come
through
the
kindly
instruction
of
the
veteran
cow
puncher
and
hunter
and
the
boy
could
look
back
to
many
a
happy
night
spent
with
old
hank
beside
a
fire
somewhere
out
on
the
plains
or
in
the
mountains
circle
ranch
was
a
bustling
hive
just
then
scores
of
strangers
were
apt
to
visit
the
place
during
the
several
days
that
the
drive
and
the
were
on
interested
in
the
great
event
men
representing
big
papers
and
magazines
in
the
east
had
come
to
see
how
these
things
were
conducted
for
the
stock
raising
business
in
the
southwest
was
soon
going
into
a
decline
because
farms
were
being
taken
up
everywhere
under
the
wonderful
new
system
of
irrigation
that
was
being
put
into
practice
in
many
localities
after
supper
there
was
heard
the
sound
of
merry
music
some
of
the
boys
played
the
mandolin
or
banjo
others
sang
and
a
few
even
tried
to
dance
with
their
customary
vigor
though
weariness
compelled
them
to
speedily
abandon
this
form
of
hilarity
colonel
haywood
had
carried
out
all
his
plans
for
the
campaign
looking
to
the
arrest
of
the
rustler
he
had
sent
a
reliable
man
to
the
where
the
cattle
drank
with
strict
orders
as
to
what
he
should
do
if
anyone
came
and
acted
suspiciously
during
the
night
no
mercy
was
to
be
shown
a
man
who
would
descend
to
such
a
pass
as
to
try
and
poison
an
entire
herd
of
cattle
just
to
have
revenge
on
the
man
who
had
broken
up
his
unlawful
trade
bart
heminway
talked
to
the
four
cowboys
wanted
at
the
house
and
they
had
managed
to
slip
indoors
they
were
now
waiting
to
be
placed
on
their
several
stations
by
the
stockman
who
exhibited
some
of
the
qualities
of
a
general
in
managing
his
affairs
the
saddle
boys
had
taken
up
their
position
in
a
spot
close
to
ted
conway
and
old
hank
in
figuring
out
just
where
the
intended
attack
might
come
this
particular
place
had
been
deemed
first
choice
the
direction
of
the
night
wind
convinced
colonel
haywood
that
a
shrewd
man
who
wished
to
fire
the
buildings
would
be
apt
to
select
it
as
his
starting
point
it
was
a
dark
night
too
despite
the
fact
that
there
was
supposed
to
be
a
moon
back
of
the
heavy
clouds
which
covered
the
heavens
once
having
taken
up
their
position
frank
and
bob
knew
that
they
must
remain
as
still
as
a
cat
watching
for
a
mouse
to
show
at
a
hole
in
the
flooring
there
was
no
telling
when
the
enemy
might
appear
after
having
started
the
blaze
if
that
proved
the
intention
of
the
rustler
he
would
have
his
plans
laid
to
gallop
madly
away
on
the
freshest
horse
in
the
corral
and
thus
laugh
at
pursuit
tired
after
the
labors
of
that
wonderful
day
the
cowboys
had
sought
their
bunks
sooner
than
usual
by
ten
all
had
become
silent
around
the
place
here
and
there
a
fire
smouldered
past
which
an
occasional
figure
might
be
seen
to
shuffle
or
it
might
be
a
dog
wandering
around
looking
for
bones
frank
and
bob
lay
close
never
moving
a
muscle
though
to
the
latter
it
was
indeed
hard
work
an
hour
two
of
them
had
crept
along
and
nothing
happened
bob
even
began
to
wonder
whether
after
all
there
might
not
be
some
mistake
or
whether
the
nerve
had
failed
him
in
the
pinch
then
he
felt
a
slight
nudge
in
the
region
of
his
ribs
that
came
from
elbow
this
warned
him
that
his
chum
had
caught
some
suspicious
movement
close
by
perhaps
the
rustler
was
coming
bent
on
carrying
out
his
scheme
of
firing
the
buildings
belonging
to
circle
ranch
bob
held
his
breath
and
waited
to
see
what
would
speedily
happen
chapter
xxii
caught
in
the
that
crackling
sound
which
came
to
strained
ears
he
knew
must
mean
that
a
match
had
been
struck
yes
he
could
see
the
sudden
little
glow
and
even
managed
to
catch
a
view
of
a
dark
face
hovering
over
some
fuel
that
the
had
carried
with
him
to
the
spot
this
immediately
flashed
into
flame
indicating
that
mendoza
in
order
in
make
sure
of
a
good
start
had
soaked
the
material
with
some
inflammable
substance
perhaps
kerosene
bob
knew
that
something
was
apt
to
happen
about
that
time
nor
was
he
at
all
mistaken
he
saw
a
dark
figure
drop
down
upon
the
crouching
and
heard
a
startled
exclamation
then
the
two
men
went
whirling
over
the
ground
locked
in
a
close
embrace
way
bob
cried
frank
rushing
forward
to
stamp
out
the
rapidly
spreading
flames
for
that
work
had
been
given
over
to
their
charge
hank
will
help
ted
kick
lively
now
and
scatter
the
fire
they
worked
at
a
furious
rate
and
soon
had
the
flames
under
control
others
had
meanwhile
come
dashing
to
the
jeff
davis
bart
the
foreman
and
last
though
far
from
least
the
stockman
himself
old
hank
coombs
had
taken
a
hand
in
the
game
and
mendoza
was
speedily
overcome
though
he
writhed
and
squirmed
to
the
last
uttering
harsh
words
intended
for
the
owner
of
the
ranch
will
they
do
with
him
frank
asked
bob
as
he
saw
signs
that
indicated
a
general
outpouring
of
the
cowboy
legion
from
the
nearby
and
other
places
where
the
overflow
had
been
lodged
even
bob
realized
that
if
ever
these
furious
fellows
laid
hands
on
mendoza
he
would
meet
with
a
swift
fate
which
perhaps
he
well
deserved
as
he
had
long
been
the
pest
of
the
border
and
a
thorn
in
the
sides
of
all
cattle
raisers
will
do
everything
in
his
power
to
hold
the
boys
quiet
frank
answered
telling
hank
and
ted
to
take
him
right
inside
the
house
and
there
be
kept
i
understood
dad
to
say
sent
word
to
the
sheriff
to
come
around
with
a
posse
in
the
then
perhaps
mendoza
will
get
a
chance
to
work
a
few
years
in
the
penitentiary
after
all
remarked
bob
will
if
the
sheriff
ever
gets
him
to
town
safe
replied
frank
doubtfully
of
course
the
whole
place
was
filled
with
excitement
by
this
time
the
women
in
the
house
had
been
awakened
by
the
noise
but
accustomed
to
all
sorts
of
alarms
they
calmly
waited
to
be
told
what
it
meant
those
who
live
on
cattle
ranches
meet
with
so
much
bordering
on
danger
that
they
learn
to
control
their
nerves
and
this
applies
to
women
as
well
as
men
some
of
the
boys
demanded
that
the
rustler
be
given
over
into
their
hands
and
promised
that
he
would
never
any
cattle
again
to
this
however
the
owner
of
circle
ranch
gave
a
negative
answer
he
deserves
all
you
would
give
him
boys
he
announced
when
they
came
clamoring
for
mendoza
fortunately
we
were
able
to
nip
his
miserable
scheme
in
the
bud
and
no
damage
was
done
so
as
the
sheriff
of
the
county
will
be
here
in
the
morning
i
expect
to
turn
him
over
and
see
that
he
gets
a
long
term
and
remember
boys
he
added
seriously
would
be
a
dangerous
thing
for
anybody
to
try
and
enter
this
house
they
knew
what
he
meant
and
that
when
colonel
haywood
spoke
in
that
vein
he
was
not
to
be
taken
lightly
though
there
was
more
or
less
grumbling
still
the
remainder
of
that
night
passed
away
without
any
disturbance
no
doubt
mendoza
having
had
a
chance
to
cool
down
and
repent
of
his
rashness
was
glad
to
see
the
break
of
early
dawn
the
sheriff
did
come
along
about
noon
while
the
cowboys
were
partaking
of
their
midday
meal
and
knowing
what
a
task
he
might
have
before
him
he
brought
a
large
posse
of
deputies
along
in
order
to
protect
his
prisoner
the
last
the
saddle
boys
saw
of
the
mexican
rustler
he
was
galloping
off
between
several
heavily
armed
riders
and
laughing
mockingly
at
the
crowd
that
gathered
to
see
him
depart
the
stockman
did
all
in
his
power
to
keep
any
of
his
employers
from
deserting
the
in
order
to
try
and
wrest
the
prisoner
away
from
his
guards
and
so
successful
were
his
efforts
that
mendoza
was
landed
in
the
it
might
be
said
of
him
that
in
due
time
he
received
the
reward
of
his
crimes
and
was
sent
to
the
penitentiary
for
a
long
term
unless
he
should
manage
to
escape
at
some
time
the
cattlemen
of
the
southwest
can
breathe
easy
for
years
to
come
for
the
rustler
will
in
all
probability
never
be
seen
again
the
old
moqui
had
arrived
at
the
ranch
about
midnight
indeed
he
was
just
in
time
to
see
the
capture
of
the
man
who
had
caused
him
so
much
mental
suffering
in
connection
with
his
one
daughter
antelope
colonel
haywood
was
not
the
one
to
forget
a
promise
he
had
made
and
as
soon
as
the
grand
was
a
thing
of
the
past
he
set
to
work
trying
to
find
where
mendoza
had
hidden
his
moqui
wife
as
one
of
the
cattlemen
had
been
able
to
give
him
a
hint
concerning
this
success
greeted
the
efforts
of
the
ranchman
before
long
havasupai
was
enabled
to
once
more
claim
his
daughter
he
could
not
return
to
his
village
for
there
was
a
perpetual
edict
of
banishment
issued
against
him
so
as
the
stockman
offered
him
a
chance
to
remain
at
circle
ranch
and
be
entered
on
the
regular
payroll
as
a
scout
hunter
and
tracker
of
lost
cattle
havasupai
settled
down
to
his
new
life
the
boys
were
glad
of
this
since
both
of
them
had
taken
a
decided
liking
to
the
old
indian
and
hank
coombs
struck
up
a
close
friendship
with
havasupai
they
having
many
interests
in
common
on
the
very
day
after
the
grand
had
closed
with
circle
ranch
resuming
its
ordinary
aspect
the
saddle
boys
started
out
on
what
everybody
supposed
was
simply
a
hunt
for
fresh
venison
or
a
chance
to
pot
some
daring
wolf
found
abroad
in
the
daytime
but
bob
had
another
mission
on
his
mind
i
hope
i
find
it
there
frank
he
said
for
the
fourth
time
as
later
on
they
drew
rapidly
near
a
of
timber
that
marked
some
miles
away
from
the
ranch
proper
i
give
you
my
word
i
wish
it
just
as
much
as
you
can
do
chuckled
the
other
giving
his
chum
a
meaning
look
suppose
i
have
bothered
you
a
heap
frank
what
with
my
guessing
and
asking
all
sorts
of
silly
questions
bob
went
on
if
you
only
knew
how
much
i
think
of
that
knife
you
be
not
blaming
you
bob
not
a
bit
of
it
laughed
the
other
was
only
thinking
of
that
dream
you
had
and
wondering
if
it
could
come
out
true
with
the
knife
sticking
in
that
tree
just
as
you
saw
it
while
asleep
if
it
does
turn
out
that
way
why
believe
your
spirit
must
have
wandered
out
here
while
your
body
lay
there
alongside
me
but
in
a
few
minutes
now
know
the
the
best
frank
cried
bob
discourage
me
right
now
when
you
can
see
how
keyed
up
to
where
you
crept
up
on
the
deer
and
fired
frank
remarked
pointing
and
i
can
follow
the
track
i
took
into
the
timber
every
foot
of
it
bob
called
back
over
his
shoulder
for
in
his
eagerness
he
was
outstripping
his
chum
though
frank
was
content
to
have
it
so
seeing
that
i
cut
up
the
deer
as
you
