preface
the
purpose
of
this
book
is
exactly
expressed
in
its
title
key
to
theosophy
and
needs
but
few
words
of
explanation
it
is
not
a
complete
or
exhaustive
of
theosophy
but
only
a
key
to
unlock
the
door
that
leads
to
the
deeper
study
it
traces
the
broad
outlines
of
the
wisdom
religion
and
explains
its
fundamental
principles
meeting
at
the
same
time
the
various
objections
raised
by
the
average
western
enquirer
and
endeavouring
to
present
unfamiliar
concepts
in
a
form
as
simple
and
in
language
as
clear
as
possible
that
it
should
succeed
in
making
theosophy
intelligible
without
mental
effort
on
the
part
of
the
reader
would
be
too
much
to
expect
but
it
is
hoped
that
the
obscurity
still
left
is
of
the
thought
not
of
the
language
is
due
to
depth
not
to
confusion
to
the
mentally
lazy
or
obtuse
theosophy
must
remain
a
riddle
for
in
the
world
mental
as
in
the
world
spiritual
each
man
must
progress
by
his
own
efforts
the
writer
can
not
do
the
thinking
for
him
nor
would
the
latter
be
any
the
better
off
if
such
vicarious
thought
were
possible
the
need
for
such
an
exposition
as
the
present
has
long
been
felt
among
those
interested
in
the
theosophical
society
and
its
work
and
it
is
hoped
that
it
will
supply
information
as
free
as
possible
from
technicalities
to
many
whose
attention
has
been
awakened
but
who
as
yet
are
merely
puzzled
and
not
convinced
some
care
has
been
taken
in
disentangling
some
part
of
what
is
true
from
what
is
false
in
spiritualistic
teachings
as
to
the
life
and
to
showing
the
true
nature
of
spiritualistic
phænomena
previous
explanations
of
a
similar
kind
have
drawn
much
wrath
upon
the
devoted
head
the
spiritualists
like
too
many
others
preferring
to
believe
what
is
pleasant
rather
than
what
is
true
and
becoming
very
angry
with
anyone
who
destroys
an
agreeable
delusion
for
the
past
year
theosophy
has
been
the
target
for
every
poisoned
arrow
of
spiritualism
as
though
the
possessors
of
a
half
truth
felt
more
antagonism
to
the
possessors
of
the
whole
truth
than
those
who
had
no
share
to
boast
of
very
hearty
thanks
are
due
from
the
author
to
many
theosophists
who
have
sent
suggestions
and
questions
or
have
otherwise
contributed
help
during
the
writing
of
this
book
the
work
will
be
the
more
useful
for
their
aid
and
that
will
be
their
best
reward

theosophy
and
the
theosophical
society
the
meaning
of
the
name
enquirer
theosophy
and
its
doctrines
are
often
referred
to
as
a
religion
is
it
a
religion
theosophist
it
is
not
theosophy
is
divine
knowledge
or
science
enq
what
is
the
real
meaning
of
the
term
theo
wisdom
θεοσοφία
theosophia
or
wisdom
of
the
gods
as
θεογονία
theogonia
genealogy
of
the
gods
the
word
θεὸς
means
a
god
in
greek
one
of
the
divine
beings
certainly
not
in
the
sense
attached
in
our
day
to
the
term
therefore
it
is
not
of
god
as
translated
by
some
but
such
as
that
possessed
by
the
gods
the
term
is
many
thousand
years
old
enq
what
is
the
origin
of
the
name
theo
it
comes
to
us
from
the
alexandrian
philosophers
called
lovers
of
truth
philatheians
from
φιλ
phil
and
ἀλήθεια
aletheia
the
name
theosophy
dates
from
the
third
century
of
our
era
and
began
with
ammonius
saccas
and
his
disciples
who
started
the
eclectic
theosophical
system
enq
what
was
the
object
of
this
system
theo
first
of
all
to
inculcate
certain
great
moral
truths
upon
its
disciples
and
all
those
who
were
of
the
hence
the
motto
adopted
by
the
theosophical
society
is
no
religion
higher
than
the
chief
aim
of
the
founders
of
the
eclectic
theosophical
school
was
one
of
the
three
objects
of
its
modern
successor
the
theosophical
society
namely
to
reconcile
all
religions
sects
and
nations
under
a
common
system
of
ethics
based
on
eternal
verities
enq
what
have
you
to
show
that
this
is
not
an
impossible
dream
and
that
all
the
religions
based
on
the
one
and
the
same
truth
theo
their
comparative
study
and
analysis
the
was
one
in
antiquity
and
the
sameness
of
primitive
religious
philosophy
is
proven
to
us
by
the
identical
doctrines
taught
to
the
initiates
during
the
mysteries
an
institution
once
universally
diffused
the
old
worships
indicate
the
existence
of
a
single
theosophy
anterior
to
them
the
key
that
is
to
open
one
must
open
all
otherwise
it
can
not
be
the
right
eclect
philo
the
policy
of
the
theosophical
society
enq
in
the
days
of
ammonius
there
were
several
ancient
great
religions
and
numerous
were
the
sects
in
egypt
and
palestine
alone
how
could
he
reconcile
them
theo
by
doing
that
which
we
again
try
to
do
now
the
were
a
large
body
and
belonged
to
various
religious
philosophies
so
do
our
theosophists
in
those
days
the
jew
aristobulus
affirmed
that
the
ethics
of
aristotle
represented
the
teachings
of
the
law
of
moses
philo
judæus
endeavoured
to
reconcile
the
with
the
pythagorean
and
platonic
philosophy
and
josephus
proved
that
the
essenes
of
carmel
were
simply
the
copyists
and
followers
of
the
egyptian
therapeutæ
the
healers
so
it
is
in
our
day
we
can
show
the
line
of
descent
of
every
christian
religion
as
of
every
even
the
smallest
sect
the
latter
are
the
minor
twigs
or
shoots
grown
on
the
larger
branches
but
shoots
and
branches
spring
from
the
same
to
prove
this
was
the
aim
of
ammonius
who
endeavoured
to
induce
gentiles
and
christians
jews
and
idolators
to
lay
aside
their
contentions
and
strifes
remembering
only
that
they
were
all
in
possession
of
the
same
truth
under
various
vestments
and
were
all
the
children
of
a
common
mother
this
is
the
aim
of
theosophy
likewise
enq
what
are
your
authorities
for
saying
this
of
the
ancient
theosophists
of
alexandria
theo
an
almost
countless
number
of
writers
mosheim
one
of
them
says
that
taught
that
the
religion
of
the
multitude
went
with
philosophy
and
with
her
had
shared
the
fate
of
being
by
degrees
corrupted
and
obscured
with
mere
human
conceits
superstitions
and
lies
that
it
ought
therefore
to
be
brought
back
to
its
original
purity
by
purging
it
of
this
dross
and
expounding
it
upon
philosophical
principles
and
the
whole
christ
had
in
view
was
to
reinstate
and
restore
to
its
primitive
integrity
the
wisdom
of
the
ancients
to
reduce
within
bounds
the
dominion
of
superstition
and
in
part
to
correct
and
in
part
to
exterminate
the
various
errors
that
had
found
their
way
into
the
different
popular
this
again
is
precisely
what
the
modern
theosophists
say
only
while
the
great
philaletheian
was
supported
and
helped
in
the
policy
he
pursued
by
two
church
fathers
clement
and
athenagoras
by
all
the
learned
rabbis
of
the
synagogue
the
academy
and
the
groves
and
while
he
taught
a
common
doctrine
for
all
we
his
followers
on
the
same
line
receive
no
recognition
but
on
the
contrary
are
abused
and
persecuted
people
years
ago
are
thus
shown
to
have
been
more
tolerant
than
they
are
in
this
century
enq
was
he
encouraged
and
supported
by
the
church
because
notwithstanding
his
heresies
ammonius
taught
christianity
and
was
a
christian
theo
not
at
all
he
was
born
a
christian
but
never
accepted
church
christianity
as
said
of
him
by
the
same
writer
had
but
to
propound
his
instructions
according
to
the
ancient
pillars
of
hermes
which
plato
and
pythagoras
knew
before
and
from
them
constituted
their
philosophy
finding
the
same
in
the
prologue
of
the
gospel
according
to
john
he
very
properly
supposed
that
the
purpose
of
jesus
was
to
restore
the
great
doctrine
of
wisdom
in
its
primitive
integrity
the
narratives
of
the
bible
and
the
stories
of
the
gods
he
considered
to
be
allegories
illustrative
of
the
truth
or
else
fables
to
be
moreover
as
says
the
acknowledged
that
jesus
christ
was
an
excellent
and
the
of
god
but
alleged
that
it
was
not
his
design
entirely
to
abolish
the
worship
of
demons
gods
and
that
his
only
intention
was
to
purify
the
ancient
the
esoteric
in
all
ages
enq
since
ammonius
never
committed
anything
to
writing
how
can
one
feel
sure
that
such
were
his
teachings
theo
neither
did
buddha
pythagoras
confucius
orpheus
socrates
or
even
jesus
leave
behind
them
any
writings
yet
most
of
these
are
historical
personages
and
their
teachings
have
all
survived
the
disciples
of
ammonius
among
whom
origen
and
herennius
wrote
treatises
and
explained
his
ethics
certainly
the
latter
are
as
historical
if
not
more
so
than
the
apostolic
writings
moreover
his
plotinus
and
longinus
counsellor
of
the
famous
queen
zenobia
all
left
voluminous
records
of
the
philaletheian
far
at
all
events
as
their
public
profession
of
faith
was
known
for
the
school
was
divided
into
exoteric
and
teachings
enq
how
have
the
latter
tenets
reached
our
day
since
you
hold
that
what
is
properly
called
the
was
esoteric
theo
the
was
ever
one
and
being
the
last
word
of
possible
human
knowledge
was
therefore
carefully
preserved
it
preceded
by
long
ages
the
alexandrian
theosophists
reached
the
modern
and
will
survive
every
other
religion
and
philosophy
enq
where
and
by
whom
was
it
so
preserved
theo
among
initiates
of
every
country
among
profound
seekers
after
disciples
and
in
those
parts
of
the
world
where
such
topics
have
always
been
most
valued
and
pursued
in
india
central
asia
and
persia
enq
can
you
give
me
some
proofs
of
its
esotericism
theo
the
best
proof
you
can
have
of
the
fact
is
that
every
ancient
religious
or
rather
philosophical
cult
consisted
of
an
esoteric
or
secret
teaching
and
an
exoteric
outward
public
worship
furthermore
it
is
a
fact
that
the
mysteries
of
the
ancients
comprised
with
every
nation
the
secret
and
public
in
the
celebrated
solemnities
called
the
in
greece
from
the
hierophants
of
samothrace
egypt
and
the
initiated
brahmins
of
the
india
of
old
down
to
the
later
hebrew
rabbis
all
preserved
for
fear
of
profanation
their
real
beliefs
secret
the
jewish
rabbis
called
their
secular
religious
series
the
the
exterior
body
vehicle
or
covering
which
contains
the
hidden
their
highest
secret
knowledge
not
one
of
the
ancient
nations
ever
imparted
through
its
priests
its
real
philosophical
secrets
to
the
masses
but
allotted
to
the
latter
only
the
husks
northern
buddhism
has
its
and
its
vehicle
known
as
the
the
esoteric
and
the
the
exoteric
schools
nor
can
you
blame
them
for
such
secrecy
for
surely
you
would
not
think
of
feeding
your
flock
of
sheep
on
learned
dissertations
on
botany
instead
of
on
grass
pythagoras
called
his
knowledge
of
things
that
are
or
ἡ
γνῶσις
τῶν
ὄντων
and
preserved
that
knowledge
for
his
pledged
disciples
only
for
those
who
could
digest
such
mental
food
and
feel
satisfied
and
he
pledged
them
to
silence
and
secrecy
occult
alphabets
and
secret
ciphers
are
the
development
of
the
old
egyptian
writings
the
secret
of
which
was
in
the
days
of
old
in
the
possession
only
of
the
hierogrammatists
or
initiated
egyptian
priests
ammonius
saccas
as
his
biographers
tell
us
bound
his
pupils
by
oath
not
to
divulge
higher
except
to
those
who
had
already
been
instructed
in
preliminary
knowledge
and
who
were
also
bound
by
a
pledge
finally
do
we
not
find
the
same
even
in
early
christianity
among
the
gnostics
and
even
in
the
teachings
of
christ
did
he
not
speak
to
the
multitudes
in
parables
which
had
a
meaning
and
explain
his
reasons
only
to
his
disciples
you
he
says
is
given
to
know
the
mysteries
of
the
kingdom
of
heaven
but
unto
them
that
are
without
all
these
things
are
done
in
mark
iv
essenes
of
judea
and
carmel
made
similar
distinctions
dividing
their
adherents
into
neophytes
brethren
and
the
or
those
eclec
examples
might
be
brought
from
every
country
to
this
effect
enq
can
you
attain
the
simply
by
study
encyclopædias
define
pretty
much
as
dictionary
does
as
intercourse
with
god
and
superior
spirits
and
consequent
attainment
of
superhuman
knowledge
by
physical
means
and
chemical
is
this
so
theo
i
think
not
nor
is
there
any
lexicographer
capable
of
explaining
whether
to
himself
or
others
how
knowledge
can
be
attained
by
or
chemical
processes
had
webster
said
and
alchemical
processes
the
definition
would
be
approximately
correct
as
it
is
it
is
absurd
ancient
theosophists
claimed
and
so
do
the
modern
that
the
infinite
can
not
be
known
by
the
sensed
by
the
finite
that
the
divine
essence
could
be
communicated
to
the
higher
spiritual
self
in
a
state
of
ecstacy
this
condition
can
hardly
be
attained
like
by
and
chemical
enq
what
is
your
explanation
of
it
theo
real
ecstacy
was
defined
by
plotinus
as
liberation
of
the
mind
from
its
finite
consciousness
becoming
one
and
identified
with
the
this
is
the
highest
condition
says
wilder
but
not
one
of
permanent
duration
and
it
is
reached
only
by
the
very
few
it
is
indeed
identical
with
that
state
which
is
known
in
india
as
the
latter
is
practised
by
the
yogis
who
facilitate
it
physically
by
the
greatest
abstinence
in
food
and
drink
and
mentally
by
an
incessant
endeavour
to
purify
and
elevate
the
mind
meditation
is
silent
and
prayer
or
as
plato
expressed
it
ardent
turning
of
the
soul
toward
the
divine
not
to
ask
any
particular
good
as
in
the
common
meaning
of
prayer
but
for
good
the
universal
supreme
of
which
we
are
a
part
on
earth
and
out
of
the
essence
of
which
we
have
all
emerged
therefore
adds
plato
silent
in
the
presence
of
the
till
they
remove
the
clouds
from
thy
eyes
and
enable
thee
to
see
by
the
light
which
issues
from
themselves
not
what
appears
as
good
to
thee
but
what
is
intrinsically
enq
theosophy
then
is
not
as
held
by
some
a
newly
devised
scheme
theo
only
ignorant
people
can
thus
refer
to
it
it
is
as
old
as
the
world
in
its
teachings
and
ethics
if
not
in
name
as
it
is
also
the
broadest
and
most
catholic
system
among
all
enq
how
comes
it
then
that
theosophy
has
remained
so
unknown
to
the
nations
of
the
western
hemisphere
why
should
it
have
been
a
sealed
book
to
races
confessedly
the
most
cultured
and
advanced
theo
we
believe
there
were
nations
as
cultured
in
days
of
old
and
certainly
more
spiritually
than
we
are
but
there
are
several
reasons
for
this
willing
ignorance
one
of
them
was
given
by
paul
to
the
cultured
loss
for
long
centuries
of
real
spiritual
insight
and
even
interest
owing
to
their
too
great
devotion
to
things
of
sense
and
their
long
slavery
to
the
dead
letter
of
dogma
and
ritualism
but
the
strongest
reason
for
its
lies
in
the
fact
that
real
theosophy
has
ever
been
kept
secret
enq
you
have
brought
forward
proofs
that
such
secrecy
has
existed
but
what
was
the
real
cause
for
it
theo
the
causes
for
it
were
the
perversity
of
average
human
nature
and
its
selfishness
always
tending
to
the
gratification
of
desires
to
the
detriment
of
neighbours
and
next
of
kin
such
people
could
never
be
entrusted
with
secrets
their
unreliability
to
keep
the
sacred
and
divine
knowledge
from
desecration
it
is
the
latter
that
led
to
the
perversion
of
the
most
sublime
truths
and
symbols
and
to
the
gradual
transformation
of
things
spiritual
into
anthropomorphic
concrete
and
gross
other
words
to
the
dwarfing
of
the
and
to
idolatry
theosophy
is
not
buddhism
enq
you
are
often
spoken
of
as
are
you
then
all
followers
of
gautama
buddha
theo
no
more
than
musicians
are
all
followers
of
wagner
some
of
us
are
buddhists
by
religion
yet
there
are
far
more
hindus
and
brahmins
than
buddhists
among
us
and
more
europeans
and
americans
than
buddhists
the
mistake
has
arisen
from
a
misunderstanding
of
the
real
meaning
of
the
title
of
excellent
work
buddhism
which
last
word
ought
to
have
been
spelt
one
instead
of
two
as
then
would
have
meant
what
it
was
intended
for
merely
bodha
bodhi
instead
of
religious
philosophy
theosophy
as
already
said
is
the
enq
what
is
the
difference
between
buddhism
the
religion
founded
by
the
prince
of
kapilavastu
and
the
which
you
say
is
synonymous
with
theosophy
theo
just
the
same
difference
as
there
is
between
the
secret
teachings
of
christ
which
are
called
mysteries
of
the
kingdom
of
heaven
and
the
later
ritualism
and
dogmatic
theology
of
the
churches
and
sects
means
the
by
or
understanding
wisdom
this
has
passed
root
and
branch
into
the
teachings
that
gautama
imparted
to
his
chosen
only
enq
but
some
orientalists
deny
that
buddha
ever
taught
any
esoteric
doctrine
at
all
theo
they
may
as
well
deny
that
nature
has
any
hidden
secrets
for
the
men
of
science
further
on
i
will
prove
it
by
conversation
with
his
disciple
ananda
his
esoteric
teachings
were
simply
the
secret
knowledge
of
the
ancient
brahmins
the
key
to
which
their
modern
successors
have
with
few
exceptions
completely
lost
and
this
has
passed
into
what
is
now
known
as
the
teachings
of
the
school
of
northern
buddhism
those
who
deny
it
are
simply
ignorant
pretenders
to
orientalism
i
advise
you
to
read
the
rev
the
chapters
on
the
exoteric
and
schools
and
then
compare
the
testimony
of
the
whole
ancient
world
upon
the
subject
enq
but
are
not
the
ethics
of
theosophy
identical
with
those
taught
by
buddha
theo
certainly
because
these
ethics
are
the
soul
of
the
and
were
once
the
common
property
of
the
initiates
of
all
nations
but
buddha
was
the
first
to
embody
these
lofty
ethics
in
his
public
teachings
and
to
make
them
the
foundation
and
the
very
essence
of
his
public
system
it
is
herein
that
lies
the
immense
difference
between
exoteric
buddhism
and
every
other
religion
for
while
in
other
religions
ritualism
and
dogma
hold
the
first
and
most
important
place
in
buddhism
it
is
the
ethics
which
have
always
been
the
most
insisted
upon
this
accounts
for
the
resemblance
amounting
almost
to
identity
between
the
ethics
of
theosophy
and
those
of
the
religion
of
buddha
enq
are
there
any
great
points
of
difference
theo
one
great
distinction
between
theosophy
and
buddhism
is
that
the
latter
represented
by
the
southern
church
entirely
denies
a
the
existence
of
any
deity
and
b
any
conscious
life
or
even
any
surviving
individuality
in
man
such
at
least
is
the
teaching
of
the
siamese
sect
now
considered
as
the
form
of
exoteric
buddhism
and
it
is
so
if
we
refer
only
to
public
teachings
the
reason
for
such
reticence
on
his
part
i
will
give
further
on
but
the
schools
of
the
northern
buddhist
church
established
in
those
countries
to
which
his
initiated
arhats
retired
after
the
death
teach
all
that
is
now
called
theosophical
doctrines
because
they
form
part
of
the
knowledge
of
the
proving
how
the
truth
has
been
sacrificed
to
the
by
the
orthodoxy
of
southern
buddhism
but
how
much
grander
and
more
noble
philosophical
and
scientific
even
in
its
is
this
teaching
than
that
of
any
other
church
or
religion
yet
theosophy
is
not
buddhism
footnotes
also
called
analogeticists
as
explained
by
alex
wilder
in
his
philosophy
they
were
called
so
because
of
their
practice
of
interpreting
all
sacred
legends
and
narratives
myths
and
mysteries
by
a
rule
or
principle
of
analogy
and
correspondence
so
that
events
which
were
related
as
having
occurred
in
the
external
world
were
regarded
as
expressing
operations
and
experiences
of
the
human
soul
they
were
also
denominated
though
theosophy
or
the
eclectic
theosophical
system
is
generally
attributed
to
the
third
century
yet
if
diogenes
laertius
is
to
be
credited
its
origin
is
much
earlier
as
he
attributed
the
system
to
an
egyptian
priest
who
lived
in
the
early
days
of
the
ptolemaic
dynasty
the
same
author
tells
us
that
the
name
is
coptic
and
signifies
one
consecrated
to
amun
the
god
of
wisdom
theosophy
is
the
equivalent
of
divine
knowledge
eclectic
theosophy
was
divided
under
three
heads
belief
in
one
absolute
incomprehensible
and
supreme
deity
or
infinite
essence
which
is
the
root
of
all
nature
and
of
all
that
is
visible
and
invisible
belief
in
eternal
immortal
nature
because
being
a
radiation
of
the
universal
soul
it
is
of
an
identical
essence
with
it
or
work
or
a
work
of
from
and
the
term
is
very
old
but
as
it
belongs
to
the
vocabulary
of
the
mysteries
was
not
in
popular
use
it
was
a
mystic
proven
by
initiated
adepts
and
by
making
oneself
as
pure
as
the
incorporeal
by
returning
to
pristine
purity
of
could
move
the
gods
to
impart
to
him
divine
mysteries
and
even
cause
them
to
become
occasionally
visible
either
subjectively
or
objectively
it
was
the
transcendental
aspect
of
what
is
now
called
spiritualism
but
having
been
abused
and
misconceived
by
the
populace
it
had
come
to
be
regarded
by
some
as
necromancy
and
was
generally
forbidden
a
travestied
practice
of
the
theurgy
of
iamblichus
lingers
still
in
the
ceremonial
magic
of
some
modern
kabalists
modern
theosophy
avoids
and
rejects
both
these
kinds
of
magic
and
as
being
very
dangerous
real
theurgy
requires
an
almost
superhuman
purity
and
holiness
of
life
otherwise
it
degenerates
into
mediumship
or
black
magic
the
immediate
disciples
of
ammonius
saccas
who
was
called
as
plotinus
and
his
follower
theurgy
at
first
but
were
finally
reconciled
to
it
through
iamblichus
who
wrote
a
work
to
that
effect
entitled
mysteriis
under
the
name
of
his
own
master
a
famous
egyptian
priest
called
abammon
ammonius
saccas
was
the
son
of
christian
parents
and
having
been
repelled
by
dogmatic
spiritualistic
christianity
from
his
childhood
became
a
and
like
boehme
and
other
great
seers
and
mystics
is
said
to
have
had
divine
wisdom
revealed
to
him
in
dreams
and
visions
hence
his
name
of
he
resolved
to
reconcile
every
system
of
religion
and
by
demonstrating
their
identical
origin
to
establish
one
universal
creed
based
on
ethics
his
life
was
so
blameless
and
pure
his
learning
so
profound
and
vast
that
several
church
fathers
were
his
secret
disciples
clemens
alexandrinus
speaks
very
highly
of
him
plotinus
the
of
ammonius
was
also
a
man
universally
respected
and
esteemed
and
of
the
most
profound
learning
and
integrity
when
years
of
age
he
accompanied
the
roman
emperor
gordian
and
his
army
to
the
east
to
be
instructed
by
the
sages
of
bactria
and
india
he
had
a
school
of
philosophy
in
rome
porphyry
his
disciple
whose
real
name
was
malek
a
hellenized
jew
collected
all
the
writings
of
his
master
porphyry
was
himself
a
great
author
and
gave
an
allegorical
interpretation
to
some
parts
of
writings
the
system
of
meditation
the
philaletheians
resorted
to
was
ecstacy
a
system
akin
to
indian
yoga
practice
what
is
known
of
the
eclectic
school
is
due
to
origen
longinus
and
plotinus
the
immediate
disciples
of
eclectic
by
wilder
it
was
under
philadelphus
that
judaism
established
itself
in
alexandria
and
forthwith
the
hellenic
teachers
became
the
dangerous
rivals
of
the
college
of
rabbis
of
babylon
as
the
author
of
very
pertinently
remarks
buddhistic
vedantic
and
magian
systems
were
expounded
along
with
the
philosophies
of
greece
at
that
period
it
was
not
wonderful
that
thoughtful
men
supposed
that
the
strife
of
words
ought
to
cease
and
considered
it
possible
to
extract
one
harmonious
system
from
these
various
teachings
panænus
athenagoras
and
clement
were
thoroughly
instructed
in
platonic
philosophy
and
comprehended
its
essential
unity
with
the
oriental
says
mosheim
of
ammonius
that
not
only
the
philosophers
of
greece
but
also
all
those
of
the
different
barbarian
nations
were
perfectly
in
unison
with
each
other
with
regard
to
every
essential
point
he
made
it
his
business
so
to
expound
the
thousand
tenets
of
all
these
various
sects
as
to
show
they
had
all
originated
from
one
and
the
same
source
and
tended
all
to
one
and
the
same
if
the
writer
on
ammonius
in
the
knows
what
he
is
talking
about
then
he
describes
the
modern
theosophists
their
beliefs
and
their
work
for
he
says
speaking
of
the
adopted
the
doctrines
which
were
received
in
egypt
the
esoteric
were
those
of
india
concerning
the
universe
and
the
deity
considered
as
constituting
one
great
whole
concerning
the
eternity
of
the
world
and
established
a
system
of
moral
discipline
which
allowed
the
people
in
general
to
live
according
to
the
laws
of
their
country
and
the
dictates
of
nature
but
required
the
wise
to
exalt
their
mind
by
this
is
what
the
scholarly
author
of
eclectic
philosophy
wilder
describes
as
soul
is
the
camera
in
which
facts
and
events
future
past
and
present
are
alike
fixed
and
the
mind
becomes
conscious
of
them
beyond
our
world
of
limits
all
is
one
day
or
past
and
future
comprised
in
the
is
the
last
on
earth
then
the
soul
is
freed
from
the
constraint
of
the
body
and
its
nobler
part
is
united
to
higher
nature
and
becomes
partaker
in
the
wisdom
and
foreknowledge
of
the
higher
real
theosophy
is
for
the
mystics
that
state
which
apollonius
of
tyana
was
made
to
describe
thus
can
see
the
present
and
the
future
as
in
a
clear
mirror
the
sage
need
not
wait
for
the
vapours
of
the
earth
and
the
corruption
of
the
air
to
foresee
events
the
or
gods
see
the
future
common
men
the
present
sages
that
which
is
about
to
take
theosophy
of
the
he
speaks
of
is
well
expressed
in
the
assertion
kingdom
of
god
is
within
ii
exoteric
and
esoteric
theosophy
what
the
modern
theosophical
society
is
not
enq
your
doctrines
then
are
not
a
revival
of
buddhism
nor
are
they
entirely
copied
from
the
theosophy
theo
they
are
not
but
to
these
questions
i
can
not
give
you
a
better
answer
than
by
quoting
from
a
paper
read
on
by
buck
before
the
last
theosophical
convention
at
chicago
america
april
no
living
theosophist
has
better
expressed
and
understood
the
real
essence
of
theosophy
than
our
honoured
friend
buck
theosophical
society
was
organized
for
the
purpose
of
promulgating
the
theosophical
doctrines
and
for
the
promotion
of
the
theosophic
life
the
present
theosophical
society
is
not
the
first
of
its
kind
i
have
a
volume
entitled
transactions
of
the
philadelphian
society
published
in
london

with
the
following
title
to
theosophy
or
the
science
of
the
mystery
of
christ
that
is
of

nature
and
creature
embracing
the
philosophy
of
all
the
working

and
spiritual
and
forming
a

guide
to
the
sublimest
purity

and

perfection
also
to
the

of

and
the
holy

and
other
prerogatives
of
the

published
in

in
the

the
dedication
of
this
volume
the
students
of
universities
colleges
and
schools
of
christendom
to
professors
of
metaphysical
mechanical
and
natural
science
in

its
forms
to

generally
of

orthodox
faith
to

other
defective

creeds
rationalists
and

enlightened
mohammedans
jews
and
oriental
but
especially
to
the
gospel
minister
and
missionary
whether
to
the
barbaric
or
intellectual
peoples
this
introduction
to
theosophy
or
the
science
of
the
ground
and
mystery
of
all
things
is
most
humbly
and
affectionately
in
the
following
year
another
volume
was
issued
royal
octavo
of
pages
diamond
type
of
of
the
work
copies
only
were
issued
for
gratuitous
distribution
to
libraries
and
universities
these
earlier
movements
of
which
there
were
many
originated
within
the
church
with
persons
of
great
piety
and
earnestness
and
of
unblemished
character
and
all
of
these
writings
were
in
orthodox
form
using
the
christian
expressions
and
like
the
writings
of
the
eminent
churchman
william
law
would
only
be
distinguished
by
the
ordinary
reader
for
their
great
earnestness
and
piety
these
were
one
and
all
but
attempts
to
derive
and
explain
the
deeper
meanings
and
original
import
of
the
christian
scriptures
and
to
illustrate
and
unfold
the
theosophic
life
these
works
were
soon
forgotten
and
are
now
generally
unknown
they
sought
to
reform
the
clergy
and
revive
genuine
piety
and
were
never
welcomed
that
one
word
was
sufficient
to
bury
them
in
the
limbo
of
all
such
utopias
at
the
time
of
the
reformation
john
reuchlin
made
a
similar
attempt
with
the
same
result
though
he
was
the
intimate
and
trusted
friend
of
luther
orthodoxy
never
desired
to
be
informed
and
enlightened
these
reformers
were
informed
as
was
paul
by
festus
that
too
much
learning
had
made
them
mad
and
that
it
would
be
dangerous
to
go
farther
passing
by
the
verbiage
which
was
partly
a
matter
of
habit
and
education
with
these
writers
and
partly
due
to
religious
restraint
through
secular
power
and
coming
to
the
core
of
the
matter
these
writings
were
theosophical
in
the
strictest
sense
and
pertain
solely
to
knowledge
of
his
own
nature
and
the
higher
life
of
the
soul
the
present
theosophical
movement
has
sometimes
been
declared
to
be
an
attempt
to
convert
christendom
to
buddhism
which
means
simply
that
the
word
has
lost
its
terrors
and
relinquished
its
power
individuals
in
every
age
have
more
or
less
clearly
apprehended
the
theosophical
doctrines
and
wrought
them
into
the
fabric
of
their
lives
these
doctrines
belong
exclusively
to
no
religion
and
are
confined
to
no
society
or
time
they
are
the
birthright
of
every
human
soul
such
a
thing
as
orthodoxy
must
be
wrought
out
by
each
individual
according
to
his
nature
and
his
needs
and
according
to
his
varying
experience
this
may
explain
why
those
who
have
imagined
theosophy
to
be
a
new
religion
have
hunted
in
vain
for
its
creed
and
its
ritual
its
creed
is
loyalty
to
truth
and
its
ritual
honour
every
truth
by
how
little
this
principle
of
universal
brotherhood
is
understood
by
the
masses
of
mankind
how
seldom
its
transcendent
importance
is
recognised
may
be
seen
in
the
diversity
of
opinion
and
fictitious
interpretations
regarding
the
theosophical
society
this
society
was
organized
on
this
one
principle
the
essential
brotherhood
of
man
as
herein
briefly
outlined
and
imperfectly
set
forth
it
has
been
assailed
as
buddhistic
and
as
though
it
could
be
both
these
together
when
both
buddhism
and
christianity
as
set
forth
by
their
inspired
founders
make
brotherhood
the
one
essential
of
doctrine
and
of
life
theosophy
has
been
also
regarded
as
something
new
under
the
sun
or
at
best
as
old
mysticism
masquerading
under
a
new
name
while
it
is
true
that
many
societies
founded
upon
and
united
to
support
the
principles
of
altruism
or
essential
brotherhood
have
borne
various
names
it
is
also
true
that
many
have
also
been
called
theosophic
and
with
principles
and
aims
as
the
present
society
bearing
that
name
with
these
societies
one
and
all
the
essential
doctrine
has
been
the
same
and
all
else
has
been
incidental
though
this
does
not
obviate
the
fact
that
many
persons
are
attracted
to
the
incidentals
who
overlook
or
ignore
the
no
better
or
more
explicit
a
man
who
is
one
of
our
most
esteemed
and
earnest
be
given
to
your
questions
enq
which
system
do
you
prefer
or
follow
in
that
case
besides
buddhistic
ethics
theo
none
and
all
we
hold
to
no
religion
as
to
no
philosophy
in
particular
we
cull
the
good
we
find
in
each
but
here
again
it
must
be
stated
that
like
all
other
ancient
systems
theosophy
is
divided
into
exoteric
and
sections
enq
what
is
the
difference
theo
the
members
of
the
theosophical
society
at
large
are
free
to
profess
whatever
religion
or
philosophy
they
like
or
none
if
they
so
prefer
provided
they
are
in
sympathy
with
and
ready
to
carry
out
one
or
more
of
the
three
objects
of
the
association
the
society
is
a
philanthropic
and
scientific
body
for
the
propagation
of
the
idea
of
brotherhood
on
instead
of
lines
the
fellows
may
be
christians
or
mussulmen
jews
or
parsees
buddhists
or
brahmins
spiritualists
or
materialists
it
does
not
matter
but
every
member
must
be
either
a
philanthropist
or
a
scholar
a
searcher
into
aryan
and
other
old
literature
or
a
psychic
student
in
short
he
has
to
help
if
he
can
in
the
carrying
out
of
at
least
one
of
the
objects
of
the
programme
otherwise
he
has
no
reason
for
becoming
a
such
are
the
majority
of
the
exoteric
society
composed
of
and
members
these
may
or
may
not
become
theosophists
members
they
are
by
virtue
of
their
having
joined
the
society
but
the
latter
can
not
make
a
theosophist
of
one
who
has
no
sense
for
the
fitness
of
things
or
of
him
who
understands
theosophy
in
his
the
expression
may
be
and
egotistic
way
is
as
handsome
could
be
paraphrased
in
this
case
and
be
made
to
run
is
who
theosophy
theosophists
and
members
of
the
enq
this
applies
to
lay
members
as
i
understand
and
what
of
those
who
pursue
the
esoteric
study
of
theosophy
are
they
the
real
theosophists
theo
not
necessarily
until
they
have
proven
themselves
to
be
such
they
have
entered
the
inner
group
and
pledged
themselves
to
carry
out
as
strictly
as
they
can
the
rules
of
the
occult
body
this
is
a
difficult
undertaking
as
the
foremost
rule
of
all
is
the
entire
renunciation
of
a
member
has
to
become
a
thorough
altruist
never
to
think
of
himself
and
to
forget
his
own
vanity
and
pride
in
the
thought
of
the
good
of
his
besides
that
of
his
in
the
esoteric
circle
he
has
to
live
if
the
esoteric
instructions
shall
profit
him
a
life
of
abstinence
in
everything
of
and
strict
morality
doing
his
duty
by
all
men
the
few
real
theosophists
in
the
are
among
these
members
this
does
not
imply
that
outside
of
the
and
the
inner
circle
there
are
no
theosophists
for
there
are
and
more
than
people
know
of
certainly
far
more
than
are
found
among
the
lay
members
of
the
enq
then
what
is
the
good
of
joining
the
theosophical
society
in
that
case
where
is
the
incentive
theo
none
except
the
advantage
of
getting
esoteric
instructions
the
genuine
doctrines
of
the
and
if
the
real
programme
is
carried
out
deriving
much
help
from
mutual
aid
and
sympathy
union
is
strength
and
harmony
and
simultaneous
efforts
produce
wonders
this
has
been
the
secret
of
all
associations
and
communities
since
mankind
existed
enq
but
why
could
not
a
man
of
mind
and
singleness
of
purpose
one
say
of
indomitable
energy
and
perseverance
become
an
occultist
and
even
an
adept
if
he
works
alone
theo
he
may
but
there
are
ten
thousand
chances
against
one
that
he
will
fail
for
one
reason
out
of
many
others
no
books
on
occultism
or
theurgy
exist
in
our
day
which
give
out
the
secrets
of
alchemy
or
mediæval
theosophy
in
plain
language
all
are
symbolical
or
in
parables
and
as
the
key
to
these
has
been
lost
for
ages
in
the
west
how
can
a
man
learn
the
correct
meaning
of
what
he
is
reading
and
studying
therein
lies
the
greatest
danger
one
that
leads
to
unconscious
magic
or
the
most
helpless
mediumship
he
who
has
not
an
initiate
for
a
master
had
better
leave
the
dangerous
study
alone
look
around
you
and
observe
while
of
society
ridicule
the
mere
notion
that
there
is
anything
in
theosophy
occultism
spiritualism
or
in
the
kabala
the
other
third
is
composed
of
the
most
heterogeneous
and
opposite
elements
some
believe
in
the
mystical
and
even
in
the
but
each
believes
in
his
own
way
others
will
rush
into
the
study
of
the
kabala
psychism
mesmerism
spiritualism
or
some
form
or
another
of
mysticism
result
no
two
men
think
alike
no
two
are
agreed
upon
any
fundamental
occult
principles
though
many
are
those
who
claim
for
themselves
the
of
knowledge
and
would
make
outsiders
believe
that
they
are
adepts
not
only
is
there
no
scientific
and
accurate
knowledge
of
occultism
accessible
in
the
even
of
true
astrology
the
only
branch
of
occultism
which
in
its
teachings
has
definite
laws
and
a
definite
no
one
has
any
idea
of
what
real
occultism
means
some
limit
ancient
wisdom
to
the
and
the
jewish
which
each
interprets
in
his
own
way
according
to
the
of
the
rabbinical
methods
others
regard
swedenborg
or
boehme
as
the
ultimate
expressions
of
the
highest
wisdom
while
others
again
see
in
mesmerism
the
great
secret
of
ancient
magic
one
and
all
of
those
who
put
their
theory
into
practice
are
rapidly
drifting
through
ignorance
into
black
magic
happy
are
those
who
escape
from
it
as
they
have
neither
test
nor
criterion
by
which
they
can
distinguish
between
the
true
and
the
false
enq
are
we
to
understand
that
the
inner
group
of
the
claims
to
learn
what
it
does
from
real
initiates
or
masters
of
esoteric
wisdom
theo
not
directly
the
personal
presence
of
such
masters
is
not
required
suffice
it
if
they
give
instructions
to
some
of
those
who
have
studied
under
their
guidance
for
years
and
devoted
their
whole
lives
to
their
service
then
in
turn
these
can
give
out
the
knowledge
so
imparted
to
others
who
had
no
such
opportunity
a
portion
of
the
true
sciences
is
better
than
a
mass
of
undigested
and
misunderstood
learning
an
ounce
of
gold
is
worth
a
ton
of
dust
enq
but
how
is
one
to
know
whether
the
ounce
is
real
gold
or
only
a
counterfeit
theo
a
tree
is
known
by
its
fruit
a
system
by
its
results
when
our
opponents
are
able
to
prove
to
us
that
any
solitary
student
of
occultism
throughout
the
ages
has
become
a
saintly
adept
like
ammonius
saccas
or
even
a
plotinus
or
a
theurgist
like
iamblichus
or
achieved
feats
such
as
are
claimed
to
have
been
done
by
germain
without
any
master
to
guide
him
and
all
this
without
being
a
medium
a
psychic
or
a
shall
we
confess
ourselves
mistaken
but
till
then
theosophists
prefer
to
follow
the
proven
natural
law
of
the
tradition
of
the
sacred
science
there
are
mystics
who
have
made
great
discoveries
in
chemistry
and
physical
sciences
almost
bordering
on
alchemy
and
occultism
others
who
by
the
sole
aid
of
their
genius
have
rediscovered
portions
if
not
the
whole
of
the
lost
alphabets
of
the
language
and
are
therefore
able
to
read
correctly
hebrew
scrolls
others
still
who
being
seers
have
caught
wonderful
of
the
hidden
secrets
of
nature
but
all
these
are
one
is
a
theoretical
inventor
another
a
hebrew
a
sectarian
kabalist
a
third
a
swedenborg
of
modern
times
denying
all
and
everything
outside
of
his
own
particular
science
or
religion
not
one
of
them
can
boast
of
having
produced
a
universal
or
even
a
national
benefit
thereby
not
even
to
himself
with
the
exception
of
a
few
that
class
which
the
royal
college
of
physicians
and
surgeons
would
call
have
helped
with
their
science
humanity
nor
even
a
number
of
men
of
the
same
community
where
are
the
chaldees
of
old
those
who
wrought
marvellous
cures
by
charms
but
by
where
is
an
apollonius
of
tyana
who
healed
the
sick
and
raised
the
dead
under
any
climate
and
circumstances
we
know
some
of
the
former
class
in
europe
but
none
of
the
in
asia
where
the
secret
of
the
yogi
live
in
death
is
still
preserved
enq
is
the
production
of
such
healing
adepts
the
aim
of
theosophy
theo
its
aims
are
several
but
the
most
important
of
all
are
those
which
are
likely
to
lead
to
the
relief
of
human
suffering
under
any
or
every
form
moral
as
well
as
physical
and
we
believe
the
former
to
be
far
more
important
than
the
latter
theosophy
has
to
inculcate
ethics
it
has
to
purify
the
soul
if
it
would
relieve
the
physical
body
whose
ailments
save
cases
of
accidents
are
all
hereditary
it
is
not
by
studying
occultism
for
selfish
ends
for
the
gratification
of
personal
ambition
pride
or
vanity
that
one
can
ever
reach
the
true
goal
that
of
helping
suffering
mankind
nor
is
it
by
studying
one
single
branch
of
the
esoteric
philosophy
that
a
man
becomes
an
occultist
but
by
studying
if
not
mastering
them
all
enq
is
help
then
to
reach
this
most
important
aim
given
only
to
those
who
study
the
esoteric
sciences
theo
not
at
all
every
member
is
entitled
to
general
instruction
if
he
only
wants
it
but
few
are
willing
to
become
what
is
called
members
and
most
prefer
to
remain
the
of
theosophy
let
it
be
understood
that
private
research
is
encouraged
in
the
provided
it
does
not
infringe
the
limit
which
separates
the
exoteric
from
the
esoteric
the
from
the
magic
the
difference
between
theosophy
and
spiritualism
enq
you
speak
of
theosophy
and
occultism
are
they
identical
theo
by
no
means
a
man
may
be
a
very
good
theosophist
indeed
whether
or
of
the
society
without
being
in
any
way
an
occultist
but
no
one
can
be
a
true
occultist
without
being
a
real
theosophist
otherwise
he
is
simply
a
black
magician
whether
conscious
or
unconscious
enq
what
do
you
mean
theo
i
have
said
already
that
a
true
theosophist
must
put
in
practice
the
loftiest
moral
ideal
must
strive
to
realize
his
unity
with
the
whole
of
humanity
and
work
ceaselessly
for
others
now
if
an
occultist
does
not
do
all
this
he
must
act
selfishly
for
his
own
personal
benefit
and
if
he
has
acquired
more
practical
power
than
other
ordinary
men
he
becomes
forthwith
a
far
more
dangerous
enemy
to
the
world
and
those
around
him
than
the
average
mortal
this
is
clear
enq
then
is
an
occultist
simply
a
man
who
possesses
more
power
than
other
people
theo
far
he
is
a
and
really
learned
occultist
and
not
one
only
in
name
occult
sciences
are
as
described
in
encyclopædias
sciences
of
the
middle
ages
which
related
to
the
action
or
influence
of
occult
qualities
or
supernatural
powers
as
alchemy
magic
necromancy
and
astrology
for
they
are
real
actual
and
very
dangerous
sciences
they
teach
the
secret
potency
of
things
in
nature
developing
and
cultivating
the
hidden
powers
in
man
thus
giving
him
tremendous
advantages
over
more
ignorant
mortals
hypnotism
now
become
so
common
and
a
subject
of
serious
scientific
inquiry
is
a
good
instance
in
point
power
has
been
discovered
almost
by
accident
the
way
to
it
having
been
prepared
by
mesmerism
and
now
an
able
hypnotizer
can
do
almost
anything
with
it
from
forcing
a
man
unconsciously
to
himself
to
play
the
fool
to
making
him
commit
a
by
proxy
for
the
hypnotizer
and
the
benefit
of
the
is
not
this
a
terrible
power
if
left
in
the
hands
of
unscrupulous
persons
and
please
to
remember
that
this
is
only
one
of
the
minor
branches
of
occultism
enq
but
are
not
all
these
occult
sciences
magic
and
sorcery
considered
by
the
most
cultured
and
learned
people
as
relics
of
ancient
ignorance
and
superstition
theo
let
me
remind
you
that
this
remark
of
yours
cuts
both
ways
the
cultured
and
among
you
regard
also
christianity
and
every
other
religion
as
a
relic
of
ignorance
and
superstition
people
begin
to
believe
now
at
any
rate
in
and
of
the
theosophy
and
phenomena
but
who
among
them
except
preachers
and
blind
fanatics
will
confess
to
a
belief
in
and
this
is
where
the
point
of
difference
comes
in
there
are
very
good
and
pure
theosophists
who
may
believe
in
the
supernatural
divine
included
but
no
occultist
will
do
so
for
an
occultist
practices
theosophy
based
on
accurate
knowledge
of
secret
workings
but
a
theosophist
practising
the
powers
called
abnormal
the
light
of
occultism
will
simply
tend
toward
a
dangerous
form
of
mediumship
because
although
holding
to
theosophy
and
its
highest
conceivable
code
of
ethics
he
practises
it
in
the
dark
on
sincere
but
faith
anyone
theosophist
or
spiritualist
who
attempts
to
cultivate
one
of
the
branches
of
occult
hypnotism
mesmerism
or
even
the
secrets
of
producing
physical
phenomena
the
knowledge
of
the
philosophic
of
those
powers
is
like
a
rudderless
boat
launched
on
a
stormy
ocean
the
difference
between
theosophy
and
spiritualism
enq
but
do
you
not
believe
in
spiritualism
theo
if
by
you
mean
the
explanation
which
spiritualists
give
of
some
abnormal
phenomena
then
decidedly
do
they
maintain
that
these
manifestations
are
all
produced
by
the
of
departed
mortals
generally
their
relatives
who
return
to
earth
they
say
to
communicate
with
those
they
have
loved
or
to
whom
they
are
attached
we
deny
this
point
blank
we
assert
that
the
spirits
of
the
dead
can
not
return
to
in
rare
and
exceptional
cases
of
which
i
may
speak
later
nor
do
they
communicate
with
men
except
by
subjective
that
which
does
appear
objectively
is
only
the
phantom
of
the
man
but
in
and
so
to
say
spiritualism
we
do
believe
most
decidedly
enq
do
you
reject
the
phenomena
also
theo
assuredly
cases
of
conscious
fraud
enq
how
do
you
account
for
them
then
theo
in
many
ways
the
causes
of
such
manifestations
are
by
no
means
so
simple
as
the
spiritualists
would
like
to
believe
foremost
of
all
the
ex
of
the
is
usually
the
astral
body
or
of
the
medium
or
of
some
one
present
this
body
is
also
the
producer
or
operating
force
in
the
manifestations
of
manifestations
and
so
on
enq
you
say
then
is
it
that
produces
the
rest
theo
that
depends
on
the
nature
of
the
manifestations
sometimes
the
astral
remains
the
kamalokic
of
the
vanished
that
were
at
other
times
elementals
is
a
word
of
manifold
and
wide
significance
i
really
do
not
know
what
spiritualists
mean
by
the
term
but
what
we
understand
them
to
claim
is
that
the
physical
phenomena
are
produced
by
the
reincarnating
the
and
immortal
and
this
hypothesis
we
entirely
reject
the
conscious
of
the
disembodied
nor
can
it
return
from
its
own
mental
devachanic
sphere
to
the
plane
of
terrestrial
objectivity
enq
but
many
of
the
communications
received
from
the
show
not
only
intelligence
but
a
knowledge
of
facts
not
known
to
the
medium
and
sometimes
even
not
consciously
present
to
the
mind
of
the
investigator
or
any
of
those
who
compose
the
audience
theo
this
does
not
necessarily
prove
that
the
intelligence
and
knowledge
you
speak
of
belong
to
or
emanate
from
souls
somnambulists
have
been
known
to
compose
music
and
poetry
and
to
solve
mathematical
problems
while
in
their
trance
state
without
having
ever
learnt
music
or
mathematics
others
answered
intelligently
to
questions
put
to
them
and
even
in
several
cases
spoke
languages
such
as
hebrew
and
latin
of
which
they
were
entirely
ignorant
when
this
in
a
state
of
profound
sleep
will
you
then
maintain
that
this
was
caused
by
enq
but
how
would
you
explain
it
theo
we
assert
that
the
divine
spark
in
man
being
one
and
identical
in
its
essence
with
the
universal
spirit
our
is
practically
omniscient
but
that
it
can
not
manifest
its
knowledge
owing
to
the
impediments
of
matter
now
the
more
these
impediments
are
removed
in
other
words
the
more
the
physical
body
is
paralyzed
as
to
its
own
independent
activity
and
consciousness
as
in
deep
sleep
or
deep
trance
or
again
in
illness
the
more
fully
can
the
self
manifest
on
this
plane
this
is
our
explanation
of
those
truly
wonderful
phenomena
of
a
higher
order
in
which
undeniable
intelligence
and
knowledge
are
exhibited
as
to
the
lower
order
of
manifestations
such
as
physical
phenomena
and
the
platitudes
and
common
talk
of
the
general
to
explain
even
the
most
important
of
the
teachings
we
hold
upon
the
subject
would
take
up
more
space
and
time
than
can
be
allotted
to
it
at
present
we
have
no
desire
to
interfere
with
the
belief
of
the
spiritualists
any
more
than
with
any
other
belief
the
must
fall
on
the
believers
in
and
at
the
present
moment
while
still
convinced
that
the
higher
sort
of
manifestations
occur
through
the
disembodied
souls
their
leaders
and
the
most
learned
and
intelligent
among
the
spiritualists
are
the
first
to
confess
that
not
the
phenomena
are
produced
by
spirits
gradually
they
will
come
to
recognize
the
whole
truth
but
meanwhile
we
have
no
right
nor
desire
to
proselytize
them
to
our
views
the
less
so
as
in
the
cases
of
purely
and
spiritual
we
believe
in
the
intercommunication
of
the
spirit
of
the
living
man
with
that
of
disembodied
personalities
enq
this
means
that
you
reject
the
philosophy
of
spiritualism
theo
if
by
you
mean
their
crude
theories
we
do
but
they
have
no
philosophy
in
truth
their
best
their
most
intellectual
and
earnest
defenders
say
so
their
fundamental
and
only
unimpeachable
truth
namely
that
phenomena
occur
through
mediums
controlled
by
invisible
forces
and
one
except
a
blind
materialist
of
the
big
school
will
or
deny
with
regard
to
their
philosophy
however
let
me
read
to
you
what
the
able
editor
of
than
whom
the
spiritualists
will
find
no
wiser
nor
more
devoted
champion
says
of
them
and
their
philosophy
this
is
what
oxon
one
of
the
very
few
spiritualists
writes
with
respect
to
their
lack
of
organization
and
blind
bigotry
it
is
worth
while
to
look
steadily
at
this
point
for
it
is
of
vital
moment
we
have
an
experience
and
a
knowledge
beside
which
all
other
knowledge
is
comparatively
insignificant
the
ordinary
spiritualist
waxes
wroth
if
anyone
ventures
to
impugn
his
assured
knowledge
of
the
future
and
his
absolute
certainty
of
the
life
to
come
where
other
men
have
stretched
forth
feeble
hands
groping
into
the
dark
future
he
walks
boldly
as
one
who
has
a
chart
and
knows
his
way
where
other
men
have
stopped
short
at
a
pious
aspiration
or
have
been
content
with
a
hereditary
faith
it
is
his
boast
that
he
knows
what
they
only
believe
and
that
out
of
his
rich
stores
he
can
supplement
the
fading
faiths
built
only
upon
hope
he
is
magnificent
in
his
dealings
with
most
cherished
expectations
hope
he
seems
to
say
that
which
i
can
demonstrate
you
have
accepted
a
traditional
belief
in
what
i
can
experimentally
prove
according
to
the
strictest
scientific
method
the
old
beliefs
are
fading
come
out
from
them
and
be
separate
they
contain
as
much
falsehood
as
truth
only
by
building
on
a
sure
foundation
of
demonstrated
fact
can
your
superstructure
be
stable
all
round
you
old
faiths
are
toppling
avoid
the
crash
and
get
you
when
one
comes
to
deal
with
this
magnificent
person
in
a
practical
way
what
is
the
result
very
curious
and
very
disappointing
he
is
so
sure
of
his
ground
that
he
takes
no
trouble
to
ascertain
the
interpretation
which
others
put
upon
his
facts
the
wisdom
of
the
ages
has
concerned
itself
with
the
explanation
of
what
he
rightly
regards
as
proven
but
he
does
not
turn
a
passing
glance
on
its
researches
he
does
not
even
agree
altogether
with
his
brother
spiritualist
it
is
the
story
over
again
of
the
old
scotch
body
who
together
with
her
husband
formed
a
they
had
exclusive
keys
to
heaven
or
rather
she
had
for
she
was
certain
aboot
so
the
infinitely
divided
and
subdivided
and
resubdivided
sects
of
spiritualists
shake
their
heads
and
are
certain
one
another
again
the
collective
experience
of
mankind
is
solid
and
unvarying
on
this
point
that
union
is
strength
and
disunion
a
source
of
weakness
and
failure
shoulder
to
shoulder
drilled
and
disciplined
a
rabble
becomes
an
army
each
man
a
match
for
a
hundred
of
the
untrained
men
that
may
be
brought
against
it
organization
in
every
department
of
work
means
success
saving
of
time
and
labour
profit
and
development
want
of
method
want
of
plan
haphazard
work
fitful
energy
undisciplined
mean
bungling
failure
the
voice
of
humanity
attests
the
truth
does
the
spiritualist
accept
the
verdict
and
act
on
the
conclusion
verily
no
he
refuses
to
organize
he
is
a
law
unto
himself
and
a
thorn
in
the
side
of
his
june
enq
i
was
told
that
the
theosophical
society
was
originally
founded
to
crush
spiritualism
and
belief
in
the
survival
of
the
individuality
in
man
theo
you
are
misinformed
our
beliefs
are
all
founded
on
that
immortal
individuality
but
then
like
so
many
others
you
confuse
with
individuality
your
western
psychologists
do
not
seem
to
have
established
any
clear
distinction
between
the
two
yet
it
is
precisely
that
difference
which
gives
the
to
the
understanding
of
eastern
philosophy
and
which
lies
at
the
root
of
the
divergence
between
the
theosophical
and
spiritualistic
teachings
and
though
it
may
draw
upon
us
still
more
the
hostility
of
some
spiritualists
yet
i
must
state
here
that
it
is
theosophy
which
is
the
and
unalloyed
spiritualism
while
the
modern
scheme
of
that
name
is
as
now
practised
by
the
masses
simply
transcendental
materialism
enq
please
explain
your
idea
more
clearly
theo
what
i
mean
is
that
though
our
teachings
insist
upon
the
identity
of
spirit
and
matter
and
though
we
say
that
spirit
is
matter
and
matter
simply
crystallized
spirit
as
ice
is
solidified
steam
yet
since
the
original
and
eternal
condition
of
is
not
spirit
but
so
to
speak
visible
and
solid
matter
being
simply
its
periodical
manifestation
we
maintain
that
the
term
spirit
can
only
be
applied
to
the
individuality
enq
but
what
is
the
distinction
between
this
and
the
or
of
which
we
are
all
conscious
theo
before
i
can
answer
you
we
must
argue
upon
what
you
mean
by
or
we
distinguish
between
the
simple
fact
of
the
simple
feeling
that
am
i
and
the
complex
thought
that
am
or
believing
as
we
do
in
a
series
of
births
for
the
same
ego
or
this
distinction
is
the
fundamental
pivot
of
the
whole
idea
you
see
really
means
a
long
series
of
daily
experiences
strung
together
by
the
thread
of
memory
and
forming
what
smith
calls
but
none
of
these
are
really
the
or
the
ego
nor
do
they
give
the
feeling
that
he
is
himself
for
he
forgets
the
greater
part
of
his
daily
experiences
and
they
produce
the
feeling
of
in
him
only
while
they
last
we
theosophists
therefore
distinguish
between
this
bundle
of
which
we
call
the
because
so
finite
and
evanescent
and
that
element
in
man
to
which
the
feeling
of
am
is
due
it
is
this
am
which
we
call
the
individuality
and
we
say
that
this
or
individuality
plays
like
an
actor
many
parts
on
the
stage
of
life
let
us
call
every
new
life
on
earth
of
the
same
a
on
the
stage
of
a
theatre
one
night
the
actor
or
appears
as
the
next
as
the
third
as
the
fourth
as
or
lear
and
so
on
until
he
has
run
through
the
whole
cycle
of
incarnations
the
ego
begins
his
as
a
sprite
an
or
a
he
plays
the
part
of
a
is
a
soldier
a
servant
one
of
the
chorus
rises
then
to
parts
plays
leading
interspersed
with
insignificant
parts
till
he
finally
retires
from
the
stage
as
the
enq
i
understand
you
say
then
that
this
true
can
not
return
to
earth
after
death
but
surely
the
actor
is
at
liberty
if
he
has
preserved
the
sense
of
his
individuality
to
return
if
he
likes
to
the
scene
of
his
former
actions
theo
we
say
not
simply
because
such
a
return
to
earth
would
be
incompatible
with
any
state
of
bliss
after
death
as
i
am
prepared
to
prove
we
say
that
man
suffers
so
much
unmerited
misery
during
his
life
through
the
fault
of
others
with
whom
he
is
associated
or
because
of
his
environment
that
he
is
surely
entitled
to
perfect
rest
and
quiet
if
not
bliss
before
taking
up
again
the
burden
of
life
however
we
can
discuss
this
in
detail
later
why
is
theosophy
accepted
enq
i
understand
to
a
certain
extent
but
i
see
that
your
teachings
are
far
more
complicated
and
metaphysical
than
either
spiritualism
or
current
religious
thought
can
you
tell
me
then
what
has
caused
this
system
of
theosophy
which
you
support
to
arouse
so
much
interest
and
so
much
animosity
at
the
same
time
theo
there
are
several
reasons
for
it
i
believe
among
other
causes
that
may
be
mentioned
is
the
great
reaction
from
the
crassly
materialistic
theories
now
prevalent
among
scientific
teachers
general
dissatisfaction
with
the
artificial
theology
of
the
various
christian
churches
and
the
number
of
daily
increasing
and
conflicting
sects
an
perception
of
the
fact
that
the
creeds
which
are
so
obviously
be
and
that
claims
which
are
unverified
be
this
natural
distrust
of
conventional
religions
is
only
strengthened
by
their
complete
failure
to
preserve
morals
and
to
purify
society
and
the
masses
a
conviction
on
the
part
of
many
and
by
a
few
that
there
must
be
somewhere
a
philosophical
and
religious
system
which
shall
be
scientific
and
not
merely
speculative
a
belief
perhaps
that
such
a
system
must
be
sought
for
in
teachings
far
antedating
any
modern
faith
enq
but
how
did
this
system
come
to
be
put
forward
just
now
theo
just
because
the
time
was
found
to
be
ripe
which
fact
is
shown
by
the
determined
effort
of
so
many
earnest
students
to
reach
at
whatever
cost
and
wherever
it
may
be
concealed
seeing
this
its
custodians
permitted
that
some
portions
at
least
of
that
truth
should
be
proclaimed
had
the
formation
of
the
theosophical
society
been
postponed
a
few
years
longer
one
half
of
the
civilized
nations
would
have
become
by
this
time
rank
materialists
and
the
other
half
anthropomorphists
and
phenomenalists
enq
are
we
to
regard
theosophy
in
any
way
as
a
revelation
theo
in
no
way
even
in
the
sense
of
a
new
and
direct
disclosure
from
some
higher
supernatural
or
at
least
but
only
in
the
sense
of
an
of
old
very
old
truths
to
minds
hitherto
ignorant
of
them
ignorant
even
of
the
existence
and
preservation
of
any
such
archaic
knowledge
enq
you
spoke
of
if
truth
is
as
represented
by
theosophy
why
has
it
met
with
such
opposition
and
with
no
general
acceptance
theo
for
many
and
various
reasons
again
one
of
which
is
the
hatred
felt
by
men
for
as
they
call
them
selfishness
is
essentially
conservative
and
hates
being
disturbed
it
prefers
an
unexacting
to
the
greatest
truth
if
the
latter
requires
the
sacrifice
of
smallest
comfort
the
power
of
mental
inertia
is
great
in
anything
that
does
not
promise
immediate
benefit
and
reward
our
age
is
unspiritual
and
matter
of
fact
moreover
there
is
the
unfamiliar
character
of
theosophic
teachings
the
highly
abstruse
nature
of
the
doctrines
some
of
which
contradict
flatly
many
of
the
human
vagaries
cherished
by
sectarians
which
have
eaten
into
the
very
core
of
popular
beliefs
if
we
add
to
this
the
personal
efforts
and
great
purity
of
life
exacted
of
those
who
would
become
the
disciples
of
the
circle
and
the
very
limited
class
to
which
an
entirely
unselfish
code
appeals
it
will
be
easy
to
perceive
the
reason
why
theosophy
is
doomed
to
such
slow
uphill
work
it
is
essentially
the
philosophy
of
those
who
suffer
and
have
lost
all
hope
of
being
helped
out
of
the
mire
of
life
by
any
other
means
moreover
the
history
of
any
system
of
belief
or
morals
newly
introduced
into
a
foreign
soil
shows
that
its
beginnings
were
impeded
by
every
obstacle
that
obscurantism
and
selfishness
could
suggest
crown
of
the
innovator
is
a
crown
of
indeed
no
pulling
down
of
old
buildings
can
be
accomplished
without
some
danger
enq
all
this
refers
rather
to
the
ethics
and
philosophy
of
the
can
you
give
me
a
general
idea
of
the
society
itself
its
object
and
statutes
theo
this
was
never
made
secret
ask
and
you
shall
receive
accurate
answers
enq
but
i
heard
that
you
were
bound
by
pledges
theo
only
in
the
or
section
enq
and
also
that
some
members
after
leaving
did
not
regard
themselves
bound
by
them
are
they
right
theo
this
shows
that
their
idea
of
honour
is
an
imperfect
one
how
can
they
be
right
as
well
said
in
the
our
theosophical
organ
at
new
york
treating
of
such
a
case
that
a
soldier
is
tried
for
infringement
of
oath
and
discipline
and
is
dismissed
from
the
service
in
his
rage
at
the
justice
he
has
called
down
and
of
whose
penalties
he
was
distinctly
forewarned
the
soldier
turns
to
the
enemy
with
false
information
spy
and
a
revenge
upon
his
former
chief
and
claims
that
his
punishment
has
released
him
from
his
oath
of
loyalty
to
a
is
he
justified
think
you
you
think
he
deserves
being
called
a
dishonourable
man
a
coward
enq
i
believe
so
but
some
think
otherwise
theo
so
much
the
worse
for
them
but
we
will
talk
on
this
subject
later
if
you
please
footnotes
an
means
one
who
has
joined
some
particular
branch
of
the
an
one
who
belongs
to
the
society
at
large
has
his
diploma
from
the
headquarters
adyar
madras
but
is
connected
with
no
branch
or
lodge
we
say
that
in
such
cases
it
is
not
the
of
the
dead
who
on
earth
but
the
spirits
of
the
living
that
to
the
pure
spiritual
souls
in
truth
there
is
neither
nor
but
a
change
of
or
for
the
medium
the
body
of
the
latter
becoming
paralyzed
or
the
spiritual
ego
is
free
from
its
trammels
and
finds
itself
on
the
same
plane
of
consciousness
with
the
disembodied
spirits
hence
if
there
is
any
spiritual
attraction
between
the
two
can
as
often
occurs
in
dreams
the
difference
between
a
mediumistic
and
a
nature
is
this
the
liberated
spirit
of
a
medium
has
the
opportunity
and
facility
of
influencing
the
passive
organs
of
its
entranced
physical
body
to
make
them
act
speak
and
write
at
its
will
the
ego
can
make
it
repeat
and
in
the
human
language
the
thoughts
and
ideas
of
the
disembodied
entity
as
well
as
its
own
but
the
or
organism
of
one
who
is
very
positive
can
not
be
so
influenced
hence
although
there
is
hardly
a
human
being
whose
ego
does
not
hold
free
intercourse
during
the
sleep
of
his
body
with
those
whom
it
loved
and
lost
yet
on
account
of
the
positiveness
and
of
its
physical
envelope
and
brain
no
recollection
or
a
very
dim
remembrance
lingers
in
the
memory
of
the
person
once
awake
individuality
and
it
has
become
especially
of
late
to
deride
the
notion
that
there
ever
was
in
the
of
great
and
civilized
peoples
such
as
the
egyptians
greeks
or
romans
anything
but
priestly
imposture
even
the
rosicrucians
were
no
better
than
half
lunatics
half
knaves
numerous
books
have
been
written
on
them
and
tyros
who
had
hardly
heard
the
name
a
few
years
before
sallied
out
as
profound
critics
and
gnostics
on
the
subject
of
alchemy
the
and
mysticism
in
general
yet
a
long
series
of
the
hierophants
of
egypt
india
chaldea
and
arabia
are
known
along
with
the
greatest
philosophers
and
sages
of
greece
and
the
west
to
have
included
under
the
designation
of
wisdom
and
divine
science
all
knowledge
for
they
considered
the
base
and
origin
of
every
art
and
science
as
divine
plato
regarded
the
as
most
sacred
and
clemens
alexandrinus
who
had
been
himself
initiated
into
the
eleusinian
mysteries
has
declared
the
doctrines
taught
therein
contained
in
them
the
end
of
all
human
were
plato
and
clemens
two
knaves
or
two
fools
we
wonder
iii
the
working
system
of
the
the
objects
of
the
society
enq
what
are
the
objects
of
the
theo
they
are
three
and
have
been
so
from
the
beginning
to
form
the
nucleus
of
a
universal
brotherhood
of
humanity
without
distinction
of
race
colour
or
creed
to
promote
the
study
of
aryan
and
other
scriptures
of
the
religion
and
sciences
and
to
vindicate
the
importance
of
old
asiatic
literature
namely
of
the
brahmanical
buddhist
and
zoroastrian
philosophies
to
investigate
the
hidden
mysteries
of
nature
under
every
aspect
possible
and
the
psychic
and
spiritual
powers
latent
in
man
especially
these
are
broadly
stated
the
three
chief
objects
of
the
theosophical
society
enq
can
you
give
me
some
more
detailed
information
upon
these
theo
we
may
divide
each
of
the
three
objects
into
as
many
explanatory
clauses
as
may
be
found
necessary
enq
then
let
us
begin
with
the
first
what
means
would
you
resort
to
in
order
to
promote
such
a
feeling
of
brotherhood
among
races
that
are
known
to
be
of
the
most
diversified
religions
customs
beliefs
and
modes
of
thought
theo
allow
me
to
add
that
which
you
seem
unwilling
to
express
of
course
we
know
that
with
the
exception
of
two
remnants
of
parsees
and
the
nation
is
divided
not
merely
against
all
other
nations
but
even
against
itself
this
is
found
most
prominently
among
the
civilized
christian
nations
hence
your
wonder
and
the
reason
why
our
first
object
appears
to
you
a
utopia
is
it
not
so
enq
well
yes
but
what
have
you
to
say
against
it
theo
nothing
against
the
fact
but
much
about
the
necessity
of
removing
the
causes
which
make
universal
brotherhood
a
utopia
at
present
enq
what
are
in
your
view
these
causes
theo
first
and
foremost
the
natural
selfishness
of
human
nature
this
selfishness
instead
of
being
eradicated
is
daily
strengthened
and
stimulated
into
a
ferocious
and
irresistible
feeling
by
the
present
religious
education
which
tends
not
only
to
encourage
but
positively
to
justify
it
ideas
about
right
and
wrong
have
been
entirely
perverted
by
the
literal
acceptance
of
the
jewish
bible
all
the
unselfishness
of
the
altruistic
teachings
of
jesus
has
become
merely
a
theoretical
subject
for
pulpit
oratory
while
the
precepts
of
practical
selfishness
taught
in
the
mosaic
bible
against
which
christ
so
vainly
preached
have
become
ingrained
into
the
innermost
life
of
the
western
nations
eye
for
an
eye
and
a
tooth
for
a
has
come
to
be
the
first
maxim
of
your
law
now
i
state
openly
and
fearlessly
that
the
perversity
of
this
doctrine
and
of
so
many
others
can
eradicate
the
common
origin
of
man
enq
how
theo
simply
by
demonstrating
on
logical
philosophical
metaphysical
and
even
scientific
grounds
that
a
all
men
have
spiritually
and
physically
the
same
origin
which
is
the
fundamental
teaching
of
theosophy
b
as
mankind
is
essentially
of
one
and
the
same
essence
and
that
essence
is
uncreate
and
eternal
whether
we
call
it
god
or
therefore
can
affect
one
nation
or
one
man
without
affecting
all
other
nations
and
all
other
men
this
is
as
certain
and
as
obvious
as
that
a
stone
thrown
into
a
pond
will
sooner
or
later
set
in
motion
every
single
drop
of
water
therein
enq
but
this
is
not
the
teaching
of
christ
but
rather
a
pantheistic
notion
theo
that
is
where
your
mistake
lies
it
is
purely
although
judaic
and
therefore
perhaps
your
biblical
nations
prefer
to
ignore
it
enq
this
is
a
wholesale
and
unjust
accusation
where
are
your
proofs
for
such
a
statement
theo
they
are
ready
at
hand
christ
is
alleged
to
have
said
each
and
your
for
ye
love
them
only
which
love
you
what
reward
or
merit
have
ye
do
not
even
the
the
same
and
if
you
salute
your
brethren
only
what
do
ye
more
than
others
do
not
even
publicans
so
these
are
words
but
genesis
ix
says
be
canaan
a
servant
of
servants
shall
he
be
unto
his
and
therefore
christian
but
biblical
people
prefer
the
law
of
moses
to
law
of
love
they
base
upon
the
old
testament
which
panders
to
all
their
passions
their
laws
of
conquest
annexation
and
tyranny
over
races
which
they
call
what
crimes
have
been
committed
on
the
strength
of
this
infernal
if
taken
in
its
dead
letter
passage
in
genesis
history
alone
gives
us
an
idea
however
inadequate
enq
i
have
heard
you
say
that
the
identity
of
our
physical
origin
is
proved
by
science
that
of
our
spiritual
origin
by
the
yet
we
do
not
find
darwinists
exhibiting
great
fraternal
affection
theo
just
so
this
is
what
shows
the
deficiency
of
the
materialistic
systems
and
proves
that
we
theosophists
are
in
the
right
the
identity
of
our
physical
origin
makes
no
appeal
to
our
higher
and
deeper
feelings
matter
deprived
of
its
soul
and
spirit
or
its
divine
essence
can
not
speak
to
the
human
heart
but
the
identity
of
the
soul
and
spirit
of
real
immortal
man
as
theosophy
teaches
us
once
proven
and
in
our
hearts
would
lead
us
far
on
the
road
of
real
charity
and
brotherly
goodwill
enq
but
how
does
theosophy
explain
the
common
origin
of
man
theo
by
teaching
that
the
of
all
nature
objective
and
subjective
and
everything
else
in
the
universe
visible
and
invisible
and
will
one
absolute
essence
from
which
all
starts
and
into
which
everything
returns
this
is
aryan
philosophy
fully
represented
only
by
the
vedantins
and
the
buddhist
system
with
this
object
in
view
it
is
the
duty
of
all
theosophists
to
promote
in
every
practical
way
and
in
all
countries
the
spread
of
education
enq
what
do
the
written
statutes
of
your
society
advise
its
members
to
do
besides
this
on
the
physical
plane
i
mean
theo
in
order
to
awaken
brotherly
feeling
among
nations
we
have
to
assist
in
the
international
exchange
of
useful
arts
and
products
by
advice
information
and
with
all
worthy
individuals
and
associations
provided
however
add
the
statutes
no
benefit
or
percentage
shall
be
taken
by
the
society
or
the
for
its
or
their
corporate
for
instance
to
take
a
practical
illustration
the
organization
of
society
depicted
by
edward
bellamy
in
his
magnificent
work
backwards
admirably
represents
the
theosophical
idea
of
what
should
be
the
first
great
step
towards
the
full
realization
of
universal
brotherhood
the
state
of
things
he
depicts
falls
short
of
perfection
because
selfishness
still
exists
and
operates
in
the
hearts
of
men
but
in
the
main
selfishness
and
individualism
have
been
overcome
by
the
feeling
of
solidarity
and
mutual
brotherhood
and
the
scheme
of
life
there
described
reduces
the
causes
tending
to
create
and
foster
selfishness
to
a
minimum
enq
then
as
a
theosophist
you
will
take
part
in
an
effort
to
realize
such
an
ideal
theo
certainly
and
we
have
proved
it
by
action
have
not
you
heard
of
the
nationalist
clubs
and
party
which
have
sprung
up
in
america
since
the
publication
of
book
they
are
now
coming
prominently
to
the
front
and
will
do
so
more
and
more
as
time
goes
on
well
these
clubs
and
this
party
were
started
in
the
first
instance
by
theosophists
one
of
the
first
the
nationalist
club
of
boston
has
theosophists
for
president
and
secretary
and
the
majority
of
its
executive
belong
to
the
in
the
constitution
of
all
their
clubs
and
of
the
party
they
are
forming
the
influence
of
theosophy
and
of
the
society
is
plain
for
they
all
take
as
their
basis
their
first
and
fundamental
principle
the
brotherhood
of
humanity
as
taught
by
theosophy
in
their
declaration
of
principles
they
state
principle
of
the
brotherhood
of
humanity
is
one
of
the
eternal
truths
that
govern
the
progress
on
lines
which
distinguish
human
nature
from
brute
what
can
be
more
theosophical
than
this
but
it
is
not
enough
what
is
also
needed
is
to
impress
men
with
the
idea
that
if
the
root
of
mankind
is
then
there
must
also
be
one
truth
which
finds
expression
in
all
the
various
in
the
jewish
as
you
do
not
find
it
even
in
the
kabala
enq
this
refers
to
the
common
origin
of
religions
and
you
may
be
right
there
but
how
does
it
apply
to
practical
brotherhood
on
the
physical
plane
theo
first
because
that
which
is
true
on
the
metaphysical
plane
must
be
also
true
on
the
physical
secondly
because
there
is
no
more
fertile
source
of
hatred
and
strife
than
religious
differences
when
one
party
or
another
thinks
himself
the
sole
possessor
of
absolute
truth
it
becomes
only
natural
that
he
should
think
his
neighbour
absolutely
in
the
clutches
of
error
or
the
devil
but
once
get
a
man
to
see
that
none
of
them
has
the
truth
but
that
they
are
mutually
complementary
that
the
complete
truth
can
be
found
only
in
the
combined
views
of
all
after
that
which
is
false
in
each
of
them
has
been
sifted
true
brotherhood
in
religion
will
be
established
the
same
applies
in
the
physical
world
enq
please
explain
further
theo
take
an
instance
a
plant
consists
of
a
root
a
stem
and
many
shoots
and
leaves
as
humanity
as
a
whole
is
the
stem
which
grows
from
the
spiritual
root
so
is
the
stem
the
unity
of
the
plant
hurt
the
stem
and
it
is
obvious
that
every
shoot
and
leaf
will
suffer
so
it
is
with
mankind
enq
yes
but
if
you
injure
a
leaf
or
a
shoot
you
do
not
injure
the
whole
plant
theo
and
therefore
you
think
that
by
injuring
man
you
do
not
injure
humanity
but
how
do
know
are
you
aware
that
even
materialistic
science
teaches
that
any
injury
however
slight
to
a
plant
will
affect
the
whole
course
of
its
future
growth
and
development
therefore
you
are
mistaken
and
the
analogy
is
perfect
if
however
you
overlook
the
fact
that
a
cut
in
the
finger
may
often
make
the
whole
body
suffer
and
react
on
the
whole
nervous
system
i
must
all
the
more
remind
you
that
there
may
well
be
other
spiritual
laws
operating
on
plants
and
animals
as
well
as
on
mankind
although
as
you
do
not
recognize
their
action
on
plants
and
animals
you
may
deny
their
existence
enq
what
laws
do
you
mean
theo
we
call
them
karmic
laws
but
you
will
not
understand
the
full
meaning
of
the
term
unless
you
study
occultism
however
my
argument
did
not
rest
on
the
assumption
of
these
laws
but
really
on
the
analogy
of
the
plant
expand
the
idea
carry
it
out
to
a
universal
application
and
you
will
soon
find
that
in
true
philosophy
every
physical
action
has
its
moral
and
everlasting
effect
hurt
a
man
by
doing
him
bodily
harm
you
may
think
that
his
pain
and
suffering
can
not
spread
by
any
means
to
his
neighbours
least
of
all
to
men
of
other
nations
we
affirm
it
will
in
good
therefore
we
say
that
unless
every
man
is
brought
to
understand
and
accept
an
axiomatic
that
by
wronging
one
man
we
wrong
not
only
ourselves
but
the
whole
of
humanity
in
the
long
run
no
brotherly
feelings
such
as
preached
by
all
the
great
reformers
by
buddha
and
jesus
are
possible
on
earth
our
other
objects
enq
will
you
now
explain
the
methods
by
which
you
propose
to
carry
out
the
second
object
theo
to
collect
for
the
library
at
our
headquarters
of
adyar
madras
and
by
the
fellows
of
their
branches
for
their
local
libraries
all
the
good
works
upon
the
religions
that
we
can
to
put
into
written
form
correct
information
upon
the
various
ancient
philosophies
traditions
and
legends
and
disseminate
the
same
in
such
practicable
ways
as
the
translation
and
publication
of
original
works
of
value
and
extracts
from
and
commentaries
upon
the
same
or
the
oral
instructions
of
persons
learned
in
their
respective
departments
enq
and
what
about
the
third
object
to
develop
in
man
his
latent
spiritual
or
psychic
powers
theo
this
has
to
be
achieved
also
by
means
of
publications
in
those
places
where
no
lectures
and
personal
teachings
are
possible
our
duty
is
to
keep
alive
in
man
his
spiritual
intuitions
to
oppose
and
due
investigation
and
proof
of
its
irrational
in
every
form
religious
scientific
or
social
and
above
all
whether
as
religious
sectarianism
or
as
belief
in
miracles
or
anything
supernatural
what
we
have
to
do
is
to
seek
to
obtain
of
all
the
laws
of
nature
and
to
diffuse
it
to
encourage
the
study
of
those
laws
least
understood
by
modern
people
the
occult
sciences
on
the
true
knowledge
of
instead
of
as
at
present
on
beliefs
based
on
blind
faith
and
popular
and
traditions
however
fanciful
at
times
when
sifted
may
lead
to
the
discovery
of
but
important
secrets
of
nature
the
society
therefore
aims
at
pursuing
this
line
of
inquiry
in
the
hope
of
widening
the
field
of
scientific
and
philosophical
observation
on
the
sacredness
of
the
pledge
enq
have
you
any
ethical
system
that
you
carry
out
in
the
society
theo
the
ethics
are
there
ready
and
clear
enough
for
whomsoever
follow
them
they
are
the
essence
and
cream
of
the
ethics
gathered
from
the
teachings
of
all
the
great
reformers
therefore
you
will
find
represented
therein
confucius
and
zoroaster
and
the
the
precepts
of
gautama
buddha
and
jesus
of
nazareth
of
hillel
and
his
school
as
of
pythagoras
socrates
plato
and
their
schools
enq
do
the
members
of
your
society
carry
out
these
precepts
i
have
heard
of
great
dissensions
and
quarrels
among
them
theo
very
naturally
since
although
the
reform
in
its
present
shape
may
be
called
new
the
men
and
women
to
be
reformed
are
the
same
human
sinning
natures
as
of
old
as
already
said
the
earnest
members
are
few
but
many
are
the
sincere
and
persons
who
try
their
best
to
live
up
to
the
and
their
own
ideals
our
duty
is
to
encourage
and
assist
individual
fellows
in
intellectual
moral
and
spiritual
not
to
blame
or
condemn
those
who
fail
we
have
strictly
speaking
no
right
to
refuse
admission
to
in
the
of
the
society
wherein
who
enters
is
as
one
newly
but
if
any
member
his
sacred
pledges
on
his
word
of
honour
and
immortal
notwithstanding
chooses
to
continue
after
that
birth
with
the
new
man
the
vices
or
defects
of
his
old
life
and
to
indulge
in
them
still
in
the
society
then
of
course
he
is
more
than
likely
to
be
asked
to
resign
and
withdraw
or
in
case
of
his
refusal
to
be
expelled
we
have
the
strictest
rules
for
such
emergencies
enq
can
some
of
them
be
mentioned
theo
they
can
to
begin
with
no
fellow
in
the
society
whether
exoteric
or
esoteric
has
a
right
to
force
his
personal
opinions
upon
another
fellow
is
not
lawful
for
officer
of
the
parent
to
express
in
public
by
word
or
act
any
hostility
to
or
preference
for
any
one
section
religious
or
philosophical
more
than
another
all
have
an
equal
right
to
have
the
essential
features
of
their
religious
belief
laid
before
the
tribunal
of
an
impartial
world
and
no
officer
of
the
society
in
his
capacity
as
an
officer
has
the
right
to
preach
his
own
sectarian
views
and
beliefs
to
members
assembled
except
when
the
meeting
consists
of
his
after
due
warning
violation
of
this
rule
shall
be
punished
by
suspension
or
this
is
one
of
the
offenses
in
the
society
at
large
as
regards
the
inner
section
now
called
the
the
following
rules
have
been
laid
down
and
adopted
so
far
back
as
fellow
shall
put
to
his
selfish
use
any
knowledge
communicated
to
him
by
any
member
of
the
first
section
now
a
higher
violation
of
the
rule
being
punished
by
now
however
before
any
such
knowledge
can
be
imparted
the
applicant
has
to
bind
himself
by
a
solemn
oath
not
to
use
it
for
selfish
purposes
nor
to
reveal
anything
said
except
by
permission
enq
but
is
a
man
expelled
or
resigning
from
the
section
free
to
reveal
anything
he
may
have
learned
or
to
break
any
clause
of
the
pledge
he
has
taken
theo
certainly
not
his
expulsion
or
resignation
only
relieves
him
from
the
obligation
of
obedience
to
the
teacher
and
from
that
of
taking
an
active
part
in
the
work
of
the
society
but
surely
not
from
the
sacred
pledge
of
secrecy
enq
but
is
this
reasonable
and
just
theo
most
assuredly
to
any
man
or
woman
with
the
slightest
honourable
feeling
a
pledge
of
secrecy
taken
even
on
of
much
more
to
higher
god
binding
till
death
and
though
he
may
leave
the
section
and
the
society
no
man
or
woman
of
honour
will
think
of
attacking
or
injuring
a
body
to
which
he
or
she
has
been
so
pledged
enq
but
is
not
this
going
rather
far
theo
perhaps
so
according
to
the
low
standard
of
the
present
time
and
morality
but
if
it
does
not
bind
as
far
as
this
what
use
is
a
at
all
how
can
anyone
expect
to
be
taught
secret
knowledge
if
he
is
to
be
at
liberty
to
free
himself
from
all
the
obligations
he
had
taken
whenever
he
pleases
what
security
confidence
or
trust
would
ever
exist
among
them
if
pledges
such
as
this
were
to
have
no
really
binding
force
at
all
believe
me
the
law
of
retribution
karma
would
very
soon
overtake
one
who
so
broke
his
pledge
and
perhaps
as
soon
as
the
contempt
of
every
honourable
man
would
even
on
this
physical
plane
as
well
expressed
in
the
y
just
cited
on
this
subject
pledge
once
taken
is
for
ever
binding
in
both
the
moral
and
the
occult
if
we
break
it
once
and
are
punished
that
does
not
justify
us
in
breaking
it
again
and
so
long
as
we
do
so
long
will
the
mighty
lever
of
the
law
of
karma
react
upon

in
those
days
among
the
jews
the

profession
of
a
publican
was
the
most
odious
thing
in
the
world
they
were
not
allowed
to
enter
the

matthew
xviii
speaks
of
a

and
a

as
identical
yet
they
were
only

occupying
the
same
position
as
the
british
officials
in

and
other
conquered
countries
the
close
of
the
middle
ages
slavery
under
the
power
of
moral
forces
had
mainly
disappeared
from
europe
but
two
momentous
events
occurred
which
overbore
the
moral
power
working
in
european
society
and
let
loose
a
swarm
of
curses
upon
the
earth
such
as
mankind
had
scarcely
ever
known
one
of
these
events
was
the
first
voyaging
to
a
populated
and
barbarous
coast
where
human
beings
were
a
familiar
article
of
traffic
and
the
other
the
discovery
of
a
new
world
where
mines
of
glittering
wealth
were
open
provided
labour
could
be
imported
to
work
them
for
four
hundred
years
men
and
women
and
children
were
torn
from
all
whom
they
knew
and
loved
and
were
sold
on
the
coast
of
africa
to
foreign
traders
they
were
chained
below
dead
often
with
the
the
horrible
passage
and
according
to
bancroft
an
impartial
historian
two
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
out
of
three
and
a
quarter
millions
were
thrown
into
the
sea
on
that
fatal
passage
while
the
remainder
were
consigned
to
nameless
misery
in
the
mines
or
under
the
lash
in
the
cane
and
rice
fields
the
guilt
of
this
great
crime
rests
on
the
christian
church
the
name
of
the
most
holy
the
spanish
government
roman
catholic
concluded
more
than
ten
treaties
authorising
the
sale
of
five
hundred
thousand
human
beings
in
sir
john
hawkins
sailed
on
his
diabolical
errand
of
buying
slaves
in
africa
and
selling
them
in
the
west
indies
in
a
ship
which
bore
the
sacred
name
of
jesus
while
elizabeth
the
protestant
queen
rewarded
him
for
his
success
in
this
first
adventure
of
englishmen
in
that
inhuman
traffic
by
allowing
him
to
wear
as
his
crest
in
his
proper
colour
bound
with
a
cord
or
in
other
words
a
manacled
negro
of
the
quoted
from
the
a
or
lodge
composed
solely
of
or
a
branch
as
they
are
now
somewhat
bombastically
called
iv
the
relations
of
the
theosophical
society
to
theosophy
on
enq
is
moral
elevation
then
the
principal
thing
insisted
upon
in
your
society
theo
undoubtedly
he
who
would
be
a
true
theosophist
must
bring
himself
to
live
as
one
enq
if
so
then
as
i
remarked
before
the
behaviour
of
some
members
strangely
belies
this
fundamental
rule
theo
indeed
it
does
but
this
can
not
be
helped
among
us
any
more
than
amongst
those
who
call
themselves
christians
and
act
like
fiends
this
is
no
fault
of
our
statutes
and
rules
but
that
of
human
nature
even
in
some
exoteric
public
branches
the
members
pledge
themselves
on
their
to
live
life
prescribed
by
theosophy
they
have
to
bring
their
to
guide
their
every
thought
and
action
every
day
and
at
every
moment
of
their
lives
a
true
theosophist
ought
deal
justly
and
walk
enq
what
do
you
mean
by
this
theo
simply
this
the
one
self
has
to
forget
itself
for
the
many
selves
let
me
answer
you
in
the
words
of
a
true
philaletheian
an
who
has
beautifully
expressed
it
in
the
every
man
needs
first
is
to
find
himself
and
then
take
an
honest
inventory
of
his
subjective
possessions
and
bad
or
bankrupt
as
it
may
be
it
is
not
beyond
redemption
if
we
set
about
it
in
but
how
many
do
all
are
willing
to
work
for
their
own
development
and
progress
very
few
for
those
of
others
to
quote
the
same
writer
again
have
been
deceived
and
deluded
long
enough
they
must
break
their
idols
put
away
their
shams
and
go
to
work
for
there
is
one
little
word
too
much
or
too
many
for
he
who
works
for
himself
had
better
not
work
at
all
rather
let
him
work
himself
for
others
for
all
for
every
flower
of
love
and
charity
he
plants
in
his
garden
a
loathsome
weed
will
disappear
from
his
own
and
so
this
garden
of
the
blossom
as
a
rose
in
all
bibles
all
religions
this
is
plainly
set
designing
men
have
at
first
misinterpreted
and
finally
emasculated
materialized
besotted
them
it
does
not
require
a
new
revelation
let
every
man
be
a
revelation
unto
himself
let
once
immortal
spirit
take
possession
of
the
temple
of
his
body
drive
out
the
and
every
unclean
thing
and
his
own
divine
humanity
will
redeem
him
for
when
he
is
thus
at
one
with
himself
if
he
will
know
the
of
the
enq
this
is
pure
altruism
i
confess
theo
it
is
and
if
only
one
fellow
of
the
out
of
ten
would
practise
it
ours
would
be
a
body
of
elect
indeed
but
there
are
those
among
the
outsiders
who
will
always
refuse
to
see
the
essential
difference
between
theosophy
and
the
theosophical
society
the
idea
and
its
imperfect
embodiment
such
would
visit
every
sin
and
shortcoming
of
the
vehicle
the
human
body
on
the
pure
spirit
which
sheds
thereon
its
divine
light
is
this
just
to
either
they
throw
stones
at
an
association
that
tries
to
work
up
to
and
for
the
propagation
of
its
ideal
with
most
tremendous
odds
against
it
some
vilify
the
theosophical
society
only
because
it
presumes
to
attempt
to
do
that
in
which
other
and
state
christianity
failed
most
egregiously
others
because
they
would
fain
preserve
the
existing
state
of
things
pharisees
and
sadducees
in
the
seat
of
moses
and
publicans
and
sinners
revelling
in
high
places
as
under
the
roman
empire
during
its
decadence
people
at
any
rate
ought
to
remember
that
the
man
who
does
all
he
can
does
as
much
as
he
who
has
achieved
the
most
in
this
world
of
relative
possibilities
this
is
a
simple
truism
an
axiom
supported
for
believers
in
the
gospels
by
the
parable
of
the
talents
given
by
their
master
the
servant
who
doubled
his
two
talents
was
rewarded
as
much
as
that
other
who
had
received
to
every
man
it
is
given
to
his
several
enq
yet
it
is
rather
difficult
to
draw
the
line
of
demarcation
between
the
abstract
and
the
concrete
in
this
case
as
we
have
only
the
latter
to
our
judgment
by
theo
then
why
make
an
exception
for
the
justice
like
charity
ought
to
begin
at
home
will
you
revile
and
scoff
at
the
on
the
because
your
social
political
and
even
religious
laws
have
so
far
not
only
failed
to
carry
out
its
precepts
in
their
spirit
but
even
in
their
dead
letter
abolish
the
oath
in
courts
parliament
army
and
everywhere
and
do
as
the
quakers
do
if
you
call
yourselves
christians
abolish
the
courts
themselves
for
if
you
would
follow
the
commandments
of
christ
you
have
to
give
away
your
coat
to
him
who
deprives
you
of
your
cloak
and
turn
your
left
cheek
to
the
bully
who
smites
you
on
the
right
not
evil
love
your
enemies
bless
them
that
curse
you
do
good
to
them
that
hate
you
for
shall
break
one
of
the
least
of
these
commandments
and
shall
teach
men
so
he
shall
be
called
the
least
in
the
kingdom
of
heaven
and
shall
say
shall
be
in
danger
of
hell
and
why
should
you
judge
if
you
would
not
be
judged
in
your
turn
insist
that
between
theosophy
and
the
theosophical
society
there
is
no
difference
and
forthwith
you
lay
the
system
of
christianity
and
its
very
essence
open
to
the
same
charges
only
in
a
more
serious
form
enq
why
serious
theo
because
while
the
leaders
of
the
theosophical
movement
recognising
fully
their
shortcomings
try
all
they
can
do
to
amend
their
ways
and
uproot
the
evil
existing
in
the
society
and
while
their
rules
and
are
framed
in
the
spirit
of
theosophy
the
legislators
and
the
churches
of
nations
and
countries
which
call
themselves
christian
do
the
reverse
our
members
even
the
worst
among
them
are
no
worse
than
the
average
christian
moreover
if
the
western
theosophists
experience
so
much
difficulty
in
leading
the
true
theosophical
life
it
is
because
they
are
all
the
children
of
their
generation
every
one
of
them
was
a
christian
bred
and
brought
up
in
the
sophistry
of
his
church
his
social
customs
and
even
his
paradoxical
laws
he
was
this
before
he
became
a
theosophist
or
rather
a
member
of
the
society
of
that
name
as
it
can
not
be
too
often
repeated
that
between
the
abstract
ideal
and
its
vehicle
there
is
a
most
important
difference
the
abstract
and
the
concrete
enq
please
elucidate
this
difference
a
little
more
theo
the
society
is
a
great
body
of
men
and
women
composed
of
the
most
heterogeneous
elements
theosophy
in
its
abstract
meaning
is
divine
wisdom
or
the
aggregate
of
the
knowledge
and
wisdom
that
underlie
the
homogeneity
of
eternal
good
and
in
its
concrete
sense
it
is
the
sum
total
of
the
same
as
allotted
to
man
by
nature
on
this
earth
and
no
more
some
members
earnestly
endeavour
to
realize
and
so
to
speak
to
objectivize
theosophy
in
their
lives
while
others
desire
only
to
know
of
not
to
practise
it
and
others
still
may
have
joined
the
society
merely
out
of
curiosity
or
a
passing
interest
or
perhaps
again
because
some
of
their
friends
belong
to
it
how
then
can
the
system
be
judged
by
the
standard
of
those
who
would
assume
the
name
without
any
right
to
it
is
poetry
or
its
muse
to
be
measured
only
by
those
poets
who
afflict
our
ears
the
society
can
be
regarded
as
the
embodiment
of
theosophy
only
in
its
abstract
motives
it
can
never
presume
to
call
itself
its
concrete
vehicle
so
long
as
human
imperfections
and
weaknesses
are
all
represented
in
its
body
otherwise
the
society
would
be
only
repeating
the
great
error
and
the
outflowing
sacrileges
of
the
churches
of
christ
if
eastern
comparisons
may
be
permitted
theosophy
is
the
shoreless
ocean
of
universal
truth
love
and
wisdom
reflecting
its
radiance
on
the
earth
while
the
theosophical
society
is
only
a
visible
bubble
on
that
reflection
theosophy
is
divine
nature
visible
and
invisible
and
its
society
human
nature
trying
to
ascend
to
its
divine
parent
theosophy
finally
is
the
fixed
eternal
sun
and
its
society
the
evanescent
comet
trying
to
settle
in
an
orbit
to
become
a
planet
ever
revolving
within
the
attraction
of
the
sun
of
truth
it
was
formed
to
assist
in
showing
to
men
that
such
a
thing
as
theosophy
exists
and
to
help
them
to
ascend
towards
it
by
studying
and
assimilating
its
eternal
verities
enq
i
thought
you
said
you
had
no
tenets
or
doctrines
of
your
own
theo
no
more
we
have
the
society
has
no
wisdom
of
its
own
to
support
or
teach
it
is
simply
the
storehouse
of
all
the
truths
uttered
by
the
great
seers
initiates
and
prophets
of
historic
and
even
ages
at
least
as
many
as
it
can
get
therefore
it
is
merely
the
channel
through
which
more
or
less
of
truth
found
in
the
accumulated
utterances
of
great
teachers
is
poured
out
into
the
world
enq
but
is
such
truth
unreachable
outside
of
the
society
does
not
every
church
claim
the
same
theo
not
at
all
the
undeniable
existence
of
great
of
that
such
wisdom
was
often
reached
by
isolated
individuals
never
however
without
the
guidance
of
a
master
at
first
but
most
of
the
followers
of
such
when
they
became
masters
in
their
turn
have
dwarfed
the
catholicism
of
these
teachings
into
the
narrow
groove
of
their
own
sectarian
dogmas
the
commandments
of
chosen
master
alone
were
then
adopted
and
followed
to
the
exclusion
of
all
followed
at
all
note
well
as
in
the
case
of
the
sermon
on
the
mount
each
religion
is
thus
a
bit
of
the
divine
truth
made
to
focus
a
vast
panorama
of
human
fancy
which
claimed
to
represent
and
replace
that
truth
enq
but
theosophy
you
say
is
not
a
religion
theo
most
assuredly
it
is
not
since
it
is
the
essence
of
all
religion
and
of
absolute
truth
a
drop
of
which
only
underlies
every
creed
to
resort
once
more
to
metaphor
theosophy
on
earth
is
like
the
white
ray
of
the
spectrum
and
every
religion
only
one
of
the
seven
prismatic
colours
ignoring
all
the
others
and
cursing
them
as
false
every
special
coloured
ray
claims
not
only
priority
but
to
be
white
itself
and
anathematizes
even
its
own
tints
from
light
to
dark
as
heresies
yet
as
the
sun
of
truth
rises
higher
and
higher
on
the
horizon
of
perception
and
each
coloured
ray
gradually
fades
out
until
it
is
finally
reabsorbed
in
its
turn
humanity
will
at
last
be
cursed
no
longer
with
artificial
polarizations
but
will
find
itself
bathing
in
the
pure
colourless
sunlight
of
eternal
truth
and
this
will
be
enq
your
claim
is
then
that
all
the
great
religions
are
derived
from
theosophy
and
that
it
is
by
assimilating
it
that
the
world
will
be
finally
saved
from
the
curse
of
its
great
illusions
and
errors
theo
precisely
so
and
we
add
that
our
theosophical
society
is
the
humble
seed
which
if
watered
and
left
to
live
will
finally
produce
the
tree
of
knowledge
of
good
and
evil
which
is
grafted
on
the
tree
of
life
eternal
for
it
is
only
by
studying
the
various
great
religions
and
philosophies
of
humanity
by
comparing
them
dispassionately
and
with
an
unbiased
mind
that
men
can
hope
to
arrive
at
the
truth
it
is
especially
by
finding
out
and
noting
their
various
points
of
agreement
that
we
may
achieve
this
result
for
no
sooner
do
we
by
study
or
by
being
taught
by
someone
who
their
inner
meaning
than
we
find
almost
in
every
case
that
it
expresses
some
great
truth
in
nature
enq
we
have
heard
of
a
golden
age
that
was
and
what
you
describe
would
be
a
golden
age
to
be
realised
at
some
future
day
when
shall
it
be
theo
not
before
humanity
as
a
whole
feels
the
need
of
it
a
maxim
in
the
persian
says
is
of
two
manifest
and
the
other
demanding
incessantly
new
demonstrations
and
it
is
only
when
this
latter
kind
of
truth
becomes
as
universally
obvious
as
it
is
now
dim
and
therefore
liable
to
be
distorted
by
sophistry
and
casuistry
it
is
only
when
the
two
kinds
will
have
become
once
more
one
that
all
people
will
be
brought
to
see
alike
enq
but
surely
those
few
who
have
felt
the
need
of
such
truths
must
have
made
up
their
minds
to
believe
in
something
definite
you
tell
me
that
the
society
having
no
doctrines
of
its
own
every
member
may
believe
as
he
chooses
and
accept
what
he
pleases
this
looks
as
if
the
theosophical
society
was
bent
upon
reviving
the
confusion
of
languages
and
beliefs
of
the
tower
of
babel
of
old
have
you
no
beliefs
in
common
theo
what
is
meant
by
the
society
having
no
tenets
or
doctrines
of
its
own
is
that
no
special
doctrines
or
beliefs
are
on
its
members
but
of
course
this
applies
only
to
the
body
as
a
whole
the
society
as
you
were
told
is
divided
into
an
outer
and
an
inner
body
those
who
belong
to
the
latter
have
of
course
a
philosophy
you
so
prefer
a
religious
system
of
their
own
enq
may
we
be
told
what
it
is
theo
we
make
no
secret
of
it
it
was
outlined
a
few
years
ago
in
the
and
buddhism
and
may
be
found
still
more
elaborated
in
the
it
is
based
on
the
oldest
philosophy
in
the
world
called
the
or
the
archaic
doctrine
if
you
like
you
may
ask
questions
and
have
them
explained
the
fundamental
teachings
of
theosophy
on
god
and
prayer
enq
do
you
believe
in
god
theo
that
depends
what
you
mean
by
the
term
enq
i
mean
the
god
of
the
christians
the
father
of
jesus
and
the
creator
the
biblical
god
of
moses
in
short
theo
in
such
a
god
we
do
not
believe
we
reject
the
idea
of
a
personal
or
an
and
anthropomorphic
god
who
is
but
the
gigantic
shadow
of
and
not
of
man
at
his
best
either
the
god
of
theology
we
prove
a
bundle
of
contradictions
and
a
logical
impossibility
therefore
we
will
have
nothing
to
do
with
him
enq
state
your
reasons
if
you
please
theo
they
are
many
and
can
not
all
receive
attention
but
here
are
a
few
this
god
is
called
by
his
devotees
infinite
and
absolute
is
he
not
enq
i
believe
he
is
theo
then
if
especially
if
absolute
how
can
he
have
a
form
and
be
a
creator
of
anything
form
implies
limitation
and
a
beginning
as
well
as
an
end
and
in
order
to
create
a
being
must
think
and
plan
how
can
the
absolute
be
supposed
to
to
have
any
relation
whatever
to
that
which
is
limited
finite
and
conditioned
this
is
a
philosophical
and
a
logical
absurdity
even
the
hebrew
kabala
rejects
such
an
idea
and
therefore
makes
of
the
one
and
the
absolute
deific
principle
an
infinite
unity
called
in
order
to
create
the
creator
has
to
become
active
and
as
this
is
impossible
for
absoluteness
the
infinite
principle
had
to
be
shown
becoming
the
cause
of
evolution
not
creation
in
an
indirect
through
the
emanation
from
itself
another
absurdity
due
this
time
to
the
translators
of
the
kabala
of
the
sephiroth
enq
how
about
those
kabalists
who
while
being
such
still
believe
in
jehovah
or
the
theo
they
are
at
liberty
to
believe
in
what
they
please
as
their
belief
or
disbelief
can
hardly
affect
a
fact
the
jesuits
tell
us
that
two
and
two
are
not
always
four
to
a
certainty
since
it
depends
on
the
will
of
god
to
make
x
shall
we
accept
their
sophistry
for
all
that
enq
then
you
are
atheists
theo
not
that
we
know
of
and
not
unless
the
epithet
of
is
to
be
applied
to
those
who
disbelieve
in
an
anthropomorphic
god
we
believe
in
a
universal
divine
principle
the
root
of
all
from
which
all
proceeds
and
within
which
all
shall
be
absorbed
at
the
end
of
the
great
cycle
of
being
enq
this
is
the
old
old
claim
of
pantheism
if
you
are
pantheists
you
can
not
be
deists
and
if
you
are
not
deists
then
you
have
to
answer
to
the
name
of
atheists
theo
not
necessarily
so
the
term
is
again
one
of
the
many
abused
terms
whose
real
and
primitive
meaning
has
been
distorted
by
blind
prejudice
and
a
view
of
it
if
you
accept
the
christian
etymology
of
this
compound
word
and
form
it
of
παν
and
θεος
and
then
imagine
and
teach
that
this
means
that
every
stone
and
every
tree
in
nature
is
a
god
or
the
one
god
then
of
course
you
will
be
right
and
make
of
pantheists
in
addition
to
their
legitimate
name
but
you
will
hardly
be
as
successful
if
you
etymologise
the
word
pantheism
esoterically
and
as
we
do
enq
what
is
then
your
definition
of
it
theo
let
me
ask
you
a
question
in
my
turn
what
do
you
understand
by
pan
or
nature
enq
nature
is
i
suppose
the
sum
total
of
things
existing
around
us
the
aggregate
of
causes
and
effects
in
the
world
of
matter
the
creation
or
universe
theo
hence
the
personified
sum
and
order
of
known
causes
and
effects
the
total
of
all
finite
agencies
and
forces
as
utterly
disconnected
from
an
intelligent
creator
or
creators
and
perhaps
of
as
a
single
and
separate
in
your
cyclopædias
enq
yes
i
believe
so
theo
well
we
neither
take
into
consideration
this
objective
and
material
nature
which
we
call
an
evanescent
illusion
nor
do
we
mean
by
παν
nature
in
the
sense
of
its
accepted
derivation
from
the
latin
becoming
from
to
be
born
when
we
speak
of
the
deity
and
make
it
identical
hence
coeval
with
nature
the
eternal
and
uncreate
nature
is
meant
and
not
your
aggregate
of
flitting
shadows
and
finite
unrealities
we
leave
it
to
the
to
call
the
visible
sky
or
heaven
throne
and
our
earth
of
mud
his
footstool
our
deity
is
neither
in
a
paradise
nor
in
a
particular
tree
building
or
mountain
it
is
everywhere
in
every
atom
of
the
visible
as
of
the
invisible
cosmos
in
over
and
around
every
invisible
atom
and
divisible
molecule
for
it
is
the
mysterious
power
of
evolution
and
involution
the
omnipresent
omnipotent
and
even
omniscient
creative
potentiality
enq
stop
omniscience
is
the
prerogative
of
something
that
thinks
and
you
deny
to
your
absoluteness
the
power
of
thought
theo
we
deny
it
to
the
absolute
since
thought
is
something
limited
and
conditioned
but
you
evidently
forget
that
in
philosophy
absolute
unconsciousness
is
also
absolute
consciousness
as
otherwise
it
would
not
be
enq
then
your
absolute
thinks
theo
no
it
does
not
for
the
simple
reason
that
it
is
itself
nor
does
it
exist
for
the
same
reason
as
it
is
absolute
existence
and
not
a
being
read
the
superb
kabalistic
poem
by
solomon
ben
jehudah
gabirol
in
the
and
you
will
understand
art
one
the
root
of
all
numbers
but
not
as
an
element
of
numeration
for
unity
admits
not
of
multiplication
change
or
form
thou
art
one
and
in
the
secret
of
thy
unity
the
wisest
of
men
are
lost
because
they
know
it
not
thou
art
one
and
thy
unity
is
never
diminished
never
extended
and
can
not
be
changed
thou
art
one
and
no
thought
of
mine
can
fix
for
thee
a
limit
or
define
thee
thou
art
but
not
as
one
existent
for
the
understanding
and
vision
of
mortals
can
not
attain
to
thy
existence
nor
determine
for
thee
the
where
the
how
and
the
why
etc
in
short
our
deity
is
the
eternal
incessantly
not
builder
of
the
universe
that
itself
out
of
its
own
essence
not
being
it
is
a
sphere
without
circumference
in
its
symbolism
which
has
but
one
attribute
embracing
all
other
existing
or
thinkable
it
is
the
one
law
giving
the
impulse
to
manifested
eternal
and
immutable
laws
within
that
absolute
law
which
in
its
manifesting
periods
is
enq
i
once
heard
one
of
your
members
remarking
that
universal
deity
being
everywhere
was
in
vessels
of
dishonour
as
in
those
of
honour
and
therefore
was
present
in
every
atom
of
my
cigar
ash
is
this
not
rank
blasphemy
theo
i
do
not
think
so
as
simple
logic
can
hardly
be
regarded
as
blasphemy
were
we
to
exclude
the
omnipresent
principle
from
one
single
mathematical
point
of
the
universe
or
from
a
particle
of
matter
occupying
any
conceivable
space
could
we
still
regard
it
as
infinite
is
it
necessary
to
pray
enq
do
you
believe
in
prayer
and
do
you
ever
pray
theo
we
do
not
we
instead
of
enq
you
do
not
offer
prayers
even
to
the
absolute
principle
theo
why
should
we
being
people
we
can
hardly
afford
to
lose
time
in
addressing
verbal
prayers
to
a
pure
abstraction
the
unknowable
is
capable
of
relations
only
in
its
parts
to
each
other
but
is
as
regards
any
finite
relations
the
visible
universe
depends
for
its
existence
and
phenomena
on
its
mutually
acting
forms
and
their
laws
not
on
prayer
or
prayers
enq
do
you
not
believe
at
all
in
the
efficacy
of
prayer
theo
not
in
prayer
taught
in
so
many
words
and
repeated
externally
if
by
prayer
you
mean
the
outward
petition
to
an
unknown
god
as
the
addressee
which
was
inaugurated
by
the
jews
and
popularised
by
the
pharisees
enq
is
there
any
other
kind
of
prayer
theo
most
decidedly
we
call
it
and
it
is
rather
an
internal
command
than
a
petition
enq
to
whom
then
do
you
pray
when
you
do
so
theo
to
father
in
its
esoteric
meaning
enq
is
that
different
from
the
one
given
to
it
in
theology
theo
entirely
so
an
occultist
or
a
theosophist
addresses
his
prayer
to
father
which
is
in
read
and
try
to
understand
ch
vi
matthew
not
to
an
and
therefore
finite
god
and
that
is
in
man
himself
enq
then
you
make
of
man
a
god
theo
please
say
and
not
god
in
our
sense
the
inner
man
is
the
only
god
we
can
have
cognizance
of
and
how
can
this
be
otherwise
grant
us
our
postulate
that
god
is
a
universally
diffused
infinite
principle
and
how
can
man
alone
escape
from
being
soaked
through
and
the
deity
we
call
our
in
that
deific
essence
of
which
we
are
cognizant
within
us
in
our
heart
and
spiritual
consciousness
and
which
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
anthropomorphic
conception
we
may
form
of
it
in
our
physical
brain
or
its
fancy
ye
not
that
ye
are
the
temple
of
god
and
that
the
great
spirit
of
that
the
spirit
of
the
absolute
god
dwelleth
in
you
yet
let
no
man
anthropomorphise
that
essence
in
us
let
no
theosophist
if
he
would
hold
to
divine
not
human
truth
say
that
this
in
listens
to
or
is
distinct
from
either
finite
man
or
the
infinite
all
are
one
nor
as
just
remarked
that
a
prayer
is
a
petition
it
is
a
mystery
rather
an
occult
process
by
which
finite
and
conditioned
thoughts
and
desires
unable
to
be
assimilated
by
the
absolute
spirit
which
is
unconditioned
are
translated
into
spiritual
wills
and
the
will
such
process
being
called
the
intensity
of
our
ardent
aspirations
changes
prayer
into
the
stone
or
that
which
transmutes
lead
into
pure
gold
the
only
homogeneous
essence
our
becomes
the
active
or
creative
force
producing
effects
according
to
our
desire
enq
do
you
mean
to
say
that
prayer
is
an
occult
process
bringing
about
physical
results
theo
i
do
becomes
a
living
power
but
woe
unto
those
occultists
and
theosophists
who
instead
of
crushing
out
the
desires
of
the
lower
personal
or
physical
man
and
saying
addressing
their
spiritual
ego
immersed
in
light
will
be
done
not
mine
send
up
waves
of
for
selfish
or
unholy
purposes
for
this
is
black
magic
abomination
and
spiritual
sorcery
unfortunately
all
this
is
the
favorite
occupation
of
our
christian
statesmen
and
generals
especially
when
the
latter
are
sending
two
armies
to
murder
each
other
both
indulge
before
action
in
a
bit
of
such
sorcery
by
offering
respectively
prayers
to
the
same
god
of
hosts
each
entreating
his
help
to
cut
its
throats
enq
david
prayed
to
the
lord
of
hosts
to
help
him
smite
the
philistines
and
slay
the
syrians
and
the
moabites
and
lord
preserved
david
whithersoever
he
in
that
we
only
follow
what
we
find
in
the
bible
theo
of
course
you
do
but
since
you
delight
in
calling
yourselves
christians
not
israelites
or
jews
as
far
as
we
know
why
do
you
not
rather
follow
that
which
christ
says
and
he
distinctly
commands
you
not
to
follow
of
old
times
or
the
mosaic
law
but
bids
you
do
as
he
tells
you
and
warns
those
who
would
kill
by
the
sword
that
they
too
will
perish
by
the
sword
christ
has
given
you
one
prayer
of
which
you
have
made
a
lip
prayer
and
a
boast
and
which
none
but
the
occultist
understands
in
it
you
say
in
your
meaning
us
our
debts
as
we
forgive
our
debtors
which
you
never
do
again
he
told
you
to
your
and
do
to
them
that
hate
it
is
surely
not
the
prophet
of
who
taught
you
to
pray
to
your
to
slay
and
give
you
victory
over
your
enemies
this
is
why
we
reject
what
you
call
enq
but
how
do
you
explain
the
universal
fact
that
all
nations
and
peoples
have
prayed
to
and
worshipped
a
god
or
gods
some
have
adored
and
propitiated
and
harmful
spirits
but
this
only
proves
the
universality
of
the
belief
in
the
efficacy
of
prayer
theo
it
is
explained
by
that
other
fact
that
prayer
has
several
other
meanings
besides
that
given
it
by
the
christians
it
means
not
only
a
pleading
or
but
meant
in
days
of
old
far
more
an
invocation
and
incantation
the
or
the
rhythmically
chanted
prayer
of
the
hindus
has
precisely
such
a
meaning
as
the
brahmins
hold
themselves
higher
than
the
common
or
a
prayer
may
be
an
appeal
or
an
incantation
for
malediction
and
a
curse
as
in
the
case
of
two
armies
praying
simultaneously
for
mutual
destruction
as
much
as
for
blessing
and
as
the
great
majority
of
people
are
intensely
selfish
and
pray
only
for
themselves
asking
to
be
their
instead
of
working
for
it
and
begging
god
not
to
lead
them
but
to
deliver
them
the
memoralists
only
from
evil
the
result
is
that
prayer
as
now
understood
is
doubly
pernicious
it
kills
in
man
it
develops
in
him
a
still
more
ferocious
selfishness
and
egotism
than
he
is
already
endowed
with
by
nature
i
repeat
that
we
believe
in
and
simultaneous
action
in
unison
with
our
in
and
in
rare
moments
of
ecstatic
bliss
in
the
mingling
of
our
higher
soul
with
the
universal
essence
attracted
as
it
is
towards
its
origin
and
centre
a
state
called
during
life
and
after
death
we
refuse
to
pray
to
finite
gods
saints
angels
because
we
regard
it
as
idolatry
we
can
not
pray
to
the
absolute
for
reasons
explained
before
therefore
we
try
to
replace
fruitless
and
useless
prayer
by
meritorious
and
actions
enq
christians
would
call
it
pride
and
blasphemy
are
they
wrong
theo
entirely
so
it
is
they
on
the
contrary
who
show
satanic
pride
in
their
belief
that
the
absolute
or
the
infinite
even
if
there
was
such
a
thing
as
the
possibility
of
any
relation
between
the
unconditioned
and
the
stoop
to
listen
to
every
foolish
or
egotistical
prayer
and
it
is
they
again
who
virtually
blaspheme
in
teaching
that
an
omniscient
and
omnipotent
god
needs
uttered
prayers
to
know
what
he
has
to
do
corroborated
by
both
buddha
and
jesus
the
one
says
nought
from
the
helpless
not
rather
for
darkness
will
not
brighten
ask
nought
from
silence
for
it
can
neither
speak
nor
and
the
ye
shall
ask
in
my
name
that
of
christos
that
will
i
of
course
this
quotation
if
taken
in
its
sense
goes
against
our
argument
but
if
we
accept
it
esoterically
with
the
full
knowledge
of
the
meaning
of
the
term
which
to
us
represents
the
it
comes
to
this
the
only
god
we
must
recognise
and
pray
to
or
rather
act
in
unison
with
is
that
spirit
of
god
of
which
our
body
is
the
temple
and
in
which
it
dwelleth
prayer
kills
self
reliance
enq
but
did
not
christ
himself
pray
and
recommend
prayer
theo
it
is
so
recorded
but
those
are
precisely
of
that
kind
of
communion
just
mentioned
with
in
otherwise
and
if
we
identify
jesus
with
the
universal
deity
there
would
be
something
too
absurdly
illogical
in
the
inevitable
conclusion
that
he
the
god
to
and
separated
the
will
of
that
god
from
his
own
enq
one
argument
more
an
argument
moreover
much
used
by
some
christians
they
say
feel
that
i
am
not
able
to
conquer
any
passions
and
weaknesses
in
my
own
strength
but
when
i
pray
to
jesus
christ
i
feel
that
he
gives
me
strength
and
that
in
his
power
i
am
able
to
theo
no
wonder
if
is
god
and
one
independent
and
separate
from
him
who
prays
of
course
everything
is
and
be
possible
to
mighty
but
then
the
merit
or
justice
either
of
such
a
conquest
why
should
the
be
rewarded
for
something
done
which
has
cost
him
only
prayers
would
you
even
a
simple
mortal
man
pay
your
labourer
a
full
wage
if
you
did
most
of
his
work
for
him
he
sitting
under
an
apple
tree
and
praying
to
you
to
do
so
all
the
while
this
idea
of
passing
whole
life
in
moral
idleness
and
having
hardest
work
and
duty
done
by
god
or
most
revolting
to
us
as
it
is
most
degrading
to
human
dignity
enq
perhaps
so
yet
it
is
the
idea
of
trusting
in
a
personal
saviour
to
help
and
strengthen
in
the
battle
of
life
which
is
the
fundamental
idea
of
modern
christianity
and
there
is
no
doubt
that
subjectively
such
belief
is
efficacious
that
those
who
believe
feel
themselves
helped
and
strengthened
theo
nor
is
there
any
more
doubt
that
some
patients
of
and
great
also
sometimes
cured
nor
that
hypnotism
and
suggestion
psychology
and
even
mediumship
will
produce
such
results
as
often
if
not
oftener
you
take
into
consideration
and
string
on
the
thread
of
your
argument
successes
alone
and
how
about
ten
times
the
number
of
failures
surely
you
will
not
presume
to
say
that
failure
is
unknown
even
with
a
sufficiency
of
blind
faith
among
fanatical
christians
enq
but
how
can
you
explain
those
cases
which
are
followed
by
full
success
where
does
a
theosophist
look
to
for
power
to
subdue
his
passions
and
selfishness
theo
to
his
higher
self
the
divine
spirit
or
the
god
in
him
and
to
his
how
long
shall
we
have
to
repeat
over
and
over
again
that
the
tree
is
known
by
its
fruit
the
nature
of
the
cause
by
its
effects
you
speak
of
subduing
passions
and
becoming
good
through
and
with
the
help
of
god
or
christ
we
ask
where
do
you
find
more
virtuous
guiltless
people
abstaining
from
sin
and
crime
in
christendom
or
christian
countries
or
in
heathen
lands
statistics
are
there
to
give
the
answer
and
corroborate
our
claims
according
to
the
last
census
in
ceylon
and
india
in
the
comparative
table
of
crimes
committed
by
christians
mussulmen
hindoos
eurasians
buddhists
on
two
millions
of
population
taken
at
random
from
each
and
covering
the
misdemeanours
of
several
years
the
proportion
of
crimes
committed
by
the
christian
stands
as
to
as
against
those
committed
by
the
buddhist
population
vide

and
every

will
fail
to
give

to

before

yet
the

not
the
true
buddhist
siamese
sect
at
all
events
do
not
believe
in
either
god
or
a
future
reward
outside
of

earth
they
do
not
pray
neither

nor

they
would
exclaim
in
wonder

or
what
enq
then
they
are
truly
atheists
theo
most
undeniably
but
they
are
also
the
most
and
men
in
the
whole
world
buddhism
says
respect
the
religions
of
other
men
and
remain
true
to
your
own
but
church
christianity
denouncing
all
the
gods
of
other
nations
as
devils
would
doom
every
to
eternal
perdition
enq
does
not
the
buddhist
priesthood
do
the
same
theo
never
they
hold
too
much
to
the
wise
precept
found
in
the
dhammapada
to
do
so
for
they
know
that
any
man
whether
he
be
learned
or
not
consider
himself
so
great
as
to
despise
other
men
he
is
like
a
blind
man
holding
a
himself
he
illumines
on
the
source
of
the
human
soul
enq
how
then
do
you
account
for
man
being
endowed
with
a
spirit
and
soul
whence
these
theo
from
the
universal
soul
certainly
not
bestowed
by
a
god
whence
the
moist
element
in
the
from
the
ocean
which
surrounds
it
in
which
it
lives
and
breathes
and
has
its
being
and
whither
it
returns
when
dissolved
enq
so
you
reject
the
teaching
that
soul
is
given
or
breathed
into
man
by
god
theo
we
are
obliged
to
the
spoken
of
in
ch
ii
of
genesis
is
as
therein
stated
the
or
the
animal
soul
with
which
god
we
say
and
endows
man
like
every
animal
is
not
at
all
the
thinking
soul
or
mind
least
of
all
is
it
the
enq
well
let
us
put
it
otherwise
is
it
god
who
endows
man
with
a
human
soul
and
immortal
spirit
theo
again
in
the
way
you
put
the
question
we
must
object
to
it
since
we
believe
in
no
god
how
can
we
believe
that
he
endows
man
with
anything
but
granting
for
the
sake
of
argument
a
god
who
takes
upon
himself
the
risk
of
creating
a
new
soul
for
every
baby
all
that
can
be
said
is
that
such
a
god
can
hardly
be
regarded
as
himself
endowed
with
any
wisdom
or
prevision
certain
other
difficulties
and
the
impossibility
of
reconciling
this
with
the
claims
made
for
the
mercy
justice
equity
and
omniscience
of
that
god
are
so
many
deadly
reefs
on
which
this
theological
dogma
is
daily
and
hourly
broken
enq
what
do
you
mean
what
difficulties
theo
i
am
thinking
of
an
unanswerable
argument
offered
once
in
my
presence
by
a
cingalese
buddhist
priest
a
famous
preacher
to
a
christian
in
no
way
ignorant
or
unprepared
for
the
public
discussion
during
which
it
was
advanced
it
was
near
colombo
and
the
missionary
had
challenged
the
priest
megattivati
to
give
his
reasons
why
the
christian
god
should
not
be
accepted
by
the
well
the
missionary
came
out
of
that
for
ever
memorable
discussion
second
best
as
usual
enq
i
should
be
glad
to
learn
in
what
way
theo
simply
this
the
buddhist
priest
premised
by
asking
the
whether
his
god
had
given
commandments
to
moses
only
for
men
to
keep
but
to
be
broken
by
god
himself
the
missionary
denied
the
supposition
indignantly
well
said
his
opponent
tell
us
that
god
makes
no
exceptions
to
this
rule
and
that
no
soul
can
be
born
without
his
will
now
god
forbids
adultery
among
other
things
and
yet
you
say
in
the
same
breath
that
it
is
he
who
creates
every
baby
born
and
he
who
endows
it
with
a
soul
are
we
then
to
understand
that
the
millions
of
children
born
in
crime
and
adultery
are
your
work
that
your
god
forbids
and
punishes
the
breaking
of
his
laws
and
that
nevertheless
creates
daily
and
hourly
souls
for
just
such
according
to
the
simplest
logic
your
god
is
an
accomplice
in
the
crime
since
but
for
his
help
and
interference
no
such
children
of
lust
could
be
born
where
is
the
justice
of
punishing
not
only
the
guilty
parents
but
even
the
innocent
babe
for
that
which
is
done
by
that
very
god
whom
yet
you
exonerate
from
any
guilt
himself
the
missionary
looked
at
his
watch
and
suddenly
found
it
was
getting
too
late
for
further
discussion
enq
you
forget
that
all
such
inexplicable
cases
are
mysteries
and
that
we
are
forbidden
by
our
religion
to
pry
into
the
mysteries
of
god
theo
no
we
do
not
forget
but
simply
reject
such
impossibilities
nor
do
we
want
you
to
believe
as
we
do
we
only
answer
the
questions
you
ask
we
have
however
another
name
for
your
the
buddhist
teachings
on
the
above
enq
what
does
buddhism
teach
with
regard
to
the
soul
theo
it
depends
whether
you
mean
exoteric
popular
buddhism
or
its
esoteric
teachings
the
former
explains
itself
in
the
in
this
wise
it
considers
a
word
used
by
the
ignorant
to
express
a
false
idea
if
everything
is
subject
to
change
then
man
is
included
and
every
material
part
of
him
must
change
that
which
is
subject
to
change
is
not
permanent
so
there
can
be
no
immortal
survival
of
a
changeful
this
seems
plain
and
definite
but
when
we
come
to
the
question
that
the
new
personality
in
each
succeeding
is
the
aggregate
of
or
the
attributes
of
the
personality
and
ask
whether
this
new
aggregation
of
is
a
being
likewise
in
which
nothing
has
remained
of
the
last
we
read
that
one
sense
it
is
a
new
being
in
another
it
is
not
during
this
life
the
skandhas
are
continually
changing
while
the
man
a
of
forty
is
identical
as
regards
personality
with
the
youth
a
of
eighteen
yet
by
the
continual
waste
and
reparation
of
his
body
and
change
of
mind
and
character
he
is
a
different
being
nevertheless
the
man
in
his
old
age
justly
reaps
the
reward
or
suffering
consequent
upon
his
thoughts
and
actions
at
every
previous
stage
of
his
life
so
the
new
being
of
the
being
the
individuality
as
but
not
the
same
personality
with
but
a
changed
form
or
new
aggregation
of
justly
reaps
the
consequences
of
his
actions
and
thoughts
in
the
previous
this
is
abstruse
metaphysics
and
plainly
does
not
express
in
soul
by
any
means
enq
is
not
something
like
this
spoken
of
in
theo
it
is
for
this
teaching
belongs
both
to
esoteric
or
secret
wisdom
and
to
the
exoteric
buddhism
or
the
religious
philosophy
of
gautama
buddha
enq
but
we
are
distinctly
told
that
most
of
the
buddhists
do
not
believe
in
the
immortality
theo
no
more
do
we
if
you
mean
by
soul
the
or
but
every
learned
buddhist
believes
in
the
individual
or
those
who
do
not
err
in
their
judgment
they
are
as
mistaken
on
this
point
as
those
christians
who
mistake
the
theological
interpolations
of
the
later
editors
of
the
gospels
about
damnation
and
for
utterances
of
jesus
neither
buddha
nor
ever
wrote
anything
themselves
but
both
spoke
in
allegories
and
used
sayings
as
all
true
initiates
did
and
will
do
for
a
long
time
yet
to
come
both
scriptures
treat
of
all
such
metaphysical
questions
very
cautiously
and
both
buddhist
and
christian
records
sin
by
that
excess
of
exotericism
the
dead
letter
meaning
far
overshooting
the
mark
in
both
cases
enq
do
you
mean
to
suggest
that
neither
the
teachings
of
buddha
nor
those
of
christ
have
been
heretofore
rightly
understood
theo
what
i
mean
is
just
as
you
say
both
gospels
the
buddhist
and
the
christian
were
preached
with
the
same
object
in
view
both
reformers
were
ardent
philanthropists
and
practical
most
unmistakably
of
the
noblest
and
highest
type
to
the
bitter
end
the
sins
of
the
whole
world
fall
upon
me
that
i
may
relieve
misery
and
suffering
cries
buddha
would
not
let
one
cry
whom
i
could
save
exclaims
the
clad
in
the
refuse
rags
of
the
unto
me
all
ye
that
labour
and
are
heavy
laden
and
i
will
give
you
rest
is
the
appeal
to
the
poor
and
the
disinherited
made
by
the
of
sorrows
who
hath
not
where
to
lay
his
head
the
teachings
of
both
are
boundless
love
for
humanity
charity
forgiveness
of
injury
forgetfulness
of
self
and
pity
for
the
deluded
masses
both
show
the
same
contempt
for
riches
and
make
no
difference
between
and
their
desire
was
without
revealing
to
the
sacred
mysteries
of
initiation
to
give
the
ignorant
and
the
misled
whose
burden
in
life
was
too
heavy
for
them
hope
enough
and
an
inkling
into
the
truth
sufficient
to
support
them
in
their
heaviest
hours
but
the
object
of
both
reformers
was
frustrated
owing
to
excess
of
zeal
of
their
later
followers
the
words
of
the
masters
having
been
misunderstood
and
misinterpreted
behold
the
consequences
enq
but
surely
buddha
must
have
repudiated
the
immortality
if
all
the
orientalists
and
his
own
priests
say
so
theo
the
arhats
began
by
following
the
policy
of
their
master
and
the
majority
of
the
subsequent
priests
were
not
initiated
just
as
in
christianity
and
so
little
by
little
the
great
esoteric
truths
became
almost
lost
a
proof
in
point
is
that
out
of
the
two
existing
sects
in
ceylon
the
siamese
believes
death
to
be
the
absolute
annihilation
of
individuality
and
personality
and
the
other
explains
nirvana
as
we
theosophists
do
enq
but
why
in
that
case
do
buddhism
and
christianity
represent
the
two
opposite
poles
of
such
belief
theo
because
the
conditions
under
which
they
were
preached
were
not
the
same
in
india
the
brahmins
jealous
of
their
superior
knowledge
and
excluding
from
it
every
caste
save
their
own
had
driven
millions
of
men
into
idolatry
and
almost
fetishism
buddha
had
to
give
the
to
an
exuberance
of
unhealthy
fancy
and
fanatical
superstition
resulting
from
ignorance
such
as
has
rarely
been
known
before
or
after
better
a
philosophical
atheism
than
such
ignorant
worship
for
cry
upon
their
gods
and
are
not
heard
or
are
not
and
who
live
and
die
in
mental
despair
he
had
to
arrest
first
of
all
this
muddy
torrent
of
superstition
to
uproot
before
he
gave
out
the
truth
and
as
he
could
not
give
out
for
the
same
good
reason
as
jesus
who
reminds
disciples
that
the
mysteries
of
heaven
are
not
for
the
unintelligent
masses
but
for
the
elect
alone
and
therefore
he
to
them
in
matt
xiii
his
caution
led
buddha
conceal
too
he
even
refused
to
say
to
the
monk
vacchagotta
whether
there
was
or
was
not
an
ego
in
man
when
pressed
to
answer
exalted
one
maintained
enq
this
refers
to
gautama
but
in
what
way
does
it
touch
the
gospels
theo
read
history
and
think
over
it
at
the
time
the
events
narrated
in
the
gospels
are
alleged
to
have
happened
there
was
a
similar
intellectual
fermentation
taking
place
in
the
whole
civilized
world
only
with
opposite
results
in
the
east
and
the
west
the
old
gods
were
dying
out
while
the
civilized
classes
drifted
in
the
train
of
the
unbelieving
sadducees
into
materialistic
negations
and
mere
mosaic
form
in
palestine
and
into
moral
dissolution
in
rome
the
lowest
and
poorer
classes
ran
after
sorcery
and
strange
gods
or
became
hypocrites
and
pharisees
once
more
the
time
for
a
spiritual
reform
had
arrived
the
cruel
anthropomorphic
and
jealous
god
of
the
jews
with
his
sanguinary
laws
of
eye
for
eye
and
tooth
for
tooth
of
the
shedding
of
blood
and
animal
sacrifice
had
to
be
relegated
to
a
secondary
place
and
replaced
by
the
merciful
in
the
latter
had
to
be
shown
not
as
an
god
but
as
a
divine
saviour
of
the
man
of
flesh
enshrined
in
his
own
heart
and
soul
in
the
poor
as
in
the
rich
no
more
here
than
in
india
could
the
secrets
of
initiation
be
divulged
lest
by
giving
that
which
is
holy
to
the
dogs
and
casting
pearls
before
swine
both
the
and
the
things
revealed
should
be
trodden
under
foot
thus
the
reticence
of
both
buddha
and
the
latter
lived
out
the
historic
period
allotted
to
him
or
not
and
who
equally
abstained
from
revealing
plainly
the
mysteries
of
life
and
in
the
one
case
to
the
blank
negations
of
southern
buddhism
and
in
the
other
to

three
clashing

answer
in

dialogue
translated

that

if

than
anything
that
gautama
buddha
withheld
such
difficult
metaphysical
doctrines
from

masses
in
order
not

perplex
them
more
what
he
meant
was
the
difference
between

the
spiritual
of

theosophical

as
to

the
unity

having

what

the
soul
and
man
are
in

views
can
you
inform

what
they
according
to
your

theo

and
in

the
three
like
the
universe
and
all
therein
are
one
with
the
absolute
unity
the
unknowable
deific
essence
i
spoke
about
sometime
back
we
believe
in
no
but
in
the
periodical
and
consecutive
appearances
of
the
universe
from
the
subjective
on
to
the
objective
plane
of
being
at
regular
intervals
of
time
covering
periods
of
immense
duration
enq
can
you
elaborate
the
subject
theo
take
as
a
first
comparison
and
a
help
towards
a
more
correct
conception
the
solar
year
and
as
a
second
the
two
halves
of
that
year
producing
each
a
day
and
a
night
of
six
duration
at
the
north
pole
now
imagine
if
you
can
instead
of
a
solar
year
of
days
eternity
let
the
sun
represent
the
universe
and
the
polar
days
and
nights
of
months
and
nights
lasting
each
trillions
and
quadrillions
of
instead
of
days
each
as
the
sun
arises
every
morning
on
our
horizon
out
of
its
to
us
and
antipodal
space
so
does
the
universe
emerge
periodically
on
the
plane
of
objectivity
issuing
from
that
of
antipodes
of
the
former
this
is
the
of
and
as
the
sun
disappears
from
our
horizon
so
does
the
universe
disappear
at
regular
periods
when
the
sets
in
the
hindoos
call
such
alternations
the
and
nights
of
brahma
or
the
time
of
and
that
of
dissolution
the
westerns
may
call
them
universal
days
and
nights
if
they
prefer
during
the
latter
the
nights
is
in
every
atom
is
resolved
into
one
homogeneity
evolution
and
illusion
enq
but
who
is
it
that
creates
each
time
the
universe
theo
no
one
creates
it
science
would
call
the
process
evolution
the
philosophers
and
the
orientalists
called
it
emanation
we
occultists
and
theosophists
see
in
it
the
only
universal
and
eternal
casting
a
periodical
reflection
of
on
the
infinite
spatial
depths
this
reflection
which
you
regard
as
the
objective
universe
we
consider
as
a
temporary
and
nothing
else
that
alone
which
is
eternal
is
enq
at
that
rate
you
and
i
are
also
illusions
theo
as
flitting
personalities
one
person
are
would
you
call
the
sudden
flashes
of
the
the
northern
lights
a
though
it
is
as
real
as
can
be
while
you
look
at
it
certainly
not
it
is
the
cause
that
produces
it
if
permanent
and
eternal
which
is
the
only
reality
while
the
other
is
but
a
passing
illusion
enq
all
this
does
not
explain
to
me
how
this
illusion
called
the
universe
originates
how
the
conscious
proceeds
to
manifest
itself
from
the
unconsciousness
that
theo
it
is
only
to
our
finite
consciousness
verily
may
we
paraphrase
verse
v
in
the
chapter
of
john
and
say
absolute
light
which
is
darkness
shineth
in
darkness
which
is
illusionary
material
light
and
the
darkness
comprehendeth
it
this
absolute
light
is
also
absolute
and
immutable
law
whether
by
radiation
or
need
not
quarrel
over
universe
passes
out
of
its
homogeneous
subjectivity
on
to
the
first
plane
of
manifestation
of
which
planes
there
are
seven
we
are
taught
with
each
plane
it
becomes
more
dense
and
material
until
it
reaches
this
our
plane
on
which
the
only
world
approximately
known
and
understood
in
its
physical
composition
by
science
is
the
planetary
or
solar
we
are
told
enq
what
do
you
mean
by
theo
i
mean
that
though
the
fundamental
law
and
the
universal
working
of
laws
of
nature
are
uniform
still
our
solar
system
like
every
other
such
system
in
the
millions
of
others
in
cosmos
and
even
our
earth
has
its
own
programme
of
manifestations
differing
from
the
respective
programmes
of
all
others
we
speak
of
the
inhabitants
of
other
planets
and
imagine
that
if
they
are
thinking
entities
they
must
be
as
we
are
the
fancy
of
poets
and
painters
and
sculptors
never
fails
to
represent
even
the
angels
as
a
beautiful
copy
of
wings
we
say
that
all
this
is
an
error
and
a
delusion
because
if
on
this
little
earth
alone
one
finds
such
a
diversity
in
its
flora
fauna
and
the
seaweed
to
the
cedar
of
lebanon
from
the
to
the
elephant
from
the
bushman
and
negro
to
the
apollo
the
conditions
cosmic
and
planetary
and
there
must
be
as
a
result
quite
a
different
flora
fauna
and
mankind
the
same
laws
will
fashion
quite
a
different
set
of
things
and
beings
even
on
this
our
plane
including
in
it
all
our
planets
how
much
more
different
then
must
be
nature
in
other
solar
systems
and
how
foolish
is
it
to
judge
of
other
and
worlds
and
human
beings
by
our
own
as
physical
science
does
enq
but
what
are
your
data
for
this
assertion
theo
what
science
in
general
will
never
accept
as
cumulative
testimony
of
an
endless
series
of
seers
who
have
testified
to
this
fact
their
spiritual
visions
real
explorations
by
and
through
physical
and
spiritual
senses
untrammeled
by
blind
flesh
were
systematically
checked
and
compared
one
with
the
other
and
their
nature
sifted
all
that
was
not
corroborated
by
unanimous
and
collective
experience
was
rejected
while
that
only
was
recorded
as
established
truth
which
in
various
ages
under
different
climes
and
throughout
an
untold
series
of
incessant
observations
was
found
to
agree
and
receive
constantly
further
corroboration
the
methods
used
by
our
scholars
and
students
of
the
sciences
do
not
differ
from
those
of
students
of
the
natural
and
physical
sciences
as
you
may
see
only
our
fields
of
research
are
on
two
different
planes
and
our
instruments
are
made
by
no
human
hands
for
which
reason
perchance
they
are
only
the
more
reliable
the
retorts
accumulators
and
microscopes
of
the
chemist
and
naturalist
may
get
out
of
order
the
telescope
and
the
horological
instruments
may
get
spoiled
our
recording
instruments
are
beyond
the
influence
of
weather
or
the
elements
enq
and
therefore
you
have
implicit
faith
in
them
theo
faith
is
a
word
not
to
be
found
in
theosophical
dictionaries
we
say
based
on
observation
and
there
is
this
difference
however
that
while
the
observation
and
experience
of
physical
science
lead
the
scientists
to
about
as
many
hypotheses
as
there
are
minds
to
evolve
them
our
consents
to
add
to
its
lore
only
those
facts
which
have
become
undeniable
and
which
are
fully
and
absolutely
demonstrated
we
have
no
two
beliefs
or
hypotheses
on
the
same
subject
enq
is
it
on
such
data
that
you
came
to
accept
the
strange
theories
we
find
in
theo
just
so
these
theories
may
be
slightly
incorrect
in
their
minor
details
and
even
faulty
in
their
exposition
by
lay
students
they
are
in
nature
nevertheless
and
come
nearer
the
truth
than
any
scientific
hypothesis
on
the
septenary
constitution
of
our
planet
enq
i
understand
that
you
describe
our
earth
as
forming
part
of
a
chain
of
earths
theo
we
do
but
the
other
six
or
globes
are
not
on
the
same
plane
of
objectivity
as
our
earth
is
therefore
we
can
not
see
them
enq
is
that
on
account
of
the
great
distance
theo
not
at
all
for
we
see
with
our
naked
eye
planets
and
even
stars
at
immeasurably
greater
distances
but
it
is
owing
to
those
six
globes
being
outside
our
physical
means
of
perception
or
plane
of
being
it
is
not
only
that
their
material
density
weight
or
fabric
are
entirely
different
from
those
of
our
earth
and
the
other
known
planets
but
they
are
to
us
on
an
entirely
different
of
space
so
to
speak
a
layer
not
to
be
perceived
or
felt
by
our
physical
senses
and
when
i
say
please
do
not
allow
your
fancy
to
suggest
to
you
layers
like
strata
or
beds
laid
one
over
the
other
for
this
would
only
lead
to
another
absurd
misconception
what
i
mean
by
is
that
plane
of
infinite
space
which
by
its
nature
can
not
fall
under
our
ordinary
waking
perceptions
whether
mental
or
physical
but
which
exists
in
nature
outside
of
our
normal
mentality
or
consciousness
outside
of
our
three
dimensional
space
and
outside
of
our
division
of
time
each
of
the
seven
fundamental
planes
or
layers
in
course
as
a
whole
as
the
pure
space
of
definition
not
as
our
finite
its
own
objectivity
and
subjectivity
its
own
space
and
time
its
own
consciousness
and
set
of
senses
but
all
this
will
be
hardly
comprehensible
to
one
trained
in
the
modern
ways
of
thought
enq
what
do
you
mean
by
a
different
set
of
senses
is
there
anything
on
our
human
plane
that
you
could
bring
as
an
illustration
of
what
you
say
just
to
give
a
clearer
idea
of
what
you
may
mean
by
this
variety
of
senses
spaces
and
respective
perceptions
theo
none
except
perhaps
that
which
for
science
would
be
rather
a
handy
peg
on
which
to
hang
a
we
have
a
different
set
of
senses
in
have
we
not
we
feel
talk
hear
see
taste
and
function
in

on
a

of
our
consciousness
being
evidenced
by
the
fact
that
a
series
of
acts
and
events
embracing
years
as
we
think
pass
ideally
through
our
mind
in
one
instant
well
that
extreme
rapidity
of
our
mental
operations
in
dreams
and
the
perfect
naturalness
for
the
time
being
of
all
the
other
functions
show
us
that
we
are
on
quite
another
plane
our
philosophy
teaches
us
that
as
there
are
seven
fundamental
forces
in
nature
and
seven
planes
of
being
so
there
are
seven
states
of
consciousness
in
which
man
can
live
think
remember
and
have
his
being
to
enumerate
these
here
is
impossible
and
for
this
one
has
to
turn
to
the
study
of
eastern
metaphysics
but
in
these
two
waking
and
the
ordinary
mortal
from
a
learned
philosopher
down
to
a
poor
untutored
savage
has
a
good
proof
that
such
states
differ
enq
you
do
not
accept
then
the
explanations
of
biology
and
physiology
to
account
for
the
dream
state
theo
we
do
not
we
reject
even
the
hypotheses
of
your
psychologists
preferring
the
teachings
of
eastern
wisdom
believing
in
seven
planes
of
kosmic
being
and
states
of
consciousness
with
regard
to
the
universe
or
the
macrocosm
we
stop
at
the
fourth
plane
finding
it
impossible
to
go
with
any
degree
of
certainty
beyond
but
with
respect
to
the
microcosm
or
man
we
speculate
freely
on
his
seven
states
and
principles
enq
how
do
you
explain
these
theo
we
find
first
of
all
two
distinct
beings
in
man
the
spiritual
and
the
physical
the
man
who
thinks
and
the
man
who
records
as
much
of
these
thoughts
as
he
is
able
to
assimilate
therefore
we
divide
him
into
two
distinct
natures
the
upper
or
the
spiritual
being
composed
of
three
or
and
the
lower
or
the
physical
quaternary
composed
of
all
the
septenary
nature
of
man
enq
is
it
what
we
call
spirit
and
soul
and
the
man
of
flesh
theo
it
is
not
that
is
the
old
platonic
division
plato
was
an
initiate
and
therefore
could
not
go
into
forbidden
details
but
he
who
is
acquainted
with
the
archaic
doctrine
finds
the
seven
in
various
combinations
of
soul
and
spirit
he
regarded
man
as
constituted
of
two
eternal
formed
of
the
same
essence
as
the
absoluteness
the
other
mortal
and
corruptible
deriving
its
constituent
parts
from
the
gods
man
is
composed
he
shows
of
a
mortal
body
an
immortal
principle
and
a
mortal
kind
of
it
is
that
which
we
respectively
call
the
physical
man
the
spiritual
soul
or
spirit
and
the
animal
soul
the
and
this
is
the
division
adopted
by
paul
another
initiate
who
maintains
that
there
is
a
psychical
body
which
is
sown
in
the
corruptible
astral
soul
or
body
and
a
body
that
is
raised
in
incorruptible
substance
even
james
iii
corroborates
the
same
by
saying
that
the
of
our
lower
soul
descendeth
not
from
the
above
but
is
terrestrial
greek
text
while
the
other
is
heavenly
wisdom
now
so
plain
is
it
that
plato
and
even
pythagoras
while
speaking
but
of
three
give
them
seven
separate
functions
in
their
various
combinations
that
if
we
contrast
our
teachings
this
will
become
quite
plain
let
us
take
a
cursory
view
of
these
seven
aspects

what
does
plato
teach
he
speaks
of
the
man
as

of
two
immutable
and
always
the
same
formed
of
the
same
as
deity
and
the
other
mortal
and
corruptible
these
are
found
in
our
upper
and
the
lower
table
he
explains
that
when
the
soul
herself
to
the
nous
divine
spirit
or
substance
she
does
everything
aright
and
but
the
case
is
otherwise
when
she
attaches
herself
to
folly
or
the
irrational
animal
soul
here
then
we
have
or
the
soul
in
general
in
its
two
aspects
when
attaching
itself
to
our
or
the
in
buddhism
it
runs
towards
entire
annihilation
as
far
as
the
personal
ego
is
concerned
when
allying
itself
to
the
it
merges
into
the
immortal
imperishable
ego
and
then
its
spiritual
consciousness
of
the
personal
that
becomes
immortal
the
distinction
between
soul
and
spirit
enq
do
you
really
teach
as
you
are
accused
of
doing
by
some
spiritualists
and
french
spiritists
the
annihilation
of
every
personality
theo
we
do
not
but
as
this
question
of
the
of
the
divine
ego
and
the
of
the
human
that
of
the
possibility
of
the
real
immortal
ego
appearing
in
as
a
spirit
which
we
deny
as
already
explained
our
opponents
have
started
the
nonsensical
charge
enq
you
have
just
spoken
of
running
towards
its
entire
annihilation
if
it
attaches
itself
to
what
did
plato
and
do
you
mean
by
this
theo
the
annihilation
of
the
consciousness
as
an
exceptional
and
rare
case
i
think
the
general
and
almost
invariable
rule
is
the
merging
of
the
personal
into
the
individual
or
immortal
consciousness
of
the
ego
a
transformation
or
a
divine
transfiguration
and
the
entire
annihilation
only
of
the
lower
would
you
expect
the
man
of
flesh
or
the
his
shadow
the
his
animal
instincts
and
even
physical
life
to
survive
with
the
and
become
sempiternal
naturally
all
this
ceases
to
exist
either
at
or
soon
after
corporeal
death
it
becomes
in
time
entirely
disintegrated
and
disappears
from
view
being
annihilated
as
a
whole
enq
then
you
also
reject
in
the
theo
most
decidedly
we
do
why
should
we
who
believe
in
the
archaic
esoteric
philosophy
of
the
ancients
accept
the
unphilosophical
speculations
of
the
later
christian
theology
borrowed
from
the
egyptian
and
greek
exoteric
systems
of
the
gnostics
enq
the
egyptians
revered
and
deified
even
onions
your
hindus
are
to
this
day
the
zoroastrians
worshipped
and
do
still
worship
the
sun
and
the
best
greek
philosophers
were
either
dreamers
or
plato
and
democritus
how
can
you
compare
theo
it
may
be
so
in
your
modern
christian
and
even
scientific
catechism
it
is
not
so
for
unbiased
minds
the
egyptians
revered
the
as
and
it
is
from
this
word
that
anaxagoras
got
his
denomination
or
as
he
calls
it
νους
αυτοχρατης
mind
or
spirit
the
αρχητης
χινηδεως
the
leading
motor
or
of
all
with
him
the
was
god
and
the
was
man
his
emanation
the
is
the
spirit
whether
in
kosmos
or
in
man
and
the
whether
universe
or
astral
body
the
emanation
of
the
former
the
physical
body
being
merely
the
animal
our
external
powers
perceive
our
alone
is
able
to
recognise
their
it
is
the
logos
alone
or
the
that
survives
because
it
is
immortal
in
its
very
nature
and
essence
and
the
in
man
is
the
eternal
ego
that
which
reincarnates
and
lasts
for
ever
but
how
can
the
evanescent
or
external
shadow
the
temporary
clothing
of
that
divine
emanation
which
returns
to
the
source
whence
it
proceeded
be
that
is
raised
in
enq
still
you
can
hardly
escape
the
charge
of
having
invented
a
new
division
of
spiritual
and
psychic
constituents
for
no
philosopher
speaks
of
them
though
you
believe
that
plato
does
theo
and
i
support
the
view
besides
plato
there
is
pythagoras
who
also
followed
the
same
idea
he
described
the
as
a
unit
composed
of
three
elements
the
spirit
the
mind
and
the
life
breath
or
the
of
the
kabalists
which
three
correspond
to
our
higher
to
the
ego
and
to
in
conjunction
with
the
reflection
of
manas
that
which
the
ancient
greek
philosophers
termed
in
general
we
call
spirit
or
spiritual
as
the
vehicle
of
the
or
supreme
deity
the
fact
that
pythagoras
and
others
state
that
and
are
shared
by
us
with
the
brutes
proves
that
in
this
case
the
manasic
reflection
instinct
and
animal
living
passions
are
meant
and
as
socrates
and
plato
accepted
the
clue
and
followed
it
if
to
these
five
namely
deity
or
atma
soul
in
its
collective
sense
spirit
or
mind
physical
mind
and
or
passions
we
add
the
of
the
mysteries
the
shadowy
or
the
human
double
and
the
it
will
be
easy
to
demonstrate
that
the
ideas
of
both
pythagoras
and
plato
were
identical
with
ours
even
the
egyptians
held
to
the
septenary
division
in
its
exit
they
taught
the
soul
ego
had
to
pass
through
its
seven
chambers
or
principles
those
it
left
behind
and
those
it
took
along
with
itself
the
only
difference
is
that
ever
bearing
in
mind
the
penalty
of
revealing
which
was
they
gave
out
the
teaching
in
a
broad
outline
while
we
elaborate
it
and
explain
it
in
its
details
but
though
we
do
give
out
to
the
world
as
much
as
is
lawful
even
in
our
doctrine
more
than
one
important
detail
is
withheld
which
those
who
study
the
esoteric
philosophy
and
are
pledged
to
silence
alone
entitled
to
the
greek
teachings
enq
we
have
magnificent
greek
and
latin
sanskrit
and
hebrew
scholars
how
is
it
that
we
find
nothing
in
their
translations
that
would
afford
us
a
clue
to
what
you
say
theo
because
your
translators
their
great
learning
notwithstanding
have
made
of
the
philosophers
the
greeks
especially
instead
of
mystic
writers
take
as
an
instance
plutarch
and
read
what
he
says
of
of
man
that
which
he
describes
was
accepted
literally
and
attributed
to
metaphysical
superstition
and
ignorance
let
me
give
you
an
illustration
in
point
says
plutarch
compound
and
they
are
who
think
him
to
be
compounded
of
two
parts
for
they
imagine
that
the
understanding
brain
intellect
is
a
part
of
the
soul
the
upper
triad
but
they
err
in
this
no
less
than
those
who
make
the
soul
to
be
a
part
of
the
body
those
who
make
of
the
part
of
the
corruptible
mortal
for
the
understanding
nous
as
far
exceeds
the
soul
as
the
soul
is
better
and
diviner
than
the
body
now
this
composition
of
the
soul
ψυχη
with
the
understanding
νοῦς
makes
reason
and
with
the
body
or
thumos
the
animal
soul
passion
of
which
the
one
is
the
beginning
or
principle
of
pleasure
and
pain
and
the
other
of
virtue
and
vice
of
these
three
parts
conjoined
and
compacted
together
the
earth
has
given
the
body
the
moon
the
soul
and
the
sun
the
understanding
to
the
generation
of
this
last
sentence
is
purely
allegorical
and
will
be
comprehended
only
by
those
who
are
versed
in
the
esoteric
science
of
correspondences
and
know
which
planet
is
to
every
plutarch
divides
the
latter
into
three
groups
and
makes
of
the
body
a
compound
of
physical
frame
astral
shadow
and
breath
or
the
triple
lower
part
which
earth
was
taken
and
to
earth
of
the
middle
principle
and
the
instinctual
soul
the
second
part
derived
and
and
ever
influenced
by
the
moon
and
only
of
the
higher
part
or
the
with
the
atmic
and
manasic
elements
in
it
does
he
make
a
direct
emanation
of
the
sun
who
stands
here
for
the
supreme
deity
this
is
proven
by
what
he
says
further
as
follows
of
the
deaths
we
die
the
one
makes
man
two
of
three
and
the
other
one
of
out
of
two
the
former
is
in
the
region
and
jurisdiction
of
demeter
whence
the
name
given
to
the
mysteries
τελειν
resembled
that
given
to
death
τελευταν
the
athenians
also
heretofore
called
the
deceased
sacred
to
demeter
as
for
the
other
death
it
is
in
the
moon
or
region
of
here
you
have
our
doctrine
which
shows
man
a
during
life
a
just
after
death
in
and
a
threefold
and
consciousness
in
this
separation
first
in
meadows
of
hades
as
plutarch
calls
the
then
in
devachan
was
part
and
parcel
of
the
performances
during
the
sacred
mysteries
when
the
candidates
for
initiation
enacted
the
whole
drama
of
death
and
the
resurrection
as
a
glorified
spirit
by
which
name
we
mean
this
is
what
plutarch
means
when
he
says
as
with
the
one
the
terrestrial
so
with
the
other
celestial
hermes
doth
dwell
this
suddenly
and
with
violence
plucks
the
soul
from
the
body
but
proserpina
mildly
and
in
a
long
time
disjoins
the
understanding
from
the
soul
for
this
reason
she
is
called
only
or
rather
one
for
better
part
of
man
becomes
alone
when
it
is
separated
by
now
both
the
one
and
the
other
happens
thus
according
to
nature
it
is
ordained
by
fate
fatum
or
karma
that
every
soul
whether
with
or
without
understanding
mind
when
gone
out
of
the
body
should
wander
for
a
time
though
not
all
for
the
same
in
the
region
lying
between
the
earth
and
moon
for
those
that
have
been
unjust
and
dissolute
suffer
then
the
punishment
due
to
their
offences
but
the
good
and
virtuous
are
there
detained
till
they
are
purified
and
have
by
expiation
purged
out
of
them
all
the
infections
they
might
have
contracted
from
the
contagion
of
the
body
as
if
from
foul
health
living
in
the
mildest
part
of
the
air
called
the
meadows
of
hades
where
they
must
remain
for
a
certain
prefixed
and
appointed
time
and
then
as
if
they
were
returning
from
a
wandering
pilgrimage
or
long
exile
into
their
country
they
have
a
taste
of
joy
such
as
they
principally
receive
who
are
initiated
into
sacred
mysteries
mixed
with
trouble
admiration
and
each
proper
and
peculiar
this
is
nirvanic
bliss
and
no
theosophist
could
describe
in
plainer
though
esoteric
language
the
mental
joys
of
devachan
where
every
man
has
his
paradise
around
him
erected
by
his
consciousness
but
you
must
beware
of
the
general
error
into
which
too
many
even
of
our
theosophists
fall
do
not
imagine
that
because
man
is
called
septenary
then
and
a
triad
he
is
a
compound
of
seven
five
or
three
or
as
well
expressed
by
a
theosophical
writer
of
skins
to
be
peeled
off
like
the
skins
of
an
onion
the
as
already
said
save
the
body
the
life
and
the
astral
all
of
which
disperse
at
death
are
simply
and
of
there
is
but
one
man
enduring
through
the
cycle
of
life
and
immortal
in
essence
if
not
in
form
and
this
is
the
or
embodied
consciousness
the
objection
made
by
the
materialists
who
deny
the
possibility
of
mind
and
consciousness
acting
without
matter
is
worthless
in
our
case
we
do
not
deny
the
soundness
of
their
argument
but
we
simply
ask
our
opponents
you
acquainted
all
the
states
of
you
who
knew
hitherto
but
of
three
and
how
do
you
know
whether
that
which
we
refer
to
as
absolute
consciousness
or
deity
for
ever
invisible
and
unknowable
be
not
that
which
though
it
eludes
for
ever
our
human
conception
is
still
universal
or
its
absolute
it
is
then
one
of
the
lowest
and
in
its
manvantaric
manifestations
of
this
which
is
the
conscious
that
creates
its
own
paradise
a
paradise
it
may
be
still
a
state
of
bliss
enq
but
what
is
theo
the
of
literally
a
condition
a
state
of
mental
bliss
philosophically
a
mental
condition
analogous
to
but
far
more
vivid
and
real
than
the
most
vivid
dream
it
is
the
state
after
death
of
most
mortals
footnotes
in
and
are
respectively
called
the
animal
the
human
and
the
spiritual
souls
which
answers
as
well
though
the
principles
in
are
numbered
this
is
strictly
speaking
useless
the
dual
alone
is
susceptible
of
being
thought
of
as
the
two
highest
numbers
the
and
as
to
all
others
since
only
which
is
predominant
in
man
has
to
be
considered
as
the
first
and
foremost
no
numeration
is
possible
as
a
general
rule
in
some
men
it
is
the
higher
intelligence
manas
or
the
which
dominates
the
rest
in
others
the
animal
soul
that
reigns
supreme
exhibiting
the
most
bestial
instincts
etc
paul
calls
but
as
this
spirit
is
then
of
course
and
not
is
meant
as
the
latter
can
not
philosophically
be
called
under
any
circumstance
we
include
atma
among
the
human
in
order
not
to
create
additional
confusion
in
reality
it
is
no
but
the
universal
principle
of
which
buddhi
the
is
the
carrier
and
pythagoras
says
plutarch
the
soul
into
two
parts
the
rational
noetic
and
irrational
agnoia
that
that
part
of
the
soul
of
man
which
is
rational
is
eternal
for
though
it
be
not
god
yet
it
is
the
product
of
an
eternal
deity
but
that
part
of
the
soul
which
is
divested
of
reason
agnoia
the
modern
term
comes
from
a
cognate
word
we
wonder
why
huxley
the
author
of
the
word
should
have
connected
his
great
intellect
with
soul
divested
of
which
dies
is
it
the
exaggerated
humility
of
the
modern
materialist
the
kabalists
who
know
the
relation
of
jehovah
the
life
and
to
the
moon
and
the
influence
of
the
latter
on
generation
will
again
see
the
point
as
much
as
some
astrologers
will
proserpina
or
persephone
stands
here
for
post
mortem
karma
which
is
said
to
regulate
the
separation
of
the
lower
from
the
higher
the
as
the
breath
of
animal
life
which
remains
for
a
time
in
from
the
higher
compound
which
goes
into
the
state
of
devachan
or
bliss
until
the
separation
of
the
higher
spiritual
takes
place
from
the
lower
ones
which
remain
in
the
until
disintegrated
vii
on
the
various
post
mortem
states
the
physical
and
the
spiritual
man
enq
i
am
glad
to
hear
you
believe
in
the
immortality
of
the
soul
theo
not
of
soul
but
of
the
divine
spirit
or
rather
in
the
immortality
of
the
reincarnating
ego
enq
what
is
the
difference
theo
a
very
great
one
in
our
philosophy
but
this
is
too
abstruse
and
difficult
a
question
to
touch
lightly
upon
we
shall
have
to
analyse
them
separately
and
then
in
conjunction
we
may
begin
with
spirit
we
say
that
the
spirit
the
in
of
jesus
or
is
no
individual
property
of
any
man
but
is
the
divine
essence
which
has
no
body
no
form
which
is
imponderable
invisible
and
indivisible
that
which
does
not
and
yet
as
the
buddhists
say
of
nirvana
it
only
overshadows
the
mortal
that
which
enters
into
him
and
pervades
the
whole
body
being
only
its
omnipresent
rays
or
light
radiated
through
its
vehicle
and
direct
emanation
this
is
the
secret
meaning
of
the
assertions
of
almost
all
the
ancient
philosophers
when
they
said
that
part
of
never
entered
wholly
into
the
man
but
only
overshadowed
him
more
or
less
through
the
spiritual
soul
or
buddhi
enq
i
laboured
under
the
impression
that
the
alone
was
irrational
not
the
divine
theo
you
have
to
learn
the
difference
between
that
which
is
negatively
or
because
undifferentiated
and
that
which
is
irrational
because
too
and
positive
man
is
a
correlation
of
spiritual
powers
as
well
as
a
correlation
of
chemical
and
physical
forces
brought
into
function
by
what
we
call
enq
i
have
read
a
good
deal
upon
the
subject
and
it
seems
to
me
that
the
notions
of
the
older
philosophers
differed
a
great
deal
from
those
of
the
mediæval
kabalists
though
they
do
agree
in
some
particulars
theo
the
most
substantial
difference
between
them
and
us
is
this
while
we
believe
with
the
and
the
eastern
teachings
that
the
spirit
atma
never
descends
hypostatically
into
the
living
man
but
only
showers
more
or
less
its
radiance
on
the
man
the
psychic
and
spiritual
compound
of
the
principles
the
kabalists
maintain
that
the
human
spirit
detaching
itself
from
the
ocean
of
light
and
universal
spirit
enters
soul
where
it
remains
throughout
life
imprisoned
in
the
astral
capsule
all
christian
kabalists
still
maintain
the
same
as
they
are
unable
to
break
quite
loose
from
their
anthropomorphic
and
biblical
doctrines
enq
and
what
do
you
say
theo
we
say
that
we
only
allow
the
presence
of
the
radiation
of
spirit
or
atma
in
the
astral
capsule
and
so
far
only
as
that
spiritual
radiancy
is
concerned
we
say
that
man
and
soul
have
to
conquer
their
immortality
by
ascending
towards
the
unity
with
which
if
successful
they
will
be
finally
linked
and
into
which
they
are
finally
so
to
speak
absorbed
the
individualization
of
man
after
death
depends
on
the
spirit
not
on
his
soul
and
body
although
the
word
in
the
sense
in
which
it
is
usually
understood
is
an
absurdity
if
applied
literally
to
our
immortal
essence
still
the
latter
is
as
our
individual
ego
a
distinct
entity
immortal
and
eternal
is
only
in
the
case
of
black
magicians
or
of
criminals
beyond
redemption
criminals
who
have
been
such
during
a
long
series
of
the
shining
thread
which
links
the
spirit
to
the
soul
from
the
moment
of
the
birth
of
the
child
is
violently
snapped
and
the
disembodied
entity
becomes
divorced
from
the
personal
soul
the
latter
being
annihilated
without
leaving
the
smallest
impression
of
itself
on
the
former
if
that
union
between
the
lower
or
personal
manas
and
the
individual
reincarnating
ego
has
not
been
effected
during
life
then
the
former
is
left
to
share
the
fate
of
the
lower
animals
to
gradually
dissolve
into
ether
and
have
its
personality
annihilated
but
even
then
the
ego
remains
a
distinct
being
it
the
spiritual
ego
only
loses
one
devachanic
that
special
and
in
that
case
indeed
useless
that
idealized
and
is
reincarnated
after
enjoying
for
a
short
time
its
freedom
as
a
planetary
spirit
almost
immediately
enq
it
is
stated
in
that
such
planetary
spirits
or
angels
gods
of
the
pagans
or
the
archangels
of
the
christians
will
never
be
men
on
our
planet
theo
quite
right
not
but
classes
of
higher
planetary
spirits
they
will
never
be
men
on
this
planet
because
they
are
liberated
spirits
from
a
previous
earlier
world
and
as
such
they
can
not
men
on
this
one
yet
all
these
will
live
again
in
the
next
and
far
higher
mahamanvantara
after
this
age
and
a
little
period
of
figures
or
so
is
over
for
you
must
have
heard
of
course
that
eastern
philosophy
teaches
us
that
mankind
consists
of
such
imprisoned
in
human
bodies
the
difference
between
animals
and
men
is
this
the
former
are
ensouled
by
the
the
latter
do
you
understand
now
the
difference
enq
yes
but
this
specialisation
has
been
in
all
ages
the
of
metaphysicians
theo
it
was
the
whole
esotericism
of
the
buddhistic
philosophy
is
based
on
this
mysterious
teaching
understood
by
so
few
persons
and
so
totally
misrepresented
by
many
of
the
most
learned
modern
scholars
even
metaphysicians
are
too
inclined
to
confound
the
effect
with
the
cause
an
ego
who
has
won
his
immortal
life
as
spirit
will
remain
the
same
inner
self
throughout
all
his
rebirths
on
earth
but
this
does
not
imply
necessarily
that
he
must
either
remain
the
smith
or
brown
he
was
on
earth
or
lose
his
individuality
therefore
the
astral
soul
and
the
terrestrial
body
of
man
may
in
the
dark
hereafter
be
absorbed
into
the
cosmical
ocean
of
sublimated
elements
and
cease
to
feel
his
last
ego
if
it
did
not
deserve
to
soar
higher
and
the
ego
still
remain
the
same
unchanged
entity
though
this
terrestrial
experience
of
his
emanation
may
be
totally
obliterated
at
the
instant
of
separation
from
the
unworthy
vehicle
enq
if
the
or
the
divine
portion
of
the
soul
is
as
a
distinct
being
from
all
eternity
as
origen
synesius
and
other
and
philosophers
taught
and
if
it
is
the
same
and
nothing
more
than
the
soul
how
can
it
be
otherwise
than
eternal
and
what
matters
it
in
such
a
case
whether
man
leads
a
pure
life
or
an
animal
if
do
what
he
may
he
can
never
lose
his
individuality
theo
this
doctrine
as
you
have
stated
it
is
just
as
pernicious
in
its
consequences
as
that
of
vicarious
atonement
had
the
latter
dogma
in
company
with
the
false
idea
that
we
are
all
immortal
been
demonstrated
to
the
world
in
its
true
light
humanity
would
have
been
bettered
by
its
propagation
let
me
repeat
to
you
again
pythagoras
plato
timaeus
of
locris
and
the
old
alexandrian
school
derived
the
of
man
or
his
higher
and
attributes
from
the
universal
world
soul
the
latter
being
according
to
their
teachings
therefore
neither
of
these
can
be
essence
of
the
pythagorean
monas
or
our
because
the
is
but
the
effect
the
subjective
emanation
or
rather
radiation
of
the
former
both
the
spirit
or
the
individuality
the
reincarnating
spiritual
ego
and
buddhi
the
spiritual
soul
are
but
while
the
former
exists
as
a
distinct
entity
an
individualization
the
soul
exists
as
breath
an
unscient
portion
of
an
intelligent
whole
both
were
originally
formed
from
the
eternal
ocean
of
light
but
as
the
the
mediæval
theosophists
expressed
it
there
is
a
visible
as
well
as
invisible
spirit
in
fire
they
made
a
difference
between
the
and
the
empedocles
firmly
believed
all
men
and
animals
to
possess
two
souls
and
in
aristotle
we
find
that
he
calls
one
the
reasoning
soul
νους
and
the
other
the
animal
soul
ψυχη
according
to
these
philosophers
the
reasoning
soul
comes
from
the
universal
soul
and
the
other
from
enq
would
you
call
the
soul
the
human
thinking
soul
or
what
you
call
the
theo
not
matter
but
substance
assuredly
nor
would
the
word
if
prefixed
with
the
adjective
be
a
word
to
avoid
that
matter
we
say
is
with
spirit
and
is
not
our
visible
tangible
and
divisible
matter
but
its
extreme
sublimation
pure
spirit
is
but
one
remove
from
the
or
the
absolute
unless
you
admit
that
man
was
evolved
out
of
this
primordial
and
represents
a
regular
progressive
scale
of
from
down
to
the
grossest
matter
how
can
we
ever
come
to
regard
the
man
as
immortal
and
at
the
same
time
as
a
spiritual
entity
and
a
mortal
man
enq
then
why
should
you
not
believe
in
god
as
such
an
entity
theo
because
that
which
is
infinite
and
unconditioned
can
have
no
form
and
can
not
be
a
being
not
in
any
eastern
philosophy
worthy
of
the
name
at
any
rate
an
is
immortal
but
is
so
only
in
its
ultimate
essence
not
in
its
individual
form
when
at
the
last
point
of
its
cycle
it
is
absorbed
into
its
primordial
nature
and
it
becomes
spirit
when
it
loses
its
name
of
entity
its
immortality
as
a
form
is
limited
only
to
its
or
the
after
which
it
is
one
and
identical
with
the
universal
spirit
and
no
longer
a
separate
entity
as
to
the
which
we
mean
the
spark
of
consciousness
that
preserves
in
the
spiritual
ego
the
idea
of
the
personal
of
the
last
lasts
as
a
separate
distinct
recollection
only
throughout
the
devachanic
period
after
which
time
it
is
added
to
the
series
of
other
innumerable
incarnations
of
the
ego
like
the
remembrance
in
our
memory
of
one
of
a
series
of
days
at
the
end
of
a
year
will
you
bind
the
infinitude
you
claim
for
your
god
to
finite
conditions
that
alone
which
is
indissolubly
cemented
by
is
immortal
the
soul
of
man
of
the
personality
is
neither
immortal
eternal
nor
divine
says
the
vol
soul
when
sent
to
this
earth
puts
on
an
earthly
garment
to
preserve
herself
here
so
she
receives
above
a
shining
garment
in
order
to
be
able
to
look
without
injury
into
the
mirror
whose
light
proceeds
from
the
lord
of
moreover
the
teaches
that
the
soul
can
not
reach
the
abode
of
bliss
unless
she
has
received
the
kiss
or
the
reunion
of
the
soul
the
substance
from
which
she
all
souls
are
dual
and
while
the
latter
is
a
feminine
principle
the
spirit
is
masculine
while
imprisoned
in
body
man
is
a
trinity
unless
his
pollution
is
such
as
to
have
caused
his
divorce
from
the
spirit
to
the
soul
which
prefers
to
her
divine
husband
spirit
the
earthly
wedlock
with
her
terrestrial
body
records
a
text
of
the
of
the
a
hermetic
work
woe
indeed
for
nothing
will
remain
of
that
personality
to
be
recorded
on
the
imperishable
tablets
of
the
memory
enq
how
can
that
which
if
not
breathed
by
god
into
man
yet
is
on
your
own
confession
of
an
identical
substance
with
the
divine
fail
to
be
immortal
theo
every
atom
and
speck
of
matter
not
of
substance
only
is
in
its
essence
but
not
in
its
immortality
is
but
unbroken
consciousness
and
the
consciousness
can
hardly
last
longer
than
the
personality
itself
can
it
and
such
consciousness
as
i
already
told
you
survives
only
throughout
devachan
after
which
it
is
reabsorbed
first
in
the
and
then
in
the
consciousness
better
enquire
of
your
theologians
how
it
is
that
they
have
so
sorely
jumbled
up
the
jewish
scriptures
read
the
bible
if
you
would
have
a
good
proof
that
the
writers
of
the
and
especially
never
regarded
that
which
god
breathes
into
adam
ch
ii
as
the
soul
here
are
some
instances
god
created
every
life
that
gen
i
meaning
animals
and
ii
it
is
said
man
became
a
living
soul
which
shows
that
the
word
was
indifferently
applied
to
man
and
to
beast
surely
your
blood
of
your
lives
will
i
require
at
the
hand
of
every
beast
will
i
require
it
and
at
the
hand
of

it
is
translated
xix
us
not
kill

reads
the
english
version
xxxvii
us
not
kill
his
is
the
hebrew
text
for
says
leviticus
xvii
that
killeth
any
man
shall
surely
be
put
to
death
literally
that
smiteth
the

xxiv
and
from
verse
and
following
it
reads
he
that
killeth
a
beast
shall
make

good
beast
for
beast
whereas
the
original
text
has
it
for
how
could
man
that
which
is
immortal
and
this
explains
also
why
the
sadducees
denied
the
immortality
of
the
soul
as
it
also
affords
another
proof
that
very
probably
the
mosaic
uninitiated
at
any
believed
in
the
survival
at
all
on
eternal
reward
and
punishment
and
on
nirvana
enq
it
is
hardly
necessary
i
suppose
to
ask
you
whether
you
believe
in
the
christian
dogmas
of
paradise
and
hell
or
in
future
rewards
and
punishments
as
taught
by
the
orthodox
churches
theo
as
described
in
your
catechisms
we
reject
them
absolutely
least
of
all
would
we
accept
their
eternity
but
we
believe
firmly
in
what
we
call
the
of
and
in
the
absolute
justice
and
wisdom
guiding
this
law
or
karma
hence
we
positively
refuse
to
accept
the
cruel
and
unphilosophical
belief
in
eternal
reward
or
eternal
punishment
we
say
with
horace
rules
be
fixed
that
may
our
rage
contain
and
punish
faults
a
but
do
not
flay
him
who
deserves
alone
a
whipping
for
the
fault
that
he
has
this
is
a
rule
for
all
men
and
a
just
one
have
we
to
believe
that
god
of
whom
you
make
the
embodiment
of
wisdom
love
and
mercy
is
less
entitled
to
these
attributes
than
mortal
man
enq
have
you
any
other
reasons
for
rejecting
this
dogma
theo
our
chief
reason
for
it
lies
in
the
fact
of
as
already
stated
we
reject
the
idea
of
a
new
soul
created
for
every
babe
we
believe
that
every
human
being
is
the
bearer
or
of
an
coeval
with
every
other
ego
because
all
are
the
same
and
belong
to
the
primeval
emanation
from
one
universal
infinite
plato
calls
the
latter
the
or
the
second
manifested
god
and
we
the
manifested
divine
principle
which
is
one
with
the
universal
mind
or
soul
not
the
anthropomorphic
and
god
in
which
so
many
theists
believe
pray
do
not
confuse
enq
but
where
is
the
difficulty
once
you
accept
a
manifested
principle
in
believing
that
the
soul
of
every
new
mortal
is
by
that
principle
as
all
the
souls
before
it
have
been
so
created
theo
because
that
which
is
can
hardly
create
plan
and
think
at
its
own
sweet
will
and
pleasure
being
a
universal
immutable
in
its
periodical
manifestations
those
of
radiating
and
manifesting
its
own
essence
at
the
beginning
of
every
new
cycle
of
life
it
is
not
supposed
to
create
men
only
to
repent
a
few
years
later
of
having
created
them
if
we
have
to
believe
in
a
divine
principle
at
all
it
must
be
in
one
which
is
as
absolute
harmony
logic
and
justice
as
it
is
absolute
love
wisdom
and
impartiality
and
a
god
who
would
every
soul
for
the
space
of
brief
span
of
regardless
of
the
fact
whether
it
has
to
animate
the
body
of
a
wealthy
happy
man
or
that
of
a
poor
suffering
wretch
hapless
from
birth
to
death
though
he
has
done
nothing
to
deserve
his
cruel
be
rather
a
senseless
than
a
god
the
punishment
of
the
why
even
the
jewish
philosophers
believers
in
the
mosaic
bible
esoterically
of
course
have
never
entertained
such
an
idea
and
moreover
they
believed
in
as
we
do
enq
can
you
give
me
some
instances
as
a
proof
of
this
theo
most
decidedly
i
can
philo
judæus
says
in
somniis
air
is
full
of
them
of
souls
those
which
are
nearest
the
earth
descending
to
be
tied
to
mortal
bodies
παλινδρομοῦσιν
αὖθις
to
other
bodies
being
desirous
to
live
in
in
the
the
soul
is
made
to
plead
her
freedom
before
god
of
the
universe
i
am
happy
in
this
world
and
do
not
wish
to
go
into
another
world
where
i
shall
be
a
handmaid
and
be
exposed
to
all
kinds
of
the
doctrine
of
fatal
necessity
the
everlasting
immutable
law
is
asserted
in
the
answer
of
the
deity
thy
will
thou
becomest
an
embryo
and
against
thy
will
thou
art
light
would
be
incomprehensible
without
darkness
to
make
it
manifest
by
contrast
good
would
be
no
longer
good
without
evil
to
show
the
priceless
nature
of
the
boon
and
so
personal
virtue
could
claim
no
merit
unless
it
had
passed
through
the
furnace
of
temptation
nothing
is
eternal
and
unchangeable
save
the
concealed
deity
nothing
that
is
because
it
had
a
beginning
or
must
have
an
remain
stationary
it
must
either
progress
or
recede
and
a
soul
which
thirsts
after
a
reunion
with
its
spirit
which
alone
confers
upon
it
immortality
must
purify
itself
through
cyclic
transmigrations
onward
toward
the
only
land
of
bliss
and
eternal
rest
called
in
the
palace
of
love
היבל
אחכה
in
the
hindu
religion
among
the
gnostics
pleroma
of
eternal
and
by
the
buddhists
and
all
these
states
are
temporary
not
eternal
enq
yet
there
is
no
spoken
of
in
all
this
theo
a
soul
which
pleads
to
be
allowed
to
remain
where
she
is
be
and
not
have
been
created
for
the
occasion
in
the
vol
however
there
is
a
still
better
proof
speaking
of
the
reincarnating
the
souls
those
whose
last
personality
has
to
fade
out
it
is
said
souls
which
have
alienated
themselves
in
heaven
from
the
holy
be
his
thrown
themselves
into
an
abyss
at
their
very
existence
and
have
anticipated
the
time
when
they
are
to
descend
once
more
on
holy
means
here
esoterically
the
atman
or
enq
moreover
it
is
very
strange
to
find
spoken
of
as
something
synonymous
with
the
kingdom
of
heaven
or
the
paradise
since
according
to
every
orientalist
of
note
nirvana
is
a
synonym
of
annihilation
theo
taken
literally
with
regard
to
the
personality
and
differentiated
matter
not
otherwise
these
ideas
on
and
the
trinity
of
man
were
held
by
many
of
the
early
christian
fathers
it
is
the
jumble
made
by
the
translators
of
the
new
testament
and
ancient
philosophical
treatises
between
soul
and
spirit
that
has
occasioned
the
many
misunderstandings
it
is
also
one
of
the
many
reasons
why
buddha
plotinus
and
so
many
other
initiates
are
now
accused
of
having
longed
for
the
total
extinction
of
their
souls
unto
the
deity
or
with
the
universal
soul
meaning
according
to
modern
ideas
annihilation
the
personal
soul
must
of
course
be
disintegrated
into
its
particles
before
it
is
able
to
link
its
purer
essence
for
ever
with
the
immortal
spirit
but
the
translators
of
both
the
and
the
who
laid
the
foundation
of
the
of
and
the
modern
commentators
on
the
buddhist
of
the
foundation
of
the
kingdom
of
have
muddled
the
sense
of
the
great
apostle
of
christianity
as
of
the
great
reformer
of
india
the
former
have
smothered
the
word
ψυχικος
so
that
no
reader
imagines
it
to
have
any
relation
with
and
with
this
confusion
of
and
together
readers
get
only
a
perverted
sense
of
anything
on
the
subject
on
the
other
hand
the
interpreters
of
buddha
have
failed
to
understand
the
meaning
and
object
of
the
buddhist
four
degrees
of
dhyâna
ask
the
pythagoreans
that
spirit
which
gives
life
and
motion
and
partakes
of
the
nature
of
light
be
reduced
to
nonentity
even
that
sensitive
spirit
in
brutes
which
exercises
memory
one
of
the
rational
faculties
die
and
become
nothing
observe
the
occultists
in
buddhistic
philosophy
means
only
a
dispersion
of
matter
in
whatever
form
or
of
form
it
may
be
for
everything
that
has
form
is
temporary
and
is
therefore
really
an
illusion
for
in
eternity
the
longest
periods
of
time
are
as
a
wink
of
the
eye
so
with
form
before
we
have
time
to
realize
that
we
have
seen
it
it
is
gone
like
an
instantaneous
flash
of
lightning
and
passed
for
ever
when
the
spiritual
breaks
loose
for
ever
from
every
particle
of
matter
substance
or
form
and
a
spiritual
breath
then
only
does
it
enter
upon
the
eternal
and
unchangeable
lasting
as
long
as
the
cycle
of
life
has
eternity
truly
and
then
that
breath
existing
is
because
it
is
as
a
form
a
semblance
a
shape
it
is
completely
annihilated
as
absolute
spirit
it
still
is
for
it
has
become
itself
the
very
word
used
in
the
universal
essence
when
spoken
of
the
as
spirit
means
it
can
never
mean
annihilation
as
that
would
mean
eternal
separation
enq
do
you
not
lay
yourself
open
to
the
accusation
of
preaching
annihilation
by
the
language
you
yourself
use
you
have
just
spoken
of
the
soul
of
man
returning
to
its
primordial
elements
theo
but
you
forget
that
i
have
given
you
the
differences
between
the
various
meanings
of
the
word
and
shown
the
loose
way
in
which
the
term
has
been
hitherto
translated
we
speak
of
an
a
and
a
soul
and
distinguish
between
them
plato
for
instance
calls
that
which
we
call
adding
to
it
the
adjective
of
however
but
that
which
we
call
the
reincarnating
ego
he
calls
spirit
whereas
we
apply
the
term
when
standing
alone
and
without
any
qualification
to
atma
alone
pythagoras
repeats
our
archaic
doctrine
when
stating
that
the
is
eternal
with
deity
that
the
soul
only
passed
through
various
stages
to
arrive
at
divine
excellence
while
returned
to
the
earth
and
even
the
the
lower
was
eliminated
again
plato
defines
buddhi
as
motion
that
is
able
to
move
he
adds
laws
x
the
most
ancient
of
all
things
and
the
commencement
of
motion
thus
calling
and
which
we
do
not
was
generated
prior
to
body
and
body
is
posterior
and
secondary
as
being
according
to
nature
ruled
over
by
the
ruling
soul
which
administers
all
things
that
are
moved
in
every
way
administers
likewise
the
then
leads
everything
in
heaven
and
on
earth
and
in
the
sea
by
its
names
of
which
are
to
will
to
consider
to
take
care
of
to
consult
to
form
opinions
true
and
false
to
be
in
a
state
of
joy
sorrow
confidence
fear
hate
love
together
with
all
such
primary
movements
as
are
allied
to
these
being
a
goddess
herself
she
ever
takes
as
an
ally
a
god
and
disciplines
all
things
correctly
and
happily
but
when
with
works
out
everything
the
in
this
language
as
in
the
buddhist
texts
the
negative
is
treated
as
essential
existence
comes
under
a
similar
exegesis
the
positive
state
is
essential
being
but
no
manifestation
as
such
when
the
spirit
in
buddhistic
parlance
enters
it
loses
objective
existence
but
retains
subjective
being
to
objective
minds
this
is
becoming
absolute
to
subjective
nothing
to
be
displayed
to
sense
thus
their
nirvana
means
the
certitude
of
individual
immortality
not
in
soul
which
though
most
ancient
of
all
things
is
with
all
the
other
finite
emanation
in
and
individuality
if
not
in
substance
enq
i
do
not
quite
seize
the
idea
yet
and
would
be
thankful
to
have
you
explain
this
to
me
by
some
illustrations
theo
no
doubt
it
is
very
difficult
to
understand
especially
to
one
brought
up
in
the
regular
orthodox
ideas
of
the
christian
church
moreover
i
must
tell
you
one
thing
and
this
is
that
unless
you
have
studied
thoroughly
well
the
separate
functions
assigned
to
all
the
human
and
the
state
of
all
these
you
will
hardly
realize
our
eastern
philosophy
on
the
various
in
man
enq
i
have
heard
a
good
deal
about
this
constitution
of
the
as
you
call
it
but
could
never
make
or
tail
as
gabalis
expresses
it
theo
of
course
it
is
most
difficult
and
as
you
say
to
understand
correctly
and
distinguish
between
the
various
called
by
us
the
of
the
real
ego
it
is
the
more
so
as
there
exists
a
notable
difference
in
the
numbering
of
those
principles
by
various
eastern
schools
though
at
the
bottom
there
is
the
same
identical
substratum
of
teaching
enq
do
you
mean
the
vedantins
as
an
instance
they
divide
your
seven
into
five
only
theo
they
do
but
though
i
would
not
presume
to
dispute
the
point
with
a
learned
vedantin
i
may
yet
state
as
my
private
opinion
that
they
have
an
obvious
reason
for
it
with
them
it
is
only
that
compound
spiritual
aggregate
which
consists
of
various
mental
aspects
that
is
called
at
all
the
physical
body
being
in
their
view
something
beneath
contempt
and
merely
an
nor
is
the
vedanta
the
only
philosophy
to
reckon
in
this
manner
in
his
mentions
only
five
principles
because
he
like
the
vedantins
omits
to
include
two
principles
namely
the
spirit
atma
and
the
physical
body
the
latter
of
which
moreover
he
calls
then
there
is
the
rajà
school
its
teaching
recognises
only
three
in
fact
but
then
in
reality
their
or
the
physical
body
in
its
waking
conscious
state
their
the
same
body
in
or
the
dreaming
state
and
their
or
body
or
that
which
passes
from
one
incarnation
to
another
are
all
dual
in
their
aspects
and
thus
make
six
add
to
this
atma
the
impersonal
divine
principle
or
the
immortal
element
in
man
undistinguished
from
the
universal
spirit
and
you
have
the
same
seven
again
they
are
welcome
to
hold
to
their
division
we
hold
to
ours
enq
then
it
seems
almost
the
same
as
the
division
made
by
the
mystic
christians
body
soul
and
spirit
theo
just
the
same
we
could
easily
make
of
the
body
the
vehicle
of
the
of
the
latter
the
vehicle
of
life
or
of
or
animal
soul
the
vehicle
of
the
and
the
mind
and
make
of
this
six
principles
crowning
the
whole
with
the
one
immortal
spirit
in
occultism
every
qualificative
change
in
the
state
of
our
consciousness
gives
to
man
a
new
aspect
and
if
it
prevails
and
becomes
part
of
the
living
and
acting
ego
it
must
be
and
is
given
a
special
name
to
distinguish
the
man
in
that
particular
state
from
the
man
he
is
when
he
places
himself
in
another
state
enq
it
is
just
that
which
it
is
so
difficult
to
understand
theo
it
seems
to
me
very
easy
on
the
contrary
once
that
you
have
seized
the
main
idea
that
man
acts
on
this
or
another
plane
of
consciousness
in
strict
accordance
with
his
mental
and
spiritual
condition
but
such
is
the
materialism
of
the
age
that
the
more
we
explain
the
less
people
seem
capable
of
understanding
what
we
say
divide
the
terrestrial
being
called
man
into
three
chief
aspects
if
you
like
and
unless
you
make
of
him
a
pure
animal
you
can
not
do
less
take
his
objective
the
thinking
principle
in
is
only
a
little
higher
than
the
element
in
the
the
vital
conscious
soul
and
that
which
places
him
so
immeasurably
beyond
and
higher
than
the
his
soul
or
well
if
we
take
these
three
groups
or
representative
entities
and
subdivide
them
according
to
the
occult
teaching
what
do
we
get
first
of
all
spirit
in
the
sense
of
the
absolute
and
therefore
indivisible
all
or
atma
as
this
can
neither
be
located
nor
limited
in
philosophy
being
simply
that
which
is
in
eternity
and
which
can
not
be
absent
from
even
the
tiniest
geometrical
or
mathematical
point
of
the
universe
of
matter
or
substance
it
ought
not
to
be
called
in
truth
a
principle
at
all
rather
and
at
best
it
is
in
metaphysics
that
point
in
space
which
the
human
monad
and
its
vehicle
man
occupy
for
the
period
of
every
life
now
that
point
is
as
imaginary
as
man
himself
and
in
reality
is
an
illusion
a
but
then
for
ourselves
as
for
other
personal
egos
we
are
a
reality
during
that
fit
of
illusion
called
life
and
we
have
to
take
ourselves
into
account
in
our
own
fancy
at
any
rate
if
no
one
else
does
to
make
it
more
conceivable
to
the
human
intellect
when
first
attempting
the
study
of
occultism
and
to
solve
the
a
b
c
of
the
mystery
of
man
occultism
calls
this
principle
the
synthesis
of
the
sixth
and
gives
it
for
vehicle
the
soul
now
the
latter
conceals
a
mystery
which
is
never
given
to
any
one
with
the
exception
of
irrevocably
pledged
or
those
at
any
rate
who
can
be
safely
trusted
of
course
there
would
be
less
confusion
could
it
only
be
told
but
as
this
is
directly
concerned
with
the
power
of
projecting
double
consciously
and
at
will
and
as
this
gift
like
the
of
gyges
would
prove
very
fatal
to
man
at
large
and
to
the
possessor
of
that
faculty
in
particular
it
is
carefully
guarded
but
let
us
proceed
with
the
this
divine
soul
or
buddhi
then
is
the
vehicle
of
the
spirit
in
conjunction
these
two
are
one
impersonal
and
without
any
attributes
on
this
plane
of
course
and
make
two
spiritual
if
we
pass
on
to
the
soul
or
every
one
will
agree
that
the
intelligence
of
man
is
to
say
the
least
the
man
can
hardly
become
the
very
intellectual
and
man
is
separated
by
an
abyss
from
the
obtuse
dull
and
material
if
not
man
enq
but
why
should
not
man
be
represented
by
two
or
two
aspects
rather
theo
every
man
has
these
two
principles
in
him
one
more
active
than
the
other
and
in
rare
cases
one
of
these
is
entirely
stunted
in
its
growth
so
to
say
or
paralysed
by
the
strength
and
predominance
of
the
other
in
whatever
direction
these
then
are
what
we
call
the
two
principles
or
aspects
of
the
higher
and
the
lower
the
former
the
higher
manas
or
the
thinking
conscious
ego
gravitating
toward
the
spiritual
soul
buddhi
and
the
latter
or
its
instinctual
principle
attracted
to
the
seat
of
animal
desires
and
passions
in
man
thus
we
have
justified
the
last
three
being
the
which
we
have
agreed
to
call
protean
or
plastic
soul
the
vehicle
of
the
life
and
the
physical
body
of
course
no
physiologist
or
biologist
will
accept
these
principles
nor
can
he
make
head
or
tail
of
them
and
this
is
why
perhaps
none
of
them
understand
to
this
day
either
the
functions
of
the
spleen
the
physical
vehicle
of
the
protean
double
or
those
of
a
certain
organ
on
the
right
side
of
man
the
seat
of
the
desires
nor
yet
does
he
know
anything
of
the
pineal
gland
which
he
describes
as
a
horny
gland
with
a
little
sand
in
it
which
gland
is
in
truth
the
very
seat
of
the
highest
and
divinest
consciousness
in
man
his
omniscient
spiritual
and
mind
and
this
shows
to
you
still
more
plainly
that
we
have
neither
invented
these
seven
principles
nor
are
they
new
in
the
world
of
philosophy
as
we
can
easily
prove
enq
but
what
is
it
that
reincarnates
in
your
belief
theo
the
spiritual
thinking
ego
the
permanent
principle
in
man
or
that
which
is
the
seat
of
it
is
not
atma
or
even
regarded
as
the
dual
which
is
the
or
man
but
manas
for
atman
is
the
universal
all
and
becomes
the
of
man
only
in
conjunction
with
its
vehicle
which
links
it
to
the
individuality
or
divine
man
for
it
is
the
which
is
called
the
the
united
and
principles
and
which
is
that
connects
it
with
every
personality
it
inhabits
on
earth
therefore
soul
being
a
generic
term
there
are
in
men
three
of
terrestrial
or
animal
the
human
soul
and
the
spiritual
soul
these
strictly
speaking
are
one
soul
in
its
three
aspects
now
of
the
first
aspect
nothing
remains
after
death
of
the
second
or
manas
only
its
divine
essence
left
survives
while
the
third
in
addition
to
being
immortal
becomes
divine
by
the
assimilation
of
the
higher
manas
but
to
make
it
clear
we
have
to
say
a
few
words
first
of
all
about
enq
you
will
do
well
as
it
is
against
this
doctrine
that
your
enemies
fight
the
most
ferociously
theo
you
mean
the
spiritualists
i
know
and
many
are
the
absurd
objections
laboriously
spun
by
them
over
the
pages
of
so
obtuse
and
malicious
are
some
of
them
that
they
will
stop
at
nothing
one
of
them
found
recently
a
contradiction
which
he
gravely
discusses
in
a
letter
to
that
journal
in
two
statements
picked
out
of
lectures
he
discovers
that
grave
contradiction
in
these
two
sentences
returns
to
in
the
cases
when
they
occur
may
be
due
to
karmic
complication
and
is
no
in
the
supreme
act
of
divine
justice
guiding
so
profound
a
thinker
would
surely
see
a
contradiction
of
the
law
of
gravitation
if
a
man
stretched
out
his
hand
to
stop
a
falling
stone
from
crushing
the
head
of
a
child
footnotes
in
its
generic
sense
the
word
meaning
something
emanating
from
the
eternal
wisdom
in
the
sense
that
as
a
emanation
of
the
universal
mind
it
can
have
no
individual
reason
of
its
own
on
this
plane
of
matter
but
like
the
moon
who
borrows
her
light
from
the
sun
and
her
life
from
the
earth
so
receiving
its
light
of
wisdom
from
atma
gets
its
rational
qualities
from
as
something
homogeneous
it
is
devoid
of
attributes

what
is
memory
according
to
theosophical
teaching
enq
the
most
difficult
thing
for
you
to
do
will
be
to
explain
and
give
reasonable
grounds
for
such
a
belief
no
theosophist
has
ever
yet
succeeded
in
bringing
forward
a
single
valid
proof
to
shake
my
scepticism
first
of
all
you
have
against
this
theory
of
the
fact
that
no
single
man
has
yet
been
found
to
remember
that
he
has
lived
least
of
all
who
he
was
during
his
previous
life
theo
your
argument
i
see
tends
to
the
same
old
objection
the
loss
of
memory
in
each
of
us
of
our
previous
incarnation
you
think
it
invalidates
our
doctrine
my
answer
is
that
it
does
not
and
that
at
any
rate
such
an
objection
can
not
be
final
enq
i
would
like
to
hear
your
arguments
theo
they
are
short
and
few
yet
when
you
take
into
consideration
the
utter
inability
of
the
best
modern
psychologists
to
explain
to
the
world
the
nature
of
and
their
complete
ignorance
of
its
potentialities
and
higher
states
you
have
to
admit
that
this
objection
is
based
on
an
conclusion
drawn
from
and
circumstantial
evidence
more
than
anything
else
now
what
is
in
your
conception
pray
enq
that
which
is
generally
accepted
the
faculty
in
our
mind
of
remembering
and
of
retaining
the
knowledge
of
previous
thoughts
deeds
and
events
theo
please
add
to
it
that
there
is
a
great
difference
between
the
three
accepted
forms
of
memory
besides
memory
in
general
you
have
and
have
you
not
have
you
ever
thought
over
the
difference
memory
remember
is
a
generic
name
enq
yet
all
these
are
only
synonyms
theo
indeed
they
are
in
philosophy
at
all
events
memory
is
simply
an
innate
power
in
thinking
beings
and
even
in
animals
of
reproducing
past
impressions
by
an
association
of
ideas
principally
suggested
by
objective
things
or
by
some
action
on
our
external
sensory
organs
memory
is
a
faculty
depending
entirely
on
the
more
or
less
healthy
and
normal
functioning
of
our
brain
and
and
are
the
attributes
and
handmaidens
of
that
memory
but
is
an
entirely
different
thing
is
defined
by
the
modern
psychologist
as
something
intermediate
between
and
or
conscious
process
of
recalling
past
occurrences
but
that
full
and
varied
to
particular
things
which
characterises
locke
speaking
of
recollection
and
remembrance
says
an
recurs
without
the
operation
of
the
like
object
on
the
external
sensory
it
is
if
it
be
sought
after
by
the
mind
and
with
pain
and
endeavour
found
and
brought
again
into
view
it
is
but
even
locke
leaves
without
any
clear
definition
because
it
is
no
faculty
or
attribute
of
our
memory
but
an
intuitional
perception
apart
from
and
outside
our
physical
brain
a
perception
which
covering
as
it
does
being
called
into
action
by
the
knowledge
of
our
spiritual
ego
all
those
visions
in
man
which
are
regarded
as
the
pictures
suggested
by
genius
to
the
of
fever
and
even
classed
by
science
as
having
no
outside
of
our
fancy
occultism
and
theosophy
however
regard
in
an
entirely
different
light
for
us
while
is
physical
and
evanescent
and
depends
on
the
physiological
conditions
of
the
fundamental
proposition
with
all
teachers
of
mnemonics
who
have
the
researches
of
modern
scientific
psychologists
to
back
call
the
of
the
and
it
is
memory
which
gives
the
assurance
to
almost
every
human
being
whether
he
understands
it
or
not
of
his
having
lived
before
and
having
to
live
again
indeed
as
wordsworth
has
it
birth
is
but
a
sleep
and
a
forgetting
the
soul
that
rises
with
us
our
star
hath
elsewhere
had
its
setting
and
cometh
from
enq
if
it
is
on
this
kind
of
and
abnormal
fancies
on
your
own
you
base
your
doctrine
then
you
will
convince
very
few
i
am
afraid
theo
i
did
not
it
was
a
fancy
i
simply
said
that
physiologists
and
scientists
in
general
regard
such
reminiscences
as
hallucinations
and
fancy
to
which
conclusion
they
are
welcome
we
do
not
deny
that
such
visions
of
the
past
and
glimpses
far
back
into
the
corridors
of
time
are
abnormal
as
contrasted
with
our
normal
daily
life
experience
and
physical
memory
but
we
do
maintain
with
professor
knight
that
absence
of
memory
of
any
action
done
in
a
previous
state
can
not
be
a
conclusive
argument
against
our
having
lived
through
and
every
opponent
must
agree
with
what
is
said
in
on
platonic
the
feeling
of
extravagance
with
which
it
affects
us
has
its
secret
source
in
materialistic
or
besides
which
we
maintain
that
memory
as
olympiodorus
called
it
is
simply
and
the
most
unreliable
thing
in
us
ammonius
saccas
asserted
that
the
only
faculty
in
man
directly
opposed
to
prognostication
or
looking
into
futurity
is
furthermore
remember
that
memory
is
one
thing
and
mind
or
is
another
one
is
a
recording
machine
a
register
which
very
easily
gets
out
of
order
the
other
thoughts
are
eternal
and
imperishable
would
you
refuse
to
believe
in
the
existence
of
certain
things
or
men
only
because
your
physical
eyes
have
not
seen
them
would
not
the
collective
testimony
of
past
generations
who
have
seen
him
be
a
sufficient
guarantee
that
julius
cæsar
once
lived
why
should
not
the
same
testimony
of
the
psychic
senses
of
the
masses
be
taken
into
consideration
enq
but
you
think
that
these
are
too
fine
distinctions
to
be
accepted
by
the
majority
of
mortals
theo
say
rather
by
the
majority
of
materialists
and
to
them
we
say
behold
even
in
the
short
span
of
ordinary
existence
memory
is
too
weak
to
register
all
the
events
of
a
lifetime
how
frequently
do
even
most
important
events
lie
dormant
in
our
memory
until
awakened
by
some
association
of
ideas
or
aroused
to
function
and
activity
by
some
other
link
this
is
especially
the
case
with
people
of
advanced
age
who
are
always
found
suffering
from
feebleness
of
recollection
when
therefore
we
remember
that
which
we
know
about
the
physical
and
the
spiritual
principles
in
man
it
is
not
the
fact
that
our
memory
has
failed
to
record
our
precedent
life
and
lives
that
ought
to
surprise
us
but
the
contrary
were
it
to
happen
why
do
we
not
remember
our
past
lives
enq
you
have
given
me
a
eye
view
of
the
seven
principles
now
how
do
they
account
for
our
complete
loss
of
any
recollection
of
having
lived
before
theo
very
easily
since
those
which
we
call
physical
and
none
of
which
is
denied
by
science
though
it
calls
them
by
other
names
are
disintegrated
after
death
with
their
constituent
elements
along
with
its
brain
this
vanished
memory
of
a
vanished
personality
can
neither
remember
nor
record
anything
in
the
subsequent
of
the
ego
means
that
this
ego
will
be
furnished
with
a
body
a
brain
and
a
memory
therefore
it
would
be
as
absurd
to
expect
this
to
remember
that
which
it
has
never
recorded
as
it
would
be
idle
to
examine
under
a
microscope
a
shirt
never
worn
by
a
murderer
and
seek
on
it
for
the
stains
of
blood
which
are
to
be
found
only
on
the
clothes
he
wore
it
is
not
the
clean
shirt
that
we
have
to
question
but
the
clothes
worn
during
the
perpetration
of
the
crime
and
if
these
are
burnt
and
destroyed
how
can
you
get
at
them
enq
aye
how
can
you
get
at
the
certainty
that
the
crime
was
ever
committed
at
all
or
that
the
in
the
clean
ever
lived
before
theo
not
by
physical
processes
most
assuredly
nor
by
relying
on
the
testimony
of
that
which
exists
no
longer
but
there
is
such
a
thing
as
circumstantial
evidence
since
our
wise
laws
accept
it
more
perhaps
even
than
they
should
to
get
convinced
of
the
fact
of
and
past
lives
one
must
put
oneself
in
with
real
permanent
ego
not
evanescent
memory
enq
but
how
can
people
believe
in
that
which
they
not
nor
have
ever
seen
far
less
put
themselves
in
with
it
theo
if
people
and
the
most
learned
will
believe
in
the
gravity
ether
force
and
what
not
of
science
abstractions
working
hypotheses
which
they
have
neither
seen
touched
smelt
heard
nor
should
not
other
people
believe
on
the
same
principle
in
permanent
ego
a
far
more
logical
and
important
than
any
other
enq
what
is
finally
this
mysterious
eternal
principle
can
you
explain
its
nature
so
as
to
make
it
comprehensible
to
all
theo
the
ego
which
reincarnates
the
and
the
vehicle
in
short
of
the
monad
that
which
is
rewarded
in
devachan
and
punished
on
earth
and
that
finally
to
which
the
reflection
only
of
the
or
attributes
of
every
incarnation
attaches
itself
enq
what
do
you
mean
by
theo
just
what
i
said
among
which
is
all
of
which
perish
like
a
flower
leaving
behind
them
only
a
feeble
perfume
here
is
another
paragraph
from
which
bears
directly
upon
the
subject
it
deals
with
the
question
as
follows
aged
man
remembers
the
incidents
of
his
youth
despite
his
being
physically
and
mentally
changed
why
then
is
not
the
recollection
of
past
lives
brought
over
by
us
from
our
last
birth
into
the
present
birth
because
memory
is
included
within
the
skandhas
and
the
skandhas
having
changed
with
the
new
existence
a
memory
the
record
of
that
particular
existence
develops
yet
the
record
or
reflection
of
all
the
past
lives
must
survive
for
when
prince
siddhartha
became
buddha
the
full
sequence
of
his
previous
births
were
seen
by
him
and
any
one
who
attains
to
the
state
of
can
thus
retrospectively
trace
the
line
of
his
this
proves
to
you
that
while
the
undying
qualities
of
the
as
love
goodness
charity
themselves
to
the
immortal
ego
photographing
on
it
so
to
speak
a
permanent
image
of
the
divine
aspect
of
the
man
who
was
his
material
skandhas
those
which
generate
the
most
marked
karmic
effects
are
as
evanescent
as
a
flash
of
lightning
and
can
not
impress
the
new
brain
of
the
new
personality
yet
their
failing
to
do
so
impairs
in
no
way
the
identity
of
the
reincarnating
ego
enq
do
you
mean
to
infer
that
that
which
survives
is
only
the
as
you
call
it
that
soul
or
ego
being
one
and
the
same
while
nothing
of
the
personality
remains
theo
not
quite
something
of
each
personality
unless
the
latter
was
an
materialist
with
not
even
a
chink
in
his
nature
for
a
spiritual
ray
to
pass
through
must
survive
as
it
leaves
its
eternal
impress
on
the
incarnating
permanent
self
or
spiritual
ego
see
on
and
consciousness
the
personality
with
its
skandhas
is
ever
changing
with
every
new
birth
it
is
as
said
before
only
the
part
played
by
the
actor
the
true
ego
for
one
night
this
is
why
we
preserve
no
memory
on
the
physical
plane
of
our
past
lives
though
the
has
lived
them
over
and
knows
them
all
enq
then
how
does
it
happen
that
the
real
or
spiritual
man
does
not
impress
his
new
personal
with
this
knowledge
theo
how
is
it
that
the
in
a
poor
could
speak
hebrew
and
play
the
violin
in
their
trance
or
somnambulic
state
and
knew
neither
when
in
their
normal
condition
because
as
every
genuine
psychologist
of
the
old
not
your
modern
school
will
tell
you
the
spiritual
ego
can
act
only
when
the
personal
ego
is
paralysed
the
spiritual
in
man
is
omniscient
and
has
every
knowledge
innate
in
it
while
the
personal
self
is
the
creature
of
its
environment
and
the
slave
of
the
physical
memory
could
the
former
manifest
itself
uninterruptedly
and
without
impediment
there
would
be
no
longer
men
on
earth
but
we
should
all
be
gods
enq
still
there
ought
to
be
exceptions
and
some
ought
to
remember
theo
and
so
there
are
but
who
believes
in
their
report
such
sensitives
are
generally
regarded
as
hallucinated
hysteriacs
as
enthusiasts
or
humbugs
by
modern
materialism
let
them
read
however
works
on
this
subject
a
study
of
forgotten
by
walker
and
see
in
it
the
mass
of
proofs
which
the
able
author
brings
to
bear
on
this
vexed
question
one
speaks
to
people
of
soul
and
some
ask
is
soul
you
ever
proved
its
existence
of
course
it
is
useless
to
argue
with
those
who
are
materialists
but
even
to
them
i
would
put
the
question
you
remember
what
you
were
or
did
when
a
baby
have
you
preserved
the
smallest
recollection
of
your
life
thoughts
or
deeds
or
that
you
lived
at
all
during
the
first
eighteen
months
or
two
years
of
your
existence
then
why
not
deny
that
you
have
ever
lived
as
a
babe
on
the
same
principle
when
to
all
this
we
add
that
the
reincarnating
ego
or
retains
during
the
devachanic
period
merely
the
essence
of
the
experience
of
its
past
or
personality
the
whole
physical
experience
involving
into
a
state
of
or
being
so
to
speak
translated
into
spiritual
formulæ
when
we
remember
further
that
the
term
between
two
rebirths
is
said
to
extend
from
ten
to
fifteen
centuries
during
which
time
the
physical
consciousness
is
totally
and
absolutely
inactive
having
no
organs
to
act
through
and
therefore
the
reason
for
the
absence
of
all
remembrance
in
the
purely
physical
memory
is
apparent
enq
you
just
said
that
the
spiritual
ego
was
omniscient
where
then
is
that
vaunted
omniscience
during
his
devachanic
life
as
you
call
it
theo
during
that
time
it
is
latent
and
potential
because
first
of
all
the
spiritual
ego
the
compound
of
is
the
higher
self
which
being
one
with
the
universal
soul
or
mind
is
alone
omniscient
and
secondly
because
devachan
is
the
idealized
continuation
of
the
terrestrial
life
just
left
behind
a
period
of
retributive
adjustment
and
a
reward
for
unmerited
wrongs
and
sufferings
undergone
in
that
special
life
it
is
omniscient
only
in
devachan
and
exclusively
in
nirvana
when
the
ego
is
merged
in
the
universal
yet
it
omniscient
during
those
hours
on
earth
when
certain
abnormal
conditions
and
physiological
changes
in
the
body
make
the
free
from
the
trammels
of
matter
thus
the
examples
cited
above
of
somnambulists
a
poor
servant
speaking
hebrew
and
another
playing
the
violin
give
you
an
illustration
of
the
case
in
point
this
does
not
mean
that
the
explanations
of
these
two
facts
offered
us
by
medical
science
have
no
truth
in
them
for
one
girl
had
years
before
heard
her
master
a
clergyman
read
hebrew
works
aloud
and
the
other
had
heard
an
artist
playing
a
violin
at
their
farm
but
neither
could
have
done
so
as
perfectly
as
they
did
had
they
not
been
ensouled
by
that
which
owing
to
the
sameness
of
its
nature
with
the
universal
mind
is
omniscient
here
the
higher
principle
acted
on
the
skandhas
and
moved
them
in
the
other
the
personality
being
paralysed
the
individuality
manifested
itself
pray
do
not
confuse
the
two
on
individuality
and
personality
enq
but
what
is
the
difference
between
the
two
i
confess
that
i
am
still
in
the
dark
indeed
it
is
just
that
difference
then
that
you
can
not
impress
too
much
on
our
minds
theo
i
try
to
but
alas
it
is
harder
with
some
than
to
make
them
feel
a
reverence
for
childish
impossibilities
only
because
they
are
and
because
orthodoxy
is
respectable
to
understand
the
idea
well
you
have
to
first
study
the
dual
sets
of
the
or
those
which
belong
to
the
imperishable
ego
and
the
or
those
principles
which
make
up
the
bodies
or
the
series
of
personalities
of
that
ego
let
us
fix
permanent
names
to
these
and
say
that
atma
the
self
is
neither
your
spirit
nor
mine
but
like
sunlight
shines
on
all
it
is
the
universally
diffused
and
is
inseparable
from
its
one
and
absolute
as
the
sunbeam
is
inseparable
from
sunlight
ii
the
spiritual
soul
is
only
its
vehicle
neither
each
separately
nor
the
two
collectively
are
of
any
more
use
to
the
body
of
man
then
sunlight
and
its
beams
are
for
a
mass
of
granite
buried
in
the
earth
the
divine
duad
is
assimilated
by
and
reflected
some
neither
atma
nor
buddhi
are
ever
reached
by
karma
because
the
former
is
the
highest
aspect
of
karma
working
of
itself
in
one
aspect
and
the
other
is
unconscious
this
this
consciousness
or
mind
is
iii
the
derivation
or
product
in
a
reflected
form
of
conception
of
i
or
it
is
therefore
when
inseparably
united
to
the
first
two
called
the
spiritual
ego
and
the
radiant
this
is
the
real
individuality
or
the
divine
man
it
is
this
ego
originally
incarnated
in
the
human
form
animated
by
but
unconscious
since
it
had
no
consciousness
of
the
presence
in
itself
of
the
dual
of
that
form
real
it
is
that
ego
that
body
which
overshadows
every
personality
karma
forces
it
to
incarnate
into
and
this
ego
which
is
held
responsible
for
all
the
sins
committed
through
and
in
every
new
body
or
evanescent
masks
which
hide
the
true
individual
through
the
long
series
of
rebirths
enq
but
is
this
just
why
should
this
ego
receive
punishment
as
the
result
of
deeds
which
it
has
forgotten
theo
it
has
not
forgotten
them
it
knows
and
remembers
its
misdeeds
as
well
as
you
remember
what
you
have
done
yesterday
is
it
because
the
memory
of
that
bundle
of
physical
compounds
called
does
not
recollect
what
its
predecessor
the
personality
did
that
you
imagine
that
the
real
ego
has
forgotten
them
as
well
say
it
is
unjust
that
the
new
boots
on
the
feet
of
a
boy
who
is
flogged
for
stealing
apples
should
be
punished
for
that
which
they
know
nothing
of
enq
but
are
there
no
modes
of
communication
between
the
spiritual
and
human
consciousness
or
memory
theo
of
course
there
are
but
they
have
never
been
recognised
by
your
scientific
modern
psychologists
to
what
do
you
attribute
intuition
the
of
the
conscience
premonitions
vague
undefined
reminiscences
if
not
to
such
communications
would
that
the
majority
of
educated
men
at
least
had
the
fine
spiritual
perceptions
of
coleridge
who
shows
how
intuitional
he
is
in
some
of
his
comments
hear
what
he
says
with
respect
to
the
probability
that
thoughts
are
in
themselves
the
intelligent
faculty
sudden
of
memory
should
be
rendered
more
comprehensive
it
would
require
only
a
different
and
appropriate
organization
the
instead
of
the
to
bring
before
every
human
soul
collective
experience
of
its
whole
past
rather
and
this
is
our
manasic
ego
on
the
reward
and
punishment
of
the
ego
enq
i
have
heard
you
say
that
the
whatever
the
life
of
the
person
he
incarnated
in
may
have
been
on
earth
is
never
visited
with
punishment
theo
never
save
in
very
exceptional
and
rare
cases
of
which
we
will
not
speak
here
as
the
nature
of
the
in
no
way
approaches
any
of
your
theological
conceptions
of
damnation
enq
but
if
it
is
punished
in
this
life
for
the
misdeeds
committed
in
a
previous
one
then
it
is
this
ego
that
ought
to
be
rewarded
also
whether
here
or
when
disincarnated
theo
and
so
it
is
if
we
do
not
admit
of
any
punishment
outside
of
this
earth
it
is
because
the
only
state
the
spiritual
self
knows
of
hereafter
is
that
of
unalloyed
bliss
enq
what
do
you
mean
theo
simply
this
and
sins
committed
on
a
plane
of
objectivity
and
in
a
world
of
matter
can
not
receive
punishment
in
a
world
of
pure
we
believe
in
no
hell
or
paradise
as
localities
in
no
objective
and
worms
that
never
die
nor
in
any
jerusalems
with
streets
paved
with
sapphires
and
diamonds
what
we
believe
in
is
a
or
mental
condition
such
as
we
are
in
during
a
vivid
dream
we
believe
in
an
immutable
law
of
absolute
love
justice
and
mercy
and
believing
in
it
we
say
the
sin
and
dire
results
of
the
original
karmic
transgression
of
the
now
incarnated
egos
no
man
or
the
outer
material
and
periodical
form
of
the
spiritual
entity
can
be
held
with
any
degree
of
justice
responsible
for
the
consequences
of
his
birth
he
does
not
ask
to
be
born
nor
can
he
choose
the
parents
that
will
give
him
life
in
every
respect
he
is
a
victim
to
his
environment
the
child
of
circumstances
over
which
he
has
no
control
and
if
each
of
his
transgressions
were
impartially
investigated
there
would
be
found
nine
out
of
every
ten
cases
when
he
was
the
one
sinned
against
rather
than
the
sinner
life
is
at
best
a
heartless
play
a
stormy
sea
to
cross
and
a
heavy
burden
often
too
difficult
to
bear
the
greatest
philosophers
have
tried
in
vain
to
fathom
and
find
out
its
and
have
all
failed
except
those
who
had
the
key
to
it
namely
the
eastern
sages
life
is
as
shakespeare
describes
it
but
a
walking
poor
player
that
struts
and
frets
his
hour
upon
the
stage
and
then
is
heard
no
more
it
is
a
tale
told
by
an
idiot
full
of
sound
and
fury
signifying
nothing
nothing
in
its
separate
parts
yet
of
the
greatest
importance
in
its
collectivity
or
series
of
lives
at
any
rate
almost
every
individual
life
is
in
its
full
development
a
sorrow
and
are
we
to
believe
that
poor
helpless
men
after
being
tossed
about
like
a
piece
of
rotten
timber
on
the
angry
billows
of
life
is
if
he
proves
too
weak
to
resist
them
to
be
punished
by
a
of
damnation
or
even
a
temporary
punishment

or

average
sinner

delivered
of
the
burden
of
physical
life
the
tired
and
has
won
the
right
to
a
period
of
absolute
rest
and
bliss
the
same
unerringly
wise
and
just
rather
than
merciful
law
which
inflicts
upon
the
incarnated
ego
the
karmic
punishment
for
every
sin
committed
during
the
preceding
life
on

provided
for
the
now
disembodied
entity
a
long
lease
of
mental
rest
the
entire
oblivion
of
every
sad
event
aye
to
the
smallest
painful
thought
that
took
place
in

last
life
as
a

reminiscence

true
river

he
said
for
as
our

so
is

much
more
enq
then
am
i
to
understand
that
the
murderer
the
transgressor
of
law
divine
and
human
in
every
shape
is
allowed
to
go
unpunished

who
ever
said
that
our
philosophy
has
a
doctrine
of
punishment
as
stern
as
that
of
the
most
rigid
calvinist
only
far
more
philosophical
and
consistent
with
absolute
justice
no
deed
not
even
a
sinful
thought
will
go
unpunished
the
latter
more
severely
even
than
the
former
as
a
thought
is
far
more
potential
in
creating
evil
results
than
even
a
deed
we
believe
in
an
unerring
law
of
retribution
called
karma
which
asserts
itself
in
a
natural
concatenation
of
causes
and
their
unavoidable
results
enq
and
how
or
where
does
it
act
theo

is
worthy

in

gospel
every
action
good
or
bad
is
a
prolific
parent
saith
the
wisdom
of
the
ages
put
the
two
together
and
you
will
find
the
after
allowing
the

escaped
from
the
pangs
of

life
a

compensation
karma

its
army
of

it
is
at

that
the

trembles
in

scales
of
just
retribution
as
now
falls
once
again
under

sway
of

law
it
is
in

is
ready
for
a
selected
and
prepared

this
mysterious
inexorable
but
in
the
equity
and
wisdom
of
its
decrees
infallible
law
that
the
sins
of

are

hell
with
theatrical
flames
and
ridiculous
tailed
and
horned
devils
that
the
ego
is
cast
but
verily
on
to
this
earth
the
plane
and
region
of
his
sins
where
he
will
have
to
atone
for
every
bad
thought
and
deed
as
he
has
sown
so
will
he
reap
will
gather
around
him
all
those
other
egos
who
have
suffered
whether
directly
or
indirectly
at
the
hands
or
even
through
the
unconscious
instrumentality
of
the
past
they
will
be
thrown
by
nemesis
in
the
way
of
the
man
concealing
the
the
eternal
ego

enq
but
where
is
the
equity
you
speak
of
since
these
are
not
aware
of
having
sinned
or
been
sinned
against
theo
has
the
coat
torn
to
shreds
from
the
back
of
the
man
who
stole
it
by
another
man
who
was
robbed
of
it
and
recognises
his
property
to
be
regarded
as
fairly
dealt
with
the
new
is
no
better
than
a
fresh
suit
of
clothes
with
its
specific
characteristics
colour
form
and
qualities
but
the
man
who
wears
it
is
the
same
culprit
as
of
old
it
is
the
who
suffers
through
his
and
it
is
this
and
this
alone
that
can
account
for
the
terrible
still
only
injustice
in
the
distribution
of
lots
in
life
to
man
when
your
modern
philosophers
will
have
succeeded
in
showing
to
us
a
good
reason
why
so
many
apparently
innocent
and
good
men
are
born
only
to
suffer
during
a
whole
lifetime
why
so
many
are
born
poor
unto
starvation
in
the
slums
of
great
cities
abandoned
by
fate
and
men
why
while
these
are
born
in
the
gutter
others
open
their
eyes
to
light
in
palaces
while
a
noble
birth
and
fortune
seem
often
given
to
the
worst
of
men
and
only
rarely
to
the
worthy
while
there
are
beggars
whose
selves
are
peers
to
the
highest
and
noblest
of
men
when
this
and
much
more
is
satisfactorily
explained
by
either
your
philosophers
or
theologians
then
only

not
till
then
you
will
have

phantasy
says
olympiodorus
in

phæd
an
impediment
to
our
intellectual
conceptions
and
hence
when
we
are
agitated
by
the

influence
of
the
divinity
if
the
phantasy
intervenes
the
enthusiastic
energy
ceases

contrary
to

other
should
it
be
asked
whether
the
soul
is
able
to
energise
without
the
phantasy
we
reply
that
its
perception
of
universals
proves
that
it
is
able
it
has
perceptions
therefore
independent
of
the
phantasy

an

the

in

is
also
called

because
it
is
according
to
our
philosophy
the
or
of
the
universal
mind
who
or
rather
produced
the
man
by
incarnating
in
the
mankind
in
our
round
it
is

therefore
which
is
the
real
incarnating
and
permanent
the
individuality
and
our
various
and
numberless
personalities
only
its
external
masks
it
is
on
this
transgression
that
the
cruel
and
illogical
dogma
of
the
fallen
angels
has
been
built
it
is
explained
in
vol
ii
of
the
all
our
are
thinking
and
rational
entities
who
had
lived
whether
under
human
or
other
forms
in
the
precedent
manvantara
and
whose
karma
it
was
to
incarnate
in
the
of
this

it
was
taught
in
the
mysteries
that
having
delayed
to
comply
with
this
law
or
having
to
as
hinduism
says
of
the
and
christian
legend
of
the
archangel

and
hence
the
original
sin
of
the
senseless
forms
and
the
punishment
of
the
that
which
is
meant
by
the
rebellious
angels
being
hurled
down
into
hell
is
simply
explained
by
these
pure
spirits
or
egos
being
imprisoned
in
bodies
of
unclean
matter
flesh
i
say
unto
you
that
whosoever
looketh
at
a
woman
to
lust
after
her
hath
committed
adultery
with
her
already
in
his
matt
ix
on
the
and
devachan
on
the
fate
of
the
lower
enq
you
spoke
of
what
is
it
theo
when
the
man
dies
his
lower
three
principles
leave
him
for
ever
body
life
and
the
vehicle
of
the
latter
the
astral
body
or
the
double
of
the
man
and
then
his
four
central
or
middle
principle
the
animal
soul
or
with
what
it
has
assimilated
from
the
lower
manas
and
the
higher
triad
find
themselves
in
the
latter
is
an
astral
locality
the
of
scholastic
theology
the
of
the
ancients
and
strictly
speaking
a
only
in
a
relative
sense
it
has
neither
a
definite
area
nor
boundary
but
exists
subjective
space
is
beyond
our
sensuous
perceptions
still
it
exists
and
it
is
there
that
the
astral
of
all
the
beings
that
have
lived
animals
included
await
their
for
the
animals
it
comes
with
the
disintegration
and
the
entire
fading
out
of
their
particles
to
the
last
for
the
human
it
begins
when
the
triad
is
said
to
itself
from
its
lower
principles
or
the
reflection
of
the
by
falling
into
the
devachanic
state
enq
and
what
happens
after
this
theo
then
the
phantom
remaining
bereft
of
its
informing
thinking
principle
the
higher
and
the
lower
aspect
of
the
latter
the
animal
intelligence
no
longer
receiving
light
from
the
higher
mind
and
no
longer
having
a
physical
brain
to
work
through
collapses
enq
in
what
way
theo
well
it
falls
into
the
state
of
the
frog
when
certain
portions
of
its
brain
are
taken
out
by
the
vivisector
it
can
think
no
more
even
on
the
lowest
animal
plane
henceforth
it
is
no
longer
even
the
lower
manas
since
this
is
nothing
without
the
enq
and
is
it
nonentity
which
we
find
materializing
in
séance
rooms
with
mediums
theo
it
is
this
nonentity
a
true
nonentity
however
only
as
to
reasoning
or
cogitating
powers
still
an
however
astral
and
fluidic
as
shown
in
certain
cases
when
having
been
magnetically
and
unconsciously
drawn
toward
a
medium
it
is
revived
for
a
time
and
lives
in
him
by
so
to
speak
this
or
the
may
be
compared
with
the
which
has
an
ethereal
gelatinous
appearance
so
long
as
it
is
in
its
own
element
or
water
the
specific
but
which
no
sooner
is
it
thrown
out
of
it
than
it
dissolves
in
the
hand
or
on
the
sand
especially
in
sunlight
in
the
aura
it
lives
a
kind
of
vicarious
life
and
reasons
and
speaks
either
through
the
brain
or
those
of
other
persons
present
but
this
would
lead
us
too
far
and
upon
other
grounds
whereon
i
have
no
desire
to
trespass
let
us
keep
to
the
subject
of
enq
what
of
the
latter
how
long
does
the
incarnating
remain
in
the
devachanic
state
theo
this
we
are
taught
depends
on
the
degree
of
spirituality
and
the
merit
or
demerit
of
the
last
incarnation
the
average
time
is
from
ten
to
fifteen
centuries
as
i
already
told
you
enq
but
why
could
not
this
ego
manifest
and
communicate
with
mortals
as
spiritualists
will
have
it
what
is
there
to
prevent
a
mother
from
communicating
with
the
children
she
left
on
earth
a
husband
with
his
wife
and
so
on
it
is
a
most
consoling
belief
i
must
confess
nor
do
i
wonder
that
those
who
believe
in
it
are
so
averse
to
give
it
up
theo
nor
are
they
forced
to
unless
they
happen
to
prefer
truth
to
fiction
however
uncongenial
our
doctrines
may
be
to
spiritualists
yet
nothing
of
what
we
believe
in
and
teach
is
half
as
selfish
and
cruel
as
what
they
preach
enq
i
do
not
understand
you
what
is
selfish
theo
their
doctrine
of
the
return
of
spirits
the
real
as
they
say
and
i
will
tell
you
why
if
it
if
you
like
a
of
bliss
and
of
supreme
felicity
if
it
is
such
a
place
or
say
logic
tells
us
that
no
sorrow
or
even
a
shade
of
pain
can
be
experienced
therein
shall
wipe
away
all
the
tears
from
the
of
those
in
paradise
we
read
in
the
book
of
many
promises
and
if
the
of
the
are
enabled
to
return
and
see
all
that
is
going
on
on
earth
and
especially
their
what
kind
of
bliss
can
be
in
store
for
them
why
theosophists
do
not
believe
in
the
return
of
pure
enq
what
do
you
mean
why
should
this
interfere
with
their
bliss
theo
simply
this
and
here
is
an
instance
a
mother
dies
leaving
behind
her
little
helpless
whom
she
a
beloved
husband
also
we
say
that
her
or
individuality
which
is
now
all
impregnated
for
the
entire
devachanic
period
with
the
noblest
feelings
held
by
its
late
love
for
her
children
pity
for
those
who
suffer
and
so
say
that
it
is
now
entirely
separated
from
the
of
tears
that
its
future
bliss
consists
in
that
blessed
ignorance
of
all
the
woes
it
left
behind
spiritualists
say
on
the
contrary
that
it
is
as
vividly
aware
of
them
more
so
than
for
see
more
than
mortals
in
the
flesh
we
say
that
the
bliss
of
the
consists
in
its
complete
conviction
that
it
has
never
left
the
earth
and
that
there
is
no
such
thing
as
death
at
all
that
the
spiritual
of
the
mother
will
represent
to
her
that
she
lives
surrounded
by
her
children
and
all
those
whom
she
loved
that
no
gap
no
link
will
be
missing
to
make
her
disembodied
state
the
most
perfect
and
absolute
happiness
the
spiritualists
deny
this
point
blank
according
to
their
doctrine
unfortunate
man
is
not
liberated
even
by
death
from
the
sorrows
of
this
life
not
a
drop
from
the
of
pain
and
suffering
will
miss
his
lips
and
since
he
sees
everything
now
shall
he
drink
it
to
the
bitter
dregs
thus
the
loving
wife
who
during
her
lifetime
was
ready
to
save
her
husband
sorrow
at
the
price
of
her
blood
is
now
doomed
to
see
in
utter
helplessness
his
despair
and
to
register
every
hot
tear
he
sheds
for
her
loss
worse
than
that
she
may
see
the
tears
dry
too
soon
and
another
beloved
face
shine
on
him
the
father
of
her
children
find
another
woman
replacing
her
in
his
affections
doomed
to
hear
her
orphans
giving
the
holy
name
of
to
one
indifferent
to
them
and
to
see
those
little
children
neglected
if
not
according
to
this
doctrine
the
wafting
to
immortal
becomes
without
any
transition
the
way
into
a
new
path
of
mental
suffering
and
yet
the
columns
of
the
of
light
the
veteran
journal
of
the
american
spiritualists
are
filled
with
messages
from
the
dead
the
departed
ones
who
all
write
to
say
how
very
they
are
is
such
a
state
of
knowledge
consistent
with
bliss
then
stands
in
such
a
case
for
the
greatest
curse
and
orthodox
damnation
must
be
a
relief
in
comparison
to
it
enq
but
how
does
your
theory
avoid
this
how
can
you
reconcile
the
theory
of
omniscience
with
its
blindness
to
that
which
is
taking
place
on
earth
theo
because
such
is
the
law
of
love
and
mercy
during
every
devachanic
period
the
ego
omniscient
as
it
is
clothes
itself
so
to
say
with
the
of
the
that
was
i
have
just
told
you
that
the
efflorescence
of
all
the
abstract
therefore
undying
and
eternal
qualities
or
attributes
such
as
love
and
mercy
the
love
of
the
good
the
true
and
the
beautiful
that
ever
spoke
in
the
heart
of
the
living
clung
after
death
to
the
ego
and
therefore
followed
it
to
devachan
for
the
time
being
then
the
ego
becomes
the
ideal
reflection
of
the
human
being
it
was
when
last
on
earth
and
is
not
omniscient
were
it
that
it
would
never
be
in
the
state
we
call
devachan
at
all
enq
what
are
your
reasons
for
it
theo
if
you
want
an
answer
on
the
strict
lines
of
our
philosophy
then
i
will
say
that
it
is
because
everything
is
outside
of
eternal
truth
which
has
neither
form
colour
nor
limitation
he
who
has
placed
himself
beyond
the
veil
of
such
are
the
highest
adepts
and
have
no
devachan
as
to
the
ordinary
mortal
his
bliss
in
it
is
complete
it
is
an
oblivion
of
all
that
gave
it
pain
or
sorrow
in
the
past
incarnation
and
even
oblivion
of
the
fact
that
such
things
as
pain
or
sorrow
exist
at
all
the
lives
its
intermediate
cycle
between
two
incarnations
surrounded
by
everything
it
had
aspired
to
in
vain
and
in
the
companionship
of
everyone
it
loved
on
earth
it
has
reached
the
fulfilment
of
all
its
and
thus
it
lives
throughout
long
centuries
an
existence
of
happiness
which
is
the
reward
for
its
sufferings
in
in
short
it
bathes
in
a
sea
of
uninterrupted
felicity
spanned
only
by
events
of
still
greater
felicity
in
degree
enq
but
this
is
more
than
simple
delusion
it
is
an
existence
of
insane
hallucinations
theo
from
your
standpoint
it
may
be
not
so
from
that
of
philosophy
besides
which
is
not
our
whole
terrestrial
life
filled
with
such
delusions
have
you
never
met
men
and
women
living
for
years
in
a
paradise
and
because
you
should
happen
to
learn
that
the
husband
of
a
wife
whom
she
adores
and
believes
herself
as
beloved
by
him
is
untrue
to
her
would
you
go
and
break
her
heart
and
beautiful
dream
by
rudely
awakening
her
to
the
reality
i
think
not
i
say
it
again
such
oblivion
and
you
call
it
only
a
merciful
law
of
nature
and
strict
justice
at
any
rate
it
is
a
far
more
fascinating
prospect
than
the
orthodox
golden
harp
with
a
pair
of
wings
the
assurance
that
soul
that
lives
ascends
frequently
and
runs
familiarly
through
the
streets
of
the
heavenly
jerusalem
visiting
the
patriarchs
and
prophets
saluting
the
apostles
and
admiring
the
army
of
may
seem
of
a
more
pious
character
to
some
nevertheless
it
is
a
hallucination
of
a
far
more
delusive
character
since
mothers
love
their
children
with
an
immortal
love
we
all
know
while
the
personages
mentioned
in
the
are
still
of
a
rather
doubtful
nature
but
i
would
still
rather
accept
the
jerusalem
with
its
streets
paved
like
the
show
windows
of
a
shop
than
find
consolation
in
the
heartless
doctrine
of
the
spiritualists
the
idea
alone
that
the
conscious
of
father
mother
daughter
or
brother
find
their
bliss
in
a
a
little
more
natural
but
just
as
ridiculous
as
the
in
its
be
enough
to
make
one
lose
every
respect
for
to
believe
that
a
pure
spirit
can
feel
happy
while
doomed
to
witness
the
sins
mistakes
treachery
and
above
all
the
sufferings
of
those
from
whom
it
is
severed
by
death
and
whom
it
loves
best
without
being
able
to
help
them
would
be
a
maddening
thought
enq
there
is
something
in
your
argument
i
confess
to
having
never
seen
it
in
this
light
theo
just
so
and
one
must
be
selfish
to
the
core
and
utterly
devoid
of
the
sense
of
retributive
justice
to
have
ever
imagined
such
a
thing
we
are
with
those
whom
we
have
lost
in
material
form
and
far
far
nearer
to
them
now
than
when
they
were
alive
and
it
is
not
only
in
the
fancy
of
the
as
some
may
imagine
but
in
reality
for
pure
divine
love
is
not
merely
the
blossom
of
a
human
heart
but
has
its
roots
in
eternity
spiritual
holy
love
is
immortal
and
karma
brings
sooner
or
later
all
those
who
loved
each
other
with
such
a
spiritual
affection
to
incarnate
once
more
in
the
same
family
group
again
we
say
that
love
beyond
the
grave
illusion
though
you
may
call
it
has
a
magic
and
divine
potency
which
reacts
on
the
living
a
filled
with
love
for
the
imaginary
children
it
sees
near
itself
living
a
life
of
happiness
as
real
to
as
when
on
love
will
always
be
felt
by
the
children
in
flesh
it
will
manifest
in
their
dreams
and
often
in
various
protections
and
escapes
for
love
is
a
strong
shield
and
is
not
limited
by
space
or
time
as
with
this
devachanic
so
with
the
rest
of
human
relationships
and
attachments
save
the
purely
selfish
or
material
analogy
will
suggest
to
you
the
rest
enq
in
no
case
then
do
you
admit
the
possibility
of
the
communication
of
the
living
with
the
spirit
theo
yes
there
is
a
case
and
even
two
exceptions
to
the
rule
the
first
exception
is
during
the
few
days
that
follow
immediately
the
death
of
a
person
and
before
the
passes
into
the
devachanic
state
whether
any
living
mortal
save
a
few
exceptional
when
the
intensity
of
the
desire
in
the
dying
person
to
return
for
some
purpose
forced
the
higher
consciousness
remain
and
therefore
it
was
really
the
the
that
communicated
derived
much
benefit
from
the
return
of
the
spirit
into
the
plane
is
another
question
the
spirit
is
dazed
after
death
and
falls
very
soon
into
what
we
call
the
second
exception
is
found
in
the
enq
what
about
them
and
what
does
the
name
mean
for
you
theo
it
is
the
name
given
to
those
who
though
they
have
won
the
right
to
nirvana
and
cyclic
as
the
latter
is
an
illusion
of
our
consciousness
a
happy
dream
and
as
those
who
are
fit
for
nirvana
must
have
lost
entirely
every
desire
or
possibility
of
the
illusions
out
of
pity
for
mankind
and
those
they
left
on
earth
renounced
the
nirvanic
state
such
an
adept
or
saint
or
whatever
you
may
call
him
believing
it
a
selfish
act
to
rest
in
bliss
while
mankind
groans
under
the
burden
of
misery
produced
by
ignorance
renounces
nirvana
and
determines
to
remain
invisible
on
this
earth
they
have
no
material
body
as
they
have
left
it
behind
but
otherwise
they
remain
with
all
their
principles
even
astral
in
our
sphere
and
such
can
and
do
communicate
with
a
few
elect
ones
only
surely
not
with
mediums
enq
i
have
put
you
the
question
about
because
i
read
in
some
german
and
other
works
that
it
was
the
name
given
to
the
terrestrial
appearances
or
bodies
assumed
by
buddhas
in
the
northern
buddhistic
teachings
theo
so
they
are
only
the
orientalists
have
confused
this
terrestrial
body
by
understanding
it
to
be
and
instead
of
purely
astral
and
subjective
enq
and
what
good
can
they
do
on
earth
theo
not
much
as
regards
individuals
as
they
have
no
right
to
interfere
with
karma
and
can
only
advise
and
inspire
mortals
for
the
general
good
yet
they
do
more
beneficent
actions
than
you
imagine
enq
to
this
science
would
never
subscribe
not
even
modern
psychology
for
them
no
portion
of
intelligence
can
survive
the
physical
brain
what
would
you
answer
them
theo
i
would
not
even
go
to
the
trouble
of
answering
but
would
simply
say
in
the
words
given
to
oxon
is
perpetuated
after
the
body
is
dead
though
it
is
not
a
question
of
the
brain
only
it
is
reasonable
to
propound
the
indestructibility
of
the
human
spirit
from
what
we
enq
but
is
a
spiritualist
theo
quite
so
and
the
only
spiritualist
i
know
of
though
we
may
still
disagree
with
him
on
many
a
minor
question
apart
from
this
no
spiritualist
comes
nearer
to
the
occult
truths
than
he
does
like
any
one
of
us
he
speaks
incessantly
the
surface
dangers
that
beset
the
muddler
with
the
occult
who
crosses
the
threshold
without
counting
the
our
only
disagreement
rests
in
the
question
of
otherwise
i
for
one
coincide
almost
entirely
with
him
and
accept
the
three
propositions
he
embodied
in
his
address
of
july
it
is
this
eminent
spiritualist
rather
who
disagrees
with
us
not
we
with
him
enq
what
are
these
propositions
theo
that
there
is
a
life
coincident
with
and
independent
of
the
physical
life
of
the
that
as
a
necessary
corollary
this
life
extends
beyond
the
life
of
the
we
say
it
extends
throughout
devachan
that
there
is
communication
between
the
denizens
of
that
state
of
existence
and
those
of
the
world
in
which
we
now
all
depend
you
see
on
the
minor
and
secondary
aspects
of
these
fundamental
propositions
everything
depends
on
the
views
we
take
of
spirit
and
soul
or
and
spiritualists
confuse
the
two
we
separate
them
and
say
that
with
the
exceptions
above
enumerated
no
will
revisit
the
earth
though
the
animal
soul
may
but
let
us
return
once
more
to
our
direct
subject
the
skandhas
enq
i
begin
to
understand
better
now
it
is
the
spirit
so
to
say
of
those
skandhas
which
are
the
most
ennobling
which
attaching
themselves
to
the
incarnating
ego
survive
and
are
added
to
the
stock
of
its
angelic
experiences
and
it
is
the
attributes
connected
with
the
material
skandhas
with
selfish
and
personal
motives
which
disappearing
from
the
field
of
action
between
two
incarnations
reappear
at
the
subsequent
incarnation
as
karmic
results
to
be
atoned
for
and
therefore
the
spirit
will
not
leave
devachan
is
it
so
theo
very
nearly
so
if
you
add
to
this
that
the
law
of
retribution
or
karma
rewarding
the
highest
and
most
spiritual
in
devachan
never
fails
to
reward
them
again
on
earth
by
giving
them
a
further
development
and
furnishing
the
ego
with
a
body
fitted
for
it
then
you
will
be
quite
correct
a
few
words
about
the
skandhas
enq
what
becomes
of
the
other
the
lower
skandhas
of
the
personality
after
the
death
of
the
body
are
they
quite
destroyed
theo
they
are
and
yet
they
are
fresh
metaphysical
and
occult
mystery
for
you
they
are
destroyed
as
the
working
stock
in
hand
of
the
personality
they
remain
as
as
germs
hanging
in
the
atmosphere
of
the
terrestrial
plane
ready
to
come
to
life
as
so
many
avenging
fiends
to
attach
themselves
to
the
new
personality
of
the
ego
when
it
reincarnates
enq
this
really
passes
my
comprehension
and
is
very
difficult
to
understand
theo
not
once
that
you
have
assimilated
all
the
details
for
then
you
will
see
that
for
logic
consistency
profound
philosophy
divine
mercy
and
equity
this
doctrine
of
has
not
its
equal
on
earth
it
is
a
belief
in
a
perpetual
progress
for
each
incarnating
ego
or
divine
soul
in
an
evolution
from
the
outward
into
the
inward
from
the
material
to
the
spiritual
arriving
at
the
end
of
each
stage
at
absolute
unity
with
the
divine
principle
from
strength
to
strength
from
beauty
and
perfection
of
one
plane
to
the
greater
beauty
and
perfection
of
another
with
accessions
of
new
glory
of
fresh
knowledge
and
power
in
each
cycle
such
is
the
destiny
of
every
ego
which
thus
becomes
its
own
saviour
in
each
world
and
incarnation
enq
but
christianity
teaches
the
same
it
also
preaches
progression
theo
yes
only
with
the
addition
of
something
else
it
tells
us
of
the
of
attaining
salvation
without
the
aid
of
a
miraculous
saviour
and
therefore
dooms
to
perdition
all
those
who
will
not
accept
the
dogma
this
is
just
the
difference
between
christian
theology
and
theosophy
the
former
enforces
belief
in
the
descent
of
the
spiritual
ego
into
the
the
latter
inculcates
the
necessity
of
endeavouring
to
elevate
oneself
to
the
christos
or
buddhi
state
enq
by
teaching
the
annihilation
of
consciousness
in
case
of
failure
however
you
think
that
it
amounts
to
the
annihilation
of
in
the
opinion
of
the
theo
from
the
standpoint
of
those
who
believe
in
the
resurrection
of
the
body
and
insist
that
every
bone
every
artery
and
atom
of
flesh
will
be
raised
bodily
on
the
judgment
course
it
does
if
you
still
insist
that
it
is
the
perishable
form
and
finite
qualities
that
make
up
man
then
we
shall
hardly
understand
each
other
and
if
you
do
not
understand
that
by
limiting
the
existence
of
every
ego
to
one
life
on
earth
you
make
of
deity
an
indra
of
the
puranic
dead
letter
a
cruel
moloch
a
god
who
makes
an
inextricable
mess
on
earth
and
yet
claims
thanks
for
it
then
the
sooner
we
drop
the
conversation
the
better
enq
but
let
us
return
now
that
the
subject
of
the
skandhas
is
disposed
of
to
the
question
of
the
consciousness
which
survives
death
this
is
the
point
which
interests
most
people
do
we
possess
more
knowledge
in
devachan
than
we
do
in
earth
life
theo
in
one
sense
we
can
acquire
more
knowledge
that
is
we
can
develop
further
any
faculty
which
we
loved
and
strove
after
during
life
provided
it
is
concerned
with
abstract
and
ideal
things
such
as
music
painting
poetry
since
devachan
is
merely
an
idealized
and
subjective
continuation
of
enq
but
if
in
devachan
the
spirit
is
free
from
matter
why
should
it
not
possess
all
knowledge
theo
because
as
i
told
you
the
ego
is
so
to
say
wedded
to
the
memory
of
its
last
incarnation
thus
if
you
think
over
what
i
have
said
and
string
all
the
facts
together
you
will
realize
that
the
devachanic
state
is
not
one
of
omniscience
but
a
transcendental
continuation
of
the
personal
life
just
terminated
it
is
the
rest
of
the
soul
from
the
toils
of
life
enq
but
the
scientific
materialists
assert
that
after
the
death
of
man
nothing
remains
that
the
human
body
simply
disintegrates
into
its
component
elements
and
that
what
we
call
soul
is
merely
a
temporary
produced
as
a
of
organic
action
which
will
evaporate
like
steam
is
not
theirs
a
strange
state
of
mind
theo
not
strange
at
all
that
i
see
if
they
say
that
ceases
with
the
body
then
in
their
case
they
simply
utter
an
unconscious
prophecy
for
once
they
are
firmly
convinced
of
what
they
assert
no
conscious
is
possible
for
them
for
there
exceptions
to
every
rule
on
and
consciousness
enq
but
if
human
survives
death
as
a
rule
why
should
there
be
exceptions
theo
in
the
fundamental
principles
of
the
spiritual
world
no
exception
is
possible
but
there
are
rules
for
those
who
see
and
rules
for
those
who
prefer
to
remain
blind
enq
quite
so
i
understand
this
is
but
an
aberration
of
the
blind
man
who
denies
the
existence
of
the
sun
because
he
does
not
see
it
but
after
death
his
spiritual
eyes
will
certainly
compel
him
to
see
is
this
what
you
mean
theo
he
will
not
be
compelled
nor
will
he
see
anything
having
persistently
denied
during
life
the
continuance
of
existence
after
death
he
will
be
unable
to
see
it
because
his
spiritual
capacity
having
been
stunted
in
life
it
can
not
develop
after
death
and
he
will
remain
blind
by
insisting
that
he
see
it
you
evidently
mean
one
thing
and
i
another
you
speak
of
the
spirit
from
the
spirit
or
the
flame
from
the
atma
in
you
confuse
it
with
the
human
you
do
not
understand
me
let
me
try
to
make
it
clear
the
whole
gist
of
your
question
is
to
know
whether
in
the
case
of
a
downright
materialist
the
complete
loss
of
and
after
death
is
possible
it
so
i
answer
it
is
possible
because
believing
firmly
in
our
esoteric
doctrine
which
refers
to
the
period
or
the
interval
between
two
lives
or
births
as
merely
a
transitory
state
i
say
whether
that
interval
between
two
acts
of
the
illusionary
drama
of
life
lasts
one
year
or
a
million
that
state
may
without
any
breach
of
the
fundamental
law
prove
to
be
just
the
same
state
as
that
of
a
man
who
is
in
a
dead
faint
enq
but
since
you
have
just
said
that
the
fundamental
laws
of
the
after
death
state
admit
of
no
exceptions
how
can
this
be
theo
nor
do
i
say
that
it
does
admit
of
an
exception
but
the
spiritual
law
of
continuity
applies
only
to
things
which
are
truly
real
to
one
who
has
read
and
understood
mundakya
upanishad
and
all
this
becomes
very
clear
i
will
say
more
it
is
sufficient
to
understand
what
we
mean
by
buddhi
and
the
duality
of
manas
to
gain
a
clear
perception
why
the
materialist
may
fail
to
have
a
survival
after
death
since
manas
in
its
lower
aspect
is
the
seat
of
the
terrestrial
mind
it
can
therefore
give
only
that
perception
of
the
universe
which
is
based
on
the
evidence
of
that
mind
it
can
not
give
spiritual
vision
it
is
said
in
the
eastern
school
that
between
buddhi
and
manas
the
or
iswara
and
pragna
there
is
in
reality
no
more
difference
than
a
forest
and
its
trees
a
lake
and
its
as
the
mundakya
teaches
one
or
hundreds
of
trees
dead
from
loss
of
vitality
or
uprooted
are
yet
incapable
of
preventing
the
forest
from
being
still
a
forest
enq
but
as
i
understand
it
buddhi
represents
in
this
simile
the
forest
and
the
trees
and
if
buddhi
is
immortal
how
can
that
which
is
similar
to
it
entirely
lose
its
consciousness
till
the
day
of
its
new
incarnation
i
can
not
understand
it
theo
you
can
not
because
you
will
mix
up
an
abstract
representation
of
the
whole
with
its
casual
changes
of
form
remember
that
if
it
can
be
said
of
that
it
is
unconditionally
immortal
the
same
can
not
be
said
of
the
lower
manas
still
less
of
taijasi
which
is
merely
an
attribute
neither
of
these
neither
manas
nor
taijasi
can
exist
apart
from
buddhi
the
divine
soul
because
the
first
is
in
its
lower
aspect
a
qualificative
attribute
of
the
terrestrial
personality
and
the
second
is
identical
with
the
first
because
it
is
the
same
manas
only
with
the
light
of
buddhi
reflected
on
it
in
its
turn
buddhi
would
remain
only
an
impersonal
spirit
without
this
element
which
it
borrows
from
the
human
soul
which
conditions
and
makes
of
it
in
this
illusive
universe
it
were
something
from
the
universal
soul
for
the
whole
period
of
the
cycle
of
incarnation
say
rather
that
can
neither
die
nor
lose
its
compound
in
eternity
nor
the
recollection
of
its
previous
incarnations
in
which
the
the
spiritual
and
the
human
been
closely
linked
together
but
it
is
not
so
in
the
case
of
a
materialist
whose
human
soul
not
only
receives
nothing
from
the
divine
soul
but
even
refuses
to
recognise
its
existence
you
can
hardly
apply
this
axiom
to
the
attributes
and
qualifications
of
the
human
soul
for
it
would
be
like
saying
that
because
your
divine
soul
is
immortal
therefore
the
bloom
on
your
cheek
must
also
be
immortal
whereas
this
bloom
like
taijasi
is
simply
a
transitory
phenomenon
enq
do
i
understand
you
to
say
that
we
must
not
mix
in
our
minds
the
noumenon
with
the
phenomenon
the
cause
with
its
effect
theo
i
do
say
so
and
repeat
that
limited
to
manas
or
the
human
soul
alone
the
radiance
of
taijasi
itself
becomes
a
mere
question
of
time
because
both
immortality
and
consciousness
after
death
become
for
the
terrestrial
personality
of
man
simply
conditioned
attributes
as
they
depend
entirely
on
conditions
and
beliefs
created
by
the
human
soul
itself
during
the
life
of
its
body
karma
acts
incessantly
we
reap
our
only
the
fruit
of
that
which
we
have
ourselves
sown
in
this
enq
but
if
my
ego
can
after
the
destruction
of
my
body
become
plunged
in
a
state
of
entire
unconsciousness
then
where
can
be
the
punishment
for
the
sins
of
my
past
life
theo
our
philosophy
teaches
that
karmic
punishment
reaches
ego
only
in
its
next
incarnation
after
death
it
receives
only
the
reward
for
the
unmerited
sufferings
endured
during
its
past
incarnation
the
whole
punishment
after
death
even
for
the
materialist
consists
therefore
in
the
absence
of
any
reward
and
the
utter
loss
of
the
consciousness
of
bliss
and
rest
karma
is
the
child
of
the
terrestrial
ego
the
fruit
of
the
actions
of
the
tree
which
is
the
objective
personality
visible
to
all
as
much
as
the
fruit
of
all
the
thoughts
and
even
motives
of
the
spiritual
but
karma
is
also
the
tender
mother
who
heals
the
wounds
inflicted
by
her
during
the
preceding
life
before
she
will
begin
to
torture
this
ego
by
inflicting
upon
him
new
ones
if
it
may
be
said
that
there
is
not
a
mental
or
physical
suffering
in
the
life
of
a
mortal
which
is
not
the
direct
fruit
and
consequence
of
some
sin
in
a
preceding
existence
on
the
other
hand
since
he
does
not
preserve
the
slightest
recollection
of
it
in
his
actual
life
and
feels
himself
not
deserving
of
such
punishment
and
therefore
thinks
he
suffers
for
no
guilt
of
his
own
this
alone
is
sufficient
to
entitle
the
human
soul
to
the
fullest
consolation
rest
and
bliss
in
his
existence
death
comes
to
our
spiritual
selves
ever
as
a
deliverer
and
friend
for
the
materialist
who
notwithstanding
his
materialism
was
not
a
bad
man
the
interval
between
the
two
lives
will
be
like
the
unbroken
and
placid
sleep
of
a
child
either
entirely
dreamless
or
filled
with
pictures
of
which
he
will
have
no
definite
perception
while
for
the
average
mortal
it
will
be
a
dream
as
vivid
as
life
and
full
of
realistic
bliss
and
visions
enq
then
the
personal
man
must
always
go
on
suffering
the
karmic
penalties
which
the
ego
has
incurred
theo
not
quite
so
at
the
solemn
moment
of
death
every
man
even
when
death
is
sudden
sees
the
whole
of
his
past
life
marshalled
before
him
in
its
minutest
details
for
one
short
instant
the
becomes
one
with
the
and
but
this
instant
is
enough
to
show
to
him
the
whole
claim
of
causes
which
have
been
at
work
during
his
life
he
sees
and
now
understands
himself
as
he
is
unadorned
by
flattery
or
he
reads
his
life
remaining
as
a
spectator
looking
down
into
the
arena
he
is
quitting
he
feels
and
knows
the
justice
of
all
the
suffering
that
has
overtaken
him
enq
does
this
happen
to
everyone
theo
without
any
exception
very
good
and
holy
men
see
we
are
taught
not
only
the
life
they
are
leaving
but
even
several
preceding
lives
in
which
were
produced
the
causes
that
made
them
what
they
were
in
the
life
just
closing
they
recognise
the
law
of
karma
in
all
its
majesty
and
justice
enq
is
there
anything
corresponding
to
this
before
theo
there
is
as
the
man
at
the
moment
of
death
has
a
retrospective
insight
into
the
life
he
has
led
so
at
the
moment
he
is
reborn
on
to
earth
the
awaking
from
the
state
of
devachan
has
a
prospective
vision
of
the
life
which
awaits
him
and
realizes
all
the
causes
that
have
led
to
it
he
realizes
them
and
sees
futurity
because
it
is
between
devachan
and
that
the
regains
his
full
consciousness
and
for
a
short
time
the
god
he
was
before
in
compliance
with
karmic
law
he
first
descended
into
matter
and
incarnated
in
the
first
man
of
flesh
the
sees
all
its
and
misses
not
one
of
them
what
is
really
meant
by
annihilation
enq
i
have
heard
some
theosophists
speak
of
a
golden
thread
on
which
their
lives
were
strung
what
do
they
mean
by
this
theo
in
the
hindu
sacred
books
it
is
said
that
that
which
undergoes
periodical
incarnation
is
the
which
means
literally
the
it
is
a
synonym
of
the
reincarnating
conjoined
with
absorbs
the
manasic
recollections
of
all
our
preceding
lives
it
is
so
called
because
like
the
pearls
on
a
thread
so
is
the
long
series
of
human
lives
strung
together
on
that
one
thread
in
some
upanishad
these
recurrent
rebirths
are
likened
to
the
life
of
a
mortal
which
oscillates
periodically
between
sleep
and
waking
enq
this
i
must
say
does
not
seem
very
clear
and
i
will
tell
you
why
for
the
man
who
awakes
another
day
commences
but
that
man
is
the
same
in
soul
and
body
as
he
was
the
day
before
whereas
at
every
incarnation
a
full
change
takes
place
not
only
of
the
external
envelope
sex
and
personality
but
even
of
the
mental
and
psychic
capacities
the
simile
does
not
seem
to
me
quite
correct
the
man
who
arises
from
sleep
remembers
quite
clearly
what
he
has
done
yesterday
the
day
before
and
even
months
and
years
ago
but
none
of
us
has
the
slightest
recollection
of
a
preceding
life
or
of
any
fact
or
event
concerning
it
i
may
forget
in
the
morning
what
i
have
dreamt
during
the
night
still
i
know
that
i
have
slept
and
have
the
certainty
that
i
lived
during
sleep
but
what
recollection
can
i
have
of
my
past
incarnation
until
the
moment
of
death
how
do
you
reconcile
this
theo
some
people
do
recollect
their
past
incarnations
during
life
but
these
are
buddhas
and
initiates
this
is
what
the
yogis
call
or
the
knowledge
of
the
whole
series
of
past
incarnations
enq
but
we
ordinary
mortals
who
have
not
reached
how
are
we
to
understand
this
simile
theo
by
studying
it
and
trying
to
understand
more
correctly
the
characteristics
and
the
three
kinds
of
sleep
sleep
is
a
general
and
immutable
law
for
man
as
for
beast
but
there
are
different
kinds
of
sleep
and
still
more
different
dreams
and
visions
enq
but
this
takes
us
to
another
subject
let
us
return
to
the
materialist
who
while
not
denying
dreams
which
he
could
hardly
do
yet
denies
immortality
in
general
and
the
survival
of
his
own
individuality
theo
and
the
materialist
without
knowing
it
is
right
one
who
has
no
inner
perception
of
and
faith
in
the
immortality
of
his
soul
in
that
man
the
soul
can
never
become
but
will
remain
simply
manas
and
for
manas
alone
there
is
no
immortality
possible
in
order
to
live
in
the
world
to
come
a
conscious
life
one
has
to
believe
first
of
all
in
that
life
during
the
terrestrial
existence
on
these
two
aphorisms
of
the
secret
science
all
the
philosophy
about
the
consciousness
and
the
immortality
of
the
soul
is
built
the
ego
receives
always
according
to
its
deserts
after
the
dissolution
of
the
body
there
commences
for
it
a
period
of
full
awakened
consciousness
or
a
state
of
chaotic
dreams
or
an
utterly
dreamless
sleep
undistinguishable
from
annihilation
and
these
are
the
three
kinds
of
sleep
if
our
physiologists
find
the
cause
of
dreams
and
visions
in
an
unconscious
preparation
for
them
during
the
waking
hours
why
can
not
the
same
be
admitted
for
the
dreams
i
repeat
it
is
after
death
before
the
spiritual
eyes
of
the
soul
begins
a
performance
according
to
a
programme
learnt
and
very
often
unconsciously
composed
by
ourselves
the
practical
carrying
out
of
beliefs
or
of
illusions
which
have
been
created
by
ourselves
the
methodist
will
be
methodist
the
mussulman
a
mussulman
at
least
for
some
a
perfect
paradise
of
each
creation
and
making
these
are
the
fruits
of
the
tree
of
life
naturally
our
belief
or
unbelief
in
the
fact
of
conscious
immortality
is
unable
to
influence
the
unconditioned
reality
of
the
fact
itself
once
that
it
exists
but
the
belief
or
unbelief
in
that
immortality
as
the
property
of
independent
or
separate
entities
can
not
fail
to
give
colour
to
that
fact
in
its
application
to
each
of
these
entities
now
do
you
begin
to
understand
it
enq
i
think
i
do
the
materialist
disbelieving
in
everything
that
can
not
be
proven
to
him
by
his
five
senses
or
by
scientific
reasoning
based
exclusively
on
the
data
furnished
by
these
senses
in
spite
of
their
inadequacy
and
rejecting
every
spiritual
manifestation
accepts
life
as
the
only
conscious
existence
therefore
according
to
their
beliefs
so
will
it
be
unto
them
they
will
lose
their
personal
ego
and
will
plunge
into
a
dreamless
sleep
until
a
new
awakening
is
it
so
theo
almost
so
remember
the
practically
universal
teaching
of
the
two
kinds
of
conscious
existence
the
terrestrial
and
the
spiritual
the
latter
must
be
considered
real
from
the
very
fact
that
it
is
inhabited
by
the
eternal
changeless
and
immortal
monad
whereas
the
incarnating
ego
dresses
itself
up
in
new
garments
entirely
different
from
those
of
its
previous
incarnations
and
in
which
all
except
its
spiritual
prototype
is
doomed
to
a
change
so
radical
as
to
leave
no
trace
behind
enq
how
so
can
my
conscious
terrestrial
perish
not
only
for
a
time
like
the
consciousness
of
the
materialist
but
so
entirely
as
to
leave
no
trace
behind
theo
according
to
the
teaching
it
must
so
perish
and
in
its
fullness
all
except
the
principle
which
having
united
itself
with
the
monad
has
thereby
become
a
purely
spiritual
and
indestructible
essence
one
with
it
in
the
eternity
but
in
the
case
of
an
materialist
in
whose
personal
no
buddhi
has
ever
reflected
itself
how
can
the
latter
carry
away
into
the
eternity
one
particle
of
that
terrestrial
personality
your
spiritual
is
immortal
but
from
your
present
self
it
can
carry
away
into
eternity
that
only
which
has
become
worthy
of
immortality
namely
the
aroma
alone
of
the
flower
that
has
been
mown
by
death
enq
well
and
the
flower
the
terrestrial
theo
the
flower
as
all
past
and
future
flowers
which
have
blossomed
and
will
have
to
blossom
on
the
mother
bough
the
all
children
of
one
root
or
return
to
dust
your
present
as
you
yourself
know
is
not
the
body
now
sitting
before
me
nor
yet
is
it
what
i
would
call
but
enq
but
this
does
not
explain
to
me
at
all
why
you
call
life
after
death
immortal
infinite
and
real
and
the
terrestrial
life
a
simple
phantom
or
illusion
since
even
that
life
has
limits
however
much
wider
they
may
be
than
those
of
terrestrial
life
theo
no
doubt
the
spiritual
ego
of
man
moves
in
eternity
like
a
pendulum
between
the
hours
of
birth
and
death
but
if
these
hours
marking
the
periods
of
life
terrestrial
and
life
spiritual
are
limited
in
their
duration
and
if
the
very
number
of
such
stages
in
eternity
between
sleep
and
awakening
illusion
and
reality
has
its
beginning
and
its
end
on
the
other
hand
the
spiritual
pilgrim
is
eternal
therefore
are
the
hours
of
his
life
when
disembodied
he
stands
face
to
face
with
truth
and
not
the
mirages
of
his
transitory
earthly
existences
during
the
period
of
that
pilgrimage
which
we
call
cycle
of
only
reality
in
our
conception
such
intervals
their
limitation
notwithstanding
do
not
prevent
the
ego
while
ever
perfecting
itself
from
following
undeviatingly
though
gradually
and
slowly
the
path
to
its
last
transformation
when
that
ego
having
reached
its
goal
becomes
a
divine
being
these
intervals
and
stages
help
towards
this
final
result
instead
of
hindering
it
and
without
such
limited
intervals
the
divine
ego
could
never
reach
its
ultimate
goal
i
have
given
you
once
already
a
familiar
illustration
by
comparing
the
or
the
to
an
actor
and
its
numerous
and
various
incarnations
to
the
parts
it
plays
will
you
call
these
parts
or
their
costumes
the
individuality
of
the
actor
himself
like
that
actor
the
ego
is
forced
to
play
during
the
cycle
of
necessity
up
to
the
very
threshold
of
many
parts
such
as
may
be
unpleasant
to
it
but
as
the
bee
collects
its
honey
from
every
flower
leaving
the
rest
as
food
for
the
earthly
worms
so
does
our
spiritual
individuality
whether
we
call
it
sutratma
or
ego
collecting
from
every
terrestrial
personality
into
which
karma
forces
it
to
incarnate
the
nectar
alone
of
the
spiritual
qualities
and
it
unites
all
these
into
one
whole
and
emerges
from
its
chrysalis
as
the
glorified
dhyan
chohan
so
much
the
worse
for
those
terrestrial
personalities
from
which
it
could
collect
nothing
such
personalities
can
not
assuredly
outlive
consciously
their
terrestrial
existence
enq
thus
then
it
seems
that
for
the
terrestrial
personality
immortality
is
still
conditional
is
then
immortality
itself
unconditional
theo
not
at
all
but
immortality
can
not
touch
the
for
all
that
which
exists
as
sat
or
emanates
from
sat
immortality
and
eternity
are
absolute
matter
is
the
opposite
pole
of
spirit
and
yet
the
two
are
one
the
essence
of
all
this
spirit
force
and
matter
or
the
three
in
one
is
as
endless
as
it
is
beginningless
but
the
form
acquired
by
this
triple
unity
during
its
incarnations
its
externality
is
certainly
only
the
illusion
of
our
personal
conceptions
therefore
do
we
call
nirvana
and
the
universal
life
alone
a
reality
while
relegating
the
terrestrial
life
its
terrestrial
personality
included
and
even
its
devachanic
existence
to
the
phantom
realm
of
illusion
enq
but
why
in
such
a
case
call
sleep
the
reality
and
waking
the
illusion
theo
it
is
simply
a
comparison
made
to
facilitate
the
grasping
of
the
subject
and
from
the
standpoint
of
terrestrial
conceptions
it
is
a
very
correct
one
enq
and
still
i
can
not
understand
if
the
life
to
come
is
based
on
justice
and
the
merited
retribution
for
all
our
terrestrial
suffering
how
in
the
case
of
materialists
many
of
whom
are
really
honest
and
charitable
men
there
should
remain
of
their
personality
nothing
but
the
refuse
of
a
faded
flower
theo
no
one
ever
said
such
a
thing
no
materialist
however
unbelieving
can
die
for
ever
in
the
fulness
of
his
spiritual
individuality
what
was
said
is
that
consciousness
can
disappear
either
fully
or
partially
in
the
case
of
a
materialist
so
that
no
conscious
remains
of
his
personality
survive
enq
but
surely
this
is
annihilation
theo
certainly
not
one
can
sleep
a
dead
sleep
and
miss
several
stations
during
a
long
railway
journey
without
the
slightest
recollection
or
consciousness
and
awake
at
another
station
and
continue
the
journey
past
innumerable
other
till
the
end
of
the
journey
or
the
goal
is
reached
three
kinds
of
sleep
were
mentioned
to
you
the
dreamless
the
chaotic
and
the
one
which
is
so
real
that
to
the
sleeping
man
his
dreams
become
full
realities
if
you
believe
in
the
latter
why
you
believe
in
the
former
according
to
the
after
life
a
man
has
believed
in
and
expected
such
is
the
life
he
will
have
he
who
expected
no
life
to
come
will
have
an
absolute
blank
amounting
to
annihilation
in
the
interval
between
the
two
rebirths
this
is
just
the
carrying
out
of
the
programme
we
spoke
of
a
programme
created
by
the
materialists
themselves
but
there
are
various
kinds
of
materialists
as
you
say
a
selfish
wicked
egoist
one
who
never
shed
a
tear
for
anyone
but
himself
thus
adding
entire
indifference
to
the
whole
world
to
his
unbelief
must
at
the
threshold
of
death
drop
his
personality
for
ever
this
personality
having
no
tendrils
of
sympathy
for
the
world
around
and
hence
nothing
to
hook
on
to
sutratma
it
follows
that
with
the
last
breath
every
connection
between
the
two
is
broken
there
being
no
devachan
for
such
a
materialist
the
sutratma
will
reincarnate
almost
immediately
but
those
materialists
who
erred
in
nothing
but
their
disbelief
will
oversleep
but
one
station
and
the
time
will
come
when
that
will
perceive
himself
in
the
eternity
and
perhaps
repent
that
he
lost
even
one
day
one
station
from
the
life
eternal
enq
still
would
it
not
be
more
correct
to
say
that
death
is
birth
into
a
new
life
or
a
return
once
more
into
eternity
theo
you
may
if
you
like
only
remember
that
births
differ
and
that
there
are
births
of
beings
which
are
of
nature
moreover
with
your
western
fixed
ideas
about
material
life
the
words
and
are
quite
inapplicable
to
the
pure
subjective
state
of
existence
it
is
just
because
save
in
a
few
philosophers
who
are
not
read
by
the
many
and
who
themselves
are
too
confused
to
present
a
distinct
picture
of
it
it
is
just
because
your
western
ideas
of
life
and
death
have
finally
become
so
narrow
that
on
the
one
hand
they
have
led
to
crass
materialism
and
on
the
other
to
the
still
more
material
conception
of
the
other
life
which
the
spiritualists
have
formulated
in
their
there
the
souls
of
men
eat
drink
marry
and
live
in
a
paradise
quite
as
sensual
as
that
of
mohammed
but
even
less
philosophical
nor
are
the
average
conceptions
of
the
uneducated
christians
any
better
being
if
possible
still
more
material
what
between
truncated
angels
brass
trumpets
golden
harps
and
material
the
christian
heaven
seems
like
a
fairy
scene
at
a
christmas
pantomime
it
is
because
of
these
narrow
conceptions
that
you
find
such
difficulty
in
understanding
it
is
just
because
the
life
of
the
disembodied
soul
while
possessing
all
the
vividness
of
reality
as
in
certain
dreams
is
devoid
of
every
grossly
objective
form
of
terrestrial
life
that
the
eastern
philosophers
have
compared
it
with
visions
during
sleep
definite
words
for
definite
things
enq
you
think
it
is
because
there
are
no
definite
and
fixed
terms
to
indicate
each
in
man
that
such
a
confusion
of
ideas
arises
in
our
minds
with
respect
to
the
respective
functions
of
these
theo
i
have
thought
of
it
myself
the
whole
trouble
has
arisen
from
this
we
have
started
our
expositions
of
and
discussion
about
the
using
their
sanskrit
names
instead
of
coining
immediately
for
the
use
of
theosophists
their
equivalents
in
english
we
must
try
and
remedy
this
now
enq
you
will
do
well
as
it
may
avoid
further
confusion
no
two
theosophical
writers
it
seems
to
me
have
hitherto
agreed
to
call
the
same
by
the
same
name
theo
the
confusion
is
more
apparent
than
real
however
i
have
heard
some
of
our
theosophists
express
surprise
at
and
criticize
several
essays
speaking
of
these
but
when
examined
there
was
no
worse
mistake
in
them
than
that
of
using
the
word
to
cover
the
three
principles
without
specifying
the
distinctions
the
first
as
positively
the
clearest
of
our
theosophical
writers
sinnett
has
some
comprehensive
and
passages
on
the
his
real
idea
has
also
been
misconceived
by
some
owing
to
his
using
the
word
in
a
general
sense
yet
here
are
a
few
passages
which
will
show
to
you
how
clear
and
comprehensive
is
all
that
he
writes
on
the
subject
human
soul
once
launched
on
the
streams
of
evolution
as
a
human
individuality
passes
through
alternate
periods
of
physical
and
relatively
spiritual
existence
it
passes
from
the
one
plane
or
stratum
or
condition
of
nature
to
the
other
under
the
guidance
of
its
karmic
affinities
living
in
incarnations
the
life
which
its
karma
has
modifying
its
progress
within
the
limitations
of
circumstances
and
fresh
karma
by
its
use
or
abuse
of
opportunities
returns
to
spiritual
existence
devachan
after
each
physical
life
the
intervening
region
of
rest
and
refreshment
and
for
the
gradual
absorption
into
its
essence
as
so
much
cosmic
progress
of
the
experience
gained
or
during
physical
existence
this
view
of
the
matter
will
moreover
have
suggested
many
collateral
inferences
to
anyone
thinking
over
the
subject
for
instance
that
the
transfer
of
consciousness
from
the
kamaloca
to
the
devachanic
stage
of
this
progression
would
necessarily
be
gradual
that
in
truth
no
line
separates
the
varieties
of
spiritual
conditions
that
even
the
spiritual
and
physical
planes
as
psychic
faculties
in
living
people
show
are
not
so
hopelessly
walled
off
from
one
another
as
materialistic
theories
would
suggest
that
all
states
of
nature
are
all
around
us
simultaneously
and
appeal
to
different
perceptive
faculties
and
so
on
it
is
clear
that
during
physical
existence
people
who
possess
psychic
faculties
remain
in
connection
with
the
planes
of
superphysical
consciousness
and
although
most
people
may
not
be
endowed
with
such
faculties
we
all
as
the
phenomena
of
sleep
even
and
especially
those
of
somnambulism
or
mesmerism
show
are
capable
of
entering
into
conditions
of
consciousness
that
the
five
physical
senses
have
nothing
to
do
with
souls
within
not
as
it
were
altogether
adrift
in
the
ocean
of
matter
we
clearly
retain
some
surviving
interest
or
rights
in
the
shore
from
which
for
a
time
we
have
floated
off
the
process
of
incarnation
therefore
is
not
fully
described
when
we
speak
of
an
existence
on
the
physical
and
spiritual
planes
and
thus
picture
the
soul
as
a
complete
entity
slipping
entirely
from
the
one
state
of
existence
to
the
other
the
more
correct
definitions
of
the
process
would
probably
represent
incarnation
as
taking
place
on
this
physical
plane
of
nature
by
reason
of
an
efflux
emanating
from
the
soul
the
spiritual
realm
would
all
the
while
be
the
proper
habitat
of
the
soul
which
would
never
entirely
quit
it
that
portion
of
the
soul
which
abides
permanently
on
the
spiritual
plane
may
perhaps
be
spoken
of
as
the
higher
this
is
atma
and
of
course
it
is
as
sinnett
says
even
more
it
can
never
be
under
any
circumstances
even
to
the
highest
spiritual
perception
for
or
the
is
really
brahma
the
absolute
and
indistinguishable
from
it
in
hours
of
the
higher
spiritual
consciousness
of
the
initiate
is
entirely
absorbed
in
the
one
essence
which
is
atman
and
therefore
being
one
with
the
whole
there
can
be
nothing
objective
for
it
now
some
of
our
theosophists
have
got
into
the
habit
of
using
the
words
and
as
synonymous
of
associating
the
term
with
only
higher
individual
or
even
personal
or
whereas
this
term
ought
never
to
be
applied
except
the
one
universal
hence
the
confusion
speaking
of
manas
the
body
we
may
call
connecting
it
with
the
buddhic
ego
never
the
for
even
buddhi
the
soul
is
not
the
self
but
the
vehicle
only
of
self
all
the
other
as
the
self
and
never
to
be
spoken
or
written
of
without
their
qualifying
and
characteristic
adjectives
thus
in
this
most
excellent
essay
on
the
self
this
term
is
applied
to
the
or
of
course
in
conjunction
with
manas
as
without
such
union
there
would
be
no
principle
or
element
in
the
spiritual
soul
and
has
in
consequence
given
rise
to
just
such
misunderstandings
the
statement
that
child
does
not
acquire
its
become
a
morally
responsible
being
capable
of
generating
seven
years
old
proves
what
is
meant
therein
by
the
higher
self
therefore
the
able
author
is
quite
justified
in
explaining
that
after
the
has
passed
into
the
human
being
and
saturated
the
some
of
the
finer
organizations
its
consciousness
with
psychic
faculties
may
indeed
perceive
this
higher
self
through
their
finer
senses
from
time
to
but
so
are
those
who
limit
the
term
to
the
universal
divine
principle
in
misunderstanding
him
for
when
we
read
without
being
prepared
for
this
shifting
of
metaphysical
terms
that
while
manifesting
on
the
physical
plane
the
higher
self
still
remains
a
conscious
spiritual
ego
on
the
corresponding
plane
of
are
apt
to
see
in
the
of
this
sentence
and
in
the
spiritual
ego
or
rather
and
forthwith
to
criticise
the
whole
thing
as
incorrect
to
avoid
henceforth
such
misrepresentations
i
propose
to
translate
literally
from
the
occult
eastern
terms
their
equivalents
in
english
and
offer
these
for
future
use
atma
the
inseparable
ray
of
the
universal
the
higher

one
self
it
is
the
god

within

who
succeeds
in
saturating
his
with

in
close

it
is
no

all
but
only

called
independently
of

the

only
the

merged

materialist

supposed
to
have
in
him
an

capacities
it
is
the

the
the
physical

in
conjunction
with
his

animal
instincts
passions
the

etc
it
is
called

consists
of
the

through
the
physical

and
its

strictly
speaking

enq
this
division
being
so
much
simplified
in
its
combinations

answer
better
i
believe
the

is
much
too
metaphysical

outsiders
as
well
as
theosophists
would
agree
to
it
it

certainly
make

much
more

to
convey
the

idea

it
was
awkward
and
open
to
the
criticism

the
essential
idea
was
that

of

from

for
to
this
day
there
never
existed
any
such
terms
in

theosophist
having
to
coin
his
own
terms
to
render
his
thought
it
is
nigh
time
then
to
settle
on
some
definite
nomenclature
x
on
the
nature
of
our
thinking
principle
the
mystery
of
the
ego
enq
i
perceive
in
the
quotation
you
brought
forward
a
little
while
ago
from
the
a
discrepancy
that
i
would
like
to
hear
explained
it
is
there
stated
that
the
with
every
new
incarnation
and
yet
it
is
asserted
that
the
reflection
of
the
past
lives
which
we
are
told
are
entirely
made
up
of
skandhas
at
the
present
moment
i
am
not
quite
clear
in
my
mind
as
to
what
it
is
precisely
that
survives
and
i
would
like
to
have
it
explained
what
is
it
is
it
only
that
or
those
skandhas
or
always
that
same
ego
the
manas
theo
i
have
just
explained
that
the
reincarnating
principle
or
that
which
we
call
the
man
is
indestructible
throughout
the
life
cycle
indestructible
as
a
thinking
and
even
as
an
ethereal
form
the
is
only
the
spiritualised
during
the
devachanic
period
of
the
or
which
the
identifies
itself
during
that
period
since
the
latter
is
but
the
continuation
of
the
so
to
say
the
very
acme
and
pitch
in
an
unbroken
series
of
the
few
happy
moments
in
that
now
past
existence
the
has
to
identify
itself
with
the
consciousness
of
that
life
if
anything
shall
remain
of
it
enq
this
means
that
the
notwithstanding
its
divine
nature
passes
every
such
period
between
two
incarnations
in
a
state
of
mental
obscuration
or
temporary
insanity
theo
you
may
regard
it
as
you
like
believing
that
outside
the
one
reality
nothing
is
better
than
a
passing
whole
universe
do
not
view
it
as
insanity
but
as
a
very
natural
sequence
or
development
of
the
terrestrial
life
what
is
life
a
bundle
of
the
most
varied
experiences
of
daily
changing
ideas
emotions
and
opinions
in
our
youth
we
are
often
enthusiastically
devoted
to
an
ideal
to
some
hero
or
heroine
whom
we
try
to
follow
and
revive
a
few
years
later
when
the
freshness
of
our
youthful
feelings
has
faded
out
and
sobered
down
we
are
the
first
to
laugh
at
our
fancies
and
yet
there
was
a
day
when
we
had
so
thoroughly
identified
our
own
personality
with
that
of
the
ideal
in
our
if
it
was
that
of
a
living
the
former
was
entirely
merged
and
lost
in
the
latter
can
it
be
said
of
a
man
of
fifty
that
he
is
the
same
being
that
he
was
at
twenty
the
man
is
the
same
the
outward
living
personality
is
completely
transformed
and
changed
would
you
also
call
these
changes
in
the
human
mental
states
insanity
enq
how
would
name
them
and
especially
how
would
you
explain
the
permanence
of
one
and
the
evanescence
of
the
other
theo
we
have
our
own
doctrine
ready
and
to
us
it
offers
no
difficulty
the
clue
lies
in
the
double
consciousness
of
our
mind
and
also
in
the
dual
nature
of
the
mental
there
is
a
spiritual
consciousness
the
manasic
mind
illumined
by
the
light
of
buddhi
that
which
subjectively
perceives
abstractions
and
the
sentient
consciousness
the
lower
light
inseparable
from
our
physical
brain
and
senses
this
latter
consciousness
is
held
in
subjection
by
the
brain
and
physical
senses
and
being
in
its
turn
equally
dependent
on
them
must
of
course
fade
out
and
finally
die
with
the
disappearance
of
the
brain
and
physical
senses
it
is
only
the
former
kind
of
consciousness
whose
root
lies
in
eternity
which
survives
and
lives
for
ever
and
may
therefore
be
regarded
as
immortal
everything
else
belongs
to
passing
illusions
enq
what
do
you
really
understand
by
illusion
in
this
case
theo
it
is
very
well
described
in
the
essay
on
higher
says
its
author
theory
we
are
considering
the
interchange
of
ideas
between
the
and
the
lower
self
harmonizes
very
well
with
the
treatment
of
this
world
in
which
we
live
as
a
phenomenal
world
of
illusion
the
spiritual
plans
of
nature
being
on
the
other
hand
the
noumenal
world
or
plane
of
reality
that
region
of
nature
in
which
so
to
speak
the
permanent
soul
is
rooted
is
more
real
than
that
in
which
its
transitory
blossoms
appear
for
a
brief
space
to
wither
and
fall
to
pieces
while
the
plant
recovers
energy
for
sending
forth
a
fresh
flower
supposing
flowers
only
were
perceptible
to
ordinary
senses
and
their
roots
existed
in
a
state
of
nature
intangible
and
invisible
to
us
philosophers
in
such
a
world
who
divined
that
there
were
such
things
as
roots
in
another
plane
of
existence
would
be
apt
to
say
of
the
flowers
these
are
not
the
real
plants
they
are
of
no
relative
importance
merely
illusive
phenomena
of
the
this
is
what
i
mean
the
world
in
which
blossom
the
transitory
and
evanescent
flowers
of
personal
lives
is
not
the
real
permanent
world
but
that
one
in
which
we
find
the
root
of
consciousness
that
root
which
is
beyond
illusion
and
dwells
in
the
eternity
enq
what
do
you
mean
by
the
root
dwelling
in
eternity
theo
i
mean
by
this
root
the
thinking
entity
the
ego
which
incarnates
whether
we
regard
it
as
an
or
a
force
of
that
which
falls
under
our
sensuous
perceptions
only
what
grows
directly
from
or
is
attached
to
this
invisible
root
above
can
partake
of
its
immortal
life
hence
every
noble
thought
idea
and
aspiration
of
the
personality
it
informs
proceeding
from
and
fed
by
this
root
must
become
permanent
as
to
the
physical
consciousness
as
it
is
a
quality
of
the
sentient
but
lower
or
animal
instinct
illuminated
by
the
lower
reflection
or
the
human
must
disappear
that
which
displays
activity
while
the
body
is
asleep
or
paralysed
is
the
higher
consciousness
our
memory
registering
but
feebly
and
experiences
and
often
failing
to
be
even
slightly
impressed
by
them
enq
but
how
is
it
that
manas
although
you
call
it
a
is
so
weak
during
its
incarnations
as
to
be
actually
conquered
and
fettered
by
its
body
theo
i
might
retort
with
the
same
question
and
ask
is
it
that
he
whom
you
regard
as
god
of
and
the
one
living
god
so
as
to
allow
evil
or
the
devil
to
have
the
best
of
as
much
as
of
all
his
creatures
whether
while
he
remains
in
heaven
or
during
the
time
he
was
incarnated
on
this
earth
you
are
sure
to
reply
again
is
a
mystery
and
we
are
forbidden
to
pry
into
the
mysteries
of
not
being
forbidden
to
do
so
by
our
religious
philosophy
i
answer
your
question
that
unless
a
god
descends
as
an
no
divine
principle
can
be
otherwise
than
cramped
and
paralysed
by
turbulent
animal
matter
heterogeneity
will
always
have
the
upper
hand
over
homogeneity
on
this
plane
of
illusions
and
the
nearer
an
essence
is
to
its
primordial
homogeneity
the
more
difficult
it
is
for
the
latter
to
assert
itself
on
earth
spiritual
and
divine
powers
lie
dormant
in
every
human
being
and
the
wider
the
sweep
of
his
spiritual
vision
the
mightier
will
be
the
god
within
him
but
as
few
men
can
feel
that
god
and
since
as
an
average
rule
deity
is
always
bound
and
limited
in
our
thought
by
earlier
conceptions
those
ideas
that
are
inculcated
in
us
from
childhood
therefore
it
is
so
difficult
for
you
to
understand
our
philosophy
enq
and
is
it
this
ego
of
ours
which
is
our
god
theo
not
at
all
is
not
the
universal
deity
but
only
a
spark
from
the
one
ocean
of
divine
fire
our
god
us
or
father
in
is
what
we
call
the
self
our
incarnating
ego
was
a
god
in
its
origin
as
were
all
the
primeval
emanations
of
the
one
unknown
principle
but
since
its
into
matter
having
to
incarnate
throughout
the
cycle
in
succession
from
first
to
last
it
is
no
longer
a
free
and
happy
god
but
a
poor
pilgrim
on
his
way
to
regain
that
which
he
has
lost
i
can
answer
your
more
fully
by
repeating
what
is
said
of
the
inner
man
in
isis
unveiled
vol
ii
the
remotest
antiquity
as
a
whole
always
been
convinced
of
the
existence
of
a
personal
spiritual
entity
within
the
personal
physical
this
inner
entity
was
more
or
less
divine
according
to
its
proximity
to
the
the
closer
the
union
the
more
serene
destiny
the
less
dangerous
the
external
conditions
this
belief
is
neither
bigotry
nor
superstition
only
an
instinctive
feeling
of
the
proximity
of
another
spiritual
and
invisible
world
which
though
it
be
subjective
to
the
senses
of
the
outward
man
is
perfectly
objective
to
the
inner
ego
furthermore
they
believed
that
are
external
and
internal
conditions
which
affect
the
determination
of
our
will
upon
our
they
rejected
fatalism
for
fatalism
implies
a
blind
course
of
some
still
blinder
power
but
they
believed
in
or
which
from
birth
to
death
every
man
is
weaving
thread
by
thread
around
himself
as
a
spider
does
his
cobweb
and
this
destiny
is
guided
by
that
presence
termed
by
some
the
guardian
angel
or
our
more
intimate
astral
inner
man
who
is
but
too
often
the
evil
genius
of
the
man
of
flesh
or
the
both
these
lead
on
man
but
one
of
them
must
prevail
and
from
the
very
beginning
of
the
invisible
affray
the
stern
and
implacable
of
compensation
and
steps
in
and
takes
its
course
following
faithfully
the
fluctuations
of
the
conflict
when
the
last
strand
is
woven
and
man
is
seemingly
enwrapped
in
the
network
of
his
own
doing
then
he
finds
himself
completely
under
the
empire
of
this
destiny
it
then
either
fixes
him
like
the
inert
shell
against
the
immovable
rock
or
like
a
feather
carries
him
away
in
a
whirlwind
raised
by
his
own
such
is
the
destiny
of
the
true
ego
not
the
automaton
the
that
goes
by
that
name
it
is
for
him
to
become
the
conqueror
over
matter
the
complex
nature
of
manas
enq
but
you
wanted
to
tell
me
something
of
the
essential
nature
of
manas
and
of
the
relation
in
which
the
skandhas
of
physical
man
stand
to
it
theo
it
is
this
nature
mysterious
protean
beyond
any
grasp
and
almost
shadowy
in
its
correlations
with
the
other
principles
that
is
most
difficult
to
realise
and
still
more
so
to
explain
manas
is
a
and
yet
it
is
an
and
individuality
or
ego
he
is
a
and
yet
he
is
doomed
to
an
endless
cycle
of
incarnations
for
each
of
which
he
is
made
responsible
and
for
each
of
which
he
has
to
suffer
all
this
seems
as
contradictory
as
it
is
puzzling
nevertheless
there
are
hundreds
of
people
even
in
europe
who
realise
all
this
perfectly
for
they
comprehend
the
ego
not
only
in
its
integrity
but
in
its
many
aspects
finally
if
i
would
make
myself
comprehensible
i
must
begin
by
the
beginning
and
give
you
the
genealogy
of
this
ego
in
a
few
lines
enq
say
on
theo
try
to
imagine
a
a
celestial
being
whether
we
call
it
by
one
name
or
another
divine
in
its
essential
nature
yet
not
pure
enough
to
be
with
all
and
having
in
order
to
achieve
this
to
so
purify
its
nature
as
to
finally
gain
that
goal
it
can
do
so
only
by
passing
and
spiritually
and
physically
through
every
experience
and
feeling
that
exists
in
the
manifold
or
differentiated
universe
it
has
therefore
after
having
gained
such
experience
in
the
lower
kingdoms
and
having
ascended
higher
and
still
higher
with
every
rung
on
the
ladder
of
being
to
pass
through
every
experience
on
the
human
planes
in
its
very
essence
it
is
thought
and
is
therefore
called
in
its
plurality
sons
of
the
universal
this
is
what
we
theosophists
call
the
human
ego
the
thinking
entity
imprisoned
in
a
case
of
flesh
and
bones
this
is
surely
a
spiritual
entity
not
and
such
entities
are
the
incarnating
egos
that
inform
the
bundle
of
animal
matter
called
mankind
and
whose
names
are
or
but
once
imprisoned
or
incarnate
their
essence
becomes
dual
that
is
to
say
the
of
the
eternal
divine
mind
considered
as
individual
entities
assume
a
attribute
which
is
their
inherent
characteristic
mind
higher
and
the
human
quality
of
thinking
or
animal
cogitation
rationalised
owing
to
the
superiority
of
the
human
brain
the
or
lower
manas
one
gravitates
toward
buddhi
the
other
tending
downward
to
the
seat
of
passions
and
animal
desires
the
latter
have
no
room
in
devachan
nor
can
they
associate
with
the
divine
triad
which
ascends
as
one
into
mental
bliss
yet
it
is
the
ego
the
manasic
entity
which
is
held
responsible
for
all
the
sins
of
the
lower
attributes
just
as
a
parent
is
answerable
for
the
transgressions
of
his
child
so
long
as
the
latter
remains
irresponsible
enq
is
this
the
theo
it
is
when
therefore
it
is
stated
that
the
dies
with
the
body
it
does
not
state
all
the
body
which
was
only
the
objective
symbol
of
or
fades
away
with
all
its
material
skandhas
which
are
the
visible
expressions
thereof
but
all
that
which
constituted
during
life
the
bundle
of
experiences
the
noblest
aspirations
undying
affections
and
nature
of
or
clings
for
the
time
of
the
devachanic
period
to
the
ego
which
is
identified
with
the
spiritual
portion
of
that
terrestrial
entity
now
passed
away
out
of
sight
the
actor
is
so
imbued
with
the
just
played
by
him
that
he
dreams
of
it
during
the
whole
devachanic
night
which
continues
till
the
hour
strikes
for
him
to
return
to
the
stage
of
life
to
enact
another
part
enq
but
how
is
it
that
this
doctrine
which
you
say
is
as
old
as
thinking
men
has
found
no
room
say
in
christian
theology
theo
you
are
mistaken
it
has
only
theology
has
disfigured
it
out
of
all
recognition
as
it
has
many
other
doctrines
theology
calls
the
ego
the
angel
that
god
gives
us
at
the
moment
of
our
birth
take
care
of
our
instead
of
holding
that
responsible
for
the
transgressions
of
the
poor
helpless
it
is
the
latter
which
according
to
theological
logic
is
punished
for
all
the
sins
of
both
flesh
and
mind
it
is
the
soul
the
immaterial
of
god
and
his
which
by
some
most
amazing
intellectual
jugglery
is
doomed
to
burn
in
a
material
hell
without
ever
being
consumed
while
the
escapes
scot
free
after
folding
his
white
pinions
and
wetting
them
with
a
few
tears
aye
these
are
our
spirits
the
of
who
are
sent
bishop
mant
tells
to
fulfil
good
for
heirs
for
us
they
still
grieve
when
we
sin
rejoice
when
we
repent
yet
it
becomes
evident
that
if
all
the
bishops
the
world
over
were
asked
to
define
once
for
all
what
they
mean
by
and
its
functions
they
would
be
as
unable
to
do
so
as
to
show
us
any
shadow
of
logic
in
the
orthodox
belief
the
doctrine
is
taught
in
gospel
enq
to
this
the
adherents
to
this
belief
might
answer
that
if
even
the
orthodox
dogma
does
promise
the
impenitent
sinner
and
materialist
a
bad
time
of
it
in
a
rather
too
realistic
inferno
it
gives
them
on
the
other
hand
a
chance
for
repentance
to
the
last
minute
nor
do
they
teach
annihilation
or
loss
of
personality
which
is
all
the
same
theo
if
the
church
teaches
nothing
of
the
kind
on
the
other
hand
jesus
does
and
that
is
something
to
those
at
least
who
place
christ
higher
than
christianity
enq
does
christ
teach
anything
of
the
sort
theo
he
does
and
every
occultist
and
even
kabalist
will
tell
you
so
christ
or
the
fourth
gospel
at
any
rate
teaches
as
also
the
annihilation
of
the
personality
if
you
but
forget
the
dead
letter
and
hold
to
the
esoteric
spirit
remember
verses
and
in
chapter
xv
of
john
what
does
the
parable
speak
about
if
not
of
the
in
man
is
the
spiritual
ego
or
christos
the
vine
while
the
animal
and
vital
soul
the
is
the
am
the
vine
and
my
father
is
the
husbandman
every
branch
in
me
that
beareth
not
fruit
he
taketh
away
as
the
branch
can
not
bear
fruit
of
itself
except
it
abide
in
the
vine
no
more
can
ye
except
ye
abide
in
me
i
am
the
are
the
branches
if
a
man
abide
not
in
me
he
is
cast
forth
as
a
branch
and
is
and
cast
into
the
fire
and
now
we
explain
it
in
this
way
disbelieving
in
the
which
theology
discovers
as
underlying
the
threat
to
the
we
say
that
the
means
atma
the
symbol
for
the
infinite
impersonal
principle
while
the
vine
stands
for
the
spiritual
soul
and
each
represents
a
new
incarnation
enq
but
what
proofs
have
you
to
support
such
an
arbitrary
interpretation
theo
universal
symbology
is
a
warrant
for
its
correctness
and
that
it
is
not
arbitrary
hermas
says
of
that
he
the
vineyard
he
created
mankind
in
the
it
is
shown
that
the
aged
of
the
aged
or
the
face
plants
a
vineyard
the
latter
typifying
mankind
and
a
vine
meaning
life
the
spirit
of
is
therefore
shown
as
washing
his
garments
in
from
above
from
the
creation
of
the
world
and
king
is
the
ego
purified
washing
his
his

adam

is
the

and
is

noah
also
plants
a
allegorical
of
future
humanity
as
a
consequence
of
the
adoption
of
the
same
allegory
we
find
it
reproduced
in
the
nazarene
seven
vines
are
seven
vines
are
our
seven
races
with
their
seven

these
kabalistic
metaphors
are
thus
naturally
repeated
in
the
according
to
let
us
not
forget
that
in
the
human
according
to
those
philosophies
which
ignore
our
septenary
ego
or
is
called
the
or
the
son
of

and

is
the
adopted
son
of
king
and
queen
esoteric
equivalents
for
atma
and
buddhi
says
an
occult
work
he
is
the
of
plato
who
crucifies
himself
in
or
the
duration
of
the
life
cycle
for
the
redemption
of
matter
this
he
does
by
incarnating
over
and
over
again
thus
leading
mankind
onward
to
perfection
and
making
thereby
room
for
lower
forms
to
develop
into
higher
not
for
one
life
does
he
cease
progressing
himself
and
helping
all
physical
nature
to
progress
even
the
occasional
very
rare
event
of
his
losing
one
of
his
personalities
in
the
case
of
the
latter
being
entirely
devoid
of
even
a
spark
of
spirituality
helps
toward
his
individual
progress
enq
but
surely
if
the
is
held
responsible
for
the
transgressions
of
its
personalities
it
has
to
answer
also
for
the
loss
or
rather
the
complete
annihilation
of
one
of
such
theo
not
at
all
unless
it
has
done
nothing
to
avert
this
dire
fate
but
if
all
its
efforts
notwithstanding
its
voice
of
our
was
unable
to
penetrate
through
the
wall
of
matter
then
the
obtuseness
of
the
latter
proceeding
from
the
imperfect
nature
of
the
material
is
classed
with
other
failures
of
nature
the
ego
is
sufficiently
punished
by
the
loss
of
devachan
and
especially
by
having
to
incarnate
almost
immediately
enq
this
doctrine
of
the
possibility
of
losing
personality
do
you
call
it
against
the
ideal
theories
of
both
christians
and
spiritualists
though
swedenborg
adopts
it
to
a
certain
extent
in
what
he
calls
they
will
never
accept
it
theo
this
can
in
no
way
alter
a
fact
in
nature
if
it
be
a
fact
or
prevent
such
a
thing
occasionally
taking
place
the
universe
and
everything
in
it
moral
mental
physical
psychic
or
spiritual
is
built
on
a
perfect
law
of
equilibrium
and
harmony
as
said
before
isis
the
centripetal
force
could
not
manifest
itself
without
the
centrifugal
in
the
harmonious
revolutions
of
the
spheres
and
all
forms
and
their
progress
are
the
products
of
this
dual
force
in
nature
now
the
spirit
or
is
the
centrifugal
and
the
soul
the
centripetal
spiritual
energy
and
to
produce
one
result
they
have
to
be
in
perfect
union
and
harmony
break
or
damage
the
centripetal
motion
of
the
earthly
soul
tending
toward
the
centre
which
attracts
it
arrest
its
progress
by
clogging
it
with
a
heavier
weight
of
matter
than
it
can
bear
or
than
is
fit
for
the
devachanic
state
and
the
harmony
of
the
whole
will
be
destroyed
personal
life
or
perhaps
rather
its
ideal
reflection
can
only
be
continued
if
sustained
by
the
force
that
is
by
the
close
union
of
and
in
every
or
personal
life
the
least
deviation
from
harmony
damages
it
and
when
it
is
destroyed
beyond
redemption
the
two
forces
separate
at
the
moment
of
death
during
a
brief
interval
the
form
called
indifferently
and
the
spiritual
efflorescence
of
which
attaching
itself
to
the
ego
follows
it
into
devachan
and
gives
to
the
permanent
its
colouring
so
to
speak
is
carried
off
to
remain
in
and
to
be
gradually
annihilated
for
it
is
after
the
death
of
the
utterly
depraved
the
unspiritual
and
the
wicked
beyond
redemption
that
arrives
the
critical
and
supreme
moment
if
during
life
the
ultimate
and
desperate
effort
of
the
inner
self
to
unite
something
of
the
personality
with
itself
and
the
high
glimmering
ray
of
the
divine
buddhi
is
thwarted
if
this
ray
is
allowed
to
be
more
and
more
shut
out
from
the
crust
of
physical
brain
the
spiritual
ego
or
manas
once
freed
from
the
body
remains
severed
entirely
from
the
ethereal
relic
of
the
personality
and
the
latter
or
following
its
earthly
attractions
is
drawn
into
and
remains
in
hades
which
we
call
the
these
are
withered
mentioned
by
jesus
as
being
cut
off
from
the
annihilation
however
is
never
instantaneous
and
may
require
centuries
sometimes
for
its
accomplishment
but
there
the
personality
remains
along
with
the
of
other
more
fortunate
personal
egos
and
becomes
with
them
a
and
an
as
said
in
it
is
these
two
classes
of
the
and
the
which
are
the
leading
on
the
great
spiritual
stage
of
and
you
may
be
sure
of
it
it
is
not
they
who
incarnate
and
therefore
so
few
of
these
departed
know
anything
of
misleading
thereby
the
spiritualists
enq
but
does
not
the
author
of
stand
accused
of
having
preached
against
theo
by
those
who
have
misunderstood
what
was
said
yes
at
the
time
that
work
was
written
was
not
believed
in
by
any
spiritualists
either
english
or
american
and
what
is
said
there
of
was
directed
against
the
french
spiritists
whose
theory
is
as
unphilosophical
and
absurd
as
the
eastern
teaching
is
logical
and
in
its
truth
the
of
the
allan
kardec
school
believe
in
an
arbitrary
and
immediate
with
them
the
dead
father
can
incarnate
in
his
own
unborn
daughter
and
so
on
they
have
neither
devachan
karma
nor
any
philosophy
that
would
warrant
or
prove
the
necessity
of
consecutive
rebirths
but
how
can
the
author
of
argue
against
at
long
intervals
varying
between
and
years
when
it
is
the
fundamental
belief
of
both
buddhists
and
hindus
enq
then
you
reject
the
theories
of
both
the
spiritists
and
the
spiritualists
in
their
entirety
theo
not
in
their
entirety
but
only
with
regard
to
their
respective
fundamental
beliefs
both
rely
on
what
their
tell
them
and
both
disagree
as
much
with
each
other
as
we
theosophists
disagree
with
both
truth
is
one
and
when
we
hear
the
french
spooks
preaching
and
the
english
spooks
denying
and
denouncing
the
doctrine
we
say
that
either
the
french
or
the
english
do
not
know
what
they
are
talking
about
we
believe
with
the
spiritualists
and
the
spiritists
in
the
existence
of
or
invisible
beings
endowed
with
more
or
less
intelligence
but
while
in
our
teachings
their
kinds
and
are
legion
our
opponents
admit
of
no
other
than
human
disembodied
which
to
our
knowledge
are
mostly
kamalokic
shells
enq
you
seem
very
bitter
against
spirits
as
you
have
given
me
your
views
and
your
reasons
for
disbelieving
in
the
materialization
of
and
direct
communication
in
with
the
disembodied
the
of
the
you
mind
enlightening
me
as
to
one
more
fact
why
are
some
theosophists
never
tired
of
saying
how
dangerous
is
intercourse
with
spirits
and
mediumship
have
they
any
particular
reason
for
this
theo
we
must
suppose
so
i
know
i
have
owing
to
my
familiarity
for
over
half
a
century
with
these
invisible
yet
but
too
tangible
and
undeniable
from
the
conscious
elementals
down
to
the
utterly
senseless
and
nondescript
spooks
of
all
kinds
i
claim
a
certain
right
to
my
views
enq
can
you
give
an
instance
or
instances
to
show
why
these
practices
should
be
regarded
as
dangerous
theo
this
would
require
more
time
than
i
can
give
you
every
cause
must
be
judged
by
the
effects
it
produces
go
over
the
history
of
spiritualism
for
the
last
fifty
years
ever
since
its
reappearance
in
this
century
in
judge
for
yourself
whether
it
has
done
its
votaries
more
good
or
harm
pray
understand
me
i
do
not
speak
against
real
spiritualism
but
against
the
modern
movement
which
goes
under
that
name
and
the
philosophy
invented
to
explain
its
phenomena
enq
you
believe
in
their
phenomena
at
all
theo
it
is
because
i
believe
in
them
with
too
good
reason
and
save
some
cases
of
deliberate
fraud
know
them
to
be
as
true
as
that
you
and
i
live
that
all
my
being
revolts
against
them
once
more
i
speak
only
of
physical
not
mental
or
even
psychic
phenomena
like
attracts
like
there
are
several
pure
good
men
and
women
known
to
me
personally
who
have
passed
years
of
their
lives
under
the
direct
guidance
and
even
protection
of
high
whether
disembodied
or
planetary
but
intelligences
are
not
of
the
type
of
the
john
kings
and
the
ernests
who
figure
in
rooms
these
intelligences
guide
and
control
mortals
only
in
rare
and
exceptional
cases
to
which
they
are
attracted
and
magnetically
drawn
by
the
karmic
past
of
the
individual
it
is
not
enough
to
sit
in
order
to
attract
them
that
only
opens
the
door
to
a
swarm
of
good
bad
and
indifferent
to
which
the
medium
becomes
a
slave
for
life
it
is
against
such
promiscuous
mediumship
and
intercourse
with
goblins
that
i
raise
my
voice
not
against
spiritual
mysticism
the
latter
is
ennobling
and
holy
the
former
is
of
just
the
same
nature
as
the
phenomena
of
two
centuries
ago
for
which
so
many
witches
and
wizards
have
been
made
to
suffer
read
glanvil
and
other
authors
on
the
subject
of
witchcraft
and
you
will
find
recorded
there
the
parallels
of
most
if
not
all
of
the
physical
phenomena
of
nineteenth
century
enq
do
you
mean
to
suggest
that
it
is
all
witchcraft
and
nothing
more
theo
what
i
mean
is
that
whether
conscious
or
unconscious
all
this
dealing
with
the
dead
is
and
a
most
dangerous
practice
for
ages
before
moses
such
raising
of
the
dead
was
regarded
by
all
the
intelligent
nations
as
sinful
and
cruel
inasmuch
as
it
disturbs
the
rest
of
the
souls
and
interferes
with
their
evolutionary
development
into
higher
states
the
collective
wisdom
of
all
past
centuries
has
ever
been
loud
in
denouncing
such
practices
finally
i
say
what
i
have
never
ceased
repeating
orally
and
in
print
for
fifteen
years
while
some
of
the
do
not
know
what
they
are
talking
about
repeating
they
find
in
the
and
other
brains
others
are
most
dangerous
and
can
only
lead
one
to
evil
these
are
two
facts
go
into
spiritualistic
circles
of
the
allan
kardec
school
and
you
find
asserting
and
speaking
like
roman
catholics
born
turn
to
the
departed
in
england
and
america
and
you
will
hear
them
denying
through
thick
and
thin
denouncing
those
who
teach
it
and
holding
to
protestant
views
your
best
your
most
powerful
mediums
have
all
suffered
in
health
of
body
and
mind
think
of
the
sad
end
of
charles
foster
who
died
in
an
asylum
a
raving
lunatic
of
slade
an
epileptic
of
best
medium
now
in
to
the
same
look
back
over
the
life
of
home
a
man
whose
mind
was
steeped
in
gall
and
bitterness
who
never
had
a
good
word
to
say
of
anyone
whom
he
suspected
of
possessing
psychic
powers
and
who
slandered
every
other
medium
to
the
bitter
end
this
calvin
of
spiritualism
suffered
for
years
from
a
terrible
spinal
disease
brought
on
by
his
intercourse
with
the
and
died
a
perfect
wreck
think
again
of
the
sad
fate
of
poor
washington
irving
bishop
i
knew
him
in
new
york
when
he
was
fourteen
and
he
was
undeniably
a
medium
it
is
true
that
the
poor
man
stole
a
march
on
his
and
baptized
them
muscular
action
to
the
great
of
all
the
corporations
of
highly
learned
and
scientific
fools
and
to
the
replenishment
of
his
own
pocket
but
mortuis
nil
nisi
his
end
was
a
sad
one
he
had
strenuously
concealed
his
epileptic
first
and
strongest
symptom
of
genuine
who
knows
whether
he
was
dead
or
in
a
trance
when
the
examination
was
performed
his
relatives
insist
that
he
was
alive
if
we
are
to
believe
telegrams
finally
behold
the
veteran
mediums
the
founders
and
prime
movers
of
modern
fox
sisters
after
more
than
forty
years
of
intercourse
with
the
the
latter
have
led
them
to
become
incurable
sots
who
are
now
denouncing
in
public
lectures
their
own
work
and
philosophy
as
a
fraud
what
kind
of
spirits
must
they
be
who
prompted
them
i
ask
you
enq
but
is
your
inference
a
correct
one
theo
what
would
you
infer
if
the
best
pupils
of
a
particular
school
of
singing
broke
down
from
overstrained
sore
throats
that
the
method
followed
was
a
bad
one
so
i
think
the
inference
is
equally
fair
with
regard
to
spiritualism
when
we
see
their
best
mediums
fall
a
prey
to
such
a
fate
we
can
only
say
those
who
are
interested
in
the
question
judge
the
tree
of
spiritualism
by
its
fruits
and
ponder
over
the
lesson
we
theosophists
have
always
regarded
the
spiritualists
as
brothers
having
the
same
mystic
tendency
as
ourselves
but
they
have
always
regarded
us
as
enemies
we
being
in
possession
of
an
older
philosophy
have
tried
to
help
and
warn
them
but
they
have
repaid
us
by
reviling
and
traducing
us
and
our
motives
in
every
possible
way
nevertheless
the
best
english
spiritualists
say
just
as
we
do
wherever
they
treat
of
their
belief
seriously
hear
confessing
this
truth
are
too
much
inclined
to
dwell
exclusively
on
the
intervention
of
external
spirits
in
this
world
of
ours
to
ignore
the
powers
of
the
why
vilify
and
abuse
us
then
for
saying
precisely
the
same
henceforward
we
will
have
nothing
more
to
do
with
spiritualism
and
now
let
us
return
to
footnotes
being
of
nature
according
to
the
eloquent
and
fiery
expression
of
a
modern
english
tertullian
during
the
it
is
the
hierophant
the
who
planted
the
vine
every
symbol
has
seven
keys
to
it
the
discloser
of
the
was
always
called
vol
pp
vol
xi
on
the
mysteries
of
periodical
rebirths
enq
you
mean
then
that
we
have
all
lived
on
earth
before
in
many
past
incarnations
and
shall
go
on
so
living
theo
i
do
the
or
rather
the
cycle
of
conscious
life
begins
with
the
separation
of
the
mortal
into
sexes
and
will
end
with
the
close
of
the
last
generation
of
men
in
the
seventh
round
and
seventh
race
of
mankind
considering
we
are
only
in
the
fourth
round
and
fifth
race
its
duration
is
more
easily
imagined
than
expressed
enq
and
we
keep
on
incarnating
in
new
all
the
time
theo
most
assuredly
so
because
this
or
period
of
incarnation
may
be
best
compared
to
human
life
as
each
such
life
is
composed
of
days
of
activity
separated
by
nights
of
sleep
or
of
inaction
so
in
the
an
active
life
is
followed
by
a
devachanic
rest
enq
and
it
is
this
succession
of
births
that
is
generally
defined
as
theo
just
so
it
is
only
through
these
births
that
the
perpetual
progress
of
the
countless
millions
of
egos
toward
final
perfection
and
final
rest
as
long
as
was
the
period
of
activity
can
be
achieved
enq
and
what
is
it
that
regulates
the
duration
or
special
qualities
of
these
incarnations
theo
karma
the
universal
law
of
retributive
justice
enq
is
it
an
intelligent
law
theo
for
the
materialist
who
calls
the
law
of
periodicity
which
regulates
the
marshalling
of
the
several
bodies
and
all
the
other
laws
in
nature
blind
forces
and
mechanical
laws
no
doubt
karma
would
be
a
law
of
chance
and
no
more
for
us
no
adjective
or
qualification
could
describe
that
which
is
impersonal
and
no
entity
but
a
universal
operative
law
if
you
question
me
about
the
causative
intelligence
in
it
i
must
answer
you
i
do
not
know
but
if
you
ask
me
to
define
its
effects
and
tell
you
what
these
are
in
our
belief
i
may
say
that
the
experience
of
thousands
of
ages
has
shown
us
that
they
are
absolute
and
unerring
and
for
karma
in
its
effects
is
an
unfailing
redresser
of
human
injustice
and
of
all
the
failures
of
nature
a
stern
adjuster
of
wrongs
a
retributive
law
which
rewards
and
punishes
with
equal
impartiality
it
is
in
the
strictest
sense
respecter
of
persons
though
on
the
other
hand
it
can
neither
be
propitiated
nor
turned
aside
by
prayer
this
is
a
belief
common
to
hindus
and
buddhists
who
both
believe
in
karma
enq
in
this
christian
dogmas
contradict
both
and
i
doubt
whether
any
christian
will
accept
the
teaching
theo
no
and
inman
gave
the
reason
for
it
many
years
ago
as
he
puts
it
while
christians
will
accept
any
nonsense
if
promulgated
by
the
church
as
a
matter
of
faith
the
buddhists
hold
that
nothing
which
is
contradicted
by
sound
reason
can
be
a
true
doctrine
of
they
do
not
believe
in
any
pardon
for
their
sins
except
after
an
adequate
and
just
punishment
for
each
evil
deed
or
thought
in
a
future
incarnation
and
a
proportionate
compensation
to
the
parties
injured
enq
where
is
it
so
stated
theo
in
most
of
their
sacred
works
in
the
of
the
you
may
find
the
following
theosophical
tenet
believe
that
every
act
word
or
thought
has
its
consequence
which
will
appear
sooner
or
later
in
the
present
or
in
the
future
state
evil
acts
will
produce
evil
consequences
good
acts
will
produce
good
consequences
prosperity
in
this
world
or
birth
in
heaven
devachan
in
the
future
enq
christians
believe
the
same
thing
they
theo
oh
no
they
believe
in
the
pardon
and
the
remission
of
all
sins
they
are
promised
that
if
they
only
believe
in
the
blood
of
christ
an
victim
in
the
blood
offered
by
him
for
the
expiation
of
the
sins
of
the
whole
of
mankind
it
will
atone
for
every
mortal
sin
and
we
believe
neither
in
vicarious
atonement
nor
in
the
possibility
of
the
remission
of
the
smallest
sin
by
any
god
not
even
by
a
or
if
such
a
thing
could
have
any
existence
what
we
believe
in
is
strict
and
impartial
justice
our
idea
of
the
unknown
universal
deity
represented
by
karma
is
that
it
is
a
power
which
can
not
fail
and
can
therefore
have
neither
wrath
nor
mercy
only
absolute
equity
which
leaves
every
cause
great
or
small
to
work
out
its
inevitable
effects
the
saying
of
jesus
what
measure
you
mete
it
shall
be
measured
to
you
matth
neither
by
expression
nor
implication
points
to
any
hope
of
future
mercy
or
salvation
by
proxy
this
is
why
recognising
as
we
do
in
our
philosophy
the
justice
of
this
statement
we
can
not
recommend
too
strongly
mercy
charity
and
forgiveness
of
mutual
offences
not
and
good
for
are
buddhist
precepts
and
were
first
preached
in
view
of
the
implacability
of
karmic
law
for
man
to
take
the
law
into
his
own
hands
is
anyhow
a
sacrilegious
presumption
human
law
may
use
restrictive
not
punitive
measures
but
a
man
who
believing
in
karma
still
revenges
himself
and
refuses
to
forgive
every
injury
thereby
rendering
good
for
evil
is
a
criminal
and
only
hurts
himself
as
karma
is
sure
to
punish
the
man
who
wronged
him
by
seeking
to
inflict
an
additional
punishment
on
his
enemy
he
who
instead
of
leaving
that
punishment
to
the
great
law
adds
to
it
his
own
mite
only
begets
thereby
a
cause
for
the
future
reward
of
his
own
enemy
and
a
future
punishment
for
himself
the
unfailing
regulator
affects
in
each
incarnation
the
quality
of
its
successor
and
the
sum
of
the
merit
or
demerit
in
preceding
ones
determines
it
enq
are
we
then
to
infer
a
past
from
his
present
theo
only
so
far
as
to
believe
that
his
present
life
is
what
it
justly
should
be
to
atone
for
the
sins
of
the
past
life
of
and
great
adepts
can
not
as
average
mortals
know
what
those
sins
were
from
our
paucity
of
data
it
is
impossible
for
us
even
to
determine
what
an
old
youth
must
have
been
neither
can
we
for
like
reasons
draw
final
conclusions
merely
from
what
we
see
in
the
life
of
some
man
as
to
what
his
past
life
may
have
been
what
is
karma
enq
but
what
is
karma
theo
as
i
have
said
we
consider
it
as
the
of
the
universe
the
source
origin
and
fount
of
all
other
laws
which
exist
throughout
nature
karma
is
the
unerring
law
which
adjusts
effect
to
cause
on
the
physical
mental
and
spiritual
planes
of
being
as
no
cause
remains
without
its
due
effect
from
greatest
to
least
from
a
cosmic
disturbance
down
to
the
movement
of
your
hand
and
as
like
produces
like
is
that
unseen
and
unknown
law
adjusts
wisely
intelligently
and
each
effect
to
its
cause
tracing
the
latter
back
to
its
producer
though
itself
its
action
is
perceivable
enq
then
it
is
the
the
again
and
is
not
of
much
value
as
an
explanation
of
the
problems
of
life
theo
on
the
contrary
for
though
we
do
not
know
what
karma
is
and
in
its
essence
we
know
it
works
and
we
can
define
and
describe
its
mode
of
action
with
accuracy
we
only
do
know
its
ultimate
just
as
modern
philosophy
universally
admits
that
the
cause
of
anything
is
enq
and
what
has
theosophy
to
say
in
regard
to
the
solution
of
the
more
practical
needs
of
humanity
what
is
the
explanation
which
it
offers
in
reference
to
the
awful
suffering
and
dire
necessity
prevalent
among
the
theo
to
be
pointed
according
to
our
teaching
all
these
great
social
evils
the
distinction
of
classes
in
society
and
of
the
sexes
in
the
affairs
of
life
the
unequal
distribution
of
capital
and
of
are
due
to
what
we
tersely
but
truly
denominate
karma
enq
but
surely
all
these
evils
which
seem
to
fall
upon
the
masses
somewhat
indiscriminately
are
not
actual
merited
and
individual
karma
theo
no
they
can
not
be
so
strictly
defined
in
their
effects
as
to
show
that
each
individual
environment
and
the
particular
conditions
of
life
in
which
each
person
finds
himself
are
nothing
more
than
the
retributive
karma
which
the
individual
generated
in
a
previous
life
we
must
not
lose
sight
of
the
fact
that
every
atom
is
subject
to
the
general
law
governing
the
whole
body
to
which
it
belongs
and
here
we
come
upon
the
wider
track
of
the
karmic
law
do
you
not
perceive
that
the
aggregate
of
individual
karma
becomes
that
of
the
nation
to
which
those
individuals
belong
and
further
that
the
sum
total
of
national
karma
is
that
of
the
world
the
evils
that
you
speak
of
are
not
peculiar
to
the
individual
or
even
to
the
nation
they
are
more
or
less
universal
and
it
is
upon
this
broad
line
of
human
interdependence
that
the
law
of
karma
finds
its
legitimate
and
equable
issue
enq
do
i
then
understand
that
the
law
of
karma
is
not
necessarily
an
individual
law
theo
that
is
just
what
i
mean
it
is
impossible
that
karma
could
readjust
the
balance
of
power
in
the
life
and
progress
unless
it
had
a
broad
and
general
line
of
action
it
is
held
as
a
truth
among
theosophists
that
the
interdependence
of
humanity
is
the
cause
of
what
is
called
distributive
karma
and
it
is
this
law
which
affords
the
solution
to
the
great
question
of
collective
suffering
and
its
relief
it
is
an
occult
law
moreover
that
no
man
can
rise
superior
to
his
individual
failings
without
lifting
be
it
ever
so
little
the
whole
body
of
which
he
is
an
integral
part
in
the
same
way
no
one
can
sin
nor
suffer
the
effects
of
sin
alone
in
reality
there
is
no
such
thing
as
and
the
nearest
approach
to
that
selfish
state
which
the
laws
of
life
permit
is
in
the
intent
or
motive
enq
and
are
there
no
means
by
which
the
distributive
or
national
karma
might
be
concentred
or
collected
so
to
speak
and
brought
to
its
natural
and
legitimate
fulfilment
without
all
this
protracted
suffering
theo
as
a
general
rule
and
within
certain
limits
which
define
the
age
to
which
we
belong
the
law
of
karma
can
not
be
hastened
or
retarded
in
its
fulfilment
but
of
this
i
am
certain
the
point
of
possibility
in
either
of
these
directions
has
never
yet
been
touched
listen
to
the
following
recital
of
one
phase
of
national
suffering
and
then
ask
yourself
whether
admitting
the
working
power
of
individual
relative
and
distributive
karma
these
evils
are
not
capable
of
extensive
modification
and
general
relief
what
i
am
about
to
read
to
you
is
from
the
pen
of
a
national
saviour
one
who
having
overcome
self
and
being
free
to
choose
has
elected
to
serve
humanity
in
bearing
at
least
as
much
as
a
shoulders
can
possibly
bear
of
national
karma
this
is
what
she
says
nature
always
does
speak
you
think
only
sometimes
we
make
so
much
noise
that
we
drown
her
voice
that
is
why
it
is
so
restful
to
go
out
of
the
town
and
nestle
awhile
in
the
arms
i
am
thinking
of
the
evening
on
hampstead
heath
when
we
watched
the
sun
go
down
but
oh
upon
what
suffering
and
misery
that
sun
had
set
a
lady
brought
me
yesterday
a
big
hamper
of
wild
flowers
i
thought
some
of
my
family
had
a
better
right
to
it
than
i
and
so
i
took
it
down
to
a
very
poor
school
in
whitechapel
this
morning
you
should
have
seen
the
pallid
little
faces
brighten
thence
i
went
to
pay
for
some
dinners
at
a
little
cookshop
for
some
children
it
was
in
a
back
street
narrow
full
of
jostling
people
stench
indescribable
from
fish
meat
and
other
comestibles
all
reeking
in
a
sun
that
in
whitechapel
festers
instead
of
purifying
the
cookshop
was
the
quintessence
of
all
the
smells
indescribable
at
loathsome
lumps
of
and
swarms
of
flies
a
very
altar
of
beelzebub
all
about
babies
on
the
prowl
for
scraps
one
with
the
face
of
an
angel
gathering
up
cherrystones
as
a
light
and
nutritious
form
of
diet
i
came
westward
with
every
nerve
shuddering
and
jarred
wondering
whether
anything
can
be
done
with
some
parts
of
london
save
swallowing
them
up
in
an
earthquake
and
starting
their
inhabitants
afresh
after
a
plunge
into
some
purifying
lethe
out
of
which
not
a
memory
might
emerge
and
then
i
thought
of
hampstead
heath
if
by
any
sacrifice
one
could
win
the
power
to
save
these
people
the
cost
would
not
be
worth
counting
but
you
see
they
must
be
how
can
that
be
wrought
in
the
condition
they
now
are
they
would
not
profit
by
any
environment
in
which
they
might
be
placed
and
yet
in
their
present
surroundings
they
must
continue
to
putrefy
it
breaks
my
heart
this
endless
hopeless
misery
and
the
brutish
degradation
that
is
at
once
its
outgrowth
and
its
root
it
is
like
the
banyan
tree
every
branch
roots
itself
and
sends
out
new
shoots
what
a
difference
between
these
feelings
and
the
peaceful
scene
at
hampstead
and
yet
we
who
are
the
brothers
and
sisters
of
these
poor
creatures
have
only
a
right
to
use
hampstead
heaths
to
gain
strength
to
save
by
a
name
too
respected
and
too
well
known
to
be
given
to
enq
that
is
a
sad
but
beautiful
letter
and
i
think
it
presents
with
painful
conspicuity
the
terrible
workings
of
what
you
have
called
and
distributive
but
alas
there
seems
no
immediate
hope
of
any
relief
short
of
an
earthquake
or
some
such
general
ingulfment
theo
what
right
have
we
to
think
so
while
of
humanity
is
in
a
position
to
effect
an
immediate
relief
of
the
privations
which
are
suffered
by
their
fellows
when
every
individual
has
contributed
to
the
general
good
what
he
can
of
money
of
labour
and
of
ennobling
thought
then
and
only
then
will
the
balance
of
national
karma
be
struck
and
until
then
we
have
no
right
nor
any
reasons
for
saying
that
there
is
more
life
on
the
earth
than
nature
can
support
it
is
reserved
for
the
heroic
souls
the
saviours
of
our
race
and
nation
to
find
out
the
cause
of
this
unequal
pressure
of
retributive
karma
and
by
a
supreme
effort
to
readjust
the
balance
of
power
and
save
the
people
from
a
moral
ingulfment
a
thousand
times
more
disastrous
and
more
permanently
evil
than
the
like
physical
catastrophe
in
which
you
seem
to
see
the
only
possible
outlet
for
this
accumulated
misery
enq
well
then
tell
me
generally
how
you
describe
this
law
of
karma
theo
we
describe
karma
as
that
law
of
readjustment
which
ever
tends
to
restore
disturbed
equilibrium
in
the
physical
and
broken
harmony
in
the
moral
world
we
say
that
karma
does
not
act
in
this
or
that
particular
way
always
but
that
it
always
act
so
as
to
restore
harmony
and
preserve
the
balance
of
equilibrium
in
virtue
of
which
the
universe
exists
enq
give
me
an
illustration
theo
later
on
i
will
give
you
a
full
illustration
think
now
of
a
pond
a
stone
falls
into
the
water
and
creates
disturbing
waves
these
waves
oscillate
backwards
and
forwards
till
at
last
owning
to
the
operation
of
what
physicists
call
the
law
of
the
dissipation
of
energy
they
are
brought
to
rest
and
the
water
returns
to
its
condition
of
calm
tranquillity
similarly
action
on
every
plane
produces
disturbance
in
the
balanced
harmony
of
the
universe
and
the
vibrations
so
produced
will
continue
to
roll
backwards
and
forwards
if
its
area
is
limited
till
equilibrium
is
restored
but
since
each
such
disturbance
starts
from
some
particular
point
it
is
clear
that
equilibrium
and
harmony
can
only
be
restored
by
the
reconverging
that
same
of
all
the
forces
which
were
set
in
motion
from
it
and
here
you
have
proof
that
the
consequences
of
a
deeds
thoughts
must
all
react
upon
with
the
same
force
with
which
they
were
set
in
motion
enq
but
i
see
nothing
of
a
moral
character
about
this
law
it
looks
to
me
like
the
simple
physical
law
that
action
and
reaction
are
equal
and
opposite
theo
i
am
not
surprised
to
hear
you
say
that
europeans
have
got
so
much
into
the
ingrained
habit
of
considering
right
and
wrong
good
and
evil
as
matters
of
an
arbitrary
code
of
law
laid
down
either
by
men
or
imposed
upon
them
by
a
personal
god
we
theosophists
however
say
that
and
and
and
are
synonymous
further
we
maintain
that
all
pain
and
suffering
are
results
of
want
of
harmony
and
that
the
one
terrible
and
only
cause
of
the
disturbance
of
harmony
is
selfishness
in
some
form
or
another
hence
karma
gives
back
to
every
man
the
of
his
own
actions
without
any
regard
to
their
moral
character
but
since
he
receives
his
due
for
it
is
obvious
that
he
will
be
made
to
atone
for
all
sufferings
which
he
has
caused
just
as
he
will
reap
in
joy
and
gladness
the
fruits
of
all
the
happiness
and
harmony
he
had
helped
to
produce
i
can
do
no
better
than
quote
for
your
benefit
certain
passages
from
books
and
articles
written
by
our
who
have
a
correct
idea
of
karma
enq
i
wish
you
would
as
your
literature
seems
to
be
very
sparing
on
this
subject
theo
because
it
is
most
difficult
of
all
our
tenets
some
short
time
ago
there
appeared
the
following
objection
from
a
christian
pen
that
the
teaching
in
regard
to
theosophy
is
correct
and
that
must
be
his
own
saviour
must
overcome
self
and
conquer
the
evil
that
is
in
his
dual
nature
to
obtain
the
emancipation
of
his
soul
what
is
man
to
do
after
he
has
been
awakened
and
converted
to
a
certain
extent
from
evil
or
wickedness
how
is
he
to
get
emancipation
or
pardon
or
the
blotting
out
of
the
evil
or
wickedness
he
has
already
done
to
this
connelly
replies
very
pertinently
that
no
one
can
hope
to
the
theosophical
engine
run
on
the
theological
as
he
has
it
possibility
of
shirking
individual
responsibility
is
not
among
the
concepts
of
theosophy
in
this
faith
there
is
no
such
thing
as
pardoning
or
out
of
evil
or
wickedness
already
done
otherwise
than
by
the
adequate
punishment
therefor
of
the
and
the
restoration
of
the
harmony
in
the
universe
that
had
been
disturbed
by
his
wrongful
act
the
evil
has
been
his
own
and
while
others
must
suffer
its
consequences
atonement
can
be
made
by
nobody
but
himself
condition
contemplated
in
which
a
man
shall
have
been
and
converted
to
a
certain
extent
from
evil
or
wickedness
is
that
in
which
a
man
shall
have
realized
that
his
deeds
are
evil
and
deserving
of
punishment
in
that
realization
a
sense
of
personal
responsibility
is
inevitable
and
just
in
proportion
to
the
extent
of
his
awakening
or
must
be
the
sense
of
that
awful
responsibility
while
it
is
strong
upon
him
is
the
time
when
he
is
urged
to
accept
the
doctrine
of
vicarious
atonement
is
told
that
he
must
also
repent
but
nothing
is
easier
than
that
it
is
an
amiable
weakness
of
human
nature
that
we
are
quite
prone
to
regret
the
evil
we
have
done
when
our
attention
is
called
and
we
have
either
suffered
from
it
ourselves
or
enjoyed
its
fruits
possibly
close
analysis
of
the
feeling
would
show
us
that
that
which
we
regret
is
rather
the
necessity
that
seemed
to
require
the
evil
as
a
means
of
attainment
of
our
selfish
ends
than
the
evil
itself
as
this
prospect
of
casting
our
burden
of
sins
the
foot
of
the
may
be
to
the
ordinary
mind
it
does
not
commend
itself
to
the
theosophic
student
he
does
not
apprehend
why
the
sinner
by
attaining
knowledge
of
his
evil
can
thereby
merit
any
pardon
for
or
the
blotting
out
of
his
past
wickedness
or
why
repentance
and
future
right
living
entitle
him
to
a
suspension
in
his
favour
of
the
universal
law
of
relation
between
cause
and
effect
the
results
of
his
evil
deeds
continue
to
exist
the
suffering
caused
to
others
by
his
wickedness
is
not
blotted
out
the
theosophical
student
takes
the
result
of
wickedness
upon
the
innocent
into
his
problem
he
considers
not
only
the
guilty
person
but
his
victims
is
an
infraction
of
the
laws
of
harmony
governing
the
universe
and
the
penalty
thereof
must
fall
upon
the
violator
of
that
law
himself
christ
uttered
the
warning
no
more
lest
a
worse
thing
come
upon
thee
and
paul
said
out
your
own
salvation
whatsoever
a
man
soweth
that
shall
he
also
that
by
the
way
is
a
fine
metaphoric
rendering
of
the
sentence
of
the
puranas
far
antedating
man
reaps
the
consequences
of
his
own
is
the
principle
of
the
law
of
karma
which
is
taught
by
theosophy
sinnett
in
his
buddhism
rendered
karma
as
law
of
ethical
law
of
retribution
as
mdme
blavatsky
translates
its
meaning
is
better
it
is
the
power
which
just
though
mysterious
leads
us
on
unerring
through
ways
unmarked
from
guilt
to
punishment
it
is
more
it
rewards
merit
as
unerringly
and
amply
as
it
punishes
demerit
it
is
the
outcome
of
every
act
of
thought
word
and
deed
and
by
it
men
mould
themselves
their
lives
and
happenings
eastern
philosophy
rejects
the
idea
of
a
newly
created
soul
for
every
baby
born
it
believes
in
a
limited
number
of
monads
evolving
and
growing
more
and
more
perfect
through
their
assimilation
of
many
successive
personalities
those
personalities
are
the
product
of
karma
and
it
is
by
karma
and
that
the
human
monad
in
time
returns
to
its
walker
in
his
offers
the
following
explanation
the
doctrine
of
karma
is
that
we
have
made
ourselves
what
we
are
by
former
actions
and
are
building
our
future
eternity
by
present
actions
there
is
no
destiny
but
what
we
ourselves
determine
there
is
no
salvation
or
condemnation
except
what
we
ourselves
bring
about
because
it
offers
no
shelter
for
culpable
actions
and
necessitates
a
sterling
manliness
it
is
less
welcome
to
weak
natures
than
the
easy
religious
tenets
of
vicarious
atonement
intercession
forgiveness
and
conversions
in
the
domain
of
eternal
justice
the
offence
and
the
punishment
are
inseparably
connected
as
the
same
event
because
there
is
no
real
distinction
between
the
action
and
its
outcome
it
is
karma
or
our
old
acts
that
draws
us
back
into
earthly
life
the
abode
changes
according
to
its
karma
and
this
karma
forbids
any
long
continuance
in
one
condition
because
is
always
changing
so
long
as
action
is
governed
by
material
and
selfish
motives
just
so
long
must
the
effect
of
that
action
be
manifested
in
physical
rebirths
only
the
perfectly
selfless
man
can
elude
the
gravitation
of
material
life
few
have
attained
this
but
it
is
the
goal
of
and
then
the
writer
quotes
from
the
who
believe
in
karma
have
to
believe
in
destiny
which
from
birth
to
death
every
man
is
weaving
thread
by
thread
around
himself
as
a
spider
does
his
cobweb
and
this
destiny
is
guided
either
by
the
heavenly
voice
of
the
invisible
prototype
outside
of
us
or
by
our
more
intimate
astral
or
inner
man
who
is
but
too
often
the
evil
genius
of
the
embodied
entity
called
man
both
these
lead
on
the
outward
man
but
one
of
them
must
prevail
and
from
the
very
beginning
of
the
invisible
affray
the
stern
and
implacable
law
of
compensation
steps
in
and
takes
its
course
faithfully
following
the
fluctuations
when
the
last
strand
is
woven
and
man
is
seemingly
enwrapped
in
the
network
of
his
own
doing
then
he
finds
himself
completely
under
the
empire
of
this
destiny
an
occultist
or
a
philosopher
will
not
speak
of
the
goodness
or
cruelty
of
providence
but
identifying
it
with
he
will
teach
that
nevertheless
it
guards
the
good
and
watches
over
them
in
this
as
in
future
lives
and
that
it
punishes
the
even
to
his
seventh
long
in
short
as
the
effect
of
his
having
thrown
into
perturbation
even
the
smallest
atom
in
the
infinite
world
of
harmony
has
not
been
finally
readjusted
for
the
only
decree
of
eternal
and
immutable
absolute
harmony
in
the
world
of
matter
as
it
is
in
the
world
of
spirit
it
is
not
therefore
karma
that
rewards
or
punishes
but
it
is
we
who
reward
or
punish
ourselves
according
to
whether
we
work
with
through
and
along
with
nature
abiding
by
the
laws
on
which
that
harmony
depends
them
nor
would
the
ways
of
karma
be
inscrutable
were
men
to
work
in
union
and
harmony
instead
of
disunion
and
strife
for
our
ignorance
of
those
one
portion
of
mankind
calls
the
ways
of
providence
dark
and
intricate
while
another
sees
in
them
the
action
of
blind
fatalism
and
a
third
simple
chance
with
neither
gods
nor
devils
to
guide
surely
disappear
if
we
would
but
attribute
all
these
to
their
correct
cause
we
stand
bewildered
before
the
mystery
of
our
own
making
and
the
riddles
of
life
that
we
will
not
solve
and
then
accuse
the
great
sphinx
of
devouring
us
but
verily
there
is
not
an
accident
of
our
lives
not
a
misshapen
day
or
a
misfortune
that
could
not
be
traced
back
to
our
own
doings
in
this
or
in
another
life
the
law
of
karma
is
inextricably
interwoven
with
that
of
it
is
only
this
doctrine
that
can
explain
to
us
the
mysterious
problem
of
good
and
evil
and
reconcile
man
to
the
terrible
and
apparent
injustice
of
life
nothing
but
such
certainty
can
quiet
our
revolted
sense
of
justice
for
when
one
unacquainted
with
the
noble
doctrine
looks
around
him
and
observes
the
inequalities
of
birth
and
fortune
of
intellect
and
capacities
when
one
sees
honour
paid
to
fools
and
profligates
on
whom
fortune
has
heaped
her
favours
by
mere
privilege
of
birth
and
their
nearest
neighbour
with
all
his
intellect
and
noble
more
deserving
in
every
for
want
and
for
lack
of
one
sees
all
this
and
has
to
turn
away
helpless
to
relieve
the
undeserved
suffering
ears
ringing
and
heart
aching
with
the
cries
of
pain
around
blessed
knowledge
of
karma
alone
prevents
him
from
cursing
life
and
men
as
well
as
their
supposed
creator
this
law
whether
conscious
or
unconscious
predestines
nothing
and
no
one
it
exists
from
and
in
eternity
truly
for
it
is
eternity
itself
and
as
such
since
no
act
can
be
coequal
with
eternity
it
can
not
be
said
to
act
for
it
is
action
itself
it
is
not
the
wave
which
drowns
the
man
but
the
personal
action
of
the
wretch
who
goes
deliberately
and
places
himself
under
the
impersonal
action
of
the
laws
that
govern
the
motion
karma
creates
nothing
nor
does
it
design
it
is
man
who
plants
and
creates
causes
and
karmic
law
adjusts
the
effects
which
adjustment
is
not
an
act
but
universal
harmony
tending
ever
to
resume
its
original
position
like
a
bough
which
bent
down
too
forcibly
rebounds
with
corresponding
vigour
if
it
happen
to
dislocate
the
arm
that
tried
to
bend
it
out
of
its
natural
position
shall
we
say
it
is
the
bough
which
broke
our
arm
or
that
our
own
folly
has
brought
us
to
grief
karma
has
never
sought
to
destroy
intellectual
and
individual
liberty
like
the
god
invented
by
the
monotheists
it
has
not
involved
its
decrees
in
darkness
purposely
to
perplex
man
nor
shall
it
punish
him
who
dares
to
scrutinize
its
mysteries
on
the
contrary
he
who
unveils
through
study
and
meditation
its
intricate
paths
and
throws
light
on
those
dark
ways
in
the
windings
of
which
so
many
men
perish
owing
to
their
ignorance
of
the
labyrinth
of
life
is
working
for
the
good
of
his
karma
is
an
absolute
and
eternal
law
in
the
world
of
manifestation
and
as
there
can
only
be
one
absolute
as
one
eternal
cause
believers
in
karma
can
not
be
regarded
as
atheists
or
materialists
still
less
as
fatalists
for
karma
is
one
with
the
unknowable
of
which
it
is
an
aspect
in
its
effects
in
the
phenomenal
another
able
theosophic
writer
says
of
by
sinnett
individual
is
making
karma
either
good
or
bad
in
each
action
and
thought
of
his
daily
round
and
is
at
the
same
time
working
out
in
this
life
the
karma
brought
about
by
the
acts
and
desires
of
the
last
when
we
see
people
afflicted
by
congenital
ailments
it
may
be
safely
assumed
that
these
ailments
are
the
inevitable
results
of
causes
started
by
themselves
in
a
previous
birth
it
may
be
argued
that
as
these
afflictions
are
hereditary
they
can
have
nothing
to
do
with
a
past
incarnation
but
it
must
be
remembered
that
the
ego
the
real
man
the
individuality
has
no
spiritual
origin
in
the
parentage
by
which
it
is
but
it
is
drawn
by
the
affinities
which
its
previous
mode
of
life
attracted
round
it
into
the
current
that
carries
it
when
the
time
comes
for
to
the
home
best
fitted
for
the
development
of
those
tendencies
this
doctrine
of
karma
when
properly
understood
is
well
calculated
to
guide
and
assist
those
who
realize
its
truth
to
a
higher
and
better
mode
of
life
for
it
must
not
be
forgotten
that
not
only
our
actions
but
our
thoughts
also
are
most
assuredly
followed
by
a
crowd
of
circumstances
that
will
influence
for
good
or
for
evil
our
own
future
and
what
is
still
more
important
the
future
of
many
of
our
if
sins
of
omission
and
commission
could
in
any
case
be
only
the
effect
on
the
karma
would
be
a
matter
of
minor
consequence
the
fact
that
every
thought
and
act
through
life
carries
with
it
for
good
or
evil
a
corresponding
influence
on
other
members
of
the
human
family
renders
a
strict
sense
of
justice
morality
and
unselfishness
so
necessary
to
future
happiness
or
progress
a
crime
once
committed
an
evil
thought
sent
out
from
the
mind
are
past
amount
of
repentance
can
wipe
out
their
results
in
the
future
repentance
if
sincere
will
deter
a
man
from
repeating
errors
it
can
not
save
him
or
others
from
the
effects
of
those
already
produced
which
will
most
unerringly
overtake
him
either
in
this
life
or
in
the
next
connelly
believers
in
a
religion
based
upon
such
doctrine
are
willing
it
should
be
compared
with
one
in
which
destiny
for
eternity
is
determined
by
the
accidents
of
a
single
brief
earthly
existence
during
which
he
is
cheered
by
the
promise
that
the
tree
falls
so
shall
it
in
which
his
brightest
hope
when
he
wakes
up
to
a
knowledge
of
his
wickedness
is
the
doctrine
of
vicarious
atonement
and
in
which
even
that
is
handicapped
according
to
the
presbyterian
confession
of
faith
the
decree
of
god
for
the
manifestation
of
his
glory
some
men
and
angels
are
predestinated
unto
everlasting
life
and
others
foreordained
to
everlasting
death
angels
and
men
thus
predestinated
and
foreordained
are
particularly
and
unchangeably
designed
and
their
number
is
so
certain
and
definite
that
it
can
not
be
either
increased
or
diminished
as
god
hath
appointed
the
elect
unto
glory
neither
are
any
other
redeemed
by
christ
effectually
called
justified
adopted
sanctified
and
saved
but
the
elect
only
rest
of
mankind
god
was
pleased
according
to
the
unsearchable
counsel
of
his
own
will
whereby
he
extendeth
or
withholdeth
mercy
as
he
pleaseth
for
the
glory
of
his
sovereign
power
over
his
creatures
to
pass
by
and
to
ordain
them
to
dishonour
and
wrath
for
their
sin
to
the
praise
of
his
glorious
this
is
what
the
able
defender
says
nor
can
we
do
any
better
than
wind
up
the
subject
as
he
does
by
a
quotation
from
a
magnificent
poem
as
he
says
exquisite
beauty
of
edwin
exposition
of
karma
in
light
of
tempts
to
its
reproduction
here
but
it
is
too
long
for
quotation
in
full
here
is
a
portion
of
it
that
total
of
a
soul
which
is
the
things
it
did
the
thoughts
it
had
the
it
wove
with
woof
of
viewless
time
crossed
on
the
warp
invisible
of
acts
before
beginning
and
without
an
end
as
space
eternal
and
as
surety
sure
is
fixed
a
power
divine
which
moves
to
good
only
its
laws
endure
it
will
not
be
contemned
of
anyone
who
thwarts
it
loses
and
who
serves
it
gains
the
hidden
good
it
pays
with
peace
and
bliss
the
hidden
ill
with
pains
it
seeth
everywhere
and
marketh
all
do
recompenseth
do
one
the
equal
retribution
must
be
made
though
dharma
tarry
long
it
knows
not
wrath
nor
pardon
its
measures
mete
its
faultless
balance
weighs
times
are
as
naught
it
will
judge
or
after
many
days
such
is
the
law
which
moves
to
righteousness
which
none
at
last
can
turn
aside
or
stay
the
heart
of
it
is
love
the
end
of
it
is
peace
and
consummation
sweet
obey
and
now
i
advise
you
to
compare
our
theosophic
views
upon
karma
the
law
of
retribution
and
say
whether
they
are
not
both
more
philosophical
and
just
than
this
cruel
and
idiotic
dogma
which
makes
of
a
senseless
fiend
the
tenet
namely
that
the
will
be
saved
and
the
rest
doomed
to
eternal
perdition
enq
yes
i
see
what
you
mean
generally
but
i
wish
you
could
give
some
concrete
example
of
the
action
of
karma
theo
that
i
can
not
do
we
can
only
feel
sure
as
i
said
before
that
our
present
lives
and
circumstances
are
the
direct
results
of
our
own
deeds
and
thoughts
in
lives
that
are
past
but
we
who
are
not
seers
or
initiates
can
not
know
anything
about
the
details
of
the
working
of
the
law
of
karma
enq
can
anyone
even
an
adept
or
seer
follow
out
this
karmic
process
of
readjustment
in
detail
theo
certainly
who
can
do
so
by
the
exercise
of
powers
which
are
latent
even
in
all
men
who
are
those
who
know
enq
does
this
hold
equally
of
ourselves
as
of
others
theo
equally
as
just
said
the
same
limited
vision
exists
for
all
save
those
who
have
reached
in
the
present
incarnation
the
acme
of
spiritual
vision
and
clairvoyance
we
can
only
perceive
that
if
things
with
us
ought
to
have
been
different
they
would
have
been
different
that
we
are
what
we
have
made
ourselves
and
have
only
what
we
have
earned
for
ourselves
enq
i
am
afraid
such
a
conception
would
only
embitter
us
theo
i
believe
it
is
precisely
the
reverse
it
is
disbelief
in
the
just
law
of
retribution
that
is
more
likely
to
awaken
every
combative
feeling
in
man
a
child
as
much
as
a
man
resents
a
punishment
or
even
a
reproof
he
believes
to
be
unmerited
far
more
than
he
does
a
severer
punishment
if
he
feels
that
it
is
merited
belief
in
karma
is
the
highest
reason
for
reconcilement
to
lot
in
this
life
and
the
very
strongest
incentive
towards
effort
to
better
the
succeeding
both
of
these
indeed
would
be
destroyed
if
we
supposed
that
our
lot
was
the
result
of
anything
but
strict
or
that
destiny
was
in
any
other
hands
than
our
own
enq
you
have
just
asserted
that
this
system
of
under
karmic
law
commended
itself
to
reason
justice
and
the
moral
sense
but
if
so
is
it
not
at
some
sacrifice
of
the
gentler
qualities
of
sympathy
and
pity
and
thus
a
hardening
of
the
finer
instincts
of
human
nature
theo
only
apparently
not
really
no
man
can
receive
more
or
less
than
his
deserts
without
a
corresponding
injustice
or
partiality
to
others
and
a
law
which
could
be
averted
through
compassion
would
bring
about
more
misery
than
it
saved
more
irritation
and
curses
than
thanks
remember
also
that
we
do
not
administer
the
law
if
we
do
create
causes
for
its
effects
it
administers
itself
and
again
that
the
most
copious
provision
for
the
manifestation
of
compassion
and
mercy
is
shown
in
the
state
of
devachan
enq
you
speak
of
adepts
as
being
an
exception
to
the
rule
of
our
general
ignorance
do
they
really
know
more
than
we
do
of
and
after
states
theo
they
do
indeed
by
the
training
of
faculties
we
all
possess
but
which
they
alone
have
developed
to
perfection
they
have
entered
in
spirit
these
various
planes
and
states
we
have
been
discussing
for
long
ages
one
generation
of
adepts
after
another
has
studied
the
mysteries
of
being
of
life
death
and
and
all
have
taught
in
their
turn
some
of
the
facts
so
learned
enq
and
is
the
production
of
adepts
the
aim
of
theosophy
theo
theosophy
considers
humanity
as
an
emanation
from
divinity
on
its
return
path
thereto
at
an
advanced
point
upon
the
path
adeptship
is
reached
by
those
who
have
devoted
several
incarnations
to
its
achievement
for
remember
well
no
man
has
ever
reached
adeptship
in
the
secret
sciences
in
one
life
but
many
incarnations
are
necessary
for
it
after
the
formation
of
a
conscious
purpose
and
the
beginning
of
the
needful
training
many
may
be
the
men
and
women
in
the
very
midst
of
our
society
who
have
begun
this
uphill
work
toward
illumination
several
incarnations
ago
and
who
yet
owing
to
the
personal
illusions
of
the
present
life
are
either
ignorant
of
the
fact
or
on
the
road
to
losing
every
chance
in
this
existence
of
progressing
any
farther
they
feel
an
irresistible
attraction
toward
occultism
and
the
and
yet
are
too
personal
and
too
much
in
love
with
the
deceptive
allurements
of
mundane
life
and
the
ephemeral
pleasures
to
give
them
up
and
so
lose
their
chance
in
their
present
birth
but
for
ordinary
men
for
the
practical
duties
of
daily
life
such
a
result
is
inappropriate
as
an
aim
and
quite
ineffective
as
a
motive
enq
what
then
may
be
their
object
or
distinct
purpose
in
joining
the
theosophical
society
theo
many
are
interested
in
our
doctrines
and
feel
instinctively
that
they
are
truer
than
those
of
any
dogmatic
religion
others
have
formed
a
fixed
resolve
to
attain
the
highest
ideal
of
duty
the
difference
between
faith
and
knowledge
or
blind
and
reasoned
faith
enq
you
say
that
they
accept
and
believe
in
the
doctrines
of
theosophy
but
as
they
do
not
belong
to
those
adepts
you
have
just
mentioned
then
they
must
accept
your
teachings
on
in
what
does
this
differ
from
that
of
conventional
religions
theo
as
it
differs
on
almost
all
the
other
points
so
it
differs
on
this
one
what
you
call
and
that
which
is
in
reality
and
with
regard
to
the
dogmas
of
the
christian
religions
becomes
with
us
the
logical
sequence
of
things
about
in
nature
your
doctrines
are
based
upon
interpretation
therefore
upon
the
testimony
of
seers
ours
upon
the
invariable
and
unvarying
testimony
of
seers
the
ordinary
christian
theology
for
instance
holds
that
man
is
a
creature
of
god
of
three
component
soul
and
essential
to
his
integrity
and
all
either
in
the
gross
form
of
physical
earthly
existence
or
in
the
etherealized
form
of
experience
needed
to
so
constitute
him
for
ever
each
man
having
thus
a
permanent
existence
separate
from
other
men
and
from
the
divine
theosophy
on
the
other
hand
holds
that
man
being
an
emanation
from
the
unknown
yet
ever
present
and
infinite
divine
essence
his
body
and
everything
else
is
impermanent
hence
an
illusion
spirit
alone
in
him
being
the
one
enduring
substance
and
even
that
losing
its
separated
individuality
at
the
moment
of
its
complete
reunion
with
the
enq
if
we
lose
even
our
individuality
then
it
becomes
simply
annihilation
theo
i
say
it
since
i
speak
of
not
of
universal
individuality
the
latter
becomes
as
a
part
transformed
into
the
whole
the
is
not
evaporated
but
becomes
the
sea
is
physical
man
when
from
a
fœtus
he
becomes
an
old
man
what
kind
of
satanic
pride
must
be
ours
if
we
place
our
infinitesimally
small
consciousness
and
individuality
higher
than
the
universal
and
infinite
consciousness
enq
it
follows
then
that
there
is
no
man
but
all
is
spirit
theo
you
are
mistaken
it
thus
follows
that
the
union
of
spirit
with
matter
is
but
temporary
or
to
put
it
more
clearly
since
spirit
and
matter
are
one
being
the
two
opposite
poles
of
the
manifested
spirit
loses
its
right
to
the
name
so
long
as
the
smallest
particle
and
atom
of
its
manifesting
substance
still
clings
to
any
form
the
result
of
differentiation
to
believe
otherwise
is
enq
thus
it
is
on
not
on
that
you
assert
that
the
permanent
principle
the
spirit
simply
makes
a
transit
through
matter
theo
i
would
put
it
otherwise
and
assert
that
the
appearance
of
the
permanent
and
one
principle
spirit
is
transient
and
therefore
no
better
than
an
illusion
enq
very
well
and
this
given
out
on
knowledge
not
faith
theo
just
so
but
as
i
see
very
well
what
you
are
driving
at
i
may
just
as
well
tell
you
that
we
hold
such
as
you
advocate
to
be
a
mental
disease
and
real
faith
the
of
the
greeks
as
based
on
whether
supplied
by
the
evidence
of
physical
or
senses
enq
what
do
you
mean
theo
i
mean
if
it
is
the
difference
between
the
two
that
you
want
to
know
then
i
can
tell
you
that
between
on
and
on
spiritual
there
is
a
very
great
difference
enq
what
is
it
theo
one
is
human
credulity
and
the
other
human
belief
and
as
professor
alexander
wilder
says
in
his
to
the
is
ignorance
which
leads
to
profanation
men
ridicule
what
they
do
not
properly
understand
the
undercurrent
of
this
world
is
set
towards
one
goal
and
inside
of
human
credulity
is
a
power
almost
infinite
a
holy
faith
capable
of
apprehending
the
supremest
truths
of
all
those
who
limit
that
to
human
authoritative
dogmas
alone
will
never
fathom
that
power
nor
even
perceive
it
in
their
natures
it
is
stuck
fast
to
the
external
plane
and
is
unable
to
bring
forth
into
play
the
essence
that
rules
it
for
to
do
this
they
have
to
claim
their
right
of
private
judgment
and
this
they
never
to
do
enq
and
is
it
that
which
forces
you
to
reject
god
as
a
personal
father
ruler
and
governor
of
the
universe
theo
precisely
we
believe
in
an
ever
unknowable
principle
because
blind
aberration
alone
can
make
one
maintain
that
the
universe
thinking
man
and
all
the
marvels
contained
even
in
the
world
of
matter
could
have
grown
without
some
to
bring
about
the
extraordinarily
wise
arrangement
of
all
its
parts
nature
may
err
and
often
does
in
its
details
and
the
external
manifestations
of
its
materials
never
in
its
inner
causes
and
results
ancient
pagans
held
on
this
question
far
more
philosophical
views
than
modern
philosophers
whether
agnostics
materialists
or
christians
and
no
pagan
writer
has
ever
yet
advanced
the
proposition
that
cruelty
and
mercy
are
not
finite
feelings
and
can
therefore
be
made
the
attributes
of
an
god
their
gods
therefore
were
all
finite
the
siamese
author
of
the
of
the
expresses
the
same
idea
about
your
personal
god
as
we
do
he
says
buddhist
might
believe
in
the
existence
of
a
god
sublime
above
all
human
qualities
and
perfect
god
above
love
and
hatred
and
jealousy
calmly
resting
in
a
quietude
that
nothing
could
disturb
and
of
such
a
god
he
would
speak
no
disparagement
not
from
a
desire
to
please
him
or
fear
to
offend
him
but
from
natural
veneration
but
he
can
not
understand
a
god
with
the
attributes
and
qualities
of
men
a
god
who
loves
and
hates
and
shows
anger
a
deity
who
whether
described
as
by
christian
missionaries
or
by
mahometans
or
brahmins
or
jews
falls
below
his
standard
of
even
an
ordinary
good
enq
faith
for
faith
is
not
the
faith
of
the
christian
who
believes
in
his
human
helplessness
and
humility
that
there
is
a
merciful
father
in
heaven
who
will
protect
him
from
temptation
help
him
in
life
and
forgive
him
his
transgressions
better
than
the
cold
and
proud
almost
fatalistic
faith
of
the
buddhists
vedantins
and
theosophists
theo
persist
in
calling
our
belief
if
you
will
but
once
we
are
again
on
this
question
i
ask
in
my
turn
faith
for
faith
is
not
the
one
based
on
strict
logic
and
reason
better
than
the
one
which
is
based
simply
on
human
authority
has
all
the
logical
force
of
the
arithmetical
truism
that
and
will
produce
your
faith
is
like
the
logic
of
some
emotional
woman
of
whom
tourgenyeff
said
that
for
them
and
were
generally
and
a
tallow
candle
into
the
bargain
yours
is
a
faith
moreover
which
clashes
not
only
with
every
conceivable
view
of
justice
and
logic
but
which
if
analysed
leads
man
to
his
moral
perdition
checks
the
progress
of
mankind
and
positively
making
of
might
every
second
man
into
a
cain
to
his
brother
abel
enq
what
do
you
allude
to
has
god
the
right
to
forgive
theo
to
the
doctrine
of
atonement
i
allude
to
that
dangerous
dogma
in
which
you
believe
and
which
teaches
us
that
no
matter
how
enormous
our
crimes
against
the
laws
of
god
and
of
man
we
have
but
to
believe
in
the
of
jesus
for
the
salvation
of
mankind
and
his
blood
will
wash
out
every
stain
it
is
twenty
years
that
i
preach
against
it
and
i
may
now
draw
your
attention
to
a
paragraph
from
written
in
this
is
what
christianity
teaches
and
what
we
combat
mercy
is
boundless
and
unfathomable
it
is
impossible
to
conceive
of
a
human
sin
so
damnable
that
the
price
paid
in
advance
for
the
redemption
of
the
sinner
would
not
wipe
it
out
if
a
thousandfold
worse
and
furthermore
it
is
never
too
late
to
repent
though
the
offender
wait
until
the
last
minute
of
the
last
hour
of
the
last
day
of
his
mortal
life
before
his
blanched
lips
utter
the
confession
of
faith
he
may
go
to
paradise
the
dying
thief
did
it
and
so
may
all
others
as
vile
these
are
the
assumptions
of
the
church
and
of
the
clergy
assumptions
banged
at
the
heads
of
your
countrymen
by
favourite
preachers
right
in
the
of
the
xixth
century
this
most
paradoxical
age
of
all
now
to
what
does
it
lead
enq
does
it
not
make
the
christian
happier
than
the
buddhist
or
brahmin
theo
no
not
the
educated
man
at
any
rate
since
the
majority
of
these
have
long
since
virtually
lost
all
belief
in
this
cruel
dogma
but
it
leads
those
who
still
believe
in
it
more
to
the
threshold
of
every
conceivable
than
any
other
i
know
of
let
me
quote
to
you
from
once
more
vol
pp
and
we
step
outside
the
little
circle
of
creed
and
consider
the
universe
as
a
whole
balanced
by
the
exquisite
adjustment
of
parts
how
all
sound
logic
how
the
faintest
glimmering
sense
of
justice
revolts
against
this
vicarious
atonement
if
the
criminal
sinned
only
against
himself
and
wronged
no
one
but
himself
if
by
sincere
repentance
he
could
cause
the
obliteration
of
past
events
not
only
from
the
memory
of
man
but
also
from
that
imperishable
record
which
no
even
the
supremes
of
the
cause
to
disappear
then
this
dogma
might
not
be
incomprehensible
but
to
maintain
that
one
may
wrong
his
kill
disturb
the
equilibrium
of
society
and
the
natural
order
of
things
and
cowardice
hope
or
compulsion
it
matters
forgiven
by
believing
that
the
spilling
of
one
blood
washes
out
the
other
blood
is
preposterous
can
the
of
a
crime
be
obliterated
even
though
the
crime
itself
should
be
pardoned
the
effects
of
a
cause
are
never
limited
to
the
boundaries
of
the
cause
nor
can
the
results
of
crime
be
confined
to
the
offender
and
his
victim
every
good
as
well
as
evil
action
has
its
effects
as
palpably
as
the
stone
flung
into
calm
water
the
simile
is
trite
but
it
is
the
best
ever
conceived
so
let
us
use
it
the
eddying
circles
are
greater
and
swifter
as
the
disturbing
object
is
greater
or
smaller
but
the
smallest
pebble
nay
the
tiniest
speck
makes
its
ripples
and
this
disturbance
is
not
alone
visible
and
on
the
surface
below
unseen
in
every
and
pushes
drop
until
the
sides
and
bottom
are
touched
by
the
force
more
the
air
above
the
water
is
agitated
and
this
disturbance
passes
as
the
physicists
tell
us
from
stratum
to
stratum
out
into
space
forever
and
ever
an
impulse
has
been
given
to
matter
and
that
is
never
lost
can
never
be
recalled
with
crime
and
so
with
its
opposite
the
action
may
be
instantaneous
the
effects
are
eternal
when
after
the
stone
is
once
flung
into
the
pond
we
can
recall
it
to
the
hand
roll
back
the
ripples
obliterate
the
force
expended
restore
the
etheric
waves
to
their
previous
state
of
and
wipe
out
every
trace
of
the
act
of
throwing
the
missile
so
that
record
shall
not
show
that
it
ever
happened
then
we
may
patiently
hear
christians
argue
for
the
efficacy
of
this
atonement
to
believe
in
karmic
law
as
it
now
stands
we
call
upon
the
whole
world
to
decide
which
of
our
two
doctrines
is
the
most
appreciative
of
deific
justice
and
which
is
more
reasonable
even
on
simple
human
evidence
and
logic
enq
yet
millions
believe
in
the
christian
dogma
and
are
happy
theo
pure
sentimentalism
overpowering
their
thinking
faculties
which
no
true
philanthropist
or
altruist
will
ever
accept
it
is
not
even
a
dream
of
selfishness
but
a
nightmare
of
the
human
intellect
look
where
it
leads
to
and
tell
me
the
name
of
that
pagan
country
where
crimes
are
more
easily
committed
or
more
numerous
than
in
christian
lands
look
at
the
long
and
ghastly
annual
records
of
crimes
committed
in
european
countries
and
behold
protestant
and
biblical
america
there
effected
in
prisons
are
more
numerous
than
those
made
by
public
and
preaching
see
how
the
of
christian
justice
stands
murderers
urged
on
by
the
demons
of
lust
revenge
cupidity
fanaticism
or
mere
brutal
thirst
for
blood
who
kill
their
victims
in
most
cases
without
giving
them
time
to
repent
or
call
on
jesus
these
perhaps
died
sinful
and
of
with
theological
the
reward
of
their
greater
or
lesser
offences
but
the
murderer
overtaken
by
human
justice
is
imprisoned
wept
over
by
sentimentalists
prayed
with
and
at
pronounces
the
charmed
words
of
conversion
and
goes
to
the
scaffold
a
redeemed
child
of
jesus
except
for
the
murder
he
would
not
have
been
prayed
with
redeemed
pardoned
clearly
this
man
did
well
to
murder
for
thus
he
gained
eternal
happiness
and
how
about
the
victim
and
his
or
her
family
relatives
dependents
social
relations
has
justice
no
recompense
for
them
must
they
suffer
in
this
world
and
the
next
while
he
who
wronged
them
sits
beside
the
of
calvary
and
is
for
ever
blessed
on
this
question
the
clergy
keep
a
prudent
silence
and
now
you
know
why
fundamental
belief
and
hope
is
justice
for
all
in
heaven
as
on
earth
and
in
this
dogma
enq
the
ultimate
destiny
of
man
then
is
not
a
heaven
presided
over
by
god
but
the
gradual
transformation
of
matter
into
its
primordial
element
spirit
theo
it
is
to
that
final
goal
to
which
all
tends
in
nature
enq
do
not
some
of
you
regard
this
association
or
of
spirit
into
as
evil
and
as
a
sorrow
theo
some
do
and
therefore
strive
to
shorten
their
period
of
probation
on
earth
it
is
not
an
unmixed
evil
however
since
it
ensures
the
experience
upon
which
we
mount
to
knowledge
and
wisdom
i
mean
that
experience
which
that
the
needs
of
our
spiritual
nature
can
never
be
met
by
other
than
spiritual
happiness
as
long
as
we
are
in
the
body
we
are
subjected
to
pain
suffering
and
all
the
disappointing
incidents
occurring
during
life
therefore
and
to
palliate
this
we
finally
acquire
knowledge
which
alone
can
afford
us
relief
and
hope
of
a
better
future
footnotes
sectarian
brahmins
are
here
meant
the
parabrahm
of
the
vedantins
is
the
deity
we
accept
and
believe
in
xii
what
is
practical
theosophy
duty
enq
why
then
the
need
for
rebirths
since
all
alike
fail
to
secure
a
permanent
peace
theo
because
the
final
goal
can
not
be
reached
in
any
way
but
through
life
experiences
and
because
the
bulk
of
these
consist
in
pain
and
suffering
it
is
only
through
the
latter
that
we
can
learn
joys
and
pleasures
teach
us
nothing
they
are
evanescent
and
can
only
bring
in
the
long
run
satiety
moreover
our
constant
failure
to
find
any
permanent
satisfaction
in
life
which
would
meet
the
wants
of
our
higher
nature
shows
us
plainly
that
those
wants
can
be
met
only
on
their
own
plane
spiritual
enq
is
the
natural
result
of
this
a
desire
to
quit
life
by
one
means
or
another
theo
if
you
mean
by
such
desire
then
i
say
most
decidedly
not
such
a
result
can
never
be
a
one
but
is
ever
due
to
a
morbid
brain
disease
or
to
most
decided
and
strong
materialistic
views
it
is
the
worst
of
crimes
and
dire
in
its
results
but
if
by
desire
you
mean
simply
aspiration
to
reach
spiritual
existence
not
a
wish
to
quit
the
earth
then
i
would
call
it
a
very
natural
desire
indeed
otherwise
voluntary
death
would
be
an
abandonment
of
our
present
post
and
of
the
duties
incumbent
on
us
as
well
as
an
attempt
to
shirk
karmic
responsibilities
and
thus
involve
the
creation
of
new
karma
enq
but
if
actions
on
the
material
plane
are
unsatisfying
why
should
duties
which
are
such
actions
be
imperative
theo
first
of
all
because
our
philosophy
teaches
us
that
the
object
of
doing
our
duties
to
all
men
and
to
ourselves
the
last
is
not
the
attainment
of
personal
happiness
but
of
the
happiness
of
others
the
fulfilment
of
right
for
the
sake
of
right
not
for
what
it
may
bring
us
happiness
or
rather
contentment
may
indeed
follow
the
performance
of
duty
but
is
not
and
must
not
be
the
motive
for
it
enq
what
do
you
understand
precisely
by
in
theosophy
it
can
not
be
the
christian
duties
preached
by
jesus
and
his
apostles
since
you
recognize
neither
theo
you
are
once
more
mistaken
what
you
call
were
inculcated
by
every
great
moral
and
religious
reformer
ages
before
the
christian
era
all
that
was
great
generous
heroic
was
in
days
of
old
not
only
talked
about
and
preached
from
pulpits
as
in
our
own
time
but
sometimes
by
whole
nations
the
history
of
the
buddhist
reform
is
full
of
the
most
noble
and
most
heroically
unselfish
acts
ye
all
of
one
mind
having
compassion
one
of
another
love
as
brethren
be
pitiful
be
courteous
not
rendering
evil
for
evil
or
railing
for
railing
but
contrariwise
was
practically
carried
out
by
the
followers
of
buddha
several
centuries
before
peter
the
ethics
of
christianity
are
grand
no
doubt
but
as
undeniably
they
are
not
new
and
have
originated
as
duties
enq
and
how
would
you
define
these
duties
or
in
general
as
you
understand
the
term
theo
duty
is
that
which
is
to
humanity
to
our
neighbours
family
and
especially
that
which
we
owe
to
all
those
who
are
poorer
and
more
helpless
than
we
are
ourselves
this
is
a
debt
which
if
left
unpaid
during
life
leaves
us
spiritually
insolvent
and
moral
bankrupts
in
our
next
incarnation
theosophy
is
the
quintessence
of
enq
so
is
christianity
when
rightly
understood
and
carried
out
theo
no
doubt
it
is
but
then
were
it
not
a
in
practice
theosophy
would
have
little
to
do
amidst
christians
unfortunately
it
is
but
such
those
who
practise
their
duty
towards
all
and
for
own
sake
are
few
and
fewer
still
are
those
who
perform
that
duty
remaining
content
with
the
satisfaction
of
their
own
secret
consciousness
it
the
public
voice
of
praise
that
honours
virtue
and
rewards
it
which
is
ever
uppermost
in
the
minds
of
the
philanthropists
modern
ethics
are
beautiful
to
read
about
and
hear
discussed
but
what
are
words
unless
converted
into
actions
finally
if
you
ask
me
how
we
understand
theosophical
duty
practically
and
in
view
of
karma
i
may
answer
you
that
our
duty
is
to
drink
without
a
murmur
to
the
last
drop
whatever
contents
the
cup
of
life
may
have
in
store
for
us
to
pluck
the
roses
of
life
only
for
the
fragrance
they
may
shed
on
and
to
be
ourselves
content
but
with
the
thorns
if
that
fragrance
can
not
be
enjoyed
without
depriving
some
one
else
of
it
enq
all
this
is
very
vague
what
do
you
do
more
than
christians
do
theo
it
is
not
what
we
members
of
the
theosophical
society
some
of
us
try
our
how
much
farther
theosophy
leads
to
good
than
modern
christianity
does
i
enforced
action
instead
of
mere
intention
and
talk
a
man
may
be
what
he
likes
the
most
worldly
selfish
and
of
men
even
a
rascal
and
it
will
not
prevent
him
from
calling
himself
a
christian
or
others
from
so
regarding
him
but
no
theosophist
has
the
right
to
this
name
unless
he
is
thoroughly
imbued
with
the
correctness
of
truism
end
of
man
is
an
and
not
a
though
it
were
the
unless
he
sets
and
models
his
daily
life
upon
this
truth
the
profession
of
a
truth
is
not
yet
the
enactment
of
it
and
the
more
beautiful
and
grand
it
sounds
the
more
loudly
virtue
or
duty
is
talked
about
instead
of
being
acted
upon
the
more
forcibly
it
will
always
remind
one
of
the
dead
sea
fruit
is
the
most
loathsome
of
all
vices
and
is
the
most
prominent
feature
of
the
greatest
protestant
country
of
this
enq
what
do
you
consider
as
due
to
humanity
at
large
theo
full
recognition
of
equal
rights
and
privileges
for
all
and
without
distinction
of
race
colour
social
position
or
birth
enq
when
would
you
consider
such
due
not
given
theo
when
there
is
the
slightest
invasion
of
that
other
a
man
or
a
nation
when
there
is
any
failure
to
show
him
the
same
justice
kindness
consideration
or
mercy
which
we
desire
for
ourselves
the
whole
present
system
of
politics
is
built
on
the
oblivion
of
such
rights
and
the
most
fierce
assertion
of
national
selfishness
the
french
say
master
like
they
ought
to
add
national
policy
like
enq
do
you
take
any
part
in
politics
theo
as
a
society
we
carefully
avoid
them
for
the
reasons
given
below
to
seek
to
achieve
political
reforms
before
we
have
affected
a
reform
in
nature
is
like
putting
new
wine
into
old
make
men
feel
and
recognise
in
their
innermost
hearts
what
is
their
real
true
duty
to
all
men
and
every
old
abuse
of
power
every
iniquitous
law
in
the
national
policy
based
on
human
social
or
political
selfishness
will
disappear
of
itself
foolish
is
the
gardener
who
seeks
to
weed
his
of
poisonous
plants
by
cutting
them
off
from
the
surface
of
the
soil
instead
of
tearing
them
out
by
the
roots
no
lasting
political
reform
can
be
ever
achieved
with
the
same
selfish
men
at
the
head
of
affairs
as
of
old
the
relations
of
the
to
political
reforms
enq
the
theosophical
society
is
not
then
a
political
organization
theo
certainly
not
it
is
international
in
the
highest
sense
in
that
its
members
comprise
men
and
women
of
all
races
creeds
and
forms
of
thought
who
work
together
for
one
object
the
improvement
of
humanity
but
as
a
society
it
takes
absolutely
no
part
in
any
national
or
party
politics
enq
why
is
this
theo
just
for
the
reasons
i
have
mentioned
moreover
political
action
must
necessarily
vary
with
the
circumstances
of
the
time
and
with
the
idiosyncracies
of
individuals
while
from
the
very
nature
of
their
position
as
theosophists
the
members
of
the
are
agreed
on
the
principles
of
theosophy
or
they
would
not
belong
to
the
society
at
all
it
does
not
thereby
follow
that
they
agree
on
every
other
subject
as
a
society
they
can
only
act
together
in
matters
which
are
common
to
is
in
theosophy
itself
as
individuals
each
is
left
perfectly
free
to
follow
out
his
or
her
particular
line
of
political
thought
and
action
so
long
as
this
does
not
conflict
with
theosophical
principles
or
hurt
the
theosophical
society
enq
but
surely
the
does
not
stand
altogether
aloof
from
the
social
questions
which
are
now
so
fast
coming
to
the
front
theo
the
very
principles
of
the
are
a
proof
that
it
does
rather
that
most
of
its
members
do
stand
aloof
if
humanity
can
only
be
developed
mentally
and
spiritually
by
the
enforcement
first
of
all
of
the
soundest
and
most
scientific
physiological
laws
it
is
the
bounden
duty
of
all
who
strive
for
this
development
to
do
their
utmost
to
see
that
those
laws
shall
be
generally
carried
out
all
theosophists
are
only
too
sadly
aware
that
in
occidental
countries
especially
the
social
condition
of
large
masses
of
the
people
renders
it
impossible
for
either
their
bodies
or
their
spirits
to
be
properly
trained
so
that
the
development
of
both
is
thereby
arrested
as
this
training
and
development
is
one
of
the
express
objects
of
theosophy
the
is
in
thorough
sympathy
and
harmony
with
all
true
efforts
in
this
direction
enq
but
what
do
you
mean
by
each
social
reformer
has
his
own
panacea
and
each
believes
his
to
be
the
one
and
only
thing
which
can
improve
and
save
humanity
theo
perfectly
true
and
this
is
the
real
reason
why
so
little
satisfactory
social
work
is
accomplished
in
most
of
these
panaceas
there
is
no
really
guiding
principle
and
there
is
certainly
no
one
principle
which
connects
them
all
valuable
time
and
energy
are
thus
wasted
for
men
instead
of
strive
one
against
the
other
often
it
is
to
be
feared
for
the
sake
of
fame
and
reward
rather
than
for
the
great
cause
which
they
profess
to
have
at
heart
and
which
should
be
supreme
in
their
lives
enq
how
then
should
theosophical
principles
be
applied
so
that
social
may
be
promoted
and
true
efforts
for
social
amelioration
be
carried
on
theo
let
me
briefly
remind
you
what
these
principles
unity
and
causation
human
solidarity
the
law
of
karma
these
are
the
four
links
of
the
golden
chain
which
should
bind
humanity
into
one
family
one
universal
brotherhood
enq
how
theo
in
the
present
state
of
society
especially
in
civilized
countries
we
are
continually
brought
face
to
face
with
the
fact
that
large
numbers
of
people
are
suffering
from
misery
poverty
and
disease
their
physical
condition
is
wretched
and
their
mental
and
spiritual
faculties
are
often
almost
dormant
on
the
other
hand
many
persons
at
the
opposite
end
of
the
social
scale
are
leading
lives
of
careless
indifference
material
luxury
and
selfish
indulgence
neither
of
these
forms
of
existence
is
mere
chance
both
are
the
effects
of
the
conditions
which
surround
those
who
are
subject
to
them
and
the
neglect
of
social
duty
on
the
one
side
is
most
closely
connected
with
the
stunted
and
arrested
development
on
the
other
in
sociology
as
in
all
branches
of
true
science
the
law
of
universal
causation
holds
good
but
this
causation
necessarily
implies
as
its
logical
outcome
that
human
solidarity
on
which
theosophy
so
strongly
insists
if
the
action
of
one
reacts
on
the
lives
of
all
and
this
is
the
true
scientific
idea
then
it
is
only
by
all
men
becoming
brothers
and
all
women
sisters
and
by
all
practising
in
their
daily
lives
true
brotherhood
and
true
sisterhood
that
the
real
human
solidarity
which
lies
at
the
root
of
the
elevation
of
the
race
can
ever
be
attained
it
is
this
action
and
interaction
this
true
brotherhood
and
sisterhood
in
which
each
shall
live
for
all
and
all
for
each
which
is
one
of
the
fundamental
theosophical
principles
that
every
theosophist
should
be
bound
not
only
to
teach
but
to
carry
out
in
his
or
her
individual
life
enq
all
this
is
very
well
as
a
general
principle
but
how
would
you
apply
it
in
a
concrete
way
theo
look
for
a
moment
at
what
you
would
call
the
concrete
facts
of
human
society
contrast
the
lives
not
only
of
the
masses
of
the
people
but
of
many
of
those
who
are
called
the
middle
and
upper
classes
with
what
they
might
be
under
healthier
and
nobler
conditions
where
justice
kindness
and
love
were
paramount
instead
of
the
selfishness
indifference
and
brutality
which
now
too
often
seem
to
reign
supreme
all
good
and
evil
things
in
humanity
have
their
roots
in
human
character
and
this
character
is
and
has
been
conditioned
by
the
endless
chain
of
cause
and
effect
but
this
conditioning
applies
to
the
future
as
well
as
to
the
present
and
the
past
selfishness
indifference
and
brutality
can
never
be
the
normal
state
of
the
believe
so
would
be
to
despair
of
that
no
theosophist
can
do
progress
can
be
attained
and
only
attained
by
the
development
of
the
nobler
qualities
now
true
evolution
teaches
us
that
by
altering
the
surroundings
of
the
organism
we
can
alter
and
improve
the
organism
and
in
the
strictest
sense
this
is
true
with
regard
to
man
every
theosophist
therefore
is
bound
to
do
his
utmost
to
help
on
by
all
the
means
in
his
power
every
wise
and
social
effort
which
has
for
its
object
the
amelioration
of
the
condition
of
the
poor
such
efforts
should
be
made
with
a
view
to
their
ultimate
social
emancipation
or
the
development
of
the
sense
of
duty
in
those
who
now
so
often
neglect
it
in
nearly
every
relation
of
life
enq
agreed
but
who
is
to
decide
whether
social
efforts
are
wise
or
unwise
theo
no
one
person
and
no
society
can
lay
down
a
rule
in
this
respect
much
must
necessarily
be
left
to
the
individual
judgment
one
general
test
may
however
be
given
will
the
proposed
action
tend
to
promote
that
true
brotherhood
which
it
is
the
aim
of
theosophy
to
bring
about
no
real
theosophist
will
have
much
difficulty
in
applying
such
a
test
once
he
is
satisfied
of
this
his
duty
will
lie
in
the
direction
of
forming
public
opinion
and
this
can
be
attained
only
by
inculcating
those
higher
and
nobler
conceptions
of
public
and
private
duties
which
lie
at
the
root
of
all
spiritual
and
material
improvement
in
every
conceivable
case
he
himself
must
be
a
center
of
spiritual
action
and
from
him
and
his
own
daily
individual
life
must
radiate
those
higher
spiritual
forces
which
alone
can
regenerate
his
enq
but
why
should
he
do
this
are
not
he
and
all
as
you
teach
conditioned
by
their
karma
and
must
not
karma
necessarily
work
itself
out
on
certain
lines
theo
it
is
this
very
law
of
karma
which
gives
strength
to
all
that
i
have
said
the
individual
can
not
separate
himself
from
the
race
nor
the
race
from
the
individual
the
law
of
karma
applies
equally
to
all
although
all
are
not
equally
developed
in
helping
on
the
development
of
others
the
theosophist
believes
that
he
is
not
only
helping
them
to
fulfil
their
karma
but
that
he
is
also
in
the
strictest
sense
fulfilling
his
own
it
is
the
development
of
humanity
of
which
both
he
and
they
are
integral
parts
that
he
has
always
in
view
and
he
knows
that
any
failure
on
his
part
to
respond
to
the
highest
within
him
retards
not
only
himself
but
all
in
their
progressive
march
by
his
actions
he
can
make
it
either
more
difficult
or
more
easy
for
humanity
to
attain
the
next
higher
plane
of
being
enq
how
does
this
bear
on
the
fourth
of
the
principles
you
mentioned
theo
the
connection
is
most
intimate
if
our
present
lives
depend
upon
the
development
of
certain
principles
which
are
a
growth
from
the
germs
left
by
a
previous
existence
the
law
holds
good
as
regards
the
future
once
grasp
the
idea
that
universal
causation
is
not
merely
present
but
past
present
and
future
and
every
action
on
our
present
plane
falls
naturally
and
easily
into
its
true
place
and
is
seen
in
its
true
relation
to
ourselves
and
to
others
every
mean
and
selfish
action
sends
us
backward
and
not
forward
while
every
noble
thought
and
every
unselfish
deed
are
to
the
higher
and
more
glorious
planes
of
being
if
this
life
were
all
then
in
many
respects
it
would
indeed
be
poor
and
mean
but
regarded
as
a
preparation
for
the
next
sphere
of
existence
it
may
be
used
as
the
golden
gate
through
which
we
may
pass
not
selfishly
and
alone
but
in
company
with
our
fellows
to
the
palaces
which
lie
beyond
on
enq
is
equal
justice
to
all
and
love
to
every
creature
the
highest
standard
of
theosophy
theo
no
there
is
an
even
far
higher
one
enq
what
can
it
be
theo
the
giving
to
others
than
to
such
was
the
standard
and
abounding
measure
which
marked
so
the
greatest
teachers
and
masters
of
gautama
buddha
in
history
and
jesus
of
nazareth
as
in
the
gospels
this
trait
alone
was
enough
to
secure
to
them
the
perpetual
reverence
and
gratitude
of
the
generations
of
men
that
come
after
them
we
say
however
that
has
to
be
performed
with
discrimination
and
such
a
if
made
without
justice
or
blindly
regardless
of
subsequent
results
may
often
prove
not
only
made
in
vain
but
harmful
one
of
the
fundamental
rules
of
theosophy
is
justice
to
as
a
unit
of
collective
humanity
not
as
a
personal
not
more
but
not
less
than
to
others
unless
indeed
by
the
sacrifice
of
the
self
we
can
benefit
the
many
enq
could
you
make
your
idea
clearer
by
giving
an
instance
theo
there
are
many
instances
to
illustrate
it
in
history
for
practical
good
to
save
many
or
several
people
theosophy
holds
as
far
higher
than
for
a
sectarian
idea
such
as
that
of
the
heathen
from
for
instance
in
our
opinion
father
damien
the
young
man
of
thirty
who
offered
his
whole
life
in
sacrifice
for
the
benefit
and
alleviation
of
the
sufferings
of
the
lepers
at
molokai
and
who
went
to
live
for
eighteen
years
alone
with
them
to
finally
catch
the
loathsome
disease
and
die
not
died
in
he
has
given
relief
and
relative
happiness
to
thousands
of
miserable
wretches
he
has
brought
to
them
consolation
mental
and
physical
he
threw
a
streak
of
light
into
the
black
and
dreary
night
of
an
existence
the
hopelessness
of
which
is
unparalleled
in
the
records
of
human
suffering
he
was
a
and
his
memory
will
live
for
ever
in
our
annals
in
our
sight
this
poor
belgian
priest
stands
immeasurably
higher
those
sincere
but
fools
the
missionaries
who
have
sacrificed
their
lives
in
the
south
sea
islands
or
china
what
good
have
they
done
they
went
in
one
case
to
those
who
are
not
yet
ripe
for
any
truth
and
in
the
other
to
a
nation
whose
systems
of
religious
philosophy
are
as
grand
as
any
if
only
the
men
who
have
them
would
live
up
to
the
standard
of
confucius
and
their
other
sages
and
they
died
victims
of
irresponsible
cannibals
and
savages
and
of
popular
fanaticism
and
hatred
whereas
by
going
to
the
slums
of
whitechapel
or
some
other
such
locality
of
those
that
stagnate
right
under
the
blazing
sun
of
our
civilization
full
of
christian
savages
and
mental
leprosy
they
might
have
done
real
good
and
preserved
their
lives
for
a
better
and
worthier
cause
enq
but
the
christians
do
not
think
so
theo
of
course
not
because
they
act
on
an
erroneous
belief
they
think
that
by
baptising
the
body
of
an
irresponsible
savage
they
save
his
soul
from
damnation
one
church
forgets
her
martyrs
the
other
beatifies
and
raises
statues
to
such
men
as
labro
who
sacrificed
his
body
for
forty
years
only
to
benefit
the
vermin
which
it
bred
had
we
the
means
to
do
so
we
would
raise
a
statue
to
father
damien
the
true
practical
saint
and
perpetuate
his
memory
for
ever
as
a
living
exemplar
of
theosophical
heroism
and
of
and
mercy
and
enq
then
you
regard
as
a
duty
theo
we
do
and
explain
it
by
showing
that
altruism
is
an
integral
part
of
but
we
have
to
discriminate
a
man
has
no
right
to
starve
himself
that
another
man
may
have
food
unless
the
life
of
that
man
is
obviously
more
useful
to
the
many
than
is
his
own
life
but
it
is
his
duty
to
sacrifice
his
own
comfort
and
to
work
for
others
if
they
are
unable
to
work
for
themselves
it
is
his
duty
to
give
all
that
which
is
wholly
his
own
and
can
benefit
no
one
but
himself
if
he
selfishly
keeps
it
from
others
theosophy
teaches
but
does
not
teach
rash
and
useless
nor
does
it
justify
fanaticism
enq
but
how
are
we
to
reach
such
an
elevated
status
theo
by
the
enlightened
application
of
our
precepts
to
practice
by
the
use
of
our
higher
reason
spiritual
intuition
and
moral
sense
and
by
following
the
dictates
of
what
we
call
still
small
of
our
conscience
which
is
that
of
our
ego
and
which
speaks
louder
in
us
than
the
earthquakes
and
the
thunders
of
jehovah
wherein
lord
is
enq
if
such
are
our
duties
to
humanity
at
large
what
do
you
understand
by
our
duties
to
our
immediate
surroundings
theo
just
the
same
plus
those
that
arise
from
special
obligations
with
regard
to
family
ties
enq
then
it
is
not
true
as
it
is
said
that
no
sooner
does
a
man
enter
into
the
theosophical
society
than
he
begins
to
be
gradually
severed
from
his
wife
children
and
family
duties
theo
it
is
a
groundless
calumny
like
so
many
others
the
first
of
the
theosophical
duties
is
to
do
duty
by
men
and
especially
by
those
to
whom
responsibilities
are
due
because
one
has
either
voluntarily
undertaken
them
such
as
marriage
ties
or
because
destiny
has
allied
one
to
them
i
mean
those
we
owe
to
parents
or
next
of
kin
enq
and
what
may
be
the
duty
of
a
theosophist
to
himself
theo
to
control
and
conquer
the
higher
the
lower
to
purify
himself
inwardly
and
morally
to
fear
no
one
and
nought
save
the
tribunal
of
his
own
conscience
never
to
do
a
thing
by
halves
if
he
thinks
it
the
right
thing
to
do
let
him
do
it
openly
and
boldly
and
if
wrong
never
touch
it
at
all
it
is
the
duty
of
a
theosophist
to
lighten
his
burden
by
thinking
of
the
wise
aphorism
of
epictetus
who
says
not
diverted
from
your
duty
any
idle
reflection
the
silly
world
may
make
upon
for
their
censures
are
not
in
your
power
and
consequently
should
not
be
any
part
of
your
enq
but
suppose
a
member
of
your
society
should
plead
inability
to
practice
altruism
by
other
people
on
the
ground
that
begins
at
urging
that
he
is
too
busy
or
too
poor
to
benefit
mankind
or
even
any
of
its
are
your
rules
in
such
a
case
theo
no
man
has
a
right
to
say
that
he
can
do
nothing
for
others
on
any
pretext
whatever
doing
the
proper
duty
in
the
proper
place
a
man
may
make
the
world
his
debtor
says
an
english
writer
a
cup
of
cold
water
given
in
time
to
a
thirsty
wayfarer
is
a
nobler
duty
and
more
worth
than
a
dozen
of
dinners
given
away
out
of
season
to
men
who
can
afford
to
pay
for
them
no
man
who
has
not
got
it
in
him
will
ever
become
a
but
he
may
remain
a
member
of
our
society
all
the
same
we
have
no
rules
by
which
we
could
force
any
man
to
become
a
practical
theosophist
if
he
does
not
desire
to
be
one
enq
then
why
does
he
enter
the
society
at
all
theo
that
is
best
known
to
him
who
does
so
for
here
again
we
have
no
right
to
a
person
not
even
if
the
voice
of
a
whole
community
should
be
against
him
and
i
may
tell
you
why
in
our
day
so
far
as
regards
the
voice
of
the
educated
at
any
rate
is
no
longer
but
ever
that
of
prejudice
of
selfish
motives
and
often
simply
that
of
unpopularity
our
duty
is
to
sow
seeds
broadcast
for
the
future
and
see
they
are
good
not
to
stop
to
enquire
we
should
do
so
and
how
and
wherefore
we
are
obliged
to
lose
our
time
since
those
who
will
reap
the
harvest
in
days
to
come
will
never
be
ourselves
on
charity
enq
how
do
you
theosophists
regard
the
christian
duty
of
charity
theo
what
charity
do
you
mean
charity
of
mind
or
practical
charity
in
the
physical
plane
enq
i
mean
practical
charity
as
your
idea
of
universal
brotherhood
would
include
of
course
charity
of
mind
theo
then
you
have
in
your
mind
the
practical
carrying
out
of
the
commandments
given
by
jesus
in
the
sermon
on
the
mount
enq
precisely
so
theo
then
why
call
them
because
although
your
saviour
preached
and
practised
them
the
last
thing
the
christians
of
think
of
is
to
carry
them
out
in
their
lives
enq
and
yet
many
are
those
who
pass
their
lives
in
dispensing
charity
theo
yes
out
of
the
surplus
of
their
great
fortunes
but
point
out
to
me
that
christian
among
the
most
philanthropic
who
would
give
to
the
shivering
and
starving
thief
who
would
steal
his
coat
his
cloak
also
or
offer
his
right
cheek
to
him
who
smote
him
on
the
left
and
never
think
of
resenting
it
enq
ah
but
you
must
remember
that
these
precepts
have
not
to
be
taken
literally
times
and
circumstances
have
changed
since
day
moreover
he
spoke
in
parables
theo
then
why
your
churches
teach
that
the
doctrine
of
damnation
and
is
to
be
understood
as
a
too
why
do
some
of
your
most
popular
preachers
while
virtually
allowing
these
to
be
understood
as
you
take
them
insist
on
the
literal
meaning
of
the
fires
of
hell
and
the
tortures
of
an
soul
if
one
is
a
then
the
other
is
if
is
a
literal
truth
then
commandments
in
the
sermon
on
the
mount
have
to
be
obeyed
to
the
very
letter
and
i
tell
you
that
many
who
do
not
believe
in
the
divinity
of
count
leo
tolstoi
and
more
than
one
carry
out
these
noble
because
universal
precepts
literally
and
many
more
good
men
and
women
would
do
so
were
they
not
more
than
certain
that
such
a
walk
in
life
would
very
probably
land
them
in
a
lunatic
are
your
enq
but
surely
every
one
knows
that
millions
and
millions
are
spent
annually
on
private
and
public
charities
theo
oh
yes
half
of
which
sticks
to
the
hands
it
passes
through
before
getting
to
the
needy
while
a
good
portion
or
remainder
gets
into
the
hands
of
professional
beggars
those
who
are
too
lazy
to
work
thus
doing
no
good
whatever
to
those
who
are
really
in
misery
and
suffering
you
heard
that
the
first
result
of
the
great
outflow
of
charity
towards
the
of
london
was
to
raise
the
rents
in
by
some
per
enq
what
would
you
do
then
theo
act
individually
and
not
collectively
follow
the
northern
buddhist
precepts
put
food
into
the
mouth
of
the
hungry
by
the
hand
of
let
the
shadow
of
thy
neighbour
third
come
between
thyself
and
the
object
of
thy
give
to
the
sun
time
to
dry
a
tear
before
thou
hast
wiped
again
give
money
to
the
needy
or
food
to
the
priest
who
begs
at
thy
door
thy
lest
thy
money
should
diminish
gratitude
and
thy
food
turn
to
enq
but
how
can
this
be
applied
practically
theo
the
theosophical
ideas
of
charity
mean
exertion
for
others
mercy
and
kindness
interest
in
the
welfare
of
those
who
suffer
sympathy
forethought
and
assistance
in
their
troubles
or
needs
we
theosophists
do
not
believe
in
giving
money
if
we
had
it
through
other
hands
or
organizations
we
believe
in
giving
to
the
money
a
thousandfold
greater
power
and
effectiveness
by
our
personal
contact
and
sympathy
with
those
who
need
it
we
believe
in
relieving
the
starvation
of
the
soul
as
much
if
not
more
than
the
emptiness
of
the
stomach
for
gratitude
does
more
good
to
the
man
who
feels
it
than
to
him
for
whom
it
is
felt
the
gratitude
which
your
of
should
have
called
forth
or
the
good
feelings
provoked
by
them
is
it
shown
in
the
hatred
of
the
poor
for
the
rich
in
the
growth
of
the
party
of
anarchy
and
disorder
or
by
those
thousands
of
unfortunate
working
girls
victims
to
the
system
driven
daily
to
eke
out
a
living
by
going
on
the
streets
do
your
helpless
old
men
and
women
thank
you
for
the
workhouses
or
your
poor
for
the
poisonously
unhealthy
dwellings
in
which
they
are
allowed
to
breed
new
generations
of
diseased
scrofulous
and
rickety
children
only
to
put
money
into
the
pockets
of
the
insatiable
shylocks
who
own
houses
therefore
it
is
that
every
sovereign
of
all
those
contributed
by
good
and
charitable
people
falls
like
a
burning
curse
instead
of
a
blessing
on
the
poor
whom
it
should
relieve
we
call
this
national
and
terrible
will
be
its
results
on
the
day
of
reckoning
theosophy
for
the
masses
enq
and
you
think
that
theosophy
would
by
stepping
in
help
to
remove
these
evils
under
the
practical
and
adverse
conditions
of
our
modern
life
theo
had
we
more
money
and
had
not
most
of
the
theosophists
to
work
for
their
daily
bread
i
firmly
believe
we
could
enq
how
do
you
expect
that
your
doctrines
could
ever
take
hold
of
the
uneducated
masses
when
they
are
so
abstruse
and
difficult
that
people
can
hardly
understand
them
theo
you
forget
one
thing
which
is
that
your
modern
education
is
precisely
that
which
makes
it
difficult
for
you
to
understand
theosophy
your
mind
is
so
full
of
intellectual
subtleties
and
preconceptions
that
your
natural
intuition
and
perception
of
the
truth
can
not
act
it
does
not
require
metaphysics
or
education
to
make
a
man
understand
the
broad
truths
of
karma
and
look
at
the
millions
of
poor
and
uneducated
buddhists
and
hindoos
to
whom
karma
and
are
solid
realities
simply
because
their
minds
have
never
been
cramped
and
distorted
by
being
forced
into
an
unnatural
groove
they
have
never
had
the
innate
human
sense
of
justice
perverted
in
them
by
being
told
to
believe
that
their
sins
would
be
forgiven
because
another
man
had
been
put
to
death
for
their
sakes
and
the
buddhists
note
well
live
up
to
their
beliefs
without
a
murmur
against
karma
or
what
they
regard
as
a
just
punishment
whereas
the
christian
populace
neither
lives
up
it
to
its
moral
ideal
nor
accepts
its
lot
contentedly
hence
murmuring
and
dissatisfaction
and
the
intensity
of
the
struggle
for
existence
in
western
lands
enq
but
this
contentedness
which
you
praise
so
much
would
do
away
with
all
motive
for
exertion
and
bring
progress
to
a
theo
and
we
theosophists
say
that
your
vaunted
progress
and
civilization
are
no
better
than
a
host
of
flickering
over
a
marsh
which
exhales
a
poisonous
and
deadly
miasma
this
because
we
see
selfishness
crime
immorality
and
all
the
evils
imaginable
pouncing
upon
unfortunate
mankind
from
this
box
which
you
call
an
age
of
progress
and
increasing
with
the
growth
of
your
material
civilization
at
such
a
price
better
the
inertia
and
inactivity
of
buddhist
countries
which
have
arisen
only
as
a
consequence
of
ages
of
political
slavery
enq
then
is
all
this
metaphysics
and
mysticism
with
which
you
occupy
yourself
so
much
of
no
importance
theo
to
the
masses
who
need
only
practical
guidance
and
support
they
are
not
of
much
consequence
but
for
the
educated
the
natural
leaders
of
the
masses
those
whose
modes
of
thought
and
action
will
sooner
or
later
be
adopted
by
those
masses
they
are
of
the
greatest
importance
it
is
only
by
means
of
the
philosophy
that
an
intelligent
and
educated
man
can
avoid
the
intellectual
suicide
of
believing
on
blind
faith
and
it
is
only
by
assimilating
the
strict
continuity
and
logical
coherence
of
the
eastern
if
not
esoteric
doctrines
that
he
can
realize
their
truth
conviction
breeds
enthusiasm
and
says
bulwer
lytton
the
genius
of
sincerity
and
truth
accomplishes
no
victories
without
while
emerson
most
truly
remarks
that
great
and
commanding
movement
in
the
annals
of
the
world
is
the
triumph
of
and
what
is
more
calculated
to
produce
such
a
feeling
than
a
philosophy
so
grand
so
consistent
so
logical
and
so
as
our
eastern
doctrines
enq
and
yet
its
enemies
are
very
numerous
and
every
day
theosophy
acquires
new
opponents
theo
and
this
is
precisely
that
which
proves
its
intrinsic
excellence
and
value
people
hate
only
the
things
they
fear
and
no
one
goes
out
of
his
way
to
overthrow
that
which
neither
threatens
nor
rises
beyond
mediocrity
enq
do
you
hope
to
impart
this
enthusiasm
one
day
to
the
masses
theo
why
not
since
history
tells
us
that
the
masses
adopted
buddhism
with
enthusiasm
while
as
said
before
the
practical
effect
upon
them
of
this
philosophy
of
ethics
is
still
shown
by
the
smallness
of
the
percentage
of
crime
amongst
buddhist
populations
as
compared
with
every
other
religion
the
chief
point
is
to
uproot
that
most
fertile
source
of
all
crime
and
belief
that
it
is
possible
for
them
to
escape
the
consequences
of
their
own
actions
once
teach
them
that
greatest
of
all
laws
and
and
besides
feeling
in
themselves
the
true
dignity
of
human
nature
they
will
turn
from
evil
and
eschew
it
as
they
would
a
physical
danger
how
members
can
help
the
society
enq
how
do
you
expect
the
fellows
of
your
society
to
help
in
the
work
theo
first
by
studying
and
comprehending
the
theosophical
doctrines
so
that
they
may
teach
others
especially
the
young
people
secondly
by
taking
every
opportunity
of
talking
to
others
and
explaining
to
them
what
theosophy
is
and
what
it
is
not
by
removing
misconceptions
and
spreading
an
interest
in
the
subject
thirdly
by
assisting
in
circulating
our
literature
by
buying
books
when
they
have
the
means
by
lending
and
giving
them
and
by
inducing
their
friends
to
do
so
fourthly
by
defending
the
society
from
the
unjust
aspersions
cast
upon
it
by
every
legitimate
device
in
their
power
fifth
and
most
important
of
all
by
the
example
of
their
own
lives
enq
but
all
this
literature
to
the
spread
of
which
you
attach
so
much
importance
does
not
seem
to
me
of
much
practical
use
in
helping
mankind
this
is
not
practical
charity
theo
we
think
otherwise
we
hold
that
a
good
book
which
gives
people
food
for
thought
which
strengthens
and
clears
their
minds
and
enables
them
to
grasp
truths
which
they
have
dimly
felt
but
could
not
hold
that
such
a
book
does
a
real
substantial
good
as
to
what
you
call
practical
deeds
of
charity
to
benefit
the
bodies
of
our
we
do
what
little
we
can
but
as
i
have
already
told
you
most
of
us
are
poor
whilst
the
society
itself
has
not
even
the
money
to
pay
a
staff
of
workers
all
of
us
who
toil
for
it
give
our
labour
gratis
and
in
most
cases
money
as
well
the
few
who
have
the
means
of
doing
what
are
usually
called
charitable
actions
follow
the
buddhist
precepts
and
do
their
work
themselves
not
by
proxy
or
by
subscribing
publicly
to
charitable
funds
what
the
theosophist
has
to
do
above
all
is
to
forget
his
personality
what
a
theosophist
ought
not
to
do
enq
have
you
any
prohibitory
laws
or
clauses
for
theosophists
in
your
society
theo
many
but
alas
none
of
them
are
enforced
they
express
the
ideal
of
our
organization
the
practical
application
of
such
things
we
are
compelled
to
leave
to
the
discretion
of
the
fellows
themselves
unfortunately
the
state
of
minds
in
the
present
century
is
such
that
unless
we
allow
these
clauses
to
remain
so
to
speak
obsolete
no
man
or
woman
would
dare
to
risk
joining
the
theosophical
society
this
is
precisely
why
i
feel
forced
to
lay
such
a
stress
on
the
difference
between
true
theosophy
and
its
and
but
still
unworthy
vehicle
the
theosophical
society
enq
may
i
be
told
what
are
these
perilous
reefs
in
the
open
sea
of
theosophy
theo
well
may
you
call
them
reefs
as
more
than
one
otherwise
sincere
and
has
had
his
theosophical
canoe
shattered
into
splinters
on
them
and
yet
to
avoid
certain
things
seems
the
easiest
thing
in
the
world
to
do
for
instance
here
is
a
series
of
such
negatives
screening
positive
theosophical
duties
no
theosophist
should
be
silent
when
he
hears
evil
reports
or
slanders
spread
about
the
society
or
innocent
persons
whether
they
be
his
colleagues
or
outsiders
enq
but
suppose
what
one
hears
is
the
truth
or
may
be
true
without
one
knowing
it
theo
then
you
must
demand
good
proofs
of
the
assertion
and
hear
both
sides
impartially
before
you
permit
the
accusation
to
go
uncontradicted
you
have
no
right
to
believe
in
evil
until
you
get
undeniable
proof
of
the
correctness
of
the
statement
enq
and
what
should
you
do
then
theo
pity
and
forbearance
charity
and
ought
to
be
always
there
to
prompt
us
to
excuse
our
sinning
brethren
and
to
pass
the
gentlest
sentence
possible
upon
those
who
err
a
theosophist
ought
never
to
forget
what
is
due
to
the
shortcomings
and
infirmities
of
human
nature
enq
ought
he
to
forgive
entirely
in
such
cases
theo
in
every
case
especially
he
who
is
sinned
against
enq
but
if
by
so
doing
he
risks
to
injure
or
allow
others
to
be
injured
what
ought
he
to
do
then
theo
his
duty
that
which
his
conscience
and
higher
nature
suggests
to
him
but
only
after
mature
deliberation
justice
consists
in
doing
no
injury
to
any
living
being
but
justice
commands
us
also
never
to
allow
injury
to
be
done
to
the
many
or
even
to
one
innocent
person
by
allowing
the
guilty
one
to
go
unchecked
enq
what
are
the
other
negative
clauses
theo
no
theosophist
ought
to
be
contented
with
an
idle
or
frivolous
life
doing
no
real
good
to
himself
and
still
less
to
others
he
should
work
for
the
benefit
of
the
few
who
need
his
help
if
he
is
unable
to
toil
for
humanity
and
thus
work
for
the
advancement
of
the
theosophical
cause
enq
this
demands
an
exceptional
nature
and
would
come
rather
hard
upon
some
persons
theo
then
they
had
better
remain
outside
the
instead
of
sailing
under
false
colours
no
one
is
asked
to
give
more
than
he
can
afford
whether
in
devotion
time
work
or
money
enq
what
comes
next
theo
no
working
member
should
set
too
great
value
on
his
personal
progress
or
proficiency
in
theosophic
studies
but
must
be
prepared
rather
to
do
as
much
altruistic
work
as
lies
in
his
power
he
should
not
leave
the
whole
of
the
heavy
burden
and
responsibility
of
the
theosophical
movement
on
the
shoulders
of
the
few
devoted
workers
each
member
ought
to
feel
it
his
duty
to
take
what
share
he
can
in
the
common
work
and
help
it
by
every
means
in
his
power
enq
this
is
but
just
what
comes
next
theo
no
theosophist
should
place
his
personal
vanity
or
feelings
above
those
of
his
society
as
a
body
he
who
sacrifices
the
latter
or
other
reputations
on
the
altar
of
his
personal
vanity
worldly
benefit
or
pride
ought
not
to
be
allowed
to
remain
a
member
one
cancerous
limb
diseases
the
whole
body
enq
is
it
the
duty
of
every
member
to
teach
others
and
preach
theosophy
theo
it
is
indeed
no
fellow
has
a
right
to
remain
idle
on
the
excuse
that
he
knows
too
little
to
teach
for
he
may
always
be
sure
that
he
will
find
others
who
know
still
less
than
himself
and
also
it
is
not
until
a
man
begins
to
try
to
teach
others
that
he
discovers
his
own
ignorance
and
tries
to
remove
it
but
this
is
a
minor
clause
enq
what
do
you
consider
then
to
be
the
chief
of
these
negative
theosophical
duties
theo
to
be
ever
prepared
to
recognize
and
confess
faults
to
rather
sin
through
exaggerated
praise
than
through
too
little
appreciation
of
efforts
never
to
or
slander
another
person
always
to
say
openly
and
direct
to
his
face
anything
you
have
against
him
never
to
make
yourself
the
echo
of
anything
you
may
hear
against
another
nor
harbour
revenge
against
those
who
happen
to
injure
you
enq
but
it
is
often
dangerous
to
tell
people
the
truth
to
their
faces
you
think
so
i
know
of
one
of
your
members
who
was
bitterly
offended
left
the
society
and
became
its
greatest
enemy
only
because
he
was
told
some
unpleasant
truths
to
his
face
and
was
blamed
for
them
theo
of
such
we
have
had
many
no
member
whether
prominent
or
insignificant
has
ever
left
us
without
becoming
our
bitter
enemy
enq
how
do
you
account
for
it
theo
it
is
simply
this
having
been
in
most
cases
intensely
devoted
to
the
society
at
first
and
having
lavished
upon
it
the
most
exaggerated
praises
the
only
possible
excuse
such
a
backslider
can
make
for
his
subsequent
behaviour
and
past
is
pose
as
an
innocent
and
deceived
thus
casting
the
blame
from
his
own
shoulders
on
to
those
of
the
society
in
general
and
its
leaders
especially
such
persons
remind
one
of
the
old
fable
about
the
man
with
a
distorted
face
who
broke
his
on
the
ground
that
it
reflected
his
countenance
crookedly
enq
but
what
makes
these
people
turn
against
the
society
theo
wounded
vanity
in
some
form
or
other
almost
in
every
case
generally
because
their
dicta
and
advice
are
not
taken
as
final
and
authoritative
or
else
because
they
are
of
those
who
would
rather
reign
in
hell
than
serve
in
heaven
because
in
short
they
can
not
bear
to
stand
second
to
anybody
in
anything
so
for
instance
one
true
and
almost
defamed
every
member
in
the
to
outsiders
as
much
as
to
theosophists
under
the
pretext
that
they
were
blaming
them
precisely
for
what
he
was
himself
doing
all
the
time
finally
he
left
the
society
giving
as
his
reason
a
profound
conviction
that
we
were
all
the
founders
especially
another
one
after
intriguing
in
every
possible
way
to
be
placed
at
the
head
of
a
large
section
of
the
society
finding
that
the
members
would
not
have
him
turned
against
the
founders
of
the
and
became
their
bitterest
enemy
denouncing
one
of
them
whenever
he
could
simply
because
the
latter
could
not
and
would
not
upon
the
members
this
was
simply
a
case
of
an
outrageous
wounded
vanity
still
another
wanted
to
and
virtually
did
practise
undue
personal
psychological
influence
on
certain
fellows
while
pretending
devotion
and
every
theosophical
virtue
when
this
was
put
a
stop
to
the
member
broke
with
theosophy
and
now
slanders
and
lies
against
the
same
hapless
leaders
in
the
most
virulent
manner
endeavouring
to
break
up
the
society
by
blackening
the
reputation
of
those
whom
that
worthy
was
unable
to
deceive
enq
what
would
you
do
with
such
characters
theo
leave
them
to
their
karma
because
one
person
does
evil
that
is
no
reason
for
others
to
do
so
enq
but
to
return
to
slander
where
is
the
line
of
demarcation
between
backbiting
and
just
criticism
to
be
drawn
is
it
not
duty
to
warn
friends
and
neighbors
against
those
whom
one
knows
to
be
dangerous
associates
theo
if
by
allowing
them
to
go
on
unchecked
other
persons
may
be
thereby
injured
it
is
certainly
our
duty
to
obviate
the
danger
by
warning
them
privately
but
true
or
false
no
accusation
against
another
person
should
ever
be
spread
abroad
if
true
and
the
fault
hurts
no
one
but
the
sinner
then
leave
him
to
his
karma
if
false
then
you
will
have
avoided
adding
to
the
injustice
of
the
world
therefore
keep
silent
about
such
things
with
every
one
not
directly
concerned
but
if
your
discretion
and
silence
are
likely
to
hurt
or
endanger
others
then
i
add
the
truth
at
all
and
say
with
annesly
duty
not
there
are
cases
when
one
is
forced
to
exclaim
discretion
rather
than
allow
it
to
interfere
with
enq
methinks
if
you
carry
out
these
maxims
you
are
likely
to
reap
a
nice
crop
of
troubles
theo
and
so
we
do
we
have
to
admit
that
we
are
now
open
to
the
same
taunt
as
the
early
christians
were
how
these
theosophists
love
one
another
may
now
be
said
of
us
without
a
shadow
of
injustice
enq
admitting
yourself
that
there
is
at
least
as
much
if
not
more
backbiting
slandering
and
quarrelling
in
the
as
in
the
christian
churches
let
alone
scientific
kind
of
brotherhood
is
this
i
may
ask
theo
a
very
poor
specimen
indeed
as
at
present
and
until
carefully
sifted
and
reorganized
better
than
all
others
remember
however
that
human
nature
is
the
same
the
theosophical
society
as
of
it
its
members
are
no
saints
they
are
at
best
sinners
trying
to
do
better
and
liable
to
fall
back
owing
to
personal
weakness
add
to
this
that
our
is
no
or
established
body
and
stands
so
to
speak
outside
of
the
pale
of
jurisdiction
besides
which
it
is
in
a
chaotic
condition
and
as
unjustly
as
is
no
other
what
wonder
then
that
those
members
who
fail
to
carry
out
its
ideal
should
turn
after
leaving
the
society
for
sympathetic
protection
to
our
enemies
and
pour
all
their
gall
and
bitterness
into
their
too
willing
ears
knowing
that
they
will
find
support
sympathy
and
ready
credence
for
every
accusation
however
absurd
that
it
may
please
them
to
launch
against
the
theosophical
society
they
hasten
to
do
so
and
vent
their
wrath
on
the
innocent
which
reflected
too
faithfully
their
faces
never
forgive
those
whom
they
have
the
sense
of
kindness
received
and
repaid
by
them
with
ingratitude
drives
them
into
a
madness
of
before
the
world
and
their
own
consciences
the
former
is
but
too
ready
to
believe
in
anything
said
against
a
society
it
hates
the
i
will
say
no
more
fearing
i
have
already
said
too
much
enq
your
position
does
not
seem
to
me
a
very
enviable
one
theo
it
is
not
but
you
think
that
there
must
be
something
very
noble
very
exalted
very
true
behind
the
society
and
its
philosophy
when
the
leaders
and
the
founders
of
the
movement
still
continue
to
work
for
it
with
all
their
strength
they
sacrifice
to
it
all
comfort
all
worldly
prosperity
and
success
even
to
their
good
name
and
even
to
their
receive
in
return
incessant
and
ceaseless
obloquy
relentless
persecution
untiring
slander
constant
ingratitude
and
misunderstanding
of
their
best
efforts
blows
and
buffets
from
all
by
simply
dropping
their
work
they
would
find
themselves
immediately
released
from
every
responsibility
shielded
from
every
further
attack
enq
i
confess
such
a
perseverance
seems
to
me
very
astounding
and
i
wondered
why
you
did
all
this
theo
believe
me
for
no
only
in
the
hope
of
training
a
few
individuals
to
carry
on
our
work
for
humanity
by
its
original
programme
when
the
founders
are
dead
and
gone
they
have
already
found
a
few
such
noble
and
devoted
souls
to
replace
them
the
coming
generations
thanks
to
these
few
will
find
the
path
to
peace
a
little
less
thorny
and
the
way
a
little
widened
and
thus
all
this
suffering
will
have
produced
good
results
and
their
will
not
have
been
in
vain
at
present
the
main
fundamental
object
of
the
society
is
to
sow
germs
in
the
hearts
of
men
which
may
in
time
sprout
and
under
more
propitious
circumstances
lead
to
a
healthy
reform
conducive
of
more
happiness
the
than
they
have
hitherto
enjoyed
xiii
on
the
misconceptions
about
the
theosophical
society
theosophy
and
asceticism
enq
i
have
heard
people
say
that
your
rules
require
all
members
to
be
vegetarians
celibates
and
rigid
ascetics
but
you
have
not
told
me
anything
of
the
sort
yet
can
you
tell
the
truth
once
for
all
about
this
theo
the
truth
is
that
our
rules
require
nothing
of
the
kind
the
theosophical
society
does
not
even
expect
far
less
require
of
of
its
members
that
they
should
be
ascetics
in
any
way
you
call
they
should
try
and
benefit
other
people
and
be
unselfish
in
their
own
lives
enq
but
still
many
of
your
members
are
strict
vegetarians
and
openly
avow
their
intention
of
remaining
unmarried
this
too
is
most
often
the
case
with
those
who
take
a
prominent
part
in
connection
with
the
work
of
your
society
theo
that
is
only
natural
because
most
of
our
really
earnest
workers
are
members
of
the
inner
section
of
the
society
which
i
told
you
about
before
enq
oh
then
you
do
require
ascetic
practices
in
that
inner
section
theo
no
we
do
not
or
them
even
there
but
i
see
that
i
had
better
give
you
an
explanation
of
our
views
on
the
subject
of
asceticism
in
general
and
then
you
will
understand
about
vegetarianism
and
so
on
enq
please
proceed
theo
as
i
have
already
told
you
most
people
who
become
really
earnest
students
of
theosophy
and
active
workers
in
our
society
wish
to
do
more
than
study
theoretically
the
truths
we
teach
they
wish
to
the
truth
by
their
own
direct
personal
experience
and
to
study
occultism
with
the
object
of
acquiring
the
wisdom
and
power
which
they
feel
that
they
need
in
order
to
help
others
effectually
and
judiciously
instead
of
blindly
and
at
haphazard
therefore
sooner
or
later
they
join
the
inner
section
enq
but
you
said
that
are
not
obligatory
even
in
that
inner
section
theo
no
more
they
are
but
the
first
thing
which
the
members
learn
there
is
a
true
conception
of
the
relation
of
the
body
or
physical
sheath
to
the
inner
the
true
man
the
relation
and
mutual
interaction
between
these
two
aspects
of
human
nature
are
explained
and
demonstrated
to
them
so
that
they
soon
become
imbued
with
the
supreme
importance
of
the
inner
man
over
the
outer
case
or
body
they
are
taught
that
blind
unintelligent
asceticism
is
mere
folly
that
such
conduct
as
that
of
labro
which
i
spoke
of
before
or
that
of
the
indian
fakirs
and
jungle
ascetics
who
cut
burn
and
macerate
their
bodies
in
the
most
cruel
and
horrible
manner
is
simply
for
selfish
ends
to
develop
but
is
perfectly
useless
for
the
purpose
of
assisting
true
spiritual
or
theosophic
development
enq
i
see
you
regard
only
asceticism
as
necessary
it
is
as
a
means
to
an
end
that
end
being
the
perfect
equilibrium
of
the
nature
of
man
and
the
attainment
of
complete
mastery
over
the
body
with
all
its
passions
and
desires
theo
just
so
but
these
means
must
be
used
intelligently
and
wisely
not
blindly
and
foolishly
like
an
athlete
who
is
training
and
preparing
for
a
great
contest
not
like
the
miser
who
starves
himself
into
illness
that
he
may
gratify
his
passion
for
gold
enq
i
understand
now
your
general
idea
but
let
us
see
how
you
apply
it
in
practice
how
about
vegetarianism
for
instance
theo
one
of
the
great
german
scientists
has
shown
that
every
kind
of
animal
tissue
however
you
may
cook
it
still
retains
certain
marked
characteristics
of
the
animal
which
it
belonged
to
which
characteristics
can
be
recognised
and
apart
from
that
every
one
knows
by
the
taste
what
meat
he
is
eating
we
go
a
step
farther
and
prove
that
when
the
flesh
of
animals
is
assimilated
by
man
as
food
it
imparts
to
him
physiologically
some
of
the
characteristics
of
the
animal
it
came
from
moreover
occult
science
teaches
and
proves
this
to
its
students
by
ocular
demonstration
showing
also
that
this
or
effect
on
man
is
greatest
from
the
flesh
of
the
larger
animals
less
for
birds
still
less
for
fish
and
other
animals
and
least
of
all
when
he
eats
only
vegetables
enq
then
he
had
better
not
eat
at
all
theo
if
he
could
live
without
eating
of
course
it
would
but
as
the
matter
stands
he
must
eat
to
live
and
so
we
advise
really
earnest
students
to
eat
such
food
as
will
least
clog
and
weight
their
brains
and
bodies
and
will
have
the
smallest
effect
in
hampering
and
retarding
the
development
of
their
intuition
their
inner
faculties
and
powers
enq
then
you
do
not
adopt
all
the
arguments
which
vegetarians
in
general
are
in
the
habit
of
using
theo
certainly
not
some
of
their
arguments
are
very
weak
and
often
based
on
assumptions
which
are
quite
false
but
on
the
other
hand
many
of
the
things
they
say
are
quite
true
for
instance
we
believe
that
much
disease
and
especially
the
great
predisposition
to
disease
which
is
becoming
so
marked
a
feature
in
our
time
is
very
largely
due
to
the
eating
of
meat
and
especially
of
tinned
meats
but
it
would
take
too
long
to
go
thoroughly
into
this
question
of
vegetarianism
on
its
merits
so
please
pass
on
to
something
else
enq
one
question
more
what
are
your
members
of
the
inner
section
to
do
with
regard
to
their
food
when
they
are
ill
theo
follow
the
best
practical
advice
they
can
get
of
course
you
grasp
yet
that
we
never
impose
any
obligations
in
this
respect
remember
once
for
all
that
in
all
such
questions
we
take
a
rational
and
never
a
fanatical
view
of
things
if
from
illness
or
long
habit
a
man
can
not
go
without
meat
why
by
all
means
let
him
eat
it
it
is
no
crime
it
will
only
retard
his
progress
a
little
for
after
all
is
said
and
done
the
purely
bodily
actions
and
functions
are
of
far
less
importance
than
what
a
man
and
what
desires
he
encourages
in
his
mind
and
allows
to
take
root
and
grow
there
enq
then
with
regard
to
the
use
of
wine
and
spirits
i
suppose
you
do
not
advise
people
to
drink
them
theo
they
are
worse
for
his
moral
and
spiritual
growth
than
meat
for
alcohol
in
all
its
forms
has
a
direct
marked
and
very
deleterious
influence
on
psychic
condition
wine
and
spirit
drinking
is
only
less
destructive
to
the
development
of
the
inner
powers
than
the
habitual
use
of
hashish
opium
and
similar
drugs
theosophy
and
marriage
enq
now
to
another
question
must
a
man
marry
or
remain
a
celibate
theo
it
depends
on
the
kind
of
man
you
mean
if
you
refer
to
one
who
intends
to
live
the
world
one
who
even
though
a
good
earnest
theosophist
and
an
ardent
worker
for
our
cause
still
has
ties
and
wishes
which
bind
him
to
the
world
who
in
short
does
not
feel
that
he
has
done
for
ever
with
what
men
call
life
and
that
he
desires
one
thing
and
one
thing
know
the
truth
and
to
be
able
to
help
for
such
a
one
i
say
there
is
no
reason
why
he
should
not
marry
if
he
likes
to
take
the
risks
of
that
lottery
where
there
are
so
many
more
blanks
than
prizes
surely
you
can
not
believe
us
so
absurd
and
fanatical
as
to
preach
against
marriage
altogether
on
the
contrary
save
in
a
few
exceptional
cases
of
practical
occultism
marriage
is
the
only
remedy
against
immorality
enq
but
why
can
not
one
acquire
this
knowledge
and
power
when
living
a
married
life
theo
my
dear
sir
i
can
not
go
into
physiological
questions
with
you
but
i
can
give
you
an
obvious
and
i
think
a
sufficient
answer
which
will
explain
to
you
the
moral
reasons
we
give
for
it
can
a
man
serve
two
masters
no
then
it
is
equally
impossible
for
him
to
divide
his
attention
between
the
pursuit
of
occultism
and
a
wife
if
he
tries
to
he
will
assuredly
fail
in
doing
either
properly
and
let
me
remind
you
practical
occultism
is
far
too
serious
and
dangerous
a
study
for
a
man
to
take
up
unless
he
is
in
the
most
deadly
earnest
and
ready
to
sacrifice
himself
first
of
to
gain
his
end
but
this
does
not
apply
to
the
members
of
our
inner
section
i
am
only
referring
to
those
who
are
determined
to
tread
that
path
of
discipleship
which
leads
to
the
highest
goal
most
if
not
all
of
those
who
join
our
inner
section
are
only
beginners
preparing
themselves
in
this
life
to
enter
in
reality
upon
that
path
in
lives
to
come
theosophy
and
education
enq
one
of
your
strongest
arguments
for
the
inadequacy
of
the
existing
forms
of
religion
in
the
west
as
also
to
some
extent
the
materialistic
philosophy
which
is
now
so
popular
but
which
you
seem
to
consider
as
an
abomination
of
desolation
is
the
large
amount
of
misery
and
wretchedness
which
undeniably
exists
especially
in
our
great
cities
but
surely
you
must
recognize
how
much
has
been
and
is
being
done
to
remedy
this
state
of
things
by
the
spread
of
education
and
the
diffusion
of
intelligence
theo
the
future
generations
will
hardly
thank
you
for
such
a
of
intelligence
nor
will
your
present
education
do
much
good
to
the
poor
starving
masses
enq
ah
but
you
must
give
us
time
it
is
only
a
few
years
since
we
began
to
educate
the
people
theo
and
what
pray
has
your
christian
religion
been
doing
ever
since
the
fifteenth
century
once
you
acknowledge
that
the
education
of
the
masses
has
not
been
attempted
till
very
work
if
ever
there
could
be
one
which
a
a
church
and
people
ought
to
perform
enq
well
you
may
be
right
but
theo
just
let
us
consider
this
question
of
education
from
a
broad
standpoint
and
i
will
prove
to
you
that
you
are
doing
harm
not
good
with
many
of
your
boasted
improvements
the
schools
for
the
poorer
children
though
far
less
useful
than
they
ought
to
be
are
good
in
contrast
with
the
vile
surroundings
to
which
they
are
doomed
by
your
modern
society
the
of
a
little
practical
theosophy
would
help
a
hundred
times
more
in
life
the
poor
suffering
masses
than
all
this
infusion
of
useless
intelligence
enq
but
theo
let
me
finish
please
you
have
opened
a
subject
on
which
we
theosophists
feel
deeply
and
i
must
have
my
say
i
quite
agree
that
there
is
a
great
advantage
to
a
small
child
bred
in
the
slums
having
the
gutter
for
playground
and
living
amid
continued
coarseness
of
gesture
and
word
in
being
placed
daily
in
a
bright
clean
hung
with
pictures
and
often
gay
with
flowers
there
it
is
taught
to
be
clean
gentle
orderly
there
it
learns
to
sing
and
to
play
has
toys
that
awaken
its
intelligence
learns
to
use
its
fingers
deftly
is
spoken
to
with
a
smile
instead
of
a
frown
is
gently
rebuked
or
coaxed
instead
of
cursed
all
this
humanises
the
children
arouses
their
brains
and
renders
them
susceptible
to
intellectual
and
moral
influences
the
schools
are
not
all
they
might
be
and
ought
to
be
but
compared
with
the
homes
they
are
paradises
and
they
slowly
are
reacting
on
the
homes
but
while
this
is
true
of
many
of
the
board
schools
your
system
deserves
the
worst
one
can
say
of
it
enq
so
be
it
go
on
theo
what
is
the
object
of
modern
education
is
it
to
cultivate
and
develop
the
mind
in
the
right
direction
to
teach
the
disinherited
and
hapless
people
to
carry
with
fortitude
the
burden
of
life
allotted
them
by
karma
to
strengthen
their
will
to
inculcate
in
them
the
love
of
neighbour
and
the
feeling
of
mutual
interdependence
and
brotherhood
and
thus
to
train
and
form
the
character
for
practical
life
not
a
bit
of
it
and
yet
these
are
undeniably
the
objects
of
all
true
education
no
one
denies
it
all
your
educationalists
admit
it
and
talk
very
big
indeed
on
the
subject
but
what
is
the
practical
result
of
their
action
every
young
man
and
boy
nay
every
one
of
the
younger
generation
of
schoolmasters
will
answer
object
of
modern
education
is
to
pass
examinations
a
system
not
to
develop
right
emulation
but
to
generate
and
breed
jealousy
envy
hatred
almost
in
young
people
for
one
another
and
thus
train
them
for
a
life
of
ferocious
selfishness
and
struggle
for
honours
and
emoluments
instead
of
kindly
feeling
enq
i
must
admit
you
are
right
there
theo
and
what
are
these
terror
of
modern
boyhood
and
youth
they
are
simply
a
method
of
classification
by
which
the
results
of
your
school
teaching
are
tabulated
in
other
words
they
form
the
practical
application
of
the
modern
science
methods
to
the
homo
intellection
now
teaches
that
intellect
is
a
result
of
the
mechanical
interaction
of
the
therefore
it
is
only
logical
that
modern
education
should
be
almost
entirely
sort
of
automatic
machine
for
the
fabrication
of
intellect
by
the
ton
very
little
experience
of
examinations
is
enough
to
show
that
the
education
they
produce
is
simply
a
training
of
the
physical
memory
and
sooner
or
later
all
your
schools
will
sink
to
this
level
as
to
any
real
sound
cultivation
of
the
thinking
and
reasoning
power
it
is
simply
impossible
while
everything
has
to
be
judged
by
the
results
as
tested
by
competitive
examinations
again
school
training
is
of
the
very
greatest
importance
in
forming
character
especially
in
its
moral
bearing
now
from
first
to
last
your
modern
system
is
based
on
the
scientific
revelations
struggle
for
and
the
of
the
all
through
his
early
life
every
man
has
these
driven
into
him
by
practical
example
and
experience
as
well
as
by
direct
teaching
till
it
is
impossible
to
eradicate
from
his
mind
the
idea
that
the
lower
personal
animal
self
is
the
and
of
life
here
you
get
the
great
source
of
all
the
crime
and
heartless
selfishness
which
you
admit
as
much
as
i
do
selfishness
as
said
over
and
over
again
is
the
curse
of
humanity
and
the
prolific
parent
of
all
the
evils
and
crimes
in
this
life
and
it
is
your
schools
which
are
the
hotbeds
of
such
selfishness
enq
that
is
all
very
fine
as
generalities
but
i
should
like
a
few
facts
and
to
learn
also
how
this
can
be
remedied
theo
very
well
i
will
try
and
satisfy
you
there
are
three
great
divisions
of
scholastic
establishments
board
and
public
schools
running
up
the
scale
from
the
most
grossly
commercial
to
the
idealistic
classical
with
many
permutations
and
combinations
the
practical
commercial
begets
the
modern
side
and
the
ancient
and
orthodox
classical
reflects
its
heavy
respectability
even
as
far
as
the
school
board
pupil
establishments
here
we
plainly
see
the
scientific
and
material
commercial
supplanting
the
effete
orthodox
and
classical
neither
is
the
reason
very
far
to
seek
the
objects
of
this
branch
of
education
are
then
pounds
shillings
and
pence
the
of
the
xixth
century
thus
the
energies
generated
by
the
brain
molecules
of
its
adherents
are
all
concentrated
on
one
point
and
are
therefore
to
some
extent
an
organized
army
of
and
speculative
intellects
of
the
minority
of
men
trained
against
the
hosts
of
the
ignorant
masses
doomed
to
be
vampirised
lived
and
sat
upon
by
their
intellectually
stronger
brethren
such
training
is
not
only
it
is
simply
unchristian
result
the
direct
outcome
of
this
branch
of
education
is
an
overflooding
of
the
market
with
machines
with
heartless
selfish
have
been
most
carefully
trained
to
prey
on
their
fellows
and
take
advantage
of
the
ignorance
of
their
weaker
brethren
enq
well
but
you
can
not
assert
that
of
our
great
public
schools
at
any
rate
theo
not
exactly
it
is
true
but
though
the
is
different
the
animating
spirit
is
the
same
and
whether
eton
and
harrow
turn
out
scientists
or
divines
and
theologians
enq
surely
you
mean
to
call
eton
and
harrow
theo
no
of
course
the
classical
system
is
above
all
things
and
in
the
present
day
is
productive
of
some
good
it
does
still
remain
the
favourite
at
our
great
public
schools
where
not
only
an
intellectual
but
also
a
social
education
is
obtainable
it
is
therefore
of
prime
importance
that
the
dull
boys
of
aristocratic
and
wealthy
parents
should
go
to
such
schools
to
meet
the
rest
of
the
young
life
of
the
and
money
classes
but
unfortunately
there
is
a
huge
competition
even
for
entrance
for
the
moneyed
classes
are
increasing
and
poor
but
clever
boys
seek
to
enter
the
public
schools
by
the
rich
scholarships
both
at
the
schools
themselves
and
from
them
to
the
universities
enq
according
to
this
view
the
wealthier
have
to
work
even
harder
than
their
poorer
fellows
theo
it
is
so
but
strange
to
say
the
faithful
of
the
cult
of
the
of
the
do
not
practice
their
creed
for
their
whole
exertion
is
to
make
the
naturally
unfit
supplant
the
fit
thus
by
bribes
of
large
sums
of
money
they
allure
the
best
teachers
from
their
natural
pupils
to
mechanicalise
their
naturally
unfit
progeny
into
professions
which
they
uselessly
overcrowd
enq
and
you
attribute
all
this
to
what
theo
all
this
is
owing
to
the
perniciousness
of
a
system
which
turns
out
goods
to
order
irrespective
of
the
natural
proclivities
and
talents
of
the
youth
the
poor
little
candidate
for
this
progressive
paradise
of
learning
comes
almost
straight
from
the
nursery
to
the
treadmill
of
a
preparatory
school
for
sons
of
gentlemen
here
he
is
immediately
seized
upon
by
the
workmen
of
the
factory
and
crammed
with
latin
french
and
greek
accidence
dates
and
tables
so
that
if
he
have
any
natural
genius
it
is
rapidly
squeezed
out
of
him
by
the
rollers
of
what
carlyle
has
so
enq
but
surely
he
is
taught
something
besides
vocables
and
much
of
that
which
may
lead
him
direct
to
if
not
entirely
into
the
theosophical
society
theo
not
much
for
of
history
he
will
attain
only
sufficient
knowledge
of
his
own
particular
nation
to
fit
him
with
a
steel
armour
of
prejudice
against
all
other
peoples
and
be
steeped
in
the
foul
of
chronicled
national
hate
and
and
surely
you
would
not
call
enq
what
are
your
further
objections
theo
added
to
this
is
a
smattering
of
selected
biblical
facts
from
the
study
of
which
all
intellect
is
eliminated
it
is
simply
a
memory
lesson
the
of
the
teacher
being
a
of
circumstances
and
not
of
reason
enq
yes
but
i
have
heard
you
congratulate
yourself
at
the
number
of
the
agnostics
and
atheists
in
our
day
so
that
it
appears
that
even
people
trained
in
the
system
you
abuse
so
heartily
learn
to
think
and
reason
for
themselves
theo
yes
but
it
is
rather
owing
to
a
healthy
reaction
from
that
system
than
due
to
it
we
prefer
immeasurably
more
in
our
society
agnostics
and
even
rank
atheists
to
bigots
of
whatever
religion
an
mind
is
ever
opened
to
the
truth
whereas
the
latter
blinds
the
bigot
like
the
sun
does
an
owl
the
the
most
philanthropic
and
our
fellows
were
and
are
agnostics
and
atheists
disbelievers
in
a
god
but
there
are
no
boys
and
girls
and
generally
early
training
will
leave
its
mark
behind
in
the
shape
of
a
cramped
and
distorted
mind
a
proper
and
sane
system
of
education
should
produce
the
most
vigorous
and
liberal
mind
strictly
trained
in
logical
and
accurate
thought
and
not
in
blind
faith
how
can
you
ever
expect
good
results
while
you
pervert
the
reasoning
faculty
of
your
children
by
bidding
them
believe
in
the
miracles
of
the
bible
on
sunday
while
for
the
six
other
days
of
the
week
you
teach
them
that
such
things
are
scientifically
impossible
enq
what
would
you
have
then
theo
if
we
had
money
we
would
found
schools
which
would
turn
out
something
else
than
reading
and
writing
candidates
for
starvation
children
should
above
all
be
taught
love
for
all
men
altruism
mutual
charity
and
more
than
anything
else
to
think
and
reason
for
themselves
we
would
reduce
the
purely
mechanical
work
of
the
memory
to
an
absolute
minimum
and
devote
the
time
to
the
development
and
training
of
the
inner
senses
faculties
and
latent
capacities
we
would
endeavour
to
deal
with
each
child
as
a
unit
and
to
educate
it
so
as
to
produce
the
most
harmonious
and
equal
unfoldment
of
its
powers
in
order
that
its
special
aptitudes
should
find
their
full
natural
development
we
should
aim
at
creating
men
and
women
free
intellectually
free
morally
unprejudiced
in
all
respects
and
above
all
things
and
we
believe
that
much
if
not
all
of
this
could
be
obtained
by
and
truly
education
why
then
is
there
so
much
prejudice
against
the
enq
if
theosophy
is
even
half
of
what
you
say
why
should
there
exist
such
a
terrible
against
it
this
is
even
more
of
a
problem
than
anything
else
theo
it
is
but
you
must
bear
in
mind
how
many
powerful
adversaries
we
have
aroused
ever
since
the
formation
of
our
society
as
i
just
said
if
the
theosophical
movement
were
one
of
those
numerous
modern
crazes
as
harmless
at
the
end
as
they
are
evanescent
it
would
be
simply
laughed
it
is
now
by
those
who
still
do
not
understand
its
real
left
severely
alone
but
it
is
nothing
of
the
kind
intrinsically
theosophy
is
the
most
serious
movement
of
this
age
and
one
moreover
which
threatens
the
very
life
of
most
of
the
humbugs
prejudices
and
social
evils
of
the
evils
which
fatten
and
make
happy
the
upper
ten
and
their
imitators
and
sycophants
the
wealthy
dozens
of
the
middle
classes
while
they
positively
crush
and
starve
out
of
existence
the
millions
of
the
poor
think
of
this
and
you
will
easily
understand
the
reason
of
such
a
relentless
persecution
by
those
others
who
more
observant
and
perspicacious
do
see
the
true
nature
of
theosophy
and
therefore
dread
it
enq
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
that
it
is
because
a
few
have
understood
what
theosophy
leads
to
that
they
try
to
crush
the
movement
but
if
theosophy
leads
only
to
good
surely
you
can
not
be
prepared
to
utter
such
a
terrible
accusation
of
perfidious
heartlessness
and
treachery
even
against
those
few
theo
i
am
so
prepared
on
the
contrary
i
do
not
call
the
enemies
we
have
had
to
battle
with
during
the
first
nine
or
ten
years
of
the
existence
either
powerful
or
but
only
those
who
have
arisen
against
us
in
the
last
three
or
four
years
and
these
neither
speak
write
nor
preach
against
theosophy
but
work
in
silence
and
behind
the
backs
of
the
foolish
puppets
who
act
as
their
visible
yet
if
to
most
of
the
members
of
our
society
they
are
well
known
to
the
true
and
the
protectors
of
our
society
but
they
must
remain
for
certain
reasons
unnamed
at
present
enq
and
are
they
known
to
many
of
you
or
to
yourself
alone
theo
i
never
said
knew
them
i
may
or
may
not
know
i
know
and
this
is
sufficient
and
defy
them
to
do
their
they
may
achieve
great
mischief
and
throw
confusion
into
our
ranks
especially
among
the
and
those
who
can
judge
only
by
appearances
will
not
crush
the
do
what
they
may
apart
from
these
truly
dangerous
however
only
to
those
theosophists
who
are
unworthy
of
the
name
and
whose
place
is
rather
than
the
number
of
our
opponents
is
more
than
considerable
enq
can
you
name
these
at
least
if
you
will
not
speak
of
the
others
theo
of
course
i
can
we
have
to
contend
against
the
hatred
of
the
spiritualists
american
english
and
french
the
constant
opposition
of
the
clergy
of
all
denominations
especially
the
relentless
hatred
and
persecution
of
the
missionaries
in
india
this
led
to
the
famous
and
infamous
attack
on
our
theosophical
society
by
the
society
for
psychical
research
an
attack
which
was
stirred
up
by
a
regular
conspiracy
organized
by
the
missionaries
in
india
lastly
we
must
count
the
defection
of
various
prominent
members
for
reasons
i
have
already
explained
all
of
whom
have
contributed
their
utmost
to
increase
the
prejudice
against
us
enq
can
not
you
give
me
more
details
about
these
so
that
i
may
know
what
to
answer
when
brief
history
of
the
society
in
short
and
why
the
world
believes
all
this
theo
the
reason
is
simple
most
outsiders
knew
absolutely
nothing
of
the
society
itself
its
motives
objects
or
beliefs
from
its
very
beginning
the
world
has
seen
in
theosophy
nothing
but
certain
marvellous
phenomena
in
which
of
the
do
not
believe
very
soon
the
society
came
to
be
regarded
as
a
body
pretending
to
the
possession
of
powers
the
world
never
realised
that
the
society
taught
absolute
disbelief
in
or
even
the
possibility
of
such
that
in
the
society
there
were
only
a
few
people
who
possessed
such
psychic
powers
and
but
few
who
cared
for
them
nor
did
it
understand
that
the
phenomena
were
never
produced
publicly
but
only
privately
for
friends
and
merely
given
as
an
accessory
to
prove
by
direct
demonstration
that
such
things
could
be
produced
without
dark
rooms
spirits
mediums
or
any
of
the
usual
paraphernalia
unfortunately
this
misconception
was
greatly
strengthened
and
exaggerated
by
the
first
book
on
the
subject
which
excited
much
attention
in
if
this
work
did
much
to
bring
the
society
into
prominence
it
attracted
still
more
obloquy
derision
and
misrepresentation
upon
the
hapless
heroes
and
heroine
thereof
of
this
the
author
was
more
than
warned
in
the
but
did
not
pay
attention
to
the
such
it
was
though
enq
for
what
and
since
when
do
the
spiritualists
hate
you
theo
from
the
first
day
of
the
existence
no
sooner
the
fact
became
known
that
as
a
body
the
did
not
believe
in
communications
with
the
spirits
of
the
dead
but
regarded
the
as
for
the
most
part
astral
reflections
of
disembodied
personalities
shells
than
the
spiritualists
conceived
a
violent
hatred
to
us
and
especially
to
the
founders
this
hatred
found
expression
in
every
kind
of
slander
uncharitable
personal
remarks
and
absurd
misrepresentations
of
the
theosophical
teachings
in
all
the
american
spiritualistic
organs
for
years
we
were
persecuted
denounced
and
abused
this
began
in
and
continues
to
the
present
day
in
the
headquarters
of
the
were
transferred
from
new
york
to
bombay
india
and
then
permanently
to
madras
when
the
first
branch
of
our
society
the
british
was
founded
in
london
the
english
spiritualists
came
out
in
arms
against
us
as
the
americans
had
done
and
the
french
spiritists
followed
suit
enq
but
why
should
the
clergy
be
hostile
to
you
when
after
all
the
main
tendency
of
the
theosophical
doctrines
is
opposed
to
materialism
the
great
enemy
of
all
forms
of
religion
in
our
day
theo
the
clergy
opposed
us
on
the
general
principle
that
who
is
not
with
me
is
against
since
theosophy
does
not
agree
with
any
one
sect
or
creed
it
is
considered
the
enemy
of
all
alike
because
it
teaches
that
they
are
all
more
or
less
mistaken
the
missionaries
in
india
hated
and
tried
to
crush
us
because
they
saw
the
flower
of
the
educated
indian
youth
and
the
brahmins
who
are
almost
inaccessible
to
them
joining
the
society
in
large
numbers
and
yet
apart
from
this
general
class
hatred
the
counts
in
its
ranks
many
clergymen
and
even
one
or
two
bishops
enq
and
what
led
the
to
take
the
field
against
you
you
were
both
pursuing
the
same
line
of
study
in
some
respects
and
several
of
the
psychic
researchers
belonged
to
your
society
theo
first
of
all
we
were
very
good
friends
with
the
leaders
of
the
but
when
the
attack
on
the
phenomena
appeared
in
the
college
supported
by
the
pretended
revelations
of
a
menial
the
found
that
they
had
compromised
themselves
by
publishing
in
their
too
many
of
the
phenomena
which
had
occurred
in
connection
with
the
their
ambition
is
to
pose
as
an
and
body
so
that
they
had
to
choose
between
retaining
that
position
by
throwing
overboard
the
and
even
trying
to
destroy
it
and
seeing
themselves
merged
in
the
opinion
of
the
sadducees
of
the
with
the
theosophists
and
spiritualists
there
was
no
way
for
them
out
of
it
no
two
choices
and
they
chose
to
throw
us
overboard
it
was
a
matter
of
dire
necessity
for
them
but
so
hard
pressed
were
they
to
find
any
apparently
reasonable
motive
for
the
life
of
devotion
and
ceaseless
labour
led
by
the
two
founders
and
for
the
complete
absence
of
any
pecuniary
profit
or
other
advantage
to
them
that
our
enemies
were
obliged
to
resort
to
the
eminently
ridiculous
and
now
famous
spy
theory
to
explain
this
devotion
but
the
old
saying
blood
of
the
martyr
is
the
seed
of
the
church
proved
once
more
correct
after
the
first
shock
of
this
attack
the
doubled
and
tripled
its
numbers
but
the
bad
impression
produced
still
remains
a
french
author
was
right
in
saying
calomniez
toujours
et
encore
il
en
restera
toujours
quelque
therefore
it
is
that
unjust
prejudices
are
current
and
that
everything
connected
with
the
and
especially
with
its
founders
is
so
falsely
distorted
because
based
on
malicious
hearsay
alone
enq
yet
in
the
years
during
which
the
society
has
existed
you
must
have
had
ample
time
and
opportunity
to
show
yourselves
and
your
work
in
their
true
light
theo
how
or
when
have
we
been
given
such
an
opportunity
our
most
prominent
members
had
an
aversion
to
anything
that
looked
like
publicly
justifying
themselves
their
policy
has
ever
been
must
live
it
and
does
it
matter
what
the
newspapers
say
or
people
think
the
society
was
too
poor
to
send
out
public
lecturers
and
therefore
the
expositions
of
our
views
and
doctrines
were
confined
to
a
few
theosophical
works
that
met
with
success
but
which
people
often
misunderstood
or
only
knew
of
through
hearsay
our
journals
were
and
still
are
boycotted
our
literary
works
ignored
and
to
this
day
no
one
seems
even
to
feel
quite
certain
whether
the
theosophists
are
a
kind
of
worshippers
or
simply
that
may
mean
it
was
useless
for
us
to
go
on
denying
day
after
day
and
year
after
year
every
kind
of
inconceivable
stories
about
us
for
no
sooner
was
one
disposed
of
than
another
a
still
more
absurd
and
malicious
one
was
born
out
of
the
ashes
of
the
first
unfortunately
human
nature
is
so
constituted
that
any
good
said
of
a
person
is
immediately
forgotten
and
never
repeated
but
one
has
only
to
utter
a
calumny
or
to
start
a
matter
how
absurd
false
or
incredible
it
may
be
if
only
it
is
connected
with
some
unpopular
it
to
be
successful
and
forthwith
accepted
as
a
historical
fact
like
the
rumour
springs
up
at
first
as
a
soft
gentle
breeze
hardly
stirring
the
grass
under
your
feet
and
arising
no
one
knows
whence
then
in
the
shortest
space
of
time
it
is
transformed
into
a
strong
wind
begins
to
blow
a
gale
and
forthwith
becomes
a
roaring
storm
a
calumny
among
news
is
what
an
octopus
is
among
fishes
it
sucks
into
mind
fastens
upon
our
memory
which
feeds
upon
it
leaving
indelible
marks
even
after
the
calumny
has
been
bodily
destroyed
a
calumnious
lie
is
the
only
that
will
open
any
and
every
brain
it
is
sure
to
receive
welcome
and
hospitality
in
every
human
mind
the
highest
as
the
lowest
if
only
a
little
prejudiced
and
no
matter
from
however
base
a
quarter
and
motive
it
has
started
enq
you
think
your
assertion
altogether
too
sweeping
the
englishman
has
never
been
to
believe
in
anything
said
and
our
nation
is
proverbially
known
for
its
love
of
fair
play
a
lie
has
no
legs
to
stand
upon
for
long
theo
the
englishman
is
as
ready
to
believe
evil
as
a
man
of
any
other
nation
for
it
is
human
nature
and
not
a
national
feature
as
to
lies
if
they
have
no
legs
to
stand
upon
according
to
the
proverb
they
have
exceedingly
rapid
wings
and
they
can
and
do
fly
farther
and
wider
than
any
other
kind
of
news
in
england
as
elsewhere
remember
lies
and
calumny
are
the
only
kind
of
literature
we
can
always
get
gratis
and
without
paying
any
subscription
we
can
make
the
experiment
if
you
like
will
you
who
are
so
interested
in
theosophical
matters
and
have
heard
so
much
about
us
will
you
put
me
questions
on
as
many
of
these
rumours
and
as
you
can
think
of
i
will
answer
you
the
truth
and
nothing
but
the
truth
subject
to
the
strictest
verification
enq
before
we
change
the
subject
let
us
have
the
whole
truth
on
this
one
now
some
writers
have
called
your
teachings
and
others
on
the
ground
that
many
and
orientalists
find
in
the
indian
religions
nothing
but
in
its
many
forms
accuse
you
of
teaching
nothing
better
than
phallic
worship
they
say
that
since
modern
theosophy
is
so
closely
allied
with
eastern
and
particularly
indian
thought
it
can
not
be
free
from
this
taint
occasionally
even
they
go
so
far
as
to
accuse
european
theosophists
of
reviving
the
practices
connected
with
this
cult
how
about
this
theo
i
have
heard
and
read
about
this
before
and
i
answer
that
no
more
utterly
baseless
and
lying
calumny
has
ever
been
invented
and
circulated
people
can
see
but
silly
dreams
says
a
russian
proverb
it
makes
blood
boil
to
hear
such
vile
accusations
made
without
the
slightest
foundation
and
on
the
strength
of
mere
inferences
ask
the
hundreds
of
honourable
english
men
and
women
who
have
been
members
of
the
theosophical
society
for
years
whether
an
precept
or
a
doctrine
was
ever
taught
to
them
open
the
and
you
will
find
page
after
page
denouncing
the
jews
and
other
nations
precisely
on
account
of
this
devotion
to
phallic
rites
due
to
the
dead
letter
interpretation
of
nature
symbolism
and
the
grossly
materialistic
conceptions
of
her
dualism
in
all
the
creeds
such
ceaseless
and
malicious
misrepresentation
of
our
teachings
and
beliefs
is
really
disgraceful
enq
but
you
can
not
deny
that
the
phallic
element
exist
in
the
religions
of
the
east
theo
nor
do
i
deny
it
only
i
maintain
that
this
proves
no
more
than
does
its
presence
in
christianity
the
religion
of
the
west
read
hargrave
if
you
would
assure
yourself
of
it
in
the
east
the
phallic
symbolism
is
perhaps
more
crude
because
more
true
to
nature
or
i
would
rather
say
more
and
sincere
than
in
the
west
but
it
is
not
more
licentious
nor
does
it
suggest
to
the
oriental
mind
the
same
gross
and
coarse
ideas
as
to
the
western
with
perhaps
one
or
two
exceptions
such
as
the
shameful
sect
known
as
the
or
sect
enq
a
writer
in
the
of
your
just
hinted
that
the
followers
of
this
disgraceful
sect
are
theosophists
and
true
theosophic
theo
he
wrote
a
falsehood
and
all
there
never
was
nor
is
there
at
present
one
single
vallabhachârya
in
our
society
as
to
their
having
or
claiming
theosophic
insight
that
is
another
fib
based
on
crass
ignorance
about
the
indian
sects
their
only
claims
a
right
to
the
money
wives
and
daughters
of
his
foolish
followers
and
no
more
this
sect
is
despised
by
all
the
other
hindus
but
you
will
find
the
whole
subject
dealt
with
at
length
in
the
to
which
i
must
again
refer
you
for
detailed
explanations
to
conclude
the
very
soul
of
theosophy
is
dead
against
phallic
worship
and
its
occult
or
esoteric
section
more
so
even
than
the
exoteric
teachings
there
never
was
a
more
lying
statement
made
than
the
above
and
now
ask
me
some
other
questions
is
the
theosophical
society
a
concern
enq
agreed
well
have
either
of
the
founders
colonel
olcott
or
blavatsky
ever
made
any
money
profit
or
derived
any
worldly
benefit
from
the
as
some
papers
say
theo
not
one
penny
the
papers
lie
on
the
contrary
they
have
both
given
all
they
had
and
literally
beggared
themselves
as
for
benefits
think
of
the
calumnies
and
vilification
they
have
been
subjected
to
and
then
ask
the
question
enq
yet
i
have
read
in
a
good
many
missionary
organs
that
the
entrance
fees
and
subscriptions
much
more
than
covered
all
expenses
and
one
said
that
the
founders
were
making
twenty
thousand
pounds
a
year
theo
this
is
a
fib
like
many
others
in
the
published
accounts
of
january
you
will
find
an
exact
statement
of
the
money
ever
received
from
any
source
since
the
total
received
from
all
sources
entrance
fees
donations
etc
during
these
ten
years
is
under
six
thousand
pounds
and
of
this
a
large
part
was
contributed
by
the
founders
themselves
from
the
proceeds
of
their
private
resources
and
their
literary
work
all
this
has
been
openly
and
officially
admitted
even
by
our
enemies
the
psychic
research
society
and
now
both
the
founders
are
penniless
one
too
old
and
ill
to
work
as
she
did
before
unable
to
spare
time
for
outside
literary
work
to
help
the
society
in
money
can
only
write
for
the
theosophical
cause
the
other
keeps
labouring
for
it
as
before
and
receives
as
little
thanks
for
it
enq
but
surely
they
need
money
to
live
theo
not
at
all
so
long
as
they
have
food
and
lodging
even
though
they
owe
it
to
the
devotion
of
a
few
friends
they
need
little
more
enq
but
could
not
madame
blavatsky
especially
make
more
than
enough
to
live
upon
by
her
writings
theo
when
in
india
she
received
on
the
average
some
thousand
rupees
a
year
for
articles
contributed
to
russian
and
other
papers
but
gave
it
all
away
to
the
society
enq
political
articles
theo
never
everything
she
has
written
throughout
the
seven
years
of
her
stay
in
india
is
all
there
in
print
it
deals
only
with
the
religions
ethnology
and
customs
of
india
and
with
with
politics
of
which
she
knows
nothing
and
cares
less
again
two
years
ago
she
refused
several
contracts
amounting
together
to
about
roubles
in
gold
per
month
for
she
could
not
accept
them
without
abandoning
her
work
for
the
society
which
needed
all
her
time
and
strength
she
has
documents
to
prove
it
enq
but
why
could
not
both
she
and
colonel
olcott
do
as
many
follow
out
their
respective
professions
and
devote
the
surplus
of
their
time
to
the
work
of
the
society
theo
because
by
serving
two
masters
either
the
professional
or
the
philanthropic
work
would
have
had
to
suffer
every
true
theosophist
is
morally
bound
to
sacrifice
the
personal
to
the
impersonal
his
own
good
to
the
benefit
of
other
people
if
the
founders
do
not
set
the
example
who
will
enq
and
are
there
many
who
follow
it
theo
i
am
bound
to
answer
you
the
truth
in
europe
about
in
all
out
of
more
than
that
number
of
branches
enq
then
it
is
not
true
that
the
theosophical
society
has
a
large
capital
or
endowment
of
its
own
theo
it
is
false
for
it
has
none
at
all
now
that
the
entrance
fee
of
and
the
small
annual
due
have
been
abolished
it
is
even
a
doubtful
question
whether
the
staff
at
the
headquarters
in
india
will
not
soon
be
starved
to
death
enq
then
why
not
raise
subscriptions
theo
we
are
not
the
salvation
army
we
and
begged
nor
have
we
ever
followed
the
example
of
the
churches
and
sects
and
up
that
which
is
occasionally
sent
for
the
support
of
the
society
the
small
sums
contributed
by
some
devoted
fellows
are
all
voluntary
donations
enq
but
i
have
heard
of
large
sums
of
money
given
to
mdme
blavatsky
it
was
said
four
years
ago
that
she
got
from
one
rich
young
who
went
out
to
join
them
in
india
and
from
another
wealthy
and
american
gentleman
one
of
your
members
who
died
in
europe
four
years
ago
theo
say
to
those
who
told
you
this
that
they
either
themselves
utter
or
repeat
a
gross
falsehood
or
one
penny
from
the
two
gentlemen
nor
anything
like
that
from
anyone
else
since
the
theosophical
society
was
founded
let
any
man
living
try
to
substantiate
this
calumny
and
it
will
be
easier
for
him
to
prove
that
the
bank
of
england
is
a
bankrupt
than
that
the
said
has
ever
made
any
money
out
of
theosophy
these
two
calumnies
have
been
started
by
two
ladies
belonging
to
the
london
aristocracy
and
have
been
immediately
traced
and
disproved
they
are
the
dead
bodies
the
carcases
of
two
inventions
which
after
having
been
buried
in
the
sea
of
oblivion
are
once
more
raised
on
the
surface
of
the
stagnant
waters
of
slander
enq
then
i
have
been
told
of
several
large
left
to
the
left
to
it
by
some
eccentric
englishman
who
did
not
even
belong
to
the
society
the
or
testated
by
an
australian
is
this
true
theo
i
heard
of
the
first
and
i
also
know
that
whether
legally
left
or
not
the
has
never
profited
by
it
nor
have
the
founders
ever
been
officially
notified
of
it
for
as
our
society
was
not
then
a
chartered
body
and
thus
had
no
legal
existence
the
judge
at
the
court
of
probate
as
we
were
told
paid
no
attention
to
such
legacy
and
turned
over
the
sum
to
the
heirs
so
much
for
the
first
as
for
the
second
it
is
quite
true
the
testator
was
one
of
our
devoted
fellows
and
willed
all
he
had
to
the
but
when
the
president
colonel
olcott
came
to
look
into
the
matter
he
found
that
the
testator
had
children
whom
he
had
disinherited
for
some
family
reasons
therefore
he
called
a
council
and
it
was
decided
that
the
legacy
should
be
refused
and
the
moneys
passed
to
the
legal
heirs
the
theosophical
society
would
be
untrue
to
its
name
were
it
to
profit
by
money
to
which
others
are
entitled
virtually
at
any
rate
on
theosophical
principles
if
not
legally
enq
again
and
i
say
this
on
the
authority
of
your
own
journal
the
a
rajah
of
india
who
donated
to
the
society
rupees
have
you
not
thanked
him
for
his
great
bounty
in
the
january
for
theo
we
have
in
these
words
the
thanks
of
the
convention
be
conveyed
to
the
maharajah
for
his
munificent
of
rupees
to
the
the
thanks
were
duly
conveyed
but
the
money
is
still
a
and
has
never
reached
the
headquarters
enq
but
surely
if
the
maharajah
promised
and
received
thanks
for
his
gift
publicly
and
in
print
he
will
be
as
good
as
his
promise
theo
he
may
though
the
promise
is
months
old
i
speak
of
the
present
and
not
of
the
future
enq
then
how
do
you
propose
to
go
on
theo
so
long
as
the
has
a
few
devoted
members
willing
to
work
for
it
without
reward
and
thanks
so
long
as
a
few
good
theosophists
support
it
with
occasional
donations
so
long
will
it
exist
and
nothing
can
crush
it
enq
i
have
heard
many
theosophists
speak
of
a
behind
the
and
of
certain
mentioned
also
in
works
that
are
said
to
have
founded
the
society
to
watch
over
and
protect
it
theo
you
may
laugh
but
it
is
so
the
working
staff
of
the
enq
these
men
i
have
heard
are
great
adepts
alchemists
and
what
not
if
then
they
can
change
lead
into
gold
and
make
as
much
money
as
they
like
besides
doing
all
kinds
of
miracles
at
will
as
related
in
world
why
do
not
they
find
you
money
and
support
the
founders
and
the
society
in
comfort
theo
because
they
did
not
found
a
because
the
society
is
intended
to
help
men
to
develop
the
powers
latent
in
them
through
their
own
exertions
and
merit
because
whatever
they
may
or
may
not
produce
in
the
way
of
phenomena
they
are
not
nor
would
they
throw
an
additional
and
very
strong
temptation
on
the
path
of
members
and
candidates
is
not
to
be
hitherto
for
the
past
years
not
a
single
working
member
has
ever
received
pay
or
salary
from
either
the
masters
or
the
society
enq
then
are
none
of
your
workers
paid
at
all
theo
till
now
not
one
but
as
every
one
has
to
eat
drink
and
clothe
himself
all
those
who
are
without
any
means
of
their
own
and
devote
their
whole
time
to
the
work
of
the
society
are
provided
with
the
necessaries
of
life
at
the
headquarters
at
madras
india
though
these
are
humble
enough
in
truth
see
rules
at
the
end
but
now
that
the
work
has
increased
so
greatly
and
still
goes
on
in
increasing
to
in
europe
we
need
more
working
hands
we
hope
to
have
a
few
members
who
will
henceforth
be
the
word
be
used
in
the
cases
in
question
for
every
one
of
these
fellows
who
are
preparing
to
give
their
time
to
the
society
are
quitting
good
official
situations
with
excellent
prospects
to
work
for
us
at
than
half
their
former
enq
and
who
will
provide
the
funds
for
this
theo
some
of
our
fellows
who
are
just
a
little
richer
than
the
rest
the
man
who
would
speculate
or
make
money
on
theosophy
would
be
unworthy
to
remain
in
our
ranks
enq
but
you
must
surely
make
money
by
your
books
magazines
and
other
publications
theo
the
of
madras
alone
among
the
magazines
pays
a
profit
and
this
has
regularly
been
turned
over
to
the
society
year
by
year
as
the
published
accounts
show
is
slowly
but
steadily
ingulfing
money
never
yet
having
paid
to
its
being
boycotted
by
the
pious
booksellers
and
railway
stalls
the
in
on
the
private
and
not
very
large
means
of
a
theosophist
who
has
devoted
to
it
his
whole
time
and
ceased
to
exist
owing
to
the
same
causes
alas
nor
does
the
new
york
pay
its
way
while
the
of
paris
has
only
just
been
started
also
from
the
private
means
of
a
moreover
whenever
any
of
the
works
issued
by
the
theosophical
publishing
company
in
london
do
pay
the
proceeds
will
be
devoted
to
the
service
of
the
society
enq
and
now
please
tell
me
all
you
can
about
the
mahatmas
so
many
absurd
and
contradictory
things
are
said
about
them
that
one
does
not
know
what
to
believe
and
all
sorts
of
ridiculous
stories
become
current
theo
well
may
you
call
them
xiv
the
are
they
of
or
enq
who
are
they
finally
those
whom
you
call
your
some
say
they
are
or
some
other
kind
of
supernatural
beings
while
others
call
them
theo
they
are
neither
i
once
heard
one
outsider
say
to
another
that
they
were
a
sort
of
whatever
such
a
creature
may
be
but
if
you
listen
to
what
people
say
you
will
never
have
a
true
conception
of
them
in
the
first
place
they
are
born
as
we
are
born
and
doomed
to
die
like
every
other
mortal
enq
yes
but
it
is
rumoured
that
some
of
them
are
a
thousand
years
old
is
this
true
theo
as
true
as
the
miraculous
growth
of
hair
on
the
head
of
shagpat
truly
like
the
no
theosophical
shaving
has
hitherto
been
able
to
crop
it
the
more
we
deny
them
the
more
we
try
to
set
people
right
the
more
absurd
do
the
inventions
become
i
have
heard
of
methuselah
being
years
old
but
not
being
forced
to
believe
in
it
have
laughed
at
the
statement
for
which
i
was
forthwith
regarded
by
many
as
a
blasphemous
heretic
enq
seriously
though
do
they
outlive
the
ordinary
age
of
men
theo
what
do
you
call
the
ordinary
age
i
remember
reading
in
the
of
a
mexican
who
was
almost
years
old
but
i
have
never
heard
of
mortal
man
layman
or
adept
who
could
live
even
half
the
years
allotted
to
methuselah
some
adepts
do
exceed
by
a
good
deal
what
you
would
call
the
ordinary
age
yet
there
is
nothing
miraculous
in
it
and
very
few
of
them
care
to
live
very
long
enq
but
what
does
the
word
really
mean
theo
simply
a
soul
great
through
moral
elevation
and
intellectual
attainment
if
the
title
of
great
is
given
to
a
drunken
soldier
like
alexander
why
should
we
not
call
those
who
have
achieved
far
greater
conquests
in
secrets
than
alexander
ever
did
on
the
field
of
battle
besides
the
term
is
an
indian
and
a
very
old
word
enq
and
why
do
you
call
them
theo
we
call
them
because
they
are
our
teachers
and
because
from
them
we
have
derived
all
the
theosophical
truths
however
inadequately
some
of
us
may
have
expressed
and
others
understood
them
they
are
men
of
great
learning
whom
we
term
initiates
and
still
greater
holiness
of
life
they
are
not
ascetics
in
the
ordinary
sense
though
they
certainly
remain
apart
from
the
turmoil
and
strife
of
your
western
world
enq
but
is
it
not
selfish
thus
to
isolate
themselves
theo
where
is
the
selfishness
does
not
the
fate
of
the
theosophical
society
sufficiently
prove
that
the
world
is
neither
ready
to
recognise
them
nor
to
profit
by
their
teaching
of
what
use
would
professor
clerk
maxwell
have
been
to
instruct
a
class
of
little
boys
in
their
besides
they
isolate
themselves
only
from
the
west
in
their
own
country
they
go
about
as
publicly
as
other
people
do
enq
you
ascribe
to
them
supernatural
powers
theo
we
believe
in
nothing
supernatural
as
i
have
told
you
already
had
edison
lived
and
invented
his
phonograph
two
hundred
years
ago
he
would
most
probably
have
been
burnt
along
with
it
and
the
whole
attributed
to
the
devil
the
powers
which
they
exercise
are
simply
the
development
of
potencies
lying
latent
in
every
man
and
woman
and
the
existence
of
which
even
official
science
begins
to
recognise
enq
is
it
true
that
these
men
some
of
your
writers
and
that
many
if
not
all
of
your
theosophical
works
were
written
under
their
dictation
theo
some
have
there
are
passages
entirely
dictated
by
them
and
but
in
most
cases
they
only
inspire
the
ideas
and
leave
the
literary
form
to
the
writers
enq
but
this
in
itself
is
miraculous
is
in
fact
a
how
can
they
do
it
theo
my
dear
sir
you
are
labouring
under
a
great
mistake
and
it
is
science
itself
that
will
refute
your
arguments
at
no
distant
day
why
should
it
be
a
as
you
call
it
a
miracle
is
supposed
to
mean
some
operation
which
is
supernatural
whereas
there
is
really
nothing
above
or
beyond
nature
and
laws
among
the
many
forms
of
the
which
have
come
under
modern
scientific
recognition
there
is
hypnotism
and
one
phase
of
its
power
is
known
as
a
form
of
thought
transference
which
has
been
successfully
used
in
combating
particular
physical
diseases
etc
the
time
is
not
far
distant
when
the
world
of
science
will
be
forced
to
acknowledge
that
there
exists
as
much
interaction
between
one
mind
and
another
no
matter
at
what
distance
as
between
one
body
and
another
in
closest
contact
when
two
minds
are
sympathetically
related
and
the
instruments
through
which
they
function
are
tuned
to
respond
magnetically
and
electrically
to
one
another
there
is
nothing
which
will
prevent
the
transmission
of
thoughts
from
one
to
the
other
at
will
for
since
the
mind
is
not
of
a
tangible
nature
that
distance
can
divide
it
from
the
subject
of
its
contemplation
it
follows
that
the
only
difference
that
can
exist
between
two
minds
is
a
difference
of
state
so
if
this
latter
hindrance
is
overcome
where
is
the
of
at
whatever
distance
enq
but
you
will
admit
that
hypnotism
does
nothing
so
miraculous
or
wonderful
as
that
theo
on
the
contrary
it
is
a
fact
that
a
hypnotist
can
affect
the
brain
of
his
subject
so
far
as
to
produce
an
expression
of
his
own
thoughts
and
even
his
words
through
the
organism
of
his
subject
and
although
the
phenomena
attaching
to
this
method
of
actual
thought
transference
are
as
yet
few
in
number
no
one
i
presume
will
undertake
to
say
how
far
their
action
may
extend
in
the
future
when
the
laws
that
govern
their
production
are
more
scientifically
established
and
so
if
such
results
can
be
produced
by
the
knowledge
of
the
mere
rudiments
of
hypnotism
what
can
prevent
the
adept
in
psychic
and
spiritual
powers
from
producing
results
which
with
your
present
limited
knowledge
of
their
laws
you
are
inclined
to
call
enq
then
why
do
not
our
physicians
experiment
and
try
if
they
could
not
do
as
much
theo
because
first
of
all
they
are
not
adepts
with
a
thorough
understanding
of
the
secrets
and
laws
of
psychic
and
spiritual
realms
but
materialists
afraid
to
step
outside
the
narrow
groove
of
matter
and
secondly
because
they
at
present
and
indeed
until
they
are
brought
to
acknowledge
that
such
powers
are
attainable
enq
and
could
they
be
taught
theo
not
unless
they
were
first
of
all
prepared
by
having
the
materialistic
dross
they
have
accumulated
in
their
brains
swept
away
to
the
very
last
atom
enq
this
is
very
interesting
tell
me
have
the
adepts
thus
inspired
or
dictated
to
many
of
your
theosophists
theo
no
on
the
contrary
to
very
few
such
operations
require
special
conditions
an
unscrupulous
but
skilled
adept
of
the
black
brotherhood
of
the
shadow
and
dugpas
we
call
them
has
far
less
difficulties
to
labour
under
for
having
no
laws
of
the
spiritual
kind
to
trammel
his
actions
such
a
dugpa
will
most
unceremoniously
obtain
control
over
any
mind
and
subject
it
entirely
to
his
evil
powers
but
our
masters
will
never
do
that
they
have
no
right
except
by
falling
into
black
magic
to
obtain
full
mastery
over
immortal
ego
and
can
therefore
act
only
on
the
physical
and
psychic
nature
of
the
subject
leaving
thereby
the
free
will
of
the
latter
wholly
undisturbed
hence
unless
a
person
has
been
brought
into
psychic
relationship
with
the
masters
and
is
assisted
by
virtue
of
his
full
faith
in
and
devotion
to
his
teachers
the
latter
whenever
transmitting
their
thoughts
to
one
with
whom
these
conditions
are
not
fulfilled
experience
great
difficulties
in
penetrating
into
the
cloudy
chaos
of
that
sphere
but
this
is
no
place
to
treat
of
a
subject
of
this
nature
suffice
it
to
say
that
if
the
power
exists
then
there
are
intelligences
embodied
or
disembodied
which
guide
this
power
and
living
conscious
instruments
through
whom
it
is
transmitted
and
by
whom
it
is
received
we
have
only
to
beware
of
magic
enq
but
what
do
you
really
mean
by
theo
simply
of
psychic
or
of
any
of
the
fact
of
applying
to
selfish
and
sinful
ends
the
powers
of
occultism
a
hypnotiser
who
taking
advantage
of
his
powers
of
forces
a
subject
to
steal
or
murder
would
be
called
a
by
us
the
famous
of
of
paris
through
a
loathsome
into
human
discovery
all
the
medical
papers
of
europe
are
now
true
is
black
enq
but
this
is
mediæval
belief
in
witchcraft
and
sorcery
even
law
itself
has
ceased
to
believe
in
such
things
theo
so
much
the
worse
for
law
as
it
has
been
led
through
such
a
lack
of
discrimination
into
committing
more
than
one
judiciary
mistake
and
crime
it
is
the
term
alone
that
frightens
you
with
its
ring
in
it
would
not
law
punish
an
abuse
of
hypnotic
powers
as
i
just
mentioned
nay
it
has
so
punished
it
already
in
france
and
germany
yet
it
would
indignantly
deny
that
it
applied
punishment
to
a
crime
of
evident
you
can
not
believe
in
the
efficacy
and
reality
of
the
of
by
physicians
and
mesmerisers
or
hypnotisers
and
then
refuse
to
believe
in
the
same
powers
when
used
for
evil
motives
and
if
you
do
then
you
believe
in
yon
can
not
believe
in
good
and
disbelieve
in
evil
accept
genuine
money
and
refuse
to
credit
such
a
thing
as
false
coin
nothing
can
exist
without
its
contrast
and
no
day
no
light
no
good
could
have
any
representation
as
such
in
your
consciousness
were
there
no
night
darkness
nor
evil
to
offset
and
contrast
them
enq
indeed
i
have
known
men
who
while
thoroughly
believing
in
that
which
you
call
great
psychic
or
magic
powers
laughed
at
the
very
mention
of
witchcraft
and
sorcery
theo
what
does
it
prove
simply
that
they
are
illogical
so
much
the
worse
for
them
again
and
we
knowing
as
we
do
of
the
existence
of
good
and
holy
adepts
believe
as
thoroughly
in
the
existence
of
bad
and
unholy
adepts
enq
but
if
the
masters
exist
why
they
come
out
before
all
men
and
refute
once
for
all
the
many
charges
which
are
made
against
mdme
blavatsky
and
the
society
theo
what
charges
enq
that
do
not
exist
and
that
she
has
invented
them
that
they
are
men
of
straw
of
muslin
and
does
not
all
this
injure
her
reputation
theo
in
what
way
can
such
an
accusation
injure
her
in
reality
did
she
ever
make
money
on
their
presumed
existence
or
derive
benefit
or
fame
therefrom
i
answer
that
she
has
gained
only
insults
abuse
and
calumnies
which
would
have
been
very
painful
had
she
not
learned
long
ago
to
remain
perfectly
indifferent
to
such
false
charges
for
what
does
it
amount
to
after
all
why
to
an
which
if
the
fools
her
accusers
were
not
carried
away
by
their
blind
hatred
they
would
have
thought
twice
before
uttering
to
say
that
she
has
invented
the
masters
comes
to
this
she
must
have
invented
every
bit
of
philosophy
that
has
ever
been
given
out
in
theosophical
literature
she
must
be
the
author
of
the
letters
from
which
was
written
the
sole
inventor
of
every
tenet
found
in
the
doctrine
which
if
the
world
were
just
would
be
recognised
as
supplying
many
of
the
missing
links
of
science
as
will
be
discovered
a
hundred
years
hence
by
saying
what
they
do
they
are
also
giving
her
the
credit
of
being
far
cleverer
than
the
hundreds
of
men
many
clever
and
not
a
few
scientific
men
who
believe
in
what
she
as
she
must
have
fooled
them
all
if
they
speak
the
truth
then
she
must
be
several
mahatmas
rolled
into
one
like
a
nest
of
chinese
boxes
since
among
the
are
many
in
totally
different
and
distinct
styles
all
of
which
her
accusers
declare
that
she
has
written
enq
it
is
just
what
they
say
but
is
it
not
very
painful
to
her
to
be
publicly
denounced
as
most
accomplished
impostor
of
the
age
whose
name
deserves
to
pass
to
posterity
as
is
done
in
the
report
of
the
for
psychical
theo
it
might
be
painful
if
it
were
true
or
came
from
people
less
rabidly
materialistic
and
prejudiced
as
it
is
personally
she
treats
the
whole
matter
with
contempt
while
the
mahatmas
simply
laugh
at
it
in
truth
it
is
the
greatest
compliment
that
could
be
paid
to
her
i
say
so
again
enq
but
her
enemies
claim
to
have
proved
their
case
theo
aye
it
is
easy
enough
to
make
such
a
claim
when
you
have
constituted
yourself
judge
jury
and
prosecuting
counsel
at
once
as
they
did
but
who
except
their
direct
followers
and
our
enemies
believe
in
it
enq
but
they
sent
a
representative
to
india
to
investigate
the
matter
they
theo
they
did
and
their
final
conclusion
rests
entirely
on
the
unchecked
statements
and
unverified
assertions
of
this
young
gentleman
a
lawyer
who
read
through
his
report
told
a
friend
of
mine
that
in
all
his
experience
he
had
never
seen
a
and
it
was
found
to
be
full
of
suppositions
and
which
mutually
destroy
each
other
is
this
a
serious
charge
enq
yet
it
has
done
the
society
great
harm
why
then
did
she
not
vindicate
her
own
character
at
least
before
a
court
of
law
theo
firstly
because
as
a
theosophist
it
is
her
duty
to
leave
unheeded
all
personal
insults
secondly
because
neither
the
society
nor
mdme
blavatsky
had
any
money
to
waste
over
such
a
and
lastly
because
it
would
have
been
ridiculous
for
both
to
be
untrue
to
their
principles
because
of
an
attack
made
on
them
by
a
flock
of
stupid
old
british
wethers
who
had
been
led
to
butt
at
them
by
an
over
frolicksome
lambkin
from
australia
enq
this
is
complimentary
but
do
you
not
think
that
it
would
have
done
real
good
to
the
cause
of
theosophy
if
she
had
authoritatively
disproved
the
whole
thing
once
for
all
theo
perhaps
but
do
you
believe
that
any
english
jury
or
judge
would
have
ever
admitted
the
reality
of
psychic
phenomena
even
if
entirely
unprejudiced
beforehand
and
when
you
remember
that
they
would
have
been
set
against
us
already
by
the
scare
the
charge
of
and
and
all
the
other
calumnies
that
have
been
circulated
against
us
you
can
not
fail
to
see
that
such
an
attempt
to
obtain
justice
in
a
court
of
law
would
have
been
worse
than
fruitless
all
this
the
psychic
researchers
knew
well
and
they
took
a
base
and
mean
advantage
of
their
position
to
raise
themselves
above
our
heads
and
save
themselves
at
our
expense
enq
the
now
denies
completely
the
existence
of
the
mahatmas
they
say
that
from
beginning
to
end
they
were
a
romance
which
madame
blavatsky
has
woven
from
her
own
brain
theo
well
she
might
have
done
many
things
less
clever
than
this
at
any
rate
we
have
not
the
slightest
objection
to
this
theory
as
she
always
says
now
she
almost
prefers
that
people
should
not
believe
in
the
masters
she
declares
openly
that
she
would
rather
people
should
seriously
think
that
the
only
mahatmaland
is
the
grey
matter
of
her
brain
and
that
in
short
she
has
evolved
them
out
of
the
depths
of
her
own
inner
consciousness
than
that
their
names
and
grand
ideal
should
be
so
infamously
desecrated
as
they
are
at
present
at
first
she
used
to
protest
indignantly
against
any
doubts
as
to
their
existence
now
she
never
goes
out
of
her
way
to
prove
or
disprove
it
let
people
think
what
they
like
enq
but
of
course
these
masters
exist
theo
we
affirm
nevertheless
this
does
not
help
much
many
people
even
some
theosophists
and
say
that
they
have
never
had
any
proof
of
their
existence
very
well
then
mme
blavatsky
replies
with
this
alternative
she
has
invented
them
then
she
has
also
invented
their
philosophy
and
the
practical
knowledge
which
some
few
have
acquired
and
if
so
what
does
it
matter
whether
they
do
exist
or
not
since
she
herself
is
here
and
own
at
any
rate
can
hardly
be
denied
if
the
knowledge
supposed
to
have
been
imparted
by
them
is
good
intrinsically
and
it
is
accepted
as
such
by
many
persons
of
more
than
average
intelligence
why
should
there
be
such
a
made
over
that
question
the
fact
of
her
being
an
impostor
never
been
and
will
always
remain
whereas
it
is
a
certain
and
undeniable
fact
that
by
whomsoever
invented
the
philosophy
preached
by
the
is
one
of
the
grandest
and
most
beneficent
philosophies
once
it
is
properly
understood
thus
the
slanderers
while
moved
by
the
lowest
and
meanest
of
hatred
revenge
malice
wounded
vanity
or
disappointed
ambition
quite
unaware
that
they
are
paying
the
greatest
tribute
to
her
intellectual
powers
so
be
it
if
the
poor
fools
will
have
it
so
really
mme
blavatsky
has
not
the
slightest
objection
to
being
represented
by
her
enemies
as
a
adept
and
a
to
boot
it
is
only
her
unwillingness
to
pose
in
her
own
sight
as
a
crow
parading
in
feathers
that
compels
her
to
this
day
to
insist
upon
the
truth
enq
but
if
you
have
such
wise
and
good
men
to
guide
the
society
how
is
it
that
so
many
mistakes
have
been
made
theo
the
masters
do
guide
the
society
not
even
the
founders
and
no
one
has
ever
asserted
that
they
did
they
only
watch
over
and
protect
it
this
is
amply
proved
by
the
fact
that
no
mistakes
have
been
able
to
cripple
it
and
no
scandals
from
within
nor
the
most
damaging
attacks
from
without
have
been
able
to
overthrow
it
the
masters
look
at
the
future
not
at
the
present
and
every
mistake
is
so
much
more
accumulated
wisdom
for
days
to
come
that
other
who
sent
the
man
with
the
five
talents
did
not
tell
him
how
to
double
them
nor
did
he
prevent
the
foolish
servant
from
burying
his
one
talent
in
the
earth
each
must
acquire
wisdom
by
his
own
experience
and
merits
the
christian
churches
who
claim
a
far
higher
the
very
holy
ghost
itself
have
ever
been
and
are
still
guilty
not
only
of
but
of
a
series
of
bloody
crimes
throughout
the
ages
yet
no
christian
would
deny
for
all
that
his
belief
in
i
suppose
although
his
existence
is
far
more
than
that
of
the
mahatmas
as
no
one
has
ever
seen
the
holy
ghost
and
guidance
of
the
church
moreover
their
own
ecclesiastical
history
distinctly
contradicts
humanum
let
us
return
to
our
subject
the
abuse
of
sacred
names
and
terms
enq
then
what
i
have
heard
namely
that
many
of
your
theosophical
writers
claim
to
have
been
inspired
by
these
masters
or
to
have
seen
and
conversed
with
them
is
not
true
theo
it
may
or
it
may
not
be
true
how
can
i
tell
the
burden
of
proof
rests
with
them
some
of
them
a
few
distinctly
either
or
were
hallucinated
when
boasting
of
such
inspiration
others
were
truly
inspired
by
great
adepts
the
tree
is
known
by
its
fruits
and
as
all
theosophists
have
to
be
judged
by
their
deeds
and
not
by
what
they
write
or
say
so
theosophical
books
must
be
accepted
on
their
merits
and
not
according
to
any
claim
to
authority
which
they
may
put
forward
enq
but
would
mdme
blavatsky
apply
this
to
her
own
for
instance
theo
certainly
she
says
expressly
in
the
preface
that
she
gives
out
the
doctrines
that
she
has
learnt
from
the
masters
but
claims
no
inspiration
whatever
for
what
she
has
lately
written
as
for
our
best
theosophists
they
would
also
in
this
case
far
rather
that
the
names
of
the
masters
had
never
been
mixed
up
with
our
books
in
any
way
with
few
exceptions
most
of
such
works
are
not
only
imperfect
but
positively
erroneous
and
misleading
great
are
the
desecrations
to
which
the
names
of
two
of
the
masters
have
been
subjected
there
is
hardly
a
medium
who
has
not
claimed
to
have
seen
them
every
bogus
swindling
society
for
commercial
purposes
now
claims
to
be
guided
and
directed
by
often
supposed
to
be
far
higher
than
ours
many
and
heavy
are
the
sins
of
those
who
advanced
these
claims
prompted
either
by
desire
for
lucre
vanity
or
irresponsible
mediumship
many
persons
have
been
plundered
of
their
money
by
such
societies
which
offer
to
sell
the
secrets
of
power
knowledge
and
spiritual
truth
for
worthless
gold
worst
of
all
the
sacred
names
of
occultism
and
the
holy
keepers
thereof
have
been
dragged
in
this
filthy
mire
polluted
by
being
associated
with
sordid
motives
and
immoral
practices
while
thousands
of
men
have
been
held
back
from
the
path
of
truth
and
light
through
the
discredit
and
evil
report
which
such
shams
swindles
and
frauds
have
brought
upon
the
whole
subject
i
say
again
every
earnest
theosophist
regrets
from
the
bottom
of
his
heart
that
these
sacred
names
and
things
have
ever
been
mentioned
before
the
public
and
fervently
wishes
that
they
had
been
kept
secret
within
a
small
circle
of
trusted
and
devoted
friends
enq
the
names
certainly
do
occur
very
frequently
and
i
never
remember
hearing
of
such
persons
as
till
quite
recently
theo
it
is
so
and
had
we
acted
on
the
wise
principle
of
silence
instead
of
rushing
into
notoriety
and
publishing
all
we
knew
and
heard
such
desecration
would
never
have
occurred
behold
only
fourteen
years
ago
before
the
theosophical
society
was
founded
all
the
talk
was
of
they
were
everywhere
in
mouth
and
no
one
by
any
chance
even
dreamt
of
talking
about
living
or
one
hardly
heard
even
the
name
of
the
rosicrucians
while
the
existence
of
such
a
thing
as
was
suspected
even
but
by
very
few
now
all
that
is
changed
we
theosophists
were
unfortunately
the
first
to
talk
of
these
things
to
make
the
fact
of
the
existence
in
the
east
of
and
and
occult
knowledge
known
and
now
the
name
has
become
common
property
it
is
on
us
now
that
the
karma
the
consequences
of
the
resulting
desecration
of
holy
names
and
things
has
fallen
all
that
you
now
find
about
such
matters
in
current
there
is
not
a
little
of
is
to
be
traced
back
to
the
impulse
given
in
this
direction
by
the
theosophical
society
and
its
founders
our
enemies
profit
to
this
day
by
our
mistake
the
most
recent
book
directed
against
our
teachings
is
alleged
to
have
been
written
an
adept
of
twenty
now
it
is
a
we
know
the
amanuensis
and
his
as
he
is
himself
too
ignorant
to
have
written
anything
of
the
sort
these
are
living
persons
revengeful
and
unscrupulous
in
proportion
to
their
intellectual
powers
and
these
adepts
are
not
one
but
several
the
cycle
of
used
as
to
break
the
theosophical
heads
with
began
twelve
years
ago
with
emma
hardinge
of
and
and
now
ends
with
the
and
of
light
of
a
work
written
by
spiritualists
against
theosophy
and
its
teachings
but
it
is
useless
to
grieve
over
what
is
done
and
we
can
only
suffer
in
the
hope
that
our
indiscretions
may
have
made
it
a
little
easier
for
others
to
find
the
way
to
these
masters
whose
names
are
now
everywhere
taken
in
vain
and
under
cover
of
which
so
many
iniquities
have
already
been
perpetrated
enq
do
you
reject
as
an
adept
theo
we
denounce
no
one
leaving
this
noble
task
to
our
enemies
the
spiritualistic
author
of
may
or
may
not
have
been
acquainted
with
such
an
saying
this
i
say
far
less
than
what
that
lady
has
said
and
written
about
us
and
theosophy
for
the
last
several
is
her
own
business
only
when
in
a
solemn
scene
of
mystic
vision
an
alleged
sees
presumably
at
greenwich
england
through
lord
telescope
which
was
built
in
and
never
moved
from
parsonstown
ireland
i
may
well
be
permitted
to
wonder
at
the
ignorance
of
that
in
matters
of
science
this
beats
all
the
mistakes
and
blunders
committed
at
times
by
the
of
our
teachers
and
it
is
this
that
is
used
now
to
break
the
teachings
of
our
masters
enq
i
quite
understand
your
feeling
in
this
matter
and
think
it
only
natural
and
now
in
view
of
all
that
you
have
said
and
explained
to
me
there
is
one
subject
on
which
i
should
like
to
ask
you
a
few
questions
theo
if
i
can
answer
them
i
will
what
is
that
footnotes
such
for
instance
as

part
conclusion
the
future
of
the
theosophical
society
enq
tell
me
what
do
you
expect
for
theosophy
in
the
future
theo
if
you
speak
of
theosophy
i
answer
that
as
it
has
existed
eternally
throughout
the
endless
cycles
upon
cycles
of
the
past
so
it
will
ever
exist
throughout
the
infinitudes
of
the
future
because
theosophy
is
synonymous
with
everlasting
truth
enq
pardon
me
i
meant
to
ask
you
rather
about
the
prospects
of
the
theosophical
society
theo
its
future
will
depend
almost
entirely
upon
the
degree
of
selflessness
earnestness
devotion
and
last
but
not
least
on
the
amount
of
knowledge
and
wisdom
possessed
by
those
members
on
whom
it
will
fall
to
carry
on
the
work
and
to
direct
the
society
after
the
death
of
the
founders
enq
i
quite
see
the
importance
of
their
being
selfless
and
devoted
but
i
do
not
quite
grasp
how
their
can
be
as
vital
a
factor
in
the
question
as
these
other
qualities
surely
the
literature
which
already
exists
and
to
which
constant
additions
are
still
being
made
ought
to
be
sufficient
theo
i
do
not
refer
to
technical
knowledge
of
the
esoteric
doctrine
though
that
is
most
important
i
spoke
rather
of
the
great
need
which
our
successors
in
the
guidance
of
the
society
will
have
of
unbiased
and
clear
judgment
every
such
attempt
as
the
theosophical
society
has
hitherto
ended
in
failure
because
sooner
or
later
it
has
degenerated
into
a
sect
set
up
dogmas
of
its
own
and
so
lost
by
imperceptible
degrees
that
vitality
which
living
truth
alone
can
impart
you
must
remember
that
all
our
members
have
been
bred
and
born
in
some
creed
or
religion
that
all
are
more
or
less
of
their
generation
both
physically
and
mentally
and
consequently
that
their
judgment
is
but
too
likely
to
be
warped
and
unconsciously
biased
by
some
or
all
of
these
influences
if
then
they
can
not
be
freed
from
such
inherent
bias
or
at
least
taught
to
recognise
it
instantly
and
so
avoid
being
led
away
by
it
the
result
can
only
be
that
the
society
will
drift
off
on
to
some
sandbank
of
thought
or
another
and
there
remain
a
stranded
carcass
to
moulder
and
die
enq
but
if
this
danger
be
averted
theo
then
the
society
will
live
on
into
and
through
the
twentieth
century
it
will
gradually
leaven
and
permeate
the
great
mass
of
thinking
and
intelligent
people
with
its
and
noble
ideas
of
religion
duty
and
philanthropy
slowly
but
surely
it
will
burst
asunder
the
iron
fetters
of
creeds
and
dogmas
of
social
and
caste
prejudices
it
will
break
down
racial
and
national
antipathies
and
barriers
and
will
open
the
way
to
the
practical
realisation
of
the
brotherhood
of
all
men
through
its
teaching
through
the
philosophy
which
it
has
rendered
accessible
and
intelligible
to
the
modern
mind
the
west
will
learn
to
understand
and
appreciate
the
east
at
its
true
value
further
the
development
of
the
psychic
powers
and
faculties
the
premonitory
symptoms
of
which
are
already
visible
in
america
will
proceed
healthily
and
normally
mankind
will
be
saved
from
the
terrible
dangers
both
mental
and
bodily
which
are
inevitable
when
that
unfolding
takes
place
as
it
threatens
to
do
in
a
of
selfishness
and
all
evil
passions
mental
and
psychic
growth
will
proceed
in
harmony
with
his
moral
improvement
while
his
material
surroundings
will
reflect
the
peace
and
fraternal
goodwill
which
will
reign
in
his
mind
instead
of
the
discord
and
strife
which
is
everywhere
apparent
around
us
enq
a
truly
delightful
picture
but
tell
me
do
you
really
expect
all
this
to
be
accomplished
in
one
short
century
theo
scarcely
but
i
must
tell
you
that
during
the
last
quarter
of
every
hundred
years
an
attempt
is
made
by
those
of
whom
i
have
spoken
to
help
on
the
spiritual
progress
of
humanity
in
a
marked
and
definite
way
towards
the
close
of
each
century
you
will
invariably
find
that
an
outpouring
or
upheaval
of
call
it
mysticism
if
you
taken
place
some
one
or
more
persons
have
appeared
in
the
world
as
their
agents
and
a
greater
or
less
amount
of
occult
knowledge
and
teaching
has
been
given
out
if
you
care
to
do
so
you
can
trace
these
movements
back
century
by
century
as
far
as
our
detailed
historical
records
extend
enq
but
how
does
this
bear
on
the
future
of
the
theosophical
society
theo
if
the
present
attempt
in
the
form
of
our
society
succeeds
better
than
its
predecessors
have
done
then
it
will
be
in
existence
as
an
organized
living
and
healthy
body
when
the
time
comes
for
the
effort
of
the
xxth
century
the
general
condition
of
minds
and
hearts
will
have
been
improved
and
purified
by
the
spread
of
its
teachings
and
as
i
have
said
their
prejudices
and
dogmatic
illusions
will
have
been
to
some
extent
at
least
removed
not
only
so
but
besides
a
large
and
accessible
literature
ready
to
hands
the
next
impulse
will
find
a
numerous
and
body
of
people
ready
to
welcome
the
new
of
truth
he
will
find
the
minds
of
men
prepared
for
his
message
a
language
ready
for
him
in
which
to
clothe
the
new
truths
he
brings
an
organization
awaiting
his
arrival
which
will
remove
the
merely
mechanical
material
obstacles
and
difficulties
from
his
path
think
how
much
one
to
whom
such
an
opportunity
is
given
could
accomplish
measure
it
by
comparison
with
what
the
theosophical
society
actually
achieved
in
the
last
fourteen
years
without
of
these
advantages
and
surrounded
by
hosts
of
hindrances
which
would
not
hamper
the
new
leader
consider
all
this
and
then
tell
me
whether
i
am
too
sanguine
when
i
say
that
if
the
theosophical
society
survives
and
lives
true
to
its
mission
to
its
original
impulses
through
the
next
hundred
me
i
say
if
i
go
too
far
in
asserting
that
earth
will
be
a
heaven
in
the
century
in
comparison
with
what
it
is
now
finis
the
united
lodge
of
theosophists
declaration
the
policy
of
this
lodge
is
independent
devotion
to
the
cause
of
theosophy
without
professing
attachment
to
any
theosophical
organization
it
is
loyal
to
the
great
founders
of
the
theosophical
movement
but
does
not
concern
itself
with
dissensions
or
differences
of
individual
opinion
the
work
it
has
on
hand
and
the
end
it
keeps
in
view
are
too
absorbing
and
too
lofty
to
leave
it
the
time
or
inclination
to
take
part
in
side
issues
that
work
and
that
end
is
the
dissemination
of
the
fundamental
principles
of
the
philosophy
of
theosophy
and
the
exemplification
in
practice
of
those
principles
through
a
truer
realization
of
the
self
a
profounder
conviction
of
universal
brotherhood
it
holds
that
the
unassailable
for
among
theosophists
wherever
and
however
situated
is
of
aim
purpose
and
and
therefore
has
neither
constitution
nor
officers
the
sole
bond
between
its
associates
being
that
and
it
aims
to
disseminate
this
idea
among
theosophists
in
the
furtherance
of
unity
it
regards
as
theosophists
all
who
are
engaged
in
the
true
service
of
humanity
without
distinction
of
race
creed
sex
condition
or
organization

it
welcomes

its

all
those
who
are
in
