it

that
the

of
obtaining
knowledge
is
one
of
the
most
natural
and
at
the
same
time
most
ennobling
attributes
of
the
human
mind
there
is
at
the

a
great
number
of
inquiring
minds
among
the
working
classes
of
this
kingdom
and
a
still
greater
number
of
the
young
of
all
classes
thirsting
for
information
who
in
entering
upon
a
course
of
general
reading
must
be
greatly
at
a
loss
for
many
things
which
are
familiarly
alluded
to
in
ordinary
conversation
with
which
everybody
is
understood
to
be
acquainted
or
would
have
people
to
think
so
but
which
in
reality
are
only
familiar
to
persons
who
have
been
living
for
a
considerable
time
in
intimate
converse
with
the

the

such

that

of

printing
undoubtedly
stands
and
if
viewed
in

full
extent
it
may
be
truly
said
to
possess
a
very
considerable
portion
not
only
of
the
comforts
but
the
conveniences
and
positive
utilities
of
life
the
advantages
derived
from
this
invention
must
be
acknowledged
by
all
this
art
has
proved
the
principal
step
towards
civilization
by
it
has
christianity
been
propagated
and
by
its
powerful
means
are
we
made
acquainted
with
all
that
is
useful
in

in
art
and
science
it
would
take
the
pen
of
an
inspired
writer
to
enumerate
all
the
blessings
which
flow
from
it
it
is
a
patent
engine
which
possesses
a
preponderating
influence
over
the
mind
of
man
either
for
good
or
evil
according
as
it
is
used
as
we
proceed
we
will
have
frequent
occasion
to
express
our
feelings
in
grateful
eulogium
when
considering
the
benefits
resulting
to
society
from
various
ingenious
inventions
and
discoveries
but
when
we
consider
the
advantages
derived
from
the
typographic
art
it
appears
like
a
vortex
drawing
every
other
sensation
into
its
deep
interest
and
engulphing
every
consideration
so
that
we
can
think
of
nothing
but
printing
and
its
extensive
catalogue
of
benefits
this
interest
is
wonderfully
increased
whether
it
be
viewed
on
account
of
its
ingenuity
the
extent
of
its
benefits
or
the
benevolence
of
its
objects
in
whatever
point
of
view
we
behold
it
whether
as
a
medium
for
giving
the
utmost
facility
to
the
despatch
of
the
common
concerns
of
life
or
as
affording
the
eager
mind
of
the
philosophic
inquirer
the
ready
means
to
gratify
the
inquisitive
thirst
of
his
knowledge
in
every
species
of
mental
intelligence
the
rapid
facility
which
it
affords
to
the
multiplication
of
those
mediums
of
communication
by
which
knowledge
is
promulgated
in
every
part
of
the
earth
we
are
at
a
loss
for
a
term
sufficiently
comprehensive
to
express
our
sense
of
the
infinite
importance
of
those
advantages
which
accrue
to
mankind
from
the
invention
of
an
art
so
replete
with
important
consequences
which
we
hourly
perceive
to
emanate
from
typography
we
need
therefore
scarcely
offer
an
apology
for
inserting
a
brief
history
of
this
divine
art
in
our
pages
the
earliest
specimens
of
printing
which
have
been
discovered
consist
in
the
stamped
marks
on
the
bricks
and
tiles
used
in
building
the
tower
and
city
of
babel
and
which
may
be
dated
as
far
back
as
two
thousand
two
hundred
years
before
christ
a
number
of
these
stamped
clay
materials
of
babel
are
still
preserved
in
antiquarian
repositories
it
is
remarkable
that
they
generally
differ
in
shape
and
appearance
and
that
the
letters
or
words
which
are
in
ancient
character
seem
to
have
been
stamped
by
the
hand
with
moveable
blocks
in
trinity
college
cambridge
some
curious
specimens
are
preserved
one
of
which
is
a
round
piece
of
clay
seven
inches
in
height
and
three
in
thickness
at
the
end
resembling
a
barrel
being
thickest
at
the
middle
this
interesting
relic
this
chaldean
book
is
entirely
covered
with
lines
of
letters
and
words
running
from
the
one
end
to
the
other
from
its
portable
character
it
may
be
called
a
and
one
which
can
not
be
less
than
four
thousand
years
old
it
is
mounted
on
a
marble
pedestal
covered
with
a
glass
case
secured
by
an
iron
bracket
and
so
contrived
that
the
curious
inspector
may
cause
it
to
revolve
on
its
marble
base
but
the
greatest
care
is
taken
of
this
valuable
relic
of
antiquity
it
appears
to
have
been
printed
by
two
moulds
and
at
the
middle
of
the
circumference
a
small
blank
square
has
been
left
in
case
as
it
is
supposed
room
should
be
required
for
a
portion
of
the
clay
to
escape
in
the
action
of
compression
next
to
these
extremely
ancient
stamped
bricks
in
point
of
interest
and
antiquity
are
specimens
of
the
earliest
engraving
of
letters
on
stone
we
are
informed
by
various
historical
writers
that
cadmus
a
phœnician
who
lived
one
thousand
five
hundred
years
before
christ
at
a
period
contemporary
with
moses
and
who
was
esteemed
as
the
builder
of
the
city
of
thebes
was
the
first
who
taught
the
greeks
the
use
of
alphabetic
symbols
an
art
he
most
likely
acquired
from
the
hebrews
the
most
ancient
specimen
of
an
engraved
inscription
now
known
to
be
extant
is
the
sigean
inscription
so
called
from
having
been
disinterred
upon
a
promontory
named
sigeum
situate
near
the
ancient
city
of
troy
in
phrygia
it
is
engraved
on
a
pillar
of
beautifully
white
marble
nine
feet
high
two
feet
broad
and
eight
inches
thick
and
which
from
the
inscription
served
as
the
pedestal
of
the
heathen
god
hermocrates
the
letters
used
in
this
inscription
are
the
capitals
of
the
grecian
language
though
rudely
cut
but
read
from
right
to
left
like
the
hebrew
this
specimen
of
engraving
must
be
about
three
thousand
years
old
another
not
less
interesting
relic
of
the
earliest
age
of
printing
is
found
in
a
roman
signet
ring
or
stamp
approaching
in
character
to
that
species
of
stamp
now
used
by
the
on
letters
this
curiosity
is
preserved
in
the
british
museum
it
is
the
very
earliest
specimen
we
possess
of
printing
by
means
of
ink
or
any
similar
substance
it
is
made
of
metal
a
sort
of
roman
brass
the
ground
of
which
is
covered
with
a
green
kind
of
verdigris
rust
with
which
antique
medals
are
usually
covered
the
letters
rise
flush
up
to
the
elevation
of
the
exterior
rim
which
surrounds
it
its
dimensions
are
about
two
inches
long
by
one
inch
broad
at
the
back
of
it
is
a
small
ring
for
the
finger
to
promote
the
convenience
of
holding
it
as
no
person
of
the
name
which
is
inscribed
upon
it
is
mentioned
in
roman
history
he
is
therefore
supposed
to
have
been
a
functionary
of
some
roman
officer
or
private
steward
and
who
perhaps
used
this
stamp
to
save
himself
the
trouble
of
writing
his
name
a
stamp
somewhat
similar
in
the
greek
character
is
in
the
possession
of
the
antiquarian
society
of
it
will
be
perceived
that
however
curious
these
relics
of
antiquity
may
be
they
do
not
bear
any
connection
with
the
art
of
printing
books
the
origin
of
this
invention
seems
to
be
quite
independent
of
a
preceding
knowledge
of
impressing
by
means
of
stamps
what
is
however
worthy
of
remark
the
art
of
printing
books
though
on
a
rude
principle
was
known
and
in
use
among
the
chinese
at
least
one
thousand
four
hundred
years
before
it
was
invented
in
europe
the
printing
of
the
chinese
has
never
resembled
anything
of
the
kind
in
this
country
from
the
first
it
has
been
conducted
without
moveable
types
each
page
has
been
and
continues
to
be
a
block
or
cut
stamp
which
is
thus
useful
for
only
one
subject
so
that
every
book
must
have
its
own
blocks
no
press
is
used
the
paper
being
thin
when
laid
on
the
block
receives
the
impression
by
being
smoothed
over
with
a
brush
there
is
reason
to
infer
that
the
art
of
printing
as
thus
practised
by
the
chinese
may
have
originated
through
a
knowledge
of
the
still
more
ancient
chaldean
mode
of
printing
by
blocks
on
clay
but
we
may
expect
from
the
ingenuity
of
the
chinese
and
their
in
general
having
the
organ
of
imitation
so
fully
developed
that
they
will
not
much
longer
continue
this
primitive
method
of
printing
as
an
enterprising
practical
printer
has
emigrated
with
an
excellent
assortment
of
presses
types
from
edinburgh
to
conduct
his
business
in
the
celestial
empire
we
wish
him
all
success
the
discovery
of
the
art
of
printing
with
moveable
types
which
took
place
in
the
fifteenth
century
in
germany
was
considerably
aided
by
a
fashion
which
had
been
some
time
prevalent
of
cutting
blocks
of
wood
into
pictures
or
representations
of
scenes
illustrative
of
scriptural
history
and
printing
them
on
paper
simply
by
the
pressure
of
the
hand
a
brush
or
cushion
behind
one
of
the
earliest
of
these
is
still
extant
and
represents
the
creation
of
man
as
detailed
in
the
book
of
genesis
in
the
centre
of
the
picture
stands
a
figure
intended
for
the
divinity
having
the
appearance
of
an
old
man
with
flowing
garments
a
venerable
beard
and
rays
proceeding
from
the
head
on
the
ground
before
him
lies
a
human
being
intended
for
adam
fast
asleep
and
from
an
opening
in
his
side
is
seen
proceeding
the
slender
figure
of
a
female
meaning
eve
who
is
taken
by
the
hand
by
god
and
is
apparently
receiving
his
blessing
the
execution
of
this
and
cuts
of
a
similar
nature
is
of
the
rudest
description
and
is
a
striking
testimony
of
the
low
scale
of
art
at
the
time
pictures
of
this
nature
which
were
bound
up
into
books
nevertheless
were
the
immediate
forerunners
of
the
great
invention
itself
books
of
prints
it
will
naturally
be
imagined
would
soon
be
found
imperfect
for
want
of
descriptive
text
this
therefore
urged
on
the
great
discovery
the
manufacturers
of
the
books
at
first
cut
single
sentences
or
words
and
stamped
them
below
the
pictures
but
this
not
conveying
a
sufficient
idea
of
the
subject
represented
an
anxiety
arose
to
give
a
lengthened
description
on
the
opposite
pages
this
it
seems
was
at
length
accomplished
still
the
sentences
were
all
cut
in
a
piece
and
the
notion
of
having
separate
letters
so
as
to
form
words
at
pleasure
was
unknown
at
that
period
we
will
now
proceed
to
the
introduction
of
the
modern
art
of
printing
ever
since
the
typographic
art
has
been
introduced
into
modern
europe
in
its
present
form
the
best
and
one
of
the
most
certain
criterions
which
prove
the
undoubted
sense
of
our
species
exists
in
the
multiplicity
of
claims
which
have
been
made
by
several
cities
for
the
honour
of
affording
the
earliest
shelter
to
the
infancy
of
this
art
it
really
appears
to
be
a
question
yet
undecided
to
what
city
individual
or
even
era
to
attribute
this
beneficial
invention
however
there
is
every
reason
to
believe
that
in
this
art
as
well
as
in
most
others
the
improvements
which
have
subsequently
taken
place
have
benefited
the
art
itself
as
much
as
that
has
benefited
mankind
therefore
the
question
of
its
origin
does
not
appear
to
us
to
be
of
so
much
importance
amidst
the
claims
of
various
individuals
bouzer
in
his
of
printing
says
that
this
honour
ought
to
be
adjudged
to
one
of
the
three
cities
of
haerlem
mentz
or
strasburg
of
which
in
his
opinion
the
first
named
city
has
best
established
her
legitimate
right
it
appears
to
use
his
own
words
all
those
cities
in
a
qualified
sense
may
claim
it
considering
the
improvements
they
have
made
upon
each
the
real
and
original
inventor
of
the
modern
art
of
printing
as
at
first
used
and
from
whence
the
improved
practice
is
descended
was
one
laurentius
of
haerlem
who
however
proceeded
no
further
than
to
cut
separate
wooden
letters
there
is
every
reason
to
believe
that
at
first
these
wooden
forms
were
made
upon
the
principle
of
the
of
the
romans
this
laurentius
it
appears
made
his
first
essay
about
the
year
he
died
ten
years
afterwards
having
first
printed
the
the
belgicum
and
two
editions
of
the
individual
on
whom
history
most
generally
places
the
honour
of
being
the
earliest
discoverer
of
the
art
of
printing
by
means
of
moveable
letters
or
types
was
john
guttenberg
a
citizen
of
mayence
or
mentz
who
flourished
from
the
year
to
in
the
reign
of
frederick
iii
of
germany
the
ingenious
guttenburg
was
born
at
mayence
in
the
beginning
of
the
fifteenth
century
and
removed
to
strasburg
about
the
year
or
perhaps
rather
earlier
here
he
became
acquainted
with
the
laurentius
with
whom
he
proceeded
to
haerlem
and
continued
in
the
employment
of
laurentius
for
some
time
however
he
returned
to
strasburg
where
in
he
entered
into
partnership
with
andrew
dritzehan
john
riff
and
andrew
heelman
citizens
of
strasburg
binding
himself
to
disclose
to
them
some
important
secrets
by
which
they
would
make
their
fortunes
the
workshop
was
in
the
house
of
dritzehan
who
dying
guttenberg
immediately
sent
his
servant
lawrence
beildick
to
nicholas
the
brother
of
the
deceased
and
requested
that
no
person
might
be
admitted
into
the
workshop
lest
the
secret
should
be
discovered
and
the
stolen
but
they
had
already
disappeared
and
this
fraud
as
well
as
the
claims
of
nicholas
dritzehan
to
succeed
to
his
share
produced
a
among
the
surviving
partners
five
witnesses
were
examined
and
from
the
evidence
of
servants
it
was
incontrovertibly
proved
that
guttenberg
was
the
first
that
practised
the
art
of
printing
with
moveable
types
in
strasburg
and
that
on
the
death
of
andrew
dritzehan
he
had
expressly
ordered
the
forms
to
be
broken
up
and
the
types
dispersed
lest
any
one
should
discover
his
secret
the
words
given
in
his
order
which
were
supported
by
documentary
evidence
were
these
take
the
component
parts
of
the
press
and
pull
them
to
pieces
then
no
one
will
understand
what
they
in
the
same
document
mention
is
made
of
kept
together
by
or
and
of
letters
and
pages
being
cut
up
and
destroyed
it
has
been
asserted
that
guttenberg
stole
the
types
from
laurentius
with
which
he
repaired
to
strasburg
and
commenced
business
but
of
this
we
can
find
no
corroboration
it
has
also
been
said
that
upon
this
occasion
guttenberg
stole
his
own
materials
but
this
is
likewise
unauthenticated
the
result
of
this
which
occurred
in
was
a
dissolution
of
partnership
and
guttenberg
after
having
exhausted
his
means
in
the
effort
proceeded
in
to
his
native
city
of
mentz
where
he
resumed
his
typographic
labours
being
ambitious
of
making
his
extraordinary
invention
known
and
of
value
to
himself
but
being
at
the
same
time
deficient
in
the
means
he
opened
his
mind
to
a
wealthy
goldsmith
and
worker
in
precious
metals
named
john
fust
or
faust
and
prevailed
on
him
to
advance
large
sums
of
money
in
order
to
make
further
and
more
complete
trials
of
the
art
guttenberg
being
thus
associated
with
faust
the
first
regular
printing
office
was
begun
and
the
business
carried
on
in
a
style
corresponding
to
the
infancy
of
the
art
after
many
smaller
essays
in
trying
the
capabilities
of
a
press
and
moveable
types
guttenberg
had
the
hardihood
to
attempt
an
edition
of
the
bible
which
he
succeeded
in
printing
complete
between
the
years
and
this
celebrated
bible
which
was
the
first
important
specimen
of
the
art
of
printing
and
which
judging
from
what
it
has
led
to
we
should
certainly
esteem
as
the
most
extraordinary
and
praiseworthy
of
human
productions
was
executed
with
cut
metal
types
on
six
hundred
and
leaves
and
from
a
copy
still
in
existence
in
the
royal
library
of
berlin
some
appear
to
have
been
printed
on
vellum
the
work
was
printed
in
the
latin
language
the
execution
of
this
the
first
printed
bible
which
has
justly
conferred
undying
honours
on
the
illustrious
guttenberg
was
most
unfortunately
the
immediate
cause
of
his
ruin
the
expenses
incident
to
carrying
on
a
fatiguing
and
elaborate
process
of
workmanship
for
a
period
of
five
years
being
much
more
considerable
than
what
were
originally
contemplated
by
faust
he
instituted
a
suit
against
poor
guttenberg
who
in
consequence
of
the
decision
against
him
was
obliged
to
pay
interest
and
also
a
part
of
the
capital
that
had
been
advanced
this
suit
was
followed
by
a
dissolution
of
partnership
and
the
whole
of
materials
fell
into
the
hands
of
john
faust
besides
the
bible
some
other
specimens
of
the
work
of
guttenberg
have
been
discovered
to
be
in
existence
one
in
particular
which
is
worthy
of
notice
was
found
some
years
ago
among
a
bundle
of
old
papers
in
the
archives
of
mayence
it
is
an
almanack
for
the
year
which
served
as
a
cover
for
a
register
of
accounts
for
that
year
this
would
most
likely
be
printed
towards
the
close
of
the
year
and
may
consequently
be
deemed
the
most
ancient
specimen
of
typographic
printing
extant
with
a
certain
date
antiquaries
and
bibliomaniacs
have
found
considerable
difficulty
in
ascertaining
by
what
process
guttenberg
manufactured
types
but
it
appears
to
be
the
prevalent
opinion
that
those
which
he
first
used
were
individually
cut
by
the
hand
and
being
all
made
as
near
a
height
and
thickness
as
possible
they
were
thus
put
together
in
the
forms
the
cutting
of
these
types
must
have
been
a
tedious
as
well
as
laborious
occupation
this
ingenious
man
however
soon
discovered
the
mode
of
casting
his
types
by
means
of
moulds
for
without
this
great
accessory
to
the
art
of
printing
he
conceived
it
was
next
to
impossible
to
carry
on
his
business
the
art
of
is
therefore
given
to
john
guttenberg
in
which
it
would
appear
he
has
had
no
competitor
for
the
honour
but
it
is
but
justice
to
state
that
the
plan
of
striking
the
moulds
with
punches
was
a
subsequent
invention
of
peter
schoeffer
his
successor
who
became
partner
with
faust
and
afterwards
his
that
guttenberg
was
a
person
of
refined
taste
in
the
execution
of
his
works
is
sufficiently
obvious
to
every
person
who
has
had
the
opportunity
of
seeing
any
of
them
adopting
a
very
ancient
custom
common
in
the
written
copies
of
the
scriptures
and
the
missals
of
the
church
he
used
a
large
ornamental
letter
at
the
commencement
of
books
and
chapters
finely
embellished
and
surrounded
with
a
variety
of
figures
as
in
a
frame
the
initial
letter
of
the
first
psalm
thus
forms
a
splendid
specimen
of
the
art
of
printing
in
its
early
progress
it
is
richly
ornamented
with
foliage
flowers
a
bird
and
a
greyhound
and
is
still
more
beautiful
from
being
printed
in
a
pale
blue
colour
while
the
embellishments
are
red
and
of
a
transparent
appearance
what
became
of
guttenberg
immediately
after
the
unsuccessful
termination
of
his
with
faust
is
not
well
known
like
the
illustrious
discoverer
of
the
great
western
continent
he
seems
to
have
retired
almost
from
the
service
of
an
ungrateful
world
and
to
have
spent
most
of
the
remainder
of
his
days
in
obscurity
it
is
ascertained
however
that
in
he
received
an
annual
pension
from
the
elector
adolphus
but
that
he
only
enjoyed
this
trifling
compensation
for
his
extraordinary
invention
for
a
period
of
three
years
and
died
in
february
john
faust
who
as
we
have
seen
obtained
the
materials
of
guttenberg
laid
claim
to
the
invention
which
has
been
granted
to
him
by
several
having
sufficient
capital
at
his
command
he
pushed
the
trade
with
great
advantage
to
himself
in
the
bibles
which
he
printed
he
frequently
omitted
the
capital
and
initial
letters
leaving
them
blank
for
illumination
in
gold
or
azure
this
was
designedly
done
for
the
purpose
of
imposing
upon
the
public
printed
copies
for
transcripts
the
report
which
is
in
circulation
concerning
faust
appears
to
come
in
support
of
this
assertion
it
being
said
he
was
at
paris
and
offering
a
quantity
of
his
bibles
for
sale
as
the
french
considering
the
number
of
them
and
also
remarking
the
exact
similarity
and
accuracy
of
them
even
to
a
single
point
concluded
it
was
impossible
for
the
most
accurate
copyist
to
have
transcribed
them
so
correctly
they
suspected
him
of
necromancy
and
either
actually
indicted
him
or
threatened
to
do
as
a
magician
and
by
this
means
obtained
his
secret
whence
came
the
origin
of
the
popular
story
of
faustus
his
dealing
with
the
devil
and
tragical
death
in
when
mentz
was
plundered
and
disfranchised
of
its
former
liberties
printing
rapidly
spread
through
a
great
part
of
europe
particularly
its
artizans
in
that
branch
of
art
settled
at
haerlem
hamburgh
and
other
places
from
haerlem
it
travelled
to
rome
in
when
the
roman
character
was
adopted
in
and
soon
perfected
in
the
reign
of
henry
the
archbishop
of
canterbury
sent
turnour
master
of
the
robes
and
caxton
merchant
to
haerlem
to
learn
the
art
these
individuals
privately
prevailed
upon
one
corselis
an
under
workman
to
come
to
england
and
a
printing
press
was
established
at
oxford
this
appears
in
a
chronicle
still
preserved
it
informs
us
that
the
execution
of
the
concern
entrusted
to
turnour
and
caxton
cost
marks
and
that
printing
was
established
at
oxford
before
there
was
any
printer
or
printing
presses
in
france
italy
or
spain
the
university
of
oxford
press
was
soon
discovered
to
be
too
remote
from
the
seat
of
government
and
too
great
a
distance
from
the
sea
other
presses
were
speedily
established
at
and
the
abbey
of
westminster
in
printing
was
established
at
tours
at
reuthlingen
and
venice
in
and
it
is
likely
at
the
same
period
at
paris
where
several
of
the
german
printers
were
invited
by
the
doctors
of
the
sorbonne
who
established
a
press
in
that
city
all
important
as
the
art
of
printing
is
acknowledged
to
be
yet
three
centuries
elapsed
from
the
date
of
the
invention
before
it
was
perfected
in
many
of
its
most
necessary
details
at
first
the
art
was
kept
entirely
in
the
hands
of
learned
men
the
greatest
scholars
often
glorying
in
affixing
their
names
to
the
works
as
correctors
of
the
press
and
giving
names
to
the
various
parts
of
the
mechanism
of
the
as
is
testified
by
the
classical
technicalities
still
in
use
among
the
workmen
from
the
great
improvement
of
punching
moulds
for
casting
types
by
schoeffer
as
formerly
mentioned
till
the
invention
of
italic
letters
by
aldus
manutius
to
whom
learning
is
much
indebted
no
other
improvement
of
any
consequence
took
place
it
does
not
appear
that
mechanical
ingenuity
was
at
any
time
directed
to
the
improvement
of
the
presses
or
any
other
part
of
the
machinery
used
in
printing
and
the
consequence
was
that
till
far
on
in
the
eighteenth
century
the
clumsy
presses
which
were
composed
of
wood
and
iron
and
slow
and
heavy
in
working
were
allowed
to
screech
on
as
they
had
done
since
the
days
of
guttenberg
faust
and
caxton
while
the
ink
continued
to
be
applied
by
means
of
two
stuffed
balls
at
a
great
expense
of
time
and
labour
at
length
an
almost
entire
revolution
was
effected
in
the
printing
office
both
in
the
appearance
of
the
workmanship
and
the
mechanism
of
the
presses
about
the
same
period
the
art
of
stereotyping
was
discovered
and
developed
a
completely
new
feature
in
the
history
of
printing
one
of
the
chief
improvements
in
typography
was
the
discarding
of
the
long
s
and
every
description
of
contraction
while
at
the
same
time
the
formation
of
the
letters
was
executed
with
more
neatness
and
greater
regularity
among
the
first
improvers
of
the
printing
press
the
most
honourable
place
is
due
to
the
earl
of
stanhope
a
nobleman
who
will
be
long
remembered
for
his
mechanical
genius
besides
applying
certain
lever
powers
to
the
screw
and
handle
of
the
old
wooden
press
by
which
the
labour
of
the
workman
was
diminished
and
finer
work
effected
he
constructed
a
press
wholly
of
iron
which
is
known
by
his
name
since
the
beginning
of
the
present
century
and
more
especially
within
the
last
thirty
years
presses
wholly
of
iron
on
the
nicest
scientific
principles
have
been
invented
by
men
of
mechanical
genius
so
as
to
simplify
the
process
of
printing
in
an
extraordinary
degree
and
the
invention
of
presses
composed
of
cylinders
and
wrought
by
steam
has
triumphantly
crowned
the
improvements
in
this
art
the
alteration
effected
by
steam
power
has
been
as
great
in
the
printing
business
as
in
any
branch
whatever
for
example
with
the
old
wooden
press
it
took
a
man
two
days
to
complete
sheets
that
is
printed
on
both
sides
whereas
the
london
by
means
of
the
steam
press
completes
in
one
hour
almost
every
newspaper
in
the
kingdom
is
printed
by
although
some
are
worked
by
hand
instead
of
steam
they
are
also
used
in
other
departments
of
the
printing
business
the
introduction
of
would
have
been
of
comparatively
little
benefit
if
it
had
not
been
furthered
by
another
invention
of
a
very
simple
nature
now
of
great
value
to
the
printer
we
here
allude
to
the
invention
of
the
roller
for
applying
the
ink
instead
of
the
old
clumsy
and
inefficient
balls
the
roller
which
is
simply
a
composition
of
glue
and
treacle
cast
upon
wooden
was
invented
by
a
journeyman
printer
from
edinburgh
about
thirty
years
ago
and
was
so
much
appreciated
by
the
trade
as
at
once
to
spread
over
the
whole
of
europe
were
it
possible
to
conjure
up
the
spirits
of
the
illustrious
guttenburg
and
his
contemporaries
within
the
office
of
the
london
or
some
other
large
where
everything
is
conducted
with
rapidity
quietness
and
order
john
faust
might
well
think
that
the
printers
of
the
nineteenth
century
had
actually
consummated
what
he
was
only
accused
of
in
the
fifteenth
completed
a
compact
with
the
devil
as
it
would
be
a
waste
of
time
for
us
to
pretend
to
describe
the
various
processes
and
materials
required
in
this
beautiful
art
as
we
are
aware
that
without
actual
observation
no
conception
can
be
formed
this
we
know
from
experience
and
though
we
might
like
many
others
have
pretended
to
give
a
description
we
are
perfectly
aware
that
we
would
have
been
unintelligible
to
the
majority
of
our
readers
and
very
deservedly
laughed
at
for
our
trouble
by
any
practical
printer
who
might
happen
to
read
our
pages
as
far
as
we
have
gone
however
in
giving
a
brief
historical
account
of
the
art
of
printing
we
have
no
doubt
it
will
be
found
correct
as
have
consulted
the
best
authorities
stereotype
stereotype
as
we
have
mentioned
in
the
former
article
was
introduced
about
the
middle
of
last
century
and
as
it
is
so
intimately
connected
with
the
art
of
printing
we
could
not
find
a
more
appropriate
place
than
immediately
following
that
noble
earl
stanhope
has
been
named
as
the
inventor
but
for
this
we
have
not
sufficient
authority
and
it
appears
extremely
doubtful
as
stereotyping
appears
to
have
been
invented
simultaneously
in
various
parts
of
england
and
scotland
by
different
persons
still
it
was
upwards
of
sixty
years
before
it
was
brought
to
such
perfection
as
to
be
applicable
for
any
beneficial
purpose
when
properly
made
known
it
was
hailed
with
approbation
by
those
more
immediately
interested
the
printers
and
publishers
but
as
experience
more
fully
developed
its
powers
it
was
found
available
only
for
particular
work
for
the
better
understanding
of
this
art
which
is
comparatively
little
known
we
will
give
a
description
of
the
process
which
we
are
enabled
to
do
by
the
assistance
of
an
experienced
workman
in
the
types
they
are
lifted
from
the
case
one
by
one
with
the
right
hand
and
built
in
a
small
iron
form
called
a
held
in
the
left
hand
of
the
compositor
who
sets
line
after
line
till
the
stick
is
filled
when
he
empties
it
upon
a
and
commences
again
in
the
same
manner
till
he
has
got
as
much
up
as
will
make
a
page
this
page
he
ties
firmly
up
and
places
upon
a
smooth
stone
or
cast
iron
table
in
this
manner
he
continues
till
he
gets
as
many
pages
as
will
make
a
which
consists
of
or
more
pages
as
the
case
may
be
if
this
form
is
to
be
worked
off
at
press
without
stereotyping
the
pages
are
all
imposed
in
one
and
carried
to
press
for
working
and
when
the
whole
of
the
impression
is
off
it
is
thoroughly
washed
and
carried
back
to
the
compositor
for
distribution
that
is
putting
the
types
in
their
proper
places
when
these
pages
are
to
be
stereotyped
they
are
separately
and
carried
to
the
stereotype
foundry
where
they
are
examined
and
all
dirt
taken
from
the
face
they
are
then
slightly
oiled
and
a
put
round
each
the
frame
is
filled
with
liquid
plaster
of
paris
which
is
well
rubbed
into
the
face
of
the
type
to
expel
the
air
as
soon
as
this
plaster
hardens
it
is
removed
from
the
page
and
shows
a
complete
resemblance
of
the
page
from
which
it
is
taken
the
mould
is
put
into
an
oven
to
dry
where
it
remains
till
it
resembles
a
piece
of
pottery
it
is
then
put
into
an
iron
pan
in
which
there
is
a
thin
plate
of
the
same
metal
called
the
it
has
also
an
iron
lid
which
is
firmly
screwed
down
and
the
whole
is
immersed
in
a
pot
of
molten
which
fills
the
pan
by
means
of
small
holes
in
the
corners
of
the
lid
the
length
of
time
it
remains
in
the
pot
depends
upon
the
heat
of
the
metal
but
it
is
generally
from
ten
to
fifteen
minutes
when
it
is
taken
out
and
put
aside
to
cool
on
opening
the
pan
nothing
is
seen
but
a
solid
lump
of
metal
which
when
carefully
broke
round
the
mould
a
thin
plate
is
obtained
from
the
mass
exhibiting
a
perfect
appearance
of
the
page
from
which
the
mould
was
this
is
called
a
stereotype
plate
which
in
general
is
not
above
the
eighth
of
an
inch
thick
and
is
printed
from
in
the
same
manner
as
a
page
of
types
such
is
the
process
of
stereotyping
which
has
become
pretty
general
throughout
the
trade
but
is
not
much
known
to
the
public
engraving
on
wood
as
we
have
shown
in
our
article
on
printing
was
in
fashion
prior
to
the
invention
of
printing
we
are
informed
by
albert
durer
that
engraving
on
wood
was
invented
about
the
year
he
may
be
a
good
authority
in
some
matters
but
in
this
he
has
committed
a
mistake
of
nearly
one
hundred
years
seeing
that
there
is
at
least
an
impression
of
one
engraving
on
wood
the
representation
of
the
creation
which
was
in
existence
prior
to
it
was
undoubtedly
a
piece
of
rough
workmanship
but
what
could
be
expected
at
that
early
period
of
the
art
it
has
been
however
gradually
improving
ever
since
and
it
has
now
attained
a
point
of
excellence
equal
to
any
of
the
fine
arts
and
calls
forth
the
admiration
of
every
lover
of
the
beautiful
it
would
be
invidious
to
select
any
of
the
numerous
artists
now
flourishing
perhaps
it
would
be
difficult
to
make
a
selection
where
so
many
are
upon
an
equality
and
we
are
of
opinion
they
themselves
are
more
willing
to
accept
the
public
approbation
as
their
reward
than
any
praise
our
pen
could
bestow
all
we
can
do
is
to
recommend
our
readers
to
examine
for
themselves
they
have
abundant
opportunities
in
the
numerous
illustrated
publications
that
are
daily
issued
from
the
press
and
bestow
that
meed
of
praise
upon
the
respective
artists
they
may
deem
proper
the
process
of
engraving
on
is
diametrically
distinct
and
opposite
to
that
of
engraving
on
or
as
in
the
former
the
shades
are
produced
by
the
parts
of
the
work
which
are
made
most
prominent
and
obtrude
upon
the
surface
of
the
substance
whence
its
chief
merit
has
been
regarded
in
leaving
broad
and
lights
the
parts
to
produce
this
effect
being
of
necessity
excavated
great
art
and
a
masterly
judgment
are
necessary
to
effect
this
and
at
the
same
time
not
to
weaken
the
substance
lest
it
should
be
injured
in
the
pressure
necessary
to
produce
an
impression
the
substance
usually
employed
for
these
engravings
is
wood
of
a
close
grain
on
this
account
is
generally
selected
the
impressions
are
obtained
from
upon
exactly
the
same
principle
as
are
the
impressions
from
typography
and
they
can
also
be
worked
off
at
the
same
time
with
the
descriptive
text
this
is
a
superiority
which
wood
possesses
over
other
engravings
and
recommends
itself
to
publishers
on
account
of
the
immense
saving
in
the
expense
of
a
double
process
in
procuring
illustrations
for
typographical
works
and
enables
them
to
keep
pace
with
the
ruling
passion
of
this
literary
era
cheap
publications
on
copper
the
art
of
engraving
on
copper
plates
for
impressions
is
alleged
to
have
been
invented
by
peter
schoeffer
one
of
the
early
printers
and
son
of
john
faust
about
the
year
the
honour
of
this
invention
is
also
claimed
by
a
florentine
goldsmith
of
the
name
of
finguires
who
dates
his
invention
in
this
artist
having
used
liquid
sulphur
to
take
an
impression
of
some
chasing
and
engraving
he
had
made
observed
a
blackness
produced
by
the
sulphur
left
in
the
deepest
parts
of
his
work
whence
he
obtained
an
impression
on
paper
but
we
have
no
hesitation
in
giving
the
preference
to
schoeffer
who
we
have
previously
remarked
was
of
an
ingenious
turn
and
assisted
guttenburg
in
producing
moulds
for
casting
his
types
in
addition
to
which
some
of
the
books
printed
by
him
are
ornamented
with
head
and
with
other
rude
attempts
at
engraving
and
likewise
because
claim
to
the
honour
was
acknowledged
before
finguires
was
born
of
engraving
there
are
various
kinds
that
called
by
connoisseurs
the
legitimate
mode
of
engraving
is
what
is
termed
the
or
mode
numerous
have
been
the
british
artists
who
have
excelled
in
this
style
in
affording
the
means
of
multiplying
our
graphical
productions
the
next
species
of
engraving
we
will
notice
is
called
the
or
chalk
style
imitations
of
chalk
drawings
portraits
and
historical
pieces
are
executed
in
this
style
which
the
celebrated
bartolozzi
brought
to
perfection
the
third
species
we
will
mention
can
not
properly
be
called
engraving
the
effect
is
produced
by
scraping
and
rubbing
this
kind
is
called
or
mezzotinto
producing
prints
which
have
the
effect
of
indian
ink
drawings
a
fourth
species
of
engraving
is
what
is
commonly
used
for
landscapes
which
produces
an
effect
like
a
pencil
drawing
which
is
called
in
all
of
these
kinds
of
engravings
upon
copper
the
artists
find
the
sulphuric
acid
or
aquafortis
a
most
powerful
agent
sometimes
indeed
it
is
suffered
to
execute
the
whole
of
the
process
of
the
graver
especially
when
it
is
called
an
etching
for
the
same
reasons
as
those
mentioned
with
regard
to
wood
engravers
we
shall
abstain
from
naming
any
of
the
very
eminent
artists
now
living
we
have
already
observed
the
mode
of
obtaining
similar
effects
from
wood
and
copper
are
opposite
to
each
other
the
manner
in
which
impressions
from
wood
engravings
are
obtained
has
likewise
been
noticed
and
it
remains
that
we
observe
the
mode
by
which
impressions
are
obtained
from
the
plate
is
covered
with
appropriate
ink
the
surface
is
then
carefully
cleansed
leaving
ink
only
in
the
excavations
or
lines
in
the
copper
the
plate
and
paper
are
passed
through
a
roller
press
of
great
power
the
roller
being
covered
with
a
blanket
which
presses
the
paper
into
all
the
crevices
of
the
plate
and
brings
away
the
ink
there
deposited
on
steel
for
several
years
steel
has
been
used
in
great
quantities
instead
of
by
engravers
by
this
fortunate
application
of
so
durable
and
it
may
be
added
so
economical
a
material
not
only
has
a
new
field
been
discovered
admirably
suited
to
yield
in
perfection
the
richest
and
finest
graphic
productions
which
the
ingenuity
of
modern
art
can
accomplish
but
to
do
so
through
an
amazingly
numerous
series
of
impressions
without
perceptible
deterioration
the
art
of
engraving
on
iron
or
steel
for
purposes
of
ornament
and
even
for
printing
in
certain
cases
is
by
no
means
a
discovery
of
modern
times
but
the
substitution
of
the
latter
for
copper
which
has
invited
the
superiority
of
the
british
burin
to
achievements
hitherto
unattempted
by
our
artists
is
entirely
a
modern
practice
in
the
year
dyer
an
american
merchant
residing
in
london
obtained
a
patent
for
certain
improvements
in
the
construction
and
method
of
using
plates
and
presses
the
principles
of
which
were
communicated
to
him
by
a
foreigner
residing
abroad
this
foreigner
was
jacob
perkin
an
ingenious
artist
of
new
england
and
whose
name
has
become
subsequently
so
extensively
known
in
this
country
in
connection
with
printing
from
hardened
steel
plates
the
plates
used
by
perkins
were
on
the
average
about
of
an
inch
thick
they
were
either
of
steel
so
tempered
as
to
admit
of
the
operation
of
the
engraver
or
as
was
more
generally
the
case
of
steel
decarbonated
so
as
to
become
very
pure
soft
iron
in
which
case
after
they
had
received
the
work
on
the
surface
they
were
case
hardened
by
cementation
the
decarbonating
process
was
performed
by
enclosing
the
plate
of
cast
steel
properly
shaped
in
a
cast
iron
box
or
case
filled
about
the
plate
to
the
thickness
of
about
an
inch
with
oxide
of
iron
or
rusty
iron
filings
in
this
state
the
box
is
luted
close
and
placed
on
a
regular
fire
where
it
is
kept
at
a
red
heat
during
from
three
to
twelve
days
generally
about
nine
days
is
sufficient
to
decarbonize
a
plate
of
an
inch
in
thickness
when
the
engraving
or
etching
has
been
executed
the
plate
is
superficially
converted
into
steel
by
placing
it
in
a
box
as
before
and
surrounding
it
on
all
sides
by
a
powder
made
of
equal
parts
of
burned
bones
and
the
cinders
of
burned
animal
matter
such
as
old
shoes
or
leather
in
this
state
the
box
with
its
contents
closely
luted
must
be
exposed
to
a
heat
for
three
hours
after
which
it
is
taken
out
of
the
fire
and
plunged
perpendicularly
edgeways
into
cold
water
which
has
been
previously
boiled
to
throw
off
the
air
by
this
means
the
plate
becomes
hardened
without
the
danger
of
warping
or
cracking
it
is
then
tempered
or
let
down
by
brightening
the
under
surface
of
the
plate
with
a
bit
of
stone
after
which
it
is
heated
by
being
placed
upon
a
piece
of
hot
iron
or
melted
lead
until
the
rubbed
portion
acquire
a
pale
for
this
purpose
however
the
patentee
expressed
himself
in
favour
of
a
bath
of
oil
heated
to
the
temperature
of
degrees
or
thereabouts
of
scale
the
plate
being
cooled
in
water
and
polished
on
the
surface
was
ready
for
use
a
more
material
peculiarity
in
invention
and
one
which
does
not
seem
to
have
been
approached
by
any
preceding
artist
was
the
contrivance
of
what
are
called
these
are
rollers
of
two
or
three
inches
in
diameter
and
made
of
steel
decarbonized
by
the
process
above
described
so
as
to
be
very
soft
in
this
state
they
are
made
to
roll
backward
and
forward
under
a
powerful
pressure
over
the
surface
of
one
of
the
hardened
plates
until
all
the
figures
letters
or
indentations
are
communicated
with
exquisite
precision
in
sharp
relief
upon
the
cylinder
which
being
carefully
hardened
and
tempered
becomes
by
this
means
fitted
to
communicate
an
impression
to
other
plates
by
an
operation
similar
to
that
by
which
it
was
originally
figured
it
will
be
obvious
that
one
advantage
gained
by
this
method
must
be
the
entire
saving
of
the
labour
and
expense
of
in
every
case
on
different
plates
ornaments
borders
emblematical
designs
as
these
can
now
be
impressed
with
little
trouble
on
any
number
of
plates
or
in
any
part
thereof
by
the
application
of
the
cylinder
at
first
sight
the
performance
of
such
an
operation
as
the
one
now
alluded
to
may
appear
difficult
if
not
impracticable
and
indeed
many
persons
on
its
first
announcement
were
disposed
to
doubt
or
deny
its
possibility
altogether
with
a
proper
and
powerful
apparatus
however
this
method
of
transferring
engravings
from
plates
to
cylinders
and
is
every
day
performed
with
facility
and
success
not
only
in
the
production
of
bank
notes
labels
but
in
works
exhibiting
very
elaborate

be
said
to
be
divided
naturally
into
two
parts
of
which
division
the
author
has
availed
himself
first
adducing
its
history
and
secondly
affording
the
operation
of
its
process
its
history
appears
to
have
arisen
with
its
origin
and
both
to
have
originated
in
the
necessities
of
the
author
from
whence
it
appears
that
after
he
had
received
a
scholastic
education
to
qualify
him
for
the
jurisprudence
of
his
country
the
death
of
his
father
who
was
a
votary
of
the
thespian
art
deprived
him
of
those
resources
essential
to
enable
him
to
pursue
his
intended
honourable
vocation
he
was
consequently
driven
to
seek
support
from
the
previous
acquisitions
of
his
mind
he
accordingly
devoted
his
earnest
attention
to
solicit
the
favours
of
the
dramatic
muse
as
an
author
after
encountering
numberless
difficulties
he
produced
one
play
which
was
published
and
sold
considerably
well
but
the
honourable
independence
of
his
mind
induced
him
to
reflect
upon
the
certainty
of
the
large
expense
which
necessarily
attends
the
practice
of
an
author
who
has
not
liberal
patrons
in
the
public
or
the
trade
and
the
uncertainty
of
adequate
remuneration
from
the
public
for
whose
amusement
they
make
such
large
sacrifices
of
time
ease
property
health
and
often
life
itself
these
reflections
induced
his
ardent
and
ingenious
mind
to
endeavour
to
avoid
the
uncertainty
of
this
contingency
he
did
not
possess
property
to
enable
him
to
establish
himself
as
a
printer
which
was
his
desire
he
was
therefore
compelled
to
have
recourse
to
his
own
ingenuity
he
tried
various
and
at
first
unsuccessful
experiments
which
he
ingeniously
details
because
he
considered
that
nearly
as
much
is
learned
from
the
failures
of
an
artist
had
he
always
the
honesty
to
publish
them
as
is
gained
from
his
most
successful
discoveries
various
were
the
materials
upon
which
he
first
essayed
to
complete
his
purposes
till
at
length
chance
directed
him
to
try
what
could
be
effected
upon
stone
for
this
purpose
he
used
a
species
found
in
germany
of
a
beautifully
close
grained
and
dense
kind
susceptible
of
receiving
a
fine
polish
called
kellheim
stone
knowing
the
failures
which
his
countrymen
had
experienced
in
endeavouring
to
fix
the
ink
in
this
stone
for
etching
he
had
recourse
to
a
chemical
experiment
to
obviate
this
which
succeeded
in
the
following
manner
to
four
or
five
parts
of
water
he
added
one
of
rectified
vitriol
which
instantly
produced
an
effervescence
on
being
poured
upon
it
the
stone
was
instantly
covered
with
a
coat
of
gypsum
which
to
vitriol
is
impenetrable
this
is
easily
wiped
off
and
the
stone
being
dried
it
is
ready
for
use
the
next
want
he
found
was
a
species
of
ink
proper
to
answer
the
peculiar
purposes
of
the
material
whereon
he
had
to
operate
for
which
he
discovered
none
so
well
adapted
as
the
following
mixture
a
composition
of
three
parts
of
wax
with
one
of
yellow
soap
is
melted
over
a
fire
and
mixed
with
a
small
portion
of
dissolved
in
but
this
is
now
greatly
simplified
as
the
lithographic
printers
generally
use
the
same
ink
as
the
copperplate
printers
the
process
of
lithography
is
very
simple
the
article
wanted
to
be
printed
is
written
or
drawn
upon
a
piece
of
transfer
paper
which
being
wet
and
laid
on
the
stone
and
put
through
the
press
the
writing
or
drawing
remains
on
the
stone
and
any
number
of
impressions
may
be
taken
off
care
must
be
taken
before
inking
to
come
over
the
stone
with
a
damp
sponge
to
prevent
the
ink
adhering
to
the
places
not
wanted
which
it
would
otherwise
do
we
understand
the
bath
and
portland
stone
is
successfully
used
but
the
best
yet
found
in
britain
for
the
purpose
is
what
is
known
by
the
name
of
raised
near
in
warwickshire
it
is
a
calcareous
and
partly
siliceous
stone
and
we
think
not
destitute
of
magnesia
having
when
polished
a
very
silky
and
somewhat
saponaceous
feel
this
art
has
flourished
to
a
greater
extent
than
we
believe
the
most
sanguine
expectations
of
its
inventor
could
have
anticipated
many
beautiful
specimens
of
art
have
been
produced
equal
to
the
finest
engravings
it
is
excellently
adapted
for
drawing
of
plans
circulars
cards
and
many
other
light
articles
which
used
formerly
to
be
printed
by
means
of
and
on
account
of
the
numerous
ornaments
so
easily
applied
to
the
lithographic
process
the
most
of
these
and
similar
articles
are
principally
lithographed
to
the
detriment
we
would
conceive
of
the
and
printers
paper
before
the
invention
of
paper
in
ancient
times
a
great
variety
of
substances
have
been
used
for
the
purpose
of
recording
events
or
delineating
ideas
of
which
it
becomes
our
duty
to
give
a
somewhat
detailed
account
to
show
our
readers
the
numerous
advantages
they
enjoy
in
having
a
material
which
like
everything
in
common
use
is
but
little
thought
of
but
let
any
one
suppose
himself
to
be
without
this
necessary
article
or
the
means
of
communicating
his
ideas
he
would
be
sensible
of
the
difference
rough
stones
and
stakes
were
used
as
the
first
known
records
of
the
ancient
phœnicians
remains
of
which
are
reported
to
be
still
visible
and
to
confirm
this
persuasion
certain
heaps
of
stones
have
been
discovered
in
the
environs
of
cadiz
which
are
currently
believed
to
be
the
remains
of
those
monuments
alleged
to
be
made
by
hercules
in
memory
of
his
famous
expedition
to
the
gardens
of
the
hesperides
for
the
golden
fruit
or
as
others
have
it
against
spain
it
is
also
stated
that
the
usual
mode
of
recording
great
events
in
the
north
of
asia
and
europe
was
by
placing
stones
of
extraordinary
size
in
aid
of
this
we
have
a
great
variety
of
instances
since
the
art
has
been
introduced
or
invented
many
materials
have
been
in
a
variety
of
ages
and
in
numerous
countries
used
for
the
purpose
of
recording
events
to
posterity
characters
cut
upon
rocks
upon
tables
of
stone
upon
bark
pieces
of
wood
written
upon
skins
of
fish
and
animals
besides
a
great
variety
of
other
articles
of
which
we
will
only
enumerate
a
few
there
is
a
bible
still
preserved
written
on
in
the
university
of
gottingen
containing
leaves
another
bible
of
the
same
material
is
at
copenhagen
there
was
also
in
sir
hans
collection
more
than
twenty
manuscripts
in
various
languages
on
the
same
material
the
protocols
of
the
emperors
in
early
times
were
written
upon
bark
in
the
british
museum
are
many
specimens
of
this
substance
also
in
the
grand
gallery
at
florence
to
this
mode
is
supposed
to
have
succeeded
the
practice
of
painting
letters
on
linen
cloth
and
cotton
what
was
the
difference
in
the
preparation
of
that
material
to
the
one
now
employed
is
not
ascertained
but
it
is
considered
that
some
preparation
was
necessary
in
order
to
use
that
substance
there
have
been
frequently
found
in
the
chests
or
cases
containing
the
egyptian
mummies
very
neat
characters
written
on
linen
linen
being
subject
to
accidents
from
becoming
mouldy
asbestoes
cloth
had
been
occasionally
used
in
small
quantities
the
accidents
to
which
these
species
of
materials
were
most
of
them
subject
and
linen
particularly
so
induced
man
to
endeavour
to
remedy
those
objects
he
accordingly
is
found
to
have
recourse
to
the
animal
creation
in
the
convent
of
dominican
monks
at
bologna
are
two
books
of
esdras
written
on
skins
said
to
have
been
written
by
esdras
himself
the
ancient
persians
wrote
on
hides
from
which
the
hair
was
scraped
the
shepherds
wrote
their
songs
with
thorns
upon
straps
of
leather
which
they
wound
round
their
crooks
the
ancient
welch
had
a
peculiar
manner
of
writing
upon
small
squared
oblong
pieces
of
wood
which
they
called
which
name
forms
the
appellative
to
numerous
of
their
productions

a
grant
to
the
ambrosian
church
at
milan

on
the
skin
of
a
fish

the
alexandrian
library

were
the
works
of

at
last
we
have
arrived
at
the
period
for
the
introduction
of
the
egyptian
papyrus
a
kind
of
rush
of
large
dimensions
growing
in
the
marshes
on
the
banks
of
the
nile
this
plant
is
described
as
growing
in
swamps
to
the
height
of
fifteen
feet

of
a
thickness
to
be
spanned
surrounded
near
the
root

on
the
top
a
bush
resembling
the

with
hairs
or
long
thin
straight
fibres
root
brown
the
egyptian
papyrus
was
manufactured
into
paper
from
very
fine
pellicles
near
its
pith
separated
by
a
pin
or
pointed
spread
on
a
table
in
such
form
as
was
required
sprinkled
with
nile
water
on
the
first
layer
a
second
layer
was
laid
crosswise
to
finish
the
sheet
then
pressed
hung
to
dry
and
afterwards
polished
with
a
tooth
the
nile
water
was
very
carefully
used
to
prevent
spots
twenty
skins
were
the
greatest
number
which
could
be
procured
from
one
plant
those
nearest
the
pith
made
the
finest
paper
twenty
sheets
glued
together
were
called
but
sometimes
went
to
form
a
this
part
of
the
business
was
executed
by
the
who
resembled
our
bookbinders
this
plant
yielded
materials
for
making
four
sorts
of
paper
with
respect
to
other
substances
for
the
same
purpose
there
are
many
but
as
most
of
these
have
one
generic
character
being
manufactured
from
the
bark
of
trees
the
detail
is
not
here
given
as
it
might
not
perhaps
be
generally
interesting
especially
as
nothing
new
appears
in
this
respect
with
respect
to
the
paper
now
in
use
blair
says
the
first
in
england
we
suppose
was
erected
at
dartford
in
the
year
by
a
german
of
the
name
of
spiellman
from
which
period
we
may
perhaps
date
its
manufacture
in
this
country
it
appears
however
that
it
was
known
in
the
east
much
earlier
it
being
observed
that
most
of
the
ancient
manuscripts
in
arabic
and
other
oriental
languages
were
written
upon
cotton
paper
and
it
is
thought
the
saracens
first
introduced
it
into
spain
anderson
in
his
of
commerce
says
that
till
the
year
there
was
scarcely
any
paper
made
in
england
but
the
coarse
brown
sort
paper
was
previously
imported
from
france
genoa
and
however
the
improvement
of
this
article
in
england
in
consequence
of
the
french
war
produced
a
saving
to
this
country
of
annually
which
had
been
paid
to
france
for
paper
alone
after
linen
and
cotton
are
so
much
worn
as
to
be
unfit
for
any
other
purpose
the
several
kinds
are
collected
together
and
the
hard
seams
and
other
accumulations
which
would
require
a
much
longer
time
to
prepare
proper
for
the
general
mass
than
would
be
consistent
with
the
economy
of
the
whole
those
shreds
are
then
separated
and
thrown
away
the
different
kinds
are
then
collected
and
kept
separate
from
each
other
in
such
a
state
of
separation
they
are
laid
in
troughs
which
are
afterwards
filled
with
water
where
they
are
suffered
to
remain
till
a
species
of
fermentation
takes
place
and
the
separation
of
the
parts
formed
by
art
is
not
only
rendered
easy
but
also
a
division
may
be
made
of
the
most
minute
parts
the
separation
is
then
made
by
machinery
when
properly
prepared
a
sufficient
quantity
is
placed
upon
a
wire
frame
or
otherwise
one
formed
of
cloth
by
mechanical
pressure
the
moisture
is
extracted
after
which
the
sheets
are
hung
up
separately
on
lines
to
dry
in
a
building
properly
constructed
to
admit
a
free
circulation
of
air
manufacturers
of
paper
originally
could
only
use
white
rags
to
make
white
paper
but
campbell
in
discovered
a
method
of
discharging
any
colour
from
rags
by
bleaching
with
acid
gas
for
which
he
obtained
a
patent
the
next
considerable
improvement
which
appears
to
have
been
made
in
the
manufacture
of
paper
consists
in
using
felt
or
woollen
cloth
in
conjunction
with
the
wire
cloth
formerly
used
and
now
of
necessity
retained
and
other
processes
too
voluminous
to
be
inserted
here
the
only
remaining
circumstance
we
have
to
mention
is
that
in
the
beginning
of
the
present
century
there
was
manufactured
in
the
vicinity
of
london
a
very
good
printing
paper
made
entirely
from
wheat
straw
for
which
manufacture
the
inventor
obtained
a
patent
but
he
did
not
succeed
we
presume
because
it
is
now
discontinued
considerable
quantities
of
paper
is
now
made
from
straw
in
france
but
it
is
of
a
yellow
tinge
paper
made
from
linen
is
the
best
paper
hanging
the
desire
of
man
for
the
gratification
of
his
natural
wants
being
soon
satisfied
he
yet
is
wanting
those
artificial
wants
which
arise
in
the
mind
and
are
the
source
of
his
comforts
because
their
gratification
yields
him
high
delight
having
built
him
a
house
to
shelter
himself
from
the
exigencies
of
the
weather
to
enlarge
the
sphere
of
his
pleasures
he
is
desirous
to
ornament
it
and
because
he
can
not
perhaps
construct
his
house
of
silver
gold
or
costly
stones
he
endeavours
at
least
to
have
an
imitation
and
gilding
lacquering
painting
or
staining
is
substituted
this
idea
we
will
presume
to
have
given
origin
to
every
species
of
decorative
ornament
in
the
construction
of
houses
and
among
the
rest
to
which
is
carried
on
to
a
greater
extent
in
this
country
than
at
any
former
period
the
ancient
greeks
according
to
archbishop
potter
constructed
not
only
their
arms
but
also
their
houses
occasionally
of
brass
whilst
the
romans
frequently
gilt
theirs
they
often
covered
them
with
costly
casings
or
veneers
sometimes
with
precious
stones
since
they
went
to
such
great
cost
to
ornament
the
outside
of
their
habitations
we
need
not
wonder
that
they
spared
no
expense
in
endeavouring
to
ornament
them
those
people
however
who
could
not
procure
these
extravagancies
in
reality
thought
they
would
at
least
have
the
nearest
imitation
of
them
accordingly
they
had
recourse
sometimes
to
veneers
of
those
substances
they
had
seen
substantially
employed
by
the
rich
and
luxurious
as
well
for
outside
ornament
as
interior
decoration
those
who
could
not
afford
this
had
recourse
to
pigments
and
the
graphic
art
for
this
purpose
the
ingenuity
of
man
was
employed
to
devise
various
modes
of
ornament
and
decoration
hence
arose
the
various
kinds
of
painting
the
fresco
scagliolo
and
lastly
came
staining
of
paper
in
use
to
enumerate
the
various
kinds
of
this
might
be
attended
with
very
little
benefit
because
the
principle
of
all
is
nearly
the
same
however
it
has
been
remarked
that
three
kinds
are
deserving
of
notice
the
first
and
plainest
is
that
which
has
on
it
figures
drawn
and
painted
with
one
or
more
colours
consisting
only
of
painted
paper
the
second
contains
a
woolly
stuff
dyed
of
various
tints
and
made
to
adhere
to
the
paper
in
certain
forms
by
a
glutinous
matter
and
the
third
is
a
species
of
paper
covered
with
metallic
dust
there
are
other
papers
used
for
hangings
which
contain
a
representation
of
many
kinds
of
stones
of
which
we
understand
there
is
a
large
manufactory
in
leipsic
there
is
also
a
species
of
velvet
paper
a
paper
covered
with
sham
plush
or
wool
dyed
and
cut
short
and
made
to
adhere
to
the
paper
by
some
kind
of
cement
said
to
have
been
the
invention
of
an
englishman
of
the
name
of
jerome
lanyer
in
the
reign
of
charles
for
which
he
received
a
patent
in
the
specification
it
is
stated
that
he
had
found
out
an
art
and
mystery
for
affixing
wool
silk
and
other
materials
upon
linen
cotton
leather
and
other
substances
with
oil
size
and
cements
so
as
to
make
them
useful
and
serviceable
for
hangings
and
other
purposes
which
he
called
londrindina
and
he
said
it
was
his
own
invention
and
formerly
used
within
this
realm
however
it
appears
that
this
invention
of
lanyer
was
afterwards
disputed
by
a
frenchman
of
the
name
of
tierce
who
said
it
was
the
production
of
a
countryman
of
his
named
francois
who
he
stated
had
made
such
before
and
supported
his
assertion
by
producing
patterns
and
the
wooden
blocks
with
which
it
was
printed
with
the
dates
inscribed
upon
them
the
son
of
francois
it
appeared
followed
his
business
at
rouen
for
more
than
fifty
years
where
he
died
in
some
of
his
workmen
are
said
to
have
left
him
and
gone
to
the
netherlands
germany
and
other
places
where
they
sold
their
art
it
appears
that
nemetz
ascribes
the
invention
of
hangings
with
wool
chopped
and
beat
fine
to
a
frenchman
named
andran
who
he
says
in
the
beginning
of
the
last
century
was
an
excellent
painter
in
arabesque
and
grotesque
figures
and
inspector
of
the
palace
of
the
luxembourg
at
paris
in
which
he
had
a
manufactory
for
hangings
of
that
kind
it
is
also
stated
that
a
person
of
the
name
of
eccard
invented
the
art
of
printing
on
gold
and
silver
figures
and
that
he
carried
on
an
extensive
manufactory
for
such
works
it
certainly
does
appear
that
the
germans
can
not
claim
the
privilege
of
invention
here
but
were
behind
their
neighbours
in
this
art
one
of
the
most
ingenious
of
the
many
new
improvements
is
said
to
consist
in
the
art
of
manufacturing
by
affixing
to
the
substance
of
the
proper
metallic
dust
commonly
called
nuremberg
dust
by
which
it
acquires
the
appearance
of
various
costly
metals
in
a
state
of
fracture
varied
with
glittering
particles
of
differently
formed
parts
and
receiving
the
light
in
every
direction
produce
certainly
a
novel
effect
which
is
rich
and
beautiful
while
it
is
obtained
at
little
expense
the
nuremberg
metallic
dust
is
said
to
have
been
the
invention
of
an
artist
of
that
city
named
john
hautsch
born
in
died
in
his
descendants
have
continued
its
preparation
to
the
present
time
it
is
produced
from
filings
of
metals
of
several
descriptions
washed
well
in
a
strong
lixivious
water
then
being
placed
upon
a
sheet
of
copper
are
put
upon
a
strong
fire
and
continually
stirred
till
the
colour
is
altered
those
of
tin
by
this
process
acquire
every
shade
of
gold
colour
with
its
metallic
lustre

of

colour
those
of

or

a

mixed
a

white
colour
the
dust
tinged
in
this
manner
is
then
put
through
a
consisting
of
two
rollers
of
the
hardest
steel
like
those
used
by
gold
and
silver
for
the
greater
convenience
a
funnel

placed
over
them
french
covered
paper
manufactured
from
this
material

called

its
lustre

so
durable
that
it
is
said
to
continue
unaltered
for
many
years
even
on
the
walls
of
sitting
apartments
this
metallic
dust
is
an
article
of
commerce
being
exported
from
germany
as
early
as
the
seventeenth
century
the
miners
of
silesia
collected
and
sold
for
various
purposes
a
material
they
call
being
bright
shining
particles
of
various
metals
which
those
mines
produce
in
great
profusion
even
the
black
we
are
told
acquires
a
gold
colour
by
being
exposed
to
a
strong
heat
this
was
manufactured
by
the
holy
sisters
of
reichenstein
into
a
variety
of
ornaments
with
it
they
decorated
their
images
strewing
over
them
a
shining
kind
of
the
silver
coloured
glimmer
had
not
however
so
great
a
brilliancy
or
variety
as
the
nuremberg
metallic
dust
for
which
purposes
that
article
has
a
decided
superiority
for
the
various
purposes
to
which
these
ornaments
are
to
be
applied
different
adhesive
substances
should
be
used
in
some
cases
glue
would
have
the
effect
to
be
first
drawn
over
the
substance
in
others
a
strong
varnish
in
which
wax
is
dissolved
and
for
others
various
kinds
of
gums
those
substances
being
so
covered
the
dust
may
be
put
in
a
common
and
applied
by
sifting
it
over
the
substance
to
be
so
covered
different
figures
may
be
drawn
with
a
pencil
and
the
box
of
dust
shook
over
them
as
far
as
the
extent
of
the
lines
covered
with
glue
the
dust
will
only
fasten
so
far
as
it
meets
with
what
produces
adhesion
painting
its
origin
is
to
be
traced
up
to
that
known
source
from
whence
most
of
those
arts
which
humanise
society
and
lend
a
polish
to
life
first
had
being
diodorus
siculus
speaks
of
bricks
burnt
in
the
fire
with
various
colours
representing
the
natural
appearance
of
men
and
animals
which
is
the
first
fact
upon
record
as
this
occurred
during
the
building
of
babylon
it
is
as
remote
an
original
as
we
are
perhaps
authorised
to
depend
upon
although
it
is
extremely
probable
it
might
be
traced
to
an
anterior
date
which
conclusion
though
made
from
inference
alone
we
are
allowed
to
suppose
must
have
been
the
case
as
a
knowledge
of
the
nature
of
pigments
must
first
have
been
ascertained
before
the
chaldean
artists
could
have
been
informed
what
colours
would
fade
or
what
would
withstand
the
operation
of
the
enamelling
process
in
the
intense
heat
necessary
to
produce
the
effect
they
must
at
least
have
understood
the
difference
between
vegetable
colours
which
are
the
first
presented
to
the
senses
and
most
probably
were
the
first
which
were
used
and
those
afforded
by
the
mineral
kingdom
which
alone
were
proper
for
the
operation
they
performed
therefore
the
arts
of
painting
and
chemistry
we
would
presume
must
have
made
considerable
progress
prior
to
the
erection
of
the
tower
of
babel
the
next
people
who
in
point
of
time
as
well
as
of
importance
offer
themselves
to
the
notice
of
modern
europeans
are
the
egyptians
and
their
perfection
in
the
use
of
the
various
colours
which
constitute
the
compound
idea
we
entertain
when
we
think
of
painting
is
well
known
and
appreciated
when
we
may
any
day
consult
our
judgment
by
inspecting
those
beautiful
specimens
of
their
eternal
mode
of
colouring
we
have
in
the
exhibition
on
in
the
british
museum
and
other
depositories
of
that
species
of
antique
preservation
the
third
people
who
excelled
in
giving
a
beautiful
and
tasteful
variety
to
surfaces
in
colouring
and
effect
were
the
etrurians
a
people
anciently
inhabiting
a
district
of
italy
now
known
as
tuscany
of
the
perfection
to
which
they
brought
the
art
we
may
form
an
adequate
and
proper
judgment
by
inspecting
those
beautiful
vases
preserved
in
the
hamiltonian
collection
in
the
british
museum
and
also
in
some
very
curious
specimens
of
ancient
painting
procured
from
the
ruins
of
herculaneum
collected
likewise
by
sir
william
hamilton
it
can
not
be
doubted
that
most
distinct
societies
of
men
have
after
the
gratification
of
their
first
wants
and
when
leisure
hours
permitted
the
exercise
of
their
ingenious
and
inventive
faculties
invented
a
great
variety
of
useful
and
ornamental
arts
therefore
there
can
not
be
a
question
but
various
arts
of
utility
as
well
as
of
ornament
have
been
invented
by
a
great
variety
of
people
who
all
agreeably
to
our
prior
definitions
are
well
entitled
to
the
distinct
appellation
of
original
inventors
consequently
in
such
a
case
question
must
evidently
submit
to
the
determination
of
chronology
eudora
the
daughter
of
a
potter
of
corinth
is
presumed
to
have
introduced
the
art
into
greece
the
art
of
painting
in
greece
is
also
claimed
by
sicyon
as
the
original
fuseli
has
beautifully
observed
in
his
first
lecture
illustrative
of
the
former
of
these
two
claimants
that
ever
legend
deserved
our
belief
the
amorous
tale
of
the
corinthian
maid
who
traced
the
shadow
of
her
departing
lover
by
the
secret
lamp
appeals
to
our
sympathy
to
grant
this
invention
is
becoming
doubly
interesting
in
that
country
first
because
of
its
elegance
and
utility
and
secondly
because
it
is
ascribed
to
one
of
the
noblest
and
most
powerful
passions
which
distinguish
the
human
species
the
wonderful
effects
of
which
have
given
to
humanity
the
most
exalted
and
illustrious
of
actions
which
ennoble
the
character
of
man
to
delicate
refined
and
almighty
love
numerous
artists
in
the
grecian
school
brought
the
art
of
painting
to
great
perfection
the
restorer
of
this
delightful
art
in
europe
was
cimabue
a
native
of
italy
who
first
studied
under
some
grecian
artists
and
furnished
some
admirable
productions
in
fresco
in
several
italian
churches
about
the
renovation
of
the
arts
in
modern
italy
since
which
time
this
purely
intellectual
art
has
been
successfully
cultivated
in
almost
all
the
countries
of
europe
certain
masters
in
all
schools
of
which
have
been
eminent
for
some
peculiar
eminence
an
analogy
has
been
drawn
by
comparison
between
the
fascinating
effect
of
music
on
the
ear
and
colour
on
the
eye
wherein
it
is
observed
the
comparison
very
nearly
approximates
whence
the
term
applied
to
the
former
may
correctly
and
with
singular
propriety
be
used
when
speaking
of
the
latter
and
also
it
is
said
for
the
same
reason
and
proceeding
upon
the
like
analogy
the
term
is
applicable
to
both
they
are
accordingly
used
indiscriminately
without
questioning
their
propriety
we
give
in
to
our
sensations
and
as
far
as
our
judgment
goes
believe
they
are
not
improperly
introduced
into
the
pictorial
art
it
can
not
be
presumed
that
we
should
have
the
temerity
to
aspire
to
the
task
of
giving
a
full
and
complete
description
of
every
variety
which
constitutes
perfection
in
the
art
for
this
would
be
to
infer
professional
ability
equal
or
perhaps
superior
to
what
any
one
individual
ever
was
or
we
may
venture
to
say
ever
will
be
known
to
possess
besides
this
inference
another
must
be
presumed
because
perfection
in
description
must
also
anticipate
the
most
delicate
refined
and
as
termed
classically
correct
taste
neither
to
these
do
we
assume
the
possession
of
such
essentials
as
are
positively
necessary
to
its
formation
it
is
besides
altogether
difficult
as
the
world
acknowledges
to
fix
a
standard
to
the
ideal
faculty
of
taste
and
which
we
hereby
take
occasion
to
notice
therefore
we
hope
to
avoid
the
sin
of
presumption
and
trust
that
our
readers
will
observe
that
what
we
do
state
is
upon
good
authority
if
we
have
not
full
confidence
in
our
own
experience
but
our
sin
if
sin
there
be
is
rather
that
of
omission
than
of
commission
of
saying
too
little
rather
than
too
much
statuary
the
origin
of
statuary
or
what
we
would
term
its
parent
modelling
is
of
very
great
antiquity
as
we
are
authoratively
informed
by
the
grecian
historians
whose
testimony
is
supported
by
monsieur
and
major
rennel
two
of
the
most
eminent
geographers
of
modern
times
from
them
we
learn
that
three
massy
statues
of
gold
were
erected
to
ornament
the
temple
of
jupiter
belus
those
were
erected
by
the
chaldeans
about
two
thousand
two
hundred
and
thirty
years
before
christ
there
is
also
sufficient
evidence
that
the
most
eminent
and
intellectual
people
subsequent
to
the
chaldeans
were
the
egyptians
every
individual
who
is
in
the
slightest
degree
conversant
with
the
history
of
the
arts
knows
that
the
egyptian
artisans
had
from
the
earliest
periods
been
in
the
habit
of
constructing
colossal
statues
of
their
numerous
deities
and
also
of
their
benefactors
raised
from
gratitude
and
adulation
to
name
only
a
single
instance
the
immense
colossal
statue
of
memnon
who
perished
before
the
fall
of
troy
according
to
homer
also
ovid
who
speaking
of
his
mother
aurora
says
troy
nor
hecuba
could
now
bemoan
she
weeps
a
sad
misfortune
now
her
own
her
offspring
memnon
by
achilles
slain
she
saw
extended
on
the
phrygian
professor
flaxman
has
informed
us
that
this
celebrated
statue
had
it
stood
upright
would
have
measured
feet
and
a
half
high
calculating
from
the
dimensions
of
its
ear
which
is
three
feet
long
we
are
informed
by
rees
in
his
valuable
cyclopedia
that
sculpture
in
marble
was
not
introduced
till
eight
hundred
and
years
before
christ
but
having
said
this
much
for
the
origin
let
us
proceed
to
the
art
and
we
candidly
acknowledge
that
it
is
from
the
lectures
of
that
truly
distinguished
individual
professsor
flaxman
we
are
principally
indebted
for
our
information
sculpture
in
greece
remained
long
in
a
rude
state
but
we
need
not
wonder
at
that
when
we
reflect
that
art
is
only
an
imitation
of
nature
hence
it
follows
that
man
in
a
rude
state
of
nature
for
want
of
proper
principles
to
direct
his
inquiries
and
determine
his
judgment
is
continually
liable
to
errors
physical
moral
and
religious
all
his
productions
of
what
kind
soever
partake
of
this
primitive
imbecility
the
early
arts
of
design
in
greece
resembled
those
of
other
barbarous
nations
until
the
successive
intellectual
and
natural
political
and
civil
advantages
of
this
people
raised
them
above
the
arts
of
the
surrounding
nations
the
science
employed
by
the
greeks
may
be
traced
in
anatomy
geometry
mechanics
and
perspective
from
their
earlier
authors
and
coeval
monuments
homer
had
described
the
figure
with
accuracy
but
insufficient
for
general
purposes
of
hippocrates
was
the
first
who
enumerated
the
bones
and
wrote
a
compendious
account
of
the
principles
of
the
human
figure
he
described
the
shoulders
the
curves
of
the
ribs
hips
and
knees
the
characters
of
the
arms
and
legs
in
the
same
simple
manner
in
which
they
are
represented
in
the
basso
relievo
of
the
parthenon
now
in
the
national
gallery
of
the
british
museum
the
ancient
artists
saw
the
figure
continually
exposed
in
all
actions
and
circumstances
so
as
to
have
little
occasion
for
other
assistance
to
perfect
their
works
and
they
had
also
the
assistance
of
casting
drawing
and
other
subsidiary
means
the
succeeding
ancient
anatomists
did
not
describe
the
human
figure
more
minutely
or
advantageously
for
the
artist
than
had
been
done
by
hippocrates
till
the
time
of
galen
whose
external
anatomy
gave
example
for
that
analytical
accuracy
of
arrangement
followed
by
more
modern
artists
sculpture
however
profited
little
from
labours
for
the
arts
of
design
were
in
his
time
in
a
retrogade
motion
towards
anterior
barbarism
the
anatomical
researches
from
alcmæon
of
crotona
a
disciple
of
pythagoras
to
those
of
hippocrates
and
his
scholars
assisted
phidias
and
praxiteles
their
contemporaries
and
successors
in
giving
select
and
appropriate
forms
of
body
and
limbs
to
their
several
divinities
whose
characters
were
fixed
by
the
artists
from
the
rhapsodies
of
homer
having
then
become
popular
among
the
athenians
phidias
was
the
first
in
this
reformation
minerva

his
hand

young
and
beautiful

had
before
been
harsh
and
elderly

jupiter
was
awful
as
when
his
nod
shook
the
poles
but
benignant
as
when
he
smiled
on
his
daughter
venus
apollo
and
bacchus
then
assumed
youthful
resemblances
of
their
sire
the
first
more
majestic
the
latter
more
feminine
whilst
mercury
as
patron
of
gymnastic
exercises
was
represented
as
more
robust
than
his
brother
hercules
became
gradually
more
powerful
and
the
forms
of
inferior
heroes
displayed
a
nearer
resemblance
to
common
nature
from
which
both
sentiment
and
beauty
can
alone
be
given
to
imitative
art
the
near
approach
of
ancient
art
to
nature
considering
their
high
advance
to
accuracy
of
imitation
should
likewise
encourage
the
modern
to
imitate
the
ancient
artists
the
moderns
now
also
enjoy
superior
auxiliary
assistance
from
engraving

books

the

of
the

is
the

ultimate
of
beauty
observed
in
the
visible
works
of
creative
omnipotence
from
thence
every
other
species
of
beauty
graduates
in
just
of
proportion
from
considering
the
intellectual
faculties
of
man
we
assimilate
the
idea
and
connect
beauty
with
utility
as
this
union
of
his
physical
and
mental
powers
unquestionably
renders
him
one
of
the
most
beautiful
objects
in
the
creation
this
consideration
leads
us
involuntarily
to
a
train
of
thought
suggested
by
a
principle
laid
down
by
plato
nothing
is
beautiful
which
is
not
truly
good
which
also
induces
the
following
corollary
and
which
is
confirmed
by
reason
and
sanctioned
by
revelation
that
of
human
beauty
consists
of
the
most
virtuous
soul
in
the
most
healthy
and
perfect
inasmuch
as
painters
and
sculptors
adhered
to
those
principles
in
their
work
they
assisted
to
enforce
a
popular
impression
of
divine
attributes
and
perfections
even
in
ages
of
gross
idolatry
in
the
highest
order
of
divinities
the

of

achilles

as
the
public
have
now
an
opportunity
of
consulting
many
of
the
objects
above
referred
to
in
our
great
national
gallery
in
the
british
museum
those
of
our
readers
who
can
obtain
this
advantage
will
do
well
to
pay
a
visit
to
that
celebrated
depository
for
the
relics
of
antiquity
where
they
will
have
it
in
their
power
to
convince
themselves
of
the
truth
of
the
foregoing
remarks
the
progeny
of
ham
the
son
of
noah
we
find
peopled
egypt
medea
chaldea
phœnicia
and
several
other
adjoining
countries
it
will
be
remembered
that
two
of
the
three
sons
of
noah
possessed
these
countries
which
the
folly
of
idolatry
overflowed
whilst
it
was
in
the
line
of
shem
alone
that
the
true
faith
was
continued
the
mosaiac
narrative
is
chiefly
descriptive
of
events
which
occurred
in
the
posterity
of
that
patriarch
because
from
it
the
righteous
line
of
the
faithful
in
abraham
david
solomon
and
ultimately
christ
proceeded
thus
more
than
of
the
inhabitants
of
the
world
were
gross
idolators
we
often
find
the
omniscience
of
the
highest
forewarning
the
sacred
line
to
avoid
its
fascinations
nay
when
upon
more
occasions
than
one
the
descendants
of
the
faithful
forgot
themselves
and
those
admonitions
of
the
creator
were
neglected
we
find
the
sacred
race
flying
before
the
face
of
puny
foes
which
defeat
was
declared
to
be
from
their
having
prostrated
themselves
before
strange
gods
they
were
bowed
thus
low
in
battle
not
to
mention
their
disobedience
immediately
beneath
mount
sinai
which
protracted
their
journey
through
the
wilderness
to
forty
years
which
perhaps
under
other
circumstances
would
not
have
required
as
many
days
all
those
troubles
their
subsequent
captivities
and
national
afflictions
were
the
produce
of
disobedience
this
is
one
of
those
means
which
retributive
justice
resorts
to
punish
wilful
sin
so
however
it
was
with
the
seed
of
abraham
and
so
it
is
presumed
to
be
with
the
present
race
of
men
either
immediate
or
remote
punishment
vindicates
the
omnipotence
of
heaven
from
the
frequent
maledictions
we
discover
in
the
sacred
volume
against
idol
worship
we
can
not
doubt
that
it
was
peculiarly
offensive
to
the
deity
that
the
great
majority
of
the
world
were
addicted
to
this
proscribed
practice
is
equally
certain
and
as
the
spirit
of
truth
had
declared
in
the
decalogue
that
would
not
be
worshipped
under
any
form
in
the
heavens
above
in
the
earth
below
or
in
the
waters
under
the
earth
so
was
and
consequently
the
construction
of
such
things
forbidden
we
discover
that
as
this
mania
infected
all
nations
tongues
and
people
so
did
not
the
israelites
escape
it
but
immediately
after
their
departure
from
egypt
we
find
an
exact
similitude
of
the
sacred
calf
of
the
egyptians
cast
in
melted
gold
which
they
constructed
below
mount
sinai
in
egypt
metallic
statues
as
well
as
those
of
stone
must
have
existed
anterior
to
that
event
as
they
actually
had
done
to
our
own
knowledge
and
long
before
idolatry
had
made
its
appearance
in
egypt
it
had
existed
in
chaldea
as
already
shown
as
that
worship
had
first
its
being
in
chaldea
so
had
the
art
of
statuary
its
origin
in
that
country
it
was
improved
perhaps
in
egypt
and
perfected
in
greece
from
the
time
of
pericles
to
that
of
alexander
commonly
called
the
great
drawing
the
human
figure
from
what
has
been
said
in
the
previous
article
it
would
appear
that
drawing
of
the
human
figure
was
nearly
coeval
with
the
art
of
statuary
or
perhaps
prior
to
it
in
greece
as
there
is
ample
room
to
suppose
the
rude
aboriginal
inhabitants
of
greece
borrowed
their
art
as
they
did
their
religious
and
civil
policy
from
the
egyptians
and
in
fact
from
every
nation
where
they
discovered
anything
worthy
their
attention
so
must
we
suppose
they
had
also
this
art
in
its
infancy
it
is
true
from
the
same
people
upon
reflecting
for
a
single
moment
we
are
fully
satisfied
that
the
origin
of
the
art
now
under
contemplation
came
from
egypt
an
ancient
philosopher
expressed
himself
with
great
truth
when
he
said
was
first
we
accordingly
perceive
the
necessity
of
the
earliest
inhabitants
of
egypt
to
exercise
the
art
of
drawing
they
having
determined
to
record
their
transactions
by
hieroglyphical
representation
we
have
not
the
slightest
doubt
but
we
have
now
in
the
british
museum
some
of
the
earliest
specimens
of
egyptian
hieroglyphical
delineation
in
the
from
its
inscription
it
has
been
discovered
that
that
identical
monument
can
not
be
less
than
three
thousand
five
hundred
and
years
old
previous
to
this
we
can
have
no
doubt
that
the
art
of
drawing
must
have
existed
like
its
sister
art
sculpture
it
received
every
improvement
of
which
it
was
susceptible
from
the
mature
conceptions
and
the
delicate
hand
of
grecian
artisans
words
are
perhaps
inadequate
to
convey
this
art
to
a
second
person
years
of
incessant
labour
with
an
attention
to
principles
established
and
found
to
correspond
correctly
with
nature
are
the
only
means
to
obtain
a
just
knowledge
of
its
principles
and
to
judge
tastefully
of
its
correct
execution
however
in
addition
to
the
rules
laid
down
in
the
preceding
article
we
add
the
following
which
have
been
approved
by
sir
joshua
reynolds
by
no
means
a
contemptible
judge
of
the
art
that
from
the
crown
of
the
head
to
the
forehead
is
the
third
part
of
a
face
the
face
begins
at
the
root
of
the
lowest
hairs
that
grow
on
the
forehead
and
ends
at
the
bottom
of
the
chin
the
face
is
divided
into
three
proportionate
parts
the
first
contains
the
forehead
or
brow
the
second
the
nose
and
the
third
the
mouth
and
chin
from
the
chin
to
the
pit
between
the
is
two
lengths
of
a
nose
from
the
pit
between
the

the
bottom
of
the
breast
one
face
from
the
bottom
of
the
breast
to
the
navel
one
face
from
the
navel
to
the
genitories
one
face
from
the
genitories
to
the
upper
part
of
the
knee
two
faces
the
knee
contains
half
a
face
from
the
lower
part
of
the
knee
to
the
ancle
two
faces
from
the
ancle
to
the
sole
of
the
foot
half
a

a
man
with
his
arms
extended
is
from
his
longest
finger
on
each
hand
as
broad
as
he
is
long
from
one
side
of
the
breast
to
the
other
two
faces
the
bone
of
the
arm
called
from
the
shoulder
to
the
elbow
joint
is
the
length
of
two
faces
from
the
end
of
the
elbow
to
the
joint
of
the
little
finger
the
bone
called
with
a
part
of
the
hand
is
also
two
faces
from
the
box
of
the
to
the
pit
between
the
one
face
to
be
satisfied
in
measures
of
breadth
from
the
extremity
of
one
finger
to
the
other
so
that
his
breadth
should
be
equal
to
the
length
it
should
be
observed
that
the
bones
of
the
elbows
with
the
and
the
with
the
or
bear
the
proportions
of
a
face
when
the
arms
are
extended
the
sole
of
the
foot
is
part
of
the
length
of
the
entire
figure
the
hand
is
the
length
of
a
face
the
thumb
contains
a
nose
in
length
the
inside
of
the
arm
from
the
place
where
the
muscle
disappears
which
is
connected
with
the
breast
called
the
pectoral
muscle
to
the
middle
of
the
arm
four
noses
long
from
the
middle
of
the
arm
at
the
top
to
the
beginning
of
the
head
five
noses
the
longest
toe
is
one
nose
the
outermost
parts
of
the
paps
and
the
pit
between
the
of
a
female
form
an
equilateral
triangle
the
knowledge
of
the
preceding
proportions
are
as
mere
rudiments
essential
to
the
delineation
of
the
human
figure
but
they
relate
to
a
body
in
a
quiescent
state
only
the
more
difficult
task
remains
to
become
thoroughly
acquainted
with
its
actions
to
obtain
this
a
rudimental
and
even
an
intimate
acquaintance
with
the
skeleton
and
assiduous
and
incessant
practice
are
necessary
however
the
lectures
delivered
to
the
royal
academy
have
furnished
us
with
the
probable
extent
to
which
the
motions
of
the
human
frame
may
be
carried
first
premising
that
the
motions
of
the
head
and
trunk
of
the
body
are
limited
by
the
several
joints
of
the
spine
the
motion
of
the
body
upon
the
lower
limbs
takes
place
at
the
at
the
knees
and
at
the
ancles
those
limbs
called
great
limbs
the
whole
frame
being
technically
divided
and
denominated
the
upper
and
lower
extremities
have
rotatory
motions
at
their
junctions
with
the
trunk
by
means
of
a
ball
and
socket
joints
at
the
shoulders
and
the
hips
the
analogy
of
parts
between
the
upper
and
lower
extremities
is
not
carried
through
the
structure
of
those
limbs
in
the
body
the
fulcrum
of
the
upper
limb
is
itself
moveable
upon
the
trunk
as
appears
from
the
extensive
motions
of
the
scapula
which
so
generally
accompany
the
rotation
of
the
shoulder
and
supply
the
limb
with
a
great
variety
of
motion
much
more
than
the
lower
limb
possesses
the
junction
of
the
thigh
with
the
mass
without
motion
called
the
limits
its
rotation
to
the
ball
and
without
farther
extension
the
rotation
of
the
head
and
neck
takes
place
at
the
joint
between
the
first
and
second
vertebræ
when
the
nose
is
parallel
with
the
the
face
may
be
turned
towards
either
shoulder
through
an
angle
of
deg
on
each
side
the
whole
range
of
its
motion
being
degrees
the
lateral
bending
of
the
neck
is
equally
divided
between
the
seven
vertebræ
but
the
bowing
of
the
head
and
violently
tossing
it
backward
are
chiefly
effected
at
the
joint
of
the
skull
and
the
first
bone
of
the
vertebral
column
called
the
atlas
although
the
preceding
motions
are
consistent
with
an
erect
stature
of
the
neck
yet
the
lateral
motions
demand
a
curvature
of
its
whole
mass
the
movements
of
the
trunk
are
regulated
by
rotary
and
lateral
motions
nearly
equally
divided
among
the
several
joints
of
the
vertebræ
of
the
back
and
loins
the
joints
or
the
dorsal
or
back
vertebræ
are
notwithstanding
more
close
and
compact
than
those
of
the
loins
allowing
of
a
wider
range
for
bending
and
turning
in
the
loins
than
the
back
the
sternum
and
ribs
move
upward
to
assist
the
chest
in
the
expansion
required
for
respiration
drawing
the
clavicles
and
the
shoulders
upwards
in
full
inspiration
and
tend
to
a
contrary
motion
on
expiration
such
movements
also
characterise
strong
action
and
certain
passion
and
very
apparent
in
a
naked
figure
in
stooping
to
touch
the
ground
the
forms
an
angle
of
somewhere
about
degrees
with
the
average
direction
of
the
vertebræ
the
leg
bends
upon
the
thigh
at
an
angle
of
about
degrees
and
the
line
of
the
forms
with
the
sole
of
the
foot
when
that
is
elevated
an
angle
of
degrees
the
whole
of
this
limb
is
susceptible
of
motion
at
the
forwards
to
a
right
angle
with
its
perpendicular
position
and
backwards
to
an
angle
of
degrees
the
leg
will
then
continue
to
move
by
itself
to
its
own
angle
of
degrees
with
the
thigh
its
extreme
motion
does
not
exceed
degrees
when
the
shoulders
are
quiescent
the
clavicles
usually
meet
in
an
angle
of
degrees
at
the
sternum
the
utmost
elevation
of
the
upper
joint
of
the
arm
generally
forms
an
angle
of
degrees
with
the
vertebræ
and
about
degrees
with
the
line
of
its
clavicle
the
flexion
of
the
upon
its
upper
part
is
confined
to
an
angle
of
nearly
degrees
the
whole
arm
is
capable
of
moving
forward
or
outward
through
nearly
degrees
and
backward
to
nearly
the
same
angle
with
its
perpendicular
station
the
actions
of
pronation
and
supination
in
the
hand
range
through
all
intermediate
degrees
from
a
horizontal
or
perpendicular
direction
to
degrees
but
degrees
of
its
rotary
motion
in
pronation
comes
from
the
shoulder
joint
the
palm
of
the
hand
admits
of
flexion
and
extension
to
degrees
in
each
direction
its
lateral
motions
are
outward
and
inward
the
flexion
of
the
fingers
at
each
phalanx
is
a
right
angle
but
it
must
be
observed
that
in
drawing
the
joints
very
considerable
difference
is
found
in
their
length
from
inequality
of
action
the
elbow
joint
when
bent
inward
lengthens
the
arm
nearly
one
eighth
the
same
general
law
operates
on
the
knees
fingers
when
a
man
is
at
rest
and
standing
on
both
feet
a
line
drawn
perpendicularly
between
the
clavicles
will
fall
central
between
his
feet
should
he
stand
on
one
foot
it
falls
upon
the
heel
of
that
foot
which
supports
his
weight
if
he
raises
one
arm
it
will
throw
as
much
of
his
body
on
the
other
side
as
nature
requires
to
support
the
equilibrium
one
of
his
legs
thrown
back
brings
the
breast
forward
to
preserve
the
gravity
of
the
figure
the
same
will
be
observed
in
all
other
motions
of
the
parts
to
keep
the
central
gravitation
in
its
proper
place
the
equipoise
of
a
figure
is
of
two
sorts
simple
when
its
action
relates
to
itself
and
compound
when
it
refers
to
a
second
object
the
equilibrium
of
nature
is
constantly
preserved
for
in
walking
leaping
running
similar
precautions
are
taken
by
the
flexibility
of
our
bodies
in
striking
according
to
the
proportionate
force
meant
to
be
employed
the
body
is
first
drawn
back
then
the
limb
propelled
forward
bringing
with
it
the
weight
of
the
body
in
striking
lifting
throwing
a
greater
proportion
of
force
is
employed
than
may
be
necessary
to
effect
the
intended
purpose
this
is
mentioned
because
in
representation
the
force
employed
in
an
action
should
be
marked
in
the
muscle
producing
that
action
if
it
be
marked
rather
stronger
than
may
be
necessary
the
cause
is
obvious
for
nature
so
employs
her
powers
in
studying
this
art
students
should
have
selected
for
them
the
best
examples
to
copy
from
at
first
then
they
should
draw
from
the
figure
as
soon
as
possible
and
if
it
be
possible
from
the
best
specimens
of
the
antique
their
first
drawings
are
recommended
to
be
made
with
chalk
and
in
large
proportion
attention
to
these
will
communicate
ease
and
freedom
to
their
future
performances
it
will
be
likewise
found
necessary
for
them
to
draw
upon
geometrical
principles
this
communicates
a
truth
which
greatly
adds
to
their
certainty
and
confidence
and
ultimately
to
their
ease
this
is
mentioned
because
it
will
be
found
that
there
is
no
portion
of
the
human
frame
quiescent
or
in
an
active
state
but
what
is
susceptible
of
geometrical
definition
experience
and
exercise
communicate
truths
which
produce
certainty
whence
come
ease
and
grace
architecture
this
is
a
science
most
beneficial
to
humanity
it
is
very
evident
that
it
must
have
an
extremely
ancient
origin
the
origin
of
this
art
is
presumed
to
have
been
imitated
by
man
from
those
natural
caves
and
recesses
which
are
discovered
in
various
parts
of
the
earth
for
in
those
it
is
reported
the
first
men
took
shelter
from
the
inclemency
of
elemental
strife
and
to
avoid
the
piercing
contingencies
of
ultimate
and
precarious
uncertainty
the
oldest
buildings
in
the
world
are
accordingly
said
to
be
beneath
the
surface
of
the
earth
among
which
are
reckoned
the
famous
temple
of
elephanta
in
the
delta
of
the
ganges
the
catacombs
in
egypt
and
upon
the
surface
of
the
earth
the
tower
of
belus
at
babylon
the
egyptian
mausoleum
and
the
druidical
temples
in
gaul
and
britain
architecture
may
well
be
denominated
one
of
those
arts
which
accommodate
delight
and
give
consequence
to
the
human
species
while
at
the
same
time
it
is
calculated
to
flatter
pride
and
gratify
vanity
if
viewed
in
its
full
extent
it
may
be
truly
said
to
possess
a
very
considerable
portion
not
only
of
the
comforts
but
the
conveniences
the
positive
utilities
and
many
of
the
luxuries
of
life
the
advantages
derived
from
only
are
very
great
being
the
first
step
towards
civilization
having
great
influence
both
on
the
body
and
mind
of
man
secluded
from
each
other
in
woods
caves
and
wretched
huts
the
inhabitants
of
such
recesses
are
generally
found
to
be
men
indolent
dull
inactive
and
abject
their
faculties
benumbed
their
views
limited
to
the
gratification
of
their
individual
and
most
pressing
wants
but
when
societies
are
formed
and
commodious
dwellings
provided
where
well
sheltered
they
may
breathe
a
temperate
air
amid
scorching
heat
and
biting
cold
sleep
when
nature
requires
in
ease
and
security
study
unmolested
converse
and
taste
the
sweets
of
social
enjoyments
they
are
spirited
active
ingenious
and
enterprising
vigorous
in
body
and
active
in
mind
if
benefits
like
these
previously
enumerated
result
from
any
art
then
will
that
of
the
architect
claim
a
decided
when
we
reflect
on
the
almost
infinity
of
useful
purposes
to
which
this
art
is
conducive
that
it
erects
us
temples
for
the
worship
of
our
creator
the
benevolent
dispenser
of
all
good
things
that
it
provides
us
with
habitations
where
ease
and
simplicity
are
agreeably
combined
that
it
is
conducive
to
our
safety
comfort
and
convenience
in
uniting
different
districts
of
the
country
by
the
facility
of
bridges
roads
is
contributive
to
the
gratification
of
our
natural
wants
and
to
our
safety
as
inhabitants
of
a
great
commercial
country
the
benefits
we
derive
from
architecture
are
unspeakably
great
when
we
reflect
that
it
operates
as
a
medium
of
communication
between
us
an
insulated
people
and
the
whole
earth
in
its
remotest
colonies
that
it
serves
to
convey
between
our
people
and
the
most
distant
nations
the
native
produce
of
the
respective
countries
with
the
effects
of
mutual
industry
that
it
clothes
feeds
and
furnishes
employment
to
thousands
of
our
and
in
a
national
point
of
view
our
wooden
bulwarks
have
been
the
wonder
of
the
world
and
continues
to
afford
us
protection
from
our
enemies
should
all
other
hopes
fail
what
can
surpass
its
utility
in
the
latter
point
of
view
what
can
exceed
the
assistance
derived
from
it
by
the
criterions
formerly
mentioned
let
us
determine
we
shall
find
that
of
all
the
arts
the
world
has
ever
boasted
there
are
but
few
if
any
that
can
claim
a
superiority
there
are
no
other
designs
whether
necessary
or
superfluous
so
certainly
productive
of
their
desired
object
so
beneficial
in
consequences
or
so
permanent
in
their
effects
as
is
the
art
of
the
architect
most
other
inventions
which
afford
pleasure
and
satisfaction
soon
decay
their
fashion
fluctuates
their
value
is
lost
but
the
productions
of
architecture
command
general
attention
and
are
lasting
monuments
beyond
the
reach
of
ephemeral
modes
they
proclaim
to
distant
ages
the
consequence
genius
virtues
achievements
and
munificence
of
those
they
commemorate
to
the
latest
posterity
the
most
obvious
and
immediate
advantages
of
building
are
the
employment
of
numerous
ingenious
artificers
industrious
workmen
and
labourers
of
all
kinds
converting
materials
of
small
value
into
the
most
noble
productions
beautifying
countries
multiplying
the
comforts
and
conveniences
of
life
but
not
the
least
desirable
effects
of
the
art
perhaps
remain
yet
to
be
noticed
in
affording
to
the
numerous
train
of
arts
and
manufactures
concerned
to
furnish
and
adorn
the
works
of
architecture
which
employ
thousands
constituting
many
valuable
branches
of
commerce
also
from
that
certain
concourse
of
strangers
to
every
country
celebrated
for
stately
structures
who
extend
your
fame
into
other
countries
where
otherwise
it
would
never
have
been
heard
of
adopt
your
fashions
give
reputation
and
create
a
demand
for
your
productions
in
foreign
parts
these
are
circumstances
which
certainly
should
not
be
too
lightly
valued
and
these
circumstances
result
from
architecture
at
this
day
the
ruins
of
ancient
rome
support
the
splendour
of
the
modern
city
by
inviting
travellers
who
flock
from
all
nations
to
witness
those
majestic
remains
of
former
grandeur
the
same
may
be
said
of
many
other
countries
famous
for
architectural
remains
thus
architecture
by
supplying
men
with
commodious
habitations
procures
that
health
of
body
and
energy
of
mind
which
facilitates
the
invention
of
arts
when
by
the
exertion
of
their
skill
and
industry
productions
multiply
beyond
domestic
demand
she
furnishes
the
means
of
transporting
them
to
foreign
markets
whenever
by
commerce
they
acquire
wealth
she
points
the
way
to
employ
their
riches
rationally
nobly
and
benevolently
in
methods
honourable
and
useful
to
themselves
and
beneficial
to
posterity
which
add
splendour
to
the
state
and
yield
benefit
to
their
descendants
she
further
teaches
them
to
defend
her
possessions
to
secure
their
liberties
and
lives
from
attempts
of
lawless
violence
or
unrestrained
ambition
so
variously
conducive
to
human
happiness
is
this
art
to
the
wealth
and
safety
of
nations
so
naturally
does
it
demand
that
protection
and
encouragement
which
has
ever
been
yielded
it
in
all
well
governed
states
the
perfection
of
virtuous
other
arts
we
have
beheld
to
be
a
consequence
of
this
for
when
building
is
encouraged
painting
sculpture
and
every
species
of
decorative
art
will
flourish
of
course
it
should
not
however
be
imagined
that
the
heaping
of
stone
upon
stone
can
be
of
consequence
or
reflect
honour
on
individuals
or
nations
the
practice
of
architecture
infers
actual
art
to
be
an
essential
preliminary
without
this
and
having
some
laudable
end
in
view
it
is
apt
to
raise
disgust
this
art
is
generally
classed
under
three
distinct
heads
civil
military
and
naval
architecture
in
the
first
attempts
of
architecture
it
was
extremely
rude
as
might
naturally
be
expected
it
has
however
from
time
to
time
as
improvements
have
advanced
been
raised
to
relative
importance
as
the
education
of
the
people
progressed
and
it
certainly
gives
the
best
record
of
the
mental
progress
of
every
people
which
can
be
collected
it
has
always
been
found
to
flourish
best
in
free
states
and
when
the
rulers
have
possessed
genius
virtue
and
good
taste
the
most
eminent
era
of
grecian
architecture
was
when
the
athenian
republic
was
under
the
direction
of
pericles
at
this
period
also
existed
the
first
of
statuaries
praxiteles
where
that
eminent
artist
and
their
admirable
architects
were
employed
in
the
words
of
pausanius
rendered
the
whole
of
acropolis
as
an
entire
there
are
various
characteristic
distinctions
to
be
made
in
the
several
orders
of
architecture
which
distinguish
the
grecian
people
the
doric
is
eminent
for
primeval
simplicity
the
tuscan
embraces
more
ornament
the
ionic
unites
simplicity
and
elegance
but
the
sum
of
all
excellence
appears
to
be
united
in
the
corinthian
the
composite
is
also
a
most
elegant
order
but
appears
to
have
added
but
little
to
the
corinthian
elegance
and
majesty
various
nations
have
a
great
diversity
of
architecture
as
the
egyptian
persian
distinguished
by
human
figures
supporting
entablatures
hindostanee
arabasque
or
marisquo
which
are
very
peculiar
generally
having
the
walls
to
project
most
at
the
top
which
is
indicative
of
the
natural
jealousy
of
all
oriental
people
they
all
regarding
their
as
their
chief
treasure
it
appears
meant
for
their
especial
protection
a
greater
simplicity
does
not
appear
anywhere
than
in
the
architecture
of
the
druids
consisting
of
most
extensive
circles
of
immense
stones
chiefly
raised
perpendicularly
with
occasionally
a
larger
stone
placed
upon
the
apex
of
two
others
there
are
in
great
britain
numerous
remains
of
these
constructions
the
chief
are
stonehenge
near
salisbury
at
avebury
also
in
wiltshire
pomonca
in
the
orkneys
rollright
in
oxfordshire
but
the
most
eminent
spot
for
druid
temples
was
mona
in
anglesea
in
wales
the
reason
for
such
apparently
unmeaning
erections
will
be
found
in
their
peculiar
belief
in
the
religion
they
professed
the
saxon
is
a
very
heavy
order
of
architecture
it
was
used
in
this
kingdom
much
in
the
erection
of
religious
edifices
and
is
frequently
found
mixed
with
the
norman
in
such
structures
the
grand
and
most
obvious
distinction
is
a
arch
with
massy
columns
variously
ornamented
and
most
frequently
the
columns
which
support
the
same
arch
are
diversely
sculptured
the
chief
sculptures
of
this
kind
in
britain
are
gloucester
cathedral
malmesbury
abbey
wilts
sedbury
church
herefordshire
several
churches
in
rutland
lincoln
somerset
devon
and
other
counties
there
appears
to
us
to
be
no
order
of
architecture
better
calculated
for
the
purpose
to
which
it
is
generally
adopted
than
the
chaste
and
pure
norman
style
barbarously
denominated
gothic
it
affords
a
great
variety
of
light
airy
beauty
and
tasteful
grandeur
in
this
country
the
norman
order
succeeded
the
saxon
and
we
lost
nothing
by
the
exchange
for
even
now
that
we
have
the
entire
benefit
of
a
choice
of
the
purest
grecian
since
its
revival
by
inigo
jones
it
is
a
matter
of
taste
to
be
certain
but
in
our
estimation
the
chaste
norman
is
to
be
preferred
to
the
purest
grecian
for
the
purposes
for
which
it
is
intended
and
if
the
means
answer
the
ultimate
end
we
submit
this
to
be
the
proper
criterion
for
preference
we
find
it
usually
employed
in
religious
edifices
it
is
pure
light
airy
and
cheerful
and
we
are
of
opinion
that
the
service
of
gratitude
and
thanks
to
the
creator
demands
a
disposition
of
mind
which
these
feelings
are
best
calculated
to
inspire
domestic
architecture
is
various
and
chiefly
regulated
by
the
various
purposes
for
which
it
is
designed
its
characteristic
is
utility
see
frontispiece
it
appears
from
a
description
of
bridges
of
suspension
communicated
by
stephenson
civil
engineer
some
time
ago
to
the
journal
that
the
first
constructed
in
this
country
is
believed
to
be
one
over
the
tees
forming
a
communication
between
the
counties
of
durham
and
york
it
is
supposed
on
good
authority
to
have
been
erected
about
and
is
described
in
the
of
as
bridge
suspended
on
iron
chains
stretched
from
rock
to
rock
over
a
chasm
nearly
sixty
feet
deep
for
the
passage
of
travellers
particularly
miners
this
bridge
is
seventy
feet
in
length
and
little
more
than
two
feet
broad
with
a
on
one
side
and
planked
in
such
a
manner
that
the
traveller
experiences
all
the
tremulous
motion
of
the
chain
and
sees
himself
suspended
over
a
roaring
gulf
on
an
agitated
and
restless
gangway
to
which
few
strangers
dare
trust
in
two
or
three
bridges
of
iron
were
constructed
the
first
by
lees
an
extensive
woollen
manufacturer
at
galashiels
in
scotland
this
experiment
although
made
with
slender
wire
and
necessarily
imperfect
in
its
construction
deserves
to
be
noticed
as
affording
a
practical
example
of
the
tenacity
of
iron
so
these
wire
bridges
were
suspended
not
upon
the
catemarian
principle
so
successfully
adopted
in
the
larger
works
subsequently
undertaken
but
by
means
of
diagonal
braces
radiating
from
their
points
of
suspension
on
either
side
towards
the
centre
of
the
roadway
the
unfortunate
fabric
next
mentioned
was
constructed
on
this
defective
principle
among
the
earliest
practical
exhibitions
of
this
novel
architecture
in
the
united
kingdom
may
be
mentioned
the
uncommonly
elegant
and
light
which
was
thrown
over
the
tweed
at
dryburgh
in
by
the
earl
of
buchan
for
the
accommodation
of
foot
passengers
its
length
between
the
points
of
suspension
was
two
hundred
and
feet
being
considered
the
greatest
span
of
any
bridge
in
the
kingdom
this
useful
structure
the
theme
of
such
just
applause
and
which
harmonised
so
finely
with
the
scenery
of
dryburgh
abbey
was
entirely
destroyed
by
a
tremendous
gale
of
wind
at
the
beginning
of
the
year
following
its
this
bridge
was
subsequently
restored
upon
a
more
secure
system
clocks
the
invention
of
clocks
such
as
are
now
in
use
is
ascribed
to
pacificus
archdeacon
of
verona
who
died
in
but
they
were
not
known
in
england
before
the
year
they
were
ultimately
improved
by
the
application
of
pendulums
in
by
huygens
a
dutch
astronomer
and
mathematician
although
beckmann
differs
in
some
slight
degree
from
the
previous
relation
concerning
clocks
yet
he
says
is
sufficiently
apparent
that
clocks
moved
by
wheels
and
weights
began
certainly
to
be
used
in
the
monasteries
of
europe
about
the
eleventh
he
does
not
think
however
that
europe
has
a
claim
to
the
honour
of
the
invention
but
that
it
is
rather
to
be
ascribed
to
the
saracens
this
conjecture
he
confesses
is
chiefly
supported
by
what
trithemius
tells
us
of
one
which
was
sent
by
the
sultan
of
egypt
to
frederick
in
he
thinks
that
the
writers
of
that
century
speak
of
clocks
as
though
they
had
been
then
well
known
he
adds
that
in
the
fourteenth
century
mention
is
made
of
the
machine
of
richard
de
wallingford
which
has
hitherto
been
considered
as
the
oldest
clock
known
the
fabricator
of
this
machine
called
it
it
appears
that
clocks
had
been
hitherto
shut
up
in
monasteries
and
other
religious
houses
and
that
it
was
not
till
after
this
time
they
were
employed
for
more
general
purposes
as
the
convenience
of
cities
the
first
instance
on
record
that
has
been
yet
noticed
occurs
where
herbert
prince
of
carrara
caused
the
first
clock
that
was
ever
publicly
exposed
to
be
erected
at
padua
it
was
erected
by
john
dondi
whose
family
afterwards
in
consequence
had
the
pronomen
of
horologia
assigned
them
in
remembrance
of
this
circumstance
it
is
also
mentioned
on
the
tombstone
of
the
artist
the
family
of
dondi
now
followed
the
profession
of
manufacturing
clocks
for
his
son
john
dondi
constructed
one
upon
improved
principles
the
first
clock
at
bologna
was
put
up
in
the
year
some
time
after
the
year
charles
surnamed
the
wise
king
of
france
caused
a
clock
to
be
placed
in
the
tower
of
his
palace
by
henry
de
wyck
whom
he
had
invited
from
germany
for
the
purpose
because
there
was
then
at
paris
no
artist
of
that
kind
and
to
whom
he
assigned
a
salary
of
six
sols
per
diem
with
free
lodgings
in
the
tower
towards
the
end
of
that
century
probably
about
the
year
strasburg
had
a
clock
about
the
same
period
courtray
was
celebrated
for
its
clock
which
the
duke
of
burgundy
carried
away
a
public
clock
was
erected
in
the
altburg
gate
at
spire
in
the
works
of
which
cost
florins
the
greater
part
of
the
principal
cities
of
europe
however
at
this
period
had
clocks
without
striking
clocks
could
not
be
procured
but
at
a
very
great
expense
of
this
an
instance
occurred
in
the
city
of
auxerre
in
the
year
when
the
magistrates
being
desirous
of
a
clock
but
discovering
that
it
would
cost
more
money
than
they
thought
themselves
justified
in
expending
on
their
own
authority
applied
to
the
emperor
charles
viii
for
leave
to
employ
a
portion
of
the
public
funds
for
that
purpose
in
a
public
clock
was
put
up
in
the
church
of
the
virgin
mary
at
nuremberg
at
venice
a
public
clock
was
put
in
the
year
in
the
same
century
an
excellent
clock
was
put
up
for
cosmo
de
medici
by
lorenzo
a
florentine
having
thus
mentioned
their
origin
in
various
places
until
they
came
to
ornament
the
religious
houses
the
palaces
of
kings
and
the
chief
european
cities
it
now
remains
for
us
to
take
some
notice
of
their
existence
in
our
own
country
for
public
use
from
public
documents
still
extant
it
appears
that
so
great
was
their
expense
considered
in
those
early
times
of
their
introduction
that
it
was
only
the
powerful
and
the
rich
who
could
procure
them
we
discover
that
the
first
clock
for
public
and
lay
purposes
in
england
was
one
erected
on
the
north
side
of
old
palace
yard
westminster
on
which
was
this
inscription
justitiam
which
inscription
is
said
to
have
been
preserved
many
years
after
the
had
been
decayed
it
is
asserted
that
this
clock
was
placed
in
that
situation
for
the
purpose
of
being
heard
by
the
members
of
the
courts
of
law
and
the
occasion
which
produced
its
existence
is
thus
recorded
it
was
the
produce
of
a
fine
levied
upon
the
lord
chief
justice
of
the
court
of
bench
in
the
reign
of
edward
i
of
whom
it
appears
by
a
book
called
the
that
this
magistrate
had
been
fined
marks
for
making
an
alteration
in
a
record
wherein
a
defendant
had
been
fined
and
he
the
chief
justice
made
it
appear
to
be
instead
of
that
the
larger
sum
notoriety
however
was
attached
to
this
transaction
from
the
following
circumstances
first
it
appears
to
have
been
one
of
three
questions
put
by
richard
iii
to
his
judges
with
whom
he
was
closeted
in
the
inner
star
chamber
to
take
their
opinions
on
three
points
of
law
the
second
question
was
a
justice
of
the
peace
who
had
enrolled
an
indictment
which
had
been
negatived
by
the
grand
jury
among
the
true
bills
might
be
punished
for
the
abuse
of
his
office
on
this
question
a
diversity
of
opinion
arose
among
the
judges
some
of
whom
supposed
a
magistrate
could
not
be
prosecuted
for
what
he
might
have
done
whilst
others
contended
that
he
might
and
cited
the
case
of
the
lord
chief
justice
above
mentioned
so
far
was
the
answer
of
the
judges
strictly
proper
and
historically
true
the
third
circumstance
to
which
we
have
alluded
and
which
is
most
material
to
our
present
question
is
the
application
of
the
fine
it
appears
that
it
was
expended
in
the
construction
of
a
clock
which
was
erected
on
the
north
side
of
old
palace
yard
so
that
the
judges
barristers
and
students
could
not
enter
or
leave
the
court
without
having
an
opportunity
of
being
reminded
of
the
punishment
of
the
chief
justice
for
presuming
to
violate
the
impartial
duty
of
his
high
office
nor
could
they
even
hear
it
strike
whilst
upon
the
throne
of
justice
without
having
his
case
repeated
in
their
ears
thereby
acting
as
a
constant
remembrancer
intimating
they
were
to
administer
justice
more
than
mercy
sir
edward
coke
observes
that
marks
were
actually
entered
upon
the
roll
so
that
it
is
extremely
probable
he
had
himself
seen
the
record
this
clock
was
considered
so
important
during
the
reign
of
henry
that
we
find
that
the
king
gave
the
charge
of
keeping
it
with
its
appurtenances
to
william
warley
dean
of
with
the
pay
of
sixpence
per
diem
to
be
received
at
the
exchequer
the
clock
of
oxford
was
also
furnished
in
out
of
fines
imposed
upon
the
students
of
that
university
with
respect
to
the
clock
procured
from
the
fine
of
the
lord
chief
justice
we
must
also
observe
that
its
motto
appears
to
relate
to
that
circumstance
but
though
it
might
be
said
that
it
might
relate
to
a
dial
as
well
as
to
a
clock
a
material
observation
to
our
present
inquiry
yet
with
respect
to
its
present
absence
it
should
be
noticed
that
it
is
probable
that
clock
was
a
very
indifferent
one
but
from
its
antiquity
and
the
tradition
attending
it
was
permitted
to
remain
till
the
time
of
elizabeth
then
being
quite
decayed
a
dial
might
have
been
substituted
upon
the
same
bearing
the
very
singular
motto
which
however
originally
applied
clearly
alludes
to
such
a
circumstance
as
reported
of
the
lord
chief
justice
this
dial
is
placed
on
the
very
site
where
the
stood
but
it
is
said
by
derham
in
his
clockmaker
that
the
oldest
clock
in
this
kingdom
is
in
hampton
court
palace
marked
with
the
letters
presumed
to
have
been
the
initials
of
the
name
of
the
date
of
but
that
author
is
evidently
mistaken
in
alleging
that
to
be
the
oldest
because
the
oxford
clock
bears
a
date
seventeen
years
anterior
to
that
period
with
respect
to
the
initials
or
whatever
they
may
be
we
do
not
consider
them
of
the
smallest
importance
from
it
is
proved
that
the
ancient
name
of
this
instrument
was
horologe
which
various
passages
in
our
poets
and
old
authors
establish
watch
the
horologe
a
double
set
if
drink
rock
not
his
chaucer
also
says
of
a
cock
sickerer
was
his
crowing
in
his
loge
as
is
a
clock
or
any
abbey
which
tends
to
show
that
in
his
time
clocks
had
been
confined
to
religious
houses
so
prologue
to
the
story
of
thebes
will
myself
be
your
orologere
with
respect
to
our
modern
clocks
it
would
be
presumption
in
us
to
say
one
word
as
there
is
not
an
individual
but
knows
as
much
about
them
as
we
could
tell
him
we
have
fulfilled
our
intention
in
giving
this
historical
account
which
we
are
persuaded
will
afford
some
information
we
will
now
proceed
to
watches
which
are
not
of
so
great
antiquity
as
it
is
only
about
mention
is
made
of
watches
which
first
occurs
in
the
italian
poems
of
gaspar
visconti
dominico
maria
manni
says
the
inventor
was
lorenzo
a
vulparia
a
native
of
florence
one
might
naturally
be
inclined
to
believe
that
the
honour
of
original
invention
is
duly
demanded
by
the
whole
germanic
people
from
the
claim
of
the
invention
of
watches
being
aspired
to
by
the
nurembergians
as
doppelenayer
gravely
alleges
they
were
first
invented
by
a
person
residing
in
that
city
in
the
sixteenth
century
of
the
name
of
peter
hale
and
perhaps
he
has
no
better
foundation
for
his
conjecture
than
that
watches
were
at
first
of
an
oval
shape
and
were
called
nuremberg
eggs
shakspeare
in
his
night
speaking
of
a
has
the
following
expression
used
by
malvolio
frown
the
while
and
perchance
wind
up
my
watch
or
play
with
some
rich
also
the
priest
in
answer
to
olivia
when
my
hath
told
me
toward
my
grave
i
have
travelled
but
two
the
following
observations
appear
to
sanction
our
opinion
of
the
early
existence
of
those
machines
in
this
country
derham
in
his
clockmaker
published
in
mentions
a
watch
of
henry
which
at
the
period
he
wrote
was
in
good
order
indeed
demainbray
says
that
he
had
heard
sir
isaac
newton
and
demoire
both
speak
of
that
watch
an
anecdote
is
related
of
the
emperor
charles
contemporary
with
henry
which
it
appears
has
reference
to
the
policy
of
europe
at
that
day
it
is
said
the
emperor
after
dinner
used
to
sit
with
several
watches
on
the
table
with
his
bottle
in
the
centre
after
the
retirement
to
the
abbey
of
just
he
still
continued
to
amuse
himself
with
keeping
them
in
order
from
his
inability
to
effect
this
correctly
it
is
reported
he
drew
the
rational
reflection
it
was
impossible
to
effect
what
he
had
attempted
the
regulation
of
the
policy
of
it
also
appears
that
many
watches
of
that
day
struck
the
hours
the
of
report
that
such
watches
having
been
stolen
from
charles
and
louis
xi
whilst
they
were
in
a
crowd
the
thieves
were
detected
from
their
striking
it
also
appears
from
the
evidence
of
certain
watches
of
ancient
construction
formerly
held
by
sir
ashton
lever
and
also
by
ingham
forster
that
usually
supplied
the
place
of
a
chain
in
ancient
watches
also
that
they
were
of
a
smaller
size
than
now
made
and
generally
of
an
oval
form
imperfections
of
this
nature
and
probably
other
causes
might
have
rendered
their
truth
uncertain
and
this
most
probably
precluded
their
general
use
until
the
latter
end
of
the
reign
of
elizabeth
the
instances
we
have
shown
will
prove
they
were
generally
known
and
perhaps
used
at
the
time
of
shakspeare
writing
the
and
in
the
first
edition
of
furioso
published
in
the
frontispiece
represents
the
author
with
what
appears
to
be
a
watch
although
the
engraving
is
extremely
indistinct
moreover
the
inscription
to
which
engraving
of
tempo
clearly
indicates
the
same
thing
charles
in
incorporated
the
clockmakers
company
and
by
charter
which
prohibits
clocks
watches
and
alarums
from
being
imported
which
circumstance
proves
that
the
english
at
this
period
had
no
need
of
the
aid
of
foreign
ingenuity
in
this
branch
of
mechanism
we
are
told
that
guy
fawkes
and
percy
were
detected
in
the
third
year
of
james
with
a
watch
about
them
which
they
had
purchased
try
conclusions
for
the
long
and
short
burning
of
the
touchwood
in
the
words
of
the
time
which
was
prepared
to
give
fire
to
the
train
of
gunpowder
the
most
material
improvement
introduced
in
this
branch
of
mechanical
knowledge
took
place
in
the
addition
of
pendulums
by
huygens
as
applied
to
clocks
for
which
conception
he
was
indebted
to
galileo
which
that
philosopher
adopted
for
measuring
time
he
having
taken
the
idea
from
observing
the
vibrations
of
a
lamp
in
a
church
this
reign
also
boasts
of
the
production
of
in
england
first
fabricated
under
the
direction
of
the
celebrated
hook
and
manufactured
by
tompion
an
anecdote
is
related
of
the
attention
paid
to
watches
by
james
recorded
by
derham
in
the
clockmaker
one
barlow
had
procured
a
patent
in
conjunction
with
the
lord
chief
justice
allebone
for
repeaters
but
a
person
of
the
name
of
quare
making
one
at
the
same
time
upon
principles
he
had
entertained
before
the
patent
was
granted
to
barlow
the
king
tried
both
in
person
and
gave
the
preference
to
and
caused
it
to
be
notified
in
the
gazette
in
the
next
reign
the
reputation
of
british
watchmakers
had
increased
so
much
that
an
act
was
passed
by
parliament
enacting
that
watches
should
be
marked
with
the
name
in
order
to
preserve
the
reputation
of
this
branch
of
british
manufacture
from
coming
to
discredit
in
foreign
markets
thus
we
have
given
a
general
outline
of
the
history
of
this
branch
of
mechanics
for
a
period
of
nearly
a
thousand
years
from
the
first
invention
of
clocks
by
pacificus
of
verona
in
to
the
beginning
of
last
century
since
which
period
they
have
become
an
article
of
such
general
use
to
require
no
comment
from
us
we
have
noticed
the
various
improvements
in
the
order
in
which
they
occurred
among
which
the
most
striking
feature
appears
to
be
the
addition
of
the
pendulums
as
serving
to
regulate
the
motion
of
the
machine
from
its
given
length
certain
weight
and
uniform
vibration
it
must
be
conceived
to
have
been
a
happy
thought
in
galileo
for
the
admeasurement
of
time
and
its
application
to
this
branch
of
mechanics
was
no
less
fortunate
in
huygens
to
discover
the
first
invention
of
time
we
will
require
to
look
back
for
upwards
of
two
thousand
years
at
which
period
we
will
find
these
are
called
clepsydræ
vitruvius
the
roman
architect
and
mechanist
attributes
the
invention
of
the
to
ctesibus
of
alexandria
who
flourished
in
the
reign
of
ptolemy
euergetes
about
two
hundred
and
years
before
the
christian
era
the
same
author
says
the
machine
was
first
introduced
at
rome
two
hundred
and
fifty
seven
years
previous
to
the
christian
era
there
is
reason
to
believe
it
was
first
introduced
at
rome
into
courts
of
justice
from
greece
as
it
had
been
originally
used
in
greece
for
this
purpose
the
roman
orators
being
guided
in
the
time
they
occupied
the
court
by
this
instrument
as
we
may
learn
from
this
expression
of
cicero
ad
cicero
also
informs
us
that
it
was
first
introduced
into
courts
of
justice
in
the
third
consulate
of
pompey
it
has
been
discovered
that
the
inventions
of
egypt
chaldea
and
other
oriental
countries
constantly
travelled
to
rome
and
the
west
long
since
the
respective
periods
previously
mentioned
has
the
honour
of
this
invention
been
claimed
by
burgundians
bolognese
and
other
italians
sometimes
by
frenchmen
but
chiefly
by
germans
their
claim
for
invention
seems
to
be
questionable
in
numerous
instances
whatever
it
may
be
for
improvement
they
certainly
can
not
consistently
with
what
we
have
stated
be
considered
as
the
inventors
although
there
is
nothing
to
be
alleged
against
these
respective
people
being
the
discoverers
of
designs
which
had
a
previous
existence
unknown
to
them
with
equal
or
much
more
propriety
might
the
arabians
in
point
of
time
could
that
be
of
consequence
be
considered
as
inventors
of
this
machine
and
they
are
well
known
to
possess
the
least
claim
to
original
invention
of
any
people
they
however
have
a
merit
notwithstanding
but
it
is
of
a
negative
kind
for
those
arts
sciences
which
were
by
chance
saved
from
the
destruction
of
their
bigoted
ignorance
and
which
when
the
fortune
of
war
had
thrown
into
their
hands
those
pure
designs
of
intellectual
greece
mere
accident
had
wrested
from
their
zealous
fury
these
they
transmitted
to
a
more
ingenious
people
as
pure
as
they
had
received
them
but
upon
precisely
as
good
grounds
as
the
europeans
claimed
this
invention
might
the
arabians
have
assumed
that
honour
for
we
read
that
haroun
al
raschid
caliph
of
bagdad
then
the
chief
of
the
saracen
empire
sent
as
a
present
to
charlemagne
a
clock
of
curious
workmanship
which
was
put
into
motion
by
a
clepsydra
which
instrument
is
said
by
adams
have
been
used
by
the
ancients
to
measure
time
by
water
running
out
of
a
it
consists
of
a
cylinder
divided
into
small
cells
and
suspended
by
a
thread
fixed
to
its
axis
in
a
frame
on

had

has
acquired

thus
described
by
the
same
author
from
one
in
his
own
possession
the
newest
improvements
added
to
this
machine
may
be
reckoned
an
alarum
which
consists
of
a
bell
and
small
wheels
like
that
of
a
clock
that
strikes

screwed
to
the

of
the

in
which
the

is
suspended

axis
of
the

at

when
one
is
desirous
of
being
awakened
pushes
down
a
small
crank
which
by
letting
fall
a
weight
puts
the
alarum
in
motion
a
dial
plate
with
a
handle
is
also
placed
over
the
in
respect
to
the
invention
of
clepsydræ
we
should
think
the
original
inventor
took
his
first
idea
from
the
use
of
an
instrument
common
in
egypt
which
that
people
called
a
or
nilometer
being
a
large
stone
vessel
of
the
shape
of
a
sarcophagus
into
which
water
was
daily
poured
by
proper
officers
during
the
increase
of
the
nile
to
show
the
people
whether
they
had
a
prospect
of
plenty
or
were
to
expect
a
scarcity
in
the
ensuing
year
as
the
fall
of
the
water
after
it
had
risen
to
a
due
height
was
of
equal
importance
to
them
so
the
water
was
suffered
to
run
out
proportionably
to
its
decrease
in
the
river
being
ascertained
by
just
and
equal
marks
which
they
generally
well
understood
had
also
been
invented
to
describe
the
progress
of
time
these
were
conical
in
which
were
placed
a
portion
of
sand
the
glasses
were
joined
together
at
the
apex
of
the
cone
with
a
small
aperture
of
communication
between
the
from
the
glass
in
which
the
sand
is
deposited
it
dropped
grain
by
grain
into
the
sand
below
standing
upon
its
flat
basis
these
machines
are
called
and
well
known
we
have
been
unable
to
discover
any
account
of
the
origin
of
this
instrument
but
from
its
simplicity
it
admits
of
no
improvement
it
is
also
believed
this
had
its
origin
in
a
convent
spinning
the
necessity
for
human
clothing
must
be
so
obvious
we
should
think
at
nearly
the
first
existence
of
our
race
that
two
opinions
upon
that
subject
can
not
exist
for
admitting
the
region
where
our
first
parents
were
stationed
was
more
genial
to
life
than
these
our
northern
countries
yet
the
difference
in
temperature
between
the
heat
of
and
the
chilly
damps
of
night
must
be
obvious
to
every
one
who
has
resided
in
or
has
read
of
tropical
climates
therefore
from
necessity
we
contend
our
first
parents
could
not
have
dispensed
with
the
benefit
of
clothing
however
independent
of
the
necessity
of
the
thing
the
jewish
history
informs
us
that
the
first
man
adam
and
his
wife
in
consequence
of
their
unfortunate
disobedience
and
positive
violation
of
the
commands
of
their
divine
creator
knew
of
their
own
nakedness
and
therefore
they
were
ashamed
to
answer
to
the
sacred
summons
this
they
confessed
with
a
simplicity
congenial
to
truth
and
in
the
same
moment
frankly
owned
the
cause
answering
to
the
awful
interrogatory
of
told
thee
that
thou
wast
naked
hast
thou
eaten
of
the
tree
whereof
i
commanded
thee
that
thou
shouldest
not
eat
woman
whom
thou
gavest
to
be
with
me
she
gave
me
of
the
tree
and
i
did
however
we
are
previously
informed
that
eyes
of
them
both
were
opened
and
they
knew
that
they
were
naked
and
they
sewed
together
and
made
themselves
it
should
be
observed
that
the
leaf
of
the
banyan
or
indian
fig
is
probably
here
meant
if
it
is
the
luxurious
leaf
of
this
tree
is
about
three
feet
long
and
proportionably
wide
therefore
we
may
rationally
conclude
much
art
was
not
required
probably
a
thorn
might
supply
the
place
of
a
needle
and
a
blade
of
grass
would
do
for
a
thread
afterwards
we
are
told
in
the
same
chapter
adam
also
to
his
wife
did
the
lord
jehovah
make
coats
of
skins
and
clothed
the
preceding
is
the
earliest
account
of
humanity
at
the
same
time
it
also
furnishes
the
most
ancient
relation
of
the
original
of
human
clothing
from
hieroglyphical
inscriptions
still
extant
the
most
ancient
inhabitants
of
egypt
wore
sometimes
clothing
made
of
feathers
fastened
together
sometimes
of
shells
also
attached
to
each
other
but
the
most
general
ancient
clothing
consisted
of
the
skins
of
various
animals
so
is
hercules
and
many
of
the
heroes
clothed
in
antique
statuary
although
the
sacred
history
is
silent
on
this
head
we
may
perhaps
by
inference
arrive
at
some
clue
or
thread
to
guide
us
through
the
labyrinth
of
uncertainty
accordingly
we
find
in
the
first
passages
which
will
admit
of
constructive
inference
that
thread
of
some
sort
must
of
necessity
have
had
existence
ada
bare
jubal
he
was
the
father
of
such
as
dwell
in
and
of
such
as
have
gen
now
we
submit
the
inference
of
not
only
spinning
but
also
of
weaving
and
even
sewing
must
be
conceded
before
we
can
conceive
the
existence
of
tents
the
cloth
whereof
they
were
made
at
that
period
it
is
probable
was
of
the
fleece
of
sheep
because
of
the
early
existence
of
woollen
cloth
among
the
greeks
we
have
no
doubt
from
the
following
and
numerous
other
passages
in
their
poets
and
also
from
the
practice
of
tyrian
artisans
who
were
we
know
generally
and
confessedly
eminent
for
their
dying
the
imperial
purple
and
other
scarce
valuable
and
beautiful
colours
and
no
substance
better
receives
or
so
well
retains
the
most
splendid
of
colours
than
does
wool
but
homer
speaks
expressively
in
point
where
in
his
he
expresses
the
truce
which
took
place
between
the
belligerent
armies
of
greeks
and
trojans
after
the
defeat
of
paris
by
menelaus
and
where
the
goddess
venus
is
said
to
have
rescued
her
favourite
from
the
fate
he
deserved
to
find
after
she
had
conveyed
the
recreant
hero
from
the
field
to
his
apartment
she
then
like
a
true
friend
to
matrimonial
infidelity
goes
in
search
of
the
spartan
queen
for
the
purpose
of
bringing
the
lovers
together
she
discovered
the
beautiful
adultress
on
the
walls
of
the
city
where
she
had
been
describing
to
priam
and
his
ancient
nobles
the
trojan
councillors
the
various
persons
of
the
heroes
of
greece
upon
this
occasion
venus
to
use
the
language
of
the
poet
as
translated
by
pope
assumes
a
disguise
her
beset
by
trojan
beauties
came
in
borrowed
form
the
dame
she
seemed
an
ancient
maid
well
to
cull
the
snowy
fleece
and
wind
the
twisted
the
labours
of
penelope
helena
herself
and
innumerable
passages
in
the
works
of
the
poet
all
tend
to
confirm
the
fact
that
had
also
an
early
existence
is
proved
at
a
very
anterior
period
of
the
jewish
history
they
had
even
fine
linen
previous
to
the
construction
of
the
utensils
used
in
sacred
worship
as
in
exodus
an
ephod
of
linen
is
expressly
mentioned
likewise
in
the
xxvth
chapter
verse
of
that
book
fine
linen
is
expressly
enumerated
among
those
presents
that
the
people
were
expected
to
offer
freely
to
the
lord
jehovah
whence
we
are
justified
in
inferring
they
had
most
probably
learned
in
egypt
to
carry
its
structure
to
great
perfection
we
have
linen
mentioned
likewise
in
homer
upon
the
breach
of
the
truce
between
the
grecians
and
trojans
with
their
auxiliary
forces
on
menelaus
having
been
wounded
by
an
arrow
from
the
bow
of
pandarus
where
the
poet
sweetly
sings
thee
atrides

that
dangerous
hour

gods
forgot
not
nor

guardian

golden

double
corslet

hissing
from
above
passed
the
broad
belt
and
through
the
corslet

folds

plaited

and
the
skin
and
drew
the
purple
from
what
appears
in
the
subsequent
as
well
as
the
former
part
of
this
article
we
submit
that
the
general
manufacture
of
cloth
both
woollen
and
linen
has
been
established
and
if
this
is
made
out
the
prior
existence
of
the
other
subsidiary
arts
of
spinning
weaving
can
not
be
denied
there
are
hieroglyphical
symbols
in
the
british
museum
which
denote
the
various
operations
of
the
manufacture
of
cloths
and
upon
a
monument
upwards
of
three
thousand
six
hundred
years
old
numerous
arts
have
been
discovered
by
mere
accident
we
are
told
the
very
valuable
operation
of
was
discovered
by
a
british
sovereign
whose
feet
being
always
cold
in
the
winter
he
had
wool
put
into
his
shoes
the
moisture
there
contracted
the
natural
heat
of
the
body
with
the
action
to
which
this
wool
was
exposed
between
the
foot
and
the
shoe
caused
the
fleecy
substance
to
consolidate
whence
the
origin
of
that
very
necessary
article
the
stocking
manufacture
the
invention
to
which
this
article
refers
affords
a
warm
subject
for
panegyric
that
clothing
for
the
feet
be
warm
medical
writers
have
in
all
ages
recommended
and
truly
upon
the
most
rational
as
well
as
philosophic
and
experimental
practice
the
feet
lying
the
most
remote
of
any
member
from
the
heart
require
and
particularly
by
people
in
years
to
be
kept
warm
in
order
for
their
present
comfort
as
well
as
to
promote
the
essential
evacuation
of
superfluous
humours
by
perspiration
without
which
no
frame
can
be
healthy
so
strongly
is
this
precept
impressed
in
our
national
moral
habits
that
it
has
formed
a
general
maxim
for
the
preservation
of
health
even
thomas
parr
is
said
to
have
observed
upon
being
asked
to
what
cause
he
attributed
the
protraction
of
his
life
keep
the
head
cool
by
temperance
and
the
feet
warm
by
exercise
to
eat
only
when
hunger
required
satisfaction
and
to
drink
only
when
we
should
suppose
that
this
recipe
would
be
at
least
worth
a
waggon
load
of
the
puffed
quack
pills
which
are
palmed
upon
the
public
as
made
from
a
recipe
left
by
that
venerable
man
the
art
of
knitting
nets
is
one
of
great
antiquity
as
those
nets
used
by
the
hebrews
as
well
as
by
the
greeks
are
conceived
to
be
similar
to
those
used
in
the
present
day
it
was
thought
by
ovid
in
his
sixth
that
the
public
were
indebted
to
the
spider
for
the
origin
of
this
ingenious
invention
which
would
indeed
seem
probable
as
it
appears
that
the
insect
is
prompted
to
be
thus
ingenious
for
the
gratification
of
its
natural
wants
the
web
serving
as
a
net
or
gin
for
the
capture
of
flies
and
other
small
insects
which
supply
it
with
food
and
if
our
memory
serve
us
we
recollect
that
the
poet
also
speaking
of
flies
observes
that
the
web
of
the
spider
serves
to
secure
the
weak
flies
only
whilst
the
strong
break
it
and
escape
alluding
to
the
influence
of
wealth
and
power
to
pierce
through
those
laws
which
were
made
for
the
protection
of
the
weak
against
the
encroachments
and
violence
offered
by
the
strong
the
author
of
job
in
the
eighteenth
chapter
and
ninth
verse
mentions
gins
however
in
knitting
stockings
the
operation
as
well
as
the
effect
is
essentially
different
from
knitting
nets
in
the
latter
the
twine
is
knotted
into
distinct
meshes
which
are
secured
by
knots
in
the
former
the
entire
substance
is
produced
without
knots
to
this
distinction
is
to
be
ascribed
the
reason
why
knit
stockings
may
become
unravelled
in
the
other
species
the
knots
not
only
prevent
the
material
being
taken
apart
but
they
also
render
the
nets
sufficiently
strong
to
prevent
even
vigorous
fish
from
escaping
yet
being
so
capacious
as
to
permit
little
fish
to
escape
with
the
water
the
art
of
knitting
is
not
now
by
any
means
so
general
as
it
was
formerly
it
then
unquestionably
rated
among
the
number
of
female
accomplishments
and
it
is
certainly
rather
wonderful
because
when
the
mechanism
is
once
obtained
it
requires
no
exertion
of
intellect
to
practise
it
it
may
be
carried
on
while
sitting
walking
and
talking
or
in
almost
every
situation
to
which
ordinary
life
is
called
and
when
it
is
considered
that
its
produce
adds
to
the
comfort
of
the
indigent
to
the
advantage
of
the
poor
and
that
to
persons
in
easy
circumstances
habitual
industry
increases
their
happiness
these
things
considered
it
is
with
wonder
and
regret
we
see
it
fallen
into
disuse
particularly
as
it
is
an
occupation
suited
to
every
age
and
capacity
which
the
infant
is
strong
enough
to
practise
and
even
in
the
infirmity
and
weakness
of
age
it
is
practicable
we
certainly
do
hope
and
trust
these
observations
may
invite
the
attention
of
those
meritorious
individuals
who
have
the
direction
and
management
of
our
scholastic
establishments
to
revive
the
practice
fishing
nets
are
also
in
use
among
the
most
barbarous
nations
of
this
period
as
various
navigators
have
satisfactorily
proved
frequently
made
of
rude
materials
it
is
true
some
of
the
bark
of
trees
and
others
of
the
beards
of
whales
besides
a
variety
of
other
articles
which
the
more
refined
inhabitants
of
civilised
countries
would
never
think
of
using
for
such
a
purpose
the
art
of
making
nets
or
ornaments
of
fine
yarn
is
said
not
to
be
a
modern
invention
it
having
been
practised
for
hangings
and
articles
of
dress
and
ornament
in
the
middle
ages
it
appears
the
clergy
wore
netting
of
silk
over
their
clerical
robes
professor
beckmann
also
says
he
suspects
those
transparent
dresses
were
used
by
ladies
more
than
four
hundred
years
ago
to
cover
those
beauties
they
still
wish
to
be
visible
the
invention
for
making
coverings
for
the
legs
of
this
manufacture
is
we
understand
of
much
later
invention
it
is
well
known
that
the
romans
and
the
ancient
nations
had
no
particular
covering
for
their
legs
indeed
the
necessity
was
not
so
urgent
with
the
inhabitants
of
warm
climates
as
with
those
in
our
northern
regions
who
we
find
generally
covered
not
only
the
feet
but
the
legs
thighs
and
loins
with
the
same
garment
such
there
is
reason
to
conclude
were
the
trews
or
trowsers
anciently
worn
by
the
scotch
but
not
knit
hose
which
the
following
lines
from
an
old
song
will
help
to
prove
days
whan
gude
king
robert
rang
his
trews
they
cost
but
half
a
croun
he
said
they
were
a
groat
dear
and
the
tailor
thief
and
a
celebrated
author
on
antiquities
says
is
probable
the
art
of
knitting
stockings
was
first
found
out
in
the
sixteenth
century
but
the
time
of
the
invention
is
he
continues
appears
to
have
been
the
first
person
who
hazarded
a
conjecture
that
this
art
is
a
scottish
invention
because
when
the
french
became
so
numerous
as
to
form
a
guild
they
made
choice
of
fiacre
a
native
of
scotland
to
be
their
patron
and
besides
this
there
is
a
tradition
that
the
first
knit
stockings
were
brought
to
france
from
that
this
fiacre
it
appears
was
the
son
of
eugenius
said
to
have
been
a
scottish
king
in
the
seventh
century
and
fiacre
lived
as
a
hermit
at
meaux
in
france
in
the
roman
calendar
his
name
is
opposite
to
the
of
august
more
probable
however
is
the
opinion
in
this
country
which
respectable
writers
support
among
them
we
are
informed
by
the
author
of
the
of
the
world
that
henry
who
reigned
from
to
and
who
was
fond
of
show
and
magnificence
at
first
wore
woollen
stockings
till
by
a
singular
occurrence
he
received
a
pair
of
silk
knit
stockings
from
spain
his
son
edward
who
succeeded
him
on
the
throne
obtained
by
means
of
his
merchant
thomas
gresham
a
pair
of
long
spanish
knit
silk
stockings
this
present
was
at
that
time
highly
prized
queen
elizabeth
in
the
third
year
of
her
reign
received
by
her
named
montague
a
pair
of
knit
silk
stockings
and
afterwards
refused
to
wear
any
other
kind
stowe
also
relates
in
his
chronicle
of
england
that
the
earl
of
pembroke
was
the
first
nobleman
who
wore
worsted
knit
stockings
in
the
year
william
ridor
an
apprentice
of
master
thomas
burdet
having
accidentally
seen
in
the
shop
of
an
italian
merchant
a
pair
of
knit
worsted
stockings
procured
from
mantua
having
borrowed
them
made
a
pair
exactly
like
them
these
were
the
first
stockings
that
were
knit
in
england
from
woollen
yarn
from
this
it
would
appear
that
knit
stockings
were
first
introduced
into
england
in
the
reign
of
henry
and
that
they
were
brought
from
spain
to
this
country
and
probability
appears
to
favour
the
belief
that
they
were
originally
the
produce
of
either
that
country
or
italy
should
this
be
the
case
it
has
been
conceived
by
professor
beckmann
that
they
came
originally
from
arabia
to
spain
the
investigation
with
respect
to
the
feigned
productions
of
rowley
published
by
the
unfortunate
thomas
chatterton
arose
from
the
mention
of
knitting
in
a
passage
of
those
poems
it
being
contended
that
knit
hose
were
unknown
in
the
days
of
rowley
the
passage
alluded
to
occurs
in
the
tragedy
of
sayde
as
herr
whytte
hands
whytte
hosen

knyttinge
whatte
pleasure
ytt
ys
to
be

a
like
ordeal
took
place
with
respect
to
ossian
from
a
similar
reason
the
mention
of
the
reflection
setting
on
a
glass
window
now
the
existence
of
ossian
being
contemporary
with
that
of
julius
cæsar
it
was
contended
that
at
that
period
it
was
not
customary
to
glaze
windows
the
johnsonian
faction
set
about
that
business
in
a
very
unsystematic
manner
they
should
have
procured
some
well
qualified
erse
scholar
to
have
gone
into
those
wilds
where
macpherson
declared
he
collected
his
materials
from
oral
traditionary
recitals
and
have
heard
the
poems
themselves
from
the
mouths
of
the
aged
inhabitants
if
the
traces
of
them
could
not
have
been
found
they
might
then
have
ascribed
the
superior
honour
to
macpherson
of
writing
a
work
that
greece
or
rome
in
the
splendour
of
literary
glory
never
surpassed
for
many
poetical
beauties
the
people
of
scotland
in
the
beginning
of
the
sixteenth
century
had
in
the
proper
sense
of
the
word
breeches
and
wore
a
kind
of
stockings
their
hose
coming
only
to
the
knees
their
stockings
were
made
of
linen
or
woollen
and
breeches
of
hemp
it
is
supposed
that
these
particular
articles
of
dress
were
also
common
in
england
at
and
after
that
time
for
in
the
year
henry
viii
appeared
upon
a
public
occasion
with
his
attendants
in
dresses
of
the
following
description
king
and
some
of
the
gentlemen
had
the
upper
parts
of
their
hosen
which
was
of
blue
and
crimson
powdered
with
castels
and
sheafes
of
arrows
of
fine
ducket
gold
and
the
nether
parts
of
scarlet
powdered
with
timbrels
there
may
be
occasion
to
suppose
the
upper
parts
of
the
hose
were
in
separate
pieces
as
they
were
of
different
colours
hollinshed
also
speaking
of
another
festival
says
garments
of
six
of
them
were
of
strange
cuts
every
cut
with
points
of
gold
and
tassels
of
the
same
their
hosen
cut
in
and
tied
in
the
word
appears
to
have
been
quite
common
in
england
for
john
palsgrave
a
french
master
to
the
princess
mary
daughter
of
henry
published
a
grammar
in
which
he
stated
that
this
word
in
french
was
applied
to
the
making
of
nets
as
well
as
of
caps
and
of
stockings
in
the
household
book
of
a
noble
family
in
the

of
henry

during
the
life
of
sir
thomas
knight
of

his
lady
ann
daughter
of

vaux
there
are
the

whence
the

of

at
that
period
are
ascertained

i
it
is
observed
that
the
first
four
pairs
were
for
sir
thomas
and
the
latter
for
his
children
nevertheless
in
the
reign
of
mary
many
wore
cloth
hose
as
is
evidenced
in
the
following
anecdote
of
sands
who
was
afterwards
archbishop
of
york
being
in
the
tower
he
had
permission
for
a
tailor
to
come
and
take
an
order
for
a
pair
of
hose
this
serves
to
prove
the
veracity
of
stowe
that
stockings
were
not
an
article
manufactured
in
england
generally
we
suppose
till
six
years
afterwards
sands
on
his
going
to
bed
in
house
he
had
a
paire
of
hose
newlie
made
that
were
too
long
for
him
for
while
he
was
in
the
tower
a
tailor
was
admitted
to
make
him
a
pair
of
hose
one
came
into
him
whose
name
was
beniamin
dwelling
in
birchin
lane
he
might
not
speak
to
him
or
come
to
him
to
take
measure
of
him
but
onelie
to
look
upon
his
leg
he
made
the
hose
and
they
were
two
inches
too
long
these
hose
he
praied
the
good
wife
of
the
house
to
send
to
some
tailor
to
cut
his
hose
two
inches
shorter
the
wife
required
the
boy
of
the
house
to
carrie
them
to
the
next
tailor
which
was
beniamin
that
made
them
the
boy
required
him
to
cut
the
hose
he
said

saith
the

ye

and
my

took
the

of
any
beneficed

to
his
best

must
have
become
common
for
harrison
in
his
description
of
the
indigenous
produce
of
this
island
says
the
bark
of
the
alder
tree
was
used
by
the
wives
for
dying
stockings
which
they
had
knitted
hollinshed
also
informs
us
that
about
when
queen
elizabeth
was
at
norwich
the
stage
there
stood
at
one
end
eight
small
women
children
spinning
worsted
yarn
and
at
the
other
end
as
many
knitting
worsted
yarn
into
silk
stockings
are
said
in
consequence
of
their
high
price
for
a
long
time
to
have
been
worn
only
upon
grand
occasions
henry
ii
of
france
wore
them
for
the
first
time
on
the
marriage
of
his
sister
with
the
duke
of
savoy
in
the
year
in
the
reign
of
henry
iii
who
ascended
the
throne
in
the
consort
of
geoffroy
camus
de
pontcarre
who
held
a
high
office
in
the
state
would
not
wear
silk
stockings
given
to
her
by
a
nurse
who
lived
at
court
because
she
considered
them
to
be
too
gay
anno
when
the
barthold
von
mandelsoh
who
had
been
envoy
to
many
diets
and
courts
appeared
on
a
with
silk
stockings
which
he
had
brought
from
italy
the
margrave
john
of
austria
said
to
him
i
have
silk
stockings
also
but
i
wear
them
only
on
sundays
and
the
knitting
stockings
with
wires
called
has
been
thought
to
bear
a
resemblance
to
the
wire
work
in
screens
of
churches
however
the
invention
of
the
stocking
loom
is
thought
more
worthy
of
attention
because
it
is
alleged
to
have
been
the
production
of
a
single
person
and
perfected
at
one
trial
his
name
and
the
exact
period
is
ascertained
and
because
it
is
founded
upon
a
similar
incident
to
that
of
the
beauteous
corinthian
maid
elsewhere
mentioned
as
the
introducer
of
painting
in
greece
we
bestow
a
particular
attention
upon
this
incident
which
produced
the
stocking
loom
trusting
our
fair
readers
will
favour
us
with
their
attention
when
they
are
informed
it
is
ascribed
to
love
it
is
a
complicated
piece
of
machinery
consisting
of
no
fewer
than
two
thousand
pieces
it
could
not
have
been
discovered
accidentally
but
must
have
been
the
result
of
deep
combination
and
profound
sagacity
under
the
usurpation
of
cromwell
the
of
london
presented
a
petition
requesting
permission
to
establish
a
guild
in
this
petition
they
gave
a
circumstantial
account
of
their
profession
of
its
rise
progress
and
importance
no
doubt
can
exist
but
that
in
this
document
the
petitioners
rendered
the
best
and
probably
a
true
account
of
the
origin
and
progress
of
their
trade
that
of
stocking
weaving
being
then
scarcely
fifty
years
old
the
circumstances
they
stated
being
then
within
memory
any
misrepresentation
would
have
militated
against
them
and
could
have
been
easily
contradicted
in
account
of
nottingham
this
petition
is
found
in
that
town
the
loom
was
first
employed
where
it
has
given
wealth
to
many
from
this
account
it
appears
the
name
was
william
lee
a
native
of
woodborough
a
village
about
seven
miles
distant
from
nottingham
in
which
the
following
passage
occurs
trade
is
properly
styled
frame
because
it
is
direct
and
absolute
in
the
stitches
thereof
nothing
different
therein
from
the
common
way
of
knitting
not
much
more
anciently
for
public
use
practised
in
this
nation
than
this
but
only
in
the
number
of
needles
at
an
instant
working
in
this
more
than
in
the
other
by
a
hundred
for
one
set
in
an
engine
or
frame
composed
of
above
two
thousand
pieces
of
and
work
after
so
artificial
and
exact
a
manner
that
by
the
judgment
of
all
beholders
it
far
excels
in
the
ingenuity
curiosity
and
subtility
of
the
invention
and
contexture
all
other
frames
or
instruments
of
manufacture
in
use
in
any
known
part
of
the
the
inventor
of
this
ingenious
machine
was
heir
to
a
considerable
freehold
estate
and
a
graduate
of
college
cambridge
being
it
is
said
deeply
enamoured
of
a
lovely
young
who
during
his
frequent
visits
paid
more
attention
to
her
work
which
was
knitting
than
to
her
lover
or
his
proposals
he
endeavoured
to
find
out
a
machine
which
might
facilitate
and
forward
the
operation
of
knitting
and
by
these
means
afford
more
leisure
to
the
object
of
his
affections
to
converse
with
him
love
indeed
is
confessed
to
be
fertile
in
inventions
and
has
been
the
efficient
passion
which
has
perfected
many
inventions
for
which
the
gratitude
of
the
world
is
due
but
a
machine
so
complex
so
wonderful
in
its
effects
would
seem
to
require
a
longer
time
than
was
probably
allowed
and
a
cooler
judgment
than
a
to
construct
such
mechanism
but
even
should
the
cause
appear
problematical
there
can
not
exist
a
doubt
but
the
real
inventor
was
william
lee
of
woodborough
in
nottinghamshire
deering
says
expressly
that
lee
made
the
first
in
the
year
this
account
has
also
been
adopted
by
various
english
writers
in
the
hall
london
is
an
old
painting
in
which
lee
is
represented
pointing
out
his
loom
to
a
female
knitter
who
is
standing
near
him
and
below
is
seen
an
inscription
with
the
date
the
period
of
the
invention
ingenious
william
lee
master
of
arts
of
college
cambridge
devised
this
profitable
art
for
stockings
but
being
despised
went
to
france
yet
of
iron
to
himself
but
to
us
and
others
of
gold
in
memory
of
whom
this
is
here
lee
set
up
an
establishment
at
calverton
a
village
five
miles
from
nottingham
but
met
with
no
success
in
this
situation
he
showed
his
work
to
queen
elizabeth
from
that
princess
he
requested
some
assistance
his
work
having
embarrassed
rather
than
assisted
him
but
instead
of
meeting
with
that
remuneration
to
which
his
genius
and
invention
so
well
entitled
him
he
was
discouraged
and
discountenanced
it
need
not
therefore
excite
surprise
that
lee
accepted
the
invitation
of
henry
iv
of
france
who
having
heard
of
the
invention
promised
him
a
magnificent
reward
if
he
would
carry
it
to
france
he
took
nine
journeymen
and
several
looms
to
rouen
where
he
worked
with
much
approbation
but
the
king
being
shortly
after
assassinated
and
internal
commotions
taking
place
the
concern
got
into
difficulties
and
lee
died
in
poverty
at
paris
a
knowledge
of
the
machine
was
brought
back
to
england
by
some
of
the
workmen
who
had
emigrated
with
lee
and
who
established
themselves
in
nottinghamshire
which
still
continues
the
principal
seat
of
the
manufacture
during
the
first
century
after
the
invention
of
the
few
improvements
were
made
upon
it
and
two
men
were
usually
employed
to
work
one
frame
but
in
the
course
of
last
century
the
machine
was
very
greatly
improved
the
late
ingenious
jedediah
strut
of
belper
derbyshire
was
the
first
individual
who
succeeded
in
adapting
it
to
the
manufacture
of
stockings
estimating
the
population
of
great
britain
say
sixteen
millions
and
the
average
annual
expenditure
of
each
individual
upon
stockings
and
knit
gloves
at
five
shillings
the
total
value
of
the
manufacture
will
be
and
we
consider
this
rather
to
be
under
than
over
the
mark
the
effect
of
this
invention
was
very
late
in
making
its
appearance
in
scotland
till
far
on
in
the
eighteenth
century
the
use
of
knitted
stockings
was
universal
mittens
or
woollen
gloves
for
the
hands
and
for
drawing
over
the
legs
in
riding
were
also
quite
common
and
all
were
wrought
by
the
hand
the
manufacture
was
carried
on
solely
by
women
the
wives
and
daughters
of
farmers
generally
and
the
produce
was
sold
as
the
means
of
bringing
in
a
small
revenue
the
introduction
of
the
to
hawick
in
and
the
change
of
manners
which
took
place
about
this
period
soon
put
an
end
to
this
traffic
but
still
the
greater
part
of
the
stockings
worn
by
the
country
people
on
ordinary
occasions
are
knitted
at
home
the
art
is
also
still
in
use
in
shetland
where
knitting
forms
the
only
amusement
to
relieve
the
tedium
of
a
long
winter
and
where
the
articles
produced
are
exceedingly
fine
in
the
texture
the
shetland
hose
bring
the
highest
price
of
any
woollen
stocking
coaches
coach
is
said
to
be
derived
from
italian
a
term
first
used
in
the
eleventh
century
and
invented
to
designate
a
military
machine
so
called
we
intend
the
word
coaches
to
stand
for
the
generic
name
of
all
those
machines
used
for
the
carriage
of
persons
on
business
or
pleasure
except
indeed
those
for
the
conveyance
of
the
dead
from
the
state
carriage
of
the
sovereign
down
to
the
humble
gig
the
original
inventor
of
this
species
of
carriage
is
said
to
have
been
an
athenian
monarch
years
before
christ
who
being
afflicted
with
lameness
in
his
feet
first
invented
a
coach
for
his
convenience
and
with
a
view
to
conceal
his
debility
this
may
be
regarded
as
the
first
original
of
the
kind
of
grecian
invention
the
ancient
historian
diodorus
siculus
makes
mention
of
a
carriage
in
which
sesostris
was
wont
to
be
drawn
and
also
he
says
when
he
entered
the
city
or
went
out
to
the
sacrifice
had
four
of
his
captive
kings
yoked
to
his
chariot
but
it
is
conjectured
this
carriage
to
which
that
historian
alludes
was
a
car
there
is
most
assuredly
ample
room
to
believe
that
this
was
the
first
species
of
carriage
which
was
introduced
if
so
those
existed
long
before
the
athenian
king
because
all
the
homeric
heroes
greeks
as
well
as
trojans
and
their
auxiliaries
rode
in
these
machines
called
chariots
or
cars
which
are
also
known
to
have
existed
long
antecedent
to
that
period
we
remain
assured
that
war
chariots
were
used
in
the
first
ages
of
the
world
by
all
the
great
monarchs
who
possessed
dominion
that
species
of
carriage
before
said
to
have
been
invented
by
the
athenian
monarch
we
therefore
presume
was
a
covered
carriage
similar
to
that
species
designated
in
the
twelve
tables
of
the
roman
law
and
by
them

was
said
to
be
a
carriage
of
the
last
presumed
description
and
mentioned
as
being
intended
for
the
conveyance
of
the
infirm
to
this
species
of
carriage
succeeded
the
soft
but
we
will
leave
this
part
of
our
subject
and
proceed
towards
our
own
times
after
the
subversion
of
the
roman
power
the
northern
sovereigns
who
had
become
the
barbarous
and
ignorant
oppressors
of
our
species
introduced
and
established
among
other
political
regulations
the
feudal
system
as
it
was
called
by
which
all
property
in
land
was
held
by
certain
fiefs
whereby
the
king
or
as
termed
lord
of
the
soil
let
certain
portions
of
the
land
to
his
nobles
military
officers
and
other
great
persons
generally
often
on
condition
of
certain
services
required
to
be
performed
called
service
and
other
military
tenures
by
which
custom
those
tenants
of
the
sovereign
had
to
provide
certain
men
and
horses
to
serve
him
in
his
these
first
tenants
or
vassals
afterwards
underlet
those
lands
to
villains
so
named
in
contradistinction
to
the
present
recognised
term
from
their
living
in
villages
or
hamlets
and
other
tenants
from
whom
in
their
turn
similar
services
and
certain
provisions
were
thus
the
european
world
which
had
become
the
prey
of
effeminacy
and
luxury
had
by
this
single
important
circumstance
their
character
so
radically
changed
that
like
the
mysterious
power
of
the
cadmæan
wand
of
harlequin
wrought
so
uncommon
a
change
in
the
morals
of
european
society
that
those
who
had
formerly
kept
carriages
and
wallowed
in
all
the
soft
luxurious
delicacy
of
asiatic
effeminacy
suddenly
or
at
least
progressively
became
a
society
of
hardy
equestrian
veterans
insomuch
that
masters
and
servants
husbands
and
wives
clergy
and
laity
all
rode
upon
horses
mules
or
asses
which
latter
animals
were
chiefly
used
by
women
monks
and
other
religious
professors
the
minister
rode
to
court
the
horse
without
a
conductor
returned
to
the
stable
till
a
servant
regulated
by
the
horologe
took
him
back
to
the
court
for
his
master
in
this
manner
we
are
assured
the
magistrates
of
the
imperial
cities
rode
to
council
till
as
late
as
the
beginning
of
the
sixteenth
century
so
that
in
the
year
steps
to
assist
in
mounting
were
erected
by
the
roman
gate
at
frankfort
the
members
of
the
council
who
at
the
diet
and
other
occasions
were
employed
as
ambassadors
were
on
this
account
called
in
the
language
of
the
country
at
present
the
expression
is
preserved
in
some
of
the
imperial
cities
the
entry
of
great
lords
in
public
into
any
place
or
their
departure
from
it
was
never
in
a
carriage
but
always
on
horseback
in
all
the
pontifical
records
speaking
of
ceremonials
no
mention
is
made
either
of
a
state
coach
or
body
coachman
but
of
state
horses
and
state
mules
in
the
following
regulation
it
is
found
that
the
horse
which
his
holiness
rode
necessary
to
be
of
an
colour
not
mettlesome
but
a
quiet
tractable
nag
that
a
stool
of
three
steps
should
be
provided
for
the
assistance
of
his
holiness
in
mounting
that
the
emperor
or
kings
if
present
were
obliged
to
hold
his
stirrup
and
lead
the
bishops
made
their
public
entry
on
induction
on
horses
or
asses
richly
caparisoned
at
the
coronation
of
the
emperor
the
electors
and
principal
officers
of
the
empire
were
ordered
to
make
their
entry
on
it
was
formerly
requisite
that
those
who
received
a
fief
or
other
investiture
should
make
their
appearance
on
horseback
the
vassal
was
obliged
to
ride
with
two
attendants
to
the
court
of
his
lord
where
after
he
had
dismounted
his
horse
he
received
his
fief
covered
carriages
were
again
introduced
in
the
beginning
of
the
sixteenth
century
for
the
accommodation
of
women
of
the
very
first
rank
the
men
however
thought
it
disgraceful
to
ride
in
them
at
that
period
when
the
electors
and
other
germanic
princes
did
not
choose
to
be
present
at
the
meeting
of
the
states
they
excused
themselves
to
the
emperor
that
their
health
would
not
permit
them
to
ride
on
horseback
which
was
considered
as
an
that
it
was
unbecoming
to
them
to
ride
like
women
what
according
to
their
prevailing
ideas
was
not
permitted
to
princes
was
much
less
allowed
to
their
servants
in
when
count
wolf
of
barby
was
summoned
by
john
frederic
elector
of
saxony
to
go
to
spires
to
attend
the
convention
of
the
states
assembled
there
he
on
account
of
ill
health
to
make
use
of
a
close
carriage
with
four
horses
when
the
counts
and
nobility
were
invited
to
attend
the
solemnity
of
the
half
brother
john
ernest
the
invitation
was
accompanied
with
a
memorandum
that
such
dresses
of
ceremony
as
they
might
be
desirous
of
taking
with
them
should
be
transported
in
a
small
waggon
which
notice
would
have
been
unnecessary
had
coaches
been
generally
used
among
those
nobles
the
use
of
covered
carriages
was
in
fact
for
a
long
time
prohibited
even
to
women
the
consorts
of
princes
about
the
year
the
wife
of
a
certain
duke
obtained
from
him
with
great
difficulty
permission
to
use
a
covered
carriage
in
a
journey
to
the
baths
in
which
permission
there
was
this
express
stipulation
that
none
of
her
attendants
were
to
be
permitted
this
indulgence
though
much
pomp
was
displayed
upon
the
occasion
by
the
duchess
such
is
the
influence
of
example
in
our
superiors
who
can
mould
dependents
and
inferiors
to
whatever
shape
they
please
notwithstanding
all
these
ceremonious
regulations
about
the
end
of
the
fifteenth
century
kings
and
princes
began
to
employ
covered
carriages
in
journeys
and
afterwards
on
public
solemnities
when
richard
towards
the
close
of
the
fourteenth
century
was
compelled
to
fly
from
his
rebellious
subjects
himself
with
all
his
followers
were
on
horseback
but
his
mother
who
was
weak
and
sick
rode
in
a
carriage
but
this
became
afterwards
unfashionable
here
for
that
queen
anna
daughter
of
the
king
of
bohemia
showed
the
english
ladies
how
gracefully
she
could
ride
on
a

therefore
whirlicotes

ancient
name
for
coaches
in
england
and
chariots
were
disused
in
england

on
coronations
and
other
public
solemnities
in
the
year
after
the
battle
of
tewkesbury
which
decided
the
fate
of
henry
and
that
of
the
house
of
lancaster
when
others
flew
in
different
directions
the
queen
was
found
in
her
coach

dead
with
sorrow

came
to
frankfort
in
a
close
carriage
and
as
he
remained
in
it
on
account
of
the
wetness
of
the
weather
the
inhabitants
had
no
occasion
to
support
the
canopy
which
was
to
have
been
held
over
him
while
he
went
to
the
council

and
returned
in
the
following
year

magnificent

the
coaches
used
by
that
emperor
are
thus
described
the
imperial
coaches
no
great
magnificence
was
to
be
seen
they
were
covered
over
with
red
cloth
and
black
nails
the
harness
was
black
and
in
the
whole
work
there
was
no
gold
the
panels
were
of
glass
and
on
that
account
they
were
called
the
imperial
glass
coaches
on
festivals
the
harness
was
ornamented
with
red
silk
fringes
the
imperial
coaches
were
distinguished
only
by
their
having
leather
traces
but
the
ladies
in
the
imperial
suite
were
obliged
to
be
content
to
be
conveyed
in
carriages
the
traces
of
which
were
made
of
at
the
magnificent
court
of
ernest
augustus
at
hanover
there
were
in
fifty
gilt
coaches
with
six
horses
each
so
early
did
hanover
begin
to
surpass
other
cities
in
the
number
and
splendour
of
its
carriages
the
first
time
that
coaches
were
introduced
into
sweden
was
towards
the
end
of
the
sixteenth
century
when
john
of
finland
among
other
articles
of
luxury
brought
one
with
him
on
his
return
from
england
beckmann
also
informs
us
that
the
great
lords
of
germany
first
imagined
that
they
could
suppress
the
use
of
coaches
by
prohibitions
there
is
still
preserved
an
edict
in
which
the
feudal
nobility
and
vassals
are
forbidden
the
use
of
coaches
under
pain
of
incurring
the
punishment
of
felony
philip
duke
of
reminded
his
vassals
also
in
that
they
ought
not
to
make
so
much
use
of
carriages
as
of
horses
all
these
orders
and
admonitions
however
were
of
no
avail
and
coaches
became
common
all
over
germany
persons
of
the
first
rank
ladies
we
presume
in
france
frequently
sat
behind
their
equerry
and
the
horse
was
often
led
by
servants
when
charles
wished
to
see
the
entry
of
the
queen
he
placed
himself
behind
his
master
of
the
horse
with
whom
however
he
was
incommoded
in
the
crowd
private
persons
in
france
physicians
for
instance
used
no
carriages
in
the
fifteenth
century
in
paris
at
all
the
palaces
and
public
places
there
were
steps
for
mounting
on
horseback
carriages
notwithstanding
appear
to
have
been
used
very
early
in
france
as
appears
by
an
ordinance
issued
in
for
suppressing
luxury
and
in
which
the
citizens
were
prohibited
from
using
carriages
about
there
were
at
paris
for
the
first
time
only
three
coaches
one
of
which
belonged
to
the
queen
another
to
diana
of
poictiers
the
favourite
mistress
of
two
kings
francis
and
henry
ii
and
the
third
to
rené
de
laval
a
corpulent
nobleman
unable
to
ride
on
horseback
henry
iv
was
assassinated
in
a
coach
but
he
usually
rode
through
the
streets
of
paris
on
horseback
for
himself
and
his
queen
he
had
only
one
coach
as
appears
by
a
letter
which
he
writes
to
a
friend
which
is
still
preserved
can
not
upon
you
because
my
wife
is
using
my
roubo
in
his
costly
treatise
on
work
has
furnished
three
figures
of
carriages
used
in
the
time
of
henry
from
drawings
preserved
in
the
library
from
them
it
is
seen
those
coaches
were
not
suspended
by
straps
that
they
had
a
canopy
supported
by
ornamental
pillars
and
that
the
whole
body
was
surrounded
by
curtains
of
stuff
or
leather
which
could
be
drawn
up
the
coach
in
which
louis
iv
made
his
public
entrance
about
the
middle
of
the
seventeenth
century
appears
from
a
drawing
in
the
same
library
to
have
been
a
suspended
carriage
our
national
chronicler
john
stowe
says
coaches
were
first
known
in
england
about
he
likewise
says
they
were
first
brought
from
germany
by
the
earl
of
arundel
in
anderson
places
the
period
when
coaches
began
to
be
used
in
common
here
about
it
is
remarked
of
the
duke
of
buckingham
that
he
was
the
first
who
was
drawn
by
six
horses
in
to
ridicule
this
pomp
the
earl
of
northumberland
put
eight
horses
to
his
carriage
things
are
altered
now
when
we
have
carriages
of
every
description
for
the
high
and
low
the
rich
and
the
poor
an
open
carriage
chiefly
constructed
for
the
benefit
of
conversation
as
its
name
implies
landau
landaulets
phætons
chaises
whiskeys
cabs
fiacres
are
but
names
adapted
to
different
purposes
and
constructed
nearly
upon
the
same
principles
as
coaches
but
some
of
them
close
others
open
some
to
be
opened
or
shut
according
to
the
weather
or
taste
of
the
passengers
and
calculated
to
contain
an
indefinite
number
from
two
to
six
persons
nay
there
are
the
jolly
good
omnibuses
running
in
every
town
and
village
in
the
kingdom
the
generality
of
which
are
constructed
to
carry
twelve
inside
and
eight
outside
passengers
the
number
of
hackney
coaches
which
ply
in
the
streets
of
london
have
been
augmented
from
time
to
time
since
their
first
establishment
in
when
there
were
only
twenty
coaches
cabs
omnibuses
now
plying
amount
to
nearly
three
thousand
to
prevent
imposition
the
proprietors
of
these
carriages
are
compelled
to
have
their
names
painted
on
some
conspicuous
place
of
the
carriage
and
their
number
affixed
in
the
inside
as
well
as
the
out
this
regulation
has
become
absolutely
necessary
of
late
years
on
account
of
the
numerous
frauds
practised
by
the
coachmen
we
read
that
in
russia
there
are
employed
clumsy
but
very
convenient
sorts
of
carriages
so
constructed
as
to
be
either
closed
or
open
and
to
hold
a
bed
or
couch
called
with
which
persons
can
travel
even
for
two
or
three
thousand
miles
without
much
inconvenience
except
it
be
over
the
rough
stones
of
their
towns
owing
to
the
superior
accommodations
of
either
lying
down
or
sitting
this
change
of
position
renders
a
journey
less
irksome
without
which
it
would
prove
intolerable
in
russia
from
riga
to
the
crimea
at
least
post
horses
are
furnished
by
the
government
and
entrusted
to
subalterns
in
the
russian
army
to
provide
them
coaches
for
hire
were
first
established
by
public
authority
in
france
as
early
as
there
are
employed
in
the
streets
of
the
capital
no
fewer
than
three
thousand
hackney
coaches
as
early
as
the
year
charles
villerme
paid
into
the
royal
treasury
fifteen
thousand
livres
for
the
exclusive
privilege
of
keeping
and
using
fiacres
in
paris
post
chaises
were
introduced
in
the
year
hackney
coaches
were
established
in
edinburgh
in
when
the
number
was
only
twenty
public
fiacres
were
introduced
at
warsaw
in
in
amsterdam
the
coaches
have
no
wheels
nor
have
they
any
at
petersburg
in
the
winter
they
are
used
as
sledges
the
of
the
city
of
london
is
a
species
of
or
the
hereditary
property
of
the
city
it
is
a
very
large
and
apparently
extremely
heavy
machine
but
superbly
decorated
with
large
panels
of
crystal
glass
richly
gilt
and
elegantly
painted
with
several
appropriate
designs
in
one
of
the
centre
panels
among
a
group
of
figures
is
one
supporting
a
shield
bearing
the
inscription
in
the
old
english
character
therefore
we
conjecture
that
the
coach
was
constructed
at
a
period
coeval
with
the
above
date
saddles
bridles
and
stirrups
in
the
earliest
ages
it
was
customary
to
ride
without
either
bridles
or
saddles
if
the
poet
be
worthy
of
credit
for
we
observe
lucan
speaking
of
the
massillians
says
a
saddle
the
massilians
ride
and
with
a
bending
switch
their
horses
they
regulated
the
motion
of
the
horses
by
a
switch
and
their
voice
it
has
been
observed
that
the
case
was
the
same
with
the
numidians
getulians
libyans
as
well
as
most
of
the
grecian
people
as
the
reason
of
the
thing
appears
to
point
out
the
superior
expediency
of
a
bridle
they
afterwards
came
into
fashion
among
the
greeks
which
they
called
because
it
is
said
the
bit
of
the
bridle
bore
a
resemblance
to
the
teeth
of
the
wolf
whence
lucan
says
of
it
with
the
sharper
bits
manage
unruly
in
the
east
it
would
appear
that
bridles
at
least
were
used
at
an
early
period
for
we
have
a
great
number
of
texts
in
the
scripture
which
definitely
express
as
much
in
the
psalms
and
likewise
in
proverbs
the
name
and
application
of
the
bridle
is
often
particularly
mentioned
and
more
frequently
alluded
to
virgil
indeed
says
referring
to
very
early
times
lapithæ
of
pelethronium
rode
with
bridles
first
and
what
their
use
was
the
saddle
is
also
of
ancient
origin
for
we
read
in
kings
he
said
unto
his
sons
me
the
ass
so
they
saddled
him
the
ass
and
he
rode
and
before
that
period
in
the
second
generation
after
noah
the
assyrian
empire
was
established
in
its
commencement
even
as
early
as
the
days
of
semiramis
the
wife
of
ninus
the
first
assyrian
king
who
built
ninevah
there
were
those
articles
of
horse
furniture
called
and
for
in
ancient
historians
we
find
the
following
passage
occur
in
this
respect
ascended
from
the
plain
to
the
top
of
the
mountain
by
laying
the
packs
and
fardels
of
the
beasts
that
followed
her
one
upon
the
same
author
informs
us
that
this
was
mount
bagistan
in
medea
and
that
it
was
seventeen
furlongs
from
the
top
to
the
bottom
in
the
first
ages
among
the
greeks
and
romans
a
cloth
or
mattrass
a
piece
of
leather
or
raw
hide
was
all
they
used
for
a
saddle
such
coverings
afterwards
became
more
costly
silius
italicus
says
they
were
made
of
costly
skins
it
however
appears
that
after
they
were
become
common
it
was
considered
as
effeminate
to
use
them
hence
the
romans
despised
them
and
in
his
old
age
varro
boasts
of
having
when
young
rode
without
a
covering
to
his
horse
xenophon
reproaches
the
persians
because
they
put
more
clothes
upon
the
backs
of
their
horses
than
upon
their
beds
from
the
aspect
in
which
hardy
people
viewed
this
practice
the
warlike
teutones
considered
it
most
disgraceful
and
despised
the
roman
cavalry
in
the
fifth
century
saddles
were
so
magnificent
that
a
prohibition
was
issued
by
leo
that
they
should
not
be
ornamented
with
pearls
or
precious
stones
in
the
sixth
century
the
emperor
mauritas
directed
that
they
should
have
coverings
of
fur
of
large
dimensions
from
every
information
we
have
been
able
to
collect
we
believe
that
the
appendage
of
stirrups
were
not
added
to
saddles
before
the
sixth
century
it
is
said
that
previous
to
the
introduction
of
stirrups
the
young
and
agile
used
to
mount
their
horses
by
vaulting
upon
them
which
many
did
in
an
expert
and
graceful
manner
of
course
practice
was
essential
to
this
perfection
that
this
should
be
afforded
wooden
horses
were
placed
in
the
campus
martius
where
this
exercise
was
performed
of
mounting
or
dismounting
on
either
side
first
without
and
next
with
arms
cavalry
had
also
occasionally
a
strap
of
leather
or
a
metallic
projection
affixed
to
their
spears
in
or
upon
which
the
foot
being
placed
the
ascent
became
more
practicable
respecting
the
period
of
this
invention
montfaucon
has
presumed
that
the
invention
must
have
been
subsequent
to
the
use
of
saddles
however
opposed
to
this
opinion
an
ingenious
argument
has
been
offered
that
is
possible
they
might
have
been
anterior
to
that
invention
because
it
is
said
they
might
have
been
appended
to
a
girth
round
the
body
of
the
horse
both
hippocrates
and
galen
speak
of
a
disease
to
which
the
feet
and
ancles
were
subject
from
long
riding
occasioned
by
suspension
of
the
feet
without
a
suetonius
the
roman
informs
us
that
germanicus
the
father
of
caligula
was
wont
to
ride
after
dinner
to
strengthen
his
ancles
by
the
action
of
riding
affording
the
blood
freer
circulation
in
the
part
the
latin
names
assigned
them
have
been
various
among
which
is
in
which
sense
mauritius
in
his
treatise
on
the
art
of
war
is
said
to
have
named
them
now
this
writer
is
supposed
to
have
lived
in
the
sixth
century
but
we
conceive
it
is
pretty
evident
they
had
an
earlier
existence
in
arabia
turkey
and
persia
as
there
is
an
alto
as
well
as
of
this
last
country
still
extant
which
is
believed
to
have
been
as
ancient
as
the
days
of
darius
because
it
was
brought
from
the
city
he
built
persepolis
having
this
representation
the
invention
and
name
of
stirrup
is
supposed
to
have
been
borrowed
from
the
anatomy
of
the
ear
where
a
band
is
found
resembling
it
in
form
when
we
consider
the
vast
importance
of
security
to
the
feet
of
that
useful
animal
the
horse
we
can
not
but
feel
surprised
that
on
account
of
the
very
rough
roads
the
ancients
must
occasionally
had
to
travel
that
some
metallic
shoes
had
not
been
invented
and
introduced
previously
to
the
period
when
they
appeared
that
the
security
of
the
rider
necessarily
depended
upon
the
safety
of
the
animal
he
rode
can
not
be
questioned
hence
then
we
do
not
wonder
to
observe
that
the
sagacious
aristotle
and
pliny
should
remark
upon
the
covering
placed
upon
the
feet
of
those
animals
of
draught
and
burden
from
what
these
authors
have
said
however
we
dare
not
conclude
that
the
feet
of
horses
or
camels
were
faced
or
shod
with
iron
but
it
should
rather
seem
that
in
time
of
war
or
on
long
journeys
the
feet
of
both
kinds
of
beasts
were
prepared
with
such
species
of
shoes
as
the
common
people
wore
and
which
were
generally
made
of
strong
we
are
told
that
when
the
hoofs
of
cattle
particularly
oxen
had
sustained
any
injury
or
hurt
they
were
furnished
with
shoes
made
of
spanish
or
african
broom
with
which
linen
is
often
manufactured
in
the
south
of
france
and
italy
also
shoes
of
some
of
the
plants
of
the
hemp
kind
which
were
woven
or
plaited
together
although
these
may
be
considered
as
only
a
species
of
surgical
bandages
with
regard
to
oxen
but
such
shoes
were
particularly
given
to
mules
which
in
days
of
old
were
employed
much
more
than
at
present
for
riding
and
from
some
instances
of
immoderate
extravagance
in
people
of
rank
it
appears
that
they
had
for
their
animals
very
costly
shoes
of
some
of
the
most
valuable
metals
nero
when
he
undertook
short
journeys
was
drawn
always
by
mules
shod
with
silver
and
those
of
his
wife
were
shod
with
gold
the
circumstance
being
barely
mentioned
without
any
particular
detail
we
are
anxious
to
afford
any
certain
information
on
the
mode
in
which
those
shoes
were
constructed
from
a
passage
in
dio
cassius
we
have
reason
to
believe
that
it
was
only
the
upper
part
of
the
shoe
that
was
made
of
those
costly
metals
or
that
they
were
plaited
from
thin
slips
xenophon
relates
that
a
certain
people
in
asia
were
in
the
habit
of
drawing
socks
over
the
feet
of
their
horses
when
the
snow
lay
deep
on
the
ground
the
kamschatkian
employs
the
same
means
to
preserve
the
feet
of
his
dogs
which
draw
his
sledge
or
hunt
the
seals
upon
the
ice
those
species
of
shoes
according
to
captain
cook
are
so
ingeniously
made
as
to
be
bound
and
at
the
same
time
to
admit
the
claws
of
the
animal
through
them
from
a
passage
found
in
suetonius
we
may
infer
that
the
roman
were
put
on
in
the
manner
we
have
mentioned
for
that
author
says
that
the
coachman
of
vespasian
once
stopped
to
put
on
the
shoes
of
his
mules
this
being
the
case
the
probability
appears
pretty
certain
that
in
deep
roads
and
moist
soils
the
animals
must
have
frequently
lost
their
shoes
artemedorus
speaks
of
a
shod
horse
and
uses
the
same
kind
of
expression
whilst
speaking
of
other
cattle
winkelman
has
described
a
cut
stone
in
the
collection
of
baron
stosch
on
which
is
represented
the
figure
of
a
man
holding
one
foot
of
a
horse
whilst
another
kneeling
is
employed
in
fastening
a
shoe
that
it
was
not
usual
to
shoe
the
may
be
gathered
from
this
when
mithridates
was
besieging
cyzicus
he
was
obliged
to
send
his
cavalry
to
bythnia
because
the
hoofs
of
the
horses
were
entirely
spoiled
and
worn
out
diodorus
siculus
informs
us
that
alexander
in
his
expedition
proceeded
with
uninterrupted
marches
until
the
feet
of
his
horses
were
entirely
broken
and
destroyed
a
like
instance
occurs
in
cinnamus
where
the
cavalry
were
obliged
to
be
left
behind
because
the
horses
had
suffered
considerably
in
their
hoofs
to
which
he
adds
they
were
often
liable
hence
it
may
perhaps
appear
that
such
as
are
now
in
use
were
unknown
to
the
ancients
and
chardiu
gives
no
representation
of
them
in
ancient
persian
antiquities
in
the
grave
of
childeric
a
northern
chieftain
and
king
of
france
was
discovered
a
piece
of
iron
which
the
learned
antiquarians
who
saw
it
pronounced
from
that
portion
of
it
which
the
rust
had
left
to
have
been
an
old
they
saw
or
thought
they
saw
four
distinct
apertures
for
nails
on
each
side
but
whilst
they
were
endeavouring
to
remove
the
corrosive
excrescence
of
rust
to
ascertain
with
more
certainty
it
broke
under
their
hands
the
reason
why
we
mentioned
this
here
is
that
if
the
relic
discovered
was
really
a
it
must
have
been
one
of
the
most
ancient
specimens
known
because
we
find
that
monarch
died
in
the
year
his
grave
was
discovered
at
tournay
in
the
occasion
of
his
having
a
in
his
grave
was
from
the
creed
of
his
religion
the
superstitious
belief
of
the
scandinavians
taught
them
to
place
implicit
confidence
in
the
power
of
this
amulet
to
prevent
the
ingress
of
evil
spirits
the
remains
of
this
belief
is
even
now
often
seen
in
the
obscure
streets
of
the
british
metropolis
and
indeed
throughout
the
country
where
the
mystic
shoe
frequently
appears
as
the
faithful
guardian
of
the
domestic
threshold
it
is
we
understand
the
opinion
of
the
french
historian
daniel
that
in
the
ninth
century
horses
were
not
shod
always
but
only
in
the
time
of
frost
and
on
some
other
very
particular
occasions
the
practice
of
shoeing
horses
was
introduced
into
england
by
william
i
we
are
told
that
this
monarch
gave
the
city
of
northampton
as
a
fief
to
a
certain
person
one
of
his
attendants
in
consideration
of
his
paying
a
certain
sum
yearly
for
the
shoeing
of
horses
and
it
is
also
alleged
that
henry
or
hugh
de
ferres
or
de
ferrers
was
the
same
person
who
held
this
fief
on
the
above
condition
and
who
was
the
ancestor
of
the
family
of
that
name
and
who
still
bear
six
in
their
coat
of
arms
this
was
the
person
whom
william
entrusted
to
inspect
his
farriers
we
should
not
omit
to
observe
that
it
is
remarked
that
have
been
found
with
other
riding
furniture
in
the
graves
of
some
of
the
old
inhabitants
of
germany
and
also
in
those
of
the
vandals
in
the
north
of
europe
gunpowder
the
express
period
when
was
first
discovered
is
extremely
uncertain
but
that
this
nitrum
is
an
alkaline
salt
there
is
little
difficulty
in
proving
it
has
indeed
been
conjectured
that
it
was
a
component
part
of
the
invented
about
the
year
which
has
been
generally
believed
to
be
the
origin
of
gunpowder
from
the
oldest
prescriptions
which
have
been
found
and
which
is
said
to
be
that
given
by
the
princess
anna
commena
in
which
however
only
resin
sulphur
and
oil
are
mentioned
saltpetre
does
not
appear
it
is
believed
by
an
author
very
well
qualified
to
form
a
judgment
on
the
question
that
the
first
certain
account
we
have
of
saltpetre
by
that
express
name
occurs
in
the
oldest
account
of
the
invention
of
gunpowder
which
according
to
him
professor
beckmann
occurred
in
the
thirteenth
century
rees
in
his
cyclopedia
expressly
says
about
the
year
and
that
it
was
first
used
by
the
venetians
employed
against
the
genoese
in
also
that
it
was
first
in
europe
at
a
place
now
known
as
chrogia
against
laurence
de
medicis
and
the
last
named
authority
adds
all
italy
made
complaint
against
it
as
a
contravention
of
the
law
of
rees
gives
the
following
recipe
for
its
manufacture
without
distinguishing
the
proportionate
parts
composition
of
nitre
sulphur
and
charcoal
mixed
together
and
usually
he
describes
its
effects
by
observing
that
easily
takes
fire
and
when
fired
rarifies
and
expands
with
great
vehemence
by
means
of
its
elastic
force
also
that
may
be
made
without
by
means
of
we
have
two
accounts
preserved
to
us
of
the
original
of
this
invention
the
first
of
which
was
given
by
our
illustrious
countryman
roger
bacon
called
the
wonderful
doctor
who
died
previous
to
which
period
gunpowder
must
have
existed
the
other
account
is
by
albertus
magnus
in
a
work
published
in
it
is
said
to
be
doubted
whether
albertus
was
the
author
of
the
book
which
bears
his
name
but
that
he
whoever
he
may
have
been
and
bacon
are
presumed
to
have
taken
their
information
from
the
same
identical
source
about
the
period
of
the
invention
of
gunpowder
it
appears
the
art
of
making
the
greek
fire
began
to
be
lost
in
the
works
of
roger
bacon
the
term
occurs
three
times
according
to
casiri
the
term
is
to
be
found
in
an
arabic
the
author
of
which
existed
about
if
the
work
of
geber
investigatione
be
genuine
and
if
this
writer
lived
as
has
been
thought
in
the
eighth
century
it
would
be
the
oldest
where
saltpetre
is
mentioned
in
a
prescription
for
an
which
appears
to
be
almost
we
are
inclined
to
believe
however
from
various
authorities
that
gunpowder
was
invented
in
india
as
it
was
proved
in
a
paper
read
before
the
french
national
institute
by
langles
that
the
arabians
obtained
a
knowledge
of
gunpowder
from
the
indians
who
had
been
acquainted
with
it
from
the
earliest
periods
the
use
of
it
in
war
is
said
to
have
been
prohibited
them
in
their
sacred
books
it
was
employed
in
at
a
battle
near
mecca
by
the
arabians
it
was
brought
by
the
saracens
from
africa
to
the
europeans
who
improved
the
preparation
and
first
discovered
various
ways
of
employing
it
in
war
in
no
country
could
saltpetre
and
its
various
uses
be
more
easily
discovered
than
in
india
where
the
soil
is
so
rich
in
nitrous
particles
that
nothing
is
necessary
but
lixiviation
to
obtain
saltpetre
and
where
this
substance
is
so
abundant
that
almost
all
the
gunpowder
used
in
different
wars
with
which
european
sovereigns
have
tormented
themselves
burdened
their
subjects
with
intolerable
taxes
and
cursed
the
world
from
its
invention
has
been
made
from
indian
saltpetre
had
not
saltpetre
been
known
previous
to
the
thirteenth
century
neither
could
gunpowder
or
aquafortis
have
existed
and
for
the
best
of
all
reasons
that
neither
of
them
could
be
made
without
saltpetre
or
nitre
but
should
it
appear
that
this
neutral
salt
was
known
in
india
long
prior
to
that
period
and
used
by
indians
as
well
as
arabians
before
they
were
employed
by
europeans
and
considering
the
former
to
have
practised
chemistry
previous
to
the
latter
should
this
have
been
proved
perhaps
a
similar
proof
will
necessarily
await
upon
the
articles
aquafortis
and
gunpowder
because
if
this
affirmation
be
established
it
will
be
discovered
that
europeans
knew
nothing
of
aquafortis
until
after
the
arabian
chemists
probability
appears
to
favour
the
idea
that
at
or
about
the
twelfth
century
the
accumulated
number
of
consequents
from
the
improvement
in
european
science
the
arts
we
now
possess
were
introduced
into
our
catalogue
nitre
aquafortis
and
gunpowder
after
the
period
that
saltpetre
became
necessary
to
governments
for
the
manufacture
of
gunpowder
they
endeavoured
to
obtain
it
at
a
cheap
rate
and
for
that
purpose
were
guilty
in
some
countries
of
the
most
violent
and
oppressive
measures
intruding
upon
private
property
of
every
description
to
furnish
it
hunting
for
the
effervescence
even
in
old
walls
to
the
great
annoyance
of
individuals
but
after
repeated
acts
of
the
most
flagrant
oppression
from
the
public
officers
and
from
farmers
to
whom
this
iniquitous
practice
was
entrusted
they
could
not
procure
a
sufficiency
but
were
obliged
to
have
recourse
to
traffic
in
india
for
that
purpose
guns
that
these
dangerous
weapons
were
not
known
in
europe
previous
to
the
introduction
of
gunpowder
may
be
safely
inferred
as
without
that
substance
their
necessity
or
utility
is
wanting
at
first
the
construction
of
this
machine
was
characterised
by
that
awkward
rude
and
cumbersome
appearance
which
generally
distinguished
all
inventions
in
their
infancy
reminding
us
of
those
very
rude
instruments
brought
from
the
sandwich
islands
and
deposited
in
our
museum
the
first
portable
were
discharged
by
a
match
in
course
of
time
this
was
fastened
to
a
cock
for
the
greater
security
of
the
hand
whilst
discharging
the
piece
afterwards
a
was
attached
screwed
into
a
cock
with
a
steel
plate
before
it
and
fixed
in
a
small
wheel
which
could
be
wound
up
by
a
key
affixed
to
the
barrel
this
was
not
at
first
of
a
vitreous
nature
like
that
now
in
use
for
striking
fire
but
a
compact
pyrites
long
known
as
such
and
called
a
as
an
instrument
so
furnished
was
often
liable
to
miss
fire
till
a
late
period
a
match
was
still
continued
with
the
wheel
and
it
was
not
till
a
considerable
time
after
that
instead
of
a
friable
pyrites
so
much
exposed
to
effloresce
a
vitreous
stone
was
affixed
to
the
improvement
of
the
lock
somewhat
resembling
our
own
but
these
progressive
improvements
advanced
slowly
because
as
recently
as
the
early
part
of
the
last
century
these
clumsy
contrivances
were
in
use
during
that
period
those
instruments
were
denominated
by
various
names
chiefly
german
and
dutch
such
as
musket
martinet
pistol
the
first
of
these
names
arose
from
the
oldest
portable
kind
of
having
a
similarity
to
a
box
there
were
long
and
short
the
latter
of
which
were
peculiar
to
cavalry
the
longest
kind
also
from
their
resemblance
to
a
pipe
were
called
in
germany
large
pieces
which
were
conveyed
on
carriages
were
called
from
the
action
of
conveyance
soon
afterwards
cannon
were
introduced
at
first
called
now
known
as
artillery
however
and
others
concerned
in
those
employments
still
use
the
terms
previously
mentioned
the
hackenbuchse
were
so
very
large
and
unwieldy
that
if
carried
in
the
hand
they
could
not
be
used
manually
alone
they
were
therefore
supported
by
a
post
or
stay
called
a
because
it
had
a
forked
end
somewhat
resembling
the
horns
of
the
buck
between
which
the
piece
was
fixed
by
a
hook
projecting
from
the
stock
there
is
still
preserved
in
the
tower
of
london
an
old
a
specimen
of
every
species
of
our
national
arms
may
be
seen
in
the
same
place
from
those
terms
it
would
appear
that
not
only
the
english
but
also
the
french
and
most
other
european
nations
took
the
names
of
their
it
appears
that
pistols
were
first
used
in
germany
they
had
a
wheel
attached
to
them
bellay
mentions
them
in
the
year
in
the
time
of
francis
and
under
henry
the
german
horsemen
were
called
several
historians
think
that
the
name
came
from
pistolia
in
tuscany
because
there
they
were
first
made
and
if
we
might
hazard
an
opinion
we
think
this
conjecture
right
hence
although
germany
might
first
have
generally
used
them
we
think
they
were
an
italian
invention
muskets
are
said
to
have
received
their
name
from
either
the
french
or
else
from
the
latin
however
we
are
of
opinion
that
neither
of
these
terms
gave
its
original
and
submit
that
it
is
derived
from
the
latin
the
fall
of
men
being
as
sudden
after
the
explosion
of
this
deadly
weapon
as
the
death
of
a
fly
after
it
is
flapped
by
that
instrument
which
was
common
in
the
shambles
of
ancient
rome
daniel
proves
they
were
known
in
france
as
early
as
the
period
of
francis
brandome
however
asserts
they
were
introduced
by
the
duke
of
alva
that
cruel
monster
in
human
shape
that
tool
of
a
tyrant
whose
name
has
its
full
merit
when
it
has
eternal
execration
as
the
exploits
of
that
diabolical
character
in
the
spanish
netherlands
bear
indubitable
testimony
that
wretch
existed
in
and
they
were
not
known
in
france
at
that
period
as
brandome
endeavours
to
prove
or
we
should
have
had
more
intelligence
handed
down
to
posterity
by
the
commentators
of
one
who
would
so
willingly
have
used
such
an
instrument
the
is
said
to
have
been
invented
in
the
city
of
nuremberg
in
germany
about
but
that
can
not
be
considered
as
the
lock
of
the
present
day
as
even
in
germany
the
is
known
by
the
name
of
the
which
certainly
militates
against
the
previous
assertion
the
one
giving
the
name
perhaps
to
the
other
beckmann
says
the
history
of
the
brunswick
military
it
is
stated
that
the
soldiers
of
that
duchy
first
obtained
instead
of
in
it
has
often
been
asserted
he
continues
which
took
fire
of
themselves
were
forbidden
first
in
bohemia
and
moravia
and
afterwards
in
the
whole
german
empire
under
a
severe
penalty
by
the
emperor
maximilian
but
i
have
not
found
any
allusion
to
this
circumstance
in
the
different
police
laws
of
that
that
the
first
were
pyrites
appears
from
various
sources
and
afterwards
a
vitreous
kind
of
stone
was
introduced
in
its
stead
this
circumstance
is
said
to
have
produced
some
kind
of
confusion
as
in
many
instances
the
properties
were
applied
to
that
stone
which
were
related
by
the
germans
of
antiquity
as
belonging
to
pyrites
in
germany
this
vitreous
stone
was
called
in
sweden
and
denmark
and
in
england
this
appellation
is
of
great
antiquity
anciently
in
germany
as
it
appears
from
the
song
of
hildebrand
a
metrical
romance
of
very
early
date
that
hildebrand
and
hudebrand
a
father
and
son
and
at
the
moment
ignorant
of
their
affinity
agreed
to
fight
for
each
armour
and
it
is
said
let
fly
their
ashen
spears
with
such
force
that
they
stuck
in
the
shields
and
they
thrust
resounding
axes
of
flint
against
each
other
having
uplifted
their
shields
previously
but
the
lady
ulta
rushed
in
between
them
know
the
cross
of
gold
said
she
i
gave
him
for
his
shield
this
is
my
hildebrand
you
hudebrand
sheath
your
sword
this
is
your
father
then
she
led
both
champions
into
the
hall
and
gave
them
meat
and
wine
with
many
besides
these
proofs
that
the
ancient
name
of
the
stone
was
known
in
germany
by
the
appellation
which
species
of
stone
may
perhaps
without
hazarding
the
danger
of
error
be
conceived
to
be
the
same
which
zipporah
the
wife
of
moses
is
represented
to
have
used
in
the
verse
of
the
chapter
of
exodus
zipporah
took
a
sharp
stone
and
cut
off
the
foreskin
of
her
son
and
cast
it
at
his
feet
and
said
surely
a
bloody
husband
thou
art
to
and
it
is
added
she
said
so
on
account
of
the
circumcision
in
addition
to
what
has
appeared
let
us
add
it
can
not
be
doubted
that
the
instrument
fired
by
this
stone
first
obtained
for
it
in
germany
the
name
of
as
the
ancient
name
may
in
general
be
now
lost
it
is
commonly
called
those
people
acquainted
with
the
northern
scandinavian
and
german
antiquities
know
that
the
knives
employed
in
ancient
sacrifices
and
other
sharp
instruments
were
made
of
this
stone
as
appears
from
the
remains
being
yet
discovered
in
old
barrows
and
between
urns
it
is
also
presumed
that
the
ethiopian
stone
mentioned
as
used
by
one
of
the
egyptian
embalmers
first
to
open
the
body
to
get
at
the
intestines
was
a
the
soil
being
in
some
places
siliceous
or
chalky
naturally
produces
such
stones
in
common
with
that
earth
the
flint
is
a
stone
indigenous
in
most
european
countries
they
are
commonly
collected
and
manufactured
by
people
whose
occupation
allows
them
much
spare
time
the
easiest
mode
to
shape
them
is
with
a
species
of
pillow
of
or
some
other
soft
material
sown
up
in
coarse
cloth
held
upon
the
knees
and
with
a
hammer
having
a
bevil
edge
they
may
be
broken
into
almost
any
form
or
size
by
those
accustomed
to
the
practice
the
great
quantity
of
the
material
from
whence
they
are
composed
allows
for
any
waste
which
accident
may
produce
in
several
counties
of
england
they
are
so
plentiful
that
they
are
the
common
material
employed
for
mending
the
public
roads
but
we
are
informed
that
this
is
not
the
case
in
france
where
in
time
of
war
the
people
were
prohibited
from
exporting
them
the
dutch
are
commonly
large
dealers
in
this
article
flint
is
a
large
component
in
the
manufacture
of
glass
gun
flints
are
now
however
comparatively
little
used
as
percussion
caps
are
generally
substituted
which
act
with
more
certainty
and
require
a
great
deal
less
trouble
astronomy
not
being
greedy
of
delusion
ourselves
neither
would
we
lead
others
into
error
but
on
the
contrary
are
desirous
to
avoid
all
deception
as
we
may
be
considered
over
studious
to
give
the
most
rational
origin
and
where
we
can
not
get
at
the
history
of
those
objects
which
engage
our
attention
whenever
this
is
uncertain
we
resort
to
nature
experience
and
reason
and
furnish
the
most
correct
explanation
our
contracted
circle
of
information
will
permit
whenever
we
discover
the
clue
of
history
we
collect
the
most
satisfactory
detail
our
limits
will
afford
us
to
insert

by
the
preceding
notions
and
directed
by
those
principles
we
have
endeavoured
correctly
to
conceive
and
faithfully
to
portray
our
own
conceptions
in
the
best
manner
our
experience
might
enable
us
to
make
a
just
distinction
between
metaphorical
allusion
and
literal
application
ever
endeavouring
to
discriminate
between
serious
assertion
and
studied
fable
we
fully
coincide
with
the
just
remark
of
the
learned
author
of
antiquities
who
says
in
respect
to
the
early
ages
of
the
world
all
the
remains
of
genuine
history
except
that
contained
in
the
sacred
annals
is
only
to
be
obtained
through
the
mazes
of
it
must
be
confessed
that
to
sift
this
grain
of
corn
from
the
bushel
of
chaff
with
which
it
is
surrounded
where
every
effort
which
the
ingenuity
of
greece
could
devise
to
render
fable
as
current
as
truth
was
resorted
to
is
no
small
task
that
it
requires
the
operation
of
the
best
exercised
reason
and
the
assistance
of
extraordinary
judgment
which
is
only
to
be
attained
through
the
medium
of
extensive
experience
and
the
exercise
of
clear
and
discriminative
powers
then
we
pretend
not
to
possess
the
best
of
possible
acquisitions
of
this
kind
but
the
best
in
our
power
we
have
endeavoured
to
collect
and
summoned
to
our
assistance
and
the
value
of
our
labours
we
will
leave
the
public
to
judge
if
the
application
of
observations
like
the
preceding
ever
come
surely
they
apply
to
the
present
article
since
from
the
science
all
the
errors
of
an
idolatrous
race
proceeded
in
the
major
part
of
the
population
of
the
ancient
world
from
thence
also
proceeded
the
most
sublime
imagery
which
embellishes
the
syren
voice
of
poetic
song
the
grandest
metaphors
and
the
sweetest
allegories
which
ornament
the
transendent
eloquence
of
the
most
able
rhetoricians
of
greece
and
rome
the
fire
of
exquisitely
natural
and
most
noble
allusions
which
enliven
and
embellish
their
historic
pages
the
sweetest
philosophical
explications
also
flowed
from
thence
which
ornament
the
various
immortal
works
of
their
most
excellent
poets
orators
historians
natural
and
moral
philosophers
and
in
brief
of
every
description
of
the
sublimest
genius
of
ancient
greece
and
rome
in
their
most
divine
effusions
it
will
appear
we
believe
that
the
first
astronomers
of
chaldea
phœnicia
and
egypt
are
not
now
known
as
astronomers
by
name
if
we
except
the
person
of
the
royal
nimrod
the
founder
of
the
chaldean
empire
which
name
is
often
confounded
with
belus
sometimes
one
is
put
for
the
other
and
often
belus
is
called
the
son
of
nimrod
how
the
truth
of
this
was
we
shall
not
at
present
determine
be
it
as
it
may
it
is
allowed
on
all
hands
that
the
sideral
science
claims
for
its
inventor
no
less
a
person
than
the
founder
of
the
first
monarchy
in
the
world
that
this
science
was
first
introduced
by
the
founder
of
the
tower
of
babel
is
not
questioned
because
it
is
more
evident
that
in
that
country
there
must
have
existed
from
necessity
the
expediency
of
the
most
approved
observation
which
could
be
made
upon
this
eminently
useful
science
where
on
account
of
the
excessive
solar
heat
people
generally
travel
by
night
where
for
hundreds
of
miles
are
nothing
but
pathless
deserts
with
a
horizon
as
boundless
and
little
impeded
as
that
of
the
ocean
assuredly
under
such
circumstances
the
local
situation
of
the
site
of
the
immense
observatory
of
babel
must
point
out
the
expediency
of
procuring
some
intelligence
from
the
position
which
the
inhabitants
discovered
the
host
of
heaven
to
appear
in
at
the
rising
setting
for
from
what
will
appear
in
the
course
of
this
article
it
will
be
very
evident
that
the
tower
of
babel
was
constructed
for
the
purpose
of
an
astronomical
observatory
farther
that
the
climate
of
chaldea
was
most
favourable
to
the
exercise
of
that
sublime
art
will
not
admit
of
a
question
when
we
consider
the
atmosphere
is
so
pure
so
clear
so
free
from
exhalation
that
at
night
the
sky
is
said
to
resemble
an
immense
canopy
of
black
velvet
studded
with
embossed
gold
from
the
appearance
of
the
stars
and
that
it
was
not
only
the
appearance
of
the
stars
their
rising
setting
and
motion
by
which
they
knew
time
was
to
be
measured
but
also
the
distinction
between
one
star
and
another
could
be
correctly
ascertained
from
the
usual
colour
here
it
was
the
various
planets
zodiacal
constellations
and
the
other
asterisms
in
both
hemispheres
received
their
primary
names
the
preceding
circumstance
it
is
conceived
fixes
the
local
place
where
the
science
had
its
origin
the
tower
of
babel
was
a
parallelogram
with
sides
of
unequal
length

is
nothing
that
can
with
certainty
be
related
concerning
it
yet
it
is
apparent
it
was
of
an
exceeding
great
height
and

the
advantage
of
it

exactly
observed

upon
which
stood
two
cups
weighing
thirty
talents
and
near
to
them
as
many
censers
weighing
three
hundred
talents
there
were
likewise
placed
three
drinking
bowls
of
gold
the
one

jupiter
weighed
two
hundred
talents
and
the
others
six
hundred
we
have
been
thus
circumstantial
in
our
description
of
babylon
for
obvious
reasons
first
that
it
was
the
first
local
situation
where
since
the
deluge
men
had
associated
for
civil
purposes
and
secondly
because
it
was
the
original
station
where
the
astronomical
science
was
cultivated
from
chaldea
astronomy
travelled
to
egypt
where
she
was
studied
for
many
ages
she
also
went
to
phœnicia
where
she
was
regarded
with
equal
attention
but
the
peculiar
occasion
which
the
phœnician
people
had
to
improve
their
acquaintance
with
this
science
will
appear
upon
reflecting
that
these
people
occupied
a
narrow
and
barren
tract
of
land
between
the
mediterranean
and
arabian
seas
therefore
they
found
it
essentially
necessary
to
improve
their
situation
by
those
means
which
divine
providence
had
apparently
marked
out
for
them
to
resort
unto
we
accordingly
find
them
applying
to
mercantile
industry
as
a
commercial
people
in
this
character
they
were
the
ready
medium
of
communication
between
every
part
of
the
then
known
world
in
consequence
they
had
factories
or
mercantile
stations
up
the
mediterranean
but
particularly
on
its
european
side
on
the
shores
of
the
atlantic
and
even
in
the
british
sea
we
recognise
their
occupying
marseilles
and
others
on
the
coast
of
france
cadiz
on
that
of
spain
the
lizard
point
and
other
places
in
cornwall
where
they
traded
for
tin
in
the
british
isles
in
brief
their
commercial
spirit
carried
them
to
every
part
of
the
globe
by
the
by
admitting
that
rational
belief
be
allowed
to
plato
and
solon
we
shall
find
that
they
had
in
the
first
ages
explored
the
atlantic
ocean
and
even
discovered
america
a
great
variety
of
authorities
may
be
adduced
to
prove
the
assertion
that
the
phœnicians
made
three
descents
on
the
american
coast
and
others
who
say
that
the
inhabitants
discovered
there
by
the
spaniards
gave
the
same
names
to
the
plants
as
had
been
assigned
them
in
asia
that
their
religious
rites
were
similar
and
general
customs
and
manners
the
same
we
refer
to
joseph
da
of
the
indies
published
in
this
author
was
an
and
wrote
from
actual
observation
the
phœnicians
in
the
exercise
of
their
mercantile
functions
had
the
most
obvious
necessity
to
cultivate
the
sideral
science
we
find
that
they
accordingly
did
so
and
made
various
improvements
and
very
important
discoveries
by
their
exercise
from
the
northern
hemisphere
being
more
known
to
them
than
it
was
to
the
chaldeans
they
discovered
that
splendid
and
beautiful
asterism
or
the
an
asterism
of
the
most
singular
service
before
the
properties
of
the
magnet
were
discovered
and
which
star
was
sometimes
called
from
them
phœnice
from
phœnicia
and
egypt
the
celestial
science
of
astronomy
was
brought
into
greece
with
which
people
the
phœnicians
were
intimate
for
they
by
trade
having
occasion
to
converse
with
the
greeks
and
also
from
uniting
in
one
national
resemblance
the
three
opposite
characteristics
of
soldiers
sailors
and
men
of
science
the
communications
between
the
two
people
were
very
frequent
at
every
period
from
the
first
establishment
of
the
grecian
states
that
highly
eminent
and
intellectual
people
collected
from
all
others
every
particular
they
could
obtain
in
all
matters
having
relation
to
sciences
and
arts
those
they
cultivated
with
a
success
worthy
of
the
motive
which
first
induced
them
to
make

they
succeeded
beyond
all
others

obtaining

favours
the
first

appears
on
record
to
have
cultivated
the
celestial
science
with
success
was
thales
born
at
miletus
in
asia
minor
six
hundred
and
forty
one
years
before
christ
he
explained
the
causes
of
eclipses
and
predicted
one
he
also
taught
that
the
earth
was
round
and
divided
into
five
zones
he
discovered
the
solstices
and
equinoxes
and
likewise
divided
the
year
into
three
hundred
and
days
he
had
travelled
into
egypt
in
search
of
knowledge
where
he
ascertained
the
height
of
one
of
the
pyramids
from
its
shade
he
looked
upon
water
as
the
principle
of
all
things
from
him
the
sect
called
the
ionic
had
their
origin
anaximander
his
pupil
followed
him
and
supported
the
opinions
of
his
great
master
he
was
born
before
christ
six
hundred
and
ten
years
he
invented
maps
and
dials
and
is
said
to
have
constructed
a
sphere
his
ideas
of
the
planets
were
however
erroneous
anaximenes
was
a
scholar
of
anaximander
and
born
five
hundred
and
years
before
christ
he
taught
that
air
was
the
origin
of
all
things
and
many
erroneous
notions
among
others
that
the
earth
was
a
plane
and
the
heavens
a
solid

affixed
to
it

anaxagoras
of
clazomene
the
pupil
of
and
successor
to
anaximenes
born
before
christ
five
hundred
and
sixty
years
the
doctrines
he
supported
are
a
strange
association
of
important
truths
mixed
with
the
most
gross
absurdities
he
taught
that
the
world
was
made
by
a
being
of
infinite
power
that
mind
was
the
origin
of
motion
that
the
upper
regions
which
he
called
ether
were
filled
with
fire
that
the
rapid
revolution
of
this
ether
had
raised
large
masses
of
stone
from
the
earth
which
being
inflamed
formed
the
stars
which
were
kept
in
their
places
and
prevented
from
falling
by
the
velocity
of
their
motion
his
ideas
of
the
solar
orb
were
extremely
erroneous
alleging
according
to
different
authors
various
uncertain
positions
respecting
the
materials
of
which
that
planet
is
composed
one
says
said
it
was
a
vast
mass
of
fire
another
states
opinion
that
it
was
iron
and
a
third
that
it
was
of
stone
he
taught
that
the
comets
are
an
assemblage
of
planets
that
winds
are
produced
in
consequence
of
highly
rarified
air
that
thunder
and
lightning
are
a
collision
of
clouds
earthquakes
by
subterraneous
air
forcing
its
passage
upwards
that
the
moon
is
inhabited
this
philosopher
removed
his
school
from
miletus
to
athens
which
was
thenceforth
the
grand
seat
of
all
learning
he
had
taught
there
for
thirty
years
when
he
was
prosecuted
for
his
philosophical
opinions
particularly
for
his
just
ideas
relative
to
the
deity
and
condemned
to
death
when
sentence
was
pronounced
he
said
is
long
since
nature
condemned
me
to
however
according
to
the
laws
of
athens
he
was
permitted
an
appeal
to
the
people
in
which
his
scholar
the
immortal
pericles
saved
his
life
by
his
eloquence
his
sentence
of
death
was
changed
into
banishment
whilst
in
prison
he
determined
exactly
the
proportion
of
the
circumference
of
the
circle
to
its
diameter
denominated
the
he
died
at
lampsacus
archelaus
his
scholar
was
the
preceptor
of
the
divine
socrates
pythagoras
was
another
scholar
of
thales
the
place
of
his
nativity
is
uncertain
but
having
settled
in
the
island
of
samos
he
is
generally
reckoned
of
that
place
he
travelled
in
search
of
knowledge
through
phœnicia
chaldea
egypt
and
india
however
meeting
with
little
encouragement
on
his
return
to
samos
he
passed
over
to
italy
in
the
time
of
tarquin
the
proud
and
opened
a
school
at
croto
a
city
in
the
gulf
of
tarentum
where
he
had
a
number
of
students
and
gained
much
reputation
his
pupils
were
obliged
to
listen
in
silence
for
at
least
two
years
if
talkative
longer
sometimes
for
five
years
before
they
were
permitted
to
ask
him
any
questions
for
which
time
they
were
because
they
were
set
to
study
geometry
dialling
music
and
other
high
sciences
called
by
the
greeks
but
the
name
of
was
commonly
applied
to
those
who
cultivated
the
stellary
science
and
who
predicted
the
fortunes
of
men
by
observing
the
stars
under
which
they
were
born
this
luminary
of
science
first
assumed
the
appellation
of
before
him
those
whose
pursuits
have
now
that
title
were
called
sages
or
wise
men
he
was
the
founder
of
the
sect
called
the
italic
he
was
so
much
honoured
whilst
living
and
his
memory
honoured
when
dead
by
the
romans
that
they
attributed
to
him
the
learning
of
numa
who
lived
much
earlier
about
the
year
of
the
city
the
delphian
oracle
having
directed
the
romans
to
erect
statues
to
the
bravest
and
wisest
of
the
greeks
they
conferred
that
honour
upon
alcibiades
and
pythagoras
he
taught
publicly
that
the
earth
is
the
centre
of
the
universe
but
to
his
scholars
he
gave
his
real
opinions
similar
to
those
afterwards
adopted
by
copernicus
that
the
earth
and
all
the
planets
moved
round
the
sun
as
their
and
which
doctrine
he
is
presumed
to
have
derived
from
either
the
chaldeans
or
indians
he
thought
that
the
earth
is
round
and
everywhere
inhabited
hence
he
admitted
that
we
might
have
antipodes
which
name
is
said
to
have
been
invented
by
plato
pythagoras
was
distinguished
for
his
skill
in
music
which
he
first
reduced
to
certain
firm
principles
and
likewise
for
his
discoveries
in
geometry
he
first
proved
that
in
a
triangle
the
square
of
the
hypothenuse
or
side
subtending
the
right
angle
is
equal
to
the
two
other
sides
also
that
of
all
plain
figures
having
equal
circumference
the
circle
is
largest
and
of
all
solids
having
equal
surfaces
the
sphere
is
the
largest
pythagoras
likewise
taught
that
all
things
were
made
of
fire
that
the
deity
animated
the
universe
as
the
soul
does
the
body
which
doctrine
with
that
of
the
metempsychosis
or
transmigration
he
likewise
taught
and
which
thoughts
were
adopted
by
plato
and
are
most
beautifully
expressed
by
virgil
that
the
sun
the
moon
the
planets
and
fixed
stars
are
all
actuated
by
some
divinity
and
move
each
in
a
transparent
solid
sphere
in
the
order
following
next
to
the
earth
the
moon
then
mercury
venus
the
sun
mars
jupiter
saturn
the
sphere
of
the
fixed
stars
last
of
all
that
those
move
with
a
sound
inconceivably
beautiful
which
ears
can
not
comprehend
those
eight
spheres
he
imagined
to
be
analogous
to
the
eight
notes
in
music
empedocles
the
chief
scholar
of
pythagoras
entertained
the
same
sentiments
with
his
teacher
concerning
astronomy
he
is
said
to
have
thrown
himself
into
the
crater
of
mount
etna
to
make
himself
pass
for
a
god
or
perhaps
which
may
approach
nearer
the
truth
because
he
could
not
discover
the
cause
of
the
eruption
or
else
in
his
endeavours
to
discover
the
cause
one
of
his
iron
sandals
being
thrown
up
by
the
volcano
revealed
the
mode
in
which
he
had
perished
philolaus
also
a
scholar
of
pythagoras
first
taught
publicly
the
diurnal
motion
of
the
earth
upon
its
axis
and
its
annual
motion
round
the
sun
which
first
suggested
to
copernicus
the
idea
of
that
system
which
he
established
meteon
born
at
leuconæ
a
village
near
athens
first
introduced
into
europe
the
lunar
cycle
consisting
of
nineteen
solar
years
or
nineteen
lunar
years
and
seven
intercalary
months
it
had
been
first
adopted
by
the
chaldeans
meteon
published
it
at
the
olympic
games
where
it
was
received
with
so
great
applause
that
it
was
then
universally
adopted
through
the
grecian
states
and
their
colonies
and
got
the
name
of
the
cycle
or
golden
number
to
denote
its
excellence
which
name
it
still
retains
it
was
also
called
the
great
year
which
name
was
likewise
applied
to
various
spaces
of
time
by
different
authors
by
virgil
to
the
solar
year
to
distinguish
it
from
the
monthly
revolution
of
the
moon
by
cicero
and
others
to
the
revolution
of
six
hundred
years
or
three
thousand

called
also
several

of

to
it

greek
calendars

determined

celebration
of
their
annual
feasts
were
adjusted
meteon
is
said
to
have
derived
his
knowledge
of
this
subject
from
chaldea
the
opinions
of
the
subsequently
registered
astronomer
xonophanes
founder
of
the
eleatic
school
are
so
truly
monstrous
that
after
the
light
which
had
appeared
he
must
have
travelled
with
his
eyes
shut
or
else
the
rage
for
novelty

the
scientific
of
greece
as
it
did
their
choosing
to
travel
a
long
way
for
new
thoughts
when
they
might
have
found
much
better
at
hand
xonophanes
among
other
whimsical
opinions
maintained
that
the
stars
were
extinguished
every
morning
and
illuminated
every
evening
that
the
sun
is
an
inflamed
cloud
that
eclipses
happen
by
the
extinction
of
the
sun
which
is
afterwards
lighted
up
that
the
moon
is
ten
times
larger
than
the
earth
that
there
are
many
suns
and
moons
to
illumine
different
climates
the
eleatic
school
was
chiefly
famous
for
the
study
of
logic
or
the
art
of
ratiocination
first
invented
by
zeno
those
of
this
sect
paid
but
little
attention
to
science
or
the
study
of
nature
philosophy
was
anciently
divided
into
three
parts
natural
moral
and
the
art
of
reasoning
xonophanes
was
succeeded
by
parmenides
his
scholar
who
in
addition
to
his
absurdities
taught
that
the
earth
was
habitable
in
only
the
two
temperate
zones
that
the
earth
was
suspended
in
the
middle
of
the
universe
in
a
fluid
lighter
than
air
that
all
bodies
left
to
themselves
light
on
its
surface
this
bore
a
slight
resemblance
to
the
newtonian
doctrine
of
attraction
democritus
of
abdera
a
scholar
of
leucippus
who
flourished
four
hundred
and
years
before
christ
was
the
first
publisher
of
the
atomic
cosmogony
invented
by
mochus
the
phœnician
said
to
have
been
received
by
his
master
leucippus
both
admitted
plurality
of
worlds
democritus
was
the
first
who
taught
that
the
milky
way
is
occasioned
by
the
confused
light
of
an
infinite
number
of
stars
which
doctrine
is
still
maintained
by
the
best
informed
of
philosophers
he
also
extended
that
idea
to
comets
the
number
of
which
seneca
says
the
greek
philosophers
did
not
know
and
that
democritus
suspected
there
were
more
planets
than
we
could
see
this
was
also
the
opinion
of
many
others
the
truth
of
which
has
been
verified
in
the
discoveries
of
pallas
juno
vesta
and
the
democritus
is
considered
as
the
parent
of
experimental
philosophy
the
greatest
part
of
his
time
was
devoted
to
it
and
he
is
said
to
have
made
many
discoveries
he
like
meteon
and
newton
maintained
the
absurd
idea
of
the
existence
of
a
vacuum
which
was
denied
by
thales
and
descartes
democritus
also
maintained
that
the
sea
was
constantly
diminishing
he
declared
that
he
would
prefer
the
discovery
of
one
of
the
causes
of
the
works
of
nature
to
the
possession
of
the
persian
monarchy
often
laughing
at
the
follies
of
mankind
he
was
thought
by
the
vulgar
to
be
out
of
his
mind
but
hippocrates
being
sent
to
cure
him
soon
found
him
to
be
the
wisest
man
of
the
age
and
seneca
reckons
him
the
most
acute
and
ingenious
of
the
ancients
on
account
of
his
many
useful
inventions
particularly
his
ingenious
making
of
artificial
emeralds
tinging
them
of
any
colour
of
softening
ivory
dissolving
stones
although
the
chief
attention
of
plato
and
aristotle
was
directed
to
other
grand
objects
yet
they
much
contributed
to
the
improvement
of
astronomy
notwithstanding
the
most
famous
in
this
respect
was
eudoxus
the
scholar
of
plato
who
was
famous
for
his
skill
in
astrology
natural
and
judicial
or
the
art
of
foretelling
future
events
by
the
relative
situations
of
the
stars
of
their
various
influences
an
art
which
prevailed
for
many
ages
among
the
ancients
and
is
yet
assiduously
cultivated
by
the
modern
arabians
and
other
orientals
although
in
a
great
measure
exploded
in
european
nations

the
former

which
divisions
in
this

are
foretold

and

atmosphere
whilst
the
latter
foretold
the
characters
fortunes
of
men
from
the
stellary
disposition
at
the
moment
of
their
respective
nativities
the
philosopher
eudoxus
spent
much
of
his
time
on
the
top
of
a
high
mountain
to
observe
the
motion
of
the
stars
he
regulated
the
greek
year
as
cæsar
did
the
roman
had
the
ancient
grecian
astronomers
been
equally
attached
to
experiment
with
democritus
they
might
have
arrived
at
more
certain
conclusions
but
they
were
content
with
speculative
theory
and
spoke
rather
from
conjecture
than
observation
whence
both
strabio
and
polybius
treated
as
fabulous
the
since
recognised
assertion
of
pythius
a
famous
navigator
to
the
north
who
had
sailed
to
a
country
supposed
to
be
iceland
where
he
said
the
sun
in
the
middle
of
summer
never
set
the
most
important
improvements
in
astronomy
were
made
in
the
school
of
alexandria
founded
by
ptolemy
philadelphus
and
which
seminary
flourished
for
nine
hundred
and
years
till
the
invasion
of
the
saracen
army
under
the
command
of
amrou
those
astronomers
were
chiefly
greeks
or
of
grecian
extraction
the
most
learned
men
being
invited
here
by
the
liberality
of
the
ptolemies
the
first
who
distinguished
themselves
were
timocarus
and
aristillus
prior
to
the
foundation
of
the
library
which
was
founded
three
hundred
years
before
christ
those
two
men
endeavoured
to
determine
the
places
of
the
different
stars
and
thus
to
trace
the
course
of
the
planets
the
next
and
most
eminent
man
was
aristarchus
about
two
hundred
and
years
before
christ
who
taught
that
the
sun
was
about
nineteen
times
further
from
the
earth
than
the
moon
which
is
not
the
twentieth
part
of
its
real
distance
although
the
philosophers
of
the
pythagorean
school
did
not
consider
it
above
three
times
and
perhaps
only
one
and
a
half
further
distant
aristarchus
also
taught
that
the
moon
was
diameters
of
our
earth
from
this
globe
which
opinion
comes
near
to
the
truth
he
believed
it
to
be
scarcely
of
its
real
size
he
was
widely
erroneous
in
his
conception
of
the
dimensions
he
also
in
conformity
to
the
doctrines
of
pythagorus
and
philolaus
supposed
the
sun
to
be
placed
in
the
centre
and
that
the
earth
moved
round
it
on
which
account
he
was
accused
of
impiety
as
disturbing
the
repose
of
the
vesta
and
the
lares
this
opinion
was
not
however
retained
by
his
successors
in
the
alexandrian
school
contrary
to
the
doctrine
of
the
greek
philosophers
he
taught
that
the
stars
were
at
different
distances
and
that
the
orbit
of
the
earth
round
the
sun
was
an
insensible
point
in
consequence
of
the
immense
distance
of
the
stars
the
only
work
of
aristarchus
which
remains
is
on
the
magnitude
and
distance
of
the
sun
and
moon
very
nearly
contemporary
with
aristarchus
was
euclid
the
celebrated
geometrician
of
alexandria
manetho
an
astrologer
and
historian
and
aratus
and
cleanthus
disciples
of
zeno
the
stoic
philosopher
all
of
whom
contributed
to
the
enlargement
of
astronomical
knowledge
but
particularly
the
two
first
named
eratosthenes
born
at
cyrene
succeeded
aristarchus
being
invited
by
ptolemy
euergetes
this
professor
is
said
to
be
the
inventor
of
the
armillary
sphere
an
instrument
or
machine
composed
of
moveable
sides
representing
the
equator
the
two
colures
with
the
meridian
all
of
which
turned
round
on
an
axis
directed
to
the
two
poles
of
the
world
each
of
which
circles
were
anciently
called
armilla
and
the
whole
machine
astrolabus
all
instruments
which
could
be
contrived
for
the
promotion
of
this
science
were
furnished
at
the
public
expense
and
placed
within
the
observatory
of
alexandria
assisted
by
these
instruments
eratosthenes
first
undertook
to
measure
the
obliquity
of
the
ecliptics
or
rather
the
double
of
that
obliquity
that
is
the
distance
from
the
tropics
which
he
made
to
be
about
degrees
the
obliquity
or
half
of
this
distance
degrees
this
grand
attempt
was
to
ascertain
the
exact
distance
of
a
degree
of
the
meridian
and
thus
to
determine
the
circumference
of
the
earth
which
he
accomplished
with
wonderful
exactness
considering
the
period
at
which
he
lived
and
he
performed
this
by
the
same
method
since
adopted
by
the
moderns
who
have
succeeded
him
he
is
also
said
to
have
discovered
the
true
distance
of
the
sun
from
the
earth
the
great
archimedes
lived
contemporary
with
eratosthenes
that
eminent
geometrician
of
syracuse
whose
inventive
genius
in
mechanics
had
constructed
engines
which
protracted
the
fall
of
that
capital
with
its
island
sicily
to
the
almost
omnipotent
power
of
rome
for
a
considerable
period
the
most
illustrious
astronomer
which
had
as
yet
appeared
at
alexandria
was
hipparchus
who
flourished
between
one
hundred
and
sixty
and
one
hundred
and
years
before
christ
he
first
brought
this
science
into
a
tangible
elementary
form
rendering
it
systematic
he
discovered
or
was
the
first
who
observed
the
difference
between
the
autumnal
and
the
vernal
equinox
the
former
being
seven
days
longer
than
the
latter
which
proceeds
from
the
eccentricity
of
the
orbit
first
discovered
from
observing
the
inequality
of
the
solar
motion
he
framed
tables
for
what
is
called
equation
of
time
or
to
ascertain
the
difference
between
the
shade
on
a
well
constructed
dial
and
a
perfectly
regulated
clock
he
made
great
progress
in
explaining
the
motions
and
phases
of
the
moon
however
he
was
not
so
successful
with
respect
to
the
planets
his
greatest
work
was
his
ascertaining
the
number
of
the
stars
marking
their
distances
and
arriving
at
the
means
by
which
their
precise
places
on
the
hemisphere
of
alexandria
could
be
known
he
marked
one
thousand
six
hundred
stars
in
signs
into
which
the
heavens
were
divided
pliny
says
this
was
a
labour
which
must
have
been
difficult
even
to
a
god
the
appearance
of
a
new
star
induced
him
to
set
about
and
accomplish
this
work
which
he
did
in
a
catalogue
for
the
benefit
of
future
observers
hipparchus
does
not
mention
comets
whence
it
has
been
conjectured
he
had
never
seen
any
it
has
also
been
suggested
that
he
considered
them
with
meteors
which
are
not
objects
of
astronomical
observation
he
divided
the
heavens
into
constellations
twelve
in
the
ecliptic
in
the
north
and
sixteen
in
the
south
to
one
of
these
he
gave
the
name
of
hair
in
honour
of
the
wife
of
ptolemy
soter
who
had
consecrated
her
hair
which
was
very
beautiful
to
venus
urania
if
her
husband
should
return
from
a
war
in
asia
victorious
it
being
hung
up
in
the
temple
of
the
goddess
soon
after
disappeared
and
is
said
to
have
been
carried
off
by
the
gods
hipparchus
likewise
constructed
a
sphere
or
celestial
globe
on
which
all
the
stars
visible
at
alexandria
were
depicted
and
thought
to
have
been
similar
to
the
faranese
globe
at
rome
still
extant
in
his
observations
on
the
stars
he
discovered
that
when
viewed
from
the
same
spot
their
distance
always
appeared
the
same
from
each
other
but
he
discovered
the
distance
of
the
moon
to
be
different
in
various
parts
of
the
heavens
for
instance
in
the
horizon
and
zenith
this
he
conceived
to
be
owing
to
the
extent
of
the
globe
he
therefore
contrived
a
method
of
reducing
appearances
of
this
kind
to
what
they
would
be
if
viewed
from
the
centre
of
the
earth
which
is
called
a
parallax
and
the
discovery
of
it
was
of
the
greatest
importance
to
astronomy
he
took
this
idea
from
observing
that
a
tree
in
the
middle
of
a
plain
appeared
in
different
parts
of
the
horizon
when
viewed
from
different
situations
so
does
a
star
appear
in
the
various
points
of
the
heavens
when
viewed
in
different
parts
of
the
globe
hipparchus
was
the
first
who
connected
geography
with
astronomy
and
this
fixed
both
the
sciences
on
certain
principles
after
the
overthrow
of
the
roman
empire
the
first
encourager
of
learning
was
charles
the
great
or
charlemagne
but
little
could
be
done
in
his
time
after
his
death
the
former
ignorance

and
proposed
a
plan
for
the
correction
of
it
to
pope

is
presumed
from
his
writings
to
have
known
the
use

influence
on

and
the
transmutation
of

on
account
of
his
vast
knowledge
in

he
was
called

for
the
same
reason
he
was
suspected
of

pretext
whilst
at

fled
into

and
again
introduced
the

which
was
greatly
promoted
by
the
munificence
of
the
emperor
frederick
pope
nicholas
and
particularly
of

justly
merited
the

in
who
was

was
succeeded
by
a
scholar
more
skilful

with
great
reputation
at

who
is
said
to
have
first
made

fracastorius
born
at
verona
in
was
a
celebrated
astronomer
and
an
eminent
poet
and
good
philosopher
he
made
considerable
discoveries
in
this
science
and
with
all
his
abilities
may
be
considered
as
the
precursor
of
the
celebrated
copernicus
nicholas
copernicus
the
restorer
of
the
pythagorean
philosophy
and
the
modern
discoverer
of
the
rational
and
true
system
of
astronomy
as
now
universally
received
under
the
title
of
his
name
was
born
at
thorn
a
city
of
royal
prussia
february
having
learnt
the
latin
and
greek
languages
in
his
house
he
was
sent
to
cracow
to
be
instructed
in
philosophy
and
physic
where
he
was
honoured
with
the
degree
of
doctor
showing
a
greater
predilection
for
mathematics
than
medicine
his
uncle
by
his
side
was
a
bishop
who
gave
him
a
canonry
upon
his
return
from
italy
whither
he
had
gone
to
study
astronomy
under
dominic
maria
at
bologna
and
had
afterwards
taught
mathematics
with
success
at
rome
in
the
repose
and
solitude
of
an
ecclesiastical
life
he
bent
his
chief
attention
to
the
study
of
astronomy
dissatisfied
with
the
system
of
ptolemy
which
had
prevailed
fourteen
centuries
he
laboured
to
form
a
juster
one
what
led
him
to
discover
the
mistakes
of
ptolemy
was
his
observations
on
the
motions
of
venus
he
is
said
to
have
derived
his
first
notion
on
this
subject
from
various
passages
in
the
classics
which
mention
the
opinions
of
pythagoras
and
his
followers
as
indeed
he
himself
acknowledges
in
his
address
to
pope
paul
iii
he
established
the
rotation
of
the
earth
round
its
axis
and
its
motion
round
the
sun
but
to
explain
certain
irregularities
in
the
motion
of
the
planets
he
retained
the
epicicles
and
eccentrics
of
ptolemy
his
work
was
first
printed
at
nuremberg
in
a
short
time
before
his
death
the
doctrines
of
copernicus
were
not
at
first
generally
adopted
the
most
eminent
professors
in
europe
adhered
to
the
old
opinions
among
the
astronomers
of
this
period
the
landgrave
of
hesse
deserves
particular
praise
who
erected
a
magnificent
observatory
at
the
top
of
the
castle
of
cassel
and
made
many
observations
himself
in
conjunction
with
christopher
rothman
and
justus
burge
concerning
the
place
of
the
sun
of
the
planets
and
of
the
stars
but
the
person
who
enriched
astronomy
with
the
greatest
number
of
facts
of
any
modern
who
had
yet
appeared
was
tycho
brahe
a
dane
of
noble
extraction
born
in
designed
by
his
parents
for
the
study
of
the
law
but
attracted
by
an
eclipse
of
the
sun
in
at
copenhagen
whither
he
had
been
sent
to
learn
philosophy
he
was
struck
with
astonishment
in
observing
that
the
phenomenon
happened
at
the
very
moment
it
had
been
predicted
he
admired
the
art
of
predicting
eclipses
and
wished
to
acquire
it
at
first
for
want
of
proper
instruments
he
fell
into
several
mistakes
which
however
he
afterwards
corrected
having
early
perceived
his
future
improvements
must
depend
on
instruments
he
caused
some
to
be
constructed
larger
than
usual
and
thus
rendered
more
exact
on
the
november
he
perceived
a
new
star
in
cassiopeia
which
continued
without
changing
its
place
till
spring
equal
in
splendour
to
jupiter
or
venus
it
last
it
changed
colours
and
entirely
disappeared
nothing
similar
to
this
had
been
observed
since
the
days
of
hipparchus
tycho
in
imitation
of
that
illustrious
astronomer
conceived
a
design
of
forming
a
catalogue
of
the
stars
to
promote
his
views
the
king
of
denmark
ordered
a
castle
to
be
built
in
hueun
an
island
between
seonia
and
zealand
which
tycho
called
uranibourg
city
of
heaven
and
where
he
placed
the
finest
collection
of
instruments
that
had
ever
yet
appeared
most
of
them
invented
or
else
improved
by
himself
he
composed
a
catalogue
of
seven
hundred
and
stars
with
greater
exactness
than
had
ever
been
done
before
and
constructed
tables
for
finding
the
place
of
the
most
remarkable
stars
at
any
given
time
he
was
the
first
who
determined
the
effect
of
refraction
whereby
we
see
the
sun
or
any
star
above
the
horizon
before
it
is
so
in
reality
as
we
see
the
bottom
of
a
vessel
when
filled
with
water
standing
at
a
distance
which
we
could
not
see
when
empty
he
made
several
other
improvements
and
important
discoveries
which
he
published
in
a
work
entitled
the
labours
of
tycho
attracted
the
attention
of
europe
the
learned
went
to
consult
him
and
the
noble
to
see
him
james
vi
of
scotland
when
he
went
to
espouse
the
sister
of
frederic
king
of
denmark
paid
tycho
a
visit
with
all
his
retinue
and
wrote
some
latin
verses
in
his
praise
but
these
honours
were
of
short
continuance
after
the
death
of
his
protector
king
frederic
the
pension
assigned
him
was
withdrawn
and
he
was
compelled
to
exile
himself
from
his
native
country
having
hired
a
ship
he
transported
his
furniture
books
and
instruments
to
a
small
place
in
hamburgh
in
the
emperor
rodolphus
invited
him
into
his
dominions
settled
a
large
pension
upon
him
gave
him
a
castle
near
prague
to
prosecute
his
discoveries
and
appointed
him
longomatus
a
native
of
jutland
and
the
celebrated
kepler
to
assist
him
but
tycho
was
not
happy
in
his
new
situation
he
died
october
repeating
several
times
have
not
lived
in
kepler
was
one
of
the
greatest
philosophers
that
ever
lived
and
ought
to
be
considered
as
the
discoverer
of
the
system
of
the
world
he
was
born
in
germany
at
wiel
near
wirtemberg
december
he
early
imbibed
the
principles
of
copernicus
after
the
death
of
tycho
he
was
employed
to
finish
the
tables
which
he
had
begun
to
compose
from
his
observations
kepler
took
twenty
years
to
finish
them
he
dedicated
them
to
the
emperor
under
the
title
of
the
kepler
united
optics
with
astronomy
and
thus
made
the
most
important
discoveries
he
was
the
first
who
discovered
that
the
move
not
in
a
circle
but
in
an
and
that
altogether
they
move
sometimes
faster
and
sometimes
slower
yet
that
they
describe
equal
areas
in
equal
times
that
is
that
the
spaces
through
which
they
move
in
different
parts
of
their
orbit
are
of
equal
times
though
of
unequal
length
yet
when
two
straight
lines
are
drawn
from
the
extremity
of
either
space
to
the
centre
of
the
sun
they
form
triangles
which
include
equal
areas
he
likewise
demonstrated
that
the
squares
of
the
periodical
times
of
the
revolution
of
the
planets
round
the
sun
are
in
proportion
to
the
cubes
of
their
distance
from
him
a
theorem
of
the
greatest
use
in
astronomical
calculations
for
having
the
periodical
times
of
two
planets
given
and
if
the
distance
of
one
of
them
be
known
by
the
rule
of
proportion
the
distance
of
the
other
can
be
ascertained
kepler
is
said
to
have
used
logarithms
in
framing
his
this
great
man
died
in
poverty
november
at
ratisbon
whither
he
had
gone
to
solicit
the
arrears
of
his
pension
which
had
been
very
ill
paid
he
left
nothing
to
his
wife
and
children
but
the
remembrance
of
his
virtues
contemporary
with
kepler
was
galileo
born
at
pisa
in
italy
in
illustrious
for
his
improvements
in
mechanics
for
his
application
of
the
effects
of
gravity
and
for
the
invention
or
at
least
the
improvement
of
telescopes
the
use
of
spectacles
or
reading
glasses
convex
for
and
concave
for
persons
had
been
invented
by
one
spina
a
monk
at
pisa
in
or
as
some
say
by
our
countryman
roger
bacon
the
use
of
telescopes
or
glasses
for
viewing
objects
at
a
distance
was
invented
by
zachary
janssen
a
at
middleburg
or
rather
as
it
is
said
from
the
accidental
discovery
of
a
child
the
honour
of
this
invention
is
also
claimed
by
others
it
is
certain
that
galileo
first
improved
them
so
as
to
answer
astronomical
purposes
he
also
first
made
use
of
the
single
pendulum
for
measuring
time
in
making
his
observations
to
which
he
was
led
by
considering
one
day
the
vibrations
of
a
lamp
suspended
from
the
vaulted
roof
of
a
church
he
likewise
discovered
the
gravity
of
the
atmosphere
from
the
rising
of
water
in
a
pump
by
the
action
of
a
piston
which
led
the
way
to
the
invention
of
the
barometer
by
his
scholar
toricelli
the
use
of
telescopes
opened
in
a
manner
a
new
world
to
galileo
he
observed
with
astonishment
the
increased
magnitude
and
splendour
of
the
planets
and
their
satellites
formerly
invisible
which
afforded
additional
proofs
of
the
veracity
of
the
copernican
system
particularly
the
satellites
of
jupiter
and
the
phasis
of
venus
he
discovered
an
innumerable
multitude
of
fixed
stars
which
the
naked
eye
could
not
discern
and
what
greatly
excited
his
wonder
without
the
least
increase
in
their
size
or
brightness
about
the
same
time
john
napier
of
merchiston
in
scotland
invented
what
are
called
first
published
at
edinburgh
in
afterwards
improved
by
briggs
professor
of
geometry
at
oxford
in
which
by
a
very
ingenious
contrivance
addition
is
made
to
answer
for
multiplication
and
subtraction
for
division
an
invention
of
the
greatest
utility
in
astronomical
calculations
galileo
was
not
afflicted
with
poverty
but
with
persecution
at
seventy
years
of
age
he
was
called
before
the
holy
inquisition
for
supporting
opinions
contrary
to
scripture
and
was
obliged
on
the
of
june
formally
to
abjure
them
to
avoid
being
burnt
as
a
heretic
the
system
of
copernicus
had
yet
gained
but
few
converts
and
the
bulk
of
professions
and
learned
men
in
europe
attached
to
the
philosophy
of
aristotle
supported
the
old
doctrine
galileo
was
condemned
to
prison
and
confined
to
the
small
city
of
arcem
with
its
territory
where
he
consoled
himself
by
the
study
of
astronomy
he
contrived
a
method
of
discovering
the
longitude
by
the
satellites
of
jupiter
which
however
has
not
been
productive
of
all
the
advantages
he
expected
he
died
in
prison
or
rather
in
exile
in
although
there
were
a
great
number
of
astronomers
contemporary
with
kepler
and
galileo
none
made
any
conspicuous
figure
john
bayer
of
augsburg
introduced
the
jewish
method
of
marking
the
stars
with
letters
of
the
greek
and
latin
alphabets
this
the
jews
use
because
their
law
does
not
permit
the
use
of
figures
the
produce
of
fancy
in
astronomers
were
very
attentive
to
observe
the
transit
of
venus
over
the
disc
of
the
sun
which
kepler
had
predicted
as
a
confirmation
of
the
system
of
copernicus
mercury
was
observed
by
gassendi
in
france
and
some
others
but
the
transit
of
venus
did
not
then
take
place
for
their
inspection
the
transit
of
venus
was
first
seen
by
jeremiah
horrox
of
hoole
an
obscure
village
fifteen
miles
north
of
liverpool
on
the
of
november
and
at
the
same
time
by
his
friend
william
crabtree
at
manchester
horrox
was
born
in
and
died
in
in
the
year
of
his
age
he
wrote
an
account
of
his
observations
which
were
published
after
his
death
under
the
title
of
in
sole
visa
by
hevelius
the
copernican
system
was
first
publicly
defended
in
england
by
wilkins
in
in
france
by
gassendi
the
son
of
a
peasant
in
provence
who
published
many
valuable
works
on
philosophy
he
was
born
in
and
died
in

was
violently
opposed

from
a
noble
family
the
son
of
a
counsellor
of
brittany
in
france
born
at
haye
in
tourraine
of
march
early
distinguished
himself
by
his
knowledge
in
algebra
and
geometry
he
attacked
and
overturned
the
philosophy
of
aristotle
in
his
own
country
he
attempted
to
establish
certain
principles
which
though
founded
in
theory
he
took
for
granted
by
which
he
accounted
for
all
appearances
like
mochus
and
democritus
he
imagined
all
space
to
be
filled
with
corpuscules
or
atoms
in
continual
agitation
and
denied
the
possibility
of
a
vacuum
he
explained
everything
by
supposing
vortices
or
motions
round
a
centre
according
to
the
opinions
of
democritus
and
thus
discovered
the
centrifugal
force
in
the
circular
motion
of
the
planets
but
the
system
of
descartes
not
being
founded
on
facts
or
experiments
did
not
subsist
long
although
at
first
it
had
many
followers
his
astronomical
opinions
were
much
the
same
with
those
of
copernicus
although
the
lively
notions
of
descartes
led
him
into
error
yet
his
exalted
views
greatly
contributed
to
the
improvement
of
science
men
were
led
to
observation
and
experiments
in
order
to
overturn
his
system
and
astronomy
was
cultivated
by
persons
of
ability
bouillard
at
paris

at
oxford
and
by
helvelius
at
dantzic
who
constructed
a
fine
observatory
and
collected
a
great
many
facts
by
his
long
assiduous
observation
for
fifty
years
during
which
he
made
many
discoveries
concerning
the
planets
fixed
stars
and
particularly
comets
colbert
in
the
name
of

sent
him
a
sum
of

hevelius
published
a
catalogue
of
fixed
stars
entitled
sobieskianum
dedicated
to
john
sobieski
king
of

at
that
time
justly
famous
for
having

the
commentator

famous
for
the
application
of
pendulums
to
clocks
and
springs
to
watches
for
the
improvement
of
telescopes
and
microscopes
and
for
the
great
discoveries
he
made
in
consequence
of
these
improvements
in
astronomy
the
establishment
of
academies
or
societies
at
this
time
contributed
greatly
to
the
advancement
of
science
the
royal
society
in
london
was
begun
in
but
did
not
assume
a
regular
form
till
its
transactions
were
first
published
in
the
academy
of
sciences
at
paris
was
founded
in
by
louis
who
invited
to
it
rœmer
from
denmark
huygens
and
cassini
from
italy
cassini
was
born
at
perinaldo
in
the
county
of
nice
on
the
of
june
and
was
appointed
first
professor
in
the
royal
observatory
at
paris
where
he
prosecuted
his
discoveries
till
his
death
in
and
was
succeeded
by
his
son
he
was
assisted
by
picard
auzoul
and
la
hire
by
the
direction
of
the
academy
of
sciences
at
paris
a
voyage
was
undertaken
by
riecher
and
meurisse
at
the
expense
to
the
island
of
caienne
in
south
america
almost
under
the
equator
in
to
ascertain
several
philosophical
facts
the
refraction
of
light
the
parallax
of
mars
and
of
the
sun
the
distance
of
the
tropics
the
variation
in
the
motion
of
the
pendulum
the
parallax
of
the
sun
is
the
angle
under
which
an
observer
at
the
sun
would
see
the
earth
this
cassini
fixed
at
seconds
and
the
angle
under
which
we
see
the
sun
at
minutes
and
seconds
or
seconds
hence
he
concluded
that
these
are
as
to
or
as
to
so
that
according
to
cassini
the
of
the
earth
is
one
hundred
times
less
than
that
of
the
sun
and
consequently
the
sun
is
a
million
times
larger
than
the
earth
the
parallax
of
the
sun
has
since
from
the
transit
of
venus
of
june
and
of
june
been
discovered
to
be
but
about
seconds
consequently
his
comparative
bulk
to
that
of
the
earth
and
his
distance
from
it
to
be
proportionably
greater
the
method
of
finding
the
distance
of
the
earth
from
the
sun
and
consequently
of
the
other
planets
was
first
proposed
by
halley
who
had
never
seen
and
was
morally
certain
he
would
never
see
this
appearance
meurisse
died
during
the
voyage
riecher
returned
in
his
answer
to
the
parallax
of
mars
was
not
satisfactory
cassini
calculated
it
at
seconds
the
distance
of
the
tropics
was
found
to
be
degrees
minutes
seconds
the
chief
advantage
resulting
from
the
voyage
was
ascertaining
the
vibration
of
the
pendulum
in
placard
remarked
that
clocks
went
slower
in
summer
than
in
winter
owing
to
as
since
ascertained
that
it
is
the
property
of
heat
to
dilate
bodies
which
consequently
lengthens
the
pendulum
that
cold
produces
an
opposite
effect
riecher
found
that
the
pendulum
made
vibrations
less
at
caienne
than
at
paris
that
it
went
two
minutes
and
twenty
seconds
a
day
slower
hence
to
adjust
he
was
obliged
to
shorten
the
pendulum
the
same
fact
was
confirmed
by
halley
while
at
helena
but
an
additional
reason
for
this
variation
is
presumed
to
exist
from
the
machinery
being
further
removed
from
the
central
axis
of
the
earth
the
gravitating
principle
is
presumed
to
be
diminished
at
the
equator
more
than
it
is
when
nearer
the
poles
about
this
time
the
french
jesuit
missionaries
having
got
admission
into
china
contributed
greatly
to
the
improvement
of
their
astronomy
father
schaal
one
of
their
number
on
account
of
his
merit
and
particularly
for
his
skill
in
astronomy
was
so
highly
honoured
by
the
court
of
china
that
the
emperor
upon
his
made
him
preceptor
to
his
son
and
successor
schaal
reformed
the
kalendar
a
matter
of
great
importance
to
that
country
it
was
further
improved
by

succeeded
schaal
about

sir
isaac
newton
was
born
at
woolstrope
in
lincoln
december
after
due
preparation
he
was
admitted
in
the
university
of
cambridge
the
rapidity
of
his
progress
in
mathematical
knowledge
was
truly
astonishing
at
the
age
of
he
had
laid
the
foundation
of
the
most
important
mathematical
discoveries
he
is
the
first
who
gave
a
rational
and
complete
account
of
the
laws
which
regulate
planetary
motion
on
the
principles
of
attraction
and
gravitation
newton
was
as
remarkable
for
a
modest
diffidence
of
his
own
abilities
as
for
the
superiority
of
his
genius
in
he
published
his

he
received
in
his
life
time
the
honour
due
to
his
singular
merit
in

was
elected
president
of

was
introduced
to

he
obtained
and
ever

reckoned
as
the
greatest
honour
and
happiness
of

bishop
of
cloyne
published
his
treatise
called
analyst
in
which
he
attempted
to
charge

this
work
was
the
occasion
of
mac

published
at
edinburgh
in
which
is
reckoned
the
most
ample
treatise
on
that
branch
of
novel
mathematics
which
has
yet
appeared
so
very
eminent
was
mac
skill
in
mathematics
and
the
principles
of
anatomical
science
and
he
possessed
such
excellent
instruments
for
these
purposes
that
a
new
theory
never
appeared
nor
did
anything
transpire
in
the
scientific
world
which
was
uncommon
but
his
friends
constantly
resorted
to
him
for
explanation
and
experiment
and
their
laudable
curiosity
was
sure
to
be
satisfactorily
gratified
one
of
the
greatest
names
in
the
modern
history
of
astronomical
discovery
is
that
of
the
late
sir
william
herschel
and
much
to
his
praise
he
was
in
the
science
in
which
he
earned
his
high
reputation
herschel
was
born
at
hanover
in
and
was
the
son
of
a
musician
in
humble
circumstances
brought
up
to
his
profession
at
the
age
of
fourteen
he
was
placed
in
the
band
of
the
hanoverian
guards
a
detachment
of
this
regiment
having
been
ordered
to
england
in
the
year
he
and
his
father
accompanied
it
but
the
latter
returned
to
germany
in
a
few
months
and
left
his
son
to
try
his
fortune
in
london
for
a
long
time
he
had
many
difficulties
to
contend
with
and
he
passed
several
years
principally
in
giving
lessons
in
music
in
the
different
towns
in
the
north
of
england
at
last
in
through
the
interest
of
a
gentleman
to
whom
his
merits
had
become
known
he
obtained
the
situation
of
organist
at
halifax
and
next
year
having
gone
to
fulfil
a
short
engagement
at
bath
he
gave
so
much
satisfaction
by
his
performances
that
he
was
appointed
to
the
same
office
in
the
octagon
chapel
of
that
city
upon
which
he
went
to
reside
there
the
place
which
he
now
held
was
of
some
value
and
from
the
opportunities
which
he
enjoyed
of
adding
to
its
emoluments
by
engagements
at
the
rooms
and
private
concerts
as
well
as
by
taking
pupils
he
had
had
the
prospect
of
deriving
a
good
income
from
his
profession
if
he
had
made
that
his
only
or
his
chief
object
during
his
residence
at
bath
although
greatly
occupied
with
professional
engagements
the
time
he
devoted
to
his
mathematical
studies
was
surprising
often
we
are
told
after
a
fatiguing
work
of
fourteen
or
sixteen
hours
among
his
pupils
he
would
on
returning
home
at
night
repair
for
relaxation
to
what
many
would
deem
these
severer
exercises
in
this
manner
in
the
course
of
time
he
attained
a
competent
knowledge
of
geometry
and
found
himself
in
a
condition
to
proceed
to
the
study
of
the
different
branches
of
physical
science
which
depend
upon
the
mathematics
among
the
first
of
the
latter
that
attracted
his
attention
were
the
kindred
departments
of
astronomy
and
optics
having
applied
himself
to
these
sciences
he
became
desirous
of
beholding
with
his
own
eyes
those
wonders
of
the
heavens
of
which
he
had
read
so
much
and
for
that
purpose
he
borrowed
from
an
acquaintance
a
gregorian
telescope
this
instrument
interested
him
so
greatly
that
he
determined
to
procure
one
of
his
own
and
commissioned
a
friend
in
london
to
purchase
one
for
him
of
a
somewhat
larger
size
but
he
found
the
price
was
beyond
what
he
could
afford
to
make
up
for
this
disappointment
he
resolved
to
construct
a
telescope
for
himself
and
after
encountering
innumerable
difficulties
in
the
progress
of
his
task
he
at
last
succeeded
in
the
year
in
completing
a
newtonian
reflector
this
was
the
commencement
of
a
long
and
brilliant
course
of
triumphs
in
the
same
walk
of
art
and
also
in
that
of
astronomical
discovery
herschel
now
became
so
much
more
ardently
attached
to
his
philosophical
pursuits
that
regardless
of
the
sacrifice
of
emolument
he
was
making
he
begun
gradually
to
limit
his
professional
engagements
and
the
number
of
his
pupils
meanwhile
he
continued
to
employ
his
leisure
in
the
fabrication
of
still
more
powerful
instruments
than
the
one
he
had
first
constructed
and
in
no
long
time
he
produced
telescopes
of
seven
ten
and
even
twenty
feet
focal
distance
in
fashioning
the
mirrors
for
these
instruments
his
perseverance
was
indefatigable
for
his
reflector
we
have
been
informed
that
he
actually
finished
and
made
trial
of
no
fewer
than
two
hundred
mirrors
before
he
found
one
that
satisfied
him
when
he
sat
down
to
prepare
a
mirror
his
practice
was
to
work
at
it
for
twelve
or
fourteen
hours
without
quitting
his
occupation
for
a
moment
he
would
not
even
take
his
hand
from
what
he
was
about
to
help
himself
to
food
and
the
little
he
ate
on
such
occasions
was
put
into
his
mouth
by
his
sister
he
gave
the
mirror
a
proper
shape
more
by
a
certain
natural
tact
than
by
rule
and
when
his
hand
was
once
in
as
the
phrase
is
he
was
afraid
that
the
perfection
of
the
finish
might
be
impaired
by
the
least
intermission
of
his
labours
it
was
on
the
of
march
that
herschel
made
the
discovery
to
which
he
owes
perhaps
most
of
his
reputation
he
had
been
engaged
for
nearly
a
year
and
a
half
in
making
a
survey
of
the
heavens
when
on
the
evening
of
the
day
that
has
been
mentioned
having
turned
his
reflector
an
excellent
seven
feet
reflector
of
his
own
constructing
to
a
particular
part
of
the
sky
he
observed
among
the
other
stars
one
which
seemed
to
shine
with
a
more
steady
radiance
than
those
around
it
and
on
account
of
that
and
other
peculiarities
in
its
appearance
which
excited
his
suspicions
he
determined
to
observe
it
more
narrowly
on
reverting
to
it
after
some
hours
he
was
a
good
deal
surprised
to
find
that
it
had
perceptibly
changed
its
place
a
fact
which
the
next
day
became
more
indisputable
at
first
he
was
somewhat
in
doubt
whether
or
not
it
was
the
same
star
which
he
had
seen
on
these
different
occasions
but
after
continuing
his
observations
for
a
few
days
longer
all
uncertainty
upon
that
head
vanished
he
now
communicated
what
he
had
observed
to
the
astronomer
royal
who
concluded
the
luminary
could
be
nothing
else
than
a
new
comet
continued
observation
of
it
however
for
a
few
months
dissipated
this
error
and
it
became
evident
that
it
was
in
reality
a
hitherto
undiscovered
planet
this
new
world
so
unexpectedly
found
to
form
a
part
of
the
system
to
which
our
own
belongs
received
from
herschel
the
name
of
the
or
georgian
star
in
honour
of
the
king
of
england
but
by
continental
astronomers
it
has
been
more
generally
called
either
after
its
discoverer
or
subsequent
observations
made
chiefly
by
herschel
himself
have
ascertained
many
particulars
regarding
it
some
of
which
are
well
calculated
to
fill
us
with
astonishment
at
the
powers
of
the
sublime
science
which
can
wing
its
way
so
far
into
the
immensity
of
space
and
bring
us
back
information
so
precise
and
various
in
the
first
place
the
diameter
of
this
new
globe
has
been
found
to
be
nearly
four
and
a
half
times
larger
than
that
of
our
own
its
size
altogether
is
about
eighty
times
that
of
our
earth
its
year
is
as
long
as
of
ours
its
distance
from
the
sun
is
nearly
eighteen
hundred
millions
of
miles
or
more
than
nineteen
times
that
of
the
earth
its
density
as
compared
with
that
of
the
earth
is
nearly
as
to
one
hundred
so
that
its
entire
weight
is
more
than
eighteen
times
that
of
our
planet
finally
the
force
of
gravitation
near
its
surface
is
such
that
falling
bodies
descend
only
through
fourteen
feet
during
the
first
second
instead
of
feet
as
with
us
herschel
afterwards
discovered
no
fewer
than
six
satellites
or
moons
belonging
to
his
new
planet
the
announcement
of
the
discovery
of
the
georgium
sidus
at
once
made
name
universally
known
in
the
course
of
a
few
months
the
king
bestowed
on
him
a
pension
of
three
hundred
pounds
a
year
that
he
might
be
able
entirely
to
relinquish
his
engagements
at
bath
and
upon
this
he
came
to
reside
at
slough
near
windsor
he
now
devoted
himself
entirely
to
science
and
the
construction
of
telescopes
and
observations
of
the
heavens
continued
to
form
the
occupations
of
the
remainder
of
his
life
astronomy
is
indebted
to
him
for
many
other
most
interesting
discoveries
besides
the
celebrated
one
of
which
we
have
just
given
an
account
as
well
as
a
variety
of
speculations
of
the
most
ingenious
original
and
profound
character
but
of
these
we
can
not
here
attempt
any
detail
he
also
introduced
some
important
improvements
into
the
construction
of
the
reflecting
telescope
beside
continuing
to
fabricate
that
instrument
of
dimensions
greatly
exceeding
any
that
had
been
formerly
attempted
with
the
powers
surpassing
in
nearly
a
corresponding
degree
what
had
ever
been
before
obtained
the
largest
telescope
which
he
ever
made
was
his
famous
one
of
forty
feet
long
which
he
erected
at
slough
for
the
king
it
was
begun
about
the
end
of
the
year
and
on
the
of
august
the
enormous
tube
was
poised
on
the
complicated
but
ingeniously
contrived
mechanism
by
which
its
movements
were
to
be
regulated
and
ready
for
use
on
the
same
day
a
new
satellite
of
saturn
was
detected
by
it
being
the
sixth
which
had
been
observed
attendant
upon
that
planet
a
seventh
was
afterwards
discovered
by
means
of
the
same
instrument
this
telescope
has
been
taken
down
and
replaced
by
another
of
only
half
the
length
constructed
by
herschel
the
distinguished
son
of
the
subject
of
our
present
sketch
herschel
himself
eventually
became
convinced
that
no
telescope
could
surpass
in
magnifying
power
one
of
from
twenty
to
feet
in
length
the
french
astronomer
lalande
states
that
he
was
informed
by
george
iii
himself
that
it
was
at
his
desire
that
herschel
was
induced
to
make
the
telescope
at
slough
of
the
extraordinary
length
he
did
his
own
wish
being
that
it
should
not
be
more
than
thirty
feet
long
so
extraordinary
was
the
ardour
of
this
great
astronomer
in
the
study
of
his
favourite
science
that
for
many
years
it
has
been
asserted
he
never
was
in
bed
at
any
hour
during
which
the
stars
were
visible
and
he
made
almost
all
his
observations
whatever
was
the
season
of
the
year
not
under
cover
but
in
his
garden
in
the
open
air
and
generally
without
an
attendant
there
was
much
that
was
peculiar
to
himself
not
only
in
the
process
by
which
he
fabricated
his
telescopes
but
also
in
his
manner
of
using
them
one
of
the
attendants
in
the
observatory
at
richmond
who
had
formerly
been
a
workman
in
establishment
was
forcibly
reminded
on
seeing
herschel
take
an
observation
of
a
remark
which
his
old
master
had
made
having
just
completed
one
of
his
best
telescopes
ramsden
addressing
himself
to
his
workman
said
i
believe
is
the
highest
degree
of
perfection
we
opticians
by
profession
will
ever
arrive
at
if
any
improvement
of
importance
shall
ever
after
this
be
introduced
in
the
making
of
telescopes
it
will
be
by
some
one
who
has
not
been
taught
by
some
years
before
his
death
the
degree
of
was
conferred
upon
herschel
by
the
university
of
oxford
and
in
the
prince
regent
bestowed
upon
him
the
hanoverian
and
guelphic
order
of
knighthood
he
died
on
the
of
august
when
he
was
within
a
few
months
of
having
completed
his
year
we
have
been
thus
particular
in
the
enumeration
of
particulars
in
the
lives
of
those
great
men
who
have
cultivated
this
sublime
science
for
the
purpose
of
availing
ourselves
of
a
suggestion
furnished
by
priestly
who
observed
we
could
only
see
newton
in
two
points
of
his
career
at
the
bottom
of
the
ladder
and
at
the
top
having
left
no
account
of
his
progress
it
appeared
as
though
he
had
broken
the
steps
by
which
he
had
ascended
that
none
should
from
the
facts
collected
by
the
many
eminent
men
whose
names
have
ornamented
our
pages
we
are
enabled
to

that

luminous
belt
at
a
great
distance
from

saturn
also

a
comparative
idea
of
the
extent
of
the
works
of
omnipotence
may
be
perhaps
collected
on
our
being
informed
that
the
sphere
where
the
fixed
stars
appear
is
presumed
to
be
placed
far
beyond
the
most
remote
planetary
orbit
and
that
some
of
them
are
supposed
to
serve
as
suns
to
illumine
other
systems
or
worlds
to
us
unknown
navigation
the
sacred
records
inform
us
that
the
ark
of
noah
was
the
first
ship
and
produced
by
the
invention
of
the
great
architect
of
nature
himself
and
some
men
have
so
believed
says
the
learned
and
ingenious
sir
walter
raleigh
in
his
of
the
world
it
is
certain
the
world
was
planted
before
the
flood
which
could
not
be
performed
without
some
transporting
vessels
it
is
true
and
the
success
has
proved
that
there
was
not
any
so
capacious
nor
any
so
strong
as
to
defend
themselves
against
so
violent
and
so
continued
a
pouring
down
of
rain
as
the
ark
of
which
noah
was
the
builder
from
the
invention
of
god
himself
of
what
fashion
or
fabric
soever
were
the
rest
with
all
men
they
perished
according
to
the
ordinance
of
and
it
appears
extremely
probable
that
those
testimonials
whereof
ovid
speaks
of
former
existence
were
remains
of
ships
wrecked
at
the
general
flood
there
can
be
no
question
that
the
syrians
were
the
first
maritime
power
in
the
world
as
well
in
point
of
time
as
importance
but
of
what
species
of
construction
their
vessels
were
we
are
not
informed
their
merchants
trading
to
the
eastern
indies
as
they
did
for
solomon
to
ophir
whence
they
brought
gold
and
also
to
this
country
for
tin
and
their
having
made
three
distinct
descents
upon
america
will
enable
us
to
maintain
this
our
opinion
after
them
the
greeks
a
people
living
chiefly
on
the
shores
of
the
hellespont
and
ægean
seas
with
many
islands
in
the
mediterranean
adriatic
and
archipelagion
seas
besides
their
possessions
in
asia
minor
and
their
commerce
with
the
european
continent
obtained
the
next
power
by
sea
we
read
indeed
that
minos
the
famous
cretan
sovereign
and
legislator
who
lived
two
descents
before
the
trojan
war
sent
out
shipping
to
free
the
grecian
seas
of
pirates
which
shows
as
sir
walter
raleigh
ingeniously
infers
that
there
had
been
trade
and
war
upon
the
waters
before
his
time
also
the
next
in
point
of
time
and
importance
on
record
was
the
highly
renowned
expedition
of
the
argonauts
for
the
golden
fleece
to
colchis
a
country
of
asia
on
the
euxine
sea
immediately
after
this
was
the
colonization
of
cyrene
in
africa
by
battus
one
of
the
companions
of
jason
in
his
colchian
expedition
shortly
afterwards
the
grecian
states
united
against
phrygian
treachery
and
the
abuse
of
grecian
hospitality
forming
another
most
memorable
epoch
in
the
history
of
the
world
we
are
informed
the
grecian
neptune
or
as
mythology
styles
him
a
god
of
the
saturnian
family
for
the
great
service
he
did
his
father
saturn
or
noah
against
the
titans
had
the
seas
given
to
him
history
informs
us
that
the
first
inventor
of
rowing
vessels
was
a
citizen
of
corinth
and
likewise
that
the
first
naval
war
was
between
the
samians
and
corcyrians
the
history
of
ithicus
translated
into
latin
by
jerome
affirms
that
griphon
the
scythian
was
the
inventor
of

strabo
also
gives
the
honour
of
the
invention
of
the
anchor
to
another
scythian
the
famous
anacharsis
whilst
greece
herself
by
her
historians
ascribes
its
invention
to
eupolemus
also
it
is
said
that
icarus
invented
the

other

the
specification
of
such
other
imperfect
memoirs
many
of
fabulous
appearance
may
be
of
no
great
importance
it
appears
certain
that
among
the
four
sons
of
javan
the
son
of
japhet
the
grandson
and
other
the
posterity
of
noah
who
peopled
the
of
the
gentiles
the
grecian
islands
must
long
before
the
days
of
minos
have
used
those
seas
from
the
insular
nature
of
their
inhabitants
and
it
certainly
does
not
appear
extravagant
to
us
to
presume
that
this
people
were
among
the
first
who
navigated
the
seas
mankind
in
various
parts
of
the
world
being
stimulated
by
the
same
necessities
urged
by
the
same
wants
and
possessing
the
same
means
might
probably
produce
similar
inventions
to
each
other
most
indeed
had
occasion
to
navigate
lakes
and
cross
rivers
they
accordingly
constructed
such
machines
as
would
answer
their
purpose
of
passage
or
migration
so
were
rafts
and
canoes
formed
of
canes
osiers
twigs
where
they
grew
which
they
fashioned
like
boats
and
then
covered
with
skins
of
various
animals
others
formed
rafts
of
wood
whilst
some
others
fashioned
canoes
having
hollowed
out
trees
for
that
purpose
one
way
or
other
each
people
thus
possessed
a
marine
proper
for
their
purpose
it
is
true
but
in
various
degrees
of
excellence
this
was
the
case
with
greeks
as
well
as
barbarians
of
all
nations
all
these
people
excepting
the
immediate
descendants
of
noah
might
perhaps
lay
a
feasible
claim
to
the
honour
of
the
original
invention
of
these
articles
and
having
never
seen
such
they
virtually
have
each
a
good
title
to
the
distinction
indeed
many
of
them
might
have
taken
the
idea
for
such
invention
from
the
policy
of
certain
animals
and
the
nature
of
others
to
instance
the
sagacity
of
the
beaver
and
his
raft
and
the
little
nautilus
with
his
swelling
sail
hence
they
might
have
adopted
from
that
animal
and
that
piscatory
insect
the
idea
of
a
raft
and
also
of
a
vessel
with
a
sail
in
latter
days
we
find
the
teutonic
saxons
first
came
to
this
country
according
to
turner
the
historian
in
vessels
they
called
by
sir
walter
raleigh
marine
vessels
have
borne
a
variety
of
names
as
well
as
of
numerous
figures
from
the
gondola
of
the
venetian
to
the
canoe
of
the
esquimaux
the
british
to
the
ponderous
bonaventure
in
which
the
doge
annually
espouses
the
sea
all
those
nations
too
through
whose
hands
the
maritime
power
has
passed
from
time
to
time
as
they
have
been
instructed
by
experience
or
taught
by
necessity
might
repeatedly
have
made
additions
and
improvements
in
naval
architecture
some
calculated
for
mercantile
utility
while
others
have
only
attended
to
warlike
strength
and
some
to
answer
both
purposes
like
our
indiamen
but
now
the
british
navy
being
supplied
with
the
best
materials
and
having
as
ingenious
workmen
as
any
with
the
addition
of
the
warlike
children
of
the
soil
may
openly
defy
all
nations
and
proudly
claim
the
sovereignty
of
the
seas
where
her
flag
has
been
flying
the
battle
and
the
breeze
for
so
many
years
but
the
most
important
improvement
in
navigation
propelling
vessels
by
steam
has
been
left
to
our
own
times
the
was
first
applied
to
small
vessels
for
the
coasting
or
river
trade
but
it
has
now
increased
to
vessels
of
the
largest
size
in
fact
the
most
part
of
the
british
navy
are
steamships
in
former
times
before
the
introduction
of
this
valuable
auxiliary
the
passage
between
england
and
america
was
tedious
and
uncertain
sometimes
taking
months
but
rarely
less
than
from
four
to
six
weeks
according
to
the
state
of
the
weather
but
now
the
case
is
altered
there
are
a
regular
line
of
steamships
one
of
which
leaves
liverpool
every
week
and
the
voyage
is
performed
with
almost
positive
certainty
in
from
twelve
to
fourteen
days
independent
of
the
rude
boreas
or
the
boisterous
atlantic
these
vessels
are
of
the
largest
size
and
handsomely
fitted
up
for
the
accommodation
of
passengers
a

building
or
erected
on

serve
as

to
mariners
on
a
low
coast
by
day
and
in
any
situation
to
inform
them
of
their
approach
to
land
in
the
night
being
of
most
essential
utility
in
causing
them
to
take

avoid

rocks
or
else
it
is
a
building
erected
on
a
rock
in
the
sea
which
from
its
situation
would
be
extremely
dangerous
to
vessels
were
not
some
intimation
given
of
the
existence
of
a
rock
where
it
is
locally
situated
of
this
latter
description
is
the
celebrated
eddystone
off
plymouth
although
this
species
of
architecture
is
not
likely
to
have
been
so
general
in
extreme
antiquity
because
it
could
not
have
been
essentially
necessary
to
any
except
to
those
nations
who
from
the
proximity
of
their
situation
to
the
coast
or
other
circumstances
pursued
maritime
concerns
or
to
those
whose
connexions
rendered
the
encouragement
of
the
marine
of
other
nations
important
the
oldest
building
of
this
description
which
we
believe
to
be
upon
record
is
the
famous
pharos
erected
on
the
egyptian
coast
which
being
very
low
land
and
exposed
entirely
to
the
almost
constant
west
winds
coming
up
the
mediterranean
from
the
vast
atlantic
must
of
necessity
have
made
the
port
of
modern
alexandria
anciently
called
dalmietta
very
dangerous
it
was
originally
erected
by
ptolemy
philadelphus
for
the
encouragement
and
convenience
of
the
phœnicians
who
were
accounted
the
foreign
factors
of
that
empire
as
the
egyptians
possessed
an
unconquerable
aversion
to
the
sea
and
therefore
they
never
obtained
its
sovereignty
whilst
the
former
people
were
the
first
who
obtained
the
supremacy
of
that
sea
the
island
upon
which
pharos
stood
in
the
time
of
homer
in
his
simple
geography
and
estimation
was
said
to
be
one
sail
from
the
delta
whereas
since
the
foundation
of
alexandria
it
was
only
a
mile
in
distance
and
was
even
joined
to
the
mainland
by
a
mole
having
a
bridge
at
each
end
or
according
to
some
authors
in
the
middle
the
tower
was
if
report
be
true
justly
entitled
to
the
appellation
it
obtained
one
of
the
seven
wonders
of
the
world
and
it
is
reported
that
the
light
from
it
has
been
seen
at
the
distance
of
a
hundred
miles
which
assuredly
appears
improbable
because
the
convexity
of
the
earth
we
think
would
not
permit
its
height
must
have
been
at
least
feet
or
yards
from
the
base
we
are
enabled
to
furnish
the
following
particulars
of
this
famous
structure
it
was
built
by
order
of
that
patron
of
learning
and
the
arts
ptolemy
philadelphus
by
that
eminent
architect
sostrates
who
constructed
many
of
the
public
buildings
in
alexandria
it
is
said
to
have
cost
ptolemy
eight
hundred
talents
respecting
its
mode
of
construction
it
was
raised
several
stories
one
above
another
each
was
decorated
with
columns
balustrades
and
galleries
of
the
finest
marble
and
most
exquisite
workmanship
and
some
have
even
said
that
the
architect
had
furnished
the
galleries
with
large
mirrors
by
which
shipping
could
be
seen
at
a
great
distance
however
respecting
this
edifice
once
so
famous
that
its
very
name
pharos
was
considered
as
a
common
term
for
all
other
constructions
for
the
same
purpose
it
is
now
said
from
saracenic
ignorance
and
brutality
aided
perhaps
by
the
assistance
of
the
common
leveller
time
that
nothing
now
remains
of
this
once
elegant
edifice
but
an
unsightly
tower
rising
out
of
a
heap
of
ruins
the
whole
being
accommodated
to
the
inequality
of
the
ground
on
which
it
stands
and
being
at
present
no
higher
than
that
which
it
should
command
such
as
it
is
there
is
now
a
light
we
understand
usually
maintained
there
is
also
an
island
which
was
called
pharos
in
the
adriatic
sea
on
the
coast
of
italy
opposite
brundusium
for
the
same
reason
likewise
the
celebrated
colossal
statue
of
apollo
at
rhodes
answered
the
same
purpose
and
occasionally
had
the
same
appellation
as
had
a
river
of
asia
in
the
environs
of
cilicia
and
the
euphrates
this
last
consideration
brings
us
to
the
etymology
of
the
word
as
ozanum
says
originally
signified
a
strait
as
the
pharos
of
of
every
description
of
yet
known
there
is
none
more
famous
than
that
called
eddystone
with
a
description
of
which
we
shall
conclude
this
article
was
begun
upon
the
eddystone
rock
in
and
was
more
than
four
years
in
building
from
the
numerous
interruptions
of
the
wind
and
the
element
he
had
to
contend
with
the
violence
whereof
is
truly
alarming
occasioned
by
that
rock
being
exposed
to
every
wind
which
comes
up
the
vast
atlantic
and
that
tumultuous
sea
the
bay
of
biscay
these
obstacles
were
considerably
increased
by
the
shape
of
the
rock
itself
having
a
regular
slope
to
and
from
the
very
deep
sea
in
its
vicinity
it
therefore
receives
the
uncontrolled
fury
of
those
seas
meeting
with
no
other
object
whereon
to
break
their
vehement
force
the
effect
is
so
great
at
high
water
with
a
wind
which
continues
for
many
days
though
a
calm
may
have
succeeded
the
violent
action
of
the
waters
has
not
ceased
but
break
frightfully
on
eddystone
an
engraving
of
was
published
at
the
period
of
its
erection
from
which
it
appears
to
have
been
a
stone
tower
of
twelve
sides
rising
feet
above
the
highest
point
of
the
rock
which
in
the
dimensions
on
which
it
was
built
feet
in
diameter
was
ten
feet
lower
on
one
side
than
it
was
upon
the
other
at
the
top
was
a
balustrade
and
platform
upon
this
were
erected
eight
pillars
which
supported
a
dome
of
the
same
dimensions
as
the
tower
from
the
top
of
which
arose
an
octagon
tower
of
a
diameter
of
fifteen
feet
and
seven
in
height
on
the
summit
was
placed
the
lantern
ten
feet
in
diameter
and
twelve
in
height
it
had
a
gallery
surrounding
it
which
gave
access
to
the
windows
the
whole
was
surrounded
by
fencible
the
entry
was
by
a
solid
stone
door
at
the
bottom
the
whole
building
was
of
the
same
material
except
the
aperture
for
the
staircase
at
the
bottom
was
a
room
twelve
feet
high
for
a
the
next
story
was
of
the
same
height
which
was
the
stateroom
and
the
third
was
of
a
similar
height
which
was
the
kitchen
those
compartments
occupied
the
whole
height
to
the
platform
the
dome
above
this
contained
the
the
octagon
above
it
the
the
reason
why
it
occupied
so
much
time
in
building
was
because
the
men
could
only
work
in
the
summer
months
the
first
summer
was
occupied
in
making
holes
in
the
rock
and
fastening
irons
to
hold
the
future
work
the
second
year
was
spent
in
erecting
a
solid
pillar
of
fourteen
feet
diameter
and
one
hundred
and
twelve
feet
high
for
the
future
support
of
the
building
the
third
year
it
was
augmented
in
diameter
and
increased
in
height
this
building
was
eventually
finished
within
the
time
at
an
enormous
expense
it
stood
the
opposition
of
the
elements
the
violence
of
the
sea
was
so
great
that
winstanley
said
it
has
been
seen
to
rise
upwards
of
one
hundred
feet
above
the
vane
whilst
the
sides
of
the
building
were
covered
with
surf
as
with
a
sheet
so
that
the
whole
house
and
lantern
were
occasionally
under
water
this
edifice
withstood
the
conflict
of
elements
till
when
the
architect
being
at
plymouth
and
desirous
of
visiting
it
for
the
purpose
of
inspecting
some
repairs
went
to
it
but
returned
no
more
for
a
storm
arose
which
left
not
a
relic
of
it
standing
except
the
iron
work
which
had
been
fixed
in
the
rock
the
corporation
of
the
trinity
house
had
then
to
erect
another
for
which
purpose
they
employed
a
john
rudyard
who
was
a
silk
mercer
on
mechanical
ingenuity
was
said
to
have
qualified
him
well
for
the
undertaking
it
appears
that
he
erected
a
house
made
chiefly
of
wood
which
presented
many
traits
of
his
genius
it
was
a
conical
frustrum
one
hundred
and
feet
in
diameter
at
the
base
its
altitude
feet
at
the
top
of
the
building
was
a
balcony
railed
round
in
the
centre
of
its
area
was
the
lantern
this
building
was
made
quite
plain
excepting
the
well
for
the
staircase
which
was
solid
for
feet
in
the
centre
a
strong
mast
was
erected
the
building
was
admirably
fixed
to
the
rock
from
the
very
peculiar
manner
of
making
the
holes
to
hold
iron
cramps
they
being
made
for
the
internal
cavity
to
diverge
on
each
side
by
an
extreme
of
one
inch
at
the
depth
of
sixteen
inches
the
cavity
was
first
filled
with
tallow
the
hot
iron
then
dipped
in
the
same
substance
put
in
the
rock
and
eventually
filled
with
pewter
which
displaced
the
tallow
being
heavier
the
grease
serving
to
protect
the
iron
from
the
corrosive
acidity
of
the
salt
water
in
it
was
finished
so
far
as
to
receive
a
temporary
light
it
stood
years
and
showed
that
it
was
liable
to
destruction
from
the
very
perishable
nature
of
its
materials
however
on
the
december
the
upper
part
of
it
taking
fire
burnt
downwards
to
its
entire
consumption
the
concern
had
been
leased
to
a
captain
lovell
but
at
a
later
period
his
possessions
were
distributed
among
a
number
of
people
when
the
care
of
rebuilding
it
was
entrusted
to
robert
weston
to
whom
john
smeaton
was
recommended
by
the
president
of
the
royal
society
who
appears
to
have
been
well
qualified
for
the
undertaking
he
accordingly
furnished
a
plan
for
and
superintended
the
building
which
now
stands
conjecture
was
quite
different
to
that
of
the
late
projector
he
conceived
that
nothing
could
withstand
the
action
of
the
wind
and
water
so
well
and
at
the
same
time
prevent
such
accidents
as
the
past
as
could
a
building
whose
gravity
should
secure
its
most
sure
protection
he
accordingly
constructed
his
of
the
most
massy
stones
all
dovetailed
into
each
other
formed
of
and
portland
stone
all
the
joints
breach
each
other
as
the
masons
term
it
or
on
each
joint
occurs
the
central
stone
of
the
next
course
there
are
fourteen
courses
of
these
stones
first
laid
in
this
manner
of
a
great
thickness
each
course
on
the
june
the
first
stone
was
laid
in
its
place
each
stone
being
pierced
when
it
was
laid
a
strong
oak
pin
was
driven
through
to
pin
it
fast
to
its
place
the
dovetails
not
fitting
so
close
to
each
other
because
it
was
necessary
to
leave
some
space
for
the
cement
this
pin
was
calculated
to
secure
the
stone
till
this
could
be
applied
and
had
fixed
the
cement
used
was
composed
of
watchet
lime
and
or
dutch
terras
being
made
at
the
moment
by
mixing
up
in
a
pail
with
water
this
mixture
was
poured
upon
the
work
and
run
into
every
cavity
and
crevice
this
however
was
sometimes
not
exempt
from
the
injury
of
the
sea
whenever
it
was
injured
the
defect
was
supplied
by
having
some
oakum
cut
fine
and
mixed
with
this
cement
introduced
into
the
joints
then
they
were
secured
with
a
coat
of
plaster
of
paris
and
this
was
never
known
to
fail
if
the
work
stood
for
one
tide
in
this
manner
the
platform
was
erected
all
of
the
most
solid
materials
and
substantial
workmanship
on
the
of
september
the
work
having
been
continued
from
the
of
the
preceding
may
had
arrived
at
the
floor
here
an
iron
chain
was
let
into
the
stone
as
follows
the
recess
being
made
and
the
chain
being
well
oiled
before
insertion
the
groove
which
received
it
was
divided
into
four
separate
dams
by
clay
two
kettles
were
used
to
hold
a
sufficiency
of
melted
lead
eleven
hundred
weight
whilst
the
lead
was
in
a
state
of
fusion
two
men
with
ladles
filled
one
quarter
of
the
groove
as
soon
as
it
set
they
removed
one
of
the
clay
dams
and
then
filled
the
next
quarter
pouring
the
liquid
on
the
middle
of
the
first
quarter
it
melted
together
into
the
second
the
dam
at
the
opposite
end
was
now
filled
and
then
the
fourth
by
this
means
the
lead
was
associated
into
one
solid
mass
the
centring
for
the
floor
was
next
set
up
the
outward
stones
being
first
set
and
then
the
inner
ones
thus
the
base
floor
was
finished
the
men
could
work
no
longer
than
till
the
of
october
that
year
the
winter
was
spent
in
preparing
the
iron
copper
and
glass
work
for
the
lantern
and
the
spring
in
unsuccessful
endeavours
to
discover
the
moorings
for
the
vessel
which
attended
the
works
for
the
occasional
retreat
of
the
workmen
on
the
of
july
the
work
was
resumed
the
stones
for
building
had
been
hitherto
raised
from
the
boats
by
what
are
called
shears
formed
of
two
poles
with
the
lowermost
ends
extended
to
a
sufficient
width
whilst
the
upper
ends
met
in
a
point
here
was
fastened
tackle
pulleys
to
raise
them
to
a
sufficient
height
to
be
swung
over
the
building
this
course
was
now
of
necessity
altered
a
block
with
pulleys
being
suspended
from
the
top
projected
to
a
sufficient
distance
supported
by
beams
after
the
base
had
been
formed
as
described
a
different
mode
of
operation
was
necessary
to
complete
the
superstructure
the
work
being
now
advanced
so
high
as
to
be
out
of
the
constant
wash
of
the
sea
instead
of
grooves
being
formed
to
fasten
the
stones
together
they
were
fixed
by
means
of
iron
clamps
and
lead
the
stones
to
complete
the
superstructure
were
landed
and
first
drawn
up
by
machinery
called
a
through
the
well
in
the
interior
of
the
building
being
a
cavity
for
the
staircase
the
work
now
proceeded
more
rapidly
so
that
by
the
of
august
the
stairs
and
all
the
masonry
were
finished
the
iron
frame
for
the
lantern
was
next
screwed
together
in
its
place
and
the
lantern
soon
completed
it
should
have
been
noticed
that
after
the
first
entry
was
closed
the
shears
were
supported
by
a
tackle
called
a
attached
to
the
top
of
the
shears
and
hooked
so
far
on
the
outside
of
the
building
the
stone
being
drawn
up
by
a
windlass
the
guy
was
drawn
in
to
swing
the
stone
over
the
building
the
balcony
rails
and
the
stone
basement
for
the
lantern
having
been
completed
on
the
of
september
the
cupola
was
set
up
by
a
particular
kind
of
shears
constructed
purposely
the
guy
in
different
places
being
fastened
to
booms
projecting
from
the
several
windows
of
the
upper
rooms
the
next
day
the
ball
was
screwed
on
and
on
the
of
october
an
electrical
conductor
was
fixed
which
finished
the
edifice
a
light
was
then
exhibited
which
has
continued
to
warn
the
mariner
ever
since
an
ably
constructed
cornice
throws
the
spray
from
off
the
building
so
that
it
is
often
seen
at
plymouth
with
the
appearance
of
a
white
sheet
throwing
itself
to
double
the
height
of
the
building
which
from
low
water
mark
to
the
apex
of
the
ball
is
one
hundred
feet
we
have
been
thus
minute
because
this
pharos
is
considered
to
be
the
best
constructed
of
all
our
lighthouses
electricity
electricity
was
a
property
but
imperfectly
understood
by
the
ancients
indeed
it
has
been
said
they
were
entirely
unacquainted
with
it
but
we
propose
shortly
to
show
the
extent
to
which
we
are
informed
their
sphere
of
knowledge
extended
this
much
can
not
be
denied
that
they
were
acquainted
with
the
electrical
properties
of
amber
of
which
fact
we
are
informed
by
pliny
even
before
pliny
however
as
early
as
the
days
of
thalis
who
lived
near
six
hundred
years
anterior
to
the
roman
historian
the
miletine
philosophers
ascribed
the
attractive
power
of
the
magnet
and
of
amber
to
animation
by
a
vital
principle
our
word
appears
to
be
derived
from
the
name
the
latins
gave
to
amber
it
is
also
evident
that
they
were
acquainted
with
the
shock
of
the
torpedo
although
they
were
ignorant
as
are
the
moderns
of
the
concealed
cause
of
this
effect
it
has
been
asserted
that
the
ancients
knew
how
to
collect
the
electrical
fire
in
the
atmosphere
and
it
is
also
said
that
it
was
in
an
experiment
of
this
nature
that
tullus
hostilius
lost
his
life
etymologists
have
carried
us
still
farther
back
and
assert
that
it
was
from
the
electrical
property
in
the
heavens
that
jove
obtained
his
surname
of
jupiter
this
however
may
be
only
conjectural
the
first
discoveries
made
of
sufficient
importance
to
demand
the
appellation
of
in
the
science
of
electricity
were
effected
by
gilbert
the
result
of
which
he
gave
the
world
in
the
year
in
a
book
then
published
entitled
magneto
and
gilbert
was
followed
in
his
pursuits
by
that
celebrated
scientific
character
the
honourable
and
illustrious
boyle
and
other
men
eminent
for
that
species
of
information
this
science
was
successfully
cultivated
in
the
last
century
by
many
eminent
philosophers
among
whom
we
may
mention
hawkesbee
grey
muschenbrook
doctors
franklin
and
priestly
bishop
watson
cavendish
and
several
other
members
of
the
royal
society
of
england
whilst
those
worthy
of
the
true
philosophic
character
in
france
did
not
neglect
its
cultivation
many
fatal
accidents
have
resulted
from
experiments
made
by
people
ignorant
of
the
science
on
the
of
august
at
petersburg
professor
richmann
lost
his
life
by
endeavouring
to
draw
the
electric
fluid
into
his
house
electricity
like
many
others
of
the
arcana
of
nature
still
retains
almost
as
deeply
shaded
from
human
view
as
when
its
existence
was
first
made
known
nature
appears
to
have
certain
secret
operations
which
are
not
yet
perhaps
to
be
revealed
electric
telegraph
this
is
the
most
surprising
invention
of
modern
times
and
of
the
greatest
importance
to
a
commercial
people
by
means
of
it
intelligence
is
conveyed
from
one
end
of
the
kingdom
to
another
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
a
company
was
fully
organised
for
the
carrying
out
this
invention
which
commenced
its
operations
in
and
established
a
system
of
no
ordinary
complication
and
extent
their
wires
stretch
from
glasgow
on
the
north
to
dorchester
on
the
south
from
the
east
coast
at
yarmouth
to
the
west
at
liverpool
these
have
brought
upwards
of
one
hundred
and
fifty
towns
into
instant
communication
with
each
other
the
wires
set
up
for
the
use
of
the
public
alone
are
upwards
of
nine
thousand
eight
hundred
miles
in
length
and
extend
over
a
distance
of
two
thousand
and
sixty
miles
and
exclusive
of
those
running
underground
and
through
tunnels
or
rivers
are
stretched
on
no
fewer
than
thousand
eight
hundred
posts
varying
from
sixteen
to
thirty
feet
in
height
and
of
an
average
square
of
eight
inches
with
an
expensive
apparatus
of
insulators
and
winders
attached
to
each
as
the
most
trifling
derangement
of
the
wires
or
apparatus
will
stop
the
communication
it
is
obvious
that
the
utmost
care
and
watchfulness
is
requisite
to
prevent
and
detect
accidents
accordingly
the
whole
distance
is
divided
into
districts
each
district
having
a
superintendent
and
under
him
several
inspectors
and
a
staff
of
workmen
batterymen
and
mechanics
more
or
less
numerous
according
to
the
extent
over
which
he
when
we
consider
these
things
in
conjunction
with
the
central
staff
of
engineers
secretaries
at
the
in
london
a
maximum
charge
of
one
penny
per
mile
can
not
be
considered
an
exorbitant
demand
for
the
accommodation
afforded
to
the
public
in
keeping
open
so
many
receiving
stations
and
the
maintenance
of
the
expensive
establishments
the
telegraphic
system
is
designed
for
important
and
urgent
messages
and
it
may
be
safely
averred
that
not
one
despatch
in
a
hundred
has
been
as
yet
forwarded
by
it
which
has
not
been
by
many
times
worth
more
than
the
sum
paid
by
the
sender
a
commercial
house
in
liverpool
will
scarcely
grudge
for
a
communication
by
which
a
necessary
payment
may
be
made
an
important
order
given
or
a
profitable
operation
facilitated
in
london
and
the
message
from

which
traverses
a
distance
of

twenty
miles
in
an
instant
to
summon
a
son
from
the
metropolis
it
may
be
to
the
bedside
of
a
dying
parent
can
not
be
judged
exorbitant
at
a
charge
of
considerably
less
than
one
halfpenny
per

wilmer
and
smith
of
liverpool
publishers
of
the
times
have
arranged
the
most
admirable
code
of

in
the
world
and
by
the
use
of
letters
are
capable
of
transmitting
intelligence
equal
to
half
a
column
of
an
ordinary
newspaper
the
telegraphic
company
disapprove
of
this
species
of
and
therefore
charge
for
the

this
wilmer

consider
excessive
as
they
have
forwarded
similar
messages
by

four
thousand
miles
in

from
philadelphia
to

for
these
gentlemen
therefore
consider
they
have
cause
to
find
fault
with
the
company
in
reference
to
charges
for
communications
in
cipher
the
is
one
of
the
most
important
of
human
discoveries
and
is
certainly
one
of
those
which
afford
the
greatest
portion
of
ease
and
advantage
to
the
human
species
as
well
in
the
operation
of
its
cause
as
in
its
ultimate
effects
the
most
powerful
of
machines
had
its
origin
from
the
single
idea
of
one
individual
of
our
own
nation
it
has
been
from
time
to
time
improved
by
different
individuals
also
natives
of
britain
the
precise
period
of
which
improvements
can
be
traced
and
their
effects
fortunately
ascertained
although
we
should
observe
that
the
first
principle
of
this
mechanical
power
was
discovered
by
some
of
the
ancient
nations
many
ages
before
that
which
gave
the
origin
to
the
present
practised
invention
but
from
the
state
of
information
it
is
conceived
to
answer
no
purpose
of
utility
it
may
be
said
to
have
occurred
in
a
small
machine
which
the
ancients
called
an
the
bull
of
æolus
consisting
of
a
hollow
ball
of
metal
with
a
slender
neck
or
pipe
also
of
metal
having
a
small
orifice
entering
into
the
ball
by
means
of
a
screw
this
pipe
being
taken
out
the
ball
being
filled
with
water
and
the
pipe
again
screwed
in
the
ball
is
heated
there
issues
from
the
orifice
when
sufficiently
hot
a
vapour
with
great
violence
and
noise
care
was
required
that
this
should
not
be
by
accident
stopped
if
it
were
the
machine
would
infallibly
burst
and
perhaps
to
the
danger
of
the
lives
of
all
in
its
vicinity
so
immense
is
its
power
another
way
of
introducing
the
water
was
first
to
heat
the
ball
when
empty
and
then
suddenly
to
immerse
it
in
water
descartes
in
particular
has
used
this
instrument
to
account
for
the
natural
generation
of
winds
chauvin
thinks
it
might
be
employed
instead
of
bellows
to
blow
a
fire
it
would
admirably
serve
to
fumigate
a
room
being
filled
with
perfume
instead
of
common
water
it
is
said
to
have
been
applied
to
clear
chimneys
of
their
soot
a
practice
still
alleged
to
be
common
in
italy
plott
in
his
of
staffordshire
records
this
singular
custom
where
the
æolipila
is
used
to
blow
the
fire
lord
of
the
mannor
of
essington
is
bound
by
his
tenure
to
drive
a
goose
every
new
day
three
times
round
the
hall
of
the
lord
of
hilton
while
jack
of
hilton
a
brazen
æolipila
blows
the
the
last
circumstance
we
shall
mention
of
this
instrument
has
relation
to
an
antique
one
discovered
whilst
digging
the
basingstoke
canal
representing
a
grotesque
metallic
figure
in
which
the
blast
proceeded
from
the
mouth
this
figure
is
now
in
the
possession
of
the
society
of
antiquaries
of
london
in
this
instrument
the
uncommon
elastic
force
of
steam
was
recognised
before
the
suggestion
of
the
marquis
of
worcester
which
follows
or
subsequent
thereto
the
marquis
of
worcester
published
the
earliest
account
of
the
application
of
this
power
for
the
purposes
of
utility
and
suggested
it
as
applicable
to
raising
water
an
admirable
and
most
forcible
way
to
drive
up
water
by
fire
not
by
drawing
or
sucking
it
upwards
for
that
would
be
what
the
philosopher
calleth
it
spherum
which
is
but
at
such
a
distance
but
this
way
has
no
bounder
if
the
vessel
be
strong
enough
for
i
have
taken
a
whole
piece
of
cannon
whereof
the
end
was
burst
stopping
and
screwing
up
the
broken
end
as
also
the
and
making
a
constant
fire
under
it
within
hours
it
burst
and
made
a
great
crack
so
that
having
a
way
to
make
my
vessels
so
that
they
are
strengthened
by
the
force
within
them
and
the
one
to
fill
after
the
other
i
have
seen
the
water
run
like
a
constant
fountain
stream
forty
feet
high
one
vessel
of
cold
water
being
consumed
another
begins
to
force
and
refill
with
cold
water
and
so
successively
the
fire
being
tended
and
kept
constant
which
the
person
may
likewise
abundantly
perform
in
the
interim
between
the
necessity
of
turning
the
the
ingenuity
did
not
it
appears
meet
with
that
attention
which
it
deserved
from
those
to
whom
his
communication
was
addressed
in
the
article
of
steam
it
has
been
since
very
much
improved
and
is
acted
upon
for
the
most
useful
of
purposes
also
his
ideas
for
telegraphs
floating
baths
escutcheons
for
locks
moulds
for
candles
and
a
mode
to
disengage
horses
from
a
carriage
after
they
have
taken
fright
which
with
several
others
proclaim
the
originality
and
ingenuity
of
the
mind
of
this
nobleman
an
honour
which
very
few
of
the
british
nobility
aspire
to
since
his
time
another
design
upon
the
same
principle
has
been
projected
by
captain
thomas
savery
a
commissioner
of
sick
and
wounded
who
in
the
year
obtained
a
patent
for
new
invention
for
raising
water
and
occasioning
motion
to
all
sorts
of
by
the
impellant
force
of
this
patent
bears
date
the
of
july
sixteenth
of
william
the
patent
states
that
the
invention
will
be
of
great
use
for
drawing
of
mines
serving
towns
with
water
and
working
all
sorts
of
mills
savery
june
entertained
the
royal
society
with
showing
a
model
of
his
engine
for
raising
water
by
help
of
fire
which
he
set
to
work
before
them
the
experiment
succeeded
according
to
the
above
memoir
is
accompanied
with
a
copperplate
figure
with
references
by
way
of
description
from
whence
it
appears
that
the
engine
then
shown
by
captain
savery
was
for
raising
water
not
only
by
the
expansive
force
of
steam
like
the
marquis
of
but
also
by
the
condensation
of
steam
the
water
being
raised
by
the
pressure
of
a
rarified
atmosphere
to
a
given
height
by
the
expansive
force
of
steam
in
the
same
manner
as
the
marquis
proposed
this
action
was
performed
alternately
in
two
receivers
so
that
while
the
vacuum
formed
in
one
was
drawing
up
water
from
the
well
the
pressure
of
steam
in
the
other
was
forcing
up
water
into
the
reservoir
but
both
receivers
being
supplied
by
one
and
one
the
engine
could
be
made
to
keep
a
continual
stream
so
as
to
suffer
very
little
interruption
this
engine
of
captain
displays
much
ingenuity
and
is
almost
as
perfect
in
its
contrivance
as
the
same
engine
has
been
made
since
his
time
we
regret
that
without
a
figure
we
can
not
supply
a
perfect
description
of
it
however
it
appears
that
it
was
necessary
to
have
two
boilers
or
vessels
of
copper
one
large
and
the
other
smaller
those
boilers
have
a
inserted
into
the
smaller
boiler
within
about
eight
inches
of
its
bottom
and
about
the
centre
of
the
side
of
the
larger
boiler
the
small
boiler
must
be
quite
full
of
water
and
the
larger
one
only
about
full
the
fire
is
then
to
be
lighted
beneath
the
larger
boiler
to
make
the
water
boil
by
which
means
the
steam
being
confined
will
be
greatly
compressed
and
will
therefore
on
opening
a
way
for
it
to
issue
out
which
is
done
by
pushing
the
handle
of
a
regulator
from
the
operator
rush
with
great
violence
through
a
into
a
receiver
driving
out
all
the
air
before
it
sending
it
up
into
a
through
a
clack
as
may
be
perceived
from
its
noise
when
the
air
is
expelled
the
receiver
will
be
very
much
heated
by
the
steam
when
it
is
thoroughly
emptied
of
atmospheric
air
and
grown
very
hot
which
may
be
both
seen
and
felt
then
the
handle
of
the
regulator
is
to
be
drawn
towards
the
operator
by
which
means
the
first
will
be
stopped
so
that
no
more
steam
can
rise
into
the
first
receiver
by
which
means
a
second
receiver
will
be
filled
in
like
manner
whilst
this
is
doing
some
cold
water
must
be
poured
on
the
first
receiver
by
which
means
the
steam
in
it
will
be
cooled
and
thereby
condensed
into
smaller
room
consequently
the
pressure
in
the
valve
or
cock
at
the
bottom
of
the
receiver
there
being
nothing
to
counterbalance
the
atmospheric
pressure
at
the
surface
of
the
receiver
in
the
inner
part
of
the
it
will
be
pressed
up
into
the
receiver
driving
up
before
it
the
valve
at
the
bottom
which
afterwards
falling
again
prevents
the
descent
of
the
water
that
way
then
the
first
receiver
being
at
the
same
time
emptied
of
its
air
push
the
handle
of
the
regulator
and
the
steam
which
rises
from
the
boiler
will
act
upon
the
surface
of
the
water
contained
in
the
first
receiver
where
the
force
or
pressure
on
it
still
increasing
its
elasticity
till
it
exceeds
the
weight
of
a
column
of
water
in
another
then
it
will
necessarily
drive
up
through
the
passage
into
the
and
eventually
discharge
itself
at
the
top
of
the
machinery
after
the
same
manner
though
alternately
is
the
first
receiver
filled
and
emptied
of
water
and
by
this
means
a
regular
stream
kept
continually
running
out
of
the
top
of
a
and
so
the
water
is
raised
very
often
from
the
bottom
of
a
mine
to
the
place
where
it
is
meant
to
be
discharged
it
should
be
added
that
after
the
machine
begins
to
work
and
the
water
has
risen
into
and
filled
the
it
fills
also
a
little
cistern
and
by
that
means
fills
another
pipe
called
the
which
may
be
turned
either
way
over
any
of
the
receivers
when
either
is
thoroughly
heated
by
the
steam
to
condense
it
within
thereby
producing
a
vacuum
which
absorbs
the
water
out
of
the
well
into
the
receiver
on
the
principle
of
a
syphon
also
a
little
above
the
cistern
goes
another
pipe
to
convey
the
water
from
the
into
the
lesser
boiler
for
the
purpose
of
replenishing
the
great
boiler
when
the
water
in
it
begins
to
be
almost
consumed
whenever
there
is
occasion
for
this
the
cock
is
to
be
turned
which
communicates
between
the
and
the
lesser
boiler
to
close
it
effectually
at
the
same
time
having
put
a
little
fire
beneath
the
small
boiler
which
will
grow
hot
its
own
steam
which
has
no
vent
to
escape
pressing
on
its
surface
will
force
the
water
up
another
pipe
through
an
aperture
in
the
great
boiler
and
so
long
will
it
run
till
the
surface
of
the
water
gets
so
low
as
to
be
beneath
the
bottom
of
the
pipe
of
communication
then
the
steam
and
water
running
together
will
cause
the
valve
called
a
clack
to
strike
which
will
intimate
to
the
operator
that
it
has
discharged
itself
into
the
greater
boiler
and
carried
in
as
much
water
as
is
then
necessary
after
which
by
turning
a
cock
as
much
fresh
water
is
let
in
as
may
be
necessary
and
then
by
turning
another
cock
new
fresh
water
is
let
out
of
a
recipient
into
the
less
boiler
as
before
and
thus
the
engine
is
supplied
without
fear
of
decay
or
any
delay
in
the
operations
and
proper
attention
in
the
workmen
is
only
necessary
to
prevent
disorder
in
a
machine
so
expensive
and
complicated
also
to
know
when
the
great
boiler
wants
replenishing
turn
the
if
water
comes
out
it
does
not
need
a
supply
but
if
steam
alone
then
the
want
of
water
is
certain
the
like
with
the
cock
with
which
the
lesser
boiler
is
prepared
for
the
same
purpose
when
the
same
state
will
be
marked
by
like
results
in
working
this
engine
very
little
skill
and
less
labour
is
required
is
the
chief
requisite
it
is
only
to
be
injured
by
want
of
due
care
extreme
stupidity
or
wilful
neglect
the
engine
described
above
does
not
differ
essentially
from
that
first
designed
by
the
inventor
captain
savery
the
chief
alteration
which
now
occurs
is
only
in
some
few
slight
particulars
for
example
the
original
engine
had
only
one
boiler
and
there
was
no
ready
means
for
supplying
it
with
water
to
remedy
the
waste
occasioned
by
evaporation
of
steam
without
stopping
the
action
of
the
engine
whenever
the
boiler
was
emptied
to
such
a
degree
as
to
risk
burning
the
vessel
after
it
was
replenished
the
machine
had
to
remain
idle
till
the
steam
was
raised
thus
causing
an
immense
loss
of
time
which
is
remedied
by
the
application
of
a
second
boiler
the
description
of
the
engine
formerly
mentioned
is
transcribed
from
publication
friend
and
which
had
a
subsidiary
boiler
with
water
of
a
boiling
heat
always
ready
to
supply
the
large
boiler
and
the
power
of
steam
raised
in
it
is
employed
to
force
the
water
into
the
larger
boiler
to
replace
the
waste
occasioned
by
evaporation
from
that
boiler
by
this
means
the
transposition
of
the
feeding
water
is
not
only
speedily
performed
but
being
itself
of
a
boiling
heat
it
is
instantly
ready
to
produce
steam
for
carrying
on
the
work
there
is
also
one
more
grand
improvement
in
the
modern
machine
the
first
engine
was
worked
by
four
separate
cocks
which
the
operator
was
compelled
to
turn
separately
at
every
change
of
stroke
if
he
turned
them
wrong
he
was
not
only
liable
to
damage
the
engine
but
he
prevented
its
effect
and
at
the
same
time
lost
a
part
of
the
operation
whereas
in
the
improved
engine
the
communications
are
made
by
a
double
sliding
valve
or
as
it
has
since
been
termed
regulator
that
is
a
brass
plate
shaped
like
a
fan
and
moving
on
a
centre
within
the
boiler
so
as
to
slide
horizontally
in
contact
with
the
under
surface
of
the
cover
of
the
boiler
to
which
it
is
accurately
fitted
by
grinding
and
thus
at
pleasure
opens
or
shuts
the
orifices
or
entries
to
the
steam
pipes
of
the
two
receivers
alternately
this
regulator
acts
with
less
friction
than
a
cock
of
equal
bore
and
by
the
motion
of
a
single
handle
backwards
at
once
opens
the
proper
steam
pipe
from
one
receiver
and
closes
that
which
belongs
to
the
other
receiver
captain
savery
in
his
publication
before
noticed
describes
the
uses
to
which
this
machine
may
be
applied
besides
those
before
described
to
serve
water
for
turning
all
sorts
of
mills
for
supplying
palaces
noblemen
and
houses
with
water
and
affording
the
means
for
extinguishing
fires
therein
by
the
water
so
raised
the
supplying
cities
and
towns
with
water
draining
fens
and
marshes
for
ships
for
draining
mines
of
water
and
for
preventing
damps
in
mines
desaguliers
we
conceive
ungenerously
attacked
captain
reputation
by
alleging
that
this
was
not
an
original
invention
and
that
he
was
indebted
for
the
first
idea
to
the
previously
mentioned
plan
of
the
marquis
of
worcester
rees
with
a
generous
liberality
worthy
his
great
critical
discrimination
scientific
skill
and
general
erudition
has
we
think
ably
defended
the
character
by
proving
his
ideas
to
have
originated
with
himself
we
have
only
an
opportunity
to
notice
the
most
prominent
features
in
this
justification
where
rees
thus
expresses
himself
know
that
the
marquis
of
worcester
gave
no
hint
concerning
the
or
condensation
of
steam
upon
which
all
the
merit
of
the
modern
engine
the
marquis
of
engine
was
actuated
wholly
by
the
elastic
power
of
steam
which
he
either
found
out
or
proved
by
the
bursting
of
cannon
in
part
filled
with
water
and
not
the
least
hint
that
steam
so
expanded
is
capable
of
being
so
far
contracted
in
an
instant
as
to
leave
the
space
it
occupied
in
a
vessel
and
occasion
in
a
great
measure
a
subsequent
to
the
marquis
of
and
captain
original
ideas
and
also
subsequent
to
the
perfection
the
captain
had
brought
his
machine
to
amonton
a
native
of
france
invented
a
machine
which
he
called
a
but
it
does
not
appear
that
it
was
ever
brought
to
that
perfection
to
be
conducive
to
real
utility
although
it
was
certainly
very
ingenious
also
papin
a
native
of
germany
made
some
pretensions
to
what
he
alleged
was
an
invention
of
his
own
only
it
happened
to
appear
unfortunately
for
his
claim
that
he
was
in
london
and
present
at
the
time
when
captain
savery
exhibited
the
model
of
his
to
the
royal
society
he
made
some
unsuccessful
experiments
by
order
of
his
patron
the
landgrave
of
hesse
which
sufficiently
proved
that
if
he
was
the
inventor
he
did
not
understand
the
nature
of
his
own
machine
not
long
after
savery
had
invented
his
engine
thomas
newcomen
an
ironmonger
and
john
calley
a
glazier
began
to
direct
their
attention
to
the
employment
of
steam
as
a
mechanic
power
their
first
engine
was
constructed
about
the
year
this
machine
still
acted
on
the
principle
of
condensing
the
steam
by
means
of
cold
water
and
the
pressure
of
the
atmosphere
on
the
piston
it
was
found
of
great
value
in
pumping
water
from
deep
mines
but
the
mode
of
its
construction
the
great
waste
of
fuel
the
continued
cooling
and
heating
of
the
cylinder
and
the
limited
capacities
of
the
atmosphere
in
impelling
the
piston
downward
all
tended
to
circumscribe
its
utility
the
was
in
this
state
when
it
happily
attracted
the
attention
of
watt
to
whom
the
merit
and
honour
is
due
of
having
first
rendered
this
invention
available
as
a
mechanical
agent
we
can
not
illustrate
the
improvements
of
this
ingenious
individual
better
than
by
giving
a
short
biographical
sketch
of
him
to
whom
the
world
is
so
much
indebted
james
watt
was
born
at
greenock
an
extensive
seaport
in
the
west
of
scotland
on
the
of
january
his
father
was
a
merchant
and
also
one
of
the
magistrates
of
that
town
he
received
the
rudiments
of
his
education
in
his
native
place
but
his
health
being
then
extremely
delicate
as
it
continued
to
be
to
the
end
of
his
life
his
attendance
at
school
was
not
always
very
regular
he
amply
made
up
however
for
what
he
lost
in
this
way
by
the
diligence
with
which
he
pursued
his
studies
at
home
where
without
any
assistance
he
succeeded
at
a
very
early
age
in
making
considerable
proficiency
in
various
branches
of
knowledge
even
at
this
time
it
is
said
his
favourite
study
was
mechanical
science
to
a
love
of
which
he
was
probably
in
some
degree
led
by
the
example
of
his
grandfather
and
his
uncle
both
of
whom
had
been
teachers
of
mathematics
and
had
left
a
considerable
reputation
for
learning
and
ability
in
that
department
young
watt
however
was
not
indebted
to
any
instruction
of
theirs
for
his
own
acquirements
in
science
the
former
having
died
two
years
before
and
the
latter
one
year
after
he
was
born
at
the
age
of
eighteen
he
was
sent
to
london
to
be
apprenticed
to
a
maker
of
mathematical
instruments
but
in
little
more
than
a
year
the
state
of
his
health
forced
him
to
return
to
scotland
and
he
never
received
any
further
instruction
in
his
profession
a
year
or
two
after
this
however
a
visit
which
he
paid
to
some
relations
in
glasgow
suggested
to
him
the
plan
of
attempting
to
establish
himself
in
that
city
in
the
line
for
which
he
had
been
educated
in
he
accordingly
removed
thither
and
was
immediately
appointed
mathematical
instrument
maker
to
the
college
in
this
situation
he
remained
for
some
years
during
which
notwithstanding
almost
constant
ill
health
he
continued
both
to
prosecute
his
profession
and
to
labour
in
the
general
cultivation
of
his
mind
with
extraordinary
ardour
and
perseverance
here
also
he
enjoyed
the
intimacy
and
friendship
of
several
distinguished
persons
who
were
then
members
of
the
university
especially
of
the
celebrated
black
the
discoverer
of
the
principle
of
latent
heat
and
robison
so
well
known
by
his
treatises
on
mechanical
science
who
was
then
a
student
and
about
the
same
age
as
himself
honourable
however
as
his
present
appointment
was
and
important
as
were
many
of
the
advantages
to
which
it
introduced
him
he
probably
did
not
find
it
a
very
lucrative
one
and
therefore
in
when
about
to
marry
he
removed
from
his
apartments
in
the
university
to
a
house
in
the
city
and
entered
upon
the
profession
of
a
general
engineer
for
this
his
genius
and
scientific
attainments
most
admirably
qualified
him
accordingly
he
soon
acquired
a
high
reputation
and
was
extensively
employed
in
making
surveys
and
estimates
for
canals
harbours
bridges
and
other
public
works
his
advice
and
assistance
were
sought
for
in
almost
all
the
important
improvements
of
this
description
which
were
now
undertaken
or
proposed
in
his
native
country
but
another
pursuit
in
which
he
had
been
for
some
time
privately
engaged
was
destined
ere
long
to
withdraw
him
from
this
line
of
exertion
and
to
occupy
his
whole
mind
with
an
object
still
more
worthy
of
its
extraordinary
powers
while
yet
residing
in
the
college
his
attention
had
been
directed
to
the
employment
of
steam
as
a
mechanical
agent
by
some
speculations
of
his
friend
robison
with
regard
to
the
practicability
of
applying
it
to
the
movement
of
and
he
had
also
himself
made
some
experiments
with
digester
with
the
view
of
ascertaining
its
expansive
force
he
had
not
prosecuted
the
inquiry
however
so
far
as
to
have
arrived
at
any
determinate
result
when
the
winter
of
a
small
model
of
engine
was
sent
him
by
the
professor
of
natural
philosophy
to
be
repaired
and
fitted
for
exhibition
in
the
class
the
examination
of
this
model
set
watt
upon
thinking
anew
and
with
more
interest
than
ever
on
the
powers
of
steam
struck
with
the
radical
imperfections
of
the
atmospheric
engine
he
began
to
turn
in
his
mind
the
possibility
of
employing
steam
in
mechanics
in
some
new
manner
which
should
enable
it
to
work
with
much
more
powerful
effect
this
idea
having
got
possession
of
him
he
engaged
in
an
extensive
course
of
experiments
for
the
purpose
of
ascertaining
as
many
facts
as
possible
with
regard
to
the
properties
of
steam
and
the
pains
he
took
in
this
investigation
were
rewarded
with
several
valuable
discoveries
the
rapidity
with
which
water
evaporates
he
found
for
instance
depended
simply
upon
the
quantity
of
heat
which
was
made
to
enter
it
and
this
again
on
the
extent
of
the
surface
exposed
to
the
fire
he
also
ascertained
the
quantity
of
coals
necessary
for
the
evaporation
of
any
given
quantity
of
water
the
heat
at
which
water
boils
under
various
pressures
and
many
other
particulars
of
a
similar
kind
which
had
never
before
been
accurately
determined
thus
prepared
by
a
complete
knowledge
of
the
properties
of
the
agent
with
which
he
had
to
work
he
next
took
into
consideration
with
a
view
to
their
amendment
what
he
deemed
the
two
great
defects
of
engine
the
first
of
these
was
the
necessity
arising
from
the
method
employed
to
concentrate
the
steam
of
cooling
the
cylinder
before
every
stroke
of
the
piston
by
the
water
injected
into
it
on
this
account
a
much
more
powerful
application
of
heat
than
would
otherwise
have
been
requisite
was
demanded
for
the
purpose
of
again
heating
that
vessel
when
it
was
to
be
refilled
with
steam
in
fact
watt
ascertained
that
there
was
thus
occasioned
in
the
feeding
of
the
machine
a
waste
of
not
less
than
of
the
whole
fuel
employed
if
the
cylinder
instead
of
being
thus
cooled
for
every
stroke
of
the
piston
could
be
permanently
hot
a
fourth
part
of
the
heat
which
had
hitherto
been
applied
would
be
found
sufficient
to
produce
steam
enough
to
fill
it
how
then
was
this
desideratum
to
be
obtained
savery
the
first
who
really
constructed
a
working
engine
and
whose
arrangements
as
we
have
already
remarked
all
showed
a
very
superior
ingenuity
employed
the
method
of
throwing
cold
water
over
the
outside
of
the
vessel
containing
the
steam
a
perfectly
manageable
process
but
at
the
same
time
a
very
wasteful
one
inasmuch
as
every
time
it
was
repeated
it
cooled
not
only
the
steam
but
the
vessel
also
which
therefore
had
again
to
be
heated
by
a
large
expenditure
of
fuel
before
the
steam
could
be
produced
method
of
injecting
the
water
into
the
cylinder
was
a
considerable
improvement
on
this
but
it
was
still
objectionable
on
the
same
ground
though
not
to
the
same
degree
it
still
cooled
not
only
the
steam
on
which
it
was
desired
to
produce
that
effect
but
also
the
cylinder
itself
which
as
the
vessel
in
which
more
steam
was
to
be
immediately
manufactured
it
was
so
important
to
keep
hot
it
was
also
a
very
serious
objection
to
this
last
mentioned
plan
that
the
injected
water
itself
from
the
heat
of
the
place
into
which
it
was
thrown
was
very
apt
to
be
partly
converted
into
steam
and
the
more
cold
water
was
used
the
more
considerable
did
this
creation
of
new
steam
become
in
fact
in
the
last
of
engines
the
rarefaction
of
the
vacuum
was
so
greatly
improved
from
this
cause
that
the
resistance
experienced
by
the
piston
in
its
descent
was
found
to
amount
to
about
a
fourth
part
of
the
whole
atmospheric
pressure
by
which
it
was
carried
down
or
in
other
words
the
working
power
of
the
machine
was
thereby
diminished
after
reflecting
for
some
time
upon
all
this
it
at
last
occurred
to
watt
to
consider
whether
it
might
not
be
possible
instead
of
continuing
to
condense
the
steam
in
the
cylinder
to
contrive
that
method
of
drawing
it
off
to
undergo
that
operation
in
some
other
vessel
this
fortunate
idea
having
presented
itself
to
his
mind
it
was
not
long
before
his
ingenuity
suggested
to
him
the
means
of
realising
it
in
the
course
of
one
or
two
days
according
to
his
own
account
he
had
all
the
necessary
apparatus
arranged
in
his
mind
the
plan
which
he
devised
was
indeed
an
extremely
simple
one
and
on
that
account
the
more
beautiful
he
proposed
to
establish
a
communication
by
an
open
pipe
between
the
cylinder
and
another
vessel
the
consequence
of
which
evidently
would
be
that
when
the
steam
was
admitted
into
the
former
it
would
flow
into
the
other
to
fill
it
also
if
then
the
portion
in
this
latter
vessel
only
should
be
subjected
to
a
condensing
process
by
being
brought
into
contact
with
cold
water
or
any
other
convenient
means
what
would
follow
why
a
vacuum
would
be
produced
here
into
that
as
a
vent
more
steam
would
immediately
rush
from
the
cylinder
that
likewise
would
be
condensed
and
so
the
process
would
go
on
till
all
the
steam
had
left
the
cylinder
and
a
perfect
vacuum
had
been
effected
in
that
vessel
without
so
much
as
a
drop
of
cold
water
having
touched
or
entered
it
the
separate
vessel
alone
or
the
condenser
as
watt
called
it
would
be
cooled
by
the
water
used
to
condense
the
steam
and
that
instead
of
being
an
evil
manifestly
tended
to
promote
and
quicken
the
condensation
when
watt
reduced
his
views
to
the
test
of
experiment
he
found
the
result
to
answer
his
most
sanguine
expectations
the
cylinder
although
emptied
of
its
steam
for
every
stroke
of
the
piston
as
before
was
now
constantly
kept
at
the
same
temperature
with
the
steam
or
deg
fahrenheit
and
the
consequence
was
that
of
the
fuel
formerly
required
sufficed
to
feed
the
engine
but
besides
this
most
important
saving
in
the
expense
of
maintaining
the
engine
its
power
was
greatly
increased
by
the
most
perfect
vacuum
produced
in
the
new
construction
in
which
the
condensing
water
being
no
longer
admitted
within
the
cylinder
could
not
as
before
create
new
steam
there
while
displacing
the
old
such
then
was
the
remedy
by
which
the
genius
of
this
great
inventor
effectually
cured
the
first
and
most
serious
defect
of
the
old
apparatus
in
carrying
his
ideas
into
execution
he
encountered
as
was
to
be
expected
many
difficulties
arising
principally
from
the
impossibility
of
realising
theoretical
perfection
of
structure
with
such
materials
as
human
art
is
obliged
to
work
with
but
his
ingenuity
and
perseverance
overcame
every
obstacle
one
of
the
things
which
cost
him
the
greatest
trouble
was
how
to
fit
the
piston
so
exactly
to
the
cylinder
as
without
affecting
the
freedom
of
its
motion
to
prevent
the
passage
of
the
air
between
the
two
in
the
old
engine
this
end
had
been
obtained
by
covering
the
piston
with
a
small
quantity
of
water
the
dripping
down
of
which
into
the
space
below
where
it
merely
mixed
with
the
stream
introduced
to
effect
the
condensation
was
of
little
or
no
consequence
but
in
the
new
construction
the
superiority
of
which
consisted
in
keeping
this
receptacle
for
the
steam
always
both
hot
and
dry
such
an
effusion
of
moisture
although
in
very
small
quantities
would
have
occasioned
material
inconvenience
the
air
alone
besides
which
in
the
old
engine
followed
the
piston
in
its
descent
acted
with
considerable
effect
in
cooling
the
lower
part
of
the
cylinder
his
attempts
to
overcome
this
difficulty
while
they
succeeded
in
that
object
conducted
watt
also
to
another
improvement
which
effected
the
complete
removal
of
what
we
have
called
the
second
radical
imperfection
of
engine
namely
its
for
a
moving
power
of
the
expansive
force
of
steam
the
effectual
way
it
occurred
to
him
of
preventing
any
air
from
escaping
into
the
part
of
the
cylinder
below
the
piston
would
be
to
dispense
with
the
use
of
that
element
above
the
piston
and
to
substitute
there
likewise
the
same
contrivance
as
below
of
alternate
steam
and
a
vacuum
this
was
of
course
to
be
accomplished
by
merely
opening
communications
from
the
upper
part
of
the
cylinder
to
the
boiler
on
the
one
hand
and
the
condenser
on
the
other
and
forming
it
at
the
same
time
into
an
chamber
by
means
of
a
cover
with
only
a
hole
in
it
to
admit
the
rod
or
shank
of
the
piston
which
might
besides
without
impeding
its
freedom
of
action
be
padded
with
hemp
the
more
completely
to
exclude
the
air
it
was
so
contrived
accordingly
by
a
proper
arrangement
of
the
cocks
and
the
machinery
connected
with
them
that
while
there
was
a
vacuum
in
one
end
of
the
cylinder
there
should
be
an
admission
of
steam
into
the
other
and
the
steam
so
admitted
now
served
not
only
by
its
susceptibility
of
sudden
condensation
to
create
the
vacuum
but
also
by
its
expansive
force
to
impel
the
piston
these
were
the
great
improvements
which
watt
introduced
in
what
may
be
called
the
principle
of
the
or
in
other
words
in
the
manner
of
using
and
applying
the
steam
they
constitute
therefore
the
grounds
of
his
claim
to
be
regarded
as
the
true
author
of
the
conquest
that
has
been
obtained
by
man
over
this
powerful
element
but
original
and
comprehensive
as
were
the
views
out
of
which
these
fundamental
inventions
arose
the
exquisite
and
inexhaustible
ingenuity
which
the
engine
as
finally
perfected
by
him
displays
in
every
part
of
its
subordinate
mechanism
is
calculated
to
strike
us
perhaps
with
scarcely
less
admiration
it
forms
undoubtedly
the
best
exemplification
that
has
ever
been
afforded
of
the
number
and
diversity
of
services
which
a
piece
of
machinery
may
be
made
to
render
to
itself
by
means
solely
of
the
various
application
of
its
first
moving
power
when
that
has
once
been
called
into
action
of
these
contrivances
however
we
can
only
notice
one
or
two
by
way
of
specimen
perhaps
the
most
singular
is
that
called
the
this
consists
of
an
upright
spindle
which
is
kept
constantly
turning
by
being
connected
with
a
certain
part
of
the
machinery
and
from
which
two
balls
are
suspended
in
opposite
directions
by
rods
attached
by
joints
somewhat
in
the
manner
of
the
legs
of
a
pair
of
tongs
as
long
as
the
motion
of
the
engine
is
uniform
that
of
the
spindle
is
so
likewise
and
the
balls
continue
steadily
revolving
at
the
same
distance
from
each
other
but
as
soon
as
any
alteration
in
the
action
of
the
piston
takes
place
the
balls
if
it
has
become
more
rapid
fly
further
apart
under
the
influence
of
the
increased
centrifugal
force
which
actuates
them
or
approach
nearer
to
each
other
in
the
opposite
circumstances
this
alone
would
have
served
to
indicate
the
state
of
matters
to
the
eye
but
watt
was
not
to
be
so
satisfied
he
connected
the
rods
with
a
valve
in
the
tube
by
which
the
steam
is
admitted
to
the
cylinder
from
the
boiler
in
such
a
way
that
as
they
retreat
from
each
other
they
gradually
narrow
the
opening
which
is
so
guarded
or
enlarge
it
as
they
tend
to
collapse
thus
diminishing
the
supply
of
steam
when
the
engine
is
going
too
fast
and
when
it
is
not
going
fast
enough
enabling
it
to
regain
its
proper
speed
by
allowing
it
an
increase
of
aliment
again
the
constant
supply
of
a
sufficiency
of
water
to
the
boiler
is
secured
by
an
equally
simple
provision
namely
by
a
resting
on
the
surface
of
the
water
which
as
soon
as
it
is
carried
down
by
the
consumption
of
the
water
to
a
certain
point
opens
a
valve
and
admits
more
and
so
on
through
all
the
different
parts
of
the
apparatus
the
various
wonders
of
which
can
not
be
better
summed
up
than
in
the
forcible
and
graphic
language
of
a
recent
writer
the
present
perfect
state
of
the
engine
it
appears
a
thing
almost
endowed
with
intelligence
it
regulates
with
perfect
accuracy
and
uniformity
the
of
its
in
a
given
time
or
them
moreover
to
tell
how
much
work
it
has
done

the
beats
of

not

itself

by
ringing
a
bell

with
all
these
talents
and
qualities

it
is
the

and
a
permanent
realisation
of
the
of
eastern
fable
whose
supernatural
powers
were
occasionally
at
the
command
of
in
addition
to
those
difficulties
which
his
unrivalled
mechanical
ingenuity
enabled
him
to
surmount
watt
notwithstanding
the
merit
of
his
inventions
had
to
contend
for
some
time
with
others
of
a
different
nature
in
his
attempts
to
reduce
them
to
practice
he
had
no
pecuniary
resources
of
his
own
and
was
at
first
without
any
friend
willing
to
run
the
risk
of
the
outlay
necessary
for
an
experiment
on
a
sufficiently
large
scale
at
last
he
applied
to
roebuck
an
ingenious
and
spirited
speculator
who
had
just
established
the
carron
not
far
from
glasgow
and
held
also
at
the
same
time
a
lease
of
the
extensive
at
kinneal
the
property
of
the
duke
of
hamilton
roebuck
agreed
to
advance
the
requisite
funds
on
having
of
the
profits
made
over
to
him
and
upon
this
watt
took
out
his
first
patent
in
the
beginning
of
the
year
an
engine
with
a
cylinder
of
eighteen
inches
diameter
was
soon
after
erected
at
kinneal
and
although
as
a
first
experiment
it
was
necessarily
in
some
respects
of
defective
construction
its
working
completely
demonstrated
the
value
of
improvements
but
roebuck
whose
undertakings
were
very
numerous
and
various
in
no
long
time
after
forming
this
connexion
found
himself
involved
in
such
pecuniary
difficulties
as
to
put
it
out
of
his
power
to
make
any
further
advances
in
prosecution
of
its
object
on
this
watt
applied
himself
for
some
years
almost
entirely
to
the
ordinary
work
of
his
profession
as
a
civil
engineer
but
at
last
about
the
year
when
all
hopes
of
any
farther
assistance
from
roebuck
were
at
an
end
he
resolved
to
close
with
a
proposal
which
had
been
made
to
him
through
his
friend
small
of
birmingham
that
he
should
remove
to
that
town
and
enter
into
partnership
with
the
eminent
hardware
manufacturer
boulton
whose
extensive
establishments
at
soho
had
already
become
famous
over
europe
and
procured
for
england
an
unrivalled
reputation
for
the
arts
there
carried
on
accordingly
an
arrangement
having
been
made
with
roebuck
by
which
his
share
of
the
patent
was
transferred
to
boulton
the
firm
of
boulton
and
watt
commenced
the
business
of
making
in
the
year
watt
now
obtained
from
parliament
an
extension
of
his
patent
for
years
in
consideration
of
the
acknowledged
national
importance
of
his
inventions
the
first
thing
which
he
and
his
partner
did
was
to
erect
an
engine
at
soho
which
they
invited
all
persons
interested
in
such
machines
to
inspect
they
then
proposed
to
erect
similar
machines
wherever
required
on
the
very
liberal
principle
of
receiving
as
payment
for
each
only
of
the
saving
in
fuel
which
it
should
effect
as
compared
with
one
of
the
old
construction
but
the
draining
of
mines
was
only
one
of
the
many
applications
of
the
now
at
his
command
which
watt
contemplated
and
in
course
of
time
accomplished
during
the
whole
years
indeed
over
which
his
renewed
patent
extended
the
perfecting
of
his
invention
was
his
chief
occupation
and
notwithstanding
a
delicate
state
of
health
and
the
depressing
affliction
of
severe
headaches
to
which
he
was
extremely
subject
he
continued
throughout
this
period
to
persevere
with
unwearied
diligence
in
adding
new
improvements
to
the
mechanism
of
the
engine
and
devising
the
means
of
applying
it
to
new
purposes
of
usefulness
he
devoted
in
particular
the
exertions
of
many
years
to
the
contriving
of
the
best
methods
of
making
the
action
of
the
piston
communicate
a
rotary
motion
in
various
circumstances
and
between
the
years
and
he
took
out
four
different
patents
for
inventions
having
this
in
his
view
it
is
gratifying
to
reflect
that
even
while
he
was
yet
alive
watt
received
from
the
most
illustrious
contemporaries
the
honours
due
to
his
genius
in
he
was
elected
a
fellow
of
the
royal
society
the
degree
of
doctor
of
laws
was
conferred
upon
him
by
the
university
of
glasgow
in
and
in
he
was
elected
a
member
of
the
french
institute
he
died
on
the
of
august
in
the
year
of
his
age
the
beneficial
results
arising
from
the
ingenuity
of
watt
have
been
surprising
the
has
already
gone
far
to
revolutionise
the
whole
domain
of
human
industry
and
almost
every
year
is
adding
to
its
power
and
its
conquests
in
our
manufactures
our
arts
our
commerce
our
social
accommodations
it
is
constantly
achieving
what
little
more
than
half
a
century
ago
would
have
been
accounted
miraculous
and
impossible
trunk
of
an
elephant
it

been

truly
said

pick
up
a

rend
an

as
nothing
to

it

engrave
a

crush

of
obdurate
metal
like
wax
before
it
draw
out
without
breaking
a
thread
as
fine
as
gossamer

lift
a

of

like
a

embroider
muslins

forge
anchors
cut
steel
into
ribbands
and
impel
loaded
vessels
against
the
fury
of
the
winds
and
another
application
of
it
is
perhaps
destined
to
be
productive
of
still
greater
changes
on
the
condition
of
society
than
have
resulted
from
many
of
its
previous
achievements
we
refer
to
railroads
the
first
great
experiment
was
the
liverpool
and
manchester
railway
which
was
opened
we
believe
in
and
practically
demonstrated
with
what
hitherto
almost
undreamt
of
rapidity
travelling
by
land
may
be
carried
on
through
the
aid
of
steam
carriages
under
the
impetus
communicated
by
this
the
most
potent
and
at
the
same
time
the
most
perfectly
controllable
of
all
our
mechanical
agencies
can
be
drawn
forward
at
the
flying
speed
of
thirty
and
miles
an
hour
when
so
much
has
been
already
done
it
would
be
rash
to
conclude
that
even
this
is
to
be
our
ultimate
limit
of
attainment
in
navigation
the
resistance
of
the
water
which
increases
rapidly
as
the
force
opposed
to
it
increases
very
soon
set
bounds
to
the
rate
at
which
even
the
power
of
steam
can
impel
a
vessel
forward
but
on
land
the
thin
medium
of
the
air
presents
no
such
insurmountable
obstacles
to
a
force
making
its
way
through
it
and
a
rapidity
of
movement
may
perhaps
be
eventually
attained
here
which
is
to
us
even
as
yet
inconceivable
but
even
when
the
rate
of
land
travelling
already
shown
to
be
quite
practicable
shall
have
become
universal
in
what
a
new
state
of
society
shall
we
find
ourselves
a
nation
will
then
indeed
become
a
community
and
all
the
benefits
of
the
highest
civilization
will
be
diffused
equally
over
the
land
like
the
light
of
heaven
this
invention
in
short
when
fully
consummated
will
confer
upon
man
as
much
new
power
and
enjoyment
as
if
he
were
actually
endowed
with
wings
the
commerce
of
the
kingdom
has
also
greatly
benefited
by
the
introduction
of
this
valuable
auxiliary
as
will
be
seen
from
the
following
extract
from
the
companion
establishment
of
between
england
and
ireland
has
greatly
contributed
to
the
prosperity
of
both
countries
how
have
steam
boats
done
this
they
have
greatly
increased
the
trade
of
both
countries
on
the
examination
of
williams
before
a
committee
of
the
house
of
commons
he
stated
that
were
established
there
was
little
trade
in
the
smaller
articles
of
farming
production
such
as
poultry
and
eggs
the
first
trading
from
liverpool
to
dublin
was
set
up
in
there
are
now
forty
such
boats
between
england
and
ireland
the
sailing
vessels
were
from
one
week
to
two
or
three
weeks
on
the
passage
the
voyage
from
liverpool
to
dublin
is
now
performed
in
fourteen
hours
reckoning
ten
mile
for
an
hour
dublin
and
liverpool
are
one
hundred
and
forty
miles
apart
with
the
old
vessels
taking
twelve
days
as
the
average
time
of
the
voyage
they
were
separated
as
completely
as
they
would
be
by
a
distance
of
two
thousand
eight
hundred
and
eighty
miles
what
is
the
consequence
traders
may
now
have
from
any
of
the
manufacturing
towns
in
england
within
two
or
three
days
even
the
smallest
quantity
of
any
description
of
goods
and
thus
of
the
effects
has
been
to
give
a
productive
employment
of
the
capital
of
persons
in
secondary
lines
of
business
that
formerly
could
not
have
been
brought
into
williams
adds
am
a
daily
witness
to
the
intercourse
by
means
of
the
small
traders
themselves
between
england
and
ireland
those
persons
find
their
way
into
the
interior
of
england
and
purchase
manufactured
goods
themselves
they
are
of
course
enabled
to
sell
them
upon
much
better
terms
in
ireland
and
i
anticipate
that
this
will
shortly
lead
to
the
creation
of
shops
and
other
establishments
in
the
interior
of
ireland
for
the
sale
of
a
great
variety
of
articles
which
are
not
now
to
be
had
how
do
the
small
dealers
in
english
manufactured
goods
find
purchasers
in
the
rude
districts
of
ireland
for
our
cloths
and
our
hardware
because
the
little
farmers
have
sent
us
their
butter
and
eggs
and
poultry
and
have
either
taken
our
manufactures
in
exchange
or
have
taken
back
our
money
to
purchase
our
manufactures
which
is
the
same
thing
many
millions
of
eggs
collected
amongst
the
very
poorest
classes
by
the
industry
of
the
women
and
children
are
annually
sent
from
dublin
to
liverpool
williams
has
known
fifty
tons
or
eight
hundred
and
eighty
thousand
eggs
shipped
in
one
day
as
well
as
ten
tons
of
poultry
and
he
says
this
is
quite
a
new
creation
of
property
it
is
a
creation
of
property
that
has
a
direct
tendency
to
act
upon
the
condition
of
the
poorest
classes
in
ireland
for
the
produce
is
laid
out
in
providing
clothes
for
the
females
and
children
of
the
families
who
engage
in
rearing
poultry
and
collecting
eggs
thus
the
english
manufacturer
is
bettered
for
he
has
a
new
market
for
his
manufactures
which
he
exchanges
for
cheap
provisions
and
the
dealer
in
eggs
and
poultry
has
a
new
impulse
to
this
branch
of
industry
because
it
enables
him
to
give
clothes
to
his
wife
and
children
this
exchange
of
benefits
this
advancement
in
the
condition
of
both
parties
this
creation
of
produce
and
of
profitable
labour
this
increase
of
the
number
of
labourers
could
not
have
taken
place
without
machinery
that
machinery
is
the
carriage
which
conveys
the
produce
to
the
river
and
the
which
makes
a
port
in
another
country
much
nearer
for
practical
purposes
than
the
market
town
of
a
thinly
peopled
district
a
new
machinery
is
added
the
running
on
the
railroad
as
one
of
the
witnesses
truly
says
like
carrying
liverpool
forty
miles
into
the
interior
and
thus
extending
the
circle
to
which
the
supply
will
be
the
last
invention
perfects
all
the
inventions
which
have
preceded
it
the
village
and
the
city
are
brought
close
together
in
effort
and
yet
retain
all
the
advantages
of
their
local
situation
the
port
and
the
manufactory
are
divided
only
by
two
hours
distance
in
time
while
their
distance
in
space
affords
room
for
all
the
various
occupations
which
contribute
to
the
perfection
of
either
the
whole
territory
of
great
britain
and
ireland
is
more
compact
more
closely
united
more
accessible
than
was
a
single
county
two
centuries
the
communication
between
england
and
ireland
has
greatly
increased
since
the
above
remarks
were
written
in
there
are
now
upwards
of
four
hundred
sailing
between
ireland
and
great
britain
and
of
late
years
the
largest
export
from
that
unfortunate
country
consists
of
her
starving
population
who
true
enough
find
their
way
into
the
interior
of
england
but
not
with
the
intention
of
purchasing
manufactured
goods
but
of
being
employed
in
the
manufacturing
of
them
we
believe
that
our
mechanical
readers
at
least
will
agree
with
us
when
we
say
that
the
benefit
has
not
been
reciprocal
england
for
her
share
has
been
burthened
with
a
pauper
population
and
her
sons
deprived
of
their
employment
by
the
immense
immigration
that
has
of
late
years
taken
place
poor
rates
are
multiplied
to
an
extent
hitherto
unheard
of
and
our
streets
swarming
with
beggars
and
those
of
the
most
importunate
class
so
much
was
this
the
case
that
in
and
liverpool
was
inundated
with
paupers
from
the
sister
country
to
such
a
degree
that
her
authorities
were
compelled
to
petition
government
to
put
an
end
to
the
nuisance
and
to
grant
them
assistance
to
prevent
the
death
of
so
many
thousands
of
their
from
dying
for
want
the
were
so
increased
that
the
ratepayers
with
justice
complained
and
we
question
much
if
ever
the
english
manufactures
have
been
so
much
benefited
by
the
commerce
as
the
foregoing
quotation
would
lead
us
to
believe
that
we
have
been
supplied
with
enormous
quantities
of
provisions
we
can
not
deny
but
that
the
payment
of
these
was
taken
back
in
our
cloths
and
our
hardware
is
very
questionable
that
the
money
was
taken
back
there
can
be
little
doubt
not
for
the
purpose
however
of
buying
clothes
for
the
wives
and
children
of
those
families
whose
industry
had
supplied
us
with
eggs
and
poultry
but
for
supplying
the
insatiate
wants
of
their
profligate
landlords
who
were
squandering
the
subsistence
of
the
needy
peasantry
in
another
land
if
any
class
of
men
have
obtained
benefit
by
means
of
this
increased
and
speedy
communication
between
the
two
countries
it
assuredly
is
the
absentee
irish
landlord
mills
corn
mills
are
of
very
ancient
origin
and
it
may
not
be
uninteresting
to
our
readers
to
learn
something
of
the
customs
of
our
forefathers
with
regard
to
them
to
which
we
will
subjoin
such
modern
improvements
as
the
more
advanced
state
of
the
arts
have
enabled
the
moderns
to
achieve
and
to
excel
the
imperfect
information
of
the
ancients
in
mechanical
sciences
in
support
of
the
antiquity
of
grinding
corn
we
may
go
as
for
back
as
the
days
of
the
patriarch
abraham
who
we
are
informed
in
genesis
xviii
into
the
tent
unto
sarah
and
said
make
ready
quickly
three
measures
of
fine
meal
knead
it
and
make
cakes
upon
the
to
this
we
may
add
that
it
appears
in
a
subsequent
text
numbers
xi
that
manna
was
ground
like
corn
the
earliest
instrument
for
this
purpose
seems
to
have
been
the
mortar
which
was
retained
long
after
the
introduction
of
mills
properly
so
called
because
they
were
most
probably
at
first
very
imperfect
in
process
of
time
the
mortar
was
made
ridged
and
the
pestle
notched
at
the
bottom
by
which
means
the
grain
was
rather
grated
than
pounded
a
passage
in
pliny
which
has
not
as
yet
had
a
satisfactory
interpretation
renders
this
conjecture
probable
in
time
a
handle
was
added
to
the
top
of
the
pestle
that
it
might
be
more
easily
driven
round
in
a
circle
whence
this
machine
at
first
was
called
by
this
means
assuming
the
name
of
a
such
a
mill
was
so
called
from
rubbing
backwards
and
forwards
and
varied
but
little
from
those
used
by
our
apothecaries
potters
and
other
artisans
from
expressions
in
the
sacred
volume
we
may
rationally
infer
that
it
was
customary
to
have
a
mill
of
this
sort
in
every
family
moses
having
forbidden
to
take
such
instruments
for
a
pledge
for
that
says
he
man
shall
take
the
nether
or
the
upper
millstone
to
pledge
for
he
taketh
a
it
is
observed
by
michaelis
on
this
passage
that
a
man
could
not
then
grind
consequently
could
not
bake
the
necessary
daily
bread
for
the
family
grinding
was
then
the
employment
of
the
women
particularly
of
female
slaves
as
at
present
in
those
countries
which
are
uncivilised
the
portion
of
strength
required
for
the
operation
therefore
could
not
have
been
great
but
afterwards
the
mills
were
driven
by
bondsmen
whose
necks
were
placed
in
a
circular
machine
of
wood
so
that
they
could
not
put
their
hands
to
their
mouths
or
eat
of
the
meal
this
must
have
been
an
interesting
link
between
the
hand
and
the
in
course
of
time
shafts
were
added
to
the
mill
that
it
might
be
driven
by
cattle
which
were
then
blindfolded
the
first
cattle
mills
were
called
which
had
probably
only
a
heavy
pestle
like
the
but
it
is
conjectured
that
it
must
have
been
soon
remarked
that
the
labour
would
be
more
easily
accomplished
if
instead
of
the
pestle
a
large
heavy
cylinder
was
employed
a
competent
judge
has
however
believed
that
the
first
cattle
mills
had
not
a
spout
or
trough
as
ours
have
at
least
those
tournefort
saw
at
nicaria
consisted
only
of
two
stones
but
the
meal
issued
through
an
opening
in
the
upper
one
and
fell
upon
a
board
or
table
on
which
the
lower
one
rested
the
upper
millstone
they
called
or
and
the
lower
one
the
name
of
the
first
also
signified
a
cone
with
a
blunt
apex
whence
it
has
been
thought
by
some
that
corn
was
first
rubbed
into
meal
by
rolling
one
stone
upon
another
as
painters
now
grind
colours
with
a
muller
this
is
not
improbable
as
present
practice
among
barbarous
people
fully
proves
it
is
also
apparent
that
the
upper
millstone
was
substituted
for
the
pestle
which
action
may
have
lent
it
a
name
when
they
called
it
professor
beckmann
has
followed
gori
in
his
description
of
an
antique
gem
engraved
on
red
jasper
upon
which
appears
naked
figure
of
a
man
who
in
his
left
hand
holds
a
sheaf
of
corn
and
in
the
right
a
machine
that
in
all
probability
is
a
gori
considers
the
figure
as
a
representation
of
the
god
eunostus
who
was
the
god
of
mills
the
machine
which
eunostus
seems
to
exhibit
or
to
be
surveying
himself
is
as
far
as
one
can
distinguish
for
the
stone
is
scarcely
half
an
inch
in
size
shaped
like
a
chest
narrow
at
the
top
and
wide
at
the
bottom
it
stands
upon
a
table
and
in
the
bottom
there
is
a
perpendicular
pipe
from
which
the
meal
also
represented
by
the
artist
appears
to
be
issuing
above
the
chest
or
body
of
the
mill
has
either
a
top
with
an
aperture
or
perhaps
a
basket
sunk
into
it
from
which
the
corn
falls
into
the
mill
on
one
side
nearly
about
the
middle
of
it
there
projects
a
broken
shank
which
without
overstraining
the
imagination
may
be
considered
as
a
handle
or
that
part
of
the
mill
which
some
call
though
this
figure
is
small
and
though
it
gives
very
little
idea
of
the
internal
construction
one
may
however
conclude
from
it
that
the
roller
whether
it
was
of
wood
or
of
iron
smooth
or
notched
did
not
stand
perpendicularly
like
those
of
our
coffee
mills
but
lay
horizontally
which
gives
us
reason
to
conjecture
a
construction
more
ingenious
than
that
of
the
first
invention
the
axis
of
the
handle
had
perhaps
within
the
body
of
the
mill
a
crown
wheel
that
turned
a
spindle
to
the
lower
end
of
the
perpendicular
axis
of
which
the
roller
was
fixed
should
this
be
admitted
it
must
be
allowed
also
that
the
of
the
ancients
had
not
so
much
a
resemblance
to
the
colour
mills
as
to
the
philosophical
mills
of
our
chemists
and
langelott
consequently
will
not
be
the
real
inventor
of
the
latter
on
the
other
side
opposite
to
where
the
handle
is
there
arise
from
the
mill
of
eunostus
two
shafts
which
gori
considers
as
those
of
a
besom
and
shovel
two
instruments
used
in
grinding
but
as
the
interior
part
can
not
be
seen
it
appears
to
me
doubtful
whether
these
may
not
be
parts
of
the
mill
in
the
commencement
of
the
last
century
the
remains
of
a
pair
of
roman
millstones
were
found
at
adel
in
yorkshire
one
of
these
stones
twenty
inches
in
breadth
is
thicker
in
the
middle
than
at
the
edge
consequently
one
side
is
convex
the
other
was
of
the
same
size
but
as
thick
at
the
sides
as
the
other
was
in
the
centre
the
traces
of
notching
were
discoverable
enough
may
perhaps
have
been
said
concerning
this
original
invention
therefore
this
article
will
not
be
encumbered
with
quotations
of
all
those
passages
relative
to
mills
which
are
found
in
ancient
authors
as
they
would
afford
but
little
additional
information
neither
will
mythological
records
be
disturbed
to
inquire
to
which
deity
or
hero
the
invention
was
originally
attributed
or
to
ascertain
the
descent
of
milantes
whom
stephanus
distinguishes
by
that
honour
or
how
those
millstones
were
constructed
which
are
alleged
to
have
been
built
by
myletes
son
of
lelex
king
of
laconia
but
we
shall
proceed
to
the
invention
of
these
appear
to
have
been
introduced
about
the
period
of
mithridates
contemporary
with
cæsar
and
cicero
strabo
relating
that
there
was
a
near
the
residence
of
the
pontian
king
that
honour
has
been
ascribed
to
him
but
so
far
is
this
remote
from
certainty
that
nothing
can
be
inferred
from
thence
other
than
that
at
that
period
were
known
in
asia
pomponius
sabinus
informs
us
that
the
first
seen
at
rome
was
erected
on
the
banks
of
the
tiber
a
little
before
the
time
of
augustus
but
of
this
there
is
no
other
proof
than
his
simple
assertion
he
having
taken
the
greater
part
of
his
remarks
from
the

he
must
have
had
a
more
perfect
copy
of
that
author
than
any
now
remaining
and
from
these
his
information
might
have
come
the
most
certain
proof
we
have
that
rome
had
in
the
time
of
augustus
is
that
vitruvius
has
told
us
so
but
those
mills
were
not
they
were
hydraulic
engines
which
he
describes
in
his
works
from
whence
we
learn
that
the
ancients
had
wheels
for
raising
water
which
were
driven
by
being
trod
upon
by
men
the
usual
employment
for
criminals
as
may
be
learnt
from
artemidorus
also
from
a
pretty
epigram
of
antipater
your
work
ye
maids
ye
who
laboured
in
the
mill
sleep
now
and
let
the
birds
sing
to
the
ruddy
morning
for
ceres
has
commanded
the
water
nymphs
to
perform
your
task
these
obedient
to
her
call
throw
themselves
on
the
wheel
force
round
the
and
by
these
means
the
heavy
antipater
lived
at
the
period
of
cicero
palladius
also
with
equal
clearness
speaks
of
which
he
advises
to
be
built
on
estates
where
is
running
water
in
order
to
grind
corn
without
men
or
cattle
it
likewise
appears
that
the
to
which
heliogabalus
directed
some
of
his
friends
and
parasites
to
be
tied
can
not
be
considered
to
be
mills
for
the
purpose
of
grinding
corn
for
these
as
well
as
the
of
lucretius
were
probably
like
those
machines
for
raising
water
which
are
spoken
of
by
vitruvius
as
it
is
however
on
the
authority
of
pompinius
sabinus
that
both
wind
and
water
mills
were
known
to
have
been
in
italy
and
even
the
latter
in
rome
in
the
days
of
augustus
however
about
years
after
the
death
of
augustus
when
caligula
seized
every
horse
from
the
mills
to
convey
effects
he
had
in
contemplation
to
take
from
rome
the
public
were
much
distressed
for
bread
whence
we
must
infer
that
must
have
been
very
rare
even
three
hundred
years
after
augustus
cattle
mills
were
so
common
in
that
city
that
their
number
amounted
to
three
hundred
mention
of
them
and
of
the
often
occurs
for
a
long
time
after
it
is
not
their
use
we
inquire
after
it
is
enough
for
us
to
know
that
they
existed
we
now
come
to
another
period
when
we
are
informed
that
were
first
introduced
which
occurs
in
the
year
mention
being
made
of
them
in
that
year
which
also
clearly
shows
that
they
were
then
which
establishment
was
found
necessary
to
be
protected
by
laws
made
in
their
favour
the
orders
for
that
purpose
were
renewed
more
than
once
and
made
more
secure
by
zeno
towards
the
end
of
the
fifth
century
it
may
be
properly
remarked
that
in
the
whole
code
of
justinian
the
least
mention
of
wooden
pales
or
posts
is
not
made
which
occurs
in
all
the
new
laws
and
which
it
appears
when
there
were
several
mills
on
the
same
stream
occasioned
so
many
disputes
then
as
well
as
in
after
times
the
mills
at
rome
were
erected
on
those
canals
which
conveyed
water
to
the
city
and
because
these
were
employed
in
several
arts
and
for
many
purposes
it
was
ordered
that
by
dividing
the
water
the
mills
should
always
be
kept
going
but
as
they
were
driven
by
so
small
a
quantity
of
water
they
probably
executed
very
little
work
and
for
this
reason
but
probably
on
account
of
the
great
number
of
slaves
and
the
cheap
rate
at
which
they
were
maintained
these
noble
machines
were
not
so
much
used
nor
were
so
soon
brought
to
perfection
as
under
other
circumstances
they
might
have
been
it
appears
however
that
after
the
abolition
of
slavery
they
were
much
improved
and
more
employed
and
to
this
a
particular
incident
seems
in
some
degree
to
have
contributed
when
vitiges
king
of
the
goths
besieged
belisarius
in
rome
in
the
year
and
caused
the
fourteen
large
expensive
aqueducts
to
be
stopped
the
city
was
reduced
to
great
distress
not
from
want
of
water
in
general
because
it
was
secured
against
that
inconvenience
by
the
tiber
but
by
the
loss
of
that
water
which
the
baths
required
and
above
all
of
that
necessary
to
drive
the
mills
which
were
all
situated
on
these
canals
horses
and
cattle
which
might
have
been
employed
upon
grinding
were
not
to
be
found
but
belisarius
fell
upon
the
ingenious
contrivance
of
placing
boats
upon
the
tiber
on
which
he
erected
mills
that
were
driven
by
the
current
this
experiment
was
attended
with
complete
success
and
as
many
mills
of
this
kind
as
were
necessary
were
constructed
to
destroy
these
the
besiegers
threw
into
the
stream
logs
of
wood
dead
bodies
which
floated
down
the
river
into
the
city
but
the
besieged
by
making
use
of
booms
to
stop
them
were
enabled
to
drag
them
out
before
they
could
do
any
mischief
this
seems
to
have
been
the
origin
of
no
record
of
them
appearing
previously
by
these
means
the
use
of
became
very
much
extended
for
can
be
constructed
almost
upon
any
stream
without
forming
an
artificial
fall
they
may
be
stationed
at
the
most
convenient
places
and
they
rise
and
fall
of
themselves
with
the
they
are
however
attended
with
these
inconveniences
they
require
to
be
strongly
secured
they
often
block
up
the
stream
too
much
and
move
slowly
and
they
often
stop
when
the
water
is
too
high
or
when
it
is
frozen
after
this
improvement
the
use
of
was
never
laid
aside
or
forgotten
but
was
soon
made
known
all
over
europe
and
passages
innumerable
might
be
quoted
in
every
century
to
prove
their
continued
use
the
roman
salic
and
other
laws
constantly
provided
for
the
security
of
these
mills
and
defined
a
punishment
for
such
as
destroyed
the
sluices
or
stole
the
it
is
said
however
that
there
were
in
france
and
germany
a
hundred
years
before
these
laws
had
existence
at
venice
and
other
places
there
were
erected
mills
which
regulated
themselves
by
the
motion
of
the
waters
and
which
were
regulated
by
the
flowing
and
ebbing
of
the
tide
and
which
every
six
hours
changed
the
motion
of
the
wheels
of
this
species
of
mills
a
new
invention
or
perhaps
rather
an
improved
one
was
made
in
london
called
a
an
engraving
of
which
may
be
seen
in
advancement
of
arts
manufactures
and
commerce
london
zanetti
is
said
to
have
shown
by
some
old
charters
that
such
mills
existed
about
the
year
but
with
still
more
certainty
in
and
it
appears
however
that
hand
and
cattle
mills
were
in
most
places
retained
after
the
use
of
proper
watermills
particularly
in
convents
they
were
used
because
the
otherwise
lazy
monks
found
the
exercise
they
afforded
beneficial
to
their
health
likewise
the
legends
of
popish
mythology
are
full
of
the
miracles
which
have
been
wrought
at
these
mills
a
modern
author
of
credit
impeaches
the
veracity
of
pomponius
sabinus
after
he
had
previously
quoted
his
authority
and
likewise
after
he
had
said
that
he
bore
a
good
character
in
a
popular
work
by
charging
him
with
improbability
nay
positive
falsehood
and
alleging
that
the
romans
had
no
it
should
be
noticed
without
venturing
to
decide
upon
the
point
that
he
has
adduced
no
authority
for
such
allegation
and
that
he
only
concludes
so
by
inference
as
upon
the
authority
of
vitruvius
that
mechanist
he
says
in
enumerating
all
moving
forces
does
not
mention
but
for
the
sake
of
candour
was
not
the
one
as
liable
to
err
as
the
other
he
also
says
that
neither
seneca
nor
chrysostom
mention
and
is
unmercifully
severe
upon
an
old
bohemian
annalist
who
speaks
of
so
early
as
but
he
is
all
along
bringing
his
forces
to
prove
that
had
first
existence
in
his
own
district
germany
that
they
were
then
invented
and
perhaps
because
he
is
of
that
country
it
is
somewhat
remarkable
that
scarcely
any
invention
of
any
consequence
has
occurred
since
that
of
printing
but
the
honour
has
been
claimed
by
the
natives
of

mabillon
mentions
a
diploma
of
the
year
in
which
a
convent
in
france
is
allowed
to
erect
water
and
ad
bartolomeo
verde
proposed
to
the
venetians
in
to
build
a
when
his
plan
had
been
examined
he
had
a
piece
of
ground
assigned
him
which
he
was
to
retain
if
his
undertaking
succeeded
within
a
specified
time
in
the
city
of

caused
a
to
be
erected
and
sent
to
the
netherlands
for
a
person
acquainted
with
the
method
of
grinding
by
it
a
was
also
constructed
at
frankfort
in
but
it
does
not
appear
to
have
been
ascertained
whether
there
were
any
there
before
about
the
twelfth
century
in
the
pontificate
of
gregory
when
both
wind
and
became
more
general
a
dispute
arose
whether
mills
were
titheable
or
not
the
dispute
existed
for
some
time
between
the
persons
possessed
of
mills
and
the
clergy
when
neither
would
yield
at
length
upon
the
matter
being
referred
to
the
pope
and
sacred
college
the
question
was
as
might
have
been
expected
when
interested
persons
were
made
the
arbitrators
determined
in
favour
of
the
claims
of
the
church
there
was
one
inconvenience
attending
which
might
be
obviated
in
other
mills
the
mill
was
useless
unless
the
wind
was
in
a
particular
direction
to
remedy
this
various
modes
were
tried
at
first
the
mill
was
fixed
on
a
floating
body
in
the
water
which
might
be
turned
to
any
wind
the
next
improvement
consisted
in
turning
the
body
of
the
mill
to
meet
the
direction
of
the
wind
this
was
effected
by
two
modes
first
the
whole
building
is
constructed
in
such
a
manner
as
to
turn
on
a
pivot
below
this
method
is
said
to
have
been
invented
in
germany
and
is
called
the
german
mode
second
the
building
is
formed
so
as
to
turn
on
the
roof
with
the
shafts
supporting
the
sails
only
this
is
called
the
dutch
mode
being
invented
by
a
fleming
about
the
middle
of
the
sixteenth
century
this
is
the
mode
principally
adopted
in
england
although
in
the
earliest
ages
of
the
world
men
might
have
been
perhaps
satisfied
with
having
their
corn
reduced
to
a
mealable
form
alone
yet
after
this
had
been
with
care
effected
then
they
thought
of
improving
upon
this
conveniency
and
separating
the
farinaceous
part
from
the
bran
and
husks
this
was
certainly
desirable
therefore
they
bolted
it
in
a
sieve
with
a
long
handle
attached
to
it
with
a
hair
or
fine
lawn
lining
this
was
common
in
this
country
till
within
the
last
sixty
or
eighty
years
but
by
degrees
opportunities
of
improvement
in
the
mechanism
of
mills
suggested
to
some
mechanic
the
idea
of
constructing
what
is
now
called
bolting
mills
applied
to
the
mill
for
grinding
and
wrought
at
the
same
time
by
appropriate
machinery
it
appears
that
sieves
of
were
first
used
by
the
gauls
then
those
of
linen
by
the
spaniards
the
mode
of
applying
a
sieve
in
the
form
of
an
extending
bag
to
catch
the
meal
as
it
fell
from
the
stones
and
of
causing
it
to
be
turned
and
shaken
was
first
made
known
in
the
beginning
of
the
sixteenth
century
the
best
bolting
cloths
are
universally
allowed
to
be
manufactured
in
england
they
are
made
of
wool
of
the
longest
and
the
best
kind
peculiarly
prepared
being
first
well
washed
and
spun
to
a
fine
and
equal
thread
which
before
it
be
scoured
must
be
scalded
in
hot
water
to
prevent
its
shrinking
the
web
must
be
then
stiffened
it
is
in
this
we
possess
an
advantage
which
others
can
not
attain
our
bolting
cloth
is
stiffer
as
well
as
much
smoother
than
any
foreign
manufacture
so
jealous
are
our
german
neighbours
of
this
that
they
have
established
manufactories
in
several
places
at
a
great
expense
and
under
very
peculiar
regulations
for
its
fabrication
after
all
they
are
compelled
to
confess
that
theirs
will
not
wear
above
three
weeks
in
a
flour
manufactory
whereas
ours
will
continue
well
three
months
in
equal
exposure
to
friction
and
ordinary
wear
for
some
years
past
the
french
have
been
extolled
for
a
mode
of
grinding
called
that
were
we
not
aware
such
had
been
practised
in
ancient
rome
it
might
be
conceived
to
form
an
important
epoch
in
the
art
this
process
however
is
not
new
it
consists
in
first
grinding
the
wheat
not
so
fine
as
might
be
required
for
ordinary
purposes
afterwards
putting
the
meal
several
times
through
the
mill
and
sifting
it
with
various
sieves
it
should
seem
this
method
was
practised
in
ancient
rome
for
pliny
who
took
care
to
inform
himself
of
most
things
tells
us
that
in
his
time
they
had
at
least
five
different
kinds
of
flour
all
procured
from
the
same
corn
it
appears
that
the
ancient
romans
had
advanced
very
far
in
this
art
as
well
as
in
that
of
baking
from
what
may
be
collected
from
its
economical
polity
preserved
by
pliny
and
others
whence
it
may
be
fairly
inferred
they
knew
how
to
prepare
from
corn
more
kinds
of
meal
and
from
meal
more
kinds
of
bread
than
the
moderns
even
now
are
acquainted
with
pliny
reckons
that
bread
should
be
heavier
than
the
meal
used
for
baking
it
this
proportion
it
appears
was
known
in
germany
nearly
a
century
and
a
half
ago
and
discovered
from
experiments
on
bread
made
at
different
times
german
bakers
although
they
may
have
been
occasionally
mistaken
have
always
undoubtedly
given
more
bread
than
meal
it
appears
that
in
latter
periods
the
art
of
grinding
as
well
as
baking
has
declined
very
much
in
italy
and
their
bread
although
produced
from
the
finest
grain
in
the
world
is
altogether
bad
when
manufactured
by
italians
on
this
account
bakers
from
germany
it
seems
are
generally
employed
in
public
as
well
at
rome
as
in
venice
bakers
of
that
people
are
generally
settled
at
those
places
where
they
have
been
in
the
habit
of
manufacturing
that
article
for
the
principal
inhabitants
for
upwards
of
three
hundred
years
from
history
it
would
appear
that
the
of
the
french
has
been
known
to
the
germans
for
more
than
two
hundred
years
many
were
the
attempts
repeatedly
enforced
to
deter
the
experiments
made
from
time
to
time
by
the
french
experimentalists
to
perfect
this
article
previous
to
its
being
accomplished
in
this
the
french
suffered
themselves
to
be
taught
by
prejudice
and
directed
by
ignorance
numerous
and
judicious
were
the
experiments
made
by
the
scientific
and
philosophic
of
that
people
to
produce
the
most
in
quantity
and
best
in
quality
from
a
definite
quantity
of
grain
at
which
the
ignorant
of
their
species
suffered
their
prejudice
to
revolt
and
the
powerful
readily
come
into
the
mode
of
thinking
of
the
vulgar
to
whom
they
lent
their
aid
to
effect
what
heaven
in
revelation
had
commanded
viz
not
that
which
is
holy
unto
dogs
neither
cast
ye
your
pearls
before
swine
lest
they
trample
them
under
their
feet
and
turn
again
and
rend
mat
vii
it
will
from
the
succeeding
statement
that
in
using
the
language
which
has
just
appeared
circumstances
sanctioned
us
the
clergy
of
the
chapel
royal
and
parish
church
at
versailles
sent
their
wheat
in
the
beginning
of
last
century
to
be
ground
at
an
adjacent
mill
according
to
custom
it
was
put
through
the
mill
only
once
and
the
bran
which
yet
contained
much
flour
was
sold
for
fattening
cattle
this
miller
having
however
in
process
of
time
learnt
the
process
of
the
purchased
the
bran
from
these
ecclesiastics
and
found
that
it
yielded
him
as
good
flour
as
they
had
procured
from
the
whole
wheat
the
miller
at
length
is
presumed
in
a
qualm
of
conscience
to
have
regretted
cheating
those
holy
men
he
accordingly
discovered
to
them
the
secret
and
gave
them
afterwards
fourteen
bushels
of
flour
from
their
wheat
instead
of
eight
which
he
had
only
furnished
them
before
this
voluntary
discovery
of
the
miller
was
made
in
and
it
is
probable
the
same
discovery
was
made
at
the
same
time
by
others
a
baker
named
malisset
proposed
to
the
of
the
french
police
to
teach
a
method
by
which
people
could
grind
their
corn
with
more
advantage
and
experiments
were
accordingly
made
and
succeeded
a
mealman
of
senlis
named
buquet
having
the
inspection
of
the
mill
belonging
to
the
large
hospital
at
paris
made
the
same
proposal
the
result
of
his
experiments
made
under
the
direction
of
the
magistrates
was
printed
the
investigation
of
this
art
was
now
taken
up
by
men
of
learning
and
science
who
gave
it
a
suitable
denomination
explained
it
made
experiments
and
calculations
upon
it
and
at
the
same
time
recommended
it
so
much
that
the
engaged
the
attention
of
all
magistrates
throughout
france
its
government
sent
buquet
to
lyons
in
to
bourdeaux
in
to
dijon
in
and
to
mondidier
in
the
benefit
which
france
derived
from
that
trouble
shows
that
it
was
not
taken
in
vain
previous
to
that
period
a
paris
yielded
from
eighty
to
ninety
pounds
of
meal
and
from
one
hundred
and
fifty
to
one
hundred
and
sixty
pounds
of
bran
but
the
same
quantity
now
yields
one
hundred
and
pounds
and
according
to
the
latest
improvements
one
hundred
and
pounds
of
meal
in
the
time
of
louis
from
four
to
five
were
reckoned
necessary
for
the
annual
maintenance
of
a
man
these
were
scarcely
sufficient
as
many
were
allowed
to
the
patients
in
hospitals
and
such
were
the
calculations
made
in
the
sixteenth
century
when
the
art
was
everywhere
improved
the
four
were
reduced
to
three
and
a
half
and
from
the
latest
improvements
they
do
not
exceed
two
from
mills
which
only
force
the
farinaceous
parts
from
the
husk
thereby
rounding
the
grain
the
common
denomination
of
comes
from
such
mills
being
used
in
the
manufacture
of
pearl
barley
in
their
construction
these
mills
differ
but
little
from
and
the
machinery
for
the
former
is
generally
added
to
the
latter
the
grand
specific
distinction
is
that
the
millstone
is
rough
hewn
round
its
circumference
and
in
the
stead
of
a
lower
stone
there
is
generally
a
wooden
case
the
middle
lined
with
a
plate
of
iron
pierced
like
a
grater
with
holes
the
sharp
edge
of
which
turns
upwards
the
barley
is
thrown
upon
the
stone
which
as
it
turns
round
frees
it
from
the
husk
and
rounds
it
after
which
it
is
put
into
sieves
and
sifted
so
long
as
the
policy
of
governments
was
blind
to
the
interests
of
men
and
so
long
as
the
griping
avarice
of
a
few
was
permitted
to
lay
the
of
their
species
under
the
most
severe
contributions
so
long
were
permitted
to
build
mills
only
who
had
obtained
a
regal
license
for
that
purpose
but
thank
heaven
that
ray
of
light
it
has
lent
generally
to
man
has
in
some
sort
illuminated
even
the
minds
of
ministers
and
their
tyrannical
masters
to
curtail
that
spirit
which
had
cast
the
fetters
of
vassalage
given
by
feudal
tyranny
to
its
upstart
dependants
men
were
left
at
length
to
improve
their
property
according
to
their
pleasure
since
which
period
more
mills
have
been
erected
for
the
convenience
of
the
species
this
privilege
it
appears
was
not
prohibited
by
the
roman
laws
those
irradiations
of
superior
intellect
well
appreciated
human
rights
it
was
not
till
the
darkness
of
the
middle
ages
had
obscured
the
mental
hemisphere
that
any
person
was
presumed
to
possess
a
superiority
over
others
and
to
abridge
the
small
portion
of
general
happiness
that
the
favoured
of
fortune
might
add
to
his
satiety
during
those
days
of
universal
darkness
numberless
were
the
evils
which
men
suffered
and
among
them
the
present
object
of
our
consideration
was
not
the
least
frequently
having
to
travel
for
miles
to
a
mill
to
procure
the
necessary
manufacture
of
so
essential
an
article
to
human
life
as
bread
let
us
not
be
decoyed
however
by
the
resentment
produced
by
the
spirit
of
human
oppression
beyond
the
bounds
prescribed
by
reason
to
inveigh
against
such
ordinance
when
public
and
general
utility
ever
was
consulted
and
certain
public
streams
were
by
wise
laws
to
be
kept
free
from
individual
encroachments
with
impunity
it
is
not
against
the
dictates
of
sober
reason
we
declare
hostility
but
the
gross
abuse
of
power
a
time
there
was
when
human
baseness
in
princes
and
potentates
their
vassals
doubtless
aping
the
manners
of
their
masters
claimed
as
their
right
not
only
the
common
element
of
water
but
also
that
of
air
a
curious
incident
related
by
jargow
and
detailed
by
professor
beckmann
as
follows
establishes
the
insolence
of
upstart
men
the
end
of
the
fourteenth
century
the
monks
of
the
celebrated
but
long
since
destroyed
monastery
of
augustines
at
windshiem
in
the
province
of
overyssel
were
desirous
of
erecting
a
not
far
from
zwoll
but
a
neighouring
lord
endeavoured
to
prevent
them
declaring
that
the
wind
in
that
quarter
belonged
to
him
the
monks
unwilling
to
give
up
their
point
had
recourse
to
the
bishop
of
utrecht
under
whose
jurisdiction
the
province
had
continued
since
the
tenth
century
the
bishop
highly
incensed
against
the
pretender
who
wished
to
usurp
his
authority
affirmed
that
the
wind
of
the
whole
province
belonged
only
to
him
and
in
gave
the
convent
express
permission
to
build
a
wherever
they
thought
without
the
convenience
of
human
ingenuity
heaven
had
sent
the
blessing
of
life
in
vain
we
have
under
this
impression
therefore
bestowed
much
time
on
this
article
from
a
conviction
of
its
vital
importance
to
the
necessities
of
human
existence
the
invention
of
the
and
saw
with
other
useful
articles
in
mechanics
and
handicrafts
are
usually
ascribed
to
that
great
that
universal
genius
dædalus
although
others
give
the
merit
to
one
talus
the
nephew
of
dædalus
and
say
that
the
discovery
was
made
under
the
following
circumstances
talus
they
tell
us
having
found
the
of
a
snake
cut
a
piece
of
wood
in
two
with
the
teeth
thence
they
say
he
invented
the
saw
his
maternal
uncle
and
master
they
add
was
so
jealous
of
this
invention
that
he
murdered
the
young
man
and
the
mode
of
the
discovery
of
the
murder
is
accounted
for
in
this
manner
some
persons
saw
dædalus
covering
up
the
grave
of
his
victim
and
asked
what
he
was
doing
says
he
am
only
burying
a
how
much
credit
may
be
due
to
this
relation
we
do
not
take
upon
ourselves
to
determine
pliny
as
well
as
seneca
were
of
the
former
opinion
whilst
diodorus
siculus
and
others
hold
the
latter
the
youth
is
named
by
some
perdix
however
it
appears
to
rest
between
these
two
no
other
claimant
appearing
ovid
says
it
was
not
the
jaw
of
a
snake
but
the
of
a
fish
the
former
however
appears
to
be
the
most
rational
opinion
as
to
its
origin
as
it
is
conjectured
that
the
vertebræ
would
not
be
sufficiently
strong
and
the
joints
are
too
far
apart
as
well
as
too
large
the
grecian
saw
is
said
to
have
been
much
the
same
as
that
instrument
which
the
moderns
now
use
this
idea
is
corroborated
by
an
ancient
painting
discovered
in
herculaneum
likewise
from
an
antique
representation
of
this
instrument
given
by
the
celebrated
montfaucon
the
preceding
observations
however
have
relation
to
the
subject
of
this
article
only
inasmuch
as
they
are
introductory
to
what
follows
the
most
beneficial
and
ingenious
improvement
that
has
been
made
in
saws
was
the
invention
and
introduction
of
machinery
called
which
in
woody
countries
as
well
as
for
delicate
and
fine
veneers
are
of
the
greatest
utility
in
the
former
case
wood
forms
the
chief
article
of
commerce
where
labourers
are
scarce
in
the
latter
it
may
be
cut
nearly
as
thin
as
a
sheet
of
paper
these
also
finish
flooring
deals
grooved
dovetailed
and
planed
on
both
sides
at
the
rate
of
two
deals
of
twenty
feet
each
in
a
minute
they
are
commonly
worked
in
this
country
by
means
of
in
woody
countries
they
are
generally
erected
on
the
banks
of
rivers
the
water
of
which
propels
the
machinery
it
is
said
they
were
invented
in
germany
as
far
back
as
the
fourth
century
upon
the
smaller
river
roer
for
although
ansonius
speaks
of
for
cutting
stone
he
says
nothing
of
mills
to
cut
timber
the
art
of
cutting
marble
with
a
saw
is
very
ancient
pliny
thinks
it
was
invented
in
caria
at
least
he
knew
of
no
place
or
building
incrusted
with
marble
older
than
the
palace
of
king
mausolus
at
helicarnassus
vitruvius
also
names
the
circumstances
although
he
uses
different
terms
for
expressions
of
the
same
sense
he
commends
the
beauty
of
its
marble
whilst
pliny
speaks
of
its
different
kinds
the
former
viewed
it
as
an
architect
whilst
the
latter
inspected
it
as
a
naturalist
it
also
does
appear
from
other
writers
that
the
harder
and
precious
kinds
of
stones
were
cut
in
the
same
manner
as
pliny
speaks
of
a
building
adorned
with
agate
cornelian
and
amethysts
yet
there
is
no
mention
made
of
mills
for
cutting
wood
or
admitting
they
had
been
invented
it
is
probable
they
shared
the
fate
of
many
other
useful
inventions
had
been
forgotten
or
else
some
considerable
modern
improvement
had
been
made
in
their
construction
since
the
period
of
the
first
invention
they
have
been
erected
in
various
parts
of
europe
and
america
there
appears
to
have
been
one
erected
in
the
vicinity
of
augsburg
as
early
as
at
erlinger
in
upon
the
discovery
of
the
island
of
madeira
in
the
infanta
henry
sent
settlers
there
and
caused
european
fruits
of
every
kind
to
be
carried
there
and
amongst
other
productions
and
other
machinery
to
cut
the
valuable
timber
found
there
into
portable
pieces
which
were
afterwards
transported
to
portugal
in
the
city
of
breslau

a
which
produced
the
yearly
rent
of
three
marks
in
the
magistrates
of
erfurt
purchased
a
forest
and
built
a
mill
of
this
description
in
norway
a
country
covered
with
wood
there
was
one
built
in
this
mode
of
manufacture
was
called
the
new
art
and
because
the
exportation
of
deals
was
by
that
means
increased
a
royal
impost
was
introduced
by
christian
iii
in
called
the
soon
after
henry
ranzau
caused
the
first
mill
to
be
erected
at
holstein
in
the
year
the
bishop
of
ely
being
ambassador
from
the
princess
mary
of
england
to
the
court
of
rome
saw
a
in
the
neighbourhood
of
lyons
the
writer
of
his
travels
thought
it
worthy
of
particular
description
is
driven
by
an
upright
wheel
and
the
water
that
makes
it
go
is
gathered
whole
into
a
narrow
trough
which
delivereth
the
same
water
to
the
wheels
this
wheel
hath
a
piece
of
timber
put
to
the
end
like
the
handle
of
a
brooch
and
fastened
to
the
end
of
the
saw
which
being
turned
with
the
force
of
the
water
hoisteth
up
and
down
the
saw
that
it
continually
eateth
in
and
the
handle
of
the
same
is
kept
in
a
rigall
of
wood
from
swerving

the
timber
lieth
as
it
were
upon
a
ladder
which
is
brought
by
little
and
little
to
the
saw
with
another
in
the
sixteenth
century
there
was
a
grand
improvement
made
in
this
machine
by
having
several
saws
affixed
to
one
beam
by
which
timber
could
be
cut
into
several
planks
or
boards
and
of
any
thickness
at
the
same
time
there
was
one
of
these
at
ratisbon
upon
the
danube
in
in
england
were
at
first
received
with
as
little
encouragement
as
printing
met
with
in
turkey
and
from
the
same
motive
when
the
attempt
was
made
to
introduce
them
it
was
said
the
sawyers
would
be
deprived
of
bread
for
this
reason
it
was
found
necessary
to
abandon
a
erected
by
a
dutchman
near
london
in
however
in
the
year
a
gentleman
of
the
name
of
houghton
laid
before
the
nation
the
advantages
to
be
derived
from
them
but
he
expressed
his
apprehension
that
it
might
cause
a
commotion
among
the
people
what
he
feared
actually
came
to
pass
for
on
the
erection
of
one
by
a
wealthy
timber
merchant
by
the
desire
of
the
society
for
the
promotion
of
arts
in
to
be
propelled
by
the
wind
under
the
direction
of
james
stansfield
who
had
learnt
the
method
of
constructing
them
in
holland
and
norway
a
foolish
mob
assembled
and
pulled
it
to
pieces
many
years
previous
to
this
there
had
been
a
similar
mill
erected
in
scotland
there
is
now
hardly
a
town
of
any
importance
in
the
kingdom
but
what
has
one
or
more
in
operation
forks
the
fork
is
an
article
of
use
amongst
us
and
on
that
account
little
thought
of
still
the
short
space
we
intend
to
occupy
with
this
subject
may
perhaps
convey
a
little
information
to
many
of
our
readers
unknown
to
them
before
or
at
least
unthought
of
there
is
not
the
least
room
to
suppose
the
ancients
were
at
all
acquainted
with
this
little
table
utensil
now
so
necessary
to
our
own
comfort
and
convenience
to
say
nothing
of
our
ideas
of
cleanliness
pliny
who
enumerated
most
things
natural
physical
philosophical
and
economical
makes
no
mention
of
them
nor
does
it
occur
in
any
other
writer
of
antiquity
neither
does
pollux
speak
of
it
in
the
very
full
catalogue
which
he
has
given
of
things
necessary
for
a
table
neither
the
greeks
or
romans
had
any
name
in
the
least
applicable
to
its
use
either
direct
or
by
inference
where
it
can
be
asserted
that
such
an
instrument
was
intended
the
ancients
had
it
is
true
in
greece
their
in
rome
their
the
grecian
instrument
somewhat
resembled
a
rake
of
an
ordinary
construction
and
calculated
for
the
purpose
of
taking
meat
out
of
a
boiling
pot
constructed
in
the
shape
of
a
hook
or
rather
the
bent
fingers
of
the
hand
with
reference
to
the
roman
names
the
first
two
were
undoubtedly
applied
to
instruments
which
approached
nearer
to
our
furnace
and
hay
the
trident
of
neptune
is
also
called
the
furcilla
was
large
enough
to
be
employed
as
a
weapon
of
defence
the
present
latin
name
for
a
fork
is
not
to
be
found
in
any
of
the
old
latin
writers
it
is
the
opinion
we
understand
of
a
learned
italian
writer
that
the
ancient
romans
used
the
instruments
they
called
instead
of
forks
now
those
instruments
had
some
distant
resemblance
to
our
teaspoons
hence
we
must
conclude
that
they
and
our
ancestors
used
no
forks
because
had
they
had
anything
answering
the
purpose
even
in
effect
it
must
undoubtedly
have
had
a
name
in
the
east
we
understand
it
was
and
still
is
customary
to
dress
their
victuals
until
they
become
so
tender
as
to
be
easily
pulled
in
pieces
we
are
told
by
modern
travellers
that
if
an
animal
be
dressed
before
it
has
lost
its
natural
warmth
it
becomes
tender
and
very
savoury
this
is
the
oriental
custom
and
has
been
so
from
the
most
remote
antiquity
fortunately
all
articles
of
food
were
cut
up
in
small
pieces
before
they
were
served
up
at
table
the
necessity
for
which
practice
will
appear
when
we
remember
they
usually
took
their
meals
in
a
recumbent
posture
upon
beds
originally
persons
of
rank
kept
an
officer
for
the
purpose
of
cutting
the
meat
who
used
a
knife
the
only
one
placed
at
table
which
in
opulent
families
had
an
ivory
handle
and
was
ornamented
with
silver
the
bread
was
never
cut
at
table
it
needed
it
not
being
usually
baked
thin
somewhat
resembling
the
passover
cake
of
the
jews
this
is
not
understood
however
to
have
been
universal
the
chinese
use
no
forks
however
to
supply
them
they
have
small
sticks
of
ivory
often
of
very
fine
workmanship
inlaid
with
silver
and
gold
which
each
guest
employs
to
pick
up
the
bits
of
meat
it
being
previously
cut
small
the
invention
of
forks
was
not
known
till
about
two
centuries
ago
in
europe
where
people
eat
the
same
as
they
do
now
in
turkey
in
the
new
testament
we
read
of
putting
hands
into
the
dish
homer
as
well
as
ovid
mention
the
same
custom
in
the
quotation
from
the
sacred
writings
we
observe
that
the
guests
had
it
is
presumed
no
instrument
to
help
themselves
out
of
the
common
dish
which
contained
the
repast
for
upon
the
question
being
put
of
who
was
to
betray
the
saviour
the
answer
was
given
in
the
following
quotation
is
one
of
the
twelve
that
dippeth
with
me
in
the
in
the
passage
cited
from
homer
the
phrase
according
to
the
latin
translation
implies
the
same
sense
and
had
the
romans
been
apprised
of
the
utility
of
this
instrument
or
in
fact
of
any
substitute
there
could
have
been
no
occasion
for
the
master
of
the
amorous
art
to
have
given
his
instructions
to
his
pupils
in
nearly
similar
terms
which
we
now
use
to
children
although
count
caylus
and
grignon
both
assert
that
ancient
forks
have
been
found
we
still
want
further
testimony
the
former
says
one
with
two
prongs
was
found
among
some
rubbish
in
the
appian
way
which
he
alleges
to
be
of
beautiful
workmanship
terminating
in
the
handle
with
a
carved
foot
notwithstanding
the
high
reputation
of
that
author
this
assertion
is
not
credited
the
latter
says
he
found
some
in
the
ruins
of
a
roman
town
in
champagne
but
he
does
not
describe
them
otherwise
than
to
observe
that
one
was
of
copper
or
brass
and
the
others
of
iron
and
speaking
of
the
latter
says
they
appear
to
be
but
are
very
coarsely
made
the
truth
seems
to
be
that
were
first
used
in
italy
as
appears
from
the
book
of
galeotus
martius
an
italian
in
the
service
of
matthias
corvinus
king
of
hungary
who
reigned
from
to
martius
relates
that
at
that
period
forks
were
not
used
at
table
in
hungary
as
in
italy
but
that
at
meals
each
person
laid
hold
of
the
meat
with
his
fingers
and
on
that
account
they
were
much
stained
with
saffron
usually
put
into
sauces
and
soups
he
praises
the
king
for
eating
without
a
fork
conversing
at
the
same
time
and
never
dirtying
his
clothes
in
france
at
the
end
of
the
sixteenth
century
forks
were
quite
unknown
even
at
the
court
of
the
monarch
neither
at
that
period
were
they
known
in
sweden
from
the
history
of
the
travels
of
our
countryman
coryate
entitled
first
published
in
and
afterwards
in
the
author
says
he
first
saw
them
in
italy
and
he
was
also
the
first
person
who
used
them
in
england
as
his
account
of
them
is
curious
we
may
be
excused
giving
an
extract
slightly
altering
the
orthography
i
will
mention
a
thing
that
might
have
been
spoken
of
before
in
discourse
of
the
first
italian
town
i
observed
a
custom
in
all
those
italian
cities
and
towns
through
which
i
passed
that
is
not
used
in
any
other
country
i
saw
in
my
travels
neither
do
i
think
that
any
other
nation
in
christendom
doth
use
it
but
only
italy
the
italian
and
also
most
strangers
that
are
commorant
in
italy
do
always
at
their
meals
use
a
little
fork
when
they
cut
their
meat
for
while
with
their
knife
which
they
hold
in
one
hand
they
cut
the
meat
out
of
the
dish
they
fasten
the
fork
which
they
hold
in
their
other
hand
upon
the
same
dish
so
that
whatsoever
he
be
that
sitting
in
the
company
of
any
others
at
meals
should
unadvisedly
touch
the
dish
of
meat
with
his
fingers
from
which
all
at
the
table
do
cut
he
will
give
occasion
of
offence
unto
the
company
as
having
transgressed
the
laws
of
good
manners
insomuch
that
for
his
error
he
shall
be
at
least
if
not
reprehended
in
words
this
form
of
feeding
i
understand
is
generally
used
in
all
places
of
italy
their
fork
being
for
the
most
part
made
of
iron
or
steel
and
some
of
silver
but
those
are
used
only
by
gentlemen
the
reason
of
this
their
curiosity
is
because
the
italian
can
not
by
any
means
endure
to
have
his
dish
touched
with
fingers
seeing
all
fingers
are
not
alike
clean
hereupon
i
myself
thought
good
to
imitate
the
italian
fashion
by
this
forked
cutting
of
meat
not
only
while
i
was
in
italy
but
also
in
germany
and
oftentime
in
england
since
i
came
home
being
once
equipped
for
that
frequent
using
of
my
fork
by
a
certain
learned
gentleman
a
familiar
friend
of
mine
one
lawrence
whitaker
who
in
his
merry
humour
doubted
not
to
call
one
at
table
only
for
using
a
fork
at
feeding
but
for
no
other
in
many
parts
of
spain
we
understand
that
spoons
and
forks
are
rarities
it
is
also
said
that
even
in
taverns
in
many
countries
particularly
in
france
knives
are
not
placed
on
the
table
because
it
is
expected
that
each
person
should
have
one
of
his
own
this
custom
the
modern
french
appear
to
have
derived
from
their
ancestors
the
ancient
gauls
but
as
no
person
will
eat
any
longer
without
forks
the
landlords
are
obliged
to
furnish
these
together
with
plates
and
spoons
among
the
highlanders
in
scotland
johnson
asserts
that
knives
have
been
introduced
at
table
since
the
revolution
only
before
that
period
the
men
were
accustomed
to
cut
their
meat
with
a
knife
they
carry
as
a
companion
to
their
dirk
the
men
cut
the
meat
into
small
morsels
for
the
women
who
used
their
fingers
to
put
it
into
their
mouths
the
use
of
forks
at
table
was
first
considered
as
a
superfluous
luxury
and
as
such
forbidden
in
convents
as
appears
from
the
records
of
the
congregation
of
maur
music
the
science
of
music
or
rather
of
harmony
is
extremely
ancient
insomuch
that
with
respect
to
the
latter
it
is
said
to
be
coeval
with
nature
herself
but
as
it
has
relation
to
the
science
now
in
use
this
like
most
other
arts
whose
origin
is
very
remote
is
involved
in
obscurity
and
in
proportion
to
the
astonishment
and
wonder
excited
by
its
uncommon
powers
in
a
commensurate
ratio
does
mystery
fable
and
obscurity
envelope
its
original
however
always
remembering
that
it
was
from
harmony
heavenly
harmony
this
universal
frame
proceeding
step
by
step
it
had
eventually
attained
in
greece
a
very
early
perfection
collins
who
is
justly
entitled
to
the
distinguished
station
held
by
all
pupils
of
nature
and
of
the
muses
who
is
peculiarly
eminent
for
a
just
poetical
spirit
thus
speaks
of
the
heavenly
science
in
his
ode
on
the
passions
as
in
that
elder
time
warm
energetic
chaste
sublime
thy
wonders
in
that
age
fill
thy
recording
said
and
i
believe
the
tale
thy
humblest
reed
could
more
prevail
had
more
of
strength
diviner
rage
than
all
that
charms
this
laggard
age
even
all
at
once
together
found
mingled
world
of
it
will
be
remembered
however
that
the
poet
calculated
as
much
upon
the
infant
simplicity
of
nature
as
upon
the
uncommon
powers
of
harmony
this
consideration
will
certainly
reconcile
the
apparent
extravagance
of
the
thought
so
great
were
the
early
powers
of
verse
and
harmony
that
at
one
period
the
votaries
of
the
muses
were
regarded
as
persons
divinely
inspired
they
were
the
priests
of
man
his
legislators
and
his
prophets
insomuch
was
the
possessor
of
the
art
and
the
art
itself
reverenced
that
the
responses
of
the
most
eminent
oracles
were
received
in
measured
verse
witness
the
response
of
the
delphian
oracle
received
by
the
athenian
deputation
when
greece
inquired
for
her
wisest
men
as
given
by
xenophon
is
sophocles
more
wise
euripides
but
the
wisest
of
all
men
is
music
eventually
claimed
the
most
unlimited
control
over
the
affections
of
mankind
as
could
be
proved
by
an
infinity
of
instances
we
shall
mention
one
only
from
a
well
authenticated
fact
and
finely
illustrated
in
that
of
timotheus
from
feast
by
dryden
we
omit
the
hyperbolic
representation
of
the
raising
of
the
walls
of
thebes
by
the
power
of
lute
and
the
apparently
incredible
relations
of
the
harmony
of
the
harp
of
orpheus
which
are
all
personifications
of
natural
effects
and
which
we
have
neither
room
time
nor
opportunity
to
explain
in
this
place
if
its
origin
was
as
previously
suggested
by
collins
there
is
occasion
to
believe
the
simple
life
afforded
it
first
existence
in
the
native
and
wild
notes
of
the
pastoral
reed
may
be
discovered
the
germ
of
a
science
as
various
as
its
effects
are
beautiful
we
shall
for
the
present
presume
the
simple
pandean
pipe
was
the
first
effort
of
the
construction
of
musical
instruments
its
soft
tone
being
analogous
to
the
dulcet
harmony
of
the
voice
we
are
led
to
suppose
this
from
the
evidence
of
ancient
statuary
where
those
pipes
are
frequently
discovered
and
this
will
perhaps
deduce
its
origin
from
the
invention
of
the
shepherd
god
or
oldest
pan
nevertheless
the
lyre
or
harp
is
alleged
from
records
the
most
ancient
having
at
first
but
three
strings
analogous
to
the
three
seasons
of
the
primeval
year
the
treble
typical
of
spring
the
tenor
resembling
summer
and
the
bass
representing
winter
the
invention
of
that
instrument
and
of
music
altogether
is
claimed
in
the
pagan
world
by
amphion
a
successor
of
cadmus
the
first
king
of
thebes
in
bœtia
who
is
reported
by
the
music
of
his
harp
or
lyre
to
have
built
the
walls
of
the
city
cadmus
having
erected
the
citadel
only
flutes
were
first
invented
by
hyognis
the
phrygian
about
the
year
before
christ
and
first
played
on
the
flute
the
harmony
called
phrygian
and
other
tunes
of
the
mother
of
the
gods
of
dionysius
of
pan
and
of
the
divinities
of
the
country
and
the
heroes
terpander
also
who
was
the
son
of
derdineus
the
lesbian
directed
the
flute
players
to
reform
the
tunes
of
the
ancients
and
changed
the
old
music
about
the
year
before
christ
as
we
are
informed
by
the
parian
chronicle
the
same
terpander
likewise
added
three
more
strings
to
the
lyre
when
timotheus
the
spartan
musician
was
banished
his
native
country
for
having
increased
his
strings
to
the
number
of
ten
he
sought
refuge
at
the
court
of
macedon
and
accompanied
his
patron
alexander
into
persia
when
that
prince
conquered
darius
from
the
sacred
records
of
judea
we
may
also
infer
the
invention
of
musical
instruments
at
a
date
long
prior
to
either
of
the
periods
above
mentioned
when
they
inform
us
in
genesis
iv
that
adah
one
of
the
wives
of
lamech
had
two
sons
the
name
of
one
of
whom
was
jubal
who
is
said
to
have
been
father
of
all
such
who
handle
the
harp
and
this
infers
the
anterior
invention
of
that
instrument
music
consists
of
effects
produced
by
the
operation
of
certain
sounds
proceeding
from
the
dulcet
voice
or
musical
instruments
regulated
by
certain
time
and
a
succession
of
harmonious
notes
natural
grave
or
flat
half
a
note
below
its
proper
tone
and
acute
or
sharp
half
a
note
above
its
proper
key
and
of
such
modulation
of
various
tones
and
of
different
value
and
also
of
manifold
denominations
the
natural
tones
consisting
of
eight
notes
with
the
addition
of
octaves
in
various
keys
with
flats
and
sharps
introduced
to
afford
variety
from
the
skill
of
the
master
at
different
periods
to
produce
the
most
agreeable
diversity
in
his
composition
and
sometimes
according
to
the
subject
or
words
to
which
his
music
is
adapted
those
musical
notes
though
proceeding
from
so
small
a
number
of
radicals
are
analogous
to
the
incalculable
the
endless
forms
which
orthography
and
rhetoric
can
afford
to
a
orator
or
elegant
author
to
embellish
any
subject
thus
from
the
definite
number
of
notes
varied
in
different
degrees
by
sharps
flats
are
produced
all
that
is
so
magical
enthusiastic
and
transporting
in
the
empire
of
omnipotent
music
like
as
the
alphabetic
characters
may
be
varied
into
myriads
of
forms
suitable
to
every
multifarious
species
of
conversation
or
composition
in
a
word
a
few
musical
notes
in
the
hands
of
a
master
may
be
made
by
his
skill
to
produce
from
agreeable
interchanges
of
time
harmony
every
variety
of
musical
sentiment
which
can
affect
the
human
soul
a
stronger
proof
can
not
be
adduced
than
will
be
found
in
the
ode
of
feast
by
the
truly
poetic
dryden
in
all
which
harmony
and
melody
form
conspicuous
characteristics
and
of
harmony
according
to
the
learned
mason
the
sense
in
which
the
ancient
greeks
viewed
harmony
is
as
follows
by
that
term
understood
the
succession
of
simple
sounds
according
to
their
scale
with
respect
to
acuteness
or
whilst
it
appears
that
by
harmony
the
moderns
understand
succession
of
simple
sounds
according
to
the
laws
of
from
the
same
authority
melody
the
ancients
understood
the
succession
of
simple
sounds
according
to
the
laws
of
rhythm
and
metre
or
in
other
words
according
to
time
measure
or
cadence
whereas
the
moderns
understand
by
the
same
term
what
the
ancients
meant
by
harmony
rhythm
and
metre
being
the
modern
air
is
what
the
ancients
understood
by
hence
from
the
preceding
definitions
it
appears
that
what
is
now
called
harmony
was
unknown
to
the
ancients
and
they
viewed
that
term
as
we
now
see
simple
melody
when
we
speak
of
it
as
a
thing
distinguished
from
simple
modulated
air
and
that
their
term
melody
was
applied
to
what
we
now
call
air
or
song
should
this
be
true
the
difficulty
and
that
train
of
endless
disputes
which
has
existed
among
the
learned
and
scientific
world
so
long
will
instantly
vanish
should
we
suppose
an
ancient
used
an
improper
tone
or
or
had
he
transgressed
the
mode
or
key
in
which
he
was
playing
he
committed
an
error
in
harmony
yet
his
melody
might
have
been
perfect
with
respect
to
the
laws
of
rhythm
or
metre
we
should
say
of
a
modern
musician
under
similar
circumstances
that
he
played
wrong
notes
or
was
out
of
tune
yet
kept
his
whoever
made
such
a
distinction
would
be
allowed
to
possess
a
good
ear
for
music
though
the
moderns
would
be
inclined
to
call
it
an
ear
for
melody
or
intonation
by
the
rules
of
musical
conversation
we
should
be
justified
when
we
call
an
instrument
out
of
tune
inharmonious
although
the
intervals
were
nearly
right
by
the
greeks
implied
nothing
more
than
that
proportion
of
sound
to
sound
which
mathematicians
call
or
which
would
be
understood
in
general
musical
conversation
by
an
agreeable
succession
of
musical
notes
as
ancient
harmony
consisted
of
the
succession
of
simple
sounds
so
does
modern
harmony
consist
of
the
succession
of
chords
whether
the
scale
be
the
effect
of
nature
or
produced
by
art
has
occasioned
disputation
between
many
but
without
losing
time
or
space
we
are
we
think
authorised
from
general
opinion
to
observe
that
compositions
formed
on
it
and
on
the
plan
recommended
by
a
lute
organist
would
produce
sensations
odiously
disgusting
to
any
musical
ear
the
diatonic
is
the
most
simple
genera
in
music
consisting
of
tones
and
major
in
the
scale
of
which
genus
the
smallest
interval
is
a
conjoint
degree
which
changes
its
name
and
place
that
is
passing
from
one
to
another
a
prominent
air
in
this
species
of
modern
music
is
save
the
queen
entirely
diatonic
without
modulation
by
the
intervention
of
a
single
flat
or
sharp
it
may
not
be
unacceptable
to
our
readers
to
add
a
few
particulars
of
one
of
the
greatest
composers
that
ever
existed
we
allude
to
the
eminently
illustrious
george
frederick
handel
a
name
dear
to
science
and
entitled
to
the
grateful
veneration
of
every
amateur
in
this
divine
art
he
was
born
at
halle
in
upper
saxony
on
the
of
february
scarcely
was
he
able
to
speak
before
he
articulated
musical
sounds
his
father
was
a
professor
of
the
healing
art
as
a
surgeon
and
physician
then
upwards
of
sixty
who
intended
his
son
for
the
study
of
the
law
grieved
at
the
predeliction
he
banished
all
musical
instruments
from
his
house
but
the
spark
which
nature
had
kindled
in
his
bosom
was
not
to
be
extinguished
by
the
mistaken
views
of
a

by
some
means
or
other
contrived
to
get
a
little
claverchord
into
a
garret
where
applying
himself
after
the
family
had
retired
to
rest
he
discovered
means
to
produce
both
melody
and
harmony
before
he
was
seven
years
of
age
the
duke
of
weissenfells
by
accident
discovered
his
genius
and
prevailed
on
his
father
to
cherish
his
inclination
he
was
accordingly
placed
with
zachan
organist
of
the
cathedral
of
halle
when
from
nine
to
twelve
years
of
age
he
composed
a
church
service
every
week
losing
his
father
whilst
he
was
in
that
city
he
thought
he
could
best
support
his
mother
by
repairing
to
hamburgh
where
he
soon
attracted
general
notice
this
wonder
of
the
age
was
then
only
fourteen
when
he
composed
his
first
opera
having
quitted
hamburgh
he
travelled
for
six
years
in
italy
where
at
both
florence
and
rome
he
excited
much
attention
at
both
which
places
he
produced
new
operatic
performances
in
that
clime
of
the
harmonious
muse
he
was
introduced
to
and
cultivated
the
friendship
of
dominico
scarlatti
gaspurini
and
zotti
with
other
eminent
scientific
characters
he
was
particularly
caressed
and
patronised
by
cardinal
ottoboni
in
whose
circle
he
became
acquainted
with
the
elegant
and
natural
corelli
it
was
here
he
composed
the
sonata
trionfo
del
tempo
the
original
score
of
which
is
now
in
the
royal
collection
after
which
he
went
to
naples
where
he
set
et
galatea
in
italian
to
music
returning
to
germany
he
was
patronised
by
the
elector
of
hanover
subsequently
george
the
first
in
he
visited
london
by
permission
of
his
patron
who
had
settled
a
pension
of
per
annum
on
him
in
london
he
produced
the
opera
of
universally
admired
equal
with
all
his
other
productions
that
had
preceded
he
was
compelled
to
leave
however
reluctantly
the
british
shore
consistent
with
his
engagement
to
his
patron
the
elector
he
departed
not
without
exciting
general
regret
two
years
after
his
first
arrival
in
this
country
he
soon
appeared
here
again
however
and
his
return
was
welcomed
like
the
rising
of
the
genial
orb
of
day
before
the
wrapt
ignicolist
but
now
seduced
by
the
favour
which
awaited
him
he
forgot
to
return
on
the
death
of
queen
anne
who
had
also
settled
an
annual
pension
of
upon
him
equal
to
what
he
received
from
the
elector
his
former
patron
when
that
prince
ascended
the
throne
handel
was
afraid
to
appear
before
his
majesty
till
by
an
ingenious
contrivance
of
baron
kilmarfyge
he
was
restored
to
favour
queen
bounty
being
doubled
by
the
king
and
the
chief
nobility
accepted
an
academy
of
music
under
direction
which
flourished
for
ten
years
till
an
unfortunate
quarrel
occurred
between
him
and
senesino
which
dissolved
the
institution
and
brought
on
a
contest
ruinous
to
the
fortune
and
the
health
of
our
musician
he
was
particularly
patronised
by
the
earl
of
burlington
the
duke
of
chandos
and
most
of
the
distinguished
nobility
of
great
britain
having
restored
his
health
at
the
baths
of
he
for
the
future
chose
sacred
subjects
which
were
performed
at
his
theatre
in
inn
fields
covent
garden
and
westminster
abbey
he
died
in
april
aged
and
was
buried
in
westminster
abbey
where
he
was
honoured
with
a
public
funeral
six
peers
supporting
the
pall
the
very
reverend
and
truly
learned
translator
of
pearce
the
dean
and
then
bishop
of
rochester
performed
the
funeral
service
with
a
full
choir
he
had
been
a
great
benefactor
to
numerous
public
charities
the
funds
of
the
foundling
hospital
were
improved
through
him
with
the
amazing
sum
of
the
organ
in
its
chapel
and
the
score
of
his
were
a
present
and
a
donation
to
the
foundation
from
him
he
left
an
amiable
private
as
well
as
a
good
public
character
behind
him
his
character
as
a
composer
is
too
well
appreciated
by
the
british
public
to
require
any
remarks
from
our
feeble
and
inharmonious
pen
seals
besides
metals
five
other
mediums
are
enumerated
by
ancient
writers
wherewith
letters
and
public
acts
were
sealed
cement
paste
common
wax
and
that
the
terra
sigillaris
was
used
by
the
egyptians
we
have
the
evidence
of
herodotus
and
which
by
inference
is
strengthened
by
that
of
moses
who
speaks
of
or
signets
whence
we
may
safely
infer
that
they
had
a
medium
of
some
sort
wherewith
they
sealed
this
herodotus
supplies
affirming
it
in
direct
terms
and
assigning
a
name
to
the
substance
they
used
for
that
purpose
this
circumstance
was
only
rendered
questionable
by
pliny
who
alleges
the
egyptians
did
not
use
those
things
herodotus
thus
expresses
himself
egyptian
priest
bound
to
the
horns
of
cattle
fit
for
sacrifice
pieces
of
papyrus
with
on
which
they
made
an
impression
with
the
seal
and
such
cattle
could
only
be
offered
up
as
lucian
speaks
of
a
who
ordered
those
who
came
to
consult
him
to
write
down
on
a
bit
of
paper
the
questions
they
wished
to
ask
to
fold
it
up
and
seal
it
with
clay
or
any
other
substance
of
a
like
kind
such
earth
appears
to
have
been
employed
in
sealing
by
the
byzantyne
emperors
for
we
are
told
that
at
the
second
nicene
council
image
worship
was
defended
by
one
saying
one
believed
that
those
who
received
written
orders
from
the
emperor
and
venerated
the
seal
worshipped
on
that
account
the
the
paper
or
the
cicero
relates
that
verres
having
seen
in
the
hands
of
his
servants
a
letter
written
to
his
son
from
agrimentum
and
observing
on
it
an
impression
in
he
was
so
pleased
with
it
that
he
caused
the
with
which
it
was
made
to
be
taken
from
the
possessor
also
the
same
orator
in
his
defence
of
flaccus
produced
an
attestation
sent
from
asia
and
proved
its
authenticity
by
its
being
sealed
with
asiatic
with
which
he
told
the
judges
all
public
and
private
letters
in
asia
were
sealed
and
he
showed
on
the
other
hand
that
the
testimony
brought
by
the
accuser
was
false
because
it
was
sealed
with
and
for
that
reason
could
not
have
come
from
asia
the
scholiast
servius
relates
that
a
sybil
received
a
promise
from
apollo
that
she
should
live
as
long
as
she
did
not
see
the
earth
of
the
island
of
the
erythræa
where
she
resided
that
she
therefore
quitted
the
place
and
retired
to
cumae
where
she
became
old
and
decrepid
but
that
having
received
a
letter
sealed
with
erythræn
earth
when
she
saw
the
seal
she
instantly
expired
no
one
however
will
suppose
that
this
earth
was
used
without
preparation
as
was
that
to
which
is
given
the
name
of
chalk
for
if
it
was
of
a
natural
kind
it
must
have
been
of
that
kind
called
as
that
clay
is
susceptible
of
receiving
an
impression
and
of
retaining
it
subsequent
to
hardening
by
drying
it
is
believed
that
the
romans
under
the
indefinite
term
often
understood
to
be
a
kind
of
earth
which
can
be
proved
by
many
passages
in
their
numerous
writers
columella
speaks
of
a
species
of
chalk
of
which
and
dishes
were
made
of
which
kind
it
is
conjectured
virgil
speaks
when
he
calls
it
adhesive
the
ancient
writers
on
agriculture
give
precisely
the
same
name
to
marl
which
was
employed
to
manure
land
now
both
chalk
and
marl
in
their
natural
state
are
extremely
inapplicable
to
the
purpose
for
which
we
are
led
to
believe
the
was
used
therefore
admitting
the
roman
was
composed
of
them
those
substances
must
naturally
have
undergone
some
laborious
process
in
order
to
render
them
proper
for
the
purpose
to
which
they
were
applied
notwithstanding
none
can
feel
a
higher
respect
for
professor
beckmann
to
whom
we
are
indebted
for
many
of
the
preceding
observations
than
we
do
yet
strongly
as
we
are
influenced
with
this
impression
we
can
not
help
observing
consistent
with
that
duty
we
owe
to
the
public
that
we
can
not
divest
ourselves
of
the
opinion
that
he
is
only
trifling
with
the
public
feeling
perhaps
for
the
ostentatious
display
of
his
own
learning
so
many
objections
of
so
little
weight
are
raised
that
he
really
appears
to
write
for
the
purpose
of
raising
new
objections
to
passages
which
in
our
comprehension
are
extremely
simple
we
can
not
help
applying
to
him
a
passage
which
occurs
in
a
song
of
the
swan
of
twickenham
who
sings
his
pen
then
dashed
it
on
the
ground
striking
from
thought
to
thought
a
vast
profound
plunged
for
the
sense
but
found
no
bottom
there
yet
wrote
and
floundered
on
in
mere
we
would
not
be
illiberal
or
capricious
nor
do
we
presume
to
any
extra
portion
of
intelligence
yet
we
think
we
can
in
a
few
words
discuss
the
topic
and
perhaps
satisfactorily
on
which
he
has
employed
so
many
pages
those
terms
which
have
troubled
the
professor
with
learned
difficulties
really
appear
to
us
susceptible
of
an
easy
interpretation
and
applicable
to
both
or
either
of
the
senses
in
which
they
are
used
as
are
any
words
in
the
language
of
ancient
rome
accordingly
we
find
the
term
implies
either
chalk
clay
loam
white
paint
or
asiatic
earth
termed
creta
asiatica
and
in
brief
it
appears
a
mere
generic
name
for
any
kind
of
earth
raised
from
below
the
surface
of
the
soil
this
is
its
true
sense
but
there
can
not
be
a
question
from
what
is
known
of
the
preparation
of
clay
and
earth
for
and
other
plastic
purposes
which
undergo
a
variety
of
washings
kneadings
that
similar
preparations
were
requisite
in
order
to
bring
it
to
so
curious
so
delicate
a
purpose
as
that
to
which
the
terra
sagillaris
was
applied
and
in
the
sense
used
by
varre
admits
of
nearly
a
similar
description
it
appearing
as
a
pronomen
for
the
same
thing
and
indicates
either
peat
marl
loam
chalk
or
any
earthy
substance
which
may
be
raised
from
below
the
terrestrial
surface
we
have
evidence
every
day
in
our
fruit
shops
that
in
certain
countries
this
kind
of
earth
is
yet
employed
for
closing
up
jars
of
dried
fruits
brought
from
oporto
smyrna
and
other
countries
as
these
appear
to
be
composed
of
white
chalk
of
a
texture
somewhat
similar
to
common
mortar
the
warmth
of
the
atmosphere
where
it
is
used
soon
hardens
and
prevents
the
passage
of
air
to
the
contents
the
jars
themselves
being
oftentimes
only
dried
in
the
sun
thus
it
appears
that
prepared
earths
were
first
used
for
the
purpose
of
sealing
their
adhesive
or
as
virgil
has
it
their
tenacious
qualities
being
wonderfully
improved
for
manual
labour
next
paste
was
employed
prepared
from
dough
to
paste
succeeded
common
wax
sometimes
slightly
tinctured
with
a
green
tint
the
effect
of
endeavouring
to
give
it
a
blue
colour
as
vegetable
blues
turn
green
by
the
process
of
heat
employed
in
melting
whilst
mineral
or
earthy
blues
all
sink
to
the
bottom
from
superior
gravity
this
was
the
material
employed
in
sealing
public
acts
in
england
as
early
as
the
fifteenth
century
we
have
an
anecdote
of
the
duke
of
lancaster
having
no
seal
to
ratify
a
deed
between
him
and
the
duke
of
burgoyne
but
from
what
appears
in
the
attestation
which
with
the
instrument
itself
according
to
the
general
custom
of
the
day
runs
in
rhyme
thus
john
of
gaunt
doe
gyve
and
do
graunt
to
john
of
burgoyne
and
the
heire
of
his
loyne
sutton
and
putton
untill
the
the
attestation
runs
thus
being
no
seal
within
the
roof
in
sooth
i
seal
it
wyth
my
a
good
example
is
this
of
the
simple
brevity
of
the
time
and
a
severe
lecture
upon
the
eternal
repetitions
of
our
modern
lawyers
whereby
the
limitations
and
special
uses
of
deeds
are
made
perhaps
not
according
to
the
necessities
of
the
case
but
are
lengthened
from
selfish
purposes
the
great
charter
which
gives
an
assurance
of
the
rights
of
englishmen
is
sealed
with
white
wax
as
may
be
seen
in
the
british
museum
the
first
arms
used
as
a
seal
in
england
were
those
of
the
tyrannical
subjugator
of
english
rights
william
commonly
called
the
conqueror
and
they
were
brought
from
normandy
although
fenn
in
his
collection
of
original
letters
of
the
last
half
of
the
fifteenth
century
published
in
london
has
given
the
size
and
shape
of
the
seals
he
does
not
apprise
us
of
what
substance
they
were
composed
respecting
a
letter
of
he
says
only
that
seal
is
of
red
wax
by
which
it
is
presumed
he
means
common
wax
and
though
perhaps
not
equal
in
quality
to
such
as
is
now
used
yet
it
was
made
of
nearly
similar
materials
tavernier
in
his
travels
says
that
in
surat
is
melted
and
formed
into
sticks
like
wecker
also
gives
directions
to
make
an
impression
with
calcined
gypsum
and
a
solution
of
gum
or
isinglass
porta
likewise
knew
that
this
might
be
done
and
perhaps
to
greater
perfection
with
amalgam
of
quicksilver
among
the
records
of
the
landgrave
of
are
some
letters
of
sealed
with
red
and
black
wax
in
the
family
of
the
rhingrave
philip
francis
von
daun
the
oldest
letter
sealed
with
wax
known
in
germany
is
found
of
the
date
of
august
it
was
written
from
london
by
an
agent
of
that
family
of
the
name
of
gerrard
herman
the
colour
of
the
wax
is
dark
red
and
very
shining
the
oldest
recipe
known
in
germany
for
making
was
found
by
von
murr
in
a
work
by
samuel
zimmerman
citizen
of
augsburg
published
in
the
copy
in
the
library
of

university
of
gottingen
is
signed

the
author
make
hard
called
spanish
wax
with
which
if
letters
be
sealed
they
can
not
be
opened
without
breaking
the
seal
take
beautiful
clear
resin
the
whitest
you
can
procure
and
melt
it
over
a
slow
coal
fire
when
it
is
properly
melted
take
it
from
the
fire
and
for
every
pound
of
resin
add
two
ounces
of
cinnabar
pounded
very
fine
stirring
it
about
then
let
the
whole
cool
or
pour
it
into
cold
water
thus
you
will
have
beautiful
red
you
are
desirous
of
having
black
wax
add
to
it
with
smalt
or
azure
you
may
make
blue
with
white
and
with
orpiment
yellow
instead
of
resin
you
melt
purified
turpentine
in
a
glass
vessel
and
give
it
any
colour
you
choose
you
will
have
a
harder
kind
of
and
not
so
brittle
as
the
it
may
be
remarked
that
in
these
recipes
for
the
fabrication
of
there
is
no
mention
of
which
is
known
at
present
as
a
chief
ingredient
in
the
composition
of
this
article
approaches
very
near
to
the
quality
of
that
known
as
whence
we
may
conclude
that
the
manufacture
of
it
did
not
originally
come
from
the
east
indies
the
most
ancient
mention
of
occurs
in
a
botanical
work
treating
of
the
history
of
aromatics
and

by
garcia
ab
horto
published
at
antwerp
in
where
the
author
speaking
of
says
that
those
sticks
used
for
sealing
letters
are
made
of
it
at
which
time
was
common
among
the
portuguese
and
has
since
been
manufactured
chiefly
in
holland
spiess
principal
keeper
of

says
respecting
the
antiquity
of
in

that
the
most
ancient
use
of

he
has
known
occurs
in
a
letter
written
by
krapf
at

some

bailiff
at

during
the

for
which
it
is
now
applied
can
not
with
certainty
be
ascertained
as
no
record
is
found
of
the
transaction
by
the
common
expedient
of
inference
however
we
certainly
may
conclude
it
was
in
very
remote
ages
for
transcribers
of
mss
upwards
of
one
thousand
years
ago
used
a
substance
somewhat
resembling
it
in
effect
but
perhaps
the
antiquity
of
the
use
of
pencils
can
not
be
so
well
determined
from
diplomatiques
as
their
frequency
might
be
proved
from
mineralogical
writers
the
first
mention
of
this
discovery
occurs
in
the
works
of
gesner
who
in
his
of
fossils
published
in
says
that
the
british
people
had
pencils
for
writing
with
inclosing
a
piece
of
lead
which
he
believed
to
be
an
artificial
composition
and
it
was
called
which
seems
to
import
that
it
was
a
british
production
and
we
should
consider
from
the
name
of
british
antimony
being
given
to
it
that
it
might
have
been
cumberland
about
thirty
years
afterwards
cæsalpinus
gave
a
more
perfect
account
of
it
he
says
it
was
a
shining
stone
as
smooth
as
glass
and
appeared
as
if
rubbed
over
with
oil
it
gave
to
the
fingers
an
tint
with
a
plumbeous
brightness
and
he
adds
pointed
pencils
were
made
of
it
for
the
use
of
painters
and
draughtsmen
a
closer
description
of
the
substance
than
this
can
not
be
discovered
somewhere
about
three
years
afterwards
a
still
more
perfect
description
was
furnished
by
imperatis
who
says
is
much
more
convenient
for
drawing
than
pen
and
ink
because
the
marks
made
with
it
appear
distinct
upon
a
white
ground
also
in
consequence
of
its
brightness
show
themselves
on
black
and
can
be
preserved
or
rubbed
out
at
pleasure
this
mineral
is
smooth
appears
greasy
to
the
touch
and
has
a
which
it
communicates
with
a
metallic
brightness
it
can
resist
for
a
long
time
the
strongest
fire
and
even
from
it
requires
more
hardness
it
has
in
consequence
been
thought
to
be
a
species
of
this
in
the
arts
to
which
it
is
applied
is
a
property
which
greatly
enhanceth
its
value
being
manufactured
into
crucibles
with
clay
these
vessels
are
capable
of
enduring
the
strongest
heat
of
a
chemical
sometimes
this
lead
is
foliaceous
and
may
be
crumbled
into
small
pieces
or
scales
but
frequently
found
denser
and
more
strong
this
latter
is
what
writing
pencils
should
be
made
of
but
the
former
being
more
frequently
found
and
also
coming
from
the
refuse
of
the
workmen
is
too
often
mixed
up
with
some
glutinous
substance
and
there
is
every
reason
to
suppose
it
to
be
enclosed
in
the
groove
in
a
plastic
state
these
pencils
are
commonly
hawked
about
our
streets
by
pedlars
and
jews
of
purchasing
which
people
should
be
cautious
as
they
are
in
general
utterly
worthless
robinson
in
his
essay
towards
a
natural
history
of
westmoreland
and
cumberland
states
that
at
first
the
country
people
round
keswick
marked
their
sheep
with
afterwards
they
discovered
the
art
of
employing
it
in
their
earthenware
and
also
to
preserve
iron
from
rust
the
same
writer
says
the
dutch
use
it
in
dyeing
to
render
black
more
durable
and
that
they
buy
it
in
large
quantities
for
that
purpose
but
their
application
of
it
for
dyeing
we
should
consider
as
highly
questionable
the
mode
of
eradicating
by
means
of
an
elastic
gum
called
caoutchouc
or
was
we
have
been
informed
first
discovered
in
england
somewhere
about
sixty
years
ago
coloured
glass
the
manufacture
of
glass
we
find
was
quite
common
in
ethiopia
syria
assyria
and
other
eastern
countries
in
the
earliest
ages
of
the
world
as
diodorus
siculus
informs
us
who
says
the
ethiopians
enclosed
in
glass
the
bodies
of
their
parents
and
friends
we
doubt
however
that
on
this
point
the
historian
was
deceived
but
it
really
appears
probable
that
soon
after
the
art
of
making
glass
was
discovered
the
idea
of
communicating
to
it
some
colours
would
easily
present
itself
this
probability
appears
increased
when
it
is
recollected
that
much
care
is
requisite
to
render
glass
perfectly
colourless
as
the
various
metallic
particles
with
which
stone
and
sand
abound
these
being
the
chief
ingredients
of
which
glass
is
composed
and
which
gradually
give
tints
in
fusion
will
almost
unavoidably
communicate
some
hue
or
other
therefore
the
perfection
of
glass
is
to
have
it
perfectly
colourless
but
with
respect
to
coloured
glass
so
frequently
have
people
been
imposed
upon
by
having
coloured
glass
sold
to
them
for
valuable
stones
that
some
conscientious
authors
have
very
laudably
and
carefully
abstained
from
lending
the
benefit
of
instruction
in
its
manufacture
by
publishing
the
method
the
egyptian
artists
were
so
famous
in
the
manufacture
of
glass
that
the
romans
were
content
to
receive
this
article
from
the
in
alexandria
and
did
not
interfere
in
endeavouring
to
procure
the
art
themselves
until
the
latter
part
of
the
empire
we
read
that
an
egyptian
priest
made
a
present
to
the
emperor
adrian
of
several
beautiful
glass
cups
which
sparkled
with
many
colours
and
such
value
did
that
august
personage
place
upon
these
toys
that
he
ordered
them
to
be
used
only
on
high
feasts
and
solemnities
strabo
relates
that
a
glass
manufacturer
of
alexandria
informed
him
that
an
earth
was
found
in
egypt
without
which
the
valuable
coloured
glass
could
not
be
made
it
has
been
thought
by
some
the
glass
earth
here
meant
was
a
mineral
alkali
which
was
readily
found
in
egypt
serving
to
make
glass
but
this
author
speaking
expressly
of
coloured
glass
it
has
been
suggested
as
probable
the
alkali
above
named
could
not
have
reference
to
what
the
artisan
intended
to
imply
but
that
it
must
be
referred
to
some
metallic
earth
or
manganese
one
democritus
is
named
by
seneca
as
having
discovered
an
art
of
making
artificial
emeralds
but
it
has
been
conjectured
that
what
the
philosopher
meant
was
the
art
of
communicating
colour
to
natural
rock
crystal
or
colouring
glass
already
made
so
as
to
resemble
stones
which
is
a
process
performed
by
cementation
directions
have
been
furnished
for
this
purpose
by
porta
neri
and
others
but
it
is
discovered
that
the
articles
so
coloured
are
liable
to
such
accidents
in
the
process
that
it
is
next
to
impossible
to
render
things
of
any
size
tolerably
perfect
so
as
to
bear
cutting
afterwards
in
the
museum
victorium
at
rome
there
are
shown
a
chrysolite
and
an
emerald
both
perfectly
well
executed
and
thoroughly
transparent
without
a
blemish
we
have
not
from
the
ancients
an
account
of
what
process
they
employed
but
it
must
be
evident
that
nothing
less
than
metallic
calces
could
have
been
used
and
for
this
evident
reason
that
any
other
substance
could
not
have
resisted
the
influence
of
the
necessary
heat
the
last
century
has
however
produced
certain
artists
in
northern
european
nations
who
have
adopted
a
method
of
employing
the
precious
metals
to
communicate
a
tincture
to
glass
in
the
process
of
making
where
iron
were
originally
only
used
and
their
endeavours
have
been
attended
with
singular
success
by
means
of
an
amalgam
of
gold
or
a
solution
in
and
precipitated
with
a
solution
of
tin
the
metal
then
assuming
the
appearance
of
a
rich
purple
coloured
powder
so
prepared
it
is
mixed
with
the
best
and
then
called
the
precipitate
or
gold
calx
of
cassius
the
inventor
of
gold
purple
or
mineral
purple
this
precipitate
communicates
a
rich
ruby
coloured
purple
so
perfect
that
it
is
impossible
to
discover
the
deception
without
the
substances
be
tried
by
the
usual
means
cut
with
a
diamond
or
a
prepared
file
we
have
had
in
england
some
very
eminent
artists
in
the
practice
of
staining
glass
and
also
for
making
artificial
representations
of
various
precious
stones
although
the
professed
object
of
alchemy
has
now
met
with
that
contempt
it
merited
because
notwithstanding
the
immense
sums
which
have
been
expended
the
time
lost
and
unprofitable
labour
employed
in
the
unavailing
search
after
what
probably
never
will
be
found
yet
the
labour
lost
and
money
expended
has
not
been
totally
useless
since
it
has
served
to
open
the
seals
which
secured
chemical
science
to
the
modern
world
and
which
is
the
chief
if
not
the
sole
advantage
it
can
claim
over
antiquity
for
superiority
of
information
painting
on
glass
but
perhaps
staining
had
been
a
more
appropriate
expression
or
properly
speaking
in
enamel
with
the
preparations
for
colouring
in
mosaic
work
may
to
a
certain
extent
be
justly
considered
as
branches
of
the
art
of
colouring
glass
in
all
which
there
is
no
colour
more
difficult
to
be
attained
than
a
beautiful
red
it
now
is
and
ever
has
been
most
difficult
consequently
the
dearest
colour
the
presumed
ignorance
of
ancient
artists
in
preparing
this
colour
has
afforded
some
reason
it
is
said
to
suppose
the
ancients
knew
of
no
other
substance
proper
for
that
purpose
but
calx
of
iron
or
manganese
to
this
we
may
reply
many
specimens
are
found
which
show
they
were
not
so
ignorant
in
that
art
and
that
it
is
more
than
probable
the
same
jealousy
which
is
found
to
exist
in
modern
days
among
artizans
might
prevent
our
sagacious
predecessors
from
publishing
the
secrets
of
their
respective
professions
to
the
world
we
contend
that
as
the
materials
must
then
have
had
existence
which
have
been
since
so
successfully
employed
pray
what
was
the
reason
the
ancients
should
not
avail
themselves
of
their
benefit
in
all
the
higher
speculations
of
science
and
arts
where
the
great
and
superior
energies
of
genius
were
requisite
this
perfection
in
the
ancients
far
surpassed
any
exertions
which
have
been
since
achieved
by
the
moderns
to
instance
one
artist
and
one
art
solely
we
name
the
great
praxiteles
so
famous
in
the
art
of
statuary
whose
works
were
a
model
of
perfection
etching
on
glass
and
glass
cutting
without
entering
into
the
history
of
the
art
we
only
propose
to
speak
of
those
things
which
ancient
and
modern
authors
have
said
upon
the
art
of
engraving
on
glass
observing
that
it
was
an
art
anciently
known
to
both
the
greeks
and
romans
although
it
appears
extremely
probable
that
from
their
expressed
ignorance
of
many
of
those
properties
which
modern
chemistry
has
discovered
to
belong
to
matter
they
were
ignorant
of
the
art
of
etching
on
glass
from
antique
specimens
still
preserved
a
doubt
can
not
for
a
moment
be
suffered
to
exist
on
our
minds
but
that
the
art
of
engraving
upon
glass
was
familiar
to
the
greek
artists
who
formed
upon
glass
both
linear
figures
and
in
relievo
by
the
same
means
as
are
now
employed
for
nearly
the
same
purpose
if
we
can
place
any
confidence
in
an
able
and
learned
lapidary
natter
who
has
established
that
the
ancients
employed
the
same
kind
of
instruments
for
this
purpose
or
nearly
such
as
are
now
in
use
abating
perhaps
the
use
of
diamonds
and
the
dust
of
that
precious
material
for
which
it
is
conceived
they
used
emery
powder
and
the
dust
of
glass
from
what
is
related
by
pliny
it
certainly
appears
that
they
used
the
wheel
an
instrument
moving
in
a
horizontal
direction
over
the
some
have
thought
that
drinking
cups
and
vessels
may
have
been
formed
from
the
glass
whilst
in
a
state
of
fusion
by
means
of
this
wheel
to
this
they
think
those
words
of
martial
refer
where
he
says
having
reference
to
the
boldness
of
the
touch
those
vessels
he
was
constructing
often
broke
under
the
last
touch
he
bestowed
upon
his
transparent
labours
although
perhaps
of
costly
value
these
accidents
must
of
necessity
have
rendered
those
articles
extremely
expensive
there
are
not
wanting
many
who
affirm
the
art
of
with
the
instruments
necessary
for
that
operation
to
be
of
modern
invention
those
assign
it
to
the
ingenuity
of
caspar
lehmann
originally
an
engraver
on
iron
and
steel
and
who
as
beckmann
informs
us
made
an
attempt
which
succeeded
in
cutting
crystal
and
afterwards
glass
in
the
same
manner
this
artist
we
are
told
was
in
the
service
of
rodolphus
the
second
emperor
of
that
name
who
in
the
year
besides
giving
him
valuable
presents
conferred
on
him
the
title
of
lapidary
and
to
his
court
and
gave
him
a
patent
allowing
him
the
exclusive
privilege
of
exercising
this
new
art
he
worked
at
prague
where
he
had
an
assistant
of
the
name
of
zacharias
belzer
but
george
schwanhard
one
of
his
pupils
carried
on
the
business
to
a
much
larger
extent
the
last
named
was
a
son
of
hans
schwanhard
a
joiner
at
rothenburg
and
was
born
in
at
the
age
of
seventeen
he
went
to
prague
to
learn
the
art
of
cutting
glass
from
lehmann
his
good
behaviour
won
so
much
upon
the
affections
of
his
master
that
on
his
death
in
the
year
he
left
him
his
heir
schwanhard
succeeded
in
obtaining
a
continuation
of
the
patent
from
the
emperor
and
removed
to
nuremburg
where
he
wrought
for
many
of
the
nobility
of
that
district
this
was
we
believe
the
occasion
of
that
city
claiming
the
honour
of
being
the
of
this
new
art
in
the
year
he
worked
at
prague
and
also
at
ratisbon
by
command
of
the
emperor
ferdinand
iii
and
he
died
in
he
left
two
sons
who
both
followed
the
lucrative
employment
of
their
father
afterwards
nuremburg
produced
many
expert
masters
in
the
art
who
from
the
improvement
in
the
tools
and
also
from
discovering
more
economical
modes
of
using
them
were
enabled
to
execute
the
orders
of
the
public
at
a
more
moderate
rate
than
had
been
previously
charged
for
some
articles
those
latter
masters
likewise
brought
this
art
to
a
much
greater
degree
of
perfection
notwithstanding
zahn
was
of
the
same
country
and
must
have
been
apprised
of
the
facts
previously
stated
yet
he
mentions
it
as
a
very
recent
invention
at
nuremberg
at
the
time
he
published
his
he
also
furnishes
a
plate
giving
at
the
same
time
a
description
of
the
various
instruments
employed
however
that
this
invention
is
not
purely
may
be
perceived
from
those
facts
we
have
already
submitted
it
should
be
stated
that
before
this
latter
artists
used
with
a
diamond
to
cut
figures
upon
glass
in
almost
every
form
as
far
as
the
representation
by
lines
went
the
history
of
diamonds
has
been
presented
to
the
public
by
mawe
in
his
observations
on
the
diamond
districts
of
brazil
it
appears
to
be
yet
undetermined
whether
the
ancients
used
that
stone
for
the
purpose
of
cutting
others
upon
this
point
pliny
appears
to
be
satisfied
that
they
did
solinus
and
isidore
both
express
themselves
in
a
manner
the
reverse
but
although
this
may
leave
us
in
some
doubt
it
appears
pretty
clear
that
they
did
not
attempt
to
cut
that
valuable
production
with
its
own
dust
or
to
give
it
different
faces
or
render
it
more
brilliant
by
the
same
means
if
this
point
was
settled
there
could
be
no
great
difficulty
in
affirming
or
negativing
the
fact
of
their
engraving
upon
that
stone
thus
doubts
appear
to
increase
on
this
head
for
mariette
denies
that
they
did
natter
appears
uncertain
and
klotz
asserts
with
confidence
it
was
certain
his
authority
to
be
sure
has
been
considered
not
to
be
of
much
weight
the
proper
question
however
appears
to
be
whether
the
greeks
and
romans
used
diamonds
for
cutting
and
engraving
other
stones
or
glass
natter
in
his
work
already
noticed
thinks
they
were
employed
on
some
antique
engravings
his
authority
is
deserving
respect
but
if
they
were
employed
on
other
stones
the
authority
which
at
present
directs
us
confidently
alleges
they
did
not
employ
them
in
cutting
glass
but
he
points
out
the
mode
in
which
that
article
was
wont
to
be
divided
in
the
following
terms
used
for
that
purpose
emery
instruments
of
the
hardest
steel
and
a
iron
by
which
they
directed
the
rents
at
their
the
first
mention
which
appears
to
occur
of
the
use
of
the
diamond
for
this
purpose
is
recorded
of
francis
of
france
who
fond
of
the
arts
sciences
and
new
inventions
wrote
a
couple

schwanhard
was
a
professed
adept
in
that
art
and
since
his
time
an
artist
of
the
name
of
john
rost
of
augsburg
cut
some
drinking
glasses
which
were
purchased
by
the
emperor
charles
at
an
extravagant
price
etching
on
glass
an
acid
to
dissolve
siliceous
earth
was
discovered
as
late
as
by
the
celebrated
chemist
scheele
in
it
is
conceived
that
this
can
not
be
of
older
date
than
that
period
but
it
is
alleged
that
an
acid
was
discovered
as
early
as
the
year
by
henry
schwanhard
it
being
said
that
some
aquafortis
had
dropped
by
accident
upon
his
spectacles
the
glass
being
corroded
by
it
he
thence
learned
to
improve
the
liquid
that
he
could
etch
figures
and
write
upon
glass
how
he
prepared
this
liquid
is
a
secret
which
has
not
been
revealed
the
says
on
this
subject
that
he
by
the
acuteness
of
his
genius
proved
that
which
had
been
considered
impossible
could
be
accomplished
and
found
out
a
corrosive
so
powerful
that
the
hardest
crystal
glass
which
had
hitherto
withstood
the
force
of
the
strongest
spirits
was
obliged
to
yield
to
it
as
well
as
metals
and
stones
by
these
means
he
delineated
and
etched
on
glass
figures
of
men
in
various
situations
animals
and
plants
in
a
manner
perfectly
natural
and
brought
them
to
the
highest
perfection
the
glass
proposed
to
be
etched
is
made
perfectly
clean
and
free
from
grease
then
the
figure
is
covered
with
a
varnish
then
an
edge
of
wax
being
raised
round
the
glass
the
acid
is
poured
in
and
the
whole
ground
on
the
exterior
of
the
figures
appears
rough
whilst
the
figure
is
preserved
in
its
original
beauty
of
outline
bright
and
smooth
this
is
the
mode
the
inventor
adopted
professor
beckmann
says
he
mentioned
this
ancient
method
of
etching
upon
glass
to
an
artist
of
the
name
of
klindworth
who
possessed
great
dexterity
in
such
arts
and
requested
him
to
try
it
he
drew
a
tree
with
oil
varnish
and
colours
on
a
plate
of
glass
applied
the
acid
on
the
plate
in
the
usual
manner
after
it
had
been
upon
the
plate
for
a
sufficient
time
poured
off
and
the
plate
afterwards
cleaned
of
the
varnish
a
beautiful
tree
was
left
bright
and
smooth
with
a
rough
it
is
conceived
that
many
great
improvements
may
yet
be
made
in
this
process
it
appears
that
no
other
acid
than
that
produced
by
the
sparry
fluor
is
capable
of
corroding
every
kind
of
glass
though
baume
in
his
experimentale
says
that
many
kinds
of
glass
may
be
corroded
by
the
marine
and
vitriolic
acids
in
this
state
of
uncertainty
was
the
public
mind
till
the
year
when
it
was
thought
that
a
recipe
older
than
that
previously
mentioned
might
possibly
be
discovered
accordingly
in
that
year
in
the
month
of
january
the
following
is
said
to
have
been
transmitted
to
the
publisher
of
the
encyclopedie
by
john
george
weygand
of
goldingen
which
is
reported
to
have
belonged
to
matthew
pauli
of
dresden
then
deceased
with
which
the
last
named
gentleman
had
etched
on
glass
arms
landscapes
and
figures
of
various
kinds
we
find
that
in
it
very
strong
acid
of
nitre
was
used
which
entirely
disengages
the
acid
of
sparry
fluor
though
the
vitriolic
acid
has
been
commonly
employed
and
figures
thus
produced
will
appear
as
if
raised
above
the
plane
of
the
glass
this
sparry
fluor
is
found
abundantly
in
derbyshire
as
well
as
in
the
mines
of
germany
theophrastus
is
the
first
who
notices
the
effect
of
sparry
fluor
by
observing
that
there
are
certain
stones
which
when
added
to
silver
copper
and
iron
ores
become
fluid
it
appears
that
cronstedt
was
the
first
systematic
writer
who
gave
it
a
name
when
nitri
per
has
passed
into
the
recipient
ply
it
with
a
strong
fire
and
when
well
dephlegmated
pour
it
as
it
corrodes
ordinary
glass
into
a
waldenburg
flask
then
throw
into
it
a
pulverised
green
bohemian
emerald
otherwise
called
which
when
reduced
to
powder
and
heated
emits
in
the
dark
a
green
light
and
place
it
in
warm
sand
for
hours
take
a
piece
of
glass
well
cleaned
and
freed
from
all
grease
by
means
of
a
ley
put
a
border
of
wax
round
it
about
an
inch
in
height
and
cover
it
equally
all
over
with
the
above
acid
the
longer
you
let
it
stand
so
much
the
better
and
at
the
end
of
some
time
the
glass
will
be
corroded
and
the
figures
which
have
been
traced
out
with
sulphur
and
oil
varnish
will
appear
as
if
raised
above
the
plane
of
the
glass
hydrometers
the
hydrometer
is
an
instrument
for
admeasuring
liquids
by
it
the
strength
or
specific
gravity
of
different
fluids
is
discovered
by
the
depth
to
which
it
sinks
in
them
it
has
been
chiefly
used
for
discovering
the
contents
of
different
salt
waters
without
analysis
and
is
now
almost
entirely
used
by
persons
connected
with
the
to
ascertain
the
different
degrees
of
strength
and
what
alloy
they
will
bear
hence
its
utility
to
the
manufacturer
and
the
is
apparent
the
laws
respecting
the
comparative
weight
of
different
fluids
as
well
as
of
solid
bodies
immersed
in
them
was
first
discovered
by
that
great
geometrician
archimedes
it
may
be
far
from
improbable
that
archimedes
constructed
that
instrument
himself
and
if
it
should
appear
that
he
did
it
must
have
happened
two
hundred
and
twelve
years
before
the
christian
era
the
most
ancient
mention
of
this
instrument
by
its
specific
name
occurs
in
the
fifth
century
of
our
era
upon
the
following
occasion
the
anecdote
is
very
singular
and
affecting
and
also
evinces
the
incapacity
of
humanity
to
act
consistent
and
as
it
ought
when
we
suffer
ourselves
to
be
directed
by
passions
unworthy
of
the
human
character
it
is
first
discovered
in
those
letters
of
synesius
to
the
philosophic
and
beautiful
hypatia
we
trust
we
may
be
excused
the
liberty
we
propose
to
take
in
detailing
this
circumstance
which
is
comparatively
little
known
and
as
its
interest
also
recommends
it
this
furnishes
an
additional
motive
hypatia
was
the
daughter
of
theon
an
eminent
mathematician
of
alexandria
some
of
whose
writings
are
still
extant
by
her
father
she
was
instructed
in
the
mathematics
and
from
other
great
men
who
at
that
period
abounded
in
alexandria
she
learned
the
platonic
and
aristotelian
philosophy
and
acquired
such
a
knowledge
of
these
sciences
that
she
taught
them
publicly
with
the
greatest
applause
she
was
young
and
beautiful
had
a
personable
figure
was
sprightly
and
agreeable
in
conversation
though
at
the
same
time
modest
and
she
possessed
the
most
rigid
virtue
which
was
proof
against
every
temptation
she
conducted
herself
with
so
much
propriety
towards
her
lovers
that
they
never
could
obtain
more
than
the
pleasure
of
her
company
and
hearing
her
discourse
and
with
this
which
they
considered
as
an
honour
they
were
contented
those
who
were
so
daring
as
to
desire
further
communion
she
dismissed
and
even
destroyed
the
appetite
of
one
of
her
admirers
who
would
not
suffer
her
to
philosophise
by
means
of
some
strong
preparation
which
others
appear
not
to
have
since
imitated
she
suffered
so
cruel
a
death
that
had
she
been
a
christian
and
suffered
from
pagan
error
her
name
would
have
been
ranked
among
its
most
honoured
victims
in
the
list
of
martyrology
but
being
a
pagan
and
suffering
from
the
persecution
of
superstitious
and
zeal
she
is
honoured
among
the
foremost
of
martyrs
to
celestial
philosophy
the
name
of
the
christian
patriarch
at
that
period
in
alexandria
was
cyrill
whose
family
had
for
upwards
of
a
hundred
years
before
his
time
produced
bishops
who
had
been
much
more
serviceable
to
their
own
family
connections
than
they
had
ever
been
towards
the
propagation
of
the
christian
faith
the
present
was
proud
litigious
and
revengeful
vindictive
and
intolerant
to
the
last
degree
his
ignorance
debasing
his
own
character
as
a
man
and
scandalising
the
religion
of
which
he
was
so
unworthy
a
minister
he
stupidly
conceived
himself
sanctioned
in
everything
which
his
foolish
and
mistaken
ideas
might
dictate
to
be
for
the
glory
of
god
and
acted
as
a
persecutor
prosecutor
judge
and
executioner
he
had
condemned
nestorias
without
hearing
his
defence
as
the
city
of
alexandria
was
then
very
flourishing
on
account
of
its
extended
commerce
the
emperor
had
there
allowed
greater
toleration
and
more
peculiar
privileges
to
all
religions
than
in
any
other
place
it
consequently
contained
among
others
a
great
number
of
jews
who
carried
on
a
most
extensive
trade
as
well
as
a
great
many
pagan
families
in
the
eyes
of
the
bigot
cyrill
this
was
wrong
he
would
have
the
clean
and
the
jews
must
be
banished
the
governor
however
who
was
a
man
of
prudence
and
sober
discretion
much
better
acquainted
with
the
real
interests
of
the
city
opposed
a
measure
he
saw
replete
with
mischief
and
even
caused
to
be
condemned
to
death
a
christian
profligate
who
had
injured
the
jews
this
malefactor
was
by
the
express
order
of
cyrill
buried
in
the
church
as
a
martyr
and
he
collected
an
army
of
five
hundred
lazy
monks
who
abused
the
governor
in
the
public
streets
and
excited
an
insurrection
among
the
people
against
the
jews
so
that
the
debased
race
of
abraham
was
expelled
from
the
city
where
they
had
so
long
existed
unmolested
from
the
time
of
alexander
the
great
cyrill
one
day
whilst
looking
for
objects
of
persecution
saw
a
number
of
carriages
attended
with
servants
belonging
to
the
first
families
in
the
city
before
a
certain
house
inquiring
what
was
the
cause
of
the
assembly
he
was
informed
that
it
was
the
habitation
of
the
lovely
hypatia
who
on
account
of
her
extensive
learning
and
very
eminent
talents
was
visited
by
people
of
the
first
respectability
this
afforded
to
the
malignant
priest
a
sufficient
object
for
the
exercise
of
his
jealousy
against
the
meritorious
the
unoffending
the
beautiful
hypatia
he
from
that
moment
resolved
upon
her
destruction
accordingly
he
lost
no
time
in
exciting
his
myrmidons
the
monks
and
priests
those
who
should
have
been
the
ministers
of
that
religion
which
they
professed
to
teach
to
destroy
the
fair
philosopher
they
accordingly
with
diabolical
rage
and
instigated
by
infernal
cruelty
took
the
earliest
opportunity
to
seize
her
hurried
her
to
the
church
the
temple
of
peace
and
which
they
violated
by
an
offence
at
which
humanity
must
shudder
having
torn
the
clothes
from
her
delicate
form
they
tore
the
flesh
from
her
bones
with
potsherds
then
dragged
her
mangled
body
about
the
city
and
afterwards
burnt
it
this
demoniacal
tragedy
took
place
in
the
year
and
was
perpetrated
by
the
professed
servants
of
him
who
came
into
world
to
save
those
which
were
lost
to
preach
peace
and
to
all
men
the
impressions
which
such
an
event
made
upon
people
of
every
persuasion
may
be
conceived
they
admit
not
of
description
from
a
feeble
pen
but
we
may
ask
the
question
was
it
such
a
transaction
as
was
calculated
to
make
converts
to
the
doctrines
of
christianity
whose
avowed
motive
and
maxim
is
in
the
words
of
milton
winning
words
to
conquer
willing
hearts
and
make
persuasion
do
the
work
of
all
historians
are
not
agreed
in
some
circumstances
of
the
preceding
relation
but
they
generally
unite
in
bestowing
praise
upon
hypatia
whose
memory
was
long
honoured
by
her
grateful
and
affectionate
scholars
among
whom
was
synesius
of
a
noble
pagan
family
who
had
cultivated
philosophy
and
the
mathematics
with
the
utmost
ardour
and
who
had
been
one
of
her
most
intimate
friends
and
followers
on
account
of
his
learning
and
virtues
many
eminent
talents
and
open
disposition
the
inhabitants
of
ptolemais
were
desirous
he
should
be
bishop
having
been
previously
employed
on
many
public
and
important
concerns
with
success
after
modestly
desiring
for
a
long
period
that
they
would
fix
their
choice
upon
a
more
worthy
object
they
still
persisting
he
assented
upon
condition
that
he
was
not
to
believe
in
the
resurrection
to
which
he
could
not
at
that
time
bring
his
internal
conviction
he
suffered
himself
to
be
baptised
and
became
their
bishop
he
was
confirmed
by
the
orthodox
patriarch
theophilus
the
predecessor
of
cyrill
to
whose
jurisdiction
ptolemais
belonged
he
afterwards
renounced
his
error
respecting
the
resurrection
this
learned
man
evinced
his
gratitude
to
hypatia
by
the
honourable
mention
which
he
made
of
her
in
some
of
his
writings
still
preserved
in
his
fifteenth
letter
to
her
he
tells
hypatia
that
he
was
so
unfortunate
or
found
himself
so
ill
that
he
wished
to
use
an
hydroscopium
the
greek
for
hydrometer
and
he
requests
that
she
would
cause
one
to
be
constructed
for
him
he
says
is
a
cylindrical
tube
of
the
size
of
a
reed
or
pipe
a
line
is
drawn
upon
it
lengthways
which
is
intersected
by
others
and
these
point
out
the
weight
of
water
at
the
end
of
the
tube
is
a
cone
the
base
of
which
is
joined
to
that
of
the
tube
so
that
they
have
both
only
one
base
this
part
of
the
instrument
is
called
if
it
be
placed
in
water
it
remains
in
a
perpendicular
direction
so
that
one
can
readily
discover
by
it
the
weight
of
the
petau
who
published
the
works
of
synesius
in
the
year
acknowledges
that
he
did
not
understand
this
passage
an
old
scoliast
he
says
who
had
added
some
illegible
words
thought
it
was
a
but
the
ellepsydra
was
not
immersed
in
water
but
filled
with
it
he
therefore
thought
that
it
might
allude
to
the
chorobates
which
vitruvius
describes
as
an
instrument
employed
in
levelling
but
it
appears
that
synesius
who
complained
of
ill
health
could
have
no
occasion
for
such
an
instrument
besides
no
part
of
that
instrument
he
describes
has
any
resemblance
to
the
one
described
by
synesius
from
the
works
of
fermat
an
excellent
mathematician
and
a
very
learned
man
well
acquainted
with
antiquities
and
the
works
of
the
ancients
we
give
the
following
explanation
concerning
the
hydroscopium
of
archimedes
as
this
article
would
be
incomplete
without
it
is
impossible
says
he
the
could
be
the
level
or
of
vitruvius
for
the
lines
on
the
latter
were
perpendicular
to
the
horizon
whereas
the
lines
on
the
former
were
parallel
to
it
the
hydroscopium
was
undoubtedly
a
hydrometer
of
the
simplest
construction
the
tube
may
be
made
of
copper
and
open
at
the
top
but
at
the
other
end
which
when
used
is
the
lowest
it
must
terminate
with
a
cone
the
base
of
which
is
added
to
that
of
the
tube
lengthwise
along
the
tube
are
drawn
two
lines
which
are
intersected
by
others
and
the
more
numerous
these
divisions
are
the
instrument
will
be
so
much
the
more
when
placed
in
water
it
sinks
to
a
certain
depth
which
will
be
marked
by
the
and
which
will
be
greater
according
to
the
lightness
of
the
a
figure
which
is
added
might
have
been
dispensed
with
when
a
common
friend
of
fermat
and
petau
showed
it
to
the
latter
he
considered
it
to
be
so
just
and
explanatory
of
the
real
meaning
of
synesius
that
he
wished
to
be
allowed
the
opportunity
of
introducing
it
