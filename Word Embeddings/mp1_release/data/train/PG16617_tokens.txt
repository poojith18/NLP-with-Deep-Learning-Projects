with

he
was

of

after

whereto
he
was
addicted

in

booke
was
discoursed
the
troubled
state
of
this
land
by
the
manifold
and
mutinous
inuasions
of
the
danes
who
though
they
sought
to
ingrosse
the
rule
of
euerie
part
and
parcell
therof
into
their
hands
yet
being
resisted
by
the
valiantnesse
of
the
gouernors
supported
with
the
aid
of
their
people
they
were
disappointed
of
their
expectation
and
receiued
manie
a
dishonorable
or
rather
reprochfull
repulse
at
their
aduersaries
hands
much
mischiefe
doubtlesse
they
did
and
more
had
doone
if
they
had
not
bèene
met
withall
in
like
measure
of
extremitie
as
they
offred
to
the
offense
and
ouerthrow
of
great
multitudes
their
first
entrance
into
this
land
is
controuersed
among
writers
some
saieng
that
it
was
in
the
daies
of
king
britricus
other
some
affirming
that
it
was
in
the
time
of
king
egbert
c
about
which
point
sith
it
is
a
matter
of
no
great
moment
we
count
it
labour
lost
to
vse
manie
woords
onelie
this
by
the
waie
is
notewoorthie
that
the
danes
had
an
vnperfect
or
rather
a
lame
and
limping
rule
in
this
land
so
long
as
the
gouernors
were
watchfull
diligent
politike
at
home
and
warlike
abroad
but
when
these
kind
of
kings
discontinued
and
that
the
raines
of
the
regiment
fell
into
the
hands
of
a
pezzant
not
a
puissant
prince
a
man
euill
qualified
dissolute
slacke
and
licentious
not
regarding
the
dignitie
of
his
owne
person
nor
fauoring
the
good
estate
of
the
people
the
danes
who
before
were
coursed
from
coast
to
coast
and
pursued
from
place
to
place
as
more
willing
to
leaue
the
land
than
desirous
to
tarrie
in
the
same
tooke
occasion
of
stomach
and
courage
to
reenter
this
ile
waxing
more
bold
and
confident
more
desperate
and
venturous
spared
no
force
omitted
no
opportunitie
let
slip
no
aduantage
that
they
might
possiblie
take
to
put
in
practise
and
fullie
to
accomplish
their
long
conceiued
purpose
now
bicause
the
danes
in
the
former
kings
daies
were
reencountred
and
that
renowmedlie
so
often
as
they
did
encounter
and
sèeking
the
totall
regiment
were
dispossessed
of
their
partile
principalitie
which
by
warlike
violence
they
obteined
and
for
that
the
saxons
were
interessed
in
the
land
and
these
but
violent
incrochers
vnable
to
kèepe
that
which
they
came
to
by
constreint
we
haue
thought
it
conuenient
to
comprise
the
troubled
estate
of
that
time
in
the
sixt
booke
the
rather
for
the
necessarie
consequence
of
matters
then
in

and
hèere

not

great
and
shamefull
loosenesse

hart
and
courage
to
the
enimie
to
begin
the
seuenth
booke
wherin
is
expressed
the
chiefest
time
of
their
flourishing
estate
in
this
land
if
in
tumults
vprores
battels
and
bloudshed
such
a
kind
of
estate
may
possiblie
be
found
for

heere
they
take
vpon
them
like
souereignes
hèere
if
at
anie
time
they
had
absolute
authoritie
they
did
what
they
might
in
the
highest
degrèe
as
shall
be
declared
in
the
vnfortunate
affaires
of
vngratious
egelred
or
etheldred
the
sonne
of
king
edgar
and
of
his
last
wife
queene
alfred
who
was
ordeined
king
in
place
of
his
brother
edward
after
the
same
edward
was
dispatched
out
of
the
waie
and
began
his
reigne
ouer
this
sidenote
realme
of
england
in
the
yèere
of
our
lord
which
was
in
the
seuenth
yèere
of
the
emperor
otho
the
second
in
the
of
lothaire
of
france
and
about
the
second
or
third
yeere
of
kenneth
the
third
sidenote
of
that
name
king
of
scotland
this
egelred
or
etheldred
was
the
in
number
from
cerdicus
the
first
king
of
the
westsaxons
through
his
negligent
gouernment
the
state
of
the
commonwealth
fell
into
such
decaie
as
writers
doo
report
that
vnder
him
it
may
be
said
how
the
kingdome
was
come
to
the
vttermost
point
or
period
of
old
and
fèeble
age
which
is
the
next
degrèe
to
the
graue
for
wheras
whilest
the
realme
was
diuided
at
the
first
by
the
saxons
into
sundrie
dominions
it
grew
at
length
as
it
were
increasing
from
youthfull
yeeres
to
one
absolute
monarchie
which
passed
vnder
the
late
remembred
princes
egbert
adelstane
edgar
and
others
so
that
in
their
daies
it
might
be
said
how
it
was
growne
to
mans
state
but
now
vnder
this
egelred
through
famine
pestilence
and
warres
the
state
thereof
was
so
shaken
turned
vpside
downe
and
weakened
on
ech
part
that
rightlie
might
the
season
be
likened
vnto
the
old
broken
yèeres
of
mans
life
which
through
fèeblenesse
is
not
able
to
helpe
it
selfe
dunstane
archbishop
of
canturburie
was
thought
to
haue
foresèene
this
thing
and
therfore
refused
to
annoint
egelred
king
which
by
the
murther
of
his
brother
should
atteine
to
the
gouernment
but
at
length
he
was
compelled
vnto
it
and
so
he
consecrated
him
at
kingston
vpon
thames
as
the
maner
then
was
on
the
day
of
aprill
assisted
by
oswald
archbishop
of
yorke
and
ten
other
bishops
sidenote
but
as
hath
bèene
reported
dunstane
then
said
that
the
english
people
should
suffer
condigne
punishment
generallie
with
losse
of
ancient
liberties
which
before
that
time
they
had
inioied
dunstane
also
long
before
prophesied
of
the
slouthfulnesse
that
should
remaine
in
this
egelred
for
at
what
time
he
ministred
the
sacrament
of
baptisme
to
him
shortlie
after
he
came
into
this
world
he
defiled
the
font
with
the
ordure
of
his
wombe
as
hath
beene
said
whervpon
dunstane
being
troubled
in
mind
by
the
lord
saith
he
and
his
blessed
mother
this
child
shall
prooue
to
be
a
slouthfull
person
it
hath
beene
written
also
that
when
he
was
but
ten
yeeres
of
age
and
heard
that
his
brother
edward
was
slaine
he
so
offended
his
mother
with
wèeping
bicause
she
could
not
still
him
that
hauing
no
rod
at
hand
she
tooke
tapers
or
sizes
that
stood
before
hir
and
beat
him
so
sore
with
them
that
she
had
almost
killed
him
whereby
he
could
neuer
after
abide
to
haue
anie
such
candels
lighted
before
him
sidenote
this
egelred
as
writers
say
was
nothing
giuen
to
warlike
enterprises
but
was
slouthfull
a
louer
of
idlenesse
and
delighting
in
riotous
lusts
which
being
knowne
to
all
men
caused
him
to
be
euill
spoken
of
amongst
his
owne
people
and
nothing
feared
amongst
strangers
heerevpon
the
danes
that
exercised
rouing
on
the
seas
began
to
conceiue
a
boldnesse
of
courage
to
disquiet
and
molest
the
of
the
realme
in
so
much
that
in
the
second
yèere
of
sidenote
this
egelreds
reigne
they
came
with
seuen
ships
on
the
english
coasts
sidenote
of

and
spoiled

the

dunstane
did
send

sithens
he
made
more
account
of

than
of

more
of

than
of
andrew
patrone
of

and
more
of
couetousnesse
than
of
him
being
the

the
mischiefs

had
threatned
would
shortlie
fall

afterward
he
fell
sicke
of
an

which
vexed
him
so
sore
that

grew
so
on

that
he
fell
in
a

as
though

after
that
he
suddenlie
arose
by

caught
a

there
ran
vp

downe
verie
dangerouslie
but
in

came
safelie
downe
and
laid
him
to
slèepe
betwèene

that
watched

but
as
well
his

as
certeine
other
did
raise
a
report
of
him
that
he
gaue
not
himselfe
so
much
to

he
grew
in
such
fauour
that
he
was
aduanced
into
the
seruice
of
king

vpon
a
time
as
he
came
to

wherevpon
he
was
accused
of

and
so
banished
out

began
to

to
women
and
when
elfeagus
then
bishop

he
bethought
him

vpon
his

immediatlie
shore

on
a

towards
him
with
open

and
set
his

suddenlie
wakening
for

the

danes
sailed
into

and
king

went
into

where
the

inhabited
in

whome
he
ouercame

the

pentho

the

hand
thus
the
state
of
the

in
those
daies
was
verie
miserable
for
there
wanted
worthie
chieftains
to
rule
the
people
and
to
chastise
them
when
they
did
amisse
there
was
no
trust

impugned
others
dooing
and
yet
would
not
deuise
which
sidenote
disagrèement
with

what
fruit
it
bringeth
way
to
deale
with

likelihood
when
they
assembled
in
councell
and
should
haue
occupied
their
heads
in
deuising
remedies
for
the
mischiefe
of
the
common
wealth
they
turned
their
purpose
vnto
altercation
about
such
strifes
contentions
and
quarels
as
each
one
against
other
and
suffered
the
generall
case
to
lie
still
in
the
dust
and
if
at
anie
time
there
was
anie
good
conclusion
agreed
vpon
for
the
withstanding
of
the
enimie
relèefe
of

anon
should
the
enimie
be
aduertised
thereof
by
such
as
were
of
aliance
or
consanguinitie
to
them
for
as
caxton
polychr
and
others
say
the
english
bloud
was
so
mixed
with
that
of
the
danes
and
britains
who
were
like
enimies
to
the
englishmen
that
there
was
almost
few
of
the
nobilitie
and
commons
which
had
not
on
the
one
side
a
parent
of
some
of
them
whereby
it
came
to
passe
that
neither
the
secret
purposes
of
the
king
could
be
concealed
till
they
might
take
due
effect
neither
their
assemblies
proue
quiet
without
quarelling
and
taking
of
parts
manie
also
being
sent
foorth
with
their
powers
one
way
whilest
the
king
went
to
make
resistance
another
did
reuolt
to
his
enimies
and
turned
their
swords
against
him
as
you
haue
heard
of
elfrike
and
his
complices
and
shall
read
of
manie
others
so
that
it
was
no
maruell
that
egelred
sped
no
better
and
yet
was
he
as
valiant
as
anie
of
his
predecessors
although
the
moonks
fauour
him
not
in
their
writings
because
he
demanded
aid
of
them
toward
his
warres
and
was
nothing
fauorable
to
their
lewd
hypocrisie
but
what
is
a
king
if
his
subiects
be
not
loiall
what
is
a
realme
if
the
common
wealth
be
diuided
by
peace

and
famous
kingdomes
haue
oft
times
procèeded
whereas
by
discord
the
greatest
kingdoms
haue
oftner
bene
brought
to
ruine
and
so
it
proued
here
for
whilest
priuat
quarels
are
pursued
the
generall
affaires
are
vtterlie
neglected
and
whilest
ech
nation
sèeketh
to

it

is
like
to
become
a
desert
but
to
procèed
with
our
monasticall
writers
certes
they
lay
all
the
fault
in
the
king
saieng
that
he
was
a
man
giuen
to
no

exercise
he
delighted
in
fleshlie
lustes
and

and
still
sought

be

emma
daughter
of
duke
of
normandie
maried
to
k
edgar
obteined
his
purpose
and
so
in
the
yeare
of
our
lord
which
was
about
the
yeare
of
king
egelreds
reigne
he
maried
the
said
emma
with
great
solemnitie
this
mariage
was
thought
to
be
right
necessarie
honorable
and
profitable
for
the
realme
of
england
because
of
the
great
puissance
of
the
norman
princes
in
those
daies
but
as
things
afterward
came
to
passe
it
turned
to
the
subuersion
of
the
whole
english
state
for
by
such
affinitie
and
dealing
as
happened
hereby
betwixt
the
normans
and
englishmen
occasion
in
the
end
was
ministred
to
the
same
normans
to
pretend
a
title
to
the
crowne
of
england
in
prosecuting
of
which
title
they
obteined
and
made
the
whole
conquest
of
the
land
as
after
shall
appeare
egelred
being
greatlie
aduanced
as
he
thought
by
reason
of
his
mariage
deuised
vpon
presumption
thereof
to
cause
all
the
danes
within
the
land
to
be
murthered
in
one
day
herevpon
he
sent
priuie
commissioners
to
all
cities
burrowes
and
townes
within
his
dominions
commanding
the
rulers
and
officers
in
the
same
to
kill
all
such
danes
as
remained
within
their
liberties
at
a
certeine
day
prefixed
being
saint
brices
day
in
the
yeare
and
in
the
sidenote
the
of
nouember
the
murder
of
the
danes
yeare
of
king
egelreds
reigne
herevpon
as
sundrie
writers
agree
in
one
day
houre
this
murther
began
and
was
according
to
the
commission
and
iniunction
executed
but
where
it
first
began
the
same
is
vncerteine
some
say
at
wellowin
in
herefordshire
some
at
a
sidenote
hownhill
or
houndhill
a
place
within
merchington
parish
beside
the
forest
of
nèedwood
somewhat
more
than
two
miles
from
vtoxcester
place
in
staffordshire
called
hownhill
others
in
other
places
but
whersoeuer
it
began
the
dooers
repented
it
after
sidenote
the
miserable
state
of
this
realme
vnder
the
thraldome
of
the
danes
but
now
yer
we
procèed
anie
further
we
will
shew
what
rule
the
danes
kept
here
in
this
realme
before
they
were
thus
murthered
as
in
some
bookes
we
find
recorded
whereas
it
is
shewed
that
the
danes
compelled
the
husbandmen
to
til
the
ground
doo
all
maner
of
labour
and
toile
to
be
doone
about
husbandrie
the
danes
liued
vpon
the
fruit
and
gaines
that
came
thereof
and
kept
the
husbandmens
wiues
their
daughters
maids
and
seruants
vsing
and
abusing
them
at
their
pleasures
and
when
the
husbandmen
came
home
then
could
they
scarse
haue
such
sustenance
of
meats
and
drinkes
as
fell
for
seruants
to
haue
so
that
the
danes
had
all
their
commandements
eating
and
drinking
of
the
best
where
the
sillie
man
that
was
the
owner
could
hardlie
come
to
his
fill
of
the
worst
besides
this
the
common
people
were
so
oppressed
by
the
danes
that
for
feare
and
dread
they
called
sidenote
them
in
euerie
such
house
where
anie
of
them
soiourned
lord
dane
and
if
an
englishman
and
a
dane
chanced
to
mèet
at
anie
bridge
or
streight
passage
the
englishman
must
staie
till
the
lord
dane
were
passed
but
in
processe
of
time
after
the
danes
were
voided
the
land
this
word
lord
dane
was
in
derision
and
despight
of
the
danes
turned
sidenote
lordane
whereof
the
word
came
by
englishmen
into
a
name
of
reproch
as
lordane
which
till
these
our
daies
is
not
forgotten
for
when
the
people
in
manie
parts
of
this
realme
will
note
and
signifie
anie
great
idle
lubber
that
will
not
labour
nor
take
paine
for
his
liuing
they
will
call
him
lordane
thus
did
the
danes
vse
the
englishmen
in
most
vile
manner
and
kept
them
in
such
seruile
thraldome
as
can
not
be
sufficientlie
vttered
fresh
power
of

inuade
england
to
reuenge
the
slaughter
of

this

by

not

permitted
that
his

bicause
all

agree
that
the

was
executed
about
ten
yeeres
before
this
supposed
time
we
haue
made
rehearsall
thereof
in

howbeit
for

of

it

be
that

when

at

therefore
not

well
perceiued

trulie
to

in

where
we
are
borne
i
confesse
it
a

thing
and
i
for
my
part
am
readie
to
take
vpon
me
to
enter
into
the
midst
of
the
enimies
in
defense
of

but
here
i
see
our

and
the
whole

nation
to
be
at
a
point
to
fall
into
vtter
ruine
we
are
ouercome
of
the
danes
not
with
weapon
or
force
of
armes
but
with
treason
wrought
by
our
owne
people
we
did
at
the
first
prepare
a
nauie
against
the
enimies
the
which
that
false
traitour
elfrike
betraid
into
their
hands
againe
oftentimes
haue
we
giuen
battell
with
euill
successe
and
onelie
through
the
fault
of
our
owne
people
that
haue
beene
false
and
disloiall
whereby
we
haue
bin
constreined
to
agree
with
the
enimies
vpon
dishonorable
conditions
euen
as
necessitie
required
which
to
ouercome
resteth
onelie
in
god
such
kind
of
agreement
hath
beene
made
in
deed
to
our
destruction
sith
the
enimies
haue
not
sticked
to
breake
it
they
being
such
a
wicked
kind
of
people
as
neither
regard
god
nor
man
contrarie
to
right
and
reason
and
beside
all
our
hope
expectation
so
that
the
matter
is
come
now
to
this
passe
that
we
haue
not
cause
onlie
to
feare
the
losse
of
our
gouernement
but
least
the
name
of
the
whole
english
nation
be
destroied
for
euer
therefore
sithens
the
enimies
are
at
hand
and
as
it
were
ouer
our
heads
you
to
whom
my
commandement
hath
euer
bene
had
in
good
regard
prouide
take
counsell
and
see
to
succor
the
state
of
your
countrie
now
readie
to
decay
and
to
fall
into
irrecouerable
ruine
herevpon
they
fell
in
consultation
euerie
one
alledging
and
bringing
foorth
his
opinion
as
seemed
to
him
best
but
it
appeared
they
had
the
woolfe
by
the
eare
for
they
wist
not
which
way
to
turne
them
if
they
should
giue
battell
it
was
to
be
doubted
least
through
treason
among
themselues
the
armie
should
be
betraied
into
the
enimies
hands
the
which
would
not
faile
to
execute
all
kind
of
crueltie
in
the
slaughter
of
the
whole
nation
and
if
they
stood
not
valiantlie
to
shew
themselues
readie
to
defend
their
countrie
there
was
no
shift
but
yeeld
themselues
which
though
it
were
a
thing
reprochfull
and
dishonorable
yet
should
it
be
lesse
euill
as
they
tooke
the
matter
for
thereby
might
manie
be
preserued
from
death
and
in
time
to
come
be
able
to
recouer
the
libertie
of
their
countrie
when
occasion
should
be
offered
this
point
was
allowed
of
them
all
and
so
in
the
end
they
rested
vpon
that
resolution
sidenote
king
egelred
determineth
to
give
place
vnto
swaine
king
egelred
therefore
determined
to
commit

should

than

himselfe
like

godlie
prince
at

there
ended

ouer
to
deliuer
his

out

these
newes
were

ioiful
vnto
egelred
who
burning
in
desire
to
be
reuenged
on
them
that
had
expelled
him
out
of

made
no
longer
tariance
to
set
sidenote
edmund
egelreds
eldest
sonne
that
enterprise
forward
but
yet
doubting
the
inconstancie
of
the
people
he
sent
his
elder
son
named
edmund
to
trie
the
minds
of
them
and
to
vnderstand
whether
they
were
constant
or
wauering
in
that
which
they
had
promised
the
yoong
gentleman
hasting
ouer
into
england
and
with
diligent
inquirie
perceiuing
how
they
were
bent
returned
with
like
spèed
as
he
came
into
normandie
againe
declaring
to
his
father
that
all
things
were
in
safetie
if

would
make

and
trusting
vpon
the
assistance
of
the
englishmen
returned
into
england
in
the
time
of
lent
his
returne
was
ioifull
and
most
acceptable
to
the
english
people
as
to
those
that
abhorred
the
sidenote
canutes
endeuor
to
establish
himselfe
in
the
kingdome
rule
of
the
danes
which
was
most
sharpe
and
bitter
to
them
although
cnute
did
what
he
could
by
bountifulnesse
and
courteous
dealings
to
haue
reteined
them
vnder
his
obeisance
and
of
an
intent
to
procure
gods
fauour
in
the
well
ordering
of
things
for
the
administration
in
the
common
wealth
he
sought
first
to
appease
his
wrath
and
also
to
make
amends
to
saint
edmund
for
his
fathers
offense
committed
as
was
thought
against
him
insomuch
sidenote
edmunds
ditch
that
after
he
had
obteined
the
kingdome
he
caused
a
great
ditch
to
be
cast
round
about
the
land
of
saint
edmund
and
granted
manie
frèedoms
to
the
inhabitants
acquiting
them
of
certeine
taskes
and
paiments
vnto
the
which
other
of
their
neighbours
were
contributarie
he
also
builded
a
church
on
the
place
where
saint
edmund
was
buried
and
ordeined
an
house
of
moonks
there
or
rather
remooued
the
canons
or
secular
priests
that
were
there
afore
and
put
moonks
in
their
roomes
he
offered
vp
also
his
crowne
vnto
the
same
edmund
and
sidenote
redèemed
it
againe
with
a
great
summe
of
monie
which
maner
of
dooing
grew
into
an
vse
vnto
other
kings
that
followed
him
he
adorned
the
church
there
with
manie
rich
iewels
and
indowed
the
monasterie
with
great
possessions
but
these
things
were
not
done
now
at
the
first
but
after
that
he
was
established
in
the
kingdome
for
in
the
meane
time
after
that
king
egelred
was
returned
out
of
normandie
cnute
as
then
soiourning
at
gainesbrough
remained
there
till
the
feast
of

and
made
agrèement
with
them
of
lindsey
so
that
finding
him
horsses
they
should
altogither
go
foorth
to
spoile
their
neighbors
king
egelred
aduertised
thereof
sped
him
thither
with
a
mightie
host
and
with
great
crueltie
burned
vp
the
countrie
and
slue
the
more
part
of
the
sidenote
canute
driven
to
forsake
the

bicause
they
had
taken
part
with
his
enimies
cnute
as
then
was
not
of
power
able
to
resist
egelred
and
therefore
taking
his
ships
which
lay
in
humber
fled
from
thence
sailed
about
sidenote
he
was
driuen
thither
by
force
of
contrarie
winds
as
should
appeare
by
the
coast
till
he
came
to
sandwich
and
there
sore
grèeued
in
his
mind
to
remember
what
mischèefe
was
fallen
and
chanced
to
his
friends
and
subiects
of
lindsey
onelie
for
his
cause
he
commanded
that
such
pledges
as
had
bèene
deliuered
to
his
father
by
certeine
noble
men
of
this
realme
for
assurance
of
their
fidelities
should
haue
their
noses
slit
and
their
eares
stuffed
or
as
some
write
their
hands
and
noses
cut
off
sidenote
the
cruell
decrèe
of
cnute
against
the
english
pledges
when
this
cruell
act
according
to
his
commandement
was
doone
taking
the
sea
he
sailed
into
denmarke
but
yet
tooke
not
all
the
danes
with
him
which
his
father
brought
thither
for
earle
turkill
perceiuing
the
wealthinesse
of
the
land
compounded
with
the
englishmen
and
sidenote
this
turkill
was
reteined
in
seruice
with
egelred
as
i
thinke
chose
rather
to
remaine
in
a
region
replenished
with
all
riches
than
to
returne
home
into
his
owne
countrie
that
wanted
such
commodities
as
were
here
to
be
had
and
yet
as
some
thought
he
did
not
forsake
his
souereigne
lord
cnute
for
anie
euill
meaning
towards
him
but
rather
to
aid
him
when
time
serued
to
recouer
the
possession
of
england
againe
as
it
afterwards
well
appeared
for
notwithstanding
that
he
was
now
reteined
by
egelred
with
fortie
ships
and
the
flower
of
all
the
danes
that
were
men
of

so
that
cnute
returned
but
with

into

shortlie
after
erle
turkill
with
of
those
ships
sailed
into
denmarke
submitted
himselfe
vnto
cnute
counselled
him
to
returne
into

and
promised
him
the
assistance
of
the
residue
of
those
danish
ships
which
yet
remained
sidenote
in
england
being
to
the
number
of
thirtie
with
all
the
souldiers
and
mariners
that
to
them
belonged
to
conclude
he
did
so
much
by
his
earnest

matter
by
a
combat
thus
made
he
an
end
and
the
two
princes
allowed
well
of
his
last
motion
and
so
order
was
taken
that
they
should
fight
togither
in
a
singular
combat
within
a
litle
iland
inclosed
with
the
riuer
of
sidenote
oldney
seuerne
called
oldney
with
condition
that
whether
of
them
chanced
to
be
victor
should
be
king
and
the
other
to
resigne
his
title
for
euer
into
his
hands
the
two
princes
entering
into
the
place
appointed
in
faire
armour
began
the
battell
in
sight
of
both
their
armies
ranged
in
goodlie
order
on
either
side
the
riuer
with
doubtfull
minds
and
nothing
ioifull
as
they
that
wauered
betwixt
hope
and
feare
the
two
sidenote
champions
manfullie
assailed
either
other
without
sparing
first
they
went
to
it
on
horssebacke
and
after
on
foot
cnute
was
a
man
sidenote
cnute
of
what
stature
he
was
of
a
meane
stature
but
yet
strong
and
hardie
so
that
receiuing
a
great
blow
by
the
hand
of
his
aduersarie
which
caused
him
somewhat
to
stagger
yet
recouered
himselfe
and
boldly
stept
forward
to
be
reuenged
but
perceiuing
he
could
not
find
aduantage
and
that
sidenote
cnute
ouermatched
he
was
rather
too
weake
and
shrewdlie
ouermatched
he
spake
to
sidenote
cnutes
woords
to
edmund
edmund
with
a
lowd
voice
on
this
wise
what
necessitie
saith
he
ought
thus
to
mooue
vs
most
valiant
prince
that
for
the
obteining
of
a
kingdome
we
should
thus
put
our
liues
in
danger
better
were
it
that
laieng
armour
and
malice
aside
we
should
condescend
to
some
reasonable
agreement
let
vs
become
sworne
brethren
and
part
the
sidenote
kingdome
betwixt
vs
and
let
vs
deale
so
friendlie
that
thou
maist
vse
my
things
as
thine
owne
and
i
thine
as
though
they
were
mine
king
edmund
with
those
woords
of
his
aduersarie
was
so
pacified
that
immediatlie
he
cast
awaie
his
swoord
and
comming
to
sidenote
they
make
vp
the
matter
betwixt
themselves
cnute
ioined
hands
with
him
both
the
armies
by
their
example
did
the
like
which
looked
for
the
same
fortune
to
fall
on
their
countries
which
should
happen
to
their
princes
by
the
successe
of
that
one
battell
after
this
there
was
an
agrèement
deuised
betwixt
them
so
that
a
partition
of
the
realme
was
made
and
that
part
that
lieth
fore
against
france
was
assigned
to
edmund
and
the
other
sidenote
fell
to
cnute
there
be
that
write
how
the
offer
was
made
by
king
edmund
for
the
auoiding
of
more
bloudshed
that
the
two
princes
should
trie
the
matter
thus
togither
in
a
singular
combat
but
cnute
refused
the
combat
bicause
as
he
alledged
the
match
was
not
equall
for
although
he
was
able
to
match
edmund
in
boldnesse
of
stomach
yet
was
he
farre
too
weake
to
deale
with
a
man
of
such
strength
as
edmund
was
knowne
to
be
but
sith
they
did
pretend
title
to
the
realme
by
due
and
good
direct
meanes
he
thought
it
most
conuenient
that
the
kingdome
should
be
diuided
betwixt
them
this
motion
was
allowed
of
both
the
armies
so
that
king
edmund
was
of
force
constreined
to
be
contented
therewith
thus
our
common
writers
haue
recorded
of
this
agrèement
but
if
i
should
not
be
thought
presumptuous
in
taking
vpon
me
to
reprooue
or
rather
but
to
mistrust
that
which
hath
bèene
receiued
for
a
true
narration
in
this
matter
i
would
rather
giue
credit
vnto
that
sidenote
which
the
author
of
the
booke
intituled
encomium
emmê
dooth
report
in
this
behalfe
which
is
that
through
persuasion
of
edrike
de
streona
king
edmund
immediatelie
after
the
battell
fought
at
ashdone
sent
ambassadors
vnto
cnute
to
offer
vnto
him
peace
with
halfe
the
realme
of
england
that
is
to
say
the
north
parts
with
condition
that
king
edmund
might
quietlie
inioy
the
south
parts
and
therevpon
haue
pledges
deliuered
interchangeablie
on
either
side
cnute
hauing
heard
the
effect
of
this
message
staied
to
make
answer
till
he
heard
what
his
councell
would
aduise
him
to
doo
in
this
behalfe
and
vpon
good
deliberation
taken
in
the
matter
considering
that
he
had
lost
no
small
number
of
people
in
the
former
battell
and
that
being
farre
out
of
his
countrie
he
could
not
well
haue
anie
new
supplie
where
the
englishmen
although
they
had
likewise
lost
verie
manie
of
their
men
of
warre
yet
being
in
their
owne
countrie
it
should
be
an
easie
matter
for
them
to
restore
their
decaid
number
it
was
thought
expedient
by
the
whole
consent
of
all
the
danish
capteins
that
the
offer
of
king
edmund
should
be
accepted
herevpon
cnute
calling
the
ambassadors
before
him
againe
declared
vnto
them
that
he
was
contented
to
conclude
a
peace
vpon
such
conditions
as
they
had
offered
but
yet
with
this
addition
that
their
king
whatsoeuer
he
should
be
should
paie
cnutes
souldiers
their
wages
with
monie
to
be
leuied
of
that
part
of
the
kingdome
which
the
english
king
should
possesse
for
this
saith
he
i
haue
vndertaken
to
sèe
them
paid
and
otherwise
i
will
not
grant
to
anie
peace
the
league
and
agrèement
therefore
being
concluded
in
this
sort
pledges
were
deliuered
and
receiued
on
both
parties
and
the
armies
sidenote
this
is
alleged
touching
the
partiti
of
the
kingdome
discharged
but
god
saith
mine
author
being
mindfull
of
his
old
doctrine
that
euerie
kingdome
diuided
in
it
selfe
can
not
long
stand
shortlie
after
tooke
edmund
out
of
this
life
and
by
such
meanes
sèemed
to
take
pitie
of
the
english
kingdome
lest
if
both
the
kings
should
haue
continued
in
life
togither
they
should
haue
liued
in
danger
and
incontinentlie
herevpon
was
cnute
chosen
and
receiued
for
absolute
king
of
all
the
whole
realme
of
england
thus
hath
he
written
that
liued
in
those
daies
whose
credit
thereby
is
much
aduanced
howbeit
the
common
report
of
writers
touching
the
death
of
edmund
varieth
from
this
who
doo
affirme
that
after
cnute
and
edmund
were
made
friends
the
serpent
of
enuie
and
false
conspiracie
burnt
so
in
the
hearts
of
some
traitorous
persons
that
within
a
while
after
sidenote
edmund
traitorouslie
slaine
at
oxford
king
edmund
was
slaine
at
oxford
as
he
sat
on
a
priuie
to
doo
the
necessaries
of
nature
the
common
report
hath
gone
that
earle
edrike
was
the
procurer
of
this
villanous
act
and
that
as
some
write
his
sonne
did
it
but
the
author
that
wrote
encomium
emmê
writing
of
the
death
of
edmund
hath
these
words
immediatlie
after
he
had
first
declared
in
what
sort
the
two
princes
were
agrèed
and
had
made
sidenote
this
is
alleged
againe
for
the
proofe
of
edmunds
natural
death
partition
of
the
realme
betwixt
them
but
god
saith
he
being
mindfull
of
his
old
doctrine
that
euerie
kingdome
diuided
in
it
selfe
can
not
long
stand
shortlie
after
tooke
edmund
out
of
this
life
and
by
such
meanes
sèemed
to
take
pitie
vpon
the
english
kingdome
least
if
both
the
kings
should
haue
continued
in
life
togither
they
should
both
haue
liued
in
great
danger
and
the
realme
in
trouble
with
this
agreeth
also
simon
dunel
who
saith
that
king
edmund
died
of
naturall
sidenote
sicknesse
by
course
of
kind
at
london
about
the
feast
of
saint
andrew
next
insuing
the
late
mentioned
agreement
sidenote
and
this
should
sèeme
true
for
whereas
these
authors
which
report
that
earle
edrike
was
the
procurer
of
his
death
doo
also
write
that
when
he
knew
the
act
to
be
done
he
hasted
vnto
cnute
and
declared
vnto
him
what
he
had
brought
to
passe
for
his
aduancement
to
the
gouernment
of
the
whole
realme
wherevpon
cnute
abhorring
such
a
detestable
fact
said
vnto
him
bicause
thou
hast
for
my
sake
made
away
the
worthiest
bodie
of
the
world
i
shall
raise
thy
head
aboue
all
the
lords
of
england
and
so
caused
him
to
be
put
to
death
sidenote
some
thinke
that
he
was
duke
of
mercia
before
and
now
had
essex
adioined
thereto
thus
haue
some
bookes
howbeit
this
report
agreeth
not
with
other
writers
which
declare
how
cnute
aduanced
edrike
in
the
beginning
of
his
reigne
vnto
high
honor
and
made
him
gouernor
of
mercia
and
vsed
his
counsell
in
manie
things
after
the
death
of
king
edmund

in

of

edmund
with
his
sonnes
also
edmund
and
edward
sidenote
diuerse
and
discordant

for
that
there
is

variable

amongst

touching

death
of

edmund
and
some
fables
inuented
thereof
as
the
manner
is
we
will
let
the
residue
of
their
reports
passe
sith
certeine
it
is
that

he
came

reigned
about
the

so
much

as

chamber
and
there
in
reasoning
the
matter
about
some
quarrell
that
was
picked
to

he
began
verie
presumptuouslie
to
vpbraid
the

of
such
pleasures
as
he
had
before

doone
vnto
him
i
did
said
he
for

i

towards
you
forsake
my

lord
king
edmund
and
at

for
your

slue
him
at
which
words
cnute
began
to
change
countenance
as
one
maruellouslie
abashed
and
straightwaies
gaue
sentence
against
edrike
in
this
wise
thou

saith
he
of

guiltie
of

therefore
be
vpon
thine
owne
head
sith
thy

hath
vttered

and
immediatlie
he
caused
his
throat
to
be
cut
and
his
bodie
to
be
throwen
out
at
the
chamber
window
into
the
sidenote
edrike
put
to

of

but
others
say
that
hands
were
laid
vpon
him
in
the
verie

chamber
or
closet
where
he
murdered
the
king
straightwaies
to
preuent
all
causes
of

he
was
put
to

with
terrible

execution
hauing
passed

a

his

drawne
through

him
worthie

being
a

which
the

pagans
abhorred
else
would
they
not
haue
said

a

i

this
was
the
end
of
edrike
surnamed
de

or
streona
a
man
of
great
infamie
for
his
craftie
dissimulation
falshood
and
treason
vsed
by
him
to
the
ouerthrow
of
the

as
partlie
before

but
there
be
that
concerning
the
cause
of
this
edriks
death
sèeme
partlie
to
disagrèe
from
that
which
before
is
recited
declaring
that
cnute
standing
in
some
doubt
to
be
betraied
through
the
treason
of
edrike
sought
occasion
how
to
rid
him
and
others
whome
he
mistrusted
out
of
the
way
and
therefore
on
a
day
when
edrike
craued
some
preferment
at
cnuts
hands
said
that
he
had
deserued
to
be
well
thought
of
sith
by
his
flight
from
the
battell
at
ashendon
the
victorie
therby
inclined
to
cnutes
part
cnute
hearing
him
speake
these
words
made
this
answere
and
canst
thou
quoth
he
be
true
to
me
that
through
fraudulent
meanes
diddest
deceiue
thy
lord
and
maister
but
i
will
reward
thèe
according
to
thy
deserts
so
as
from
henceforth
thou
shalt
not
deceiue
anie

and
so
forthwith
commanded
erike
one
of
his
chiefe
capteines
to
dispatch
him
who
incontinentlie
cut
off
his

with
his

had

betraied
by
the
said
edrike
stood
in
great
doubt
to
be
likewise
deceiued
by
him
and
therefore
was
glad
to
haue
some
pretended
quarell
to
dispatch
both
him
and
others
whome
he
likewise
mistrusted
as
it
well
appeared
for

in

whome
he
found
vnfaithfull
or
rather
suspected
he
put
to
death
as
before
ye
haue
heard
beside
such
as
he
banished
out
of
the

he
raised
a

easilie
distressed

a

earlie
when
as
cnute
heard
that
the

were
gone
foorth
of

he
supposed
that
they
were
either
fled
awaie
or
else
turned
to
take
part
with
the
enimies
but
as
he
approched
to
the
enimies
campe
he
vnderstood
how
the
mater
went
for
he
found
nothing
there
but
sidenote
cnute
had
the
englishmen
in
estimation
for
their
good
service
bloud
dead
bodies
and
the
spoile
for
which
good
seruice
cnute
had
the
englishmen
in
more
estimation
euer
after
and
highlie
rewarded
their
leader
the
same
earle
goodwine
when
cnute
had
ordered
all
things
in
denmarke
as
was
thought
behoofefull
he
returned
againe
into
england
and
within
a
few
daies
after
he
was
aduertised
that
the
swedeners
made
warre
against

of

vnder
the

cnute
passeth
againe
into

leding
of
two
great

and

wherefore
to
defend
his
dominions
in
those
parts
he
passed
againe
with
an
armie
into
denmarke
incountred
with
his
enimies
and
receiued
a
sore
ouerthrow
sidenote
loosing
a
great
number
both
of
danes
and
englishmen
but
gathering
togither
a
new
force
of
men
he
set
againe
vpon
his
enimies
and
ouercame
them
constreining
the
two
foresaid
princes
to
agrèe
vpon

reasonable
conditions
of

matth
west
recounteth
that
at
this

earle
goodwine
and
the

wrought
the
enterprise
aboue
mentioned
of
assaulting
the

campe
in
the
night
season
after
cnute
had
first
lost
in
the
day
before
no
small
number
of
his
people
and
that
then
the
foresaid
princes
or
kings
as
he
nameth
them
vlfus
sidenote
and
aulafus
which
latter
he
calleth
eiglafe
were
constrained
to
agrèe
vpon
a
peace
the
danish
chronicles
alledge
that
the
occasion
of
this
warre
rose
hereof
this
olauus
aided
cnute
as
the
same
writers
report
against
king
edmund
and
the
englishmen
but
when
the
peace
should
be
made
betwèene
cnute
and
edmund
there
was
no
consideration
had
of
olauus
whereas
through
him
the
danes
chieflie
obteined
the
victorie
herevpon
olauus
was
sore
offended
in
his
mind
against
cnute
and
now
vpon
occasion
sought
to
be
reuenged
but
what
soeuer
the
cause
was
of
this
warre
betwixt
these
two
princes
the
end
was
thus
that
olauus
was
expelled
out
of
his
kingdome
and
constreined
to
flèe
to
gerithaslaus
a
duke
in
the
parties
of
eastland
and
afterward
returning
into
norwaie
was
slaine
by
such
of
his
subiects
as
tooke
part
with
cnute
in
manner
as
in
the
historie
of
norwaie
appeareth
more
at
large
with
the
contrarietie
found
in
the
writings
of
them
which
haue
recorded
the
histories
of
those
north
sidenote
magnus
olauus
regions
sidenote
but
here
is
to
be
remembred
that
the
fame
and
glorie
of
the
english
nation
was
greatlie
aduanced
in
these
warres
as
well
against
the
swedeners
as
the
norwegians
so
that
cnute
began
to
loue
and
trust
the
englishmen
much
better
than
it
was
to
be
thought
he
would
euer
sidenote
other
say
that
he
went
forth
of
denmarke
to
rome
anno
haue
doone
shortlie
after
that
cnute
was
returned
into
england
that
is
to
say
as
some
haue
in
the
yeare
of
his
reigne
he
went
to
rome
to
performe
his
vow
which
he
had
made
to
visit
the
places
where
the
apostles
peter
and
paule
had
their
buriall
where
he
was
honorablie
receiued
of
pope
iohn
the
that
then
held
the
sèe
when
he
had
doone
his
deuotion
there
he
returned
into
england
in
the
yeare
following
he
made
a
iournie
against
the
scots
which
as
sidenote
scots
subdued
anno
then
had
rebelled
but
by
the
princelie
power
of
cnute
they
were
subdued
and
brought
againe
to
obedience
so
that
not
onelie
king
malcolme
but
also
two
other
kings
melbeath
and
ieohmare
became
his
subiects
finallie
after
that
this
noble
prince
king
cnute
had
sidenote
the
death
of
king
cnute
reigned
the
tearme
of
yeares
currant
after
the
death
of
ethelred
he
died
at
shaftsburie
as
the
english
writers
affirme
on
the
of
nouember
and
was
buried
at
winchester
but
the
danish
chronicles
record
that
he
died
in
normandie
and
was
buried
at
rome
as
in
the
same
chronicles
ye
may
reade
more
at
large
trespuissance
of
cnute
the
amplenesse
of
his
dominions
the
good
and
charitable
fruits
of
his
voiage
to
rome
redounding
to
the
common
benefit
of
all
trauellers
from
england
thither
with
what
great
personages
he
had
conference
and
the
honour
that
was
doone
him
there
his
intollerable
pride
in
commanding
the
waters
of
the
flouds
not
to
rise
he
humbleth
himselfe
and
confesseth
christ
iesus
to
be
king
of
kings
he
refuseth
to
weare
the
crowne
during
his
life
he
reproueth
a
gentleman
flatterer
his
issue
legitimate
and
illegitimate
his
inclination
in
his
latter
yeares
what
religious
places
he
erected
repaired
and
inriched
what
notable
men
he
fauoured
and
reuerenced
his
lawes
and
that
in
causes
as
well
ecclesiasticall
as
temporall
he
had
cheefe
and
sole
gouernement
in
this
land
whereby
the
popes
vsurped
title
of
vniuersall
supremasie
is
the
xiij
chapter
sidenote
the
large
dominion
of
cnute
this
cnute
was
the
mightiest
prince
that
euer
reigned
ouer
the
english
people
for
he
had
the
souereigne
rule
ouer
all
denmark
england
norwaie
scotland
and
part
of
sweiden
amongest
other
of
his
roiall
acts
he
caused
such
tolles
and
tallages
as
were
demanded
of
at
bridges
and
strèets
in
the
high
way
betwixt
england
and
rome
to
be
diminished
to
the
halfes
and
againe
got
also
a
moderation
to
be
had
in
the
paiment
of
the
archbishops
fees
of
his
realme
which
was
leuied
of
them
in
the
court
of
rome
when
they
should
receiue
their
palles
as
may
appeare
by
a
letter
which
he
himselfe
being
at
rome
directed
to
the
bishops
and
other
of
the
nobles
of
england
in
the
which
it
also
appeareth
that
besides
the
roiall
interteinment
which
he
had
at
rome
of
pope
iohn
he
had
conference
there
with
the
emperour
conrad
with
rafe
the
king
of
burgongne
and
manie
other
great
princes
and
noble
men
which
were
present
there
at
that
time
all
which
at
his
sidenote
grants
made
to
the
benefit
of
englishmen
at
the
instance
of
king
cnute
request
in
fauour
of
those
englishmen
that
should
trauell
vnto
rome
granted
as
we
haue
said
to
diminish
such
duties
as
were
gathered
of
passingers
he
receiued
there
manie
great
gifts
of
the
emperour
and
was
highlie
honored
of
him
and
likewise
of
the
pope
and
of
all
other
the
high
princes
at
that
time
present
at
rome
so
that
when
he
came
home
as
some
write
he
did
grow
greatlie
into
pride
insomuch
that
being
sidenote
he
caused
his
chaire
to
be
set
there
as
saith
nèere
to
the
thames
or
rather
as
other
write
vpon
the
sea
strand
nèere
to
southhampton
and
perceiuing
the
water
to
rise
by
reason
of
the
tide
he
cast
off
his
gowne
and
wrapping
it
round
togither
threw
it
on
the
sands
verie
neere
the
increasing
water
and
sat
him
downe
vpon
it
speaking
these
or
the
like
words
to
the
sea
thou
art
saith
he
within
the
compasse
of
my

and
the
ground
whereon
i
sit
is
mine
and
thou
knowest
that
no
wight
dare
disobeie
my

i
therefore
doo
now
command
thèe
not
to

the

onelie
vpon

in

one
of

gaue
him
by

rightlie
tooke

sidenote
flatterie
reproued
mightiest
king
of

which
ruled
most
at

both

therefore
to
reprooue
the
fond

of
such
vaine
persons
he
deuised
and
practised
the
dèed
before

thereby
both
to
reprooue
such

also
that

might
be
admonished
to

where
he
obteined
the

was

with

when

the

might
make
the

their

thus
did
cnute
striue
to

whereby
as

be

not

vpon

had

alfred
the

egelred
with

landed
at

obteine

from

he
came
to
canturburie
and
shortlie
after
earle
goodwine
feining
to
receiue
him
as
a
friend
came
to
meet
him
and
at
gilford
in
the
night
season
appointed
a
number
of
armed
men
to
fall
vpon
the

as
they
were

so
tooke

togither
with

slue
the

by
the
poll
in
such
wise
that
nine
were

the
tenth
reserued
but
yet
when
those
that
were
reserued
seemed
to
him
a
greater
number
than
he
wished
to
escape
he
fell
to
and
againe
tithed
them
as
before
alfred
had
his
eies
put
out
and
was
conueied
to
the
ile
of
elie
where
shortlie
after
he
died
sidenote
how
alfred
should
claime
the
crowne
to
himselfe
i
sèe
not
for
verelie
i
can
not
be
persuaded
that
he
was
the
elder
brother
though
diuers
authors
haue
so
written
sith
gemeticensis
the
author
of
the
booke
called
encomium
emmê
plainlie
affirme
that
edward
was
the
elder
but
it
might
be
that
alfred
being
a
man
of
a
stouter
stomach
sidenote
sèe
maister
acts
and
monuments
pag
than
his
brother
edward
made
this
attempt
either
for
himselfe
or
in
the
behalfe
of
his
brother
edward
being
as
then
absent
and
gone
into
hungarie
as
some
write
but
other
say
that
as
well
edward
as
alfred
came
ouer
at
this
time
with
a
number
of
norman
knights
and
men
of
warre
imbarked
in
a
few
ships
onelie
to
speake
with
their
mother
who
as
then
lay
at
winchester
whether
to
take
aduise
with
hir
how
to
recouer
their
right
heere
in
this
land
or
to
aduance
their
brother
hardicnute
or
for
some
other
purpose
our
authors
doo
not
declare
but
the
lords
of
the
realme
that
bare
their
good
wils
vnto
harold
and
though
contrarie
to
right
ment
to
mainteine
him
in
the
estate
seemed
to
be
much
offended
with
the
comming
of
these
two
brethren
in
such
order
for
earle
goodwine
persuaded
them
that
it
was
great
danger
to
suffer
so
manie
strangers
to
enter
the
realme
as
they
had
brought
with
them
wherevpon
earle
goodwine
with
the
assent
of
the
other
lords
or
rather
by
commandement
of
harold
went
foorth
and
at
gilford
met
with
alfred
that
was
comming
towards
king
harold
to
speake
with
him
accordinglie
as
he
was
of
harold
required
to
doo
but
now
being
taken
and
his
companie
miserablie
murthered
as
before
ye
haue
heard
to
the
number
of
six
hundred
normans
alfred
himselfe
was
sent
into
the
ile
of
elie
there
to
remaine
in
the
abbeie
in
custodie
of
the
moonks
hauing
his
eies
put
out
as
soone
as
he
entered
first
into
the
same
ile
william
malmesburie
saith
that
alfred
came
ouer
and
was
thus
handeled
betwixt
the
time
of
harolds
death
the
comming
in
of
hardicnute
others
write
that
this
chanced
in
his
brother
hardicnuts
daies
which
sèemeth
not
to
be
true
for
hardicnute
was
knowne
to
loue
his
brethren
by
his
mothers
side
too
dearelie
to
haue
suffered
anie
such
iniurie
to
be
wrought
against
either
of
them
in
his
time
thus
ye
sèe
how
writers
dissent
in
this
matter
but
for
the
better
clearing
of
the
truth
touching
the
time
i
haue
thought
good
to
shew
also
what
the
author
of
the
said
booke
intituled
encomium
emmê
writeth
hereof
which
is
as
followeth
when
harold
was
once
established
king
he
sought
meanes
how
to
rid
quèene
emma
out
of
the
way
and
that
secretlie
for
that
openlie
as
yet
he
durst
not
attempt
anie
thing
against
hir
she
in
silence
kept
hir
selfe
quiet
looking
for
the
end
of
these
things
but
harold
remembring
himselfe
of
a
malicious
purpose
by
wicked
aduise
tooke
counsell
how
he
might
get
into
his
hands
and
make
away
the
sons
of
quèene
emma
so
to
be
out
of
danger
of
all
annoiance
that
by
them
might
be
procured
against
him
wherefore

how

went
ouer

and
presenting

vnto
the

vsed
the

so
that
they
thought

that

wrote
againe
by

that

a
certeine
number
of

and
first
came

where
after

had
remained
a
while
with
earle
baldwine
he
increased
his
retinue
with
a
few
bullogners
and
passed
ouer
into
england
but
approching
to
the
shore
he
was
streightwaies
descried
by
his
enimies
who
hasted
foorth
to
set
vpon
him
but
perceiuing
their
drift
he
bad
the
ships
cast
about
and
make
againe
to
the
sea
then
landing
at
an
other
place
he
ment
to
go
the
next
way
to
his
mother
sidenote
godwin
was
suspected
to
do
this
vnder
a
colour
to
betray
him
as
by
writers
it
sèemeth
but
earle
goodwine
hearing
of
his
arriuall
met
him
receiued
him
into
his
assurance
and
binding
his
credit
with
a
corporall
oth
became
his
man
and
therwith
leading
him
out
of
the
high
way
that
leadeth
to
london
he
brought
him
to
gilford
where
he
lodged
all
the
strangers
by
a
score
a
doozen
and
halfe
a
score
togither
in
innes
so
as
but
a
few
remained
about
the
yoong
gentleman
alfred
to
attend
vpon
him
there
was
plentie
of
meat
and
drinke
prepared
in
euerie
lodging
for
the
refreshing
of
all
the
companie
and
goodwine
taking
his
leaue
for
that
night
departed
to
his
lodging
promising
the
next
morning
to
come
againe
to
giue
his
dutifull
attendance
on
alfred
but
behold
after
they
had
filled
themselues
with
meats
and
drinks
sidenote
not
onelie
goodwine
but
other
such
as
king
harold
appointed
took
alfred
with
his
normans
and
were
gone
to
bed
in
the
dead
of
the
night
came
such
as
king
harold
had
appointed
and
entring
into
euerie
inne
first
seized
vpon
the
armor
and
weapons
that
belonged
to
the
strangers
which
done
they
tooke
them
and
chained
them
fast
with
fetters
and
manacles
so
kèeping
them
sure
till
the
next
morning
which
being
come
they
were
brought
foorth
with
their
hands
bound
behind
their
backs
and
deliuered
to
most
cruell
tormentors
who
were
commanded
to
spare
none
but
euerie
tenth
man
as
he
came
to
hand
by
lot
and
so
they
slue
nine
and
left
the
tenth
aliue
of
those
that
were
left
aliue
some
they
kept
to
serue
as
bondmen
other
for
couetousnesse
of
gaine
they
sold
and
some
they
put
in
prison
of
whome
yet
diuerse
afterwards
escaped
this
with
more
hath
the
foresaid
author
written
of
this
matter
declaring
further
that
alfred
being
conueied
into
the
ile
of
elie
had
not
onelie
his
eies
put
out
in
most
cruell
wise
but
was
also
presentlie
there
murthered
but
he
speaketh
not
further
of
the
maner
how
he
was
made
away
sauing
that
he
saith
he
forbeareth
to
make
long
recitall
of
this
matter
bicause
he
will
not
renew
the
mothers
grèefe
in
hearing
it
sith
there
can
be
no
greater
sorrow
to
the
mother
than
to
heare
of
hir
sonnes
death
i
remember
in
caxton
we
read
that
his
cruell
tormentors
should
cause
his
bellie
to
be
opened
taking
out
one
end
of
his
bowels
or
guts
tied
the
same
to
a
stake
which
they
had
set
fast
in
the
ground
then
with
nèedels
of
iron
pricking
his
bodie
they
caused
him
to
run
about
the
stake
till
he
had
woond
out
all
his
intrailes
so
ended
he
his
innocent
life
to
the
great
shame
obloquie
of
his
cruel
aduersaries
but
whether
he
was
thus
tormented
or
not
or
rather
died
as
i
thinke
of
the
anguish
by
putting
out
his
eies
no
doubt
but
his
death
was
reuenged
by
gods
hand
in
those
that
procured
it
but
whether
erle
goodwine
was
chèefe
causer
thereof
in
betraieng
him
vnder
a
cloked
colour
of
pretended
frèendship
i
can
not
say
but
that
he
tooke
him
and
slue
his
companie
as
some
haue
written
i
can
not
thinke
it
to
be
true
both
as
well
for
that
which
ye
haue
heard
recited
out
of
the
author
that
wrote
encomium
emmê
as
also
for
that
it
should
sèeme
he
might
neuer
be
so
directlie
charged
with
it
but
that
he
had

to
alledge
in
his
owne
excuse

beene
brought

now
to

suddenlie
with

where
on

in
this

ceased
the
rule
of

within
this

with
the
persecution
which
they
had
executed
against
the
english
nation
for
the
space
of
yeres
more
that
is
to
say
euer
since
the
tenth
yeere
of
brithrike
the
king
of
westsaxons
at
what
time
they
first
began
to
inuade
the
english
coasts
howbeit
after
others
they
should
sèeme
to
haue
ruled
here
but
reckoning
from
their
bringing
in
by
the
welshmen
in
despite
of
the
saxons
at
which
time
they
first
began
to
inhabit
here
which

but
to

this
pèece

passe
this

felt
that

had
a
time
of
arriuall
a
time
of
inuading
a
time
of
ouerrunning

a
time
of
ouerruling

casteth

he
can
not

enter
into
a
dolefull
consideration
of

lamenting
the
defacements
of

of

wish

saith
and
earnestlie
desire
in

that

may
neuer
light

but
may
be
auerted
and
turned
away
from
all
christian
kingdomes
through
his
mercie
whose
wrath
by
sinne
being
set
on
fire
is
like
a
consuming
flame
and
the
swoord
of
whose
vengeance
being
sharpened
with
the
whetstone
of

wickednesse
shall
hew
them
in
