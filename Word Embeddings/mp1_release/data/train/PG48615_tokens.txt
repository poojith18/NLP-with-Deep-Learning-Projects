chapter
i
eastern
seas
my
first
cruise
as
a
midshipman
in
the
navy
of
the
united
states
began
a
short
month
too
late
for
me
to
share
in
the
honors
of
the
mexican
war
in
other
words
i
came
in
at
the
foot
of
the
service
with
all
the
grades
above
me
with
comparatively
young
and
vigorous
officers
as
a
consequence
the
rate
of
promotion
was
so
slow
that
the
summer
of
found
me
at
the
age
of
still
a
middie
with
my
lieutenancy
ever
receding
like
a
into
the
future
had
i
chosen
a
naval
career
through
necessity
i
might
have
continued
to
endure
but
to
the
equal
though
younger
heir
of
one
of
the
largest
plantations
in
south
carolina
the
pay
of
even
a
post
captain
would
have
been
of
small
concern
it
is
therefore
hardly
necessary
to
add
that
i
had
been
lured
into
the
service
by
the
hope
of
winning
fame
and
glory
that
my
choice
should
have
fallen
upon
the
navy
rather
than
the
army
may
have
been
due
to
the
impulse
of
heredity
according
to
family
traditions
and
records
one
of
my
ancestors
was
the
famous
english
seaman
will
adams
who
served
queen
elizabeth
in
the
glorious
fight
against
the
spanish
armada
and
afterwards
piloted
a
dutch
ship
through
the
dangerous
straits
of
magellan
and
across
the
vast
unchartered
expanse
of
the
pacific
to
the
mysterious
island
empire
then
known
as
cipango
or
zipangu
history
itself
verifies
that
wonderful
voyage
and
the
still
more
wonderful
fact
of
my
life
among
the
japanese
as
one
of
the
nobles
and
chief
counsellors
of
the
great
emperor
iyeyasu
so
highly
was
the
advice
of
the
bold
englishman
esteemed
by
the
emperor
that
he
was
never
permitted
to
return
home
for
many
years
he
dwelt
honorably
among
that
most
peculiar
of
oriental
peoples
aiding
freely
the
few
english
and
dutch
who
ventured
into
the
remote
eastern
seas
he
had
aided
even
the
fanatical
portuguese
and
spaniards
who
upon
his
arrival
had
sought
to
have
him
and
his
handful
of
sick
and
starving
shipmates
executed
as
pirates
so
it
was
he
lived
and
died
a
japanese
noble
and
was
buried
with
all
honor
with
the
blood
of
such
a
man
in
my
veins
it
is
not
strange
that
i
turned
to
the
sea
yet
it
is
no
less
strange
that
three
years
in
the
service
should
bring
me
to
an
utter
weariness
of
the
dull
naval
routine
notable
as
were
the
achievements
of
our
navy
throughout
the
world
in
respect
to
exploration
and
other
peaceful
triumphs
it
has
ever
surprised
me
that
in
the
absence
of
war
and
promotion
i
should
have
lingered
so
long
in
my
inferior
position
in
war
the
humiliation
of
servitude
to
seniority
may
be
thrust
from
thought
by
the
hope
of
winning
superior
rank
through
merit
deprived
of
this
opportunity
i
could
not
but
chafe
under
my
galling
subjection
to
the
commands
of
men
never
more
than
my
equals
in
social
rank
and
far
too
often
my
inferiors
the
climax
came
after
a
year
on
the
china
station
to
which
i
had
obtained
an
assignment
in
the
hope
of
renewed
action
against
the
arrogant
celestials
disappointed
in
this
and
depressed
by
a
severe
spell
of
fever
contracted
at
honkong
i
resigned
the
service
at
shanghai
and
took
passage
for
new
york
by
way
of
san
francisco
and
the
horn
on
the
american
clipper
we
cleared
for
the
sandwich
islands
august
the
the
second
noon
found
us
safe
across
the
treacherous
bars
of
the
and
headed
out
across
the
eastern
sea
the
southwest
monsoon
bowling
us
along
at
a
round
twelve
knots
the
double
lassitude
of
my
convalescence
and
the
season
had
rendered
me
too
indifferent
to
inquire
about
my
we
were
well
under
way
before
i
learned
that
aside
from
the
officers
and
crew
i
was
the
only
person
aboard
ship
in
view
of
the
voyage
of
from
five
to
six
duration
which
lay
before
me
this
discovery
roused
me
to
the
point
of
observing
the
characters
of
the
skipper
and
his
mates
much
to
my
chagrin
i
found
that
all
were
yankees
of
the
most
pronounced
nasal
type
as
a
late
naval
officer
no
less
than
as
a
southern
gentleman
i
could
not
humble
myself
to
social
intercourse
with
the
mates
fortunately
captain
downing
was
somewhat
less
unbearable
and
had
the
good
taste
to
share
my
interest
in
the
mysterious
islands
of
japan
as
well
as
my
detestation
of
china
even
as
the
low
dreary
coast
of
kiangsu
faded
from
view
in
our
wake
we
attained
to
a
cordial
exchange
of
congratulations
over
the
fact
that
we
were
at
last
quit
of
the
filth
and
fantasies
of
the
celestial
empire
as
we
wheeled
about
from
the
last
glance
astern
downing
pointed
over
the
side
with
a
jerk
of
his
thumb
at
that
dirty
flood
adams
just
like
a
china
river
to
try
to
turn
the
whole
sea
china
yellow
conceited
as
john
chinaman
himself
the
devil
his
due
i
drawled
nation
on
earth
and
close
upon
the
biggest
and
thank
providence
every
last
one
of
their
three
hundred
million
pigtails
lie
abaft
my
taffrail
and
every
drop
of
that
foul
flood
soon
to
lose
itself
in
clean
blue
water
he
stared
ahead
combing
his
fingers
through
his
bushy
whiskers
his
shrewd
eyes
twinkling
with
satisfaction
blue
water
the
whole
breadth
of
the
pacific
before
us
and
asia
all
asia
i
corrected
have
yet
to
clear
the
loo
loo
choos
he
repeated
people
i
guess
they
are
said
to
be
a
kind
of
hard
to
tell
i
replied
may
be
chinese
yet
some
say
the
islands
are
subject
to
japan
then
got
good
reason
to
be
queer
he
paced
across
the
deck
and
back
his
jaw
set
and
eyes
keen
with
sudden
resolve
ginger
do
it
this
passage
sir
danged
if
i
been
wanting
to
see
something
of
the
japanese
islands
ever
since
i
came
out
to
the
china
seas
as
a
and
fifty
years
run
out
of
your
course
for
a
glimpse
of
the
japanese
coast
i
exclaimed
no
less
incredulous
than
delighted
than
a
glimpse
adams
van
diemen
strait
is
a
shorter
course
than
the
loo
choo
passage
and
with
this
weather
of
the
typhoon
season
i
cut
in
with
purposeful
superciliousness
of
tone
the
captain
of
a
clipper
is
as
sensitive
to
any
aspersions
on
his
seamanship
as
the
grayest
master
of
navigation
in
the
navy
downing
bit
snappily
be
damned
i
navigated
a
whaler
through
uncharted
seas
twenty
odd
years
and
never
lost
my
ship
take
the
through
van
diemen
strait
blow
or
calm
doubt
i
murmured
with
ambiguous
suavity
he
scowled
puzzled
at
my
smile
naval
officers
commanded
my
first
ship
before
you
were
born
before
i
had
need
of
a
razor
more
third
owner
in
this
clipper
and
discretion
over
my
course
the
skipper
who
carries
the
first
cargo
out
of
a
japanese
port
is
going
to
get
the
cream
and
an
idee
the
japs
are
loosening
up
a
bit
going
to
put
into
kagoshima
bay
where
the
old
tried
to
land
the
castaway
japs
in
was
fired
upon
most
savagely
by
the
soldiers
of
the
prince
of
satsuma
i
replied
not
try
nagasaki
deshima
he
rumbled
no
dutchman
or
yellow
chinee
to
be
treated
like
a
dog
more
too
far
up
the
west
coast
no
chance
kagoshima
that
satsuma
king
or
mandarin
whatever
he
is
may
have
changed
his
mind
since
the
or
there
may
be
a
new
one
now
with
more
liberal
resolved
upon
it
skipper
i
must
confess
i
have
reasons
of
my
own
to
be
pleased
with
your
plan
i
said
and
at
his
interested
glance
i
told
him
somewhat
in
detail
of
my
daring
ancestor
will
adams
the
first
englishman
ever
to
reach
the
land
of
the
rising
sun
and
the
only
european
ever
made
a
japanese
noble
married
a
japanese
wife
and
left
children
by
her
commented
downing
and
he
grinned
broadly
must
ask
leave
for
you
to
land
and
look
up
your
heathen
forget
yourself
sir
i
caught
him
up
kind
enough
hereafter
to
refrain
from
impertinence
when
speaking
of
persons
related
to
he
stared
in
astonishment
be
durned
two
hundred
years
and
more
since
your
forefather
died
you
said
the
less
i
insisted
sharply
cousins
are
my
cousins
sir
if
there
are
any
of
my
japanese
descendants
now
living
they
are
related
to
me
however
remote
may
be
the
degree
therefore
they
are
entitled
to
be
spoken
of
with
swan
he
muttered
offence
i
bowed
my
acceptance
of
his
uncouth
apology
but
maintained
my
dignity
i
have
said
sir
my
ancestor
was
ennobled
by
the
great
emperor
iyeyasu
heathen
or
not
rest
assured
that
his
japanese
descendants
if
any
survive
are
at
the
least
doubt
no
doubt
he
grunted
soon
have
a
chance
to
inquire
going
to
take
my
ship
up
kagoshima
bay
fog
shine
or
he
turned
on
his
heel
and
ordered
the
helmsman
to
put
the
head
due
east
i
went
below
in
a
glow
of
pleasant
anticipation
there
was
no
mistaking
the
look
in
face
nothing
could
now
shake
his
stubborn
resolve
i
was
to
see
the
mysterious
cipango
of
marco
polo
and
mendez
pinto
the
iappan
of
my
ancestor
the
land
that
for
almost
two
and
a
half
centuries
had
shut
itself
in
from
all
communication
with
the
wide
world
other
than
through
the
severely
restricted
trade
with
the
dutch
and
chinese
at
nagasaki
chapter
ii
in
kagoshima
bay
dawn
of
the
third
day
found
us
ten
miles
off
the
north
shore
of
the
small
volcanic
island
that
stands
second
in
the
entrance
to
van
diemen
strait
the
lurid
glare
reflected
from
its
crater
into
the
ascending
clouds
of
smoke
had
served
as
a
beacon
during
the
last
hours
of
darkness
daylight
confirmed
the
calculations
of
our
position
by
the
sight
of
the
beautiful
smoking
cone
of
peak
lying
or
thirty
miles
to
the
northeast
on
the
southern
extremity
of
satsuma
and
the
rugged
peninsula
of
osumi
ending
in
the
sharp
point
of
cape
satanomi
a
like
distance
to
the
eastward
the
moment
our
landfall
was
clear
in
the
growing
light
the
came
around
and
headed
straight
between
the
two
peninsulas
a
run
of
three
hours
before
the
monsoon
over
the
bluest
of
seas
brought
us
well
up
into
the
entrance
of
kagoshima
bay
with
peak
a
few
miles
off
on
the
port
beam
and
the
bold
verdant
hills
of
osumi
to
starboard
close
along
each
shore
the
sea
broke
on
rocks
but
the
broad
channel
showed
no
signs
of
reefs
or
shoals
and
downing
stood
boldly
in
without
shortening
sail
having
none
of
the
responsibility
of
navigating
the
ship
i
was
able
to
loll
upon
the
rail
and
enjoy
to
the
utmost
the
magnificent
scenery
of
the
bay
on
either
shore
the
mountainous
coast
trended
off
to
the
northward
an
emerald
setting
to
the
sapphire
bay
with
the
lofty
broken
peak
of
a
smoking
volcano
towering
precipitously
at
the
head
of
the
stretch
of
waters
far
inland
still
loftier
peaks
cast
dim
outlines
through
the
summery
haze
every
valley
and
sheltered
along
the
bay
showed
heavy
growths
of
pines
and
other
trees
among
which
were
scattered
groups
of
cottages
many
of
the
slopes
were
under
cultivation
and
terraced
far
up
towards
the
crests
while
every
cove
was
fringed
with
the
straggling
hovels
of
a
fishing
village
in
every
direction
the
bay
was
dotted
with
the
square
white
sails
of
fishing
smacks
and
small
junks
vessels
that
differed
from
chinese
craft
in
the
absence
of
bamboo
ribs
to
the
sails
and
still
more
in
the
presence
of
the
yawning
port
which
gaped
in
their
sterns
i
concluded
that
this
extraordinary
build
was
due
to
the
japanese
policy
of
keeping
the
population
at
home
for
certainly
none
but
a
madman
could
have
dreamed
of
undertaking
any
other
than
a
coastwise
cruise
in
one
of
these
unseaworthy
vessels
another
peculiarity
was
that
not
one
of
the
craft
showed
a
trace
of
paint
the
majestic
apparition
of
the
in
their
secluded
haven
seemed
to
fill
the
japanese
sailors
with
wildest
panic
one
and
all
their
craft
scattered
before
her
like
flocks
of
startled
waterfowl
for
the
most
part
running
inshore
for
shelter
at
the
nearest
villages
or
behind
the
verdant
islets
that
rose
here
and
there
above
the
rippling
blue
waters
a
few
stood
up
the
bay
probably
to
spread
the
alarm
but
the
clipper
easily
overhauled
and
passed
the
swiftest
by
noon
though
the
wind
had
fallen
to
a
light
breeze
we
had
sailed
some
thirty
miles
up
the
bay
and
were
within
three
miles
of
the
volcano
which
stood
out
apparently
on
an
island
with
a
deep
inlet
running
in
on
either
side
on
the
satsuma
shore
across
the
mouth
of
the
western
inlet
our
glasses
had
long
since
brought
to
view
the
gray
expanse
of
kagoshima
rising
to
a
walled
hill
crowned
with
large
buildings
whose
quaint
curved
roofs
and
pagoda
towers
recalled
china
all
along
the
bay
shores
great
bells
were
booming
the
alarm
and
crowds
of
people
rushed
about
the
villages
in
wild
disorder
while
the
junks
and
smacks
continued
to
fly
before
us
as
if
we
were
pirates
smiling
grimly
at
the
commotion
raised
by
his
daring
venture
downing
shortened
sail
and
stood
into
the
opening
of
the
western
inlet
until
we
could
make
out
clearly
with
the
naked
eye
the
general
features
of
the
city
and
its
citadel
so
far
the
lead
had
given
us
from
forty
to
eighty
fathoms
when
we
found
thirty
fathoms
with
good
holding
ground
downing
decided
that
caution
was
the
better
part
of
curiosity
and
gave
orders
to
let
go
anchor
hardly
had
we
swung
about
to
our
cable
when
a
large
boat
bore
down
upon
us
from
the
city
with
the
boldness
of
a
hawk
swooping
upon
a
swan
the
little
craft
was
driven
by
the
long
sculls
of
a
number
of
naked
brown
oarsmen
in
the
stern
amidships
and
forward
swarmed
twenty
or
thirty
soldiers
clad
in
fantastic
armor
of
brass
and
lacquered
leather
and
bearing
antique
muskets
and
matchlocks
in
the
stern
of
the
fluttered
a
small
flag
with
the
design
of
a
circled
white
cross
while
from
the
staff
on
the
prow
a
great
tassel
of
silky
filaments
trailed
down
almost
to
the
surface
of
the
water
beneath
the
tassel
stood
two
men
with
robes
of
gray
silk
and
hats
tied
to
their
chins
with
bows
of
ribbon
i
should
have
taken
them
for
priests
had
not
each
carried
a
brace
of
swords
thrust
horizontally
through
his
belt
at
a
sign
from
the
older
of
these
officers
the
boat
drove
in
alongside
the
starboard
quarter
as
downing
and
i
stepped
to
the
rail
and
gazed
down
upon
them
the
younger
officer
flung
aboard
a
bamboo
stick
that
had
been
cleft
at
one
end
to
hold
a
piece
of
folded
paper
downing
spun
about
to
pick
up
the
message
but
i
calling
to
mind
the
reputed
courtesy
of
the
japanese
was
seized
with
a
whim
to
test
their
reputation
in
this
respect
and
bowed
profoundly
to
the
officers
addressing
them
with
oriental
gravity
permit
me
to
request
you
to
come
aboard
and
favor
me
with
your
company
at
together
the
two
swordsmen
returned
my
bow
slipping
their
hands
down
their
thighs
to
their
knees
and
bending
until
their
backs
were
horizontal
after
a
marked
pause
they
straightened
their
olive
faces
aglow
with
polite
smiles
and
the
younger
man
astonished
me
by
replying
in
distinct
though
oddly
accented
english
sir
thangs
no
yes
you
wait
before
i
could
answer
his
companion
muttered
what
seemed
to
be
a
grave
remonstrance
he
was
replying
in
tones
as
liquid
and
musical
as
italian
when
downing
swung
back
beside
me
here
adams
he
grumbled
thrusting
out
a
sheet
of
crinkly
yellow
paper
like
their
heathen
impudence
i
hastened
to
read
the
message
which
was
written
in
the
chinese
manner
with
an
instead
of
a
quill
but
the
words
were
in
english
as
legible
and
brief
as
they
were
to
the
point
bring
our
people
shipwrecked
yes
take
them
nagasaki
you
come
trade
yes
go
cannon
downing
scowled
upon
the
bizarre
soldiers
and
their
commanders
with
contemptuous
disapproval
and
pointing
to
the
message
bawled
roughly
there
you
yellow
heathen
this
any
way
to
treat
a
peaceful
merchantman
must
take
us
for
the
younger
officer
looked
up
with
his
polite
smile
and
asked
in
a
placid
tone
come
why
of
course
what
else
you
reckon
you
go
nagasaki
growled
downing
me
for
a
dutchman
you
put
back
fast
as
you
can
paddle
and
tell
your
mandarin
or
whatever
he
calls
himself
that
an
american
clipper
lying
in
his
harbor
ready
to
buy
or
barter
for
tea
chinaware
or
you
go
nagasaki
you
go
nagasaki
reiterated
the
officer
smiling
more
politely
than
ever
and
signing
us
down
the
bay
with
a
graceful
wave
of
his
small
fan
get
things
aboard
you
go
nagasaki
ships
no
can
easy
cured
replied
downing
your
mandarin
get
under
way
first
thing
and
run
in
close
as
our
draught
will
let
us
if
we
come
his
bund
we
can
lighter
cargo
in
the
officers
exchanged
quick
glances
and
the
younger
one
repeated
his
affable
order
with
unshaken
placidity
go
nagasaki
without
waiting
for
further
words
both
bowed
and
the
older
one
signed
to
the
scullers
with
his
fan
the
men
thrust
off
and
brought
their
graceful
craft
about
with
admirable
dexterity
again
their
officers
bent
low
in
response
to
my
parting
bow
and
the
long
sculls
sent
the
boat
skimming
cityward
across
the
sparkling
water
at
racing
speed
downing
nodded
after
them
and
permitted
his
hard
mouth
to
relax
in
a
half
grin
the
way
to
talk
to
heathen
adams
no
begging
favors
just
offer
to
trade
see
at
this
moment
the
impatient
steward
announced
dinner
and
we
hastened
below
with
appetites
sharpened
by
pleasant
anticipations
the
more
we
discussed
the
courteous
speech
and
manners
of
our
visitors
the
more
we
became
convinced
that
they
had
meant
nothing
by
their
notice
to
leave
but
would
soon
return
with
a
cordial
assent
to
our
proposals
to
our
surprise
the
afternoon
wore
away
without
a
second
visit
either
from
the
or
any
other
craft
junk
after
junk
and
scores
of
fishing
smacks
sailed
past
us
cityward
but
all
alike
held
off
beyond
hail
still
more
noteworthy
was
the
fact
that
no
vessel
came
out
of
the
inlet
or
across
from
the
city
at
last
shortly
before
sunset
we
sighted
four
armed
with
swivels
bearing
down
upon
us
from
the
nearest
point
of
the
city
our
first
thought
was
that
we
were
to
be
attacked
as
wantonly
as
had
been
the
and
other
ships
that
had
sought
to
open
communication
with
the
japanese
but
at
half
a
length
they
veered
to
starboard
and
began
to
circle
around
the
in
line
ahead
forming
a
cordon
it
was
not
difficult
to
divine
that
their
purpose
was
to
prevent
us
from
making
any
attempt
at
landing
that
they
intended
to
maintain
their
patrol
throughout
the
night
became
evident
to
me
when
after
lingering
over
two
bottles
of
my
choice
madeira
with
the
skipper
i
withdrew
from
the
to
my
stateroom
the
cabin
air
being
close
and
sweltering
and
my
blood
somewhat
heated
from
the
wine
i
turned
down
my
reading
lamp
and
leaned
out
one
of
my
stern
windows
refreshed
by
the
cool
puffs
of
the
night
breeze
that
came
eddying
around
the
quarters
as
she
rocked
gently
on
a
slight
swell
i
soon
began
to
heed
my
surroundings
with
all
the
alertness
of
a
sailor
in
a
hostile
port
the
night
was
moonless
and
partly
overcast
but
the
pitch
darkness
served
only
to
make
clearer
the
beacon
fires
which
blazed
along
the
coast
so
far
as
my
circle
of
vision
extended
no
beacons
had
been
fired
immediately
about
kagoshima
but
the
city
was
aglow
with
a
soft
illumination
of
sufficient
radiance
to
bring
out
the
black
outlines
of
the
whenever
they
passed
between
me
and
the
shore
in
their
slow
circling
of
the
ship
the
booming
of
the
bells
however
had
ceased
and
the
only
sounds
that
broke
the
hot
damp
stillness
of
the
night
were
the
lapping
of
ripples
alongside
and
the
low
creaking
of
the
rigging
an
hour
passed
and
i
still
lolled
half
out
of
my
window
puffing
a
manila
cheroot
when
i
heard
a
slight
splash
directly
below
me
it
was
a
sound
such
as
might
be
made
by
a
leaping
fish
but
in
eastern
waters
life
often
depends
on
instant
vigilance
against
treachery
i
drew
back
on
the
second
to
grasp
a
revolver
and
extinguish
the
lamp
within
half
a
minute
i
was
back
again
at
my
window
peering
warily
down
into
the
blackness
under
the
stern
there
seemed
to
be
a
blot
on
the
phosphorescent
water
you
are
i
said
in
a
low
tone
off
until
daylight
or
i
will
the
response
was
an
unmistakable
sigh
of
relief
followed
by
an
eager
whisper
honorable
foreigner
only
one
man
almost
at
the
first
word
i
knew
that
my
visitor
was
the
younger
officer
of
the
come
alone
i
demanded
for
still
honorable
foreigner
he
cautioned
slipped
through
the
on
a
secret
visit
i
whispered
curiosity
fast
overcoming
my
caution
do
you
come
go
in
ship
honorable
sir
england
five
continents
go
no
stop
in
boat
to
pay
gold
for
a
moment
astonishment
held
me
mute
who
had
ever
before
heard
of
a
japanese
voluntarily
leaving
his
own
shores
many
as
had
been
picked
up
by
whalers
and
clippers
in
the
neighboring
seas
i
knew
of
no
instance
where
the
rescued
men
had
not
been
either
wrecked
or
blown
too
far
out
to
sea
to
be
able
to
navigate
their
miserable
junks
into
a
home
port
the
thought
flashed
upon
me
that
the
man
might
be
a
criminal
only
the
strongest
of
motives
could
have
impelled
him
to
seek
to
break
the
inflexible
law
of
his
country
against
foreign
travel
but
the
memory
of
his
smiling
face
was
against
the
supposition
of
guilt
he
broke
in
upon
my
hesitancy
with
an
irresistible
appeal
you
no
take
me
one
year
i
wait
to
board
a
black
ship
and
go
the
five
by
i
answered
drop
you
a
line
but
bear
in
mind
no
treachery
or
blow
you
to
kingdom
come
sir
he
murmured
in
a
tone
of
such
surprise
and
reproach
as
to
sweep
away
my
last
doubt
having
no
line
handy
i
whipped
the
bedclothes
from
my
berth
and
knotted
the
silken
coverlet
to
one
of
the
stout
linen
sheets
the
latter
i
made
fast
to
a
handle
of
my
and
lowered
the
coverlet
through
the
cabin
window
exposing
outboard
as
little
as
possible
of
the
white
sheet
by
i
whispered
downward
your
in
a
moment
i
felt
a
gentle
tugging
at
the
end
of
the
line
followed
by
a
soft
murmur
sir
pleased
to
though
puzzled
i
hauled
in
on
the
line
to
which
something
of
light
weight
had
been
made
fast
the
mystery
was
soon
solved
the
end
of
the
line
brought
into
my
grasp
two
longish
objects
a
touch
told
me
they
were
sheathed
swords
my
visitor
had
proved
his
faith
by
first
sending
up
his
weapons
i
cleared
the
line
and
dropped
it
down
again
with
a
cordial
word
of
invitation
aboard
can
you
climb
climb
he
whispered
back
there
was
a
short
pause
and
then
the
line
taughtened
he
came
up
with
seamanlike
quickness
and
agility
his
form
appeared
dimly
below
me
as
he
swung
up
hand
over
hand
i
reached
out
and
helped
him
draw
himself
in
through
the
window
pushing
him
aside
i
sought
to
jerk
in
my
line
it
taughtened
with
a
heavy
tug
this
i
exclaimed
made
fast
to
your
boat
it
should
have
been
cast
loose
is
he
replied
with
unfailing
suavity
line
is
fast
i
retorted
i
felt
his
hands
on
the
sheet
and
he
leaned
past
me
out
of
the
window
dunnage
of
course
i
muttered
and
regretful
of
my
impatience
i
fell
to
hauling
with
him
one
good
heave
cleared
our
load
from
the
boat
which
was
left
free
to
drift
up
the
harbor
with
wind
and
tide
the
thought
that
it
might
be
sighted
and
overhauled
by
the
patrol
quickened
my
pull
at
the
line
a
few
more
heaves
brought
up
to
the
window
a
cylindrical
bundle
or
bale
which
the
japanese
grasped
and
drew
inboard
before
i
could
lend
a
hand
my
visitor
was
aboard
dunnage
and
all
and
so
far
as
i
could
tell
he
had
not
been
detected
either
by
the
men
of
the
or
the
watch
above
us
on
the
poop
chapter
iii
the
gentleman
with
two
swords
for
a
full
i
leaned
out
listening
intently
no
alarm
broke
the
peaceful
stillness
of
the
night
i
closed
the
window
and
drew
the
curtains
having
carefully
covered
the
panes
i
struck
a
lucifer
match
and
crossed
over
to
light
my
large
swinging
lamp
three
more
steps
brought
me
to
the
stateroom
door
which
i
locked
and
bolted
turning
about
as
the
lamp
flamed
up
to
full
brightness
i
saw
my
guest
standing
well
to
one
side
of
the
window
his
narrow
oblique
eyes
glancing
about
the
room
with
intense
yet
curiosity
his
dress
was
far
different
from
what
it
had
been
aboard
the
in
place
of
the
baggy
trousers
and
flowing
robes
of
silk
his
body
was
now
scantily
covered
with
a
garment
of
coarse
blue
cotton
and
his
legs
were
wound
about
with
black
leggings
of
still
coarser
stuff
on
his
feet
were
straw
sandals
secured
only
with
a
leather
thong
that
passed
between
the
great
and
second
toes
his
bare
head
gave
me
my
first
chance
to
view
at
close
quarters
the
curious
fashion
in
which
after
the
manner
of
his
country
his
hair
was
shaved
off
from
brow
to
nape
and
the
side
locks
twisted
together
and
laid
forward
on
the
crown
in
a
small
gun
hammer
cue
all
this
i
took
in
at
a
glance
as
i
turned
back
towards
him
meeting
my
gaze
he
beamed
upon
me
with
a
grateful
smile
and
bowed
far
over
sliding
his
hands
down
his
thighs
to
his
knees
in
the
peculiar
manner
i
had
observed
when
he
was
aboard
the
not
to
be
outdone
in
politeness
i
bowed
in
response
aboard
the
sir
pray
be
at
the
word
he
dropped
to
what
seemed
to
be
a
most
uncomfortable
posture
on
his
knees
and
heels
that
i
protested
and
i
pointed
to
a
cushioned
locker
a
he
shook
his
head
smilingly
and
replied
in
an
odd
dutch
dialect
as
inverted
as
his
english
but
far
more
fluent
that
he
was
quite
comfortable
well
i
said
in
the
same
language
us
become
acquainted
i
am
worth
adams
of
south
carolina
lately
resigned
from
the
navy
of
the
united
he
questioned
i
bowed
and
catching
up
from
under
the
window
his
curved
long
sword
and
straight
short
sword
or
dirk
i
presented
them
to
him
by
the
sheaths
he
waved
them
aside
bowing
and
smiling
in
evident
gratification
at
my
offer
i
insisted
he
clasped
his
hands
before
him
palm
to
palm
in
a
gesture
of
polite
protest
i
drew
back
and
hung
the
weapons
on
the
wall
rack
that
held
my
service
sword
he
flung
himself
across
beside
his
bale
of
dunnage
and
plucked
at
the
lashings
as
i
turned
to
him
he
unrolled
the
oiled
paper
in
which
the
bundles
were
wrapped
the
contents
opened
out
in
a
veritable
curio
shop
of
oriental
articles
there
were
three
or
four
pairs
of
straw
sandals
two
pairs
of
lacquered
clogs
a
folding
fan
a
bundle
of
crinkly
paper
a
tiny
pipe
two
or
three
small
cases
a
black
mushroom
hat
of
lacquered
paper
and
a
number
of
robes
toed
socks
and
other
garments
all
of
silk
and
some
exquisitely
embroidered
in
gold
thread
and
colors
from
the
midst
of
one
of
the
silken
heaps
he
uncovered
a
sword
whose
hilt
and
scabbard
were
alike
decorated
with
gold
dragons
straightening
on
his
knees
he
held
the
weapon
out
to
me
his
face
beaming
with
grateful
friendship
wort
woroto
honorable
gift
i
exclaimed
can
not
accept
so
splendid
a
gift
from
he
murmured
in
an
apologetic
tone
and
holding
the
sword
with
the
edge
towards
himself
and
the
hilt
to
his
left
he
slowly
drew
it
out
until
two
or
three
inches
of
the
blade
showed
between
the
twisted
dragon
of
the
guard
and
the
lip
of
the
scabbard
pointing
first
to
the
mark
running
down
the
length
of
the
blade
and
then
to
a
chinese
letter
near
the
guard
he
explained
persuasively
masamune
him
more
reason
why
i
should
refuse
such
a
gift
i
insisted
he
rose
to
his
feet
and
bowed
with
utmost
dignity
him
take
low
down
yoritomo
me
honorable
son
high
honorable
owari
same
shogun
your
father
a
brother
of
the
shogun
of
your
emperor
he
stood
a
moment
pondering
cousin
he
replied
mean
your
father
and
the
shogun
are
cousins
he
nodded
and
again
held
out
the
sword
him
pleasure
i
responded
and
i
accepted
the
gift
as
freely
as
it
was
offered
a
cousin
of
the
emperor
of
japan
should
be
well
able
to
afford
even
such
extravagant
gifts
as
this
beautiful
weapon
thanks
i
cried
and
i
half
turned
to
bare
the
sword
in
the
full
light
of
the
lamp
though
of
a
shape
entirely
novel
to
me
the
thick
narrow
blade
balanced
perfectly
in
my
grasp
being
neither
tall
nor
robust
i
found
it
rather
heavy
and
the
length
of
the
hilt
convinced
me
that
it
was
intended
to
be
used
as
a
sword
by
the
slightly
built
japanese
i
presented
it
hilt
foremost
to
yoritomo
show
me
sir
how
you
hold
he
stared
at
me
in
a
bewildered
manner
i
repeated
my
request
and
thrust
the
hilt
into
his
hand
after
a
hesitancy
which
i
mistook
for
confusion
he
reached
for
the
scabbard
as
well
sheathed
the
sword
and
thrust
it
into
his
narrow
cotton
sash
when
he
turned
to
kneel
beside
his
dunnage
i
flushed
with
anger
at
what
i
took
to
be
a
deliberate
refusal
of
my
request
he
rose
with
a
wooden
chopstick
in
his
hand
politely
waving
me
to
one
side
he
stepped
out
into
the
clear
centre
of
the
stateroom
and
bent
to
set
the
chopstick
upright
on
the
floor
even
had
the
ship
been
motionless
i
doubt
if
he
could
have
made
the
little
piece
of
wood
stand
on
end
for
more
than
a
fraction
of
a
second
yet
having
placed
it
in
position
he
suddenly
freed
it
and
sprang
back
to
strike
a
blow
with
the
sword
direct
from
the
sheath
with
amazing
swiftness
the
chopstick
caught
by
the
blade
before
it
could
topple
over
was
clipped
in
two
across
the
middle
in
a
twinkling
the
blade
was
back
in
its
sheath
dieu
i
gasped
is
swordsmanship
i
held
out
my
hand
to
him
impulsively
he
bowed
and
placed
the
sword
on
my
palm
the
splendid
fellow
did
not
know
the
meaning
of
a
handshake
much
to
his
astonishment
i
caught
his
hand
and
gave
it
a
cordial
grip
i
addressed
him
in
my
best
dutch
inverting
it
as
best
i
could
to
resemble
his
own
dialect
dear
sir
you
wish
to
see
the
world
you
shall
travel
as
my
he
caught
up
one
of
his
lacquer
cases
and
opened
it
to
my
view
within
it
lay
a
few
dozen
oval
gold
coins
hardly
more
than
enough
to
have
paid
his
passage
to
new
york
there
could
be
no
doubt
that
he
had
vastly
underestimated
the
purchasing
value
of
his
coins
in
foreign
lands
he
explained
in
his
quaint
dutch
punishment
for
exchanging
money
with
foreigners
is
death
so
also
it
is
death
to
leave
dai
nippon
i
can
die
but
will
never
kill
a
cousin
of
their
emperor
he
smiled
will
be
welcome
if
i
can
first
bring
to
my
country
a
better
knowledge
of
the
peoples
and
their
even
an
adams
of
south
carolina
might
well
be
proud
to
act
as
cicerone
to
an
oriental
prince
yet
i
believe
i
was
actuated
more
by
the
subtle
sympathy
and
instinctive
understanding
that
was
already
drawing
me
to
him
despite
the
barriers
of
alien
blood
and
thought
and
language
which
lay
between
us
up
your
gold
i
said
will
have
no
need
for
it
i
am
wealthy
and
free
from
all
ties
you
shall
travel
with
me
and
see
the
world
as
my
he
caught
my
meaning
with
the
intuition
of
a
thorough
gentleman
and
his
black
eyes
flashed
me
a
glance
of
perfect
comprehension
he
laid
down
the
box
of
coins
and
took
up
one
of
the
silken
garments
with
an
apologetic
gesture
at
the
coarse
dress
he
was
wearing
i
shook
my
head
i
said
been
no
outcry
from
the
so
sure
i
can
stow
you
away
until
we
are
clear
of
your
country
but
it
will
be
best
to
disguise
you
to
guard
against
any
chance
glimpse
more
the
sooner
you
don
occidental
clothes
the
better
if
you
wish
to
avoid
annoyance
from
the
rudeness
of
our
shipmates
perhaps
an
inch
the
shorter
otherwise
we
are
about
of
a
build
and
a
while
speaking
i
proceeded
to
haul
out
three
or
four
suits
from
my
lockers
and
signed
him
to
take
his
pick
the
gesture
was
more
intelligible
to
him
than
my
words
he
bowed
smiled
and
chose
the
least
foppish
of
the
suits
i
laid
out
my
lightest
slippers
a
tasselled
linen
et
cetera
and
drew
his
attention
to
the
conveniences
of
a
washstand
he
took
up
and
smelled
the
small
cake
of
perfumed
soap
and
was
about
to
try
his
flashing
teeth
upon
it
when
i
showed
him
its
use
by
washing
my
hands
at
this
his
smile
brightened
into
delight
and
casting
loose
his
girdle
he
dropped
his
short
robe
from
him
as
one
would
fling
off
a
cloak
the
leggings
and
sandals
followed
the
robe
and
he
stood
before
me
nude
yet
unabashed
his
lithe
figure
like
a
statue
of
gold
bronze
fortunately
i
was
too
well
acquainted
with
the
peculiar
variations
of
etiquette
and
manners
exhibited
by
the
different
peoples
of
the
east
and
west
to
betray
my
astonishment
at
this
exposure
i
poured
him
the
bath
for
which
he
seemed
so
eager
and
politely
excused
myself
with
the
explanation
that
i
must
provide
him
with
refreshments
as
i
had
my
own
private
larder
in
the
second
stateroom
i
had
no
need
to
call
upon
the
steward
for
a
luncheon
having
on
hand
various
sweets
potted
meats
english
biscuits
and
chinese
conserves
in
addition
to
my
wines
when
i
returned
with
a
tray
i
found
my
guest
struggling
to
don
his
linen
over
his
coat
his
relief
was
unmistakable
when
i
signed
him
to
lay
aside
everything
and
slip
on
a
loose
following
my
example
he
seated
himself
at
the
little
folding
table
when
served
he
waited
seemingly
reluctant
to
eat
alone
accordingly
i
served
myself
and
fell
to
without
delay
at
my
first
mouthful
he
also
caught
up
knife
and
fork
and
began
to
eat
with
undisguised
heartiness
yet
with
a
nicety
and
correctness
of
manners
that
astonished
me
when
i
expressed
my
surprise
that
our
table
etiquette
should
be
so
similar
he
explained
with
charming
candor
that
he
was
but
copying
my
actions
i
could
not
repress
my
admiration
to
our
friendship
i
said
raising
my
glass
to
him
it
soon
ripen
to
the
mellowness
of
this
i
doubt
if
he
sensed
the
meaning
of
the
words
but
he
raised
his
glass
and
his
face
glowed
with
responsive
pleasure
as
together
we
drank
the
toast
the
act
of
seemed
to
bring
him
still
nearer
to
me
and
as
i
gazed
across
into
his
glowing
face
i
could
almost
forget
our
differences
of
race
in
my
robe
and
his
color
and
the
obliqueness
of
his
eyes
appeared
less
pronounced
and
i
realized
that
in
all
other
respects
his
features
differed
little
from
my
own
true
my
eyes
were
dark
blue
and
his
jet
black
and
though
my
nose
was
rather
low
between
the
eyes
his
was
still
flatter
but
below
their
bridges
our
noses
rose
in
the
same
softly
aristocratic
curve
the
outlines
of
our
faces
were
of
a
like
oval
contour
there
was
a
close
similarity
about
our
mouths
and
chins
and
even
our
eyebrows
curved
with
an
identical
high
and
even
arch
friend
i
said
not
answer
unless
you
feel
free
to
explain
but
i
wonder
that
you
a
relative
of
the
emperor
should
be
compelled
to
start
your
travels
in
this
secret
not
emperor
he
corrected
over
shogun
too
i
travel
incognito
shimadzu
my
friend
i
teach
the
dutch
learning

ways

no

real
me
at
kagoshima
daimio
of

gone
yedo
i
steal

my
would
punish
even
the
prince
of
satsuma
if
they
found
you
had
escaped
from
his
province
my
guest
nodded
old
you
would
leave
the
country
at
the
risk
of
death
his
smile
deepened
into
a
look
of
solemn
joy
i
give
his
broken
dutch
a
fair
translation
soul
is
in
the
eyes
of
woroto
sama
there
is
trust
between
us
i
speak
without
concealment
the
peoples
of
the
west
have
dealt
harshly
with
the
chinese
the
black
ships
have
destroyed
many
forts
and
bombarded
great
cities
i
fear
the
black
ships
may
come
to
devastate
dai
nippon
yet
my
people
know
even
less
of
your
people
than
did
the
chinese
the
dutch
of
deshima
warn
us
to
heed
the
demands
of
the
to
open
our
ports
the
officials
in
control
of
the
shogunate
shut
their
my
lip
curled
english
are
a
nation
of
shopkeepers
and
our
yankees
are
no
less
keen
for
bargains
they
will
never
rest
until
they
have
found
a
market
for
their
wares
in
every
country
on
earth
if
they
can
not
get
into
your
ports
peacefully
sooner
or
later
they
will
break
in
by
then
is
the
truth
he
murmured
amida
butsu
i
ask
only
that
i
may
live
to
bring
back
to
dai
nippon
a
clear
report
of
the
power
and
ways
of
the
could
please
them
more
i
replied
on
me
to
help
you
fulfil
your
noble
mission
he
thanked
me
with
almost
effusive
gratitude
yet
with
a
nobility
of
look
that
dignified
the
oriental
obsequiousness
of
his
words
and
manner
to
cut
short
his
thanks
i
went
out
for
a
second
bottle
of
wine
he
had
drunk
his
share
of
the
first
with
gusto
returning
briskly
i
caught
sight
of
my
face
for
the
first
time
without
its
pleasant
smile
it
was
drawn
and
haggard
with
fatigue
putting
aside
the
wine
i
asked
him
if
he
did
not
wish
to
turn
in
he
signed
that
he
would
lie
down
upon
the
floor
but
i
explained
the
use
of
a
bed
which
seemed
an
absolute
novelty
to
him
and
bundled
him
into
my
berth
before
he
could
protest
he
fell
asleep
almost
as
his
head
sank
upon
the
pillow
i
stowed
his
dunnage
in
a
locker
and
hastened
to
extinguish
the
lamp
and
open
the
window
for
the
room
was
suffocatingly
hot
as
i
leaned
out
of
the
window
i
caught
a
glimpse
of
one
of
the
sculling
leisurely
across
the
belt
of
light
between
the
and
kagoshima
boat
had
evidently
drifted
away
through
their
cordon
undetected
five
minutes
later
i
was
outstretched
on
a
locker
as
fast
asleep
as
my
guest
i
awoke
with
what
i
took
to
be
a
crash
of
thunder
dinning
in
my
ears
but
the
bright
glare
of
sunshine
that
poured
in
through
the
stern
windows
told
of
a
clear
sky
no
less
unmistakable
was
the
loud
shouting
of
commands
on
the
deck
above
me
and
the
sharp
heeling
of
the
ship
to
port
the
was
already
under
way
and
her
crew
piling
on
more
sail
as
swiftly
as
downing
and
his
bucko
mates
could
drive
them
with
volleying
oaths
and
orders
as
i
sprang
to
my
feet
the
explanation
of
the
situation
quickly
came
in
the
barking
roar
of
an
carronade
this
was
my
supposed
thunder
during
the
night
the
satsuma
men
had
either
brought
up
a
or
placed
a
battery
on
the
nearest
point
of
land
and
now
they
had
at
last
opened
fire
on
the
ship
that
refused
to
leave
after
due
warning
i
stared
out
the
nearest
window
and
sighted
our
of
the
night
sculling
along
in
our
wake
not
a
throw
distant
their
gunners
stood
by
the
little
swivels
in
hand
and
the
soldiers
held
their
antique
muskets
trained
upon
us
but
the
firing
was
all
from
the
shore
a
puff
of
smoke
showed
me
where
the
carronade
was
concealed
behind
a
long
stretch
of
canvas
upon
a
point
near
the
lower
end
of
kagoshima
the
ball
plunged
into
the
water
half
a
length
short
of
us
before
the
gunners
could
reload
the
drew
off
on
the
starboard
tack
with
swiftly
gathering
headway
and
drew
out
of
range
the
crews
of
the
were
for
a
time
able
to
keep
their
swift
craft
close
astern
but
the
ship
once
under
full
sail
soon
began
to
outdistance
her
pursuers
the
purpose
of
the
japanese
became
clear
to
me
when
i
saw
them
lay
down
their
arms
without
giving
over
the
pursuit
they
had
no
desire
to
harm
us
but
were
inflexibly
determined
to
drive
us
out
of
their
port
and
follow
us
they
did
though
long
before
we
had
tacked
down
into
the
mouth
of
the
great
bay
they
were
visible
only
through
a
glass
as
little
black
dots
bobbing
among
the
whitecaps
yoritomo
had
roused
from
his
profound
sleep
as
we
came
about
for
the
first
time
to
tack
off
the
osumi
shore
when
i
had
returned
his
smiling
salute
he
listened
to
my
account
of
our
flight
with
quiet
satisfaction
and
explained
that
since
we
had
not
left
peaceably
the
satsuma
men
were
compelled
to
resort
to
these
forceful
measures
otherwise
their
lord
though
in
yedo
would
be
punished
for
permitting
our
ship
to
remain
in
his
harbor
while
my
guest
then
took
a
morning
bath
i
closed
the
door
between
my
staterooms
and
ordered
the
steward
to
serve
me
a
hearty
breakfast
in
the
vacant
room
when
he
had
gone
i
locked
the
door
and
called
in
yoritomo
whom
i
had
assisted
to
dress
in
his
occidental
garments
thus
attired
and
with
my
over
his
cue
he
might
easily
have
passed
for
an
italian
or
spanish
gentleman
had
it
not
been
for
the
slant
of
his
eyes
after
we
had
breakfasted
we
found
seats
beside
one
of
the
sternports
and
spent
the
morning
viewing
the
receding
scenery
of
the
bay
and
conversing
in
our
inverted
dutch
eager
as
i
was
to
make
inquiries
about
my
friend
and
his
country
he
showed
still
greater
curiosity
regarding
myself
and
the
wide
world
from
which
his
people
had
been
cut
off
for
so
long
a
period
the
result
was
that
by
midday
i
had
told
him
a
vast
deal
and
gathered
in
turn
a
mere
handful
of
vaguely
stated
facts
meantime
the
having
tacked
clear
of
the
mouth
of
the
bay
raced
down
to
cape
satanomi
with
the
full
sweep
of
the
monsoon
abeam
no
less
to
my
gratification
than
my
surprise
yoritomo
proved
to
be
a
good
sailor
and
watched
our
swift
flight
along
the
coast
with
wondering
delight
the
heavy
rolling
of
the
ship
in
the
trough
of
the
sea
affected
him
no
more
than
myself
before
long
we
cleared
the
outjutting
point
of
cape
satanomi
and
veering
to
port
until
upon
an
easy
bowline
drove
due
east
into
the
vast
expanse
of
the
pacific
i
pointed
to
the
craggy
tip
of
the
cape
where
the
breakers
foamed
high
on
the
dark
rocks
and
rose
with
a
wave
of
my
hand
to
dai
nippon
come
downing
will
be
tumbling
below
for
dinner
now
that
we
are
clear
of
land
come
and
meet
the
hairy
yoritomo
bowed
and
with
a
last
glance
at
the
cape
followed
me
out
into
the
passage
we
found
downing
already
at
his
pork
and
beans
but
he
paused
with
knife
in
air
to
stare
at
my
companion
gaping
as
widely
as
did
the
steward
skipper
i
said
me
to
introduce
to
you
my
japanese
cousin
lord
lord
he
spluttered
if
not
the
first
danged
stowaway
i
ever
mistake
i
corrected
invited
the
gentleman
aboard
as
my
guest
for
the
passage
he
will
share
my
staterooms
and
you
are
to
look
to
me
for
his
passage
a
different
matter
adams
grunted
downing
fool
enough
to
i
called
sharply
to
the
steward
a
plate
for
his
chapter
iv
betrothed
as
this
is
not
an
account
of
the
travels
incognito
of
my
friend
yoritomo
i
do
not
propose
to
give
even
a
of
our
trip
to
america
and
our
european
experiences
nor
shall
i
give
the
particulars
of
the
family
dissension
that
estranged
me
from
home
and
to
a
degree
from
my
country
enough
to
say
that
despite
our
incongruous
and
mutually
incomprehensible
mental
worlds
the
autumn
of
found
me
bound
to
my
japanese
and
friend
by
indissoluble
ties
of
sympathy
and
love
strange
and
inverted
as
seemed
many
of
his
ideas
to
our
western
ways
of
thinking
he
had
proved
himself
worthy
of
the
warmest
friendship
and
esteem
considering
this
together
with
my
longing
for
adventure
and
my
freedom
from
all
the
ties
of
family
acquaintance
and
habit
that
bind
a
man
to
his
country
it
will
not
be
thought
extraordinary
that
i
at
last
determined
to
accompany
my
friend
on
his
return
to
japan
my
decision
was
made
at
the
time
when
he
was
spurred
to
redoubled
effort
in
his
studies
of
the
occident
by
the
news
that
the
proposed
american
expedition
to
his
country
was
at
last
approaching
a
consummation
under
the
vigorous
superintendence
of
commodore
perry
it
was
then
my
friend
told
me
with
his
smile
that
should
the
law
be
rigidly
enforced
against
him
upon
his
return
he
would
be
bound
to
a
cross
and
transfixed
with
spears
yet
under
the
menace
of
so
atrocious
a
martyrdom
he
labored
night
and
day
to
complete
his
studies
that
he
might
return
to
his
people
and
guide
them
from
disaster
upon
the
coming
of
the
hairy
the
western
barbarians
few
could
have
resisted
the
inspiration
of
so
lofty
a
spirit
the
contagion
of
such
utter
devotion
and
when
my
friend
was
willing
to
give
all
for
his
country
should
not
i
be
willing
to
do
a
little
for
the
constellation
whose
brightest
star
was
my
own
sovereign
state
the
great
commonwealth
of
south
carolina
after
all
though
president
fillmore
and
commodore
perry
were
yankees
the
flag
was
the
flag
of
the
south
no
less
than
of
the
north
and
i
had
served
under
it
the
purpose
of
the
expedition
was
peaceful
there
flashed
upon
me
a
plan
by
which
i
might
further
the
success
of
the
expedition
and
at
the
same
time
aid
my
friend
in
his
purpose
i
cried
insist
that
you
must
sail
before
the
american
expedition
that
you
must
risk
all
to
reach
yedo
and
advise
your
government
to
welcome
the
fleet
of
my
countrymen
very
well
i
will
no
longer
seek
to
dissuade
you
i
will
go
with
you
and
help
you
persuade
dai
nippon
to
enter
into
friendly
relations
with
he
stared
at
me
startled
and
distressed
worth
they
might
regard
you
as
a
spy
you
would
be
risking
death
all
the
world
i
have
one
friend
and
only
one
i
rejoined
thought
of
parting
from
him
has
been
for
months
a
constant
source
of
anxiety
and
pain
it
is
pleasant
to
be
rid
of
such
distress
i
am
going
with
you
to
his
eyes
widened
almost
to
occidental
roundness
the
pupils
purpling
with
the
intensity
of
his
emotion
thanks
brother
but
it
is
impossible
impossible
the
worst
they
can
only
send
me
packing
in
a
bamboo
cage
to
be
shipped
out
of
nagasaki
by
the
is
the
usual
course
with
wrecked
sailors
but
should
you
go
with
me
they
might
torture
and
execute
you
as
a
with
fleet
in
eastern
waters
i
replied
give
your
government
credit
for
at
least
a
modicum
of
statesmanship
yet
even
supposing
they
lack
all
wisdom
i
choose
to
take
the
risk
there
is
no
room
for
argument
you
are
going
so
am
i
why
sir
an
adventure
such
as
i
have
been
longing
for
all
my
life
you
can
not
turn
me
from
not
i
others
can
and
will
the
are
everywhere
you
could
not
so
much
as
effect
a
you
i
demanded
am
japanese
there
is
a
chance
for
me
to
slip
through
but
you
in
japanese
dress
can
i
not
talk
good
japanese
have
i
not
accustomed
myself
to
your
costume
a
little
more
practice
with
the
chopsticks
and
clogs
eyes
in
all
japan
there
is
to
be
found
no
one
with
round
eyes
of
violet
can
learn
to
squint
and
have
you
not
told
me
of
the
hats
worn
by
your
freelances
the
you
have
said
that
many
japanese
have
faces
no
darker
than
my
own
and
that
brown
hair
is
not
will
risk
your
life
to
come
with
me
he
protested
i
laughed
lightly
have
so
little
to
say
of
your
japanese
ladies
tomo
perhaps
i
wish
to
see
what
they
are
is
a
jest
i
have
told
you
that
our
women
of
noble
families
are
seldom
to
be
seen
by
are
those
others
i
suggested
he
gazed
at
me
in
mild
reproach
not
jest
woroto
i
have
seen
that
you
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
of
the
occident
you
are
not
one
to
dally
with
those
of
the
the
the
artists
they
must
be
is
their
art
to
i
said
sobering
myself
know
it
is
a
rudeness
to
ask
but
pardon
me
are
you
married
there
no
maiden
of
noble
family
he
answered
was
once
a
but
we
men
of
blood
are
supposed
to
despise
such
weakness
since
then
i
have
devoted
my
life
to
that
which
you
so
generously
have
helped
me
to
have
no
desire
ever
to
marry
i
persisted
hold
it
a
duty
to
ancestors
and
families
for
every
young
man
and
maiden
to
marry
he
replied
is
not
as
we
wish
but
as
our
parents
choose
more
than
ten
years
ago
his
highness
the
shogun
arranged
with
my
father
that
i
should
marry
his
daughter
refused
but
of
course
you
were
still
a
mistake
the
arrangement
was
for
the
future
the
maiden
was
then
only
six
years
of
and
ten
years
ago
then
she
is
now
sixteen
a
princess
of
sixteen
tomo
as
as
a
fish
a
princess
of
sixteen
and
you
never
before
so
much
as
hinted
at
your
good
fortune
of
course
she
is
beautiful
he
gazed
at
me
in
patient
bewilderment
over
the
inexplicable
romantic
emotionalism
of
the
is
said
to
be
beautiful
he
replied
calmly
indifferent
can
not
say
i
have
never
seen
her
you
know
that
japanese
ladies
do
not
mingle
with
men
in
your
shocking
chapter
v
the
coasts
of
nippon
at
once
i
set
about
perfecting
myself
in
certain
practices
which
so
far
had
afforded
me
little
more
than
idle
amusement
the
knack
of
holding
on
a
japanese
clog
or
the
lighter
sandal
by
gripping
the
thong
that
passes
between
the
great
toe
and
its
mate
is
not
acquired
at
the
first
trial
or
at
many
to
follow
still
more
difficult
is
the
ability
to
sit
for
hours
crouched
on
knees
and
heels
in
the
japanese
fashion
i
practised
both
feats
with
a
patient
endurance
born
of
intense
desire
yoritomo
had
suffered
as
great
inconvenience
while
learning
to
wear
occidental
dress
and
to
sit
on
chairs
there
were
many
other
accomplishments
hardly
less
irksome
in
which
i
had
to
drill
myself
that
i
might
be
prepared
to
play
the
r√¥le
of
a
japanese
gentleman
for
recreation
between
times
i
devoted
my
odd
hours
to
cutlass
fencing
with
an
expert
and
to
pistol
practice
for
this
last
i
purchased
a
brace
of
lefaucheux
revolvers
which
though
a
trifle
inferior
to
the
colt
in
accuracy
possessed
the
advantage
of
the
metallic
cartridges
the
convenience
and
superiority
of
this
cartridge
over
the
old
style
of
loading
with
loose
charges
of
powder
and
ball
only
need
be
mentioned
to
be
realized
yoritomo
was
so
desirous
of
witnessing
the
outcome
of
president
manipulation
of
politics
that
we
lingered
in
paris
until
the
which
marked
the
fall
of
the
french
republic
and
the
ascension
of
bonaparte
to
the
imperial
throne
as
napoleon
iii
confirmed
by
this
event
in
his
opinion
of
the
instability
violence
and
chicanery
of
occidental
statesmanship
my
friend
announced
his
readiness
to
leave
europe
the
american
packets
had
already
brought
word
of
the
sailing
of
commodore
perry
from
newport
news
on
november
the
as
his
route
to
china
lay
around
the
cape
of
good
hope
there
had
been
no
need
to
hurry
away
on
our
shorter
passage
by
the
peninsular
and
oriental
route
across
the
isthmus
of
suez
and
down
the
red
sea
we
sailed
on
january
the
third
and
confident
of
our
advantage
of
route
stopped
twice
on
our
way
that
yoritomo
might
study
the
administration
of
the
british
east
india
company
in
ceylon
and
india
and
the
dutch
rule
in
java
as
a
result
we
did
not
reach
shanghai
until
the
end
of
april
it
is
in
point
to
mention
that
during
the
voyage
i
gave
my
friend
frequent
lessons
in
western
swordsmanship
and
in
turn
received
as
many
from
him
in
japanese
fence
using
heavy
foils
of
bamboo
though
the
japanese
art
is
without
thrusts
i
was
taught
by
many
a
bruise
that
it
possesses
clever
and
powerful
cuts
at
shanghai
we
found
already
assembled
three
ships
of
the
american
squadron
including
the
huge
steam
frigate
the
commodore
was
expected
to
arrive
soon
from
in
the
my
plan
had
been
to
charter
a
small
vessel
and
run
across
to
the
japanese
coast
where
we
hoped
to
be
able
to
smuggle
ourselves
ashore
and
make
our
way
to
yedo
in
the
disguise
of
priests
owing
however
to
the
alarm
of
the
foreign
settlement
over
the
victories
of
the
taiping
rebels
in
the
vicinity
of
shanghai
there
were
few
vessels
in
port
and
none
open
to
charter
we
were
already
aware
that
under
the
strict
orders
of
the
navy
department
we
could
not
join
the
american
expedition
without
subjecting
ourselves
to
the
fetters
of
naval
discipline
as
a
last
resort
and
in
the
hope
of
gaining
the
assent
of
the
commodore
to
land
us
in
disguise
we
might
have
considered
even
this
humiliating
course
but
the
very
object
of
return
to
his
native
shores
was
to
reach
yedo
and
present
his
case
to
the
government
before
the
arrival
of
the
foreigners
fearful
of
delay
we
hired
a
chinese
escort
and
rode
south
across
country
to
on
the
bay
of
the
port
from
which
the
ten
annual
chinese
junks
sail
to
nagasaki
though
our
escort
did
not
always
manage
to
prevent
their
bigoted
countrymen
from
making
the
journey
disagreeable
for
the
devils
we
reached
our
destination
without
loss
of
life
or
limb
the
vile
treatment
of
the
celestials
was
quickly
forgotten
in
the
graciousness
of
our
welcome
by
the
little
colony
of
japanese
exiles
whom
we
found
located
at
careful
as
was
yoritomo
to
conceal
his
identity
from
his
countrymen
they
at
once
divined
that
he
was
a
man
of
noble
rank
and
invariably
knelt
and
bowed
their
foreheads
to
the
dust
whenever
they
came
into
his
presence
the
merchants
were
greatly
impressed
by
such
deference
on
the
part
of
the
proud
little
men
of
nippon
yet
neither
this
nor
my
gold
enabled
us
to
obtain
passage
on
one
of
their
clumsy
junks
the
five
vessels
of
the
summer
shipment
to
nagasaki
were
not
due
to
sail
before
august
and
the
jabbering
heathen
refused
to
risk
the
extinction
of
their
japanese
trade
either
by
advancing
the
date
of
sailing
or
by
chartering
a
separate
junk
their
unvarying
reply
was
that
no
one
could
land
anywhere
in
japan
without
being
detected
by
the
spies
one
merchant
alone
betrayed
a
slight
hesitancy
over
refusing
us
outright
and
he
after
dallying
with
my
ultimate
offer
for
a
fortnight
at
last
positively
declined
the
risk
i
next
proposed
to
buy
a
junk
and
man
it
with
fishermen
from
the
japanese
colony
but
yoritomo
soon
found
that
not
one
of
the
exiles
dared
return
to
dai
nippon
great
as
was
their
longing
had
now
come
and
gone
hopeless
of
obtaining
aid
from
the
chinese
we
rode
back
overland
to
shanghai
agreed
that
it
would
be
better
to
sail
with
perry
than
after
him
to
our
dismay
we
discovered
that
the
american
squadron
had
sailed
for
the
loo
choo
islands
two
days
before
our
arrival
in
this
darkest
hour
of
our
enterprise
we
chanced
upon
our
golden
opportunity
shortly
after
our
departure
for
a
new
bedford
whaler
the
had
put
into
shanghai
to
replace
a
sprung
foremast
she
was
now
about
to
sail
for
the
straits
of
sangar
bound
for
the
whaling
grounds
east
of
the
kurile
islands
i
met
her
skipper
upon
the
bund
and
within
the
hour
had
closed
a
bargain
with
him
to
land
us
on
the
japanese
coast
within
twenty
miles
of
the
bay
of
yedo
for
this
i
was
to
pay
him
a
thousand
dollars
in
gold
and
pilot
his
ship
through
van
diemen
strait
by
nightfall
yoritomo
and
i
were
aboard
the
with
our
dunnage
and
had
settled
ourselves
in
the
little
stateroom
vacated
by
the
first
mate
we
awoke
at
sunrise
to
find
the
ship
under
way
down
the
to
the
another
sunrise
found
the
whaler
in
blue
water
running
before
the
monsoon
out
across
the
eastern
sea
though
far
from
a
clipper
the
was
no
tub
we
sighted
kuro
the
westernmost
island
of
van
diemen
strait
and
its
blazing
volcanic
neighbor
iwogoshima
on
june
the
second
eight
days
over
a
year
and
nine
months
since
the
bore
me
up
the
superb
bay
of
kagoshima
the
interval
had
been
crowded
with
events
in
our
physical
and
mental
worlds
scarcely
less
momentous
to
myself
than
to
my
friend
but
it
was
no
time
for
me
to
indulge
in
retrospection
i
had
engaged
to
navigate
the
through
the
narrow
waters
of
an
uncharted
strait
the
rainy
season
was
well
under
way
with
all
the
concomitants
of
heavy
squalls
and
dense
fogs
as
already
mentioned
a
lucky
glimpse
of
kuro
soon
confirmed
as
a
landfall
by
the
red
glare
of
iwogoshima
enabled
me
to
set
our
course
to
pass
through
the
strait
we
ran
in
under
reefed
topsails
feeling
our
way
blindly
by
compass
and
log
in
true
whaler
fashion
the
yankees
took
the
risk
as
a
matter
of
course
but
i
between
the
difficulty
of
calculating
the
effects
of
the
capricious
squalls
on
our
headway
and
my
ignorance
of
the
set
of
the
powerful
currents
around
this
southern
extremity
of
japan
found
my
responsibilities
as
pilot
no
light
burden
i
was
correspondingly
relieved
when
a
rift
opened
in
the
smothering
masses
of
vapor
which
shrouded
all
view
of
sea
and
land
and
i
saw
looming
up
abeam
the
point
of
bold
cape
satanomi
once
clear
of
the
strait
out
in
the
open
waters
of
the
pacific
we
packed
on
all
sail
to
outdrive
the
heavy
following
sea
and
entered
upon
the
run
of
over
five
hundred
miles
along
the
southeast
coasts
of
kiushiu
shikoku
and
hondo
the
main
island
though
the
weather
continued
wet
and
foggy
we
were
favored
by
a
half
gale
from
the
south
and
by
the
drift
of
the
japan
current
which
here
flows
little
less
swiftly
than
does
our
gulf
stream
off
hatteras
regardless
of
the
whales
which
we
frequently
sighted
our
skipper
true
to
his
agreement
held
on
under
full
sail
night
and
day
until
we
made
a
landfall
of
cape
idzu
the
southernmost
point
of
the
great
promontory
which
lies
southwest
of
yedo
bay
we
could
not
have
desired
conditions
more
favorable
to
enable
us
to
approach
the
coast
unobserved
night
was
coming
on
and
the
gale
freshening
but
there
was
no
fog
our
skipper
shortened
sail
and
stood
boldly
in
between
the
east
coast
of
idzu
and
the
chain
of
islands
trending
southward
from
the
mouth
of
the
outer
bay
of
yedo
had
the
gale
fallen
at
sundown
i
might
have
persuaded
the
skipper
to
hold
on
across
and
land
us
on
the
west
coast
of
awa
off
the
mouth
of
the
inner
bay
unfortunately
the
wind
moderated
so
little
and
the
sky
became
so
overcast
that
he
ran
in
under
the
lee
of
the
great
hulking
volcano
laid
down
on
the
charts
as
vries
island
but
by
yoritomo
called
oshima
we
were
here
in
the
mouth
of
the
outer
bay
and
the
skipper
stated
that
he
was
prepared
to
fulfil
his
contract
by
landing
us
on
the
island
when
i
protested
against
being
thus
marooned
he
declared
that
he
would
put
us
ashore
on
vries
island
or
nowhere
at
this
i
demanded
that
he
run
up
the
outer
bay
and
set
us
adrift
in
his
gig
he
declared
that
to
do
so
would
be
sheer
murder
since
no
boat
could
outride
the
billows
in
the
open
bay
however
an
offer
of
half
of
japanese
gold
coins
altered
his
opinion
and
the
appearance
of
the
rising
moon
which
began
to
glimmer
at
intervals
through
the
scurrying
clouds
enabled
us
to
persuade
him
that
he
could
run
up
to
within
the
southern
point
of
awa
and
beat
out
again
without
endangering
his
ship
the
moment
he
ordered
the
ship
brought
about
yoritomo
and
i
hastened
to
prepare
ourselves
for
the
landing
by
shifting
into
our
or
robes
which
with
other
articles
of
costume
we
had
obtained
from
the
japanese
at
we
had
been
dressing
each
hair
in
the
japanese
fashion
and
shaving
clean
ever
since
the
passage
of
van
diemen
strait
our
dunnage
was
already
lashed
together
in
two
compact
bundles
wrapped
about
with
many
thicknesses
of
waterproof
oiled
paper
to
the
outside
of
the
bundles
i
now
tied
my
revolvers
and
yoritomo
his
sword
and
dirk
all
alike
wrapped
in
oil
paper
together
with
two
pairs
of
straw
sandals
and
black
leggings
and
our
basket
hats
of
rattan
the
night
was
far
too
wild
for
us
to
risk
being
flung
into
the
breakers
with
any
unnecessary
weight
about
us
that
we
might
not
be
hampered
by
our
loose
dress
we
bound
up
our
long
sleeves
to
our
shoulders
and
tucked
the
skirts
of
the
robes
through
the
back
of
our
girdles
when
we
went
up
on
the
deck
with
our
dunnage
a
gleam
of
moonlight
showed
us
the
dim
smoking
mass
of
vries
island
already
a
full
two
leagues
astern
while
ahead
across
eighteen
miles
or
more
of
racing
billows
loomed
the
mountainous
coast
of
awa
we
made
our
way
along
the
pitching
deck
to
where
the
skipper
stood
with
a
group
of
sailors
beside
the
gig
they
were
lashing
down
a
number
of
empty
water
breakers
in
the
bow
and
stern
and
under
the
thwarts
and
there
was
an
oil
cask
made
fast
to
the
bow
with
a
line
hey
shouted
the
skipper
when
i
made
our
presence
known
by
touching
his
arm
on
your
own
head
sir
doing
my
best
for
you
as
a
christian
but
take
a
sight
of
special
providence
to
bear
you
safe
into
haven
once
you
cut
i
pointed
to
the
oil
cask
drag
keep
you
from
broaching
best
kind
of
drag
full
of
oil
and
the
head
riddled
with
gimlet
holes
the
oil
will
spread
and
keep
the
waves
from
breaking
over
heard
of
that
trick
i
replied
gripping
his
broad
hand
the
gig
is
unsinkable
with
those
breakers
aboard
bound
to
win
through
lash
our
dunnage
in
the
sternsheets
the
moon
went
behind
a
cloud
but
one
of
the
sailors
raised
the
lantern
that
he
was
holding
beneath
the
bulwark
and
set
it
within
the
gig
our
bundles
were
soon
secured
and
we
had
only
to
lean
upon
the
bulwark
and
gaze
over
the
starboard
bow
towards
the
dim
coast
of
awa
though
under
shortened
sail
the
old
ran
before
the
gale
at
so
famous
a
rate
that
within
two
hours
the
outpeeping
moon
showed
us
the
furious
surf
along
the
rocky
coast
two
miles
on
our
starboard
beam
as
agreed
the
skipper
now
put
the
head
to
the
northwest
and
stood
on
across
the
mouth
of
the
inner
bay
until
we
sighted
the
surf
on
the
western
coast
our
time
had
come
chapter
vi
a
wild
night
the
gig
already
hung
outboard
at
the
word
from
the
skipper
yoritomo
sprang
into
the
sternsheets
and
i
into
the
bow
ready
to
cast
off
six
men
stood
by
to
lower
away
and
one
to
cut
loose
our
cask
drag
which
had
been
swung
outboard
in
a
handy
sling
skipper
i
called
aye
good
luck
to
you
sir
he
cried
and
wheeling
about
he
began
bawling
his
orders
to
bring
the
ship
about
on
the
port
tack
i
had
chosen
a
moment
when
the
moon
was
edging
out
through
a
cloud
rift
so
that
the
yankees
had
ample
light
for
their
work
within
half
a
minute
the
ship
already
running
close
aslant
the
waves
came
around
into
the
trough
of
the
sea
over
she
heeled
until
she
was
all
but
lying
on
her
beam
ends
a
little
more
and
she
must
have
turned
turtle
the
sea
boiled
up
alongside
until
the
water
poured
over
the
bulwark
yet
our
men
stood
coolly
to
their
posts
go
the
falls
i
shouted
above
the
howl
of
the
gale
the
gig
splashed
into
the
seething
water
in
an
instant
i
had
cast
loose
the
bow
block
cried
yoritomo
from
the
stern
i
yelled
the
oil
cask
plunged
from
its
severed
sling
as
the
gig
swung
swiftly
down
the
receding
wave
to
the
leeward
of
the
i
caught
one
glimpse
of
the
gallant
old
whaler
staggering
up
and
swinging
her
stem
around
into
the
gale
a
faint
cheer
came
ringing
down
the
wind
then
we
were
out
from
under
her
lee
in
the
full
sweep
of
the
gale
though
i
had
always
prided
myself
upon
my
skill
in
handling
small
craft
i
must
confess
that
the
narrow
gig
would
have
swamped
or
turned
turtle
within
the
first
minute
had
it
not
been
for
our
drag
and
the
breaker
floats
before
we
had
swung
around
to
the
drag
a
comber
broke
over
us
and
filled
our
little
cockleshell
to
the
gunwales
as
she
came
out
of
the
smother
still
afloat
but
heavy
as
a
log
we
fell
to
with
our
bailers
like
madmen
we
now
knew
she
could
not
sink
but
without
freeboard
she
would
not
ride
head
on
to
the
cask
and
the
first
wave
that
caught
us
broadside
might
roll
us
over
fortunately
the
oil
oozing
from
the
cask
was
already
filming
over
the
surface
around
us
so
that
high
as
we
were
flung
up
by
the
racing
billows
and
low
as
we
sagged
into
their
troughs
no
more
crests
broke
upon
us
the
moment
the
boat
rode
easier
i
sprang
upon
a
thwart
and
gazed
about
for
a
parting
glance
of
the
but
the
moon
was
already
covered
by
a
wisp
of
the
scurrying
stormrack
when
its
silvery
rays
again
shone
upon
the
wild
sea
i
fancied
that
i
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
whaler
standing
out
towards
the
open
ocean
on
the
starboard
tack
the
deep
booming
of
surf
on
a
rocky
shore
brought
my
gaze
about
and
as
we
topped
the
next
wave
i
saw
that
we
were
abeam
the
high
cliffs
of
cape
sagami
at
the
western
point
of
the
entrance
to
the
inner
bay
i
swung
aft
into
the
sternsheets
where
yoritomo
crouched
in
the
wash
still
frantically
bailing
i
shouted
he
dropped
his
bailer
and
looked
over
the
side
at
the
shore
in
blank
astonishment
swift
he
cried
swift
wave
and
tide
i
rejoined
known
a
boat
to
make
less
speed
under
sail
only
trouble
with
our
present
bearings
pile
up
on
that
outjutting
point
of
the
east
that
uraga
he
replied
to
chart
drift
clear
of
the
west
coast
and
be
no
out
of
harbor
the
moonlight
they
may
sight
us
he
insisted
mile
offshore
among
these
waves
even
if
they
had
they
could
not
tell
the
gig
from
a
sampan
nor
ourselves
from
fishermen
you
say
the
bay
swarms
with
there
is
now
only
the
danger
of
delay
from
being
cast
up
on
the
east
delay
apt
to
prove
permanent
if
we
drift
upon
a
lee
shore
in
the
surf
running
i
added
know
you
fear
death
as
little
as
i
do
he
said
are
brothers
in
spirit
but
that
my
message
should
be
delayed
or
lost
the
gods
forbid
not
yet
on
the
rocks
tomo
deep
water
and
to
spare
for
a
while
i
cried
springing
up
to
take
our
bearings
as
the
moon
was
again
gliding
behind
the
clouds
we
were
now
well
past
cape
sagami
and
opposite
a
bight
whose
southern
shore
lying
under
the
lee
of
its
cliffs
was
free
of
all
surf
leading
down
through
the
face
of
the
cliffs
from
the
terraced
hillsides
above
were
many
wooded
ravines
at
the
foot
of
which
villages
nestled
upon
bits
of
level
ground
near
the
edge
here
was
a
haven
that
might
possibly
be
gained
by
casting
the
drag
adrift
and
rowing
in
aslant
the
wind
but
it
was
below
uraga
port
of
entry
for
the
native
craft
and
yoritomo
had
impressed
upon
me
the
great
need
to
win
our
way
past
that
nest
of
government
inspectors
and
spies
the
attempt
to
run
under
a
lee
would
be
no
more
desperate
an
undertaking
beyond
uraga
than
here
i
crouched
down
again
beside
my
friend
and
waited
anxiously
for
the
next
glimpse
of
the
moon
but
the
weather
had
suddenly
thickened
gusts
of
rain
began
to
dash
upon
us
out
of
the
blackening
sky
the
rifts
closed
up
until
there
was
not
even
a
star
visible
and
the
rain
increased
until
it
poured
down
aslant
the
gale
in
torrents
the
roar
of
the
pelting
deluge
drowned
the
boom
of
the
surf
and
beat
down
the
wave
crests
we
had
not
even
the
phosphorescent
foam
of
the
combers
to
break
the
inky
darkness
about
us
the
rain
was
too
warm
to
chill
us
but
the
drops
struck
upon
our
bare
limbs
with
the
sting
of
sleet
we
crouched
together
in
the
sternsheets
peering
westward
into
the
thick
of
the
aqueous
murk
in
search
for
the
lights
of
uraga
one
glimpse
would
have
given
us
fair
warning
to
prepare
for
my
desperate
scheme
to
work
under
the
lee
of
the
point
some
two
miles
beyond
death
was
inevitable
should
we
drive
past
that
point
across
the
bend
of
the
bay
to
the
outjutting
cape
on
the
east
shore
nor
was
it
enough
for
us
to
clear
the
cape
even
should
we
escape
destruction
there
and
even
should
we
drift
on
up
into
the
northeast
corner
of
the
bay
across
from
yedo
we
would
no
less
certainly
perish
in
the
surf
on
the
other
hand
could
i
but
win
the
shelter
of
the
point
above
uraga
out
of
the
full
sweep
of
the
seas
i
might
be
able
to
sheer
over
to
the
west
shore
and
gain
the
shelter
of
one
of
the
capes
shown
on
the
chart
drawn
for
me
by
yoritomo
failing
to
sight
the
lights
of
uraga
i
was
in
a
pretty
pickle
to
cut
adrift
from
our
drag
was
quite
sufficiently
hazardous
without
the
certainty
that
if
we
put
in
too
soon
we
should
go
to
wreck
on
the
uraga
cape
and
if
we
held
on
too
late
be
cast
up
on
the
outjutting
point
of
the
east
coast
we
were
utterly
lost
in
the
dense
night
of
whirling
wind
and
rain
and
waves
without
means
to
measure
the
passage
of
time
i
could
not
even
reckon
our
position
by
estimating
our
rate
of
drift
use
watching
tomo
i
at
last
shouted
could
not
see
even
a
lighthouse
so
thick
a
night
and
drifted
past
by
now
hand
me
your
he
replied
and
i
felt
him
turn
about
to
where
his
dunnage
was
lashed
down
in
a
few
minutes
he
turned
back
and
thrust
the
hilt
of
his
short
sword
into
my
hand
he
asked
no
questions
but
waited
calmly
for
me
to
direct
him
with
a
few
touches
of
the
blade
i
cut
loose
the
oars
which
had
been
lashed
under
the
gunwales
as
i
pressed
the
dirk
hilt
back
into
his
hand
i
gave
him
his
orders
forward
and
cut
the
line
when
i
say
then
aft
and
stand
by
to
without
a
word
he
crept
away
towards
the
bows
through
the
deluge
and
blackness
i
followed
to
a
seat
on
the
forward
thwart
and
waited
while
three
of
the
great
billows
flung
us
high
and
dropped
us
into
the
trough
behind
them
as
we
sagged
down
the
slope
of
the
third
i
dipped
my
and
shouted
the
fourth
wave
shouldered
us
skyward
as
we
topped
the
crest
the
feel
of
the
wind
on
my
back
told
me
that
the
head
was
falling
off
to
port
a
quick
stroke
brought
her
back
square
into
the
wind
we
shot
down
the
watery
slope
but
before
we
could
climb
to
another
crest
yoritomo
had
crept
past
me
to
his
post
in
the
pointed
stern
with
utmost
caution
i
headed
the
boat
a
few
points
to
westward
and
began
to
pull
aslant
the
waves
with
the
wind
on
our
port
bow
it
was
a
ticklish
moment
for
i
did
not
know
how
the
gig
would
handle
without
the
drag
of
our
abandoned
cask
she
might
well
be
expected
to
fall
off
into
the
trough
of
the
sea
the
struggle
was
now
on
in
desperate
earnest
but
as
i
bent
to
my
oars
with
all
my
skill
and
strength
i
realized
by
the
way
the
gig
responded
to
my
efforts
that
we
had
at
least
a
fighting
chance
yet
it
was
no
easy
matter
to
hold
the
bows
quarteringly
to
wind
and
waves
as
we
shot
up
and
down
the
dizzy
slopes
and
yoritomo
was
kept
busy
bailing
out
the
water
that
all
too
frequently
poured
in
over
the
rocking
gunwales
at
last
through
the
howling
of
the
gale
and
the
slashing
roar
of
the
rain
on
the
waters
i
heard
a
deeper
note
the
welcome
boom
of
the
surf
on
the
west
shore
whether
we
were
as
yet
abreast
the
cape
above
uraga
i
could
not
tell
but
i
held
on
as
before
regardless
of
whatever
reefs
or
shoals
might
lie
off
this
rocky
coast
soon
the
surf
roar
which
had
sounded
abreast
of
us
seemed
to
fall
away
i
gave
a
shout
and
bent
to
my
oars
with
redoubled
energy
we
were
drifting
past
the
point
out
into
the
turn
of
the
bay
beyond
after
a
or
so
to
my
vast
relief
the
force
of
the
wind
lessened
and
the
waves
ran
lower
we
were
edging
around
the
cape
under
the
high
lee
of
the
westerly
trending
shore
another
and
we
were
in
comparatively
quiet
water
i
called
we
attempt
a
landing
we
can
make
it
with
ease
under
the
shelter
of
the
near
across
the
point
from
uraga
he
answered
we
not
coast
up
the
west
shore
every
mile
we
float
nearer
to
yedo
is
two
miles
of
walking
what
if
we
should
fetch
up
on
a
lee
shore
marked
more
than
one
promontory
on
the
west
farther
out
then
he
said
morning
we
might
drift
all
the
way
up
the
bay
and
across
the
shinagawa
shoals
into
the
mouth
of
the
sumida
to
yedo
i
cried
your
chart
makes
it
less
than
thirty
miles
and
only
a
question
of
holding
the
boat
a
few
points
aslant
the
wind
seen
how
lightly
the
gig
rides
only
the
danger
of
those
promontories
and
the
wind
to
steer
by
do
it
tomo
perry
may
already
be
at
nagasaki
he
added
by
way
of
final
argument
for
haste
me
your
robe
i
said
he
slipped
off
the
loose
garment
without
demur
and
crept
forward
to
press
it
into
my
hand
we
were
now
in
water
in
which
the
boat
could
be
safely
allowed
to
drift
without
guidance
i
flung
the
oars
inboard
and
lashed
the
robe
to
one
of
them
so
as
to
make
a
small
triangular
sail
while
i
worked
i
gave
yoritomo
his
instructions
soon
the
sail
was
ready
i
handed
it
over
to
my
friend
and
with
the
second
oar
for
rudder
made
my
way
aft
to
the
sharp
stern
a
few
strokes
brought
us
around
with
the
wind
on
our
port
quarter
immediately
yoritomo
stepped
his
oar
mast
through
the
socket
in
the
forward
thwart
and
set
sail
though
so
small
the
little
cotton
triangle
drew
well
as
i
could
tell
by
the
ease
with
which
the
gig
responded
to
her
helm
another
proof
was
the
quickness
with
which
we
ran
out
from
under
our
sheltering
highland
into
the
full
sweep
of
the
gale
and
the
high
waves
of
the
open
bay
scudding
aslant
the
wind
as
nearly
north
as
i
could
reckon
our
bearings
from
the
drive
of
the
rain
torrents
we
hurled
along
through
the
black
night
utterly
lost
to
all
sense
of
time
and
distance
after
what
may
have
been
two
hours
or
possibly
three
the
rain
slackened
to
a
fine
drizzle
and
the
wind
began
to
lull
blowing
in
fitful
gusts
and
veering
about
in
a
way
that
left
me
only
the
run
of
the
waves
by
which
to
shape
my
course
soon
after
to
my
surprise
the
great
rollers
began
to
lessen
in
height
clear
proof
that
we
had
come
under
the
lee
of
a
headland
outwearied
by
the
long
struggle
i
decided
to
try
for
the
shelter
which
it
seemed
to
offer
but
before
i
could
give
the
order
to
yoritomo
to
shift
sail
a
roller
broke
aboard
us
filling
the
gig
to
the
gunwales
and
bail
i
yelled
gone
he
shouted
and
he
crawled
aft
with
his
robe
sail
wrapped
about
the
oar
a
second
roller
broke
over
us
we
were
among
breakers
either
upon
a
bank
or
a
shoaling
beach
as
i
labored
to
hold
the
gig
stern
on
to
the
waves
i
cried
out
in
anticipation
of
the
coming
shock
to
your
oar
cut
loose
the
bundles
stand
by
to
pass
me
he
called
back
the
gig
struck
softly
on
a
mud
bottom
and
was
instantly
smothered
under
a
third
breaker
but
the
impact
drove
her
over
the
bank
and
we
found
ourselves
afloat
in
fairly
calm
water
an
attempt
to
pole
with
my
oar
showed
me
that
we
were
in
water
deeper
than
i
could
sound
a
last
puff
of
the
expiring
gale
caught
the
boat
and
swung
her
about
broadsides
before
i
could
bring
her
bows
on
again
she
struck
bottom
on
another
mud
bank
through
the
lessening
drizzle
i
could
see
the
outline
of
a
rising
shore
near
at
hand
the
boat
lifted
in
the
low
swell
that
rolled
over
the
outer
shoal
drove
forward
a
few
yards
and
stuck
fast
a
downward
thrust
of
my
oar
told
me
there
was
hard
bottom
a
foot
below
the
ooze
bundle
and
follow
i
cried
yoritomo
thrust
my
dunnage
into
my
hands
and
leaped
overboard
after
me
ten
yards
through
mud
and
water
brought
us
to
the
foot
of
a
sloping
embankment
we
climbed
up
it
and
stretched
out
upon
its
crest
panting
with
the
fatigue
of
our
long
battle
against
wind
and
wave
yet
aglow
with
delight
at
our
victory
said
yoritomo
after
a
short
rest
rain
has
ceased
i
will
put
on
my
robe
and
lead
you
to
an
inn
or
i
replied
dawn
must
be
near
we
can
not
leave
the
gig
to
be
found
by
the
first
man
who
comes
this
way
we
must
sink
lightened
of
our
weight
the
gig
had
cleared
and
drifted
in
almost
to
the
foot
of
the
embankment
by
rolling
we
sluiced
enough
water
from
her
to
set
her
afloat
and
i
set
about
knocking
out
the
bungs
of
the
breakers
while
yoritomo
fetched
heavy
lumps
of
turf
and
clay
from
a
break
in
the
face
of
the
embankment
as
the
boat
sank
deeper
into
the
water
with
the
filling
of
the
breakers
and
the
weight
of
the
clay
ballast
we
thrust
off
into
deeper
water
at
last
i
was
satisfied
and
shoving
her
out
into
the
channel
between
the
mud
banks
i
rocked
under
the
gunwales
until
she
filled
and
sank
a
few
strokes
brought
me
back
into
shallow
water
and
i
soon
regained
the
embankment
in
the
faintly
gathering
light
i
saw
that
yoritomo
had
already
put
on
not
only
his
robe
but
also
his
leggings
and
sandals
he
thrust
my
hat
and
revolvers
into
my
hands
and
knelt
to
bind
on
my
sandals
and
leggings
clouds
break
he
exclaimed
is
a
good
omen
let
us
hasten
i
said
can
not
go
far
without
we
find
a
farmhouse
or
inn
he
urged
springing
up
he
swung
his
dunnage
upon
his
shoulder
and
led
off
inland
a
few
steps
brought
us
down
the
far
side
of
the
embankment
into
a
shallow
swamp
as
we
splashed
through
the
oozy
slush
i
felt
tufts
of
soft
grassy
stems
brushing
against
my
ankles
at
regular
intervals
field
muttered
my
friend
before
i
could
question
him
the
stench
of
the
strongly
fertilized
paddy
swamp
was
almost
insufferable
and
our
discomfort
was
not
lessened
by
the
maddening
swarms
of
mosquitoes
we
crossed
a
narrow
dyke
and
splashed
along
with
quickened
step
through
a
second
field
worse
than
the
first
still
another
dyke
and
then
beyond
the
third
field
we
sighted
higher
ground
above
which
loomed
the
dimly
outlined
tops
of
gigantic
trees
tokaido
cried
yoritomo
a
hundred
yards
across
the
last
fetid
swamp
brought
us
up
the
bank
and
into
a
broad
smooth
road
beneath
the
dense
gloom
of
a
double
row
of
cryptomerias
we
were
upon
the
famed
tokaido
or
east
sea
road
which
connects
yedo
with
kyoto
and
the
southwestern
provinces
of
japan
to
my
surprise
yoritomo
crossed
over
instead
of
turning
along
the
road
as
i
followed
he
pointed
to
a
wooded
hill
upon
which
a
group
of
lofty
trees
and
the
black
mass
of
a
small
building
stood
out
against
the
brightening
sky
skirting
the
edge
of
the
tokaido
we
soon
came
to
a
path
that
led
us
windingly
around
through
high
coppices
and
up
the
far
slope
of
the
hill
the
last
of
the
clouds
were
now
sweeping
away
to
the
northward
and
the
eastern
sky
was
gray
with
the
pallor
of
the
false
dawn
we
gained
the
round
of
the
hill
and
passed
between
a
pair
of
heavy
wooden
pillars
with
a
square
and
a
massive
or
framework
with
upcurving
ends
muttered
yoritomo
come
to
a
temple
not
an
though
i
caught
a
hint
of
disappointment
in
his
tone
he
led
on
up
the
bend
of
the
hillcrest
and
across
a
shrubbery
to
the
front
of
the
small
building
in
the
midst
of
the
towering
pines
is
a
a
shinto
temple
he
murmured
we
need
food
as
well
as
will
give
us
no
food
when
we
come
as
i
exclaimed
in
mock
indignation
when
a
is
not
deserted
the
priests
of
shinto
seldom
dwell
in
or
near
it
he
replied
and
i
heard
him
sigh
he
was
as
near
outspent
as
myself
but
suddenly
i
saw
his
bent
form
straighten
he
faced
about
to
the
western
sky
with
upraised
arms
and
his
voice
rang
clear
and
strong
in
a
salute
of
reverent
joy
i
turned
to
look
far
away
to
the
beyond
the
black
silhouette
of
broken
mountain
ranges
and
lesser
peaks
a
marvellous
pyramid
of
rosy
flame
towered
high
aloft
in
the
starry
sky
red
dawn
as
yet
unseen
by
us
had
turned
the
crest
of
the
superb
peak
into
the
likeness
of
a
gigantic
blossom
pendent
from
repeated
yoritomo
and
he
fell
upon
his
knees
and
bowed
his
forehead
to
the
ground
overcome
with
rapture
swiftly
the
roseate
effulgence
brightened
and
shifted
hue
to
a
glorious
gold
that
shone
with
dazzling
brightness
against
the
sky
the
eastern
sky
was
now
flaming
high
with
the
red
dawn
lighter
shone
the
great
its
gold
changing
under
the
magic
transmutation
of
day
into
the
cold
burnished
silver
of
its
glistening
snows
the
sun
leaped
above
the
horizon
and
the
last
shadow
of
night
fled
yoritomo
rose
from
his
knees
and
caught
up
his
bundle
within
he
said
can
at
least
rest
and
it
is
well
we
should
not
be
seen
until
we
have
arranged
our
caught
in
the
midst
of
a
yawn
i
signed
assent
and
he
led
me
past
the
stone
image
of
a
sitting
fox
to
the
narrow
entrance
of
the
temple
pushing
in
after
him
with
my
bundle
i
found
myself
in
a
gloomy
chamber
shut
off
from
the
rear
half
of
the
temple
by
a
close
wall
there
was
no
idol
to
be
seen
and
the
only
furnishing
of
the
bare
little
room
was
a
small
mirror
of
polished
bronze
hung
about
with
strips
of
white
paper
yoritomo
kowtowed
before
this
curious
symbol
of
shinto
rose
to
his
knees
and
waved
me
to
lie
down
i
stretched
out
yawning
and
he
sank
down
beside
me
in
another
minute
we
were
both
fast
asleep
chapter
vii
on
the
tokaido
we
wakened
stiff
and
sore
a
full
two
hours
after
noon
yoritomo
who
was
first
to
rouse
up
ran
to
the
door
to
look
out
he
turned
about
with
an
urgent
cry
that
cut
short
my
yawnings
in
the
midst
up
brother
slept
past
midday
we
must
lose
no
time
if
we
expect
to
reach
the
heart
of
yedo
by
you
remember
the
two
biscuits
i
wrapped
in
my
bundle
i
demanded
famished
a
drink
and
a
biscuit
for
me
before
i
take
to
any
road
must
dress
and
eat
there
is
water
outside
he
responded
and
he
slashed
open
our
bundles
not
a
drop
of
water
had
penetrated
the
wrappings
we
slipped
off
our
stained
and
tattered
yamabushi
robes
to
put
on
the
silken
garments
which
he
had
carried
from
his
country
all
the
long
voyage
to
europe
and
back
first
came
a
pair
each
of
the
gorgeous
baggy
trousers
or
they
were
provided
with
side
slits
into
which
we
tucked
the
skirts
of
our
silk
the
narrow
twisted
or
sash
served
to
hold
my
revolvers
and
the
magnificent
masamune
sword
presented
to
me
by
yoritomo
that
eventful
night
in
the
cabin
of
the
my
friend
thrust
his
sword
and
dirk
into
his
girdle
not
in
the
horizontal
japanese
fashion
but
vertically
as
i
wore
mine
that
the
scabbards
might
not
show
beneath
our
outer
robes
his
writing
case
and
the
bag
containing
his
outfit
were
secured
on
the
other
side
by
passing
the
carved
ivory
buttons
of
their
cords
through
a
fold
of
the
girdle
inside
about
my
waist
i
placed
my
twenty
odd
pounds
of
metallic
revolver
cartridges
while
he
packed
within
his
bosom
a
lighter
though
bulkier
load
consisting
of
white
silk
extra
sandals
a
roll
of
crinkly
writing
paper
and
the
box
with
the
remainder
of
his
gold
coins
over
all
we
drew
our
coats
or
of
rich
stiff
silk
upon
which
the
circled
trefoil
of
the
tokugawa
crest
was
embroidered
on
back
breasts
and
sleeves
these
coats
were
in
turn
covered
with
our
dingy
priest
robes
and
we
were
outwardly
prepared
to
take
the
road
there
remained
our
inward
preparation
we
took
our
biscuits
and
passed
out
the
narrow
entrance
my
first
glance
was
directed
towards
fujiyama
but
the
glorious
peak
was
shrouded
from
view
by
a
bank
of
envious
clouds
yoritomo
turned
at
once
to
a
hollowed
stone
from
which
trickled
a
rill
of
pure
water
we
drank
and
crouched
down
beside
the
spring
to
gnaw
at
our
biscuits
at
first
i
was
too
hungry
to
heed
my
surroundings
yoritomo
however
soon
pointed
southward
through
a
gap
in
the
shrubbery
to
where
some
four
miles
distant
a
hilly
promontory
jutted
out
into
the
bay
is
the
town
of
kanagawa
he
said
i
asked
see
no
smoke
do
you
mean
that
little
gray
blotch
low
down
on
the
edge
of
the
promontory
that
is
only
a
small
fishing
village
lying
among
the
rice
swamps
yokohama
i
believe
is
its
name
kanagawa
lies
about
two
miles
to
the
west
of
it
you
see
no
smoke
because
in
japan
we
use
charcoal
only
kanagawa
is
the
last
station
on
the
tokaido
where
the
stop
over
night
before
marching
into
the
sons
of
the
repose
amidst
the
splendors
of
the
temples
i
bantered
him
he
glanced
about
reverently
at
the
decaying
little
edifice
spirit
of
shinto
is
simplicity
yet
i
wish
i
could
have
entertained
you
with
proper
hospitality
and
that
we
might
enter
yedo
in
the
manner
to
which
we
are
entitled
by
our
i
questioned
we
not
brothers
he
countered
know
the
position
of
my
family
at
home
i
said
it
is
a
far
cry
from
america
to
dai
nippon
i
have
read
what
the
dutch
writers
tell
about
the
hauteur
of
your
nobility
even
as
a
friend
of
a
kinsman
of
your
emperor
will
i
be
received
am
not
the
kinsman
of
the
emperor
he
replied
not
yet

that
your
father

prince
of
owari
and
the
princes
of
kii
and
mito
are
the
heads
of
the
august
three
families
descendent
from
the
three
sons
of
iyeyasu
he
is
the
cousin
of
the
shogun
not
of
the
emperor
one
alone
can
be
called
emperor
of
nippon
that
is
the
dairi
the
mikado
lineal
descendant
of
the
sun
goddess
the
sacred
son
of
heaven
lives
in
awesome
seclusion
at
i
am
aware
that
your
shoguns
whom
the
outer
world
has
known
as
the
temporal
emperors
have
ruled
nippon
with
mailed
fist
since
the
days
of
my
ancestor
the
english
counsellor
of
he
stared
at
me
in
blank
astonishment
english
counsellor
of
iyeyasu
he
your
ancestor
anjin
sama
your
ancestor
adams
the
first
englishman
to
reach
japan
i
answered
you
have
heard
of
was
that
the
english
name
of
anjin
sama
and
he
your
ancestor
you
never
told
me
much
have
you
told
me
of
your
family
tomo
anjin
sama
of
all
the
he
gazed
at
me
with
a
strange
glow
in
his
black
eyes
know
our
belief
worth
that
the
dead
come
back
many
times
and
are
often
born
buddhistic
reincarnation
i
remarked
the
shinto
rebirth
of
the
the
high
ones
he
added
what
of
will
adams
i
demanded
aflame
with
curiosity
know
that
he
married
a
japanese
wife
and
left
children
by
her
have
they
any
living
descendants
he
looked
away
with
an
enigmatic
smile
may
learn
more
of
your
ancestor
brother
after
we
reach
yedo
there
is
an
anjin
street
whose
householders
still
hold
a
yearly
festival
in
his
come
it
is
time
for
us
to
be
as
he
spoke
he
rose
and
started
around
the
corner
of
the
temple
i
followed
him
to
the
corner
and
back
along
the
side
of
the
decaying
building
below
the
ragged
thatch
of
the
eaves
at
the
rear
corner
we
came
to
a
narrow
gap
in
the
shrubbery
looking
down
upon
the
tokaido
yoritomo
suddenly
turned
about
with
his
fingers
to
his
lips
and
drew
me
down
be
praised
he
whispered
did
not
see
us
for
common
to
be
caught
staring
down
upon
a
train
i
peered
forward
and
down
into
the
tokaido
which
ran
past
less
than
a
hundred
yards
below
us
along
the
broad
roadway
was
marching
the
most
curious
and
stately
procession
i
had
ever
seen
it
was
the
retinue
of
a
who
was
going
up
to
yedo
for
the
visit
required
by
law
by
far
the
greater
part
of
the
procession
was
already
strung
out
farther
than
the
eye
could
see
but
half
a
thousand
of
the
rearguard
had
yet
to
pass
used
as
i
was
to
the
sight
of
garments
there
was
much
to
surprise
and
interest
me
in
the
appearance
of
the
retainers
though
as
short
as
our
women
they
were
of
a
more
stalwart
build
than
i
had
expected
and
the
or
men
carried
themselves
with
a
proud
assurance
that
went
far
towards
offsetting
their
lack
of
height
among
the
loose
ranks
of
these
gentlemanly
marched
lesser
retainers
grooms
with
grotesquely
accoutred
and
porters
with
rattan
baskets
and
lacquered
chests
yoritomo
whispered
that
the
palanquin
or
of
the
had
long
since
been
carried
past
by
its
bearers
yet
this
rear
end
of
the
procession
marched
slowly
along
with
a
demeanor
that
could
not
have
been
exceeded
in
solemnity
and
stateliness
had
the
been
present
in
its
midst
the
hush
was
almost
oppressive
no
man
among
them
called
out
or
spoke
or
even
whispered
the
only
sounds
were
the
scuffle
of
sandals
in
the
dusty
road
and
the
muffled
thud
of
horse
hoofs
is
the
crest
i
whispered
staring
at
the
insignia
embroidered
on
the
outer
garments
of
every
retainer
and
marked
on
every
piece
of
baggage
looks
like
a
white
cross
in
a
circled
cross
confirmed
yoritomo
saw
it
in
kagoshima
bay
the
crest
of
my
friend
nariakiri
daimio
of
prince
of
satsuma
i
exclaimed
not
hasten
down
and
join
him
down
and
be
slashed
or
beheaded
by
the
first
we
passed
rejoined
yoritomo
grasping
my
sleeve
as
i
sought
to
spring
up
without
these
tattered
robes
it
would
mean
certain
death
each
is
appointed
a
time
for
passing
along
the
highroad
any
one
who
breaks
in
upon
the
procession
may
expect
to
die
without
benefit
of
he
is
your
friend
and
if
you
are
so
anxious
to
reach
home
by
nightfall
are
no
through
the
rice
swamps
he
replied
must
trail
after
the
move
at
a
pace
will
bring
them
into
shinagawa
the
southern
suburb
of
yedo
about
sunset
in
shinagawa
i
expect
to
find
a
friend
with
whom
we
can
spend
the
night
meantime
we
may
as
well
wait
here
until
the
cortege
has
gone
on
four
or
five
miles
i
will
take
advantage
of
the
opportunity
to
write
a
petition
asking
permission
to
present
a
memorial
to
the
he
crept
back
around
the
corner
of
the
temple
i
stretched
out
in
the
balsamic
shade
of
the
pines
and
watched
the
slow
passing
of
the
procession
when
the
last
strutting
had
marched
on
up
the
road
i
gazed
around
at
the
landscape
across
the
full
width
of
the
bay
the
mountains
on
the
promontory
of
awa
loomed
dimly
through
the
haze
while
the
blue
waters
between
already
stilled
from
their
turmoil
were
dotted
with
the
white
sails
of
junks
and
fishing
smacks
inland
the
golden
sunlight
streamed
down
out
of
the
sapphire
sky
upon
a
scene
no
less
peaceful
and
charming
about
me
and
far
to
the
northward
the
land
lay
in
broad
plain
for
the
most
part
cut
up
into
a
checkerboard
of
rice
fields
here
and
there
rose
knolls
and
hills
some
terraced
to
the
top
for
rice
others
wooded
and
the
most
eminent
crowned
with
temples
that
reminded
me
of
china
in
the
rice
swamps
naked
peasants
in
the
slush
were
transplanting
tufts
of
young
rice
while
about
them
waterfowl
waded
or
paddled
untroubled
by
the
presence
of
man
above
them
soared
numbers
of
eagles
and
hawks
birds
were
to
be
seen
or
heard
on
every
side
but
i
noticed
a
marked
absence
of
animals
from
the
landscape
some
time
after
the
rear
of
the
procession
had
disappeared
up
the
tokaido
yoritomo
came
back
around
the
temple
and
said
that
we
must
start
i
pulled
my
hat
brim
low
over
my
face
and
swung
after
him
down
the
hillside
to
the
smooth
road
for
a
time
we
met
no
other
traveller
the
road
had
been
swept
clear
by
the
procession
but
we
soon
came
to
groups
of
odd
little
shops
and
inns
strung
along
the
roadside
in
almost
continuous
rows
within
the
open
fronts
of
the
shops
tradesmen
knelt
on
matted
platforms
in
the
midst
of
their
cheap
wares
while
from
under
the
shallow
porticos
of
the
inns
quaint
little
maidens
with
powdered
faces
and
narrow
skirts
smiled
at
us
invitingly
and
bowed
until
we
could
see
the
great
bows
at
the
back
of
their
sashes
but
yoritomo
kept
on
up
the
road
at
a
fast
pace
unmoved
by
the
alluring
glances
of
these
charming
little
waitresses
within
the
second
mile
we
began
to
encounter
a
stream
of
travellers
released
from
the
post
town
of
kawasaki
by
the
passage
of
the
train
we
were
the
first
to
come
up
from
the
south
in
the
wake
of
the
but
the
people
we
met
had
no
more
than
a
casual
glance
for
a
pair
of
yamabushi
priests
as
we
swung
along
through
their
midst
i
peeped
out
at
them
between
the
meshes
of
my
loosely
woven
hat
brim
my
first
observations
were
that
they
averaged
far
below
the
height
of
americans
and
that
clothing
was
rather
a
minus
quantity
among
all
but
the
pilgrims
and
the
the
brown
skins
of
peasants
and
fishermen
porters
grooms
and
beggars
were
either
innocent
of
all
covering
except
narrow
loincloths
or
at
most
limited
to
a
of
cotton
a
straw
hat
and
sandals
aside
from
the
aristocratic
swordsmen
these
people
were
the
merriest
i
had
ever
met
when
not
smiling
and
chatting
they
were
laughing
or
singing
among
the
peasants
and
groups
of
pilgrims
were
several
women
the
younger
of
whom
possessed
a
buxom
rural
prettiness
the
married
women
looked
aged
and
withered
and
pleasant
as
were
their
smiles
my
western
eye
was
repulsed
by
their
shaven
brows
and
the
teeth
which
showed
between
their
rouged
lips
at
every
smile
at
kawasaki
we
swung
briskly
down
to
the
bank
of
the
rokugu
river
where
bronzed
ferrymen
stripped
to
loincloths
stood
waiting
for
passengers
in
their
big
punts
a
boat
in
which
the
party
of
a
horseman
had
embarked
was
being
thrust
off
before
yoritomo
could
check
me
i
sprang
forward
to
leap
aboard
in
a
flash
the
drew
his
sword
and
aimed
a
blow
at
me
that
would
have
split
my
head
in
two
had
i
not
dropped
backwards
beyond
reach
furious
at
the
wanton
attempt
to
murder
me
i
sprang
up
and
fumbled
for
a
revolver
as
the
boat
shot
out
from
the
bank
brother
warned
yoritomo
springing
to
catch
my
arm
we
are
only
begging
priests
he
had
the
right
to
resent
our
company
more
he
is
a
one
of
the
if
i
remember
aright
he
is
yuki
a
captain
of
the
palace
tried
to
cut
me
down
in
cold
blood
i
protested
is
a
right
of
all
to
kill
men
and
you
affronted
yuki
by
seeking
to
board
the
same
boat
a
smaller
boat
putting
we
ran
and
leaped
aboard
the
small
boat
as
it
swung
into
the
stream
for
we
had
a
wealthy
old
merchant
dressed
in
plain
cotton
robes
and
the
bearers
of
his
narrow
in
paying
our
ferry
fees
yoritomo
offered
one
of
his
gold
pieces
and
the
owner
being
unable
to
make
full
change
he
gave
him
the
difference
as
a
result
the
polers
bent
to
their
work
with
such
hearty
that
we
reached
the
opposite
bank
a
full
three
lengths
in
advance
of
the
boat
we
sprang
ashore
past
a
bevy
of
little
brown
children
who
were
paddling
stark
naked
in
the
mud
shortly
beyond
we
met
a
pair
of
neatly
dressed
girls
whose
large
mushroom
hats
rested
upon
black
silk
skullcaps
they
smiled
and
greeted
us
in
a
familiar
manner
yoritomo
muttered
a
hasty
response
and
pointed
back
at
the
the
girls
hastened
to
advance
upon
that
gentleman
with
their
battery
of
charming
smiles
and
alluring
glances
in
full
action
i
asked
as
we
swung
on
along
the
tokaido
not
only
begging
nuns
daughters
of
yamabushi
priests
none
would
be
quicker
to
penetrate
our
disguise
replied
yoritomo
and
he
quickened
his
pace
after
a
mile
or
so
we
again
met
a
crowd
of
southbound
travellers
people
caught
at
omuri
by
the
closing
of
the
highroad
we
hastened
on
to
omuri
the
first
post
village
out
of
shinagawa
recently
as
the
procession
had
passed
the
place
was
already
alert
for
business
its
shops
wide
open
and
teahouse
girls
standing
in
the
verandas
we
hastened
on
through
pausing
only
to
buy
some
large
dried
persimmons
that
caught
my
eye
a
mile
behind
the
town
we
came
up
with
the
rear
of
the
satsuma
procession
and
were
compelled
by
prudence
to
slacken
our
pace
to
a
gait
making
the
best
of
the
situation
i
relished
my
persimmons
and
viewed
the
scenery
there
was
much
novelty
and
pleasure
in
the
sight
of
orange
trees
and
bamboos
and
even
an
occasional
banana
and
palm
growing
in
the
same
garden
with
pines
and
other
evergreens
while
the
roofs
of
the
farmhouses
were
oddly
attractive
with
the
beds
of
blue
irises
and
vivid
red
lilies
blooming
on
their
flattened
ridges
above
us
towered
the
giant
cryptomerias
of
the
tokaido
with
their
foliage
while
on
our
right
the
road
skirted
along
near
the
sparkling
blue
waters
of
the
bay
upon
which
sailed
flotillas
of
quaint
fishing
craft
and
junks
that
might
have
served
as
models
for
a
painter
of
the
sixteenth
century
yoritomo
touched
my
arm
and
pointed
to
something
lying
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
road
i
looked
closer
and
saw
that
it
was
the
corpse
of
a
peasant
mangled
by
terrible
sword
cuts
drunken
fool
he
said
unmoved
by
the
horrible
sight
sober
man
would
have
been
found
in
the
road
after
it
had
been
sanded
for
the
passage
of
a
before
i
could
reply
a
little
bell
tinkled
in
the
road
behind
us
and
yoritomo
drew
me
quickly
out
of
the
middle
of
the
thoroughfare
i
glanced
about
and
saw
two
runners
racing
towards
us
at
headlong
speed
one
carried
the
little
bell
i
had
heard
the
other
bore
a
small
bundle
on
a
stick
across
his
shoulder
both
were
stripped
to
their
loincloths
though
at
first
glance
i
thought
that
they
were
clad
in
tights
so
completely
were
they
covered
with
animal
designs
tattooed
in
red
blue
and
white
in
a
moment
the
couriers
had
dashed
past
us
and
were
flying
on
regardless
of
the
stately
cortege
that
barred
the
road
with
the
murdered
peasant
fresh
in
mind
i
looked
to
see
the
satsuma
men
turn
about
with
sword
and
lance
to
avenge
this
outrage
upon
the
dignity
of
their
lord
to
my
vast
astonishment
the
solemn
ranks
split
apart
all
along
the
centre
of
the
road
at
the
first
tinkle
of
the
little
bell
and
the
naked
runners
raced
on
without
a
check
through
the
midst
of
the
procession
of
despatches
for
the
shogun
explained
yoritomo
in
response
to
my
look
of
amazed
inquiry
here
was
food
for
thought
to
last
me
into
shinagawa
slow
as
was
our
pace
nowhere
in
the
world
had
i
witnessed
such
solemn
state
as
was
exhibited
by
this
cortege
a
state
so
exalted
that
men
were
killed
for
venturing
within
of
the
vanguard
yet
at
the
tinkle
of
a
bell
all
had
yielded
the
road
to
a
pair
of
naked
sweaty
unarmed
postmen
what
then
must
be
the
sublimity
of
rank
and
state
arrogated
to
himself
by
the
master
of
this
prince
yet
the
father
of
the
quiet
gentleman
trudging
along
in
the
dust
beside
me
was
the
blood
kinsman
of
that
oriental
lord
of
lords
we
were
close
upon
shinagawa
before
i
realized
that
the
sun
was
far
down
the
western
sky
and
fast
sinking
behind
a
bank
of
black
clouds
as
i
looked
up
my
eye
fell
upon
a
rude
pillory
standing
near
the
roadside
on
ground
raised
above
the
level
of
the
rice
swamp
along
the
top
of
the
rude
structure
sat
five
roundish
objects
sharply
outlined
against
the
sky
looking
closer
i
made
out
ghastly
human
faces
a
crow
flapped
up
from
the
ground
with
a
hoarse
cry
and
began
pecking
at
one
of
the
severed
heads
chapter
viii
the
geisha
day
was
fading
into
twilight
as
we
trailed
after
the
satsuma
men
into
the
heart
of
shinagawa
on
either
side
of
the
tokaido
extended
rows
of
handsome
inns
and
teahouses
set
one
against
the
other
without
a
gap
except
where
divided
by
narrow
cross
streets
the
upper
windows
and
balconies
of
every
building
were
sealed
over
with
opaque
screens
to
prevent
persons
from
looking
down
upon
the
and
his
retinue
and
across
the
entrances
of
the
side
streets
were
stretched
frail
ropes
of
twisted
straw
behind
which
kneeling
crowds
waited
for
the
passage
of
the
last
satsuma
man
the
street
was
guarded
by
wardsmen
or
householders
bearing
iron
staves
with
large
rings
at
the
top
we
shuffled
along
between
these
warders
with
downbent
heads
perilously
close
to
the
rear
of
the
procession
three
or
four
times
the
wardsmen
seemed
inclined
to
halt
us
but
we
passed
by
them
with
outward
indifference
keeping
well
in
advance
of
the
crowds
that
surged
out
behind
us
into
the
tokaido
from
the
unbarred
side
streets
midway
of
the
long
suburb
yoritomo
turned
sharply
into
a
narrow
street
leading
towards
the
bay
i
stooped
under
the
barring
rope
after
him
and
found
myself
in
the
midst
of
a
dense
crowd
of
men
many
of
whom
were
still
kneeling
packed
side
by
side
in
the
jam
were
tradesmen
and
artisans
and
nobles
in
lacquered
palanquins
all
alike
were
provided
with
paper
lanterns
round
square
or
octagonal
in
shape
and
inscribed
with
crest
or
name
in
chinese
ideographs
these
lanterns
and
the
rows
of
similar
ones
hung
along
the
fronts
of
the
houses
were
being
lighted
as
twilight
deepened
into
darkness
suddenly
the
crowd
through
which
we
were
attempting
to
pass
swayed
forward
and
filled
the
air
with
the
clash
of
their
wooden
clogs
on
the
hard
ground
the
rope
had
been
taken
down
and
the
crowd
permitted
to
surge
out
into
the
tokaido
while
we
worked
our
way
in
against
the
outpouring
stream
i
was
pleased
to
see
that
there
were
no
women
in
the
jam
but
on
either
side
of
the
street
screens
exposed
to
view
artistically
decorated
interiors
where
smiling
young
girls
in
gorgeous
dress
knelt
on
the
mats
twanging
odd
music
on
their
or
preening
themselves
before
mirrors
of
polished
bronze
in
other
houses
dainty
waiting
maids
fluttered
about
like
butterflies
serving
the
hungry
guests
the
crowd
in
the
street
was
the
sweetest
one
with
which
i
had
ever
come
in
contact
and
this
was
no
less
true
when
we
elbowed
our
way
through
a
band
of
porters
the
explanation
was
not
far
off
when
with
the
breaking
of
the
jam
we
approached
a
building
through
whose
latticed
front
issued
clouds
of
vapor
and
a
babel
of
chatter
and
laughter
when
opposite
this
house
i
glanced
in
through
the
wide
spaces
of
the
lattice
and
was
startled
to
see
a
large
company
of
nude
men
and
women
splashing
about
together
in
a
great
tank
of
hot
water
it
was
a
public
bath
public
in
all
senses
of
the
term
as
we
passed
by
a
dripping
nymph
stepped
up
from
the
water
within
a
foot
of
the
lattice
and
gazed
idly
out
into
the
street
as
naively
unconscious
in
look
and
manner
and
as
innocent
of
costume
as
eve
before
the
fall
yoritomo
swung
by
unheeding
and
hastened
on
to
the
open
front
of
one
of
the
larger
teahouses
a
moment
later
we
had
entered
a
long
passageway
that
ran
back
through
the
centre
of
the
building
on
one
side
we
looked
in
upon
the
charcoal
ranges
and
sniffed
the
savory
odors
of
the
inn
kitchen
on
the
other
we
viewed
through
screens
the
commoner
of
the
house
at
sight
of
our
tattered
robes
bowing
waitresses
sought
to
usher
us
into
one
of
these
front
apartments
yoritomo
thrust
past
them
and
on
down
the
passage
fifty
paces
or
more
until
we
came
out
into
a
veritable
fairy
garden
strung
with
myriads
of
painted
lanterns
as
we
seated
ourselves
on
a
low
bench
under
a
grape
arbor
the
host
overtook
us
and
bowing
curtly
asked
what
we
desired
kohana
the
free
still
live
here
asked
yoritomo
san
the
artist
patronized
by
princes
still
honors
my
poor
establishment
replied
the
man
would
speak
with
her
said
yoritomo
pushing
back
his
hat
until
his
pale
aristocratic
face
could
be
seen
in
the
soft
lantern
light
the
landlord
who
had
been
about
to
turn
us
off
hesitated
and
answered
in
a
more
respectful
tone
most
famous
dancer
of
yedo
enjoys
the
favor
of
how
then
can
i
bid
her
come
to
attend
those
who
seem
no
more
than
yamabushi
yoritomo
drew
a
sheet
of
paper
from
his
bosom
and
taking
his
brush
pen
from
the
case
at
his
girdle
wrote
a
few
small
ideographs
in
the
classical
chinese
character
swift
as
were
his
strokes
the
first
letter
was
scarcely
drawn
before
the
host
was
kowtowing
forehead
to
earth
he
rose
touched
the
finished
writing
to
his
brow
and
clattered
off
on
his
high
wooden
clogs
across
the
fairyland
of
his
garden
have
declared
yourself
i
exclaimed
him
no
my
manner
of
writing
convinced
him
that
i
am
of
high
rank
but
i
wrote
only
a
quotation
from
one
of
the
ancient
poems
even
if
he
is
learned
enough
to
read
it
this
dancer
then
grasp
your
meaning
is
one
of
the
higher
class
of
called
one
of
the
superior
artists
she
is
of
blood
and
the
old
who
bought
her
in
childhood
and
trained
her
after
the
manner
of
gave
her
the
highest
of
culture
before
i
left
yedo
i
bought
the
freedom
from
service
she
was
then
in
her
eighteenth
bought
her
freedom
i
murmured
who
look
so
coldly
upon
women
could
do
no
more
for
her
and
no
less
we
loved
but
love
can
not
bind
a
true
when
duty
calls
i
vowed
to
give
my
life
to
the
service
of
the
mikado
and
dai
nippon
to
have
lingered
with
her
after
that
would
have
been
i
sat
silent
reflecting
upon
the
strange
customs
of
this
queer
people
and
the
hidden
depths
in
the
nature
of
my
friend
all
my
intimacy
with
him
backed
by
close
study
of
k√§mpfer
and
siebold
had
failed
to
prepare
me
for
the
bizarre
contrasts
and
impressions
of
the
mysterious
land
of
nippon
in
the
garden
about
us
strolled
along
the
walks
on
lacquered
clogs
but
none
disturbed
our
seclusion
in
the
arbor
until
the
landlord
came
shuffling
back
he
kowtowed
before
us
with
loud
insuckings
of
his
breath
i
could
scarcely
hear
his
murmured
words
san
sends
humble
greetings
to
the
honorable
writer
and
entreats
him
and
his
honorable
companion
to
honor
her
lowly
dwelling
with
their
august
need
no
guide
replied
yoritomo
as
the
landlord
rose
to
conduct
us
the
man
again
prostrated
himself
and
held
to
the
obsequious
salute
until
we
had
moved
away
the
moon
gave
no
light
through
the
curtain
of
drifting
cloud
but
as
we
hastened
along
a
winding
path
in
through
the
gay
rows
of
swaying
paper
lanterns
i
made
out
amidst
the
graceful
trees
and
flowering
shrubs
grotesque
bronze
figures
odd
shaped
rocks
and
quaint
stone
lanterns
soon
the
path
led
down
along
the
shore
of
a
tiny
lake
whose
still
surface
glinted
with
the
reflections
of
the
lanterns
we
crossed
over
at
one
corner
on
a
frail
bamboo
bridge
arched
like
a
of
hoop
and
passed
through
a
rockery
to
a
gateless
opening
in
a
hedge
of
bamboos
beside
this
entrance
resplendent
in
a
miniature
of
blue
silk
waited
a
little
maiden
of
twelve
who
having
duly
kowtowed
to
us
tottered
ahead
on
her
high
clogs
to
conduct
us
to
the
house
of
her
mistress
a
few
steps
brought
us
to
a
rambling
bungalow
with
broad
low
eaves
and
verandas
mounting
daintily
before
us
up
the
rough
stone
steps
the
child
knelt
upon
the
polished
planking
of
the
veranda
to
remove
our
sandals
if
she
was
astonished
at
our
mudstained
leggings
she
showed
not
the
slightest
sign
but
bowed
us
into
the
house
with
winsome
smiles
though
all
the
screens
were
open
the
interior
before
us
was
dark
as
midnight
the
little
maiden
reached
down
one
of
the
lanterns
that
hung
from
the
eaves
among
the
tinkling
and
lighted
us
in
across
two
tiny
rooms
to
a
large
apartment
fronting
on
a
miniature
garden
court
all
one
side
of
the
room
was
open
to
the
court
veranda
and
two
of
the
other
walls
were
formed
of
sliding
screens
but
the
far
end
of
the
room
was
closed
with
a
solid
partition
containing
a
shallow
double
alcove
the
little
maid
hastened
to
place
two
soft
leather
cushions
for
us
hesitating
just
perceptibly
over
the
second
until
yoritomo
indicated
that
it
was
to
be
laid
beside
the
first
close
before
the
raised
floor
of
the
larger
recess
having
kowtowed
while
we
reposed
ourselves
on
knees
and
heels
she
pattered
about
the
room
with
a
taper
lighting
the
pith
wicks
of
several
little
saucer
lamps
that
were
set
about
the
room
in
square
paper
frames
i
glanced
around
the
apartment
in
the
increasing
glow
the
soft
thick
mats
all
about
three
by
six
feet
in
size
were
set
in
the
floor
on
a
level
with
the
slotted
of
the
unlike
those
i
had
seen
in
the
front
rooms
of
the
inns
they
were
not
only
immaculately
white
and
clean
but
were
bordered
with
strips
of
silk
the
sliding
screens
of
the
room
were
rimmed
with
gold
leaf
and
painted
with
exquisite
landscapes
in
rich
soft
colors
the
low
ceiling
and
the
recessed
wall
behind
us
were
finished
in
fanciful
cabinetwork
and
the
beautiful
grain
of
the
two
woods
used
was
polished
without
oil
or
varnish
to
a
surface
that
shone
like
satin
the
one
side
of
the
recess
was
an
open
closet
filled
with
shelves
and
drawers
the
other
was
the
sacred
mentioned
by
the
dutch
writers
upon
its
wall
hung
a
blue
silk
banner
painted
with
a
summer
view
of
below
on
the
polished
floor
a
vase
of
plain
earthenware
held
a
single
fragrant
spray
of
cape
jasmine
across
from
the
vase
stood
the
bronze
figure
of
a
playful
kitten
with
paw
outstretched
in
graceful
invitation
before
it
were
placed
a
few
grains
of
boiled
rice
a
tiny
cup
of
amber
liquid
and
a
stick
of
burning
incense
it
was
the
emblem
and
godlet
of
the
a
frolicsome
young
cat
behind
whose
velvet
touch
lurked
cruel
claws
ever
ready
to
mangle
would
the
worshipper
of
this
image
meet
her
former
lover
with
feline
treachery
as
i
asked
myself
the
question
the
room
with
a
ripple
of
gentle
laughter
melodious
as
the
note
of
an
√¶olian
harp
sweeter
than
the
tinkle
of
fairy
bells
i
faced
to
front
and
saw
floating
towards
us
a
vision
as
wondrously
beautiful
as
a
buddhist
angel
against
the
jet
blackness
of
her
high
coiffure
glinted
comb
crests
and
pin
heads
of
amber
and
coral
while
from
slender
throat
to
tiny
feet
she
was
enveloped
in
a
robe
of
scarlet
silk
gorgeously
embroidered
with
flowers
in
gold
thread
and
her
plump
little
hand
fluttered
a
vividly
colored
fan
like
my
the
face
showed
the
type
in
its
oval
contour
small
mouth
and
aristocratic
nose
features
so
markedly
different
from
the
broad
flat
faces
of
the
lower
classes
the
characteristic
lack
of
prominence
of
her
brows
and
the
bridge
of
her
nose
lent
to
the
upper
part
of
her
face
a
mildness
of
expression
well
in
keeping
with
the
inimitable
gracefulness
and
gentleness
of
her
bearing
but
her
rosebud
mouth
and
lustrous
black
eyes
held
all
the
subtle
allurement
of
a
spanish
bound
about
as
she
is
by
narrow
skirts
modesty
compels
the
japanese
woman
to
assume
in
walking
a
short
scuffling
intoed
gait
with
forward
bent
body
and
head
yet
even
to
this
awkward
movement
kohana
san
the
dancer
contrived
to
give
a
semblance
of
grace
as
she
hastened
forward
to
prostrate
herself
at
the
feet
of
my
friend
the
little
maid
was
tripping
from
the
room
the
sank
down
before
us
her
forehead
upon
the
mat
between
her
little
hands
and
her
body
quivering
with
an
excess
of
emotion
which
even
a
lifetime
of
training
could
not
enable
her
to
repress
yoritomo
gazed
down
upon
her
as
serenely
impassive
in
look
as
a
bronze
buddha
yet
beneath
his
placid
tone
even
i
could
detect
the
hidden
note
of
tenderness
we
have
come
to
you
from
a
long
lord
she
murmured
my
lowly
house
first
of
all
she
rose
to
her
knees
and
gazed
into
his
face
with
a
look
of
such
radiant
love
and
devotion
that
i
forgot
on
the
instant
my
suspicion
of
her
loyalty
and
in
the
same
moment
i
forgave
the
thick
powdering
of
rice
flour
upon
her
face
and
the
dark
red
stain
of
thistle
juice
upon
her
lips
and
the
greasy
pomade
with
which
her
hair
was
matted
and
stiffened
for
a
minute
or
more
the
lovers
sat
silent
and
motionless
gazing
into
one
eyes
yoritomo
gravely
smiling
kohana
melting
to
happy
tears
that
was
their
greeting
after
three
years
of
separation
i
whispered
in
english
you
not
see
how
she
has
waited
and
longed
for
you
all
the
time
since
you
left
her
console
her
for
the
past
i
will
go
out
and
leave
not
trouble
he
replied
i
not
told
you
that
we
japanese
do
not
kiss
and
embrace
he
turned
and
spoke
to
the
girl
who
was
glancing
at
me
out
of
the
corners
of
her
long
eyes
with
intense
curiosity
my
brother
is
weary
and
we
have
not
bathed
in
two
lord
no
bath
in
two
days
she
gasped
and
she
clapped
her
hands
sharply
there
sounded
an
answering
and
the
little
serving
maid
appeared
at
the
end
of
the
room
girl
see
that
the
bath
is
as
the
child
trotted
away
yoritomo
peered
out
through
the
open
side
of
the
room
into
the
dim
garden
the
he
ordered
kohana
hastened
across
and
from
either
end
of
the
room
drew
white
paper
screens
out
along
the
slotted
sill
and
until
the
room
was
shut
in
from
the
garden
within
a
minute
she
was
again
kneeling
before
us
yoritomo
smiled
into
her
beaming
face
and
said
will
now
be
honored
by
seeing
the
countenance
of
my
august
brother
he
is
my
friend
and
at
the
word
i
lifted
off
my
hat
and
looked
at
her
smiling
what
she
had
expected
to
see
i
can
not
say
my
oval
face
and
even
my
nose
might
easily
have
passed
for
japanese
and
my
cheeks
were
tanned
almost
to
the
darkness
of
but
the
two
stubble
upon
my
lip
and
chin
was
very
thick
for
the
beard
of
an
oriental
and
my
forehead
much
too
white
while
yet
far
more
my
round
blue
eyes
spoke
of
a
terrifying
world
all
unknown
to
this
gentle
girl
before
my
look
her
eyes
widened
and
purpled
with
terror
she
sank
down
at
my
feet
in
speechless
fear
it
so
kohana
welcomes
my
friend
and
brother
asked
yoritomo
in
quiet
reproach
is
nothing
to
the
girl
straightened
and
gazed
up
at
me
yet
with
a
smile
on
her
trembling
lips
sama
forgive
the
rudeness
of
one
who
is
foolish
and
ignorant
accept
the
humble
greetings
of
your
servant
the
so
fearful
a
beast
or
devil
in
the
eyes
of
kohana

she
still
trembles

the

sun
and
sailed
back

him
from
the

enormous

word

from

had
sailed
for
dai

and
would
force
the
shogunate
to
open
other
ports

are
in
time
brother
all
now
turns
upon
the
wisdom
or
folly
of
the
elder
kohana
rose
to
her
feet
barely
in
time
to
mask
my
face
from
the
gaze
of
the
she
had
returned
to
announce
that
the
bath
was
ready
bid
the
landlord
prepare
his
best
dishes
for
my
guests
then
see
that
no
one
enters
unannounced
said
her
mistress
illustration
she
dropped
her
blue
robe
from
her
graceful
shoulders
the
child
turned
away
in
smiling
obedience
yoritomo
signed
me
to
rise
and
follow
kohana
who
took
up
a
lantern
and
thrust
open
one
of
the
screens
of
the
inner
wall
we
walked
along
a
smooth
planked
passage
twenty
or
thirty
paces
to
a
little
room
with
sloping
slatted
floor
beside
the
door
stood
on
which
hung
thin
towels
of
cotton
print
three
or
four
buckets
of
cold
water
ranged
along
the
wall
and
at
the
lower
end
half
sunk
below
the
level
of
the
floor
was
a
great
tub
or
barrel
from
which
warm
vapors
were
beginning
to
rise
the
hung
her
lantern
to
a
convenient
hook
and
unwrapped
her
long
crepe
or
sash
in
a
moment
she
had
slipped
off
her
robe
and
disclosed
a
still
more
beautiful
under
of
azure
silk
embroidered
with
gold
dragons
loosening
the
inner
she
dropped
her
blue
robe
from
her
graceful
shoulders
and
stood
before
us
as
nude
and
as
unconscious
as
the
nymph
of
the
public
bath
though
i
was
aware
that
she
was
a
member
of
a
profession
that
her
people
class
little
above
the
courtesans
one
look
into
her
earnest
smiling
face
convinced
me
that
her
thoughts
were
innocent
of
all
immodesty
customs
are
not
the
customs
of
the
occident
but
they
are
now
your
customs
woroto
said
yoritomo
and
he
ungirt
his
priest
robe
there
was
no
escape
and
my
hesitancy
was
brief
my
friend
had
submitted
to
many
customs
repugnant
to
him
in
my
country
since
this
was
a
custom
of
his
country
i
could
do
no
less
his
manner
taken
with
the
naive
unconsciousness
of
all
wrong
helped
me
to
realize
that
true
modesty
and
purity
are
of
the
spirit
and
not
of
outward
convention
the
ordeal
was
no
light
one
yet
long
before
the
bath
was
finished
i
had
begun
to
forget
my
embarrassment
in
the
ecstasies
of
wonder
and
delight
over
the
whiteness
of
my
skin
though
distinctly
a
brunette
in
all
else
than
the
color
of
my
eyes
i
seemed
marvellously
fair
to
this
daughter
of
the
orient
whose
own
skin
was
of
the
olive
tint
of
southern
italy
and
spain
with
strict
impartiality
she
aided
our
ablutions
with
the
cold
water
and
then
at
a
sign
from
yoritomo
led
me
first
to
the
tub
it
was
scalding
hot
yet
the
girl
betrayed
surprise
when
i
insisted
upon
the
addition
of
two
cooling
buckets
before
i
would
venture
in
even
with
that
i
was
almost
parboiled
before
kohana
had
finished
shaving
my
friend
and
dressing
his
hair
when
at
last
he
came
to
take
my
place
in
purgatory
the
girl
deftly
set
about
drying
and
shampooing
me
still
exclaiming
upon
the
fairness
of
my
skin
though
it
was
now
far
other
than
having
dried
the
she
proceeded
to
shave
my
face
and
crown
with
her
queer
little
razor
and
to
reknot
my
cue
to
my
vast
relief
she
then
cast
aside
my
yamabushi
robe
and
soiled
leggings
and
left
me
to
dress
myself
in
the
rich
garments
i
had
worn
inside
my
tatters
chapter
ix
greetings
cleansed
and
refreshed
we
returned
to
compose
ourselves
upon
our
mats
in
the
while
kohana
san
once
more
resplendent
in
gala
dress
hastened
out
for
our
dinner
we
were
not
long
kept
waiting
she
returned
with
a
lacquered
tray
or
rather
a
low
table
twelve
or
fourteen
inches
high
this
she
placed
before
me
and
was
out
and
back
again
in
a
few
minutes
with
a
similar
tray
for
yoritomo
each
tray
held
many
little
bowls
of
steaming
hot
food
and
a
pair
of
plain
chopsticks
cut
from
a
single
piece
of
wood
and
not
yet
split
apart
at
the
upper
end
at
first
i
hesitated
to
begin
eating
under
the
eyes
of
this
most
cultured
of
but
my
single
biscuit
and
the
handful
of
persimmons
had
served
only
to
whet
my
appetite
and
the
savory
odors
of
many
of
the
dishes
before
me
were
very
tempting
after
a
thimbleful
of
hot
a
curious
bittersweet
wine
made
of
fermented
rice
we
fell
to
on
the
dinner
which
kohana
served
with
utmost
deftness
and
grace
ever
alert
to
refill
our
porcelain
cups
between
dishes
the
meal
was
odder
than
any
i
had
eaten
even
in
china
soup
omelet
fishballs
and
sponge
cake
soup
boiled
crawfish
salad
and
salted
plums
thin
soup
sweetmeats
pickled

thick
soup
sliced
duck
and
stewed
vegetables
sea
slugs
with
soy
sauce
loquats
stewed
with
sugar
soup
more
soup
and
last
of
all
plain
boiled
rice
without
sugar
which
is
scarce
in
japan
and
without
milk
which
is
unknown
throughout
the
eating
of
this
odd
medley
of
exotic
dishes
kohana
was
either
pattering
out
to
her
kitchen
or
back
with
trays
held
level
with
her
forehead
or
replenishing
our
cups
from
her
heated
flask
of
the
amber
wine
the
time
came
when
we
could
eat
no
more
the
last
dish
was
removed
and
kohana
set
before
us
a
tray
with
smoking
materials
and
an
embossed
brazier
or
in
which
a
few
twigs
of
charcoal
glowed
upon
a
bed
of
ashes
i
had
smoked
too
often
in
japanese
fashion
with
outfit
not
to
know
how
to
roll
a
pellet
of
tobacco
and
fill
the
tiny
silver
bowl
of
the
pipe
now
offered
me
as
we
settled
back
on
our
cushions
and
drew
slowly
at
the
silver
mouthpieces
our
hostess
rose
and
began
to
dance
for
our
entertainment
well
was
she
named
the
best
dancer
in
yedo
unlike
our
western
she
did
not
glide
about
but
stood
in
one
place
seldom
shifting
her
feet
yet
swaying
body
and
arms
and
head
in
movements
of
enravishing
grace
and
beauty
for
one
of
the
dances
she
withdrew
to
reappear
in
a
whose
gorgeously
embroidered
sleeves
fluttering
from
her
extended
arms
suggested
to
me
the
movements
of
a
butterfly
even
before
yoritomo
explained
that
the
performance
was
called
the
butterfly
dance
my
friend
had
however
graver
matters
in
mind
than
amusement
in
consideration
of
my
pleasure
he
had
waited
this
long
now
he
made
a
slight
gesture
and
the
girl
sank
down
flushed
and
smiling
he
spoke
with
austere
abruptness
of
play
when
i
went
upon
my
travels
kohana
said
she
would
be
my
eye
and
ear
in
lord
knows
that
few
things
fail
to
reach
the
ear
of
the
free
dai
nippon
has
been
a
sealed
book
to
me
since
i
sailed
from
kagoshima
in
the
black
ship
with
woroto
she
kowtowed
and
whispered
has
been
no
change
at
he
bowed
low
at
the
veiled
reference
to
the
mysterious
mikado
yedo
he
demanded
again
she
kowtowed
though
not
so
low
highness
minamoto
iyeyoshi
is
still
shogun
iyesada
sama
his
august
son
is
no
stronger
either
in

or

of
the

he
does
not
enjoy
the
favor
of

yoritomo
nodded
slightly
august

dono
enjoys
excellent
health
my
august
elder
brother
mori
she
hesitated
is
not
so
she
said
nothing
as
to
his
mother
and
he
did
not
inquire
but
sat
silent
apparently
meditating
on
her
last
words
i
surmised
that
they
carried
a
meaning
beyond
my
knowledge
of
the
idiom
when
after
a
few
moments
he
lifted
his
lowered
lids
she
went
on
without
prompting
prince
of
kii
is
still
given
over
to
the
pleasures
of
his
women
the
dances
and
the
exploits
of
his
wrestlers
his
august
heir
is
still
a
child
and
kii
dono
has
not
adopted
an
elder
son
to
take
over
the
burden
of
the
child
may
become
a
factor
should
iyesada
sama
depart
this
life
before
his
august
father
said
yoritomo
lord
exclaimed
the
girl
choice
of
the
mito
faction
is
well
known
to
be
set
on
keiki
who
has
been
adopted
by
the
hitotsubashi
family
he
is
the
favorite
of
his
former
prince
of
mito
muttered
yoritomo
his
handsome
face
distorted
with
the
first
look
of
hatred
and
anger
i
had
ever
known
him
to
betray
rekko
lord
of
the
frogs
in
the
well
when
i
left
he
was
still
imprisoned
in
one
of
his
secondary
highness
the
shogun
holds
steadfast
to
the
counsel
of
your
august
father
and
of
ii
keiki
has
won
over
the
council
of
elders
but
the
household
is
with
my
also
is
with
us
he
does
not
forget
that
my
father
brought
about
the
marriage
of
his
adopted
daughter
to
iyesada
said
yoritomo
is
a
traitor
in
camp
my
lord
always
before
this
kii
has
stood
with
owari
against
mito
until
the
saying
has
become
a
proverb
that
no
son
of
mito
can
be
chosen
to
sit
on
the
stool
of
the
shoguns
but
now
kii
swims
in
pleasure
and
owari
stands
alone
against
mito
keiki
aims
high
my
lord
has
read
how
hideyoshi
though
barred
from
the
title
of
shogun
attained
to
the
higher
office
of
would
climb
to
greater
power
on
the
ruins
of
the
shogunate
muttered
yoritomo
shogun
or
kwambaku
replied
the
girl
what
chance
has
he
of
the
first
as
against
my
lord
should
iyesada
sama
go
from
us
and
leave
the
heirship
in
doubt
yoritomo
gravely
shook
his
head
life
is
given
if
i
live
it
will
not
be
to
sit
on
the
seat
of
iyeyasu
my
forefather
our
choice
is
the
child
of
kii
dono
i
have
overcome
passion
the
thought
of
power
does
not
tempt
kohana
prostrated
herself
at
his
feet
with
a
soft
insucking
of
her
breath
lord
has
overcome
all
passion
and
desire
he
has
entered
upon
his
buddhahood
from
it
foolish
girl
he
exclaimed
heart
is
black
with
hatred
of
my
enemies
the
real
enemies
of
dai
nippon
and
i
burn
with
desire
to
win
glory
in
the
service
of
the
sacred
mikado
i
am
far
indeed
from
the
blessed
peace
of
tell
me
has
keiki
made
any
open
move
as
yet
my
lord
she
replied
straightening
and
glancing
apprehensively
about
the
room
yet
but
her
voice
sank
to
a
whisper
plans
are
laid
to
win
the
release
of
his
father
with
the
old
prince
of
mito
free
and
high
in
the
favor
of
iyeyoshi
my
lord
can
easily
foretell
plans
demanded
yoritomo
the
girl
began
to
breathe
quickly
lord
has
heard
how
it
is
said
that
the
princess
azai
holds
the
place
that
should
be
in
the
heart
of
their
august
father
it
is
unbelievable
that
a
parent
should
consider
a
daughter
before
a
son
yet
this
has
come
to
me
in
a
way
that
leaves
no
room
for
doubt
my
lord
would
a
father
turn
his
face
away
from
one
who
had
saved
his
heir
from
the
blades
of
drunken
the
princess
azai
is
more
to
his
highness
than
is
his
thinks
to
win
favor
by
a
trick
after
midday
when
the
princess
is
returning
from
worship
at
zozoji
there
will
be
waiting
blows
will
be
struck
they
will
bear
off
the
of
the
august
lady
keiki
will
rush
to
the
rescue
what
wonder
if
a
fond
father
soon
signs
the
pardon
of
the
parent
after
midday
repeated
yoritomo
in
a
voice
still
and
impassive
as
his
face
he
turned
to
me
will
do
well
to
get
a
full
rest
brother
we
have
work
before
in
the
wind
tomo
i
demanded
in
english
as
kohana
ran
to
draw
out
a
pair
of
silk
quilts
from
a
drawer
in
the
lesser
recess
of
the
be
the
devil
to
pay
answered
my
friend
the
glint
in
his
narrowed
eyes
boding
ill
for
the
he
nodded
towards
kohana
will
tell
you
more
fully
in
the
the
hint
was
sufficient
i
rose
and
followed
the
girl
down
a
short
passage
to
a
small
room
that
was
to
be
my
sleeping
chamber
she
prepared
my
bed
by
spreading
the
two
quilts
on
the
soft
mats
of
the
floor
and
placing
at
the
head
a
little
lacquered
box
rounded
on
the
top
with
a
small
roll
of
soft
paper
this
was
the
pillow
over
all
she
hung
a
large
canopy
of
mosquito
netting
there
remained
only
for
her
to
light
a
tiny
kowtow
and
withdraw
five
minutes
later
i
was
fast
asleep
with
my
jaw
upon
the
paper
pad
of
my
wooden
pillow
how
soon
my
dreams
began
and
how
long
they
continued
i
have
not
the
slightest
idea
but
i
had
a
prolonged
succession
of
the
most
fantastic
visions
imaginable
in
which
elves
and
gnomes
clad
in
outlandish
costume
were
ever
committing
and
unexpected
antics
sometimes
the
performance
was
of
grotesque
horror
as
when
severed
heads
dripping
blood
flew
at
me
with
malignant
ferocity
this
must
have
come
from
a
blending
of
japanese
goblin
tales
with
the
ghastly
spectacle
of
the
outside
shinagawa
after
a
time
i
found
myself
sauntering
through
an
oriental
paradise
in
company
with
a
buddhist
angel
who
bowed
down
and
worshipped
me
as
the
god
of
snow
immediately
i
became
a
snow
image
fast
melting
to
liquid
beneath
the
noontime
sun
i
melted
and
flowed
away
down
through
a
fetid
rice
field
into
the
blue
bay
of
yedo
too
late
i
discovered
that
my
angel
was
none
other
than
the
beautiful
princess
azai
daughter
of
the
shogun
i
was
now
aboard
a
japanese
junk
flying
up
the
bay
to
save
the
princess
from
the
guns
of
the
american
fleet
the
giant
steam
frigates
were
fast
overhauling
my
slow
craft
their
decks
cleared
for
action
and
their
swung
open
tier
above
tier
ready
for
the
bombardment
of
yedo
suddenly
the
junk
struck
upon
a
shoal
over
which
it
was
driven
by
the
billows
only
to
strike
again
and
again
as
the
mast
went
by
the
board
and
the
hull
crunched
to
splinters
under
my
feet
the
stately
flying
the
broad
pennant
of
commodore
perry
swung
around
and
fired
a
thunderous
broadside
into
our
shattered
wreck
with
a
shout
of
terror
i
leaped
up
and
found
myself
reeling
about
a
matted
floor
in
the
dim
light
of
a
tiny
lamp
an
instant
later
the
floor
heaved
and
rocked
under
me
with
a
sickening
motion
that
flung
me
to
my
knees
all
around
i
could
hear
the
creak
and
groan
of
straining
timbers
above
me
my
dizzy
eyes
made
out
a
ceiling
of
and
swaying
walls
whose
gilt
panels
glinted
in
the
faint
light
the
screens
of
the
end
wall
suddenly
brightened
then
shot
open
and
through
the
gap
yoritomo
came
darting
towards
me
lantern
in
hand
he
cried
springing
across
to
extinguish
my
little
which
was
on
the
point
of
jarring
from
its
shelf
the
floor
steadied
with
the
passing
of
the
shock
i
crawled
from
under
the
mosquito
net
and
staggered
to
my
feet
yoritomo
seized
me
by
the
sleeve
and
dragged
me
out
the
way
he
had
come
i
heard
kohana
calling
to
us
to
hasten
we
turned
a
corner
and
saw
her
dart
towards
us
across
a
room
beyond
which
gleamed
a
square
of
early
daylight
again
the
floor
lurched
we
all
three
sprawled
prone
upon
the
mats
while
about
us
the
rafters
and
beams
creaked
louder
than
before
and
the
walls
seemed
toppling
to
crush
us
way
the
shutters
are
open
this
way
my
lord
shrilled
kohana
she
plucked
at
sleeve
and
scrambled
back
tossing
about
in
a
manner
that
would
have
been
irresistibly
comic
but
for
the
terror
of
the
moment
we
followed
as
best
we
could
now
crawling
now
staggering
half
erect
like
drunkards
through
it
all
yoritomo
clung
fast
to
his
lantern
too
dazed
to
extinguish
it
yet
fearfully
conscious
of
the
peril
of
fire
all
around
me
things
were
reeling
i
clutched
at
a
swaying
a
few
feet
short
of
the
gap
in
the
wooden
shutters
that
closed
in
the
outer
side
of
the
veranda
before
i
could
glance
about
a
fearful
shock
flung
me
across
the
veranda
and
out
into
a
bed
of
roses
to
my
sorrow
i
found
that
roses
in
japan
have
thorns
also
i
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
massive
tiled
eaves
seemingly
about
to
pitch
upon
me
i
leaped
out
of
the
roses
clear
across
a
path
and
fetched
up
with
a
skip
and
a
trip
coming
down
squarely
in
a
bed
of
purple
irises
in
perfect
unison
with
my
own
arrival
at
stability
the
earth
spasms
ceased
as
suddenly
as
they
had
begun
from
behind
a
bush
on
my
left
a
voice
murmured
in
quavering
gurgling
delight
lord
you
are
safe
unharmed
answered
yoritomo
and
he
called
in
an
anxious
tone
present
and
accounted
for
i
replied
rising
dizzily
to
face
them
across
the
bush
in
the
red
dawnlight
are
not
hurt
kohana
san
my
lord
she
cried
with
a
soft
chuckle
of
delight
all
it
was
only
a
little
wriggle
of
the
tail
i
inquired
great
fish
upon
whose
back
rests
the
land
of
dai
nippon
explained
yoritomo
with
a
twinkle
in
his
black
eyes
my
lords
will
pardon
the
rudeness
of
their
servant
she
will
go
in
and
prepare
the
morning
bath
for
them
said
kohana
and
before
i
could
protest
against
such
rashness
she
hastened
up
across
the
veranda
into
the
house
i
exclaimed
let
her
go
when
the
house
may
fall
any
moment
it
must
be
shattered
that
little
wriggle
was
a
shock
was
sharper
than
the
usual
weekly
tremor
he
admitted
the
house
is
built
to
withstand
all
but
the
heaviest
quakes
the
massive
roof
takes
up
the
vibration
of
the
shock
which
is
already
broken
at
the
loose
post
following
his
gesture
i
looked
under
the
house
through
the
open
and
saw
that
the
house
posts
rested
each
with
its
hollow
foot
perched
upon
the
round
point
of
a
boulder
he
nodded
reassuringly
and
led
the
way
back
into
the
house
within
i
found
the
mortised
beams
and
panelled
woodwork
unharmed
by
the
earthquake
thanks
to
the
absence
of
plaster
and
standing
furniture
the
only
result
of
the
shocks
had
been
to
fill
the
rooms
with
dust
and
upset
the
vase
with
the
jasmine
spray
in
the
of
the
guest
chamber
yoritomo
smiled
and
pointed
to
the
undisturbed
bronze
kitten
is
hard
to
disconcert
a
or
her
god
kohana
will
soon
have
the
bath
heated
after
that
breakfast
and
a
morning
of
delight
no
other
in
dai
nippon
can
dance
as
dances
i
repeated
the
feigned
attack
of
keiki
upon
the
daughter
of
the
shogun
is
ample
time
and
the
more
we
refresh
ourselves
the
me
more
of
the
plot
is
it
possible
the
government
spies
can
be
deceived
by
such
a
farce
is
never
a
have
heard
me
speak
of
who
because
of
their
own
offences
or
the
death
of
their
have
become
masterless
men
whether
scholars
teachers
or
criminals
all
alike
are
men
for
whose
acts
their
former
lords
can
not
be
held
who
no
longer
owe
loyalty
to
their
lords
i
added
in
law
he
assented
suppose
certain
loyal
retainers
became
at
the
bidding
of
their
master
the
code
says
that
a
man
shall
serve
his
lord
even
to
the
death
what
greater
joy
to
the
mito
men
than
to
give
their
lives
for
the
freeing
of
their
prince
should
hasten
to
warn
the
shogun
i
exclaimed
he
smiled
in
gentle
reproof
of
my
heat
are
guards
at
the
gateways
of
all
bridges
across
the
inner
moat
and
within
are
officials
interested
in
barring
out
the
bearer
of
a
warning
message
remember
keiki
has
won
the
favor
of
midzuano
chief
of
the
council
of

yet
suppose
the
message
should
penetrate
to
the
august
ear
of
iyeyoshi
sama
what
follows
the
princess
does
not
go
to
worship
at
the
temple
of

small
credit
accrues
to
the
would
risk
the
life
of
the
daughter
of
the
princess
to
whom
you
are
betrothed
will
be
no
risk
of
life
for
her
he
replied
the
shock
her
terror
most
delicate
of
our
ladies
are
taught
to
withstand
the
indignity
to
be
suffered
by
a
princess
your
kinsman
i
argued
matters
the
terror
or
the
death
or
even
the
dishonor
of
a
woman
weighed
in
the
balance
against
that
which
i
seek
to
accomplish
no
whatever
the
cost
i
must
win
a
favorable
audience
with
the
shogun
for
the
sake
of
dai
nippon
and
the
sacred
mikado
it
is
a
rare
chance
for
us
woroto
we
will
take
part
in
badger
like
the
fox
snap
the

between
his

punned
he

the

of

the

they

therefore
we
go

chapter
x
the
princess
azai
noon
found
us
ready
for
the
start
our
swords
girt
on
under
the
flowing
priest
robes
and
hats
drawn
low
to
shade
our
faces
upon
our
feet
sandals
were
bound
firmly
over
the
white
silk
foot
mittens
in
keeping
with
our
role
of
monks
of
noble
blood
vowed
to
a
pilgrimage
to

and
just
in
off
the
road
but
the
hilts
of
our
swords
were
within
convenient
reach
inside
the
edge
of
our
robes
and
despite
warning
my
revolvers
were
no
less
ready
i
assured
him
however
that
they
would
not
be
used
unless
the
occasion
justified
when
it
came
to
the
parting
i
looked
to
see
kohana
protest
or
at
least
shed
a
tear
over
this
short
ending
of
her
visit
after
three
weary
years
of
absence
he
had
come
back
to
her
for
a
single
night
and
was
now
going
from
her
again
it
might
be
to
his
death
yet
she
neither
wept
nor
betrayed
any
other
sign
of
grief
smilingly
she
conducted
us
from
her
house
and
down
the
path
to
the
gateway
where
he
signed
her
to
stop
all
goes
well
he
said
will
send
for
you
or
come
again
to
she
kowtowed
with
a
softly
murmured
word
of
parting
kohana
san
i
responded
carries
away
with
him
grateful
thoughts
of
his
kind
and
beautiful
indeed
is
the
condescension
of
the
august
lord
in
deigning
to
overlook
the
conduct
of
one
so
rude
and
ignorant
she
said
yoritomo
was
swinging
away
at
a
rapid
stride
she
rose
quickly
and
held
out
her
hands
clasped
palm
to
palm
her
eyes
gazed
up
into
mine
full
of
timid
appeal
and
her
lips
quivered
with
a
pitiful
smile
sama
is
a
lord
of
the
he
is
powerful
while
he
slept
i
looked
at
the
strange
weapons
he
bears
and
my
lord
told
me
their
use
the
is
a
friend
of
yoritomo
sama
they
kill
him
they
kill
me
i
answered
with
a
swift
movement
she
drew
from
her
sleeve
and
pressed
into
my
hand
a
dirk
whose
richly
ornamented
hilt
and
sheath
told
of
a
precious
blade
within
i
would
have
sought
to
return
the
gift
but
she
sank
down
and
beat
the
ground
at
my
feet
with
her
forehead
i
thrust
the
dirk
in
beside
my
sword
and
turned
away
feeling
that
this
girl
of
a
despised
profession
had
honored
me
with
her
trust
and
gratitude
indeed
i
might
say
she
had
ennobled
me
since
i
had
needed
the
dirk
to
become
a
a
gentleman
with
hat
brim
down
hands
demurely
folded
within
priestly
sleeves
and
body
waddling
from
the
weight
of
cartridges
about
my
waist
i
followed
after
my
friend
across
the
beautiful
little
landscape
garden
of
the
teahouse
there
were
many
guests
strolling
along
the
shaded
walks
or
lunching
in
the
little
kiosks
which
from
the
crest
of
a
terrace
looked
out
over
the
blue
bay
but
unheeded
either
by
guests
or
attendants
we
passed
up
the
garden
and
out
through
a
wicket
gate
in
the
wall
across
from
the
teahouse
as
we
came
into
the
narrow
alley
upon
which
the
gate
opened
yoritomo
warned
me
to
keep
my
hand
on
my
swordhilt
on
either
side
preening
themselves
behind
barred
verandas
i
saw
rows
of
pretty
young
girls
clad
in
gorgeous
robes
we
had
entered
a
street
given
over
to
the
or
courtesans
throughout
the
length
of
the
lane
flushed
with
and
swaggered
aggressively
up
and
down
with
swords
cocked
high
in
their
girdles
twice
we
saw
pairs
of
swashbucklers
draw
upon
each
other
but
hurried
past
while
their
blades
were
yet
clashing
together
in
furious
cut
and
parry
without
looking
back
or
so
much
as
glancing
to
right
or
left
we
swung
ahead
through
the
groups
of
and
drunkards
and
our
steadiness
together
with
the
priest
robes
won
us
safe
passage
to
the
tokaido
along
the
highway
vice
was
for
the
most
part
masked
behind
the
disguise
of
legitimate
teahouse
entertainment
and
the
rakes
and
ruffians
bore
themselves
with
a
less
truculent
manner
among
the
smiling
throngs
of
travellers
and
townfolk
as
we
swung
into
the
busy
thoroughfare
i
caught
my
first
view
of
yedo
a
view
impressive
only
in
the
vastness
of
the
extent
built
in
great
part
on
ground
it
stretched
out
along
the
curve
of
the
shallow
bayhead
and
inland
to
the
northward
in
a
sea
of
gray
unpainted
roofs
partly
relieved
by
an
occasional
temple
or
pagoda
rising
among
groves
of
trees
in
the
midst
of
this
dull
expanse
rose
an
island
of
low
hills
upon
whose
wooded
crests
the
moated
official
quarter
was
built
about
the
of
the
shogun
a
mile
along
the
high
embankment
which
guards
all
the
upper
curve
of
the
bay
brought
us
to
the
black
gate
on
the
boundary
between
shinagawa
and
yedo
a
few
steps
beyond
it
yoritomo
significantly
drew
my
attention
to
a
roofed
covered
in
large
chinese
characters
with
the
ancient
edicts
against
christianity
shortly
after
he
pointed
out
a
temple
in
which
were
the
tombs
of
the
loyal
and
the
lord
for
whose
sake
they
achieved
vengeance
and
martyrdom
somewhat
farther
on
we
left
the
tokaido
and
angled
off
inland
from
the
bay
towards
a
great
park
called
shiba
it
is
formed
of
the
grounds
of
zozoji
and
its
many
subsidiary
temples
tombs
and
monastery
buildings
a
wooden
bridge
carried
us
over
a
canal
or
stream
whose
waters
swarmed
with
the
sampans
of
fishermen
and
roofed
produce
boats
from
up
country
a
little
beyond
this
muddy
stream
we
entered
the
lovely
cool
glades
of
shiba
the
place
was
an
oriental
paradise
of
giant
trees
and
blooming
shrubs
from
which
sounded
the
merry
note
of
twittering
birds
blended
and
dominated
by
the
song
of
the
japanese
nightingale
while
about
the
smaller
of
the
temples
lotus
leaves
and
blooming
irises
rose
above
the
still
waters
of
ponds
stocked
with
tortoises
and
goldfish
yoritomo
gravely
led
the
way
across
this
rear
portion
of
the
sacred
park
along
stately
avenues
of
giant
pines
and
cryptomerias
and
camphor
trees
between
rows
of
stone
lanterns
under
of
wood
and
stone
and
bronze
and
past
grotesque
bronze
images
to
enclosures
where
broad
and
massive
temples
shouldered
up
the
ponderous
weight
of
their
roofs
we
came
out
into
the
main
road
and
turned
along
it
a
short
distance
to
the
entrance
of
zozoji
a
magnificent
gate
guarded
on
either
side
by
hideous
red
and
green
demons
amida
butsu
chanted
my
friend
and
mingling
with
a
crowd
of
worshippers
we
passed
through
the
ancient
gateway
into
the
great
courtyard
about
zozoji
the
temple
stood
at
the
head
of
a
flight
of
red
steps
and
with
its
huge
red
pillars
and
enormous
chinese
roof
of
gray
tiles
was
by
far
the
most
imposing
edifice
i
had
yet
seen
in
japan
a
mighty
sonorous
boom
smote
upon
our
ears
i
looked
to
the
right
and
saw
a
priest
swinging
a
suspended
beam
against
the
rim
of
an
immense
bell
yoritomo
turned
across
to
a
building
on
our
left
and
between
the
thunderous
peals
of
the
great
bell
addressed
a
young
priest
who
was
writing
in
the
veranda
i
could
not
follow
their
low
conversation
but
presently
i
saw
my
friend
hand
the
priest
one
of
his
gold
coins
in
return
for
a
slip
of
paper
after
this
we
joined
another
group
of
worshippers
climbed
the
temple
stairway
and
transferring
our
sandals
to
our
bosoms
glided
in
upon
the
mats
of
the
great
hall
we
stopped
a
little
way
inside
between
the
great
lacquered
and
a
superb
brazier
from
which
was
rising
clouds
of
incense
yoritomo
stared
for
some
moments
into
the
gloom
of
the
vast
interior
shook
his
head
slowly
and
edged
about
to
watch
the
courtyard
and
gate
my
experience
in
china
had
already
acquainted
me
with
the
many
startling
resemblances
between
catholic
christianity
and
buddhism
in
respect
to
priestly
costumes
ceremonial
and
houses
of
worship
yet
i
found
much
to
interest
me
in
the
gorgeous
panelled
ceilings
the
carvings
and
arabesques
and
of
this
grand
temple
at
the
far
end
within
the
railed
space
that
i
might
call
the
chancel
appeared
the
high
altar
crowded
about
with
the
shrines
of
various
images
colossal
candlesticks
and
lotus
blossoms
of
silver
bells
and
drums
for
the
use
of
the
officiating
priests
memorial
tablets
bronze
offerings
and
emblematic
banners
all
about
the
hall
on
the
soft
matting
moved
crowds
of
priests
and
worshippers
tapping
bells
murmuring
prayers
clapping
hands
and
bowing
before
the
many
shrines
a
touch
from
yoritomo
drew
my
gaze
around
i
looked
out
into
the
dazzling
sunlight
of
the
courtyard
and
saw
the
crowds
falling
back
on
either
side
before
a
band
of
in
the
midst
of
the
band
was
a
gilded
beside
which
walked
two
women
comes
follow
whispered
yoritomo
he
led
the
way
up
the
hall
to
the
chancel
and
showed
the
paper
he
had
bought
from
the
young
priest
to
an
old
monk
in
chasuble
and
stole
the
priest
eyed
us
sharply
and
stood
hesitating
until
yoritomo
slipped
a
gold
piece
into
his
itching
palm
at
that
he
led
us
in
behind
the
bronze
screen
or
rail
and
left
us
bowing
in
a
recessed
shrine
before
a
huge
image
of
kwannon
the
goddess
of
mercy
hardly
had
we
gained
this
post
of
vantage
when
the
sudden
hush
throughout
the
temple
told
of
the
entrance
of
the
daughter
though
she
had
come
incognito
a
glance
around
the
corner
of
our
niche
showed
me
the
mass
of
the
worshippers
kneeling
with
forehead
to
floor
through
their
midst
advanced
the
cortege
of
the
princess
led
by
the
venerable
abbot
who
according
to
my
friend
was
a
blood
kinsman
of
the
mysterious
mikado
fearful
of
discovery
yoritomo
drew
me
back
into
the
denser
shadow
of
the
shrine
soon
however
i
heard
the
soft
rustling
of
silk
garments
followed
by
low
murmurs
and
sibilant
insuckings
of
breath
aflame
with
curiosity
i
turned
half
about
and
ventured
to
raise
my
hat
brim
for
a
sidelong
glance
the
lord
abbot
had
passed
on
up
to
the
high
altar
but
the
princess
azai
stood
only
a
few
paces
distant
a
little
in
advance
of
her
kowtowing
women
and
she
was
looking
up
at
the
benevolent
features
of
kwannon
in
the
gloom
above
us
the
outline
of
her
dusky
hair
blurred
into
the
dark
background
but
her
face
as
if
framed
about
with
black
velvet
stood
out
distinct
in
all
the
pure
loveliness
of
an
italian
overlapping
of
rose
and
azure
crepes
draped
her
about
in
graceful
folds
from
the
base
of
her
round
white
throat
to
her
tiny
feet
and
her
hands
were
hidden
in
sleeves
whose
tips
almost
swept
the
floor
beautiful
as
was
her
dress
it
won
from
me
only
a
passing
glance
my
eyes
returned
to
feast
themselves
on
the
innocent
tender
beauty
of
her
face
her
complexion
untouched
by
any
cosmetic
was
of
an
ivory
whiteness
slightly
tinged
on
the
cheeks
with
rose
the
adorably
curved
lips
of
her
little
mouth
were
of
a
clear
coral
red
below
her
delicate
brows
her
black
oval
eyes
gazed
out
between
the
long
lashes
with
the
mildness
of
a
young
and
the
divinely
sweet
artlessness
of
budding
maidenhood
forgetful
of
all
else
in
my
wonder
and
delight
i
thrust
my
hat
brim
higher
and
faced
square
about
a
projecting
corner
of
the
shrine
masked
me
from
the
kneeling
attendants
but
not
from
the
princess
drawn
by
the
intensity
of
my
gaze
she
lowered
her
glance
and
looked
full
into
my
face
on
the
instant
i
knew
from
the
widening
of
her
eyes
and
the
quick
rise
of
her
little
bosom
that
she
had
made
out
my
features
through
the
shadow
of
our
dim
niche
voice
breathed
softly
in
my
ear
not
move
i
waited
breathless
expecting
to
see
the
princess
cry
out
or
sink
down
as
had
kohana
yet
great
as
was
the
awe
and
wonder
in
her
dilated
eyes
she
neither
shrank
away
nor
called
upon
the
guard
to
protect
her
from
the
apparition
such
perfect
control
on
the
part
of
a
girl
so
delicately
nurtured
so
exquisitely
refined
in
look
and
bearing
was
more
than
i
could
withstand
regardless
of
warning
i
raised
my
head
higher
and
sought
to
express
in
a
smile
the
utmost
of
my
admiration
for
her
courage
and
beauty
again
her
bosom
rose
and
fell
to
a
breath
and
her
lustrous
eyes
widened
yet
more
but
the
god
or
devil
whatever
he
might
be
had
been
pleased
to
regard
her
with
a
kindly
look
etiquette
if
not
respect
and
gratitude
called
for
a
polite
response
a
row
of
little
pearls
gleamed
between
her
smiling
red
lips
and
her
lissome
young
body
bent
low
in
gracious
obeisance
illustration
a
row
of
little
pearls
gleamed
between
her
smiling
red
lips
instantly
yoritomo
grasped
my
arm
and
drew
me
around
the
far
corner
of
the
shrine
before
the
princess
had
straightened
from
her
bow
we
were
slipping
out
through
a
narrow
doorway
into
the
broad
veranda
of
the
temple
the
sudden
vanishing
of
the
apparition
must
have
seemed
to
her
clear
confirmation
of
its
godly
or
ghostly
nature
in
the
veranda
i
would
have
stopped
to
whisper
my
blissful
impressions
of
the
beauty
had
not
my
friend
snatched
his
sandals
from
his
bosom
and
imperatively
signed
me
to
strap
on
my
own
the
moment
our
footgear
was
secure
he
hastened
down
around
the
rear
of
the
temple
and
out
through
a
postern
into
a
winding
road
that
led
us
past
the
enclosures
of
two
or
three
mortuary
chapels
had
the
occasion
been
different
i
might
have
pressed
my
friend
to
show
me
these
magnificent
memorial
tombs
and
temples
of
departed
shoguns
as
it
was
he
did
not
pause
until
we
had
passed
down
a
long
row
of
stone
lanterns
and
out
through
one
of
the
beautiful
secondary
gates
of
shiba
at
last
he
stopped
in
a
vacant
space
and
turned
to
reproach
me
with
mild
friendliness
should
not
have
so
risked
discovery
brother
could
i
help
it
i
demanded
is
very
beautiful
tomo
candidly
i
envy
you
your
good
he
gazed
into
my
glowing
face
his
own
quickly
stilling
to
the
placid
buddha
calm
is
an
empty
mask
a
nothingness
he
murmured
love
of
women
the
craving
for
power
the
greed
for
gold
all
alike
are
lures
to
decoy
the
soul
out
of
the
upward
path
to
have
seen
your
future
bride
and
can
speak
of
nirvana
i
exclaimed
is
as
pure
and
beautiful
as
an
angel
yet
i
looked
into
her
luminous
eyes
and
did
not
see
my
saw
soul
you
buddhist
her
spirit
is
as
beautiful
as
her
face
woroto
it
was
your
own
soul
you
saw
shining
in
her
eyes
he
replied
do
you
mean
i
demanded
he
shook
his
head
gently
may
penetrate
the
mysteries
of
the
future
you
may
have
loved
her
in
some
previous
incarnation
as
for
me
i
have
given
my
life
to
the
son
of
heaven
the
holy
chapter
xi
rout
of
the
ronins
for
an
hour
or
more
we
loitered
about
within
view
of
the
great
gate
of
zozoji
waiting
for
the
cortege
of
the
daughter
to
march
out
on
its
return
trip
to
the
citadel
that
the
princess
would
come
back
through
the
main
entrance
was
evident
from
the
fact
that
the
of
her
were
stationed
in
the
road
at
one
side
of
the
grand
carved
portal
yoritomo
stood
beneath
a
camellia
tree
seemingly
lost
in
meditation
but
i
paced
to
and
fro
through
the
passing
crowds
unable
to
restrain
my
impatience
at
last
between
the
meshes
of
my
hat
brim
i
caught
sight
of
the
escort
of
the
princess
issuing
from
the
gateway
in
their
lead
was
the
yuki
who
had
struck
at
me
from
the
ferryboat
at
the
passage
of
the
rokugu
river
the
bearers
of
the
moved
around
and
as
soon
as
the
had
taken
their
seats
the
cortege
formed
in
line
with
one
of
the
before
and
the
other
behind
the
palanquin
of
the
princess
we
drew
back
behind
a
hedge
of
blooming
privet
soon
the
cortege
marched
past
us
at
a
slow
and
stately
pace
though
the
absence
of
standards
indicated
to
the
public
that
the
noble
person
escorted
was
travelling
incognito
and
dispensed
with
the
usual
kneeling
of
the
common
folk
along
the
road
i
examined
with
intense
interest
the
sturdy
bearers
and
the
score
of
proud
or
shogunate
who
made
up
company
these
seemed
to
me
to
be
picked
men
but
they
wore
no
armor
and
carried
no
other
weapons
than
the
customary
sword
and
dirk
though
their
were
neatly
tucked
up
above
the
knees
in
the
tops
of
long
silk
stockings
freeing
their
legs
for
quick
action
their
arms
and
forebodies
were
encumbered
with
the
peculiar
ceremonial
jackets
and
the
long
sleeves
of
their
guard
looks
more
like
dress
parade
than
action
i
commented
are
the
pick
of
the
best
swordsmen
among
the
yet
they
are
all
doomed
men
replied
yoritomo
i
caught
at
my
swordhilt
no
longer
intent
on
the
fringe
of
split
bamboo
which
curtained
the
window
of
the
doomed
and
ourselves
will
have
planned
to
sacrifice
as
few
retainers
as
possible
but
though
they
will
not
be
many
they
will
have
the
advantage
of
armor
our
sole
chance
of
success
lies
in
the
method
of
fence
you
have
taught
me
lunge
for
face
or
neck
waste
no
thrusts
on
can
at
least
hold
them
until
other
rescuers
run
up
i
said
he
shook
his
head
doubtfully
down
the
bay
a
is
coming
there
will
be
few
in
the
streets
and
if
keiki
rushes
up
first
with
his
rescue
party
we
will
be
cut
down
with
the
as
you
say
we
are
playing
against
long
odds
but
the
stake
is
little
hot
soy
will
flavor
the
rice
i
replied
he
shuffled
about
and
we
strolled
out
and
along
the
road
keeping
half
a
hundred
paces
behind
the
rearmost
of
the
strutting
leisurely
as
was
the
advance
of
the
cortege
we
were
soon
clear
of
shiba
and
approaching
a
hill
that
yoritomo
called
the
eminence
was
provided
with
two
means
of
ascent
a
straight
steep
stairway
and
another
one
long
and
winding
the
cortege
passed
by
on
one
side
we
now
descended
into
a
low
and
thickly
populated
quarter
passing
at
every
two
hundred
paces
one
of
the
gloomy
gates
which
divide
off
all
the
streets
of
the
lower
city
into
wards
of
fifty
or
sixty
houses
each
ward
was
given
over
to
a
particular
trade
or
the
sale
of
a
certain
article
as
a
street
of
blacksmiths
squatting
before
their
primitive
forges
a
street
of
toy
merchants
another
of
and
so
forth
shops
and
people
differed
little
from
those
i
had
already
seen
but
for
the
first
time
i
observed
the
lofty
ladder
watch
towers
at
the
top
of
which
hung
firebells
the
urgent
need
of
such
means
of
warning
in
a
city
built
for
the
most
part
of
materials
was
evident
from
a
belt
of
ground
off
to
our
right
in
which
the
only
buildings
unburned
were
a
few
storehouses
my
roving
eye
was
recalled
by
a
word
from
yoritomo
to
be
on
my
guard
kohana
had
conjectured
that
the
attack
would
be
made
near
one
of
the
moats
and
we
were
approaching
a
canal
or
moat
the
outermost
of
the
line
of
fortifications
that
gird
in
the
palace
and
the
or
palaces
of
the
i
loosened
my
swordblade
in
its
scabbard
and
held
my
hand
ready
to
jerk
up
the
skirts
of
my
robes
and
tuck
them
in
the
back
of
my
girdle
the
cortege
moved
slowly
on
down
the
busy
street
and
out
upon
the
old
wooden
bridge
that
arched
across
from
the
grassy
slope
of
the
nearer
bank
to
the
abrupt
stone
wall
which
k√§mpfer
calls
the
outer
castle
we
followed
warily
scanning
the
band
of
that
approached
from
the
far
end
of
the
bridge
and
the
scattered
groups
that
clattered
up
behind
us
through
the
crowds
of
common
people
all
alike
however
showed
the
utmost
deference
in
avoiding
close
contact
with
the
attendants
of
the
princess
and
the
crests
of
their
respective
conspicuous
on
the
backs
breast
and
sleeves
of
their
proved
that
they
were
not
we
plodded
after
the
cortege
across
the
canal
and
through
the
bastioned
gateway
on
the
far
side
out
into
one
of
the
smooth
wide
streets
of
the
official
quarter
here
there
were
no
commoners
to
be
seen
and
the
few
scattered
up
and
down
the
broad
way
were
hastening
to
shelter
before
the
first
gusts
of
the
coming
but
even
the
threatened
downpour
failed
to
hurry
the
out
of
their
stately
strut
seeing
no
sign
of
any
i
relaxed
my
tense
nerves
and
looked
about
at
the
long
walls
of
the
which
lined
each
side
of
the
street
i
knew
that
these
residences
of
the
each
consisted
of
a
mansion
house
surrounded
by
courts
and
gardens
all
set
in
the
defensive
hollow
square
of
the
barracks
what
i
had
failed
to
picture
from
descriptions
was
the
extent
and
odd
appearance
of
these
quarters
one
of
them
stretched
along
the
road
nearly
a
quarter
of
a
mile
its
continuous
roof
of
red
tiles
broken
only
by
a
grand
ornate
gate
midway
of
the
monotonous
fa√ßade
the
mortarless
stone
foundation
walls
of
the
rose
from
deep
curbed
ditches
that
flowed
along
each
side
of
the
street
above
the
high
foundations
the
walls
were
of
black
tiles
with
wide
joints
of
white
plaster
well
up
in
this
checkerboard
surface
rows
of
small
windows
stoutly
barred
against
attack
projected
in
shallow
bays
a
turn
in
the
street
brought
us
in
view
of
the
citadel
just
as
the
came
swirling
upon
us
across
the
head
of
the
street
loomed
up
a
mighty
wall
of
cyclopean
masonry
its
granite
base
deep
beneath
the
placid
waters
of
a
broad
moat
its
crest
crowned
with
trees
and
square
pagoda
guardtowers
our
street
rose
to
meet
the
causeway
that
ran
along
the
moat
bank
and
curved
in
to
cross
a
wooden
bridge
at
the
far
side
a
huge
bastioned
gateway
led
up
into
the
higher
ground
of
the
citadel
beyond
the
trees
and
pagodas
that
fringed
the
top
of
the
titanic
wall
i
saw
outlined
against
the
blackening
sky
the
lofty
white
peak
of
the
of
tower
in
the
o
shira
or
innermost
castle
then
the
full
force
of
the
storm
struck
us
and
wrapped
us
about
in
blinding
swirling
torrents
of
rain
yoritomo
pressed
up
close
to
me
and
bent
over
to
make
himself
heard
above
the
howls
of
the
wind
and
the
drumming
splatter
of
the
deluge
ready
he
warned
this
street
that
runs
in
on
the
left
where
the
vanguard
is
passing
there
is
one
just
beyond
on
the
right
at
the
moat
gate
is
stationed
a
powerful
guard
if
the
fail
to
attack
here
i
cried
grasping
at
my
swordhilt
out
of
the
narrow
street
on
the
left
were
streaming
a
number
of
cloaked
figures
silent
and
downbent
as
though
intent
only
upon
making
their
way
through
the
storm
as
they
filed
out
into
the
broad
roadway
alongside
the
of
the
princess
a
gust
of
wind
tore
open
the
cloak
of
one
in
the
rear
and
exposed
to
our
gaze
the
bright
links
of
chain
armor
within
hissed
yoritomo
make
i
let
go
my
sword
and
hastened
to
follow
his
example
by
tucking
my
robe
skirts
in
the
back
of
my
girdle
and
tying
up
my
long
sleeves
in
the
midst
i
saw
one
of
the
turn
upon
the
nearest
with
a
repellent
gesture
instantly
the
assassin
drew
his
sword
and
struck
a
fearful
blow
the
head
of
the
luckless
leaped
from
his
shoulders
and
fell
after
the
corpse
into
the
mud
and
water
at
the
treacherous
blow
all
the
who
had
seen
it
yelled
with
fury
and
amazement
and
flashed
out
their
swords
to
strike
down
the
murderer
but
their
blades
clashed
without
effect
upon
his
hidden
helmet
and
armor
and
in
an
instant
the
other
were
beside
their
chief
slashing
back
at
the
armorless
half
a
dozen
guardsmen
fell
beneath
the
blades
slain
outright
or
hideously
maimed
all
in
the
brief
moment
before
those
in
the
van
of
the
cortege
could
turn
about
and
rush
to
their
aid
i
found
myself
with
drawn
sword
struggling
frantically
to
free
myself
from
the
grip
of
my
friend
though
i
was
the
stronger
he
held
me
fast
by
some
subtle
trick
of
art
that
without
injuring
rendered
me
as
helpless
as
a
child
yet
he
muttered
yet
brother
unable
to
free
myself
i
was
forced
to
stand
and
glare
impotently
through
the
whirling
rain
at
the
terrible
massacre
at
the
beginning
of
the
fight
the
had
numbered
a
fourth
more
than
the
assailants
now
they
were
already
less
than
equal
in
number
with
merciless
swiftness
the
struck
out
in
terrific
blows
that
split
heads
to
the
chin
and
hewed
off
arms
and
legs
and
ripped
open
bodies
with
hideous
slashes
vainly
the
brave
parried
and
slashed
back
at
their
foes
with
strokes
no
less
powerful
and
often
more
skilful
for
the
most
part
their
blows
served
only
to
slice
the
false
covering
from
the
helmets
of
the
or
nick
the
steel
and
brass
under
the
masking
cloaks
but
every
stroke
of
the
blades
that
reached
its
mark
meant
a
ghastly
wound
yet
the
were
not
the
only
ones
that
fell
in
the
bloody
shambles
twice
i
saw
go
down
under
blows
that
split
clean
through
their
steel
helmets
others
were
bitten
deep
by
blades
that
slashed
through
the
firmest
chain
mail
while
more
lost
a
foot
or
a
hand
from
the
lightning
strokes
of
the
swordsmen
but
gloriously
as
the
fought
the
were
no
less
brave
and
little
less
skilful
and
the
armor
gave
them
an
advantage
impossible
to
overcome
never
had
i
dreamt
of
such
terrific
fighting
in
as
many
seconds
a
dozen
of
the
guard
were
lying
mutilated
under
the
sandals
of
the
every
near
the
of
the
princess
and
all
but
three
or
four
of
those
in
the
rear
were
slain
one
of
the
bearers
of
the
rearmost
caught
up
a
sword
and
struck
out
manfully
back
flashed
a
blow
that
split
him
to
the
middle
his
who
so
far
had
stood
as
though
paralyzed
by
fright
fled
past
us
shrieking
but
not
one
of
the
proud
sought
to
escape
shouting
fierce
imprecations
the
last
of
the
rearguard
parried
and
struck
each
as
long
as
he
could
stand
without
giving
back
an
inch
before
the
merciless
attack
of
their
murderers
the
six
members
of
the
vanguard
still
left
burst
through
the
ring
of
that
was
closing
about
them
and
fought
their
way
back
towards
the
of
the
princess
whose
bearers
were
being
forced
by
threatening
blades
to
swing
about
to
the
narrow
side
street
shouted
yoritomo
as
the
again
closed
around
the
vanguard
he
freed
me
and
leaped
away
up
the
street
flourishing
his
sword
and
yelling
i
rushed
after
him
with
the
sight
of
the
fighting
and
slaughter
and
utterly
lost
to
all
sense
of
danger
in
my
fury
at
the
ferocious
treachery
of
the
assassins
i
roared
in
english
you
devils
for
answer
the
head
of
the
last
came
rolling
towards
us
along
the
wet
pavement
close
after
it
a
pair
of
sprang
to
meet
and
slash
down
the
audacious
priests
out
lunged
sword
and
the
foremost
murderer
fell
headlong
stabbed
through
the
throat
the
second
slashed
at
my
head
but
the
stroke
glanced
harmlessly
down
my
parrying
blade
and
before
the
fellow
could
recover
guard
i
drove
my
point
into
one
of
his
glaring
eyes
as
my
man
fell
across
three
others
came
running
at
us
with
the
ferocity
of
tigers
we
sprang
to
meet
them
one
fortunately
was
slightly
outdistanced
by
his
fellows
the
swords
of
the
two
leaders
clashed
against
ours
in
fierce
eager
strokes
a
blow
barely
warded
struck
off
my
hat
and
exposed
fully
to
the
gaze
of
my
opponent
my
distended
blue
eyes
a
look
of
horror
flashed
across
his
vengeful
face
doubtless
he
thought
me
a
demon
for
the
barest
fraction
of
a
second
he
faltered
it
was
enough
for
me
before
his
gaping
mouth
could
snap
shut
he
fell
to
my
lunge
i
wheeled
to
meet
the
third
man
who
as
yoritomo
parried
with
the
second
for
an
opening
had
sprung
around
for
a
treacherous
side
slash
my
outstretched
blade
met
but
failed
to
check
entirely
the
blow
which
fell
across
the
back
of
right
shoulder
meeting
my
gaze
the
ronin
faltered
as
had
his
mate
and
the
result
was
as
fatal
to
him
how
seriously
yoritomo
had
been
wounded
i
could
not
tell
i
doubt
if
he
was
aware
he
had
been
struck
his
lunge
followed
after
mine
flash
upon
flash
we
darted
forward
leaving
five
of
the
murderous
band
already
accounted
for
four
more
were
intent
upon
driving
the
bearers
of
on
across
into
the
side
street
all
the
others
were
crowding
around
the
few
survivors
of
the
vanguard
in
furious
attack
only
supreme
masters
of
japanese
swordcraft
could
have
so
long
withstood
the
tremendous
blows
of
the
assassins
throughout
this
atrocious
massacre
to
fling
ourselves
into
the
midst
of
the
deadly
struggle
was
sheer
madness
but
it
was
a
glorious
madness
having
a
start
of
my
friend
i
dashed
ahead
past
the
rearmost
from
which
the
younger
was
frantically
struggling
to
free
herself
the
of
the
princess
had
been
swung
about
and
its
reluctant
bearers
were
being
forced
into
a
trot
by
prodding
dirks
shouting
a
command
for
the
bearers
to
halt
i
ran
upon
the
at
the
rear
who
were
directly
before
me
until
this
moment
they
had
been
too
intent
upon
driving
the
bearers
to
perceive
us
the
sight
of
their
fallen
comrades
and
the
possibility
of
a
check
in
their
plans
seemed
to
madden
them
they
rushed
to
meet
me
with
a
silent
rage
that
flamed
into
wildest
fury
at
sight
of
my
eyes
kill
kill
they
yelled
and
their
strokes
flashed
out
at
me
so
swift
and
strong
that
i
was
beaten
back
a
full
two
yards
and
saved
myself
from
the
whistling
blades
only
by
the
nimblest
of
footwork
and
parrying
in
a
moment
though
none
too
soon
yoritomo
sprang
to
my
side
and
crippled
one
of
the
grinning
fiends
with
a
leg
cut
this
man
must
have
been
the
leader
of
the
band
for
as
he
and
his
mate
fell
to
our
thrusts
the
pair
at
the
head
of
the
checked
their
charge
upon
us
and
shouted
loudly
to
their
fellows
only
three
of
the
now
stood
in
the
merciless
circle
of
swords
and
but
one
of
their
assailants
had
fallen
at
the
cry
for
help
the
greater
number
of
the
wheeled
about
and
charged
upon
us
with
the
rain
splashing
upon
their
downbent
helmet
brims
gasped
yoritomo
bending
over
to
lean
upon
his
sword
arm
weakens
shoot
already
my
right
hand
was
thrusting
into
my
bosom
as
i
drew
out
one
of
the
revolvers
and
cocked
it
i
stepped
forward
and
to
the
left
that
i
might
have
the
between
me
and
the
charging
at
the
same
moment
the
young
woman
from
the
rear
darted
between
the
bearers
and
stood
up
across
from
me
facing
the
with
upraised
dirk
she
could
not
have
hoped
to
stop
the
ruffians
for
an
instant
but
she
thought
they
meant
to
injure
her
mistress
and
so
was
offering
her
own
bosom
first
to
the
murderous
blades
the
sight
of
such
absolute
courage
and
devotion
steadied
my
twitching
hand
i
raised
my
revolver
and
fired
as
rapidly
as
i
could
work
hammer
and
trigger
the
were
too
close
for
me
to
miss
even
through
the
swirl
of
wind
and
rain
i
risked
no
glancing
of
balls
from
mailed
breasts
but
aimed
at
the
devilish
faces
below
their
broad
helmet
brims
to
shoot
wide
of
such
large
marks
within
a
distance
of
ten
paces
and
less
would
have
been
difficult
and
a
man
shot
from
the
front
anywhere
between
mouth
and
brows
never
requires
a
second
ball
down
went
the
foremost
sprawling
backwards
in
the
flooded
roadway
one
at
every
shot
to
these
medi√¶val
warriors
acquainted
only
with
antique
matchlocks
and
tower
muskets
the
mysterious
appearance
and
rapid
fire
of
my
revolver
must
have
been
even
more
appalling
than
the
death
of
their
leaders
before
i
could
snatch
out
my
second
pistol
every
man
of
them
still
on
his
feet
fled
towards
the
narrow
cross
street
shrieking
that
i
was
the
of
demons
to
aid
their
flight
i
sent
after
them
a
leaden
message
that
glanced
from
the
helmet
of
the
rearmost
man
yet
sent
him
staggering
for
a
dozen
yards
chapter
xii
escort
to
the
princess
a
gust
whirled
the
smoke
of
the
shot
into
my
face
as
i
paused
with
pistol
waiting
for
the
puff
to
sweep
aside
i
heard
the
lady
calling
cheerfully
to
her
mistress
princess
august
lady
fear
nothing
the
have
fled
i
gazed
about
at
the
on
the
far
side
the
brave
girl
was
kneeling
in
her
drenched
silks
intent
upon
reassuring
the
occupant
of
the
palanquin
with
word
and
smile
but
the
princess
had
turned
to
the
window
on
my
side
and
heedless
of
the
rain
was
peering
out
at
me
through
the
parted
bamboo
curtain
with
even
more
awe
and
wonder
in
her
dusky
eyes
than
when
she
saw
me
in
the
temple
my
features
flushed
and
distorted
as
they
were
from
the
rage
of
battle
and
bloodshed
and
fully
exposed
to
view
by
the
loss
of
my
hat
must
have
appeared
to
her
both
and
terrifying
yet
she
was
aware
that
i
had
helped
to
save
her
from
the
the
girl
was
exclaiming
the
fact
through
the
other
window
i
bent
toward
her
with
a
reassuring
smile
but
before
i
could
speak
yoritomo
shouted
to
the
bearers
men
to
the
palace
the
girl
sprang
up
as
the
willing
bearers
swung
around
over
the
bodies
of
the
dead
and
wounded
the
two
who
alone
had
lived
to
witness
the
flight
of
the
came
staggering
to
meet
the
litter
the
blood
of
their
many
wounds
dripping
with
the
rain
from
their
tattered
coats
one
of
them
i
recognized
as
yuki
the
captain
past
the
wounded
men
darted
the
aged
woman
of
the
foremost
whose
bearers
had
fled
at
the
beginning
of
the
attack
and
who
had
only
just
contrived
to
squeeze
from
her
narrow
box
i
drew
a
deep
breath
and
stared
around
at
the
bloody
scene
through
the
lessening
rain
in
sudden
bewilderment
to
have
witnessed
the
butchery
of
all
those
brave
to
have
had
so
large
a
part
in
the
defeat
and
rout
of
their
murderers
to
have
met
again
the
soft
gaze
of
the
daughter
all
within
little
more
than
two
minutes
small
wonder
i
stood
dazed
it
was
my
first
fight
the
first
time
i
had
ever
met
and
struck
down
men
in
mortal
combat
one
of
the
wounded
had
dragged
himself
a
little
aside
and
crouched
on
knees
and
heels
was
bending
forward
with
the
point
of
his
dirk
at
his
bared
left
loin
i
caught
at
arm
to
point
out
the
man
but
before
he
could
turn
to
look
the
had
stabbed
himself
and
was
drawing
the
blade
across
his
middle
with
a
horrible
deliberateness
after
the
cross
stroke
there
followed
an
upward
cut
the
suicide
swayed
forward
in
silent
agony
yet
still
had
strength
and
resolution
to
draw
out
the
blade
and
plunge
it
through
his
neck
murmured
yoritomo
in
a
tone
of
deepest
respect
has
saved
his
family
from
disgrace
and
punishment
see
there
are
two
others
who
would
do
the
one
had
been
enough
for
me
i
turned
shuddering
to
pick
my
way
over
the
bodies
of
the
dead
in
the
wake
of
the
slowly
advancing
the
was
blowing
away
as
swiftly
as
it
had
dashed
upon
us
with
the
passing
of
the
last
shower
a
burst
of
golden
light
from
the
low
western
sun
flooded
over
the
roof
of
the
on
our
left
at
the
same
moment
i
heard
the
sound
of
rushing
feet
as
i
flung
up
my
downbent
head
the
glittered
on
the
wet
silks
and
bared
steel
of
a
band
of
that
came
charging
out
of
the
street
on
the
right
cried
yoritomo
and
clapping
his
hat
upon
my
head
he
darted
forward
to
thrust
a
roll
of
writing
through
the
window
of
the
into
the
lap
of
the
princess
with
my
second
revolver
held
loose
under
the
edge
of
my
robe
i
sprang
after
him
to
the
side
of
the
as
the
mito
men
swarmed
out
and
closed
about
the
crippled
cortege
the
first
glance
had
shown
them
the
failure
of
their
diabolical
plot
utterly
disconcerted
and
bewildered
by
the
defeat
of
the
they
ran
about
like
wolves
that
have
overshot
the
trail
of
their
quarry
the
two
wounded
sought
to
wave
them
aside
but
so
many
blocked
the
way
that
our
party
was
forced
to
halt
the
thought
flashed
upon
me
that
they
might
butcher
every
one
of
us
except
the
princess
and
then
claim
all
the
credit
of
the
rescue
this
i
am
certain
would
have
been
the
course
of
action
of
the
more
among
them
had
not
the
older
men
bethought
themselves
that
they
could
not
silence
the
daughter
to
accomplish
the
object
of
their
plot
they
must
bring
her
safe
to
her
father
in
the
midst
of
their
flurry
and
confusion
a
came
swaying
around
the
corner
of
the
side
street
at
a
most
unlordly
speed
before
it
the
excited
parted
their
ranks
and
the
bearers
trotted
across
as
if
to
range
alongside
the
of
the
princess
yoritomo
sprang
before
them
with
barring
sword
he
commanded
the
bearers
halted
at
the
word
but
the
burst
into
angry
yells
and
turned
to
rush
upon
the
audacious
priest
who
had
dared
to
oppose
the
advance
of
their
lord
a
glance
around
in
search
for
some
way
of
escape
showed
me
the
windows
of
the
jammed
with
the
heads
of
women
and
the
main
street
full
of
running
and
my
pistol
shots
had
been
heard
above
the
uproar
of
the
squall
regardless
of
the
swiftly
gathering
crowd
men
pressed
upon
yoritomo
with
upraised
swords
i
drew
my
revolver
and
stepped
forward
beside
him
certain
that
the
end
had
come
i
could
not
hope
to
overawe
so
large
a
band
with
a
few
shots
without
doubt
we
would
have
been
overwhelmed
and
cut
down
within
the
next
had
not
their
master
called
upon
our
menacing
opponents
to
fall
back
the
bearers
of
the
black
set
down
their
burden
and
the
nearest
sprang
to
remove
the
top
the
aristocrat
who
arose
from
the
depths
of
the
palanquin
was
younger
and
even
handsomer
than
yoritomo
but
his
eyes
between
their
excessively
narrow
lids
had
a
shiftiness
that
reminded
me
of
the
treacherous
malays
yoritomo
bowed
low
to
him
in
mock
politeness
thousand
years
to
the
heir
of
hitotsubashi
he
said
keiki
sama
come
sooner
he
might
have
aided
the
progress
of
the
daughter
instead
of
blocking
the
passage
of
the
august
that
false
priest
commanded
keiki
stung
beyond
but
before
the
eager
could
spring
in
upon
him
yoritomo
flung
the
priest
robe
from
his
shoulders
and
exposed
to
view
the
tokugawa
crests
upon
his
silk
angry
as
were
the
mito
men
they
stopped
short
at
that
insignia
of
the
ruling
family
again
yoritomo
bowed
to
keiki
and
spoke
with
biting
sarcasm
son
of
owari
dono
greets
the
son
of
mito
dono
it
may
be
possible
that
keiki
sama
is
disappointed
at
having
arrived
too
late
to
share
in
the
slaying
of
certain
wounds
have
been
received
by
those
who
defended
the
august
lady
but
if
the
heir
of
hitotsubashi
will
condescend
to
soil
his
honorable
feet
proposal
is
made
that
he
exhibit
his
skill
as
a
for
a
moment
i
feared
that
the
fiery
young
lord
would
snap
at
the
ironical
challenge
he
flushed
a
dusky
red
beneath
his
olive
skin
and
glared
at
my
friend
with
a
malignancy
that
caused
me
to
raise
and
aim
my
revolver
with
an
instinctive
movement
such
as
might
have
followed
the
sudden
uprearing
of
a
venomous
snake
had
keiki
so
much
as
signed
to
his
retainers
he
himself
would
have
been
the
first
to
die
but
a
counsellor
was
murmuring
quick
words
into
the
ear
of
his
master
features
relaxed
to
the
blank
inscrutable
calmness
of
heir
of
hitotsubashi
does
not
pollute
himself
by
crossing
swords
with
common
street
brawlers
he
answered
yoritomo
smiled
suavely
sama
need
not
fear
to
pollute
his
sword
such
of
the
brawlers
as
have
not
fled
are
all
slain
fortunate
is
the
who
dies
beneath
sword
or
finds
opportunity
to
commit
the
stern
torturers
rack
the
limbs
of
criminals
until
they
confess
all
the
foul
plans
of
themselves
and
their
unable
to
face
my
challenging
glance
keiki
turned
to
the
wounded
captain
of
guard
he
called
on
again
my
cortege
is
at
the
service
of
the
daughter
to
escort
her
safe
to
the
inner
the
younger
lady
who
had
knelt
beside
the
of
the
princess
whispered
across
to
the
older
lady
she
in
turn
bowed
and
whispered
to
yuki
though
tottering
from
his
wounds
the
captain
straightened
and
replied
to
keiki
in
a
tone
of
haughty
command
aside
with
your
men
lord
the
daughter
of
the
tycoon
is
satisfied
with
the
escort
of
the
two
champions
who
destroyed
the
evil
at
this
the
newly
arrived
came
shouldering
their
way
in
among
the
mito
men
with
scant
ceremony
and
keiki
hastened
to
give
the
signal
for
his
retainers
to
fall
back
again
the
bearers
of
the
princess
started
forward
with
the
two
wounded
in
the
lead
each
supported
between
a
pair
of
his
the
others
stationed
themselves
behind
to
act
as
rearguard
yoritomo
sheathed
his
sword
and
placed
himself
before
the
old
lady
on
the
right
side
of
the
following
his
example
i
thrust
my
sword
and
revolver
inside
my
robe
and
stationed
myself
on
the
left
of
the
in
front
of
the
girl
as
we
advanced
through
the
crowd
of
curious
onlookers
i
glanced
about
at
the
baffled
mito
men
who
were
attempting
to
the
of
their
lord
by
forming
about
his
in
the
usual
stately
cortege
chancing
to
catch
the
eager
gaze
of
the
girl
i
smiled
and
nodded
encouraged
by
my
condescension
to
venture
a
like
breach
of
etiquette
she
bowed
low
and
murmured
with
a
soft
laugh
lord
pardon
the
rudeness
of
setsu
setsu
san
is
free
to
speak
i
said
thousand
years
of
happy
life
to
my
lord
she
murmured
pardon
the
inexcusable
rudeness
but
the
awesome
face
of
my
lord
has
been
seen
by
august
eyes
should
report
be
made
that
my
lord
is
to
be
numbered
among
the
or
is
he
a
of
the
come
to
aid
dai
nippon
with
sword
and
counsel
i
answered
she
bowed
low
with
a
gentle
insucking
of
breath
and
fell
silent
but
as
i
sauntered
along
beside
the
slowly
moving
i
caught
glimpses
of
a
pair
of
soft
black
eyes
peering
at
me
through
the
fringe
of
the
window
curtain
there
could
be
no
doubt
that
the
daughter
was
studying
such
of
my
face
as
showed
below
the
hat
brim
the
thought
that
she
might
be
seeking
to
accustom
herself
to
the
eyes
of
the
set
me
aglow
with
blissful
anticipations
but
my
amorous
fancies
quickly
gave
place
to
hot
shame
at
the
remembrance
that
the
gentle
little
princess
was
the
betrothed
of
my
friend
our
slow
advance
at
last
brought
us
up
on
the
causeway
across
the
moat
from
the
cyclopean
wall
and
gate
the
passage
had
been
made
through
the
midst
of
a
multitude
drawn
in
rapidly
increasing
numbers
by
wild
rumors
of
the
fight
the
causeway
swarmed
with
hundreds
of
who
stared
at
yoritomo
and
myself
in
respectful
silence
a
company
of
the
in
charge
of
the
great
gate
had
advanced
across
the
bridge
to
meet
the
princess
near
the
foot
of
the
bridge
yoritomo
signed
me
to
stop
we
stepped
back
while
the
and
those
who
followed
it
passed
on
between
a
venerable
wearing
the
circled
cross
of
satsuma
saluted
yoritomo
and
pointed
westward
to
the
gate
of
one
of
the
nearer
sends
greeting
to
yoritomo
sama
the
heroic
son
of
owari
dono
and
to
his
heroic
companion
he
said
they
honor
the
house
of
shimadzu
by
entering
and
refreshing
themselves
our
greetings
and
thanks
to
the
daimio
of
satsuma
replied
yoritomo
hope
soon
to
visit
shimadzu
sama
but
now
we
have
come
from
a
long
journey
and
must
hasten
to
salute
my
son
of
owari
dono
is
wounded
suggested
the
wound
received
in
a
good
cause
bears
no
sting
replied
my
friend
with
a
confucian
sententiousness
that
drew
an
appreciative
murmur
from
the
crowd
he
waved
aside
the
old
with
a
courteous
gesture
and
crossed
to
me
brother
we
must
be
on
our
way
the
sun
is
low
and
we
have
no
the
again
hastened
around
before
him
and
bent
low
that
yoritomo
sama
might
be
unable
to
linger
for
a
call
my
lord
took
the
liberty
to
send
for
the
conveyance
of
the
son
of
owari
dono
and
his
gracious
offer
of
shimadzu
the
daimio
of
satsuma
is
accepted
with
grateful
thanks
responded
yoritomo
at
a
sign
from
the
two
were
borne
forward
through
the
crowd
and
their
doors
opened
for
us
to
enter
calling
to
mind
instructions
i
slipped
off
my
sandals
and
squeezed
into
one
of
the
narrow
boxes
once
inside
i
crouched
down
on
knees
and
heels
in
quite
the
correct
manner
though
i
caught
a
murmur
of
politely
smothered
surprise
at
my
failure
to
remove
my
hat
a
later
our
palanquins
were
swinging
westward
along
the
walled
edge
of
the
moat
an
escort
of
satsuma
in
van
and
rear
and
the
old
leader
in
attendance
beside
chapter
xiii
the
prince
of
owari
our
trip
through
the
quarter
must
have
covered
two
miles
and
more
though
closely
cramped
in
my
elegant
box
i
managed
by
stooping
over
to
peer
out
through
the
bamboo
fringe
of
the
windows
for
some
time
we
had
on
our
left
the
walls
of
large
and
on
our
right
the
beautiful
with
the
lofty
rampart
of
the
citadel
across
the
sun
sank
beneath
the
horizon
as
we
turned
westward
down
a
wide
thoroughfare
presently
we
turned
again
and
passed
zigzag
from
one
street
to
another
between
silent
the
buildings
were
lighted
only
by
quaint
street
lanterns
hung
beside
their
heavy
gateways
and
by
the
dim
glow
of
candles
through
the
white
paper
screens
of
the
windows
the
few
people
passing
along
these
aristocratic
streets
were
provided
against
the
gathering
darkness
by
cylindrical
lanterns
marked
with
the
crests
of
various
at
last
we
came
to
one
of
the
bastioned
gateways
of
the
outer
moat
and
after
a
brief
parley
with
the
guard
passed
through
and
out
across
the
bridge
shortly
beyond
our
escort
halted
before
a
grand
gateway
we
had
arrived
at
the
main
entrance
to
the
largest
of
the
belonging
to
the
prince
of
owari
while
our
bearers
carried
us
across
the
stone
bridge
of
the
into
the
lighted
space
before
the
huge
gates
the
old
leader
announced
us
to
the
warden
or
captain
of
the
gate
almost
instantly
the
ponderous
leaves
of
the
gate
swung
open
before
us
and
a
dozen
owari
hastened
out
to
open
the
and
salute
their
occupants
yoritomo
met
their
smiles
and
kowtowings
and
noisy
insuckings
of
breath
with
an
austere
dignity
that
i
took
pains
to
imitate
but
to
my
surprise
he
accepted
a
pair
of
the
lacquered
clogs
that
were
brought
for
us
and
proceeded
to
leave
his
catching
my
look
he
explained
in
english
am
yet
to
be
made
heir
and
as
a
younger
son
i
lack
the
rank
required
of
one
permitted
to
ride
in
through
the
rank
is
known
i
replied
is
yet
to
be
established
i
will
make
a
start
here
and
now
you
know
that
in
my
country
there
is
no
man
of
better
blood
than
myself
i
will
not
enter
your
gateway
except
in
my
are
right
the
point
is
shrewdly
taken
he
assented
and
he
spoke
gravely
to
the
gate
warden
the
retainer
accepted
the
statement
of
his
son
without
a
trace
of
hesitancy
and
i
was
carried
in
beneath
the
carved
and
lacquered
crossbeams
of
the
gateway
with
yoritomo
walking
beside
my
the
sandals
of
and
bearers
clattered
on
the
stone
flags
of
the
broad
courtyard
within
the
gate
crossing
this
court
we
passed
up
a
slope
and
through
an
ornamental
fence
into
a
second
court
before
the
mansion
of
the

wings
and
high
hedges
flanked
the
main
building
in
such
manner
that
we
could
have
seen
nothing
of
the
gardens
even
had
the
day
still
lingered
i
was
however
more
than
satisfied
by
the
vision
of
the
palace
though
the
building
was
of
only
one
story
the
roof
flung
up
its
twisted
gables
against
the
sky
with
an
effect
of
airy
height
while
the
rows
of
lanterns
hung
to
the
outcurving
eaves
shed
their
soft
glow
over
the
artistic
balustrades
and
polished
planking
of
verandas
wider
than
those
of
zozoji
in
the
centre
of
the
fa√ßade
was
a
grand
portico
of
wood
supported
by
carved
beams
and
pillars
lacquered
in
vivid
colors
young
pages
came
out
to
salute
us
and
spread
mats
for
us
to
step
upon
i
emerged
from
my
yoritomo
returned
our
thanks
to
the
old
for
the
courtesy
of
satsuma
and
stepped
from
his
clogs
onto
the
mats
beside
me
as
the
bearers
and
escort
turned
back
to
the
gate
an
elderly
chamberlain
in
richest
costume
appeared
from
within
and
kowtowed
before
us
mindful
of
my
lessons
in
etiquette
i
drew
out
my
sheathed
sword
and
handed
it
to
the
official
as
he
rose
he
took
the
priceless
weapon
reverently
and
raised
it
to
his
forehead
before
giving
it
into
the
keeping
of
one
of
the
pages
yoritomo
handed
his
own
sword
to
a
second
page
and
addressed
the
chamberlain
curtly
my
august
father
be
informed
of
our
arrival
what
name
shall
i
announce
my
companion
asked
the
chamberlain
my
friend
as
one
entitled
to
sit
at
the
left
hand
of
the
prince
of
fujimaro
bowed
us
into
the
keeping
of
a
second
chamberlain
and
slipped
noiselessly
away
over
the
white
mats
the
newcomer
kowtowed
and
at
a
word
from
yoritomo
conducted
us
in
through
a
vestibule
lined
with
halberds
lances
equipage
armor
and
to
a
passage
the
pages
with
our
swords
followed
at
a
respectful
distance
two
or
three
turns
brought
us
to
the
brightly
illuminated
of
a
bath
as
we
entered
several
attendants
saluted
and
began
waiting
on
us
rising
from
their
knees
only
when
necessary
when
my
hat
was
removed
one
man
gave
a
gasp
of
amazement
otherwise
all
preserved
their
bland
smiles
throughout
my
disrobing
too
well
trained
to
venture
any
comments
upon
my
skin
but
etiquette
did
not
prevent
them
from
uttering
soft
exclamations
of
grief
and
pity
when
the
removal
of
dress
disclosed
a
deep
cut
across
his
shoulder
blade
though
no
longer
bleeding
the
wound
gaped
open
to
the
bone
yet
with
spartan
fortitude
yoritomo
silenced
their
cries
and
ordered
them
to
proceed
with
me
when
in
turn
he
had
received
his
cold
rub
and
hot
immersion
he
at
last
permitted
the
chamberlain
to
bind
up
the
wound
with
moistened
strips
of
the
tough
japanese
paper
blind
shampooers
reinvigorated
our
muscles
with
their
skilful
rubbing
other
attendants
shaved
us
dressed
our
hair
and
attired
us
in
gorgeous
ceremonial
costume
including
white
silk
socks
and
the
jackets
called
last
of
all
our
dirks
were
thrust
into
our
girdles
and
my
revolvers
and
cartridges
placed
on
a
red
lacquer
tray
to
be
carried
after
us
with
our
swords
fujimaro
appeared
to
conduct
us
into
the
presence
of
the
prince
we
followed
him
through
corridors
flanked
by
rooms
varying
in
size
but
all
alike
in
their
mats
the
beautiful
pictures
on
their
and
the
artistic
fretwork
in
the
space
between
the
and
the
ceiling
throughout
the
palace
the
woodwork
was
in
natural
finish
without
paint
or
varnish
yet
polished
until
the
exquisitely
grained
surface
shimmered
like
watered
silk
at
the
anteroom
of
the
hall
of
audience
two
more
chamberlains
kowtowed
and
ushered
us
forward
at
the
head
of
the
room
there
was
an
impressive
pause
the
chamberlains
could
not
have
looked
more
solemn
had
they
been
ushering
us
into
the
presence
of
the
shogun
himself
the
screens
before
us
drew
noiselessly
aside
and
disclosed
a
chamber
somewhat
larger
than
the
anteroom
and
a
slight
step
higher
the
chamberlains
kowtowed
at
the
threshold
and
crept
forward
on
their
knees
we
followed
erect
to
our
left
midway
up
the
room
knelt
six
dignified
counsellors
the
daimio
awaited
us
seated
turk
fashion
upon
a
low
dais
before
a
so
far
as
i
could
judge
of
his
figure
within
the
loose
robes
he
was
tall
and
slender
he
wore
a
small
beard
and
mustache
whose
snowy
whiteness
contrasted
with
his
tall
black
cap
of
cobwebby
tissue
his
long
face
had
a
stern
and
saturnine
expression
and
he
bore
himself
with
austere
stateliness
as
the
chamberlains
neared
the
dais
they
kowtowed
and
drew
to
one
side
we
advanced
and
knelt
and
yoritomo
kowtowed
resolved
to
maintain
equality
with
the
prince
i
went
no
further
than
a
low
bow
as
i
straightened
the
prince
gazed
keenly
into
my
blue
eyes
and
after
a
pause
returned
my
bow
i
was
received
as
a
of
the
first
class
the
kneeling
chamberlains
waved
me
to
the
cushion
on
the
left
of
the
prince
and
yoritomo
to
the
cushion
on
his
right
our
swordbearers
slid
around
to
the
and
placed
our
swords
upon
the
rack
of
honor
below
the
glittering
helmet
and
armor
at
a
sign
from
the
prince
the
page
bearing
my
revolvers
and
cartridges
set
his
tray
before
us
the
solemn
silence
which
had
prevailed
since
our
entrance
continued
while
attendants
glided
in
with
sweetmeats
and
a
tea
service
of
china
when
we
had
been
served
the
daimio
signed
all
the
retainers
except
his
counsellors
to
withdraw
and
broke
the
silence
by
politely
inquiring
my
name
age
and
family
guest
is
adamisu
woroto
sama
answered
yoritomo
for
me
is
a
of
the
great
people
whose
land
is
called
america
his
age
is
the
same
as
my
own
in
all
america
there
is
no
family
of
higher
blood
than
the
family
of
my
friend
and
benefactor
he
held
honorable
rank
under
the
government
of
america
but
laid
aside
office
and
has
come
with
me
to
aid
dai
the
prince
looked
across
to
the
group
of
counsellors
and
the
aged
or
chief
counsellor
responded
to
the
wordless
inquiry
without
moving
lord
in
the
legacy
of
iyeyasu
it
is
forbidden
to
harbor
a

to
the
ancient
edict
all
christians
shall
be
imprisoned

of
iyeyasu
also
forbids
that
any
man
shall

of

your
son
has
travelled
beyond
the
shores
of
nippon
he
has
traversed
the
five
continents
and
proved
the
truth
of
the
dutch
learning
by
sailing
around
the
vast
circuit
of

said
the
wording
of

men
of

fishermen
have
been
received
back
from
ships
and
forgiven
their
unintended
crime
but
according
to
his
own
words
yoritomo
sama
left
the
shore
of
nippon
with
intent
to
contravene
the
ancient
edict
by
bringing
back
the
knowledge
of
the
my
lord
the
enforcement
of
the
laws
has
been
lax
in
recent
years
there
has
been
much
blinking
at
the
study
of
the
dutch
learning
yet
the
laws
stand
ready
for
enforcement
against
my
lord
and
yoritomo

the
honorable
guest
should
enemies
of
my
lord
make
demand
upon
midzuano
chief

the
elder

for
a
hearing
has
already
gone
to
the
household
in
the
of
the
princess
azai
replied
yoritomo
and
without
naming
kohana
he
told
succinctly
how
we
had
discovered
and
defeated
the
mito
plot
the
daimio
and
his
counsellors
listened
throughout
with
an
impassiveness
of
manner
which
i
should
have
mistaken
for
indifference
had
i
not
been
near
enough
to
see
the
glow
in
the
jet
eyes
of
the
prince
at
the
end
of
the
account
the
great
man
murmured
his
comments
in
a
voice
that
vibrated
with
suppressed
exultance
all
that
you
have
done
my
son
i
see
the
guidance
of
the
gods
and
of
the
spirits
of
our
forefathers
the
mito
men
walk
with
faces
over
their
shoulders
looking
to
the
past
and
with
ears
closed
against
all
reports
of
the
disasters
brought
upon
the
chinese
by
a
like
policy
the
true
cause
of
the
mikado
owes
much
to
your
service
and
the
service
of
this
noble
have
broken
the
law
i
have
brought
danger
upon
the
house
of
owari
said
yoritomo
alone
should
receive
punishment
and
not
my
family
shall
it
be
or
shall
i
strip
off
the
tokugawa
crest
and
as
a
seek
to
accomplish
my
mission
aided
only
by
my
brother
his
father
looked
across
at
the
counsellors
and
the
old
responded
without
a
hesitancy
sama
has
in
truth
been
guided
by
the
ancestral
spirits
of
owari
chief
and
clan
should
stand
or
fall
in
the
support
of
the
heir
of
murmured
yoritomo
then
is
the
truth
men
have
been
making
secret
search
for
you
throughout
nippon
answered
the
prince
a
month
your
elder
brother
has
lain
sick
beyond
hope
of
recovery
his
son
is
yet
a
child
the
strong
man
has
come
to
succeed
the
sick
heir
the
death
of
your
brother
will
be
to
give
way
to
grief
in
the
presence
of
a
superior
is
a
most
serious
breach
of
japanese
etiquette
the
graver
the
grief
or
pain
the
more
pronounced
the
smile
of
the
sufferer
yoritomo
uttered
a
soft
laugh
and
immediately
turned
the
conversation
to
a
less
painful
subject
lord
he
said
have
told
how
woroto
sama
received
me
aboard
the
black
ship
and
how
he
proved
himself
the
generous
friend
and
brother
of
the
stranger
we
believe
the
saying
that
the
spirits
of
our
ancestors
are
ever
about
us
here
is
proof
only
a
day
past
woroto
sama
informed
me
that
he
is
a
descendant
of
anjin
anjin
sama
repeated
the
prince
even
his
austere
reserve
shaken
by
the
statement
i
bowed
to
mask
my
curiosity
the
news
of
my
ancestry
could
not
be
other
than
interesting
to
any
one
acquainted
with
the
romantic
history
of
will
adams
but
why
should
the
announcement
to
this
oriental
prince
create
such
a
sensation
he
looked
at
me
with
a
slight
smile
and
asked
his
son
woroto
sama
know
has
yet
to
be
informed
my
the
prince
turned
to
his
is
written
in
the
records
of
owari
regarding
anjin
sama
the
counsellor
of
minamoto
iyeyasu
lord
it
is
written
that
the
fourth
daimio
of
owari
took
to
wife
the
daughter
of
brother
nagato
the
wife
of
nagato
was
the
daughter
of
anjin
the
saturnine
face
of
the
prince
relaxed
in
a
kindly
smile
and
yoritomo
bowed
to
me
in
grave
salute
brother
now
sees
that
it
was
immutable
fate
which
drew
us
together
in
the
bonds
of
friendship
we
are
blood
accustomed
as
are
we
of
the
south
to
trace
out
the
ties
of
family
through
all
its
ramifications
i
was
astonished
at
this
recognition
of
cousinship
through
so
remote
an
ancestor
especially
as
i
knew
the
japanese
hold
strictly
to
the
male
line
but
if
the
princely
house
of
owari
was
inclined
to
receive
me
as
a
member
of
the
clan
and
family
it
was
not
for
me
to
repudiate
the
connection
the
daimio
spoke
to
the
counsellors
heir
of
the
prince
of
owari
is
entitled
to
present
his
memorial
direct
to
the
shogun
see
that
yoritomo
sama
is
registered
at
zozoji
in
the
place
of
his
elder
brother
who
is
about
to
go
from
the
counsellors
kowtowed
and
glided
from
the
room
yoritomo
addressed
his
father
with
a
shade
of
anxiety
beneath
his
smile
lord
i
can
not
go
before
the
shogun
during
my
time
of
mourning
yet
the
black
ships
may
come
any
the
memorial
i
myself
will
present
it
to
the
shogun
in
private
audience
replied
the
prince
one
of
the
screens
of
the
side
wall
slipped
open
and
there
entered
a
slender
little
old
lady
in
silk
she
was
the
first
aged
woman
i
had
yet
seen
in
japan
whose
features
retained
a
share
of
youthful
beauty
her
face
was
as
exquisitely
refined
and
almost
as
fair
as
that
of
the
daughter
while
her
teeth
owing
either
to
greater
skill
in
the
application
or
to
better
dye
were
of
a
glossy
black
not
altogether
unpleasing
even
to
my
occidental
ideas
of
attractiveness
softly
as
a
thistledown
she
drifted
across
the
mats
and
knelt
before
yoritomo
her
lips
parted
in
a
smile
that
went
far
beyond
the
demands
of
etiquette
tears
of
joy
glided
down
her
soft
cheeks
and
in
her
eyes
was
a
look
of
mother
love
and
devotion
that
made
all
clear
to
me
no
less
deep
and
overpowering
was
joy
at
sight
of
his
mother
his
tears
flowed
quite
as
freely
yet
there
followed
no
outburst
of
caressing
words
no
kisses
and
fond
embraces
weeping
and
smiling
in
decorous
quiet
they
kowtowed
to
one
another
and
murmured
formal
words
of
greeting
in
the
midst
yoritomo
composed
himself
to
introduce
me
as
his
friend
and
benefactor
and
a
distant
kinsman
of
the
family
she
welcomed
me
with
exquisite
courtesy
a
girl
appeared
with
a
light
refreshment
of
tea
and
covered
with
a
sauce
of
red
beans
and
sugar
this
the
princess
served
to
us
herself
with
a
daintiness
that
would
have
drawn
from
me
more
than
one
compliment
had
i
not
been
aware
that
my
fine
phrases
would
have
been
considered
an
outrageous
breach
of
etiquette
when
the
little
lady
had
withdrawn
with
her
assistant
the
prince
unbent
entirely
from
his
austere
reserve
and
in
a
most
genial
manner
showered
upon
me
a
hundred
and
one
politely
personal
inquiries
as
to
my
opinions
and
ideas
behind
the
mask
of
solemn
state
i
found
him
a
gentleman
as
cordial
as
he
was
dignified
and
as
kindly
disposed
as
he
was
noble
minded
returning
to
the
fight
with
the
he
spoke
wonderingly
of
my
audacious
resort
to
firearms
within
the
bounds
of
yedo
and
insisted
that
i
should
show
him
the
action
of
my
revolvers
the
weapons
greatly
pleased
him
and
he
obtained
my
promise
to
fire
them
the
next
day
in
one
of
the
archery
walks
of
the
after
this
mindful
of
our
need
of
rest
he
touched
a
small
gong
and
ordered
the
chamberlain
fujimaro
who
responded
to
conduct
me
to
apartments
occupying
one
of
the
wings
of
the
palace
chapter
xiv
before
the
shogun
for
several
days
i
lived
in
strict
seclusion
a
wing
of
the
palace
surrounded
by
one
of
the
most
beautiful
of
the
landscape
gardens
within
the
had
been
set
apart
for
my
use
all
my
wants
were
attended
to
by
a
faultlessly
polite
corps
of
retainers
and
servants
fujimaro
the
chamberlain
acted
as
my
and
incidentally
as
my
instructor
in
language
and
etiquette
much
as
i
had
derived
both
consciously
and
unconsciously
from
my
intimacy
with
yoritomo
i
soon
found
that
i
had
made
no
more
than
a
fair
beginning
in
the
intricacies
and
niceties
of
one
of
the
most
difficult
of
languages
and
of
the
most
complicated
of
all
existing
codes
of
etiquette
that
of
china
not
excepted
my
teacher
proved
to
be
invariably
cordial
and
interested
but
no
less
invariably
formal
and
precise
in
his
demeanor
towards
the
the
prince
who
came
to
walk
with
me
in
the
garden
each
day
was
still
more
formal
whenever
any
of
his
retainers
were
present
at
other
times
as
when
i
showed
him
a
little
pistol
practice
in
the
seclusion
of
a
rockery
he
unbent
to
me
as
to
a
peer
always
faultlessly
polite
and
dignified
yet
flatteringly
attentive
to
my
conversation
during
this
time
i
saw
nothing
of
his
wife
the
quaintly
beautiful
little
lady
tokiwa
sama
the
family
life
of
the
japanese
nobility
is
extremely
private
even
as
regards
relatives
yoritomo
found
time
to
pay
me
only
one
brief
visit
he
was
dressed
in
white
the
japanese
mourning
and
was
greatly
worn
by
his
labor
in
preparing
his
memorial
to
the
shogun
during
the
nights
and
his
daytime
duties
as
chief
mourner
for
his
brother
japanese
etiquette
does
not
permit
the
official
mourning
of
parents
for
children
upon
yoritomo
had
fallen
the
sorrowful
task
of
receiving
the
family
friends
at
the
bier
of
his
brother
and
of
attending
to
all
the
buddhistic
and
shinto
funeral
rites
the
day
after
our
arrival
the
death
of
his
brother
had
been
officially
announced
and
the
corpse
which
had
been
embalmed
in
vermilion
for
a
month
past
was
mourned
over
for
the
prescribed
number
of
days
before
the
interment
in
one
of
the
cemeteries
at
shiba
in
the
meantime
my
friend
had
completed
a
summary
of
the
knowledge
he
had
acquired
regarding
the
outer
world
and
the
new
foreign
policy
to
which
that
knowledge
pointed
he
was
now
writing
the
full
report
and
memorial
while
his
father
who
had
already
smuggled
the
summary
into
the
castle
was
intriguing
for
permission
to
present
the
memorial
direct
to
the
shogun
unknown
to
midzuano
and
the
other
members
of
the
council
of
elders
as
the
council
was
secretly
pledged
to
the
mito
faction
it
was
necessary
for
us
to
obtain
an
unprejudiced
hearing
from
the
shogun
delay
was
dangerous
since
at
any
moment
keiki
might
invoke
the
ancient
laws
against
us
or
the
inopportune
arrival
of
the
american
expedition
might
checkmate
our
purpose
by
throwing
the
government
into
an
irrevocably
hostile
attitude
towards
the
foreigners
and
ourselves
weary
of
inaction
i
welcomed
a
message
from
the
prince
requesting
me
to
join
him
on
an
informal
visit
where
we
were
to
go
was
not
stated
but
i
accepted
the
invitation
on
the
instant
and
asked
no
questions
my
attendants
dressed
me
with
utmost
care
in
rich
though
garments
and
i
noticed
that
a
ceremonial
winged
jacket
or
of
was
laid
in
a
lacquered
case
to
be
carried
along
when
shortly
after
midday
i
was
led
through
the
palace
to
the
state
portico
i
found
that
the
prince
had
already
entered
his
and
was
being
borne
away
in
the
midst
of
his
cortege
i
stepped
into
my
and
was
borne
after
him
fujimaro
and
other
officials
walking
beside
me
my
and
grooms
my
men
and
the
bearers
of
my
state
umbrella
hat
fan
and
all
the
other
ceremonial
paraphernalia
of
a
were
strung
out
before
or
behind
me
upon
issuing
from
the
we
did
not
cross
the
outer
moat
at
the
nearest
bridge
but
skirted
southward
along
it
to
the
yotsuya
gate
which
opens
into
the
great
kojimachi
street
up
kojimachi
we
swung
at
a
pace
far
brisker
than
dignity
would
have
permitted
had
not
the
absence
of
ceremonial
standards
indicated
that
we
were
travelling
the
incognito
of
the
prince
however
was
no
more
than
a
conventional
fiction
since
his
cortege
was
immediately
recognized
by
every
man
in
the
throngs
of
that
passed
us
within
the
official
quarter
gazing
out
through
my
curtains
i
caught
the
politely
veiled
glances
with
which
the
men
regarded
our
cortege
the
intensity
of
party
feeling
among
them
was
evident
from
the
total
absence
of
indifference
there
was
not
one
who
failed
to
show
indications
of
either
warm
friendship
or
bitter
hatred
this
was
no
less
true
of
the
helmetted
riders
we
met
some
rode
by
with
the
heads
of
their
barbed
and
grotesquely
caparisoned
horses
curved
high
and
the
huge
slipper
stirrups
of
the
saddles
thrust
out
aggressively
others
courteously
swerved
to
the
far
side
of
the
street
and
a
few
even
dismounted
despite
our
conventional
incognito
a
mile
along
the
kojimachi
street
brought
us
to
the
moat
of
the
citadel
i
expected
our
cortege
to
turn
to
the
right
into
the
great
causeway
and
skirt
the
moat
towards
the
sakaruda
gate
where
yoritomo
and
i
had
parted
from
the
cortege
of
the
princess
azai
instead
our
escort
led
straight
on
across
the
bridge
that
headed
the
street
the
thought
flashed
upon
me
that
we
were
about
to
enter
the
sacred
enclosure
and
call
upon
one
of
the
high
officials
of
the
household
on
either
side
i
looked
down
over
the
waters
of
the
beautiful
moat
among
whose
lotus
pads
swarmed
ducks
and
geese
swans
ibises
storks
and
cranes
the
outer
bank
rose
to
the
causeway
in
a
steep
grassy
slope
set
with
oaks
and
pines
nearing
the
far
side
i
studied
at
close
view
the
granite
blocks
of
the
citadel
wall
many
of
which
measured
at
least
four
feet
by
sixteen
they
were
neatly
fitted
together
without
mortar
or
iron
cramps
and
showed
no
crevices
or
displacements
from
the
earthquakes
of
three
centuries
at
the
head
of
the
bridge
our
cortege
halted
and
fujimaro
informed
me
that
i
was
to
alight
the
prince
as
the
head
of
one
of
the
august
three
families
was
entitled
to
ride
in
through
this
lesser
gate
but
no
other
could
be
accorded
the
privilege
well
i
replied
determined
to
make
a
test
of
the
matter
the
prince
of
owari
proceed
i
will
wait
his
return
my
lord
exclaimed
the
chamberlain
take
me
back
to
the
i
demanded
prince
was
pleased
to
receive
me
as
a
of
rank
equal
to
his
own
i
will
enter
the
citadel
in
the
same
manner
that
he
enters
or
not
at
this
was
a
bold
stand
for
a
foreigner
whose
very
presence
in
japan
was
against
the
ancient
laws
but
my
natural
disposition
to
insist
upon
a
correct
valuation
of
my
dignity
was
backed
by
a
careful
consideration
of
japanese
manners
and
customs
as
an
american
gentleman
i
had
the
right
to
rank
myself
as
an
equal
to
any
one
beneath
the
ruler
of
the
country
to
accept
a
lower
station
would
result
in
humiliations
that
i
was
not
disposed
to
suffer
either
from
white
men
or
brown
there
followed
a
prolonged
conference
between
the
captain
of
the
gate
the
chamberlain
and
the
prince
during
which
fujimaro
twice
came
back
and
begged
me
to
change
my
determination
i
refused
the
gate
captain
in
turn
refused
to
admit
the
unknown
occupant
of
the
second
other
than
on
foot
the
deadlock
that
followed
was
broken
by
the
appearance
of
a
whom
i
at
once
recognized
as
the
only
member
of
the
guard
except
the
leader
that
had
survived
the
attack
of
the
his
dress
indicated
that
he
had
been
promoted
to
the
rank
of
court
chamberlain
he
had
come
to
conduct
us
into
the
citadel
and
at
a
word
from
him
the
obstinate
gate
captain
yielded
his
will
to
mine
we
moved
forward
beneath
the
huge
ancient
gateway
into
a
small
court
between
the
lofty
bastions
and
out
at
right
angles
through
an
inner
gateway
into
the
marvellously
beautiful
gardens
of
the
shogun
after
winding
about
for
half
a
mile
or
more
among
hillocks
and
rockeries
and
groves
interspersed
with
kiosks
and
temples
we
came
to
the
wall
and
moat
that
surrounds
the
o
shiro
here
the
prince
and
i
left
our
and
walked
over
a
slender
bridge
accompanied
only
by
our
chamberlains
and
the
newly
made
court
chamberlain
who
had
ostentatiously
ushered
us
from
the
citadel
gate
in
compliance
with
the
request
of
the
prince
i
walked
behind
him
as
if
lost
in
meditation
my
head
downbent
and
eyes
narrowed
to
a
line
at
the
far
side
of
the
bridge
we
passed
between
the
vigilant
guards
of
the
inner
gateway
who
however
seemed
to
detect
nothing
foreign
in
my
appearance
beyond
them
we
came
into
a
garden
court
surrounded
with
high
walls
on
three
sides
and
on
the
fourth
with
a
wing
of
the
palace
there
was
no
person
to
be
seen
either
in
the
court
or
in
the
broad
veranda
of
the
palace
wing
to
which
we
were
conducted
mounting
a
set
of
movable
lacquered
steps
we
crossed
the
veranda
to
the
threshold
of
a
small
waiting
room
when
our
clogs
had
been
removed
the
prince
handed
over
not
only
his
sword
but
his
dirk
as
well
into
the
keeping
of
his
chief
attendant
the
act
convinced
me
that
we
were
about
to
be
received
by
the
shogun
himself
it
was
absurd
to
suppose
that
one
of
so
exalted
a
rank
as
the
prince
would
lay
aside
his
dirk
as
well
as
his
sword
for
any
personage
in
yedo
other
than
the
head
of
the
government
fujimaro
did
not
have
to
ask
twice
for
my
swords
i
handed
them
over
at
the
first
word
we
entered
and
seated
ourselves
the
court
chamberlain
kowtowed
and
withdrew
and
our
attendants
proceeded
to
slip
on
our
winged
jackets
and
adjust
our
court
caps
these
were
odd
affairs
not
unlike
inverted
boats
in
shape
and
were
tied
on
the
crown
of
our
heads
with
cords
passing
under
our
chins
our
chamberlains
then
handed
us
the
ceremonial
fans
and
withdrew
to
the
lower
end
of
the
room
after
a
short
wait
the
court
official
reappeared
and
bowed
to
the
prince
and
myself
we
rose
and
followed
him
through
a
deserted
corridor
into
a
large
square
room
where
he
signed
us
to
kneel
on
three
mats
below
the
cushions
in
front
of
the
he
slipped
out
again
by
the
way
he
had
entered
drawing
shut
the
screen
behind
him
there
followed
a
wait
of
ten
or
fifteen
minutes
during
which
i
sought
to
quiet
my
apprehensions
as
to
the
outcome
of
the
audience
with
this
mysterious
oriental
potentate
by
studying
the
exquisite
cabinetwork
and
decorations
of
the
room
i
was
admiring
the
priceless
vase
which
shared
the
floor
of
the
with
a
common
stone
when
the
prince
drew
in
his
breath
with
a
soft
sibilation
and
kowtowed
until
his
forehead
pressed
the
floor
a
quick
glance
showed
me
a
gap
between
the
screens
of
the
side
wall
through
which
was
entering
a
portly
man
in
yellow
and
black
in
his
girdle
were
thrust
a
sword
and
dirk
that
glittered
with
gold
fretwork
but
the
cap
or
hat
on
the
crown
of
his
head
was
of
plain
black
lacquer
the
salute
of
the
prince
was
however
quite
sufficient
to
convince
me
that
we
were
in
the
presence
of
the
shogun
i
kowtowed
beside
my
companion
we
maintained
our
salute
until
the
shogun
had
seated
himself
on
the
cushioned
dais
before
the
and
commanded
us
to
rise
as
we
straightened
and
sat
back
on
knees
and
heels
i
was
astonished
to
perceive
that
we
were
alone
with
this
exclusive
and
jealously
guarded
ruler
of
the
most
exclusive
and
jealously
guarded
empire
on
earth
but
i
had
heard
too
much
about
the
ways
of
oriental
potentates
to
doubt
that
palace
guards
waited
within
instant
call
behind
the
frail
barrier
of
the
wall
screens
petition
of
yoritomo
sama
for
permission
to
present
a
memorial
through
owari
dono
has
been
received
and
read
he
began
in
a
clear
colorless
voice
summary
of
the
intended
memorial
of
yoritomo
sama
has
been
received
but
not
read
the
legacy
of
iyeyasu
forbids
the
reading
of
documents
or
letters
that
refer
to
will
of
minamoto
iyeyoshi
is
the
delight
of
his
servants
exclaimed
the
prince
smiling
as
though
he
had
received
a
favor
inquiry
be
made
whether
the
tycoon
has
laid
the
matter
before
the
elder
council
if
the
shogun
was
flattered
by
the
adulatory
chinese
title
which
properly
belonged
only
to
the
mikado
there
was
nothing
to
indicate
the
fact
in
his
stern
look
he
replied
curtly
council
has
not
yet
been
though
so
ungraciously
stated
i
divined
that
this
answer
implied
a
point
in
our
favor
and
i
smiled
quite
as
suavely
as
the
prince
the
shogun
turned
his
gloomy
eyes
upon
me
in
a
fixed
stare
as
a
matter
of
courtesy
i
was
willing
to
conform
to
the
etiquette
of
the
country
but
i
was
not
inclined
to
cringe
before
any
man
no
thought
of
insolence
or
bravado
entered
my
mind
the
rank
of
this
oriental
ruler
entitled
him
to
my
respect
i
met
his
look
with
the
calm
and
steady
gaze
with
which
a
gentleman
regards
a
new
acquaintance
the
experiment
was
not
lacking
in
danger
deference
is
the
breath
of
life
to
the
normal
oriental
potentate
but
the
pride
of
race
and
family
is
hard
to
overcome
even
though
expediency
counsel
a
subservient
attitude
i
could
not
have
humbled
myself
had
i
desired
the
event
proved
that
minamoto
iyeyoshi
was
far
other
than
a
typical
tyrant
his
dark
eyes
lighted
and
he
expressed
his
opinion
of
me
with
royal
conciseness
american
is
i
bowed
in
acknowledgment
highness
is
pleased
to
be
gracious
permit
me
to
speak
for
one
who
is
my
friend
a
man
who
for
the
sake
of
his
country
laid
aside
riches
and
rank
and
at
the
risk
of
life
and
honor
crossed
the
seas
to
search
out
the
secrets
of
power
your
highness
do
the
records
of
heroes
tell
of
any
nobler
deed
of
courage
and
devotion
legacy
of
iyeyasu
may
not
be
altered
he
replied
highness
i
said
the
days
of
your
august
ancestor
iyeyasu
sama
dai

has
stood
still
among
the
nations
of
the
earth
while
all
the
world
has
rolled
forward
even
china
stirs
from
the
sleep
of
cycles
the
time
has
come
for
the
people
of
nippon
to
learn
that
the
are
neither
beasts
nor
demons
nor
even
barbarians
your
highness
the
son
of
the
wise
prince
of
owari
honored
me
with
his
friendship
for
the
sake
of
that
friendship
i
have
come
with
him
to
nippon
to
advise
the
altering
of
the
laws
of
counsellor
in
the
shogunate
highness
may
recall
one
precedent
i
replied
sama
listened
to
the
counsel
of
anjin
sama
my
the
curiosity
in
the
eyes
deepened
without
a
trace
of
change
in
his
impassive
face
he
glanced
inquiringly
at
my
companion
who
responded
in
a
tone
of
calm
conviction
sama
the
favorite
and
most
trusted
counsellor
of
our
august
ancestor
has
returned
in
a
new
birth
to

claim
is
made
by
myself
your
highness
i
answered
am
not
conscious
that
my
soul
is
the
soul
of
anjin
but
i
know
that
i
am
lineally
descended
from

his
english
son

owari

me
with
an
acknowledgment
of

bowed
in
confirmation
face
darkened
is
a
believer
in
the
accursed
sect
highness
is
mistaken
i
replied
sect
denounced
by
your
laws
is
that
body
of
christians
which
acknowledges
the
rule
of
the
pope
of
rome
there
are
many
christian
sects
which
reject
the
christian
sects
seek
to
subvert
filial
piety
and
the
reverent
worship
of
the
august
ancestors
upon
which
rest
the
foundations
of
morality
and
highness
i
ventured
may
be
the
foundations
of
order
and
morality
the
life
of
nations
depends
either
upon
the
power
to
meet
force
with
force
or
the
wisdom
to
avoid
conflict
for
generations
dai
nippon
has
been
safe
owing
to
her
isolation
from
the
lands
beyond
the
wide
seas
but
now
the
peoples
have
attained
to
a
power
inconceivable
to
one
who
has
not
seen
their
warships
cover

replied
the
warships
of

without

against
the
greatest
of
typhoons
and
their
cannon
shoot
far
your
highness
may
have
heard
of
chinese
arrogance

said

the
chinese

at

its

your

that
the
government
of
my
country
is
sending
a
very
great
official
honorably
to
request
that
the

of
your
highness
do
not
judge
by
the
dutch
they
are
now
a
very
little
people
in
the
world
in
the
august
name
of
minamoto
iyeyasu
and
in
the
name
of
anjin
sama
his
counsellor
i
ask
minamoto
iyeyoshi
to
receive
and
ponder
on
the
memorial
of
yoritomo
prayer
of
woroto
will
be
considered
replied
the
shogun
and
with
this
half
concession
he
touched
a
small
gong
that
stood
beside
him
on
an
elbow
rest
chapter
xv
requital
in
quick
response
to
the
signal
the
chamberlain
who
had
conducted
us
to
the
palace
entered
at
the
side
of
the
room
over
his
feet
and
a
yard
behind
trailed
a
grotesque
prolongation
of
his
trouser
legs
that
gave
him
the
appearance
of
walking
on
his
knees
i
supposed
he
had
been
summoned
to
usher
us
out
but
when
he
crept
forward
on
hands
and
knees
and
kowtowed
the
shogun
commanded
harshly
at
the
gengo
report
has
been
made
that
he
committed
the
crime
of
firing
a
gun
within
the
bounds
of
yedo
speak
the
the
chamberlain
raised
his
head
a
little
above
the
floor
and
stared
across
at
me
his
face
gray
with
fear
beneath
its
set
smile
highness
he
murmured
truth
can
not
be
concealed
this
is
the
who
in
company
with
yoritomo
son
of
owari
dono
fired
many
shots
from
a
little
gun
the
like
of
which
has
never
before
been
seen
in
yedo
your
highness
knows
that
i
had
no
share
in
the
crime
yuki
was
captain
of
the
cortege
and
the
responsibility
interrupted
the
shogun
in
as
the
fellow
crept
from
the
room
i
stared
after
him
astounded
that
fear
could
so
debase
one
who
had
outmatched
by
his
skill
and
braveness
the
armored
he
had
stood
unflinching
before
the
bloody
swords
that
had
cut
down
his
comrades
yet
now
at
the
bare
intimation
that
his
lord
was
displeased
with
me
crawled
away
without
venturing
a
word
in
favor
of
the
whose
crime
had
saved
him
from
death
and
his
princess
from
the
disgrace
of
capture
i
turned
to
the
prince
expecting
him
to
burst
into
warm
protests
against
the
injustice
of
the
attitude
he
sat
in
placid
silence
his
face
wreathed
in
the
polite
smile
of
the
japanese
courtier
yet
i
knew
that
he
could
not
be
indifferent
ruin
to
me
would
spell
ruin
to
yoritomo
determined
not
to
be
outdone
in
i
composed
myself
and
faced
the
shogun
with
the
same
forced
smile
of
etiquette
iyeyoshi
regarded
me
with
an
inscrutable
look
though
his
features
were
as
impassive
as
if
cast
in
golden
bronze
i
fancied
a
sinister
mockery
behind
the
cold
curiosity
of
his
gaze
i
felt
as
a
mouse
must
feel
between
the
paws
of
the
cat
i
had
been
so
foolish
as
to
leave
my
revolvers
in
my
apartments
i
was
absolutely
in
the
power
of
this
ruler
i
thought
of
all
the
hideous
medi√¶val
tortures
still
in
practice
in
this
benighted
land
and
a
cold
sweat
oozed
out
upon
my
skin
and
chilled
me
yet
i
maintained
my
smile
noiselessly
as
a
shadow
a
girl
glided
across
the
room
and
prostrated
herself
before
the
shogun
it
was
the
younger
of
the
princess
ladies
iyeyoshi
muttered
a
command
she
raised
her
head
a
few
inches
and
spoke
rapidly
but
in
tones
so
soft
and
low
i
could
only
conjecture
that
she
was
giving
a
detailed
account
of
the
attack
and
defeat
of
the
throughout
the
recital
the
shogun
held
to
his
cold
scrutiny
of
my
face
i
continued
to
smile
at
the
end
he
signed
her
to
go
in
turning
about
she
cast
at
me
a
glance
of
modest
interest
and
i
thought
there
was
friendliness
in
her
smile
she
glided
out
as
noiselessly
as
she
had
entered
there
was
a
pause
and
another
girl
glided
in
to
prostrate
herself
before
the
shogun
a
girl
still
more
graceful
and
lissome
dressed
in
crepes
of
gossamer
texture
i
stared
in
amazement
my
heart
skipping
a
beat
and
then
bounding
with
a
force
that
sent
a
flood
of
color
into
my
face
the
girl
was
the
daughter
the
princess
azai
the
full
truth
commanded
the
shogun
with
the
barest
suggestion
of
tenderness
beneath
his
stern
tone
is
not
the
first
time
you
have
seen
the
highness
she
murmured
in
a
voice
as
clear
and
musical
as
it
was
low
appeared
before
me
first
below
the
holy
image
of
kwannon
at
zozoji
i
thought
him
a
god
or
a
spirit
again
he
appeared
in
the
midst
of
the
attack
by
the
evil
and
then
i
knew
him
to
be
a
hero
such
as
are
told
of
in
the
ancient
privilege
of
rulers
is
to
honor
heroes
said
the
shogun
and
he
made
a
sign
with
his
fan
azai
glided
to
the
opening
in
the
screens
and
returned
with
a
tea
tray
of
unvarnished
cypress
wood
which
she
held
above
her
white
brow
until
she
had
knelt
to
set
it
before
her
father
having
served
him
she
glided
across
again
to
return
with
a
tray
and
service
of
vermilion
lacquer
this
she
brought
to
the
prince
holding
it
not
so
high
as
the
first
tray
last
of
all
she
came
to
serve
me
in
precisely
the
same
manner
as
my
tray
and
service
and
ceremonial
were
identical
in
other
words
i
was
received
by
the
shogun
as
a
personage
of
rank
equal
to
that
of
the
prince
of
owari
but
i
gave
scant
thought
to
this
triumph
of
diplomacy
when
i
looked
down
upon
the
quaint
coiffure
and
slender
figure
of
the
kowtowing
girl
as
she
straightened
from
the
salute
and
still
upon
her
knees
bent
forward
to
offer
me
my
tea
and
sweetmeats
her
eyes
rose
to
mine
in
a
timid
glance
by
good
fortune
i
was
able
to
restrain
my
tongue
but
i
could
not
withhold
from
my
gaze
the
adoration
which
overwhelmed
me
at
this
close
view
of
her
exquisite
purity
and
loveliness
i
had
barely
a
glimpse
of
the
soft
eyes
purpling
with
emotion
then
the
lids
drooped
their
long
lashes
and
a
scarlet
blush
leaped
into
her
ivory
cheeks
yet
with
consummate
grace
and
composure
she
maintained
her
delicious
little
smile
of
greeting
and
served
me
without
a
falter
her
blush
passed
as
swiftly
as
it
had
come
but
it
left
me
stunned
and
dizzy
with
the
realization
that
i
loved
this
divinely
sweet
and
innocent
maiden
the
daughter
of
the
proud
ruler
of
nippon
the
promised
bride
of
my
true
friend
tomo
she
was
as
far
beyond
my
reach
as
the
silvery
moon
what
of
that
love
does
not
reason
even
in
the
midst
of
my
shame
at
the
thought
of
my
friend
i
found
myself
unable
to
resist
the
mad
longing
to
win
the
lovely
girl
my
infatuated
gaze
could
not
have
escaped
the
keen
eyes
of
her
father
and
the
prince
to
my
surprise
instead
of
reproving
me
with
word
or
look
they
sipped
their
tiny
cups
of
tea
as
fast
as
the
little
princess
could
refill
them
and
exchanged
cryptic
verses
from
the
chinese
classics
the
poetic
contest
continued
until
we
had
finished
our
refreshment
and
azai
had
withdrawn
with
her
trays
the
shogun
quoted
a
last
verse
and
turned
upon
me
with
pedagogical
severity
gives
no
heed
to
the
golden
words
of
the
chinese
sage
highness
i
replied
ignorance
of
confucius
is
the
sole
test
regard
me
as
a
barbarian
less
than
two
years
have
passed
since
i
began
the
study
of
your
language
with
yoritomo
the
matter
of
learning
woroto
sama
is
a
scholar
interposed
the
prince
a
true
in
battle
added
the
shogun
with
a
graciousness
that
i
must
confess
relieved
me
not
a
little
highness
i
asked
inquiry
is
admissible
there
were
two
who
lived
to
see
the
flight
of
the
both
fought
with
utmost
skill
and
as
you
have
seen
has
been
promoted
answered
the
shogun
did
all
that
his
position
called
for
yuki
as
captain
of
the
cortege
was
guilty
of
falling
into
an
ambush
in
consideration
of
his
loyal
valor
his
life
has
been
mercifully
spared
and
his
punishment
limited
to
degradation
from
the
service
of
the
only
with
utmost
difficulty
could
i
maintain
my
set
smile
here
was
bitter
requital
for
service
the
loyal
and
courageous
made
a
and
beggared
because
of
a
surprise
which
he
had
no
shadow
of
reason
to
anticipate
says
that
one
of
the
traitors
was
taken
alive
remarked
the
prince
permission
given
to
inquire
criminal
refused
to
speak
and
so
died
under
a
shudder
passed
through
me
at
the
terse
reply
i
called
to
mind
what
i
had
read
of
rack
and
boot
and
fire
and
all
the
other
hideous
tortures
of
medi√¶val
court
procedure
the
prince
must
have
been
bitterly
disappointed
he
laughed
softly
and
ventured
another
inquiry
is
rumored
that
the
band
came
from
the
were
formerly
in
the
service
of
mito
replied
the
shogun
declarations
found
upon
their
bodies
state
that
they
had
foresworn
their
loyalty
to
their
lord
and
intended
to
strike
a
blow
against
the
shogunate
in
favor
of
the
temporal
power
of
the
name
for
fame
rhymed
the
prince
the
verse
was
not
improbably
a
paraphrase
of
a
classic
couplet
and
must
have
contained
an
allusion
beyond
the
bare
meaning
of
the
words
face
darkened
with
a
double
suspicion
years
have
passed
since
the
prince
of
mito
was
compelled
to
resign
his
to
his
eldest
son
and
confine
himself
in
his
inferior
yedo
he
stated
enemies
have
yet
to
furnish
clear
proof
that
his
casting
of
bells
into
cannon
was
not
for
the
conquest
of
the
ainos
and
the
glory
of
the
shogunate
as
was
claimed
by
walks
with
face
to
the
past
and
eyes
turned
upward
murmured
the
prince
mito
has
yet
sat
on
the
stool
of
the
high
commander
of
armies
but
neither
was
hideyoshi
the
taiko
sama
made
shogun
he
held
a
higher
title
in
the
court
and
was
supreme
general
in
fact
though
not
in
name
is
it
for
the
glory
of
our
holy
mikado
or
for
the
elevation
of
keiki
that
mito
plots
the
overthrow
of
the
shogunate
stung
to
fury
by
the
bare
mention
of
the
threatened
disaster
to
his
rule
iyeyoshi
bent
forward
his
face
distorted
with
murderous
rage
and
his
hand
clutching
at
the
hilt
of
his
dirk
the
prince
still
smiling
under
the
menace
of
instant
death
kowtowed
and
waited
on
hands
and
knees
with
his
neck
bared
for
the
blade
does
a
loyal
subject
offer
life
in
confirmation
of
sincerity
he
murmured
the
blood
curdled
in
my
veins
as
the
full
horror
of
the
moment
burst
upon
me
unsoftened
by
my
submissiveness
the
shogun
thrust
back
his
long
sleeve
with
his
left
hand
and
tightened
his
grip
on
the
dirk
his
eyes
narrowed
to
cruel
slits
i
knew
there
would
be
only
one
movement
a
flashing
stroke
from
the
scabbard
that
would
sever
the
outstretched
neck
of
the
prince
in
the
same
instant
i
realized
that
the
death
of
the
father
would
mean
death
to
the
son
and
the
ruin
of
what
he
valued
far
above
life
his
mission
i
had
pledged
myself
to
help
yoritomo
and
i
loved
his
betrothed
what
had
i
to
live
for
highness
i
gasped
do
not
know
all
your
customs
in
china
a
condemned
man
may
sometimes
receive
punishment
through
a
substitute
accept
my
life
for
the
life
of
my
kinsman
the
shogun
turned
his
glittering
eyes
upon
me
they
were
as
cold
and
hard
and
malignant
as
the
eyes
of
an
enraged
snake
yet
the
same
impulse
that
had
forced
my
offer
now
impelled
me
to
creep
nearer
to
him
fearful
that
he
might
refuse
to
accept
i
did
not
realize
that
my
interference
was
in
itself
an
outrage
upon
the
dignity
of
the
shogun
punishable
with
death
first
the
prince
then
myself
the
bared
arm
of
the
despot
twitched
suddenly
the
distorted
face
relaxed
and
the
hand
on
the
hilt
drew
away
either
my
offer
had
penetrated
through
the
crust
of
ceremonialism
to
the
wellsprings
of
his
nature
or
at
the
very
height
of
his
rage
he
had
recalled
to
mind
the
power
of
the
friendly
owari
party
and
remembered
that
even
he
had
no
lawful
right
to
punish
a
of
the
first
class
other
than
by
deposition
with
the
sanctioning
assent
of
the
mikado
amida
butsu
he
murmured
is
an
evil
counsellor
be
seated
the
offends
with
his
uncouth
manners
and
unsmiling
face
yet
he
has
proved
his
high
sense
of
loyalty
and
the
filial
duty
owing
to
his
elder
kinsman
i
am
highness
has
spared
two
unworthy
lives
replied
the
prince
loyalty
of
my
counsel
is
still
doubted
grant
me
leave
to
withdraw
that
i
may
make
proof
of
again
a
feeling
of
horror
seized
me
and
brought
the
cold
sweat
to
my
face
the
gruesome
proof
of
sincerity
was
i
recalled
the
suicide
of
the
wounded
and
i
shuddered
no
not
even
for
sake
could
i
offer
this
sacrifice
of
myself
for
his
father
i
had
not
been
trained
from
childhood
in
the
stern
code
still
on
hands
and
knees
i
stared
up
at
the
clouded
face
of
the
shogun
in
agonized
suspense
at
last
the
clear
gaze
and
unchanging
smile
of
the
prince
won
the
contest
against
doubt
and
suspicion
sincerity
of
owari
dono
is
not
questioned
replied
the
shogun
but
the
prince
was
still
unsatisfied
remains
doubt
regarding
the
wisdom
of
humbly
offered
counsel
he
insisted
is
granted
owari
dono
to
present
the
memorial
of
yoritomo
sama
which
will
be
read
and
considered
came
the
welcome
response
we
kowtowed
together
loudly
insucking
our
breath
to
express
our
gratitude
and
delight
the
shogun
rose
and
we
again
kowtowed
while
he
left
the
room
a
screen
in
the
side
wall
opened
before
him
and
closed
again
without
a
sound
we
were
once
more
alone
as
we
settled
back
on
our
heels
the
prince
commended
me
for
my
part
in
the
successful
outcome
of
the
audience
with
a
glance
of
warm
approval
i
could
not
restrain
an
exultant
exclamation
won
he
can
not
resist
facts
the
prince
touched
his
lips
and
signed
to
the
rear
a
shadow
passed
across
my
face
i
had
not
heard
even
a
rustle
of
silken
folds
yet
gengo
the
court
chamberlain
was
already
beside
me
he
kowtowed
and
murmured
in
a
tone
of
ingratiating
obsequiousness
august
princes
are
implored
to
accept
the
humble
services
of
their
servant
the
condescension
of
the
great
fills
with
joy
the
breast
of
the
lowly
duties
of
a
court
chamberlain
restrict
his
services
to
his
lord
replied
my
companion
i
had
taken
a
dislike
to
the
man
despite
my
remembrance
of
his
braveness
and
swordsmanship
but
i
thought
the
prince
spoke
with
undue
harshness
heedless
of
the
reproof
gengo
looked
up
with
a
fawning
smile
and
answered
significantly
men
have
accepted
aid
from
wise
man
trusts
in
the
gods
and
scorns
the
goblin
power
of
badgers
and
foxes
rejoined
the
prince
opens
gates
that
steel
can
not
force
my
gates
that
are
already
open
may
crush
those
who
attempt
to
close
gengo
cringed
and
looked
up
with
a
bland
smile
favor
of
the
exalted
prince
of
owari
will
be
remembered
by
his
servant
he
murmured
and
he
kowtowed
laughing
softly
and
sucking
his
breath
the
prince
signed
me
to
rise
gengo
rose
after
us
and
ushered
us
out
by
the
way
we
had
come
with
utmost
obsequiousness
in
the
waiting
room
our
caps
and
winged
jackets
were
removed
by
our
chamberlains
who
slipped
on
our
lacquered
clogs
at
the
threshold
gengo
conducted
our
party
out
across
the
inner
moat
and
through
the
palace
gardens
to
the
gate
in
the
citadel
rampart
there
at
last
he
turned
back
while
we
swung
out
across
the
great
moat
and
homeward
along
kojimachi
street
to
bear
the
good
news

strikes
a
second
period
of
anxious
waiting
followed
the
visit
to
the
palace
yoritomo
soon
completed
his
memorial
which
his
father
at
once
presented
to
the
shogun
after
that
we
had
to
wait
in
blind
uncertainty
of
the
outcome
yet
aware
that
the
mito
party
was
gathering
all
its
strength
to
bring
about
the
downfall
and
destruction
of
owari
on
the
morning
of
july
the
sixth
yoritomo
came
to
my
apartments
for
the
first
long
visit
he
had
been
free
to
pay
me
since
our
arrival
at
owari
yashiki
as
soon
as
the
attendants
had
served
pipes
and
tea
and
had
withdrawn
he
sought
to
repeat
the
fervent
thanks
which
he
had
already
showered
on
me
for
my
impulsive
attempt
to
save
his
father
i
could
no
longer
bear
his
gratitude
tomo
i
interrupted
have
a
confession
to
make
i
am
ashamed
to
receive
your
praises
the
least
i
can
do
is
to
confess
the
bitter
truth
i
love
your
little
i
not
already
know
that
he
replied
brother
i
grieve
for
you
me
rather
when
i
looked
into
her
madonna
face
i
could
not
resist
showing
her
my
love
to
her
your
betrothed
and
i
thought
myself
a
gentleman
betrothed
only
in
name
worth
how
often
have
i
told
you
that
my
life
has
been
given
if
you
succeed
he
touched
his
dirk
know
the
customary
proof
of
sincerity
if
that
is
not
required
i
have
vowed
to
shave
my
head
and
enter
the
monastery
at
no
tomo
i
protested
your
chances
for
a
glorious
future
if
we
win
against
mito
only
the
life
of
the
feeble
son
of
the
shogun
stands
between
you
and
the
succession
to
the
throne
as
the
husband
of
the
daughter
and
heir
of
owari
with
the
strong
friendship
of
satsuma
is
the
saying
of
your
great
poet
he
interrupted
lies
the
head
that
wears
a
neither
power
nor
love
tempt
me
if
now
i
can
subdue
my
hatred
of
mito
and
his
clan
and
fulfil
my
mission
with
a
buddhist
saint
if
you
must
but
when
you
have
accomplished
your
mission
your
gods
will
reward
you
with
a
happy
souls
have
met
and
loved
in
some
former
reincarnation
he
murmured
off
all
thought
of
shame
brother
i
have
no
desire
for
the
maiden
you
belong
to
one
another
your
souls
are
bound
together
i
cried
and
i
bowed
over
between
shame
and
intoxicating
delight
fujimaro
entered
with
the
freedom
allowed
a
teacher
and
said
in
his
most
formal
style
to
enter
the
august
presence
is
humbly
entreated
by
a
woman
of
low
degree
the
yoritomo
nodded
to
me
and
i
answered
her
in
without
as
fujimaro
glided
out
i
bent
towards
yoritomo
with
a
quick
question
of
plots
that
be
a
matter
of
surprise
he
replied
with
his
placid
smile
will
soon
tell
us
we
were
talking
of
one
to
whom
you
have
given
your
heart
with
true
occidental
romanticism
i
grieve
for
you
brother
i
should
have
betrayed
my
friend
not
that
i
have
never
stood
between
you
and
the
maiden
in
wish
and
will
not
in
fact
i
grieve
because
i
know
that
your
love
is
hopeless
in
this
life
at
the
best
you
have
only
the
chance
to
unite
yourselves
in
death
and
even
that
union
is
no
more
than
a
remote
death
i
repeated
lovers
know
there
is
no
hope
of
union
in
this
life
they
pledge
themselves
to
love
one
another
for
seven
existences
and
again
he
touched
his
dirk
hilt
i
cried
her
to
sacrifice
herself
for
me
westerners
talk
of
faith
we
practise
it
azai
will
gladly
end
her
life
here
for
the
bliss
of
being
joined
to
you
in
the
world
beyond
she
loves
i
am
a
the
very
sight
of
me
frightened
the
first
yes
now
she
loves
you
my
father
saw
your
soul
in
her
i
repeated
for
you
to
be
united
in
this
life
he
repeated
the
less
she
is
yours
so
far
as
love
gives
you
the
right
and
she
is
yours
so
far
as
the
wish
of
your
brother
is
to
be
you
will
help
me
will
he
waved
back
my
outstretched
hand
fujimaro
opened
a
screen
for
kohana
san
to
enter
and
at
a
sign
from
me
withdrew
the

not
paused
to
cast
off
her
hood
and
gray

panting
from
haste
and

she
glided
across
to

on
her
knees

unsmiling

she
gasped

ordered
our

yoritomo

no

a
delayed
message
came
from
the
yuki
who
was
captain
of
the
keiki
sought
to
bribe
him
against
us
he
pretended
to
agree
yoritomo
twisted
about
to
my
and
opened
the
lacquered
case
in
which
i
kept
my
revolvers
and
ammunition
he
thrust
one
of
the
revolvers
into
his
bosom
and
gave
me
the
other
must
stand
before
the
judges
without
our
swords
he
said

dignity
of
the
court
but
we
can
not
tell
how
far
keiki
and
midzuano
may
induce
them

better
to

unable
to
repress
the
note
of
horror
that
underlaid
his

for

fujimaro
hastened
out
and
we
turned
to
question
kohana
san
before
she
could
tell
how
the
message
had
reached
her
the
chamberlain
reappeared
and
announced
that
one
of
the
personal
attendants
had
come
to
inform
us
our
presence
was
desired
in
the
audience
hall
strikes
it
is
for
us
to
parry
and
counter
said
yoritomo
we
slipped
our
swords
into
our
girdles
and
rose
at
the
threshold
he
turned
to
kohana
san
to
the
war
god
and
to
your
thousand
felicitous
years
to
my
lord
she
murmured
might
of
hachiman
and
the
craft
of
the
cat
shall

him
the
waiting
attendant
conducted
us
direct
to
the
audience
hall
his
unsmiling
face
a
portent
of
calamity
at
the
entrance
he
halted
and
kowtowed
we
passed
in
alone
the
prince
was
seated
in
state
before
the
grand
and
close
beside
him
on
his
left
sat
a
visitor
also
dressed
in
winged
jacket
a
large
and
swarthy
man
with
features
of
the
heavy
german
type
when
we
entered
refreshments
had
been
served
and
the
only
retainers
present
were
the
six
counsellors
yoritomo
led
me
to
the
head
of
the
room
where
we
knelt
and
laid
our
swords
upon
the
mats
at
our
right
and
exchanged
bows
with
the
prince
and
his
guest
i
had
no
need
of
my
greeting
to
the
stranger
to
divine
his
identity
i
had
already
perceived
from
the
circle
cross
upon
his
coat
and
his
position
on
the
left
of
the
prince
that
he
was
none
other
than
friend
shimadzu
nariakira
the
great
daimio
of
satsuma
accepting
the
precedent
set
by
the
prince
he
greeted
me
as
his
junior
but
peer
and
proceeded
to
look
me
over
with
a
gaze
as
frank
and
kindly
as
it
was
keen
sama
is
far
different
in
appearance
from
the
hairy
that
i
have
seen
on
the
black
ships
he
said
august
prince
of
owari
has
told
me
the
deeds
of
his
guest
my
regret
is
yoritomo
glanced
inquiringly
at
his
father
who
explained
with
utmost
calmness
of
tone
and
manner
noble
friend
the
daimio
of
satsuma
has
received
the
command
of
the
shogunate
to
bring
the
heir
of
owari
and
the
lord
before
the
high
court
in
netted
in
a
flash
yoritomo
drew
open
his
robes
below
the
girdle
and
placed
the
point
of
his
dirk
to
his
side
ready
for
the
fatal
cross
cut
calm
and
steady
as
if
cast
in
bronze
he
looked
up
at
his
father
for
the
signal
to
strike
the
prince
turned
quietly
to
his
guest
the
daimio
sat
mute
and
impassive
the
prince
faced
the
counsellors
who
consulted
together
for
what
seemed
to
me
an
age
of
hideous
suspense
yet
throughout
it
all
the
prince
and
the
daimio
waited
to
all
appearance
as
apathetic
as
lumps
of
clay
while
my
friend
crouched
no
less
impassive
in
look
the
cruel
knife
held
ready
to
rend
his
loins
in
dreadful
at
last
the
spoke
in
a
voice
devoid
of
all
emotion
words
of
the
august
lords
have
been
heard
and
considered
humble
counsel
is
given
that
yoritomo
sama
should
bear
the
present
shame
and
should
risk
appearance
before
the
high
court
to
commit
now
would
save
his
personal
honor
it
would
not
be
proof
of
sincerity
should
doubt
be
expressed
as
to
his
motive
in
presenting
the
memorial
to
his
highness
the
the
prince
nodded
in
assent
yoritomo
still
waited
the
shogun
know
of
this
order
he
asked
we
have
yet
to
learn
answered
the
prince
risk
is
great
so
also
is
the
chance
of
great
yoritomo
sheathed
his
dirk
and
tendered
both
it
and
his
sword
to
the
daimio
i
offered
my
sword
and
dirk
the
daimio
smiled
gravely
and
waved
them
back
with
his
fan
shall
all
lay
aside
our
swords
when
we
enter
the
presence
of
the
high
court
he
said
the
prince
clapped
his
hands
and
attendants
entered
to
take
up
the
swords
of
the
four
lords
the
prince
himself
escorted
his
powerful
guest
to
the
state
portico
yoritomo
and
i
following
close
after
at
the
entrance
with
satsuma
bearers
and
guards
were
stationed
in
waiting
for
us
before
the
palanquin
of
the
daimio
with
no
other
display
of
feeling
than
the
required
smile
of
etiquette
we
took
leave
of
the
prince
slipped
our
swords
into
our
girdles
and
entered
our
the
head
of
the
cortege
passed
out
into
the
great
courtyard
and
through
the
massive
gateway
followed
by
and
then
by
my
own
each
surrounded
by
a
guard
of
stalwart
satsuma
men
the
daimio
came
after
us
near
the
end
of
the
procession
outside
the
gateway
the
heralds
began
to
chant
a
monotonous
cry
kneel
down
kneel
as
my
swung
around
i
peered
out
and
saw
the
standard
bearers
carrying
the
insignia
of
their
lord
on
tall
shafts
the
daimio
of
satsuma
was
making
a
state
progress
the
thought
that
we
were
in
the
charge
of
the
most
powerful
of
all
the
and
that
he
was
our
friend
reassured
my
apprehensions
of
the
coming
ordeal
i
drew
a
sigh
of
relief
and
was
about
to
settle
back
in
my
narrow
box
when
something
struck
lightly
across
the
and
fell
down
over
the
windows
i
peered
out
again
and
saw
the
meshes
of
a
net
chapter
xvii
in
the
pit
of
torment
the
ride
would
have
been
tedious
at
best
with
that
symbolic
net
hung
over
me
it
was
unendurable
more
than
once
the
indignity
of
being
paraded
as
a
prisoner
through
the
aristocratic
section
of
yedo
all
but
overpowered
my
only
by
the
severest
repression
was
i
able
to
constrain
myself
from
drawing
sword
and
cutting
my
way
out
of
my
enmeshed
palanquin
the
saving
thought
was
that
satsuma
had
left
us
our
swords
and
that
the
net
did
not
necessarily
imply
degradation
with
the
heralds
ever
chanting
their
cry
down
kneel
down
we
marched
in
solemn
state
into
the
official
quarter
and
slantingly
across
it
past
the
great
sakaruda
gate
where
we
had
parted
from
the
cortege
of
the
princess
to
a
gate
in
the
angle
of
the
moat
half
a
mile
beyond
here
i
expected
an
order
for
us
to
dismount
and
enter
afoot
but
the
gate
led
us
into
the
second
castle
which
is
the
separately
moated
portion
of
the
official
quarter
lying
along
the
east
side
of
the
citadel
we
now
had
to
go
only
a
short
distance
to
reach
the
in
which
the
magistrates
of
the
supreme
or
high
court
held
their
sessions
as
prisoners
of
high
rank
we
were
carried
in
through
the
gateway
and
across
the
courtyard
to
the
portico
the
daimio
followed
in
state
when
he
had
stepped
out
upon
the
mats
laid
for
him
by
the
attendants
of
the
court
the
nets
were
removed
from
our
and
we
were
courteously
assisted
to
alight
beside
the
daimio
at
a
sign
from
him
we
handed
over
our
swords
and
dirks
to
a
pair
of
his
own
retainers
while
he
gave
his
sword
alone
into
the
keeping
of
one
of
the
with
this
we
were
ushered
after
the
daimio
into
a
and
served
with
tea
and
rice
cakes
an
extreme
of
ceremonial
hospitality
for
which
i
felt
more
impatience
than
gratitude
we
had
good
reason
to
believe
that
those
who
so
politely
entertained
us
were
our
enemies
that
we
were
going
before
a
prejudiced
court
i
wondered
how
yoritomo
could
preserve
his
tranquil
bearing
for
myself
i
found
much
difficulty
in
imitating
the
austere
solemnity
of
satsuma
whose
deportment
i
had
resolved
to
copy
in
my
perturbed
state
of
mind
the
task
was
by
no
means
easy
yet
i
succeeded
so
far
as
visibly
to
impress
the
with
the
dignity
of
the
lord
at
last
we
were
summoned
into
the
presence
of
the
court
the
trial
chamber
was
an
apartment
of
medium
size
divided
into
a
pit
level
with
the
ground
below
the
mansion
and
a
matted
platform
or
continuation
of
the
house
floor
three
or
four
feet
higher
than
the
pit
bottom
upon
the
centre
of
the
platform
sat
the
magistrates
in
a
row
with
several
court
secretaries
or
reporters
on
their
right
turning
my
glance
from
the
judges
i
stared
down
into
the
space
before
them
with
a
thrill
of
horror
along
the
walls
of
the
pit
were
ranged
grotesquely
modelled
instruments
and
machines
the
very
shape
of
which
was
a
menace
and
a
torment
before
them
stood
guards
armed
with
hooked
and
forked
implements
used
to
entangle
and
pin
down
unruly
prisoners
worst
of
all
were
the
three
men
of
the
or
pariah
class
who
knelt
beside
a
post
in
the
centre
of
the
pit
grim
and
silent
their
cotton
robes
tucked
up
into
their
girdles
their
corded
arms
bared
to
the
shoulder
the
three
swordbearers
knelt
in
a
corner
while
satsuma
was
conducted
to
a
cushion
on
the
left
of
the
magistrates
he
seated
himself
and
exchanged
bows
with
a
lean
who
had
preceded
him
a
signed
us
to
descend
a
steep
flight
of
steps
into
the
pit
without
a
shadow
of
change
in
his
serene
face
yoritomo
led
the
way
down
at
the
bottom
attendants
slipped
lacquered
clogs
upon
our
feet
that
we
might
not
soil
our
silk
upon
the
stone
flagging
we
halted
near
the
steps
yet
close
enough
to
the
post
where
the
pariahs
stood
for
me
to
see
a
splotch
of
fresh
blood
on
the
flagstones
at
its
foot
yoritomo
saw
me
shudder
and
whispered
reassuringly
in
english
brother
we
have
the
pistols
and
there
will
be
no
attempt
at
torture
if
we
tell
the
truth
conceal
nothing
except
our
knowledge
of
i
drew
in
a
deep
breath
and
turned
my
gaze
away
from
the
pit
to
look
at
the
magistrates
they
were
studying
me
with
a
supercilious
curiosity
such
as
a
lady
of
fashion
might
exhibit
while
viewing
a
painted
savage
pride
spurred
me
out
of
the
black
mood
of
horror
and
despair
into
which
i
had
sunk
with
chin
uplifted
i
returned
the
insolence
of
the
judges
in
a
contemptuous
glance
yet
intense
as
was
my
anger
i
found
myself
almost
disconcerted
when
i
met
the
gaze
of
the
beside
satsuma
his
face
was
as
immobile
as
a
and
his
dull
eyes
peered
out
at
me
through
the
narrow
lids
with
a
glassy
stare
as
cold
and
emotionless
as
the
eyes
of
a
corpse
is
that
beside
your
friend
i
muttered
chief
of
the
elder
council
whispered
yoritomo
i
stared
closer
at
the
repellent
face
this
then
was
midzuano
the
grand
vizier
or
premier
our
enemy
and
the
friend
of
mito
what
chance
had
we
of
a
fair
trial
before
a
court
influenced
if
not
overawed
by
the
ally
of
those
who
sought
our
destruction
according
to
the
ancient
law
of
the
land
we
had
committed
deeds
punishable
with
death
what
possibility
could
there
be
for
us
to
escape
condemnation
by
a
court
acting
in
the
interests
of
our
enemies
son
of
owari
dono
called
one
of
the
secretaries
and
he
signed
with
his
fan
yoritomo
stepped
forward
before
the
judges
and
bowed
to
them
with
grave
dignity
another
secretary
lifted
a
sheet
of
writing
to
his
forehead
and
read
slowly
have
been
made
that
yoritomo
son
of
owari
dono
left
the
shores
of
nippon
that
he
has
returned
to
the
shores
of
nippon
from
the
lands
of
the
and
that
he
has
brought
with
him
into
the
country
a
who
belongs
to
the
evil
the
reading
of
the
brief
indictment
was
followed
by
a
profound
hush
in
which
the
only
sound
i
could
hear
was
the
quick
drumming
of
my
heart
the
silence
was
broken
by
one
of
the
magistrates
who
leaned
forward
and
asked
sharply
has
yoritomo
sama
to
say
to
the
charges
the
secretaries
wetted
their
inkbrushes
and
wrote
down
the
question
with
swift
strokes
they
did
not
have
long
to
wait
for
answer
he
smiled
up
into
the
faces
of
those
who
were
about
to
condemn
him
and
replied
without
a
trace
of
hesitancy
the
first
and
second
charges
no
proof
can
be
brought
forward
by
the
august
court
yet
i
speak
freely
the
truth
many
years
have
passed
since
word
came
from
nagasaki
how
the
hairy
had
humbled
the
pride
of
the
arrogant
chinese
and
forced
them
with
cannonballs
to
open
their
ports
to
trade
that
is
well
known
to
all
men
of
is
well
known
assented
the
magistrate
yoritomo
bowed
and
continued
i
had
attained
to
manhood
i
chanced
upon
a
full
account
of
the
victory
and
humiliation
the
realization
that
a
like
humiliation
might
come
to
the
sacred
empire
of
the
rising
sun
sobered
me
in
the
midst
of
drunken
revels
i
put
on
pilgrim
dress
and
journeyed
to
the
holy
shrine
of
ise
there
i
prayed
for
enlightenment
the
high
ones
sent
me
a
vision
in
which
i
was
directed
to
cross
the
seas
and
learn
the
secrets
of
power
i
waited
my
opportunity
and
embarked
in
one
of
the
black
accomplices
demanded
the
magistrate
who
had
spoken
before
had
no
accomplices
i
boarded
the
black
ship
unknown
to
any
person
in
this
at
nagasaki
on
the
dutch
ship
or
on
one
of
the
chinese
junks
asked
another
magistrate
neither
nor
was
it
at
was
it
queried
the
first
judge
is
not
to
be
told
replied
my
friend
the
magistrates
conferred
together
in
low
murmurs
after
a
time
one
of
them
signed
with
his
fan
to
the
torturers
as
the
men
advanced
yoritomo
folded
his
arms
and
faced
them
though
i
knew
his
hand
was
gripped
on
the
revolver
under
the
edge
of
his
robe
there
was
no
shade
of
change
perceptible
in
his
serene
face
i
folded
my
arms
and
reached
in
to
grip
my
own
revolver
the
magistrate
nearest
midzuano
leaned
towards
him
as
though
to
catch
some
faintly
whispered
remark
the
leading
torturer
reached
out
to
grasp
shoulder
the
magistrate
raised
his
fan
in
a
restraining
gesture
and
said
authoritatively
the
point
rest
for
the
present
the
prisoner
has
confessed
to
the
first
charge
make
note
that
according
to
his
own
statement
he
left
the
shores
of
nippon
he
was
not
driven
to
sea
by
storm
but
boarded
a
ship
of
the
and
sailed
from
nippon
of
his
own
free
the
guidance
of
the
gods
and
for
the
sake
of
the
holy
mikado
added
yoritomo
one
of
the
judges
murmured
a
protest
but
the
last
speaker
signed
to
the
secretaries
down
the
claim
of
the
prisoner
he
ordered
the
second
charge
it
is
proved
by
the
confession
of
the
first
yoritomo
son
of
owari
dono
left
the
shores
of
nippon
he
now
stands
before
us
therefore
he
has
returned
to
nippon
there
remains
the
third
as
to
my
return
to
nippon
replied
yoritomo
make
defence
that
having
learned
much
of
the
peoples
and
their
power
i
come
back
not
in
defiance
of
the
edict
but
as
a
loyal
subject
to
counsel
the
shogunate
against
the
mistakes
of
note
that
the
prisoner
confesses
his
return
to
nippon
for
the
purpose
of
counselling
the
shogunate
with
the
forbidden
knowledge
of
the
barbarians
said
the
magistrate
nearest
midzuano
he
turned
to
yoritomo
and
repeated
remains
the
third
third
charge
is
false
replied
my
friend
woroto
my
august
kinsman
is
not
a
member
of
the
evil
kinsman
kinsman
repeated
yoritomo
and
he
gave
a
terse
account
of
will
adams
his
relations
with
the
great
iyeyasu
and
his
descendants
the
magistrates
listened
with
intense
interest
but
the
recital
instead
of
softening
them
seemed
to
quicken
their
suspicions
one
of
them
signed
to
the
torturers
and
commanded
the
again
i
gripped
my
revolver
certain
that
the
time
had
come
my
first
ball
should
rid
the
world
of
the
chief
counsellor
midzuano
after
that
as
many
of
the
perjured
judges
as
there
might
be
time
to
remove
from
office
before
the
need
of
putting
a
ball
through
my
own
brain
how
could
yoritomo
stand
so
serene
one
of
the
torturers
hastened
across
the
pit
and
returned
with
a
bronze
plate
which
he
cast
down
on
the
stone
flagging
before
my
friend
commanded
a
judge
yoritomo
smiled
and
struck
the
face
of
the
plate
with
one
of
his
clogs
a
slight
smile
gleamed
across
the
heavy
face
of
satsuma
midzuano
betrayed
no
sign
either
of
relief
or
disappointment
the
magistrates
conferred
the
one
who
had
spoken
at
the
beginning
of
the
trial
nodded
to
the
secretaries
full
note
that
the
prisoner
denies
the
third
charge
and
has
trod
upon
the
image
he
may
step
as
yoritomo
crossed
to
the
far
end
of
the
pit
the
judge
signed
to
me
with
his
fan
to
come
forward
i
advanced
and
stood
facing
the
magistrates
with
head
high
and
arms
folded
little
did
they
suspect
that
their
fate
was
in
my
hands
not
mine
in
theirs
angered
by
the
defiant
stare
of
my
blue
eyes
the
youngest
judge
commanded
harshly
down
white
devil
lords
do
not
kneel
to
the
servants
of
a
servant
i
rejoined
recalling
to
mind
that
in
theory
if
not
in
practice
the
shogun
is
the
servant
of
the
mikado
the
man
recoiled
before
my
angry
gaze
fearful
of
my
eyes
while
the
magistrate
next
to
him
cried
out
his
indignation
at
my
insolence
but
an
elder
judge
quieted
his
colleagues
with
a
gesture
and
addressed
me
with
calm
severity
barbarian
speaks
with
intolerable
insolence
to
the
high
retainer
of
the
for
civility
insolence
for
insolence
i
rejoined
called
me
you
call
me
you
are
both
foolish
children
pitifully
ignorant
of
the
mighty
civilization
of
the
peoples
i
have
come
to
nippon
with
yoritomo
sama
he
interrupted
let
the
charges
against
the
prisoner
be
a
secretary
raised
the
indictment
to
his
forehead
and
murmured
are
made
that
the
companion
of
yoritomo
son
of
owari
dono
is
a
member
of
the
evil
sect
that
he
has
discharged
a
firearm
within
the
proscribed
limits
about
yedo
and
that
he
is
a
spy
sent
to
nippon
by
the
the
first
charge
i
deny
that
i
am
a
member
of
what
you
call
the
evil
sect
i
stated
one
of
the
judges
pointed
to
the
floor
beside
me
with
a
laconic
command
i
looked
down
at
the
bronze
plate
upon
which
yoritomo
had
trod
so
readily
on
its
smooth
surface
was
incised
a
latin
cross
i
faced
my
judges
again
prepared
for
the
worst
i
was
not
a
roman
catholic
nor
for
that
matter
a
member
of
any
christian
denomination
but
i
did
not
propose
to
spurn
that
symbol
with
my
foot
of
the
charge
has
been
made
i
said
word
of
a
is
sufficient
i
will
not
submit
to
a
foolish
note
the
prisoner
denies
the
first
charge
yet
refuses
to
tread
upon
the
image
called
the
youngest
magistrate
without
attempting
to
hide
his
exultance
forward
the
witness
to
the
second
stand
aside
barbarian
as
i
crossed
to
yoritomo
one
of
the
guards
drew
away
a
screen
at
the
edge
of
the
pit
and
exposed
to
view
a
clumsy
wooden
cage
a
second
guard
opened
the
cage
from
within
crept
a
man
the
guards
caught
him
on
either
side
and
guided
his
tottering
steps
across
to
the
post
though
his
face
was
marked
with
the
effects
of
atrocious
suffering
i
knew
him
at
a
glance
he
was
yuki
the
captain
of
the
cortege
now
beggared
and
degraded
by
a
perverse
judgment
the
freshly
healed
gashes
on
his
chest
and
shoulders
confirmed
his
identity
yuki
the
thought
better
of
his
obduracy
demanded
the
eldest
judge
so
let
him
look
upon
his
and
speak
the
full
yuki
gazed
at
us
for
several
moments
without
betraying
a
sign
of
recognition
truth
has
been
spoken
he
said
facing
the
judges
the
cortege
in
my
charge
was
attacked
by
the
two
swordsmen
in
robes
slew
many
of
the
evil
band
and
put
the
survivors
to
shameful
flight
there
is
no
more
to
be
said
by
instantly
two
of
the
torturers
seized
the
heroic
victim
and
began
lashing
him
to
the
post
the
sight
was
more
than
i
could
endure
i
sprang
forward
and
cried
out
to
the
merciless
judges
question
me
first
if
your
wish
is
to
prove
the
second
charge
against
me
i
admit
that
i
used
a
firearm
prisoner
confesses
to
the
second
charge
commented
the
eldest
judge
defence
of
your
daughter
i
added
that
not
write
commanded
the
judge
call
upon
the
daimio
of
satsuma
to
bear
witness
i
cried
crime
charged
was
committed
in
defence
of
the
daughter
against
the
attack
of
evil
traitors
yet
the
magistrates
refuse
to
make
note
of
the
the
claim
of
the
prisoner
be
noted
ordered
the
judge
i
turned
eagerly
to
the
loyal
martyr
at
the
post
yuki
i
urged
truth
is
now
known
your
testimony
will
work
no
further
is
no

by
me
he
replied

of

refused
to
testify
regarding
the
second
charge
against
the
accused

has
now
been
admitted
the
testimony
is
no

remarked
satsuma
the
judges
conferred
if
any
wished
to
carry
on
the
martyrdom
of
their
victim
to
the
bitter
end
their
lust
for
cruelty
gave
way
before
the
general
eagerness
to
curry
favor
with
the
most
powerful
of
all
the
eldest
judge
bowed
to
him
and
responded

out

sheathed
dirk
and
handing
it
to
an
attendant

with
deliberate
distinctness
this
gift

brave
and
loyal
from
one
who
values
heroic
conduct
ask
him
to
await
me
in
company
with
my
the
torturers
had
already
loosened
their
cords
when
the
attendant
delivered
the
dirk
and
message
yuki
faced
the
and
holding
the
gift
above
his
head
kowtowed
until
his
forehead
touched
the
bloodstained
stones
he
rose
and
staggered
across
the
pit
to
the
steps
where
attendants
hastened
forward
to
support
and
conduct
out
into
the
open
the
man
favored
by
the
great
even
the
magistrates
followed
the
departure
of
their
tortured
victim
with
envious
glances
only
midzuano
the
chief
counsellor
had
not
been
diverted
by
this
touching
incident
and
at
a
whisper
from
him
the
nearest
magistrate
called
to
me
sharply
prisoner
has
yet
to
answer
the
third
i
stepped
back
before
the
centre
of
the
platform
and
replied
of
coming
to
nippon
as
a
spy
i
accompanied
yoritomo
sama
my
friend
for
the
purpose
of
warning
his
country
to
prepare
for
the
appearance
of
my
then
the
disloyal
to
his
country
that
he
asserts
friendship
for
nippon
warships
of
my
country
come
upon
a
peaceful
mission
in
loyalty
to
my
country
and
no
less
in
friendship
to
nippon
i
have
come
before
the
fleet
with
yoritomo
sama
to
counsel
acceptance
of
the
honorable
friendship
offered
to
the
ruler
of
dai
nippon
by
the
exalted
ruler

of
my
country

half
around
the
world
with
a
stately
escort
of
warships
worthy
his
rank
and
his
mission
he
comes
in
peace
with
offers
of
friendship
but
he
is
no
low
tradesman
to
be
turned
from
your
ports
without
a
hearing
of
this
i
have
come
to
warn
nippon
the

distance
of

of

shoot
so
far
the
jeer
goaded
me
beyond
discretion
i
rejoined
are
cities
on
the
shores
of
nippon
unguarded
by
shoals
can
the
shogunate
defend
them
if
not
what
of
the

in
the
eyes
of
those
who
conspire
to
overthrow
the
rule
of
the
tokugawas
even
midzuano
betrayed
his
astonishment
at
so
audacious
a
rejoinder
perhaps
he
was
stung
by
the
consciousness
of
guilt
or
rather
by
the
fear
of
exposure
he
leaned
across
and
whispered
to
the
nearest
magistrate
the
latter
made
a
signal
with
his
fan
and
commanded
there
is
no
need
of
enforced
examination
the
prisoners
have
made
sufficient
confession
they
are
remanded
into
the
charge
of
shimadzu
to

brought
before
the
high
court
for
sentence
i
cried
too
indignant
and
angry
to
feel
thankful
for
our
escape
from
all
attempts
at
torture
yoritomo
clattered
across
the
pit
pavement
and
led
me
to
the
foot
of
the
steps
satsuma
and
the
swordbearers
had
risen
we
shook
off
our
clogs
and
mounted
the
steps
to
follow
the
daimio

of
that
chamber
of
judicial
torment

shadow
of

when
we
came
out
into
the
portico
satsuma
girded
on
his
own
sword
and
in
the
face
of
the
officials
ordered
our
swords
and
dirks
to
be
returned
to
us
we
were
in
his
charge
and
not
yet
under
sentence
next
he
called
yuki
the
before
him
and
ascertained
that
the
injuries
suffered
by
the
brave
man
from
the
torture
though
fortunately
not
of
a
permanent
character
disabled
him
from
walking

distance
the
daimio
demanded
the
use

and
ordered
that

should
be

the
procession
marched
slowly
out
on
its
way
to
the
nearest
satsuma
i
surmised
that
the
court
and
the
council
of
elders
had
thought
to
flatter
the
daimio
by
entrusting
him
with
the
charge
of
the
heir
and
the
guest
of
the
prince
of
owari
if
so
they
had
proved
their
ignorance
of
his
warm
friendship
for
yoritomo
and
must
have
been
both
puzzled
and
chagrined
at
his
courteous
bearing
towards
the
breakers
of
the
law
on
the
other
hand
i
jumped
to
the
rash
conclusion
that
the
great
daimio
would
interpose
himself
between
us
and
our
enemies
and
if
necessary
even
defy
the
court
when
we
entered
one
of
the
lesser
satsuma
within
the
official
quarter
our
could
not
have
welcomed
us
beneath
his
roof
with
greater
state
and
warmer
hospitality
had
we
been
visiting
yoritomo
still
in
mourning
could
not
be
present
at
entertainments
but
i
was
free
to
witness
the
clumsy
contests
of
the
huge
and
bloated
wrestlers
with
which
he
sought
to
amuse
me
while
his
cooks
prepared
a
feast
in
my
honor
after
a
formal
banquet
graced
by
the
exquisite
dancing
of
i
was
shown
to
the
apartment
assigned
to
our
use
much
exhilarated
by
the
merriment
of
the
girls
and
the
many
thimblefuls
of
hot
that
they
had
served
me
though
the
hour
was
close
upon
midnight
i
found
my
friend
kneeling
beside
his
silken
bedquilts
with
his
palms
clasped
in
prayerful
meditation
dieu
what
a
long
face
i
laughed
up
and
dance
a
hornpipe
with
me
jig
till
the
lamps
tumble
in
the
words
of
great
brother
have
met
the
enemy
and
they
are
ours
do
not
understand
brother
he
replied
in
a
tone
that
brought
my
dancing
feet
to
a
sudden
stand
would
appear
that
we
have
escaped
torture
in
our
examination
you
forget
the
many
tortures
inflicted
with
the
death
penalty
i
cried
clutching
the
revolver
through
the
folds
of
my
robe
is
only
one
certain
way
of
escape
open
a
ball
for
you
for
me
he
murmured
i
stared
in
bewilderment
but
satsuma
is
your
friend
he
will
stand
between
can
not
save
us
even
he
dare
not
venture
to
oppose
the
shogunate
in
such
a
only
chance
for
life
is
that
the
shogun
will
take
action
the
sentence
of
the
court
must
be
confirmed
by
the
seal
of
the
council
of
has
that
ready
up
his
sleeve
i
interrupted
with
forced
flippancy
we
are
to
forestall
him
by
the
personal
application
of
ball
and
blade
now
brother
not
until
the
last
extremity
the
shogun
may
interpose
even
after
we
have
been
led
out
to
the
execution
they
will
search
and
bind
us
we
will
be
unable
to
avoid
the
torture
and
shame
i
exclaimed
must
risk
all
for
the
chance
of
sealing
my
memorial
with
my
blood
for
you
there
is
the
hope
of
dying
in
company
with
your
living
and
wedding
her
i
cried
the
risk
of
waiting
till
the
last
they
will
surely
search
and
bind
us
he
replied
and
he
sat
for
some
moments
in
profound
thought
at
the
end
he
clapped
his
hands
and
called
to
the
attendant
who
appeared
presence
of
yuki
the
is
i
seated
myself
beside
my
friend
and
waited
with
such
patience
as
i
could
command
yoritomo
returned
to
his
prayers
presently
a
screen
slipped
open
and
yuki
entered
dressed
in
new
silk
garments
and
already
somewhat
restored
to
strength
by
the
food
and
skilful
treatment
though
just
roused
from
the
midst
of
sleep
he
came
to
us
smiling
and
kowtowed
with
courtly
politeness
thousand
felicitous
years
to
yoritomo
sama
and
to
the
lord
he
murmured
thanks
are
offered
to
the
courageous
swordsmen
who
saved
from
shame
the
daughter
of
minamoto
iyeyoshi
my
lord
heart
of
the
brave
is
loyal
even
in
disgrace
commended
yoritomo
yet
offered
to
receive
the

his
retainers

not
been
made
my
parents
survive
you
have
an
heir
yuki
bowed
to
each
question
yoritomo
nodded
and
continued
is
the
who
can
give
his
life
to
lift
his
parents
from
beggary
to
honored
affluence
whose
heir
has
full
cause
to
stand
before
the
mortuary
tablet
of
his
father
with
grateful
reverence
offer
is
made
to
receive
the
family
of
yuki
the
into
the
service
of
yuki
kowtowed
condescension
of
my
lord
is
above
the
acknowledgment
of
empty
words
command
the
to
return
into
the
hands
of
the
torturers
his
gratitude
may
not
be
expressed
by
the
sacrifice
of
mere
not
martyrdom
is
required
replied
yoritomo
he
drew
the
revolver
from
his
bosom
and
handed
it
to
the
this
in
hiding
with
the
dirk
of
satsuma
when
we
come
from
the
court
be
at
hand
if
we
are
led
out
to
execution
follow
whatever
the
strength
of
the
guard
your
part
is
to
strike
when
i
call
to
you
to
cut
our
bonds
and
hold
back
the
while
we
make
use
of
dirk
and
will
be
no
mistake
loyal
service
is
the
joy
of
a
responded
yuki
yoritomo
crossed
over
to
a
small
writing
table
wrote
swiftly
and
marked
the
paper
with
his
seal
he
returned
and
handed
the
writing
to
the
sunrise
go
with
your
family
to
the
superior
yashiki
of
owari
and
present
this
to
my
august
yuki
raised
the
writing
to
his
forehead
kowtowed
and
withdrew
a
man
i
exclaimed
in
english
suffering
from
the
hellish
work
of
the
torturers
yet
willing
to
rush
to
certain
death
at
a
word
piety
is
the
supreme
virtue
replied
yoritomo
will
serve
his
parents
and
assure
the
survival
of
his
why
not
reward
him
for
what
he
has
already
done
he
has
suffered
enough
why
not
instead
call
upon
one
or
more
of
your
own
deed
would
be
attributed
to
my
father
and
he
will
have
enough
to
withstand
as
it
is
upon
him
alone
will
rest
the
burden
of
barring
the
return
of
mito
to
him
and
he
disheartened
by
the
death
of
your
brother
and
yourself
you
see
no
hope
for
us
tomo
disheartened
but
strengthened
by
the
desire
for
vengeance
come
we
must
i
exclaimed
brings
us
death
if
not
torture
i
had
trusted
to
the
power
and
friendship
of
our
host
but
now
have
sacrificed
yourself
for
the
good
of
an
alien
people
altogether
alien
tomo
i
have
found
myself
strangely
drawn
to
your
people
and
customs
only
this
torture
but
i
suppose
that
has
its
place
in
testing
souls
look
at
this
heroic
yuki
if
by
any
chance
we
escape
tomo
i
want
that
man
for
my
retainer
we
escape
amida
butsu
murmured
my
friend
and
slipping
off
his
outer
robe
he
crept
under
the
silken
coverlet
of
the
bed
he
repeated
and
fell
asleep
in
the
midst
of
the
prayer
between
his
tranquillizing
example
and
the
soporific
of
the
i
had
drunk
i
was
soon
as
sound
asleep
as
yoritomo
and
enjoyed
a
profound
and
refreshing
slumber
until
late
the
following
morning
an
hour
before
noon
we
were
roused
and
waited
upon
by
polite
attendants
having
been
bathed
dressed
and
served
with
food
all
with
a
marked
observance
of
ceremonial
leisure
we
were
ushered
out
to
our
waiting
in
the
portico
our
host
greeted
us
with
utmost
gravity
and
stated
that
every
effort
of
father
to
reach
the
shogun
by
message
or
in
person
had
been
blocked
by
midzuano
my
friend
smiled
would
seem
nariakira
that
i
am
to
go
a
little
sooner
than
i
had
expected
do
not
grieve
for
me
you
know
that
i
had
already
given
my
life
for
the
cause
before
i
came
to
you
in
your
daimiate
consider
only
what
effort
can
be
made
to
save
my
noble
is
always
hope
until
the
sword
falls
said
the
daimio
may
yet
be
saved
am
doomed
replied
yoritomo
will
execute
me
if
only
as
the
son
of
my
father
as
the
heir
of
owari
but
woroto
is
a
stranger
to
the
opposing
clans
they
should
be
satisfied
to
send
him
to
nagasaki
for
the
dutch
ship
to
bear
away
as
it
has
borne
many
of
the
american
so
fast
tomo
i
put
in
one
thing
i
shipped
with
you
for
the
cruise
not
going
to
desert
now
because
on
a
lee
shore
for
another
thing
the
mito
party
is
not
going
to
forgive
my
share
in
defeating
any
way
of
escape
could
be
found
said
the
daimio
sama
would
be
cordially
welcomed
at
the
castle
of
kagoshima
i
would
rejoice
to
receive
and
honor
as
a
teacher
of
my
a
lord
of
such
prowess
and
grateful
thanks
to
the
daimio
of
satsuma
but
i
have
cast
in
my
lot
with
my
friend
and
brother
yoritomo
answer
of
a
true
commended
the
daimio
yoritomo
flashed
me
a
swift
glance
of
affectionate
acknowledgment
and
turned
to
enter
his
a
few
minutes
later
we
were
being
borne
again
through
the
official
quarter
as
netted
prisoners
in
the
stately
cortege
of
our
host
near
the
of
the
court
i
caught
sight
of
a
crouched
in
the
shadow
of
the
wall
he
wore
a
hat
and
was
writing
a
poem
on
a
long
scroll
though
he
did
not
look
up
i
knew
that
yuki
the
was
at
hand
to
perform
his
part
we
entered
the
and
having
handed
over
our
swords
and
dirks
were
at
once
conducted
before
the
magistrate
to
my
surprise
and
relief
the
court
was
convened
in
an
audience
chamber
not
in
the
horrible
trial
room
as
before
midzuano
the
chief
of
the
council
of
elders
sat
at
the
left
of
the
magistrates
satsuma
was
ushered
to
a
place
of
equal
honor
my
relief
was
i
caught
the
dull
cold
stare
of
midzuano
guards
with
hooks
and
forks
closed
in
behind
us
we
were
led
to
the
sill
of
the
raised
floor
upon
which
sat
the
judges
and
down
kowtow
commanded
one
of
the
secretaries
the
servants
of
the
shogun
the
servant
of
the
mikado
called
yoritomo
kneeling
and
bowing
his
forehead
to
the
floor
i
knelt
but
sat
erect
on
my
heels
a
still
greater
insult
to
the
shogunate
than
my
naming
of
the
shogun
as
the
servant
of
the
mikado
there
was
an
angry
murmuring
among
the
judges
but
midzuano
sat
unmoved
and
whispered
quietly
to
his
servile
mouthpiece
he
was
far
more
desirous
of
our
destruction
than
our
disgrace
and
satsuma
had
shown
sympathy
for
us
it
was
expedient
to
regard
the
feelings
of
the
greatest
of
clan
lords
the
magistrate
beside
midzuano
stilled
the
heated
discussion
of
his
colleagues
and
addressed
us
son
of
owari
dono
has
confirmed
the
evidence
of
his
treason
by
his
insolent
reference
to
the
great
tycoon
the
white
barbarian
has
proved
his
uncouth
ignorance
of
etiquette
let
the
sentences
against
the
prisoners
be
one
of
the
secretaries
lifted
a
scroll
to
his
forehead
and
read
son
of
owari
dono
whereas
contrary
to
the
explicit
wording
of
the
ancient
edict
you
voluntarily
departed
from
the
shores
of
dai
nippon
and
returned
bearing
the
forbidden
knowledge
of
the
peoples
the
sentence
of
the
court
is
that
for
this
traitorous
conduct
you
shall
be
borne
to
bell
grove
in
bonds
there
to
be
bound
to
a
cross
and
transfixed
with
spears
and
after
death
your
head
shall
be
struck
off
and
exposed
on
a
in
the
midst
of
the
hush
that
followed
the
reading
yoritomo
smiled
bowed
and
called
out
in
a
clear
voice
favor
of
the
high
magistrates
will
be
remembered
by
the
judges
glanced
furtively
at
midzuano
plainly
troubled
by
the
menace
beneath
the
suavely
ironical
words
the
chief
counsellor
sat
cold
and
unmoved
another
secretary
raised
a
scroll
to
his
forehead
and
read
called
adamisu
woroto
whereas
contrary
to
the
explicit
wording
of
the
ancient
edict
you
a
entered
the
domain
of
the
shogun
to
spy
upon
dai
nippon
and
whereas
you
have
confessed
to
discharging
a
firearm
within
the
bounds
of
yedo
each
of
which
crimes
is
worthy
of
death
the
sentence
of
the
court
is
that
you
shall
be
borne
to
bell
grove
in
bonds
there
to
be
boiled
to
death
in
oil
i
heard
no
more
of
the
hideous
sentence
the
sound
of
the
voice
dwindled
to
a
drone
like
the
singing
of
insects
i
swayed
forward
dizzy
and
pallid
to
be
boiled
alive
i
forgot
yuki
but
i
remembered
the
revolver
in
my
bosom
a
cold
fury
of
despair
seized
upon
me
i
would
end
all
now
while
i
had
the
chance
first
to
send
to
hell
that
chief
counsellor
my
hand
stole
in
between
the
folds
of
my
robe
not
a
moment
too
soon
to
stop
me
i
heard
piercing
whisper
not
now
not
now
the
magistrates
were
rising
to
leave
the
hall
of
audience
but
midzuano
remained
seated
i
paused
with
my
hand
gripped
on
the
butt
of
my
revolver
they
were
minor
officials
mere
tools
in
the
hands
of
our
enemies
the
man
who
had
dictated
their
actions
still
lingered
i
could
wait
midzuano
drew
from
his
sleeve
a
written
scroll
and
a
seal
and
called
for
a
brush
and
ink
one
of
the
secretaries
who
had
remained
brought
a
tray
of
inks
and
brushes
midzuano
took
up
a
brush
dipped
it
in
a
saucer
of
freshly
ground
ink
and
unrolled
the
scroll
satsuma
turned
his
powerful
face
squarely
about
to
the
chief
counsellor
midzuano
in
such
haste
to
issue
the
warrant
of
the
council
of
elders
confirming
the
sentence
against
the
prisoners
he
demanded
great
zeal
can
not
be
shown
in
ridding
the
land
of
spies
and
traitors
replied
midzuano
and
he
filled
in
a
blank
space
in
the
warrant
with
swift
strokes
of
his
brush
word
of
counsel
to
the
counsellor
interposed
yoritomo
two
of
the
guards
sprang
before
him
midzuano
waved
them
aside
he
did
not
lack
courage
and
courtesy
condemned
men
are
free
to
speak
he
said
knows
that
two
of
the
charges
against
the
prisoner
are
false
said
yoritomo
sama
is
not
a
spy
and
no
more
a
member
of
the
evil
sect
than
are
the
dutch
at
nagasaki
who
have
not
been
required
to
tread
upon
the
cross
for
a
long
period
regarding
the
third
charge
the
act
confessed
though
against
the
letter
of
the
law
was
committed
to
save
the
daughter
from
the
shame
of
captivity
the
warships
of
the
august
ruler
will
soon
appear
off
the
coast
of
nippon
advice
is
given
that
the
prisoner
be
honorably
delivered
over
to
the
exalted
commander
of
the
american
fleet
is
far
from
yedo
the
hairy
barbarians
will
hear
nothing
regarding
their
countryman
replied
midzuano
and
he
signed
the
warrant
counsellor
is
wise
i
jeered
is
well
advised
to
stop
the
mouths
of
those
who
might
tell
of
his
share
in
the
plot
against
the
midzuano
looked
down
the
room
at
me
with
his
stare
for
a
full
false
move
brother
whispered
yoritomo
no
more
midzuano
picked
up
the
seal
as
he
stamped
it
in
the
ink
the
floor
quivered
as
if
before
the
precursor
of
an
earthquake
an
instant
later
the
air
resounded
with
the
clangorous
boom
of
a
mighty
bell
it
was
the
alarm
note
of
the
great
bell
at
the
temple
of
zozoji
midzuano
paused
with
the
seal
suspended
above
our
death
warrant
there
was
a
scurry
in
the
anteroom
and
a
voice
cried
shrilly
barbarians
the
barbarians
have
come
woe
to
nippon
the
black
ships
enter
yedo
bay
other
bells
were
joining
the
clamor
of
their
harsher
notes
to
the
sonorous
thunder
from
zozoji
without
a
trace
of
hesitancy
or
emotion
midzuano
brought
the
suspended
seal
down
upon
the
warrant
the
man
was
bred
he
straightened
and
beckoned
to
the
captain
of
the
guard
perry
had
come
and
in
the
same
hour
this
counsellor
would
drag
us
out
to
shameful
execution
i
began
to
draw
my
revolver
brother
not
yet
entreated
yoritomo
above
the
thunderous
tocsin
of
the
alarm
bells
the
captain
knelt
to
receive
the
warrant
i
glanced
about
to
assure
myself
that
the
guard
was
not
approaching
to
seize
us
once
in
their
grip
only
yuki
would
stand
between
me
and
a
hideous
death
the
risk
of
his
failure
was
too
great
i
could
now
be
certain
of
myself
and
of
midzuano
as
well
a
was
approaching
us
from
the
rear
i
half
drew
my
revolver
a
second
glance
showed
me
that
the
man
was
not
one
of
the
guard
but
gengo
the
new
court
chamberlain
he
walked
arrogantly
up
the
chamber
to
the
place
of
highest
honor
before
the
raised
a
scroll
to
his
forehead
and
kowtowed
with
his
back
to
all
in
the
room
beams
and
floors
were
shaking
and
screens
rattling
in
their
slots
with
the
boom
of
temple
bells
and
the
wild
clang
of
firebells
in
every
quarter
of
yedo
the
alarm
was
sweeping
over
the
city
like
a
tidal
wave
yet
not
a
man
about
us
stirred
every
eye
was
fixed
upon
the
messenger
of
the
shogun
gengo
rose
faced
about
and
displayed
the
great
vermilion
seal
of
his
master
upon
the

in
the

from
the
humblest
among
the
attendants
to
the
of

before
the

gengo
swelled
with
pride
heed
to
the
command
of
his

above

the
draught
was
a
bitter
one
for

kami
he
thrust
the
death
warrant
into
his
bosom
bowed
punctiliously
to
gengo
and
satsuma
and
rose
to
depart
with
the
excuse
that
he
must
call
a

of
the
council

to
consider
the
threatened

barbarians
gengo
the
chamberlain
withdrew
immediately
afterwards
too
puffed
with
importance
to
acknowledge
the
nod
of
satsuma
with
the
disappearance
of
the
messenger
the
alarm
and
confusion
outside
the
audience
chamber
seized
upon
the
about
us
giving
way
to
the
terror
which
drove
in
upon
them
with
the
din
of
the
bells
and
wild
cries
from
all
parts
of
the
the
guardsmen
flung
open
the
screens
and
rushed
out
in
a
panic
of
fear
the
daimio
rose
with
stately
composure
and
signed
us
to
follow
him
we
went
out
escorted
only
by
our
satsuma
swordbearers
and
the
official
who
as
bearer
of
the
sword
had
been
restrained
by
his
duty
from
joining
the
flight
of
his
the
harsh
clang
of
the
firebells
had
now
ceased
and
the
boom
of
the
temple
bells
reverberated
at
less
frequent
intervals
but
the
funereal
solemnity
of
the
tolling
served
only
to
intensify
to
highest
pitch
the
panic
effect
of
the
first
wild
tocsin
to
the
terrified
japanese
it
was
the
knell
of
doom
for
yedo
excited
ran
about
at
random
through
the
rooms
and
corridors
of
the
their
faces
distorted
with
fury
and
despair
while
from
the
quarters
shrill
voices
pierced
the
frail
walls
of
the
palace
with
shrieks
of
terror
with
fear
run
riot
in
the
of
the
high
court
what
must
be
the
panic
beyond
the
moats
of
the
official
quarter
among
the
million
denizens
of
the
lower
city
in
the
midst
of
the
wild
flurry
a
scowling
rushed
at
me
with
furious
imprecations
but
as
his
blade
flashed
out
yoritomo
flung
me
headlong
away
from
the
stroke
and
my
satsuma
swordbearer
rushed
to
my
defence
my
assailant
barely
saved
his
head
by
a
dexterous
parry
before
he
could
strike
in
turn
the
swordbearer
called
out
a
sharp
command
at
the
voice
of
his
superior
officer
the
assassin
leaped
back
and
sheathed
his
sword
my
defender
looked
to
his
lord
satsuma
frowned
at
the
and
said
sternly
great
an
insult
can
not
be
endured
even
in
the
of
the
high
i
cried
springing
up
between
the
man
and
the
blade
that
circled
to
cut
him
down
the
satsuma
man
checked
his
stroke
in
your
sword
i
commanded
attacked
me
because
of
mistaken
loyalty
let
the
of
nippon
learn
that
my
countrymen
come
in
peace
and
friendship
not
to
kill
or
the
dropped
on
his
knees
and
kowtowed
to
me
but
satsuma
shook
his
head
doubtfully
and
signed
to
the
swordbearers
will
prepare
against
other
efforts
of
mistaken
the
bearers
handed
over
our
swords
and
we
passed
on
out
to
the
portico
the
courtyard
was
crowded
with
shouting
but
the
satsuma
men
of
our
cortege
stood
as
we
had
left
them
too
sternly
intent
upon
their
duty
to
give
way
to
the
general
fear
and
flurry
at
a
word
from
the
daimio
the
nets
that
had
been
used
on
the
of
yoritomo
and
myself
were
flung
aside
we
seated
ourselves
and
the
procession
left
the
with
all
its
usual
stateliness
of
parade
though
at
a
quickened
pace
a
few
yards
beyond
the
gateway
yuki
was
kneeling
at
the
edge
of
the
to
watch
us
pass
i
saw
him
lean
forward
and
stare
at
our
then
relax
and
sit
back
on
his
heels
he
had
perceived
from
the
strain
upon
our
bearers
that
our
were
occupied
turning
a
corner
some
distance
beyond
i
looked
back
and
saw
the
walking
after
the
rear
of
the
procession
with
a
woman
close
behind
him
the
streets
of
the
official
quarter
swarmed
with
and
the
of
various
rushing
about
afoot
or
mounted
some
without
aim
or
purpose
others
racing
with
all
possible
speed
and
directness
to
fulfil
the
commands
of
their
lords
in
the
midst
of
the
turmoil
a
captain
of
the
palace
guard
galloped
up
to
the
procession
with
an
order
for
satsuma
to
wait
upon
the
shogun
the
daimio
immediately
detached
a
number
of
his
retainers
to
escort
us
to
owari
yashiki
and
ordered
the
cortege
back
to
the
sakaruda
gate
which
had
just
been
passed
the
sun
was
setting
as
we
advanced
again
along
the
great
causeway
skirting
the
scarp
of
the
citadel
moat
this
time
however
my
attention
was
directed
not
towards
the
moat
and
the
mighty
rampart
on
the
far
side
but
to
my
left
whence
sounded
the
wild
din
and
turmoil
of
a
city
in
panic
we
swung
up
a
slope
from
the
crest
far
away
to
the
i
caught
sight
of
grand
cone
rising
in
purple
majesty
through
the
twilight
while
to
the
southward
the
dark
sky
was
streaked
with
upshooting
red
and
blue
meteors
the
signal
rockets
sent
up
from
every
headland
along
the
bay
shores
not
yedo
alone
was
in
vain
i
strained
my
eyes
to
discern
the
glimmer
of
ship
lights
on
the
vast
stretch
of
the
gulf
but
it
was
easy
to
imagine
the
majestic
sight
of
the
great
steam
frigates
and
lying
at
anchor
with
their
consorts
in
the
lower
bay
i
pictured
the
tiers
of
gunports
triced
open
for
action
and
the
grim
guns
lurking
within
charged
and
shotted
against
treacherous
attack
for
a
moment
i
felt
a
pang
of
longing
of
but
only
for
a
moment
i
had
cast
in
my
lot
with
yoritomo
a
horseman
dashed
up
the
slope
after
us
and
drew
rein
beside
our
party
with
a
loud
command
to
halt
the
satsuma
men
came
to
a
sudden
stand
i
peered
out
and
saw
that
the
rider
was
gengo
the
court
chamberlain
he
caught
sight
of
me
between
the
parted
curtains
and
bowed
low
across
the
barbed
mane
of
his
horse
presence
of
woroto
sama
is
required
at
the
palace
he
called
at
a
word
from
me
my
bearers
ranged
up
alongside
the
other
until
i
was
within
of
my
face
heard
tomo
i
said
in
english
does
it
mean
he
fixed
a
keen
gaze
upon
gengo
and
demanded
the
command
include
both
woroto
sama
and
myself
gengo
bowed
low
as
he
replied
honored
heir
of
owari
is
still
in
mourning
the
presence
of
woroto
sama
is
alone
once
sama
should
mount
his
bear
a
written
order
matter
is
urgent
time
was
lacking
to
write
an
yoritomo
met
my
expectant
look
with
an
anxious
frown
is
hard
to
tell
brother
he
answered
me
in
english
he
brought
a
written
command
yet
in
all
this
wild
alarm
even
the
castle
must
be
in
a
turmoil
they
may
want
your
assurance
that
the
commodore
comes
in
risk
to
tell
them
that
i
cried
and
i
called
to
my
escort
fetch
sandals
and
my
in
the
confusion
of
my
quick
scramble
out
of
the
and
into
the
saddle
some
one
pressed
a
little
square
of
paper
into
my
hand
as
i
set
my
feet
deep
in
the
huge
stirrups
i
looked
about
and
saw
yuki
slipping
out
from
among
the
satsuma
men
gengo
was
wheeling
around
the
other
way
my
fiery
little
stallion
plunged
free
from
his
grooms
and
to
gain
a
better
grip
of
the
bridle
i
thrust
note
into
my
bosom
a
moment
later
and
i
was
racing
madly
back
along
the
causeway
with
gengo
a
length
in
the
lead
yelling
for
all
to
clear
the
road
after
me
ran
the
satsuma
grooms
who
had
charge
of
my
horse
down
the
slope
we
tore
at
breakneck
speed
through
the
midst
of
the
swarming
nimbly
as
they
leaped
aside
at
commands
we
must
inevitably
have
run
over
more
than
one
had
the
roadway
been
less
broad
or
the
distance
greater
a
scant
minute
brought
us
to
the
bridge
of
the
sakaruda
gate
a
procession
was
coming
down
to
the
bridge
from
the
east
regardless
of
its
standards
we
cut
in
ahead
and
galloped
across
the
bridge
at
the
gateway
gengo
leaped
off
and
ran
forward
to
speak
with
the
gate
warden
the
latter
entered
into
a
dispute
which
though
soon
settled
by
gengo
gave
my
grooms
time
to
come
panting
across
the
bridge
after
us
gengo
hastened
back
to
me
and
cried
out
with
imperative
urgency
sama
can
not
pass
unless
on
foot
yet
haste
is
required
i
thought
it
no
time
for
insistence
upon
dignity
carried
away
by
the
possibility
of
persuading
the
shogun
to
receive
my
countrymen
with
cordiality
i
sprang
off
as
the
satsuma
men
grasped
my
bridle
on
i
cried
he
signed
to
the
satsuma
men
to
return
with
the
stallion
your
a
will
be
provided
for
the
lord
he
explained
and
as
the
grooms
hastened
away
he
led
his
own
horse
forward
to
place
him
in
the
charge
of
a
palace
groom
the
thought
flashed
upon
me
that
in
the
heat
and
excitement
of
the
panic
the
sight
of
my
eyes
might
cause
the
blades
of
other
assassins
to
leap
from
their
scabbards
or
at
best
cause
serious
delays
in
our
advance
i
squinted
my
eyes
and
followed
gengo
with
my
chin
on
my
breast
though
the
gate
watch
had
been
doubled
neither
my
height
nor
the
whiteness
of
my
forehead
was
noticed
by
the
crowd
of
chattering
through
which
we
forced
our
way
under
the
great
gateway
across
the
court
and
below
the
inner
gateway
on
the
right
as
we
issued
into
a
broad
plaza
within
gengo
turned
on
his
heel
for
a
moment
i
fancied
i
saw
chagrin
and
bitter
disappointment
in
his
narrow
eyes
but
then
his
face
shone
with
the
blandest
of
smiles
and
i
told
myself
i
had
been
deceived
by
the
gathering
twilight
sama
is
wise
to
walk
humbly
he
whispered
him
continue
so
and
he
will
be
conducted
safely
past
all
i
followed
the
gesture
that
took
in
the
hundreds
of
palace
retainers
before
us
and
replied
he
turned
again
and
walked
swiftly
along
the
edge
of
an
inner
moat
of
the
citadel
i
followed
through
the
midst
of
the
guards
and
other
palace
attendants
still
unchallenged
and
unheeded
presently
gengo
led
me
across
a
bridge
to
a
gateway
whose
guards
seemed
to
have
deserted
their
post
after
pausing
to
peer
about
in
an
odd
manner
my
guide
hurried
me
through
the
gateway
with
feverish
haste
i
found
myself
in
one
of
the
palace
gardens
we
advanced
quickly
along
a
narrow
path
between
coppices
tenanted
only
by
birds
and
our
course
was
so
full
of
irregular
twists
and
turns
that
i
soon
lost
our
bearings
after
a
few
minutes
we
came
to
a
small
kiosk
or
in
the
midst
of
a
grove
of
gnarled
old
cherry
trees
it
was
the
first
building
i
had
seen
in
the
garden
though
more
than
once
i
had
heard
voices
which
led
me
to
believe
that
we
had
passed
other
houses
gengo
stopped
at
the
edge
of
the
kiosk
veranda
and
kowtowed
sama
will
be
pleased
to
wait
here
he
said
before
i
could
reply
he
hurried
on
along
the
path
within
the
toss
of
a
biscuit
he
turned
a
bend
and
disappeared
i
seated
myself
on
the
edge
of
the
veranda
and
waited
about
me
was
the
peaceful
hush
of
the
woods
with
its
twittering
birds
the
turmoil
of
the
terrified
city
barely
reached
me
over
the
treetops
but
my
mood
jarred
with
this
sylvan
quietude
i
was
burning
with
impatience
to
reach
the
shogun
and
protest
the
absurdity
of
the
wild
panic
that
had
seized
upon
his
people
i
sprang
up
and
paced
half
way
to
the
next
turn
and
back
again
observing
with
surprise
that
objects
were
still
distinctly
visible
even
in
the
shadow
of
the
coppice
we
had
come
so
quickly
from
where
i
had
parted
with
yoritomo
that
a
full
of
twilight
yet
remained
gengo
could
not
miss
his
way
for
lack
of
light
again
i
paced
towards
the
turn
and
back
as
i
rounded
the
kiosk
i
glanced
down
the
path
by
which
we
had
come
at
the
last
bend
stood
an
armored
with
drawn
sword
my
first
thought
was
that
the
man
must
be
a
foreguard
of
the
shogun
i
waved
my
hand
to
him
in
the
same
instant
he
whirled
up
his
sword
and
called
fiercely
the
at
the
kiosk
upon
him
the
barbarian
kill
kill
yelled
voices
behind
him
and
as
the
leader
rushed
towards
me
other
swordsmen
charged
around
the
bend
after
him
half
a
score
or
more
in
the
first
bunch
between
revolver
and
sword
i
might
possibly
have
checked
and
stood
off
that
number
but
still
others
yelled
in
the
path
behind
them
and
there
was
utmost
need
to
avoid
a
clash
with
the
retainers
i
turned
and
ran
up
the
path
hoping
to
overtake
gengo
the
redoubled
their
yells
and
dashed
after
me
i
twisted
around
the
turn
and
saw
before
me
less
than
a
hundred
yards
away
a
number
of
lancemen
charging
to
cut
off
my
retreat
the
silent
stealth
of
this
rear
attack
was
more
appalling
than
the
open
charge
of
the
other
party
had
these
lancemen
come
a
few
seconds
sooner
i
would
have
been
taken
by
surprise
and
pierced
by
their
long
shafts
without
warning
even
as
it
was
i
had
no
time
for
second
thought
at
the
of
the
lancemen
i
leaped
the
hedge
of
clipped
privet
on
my
right
and
plunged
straight
into
the
coppice
beyond
fortunately
my
sandals
were
bound
on
firmly
and
the
coppice
while
dense
enough
to
screen
me
after
a
dozen
yards
was
of
willowy
shrubs
that
did
not
catch
my
loose
garments
or
bar
my
advance
a
louder
outburst
of
yells
told
me
that
the
two
parties
of
pursuers
had
met
and
from
the
crashing
that
followed
i
knew
that
they
were
beating
through
the
coppice
after
me
in
quickly
scattering
formation
had
i
doubled
they
would
have
run
me
down
in
the
first
minute
i
kept
straight
on
trusting
to
the
gathering
gloom
to
hide
the
traces
of
my
flight
and
to
the
noise
of
the
pursuit
to
drown
the
thud
of
my
sandals
on
the
turf
had
the
coppice
continued
i
might
have
gained
enough
to
slip
around
one
of
their
flanks
and
make
my
way
back
by
the
path
out
of
the
enclosure
but
within
fifty
yards
i
burst
out
of
the
thicket
into
an
open
garden
that
lay
about
a
large
lotus
pond
upon
an
island
in
the
centre
of
the
pond
stood
a
kiosk
approached
from
the
left
end
of
the
pond
over
a
narrow
bridge
of
bamboo
beyond
towering
high
among
the
treetops
rose
the
white
of
a
large
edifice
beneath
that
crest
there
was
a
possibility
that
i
might
find
a
palace
official
able
and
willing
to
check
my
pursuers
and
conduct
me
to
the
shogun
without
a
pause
i
dashed
across
the
garden
veering
to
pass
around
the
left
end
of
the
pond
my
pursuers
were
closer
upon
me
than
i
had
thought
the
leaders
who
had
been
running
silently
through
the
coppice
burst
out
almost
on
my
heels
the
exultant
note
of
their
sent
me
clumping
down
towards
the
shore
of
the
pond
at
redoubled
speed
illustration
this
loyal
service
she
asked
for
a
while
i
gained
rapidly
on
the
the
mass
of
whom
broke
cover
soon
after
their
leaders
their
exultant
cries
changed
to
furious
imprecations
as
they
perceived
that
i
was
outrunning
them
but
as
i
plunged
down
to
the
pond
bank
a
little
short
of
the
bridge
i
was
dismayed
to
find
that
one
of
the
thongs
of
my
right
sandal
had
burst
a
few
steps
more
would
find
the
sandal
loose
i
could
not
stop
to
refasten
it
nor
was
there
time
to
slash
the
thongs
of
both
sandals
and
run
on
in
stockinged
feet
the
high
arch
of
the
bridge
caught
my
despairing
glance
i
swung
around
the
and
clattered
up
the
sharp
ascent
to
the
round
of
the
arch
the
bridge
was
very
narrow
they
could
approach
me
no
more
than
two
abreast
i
would
pick
them
off
at
the
foot
so
long
as
my
cartridges
lasted
and
then
do
what
i
might
with
my
sword
to
sell
my
life
dearly
as
i
gained
the
top
of
the
bridge
i
saw
a
woman
dart
from
the
far
end
into
the
kiosk
but
the
foremost
of
my
pursuers
were
already
at
the
pond
bank
and
i
whirled
about
with
drawn
revolver
to
face
them
for
all
their
fierce
eagerness
the
sight
of
the
threatening
muzzle
brought
them
to
a
halt
they
had
heard
of
the
defeat
of
the
the
leaders
checked
those
who
followed
and
all
gathered
at
the
foot
of
the
bridge
yelling
imprecations
at
the
i
shouted
foot
on
this
bridge
and
you
die
your
master
the
shogun
sent
for
me
he
waits
for
me
now
go
fetch
gengo
the
fetch
bowmen
instead
cried
one
of
the
leaders
of
the
mob
and
musketeers
cried
another
with
the
bridge
yelled
a
third
leader
the
response
was
instant
a
dozen
men
caught
up
the
cry
and
sprang
into
the
pond
to
hack
at
the
frail
supports
of
the
bridge
with
their
swords
i
sighted
my
revolver
at
the
foremost
but
before
i
could
fire
several
pointed
up
and
cried
to
their
fellows
hold
a
moment
later
all
were
kneeling
even
those
in
the
shallow
water
of
the
pond
something
brushed
softly
against
my
sleeve
i
turned
half
about
beside
me
stood
the
princess
azai
her
hands
were
folded
within
the
long
sleeves
of
her
scarlet
and
she
was
gazing
down
upon
the
mob
as
tranquilly
as
if
contemplating
the
irises
in
the
pool
when
she
spoke
her
voice
was
barely
audible
above
the
labored
breathing
of
the
this
loyal
service
she
asked
explanation
be
made
why
you
seek
to
murder
the
honored
friend
of
your
august

one
of

those
in

the
princess
turned
slowly
about
to
face
me
with
no
change
in
the
quiet
composure
of
her
bearing
but
as
her
soft
eyes
met
mine
their
long
lashes
drooped
and
the
delicate
rose
tint
of
her
cheeks
deepened
to
scarlet
she
sank
to
her
knees
and
bowed
with
exquisite
grace
august

is
implored
to
pardon
the
rudeness
of
the
she
murmured
implores
pardon
for
intruding
upon

i
replied
she
bent

me
to

stepped
back
hastily
and
knelt
on

knee
to
tie
the
thong

not
be

i
said
my
land
it
is
etiquette
for
lords
to
fasten
the
sandals
of
ladies
not
the
contrary
to
all
reason
and
propriety
she
exclaimed
and
she
gazed
up
at
me
with
a
look
of
timid
wonderment
i
rose
and
offered
her
my
hand
momentarily
forgetful
of
etiquette
she
sprang
up
with
a
repellent
gesture
and
a
sharp
little
cry
setsu
sought
to
touch
my
august
lady
hissed
a
voice
behind
me
i
wheeled
and
confronted
the
younger
of
women
standing
very
near
me
with
her
hand
on
the
hilt
of
her
dirk
i
looked
steadily
into
her
angry
eyes
and
smiled
at
her
through
the
gloom
setsu
san
will
believe
that
no
rudeness
was
intended
by
the
ignorant
i
said
his
land
courtesy
requires
a
lord
to
offer
his
hand
and
assist
a
lady
to

bowed
to
hide
her
amazement
and

me
into
this

and
left
me
at

yonder
i
explained
pointing
towards
the
coppice
understanding
was
that
he
went
to
fetch
the
shogun
or
some
high
official
hardly
had
he
gone
when
the
appeared
and
charged
upon
me

i
suspect
by
the

who
set

with
subtle
intuition
and
others
but
i
intrude
upon
the
privacy
of
the

tell
me
which
way
i
should
go
to
leave
the

orders
to
bring
you
into
the
presence
of
my
august
father
inquired
azai
stated
that
my
presence
was
required
at
the

was
i
wrong
in
believing
that

gasped
setsu
in
open
dismay
for
the
daughter
of
the
shogun
to
have
come
between
the
angry
and
the
is
unbelievable
setsu
san
will
be
so
kind
as
to
bring
my
clogs
murmured
the
princess
with
gentle
courtesy
for
the
first
time
i
noticed
that
the
little
foot
peeping
from
under
the
edge
of
her
was
without
clog
or
sandal
when
setsu
ran
in
to
tell
of
the
chase
of
the
her
mistress
had
darted
out
and
up
the
bridge
to
my
rescue
without
stopping
for
footwear
i
said
setsu
san
is
right
i
can
not
accept
the
lord
will
not
refuse
me
the
favor
she
murmured
with
a
smile
irresistibly
sweet
and
naive
kind
o
setsu
san
hastens
to
fetch
my
perceiving
the
inflexible
will
beneath
the
soft
accents
of
her
mistress
the
lady
turned
to
patter
down
the
bridge
i
was
alone
with
the
princess
probably
the
first
man
to
be
alone
with
an
unwedded
daughter
of
the
shogun
for
more
than
two
centuries
i
dropped
on
one
knee
to
look
into
her
modestly
lowered
eyes
through
the
gathering
darkness
i
saw
a
deep
blush
mantle
her
pale
cheeks
as
with
girlish
bashfulness
she
raised
one
of
her
sleeves
to
hide
her
face
i
murmured
the
so
frightful
an
object
to
you
she
dropped
her
sleeve
and
gazed
at
me
in
instant
forgetfulness
of
self
the
rudeness
she
exclaimed
august
lord
should
not
humble
himself
by
kneeling
to
a
girl
forgive
me
for
the
great
rudeness
but
in
my
country
men
love
and
honor
pure
maidens
as
they
love
and
honor
their
mothers
and
it
is
the
custom
to
speak
of
that
love
even
before
marriage
little
princess
i
have
been
told
that
your
august
father
and
the
prince
of
owari
arranged
for
you
to
wed
my
friend
yoritomo
sama
but
my
friend
has
vowed
to
become
a
monk
at
zozoji
and
he
has
told
me
that
my
soul
shone
in
your
eyes
azai
i
love
you
with
a
love
higher
and
deeper
than
any
man
of
nippon
bears
towards
his
wife
and
mother
she
knelt
and
bowed
low
to
me
lord
she
whispered
is
unbelievable
that
so
great
a
love
could
be
given
a
mere
girl
soul
is
in
my
eyes
azai
say
that
you
love
me
lord
i
should
rejoice
to
be
accepted
as
the
humblest
in
all
your
love
me
i
cried
and
drawing
her
up
by
one
of
her
tiny
plump
hands
i
bent
close
my
land
august
lady
it
is
required
to
seal
the
confession
of
love
in
this
at
the
touch
of
my
lips
to
her
rosebud
mouth
she
drew
back
with
a
startled
sob
but
i
resisted
her
gentle
efforts
to
withdraw
her
hand
you
not
trust
me
azai
i
asked
bending
to
watch
her
downcast
face
in
the
dim
light
has
overcome
me
she
sobbed
is
it
written
that
man
and
woman
should
hold
one
hands
or
touch
lips
that
is
hateful
to
the
princess
hateful
but
blissful
blissful
beyond
words
that
is
the
shame
i
do
what
is
very
very
wrong
yet
am
glad
i
am
a
most
wicked
and
depraved
girl
shame
overcomes
me
me
azai
through
my
selfish
fault
i
have
brought
grief
upon
the
maiden
whom
i
love
more
than
life
i
will
go
now
and
never
trouble
you
i
freed
her
hand
and
rose
but
in
the
same
instant
she
was
erect
before
me
her
little
hands
clutching
the
bosom
of
my
robes
thou
she
whispered
not
go
in
anger
else
i
shall
die
i
crushed
her
to
me
and
rained
kisses
upon
her
upturned
face
in
a
passion
of
adoration
for
a
few
brief
moments
of
ecstasy
i
held
her
and
she
made
no
attempt
to
free
herself
but
lay
upon
my
breast
like
a
captive
dove
quivering
and
bewildered
then
all
too
soon
for
my
blissful
intoxication
her
cheeks
paled
from
scarlet
to
ivory
white
and
her
fluttering
little
heart
beat
against
mine
with
sudden
steadiness
lord
she
said
is
no
time
to
be
lost
setsu
comes
with
a
lantern
we
must
act
at
once
here
below
the
centre
of
the
bridge
the
pond
is
deeper
we
will
leap
in
together
and
grasp
the
lotus
roots
at
the
off
grasp
the
lotus
roots
i
repeated
lord
lover
is
of
noble
blood
a
thousand
pardons
but
setsu
comes
quickly
make
haste
to
strike
me
through
the
neck
with
your
dirk
you
will
still
have
time
to
commit
the
word
was
a
flash
of
clear
light
through
the
fog
of
my
bewilderment
i
cried
will
live
to
be
united
in
this
life
can
not
be
my
lord
will
win
and
wed
you
in
the
teeth
of
all
nippon
lord
i
her
whisper
thrilled
with
quick
alarm
me
setsu
kill
you
disgrace
a
dirk
i
released
her
and
turned
to
the
upward
hastening
setsu
as
the
light
of
her
paper
lantern
glowed
upon
us
through
the
darkness
august
ones
she
called
charcoal
had
burnt
out
and
the
tinder
was
misplaced
i
could
come
no
have
done
well
to
come
so
soon
murmured
azai
o
setsu
raised
her
lantern
and
peered
at
me
under
it
as
she
bowed
her
utter
devotion
to
the
princess
could
not
be
doubted
i
felt
a
sudden
impulse
to
risk
all
in
her
keeping
o
setsu
san
desire
the
death
of
her
princess
i
asked
the
girl
grasped
at
her
dirk
and
cast
a
swift
glance
from
me
to
azai
the
threaten
she
demanded
you
do
that
i
replied
me
and
your
dirk
will
pierce
through
my
heart
to
the
girl
stepped
nearer
to
her
mistress
and
stared
at
her
dismayed
truth
is
now
known
to
you
whispered
azai
again
setsu
grasped
her
dirk
an
evil
would
dare
speak
of
such
a
matter
to
the
daughter
death
was
nearer
to
me
than
when
the
struck
at
me
in
the
of
the
high
court
my
heart
to
her
heart
i
repeated
the
girl
glanced
doubtfully
to
azai
i
forced
a
smile
princess
has
proposed
that
she
and
i
should
unite
ourselves
by
passing
through
the
gate
of
death
i
have
answered
that
i
will
wed
her
in
this
is
unwilling
to
give
proof
as
to
the
trueness
of
his
love
she
jeered
to
this
there
was
only
one
answer
that
could
convince
her
i
knelt
and
placed
the
point
of
my
dirk
to
my
heart
belief
is
that
sincerity
comes
from
the
heart
i
said
the
word
and
i
will
prove
my
love
without
asking
the
maiden
to
sacrifice
herself
to
join
me
i
trust
her
soul
to
find
mine
when
the
time
comes
for
her
to
leave
this
there
was
no
pretence
in
my
words
i
had
lived
too
close
to
yoritomo
to
escape
the
influence
of
his
buddhistic
philosophy
and
his
contempt
for
death
my
love
for
my
little
madonna
princess
was
greater
than
my
love
of
life
and
i
knew
that
only
a
love
equal
to
my
own
could
have
enabled
her
to
overcome
the
extreme
modesty
and
reserve
of
her
breeding
i
believed
that
death
would
unite
us
in
the
next
life
if
not
in
many
future
lives
while
if
setsu
opposed
me
i
could
not
hope
to
win
my
darling
in
this
life
the
word
girl
i
repeated
wait
my
lord
cried
azai
and
she
knelt
beside
me
free
me
that
i
may
go
with
will
follow
when
your
time
comes
i
said
may
kill
the
woman
he
loves
only
to
save
her
from
a
fate
worse
than
without
you
my
lord
what
harsher
fate
a
steel
blade
flashed
in
her
upraising
hand
i
caught
her
wrist
as
she
drew
back
and
stabbed
the
point
at
her
throat
her
away
setsu
i
begged
must
live
and
be
happy
she
is
very
men
of
nippon
do
not
love
as
my
lord
loves
murmured
the
girl
will
go
before
with
the
light
let
him
follow
at
a
little
distance
the
darkness
deepens
he
will
not
be
seen
until
we
come
to
the
azai
rose
and
slipped
on
the
tiny
high
clogs
of
gold
lacquer
that
were
held
for
her
by
the
kneeling
girl
she
bowed
to
me
from
the
miniature
height
with
entrancing
grace
beg
my
lord
to
rise
and
sheathe
his
dirk
until
it
is
needed
we
now
go
to
my
she
turned
and
pattered
quickly
down
the
bridge
to
the
pond
bank
while
setsu
following
half
a
step
behind
held
the
lantern
in
such
a
manner
as
to
shed
no
light
to
the
rear
i
slipped
my
dirk
into
its
sheath
and
descended
after
them
my
thoughts
in
a
whirl
of
conflicting
emotions
from
the
edge
of
the
pond
the
little
princess
led
the
way
through
a
shrubbery
along
a
winding
path
towards
the
edifice
i
had
seen
in
my
flight
before
the
we
soon
came
in
sight
of
the
lanterns
strung
along
the
deep
verandas
of
the
building
but
azai
turned
off
to
the
right
and
tripped
away
down
a
side
path
that
skirted
around
her
palace
a
short
walk
brought
us
into
a
broad
avenue
that
ran
up
to
a
high
bridge
across
one
of
the
inner
moats
of
the
citadel
setsu
hastened
on
towards
the
gateway
of
the
bridge
azai
paused
for
me
to
overtake
her
in
the
garden
path
there
had
been
no
one
to
meet
or
pass
now
however
there
rose
the
question
of
facing
the
guard
at
the
gate
when
i
came
up
close
beside
the
princess
i
perceived
the
outline
of
her
little
hands
before
her
bosom
clasped
palm
to
palm
in
prayer
stop
here
my
lord
she
whispered
goes
ahead
to
see
who
is
on
i
replied
you
to
appear
with
me
is
too
great
a
sacrifice
of
your
dignity
press
your
lips
to
mine
and
say
farewell
i
will
go
on
she
caught
at
my
sleeve
my
lord
i
will
go
with
you
there
is
only
this
little
time
left
us
when
my
father
learns
i
fear
he
will
forbid
me
even
to
dream
of
you
they
have
told
me
that
i
shall
be
required
to
wed
keiki
if
counsel
would
not
wed
the
man
who
set
the
upon
you
good
daughter
should
obey
with
docility
when
her
father
chooses
her
husband
yet
i
have
never
before
heard
of
a
lady
meeting
a
lord
and
loving
before
marriage
as
i
love
my
lord
maiden
i
exclaimed
again
confess
that
you
love
me
how
can
you
speak
of
wedding
another
lord
wonders
yet
he
knows
that
the
supreme
duty
of
a
woman
is
willing
obedience
first
to
her
father
then
to
her
husband
and
last
of
all
to
her
eldest
son
i
know
that
my
august
father
holds
me
in
higher
regard
than
is
deserved
by
so
worthless
and
contemptible
a
creature
as
a
young
girl
and
because
of
his
gracious
condescension
i
owe
him
the
utmost
of
gratitude
and
will
wed
keiki
if
your
father
commands
i
asked
her
voice
quavered
pray
to
kwannon
to
aid
me
if
so
great
a
trial
comes
upon
me
i
fear
i
must
fail
in
the
one
great
virtue
i
must
oppose
the
will
of
my
father
will
refuse
keiki
and
wait
for
me
azai
will
wait
for
you
in
the

beyond
that

in
dismay
that

in

if

i
will
not
seek
to
half
a
minute
later
she
sought
to
release
my
embrace
with
her
gentle
fingers

she
whispered
tremulously
never
knew
that
it
was
so
delightful
to
love
it
is
very
wicked
to
speak
so
foolishly
yet

that

jarring
counsellors
setsu
met
us
midway
but
turned
again
the
moment
the
glow
of
her
lantern
fell
upon
her
advancing
mistress
azai
joined
her
while
i
fell
back
into
the
darkness
when
the
maidens
came
within
the
narrow
circle
of
light
shed
by
the
gateway
lanterns
setsu
signed
me
to
stop
they
went
on
a
few
steps
and
entered
the
gate
lodge
after
a
short
wait
setsu
reappeared
and
beckoned
to
me
as
i
advanced
she
stepped
back
through
an
opening
in
the
wooden
night
shutters
of
the
veranda
i
hastened
forward
but
paused
at
the
edge
of
the
veranda
hesitating
whether
i
should
loosen
my
sandals
across
from
me
the
shadows
of
a
man
and
a
woman
were
silhouetted
on
the
white
paper
of
the
wall
screens
by
the
lamplight
the
shadow
of
the
woman
bowed
and
glided
off
to
the
right
the
shadow
moved
a
little
to
the
left
and
the
screen
on
which
it
was
cast
slid
aside
before
me
stood
a
in
helmet
and
cuirass
half
unconscious
of
the
act
i
put
my
hand
on
my
swordhilt
the
kowtowed
has
been
given
that
my
lord
is
to
be
conducted
into
the
presence
of
the
shogun
he
murmured
i
signed
him
to
rise
he
slipped
back
into
the
lodge
and
came
out
again
to
kneel
and
offer
me
a
hat
of
plaited
rattan
i
set
it
on
my
head
while
he
stepped
into
a
pair
of
clogs
and
turned
to
lead
me
out
through
the
gateway
i
looked
for
a
last
vision
of
my
little
princess
but
she
failed
to
reappear
and
i
had
sufficient
discretion
to
refrain
from
asking
questions
we
advanced
under
the
gate
roof
our
presence
loudly
announced
by
the
scuffle
of
my
sandals
and
the
clang
of
my
clogs
on
the
stone
flagging
a
number
of
helmeted
guards
started
out
at
us
from
either
side
but
they
fell
back
on
the
instant
and
their
ready
salutes
told
me
that
my
companion
was
the
captain
of
the
gate
without
a
pause
we
passed
on
through
and
out
across
the
high
bridge
that
spanned
the
moat
from
the
centre
of
the
arch
i
could
look
over
at
the
verandas
of
the
palace
at
the
far
side
of
the
bridge
we
came
to
a
second
gateway
the
heavy
doors
of
which
were
closed
and
barred
my
escort
spoke
to
one
of
the
guards
who
peered
out
at
us
from
the
projecting
window
and
after
a
short
delay
a
small
side
wicket
was
unbarred
for
us
we
crept
through
and
passed
between
two
groups
of
silent
guards
and
up
a
short
avenue
of
cryptomerias
to
the
nearest
wing
of
the
palace
after
leaving
the
gate
we
met
no
one
until
we
had
reached
the
palace
veranda
and
removed
our
footwear
to
enter
as
we
crossed
the
polished
planks
one
of
the
screens
of
the
unlighted
room
within
slid
open
before
an
official
at
sight
of
me
the
man
halted
abruptly
where
the
glow
of
the
porch
lanterns
shone
full
upon
his
face
it
was
gengo
the
chamberlain
never
had
i
seen
a
man
more
startled
he
stood
with
jaw
dropped
and
eyes
distended
glaring
as
if
i
were
a
ghost
or
demon
politely
ignoring
the
strange
conduct
of
his
superior
officer
the
gate
captain
saluted
and
smilingly
stated
his
errand
has
been
given
that
my
lord
is
to
be
conducted
into
the
presence
of
the
gengo
sank
down
and
kowtowed
at
my
feet
is
implored
for
the
inexcusable
carelessness
of
my
humble
servant
he
mumbled
was
necessary
to
leave
my
lord
alone
in
the
garden
i
returned
with
utmost
haste
but
my
lord
had
vanished
and
i
could
not
find
him
i
was
returning
even
now
to
make
search
the
shogun
has
summoned
my
he
rose
and
bowed
me
to
follow
him
i
signed
to
the
old
gate
captain
who
appeared
to
consider
the
final
words
of
the
chamberlain
as
a
dismissal
with
me
to
the
threshold
of
the
audience
chamber
i
said
gengo
nodded
to
the
guardsman
and
smiled
blandly
commands
of
my
lord
are
the
pleasure
of
his
servants
he
murmured
the
readiness
of
his
assent
lessened
my
suspicion
of
the
fellow
but
as
we
entered
the
dark
interior
i
took
the
precaution
of
keeping
near
the
captain
i
could
not
tell
for
certain
whether
the
chamberlain
had
knowingly
led
me
into
an
ambush
in
the
garden
yet
if
innocent
why
had
he
been
so
startled
at
my
appearance
at
first
thought
his
terror
seemed
an
unmistakable
confession
of
guilt
then
i
remembered
his
fear
in
the
presence
of
the
shogun
and
coupled
it
with
his
present
haste
and
his
no
less
feverish
eagerness
in
fetching
me
to
the
citadel
was
it
not
probable
that
he
had
blundered
his
orders
in
the
confusion
of
the
panic
and
now
feared
that
i
would
make
complaint
one
thing
alone
was
certain
this
time
he
was
intent
on
avoiding
all
mistakes
voluntary
or
involuntary
straight
as
the
lay
of
the
rooms
and
corridors
would
permit
he
led
the
way
through
the
wing
of
the
palace
and
around
the
end
of
an
inner
garden
court
a
few
steps
more
and
we
came
into
a
dimly
lighted
anteroom
where
guards
and
chamberlains
crouched
in
waiting
flushed
and
with
excitement
but
silent
as
death
beyond
sounded
a
murmuring
of
low
voices
gengo
pointed
to
my
sword
and
dirk
i
drew
them
from
my
girdle
with
their
scabbards
and
handed
them
to
the
old
gate
captain
the
chamberlain
whispered
to
a
who
was
kneeling
close
beside
the
wall
at
the
upper
end
of
the
room
the
latter
at
once
drew
open
one
of
the
screens
and
gengo
entered
on
hands
and
knees
i
stepped
forward
to
follow
him
the
doorkeeper
whispered
a
startled
command
for
me
to
kneel
but
rather
than
crawl
into
the
presence
of
their
ruler
in
the
posture
of
a
dog
i
preferred
that
the
japanese
should
consider
me
ignorant
or
even
insolent
to
the
horror
of
the
doorkeeper
i
strode
into
the
audience
chamber
proudly
erect
the
large
room
before
me
was
flooded
with
the
soft
rays
of
many
lamps
and
lanterns
in
the
centre
of
the
apartment
the
shogun
sat
upon
a
low
dais
close
before
which
to
right
and
left
were
grouped
the
few
persons
in
attendance
i
saw
the
long
aristocratic
face
of
the
prince
of
owari
and
heavy
german
visage
on
the
left
of
the
throne
across
from
them
knelt
midzuano
the
chief
counsellor
and
three
others
whose
faces
were
turned
from
me
i
gathered
that
the
shogun
had
called
together
an
informal
council
of
the
leaders
of
both
factions
in
the
hope
of
uniting
them
in
the
face
of
the
supposed
peril
to
all
unable
to
wait
for
the
slow
crawl
of
gengo
i
stepped
past
him
up
the
room
and
heedless
of
imperative
gesture
to
fall
upon
hands
and
knees
crossed
swiftly
over
the
intervening
mats
to
the
dais
as
i
knelt
to
kowtow
the
man
beside
midzuano
turned
and
i
saw
the
beautiful
vindictive
face
of
young
keiki
i
rose
and
slipped
aside
towards
satsuma
keiki
and
midzuano
were
glancing
up
at
the
shogun
with
eager
expectancy
beneath
their
court
smiles
the
outrageous
conduct
of
the
barbarian
had
laid
him
open
to
severe
punishment
the
two
other
men
who
were
unknown
to
me
regarded
me
in
a
neutral
manner
i
deepened
my
smile
and
looked
up
into
the
gloomy
face
of
iyeyoshi
lord
comes
quickly
in
response
to
our
summons
he
said
in
a
colorless
tone
and
he
signed
to
gengo
to
withdraw
highness
would
have
found
me
in
attendance
much
sooner
had
i
not
been
led
astray
in
the
palace
gardens
i
replied
keeping
a
side
glance
on
midzuano
and
keiki
the
latter
flushed
with
a
momentary
outflashing
of
chagrin
the
chief
counsellor
stared
at
me
with
his
dull
unblinking
gaze
and
gave
no
sign
astray
in
the
gardens
questioned
the
shogun
sunset
your
highness
on
my
way
to
owari
yashiki
from
the
high
court
gengo
overtook
me
with
word
that
my
presence
was
required
at
the
sunset
command
was
not
sent
until
after
the
arrival
of
owari
highness
murmured
midzuano
the
need
for
the
presence
of
the
command
was
sent
by
your
humble
counsellor
the
owes
the
credit
of
his
quick
appearance
before
your
highness
to
the
forethought
of
one
whom
he
unjustly
considers
an
enemy
i
venture
to
speak
because
my
sole
desire
is
the
safety
and
honor
of
the
shogunate
all
friends
of
nippon
must
forget
past
differences
and
unite
in
the
face
of
the
invading
the
adroitness
astonished
me
in
a
few
words
he
had
claimed
credit
for
foresight
moderation
and
patriotism
had
accused
me
of
cherishing
undeserved
enmity
against
him
and
had
diverted
the
attention
of
all
to
the
burning
question
of
the
american
expedition
in
such
manner
as
to
rouse
suspicion
against
me
and
increase
their
fear
and
hatred
of
the
supposed
invaders
he
need
have
had
no
apprehension
that
i
would
complain
of
the
treacherous
attack
in
the
garden
vindictive
look
had
quickened
my
suspicions
to
moral
certainty
but
this
was
not
the
time
to
speak
of
a
matter
that
involved
azai
highness
i
said
deepening
my
smile
wise
chief
counsellor
has
spoken
well
according
to
his
limited
information
he
should
not
be
blamed
if
at
such
a
time
of
panic
and
confusion
he
permits
inquietude
to
so
disturb
his
sound
judgment
that
he
states
what
is
not
true
it
is
a
false
rumor
that
says
the
americans
have
come
to
invade
cried
keiki
when
the
black
ships
have
entered
yedo
bay
in
defiance
of
the
edict

the
dutch
told
the
shogunate
to
expect
the

did
not
say
that
the
american
ships
would
come
to
yedo

said
the
older
of
the
two
strange
who
sat
between
me
and
keiki

the
dutch
know

voice

with
depth
and
power
dutch

a
little

well
set

ancient

immutable
they
may
not
be
set

murmured
midzuano
i
heard
that
the
council
of
elders
has
punished
those
who
study
the
dutch
learning
or
those
who
teach
the
history
of
nippon
demanded

crimes
forbidden
under
penalty
of
death

a
prince

will
soon
bring
you
the
exact
count
of
the
ships
in
the
fleet
of
the
american
envoy
others
may
have
joined
those
which
i
saw
assembled
in
china
yet
i
can
state
with
certainty
that
all
told
they
will
number
less

ten

place

is
well
to

credit
for
their

in
the
destruction
of

i
have
heard
that
the

on

not

could
do
no
better

well
my
countrymen
come
in
peace
desirous
of
honorable
friendship
with
the
people
of
dai
nippon
but
they
are
not
swordless
are
the
barbarians
bred
retorted
keiki
five
years
have
passed
since
two
american
warships
ventured
to
approach
yedo
bay
the
report
can
not
be
doubted
that
their
great
lord
was
flung
back
into
his
boat
by
a
common
sailor
of
nippon
when
he
sought
to
come
aboard
the
ship
of
the
japanese
shame
of
that
insult
is
upon
nippon
i
said
keeping
to
my
court
smile
though
my
face
burned
with
hot
anger
at
the
jibe
august
ruler
of
america
had
given
strict
command
that
the
people
of
nippon
should
be
shown
utmost
courtesy
and
friendliness
the
american
commander
was
urgently
asked
to
come
aboard
the
junk
to
receive
the
letter
of
his
highness
as
a
token
of
honor
to
his
highness
he
came
alongside
the
junk
and
was
boarding
the
vessel
when
the
outrage
occurred
believing
that
the
insult
was
the
act
of
the
sailor
alone
commodore
biddle
restrained
his
just
resentment
and
left
the
punishment
of
the
sailor
to
the
laws
of
nippon
we
have
a
saying
that
only
savages
and
persons
of
low
intellect
mistake
moderation
for
speaks
wisely
said
the
shogun
have
now
spoken
except
ii
what
has
naosuke
to
say
the
between
abe
and
keiki
bowed
forward
to
respond
though
a
man
still
under
forty
the
intellect
and
power
in
his
smooth
face
was
quite
sufficient
to
explain
to
me
the
respectful
attention
with
which
all
awaited
his
words
highness
he
said
is
humbly
offered
that
too
little
is
now
known
for
final
decision
the
counsel
of
owari
dono
and
satsuma
to
inquire
the
purpose
of
the
american
envoy
is
thought
wise
no
less
the
counsel
of
midzuano
and
keiki
to
assemble
a
force
of
and
artillery
against
attack
the
course
of
wisdom
is
for
all
parties
to
unite
their
strength
under
your
time
has
come
for
all
loyal
subjects
to
join
together
forgetful
of
past
enmities
purred
midzuano
is
the
time
to
bind
up
old
wounds
and
cover
old
scars
for
the
sake
of
common
preservation
humble
request
is
made
that
owari
dono
join
in
petitioning
for
the
freedom
of
one
who
would
prove
a
tower
of
strength
to
nippon
the
wise
and
brave
rekko
prince
of
the
prince
of
owari
bowed
with
a
smile
as
suave
as
the
subtle
is
certain
that
midzuano
has
at
heart
only
the
honor
and
glory
of
his
highness
he
murmured
claims
a
still
higher
degree
of
loyalty
if
such
be
possible
the
present
moment
is
one
of
confusion
and
uncertainty
all
men
respect
the
counsel
of
ii
he
has
said
that
too
little
is
now
known
for
final
i
saw
keiki
blink
his
narrow
lids
to
hide
the
fierce
flash
of
his
eyes
midzuano
turned
with
an
indifferent
bearing
to
look
down
the
chamber
the
shogun
made
a
slight
sign
i
glanced
about
and
saw
gengo
creeping
forward
on
his
knees
with
a
scroll
upraised
before
him
on
a
tray
he
kowtowed
and
murmured
almost
inaudibly
to
the
council
of
elders
from
yezaimon
governor
of
iyeyoshi
signed
him
towards
midzuano
who
took
the
scroll
and
at
a
nod
from
the
shogun
read
the
message
aloud
the
august
council
of
elders
report
is
hereby
humbly
submitted
that
shortly
after
midday
four
warships
of
the
hairy
barbarians
two
being
of
vast
size
entered
the
mouth
of
the
inner
bay
and
without
sail
proceeded
against
wind
and
tide
to
an
anchorage
within
close
view
of
uraga
being
boarded
by
the
second
in
command
at
uraga
his
request
that
the
black
ships
proceed
to
nagasaki
was
peremptorily
denied
demand
was
made
that
all
be
withdrawn
the
barbarian
commander
is
said
to
be
of
such
exalted
rank
that
only
may
be
admitted
into
his
presence
he
comes
as
an
envoy
from
the
country
called
the
united
states
of
america
he
bears
a
letter
from
the
ruler
of
america
to
his
highness
the
shogun
alleged
to
contain
requests
for
friendship
and
intercourse
statement
is
made
that
if
such
letter
is
not
honorably
received
at
uraga
the
black
ships
will
proceed
up
the
bay
and
deliver
the
letter
at
yedo
the
american
warships
are
very
powerful
and
are
armed
with
many
cannon
of
immense
size

of
uraga
of
as
the
reader
settled
back
on
his
heels
and
rolled
up
the
scroll
all
turned
to
the
shogun
he
spoke
with
quick
decision
counsel
of
ii
is
accepted
let
be
assembled
by
the
in
command
along
the
bay
to
guard
against
surprise
to
receive
the
communication
of
the
ruler
of
america
is
against
the
ancient
edict
so
grave
a
matter
as
setting
aside
the
edict
requires
deliberate
consideration
let
the
officials
at
uraga
negotiate
with
the
envoy
until
a
decision
may
be
reached
by
my
counsellors
permission
is
given
to
we
kowtowed
and
glided
from
the
audience
chamber
past
an
increeping
group
of
chamberlains
in
the
anteroom
when
i
received
back
my
sword
and
dirk
from
the
old
gate
captain
keiki
eyed
him
sharply
but
was
called
away
by
midzuano
ii
and
abe
followed
the
prince
satsuma
and
myself
through
another
exit
and
asked
me
many
politely
worded
questions
as
we
clattered
along
on
our
high
clogs
leaving
the
palace
enclosure
by
one
of
the
lesser
bridges
we
crossed
the
outer
enclosure
of
the
citadel
to
the
sakaruda
gate
through
a
small
army
of
grotesquely
armored
it
was
the
first
time
that
i
had
seen
japanese
in
full
and
bizarre
as
was
the
effect
of
their
dish
helmets
shoulder
brassards
and
the
padded
robes
under
their
plate
and
chain
mail
i
must
confess
that
they
presented
a
most
formidable
appearance
even
to
one
acquainted
with
modern
firearms
outside
the
sakaruda
gate
i
was
relieved
to
find
yoritomo
waiting
for
us
with
a
guard
of
half
a
thousand
owari
retainers
all
clad
in
armor
as
complete
as
that
of
the
he
himself
wore
a
wondrous
suit
of
gilded
armor
that
glittered
resplendent
in
the
light
of
the
swaying
lanterns
he
rode
an
armored
stallion
but
had
brought
a
for
me
the
need
of
this
escort
became
clear
when
we
marched
away
through
the
official
quarter
i
had
left
the
broad
streets
swarming
with
a
mob
i
came
back
to
find
them
all
but
jammed
with
mailed
and
helmetted
whose
wild
fear
had
given
place
to
the
fury
of
despair
many
among
them
for
the
most
part
mito
retainers
wore
their
armor
shrouded
with
white
mourning
robes
in
token
of
devotion
to
death
in
battle
ii
and
abe
had
turned
aside
to
their
which
were
near
at
hand
eastward
from
the
gate
we
moved
in
the
opposite
direction
and
having
escorted
satsuma
and
his
cortege
to
his
finally
won
our
way
through
the
crowded
streets
to
the
outer
moat
and
across
into
owari
yashiki
a
few
minutes
later
i
was
alone
in
my
apartments
with
yoritomo
relating
all
that
had
befallen
me
since
our
parting
at
sunset
throughout
the
account
my
friend
listened
with
intense
interest
but
with
no
comment
except
an
exclamation
of
profound
astonishment
that
the
princess
should
have
confessed
her
love
to
me
when
i
had
quite
finished
he
shook
his
head
in
a
puzzled
manner
and
said
all
the
temples
and
at
thousands
of
garden
shrines
prayers
are
being
made
for
the
gods
to
send
a
great
wind
against
the
if
all
the
are
as
favored
by
the
gods
as
one
i
know
there
will
be
no
have
won
the
favor
of
azai
how
can
i
fail
to
possess
the
favor
of
the
gods
i
replied
not
altogether
in
jest
he
clanked
his
golden
armor
in
an
impatient
gesture
we
speak
of
women
and
love
when
the
fate
of
nippon
hangs
in
the
balance
there
is
one
thing
you
have
not
told
me
what
was
the
message
yuki
handed
to
you
when
you
were
mounting
your
horse
he
says
that
a
gave
it
to
him
for
me
he
did
not
presume
to
read
it
but
as
he
could
not
reach
my
through
the
midst
of
the
satsuma
men
he
gave
the
note
to
you
not
knowing
that
you
can
not
read
i
searched
in
my
bosom
and
drew
out
a
crumpled
bit
of
paper
as
yoritomo
smoothed
it
on
the
palm
of
his
steel
gauntlet
he
nodded
writing
of
kohana
you
are
right
in
suspecting
that
the
attack
in
the
garden
enclosure
of
the
princess
was
not
due
to
chance
it
was
an
ambush
laid
by
keiki
and
midzuano
they
hoped
you
would
be
cut
down
by
the
as
you
entered
the
citadel
that
failing
gengo
deliberately
misled
you
into
the
forbidden
enclosure
of
the
women
that
midzuano
might
set
the
guards
of
the
inner
gate
upon
you
the
guards
did
not
know
it
was
a
plot
they
were
loyally
seeking
to
avenge
the
outrage
committed
by
one
of
the
hairy
barbarians
who
had
violated
the
sacred
enclosure
of
the
palace
women
none
other
than
azai
or
the
shoguness
could
have
saved
note
i
exclaimed
it
tell
all
that
the
lines
as
you
say
he
answered
and
he
read
the
writing
has
taken
pay
of
chapter
xxii
tea
with
the
tycoon
there
followed
four
days
of
anxious
waiting
though
the
prince
went
daily
to
the
palace
my
presence
was
not
commanded
and
in
the
continued
state
of
public
stress
and
turmoil
it
was
thought
best
that
yoritomo
and
i
should
keep
close
within
the
the
mito
faction
had
given
wide
publication
to
a
garbled
account
of
our
trial
which
libelled
us
with
the
stigma
of
confessed
spies
had
we
appeared
in
the
streets
of
the
official
quarter
before
excess
of
fury
had
exhausted
the
rancor
and
excitement
of
the
we
should
have
been
hacked
to
pieces
by
our
enemies
and
their
dupes
throughout
the
vast
extent
of
the
lower
city
the
panic
continued
without
cessation
day
and
night
the
populace
streamed
inland
by
thousands
bearing
upon
back
and
shoulder
their
household
goods
young
children
and
aged
mothers
skirting
along
the
outer
moat
of
the
official
quarter
the
bulk
of
the
refugees
from
the
southern
half
of
yedo
poured
past
owari
yashiki
in
an
endless
mob
all
alike
possessed
by
the
one
frantic
desire
to
place
themselves
beyond
reach
of
the
magic
cannon
yet
vast
as
was
the
multitude
of
townsfolk
that
poured
out
of
yedo
fully
a
third
were
replaced
by
the
and
that
rushed
in
to
the
defence
of
the
capitol
while
reports
were
received
that
the
down
the
bay
had
assembled
ten
thousand
men
within
the
first
two
days
the
clans
were
responding
to
the
call
of
the
shogunate
by
lining
up
to
present
a
solid
front
to
the
barbarians
had
there
been
confirmation
of
the
first
wild
rumor
that
the
black
ships
numbered
sixty
and
their
guns
six
hundred
or
had
commodore
perry
attempted
a
forceful
landing
the
heat
of
patriotic
loyalty
would
have
fused
even
the
icy
venom
of
the
hatred
between
owari
and
mito
but
the
commodore
though
firm
to
arrogance
took
utmost
care
to
avoid
all
acts
of
violence
and
his
squadron
was
not
large
enough
to
awe
the
mito
faction
into
forgetfulness
of
their
desire
to
overthrow
the
shogunate
at
last
after
much
debate
and
intrigue
the
prince
and
satsuma
backed
by
ii
won
a
denial
of
the
demand
of
keiki
and
midzuano
for
immediate
hostilities
the
american
envoy
having
resolutely
refused
to
go
to
nagasaki
and
having
again
threatened
to
ascend
the
bay
iyeyoshi
reluctantly
appointed
two
of
the
lesser
as
commissioners
to
receive
the
letter
of
the
president
of
the
united
states
together
with
the
news
of
this
victory
the
prince
brought
from
the
palace
the
command
for
yoritomo
to
break
the
seclusion
of
his
mourning
and
proceed
to
uraga
the
duty
assigned
him
was
secretly
to
check
the
interpreters
and
make
a
full
report
of
all
that
occurred
during
the
ceremony
of
receiving
the
letter
he
was
forbidden
on
pain
of
death
to
enter
into
any
communication
with
the
barbarians
this
was
during
the
afternoon
of
july
the
eleventh
yoritomo
and
i
sat
up
late
that
night
discussing
the
situation
he
pointed
out
the
extreme
precariousness
of
my
standing
as
a
supposed
spy
in
the
opinion
of
all
who
favored
mito
i
replied
that
with
the
risk
doubled
and
only
half
my
present
slender
chance
of
winning
my
little
princess
i
should
still
prefer
yedo
to
the
safety
of
the
warships
he
then
offered
to
smuggle
a
message
from
me
to
the
commodore
so
that
the
shogunate
might
be
warned
to
protect
me
from
harm
i
objected
that
i
did
not
wish
to
be
delivered
over
to
my
countrymen
and
taken
out
of
japan
that
the
discovery
of
such
an
attempt
to
communicate
would
mean
ruin
alike
to
us
and
to
his
plans
and
that
i
was
willing
to
face
the
risk
i
had
brought
upon
myself
by
coming
to
japan
with
him
so
it
was
that
my
friend
set
off
down
the
bay
the
next
morning
in
one
of
the
swift
government
pledged
to
silence
regarding
my
presence
in
yedo
had
he
not
given
me
his
word
all
the
watchfulness
of
the
dozen
attendants
and
spies
who
accompanied
him
would
have
failed
to
prevent
his
communicating
with
commodore
perry
his
departure
i
must
confess
left
me
more
than
lonely
the
prince
continued
to
spend
his
days
at
the
palace
either
opposing
midzuano
and
keiki
in
private
audience
or
planning
with
the
household
to
checkmate
the
intrigues
of
the
council
and
its
supporters
to
bring
about
an
attack
on
the
black
ships
at
last
about
noon
of
the
fifteenth
fujimaro
my
chamberlain
informed
me
that
i
was
commanded
to
appear
before
the
shogun
an
armed
escort
was
provided
for
me
with
yuki
now
my
swordbearer
in
command
and
i
was
borne
to
the
citadel
at
a
speed
that
in
less
strenuous
times
would
have
disgraced
the
house
of
owari
had
the
identity
of
the
occupant
been
suspected
by
the
who
still
thronged
the
streets
of
the
official
quarter
i
doubt
whether
we
should
have
reached
our
destination
without
a
bloody
fight
to
avoid
such
an
untimely
conflict
among
the
clans
instructions
had
been
given
to
admit
me
in
my
as
on
my
first
visit
through
the
heanzo
gate
at
the
head
of
kojimachi
street
my
guards
with
the
exception
of
yuki
and
fujimaro
were
required
to
wait
outside
the
gate
within
the
bastion
my
bearers
halted
and
set
down
the
i
peered
out
to
ask
yuki
the
reason
for
the
halt
he
had
stepped
aside
and
in
his
place
i
saw
gengo
bowing
and
smiling
with
irreproachable
suavity
across
the
garden
i
commanded
my
lord
murmured
the
fellow
is
required
that
my
lord
should
descend
and
come
with
me
have
been
commanded
to
appear
before
his
highness
i
said
can
i
trust
to
the
guidance
of
one
who
once
lost
me
in
a
certain
other
garden
he
faced
me
squarely
with
no
other
look
than
contrition
in
his
eyes
lord
covers
me
with
shame
he
replied
others
than
myself
were
dazed
by
the
great
fear
that
fell
upon
all
yedo
that
day
yet
my
lord
does
well
to
reproach
me
for
my
stupid
save
you
the
shame
of
repeating
the
error
i
will
ride
through
the
garden
as
on
my
first
gods
forbid
he
exclaimed
dropping
on
his
knees
his
voice
sank
to
a
faint
whisper
lord
it
is
not
permissible
my
lord
must
give
over
his
sword
and
dirk
and
come
with
me
i
smiled
pleasure
of
waiting
at
deserted
kiosks
is
not
always
time
there
will
be
no
need
to
wait
he
whispered
highness
is
in
the
garden
if
my
lord
doubts
let
him
demand
the
escort
of
the
gate
captain
but
he
must
leave
his
as
i
have
i
felt
the
brace
of
within
my
bosom
this
time
i
had
come
fully
prepared
i
called
yuki
and
fujimaro
sprang
to
assist
me
from
the
i
thrust
my
feet
into
the
clogs
held
by
them
and
handed
over
my
sword
and
dirk
to
yuki
am
ready
i
said
the
chamberlain
started
off
with
a
look
that
told
me
he
was
puzzling
to
surmise
whether
i
was
a
blind
fool
or
a
very
brave
man
either
i
had
been
too
obtuse
to
suspect
his
part
in
the
ambush
or
else
knowing
his
treachery
i
was
he
supposed
following
him
unarmed
into
another
secluded
garden
his
open
display
of
perplexity
convinced
me
that
he
now
had
no
treachery
in
mind
else
he
would
have
kept
closer
control
of
his
expression
without
a
second
backward
glance
he
led
the
way
at
a
rapid
pace
up
an
avenue
of
umbrella
pines
somewhat
over
a
quarter
of
a
mile
brought
us
to
a
narrow
path
that
crossed
the
avenue
at
right
angles
gengo
turned
to
the
left
up
the
new
way
i
felt
of
my
revolvers
and
clattered
after
him
he
came
to
a
rockery
bordered
with
dense
groves
an
ideal
place
for
an
ambush
i
stopped
short
he
went
on
a
few
steps
and
pointed
around
the
far
side
of
a
huge
rock
i
gripped
my
revolvers
and
advanced
beyond
the
boulder
the
rockery
opened
out
around
a
little
artificial
cliff
upon
the
crest
of
which
was
perched
a
small
through
the
latticed
end
of
the
building
i
perceived
a
figure
in
black
and
yellow
robes
i
waved
gengo
to
lead
on
we
skirted
around
to
the
right
and
came
upon
half
a
hundred
guards
in
full
for
a
moment
the
sight
of
their
flashing
lance
blades
horned
helmets
and
steel
mail
gave
me
a
lively
fright
i
half
halted
only
to
advance
again
as
i
saw
that
they
were
making
way
for
me
with
respectful
smiles
and
bows
gengo
passed
on
through
their
midst
and
ascended
a
narrow
wooden
stairway
that
led
up
the
rear
of
the
cliff
following
close
upon
his
heels
i
swung
up
after
him
and
around
the
enclosed
end
of
the
building
through
a
small
window
a
yard
or
so
short
of
the
second
corner
i
caught
a
glimpse
of
a
coiffure
the
sight
thrilled
me
with
the
thought
of
rapturous
possibilities
i
hastened
around
into
the
low
veranda
of
the
front
dropping
my
clogs
at
the
edge
in
imitation
of
gengo
a
few
steps
more
brought
us
into
the
presence
of
the
shogun
his
highness
was
seated
upon
a
low
divan
with
owari
dono
before
him
on
his
left
and
satsuma
on
his
right
as
we
rose
from
our
salute
gengo
placed
a
cushion
for
me
beside
the
prince
and
silently
withdrew
the
shogun
favored
me
with
a
slight
relaxation
of
his
austere
frown
sama
has
displayed
commendable
diligence
in
responding
to
our
command
he
said
will
of
minamoto
iyeyoshi
is
the
pleasure
of
those
who
desire
to
serve
him
i
responded
owari
and
satsuma
exchanged
glances
approving
the
politeness
of
my
phrasing
iyeyoshi
nodded
and
made
a
sign
to
the
prince
who
drew
forward
a
small
rosewood
case
richly
ornamented
with
gold
i
saw
at
a
glance
that
the
designs
were
not
japanese
i
thrilled
at
sight
of
the
eagles
from
the
box
the
prince
handed
to
me
an
official
document
written
in
english
and
sealed
in
gold
with
the
great
seal
of
the
united
states
of
america
i
raised
the
document
to
my
forehead
and
kowtowed
letter
of
the
president
i
murmured
commanded
the
shogun
taking
up
a
paper
written
in
classical
chinese
ideographs
the
prince
unrolled
a
similar
paper
while
satsuma
opened
a
dutch
writing
i
perceived
that
i
had
been
summoned
for
the
purpose
of
the
translations
of
yoritomo
and
the
official
interpreters
i
rose
to
my
knees
and
began
reading
the
document
in
my
best
japanese
fillmore
president
of
the
united
states
of
america
to
his
imperial
majesty
the
emperor
of
japan
great
and
good
friend
iyeyoshi
checked
me
with
a
gesture
difference
it
is
here
rendered
exalted
highness
the
you
say
highness
the
error
is
mine
your
highness
i
explained
terms
may
not
be
translated
literally
their
intent
is
to
express
supreme
such
case
said
satsuma
may
be
expected
to
claim
that
the
message
is
addressed
to
the
regularly
received
investiture
as
shogun
from
the
mikado
replied
iyeyoshi
frowning
rulership
of
nippon
is
in
my
hands
according
to
law
and
custom
i
am
not
the
first
shogun
to
be
addressed
as
and
letter
is
properly
received
by
your
highness
observed
the
prince
mikados
have
chosen
to
maintain
their
sacred
seclusion
for
generation
after
generation
it
is
for
your
highness
to
defend
the
domains
of
the
present
descendant
of
the
sun
goddess
and
inaugurate
a
glorious
cycle
for
dai
nippon
by
opening
the
land
to
bonds
of
ancient
laws
are
not
to
be
broken
without
deliberate
consideration
replied
the
shogun
and
he
signed
to
me
to
proceed
i
read
on
slowly
through
the
courteous
expression
of
friendship
and
of
desire
for
commercial
intercourse
the
arguments
regarding
the
mutual
advantages
of
trade
and
the
need
of
protection
to
the
shipwrecked
sailors
of
our
whalers
and
other
ships
at
almost
every
line
i
was
questioned
and
above
all
when
i
came
to
the
suggestion
that
the
laws
might
be
suspended
and
intercourse
tested
as
an
experiment
for
a
limited
period
this
proposal
received
the
hearty
approval
of
both
the
prince
and
satsuma
and
they
urged
its
acceptance
upon
the
shogun
he
asked
me
numerous
questions
about
treaties
between
the
western
nations
and
then
without
replying
to
his
advisers
commanded
me
to
proceed
as
i
finished
the
reading
and
returned
the
letter
to
its
case
the
shogun
turned
upon
satsuma
with
a
deepening
of
his
frown
speak
as
counsellor
for
the
barbarians
you
have
yet
to
refute
the
ten
reasons
for
war
set
forth
in
the
memorial
of
rekko
prince
of
the
daimio
took
a
scroll
from
his
sleeve
opened
it
and
ran
a
finger
down
the
vertical
lines
of
writing
as
he
spoke
his
comments
highness
it
is
true
that
in
the
past
the
armies
of
nippon
have
been
victorious
in
foreign
lands
but
the
do
not
come
as
invaders
it
is
no
disgrace
to
enter
into
honorable
treaty
with
peaceful
possessed
of
cannon
and
ships
nippon
may
again
win
glorious
victories
in
korea
and
china
added
the
prince
the
second
statement
went
on
satsuma
letter
declares
that
religion
is
a
matter
apart
from
the
policy
of
the
american
government
there
is
no
intent
to
force
the
doctrines
of
the
evil
sect
upon
us
as
to
the
question
of
trading
precious
goods
and
metals
for
those
we
do
not
want
the
nations
buy
only
what
they
desire
and
sell
what
they
please
we
can
do
the
same
mito
speaks
of
the
chinese
opium
war
if
we
accept
the
offer
of
friendly
intercourse
we
can
learn
the
ways
of
the
and
acquire
skill
in
their
methods
of
one
breath
mito
says
that
we
are
not
as
brave
and
strong
as
our
ancestors
and
in
the
next
urges
us
to
plunge
into
war
with
these
friendly
envoys
said
owari
defames
the
brave
who
have
rushed
to
the
defence
of
our
shores
and
then
asks
if
it
is
wise
to
disappoint
their
ignorant
desire
for
interests
of
dai
nippon
are
of
greater
moment
than
the
interests
of
the
clans
in
control
at
nagasaki
added
satsuma
haughty
demeanor
of
the
american
admiral
proves
that
the
american
government
has
honored
nippon
by
sending
an
envoy
of
exalted
rank
argued
the
prince
the
frogs
in
the
well
consider
the
presence
of
the
black
ships
an
insult
it
is
the
mito
faction
that
seeks
to
undermine
the
fear
and
respect
due
the
government
of
your
highness
should
such
disloyalty
continue
to
rouse
the
spirit
of
our
will
soon
be
presented
by
the
need
to
chastise
the
defamers
of
the
said
iyeyoshi
relaxing
his
frown
have
replied
to
the
memorial
and
in
part
refuted
its
statements
nevertheless
the
daimio
of
kaga
and
many
other
powerful
clan
leaders
support
mito
the
black
ships
soon
sail
they
will
not
return
for
a
long
period
we
have
ample
time
to
deliberate
over
our
answer
to
the
ruler
letters
will
be
sent
to
all
the
and
noted
officials
and
counsellors
in
dai
nippon
commanding
their
satsuma
bowed
more
pleased
i
fancied
than
the
prince
proceeding
is
without
precedent
your
highness
yet
none
may
doubt
that
it
is
the
course
of
the
shogun
touched
a
small
gong
a
screen
at
the
inner
corner
of
the
veranda
slid
open
and
o
setsu

kowtowed
on
the
the
shogun

a
sign
the
girl

highness
murmured
the
prince
sama
came
to
nippon
sincerely
desirous
of
rendering
a
service
of
friendship
and
good
will
your
highness
condescends
to
favor
him
but
mito
seeks
his
destruction
there
is
yet
time
to
send
him
aboard
one
of
the
black
ships
if
your
highness
considers
his
presence
in
yedo
woroto
wish
to
join
his
countrymen
demanded
the
shogun
land
of
the
gods
is
very
pleasant
to
me
your
highness
i
answered
do
not
wish
to
go
i
desire
to
remain
until
the
shogun
gazed
at
me
between
doubt
and
friendliness
prayer
of
woroto
is
granted
he
may
remain
in
yedo
at
least
until
the
return
of
the
black
ships
provided
he
is
willing
to
risk
the
consequences
should
the
counsel
of
mito
i
saw
a
slender
figure
bowing
forward
through
the
opening
in
the
screens
and
a
flood
of
color
leaped
into
my
face
highness
i
cried
will
gladly
risk
all
i
thank
you
for
your
gracious
permission
to
remain
the
shogun
stared
piercingly
into
my
flushed
face
then
turned
with
the
prince
and
satsuma
to
watch
azai
his
face
like
theirs
grave
almost
to
solemnity
with
slow
and
graceful
movements
that
followed
one
upon
the
other
with
the
precision
of
a
formal
ritual
my
little
princess
entered
with
a
brazier
upon
which
the
charcoal
glowed
in
a
tiny
crater
of
rock
crystal
setting
this
before
us
she
returned
to
fetch
one
at
a
time
tongs
kettle
dipper
tea
canister
bowls
and
various
other
tiny
utensils
throughout
the
bringing
and
arranging
of
this
equipment
the
profound
silence
was
broken
only
by
the
occasional
murmuring
of
set
phrases
azai
proceeded
with
utmost
grace
and
delicacy
too
intent
upon
the
correct
performance
of
the
tea
ceremony
to
venture
a
glance
at
me
the
tea
crushed
into
a
fine
powder
was
mixed
in
a
bowl
with
boiling
water
and
beaten
with
a
bamboo
whisk
that
my
darling
rolled
deftly
between
her
fingers
the
first
bowlful
of
the
tea
porridge
was
served
to
the
shogun
upon
a
tray
of
unvarnished
cypress
wood
which
was
then
set
aside
but
the
bowl
was
rinsed
and
filled
with
a
second
mixture
which
was
served
to
the
prince
on
a
tray
again
the
bowl
was
rinsed
and
used
to
serve
the
tea
to
satsuma
on
the
same
tray
last
of
all
azai
rinsed
the
bowl
and
prepared
my
tea
with
the
same
delicate
precision
and
grace
when
she
approached
to
serve
me
i
looked
to
see
her
blush
or
tremble
i
was
yet
to
learn
the
full
measure
of
a
japanese
holding
the
tray
on
a
level
with
her
adorable
little
chin
she
knelt
before
me
without
the
slightest
trace
of
a
quiver
beneath
her
gracious
smile
the
exquisitely
delicate
rose
tint
of
her
cheeks
neither
paled
nor
deepened
only
once
as
i
set
the
emptied
bowl
back
upon
the
tray
her
lowered
lashes
lifted
for
an
instant
to
disclose
to
me
a
glimpse
of
the
unfathomable
tenderness
and
love
in
the
depths
of
her
lustrous
eyes
with
the
same
slowness
and
solemnity
she
drew
back
and
proceeded
to
carry
out
the
brazier
and
service
in
set
order
while
her
father
the
prince
and
the
daimio
noted
the
last
stages
of
the
ritual
with
their
formal
phrases
i
sat
in
the
meek
attitude
of
a
neophyte
but
i
fear
i
gave
little
heed
to
the
solemn
ritual
all
too
soon
azai
kowtowed
and
disappeared
the
quaint
rite
was
at
an
end
that
she
should
have
come
and
gone
with
only
that
one
glance
and
never
a
word
for
me
went
far
to
lessen
the
joy
of
seeing
her
my
face
was
grave
when
the
shogun
looked
down
upon
me
he
nodded
approvingly
sama
seems
versed
in
the
pleasant
mystery
of
the
tea
ceremony
it
is
known
in
his
country
seek
to
learn
your
highness
the
ceremony
is
undeveloped
in
my
country
as
yet
the
drinking
of
tea
is
for
the
most
part
confined
to
our
the
word
set
loose
upon
me
a
flood
of
questions
with
regard
to
women
and
marriage
i
answered
as
best
i
could
as
i
anticipated
satsuma
and
the
prince
were
no
less
shocked
than
the
shogun
at
the
freedom
allowed
occidental
women
but
i
perceived
that
the
severity
of
his
look
softened
when
i
dwelt
upon
the
honor
and
respect
which
we
accord
our
wives
i
recalled
that
statement
of
kohana
san
that
minamoto
iyeyoshi
regarded
his
daughter
with
the
fondness
due
a
son
is
certain
that
the
peoples
reverse
many
of
the
rightful
rules
of
society
and
morals
yet
what
has
been
said
is
of
grave
interest
he
observed
sama
is
doubtless
aware
that
in
nippon
a
teacher
is
held
in
high
honor
as
the
temporary
father
of
his
pupils
the
children
of
the
shogun
should
not
remain
in
ignorance
of
the
i
kowtowed
to
hide
my
eager
delight
and
waited
in
keen
suspense
the
american
envoy
has
sailed
your
presence
will
be
required
until
then
he
dismissed
me
with
a
gesture
i
withdrew
to
rejoin
gengo
who
was
waiting
at
the
corner
of
the
kiosk
as
we
passed
the
window
a
face
appeared
within
and
i
again
met
the
loving
glance
of
my
little
princess
chapter
xxiii
lessons
and
love
my
impatience
over
the
delay
of
the
expedition
to
sail
at
once
may
well
be
imagined
at
last
on
the
morning
of
the
eighteenth
yoritomo
returned
home
with
the
welcome
news
that
the
squadron
had
weighed
anchor
and
put
out
to
sea
the
previous
day
he
had
much
to
say
of
the
display
on
either
side
when
commodore
perry
landed
at
gorihama
below
uraga
and
delivered
over
the
letter
to
toda
and
ido
on
the
following
day
the
black
ships
had
excited
much
apprehension
by
sailing
up
the
bay
almost
to
within
sight
of
yedo
i
listened
to
the
account
of
my
proceedings
with
an
indifference
that
astonished
me
thanks
to
my
long
intimacy
with
my
friend
the
few
weeks
of
my
stay
in
his
country
had
sufficed
to
initiate
me
into
the
life
and
customs
of
his
people
i
was
fascinated
by
the
spirit
yet
for
all
that
i
might
well
have
been
overcome
with
longing
at
the
news
of
the
departure
of
the
expedition
had
it
not
been
for
my
love
for
the
little
princess
yoritomo
had
made
me
a
friend
to
the
japanese
azai
made
me
a
japanese
true
to
the
word
the
official
report
of
the
sailing
of
the
american
squadron
brought
a
prompt
command
for
me
to
attend
upon
iyesada
sama
and
azai
sama
as
instructor
in
learning
the
time
appointed
was
early
the
following
morning
half
the
night
was
spent
listening
to
the
advice
of
yoritomo
who
feared
that
i
might
lose
all
by
betraying
my
love
in
the
presence
of
others
in
return
for
my
promise
to
be
as
discreet
as
circumstances
would
permit
he
agreed
to
lay
the
matter
before
his
father
and
seek
to
interest
him
in
my
preposterous
attempt
to
win
the
princess
armed
with
the
order
i
set
out
at
dawn
travelling
incognito
but
with
the
full
retinue
allowed
me
by
the
prince
on
the
one
side
of
my
walked
fujimaro
and
on
the
other
yuki
the
latter
now
fully
recovered
from
his
wounds
and
torture
carried
himself
with
the
dignified
assurance
of
the
finest
swordsman
in
yedo
through
my
palanquin
window
i
gazed
out
at
the
splendid
fellow
with
pride
he
was
my
own
personal
retainer
and
not
one
of
the
servants
of
the
house
of
owari
loaned
to
me
for
the
occasion
legally
he
was
no
more
a
member
of
the
clan
than
myself
his
family
had
been
enrolled
among
the
owari
retainers
but
he
himself
had
expressed
a
preference
to
be
received
into
my
service
the
prince
had
readily
agreed
to
this
arrangement
though
not
because
of
any
reluctance
to
accept
among
his
retainers
a
who
had
been
expelled
from
the
service
of
the
shogun
yoritomo
had
said
that
it
was
for
me
to
take
the
former
to
the
palace
but
i
felt
certain
that
the
shogun
would
not
consider
the
act
an
affront
should
he
so
regard
it
i
relied
upon
the
excuse
of
my
ignorance
and
my
need
for
a
personal
retainer
the
morning
was
still
fresh
when
we
entered
the
citadel
by
the
sakaruda
gate
having
the
order
for
passport
i
rode
through
and
did
not
descend
from
my
until
on
the
point
of
crossing
one
of
the
inner
moats
into
the
palace
grounds
here
i
was
met
by
gengo
the
chamberlain
as
ever
suave
to
obsequiousness
he
did
not
relish
the
entry
of
his
former
captain
into
the
palace
and
suggested
that
yuki
should
remain
with
the
rest
of
my
escort
but
with
due
regard
to
my
dignity
as
teacher
of
the
children
i
insisted
upon
the
attendance
of
both
yuki
and
fujimaro
my
determination
won
the
day
gengo
started
off
submissively
and
led
us
through
the
gardens
of
the
o
shiro
to
the
enclosure
of
the
secondary
palace
set
apart
for
the
use
of
the
heir
the
edifice
though
small
was
exquisitely
finished
in
several
woods
inlaid
in
designs
of
odd
beauty
i
would
have
been
quite
willing
however
to
forego
the
pleasure
of
viewing
the
artistic
decorations
of
the
waiting
room
as
well
as
the
enjoyment
of
the
customary
refreshment
that
was
served
me
yet
one
must
needs
cultivate
patience
if
he
would
dwell
among
an
oriental
people
found
me
still
cooling
my
heels
in
the
waiting
room
at
last
i
suppose
the
curiosity
overcame
his
inertia
gengo
reappeared
to
conduct
me
into
the
presence
of
the
heir
apparent
yuki
and
fujimaro
followed
me
to
the
threshold
of
the
audience
chamber
where
i
signed
to
gengo
to
take
my
sword
and
bear
it
in
for
me
he
demurred
with
the
statement
that
to
carry
the
sword
of
a
into
the
presence
of
iyesada
sama
was
not
permissible
well
i
replied
will
be
my
none
other
than
my
lord
may
i
shall
carry
it
in
myself
i
am
here
as
the
teacher
of
iyesada
sama
i
demand
the
deference
due
a
at
this
he
took
the
sword
from
me
and
knelt
to
enter
the
chamber
of
audience
i
walked
after
him
erect
the
slowness
of
our
progress
up
the
long
apartment
gave
me
ample
time
to
observe
the
place
and
its
occupants
all
one
side
of
the
chamber
was
open
upon
a
fantastic
garden
of
sand
and
rocks
representing
a
volcanic
seashore
its
bare
verdureless
stretch
contrasted
strongly
with
the
richness
and
of
the
decorations
my
attention
quickly
centred
upon
the
two
persons
seated
before
the
gorgeous
one
i
recognized
as
abe
the
elder
of
the
two
strange
at
the
conference
he
sat
on
the
left
of
a
young
man
whose
amiable
but
weak
face
answered
to
descriptions
of
the
epileptic
heir
apparent
as
i
stalked
up
the
room
behind
the
creeping
chamberlain
the
prince
and
his
companion
regarded
me
with
looks
of
surprise
that
quickly
deepened
to
resentment
the
was
presuming
to
swagger
into
the
presence
of
the
son
but
i
had
planned
my
course
and
was
sure
of
my
ground
when
within
a
short
distance
of
the
angry
sitters
i
paused
and
gazed
at
the
prince
in
stern
reproof
this
the
proper
manner
for
a
pupil
to
receive
his
teacher
i
demanded
it
be
that
iyesada
has
been
misinformed
as
to
the
purpose
of
my
visit
the
prince
turned
to
abe
with
a
look
of
bewilderment
as
if
seeking
aid
and
instruction
the
daimio
rose
and
signed
him
to
do
the
same
sama
is
implored
to
pardon
the
rudeness
he
said
is
offered
that
he
was
not
distinctly
announced
as
a
i
glanced
down
at
the
stooped
figure
of
gengo
offence
is
forgotten
mistakes
occur
even
with
the
best
of
intentions
i
have
come
at
the
command
of
the
shogun
to
instruct
his
son
in
abe
whispered
a
few
words
to
the
prince
who
promptly
stepped
away
from
his
seat
and
waved
me
to
it
with
a
graceful
bow
honorable
teacher
is
entreated
to
repose
himself
he
murmured
in
a
voice
so
like
his
as
to
startle
me
i
contrived
to
maintain
my
dignity
and
seated
myself
in
the
place
of
honor
with
my
sword
at
my
right
hand
as
gengo
withdrew
the
prince
seated
himself
on
my
left
between
me
and
abe
after
an
exchange
of
bows
and
formal
greetings
i
at
once
entered
upon
my
duties
by
inquiring
the
knowledge
of
the
outside
world
it
proved
to
be
scant
and
vague
yet
gave
me
a
basis
upon
which
to
build
as
a
beginning
i
gave
a
brief
explanation
of
the
relation
to
the
solar
system
this
though
quickly
grasped
by
abe
seemed
beyond
the
comprehension
of
the
prince
who
complained
that
so
strange
a
statement
could
not
be
reconciled
to
the
facts
that
the
sun
goddess
had
come
down
to
dai
nippon
and
that
dai
nippon
the
centre
of
the
universe
rested
upon
the
back
of
the
great
fish
when
i
sought
to
argue
the
matter
the
prince
became
excited
and
insisted
upon
the
truth
of
his
myths
with
childish
petulance
abe
intervened
with
tactful
diplomacy
and
i
perceiving
the
weakness
of
the
mind
waived
the
dispute
and
sought
to
divert
the
attention
of
my
pupil
with
descriptions
of
costume
and
architecture
this
proved
to
be
as
successful
as
my
first
attempt
had
been
unfortunate
iyesada
at
once
grew
tranquil
and
exhibited
the
utmost
curiosity
over
the
absurdities
of
the
hairy
barbarians
i
illustrated
my
descriptions
with
sketches
which
the
prince
copied
with
remarkable
facility
and
precision
had
i
given
way
to
the
desire
of
my
pupil
i
should
have
continued
with
him
all
day
but
i
had
not
come
to
the
palace
to
waste
all
my
time
on
this
unfortunate
epileptic
at
the
end
of
two
hours
i
informed
him
that
it
was
time
to
close
the
lesson
when
he
demurred
with
a
quick
return
of
petulance
i
stated
that
it
was
inadvisable
to
teach
him
more
at
this
time
since
i
wished
him
to
reduce
to
writing
all
the
information
he
had
received
abe
gravely
commended
my
plan
of
instruction
and
the
prince
at
once
deferred
to
his
companion
i
withdrew
having
taught
my
pupil
a
few
valuable
facts
along
with
a
mass
of
inconsequential
chaff
and
having
learned
in
turn
that
he
was
a
capricious
weakling
very
much
under
the
influence
of
the
quiet
abe
with
gengo
again
for
guide
we
left
the
enclosure
and
crossed
over
into
another
walled
subdivision
of
the
citadel
though
i
did
not
recognize
it
as
the
garden
in
which
i
had
met
the
princess
the
failure
may
have
been
due
to
an
approach
from
an
opposite
direction
enough
for
me
that
i
was
being
conducted
to
my
adorable
little
darling
this
time
there
was
no
delay
yuki
and
fujimaro
were
left
in
an
anteroom
and
i
was
conducted
to
the
seat
of
honor
in
the
adjoining
reception
chamber
the
room
which
was
decorated
with
elegant
simplicity
overlooked
a
miniature
landscape
garden
of
rocks
and
ferns
and
dwarfed
trees
hardly
had
gengo
withdrawn
to
the
anteroom
when
a
side
screen
drew
aside
to
admit
a
dozen
or
more
demure
and
graceful
ladies
they
ranged
themselves
along
the
side
of
the
room
midway
down
and
kowtowed
to
me
as
i
nodded
with
the
austerity
becoming
a
in
the
presence
of
women
o
setsu
san
entered
and
knelt
close
after
appeared
my
little
princess
smiling
yet
demure
composed
yet
graciously
eager
to
welcome
her
august
teacher
softly
she
glided
out
past
her
and
sank
down
before
me
with
her
white
forehead
upon
the
mat
thousand
felicitous
years
to
my
lord
woroto
she
murmured
good
wish
of
azai
sama
is
acknowledged
i
replied
august
lady
is
requested
to
seat
herself
at
the
left
hand
of
her
my
lord
but
it
is
not
permissible
for
a
woman
to
sit
in
the
presence
of
one
so
vastly
above
two
boxes
of
this
height
be
brought
i
ordered
holding
my
hand
at
the
height
of
a
chair
o
setsu
san
glided
out
and
returned
in
a
few
moments
with
a
pair
of
lacquered
cases
about
the
size
of
tea
chests
i
signed
her
to
set
them
down
near
the
side
of
the
room
that
faced
the
garden
teacher
of
the
learning
and
customs
i
explained
will
begin
by
showing
the
princess
the
etiquette
practised
between
a
gentleman
and
a
lady
the
princess
will
be
pleased
to
act
as
i
rose
and
offered
her
my
hand
i
have
the
pleasure
of
assisting
you
to
rise
azai
glanced
up
at
me
with
a
startled
look
i
smiled
august
lady
is
to
take
my
hand
and
say
are
very
are
very
kind
my
lord
she
whispered
and
half
averting
her
head
she
entrusted
one
of
her
tiny
hands
to
me
i
drew
her
up
stepped
back
and
swept
her
a
bow
in
occidental
style
me
to
conduct
you
to
a
she
looked
at
me
in
a
puzzled
manner
and
i
explained
with
utmost
gravity
will
bow
no
not
to
the
floor
only
a
little
more
than
i
in
this
fashion
so
that
is
better
now
place
the
fingers
of
one
hand
upon
my
the
tips
of
her
fingers
touched
the
silk
sleeve
of
my
proffered
arm
with
the
lightness
of
a
perching
butterfly
i
escorted
her
to
the
nearest
chest
bowed
and
turned
back
for
a
cushion
placing
it
upon
the
chest
i
took
her
hand
and
assisted
her
to
seat
herself
facing
the
garden
but
when
i
drew
the
other
chest
nearer
and
was
about
to
sit
she
stopped
me
with
a
quick
little
cry
and
fluttered
back
to
fetch
me
my
cushion
from
before
the
as
she
knelt
to
place
it
on
my
chest
i
looked
down
at
her
with
severity
august
lady
forgets
that
she
is
receiving
a
my
lord
but
could
i
permit
my
august
teacher
to
seat
himself
without
his
cushion
august
lady
will
remember
that
she
is
receiving
a
lesson
in
etiquette
among
my
people
the
gentleman
always
attends
upon
the
so
preposterous
a
reversal
of
all
the
rules
of
propriety
compelled
the
bevy
of
ladies
across
the
room
from
us
to
murmur
in
astonishment
but
azai
meekly
permitted
me
to
assist
her
again
to
her
seat
before
seating
myself
i
assumed
my
austere
manner
and
sought
to
forestall
criticism
by
another
explanation
august
lady
is
now
to
converse
freely
as
to
an
equal
on
music
and
art
and
flower
arrangements
and
the
amusements
permitted
young
i
glanced
across
at
the
quickly
as
they
lowered
their
eyes
i
caught
their
stare
of
mingled
curiosity
wonder
and
merriment
only
setsu
was
regarding
me
with
a
frown
she
was
not
pleased
with
the
game
i
was
playing
in
the
face
of
all
present
and
perhaps
of
some
not
present
it
is
easy
to
make
a
through
a
paper
screen
but
i
had
gone
too
far
to
withdraw
i
seated
myself
and
with
a
wave
of
my
hand
towards
the
garden
murmured
ardently
we
must
make
gestures
and
pretend
to
be
talking
of
flowers
and
art
but
you
know
what
my
heart
burns
to
say
to
you
lord
love
is
surely
a
gift
of
the
gods
all
these
days
i
have
been
wrapped
about
as
it
were
in
a
dream
of
wonder
and
delight
how
is
it
possible
that
so
low
and
mean
a
creature
as
i
can
be
loved
by
my
lord
an
angel
a
low
or
mean
creature
little
princess
because
you
are
in
the
world
the
sun
is
bright
the
moon
silvery
the
stars
twinkle
with
joy
when
you
smile
up
into
the
gloomy
sky
i
have
no
need
to
see
the
cherry
blossoms
of
nippon
i
have
seen
you
when
you
speak
i
fancy
the
nightingale
is
singing
lord
she
whispered
praise
is
as
far
above
my
worthlessness
as
the
sun
above
the
abyss
may
kwannon
grant
me
the
joy
of
serving
my
lord
for
the
space
of
seven
existences
all
time
azai
we
shall
be
linked
together
in
mutual
love
and
service
we
are
fated
to
be
united
throughout
lord
she
murmured
and
she
turned
to
bend
to
me
her
dark
eyes
beaming
with
unutterable
love
and
devotion
to
the
front
i
warned
her
and
again
i
pointed
to
the
garden
as
if
remarking
upon
one
of
the
dwarfed
trees
she
recovered
her
composure
on
the
instant
yet
i
perceived
that
the
situation
was
more
difficult
than
i
had
the
right
to
require
of
her
i
turned
to
the
rear
and
remarked
my
people
it
is
customary
for
ladies
to
entertain
visitors
with
azai
turned
about
also
and
made
a
sign
to
setsu
the
girl
went
out
with
a
companion
and
brought
in
a
an
instrument
resembling
a
large
horizontal
harp
or
zithern
this
was
an
agreeable
surprise
to
me
so
far
i
had
heard
only
the
of
the
and
their
notes
are
particularly
discordant
to
occidental
ears
now
i
was
to
hear
the
instrument
of
the
ladies
played
by
none
other
than
azai
herself
she
adjusted
the
ivory
plectrums
upon
her
plump
little
fingers
and
kneeling
beside
the
began
to
play
though
mostly
in
the
minor
key
and
full
of
quick
transitions
that
were
often
discordant
to
me
her
music
had
many
passages
of
plaintive
sweetness
my
enjoyment
may
have
been
due
in
part
to
the
personality
of
the
player
for
the
occidental
ear
is
not
attuned
to
oriental
music
yet
the
is
certainly
far
more
harmonious
than
the
twanging
when
the
princess
finished
playing
i
called
for
writing
materials
and
attempted
by
means
of
words
and
drawings
to
describe
the
harpsichord
and
pianoforte
i
used
one
of
the
chests
as
a
table
for
drawing
my
figures
and
it
was
necessary
for
azai
to
kneel
across
from
me
that
she
might
bend
near
enough
to
follow
the
lines
i
drew
to
illustrate
my
explanations
it
was
natural
that
our
glances
should
meet
i
saw
my
soul
in
her
sweet
eyes
in
the
midst

azai

up
to

slender
figure

me
and

chamberlain

it

the

up
into
mine
with
that
light
of
utter
devotion

i
died
she
also
would
die
there
was
no
hope
of
dissuading
her

and
proceeded
with
gengo
and
one
of
the
other
officials
hastening
along
a
broad
corridor
we
soon
came
to
a
room
full
of
armed
guards
who
crouched
in
a
peculiar
posture
with
hands
on
their
swordhilts
as
though
about
to
leap
up
the
room
was
without
screens
along
the
hall
but
was
closed
on
the
side
adjoining
the
audience
chamber
into
which
the
corridor
opened
a
few
paces
farther
on
at
the
threshold
the
second
official
halted
gengo
kowtowed
and
began
to
crawl
up
the
mats
of
the
audience
hall
the
shogun
was
seated
on
a
low
dais
behind
which
a
group
of
guards
crouched
in
the
same
posture
as
those
in
the
anteroom
before
the
shogun
on
the
right
knelt
five
officials
of
these
the
nearest
one
to
the
dais
was
midzuano
from
which
i
inferred
that
the
four
others
were
his
of
the
council
of
elders
all
turned
and
stared
at
me
as
i
stalked
up
the
chamber
after
gengo
but
the
shogun
sat
with
eyes
downcast
contemplating
the
fan
which
he
held
unopened
upon
his
lap
several
mats
short
of
the
dais
gengo
kowtowed
and
drew
aside
i
advanced
much
nearer
kowtowed
and
rose
to
my
knees
to
face
the
shogun
my
heart
sank
his
gloomy
eyes
were
fixed
upon
me
in
a
menacing
stare
it
was
evident
that
he
was
greatly
angered
at
me
and
midzuano
was
present
to
spur
him
on
to
extremes
i
contrived
to
smile
and
utter
a
phrase
highness
has
commanded
the
hastens
to
render
is
ill
advised
to
use
the
word
rejoined
the
shogun
harshly
is
said
that
woroto
has
taken
into
his
service
yuki
the
such
an
act
can
not
be
regarded
other
than
as
a
reflection
upon
my
highness
i
replied
is
the
glory
of
japanese
justice
that
deeds
are
considered
in
the
light
of
motives
and
circumstances
doubtless
the
members
of
the
august
elder
council
have
sought
to
persuade
your
highness
that
i
made
yuki
my
swordbearer
with
the
deliberate
intent
to
affront
the
shogun
in
such
matters
your
highness
certain
classes
of
the
peoples
are
very
on
my
honor
as
a
man
of
highest
birth
among
my
people
i
say
that
if
such
an
allegation
has
been
made
it
is
a
malicious
lie
and
speaks
with
an
excess
of
heat
murmured
the
chief
counsellor
him
give
proof
that
he
is
let
my
defamer
give
proof
of
the
charge
against
me
i
retorted
do
not
deny
having
taken
the
into
your
service
said
the
shogun
the
midst
of
my
trial
before
the
high
court
your
highness
the
daimio
of
satsuma
interposed
to
save
yuki
from
further
torture
and
honored
him
with
a
priceless
gift
does
midzuano
charge
the
daimio
with
affronting
your
highness
lord
of
satsuma
did
not
take
the
into
his
the
reason
your
highness
that
i
spoke
first
ask
the
daimio
if
he
does
not
regret
his
delay
yet
any
thought
of
aspersion
upon
the
justice
of
your
highness
was
as
far
from
my
mind
as
from
the
and
in
justice
to
a
most
loyal
subject
i
must
declare
that
among
all
the
there
is
none
truer
than
yuki
in
the
hour
of
humiliation
the
brave
man
bowed
to
the
justice
of
his
lord
without
a
murmur
so
devoted
was
his
loyalty
that
he
endured
torture
rather
than
testify
against
those
who
had
saved
the
daughter
of
your
highness
from
the
shogun
bent
towards
me
with
sudden
deepening
of
his
frown
barbarian
do
you
dare
speak
of
your
artifice
artifice
your
highness
you
deny
that
the
attack
of
the
was
a
prearranged
plot
by
which
you
and
yoritomo
profited
demanded
midzuano
the
subtle
intriguer
was
actually
charging
us
with
the
villainy
of
his
own
party
the
sudden
springing
of
the
snare
caused
me
to
hesitate
cried
the
shogun
and
your
accomplices
knew
beforehand
of
the
knew
beforehand
that
keiki
had
plotted
the
attack
set
the
mito
upon
the
cortege
of
the
princess
expecting
to
rescue
her
at
the
last
moment
and
so
gain
the
favor
of
your
i
not
foretell
to
your
highness
that
they
would
seek
to
divert
the
charge
of
guilt
from
themselves
by
some
such
incredible
tale
murmured
the
chief
counsellor
sama
did
not
appear
until
after
the
massacre
but
this
and
his
followed
the
cortege
in
disguise
from
beyond
the
outer
moat
if
they
knew
beforehand
of
the
intended
attack
and
were
innocent
of
complicity
why
did
they
not
warn
the
cortege
to
refute
such
subtleness
was
beyond
me
the
best
i
could
do
was
to
assume
a
bold
front
a
kinsman
of
owari
i
do
not
choose
to
answer
the
queries
of
the
partisan
of
mito
i
declared
even
to
explain
why
you
held
off
until
the
had
slaughtered
the
and
why
the
fled
before
two
men
when
they
had
slain
a
score
interrogated
midzuano
me
a
sword
and
confront
me
with
a
mito
partisan
in
full
armor
i
rejoined
reason
for
the
fleeing
of
the
will
shortly
be
made
of
the
attack
and
of
yuki
the
said
the
shogun
remains
a
matter
that
more
nearly
concerns
my
honor
gengo
will
repeat
his
account
of
the
outrageous
conduct
of
the
in
the
palace
of
the
i
flushed
crimson
with
rage
the
treacherous
chamberlain
had
stolen
out
during
my
instruction
of
azai
to
aid
midzuano
in
setting
this
snare
for
my
destruction
i
met
the
gaze
of
the
shogun
with
a
look
as
angry
as
his
own
and
said
with
deliberate
reproof
my
land
men
of
noble
blood
do
not
publicly
discuss
matters
concerning
he
made
a
sign
with
his
fan
and
commanded
others
than
midzuano
will
withdraw
beyond
matter
is
between
your
highness
and
myself
i
said
life
is
in
the
hand
of
minamoto
iyeyoshi
rather
than
speak
in
the
presence
of
a
third
person
i
am
prepared
to
die
without
benefit
of
the
shogun
again
signed
with
his
fan
midzuano
rose
to
his
knees
and
shuffled
away
after
the
others
i
was
left
alone
in
front
of
the
dais
still
too
angry
to
flinch
before
the
frown
and
the
menace
of
his
eyes
highness
has
condemned
me
without
a
hearing
i
charged
that
the
boasted
justice
of
dai
nippon
insolence
is
of
itself
worthy
of
death
he
exclaimed
highness
i
replied
come
of
a
family
so
proud
that
it
is
a
degradation
for
me
to
kowtow
even
before
the
exalted
ruler
of
nippon
yet
my
desire
to
serve
has
caused
me
to
humble
rudeness
of
the
might
be
forgiven
on
the
plea
of
his
ignorance
not
so
an
insult
to
the
princess
my
highness
has
listened
to
the
lying
tales
of
my
enemies
i
would
sooner
strike
off
my
right
hand
than
insult
the
princess
azai
your
highness
does
ill
to
heed
the
malicious
slanders
of
those
who
condemned
me
on
false
charges
and
who
when
baffled
by
the
command
of
your
highness
laid
an
ambush
for
me
in
the
garden
of
the
the
garden
of
the
princess
ambush
he
repeated
the
first
day
of
the
panic
i
said
and
i
gave
him
a
concise
account
of
all
that
had
occurred
from
the
interruption
of
my
passage
to
owari
yashiki
by
gengo
to
my
rescue
by
the
princess
on
the
bridge
he
muttered
when
i
came
to
a
pause
can
not
put
to
torture
a
man
whom
she
highness
i
replied
hastening
to
take
advantage
of
this
betrayal
of
tenderness
happiness
of
a
child
is
one
of
the
fondest
wishes
of
a
parent
i
ask
permission
to
speak
openly
after
the
manner
of
my
he
studied
me
for
some
moments
between
curiosity
and
rankling
anger
curiosity
won
according
to
the
manner
of
your
people
he
commanded
i
bowed
your
highness
bear
in
mind
that
whatever
i
say
though
contrary
to
japanese
etiquette
is
spoken
with
utmost
deference
and
respect
for
yourself
and
the
princess
he
repeated
masking
his
anger
behind
an
inscrutable
calm
the
first
place
i
began
highness
should
know
that
yoritomo
sama
my
friend
and
brother
in
spirit
has
vowed
to
enter
the
monastery
of
zozoji
your
highness
may
recall
the
statement
of
azai
sama
made
upon
the
occasion
of
my
first
audience
with
your
highness
in
the
chief
temple
of
shiba
below
the
image
of
the
goddess
of
mercy
was
where
the
princess
and
i
first
gazed
into
each
the
shogun
started
and
a
threatening
flash
shot
from
his
sombre
eyes
but
again
he
masked
all
feeling
behind
a
look
of
inquisitorial
coldness
i
continued
it
an
error
to
believe
that
my
meetings
with
the
august
lady
have
been
guided
by
a
higher
cause
than
human
will
or
blind
chance
as
i
have
said
we
first
saw
one
another
before
kwannon
in
the
sanctuary
of
the
temple
our
second
meeting
was
in
the
midst
of
battle
and
slaughter
the
third
in
the
presence
of
your
highness
when
i
was
received
as
the
kinsman
of
owari
dono
and
as
a
of
the
first
class
the
fourth
in
her
garden
when
she
saved
me
from
the
treacherous
plot
of
my
enemies
is
yet
to
be
made
that
either
keiki
or
midzuano
knew
of
the
attack
you
have
yourself
stated
claim
that
he
was
confused
by
reason
of
the
great
terror
which
lay
upon
all
the
gate
watch
had
only
to
discover
your
presence
in
the
forbidden
enclosure
to
charge
upon
have
presented
the
facts
so
far
as
i
know
them
your
highness
what
i
now
wish
to
make
clear
is
how
fate
has
brought
together
myself
and
the
august
lady
twice
your
highness
called
upon
your
daughter
to
serve
the
guest
it
can
not
be
that
your
highness
failed
to
perceive
that
her
soul
shone
in
my
eyes
he
broke
in
far
less
presumption
men
have
been
sawn
asunder
crucified
burned
the
presumption
so
great
when
consideration
is
taken
of
the
honor
accorded
me
by
your
highness
as
the
acknowledged
peer
of
the
prince
of
owari
and
the
daimio
of
satsuma
barbarian
he
flung
at
me
highness
has
read
the
memorial
of
yoritomo
sama
i
replied
people
are
as
vastly
above
your
people
in
some
respects
as
your
people
are
above
mine
in
others
another
matter
who
may
say
whence
our
souls
come
and
whither
they
go
my
friend
yoritomo
contends
that
the
august
lady
and
i
must
have
loved
one
another
in
a
previous
incarnation
this
i
do
not
know
but
i
do
know
that
i
have
seen
my
soul
in
the
eyes
of
the
his
face
darkened
with
a
sudden
return
of
anger
but
his
voice
was
constrained
to
a
false
calmness
is
now
perceived
that
the
is
a
madman
permission
is
granted
him
to
highness
i
protested
happiness
of
the
princess
happiness
and
honor
will
be
safe
in
the
keeping
of
her
husband
she
shall
wed
keiki
the
son
of
i
cried
man
who
sought
to
disgrace
her
the
still
hold
to
that
lie
enough
his
punishment
will
be
considered
and
command
sent
in
due
go
there
was
no
hope
for
me
in
the
cold
menace
of
his
look
yet
i
did
not
give
way
to
any
outward
display
of
the
fear
and
despair
that
was
within
me
sustained
by
the
pride
of
race
and
blood
i
forced
a
smile
and
kowtowed
and
withdrew
complying
with
the
most
punctilious
requirements
of
court
etiquette
chapter
xxv
not
until
i
stood
in
my
own
apartments
in
owari
yashiki
alone
with
yoritomo
did
i
give
way
to
the
tempest
within
my
soul
even
then
the
frailness
of
the
walls
compelled
me
to
speak
with
lowered
voice
but
my
rage
and
despair
vented
themselves
in
a
flood
of
bitter
complaint
never
had
i
seen
my
friend
so
concerned
yet
it
was
the
outcome
he
had
predicted
and
he
could
give
me
no
hope
grieve
for
you
worth
he
said
have
learned
the
truth
the
remotest
suggestion
of
your
desire
would
seem
madness
to
she
loves
me
daughters
of
and
shoguns
are
presumed
not
to
love
until
after
marriage
your
statement
to
him
that
she
loved
you
was
most
unfortunate
even
a
of
the
lowest
rank
would
consider
such
a
declaration
an
aspersion
upon
his
family
honor
had
it
not
been
for
that
me
tomo
i
have
played
into
the
hands
of
your
enemies
i
have
endangered
all
your
plans
the
tyrant
will
not
stop
at
punishing
me
he
will
wreak
his
anger
upon
those
who
have
harbored
the
hated
i
shall
leave
owari
yashiki
at
once
and
turn
taking
with
me
yuki
neither
of
us
shall
continue
to
bring
danger
upon
the
house
of
for
some
moments
he
sat
silent
regarding
me
with
a
smile
of
womanly
tenderness
when
he
replied
he
spoke
as
if
quoting
from
the
chinese
classics
better
is
death
in
the
consciousness
of
honor
than
a
grovelling
prosperity
the
laws
of
hospitality
are
sacred
they
may
not
be
violated
a
house
that
can
not
stand
upright
should
house
of
owari
bears
the
weight
of
the
contest
against
mito
i
argued
enemies
of
owari
seek
to
use
the
harboring
of
the
as
a
lever
to
overthrow
the
real
friends
of
is
of
no
avail
worth
he
said
sacrifice
would
result
in
no
good
if
we
are
not
strong
enough
to
shelter
you
we
are
not
strong
enough
to
resist
mito
the
matter
is
in
my
hands
not
yours
let
writing
materials
be
would
you
do
i
demanded
seized
with
a
premonition
of
his
purpose
he
smiled
almost
gayly
time
has
come
for
me
to
give
myself
for
the
success
of
my
i
cried
that
not
that
is
death
he
argued
passing
from
blind
form
to
unhampered
spirit
a
freeing
of
the
bonds
of
earthly
desire
other
and
higher
incarnations

him
who
has
sought
to
overcome
i
have
brought
you
to
this
fearful
thought
i
can
never
forgive
myself
have
nothing
to
forgive
worth
you
are
in
no
manner
responsible
for
what
i
am
about
to

that
was
determined
upon
by
me
before
i
so
much
as
saw
your
ship
in
kagoshima
bay
how
often
have
i
told
you
that
my
life
has
been
vowed
it
might
not
have
been
required
it
is
my
selfishness
that
is
forcing
you
to
this
dreadful
decision
at
the
best
i
am
a
condemned
man
it
is
my
right
to
do
what
little
i
can
to
free
the
house
of
owari
from
house
of
owari
stands
or
falls
in
honor
to
thrust
you
out
as
a
would
stain
that
honor
and
it
would
rightfully
be
considered
as
evidence
of
weakness

one
chance

only
one
to
check
the
intrigues

with
horror

a
they
will
call
my
service
a
have
been
received
by
iyeyoshi
as
the
equal
of
satsuma
i
have
no
other
friend
will
you
fail
me
in
my
need
god
i
cried
can
i
speak
only
of
friendship
i
will
not
urge
your
assent
on
the
ground
of
consideration
for
my
father
for
the
sake
of
dai
nippon
i
went
out
into
your
world
and
returned
to
die
you
chose
to
return
with
me
brother
will
you
now
forsake
me
in
my
need
suddenly
the
veil
of
horror
parted
before
me
and
i
saw
the
intended
sacrifice
with
the
eyes
of
my
friend
iyeyoshi
had
been
duped
by
the
wiles
of
the
reactionaries
the
mito
party
if
not
quickly
checkmated
would
turn
the
shogunate
against
all
progress
and
greet
the
american
expedition
upon
its
return
with
an
attack
no
less
vicious
than
futile
after
that
war
and
reprisals
bombardments
by
the
black
ships
rebellion
internecine
war
and
a
weakened
government
harsh
demands
by
the
domineering
powers
possibly
a
conquest
what
more
inspiring
than
the
thought
that
all
might
be
averted
by
the
giving
of
one
life
my
friend
was
about
to
offer
himself
as
a
willing
sacrifice
for
the
good
of
his
country
it
was
my
privilege
to
ease
the
ordeal
for
him
and
to
lend
an
added
dignity
to
the
ceremony
what
did
it
matter
if
my
occidental
prejudices
were
shocked
and
horrified
at
the
part
required
of
me
to
the
japanese
it
was
an
almost
sacred
duty
he
had
well
said
that
it
was
the
highest
service
a
man
could
render
a
friend
will
serve
you
tomo
i
gasped
he
sprang
up
beaming
is
no
time
to
lose
send
yuki
to
shinagawa
for
kohana
i
must
see
my
father
and
prepare
a
declaratory
testament
to
be
presented
to
the
shogun
fujimaro
will
make
all
the
necessary
arrangements
until
the
time
comes
brother
he
turned
to
go
but
i
sprang
before
him
to
grasp
his
hand
must
it
really
be
is
there
no
other
way
sorrow
is
my
sole
regret
he
replied
others
whom
i
love
will
rejoice
with
me
in
my
to
this
i
had
no
reply
he
gave
my
hand
a
responsive
grip
and
hastened
out
i
sank
down
overcome
with
a
wave
of
returning
grief
and
horror
but
he
had
said
there
was
need
for
haste
i
sat
up
and
clapped
sharply
for
fujimaro
and
yuki
they
entered
and
bowed
to
receive
my
urgent
commands
yuki
rushed
out
to
ride
posthaste
to
shinagawa
fujimaro
to
make
arrangements
for
the
ceremony
of
i
was
left
alone
with
my
anguish
twilight
approached
my
attendants
came
with
lamps
and
the
evening
meal
i
could
not
eat
and
i
dared
not
refresh
myself
with
there
was
need
for
me
to
retain
perfect
control
of
mind
and
body
i
could
do
nothing
but
suffer
and
wait
for
the
terrible
moment
hiding
my
pain
as
best
i
could
behind
a
mask
of
austerity
at
last
yuki
came
to
announce
his
return
with
kohana
san
i
ordered
the
brought
in
and
yoritomo
notified
as
the
girl
kowtowed
before
me
i
saw
by
her
pallor
that
she
had
been
told
yet
she
had
the
fortitude
to
smile
and
murmur
the
usual
complimentary
greetings
only
once
i
caught
her
gaze
and
read
in
her
agonized
eyes
the
grief
and
despair
which
etiquette
compelled
her
to
conceal
soon
yoritomo
entered
gravely
serene
yet
radiant
with
the
solemn
joy
of
his
final
testament
was
in
the
hands
of
his
father
all
was
now
in
readiness
for
him
to
undergo
the
ultimate
test
of
sincerity
when
he
seated
himself
beside
me
kohana
prostrated
herself
at
his
feet
he
regarded
her
with
the
tender
compassion
of
a
saint
for
a
suffering
child
is
of
blood
he
said
knows
that
death
is
a
small
servant
implores
the
honorable
joy
of
following
her
lord
she
murmured
service
is
asked
he
replied
whom
i
leave
behind
may
still
profit
by
the
craft
of
i
then
linger
she
sobbed
the
weakness
was
only
of
a
duration
she
looked
up
her
face
bright
with
the
same
glory
of
that
shone
in
the
serene
countenance
of
my
friend
will
of
my
lord
is
the
joy
of
his
servant
yuki
kowtowed
to
me
and
whispered
lord
now
is
our
time
for
i
rose
and
followed
him
to
the
bath
leaving
yoritomo
and
his
beloved
to
say
their
farewells
alone
when
we
returned
purified
by
the
water
and
attired
in
ceremonial
costume
of
trousers
and
hempen
winged
jackets
i
found
my
visitors
gone
in
their
place
fujimaro
waited
to
hand
me
my
sword
the
time
had
almost
come
to
make
certain
of
my
part
i
asked
a
number
of
questions
and
agreed
upon
a
signal
from
yuki
fujimaro
then
led
us
to
the
wing
of
the
palace
in
which
a
chamber
had
been
set
apart
for
the
ceremony
in
the
centre
of
the
room
the
mats
were
covered
with
a
spread
of
white
silk
upon
which
in
turn
were
laid
two
red
quilts
at
each
corner
of
the
quilts
stood
a
single
whitewood
candlestick
with
its
taper
the
only
other
lights
in
the
room
were
two
candles
beside
a
pair
of
seats
five
or
six
paces
distant
from
the
quilts
chancing
to
glance
behind
a
set
of
white
folding
screens
that
stood
across
from
the
seats
i
saw
my
dirk
lying
upon
a
tray
of
unvarnished
cypress
wood
there
were
other
objects
beside
the
tray
i
looked
hastily
away
having
assured
ourselves
that
all
was
in
readiness
yuki
and
i
went
out
into
a
side
room
and
waited
we
heard
soft
footsteps
in
the
chamber
after
a
few
minutes
yoritomo
came
down
a
corridor
accompanied
by
several
chamberlains
he
had
already
taken
leave
of
his
father
and
mother
and
was
dressed
in
the
prescribed
ceremonial
costume
of
white
linen
kohana
had
gone
and
the
prince
did
not
appear
fujimaro
entered
and
together
with
the
other
chamberlains
kowtowed
while
yuki
and
i
conducted
our
principal
into
the
chamber
we
found
the
witnesses
to
the
ceremony
seated
upon
the
benches
great
as
was
my
anguish
i
thrilled
with
momentary
pleasure
when
i
recognized
ii
and
the
great
daimio
of
satsuma
not
even
mito
might
doubt
the
testimony
of
such
witnesses
yuki
kowtowed
yoritomo
and
i
bowed
low
and
the
rose
to
return
the
salute
the
resumed
their
seats
yoritomo
seated
himself
on
knees
and
heels
in
the
centre
of
the
quilts
facing
so
that
the
witnesses
were
before
him
on
his
left
i
took
up
my
position
behind
him
and
drew
his
sword
as
fujimaro
had
directed
me
yuki
brought
the
tray
with
the
dirk
from
behind
the
screen
and
knelt
to
present
it
yoritomo
bowed
to
the
loosened
his
robes
and
took
the
dirk
from
the
tray
yuki
kowtowed
in
a
position
that
enabled
him
to
watch
the
fatal
stroke
and
give
me
the
signal
yoritomo
tucked
the
ends
of
his
sleeves
under
his
knees
that
his
body
might
not
fall
backward
i
stood
in
my
place
rigid
with
horror
fortunately
i
could
not
see
his
face
or
the
frightful
stroke
that
at
least
i
was
spared
all
i
saw
was
the
dear
form
of
my
friend
bending
over
under
the
agony
to
fail
him
now
would
mean
a
prolongation
of
his
atrocious
pain
possibly
the
fearful
disgrace
of
an
outcry
yuki
signed
to
me
i
struck
never
had
i
aimed
a
truer
blow
the
next
i
knew
i
was
holding
my
sleeve
before
my
eyes
and
some
one
was
leading
me
from
the
chamber
of
death
chapter
xxvi
hovering
hawks
all
night
i
lay
tossing
in
the
anguish
of
my
grief
unable
to
sleep
and
forget
morning
found
me
distraught
and
fast
losing
my
senses
in
the
delirium
of
fever
when
i
reawakened
to
consciousness
i
found
myself
in
a
large
room
that
opened
upon
an
entrancing
view
of
the
gardens
there
had
been
a
heavy
rain
and
a
flood
of
morning
sun
rays
were
streaming
through
the
gray
clouds
to
scintillate
among
the
foliage
with
iridescent
splendors
this
i
believe
was
what
had
roused
me
i
turned
my
head
for
a
better
look
and
discovered
that
i
was
strangely
weak
then
i
remembered
and
i
no
longer
saw
the
magic
glory
of
the
garden
i
groaned
and
sank
back
upon
my
silken
quilts
gentle
fingers
stroked
my
forehead
i
opened
my
eyes
and
gazed
up
into
the
soft
eyes
of
the
quaintly
beautiful
little
lady
tokiwa
his
mother
how
could
she
endure
the
sight
of
him
who
had
held
the
sword
again
i
groaned
and
closed
my
eyes
a
voice
murmured
a
prayer
for
me
to
give
heed
i
looked
up
and
saw
a
benevolent
old
man
with
huge
grotesque
eyes
he
bent
forward
tremulously
and
i
perceived
that
the
supposed
eyes
were
chinese
goggles
he
kowtowed
and
quivering
and
sweating
with
fear
offered
me
a
bowl
of
medicine
i
took
a
sip
of
the
nauseating
draught
and
thrust
the
bowl
from
me
in
violent
loathing
the
physician
drew
back
before
my
angry
gesture
gray
with
fear
is
required
that
the
august
lord
should
receive
treatment
he
murmured
is
my
mind
not
my
body
that
is
sick
i
rejoined
he
crept
away
in
trembling
obedience
the
princess
tokiwa
bent
over
me
to
stroke
my
forehead
with
her
soothing
fingers
i
shrank
from
her
touch
and
threw
my
arm
across
my
eyes
lady
i
cried
can
you
bear
to
come
near
the
forgive
me
she
asked
in
evident
wonderment
forgiveness
but
gratitude
is
due
the
august
lord
the
house
of
owari
is
the
debtor
of
woroto
i
stared
at
her
incredulously
was
it
possible
that
even
she
could
feel
gratitude
towards
the
man
who
had
held
the
sword
she
was
his
mother
yet
i
could
not
mistake
the
expression
of
her
gentle
face
it
is
not
alone
the
men
of
nobility
who
are
bred
there
was
profound
grief
in
the
depths
of
her
dark
eyes
but
it
was
a
grief
crowned
with
the
glory
of
her
heroic
martyrdom
and
in
her
sight
i
was
illumined
by
the
reflection
of
his
glory
in
the
realization
of
that
fact
my
conscience
was
appeased
the
terrible
feeling
of
passed
from
me
and
i
was
healed
lady
i
whispered
customs
of
the
world
are
far
different
from
the
customs
of

according
to
his
wish

made

beamed
upon
me
with
a
radiant
smile
utterly
unconscious
of
my
real
meaning
not

a
kinsman
of
owari
she
murmured
he
came
from
beyond
the
seas
he
has
proved
that
he

no
longer
will
the
clan
of
owari
think
of
him

i

now
japanese
the
country
of
my
brother
yoritomo

now
my
country
and
his
mission
is
my
i
sat
up
my
strength
returns
at
the
very
thought
let
yuki
be
sent
to
me
he
and
i
have
alike
incurred
the
displeasure
of
the
shogun
we
will
become
the
august
lord
angered
that
he
would
shame
the
hospitality
of
owari
she
protested
have
brought
danger
upon
the
family
of
my
friend
and
kinsman
was
my
answer
she
rose
and
glided
from
the
room
i
turned
to
creep
to
a
rack
upon
which
my
clothes
were
hanging
but
when
i
began
dressing
myself
i
found
that
i
could
hardly
stand
trailing
my
girdle
behind
me
i
tottered
back
to
my
bed
and
sank
down
upon
it
before
i
could
recover
sufficient
energy
to
finish
my
dressing
the
prince
entered
and
seated
himself
close
beside
me
when
we
had
exchanged
salutes
he
regarded
me
gravely
and
asked
my
guest
been
affronted
that
he
should
wish
to
leave
my
roof
presence
of
the
threatens
the
house
of
owari
with
iyeyoshi
command
the
punishment
of
my
guest
i
must
submit
otherwise
i
would
sooner
cast
out
my
grandson
than
permit
my
guest
to
go
from
my
gate
a
is
my
life
against
the
winning
of
that
for
which
a
far
more
precious
life
has
been
given
honor
of
owari
forbids
he
replied
in
a
tone
of
finality
that
checked
all
further
protest
his
manner
softened
to
the
familiarity
of
a
father
addressing
a
son
may
not
be
aware
of
the
time
that
has
elapsed
since
he
fell
sick
the
last
writing
of
one
who
has
gone
from
us
has
been
presented
to
the
shogun
and
the
witnesses
have
given
their
evidence
of
the
proof
of
sincerity
the
welfare
of
his
friend
and
kinsman
was
not
forgotten
by
the
mentioned
me
in
so
solemn
a
document
i
exclaimed
fate
and
the
fate
of
nippon
together
await
the
decision
of
iyeyoshi
is
the
funeral
after
that
i
go
to
the
i
murmured
i
lain
here
so
long
have
been
no
delays
he
answered
will
wish
to
accompany
the
cortege
to
uyeno
you
must
now
eat
and
sleep
that
your
strength
may
he
withdrew
and
presently
tokiwa
sama
entered
bearing
a
tray
of
nourishing
food
prepared
by
her
own
hands
i
ate
and
sank
into
a
refreshing
sleep
at
nightfall
she
roused
me
for
a
second
meal
and
after
a
time
i
again
fell
asleep
at
dawn
i
wakened
hungry
and
much
restored
in
strength
fujimaro
appeared
to
conduct
me
to
my
bath
from
which
i
returned
to
find
a
dainty
breakfast
that
had
been
sent
by
tokiwa
sama
while
i
was
eating
yuki
came
in
from
a
night
trip
to
shinagawa
he
had
made
it
on
the
pretence
of
a
carousal
but
in
reality
to
spy
upon
the
mito
and
to
ascertain
whether
all
was
well
with
kohana
the
girl
had
returned
home
the
night
of
death
yuki
learned
that
her
visit
had
been
made
without
detection
by
our
enemies
not
only
was
she
safe
she
had
gained
some
information
yuki
brought
from
her
a
message
of
warning
which
fujimaro
read
for
me
way
of
the
departed
winds
past
the
eyrie
of
falcons
the
seabird
should
keep
to
his
superior
mito
yashiki
lies
on
the
road
to
uyeno
explained
yuki
would
not
dare
to
desecrate
the
funeral
cortege
by
an
attack
i
exclaimed
mito
does
not
dare
is
yet
to
be
seen
my
lord
and
his
escort
will
wear
steel
within
their
linen
robes
said
yuki
and
he
hastened
out
to
fetch
me
a
mail
cuirass
and
a
helmet
while
fujimaro
brought
me
a
mourning
costume
of
white
linen
leaving
me
to
the
chamberlain
yuki
withdrew
to
prepare
himself
and
my
retinue
against
treacherous
attack
i
was
dressed
and
conducted
by
fujimaro
to
a
room
in
which
i
had
often
honored
the
ancestors
of
owari
by
bowing
to
the
shinto
but
the
shelf
and
its
tablets
were
now
hidden
by
a
curtain
of
white
paper
we
passed
on
into
the
chamber
where
the
dead
lay
before
the
lighted
candles
of
the
buddhist
family
shrine
neither
the
prince
nor
the
princess
were
present
i
was
received
by
the
chief
mourner
a
grave
and
boy
of
twelve
the
son
of
elder
brother
i
had
expected
to
see
the
square
coffin
or
great
red
urn
in
which
as
a
rule
persons
of
noble
rank
are
buried
but
my
friend
was
recumbent
in
a
long
lacquered
case
the
head
of
which
was
placed
to
the
north
a
napkin
lay
across
his
neck
the
serene
smile
on
the
face
was
so
characteristic
that
i
could
have
fancied
he
was
asleep
had
it
not
been
for
the
vermilion
with
which
the
coffin
was
in
great
part
filled
the
chamber
was
crowded
with
friends
and
relatives
of
the
family
but
i
saw
none
of
them
i
looked
at
my
dearest
friend
and
drew
back
to
kneel
among
the
other
mourners
my
eyes
dim
with
the
starting
tears
my
arrival
had
been
late
a
buddhist
priest
with
a
little
bell
entered
after
a
brief
ceremony
came
in
to
bear
out
the
corpse
none
other
than
a
pariah
might
touch
the
dead
all
passed
out
into
the
open
and
formed
the
funeral
cortege
led
by
the
priest
with
his
bell
and
next
a
boy
carrying
the
or
memorial
tablet
of
the
deceased
all
the
men
followed
with
the
chief
mourner
bearing
flowers
and
symbolic
banners
the
coffin
was
borne
after
us
on
the
shoulders
of
the
in
the
reversed
position
of
a
last
of
all
came
the
women
mourners
the
procession
was
very
long
before
the
rear
left
owari
yashiki
the
van
was
far
outstretched
on
the
causeway
that
led
along
the
bank
of
the
outer
moat
towards
mito
yashiki
slowly
and
solemnly
we
paced
along
the
deserted
roadway
beside
the
still
waters
in
which
marvellous
lotus
blossoms
reared
aloft
their
great
pads
a
mile
brought
us
to
the
bridge
across
the
yodogawa
where
it
flows
into
the
moat
the
causeway
now
turned
with
the
moat
from
northeast
to
east
and
skirted
the
long
walls
of
mito
yashiki
yuki
and
his
men
pressed
up
close
beside
me
and
grasped
their
swords
within
the
white
robes
but
the
seemed
as
deserted
as
was
the
street
before
the
funeral
cortege
of
the
son
of
owari
not
a
face
appeared
at
one
of
all
the
long
row
of
grated
windows
the
great
gates
were
closed
and
no
warder
peered
from
the
window
we
passed
by
in
a
solemn
silence
broken
only
by
the
tinkle
of
the
bell
and
the
scuffle
of
heavy
sandals
the
mito
men
had
respected
the
dead
not
i
surmised
through
any
desire
to
honor
owari
but
because
an
attack
on
the
cortege
would
have
been
considered
little
less
than
sacrilegious
by
the
other
clans
with
no
thought
of
danger
to
divert
me
from
grief
the
long
march
on
to
uyeno
seemed
to
drag
out
to
dreary
infinity
yet
at
last
we
passed
up
the
wide
hirokoji
street
and
through
the
black
gate
of
uyeno
park
and
mortuary
chapels
and
monasteries
were
not
unlike
those
of
shiba
and
the
great
temple
of
hardly
less
grand
than
zozoji
but
i
had
no
heart
for
such
wonders
as
the
vast
stone
lantern
and
vaster
bronze
buddha
the
image
of
kwannon
and
the
beautiful
paintings
arabesques
and
sculptures
of
gates
and
ceilings
the
tombs
and
temples
of
shoguns
were
nothing
to
me
i
was
looking
upon
the
coffin
of
my
friend
when
the
gorgeously
robed
priests
had
ended
their
chanted
ritual
i
rose
in
turn
with
the
other
mourners
to
bow
before
the
coffin
and
lay
incense
upon
the
smoking
censer
and
withdraw
to
my
place
when
all
had
taken
the
last
farewell
the
bore
him
into
the
tomb
lord
murmured
yuki
is
ill
advised
for
us
to
linger
we
should
return
without
delay
to
the
outer
moat
and
cross
over
through
the
official
quarter
to
repass
mito
yashiki
would
be
to
incur
great
i
demanded
we
to
skulk
from
our
enemies
on
our
return
from
funeral
let
others
do
as
they
choose
we
return
as
we
his
eyes
flashed
with
martial
fire
lord
speaks
as
a
true
his
attendants
will
go
with
him
hawks
poise
do
not
go
my
lord
whispered
a
voice
behind
me
i
exclaimed
and
i
turned
about
swiftly
i
saw
her
slender
figure
gliding
in
amongst
a
group
of
the
women
mourners
in
a
moment
i
had
lost
sight
of
her
yuki
sprang
to
overtake
her
but
i
stopped
him
with
a
gesture
i
said
the
hawks
swoop
they
will
find
heron
beaks
awaiting
fifty
men
all
under
their
white
robes
followed
me
out
through
the
black
gate
and
down
hirokoji
street
our
sandals
were
bound
on
tight
and
we
swung
along
at
a
brisk
road
pace
that
promised
to
carry
us
past
mito
yashiki
a
good
before
sundown
we
had
no
wish
either
to
slip
by
unseen
or
to
be
ambushed
in
the
dark
the
quickness
of
our
return
did
not
take
the
mito
men
by
surprise
they
had
watchmen
in
a
tower
at
the
corner
of
the
who
signalled
our
approach
when
we
came
opposite
the
great
gate
it
was
open
and
keiki
stood
in
the
entrance
with
a
band
of
mito
and
hitotsubashi
retainers
all
in
full
armor
keiki
shone
resplendent
in
a
grotesque
harness
of
green
and
red
and
gold
that
gave
him
the
appearance
of
an
insect
his
helmet
closed
across
his
face
in
a
hideous
mask
swordbearer
clanked
out
into
the
roadway
to
intercept
us
his
mail
apron
lending
to
his
gait
a
ludicrous
appearance
of
waddling
but
there
was
nothing
ludicrous
in
his
purpose
yuki
sprang
before
me
and
exchanged
a
formal
bow
with
the
challenger
a
moment
later
their
swords
flashed
out
yuki
was
the
first
swordsman
of
yedo
but
his
opponent
was
a
close
second
for
a
long
two
minutes
their
swords
clashed
in
terrific
blows
stroke
upon
stroke
with
lightning
swiftness
one
of
the
of
the
challenger
fell
clanging
on
the
hard
ground
shorn
off
by
blade
in
turn
mail
barely
saved
him
from
a
blow
had
he
worn
no
armor
he
must
have
been
killed
by
that
master
cut
twice
they
wounded
one
another
with
frightful
slashes
that
shore
through
brass
and
steel
and
silk
wadding
to
the
flesh
yet
each
time
failed
to
maim
or
kill
the
crest
of
the
helmet
was
a
ornament
at
the
height
of
the
combat
the
man
stooped
forward
with
the
force
of
a
supreme
stroke
yuki
glanced
the
whistling
blade
and
struck
back
a
tremendous
downward
blow
that
split
the
pear
in
half
and
cleft
down
through
the
helmet
the
challenger
fell
as
if
struck
by
a
thunderbolt
my
men
raised
a
jeering
shout
but
keiki
advanced
alone
and
they
fell
silent
again
the
young
lord
strutted
out
within
a
few
paces
of
me
and
called
tauntingly
the
barbarian
consider
the
day
for
hitotsubashi
if
so
let
him
take
the
place
of
his
is
a
saying
that
meets
the
situation
i
replied
is
to
the
effect
that
any
cur
may
be
expected
to
yap
before
his
own
kennel
mito
yashiki
swarms
with
retainers
ready
to
pour
out
and
overwhelm
my
small
band
keiki
and
his
followers
are
in
full
armor
i
refuse
to
be
tricked
if
i
draw
sword
it
means
death
to
me
whether
or
not
keiki
dies
first
such
being
the
scheme
i
will
even
the
odds
in
this
i
drew
both
my
revolvers
life
of
keiki
is
in
my
hand
he
will
do
well
to
let
the
mourners
of
yoritomo
sama
pass
in
the
uplifting
muzzles
of
my
heavy
pistols
were
arguments
to
convince
the
most
sceptical
he
drew
back
three
or
four
paces
i
signed
to
my
men
to
march
on
but
yuki
waited
beside
me
when
the
rear
had
passed
we
turned
our
backs
upon
keiki
and
swung
away
after
the
others
keiki
and
his
men
watched
us
go
without
uttering
a
word
or
attempting
a
single
hostile
movement
though
the
champion
of
mito
lay
outstretched
in
the
public
highway
and
his
blood
called
for
vengeance
upon
owari
hawks
have
darted
upon
the
heron
beaks
and
swooped
back
to
their
eyrie
i
exclaimed
are
not
seriously
hurt
yuki
yet
my
yet
he
glanced
up
at
the
high
barred
windows
of
the
from
which
helmeted
heads
were
peering
down
upon
us
i
looked
back
at
the
gate
keiki
and
his
men
were
withdrawing
into
the
there
was
something
ominous
in
their
quick
retreat
and
in
the
silence
of
the
retainers
at
the
windows
i
called
upon
the
men
to
hasten
they
swung
into
a
half
trot
a
barbed
arrow
whistled
past
my
cheek
and
across
shoulder
another
struck
my
breast
and
fell
blunted
from
my
mail
yuki
sprang
to
my
right
side
with
upraised
sword
he
shouted
long
hawks
swoop
he
clipped
a
whirring
shaft
in
with
a
dexterous
stroke
and
dragged
me
forward
into
the
midst
of
the
men
a
storm
of
arrows
burst
upon
us
streaming
down
through
the
barred
windows
we
broke
into
headlong
flight
beyond
the
farther
corner
of
the
was
safety
and
the
distance
was
not
great
but
the
barbed
shafts
flew
thick
and
fast
had
it
not
been
for
our
armor
i
doubt
if
a
single
one
of
us
would
have
won
through
a
man
beside
me
plunged
backward
struck
through
the
throat
i
would
have
paused
but
yuki
dragged
me
onward
the
man
was
dead
we
too
would
be
slain
if
we
lingered
more
than
once
yuki
clipped
in
the
air
arrows
that
might
have
pierced
between
my
steel
collar
and
helmet
other
arrows
bruised
my
flesh
through
steel
and
padding
i
was
the
central
object
of
the
cowardly
attack
the
tempered
steel
of
my
armor
alone
saved
me
from
death
another
of
my
men
fell
dead
and
several
were
wounded
by
shafts
many
of
which
were
intended
for
myself
we
rushed
on
up
the
road
each
wounded
man
between
two
of
his
fellows
we
passed
the
corner
of
the
the
deadly
shower
was
slackening
a
arrow
pierced
my
upper
left
arm
from
the
rear
yuki
sprang
behind
to
shield
me
with
his
body
but
it
was
the
last
shot
as
a
little
farther
on
we
checked
our
flight
yuki
said
with
grim
humor
lord
now
knows
what
hawks
were
meant
by
kohana
they
have
made
us
pay
two
men
for
one
it
was
well
the
mito
men
did
not
think
sooner
of
the
arrows
else
my
lord
would
have
been
without
pausing
in
his
stride
he
snapped
the
arrow
that
had
passed
half
through
my
arm
and
drew
the
end
from
the
wound
and
a
minute
later
it
was
tightly
bandaged
the
other
wounded
men
received
the
same
rough
efficient
surgery
but
one
died
in
the
very
gateway
of
owari
yashiki
chapter
xxvii
son
by
adoption
dawn
of
the
following
day
found
the
prince
of
owari
at
the
palace
to
make
complaint
against
the
dastardly
attack
of
the
mito
men
he
returned
shortly
after
noon
and
within
the
hour
sent
word
that
he
would
come
to
see
me
in
my
apartments
fujimaro
who
brought
the
message
knew
nothing
as
to
the
result
of
the
visit
to
the
shogun
the
mingled
dread
and
hope
with
which
i
awaited
the
prince
may
well
be
imagined
was
i
to
be
sentenced
to
a
horrible
death
or
merely
sent
out
of
the
country
had
sacrifice
won
against
suspicion
and
reaction
or
were
owari
and
the
cause
of
progress
to
go
down
to
ruin
and
destruction
with
myself
since
i
had
lost
my
little
princess
i
could
think
of
my
own
fate
with
a
degree
of
indifference
but
that
the
cause
for
which
my
dear
friend
had
given
his
life
should
fail
what
bitterness
the
prince
entered
with
austere
stateliness
only
to
drop
from
the
formal
to
the
familiar
at
the
first
view
of
my
bandaged
arm
he
waved
all
our
attendants
to
leave
and
sank
down
beside
me
with
a
look
of
kindly
concern
are
in
pain
your
arm
did
yuki
say
whether
the
arrow
had
a
poisoned
head
no
my
lord
the
wound
is
already
healing
i
feel
no
pain
from
that
the
shogun
tell
me
does
the
house
of
owari
still
stand
unshaken
firmly
as
the
schemes
of
mito
he
smiled
and
stroked
his
slender
white
beard
continues
to
dwell
in
his
inferior
yashiki
keiki
has
paid
a
heavy
price
for
the
pierced
arm
of
my
guest
an
attack
with
deadly
weapons
within
the
bounds
of
yedo
is
an
outrage
upon
the
dignity
of
the
highness
once
more
inclines
to
your
counsel
offering
of
him
who
has
gone
from
us
has
not
been
without
avail
and
false
move
has
forced
the
last
bar
of
the
gate
for
us
your
offence
is
is
small
matter
has
there
been
an
acceptance
of
policies
memorialized
by
the
departed
have
yet
to
present
their
answers
to
the
letters
of
inquiry
sent
out
by
the
shogunate
the
majority
may
be
against
intercourse
with
the
peoples
yet
satsuma
and
ii
have
joined
me
in
urging
a
temporary
treaty
for
the
opening
of
a
few
ports
when
all
answers
have
been
received
his
highness
will
command
the
council
of
elders
to
announce
the
acceptance
of
our
i
cried
intercourse
be
established
for
a
time
and
even
the
frogs
in
the
well
will
be
compelled
to
see
talk
of
a
temporary
treaty
is
a
compromise
to
bring
over
those
who
waver
between
the
two
camps
i
have
talked
too
much
with
you
and
with
him
who
has
gone
to
doubt
now
that
ports
once
opened
will
ever
be
he
looked
at
me
with
a
quizzical
smile
a
enters
it
is
difficult
to
be
rid
of
say
i
am
forgiven
way
has
been
suggested
to
rid
the
land
from
the
that
is
to
make
him
not
a
a
you
mean
death
to
kin
and
country
i
recalled
to
the
shogun
the
precedent
of
the
wise
anjin
can
i
also
become
a
japanese
you
wed
a
japanese
i
can
not
do
that
you
know
there
is
only
one
maiden
in
all
japan
in
all
the
world
is
true
that
the
maiden
to
whom
you
refer
can
not
be
given
to
any
other
than
one
of
exalted
i
can
wed
none
heart
of
iyeyoshi
has
been
troubled
he
questioned
the
maiden
and
found
that
the
words
of
the
were
true
yet
how
could
the
shogun
give
his
daughter
to
a
i
stared
at
the
prince
aflame
with
an
ardent
hope
that
overpowered
me
you
say
that
he
speak
heir
of
owari
is
a
fitting
husband
for
the
daughter
of
the
shogun
you
know
the
arrangement
regarding
him
who
has
gone
from
us
there
now
remains
only
the
son
of
his
elder
brother
i
have
long
since
reached
the
age
when
it
is
customary
to
lay
aside
the
burden
of
the
title
and
of
the
clan
administration
the
boy
is
too
young
in
such
cases
it
is
not
unusual
to
adopt
an
elder
son
to
bear
the
burden
of
the
title
until
such
time
as
it
is
thought
best
for
him
to
retire
in
favor
of
the
younger
lord
i
gasped
can
not
mean
heart
is
touched
by
the
grief
of
his
daughter
he
is
willing
to
do
so
much
to
assure
her
happiness
my
kinsman
guest
has
a
true
heart
he
is
to
be
trusted
when
an
heir
succeeds
during
the
lifetime
of
his
father
he
bends
to
the
guidance
of
the
retired
there
is
no
more
to
be
said
the
decision
is
now
with
i
kowtowed
to
him
for
several
moments
i
could
not
speak
for
i
was
utterly
overcome
with
the
great
joy
and
unable
to
believe
that
such
good
fortune
could
be
mine
the
serene
face
of
yoritomo
appeared
before
my
mental
vision
it
was
as
if
he
had
returned
to
serve
me
as
guardian
spirit
of
my
brother
my
father
i
murmured
i
could
say
no
more
my
son
i
looked
up
and
saw
his
haughty
eyes
glistening
with
tears
we
gazed
deep
into
one
souls
my
brother
had
gone
from
me
but
i
had
found
a
father
he
rose
and
left
me
soon
however
the
screens
parted
to
admit
that
sweetest
and
quaintest
and
dearest
of
dames
tokiwa
sama
she
glided
across
to
kowtow
to
me
demurely
radiant
i
had
found
not
only
a
father
but
a
mother
and
such
a
mother
could
i
but
have
gathered
her
up
in
my
arms
and
poured
out
my
heart
to
her
instead
we
talked
with
decorous
restraint
of
various
little
details
of
home
life
matters
trifling
and
altogether
inconsequential
in
themselves
yet
charged
with
a
world
of
meaning
to
me
i
was
received
into
the
intimacy
of
the
home
life
i
had
become
a
member
of
the
family
never
had
i
chafed
more
at
the
convention
that
forbade
all
reference
to
romantic
love
freed
from
that
taboo
pronounced
by
an
etiquette
i
knew
my
dainty
little
adopted
mother
would
have
been
an
ideal
confidante
her
dear
face
glowed
with
sympathy
and
love
which
being
unable
to
express
in
words
or
caresses
she
could
convey
to
me
only
by
looks
and
the
exquisite
courtesy
of
her
manner
so
it
was
i
was
accepted
as
the
son
and
heir
of
owari
in
the
hearts
of
my
second
parents
before
my
adoption
according
to
the
forms
of
the
law
the
legal
adoption
was
not
a
simple
affair
of
routine
as
i
had
fancied
though
proposed
by
the
shogun
himself
it
was
blocked
for
some
weeks
by
the
intrigues
of
the
mito
party
and
the
opposition
of
the
elder
council
unaware
of
the
motive
behind
the
supposed
caprice
a
motive
that
made
resistance
futile
our
enemies
worked
zealously
to
prevent
the
acceptance
of
the
barbarian
as
heir
of
one
of
the
august
three
families
in
the
end
our
opponents
even
went
so
far
as
to
appeal
to
that
mysterious
superlord
the
mikado
for
this
act
custom
would
have
justified
iyeyoshi
in
punishing
them
with
utmost
severity
but
he
was
not
averse
to
showing
them
that
the
power
of
the
shogun
their
master
over
the
kyoto
court
was
unbroken
and
so
the
matter
was
delayed
for
some
weeks
in
ordinary
circumstances
the
dense
ignorance
and
bigotry
of
the
imperial
court
regarding
the
world
would
have
insured
a
certain
verdict
against
me
but
the
shogun
brought
heavy
pressure
to
bear
it
was
a
difficult
matter
to
deny
the
express
desire
of
one
who
had
the
power
to
enforce
compliance
also
i
suspect
that
the
difficulty
was
glossed
over
by
a
flat
denial
of
my
blood
and
a
strong
insistence
upon
my
kinship
to
the
house
of
owari
pending
the
sanction
of
the
mikado
i
was
required
to
remain
within
the
bounds
of
the
but
it
was
a
confinement
far
from
irksome
in
view
of
the
extreme
sultriness
of
the
midsummer
weather
and
the
charm
of
the
gardens
yuki
however
roved
at
will
about
the
city
in
the
disguise
of
a
spying
upon
the
mito
men
soon
after
the
funeral
i
had
sent
him
to
shinagawa
with
a
message
for
kohana
san
but
the
had
not
been
seen
since
my
glimpse
of
her
at
uyeno
she
had
not
returned
to
her
home
and
was
not
to
be
found
our
first
thought
was
that
she
might
have
killed
herself
for
love
of
yoritomo
yet
this
seemed
improbable
when
we
recalled
to
mind
his
command
for
her
to
live
and
serve
those
whom
he
left
behind
at
last
during
the
solemn
festival
of
the
dead
which
was
celebrated
in
mid
august
yuki
learned
that
the
girl
was
a
prisoner
in
hitotsubashi
yashiki
keiki
had
lured
her
into
his
palace
and
had
either
induced
or
forced
her
to
become
one
of
the
many
concubines
allowed
a
high
noble
by
custom
and
law
from
this
last
yuki
reasoned
that
keiki
could
not
possibly
have
discovered
her
devotion
to
our
cause
else
she
would
surely
have
been
tortured
instead
of
being
honored
with
the
rank
of
concubine
when
i
expressed
my
surprise
that
her
love
for
yoritomo
had
not
caused
her
to
commit
yuki
was
no
less
surprised
that
i
had
failed
to
grasp
her
motive
for
love
of
her
dead
lord
she
had
submitted
to
a
fate
that
to
her
was
worse
than
death
the
permission
of
my
lord
he
added
will
continue
to
haunt
the
vicinity
of
none
is
more
crafty
than
a
she
will
be
watching
for
an
opportunity
to
send
us
word
of
the
schemes
and
intrigues
of
the
mito
chapter
xxviii
high
treason
the
day
after
discovery
word
at
last
came
from
kyoto
sanctioning
the
prince
of
adoption
of
his
kinsman
as
son
and
heir
after
that
little
time
was
required
to
comply
with
law
and
custom
the
opposition
of
the
mito
faction
was
paralyzed
by
the
sanction
of
the
mikado
it
was
a
striking
instance
of
the
paradoxical
nature
of
the
government
of
this
strange
land
in
theory
the
mikado
was
the
sacred
and
absolute
emperor
and
the
shogun
only
the
first
among
his
secondary
class
of
nobles
in
fact
he
was
little
more
than
a
figurehead
in
the
hands
of
the
shogunate
and
his
sanction
of
government
measures
was
usually
given
as
a
matter
of
course
a
strong
shogun
such
as
iyeyoshi
could
even
enforce
compliance
against
the
wishes
of
so
powerful
an
opposition
as
the
mito
party
backed
by
the
reluctance
of
the
or
kyoto
nobles
yet
without
the
sanction
however
obtained
the
shogun
would
have
become
a
rebel
with
no
other
means
than
sheer
military
force
to
hold
in
subjection
the
great
one
may
well
imagine
the
chagrin
of
the
mito
faction
over
their
failure
to
block
my
official
adoption
as
the
heir
of
owari
and
their
fury
when
they
learned
of
the
retirement
in
my
favor
last
of
all
the
discovery
that
the
shogun
was
about
to
announce
his
decision
in
favor
of
a
temporary
treaty
with
the
hairy
barbarians
must
have
goaded
them
to
madness
the
final
ceremony
of
my
accession
to
the
title
and
position
of
prince
of
owari
was
an
audience
by
the
shogun
before
this
in
the
presence
of
the
counsellors
and
other
high
officials
of
the
clan
many
of
whom
had
journeyed
from
the
province
of
owari
for
the
occasion
my
adopted
father
had
abdicated
his
office
of
clan
chief
and
i
had
received
the
homage
of
the
the
day
appointed
for
my
formal
audience
was
august
the
though
surfeited
with
the
irksome
etiquette
and
honors
of
my
exalted
rank
i
looked
forward
to
the
audience
with
keenest
impatience
the
prince
as
i
shall
continue
to
call
him
had
assured
me
that
it
was
the
last
step
in
my
elevation
and
vastly
more
important
than
my
marriage
to
me
it
was
important
only
because
it
must
precede
my
marriage
as
a
necessary
result
of
the
ascent
that
brought
me
within
reach
of
my
silvery
moon
my
all
but
unattainable
princess
i
could
endure
and
even
welcome
the
austere
state
of
my
exalted
position
of
itself
however
there
was
no
relish
to
me
in
the
homage
of
my
clan
and
far
less
in
the
thought
of
rendering
homage
to
my
lord
the
shogun
my
princely
rank
was
a
ceremonial
which
bound
me
about
with
countless
rules
of
etiquette
and
restricted
my
every
act
and
word
to
certain
prescribed
forms
to
a
man
who
was
not
to
the
manner
born
the
result
was
little
short
of
torture
yet
i
would
gladly
have
endured
even
greater
discomfort
for
the
sake
of
winning
azai
the
vision
of
her
pure
and
lovely
face
was
before
my
eyes
night
and
day
it
sustained
me
throughout
the
dreary
hours
of
ceremonies
and
appeared
beside
the
serene
face
of
yoritomo
when
i
made
the
required
offerings
and
prayers
before
the
memorial
tablets
of
the
family
shrines
at
last
the
day
appointed
for
my
audience
arrived
i
was
roused
long
before
dawn
and
my
little
lady
mother
herself
came
to
overlook
every
detail
of
my
costume
by
dawn
my
cortege
marching
with
all
the
solemn
parade
of
a
state
progress
had
crossed
the
official
quarter
to
the
sakaruda
gate
with
me
were
the
clan
counsellors
and
a
powerful
guard
of
retainers
in
full
armor
yuki
had
reported
too
fully
upon
the
virulent
wrath
of
the
mito
men
for
us
to
chance
an
attack
unprepared
but
yuki
was
not
with
me
though
i
had
chosen
him
to
lead
my
escort
i
was
concerned
for
his
safety
for
he
had
gone
out
on
another
of
his
spying
ventures
and
had
not
returned
when
expected
at
the
sakaruda
gate
those
of
my
escort
who
wore
armor
remained
outside
the
citadel
i
was
carried
through
in
my
accompanied
by
my
counsellors
and
chamberlains
my
standard
bearers
and
other
ceremonial
attendants
with
and
paraphernalia
but
when
we
arrived
before
the
gejo
gate
the
state
entrance
to
the
inner
castle
i
was
required
to
leave
my
and
cross
the
bridge
of
the
inner
moat
afoot
escorted
only
by
a
few
of
my
highest
retainers
the
abbot
of
zozoji
who
was
a
prince
of
the
family
alone
could
ride
in
through
the
gejo
gate
that
honor
was
denied
even
the
heads
of
the
august
three
families
the
highest
of
all
the
within
the
gate
i
crossed
a
court
to
the
grand
portico
of
the
palace
where
i
was
met
by
gengo
and
another
of
the
court
chamberlains
even
my
counsellors
kowtowed
to
these
servants
of
the
shogun
who
in
turn
kowtowed
to
me
trailing
their
court
trousers
behind
them
they
conducted
me
to
a
where
i
was
served
with
powdered
tea
gruel
and
attired
in
court
hat
jacket
and
court
trousers
of
yellow
silk
after
the
refreshment
i
left
my
attendants
and
was
conducted
by
gengo
and
his
fellow
chamberlain
along
a
hall
lined
with
kowtowing
retainers
and
past
an
anteroom
in
which
five
or
six
score
of
the
lower
rank
knelt
in
profound
silence
shortly
beyond
we
came
to
the
raised
threshold
of
the
audience
hall
my
ushers
kowtowed
and
crept
in
on
hands
and
knees
i
followed
in
the
same
abject
posture
it
was
the
custom
of
the
country
and
the
price
i
must
pay
for
azai
the
throne
was
a
square
lacquered
stool
placed
upon
a
dais
two
feet
high
though
the
shogun
was
dressed
with
no
more
richness
than
on
the
occasions
of
my
informal
audiences
the
stateliness
of
his
appearance
was
vastly
increased
by
this
simple
throne
and
the
mat
curtain
that
hung
down
before
him
to
the
level
of
his
hat
on
his
left
three
or
four
yards
down
the
room
kowtowed
midzuano
and
the
other
members
of
the
elder
council
behind
the
dais
a
number
of
knelt
with
their
hands
upon
their
swordhilts
as
if
in
the
act
of
springing
up
to
attack
me
at
the
prescribed
distance
from
the
throne
my
ushers
parted
for
me
to
creep
forward
between
them
and
kowtow
in
homage
to
my
lord
the
hush
was
oppressive
i
waited
prostrate
until
a
faint
sibilation
from
the
courtiers
told
me
that
the
shogun
had
given
the
signal
for
my
withdrawal
my
audience
was
at
an
end
without
raising
my
head
i
crept
around
and
out
the
way
i
had
come
in
the
wake
of
my
abject
ushers
upon
my
return
to
the
i
was
served
a
banquet
of
nearly
a
hundred
dishes
i
could
do
no
more
than
taste
my
favorite
dish
of
each
course
after
which
all
were
set
aside
by
the
attendants
to
be
taken
to
owari
yashiki
an
hour
passed
and
my
solitary
feast
was
fairly
under
way
when
gengo
entered
and
bowed
before
me
with
a
flask
of
held
above
his
forehead
the
tycoon
to
the
prince
of
owari
he
murmured
i
kowtowed
thanks
are
offered
for
the
gift
of
the
august
ruler
let
the
wine
be
is
the
wish
of
his
highness
that
the
prince
test
the
flavor
of
the
both
cold
and
hot
replied
the
chamberlain
as
he
handed
the
flask
to
an
attendant
i
bowed
assent
will
of
his
highness
is
the
pleasure
my
lord
called
a
voice
in
the
entrance
is
not
always
at
the
first
word
i
had
glanced
down
the
room
and
perceived
yuki
standing
erect
on
the
threshold
the
attendants
stared
about
at
him
no
less
astonished
than
myself
his
dress
was
disarranged
and
his
look
so
strange
that
at
first
i
thought
he
had
been
fujimaro
spoke
to
him
warningly
and
he
sank
down
to
kowtow
no
drunken
man
could
have
saluted
in
such
manner
the
truth
flashed
upon
me
i
commanded
bring
a
message
he
sprang
up
with
a
sharp
exclamation
the
fox
has
gone
i
looked
about
and
saw
that
gengo
had
disappeared
in
the
pause
when
all
eyes
were
fixed
upon
the
kneeling
yuki
the
chamberlain
had
glided
to
the
side
wall
and
slipped
out
yuki
came
swiftly
up
the
room
through
the
midst
of
the
palace
attendants
and
pointed
to
the
man
with
the
flask
of
not
open
the
flask
he
commanded
and
he
knelt
to
offer
me
a
tattered
crumpled
scroll
my
lord
to
the
shogun
demand
that
gengo
drink
this
i
bent
forward
to
whisper
a
question
suspect
poison
alone
for
my
lord
hasten
i
fear
the
worst
keiki
and
midzuano
gengo
the
tool
but
i
was
already
up
and
crossing
the
room
the
flask
i
commanded
me
to
the
shogun
i
must
see
the
shogun
at
once
some
of
the
attendants
murmured
protests
but
their
superior
had
caught
the
alarm
he
signed
to
the
man
with
the
flask
and
led
us
swiftly
out
into
the
corridor
and
up
it
past
the
audience
hall
the
shogun
had
retired
to
more
private
apartments
we
hastened
on
through
a
suite
of
rooms
suddenly
a
palace
guard
blocked
our
way
my
escort
whispered
to
him
excitedly
the
guard
stepped
aside
we
entered
an
anteroom
and
glided
hastily
across
through
the
midst
of
the
waiting
attendants
at
the
upper
wall
we
were
again
halted
while
my
request
for
an
immediate
audience
was
sent
in
to
the
shogun
i
waited
in
an
agony
of
suspense
one
moment
after
another
dragged
past
unable
to
endure
the
uncertainty
i
thrust
my
finger
through
the
screen
and
peered
in
the
official
to
whom
my
request
had
been
whispered
still
crouched
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
screen
waiting
for
the
signal
to
advance
i
stared
up
the
room
to
where
iyeyoshi
sat
at
ease
between
midzuano
and
the
daimio
of
satsuma
as
i
looked
gengo
glided
in
with
a
tea
bowl
upon
a
tray
and
knelt
to
present
the
drink
to
his
lord
the
suspicion
of
his
hideous
purpose
struck
me
dumb
with
horror
the
shogun
reached
out
and
lifted
the
bowl
from
the
tray
at
that
my
hands
spoke
for
my
stricken
tongue
i
flung
aside
the
screen
that
was
before
me
and
threw
out
my
arm
in
a
warning
gesture
iyeyoshi
paused
with
the
bowl
at
his
lips
and
stared
at
me
in
frowning
resentment
i
pointed
downward
the
shogun
glanced
from
me
to
the
cringing
figure
of
gengo
instantly
he
dashed
the
bowl
and
its
contents
into
the
face
of
the
chamberlain
no
man
of
blood
might
endure
such
an
insult
even
from
the
shogun
the
poisoner
flared
out
in
mad
fury
with
amazing
swiftness
he
drew
a
dirk
and
bounded
upon
iyeyoshi
the
shogun
flung
himself
to
one
side
but
gengo
struck
with
deadly
aim
his
dirk
plunged
down
through
the
base
of
the
neck
the
full
twelve
inches
of
the
blade
with
a
roar
of
fury
satsuma
leaped
up
to
catch
the
dying
man
and
interpose
his
own
body
for
the
second
stroke
but
gengo
was
already
springing
back
well
aware
that
the
one
blow
had
done
the
awful
deed
we
were
already
rushing
in
my
companions
shrieking
for
the
guards
midzuano
sat
as
if
turned
to
stone
gengo
dropped
down
almost
beside
the
counsellor
to
make
an
end
of
himself
the
murderer
was
bred
swiftly
as
i
rushed
forward
i
could
not
seize
him
in
time
to
stay
his
dirk
from
the
fatal
cross
stroke
he
sank
prostrate
on
his
face
groaning
illustration
gengo
struck
with
deadly
aim
from
all
sides
with
bared
swords
rushed
in
drawn
by
the
shrieks
for
help
as
i
knelt
with
satsuma
beside
our
dead
lord
midzuano
leaped
up
and
pointed
to
us
with
a
terrible
cry
the
shogun
is
slain
kill
the
traitors
an
hesitancy
and
we
should
have
been
hacked
in
pieces
by
the
upraised
swords
satsuma
sprang
to
his
feet
his
great
form
swelling
with
wrath
his
heavy
face
dark
with
menace
without
a
word
he
pointed
one
hand
at
the
dying
assassin
and
the
other
at
midzuano
commanded
the
chief
counsellor
and
his
dull
eyes
lighted
with
cold
malevolence
echoed
satsuma
still
pointing
the
glared
at
us
in
deadly
rage
yet
stood
motionless
checked
by
the
power
of
the
great
daimio
i
rose
beside
him
and
signed
to
the
attendant
with
the
flask
he
pointed
to
the
dying
chamberlain
and
called
loudly
lies
gengo
is
the
traitor
he
first
brought
this
flask
to
the
prince
of
owari
then
came
to
serve
the
shogun
his
highness
had
cause
to
suspect
poison
he
flung

disconcerted
by
such
consummate
assurance

audacity
before

to
utter

the

passed
through

out

but
though
he
went
unopposed
his
going
was
none

in

a
retreat
freed
from

at

i
nodded
farewell
and
darted
into
the
banquet
room
where
my
retainers
sat
in
decorous
quiet
keenly
alert
to
the
stir
and
commotion
that
desecrated
the
solemn
hush
of
the
palace
yet
all
unaware
of
its
terrible
cause
i
told
them
that
instigated
by
the
mito
faction
my
poisoner
had
wounded
the
shogun
a
deed
worthy
of
the
days
of
the
ashikaga
shoguns
silencing
their
horrified
outcries
with
a
gesture
i
gave
my
seal
to
yuki
and
commanded
him
to
ride
at
full
speed
to
owari
yashiki
and
bring
a
force
to
assist
me
in
the
blockade
of
residence
he
rushed
out
without
an
delay

i
followed
with
the
utmost
haste
that
my
princely
dignity
would
permit

intrigue
within
the
hour
satsuma
had
midzuano
trapped
in
his
and
i
was
closing
in
upon
keiki
the
mito
men
gathered
rapidly
with
the
evident
purpose
of
driving
us
off
or
cutting
their
way
through
to
their
hitotsubashi
allies
but
the
timely
arrival
of
yuki
with
a
thousand
owari
retainers
compelled
the
enemy
to
draw
back
for
reinforcements
before
these
could
come
up
the
rumor
of
the
attack
upon
the
shogun
had
spread
throughout
the
official
quarter
and
so
vast
a
number
of
loyal
swarmed
to
my
support
that
the
mito
men
barely
averted
destruction
by
a
quick
retreat
across
the
outer
moat
to
their
superior
yashiki
a
word
from
me
would
have
precipitated
an
attack
that
must
have
resulted
in
the
certain
destruction
of
keiki
but
yuki
and
my
counsellors
alike
advised
me
against
a
course
of
action
that
would
undoubtedly
result
in
a
conflagration
not
alone
of
fire
the
death
of
keiki
by
the
sword
would
be
the
signal
for
civil
war
even
the
prince
of
owari
had
no
right
to
punish
the
enemies
without
the
command
of
the
shogun
the
most
i
could
do
was
to
lay
siege
to
the
fortified
dwelling
of
the
plotter
that
no
message
might
pass
between
him
and
the
old
prince
his
father
all
through
the
day
we
waited
lined
up
about
the
and
backed
by
the
dense
throngs
of
and
loyal
that
came
and
went
yet
were
always
too
numerous
to
be
driven
back
by
a
sortie
of
the
hitotsubashi
men
or
scattered
before
an
attack
by
mito
retainers
wisely
kept
close
and
made
no
display
of
weapons
at
the
windows
my
men
were
held
by
my
command
but
there
were
times
when
an
arrow
or
even
a
gibe
would
have
stung
our
allies
to
an
instant
storming
of
the
stronghold
late
in
the
afternoon
my
adopted
father
sent
a
message
commending
my
actions
and
asking
me
to
hold
my
position
until
notified
by
iyesada
with
whom
he
was
advising
at
nightfall
we
lighted
bamboo
torches
and
vast
numbers
of
lanterns
that
neither
keiki
nor
any
messenger
might
escape
past
us
in
the
darkness
a
violent
storm
accompanied
by
a
deluge
of
rain
and
a
display
of
lightning
most
unusual
in
japan
swept
over
the
city
during
the
night
the
wind
at
one
time
blowing
a
full
gale
but
though
we
were
in
the
midst
of
the
typhoon
season
the
storm
failed
to
augment
to
hurricane
force
the
ardor
of
more
than
half
of
our
volunteer
allies
was
quenched
by
the
downpour
and
the
turmoil
of
the
elements
appalled
by
the
seeming
anger
of
the
gods
they
deserted
us
in
great
numbers
yet
enough
remained
for
the
watch
to
be
maintained
with
utmost
vigilance
throughout
storm
and
night
dawn
brought
us
a
clearing
sky
and
lulling
wind
at
sunrise
a
rumor
reached
us
that
midzuano
had
committed
an
hour
later
an
order
from
the
palace
signed
by
iyesada
and
countersigned
by
abe
commanded
me
to
withdraw
my
forces
uncertain
whether
to
obey
i
despatched
a
messenger
to
satsuma
for
instructions
before
the
man
could
return
my
adopted
father
came
to
me
in
his
and
directed
me
to
comply
with
command
once
again
old
mito
and
his
accomplices
had
escaped
the
penalty
of
treason
midzuano
had
destroyed
message
and
with
a
false
fidelity
in
the
very
face
of
death
had
left
a
testament
to
the
effect
that
he
committed
in
proof
of
his
own
innocence
and
the
loyalty
of
his
friends
with
consummate
adroitness
he
had
converted
what
would
have
been
taken
as
a
confession
of
guilt
into
a
shield
to
hide
his
shame
and
a
mask
for
the
crime
of
his
without
proof
positive
abe
who
had
already
been
appointed
to
the
office
of
the
dead
counsellor
was
of
too
cautious
a
temperament
to
proceed
to
extremes
to
assure
himself
a
majority
he
had
favored
a
reorganization
of
the
council
of
elders
otherwise
the
regime
of
iyesada
promised
better
opportunity
for
the
success
of
mito
than
had
the
iron
rule
of
iyeyoshi
the
father
had
been
a
strong
man
who
could
command
the
fear
and
respect
of
all
the
great
the
son
was
an
amiable
capricious
weakling
abe
though
astute
was
and
lacked
the
force
and
magnetism
of
a
leader
his
would
be
a
policy
of
expediency
such
were
the
bitter
comments
of
my
father
as
we
sat
in
owari
yashiki
breaking
our
fast
on
the
dainty
dishes
served
us
by
my
quaint
little
mother
divining
with
subtle
intuition
the
great
fear
that
troubled
her
son
tokiwa
sama
ventured
to
inquire
what
effect
the
murder
of
iyeyoshi
would
have
on
my
marriage
the
prince
confessed
his
inability
to
foresee
but
assured
me
that
he
would
make
every
effort
to
obtain
from
abe
and
iyesada
a
confirmation
of
the
agreement
with
this
he
left
us
and
returned
to
the
palace
to
find
keiki
already
in
conference
with
the
new
chief
counsellor
it
was
the
beginning
of
a
ceaseless
contest
of
influence
and
intrigue
between
owari
and
mito
sobered
by
the
fate
of
his
and
guided
no
doubt
by
the
crafty
counsel
of
his
imprisoned
father
keiki
restrained
his
fiery
temper
and
proved
himself
a
master
of
subtlety
with
every
move
he
expressed
a
heartfelt
desire
for
an
amicable
adjustment
of
differences
and
for
the
coalescence
of
all
parties
under
the
banner
of
the
shogunate
this
was
his
protestation
even
while
his
agents
were
intriguing
with
the
kyoto
court
nobles
to
prevent
the
formal
investiture
of
iyesada
with
the
title
and
office
of
shogun
meantime
he
had
the
audacity
to
demand
the
immediate
release
of
his
father
my
degradation
and
deportation
as
a
and
the
marriage
of
azai
to
himself
our
only
positive
proposition
was
that
the
ports
should
be
opened
for
temporary
intercourse
against
us
the
mito
faction
stirred
up
all
the
prejudices
fears
and
passions
of
the
proud
class
abe
assumed
a
judicial
attitude
and
did
all
that
lay
in
his
power
to
conciliate
the
contending
factions
to
please
mito
he
authorized
the
building
of
war
junks
the
drilling
of
an
army
and
the
casting
of
cannon
plans
for
forts
upon
the
shoals
opposite
shinagawa
were
rushed
to
completion

begun

that
required
persons
suspected
of

to
tread
upon
the
cross
held
the
question
of
releasing
old
mito
in
abeyance
and
intimated
that
with
regard
to
azai
he
rather
favored
me
above
keiki
but
would
make
no
decision
until
the
regular
investiture
of
iyesada
gave
the
new
shogun
the
prestige
of
the
mikadoic
sanction
the
last
of
the
answers
of
the
to
the
letters
of
inquiry
sent
out
by
iyeyoshi
were
now
coming
in
and
abe
compared
them
with
the
others
with
a
politic
inclination
towards
the
weightier
scale
yet
decision
was
difficult
the
vast
majority
of
the
counsellors
were
uncertain
and
confused
in
their
advice
against
a
seeming
weight
of
opinion
in
favor
of
the
ancient
laws
the
perplexed
premier
had
to
consider
the
demands
of
the
russian
admiral
pontiatine
just
received
from
nagasaki
the
not
improbable
event
of
a
visit
from
the
powerful
asiatic
fleet
of
the
british
and
the
future
but
certain
return
of
commodore
perry
the
inevitable
result
was
a
continuance
of
the
policy
of
compromise
the
mito
intrigues
at
kyoto
were
delaying
the
investiture
of
iyesada
to
secure
the
mikadoic
sanction
the
weak
chief
counsellor
promised
keiki
the
release
of
his
father
to
appease
our
party
for
this
concession
to
the
enemy
abe
pledged
his
personal
influence
in
favor
of
a
temporary
treaty
and
engaged
to
secure
the
assent
of
the
mikado
keiki
obtained
an
additional
concession
that
old
rekko
should
be
placed
in

defences
of
yedo
when
the
prince
heard
of
this
last
victory
of

he
went
to
the
palace
in
a
rage
abe
was
most
apologetic
but
insisted
that
the
concession
had
been
pledged
under
the
seal
of
iyesada
and
could
not
be
withdrawn
as
a
peace
offering
he
agreed
to
obtain

marriage
with

chapter
xxx
my
wedding
eve
when
the
prince
returned
with
this
last
news
i
found
that
at
heart
i
was
still
very
much
a
all
thought
of
state
affairs
the
interests
of
my
new
country
and
of
my
old
country
were
alike
forgotten
in
the
selfish
joy
of
my
love
i
was
to
wed
my
little
princess
blissful
elation
gave
way
to
doubt
and
anxiety
the
death
of
iyeyoshi
had
not
yet
been
announced
abe
was
waiting
for
the
envoys
when
iyesada
had
been
duly
confirmed
in
his
rule
iyeyoshi
would
be
officially
declared
dead
and
would
be
buried
with
all
due
pomp
amongst
his
forefathers
either
at
shiba
or
uyeno
my
fear
was
that
once
the
period
of
mourning
had
begun
azai
might
not
be
permitted
to
marry
me
until
the
termination
of
the
prescribed
months
of
sorrow
though
puzzled
by
my
feverish
impatience
at
the
bare
possibility
of
delay
the
prince
urged
the
matter
upon
satsuma
the
daimio
no
less
willing
to
please
me
than
to
disappoint
keiki
enlisted
the
assistance
of
his
adopted
daughter
wife
the
lady
was
i
suspect
delighted
with
the
opportunity
to
remove
from
the
palace
one
whose
influence
was
far
greater
than
her
own
abe
found
iyesada
not
only
willing
but
urgent
to
bind
the
house
of
owari
to
his
interests
by
means
of
the
marriage
satsuma
offered
himself
as
intermediator
between
the
two
families
arrangements
were
made
under
a
mutual
agreement
that
in
view
of
the
circumstances
the
wedding
should
be
conducted
without
display
an
act
accomplished
escapes
opposition
and
a
large
share
of
the
criticism
otherwise
uttered
in
the
hope
of
prevention
the
wishes
of
azai
were
not
consulted
she
was
told
that
she
would
be
wedded
to
me
the
following
night
presents
were
exchanged
and
the
trousseau
of
my
bride
was
brought
at
once
to
owari
yashiki
in
the
charge
of
even
tokiwa
sama
was
impressed
by
the
display
of
silk
costumes
and
ornaments
and
artistic
articles
of
personal
and
household
use
arranged
in
the
bridal
apartments
by
the
ladies
of
the
princess
my
own
wardrobe
was
arranged
by
my
mother
and
her
maids
propriety
required
that
i
should
not
view
the
trousseau
of
my
bride
before
the
ceremony
but
chance
gave
me
one
glimpse
that
stirred
my
heart
to
deepest
tenderness
while
passing
one
of
the
inner
garden
courts
i
chanced
to
gaze
across
and
caught
sight
of
a
girl
within
the
opposite
veranda
it
was
o
setsu
san
bearing
in
the
favorite
dolls
of
her
mistress
i
sought
the
seclusion
of
a
grape
arbor
in
the
largest
of
the
gardens
and
mused
for
hours
upon
the
sweet
innocence
of
my
little
princess
bride
the
thought
of
her
childlike
purity
filled
me
with
adoration
i
had
won
the
love
and
trust
of
this
young
maiden
who
yet
played
with
her
dolls
i
must
be
very
gentle
with
her
death
had
deprived
her
of
a
fond
care
marriage
was
to
cut
her
off
from
home
and
mother
by
entering
the
family
of
owari
she
was
to
become
as
one
dead
to
her
own
family
she
had
been
the
petted
daughter
of
an
indulgent
father
she
was
to
become
the
wife
and
servant
of
a
husband
and
the
humble
subordinate
of
a
whose
commands
must
be
obeyed
yet
hers
was
a
fate
far
better
than
the
fate
of
most
japanese
brides
she
loved
me
and
knew
that
she
was
loved
others
went
to
husbands
unknown
to
them
many
without
so
much
as
the
preliminary
meeting
common
among
the
lower
classes
tokiwa
sama
i
knew
would
be
a
mild
tyrant
to
the
gentle
as
a
concession
to
my
prejudices
if
not
because
of
the
winsomeness
of
my
bride
she
would
not
deal
harshly
with
my
wife
this
i
knew
because
she
had
already
made
the
amazing
concession
of
supporting
me
in
a
contest
against
custom
it
was
my
earnest
desire
that
my
bride
should
come
to
the
wedding
without
the
customary
shaving
of
eyebrows
and
blackening
of
teeth
i
had
laid
great
stress
upon
this
strange
proposal
the
matter
had
been
carried
up
to
iyesada
and
precedent
found
for
a
postponement
of
the
senseless
blemishings
until
after
the
marriage
though
much
astonishment
was
expressed
over
the
betrayal
of
such
absurd
prejudices
by
the
prince
of
owari
satsuma
won
over
his
daughter
and
iyesada
bent
to
the
wish
of
his
shoguness
the
princess
azai
was
ordered
to
comply
with
the
whim
of
her
future
husband
for
the
time
at
least
i
had
saved
the
beauty
of
my
darling
the
good
news
of
this
concession
was
brought
to
me
by
satsuma
on
the
morning
of
my
wedding
day
and
it
added
no
little
to
my
rapturous
anticipations
overcome
with
joy
i
went
out
into
the
gardens
and
wandered
about
neglectful
of
my
duties
lost
in
a
maze
of
blissful
visions
but
presently
the
old
prince
sought
me
out
and
sobered
me
with
his
paternal
reproof
it
so
that
woroto
prepares
himself
for
matrimony
he
asked
the
day
of
all
days
when
a
man
should
think
reverently
of
the
family
my
son
has
neglected
to
stand
before
the
shrines
of
his
i
kowtowed
to
the
ground
rebuke
of
my
august
parent
is
just
i
will
go
at
he
restrained
me
with
a
gesture
as
i
rose
to
hasten
in
my
son
it
is
well
for
you
to
realize
that
what
you
have
set
your
heart
upon
with
such
strange
ardor
is
not
certain
of
attainment
even
certain
i
cried
bring
ill
news
from
the
palace
have
not
been
to
the
palace
from
all
i
know
your
fortunes
are
as
bright
as
is
this
sky
after
the
you
say
you
then
failed
to
grasp
the
characteristics
of
your
new
people
woroto
do
you
forget
that
the
times
when
we
should
most
expect
our
enemy
to
strike
are
the
hours
of
our
greatest
joys
and
triumphs
your
audience
as
prince
of
owari
brought
you
the
flask
of
poisoned
i
murmured
seized
with
vague
dread
have
heard
of
another
plot
keiki
plans
to
rob
me
of
my
bride
yuki
has
brought
word
again
from
kohana
has
been
heard
of
any
plot
yuki
brings
no
word
from
the
he
committed
the
grave
error
of
leaving
in
the
street
the
hollow
arrow
in
which
she
shot
out
to
him
the
message
of
the
poison
plot
if
it
was
picked
up
by
the
mito
men
we
have
the
explanation
why
no
more
arrows
have
dropped
beside
the
the
girl
will
render
no
further
service
to
the
daughter
my
bride
i
exclaimed
selfishly
heedless
of
whatever
fate
the
may
have
suffered
think
it
possible
that
keiki
will
again
attack
her
cortege
for
all
evil
from
your
foe
when
fortune
seems
fairest
go
now
the
gods
await
your
i
bowed
and
with
unfeigned
gravity
went
in
to
set
the
daily
offerings
before
the
buddhist
family
shrine
and
murmur
the
daily
invocation
before
the
shinto
tablets
forefathers
of
the
generations
and
of
our
families
and
of
our
kindred
unto
you
the
founders
of
our
homes
we
utter
the
gladness
of
our
my
duty
as
acting
head
of
the
household
was
fulfilled
but
my
disquiet
continued
i
returned
to
the
garden
and
roved
about
for
hours
unable
to
overcome
the
dread
of
impending
disaster
as
evening
approached
my
alarm
increased
though
i
knew
that
fujimaro
and
yuki
had
been
sent
with
a
powerful
escort
to
accompany
the
bride
when
i
was
required
to
go
in
to
prepare
for
the
ceremony
tokiwa
sama
sought
to
smile
away
my
dread
but
i
was
in
a
fever
of
apprehension
until
announcement
was
made
that
the
bridal
cortege
was
entering
the
great
gate
of
the
at
this
my
dread
gave
way
to
joy
no
less
unreasoning
i
hastened
in
my
ceremonial
costume
to
the
position
within
the
entrance
where
i
was
to
receive
my
bride
outside
to
right
and
left
two
fires
had
been
lighted
and
beside
each
an
aged
couple
stood
waiting
with
a
rice
mortar
near
me
was
stationed
one
of
the
with
a
lantern
and
other
ladies
stood
behind
her
the
armed
escort
had
halted
in
the
courtyard
and
the
bridal
party
was
already
entering
the
inner
enclosure
in
the
light
of
the
gay
lanterns
i
saw
the
of
the
princess
which
had
been
turned
about
end
for
end
to
symbolize
her
death
to
her
family
it
was
borne
forward
in
the
midst
of
the
high
officials
of
the
palace
household
my
chief
retainers
gathered
before
the
entrance
to
meet
and
exchange
congratulations
with
the
the
old
couples
beside
the
fires
began
to
pound
rice
in
their
mortars
and
to
call
out
felicitations
thousand
years
ten
thousand
years
the
which
had
been
placed
upon
the
mats
was
again
raised
and
borne
in
before
me
the
held
her
lantern
for
me
i
parted
the
curtain
and
looked
in
upon
the
lovely
face
of
my
bride
her
pure
young
eyes
met
mine
aglow
with
the
soft
radiance
of
perfect
love
and
trust
for
either
to
have
spoken
would
have
been
most
improper
but
we
gazed
deep
into
one
eyes
the
uttered
a
faint
murmur
azai
blushed
scarlet
and
raised
one
of
her
sleeves
before
her
face
with
her
free
hand
she
held
out
to
me
the
bag
of
brocaded
silk
that
contained
her
amulet
or
talisman
as
i
took
it
from
her
the
was
carried
in
past
me
led
by
the
lady
with
the
lantern
i
handed
the
amulet
bag
to
another
and
withdrew
to
my
private
rooms
even
to
my
impatience
the
interval
did
not
seem
unduly
prolonged
before
i
was
requested
to
enter
the
ceremonial
chamber
my
attendants
stopped
in
the
anteroom
i
entered
alone
azai
sat
in
the
place
of
honor
before
the
dressed
in
robes
of
pure
white
silk
which
had
been
sent
to
her
in
my
name
over
her
head
was
draped
a
veil
of
white
crepe
to
all
others
the
costume
was
symbolic
of
death
and
mourning
to
myself
it
was
the
emblem
of
bridal
purity
according
to
immemorial
custom
no
relatives
were
present
satsuma
as
our
mediator
took
the
place
of
priest
and
magistrate
although
he
now
had
nothing
to
say
and
nothing
else
to
do
than
to
sit
with
his
wife
aside
from
this
friendly
couple
o
setsu
san
and
others
of
the
attended
upon
their
mistress
food
and
had
been
laid
out
in
the
which
was
decorated
with
branches
of
pine
and
bamboo
and
cherry
when
i
had
taken
my
seat
below
and
to
one
side
of
azai
two
of
the
ladies
served
us
with
chestnuts
edible
seaweed
and
dried
fish
bowing
and
murmuring
gracious
words
of
compliment
the
was
in
two
wine
flasks
to
which
had
been
attached
a
pair
of
butterflies
symbolic
of
our
souls
these
flasks
and
two
heating
kettles
were
taken
from
the
to
the
lower
part
of
the
room
and
the
amber
wine
poured
ceremoniously
into
one
and
then
the
other
kettle
three
cups
placed
one
within
the
other
on
a
tray
were
brought
to
me
with
the
i
drank
twice
from
the
upper
cup
poured
a
little
from
the
full
kettle
into
the
empty
one
and
drank
again
from
the
same
cup
the
service
was
now
carried
before
azai
who
drank
and
poured
as
i
had
done
the
wine
was
returned
to
the
and
food
served
to
us
again
the
was
brought
out
and
we
drank
as
before
except
that
azai
was
served
first
and
used
the
second
cup
for
the
second
time
the
was
returned
to
the
and
food
served
last
of
all
the
was
brought
to
us
once
more
and
i
led
as
at
first
by
drinking
from
the
third
cup
throughout
this
mute
yet
solemn
ceremony
i
was
compelled
to
sit
with
face
half
averted
from
my
sweet
bride
to
look
at
her
would
have
been
rude
and
unmannerly
i
had
to
content
myself
with
stolen
at
her
dainty
head
under
its
soft
white
veil
she
held
her
eyes
modestly
downcast
i
now
rose
and
withdrew
to
one
room
and
azai
retired
to
another
while
our
attendants
were
served
with
refreshments
i
returned
to
take
the
seat
of
honor
immediately
my
little
bride
entered
no
longer
attired
in
white
but
in
a
kimono
of
soft
dark
silk
the
veil
had
been
removed
and
i
saw
that
her
hair
was
dressed
after
the
fashion
of
married
women
she
was
now
my
wife
as
she
nestled
down
in
the
place
which
had
been
mine
my
parents
and
the
wedding
guests
entered
to
congratulate
us
and
to
join
in
the
feast
that
was
served
for
the
time
being
austerity
was
laid
aside
and
joy
reigned
supreme
owari
was
providing
for
the
perpetuation
of
the
family
it
was
proper
for
all
relatives
and
friends
to
feast
and
rejoice
course
followed
course
and
wit
and
poetry
flowed
as
freely
as
the
amber
at
last
close
upon
midnight
the
feast
drew
to
a
close
and
the
guests
prepared
to
leave
i
sat
with
my
bride
receiving
the
final
congratulations
and
farewells
the
more
wearied
of
the
guests
hurried
off
the
others
prepared
to
follow
soon
the
last
would
withdraw
and
we
should
be
left
alone
with
satsuma
and
his
wife
who
were
to
conduct
us
to
the
bridal
chamber
suddenly
i
heard
voice
in
the
anteroom
raised
in
loud
protest
the
prince
hastened
out
through
the
midst
of
the
departing
guests
enraged
at
the
unseemly
disturbance
all
followed
his
going
with
startled
looks
in
the
hush
that
fell
upon
us
i
heard
voices
murmuring
punctilious
salutations
the
prince
reappeared
his
face
no
longer
flushed
but
hard
and
cold
he
waved
his
fan
towards
azai
and
commanded
in
a
harsh
voice
her
but
my
darling
had
sensed
the
danger
with
quick
intuition
she
threw
herself
before
me
and
grasped
at
the
edge
of
my
robe
over
her
bowed
head
i
caught
sight
of
a
grotesque
glittering
figure
on
the
threshold
it
was
keiki
in
full
armor
my
first
thought
was
that
the
occasion
had
enabled
the
mito
men
to
enter
the
by
stealth
and
overwhelm
our
retainers
in
their
quarters
yet
an
attack
however
sudden
and
stealthy
must
have
meant
some
uproar
of
yells
and
clashing
blades
we
could
not
have
failed
to
hear
the
struggle
even
had
there
been
no
other
sounds
than
the
shrieks
of
the
women
as
i
rose
i
perceived
that
the
sword
of
our
unwelcome
visitor
was
sheathed
and
in
the
hands
of
a
bearer
there
was
no
danger
of
immediate
violence
yuki
stood
close
at
the
shoulder
of
my
enemy
nevertheless
there
was
a
grim
menace
in
the
glinting
armor
and
hideous
of
the
son
of
mito
i
bowed
in
response
to
his
mocking
salute
and
attempted
an
ironical
greeting
sama
comes
late
to
my
wedding
feast
yet
food
remains
let
him
be
come
late
and
go
soon
he
replied
in
a
tone
that
seemed
to
bring
a
sneer
to
the
brazen
lips
of
his
gaping
maw
come
late
but
still
in
time
does
the
hairy
barbarian
grieve
that
i
did
not
come
sooner
i
turned
inquiringly
to
the
prince
before
the
enemy
he
could
betray
no
weakness
his
voice
sounded
harsh
and
constrained
sama
bears
the
edict
of
the
mikado
which
holds
that
woroto
is
legally
neither
my
son
nor
prince
of
owari
he
whom
i
have
regarded
as
my
son
is
declared
to
be
a
criminal

any
or

the
occasion
does
not
permit
of
delay
the
command

i
stooped
before
them
all
and
pressed
my
lips
upon
the
bloodless
lips
of
azai
my
wife
we
will
meet
on
that
other
side
go
my
lord
she
gasped
that
the
outcast
should
suffer
than
all
owari
i
replied
and
i
loosened
her
clutching
little
fingers
no
one
should
share
my
fate
she
tottered
up
to
follow
me
down
the
room
but
nature
was
more
merciful
than
keiki
she
swooned
into
the
arms
of
my
weeping
mother
the
prince
averted
his
head
unable
to
mask
his
emotion
i
advanced
swiftly
past
the
guests
that
had
lingered
and
held
out
my
sheathed
dirk
to
keiki
out

the
is

i
said
before
demon
he

enraged
at
the
shameful
name
i
gave
him
yuki
had
disappeared
but
the
prince
stepped
to
my
side
dono
will
escort
to
the
portico
him
who
was
his
son
he
said
we
walked
out
side
by
side
followed
by
keiki
and
his
swordbearer
we
went
in
silence
the
prince
could
offer
me
no
hope
and
it
was
no
time
to
give
way
to
grief
in
the
portico
we
exchanged
formal
bows
of
farewell
i
passed
on
out
yuki
approached
with
his
hands
in
his
sleeves
and
sought
to
edge
up
beside
me
i
divined
that
he
schemed
to
slip
me
one
or
both
of
my
revolvers
but
keiki
was
and
vigilant
he
thrust
himself
between
us
with
the
swordbearer
on
the
other
side
i
walked
out
through
the
state
gate
of
owari
yashiki
into
the
midst
of
the
of
mito
and
hitotsubashi
chapter
xxxi
in
the
power
of
mito
at
the
command
of
keiki
men
with
iron
gloves
seized
me
and
stripped
me
of
my
brocaded
wedding
robes
bound
hand
and
foot
i
was
flung
into
a
and
a
net
entwined
about
me
i
was
spared
the
shame
of
daylight
but
torches
and
lanterns
exposed
the
captive
to
all
who
chose
to
look
and
revile
they
bore
me
along
the
outer
moat
to
mito
yashiki
and
through
the
great
gate
into
the
grim
torture
chamber
without
loosening
the
rattan
withes
that
cut
my
flesh
they
dropped
me
into
a
dungeon
pit
built
beneath
the
stone
floor
of
the
chamber
i
was
flung
in
headlong
but
managed
to
turn
in
the
air
and
alight
upon
my
feet
otherwise
i
believe
the
fall
would
have
proved
fatal
had
i
been
stunned
i
must
have
smothered
in
the
slime
that
covered
the
bottom
of
the
pit
even
as
it
was
i
could
not
hold
my
balance
with
my
bound
feet
squarely
as
i
struck
i
sprawled
prone
in
the
filth
as
i
struggled
up
to
a
sitting
position
keiki
flung
down
a
torch
at
me
the
flaming
end
tore
and
seared
the
skin
of
my
naked
side
and
glanced
down
into
the
slime
with
a
loud
splutter
the
snarl
of
the
beast
he
jeered

been
told
much
of

now
tell
of
the
toad
in
the
with
this
a
great
stone
was
clapped
over
the
mouth
of
the
dungeon
and
i
was
left
to
the
misery
of
my
fetid
quarters
and
the
anguish
of
my
thoughts
the
moistening
of
my
bonds
in
the
slime
eased
somewhat
the
pain
of
their
incutting
edges
but
nothing
could
ease
my
mental
agony
since
the
first
i
had
been
as
it
were
dazed
by
the
disaster
that
had
befallen
me
now
i
no
longer
had
the
presence
of
my
enemy
to
sustain
the
anger
that
had
added
to
my
bewilderment
cold
horror
dampened
my
fury
even
as
the
dank
air
of
the
dungeon
chilled
my
fevered
body
as
my
brain
cooled
i
began
to
realize
with
frightful
clearness
the
full
measure
of
my
downfall
one
hour
prince
of
owari
in
all
yedo
second
to
none
other
than
the
shogun
the
next
a
despised
barbarian
toad
in
this
pit
of
filth
one
hour
the
bridegroom
of
the
daughter
the
next
an
outcast
menaced
with
atrocious
torture
and
infamous
execution
in
vain
i
sought
to
gain
a
shred
of
hope
by
wild
thoughts
of
rescue
always
i
came
back
to
the
bitter
realization
that
mito
had
outwitted
owari
backed
by
the
mikadoic
decree
mito
was
all
but
unassailable
armed
with
the
authority
of
the
shogunate
old
rekko
and
his
faction
held
the
sword
above
owari
eager
for
a
sign
of
rebellion
my
father
had
forewarned
me
that
he
could
do
nothing
if
the
shogun
commanded
my
punishment
i
thought
of
satsuma
and
the
power
of
his
personality
with
a
momentary
glimmer
if
mito
failed
to
bar
his
way
to
the
palace
the
great
daimio
could
reach
iyesada
through
his
daughter
iyesada
would
command
abe
and
then
but
abe
had
called
upon
the
tiger
for
aid
and
had
been
lured
on
until
he
had
put
his
head
into
the
mouth
he
would
have
enough
to
do
to
extricate
himself
and
his
master
without
troubling
over
the
difficulties
of
a
toad
in
pit
all
was
lost
to
me
all
my
new
country
and
friends
rank
and
title
father
and
mother
and
azai
i
had
to
thank
the
mephitic
gases
of
the
dungeon
for
a
merciful
dulling
of
consciousness
with
the
single
opening
at
the
top
covered
over
the
air
became
so
close
and
foul
that
i
sank
into
a
stupor
i
cowered
lower
in
the
slime
with
my
chin
fallen
forward
on
my
breast
my
anguish
resolved
itself
into
hideous
unending
nightmares
a
sharp
pang
in
the
front
of
my
left
breast
roused
me
from
my
torpor
about
me
i
saw
the
loathsome
walls
of
the
dungeon
illumined
by
a
ray
of
reflected
sunlight
the
darting
pain
in
my
breast
redoubled
in
sharpness
i
was
jerked
upright
a
pole
had
been
lowered
through
the
hole
above
me
and
the
hook
upon
its
end
had
been
slipped
under
my
left
arm
when
drawn
up
the
point
of
the
hook
had
pierced
the
muscles
of
my
chest
strong
hands
hoisted
me
roughly
upwards
to
the
mouth
of
the
pit
i
was
swung
out
and
cast
down
upon
the
stone
flagging
of
the
torture
chamber
the
shock
won
a
groan
from
me
where
even
the
hook
had
failed
toad
croaks
jeered
a
voice
i
should
have
known
had
i
been
dying
numbed
by
my
bonds
i
could
scarcely
twist
my
head
about
to
glare
my
hate
into
his
beautiful
evil
face
he
smiled
and
bowed
low
to
me
the
bridegroom
fresh
come
from
his
bridal
chamber
ten
thousand
felicitous
years
lord
will
not
permit
the
beast
to
stand
unwashed
before
the
presence
of
the
august
rekko
sama
remarked
one
of
the
chamberlains
who
stood
beside
keiki
august
prince
abhors
hot
water
be
brought
commanded
keiki
were
a
shame
to
defile
even
an
bath
with
the
filth
of
a
at
the
word
attendants
clattered
out
to
fetch
buckets
of
steaming
water
the
first
bucketful
was
so
near
scalding
that
i
writhed
under
it
like
an
eel
in
the
pan
others
no
less
hot
followed
in
quick
succession
while
men
with
brooms
scoured
my
parboiled
skin
and
beat
me
between
the
drenchings
i
thought
i
should
die
of
the
torture
yet
the
water
was
not
quite
hot
enough
to
scald
me
and
between
it
and
the
scouring
brooms
i
was
cleansed
of
the
dungeon
filth
no
surgeon
could
have
bathed
my
wounds
more
thoroughly
my
violent
gasps
pumped
the
pure
air
deep
into
my
poisoned
lungs
and
the
heavy
throbs
of
my
heart
sent
the
blood
tingling
through
my
benumbed
limbs
and
brain
when
keiki
gave
command
to
cease
the
washing
i
lay
outstretched
on
the
wet
stones
bruised
and
aching
from
head
to
foot
but
freed
from
all
the
ill
effects
of
the
pit
august
father
will
now
view
the
snow
white
skin
of
the
said
keiki
loose
the
ankle
the
rattan
about
my
ankles
was
slashed
apart
and
i
was
jerked
to
my
feet
though
weak
and
unsteady
i
was
able
to
stand
unaided
prodding
dirks
drove
me
across
to
the
front
of
the
torture
chamber
where
a
frame
with
curtains
of
split
bamboo
had
been
set
up
on
the
matting
of
the
raised
floor
keiki
stepped
up
and
kowtowed
beside
the
frame
i
heard
no
sound
but
presently
he
turned
and
addressed
me
with
mock
courtesy
is
requested
to
exhibit
to
august
eyes
the
manners
of
his
i
stared
at
the
centre
of
the
curtain
through
which
i
fancied
that
i
saw
the
outline
of
a
seated
figure
prince
of
mito
is
said
to
regard
as
midway
between
beasts
and
demons
i
replied
will
have
ample
opportunity
to
judge
of
manners
when
the
black
ships
of
my
people
return
to
yedo
sama
will
not
be
so
unkind
as
to
compel
the
august
one
to
wait
an
uncertain
event
purred
keiki
is
made
that
he
show
the
behavior
of
a
of
low
birth
who
has
been
overcome
with
is
evident
that
rekko
sama
seeks
to
ape
the
tricks
of
the
shoguns
with
the
dutchmen
i
rejoined
is
this
difference
rekko
sama
is
not
yet
shogun
and
i
am
not
a
dutch
smile
deepened
and
he
murmured
imploringly
will
not
the
american
lord
condescend
to
exhibit
the
manner
in
which
a
of
his
people
salutes
his
bride
had
my
hands
been
free
i
must
have
leaped
upon
the
raised
floor
and
throttled
him
or
been
killed
in
the
attempt
i
bowed
over
and
waited
until
i
had
regained
my
my
reply
was
uttered
as
suavely
as
his
jeer
my
land
there
is
an
inferior
people
and
they
are
a
race
of
base
savages
who
until
conquered
and
subjected
by
my
people
delighted
in
the
torment
of
their
across
face
flitted
a
look
that
might
have
done
credit
to
an
iroquois
or
sioux
warrior
dancing
before
the
stake
of
a
burning
enemy
he
was
defeated
on
his
own
ground
there
was
a
short
pause
i
fancied
that
i
heard
a
murmur
keiki
signed
with
his
fan
and
waved
me
aside
behind
where
i
had
been
standing
was
a
post
similar
to
the
one
in
the
torture
chamber
of
the
high
court
a
screen
slipped
open
and
two
appeared
with
a
woman
between
them
as
they
crossed
to
the
post
the
woman
raised
her
head
it
was
kohana
san
she
smiled
and
bowed
to
me
as
if
i
had
been
seated
before
her
in
the
state
audience
hall
of
owari
yashiki
she
would
have
kowtowed
had
the
pariahs
loosened
their
brutal
grip
of
her
rounded
arms
keiki
looked
at
her
with
a
devilish
smile
complicity
of
the
in
the
crimes
of
the
barbarian
is
established
he
said
may
yet
win
the
mercy
of
a
swift
death

the
torturers
dragged
the
girl
to
the

and
lashed
her
fast
a
silk
cord

looped
around
her
head
and
twisted
tight
with
a
stick

keiki

told
she
replied
the
torturer
with
the
stick
began
to
twist
at
the
first
shriek
i
bounded
forward
to
fling
myself
upon
the
guards
rushed
between
and
bore
me
back
the
shrieks
died
away
in
a
moan
kohana
had
swooned
the
cord
was
relaxed
and
a
pungent
powder
held
to
the
nostrils
she
revived

she
gasped
keiki
made
a
sign
and
the
torturer
again
twisted
the

as
it
tightened
the
agony
became
greater
than
the
girl
could
bear
have
mercy
she
screamed

keiki
and
he
cast
an
exultant
look
at
me

now
learn
the
for
a
few
moments
the
tortured
bosom
rose
and
fell
in
gasping
sobs
at
last
she
summoned
strength
enough
to
lift
her
head
and
speak
but
it
was
not
keiki
whom
she
addressed
her
voice
rang
out
in
the
ecstasy
of

she
paused
blood
gushed
from
between
her
lips
her
head
sank
forward

of
the
wrenched
open
her
mouth
and
cried
out
that
she
had
bitten
off
her
tongue
love
had
triumphed
over
hate
the
most
frightful
torture
could
not
now
compel
the
to
denounce
the
friend
of
her
dead
lord
for
a
moment
i
thought
that
keiki
would
hurl
himself
upon
the
heroic
girl
a
low
murmur
came
from
behind
the
bamboo
curtains
keiki
signed
to
the
the
traitress
to
the
cage
until
the
time
appointed
for
her

i
gibed
at
him
between
my
bleeding
lips
the
shot
struck
though
not
where
i
had
aimed
commanded
a
stern
voice
from
behind
the
curtains
barbarian

shall
have
no
justification
for
his
revilement
of
mito
let
the
sentence
and
warrant
be
shown
him
and
let
him
be
caged
as
a
condemned
i
had
touched
the
vanity
of
the
hidden
prince
of
mito
keiki
bent
to
mutter
a
protest
for
answer
two
documents
were
thrust
out
between
the
slits
of
the
bamboo
curtain
keiki
mustered
his
smile
and
turned
to
open
the
documents
before
me
that
i
might
see
their
vermilion
seals

of
the
high
court
condemning
to
death

received
the
sentence
of
the
high
court
and
the
warrant
of
the
council
of
elders
replied
keiki
suavely
order
of
annulment
had
been
received
from
minamoto
to
this
i
had
no
answer
there
could
be
no
doubt
of
the
duplicity
of
my
enemies
the
entire
proceeding
was
illegal
but
i
was
absolutely
in
their
power
to
have
cried
out
in
protest
would
have
served
only
to
gratify
their
malice
finding
that
i
remained
silent
keiki
made
a
sign
i
was
led
past
the
gaping
mouth
of
the
pit
and
out
through
a
low
opening
into
a
room
lined
with
wooden
cages
a
covered
my
wounds
with
plasters
of
dampened
paper
a
tattered
silk
kimono
was
wrapped
about
me
and
i
was
thrust
into
one
of
the
cages
after
a
time
food
and
tea
were
brought
and
set
in
between
the
massive
bars
to
my
astonishment
i
discovered
that
i
was
ravenously
hungry
i
devoured
the
food
and
stretched
out
upon
the
rough
planks
of
my
prison
cell
overcome
with
plethora
and
exhaustion
a
heavy
sleep
came
to
ease
my
aching
body
and
racked
brain
chapter
xxxii
led
out
to
execution
for
two
days
i
was
kept
caged
but
fed
and
waited
upon
by
gaolers
with
utmost
deference
why
there
should
have
been
such
a
delay
i
could
not
conjecture
unless
time
was
required
to
check
some
move
of
my
friends
or
unless
mito
wished
kohana
and
myself
to
regain
our
strength
so
that
we
might
suffer
the
more
keenly
during
our
execution
utmost
precautions
were
taken
that
i
should
find
no
means
to
put
an
end
to
myself
on
the
third
day
i
was
roused
before
dawn
and
led
to
a
bathroom
my
wounds
were
now
almost
healed
and
my
full
strength
had
come
back
to
me
but
when
i
stepped
from
the
cage
my
arms
were
gripped
by
two
in
such
a
manner
that
a
slight
twist
would
have
dislocated
the
shoulder
joints
of
this
i
was
given
a
hint
as
a
warning
against
any
attempt
to
escape
otherwise
i
was
treated
with
deference
after
the
bath
i
was
clad
in
a
worn
but
clean
robe
of
silk
and
led
back
to
my
cage
for
breakfast
when
i
had
eaten
i
was
again
asked
to
leave
the
cage
as
i
stepped
through
the
opening
seized
me
and
lashed
my
arms
behind
my
back
i
was
led
out
to
a
court
crowded
with
warriors
in
full
armor
and
forced
into
a
over
which
nets
were
wound
dawn
had
not
yet
come
but
torches
flung
a
weird
and
lurid
light
over
the
outlandish
figures
of
the
armored
another
was
borne
forward
past
mine
within
the
nets
that
enmeshed
it
i
saw
the
bowed
form
of
a
woman
she
raised
her
head
and
i
perceived
the
pallid
face
of
kohana
she
greeted
me
with
a
smile
that
wrenched
my
heart
bless
you
i
called
strong
there
is
one
who
awaits
us
beyond
her
dark
eyes
glistened
with
tears
of
gratitude
at
the
words
of
sympathy
but
the
bearers
of
her
hastened
past
she
disappeared
among
the
close
ranks
of
the
a
signal
was
given
and
the
torch
bearers
filed
out
of
the
court
the
strutted
after
with
clanking
armor
others
appeared
and
fell
in
behind
my
i
was
borne
out
in
the
midst
of
the
procession
outside
the
gateway
of
the
keiki
mounted
on
an
armored
stallion
waited
at
the
head
of
several
thousand
warriors
the
lowly
and
the
despised
were
to
be
escorted
through
yedo
by
an
army
of
though
not
in
honor
dawn
was
at
hand
as
we
started
along
the
causeway
of
the
outer
moat
towards
owari
yashiki
far
away
over
the
western
suburbs
of
the
city
i
caught
the
glorious
vision
of
glowing
high
in
the
sky
like
a
symbol
of
hope
in
the
night
of
my
despair
my
spirits
revived
with
unreasoning
elation
but
keiki
led
his
warriors
on
along
the
causeway
and
within
the
the
exultant
mito
men
were
marching
past
owari
yashiki
in
the
full
light
of
dawn
with
an
insolent
clamor
of
conches
and
wooden
clappers
the
ranks
about
me
opened
out
that
i
might
be
seen
no
sound
came
from
the
no
face
peered
from
the
grated
windows
we
clashed
past
the
great
gateway
it
was
closed
tight
the
mito
men
strutted
past
shouting
in
derision
no
band
rushed
out
in
fierce
sortie
as
i
had
expected
no
face
appeared
at
the
windows
i
was
abandoned
to
my
fate
my
head
sank
forward
upon
my
breast
before
me
rose
a
picture
of
the
beautiful
gardens
and
fairylike
palace
of
my
quaint
and
gentle
little
mother
tokiwa
my
stately
father
but
all
vanished
before
the
white
face
of
azai
a
pang
of
doubt
and
despair
pierced
my
brain
was
azai
still
here
in
the
vainly
longing
for
me
had
she
gone
before
me
with
her
dirk
through
that
white
throat
or
had
she
been
taken
away
to
be
given
to
keiki
i
muttered
a
curse
upon
my
friends
i
was
being
borne
past
the
end
of
owari
yashiki
and
not
even
yuki
my
swordbearer
had
struck
a
blow
for
me
down
through
west
and
south
yedo
was
a
long
and
tedious
march
but
i
failed
to
heed
the
passage
of
time
i
had
sunk
into
a
lethargy
of
despair
only
once
i
roused
up
they
were
bearing
me
past
the
groves
of
shiba
now
glorious
with
the
tints
of
autumn
the
northeast
monsoon
after
weeks
of
steady
effort
had
blown
the
moisture
of
the
japan
current
southward
the
air
was
as
clear
as
crystal
the
blue
sky
cloudless
it
was
no
day
to
lead
a
man
out
to
a
hideous
death
i
should
have
been
strolling
through
the
gardens
with
azai
on
to
the
tokaido
and
down
along
the
bay
shore
through
shinagawa
marched
the
grimly
grotesque
warriors
of
antique
nippon
it
seemed
a
lifetime
since
my
dear
brother
had
led
me
after
the
cortege
of
satsuma
through
the
black
gate
and
along
the
broad
way
and
down
that
narrow
street
to
the
house
of
kohana
now
the
was
going
with
me
to
meet
him
through
the
black
gate
of
death
at
the
southern
boundary
of
shinagawa
the
main
force
of
our
escort
halted
we
were
borne
onward
guarded
only
by
a
hundred
swordsmen
and
an
equal
number
of
pikemen
we
came
to
the
pillory
upon
which
i
had
seen
the
five
heads
my
bearers
swung
past
this
was
not
the
place
where
we
were
to
suffer
out
on
the
blue
bay
i
saw
great
foundations
of
stone
rising
from
the
shoals
that
barred
the
approach
to
yedo
toiling
workers
swarmed
over
and
about
the
forts
to
which
strings
of
sampans
were
lightering
blocks
of
stone
from
junks
that
lay
in
the
offing
other
craft
sailed
up
or
down
the
bay
or
lay
at
anchor
in
the
deeper
water
down
towards
the
tall
white
tower
on
the
cape
opposite
kawasaki
sailor
bred
i
looked
out
upon
the
wide
bay
with
a
sudden
rousing
from
lethargy
wind
waves
swelling
sails
all
spoke
of
life
and
freedom
if
only
the
majestic
might
come
steaming
around
that
towered
cape
i
could
see
the
grotesque
warriors
about
me
scuttling
like
crabs
before
the
thunder
of
the
cannon
but
perry
had
promised
the
reluctant
shogunate
many
months
for
deliberation
and
i
had
heard
the
report
from
nagasaki
that
the
rebellion
was
raging
in
china
i
could
hope
for
no
aid
either
from
my
own
countrymen
or
the
ships
of
any
other
western
power
the
lives
and
property
of
white
men
were
endangered
at
shanghai
by
the
chinese
rebels
it
was
no
time
for
squadrons
to
be
cruising
along
the
remote
coasts
of
japan
we
approached
omori
a
group
of
villagers
shouted
at
me
in
derision
and
ran
ahead
of
our
party
others
joined
them
by
the
score
the
news
spread
down
the
tokaido
i
saw
men
in
silk
robes
pilgrims
and
even
priests
cutting
across
towards
the
bay
shore
keiki
turned
off
the
tokaido
we
had
come
to
the
execution
ground
the
mailed
clattered
through
the
midst
of
the
motley
crowd
assembled
to
gloat
upon
the
torture
of
the
victims
there
were
peasants
and
fishermen
merchants
and
porters
cowled
priests
and
pilgrims
and
a
scattering
of
but
i
had
no
eyes
for
those
who
had
come
to
see
me
suffer
the
mito
men
were
lining
out
to
right
and
left
i
was
borne
past
after
kohana
to
the
edge
of
the
hideous
blood
pit
bones
crunched
under
the
sandals
of
my
bearers
all
about
me
the
ground
was
composed
more
of
the
dead
of
countless
executions
than
of
soil
before
us
stood
a
heavy
post
with
at
top
and
bottom
a
few
paces
to
the
left
was
a
massive
gibbet
with
a
chain
dangling
from
its
arm
executioners
advanced
bearing
a
huge
copper
kettle
which
they
swung
to
the
chain
of
the
gibbet
oil
was
poured
into
the
kettle
and
a
fire
lighted
below
the
came
to
my
and
unwound
the
nets
but
as
they
dragged
me
out
keiki
called
to
them
one
took
up
his
position
beside
me
ready
to
catch
me
with
a
should
i
attempt
to
run
the
others
went
to
she
was
dragged
out
and
taken
to
the
cross
which
was
directly
in
front
of
me
less
than
six
yards
away
the
tore
the
robes
from
about
her
shoulders
the
first
dancer
of
yedo
stood
before
the
gaping
mob
nude
to
the
waist
in
a
twinkling
she
was
triced
up
to
the
cross
her
tender
wrists
lashed
to
the
upper
arm
her
ankles
to
the
lower
an
brought
a
sheaf
of
slender
lances
and
handed
one
to
his
chief
the
executioner
moved
around
and
put
the
lance
tip
to
the
side
i
knew
that
his
purpose
was
to
pierce
upwards
through
her
body
without
striking
a
vital
organ
my
eyelids
fell
i
could
not
endure
the
sight
but
again
keiki
interfered
he
commanded
and
he
rode
forward
until
between
me
and
the
gibbet
until
the
oil
is
heated
you
may
miss
your
thrust
the
girl
may
not
linger
long
enough
to
enjoy
the
first
dipping
of
the
lord
protested
the
is
known
to
you
that
i
have
more
than
once
thrust
through
two
and
even
three
spears
from
each
side
yet
death
did
not
follow
until
after
many
hours
this
is
one
who
can
endure
keiki
did
not
deign
to
reply
the
executioner
drew
aside
a
step
the
crowd
pressed
closer
and
an
oppressive
hush
fell
upon
all
the
gloating
spectators
stared
from
myself
to
kohana
and
from
her
to
the
great
kettle
where
the
were
casting
brush
and
faggots
on
the
fire
even
the
certainty
of
torture
can
not
hold
the
mind
to
any
one
thought
for
many
moments
i
found
myself
heeding
such
trifles
as
the
downward
swoop
of
a
flock
of
gulls
and
the
heat
of
the
midday
sun
upon
my
bare
head
i
noticed
with
idle
curiosity
that
those
of
the
crowd
who
had
pressed
forward
on
each
side
were
nearly
all
men
of
the
lower
classes
the
men
held
back
behind
the
guards
seemingly
ashamed
of
their
morbid
curiosity
gazing
out
over
the
bay
i
began
to
count
the
junks
and
fishing
smacks
sampans
came
and
went
between
the
anchored
craft
from
a
junk
that
lay
opposite
us
a
large
boat
was
sculling
leisurely
shoreward
i
flushed
with
petulant
anger
at
the
thought
that
here
was
another
party
coming
to
see
us
tortured
yet
too
indifferent
to
hasten
the
purring
voice
of
keiki
recalled
me
to
the
horror
of
the
situation
kettle
boils
he
called
the
chief
executioner
stepped
forward
with
his
spear
i
caught
a
farewell
glance
from
kohana
she
raised
her
face
to
the
sun
i
turned
my
head
aside
and
found
myself
gazing
into
the
white
face
of
azai
i
stared
stupefied
she
was
wrapped
about
in
the
white
dress
of
a
pilgrim
the
dress
of
mourning
had
she
come
to
die
with
me
that
thought
was
more
fearful
than
the
thought
of
death
in
the
boiling
oil
a
man
in
white
behind
her
looked
up
so
that
i
saw
his
face
under
the
broad
hat
brim
my
heart
leaped
i
was
to
die
a
merciful
death
i
and
azai
my
wife
yuki
had
not
failed
me

bared
blades
a
dart
whirred
past
me
to
drive
through
the
of
the
executioner
as
he
bent
to
thrust
his
lance
in
the
same
instant
yuki
flung
off
his
pilgrim
robe
and
leaped
at
keiki
with
outflashing
sword
his
burnished
armor
glittering
in
the
sudden
as
was
the
attack
keiki
flung
himself
away
from
the
stroke
with
such
quickness
that
the
blade
barely
cut
through
the
mail
on
his
side
wrenched
about
by
the
powerful
bit
his
stallion
reared
above
yuki
instantly
the
swordmaster
struck
a
slashing
upward
blow
that
half
severed
the
neck
at
the
base
i
saw
the
stallion
rolling
over
upon
his
rider
a
score
of
mito
warriors
were
leaping
to
drive
back
yuki
i
saw
azai
darting
towards
me
all
about
me
was
a
wild
swirl
of
shrieking
fleeing
commonfolk
of
mito
men
yelling
and
slashing
in
blind
fury
and
crestless
warriors
still
half
disguised
who
had
already
cut
down
their
own
number
of
mito
men
i
sprang
to
meet
azai
the
with
the
hook
grappled
my
robe
and
dragged
me
to
the
ground
azai
sprang
past
me
i
twisted
about
and
saw
her
strike
at
the
stooping
the
pariah
fell
inert
pierced
through
the
nape
of
his
neck
a
mob
of
yelling

warriors
surged
about
us
azai
flung
herself
upon
me
to
shield
me
with
her
tender
body
a
mito
man
fell
heavily
across
us
the
blood
gushing
from
a
great
wound
in
his
breast
i
heard
the
triumphant
shout
of
yuki
the
wave
of
fighting
men
surged
back
my
bonds
parted
under
dirk
edge
she
sprang
up
and
tugged
with
her
girlish
strength
to
help
me
to
my
feet
from
the
bosom
of
her
robe
she
plucked
out
my
revolvers
first
one
and
then
the
other
as
i
caught
them
from
her
i
glanced
around
at
the
wild
a
group
of
mito
men
were
dragging
their
lord
from
under
his
horse
the
mass
were
closing
in
upon
my
rescuers
who
had
rallied
with
yuki
to
drive
them
back
from
me
all
told
his
followers
numbered
less
than
fifty
though
picked
men
they
were
falling
fast
before
the
overwhelming
numbers
of
the

men
the
pikemen
in
the

at
them
over

shoulders
of

ran
with
me
to

and

at
the

me
from

i
shot
him
through

from
the

of
the

and
half
a
hundred
came
charging
around
to

and

us
off
i
began
to
fire
but
the
mito
men
were
not
to
be
stopped
by
my
balls
they
rushed
in
upon
us
i
drew
azai
back
kohana
was
too
quick
for
me
she
sprang
aside
to
the
gibbet
an
oil
dipper
was
lying
upon
the
ground
she
caught
it
up
and
dipped
into
the
boiling
oil
with
a
skilful
sweep
she
dashed
the
seething
fluid
into
the
faces
of
the
foremost
warriors
shrieking
in
agony
they
turned
to
fly
again
the
girl
dipped
and
flung
and
again
in
quick
succession
the
mito
leaders
plunged
back
amongst
those
behind
in
wild
panic
another
ladle
lay
beside
the
kettle
i
caught
it
up
and
helped
fling
out
the
oil
at
those
who
would
have
boiled
me
in
it
the
mito
men
of
the
flanking
party
turned
and
rushed
back
among
those
who
were
engaged
in
furious
struggle
with
our
defenders
throwing
them
into
momentary
confusion
the
moment
was
not
lost
by
yuki
at
his
shout
our
men
closed
about
us
the
ladles
were
taken
from
kohana
and
me
and
we
were
swept
forward
with
azai
the
mito
men
charging
after
us
were
again
thrown
into
confusion
by
ladlefuls
of
seething
oil
they
spread
out
on
either
side
to
close
around
us
but
we
had
gained
a
slight
start
a
few
yards
offshore
i
saw
waiting
the
large
scullboat
naked
rowers
stood
ready
at
their
long
sweeps
the
shoreward
gunwale
was
lined
with
women
dressed
in
black
robes
and
stiff
black
hats
and
armed
with
halberds
the
mito
men
closed
in
again
upon
our
rear
and
flanks
and
sought
desperately
to
push
forward
and
head
us
our
men
fought
them
off
with
still
greater
desperation
the
shore
was
not
far
five
and
twenty
men
were
left
when
we
gained
the
beach
and
splashed
down
into
the
water
yuki
though
severely
wounded
yet
fought
best
of
all
spurring
his
fellows
to
superhuman
efforts
with
his
cries
down
the
beach
with
us
plunged
the
mito
men
goaded
on
by
the
furious
commands
of
their
lord
i
caught
a
glimpse
of
his
figure
upborne
between
two
of
his
retainers
but
my
pistol
ball
glanced
on
the
of
a
warrior
who
leaped
before
him
down
the
bank
azai
slipped
upon
the
slimy
clay
bottom
i
caught
her
up
and
plunged
forward
dragging
kohana
by
the
arm
on
either
side
of
us
mito
warriors
and
our
own
men
fell
maimed
into
the
muddied
water
to
flounder
and
drown
a
dozen
of
the
enemy
dashed
ahead
to
board
the
boat
the
women
led
by
o
setsu
san
screamed
defiance
and
struck
at
the
mailed
warriors
with
skilful
blows
of
their
halberds
only
two
of
the
enemy
gained
the
side
of
the
boat
both
were
overtaken
and
cut
down
by
the
foremost
of
our
party
almost
outspent
we
floundered
forward
through
the
water
to
the
boat
o
setsu
san
and
her
women
beat
off
the
mito
men
with
their
halberds
while
we
clambered
aboard
i
swung
azai
and
then
kohana
over
the
gunwale
and
vaulted
in
after
them
a
few
of
our
men
were
in
before
me
such
of
the
others
as
had
not
fallen
came
staggering
alongside
all
wounded
the
stronger
ones
paused
to
meet
the
furious
attempt
of
the
mito
men
to
overwhelm
them
and
capture
the
boat
the
women
whirled
their
halberds
the
naked
oarsmen
beat
at
the
mito
men
with
their
sweeps
i
fired
every
cartridge
that
remained
in
my
revolvers
and
shouted
for
all
to
climb
aboard
those
already
in
the
boat
stood
with
brandished
swords
those
in
the
water
turned
to
clamber
over
the
gunwale
the
mito
men
rushed
after
the
women
redoubled
their
blows
yuki
still
stood
with
his
face
to
the
enemy
and
shouted
to
the
oarsmen
to
back
offshore
the
brave
man
meant
to
stand
where
he
was
and
guard
our
retreat
until
cut
down
i
reached
over
and
dragged
him
alongside
the
boat
had
begun
to
back
water
under
the
powerful
strokes
of
the
scullers
finding
that
i
would
not
release
him
yuki
turned
and
leaped
aboard
i
caught
up
the
sword
of
a
man
who
lay
dying
and
thrust
out
at
the
mito
men
as
they
grasped
at
the
bows
yuki
and
such
of
his
men
as
could
still
fight
beat
at
the
enemy
slashing
through
the
mailed
arms
that
sought
to
hold
the
boat
but
the
brave
women
did
far
more
with
their
halberds
with
a
cry
of
triumph
we
beat
off
the
last
mito
man
and
swept
clear
i
glanced
about
and
saw
azai
fling
down
a
halberd
to
kneel
beside
one
of
the
wounded
men
o
setsu
and
kohana
and
all
the
other
women
dropped
their
halberds
to
follow
the
example
of
their
mistress
yuki
sheathed
his
hacked
sword
and
sank
down
before
me
the
blood
oozing
through
his
riven
armor
lord
he
murmured
could
not
strike
but
could
your
august
father
gave
me
the
best
swordsmen
of
the
clan
it
is
for
my
lord
to
win
his
way
over
the
sea
to
kagoshima
pledges
shelter
to
my
lord
and
his
wife
the
daughter
farewell
my
lord
i
go
he
sank
prostrate
at
my
feet
at
my
cry
azai
darted
to
me
and
after
her
o
setsu
other
women
aided
them
to
strip
off
the
broken
armor
they
would
save
him
if
he
might
be
saved
i
sprang
up
to
order
the
boat
brought
about
the
mito
men
had
floundered
after
us
till
the
water
came
to
their
armpits
they
could
come
no
farther
no
man
could
swim
in
armor
such
as
weighted
them
down
at
my
command
the
scullers
brought
the
boat
around
bows
on
and
headed
her
for
the
nearest
junk
she
drove
forward
out
across
the
dancing
whitecaps
at
racing
speed
aboard
the
junk
the
crew
was
shortening
cable
ready
to
weigh
anchor
and
set
sail
one
of
the
wounded
men
called
to
me
and
pointed
to
the
shore
mito
warriors
stripped
of
their
armor
were
running
swiftly
towards
yedo
others
waved
banners
and
garments
in
frantic
efforts
to
signal
the
many
passing
junks
and
boats
a
fishing
smack
sheered
out
of
its
course
to
intercept
us
but
bore
off
again
at
sight
of
our
bared
blades
we
raced
on
the
long
sculls
bowing
under
the
powerful
strokes
of
the
rowers
these
men
too
were
owari
retainers
they
stood
in
their
places
and
thrust
at
the
handles
of
their
sweeps
with
their
broad
chests
rejoiced
to
serve
him
who
had
been
the
chief
of
the
clan
the
poop
of
the
junk
reared
high
before
us
the
hope
in
my
heart
rose
to
a
certainty
there
was
no
gaping
hole
in
the
stern
of
the
clumsy
craft
she
was
one
of
the
junks
that
the
shogunate
had
sought
to
convert
into
a
warship
i
remembered
that
my
clan
had
offered
to
equip
and
man
part
of
the
fleet
we
shot
alongside
lines
were
flung
to
us
and
made
fast
the
rowers
helped
us
lift
the
disabled
warriors
up
over
the
low
bulwarks
amidships
while
the
crew
weighed
anchor
and
hoisted
their
great
square
sail
two
men
had
died
of
their
wounds
but
yuki
still
breathed
he
was
lifted
aboard
and
carried
into
the
cabin
followed
by
azai
and
o
setsu
and
kohana
as
the
ship
came
about
the
crew
shouted
and
pointed
up
the
bay
a
squadron
of
and
were
bearing
down
upon
us
the
women
were
all
aboard
i
scrambled
after
with
the
rowers
stones
were
flung
down
into
the
boat
to
scuttle
her
and
she
was
cast
adrift
with
the
two
dead
men
with
the
monsoon
blowing
fresh
on
her
port
quarter
the
junk
was
already
beginning
to
run
down
the
bay
at
a
rate
that
surprised
me
the
bronzed
skipper
came
pattering
down
from
beside
his
huge
tiller
to
kowtow
to
his
august
lord
i
ordered
him
to
rise
and
come
aft
with
me
up
on
the
high
poop
the
pursuing
squadron
had
ceased
to
gain
on
us
as
at
the
first
most
of
the
craft
were
falling
astern
but
one
at
least
was
still
creeping
up
on
us
the
skipper
admitted
that
she
was
slightly
the
better
sailer
on
the
wind
and
that
she
carried
a
number
of
bronze
pieces
his
own
cannon
had
not
yet
been
shipped
a
few
inquiries
brought
me
the
information
that
he
had
aboard
spare
sailcloth
and
spars
within
the
minute
i
had
his
crew
rigging
jibs
and
staysails
there
was
no
time
to
cut
and
sew
canvas
the
sheets
were
knotted
and
rigged
in
a
manner
to
shame
a
marine
yet
even
the
first
jib
that
was
set
drew
enough
to
offset
the
difference
in
the
speed
of
our
foremost
pursuer
after
jibs
followed
staysails
and
last
of
all
the
junk
heeled
over
under
the
freshening
wind
and
drove
down
the
bay
at
a
speed
that
astonished
the
incoming
craft
finding
themselves
fast
falling
astern
our
pursuers
opened
fire
with
their
feeble
carronades
we
cheered
and
hauled
to
our
peak
the
first
national
flag
authorized
by
the
shogunate
a
red
ball
on
a
white
field
the
many
craft
which
we
met
or
passed
mistook
the
firing
of
our
pursuers
for
salutes
and
cheered
us
as
we
drove
by
in
our
swift
flight
within
two
hours
we
were
flying
past
the
outjutting
point
on
the
east
coast
which
had
given
yoritomo
and
me
so
much
concern
that
wild
night
in
june
we
stood
boldly
on
down
past
the
cape
above
uraga
in
the
narrower
waters
of
the
bay
between
us
and
cape
sagami
government
sculled
to
and
fro
in
vigilant
patrol
we
drove
on
past
uraga
without
putting
in
as
the
regulations
required
signalled
to
they
sculled
swiftly
athwart
our
course
signalling
for
us
to
lay
to
some
we
slipped
past
others
backed
water
to
escape
being
run
down
firing
at
us
with
their
ineffective
swivels
two
managed
to
strike
in
alongside
but
we
cut
loose
their
before
their
crews
could
board
us
by
we
cleared
the
last
of
the
off
cape
sagami
before
us
opened
the
broad
gulf
of
the
outer
bay
beyond
which
rolled
the
illimitable
expanse
of
the
pacific
the
broad
lap
of
freedom
we
had
won
our
way
out
of
the
clutches
of
mito
i
set
our
course
between
the
smoking
mass
of
vries
island
and
the
distant
coast
of
idzu
and
ordered
the
struck
we
had
now
only
to
coast
down
hondo
and
shikoku
and
kyushu
to
cape
satanomi
before
the
steady
drive
of
the
northeast
monsoon
a
rough
voyage
against
the
japan
current
in
any
craft
yet
one
fairly
safe
at
this
season
even
for
our
unwieldy
junk
the
typhoon
season
was
past
i
went
down
into
the
cabin
where
mats
had
been
laid
and
silk
drapes
hung
for
the
son
of
owari
there
alone
in
the
largest
room
i
found
the
daughter
waiting
to
salute
and
serve
her
lord
she
kowtowed
before
me
her
forehead
upon
her
tiny
hands
i
bent
and
caught
her
up
in
my
arms
and
pressed
my
lips
upon
her
little
mouth
after
the
manner
of
the
chapter
xxxiv
conclusion
the
last
page
of
my
narrative
is
finished
i
lay
it
aside
with
the
others
and
gaze
out
through
the
open
balcony
of
my
tower
room
upon
the
majestically
beautiful
stretch
of
kagoshima
bay
from
this
pagoda
eyrie
i
can
look
with
equal
ease
down
the
blue
gulf
and
upon
the
gray
roofs
of
the
city
beneath
the
castle
height
there
in
the
mouth
of
the
inlet
off
the
volcanic
island
in
the
head
of
the
bay
is
the
anchorage
where
the
lay
that
eventful
night
for
fate
to
send
me
my
brother
yoritomo
my
thoughts
wander
from
the
classroom
below
me
where
as
honorable
and
honored
teacher
of
the
learning
i
instruct
the
young
of
my
great
friend
satsuma
i
pass
in
rapid
review
those
eventful
months
in
yedo
i
recall
the
sacrifice
of
my
dear
friend
and
rejoice
to
know
that
the
years
promise
a
maturing
of
good
fruit
from
the
seed
sown
by
his
spirit
and
watered
with
his
blood
i
recall
how
even
mito
and
the
cautious
abe
were
forced
to
accept
the
treaty
they
abhorred
by
the
menace
of
black
ships
in
the
spring
of
the
brother
of
the
sweetest
woman
on
earth
or
in
heaven
still
sits
on
the
stool
of
the
shogun
but
now
ii
the
great
elder
holds
the
place
of
abe
and
seconds
the
efforts
of
the
wise
first
consul
to
japan
the
american
townsend
harris
word
has
come
that
the
treaty
for
the
opening
of
ports
to
commerce
and
intercourse
will
be
signed
the
shogunate
and
feudalism
verge
towards
their
inevitable
fall
but
the
truth
must
penetrate
to
the
ears
of
our
sacred
mikado
through
the
barriers
of
ignorance
and
prejudice
i
see
a
new
japan
a
hand
touches
my
arm
with
the
lightness
of
a
perching
butterfly
i
turn
and
draw
to
me
my
wife
the
daughter
and
press
my
lips
upon
her
coral
mouth
so
much
i
have
retained
of
my
manners
she
withdraws
her
soft
arms
from
about
my
neck
and
glides
back
to
kneel
before
her
lord
and
clap
her
hands
gently
there
is
no
responsive
but
through
the
entrance
floats
a
graceful
woman
bearing
a
baby
girl
little
azai
is
handed
to
her
mother
while
kohana
san
smiles
the
greeting
she
can
not
speak
and
kowtows
to
the
master
a
sturdy
boy
of
four
rushes
in
to
fling
himself
down
before
his
august
father
in
the
required
salute
but
there
is
a
light
not
altogether
nipponese
in
his
lustrous
black
eyes
as
he
springs
up
to
tell
of
his
war
game
with
his
playmates
in
the
castle
garden
and
o
setsu
san
she
still
attends
upon
the
daughter
when
not
serving
her
lord
and
husband
the
swordmaster
of
kagoshima

known
as

his
quaint
and
dainty

for
a
time
i
called

and

from
them
i
have
been
cut
off
as
from
the
dead

far
from
yedo

even
shimadzu

of

dare
not
whisper
abroad
the

of
my

and

in
the
capital
of
my
august

and
in

the

dwells
in
the

in
