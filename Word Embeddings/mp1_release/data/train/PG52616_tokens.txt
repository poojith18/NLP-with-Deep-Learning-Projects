chapter
paul
the
telegraph
boy
on
broadway
not
far
from
the
nicholas
hotel
is
an
office
of
the
american
district
telegraph
let
us
enter
a
part
of
the
office
is
railed
off
within
which
the
superintendent
has
a
desk
and
receives
orders
for
boys
to
be
sent
to
different
parts
of
the
city
on
benches
in
the
back
part
of
the
office
are
sitting
perhaps
a
dozen
boys
varying
in
age
from
fifteen
to
eighteen
clad
in
the
well
known
blue
uniform
prescribed
by
the
company
each
wears
a
cap
on
which
may
be
read
the
initials
of
the
company
with
the
number
at
the
end
of
the
benches
sat
a
stout
well
made
boy
apparently
sixteen
years
of
age
he
had
a
warm
expressive
face
and
would
generally
be
considered
good
looking
on
his
cap
we
read
this
inscription
some
of
the
boys
were
smaller
two
or
three
larger
than
number
but
among
them
all
he
was
the
most
attractive
in
appearance
the
boys
sat
on
the
benches
in
patience
waiting
for
a
call
from
the
superintendent
they
were
usually
selected
in
turn
but
sometimes
the
fitness
of
a
particular
boy
for
the
errand
required
was
taken
into
consideration
called
the
superintendent
a
small
boy
of
fifteen
but
not
looking
over
thirteen
left
his
seat
and
advanced
to
the
desk
i
think
do
said
the
superintendent
a
man
at
the
new
england
hotel
who
wants
a
boy
to
go
down
with
him
to
the
cortlandt
street
ferry
and
carry
his
valise
a
larger
boy
will
be
he
glanced
at
the
boys
in
waiting
and
called
the
boy
of
whom
we
have
spoken
rose
with
alacrity
and
stepped
up
to
the
desk
he
had
been
sitting
on
the
bench
for
an
hour
and
was
glad
of
an
opportunity
to
go
out
on
an
errand
the
superintendent
wrote
on
a
card
the
name
meacham
new
england
hotel
and
handed
it
to
the
boy
at
once
to
the
new
england
hotel
and
call
for
that
gentleman
he
said
he
is
not
in
wait
for
paul
parton
for
this
was
his
name
did
not
need
any
further
directions
he
was
perfectly
acquainted
with
the
city
especially
in
the
lower
part
where
he
had
lived
for
years
he
crossed
broadway
and
taking
an
easterly
course
made
his
way
to
the
bowery
on
which
at
the
corner
of
bayard
street
the
new
england
hotel
stands
this
is
a
very
respectable
inn
and
by
its
fair
accommodations
and
moderate
prices
attracts
a
large
number
of
patrons
entering
paul
advanced
to
the
desk
meacham
in
he
asked
referring
to
the
card
given
him
by
the
superintendent
he
is
replied
not
the
clerk
to
whom
the
question
was
addressed
but
a
tall
elderly
man
with
gray
hair
clad
in
a
rusty
suit
evidently
a
gentleman
from
the
rural
districts
you
the
telegraph
boy
he
asked
want
to
go
down
to
the
ferry
to
take
the
train
to
right
sir
is
this
your
valise
asked
paul
pointing
to
a
shabby
traveling
bag
that
might
from
its
appearance
have
been
used
by
noah
when
he
was
on
board
the
ark
you
want
to
start
now
meacham
i
might
as
well
i
got
nothing
to
keep
me
here
how
fur
is
it
a
mile
perhaps
a
little
paul
took
the
valise
in
his
hand
and
went
out
of
the
hotel
followed
by
the
old
man
you
know
the
way
all
round
here
sonny
he
asked
it
beats
me
i
get
turned
round
and
know
where
i
am
if
it
for
that
i
could
have
gone
to
the
ferry
alone
but
sake
i
might
wander
all
round
till
tomorrow
morning
without
finding
i
guess
better
to
have
a
boy
with
you
said
paul
laughingly
look
like
a
smart
boy
said
the
old
man
attentively
examining
number
you
like
your
business
well
answered
paul
the
pay
pretty
good
get
four
dollars
a
more
than
i
got
when
i
was
your
age
go
very
far
in
the
city
when
you
have
your
board
and
clothes
to
pay
for
replied
the
young
telegraph
messenger
so
i
think
of
that
i
was
reared
on
a
farm
where
they
make
much
account
of
the
victuals
you
have
to
make
account
of
it
here
you
have
much
left
out
of
your
four
dollars
sir
but
i
get
rather
more
than
four
dollars
sometimes
the
gentlemen
i
am
working
for
give
me
a
little
extra
for
much
does
that
come
to
in
a
week
sometimes
i
make
a
dollar
or
two
extra
it
depends
a
good
deal
on
whether
i
fall
in
with
liberal
gentlemen
or
not
i
mean
this
as
a
hint
sir
added
paul
smiling
am
not
entitled
to
anything
extra
but
of
course
when
it
is
offered
i
take
paul
had
a
motive
in
saying
this
he
abhorred
the
idea
of
seeming
to
beg
for
a
gratuity
besides
judging
from
the
appearance
and
rusty
attire
of
the
old
man
he
decided
that
he
was
poor
and
could
not
afford
to
pay
anything
over
the
regular
charges
see
said
the
old
farmer
as
paul
supposed
him
to
be
with
a
responsive
smile
right
there
sonny
if
offered
a
little
extra
money
all
right
to
take
by
this
time
they
had
reached
the
city
hall
park
and
were
crossing
it
then
as
now
the
park
swarmed
with
bootblacks
of
all
sizes
provided
with
the
implements
of
their
trade
frequently
in
the
rivalry
which
results
from
active
competition
the
little
fellows
are
pushed
aside
and
the
bigger
and
stronger
boys
take
possession
of
the
customers
they
have
secured
there
was
a
case
of
this
sort
which
fell
under
the
attention
of
paul
and
his
elderly
companion
a
pale
delicate
looking
boy
of
twelve
was
signaled
by
a
gentleman
a
rod
or
two
from
the
city
hall
he
hastened
eagerly
to
secure
a
job
but
unhappily
the
signal
had
also
been
seen
by
a
bigger
boy
larger
if
anything
than
paul
and
he
too
ran
to
get
in
ahead
of
the
smaller
boy
without
ceremony
he
put
out
his
foot
and
tripped
little
jack
and
with
a
triumphant
laugh
sped
on
to
the
expectant
customer
the
little
boy
who
had
been
bruised
by
the
fall
rose
crying
and
disappointed
mean
tom
rafferty
he
said
gentleman
called
tom
only
responded
by
another
laugh
with
him
might
made
right
and
the
dominating
law
was
the
will
of
the
stronger
get
another
soon
he
said
he
got
down
on
his
knees
and
placed
his
box
in
position
but
all
was
not
to
be
as
smooth
sailing
as
he
expected
paul
with
a
blaze
of
honest
indignation
had
seen
the
outrage
he
was
not
surprised
for
he
knew
both
boys
mind
jack
he
said
fix
it
all
right
mind
the
valise
a
minute
sir
he
added
and
rather
to
the
surprise
of
meacham
he
left
him
standing
in
the
park
while
he
darted
forward
seized
tom
rafferty
by
the
collar
pulled
him
over
backwards
and
called
jack
the
little
boy
emboldened
by
this
unexpected
help
ran
up
and
took
place
at
the
foot
of
the
customer
the
boy
you
called
sir
he
said
true
my
boy
go
ahead
only
be
quick
said
the
gentleman
tom
rafferty
was
furious
you
know
any
better
you
overgrown
bully
than
to
get
away
little
jobs
asked
paul
indignantly
mash
yer
roared
tom
mean
if
you
can
said
the
undaunted
paul
think
a
gentleman
just
because
a
telegraph
boy
i
could
be
a
telegraph
boy
myself
if
i
wanted
ahead
i
have
no
give
that
little
kid
the
worst
he
ever
had
soon
as
he
gets
through
see
ef
i
it
if
you
dare
said
paul
his
eyes
flashing
you
do
thrash
what
i
say
tom
rafferty
now
meacham
go
on
i
hope
excuse
me
for
keeping
you
i
will
sonny
it
did
me
good
to
see
you
pitching
into
that
young
bully
like
to
have
done
it
know
both
boys
sir
little
jack
is
the
son
of
a
widow
who
sews
for
a
living
and
she
make
enough
to
support
the
family
and
he
has
to
go
out
and
earn
what
he
can
by
shines
he
is
small
and
weak
and
the
big
boys
impose
upon
glad
he
has
some
friends
number
a
brave
know
about
that
sir
but
i
stand
still
and
see
a
little
kid
like
that
imposed
upon
by
a
big
brute
like
tom
they
crossed
broadway
and
presently
neared
cortlandt
street
just
at
the
corner
stood
an
old
man
with
bent
form
and
white
hair
dressed
with
extreme
shabbiness
his
hand
was
extended
and
he
was
silently
asking
for
alms
cheek
flushed
and
an
expression
of
mortification
swept
over
his
face
he
said
reproachfully
go
home
beg
in
the
streets
you
make
me
ashamed
chapter
ii
the
cortlandt
street
ferry
the
old
man
turned
and
recognizing
paul
looked
somewhat
ashamed
i
help
it
he
whined
so
is
no
need
for
you
to
beg
bring
you
some
money
for
a
little
while
see
a
kind
gentleman
gave
me
that
and
he
displayed
a
silver
dime
paul
looked
very
much
annoyed
you
stop
begging
grandfather
he
said
come
home
at
all
go
and
sleep
at
the
the
old
man
looked
frightened
paul
turned
in
every
week
two
dollars
and
a
half
of
his
wages
and
old
jerry
had
no
wish
to
lose
so
considerable
a
sum
go
go
right
away
he
said
hastily
sure
you
do
if
you
i
shall
hear
of
it
and
you
see
me
any
just
then
a
policeman
of
the
broadway
squad
whose
business
it
was
to
pilot
passengers
across
through
the
maze
of
vehicles
took
the
old
man
in
tow
and
led
him
carefully
across
the
great
thoroughfare
meacham
had
watched
in
attentive
silence
this
interview
between
paul
and
the
old
man
that
is
your
grandfather
he
said
call
him
so
answered
paul
slowly
call
him
so
repeated
his
companion
puzzled
he
really
your
grandfather
sir
but
as
i
have
lived
with
him
ever
since
i
was
very
small
i
have
got
into
the
habit
of
calling
him
did
your
father
die
i
was
about
six
years
old
he
only
left
a
hundred
dollars
or
so
which
jerry
took
charge
of
and
took
me
to
live
with
him
we
were
living
in
the
same
tenement
house
and
how
it
came
he
so
very
poor
used
to
think
so
answered
paul
one
day
i
found
out
that
he
got
a
monthly
pension
from
some
quarter
in
the
city
i
know
how
much
it
is
but
i
know
he
has
money
deposited
in
the
bowery
savings
did
you
find
that
out
number
was
walking
along
the
bowery
one
day
on
an
errand
when
as
i
was
passing
the
bank
i
saw
grandfather
going
up
the
steps
that
made
me
curious
and
i
beckoned
to
a
friend
of
mine
johnny
woods
and
asked
him
to
go
in
and
see
what
the
old
business
appeared
to
be
i
met
johnny
that
evening
and
he
told
me
that
he
saw
grandfather
write
out
a
deposit
check
and
pay
in
money
i
find
out
how
much
it
was
but
johnny
said
there
were
several
bills
in
the
your
grandfather
as
you
call
him
is
a
sir
about
what
it
comes
what
way
does
he
live
have
a
poor
miserable
room
in
a
tenement
on
pearl
street
that
costs
us
four
dollars
a
month
grandfather
is
always
groaning
about
having
to
pay
so
suppose
he
live
very
luxuriously
bread
and
sometimes
a
little
cheese
is
what
he
lives
on
sometimes
an
irish
washerwoman
living
in
the
room
below
brings
up
a
plate
of
meat
out
of
paul
uttered
the
last
word
bitterly
as
if
he
felt
keenly
the
mortification
of
the
confession
how
can
you
look
so
well
and
strong
on
such
fare
asked
the
old
farmer
gazing
not
unadmiringly
at
the
red
cheeks
and
healthy
complexion
of
the
young
telegraph
boy
take
my
meals
with
grandfather
he
wanted
me
to
hand
in
all
my
money
and
share
his
meals
but
i
told
him
i
should
die
in
a
week
if
i
had
to
live
like
him
so
he
agreed
to
let
me
pay
him
two
dollars
and
a
half
a
week
and
use
the
rest
for
myself
i
generally
eat
at
some
restaurant
on
the
that
must
cost
you
more
than
a
dollar
and
a
half
a
it
does
sir
but
i
get
a
dollar
or
two
extra
on
fees
from
parties
that
employ
then
at
the
prices
i
paid
at
the
new
england
hotel
i
think
you
could
buy
three
meals
a
do
you
take
me
for
meacham
a
vanderbilt
or
an
astor
asked
paul
smiling
might
as
well
go
to
or
the
fifth
avenue
hotel
as
to
the
new
england
do
you
eat
then
at
the
jim
fisk
restaurant
on
chatham
that
a
cheap
restaurant
can
get
a
good
breakfast
there
for
eight
cents
and
a
good
dinner
for
meacham
looked
surprised
on
earth
can
you
get
for
those
prices
he
asked
can
get
a
cup
of
coffee
eggs
fish
balls
or
mutton
stew
with
bread
and
butter
for
eight
cents
said
paul
coffee
costs
three
cents
the
other
five
then
for
dinner
all
kinds
of
meat
cost
eight
cents
a
plate
and
bread
and
butter
thrown
cheap
enough
certainly
is
it
good
do
said
paul
briefly
sunday
i
got
roast
turkey
that
cost
twelve
scott
ejaculated
the
farmer
never
dreamed
of
how
people
live
here
in
this
great
see
we
all
of
us
eat
at
your
grandfather
ever
eat
at
your
restaurant
i
invited
him
and
told
him
i
would
pay
the
bill
he
ate
a
square
meal
meat
coffee
and
pie
costing
sixteen
cents
he
seemed
to
relish
it
very
much
but
when
we
were
going
away
he
groaned
over
my
extravagance
and
predicted
that
i
would
die
in
the
poorhouse
never
succeeded
in
getting
him
there
well
said
the
farmer
all
the
fools
on
the
footstool
i
believe
the
biggest
is
the
man
who
deprives
himself
of
vittles
to
save
up
money
for
somebody
else
to
spend
too
selfish
for
my
a
day
that
grandfather
groan
over
my
foolish
extravagance
continued
paul
it
makes
me
laugh
but
oftener
it
makes
me
feel
much
attachment
to
him
then
sir
perhaps
i
ought
as
he
has
been
my
guardian
so
long
but
you
saw
him
yourself
sir
a
poor
shabby
dirty
old
man
how
can
i
feel
attached
to
him
confess
it
must
be
think
me
much
to
blame
do
you
think
you
to
blame
at
all
affection
must
be
natural
and
there
seems
to
be
no
ground
for
it
in
this
case
but
that
the
ferry
they
crossed
the
street
and
entered
the
ticket
office
of
the
cortlandt
street
ferry
paul
set
down
the
valise
while
meacham
secured
a
ticket
number
said
the
old
man
much
do
i
owe
you
paul
stated
the
sum
and
meacham
put
it
in
his
hand
you
sir
said
paul
touching
his
cap
a
minute
here
is
something
for
yourself
said
his
companion
taking
out
a
silver
dollar
from
his
purse
paul
regarded
the
old
man
with
undisguised
amazement
you
surprised
to
get
so
much
asked
the
old
man
with
a
smile
sir
i
and
he
hesitated
thought
me
a
poor
man
perhaps
a
mean
man
sir
not
that
but
i
thought
you
not
always
judge
by
the
clothes
a
man
wears
number
i
own
a
large
farm
and
fifty
thousand
dollars
in
railroad
stocks
that
is
rich
for
the
often
get
so
much
as
this
suppose
not
but
i
have
got
a
good
deal
of
information
out
of
you
i
have
heard
much
that
surprised
me
that
i
have
learned

paul
thanked
him
with
a
smile
and
turned
to
leave
the
ferry
in
the
waiting
room
was
a
tall
bearded
man
who
looked
something
like
a
miner
as
indeed
he
was
just
returned
from
a
long
sojourn
in
california
me
boy
he
said
advancing
towards
our
hero

answered
the
telegraph

with
a
glance
of
surprise

in
california
that
i
know
of
strange
said
the
miner
reflectively
is
strange
sir

the
living
image
of
a
man
i
used
to
know
a
dozen
or
fourteen
years
since
in
california
were
you
born
in
new
york
think
so
sir
i
your
father
living
sir
i
live
with
an
old
man
who
is
not
related
to
your
father
ever
in
california
may
have
been
sir
but
i
was
so
young
when

california
miners

rather
unceremonious
i
suppose
you
think
it
strange
sir
not
at
all
returned
paul
politely
am
glad
to
have
made
your
as
he
left
the
ferry
and
lost
sight
of
his
questioner
he
regretted
that
he
had
not
at
least
inquired
his
name
may
have
known
my
father
thought
paul
i
should
be
glad
to
meet
some
of
his
friends
i
think
old
jerry
knows
much
about
him
i
am
getting
tired
of
living
with
the
old

and
should
like
to
meet

old
jerry
the
miser
at
six
every
other
day
paul
was
let
off
from
the
office
other
days
he
stayed
much
later
on
this
particular
day
he
was
dismissed
at
six
and
bent
his
steps
homeward
he
paused
in
front
of
a
tall
shabby
brick
tenement
house
unsightly
in
its
surroundings
and
abounding
inside
in
unsavory
smells
and
took
his
way
up
the
creaking
staircase
to
a
room
on
the
fourth
floor
he
opened
the
door
and
entered
the
room
was
bare
and
cheerless
in
the
extreme
the
floor
was
uncarpeted
and
if
it
had
ever
been
painted
it
retained
no
vestiges
of
it
two
chairs
one
broken
a
small
table
which
would
have
been
dear
at
fifty
cents
a
low
bedstead
in
one
corner
with
a
dirty
covering
there
were
no
sheets
and
a
small
cot
bed
which
paul
occupied
these
were
about
all
that
could
claim
the
name
of
furniture
there
was
however
a
wooden
chest
originally
a
probably
which
the
telegraph
boy
used
to
hold
the
few
extra
clothes
he
possessed
old
jerry
was
sitting
on
one
side
of
the
bedstead
evening
grandfather
said
paul
cheerfully
a
good
answered
the
old
man
querulously
i
made
a
cent
thought
you
got
ten
cents
by
begging
said
paul
i
forgot
that
i
might
have
got
more
if
you
interfered
you
are
very
hard
on
your
poor
old
grandfather
bear
to
have
you
beg
said
paul
his
brows
contracting
want
to
have
it
said
that
i
live
with
a
my
fault
that
i
am
very
poor
you
so
very
poor
asked
paul
pointedly
of
course
i
am
what
do
you
mean
paul
asked
the
old
man
his
manner
indicating
alarm
you
i
am
very
poor
know
you
say
course
i
am
did
any
one
ever
tell
you
i
room
looks
like
it
at
any
rate
answered
paul
looking
about
with
ill
concealed
disgust
he
choose
to
say
anything
of
the
discovery
he
had
made
through
his
friend
johnny
woods
of
old
deposit
in
the
bowery
savings
bank
yes
and
it
is
more
than
i
can
afford
four
dollars
a
month
is
an
awful
price
i
have
often
thought
i
must
find
a
cheaper
easily
find
a
poorer
one
said
paul
moodily
grandfather
have
you
had
your
supper
i
have
eaten
a
piece
of
enough
for
you
grandfather
if
you
will
come
out
with
me
i
will
get
you
some
supper
at
the
jim
fisk
no
paul
i
afford
it
it
is
sinful
can
get
you
a
cup
of
tea
and
some
corn
beef
hash
for
eight
cents
that
much
you
think
you
would
enjoy
a
cup
of
tea
paul
it
would
do
me
good
if
i
could
afford
i
will
pay
for
paul
you
will
die
in
the
poorhouse
if
you
are
so
wasteful
the
money
that
you
have
spent
at
that
eating
house
would
bring
joy
to
the
heart
of
your
old
here
said
paul
who
could
not
bring
his
mind
to
calling
the
old
man
grandfather
as
he
had
often
done
before
no
use
talking
you
may
starve
yourself
if
you
want
to
but
i
mean
to
going
out
to
supper
now
if
you
go
with
me
pay
for
your
supper
and
it
cost
you
a
cent
i
am
sure
you
would
like
a
good
cup
of
for
an
instant
an
expression
of
longing
crept
over
the
face
of
the
old
miser
but
it
was
soon
succeeded
by
a
look
of
cunning
and
greed
would
cost
eight
cents
it
paul
he
said
but
that
much
if
like
a
plate
of
roast
beef
and
a
cup
of
tea
buy
it
for
you
they
will
cost
only
eleven
cents
so
put
on
your
hat
and
we
will
go
out
a
minute
paul
said
the
old
man
you
mind
giving
me
the
money
instead
eleven
cents
i
mind
but
i
would
rather
you
would
go
out
with
me
how
do
you
expect
to
keep
soul
and
body
together
without
anything
but
dry
bread
and
cold
water
so
poor
paul
i
afford
anything
better
whined
old
jerry
see
no
use
talking
to
you
said
paul
in
a
vexed
tone
if
you
prefer
to
have
me
give
you
the
money
here
it
he
took
from
his
pocket
a
dime
and
a
penny
and
passed
it
over
to
the
old
man
old
jerry
chuckled
and
a
smile
crept
over
his
wrinkled
features
as
he
eagerly
clutched
the
coins
boy
paul
he
said
right
to
be
kind
to
your
poor
old
going
out
to
supper
said
paul
abruptly
for
it
was
painful
to
him
to
witness
this
evidence
of
the
old
infatuation
be
back
soon
a
guardian
to
be
proud
of
he
said
bitterly
as
he
made
his
way
carefully
down
the
rickety
staircase
can
blame
me
for
not
liking
him
i
believe
i
can
make
up
my
mind
to
call
him
grandfather
again
after
all
why
should
i
he
is
no
relation
of
mine
and
i
am
glad
of
chapter
iv
a
strange
commission
the
life
of
a
telegraph
boy
is
full
of
variety
and
excitement
he
never
knows
when
he
goes
to
the
office
in
the
morning
on
what
errands
he
may
be
sent
or
what
duties
he
may
be
called
upon
to
discharge
he
may
be
sent
to
brooklyn
or
jersey
city
with
a
message
sometimes
even
farther
away
he
may
be
detained
to
supply
the
place
of
an
absent
office
boy
or
sent
up
town
to
go
out
and
walk
with
a
child
in
the
evening
he
may
be
directed
to
accompany
a
lady
to
the
theater
as
escort
these
are
a
few
of
the
uses
to
which
telegraph
messenger
boys
are
put
of
course
paul
had
had
his
share
of
varied
commissions
but
the
day
after
that
on
which
our
story
opens
a
new
duty
awaited
him
it
was
about
five
that
the
superintendent
called
sir
answered
paul
promptly
are
to
go
up
to
no
west
fifty
first
street
to
spend
the
paul
looked
surprised
spend
the
night
he
repeated
the
head
of
the
household
has
been
called
away
for
a
day
or
two
and
there
is
no
man
in
the
house
cunningham
is
timid
and
has
sent
for
a
boy
to
protect
the
house
against
possible
the
superintendent
smiled
and
so
did
paul
guess
i
can
do
it
he
said
well
you
will
report
at
the
house
about
seven
i
go
home
and
tell
grandfather
he
might
be
alarmed
if
i
come
i
will
give
you
an
extra
half
hour
for
at
seven
paul
rang
the
bell
of
a
handsome
brown
stone
mansion
on
west
fifty
first
street
the
door
was
opened
by
a
servant
girl
was
sent
for
by
cunningham
said
paul
the
missis
is
expecting
you
come
right
in
paul
observed
as
he
followed
the
girl
upstairs
into
a
sitting
room
on
the
second
floor
that
the
house
was
very
handsomely
furnished
and
came
to
the
natural
conclusion
that
the
occupants
were
rich
take
a
seat
and
tell
the
missis
said
the
girl
paul
sat
down
in
a
plush
covered
arm
chair
and
looked
about
him
admiringly
wonder
how
it
must
seem
to
live
in
such
a
house
as
this
he
reflected
and
then
his
thoughts
went
back
to
the
miserable
tenement
house
in
which
he
and
his
grandfather
lived
and
he
felt
more
disgusted
with
it
than
ever
after
the
sight
of
this
splendor
his
reflections
were
interrupted
by
the
entrance
of
a
pleasant
faced
lady
you
the
boy
i
sent
for
she
asked
with
a
smile
answered
paul
respectfully
rising
as
he
spoke
suppose
you
know
why
i
want
you
proceeded
the
lady
i
was
told
there
were
only
ladies
in
the
house
and
you
wanted
a
man
to
sleep
am
afraid
you
can
hardly
be
called
a
man
said
the
lady
with
another
smile
you
are
not
a
woman
or
girl
and
i
shall
feel
safer
for
having
you
here
i
am
afraid
i
am
a
sad
coward
what
is
your
name
paul
is
a
nice
husband
has
been
called
to
washington
she
added
after
a
pause
will
be
absent
possibly
ten
nights
knowing
my
timidity
he
recommended
my
sending
for
a
messenger
boy
i
may
say
however
that
i
have
some
reason
for
alarm
two
houses
in
this
block
have
been
entered
at
night
within
a
month
besides
through
a
thieving
servant
who
was
probably
a
confederate
of
thieves
it
has
become
known
that
we
keep
some
valuables
in
a
safe
in
the
library
and
this
may
prove
a
at
this
moment
an
extremely
pretty
girl
of
fourteen
entered
the
room
and
looked
inquiringly
at
paul
said
cunningham
is
paul
parton
who
is
to
protect
and
defend
us
tonight
if
jennie
regarded
paul
with
a
smile
you
be
afraid
she
asked
miss
answered
paul
who
was
instantly
impressed
in
favor
of
the
pretty
girl
whose
acquaintance
he
was
just
making
not
easily
frightened
he
answered
different
from
mamma
and
me
we
are
regular
scarecrows
no
that
the
word
i
mean
we
are
regular
cowards
still
with
a
brave
and
strong
man
in
the
house
she
added
with
an
arch
smile
shall
feel
hope
you
will
be
said
paul
is
still
early
said
cunningham
you
had
your
supper
paul
shall
not
retire
before
ten
jennie
you
can
entertain
this
young
gentleman
if
you
right
mamma
if
i
can
that
is
if
he
hard
to
entertain
do
you
play
dominoes
paul
call
me
miss
i
mind
your
calling
me
the
two
sat
down
to
a
game
of
dominoes
and
were
soon
on
the
friendliest
possible
terms
after
a
while
seeing
a
piano
in
the
room
paul
asked
the
young
lady
if
she
played
would
you
like
to
hear
me
you
after
three
or
four
pieces
she
asked
you
sing
much
answered
paul
bashfully
me
something
you
paul
blushed
and
tried
to
excuse
himself
sing
any
but
common
songs
he
said
what
i
want
to
after
a
while
paul
mustered
courage
enough
to
sing
mine
and
another
song
which
he
had
heard
at
harry
they
were
not
classical
but
the
young
lady
seemed
to
enjoy
them
immensely
they
were
quite
unlike
what
she
had
been
accustomed
to
hear
and
perhaps
for
that
reason
she
enjoyed
them
the
more
think
you
sing
splendidly
she
said
of
course
paul
blushed
and
put
in
a
modest
disclaimer
still
he
felt
pleased
and
decided
that
jennie
cunningham
was
the
nicest
girl
he
had
ever
met
what
would
she
say
he
thought
she
could
see
the
miserable
place
i
live
in
and
the
perspiration
gathered
on
his
face
at
the
mere
thought
at
ten
cunningham
suggested
that
it
was
time
to
go
to
bed
you
will
sleep
in
a
little
bedroom
adjoining
the
library
she
said
right
with
me
and
i
will
show
you
your
it
was
a
pleasant
room
though
small
and
seemed
to
paul
the
height
of
luxury
i
leave
with
you
my
revolver
asked
the
lady
i
would
like
you
understand
the
use
of
revolvers
i
have
practiced
some
with
them
in
a
shooting
hope
there
will
be
no
occasion
to
use
it
i
think
there
will
but
it
is
best
to
be
paul
threw
himself
on
the
bed
in
his
uniform
in
order
to
be
better
prepared
to
meet
any
midnight
intruder
do
to
sleep
too
sound
he
thought
the
house
might
be
robbed
without
my
knowing
he
was
soon
fast
asleep
it
might
have
been
because
he
had
the
matter
on
his
mind
that
about
midnight
he
woke
up
a
faint
light
had
been
left
burning
in
the
chandelier
in
the
library
was
it
imagination
on
part
that
he
thought
he
heard
a
noise
in
the
adjoining
room
instantly
he
was
on
the
alert
may
be
a
burglar
he
thought
with
a
thrill
of
excitement
he
got
up
softly
reached
for
the
revolver
and
with
a
stealthy
step
advanced
to
the
door
that
opened
into
the
library
what
he
saw
was
certainly
startling
a
man
tall
and
broad
shouldered
was
on
his
knees
before
the
safe
preparing
to
open
it
are
you
doing
there
demanded
the
telegraph
boy
firmly
illustration
the
interrupted
see
page
the
man
sprang
to
his
feet
and
confronted
paul
standing
with
a
revolver
in
his
hand
pointed
in
his
direction
a
kid
he
said
contemptuously
are
you
doing
there
repeated
paul
of
yer
business
go
back
to
bed
this
house
or
i
fire
the
man
thought
of
springing
upon
the
boy
but
there
was
something
in
his
firm
tone
that
made
him
think
it
best
to
parley
a
revolver
even
in
a
hand
might
prove
formidable
to
bed
or
kill
you
said
the
burglar
with
an
ugly
frown
will
give
you
two
minutes
to
leave
this
room
and
the
house
said
paul
you
are
here
at
the
end
of
that
time
i
fire
there
was
an
expression
of
baffled
rage
on
the
face
of
the
low
browed
ruffian
as
he
stood
bending
forward
as
if
ready
to
spring
upon
the
undaunted
boy
chapter
an
exciting
interview
for
a
full
minute
paul
and
the
burglar
faced
each
other
without
either
moving
the
telegraph
boy
of
course
waited
for
some
aggressive
movement
on
the
part
of
his
opponent
in
that
case
he
would
not
hesitate
to
fire
he
felt
the
reluctance
natural
to
any
boy
of
humane
instincts
to
take
human
life
and
resolved
if
possible
only
to
disable
the
ruffian
his
heart
quickened
its
pulsations
but
in
manner
he
was
cool
cautious
and
collected
if
the
burglar
had
seen
any
symptoms
of
timidity
or
wavering
he
would
have
sprung
upon
paul
as
it
was
he
was
afraid
to
do
so
and
was
enraged
at
himself
because
he
felt
cowed
and
intimidated
by
a
boy
he
resolved
to
inspire
fear
in
paul
if
he
could
have
a
great
mind
to
kill
you
he
growled
can
play
at
that
game
said
paul
undaunted
here
you
are
making
a
fool
of
yourself
you
are
risking
your
life
for
am
only
doing
my
duty
said
paul
firmly
in
earnest
thought
the
burglar
must
try
him
on
another
tack
here
he
said
changing
his
tone
are
a
poor
boy
you
you
lower
that
weapon
and
interfere
with
me
and
i
will
make
it
worth
your
do
you
mean
asked
paul
who
however
suspected
the
meaning
mean
this
said
the
intruder
in
an
insinuating
tone
me
open
the
safe
and
make
off
with
the
contents
and
give
you
a
liberal
share
of
do
you
take
me
for
demanded
paul
indignantly
a
boy
of
course
what
do
you
care
for
the
people
in
the
house
they
are
rich
and
can
afford
to
lose
what
will
make
us
rich
let
me
know
where
you
live
and
deal
squarely
with
you
i
mean
it
all
got
to
do
is
to
go
back
to
bed
and
think
you
slept
through
and
see
me
at
all
what
do
you
say
say
no
a
thousand
times
answered
paul
boldly
may
be
poor
all
my
life
long
but
i
be
a
the
face
expressed
the
rage
he
felt
it
was
very
hard
for
him
to
resist
the
impulse
to
spring
upon
paul
but
the
resolute
mien
of
the
boy
satisfied
him
that
it
would
be
very
dangerous
refuse
then
he
said
sullenly
you
insult
me
by
your
wish
i
had
brought
a
pistol
then
you
have
dared
speak
to
me
in
that
paul
was
relieved
to
hear
this
he
had
concluded
that
the
burglar
was
unarmed
but
know
it
positively
now
he
could
dismiss
all
fear
he
said
you
going
the
burglar
eyed
our
hero
during
a
minute
of
indecision
and
decided
that
his
plan
was
a
failure
he
certainly
could
not
open
the
safe
within
range
of
a
loaded
revolver
and
should
he
attack
paul
would
not
only
risk
his
life
but
rouse
the
house
and
fall
into
the
hands
of
the
police
a
class
of
men
he
made
it
his
business
to
avoid
it
was
a
bitter
pill
to
swallow
but
he
must
submit
you
promise
not
to
shoot
if
i
agree
to
leave
the
house
you
promise
not
to
start
the
burglar
alarm
but
allow
me
to
escape
without
interference
if
you
will
agree
never
to
enter
this
house
right
promise
i
go
if
you
break
your
word
boy
wish
you
had
never
been
born
he
added
fiercely
hunt
you
night
and
day
after
i
got
out
of
jail
and
kill
you
like
a
need
not
be
afraid
i
will
keep
my
there
was
something
in
tone
and
manner
that
inspired
confidence
a
bad
sort
said
the
burglar
paying
an
involuntary
tribute
to
the
staunch
honesty
a
cool
kind
of
kid
any
way
what
an
honor
make
to
our
profession
paul
could
not
help
smiling
suppose
a
compliment
he
said
you
now
i
must
trouble
you
to
going
remember
your
promise
in
an
instant
the
burglar
was
out
of
the
window
through
which
he
had
made
his
entrance
and
disappeared
from
sight
paul
did
not
approach
the
window
lest
his
doing
so
should
excite
alarm
in
the
rogue
when
a
sufficient
time
had
elapsed
he
ran
to
the
window
closed
it
and
once
more
breathed
freely
the
danger
was
passed
and
he
began
now
to
feel
the
tension
to
which
his
nerves
had
been
subjected
anything
happened
paul
asked
a
voice
turning
paul
saw
cunningham
at
the
door
she
had
thrown
a
wrapper
over
her
and
attracted
by
the
sound
of
voices
had
entered
the
library
any
burglar
been
here
she
asked
nervously
observing
paul
with
the
revolver
in
his
hand
answered
the
telegraph
boy
have
just
bidden
the
gentleman
good
by
this
time
jennie
too
made
her
appearance
is
it
mamma
what
is
it
paul
she
asked
are
you
standing
there
with
the
revolver
in
your
hand
paul
told
the
story
as
briefly
as
the
circumstances
would
admit
was
a
mercy
you
were
awake
said
cunningham
you
hear
the
noise
of
the
entrance
know
how
i
happened
to
wake
up
said
paul
generally
sleep
sound
but
i
opened
my
eyes
and
immediately
heard
a
noise
in
this
did
you
have
time
to
dress
asked
jennie
did
not
need
to
do
so
for
i
threw
myself
on
the
bed
with
my
clothes
with
your
cap
on
inquired
jennie
with
an
arch
smile
but
when
i
rose
from
the
bed
i
put
it
on
without
thinking
i
know
whether
i
ought
to
have
let
the
burglar
get
off
free
but
i
thought
it
the
easiest
way
to
avoid
did
right
i
approve
your
conduct
said
cunningham
seem
to
have
acted
with
remarkable
courage
and
am
very
glad
if
you
are
pleased
madam
said
paul
gratified
at
this
cordial
indorsement
you
awfully
scared
paul
asked
jennie
cunningham
i
was
a
little
scared
i
admit
answered
paul
with
a
smile
i
think
it
wise
to
show
it
before
the
hand
would
have
trembled
so
that
i
hold
the
pistol
declared
the
young
lady
course
you
are
a
girl
you
you
think
girls
are
brave
then
are
not
called
upon
to
be
brave
in
the
same
good
answer
said
cunningham
now
jennie
we
had
better
go
back
to
bed
will
you
not
be
afraid
to
sleep
here
the
rest
of
the
night
after
this
adventure
she
asked
turning
to
paul
cunningham
the
burglar
feel
like
coming
that
asked
jennie
pointing
to
some
article
on
the
floor
is
the
jimmy
said
paul
stooping
to
pick
it
up
left
in
such
a
hurry
that
he
forgot
to
take
it
with
him
i
will
carry
it
into
my
room
and
take
care
of
paul
bade
the
two
visitors
good
night
and
threw
himself
once
more
on
the
bed
the
remainder
of
the
night
passed
quietly
the
midnight
visitor
did
not
reappear
chapter
vi
paul
makes
a
strange
discovery
the
next
morning
cunningham
insisted
on
taking
breakfast
with
her
before
he
returned
to
the
telegraph
office
though
it
was
a
new
experience
to
paul
sitting
down
at
a
luxuriously
furnished
table
in
a
refined
family
he
was
possessed
of
a
natural
good
breeding
which
enabled
him
to
appear
to
advantage
he
was
flattered
by
the
cordial
manner
in
which
cunningham
and
her
daughter
treated
him
and
he
was
tempted
to
ask
himself
whether
he
was
the
same
boy
that
had
lived
for
years
in
a
squalid
tenement
house
under
the
guardianship
of
a
ragged
and
miserly
old
man
being
gifted
with
a
appetite
paul
did
not
fail
to
appreciate
the
dainty
rolls
tender
meat
and
delicious
coffee
with
which
he
was
served
get
such
a
breakfast
as
this
at
the
restaurant
thought
paul
that
is
a
good
deal
better
than
i
could
get
at
am
not
sure
whether
i
shall
need
you
tonight
paul
said
cunningham
as
they
rose
from
the
breakfast
table
is
not
certain
whether
cunningham
will
be
at
home
or
be
detained
over
another
night
at
shall
be
glad
to
come
if
you
need
me
said
paul
think
i
will
have
you
come
up
at
any
rate
about
seven
said
the
lady
will
write
a
line
to
the
superintendent
to
that
well
when
paul
presented
himself
at
the
office
he
was
the
bearer
of
a
note
to
the
superintendent
that
official
showed
some
surprise
as
he
read
it
you
drove
away
a
burglar
number
he
said
believe
i
frightened
him
away
answered
paul
was
he
a
little
fellow
a
large
he
was
afraid
of
you
continued
the
superintendent
surprised
was
afraid
of
my
revolver
amended
paul
the
superintendent
asked
more
questions
being
apparently
interested
in
the
matter
lady
wishes
you
to
go
up
again
tonight
he
said
sir
so
she
told
me
but
it
is
not
certain
that
i
shall
have
to
stay
all
course
you
are
to
as
the
telegraph
office
would
receive
a
good
round
sum
for
services
the
superintendent
was
very
willing
to
send
him
up
at
noon
paul
went
home
the
tenement
house
seemed
still
more
miserable
and
squalid
as
he
clambered
up
the
rickety
staircase
he
mentally
contrasted
it
with
the
elegant
mansion
in
which
he
had
spent
the
night
and
it
disgusted
him
still
more
with
the
wretched
surroundings
of
the
place
he
called
home
he
was
about
to
open
the
door
of
old
room
when
he
was
arrested
by
the
sound
of
voices
high
pitched
and
quavering
was
familiar
enough
to
him
but
there
seemed
something
familiar
also
in
the
voice
of
the
other
and
yet
he
could
not
identify
it
with
any
of
acquaintances
there
was
a
round
hole
in
the
door
the
origin
of
which
was
uncertain
and
paul
knowing
that
he
was
at
liberty
to
enter
did
not
think
it
wrong
to
reconnoiter
through
it
before
doing
so
to
his
intense
surprise
the
face
of
the
visitor
visible
to
him
through
the
opening
was
that
of
the
burglar
whom
he
had
confronted
the
night
before
can
he
have
to
do
with
jerry
paul
asked
himself
in
bewilderment
just
then
the
man
spoke
fact
is
father
i
am
hard
pressed
and
must
have
some
amazement
increased
was
this
burglar
the
son
of
old
jerry
he
remembered
now
having
heard
jerry
refer
to
a
son
who
had
left
him
many
years
ago
and
who
had
never
since
been
heard
of
have
no
money
james
whined
the
old
man
am
poor
very
heard
that
talk
before
said
the
son
contemptuously
i
know
what
it
i
am
poor
repeated
old
jerry
eagerly
get
enough
to
eat
all
i
can
afford
is
bread
and
much
money
have
you
got
in
the
bank
asked
james
what
makes
you
ask
that
asked
the
old
man
in
an
agitated
voice
i
have
hit
the
nail
on
the
head
said
the
visitor
with
an
unpleasant
laugh
see
how
poor
i
am
said
the
old
man
this
poor
room
look
as
if
i
had
money
it
but
i
know
you
of
old
father
i
suppose
you
are
the
same
old
miser
you
used
to
be
i
wonder
if
you
could
raise
thousands
of
dollars
if
you
him
talk
ejaculated
the
old
man
raising
his
feeble
arm
in
despairing
protest
i
got
any
money
except
a
few
cents
that
paul
brought
me
who
is
paul
asked
the
son
quickly
is
a
boy
i
took
years
ago
when
he
was
very
small
i
i
took
him
out
of
likely
so
like
you
sneered
the
son
warrant
you
have
got
more
out
of
him
than
he
cost
this
was
true
enough
as
paul
could
testify
he
was
only
six
when
he
came
under
the
old
care
but
even
at
that
tender
age
he
was
sent
out
on
the
street
to
sell
papers
and
matches
and
old
jerry
tried
to
induce
him
to
beg
but
that
was
something
the
boy
had
always
steadfastly
refused
to
do
he
had
an
independent
self
respecting
spirit
which
made
him
ashamed
to
beg
he
was
always
willing
to
work
and
to
work
hard
and
he
generally
had
an
opportunity
to
do
so
this
will
relieve
paul
from
the
charge
of
ingratitude
for
he
had
always
paid
his
own
way
and
really
owed
jerry
nothing
he
has
cost
me
a
great
deal
whined
jerry
i
knew
his
father
and
i
could
not
turn
him
out
into
the
how
old
is
this
boy
now
asked
the
son
i
think
he
is
about
ought
to
be
able
to
earn
something
what
does
he
do
is
a
telegraph
exclaimed
the
burglar
with
a
scowl
for
the
word
provoked
disagreeable
memories
of
the
previous
night
hate
telegraph
is
a
good
boy
a
pretty
good
boy
but
he
eats
a
the
son
indulged
in
a
short
laugh
does
he
like
your
boarding
house
he
asked
eat
here
he
goes
to
a
restaurant
he
spends
piles
of
money
groaned
the
old
man
boys
are
not
generally
supposed
to
revel
in
riches
said
the
son
in
a
sarcastic
tone
so
much
out
of
your
pocket
eh
groaned
the
old
man
he
would
give
me
all
his
wages
i
should
be
very
he
from
what
i
know
of
your
table
father
i
think
he
would
starve
to
death
in
a
month
i
forgotten
how
you
starved
me
when
i
was
a
look
strong
and
well
now
said
old
jerry
but
no
thanks
to
you
but
to
business
how
much
money
have
you
got
little
james
i
have
eleven
cents
that
paul
gave
me
you
are
deceiving
me
where
is
your
bank
book
have
none
what
makes
you
ask
such
questions
demanded
the
old
man
querulously
wish
you
would
go
is
a
pretty
way
to
treat
a
son
you
seen
for
twelve
years
do
you
know
what
i
am
tell
you
for
years
i
have
been
a
old
jerry
looked
frightened
not
in
earnest
james
i
am
i
proud
of
the
business
but
you
drove
me
to
no
protested
the
old
man
made
me
work
hard
and
half
starved
me
when
i
was
a
boy
you
gave
me
no
chance
of
education
and
all
to
swell
your
paltry
hoards
if
i
have
gone
to
the
bad
you
are
responsible
but
let
that
drop
been
unfortunate
and
i
want
told
you
i
had
none
i
believe
you
hark
you
i
will
come
back
tomorrow
he
said
with
a
threatening
gesture
the
meanwhile
get
fifty
dollars
from
the
bank
and
have
it
ready
for
me
do
you
hear
must
be
mad
james
said
old
jerry
regarding
his
son
with
a
look
of
fear
shall
be
unless
you
have
the
money
i
will
go
now
but
i
shall
be
back
paul
ran
downstairs
hastily
as
he
heard
the
heavy
step
approaching
the
door
he
care
to
be
recognized
by
his
unpleasant
acquaintance
of
the
night
previous
chapter
vii
paul
resolves
to
move
after
unwelcome
visitor
was
well
out
of
the
way
paul
returned
to
the
room
he
found
old
jerry
trembling
and
very
much
distressed
the
old
man
looked
up
with
startled
eyes
when
he
opened
the
door
you
paul
he
said
in
a
tone
of
relief
did
you
think
it
was
asked
paul
wishing
to
draw
out
the
old
man
i
have
had
a
visit
from
a
bad
man
who
wanted
to
rob
was
it
tell
you
paul
but
a
secret
mind
it
was
my
know
you
had
a
i
thought
he
might
be
dead
for
i
have
not
seen
him
for
twenty
years
i
am
afraid
he
is
very
did
he
find
you
out
know
he
he
frightened
me
very
much
he
wanted
me
to
give
him
money
and
i
so
miserably
paul
answer
know
how
poor
i
am
paul
continued
the
old
man
appealingly
always
say
so
the
old
man
did
not
appear
to
notice
that
paul
had
ceased
to
call
him
grandfather
true
of
course
true
but
he
wants
me
to
pay
him
fifty
dollars
he
is
coming
back
he
get
it
if
you
it
to
i
know
he
was
always
bad
tempered
james
was
i
am
afraid
he
might
beat
beat
his
father
exclaimed
paul
indignantly
might
said
the
old
man
a
good
boy
like
you
he
always
gave
me
you
really
afraid
he
will
come
grand
jerry
asked
paul
earnestly
he
is
sure
to
come
he
said
i
think
we
had
better
move
to
another
place
where
he
find
yes
let
us
go
said
the
old
man
hurriedly
but
he
added
with
a
sudden
thought
have
paid
the
rent
here
to
the
end
of
the
month
i
afford
to
lose
that
i
am
so
will
only
be
a
dollar
and
a
half
i
will
pay
it
said
paul
i
think
i
shall
go
when
shall
we
leave
paul
evening
jerry
if
i
can
get
the
time
i
may
have
to
stay
up
town
to
guard
a
house
where
the
gentleman
is
absent
but
it
certain
if
i
do
i
will
be
here
early
in
the
morning
before
i
go
to
this
assurance
seemed
to
abate
the
apprehensions
of
the
old
man
who
it
was
evident
stood
in
great
fear
of
his
son
paul
was
obliged
to
take
a
hurried
leave
of
him
in
order
to
have
time
for
lunch
before
returning
to
the
office
would
have
dreamed
he
said
to
himself
the
bold
burglar
whom
i
encountered
last
night
was
the
son
of
old
jerry
one
is
as
timid
as
a
mouse
the
other
seems
like
a
daring
criminal
i
wonder
why
jerry
never
told
me
that
he
had
a
the
discovery
that
jerry
had
such
a
son
made
paul
still
more
unwilling
to
own
a
relationship
to
him
it
was
bad
enough
to
pass
for
the
grandson
of
a
squalid
miser
but
it
was
worse
to
be
thought
the
son
or
nephew
of
a
burglar
the
day
passed
quietly
paul
was
not
sent
out
much
on
the
supposition
that
he
might
have
to
pass
another
night
at
the
house
of
cunningham
about
seven
he
rang
the
bell
of
the
house
in
fifty
first
street
the
same
servant
admitted
him
this
time
she
received
him
with
a
smile
knowing
that
he
stood
high
with
her
mistress
right
in
she
said
mistress
will
see
you
in
the
sitting
you
had
any
more
visits
from
burglars
asked
paul
may
be
waiting
till
cunningham
got
back
but
expected
at
paul
was
glad
to
hear
this
for
he
preferred
not
to
remain
over
night
as
he
knew
that
old
jerry
would
need
him
when
paul
entered
the
sitting
room
cunningham
received
him
cordially
suppose
you
have
not
seen
the
burglar
since
said
cunningham
innocently
she
little
dreamed
what
a
discovery
he
had
made
and
he
did
not
think
it
wise
to
enlighten
her
has
not
called
upon
me
answered
paul
with
justifiable
evasion
think
i
want
to
meet
him
hope
he
will
never
present
himself
here
said
the
lady
made
me
a
promise
that
he
would
not
said
paul
suppose
he
mind
breaking
but
he
may
conclude
that
you
would
be
on
your
is
something
in
that
said
cunningham
looking
relieved
husband
has
telegraphed
me
that
he
will
be
here
at
eight
but
i
want
him
to
run
the
risk
of
encountering
such
a
you
need
me
to
remain
here
but
i
wish
you
to
stay
till
cunningham
returns
he
will
wish
to
see
if
you
desire
it
said
paul
politely
daughter
will
entertain
you
continued
the
lady
she
evening
paul
said
jennie
cordially
extending
her
hand
as
she
entered
the
room
evening
responded
paul
brightening
up
you
like
to
play
a
game
of
dominoes
would
be
very
glad
to
do
play
more
fun
in
that
than
in
the
regular
so
the
two
sat
down
and
were
soon
deeply
immersed
in
the
game
you
know
paul
said
jennie
suddenly
feel
as
if
i
had
known
you
for
a
long
time
though
it
is
only
about
twenty
four
hours
since
we
feel
the
same
said
paul
awfully
glad
they
sent
you
here
instead
of
some
other
telegraph
you
would
have
liked
another
one
better
think
i
should
but
i
ought
not
to
say
so
it
may
make
you
boys
ever
vain
i
thought
it
was
only
a
very
impolite
speech
i
shall
have
to
give
you
a
bad
mark
take
it
all
back
better
said
jennie
with
playful
menace
hope
come
up
some
time
when
you
are
not
sent
for
on
business
would
like
to
very
much
if
your
mother
is
she
be
willing
am
only
a
poor
telegraph
mind
that
i
see
why
a
telegraph
boy
as
good
as
a
boy
in
a
store
my
cousin
mark
is
in
a
it
will
be
seen
that
these
young
people
were
rapidly
coming
to
a
very
good
understanding
paul
was
not
in
love
but
he
certainly
did
consider
jennie
cunningham
quite
the
nicest
girl
he
had
ever
met
so
the
time
passed
till
cunningham
returned
his
wife
informed
him
briefly
of
what
had
occurred
they
both
entered
the
room
together
he
was
a
man
of
middle
age
a
very
pleasant
and
easy
mannered
gentleman
you
the
boy
who
drove
away
the
burglar
he
asked
with
a
smile
sir
i
believe
so
answered
paul
let
me
add
my
thanks
to
those
of
my
wife
you
have
done
us
a
great
am
very
glad
to
have
had
the
chance
said
paul
you
will
come
to
my
office
tomorrow
morning
continued
cunningham
will
thank
you
in
a
more
effective
way
come
at
ten
as
you
may
find
it
difficult
to
leave
the
office
otherwise
tell
the
superintendent
that
i
have
an
errand
for
well
is
my
business
paid
took
the
card
and
rose
to
go
said
jennie
you
invite
paul
to
call
and
see
us
sometimes
said
the
lady
smiling
what
he
has
done
he
ought
to
have
the
freedom
of
the
house
we
shall
be
glad
to
see
you
as
a
visitor
paul
she
said
kindly
paul
left
the
house
in
a
flutter
of
pleasant
excitement
he
was
quite
determined
to
avail
himself
of
an
invitation
so
agreeable
he
crossed
over
to
third
avenue
and
returned
by
the
elevated
railway
to
the
home
of
old
jerry
chapter
viii
paul
moves
to
ludlow
street
in
the
evening
paul
found
old
jerry
anxiously
awaiting
him
you
found
a
new
room
paul
he
asked
eagerly
had
time
paul
answered
go
at
once
and
see
about
will
be
here
tomorrow
said
the
old
man
nervously
i
i
am
afraid
of
him
he
is
a
bad
man
he
wants
me
to
give
him
money
you
know
i
have
no
money
paul
he
concluded
with
a
look
of
appeal
now
paul
knew
that
old
jerry
had
money
and
he
could
not
truthfully
answer
as
the
old
man
desired
him
say
so
and
that
is
enough
he
said
true
urged
jerry
who
understood
the
doubt
in
mind
could
i
get
any
money
what
you
give
me
is
all
we
have
to
live
much
at
any
paul
it
much
you
give
me
half
a
dollar
more
two
dollars
and
a
half
are
very
little
for
me
to
live
on
and
pay
the
rent
whined
the
old
man
the
appeal
would
have
moved
paul
if
he
had
not
suspected
that
the
old
man
had
a
considerable
sum
of
money
laid
away
as
it
was
it
only
disgusted
him
and
made
him
feel
angry
at
attempt
to
deceive
him
you
sure
you
get
no
money
except
what
i
give
you
he
asked
pointedly
do
you
mean
paul
demanded
the
old
man
looking
alarmed
gave
you
the
idea
that
i
had
any
other
money
any
rate
said
the
telegraph
boy
any
money
to
throw
away
on
this
son
of
yours
i
have
no
doubt
a
bad
man
as
you
was
always
bad
and
troublesome
james
was
said
old
jerry
was
always
wanting
money
from
the
time
he
was
a
he
was
a
boy
there
was
some
reason
for
his
asking
it
but
now
he
is
a
man
grown
he
old
is
he
must
be
nigh
upon
thirty
answered
jerry
after
a
little
reflection
hire
too
expensive
a
room
paul
he
added
know
we
are
poor
very
poor
unless
i
am
willing
to
pay
the
extra
cost
do
that
give
me
the
extra
money
paul
said
jerry
with
eager
cupidity
i
find
it
hard
to
get
along
with
two
dollars
and
a
half
a
forget
jerry
said
paul
coldly
i
must
have
my
meals
i
live
without
eat
too
much
paul
long
thought
so
hurtful
to
eat
too
much
bad
for
the
take
the
risk
said
paul
with
a
short
laugh
am
not
afraid
of
dying
of
gout
jerry
with
my
present
bill
of
you
mind
my
going
out
a
few
hours
every
day
and
asking
kind
gentlemen
to
help
me
paul
we
we
could
get
along
hear
of
it
jerry
said
paul
sternly
i
hear
of
your
going
out
to
beg
i
will
leave
you
and
go
off
and
live
by
myself
then
there
will
be
no
two
dollars
and
a
half
coming
to
you
every
no
leave
me
paul
said
jerry
thoroughly
alarmed
by
this
threat
go
out
if
you
want
me
to
though
very
very
foolish
to
stay
in
when
there
are
so
many
kind
gentlemen
and
ladies
ready
to
give
money
to
old
added
paul
you
go
out
and
stand
in
the
street
your
son
will
sooner
or
later
find
you
out
and
make
trouble
for
he
will
so
he
will
chimed
in
the
miser
with
the
old
look
of
alarm
on
his
face
are
right
paul
you
are
right
i
must
put
it
off
i
i
wish
he
would
go
away
somewhere
to
to
california
or
some
place
a
great
way
paul
saw
that
he
had
produced
the
effect
he
intended
upon
the
old
mind
and
went
out
at
once
to
look
for
a
new
room
he
finally
found
one
some
half
mile
farther
up
town
in
ludlow
street
a
little
below
grand
the
room
was
better
furnished
than
the
one
in
which
he
and
jerry
had
lived
for
some
years
there
was
a
cheap
carpet
on
the
floor
a
bed
in
one
corner
and
a
shabby
but
comfortable
lounge
on
which
paul
himself
proposed
to
sleep
the
rent
was
two
dollars
a
month
more
than
they
had
been
accustomed
to
pay
but
paul
concluded
to
say
nothing
of
this
to
the
old
man
but
quietly
to
pay
it
out
of
his
own
pocket
it
would
be
but
fifty
cents
a
week
and
he
thought
he
could
make
that
extra
sum
in
some
way
he
was
beginning
to
be
more
fastidious
about
his
accommodations
now
that
he
had
seen
how
people
lived
uptown
in
fact
paul
was
becoming
ambitious
it
was
a
very
proper
ambition
too
he
had
lived
long
enough
in
a
squalid
miserable
room
and
now
he
meant
to
be
better
provided
for
am
getting
older
he
said
to
himself
ought
to
earn
more
money
i
am
sure
i
can
somehow
i
will
keep
my
eyes
open
and
see
what
i
can
paul
resolved
to
buy
a
bureau
if
he
could
get
one
cheap
for
at
present
he
had
absolutely
no
place
in
which
to
keep
his
small
stock
of
clothing
he
did
not
know
exactly
where
the
money
was
coming
from
but
he
was
hopeful
and
had
faith
in
himself
he
was
not
waiting
for
something
to
turn
up
as
many
lazy
boys
do
but
he
meant
himself
to
turn
up
something
having
concluded
a
bargain
for
the
room
paying
a
dollar
down
and
promising
to
pay
a
further
sum
on
saturday
night
when
he
received
his
weekly
pay
he
returned
to
old
jerry
jerry
he
said
cheerfully
found
a
is
it
paul
ludlow
let
us
go
at
once
james
might
change
his
mind
and
come
round
tonight
i
want
to
see
him
he
is
a
bold
bad
paul
suggested
that
they
had
better
not
leave
word
with
the
neighbors
where
they
were
going
as
this
might
furnish
a
clew
to
james
barclay
and
put
him
on
his
track
old
jerry
eagerly
assented
to
this
and
the
two
started
for
their
new
home
they
had
very
little
to
carry
at
any
rate
this
was
the
case
with
the
miser
and
wardrobe
was
not
too
extensive
for
him
to
carry
it
all
with
him
at
once
when
jerry
saw
the
room
that
paul
had
engaged
he
was
alarmed
this
is
too
fine
for
us
paul
he
said
afford
to
pay
for
it
how
much
is
the
rent
dollars
a
month
answered
paul
shall
be
ruined
ejaculated
jerry
turning
pale
is
two
dollars
more
than
we
paid
in
the
old
place
said
paul
it
come
out
of
you
i
will
make
a
new
arrangement
with
you
i
will
pay
the
entire
rent
and
give
you
a
dollar
and
a
half
a
it
two
dollars
paul
said
jerry
in
a
coaxing
tone
are
you
thinking
of
do
you
want
to
starve
me
demanded
paul
sternly
i
am
so
poor
paul
whined
the
miser
am
i
answered
paul
i
must
keep
enough
to
pay
for
my
jerry
saw
that
it
would
be
useless
to
contest
the
point
further
and
settled
himself
in
his
new
quarters
rather
enjoying
the
improvement
but
groaning
inwardly
over
extravagance
paul
threw
himself
on
the
lounge
after
taking
off
his
coat
and
vest
and
covering
himself
with
a
blanket
was
soon
sound
asleep
illustration
paul
threw
himself
on
the
lounge
and
soon
was
fast
asleep
chapter
ix
paul
becomes
a
capitalist
paul
did
not
fail
to
meet
the
appointment
at
office
the
next
morning
he
had
no
difficulty
in
getting
away
for
it
was
understood
at
the
office
that
he
was
wanted
to
run
an
errand
and
his
time
would
be
paid
for
seem
to
be
in
with
the
cunninghams
number
said
the
superintendent
sir
they
are
very
kind
to
me
answered
paul
is
well
we
like
to
have
boys
on
good
terms
with
customers
it
increases
the
business
of
the
cunningham
was
talking
with
another
gentleman
when
paul
entered
his
office
down
paul
he
said
in
a
friendly
tone
indicating
a
chair
shall
soon
be
at
leisure
and
then
i
will
attend
to
you
sir
said
the
telegraph
boy
he
had
to
wait
about
ten
minutes
then
visitor
left
him
and
he
turned
to
paul
is
business
this
morning
he
asked
with
a
smile
is
my
first
call
well
no
doubt
you
will
have
plenty
before
the
day
is
sir
i
am
engaged
for
the
and
in
what
way
am
to
go
shopping
with
a
she
go
by
herself
there
sir
i
suppose
so
but
she
wants
me
to
carry
her
merchants
generally
send
them
sir
but
she
once
had
one
miscarry
and
now
she
prefers
to
take
a
boy
with
do
you
like
that
business
asked
cunningham
is
rather
tiresome
answered
paul
the
lady
is
hard
to
suit
and
spends
a
good
deal
of
time
in
each
store
however
there
is
one
thing
that
reconciles
me
to
is
that
is
liberal
and
always
gives
me
something
for
is
very
considerate
of
her
i
was
speaking
of
that
to
my
wife
this
what
sir
inquired
paul
both
decided
that
you
were
entitled
to
a
present
for
your
brave
defense
of
the
now
i
suppose
it
would
have
been
the
proper
thing
for
paul
to
protest
against
receiving
any
present
but
i
am
obliged
to
record
the
fact
that
he
had
no
objection
to
having
his
services
acknowledged
in
that
way
only
did
my
duty
sir
he
said
modestly
true
but
that
is
no
reason
why
i
should
not
show
my
appreciation
of
the
service
rendered
i
suppose
you
have
no
bank
account
never
got
along
as
far
as
that
sir
said
paul
i
give
you
a
check
as
it
might
inconvenience
paul
was
a
little
surprised
for
a
bank
check
sounded
large
and
the
gratuities
he
usually
received
seldom
reached
as
high
as
fifty
cents
cunningham
drew
out
his
pocketbook
and
taking
out
three
bills
placed
them
in
hands
eyes
expanded
when
he
saw
that
the
first
bill
was
a
ten
but
he
was
destined
to
be
still
more
surprised
for
each
of
the
other
two
was
a
twenty
there
was
fifty
dollars
in
all
all
this
for
me
he
asked
almost
incredulous
here
are
fifty
am
quite
aware
of
it
said
the
merchant
smiling
is
the
exact
sum
i
intended
to
give
know
how
to
thank
you
said
paul
warmly
me
it
is
a
my
giving
you
advice
but
i
hope
you
will
spend
it
will
try
to
do
so
sir
i
will
put
all
but
ten
dollars
in
a
savings
could
not
do
better
you
may
in
time
be
able
to
add
to
shall
try
to
sir
when
i
earn
more
much
do
you
earn
now
presents
it
amounts
to
six
or
seven
dollars
a
week
sometimes
save
out
of
that
sir
i
live
with
an
old
man
and
give
him
two
dollars
and
a
half
a
week
for
rent
and
other
expenses
hereafter
i
am
to
give
him
three
dollars
i
should
give
more
but
i
pay
for
my
own
you
have
no
parents
living
sir
i
am
alone
in
the
the
old
man
any
relation
to
you
you
need
friends
to
call
on
you
will
always
be
welcome
at
my
you
sir
said
paul
gratefully
and
he
decided
to
avail
himself
of
the
invitation
soon
he
was
anxious
to
meet
jennie
cunningham
again
having
no
sister
he
had
enjoyed
scarcely
any
opportunities
of
meeting
girls
except
such
as
sold
matches
or
papers
in
the
streets
and
these
for
the
most
part
were
bold
and
unattractive
cunningham
turned
to
his
desk
and
paul
saw
that
his
interview
was
over
he
did
not
like
to
carry
around
so
much
money
he
was
liable
to
be
robbed
that
he
could
not
afford
so
he
resolved
to
go
around
to
the
bowery
savings
bank
and
deposit
forty
dollars
taking
out
a
book
then
he
would
feel
safe
as
to
that
the
ten
dollars
he
had
a
use
for
as
he
wished
to
buy
a
cheap
bureau
or
trunk
he
had
not
quite
made
up
his
mind
which
he
took
the
shortest
cut
to
the
bowery
savings
bank
this
is
one
of
the
largest
and
most
important
savings
banks
in
the
city
and
its
deposits
exceed
twenty
millions
it
is
a
blessing
to
thousands
of
salaried
men
and
women
mechanics
and
others
in
providing
them
a
safe
place
of
deposit
for
their
surplus
money
paul
entered
the
bank
and
going
up
to
the
proper
clerk
subscribed
the
books
of
the
bank
giving
his
age
and
other
particulars
necessary
to
identification
and
then
rather
to
the
surprise
of
the
bank
officer
wrote
out
a
deposit
check
for
forty
dollars
have
just
been
paid
off
i
take
it
he
said
with
a
smile
sir
answered
paul
pay
i
presume
earned
it
in
considerably
less
time
than
that
i
earned
it
all
and
ten
dollars
besides
in
one
your
business
is
better
than
mine
i
should
be
willing
to
a
steady
business
said
paul
is
it
a
house
from
am
not
quite
sure
how
i
should
like
that
business
there
might
be
some
risk
attending
business
was
completed
and
he
prepared
to
go
away
the
book
he
put
in
his
pocket
and
took
his
way
back
to
the
office
on
broadway
he
began
to
feel
like
a
young
capitalist
forty
dollars
may
not
seem
a
very
large
sum
to
some
of
my
fortunate
readers
but
paul
had
never
before
possessed
ten
dollars
at
a
time
and
to
him
it
seemed
a
small
fortune
he
had
no
idea
that
his
visit
to
the
bank
was
observed
by
any
one
that
knew
him
but
such
was
the
case
old
jerry
as
the
reader
already
knows
was
a
depositor
at
the
bowery
savings
bank
and
this
very
morning
having
a
small
deposit
to
make
he
was
shambling
along
the
bowery
when
he
saw
paul
descend
the
steps
with
a
bank
book
in
his
hand
he
was
intensely
surprised
chapter
paul
loses
his
bank
book
old
jerry
felt
outraged
at
withholding
money
from
him
for
deposit
in
the
savings
bank
the
thieving
young
rascal
he
muttered
to
himself
indignantly
is
putting
my
money
into
the
bank
and
letting
me
starve
at
home
while
he
lives
on
the
fat
of
the
land
and
lays
up
money
me
that
have
taken
care
of
him
ever
since
he
was
a
little
boy
and
and
cared
for
him
like
a
jerry
had
a
curious
idea
of
the
way
fathers
care
for
their
children
judging
from
his
words
when
paul
was
only
six
years
old
he
had
been
sent
into
the
streets
to
sell
matches
and
papers
and
being
a
bright
winning
boy
had
earned
considerably
more
even
at
that
tender
age
than
many
older
boys
at
times
jerry
had
induced
him
to
beg
but
it
was
only
for
a
short
time
paul
had
a
natural
pride
and
independence
that
made
him
shrink
from
asking
alms
as
soon
as
he
was
old
enough
to
understand
the
humiliation
of
it
so
there
was
never
a
time
when
he
had
not
earned
his
own
living
and
more
besides
but
jerry
chose
to
forget
this
and
to
charge
paul
with
ingratitude
when
he
discovered
that
he
had
a
private
fund
of
his
own
must
get
hold
of
that
money
thought
jerry
wonder
how
much
paul
has
there
was
no
way
of
finding
out
unless
he
got
hold
of
the
book
or
inquired
at
the
bank
he
decided
to
do
the
latter
accordingly
he
went
over
to
the
bank
and
entering
it
walked
up
to
the
receiving
teller
there
a
boy
named
paul
parton
here
just
now
he
asked
what
of
it
he
put
some
money
into
the
bank
much
was
it
give
information
about
our
depositors
said
the
teller
he
your
grandson
that
is
he
lives
with
are
a
depositor
also
are
you
not
i
seem
to
remember
your
is
your
name
remember
now
why
do
you
want
to
know
about
this
boy
ought
to
have
given
me
the
money
instead
of
putting
it
into
the
have
nothing
to
do
with
that
he
did
not
steal
it
from
you
i
answered
jerry
reluctantly
it
occurred
to
him
for
an
instant
to
claim
that
paul
had
robbed
him
but
he
was
rather
afraid
that
the
telegraph
boy
would
in
that
case
become
angry
and
leave
him
and
the
sum
he
had
in
bank
would
not
pay
him
for
that
the
miser
did
not
suspect
that
paul
had
over
five
dollars
laid
up
having
no
knowledge
of
the
handsome
gift
he
had
received
from
cunningham
but
even
if
it
were
only
five
dollars
it
was
sufficient
to
excite
cupidity
and
he
decided
that
he
must
manage
to
get
possession
of
it
you
tell
me
how
much
money
paul
has
in
the
bank
is
against
our
jerry
felt
that
he
was
dismissed
and
stumbled
out
of
the
bank
forgetting
in
his
thoughts
about
paul
the
business
of
his
own
which
had
brought
him
there
but
there
was
other
business
for
jerry
to
attend
to
that
morning
we
are
about
to
let
the
reader
into
a
secret
which
he
had
hitherto
kept
from
paul
not
far
away
was
a
small
tenement
house
which
jerry
hired
and
sublet
to
tenants
every
month
he
called
to
collect
his
rents
and
the
difference
between
the
rent
he
paid
for
the
whole
building
and
the
rents
he
collected
from
the
tenants
gave
him
a
handsome
profit
it
was
not
rent
day
but
there
were
two
of
the
tenants
in
arrears
one
was
a
laborer
temporarily
out
of
work
and
the
other
was
a
poor
widow
who
went
out
scrubbing
but
was
now
taken
down
with
rheumatism
and
therefore
not
able
to
work
the
old
man
ascended
with
painful
toil
to
the
third
floor
and
called
on
the
widow
first
she
turned
pale
when
she
saw
him
enter
for
she
knew
his
errand
and
how
little
chance
there
was
of
softening
him
hope
you
have
got
the
rent
for
me
this
morning
said
jerry
harshly
where
would
i
get
it
barclay
she
asked
very
little
work
i
can
do
on
account
of
the
sharp
pains
i
none
of
my
business
said
jerry
in
a
harsh
tone
will
have
to
go
would
you
put
me
on
the
street
me
and
my
poor
childer
said
the
poor
woman
with
a
troubled
look
afraid
the
hard
heart
you
have
talk
nonsense
said
jerry
sharply
let
you
stay
here
for
nothing
i
very
poor
myself
he
added
with
his
customary
whine
poor
repeated
the
widow
bitterly
heard
that
rolling
in
riches
who
says
so
asked
jerry
alarmed
says
you
can
tell
very
much
do
you
do
with
all
the
rent
you
get
from
this
building
then
pay
it
away
that
is
almost
all
of
it
i
own
the
building
i
i
hire
it
and
some
months
on
account
of
losses
i
make
a
cent
asseverated
jerry
i
think
a
little
out
take
the
year
why
you
give
it
up
if
you
make
any
money
out
of
it
that
is
nothing
to
the
purpose
once
more
will
you
pay
me
my
rent
can
i
when
i
have
no
money
you
must
borrow
it
give
you
till
tomorrow
and
not
a
day
longer
remember
that
will
you
not
next
jerry
visited
the
other
tenant
with
rather
better
success
for
he
collected
one
dollar
on
account
he
waited
eagerly
for
paul
to
come
home
he
had
made
up
his
mind
to
explore
pockets
after
he
was
asleep
and
get
possession
of
his
bank
book
with
that
as
he
thought
he
would
go
to
the
bank
and
draw
the
money
that
stood
in
name
it
would
be
a
theft
but
jerry
did
not
look
at
it
in
that
light
he
persuaded
himself
that
he
had
a
perfect
right
to
take
the
property
of
the
boy
who
was
living
under
his
guardianship
though
to
speak
properly
it
was
rather
paul
that
took
care
of
him
it
was
rather
late
in
the
evening
when
paul
got
home
for
every
other
evening
he
was
employed
the
old
man
was
awake
but
pretended
to
be
asleep
paul
took
off
his
coat
and
vest
and
threw
himself
on
the
lounge
covering
himself
up
with
a
quilt
his
clothes
he
put
on
a
chair
alongside
it
was
not
long
before
he
was
sound
asleep
being
much
fatigued
with
the
labors
of
the
day
old
jerry
got
up
cautiously
from
the
bed
he
too
was
dressed
for
he
seldom
took
the
trouble
to
undress
and
cautiously
drew
near
the
lounge
he
took
up
coat
and
threw
his
fingers
into
an
inside
pocket
his
eyes
sparkled
with
delight
as
he
drew
out
the
telegraph
bank
book
got
it
he
muttered
gleefully
any
match
for
the
old
man
i
i
wonder
how
much
money
he
has
saved
up
paul
slept
on
unaware
of
the
cunning
old
treachery
and
of
the
danger
to
which
his
little
treasure
was
exposed
chapter
xi
at
the
savings
bank
old
jerry
laid
down
coat
and
opened
the
bank
book
of
which
he
had
just
obtained
possession
he
was
eager
to
ascertain
how
much
paul
had
saved
up
dollars
he
could
hardly
believe
his
eyes
how
in
the
world
could
paul
have
managed
to
save
up
forty
dollars
dollars
exclaimed
old
jerry
gleefully
in
luck
for
once
of
course
it
belongs
to
me
i
am
guardian
and
have
a
right
to
his
earnings
he
have
kept
it
from
me
i
i
will
go
to
the
bank
and
draw
it
all
tomorrow
then
i
will
put
it
in
in
my
own
name
that
will
make
it
all
and
old
jerry
rubbed
his
hands
joyfully
after
this
theft
for
it
can
be
called
by
no
other
name
jerry
did
not
sleep
much
he
was
too
much
excited
by
the
unexpected
magnitude
of
his
discovery
and
by
his
delight
at
adding
so
much
to
his
own
hoards
then
again
he
was
afraid
paul
might
wake
up
and
discovering
his
loss
demand
from
him
the
restitution
of
the
book
generally
paul
rose
at
six
as
this
enabled
him
to
get
his
breakfast
and
get
round
to
the
telegraph
company
at
seven
he
generally
waked
about
fifteen
minutes
before
the
hour
such
was
the
force
of
habit
this
morning
he
woke
at
the
usual
time
but
old
jerry
had
got
up
softly
and
left
the
room
twenty
minutes
before
turning
over
paul
glanced
toward
the
bed
in
the
corner
and
was
surprised
to
see
no
signs
of
the
old
man
gone
out
already
he
said
to
himself
in
amazement
wonder
come
over
him
i
hope
he
paul
however
borrow
any
trouble
for
he
concluded
that
jerry
had
got
tired
of
his
bed
and
gone
out
for
a
morning
walk
he
lay
till
seven
and
then
throwing
off
the
quilt
rose
from
the
lounge
he
was
already
partly
dressed
and
only
needed
to
put
on
his
coat
then
with
a
cheerful
smile
he
felt
for
his
bank
book
which
he
had
placed
in
the
inside
pocket
of
his
coat
was
not
there
he
started
and
turned
pale
is
my
bank
book
he
asked
himself
in
alarm
then
it
flashed
upon
him
jerry
has
taken
it
he
said
sternly
has
slunk
off
with
it
before
i
am
up
why
he
got
up
so
early
but
put
a
spoke
in
his
wheel
go
to
the
bank
and
give
notice
that
my
book
has
been
stolen
he
draw
the
money
on
it
if
i
can
prevent
but
paul
was
unable
to
carry
out
his
intention
of
calling
at
the
bank
at
the
hour
of
opening
in
order
to
give
notice
of
his
loss
on
reporting
for
duty
at
the
telegraph
office
he
was
sent
over
to
jersey
city
where
he
was
detained
until
eleven
he
felt
uneasy
and
thought
of
asking
to
have
some
other
boy
assigned
to
the
duty
but
it
so
happened
that
the
superintendent
was
not
in
an
amiable
frame
of
mind
and
he
knew
that
his
request
would
not
be
granted
meanwhile
about
five
minutes
after
the
bank
was
opened
old
jerry
shambled
in
and
sitting
down
at
a
table
wrote
out
an
order
for
forty
dollars
in
favor
of
book
no
signing
it
this
he
took
to
the
desk
of
the
cashier
give
me
the
money
on
this
he
said
the
cashier
eyed
him
sharply
you
paul
parton
he
demanded
faltered
the
old
man
am
you
put
in
this
money
for
him
he
write
this
order
old
jerry
would
have
had
no
scruples
about
asserting
that
it
was
written
by
paul
but
he
knew
that
the
statement
would
at
once
be
recognized
as
false
as
he
had
himself
written
it
in
the
presence
of
the
cashier
he
admitted
reluctantly
it
makes
no
difference
paul
is
busy
and
come
a
telegraph
boy
wanted
me
to
draw
it
for
it
will
be
seen
that
old
conscience
was
elastic
and
that
he
had
no
scruple
about
lying
answer
replied
the
cashier
eying
the
old
man
suspiciously
is
not
according
to
our
i
want
to
use
the
money
that
is
paul
does
remonstrated
old
jerry
disappointed
makes
no
get
paul
to
write
an
order
said
jerry
as
he
left
the
bank
old
man
stole
the
book
thought
the
cashier
he
is
going
home
to
forge
an
order
in
the
that
is
exactly
what
old
jerry
meant
to
do
he
thought
it
best
however
to
wait
till
afternoon
meanwhile
at
twelve
paul
then
for
the
first
time
able
to
get
away
hurried
into
the
bank
breathless
want
to
give
notice
that
my
bank
book
has
been
taken
he
said
panting
name
please
of
book
book
was
presented
two
hours
since
by
an
old
man
who
handed
in
an
order
for
all
the
the
perspiration
gathered
on
brow
you
give
it
to
him
it
is
not
according
to
our
rules
to
pay
except
to
the
written
order
of
the
am
glad
of
that
said
paul
pay
it
if
he
comes
will
not
replied
the
cashier
and
paul
left
the
building
feeling
greatly
relieved
old
jerry
ought
to
have
known
that
there
was
very
little
chance
of
a
forged
order
being
honored
for
the
bank
possessed
autograph
signature
on
its
books
making
the
fact
of
the
forgery
evident
at
once
but
it
sometimes
happens
that
men
sharp
in
some
matters
are
very
obtuse
in
others
this
was
the
case
with
old
jerry
in
the
present
instance
about
two
he
entered
the
bank
once
more
paul
had
not
come
home
at
the
noon
hour
he
seldom
did
being
in
the
habit
of
dining
at
a
restaurant
and
the
old
man
thought
him
still
ignorant
of
the
theft
he
was
anxious
to
draw
the
money
before
the
telegraph
boy
learned
that
his
book
had
been
appropriated
he
had
prepared
an
order
having
taken
one
with
him
in
blank
and
made
it
out
for
forty
dollars
signing
it
armed
with
this
he
walked
up
to
the
window
and
without
a
word
presented
it
in
the
book
the
cashier
recognized
him
instantly
he
said
do
you
want
money
answered
the
old
man
his
features
working
with
cupidity
were
here
this
morning
told
you
you
could
not
draw
out
the
money
on
your
own
is
order
returned
jerry
with
unblushing
falsehood
he
write
it
thought
you
said
he
was
occupied
by
he
came
home
at
noon
and
wrote
the
is
false
said
the
cashier
sternly
boy
has
been
here
to
report
that
his
book
has
been
stolen
and
forbade
us
to
pay
out
any
money
on
the
old
face
was
the
picture
of
dismay
some
mistake
he
managed
to
mutter
must
be
some
other
boy
paul
asked
me
to
draw
the
money
besides
it
his
money
at
all
it
it
rightfully
belongs
to
can
draw
no
money
on
the
order
which
you
have
forged
said
the
cashier
sternly
give
me
back
the
book
said
jerry
beginning
to
get
frightened
shall
retain
the
book
for
the
rightful
owner
said
the
official
now
let
me
advise
you
never
to
come
here
again
on
any
such

it
my
duty
to
hand
you
over
to
the
without
another
word
old
jerry
shambled
out
of
the
bank
with
a
scared
look
on
his
face
this
reference
to
the
police
startled
him
it
had
not
occurred
to
him
that
he
was
doing
anything
of
which
the
law
could
take
cognizance
his
exultation
of
the
morning
had
quite
passed
away
he
had
flattered
himself
that
his
hoard
would
increase
by
forty
dollars
now
he
had
found
himself
foiled
in
the
attempt
to
convert
savings
to
his
own
use
about
six
paul
returned
to
the
humble
home
old
jerry
was
resting
on
the
bed
in
the
corner
he
looked
up
nervously
as
the
telegraph
boy
entered
and
saw
at
once
by
the
expression
on
face
that
he
knew
all
said
paul
did
you
take
my
bank
book
so
poor
paul
whined
jerry
i
needed
the
you

boy
indignantly

right

said
paul
with
emphasis
you

the
book

complained
jerry
they
did
right
if
you

such
a
trick
on

again
robbing
me
in
my
sleep

panic
stricken

book
in
your
pocket
at
this
you
rob
me
paul
implored

if

of
he
went
out
to
supper
leaving
jerry
utterly
discomposed
not
only
had
his
plan
failed
but
his
secret
had
been
discovered
chapter
xii
james
disappointment
though
he
is
a
very
unworthy
specimen
of
humanity
the
reader
may
feel
interested
to
know
something
more
about
james
barclay
whose
acquaintance
we
made
while
he
was
attempting
to
commit
a
burglary
it
was
mere
accident
that
made
him
acquainted
with
the
fact
that
his
father
was
living
in
new
york
to
him
it
seemed
a
most
fortunate
discovery
knowing
old
miserly
habits
he
had
no
doubt
that
the
old
man
was
worth
some
thousands
of
dollars
and
upon
this
sum
he
felt
that
he
had
a
right
to
draw
his
father
was
timid
and
he
depended
upon
terrifying
him
into
complying
with
his
demands
the
first
visit
terminated
as
well
as
he
expected
he
suppose
that
jerry
kept
much
money
in
his
room
hence
his
arrangement
to
come
back
the
next
day
as
he
left
the
poor
tenement
house
he
chuckled
to
himself
scare
the
old
man
into
giving
me
all
the
money
i
want
it
will
be
like
drawing
a
tooth
and
no
doubt
make
a
great
fuss
but
no
escape
for
him
he
can
live
on
little
or
nothing
and
enjoy
it
it
do
him
any
real
harm
to
let
me
have
say
half
of
his
miserly
hoard
egad
james
barclay
in
luck
at
last
i
thought
when
that
telegraph
kid
foiled
me
last
night
that
nothing
would
go
well
with
me
but
things
seem
turning
if
i
ever
meet
that
boy
again
i
must
give
him
a
lesson
a
bold
young
rascal
though
and
would
be
a
credit
to
my
line
of
it
is
doubted
whether
paul
would
have
considered
this
a
compliment
if
he
had
heard
it
his
ambitions
did
not
run
in
the
direction
of
becoming
a
successful
burglar
it
was
a
question
with
james
barclay
where
to
spend
the
intervening
time
as
he
was
not
to
call
on
his
father
till
the
next
day
he
was
about
at
the
end
of
his
resources
having
less
than
a
dollar
in
silver
in
his
possession
he
might
have
tried
to
hatch
up
some
dishonest
scheme
for
filling
his
pockets
but
for
the
chance
discovery
of
his
father
that
afforded
a
chance
quite
as
promising
and
far
less
perilous
and
he
decided
not
to
make
any
illegal
ventures
till
he
had
made
all
he
could
out
of
old
jerry
rather
be
honest
he
said
to
himself
in
a
glow
of
virtuous
feeling
confound
it
a
man
must
live
and
as
the
world
owes
me
a
living
i
must
get
it
one
way
or
it
did
not
seem
to
occur
to
james
barclay
that
the
same
chance
existed
for
him
as
for
the
majority
of
his
fellow
men
a
chance
of
earning
a
living
by
honest
work
labor
and
industry
he
abhorred
they
might
do
for
others
but
not
for
him
be
in
funds
he
said
to
himself
complacently
what
shall
i
do
with
myself
today
a
man
do
much
without
it
occurred
to
him
that
an
old
acquaintance
rather
a
shady
acquaintance
by
the
way
used
to
live
in
jersey
city
he
would
go
over
and
see
him
it
would
while
away
the
time
in
a
pleasant
manner
and
he
might
get
news
of
his
other
companions
for
he
had
been
out
of
the
city
himself
for
several
years
in
fact
for
we
need
not
keep
the
secret
from
the
reader
he
had
been
passing
three
years
in
seclusion
at
the
village
of
sing
sing
on
the
hudson
that
accounted
for
his
father
having
been
spared
any
visits
for
that
length
of
time
james
barclay
turned
down
cortlandt
street
and
made
his
way
to
the
ferry
at
the
foot
of
the
street
he
invested
three
cents
in
a
ferry
ticket
and
in
a
few
minutes
set
foot
in
jersey
city
a
long
time
since
i
have
been
here
he
reflected
to
one
jack
hanging
out
at
the
old
place
however
i
can
he
made
his
way
to
the
former
abode
of
his
old
friend
jack
cratts
who
was
much
such
a
character
as
himself
but
being
more
prudent
less
apt
to
get
into
trouble
he
only
met
with
disappointment
another
family
occupied
the
room
once
tenanted
by
jack
and
he
could
obtain
no
information
as
to
the
whereabouts
of
his
friend
james
barclay
was
disappointed
the
time
was
hanging
heavily
on
his
hands
he
made
his
way
slowly
toward
the
ferry
when
he
encountered
a
poorly
dressed
woman
of
about
thirty
carrying
a
heavy
basket
of
clothes
she
was
evidently
a
laundress
his
face
lighted
up
with
instant
recognition
it
you
ellen
he
said
the
woman
turned
pale
and
nearly
dropped
the
basket
she
was
carrying
she
ejaculated
faintly
ellen
it
is
your
poor
unfortunate
husband
egad
glad
to
see
it
was
now
over
three
years
since
james
barclay
and
his
wife
had
met
she
had
never
been
very
happy
with
him
after
the
first
few
months
of
married
life
and
she
did
not
know
now
whether
to
be
glad
or
sorry
she
had
met
him
she
had
not
lost
all
love
for
him
wives
seldom
do
under
any
provocation
but
she
knew
him
too
well
to
believe
that
he
had
changed
materially
he
was
likely
still
to
prove
a
disturbing
element
in
her
life
yet
she
felt
a
momentary
pleasure
lonely
as
she
was
in
meeting
the
man
who
ten
years
before
had
captured
her
affections
you
glad
to
see
me
ellen
asked
barclay
in
an
unusually
pleasant
tone
she
answered
slowly
are
the
children
i
suppose
i
should
know
are
well
jimmy
and
mary
are
going
to
school
jimmy
sells
papers
evenings
to
help
me
old
is
the
young
rascal
years
he
a
chip
of
the
old
block
eh
ellen
hope
not
said
the
woman
heartily
then
with
a
half
frightened
look
she
added
be
offended
with
me
james
but
i
want
him
to
follow
in
your
offense
ellen
said
barclay
laughingly
pretend
to
be
an
angel
and
i
hope
the
kid
will
be
more
of
one
than
i
and
how
are
you
yourself
old
woman
had
to
work
very
hard
james
sighed
the
woman
been
all
i
can
do
to
earn
a
poor
living
for
the
wish
i
could
help
you
and
perhaps
i
may
expecting
some
money
tomorrow
and
hanged
if
i
give
you
ten
dollars
of
would
be
a
great
help
to
me
james
said
his
wife
with
a
momentary
look
of
pleasure
you
going
home
now
go
along
too
and
see
what
sort
of
a
crib
got
can
you
let
me
have
some
dinner
james
though
be
a
poor
i
mind
here
give
me
that
basket
stronger
than
he
really
reformed
and
become
better
thought
ellen
puzzled
she
had
never
been
used
to
such
marks
of
attention
from
her
husband
but
he
was
in
an
amiable
frame
of
mind
he
had
found
a
place
of
refuge
till
the
next
day
and
then
he
would
draw
fifty
dollars
from
his
father
the
first
of
many
forced
loans
he
promised
himself
he
lounged
away
the
rest
of
the
day
at
his
poor
room
when
the
children
came
home
from
school
he
received
them
with
boisterous
good
nature
they
seemed
afraid
of
him
remembering
his
severity
in
earlier
days
but
this
only
seemed
to
amuse
him
a
pretty
way
to
receive
your
loving
father
he
said
laughingly
here
and
sit
on
my
knee
the
little
girl
obeyed
with
scared
face
because
she
did
not
dare
to
refuse
lest
she
should
anger
her
father
so
the
day
passed
james
barclay
lay
in
bed
late
next
morning
but
about
eleven
started
for
new
york
to
meet
the
appointment
with
his
father
a
little
before
noon
he
ascended
the
staircase
and
opened
the
door
of
the
room
which
he
had
visited
the
day
before
it
was
empty
his
face
darkened
and
an
unpleasant
misgiving
entered
his
mind
he
knocked
at
the
door
of
the
opposite
room
which
was
opened
by
a
woman
has
become
of
the
old
man
who
occupied
the
room
opposite
he
asked
has
moved
answered
duane
when
did
he
move
morning
i
has
he
gone
to
leave
old
fox
muttered
james
barclay
has
gone
to
get
rid
of
me
but
follow
him
up
and
sooner
or
later
find
chapter
xiii
james
barclay
at
home
james
disappointment
was
intense
when
he
discovered
that
his
father
had
eluded
him
he
was
almost
penniless
and
had
nothing
of
sufficient
value
to
pawn
had
he
raised
the
sum
which
he
had
expected
from
old
jerry
it
is
doubtful
whether
he
would
have
returned
to
his
family
in
jersey
city
as
it
was
he
had
no
other
resource
his
wife
who
took
in
washing
to
do
at
home
was
hard
at
work
ironing
when
the
door
opened
and
her
husband
entered
a
frown
was
on
his
face
and
he
was
evidently
in
ill
temper
a
cat
the
family
pet
being
in
his
way
he
kicked
her
brutally
and
the
poor
animal
moaning
piteously
fled
in
wild
dismay
out
of
the
way
you
beast
he
said
angrily
kick
poor
topsy
pleaded
his
wife
am
afraid
you
have
hurt
the
poor
little
her
out
of
my
way
then
growled
barclay
hate
cats
you
must
be
a
fool
to
keep
children
love
poor
topsy
james
said
his
wife
suppose
keep
a
snake
for
them
if
they
liked
kitten
is
very
different
from
a
shall
kill
it
some
time
if
it
gets
in
my
way
have
you
got
anything
to
eat
in
the
house
barclay
paused
in
her
work
long
enough
to
get
some
bread
and
meat
from
the
pantry
which
she
set
before
her
husband
are
the
children
he
asked
after
a
while
have
gone
to
ought
to
be
earning
something
at
their
age
growled
barclay
are
very
young
yet
james
you
have
me
take
them
from
school
do
much
have
them
grow
up
ignorant
surely
have
got
to
earn
something
i
support
them
in
as
it
was
some
years
since
he
had
contributed
a
cent
to
their
support
his
wife
quite
appreciate
his
complaint
but
she
knew
too
much
of
her
temper
to
argue
with
him
sells
papers
when
he
gets
home
from
school
she
said
much
does
he
earn
that
way
from
fifteen
to
twenty
need
to
earn
more
i
can
tell
you
that
very
poor
ellen
and
cursed
unfortunate
too
i
money
enough
to
buy
a
ten
cent
will
try
to
support
the
children
if
you
will
take
care
of
yourself
any
man
with
a
spark
of
true
manhood
in
him
would
have
been
shamed
by
such
a
proposition
but
james
barclay
was
a
thoroughly
selfish
man
it
seemed
to
him
that
his
wife
ought
to
support
him
too
you
got
a
dollar
about
you
ellen
he
asked
she
answered
hesitatingly
i
must
buy
some
bread
and
groceries
this
evening
or
the
children
have
their
to
me
you
care
more
about
the
children
than
you
do
about
your
husband
a
pretty
wife
you
are
deserve
that
james
of
course
you
are
welcome
to
your
share
of
the
you
so
you
want
to
treat
me
as
a
the
man
was
utterly
unreasonable
and
his
wife
can
hardly
be
blamed
if
there
rose
in
her
mind
a
regret
that
he
had
not
stayed
away
longer
and
left
her
and
the
children
in
peace
thought
you
expected
to
have
some
money
today
james
she
said
but
i
get
it
just
my
cursed
luck
he
answered
bitterly
own
father
turns
his
back
on
me
and
give
me
a
cent
though
he
has
money
in
father
said
his
wife
in
surprise
he
have
you
seen
him
i
saw
him
yesterday
and
told
him
i
would
call
today
for
fifty
dollars
i
went
and
found
the
old
scoundrel
had
it
right
to
call
your
father
by
such
a
name
he
may
not
have
had
the
know
my
father
a
miser
and
always
has
been
he
lives
in
a
wretched
hole
not
so
good
as
this
place
while
he
has
thousands
of
dollars
invested
or
hidden
somewhere
he
thinks
got
rid
of
me
here
an
oath
escaped
his
lips
will
find
all
this
was
new
to
barclay
who
had
heard
very
little
of
her
family
if
you
find
him
you
could
induce
him
to
come
and
live
with
us
she
said
might
take
an
interest
in
the
children
and
do
something
for
likely
he
would
want
to
live
off
us
however
if
i
could
once
get
him
here
manage
to
get
my
hand
into
his
purse
a
good
he
live
alone
he
must
be
an
old
all
bent
and
shriveled
up
got
a
telegraph
boy
living
with
him
he
told
me

the
other
night

impudent
young
rascal
like
to

the
neck
for
did

him
james
james
barclay
eyed
his
wife
suspiciously

did
not

to
tell
her
under
what
circumstances

met
paul

you
mind
old
woman
he
said

barclay
slapping

with
emphasis

his
number
and
then
be
easy
to

tired
of

he
rejoined
roughly
you
refuse
me
the
money

it
in
some
other
he
glared
round
the
room
and
his
eyes
rested
on
a
dress
that
his
wife
had
just
ironed
can
raise
something
on
that
he
said
seizing
the
dress
and
preparing
to
carry
it
away
james
for
sake
cried
his
wife
terrified
dress
belongs
to
one
of
my
customers
it
would
be
stealing
to
take
it
probably
got
plenty
of
others
she
can
spare
it
he
said
his
wife
hastened
to
him
and
tried
to
wrench
the
dress
from
his
grasp
but
holding
it
in
one
hand
beyond
her
reach
he
gripped
her
arm
with
the
other
so
hard
that
she
uttered
a
cry
of
pain
at
this
moment
the
door
was
pushed
open
and
a
new
character
appeared
upon
the
scene
in
the
person
of
a
stalwart
policeman
all
this
he
demanded
in
a
tone
of
authority
that
woman
or
take
you
chapter
xiv
on
the
track
of
number
the
sudden
appearance
can
be
easily
explained
he
and
his
family
occupied
rooms
in
the
same
house
with
barclay
and
he
happened
to
be
passing
the
door
of
her
apartment
when
he
heard
the
cry
all
this
he
demanded
once
more
of
your
business
returned
barclay
indignantly
call
have
you
to
intrude
where
not
wanted
often
do
that
said
the
policeman
grimly
barclay
who
is
this
man
husband
do
you
hear
that
demanded
barclay
have
a
right
to
be
were
you
about
to
do
to
your
wife
what
made
her
cry
out
asked
the
policeman
sharply
ask
you
that
question
husband
was
carrying
off
that
dress
to
pawn
it
replied
the
wife
does
not
belong
to
me
and
it
would
have
got
me
into
have
you
to
say
to
that
asked
the
officer
turning
to
barclay
wife
would
give
me
no
money
answered
barclay
sullenly
i
threatened
to
pawn
her
says
it
was
not
her
thought
it
was
said
barclay
james
began
his
wife
but
a
threatening
look
from
her
husband
stopped
her
words
then
you
treated
her
roughly
it
seems
i
i
just
took
her
by
the
arm
to
stop
her
getting
the
you
any
complaint
to
make
barclay
asked
the
officer
if
he
will
give
me
the
dress
back
it
belong
to
me
and
i
want
to
lose
the
dress
said
barclay
throwing
it
down
you
make
no
more
trouble
said
the
policeman
in
a
warning
voice
as
he
left
the
room
did
the
cop
come
from
asked
barclay
lives
in
the
i
wish
move
out
of
it
cops
are
no
company
for
decent
it
is
small
wonder
that
james
barclay
did
not
enjoy
the
company
of
a
class
of
men
who
first
and
last
had
given
him
considerable
trouble
his
wife
did
not
reply
but
picked
up
the
rumpled
dress
and
began
to
smooth
it

barclay

his
tone

and

whistling
arrived
in

james
barclay
lost
no
time
in
returning
to
his
old
lodgings
one
of
the
tenants
chanced
to
be
just
coming
out
of
the
house
with
a
bundle
of
clean
clothes
which
she
was
about
to
carry
to
a
customer
me
said
barclay
politely
for
he
could
be
polite
when
he
saw
fit
believe
you
knew
an
old
man
who
moved
away
from
here
recently
jerry
yes
i
knew
him
well
he
lived
here
ever
since
i
did
and
what
took
him
away
so
sudden
i
am
sorry
not
to
find
him
for
i
know
of
something
to
his
leave
word
where
he
was
going
the
pity
i
wish
he
had
for
like
to
have
called
to
see
him
and
the
bye
some
was
a
boy
then
who
lived
with
him
i
believe
i
have
heard
him
mentioned
sir
and
a
nice
bye
he
was
and
a
smart
one
he
was
rale
kind
to
the
old
man
paul
was
and
i
think
old
jerry
could
have
got
along
without
was
employed
in
a
store
he
asked
barclay
assuming
less
knowledge
than
he
possessed
indade
paul
is
a
telegraph
bye
and
has
been
for
two
years
a
favorite
with
the
company
as
he
ought
to
be
for
he
always
attinds
to
his
duties
and
is
up
early
and
a
telegraph
boy
said
barclay
musingly
should
like
to
see
him
especially
as
you
speak
so
well
of
him
he
has
a
number
he
i
notice
the
boys
have
a
number
on
their
sir
paul
is
number
returned
barclay
briskly
think
i
can
remember
that
much
obliged
to
you
my
good
and
a
very
polite
gintleman
said
who
was
flattered
at
being
called
a
lady
i
be
polite
to
a
lady
like
you
said
barclay
you
can
give
me
a
little
more
and
i
will
if
i
can
what
office
can
i
find
this
paul
number
as
you
call
him
i
should
like
to
speak
to
him
about
my
aged
just
recollect
the
number
sir
but
the
office
where
paul
goes
is
on
broadway
same
side
as
the
nicholas
hotel
and
not
far
away
from
you
very
much
you
are
really
the
most
obliging
lady
i
have
met
for
a
long
sir
you
flatter
me
you
must
have
kissed
the
blarney
stone
a
i
but
i
hope
i
know
enough
to
be
polite
to
a
lady
you
seem
like
a
stranger
to
me
for
you
are
the
image
of
a
lady
i
used
to
know
on
the
other
side
of
the
water
the
countess
of
smiled
and
simpered
for
she
had
never
before
been
compared
to
a
countess

i
do
any
more
for
you
sir
she
said
thank
you
you
have
given
me
all
the
information

require
good
day
as
barclay
walked
away
followed
him
with
her
eyes
dressed
very
nice
she
said
to
herself
in
his
manners
a
perfect
gintleman
like
to
see
that
countess
of
galway
that
i
look
so
much

into
business
getting
on
finely
old
fellow
said
james
barclay
to
himself
as
he
left
the
tenement
house
and
steered
toward
broadway
managed
that
old
woman
skillfully
and
got
all
the
information
i
want
i
think
jerry
barclay
you
long
elude
me
i
shall
have
no
trouble
now
in
finding
the
telegraph
boy
and
then
i
shall
soon
be
face
to
face
with
the
old
arrived
at
printing
house
square
he
struck
across
the
city
hall
park
the
other
side
of
which
is
skirted
by
broadway
sitting
on
one
of
the
benches
was
a
man
rather
showily
dressed
with
a
red
blotched
face
and
an
indefinable
expression
that
stamped
him
as
one
who
lived
by
his
wits
rather
than
by
honest
toil
as
glance
rested
upon
him
he
uttered
an
exclamation
of
surprise
slocum
is
that
you
he
said
barclay
as
a
sinner
said
the
other
rising
and
extending
a
rough
hand
on
one
of
whose
fingers
sparkled
a
ring
set
with
what
might
have
been
a
diamond
but
was
probably
paste
how
is
the
world
using
you
old
pal
answered
barclay
old
gone
back
on
me
and
my
own
wife
made
a
great
fuss
because
i
wanted
to
borrow
a
dollar
sometimes
i
think
i
was
better
off
in
our
old
boarding
place
up
the
bill
slocum
was
one
of
his
fellow
boarders
up
at
sing
sing
world
owes
you
a
living
barclay
said
his
friend
it
does
but
a
chap
going
to
collect
his
claim
what
like
to
well
ways
if
you
only
know
how
said
slocum
rather
enigmatically
are
you
it
yourself
asked
barclay
curiously
get
enough
to
eat
and
drink
and
wear
i
in
no
anxiety
about
do
you
do
it
look
at
that
bill
slocum
drew
from
his
pocket
a
roll
of
bills
and
held
it
up
for
his
companion
to
see
it
was
a
thick
roll
and
amounted
to
a
fair
sum
even
if
the
denominations
were
small
you
get
all
that
asked
barclay
more
where
they
come
from
answered
slocum
there
any
for
me
asked
barclay
eagerly
if
i
introduce
do
it
slocum
you
if
you
want
me
to
but
first
a
word
in
your
he
rose
from
his
seat
and
withdrew
to
a
place
where
he
would
not
be
heard
flimsies
he
said
briefly
ejaculated
barclay
looking
a
trifle
disappointed
he
understood
that
they
were
not
genuine
bills
but
counterfeit
and
what
if
they
are
said
slocum
reading
his
expression
a
risk
about
venture
have
as
my
old
grandmother
used
to
say
just
be
foxy
and
you
get
caught
making
a
good
living
off
of
it
commission
do
you
get
for
passing
them
cents
on
a
dollar
liberal
it
that
is
liberal
barclay
admitted
you
made
anything
today
i
well
i
reckon
i
much
passed
a
ten
and
a
that
gives
you
seven
and
a
half
for
your
share
you
are
barclay
your
knowledge
of
arithmetic
does
credit
to
your
education
plain
your
respected
parent
took
great
pains
with
your
respected
parent
repeated
barclay
frowning
about
the
meanest
old
skinflint
find
within
a
hundred
miles
i
found
him
out
yesterday
and
let
him
know
that
i
was
going
to
call
again
today
to
raise
a
loan
but
when
i
called
the
old
fox
was
gone
bag
and
shabby
way
to
treat
his
offspring
i
pity
you
jim
so
you
are
left
to
the
tender
mercies
of
the
find
very
tender
growled
barclay
you
see
that
and
he
drew
from
his
pocket
about
forty
cents
in
change
but
it
dazzle
all
the
money
i
have
in
the
better
join
barclay
hesitated
quite
like
it
i
care
about
going
up
the
river
again
too
if
you
are
careful
give
you
a
few
points
if
one
of
your
bills
is
found
out
you
are
at
once
searched
to
see
if
you
have
any
the
there
is
but
you
can
guard
against
it
when
i
am
preparing
to
offer
a
bill
i
put
a
number
of
good
bills
in
my
vest
pocket
where
they
will
be
certain
to
be
found
at
once
the
other
counterfeits
i
put
in
a
secret
inside
pocket
where
they
are
not
likely
to
be
discovered
then
when
it
is
found
that
all
the
other
bills
are
good
i
say
that
some
rascal
must
have
passed
the
bad
bill
on
me
taking
advantage
of
my
innocence
and
ignorance
of
the
this
seemed
to
barclay
an
excellent
joke
and
he
laughed
long
and
loud
me
bill
but
you
look
can
when
after
a
little
more
conversation
barclay
who
was
already
half
convinced
yielded
to
the
temptation
and
agreed
to
accompany
his
friend
to
the
secret
office
of
the
counterfeiters
and
enroll
himself
as
one
of
their
agents
slocum
offered
to
conduct
him
within
at
once
the
interview
proved
a
satisfactory
one
and
barclay
was
readily
accepted
being
vouched
for
by
his
friend
and
companion
it
may
be
said
also
that
his
appearance
was
in
his
favor
though
it
would
hardly
have
recommended
him
for
any
honest
business
when
barclay
came
out
of
the
office
and
again
found
himself
on
broadway
his
spirits
were
perceptibly
raised
he
was
no
longer
impecunious
but
carried
with
him
fifty
dollars
in
counterfeit
bills
good
by
jim
said
slocum
is
best
for
us
to
part
and
not
work
near
each
other
then
again
it
is
best
not
to
recognize
each
other
when
we
meet
so
that
if
one
gets
into
a
scrape
the
other
need
not
be
right

success

you
james
barclay
walked
up
broadway
when
all
at
once
he
uttered
a
half
exclamation
indicative
of
astonishment
he
was
nearly
face
to
face
with
a
telegraph
boy
in
whom
he
recognized
the
resolute
lad
who
had
foiled
him
in
his
attempt
at
burglary
but
this
was
not
all
on
the
cap
he
recognized
with
amazement
the
distinctive
inscription
chapter
xvi
an
unexpected
meeting
ejaculated
james
barclay
in
surprise
the
surprise
was
reflected
on
face
when
on
looking
up
he
recognized
james
barclay
think
we
have
met
before
said
the
burglar
grimly
answered
paul
smiling
are
the
boy
that
lives
with
my
father
if
you
are
the
son
of
jerry
barclay
paul
admitted
seeing
that
denial
was
useless
queer
how
things
come
about
said
barclay
reflectively
think
you
will
have
to
excuse
me
said
paul
i
am
sent
on
an
errand
and
it
do
for
me
to
are
you
bound
the
astor
you
going
to
walk
i
will
go
with
you
if
you
paul
was
by
no
means
desirous
of
company
but
there
seemed
no
way
to
shake
him
off
the
street
was
free
to
all
can
come
with
me
if
you
like
he
said
go
got
something
to
say
to
you
but
first
say
that
i
bear
any
ill
will
against
you
for
what
you
did
the
other
night
you
only
did
your
true
glad
you
look
upon
it
in
that
admire
your
pluck
blest
if
i
all
the
same
i
was
you
think
it
would
be
better
to
go
into
some
other
line
of
business
barclay
i
do
but
that
was
all
that
was
open
to
me
at
that
time
now
got
into
something
paul
looked
curious
but
ask
what
that
business
was
he
concluded
that
barclay
would
tell
him
if
he
felt
disposed
a
confidential
agent
continued
barclay
likely
to
pay
me
well
where
has
my
father
moved
to
paul
hesitated
see
you
want
to
tell
me
my
father
moved
to
get
out
of
my
way
i
he
know
as
i
blame
him
much
being
the
kind
of
man
he
is
his
son
but
money
is
his
god
i
asked
for
money
and
he
want
to
give
it
to
what
he
i
was
in
need
of
money
then
now
not
do
you
see
that
he
drew
from
his
vest
pocket
the
roll
of
counterfeit
notes
which
had
been
intrusted
to
him
and
showed
it
to
paul
look
as
if
i
was
in
want
of
money
does
it
it
paul
admitted
in
truth
he
was
surprised
at
this
unexpected
wealth
on
the
part
of
his
companion
and
it
occurred
to
him
to
wonder
whether
he
had
engaged
in
another
burglary
in
which
he
had
been
more
successful
i
get
it
in
the
way
you
think
he
said
answering
suspicious
thought
got
it
in
the
way
of
business
now
will
you
tell
me
where
my
father
lives
without
his
tell
him
that
i
want
any
money
from
him
i
am
able
to
pay
my
own
way
says
he
is
you
believe
him
asked
barclay
think
he
must
have
some
money
answered
paul
cautiously
do
i
decidedly
but
he
can
keep
it
tell
him
that
i
only
want
to
see
him
about
some
family
matters
it
strange
if
a
son
wants
to
have
a
chat
with
his
father
after
twelve
years
is
it
i
should
say
the
old
man
that
i
am
willing
to
give
him
five
dollars
as
a
sign
of
good
faith
if
he
will
give
me
five
hand
him
tell
him
that
said
paul
rather
surprised
and
asking
himself
whether
james
barclay
was
in
earnest
give
me
small
bills
for
a
ten
could
you
asked
barclay
meaning
to
push
his
business
by
help
i
i
carry
any
money
about
with
me
except
a
little
mind
get
it
somewhere
else
will
you
let
me
know
tomorrow
what
my
father
says
call
at
your
office
about
ten
may
be
away
but
if
i
am
not
you
can
see
long
have
you
been
with
my
father
since
i
was
five
or
six
years
made
him
take
you
he
so
very
was
some
money
that
went
with
me
i
have
no
doubt
of
it
the
old
man
is
keen
to
look
out
for
number
one
he
prefers
that
to
looking
out
for
number
ninety
paul
laughed
at
the
joke
though
he
think
it
very
brilliant
you
expect
he
will
leave
you
his
money
questioned
barclay
with
a
sharp
glance
at
paul
i
have
no
claims
upon
true
but
you
might
take
advantage
of
his
being
weak
and
do
you
take
me
for
asked
paul
indignantly
barclay
laughed
take
you
for
an
angel
and
a
few
thousands
might
be
a
temptation
to
you
as
well
as
the
next
you
think
your
father
has
as
much
money
as
that
he
he
has
been
always
scrimping
and
saving
and
never
nothing
to
me
said
paul
you
ask
my
opinion
i
think
never
make
a
will
and
whatever
he
has
will
go
to
his
natural
heir
i
suppose
me
if
dead
got
a
wife
and
two
they
had
reached
barclay
street
and
the
astor
house
was
close
at
hand
must
leave
you
now
said
paul
go
into
the
well
forget
to
tell
my
father
what
i
told
will
do
that
evening
paul
in
redemption
of
his
promise
said
to
the
miser
saw
your
son
today
the
old
face
wore
a
startled
expression
saw
james
he
faltered
he
know
you
lived
with
me
but
i
know
how
he
found
out
perhaps
he
asked
at
our
former
what
did
he
say
asked
where
you
had
tell
him
said
jerry
in
alarm
i
said
i
could
not
without
your
boy
paul
tell
him
ever
he
he
would
come
here
and
ask
for
money
it
would
be
very
foolish
for
i
am
wretchedly
poor
why
you
tell
him
that
paul
think
he
would
believe
me
if
i
did
but
you
are
mistaken
he
says
about
his
wanting
money
he
showed
me
a
roll
of
bills
and
said
he
had
a
good
asked
me
for
fifty
dollars
when
he
came
to
see
me
he
is
a
bold
bad
man
he
says
he
is
willing
to
give
you
money
he
says
if
you
will
give
him
five
dollars
back
he
will
give
you
a
ten
dollar
he
say
that
asked
old
jerry
eagerly
told
me
to
tell
you
old
face
wore
a
look
of
perplexity
he
hated
to
give
up
a
chance
of
five
dollars
but
at
the
same
time
he
felt
afraid
of
his
son
he
could
not
believe
him
to
be
in
earnest
for
such
liberality
was
by
no
means
characteristic
of
him
he
seem
to
be
in
earnest
he
asked
paul
he
seemed
to
be
but
you
know
him
better
than
i
do
he
said
he
wanted
to
have
a
chat
with
you
as
he
had
not
seen
you
for
so
many
years
what
shall
i
say
to
him
old
jerry
immediately
reply
avarice
and
greed
struggled
in
his
mind
with
an
instinctive
fear
of
his
son
think
of
it
he
answered
tell
just
i
say
that
to
him
and
paul
let
him
follow
you
home
and
find
me
out
try
to
do
it
he
is
a
a
bad
man
as
he
was
a
bad
will
do
as
you
say
paul
was
not
sorry
to
carry
back
this
message
for
he
too
mistrusted
james
barclay
and
felt
that
his
desire
to
see
his
father
covered
some
sinister
design
chapter
xvii
a
queer
compact
james
barclay
was
very
much
in
earnest
in
wishing
to
find
his
new
habitation
for
he
was
convinced
that
the
old
man
possessed
a
moderate
fortune
and
he
felt
that
sooner
or
later
it
would
come
to
him
if
in
any
way
he
could
persuade
old
jerry
to
put
it
in
his
hands
now
he
would
be
handsomely
provided
for
he
was
not
to
see
paul
until
the
next
morning
he
secured
lodgings
at
a
low
hotel
on
the
bowery
where
twenty
five
cents
per
night
was
charged
the
accommodation
corresponded
with
the
price
but
barclay
fresh
from
sing
sing
was
not
inclined
to
be
fastidious
and
congratulated
himself
that
again
he
was
a
free
man
he
was
not
unmindful
of
his
business
but
was
on
the
lookout
for
a
chance
to
exchange
his
counterfeit
bills
for
good
ones
he
strolled
into
a
drinking
saloon
and
called
for
a
drink
by
his
side
a
man
from
the
country
apparently
was
just
paying
for
a
glass
of
whisky
and
in
so
doing
displayed
a
wallet
filled
with
bills
barclay
felt
interested
in
him
at
once
friend
he
said
you
drink
with
me
i
hate
to
drink
very
polite
stranger
but
i
hic
i
guess
about
you
can
stand
another
glass
i
am
i
mind
hiccoughed
the
countryman
a
gen
are
you
said
barclay
with
a
wink
at
the
barkeeper
you
have
the
countryman
expressed
a
wish
for
whisky
straight
and
was
served
with
a
glass
then
the
two
sat
down
and
engaged
in
conversation
it
was
evident
from
the
thick
utterance
of
the
gentleman
of
the
rural
districts
that
he
was
no
longer
master
of
himself
the
way
said
barclay
carelessly
you
do
me
a
favor
lend
you
any
money
answered
the
other
with
a
remnant
of
prudence
promised
my
wife
i
i
want
a
loan
said
barclay
you
got
money
enough
but
i
see
got
a
number
of
bills
you
change
a
ten
for
me
the
countryman
saw
no
harm
in
this
and
counted
out
ten
dollars
in
small
bills
for
which
he
accepted
a
nice
crisp
ten
dollar
bill
which
looked
handsome
but
as
we
know
was
not
worth
the
paper
it
was
printed
upon
you
take
another
drink
in
acknowledgment
of
the
favor
asked
barclay
has
saved
my
going
to
the
the
countryman
was
already
so
dizzy
that
he
had
the
good
sense
to
refuse
after
trying
to
balance
himself
on
his
feet
without
success
bid
you
good
day
said
barclay
who
for
obvious
reasons
desired
now
to
terminate
the
acquaintance
day
said
the
other
in
a
husky
voice
was
very
well
done
soliloquized
barclay
as
he
counted
the
good
money
and
put
it
by
itself
in
an
upper
vest
pocket
so
drunk
that
never
know
where
he
got
the
bad
tenner
do
for
one
the
next
morning
a
little
before
the
time
agreed
upon
with
paul
he
was
crossing
the
city
hall
park
when
he
unexpectedly
met
the
telegraph
boy
morning
number
he
said
was
just
coming
up
to
the
office
to
look
for
you
are
saved
the
and
now
what
word
from
my
father
where
can
i
find
him

not
seem
willing
to
see
you
answered
paul
james
barclay
frowned
angrily
believe
doing
this
you
young
rascal
keeping
me
and
the
old
man
apart
so
you
can
get
hold
of
his
money
are
welcome
to
think
what
you
like
barclay
said
paul
with
spirit
morning
the
kid
muttered
barclay
following
the
telegraph
boy
with
a
vindictive
glance
what
i
say
too
boss
barclay
turned
quickly
and
found
the
speaker
to
be
a
bootblack
a
boy
about
size
it
was
tom
rafferty
a
boy
introduced
in
the
first
chapter
with
whose
attempted
imposition
upon
a
smaller
boy
in
the
same
line
of
business
paul
had
forcibly
interfered
you
know
the
kid
he
said
inquiringly
ought
to
answered
tom
yer
boots
boss

a
shine
answered
barclay
thinking
he
might
make
this
boy
of
service
you
like
number
i
was
the
emphatic
reply
the
matter
with
him
thinks
himself
above
me
jest
because
he
is
a
telegraph
boy
and
i
am
a
you
known
him
long
since
he
was
so
high
said
tom
indicating
the
height
of
a
boy
of
six
you
know
the
old
man
he
lives
with
old
jerry
of
course
i
do
used
to
live
in
the
same
house
when

the
boy

the
old
man
but

tom
with
an
eye
to
business
depends
on
how
soon
you

how
can
you
find
out
foller
paul
when
he
goes
home
from

a
tom
had
not
been
expecting
more
than
a
quarter
and
was
very
well
pleased
with
liberality
do
it
boss
he
said
striking
the
box
to
indicate
that
the
shine
was
completed
apart
from
the
money
that
was
promised
him
he
was
glad
to
thwart
paul
who
want
his
customer
to
ascertain
the
address
meet
you
here
about
nine
and
have
another
shine
said
barclay
as
he
slipped
ten
cents
double
pay
into
hand
find
me
on
hand
and
right
side
up
with
care
said
tom
a
gentleman
i
like
to
fall
in
james
barclay
walked
away
well
pleased
with
the
arrangement
he
had
made
one
way
of
finding
out
what
you
want
to
know
he
soliloquized
old
man
sharp
or
else
he
thinks
i
give
him
a
call
when
that
troublesome
telegraph
boy
is
about
his
business
me
and
the
old
man
will
have
considerable
business
to
discuss
going
to
give
me
a
share
of
his
money
or
shake
the
life
out
of
him
it
pleasant
to
discipline
your
dad
but
when
he
treat
you
like
he
ought
the
only
tom
rafferty
towards
the
close
of
the
afternoon
loitered
in
the
neighborhood
of
the
telegraph
office
where
paul
was
employed
when
number
left
the
office
and
betook
himself
homeward
he
did
not
notice
that
he
was
followed
at
the
distance
of
a
few
rods
by
tom
rafferty
but
such
was
the
case
chapter
xviii
james
barclay
obtains
a
clew
no
commission
could
have
been
more
congenial
to
tom
rafferty
than
to
track
paul
and
the
miser
he
had
never
liked
paul
whom
he
charged
with
putting
on
airs
because
he
was
better
dressed
than
himself
but
his
aversion
had
deepened
to
hatred
since
the
telegraph
forcible
interference
in
favor
of
little
jack
he
saw
a
way
now
to
annoy
paul
for
he
was
satisfied
that
james
barclay
was
no
friend
of
jerry
or
number
he
hovered
round
the
telegraph
office
till
paul
was
dismissed
and
then
unobserved
by
him
sauntered
along
behind
him
at
grand
street
paul
crossed
broadway
and
proceeded
eastward
to
where
ludlow
street
opens
out
of
it
and
proceeded
in
a
southerly
direction
for
about
five
minutes
had
he
turned
back
he
might
have
suspected
motive
in
following
him
but
he
was
absorbed
in
his
own
thoughts
and
never
looked
behind
him
at
length
he
entered
an
open
doorway
and
went
upstairs
tom
carefully
noted
the
number
and
then
with
a
look
of
triumph
went
back
to
his
usual
lounging
place
at
the
city
hall
park
the
next
morning
at
the
hour
fixed
james
barclay
entered
the
park
and
looked
about
for
tom
tom
who
was
also
on
the
lookout
for
him
put
himself
in
his
way
yer
boots
boss
he
asked
with
a
grin
the
boy
i
saw
yesterday
said
barclay
recognizing
him
what
luck
have
you
had
follered
him
and
found
out
where
he
lives
said
barclay
brightening
up
is
it
the
dollar
you
was
to
give
me
asked
tom
cautiously
it
is
said
barclay
producing
a
silver
dollar
it
here
tell
me
where
my
where
the
telegraph
boy
i
should
you
might
put
it
back
in
your
pocket
said
tom
cunningly
barclay
did
not
resent
this
imputation
upon
his
good
faith
for
his
sense
of
honor
was
not
very
keen
and
he
would
only
have
regarded
such
a
trick
as
smart
in
this
case
however
he
was
so
anxious
to
learn
where
his
father
lived
that
he
had
no
idea
of
cheating
his
confidential
messenger
boy
on
the
square
he
answered
take
the
money
and
tell
me
the
tom
took
the
dollar
chucked
it
in
the
air
catching
it
dexterously
as
it
came
down
and
then
pocketed
it
with
an
air
of
satisfaction
he
was
neither
provident
nor
industrious
and
it
was
rare
that
he
found
himself
in
possession
of
so
large
a
sum
ludlow
street
he
said
the
you
sure
of
that
did
you
see
the
old
man
demanded
barclay
eagerly
i
see
him
but
i
knowed
he
was
there
for
he
and
paul
live
together
answered
tom
near
grand
street
it
hit
it
boss
shine
yer
boots
ahead
while
this
operation
was
being
performed
tom
whose
curiosity
was
excited
began
to
question
in
his
turn
no
relation
to
paul
be
you
he
asked
business
is
it
of
yours
demanded
barclay
frowning
know
yer
wanted
to
keep
it
secret
said
tom
abashed
you
known
the
old
man
long
knowed
old
jerry
ever
since
i
was
a
small
does
he
make
his
living
begs
in
the
streets
when
he
can
get
away
from
paul
number
is
so
proud
he
let
him
when
he
knows
should
think
he
would
rather
have
the
old
man
beg
so
he
have
to
give
him
so
much
should
i
mind
old
jerry
could
make
enough
begging
to
support
himself
you
are
a
different
chap
from
this
telegraph
boy
observed
barclay
not
without
sarcasm
hope
so
said
tom
rafferty
put
on
no
he
does
better
believe
it
and
after
all
only
a
telegraph
boy
i
could
go
on
the
telegraph
myself
if
i
wanted
you
rather
have
my
liberty
and
be
my
own
boss
i
guess
i
make
as
much
money
any
could
dress
better
and
be
cleaner
suggested
barclay
surveying
the
ragged
costume
and
soiled
face
and
hands
of
the
bootblack
the
use
of
being
clean
asked
tom
with
calm
philosophy
feel
no
better
besides
sure
to
get
dirty
again
all
you
are
my
boy
said
barclay
with
a
smile
much
of
that
foolishness
about
here
the
boy
struck
the
box
smartly
with
his
brush
as
a
sign
that
the
job
was
completed
barclay
put
down
his
foot
and
prepared
to
go
paid
boss
said
the
bootblack
gave
you
a
was
for
something
else
you
paid
for
the
ought
to
throw
that
in
said
barclay
do
business
that
way
your
money
then
said
barclay
throwing
a
nickel
on
the
ground
at
his
feet
he
had
intended
all
the
time
to
give
it
but
amused
himself
by
teasing
the
boy
i
should
want
you
again
shall
i
find
you
here
boss
this
is
my
office
answered
tom
humorously
more
convenient
you
kin
call
at
my
house
on
fifth
james
barclay
left
the
park
in
a
state
of
high
satisfaction
it
was
important
to
his
schemes
to
find
his
father
and
now
there
seemed
to
be
no
further
difficulty
in
the
way
then
too
he
rather
plumed
himself
on
his
success
as
a
detective
old
jerry
prompted
probably
by
paul
had
removed
his
residence
with
the
object
of
avoiding
him
and
putting
him
off
the
track
but
it
had
all
proved
useless
thanks
as
he
assured
himself
to
his
remarkable
sharpness
he
had
foiled
the
old
man
and
found
out
what
he
had
attempted
to
conceal
glum
he
will
look
when
he
sees
me
coming
into
his
room
he
chuckled
to
himself
be
worth
five
dollars
to
see
his
scared
face
serves
him
right
too
for
to
deceive
his
own
flesh
and
it
was
no
little
additional
satisfaction
that
paul
too
against
whom
he
had
a
grudge
for
his
interference
with
his
attempt
at
burglary
would
be
disappointed
and
discomfited
should
he
go
at
once
to
call
on
his
father
by
the
city
hall
clock
it
lacked
a
quarter
of
ten
there
was
no
hurry
for
he
had
his
address
and
could
find
him
any
time
he
wanted
to
make
another
call
first
and
decided
to
do
so
what
this
call
was
is
not
essential
to
my
story
it
is
sufficient
to
say
that
it
occupied
him
two
hours
and
that
it
was
a
little
past
twelve
when
he
reached
the
new
residence
of
his
father
in
ludlow
street
there

old
jerry
receives
a
visit
though
old
jerry
was
more
sensible
than
some
misers
in
resisting
the
temptation
of
keeping
all
his
money
at
home
where
he
might
feast
his
eyes
in
the
contemplation
of
it
he
had
a
little
hoard
of
gold
pieces
which
he
secreted
in
his
room
and
which
from
time
to
time
he
took
out
and
counted
with
gloating
eyes
this
very
day
he
had
taken
them
from
their
place
of
concealment
and
spreading
them
on
the
bed
was
counting
them
over
with
trembling
fingers
when
his
son
quietly
opened
the
door
and
entered
the
room
the
old
man
looked
around
pale
and
alarmed
and
clutched
at
the
gold
in
the
hope
of
hiding
it
before
the
intruder
whoever
it
might
be
could
catch
a
glimpse
of
it
but
he
was
nervous
and
had
only
thrust
a
part
of
the
gold
hurriedly
into
his
pocket
when
james
entered
over
the
old
face
there
crept
an
expression
of
dire
dismay
there
was
no
one
in
the
world
whom
he
less
wished
to
see
than
his
son
the
keen
glance
detected
his
employment
and
did
not
fail
to
observe
the
half
dozen
gold
pieces
still
remaining
on
the
bed
spread
though
old
jerry
as
quickly
as
possible
gathered
them
up
and
thrust
them
into
his
pocket
morning
dad
said
james
in
a
jocular
tone
am
afraid
you
are
not
glad
to
see
old
jerry
stared
at
him
in
mute
consternation
that
i
am
your
only
son
you
might
give
me
a
better
welcome
said
james
carefully
closing
the
door
and
sinking
into
a
chair
away
go
away
said
the
old
man
hoarsely
you
are
a
bold
bad
man
and
i
want
to
see
dad
that
is
unkind
said
james
barclay
in
a
bantering
tone
forget
that
i
am
your
wish
i
could
forget
it
muttered
the
old
man
am
not
so
bad
as
you
think
i
am
father
seeing
that
we
are
all
that
is
left
of
the
family
only
right
that
we
should
live
friendly
glad
to
see
you
are
not
so
poor
as
you
you
are
mistaken
james
whined
old
jerry
am
very
go
down
dad
what
were
you
doing
when
i
came
in
old
jerry
looked
confused
many
gold
pieces
have
you
got
there
let
me
count
or
four
stammered
jerry
unable
to
deny
the
statement
entirely
or
four
repeated
james
mockingly
or
forty
more
you
are
quite
wrong
james
said
jerry
in
nervous
alarm
all
i
have
in
the
it
is
and
perhaps
it
when
i
was
here
before
you
pretended
you
have
any
money
at
all
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
it
am
keeping
it
to
to
bury
me
answered
jerry
better
give
it
to
me
you
bury
yourself
you
know
see
you
buried
all
right
when
the
time
do
it
james
i
must
keep
it
as
long
as
i
live
when
i
die
comes
to
me
i
i
might
as
well
have
it
now
you
think
so
dad
away
i
feel
well
i
want
to
be
left
alone
stammered
jerry
with
a
terrified
look
at
the
stout
broad
shouldered
visitor
whom
he
could
hardly
believe
to
be
his
son
so
great
was
the
difference
between
the
burly
strength
of
the
one
and
the
shrinking
weakness
of
the
other
here
dad
you
treating
me
well
you
seem
to
consider
that
i
am
your
only
son
are
you
saving
up
your
money
for
that
young
telegraph
brat
that
lives
with
you
is
a
good
boy
mumbled
jerry
scare
and
trouble
me
like
you
answering
my
question
are
you
going
to
leave
him
all
your
money
i
have
very
little
to
leave
james
returned
the
old
man
lapsing
into
his
usual
whine
be
anything
left
when
my
funeral
expenses
are
there
is
will
go
to
me
will
it
i
suppose
so
faltered
jerry
i
think
better
make
your
will
and
say
so
otherwise
that
boy
will
claim
is
a
good
boy
i
i
should
starve
but
for
what
he
brings
me
every
look
half
starved
as
it
is
come
are
you
willing
to
make
your
will
in
my
favor
think
of
it
give
it
to
me
to
it
do
you
any
good
i
i
am
so
take
the
chance
of
that
got
more
money
in
your
pocket
than
would
bury
you
five
times
no
protested
the
old
man
in
alarm
you
frighten
me
james
i
feel
well
you
go
away
is
no
need
to
be
scared
dad
i
want
your
that
true
james
said
the
old
man
in
a
tone
of
relief
have
so
little
it
do
you
any
that
boy
tell
you
i
wanted
to
make
you
a
present
he
said
you
hid
away
from
me
and
let
me
know
where
you
paul
tell
you
how
did
you
find
me
out
james
he
tell
me
but
i
found
out
all
the
same
never
mind
how
only
i
warn
you
it
do
you
any
good
to
hide
from
me
in
future
i
have
ways
of
finding
you
out
but
let
me
convince
you
that
i
need
your
money
do
you
see
that
as
he
spoke
he
drew
out
a
roll
of
counterfeit
bills
and
exhibited
them
to
the
astonished
eyes
of
old
jerry
the
old
man
regarded
him
with
new
respect
as
the
possessor
of
such
unexpected
wealth
are
they
square
he
asked
course
they
are
answered
james
intended
to
give
you
a
present
if
you
treated
me
so
coolly
meant
no
offense
james
said
the
old
man
eying
the
money
with
a
look
of
greed
if
you
apologize
all
right
said
james
with
noble
magnanimity
find
you
judged
me
right
i
can
do
more
for
you
than
that
telegraph
kid
but
i
want
you
to
trust
me
and
treat
me
kind
do
hear
answered
jerry
meekly
show
you
that
in
earnest
make
you
a
fair
offer
give
me
two
of
those
five
dollar
gold
pieces
and
give
you
these
two
ten
dollar
bills
if
that
a
handsome
offer
i
know
what
jerry
was
dazzled
by
this
offer
the
fact
that
it
was
made
by
such
a
scapegrace
as
he
knew
his
son
to
be
should
have
put
him
on
his
guard
but
cupidity
blinded
him
you
mean
it
james
he
asked
surveying
the
bills
with
avidity
i
do
i
make
the
present
just
to
show
you
that
i
bear
no
grudge
and
want
to
live
me
see
the
bills
take
them
in
your
hand
if
you
old
jerry
took
the
bills
and
eyed
them
at
first
longingly
but
as
he
marked
their
new
appearance
a
suspicion
entered
his
mind
if
they
were
counterfeit
his
unexpected
liberal
offer
would
be
accounted
for
character
too
made
it
very
probable
that
he
would
engage
in
circulating
counterfeit
bills
i
would
rather
keep
the
gold
james
he
said
handing
back
the
bills
a
fool
said
james
barclay
roughly
see
you
want
to
be
friendly
i
wanted
to
be
on
good
terms
with
you
my
father
but
now
i
care
give
me
that
gold
away
said
the
old
man
in
renewed
alarm
james
reply
was
to
rise
from
his
seat
and
stride
over
to
where
his
father
was
sitting
on
the
bed
he
seized
the
old
man
roughly
by
the
shoulder
and
made
a
motion
to
search
the
pocket
containing
the
gold
pieces
it
up
peaceably
or
hurt
you
he
said
jerry
uttered
a
shrill
cry
and
tried
to
make
a
feeble
opposition
but
he
was
like
a
child
in
the
hands
of
the
burly
ruffian
your
whimpering
said
james
fiercely
gold
i
mean
to
have
and
best
give
it
jerry
again
uttered
a
cry
which
was
heard
by
hogan
an
opposite
neighbor
who
opening
the
door
saw
unnoticed
by
either
the
uneven
struggle
between
jerry
and
his
assailant
hogan
was
a
brave
woman
she
dashed
back
into
her
own
room
and
returned
in
an
instant
with
a
dipper
of
hot
water
armed
with
this
she
was
prepared
for
hostilities
the
old
man
alone
you
thafe
of
the
worruld
she
exclaimed
indignantly
james
barclay
turned
and
seeing
that
it
was
a
woman
replied
scornfully
out
of
here
woman
or
be
the
worse
for
you
chapter

james
barclay
comes
to
grief
out
yourself
retorted
hogan
as
with
undaunted
mien
she
faced
the
ruffian
are
you
to
old
jerry
your
business
woman
and
leave
the
room
if
you
want
to
get
hurt
james
barclay
still
retained
his
grip
upon
the
old
man
as
he
spoke
he
was
as
bold
as
his
father
was
timid
and
did
not
mean
to
be
frightened
away
by
a
woman
no
more
a
woman
than
yourself
said
hogan
angrily
who
preferred
to
be
addressed
as
a
lady
dressed
like
one
any
way
rejoined
barclay
with
a
smile
of
amusement
father
and
i
have
a
little
business
together
and
not
he
your
son
jerry
asked
hogan
not
certain
whether
the
statement
was
true
answered
jerry
feebly
he
wants
to
rob
me
take
him
away
you
ashamed
of
yourself
to
trate
your
old
father
so
manely
demanded
hogan
indignantly
me
the
money
father
and
go
said
barclay
thinking
it
politic
to
get
away
as
soon
as
possible
him
away
said
old
jerry
feebly
do
it
responded
hogan
tache
him
the
thafe
she
suited
the
action
to
the
word
and
dashed
the
scalding
hot
water
into
the
face
of
james
barclay
he
uttered
a
hoarse
cry
of
mingled
rage
and
pain
and
leaving
his
father
dashed
after
his
bold
assailant
he
was
partially
blinded
however
by
the
pain
and
she
easily
escaped
scarcely
knowing
where
he
went
he
ran
against
an
athletic
broad
shouldered
man
who
was
bringing
up
a
basket
of
coal
your
game
is
it
said
the
newcomer
fancying
the
assault
intentional
know
who
you
are
but
give
ye
all
ye
want
no
man
can
hit
dennis
widout
as
good
as
he
in
a
trice
the
two
men
were
grappling
and
losing
their
balance
tumbled
down
the
stairs
receiving
some
hard
knocks
on
the
way
the
result
was
that
both
were
arrested
by
a
passing
policeman
and
locked
up
james
barclay
whose
burns
were
severe
was
sent
to
the
hospital
on
the
island
and
it
was
thirty
days
before
he
was
free
to
pursue
his
plans
again
old
jerry
picking
himself
up
after
his
narrow
escape
carefully
counted
his
gold
pieces
and
to
his
great
relief
found
that
none
were
missing
he
breathed
a
sigh
of
relief
when
he
learned
that
his
son
had
been
arrested
and
determined
to
deposit
his
gold
in
the
savings
bank
so
as
to
guard
against
future
robbery
it
was
about
this
time
that
paul
called
up
town
by
some
errand
was
crossing
madison
square
when
he
heard
his
name
called
looking
up
he
recognized
with
no
little
pleasure
the
smiling
face
of
jennie
cunningham
she
was
accompanied
by
a
boy
of
about
size
fashionably
dressed
and
wearing
an
expression
of
high
self
appreciation
on
his
rather
narrow
face
are
you
paul
an
age
since
i
saw
you
said
the
young
heiress
cordially
offering
her
hand

glad
to
see
you

jennie
responded
paul

been
expecting

a
long

time

said
paul
i
want
my
revenge
when
will
you
come
i
am
invited
said
paul
smiling
reminds
me
how
stupid
i
was
to
forget
it
that
i
am
to
have
a
fancy
dress
party
of
young
people
next
wednesday
evening
come
you
am
afraid
i

no

a
you
are
to
come
in
costume
come
as
a
telegraph
boy
that
will
be
the
very
thing
act
the
character
naturally
you
know
and
no
one
will
know
that
you
are
a
real
telegraph
should
like
very
much
to
come
if
i
can
come
in
my
just
what
i
want

then
wednesday

at
eight

the
number
of
your
office

send
you
a
regular
card
of
invitation
then
you
will
be
treated
just
like
the
she
was
about
to
turn
away
when
a
thought
struck
her
i
forgot
to
introduce
you
to
my
cousin
mark
sterling
mark
this
is
paul
parton
the
boy
who
drove
off
the
burglar
when
papa
was
gone
to
washington
heard
me
speak
of
him
yes
heard
of
him
said
mark
coldly
behaved
in
a
very
creditable
way
for
a
telegraph
boy
he
continued
in
a
patronizing
tone
for
any
other
boy
rejoined
jennie
quickly
i
look
upon
paul
quite
as
a
am
afraid
i
am
not
entitled
to
such
high
praise
said
paul
modestly
must
make
allowances
for
my
cousin
jennie
said
mark
is
a
girl
and
girls
are
all
apt
to
particular
girl
mark
said
his
cousin
indignantly
you
ever
seen
the
burglar
since
paul
tell
me
you
have
him
arrested
was
no
policeman
at
hand
besides
i
told
him
that
night
that
if
he
would
go
peaceably
i
would
not
molest
a
promise
count
said
mark
in
a
tone
of
authority
should
have
called
a
promise
always
counts
said
paul
firmly
if
given
to
a
burglar
said
mark
with
a
sneer
even
if
given
to
a
mark
took
off
his
hat
mockingly
i
prepared
to
find
such
a
lofty
sense
of
honor
in
a
telegraph
boy
he
said
with
a
satirical
smile
am
afraid
you
are
not
very
well
acquainted
with
telegraph
boys
said
paul
good
naturedly
he
quite
understood
that
mark
meant
to
sneer
at
him
but
being
confident
of
jennie
favor
he
felt
quite
indifferent
to
the
opinion
of
her
cousin
said
mark
significantly
have
never
had
the
honor
of
associating
much
with
that
class
of
mark
make
yourself
so
disagreeable
said
jennie
unceremoniously
that
paul
is
a
particular
friend
of
you
miss
jennie
said
paul
gratefully
was
not
aware
of
that
said
mark
stiffly
am
afraid
i
must
be
going
my
time
is
not
my
own
said
paul
morning
miss
jennie
good
morning
jennie
cunningham
responded
cordially
but
mark
affected
not
to
hear
the
telegraph
farewell
he
was
not
in
the
best
of
humor
having
a
partiality
for
his
pretty
cousin
and
being
disposed
to
regard
with
jealousy
any
kindness
bestowed
by
her
upon
other
boys
he
was
foolish
enough
to
venture
upon
a
remonstrance
without
reflecting
that
this
was
the
poorest
possible
way
of
recommending
himself
to
the
favor
of
his
companion
he
commenced
am
very
much
surprised
at
the
notice
you
take
of
that
low
telegraph
you
mean
paul
parton
if
that
is
the
i
wish
you
to
understand
that
he
is
not
a
low
do
you
know
of
him
what
do
you
know
of
his
family
except
that
he
has
neither
father
nor
mother
they
were
low
probably
know
well
enough
that
nice
boys
become
telegraph
is
a
nice
boy
asserted
jennie
with
spirit
seem
to
be
infatuated
with
him
said
mark
shrugging
his
shoulders
i
treat
him
with
common
politeness
you
invite
him
to
your
party
next
wednesday
i
did
you
think
it
suitable
to
have
a
boy
like
that
among
your
guests
i
believe
your
mother
will
approve
of
mother
invited
paul
to
spend
the
evening
whenever
he
had
this
rather
took
mark
by
surprise
he
could
not
very
well
say
anything
in
condemnation
of
his
aunt
though
he
chose
to
lecture
his
cousin
hope
you
expect
me
to
take
any
notice
of
him
he
said
with
dignity
i
think
he
will
insist
upon
it
i
will
take
care
that
he
feels
himself
at
mark
did
not
venture
to
say
more
but
walked
beside
his
cousin
in
a
disgusted
frame
of
mind
i
am
afraid
he
was
really
jealous
of
paul
whom
against
his
will
he
was
forced
to
admit
to
be
a
very
good
looking
boy
chapter
xxi
the
fancy
dress
party
paul
might
have
hesitated
about
accepting
the
invitation
to
attend
a
fashionable
party
if
he
had
not
been
on
such
cordial
and
friendly
terms
with
his
young
hostess
and
her
family
he
was
sure
to
be
kindly
treated
by
them
and
by
the
majority
of
the
guests
who
very
properly
follow
the
lead
of
their
entertainers
he
foresaw
that
mark
would
snub
him
if
he
had
an
opportunity
but
for
this
he
cared
little
it
was
clear
that
mark
was
foolishly
puffed
up
with
an
idea
of
his
own
consequence
and
had
been
accustomed
to
look
with
scorn
upon
all
who
were
not
on
the
same
social
plane
as
himself
paul
had
for
some
time
been
thinking
of
ordering
another
and
newer
uniform
and
thought
it
good
policy
to
do
so
at
once
that
he
might
have
the
new
suit
to
wear
for
the
first
time
at
jennie
party
it
is
the
custom
for
boys
to
obtain
them
from
the
company
paying
by
installments
or
regular
weekly
deductions
from
their
pay
the
next
morning
some
surprise
was
excited
at
the
office
by
the
receipt
of
a
square
envelope
of
perfumed
french
paper
directed
to
paul
parton
no
love
letter
i
suppose
said
the
chief
with
a
smile
as
he
handed
the
note
to
paul
paul
opened
it
and
having
no
reason
for
secrecy
passed
it
to
the
superintendent
invitation
to
a
fancy
dress
party
said
that
official
in
surprise
seem
to
be
pretty
thick
with
the
cunninghams
number
are
very
polite
and
kind
said
paul
suppose
you
are
trying
to
ingratiate
yourself
with
the
young
am
too
young
to
think
of
that
answered
the
telegraph
boy
very
sensibly
you
accept
the
invitation
must
go
in
fancy
have
already
decided
to
go
as
a
telegraph
you
knew
of
this
before
met
miss
jennie
yesterday
in
madison
square
and
was
told
she
meant
to
invite
are
a
lucky
i
think
from
that
time
paul
was
treated
with
greater
consideration
in
the
office
the
chief
regarding
him
as
a
of
the
cunninghams
this
was
an
advantage
for
he
was
now
employed
on
the
most
agreeable
and
desirable
commissions
that
came
to
the
office
on
wednesday
morning
paul
said
to
old
jerry
shall
be
home
late
tonight
paul
will
you
be
kept
at
the
office
i
am
to
attend
a
jerry
opened
his
eyes
party
where
paul
fifty
first
street
it
is
a
fancy
dress
how
came
they
to
invite
you
employed
me
on
one
occasion
and
have
treated
me
in
a
friendly
way
understand
it
paul
is
it
a
a
rich
family
the
old
eyes
lighted
up
hopefully
they
are
good
friends
of
yours
paul
he
asked
grand
yes
paul
you
can
do
me
a
great
favor
you
will
you
pleaded
the
old
man
coaxingly
is
it
inquired
paul
suspiciously
them
how
poor
i
am
paul
and
ask
them
if
they
help
me
it
would
be
nothing
to
rich
folks
to
send
an
old
man
ten
dollars
or
twenty
and
would
do
me
a
sight
of
must
be
crazy
to
ask
me
such
a
thing
answered
paul
sternly
you
no
shame
or
do
you
think
i
have
none
to
beg
money
of
strangers
i
am
so
poor
paul
whined
the
miser
am
tired
of
hearing
of
that
jerry
said
the
boy
with
an
expression
of
disgust
on
his
face
was
bad
enough
when
i
believed
you
to
be
really
poor
but
now
that
i
know
you
to
have
plenty
of
money
and
are
very
likely
rich
it
makes
me
sick
to
hear
you
tell
such
this
the
way
you
talk
to
a
poor
old
man
who
has
brought
you
up
whined
old
jerry
paul
was
in
no
wise
moved
by
this
appeal
he
knew
too
well
the
extent
of
his
obligations
to
the
old
miser
have
always
paid
my
way
jerry
he
said
coldly
when
i
was
only
six
years
old
i
earned
all
i
cost
you
if
you
think
i
am
any
expense
to
you
i
am
willing
to
leave
you
any
no
paul
said
old
jerry
in
alarm
spare
you
i
am
getting
old
and
i
want
to
be
left
ask
me
to
do
what
i
am
ashamed
of
paul
arrived
at
the
party
about
twenty
minutes
after
eight
he
did
not
care
to
be
among
the
first
in
attendance
he
was
shown
upstairs
to
the
reception
room
and
having
adjusted
his
toilet
went
downstairs
jennie
and
her
mother
stood
at
one
end
of
the
drawing
room
paul
made
his
way
towards
her
and
following
the
example
of
other
guests
shook
hands
and
offered
congratulations
for
it
was
birthday
am
glad
to
see
you
paul
said
jennie
with
a
smile
and
her
mother
echoed
the
welcome
turning
away
paul
met
the
eyes
of
mark
sterling
bent
upon
him
with
a
satirical
look
evening
said
paul
politely
on
hand
said
mark
not
over
courteously
you
see
answered
paul
coolly
is
a
fine
costume
of
mark
sustained
the
character
of
a
young
highland
chieftain
his
dress
being
quite
costly
he
answered
his
vanity
gratified
even
by
a
compliment
from
a
telegraph
boy
got
a
new
suit
you
is
a
pity
you
went
to
such
an
expense
no
one
is
likely
to
take
much
notice
of
a
telegraph
i
shall
use
it
on
duty
answered
paul
are
very
considerate
for
let
me
introduce
you
to
miss
grace
de
vere
said
cunningham
paul
bowed
politely
to
a
pretty
brunette
of
fourteen
dressed
as
a
flower
girl
we
promenade
asked
paul
observing
that
many
of
the
guests
were
walking
in
couples
if
you
like
i
suppose
it
is
very
appropriate
for
a
telegraph
boy
and
a
flower
girl
to
walk
together
said
grace
laughing
a
very
natural
telegraph
boy
you
make
where
did
you
get
the
uniform
did
you
borrow
it
of
a
real
telegraph
boy
answered
paul
had
it
made
expressly
for
suppose
that
is
better
i
hired
my
suit
of
a
as
paul
and
grace
were
promenading
they
met
mark
escorting
a
pale
sallow
girl
with
a
long
nose
but
very
expensively
dressed
as
a
maid
of
honor
mark
turned
up
his
nose
but
looked
rather
envious
nevertheless
for
grace
de
vere
was
not
only
pretty
but
of
high
family
he
said
something
to
his
companion
and
both
stared
impertinently
at
paul
you
know
mark
sterling
asked
grace
a
like
him
at
all
he
is
awfully
disagreeable
he
looks
as
if
he
like
think
he
does
can
you
tell
me
the
name
of
the
young
lady
with
him
is
irene
braddon
do
you
admire
her
prefer
my
present
partner
said
paul
you
you
are
very
gallant
still
it
much
of
a
compliment
irene
belongs
to
a
rich
family
but
she
is
disagreeable
and
few
like
mark
an
admirer
of
hers
likes
to
be
seen
with
her
because
she
is
of
a
rich
and
prominent
family
but
he
likes
his
cousin
jennie
cunningham
best
he
is
jealous
of
every
boy
who
pays
her
any
attention
but
i
want
to
ask
you
a
question
why
have
i
never
met
you
before
at
any
parties
i
am
sure
i
should
have
remembered
is
the
first
party
i
ever
how
can
that
be
i
am
really
what
i
represent
a
telegraph
paul
watched
the
face
of
his
young
companion
closely
fearing
that
this
revelation
would
cut
him
off
from
her
favor
mean
to
say
that
you
are
the
telegraph
boy
that
frightened
away
the
burglar
inquired
grace
eagerly
believe
i
you
are
quite
a
hero
exclaimed
grace
enthusiastically
no
answered
paul
modestly
take
much
grace
asked
paul
a
great
many
questions
and
did
not
seem
at
all
shocked
to
learn
that
she
was
escorted
by
a
common
telegraph
boy
grace
said
jennie
after
a
while
have
you
two
monopolize
each
other
my
cousin
mark
solicits
the
honor
of
escorting
you
paul
if
you
are
a
very
good
boy
you
may
walk
with
you
know
miss
grace
said
mark
you
were
walking
with
a
real
telegraph
boy
he
told
me
am
surprised
that
my
cousin
jennie
should
have
invited
him
am
not
at
all
i
think
him
the
handsomest
boy
at
the
is
no
accounting
for
taste
rejoined
mark
very
much
disgusted
at
this
laudation
of
a
boy
he
despised
is
so
agreeable
too
added
grace
with
malicious
pleasure
at
her
discomfiture
has
plenty
of
cheek
said
mark
tries
to
make
himself
very
conspicuous
it
would
be
better
taste
to
stand
quietly
in
a
later
in
the
evening
paul
became
more
conspicuous
and
mark
became
still
more
disgusted
with
him
chapter
xxii
the
young
minstrels
about
half
past
nine
jennie
beckoned
paul
to
come
into
the
back
parlor
which
was
comparatively
deserted
am
going
to
ask
a
favor
of
you
she
said
shall
be
glad
to
do
anything
you
wish
said
paul
earnestly
am
preparing
a
surprise
for
the
company
something
not
down
in
the
programme
i
ask
you
to
help
me
because
you
can
paul
blushed
call
it
singing
he
said
modestly
am
sure
you
have
a
very
nice
voice
paul
now
i
will
tell
you
what
i
want
you
and
i
are
to
dress
as
italian
street
singers
i
have
a
harp
on
which
i
can
play
a
little
we
will
come
in
as
soon
as
we
are
ready
and
surprise
the
it
be
necessary
to
sing
in
italian
asked
paul
with
a
smile
have
forgotten
all
know
as
much
as
i
do
we
will
sing
some
of
the
popular
ballads
here
is
a
list
which
i
have
written
down
do
you
know
them
paul
looked
over
the
list
and
selected
three
which
he
felt
able
to
sing
well
said
jennie
with
satisfaction
will
find
your
suit
ready
in
your
dressing
room
i
have
spoken
to
one
of
the
boys
arthur
constable
to
go
up
and
assist
you
now
will
you
be
ready
in
fifteen
minutes
answered
paul
confidently
wonder
what
jennie
and
the
telegraph
boy
are
talking
about
so
earnestly
thought
mark
with
a
scowl
for
he
had
just
noticed
their
conversation
never
suspected
that
jennie
had
such
low
an
unpleasant
frown
gathered
on
face
which
he
made
no
attempt
to
conceal
he
was
getting
to
dislike
paul
more
and
more
next
the
two
whose
intimacy
had
provoked
his
discontent
left
the
room
and
his
anger
increased
presently
however
cunningham
entered
the
room
and
said
with
a
smile
people
i
have
engaged
the
services
of
two
italian
minstrels
who
will
try
to
entertain
you
for
a
short
instantly
there
was
a
hush
of
expectation
for
the
announcement
was
understood
literally
the
door
was
thrown
open
and
paul
and
jennie
entered
paul
wore
a
suit
of
black
velvet
and
a
hat
also
of
velvet
in
which
it
must
be
admitted
he
looked
very
handsome
jennie
was
attired
also
in
a
characteristic
national
costume
and
carried
in
her
hand
a
harp
as
they
entered
together
most
of
the
company
agreed
that
they
made
a
very
attractive
picture
they
advanced
hand
in
hand
till
they
reached
a
position
at
the
head
of
the
room
then
jennie
struck
her
harp
and
the
two
began
to
sing
a
favorite
melody
their
voices
according
remarkably
well
there
was
a
sound
of
applause
at
the
end
of
the
first
song
paul
bowed
and
taking
his
hat
from
his
head
gravely
made
the
round
of
the
guests
pennies
were
dropped
by
such
as
had
them
when
paul
reached
mark
he
was
tempted
to
pass
him
by
for
he
saw
the
scornful
smile
upon
his
face
but
he
did
not
care
to
make
a
scene
and
held
out
his
cap
to
him
as
well
as
the
rest
mark
dropped
in
a
penny
for
the
monkey
he
said
in
a
significant
tone
it
you
said
paul
with
unruffled
good
humor
for
he
felt
that
he
could
afford
to
be
good
natured
liberality
is
mark
bit
his
lips
foolishly
taking
offense
at
this
good
natured
retort
another
song
was
vociferously
called
for
and
given
then
a
third
was
demanded
and
the
two
minstrels
retired
amid
a
volley
of
plaudits
was
perfectly
charming
said
grace
de
vere
enthusiastically
a
nice
looking
boy
that
paul
parton
is
he
looked
perfectly
lovely
in
his
velvet
the
boy
to
whom
this
was
addressed
was
mark
sterling
and
it
may
well
be
believed
that
it
was
far
from
pleasing
him
you
falling
in
love
with
him
he
asked
with
a
sneer
do
believe
i
am
answered
grace
tell
him
though
am
not
likely
to
the
fellow
is
conceited
enough
mark
you
are
too
bad
to
me
he
seems
remarkably
ought
to
have
more
sense
than
to
push
himself
forward
so
being
only
a
telegraph
care
what
he
is
he
is
very
nice
and
very
good
suppose
you
admire
his
singing
too
he
has
a
sweet
a
matter
of
do
believe
jealous
of
him
mark
you
like
it
because
jennie
ask
you
to
take
the
this
was
really
true
for
mark
fancied
himself
a
singer
though
his
voice
was
thin
and
shrill
had
he
taken
part
the
effect
would
have
been
ludicrous
but
of
course
he
had
no
idea
of
this
it
so
happened
that
he
knew
the
three
songs
which
had
been
sung
and
he
was
very
much
annoyed
to
have
been
passed
over
in
what
was
the
pronounced
success
of
the
evening
and
to
see
a
mere
telegraph
boy
selected
instead
of
him
of
a
telegraph
boy
repeated
mark
with
a
scornful
inflection
am
not
sunk
quite
so
low
as
about
eleven
the
party
broke
up
being
a
juvenile
party
it
was
not
kept
up
as
late
as
if
it
had
been
attended
by
older
persons
paul
took
his
leave
with
the
rest
feeling
that
he
had
enjoyed
himself
uncommonly
well
must
thank
you
for
a
pleasant
evening
miss
jennie
he
said
as
he
said
adieu
to
his
youthful
hostess
did
your
part
towards
making
it
so
you
for
the
forget
to
come
soon
to
see
us
said
jennie
giving
her
hand
to
paul
paul
bowed
his
thanks
and
left
the
house
with
three
or
four
others
in
his
company
among
them
was
mark
sterling
do
you
live
asked
mark
abruptly
town
answered
paul
shortly
he
felt
reluctant
to
say
that
he
lived
in
ludlow
street
although
he
conjectured
rightly
that
mark
would
have
no
idea
where
it
was
situated
thought
perhaps
you
might
live
on
fifth
at
present
that
may
come
mark
laughed
disdainfully
you
give
a
party
i
hope
you
will
do
us
all
the
honor
to
send
an
you
accept
i
think
i
will
bear
it
in
mind
now
let
me
bid
you
all
good
mark
was
disappointed
to
find
that
not
one
of
his
companions
would
join
in
his
sarcasms
against
the
telegraph
boy
all
thought
him
very
agreeable
and
very
handsome
and
mark
was
at
last
obliged
to
give
up
his
attack
and
lapse
into
sullenness
paul
walked
to
sixth
avenue
though
that
was
not
the
most
direct
route
homewards
and
in
place
of
taking
a
car
walked
slowly
down
the
avenue
it
was
a
pleasant
night
and
he
felt
broad
awake
and
by
no
means
fatigued
it
seemed
to
him
pleasanter
to
walk
part
of
the
way
at
least
as
he
walked
he
fell
into
serious
thought
he
had
left
an
elegant
house
crowded
with
a
gay
and
fashionable
company
and
he
was
going
where
to
a
miserable
tenement
house
in
which
he
shared
a
poor
and
ill
furnished
room
with
a
squalid
and
miserly
old
man
in
appearance
not
above
a
tramp
certainly
the
contrast
was
a
startling
one
as
he
dwelt
upon
it
paul
felt
more
and
more
disgusted
with
his
home
and
surroundings
i
live
in
a
refined
house
among
refined
people
he
asked
himself
feel
much
more
at
home
with
them
than
with
old
jerry
must
i
always
live
a
beggar
mental
answer
was
an
emphatic
he
was
young
and
hopeful
the
world
was
before
him
he
was
poor
but
other
poor
boys
had
raised
themselves
from
poverty
as
great
and
he
felt
that
there
was
an
equal
chance
for
him
his
reflections
were
interrupted
by
the
sight
of
a
tall
young
man
not
far
in
advance
whose
unsteady
gait
showed
that
he
was
under
the
influence
of
liquor
chapter

a
sight

means
uncommon
in
a
large
city
and
of
course
paul
had
witnessed
it
many
times
but
for
one
circumstance
he
would
have
given
the
young
man
a
passing
glance
and
gone
on
but
he
observed
that
the
young
man
was
followed
the
person
following
was
also
a
young
man
rather
flashily
attired
and
as
paul
thought
of
suspicious
appearance
it
seemed
to
him
clear
that
he
had
designs
upon
the
first
young
man
whose
condition
was
likely
to
make
him
an
easy
prey
to
an
unscrupulous
acquaintance
have
i
seen
that
man
before
thought
paul
he
was
puzzled
for
a
moment
and
then
he
remembered
that
he
had
strayed
one
day
into
a
court
room
and
seen
him
as
a
prisoner
at
the
bar
charged
with
picking
a
pocket
what
after
now
thought
paul
will
prevent
him
if
i
the
telegraph
boy
moderated
his
pace
so
as
not
to
attract
the
attention
of
the
man
in
the
rear
but
kept
a
close
watch
over
him
finally
the
pickpocket
came
to
a
sudden
resolution
and
quickening
his
pace
came
up
with
the
man
he
was
following
me
my
friend
he
said
smoothly
i
see
you
are
in
need
of
assistance
you
take
my
arm
take
you
home
if
you
very
good
said
the
stranger
been
drinking
more
than
is
good
for
me
all
do
that
sometimes
said
his
new
acquaintance
been
there
myself
where
are
you
staying
the
albemarle
hotel
am
i
going
the
right
way
got
turned
round
i
you
are
on
the
right
track
i
live
close
by
your
hotel
myself
so
i
can
go
along
with
you
just
as
well
as
you
are
really
very
mention
the
other
made
no
objection
to
the
pickpocket
passing
his
arm
through
his
and
the
two
walked
on
together
means
to
rob
him
thought
paul
can
i
do
to
prevent
it
he
quite
like
to
make
an
accusation
though
he
remembered
the
face
perfectly
till
he
had
some
ground
for
warning
the
intended
victim
it
might
be
that
the
pickpocket
was
merely
taking
the
part
of
the
good
samaritan
though
it
was
by
no
means
probable
the
two
men
became
sociable
and
paul
was
near
enough
to
hear
fragments
of
the
conversation
he
gathered
that
the
stranger
was
from
louis
that
he
was
visiting
new
york
on
a
business
errand
representing
a
firm
of
which
his
father
was
the
head
the
pickpocket
who
had
been
waiting
only
till
he
could
gain
the
confidence
now
felt
that
it
was
time
to
be
carrying
out
his
plans
with
dexterous
fingers
he
managed
to
explore
the
pocket
of
his
companion
and
paul
caught
sight
quick
as
he
was
of
his
appropriation
of
his
wallet
shall
have
to
leave
you
here
said
he
abruptly
having
no
further
motive
for
continuing
the
companionship
night
night
said
the
stranger
to
lose
your
company
paul
was
excited
as
he
might
well
be
for
he
saw
that
on
him
alone
depended
the
frustration
of
the
plans
thief
he
exclaimed
in
a
loud
voice
the
thief
looked
startled
and
turning
into
thirty
seventh
street
ran
towards
fifth
avenue
paul
followed
in
close
pursuit
that
wallet
or
it
will
be
worse
for
you
exclaimed
the
undaunted
boy
had
the
night
been
dark
the
thief
would
have
taken
the
chances
and
retained
his
booty
but
he
was
sure
to
attract
attention
and
might
any
minute
run
into
the
arms
of
a
policeman
the
risk
was
too
great
curse
you
he
muttered
throwing
down
the
wallet
stop
following
me
paul
picked
up
the
pocketbook
and
ceased
the
pursuit
he
had
accomplished
all
he
intended
and
was
willing
to
let
the
thief
go
free
now
that
he
had
restored
his
plunder
he
retraced
his
steps
to
sixth
avenue
where
he
found
the
stranger
waiting
for
him
is
your
pocketbook
he
said
have
had
a
narrow
jove
i
should
think
i
had
answered
the
young
man
much
money
do
you
think
there
is
in
that
wallet
it
a
large
sum
asked
paul
his
curiosity
aroused
hundred
dollars
perhaps
a
little
more
a
brave
boy
but
for
you
i
should
have
lost
am
very
glad
to
have
been
of
such
service
said
paul
the
thief
only
knew
what
a
purse
he
had
lost
he
would
feel
like
murdering
made
you
suspect
him
you
must
have
sharp
believe
i
have
answered
paul
i
was
watching
him
closely
as
i
walked
behind
i
knew
him
to
be
a
was
that
asked
the
young
man
once
saw
him
in
the
court
room
at
the
tombs
being
tried
for
theft
i
have
not
seen
him
since
but
i
recognized
him
at
once
i
saw
him
join
you
and
i
suspected
his
motive
at
saw
my
condition
i
saw
that
you
were
not
had
been
making
a
fool
of
myself
by
drinking
too
much
i
hope
you
drink
sir
are
wise
will
you
walk
with
me
to
my
hotel
sir
where
are
you
staying
the
albemarle
do
you
know
where
it
is
yes
answered
paul
smiling
he
felt
that
he
would
hardly
have
been
fit
for
a
telegraph
boy
if
he
had
not
known
the
location
of
a
hotel
so
well
known
have
been
spending
the
evening
with
a
few
friends
who
live
in
an
apartment
house
near
the
park
the
punch
was
remarkably
good
and
i
drank
more
than
was
good
for
me
i
suppose
you
wonder
why
i
ride
home
instead
of
walking
would
have
been
safer
at
any
had
a
headache
and
thought
i
might
walk
it
off
at
any
rate
i
should
feel
better
for
being
in
the
open
air
but
i
found
some
difficulty
in
steering
straight
as
i
dare
say
you
sir
i
observed
this
fellow
came
along
he
offered
to
accompany
me
home
and
i
never
suspected
that
he
was
a
thief
i
am
afraid
you
will
think
me
rather
no
the
appearance
might
easily
deceive
did
not
deceive
for
i
had
seen
him
before
but
will
you
pardon
me
for
saying
that
you
were
imprudent
in
carrying
around
so
large
a
sum
of
money
at
this
late
hour
are
quite
right
i
was
a
fool
and
i
am
willing
to
admit
it
was
not
long
before
paul
and
his
new
friend
reached
the
hotel
which
is
in
the
block
above
the
fifth
avenue
upstairs
with
me
said
the
young
man
you
wish
it
answered
paul
do
i
have
some
business
with
you
but
i
keep
you
paul
followed
his
new
acquaintance
into
a
handsomely
furnished
chamber
on
the
third
floor
he
involuntarily
thought
of
the
poor
tenement
house
room
in
which
he
and
old
jerry
made
their
home
and
he
wondered
whether
it
would
ever
be
his
fortune
to
be
as
well
lodged
as
the
traveler
from
missouri
not
asked
paul
hopefully
down
said
the
stranger
pointing
to
a
chair
keep
you
chapter
xxiv
a
room
at
the
albemarle
hotel
the
stranger
was
tall
and
well
formed
he
had
certainly
showed
moral
weakness
in
yielding
to
the
fascinations
of
drink
but
he
looked
like
a
smart
man
of
business
a
minute
he
said
i
will
talk
to
he
went
to
a
stationary
washtub
and
bathed
his
head
freely
he
said
after
he
had
rubbed
his
face
vigorously
with
a
towel
feel
fifty
per
cent
better
there
is
nothing
like
cold
water
after
as
well
as
outside
added
paul
with
a
smile
where
you
are
right
my
boy
evidently
your
head
is
level
you
say
you
are
a
telegraph
boy
do
you
like
it
well
for
the
like
to
follow
it
permanently
eh
sir
by
the
time
i
got
to
be
fifty
or
sixty
i
might
like
to
change
to
something
might
be
able
to
retire
on
a
would
be
a
very
small
one
judging
from
my
weekly
think
myself
unless
you
are
wedded
to
the
business
you
might
pass
your
time
more
profitably
what
do
you
think
you
would
like
enter
some
business
house
where
i
could
rise
step
by
step
as
i
deserved
it
answered
paul
with
animation
have
the
right
idea
now
let
me
tell
you
why
i
inquire
in
the
fall
my
father
will
establish
a
branch
house
here
with
myself
at
the
head
of
it
i
mind
telling
you
that
if
i
had
lost
the
money
i
have
with
me
it
is
doubtful
whether
he
would
have
trusted
me
so
far
now
thanks
to
your
prompt
assistance
i
have
been
spared
the
natural
result
of
my
folly
and
my
father
will
never
know
the
risk
i
have
run
so
you
see
that
you
have
rendered
me
an
important
am
sincerely
glad
of
it
mean
that
you
shall
be
and
on
your
account
if
i
establish
myself
here
i
shall
want
a
young
assistant
on
whose
intelligence
and
fidelity
i
can
rely
do
you
know
any
such
person
hope
you
mean
me
said
paul
eagerly
is
just
the
opening
i
have
been
looking
for
for
a
long
do
mean
you
have
you
a
father
or
mother
sir
unhappily
you
no
one
belonging
to
you
then
asked
the
young
man
with
a
look
of
sympathy
sir
i
say
that
i
have
i
live
with
an
old
man
who
is
not
related
to
me
it
is
better
than
being
he
rely
upon
you
to
contribute
to
his
support
does
but
he
need
not
he
is
a
miser
and
has
money
deposited
in
the
bowery
savings
bank
and
elsewhere
i
expect
i
think
he
has
enough
to
carry
him
through
to
the
end
of
his
he
is
a
miser
you
probably
live
very
live
in
a
poor
room
in
an
east
side
tenement
house
sir
answered
paul
are
not
contented
with
that
i
take
sir
when
i
compare
it
with
the
place
where
i
spent
this
evening
it
makes
me
mortified
and
were
at
a
party
you
said
sir
in
a
fine
brown
stone
mansion
up
it
a
little
unusual
for
a
telegraph
boy
living
in
a
tenement
house
to
be
invited
to
a
fashionable
party
sir
but
these
are
very
kind
friends
of
mine
who
overlook
my
poor
social
position
and
notice
me
as
much
as
if
i
lived
in
a
house
as
good
as
their
think
they
must
be
uncommon
people
but
i
approve
them
for
all
that
a
man
for
that
as
robert
burns
says
in
his
poem
that
is
it
makes
no
difference
whether
he
is
rich
or
poor
whether
he
lives
in
a
palace
or
a
hovel
if
there
is
good
stuff
in
him
he
deserves
would
like
to
see
the
whole
poem
said
paul
think
burns
is
do
i
but
i
must
not
forget
that
it
is
late
and
i
am
keeping
you
from
your
bed
i
have
not
told
you
my
name
is
eliot
wade
the
firm
name
is
william
o
wade
of
st
louis
we
have
a
wholesale
clothing
house
and
propose
to
establish
a
similar
one
in
new
york
now
when
this
arrangement
is
effected
how
can
i
communicate
with
you
you
will
write
to
paul
parton
no
broadway
i
shall
receive
the
letter
if
i
leave
the
telegraph
service
before
i
will
tell
them
where
to
send
any
letter
which
is
in
case
both
fail
you
will
be
sure
to
learn
our
place
from
the
advertising
columns
of
the
newspapers
in
that
case
call
and
inquire
for
you
sir
i
will
be
sure
to
do
will
be
likely
to
find
it
to
your
paul
concluding
that
there
was
nothing
more
to
be
said
rose
to
go
night
wade
he
said
consider
myself
lucky
in
having
met
can
return
the
compliment
but
i
have
not
yet
got
through
with
beg
your
pardon
said
paul
resuming
his
seat
suppose
i
would
send
you
away
without
an
immediate
acknowledgment
of
the
service
you
have
done
me
tonight
future
employment
which
you
promised
me
i
consider
a
very
valuable
will
i
hope
prove
so
but
there
is
nothing
like
a
bird
in
the
as
eliot
wade
spoke
he
produced
the
wallet
which
had
been
saved
to
him
by
the
intrepidity
and
presence
of
mind
of
paul
and
drew
therefrom
a
bank
note
which
he
tendered
to
number
that
with
my
thanks
added
he
said
paul
looked
at
the
bill
and
his
face
expressed
the
amazement
he
felt
was
a
hundred
dollar
bill
mean
to
give
me
so
much
as
this
wade
he
ejaculated
not
asked
the
young
man
with
a
smile
is
a
good
deal
too
the
other
hand
it
is
about
fifty
dollars
too
little
ten
per
cent
on
the
sum
saved
would
be
one
hundred
and
fifty
dollars
and
it
is
worth
that
however
i
will
reserve
that
for
a
future
occasion
consider
me
fifty
dollars
in
your
are
very
liberal
said
paul
earnestly
i
heartily
thank
you
you
can
imagine
that
a
hundred
dollars
is
a
large
sum
to
a
poor
telegraph
said
the
young
man
smiling
me
give
you
a
piece
of
advice
suggested
by
my
own
experience
drop
into
any
drinking
saloon
on
your
way
home
or
you
may
fall
into
the
hands
of
a
sharper
as
i
will
remember
your
caution
sir
said
paul
smiling
may
be
safer
for
you
to
ride
home
as
the
hour
is
will
do
so
sir
good
night
and
thank
seems
to
me
that
you
are
born
under
a
lucky
star
no
said
paul
to
himself
a
single
evening
i
have
received
a
sum
of
money
equal
to
half
a
wages
if
old
jerry
only
knew
it
i
should
not
dare
to
fall
asleep
in
the
same
room
with
he
took
the
green
car
whose
terminus
was
the
grand
street
ferry
and
in
less
than
half
an
hour
he
reached
the
door
of
his
humble
lodging
he
went
upstairs
and
entered
the
bed
chamber
which
contrasted
so
strongly
with
the
handsomely
furnished
hotel
room
which
he
had
just
left
he
expected
to
find
old
jerry
fast
asleep
but
he
was
mistaken
the
old
man
was
lying
on
his
poor
bed
in
a
cramped
position
his
eyes
open
moaning
piteously
is
the
matter
jerry
he
asked
approaching
the
bed
am
sick
paul
said
the
old
man
i
am
feeling
very
miserable
do
you
think
i
am
going
to
die
chapter
xxv
old
wealth
old
jerry
certainly
did
look
weak
and
miserable
his
face
seemed
thinner
and
paler
than
usual
his
thin
gray
hair
looked
quite
disordered
and
there
were
dark
rings
around
his
eyes
look
sick
answered
paul
pityingly
you
think
i
am
going
to
die
asked
the
old
man
tremulously
no
not
yet
awhile
answered
paul
in
a
cheering
voice
you
must
have
a
no
i
afford
it
said
jerry
in
alarm
charge
so
much
they
they
seem
to
think
a
man
is
made
of
you
rather
die
paul
exclaimed
impatiently
pay
for
a
attendance
what
good
will
your
money
do
you
if
you
die
you
might
ask
the
druggist
for
some
medicine
to
help
me
that
would
be
much
do
you
you
need
a
doctor
if
you
have
one
you
may
die
before
jerry
was
thoroughly
frightened
now
he
made
no
further
resistance
and
paul
summoned
a
doctor
having
an
office
on
grand
street
when
he
saw
jerry
and
felt
his
pulse
he
looked
grave
think
he
is
going
to
have
a
low
fever
he
said
it
catching
asked
hogan
nervously
for
paul
had
waked
her
up
and
asked
her
to
come
in
the
doctor
smiled
no
he
said
be
alarmed
pardon
me
for
asking
he
said
turning
to
paul
does
your
grandfather
i
suppose
he
is
your
grandfather
eat
regularly
and
sufficiently
am
afraid
not
has
lowered
his
system
i
should
judge
by
lack
of
nourishing
food
and
at
present
his
vitality
is
very
can
easily
believe
it
doctor
said
paul
will
speak
to
you
on
the
subject
later
do
you
think
he
is
going
to
have
a
fever
a
low
fever
as
i
said
the
revenge
of
outraged
nature
for
a
violation
of
her
i
going
to
die
asked
jerry
his
parchment
skin
assuming
a
greenish
hue
i
want
to
live
i
am
not
ready
to
depends
on
whether
you
follow
my
will
if
if
you
make
me
spend
too
much
money
i
am
poor
miserably
will
see
that
your
rules
are
followed
doctor
said
paul
finding
it
hard
to
hide
the
disgust
he
felt
at
this
characteristic
manifestation
of
the
old
miserly
disposition
see
you
are
a
sensible
boy
said
the
doctor
approvingly
i
had
better
speak
to
you
well
doctor
as
we
have
no
other
room
will
you
step
into
the
entry
the
doctor
followed
paul
out
you
give
your
instructions
said
the
telegraph
boy
want
to
say
that
jerry
he
is
not
my
grandfather
is
a
miser
and
has
deliberately
deprived
himself
of
the
necessaries
of
he
money
has
enough
i
am
sure
to
pay
what
is
needful
but
it
will
be
hard
to
get
him
to
spend
must
have
nourishing
food
and
stimulating
medicines
or
he
can
not
recover
his
life
is
at
he
need
a
nurse
suppose
you
attend
to
him
i
prefer
to
attend
to
my
regular
business
and
hire
some
do
so
for
the
old
man
will
require
some
weeks
at
least
to
recover
from
the
low
point
to
which
he
has
brought
think
i
can
get
hogan
to
take
care
of
him
you
may
give
her
your
first
however
paul
made
the
proposal
to
the
good
woman
see
that
you
are
paid
he
said
i
get
the
money
out
of
jerry
i
will
pay
it
paul
dear
i
want
to
take
the
little
you
have
no
more
than
enough
for
will
show
you
something
hogan
if
you
let
jerry
i
paul
produced
the
hundred
dollar
bill
and
filled
the
soul
of
hogan
with
amazement
did
you
get
it
she
asked
in
wonder
was
given
me
by
a
gentleman
whom
i
saved
from
being
robbed
of
a
good
deal
more
he
answered
see
hogan
i
am
not
so
poor
as
you
suppose
i
will
pay
you
seven
dollars
a
week
if
that
will
satisfy
you
for
your
care
of
jerry
but
i
will
try
to
get
him
to
repay
me
the
money
for
his
life
depends
on
what
we
are
able
to
do
for
the
doctor
upon
acceptance
of
the
office
of
nurse
gave
her
instructions
to
begin
with
though
late
he
directed
that
some
tea
and
oatmeal
should
be
prepared
and
administered
to
his
patient
to
reinforce
his
failing
strength
it
was
nearly
one
when
paul
threw
himself
down
on
the
lounge
with
his
clothes
on
and
fell
into
a
sound
sleep
old
jerry
did
not
immediately
improve
his
strength
was
so
far
reduced
that
it
required
time
to
rebuild
his
enfeebled
constitution
hogan
proved
a
good
nurse
indeed
in
her
younger
days
she
had
acted
in
that
capacity
and
was
not
ignorant
of
the
duties
when
paul
came
home
the
next
evening
he
found
the
nurse
waiting
to
speak
to
him
doctor
says
jerry
must
be
undressed
and
not
lay
with
his
clothes
on
she
said
old
jerry
is
so
obstinate
that
he
agree
to
you
will
feel
a
great
deal
better
to
take
off
your
clothes
said
paul
in
a
tone
of
expostulation
no
objected
jerry
in
a
terrified
tone
why
not
asked
hogan
the
doctor
knows
best
for
but
jerry
obstinately
refused
a
quare
frake
the
old
man
has
not
to
be
undressed
like
a
good
christian
observed
hogan
think
i
know
his
objection
said
paul
trouble
him
just
the
next
day
at
noon
paul
called
at
the
house
having
a
few
minutes
to
spare
hogan
met
him
with
a
smile
of
triumph
took
off
his
clothes
she
said
put
a
night
gown
on
him
and
lying
as
peaceful
as
can
he
refuse
asked
paul
in
surprise
and
a
good
reason
why
he
was
out
of
his
head
and
so
i
asked
mcquade
downstairs
to
come
up
and
help
me
and
niver
a
word
the
old
man
spoke
but
seemed
dazed
are
his
clothes
inquired
paul
eagerly
there
they
are
said
the
nurse
pointing
to
a
pile
of
wretched
garments
on
a
chair
near
the
bedside
stay
here
ten
minutes
hogan
said
paul
give
you
a
chance
to
go
to
your
you
paul
go
and
make
a
bit
of
tay
for
the
old
paul
locked
the
door
after
her
and
eagerly
took
up
the
shabby
old
suit
which
had
been
worn
for
years
by
old
jerry
he
instituted
a
careful
search
and
found
himself
richly
rewarded
in
one
pocket
he
found
a
bank
book
on
the
bowery
savings
bank
his
eyes
opened
with
amazement
when
he
found
nearly
three
thousand
dollars
set
down
to
the
old
credit
there
was
another
book
marked
the
union
dime
savings
bank
a
bank
in
the
upper
part
of
the
city
on
this
book
deposits
were
entered
to
the
amount
of
eight
hundred
and
ninety
dollars
feeling
something
stiff
behind
the
lining
of
the
coat
paul
hastily
ripped
it
open
and
found
a
certificate
of
one
hundred
shares
of
erie
then
selling
at
forty
eight
dollars
per
share
this
appeared
to
be
all
except
a
few
dollars
in
money
is
my
duty
to
take
care
of
them
reflected
paul
hogan
is
no
doubt
honest
but
others
might
enter
the
chamber
who
would
not
scruple
to
rob
the
old
man
i
will
take
care
of
them
and
deposit
them
in
a
safe
he
made
a
hasty
calculation
and
found
that
the
two
savings
bank
books
contained
deposits
amounting
to
three
thousand
eight
hundred
dollars
the
value
of
the
erie
stock
he
afterwards
ascertained
to
be
four
thousand
eight
hundred
making
in
all
eight
thousand
six
hundred
dollars
strange
that
a
man
with
so
much
money
should
be
willing
to
live
so
miserably
he
thought
he
has
shortened
his
life
by
this
at
this
point
hogan
reentered
the
room
paul
had
replaced
the
clothes
on
the
chair
and
she
did
not
observe
that
they
had
been
touched
there
anything
you
want
hogan
asked
paul
so
i
can
leave
some
money
with
might
maybe
need
to
send
mike
out
to
the
a
dollar
paul
very
kind
to
the
old
craythur
though
no
kin
to
i
expect
to
be
paid
back
some
sure
you
will
try
to
keep
life
in
the
craythur
though
little
he
enjoys
he
enjoys
it
as
much
in
his
way
as
you
or
little
enjoy
if
i
lived
like
agree
with
you
hogan
but
i
must
be
about
three
there
was
a
knock
at
door
a
woman
of
thirty
presented
herself
and
i
that
am
glad
to
see
you
barclay
said
the
hospitable
widow
set
eyes
on
you
since
you
went
over
to
live
in
jersey
i
often
get
over
here
today
i
had
to
bring
clothes
to
a
customer
and
thought
come
and
see
the
visitor
was
ellen
barclay
whom
a
strange
chance
or
was
it
providence
had
brought
unwittingly
to
the
poor
home
of
her
father
chapter
xxvi
ellen
discovery
barclay
had
only
experienced
a
feeling
of
relief
when
her
husband
failed
to
return
to
her
she
had
grown
accustomed
to
taking
care
of
herself
and
the
children
without
him
and
his
presence
seemed
likely
only
to
impose
upon
her
an
additional
burden
though
she
earned
her
living
in
a
humble
way
she
was
fairly
educated
and
could
sew
neatly
but
a
brief
trial
with
the
needle
satisfied
her
that
it
would
be
quite
impossible
to
obtain
the
comforts
of
life
for
three
persons
in
that
way
so
she
had
mastered
her
pride
and
entered
the
lists
as
a
laundress
how
are
the
children
barclay
asked
hogan
are
both
well
thank
do
you
never
hear
anything
of
their
father
face
clouded
she
answered
came
home
a
few
days
since
but
only
stayed
one
he
bring
you
any
money
then
he
borrowed
some
from
a
shame
so
it
is
in
a
great
strapping
man
like
him
to
leave
you
to
work
for
the
poor
hogan
had
never
seen
barclay
or
she
would
have
recognized
him
in
the
man
whom
she
helped
drive
away
from
his
room
and
was
utterly
ignorant
of
the
relationship
between
him
and
the
old
man
whom
she
was
nursing
know
but
wrong
said
ellen
i
believe
i
should
be
happy
if
i
thought
he
would
never
come
again
he
has
only
brought
me
trouble
and
i
dread
his
influence
upon
the
children
we
are
better
off
without
him
but
how
are
you
getting
along
yourself
hogan
no
cause
to
complain
answered
the
irish
widow
well
and
mike
and
i
pick
up
a
living
just
now
taking
care
of
a
sick
man
in
the
room
across
the
entry
an
ould
man
a
kind
of
miser
he
is
i
surmise
and
his
name
is
the
same
as
your
own
the
name
of
barclay
is
not
an
uncommon
one
but
this
statement
seemed
to
produce
a
strong
impression
on
visitor
old
man
named
barclay
she
repeated
old
should
you
think
know
but
all
dried
up
and
wrinkled
he
may
be
i
see
him
asked
the
visitor
eagerly
you
may
go
in
with
me
when
i
give
him
his
ellen
barclay
followed
hogan
into
the
opposite
room
and
looked
with
strange
interest
at
the
wan
emaciated
old
man
stretched
out
on
the
bed
brought
your
medicine
for
you
jerry
said
hogan
soothingly
exclaimed
the
younger
woman
his
name
jerry
it
is
and
what
thin
father
was
named
jeremiah
this
may
be
you
niver
seen
him
asked
hogan
in
surprise
i
did
not
know
he
was
living
till
my
recent
visit
then
he
spoke
of
his
being
a
miser
and
his
expecting
to
get
some
money
from
well
if
i
ever
heard
the
like
as
like
as
not
old
jerry
is
your
father
in
law
soon
do
you
want
to
see
your
own
son
she
asked
bending
over
and
addressing
her
patient
an
expression
of
alarm
overspread
the
old
face
let
him
come
in
keep
him
away
he
exclaimed
you
afraid
of
your
own
son
thin
asked
the
nurse
is
a
bad
man
he
tried
to
rob
me
said
the
old
man
looking
about
him
fearfully
do
believe
that
man
i
threw
the
water
on
exclaimed
hogan
in
surprise
your
appearance
barclay
is
tall
and
thick
set
and
his
hair
is
inclined
to
be
he
a
scar
on
his
right
cheek
the
same
man
i
drove
away
last
week
wid
the
water
he
was
trying
to
hurt
old
jerry
he
jerry
yes
muttered
the
old
man
a
bad
man
and
he
wanted
to
take
away
all
my
money
and
so
he
so
poor
asked
barclay
only
his
fancy
what
you
call
a
miser
what
paul
is
paul
paul
is
a
good
boy
murmured
jerry
half
unconscious
but
his
attention
arrested
by
the
familiar
name
he
is
a
good
boy
repeated
hogan
he
that
engaged
me
to
take
care
of
jerry
when
he
was
took
sick
and
he
tould
me
see
that
i
was
long
has
this
boy
been
with
him
i
remember
now
barclay
mentioned
a
telegraph
boy
he
seem
to
like
him
i
should
like
to
see
the
boy
perhaps
he
could
tell
me
something
of
the
old
man
and
help
me
to
decide
whether
he
is
really
my
father
on
what
day
did
james
call
here
hogan
told
her
was
the
day
after
he
left
me
you
say
he
got
no
money
but
he
would
if
i
come
is
strange
he
has
not
been
here
it
barclay
he
was
took
in
by
a
policeman
and
i
expect
on
the
ellen
barclay
breathed
a
sigh
of
relief
had
her
husband
been
the
man
he
should
have
been
such
news
would
have
brought
sorrow
and
distress
now
she
regarded
it
as
an
augury
of
peace
while
he
was
in
confinement
he
would
not
be
able
to
molest
her
can
i
see
this
boy
paul
she
asked
is
generally
at
home
some
part
of
the
evening
though
liable
to
come
in
at
odd
will
try
to
come
over
tomorrow
evening
if
you
think
he
will
be
at
would
be
a
good
thing
for
you
if
the
ould
man
has
money
as
paul
thinks
said
hogan
in
a
low
voice
if
my
husband
were
free
said
ellen
barclay
for
you
he
came
near
the
ould
man
but
a
dale
of
virtue
in
hot
water
added
hogan
with
a
laugh
made
a
mistake
when
he
tackled
bridget
hogan
i
can
tell
him
that
shall
have
to
go
now
hogan
i
left
the
children
without
a
cup
of
tay
just
to
make
some
for
the
ould
man
and
welcome
to
a
you
hogan
i
know
of
old
that
your
tea
is
is
that
same
if
i
say
so
thing
i
understand
said
ellen
barclay
thoughtfully
say
the
telegraph
boy
pays
you
for
taking
care
of
this
old
man
he
where
does
he
get
the
money
telegraph
boys
are
not
usually
paid
a
big
thrue
but
paul
is
such
a
favorite
he
gets
many
presents
an
honest
boy
and
my
hope
my
boy
mike
will
grow
up
just
loike
will
see
him
for
myself
tomorrow
evening
if
jerry
as
you
call
him
is
really
my
father
in
law
i
ought
to
know
it
he
seems
a
very
different
man
from
my
husband
i
see
any
resemblance
between
not
strange
neither
pat
father
was
a
little
dried
up
shrimp
of
a
man
like
ould
jerry
here
and
pat
was
five
tin
or
tin
feet
five
in
his
stockings
i
disremember
think
it
must
be
five
feet
ten
said
ellen
barclay
with
a
smile
doubt
right
but
just
come
round
tomorrow
and
see
paul
and
then
maybe
find
out
all
you
want
to
chapter
xxvii
jerry
discovers
his
loss
it
was
not
until
late
in
the
afternoon
that
jerry
regained
sufficient
command
of
his
faculties
to
observe
that
his
clothes
had
been
removed
he
uttered
a
cry
of
alarm
which
brought
hogan
into
the
room
she
found
the
old
man
struggling
to
rise
in
bed
but
without
success
so
great
was
his
weakness
try
to
get
up
jerry
she
said
soothingly
still
a
good
man
me
my
clothes
gasped
jerry
what
for
do
you
want
your
clothes
asked
hogan
supposing
that
he
wished
to
dress
the
doctor
said
you
must
have
them
taken
off
it
would
be
better
for
them
to
me
quick
gasped
the
old
man
once
more
and
what
will
you
do
with
them
mind
woman
bring
them
to
me
or
have
you
arrested
for
robbing
it
is
it
retorted
the
nurse
bridling
i
find
anything
to
stale

remain
honest
to
the
end
of
my
you
bring
them
here
get
up
the
clothes
thin
said
hogan
lifting
them
gingerly
as
though
afraid
of
contamination
i
give
two
cents
for
the
lot
of
she
little
knew
why
jerry
valued
them
and
what
a
quantity
of
wealth
had
been
concealed
in
the
soiled
garments
with
trembling
fingers
and
features
working
with
agitation
jerry
took
the
clothes
and
began
to
feel
for
his
treasures
alas
for
the
old
man
his
worst
fears
were
realized
the
bank
books
and
certificate
of
stock
had
been
removed
not
a
trace
of
them
was
to
be
found
the
poor
man
for
he
was
to
be
pitied
uttered
a
sharp
cry
of
anguish
the
clothes
dropped
from
his
nerveless
hands
and
he
fell
back
on
the
bed
as
if
stricken
with
a
mortal
wound
help
police
he
ejaculated
been
is

inquired
hogan
puzzled
of
what

hogan
indignantly

the
old
man
imploringly

hogan

belafe
an

she
asked

books
or
send

jerry
with
peevish
eagerness
at
his
work

expecting

books

are
all

honest

jerry
piteously
a
shame
to
be
such
a
question
said
hogan
you
know
paul
demane
himself
by
such
an
act
but
here
he
is
to
answer
for
she
heard
step
on
the
stairs
as
he
came
up
whistling
directly
afterwards
he
entered
the
room
the
matter
he
asked
looking
from
one
to
the
other

with
a
safe
deposit
company
for
safe
you
sure
they
are
safe
paul
much
safer
than
they
would
be
here
of
course
hogan
is
honest
but
other
persons
might
come
into
the
them
back
to
me
paul
i
want
to
see
can
if
you
insist
upon
it
jerry
but
you
are
too
sick
to
look
after
them
besides
suppose
your
son
should
come
in
some
day
he
could
rob
you
easily
and
you
would
never
see
your
property
again
shall
i
show
you
the
receipt
for
them
paul
drew
from
his
pocket
the
receipt
given
him
by
the
safe
deposit
company
and
displayed
it
to
the
old
man
me
keep
this
said
jerry
if
you
this
seemed
to
satisfy
him
and
he
clutched
the
paper
with
a
deep
sigh
of
relief
and
calmed
him
down
paul
said
hogan
it
really
true
about
the
books
was
really
true
hogan
he
has
a
good
deal
of
money
though
he
look
a
fool
he
is
to
live
as
he
does
whin
he
might
live
like
a
will
never
live
differently
when
he
dies
it
will
go
to
his
son
who
will
get
through
with
it
in
short
then
hogan
told
paul
about
the
visit
of
ellen
barclay
and
her
discovering
a
relation
in
old
jerry
wish
she
might
have
some
of
the
money
shure
she
nades
it
with
her
young
would
much
rather
she
would
have
it
than
his
son
who
is
a
ruffian
and
a
help
her
to
it
if
you
can
paul
i
will
i
want
money
myself
i
am
young
and
my
prospects
are
good
all
i
want
is
that
it
should
go
into
the
right
chapter
xxviii
jerry
finds
a
new
relation
ellen
barclay
came
over
the
next
evening
according
to
appointment
and
had
an
interview
with
paul
she
had
at
first
been
disposed
to
look
upon
him
with
suspicion
as
likely
to
divert
money
from
his
legal
heirs
but
the
interview
dispelled
all
such
ideas
the
telegraph
boy
was
so
frank
and
free
spoken
and
showed
such
an
interest
in
helping
her
that
she
was
strongly
impressed
in
his
favor
he
even
told
her
the
particulars
of
his
first
encounter
with
her
husband
and
in
what
manner
he
had
defeated
his
plan
of
gaining
possession
of
money
said
ellen
bitterly
is
a
husband
to
be
proud
he
always
been
as
bad
asked
paul
i
had
not
been
married
to
him
a
month
before
i
found
out
that
i
was
wedded
to
a
criminal
he
treated
me
brutally
and
i
only
breathed
freely
when
he
was
away
from
home
within
a
year
from
the
wedding
day
he
was
condemned
to
a
imprisonment
and
at
least
half
the
time
since
he
has
been
in
you
to
support
yourself
i
suppose
i
have
had
to
support
myself
and
the
children
even
when
he
was
a
free
man
he
did
little
or
nothing
for
the
did
you
support
yourself
asked
paul
first
i
undertook
to
maintain
myself
by
the
needle
but
the
miserable
pittance
i
received
showed
me
that
i
must
try
some
other
means
of
support
on
inquiry
i
found
that
nothing
paid
as
well
as
fine
laundry
work
for
ladies
it
was
a
trial
to
my
pride
for
i
was
well
brought
up
and
educated
to
take
in
washing
for
a
living
but
i
would
rather
do
that
than
see
my
children
suffer
so
i
stifled
my
pride
and
became
a
laundress
i
was
fortunate
in
securing
customers
and
i
have
wanted
for
nothing
neither
have
my
children
nothing
at
least
that
was
necessary
to
comfort
but
when
my
husband
came
home
lately
and
proposed
to
put
upon
me
the
additional
burden
of
his
support
i
became
hope
better
days
are
in
store
for
you
said
paul
while
my
husband
lives
and
can
find
me
out
said
ellen
barclay
sadly
you
wish
me
to
introduce
you
to
your
father
you
think
it
will
be
best
had
better
try
the
experiment
at
any
rate
he
may
die
and
if
he
does
his
money
ought
to
go
to
would
be
a
great
relief
to
me
if
my
children
would
be
provided
me
following
paul
ellen
barclay
went
into
the
chamber
occupied
by
old
jerry
the
old
man
looked
up
noticing
paul
only
you
think
i
will
get
well
paul
he
asked
jerry
if
you
receive
proper
care
and
have
nourishing
i
am
so
poor
is
a
mistake
jerry
as
you
and
i
let
any
one
know
of
the
few
dollars
i
have
let
your
son
know
he
is
the
only
one
of
whom
you
need
be
afraid
did
you
know
he
was
married
and
had
two
children
i
think
he
said
something
of
you
like
to
see
his
wife
i
know
answered
the
old
man
in
an
uncertain
voice
lady
is
your
wife
said
paul
beckoning
ellen
to
come
forward
the
old
man
regarded
her
with
an
uneasy
look
hope
you
are
not
like
james
he
said
is
a
bold
bad
man
one
knows
that
better
than
i
barclay
it
was
a
sad
day
when
i
married
have
found
him
out
too
to
my
try
to
get
my
money
asked
jerry
anxiously
but
i
should
like
to
bring
my
children
here
to
see
their
they
like
him
thank
heaven
you
may
bring
will
can
i
do
anything
for
you
except
to
keep
james
have
made
a
good
impression
on
him
said
paul
when
they
had
left
the
room
together
to
you
said
ellen
earnestly
are
a
good
boy
and
an
unselfish
one
hereafter
i
shall
trust
you
chapter
xxix
a
new
commission
number
is
unemployed
send
him
to
no
windsor
hotel
at
eleven
this
message
came
to
the
telegraph
office
at
which
paul
was
enrolled
the
superintendent
called
him
to
the
desk
is
a
call
for
you
number
he
said
comes
from
a
lady
louisa
holbrook
do
you
know
her
you
familiar
with
the
name
sir
i
never
heard
it
has
evidently
heard
of
you
it
is
now
ten
at
half
past
ten
you
may
start
for
the
windsor
hotel
if
you
arrive
there
before
eleven
you
may
wait
till
the
hour
and
then
report
at
the
room
paul
arrived
at
the
windsor
hotel
at
ten
minutes
before
the
hour
this
magnificent
hostelry
is
situated
on
fifth
avenue
and
occupies
the
entire
block
between
forty
sixth
and
forty
seventh
streets
it
is
built
of
brick
and
has
an
air
of
quiet
elegance
which
makes
it
a
favorite
with
ladies
and
others
who
like
to
be
spared
the
noise
and
bustle
which
attend
other
prominent
hotels
in
the
city
on
the
corner
just
above
stands
the
luxurious
home
of
jay
gould
the
railroad
king
a
few
blocks
above
is
the
great
catholic
cathedral
destined
one
day
to
rank
among
the
famous
churches
of
the
world
still
further
up
on
the
opposite
side
are
the
stately
houses
occupied
by
the
vanderbilt
family
these
things
however
did
not
occur
to
paul
for
he
was
too
familiar
with
the
leading
buildings
on
the
avenue
to
give
them
a
special
thought
further
than
to
reflect
men
who
occupy
these
fine
houses
were
once
poor
boys
many
of
them
i
wonder
whether
it
will
ever
be
my
fortune
to
live
as
handsomely
it
was
only
a
thought
not
seriously
entertained
paul
wanted
to
rise
but
an
active
healthy
boy
seldom
thinks
of
luxury
or
craves
it
that
comes
later
after
he
has
attained
manhood
paul
entered
the
hotel
and
going
up
to
the
office
expressed
a
wish
to
see
louisa
holbrook
you
sent
for
asked
the
clerk
you
may
go
up
at
once
to
a
bell
boy
this
boy
up
to
no
though
the
room
was
only
on
the
second
floor
paul
followed
the
bell
boy
into
the
elevator
at
the
second
landing
he
got
out
and
followed
the
hotel
attendant
to
the
door
of
a
room
fronting
on
the
avenue
the
bell
boy
knocked
and
a
voice
said
in
is
a
telegraph
boy
said
the
servant
may
come
in
and
you
can
paul
entered
the
room
a
large
and
handsome
one
and
found
himself
in
presence
of
a
lady
not
much
over
thirty
years
of
age
with
a
pleasant
face
and
manner
are
number
she
asked
suppose
you
are
surprised
that
i
should
have
sent
specially
for
you
the
lady
said
with
a
smile
wondered
how
you
came
to
hear
of
me
said
paul
is
easily
explained
i
am
a
cousin
of
face
brightened
it
was
pleasant
to
serve
any
one
connected
with
a
family
from
which
he
had
received
so
much
kindness
explains
it
he
said
the
family
have
treated
me
very
assure
you
that
you
stand
very
high
in
their
estimation
said
holbrook
smiling
once
more
young
cousin
jennie
was
here
yesterday
and
on
learning
the
nature
of
my
business
urged
me
to
send
for
am
very
much
obliged
to
miss
jennie
said
paul
with
genuine
pleasure
for
though
too
young
to
be
in
love
he
liked
jennie
cunningham
better
than
any
girl
he
had
ever
seen
is
time
i
explained
the
errand
on
which
i
propose
to
employ
you
said
holbrook
must
know
then
that
i
have
an
old
aunt
living
at
the
village
of
rockville
in
connecticut
she
is
advanced
in
years
and
possessed
of
large
wealth
she
has
a
comfortable
home
and
prefers
to
keep
house
rather
than
live
with
any
of
her
relatives
she
does
not
live
alone
however
she
employs
a
housekeeper
a
mercer
whose
son
a
young
man
of
twenty
five
also
finds
employment
on
the
place
this
woman
i
have
reason
to
think
is
an
artful
person
who
knowing
my
aunt
to
be
wealthy
has
ingratiated
herself
with
her
and
is
evidently
scheming
for
her
property
or
at
any
rate
a
handsome
share
of
it
if
it
were
any
person
who
had
a
rightful
claim
i
think
i
may
say
for
myself
and
my
cousins
that
we
would
not
interfere
in
the
matter
as
we
are
all
moderately
rich
but
we
decidedly
object
to
our
falling
into
the
hands
of
an
artful
adventurer
like
this
housekeeper
you
are
wondering
no
doubt
how
all
this
concerns
you
i
will
come
to
that
cunningham
tells
me
you
are
a
sharp
shrewd
boy
and
i
propose
to
send
you
down
as
a
confidential
messenger
to
look
about
you
judge
of
the
progress
the
housekeeper
has
made
in
her
designs
and
if
you
see
anything
wrong
apprise
us
or
if
there
is
any
chance
open
my
eyes
to
the
real
character
of
the
persons
she
has
paul
listened
to
statement
with
attention
some
difficulties
however
presented
themselves
to
his
mind
i
am
in
the
house
he
said
shall
find
it
difficult
to
carry
out
your
will
be
in
the
house
i
shall
give
you
a
letter
to
my
aunt
saying
that
you
are
a
boy
in
whom
i
am
interested
and
that
i
am
anxious
to
have
you
pass
a
few
weeks
in
the
country
can
you
drive
a
horse
is
nothing
i
like
better
answered
paul
promptly
you
take
care
of
a
horse
did
you
acquire
this
knowledge
in
the
city
far
from
where
i
live
is
a
stable
kept
by
a
man
whom
i
know
well
i
have
been
in
there
a
good
deal
and
helped
him
when
he
needed
it
sometimes
i
would
drive
out
for
holbrook
nodded
approvingly
am
glad
to
hear
it
she
said
aunt
is
fond
of
riding
and
has
a
horse
and
carriage
she
can
make
you
useful
in
that
way
and
also
as
her
secretary
if
she
needs
any
one
to
write
for
her
or
read
to
her
i
suppose
you
are
equal
to
such
duties
i
am
not
to
go
as
a
telegraph
boy
i
presume
have
you
another
suit
but
i
am
afraid
it
is
not
good
i
will
fit
you
out
i
may
as
well
write
a
letter
first
to
my
aunt
and
then
i
will
see
about
proper
clothes
for
you
i
think
i
will
go
to
brokaw
brothers
can
you
go
with
me
at
once
paul
answered
in
the
affirmative
is
your
name
very
good
name
that
will
do
quite
holbrook
sat
down
at
the
desk
and
wrote
the
following
letter
dear
aunt
am
taking
a
liberty
in
sending
you
a
boy
in
whom
i
am
interested
with
the
request
that
you
will
give
him
a
home
for
a
few
weeks
if
he
should
be
contented
i
know
you
have
a
large
house
and
plenty
of
room
i
think
a
young
companion
will
help
enliven
the
house
paul
parton
that
is
his
name
will
be
happy
to
be
of
service
to
you
in
any
way
he
understands
horses
and
will
drive
you
out
any
time
harness
and
unharness
read
to
you
or
write
for
you
should
you
require
it
i
ask
you
to
receive
him
as
a
guest
for
my
sake
but
to
make
him
useful
hope
my
dear
aunt
you
are
in
comfortable
health
and
in
a
condition
to
enjoy
life
notwithstanding
your
advanced
years
affectionate
niece
said
holbrook
after
reading
the
letter
to
paul
think
this
will
secure
you
an
entrance
into
my
house
and
should
it
be
read
by
the
housekeeper
as
is
likely
to
be
the
case
it
will
tell
her
nothing
now
we
will
go
out
and
see
about
getting
you
a
supply
of
chapter
xxx
reception
at
rockville
paul
found
himself
unable
to
start
for
rockville
in
the
afternoon
he
was
obliged
to
make
arrangements
at
home
for
an
indefinite
absence
and
procure
from
the
savings
bank
a
supply
of
money
for
current
expenses
which
he
left
in
the
hands
of
hogan
his
outfit
was
provided
by
holbrook
who
made
it
as
ample
as
if
paul
were
the
son
of
a
well
to
do
family
instead
of
a
telegraph
boy
dependent
upon
his
own
exertions
for
a
scanty
living
in
a
shabby
tenement
house
when
his
new
patroness
parted
from
him
she
put
a
pocketbook
into
his
hands
is
not
intended
for
remuneration
she
said
i
shall
pay
the
telegraph
company
their
usual
charges
but
i
wish
you
to
have
money
to
use
as
you
may
require
you
said
paul
are
very
i
am
only
considerate
and
you
any
special
directions
to
give
holbrook
beyond
what
i
have
already
given
i
must
trust
greatly
to
your
own
good
judgment
and
discretion
i
am
sure
i
can
do
so
with
confidence
after
the
good
report
cunningham
has
made
of
you
i
will
try
to
deserve
your
may
write
to
me
from
time
to
time
when
you
have
anything
to
paul
promised
to
do
so
and
at
nine
took
a
train
at
the
grand
central
depot
for
rockville
fairly
seated
in
the
cars
he
opened
the
pocketbook
given
him
by
holbrook
it
contained
three
five
dollar
bills
and
five
dollars
more
in
small
notes
holbrook
is
very
liberal
he
reflected
complacently
will
be
a
pleasure
to
be
in
her
service
i
am
fortunate
in
finding
such
good
paul
was
fortunate
but
his
good
fortune
was
deserved
he
always
tried
to
do
his
duty
was
always
courteous
and
obliging
and
not
afraid
to
work
such
boys
generally
find
friends
if
any
of
my
readers
think
they
are
badly
treated
by
their
employers
and
are
poorly
provided
with
friends
let
them
consider
whether
they
have
taken
pains
to
deserve
them
paul
had
never
traveled
and
two
ride
on
the
cars
from
new
york
to
rockville
on
a
pleasant
sunny
morning
interested
him
very
much
he
knew
very
little
of
the
country
having
spent
most
of
his
time
in
the
lower
part
of
the
city
he
began
to
think
the
world
was
more
beautiful
than
he
imagined
finally
the
cars
came
to
a
stop
the
conductor
called
out
and
paul
with
curious
anticipation
stepped
from
the
cars
upon
the
platform
there
was
the
usual
crowd
around
the
depot
on
the
platform
stood
a
man
with
a
whip
in
his
hand
evidently
a
driver
for
the
hotel
or
any
part
of
the
village
he
called
out
paul
stepped
up
to
him
and
inquired
you
tell
me
how
far
from
here
granville
lives
widder
granville
queried
the
driver
suppose
so
she
is
an
old
so
well
she
lives
about
a
mile
away
on
the
plainfield
you
take
me
there
as
you
over
and
above
hefty
i
guess
the
horses
can
manage
it
added
the
driver
humorously
hop
on
be
starting
paul
got
on
the
front
seat
with
the
driver
feeling
disposed
to
a
social
chat
with
that
personage
there
was
but
one
other
passenger
a
lady
who
was
bound
for
the
hotel
you
going
to
visit
the
widder
asked
the
knight
of
the
whip
am
expecting
to
stay
at
her
house
a
little
suppose
you
know
her
i
have
never
seen
her
i
bring
a
letter
from
her
niece
in
new
york
louisa
heard
tell
of
her
she
was
down
here
a
week
last
summer
i
guess
she
and
the
housekeeper
hitch
mercer
is
the
housekeeper
i
believe
said
paul
call
her
the
housekeeper
i
call
her
the
boss
said
the
driver
got
the
old
lady
under
her
thumb
if
all
accounts
are
she
agreeable
amos
the
driver
emitted
a
short
laugh
till
you
see
her
he
said
significantly
you
think
granville
stands
in
dread
of
her
asked
paul
rather
anxiously
he
was
beginning
to
think
his
task
might
be
a
hard
one
the
old
lady
is
easy
that
is
all
if
she
ever
got
roused
turn
out
to
have
a
will
of
her
own
or
greatly
mistaken
bless
your
soul
mercer
dare
to
go
too
far
for
she
wants
the
old
lady
to
leave
her
a
good
slice
of
her
property
but
she
gets
round
her
in
an
underhand
way
for
instance
if
her
son
wants
to
go
off
anywhere
and
it
convenient
for
him
to
drive
the
old
lady
out
mercer
persuades
her
that
she
looking
well
or
that
the
wind
is
cold
and
raw
and
better
stay
at
home
i
be
surprised
if
get
the
old
lady
to
make
a
will
in
her
wonder
what
sort
of
a
reception
the
housekeeper
will
give
me
said
paul
thoughtfully
likely
she
will
not
be
over
glad
to
see
you
especially
when
she
knows
a
friend
of
holbrook
that
lady
saw
through
the
little
schemes
and
did
what
she
could
to
put
a
spoke
in
her
wheel
why
she
hates
all
i
can
do
is
to
hope
for
the
yer
to
stay
long
asked
amos
curiously
depends
on
whether
the
housekeeper
will
let
me
from
what
you
tell
find
it
dreadful
so
but
going
to
offer
to
drive
out
granville
and
willing
to
take
care
of
the
horse
or
horses
if
she
wants
me
will
like
that
for
lazy
and
will
be
glad
to
get
rid
of
the
suppose
frost
is
the
the
one
i
sort
of
a
fellow
is
he
enough
for
those
who
like
him
answered
amos
dryly
he
resemble
his
mother
a
chip
of
the
old
block
but
not
half
so
smart
his
mother
thinks
him
an
angel
and
what
she
wants
the
old
property
for
is
not
so
much
for
herself
as
for
her
think
i
find
him
a
pleasant
companion
then
know
you
i
hope
i
shall
like
a
good
old
lady
and
awful
rich
the
only
weak
thing
about
her
is
her
trusting
the
should
think
she
would
prefer
to
have
some
relative
with
get
any
to
stay
with
her
till
she
discharges
mercer
the
housekeeper
makes
herself
as
disagreeable
as
possible
to
any
relation
because
afraid
they
will
get
an
influence
over
the
old
mind
and
interfere
with
she
may
think
the
same
of
as
not
you
can
tell
better
in
a
few
days
but
the
house
the
big
white
one
on
a
little
hill
to
the
is
a
very
nice
yes
a
good
house
why
it
be
the
old
got
plenty
of
you
any
idea
how
much
a
hundred
thousand
dollars
i
heard
squire
taylor
say
once
squire
taylor
is
her
lawyer
and
likely
to
wonder
the
housekeeper
has
designs
upon
so
i
mind
if
the
old
lady
would
leave
me
a
slice
you
might
put
in
a
good
word
for
me
amos
drake
when
you
get
think
of
it
answered
paul
with
a
smile
owe
you
something
for
all
the
information
given
all
right
you
seem
a
good
sort
of
chap
and
amos
drew
up
in
front
of
the
house
and
reined
in
the
horses
while
paul
descended
from
the
carriage
much
is
the
fare
asked
number
near
enough
said
paul
handing
him
a
quarter
a
gentleman
said
amos
have
a
cigar
when
i
get
back
to
the
paul
walked
up
the
path
to
the
front
door
of
the
mansion
and
rang
the
bell
in
about
a
minute
the
door
opened
and
he
found
himself
confronting
a
tall
grim
looking
woman
with
thin
face
and
figure
and
iron
gray
hair
are
you
and
what
is
your
business
she
demanded
in
a
chilly
tone
paul
had
no
doubt
in
his
own
mind
that
it
was
the
housekeeper
name
is
paul
parton
from
new
york
and
i
have
a
letter
for
can
give
me
the

but
i
would
prefer
to
give
it
to
granville
are
you
one
of
her
relations
but
i
come
from
holbrook
her
said
the
housekeeper
grimly
i
think
you
can
see
granville
got
a
headache
and
be
chapter
xxxi
a
defeat
for
the
housekeeper
the
housekeeper
held
the
door
half
way
open
and
evidently
meant
to
prevent
paul
from
entering
if
he
had
been
less
determined
or
more
easily
abashed
he
would
have
given
up
his
purpose
but
number
had
a
will
of
his
own
accept
a
dismissal
from
you
madam
he
said
eying
mercer
with
a
steady
glance
demand
to
see
toity
who
are
you
like
to
know
demanded
the
housekeeper
amazed
and
exasperated
visitor
to
granville
answered
paul
i
suppose

a
you
dare
to
call
me
a
servant

impudent
boy
answered
mercer
raising
her
voice
are

then
asked
paul
calmly
am

the
housekeeper
have
you
to
i
suppose
and
granville
is
your
employer
by
what
right
do
you
dare
to
send
away
her
visitors
mercer
was
quite
unused
to
being
defied
so
boldly
and
she
could
hardly
express
her
indignation
i
never
heard
of
such
impudence
she
ejaculated
in
her
anger
she
would
have
closed
the
door
but
just
at
that
moment
a
voice
was
heard
from
the
floor
above
the
voice
of
granville
who
had
been
attracted
by
the
loud
tones
is
all
this
mercer
she
asked
in
a
tone
of
authority
a
boy
who
wants
to
force
his
way
in

mercer
in

sulky
tone

question

said

once
said
the
old
lady
in
an
imperative
tone
did
you
not
admit
him
at
once
know
answered
the
housekeeper
confused
beg
your
pardon
said
paul
told
you
this
and
you
said
granville
had
a
headache
and
would
not
see
do
you
mean
by
this
misrepresentation
mercer
demanded
the
old
lady
sternly
offered
to
take
the
letter
up
to
you
said
mercer
a
little
alarmed
at
the
evident
anger
of
her
mistress
granville
reads
the
letter
she
will
understand
why
i
preferred
to
hand
it
to
her
did
you
say
i

a
headache
why
do
you
presume
to
send
away
my
visitors

pleasant
sitting
room

politely

put

her
glasses
and
read

paul
smiling

on
the
whole
i

said
the
old
lady
thoughtfully
am
afraid
mercer
might
object
to
am
the
mistress
of
the
house
mercer
is
only
the
housekeeper
said
the
old
lady
with
an
unwonted
assumption
of
dignity
ring
the
bell
paul
did
so
presently
the
housekeeper
entered
in
answer
to
the
summons
she
looked
askance
at
paul
mercer
said
her
mistress
will
prepare
a
room
for
this
young
gentleman
he
will
remain
here
for
the
mercer
looked
disagreeably
surprised
you
had
better
read
this
letter
from
my
niece
holbrook
as
it
will
save
the
housekeeper
read
the
letter
and
her
thin
lips
tightened
with
displeasure
is
no
need
of
your
getting
a
boy
to
drive
you
around
she
said
son
is
perfectly
able
to
do
son
is
very
apt
to
be
engaged
when
i
want
to
drive
out
returned
the
old
lady
dryly
will
see
that
it
happen
again
said
the
housekeeper
anxious
to
keep
paul
out
of
the
house
is
no
occasion
for
that
mind
i
blame
your
son
paul
here
will
have
nothing
else
to
do
and
can
drive
me
as
well
as
not
besides
he
will
read
to
me
and
spare
my
would
be
willing
to
read
to
granville
smiled
think
reading
aloud
is
one
of
your
accomplishments
she
said
voice
is
not
exactly
this
was
certainly
true
for
frost
mercer
had
a
voice
deep
and
croaking
like
a
am
sorry
you
are
so
prejudiced
against
my
poor
boy
said
mercer
mortified
and
displeased
are
a
foolish
woman
mercer
i
am
only
going
to
make
it
easier
for
frost
and
give
this
young
gentleman
something
to
do
paul
you
may
go
with
mercer
and
take
possession
of
your
room
go
where
you
please
till
half
past
twelve
our
dinner
hour
after
dinner
i
may
take
a
better
get
your
life
insured
then
muttered
mercer
to
be
trusted
with
your
horse
very
lively
or
skittish
asked
paul
answered
granville
is
very
gentle
and
i
think
there
is
any
need
of
insuring
your
life
ride
out
with
you
said
the
housekeeper
spitefully
you
will
think
better
of
me
after
a
while
mercer
said
paul
good
naturedly
the
housekeeper
closed
her
lips
firmly
and
shook
her
head
made
one
enemy
clear
said
paul
to
himself
two
for
the
son
likely
to
be
my
mercer
led
the
way
to
a
small
room
on
the
next
floor
can
go
in
there
she
said
ungraciously
you
said
paul
it
occurred
to
him
to
wonder
why
so
small
a
room
should
be
assigned
him
while
there
seemed
to
be
plenty
of
larger
ones
in
the
arrangement
of
the
room
however
there
was
nothing
to
be
desired
everything
was
neat
and
comfortable
to
paul
accustomed
to
a
shabby
tenement
house
it
seemed
luxurious
and
he
was
disposed
to
enjoy
it
for
the
time
be
it
long
or
short
chapter
xxxii
frost
mercer
is
contrary
mercer
the
housekeeper
was
seriously
annoyed
by
the
appearance
of
paul
upon
the
scene
for
years
she
and
her
son
had
had
charge
of
affairs
and
they
had
taken
care
to
turn
the
charge
to
profitable
account
the
wages
which
each
received
formed
only
a
part
of
this
advantage
they
bought
everything
for
the
house
and
levied
tribute
from
every
tradesman
as
a
compensation
for
turning
the
trade
in
his
direction
the
result
was
that
granville
without
being
aware
of
it
paid
a
larger
price
than
any
one
else
for
what
articles
she
purchased
the
storekeepers
and
others
compensating
themselves
in
this
way
for
the
percentage
they
had
to
pay
the
housekeeper
and
her
son
it
is
for
this
reason
that
mercer
never
cared
to
have
any
visitor
in
the
house
she
feared
her
dishonesty
might
be
found
out
she
was
especially
afraid
of
any
one
sent
by
holbrook
who
during
her
stay
had
been
bold
enough
to
interfere
with
the
housekeeper
when
she
had
ushered
paul
into
his
chamber
she
went
out
to
the
barn
where
she
found
her
son
not
at
work
but
sitting
on
an
old
rocking
chair
which
he
had
carried
out
for
his
convenience
smoking
mother
up
he
asked
on
entrance
have
got
a
visitor
answered
his
mother
abruptly
is
it
the
holbrook
woman
queried
frost
taking
his
pipe
from
his
mouth
but
some
one
she
woman
or
child
a
boy
about
sixteen
he
on
earth
should
she
send
a
boy
for
asked
frost
in
surprise
make
mischief
i
can
a
boy
do
read
the
letter
she
sends
him
to
take
your
exclaimed
frost
in
some
alarm
she
hints
that
he
can
drive
out
the
old
lady
read
to
her
and
make
himself
generally
will
make
it
lighter
for
me
said
frost
who
was
lazy
he
does
the
but
you
see
what
a
chance
he
will
have
to
work
himself
into
the
confidence
of
the
old
woman
sort
of
a
boy
does
he
seem
to
be
only
seen
him
five
minutes
but
found
out
that
he
is
impudent
when
i
want
to
let
him
in
he
actually
defied
me
asked
by
what
right
i
sent
away
he
is
inclined
to
make
trouble
is
he
i
give
him
a
thrashing
do
think
i
am
not
a
match
for
a
boy
of
sixteen
not
that
but
we
must
not
be
imprudent
better
get
rid
of
him
by
underhand
as
what
know
yet
i
will
consider
meantime
i
thought
i
would
come
out
and
put
you
on
your
right
mother
i
guess
we
can
checkmate
the
young
meddler
is
he
in
the
house
put
him
in
the
small
to
mine
right
look
him
over
at
dinner
in
this
however
frost
counted
without
his
host
granville
was
accustomed
to
have
her
meals
brought
up
to
her
own
room
today
she
expressed
the
wish
that
paul
should
dine
with
her
this
displeased
the
housekeeper
suppose
frost
and
i
are
not
good
enough
company
for
the
young
man
she
said
sulkily
good
mercer
you
are
much
mistaken
said
granville
soothingly
thought
he
would
be
company
for
me
besides
it
will
give
me
a
chance
to
ask
him
some
questions
about
well
said
the
housekeeper
but
she
look
satisfied
do
you
think
frost
she
said
as
she
went
downstairs
paul
his
name
is
to
dine
with
the
old
woman
upstairs
i
suppose
he
is
too
good
to
eat
with
know
as
i
care
much
mother
i
want
his
i
for
the
matter
of
that
but
putting
this
young
popinjay
over
our
heads
be
getting
thick
together
and
the
boy
will
be
pulling
our
noses
out
of
he
does
pull
his
out
of
joint
muttered
frost
your
time
frost
put
our
heads
together
and
see
if
we
send
him
after
dinner
granville
expressed
a
desire
as
it
was
a
fine
day
to
go
out
for
a
drive
shall
be
very
happy
to
drive
you
said
paul
cheerfully
are
sure
you
can
drive
asked
the
old
lady
anxiously
should
smile
paul
was
about
to
reply
when
it
occurred
to
him
that
this
form
of
expression
did
not
sound
exactly
proper
am
used
to
driving
he
said
instead
about
two
you
may
go
out
to
the
barn
and
ask
frost
to
harness
do
that
when
he
went
out
to
the
barn
he
found
frost
mercer
sitting
at
his
ease
engaged
at
his
favorite
business
of
smoking
a
pipe
suppose
you
are
frost
he
said
with
a
smile
am
mercer
answered
frost
in
a
forbidding
tone
beg
your
pardon
i
will
call
you
mercer
if
you
prefer
it
i
am
paul
know
as
that
concerns
me
said
frost
staring
at
paul
in
an
unfriendly
manner
is
just
as
well
you
should
know
my
name
as
i
am
living
in
the
house
said
paul
independently
granville
wishes
me
to
drive
her
out
if
you
will
show
me
what
carriage
she
uses
and
so
forth
i
will
harness
this
was
on
the
whole
satisfactory
to
frost
as
he
would
not
have
the
trouble
of
harnessing
the
carriage
he
said
the
harness
you
can
find
the
horses
if
you
use
your
you
you
are
very
obliging
said
paul
with
a
little
touch
of
sarcasm
old
lady
seem
to
value
her
neck
observed
frost
makes
you
think
so
letting
you
drive
it
i
think
i
shall
bring
her
back
know
about
that
a
city
boy
you
chance
have
you
had
to
learn
about
horses
know
a
little
about
i
wash
my
hands
of
it
if
the
team
is
upset
granville
will
have
herself
to
blame
for
think
you
need
to
worry
said
paul
promise
to
bring
her
back
he
set
to
work
to
harness
the
horses
frost
surveyed
him
with
critical
eyes
but
he
could
see
no
evidence
of
ignorance
on
part
he
did
his
work
quickly
and
skillfully
and
then
opening
wide
the
barn
doors
led
the
horses
out
then
he
jumped
into
the
carriage
and
was
about
to
drive
to
the
house
back
and
shut
the
barn
doors
called
out
frost
from
his
rocking
chair
paul
turned
and
looked
back
think
it
will
do
you
any
harm
to
do
that
yourself
he
said
you
can
spare
the
time
from
that
demanded
frost
angrily
think
it
will
be
necessary
to
repeat
it
said
paul
coolly
heard
of
yer
sass
boy
said
frost
wrathfully
paul
did
not
deign
to
answer
him
he
saw
that
frost
did
not
intend
to
be
pleased
with
anything
he
did
and
that
there
was
no
use
in
trying
to
conciliate
hate
that
boy
reflected
frost
following
paul
with
a
venomous
expression
mother
is
perfectly
right
a
dangerous
visitor
we
must
get
rid
of
him
one
way
or
paul
drove
around
to
the
front
of
the
house
and
found
granville
ready
at
the
door
with
the
housekeeper
at
her
side
do
hope
you
meet
with
an
accident
said
mercer
with
an
air
of
deep
solicitude
is
ready
to
drive
you
it
will
be
you
my
good
mercer
but
paul
tells
me
he
understands
mind
if
she
broke
her
neck
muttered
the
housekeeper
following
the
carriage
with
her
eyes
i
only
knew
it
was
all
right
now
in
her
chapter
xxxiii
a
startling
discovery
paul
proved
a
satisfactory
driver
and
the
old
fears
were
soon
dissipated
drive
better
than
frost
mercer
she
said
in
a
tone
of
satisfaction
am
glad
to
hear
you
say
so
granville
said
paul
well
pleased
nearly
upset
me
one
day
i
think
he
is
generally
intemperate
but
i
suspect
he
had
been
drinking
something
that
seem
to
like
me
paul
ventured
to
say
makes
you
think
so
hereupon
paul
related
his
reception
when
he
went
to
the
barn
to
harness
the
horses
granville
listened
thoughtfully
should
not
have
acted
so
she
said
presume
he
like
the
idea
of
being
he
been
with
you
a
long
time
and
his
mother
have
been
in
my
service
for
a
long
time
i
think
mercer
is
of
a
jealous
disposition
she
never
wishes
me
to
have
any
one
here
but
she
is
very
faithful
and
wonder
if
that
is
the
case
thought
paul
the
housekeeper
did
not
seem
to
him
like
one
who
would
be
unselfishly
devoted
to
the
service
of
any
one
several
days
passed
every
day
granville
rode
out
sometimes
in
the
forenoon
sometimes
in
the
afternoon
and
the
effect
was
perceptible
in
her
improved
health
and
spirits
is
fortunate
for
me
that
you
came
here
she
said
one
day
you
came
i
rode
out
only
once
or
twice
a
week
it
seems
to
do
me
great
good
to
drive
every
did
you
not
go
out
every
day
granville
asked
paul
did
not
seem
to
like
the
trouble
of
going
out
with
me
she
answered
often
sent
word
that
he
was
at
work
and
could
not
go
paul
wondered
whether
he
was
engaged
smoking
in
the
barn
in
his
guess
he
came
near
the
truth
added
the
old
lady
did
not
like
to
ride
out
with
him
as
well
as
with
paul
thanked
her
for
the
compliment
like
to
talk
with
you
but
frost
was
not
very
social
and
we
had
very
little
one
afternoon
granville
asked
paul
to
drive
round
to
the
grocery
store
she
wished
to
get
a
supply
of
a
particular
kind
of
cheese
which
she
had
neglected
to
order
through
the
housekeeper
it
so
happened
that
there
were
several
customers
ahead
of
her
and
she
had
to
wait
her
turn
these
were
being
supplied
with
various
articles
and
the
old
lady
could
not
help
overhearing
what
passed
between
them
and
the
storekeeper
one
thing
in
especial
attracted
her
attention
the
prices
that
were
charged
they
were
in
every
instance
below
those
charged
on
the
bills
handed
in
to
her
by
mercer
granville
made
careful
note
of
these
prices
and
on
the
way
home
broached
the
matter
to
paul
does
it
mean
paul
do
you
think
she
asked
wits
had
been
sharpened
by
his
city
experience
and
he
rapidly
penetrated
the
secret
always
buy
through
mercer
do
you
not
he
asked
but
what
of
that
i
answer
it
may
prejudice
you
against
the
housekeeper
and
perhaps
it
is
only
right
that
you
should
tell
mercer
buy
wherever
she
pleases
i
leave
the
choice
of
the
place
to
there
another
grocer
in
the
village
there
are
i
think
she
charges
this
grocer
a
commission
for
carrying
your
trade
to
him
and
he
makes
up
for
it
by
charging
you
a
higher
that
often
done
asked
granville
surprised
i
feel
sure
of
it
i
remember
one
evening
in
the
city
listening
to
a
conversation
between
two
coachmen
employed
in
private
families
they
were
boasting
of
the
amount
of
their
commissions
obtained
from
blacksmiths
dealers
in
hay
and
oats
and
so
that
is
dishonest
said
the
old
lady
indignantly
look
upon
it
in
that
way
answered
paul
do
you
agree
with
them
asked
the
old
lady
half
suspiciously
i
answered
paul
promptly
think
they
ought
to
be
satisfied
with
their
are
right
as
for
mercer
and
frost
they
are
paid
more
than
most
employers
would
pay
for
i
am
rich
and
thank
heaven
not
condemn
them
without
feeling
certain
said
paul
may
be
wrong
in
their
feel
satisfied
until
i
have
ferreted
the
matter
out
said
granville
she
was
very
good
and
liberal
but
any
attempt
at
imposition
made
her
very
angry
will
you
find
out
will
the
old
lady
relapsed
into
silence
and
was
evidently
busy
with
her
thoughts
when
she
reached
home
she
called
services
into
requisition
she
said
the
drawer
of
my
bureau
the
upper
drawer
and
take
out
a
file
of
bills
you
will
find
in
the
left
hand
paul
did
so
are
talbot
was
the
grocer
whose
store
she
had
left
we
will
compare
the
bills
with
the
prices
i
heard
being
charged
to
the
customers
who
were
being
waited
on
in
the
this
she
did
with
help
the
result
was
that
she
found
herself
charged
two
cents
a
pound
extra
on
sugar
five
cents
on
butter
three
cents
on
cheese
five
cents
each
on
tea
and
coffee
and
so
on
besides
she
found
that
excessive
quantities
of
each
had
been
bought
more
than
three
persons
could
possibly
have
consumed
what
became
of
the
surplus
unless
it
was
thrown
away
she
could
not
possibly
divine
of
course
the
commission
increased
with
increased
sales
the
real
explanation
however
was
that
mercer
had
a
widowed
sister
living
in
the
next
town
she
often
called
on
mercer
and
never
went
away
without
a
liberal
supply
of
groceries
taken
from
the
private
stores
of
granville
this
the
old
lady
did
not
learn
till
afterwards
if
mercer
had
known
in
what
way
her
mistress
and
paul
were
engaged
she
would
have
quaked
with
apprehension
but
of
this
she
had
no
suspicions
the
next
afternoon
granville
drove
over
once
more
to
store
and
asked
for
a
private
interview
with
him
said
the
unsuspecting
grocer
obsequiously
is
it
talbot
asked
the
old
lady
coming
straight
to
the
point
you
charge
me
higher
prices
than
you
do
to
your
other
customers
makes
you
think
i
do
stammered
the
grocer
tell
you
yesterday
i
was
present
when
some
of
your
customers
were
buying
butter
sugar
and
other
articles
i
noted
the
prices
and
then
went
home
and
examined
my
bills
i
find
you
charge
me
from
two
to
five
cents
a
pound
more
than
to
others
tell
me
frankly
why
this
is
and
i
may
overlook
make
any
more
profit
out
of
you
than
out
of
them
said
the
grocer
how
is
this
you
charge
me
more
extra
charge
does
not
go
into
my
suspected
as
much
into
whose
then
i
must
tell
you
it
is
it
is
the
only
condition
on
which
she
gives
me
your
you
it
is
right
that
i
should
you
speak
to
mercer
about
this
when
you
get
home
asked
paul
as
they
were
driving
homeward
immediately
i
want
to
observe
her
a
little
more
it
is
a
shock
to
find
that
one
to
whom
i
have
been
kind
for
so
many
years
has
deceived
me
so
meanwhile
mercer
who
was
becoming
more
and
more
jealous
of
paul
was
arranging
a
scheme
to
injure
him
with
granville
chapter
xxxiv
a
plot
against
paul
the
housekeeper
and
her
son
had
seen
with
increasing
alarm
the
growing
attachment
of
granville
for
paul
got
to
be
done
frost
she
said
decidedly
boy
is
setting
the
old
woman
against
so
mother
she
never
wants
me
to
go
with
her
now
i
might
as
well
be
out
of
the
house
so
far
as
any
notice
of
me
mighty
cool
to
me
too
frost
i
suspected
how
it
would
be
when
that
boy
came
into
the
house
the
artfulest
young
one
i
ever
two
of
us
ought
to
be
a
match
for
him
grumbled
frost
give
him
a
if
you
say
would
do
no
good
only
take
his
part
and
as
likely
as
not
send
you
packing
no
we
must
adopt
a
different
shall
it
be
smarter
than
i
am
mother
do
whatever
you
think
thought
of
a
plan
frost
said
mercer
and
she
proceeded
to
communicate
it
to
him
do
said
the
son
in
a
tone
of
satisfaction
got
to
give
her
a
bad
opinion
of
her
favorite
and
then
get
rid
of
this
conversation
took
place
in
room
one
evening
this
room
adjoined
and
it
so
happened
that
in
the
upper
part
of
the
room
there
was
a
round
hole
in
the
partition
made
probably
for
the
entrance
of
a
funnel
which
rendered
it
easy
for
conversation
to
be
heard
in
the
adjoining
room
paul
had
been
spending
the
evening
in
room
but
was
dismissed
earlier
than
usual
and
had
retired
to
his
own
bed
room
so
it
chanced
that
he
heard
the
details
of
the
plot
against
him
it
did
not
surprise
him
much
for
he
was
quite
aware
of
the
hostility
towards
him
he
had
been
on
the
point
of
lighting
his
lamp
but
decided
not
to
do
so
and
noiselessly
prepared
for
bed
he
felt
that
forewarned
was
forearmed
and
he
determined
to
tell
granville
what
he
had
heard
this
he
did
the
next
morning
the
old
lady
listened
attentively
did
not
believe
mercer
capable
of
such
wickedness
she
said
all
the
kindness
i
have
heaped
upon
her
too
suppose
she
is
jealous
of
me
suggested
paul
my
part
i
wish
her
no
harm
i
would
not
have
told
you
except
to
defend
myself
in
advance
of
any
charges
she
may
make
against
have
done
right
paul
said
the
old
lady
kindly
mercer
selfishly
wishes
to
monopolize
all
my
favors
whatever
i
may
do
for
you
would
not
have
interfered
with
her
if
she
had
behaved
properly
now
she
must
take
the
consequences
of
her
early
in
the
afternoon
granville
directed
paul
to
bring
the
carriage
round
to
the
door
when
they
had
driven
a
quarter
of
a
mile
she
said
may
drive
me
to
coleraine
this
was
an
adjoining
town
about
four
miles
away
reaching
the
town
the
old
lady
directed
paul
to
drive
her
to
the
office
of
her
lawyer
finding
him
in
she
said
may
take
the
horse
to
the
stable
and
come
back
in
an
hour
i
have
some
business
to
attend
said
paul
obediently
he
returned
in
an
hour
but
had
to
wait
half
an
hour
longer
then
the
old
lady
came
out
and
seemed
unusually
cheerful
she
said
have
been
making
my
thought
it
might
have
been
made
already
said
our
hero
it
was
but
i
have
made
a
new
paul
did
not
feel
called
upon
to
reply
have
not
forgotten
you
continued
granville
kindly
you
very
much
said
paul
gratefully
pretend
to
be
sorry
but
i
hope
it
will
be
a
long
time
before
i
reap
any
benefit
from
am
sure
of
that
paul
said
the
old
lady
are
not
selfish
and
self
seeking
like
mercer
and
frost
they
were
handsomely
remembered
in
my
former
will
but
i
had
not
found
them
out
when
they
reached
the
house
mercer
herself
opened
the
door
there
was
a
look
of
blended
mystery
and
triumph
on
her
face
as
she
admitted
them
i
speak
with
you
a
minute
in
private
granville
she
said
with
a
significant
glance
in
direction
mercer
paul
you
may
go
out
and
put
up
the
coming
thought
paul
what
is
it
mercer
asked
the
old
lady
as
she
led
the
way
into
her
own
chamber
about
that
boy
paul
i
know
you
think
him
an
not
quite
that
mercer
smiled
granville
any
rate
you
think
a
great
deal
of
i
never
liked
him
for
my
part
continued
the
housekeeper
spitefully
always
distrusted
him
i
thought
him
a
snake
in
the
mercer
rather
a
heavy
indictment
of
the
poor
can
prove
all
i
say
said
the
housekeeper
thought
you
were
wrong
in
trusting
has
he
done
come
to
the
see
this
said
mercer
producing
a
breast
pin
set
with
pearls
it
is
do
you
think
i
found
it
you
tell
the
bureau
drawer
while
you
were
did
you
happen
to
be
examining
his
drawer
asked
the
old
lady
sharply
from
things
i
have
noticed
i
suspected
he
meant
to
rob
you
i
expect
to
find
that
i
confess
but
i
did
think
i
should
find
something
this
favorite
of
yours
is
nothing
but
a
may
call
him
mercer
it
is
only
fair
to
hear
what
he
has
to
say
for
mercer
needed
no
second
bidding
she
hurried
to
the
stables
and
found
paul
occupied
in
unharnessing
the
horses
she
said
finish
unharnessing
the
horses
granville
wants
to
see
this
young
frost
obeyed
with
unwonted
alacrity
and
paul
quietly
followed
the
housekeeper
into
the
house
he
was
not
particularly
alarmed
for
he
had
already
put
a
spoke
in
the
wheel
though
she
was
quite
unaware
of
it
granville
an
errand
for
me
to
do
he
asked
suppressing
a
smile
find
out
what
she
wants
of
you
returned
the
housekeeper
tossing
her
head
man
your
course
is
about
run
it
asked
paul
innocently
he
followed
mercer
into
chamber
the
old
lady
was
sitting
in
her
arm
chair
by
the
window
brought
him
said
mercer
you
can
find
out
for
yourself
what
a
viper
he
said
the
old
lady
mildly
mercer
tells
me
she
found
this
breast
pin
in
your
bureau
drawer
do
you
know
anything
about
it
answered
paul
not
betraying
the
slightest

answered
the
old
lady
this
breast

which
you

during

i
distinctly
remember
leaving
in
my
own
bureau

when
i
left
the
house
this
mercer
was
panic
stricken
she
turned
to
leave
the
room
quite
overwhelmed
but
granville
called
her
back
mercer
she
said
have
something
to
say
to
chapter
xxxv
paul
returns
to
new
york
the
housekeeper
turned
at
the
bidding
of
her
mistress
and
gazed
at
her
in
apprehension
waiting
for
her
to
speak
wish
to
speak
to
you
about
another
matter
mercer
i
have
made
a
discovery
which
reflects
seriously
upon
is
it
asked
the
housekeeper
nervously
it
is
that
for
a
long
time
i
know
how
long
i
have
been
paying
talbot
higher
prices
for
groceries
and
other
articles
than
he
charges
any
one
know
it
answered
mercer
you
mean
to
say
that
he
imposed
upon
you
just
what
i
do
say
answered
the
housekeeper
gaining
boldness
give
him
a
piece
of
my
granville
eyed
her
gravely
is
too
late
to
impose
upon
me
mercer
she
said
know
why
he
charged
me
extra
wanted
to
make
money
out
of
you
i
or
some
one
else
it
is
useless
to
misrepresent
i
know
that
this
extra
sum
went
into
your
pocket
wait
seeing
the
housekeeper
about
to
speak
learned
his
usual
prices
and
with
help
i
went
over
the
bills
for
the
last
three
months
and
have
discovered
how
much
i
have
been
doings
no
doubt
said
mercer
bitterly
referring
to
paul
are
mistaken
though
if
it
were
true
it
would
not
help
you
any
i
myself
discovered
the
overcharge
and
simply
employed
paul
to
look
over
the
bills
with
lied
said
the
housekeeper
desperately
she
could
not
have
expected
this
denial
would
benefit
her
but
she
was
reluctant
to
confess
her
guilt
believe
he
tells
the
truth
returned
her
mistress
have
you
to
say
say
anything
it
do
any
good
said
mercer
sullenly
so
infatuated
with
that
boy
that
you
do
me
me
remind
you
said
the
old
lady
with
dignity
paul
has
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
the
matter
i
think
well
of
him
it
is
true
and
am
even
attached
to
him
but
your
wrong
doing
commenced
before
he
came
and
your
senseless
jealousy
has
betrayed
you
into
a
disgraceful
plot
against
him
of
course
you
and
your
son
can
not
remain
in
my
the
housekeeper
had
not
anticipated
this
it
was
a
terrible
thought
that
she
and
frost
must
go
forth
from
the
home
that
had
known
them
so
long
me
granville
she
pleaded
in
great
agitation
will
give
up
all
the
money
i
have
made
out
of
my
purchases
on
your
account
i
will
indeed
and
more
too
if
you
insist
upon
it
only
let
me
stay
think
of
the
years
i
have
been
in
your
service
should
have
thought
of
that
mercer
you
should
have
thought
of
my
kindness
to
you
and
your
son
and
rejected
the
temptation
to
rob
me
as
you
have
will
give
it
all
back
i
told
you
i
would
said
the
housekeeper
with
feverish
lips
too
late
i
have
lost
confidence
in
you
you
are
not
the
woman
i
supposed
for
a
small
gain
you
have
thrown
away
a
great
prospect
you
and
your
son
were
down
in
my
will
for
a
handsome
sum
this
day
i
have
made
a
new
given
your
property
to
that
boy
i
suppose
said
the
housekeeper
in
passionate
anger
decline
to
tell
you
in
what
way
i
have
disposed
of
my
money
returned
the
old
lady
with
dignity
now
for
the
future
you
and
your
son
will
leave
me
at
the
end
of
this
will
leave
this
very
day
exclaimed
mercer
angrily
can
do
as
you
please
but
i
should
not
advise
you
to
do
so
you
did
not
wait
for
my
conclusion
you
will
leave
at
the
end
of
the
week
but
if
you
remain
till
then
you
will
not
go
empty
handed
i
will
not
only
let
you
keep
what
you
have
wrongfully
taken
but
in
acknowledgment
of
past
services
i
will
pay
you
and
frost
three
wages
in
advance
to
keep
you
until
you
find
new
will
stay
said
the
housekeeper
sullenly
will
be
you
keep
this
boy
with
you
she
could
not
help
asking
jealously
not
long
he
will
wish
to
go
back
to
the
this
assurance
relieved
mercer
and
almost
reconciled
her
to
her
own
departure
at
the
end
of
the
week
however
granville
closed
her
house
for
a
time
employing
a
neighboring
farmer
to
take
care
of
the
land
and
went
to
new
york
under
escort
to
make
her
niece
a
visit
when
she
parted
with
paul
she
placed
in
his
hands
a
check
for
one
hundred
dollars
is
for
yourself
she
said
and
see
me
every
week
you
will
not
lose
your
when
paul
returned
to
his
old
home
he
found
a
great
change
in
old
jerry
he
was
better
in
health
though
still
feeble
but
his
mind
seemed
more
at
rest
hogan
was
sick
and
his
daughter
in
law
ellen
barclay
was
in
attendance
upon
him
to
increased
surprise
the
two
children
jimmy
and
mary
were
in
the
room
and
seemed
on
very
good
terms
with
their
grandfather
expect
to
see
me
here
paul
said
barclay
but
i
am
glad
to
find
you
here
said
the
telegraph
boy
cordially
hogan
has
been
sick
with
a
fever
and
it
was
necessary
that
some
one
should
take
her
place
so
i
it
must
be
inconvenient
for
you
to
come
over
from
jersey
city
every
have
left
jersey
city
and
occupy
an
apartment
does
old
jerry
barclay
look
upon
you
are
very
good
friends
i
am
more
used
to
nursing
than
hogan
and
i
make
him
thought
he
might
be
prejudiced
against
you
on
account
of
your
was
at
first
but
we
have
talked
freely
about
him
and
he
finds
that
i
too
am
in
fear
of
him
so
we
have
made
common
cause
and
he
trusts
am
very
glad
of
it
said
paul
earnestly
is
as
it
should
be
i
think
jerry
can
live
long
and
you
and
your
children
ought
to
get
the
benefit
of
his
are
a
good
boy
number
i
misjudged
you
at
first
i
thought
you
were
plotting
for
the
old
money
and
so
i
am
sure
did
my
think
so
now
i
know
you
is
strange
said
paul
smiling
out
in
the
country
where
i
have
spent
the
last
few
weeks
i
was
suspected
of
plotting
for
the
property
of
an
old
lady
by
whom
i
was
employed
the
housekeeper
was
very
much
exercised
in
mind
and
tried
to
fasten
a
charge
of
theft
upon
hope
she
was
not
granville
knew
me
wish
the
lady
you
mention
would
leave
you
something
trouble
myself
with
such
thoughts
i
have
good
friends
and
i
am
sure
that
i
shall
prosper
if
i
keep
my
one
deserves
success
you
barclay
i
value
your
good
this
conversation
took
place
in
the
entry
just
then
the
feeble
voice
of
jerry
was
heard
calling
his
daughter
in
law
hastened
to
the
bedside
of
the
old
man
and
attended
to
his
wants
paul
followed
her
into
the
room
five
minutes
later
a
heavy
step
was
heard
on
the
stairs
and
the
door
was
opened
all
turned
to
see
who
was
the
visitor
the
old
man
uttered
a
cry
of
alarm
his
eyes
were
on
the
door
and
he
was
the
first
to
recognize
the
intruder
he
cried
right
father

james
barclay
gruffly
glad

welcome
me

in
such
a
nervous
condition
that
paul
was
glad
to
obtain
even
such
a
brief
respite
as
this
he
drew
from
his
pocket
a
two
dollar
bill
and
handed
it
to
james
barclay
who
immediately
got
up
and
walked
towards

a
frown

hogan
who
had
entered
during
the
conversation
the
woman
who
threw
hot
water
upon
me
you
old
jade
retorted
james
his
face
black
with
anger
a
great
mind
to
wring
your
neck
for
he
made
a
step
forward
which
alarmed
paul
lest
he
might
proceed
to
carry
out
his
threat
laughed
barclay
kid
is
going
to
defend
a
fine
boy
he
is
said
hogan
you
trouble
yourself
number
a
match
for
the
ould
brute
any
hogan
standing
with
her
arms
akimbo
looked
thoroughly
fearless
and
undaunted
she
was
a
powerful
woman
and
though
james
barclay
was
of
course
her
superior
in
physical
force
he
would
not
have
found
her
an
unresisting
victim
he
go
away
was
heard
in
a
wailing
voice
from
the
bed
is
going
directly
answered
ellen
barclay
in
a
soothing
voice
james
brow
contracted
sowing
mischief
between
my
father
and
me
my
lady
he
said
just
what
i
expected
but
you
forget
one
thing
the
rightful
heir
of
that
old
ninny
on
the
bed
there
and
if
anybody
tries
to
cut
me
out
find
got
something
to
say
about
a
pretty
way
to
talk
of
your
father
as
an
ould
ninny
said
hogan
indignantly
you
mind
none
of
your
business
i
suppose
looking
for
a
slice
of
the
property
not
james
barclay
an
honest
woman
and
can
earn
my
own
glad
to
hear
it
but
not
so
sure
of
the
telegraph
boy
been
living
on
the
old
man
all
his
life
and
he
means
to
be
provided
for
when
he
know
what
your
father
would
have
done
without
him
said
hogan
worked
for
old
jerry
ever
since
he
was
six
years
old
when
his
own
flesh
and
blood
deserted
him
it
so
jerry
paul
is
a
good
boy
responded
jerry
feebly
no
doubt
an
angel
sneered
james
barclay
say
number
as
you
seem
to
have
my
money
just
mention
that
i
shall
want
ten
dollars
have
no
money
of
your
barclay
and
i
shall
not
be
able
to
advance
you
the
money
got
to
come
from
some
quarter
said
barclay
he
gives
it
to
me
or
you
i
care
as
long
as
i
have
ought
to
earn
your
own
living
big
and
strong
enough
said
hogan
with
spirit
you
a
fine
woman
said
james
barclay
mockingly
barclay
would
only
be
obliging
enough
to
leave
me
a
widower
i
might
take
you
for
my
second
leave
me
to
support
you
retorted
hogan
you
for
nothing
rather
be
a
widow
all
the
days
of
my
life
than
to
marry
james
barclay
laughed
yet
some
people
think
me
good
looking
he
said
they
must
be
blind
however
it
the
way
you
look
the
way
you
behave
that
sets
me
aginst
a
pity
for
your
sake
my
sweet
hogan
i
might
be
tempted
to
turn
over
a
new
more
than
one
new
leaf
need
to
turn
over
paul
laughed
at
this
retort
and
even
the
victim
of
sarcasm
was
forced
to
laugh
too
then
greatly
to
the
relief
of
all
present
the
unwelcome
visitor
left
the
house
i
pity
you
barclay
said
hogan
sympathetically
such
a
husband
as
that
what
made
you
marry
him
i
thought
him
a
different
man
but
the
delusion
last
long
before
three
months
had
passed
i
found
that
he
had
married
me
for
a
few
hundred
dollars
left
me
by
my
aunt
when
he
had
spent
them
he
treated
me
with
the
way
wid
the
men
hope
not
with
all
of
them
hogan
said
paul
smiling
paul
i
mean
you
i
mind
marrying
you
if
you
were
old
had
one
offer
said
paul
my
blushes
chapter
xxxvii
james
scheme
james
barclay
presented
himself
the
next
day
true
to
his
notice
and
demanded
ten
dollars
paul
was
not
at
home
and
the
only
persons
to
whom
he
could
appeal
were
his
father
his
wife
and
hogan
any
money
james
answered
barclay
seventy
five
cents
and
that
i
must
spend
for
medicines
for
your
father
and
something
for
his
did
that
money
come
from
inquired
barclay
as
i
thought
got
my
money
and
doles
it
out
to
you
a
little
at
a
says
it
is
his
own
a
likely
story
when
could
a
common
telegraph
boy
get
so
much
money
a
common
telegraph
boy
he
is
a
very
smart
uncommon
telegraph
boy
then
if
you
prefer
it
by
jove
i
think
he
is
that
myself
it
every
boy
of
his
age
who
could
so
pull
the
wool
over
an
old
eyes
as
he
is
a
very
good
boy
said
barclay
who
had
learned
to
appreciate
paul
though
she
was
at
first
inclined
to
do
him
injustice
he
is
of
the
kind
retorted
her
husband
you
were
not
blind
you
would
see
that
he
has
got
hold
of
my
property
and
means
to
keep
the
share
of
it
for
himself
when
will
he
be
home
till
six
only
three
i
think
i
can
it
was
fortunate
that
he
did
not
see
the
look
of
satisfaction
upon
his
face
it
would
have
incensed
him
for
his
temper
as
the
reader
has
had
occasion
to
learn
was
not
of
the
best
here
he
said
after
a
reflection
me
the
seventy
five
cents
make
it
do
till
i
get
a
chance
to
see
this
telegraph
james
i
really
spare
it
i
need
it
to
buy
some
supper
and
medicines
for
your
i
need
it
to
buy
some
supper
for
myself
returned
her
husband
roughly
plenty
more
money
where
that
came
james
how
can
you
be
so
hard
and
selfish
and
selfish
just
because
i
want
to
starve
i
be
glad
to
read
my
obituary
in
the
paper
some
fine
morning
barclay
eh
she
read
much
good
of
you
said
hogan
be
hard
on
me
hogan

promised
to
marry
you
if
ellen
here
ever
gives
me
the
thin
i
hope

you
though
i
wish
she
had
a
better
husband
as
she
well
desarves
poor
dear
come
around
again
tonight
was
james
parting
assurance
you
come
if
got
any
other
business
to
attind
to
we
can
spare
but
james
barclay
did
come
and
was
fortunate
enough
to
find
paul
at
home
there
his
good
fortune
ended
however
paul
positively
denied
having
any
money
belonging
to
old
jerry
and
as
positively
refused
to
advance
james
any
money
of
his
own
you
expect
me
to
believe
that
story
number
demanded
the
visitor
with
lowering
look
care
whether
you
believe
it
or
not
but
true
all
the
james
barclay
was
silent
for
a
moment
and
then
considerably
to
surprise
went
out
without
further
disturbance
the
fact
was
that
a
new
scheme
had
occurred
to
him
he
was
thoroughly
convinced
that
paul
had
his
property
in
his
possession
if
he
could
get
the
telegraph
boy
into
his
power
kidnap
him
in
fact
he
would
be
able
to
extort
from
him
the
money
or
learn
where
it
lay
concealed
evening
he
said
shall
meet
again
but
james
plans
were
frustrated
in
a
tragic
way
on
leaving
the
house
he
met
an
old
acquaintance
who
proposed
to
him
to
join
forces
in
a
burglary
that
evening
barclay
was
at
the
end
of
his
resources
and
readily
agreed
he
had
so
often
got
off
scot
free
that
he
was
disposed
to
underestimate
the
danger
incurred
it
was
destined
to
be
the
last
crime
in
which
he
was
to
take
part
he
was
surprised
at
his
work
by
a
private
watchman
and
fatally
shot
dying
almost
instantly
when
paul
read
in
the
morning
papers
the
account
of
tragic
end
he
was
shocked
though
he
could
not
mourn
for
one
whose
life
had
been
a
curse
to
himself
and
all
connected
with
him
to
old
jerry
his
death
was
a
positive
relief
as
may
readily
be
imagined
chapter
xxxviii
conclusion
three
months
passed
during
which
paul
faithfully
attended
to
his
duties
as
a
telegraph
boy
he
was
held
in
high
consideration
by
the
superintendent
who
was
very
naturally
influenced
by
the
fact
that
paul
had
made
so
many
influential
friends
but
the
time
was
coming
when
he
would
no
longer
be
number
one
night
he
received
a
note
signed
eliot
wade
asking
him
to
call
in
the
evening
at
the
albemarle
hotel
he
presented
himself
promptly
and
was
cordially
greeted
by
the
young
man
from
louis
to
whom
he
had
rendered
an
important
service
am
glad
to
see
you
paul
said
the
young
man
i
am
glad
you
have
not
forgotten
me
was
no
danger
of
that
well
paul
i
have
come
to
new
york
for
the
purpose
i
mentioned
to
you
that
of
starting
a
branch
establishment
you
secured
a
store
sir
i
shall
be
located
at
is
a
fine
hope
it
will
prove
so
and
now
paul
are
you
engaged
in
business
i
mean
he
added
smiling
am
still
a
telegraph
boy
number
you
resign
your
position
and
enter
my
service
sir
in
a
year
or
two
i
shall
be
too
old
for
a
telegraph
boy
and
it
will
be
well
to
learn
some
business
i
suppose
you
will
not
want
me
for
some
the
contrary
i
need
you
at
once
there
will
be
a
good
deal
of
work
attendant
upon
getting
started
and
i
shall
find
plenty
of
work
for
shall
be
glad
to
begin
next
monday
sir
i
want
to
leave
the
telegraph
office
without
well
let
it
be
so
will
twelve
dollars
a
week
satisfy
you
at
first
you
really
mean
it
wade
asked
paul
in
surprise
i
earn
so
that
to
me
said
the
young
man
smiling
intend
to
have
you
earn
that
sum
and
more
next
paul
expressed
his
gratitude
and
immediately
gave
notice
at
the
telegraph
office
that
he
was
about
to
leave
expected
it
number
said
the
superintendent
what
powerful
friends
you
had
secured
i
am
sorry
to
lose
you
but
i
wish
you
success
and
prosperity
in
your
new
paul
thought
best
to
make
some
change
in
his
residence
he
had
already
secured
a
separate
room
for
himself
in
the
old
tenement
house
sickness
making
it
necessary
now
he
persuaded
old
jerry
to
pay
the
rent
of
a
modest
flat
up
town
to
which
he
and
james
family
removed
paul
hired
a
room
not
far
away
the
location
was
not
far
from
central
park
and
the
better
air
and
diet
very
much
improved
the
health
of
the
old
man
who
has
become
less
miserly
and
finds
comfort
in
the
society
of
his
family
paul
makes
frequent
calls
on
cunningham
who
receives
him
as
a
valued
friend
whether
partiality
for
jennie
cunningham
will
lead
to
anything
when
he
gets
older
i
must
leave
the
reader
to
conjecture
it
must
be
remembered
that
he
is
no
longer
a
telegraph
boy
but
a
rising
young
business
man
granville
retains
her
partiality
for
him
and
makes
no
secret
of
the
fact
that
she
has
remembered
paul
in
her
will
paul
would
be
surprised
if
he
knew
the
legacy
he
is
to
receive
but
he
wisely
keeps
the
matter
out
of
his
thoughts
and
earnestly
hopes
the
old
lady
may
live
many
years
yet
it
is
rather
a
curious
circumstance
that
mark
sterling
is
employed
as
a
boy
in
the
same
establishment
where
paul
is
a
clerk
when
mark
applied
for
the
place
he
was
not
aware
that
the
telegraph
boy
upon
whom
he
had
looked
down
so
scornfully
was
also
employed
there
when
he
found
it
out
and
that
paul
was
above
him
he
was
tempted
to
resign
but
the
place
was
a
good
one
and
he
decided
to
wait
awhile
he
feared
paul
would
retaliate
upon
him
but
he
was
soon
undeceived
the
ex
telegraph
boy
treated
him
so
cordially
and
showed
such
an
obliging
spirit
that
mark
was
won
in
spite
of
himself
and
the
two
became
friends
i
have
no
doubt
that
the
improved
social
condition
of
paul
and
the
prospect
that
granville
would
leave
him
a
legacy
influenced
mark
at
any
rate
he
has
now
become
a
friend
of
number
the
telegraph
boys
who
used
to
serve
in
the
same
office
with
paul
are
proud
to
point
him
out
as
a
graduate
of
the
office
and
his
rise
in
life
encourages
them
to
hope
for
future
advancement
have
had
many
boys

the
office
