office

the
librarian
of
congress
at
washington
queen
mary
tennyson
has
achieved
a
great
reputation
as
a
lyric
poet
he
urges
now
a
higher
claim
in
the
sunset
of
a
not
inglorious
life
when
we
should
have
expected
his
lute
to
warble
with
waning
melodies
and
less
impassioned
strains
he
lays
it
aside
as
too
feeble
for
his
maturer
inspirations
and
as
though
renewed
with
the
fire
of
a
second
youth
he
draws
to
his
bosom
a
nobler
instrument
and
awakes
the
echoes
of
sublimer
chords
he
has
grown
weary
of
the
lyric
multa
cum
laude
coronam
and
with
some
confidence
claims
the
dramatic
bays
nay
he
even
invites
a
comparison
with
shakspere
true
to
the
temper
of
the
times
his
prestige
follows
him
in
so
hazardous
a
competition
the
accustomed
wreaths
are
showered
upon
him
with
unreflecting
haste
and
the
facile
representatives
of
the
most
incapable
of
critics
public
opinion
have
already
offered
him
that
homage
as
a
dramatist
which
had
already
been
too
lavishly
offered
to
his
idyllic
muse
it
is
an
ungrateful
task
to
go
against
the
popular
current
and
it
is
an
ungracious
one
to
object
to
crowns
which
the
multitude
have
decreed
but
there
is
no
help
for
it
unless
we
would
stoop
to
that
criticism
of
prestige
which
is
so
characteristic
of
the
age
and
would
follow
in
the
wake
of
the
literary
rabble
criticising
the
works
by
the
author
instead
of
the
author
by
his
works
we
may
as
well
say
at
once
that
we
have
never
felt
it
in
our
power
to
acknowledge
the
poetical
supremacy
of
the
english
it
has
always
appeared
to
us
that
there
is
in
his
poetry
a
lack
of
inspiration
to
borrow
a
too
familiar
but
expressive
metaphor
the
coin
is
highly
burnished
glitters
brightly
and
has
the
current
stamp
but
one
misses
the
ring
of
the
genuine
metal
he
sits
patiently
on
the
tripod
dealing
forth
phrases
as
musical
as
numbers
and
as
polished
as
those
of
a
greek
sophist
spiced
with
a
refined
humor
which
has
a
special
charm
of
its
own
but
his
soul
does
not
kindle
at
the
sacred
fire
we
miss
the
divine
frenzy
a
passionateness
of
love
of
the
beautiful
does
not
appear
to
be
the
quickening
inspiration
of
his
creations
all
alike
show
signs
of
extreme
care
and
preparation
we
do
not
forget
the
counsel
of
horace
but
that
only
refers
to
a
distant
revision
of
creations
which
an
unchecked
genius
may
have
produced
under
the
divine
influence
whereas
poetry
bears
evidence
of
infinite
toil
in
production
all
his
thoughts
ideas
and
images
down
to
words
and
phrases
are
too
evidently
instead
of
the
happy
inspirations
of
genius
the
labored
workmanship
of
a
polished
refined
and
fastidious
mind
they
something
resemble
the
of
a
who
has
succeeded
in
conveying
to
his
dress
an
appearance
of
such
consummate
simplicity
and
unexceptionable
taste
that
every
one
notices
the
result
of
hours
before
the
mirror
his
diction
is
pure
and
polished
his
phrases
simple
and
nervous
and
the
english
language
owes
him
much
for
what
he
has
done
towards
neutralizing
the
injury
inflicted
on
it
by
the
gaudy
phraseology
of
the
poets
and
the
antithetical
sesquipedalianism
of
such
prose
writers
as
johnson
and
gibbon
and
for
preserving
it
in
its
pure
and
nervous
simplicity
but
his
soul
is
dull
to
the
poetic
meanings
of
nature
his
natural
scenery
is
rather
descriptive
than
a
creation
much
as
artists
of
whom
there
are
not
a
few
who
reproduce
with
consummate
skill
of
imitation
objects
in
detail
and
bestow
infinite
care
upon
color
shade
perspective
grouping
and
all
the
other
technical
details
of
a
picture
whilst
comparatively
indifferent
to
the
subject
which
ought
to
be
the
poetic
meaning
of
creations
of
genius
and
what
are
they
but
only
fruitful
manifestations
of
the
love
of
the
beautiful
and
echoes
of
its
creative
word
not
the
mere
manipulations
of
an
artificer
descriptions
of
nature
owe
their
vividness
to
the
brilliance
of
and
a
certain
refined
delicacy
of
touch
sometimes
even
and
indeed
very
often
to
a
certain
quaint
humor
which
is
inconsistent
with
the
highest
art
it
is
not
a
passionate
love
which
regards
the
object
beloved
from
a
ridiculous
point
of
view
as
when
he
describes
the
willows
living
adown
the
banks
of
a
streamlet
as
pollards
down
the
the
sensations
provoked
by
his
poetry
resemble
those
of
one
who
has
sauntered
through
a
museum
of
precious
stones
of
rare
workmanship
and
purest
water
our
æsthetic
taste
has
been
pleased
by
the
glitter
and
the
color
and
the
brilliance
but
our
mind
and
heart
have
not
been
deeply
moved
his
poems
are
ablaze
with
detached
thoughts
of
lofty
meaning
and
of
a
multitude
of
others
whose
meaning
is
not
obvious
all
alike
expressed
in
vivid
imagery
in
the
purest
phraseology
and
in
rare
melody
of
rhythm
but
they
are
confused
and
cabalistic
he
seems
to
be
always
laboring
to
be
incomprehensible
he
calls
it
riddling
of
the
and
he
succeeds
the
problem
of
the
sphinx
the
emblematic
warning
sent
by
the
scythians
to
their
persian
invader
the
mute
counsel
sent
by
the
samian
to
the
corinthian
tyrant
a
delphic
oracle
all
were
clear
and
easy
by
comparison
with
lyrics
alike
in
detached
passages
and
in
entire
poems
none
of
woman
born
can
fathom
the
meaning
of
the
of
the
this
defect
alone
is
fatal
to
poetry
so
keenly
did
spenser
feel
it
that
although
the
meaning
of
his
allegory
faerie
is
obvious
enough
to
any
ordinary
intelligence
he
is
careful
to
explain
it
in
full
in
a
letter
dedicated
to
sir
walter
raleigh
tennyson
on
the
contrary
involves
himself
in
the
thickest
mystery
he
can
contrive
and
expects
his
worshippers
to
take
it
for
inspiration
take
the
following
for
example
from
coming
of
rain
and
sun
a
rainbow
in
the
sky
a
young
man
will
be
wiser
an
old
wit
may
wander
he
die
rain
and
sun
a
rainbow
on
the
lea
and
truth
is
this
to
me
and
that
to
thee
and
truth
or
clothed
or
naked
let
it
be
sun
and
rain
and
the
free
blossom
blows
sun
rain
and
sun
and
where
is
he
who
knows
from
the
great
deep
to
the
great
deep
he
these
are
no
doubt
triplets
as
he
himself
calls
them
the
riddling
of
fools
even
the
wanderings
from
the
night
of
distraught
brain
are
light
itself
by
the
side
of
them
we
may
well
echo
his
invocation
of
rain
and
sun
and
where
is
he
who
knows
whatever
inspiration
may
be
evident
here
it
is
not
that
of
the
beautiful
and
yet
even
this
has
snatches
of
meaning
which
many
passages
we
might
adduce
have
not
as
the
following
from
and
ye
not
then
the
riddling
of
the
bards
confusion
and
illusion
and
relation
elusion
and
occasion
and
evasion
it
is
almost
a
pity
that
the
bard
did
not
complete
his
while
he
was
about
it
another
couplet
diffusion
and
ablution
and
abrasion
ablution
expectation
botheration
would
have
rendered
still
more
impenetrable
the
bardic
mystery
there
is
no
resemblance
in
this
studied
concealment
of
meaning
if
meaning
there
be
to
that
madness
of
the
bards
when
god
makes
music
through
them
of
which
he
sings
it
is
more
like
the
melodious
confusion
of
the
æolian
harp
even
if
the
poet
have
a
definite
meaning
in
his
own
mind
if
he
so
express
it
that
i
can
not
even
guess
it
to
me
it
is
nonsense
and
nonsense
however
melodious
although
it
may
enchant
my
sense
can
not
move
my
heart
here
and
there
however
our
poet
sings
snatches
of
real
poetry
as
sir
answer
to
his
king
in
coming
of
heard
the
water
lapping
on
the
craig
and
the
long
ripple
washing
in
the
upon
the
whole
tennyson
excels
in
a
certain
underlying
vein
of
exquisitely
refined
humor
and
when
his
subject
admits
of
it
he
is
unrivalled
his
is
the
poetry
of
humor
we
would
name
as
examples
northern
and
the
satirical
poem
hall
perhaps
the
most
vigorous
of
all
his
productions
and
of
his
longer
poems
it
is
for
this
reason
we
think
he
is
more
likely
to
excel
as
a
dramatist
in
comedy
than
in
tragedy
if
our
readers
would
estimate
the
full
force
of
our
remarks
we
would
invite
them
to
read
the
works
of
any
of
the
principal
of
our
earlier
lyrical
poets
as
for
example
collins
we
name
him
because
he
too
excels
in
that
melody
of
versification
for
which
tennyson
is
so
distinguished
at
times
as
in
his
on
evening
he
surpasses
the
laureate
in
that
respect
although
for
sustained
and
unfailing
rhythmical
melody
the
latter
bears
away
the
palm
from
him
and
perhaps
from
every
other
rival
but
in
profound
sympathy
with
nature
in
the
fidelity
of
his
creations
in
the
echoes
of
the
beautiful
which
he
provokes
within
the
soul
of
the
reader
the
must
yield
to
the
demy
of
magdalen
like
shakspere
he
peopled
inanimate
nature
with
a
fairy
world
and
amongst
elves
and
genii
and
other
dainty
spirits
he
abandoned
himself
to
that
power
of
impersonation
which
is
almost
an
attribute
of
a
true
poet
our
space
does
not
admit
of
illustrative
quotations
but
we
would
refer
the
reader
inclined
to
institute
the
comparison
suggested
to
the
elegy
over
fidele
in
the
play
of
and
to
his
poetry
has
beauties
of
its
own
peculiar
kind
of
so
remarkable
and
striking
a
description
that
we
might
have
hesitated
to
take
any
exceptions
whatsoever
to
his
poetical
genius
but
his
new
poem
his
first
effort
in
dramatic
poetry
seems
to
us
to
set
all
doubt
at
rest
it
convinces
us
that
for
whatever
reasons
of
the
highest
flights
of
poetic
inspiration
tennyson
is
incapable
we
are
convinced
that
he
lacks
that
which
constitutes
a
great
poet
however
beautiful
his
poetry
we
feel
that
it
wants
something
which
however
keenly
we
may
be
sensible
of
it
it
is
not
easy
either
to
analyze
or
explain
for
what
is
the
inspiration
of
poetry
but
the
echoes
of
the
beautiful
within
the
soul
of
man
the
universe
of
things
is
the
visible
word
of
god
it
is
his
essential
beauty
projected
by
an
energy
of
creative
love
the
quickening
spirit
opening
his
wings
over
chaos
into
an
objective
existence
on
which
its
generator
looked
with
complacency
as
good
and
which
he
generated
in
order
that
his
creature
whom
he
had
made
in
his
own
image
might
with
himself
rejoice
in
its
contemplation
he
did
not
at
first
endow
him
with
the
power
of
beholding
himself
to
face
but
only
his
reflex
we
have
the
right
to
believe
that
whilst
in
union
with
his
maker
he
read
at
a
glance
the
meaning
of
the
word
he
felt
instantaneously
the
beauty
of
the
image
his
nature
into
which
no
discord
had
as
yet
been
introduced
uncondemned
to
the
judgment
of
painful
toil
did
not
acquire
charity
and
knowledge
by
long
and
laborious
processes
disciplinary
and
ratiocinative
but
by
intuition
incapable
as
yet
of
the
beatific
vision
he
comprehended
the
whole
of
the
divine
beauty
as
revealed
in
creation
and
the
comprehension
itself
was
a
transport
of
love
he
saw
and
knew
and
loved
and
the
three
were
one
simultaneous
energy
of
the
sonship
of
his
nature
but
as
now
greatest
of
these
was
it
was
the
result
and
sum
and
end
of
the
sight
and
knowledge
it
was
the
feeling
they
inevitably
and
unremittingly
occasioned
to
speak
as
we
can
only
speak
in
our
actual
condition
it
was
as
those
thuds
of
loving
admiration
with
which
our
hearts
throb
when
we
look
upon
some
surpassing
embodiment
of
innocent
and
modest
female
loveliness
when
the
mind
jealous
of
led
captive
so
to
speak
the
heart
in
revolt
against
the
revealed
law
the
human
being
was
no
longer
in
union
with
himself
a
war
of
impulses
and
of
energies
was
set
up
within
him
the
image
of
god
was
defaced
his
perception
of
created
beauty
became
more
and
more
obscure
as
he
went
further
away
from
his
original
abode
of
innocence
until
finally
it
was
all
but
lost
the
emotion
if
we
may
describe
it
as
such
which
it
was
of
its
nature
to
suggest
could
not
perish
for
it
is
imperishable
but
it
had
lost
its
true
object
and
surveyed
knowledge
in
a
form
more
or
less
degraded
now
out
of
this
very
faint
and
rapid
sketch
of
a
psychological
theory
which
would
require
a
volume
for
its
development
we
hope
to
be
able
to
convey
some
idea
however
vague
of
the
nature
of
the
poetic
spirit
it
is
certain
that
the
remains
of
the
divine
image
have
not
since
been
alike
and
equal
in
all
the
individuals
of
the
race
it
may
be
asserted
on
the
contrary
that
there
are
no
two
human
microcosms
in
which
the
elements
of
the
confusion
introduced
into
them
by
the
original
infidelity
exist
in
the
same
proportion
those
in
whom
the
intelligence
is
the
quickest
to
see
and
the
mind
heart
and
soul
to
love
in
unison
the
image
of
divine
beauty
revealed
in
creation
those
that
is
in
whom
the
divine
image
remains
the
most
pronouncedly
are
the
truest
poets
when
this
echo
of
the
soul
to
the
beautiful
does
not
go
beyond
the
physical
creation
the
inspirations
of
love
express
themselves
in
lyric
or
idyllic
poetry
the
poet
imitates
the
divine
creator
in
reproducing
even
creating
images
of
his
lower
creation
so
faithful
and
suggestive
that
they
who
look
upon
them
experience
similar
sensations
and
emotions
to
those
provoked
within
them
by
the
divine
creation
itself
nay
not
unseldom
even
profounder
ones
he
reveals
the
beautiful
in
similar
images
to
those
in
which
the
beautiful
revealed
himself
to
his
creature
he
is
thus
himself
a
ποιητὴς
or
creator
and
his
work
is
a
ποίησις
or
creation
when
his
forms
derive
their
inspiration
only
from
the
inferior
creation
they
are
exclusively
some
form
of
idyls
or
lyrics
but
when
soaring
above
the
grosser
medium
of
the
merely
material
universe
and
poising
himself
on
wings
tremulous
with
reverent
joy
at
the
confines
of
the
invisible
his
soul
echoes
the
music
of
the
beautiful
issuing
from
that
invisible
creation
and
that
imitative
energy
which
is
of
its
essence
inspired
by
these
reawakening
inspirations
calls
into
being
psychical
individualities
with
their
precise
bodily
expression
and
proper
destinies
that
is
to
say
with
all
the
causes
and
results
ebb
and
flow
action
and
reaction
in
human
affairs
of
every
volition
and
energy
he
reproduces
the
highest
energy
of
the
divine
creative
power
he
evokes
into
sensible
existence
whole
multitudes
of
fresh
creatures
made
in
the
image
of
god
and
what
is
even
yet
more
sublime
he
evokes
into
equally
sensible
being
the
particular
providence
which
overrules
each
and
all
the
one
difference
between
the
two
creations
being
that
one
is
original
the
other
imitative
one
imaginary
that
is
sensible
the
other
not
only
sensible
but
also
and
yet
are
the
accidents
of
the
former
produced
occasionally
with
such
extraordinary
fidelity
that
they
have
sometimes
as
in
the
creations
of
shakspere
for
example
the
same
effect
upon
those
who
become
acquainted
with
them
as
if
they
were
in
truth
the
latter
who
that
has
ever
studied
the
creations
of
that
immortal
dramatist
has
not
them
all
from
high
to
low
treasured
within
his
inner
being
as
vividly
as
any
other
of
his
absent
acquaintances
whom
he
has
met
in
society
to
whom
he
has
been
formally
introduced
with
whom
he
has
eaten
drank
laughed
wept
walked
and
conversed
has
not
that
remarkable
genius
transgressed
even
the
imitative
faculty
imitative
that
is
of
all
the
original
creative
energy
that
is
known
produced
original
creations
and
peopled
the
rather
than
supernatural
with
beings
which
have
no
known
existence
but
whom
nevertheless
he
surrounds
with
a
distinct
verisimilitude
which
ensures
them
easy
admission
into
our
minds
and
hearts
which
presents
them
to
our
senses
as
concrete
beings
with
as
much
positiveness
and
even
as
clearly
defined
individuality
as
if
they
were
solid
creatures
of
flesh
and
bone
and
which
makes
us
feel
that
if
such
beings
did
really
exist
they
would
be
none
other
than
precisely
those
he
has
represented
of
such
sort
we
take
it
is
the
highest
or
dramatic
poetry
and
of
it
there
is
a
manifest
deficiency
in
this
work
which
its
author
terms
indeed
a
drama
but
which
is
in
fact
a
tragedy
tennyson
has
not
enough
of
the
divine
afflatus
to
write
tragedy
if
he
has
not
sufficient
love
of
the
beautiful
in
inanimate
nature
for
his
soul
to
echo
to
it
and
his
heart
to
throb
with
the
sense
of
it
with
the
rapidity
of
an
intuition
so
as
to
make
unattainable
to
him
the
highest
excellence
in
lyric
poetry
how
much
more
out
of
his
reach
must
be
a
first
rank
in
the
tragic
drama
where
if
anywhere
an
intuition
of
the
beautiful
amounting
to
an
inspiration
is
demanded
in
that
supreme
creation
of
god
which
as
the
consummation
of
his
and
word
he
has
embodied
in
his
own
substance
in
that
profound
and
intuitive
perception
of
the
workings
of
inner
being
of
the
passions
emotions
feelings
appetites
their
action
and
reaction
ebb
and
flow
of
the
struggle
of
the
two
natures
its
infinite
variety
and
play
of
life
under
all
conceivable
conditions
and
vicissitudes
with
much
more
than
can
be
detailed
here
included
in
these
tennyson
is
strikingly
deficient
in
the
tragedies
of
shakspere
as
in
all
his
dramas
the
distinct
personality
of
every
one
of
the
characters
high
and
low
is
impressed
upon
us
with
vivid
distinctness
but
the
principal
personages
in
the
tragedies
dilate
before
us
in
heroic
proportions
as
the
portentous
struggle
progresses
whether
it
be
king
lear
or
king
john
or
king
richard
or
othello
or
lady
macbeth
or
lady
constance
or
the
widowed
princess
of
wales
or
ophelia
or
whoever
else
we
look
on
with
bated
breath
as
did
the
spectators
of
the
with
which
æneas
celebrated
the
suicide
of
his
regal
paramour
and
we
come
away
at
its
close
a
prey
to
the
storm
of
emotions
which
the
magic
art
of
the
island
sorcerer
has
conjured
up
within
us
but
the
drama
or
tragedy
as
we
prefer
to
call
it
we
read
with
but
languid
interest
the
psychical
struggle
is
neither
very
obvious
nor
very
critical
there
is
no
very
striking
revelation
of
the
sublime
beauty
or
tragic
overthrow
of
human
nature
and
although
the
canvas
is
crowded
with
figures
not
one
of
them
impresses
any
very
distinct
image
of
his
or
her
individuality
on
our
mind
and
heart
instead
of
as
creations
retaining
every
one
of
them
as
a
distinct
and
intimate
acquaintance
whom
we
may
summon
into
our
company
at
will
we
rise
from
the
perusal
of
without
having
received
any
very
definite
impression
of
any
even
the
principal
personages
and
we
forget
all
about
them
almost
as
soon
as
we
have
read
the
play
this
vital
defect
in
a
drama
the
author
has
rendered
doubly
fatal
through
his
having
carried
his
imitation
of
shakspere
to
the
extent
of
adopting
his
simplicity
of
plot
shakspere
could
afford
to
do
this
the
inspired
verisimilitude
of
the
struggle
of
the
two
natures
in
every
one
of
his
human
creations
the
profoundness
of
his
development
of
the
innermost
working
of
the
human
microcosm
often
by
a
few
surround
every
one
of
his
with
all
the
rapt
suspense
and
sustained
interest
of
a
plot
every
one
of
his
characters
is
as
it
were
a
plot
in
itself
but
it
is
quite
certain
that
tennyson
and
it
is
no
depreciation
of
him
has
not
this
power
he
has
therefore
every
right
to
call
to
his
aid
the
interest
of
an
elaborate
plot
which
itself
would
also
we
think
cause
him
to
develop
more
vividly
his
characters
it
is
in
this
the
late
lord
lytton
whose
poetical
pretensions
are
very
much
below
achieved
whatever
success
he
had
as
a
dramatist
tennyson
has
not
to
depend
on
this
solely
as
was
very
nearly
the
case
with
lord
lytton
but
it
would
contribute
very
much
to
a
higher
success
the
great
dramatist
he
is
unwise
enough
so
avowedly
to
imitate
peoples
the
simplest
plot
with
a
whole
world
of
stirring
destinies
he
moves
his
quickening
wand
and
lo
as
by
the
of
a
creator
appear
a
hamlet
or
a
malvolio
a
lady
macbeth
or
a
goneril
or
miranda
an
ariel
or
a
caliban
contribute
their
precise
share
to
the
history
which
would
not
have
been
complete
without
them
and
then
disappear
from
the
scene
but
never
from
our
memory
a
magic
word
or
two
has
smitten
them
into
and
they
live
for
aye
in
our
mind
and
heart
his
heroes
and
his
heroines
he
clothes
with
such
a
majesty
of
poetry
that
we
watch
anxiously
with
bated
breath
their
every
gesture
word
or
look
we
can
not
bear
their
absence
until
entranced
into
their
destiny
and
half
unconscious
we
watch
them
disappear
in
the
catastrophe
our
ears
are
blank
all
voices
mute
the
brilliant
theatre
is
the
chamber
of
death
and
they
who
to
us
were
but
now
living
flesh
and
blood
in
whose
destinies
our
innermost
soul
was
rapt
have
passed
away
amidst
a
tempest
of
emotions
and
are
no
more
but
of
the
peloponnesian
either
of
the
two
great
classic
epics
or
any
striking
historic
passage
in
even
so
ungraphic
a
writer
as
lingard
is
more
dramatic
than
this
drama
the
feeble
plot
gives
birth
to
feebler
impersonations
they
come
and
go
without
making
any
deep
impression
upon
us
or
seizing
our
attention
by
any
striking
originality
their
features
are
indistinct
their
actions
insignificant
they
are
bloodless
and
colorless
they
are
ghosts
things
of
air
whom
a
feeble
incantation
has
summoned
from
their
slumber
who
mutter
a
few
laborious
spartanisms
in
a
renewed
life
in
which
they
seem
to
have
no
concern
and
vanish
without
provoking
a
regret
nor
even
an
emotion
we
observe
in
them
such
an
absence
of
verisimilitude
so
marked
a
want
of
truth
to
nature
as
very
much
to
weaken
when
it
does
not
entirely
destroy
the
dramatic
illusion
nowhere
is
this
more
observable
than
where
he
intends
most
manifestly
a
rivalry
of
shakspere
shakspere
not
unseldom
introduces
the
multitude
into
his
poetic
history
but
when
he
does
so
it
seizes
our
interest
as
forcibly
as
his
more
important
personages
with
a
few
rapid
touches
he
dashes
in
a
few
typical
individuals
who
reveal
to
us
vividly
what
the
whole
kind
of
thing
is
of
which
they
are
prominent
units
they
are
the
mob
of
the
very
time
and
place
to
which
they
belong
whether
at
rome
in
the
time
of
julius
cæsar
or
at
mantua
or
verona
in
the
middle
ages
or
in
england
during
the
time
of
the
tudors
we
feel
that
they
act
and
speak
just
as
then
and
there
they
might
have
said
and
done
every
one
too
has
his
or
her
distinct
individuality
and
such
a
verisimilitude
have
they
that
even
an
occasional
anachronism
such
as
in
and
making
a
trojan
servant
talk
of
in
the
state
of
does
not
dispel
the
charm
but
have
no
more
striking
features
to
seize
our
interest
than
his
more
exalted
creations
whilst
his
anachronisms
are
of
a
kind
which
send
all
verisimilitude
to
the
winds
joan
and
tib
and
the
four
or
five
citizens
have
nothing
in
them
for
which
they
should
be
singled
out
of
the
very
ordinary
condition
of
life
to
which
they
belong
and
we
are
tempted
to
sneer
when
we
hear
an
elizabethan
mob
talking
like
hampshire
or
yorkshire
peasants
of
the
present
day
for
all
that
cockneys
and
rustics
are
not
his
most
ineffective
portraiture
we
experience
a
slight
sensation
of
their
having
been
lugged
in
perhaps
because
of
the
inevitable
comparison
with
shakspere
they
provoke
and
we
feel
them
to
be
too
modern
but
the
sense
of
humor
here
serves
him
in
good
stead
and
although
in
this
respect
immeasurably
below
shakspere
he
gives
a
kind
of
raciness
to
his
plebeians
which
saves
them
from
being
an
absolute
failure
it
is
however
in
the
principal
personages
of
the
drama
that
we
most
miss
the
promethean
fire
and
in
the
hero
if
cranmer
is
intended
for
such
a
dignity
and
the
heroine
amongst
these
the
most
lifelike
are
courtenay
and
sir
thomas
wyatt
because
in
their
creation
the
peculiar
vein
of
quaint
irony
and
exceedingly
refined
humor
which
is
most
eminent
distinction
comes
to
his
aid
for
the
rest
up
to
the
heroine
herself
and
the
canting
and
recanting
cranmer
they
are
colorless
and
bloodless
we
scarcely
know
one
from
the
other
and
we
do
not
care
to
noailles
and
renard
are
but
poor
specimens
of
diplomatists
their
sovereigns
were
the
time
the
present
might
pick
up
a
dozen
such
any
day
in
wall
street
if
the
poet
could
embody
no
greater
conception
of
two
such
men
as
bonner
and
gardiner
than
a
couple
of
vulgar
knaves
he
should
have
dispensed
altogether
with
their
presence
he
should
have
given
to
them
some
elevation
whatever
history
may
say
about
it
a
drama
is
a
poem
not
a
history
and
the
poet
may
take
the
names
of
historic
personages
and
within
certain
limits
fit
to
them
creations
of
his
own
in
cardinal
pole
he
had
an
opportunity
for
a
noble
ideal
but
all
we
have
is
an
amiable
dummy
an
old
gentleman
as
ordinary
and
ineffective
as
the
rest
facts
have
been
so
distorted
by
the
influence
which
for
so
long
had
sole
possession
of
literature
that
there
is
plenty
of
room
for
taking
great
liberties
with
history
tennyson
has
slightly
availed
himself
of
this
but
in
the
wrong
direction
shakspere
himself
could
not
have
made
a
saint
of
cranmer
for
poetry
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
make
him
a
more
splendid
sinner
to
retain
all
his
littlenesses
and
to
array
them
in
seductive
virtues
is
to
present
us
with
some
such
figure
as
the
dusky
chieftains
decked
in
gaudy
tinsel
that
solicit
our
admiration
in
front
of
the
shops
to
attempt
to
give
heroic
proportions
to
a
man
whose
profession
of
faith
followed
subserviently
his
until
no
hope
remained
and
then
place
in
the
hands
of
the
burning
criminal
the
palm
of
martyrdom
is
to
invite
the
love
within
us
of
the
beautiful
and
the
true
to
echo
to
a
psychical
impossibility
and
that
without
an
element
of
greatness
yet
had
the
front
figure
of
the
history
been
a
noble
conception
grandly
executed
all
this
might
have
been
condoned
one
might
well
have
looked
at
them
as
a
few
rough
accessories
to
heighten
by
their
contrast
the
beauty
of
the
central
form
there
was
place
for
a
splendid
creation
no
more
favorable
material
for
a
tragic
heroine
exists
than
mary
tudor
with
the
single
exception
of
that
other
mary
who
fell
beneath
the
puritans
like
a
lily
before
the
scythe
of
the
destroyer
around
her
history
and
person
circle
all
the
elements
of
the
tenderest
pathos
which
is
of
the
very
essence
of
tragedy
that
shakspere
did
not
use
them
is
a
proof
he
thought
so
for
fair
vestal
throned
in
the
would
have
resented
such
a
creation
as
his
quickening
genius
would
have
called
to
life
a
queen
of
noble
nature
gradually
swept
away
by
a
resistless
current
of
untoward
circumstances
is
a
history
capable
of
the
sublimity
of
a
greek
catastrophe
with
the
added
pathos
of
christian
suffering
but
who
have
we
here
a
silly
woman
devoutly
pious
and
endowed
with
a
conspicuous
share
of
the
family
courage
but
she
is
so
weak
that
her
piety
has
the
appearance
of
superstition
and
her
fits
of
courage
lose
their
royalty
and
fail
to
rescue
her
from
contempt
unattractive
in
person
she
falls
desperately
in
love
with
a
man
much
younger
than
herself
and
her
love
ordinarily
so
quick
to
detect
coldness
in
a
lover
is
blind
to
the
grossest
neglect
and
yet
not
so
blind
but
that
a
few
words
scrawled
on
a
rag
of
paper
dropped
in
her
way
could
open
her
eyes
on
the
spot
the
tenderness
of
her
love
and
the
importunity
of
men
transform
her
almost
suddenly
from
a
woman
to
an
unrelenting
human
tigress
and
she
who
would
not
allow
the
law
to
take
its
course
on
her
most
dangerous
enemies
can
exclaim
of
her
sister
elizabeth
the
tower
with
my
foes
are
at
my
feet
and
i
am
afterwards
of
guilford
dudley
the
duke
of
suffolk
and
lady
jane
grey
shall
and
again
of
her
sister
shall
die
my
foes
are
at
my
feet
and
philip
this
is
not
the
grandness
of
crime
as
in
richard
or
even
in
lady
macbeth
it
is
the
petty
despotism
of
a
weak
and
silly
woman
there
is
no
greatness
of
any
kind
about
it
it
is
the
mere
triumphant
chuckle
of
an
amorous
queen
wooing
a
more
than
indifferent
husband
it
is
little
little
enough
for
a
comedy
there
is
something
approaching
the
tragic
in
the
desolation
of
her
last
moments
calais
is
lost
her
husband
hates
her
her
people
hate
her
but
the
poet
has
already
robbed
her
of
the
dignity
of
her
position
she
has
forfeited
our
esteem
we
experience
an
ordinary
sympathy
with
her
but
her
fate
is
only
what
was
to
be
expected
and
the
highest
pathos
is
out
of
the
question
when
following
the
example
of
her
injured
mother
in
the
play
of
she
betakes
herself
to
lute
and
song
the
author
insists
on
a
comparison
with
shakspere
and
beside
the
full
notes
of
the
bard
of
avon
the
petty
treble
of
the
laureate
pipe
shrinks
to
mediocrity
but
the
most
unpardonable
of
imitations
of
shakspere
are
those
in
which
he
rings
the
changes
on
the
celebrated
passage
about
italian
priest
shall
tithe
nor
toll
in
our
dominions
which
inevitably
provokes
the
applause
of
those
amongst
a
theatrical
audience
who
do
not
know
what
it
means
unpardonable
because
it
makes
even
shakspere
himself
as
ridiculous
as
a
poor
travesty
can
not
fail
to
do
he
was
content
with
one
such
passage
throughout
his
many
plays
if
terence
had
filtered
the
noble
sentiment
of
his
celebrated
passage
homo
sum
et
nihil
humanum
a
me
alienum
through
a
variety
of
forms
it
would
have
excited
the
laughter
instead
of
the
plaudits
of
the
roman
but
the
author
of
is
not
afraid
to
pose
sentiment
itself
borrowed
in
no
less
than
three
different
attitudes
in
one
play
committing
the
additional
absurdity
of
thrusting
it
like
a
quid
of
tobacco
into
the
cheek
of
two
different
personages
gardiner
uses
it
twice
elizabeth
once
i
know
well
says
the
former
your
people
will
brook
nor
pope
nor
spaniard
here
to
play
the
tyrant
or
in
commonwealth
or
and
again
with
questionable
taste
see
you
we
shall
have
to
again
and
let
the
pope
trample
our
rights
and
plunge
his
into
our
island
church
to
plump
the
leaner
pouch
of
whilst
elizabeth
is
made
to
vulgarize
it
beyond
hope
of
redemption
into
a
mere
petty
ebullition
of
splenetic
womanly
vanity
queen
indeed
no
foreign
prince
or
priest
should
fill
my
throne
myself
upon
the
it
must
be
owned
indeed
that
this
play
lacks
the
highest
poetry
in
its
expression
as
much
as
in
its
conception
we
occasionally
come
across
passages
of
vivid
and
vigorous
limning
as
count
reply
to
elizabeth
towards
the
end
of
the
play
and
description
to
the
lord
mayor
of
the
state
of
mind
of
the
citizens
but
even
the
force
of
this
latter
passage
is
not
dramatic
there
is
none
of
the
rush
and
movement
of
an
excited
populace
there
are
a
few
striking
groups
but
they
are
inactive
theirs
is
a
kind
of
dead
life
if
we
may
be
pardoned
such
an
expression
rather
they
are
mere
they
inspire
us
with
no
fear
for
throne
more
near
to
dramatic
power
and
beauty
is
soliloquy
at
woodstock
suddenly
lowered
in
the
midst
of
its
poetry
even
to
nursery
familiarity
by
the
introduction
of
such
a
phrase
as
me
who
but
for
one
single
effort
of
the
highest
poetic
flight
we
look
in
vain
even
the
few
snatches
of
his
lyre
which
he
introduces
fail
to
woo
us
they
are
not
natural
if
they
are
poetry
it
is
poetry
in
a
it
is
rich
with
brocade
and
the
jewels
glitter
bravely
it
treads
delicately
but
its
movements
are
artificial
and
constrained
compare
for
example
the
song
of
the
woodstock
milkmaid
wherein
labor
is
visible
in
every
line
with
those
gushes
of
nature
with
which
the
soul
would
seem
to
be
bubbling
over
the
brim
of
the
visible
in
the
various
lyrical
snatches
of
ariel
or
with
the
song
of
spring
at
the
end
of
labor
but
what
has
more
surprised
us
than
the
lack
of
the
poetic
inspiration
in
this
drama
is
the
occasional
want
of
correct
taste
in
a
writer
of
such
exceeding
polish
as
tennyson
such
a
speech
as
god
hath
blest
or
cursed
me
with
a
nose
your
boots
are
from
the
horses
should
not
have
been
put
in
the
mouth
of
a
lady
still
less
a
lady
of
the
rank
of
elizabeth
and
that
the
less
when
she
appeals
to
our
sympathies
from
a
kind
of
honorable
imprisonment
lady
magdalen
dacres
may
have
beat
king
philip
with
a
staff
for
insulting
her
and
have
remained
a
lady
but
we
do
not
want
to
be
told
in
the
midst
of
dramatic
pathos
by
providence
a
good
stout
staff
lay
near
me
and
you
know
me
strong
of
arm
i
do
believe
i
lamed
his
is
our
poet
again
so
barren
of
invention
that
he
could
find
no
other
way
of
portraying
indifference
to
his
queen
than
the
following
james
i
do
protest
upon
the
faith
and
honor
of
a
spaniard
i
am
vastly
grieved
to
leave
your
majesty
simon
is
supper
ready
ay
my
liege
i
saw
the
covers
have
whatever
may
be
the
character
he
may
have
wished
to
depict
in
philip
we
expect
a
spanish
king
to
be
a
gentleman
and
such
an
ending
of
a
scene
susceptible
of
the
tenderest
pathos
where
the
heroine
and
another
of
the
principal
personages
of
the
drama
are
in
presence
argues
a
wonderful
dulness
of
perception
of
the
beautiful
worse
than
all
however
is
his
treatment
of
cardinal
pole
shakspere
puts
a
few
words
of
latin
into
the
mouth
of
cardinal
wolsey
in
a
scene
in
in
which
he
and
cardinal
campeggio
are
endeavoring
to
bend
the
queen
to
the
will
but
it
is
a
wonderful
touch
of
nature
it
is
one
of
those
profound
intuitions
for
which
the
great
dramatist
is
so
distinguished
so
seemingly
simple
an
incident
reveals
at
a
touch
as
it
were
the
preoccupation
of
mind
and
the
hollowness
at
once
and
difficulty
of
the
duty
he
had
suffered
to
be
imposed
upon
him
they
had
paid
her
ostensibly
a
private
visit
as
friends
but
wolsey
oppressed
with
the
difficulty
of
his
undertaking
and
meditating
how
he
should
set
about
it
forgets
himself
the
old
habit
crops
up
and
he
begins
as
if
he
were
beginning
a
formal
ecclesiastical
document
est
erga
te
mentis
integritas
regina
it
is
a
slip
the
queen
stops
him
he
recollects
himself
and
we
hear
no
more
latin
but
in
this
drama
the
poet
literally
makes
a
cardinal
and
such
a
cardinal
as
pole
address
queen
mary
with
the
angelic
salutation
to
the
blessed
virgin
and
in
latin
maria
gratia
plena
benedicta
tu
in
mulieribus
upon
the
whole
the
defects
of
this
drama
are
so
many
and
so
serious
so
radical
and
fundamental
that
no
competent
criticism
can
pronounce
it
other
than
a
failure
and
a
failure
more
complete
than
would
have
been
thought
possible
to
a
poet
of
so
great
a
reputation
as
mr
tennyson
valde
decora
could
i
but
see
thee
dear
my
love
that
face
but
once
not
dazzling
bright
not
as
the
blest
above
behold
it
in
light
but
as
it
at
la
salette
or
when
in
pyrenean
wild
it
on
bernadette
the
peasant
child
once
seen
a
moment
it
would
blind
these
eyes
to
beauty
less
than
thine
and
where
could
poet
find
such
theme
for
song
as
mine
but
if
i
ask
what
may
not
be
so
spell
me
with
thy
face
that
haunting
looks
from
thee
may
hold
me
like
a
grace
are
you
my
wife
by
the
author
of
before
the
war
thirteen
etc
chapter
ix
and
now
a
new
life
began
for
franceline
must
fly
from
idleness
as
from
sin
father
henwick
said
must
never
let
a
regret
settle
on
your
mind
for
an
instant
it
will
often
be
hard
work
to
resist
them
but
we
are
here
to
fight
you
must
shut
the
door
in
the
face
of
idle
thoughts
by
activity
and
usefulness
i
will
help
you
in
this
you
must
set
to
work
amongst
the
poor
not
so
as
to
fatigue
yourself
or
interfere
with
your
duties
and
occupations
at
home
but
enough
to
keep
you
busy
and
interested
at
first
it
will
be
irksome
enough
i
dare
say
but
never
mind
that
by
and
by
the
effort
will
bring
its
own
reward
and
be
a
pleasure
as
well
as
a
he
sat
down
and
wrote
out
a
for
her
which
filled
up
every
hour
of
the
day
and
left
not
one
moment
for
brooding
there
were
visits
to
the
cottages
and
a
class
for
children
in
the
morning
the
afternoon
hours
were
to
be
devoted
to
helping
her
father
writing
and
copying
for
him
sometimes
copying
mss
for
father
henwick
with
no
other
purpose
than
to
keep
her
mind
and
her
fingers
occupied
but
when
the
excitement
caused
by
this
change
in
her
daily
routine
subsided
something
of
the
first
returned
do
what
she
would
thought
would
not
be
dumb
the
external
activity
could
not
silence
the
busy
tongues
of
her
brain
or
deafen
her
to
their
ceaseless
whisperings
it
was
weary
work
staggering
on
under
her
load
while
memory
tugged
at
her
and
dragged
its
longings
the
other
way
it
was
hard
not
to
yield
to
the
temptation
now
and
then
of
sitting
down
by
the
wayside
to
rest
and
look
back
towards
the
egypt
that
was
for
ever
out
of
sight
but
franceline
very
seldom
yielded
to
the
treacherous
allurement
when
she
caught
herself
lapsing
into
dreams
she
would
rise
up
with
a
resolute
effort
and
shake
off
the
torpor
and
set
to
work
at
something
when
the
torpor
changed
to
a
sting
of
anguish
she
would
steep
her
soul
in
prayer
that
unfailing
opiate
of
the
suffering
spirit
its
chloroform
in
pain
one
day
about
three
weeks
after
father
return
she
was
coming
home
through
the
wood
after
her
round
amongst
the
cottages
she
was
very
tired
in
mind
and
body
it
was
dull
work
dinning
the
into
bessy
thick
skull
and
teaching
her
unnimble
fingers
to
turn
the
heel
of
a
stocking
to
listen
to
the
endless
lamentations
over
dear
and
the
good
old
times
when
they
killed
a
pig
every
year
and
always
had
a
bit
of
bacon
on
the
rack
franceline
came
to
the
old
spot
where
she
used
to
sit
and
listen
to
the
concert
of
the
grove
the
songsters
were
nearly
all
silent
now
for
the
green
was
turning
gold
but
the
felled
tree
was
lying
in
the
same
place
and
tempted
her
to
rest
a
moment
and
watch
the
sun
shooting
his
golden
shafts
through
the
wilderness
of
stems
all
round
another
moment
and
she
was
in
dreamland
but
the
spell
had
scarcely
fallen
on
her
when
it
was
broken
by
the
sound
of
footfalls
crushing
the
yellow
leaves
that
made
a
carpet
on
every
path
she
started
to
her
feet
and
walked
on
a
few
steps
brought
her
face
to
face
with
father
henwick
he
greeted
her
with
a
joyous
exclamation
comes
my
little
missionary
what
has
she
been
doing
has
achieved
a
great
conquest
she
has
arrived
at
making
bessy
bing
apprehend
the
problem
that
seven
times
nine
and
nine
times
seven
produce
one
and
the
same
total
replied
franceline
with
mock
gravity
father
henwick
laughed
but
the
tired
expression
of
her
face
did
not
escape
him
am
afraid
you
will
be
growing
too
conceited
if
this
sort
of
thing
goes
on
he
said
you
must
not
overdo
it
my
dear
child
it
do
to
wear
yourself
out
in
gaining
arithmetical
wear
out
than
rust
and
franceline
shrugged
her
shoulders
she
had
learned
the
expressive
french
trick
from
her
father
the
priest
bent
his
clear
eyes
on
her
for
a
second
without
speaking
she
read
disappointment
and
perhaps
mild
reproach
in
them
am
sorry
i
said
that
father
i
did
not
mean
to
are
you
sorry
it
was
cowardly
and
whom
you
who
are
so
kind
and
so
patient
with
me
who
bids
me
be
kind
who
teaches
me
to
be
patient
with
you
poor
little
bruised
lamb
know
it
father
i
feel
it
in
the
bottom
of
my
heart
but
one
always
be
there
was
the
slightest
touch
of
impatience
in
her
tone
if
god
were
some
day
to
grow
tired
of
remembering
us
and
bearing
with
us
and
forgiving
us
know
but
i
am
not
rebelling
only
sickening
and
suffering
you
have
told
me
there
was
no
sin
in
that
the
words
came
tremulous
as
if
through
rising
tears
but
franceline
raised
her
head
with
a
defiant
movement
and
forced
the
briny
drops
down
can
not
help
it
she
continued
impetuously
have
tried
my
best
and
i
can
not
help
it
father
henwick
heaved
an
almost
inaudible
sigh
before
he
said
can
not
you
help
franceline
suffering
i
care
about
that
remembering
i
can
not
poor
child
would
to
god
i
could
help
you
i
would
suffer
willingly
in
your
place
the
words
came
like
a
gush
from
his
inmost
heart
they
broke
down
the
proud
resistance
and
let
the
tears
have
vent
he
turned
to
walk
back
with
her
for
some
time
neither
spoke
only
the
soft
sobs
that
came
unchecked
from
franceline
broke
the
stillness
of
the
wood
suddenly
she
cried
out
in
a
tone
of
passionate
desperation
father
it
is
dreadful
it
will
kill
me
if
it
lasts
much
longer
the
humiliation
is
more
than
i
can
bear
to
feel
that
i
am
harboring
a
feeling
that
my
whole
soul
rebels
against
that
is
revolting
in
the
eyes
of
god
and
of
my
conscience
and
i
can
not
master
it
will
never
master
it
by
pride
franceline
that
very
pride
is
your
greatest
hindrance
in
setting
your
heart
free
try
and
think
more
of
god
and
less
of
yourself
there
is
no
sin
as
you
say
in
the
suffering
any
more
than
if
you
strayed
to
the
edge
of
a
precipice
in
the
dark
and
fell
over
and
were
killed
you
would
be
guilty
of
suicide
the
sinfulness
now
is
in
your
rebellion
against
the
suffering
simply
because
it
wounds
your
is
not
all
pride
father
she
said
meekly
presently
she
turned
and
looked
up
at
him
through
wet
lashes
i
must
tell
you
something
she
said
speaking
with
a
sort
of
timidity
that
was
unusual
with
her
towards
him
thought
that
came
to
me
this
morning
that
never
came
to
me
was
it
his
wife
should
die
he
would
be
free
a
dark
shadow
fell
now
on
father
large
smooth
brow
franceline
read
his
answer
in
the
frown
and
the
averted
gaze
but
he
spoke
soon
though
he
did
not
look
at
her
was
a
sinful
thought
you
should
have
cast
it
behind
you
with
contempt
has
it
come
to
that
with
you
that
you
could
look
forward
to
the
death
of
any
one
as
a
thing
to
be
longed
for
did
not
long
for
it
the
thought
came
to
should
have
hunted
it
out
of
your
mind
like
an
evil
spirit
as
it
was
you
must
never
let
it
near
you
again
should
be
to
you
as
if
he
were
already
dead
whether
his
wife
dies
or
not
should
not
and
does
not
concern
you
besides
how
do
you
know
whether
she
is
not
as
young
as
yourself
and
stronger
my
child
such
a
thought
as
that
would
lead
you
to
the
brink
of
an
abyss
if
you
listened
to
never
will
again
father
she
answered
promptly
hardly
know
now
whether
i
listened
to
it
or
not
only
i
could
not
help
telling
were
right
to
tell
me
and
now
banish
it
and
never
let
it
approach
you
after
a
pause
he
resumed
are
sure
that
silence
is
best
with
de
la
bourbonais
yes
how
can
you
ask
me
father
and
franceline
looked
up
in
surprise
it
can
not
remain
a
secret
from
him
for
ever
he
is
almost
certain
to
hear
of
it
sooner
or
later
and
it
might
save
him
a
severe
shock
if
he
heard
it
from
you
it
would
set
his
mind
at
rest
about
you
is
quite
at
rest
at
present
on
that
score
he
has
no
idea
that
the
discovery
would
be
likely
to
affect
are
better
able
to
judge
of
that
of
course
than
i
am
but
it
grieves
me
to
see
you
have
a
secret
from
your
father
i
wish
it
could
be
it
can
not
indeed
it
can
not
she
repeated
emphatically
may
trust
me
to
speak
if
i
thought
it
could
be
done
without
injury
to
both
of
us
it
is
much
better
to
wait
perhaps
by
the
time
it
comes
to
his
ears
i
may
be
able
to
hear
him
speak
of
it
without
betraying
myself
and
paining
father
henwick
acquiesced
but
reluctantly
he
hoped
she
was
right
in
supposing
de
la
bourbonais
quite
blind
to
what
had
been
so
palpable
to
a
casual
observer
but
making
even
the
fullest
allowance
for
the
habits
of
the
studious
man
this
seemed
scarcely
probable
franceline
had
affirmed
it
herself
more
confidently
perhaps
than
was
warranted
she
had
however
succeeded
in
lulling
her
father
into
forgetfulness
of
his
former
conjectures
and
impressions
she
was
certain
of
this
it
had
been
done
at
a
terrible
price
of
endurance
and
but
she
had
succeeded
and
it
would
be
doubly
cruel
now
to
revive
his
suspicions
and
let
him
know
the
truth
will
trust
you
said
father
henwick
is
indeed
a
mercy
that
he
is
not
called
upon
to
bear
such
a
trial
while
he
is
yet
so
there
was
an
earnestness
about
him
as
he
said
this
that
would
have
caused
franceline
a
deeper
emotion
than
curiosity
if
her
mind
were
not
fixed
wide
of
the
mark
she
replied
after
a
reflection
anything
should
occur
to
make
it
necessary
to
tell
him
will
you
break
it
to
him
father
will
said
the
priest
simply
franceline
had
not
the
least
fear
of
father
henwick
the
severity
of
his
passionless
brow
did
not
frighten
her
it
never
checked
the
outflow
of
the
thoughts
and
emotions
that
came
surging
up
from
her
own
perturbed
heart
he
seemed
too
far
removed
from
strife
himself
to
be
affected
by
it
except
as
a
pitying
angel
might
looking
down
from
his
calm
heaven
on
poor
mortals
struggling
and
striving
in
the
smoke
and
din
of
their
earthly
said
franceline
suddenly
wish
i
cared
more
for
the
poor
i
wish
i
could
love
them
and
pity
them
as
you
do
but
i
so
shy
of
going
amongst
them
sure
i
do
them
any
good
and
they
do
me
any
good
so
prosy
and
egotistical
most
of
them
at
he
turned
an
amused
indulgent
smile
on
her
was
a
time
when
i
thought
so
too
but
persevere
and
the
love
will
come
after
a
little
while
all
that
is
worth
having
is
bought
with
sacrifice
oh
if
we
could
only
understand
the
blessedness
of
sacrifice
then
we
should
find
the
peace
passing
all
understanding
that
comes
of
passion
overcome
of
sorrow
generously
accepted
he
held
out
his
hand
to
say
franceline
laid
hers
in
it
but
did
not
remove
it
at
once
she
said
with
her
eyes
lifted
in
childlike
fearlessness
to
his
would
think
to
hear
you
speak
of
passion
overcome
and
sorrow
accepted
that
you
knew
something
about
them
i
sometimes
wish
you
did
it
would
make
it
easier
to
me
to
believe
in
the
possibility
of
overcoming
and
a
change
came
over
father
face
for
one
moment
it
was
not
a
cloud
nor
a
tremor
but
the
shadow
of
some
deep
emotion
that
must
pass
away
before
he
could
answer
then
the
words
came
with
grave
simplicity
and
low
as
if
they
were
a
prayer
then
my
child
and
take
courage
i
have
gone
through
it
all
he
turned
and
walked
back
into
the
wood
franceline
stood
looking
after
him
through
gathering
never
had
he
seemed
so
far
above
her
so
removed
from
human
weakness
as
at
this
moment
when
he
so
humbly
acknowledged
kindred
with
it
a
pleasant
surprise
met
franceline
on
her
return
home
sir
simon
was
at
the
lilies
and
loudly
expressing
his
indignation
at
not
finding
her
there
to
greet
him
she
arrived
however
before
he
had
quite
divested
himself
of
a
cargo
of
small
boxes
which
he
had
carried
down
himself
in
order
to
have
the
delight
of
witnessing
her
curiosity
and
pleasure
in
their
contents
there
was
hardly
any
event
which
could
have
given
her
so
much
pleasure
in
her
present
frame
of
mind
as
the
sight
of
her
kind
old
friend
and
she
satisfied
him
to
the
full
by
her
affectionate
welcome
and
her
delight
in
all
his
presents
he
had
not
forgotten
her
favorite
chocolate
bonbons
and
she
set
to
nibbling
them
at
once
in
spite
of
protest
against
such
a
proceeding
close
on
petite
gourmande
exclaimed
the
tramping
off
to
her
kitchen
in
high
glee
to
see
gayety
and
innocent
greediness
over
the
dainty
sir
simon
was
if
possible
in
brighter
spirits
than
ever
like
friends
he
was
of
discourse
so
that
there
was
nothing
to
do
but
listen
and
laugh
as
the
current
rippled
on
he
had
a
deal
to
tell
about
his
rambles
in
the
pyrenees
and
a
whole
budget
of
adventures
to
retail
and
anecdotes
about
odd
people
he
had
come
across
in
all
sorts
of
places
nothing
checked
the
pleasant
flow
until
de
la
bourbonais
had
the
unlucky
inspiration
to
inquire
for
lady
health
whereupon
the
baronet
raised
his
right
hand
and
let
it
fall
again
with
an
emphatic
gesture
shook
his
head
and
compressed
his
lips
in
ominous
silence
raymond
who
held
the
key
of
the
pantomime
gathered
therefrom
that
lady
rebecca
had
for
the
time
rallied
from
the
jaws
of
death
and
plunged
her
heir
once
more
into
dejection
and
disappointment
he
knew
what
was
in
store
for
his
private
ear
and
heaved
a
sigh
the
present
hour
shall
be
a
respite
sir
simon
seemed
to
say
and
he
quitted
the
subject
abruptly
and
proceeded
to
catechise
franceline
on
her
behavior
since
his
departure
he
was
surprised
and
annoyed
to
find
that
she
had
been
to
no
parties
that
nothing
more
exciting
than
that
short
visit
to
rydal
had
come
of
his
scheme
with
the
dowager
and
that
there
had
been
no
rivalry
of
gallant
suitors
attacking
the
citadel
of
the
lilies
he
had
been
rather
nervous
before
meeting
her
for
though
it
had
been
made
quite
clear
to
him
by
letters
that
had
received
no
crushing
blow
of
any
description
sir
simon
had
a
lurking
fear
that
recent
events
might
have
left
a
deeper
shadow
on
his
existence
than
he
was
conscious
of
her
aspect
however
set
him
at
ease
on
this
score
he
could
hardly
have
lighted
on
a
more
favorable
moment
for
the
confirmation
of
his
sanguine
hopes
regarding
true
she
had
been
crying
only
half
an
hour
ago
bitter
burning
tears
enough
but
her
face
retained
no
trace
of
them
and
it
still
held
the
glow
of
inward
triumph
that
father
last
words
had
called
up
into
her
eyes
and
her
cheeks
had
got
a
faint
color
from
the
rapid
walking
sir
simon
breathed
freely
as
he
took
note
of
these
outward
signs
he
could
indulge
in
a
little
chaffing
without
remorse
or
he
wanted
to
know
merely
as
a
matter
of
curiosity
how
many
hearts
she
had
broken
in
his
absence
how
many
unfortunates
had
been
mortally
struck
as
they
passed
within
reach
of
her
arrows
on
the
wayside
franceline
protested
that
she
carried
no
quiver
and
had
not
inflicted
a
scratch
on
any
one
humph
sir
simon
invited
her
to
convey
that
answer
to
the
marines
how
about
ponsonby
anwyll
has
he
been
here
lately
he
called
twice
but
papa
and
i
were
devil
so
much
the
better
for
him
but
he
have
the
sense
to
keep
out
of
way
be
at
it
again
before
franceline
gave
one
of
her
merry
laughs
she
was
in
a
mood
to
enjoy
the
absurdity
of
the
joke
and
went
to
take
off
her
things
for
angélique
put
in
her
head
to
say
that
dinner
was
ready
things
fell
quickly
into
their
old
course
at
the
court
there
was
a
procession
of
morning
callers
every
day
and
pleasant
friendly
dinners
and
a
few
men
down
in
relays
to
shoot
sir
simon
insisted
on
de
la
bourbonais
coming
to
join
them
frequently
and
bringing
franceline
he
had
established
a
precedent
and
he
was
not
going
to
let
it
drop
franceline
on
the
whole
was
glad
of
the
excitement
she
was
determined
to
use
everything
that
could
help
her
good
resolutions
and
the
necessity
for
seeming
to
enjoy
soon
led
to
her
doing
so
in
reality
after
the
stillness
of
her
little
filled
as
it
was
with
restless
voices
audible
to
no
ear
but
hers
the
gay
stir
of
the
court
was
welcome
it
was
a
pleasurable
sensation
too
to
feel
herself
the
object
of
admiring
attentions
from
a
number
of
agreeable
gentlemen
to
be
deferred
to
and
made
much
of
as
if
she
were
a
little
queen
amongst
them
all
sir
simon
was
more
indulgent
than
ever
and
spoiled
her
to
his
content
father
henwick
who
was
kept
of
what
was
going
on
could
not
find
it
in
his
heart
to
oppose
what
seemed
to
be
an
innocent
diversion
of
her
thoughts
it
was
therefore
anything
but
a
welcome
break
when
lady
anwyll
came
down
one
morning
accompanied
by
sir
simon
to
announce
her
intention
of
carrying
off
her
friend
the
next
day
to
rydal
franceline
fought
off
while
she
could
but
sir
simon
her
excuses
about
not
liking
to
leave
her
father
and
so
forth
was
there
now
to
look
after
him
and
she
must
go
so
she
went
rydal
had
a
dreadful
association
in
her
mind
and
she
shrank
from
going
there
as
from
revisiting
the
scene
of
some
horrible
tragedy
she
shrank
too
from
leaving
her
father
of
late
they
had
been
more
bound
up
in
their
daily
life
than
ever
she
had
coaxed
him
into
accepting
her
services
as
an
amanuensis
and
he
had
quickly
grown
so
used
to
them
that
he
was
sure
to
miss
her
greatly
at
his
work
there
was
nothing
moreover
in
the
inmates
of
rydal
to
compensate
her
for
the
sacrifice
they
were
not
the
least
interesting
it
was
always
the
same
petting
from
lady
anwyll
as
if
she
were
a
kitten
or
a
baby
she
knew
exactly
what
the
conversation
would
be
gossip
about
local
trifles
about
the
family
especially
ponce
his
boots
his
eccentricities
his
pet
dishes
his
pranks
in
the
regiment
the
old
tune
played
over
and
over
again
on
the
same
string
as
to
ponce
himself
franceline
knew
the
big
hussar
already
by
heart
he
would
do
his
best
to
be
entertaining
and
would
only
be
awkward
and
commonplace
nothing
at
rydal
in
fact
rose
above
the
of
dullerton
the
dowager
had
some
few
young
people
in
for
a
in
which
franceline
had
to
take
her
part
and
did
without
any
repugnance
dancing
brought
back
certain
memories
that
pierced
her
like
steel
blades
but
her
heart
was
proof
against
the
thrusts
and
she
defied
them
to
wound
her
lord
roxham
was
invited
and
showed
himself
cordial
and
friendly
but
nothing
more
he
said
he
had
been
called
away
to
london
soon
after
they
last
met
or
else
he
would
have
profited
by
de
la
permission
to
call
at
the
lilies
he
hoped
that
the
authorization
might
still
hold
good
yes
do
come
i
shall
be
so
glad
to
see
you
was
the
frank
and
unaffected
reply
lady
anwyll
had
meantime
felt
rather
aggrieved
at
lord
behavior
her
little
scheme
had
gone
off
so
swimmingly
at
first
she
could
not
understand
why
it
had
suddenly
collapsed
in
its
prosperous
course
and
come
to
a
dead
halt
at
any
rate
she
would
give
him
one
more
chance
the
young
legislator
seemed
in
no
violent
hurry
to
improve
it
he
danced
a
couple
of
times
with
franceline
and
once
with
two
other
young
girls
and
then
subsided
to
dummy
whist
with
the
rector
of
rydal
and
his
wife
leaving
franceline
to
the
combined
fascinations
of
charlton
and
ponce
who
usurped
her
between
them
the
latter
bestowed
such
an
unequal
share
of
a
courtesy
on
the
young
french
girl
indeed
that
his
mother
felt
it
incumbent
on
her
to
explain
to
the
other
young
ladies
that
mlle
de
la
bourbonais
was
a
foreigner
therefore
ponce
being
so
paid
her
particular
attention
and
he
certainly
did
not
only
on
that
occasion
but
while
she
remained
he
was
continually
hovering
about
her
like
a
huge
overshadowing
bird
whose
wings
were
always
in
the
way
of
its
movements
he
tripped
over
footstools
in
attempting
to
place
them
under
her
feet
but
then
he
was
always
so
thankful
that
it
was
himself
not
her
he
nearly
upset
he
spilt
several
cups
of
tea
in
handing
them
to
her
and
was
nearly
overcome
with
gratitude
when
he
saw
the
carpet
had
got
the
contents
and
that
her
pretty
muslin
frock
was
safe
he
hold
an
umbrella
open
over
her
because
it
looked
so
uncommonly
like
rain
and
it
was
such
a
mercy
to
have
only
spoiled
her
bonnet
and
made
a
hole
in
her
veil
when
he
might
so
easily
have
run
the
point
into
her
eye
ponce
like
many
wiser
men
had
endless
satisfaction
in
the
contemplation
of
the
blunders
he
might
have
committed
and
did
not
yet
with
all
his
boyish
awkwardness
franceline
was
growing
very
fond
of
him
he
was
so
thoroughly
and
so
free
from
the
taint
of
conceit
and
then
there
was
an
undeniable
enjoyment
in
the
sense
of
being
cared
for
and
thought
of
and
watched
over
and
it
was
all
done
in
a
naïve
boyish
way
and
with
a
brotherly
absence
of
compliment
or
constraint
that
left
her
free
to
accept
it
without
any
sense
of
undue
obligation
or
the
fear
of
being
called
upon
to
repay
it
except
by
being
pleased
and
grateful
when
he
followed
her
into
the
conservatory
with
a
shawl
and
wrapped
it
round
her
unceremoniously
she
looked
up
at
his
fresh
honest
face
and
said
almost
as
if
he
had
been
a
woman
wish
i
had
you
for
a
brother
captain
anwyll
he
got
very
red
and
was
fumbling
somewhere
in
his
mind
for
an
answer
when
his
mother
called
to
him
for
the
ponce
seized
it
and
dashing
out
a
sudden
upon
the
dress
narrowly
escaped
drenching
but
it
did
escape
what
a
lucky
dog
he
was
how
pleasant
it
was
riding
home
in
the
fresh
afternoon
lady
anwyll
came
in
the
carriage
while
franceline
and
capt
anwyll
cantered
on
before
nothing
was
likely
to
have
happened
at
the
lilies
during
her
absence
but
as
they
drew
near
she
grew
impatient
and
rode
at
a
pace
as
if
she
expected
wonderful
tidings
at
the
end
the
air
was
so
clear
that
dullerton
yet
a
mile
off
sent
its
hum
of
life
towards
the
riders
with
sharp
distinctness
the
panting
of
the
train
as
it
moved
out
of
the
station
sounded
close
by
every
street
cry
and
tinkling
rang
out
like
a
chime
soon
the
soft
cooing
of
the
doves
came
wafted
above
the
distant
voice
of
the
town
and
when
the
travellers
came
within
sight
of
the
lilies
the
flock
flew
to
greet
franceline
wheeling
round
high
up
in
the
air
several
times
before
alighting
on
her
shoulders
and
outstretched
wrist
then
came
her
delighted
exclamation
as
he
hurried
down
the
little
and
affectionate
embrace
and
once
more
the
small
still
that
was
so
sweet
and
so
rich
in
a
restored
joy
recommenced
franceline
devoted
hours
every
day
now
to
working
with
her
father
and
soon
she
became
almost
as
much
absorbed
in
the
work
as
he
was
sometimes
indeed
she
hindered
rather
than
helped
stopping
him
in
the
midst
of
his
dictation
to
demand
an
explanation
but
raymond
never
chided
her
or
grudged
the
delay
her
fresh
young
eyesight
and
diligent
nimble
hand
were
invaluable
to
him
and
he
wondered
how
he
had
got
on
so
long
without
them
lord
roxham
redeemed
his
promise
of
calling
at
the
lilies
he
talked
a
good
deal
to
raymond
about
politics
and
current
events
saying
very
little
to
franceline
who
sat
by
stitching
away
at
some
bit
of
plain
sewing
this
was
just
what
she
liked
her
father
was
entertained
and
interested
a
breeze
from
the
outer
world
always
refreshed
him
though
he
was
hardly
conscious
of
it
still
less
of
needing
any
such
reviving
incident
in
his
quiet
monotonous
existence
but
franceline
always
hailed
it
with
thankfulness
for
him
and
was
well
content
to
remain
in
the
shade
now
while
the
visitor
devoted
himself
to
amusing
her
father
was
it
fancy
or
did
she
on
glancing
up
suddenly
from
her
detect
an
expression
half
compassionate
half
searching
in
lord
face
as
he
looked
fixedly
at
her
whether
it
was
fancy
or
not
her
eyes
fell
at
once
and
the
blood
mantled
her
cheek
she
did
not
venture
to
let
her
gaze
light
on
him
again
and
it
was
with
a
sense
of
shyness
that
she
shook
hands
with
him
at
parting
ponsonby
anwyll
was
now
a
frequent
visitor
at
the
lilies
sometimes
coming
alone
sometimes
with
sir
simon
and
it
was
a
curious
coincidence
if
quite
accidental
that
he
generally
made
his
appearance
as
franceline
was
on
the
point
of
starting
for
her
ride
and
as
he
was
always
on
horseback
there
was
no
conceivable
reason
why
he
should
not
join
the
party
the
burly
hussar
was
a
safer
companion
in
the
saddle
than
in
the
he
rode
with
the
masterly
ease
of
a
cavalryman
and
the
road
being
free
from
the
disturbing
influence
of
and
chairs
he
spilt
nothing
and
upset
nobody
and
franceline
was
always
glad
of
his
company
she
was
too
inexperienced
and
too
much
absorbed
in
other
thoughts
to
forecast
any
possible
results
from
this
state
of
things
ponsonby
continued
the
same
familiar
kind
manner
to
her
was
mightily
concerned
in
keeping
her
out
of
the
bad
bits
of
road
and
out
of
the
way
of
the
cattle
that
might
be
tramping
to
market
and
prove
offensive
to
her
mettlesome
pony
he
never
aimed
at
making
himself
agreeable
only
useful
but
the
eyes
of
dullerton
looked
on
at
all
this
brotherly
attention
and
drew
its
own
conclusion
the
langrove
young
ladies
of
whom
somehow
she
had
of
late
seen
less
than
ever
grew
excited
to
the
highest
pitch
about
it
and
were
already
discussing
how
many
of
them
would
be
bridemaids
at
the
wedding
if
bridemaids
there
were
most
likely
sir
simon
would
settle
that
and
probably
give
the
dresses
even
discreet
miss
merrywig
could
not
forbear
shaking
her
finger
and
her
barrel
curls
at
franceline
one
day
when
the
latter
hurried
off
to
get
ready
for
her
ride
with
the
excuse
that
sir
simon
and
capt
anwyll
were
due
at
three
but
franceline
knew
by
this
time
what
dullerton
was
and
what
it
could
achieve
in
the
way
of
gossip
spinning
a
yarn
a
mile
long
out
of
a
thread
the
length
of
your
finger
she
only
laughed
and
mentally
remarked
how
little
people
knew
they
would
be
marrying
her
to
sir
simon
next
when
ponsonby
rejoined
his
regiment
and
was
seen
no
more
at
her
the
three
had
set
out
for
a
ride
one
afternoon
when
as
they
were
dashing
along
at
full
tilt
sir
simon
pulled
up
with
a
strong
formula
of
exclamation
the
matter
cried
sir
ponsonby
plunging
back
heavily
while
franceline
reined
in
rosebud
and
turned
in
some
alarm
to
see
what
had
occurred
i
have
not
actually
forgotten
all
about
simpson
who
comes
down
from
london
by
appointment
this
afternoon
i
dare
say
waiting
for
me
by
this
and
he
must
return
by
the
i
must
leave
you
and
post
home
as
quick
as
nero
will
carry
and
with
a
to
franceline
and
a
nod
to
capt
anwyll
coupled
with
an
injunction
not
to
let
her
ride
too
fast
and
to
keep
her
out
of
mischief
the
baronet
turned
his
head
and
galloped
away
desiring
the
groom
to
follow
on
with
the
others
they
went
on
at
a
good
pace
until
they
reached
the
foot
of
a
gentle
ascent
when
both
of
one
accord
fell
into
a
walk
for
the
first
time
in
their
intercourse
franceline
was
conscious
of
a
certain
vague
awkwardness
with
capt
anwyll
of
casting
about
for
something
to
say
and
not
finding
anything
the
place
was
perfectly
solitary
the
woods
on
one
side
the
fields
sloping
down
to
the
river
on
the
other
the
groom
lagged
respectfully
a
long
way
behind
quite
out
of
often
out
of
sight
for
the
road
curved
and
wheeled
abruptly
every
now
and
then
and
hid
the
foremost
riders
from
his
view
ponsonby
broke
the
silence
he
would
call
her
miss
franceline
because
it
was
easier
and
shorter
have
something
on
my
mind
that
i
want
badly
to
say
to
you
been
wanting
to
say
it
for
some
time
i
hope
it
make
you
angry
say
till
i
hear
it
but
if
you
are
in
doubt
about
it
perhaps
it
would
be
safer
not
to
say
it
remarked
franceline
beginning
to
tremble
ominously
vex
you
for
anything
in
the
world
my
honor
i
protested
ponce
warmly
you
see
i
know
whether
what
going
to
say
will
vex
you
or
say
it
you
are
sure
not
to
vex
me
then
was
the
encouraging
advice
and
she
devoutly
hoped
he
would
take
it
but
he
was
not
so
minded
true
he
assented
then
you
see
it
might
please
you
half
afraid
it
though
only
i
be
sure
till
i
after
musing
a
moment
in
obvious
perplexity
he
resumed
speaking
rapidly
as
if
he
had
made
up
his
mind
to
bolt
it
all
out
and
take
the
consequences
not
a
puppy
my
worst
enemy
accuse
me
of
that
but
not
a
bad
fellow
either
as
my
mother
and
all
the
fellows
in
the
tenth
will
tell
you
and
the
fact
is
grown
very
fond
of
you
miss
franceline
and
if
take
me
as
i
am
do
my
best
to
be
a
good
husband
to
you
and
to
make
you
he
said
it
quickly
as
if
he
were
reciting
a
lesson
got
by
heart
and
then
came
to
a
dead
halt
and
for
a
he
might
have
paused
long
enough
if
he
had
not
at
last
turned
round
and
read
his
fate
in
scared
white
face
and
undisguised
agitation
now
say
no
before
you
think
it
over
entreated
the
young
man
know
ten
times
too
good
for
me
but
for
that
matter
too
good
for
the
best
fellow
that
ever
lived
i
said
so
myself
to
sir
simon
only
this
morning
but
i
do
love
you
with
all
my
heart
franceline
and
if
only
you
could
care
for
me
ever
so
little
to
begin
with
be
satisfied
and
make
me
the
happiest
man
alive
franceline
had
now
recovered
her
and
was
able
to
speak
though
she
still
trembled
am
so
sorry
she
exclaimed
never
dreamed
of
this
indeed
i
did
not
i
dare
say
i
have
been
very
selfish
very
thoughtless
but
it
was
not
wilful
i
am
very
unhappy
to
have
given
you
pain
say
that
make
me
miserable
if
you
say
that
pleaded
ponsonby
course
you
never
thought
of
it
great
impudence
of
me
to
think
of
it
i
have
so
little
to
offer
you
but
if
you
quite
hate
the
sight
of
me
sure
i
could
make
you
a
devoted
husband
and
love
you
better
than
many
a
cleverer
fellow
been
fond
of
you
from
the
first
and
so
has
my
are
both
very
good
to
me
i
am
very
very
grateful
the
tears
rose
to
her
eyes
and
with
a
frank
impulsive
movement
she
held
out
her
hand
to
him
ponsonby
bent
from
the
saddle
and
raised
it
to
his
lips
although
it
was
gloved
if
he
had
not
been
at
heart
and
a
trifle
stupid
poor
fellow
he
would
have
felt
that
it
was
all
over
with
him
the
little
hand
lay
with
cold
sisterly
kindness
in
his
grasp
and
franceline
looked
at
him
with
eyes
that
were
too
kind
and
pitying
to
promise
anything
more
than
sisterly
pity
and
gratitude
can
not
i
can
not
you
must
never
think
of
it
any
more
do
you
not
see
that
it
is
impossible
i
am
a
catholic
as
if
that
mattered
a
whit
i
mean
as
if
it
need
make
any
difference
between
us
i
mind
it
a
pin
my
honor
i
i
said
so
to
the
count
settled
all
that
in
fact
and
if
satisfied
to
trust
me
why
will
not
you
you
have
spoken
to
my
father
yes
that
was
the
right
thing
sir
simon
told
me
as
he
was
a
what
did
he
say
to
you
said
that
if
you
said
yes
he
was
quite
willing
to
give
you
to
me
i
wanted
to
come
to
settlements
at
once
i
only
wish
i
was
ten
times
better
off
but
he
would
not
hear
a
word
about
that
until
i
had
consulted
you
only
he
said
he
would
be
glad
to
receive
me
as
his
son
he
did
indeed
franceline
she
was
looking
straight
before
her
her
eyes
dilated
her
whole
face
aglow
with
some
strong
emotion
that
his
words
seemed
to
have
stirred
in
her
remember
continued
ponsonby
you
said
to
me
once
you
would
like
to
have
me
for
a
brother
well
it
will
be
nearly
the
same
thing
you
would
get
used
to
me
as
a
husband
after
a
while
you
would
franceline
never
never
she
repeated
not
passionately
but
with
a
calm
emphasis
that
made
heart
die
within
him
he
could
not
find
a
word
to
oppose
to
the
strong
quiet
protest
it
is
all
a
mistake
said
franceline
know
who
is
to
blame
i
suppose
i
am
i
should
not
have
let
you
come
so
often
but
you
were
so
kind
and
i
have
so
few
people
to
care
for
me
and
when
one
is
sad
at
heart
kindness
is
so
welcome
but
i
should
have
thought
of
you
i
have
been
selfish
no
you
have
not
been
selfish
at
all
all
my
doing
and
my
fault
affirmed
the
young
man
wish
i
had
held
my
tongue
a
little
longer
my
mother
will
come
and
see
you
she
will
explain
it
all
and
how
it
make
any
trouble
to
you
my
being
a
must
not
come
said
franceline
with
decision
is
nothing
to
explain
i
am
sincerely
grateful
to
her
and
to
you
but
i
have
only
gratitude
to
give
you
i
hope
with
all
my
heart
that
you
may
soon
forget
me
and
any
pain
i
am
causing
you
and
that
you
may
meet
with
a
wife
who
will
make
you
happier
than
i
could
have
ponsonby
was
silent
for
a
few
moments
and
then
he
said
speaking
with
a
certain
hesitation
and
diffidence
could
be
satisfied
to
wait
and
to
go
on
hoping
if
i
were
sure
of
one
thing
that
you
did
not
care
for
anybody
else
do
you
she
flashed
a
glance
of
indignant
pride
at
him
right
have
you
to
put
such
a
question
to
me
i
tell
you
i
do
not
care
for
you
and
that
i
will
never
marry
you
you
have
no
right
to
ask
me
any
ponsonby
recoiled
as
if
a
flash
of
lightning
had
forked
out
of
the
cold
gray
sky
heavens
i
did
not
mean
to
offend
you
i
declare
solemnly
i
did
not
but
he
had
touched
a
vibrating
chord
unawares
and
set
every
fibre
in
her
heart
thrilling
and
every
pulse
throbbing
and
the
disturbance
was
not
to
be
laid
by
any
words
that
he
could
utter
franceline
turned
homewards
and
they
did
not
exchange
a
word
until
they
reached
the
lilies
and
ponsonby
was
assisting
her
to
alight
you
forgive
me
he
said
speaking
very
low
and
penitently
she
had
already
forgiven
him
but
not
herself
do
and
i
am
sorry
for
being
so
impetuous
my
mother
may
come
and
see
you
no
it
is
no
use
it
is
no
use
i
say
again
i
wish
you
were
my
brother
sir
ponsonby
but
as
you
care
to
remain
my
friend
never
speak
to
me
again
of
he
pressed
the
hand
she
held
out
to
him
the
groom
backed
up
to
take
the
reins
of
her
horse
and
ponsonby
rode
away
with
a
thorn
in
his
honest
heart
miss
merrywig
was
within
chatting
and
laughing
away
with
the
count
franceline
was
not
in
a
mood
to
meet
the
garrulous
old
lady
or
anybody
so
she
went
straight
to
her
room
and
only
came
down
when
the
visitor
was
gone
she
said
going
up
behind
him
and
laying
a
hand
on
each
shoulder
is
this
sir
ponsonby
tells
me
that
you
are
tired
of
your
and
want
to
get
rid
of
her
de
la
bourbonais
drew
down
the
two
trembling
hands
and
clasped
them
on
his
breast
and
lifted
his
head
as
if
he
would
look
at
her
would
not
be
losing
her
but
gaining
a
son
who
would
take
care
of
her
when
i
am
gone
she
has
not
thought
of
that
and
she
does
not
wish
to
think
of
it
i
will
live
with
you
while
i
live
i
care
to
look
beyond
that
nor
must
you
petit
père
but
i
am
very
sorry
for
sir
ponsonby
you
must
write
and
tell
him
so
and
that
he
must
not
come
any
more
until
he
has
forgotten
me
that
you
can
not
give
me
cherished
one
let
us
talk
about
this
matter
it
is
very
serious
we
must
not
do
anything
he
tried
to
unclasp
her
hands
and
draw
her
to
his
side
but
she
locked
them
tighter
and
laid
her
cheek
on
his
head
père
there
is
nothing
to
talk
about
i
will
never
marry
him
or
anybody
child
thou
speakest
without
reflection
captain
anwyll
is
a
good
honorable
man
and
he
loves
thee
and
it
would
be
a
great
comfort
to
me
to
see
thee
married
to
him
and
not
to
leave
thee
friendless
and
almost
penniless
whenever
god
calls
me
away
i
understand
it
has
taken
thee
by
surprise
and
that
thou
canst
not
accept
the
idea
without
some
delay
and
getting
used
to
it
but
we
must
not
decide
so
important
a
matter
hastily
come
sit
down
and
let
us
discuss
father
she
answered
in
a
tone
of
determination
that
was
quite
foreign
to
her
now
and
reminded
him
of
the
wilful
child
of
long
ago
is
no
use
in
discussing
what
is
already
decided
i
will
never
marry
ponsonby
or
anybody
why
petit
père
do
you
forget
that
he
is
a
protestant
i
have
forgotten
nothing
that
has
been
all
arranged
he
is
most
liberal
about
it
consents
to
leave
you
to
to
have
everything
your
own
way
in
that
respect
and
assures
me
that
it
shall
make
no
difference
whatever
to
you
his
not
being
of
your
difference
father
no
difference
to
a
wife
that
her
husband
should
be
a
heretic
you
can
not
be
in
earnest
what
blessing
could
there
be
on
such
a
marriage
you
would
soon
convert
him
my
little
one
you
would
make
a
good
catholic
of
him
before
the
year
was
out
said
de
la
bourbonais
of
that
suppose
it
were
the
other
way
and
that
he
made
a
good
protestant
of
me
it
is
no
more
than
i
should
deserve
for
my
presumption
you
know
what
happens
to
those
who
seek
the
that
is
a
different
thing
that
warning
applies
to
those
who
seek
it
rashly
from
vain
or
selfish
motives
protested
raymond
moving
his
spectacles
as
he
always
did
instinctively
when
his
argument
was
weak
and
he
knew
right
well
that
now
it
was
slipping
into
sophistry
can
not
see
anything
but
a
selfish
motive
in
marrying
against
the
express
prohibition
of
the
church
and
without
any
affection
for
the
person
but
simply
because
he
could
give
you
a
position
and
the
good
things
of
this
life
said
franceline
prohibition
is
conditional
persisted
raymond
those
conditions
would
be
scrupulously
fulfilled
and
as
to
there
not
being
the
necessary
affection
there
is
enough
on
his
side
for
both
and
his
love
would
soon
beget
it
is
no
use
i
am
grieved
to
contradict
you
but
i
can
not
can
not
do
this
to
please
you
you
must
write
and
say
so
to
capt
anwyll
you
must
raymond
heaved
a
sigh
he
felt
as
powerless
as
an
infant
before
this
new
wilfulness
of
his
it
was
foolish
as
well
as
imprudent
to
yield
but
he
did
not
know
how
to
deal
with
it
there
was
honest
truth
on
her
side
no
subterfuges
could
baffle
the
instinctive
logic
of
her
childlike
faith
will
let
things
remain
as
they
are
for
a
few
days
and
then
if
thou
dost
still
insist
i
will
write
and
refuse
the
offer
he
said
seeking
a
last
chance
in
temporizing
petit
père
if
you
love
me
write
at
once
it
is
only
fair
to
sir
ponsonby
and
it
will
set
my
mind
at
rest
here
let
me
find
you
a
pen
she
chose
one
out
of
a
number
of
inky
on
the
little
japan
tray
and
thrust
it
playfully
between
his
fingers
the
letter
was
written
and
angélique
was
forthwith
despatched
with
it
to
the
pillar
at
the
park
gate
during
the
remainder
of
the
afternoon
franceline
worked
away
diligently
at
the
causes
of
the
french
revolution
and
spent
the
evening
reading
aloud
but
de
la
bourbonais
could
not
so
lightly
dismiss
the
incident
from
his
thoughts
he
had
experienced
a
moment
of
pure
joy
and
unutterable
thankfulness
when
ponsonby
had
come
in
and
stammered
out
his
honest
confession
of
love
and
pleaded
so
humbly
with
the
father
to
his
part
with
miss
the
pleasure
was
all
the
greater
for
being
a
complete
surprise
sir
simon
had
cautiously
resolved
to
have
no
hand
in
negotiating
between
the
parties
he
had
let
things
take
their
course
from
the
first
determined
not
to
interfere
but
clearly
foreseeing
the
issue
raymond
was
bewildered
by
rejection
of
the
proposed
marriage
he
did
not
try
much
to
explain
it
to
himself
it
was
a
puzzle
that
did
not
come
within
the
rule
and
compass
of
his
philosophy
a
young
girl
refusing
to
be
married
when
an
eligible
husband
presented
himself
for
her
acceptance
he
heaved
many
a
deep
sigh
over
it
as
his
anxious
gaze
rested
on
the
young
head
bent
over
the
desk
but
he
did
not
ask
any
questions
sir
simon
came
down
next
morning
in
high
displeasure
he
was
angry
disappointed
aggrieved
here
he
had
been
at
considerable
pains
of
ingenuity
and
forethought
to
provide
a
model
husband
for
franceline
a
young
fellow
whom
any
girl
ought
to
jump
at
unencumbered
and
the
little
minx
turns
up
her
nose
at
him
and
sends
him
to
the
such
perverseness
and
folly
were
not
to
be
tolerated
what
did
she
mean
by
it
what
did
she
see
amiss
in
anwyll
sir
simon
was
for
having
her
up
for
a
round
lecture
but
raymond
would
not
allow
this
he
might
groan
in
his
inmost
heart
over
refusal
but
he
was
not
going
to
let
her
be
bullied
by
anybody
not
even
by
sir
simon
he
stood
up
for
his
child
and
defended
her
as
if
he
had
fully
approved
of
her
conduct
tell
you
what
it
is
bourbonais
just
as
great
a
fool
as
she
is
only
she
is
a
child
and
knows
nothing
of
life
and
see
the
madness
of
what
she
is
doing
but
you
ought
to
know
better
i
have
no
patience
with
you
when
one
thinks
of
what
this
marriage
would
do
for
both
of
you
lifting
you
out
of
penury
restoring
your
daughter
to
her
proper
position
in
the
world
and
securing
her
future
so
that
if
you
were
called
away
you
need
have
no
care
or
anxiety
about
her
and
to
think
of
your
backing
her
up
in
rejecting
it
all
did
not
back
her
up
in
it
i
deplore
her
having
done
so
replied
raymond
i
will
not
coerce
her
her
happiness
is
dearer
to
me
than
her
interest
or
my
tomfoolery
as
if
her
interest
and
her
happiness
were
not
identical
in
this
case
a
man
who
is
fond
of
her
and
rich
enough
to
give
her
everything
in
life
a
girl
could
wish
for
what
does
she
want
besides
demanded
sir
simon
angrily
believe
she
wants
nothing
except
to
be
left
with
her
old
father
she
does
not
care
for
capt
anwyll
said
raymond
but
his
french
mind
felt
this
was
very
weak
argument
devil
she
who
does
she
care
for
retorted
the
baronet
but
he
had
no
sooner
uttered
the
words
than
he
regretted
them
they
seemed
to
recoil
on
him
like
a
stone
flung
too
near
he
seized
his
hat
and
muttering
impatiently
something
about
the
nonsense
of
giving
into
childish
fancies
strode
out
of
the
cottage
and
did
not
show
himself
there
for
several
days
he
was
pursued
by
that
question
of
his
own
did
franceline
care
for
and
made
uncomfortable
by
the
persistency
with
which
it
kept
dinning
in
his
ears
he
had
made
up
his
mind
long
ago
that
the
failure
of
his
first
matrimonial
plot
had
had
no
serious
effect
on
her
heart
or
spirits
she
was
looking
very
delicate
when
he
came
back
but
that
was
the
dulness
of
the
life
she
had
been
leading
during
his
absence
she
had
picked
up
considerably
since
then
it
was
plain
to
everybody
she
had
her
spirits
were
better
there
was
certainly
nothing
wrong
in
that
direction
how
could
there
be
when
he
sir
simon
so
thoroughly
desired
the
contrary
and
did
so
much
to
cheer
up
the
child
and
himself
into
the
bargain
and
make
her
forget
any
impression
that
unlucky
clide
might
have
made
still
no
matter
how
emphatically
he
answered
it
the
tiresome
question
kept
sounding
in
his
ears
day
after
day
he
could
stand
it
no
longer
he
must
go
and
see
them
at
the
lilies
see
franceline
and
read
on
her
innocent
young
face
that
all
was
peace
within
and
cheer
up
his
own
depressed
spirits
by
a
talk
with
raymond
nobody
listened
to
him
and
sympathized
with
him
as
raymond
did
he
had
no
worries
of
his
own
to
distract
him
for
one
thing
and
if
he
had
he
was
such
a
philosophical
being
he
would
carry
them
to
the
moon
and
leave
them
there
sir
simon
was
blessed
with
no
such
happy
faculty
he
could
forget
his
troubles
for
a
while
under
the
stimulating
balm
of
cheerful
society
and
generous
wine
but
as
soon
as
he
was
alone
they
were
down
on
him
like
an
army
of
ants
stinging
and
goading
him
things
were
very
gloomy
just
now
and
he
could
less
than
ever
dispense
with
the
opiate
of
sympathetic
companionship
lady
rebecca
had
taken
a
fresh
start
and
was
less
likely
to
depart
than
she
had
been
for
the
last
ten
years
the
duns
who
watched
her
fluctuations
between
life
and
death
with
almost
as
sincere
and
breathless
an
interest
as
her
heir
had
got
wind
of
this
and
were
up
and
at
him
again
hunting
him
like
a
hare
the
low
grasping
insolent
hounds
his
revived
money
annoyances
made
him
the
more
irascible
with
franceline
for
throwing
away
her
chance
of
being
for
ever
saved
and
protected
from
the
like
but
he
would
harp
no
more
on
that
string
he
had
been
into
dullerton
on
horseback
and
overtaking
the
postman
on
his
way
home
he
stopped
to
take
his
letters
and
then
asked
if
there
were
any
for
the
lilies
he
was
going
there
and
would
save
the
postman
the
walk
that
far
you
sir
there
is
one
for
the
and
the
man
held
up
a
large
blue
envelope
like
a
letter
which
sir
simon
thrust
into
his
pocket
he
left
his
horse
at
the
court
and
walked
on
through
the
park
reading
his
letters
as
he
went
their
contents
were
not
of
the
most
agreeable
to
judge
by
the
peevish
and
angry
ejaculations
that
the
reader
emitted
in
the
course
of
their
perusal
he
had
not
done
when
he
reached
the
cottage
a
letter
for
you
bourbonais
finish
mine
while
reading
he
handed
the
blue
envelope
to
his
friend
and
flinging
himself
into
a
chair
became
again
absorbed
and
ejaculatory
de
la
bourbonais
meanwhile
proceeded
to
open
his
communication
he
surveyed
it
with
uplifted
eyebrows
examined
well
the
large
red
seal
and
scrutinized
the
handwriting
of
the
address
before
he
tore
it
open
his
eye
ran
quickly
over
the
page
a
nervous
twitch
contracted
his
features
his
hand
shook
as
if
a
string
at
his
elbow
had
been
rudely
pulled
but
he
controlled
all
further
sign
of
emotion
and
after
reading
the
contents
twice
over
silently
folded
the
letter
and
replaced
it
in
the
envelope
sir
simon
had
seen
nothing
he
was
deep
in
suppressed
denunciations
of
some
rascally
dun
me
if
i
know
to
be
the
end
of
it
or
the
end
of
me
an
ounce
of
lead
in
my
skull
most
likely
he
burst
out
ramming
the
bundle
of
offending
documents
into
his
brutes
are
in
league
to
drive
me
mad
anything
new
happened
inquired
the
count
anxiously
hoped
things
had
arranged
themselves
of
late
they
how
can
they
when
these
vampires
are
sucking
the
blood
of
one
pretty
much
like
sucking
a
corpse
he
laughed
sardonically
fools
if
they
would
but
have
sense
to
see
that
it
is
their
own
interest
not
to
drive
me
to
desperation
but
they
will
goad
me
to
do
something
that
will
make
an
end
of
their
chance
of
ever
being
paid
de
la
bourbonais
ought
to
have
been
hardened
to
this
sort
of
thing
but
he
was
not
the
vague
threats
and
dark
innuendoes
always
alarmed
him
he
never
knew
but
that
each
crisis
which
called
them
out
might
be
the
supreme
one
that
would
bring
about
their
fulfilment
at
such
moments
he
had
not
the
heart
to
rebuke
sir
simon
and
add
the
bitterness
of
to
his
excited
feelings
his
look
of
keen
distress
struck
sir
simon
with
compunction
it
will
blow
off
as
it
has
done
so
often
before
i
suppose
he
said
tossing
his
head
a
letter
from
l
to
say
he
is
coming
down
next
week
with
a
whole
houseful
of
men
to
shoot
not
seen
l
for
an
age
a
delightful
fellow
cheer
one
and
the
baronet
heaved
a
sigh
from
the
very
depths
of
his
afflicted
spirit
cher
is
it
wise
to
be
asking
down
crowds
of
people
in
this
way
asked
raymond
dubiously
did
not
ask
them
i
tell
you
they
have
written
to
invite
themselves
it
was
true
but
sir
simon
forgot
how
often
he
had
besought
his
friends
to
do
just
what
they
were
now
doing
to
write
and
say
when
they
could
come
and
to
bring
as
many
as
they
liked
with
them
that
had
always
been
the
way
at
the
court
and
he
was
not
the
man
to
belie
its
old
traditions
but
raymond
who
had
also
his
class
of
noble
traditions
could
not
see
it
not
write
frankly
and
without
explaining
the
precise
motive
say
that
you
can
not
at
present
receive
any
one
sir
simon
gave
an
impatient
pshaw
my
dear
bourbonais
nonsense
as
if
a
few
fellows
more
or
less
signified
snapping
his
fingers
the
end
of
the
year
besides
what
the
deuce
is
the
good
of
having
a
place
at
all
if
one
have
friends
about
one
in
it
better
shut
up
at
once
the
only
compensation
a
man
has
the
only
thing
that
pulls
him
through
and
then
the
pheasants
are
there
and
must
be
shot
i
shoot
them
all
but
no
use
trying
to
make
you
take
an
view
of
the
case
you
simply
do
de
la
bourbonais
agreed
and
inwardly
hoped
he
never
might
come
to
see
the
case
as
his
friend
did
but
notwithstanding
this
sir
simon
went
on
discussing
his
own
misfortunes
denouncing
the
rascality
and
rapacity
of
the
modern
tradesman
and
bemoaning
the
good
old
times
when
the
world
was
a
fit
place
for
a
gentleman
to
live
in
when
he
had
sufficiently
relieved
his
mind
on
the
subject
and
drew
breath
de
la
bourbonais
poured
what
oil
of
comfort
he
could
on
his
wounds
he
spoke
confidently
of
the
ultimate
demise
of
lady
rebecca
and
expressed
equal
trust
in
the
powers
of
simpson
to
perform
once
again
the
meteorological
feat
known
to
sir
simon
as
the
under
the
influence
of
these
soothing
abstractions
the
baronet
cheered
up
and
before
long
richard
was
himself
again
he
overhauled
latest
work
read
aloud
some
notes
on
mirabeau
which
franceline
had
taken
down
at
his
dictation
the
previous
evening
and
worked
himself
into
a
frenzy
of
indignation
at
the
partiality
for
that
thundering
demagogue
raymond
waxed
warm
in
defence
of
his
hero
maintained
that
at
heart
mirabeau
had
wished
to
save
the
king
and
almost
lost
his
philosophical
when
sir
simon
called
him
the
of
the
revolution
a
traitor
and
a
bully
and
other
hard
names
to
the
same
effect
wash
my
hands
of
you
if
you
are
going
to
play
panegyrist
to
that
ruffian
was
the
concluding
remark
and
he
flung
out
his
hands
as
if
he
were
shaking
the
contamination
from
his
fingers
suddenly
his
eye
fell
upon
the
great
blue
letter
and
abruptly
dismissing
mirabeau
he
said
the
way
what
a
formidable
document
that
is
that
i
brought
you
just
now
has
it
anything
to
do
with
the
revolution
raymond
shook
his
head
and
smothered
a
rising
sigh
has
been
as
good
as
a
revolution
to
me
at
any
dear
bourbonais
what
is
it
nothing
seriously
amiss
i
hope
exclaimed
sir
simon
full
of
alarmed
interest
the
count
took
up
the
letter
and
handed
it
to
him
heavens
bankrupt
can
pay
nothing
how
much
had
you
in
it
two
hundred
the
savings
of
the
last
fourteen
years
replied
de
la
bourbonais
calmly
dear
fellow
heartily
sorry
exclaimed
his
friend
in
an
accent
of
sincere
distress
all
my
heart
sorry
and
to
think
of
you
having
read
this
and
said
nothing
and
i
raving
away
about
my
own
troubles
like
a
selfish
dog
as
i
am
why
did
you
not
tell
me
at
once
good
would
it
have
done
raymond
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
with
another
involuntary
sigh
threw
the
letter
on
the
table
hard
though
i
was
so
little
prepared
for
it
the
house
bore
such
a
good
should
have
said
it
was
the
safest
bank
in
the
country
so
it
was
very
likely
only
one
did
not
reckon
with
the
dishonesty
of
this
scheming
villain
of
a
partner
if
it
be
true
that
he
is
the
cause
of
doubt
it
is
why
should
they
tell
lies
about
it
the
whole
affair
will
be
in
the
papers
one
of
these
days
i
you
can
stand
there
and
not
curse
the
villain
good
would
cursing
him
do
it
would
not
bring
back
my
poor
raymond
laughed
gently
dare
say
his
own
conscience
will
curse
him
before
long
the
unhappy
man
but
who
knows
what
terrible
temptation
may
have
driven
him
to
the
deed
perhaps
he
got
into
some
difficulty
that
nothing
else
could
extricate
him
from
and
he
may
have
had
a
wife
and
children
pulling
at
his
conscience
by
his
libera
nos
a
malo
domine
and
looking
upwards
raymond
sighed
again
a
strange
being
you
are
raymond
exclaimed
sir
simon
eyeing
him
curiously
i
believe
your
philosophy
is
worth
something
after
de
la
bourbonais
laughed
outright
worth
nearly
the
money
to
have
brought
you
to
that
see
you
stand
there
coolly
and
philosophize
about
the
motives
that
may
possibly
have
led
an
unprincipled
scoundrel
to
rob
you
of
every
penny
you
possessed
many
a
man
has
got
a
fit
from
a
fool
perhaps
but
it
would
be
a
poor
sort
of
man
that
such
a
blow
would
send
into
a
fit
returned
the
count
with
mild
contempt
i
must
not
be
forgetful
of
the
difference
of
conditions
he
added
quickly
all
depends
on
what
the
money
is
worth
to
one
and
what
its
loss
involves
i
want
it
at
present
it
was
a
little
hoard
for
the
rainy
day
and
qui
sait
the
rainy
day
may
never
come
franceline
may
marry
a
rich
man
suggested
the
baronet
not
with
any
intent
to
wound
so
i
may
never
want
the
money
and
so
never
be
the
poorer
for
losing
supposing
there
was
at
this
moment
some
pressing
necessity
for
it
that
your
child
was
in
absolute
need
of
it
for
some
reason
or
other
what
then
queried
sir
simon
raymond
winced
and
started
imperceptibly
as
if
a
pain
went
through
him
heaven
there
is
no
necessity
to
answer
that
he
said
were
taught
to
pray
to
be
delivered
from
temptation
let
us
be
thankful
when
we
are
and
not
set
imaginary
traps
for
men
are
i
believe
born
proof
against
temptation
i
should
say
you
are
one
of
them
bourbonais
said
his
friend
looking
steadily
at
him
are
mistaken
replied
raymond
quietly
know
whether
any
human
being
may
be
born
with
that
sort
of
covering
but
i
know
for
certain
that
i
was
you
then
conceive
yourself
under
a
pressure
of
temptation
so
strong
as
that
your
principles
your
conscience
would
give
way
can
you
imagine
yourself
telling
a
deliberate
lie
for
instance
or
doing
a
deliberate
wrong
to
some
one
in
order
to
save
yourself
or
better
your
child
from
some
grievous
harm
raymond
thought
for
a
moment
as
if
he
were
poising
a
balance
in
his
mind
before
he
answered
then
he
said
speaking
with
slow
emphasis
as
if
every
word
was
being
weighed
in
the
scales
i
can
fancy
myself
giving
way
if
at
such
a
crisis
as
you
describe
i
were
left
to
myself
with
only
my
own
strength
to
lean
on
but
i
hope
i
should
not
be
left
to
it
i
hope
i
should
ask
to
be
delivered
from
the
humility
of
the
avowal
went
further
to
deepen
sir
faith
in
his
integrity
and
in
the
strength
of
his
principles
than
the
boldest
could
have
done
it
informed
him
too
of
the
existence
of
a
certain
ingredient
in
philosophy
which
the
careless
and
man
of
the
world
had
not
till
then
suspected
thing
i
know
he
said
taking
up
his
hat
and
extending
a
hand
to
de
la
bourbonais
your
conscience
were
ever
to
play
you
false
it
would
make
an
end
of
my
faith
in
all
mankind
and
in
something
to
be
continued
questions
concerning
the
syllabus
doctrinal
authority
of
the
syllabus
from
les
etudes
religieuses
etc
we
enter
on
a
work
whose
practical
usefulness
no
one
we
suspect
will
dispute
since
it
concerns
perhaps
the
most
memorable
act
of
the
reign
of
pius
the
syllabus
there
has
been
a
great
deal
of
discussion
about
the
syllabus
much
has
been
written
on
it
in
the
way
both
of
attack
and
defence
but
it
is
remarkable
that
it
has
scarcely
been
studied
at
all
the
remark
was
made
by
one
of
the
editors
of
this
review
father
marquigny
in
the
general
congress
of
catholic
committees
at
paris
and
so
true
was
it
felt
to
be
that
it
provoked
the
approving
laughter
of
the
whole
assembly
but
to
pass
by
those
who
busy
themselves
about
this
document
without
having
read
it
how
many
are
there
even
among
catholics
who
after
having
read
it
have
only
the
most
vague
and
confused
notions
about
it
how
many
who
if
they
were
asked
does
the
syllabus
teach
you
what
does
it
make
obligatory
on
you
would
not
know
what
to
answer
thus
is
man
constituted
he
skims
willingly
over
the
surface
of
things
but
he
has
no
fancy
for
stopping
awhile
and
digging
underneath
if
he
is
pleased
with
looking
at
a
great
many
things
he
does
not
equally
concern
himself
to
gain
knowledge
because
there
is
no
true
science
without
labor
and
labor
is
troublesome
yet
nothing
could
be
more
desirable
for
him
than
to
come
by
this
luminous
entrance
from
the
knowledge
to
the
possession
of
truth
christian
faith
when
it
is
living
and
active
necessarily
experiences
the
desire
of
it
for
according
to
the
beautiful
saying
of
anselm
it
is
by
its
very
nature
a
seeker
of
science
of
knowing
quærens
but
not
to
delay
ourselves
by
these
considerations
is
it
possible
to
exaggerate
the
importance
of
the
study
of
the
syllabus
in
the
critical
circumstances
in
which
we
are
placed
the
uncertainty
of
the
future
the
impossibility
of
discovering
a
satisfactory
course
in
the
midst
of
the
shadows
which
surround
us
the
need
of
knowing
what
to
seize
a
firm
hold
of
in
the
formidable
problems
whose
obscurity
agitates
in
these
days
the
strongest
minds
above
all
the
furious
assaults
of
the
enemies
of
the
church
and
the
authority
belonging
to
a
solemn
admonition
coming
to
us
from
the
chair
of
truth
all
these
things
teach
us
plainly
enough
how
culpable
it
must
be
for
us
to
remain
indifferent
and
to
neglect
the
illumination
offered
to
us
the
teachings
of
the
vicar
of
jesus
christ
deserve
to
be
meditated
on
at
leisure
it
is
this
which
inspires
us
with
a
hope
that
our
work
will
be
favorably
received
truth
moreover
claims
the
services
of
all
even
of
the
feeblest
and
we
must
not
desert
her
cause
for
fear
our
ability
may
not
suffice
for
her
defence
certainly
no
one
will
expect
us
here
to
give
an
analytical
exposition
of
the
eighty
propositions
condemned
by
pius
ix
several
numbers
of
the
would
scarcely
suffice
for
that
general
questions
dominate
all
others
it
is
to
the
careful
solution
of
these
that
we
shall
devote
ourselves
they
have
always
appeared
to
us
to
need
clear
and
decisive
explanation
often
they
are
incorrectly
proposed
oftener
still
they
are
the
object
of
our
efforts
will
be
to
point
out
with
precision
the
limits
within
which
they
must
be
restrained
the
sense
in
which
they
must
be
accepted
and
their
necessary
import
then
to
give
them
as
clearly
as
we
are
able
a
solution
the
most
sure
and
the
most
conformable
to
first
principles
if
it
should
be
objected
that
in
this
we
are
entering
on
a
wide
theological
field
we
shall
not
deny
it
proudhon
who
desired
anarchy
in
things
in
principles
everywhere
in
fact
except
in
reasoning
averred
that
rigorous
syllogism
lands
us
inevitably
at
theology
how
then
would
it
be
possible
not
to
find
it
in
the
syllabus
they
on
the
other
hand
who
are
unceasing
in
their
violent
attacks
on
this
pontifical
act
are
they
not
the
first
to
provoke
theological
discussions
we
are
compelled
to
take
their
ground
as
mgr
dupanloup
judiciously
observed
in
his
pamphlet
on
the
encyclical
of
the
december
is
needful
to
recur
to
first
principles
in
a
time
when
thousands
of
men
and
of
women
even
in
france
talk
theology
from
morning
to
night
without
knowing
much
about
the
first
and
fundamental
question
to
be
determined
is
what
is
the
precise
weight
to
be
ascribed
to
the
syllabus
or
rather
what
is
its
doctrinal
authority
on
the
manner
in
which
we
reply
to
this
depends
the
solution
of
numerous
practical
difficulties
which
interest
consciences
and
which
have
more
than
once
been
the
subject
of
the
polemic
of
the
journals
themselves
for
example
are
the
decisions
of
the
syllabus
unchangeable
is
it
not
possible
that
they
should
be
modified
some
day
is
it
certain
they
will
never
be
withdrawn
are
catholics
obliged
to
accept
them
as
an
absolute
rule
of
their
beliefs
or
may
they
content
themselves
with
doing
nothing
exteriorly
in
opposition
to
them
it
is
understood
in
fact
that
if
we
are
in
presence
of
an
act
wherein
the
successor
of
peter
exercises
his
sovereign
and
infallible
authority
the
doctrine
is
irrevocably
eternally
fixed
without
possible
recall
and
by
an
inevitable
corollary
the
most
complete
submission
not
of
the
heart
only
but
also
of
the
intelligence
becomes
an
obligation
binding
on
the
conscience
of
the
catholic
which
admits
of
no
reserve
or
subterfuge
if
on
the
contrary
the
step
taken
by
the
pope
is
merely
an
act
of
good
administration
or
discipline
the
door
remains
open
for
hopes
of
future
changes
the
constraint
imposed
on
the
minds
of
men
in
the
interior
forum
is
much
less
rigorous
a
caviller
would
remain
in
catholic
unity
provided
that
with
the
respectful
silence
so
dear
to
the
jansenists
he
should
also
practise
proper
obedience
now
the
question
in
the
terms
in
which
we
have
stated
it
although
treated
of
at
various
times
by
writers
of
merit
has
not
always
been
handled
in
a
complete
manner
writers
have
been
too
often
contented
with
generalities
with
approaching
only
the
question
and
nothing
has
been
precisely
determined
some
have
asserted
with
much
energy
the
necessity
of
this
submission
but
they
have
not
sufficiently
defined
its
extent
and
nature
others
have
dwelt
upon
the
deference
and
profound
respect
with
which
every
word
of
the
holy
father
should
be
received
but
not
having
given
any
further
explanation
they
have
left
us
without
the
necessary
means
for
ascertaining
what
precisely
they
intended
others
have
ventured
to
insinuate
that
the
syllabus
was
perhaps
merely
an
admonition
a
paternal
advice
benevolently
given
to
some
rash
children
to
which
such
as
are
docile
are
happy
to
conform
without
feeling
themselves
under
the
absolute
necessity
of
adopting
it
others
more
adventurous
still
have
been
unwilling
to
see
more
in
it
than
a
mere
piece
of
information
an
indication
according
to
these
pius
wishing
to
notify
to
all
the
bishops
of
christendom
his
principal
authoritative
acts
since
the
commencement
of
his
pontificate
had
caused
a
list
of
them
to
be
drawn
out
and
to
be
forwarded
to
them
the
syllabus
was
this
illustrious
catalogue
neither
more
nor
less
is
there
any
excuse
to
be
found
for
this
indecision
on
one
hand
presumption
on
the
other
we
do
not
think
so
but
they
do
we
must
confess
admit
of
a
plausible
explanation
and
here
let
it
be
observed
we
come
to
the
very
marrow
of
the
difficulty
the
syllabus
was
drawn
out
in
an
unusual
form
it
resembles
no
pontifical
documents
hitherto
published
when
in
other
times
the
sovereign
pontiffs
wished
to
stigmatize
erroneous
propositions
they
did
not
content
themselves
with
reproducing
the
terms
of
them
in
order
to
mark
them
out
for
the
reprobation
of
the
people
they
were
always
careful
to
explain
the
motives
of
the
judgment
they
delivered
and
above
all
to
formulate
with
clearness
and
precision
the
judgment
itself
invariably
the
texts
they
singled
out
for
condemnation
were
preceded
by
grave
and
weighty
words
wherein
were
explained
the
reasons
for
and
the
nature
of
the
condemnation
in
the
syllabus
there
is
nothing
of
the
kind
the
propositions
stated
without
commentary
are
classified
and
distributed
under
general
titles
at
the
end
of
each
of
them
we
read
the
indication
of
the
encyclical
letter
or
pontifical
allocution
in
which
it
had
been
previously
rebuked
for
the
rest
there
is
no
preamble
no
conclusion
no
discourse
revealing
the
mind
or
intention
of
the
pontiff
unless
it
be
the
following
words
inscribed
at
the
head
of
the
document
and
which
we
here
give
both
in
the
latin
and
in
english
complectens
præcipuos
nostræ

table
or
synopsis
containing
the
principal
errors
of
our
epoch
noted
in
the
consistorial
allocutions
the
encyclicals
and
other
apostolic
letters
of
our
most
holy
father
pope
pius
ix
we
may
add
that
nowhere
does
the
pope
formally
express
an
intention
of
connecting
the
syllabus
with
the
bull
although
he
issued
them
both
on
the
same
day
at
the
same
hour
under
the
same
circumstances
and
upon
the
same
subjects
he
left
it
to
the
public
common
sense
and
to
the
faith
of
christians
to
decide
whether
these
two
acts
are
to
be
taken
together
or
whether
they
are
to
be
considered
as
isolated
acts
having
no
common
tie
between
them
such
are
the
facts
minds
either
troubled
or
prejudiced
or
may
be
too
astute
have
drawn
from
them
consequences
which
if
we
lay
aside
accessory
details
of
not
much
importance
here
we
may
reduce
to
two
principal
ones
it
has
been
stated
and
they
who
hold
this
language
form
as
it
were
the
extreme
group
of
opposers
that
the
apostolic
letters
mentioned
in
the
syllabus
are
the
only
documents
which
have
authoritative
force
that
the
latter
on
the
contrary
has
no
proper
weight
of
its
own
absolutely
none
whether
as
a
dogmatic
definition
or
as
a
disciplinary
measure
or
even
as
a
moral
and
intellectual
direction
to
these
assertions
not
a
little
hazardous
have
been
added
others
whose
rashness
would
fain
be
hidden
under
the
veil
of
rhetorical
artifices
we
will
lift
the
veil
and
expose
the
naked
assertions
the
meaning
of
the
syllabus
it
is
stated
must
not
be
looked
for
in
the
syllabus
but
in
the
pontifical
letters
whence
it
is
drawn
the
study
of
the
letters
may
be
useful
not
only
is
that
of
the
syllabus
not
so
but
it
is
dangerous
because
it
often
leads
to
lamentable
exaggerations
to
know
the
true
doctrines
of
rome
we
must
search
the
letters
for
them
not
the
syllabus
in
fact
to
sum
up
all
in
a
few
words
as
a
condemnation
of
error
and
a
manifestation
of
truth
the
letters
are
all
the
syllabus
nothing
the
other
group
which
we
may
describe
as
the
moderates
knows
how
to
guard
itself
against
excess
it
does
not
diminish
the
authority
of
the
syllabus
to
the
extent
of
annihilation
very
far
from
it
it
recognizes
it
and
proclaims
it
aloud
but
struck
with
the
peculiar
form
given
to
the
act
it
asserts
that
it
is
impossible
to
discover
in
it
the
marks
of
a
dogmatic
definition
and
to
borrow
a
stock
expression
of
a
definition
the
syllabus
it
is
said
is
undoubtedly
something
by
itself
to
deny
it
would
be
ridiculous
and
absurd
it
has
a
weight
of
its
own
who
would
venture
to
dispute
it
it
may
be
termed
if
you
please
an
universal
law
of
the
church
so
only
that
its
pretensions
be
not
carried
further
and
that
it
does
not
claim
to
be
considered
an
infallible
decision
of
the
vicar
of
jesus
christ
what
then
have
we
to
do
but
to
demonstrate
that
the
syllabus
is
by
itself
and
independently
of
the
pontifical
acts
which
supply
the
matter
of
it
a
veritable
teaching
that
this
teaching
obliges
consciences
because
it
issues
from
the
infallible
authority
of
the
head
of
the
church
we
shall
not
have
omitted
it
seems
to
us
any
of
the
considerations
calculated
to
throw
light
on
this
important
subject
if
after
having
thus
followed
it
through
all
its
windings
and
discussed
all
its
difficulties
we
succeed
in
illustrating
the
triple
character
of
the
pontifical
act
its
doctrinal
character
its
obligatory
character
and
its
character
of
infallibility
to
assert
that
pius
when
he
denounced
with
so
much
firmness
to
the
christian
world
the
errors
of
our
time
did
not
propose
to
teach
us
anything
that
he
had
no
intention
of
instructing
us
was
even
at
the
time
of
the
appearance
of
the
syllabus
to
advance
a
sufficiently
hardy
paradox
but
to
state
it
to
maintain
it
at
this
time
of
day
when
we
are
the
fortunate
witnesses
of
the
effects
produced
by
that
immortal
act
is
to
speak
against
evidence
undoubtedly
we
stated
it
at
the
commencement
the
syllabus
is
not
sufficiently
known
nor
sufficiently
studied
little
known
as
it
may
be
however
it
can
not
be
denied
that
it
has
already
set
right
many
ideas
and
corrected
and
enlightened
many
minds
thanks
to
it
not
learned
men
only
and
those
who
are
close
observers
of
events
but
catholics
generally
perceive
more
clearly
the
dangers
with
which
certain
doctrines
threaten
their
faith
they
have
been
warned
they
keep
themselves
on
their
guard
they
see
more
distinctly
the
course
they
must
follow
and
the
shoals
they
must
avoid
pius

it
in

that
being
the

what
is
the
use
of
playing
with

if
vain
subtleties

this
fact

what

to
believe
it
is
then
useless
to
shelter
self
behind
words
of
doubtful
meaning
and
which
can
only
perplex
the
mind
without
enlightening
it
it
is
to
assume
gratuitously
the
air
of
men
who
wish
to
deceive
others
and
to
deceive
themselves
what
is
the
use
of
it
they
are
much
mistaken
who
imagine
themselves
to
be
proposing
a
serious
difficulty
when
they
demand
how
the
syllabus
which
before
its
publication
existed
already
in
the
letters
of
the
holy
father
can
possibly
teach
us
anything
new
let
us
for
the
sake
of
argument
since
they
ask
it
reduce
it
to
the
humble
of
echo
or
reverberator
if
we
may
be
pardoned
such
expressions
let
us
suppose
that
its
whole
action
consists
in
repeating
what
has
been
already
said
we
ask
if
an
echo
does
not
often
convey
to
the
ear
a
sound
which
without
it
would
not
have
been
heard
if
it
does
not
sometimes
send
back
the
sound
stronger
more
resounding
and
even
more
distinct
than
the
original
voice
it
is
not
a
new
voice
it
brings
to
us
be
it
so
but
it
does
bring
it
to
us
in
fact
and
is
able
to
give
it
to
us
again
fuller
and
more
sonorous
comparison
it
is
true
is
not
reason
we
will
therefore
abandon
the
redundancy
of
figurative
language
and
reply
directly
to
the
question
put
to
us
what
is
wanted
is
to
know
what
the
syllabus
is
in
itself
independently
of
the
pontifical
letters
which
are
its
original
sources
it
is
as
follows
it
is
at
least
a
new
promulgation
more
universal
more
authentic
and
therefore
more
efficacious
of
previous
condemnations
now
it
is
well
known
it
is
a
maxim
of
law
that
a
second
promulgation
powerfully
confirms
and
in
case
of
need
supersedes
the
first
the
history
of
human
legislation
is
full
of
instances
of
this
when
by
reason
of
the
negligence
of
men
of
the
difficulty
of
the
times
of
the
inconstancy
or
waywardness
of
peoples
a
law
has
fallen
into
partial
neglect
and
oblivion
they
in
whom
the
sovereign
power
resides
its
failing
authority
by
promulgating
it
anew
it
revives
thus
and
if
it
has
been
defunct
it
receives
a
second
life
what
can
the
greater
number
of
christians
know
of
so
many
scattered
condemnations
buried
one
may
say
in
the
voluminous
collection
of
pontifical
encyclicals
if
the
syllabus
had
not
revealed
them
how
could
they
respect
them
how
obey
them
it
was
necessary
that
they
should
hear
them
resound
in
a
manner
a
second
time
in
the
utterance
of
the
great
pontiff
in
order
to
be
able
to
submit
anew
to
their
authority
and
to
resume
a
yoke
of
which
many
of
them
did
not
know
the
very
existence
the
salvation
of
the
church
required
this
the
syllabus
is
however
not
only
a
new
promulgation
it
is
often
a
luminous
interpretation
of
the
original
documents
to
which
it
relates
an
interpretation
at
times
so
necessary
that
should
it
disappear
from
that
moment
the
meaning
of
those
documents
would
become
on
many
points
obscure
or
at
least
doubtful
it
is
worthy
of
remark
that
in
order
to
deny
the
doctrinal
value
of
the
syllabus
the
following
fact
is
relied
on
that
it
is
unaccompanied
with
any
explanation
with
any
reflections
is
a
dry
nomenclature
it
has
been
said
which
we
can
not
determine
either
the
character
or
the
now
it
happens
to
be
exactly
here
that
brevity
has
brought
forth
light
the
propositions
in
fact
isolated
from
their
context
appear
to
us
more
exact
in
stronger
relief
more
decidedly
drawn
one
may
perceive
that
in
the
bulls
their
forms
were
as
yet
slightly
indistinct
here
they
detach
themselves
vividly
and
with
remarkable
vigor
and
we
wish
that
all
our
readers
were
able
to
judge
of
this
for
themselves
they
would
better
understand
possibly
wherefore
certain
men
insist
with
so
much
energy
on
our
abandoning
the
syllabus
and
applying
ourselves
exclusively
to
the
sources
an
excellent
mode
of
preventing
certain
questions
from
becoming
too
clear
we
will
cite
a
few
examples
in
illustration
of
our
argument
the
second
paragraph
of
the
syllabus
has
for
its
object
the
condemnation
of
some
of
the
seven
propositions
contained
in
it
reproduce
the
doctrine
of
a
man
little
known
in
france
but
much
thought
of
in
germany
a
kind
of
independent
catholic
who
before
he
opposed
himself
to
the
church
from
which
he
is
now
we
believe
quite
separated
having
transferred
his
allegiance
to
the
pastoral
staff
of
the
aged
reinkens
wrote
some
works
destined
to
sow
among
the
students
of
the
university
of
munich
the
damaged
grain
of
infidel
science
we
allude
to
froschammer
a
canon
who
has
lost
his
hood
professor
of
misty
philosophy
as
befits
a
doctor
on
the
other
side
of
the
rhine
pius
ix
rebuked
his
errors
in
a
letter
addressed
to
the
archbishop
of
munich
the
december
we
will
lay
aside
the
syllabus
and
take
merely
the
letter
we
shall
find
in
it
only
the
condemnation
of
froschammer
and
his
works
nothing
whatever
else
but
who
in
this
our
country
france
has
ever
opened
the
works
of
froschammer
the
catholic
frenchman
who
might
read
the
letter
of
pius
ix
knowing
nothing
of
the
condemned
works
would
say
to
himself
munich
professor
has
doubtless
written
according
to
his
own
fancy
he
must
have
been
rash
as
every
good
german
is
bound
to
be
who
loses
himself
in
the
shadowy
mazes
of
metaphysics
after
all
there
is
nothing
to
show
that
he
has
written
exactly
my
opinions
why
should
i
trouble
myself
about
the
letter
of
pius
it
does
not
concern
another
example
in
paragraph
we
find
the
same
principle
of
modern
liberalism
enunciated
in
the
following
manner
this
our
age
it
is
no
longer
expedient
that
the
catholic
religion
should
be
considered
as
the
only
religion
of
the
state
to
the
exclusion
of
all
hac
nostra
non
amplius
expedit
religionem
catholicam
haberi
tanquam
unicam
status
religionem
cæteris
quibuscumque
cultibus
the
document
to
which
we
refer
is
a
consistorial
allocution
pronounced
the
july
and
it
commences
with
these
words
what
is
this
allocution
a
solemn
protest
against
the
criminality
of
the
spanish
government
which
in
contempt
of
its
word
and
oath
of
the
rights
of
the
church
and
the
eternal
laws
of
justice
had
dared
to
perjure
itself
by
abrogating
of
its
own
single
authority
the
first
and
second
articles
of
the
concordat
pius
full
of
grief
speaks
in
these
terms
know
venerable
brethren
how
in
this
convention
amongst
all
the
decisions
relative
to
the
interests
of
the
catholic
religion
we
have
above
all
established
that
this
holy
religion
should
continue
to
be
the
only
religion
of
the
spanish
nation
to
the
exclusion
of
every
other
the
proposition
of
the
syllabus
is
not
expressed
in
any
other
way
in
the
allocution
a
man
of
great
ability
or
a
scientific
man
taking
into
account
the
facts
and
weighing
carefully
the
expressions
of
the
pontiff
might
perhaps
detect
it
therein
but
how
many
others
would
it
wholly
escape
how
many
would
not
perceive
it
or
if
they
should
chance
to
catch
sight
of
it
would
remain
in
suspense
uncertain
which
was
rebuked
the
application
of
the
doctrine
or
the
doctrine
itself
how
many
in
short
would
be
unwilling
to
recognize
in
these
words
aught
but
the
sorrowful
complaint
of
the
vicar
of
jesus
christ
outraged
in
his
dearest
rights
return
however
to
the
syllabus
and
that
which
was
obscure
comes
to
light
and
manifests
itself
clearly
the
two
propositions
we
have
cited
do
not
appear
in
it
confused
or
uncertain
detached
on
the
contrary
from
the
particular
circumstances
which
were
calculated
to
weaken
their
meaning
and
clad
in
a
form
more
lofty
more
universal
more
abstract
they
receive
an
unspeakable
signification
no
hesitation
is
possible
it
is
no
longer
the
doctrine
of
froschammer
nor
the
sacrilegious
usurpations
of
the
spanish
government
which
are
rebuked
it
is
but
the
doctrine
considered
in
itself
and
in
its
substance
and
since
the
roman
pontiff
after
having
isolated
it
fixes
on
it
a
mark
of
reprobation
by
declaring
it
erroneous
he
denounces
it
to
all
ages
and
all
people
as
deserving
the
everlasting
censure
of
the
church
it
is
for
this
reason
as
far
as
ourselves
at
least
are
concerned
we
shall
never
accept
without
restriction
a
phrase
which
we
find
under
one
form
or
other
in
all
directions
even
from
the
pen
of
writers
for
whom
we
entertain
in
other
respects
the
highest
esteem
syllabus
has
only
a
relative
value
a
value
subordinate
to
that
of
the
pontifical
documents
of
which
it
is
the
no
we
are
unable
to
admit
an
appreciation
of
it
in
our
opinion
so
full
of
danger
we
must
not
allow
ourselves
to
weaken
truth
if
we
would
maintain
its
salutary
dominion
over
souls
they
talk
of
the
value
of
the
syllabus
what
is
meant
by
this
its
authority
it
derives
that
most
undoubtedly
from
itself
and
from
the
sovereign
power
of
him
who
published
it
it
is
as
much
an
act
of
that
supreme
authority
as
the
letters
or
encyclicals
to
which
it
alludes
the
meaning
of
the
propositions
it
contains
doubtless
many
of
these
if
we
thus
refer
to
their
origin
will
receive
from
it
a
certain
illustration
others
and
they
are
not
the
fewest
will
either
lose
there
their
precision
or
will
rather
shed
more
light
upon
it
than
they
receive
from
it
between
the
two
assertions
the
pontifical
letters
explain
the
syllabus
and
the
syllabus
explains
the
pontifical
letters
the
second
is
with
a
few
exceptions
the
most
rigorously
true
a
very
simple
argument
demonstrates
it
suppose
that
by
accident
or
an
unforeseen
catastrophe
one
or
other
of
these
documents
were
to
perish
and
not
leave
any
trace
of
its
existence
which
is
the
one
whose
preservation
we
should
most
have
desired
in
order
that
the
mind
of
pius
ix
and
the
judgment
of
the
church
concerning
the
errors
of
our
age
might
be
transmitted
more
surely
to
future
generations
most
fertile
in
subtleties
is
the
mind
of
man
when
he
wishes
to
escape
from
a
duty
that
molests
him
we
must
not
consequently
be
astonished
if
many
opponents
of
the
syllabus
have
lighted
on
ingenious
distinctions
which
allow
of
their
almost
admitting
in
theory
the
doctrines
we
have
just
explained
whilst
contriving
to
elude
their
practical
consequences
for
that
what
have
they
done
they
have
acknowledged
the
real
authority
of
this
grand
act
in
so
far
as
it
is
a
doctrinal
declaration
or
if
it
is
preferred
a
manifestation
of
doctrine
adding
nevertheless
that
the
pope
has
not
imposed
it
on
us
in
the
way
of
obligation
but
in
the
way
of
the
expression
only
in
the
way
of
guidance
would
have
been
a
happy
enough
invention
had
it
been
possible
in
matter
so
important
and
in
an
act
so
solemn
to
imagine
a
guidance
truly
efficacious
such
for
instance
as
the
pope
could
not
but
wish
it
to
be
which
would
not
be
an
obligation
but
we
ourselves
must
avoid
reasoning
with
too
much
subtlety
and
content
ourselves
with
opposing
a
difficulty
more
specious
than
solid
with
a
few
positive
proofs
we
interpose
in
the
first
place
the
very
title
of
the
syllabus
or
abridgment
of
the
principal
errors
of
our
time
pointed
out
in
consistorial
allocutions
etc
to
which
we
add
the
titles
of
various
paragraphs
in
relation
to
the
in
relation
to
civil
concerning
natural
and
christian
morals
etc
for
the
pope
the
guardian
and
protector
of
truth
obliged
by
the
duty
of
his
office
to
hinder
the
church
from
suffering
any
decline
or
any
alteration
to
denounce
to
the
christian
world
a
doctrine
by
inflicting
on
it
the
brand
of
error
is
evidently
to
forbid
the
employment
of
it
and
to
command
all
the
faithful
to
eschew
it
what
communion
is
there
between
light
and
darkness
between
life
and
death
there
can
be
no
question
about
guidance
or
counsel
when
the
supreme
interest
is
at
stake
the
duty
speaks
for
itself
it
is
imposed
by
the
nature
of
things
when
pius
ix
placed
at
the
head
of
his
syllabus
the
word
and
intensified
it
by
adding
words
even
more
significant
when
he
expressed
himself
thus
errors
of
this
our
age
he
as
good
as
said
is
death
avoid
and
if
in
order
still
to
escape
from
the
consequences
a
distinction
is
attempted
to
be
drawn
between
an
obligation
created
by
the
force
of
circumstances
and
an
obligation
imposed
by
the
legislator
we
would
wish
it
to
be
remembered
that
the
same
pius
ix
uttered
in
reference
to
the
syllabus
the
following
memorable
sentence
the
pope
speaks
in
a
solemn
act
it
is
to
be
taken
literally
what
he
has
said
he
intended
to
for
our
part
we
would
say
the
pope
has
done
he
intended
to
but
what
need
is
there
of
so
much
discussion
the
proof
of
what
we
have
urged
is
written
in
express
terms
in
the
letter
accompanying
the
syllabus
a
letter
signed
by
his
eminence
cardinal
antonelli
secretary
of
state
and
intended
to
make
known
to
the
bishops
the
will
of
his
holiness
it
is
sufficient
to
quote
this
decisive
document
which
we
do
in
full
on
account
of
its
importance
reverend
excellency
holy
father
pope
pius
profoundly
solicitous
for
the
safety
of
souls
and
of
holy
doctrine
has
never
ceased
since
the
commencement
of
his
pontificate
to
proscribe
and
to
condemn
by
his
encyclicals
his
consistorial
allocutions
and
other
apostolic
letters
already
published
the
most
important
errors
and
false
doctrines
above
all
those
of
our
unhappy
times
but
since
it
may
come
to
pass
that
all
the
political
acts
reach
not
every
one
of
the
ordinaries
it
has
seemed
good
to
the
same
sovereign
pontiff
that
a
syllabus
should
be
drawn
out
of
these
same
errors
to
be
sent
to
all
the
bishops
of
the
catholic
world
order
that
these
same
bishops
may
have
before
their
eyes
all
the
errors
and
pernicious
doctrines
which
have
been
reproved
and
condemned
by
he
has
therefore
commanded
me
to
see
that
this
printed
syllabus
be
sent
to
your
most
reverend
excellency
on
this
occasion
and
at
this
time
when
the
same
sovereign
pontiff
in
consequence
of
his
great
solicitude
for
the
safety
and
of
the
catholic
church
and
of
the
whole
flock
which
has
been
divinely
committed
to
him
by
the
lord
has
thought
it
expedient
to
write
another
encyclical
letter
to
all
the
catholic
bishops
thus
executing
as
is
my
duty
with
all
befitting
zeal
and
respect
the
orders
of
the
same
pontiff
i
hasten
to
send
to
your
excellency
this
syllabus
with
this
this
syllabus
placed
by
the
order
of
the
holy
father
the
eyes
of
all
the
bishops
what
else
is
it
we
ask
than
the
text
of
the
law
brought
under
the
observation
of
the
judges
charged
with
the
duty
of
causing
it
to
be
executed
what
is
it
except
a
rule
to
which
they
owe
allegiance
and
from
which
they
must
not
swerve
they
must
not
lose
sight
of
it
wherefore
because
it
is
their
duty
to
be
careful
to
promulgate
its
doctrine
in
their
own
teaching
because
it
is
their
duty
to
repress
every
rash
opinion
which
should
dare
to
raise
itself
against
and
contradict
it
it
is
thus
that
all
have
understood
the
commandment
given
to
them
the
fidelity
and
unconquerable
courage
of
their
obedience
prove
it
what
has
taken
place
in
france
in
the
midst
of
the
universal
emotion
produced
by
the
appearance
of
the
syllabus
the
government
abusing
its
power
had
the
sad
audacity
to
constitute
itself
judge
of
it
through
the
instrumentality
of
the
keeper
of
the
seals
minister
of
justice
and
of
public
worship
it
forbade
the
publication
of
the
pontifical
document
in
any
pastoral
instruction
alleging
that
contained
propositions
contrary
to
the
principles
on
which
the
constitution
of
the
empire
what
was
the
unanimous
voice
of
the
episcopate
letters
of
bishops
are
in
existence
to
bear
witness
to
it
all
united
in
the
same
mind
opposed
to
the
ministerial
letter
the
invincible
word
of
the
apostles
all
declared
that
they
must
obey
god
rather
then
man
and
two
amongst
them
ascending
courageously
their
cathedral
thrones
braved
the
menaces
of
a
susceptible
government
by
reading
before
the
assembled
people
that
which
they
had
been
forbidden
to
print
could
they
have
acted
all
alike
with
this
power
truly
episcopal
if
they
had
not
been
inspired
by
the
conviction
that
they
were
fulfilling
a
duty
and
putting
into
practice
the
adage
of
the
christian
knights
do
my
duty
happen
what
we
will
insist
no
further
on
this
point
we
approach
lastly
the
question
which
might
well
supersede
all
the
others
let
us
enquire
whether
the
syllabus
is
an
infallible
decision
of
the
vicar
of
jesus
christ
it
appears
to
us
that
in
reality
we
have
already
settled
this
question
can
a
definition
be
anything
else
than
an
instruction
concerning
faith
and
morals
addressed
to
and
imposed
on
the
whole
church
by
her
visible
head
upon
earth
how
can
we
recognize
it
except
by
this
mark
and
is
not
that
the
idea
given
to
us
of
it
by
the
council
of
the
vatican
read
over
the
words
so
weighty
and
selected
with
so
much
care
by
the
fathers
of
that
august
assembly
and
you
will
find
that
nothing
could
express
more
accurately
the
exact
and
precise
notion
of
it
after
that
all
doubts
ought
to
disappear
the
syllabus
emanates
from
him
who
is
the
master
and
sovereign
doctor
of
catholic
truth
it
belongs
exclusively
to
faith
and
morals
by
the
nature
of
the
subjects
of
which
it
treats
it
has
received
from
the
circumstances
which
have
accompanied
its
publication
the
manifest
character
of
an
universal
law
of
the
church
what
is
wanting
to
it
to
be
an
irreformable
decision
an
act
without
appeal
of
the
infallible
authority
of
peter
we
know
the
objection
with
which
we
shall
be
met
peter
may
speak
it
will
be
urged
and
not
wish
to
exert
the
plenitude
of
his
doctrinal
power
yes
but
when
he
restrains
thus
within
voluntary
limits
the
exercise
of
his
authority
he
gives
us
to
understand
it
clearly
he
is
careful
in
order
not
to
overtax
our
weakness
to
apprise
us
that
notwithstanding
the
obligation
with
which
he
binds
consciences
it
is
not
in
his
mind
as
yet
to
deliver
a
definitive
sentence
upon
the
doctrine
frankly
does
the
syllabus
offer
to
us
an
indication
however
faint
of
any
such
reserve
what
more
definitive
than
a
judgment
formulated
in
these
terms
is
error
that
is
is
any
revision
possible
of
such
a
judgment
is
it
possible
to
be
revoked
or
abrogated
does
it
not
settle
us
necessarily
in
an
absolute
conclusion
which
excludes
all
possibility
of
diminution
or
of
change
in
a
word
can
the
assertion
be
ever
permissible
in
these
days
truth
in
it
may
be
added
that
by
the
admission
of
all
friends
and
enemies
an
admission
confirmed
by
the
declaration
of
the
cardinal
secretary
of
state
the
syllabus
is
an
appendix
to
and
as
it
were
a
continuation
of
the
bull
to
which
no
one
can
reasonably
refuse
the
character
of
a
definitive
and
irreformable
decree
and
it
will
be
understood
how
unreasonable
it
would
be
to
despise
the
evidence
of
facts
in
order
to
cling
to
an
objection
without
consistency
and
which
falls
of
itself
for
want
of
a
solid
foundation
for
the
rest
the
mind
of
the
holy
father
is
not
concealed
as
has
been
at
times
suggested
under
impenetrable
veils
it
appears
the
moment
we
look
for
it
and
we
find
it
for
example
in
the
preparation
of
the
syllabus
it
should
be
known
that
the
syllabus
was
not
the
work
of
a
day
pius
ix
has
often
asserted
this
he
had
early
resolved
to
strike
a
signal
blow
and
to
destroy
from
top
to
bottom
the
monstrous
edifice
of
revolutionary
doctrines
to
this
end
immediately
after
the
proclamation
of
the
dogma
of
the
immaculate
conception
he
transformed
the
congregation
of
cardinals
and
theologians
who
had
aided
him
in
the
accomplishment
of
that
work
into
a
congregation
charged
with
the
duty
of
singling
out
for
the
apostolic
see
the
new
errors
which
for
a
century
had
been
ravaging
the
church
of
god
ten
years
passed
away
encyclicals
were
published
allocutions
pronounced
the
theologians
multiplied
their
labors
at
length
on
the
of
december
the
moment
of
action
appearing
to
have
arrived
pius
ix
addressed
to
the
world
that
utterance
whose
prolonged
echoes
we
all
have
heard
the
bull
and
the
syllabus
were
promulgated
it
is
obvious
that
an
act
so
long
prepared
and
with
so
much
anxiety
can
not
be
likened
to
an
ordinary
act
the
object
of
the
pontiff
was
not
simply
to
check
the
evil
it
was
to
uproot
it
the
object
of
such
efforts
could
not
have
been
to
determine
nothing
who
is
there
then
who
will
venture
to
assert
that
the
whole
thought
of
an
entire
reign
and
of
such
a
reign
as
that
of
pius
should
miserably
collapse
in
a
measure
without
authority
and
without
effectiveness
to
believe
it
would
be
an
outrage
to
affirm
it
would
be
an
insult
to
the
wisdom
and
prudence
of
the
most
glorious
of
pontiffs
but
what
need
is
there
for
searching
for
proofs
a
single
reflection
banishes
every
difficulty
we
have
in
the
church
two
means
for
ascertaining
whether
a
pontifical
act
is
or
is
not
a
sovereign
definition
an
infallible
decision
we
have
to
enquire
of
the
pontiff
who
is
the
author
of
it
or
the
people
who
subordinate
themselves
to
his
teaching
neither
one
nor
the
other
can
deceive
us
in
the
answer
they
give
the
divine
promise
continues
equally
assured
in
both
in
the
former
when
he
teaches
in
the
latter
when
they
listen
and
obey
it
is
what
the
theologians
call
active
and
passive
infallibility
admit
that
pius
ix
had
left
us
in
ignorance
that
he
published
the
syllabus
but
did
not
tell
us
what
amount
of
assent
he
required
of
us
well
none
of
us
are
in
any
doubt
as
to
that
how
many
times
has
not
this
people
said
how
many
times
has
it
not
repeated
with
an
enthusiasm
inspired
by
love
that
this
syllabus
despised
insulted
by
the
enemies
of
the
church
they
accept
as
the
rule
of
their
beliefs
as
the
very
word
of
peter
as
the
word
of
life
come
down
from
heaven
to
save
us
is
it
not
thus
that
have
spoken
one
after
the
other
bishops
theologians
the
learned
and
the
ignorant
the
mighty
and
the
humble
who
amongst
us
has
not
heard
this
language
a
celebrated
doctor
tanner
has
said
that
in
order
to
distinguish
amongst
the
teachings
of
the
church
those
which
belong
to
its
infallible
authority
we
must
listen
to
the
judgment
of
wise
men
and
above
all
consult
the
universal
sentiment
of
christians
if
we
adhere
to
this
decision
it
reveals
to
us
our
duties
in
regard
to
the
sovereign
act
by
which
pius
ix
has
withdrawn
the
world
from
the
shadow
in
which
it
was
losing
its
way
and
has
prepared
for
it
a
future
of
better
destinies
we
have
the
more
reason
for
acting
thus
as
hell
by
its
furious
hatred
gives
us
for
its
part
a
similar
warning
and
proclaims
after
its
fashion
the
imperishable
grandeur
of
the
syllabus
neither
has
it
nor
have
those
who
serve
it
ever
been
under
any
illusion
in
this
respect
they
have
often
revealed
their
mind
both
by
act
and
word
what
implacable
indignation
what
torrents
of
insults
what
clamor
without
truce
or
mercy
and
when
importunate
conciliators
interfered
to
tell
them
they
were
mistaken
that
the
syllabus
was
nothing
or
next
to
nothing
and
need
not
provoke
so
much
anger
how
well
they
knew
how
to
reply
to
them
and
to
bury
them
under
the
weight
of
their
contempt
at
the
end
of
at
the
moment
when
the
struggle
occasioned
by
the
promulgation
of
the
encyclical
and
syllabus
was
the
most
furious
an
agency
of
parisian
publicity
the
agency
bullier
could
insert
the
following
notice
encyclical
is
not
a
dogmatic
bull
but
only
a
doctrinal
letter
it
is
observable
that
the
syllabus
does
not
bear
the
signature
of
the
pope
this
syllabus
has
besides
been
published
in
a
manner
to
allow
us
to
believe
that
the
holy
father
did
not
intend
to
assign
to
it
a
great
importance
one
may
conclude
therefore
that
the
propositions
which
do
not
attack
either
the
dogma
or
morals
of
catholics
and
do
not
at
all
impeach
faith
are
not
condemned
but
merely
to
these
words
poor
in
sense
but
crafty
and
treacherous
in
expression
the
journal
replied
as
follows
are
now
people
who
tell
us
that
the
encyclical
is
not
a
dogmatic
bull
but
a
doctrinal
letter
that
the
eighty
propositions
are
not
condemned
because
they
do
not
figure
in
the
encyclical
but
only
in
the
syllabus
that
this
syllabus
does
not
bear
the
signature
of
the
pope
that
it
has
been
composed
only
by
a
commission
of
theologians
etc
these
people
would
do
better
to
be
silent
encyclical
or
syllabus
the
fact
is
that
the
theocracy
has
just
hurled
as
haughty
a
defiance
against
modern
ideas
as
it
was
possible
for
it
to
do
we
shall
soon
see
what
will
be
the
we
will
leave
them
to
settle
their
quarrels
between
themselves
for
ourselves
listening
to
these
voices
of
heaven
and
of
hell
of
the
church
and
of
the
world
which
coincide
in
exalting
the
work
eternally
blessed
by
pius
we
repeat
with
profounder
conviction
than
ever
the
syllabus
is
the
infallible
word
of
peter
and
if
our
modern
society
is
within
the
reach
of
cure
it
is
by
the
syllabus
that
it
is
to
be
saved
sir

more
historical
from
the
french
of
the
princesse
de
craon
i
in
a
sumptuous
apartment
whose
magnificent
furniture
and
costly
adornings
announced
it
as
the
abode
of
kings
in
a
large
gothic
whose
massive
sides
were
decorated
with
carvings
in
ebony
and
ivory
of
exquisite
delicacy
and
which
was
in
itself
altogether
a
model
of
the
most
skilful
workmanship
there
reclined
the
form
of
a
stately
and
elegant
woman
her
small
feet
but
beneath
the
heavy
folds
of
a
rich
blue
velvet
robe
rested
on
a
footstool
covered
with
crimson
brocade
embroidered
with
golden
stars
bands
of
pearls
adorned
her
beautiful
neck
contrasted
with
its
dazzling
whiteness
and
were
profusely
twined
amid
the
raven
tresses
of
her
luxuriant
hair
an
expression
of
profound
melancholy
was
imprinted
upon
her
noble
features
her
eyes
were
cast
down
and
the
long
drooping
lashes
were
heavy
with
tears
which
she
seemed
vainly
endeavoring
to
repress
as
she
sat
absorbed
in
thought
and
nervously
entwining
her
snowy
fingers
with
the
silk
and
jewelled
cord
which
according
to
the
fashion
of
that
day
she
wore
fastened
at
her
girdle
and
hanging
to
her
feet
this
royal
personage
was
catherine
of
aragon
daughter
of
ferdinand
and
isabella
of
spain
wife
of
henry
and
queen
of
england
the
king
himself
was
hurriedly
pacing
to
and
fro
in
the
apartment
with
contracted
brow
a
deeply
troubled
expression
gleaming
from
his
dark
eyes
and
obscuring
with
a
shade
of
gloomy
fierceness
the
naturally
fine
features
of
his
face
the
ordinary
grace
of
his
carriage
had
disappeared
his
step
was
hurried
and
irregular
and
every
movement
denoted
a
man
laboring
under
some
violent
excitement
from
time
to
time
he
approached
the
window
and
gazed
abstractedly
into
the
distance
then
returning
to
catherine
he
would
address
her
abruptly
with
a
sharp
expression
or
hurried
interrogation
neither
waiting
for
nor
seeming
to
desire
a
reply
while
this
strange
scene
was
being
enacted
within
the
palace
at
greenwich
one
of
an
entirely
different
nature
was
occurring
in
the
courtyard
from
the
road
leading
from
greenwich
a
cavalcade
approached
headed
by
a
personage
invested
with
the
roman
purple
and
apparently
entitled
to
and
surrounded
by
all
the
and
of
royalty
he
was
mounted
on
a
richly
caparisoned
mule
with
harness
adorned
with
silver
bells
and
tufted
with
knots
of
crimson
silk
this
distinguished
personage
was
no
other
than
the
archbishop
of
york
the
potent
minister
who
united
in
his
person
all
the
dignities
both
of
church
and
state
the
cardinal
legate
the
acknowledged
favorite
wolsey
to
increase
his
already
princely
possessions
to
extend
his
influence
and
authority
had
been
this
constant
endeavor
and
the
sole
aim
of
his
life
and
so
complete
had
been
his
success
that
he
was
now
regarded
by
all
as
an
object
of
admiration
and
envy
but
how
greatly
mistaken
was
the
world
in
its
opinion
in
his
heart
wolsey
suffered
the
constant
agony
of
a
profound
humiliation
compelled
to
yield
in
all
things
and
bow
with
servile
submission
to
the
haughty
will
of
his
exacting
and
imperious
master
who
by
a
word
and
in
a
moment
could
deprive
him
of
his
dignities
and
temporalities
he
lived
in
a
state
of
constant
dread
fearing
to
lose
the
patronage
and
favor
to
secure
which
he
had
sacrificed
both
his
honor
and
his
conscience
he
was
accompanied
on
this
journey
by
a
numerous
retinue
composed
of
gentlemen
attached
to
his
household
and
young
pages
carrying
his
standard
all
of
whom
were
eagerly
pressing
upon
him
the
most
obsequious
attentions
they
assisted
him
to
dismount
and
as
he
approached
the
palace
the
guards
saluted
and
received
him
with
the
utmost
military
deference
and
respect
and
with
an
air
of
grave
dignity
wolsey
passed
on
and
disappeared
beneath
the
arch
of
the
grand
stairway
let
us
again
return
to
the
royal
apartments
the
king
seeing
wolsey
arrive
immediately
turned
from
the
window
and
confronting
catherine
abruptly
exclaimed
madam
i
wish
you
to
retire
the
affairs
of
my
kingdom
demand
instantly
all
my
time
and
and
hastily
turning
to
the
window
he
looked
eagerly
into
the
courtyard
catherine
arose
without
uttering
a
word
and
approaching
the
centre
of
the
apartment
she
took
from
the
table
a
small
silver
bell
and
rang
it
twice
on
this
table
was
a
magnificent
cloth
cover
that
she
had
embroidered
with
her
own
hands
the
design
represented
a
tournament
in
which
henry
who
was
devoted
to
chivalrous
amusements
had
borne
off
the
prize
over
all
his
competitors
in
those
days
her
husband
received
such
presents
with
grateful
affection
and
sincere
appreciation
and
as
the
souvenir
recalled
to
her
mind
the
joy
and
happiness
of
the
past
tears
of
bitterness
flowed
afresh
from
the
eyes
of
the
unhappy
princess
in
answer
to
her
signal
the
door
soon
opened
the
ladies
in
waiting
appeared
and
arranging
themselves
on
either
side
stood
in
readiness
to
follow
their
royal
mistress
she
passed
out
and
was
slowly
walking
in
silence
through
the
vast
gallery
leading
to
the
apartments
when
wolsey
appeared
advancing
from
the
opposite
end
of
the
gallery
followed
by
his
brilliant
retinue
catherine
then
instantly
understood
why
the
king
had
so
abruptly
commanded
her
to
retire
suddenly
pausing
she
stood
transfixed
and
immovable
her
soul
overwhelmed
with
anguish
but
with
a
countenance
calm
and
impassible
she
awaited
the
approach
of
the
cardinal
who
advanced
to
salute
her
in
spite
of
all
her
efforts
however
she
could
no
longer
control
her
feelings
lord
cardinal
she
exclaimed
in
a
low
voice
trembling
with
emotion
the
king
waits
for
you
and
as
she
uttered
these
words
the
unhappy
woman
fell
senseless
to
the
floor
the
hardened
soul
of
the
ambitious
wolsey
was
moved
to
its
very
depths
with
compassion
as
he
silently
gazed
on
the
noble
woman
before
him
who
possessed
the
unbounded
love
and
grateful
esteem
of
all
her
household
not
only
as
their
sovereign
but
also
as
their
beneficent
mother
the
cloud
of
ambition
that
forever
surrounded
him
darkening
his
soul
and
obscuring
his
perceptions
was
for
the
moment
illuminated
and
for
the
first
time
he
realized
the
enormity
of
proceedings
against
the
queen
as
this
sudden
light
flashed
on
him
he
felt
remorse
for
having
encouraged
the
divorce
and
resolved
that
henceforward
all
his
influence
should
be
used
to
dissuade
his
sovereign
from
it
at
the
approach
of
the
royal
favorite
the
ushers
hastily
made
their
salutations
although
the
queen
had
been
permitted
to
pass
them
with
scarcely
the
slightest
mark
of
respect
and
seemed
to
consider
the
most
humble
and
servile
attitude
they
could
assume
before
him
as
only
sufficiently
respectful
they
hastened
to
throw
open
the
doors
before
him
as
he
advanced
and
wolsey
soon
found
himself
in
the
presence
of
the
king
who
awaited
his
arrival
in
a
state
of
almost
angry
impatience
what
do
you
come
to
tell
me
he
cried
you
bring
me
good
news
wolsey
whose
opinions
had
so
recently
undergone
a
very
great
change
for
a
moment
hesitated
he
at
length
replied
the
cardinal
legate
has
he
indeed
said
henry
with
an
ironical
smile
so
many
unsuccessful
applications
we
have
then
at
last
obtained
this
favor
well
i
hope
now
this
affair
will
proceed
more
rapidly
and
wolsey
remember
that
it
is
your
business
so
entirely
to
compromise
and
surround
this
man
that
he
shall
not
be
able
even
to
without
my
consent
and
sanction
and
above
all
beware
of
the
intrigues
of
the
queen
catherine
is
a
spaniard
with
an
artful
unyielding
nature
and
fierce
indomitable
will
she
will
without
doubt
make
the
most
determined
and
desperate
effort
to
enlist
the
legate
in
favor
of
her
the
decision
of
your
majesty
irrevocable
on
the
subject
of
this
divorce
replied
wolsey
in
a
hesitating
and
embarrassed
manner
farther
we
advance
the
more
formidable
the
accumulating
difficulties
become
i
must
acknowledge
sire
i
begin
myself
to
doubt
of
success
campeggio
has
already
declared
that
if
the
queen
appeals
to
rome
he
will
not
refuse
to
present
her
petition
and
defend
her
cause
that
he
himself
will
decide
nothing
and
will
yield
to
nothing
he
can
not
conscientiously
on
hearing
wolsey
express
these
sentiments
face
flushed
with
rage
and
a
menacing
scowl
contracted
his
brow
it
be
possible
he
cried
you
dare
address
me
in
this
manner
i
will
castigate
the
pope
himself
if
he
refuses
his
sanction
he
shall
measure
his
power
with
mine
he
trembles
because
charles
is
already
on
his
frontier
i
will
make
him
tremble
now
in
my
turn
i
will
marry
anne
boleyn
yes
i
will
marry
her
before
the
eyes
of
the
whole
world
do
you
say
sire
anne
boleyn
cried
wolsey
anne
boleyn
replied
the
king
regarding
wolsey
with
his
usual
haughty
and
contemptuous
expression
know
her
well
she
is
attached
to
the
service
of
anne
boleyn
again
cried
wolsey
after
a
silence
for
astonishment
had
almost
for
the
time
rendered
him
speechless
and
breathless
anne
boleyn
the
king
of
england
the
great
henry
wishes
then
to
marry
anne
boleyn
why
if
contemplating
such
a
marriage
as
that
did
you
send
me
to
seek
the
alliance
of
france
and
to
offer
the
hand
of
your
daughter
in
marriage
to
the
duke
of
orleans
and
why
did
you
instruct
me
to
declare
to
francis
that
your
desire
was
to
place
on
the
throne
of
england
a
princess
of
his
blood
it
was
only
by
these
representations
and
promises
that
i
succeeded
in
inducing
him
to
sign
the
treaty
which
deprived
catherine
of
all
assistance
you
have
assured
me
of
your
entire
approval
of
these
negotiations
this
alliance
with
france
was
the
only
means
by
which
to
secure
for
yourself
any
real
defence
against
the
pope
and
the
emperor
do
you
suppose
that
charles
will
quietly
permit
you
to
deprive
his
aunt
of
her
position
and
title
as
queen
of
england
here
wolsey
paused
wholly
transported
with
indignation
replied
the
king
i
can
easily
manage
and
pacify
him
by
fine
promises
and
long
negotiations
as
to
our
holy
father
i
will
stir
up
strife
enough
to
fill
his
hands
so
full
that
he
will
not
be
able
to
attend
to
anything
else
the
quarrels
of
austria
and
france
always
end
by
recoiling
on
his
head
and
i
imagine
he
will
not
soon
forget
the
sacking
rome
and
his
former
but
you
forget
said
wolsey
the
king
of
france
will
accuse
you
of
flagrant
bad
faith
and
will
you
bring
on
yourself
their
abhorrence
in
order
to
espouse
anne
boleyn
the
minister
pronounced
these
last
words
with
an
expression
and
in
a
tone
of
such
contemptuous
scorn
as
to
arouse
in
a
fearful
degree
the
indignation
of
the
king
accustomed
only
to
the
flattery
and
servile
adulation
of
his
courtiers
at
the
same
time
he
was
compelled
to
feel
the
force
of
the
reasoning
although
the
truth
only
served
still
more
to
irritate
and
enrage
him
wolsey
cried
henry
fixing
his
flashing
eyes
fiercely
upon
him
am
not
here
to
listen
to
your
complaints
i
shall
marry
whom
i
please
and
your
head
shall
answer
for
the
fidelity
with
which
you
assist
me
in
executing
my
head
sire
replied
wolsey
courageously
long
belonged
to
you
my
entire
life
has
been
devoted
to
your
service
and
yet
i
shall
most
probably
in
the
end
have
bitter
cause
to
repent
having
always
made
myself
subservient
to
your
wishes
but
your
majesty
will
surely
reflect
more
seriously
on
the
dishonor
you
will
necessarily
incur
by
such
a
choice
as
this
the
party
will
grow
stronger
and
stronger
and
i
tell
you
frankly
i
fear
lest
the
legate
be
cried
henry
elevating
his
voice
in
a
threatening
manner
have
already
declared
my
intentions
is
that
not
sufficient
as
to
the
legate
i
repeat
he
must
be
gained
over
to
my
cause
gold
and
flattery
will
soon
secure
to
us
that
tender
conscience
whose
scruples
you
now
so
sorely
apprehend
bring
him
to
me
is
suffering
too
much
sire
the
cardinal
is
aged
and
very
infirm
i
have
no
idea
he
will
be
in
a
condition
to
see
your
majesty
for
several
days
long
entirely
too
long
to
wait
replied
the
king
must
see
him
this
very
day
he
shall
be
compelled
to
make
his
appearance
i
wish
you
to
be
present
also
as
we
shall
discuss
affairs
of
importance
and
then
i
shall
with
these
words
henry
withdrew
and
went
to
look
for
a
casket
of
which
he
alone
carried
the
key
and
in
which
he
usually
kept
his
most
valuable
and
important
papers
during
his
absence
wolsey
remained
leaning
on
the
table
before
which
he
was
seated
absorbed
in
deep
and
painful
reflections
he
feared
henry
too
much
to
oppose
him
long
in
any
of
his
designs
besides
he
saw
no
possible
means
to
induce
him
to
change
his
resolution
he
had
felt
as
we
have
seen
a
momentary
compassion
for
the
misfortunes
of
the
queen
but
that
impression
had
been
speedily
effaced
by
considerations
of
far
greater
moment
to
himself
as
a
shrewd
diplomatist
he
regretted
the
alliance
with
france
besides
he
was
really
too
much
interested
in
the
welfare
of
the
king
not
to
deplore
his
determination
to
contract
such
a
marriage
but
the
cause
of
his
deepest
anxiety
was
the
knowledge
he
possessed
of
great
dislike
for
him
and
the
consciousness
that
her
family
and
counsellors
were
his
rivals
and
enemies
in
consequence
of
which
he
clearly
foresaw
they
would
induce
her
to
use
all
the
influence
she
possessed
with
the
king
in
order
to
deprive
him
of
favor
and
patronage
he
was
suffering
this
mental
conflict
when
the
king
reappeared
bearing
a
bronze
casket
carved
with
rare
perfection
placing
it
on
the
table
he
unlocked
it
among
a
great
many
papers
which
it
contained
was
a
very
handsome
book
the
printing
beautifully
executed
and
every
page
ornamented
with
arabesques
exquisitely
tinted
and
shaded
the
cover
formed
of
two
metal
plates
represented
in
the
figures
of
faith
hope
and
charity
as
young
virgins
bearing
in
their
hands
and
on
their
foreheads
the
allegorical
emblems
of
those
sublime
christian
virtues
emeralds
of
immense
value
surrounded
by
heavy
gold
settings
adorned
the
massive
gold
clasps
and
also
served
to
hold
them
firmly
in
their
places
on
the
back
of
this
book
deeply
engraven
in
the
metal
were
the
following
words
seven
henry
had
written
this
work
in
defence
of
the
ancient
dogmas
of
the
catholic
church
when
first
attacked
by
the
violent
doctrines
of
a
monk
named
luther
whether
the
king
had
really
composed
it
himself
or
whether
he
had
caused
it
to
be
secretly
done
by
another
and
wished
to
enjoy
the
reputation
of
being
the
author
he
certainly
attached
great
importance
to
the
work
not
only
had
he
distributed
it
throughout
his
own
kingdom
but
had
sent
it
to
the
pope
and
to
all
the
german
princes
through
the
dean
of
windsor
whom
he
instructed
to
say
that
he
was
ready
to
defend
the
faith
not
only
with
his
pen
but
if
need
be
with
his
sword
also
it
was
at
that
time
that
he
asked
and
obtained
from
the
court
of
rome
the
title
of
of
the
now
he
was
constantly
busy
with
a
manuscript
which
he
took
from
the
mysterious
casket
containing
a
treatise
on
divorce
and
to
which
he
every
day
devoted
several
hours
greatly
pleased
with
a
number
of
arguments
he
had
just
found
he
came
to
communicate
them
to
wolsey
the
latter
after
urging
several
objections
at
length
reminded
him
of
the
fraudulent
and
persistent
means
that
had
been
employed
to
extract
from
the
university
of
oxford
an
opinion
favorable
to
divorce
yet
added
the
cardinal
has
been
found
impossible
to
prevent
them
from
increasing
the
number
of
most
important
restrictions
and
thus
rendering
your
case
exceedingly
difficult
if
not
entirely
said
the
king
the
good
example
of
the
university
of
cambridge
are
we
still
to
encounter
scruples
consider
it
well
cardinal
in
order
not
to
forget
the
recompense
and
above
all
the
punishment
for
that
is
the
true
secret
of
success
you
will
also
take
care
to
write
to
the
elector
frederick
and
say
that
i
wait
to
receive
the
humble
apologies
of
that
man
luther
whom
he
has
taken
so
entirely
under
his
replied
the
cardinal
have
received
frequent
intelligence
with
regard
to
that
matter
which
i
have
scarcely
dared
communicate
to
why
not
demanded
the
king
you
presume
my
lord
cardinal
that
the
abuse
of
an
obscure
and
turbulent
monk
can
affect
me
and
besides
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
do
not
know
but
this
man
may
after
all
be
useful
to
me
he
has
attracted
the
attention
of
the
court
of
rome
and
may
yet
have
to
crave
my
sire
since
you
compel
me
to
speak
i
will
tell
you
that
far
from
making
humble
apologies
his
violence
against
you
has
redoubled
i
have
just
received
a
tract
he
has
recently
published
in
it
i
find
many
passages
where
in
speaking
of
you
he
employs
the
most
abusive
epithets
and
expressions
for
instance
he
repeatedly
declares
that
your
majesty
a
fool
an
ass
and
a
madman
that
you
are
than
a
hog
and
more
stupid
than
a
he
speaks
with
equal
scurrility
of
our
holy
father
the
pope
addressing
him
in
terms
of
the
most
unparalleled
effrontery
this
pretended
warning
which
is
of
course
intended
simply
as
an
insult

paul
my
petit
pope
my
young
ass
walk
carefully
it
is
very
slippery
you
may
fall
and
break
your
legs
you
will
surely
hurt
yourself
and
then
people
will
say
the
devil
does
this
mean
the
petit
pope
has
hurt
further
on
i
find
this
ridiculous
comparison
which
could
only
emanate
from
a
vile
and
shameless
pen
ass
knows
that
he
is
an
ass
the
stone
knows
that
it
is
a
stone
but
these
asses
of
popes
are
unable
to
recognize
themselves
as
he
concludes
at
length
with
these
words
which
fill
the
measure
of
his
impiety
and
degradation
i
were
ruler
of
an
empire
i
would
make
a
bundle
of
the
pope
and
his
cardinals
and
throw
them
altogether
into
that
little
pond
the
tuscan
sea
i
pledge
my
word
that
such
a
bath
would
restore
their
health
and
i
pledge
jesus
christ
as
my
security
fearful
blasphemy
cried
henry
a
christian
possibly
be
supposed
to
utter
such
absurd
blasphemous
vulgarities
i
trow
not
this
pretended
of
the
and
abuses
of
the
seems
to
possess
any
other
than
an
evangelical
character
no
one
can
doubt
his
divine
mission
and
his
christian
charity
a
man
who
employs
arguments
like
these
is
too
vile
and
too
contemptible
to
be
again
mentioned
in
my
presence
let
me
hear
no
more
of
this
intolerable
apostate
proceed
now
with
then
continued
the
cardinal
presenting
a
list
to
the
king

the
names
of
several
candidates
i
wish
you
to
consider
for
the
purpose
of
appointing
a
treasurer

exchequer

already
filled
most
honorably
a
number
of
offices

also

man
of
equal
ability
and
integrity
i
recommend
him
to
your
majesty
for
this

your
selection
most
unhesitatingly
replied
the
king
am
extremely
fond
of
more
and
perfectly
satisfied
with
the
manner
in
which
he
has
performed
his
official
duties
heretofore
you
will
so
inform
him

next

petition
your
majesty

cromwell
inquired
henry
have
no
recollection
of
replied
wolsey
is
of
obscure
birth
the
son
of
a
fuller
of
this
city
he
served
in
the
italian
wars
in
his
youth
afterwards
he
applied
himself
to
the
study
of
law
his
energies
and
abilities
are
such
as
to
entitle
him
to
the
favorable
consideration
of
your
him
be
confirmed
as
you
desire
replied
the
king
very
graciously
as
he
proceeded
to
sign
the
different
commissions
intended
for
the
newly
appointed
officials
wish
he
added
regarding
wolsey
with
a
keen
searching
glance
you
would
find
some
position
for
a
young
ecclesiastic
called
cranmer
who
has
been
strongly
recommended
to
me
for
the
brow
of
the
cardinal
contracted
into
a
heavy
frown
as
he
heard
the
name
of
a
man
but
too
well
known
to
him
he
immediately
divined
that
it
was
from
anne
boleyn
alone
the
king
had
received
this
recommendation
in
the
meantime
the
queen
had
been
carried
to
her
apartments
the
devoted
efforts
of
the
ladies
of
her
household
who
surrounded
her
with
the
tenderest
ministrations
soon
recalled
her
to
the
consciousness
and
full
realization
of
her
misery
now
the
night
has
come
and
found
catherine
still
seated
before
the
grate
absorbed
in
deep
thought
born
under
the
soft
skies
of
spain
she
had
never
become
acclimated
nor
accustomed
to
the
humid
foggy
atmosphere
of
england
like
a
delicate
plant
torn
from
its
native
soil
she
sighed
unceasingly
for
the
balmy
air
and
the
golden
sunlight
of
her
own
genial
southern
clime
such
regrets
added
to
the
sorrows
she
had
experienced
had
thrown
her
into
a
state
of
habitual
melancholy
from
which
nothing
could
arouse
her
and
which
the
slightest
occurrence
sufficed
to
augment
for
a
long
time
her
firmness
of
character
had
sustained
her
but
her
health
beginning
to
fail
and
no
longer
able
to
arouse
the
energy
and
courage
which
had
before
raised
her
above
misfortune
she
sank
beneath
the
burden
and
abandoned
herself
to
hopeless
sorrow
as
she
sat
all
alone
in
her
chamber
she
held
in
her
hand
a
letter
but
recently
received
from
her
native
country
reading
it
slowly
she
mused
dreaming
of
the
days
of
her
happy
childhood
when
suddenly
the
door
was
opened
and
a
young
girl
apparently
ten
or
twelve
years
of
age
ran
in
and
threw
her
arms
around
the
neck
of
the
queen
the
figure
of
the
child
was
slight
and
graceful
around
her
waist
was
tied
a
broad
sash
of
ribbon
with
long
ends
floating
over
her
white
muslin
dress
her
beautiful
blonde
hair
was
drawn
back
from
her
forehead
and
fastened
with
bows
of
ribbon
leaving
exposed
a
lovely
little
face
glowing
with
animation
and
spirit
and
a
frank
ingenuous
expression
at
once
prepossessing
and
charming
this
was
the
princess
mary
the
daughter
of
henry
the
future
consort
of
a
spanish
prince
to
whom
the
shrewd
diplomatist
wolsey
had
promised
her
hand
in
order
to
deprive
the
unfortunate
mother
of
this
her
only
remaining
consolation
is
it
my
dearest
mamma
she
exclaimed
you
are
again
in
tears
and
laughingly
she
took
the
handkerchief
from
the
queen
and
put
it
to
her
own
eyes
pretending
to
weep
now
this
is
the
way
i
shall
do
when
i
am
grown
up
for
it
seems
to
me
people
are
always
weeping
oh
i
wish
i
could
always
remain
a
child
and
then
i
should
never
be
miserable
listen
my
dear
mamma
she
continued
again
twining
her
arms
around
her
neck
is
it
that
you
are
always
weeping
and
so
sad
it
must
surely
do
you
harm
everybody
is
not
like
you
constantly
sighing
and
in
tears
i
do
assure
you
only
this
morning
i
was
at
park
with
alice
and
there
i
met
lady
anne
boleyn
she
was
laughing
gaily
as
she
promenaded
with
a
number
of
her
friends
i
ran
immediately
to
her
to
say
good
morning
for
i
was
really
very
glad
to
see
her
how
is
it
mamma
i
thought
you
told
me
she
had
gone
to
kent
to
visit
her
father
child
replied
the
queen
her
tears
flowing
afresh
i
told
you
was
true
but
she
has
since
returned
without
my
being
mamma
since
this
is
your
own
house
why
has
she
not
yet
presented
herself
i
am
very
sorry
she
has
acted
so
for
i
love
her
better
than
any
of
the
other
ladies
she
told
me
all
she
saw
in
france
when
she
travelled
with
my
aunt
the
duchess
of
suffolk
oh
how
i
would
love
to
see
france
lady
anne
says
it
is
a
most
beautiful
country
she
has
described
to
me
all
the
magnificent
entertainments
that
king
louis
xii
gave
in
honor
of
my
aunt
mamma
when
i
marry
i
want
the
king
of
france
to
be
my
you
you
also
love
anne
boleyn
replied
the
queen
yes
mamma
much
very
much
indeed
innocently
answered
the
child
am
very
sorry
she
is
no
longer
to
be
here
she
is
so
amiable
and
when
she
plays
with
me
she
always
amuses
me
so
much
my
dear
child
replied
the
queen
will
tell
you
now
why
people
weep
when
they
are
grown
up
as
you
say
it
is
because
they
very
often
love
persons
who
no
longer
return
their
do
you
believe
she
no
longer
loves
me
replied
the
impulsive
little
mary
with
a
thoughtful
expression
yet
mamma
i
kissed
her
this
morning
and
embraced
her
with
all
my
heart
however
i
now
remember
that
she
scarcely
spoke
a
word
to
me
but
i
had
not
thought
of
it
before
she
seemed
to
be
very
much
embarrassed
but
why
should
she
no
longer
love
me
when
i
still
love
her
so
dearly
as
mary
uttered
these
words
a
woman
entered
the
room
and
whispering
a
moment
in
the
ear
of
the
queen
placed
a
note
in
her
hand
catherine
arose
and
approached
the
light
after
reading
the
note
she
called
the
young
princess
and
requested
her
to
retire
to
her
chamber
as
she
had
something
to
write
immediately
that
was
very
important
mary
ran
gaily
to
her
mother
and
after
kissing
and
embracing
her
fondly
and
tenderly
again
and
again
she
at
last
bade
her
and
with
a
smiling
face
bounded
from
the
room
in
the
same
light
and
buoyant
manner
that
she
had
entered
it
said
the
queen
dear
child
you
have
left
for
my
sake
our
beautiful
spain
and
have
ever
served
me
with
faithful
devotion
listen
now
to
the
request
i
shall
make
go
bring
me
immediately
the
dress
and
outer
apparel
belonging
to
one
of
the
servant
so
my
lady
no
questions
i
have
use
for
them
you
will
accompany
me
i
must
go
to
london
this
heaven
my
dear
mistress
what
are
you
saying
cried
leonora
in
great
alarm
to
london
it
is
five
miles
you
will
never
be
able
to
walk
it
and
you
well
know
it
would
be
impossible
to
attempt
the
journey
in
any
other
way
they
would
detect
answered
the
queen
am
resolved
to
go
faithful
friends
inform
me
that
the
legate
has
arrived
henry
will
now
redouble
his
vigilance
i
have
but
one
day
if
i
lose
this
opportunity
i
shall
never
succeed
my
last
remaining
hope
rests
upon
this
if
you
refuse
to
accompany
me
i
shall
go
oh
my
beloved
mistress
cried
leonora
her
hands
clasped
and
her
eyes
streaming
tears
can
never
do
this
think
of
what
you
are
going
to
undertake
if
you
were
recognized
the
king
would
be
at
once
informed
and
we
would
both
be
so
leonora
but
what
have
i
to
lose
is
it
possible
for
me
to
be
made
more
wretched
shall
i
abandon
this
my
last
hope
no
no
leonora
i
am
accountable
to
my
children
for
the
honor
of
their
birth
go
now
my
good
girl
fly
there
is
not
a
moment
to
lose
fear
nothing
god
will
protect
us
leonora
shrewd
and
adroit
like
the
women
of
her
country
was
very
soon
in
possession
of
the
desired
habiliments
her
actions
might
have
excited
suspicion
perhaps
but
entirely
devoted
to
the
queen
as
she
was
she
felt
no
fear
and
would
without
hesitation
have
exposed
herself
to
even
greater
danger
had
it
been
necessary
in
the
execution
of
her
wishes
catherine
feigned
to
retire
and
after
her
attendants
had
been
dismissed
she
left
the
palace
closely
enveloped
in
a
long
brown
cloak
such
as
was
habitually
worn
by
the
of
that
period
the
faithful
leonora
tremblingly
followed
the
footsteps
of
her
mistress
they
breathed
more
freely
when
they
found
themselves
at
last
beyond
the
limits
of
the
castle
leonora
however
when
they
entered
the
road
leading
to
london
anxiously
reflected
on
the
danger
of
meeting
some
one
who
would
probably
recognize
them
her
excited
imagination
even
began
to
conjure
up
vague
apprehensions
of
the
dead
to
blend
with
her
fears
of
the
living
she
also
dreaded
lest
the
strength
of
the
queen
should
prove
unequal
to
the
journey
in
fine
she
feared
everything
the
sighing
winds
the
rustling
leaves
the
sound
of
her
own
footsteps
as
she
walked
over
the
stones
startled
and
filled
her
with
apprehension
very
soon
there
was
another
cause
for
alarm
the
wind
suddenly
arose
with
violence
dark
clouds
overspread
the
heavens
the
moon
disappeared
large
drops
of
rain
began
to
fall
and
soon
poured
in
torrents
deluging
the
earth
and
drenching
their
garments
in
vain
they
increased
their
speed
the
storm
raged
with
such
fury
they
were
compelled
to
take
refuge
under
a
tree
by
the
roadside
poor
leonora
said
the
queen
supporting
herself
against
the
trunk
of
the
tree
whose
branches
were
being
lashed
and
bent
by
the
fury
of
the
storm
regret
now
having
brought
you
with
me
i
am
already
sufficiently
miserable
without
the
additional
pain
of
seeing
my
burdens
laid
upon
beloved
lady
and
mistress
cried
leonora
am
not
half
so
unhappy
at
this
moment
as
i
was
when
i
feared
my
brothers
would
prevent
me
from
following
you
to
england
it
seems
to
me
i
can
see
the
vessel
now
with
its
white
sails
unfurled
bearing
you
away
whilst
i
standing
on
the
shore
with
frantic
cries
entreated
them
to
let
me
rejoin
you
that
night
i
remember
being
unable
to
sleep
i
went
down
into
the
the
perfume
of
whose
fruits
and
flowers
embalmed
the
air
of
the
palace
gardens
wiping
away
the
sad
tears
i
fixed
my
eyes
upon
your
windows
which
the
light
of
our
beautiful
skies
rendered
distinctly
visible
even
at
night
in
spain
at
that
hour
we
can
walk
by
the
light
of
the
stars
but
in
this
land
of
mud
and
water
this
horrid
england
one
has
to
be
wrapped
to
the
ears
in
furs
all
the
year
round
or
shiver
with
cold
from
morning
till
night
this
is
doubtless
the
reason
why
the
english
are
so
dull
and
so
tiresome
to
others
in
what
a
condition
is
this
light
mantle
that
covers
our
heads
said
leonora
shaking
the
coarse
woollen
cloak
dripping
with
water
that
enveloped
catherine
englishwomen
she
resumed
no
more
about
the
sound
of
a
guitar
than
they
do
about
the
rays
of
the
sun
they
are
all
just
as
melancholy
as
moles
there
is
not
one
of
them
except
the
princess
mary
who
seems
to
have
the
slightest
idea
of
our
beautiful
sighed
the
queen
is
just
as
i
was
at
her
age
god
forbid
that
her
future
should
resemble
that
of
her
mother
in
the
meantime
the
storm
had
gradually
abated
time
pressed
and
catherine
again
resumed
her
journey
with
renewed
courage
and
accelerated
speed
in
spite
of
the
mud
in
which
she
sank
at
every
step
she
redoubled
her
efforts
for
what
can
not
the
strong
human
will
accomplish
when
opposed
to
feeble
physical
strength
alone
or
even
when
the
obstacles
interposed
proceed
from
the
elements
themselves
she
at
length
arrived
at
the
gate
of
the
palace
of
lambeth
situated
on
the
banks
of
the
thames
where
the
cardinal
campeggio
according
to
the
intelligence
conveyed
to
her
would
hold
his
court
the
courtyards
the
doors
the
were
thronged
with
servants
and
attendants
eager
and
active
in
the
performance
of
their
duties
for
henry
had
ordered
that
the
cardinal
should
be
entertained
in
a
style
of
princely
munificence
and
entirely
free
from
personal
expense
all
these
valets
being
strangers
to
their
new
masters
and
unaccustomed
to
their
new
employments
permitted
the
queen
to
pass
without
question
or
detention
not
however
without
a
stare
of
stupid
curiosity
at
her
muddy
boots
and
draggled
garments
catherine
being
perfectly
familiar
with
the
interior
of
the
palace
had
no
difficulty
in
finding
the
cabinet
the
venerable
prelate
was
slightly
lame
and
in
a
feeble
and
precarious
state
of
health
she
found
him
seated
before
the
fire
in
a
large
velvet
engaged
in
reading
his
breviary
his
face
was
pale
and
emaciated
a
few
thin
locks
of
hair
hung
about
his
temples
hearing
the
door
open
he
rested
the
book
on
his
knee
casting
upon
the
queen
as
she
entered
a
keen
penetrating
glance
without
hesitation
catherine
advanced
towards
him
lord
cardinal
she
exclaimed
removing
the
hood
from
her
face
see
before
you
the
queen
of
england
the
legitimate
spouse
of
henry
hearing
these
words
campeggio
was
unable
to
suppress
an
exclamation
of
surprise
he
arose
at
once
to
his
feet
and
perceiving
the
extraordinary
costume
in
which
catherine
was
arrayed
he
cast
upon
her
a
look
of
incredulous
astonishment
he
was
about
to
speak
when
she
with
great
vehemence
interrupted
him
she
cried
raising
her
hands
towards
heaven
call
upon
god
to
witness
the
truth
of
what
i
say
i
am
queen
catherine
you
are
astonished
to
see
me
here
at
this
hour
and
in
this
disguise
know
then
that
i
am
a
prisoner
in
my
own
palace
my
cruel
husband
would
have
prevented
me
from
coming
to
you
they
tell
me
you
are
sent
to
sit
in
judgment
on
my
case
surely
then
you
should
be
made
acquainted
with
my
bitter
woes
and
grievances
lend
not
your
aid
to
the
cause
of
injustice
and
wrong
but
be
the
strength
of
the
weak
the
defence
of
the
innocent
a
stranger
in
this
country
i
have
no
friends
fear
of
the
king
drives
them
all
from
me
i
can
not
doubt
it
no
you
will
not
refuse
to
hear
my
appeal
you
will
defend
the
cause
of
an
injured
mother
and
her
helpless
children
what
would
you
be
willing
to
condemn
me
without
first
hearing
my
cause
i
the
daughter
of
kings
have
i
been
induced
to
marry
henry
of
lancaster
to
enjoy
the
honors
of
royalty
when
all
such
honors
belong
to
me
by
my
birthright
catherine
of
aragon
has
never
been
unfaithful
to
her
husband
but
misled
by
a
criminal
passion
he
wishes
to
place
upon
the
throne
of
england
a
shameless
woman
to
deny
his
own
blood
and
brand
his
own
children
with
the
stigma
of
illegitimacy
yes
i
solemnly
declare
to
you
that
nothing
can
shake
my
resolution
or
divert
me
from
my
purpose
strong
in
my
innocence
and
in
the
justice
of
my
cause
i
will
appeal
to
the
whole
world
aye
even
to
god
himself
the
cardinal
stood
motionless
regarding
catherine
with
reverence
as
an
expression
of
haughty
indignation
lighted
up
her
noble
features
he
was
struck
with
admiration
at
her
courage
and
filled
with
compassion
for
her
woes
madam
he
replied
am
not
to
be
your
judge
i
know
that
it
is
but
too
true
that
you
are
surrounded
by
enemies
but
let
me
assure
you
that
in
me
at
least
you
will
not
find
another
i
shall
esteem
myself
most
happy
if
by
my
counsel
or
influence
i
may
be
of
service
to
your
cause
and
it
is
from
the
depths
of
my
heart
that
i
beg
you
to
rely
upon
this
catherine
would
have
thanked
him
but
a
noise
was
that
moment
heard
of
the
ushers
throwing
the
doors
violently
open
and
announcing
in
a
loud
voice
eminence
cardinal
wolsey
heaven
cried
catherine
this
odious
man
pursue
me
for
ever
she
hurriedly
lowered
her
veil
and
took
her
place
at
the
left
of
the
door
and
the
moment
he
entered
passed
out
behind
him
wolsey
glanced
at
her
sharply
the
appearance
of
a
woman
arousing
instantly
a
suspicion
in
his
mind
but
being
compelled
to
respond
with
politeness
to
the
salutations
he
had
no
time
to
scrutinize
and
catherine
escaped
without
being
recognized
wolsey
was
passionately
fond
of
pomp
and
pageant
the
principal
positions
in
his
house
were
filled
by
barons
and
chevaliers
among
these
attendants
were
numbered
the
sons
of
some
of
the
most
distinguished
families
who
under
his
protection
and
by
the
aid
of
his
patronage
and
influence
aspired
to
civil
or
military
preferment
on
this
occasion
he
considered
it
necessary
to
make
an
unusual
display
of
luxurious
magnificence
it
was
with
great
difficulty
and
trepidation
that
the
queen
threaded
her
way
through
the
crowd
of
prelates
noblemen
and
young
gentlemen
who
awaited
in
the
the
honor
of
being
presented
by
the
favorite
to
the
the
courtyard
was
filled
with
their
brilliant
equipages
conspicuous
among
which
were
observed
a
great
number
of
mules
richly
caparisoned
and
carrying
on
their
backs
immense
chests
covered
with
crimson
cloth
trimmed
with
fringe
and
embroidered
with
gold
a
crowd
of
idle
valets
were
engaged
in
conversation
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
the
queen
in
passing
them
attracted
their
attention
exciting
their
ridicule
and
coarse
gibes
and
she
heard
them
also
indulge
in
the
most
insolent
conjectures
regarding
her
is
that
woman
said
one
how
dirty
she
looks
like
a
beggar
indeed
cried
another
addressing
himself
to
one
of
the
engaged
to
attend
the
legate
master
receives
strange
visitors
we
on
the
contrary
have
nothing
to
do
with
people
like
that
except
quickly
to
show
them
the
ha
you
will
have
your
hands
full
exclaimed
the
most
insolent
of
the
crowd
your
master
gives
audience
to
such
rabble
as
emboldened
by
these
remarks
one
of
the
porters
approached
the
queen
and
rudely
pushing
her
exclaimed
with
an
oath
beldame
what
brought
you
here
take
yourself
off
quickly
my
lord
is
rich
but
his
crowns
were
not
made
for
such
as
these
words
excited
the
loudest
applause
from
the
whole
crowd
who
clapped
their
hands
and
cheered
vociferously
catherine
trembled
with
mortification
is
thus
she
mentally
exclaimed
the
poor
are
received
in
the
palaces
of
the
rich
and
i
myself
have
probably
more
than
once
without
knowing
it
permitted
them
to
sigh
in
vain
at
the
gates
of
my
own
palace
mothers
weeping
for
their
children
or
men
old
and
helpless
making
a
last
appeal
for
the
queen
entirely
absorbed
in
these
reflections
together
with
the
impression
made
upon
her
by
the
appearance
of
the
venerable
legate
the
sudden
apparition
of
wolsey
the
snares
that
had
been
laid
for
her
and
the
temptations
with
which
they
had
surrounded
her
mechanically
followed
leonora
to
whom
the
fear
that
her
mistress
might
be
pursued
and
arrested
seemed
to
have
given
wings
at
length
cried
the
queen
feel
that
i
can
go
no
farther
stop
and
let
us
rest
for
a
moment
you
walk
too
exhausted
with
fatigue
she
seated
herself
on
a
rock
by
the
roadside
she
had
scarcely
rested
a
moment
when
a
magnificent
carriage
passed
the
silken
curtains
were
drawn
back
and
the
flaming
torches
carried
by
couriers
who
surrounded
the
carriage
completely
illuminated
the
interior
seated
in
this
princely
equipage
was
a
young
girl
brilliant
in
her
youthful
beauty
and
the
splendor
of
her
elegant
dress
and
jewelled
adornings
at
a
glance
catherine
recognized
anne
boleyn
who
was
returning
from
a
grand
entertainment
given
her
by
the
lord
mayor
of
london
she
passed
like
the
light
the
carriage
rapidly
whirling
through
the
mud
and
water
that
flew
from
the
wheels
and
covered
anew
the
already
soiled
garments
of
the
hapless
queen
catherine
completely
overcome
by
painful
emotions
felt
as
though
she
were
dying
listen
she
said
in
a
faint
voice
scarcely
audible
come
near
me
give
me
your
hand
i
feel
that
i
am
dying
you
will
carry
to
my
daughter
my
last
benediction
she
sought
in
the
darkness
the
hand
of
leonora
the
film
of
death
seemed
gathering
over
her
eyes
she
did
not
speak
her
head
sank
on
her
shoulder
and
poor
leonora
thought
the
queen
had
ceased
to
breathe
she
at
first
held
her
in
her
arms
but
at
length
overcome
by
fatigue
she
sank
upon
the
earth
as
she
vainly
endeavored
to
revive
her
by
breathing
into
her
mouth
her
own
but
seeing
all
her
efforts
to
restore
animation
useless
she
came
to
the
terrible
conclusion
that
catherine
was
indeed
dead
dear
mistress
she
cried
wildly
wringing
her
hands
good
mistress
is
dead
what
will
become
of
me
it
is
my
fault
i
should
have
prevented
her
from
going
ah
how
miserable
i
am
and
her
tears
and
cries
redoubled
at
length
she
heard
in
the
distance
the
sound
of
approaching
footsteps
and
was
soon
able
to
distinguish
a
litter
borne
by
a
number
of
men
she
cried
her
hopes
reviving
at
the
sight
and
very
soon
they
were
near
her
come
to
my
assistance
my
mistress
is
dying
seeing
two
women
one
lying
on
the
ground
supported
in
the
arms
of
another
who
appeared
the
person
who
occupied
the
litter
commanded
the
men
to
stop
immediately
and
he
quickly
alighted
it
was
the
king
he
also
was
going
to
london
to
see
the
legate
to
prevent
his
anxious
haste
from
being
known
and
commented
on
he
had
adopted
this
secret
conveyance
when
she
saw
him
leonora
was
paralyzed
with
apprehension
and
alarm
the
king
instantly
recognized
the
queen
and
the
unhappy
leonora
in
a
furious
voice
he
demanded
what
she
was
doing
there
and
where
she
had
been
but
in
vain
she
endeavored
to
reply
her
tongue
clove
to
the
roof
of
her
mouth
she
was
unable
to
articulate
a
word
transported
with
rage
at
her
silence
and
by
what
he
suspected
he
immediately
had
the
queen
placed
in
the
litter
and
ordering
the
men
to
walk
slowly
he
followed
them
on
foot
to
the
palace
catherine
was
carried
to
her
own
apartment
and
soon
restored
to
consciousness
but
on
opening
her
eyes
she
looked
around
vainly
hoping
to
behold
her
faithful
leonora
she
never
saw
her
again
she
had
been
taken
away
and
the
punishment
that
was
meted
out
to
her
or
the
fate
that
befel
the
unfortunate
girl
was
for
ever
involved
in
mystery
while
discord
filled
the
royal
palace
with
perplexity
and
sorrow
a
statesman
simple
and
peaceful
awaited
with
happiness
mingled
with
impatience
the
arrival
of
a
friend
in
his
house
all
around
him
seemed
possessed
of
redoubled
activity
the
family
table
was
more
elegantly
spread
fresh
flowers
decorated
all
the
apartments
the
children
ran
to
and
fro
in
the
very
excess
of
their
joy
and
delight
until
at
length
in
every
direction
the
glad
announcement
was
heard
has
come
he
has
come
the
entire
family
eagerly
descended
to
the
to
meet
and
welcome
the
visitor
and
sir
thomas
with
feelings
of
inexpressible
joy
folded
in
his
embrace
the
bishop
of
rochester
the
wise
and
virtuous
fisher
whom
he
loved
with
the
purest
and
tenderest
sentiments
of
friendship
last
you
are
here
he
exclaimed
happy
i
am
to
see
you
once
more
while
the
good
bishop
was
ascending
the
stairs
surrounded
by
a
troop
of
sir
youngest
children
margaret
the
eldest
daughter
came
forward
and
saluted
him
accompanied
by
lady
more
her
and
young
william
roper
her
affianced
husband
they
all
entered
the
together
and
after
engaging
a
short
time
in
general
conversation
sir
thomas
bade
the
children
retire
that
he
might
converse
with
more
freedom
dear
friend
he
exclaimed
taking
the
hand
again
in
his
own
can
not
express
the
joy
i
feel
at
your
return
i
have
been
so
long
deprived
of
your
presence
and
i
have
so
many
things
to
say
to
you
but
my
heart
is
too
full
at
this
moment
to
permit
me
to
express
all
i
feel
or
would
say
but
why
have
you
not
answered
my
letters
letters
replied
the
bishop
it
has
been
more
than
a
month
since
i
received
one
from
can
that
be
possible
unless
they
have
been
intercepted
replied
more
king
every
day
becomes
more
and
more
suspicious
if
this
continues
it
will
soon
be
considered
high
treason
for
a
man
to
can
not
tell
what
has
become
of
your
letters
i
only
know
i
have
not
received
them
and
it
has
caused
me
a
great
deal
of
anxiety
and
apprehension
but
my
friend
since
i
find
you
full
of
life
and
health
i
am
quite
satisfied
and
happy
now
let
me
hear
all
that
has
happened
at
court
but
let
me
begin
by
first
telling
you
that
the
king
has
sent
me
through
cardinal
wolsey
a
document
he
has
written
on
the
subject
of
divorce
asking
my
opinion
and
advice
i
have
answered
him
with
all
frankness
and
candor
expressing
myself
strongly
against
his
views
certainly
there
is
nothing
more
absurd
than
the
idea
of
the
wishing
to
repudiate
after
so
many
years
of
marriage
a
princess
so
virtuous
and
irreproachable
to
whom
he
can
find
no
other
objection
than
that
she
was
betrothed
to
his
brother
prince
arthur
besides
a
dispensation
was
obtained
on
that
account
at
the
time
of
his
marriage
therefore
it
would
seem
his
conscience
ought
to
be
perfectly
yes
his
conscience
should
be
entirely
at
rest
replied
sir
thomas
if
he
sincerely
believes
the
marriage
has
been
void
until
this
time
why
does
he
not
make
the
effort
to
have
it
rendered
legitimate
instead
of
endeavoring
to
annul
it
entirely
it
is
because
he
wishes
to
marry
one
of
the
ladies
the
young
anne
boleyn
horrible
cried
fisher
you
sure
my
friend
of
what
you
say
gracious
heaven
if
i
had
only
suspected
it
but
i
assure
you
i
have
had
entire
confidence
in
him
i
have
therefore
examined
the
subject
conscientiously
and
with
the
greatest
possible
diligence
before
giving
him
my
reply
had
i
suspected
any
such
scheme
as
this
i
should
never
have
had
the
patience
to
consider
the
arguments
he
has
presented
with
so
much
my
dear
fisher
replied
sir
thomas
is
the
sad
truth
and
such
are
the
that
disturb
the
tender
conscience
of
the
king
to
repudiate
the
queen
and
the
princess
mary
his
daughter
is
his
sole
aim
his
only
desire
i
also
have
received
an
order
to
read
and
give
my
opinion
on
the
divorce
question
but
i
have
asked
to
be
excused
on
the
ground
of
my
very
limited
knowledge
of
theological
matters
moreover
all
these
debates
and
hypocritical
petitions
for
advice
are
entirely
absurd
and
unnecessary
cardinal
campeggio
the
legate
has
already
arrived
from
rome
and
the
queen
will
appear
before
a
court
composed
of
the
legate
and
wolsey
together
with
several
other
queen
brought
to
trial
cried
the
bishop
of
rochester
queen
arraigned
to
hear
her
honor
and
her
rank
disputed
what
a
shame
upon
england
who
will
speak
for
her
i
would
give
my
life
to
be
called
to
defend
her
but
how
is
it
that
wolsey
the
wolsey
has
not
diverted
the
king
from
his
unworthy
purpose
is
said
to
have
tried
but
he
stands
in
awe
of
the
king
you
know
an
ambitious
man
never
opposes
him
to
whom
he
owes
his
power
nevertheless
added
more
can
not
believe
he
will
dare
to
pronounce
the
princess
mary
illegitimate
for
all
laws
aside
supposing
even
that
the
marriage
were
annulled
the
good
faith
in
which
it
was
contracted
invests
her
birth
with
an
inalienable
hope
it
may
be
so
said
fisher
what
immense
calamities
this
question
will
bring
on
our
unhappy
country
fear
so
my
friend
replied
more
present
the
people
are
pledged
to
the
cause
it
could
not
be
otherwise
she
is
so
much
beloved
and
esteemed
and
they
declare
if
the
king
does
succeed
in
repudiating
catherine
that
he
will
find
it
impossible
to
deprive
his
daughter
of
her
right
to
reign
over
wolsey
replied
the
bishop
thoughtfully
be
called
to
sit
in
judgment
on
his
sovereign
he
will
be
against
her
and
this
campeggio
what
says
he
in
the
matter
believe
replied
more
he
will
sustain
the
queen
he
seems
to
possess
great
firmness
and
integrity
of
character
his
first
interview
with
the
king
gave
us
great
hopes
henry
has
overwhelmed
him
with
protestations
of
his
entire
submission
but
all
his
artifices
have
been
frustrated
by
the
discernment
and
prudence
of
the
italian
cardinal
his
impenetrable
silence
on
the
subject
of
his
own
personal
opinions
has
plunged
the
king
into
despair
since
that
day
he
has
honored
him
with
incessant
visits
has
offered
him
the
rich
bishopric
of
durham
and
worked
unceasingly
to
corrupt
his
integrity
by
promises
and
keenly
the
queen
must
suffer
said
fisher
that
i
saw
at
the
time
of
her
arrival
in
the
kingdom
so
young
so
beautiful
and
so
idolized
by
henry
i
think
so
said
more
some
time
i
have
found
it
impossible
to
approach
her
however
she
appears
in
public
as
usual
always
gracious
and
affable
there
is
no
change
in
her
appearance
the
queen
is
truly
a
most
admirable
woman
during
your
absence
an
epidemic
made
its
appearance
called
the
sickness
which
made
terrible
ravages
wolsey
fled
from
his
palace
several
noblemen
belonging
to
his
household
having
died
very
suddenly
of
the
disease
the
king
was
greatly
alarmed
he
never
left
the
queen
for
a
moment
and
united
with
her
in
constant
prayers
to
god
firmly
believing
that
her
petitions
would
avail
to
stay
the
pestilence
he
immediately
despatched
anne
boleyn
to
her
father
where
she
was
attacked
by
the
disease
and
truly
we
would
have
felt
no
regret
at
her
loss
if
the
lord
in
taking
her
had
only
deigned
to
show
mercy
to
her
soul
at
one
time
we
believed
the
king
had
entirely
reformed
but
alas
the
danger
had
scarcely
passed
when
he
recalled
anne
boleyn
and
is
again
estranged
from
the
gives
us
terrible
lessons
replied
the
bishop
of
rochester
his
presence
we
judge
of
all
things
wisely
the
illusions
of
time
are
dissipated
to
give
place
to
the
realities
of
eternity
as
the
bishop
said
these
words
several
persons
who
had
called
to
see
sir
thomas
entered
the
room
conspicuous
among
them
was
cromwell
the
protégé
of
wolsey
this
man
was
both
false
and
sinister
who
made
use
of
any
means
that
led
to
the
acquisition
of
fortune
he
possessed
the
arts
of
intrigue
and
flattery
to
a
profound
dissimulation
he
added
an
air
of
politeness
and
a
knowledge
of
the
world
that
in
general
caused
him
to
be
well
received
in
society
a
close
scrutiny
of
his
character
however
made
it
evident
that
there
was
something
in
the
depths
of
this
soul
rendering
him
unworthy
of
any
confidence
to
him
vice
and
virtue
were
words
devoid
of
any
meaning
when
he
found
a
man
was
no
longer
necessary
to
his
designs
or
that
he
could
not
in
some
manner
use
him
he
made
no
further
effort
to
conciliate
or
retain
his
friendship
he
saluted
sir
thomas
and
the
bishop
of
rochester
with
a
quiet
ease
and
seated
himself
beside
young
cranmer
whom
i
am
very
well
acquainted
he
remarked
for
cromwell
like
all
other
intriguers
assumed
intimacy
with
all
the
world
scarcely
had
he
uttered
the
words
when
a
williamson
was
ushered
in
who
had
returned
to
london
a
few
days
before
after
a
long
absence
on
the
continent
so
you
are
back
williamson
cried
more
taking
his
hand
are
just
from
germany
i
believe
well
do
tell
us
how
matters
stand
in
that
country
it
seems
from
what
we
hear
everything
is
in
commotion
supposition
is
quite
correct
sir
replied
williamson
in
a
manner
emperor
is
furious
against
our
king
and
has
sent
ambassadors
to
rome
to
oppose
the
divorce
but
the
empire
is
greatly
disturbed
by
religious
dissensions
therefore
i
doubt
if
he
will
be
able
to
give
the
subject
as
much
attention
as
he
desires
new
reformers
are
every
day
springing
up
the
foremost
now
is
bacer
a
dominican
monk
then
comes
zwingle
the
curate
of
zürich
where
he
endeavored
to
abolish
the
mass
to
the
great
scandal
of
the
people
and
there
is
still
another
named
œcolampadius
who
has
joined
zwingle
but
strangest
of
all
is
that
these
reformers
among
themselves
agree
in
nothing
the
one
admits
a
dogma
the
other
rejects
it
they
think
this
that
every
day
some
new
doctrine
is
promulgated
luther
has
a
horror
of
zwingle
and
they
mutually
damn
each
other
the
devil
is
no
longer
able
to
recognize
himself
they
occasionally
try
to
patch
up
a
reconciliation
and
agree
altogether
to
believe
a
certain
doctrine
but
the
compact
is
scarcely
drawn
up
before
the
whole
affair
is
upset
cranmer
while
listening
to
this
discourse
moved
uneasily
in
his
chair
until
at
length
unable
to
restrain
himself
longer
he
interrupted
williamson
in
a
sharp
cutting
manner
that
he
endeavored
to
soften
truth
sir
you
speak
very
slightingly
of
these
learned
and
distinguished
men
and
only
it
seems
because
they
demand
a
reform
in
the
morals
of
the
clergy
and
preach
against
and
denounce
the
abuses
of
the
church
in
the
matter
of
reformers
cried
williamson
protest
against
an
abuse
which
they
alone
have
felt
as
such
and
that
but
for
a
very
short
time
and
permit
me
to
insist
on
your
observing
a
fact
which
it
is
by
no
means
necessary
or
expedient
to
forget
that
this
quarrel
originated
in
the
displeasure
felt
by
luther
because
it
was
not
to
his
own
order
but
to
that
of
the
dominicans
to
whom
the
distribution
of
indulgences
was
may
be
possible
sir
interrupted
cranmer
at
least
you
will
not
deny
that
the
immorality
of
the
german
clergy
imperatively
demanded
a
thorough
is
quite
possible
my
dear
sir
that
i
may
not
be
ready
at
once
to
agree
with
you
in
your
opinions
but
if
the
german
church
has
become
relaxed
in
morals
it
is
the
fault
of
those
only
who
before
their
elevation
to
the
holy
office
had
not
as
they
were
bound
to
have
the
true
spirit
of
their
vocation
but
i
pray
you
on
this
point
of
morals
it
will
not
do
to
boast
of
the
severity
of
these
new
apostles
the
disciples
of
christ
left
their
wives
when
called
to
into
all
the
world
and
preach
the
gospel
but
these
men
begin
by
taking
wives
luther
has
married
a
young
and
beautiful
nun
an
act
that
has
almost
driven
his
followers
to
despair
and
scandalized
and
excited
the
ridicule
of
the
whole
city
as
to
bucer
he
is
already
married
to
his
second
wife
cried
the
bishop
men
marry
marry
in
the
face
of
the
holy
church
do
they
forget
the
solemn
vows
of
chastity
they
have
made
for
they
are
all
either
priests
or
vows
oh
they
their
vows
they
say
these
are
what
they
call
and
the
priests
of
this
so
severely
reformed
church
will
hereafter
enjoy
the
inestimable
privilege
of
whilst
this
conversation
had
been
going
on
sir
thomas
kept
his
eyes
closely
fixed
on
cranmer
trying
to
discover
from
the
expression
of
his
pale
meagre
face
the
impression
made
on
him
by
the
conversation
he
was
well
convinced
that
latterly
cranmer
although
he
had
already
taken
orders
maintained
the
new
doctrines
with
all
the
influence
he
possessed
and
the
reason
why
he
had
so
thoroughly
espoused
them
was
because
of
a
violent
passion
conceived
for
the
daughter
of
osiander
one
of
the
chief
reformers
born
of
a
poor
and
obscure
family
he
had
embraced
the
ecclesiastical
state
entirely
from
motives
of
interest
and
ambition
and
without
the
slightest
vocation
his
sole
aim
being
to
advance
his
own
interests
and
fortunes
by
every
possible
means
and
he
had
already
succeeded
in
ingratiating
himself
with
the
earl
of
wiltshire
who
together
with
all
the
family
of
anne
boleyn
were
his
devoted
patrons
and
friends
it
was
by
these
means
that
he
was
afterwards
elevated
to
the
archiepiscopal
see
of
canterbury
where
we
will
find
him
servilely
devoting
himself
to
the
interests
of
henry
and
at
last
dying
the
death
of
a
traitor
influenced
by
such
motives
cranmer
warmly
defended
the
new
doctrines
bringing
forward
every
available
argument
and
ended
by
declaring
he
thought
it
infinitely
better
that
the
priests
should
be
allowed
to
marry
than
be
exposed
to
commit
sin
obliges
them
to
commit
sin
cried
the
bishop
of
rochester
who
was
no
longer
able
to
maintain
silence
the
contrary
sir
every
law
and
regulation
of
the
discipline
and
canons
of
the
church
tends
to
inspire
and
promote
the
most
immaculate
purity
of
morals
these
rules
may
seem
hard
to
those
who
have
embraced
the
ecclesiastical
state
from
motives
of
pride
and
an
ambitious
and
without
having
received
from
god
the
graces
necessary
for
the
performance
of
the
duties
of
so
exalted
and
holy
a
ministry
this
is
why
we
so
often
have
to
grieve
over
the
misconduct
of
so
many
of
the
clergy
but
if
they
complain
of
their
condition
now
what
will
it
be
when
they
have
wives
and
families
to
increase
their
cares
and
add
to
their
responsibilities
the
priest
continued
the
bishop
seeming
to
penetrate
the
very
depths
of
narrow
contracted
soul
you
ever
reflected
upon
the
sublimity
of
his
vocation
the
priest
is
the
father
of
the
orphan
the
brother
of
the
poor
the
consoler
of
the
dying
the
spiritual
support
of
the
criminal
on
the
scaffold
the
merciful
judge
of
the
assassin
in
his
dungeon
say
do
you
not
think
the
entire
human
race
a
family
sufficiently
large
its
duties
sufficiently
extended
its
responsibilities
wants
and
cares
sufficiently
arduous
and
pressing
how
could
a
priest
do
more
when
his
duty
now
requires
him
to
devote
and
give
himself
entirely
to
each
and
every
one
of
the
human
family
no
a
priest
is
a
man
who
has
made
a
solemn
vow
to
become
an
angel
if
he
does
not
intend
to
fulfil
that
vow
then
let
him
never
pronounce
it
rochester
cried
sir
thomas
more
greatly
moved
i
delight
to
hear
you
express
yourself
in
this
manner
and
sir
thomas
spoke
with
all
sincerity
for
the
bishop
without
being
conscious
of
it
had
faithfully
described
his
own
life
and
character
and
those
who
knew
and
loved
him
found
no
difficulty
in
recognizing
the
portrait
as
sir
thomas
spoke
the
door
again
opened
and
all
arose
respectfully
on
seeing
the
duke
of
norfolk
appear
that
valiant
captain
to
whom
england
was
indebted
for
her
victory
gained
on
the
field
of
flodden
he
was
accompanied
by
the
youngest
and
of
his
sons
the
young
henry
earl
of
surrey
even
at
his
very
tender
age
the
artless
simplicity
and
graceful
manners
of
this
beautiful
child
commanded
the
admiration
of
all
while
his
brilliant
intellect
and
lively
imagination
announced
him
as
the
future
favorite
and
cherished
poet
of
the
age
alas
how
rapidly
fled
those
golden
years
of
peace
and
happiness
later
and
norfolk
this
proud
father
so
happy
in
being
the
parent
of
such
a
son
lived
to
behold
the
head
of
that
noble
boy
fall
upon
the
scaffold
the
crime
of
which
henry
viii
will
accuse
him
will
be
that
of
having
united
his
arms
with
those
of
edward
the
confessor
whose
royal
blood
mingled
with
that
which
flowed
in
his
own
veins
sir
thomas
approached
the
duke
and
saluted
him
with
great
deference
the
bishop
of
rochester
insisted
on
resigning
him
his
chair
but
the
duke
declined
and
seated
himself
in
the
midst
of
the
company
was
not
aware
said
he
turning
graciously
towards
the
bishop
sir
thomas
was
enjoying
such
good
company
i
congratulate
myself
on
the
return
of
my
lord
of
rochester
he
will
listen
i
am
sure
with
lively
interest
to
the
recital
i
have
come
to
make
for
i
must
inform
you
gentlemen
i
am
just
from
blackfriars
where
the
king
summoned
me
this
morning
in
great
haste
to
assist
with
some
of
the
highest
dignitaries
of
the
kingdom
at
the
examination
of
the
queen
before
the
assembly
of
he
had
scarcely
uttered
these
words
when
an
expression
of
profound
amazement
overspread
the
features
of
all
present
more
was
by
no
means
the
least
affected
queen
he
cried
she
then
appeared
in
person
and
so
unexpectedly
and
rudely
summoned
they
have
done
this
in
order
that
she
might
not
be
prepared
with
her
defence
know
not
replied
the
duke
i
shall
never
be
able
to
forget
the
sad
and
imposing
scene
when
we
entered
the
cardinals
and
the
two
legates
were
seated
on
a
platform
covered
with
purple
cloth
the
king
seated
at
their
right
we
were
arranged
behind
his
chair
in
perfect
silence
very
soon
the
queen
entered
dressed
in
the
deepest
mourning
she
took
her
seat
on
the
left
of
the
platform
facing
the
king
when
the
name
was
called
he
arose
and
remained
standing
and
in
silence
but
when
the
queen
was
in
her
turn
summoned
she
arose
and
replied
with
great
dignity
that
she
boldly
protested
against
her
judges
for
three
important
reasons
first
because
she
was
a
stranger
secondly
because
they
were
all
in
possession
of
royal
benefices
which
had
been
bestowed
on
them
by
her
adversary
and
thirdly
that
she
had
grave
and
reasons
for
believing
that
she
would
not
obtain
justice
from
a
tribunal
so
constituted
she
added
that
she
had
already
appealed
to
the
pope
and
would
not
submit
to
the
judgment
of
this
court
having
said
these
words
she
stood
in
silence
but
when
she
heard
them
declare
her
appeal
should
not
be
submitted
to
the
pope
she
passed
before
the
cardinals
and
walking
proudly
across
the
entire
hall
she
threw
herself
at
the
feet
of
the
king
would
be
impossible
continued
norfolk
describe
the
emotion
excited
by
this
movement
she
cried
with
a
respectful
but
firm
and
decided
tone
beg
you
to
regard
me
with
compassion
pity
me
as
a
woman
as
a
stranger
without
friends
on
whom
i
can
rely
without
a
single
disinterested
adviser
to
whom
i
can
turn
for
counsel
i
call
upon
god
to
witness
she
continued
raising
her
expressive
eyes
towards
heaven
i
have
always
been
to
you
a
loyal
faithful
wife
and
have
made
it
my
constant
duty
to
conform
in
all
things
to
your
will
that
i
have
loved
those
whom
you
have
loved
whether
i
knew
them
to
be
my
enemies
or
my
friends
for
many
years
i
have
been
your
wife
i
am
the
mother
of
your
children
god
knows
when
i
married
you
i
was
an
unsullied
virgin
and
since
that
time
i
have
never
brought
reproach
on
the
sanctity
of
my
marriage
vows
your
own
conscience
bears
witness
to
the
truth
of
what
i
say
if
you
can
find
a
single
fault
with
which
to
reproach
me
then
will
i
pledge
you
my
word
to
bow
my
head
in
shame
and
at
once
leave
your
presence
but
if
not
i
pray
you
in
holy
name
to
render
me
she
was
speaking
a
low
murmur
of
approbation
was
heard
throughout
the
assembly
followed
by
a
long
unbroken
silence
the
king
grew
deadly
pale
but
made
no
reply
to
the
queen
who
arose
and
was
leaving
the
hall
when
henry
made
a
signal
to
the
duke
of
suffolk
to
detain
her
he
followed
her
and
made
every
effort
to
induce
her
to
return
but
in
vain
turning
haughtily
round
she
said
in
a
tone
sufficiently
distinct
to
be
heard
by
the
entire
assembly
tell
the
king
your
master
that
until
this
hour
i
have
never
disobeyed
him
and
that
i
regret
being
compelled
to
do
so
these
words
she
immediately
turned
and
left
the
hall
followed
by
her
ladies
in
waiting
refusal
to
remain
longer
in
the
presence
of
her
judges
and
the
touching
unstudied
eloquence
of
the
appeal
she
had
made
cast
the
tribunal
into
a
state
of
great
embarrassment
and
the
honorable
judges
seemed
to
wish
most
heartily
they
had
some
one
else
to
decide
for
them
when
suddenly
the
king
arose
and
turning
haughtily
towards
them
spoke
he
said
cheerfully
and
with
perfect
confidence
do
i
present
my
testimony
bearing
witness
to
the
spotless
virtue
and
unsullied
integrity
of
the
queen
her
character
her
conduct
in
every
particular
has
been
above
reproach
but
it
is
impossible
for
me
to
live
in
the
state
of
constant
anxiety
this
union
causes
me
to
suffer
my
conscience
keeps
me
in
continual
dread
because
of
having
married
this
woman
who
was
the
betrothed
wife
of
my
own
brother
i
will
use
no
dissimulation
my
lords
i
know
very
well
that
many
of
you
believe
i
have
been
persuaded
by
the
cardinal
of
york
to
make
this
appeal
for
a
divorce
but
i
declare
in
your
presence
this
day
this
is
an
entirely
false
impression
and
that
on
the
contrary
the
cardinal
has
earnestly
contended
against
the
scruples
which
have
disturbed
my
soul
but
i
declare
against
my
own
will
and
in
spite
of
all
my
regrets
his
opinions
have
not
been
able
to
restore
to
me
the
tranquillity
of
a
heart
without
reproach
i
have
in
consequence
found
it
necessary
to
confer
again
with
the
bishop
of
tarbes
who
has
unhappily
only
confirmed
the
fears
i
already
entertain
i
have
consulted
my
confessor
and
many
other
prelates
who
have
all
advised
me
to
submit
this
question
to
the
tribunal
of
our
holy
father
the
sovereign
pontiff
to
this
end
my
lords
you
have
been
invested
by
him
with
his
own
supreme
authority
and
spiritual
power
i
will
listen
to
you
as
i
would
listen
to
him
that
is
to
say
with
the
most
entire
submission
i
wish
however
to
remind
you
again
that
my
duty
towards
my
subjects
requires
me
to
prevent
whatever
might
have
the
effect
in
the
future
of
disturbing
their
tranquillity
and
unfortunately
i
have
but
too
strong
reasons
for
fearing
that
at
some
future
day
the
legitimacy
of
the
right
of
the
princess
mary
to
the
throne
may
be
disputed
it
is
with
entire
confidence
that
i
await
your
solution
of
a
question
so
important
to
the
happiness
of
my
subjects
and
the
peace
of
my
kingdom
i
have
no
doubt
that
you
will
be
able
to
remove
all
the
obstacles
placed
in
my
these
words
the
king
retired
and
started
instantly
for
his
palace
at
greenwich
the
noblemen
generally
followed
him
but
i
remained
to
witness
the
end
of
what
proved
to
be
a
tumultuous
and
stormy
debate
nevertheless
after
a
long
discussion
they
decided
to
go
on
with
the
investigation
to
hear
the
advocates
of
the
queen
and
continue
the
proceedings
in
spite
of
her
is
the
advocate
demanded
the
bishop
of
rochester
has
not
yet
been
appointed
replied
norfolk
seems
to
me
it
would
only
be
just
to
let
the
queen
select
her
own
she
will
refuse
without
a
doubt
replied
cromwell
the
manner
she
has
adopted
to
defend
they
continued
to
converse
for
a
long
time
on
this
subject
which
filled
with
anxious
apprehension
the
heart
of
sir
thomas
as
well
as
that
of
his
faithful
friend
the
good
bishop
of
rochester
to
be
continued

all
waste
and
solitary
places
where
we
taste
the
pleasure
of
believing
what
we
see
is
boundless
as
we
wish
our
souls
to
be
and
such
was
this
wide
ocean
and
the
shore
more
barren
than

that
long
desolate
tract
on
the
western
coast
of

the
gironde
and

adour
with
its
vast
forests
of
melancholy
pines
its
lone

and
solitary
deserts
its
broad
marshes
and
its
dunes

sand
that
creep
relentlessly
on

wonderfully
to
the
imagination

calls
it

in
spite

to

travel
for
hours
through
these
vast
steppes
covered
with
heather
without
discovering
the
smoke
of
a
single
chimney

anything
to
relieve
the
monotonous
horizon
unless
a
long
line
of
low

like
billows
swayed
to
and

in
the
wind
or
some
low
tree
standing
out
against
the
cloudless
heavens
perhaps
half
buried
in
the
treacherous
sands

gaunt
peasant

silhouette

we

a
kind
of

comes
over

in

yet
it

a

draws

on

they
are
devoting
more
and
more
attention
to
the
production
of
turpentine
by
planting
the
maritime
pine
which
grew
here
in
the
days
of
strabo
and
thereby
reclaiming
the
vast
tracts
of
sand
thrown
up
by
the
sea
a
priest
the
abbé
desbiez
and
his
brother
are
said
to
have
first
conceived
the
idea
of
reclaiming
their
native
deserts
and
staying
the
progress
of
the
quicksands
which
had
buried
so
many
places
and
were
moving
unceasingly
on
at
the
rate
of
about
yards
a
year
threatening
the
destruction
of
many
more
that
was
about
a
hundred
years
ago
a
few
years
after
brémontier
a
french
engineer
tested
the
plan
by
planting
as
far
as
his
means
allowed
the
maritime
pine
the
strong
fibrous
roots
of
which
take
tenacious
hold
of
the
slightest
crevice
in
the
rock
and
absorb
the
least
nutriment
in
the
soil
but
this
experiment
was
slow
to
lead
to
any
important
result
as
the
or
pine
plantations
involve
an
outlay
that
makes
no
return
for
years
it
was
not
till
louis
time
that
the
work
was
carried
on
with
any
great
activity
napoleon
iii
also
greatly
extended
the
plantations
the
importance
of
which
became
generally
acknowledged
not
only
to
arrest
the
progress
of
the
sands
but
to
meet
the
want
of
turpentine
in
the
market
so
long
dependent
on
imports
in
ten
years
the
trees
begin
to
yield
an
income
each
acre
then
furnishes
twelve
or
fifteen
thousand
poles
for
vineyards
or
the
coalman
the
prudent
owner
does
not
tap
his
trees
till
they
are
years
old
by
that
time
they
are
four
feet
in
circumference
and
yield
turpentine
to
the
value
of
fifty
or
sixty
francs
a
year
then
the
comes
with
his
hatchet
and
makes
an
incision
low
down
in
the
trunk
from
which
the
resin
flows
into
an
earthern
jar
or
a
hollow
in
the
ground
these
jars
are
emptied
at
due
intervals
and
the
incision
from
time
to
time
is
widened
later
others
are
made
parallel
to
it
these
are
finally
extended
around
the
tree
with
prudence
this
treatment
may
be
continued
a
century
for
this
species
of
pine
is
very
hardy
if
not
exhausted
when
the
poor
tree
is
near
its
end
it
is
hacked
without
any
mercy
and
bled
to
death
then
it
is
only
fit
for
the
sawmill
or
poor
and
desolate
as
the
landes
are
they

had
their
share
of
great

path
on
the
globe
may
lead
to
the
door
of
a
hero
says
some
one
we
have
spoken
of
la
teste
this
was
the
stronghold
of
the
stout
old
captals
de
buch
belonging
to
the
de
graillys
one
of
the
historic
families
of
the
country
no
truer
specimen
of
the
lords
of
the
landes
could
be
found
than
these
old
captals
who
poor
proud
and
adventurous
entered
the
service
of
the
english
to
whom
they
remained
faithful
as
long
as
that
nation
had
a
foothold
in
the
land
their
name
and
deeds
are
familiar
to
every
reader
of
froissart
the
nearness
of
bordeaux
and
the
numerous
privileges
and
exemptions
granted
the
foresters
and
herdsmen
of
the
landes
explain
the
strong
attachment
of
the
people
to
the
english
crown
the
de
graillys
endeavored
by
alliances
to
aggrandize
their
family
and
finally
became
loyal
subjects
of
france
under
louis
xi
they
intermarried
with
the
counts
of
foix
and
béarn
and
their
vast
landed
possessions
were
at
length
united
with
those
of
the
house
of
albret
where
would
the
latter
have
been
without
them
and
without
the
albrets
where
the
bourbons
and
this
reminds
us
of
the
sires
of
albret
another
and
still
more
renowned
family
of
the
landes
near
the
source
of
the
midou
among
the
pine
forests
of
maremsin
you
come
to
a
village
of
a
thousand
people
called
labrit
the
ancient
leporetum
or
country
of
hares
whence
lebret
labrit
and
albret
here
rose
the
house
of
albret
from
obscurity
to
reign
at
last
over
navarre
and
unite
the
most
of
ancient
aquitaine
to
the
crown
of
france
the
history
of
these
lords
of
the
heather
is
a
marvel
of
wit
and
great
hunters
of
hares
and
seekers
of
heiresses
they
were
always
on
the
scent
for
advantageous
alliances
not
too
particular
about
the
age
or
face
of
the
lady
provided
they
won
broad
lands
or
a
fat
barony
once
in
their
clutches
they
seldom
let
go
they
never
allowed
a
daughter
to
succeed
to
any
inheritance
belonging
to
the
of
albret
as
long
as
there
was
a
male
descendant
always
receive
and
never
give
was
their
motto
their
daughters
had
their
wealth
of
beauty
for
a
dowry
with
a
little
money
or
a
troublesome
fief
liable
to
reversion
the
albrets
are
first
heard
of
in
the
xith
century
when
the
benedictine
abbot
of
pierre
at
condom
alarmed
for
the
safety
of
nérac
one
of
the
abbatial
possessions
called
upon
his
brother
amanieu
for
aid
the
better
to
defend
the
property
the
sire
of
albret
built
a
castle
on
the
left
bank
of
the
baïse
and
played
the
of
protector
so
well
that
at
last
his
descendants
are
found
sole
lords
of
nérac
on
the
public
square
of
which
now
stands
the
statue
of
henry
the
most
glorious
of
the
race
the
second
amanieu
went
to
the
crusades
under
the
banner
of
raymond
of
gilles
and
entered
jerusalem
next
to
godfrey
of
bouillon
to
whom
an
old
historian
makes
him
related
nobody
knows
how
oihenard
says
the
albrets
descended
from
the
old
kings
of
navarre
and
a
of
the
xivth
century
links
them
with
the
counts
of
bigorre
but
this
was
probably
to
flatter
the
pride
of
the
house
after
it
rose
to
importance
we
find
a
lord
of
albret
in
the
service
of
the
black
prince
with
a
thousand
lances
five
thousand
men
and
owner
of
casteljaloux
lavazan
and
somehow
of
the
abbey
of
but
not
finding
the
english
service
sufficiently
lucrative
he
passed
over
to
the
enemy
charles
was
so
able
a
captain
that
he
quartered
the
lilies
of
france
on
his
shield
and
held
the
sword
till
the
fatal
battle
of
agincourt
alain
made
a
fine
point
in
the
game
by
marrying
françoise
de
bretagne
who
though
ugly
was
the
niece
and
only
heiress
of
jean
de
blois
lord
of
périgord
and
limoges
his
son
had
still
better
luck
he
married
catherine
of
navarre
if
he
lost
his
possessions
beyond
the
pyrenees
he
kept
the
county
of
foix
and
soon
added
the
lands
of
astarac
henry
of
navarre
by
marrying
margaret
of
valois
acquired
all
the
spoils
of
the
house
of
armagnac
thus
the
princely
house
of
navarre
under
their
daughter
jeanne
who
married
antoine
de
bourbon
was
owner
of
all
gascony
and
part
of
guienne
it
was
henry
iv
of
france
who
finally
realized
the
expression
of
the
blind
faith
of
the
house
of
albret
in
its
fortune
expressed
in
the
prophetic
device
graven
on
the
château
de
coarraze
where
he
passed
his
boyhood
que
ha
de
ser
no
puede
that
which
must
be
will
be
but
we
have
not
yet
come
to
the
door
of
our
hero
there
is
another
native
of
the
landes
whose
fame
has
gone
out
through
the
whole
earth
whose
whole
life
and
aim
were
in
utter
contrast
with
the
spirit
of
these
old
lords
of
the
heather
the
only
armor
he
ever
put
on
was
that
of
righteousness
the
only
sword
that
of
the
truth
the
only
jewel
that
which
the
old
rabbis
say
abraham
wore
the
light
of
which
raised
up
the
bowed
down
and
healed
the
sick
and
after
his
death
was
placed
among
the
stars
it
need
not
be
said
we
refer
to
vincent
de
paul
the
great
initiator
of
public
charity
in
france
who
by
his
benevolence
perhaps
effected
as
much
for
the
good
of
the
kingdom
as
richelieu
with
his
political
genius
he
was
born
during
the
religious
conflicts
of
the
xvith
century
in
the
little
hamlet
of
ranquine
in
the
parish
of
pouy
on
the
border
of
the
landes
a
few
miles
from
dax
it
must
not
be
supposed
the
in
his
name
is
indicative
of
nobility
in
former
times
people
who
had
no
name
but
that
given
them
at
the
baptismal
font
often
added
the
place
of
their
birth
to
prevent
confusion
vincent
was
the
son
of
a
peasant
and
spent
his
childhood
in
watching
his
scanty
flock
among
the
moors
the
poor
cottage
in
which
he
was
born
is
still
standing
and
near
it
the
gigantic
old
oak
to
the
hollow
of
which
he
used
to
retire
to
pray
both
of
which
are
objects
of
veneration
to
the
pious
pilgrim
of
all
ranks
and
all
lands
somewhere
in
these
vast
solitudes
whether
among
the
ruins
of
notre
dame
de
buglose
destroyed
a
little
before
by
the
huguenots
or
in
his
secret
oratory
in
the
oak
we
can
not
say
he
heard
the
mysterious
voice
which
once
whispered
to
joan
of
arc
among
the
forests
of
lorraine
a
voice
difficult
to
resist
which
decided
his
vocation
in
life
he
resolved
to
enter
the
priesthood
the
franciscans
of
dax
lent
him
books
and
a
cell
and
gave
him
a
pittance
for
the
love
of
god
but
he
finished
his
studies
and
took
his
degree
at
toulouse
as
was
only
discovered
by
papers
found
after
his
death
so
unostentatious
was
his
life
he
partly
defrayed
his
expenses
at
toulouse
by
becoming
the
tutor
of
some
young
noblemen
of
buzet
near
the
latter
place
was
a
solitary
mountain
chapel
in
the
woods
not
far
from
the
banks
of
the
tarn
called
notre
dame
de
grâce
its
secluded
position
the
simplicity
of
its
decorations
and
the
devotion
he
experienced
in
this
quiet
oratory
attracted
the
pious
student
and
he
often
retired
there
to
pray
before
the
altar
of
our
lady
of
grace
it
was
there
he
found
strength
to
take
upon
himself
the
yoke
of
the
priesthood
a
yoke
angels
might
fear
to
bear
it
was
there
in
solitude
and
silence
assisted
by
a
priest
and
a
clerk
that
he
offered
his
first
mass
for
so
terrified
was
he
by
the
importance
and
sublimity
of
this
divine
function
he
had
not
the
courage
to
celebrate
it
in
public
this
chapel
is
still
standing
and
is
annually
crowded
with
pilgrims
on
the
festival
of
vincent
of
paul
it
is
good
to
kneel
on
the
worn
where
the
saint
once
prayed
and
pour
out
soul
before
the
altar
that
witnessed
the
fervor
of
his
first
mass
the
of
the
lazarists
visited
this
interesting
chapel
in
accompanied
by
nearly
fifty
sisters
of
charity
they
brought
a
relic
of
the
saint
a
chalice
and
some
vestments
for
the
use
of
the
chaplain
and
a
bust
of
vincent
for
the
new
altar
to
his
memory
every
step
in
life
is
marked
by
the
unmistakable
hand
of
divine
providence
captured
in
a
voyage
by
algerine
pirates
he
is
sold
in
the
of
tunis
that
he
might
learn
to
sympathize
with
those
who
are
in
bonds
he
falls
into
the
hands
of
a
renegade
who
with
his
whole
family
is
soon
converted
and
makes
his
escape
from
the
country
vincent
presents
them
to
the
papal
legate
at
avignon
and
goes
to
rome
whence
he
returns
charged
with
a
confidential
mission
by
cardinal
he
afterwards
becomes
a
tutor
in
the
family
of
the
comte
de
gondi
another
providential
event
the
count
is
of
the
galleys
and
the
owner
of
vast
possessions
in
normandy
vincent
labors
among
the
convicts
and
if
he
can
not
release
them
from
their
bonds
he
teaches
them
to
bear
their
sufferings
in
a
spirit
of
expiation
he
establishes
rural
missions
in
normandy
and
founds
the
college
of
and
the
house
of
lazare
at
paris
a
holy
widow

little

unnatural
mothers
are
dying
of
cold
and
hunger
in
the
streets
vincent
opens
a
foundling
asylum
and
during
the
cold
winter
nights
he
goes
alone
through
the
most
dangerous
quarters
of
old
paris
in
search
of
these
poor
waifs
of
humanity
clerical
instruction
is
needed
and
richelieu
at
his
instance
endows
the
first
ecclesiastical
seminary
the
moral
condition
of
the
army
excites
the
compassion
and
the
cardinal
authorizes

he
becomes
a

he
is
for
peace
and
negotiates
between
the
queen
and
the
parliament
the
foundation
of
a
hospital
for
old
men
marks
the
end
of
his
noble
unselfish
life
the
jewel
of
charity
never
ceases
to
glow
in
his
breast
it
is
his
great
bequest
to
his
spiritual
children
how
potent
it
has
been
is
proved
by
the
incalculable
good
effected
to
this
day
by
the
lazarists
sisters
of
charity
and
society
of
vincent
of
paul
beautiful
constellations
in
the
firmament
of
the
church
in
the
midst
of
his
honors
vincent
never
forgot
his
humble
origin
but
often
referred
to
it
with
the
true
spirit
of
nesciri
et
pro
nihilo
not
that
he
was
inaccessible
to
human
weakness
but
he
knew
how
to
resist
it
we
read
in
his
interesting
by
abbé
maynard
that
the
porter
of
the
college
of
informed
the
superior
one
day
that
a
peasant
styling
himself
his
nephew
was
at
the
door
vincent
blushed
and
ordered
him
to
be
taken
up
to
his
room
then
he
blushed
for
having
blushed
and
going
down
into
the
street
embraced
his
nephew
and
led
him
into
the
court
where
summoning
all
the
professors
of
the
college
he
presented
the
confused
youth
this
is
the
most
respectable
of
my
and
he
continued
during
the
remainder
of
his
visit
to
introduce
him
to
visitors
of
every
rank
as
if
he
were
some
great
lord
in
order
to
avenge
his
first
movement
of
pride
and
when
not
long
after
he
made
a
retreat
he
publicly
humbled
himself
before
his
associates
pray
for
one
who
through
pride
wished
to
take
his
nephew
secretly
to
his
room
because
he
was
a
peasant
and
poorly
vincent
returned
only
once
to
his
native
place
after
he
began
his
apostolic
career
this
was
at
the
close
of
a
mission
among
the
convicts
of
bordeaux
during
his
visit
he
solemnly
renewed
his
baptismal
vows
in
the
village
church
where
he
had
been
baptized
and
made
his
first
communion
and
on
the
day
of
his
departure
he
went
with
bare
feet
on
a
pilgrimage
to
notre
dame
de
buglose
among
whose
ruins
he
had
so
often
prayed
in
his
childhood
but
which
was
now
rebuilt
he
was
accompanied
not
only
by
his
relatives
but
by
all
the
villagers
who
were
justly
proud
of
their
countryman
he
sang
a
solemn
mass
at
the
altar
of
our
lady
and
afterwards
assembled
the
whole
family
around
the
table
for
a
modest
repast
at
the
end
of
which
he
rose
to
take
leave
of
them
they
all
fell
at
his
feet
and
implored
his
blessing
i
give
you
my
blessing
replied
he
much
affected
i
bless
you
poor
and
humble
and
beg
our
lord
to
continue
among
you
the
grace
of
holy
poverty
never
abandon
the
condition
in
which
you
were
born
this
is
my
earnest
recommendation
which
i
beg
you
to
transmit
as
a
heritage
to
your
children
farewell
for
ever
his
advice
was
religiously
kept
by
mutual
assistance
his
family
might
have
risen
above
its
original
obscurity
some
of
his
family
were
advocates
at
the
parliament
of
bordeaux
and
it
would
have
been
easy
to
obtain
offices
that
would
have
given
them
at
least
prominence
in
their
own
village
but
they
clung
to
their
rural
pursuits
the
advice
of
their
sainted
relative
was
too
precious
a
legacy
to
be
renounced
not
that
vincent
was
insensible
to
their
condition
or
unambitious
by
nature
but
he
knew
the
value
of
the
hidden
life
and
the
perils
of
worldly
ambition
we
have
on
this
occasion
another
glimpse
of
his
struggles
with
nature
hardly
had
he
left
his
relatives
before
he
gave
vent
to
his
emotion
in
a
flood
of
tears
and
he
almost
reproached
himself
for
leaving
them
in
their
poverty
but
let
us
quote
his
own
words
day
i
left
home
i
was
so
filled
with
sorrow
at
separating
from
my
poor
relatives
that
i
wept
as
i
went
along
wept
almost
incessantly
then
came
the
thought
of
aiding
them
and
bettering
their
condition
of
giving
so
much
to
this
one
and
so
much
to
that
while
my
heart
thus
melted
within
me
i
divided
all
i
had
with
them
yes
even
what
i
had
not
and
i
say
this
to
my
confusion
for
god
perhaps
permitted
it
to
make
me
comprehend
the
value
of
the
evangelical
counsel
for
three
months
i
felt
this
importunate
longing
to
promote
the
interests
of
my
brothers
and
sisters
it
constantly
weighed
on
my
poor
heart
during
this
time
when
i
felt
a
little
relieved
i
prayed
god
to
deliver
me
from
this
temptation
and
persevered
so
long
in
my
prayer
that
at
length
he
had
pity
on
me
and
took
away
this
excessive
tenderness
for
my
relations
and
though
they
have
been
needy
and
still
are
the
good
god
has
given
me
the
grace
to
commit
them
to
his
providence
and
to
regard
them
as
better
off
than
if
they
were
in
an
easier
vincent
was
equally
rigid
as
to
his
own
personal
necessities
as
may
be
seen
by
the
following
words
from
his
own
lips
i
put
a
morsel
of
bread
to
my
mouth
i
say
to
myself
wretched
man
hast
thou
earned
the
bread
thou
art
going
to
eat
the
bread
that
comes
from
the
labor
of
the
poor
such
is
the
spirit
of
the
saints
in
these
days
when
most
people
are
struggling
to
rise
in
the
world
many
by
undue
means
and
to
an
unlawful
height
it
is
well
to
recall
this
holy
example
it
is
good
to
get
a
glimpse
into
the
heart
of
a
saint
and
to
remember
there
are
still
many
in
the
world
and
in
the
cloister
who
strive
to
counterbalance
all
this
ambition
and
love
of
display
by
their
humility
and
immediately
after
canonization
in
the
inhabitants
of
pouy
desirous
of
testifying
their
veneration
for
his
memory
removed
the
house
where
he
was
born
a
short
distance
from
its
original
place
without
changing
its
primitive
form
in
the
least
and
erected
a
small
chapel
on
the
site
till
means
could
be
obtained
for
building
a
church
the
great
revolution
put
a
stop
to
the
plan
in
a
new
effort
was
made
a
committee
appointed
and
a
subscription
begun
which
soon
amounted
to
thirty
thousand
francs
but
at
the
revolution
of
material
interests
prevailed
and
the
funds
were
appropriated
to
the
construction
of
roads
the
ecclesiastical
authorities
at
length
took
the
matter
in
hand
and
formed
the
plan
not
only
of
building
a
church
but
surrounding
it
with
the
various
charitable
institutions
founded
by
vincent
a
hospital
for
the
aged
asylums
for
orphans
and
foundlings
and
perhaps
a
in
the
landes
in
the
bishop
of
aire
appealed
to
the
catholic
world
for
aid
pius
ix
blessed
the
undertaking
on

laid
by
the
bishop
assisted
by
père
etienne
the
of
the
lazarists
napoleon
iii
and
the
empress
eugénie
largely
contributed
to
the
work
and
in
a
few
years
the
church
and
hospice
were
completed
the
consecration
took
place
april
in
the
presence
of
an
immense
multitude
from
all
parts
of
the
country
from
three
in
the
morning
there
were
masses
at
a
dozen
altars
and
the
hands
of
the
priests
were
fatigued
in
administering
the
holy
eucharist
among
the
communicants
were
eight
hundred
members
of
the
society
of
vincent
de
paul
from

who
manifested
their
joy
by
enthusiastic
hymns
at
eight
in
the
forenoon
père
etienne
surrounded
by
lazarists
and
sisters
of
charity
celebrated
the
holy
sacrifice
at
the
high
altar
and
several
novices
made
their
vows
among
whom
was
a
young
african
a
cousin
of
abdel
kader
a
containing
relics
of
vincent
was
brought
in
solemn
procession
from
the
parish
church
of
pouy
where
he
had
been
held
at
the
font
and
received
the
divine
guest
in
his
heart
for
the
first
time
the
road
was
strewn
with
flowers
and
green
leaves
the
weather
was
delightful
and
the
heavens
radiant
at
the
head
of
the
procession
was
borne
a
banner
on
which
vincent
was
represented
as
a
shepherd
followed
by
all
the
orphans
of
the
new
asylum
and
the
old
men
of
the
hospice
then
came
a
long
line
of
de
dressed
in
white
carrying
oriflammes
followed
by
the
students
of
the
colleges
of
aire
and
dax
behind
were
fifteen
hundred
members
of
the
society
of
vincent
de
paul
and
a
file
of
sisters
of
various
orders
including
eight
hundred
sisters
of
charity
with
a
great
number
of
lazarists
in
the
rear
then
came
thirty
relatives
of
vincent
wearing
the
costume
of
the
district
heirs
of
his
virtues
and
simplicity
then
the
polish
lazarists
with
the
flag
of
their
nation
beloved
by
vincent
and
after
them
the
clergy
of
the
diocese
and
a
great
number
from
foreign
parts
among
whom
was
eugène
boré
of
constantinople
now
of
the
two
orders
founded
by
the
saint
the
shrine
came
next
surrounded
by
lazarists
and
sisters
of
charity
behind
the
canons
and
other
dignitaries
came
eight
bishops
four
archbishops
and
cardinal
donnet
of
bordeaux
followed
by
the
civil
authorities
and
an
immense
multitude
of
people
nearly
two
miles
in
extent
with
banners
bearing
touching
devices
this
grand
procession
of
more
than
thirty
thousand
people
proceeded
with
the
utmost
order
to
the
sound
of
chants
instrumental
music
and
salutes
from
cannon
from
time
to
time
to
the
square
in
front
of
the
new
church
where
before
an
altar
erected
at
the
foot
of
oak
they
were
addressed
by
père
etienne
in
an
eloquent
thrilling
discourse
admirable
in
style
and
glowing
with
imagery
suited
to
the
fervid
nature
of
this
southern
region
he
spoke
of
vincent
not
only
as
the
man
of
his
age
with
a
providential
mission
but
of
a
type
suited
to
all
ages
the
man
who
loved
his
brethren
reconciled
enemies
brought
the
rich
and
poor
into
one
common
field
imbued
with
a
common
idea
of
sacrifice
and
devotion
fed
the
orphan
aided
the
needy
and
wiped
away
the
tears
of
the
sufferer
is
the
man
of
all
times
and
especially
of
an
age
marked
by
the
fomentation
of
political
passions
the
old
oak
was
gay
with
streamers
the
hollow
was
fitted
up
as
an
oratory
before
which
cardinal
donnet
said
mass
in
the
open
air
after
which
thousands
of
voices
joined
in
the
solemn
deum
and
the
thirteen
prelates
terminated
the
grand
ceremony
by
giving
their
united
benediction
to
the
kneeling
crowd
a
whole
flock
of
sisters
of
charity
with
their
plumage
of
white
and
gray
took
the
same
train
as
ourselves
the
pleasant
september
morning
we
left
bayonne
for
the
of
vincent
of
paul
they
seemed
like
birds
of
good
omen
they
were
also
going
to
the
cradle
as
they
called
it
not
on
a
mere
pilgrimage
but
to
make
their
annual
retreat
what
for
the
saints
alone
know
for
they
looked
like
the
personification
of
every
amiable
virtue
and
quite
ready
to
spread
their
white
wings
and
take
flight
for
heaven
it
was
refreshing
to
watch
their
gentle
unaffected
ways
wholly
devoid
of
those
demure
airs
of
superior
sanctity
and
repulsive
austerity
so
exasperating
to
us
people
they
all
made
the
sign
of
the
cross
as
the
train
moved
out
of
the
station
and
a
good
honest
one
it
was
as
if
they
loved
the
sign
of
the
son
of
man
and
delighted
in
wearing
it
on
their
breast
some
had
come
from
sebastian
others
from
jean
de
luz
and
several
from
bayonne
but
they
mingled
like
sisters
of
one
great
family
of
charity
some
chatted
some
took
out
their
rosaries
and
went
to
praying
with
the
most
cheerful
air
imaginable
as
if
it
were
a
new
refreshment
just
allowed
them
instead
of
being
the
daily
food
of
their
souls
and
others
seemed
to
be
studying
with
interest
the
peculiar
region
we
were
now
entering
for
we
were
now
in
the
landes
low
level
monotonous
and
melancholy
the
railway
lay
through
vast
forests
of
varied
by
willows
and
with
here
and
there
at
long
distances
an
open
tract
where
ripened
scanty
fields
of
corn
and
millet
around
the
low
cottages
of
the
peasants
the
sides
of
the
road
were
purple
with
heather
the
air
was
full
of
aromatic
odors
each
pine
had
its
broad
gash
cut
by
some
merciless
hand
and
its
was
slowly
trickling
down
its
side
passing
through
this
sad
forest
one
could
not
help
thinking
of
the
drear
mystic
wood
in
where
every
tree
encloses
a
human
soul
with
infinite
capacity
of
suffering
and
at
every
gash
cut
every
branch
lopped
off
utters
a
despairing
cry
thou
me
then
as
the
dark
blood
trickled
down
its
side
these
words
it
added
wherefore
me
thus
is
there
no
touch
of
mercy
in
thy
breast
men
once
were
we
that
now
are
rooted
though
the
sun
was
hot
the
pine
needles
seemed
to
shiver
the
branches
swayed
to
and
fro
in
the
air
and
gave
out
a
kind
of
sigh
which
sometimes
increased
into
an
inarticulate
wail
we
look
up
almost
expecting
to
see
the
harpies
sitting
on
the
wild
thorn
of
his
wretched
could
we
stop
we
might
question
these
maimed
trees
and
learn
some
fearful
tragedy
from
the
imprisoned
spirits
perhaps
they
recount
them
to
each
other
in
the
wild
winter
nights
when
the
peasants
listening
with
a
kind
of
fear
in
their
lone
huts
start
up
from
their
beds
and
say
it
is
rey
artus
king
arthur
who
is
passing
by
with
his
long
train
of
dogs
horses
and
huntsmen
from
an
old
legend
of
the
time
of
the
english
occupation
which
says
that
king
arthur
as
he
was
hearing
mass
on
attracted
by
the
cries
of
his
hounds
attacking
their
prey
went
out
at
the
elevation
of
the
host
a
whirlwind
carried
him
into
the
clouds
where
he
has
hunted
ever
since
and
will
without
cessation
or
repose
till
the
day
of
judgment
only
taking
a
fly
every
seven
years
the
popular
belief
that
he
is
passing
with
a
great
noise
through
space
when
the
winds
sweep
across
the
vast
moors
on
stormy
nights
probably
embodies
the
old
tradition
of
some
powerful
lord
whose
hounds
and
huntsmen
ruined
the
crops
of
the
poor
who
in
their
wrath
consigned
them
to
endless
barren
in
the
a
legend
which
reminds
us
of
the
of
whom
miss
bremer
tells
us
spirits
not
good
enough
to
merit
heaven
and
yet
not
bad
enough
to
deserve
hell
and
are
therefore
doomed
to
ride
about
till
the
end
of
the
world
carrying
fear
and
disaster
in
their
train
in
a
little
over
an
hour
we
arrived
at
dax
a
pleasant
town
on
the
banks
of
the
adour
with
long
lines
of
sycamores
behind
which
is
a
hill
crowned
with
an
old
château
now
belonging
to
the
lazarists

place

renowned
for
its

episcopal
see
before
the
revolution
of
françois
de
noailles
one
of
the
most
distinguished
of
its
bishops
was
famous
as
a
diplomatist
in
the
xvith
century
he
was
sent
to
england
on
several
important
missions
and
finally
appointed
ambassador
to
that
country
in
the
reign
of
mary
tudor
recalled
when
philip
ii
induced
her
to
declare
war
against
france
he
landed
at
calais
and
carefully
examining
the
fortifications
his
keen
observant
eye
soon
discovered
the
weak
point
to
which
at
his
arrival
in
court
he
at
once
directed
the
attention
declaring
it
would
not
be
a
difficult
matter
to
take
the
place
his
statements
made
such
an
impression
on
king
henry
who
had
always
found
him
as
judicious
as
he
was
devoted
to
the
interests
of
the
crown
that
he
resolved
to
lay
siege
to

opposition
of

ministers

who
married

of

wrote
françois
de
noailles
as
follows
one
can
help
acknowledging
the
great
hand
you
had
in
the
taking
of
calais
as
it
was
actually
taken
at
the
very
place
you
pointed
french
historians
have
been
too
forgetful
of
the
hand
the
bishop
of
dax
had
in
the
taking
of
a
place
so
important
to
the
interests
of
the
nation
which
added
so
much
to
the
glory
of
the
french
arms
and
was
so
humiliating
to
england
whose
anguish
was
echoed
by
the
queen
when
she
exclaimed
that
if
her
heart
could
be
opened
the
very
name
of
calais
would
be
found
written
therein
this
great
churchman
was
no
less
successful
in
his
embassy
to
venice
where
he
triumphed
over
the
haughty
pretensions
of
philip
and
as
brantôme
says
great
honor
and
after
five
years
in
italy
he
returned
to
dax
where
he
devoted
most
of
his
revenues
to
relieve
the
misery
that
prevailed
at
that
fearful
time
of
religious
war
dax
as
he
said
was
poorest
see
in
in
he
was
appointed
ambassador
to
constantinople
by
charles
ix
florimond
de
raymond
an
old
writer
of
that
day
tells
us
the
bishop
was
at
first
troubled
as
to
his
presentation
to
the
sultan
who
only
regarded
the
highest
dignitaries
as
the
dust
of
his
feet
and
exacted
ceremonies
which
the
ambassador
considered
beneath
the
dignity
of
a
bishop
and
a
representative
of
france
he
resolved
not
to
submit
to
them
and
thanks
to
his
pleasing
address
and
handsome
person
dressed
for
the
occasion
in
red
and
cloth
of
gold
he
was
not
subjected
to
them
moreover
by
his
fascinating
manners
and
agreeable
conversation
he
became
a
great
favorite
of
the
sultan
and
took
so
judicious
a
course
that
his
embassy
ended
by
rendering
france
mistress
of
the
commerce
of
the
mediterranean
and
giving
her
a
in
the
east
which
she
has
never
lost
it
was
after
his
return
from
the
levant
that
in
an
interview
with
henry
the
sagacious
bishop
urged
the
king
to
declare
war
against
spain
as
the
best
means
of
delivering
france
from
the
horrors
of
a
civil
war
de
thou
says
the
king
seemed
to
listen
favorably
to
the
suggestion
but
it
was
opposed
by
the
council
and
it
was
not
till
ten
years
later
that
henry
iv
declared
war
against
that
country
as
duruy
states
better
to
end
the
civil
the
bishop
of
dax
seems
to
have
been
poorly
remunerated
for
his
eminent
services
like
frederick
the
father
he
said
kings
were
always
hard
of
hearing
when
there
was
a
question
of
money
and
complained
that
notwithstanding
his
long
services
abroad
he
had
never
received
either
honors
or
profit
even
his
appointments
as
ambassador
to
venice
amounting
to
more
than
thirty
thousand
livres
were
still
due
many
of
his
letters
to
the
king
and
to
marie
de
médicis
have
been
preserved
which
show
his
elevation
of
mind
and
his
broad
political
and
religious
views
which
give
him
a
right
to
be
numbered
among
the
great
churchmen
of
the
xvith
century
at
dax
we
took
a
carriage
to
the
of
vincent
and
after
half
an
drive
along
a
level
road
bordered
with
trees
we
came
in
sight
of
the
great
dome
of
the
church
rising
up
amid
a
group
of
fine
buildings
driving
up
to
the
door
the
first
thing
we
observed
was
the
benign
statue
of
the
saint
standing
on
the
gable
against
the
clear
blue
sky
with
arms
smiling
on
the
pilgrim
a
very
balm
of
peace
before
the
church
there
is
a
broad
green
at
the
right
of
which
is
the
venerable
old
oak
at
the
left
the
cottage
of
the
de
pauls
and
in
the
rear
of
the
church
the
asylums
and
hospice
fine
establishments
one
is
surprised
to
find
in
this
remote
region
we
at
once
entered
the
church
which
is
in
the
style
of
the
renaissance
it
consists
of
a
nave
without
aisles
a
circular
apsis
and
transepts
which
form
the
arms
of
the
cross
in
the
centre
of
which
rises
the
dome
lined
with
an
indifferent
fresco
representing
vincent
borne
to
heaven
by
the
angels
directly
beneath
is
the
high
altar
where
are
enshrined
relics
of
the
saint
around
it
at
the
four
angles
of
the
cross
are
statues
of
four
vincents
of
xaintes
of
saragossa
of
lerins
and
vincent
ferrer
the
whole
life
of
vincent
of
paul
is
depicted
in
the
windows
and
on
the
walls
of
the
nave
are
four
paintings
one
representing
him
as
a
boy
praying
before
our
lady
of
buglose
the
second
his
first
mass
in
the
chapel
of
notre
dame
de
grâce
in
the
third
he
is
redeeming
captives
and
in
the
fourth
giving
alms
to
the
poor
we
next
visited
the
asylums
admiring
the
clean
airy
rooms
the
intelligent
happy
faces
of
the
orphans
and
the
graceful
cordiality
of
the
sister
who
was
at
the
head
of
the
establishment
a
lady
of
fortune
who
has
devoted
her
all
to
the
work
at
length
we
came
to
the
cottage
the
door
of
the
true
hero
to
which
our
path
had
led
the
broad
house
in
which
vincent
was
born
is
now
a
mere
skeleton
within
the
framework
of
the
partitions
alone
remaining
so
one
can
take
in
the
whole
at
a
glance
there
is
the
kitchen
with
the
huge
chimney
around
which
the
family
used
to
gather
so
enormous
that
in
looking
up
one
sees
a
vast
extent
of
blue
sky
house
though
it
was
we
could
not
help
thinking
heaven
forgive
us
the
profane
thought
it
must
have
been
very
much
like
the
chimney
in
the
draught
of
which
like
the
polish
game
of
draughts
was
apt
to
take
backwards
and
discharge
all
the
smoke
into
his
the
second
room
at
the
left
where
the
saint
was
born
is
an
oratory
containing
an
altar
the
crucifix
he
used
to
pray
before
some
of
the
garments
he
wore
shoes
broad
and
as
his
own
nature
and
many
other
precious
relics
not
only
this
but
every
room
has
an
altar
we
counted
seven
all
of
the
simplest
construction
for
the
convenience
of
the
pilgrims
who
come
here
with
their
at
certain
seasons
of
the
year
to
honor
their
sainted
countryman
who
in
his
youth
here
led
a
simple
laborious
life
like
themselves
we
found
several
persons
at
prayer
in
the
various
compartments
all
of
which
showed
the
primitive
habits
and
limited
resources
of
the
family
though
not
absolute
poverty
the
floor
was
of
earth
the
walls
and
great
rafters
only
polished
with
time
and
the
kisses
of
the
pilgrims
and
above
the
rude
stairway
a
mere
loft
where
perchance
the
saint
slept
in
his
boyhood
everything
in
this
cottage
where
a
great
heart
was
cradled
was
from
its
very
simplicity
extremely
touching
it
seemed
the
very
place
to
meditate
on
the
mysterious
ways
of
divine
providence
mysterious
as
the
wind
that
bloweth
where
it
listeth
the
very
place
to
chant
the

oak
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
green
looks
old
enough
to
have
witnessed
the
mysterious
rites
of
the
druids
it
is
surrounded
by
a
railing
to
protect
it
from
the
pious
depredations
of
the
pilgrim
it
still
spreads
broad
its
branches
covered
with
verdure
though
the
trunk
is
so
hollowed
by
decay
that
one
side
is
entirely
gone
and
in
the
heart
where
young
vincent
used
to
pray
stands
a
wooden
pillar
on
which
is
a
statue
of
the
virgin
pure
and
white
beneath
the
green
bower
a
crowd
of
artists
soldiers
and
princes
have
bent
before
this
venerable
tree
in
the
public
authorities
of
the

the
duchess
of
angoulême
at
its
foot
the
learned
and
pious
ozanam
one
of
the
founders
of
the
society
of
vincent
of
paul
came
here
in
his
last
days
to
offer
a
prayer
on
the
list
of
foreign
visitors
is
the
name
of
the
late
venerable
bishop
flaget
of
kentucky
of
whom
it
is
recorded
that
he
kissed
the
tree
with
love
and
veneration
and
plucked
as
every
pilgrim
does
a
leaf
from
its
branches
there
is
an
herb
says
pliny
found
on
mt
atlas
they
who
gather
it
see
more
clearly
there
is
something
of
this
virtue
in
the
oak
of
vincent
of
paul
one
sees
more
clearly
than
ever
at
its
foot
the
infinite
moral
superiority
of
a
nature
like
his
to
the
worldly
ambition
of
the
old
lords
of
the
landes
famous
as
the
latter
were
in
their
day
who
thinks
of
them
now
who
cares
for
the
lords
of
castelnau
the
seigneurs
of
juliac
or
even
for
the
sires
of
albret
whose
ancient
castle
at
labrit
is
now
razed
to
the
ground
and
while
we
write
its
last
traces
obliterated
for
ever
the
shepherd
whistles
idly
among
the
ruins
of
their
once
strong
holds
the
ploughman
drives
thoughtlessly
over
the
place
where
they
once
held
proud
sway
as
indifferent
as
the
beasts
themselves
but
there
is
not
a
peasant
in
the
landes
who
does
not
cherish
the
memory
of
vincent
of
paul
or
a
noble
who
does
not
respect
his
name
and
thousands
annually
visit
the
poor
house
where
he
was
born
and
look
with
veneration
at
the
oak
where
he
prayed
charity
is
the
great
means
of
making
the
poor
forget
the
fearful
inequality
of
worldly
riches
and
its
obligation
reminds
the
wealthy
they
are
only
part
of
a
great
brotherhood
its
exercise
softens
the
heart
and
averts
the
woe
pronounced
on
the
rich
john
of
god
wishing
to
found
a
hospital
at
granada
and
without
a
ducat
in
the
world
walked
slowly
through
the
streets
and
squares
with
a
hod
on
his
back
and
two
great
kettles
at
his
side
crying
with
a
loud
voice
wishes
to
do
good
to
himself
ah
my
brethren
for
the
love
of
god
do
good
to
yourselves
and
alms
flowed
in
from
every
side
it
was
these
appeals
in
the
divine
name
that
gave
him
his
appellation
is
your
name
asked
don
ramirez
bishop
of
tuy
was
the
reply
you
shall
be
called
john
of
god
said
the
bishop
and
so
that
we
may
all
become
the
sons
of
god
let
us
here
at
the
foot
of
oak
echo
the
words
that
in
life
were
so
often
on
his
lips
caritatem
propter
deum
lord
memoirs
in
the
year
the
earl
of
castlehaven
then
a
young
man
made
the
grand
tour
as
became
a
nobleman
of
his
family
in
that
age
being
at
rome
whither
the
duty
of
paying
his
respects
to
the
holy
father
had
carried
him
for
this
lord
was
the
head
of
one
of
those
grand
old
families
which
had
declined
to
forswear
its
faith
at
the
behest
of
henry
or
elizabeth
he
received
a
letter
from
king
charles
requiring
him
to
attend
the
king
in
his
expedition
against
the
scots
then
revolted
and
in
arms
with
that
instant
loyalty
which
was
the
return
made
by
those
proscribed
families
to
an
ungrateful
court
from
the
armada
down
lord
castlehaven
two
days
after
the
messenger
had
placed
the
royal
missive
in
his
hands
took
post
for
england
near
turin
he
fell
in
with
an
army
commanded
by
the
marquis
de
leganes
governor
of
milan
for
the
king
of
spain
who
was
marching
to
besiege
the
savoy
capital
but
the
siege
was
soon
raised
and
lord
castlehaven
entered
the
town
there
he
found
her
royal
highness
the
duchess
of
savoy
in
great
confusion
as
if
she
had
got
no
rest
for
many
nights
so
much
had
she
been
occupied
with
the
conduct
of
the
defence
for
even
the
wives
of
this
warlike
and
rapacious
family
soon
learned
to
defend
their
own
by
the
strong
hand
and
could
stretch
it
out
to
grasp
still
more
when
occasion
served
but
as
yet
the
ambition
of
the
house
of
savoy
stopped
short
of
sacrilege
or
stooped
to
it
like
a
hawk
on
short
flights
nor
dreamed
of
aggrandizing
itself
with
the
spoils
of
the
whole
territory
of
the
church
when
lord
castlehaven
came
to
take
leave
of

her
royal
highness
gave
him
a
much
battered
which
had
come
in
at
her
window
and
missed
her
narrowly
charging
him
to
deliver
it
safely
to
her
sister
the
queen
of
england
as
it
proved
a
present
of
ill
omen
for
of
in
a
little
time
the
english
sister
had
more
than
enough
arriving
in
london
lord
castlehaven
followed
the
king
to
berwick
where
he
found
the
royal
army
encamped
with
the
tweed
before
it
and
the
scotch
under
leslie
lying
at
some
distance
a
pacification
was
soon
effected
and
both
armies
partially
disbanded
after
this
the
earl
passed
his
time
well
as
he
at
home
till
in
that
year
the
king
of
france
besieged
arras
and
lord
castlehaven
set
out
to
witness
the
siege
within
was
a
stout
garrison
under
owen
roe
commanding
for
the
prince
cardinal
governor
of
the
low
countries
this
was
the
first
meeting
of
castlehaven
with
the
future
victor
of
benburb
with
whom
he
was
afterwards
brought
into
closer
relations
in
the
irish
rebellion
the
french
pressed
arras
close
and
the
confederates
being
defeated
and
the
hope
of
the
siege
being
raised
grown
desperate
the
town
was
surrendered
on
honorable
terms
this
action
over
lord
castlehaven
returned
to
england
and
sat
in
parliament
till
the
attainder
of
the
earl
of
strafford
when
that
great
nobleman
fell
deserted
by
his
wavering
royal
master
and
the
friends
were
beginning
to
turn
about
they
scarce
knew
whither
to
prepare
for
the
storm
that
all
men
saw
was
coming
lord
castlehaven
went
to
ireland
where
he
had
some
estate
and
three
married
sisters
while
there
the
rebellion
of
broke
out
although
innocent
of
any
complicity
in
the
outbreak
his
faith
made
him
suspected
and
he
was
imprisoned
on
a
slight
pretext
by
the
escaping
his
first
design
was
to
get
into
france
and
thence
to
england
to
join
the
king
at
york
and
petition
for
a
trial
by
his
peers
but
coming
to
kilkenny
he
found
there
the
supreme
council
of
the
confederate
catholics
just
assembled
many
of
them
being
of
his
acquaintance
and
was
persuaded
by
them
to
throw
in
his
lot
with
theirs
seeing
as
they
truly
told
him
that
they
were
all
persecuted
on
the
same
score
and
ruined
so
that
they
had
nothing
more
to
lose
but
their
lives
from
that
time
till
the
peace
of
he
was
engaged
in
the
war
of
the
confederate
catholics
holding
important
commands
in
the
field
under
the
supreme
council
his
is
the
history
of
this
war
after
the
peace
of
concluded
with
the
marquis
of
ormond
the
but
which
shortly
fell
through
lord
castlehaven
retired
to
france
and
served
as
a
volunteer
under
prince
rupert
at
the
siege
of
landrecies
then
returning
to
paris
he
remained
in
attendance
on
the
queen
of
england
and
the
prince
of
wales
charles
ii
at
germain
till
in
that
year
he
returned
to
ireland
with
the
the
marquis
of

served
the
royal
cause
in
that
kingdom
against
the
parliamentary
forces
under
ireton
and
cromwell
the
battle
of
worcester

lost
and
cromwell
the
undisputed
master
of
the
three

castlehaven
again
followed
the
clouded
fortunes
of
charles
ii
to
france
there
he
obtained
permission
to
join
the
great
condé
in
the
campaigns
under
that
prince
he
had
the
command
of
eight
or
nine
regiments
of
irish
troops
making
altogether
a
force
of
men
thus
we
find
the
irish
refugees
already
consolidated
into
a
brigade
some
years
before
the
treaty
of
limerick
expatriated
those
soldiers
whose
valor
is
more
commonly
identified
with
that
title
lord
castlehaven
returned
to
england
at
the
restoration
in
the

with
holland
he
served
as
a
volunteer
in
some
of
the
naval
engagements
in
the
french
having
invaded
flanders
he
was
ordered
there
with
men
to
recruit
the
english

he
was
made

the

this

till
the
breaking
out
in
of

bloody

and
the
confederate
spaniards
and
imperialists
on
the
one
side
and

after
forty
hard

this
veteran
retired
from

field
and
returning
to
england
like
another
cæsar
set
about
writing
his
commentaries
on
the
wars
thus
he
spent
his
remaining
years
first
he
published
but
without
acknowledging
the
authorship
his
of
the
irish
this
first
edition
was
suppressed
then
in
appeared
the
second
edition
containing
besides
the
his
being
an
account
of
his
continental
service
his
on
confederate
armies
and
the
conduct
of
war
and
a
which
is
a
reply
to
the
earl
of
anglesey
and
right
well
has
the
modern
reader
reason
to
be
thankful
for
his
literary
spirit
his
is
one
of
the
most
authentic
and
trustworthy
accounts
we
have
of
that
vexed
passage
of
irish
history
the
rebellion
of
its
blunt
frankness
is
its
greatest
charm
it
has
the
value
of
an
account
by
an
actor
in
the
scenes
described
and
it
possesses
that
merit
of
impartiality
which
comes
of
being
written
by
an
englishman
who
connected
with
the
irish
leaders
by
the
ties
of
faith
family
and
property
and
sympathizing
fully
with
their
efforts
to
obtain
redress
for
flagrant
wrongs
was
yet
not
blind
to
their
mistakes
and
indefensible
actions
castlehaven
neglected
for
more
than
a
century
has
received
more
justice
at
the
hands
of
later
historians
he
is
frequently
referred
to
by
lingard
and
his
work
will
be
found
an
admirable
commentary
on
of
there
is
a
notice
of
him
in
horace
of
royal
and
noble
vol
iii
this
lord
says
walpole
led
a
very
martial
life
had
not
taken
the
pains
to
record
his
own
actions
which
however
he
has
done
with
great
frankness
and
ingenuity
we
should
know
little
of
his
story
our
historians
scarce
mentioning
him
and
even
our
writers
of
anecdotes
as
burnet
or
of
tales
and
circumstances
as
roger
north
not
giving
any
account
of
a
court
quarrel
occasioned
by
his
anthony
wood
alone
has
preserved
this
event
but
has
not
made
it
intelligible
the
earl
had
been
much
censured
for
his
share
in
the
irish
rebellion
and
wrote
the
to
explain
his
conduct
rather
than
to
excuse
it
for
he
freely
confesses
his
faults
and
imputes
them
to
provocations
from
the
government
of
that
kingdom
to
whose
rashness
and
cruelty
conjointly
with
the
votes
and
resolutions
of
the
english
parliament
he
ascribes
the
massacre
there
are
no
dates
nor
method
and
less
style
in
these
defects
atoned
for
in
some
measure
by
a
martial
honesty
soon
after
their
publication
the
earl
of
anglesey
wrote
to
ask
a
copy
lord
castlehaven
sent
him
one
but
denying
the
work
as
his
anglesey
who
had
been
a
commissioner
in
ireland
for
the
parliament
published
letter
with
observations
and
reflections
very
abusive
of
the
duke
of
ormond
which
occasioned
first
a
printed
controversy
and
this
a
trial
before
the
privy
council
the
event
of
which
was
that
first
letter
was
voted
a
scandalous
libel
and
himself
removed
from
the
custody
of
the
privy
seal
and
that
the
earl
of
on
which
he
was
several
times
examined
and
which
he
owned
was
declared
a
scandalous
libel
on
the
government
a
censure
that
seems
very
little
founded
there
is
not
a
word
that
can
authorize
that
sentence
from
the
council
of
charles
ii
but
the
imputation
on
the
of
charles
for
i
suppose
the
privy
council
did
not
pique
themselves
on
vindicating
the
honor
of
the
republican
parliament
bishop
morley
wrote
true
account
of
the
whole
proceeding
between
james
duke
of
ormond
and
arthur
earl
of
immediately
after
the
restoration
as
it
is
well
known
an
act
was
passed
commonly
called
in
that
age
act
of
oblivion
by
which
all
penalties
except
certain
specified
ones
incurred
in
the
late
troublous
and
rebellious
times
were
forgiven
so
superfine
would
have
been
the
net
which
the
law
of
treason
would
have
drawn
around
the
three
kingdoms
had
its
strict
construction
been
enforced
that
it
was
quite
cut
loose
a
few
only
of
the
greatest
criminals
and
regicides
being
held
in
its
meshes
so
harsh
had
been
iron
rule
that
there
were
few
counties
of
england
in
which
the
stoutest
squires
and
even
the
most
loyal
might
not
have
trembled
had
the
commission
inquired
too
closely
into
the
legal
question
of
connivance
at
the
late
rule
and
in
the
great
cities
london
especially
the
tide
of
enthusiasm
which
now
ran
so
strongly
for
the
king
could
not
hide
the
memory
of
those
days
when
the
same
fierce
crowds
had
clamored
for
the
head
of
the
prudent
it
was
as
well
as
benign
therefore
for
the
to
let
time
roll
smoothly
over
past
transgressions
but
though
the
law
might
grant
oblivion
and
even
punish
the
revival
of
controversies
the
old
rancor
between
individuals
and
even
parties
was
not
so
easily
appeased
after
the
first
joyful
outburst
books
and
pamphlets
by
the
hundred
brought
charges
and
counter
charges
but
these
of
slander
and
lyes
as
castlehaven
calls
them
outdid
themselves
in
their
tragical
stories
of
the
irish
rebellion
of
nor
have
imitators
been
wanting
in
this
age
as
rancorous
and
more
skilful
in
the
production
of
and
invectives
to
traduce
a
whole
to
answer
those
calumnies
by
forth
the
truth
of
his
story
in
a
brief
and
plain
was
the
design
of
work
then
as
now
it
was
the
aim
of
the
libellers
of
the
irish
people
to
make
the
whole
nation
accountable
for
the
so
called
of
and
to
confound
the
war
of
the
confederate
catholics
and
the
later
loyal
resistance
to
cromwell
in
one
common
denunciation
with
the
first
sanguinary
and
criminal
outbreak
lord
narrative
effectually
disposes
of
this
charge
in
a
singularly
clear
and
candid
manner
he
narrates
the
rise
and
progress
of
the
insurrection
and
shows
the
wide
difference
between
the
aims
and
motives
of
those
who
planned
the
uprising
of
october
and
of
those
who
afterwards
carried
on
the
war
under
the
title
of
the
confederate
catholics
of
ireland
the
former
he
does
not
hesitate
to
denounce
as
a
and
conspiracy
but
the
responsibility
for
it
he
fixes
in
the
right
quarter
the
malevolent
character
of
the
irish
government
and
the
atrocious
spirit
of
the
english
puritan
parliament
which
abandoning
all
the
duties
of
protection
kept
only
one
object
in
view
the
extirpation
of
the
native
irish
with
the
successful
example
of
the
scotch
rebellion
immediately
before
them
it
was
a
matter
of
little
wonder
to
observant
and
impartial
minds
in
that
age
that
the
irish
should
have
seized
upon
the
occasion
of
the
growing
quarrel
between
the
king
and
parliament
as
the
opportune
moment
for
the
redress
of
their
grievances
for
in
the
year
two
years
after
the
pacification
of
berwick
the
scotch
rebellion
primarily
instigated
by
the
same
cause
as
the
irish
religious
differences
broke
out
with
greater
violence
than
ever
the
army
invaded
england
defeated
the
troops
at
newburn
and
took
newcastle
then
driven
to
extremity
by
those
scotch
rebels
as
mercenary
as
they
were
fanatical
and
his
strength
paralyzed
by
the
growing
english
sedition
charles
called
together
unfortunate
which
proceeding
from
one
violence
to
another
first
destroyed
its
master
and
then
was
in
turn
destroyed
by
its
own
servant
far
from
voting
the
scotch
army
rebels
and
traitors
the
parliament
at
once
styled
them
and
voted
them
for
their
kindness
gervase
holles
was
expelled
from
the
house
for
saying
in
the
course
of
debate
the
best
way
of
paying
them
was
by
arms
to
expel
them
out
of
the
the
quarrel
between
king
and
commons
grew
hotter
until
finally
it
became
evident
that
notwithstanding
concessions
a
violent
rupture
could
not
be
long
delayed
no
fairer
opportunity
could
be
hoped
for
by
the
irish
leaders
dissatisfied
with
their
own
condition
and
spurred
on
by
the
hope
of
winning
as
good
measure
of
success
as
the
scotch
the
plan
to
surprise
the
castle
of
dublin
and
the
other
english
garrisons
was
quickly
matured
but
failing
some
of
the
conspirators
were
taken
and
executed
and
the
rest
forced
to
retire
to
the
woods
and
mountains
but
the
flame
thus
lighted
soon
spread
over
the
whole
kingdom
and
occasioned
a
war
which
lasted
without
intermission
for
ten
years
the
following
reasons
are
declared
by
castlehaven
to
have
been
afterwards
offered
to
him
by
the
irish
as
the
explanation
of
this
insurrection
first
that
being
constantly
looked
upon
by
the
english
government
as
a
conquered
nation
and
never
treated
as
natural
or
subjects
they
considered
themselves
entitled
to
regain
their
liberty
whenever
they
believed
it
to
be
in
their
power
to
do
so
secondly
that
in
the
north
where
the
insurrection
broke
out
with
the
greatest
violence
six
whole
counties
had
been
escheated
to
the
crown
at
one
blow
on
account
of
rebellion
and
although
it
was
shown
that
a
large
portion
of
the
population
of
those
counties
was
innocent
of
complicity
in
that
rising
nothing
had
ever
been
restored
but
the
whole
bestowed
by
james
upon
his
countrymen
to
us
who
live
at
the
distance
of
two
centuries
and
a
half
from
those
days
of
wholesale
rapine
these
confiscations
still
seem
the
most
gigantic
instance
of
english
wrong
but
who
shall
tell
their
maddening
effect
upon
those
who
suffered
from
them
in
person
in
that
age
the
men
flying
to
the
mountains
the
women
perishing
in
the
fields
the
children
crying
for
food
they
could
not
get
thirdly
the
popular
alarm
was
heightened
by
the
reports
current
during
government
in
ireland
that
the
counties
of
roscommon
mayo
galway
and
cork
and
parts
of
tipperary
limerick
and
wicklow
were
to
share
the
fate
of
the
ulster
counties
it
hardly
needs
the
example
of
our
own
revolution
to
prove
the
truth
of
observation
upon
this
project
experience
tells
us
where
the
property
is
like
to
be
invaded
neither
religion
nor
loyalty
is
able
to
keep
them
within
bounds
if
they
find
themselves
in
a
condition
to
make
any
considerable
and
this
brings
to
his
mind
the
story
related
by
livy
of
those
resolute
ambassadors
of
the
privernates
who
being
reduced
to
such
extremities
that
they
were
obliged
to
beg
peace
of
the
roman
senate
yet
being
asked
what
peace
should
the
romans
expect
from
them
who
had
broken
it
so
often
they
boldly
answered
which
made
the
senate
accept
their
proposals
a
good
one
it
shall
be
faithful
and
lasting
but
if
bad
it
shall
not
hold
very
long
for
think
not
said
they
any
people
or
even
any
man
will
continue
in
that
condition
whereof
they
are
weary
any
longer
than
of
necessity
they
fourthly
it
was
notorious
that
from
the
moment
parliament
was
convened
it
had
urged
the
greatest
severities
against
the
english
roman
catholics
the
king
was
compelled
to
revive
the
penalties
of
the
worst
days
of
edward
and
elizabeth
against
them
his
own
consort
was
scarce
safe
from
the
violence
of
those
hideous
wretches
who
concealed
the
vilest
crimes
under
the
garb
of
puritan
godliness
readers
even
of
such
a
common
and
book
as
of
sir
john
will
be
surprised
to
find
the
prominence
and
space
the
resolutions
and
debates
occupied
in
the
sittings
of
parliament
the
popular
leaders
divided
their
time
nearly
equally
between
the
persecution
of
the
catholics
and
assaults
upon
the
prerogative
the
same
severities
were
now
threatened
against
the
irish
catholics
houses
says
castlehaven
by
several
petitions
out
of
ireland
to
have
those
of
that
kingdom
treated
with
the
like
rigor
which
to
a
people
so
fond
of
their
religion
as
the
irish
was
no
small
inducement
to
make
them
while
there
was
an
opportunity
offered
to
stand
upon
their
fifthly
the
precedent
of
the
scotch
rebellion
and
its
successful
results
pecuniarily
politically
and
religiously
encouraged
the
irish
so
much
at
that
time
that
they
offered
it
to
owen
as
their
chief
motive
for
rising
in
rebellion
says
he
quoted
by
castlehaven
engaged
in
to
be
rid
of
the
tyrannical
government
that
was
over
them
and
to
imitate
scotland
who
by
that
course
had
enlarged
their
october
of
the
irish
to
the
same
purpose
lord
castlehaven
quotes
howell
in
his
in
the
year
words
because
an
impartial
author
and
a
known
protestant
i
will
here
transcribe
in
confirmation
of
what
i
have
said
and
for
the
further
says
howell
the
irish
entered
into
consideration
that
they
had
sundry
grievances
and
grounds
of
complaint
both
touching
their
estates
and
consciences
which
they
pretended
to
be
far
greater
than
those
of
the
scots
for
they
fell
to
think
that
if
the
scot
was
suffered
to
introduce
a
new
religion
it
was
reason
they
should
not
be
punished
in
the
exercise
of
their
old
which
they
glory
never
to
have
altered
and
for
temporal
matters
wherein
the
scot
had
no
grievance
at
all
to
speak
of
the
new
plantations
which
had
been
lately
afoot
to
be
made
in
connaught
and
other
places
the
concealed
lands
and
defective
titles
which
were
daily
found
out
the
new
customs
which
were
enforced
and
the
incapacity
they
had
to
any
preferment
or
office
in
church
or
state
with
other
things
they
considered
to
be
grievances
of
a
far
greater
nature
and
that
deserved
redress
much
more
than
any
the
scot
had
to
this
end
they
sent
over
commissioners
to
attend
this
parliament
in
england
with
certain
propositions
but
they
were
dismissed
hence
with
a
short
and
unsavory
answer
which
bred
worse
blood
in
the
nation
than
was
formerly
gathered
and
this
with
that
leading
case
of
the
scot
may
be
said
to
be
the
first
incitements
that
made
them
lastly
that
army
of
men
which
the
earl
of
strafford
had
raised
to
be
transported
into
england
for
suppressing
the
scot
being
by
the
advice
of
our
parliament
here
disbanded
the
country
was
annoyed
by
some
of
those
straggling
soldiers
therefore
the
ambassadors
from
spain
having
propounded
to
have
some
numbers
of
those
disbanded
soldiers
for
the
service
of
their
master
his
majesty
by
the
mature
advice
of
his
privy
council
to
occur
the
mischiefs
that
might
arise
to
his
kingdom
of
ireland
from
those
loose
cashiered
soldiers
yielded
to
the
motion
but
as
they
were
in
the
height
of
that
work
providing
transports
there
was
a
sudden
stop
made
of
those
promised
troops
and
this
was
the
last
though
not
the
least
fatal
cause
of
that
horrid
insurrection
of
these
premises
it
is
easy
for
any
common
understanding
not
transported
with
passion
or
private
interest
to
draw
this
conclusion
that
they
who
complied
with
the
scot
in
his
insurrection
they
who
dismissed
the
irish
commissioners
with
such
a
short
impolitic
answer
they
who
took
off
the
earl
of
head
and
afterwards
delayed
the
despatching
of
the
earl
of
leicester
they
who
hindered
those
disbanded
troops
in
ireland
to
go
for
spain
may
be
justly
said
to
have
been
the
true
causes
of
the
late
insurrection
of
the
irish
continues
castlehaven
this
learned
and
ingenious
gentleman
who
as
being
then
his
historiographer
was
as
likely
as
any
man
to
know
the
transactions
of
those
times
and
as
an
englishman
and
a
loyal
protestant
was
beyond
all
exception
of
partiality
or
favor
of
the
papists
of
ireland
and
therefore
could
have
no
other
reason
but
the
love
of
truth
and
justice
to
give
this
account
of
the
irish
rebellion
or
make
the
scotch
and
their
wicked
brethren
in
the
parliament
of
england
the
main
occasion
of
that
horrid
as
for
the
so
called
that
ensued
lord
castlehaven
speaks
of
it
with
the
abhorrence
it
deserves
but
this
very
term
is
a
misnomer
plausibly
affixed
to
the
uprising
by
english
ingenuity
in
a
country
such
as
ireland
then
was
in
which
though
nominally
conquered
few
english
lived
outside
the
walled
towns
an
intermittent
state
of
war
was
chronic
and
therefore
there
was
none
of
that
unpreparedness
for
attack
or
absence
of
means
of
defence
on
the
part
of
the
english
settlers
which
in
other
historical
cases
has
rightfully
given
the
name
of
to
a
premeditated
murderous
attack
upon
defenceless
and
surprised
victims
to
hold
the
english
as
such
will
be
regarded
with
contemptuous
ridicule
by
every
one
acquainted
with
the
system
of
english
and
scotch
colonization
in
ireland
in
that
age
the
truth
is
the
cruelties
on
both
sides
were
very
bloody
though
some
says
lord
castlehaven
throw
all
upon
the
irish
yet
well
known
who
they
were
that
used
to
give
orders
to
their
parties
sent
into
the
quarters
to
spare
neither
man
woman
nor
and
as
to
the
preposterous
of
sir
john
temple
from
whom
the
subsequent
scribblers
borrowed
all
their
catalogues
giving
thousand
british
natives
as
the
number
killed
lord
testimony
is
to
the
effect
that
there
was
not
or
scarcely
five
thousand
of
that
number
of
british
natives
then
living
in
ireland
outside
of
the
cities
and
walled
towns
where
no
was
committed
lord
castlehaven
also
shows
that
there
were
not
persons
to
be
found
even
in
catalogue
although
it
was
then
a
matter
of
common
notoriety
that
he
repeats
the
same
people
and
the
same
circumstances
twice
or
thrice
and
mentions
hundreds
as
then
murdered
who
lived
many
years
afterwards
some
of
not
the
irish
victims
were
alive
when
castlehaven
wrote
but
the
true
test
of
the
character
of
this
insurrection
is
to
be
found
not
in
the
exaggerated
calumnies
of
english
libellers
writing
after
the
event
but
in
the
testimony
of
the
english
settlers
themselves
when
in
a
position
where
lies
would
have
been
of
no
avail
we
will
therefore
give
here
though
somewhat
out
of
the
course
of
our
narrative
an
incident
related
by
castlehaven
to
that
effect
shortly
after
he
had
been
appointed
general
of
the
horse
under
preston
of
the
confederate
catholics
in
leinster
that
general
took
among
other
places
birr
in
county
here
castlehaven
had
the
good
fortune
as
he
says
to
begin
his
command
with
an
act
of
charity
for
going
to
see
this
garrison
before
it
marched
out
he
came
into
a
large
room
where
he
found
many
people
of
quality
both
men
and
women
they
no
sooner
saw
him
but
with
tears
in
their
eyes
they
fell
on
their
knees
desiring
him
to
save
their
lives
was
astonished
says
castlehaven
their
posture
and
petition
and
having
made
them
rise
asked
what
the
matter
was
they
answered
that
from
the
first
day
of
the
war
there
had
been
continued
action
and
bloodshed
between
them
and
their
irish
neighbors
and
little
quarter
on
either
side
and
therefore
understanding
that
i
was
an
englishman
begged
i
would
take
them
into
my
it
is
enough
to
say
that
lord
castlehaven
with
some
difficulty
and
by
personally
taking
command
of
a
strong
convoy
obtained
for
them
the
protection
they
prayed
for
from
the
exasperated
and
outraged
population
around
them
but
what
we
wish
to
point
out
is
this
that
here
are
those
victims
of
sir
john
not
the
garrison
of
the
fort
observe
but
the
english
settlers
driven
in
by
the
approach
of
army
after
terrorizing
the
country
for
months
now
with
the
fear
of
death
before
them
confessing
on
their
knees
that
from
the
first
day
of
the
war
they
had
arms
in
their
hands
and
that
little
quarter
was
given
on
either
side
how
well
the
english
were
able
to
take
care
of
themselves
at
this
time
and
what
were
like
are
shown
by
the
following
extract
from
a
letter
of
colonel
the
hon
mervin
touchett
to
his
brother
lord
castlehaven
touchett
is
describing
a
raid
made
by
sir
arthur
loffens
governor
of
naas
with
a
party
of
horse
and
dragoons
killing
such
of
the
irish
as
they
met
to
punish
an
attack
upon
an
english
party
a
few
days
before
the
most
considerable
slaughter
was
in
a
great
strength
of
furze
scattered
on
a
hill
where
the
people
of
several
villages
taking
the
alarm
had
sheltered
themselves
now
sir
arthur
having
invested
the
hill
set
the
furze
on
fire
on
all
sides
where
the
people
being
a
considerable
number
were
all
burned
or
killed
men
women
and
children
i
saw
the
bodies
and
the
furze
still
we
remember
the
denunciations
of
the
english
press
some
years
ago
when
it
was
stated
without
much
authentication
that
some
of
the
french
commanders
in
the
algerine
campaigns
had
smoked
some
arabs
to
death
in
caves
but
it
would
seem
from
narrative
that
the
english
troopers
would
have
been
able
to
give
their
french
comrades
lessons
in
the
culinary
art
of
war
some
centuries
ago
a
grilled
irishman
is
surely
as
savory
an
object
for
the
contemplation
of
humanity
as
a
smoked
arab
but
whatever
the
atrocities
on
the
english
side
we
will
not
say
that
the
cruelties
committed
by
the
irish
were
not
deserving
of
reprobation
and
anger
only
this
is
to
be
observed
that
whereas
the
by
the
irish
were
confined
to
the
rabble
and
disbanded
soldiers
those
committed
by
the
english
side
were
shared
in
as
the
narratives
of
the
day
show
by
the
persons
highest
in
position
and
authority
they
made
part
of
the
english
system
of
government
of
that
day
on
the
other
hand
the
leading
men
of
the
irish
catholic
body
not
only
endeavored
to
stay
those
murders
but
sought
to
induce
the
government
to
bring
the
authors
of
them
on
both
sides
to
punishment
but
in
vain
on
the
of
march
viscount
gormanstown
and
sir
robert
talbot
on
behalf
of
the
nobility
and
gentry
of
the
nation
presented
a
remonstrance
praying
the
murders
on
both
sides
committed
should
be
strictly
examined
and
the
authors
of
them
punished
according
to
the
utmost
severity
of
the
which
proposal
castlehaven
shrewdly
remarks
would
never
have
been
rejected
by
their
adversaries
that
they
were
conscious
of
being
deeper
in
the
mire
than
they
would
have
the
world
so
far
the
and
first
uprising
now
as
to
the
inception
of
the
war
of
the
confederate
catholics
and
its
objects
lord
narrative
is
equally
convincing
and
clear
parliament
met
in
the
castle
of
dublin
the
rebellion
was
laid
before
both
houses
by
the
sir
william
parsons
and
sir
john
borlace
concurrent
resolutions
were
adopted
without
a
dissenting
voice
by
the
two
houses
declaring
their
abhorrence
of
the
rebellion
and
pledging
their
lives
and
fortunes
to
suppress
it
castlehaven
had
a
seat
in
the
irish
house
of
lords
as
an
irish
peer
and
being
then
in
ireland
as
before
related
took
his
seat
at
the
meeting
of
parliament
besides
castlehaven
most
of
the
leaders
of
the
war
that
ensued
were
members
of
the
irish
house
of
lords
these
catholic
peers
were
not
less
earnest
than
the
rest
in
their
unanimous
intention
to
put
down
the
rebellion
both
houses
thereupon
began
to
deliberate
upon
the
most
effectual
means
for
its
suppression
this
way
of
proceeding
says
castlehaven
not
it
seems
square
with
the
designs
who
were
often
heard
to
say
that
more
were
in
rebellion
the
more
lands
should
be
forfeit
to
therefore
in
the
midst
of
the
deliberations
of
parliament
on
the
subject
a
prorogation
was
determined
on
the
lords
understanding
this
sent
castlehaven
and
viscount
castelloe
to
join
a
deputation
from
the
commons
to
the
praying
them
not
to
prorogue
at
least
till
the
rebels
then
few
in
number
were
reduced
to
obedience
but
the
address
was
slighted
and
parliament
prorogued
the
next
day
to
the
great
surprise
of
both
houses
and
the
dislike
says
castlehaven
all
honest
and
knowing
the
result
was
as
the
no
doubt
intended
that
the
rebels
were
greatly
encouraged
and
at
once
began
to
show
themselves
in
quarters
hitherto
peaceful
the
members
of
parliament
retired
to
their
in
much
anxiety
after
the
prorogation
lord
castlehaven
went
to
his
seat
at
maddingstown
there
he
received
a
letter
signed
by
the
viscounts
of
gormanstown
and
netterville
and
by
the
barons
of
slane
lowth
and
dunsany
containing
an
enclosure
to
the
which
those
noblemen
desired
him
to
forward
to
them
and
if
possible
obtain
an
answer
this
letter
to
the
castlehaven
says
was
very
humble
and
submissive
asking
only
permission
to
send
their
petitions
into
england
to
represent
their
grievances
to
the
king
the
only
reply
of
the
was
a
warning
to
castlehaven
to
receive
no
more
letters
from
them
meanwhile
parties
were
sent
out
from
dublin
and
the
various
garrisons
throughout
the
kingdom
to
and
destroy
the
but
those
parties
took
little
pains
to
distinguish
rebels
from
loyal
subjects
provided
they
were
only
catholics
killing
promiscuously
men
women
and
children
reprisals
followed
on
the
part
of
the
rebels
the
nobility
and
gentry
were
between
two
fires
a
contribution
was
levied
upon
them
by
the
rebels
after
the
manner
of
the
scots
in
the
north
of
england
in
but
although
to
pay
that
contribution
in
england
passed
without
reproach
in
ireland
it
was
denounced
by
the
as
treason
the
english
troopers
insulted
and
openly
threatened
the
most
distinguished
irish
families
as
favorers
of
the
rebellion
says
castlehaven
the
sight
of
their
tenants
the
harmless
country
people
without
respect
to
age
or
sex
thus
barbarously
murdered
made
the
catholic
nobility
and
gentry
at
last
resolved
to
stand
upon
their
nevertheless
before
openly
raising
the
standard
of
revolt
against
the
irish
government
which
refused
to
protect
them
they
made
several
efforts
to
get
their
petitions
before
charles
i
sir
john
read
a
scotchman
then
going
to
england
undertook
to
forward
petitions
to
the
king
but
being
arrested
on
suspicion
at
drogheda
was
taken
to
dublin
and
there
put
upon
the
rack
by
the
to
endeavor
to
wring
from
him
a
confession
of
charles
complicity
in
the
rebellion
this
mervin
touchett
heard
from
sir
john
read
himself
as
he
was
brought
out
of
the
room
where
he
was
racked
but
that
unfortunate
monarch
knew
not
how
to
choose
his
friends
or
to
be
faithful
to
them
when
he
found
them
he
referred
the
whole
conduct
of
irish
affairs
to
the
english
parliament
thus
increasing
the
discontent
to
the
last
pitch
by
making
it
plain
to
the
whole
irish
people
that
he
abandoned
the
duty
of
protecting
them
and
had
handed
them
over
to
the
mercy
of
their
worst
enemies
the
english
parliament
that
parliament
at
once
passed
a
succession
of
wild
votes
and
ordinances
indicating
their
intention
of
stopping
short
at
nothing
less
than
utter
extirpation
of
the
native
race
they
declared
they
would
never
give
consent
to
any
toleration
of
the
popish
religion
in
ireland
in
february
following
when
few
of
any
estate
were
as
yet
engaged
in
the
rebellion
they
passed
an
act
assigning
two
million
five
hundred
thousand
acres
of
cultivated
land
besides
immense
tracts
of
bogs
woods
and
mountains
to
english
and
scotch
adventurers
for
a
small
proportion
of
money
on
the
grant
this
money
the
act
stated
was
to
go
to
the
reduction
of
the
rebels
but
with
a
fine
irony
of
providence
upon
the
weak
compliance
every
penny
of
it
was
afterwards
used
to
raise
armies
by
the
english
rebels
against
him
the
greatest
discontent
of
all
says
castlehaven
about
the
proroguing
the
parliament
the
only
way
the
nation
had
to
express
its
loyalty
and
prevent
their
being
misrepresented
to
their
sovereign
which
had
it
been
permitted
to
sit
for
any
reasonable
time
would
in
all
likelihood
without
any
great
charge
or
trouble
have
brought
the
rebels
to
thus
all
hopes
of
redress
or
safety
being
at
an
end
a
villanous
government
in
dublin
intent
only
upon
confiscation
a
furious
parliament
in
london
breathing
vengeance
against
the
whole
irish
race
and
a
king
so
embroiled
in
his
english
quarrels
that
he
could
do
nothing
to
help
his
irish
subjects
even
had
he
wished
it
what
was
left
those
loyal
gallant
and
devoted
men
but
to
draw
the
sword
for
their
own
safety
the
rebellion
by
degrees
spread
over
the
whole
kingdom
now
says
castlehaven
no
more
looking
back
for
all
were
in
arms
and
full
of
a
council
of
the
leading
catholic
nobles
military
officers
and
gentry
met
at
kilkenny
and
formed
themselves
into
an
association
under
the
title
of
the
confederate
catholics
of
ireland
four
generals
were
appointed
for
the
respective
provinces
of
the
kingdom
preston
for
leinster
barry
for
munster
owen
roe
for
ulster
and
burke
for
connaught
thus
war
was
declared
when
the
rebellion
first
broke
out
in
the
north
lord
castlehaven
had
immediately
repaired
to
dublin
and
offered
his
services
to
the
they
were
declined
with
the
reply
that
religion
was
an
after
the
prorogation
of
parliament
as
we
have
seen
he
retired
to
his
house
in
the
country
then
coming
again
to
dublin
to
meet
a
charge
of
corresponding
with
the
rebels
which
had
been
brought
against
him
he
was
arrested
by
order
of
the
and
after
twenty
weeks
of
imprisonment
in
the
house
was
committed
to
the
castle
startled
me
a
little
says
castlehaven
as
it
well
might
do
for
the
state
exit
from
the
castle
in
dublin
in
those
days
was
usually
made
in
the
same
way
as
from
the
tower
in
london
namely
by
the
block
brought
into
my
thoughts
the
proceedings
against
the
earl
of
strafford
who
confiding
in
his
own
innocence
was
voted
out
of
his
life
by
an
unprecedented
bill
of
therefore
hearing
nothing
while
in
prison
but
rejoicings
at
the
misfortunes
who
at
last
had
been
forced
to
take
up
arms
by
the
english
rebels
and
knowing
the
to
be
of
the
parliament
faction
and
the
the
marquis
of
ormond
being
desperately
sick
of
a
fever
not
without
suspicion
of
poison
and
his
petition
to
be
sent
to
england
to
be
tried
there
by
his
peers
being
refused
he
determined
to
make
his
escape
shrewdly
concluding
as
he
says
that
was
a
scurvy
plea
in
an
angry
arriving
at
kilkenny
he
joined
the
confederacy
as
has
been
related
from
this
time
the
war
of
the
confederate
catholics
was
carried
on
with
varying
success
until
the
cessation
of
and
then
until
the
peace
of
when
the
confederates
united
but
too
late
with
the
marquis
of
ormond
to
stop
the
march
of
cromwell
a
sweet
singer
adelaide
anne
procter
she
sang
of
love
the
love
whose
fires
burn
with
a
pure
and
gentle
flame
no
passion
lights
of
wild
desires
red
with
the
lurid
glow
of
shame
she
sang
of
angels
and
their
wings
seemed
rustling
through
each
soft
refrain
gladness
and
sorrow
kindred
things
she
wove
in
many
a
tender
strain
she
sang
of
heaven
and
of
god
of
star
and
way
gethsemane
the
bloody
sod
death
darkness
she
sang
of
mary
mother
blest
her
sweetest
carols
were
of
thee
close
folded
to
thy
loving
breast
how
fair
her
home
in
heaven
must
be
the
colporteurs
of
bonn
i
was
very
stupid
in
my
youth
and
am
still
far
from
being
sharp
i
could
not
master
knotty
questions
like
other
boys
so
this
natural
deficiency
had
to
be
supplemented
by
some
plan
that
would
facilitate
the
acquisition
of
knowledge
the
advantage
to
be
derived
from
a
garrulous
preceptor
whose
mind
was
stored
with
all
sorts
of
learning
without
dogmatism
or
hard
formularies
were
fully
appreciated
by
my
parents
john
was
a
very
old
man
when
i
was
a
boy
and
he
was
just
the
person
qualified
to
impart
an
astonishing
quantity
of
all
sorts
of
facts
and
perhaps
fancies
i
hold
him
in
affectionate
remembrance
though
he
be
dead
over
years
and
rests
near
the
remains
of
his
favorite
hero
in
glasnevin
cemetery
when
he
became
the
chief
architect
of
my
intellectual
structure
i
thought
him
the
most
learned
man
in
the
world
on
account
of
my
dulness
he
adopted
the
method
of
sermonizing
to
me
instead
of
giving
me
unintelligible
lessons
to
be
learned
out
of
books
i
took
a
great
fancy
to
him
because
i
found
him
exceedingly
interesting
and
he
evinced
a
strong
liking
for
me
because
i
was
docile
we
became
inseparable
companions
notwithstanding
the
great
discrepancy
in
our
years
his
tall
erect
lank
figure
and
lantern
jaw
were
to
me
the
physiological
signs
of
profundity
firmness
and
power
and
his
white
head
was
the
symbol
of
wisdom
our
tastes
well
i
had
no
tastes
save
such
as
he
chose
to
awaken
in
me
and
hence
there
came
to
be
very
soon
a
great
similitude
in
our
respective
inclinations
i
was
like
a
ball
of
wax
a
sheet
of
paper
or
any
other
original
impressionable
thing
you
may
name
in
his
hands
for
ten
years
after
which
very
probably
i
began
to
harden
though
i
was
not
conscious
of
the
process
however
the
large
fund
of
knowledge
that
he
imparted
to
me
crystallized
as
it
were
and
became
fixed
in
my
possession
as
firmly
as
if
it
had
been
elaborately
achieved
by
a
severe
mental
training
after
i
went
to
college
he
was
still
my
friend
and
rejoiced
in
my
subsequent
successes
and
followed
me
with
a
jealous
eye
and
a
sort
of
parental
anxiety
in
my
foreign
travels
and
even
in
death
he
did
not
forget
me
for
he
made
me
the
custodian
of
his
great
heaps
of
literary
productions
all
in
manuscript
embracing
sketches
diaries
notes
of
travel
learned
fragments
on
scientific
and
scholastic
topics
essays
tales
letters
the
beginnings
and
the
endings
and
the
middles
of
books
on
history
politics
and
polemics
pieces
of
pamphlets
and
speeches
with
a
miscellaneous
lot
of
poetry
in
all
measures
he
was
a
great
good
man
who
never
had
what
is
called
an
aim
in
life
but
he
certainly
had
an
aim
life
and
yet
no
one
could
esteem
the
importance
of
this
pilgrimage
more
than
he
did
he
would
frequently
boast
of
being
heterodox
on
that
point
will
hear
he
would
remark
depreciating
this
life
as
a
matter
of
little
concern
allow
their
sophistry
to
have
much
weight
with
you
the
prevalent
opinions
which
are
flippantly
spoken
thereon
will
not
stand
the
test
of
sound
christian
reasoning
that
part
of
human
existence
which
finds
its
scene
and
scope
of
exertion
in
this
life
is
filled
with
eternal
potentialities
you
have
heard
it
said
that
man
wants
but
little
here
below
where
else
does
he
want
it
here
is
where
he
wants
everything
then
do
not
hesitate
to
ask
but
be
careful
not
to
ask
amiss
when
the
battle
is
over
it
will
be
too
late
to
make
requisitions
for
auxiliaries
if
you
conquer
assistance
will
not
be
wanted
if
you
are
defeated
assistance
can
not
reach
you
the
fight
can
not
be
renewed
the
victory
or
defeat
will
be
final
this
life
is
immense
you
can
not
think
too
much
of
it
can
not
estimate
it
too
highly
a
minute
has
almost
an
infinite
value
man
wants
much
here
and
wants
it
all
the
i
thought
his
language
at
that
time
fantastical
now
i
regard
it
as
profound
from
a
survey
of
his
own
aimless
career
it
is
evident
he
did
not
reduce
the
good
of
earthly
existence
of
which
he
spoke
to
any
sort
of
money
value
those
elements
and
forces
of
life
to
which
he
attached
such
deep
significance
and
importance
could
not
have
their
equivalent
in
currency
nor
in
comforts
nor
in
real
estate
nor
even
in
fame
my
old
preceptor
had
spent
most
of
his
youth
in
travelling
and
the
picturesque
meanderings
of
the
rhine
furnished
subjects
for
many
of
his
later
recollections
i
recall
now
with
a
melancholy
regret
the
many
pleasant
evenings
i
enjoyed
listening
to
his
narratives
of
travel
on
that
historic
river
and
in
imagination
sat
with
him
on
the
crest
looking
down
upon
scenes
made
memorable
by
the
lives
and
struggles
of
countless
heroes
and
the
crowds
of
humanity
that
came
and
went
through
the
course
of
a
hundred
generations
some
leaving
their
mark
and
others
erasing
it
again
some
leaving
a
smile
behind
them
on
the
face
of
the
country
and
others
a
scar
he
loved
to
talk
about
the
beautiful
city
of
bonn
where
he
had
spent
some
years
it
being
the
most
attractive
place
he
said
from
strasbourg
to
the
sea
for
learning
was
cheap
there
and
so
were
victuals
the
only
things
he
found
indispensable
to
a
happy
life
he
would
glide
into
a
monologue
of
dramatic
glow
and
fervor
in
reciting
how
he
procured
access
to
the
extensive
library
of
its
new
university
and
crawling
up
a
would
perch
himself
on
top
like
a
hun
who
after
a
sleep
of
a
thousand
years
had
resurrected
himself
gathered
his
bones
from
the
plains
of
chalons
and
having
procured
a
suit
of
modern
clothes
from
a
jew
in
cologne
traced
with
eager
avidity
the
vicissitudes
of
war
and
empire
since
the
days
of
attila
it
was
there
no
doubt
he
discovered
the
materials
of
this
curious
paper
which
i
found
among
his
literary
remains
whether
he
gathered
the
materials
himself
or
merely
transcribed
the
work
of
some
previous
writer
i
am
unable
to
determine
without
laying
any
claim
to
critical
acumen
i
must
confess
it
appears
to
me
to
be
a
meritorious
piece
and
i
picked
it
out
because
i
thought
it
unique
and
brief
for
submission
to
the
more
extensive
experience
and
more
impartial
judgment
of
the
catholic
readers
having
entire
control
of
these
productions
of
my
friend
and
preceptor
i
took
the
liberty
of
substituting
modern
phraseology
for
what
was
antique
and
of
putting
the
sketch
in
such
style
that
the
most
superficial
reader
will
have
no
difficulty
in
running
it
over
objection
may
be
raised
to
the
title
on
the
score
of
fitness
i
did
not
feel
authorized
to
change
it
believing
the
one
chosen
by
the
judgment
of
my
old
friend
as
suitable
as
any
i
could
substitute
in
the
year
the
mind
of
man
was
as
restless
and
impatient
of
restraint
as
now
and
some
people
in
bonn
under
a
quiet
exterior
nursed
in
their
bosoms
latent
volcanoes
of
passion
and
indulged
the
waywardness
of
rebellious
fancy
to
a
degree
that
would
have
proved
calamitous
to
the
placid
flow
of
life
and
thought
could
instrumentality
for
action
have
been
found
there
is
indubitable
proof
that
the
principle
of
the
reformation
which
three
hundred
years
later
burst
through
the
environment
of
dogma
and
spread
like
a
flood
of
lava
over
europe
existed
actively
in
bonn
in
the
year
named
and
would
have
arrived
at
mature
strength
if
nature
had
not
interposed
an
impassable
barrier
to
the
proceeding
it
is
hard
to
rebel
against
nature
and
it
is
madness
to
expect
success
in
such
a
revolt
fourteen
men
whose
names
have
come
down
to
us
gave
body
and
tone
and
a
not
very
clearly
defined
purpose
to
this
untimely
uprising
against
the
inevitable
in
bonn
how
many
others
were
in
sympathy
or
in
active
affiliation
with
them
is
not
shown
those
fourteen
were
bold
spirits
who
labored
under
the
misfortune
of
having
come
into
the
world
three
or
four
centuries
too
soon
they
were
great
men
out
of
place
there
is
an
element
of
rebellion
in
great
spirits
which
only
finds
its
proper
antidote
in
the
stronger
and
more
harmonious
principle
of
obedience
obedience
is
the
first
condition
of
creatures
those
fourteen
grew
weary
of
listening
to
the
gospel
preached
every
sunday
from
the
pulpit
of
remigius
when
they
attended
mass
with
the
thousands
of
their
townsmen
the
scriptures
both
new
and
old
were
given
out
in
small
doses
with
an
abundant
mixture
of
explanation
and
homily
and
salutary
exhortation
their
appetites
craved
a
larger
supply
of
scripture
and
indeed
some
of
them
were
so
unreasonable
as
to
desire
the
reading
of
the
whole
book
from
genesis
to
revelations
at
one
service
us
said
giestfacher
it
all
no
one
is
authorized
to
give
a
selection
from
the
bible
and
hold
back
the
rest
it
is
our
feast
and
we
have
a
right
to
the
full
enjoyment

heuck
his
neighbor
to
whom
he
addressed
the
remonstrance
to
the
and
purchase
a
copy
and
send
your
ass
to
carry

our
friend
schwartz
finished
a
fine
one
last
week
it
can
be
had
for
sixteen
hundred
dollars
when
you
have
it
safe
at
home
employ
a
reader
who
will
be
able
to
mouth
it
all
off
for
you
in
fifty
hours
allowing
a
few
intervals
for
refreshment
but
none
for
and
heuck
laughed
or
rather
sneered
at
giestfacher
as
he
walked
away
giestfacher
was
a
reformer
however
and
was
not
to
be
put
down
in
that
frivolous
manner
he
had
been
a
student
himself
with
the
view
of
entering
the
ministry
but
being
maliciously
charged
with
certain
grave
irregularities
his
prospects
in
that
direction
were
seriously
clouded
and
in
a
moment
of
grand
though
passionate
he
threw
up
his
expectations
and
abandoned
the
idea
of
entering
the
church
but
instead
took
to
the
world
he
was
a
reformer
from
his
infancy
and
continually
quarrelled
with
his
family
about
the
humdrum
state
of
things
at
home
was
at
enmity
with
the
system
of
municipal
government
at
bonn
and
held
very
animated
controversies
with
the
physicians
of
the
place
on
the
system
of
therapeutics
then
pursued
insisting
strongly
that
all
diseases
arose
from
bad
blood
and
that
a
vivisection
with
warm
wine
would
prove
a
remedy
for
everything
he
lacked
professional
skill
to
attempt
an
experiment
in
the
medical
reforms
he
advocated
besides
that
department
would
not
admit
of
bungling
with
impunity
for
municipal
reforms
he
failed
in
power
and
the
reward
in
fame
or
popular
applause
that
might
follow
successful
operations
in
that
limited
sphere
of
action
was
not
deemed
equivalent
to
the
labor
but
in
the
field
of
religion
there
was
ample
room
for
all
sorts
of
tentative
processes
without
danger
and
in
addition
to
security
notoriety
might
be
obtained
by
being
simply
he
had
settled
upon
religious
reform
and
his
enthusiasm
nullified
the
cautionary
suggestions
of
his
reason
and
reduced
mountains
of
difficulty
to
the
insignificant
magnitude
of
molehills
even
heuck
could
be
induced
to
adopt
his
views
by
cogent
reasoning
and
much
persuasion
enthusiasm
is
allied
to
madness
a
splendid
help
but
a
dangerous
guide
giestfacher
used
his
tongue
and
in
the
course
of
a
year
had
made
twelve
or
fourteen
proselytes
those
who
can
not
enjoy
the
monotony
of
life
and
the
spells
of
that
attack
the
temperaments
fly
to
novelty
for
relief
the
fearful
prospect
of
an
unknown
and
nameless
grave
and
an
oblivious
future
drives
many
restless
spirits
into
experiments
in
morals
and
in
politics
as
well
as
in
natural
philosophy
in
the
vain
hope
of
rescuing
their
names
from
the
of
that
awaits
mediocrity
the
new
reformers
zealous
men
and
bold
met
in
house
on
corpus

the
minutes
of
which

giestfacher
was
made

of
the
society
are
all
agreed
said
giestfacher
the
scriptures
ought
to
be
given
to
the
people
from
these
divine
writings
we
learn
a
time
shall
come
when
wars
shall
cease
and
the
alemanni
and
the
frank
and
the
tartar
may
eat
from
the
same
plate
and
drink
out
of
the
same
cup
in
peace
and
fraternity
and
wear
cloth
caps
instead
of
brass
helmets
and
plough
the
fields
with
their
spears
instead
of
letting
daylight
through
each
other
therewith
and
the
shepherds
shall
tend
their
flocks
with
a
crook
and
not
with
a
bow
to
keep
off
the
enemy
how
can
that
time
come
unless
the
people
be
made
acquainted
with
those
promises
i
believe
we
who
like
the
apostles
number
fourteen
are
divinely
commissioned
to
change
things
for
the
better
and
initiate
the
great
movements
which
will
bring
about
the
millennium
let
us
rise
up
to
the
dignity
of
our
position
let
us
prove
equal
to
the
inspiration
of
the
occasion
we
are
called
together
by
heaven
for
a
new
purpose
the
time
is
approaching
when
universal
light
will
dispel
the
gloom
and
peace
succeed
to
all
disturbance
let
us
give
the
scriptures
to
the
people
they
are
the
words
of
god
that
carry
healing
on
their
wings
they
are
the
dove
that
was
sent
out
from
the
ark
they
are
the
pillar
of
light
in
the
desert
they
are
the
sword
of
joshua
the
sling
of
david
the
rod
of
moses
let
us
fourteen
give
them
to
the
people
and
start
out
anew
like
the
apostles
from
jerusalem
to
overturn
the
idols
of
the
times
and
emancipate
the
nations
we
have
piled
up
heaps
of
stones
in
every
town
and
monuments
of
brass
and
still
men
are
not
changed
we
see
them
still
lying
warring
hoarding
riches
and
making
gods
of
their
bellies
all
of
which
is
condemned
by
the
word
of
god
what
will
change
all
this
i
say
let
the
piles
of
stone
and
the
monuments
of
brass
slide
and
give
the
scriptures
a
chance
let
us
give
them
to
the
people
and
the
reign
of
brotherhood
and
peace
will
commence
wars
shall
cease
nation
will
no
longer
rise
up
against
nation
rebellion
will
erect
its
horrid
front
no
more
men
will
cease
hoarding
riches
and
oppressing
the
poor
there
will
be
no
more
robbing
rings
in
corporate
towns
and
men
in
power
will
not
blacken
their
character
and
imperil
the
safety
of
the
state
by
nepotism
the
whole
world
will
become
pure
no
scandals
will
arise
in
the
church
and
there
will
be
no
blasphemy
or
false
swearing
and
christian
brethren
shall
not
conspire
for
each
see
remarked
heuck
those
who
have
the
scriptures
are
no
better
than
other
people
they
too
are
given
to
lying
hoarding
riches
warring
one
against
another
and
making
gods
of
their
bellies
how
is
that
said
blum
know
three
scriveners
of
this
town
who
boast
of
having
transcribed
twenty
bibles
each
and
they
get
drunk
thrice
a
week
and
quarrel
with
their
wives
and
giebricht
the
soldier
who
can
repeat
the
scriptures
until
you
sleep
listening
to
him
says
he
killed
nine
men
in
battle
and
wounded
twenty
others
the
scriptures
did
not
make
him
very
peaceful
the
loss
of
a
leg
had
a
more
quieting
effect
on
him
than
all
his
memorizing
of
the
sacred
did
not
get
together
said
werner
discuss
that
phase
of
the
subject
it
was
well
understood
and
thereunto
agreed
a
month
ago
that
the
spread
of
the
scriptures
was
desirable
and
to
this
end
we
met
that
means
wise
and
effective
may
be
devised
whereby
we
can
supply
every
one
with
the
word
of
god
that
all
may
search
therein
for
the
correct
and
approved
way
of
be
it
said
dusch
the
monk
hear
said
schwartz
us
agree
like
brethren
said
braunn
are
subject
to
one
spirit
said
hartzwein
the
vintner
all
moved
by
the
same
inspiration
discord
is
unseemly
we
must
not
dispute
on
the
subject
of
drunkenness
let
us
have
the
mature
views
of
brother
giestfacher
and
his
plans
the
end
is
already
clear
if
the
means
be
of
approved
piety
and
really
orthodox
in
addition
to
the
scriptures
i
would
rejoice
very
much
to
see
prayer
more
generally
practised
we
ought
to
do
nothing
without
prayer
let
us
first
of
all
consult
the
lord
what
says
brother
blum
blum
rose
and
said
it
was
a
purely
business
meeting
he
had
no
doubt
it
ought
to
have
been
opened
with
prayer
it
was
an
old
and
salutary
practice
that
came
down
from
the
days
of
the
apostles
and
paul
recommended
it
but
as
they
were
now
in
the
midst
of
business
he
thought
it
would
be
as
wise
and
as
conformable
with
ancient
christian
and
saintly
practice
to
go
on
with
their
work
and
rest
satisfied
with
mental
ejaculation
as
to
inaugurate
a
formal
esch
thought
differently
he
held
that
prayer
was
always
in
season
reudlehuber
meekly
said
that
the
scriptures
showed
there
was
a
time
for
everything
whence
it
was
plain
that
prayer
might
be
out
of
place
as
well
as
penitential
tears
on
some
occasions
it
would
not
look
well
for
a
man
to
rise
up
in
the
midst
of
a
marriage
feast
and
beating
his
breast
cry
out
have
too
many
prayers
in
the
church
said
giestfacher
not
enough
of
scripture
that
is
the
trouble
with
us
brethren
must
rise
above
the
weaknesses
of
the
mere
pietist
moses
was
no
pietist
he
was
a
great
big
leonine
character
we
must
be
broad
and
liberal
in
our
views
not
given
to
nor
complaining
pray
whenever
you
feel
like
it
and
drink
when
you
have
a
mind
to
noah
got
drunk
rather
be
the
prodigal
son
and
indulge
in
a
hearty
natural
appetite
for
awhile
than
be
his
cautious
speculating
avaricious
brother
who
had
not
soul
enough
most
likely
to
treat
his
acquaintances
to
a
pint
of
wine
once
in
his
lifetime
great
men
get
tipsy
great
nations
are
bibulous
we
are
not
here
to
make
war
on
those
who
drink
wine
and
cultivate
the
grape
nor
are
we
authorized
in
making
war
on
weavers
because
dives
was
damned
for
wearing
fine
linen
it
is
our
mission
to
spread
the
scriptures
the
world
wants
light
he
is
a
benefactor
of
mankind
who
puts
two
rays
where
there
was
only
one
us
hear
your
plans
brother
giestfacher
cried
out
a
number
of
voices
simultaneously
in
response
brother
giestfacher
stated
that
there
were
no
plans
necessary
all
that
was
to
be
done
was
to
circulate
the
scriptures
let
us
get
one
hundred
thousand
sheets
of
vellum
to
begin
with
and
set
a
hundred
scriveners
to
work
transcribing
copies
of
the
bible
and
then
distribute
these
copies
among
the
people
the
plan
was
plain
and
simple
and
magnificent
braunn
thought
but
there
were
not
ten
thousand
sheets
of
vellum
in
the
town
nor
in
the
whole
district
and
much
of
that
would
be
required
for
civil
uses
besides
the
number
of
sheep
in
the
neighborhood
had
been
so
reduced
by
the
recent
war
that
vellum
would
be
scarce
and
costly
for
ten
years
to
come
werner
lamented
the
irremediable
condition
of
the
world
when
the
free
circulation
of
the
word
of
god
depended
on
the
number
of
sheep
and
the
number
of
sheep
was
regulated
by
war
and
war
by
the
ambition
jealousy
or
pride
of
princes
is
painfully
true
said
heuck
the
world
stands
in
sad
need
of
reform
if
souls
are
to
be
rescued
from
their
spiritual
perils
only
by
the
means
proposed
in
the
magnificent
scheme
of
brother
it
was
horrible
to
think
that
the
immortal
part
of
man
was
doomed
to
perish
to
be
snuffed
out
as
it
were
in
eternal
darkness
because
soldiers
had
an
unholy
appetite
for
mutton
braunn
said
the
work
could
be
started
on
three
or
four
thousand
hides
and
ere
they
were
used
up
a
new
supply
might
arrive
from
some
unexpected
quarter
esch
said
that
they
ought
to
have
faith
the
hand
that
fed
the
patriarch
in
the
desert
would
provide
vellum
if
he
was
prayerfully
besought
for
assistance
would
be
willing
to
commence
on
one
sheet
feeling
convinced
there
would
be
more
than
enough
in
the
end
blum
did
not
take
altogether
so
sanguine
a
view
of
things
as
brother
esch
he
was
especially
dubious
about
that
vellum
supply
not
that
he
questioned
the
power
of
providence
at
all
but
it
struck
him
that
it
would
be
just
as
well
and
as
easy
for
the
society
to
prayerfully
ask
for
an
ample
supply
of
bibles
as
to
expect
a
miracle
in
prepared
and
he
was
still
further
persuaded
that
if
the
books
were
absolutely
necessary
to
salvation
they
would
be
miraculously
given
but
he
did
not
put
the
movement
on
that
ground
it
is
very
easy
for
men
and
particularly
idiotic
men
to
convince
themselves
that
god
will
answer
all
their
whims
and
caprices
by
the
performance
of
a
miracle
we
are
going
upon
the
theory
that
the
work
is
good
just
as
it
is
good
to
feed
the
hungry
and
clothe
the
naked
we
expect
to
find
favor
in
heaven
because
we
endeavor
to
do
a
work
of
charity
according
to
our
honest
impression
many
persons
inquired
heuck
you
propose
to
supply
with
complete
copies
of
the
scriptures
one
in
the
district
replied
giestfacher
dusch
continued
heuck
many
heads
of
families
are
there
in
the
district
your
abbot
had
the
census
taken
a
few
ago
while
you
were
yet
in
grace
and
favor
at
the
brother
dusch
said
he
heard
there
were
thousand
from
the
drachenfels
to
within
six
miles
of
cologne
but
all
of
them
could
not
read
will
send
out
said
giestfacher
enthusiastically
army
of
colporteurs
who
will
distribute
and
read
at
the
same
perceive
said
blum
this
discussion
will
never
stop
new
avenues
of
thought
and
new
mountains
of
objection
are
coming
to
view
at
every
advance
in
the
debate
let
us
do
something
first
and
talk
afterwards
to
supply
thousand
persons
with
expensive
volumes
will
require
considerably
more
than
mere
resolves
and
enthusiasm
i
propose
that
we
buy
up
all
the
vellum
in
the
city
and
that
we
all
go
security
for
the
payment
i
propose
also
that
we
employ
brothers
braunn
schwartz
werner
and
reudlehuber
to
commence
transcribing
and
that
we
all
go
security
for
their
pay
unless
we
begin
somewhere
we
can
never
have
anything
done
what
says
brother
giestfacher
giestfacher
said
it
did
not
become
men
of
action
reformers
who
proposed
to
turn
over
the
world
and
inaugurate
a
new
era
and
a
new
life
and
a
new
law
to
stop
at
trifles
or
to
consider
petty
difficulties
the
design
that
had
been
developed
at
that
meeting
contemplated
a
sweeping
change
instead
of
having
a
few
books
here
and
there
at
every
church
cathedral
monastery
and
learnedly
and
laboriously
expounded
by
saints
of
a
thousand
austerities
and
of
penitential
garb
every
house
would
be
supplied
and
there
should
be
no
more
destitution
in
the
land
the
prophecies
and
the
gospels
and
the
mysteries
of
revelation
would
be
on
the
lips
of
sucking
babes
and
the
people
who
stood
at
the
and
at
the
marts
of
trade
the
tiller
of
the
soil
the
pedler
the
sailor
the
old
soldier
and
the
liberated
prisoner
together
with
the
man
who
sold
fish
and
the
woman
who
sold
buttermilk
would
stand
up
and
preach
the
gospel
and
display
a
mission
schoolboys
would
discuss
the
contents
of
that
book
freely
and
even
the
inmates
of
lunatic
asylums
would
expound
it
with
luminous
aptitude
and
startling
fancy
the
proposition
of
brother
blum
met
his
entire
approval
he
would
pledge
everything
he
had
and
risk
even
life
itself
to
start
the
new
principle
so
that
the
world
might
bask
in
sunshine
and
not
in
shadow
it
was
about
time
that
men
had
their
intellects
brightened
up
some
even
in
the
days
of
the
apostles
those
pious
men
did
not
do
their
whole
duty
they
labored
with
much
assiduity
and
conscientiousness
but
they
neglected
to
adopt
measures
looking
to
the
spread
of
the
scriptures
he
had
no
doubt
but
they
fell
a
long
way
short
of
their
mission
and
were
now
enduring
the
pangs
of
a
peck
of
purgatorial
coal
for
their
remissness
there
were
good
men
who
perhaps
found
heaven
without
interesting
themselves
in
the
multiplication
of
copies
of
the
bible
they
were
not
called
to
that
work
but
what
was
to
be
thought
of
those
who
had
the
call
the
power
the
skill
and
yet
neglected
to
spread
the
word
he
believed
ss
gregory
nazianzen
athanasius
jerome
chrysostom
augustine
and
others
of
those
early
doctors
of
the
church
had
a
fearful
account
to
render
for
having
neglected
the
scriptures
paul
too
was
not
free
from
censure
it
was
true
he
wrote
a
few
things
but
he
took
no
thought
of
multiplying
copies
of
his
epistles
many
copies
inquired
heuck
you
think
paul
ought
to
have
written
of
his
letters
before
you
would
consider
him
blameless
ought
said
giestfacher
have
written
all
the
time
instead
of
making
tents
many
is
a
professional
question
which
i
will
leave
the
scriveners
to
answer
i
may
remark
that
it
would
evidently
be
unprofitable
for
us
to
enter
on
a
minute
and
detailed
discussion
on
that
point
here
it
is
our
duty
to
supplement
the
shortcomings
of
those
early
workers
in
the
field
and
finish
what
they
failed
to
accomplish
they
were
bound
to
give
the
new
principle
a
fair
start
the
plan
suggested
was
the
best
simplest
and
clearest
and
he
hoped
every
one
of
the
brethren
would
give
it
a
hearty
and
cordial
the
principle
of
communism
or
the
right
of
communities
to
govern
themselves
in
certain
affairs
and
to
carry
on
free
trade
with
certain
other
communities
had
been
granted
the
previous
century
and
bonn
was
one
of
the
towns
that
enjoyed
the
privilege
but
the
people
still
respected
religion
and
did
no
trafficking
on
holydays
giestfacher
could
not
therefore
purchase
the
vellum
on
corpus
christi
but
had
to
wait
till
next
day
at
which
time
he
could
not
conveniently
find
the
other
members
of
the
new
bible
society
and
fearing
that
news
of
their
project
would
get
abroad
and
raise
the
price
of
the
article
he
wanted
he
hastened
to
the
various
places
where
it
was
kept
for
sale
and
bought
all
of
it
up
in
the
course
of
two
hours
paying
his
own
money
in
part
and
giving
his
bond
for
the
balance
the
parchment
was
delivered
to
the
four
scriveners
who
gathered
their
families
about
them
and
all
the
assistants
journeymen
that
could
be
found
in
the
town
and
proceeded
with
the
transcribing
of
the
bible
at
the
next
meeting
each
scrivener
reported
that
he
had
about
half
a
book
ready
that
the
work
was
going
rapidly
and
smoothly
forward
and
that
the
scribes
were
enthusiastic
at
the
prospect
of
brisk
business
and
good
pay
the
report
was
deemed
very
encouraging
it
went
to
show
that
the
society
could
have
four
bibles
every
two
weeks
or
about
one
hundred
a
year
and
that
in
the
course
of
two
hundred
and
twenty
years
every
head
of
a
family
in
the
district
could
be
provided
with
a
bible
of
his
own
the
scriveners
stated
moreover
that
they
had
neglected
their
profane
business
for
which
they
could
have
got
cash
to
proceed
in
the
sacred
work
and
as
there
were
several
people
depending
on
them
for
means
of
living
a
little
money
would
be
absolutely
necessary
with
the
grace
of
god
giestfacher
also
stated
that
he
spent
all
the
money
he
had
in
part
payment
for
the
parchment
and
pledged
his
property
for
the
balance
his
business
was
somewhat
crippled
already
in
consequence
of
the
outlay
and
he
expected
to
have
part
of
the
burden
assumed
by
every
one
of
the
society
werner
said
he
had
fifteen
transcribers
working
for
him
and
each
one
agreed
to
let
of
the
market
value
of
his
work
remain
in
the
hands
of
the
society
as
a
subscription
to
the
good
work
but
the
other
would
have
to
be
paid
weekly
as
they
could
not
live
without
means
they
were
all
poor
and
depending
solely
on
their
skill
in
transcribing
for
a
living
the
debate
was
long
earnest
eloquent
and
more
or
less
pious
blum
made
a
motion
that
the
bishop
of
the
diocese
and
the
pope
be
made
honorary
members
of
the
society
giestfacher
opposed
this
with
eloquent
acrimony
saying
it
was
a
movement
outside
of
all
sorts
of
church
patronage
that
it
was
designed
to
supersede
churches
and
preaching
for
when
every
man
had
the
bible
he
would
be
a
church
unto
himself
and
would
not
need
any
more
teaching
he
also
had
a
resolution
adopted
pledging
each
and
every
member
to
constitute
himself
a
colporteur
of
the
bible
and
to
read
and
peddle
it
in
sun
and
rain
and
it
was
finally
settled
that
a
subscription
should
be
taken
up
that
each
member
of
the
society
be
constituted
a
collector
and
proceed
at
once
to
every
man
who
loved
the
lord
and
gloried
in
the
gospel
to
get
his
contribution
at
the
next
meeting
the
brethren
were
all
present
except
dusch
who
was
reported
as
an
absconder
with
the
funds
he
had
collected
and
was
said
to
be
at
that
moment
in
cologne
drunk
perhaps
four
complete
bibles
were
presented
as
the
result
of
two
hard
labor
and
pious
effort
and
the
aggregate
production
of
writers
the
financial
reports
on
the
whole
were
favorable
and
the
scriveners
were
provided
with
sufficient
means
and
encouragement
to
begin
another
set
of
four
bibles
brother
giestfacher
was
partially
secured
in
his
venture
for
the
parchment
while
it
was
said
that
the
article
had
doubled
in
price
during
the
past
fortnight
and
very
little
of
it
could
be
got
from
cologne
as
there
was
a
scarcity
of
it
there
also
coupled
with
an
extraordinary
demand
it
was
also
stated
that
the
monks
at
the
monastery
had
to
erase
the
works
of
virgil
in
order
to
find
material
for
making
a
copy
of
the
homilies
of
john
chrysostom
which
was
wanted
for
the
bishop
of
metz
in
like
manner
it
was
decided
to
erase
the
histories
of
labanius
and
zozirnus
as
being
cheaper
than
procuring
original
parchment
on
which
to
transcribe
a
fine
greek
copy
of
the
whole
bible
to
take
the
place
of
one
destroyed
by
the
late
war
the
heavy
purchase
that
brother
giestfacher
had
made
created
a
panic
in
the
vellum
market
that
was
already
felt
in
the
heart
of
burgundy
the
business
had
also
experienced
a
revulsion
people
of
the
world
who
wanted
testamentary
and
legal
documents
deeds
contracts
and
the
like
properly
engrossed
were
offering
fabulous
sums
to
have
the
work
done
as
most
of
the
professionals
of
that
class
were
now
engaged
by
the
society
and
had
no
time
to
do
any
other
sort
of
writing
a
debate
sprung
up
as
to
the
proper
disposition
to
be
made
of
the
four
bibles
on
hand
and
also
as
to
the
manner
of
beginning
and
conducting
the
distribution
in
view
of
the
demand
for
the
written
word
and
of
the
scarcity
of
copies
and
the
high
price
of
parchment
it
was
suggested
by
heuck
to
sell
them
and
divide
the
proceeds
among
the
poor
and
the
cripples
left
after
the
late
war
five
hundred
dollars
each
could
be
readily
got
for
the
books
he
said
and
it
was
extremely
doubtful
whether
those
who
would
get
them
as
gifts
from
the
society
would
resist
the
temptation
of
selling
them
to
the
first
purchaser
that
came
along
in
addition
to
this
heavy
reason
in
favor
of
his
line
of
policy
heuck
suggested
the
possibility
of
trouble
arising
when
they
should
come
to
grapple
with
the
huge
difficulties
of
actual
distribution
to
give
one
of
those
volumes
he
said
would
be
like
giving
an
estate
and
making
a
man
wealthy
for
life
giestfacher
said
it
would
be
impracticable
to
make
any
private
distribution
among
the
destitute
for
some
time
the
guilds
of
coopers
tailors
shoemakers
armorers
fullers
tanners
masons
artificers
and
others
should
be
first
supplied
and
in
addition
to
the
bible
kept
chained
in
the
for
all
who
wished
to
read
he
would
have
one
placed
at
the
and
one
at
the
so
that
the
thirsty
might
also
drink
the
waters
of
life
and
those
who
were
seeking
justice
at
the
court
might
ascertain
the
law
of
god
before
going
in
blum
said
another
collection
would
have
to
be
raised
to
erect
a
shed
over
the
bibles
that
were
proposed
to
be
placed
at
the
and
at
the
and
to
pay
for
suitable
chains
and
clasps
to
secure
them
from
the
depredations
of
the
pilfering
esch
was
of
opinion
that
another
subscription
could
not
be
successfully
taken
up
until
their
work
had
produced
manifest
fruit
for
good
the
people
have
much
faith
but
when
they
find
salt
mixed
with
their
drink
instead
of
honey
credulity
is
turned
into
disgust
a
bible
chained
to
the
will
be
a
sad
realization
of
their
extravagant
hopes
every
man
who
subscribed
five
dollars
expects
to
get
a
book
worth
five
hundred
an
illuminated
bible
fit
for
a
cathedral
church
he
warned
them
that
they
were
getting
into
a
labyrinth
and
that
they
would
have
to
resort
to
prayer
yet
to
carry
them
through
in
safety
werner
thought
it
would
be
wisest
to
pursue
a
quiescent
policy
for
some
time
and
to
forego
the
indulgence
of
their
anxious
desire
for
palpable
results
until
they
should
be
in
a
condition
to
make
an
impression
he
advocated
the
wisdom
of
delay
they
also
serve
he
said
who
only
stand
and
wait
and
it
might
prove
an
unwise
proceeding
to
come
out
with
their
public
exhibition
just
then
in
a
few
months
when
thirty
or
forty
bibles
would
be
on
hand
a
larger
number
than
could
be
found
in
any
library
in
the
world
they
might
hope
by
the
show
of
so
much
labor
to
create
enthusiasm
still
urged
heuck
will
have
the
difficulty
to
contend
with
who
is
to
get
them
will
remarked
blum
a
greater
difficulty
to
contend
with
about
that
time
the
settlement
of
obligations
for
parchment
and
the
pay
of
the
scriveners
who
are
employed
in
transcribing
our
means
at
present
even
if
we
pay
the
scriveners
but
their
wages
will
not
suffice
to
bring
out
twenty
volumes
so
we
are
just
in
this
difficulty
in
order
to
do
something
we
must
have
means
and
in
order
to
get
means
we
must
do
something
it
is
a
sort
of
vicious
circle
projected
from
logic
into
finance
it
will
take
the
genius
of
brother
giestfacher
to
cut
this
work
said
giestfacher
which
we
are
engaged
is
of
such
merit
that
it
will
stand
of
itself
i
have
no
fears
of
ultimate
triumph
if
you
all
fail
god
and
i
will
carry
it
on
heaven
is
in
it
i
am
in
it
it
must
succeed
i
am
a
little
oldish
i
confess
but
there
is
twenty
years
of
work
in
me
still
i
feel
my
foot
sufficiently
sure
to
tread
the
perilous
path
of
this
adventure
to
the
us
interposed
schwartz
this
profitless
debate
and
give
a
cheer
to
brother
giestfacher
he
is
the
blood
and
the
bone
of
this
movement
we
are
in
with
him
we
are
all
in
the
same
boat
if
we
have
discovered
a
pusillanimous
simpleton
among
us
it
is
not
too
late
to
cast
him
out
i
feel
my
gorge
and
my
strength
rise
together
and
i
swear
to
you
by
remigius
brethren
that
i
am
prepared
to
sink
or
swim
and
whoever
attempts
to
scuttle
the
ship
shall
himself
perish
two
or
three
other
brethren
feeling
the
peculiar
inspiration
of
the
moment
rose
up
and
stamping
their
feet
on
the
floor
proclaimed
their
adherence
to
the
principles
of
the
society
and
vowed
to
see
it
through
to
the
end
this
meeting
then
adjourned
there
is
no
minute
of
any
subsequent
meeting
to
be
found
among
the
manuscripts
that
i
have
consulted
but
i
discovered
a
statement
made
by
heuck
dated
six
months
later
who
being
called
before
the
municipal
authorities
to
testify
what
he
knew
about
certain
transactions
of
a
number
of
men
that
had
banded
themselves
together
secretly
for
the
purpose
of
creating
a
panic
in
the
vellum
market
and
of
disturbing
the
business
of
the
scriveners
said
he
was
one
of
fourteen
citizens
interested
in
the
promulgation
of
the
gospel
free
to
the
poor
that
after
five
or
six
meetings
he
left
the
society
in
company
with
two
others
that
two
of
the
members
became
obnoxious
and
were
expelled
the
one
dusch
for
embezzling
money
collected
for
and
purposes
the
other
werner
for
having
retained
one
of
their
volumes
and
disposed
of
it
to
the
lord
of
drachenfels
for
four
hundred
dollars
that
they
did
not
pursue
and
prosecute
these
delinquents
for
fear
of
bringing
reproach
on
the
project
and
then
he
went
on
to
state
left
the
society
voluntarily
and
in
disgust
we
had
fourteen
bibles
on
hand
but
could
not
agree
about
their
distribution
they
were
too
valuable
to
give
away
for
nothing
and
it
was
discovered
that
they
were
all
written
in
latin
and
not
in
the
vernacular
and
they
would
prove
of
as
little
value
to
the
great
mass
of
people
for
whom
they
were
originally
designed
as
if
they
had
been
written
in
hebrew
in
addition
to
this
i
found
for
i
understand
the
language
perfectly
that
no
two
of
them
were
alike
and
in
conjunction
with
scrivener
schwartz
i
minutely
examined
one
taken
at
random
from
the
pile
and
compared
it
with
the
volume
at
the
cathedral
we
found
fifteen
hundred
discrepancies
in
some
places
whole
sentences
were
left
out
in
others
words
were
made
to
express
a
different
sense
from
the
original
in
others
letters
were
omitted
or
put
in
redundantly
in
such
a
way
as
to
change
the
meaning
and
the
grammatical
structure
was
villanously
bad
seeing
that
the
volumes
were
of
no
use
as
a
representation
of
the
word
of
god
and
being
conscientiously
convinced
that
the
books
contained
poison
for
the
people
instead
of
medicine
i
made
a
motion
in
meeting
to
have
them
all
burned
schwartz
opposed
it
on
the
ground
that
they
were
innoxious
anyhow
there
being
none
of
the
common
people
capable
of
understanding
the
language
in
which
they
were
written
and
though
they
were
a
failure
as
bibles
the
vellum
might
be
again
used
and
as
the
scriveners
were
not
paid
for
their
labor
they
had
a
claim
upon
the
volumes
the
scriveners
got
the
books
to
which
in
my
opinion
they
had
no
just
claim
for
the
villanous
bad
work
they
did
on
them
deserved
censure
and
not
pay
i
have
heard
since
that
some
of
those
scriveners
made
wealth
by
selling
the
books
to
englishmen
for
genuine
and
carefully
prepared
transcripts
from
authorized
texts
the
president
and
founder
of
the
society
giestfacher
is
now
in
jail
for
debt
he
having
failed
to
meet
his
obligations
for
the
vellum
he
purchased
when
he
took
it
into
his
head
to
enlighten
mankind
more
especially
that
portion
of
it
that
dwells
on
the
rhine
adjacent
to
the
city
of
bonn
by
distributing
corrupt
copies
of
latin
bibles
to
poor
people
who
are
not
well
able
to
read
their
own
language
the
still
occupies
the
brains
and
energies
of
three
or
four
enthusiasts
who
have
already
arrived
at
the
conclusion
that
the
apostles
were
in
league
with
hell
to
keep
the
people
ignorant
because
they
did
not
give
every
man
a
copy
of
the
bible
the
founder
sent
me
a
letter
two
days
ago
in
which
he
complains
of
being
deserted
by
his
companions
in
his
extremity
his
creditors
have
seized
on
all
his
goods
and
there
is
a
considerable
sum
yet
unpaid
he
blames
the
pope
and
the
bishop
in
unmeasured
terms
for
this
says
it
is
a
conspiracy
to
keep
the
bible
from
the
people
he
sees
no
prospect
of
being
released
unless
the
members
of
the
society
come
to
his
speedy
relief
the
principles
he
says
for
which
he
suffers
will
yet
triumph
the
time
will
come
when
bibles
will
be
multiplied
by
some
cheap
and
easy
process
until
then
the
common
run
of
humanity
must
be
satisfied
to
be
damned
drawing
what
little
consolation
they
may
from
the
expectation
that
their
descendants
a
few
centuries
hence
will
enjoy
the
slim
privilege
of
reading
bibles
prepared
with
as
little
regard
to
accuracy
as
these
were
i
am
sorry
to
see
such
a
noble
intellect
as
giestfacher
undoubtedly
possesses
show
signs
of
aberration
the
entire
failure
of
his
project
was
more
than
he
could
bear
he
had
centred
his
hopes
upon
it
he
indulged
dreams
of
fame
and
greatness
arising
out
of
the
triumph
of
his
idea
esch
has
become
an
atheist
he
says
the
god
would
not
have
given
a
book
to
be
the
guide
and
dependence
of
man
for
salvation
and
yet
allow
nature
an
inferior
creation
to
interpose
insuperable
barriers
to
its
promulgation
every
time
a
is
destroyed
says
esch
a
community
is
damned
the
dearness
and
scarcity
of
parchment
keep
the
world
in
ignorance
braunn
says
the
world
can
not
be
saved
except
by
a
special
revelation
to
every
individual
for
there
is
hardly
a
copy
of
the
bible
without
errors
so
that
whether
every
human
creature
got
one
or
not
they
would
be
still
unsafe
one
of
the
common
herd
must
learn
latin
and
greek
and
hebrew
well
and
then
spend
a
lifetime
tracing
up
through
all
its
changes
transcriptions
and
corruptions
of
idiom
one
chapter
or
at
most
one
book
and
die
before
he
be
fully
assured
of
the
soundness
of
one
text
a
paragraph
a
line
a
word
in
fact
says
braunn
there
can
be
no
certainty
about
anything
language
may
have
had
altogether
a
different
meaning
twelve
hundred
years
ago
to
what
it
has
now
braunn
and
schwartz
and
myself
wanted
to
have
a
committee
of
five
of
our
number
appointed
to
revise
and
correct
the
text
of
each
book
that
was
produced
by
comparing
it
with
such
greek
and
hebrew
copies
as
were
represented
of
sound
and
correct
authority
but
giestfacher
laughed
at
us
saying
we
knew
nothing
of
greek
or
hebrew
that
we
would
have
to
hire
some
monks
to
do
the
job
for
us
which
would
be
going
back
again
to
the
very
places
and
principles
and
practices
against
which
we
had
revolted
and
protested
moreover
continued
giestfacher
we
can
not
tell
whether
the
oldest
most
original
copies
that
can
be
found
are
true
in
every
particular
how
can
we
know
from
any
sort
of
mere
human
testimony
that
this
copy
or
that
is
in
accordance
with
what
the
prophets
and
apostles
wrote
the
whole
bible
may
be
wrong
as
far
as
our
as
such
is
able
to
testify
we
are
reduced
to
in
this
connection
and
must
rest
on
that
alone
thought
and
so
did
schwartz
that
the
faith
of
giestfacher
must
be
peculiar
when
it
could
accept
copies
as
good
enough
and
true
enough
after
we
had
discovered
hundreds
of
palpable
and
grievous
errors
in
them
a
book
of
romance
would
do
a
person
of
temper
as
well
as
the
bible
faith
being
capable
of
making
up
for
all
deficiencies
i
saw
that
an
extravagance
of
credulity
called
faith
on
the
part
of
giestfacher
led
to
monomania
and
a
predominance
of
irrational
reason
on
the
part
of
esch
had
led
to
utter
negation
i
did
not
covet
either
condition
and
i
concluded
to
remain
safe
at
anchor
where
i
had
been
before
rather
than
longer
follow
those
adventurers
in
a
wild
career
after
a
fancied
good
a
mere
phantom
of
their
own
creation
i
lost
dollars
by
the
temporary
madness
that
can
not
be
recalled
i
rejoice
that
i
lost
no
more
and
i
am
grateful
that
the
hallucination
which
lasted
nearly
a
year
has
passed
away
without
any
permanent
the
remainder
of
statement
had
partially
faded
from
the
parchment
by
time
and
dampness
and
could
not
be
accurately
made
out
sufficient
was
left
visible
however
to
show
that
he
expressed
a
desire
to
be
held
excusable
for
whatever
injuries
to
souls
might
result
from
the
grave
errors
that
existed
in
the
bibles
disseminated
by
the
cupidity
of
the
scriveners
with
the
guilty
knowledge
of
such
errors
i
interested
myself
in
rescuing
from
oblivion
such
parts
of
the
record
of
those
curious
mediæval
transactions
as
served
to
show
to
the
people
of
later
times
what
extraordinary
mental
and
religious
activity
existed
in
those
ages
when
it
was
foolishly
and
stupidly
thought
there
were
but
henchmen
and
slaves
on
the
one
side
and
bloody
mailed
despots
on
the
other
the
arrogance
of
more
favored
epochs
has
characterized
those
days
by
the
epithet
of
pride
is
apt
to
be
blind
the
characterization
is
unjust
all
the
lights
of
science
could
not
come
in
one
blaze
the
people
of
those
days
looked
back
upon
a
period
anterior
to
their
own
as
and
those
looked
still
further
backward
upon
greater
obscurity
as
they
thought
the
universal
boastfulness
of
man
accounts
for
this
increasing
obscurity
as
we
reach
back
into
antiquity
philosophers
and
poets
and
men
of
learning
thinking
themselves
and
wishing
to
have
other
people
think
them
above
personal
egotism
adopted
the
method
of
praising
their
age
and
thus
indirectly
eulogizing
themselves
and
as
they
could
not
compare
their
times
with
the
future
of
which
they
knew
nothing
they
naturally
fell
into
the
unfilial
crime
of
drawing
disparaging
comparisons
with
their
fathers
there
is
an
inclination
too
in
the
imperfection
of
human
nature
to
belittle
what
is
remote
and
magnify
what
is
near
at
hand
even
now
men
as
enthusiastic
and
conscientious
and
religious
as
heuck
and
giestfacher
and
schwartz
find
themselves
surrounded
by
the
same
difficulties
and
as
deeply
at
a
loss
to
advance
a
valid
reason
for
their
revolt
and
their
protest
early
persecutions
of
the
christians
in
one
of
his
bold
apologies
the
great
african
writer
tertullian
said
to
the
rulers
of
the
roman
empire
that
was
one
and
the
same
thing
for
the
truth
of
christianity
to
be
announced
to
the
world
and
for
the
world
to
hate
and
persecute
this
persecution
of
the
church
began
on
the
very
spot
that
was
her
for
soon
after
the
ascension
of
our
lord
the
wicked
jews
tried
by
every
means
to
crush
her
the
days
of
the
apostles
wrote
tertullian
in
the
iiid
century
synagogue
has
been
a
source
of
at
first
the
church
was
attacked
by
words
only
but
these
were
soon
replaced
by
weapons
when
stephen
was
stoned
the
apostles
were
thrown
into
prison
and
scourged
and
all
the
east
had
risen
in
commotion
against
the
christians
the
gentiles
soon
followed
the
example
of
the
jews
and
those
persecutions
which
bore
an
official
character
throughout
the
roman
empire
and
lasted
for
three
centuries
are
commonly
called
the
ten
general
persecutions
besides
these
there
were
partial
persecutions
at
all
times
in
some
part
or
other
of
the
empire
nero
whose
name
is
synonymous
with
cruelty
was
the
first
emperor
to
begin
a
general
persecution
of
the
christians
and
tertullian
made
a
strong
point
in
his
favor
when
he
cried
out
to
the
people
saying
our
troubles
began
at
such
a
source
we
glory
for
whoever
has
studied
his
nature
knows
well
that
nothing
but
what
is
good
and
great
was
ever
condemned
by
this
persecution
began
in
the
year
and
lasted
four
years
its
pretext
was
the
burning
of
rome
the
work
of
the
emperor
himself
who
ambitiously
desired
when
he
would
have
rebuilt
the
city
and
made
it
still
more
grand
to
call
it
by
his
own
name
but
the
plan
not
succeeding
he
tried
to
avert
the
odium
of
the
deed
from
his
own
person
and
accused
the
christians
their
extermination
was
decreed
the
pagan
historian
tacitus
has
mentioned
in
his
xv
some
of
the
principal
torments
inflicted
on
the
christians
he
says
that
they
were
covered
with
the
skins
of
wild
beasts
and
torn
to
pieces
by
savage
hounds
were
crucified
were
burned
alive
and
that
some
being
coated
with
resinous
substances
were
put
up
in
the
imperial
garden
at
night
to
serve
as
human
torches
the
makes
a
special
commemoration
on
the
of
june
of
these
martyrs
for
having
all
been
disciples
of
the
apostles
and
the
firstlings
of
the
christian
flock
which
the
church
in
rome
presented
to
the
lord
in
this
persecution
peter
was
crucified
with
his
head
downwards
paul
was
beheaded
and
among
the
other
more
illustrious
victims
we
find
mark
the
evangelist
thecla
the
first
martyr
of
her
sex
ss
gervase
and
protase
at
milan
vitalis
at
ravenna
and
polycetus
at
saragossa
in
spain
the
number
of
the
slain
and
the
hitherto
cruelties
practised
upon
them
moved
to
pity
many
of
the
heathen
and
the
sight
of
so
much
fortitude
for
a
principle
of
religion
was
the
means
through
divine
grace
of
many
conversions
after
this
as
after
every
succeeding
persecution
the
great
truth
spoken
by
tertullian
was
exemplified
that
the
blood
of
the
martyrs
was
the
seed
of
christians
by
a
law
of
the
empire
which
was
not
revoked
until
nearly
three
hundred
years
afterwards
under
constantine
the
profession
of
the
christian
religion
was
made
a
capital
offence
this
law
it
is
true
was
not
enforced
at
all
times
especially
under
benign
or
indifferent
rulers
but
it
hung
continually
suspended
over
the
heads
of
the
christians
like
a
sword
of
damocles
the
second
persecution
was
that
of
domitian
from
to
tertullian
calls
him
portion
of
nero
by
his
at
first
he
only
imposed
heavy
fines
upon
the
wealthy
christians
but
thirsting
for
blood
he
soon
published
more
cruel
edicts
against
them
among
his
noblest
victims
were
his
flavius
clemens
a
man
of
consular
dignity
john
the
evangelist
who
was
thrown
into
a
caldron
of
boiling
oil
from
which
however
he
miraculously
escaped
unhurt
andrew
the
apostle
dionysius
the
areopagite
and
onesimus
convert
hegesippus
quoted
by
eusebius
in
his
has
recorded
a
very
interesting
fact
about
the
children
of
jude
surnamed
thaddeus
in
the
gospel
telling
us
that
having
confessed
the
faith
under
this
reign
they
were
always
honored
in
the
church
of
jerusalem
not
alone
as
martyrs
but
as
relatives
of
jesus
christ
according
to
the
flesh
the
third
persecution
was
from
to
in
answer
to
a
letter
from
his
friend
pliny
the
younger
who
had
command
in
asia
minor
the
emperor
ordered
that
the
christians
were
not
to
be
sought
out
but
that
if
accused
and
they
remained
obstinate
in
their
faith
they
were
to
be
put
to
death
under
an
appearance
of
mercy
a
large
field
was
opened
for
the
cruelty
and
exactions
of
roman
officials
which
they
were
not
slow
to
work
a
single
circumstance
attests
the
severity
of
the
persecution
this
was
that
the
tiberian
governor
of
palestine
wrote
to
the
emperor
complaining
of
the
odious
duty
imposed
upon
him
since
the
christians
were
forthcoming
in
greater
numbers
than
he
could
without
tiring
have
executed
the
persecution
was
particularly
severe
in
the
east
simeon
bishop
of
jerusalem
ignatius
of
antioch
and
the
virgin
domitilla
who
was
related
to
three
emperors
are
among
the
more
illustrious
martyrs
of
the
period
next
came
the
persecution
of
hadrian
lasting
from
to
about
we
have
the
authority
of
jerome
for
saying
that
it
was
very
violent
this
emperor
was
a
coward
and
perhaps
as
a
consequence
intensely
superstitious
one
of
his
particular
grievances
against
the
christians
was
that
they
professed
a
religion
in
which
he
had
no
share
under
him
perished
with
countless
others
pope
alexander
and
his
priests
eventius
and
theodulus
eustace
a
celebrated
general
with
his
wife
and
little
children
symphorosa
and
her
seven
sons
zoe
with
her
husband
and
two
children
the
fifth
was
the
persecution
of
marcus
aurelius
although
he
was
by
nature
well
inclined
he
was
certainly
the
author
of
much
innocent
bloodshed
which
may
be
in
part
ascribed
to
the
powerful
influence
of
the
philosophers
whose
company
and
tone
he
affected
the
persecution
raged
most
severely
among
the
gauls
and
elsewhere
we
find
the
illustrious
names
of
justin
the
great
apologist
polycarp
bishop
of
smyrna
and
felicitas
and
her
seven
children
followed
the
persecution
of
septimius
severus
which
lasted
from
to
and
was
so
extremely
violent
that
many
christians
believed
antichrist
had
come
it
reaped
from
the
church
such
distinguished
persons
as
pope
victor
at
rome
leonidas
father
of
the
great
origen
at
alexandria
irenæus
and
companions
at
lyons
perpetua
and
felicitas
in
mauritania
egypt
was
particularly
rich
in
holy
martyrs
after
this
one
came
the
persecution
of
maximinus
from
to
it
was
in
the
beginning
more
especially
directed
against
the
sacred
ministers
of
the
church
several
popes
were
put
to
death
and
among
the
inferior
clergy
we
find
the
deacon
ambrose
who
was
the
bosom
friend
of
origen
and
one
of
his
principal
assistants
in
his
work
on
the
holy
scriptures
the
persecution
of
decius
lasted
from
to
the
christians
in
spite
of
all
repressive
measures
had
steadily
increased
in
numbers
but
this
emperor
thought
to
do
what
his
predecessors
had
failed
in
and
was
hardly
seated
on
the
throne
before
he
published
most
cruel
edicts
against
them
among
the
more
celebrated
names
of
this
persecution
are
those
of
popes
fabian
and
cornelius
saturninus
first
bishop
of
toulouse
babylas
bishop
of
antioch
the
famous
christopher
in
lycia
about
whom
there
is
a
beautiful
legend
and
the
noble
virgin
agatha
in
sicily
the
great
scholar
origen
was
put
to
the
torture
during
this
persecution
but
escaped
death
like
maximinus
this
emperor
singled
out
the
heads
of
the
various
local
churches
the
most
active
and
learned
ministers
the
highest
of
both
sexes
in
the
social
scale
aiming
less
at
the
death
than
the
apostasy
of
christians
hoping
in
this
way
to
destroy
the
faith
whence
cyprian
laments
in
one
of
his
epistles
that
the
christians
suffer
atrocious
torments
without
the
final
consolation
of
martyrdom
one
effect
of
this
persecution
was
of
immense
benefit
to
the
church
in
the
east
for
paul
surnamed
first
hermit
took
refuge
from
the
storm
in
upper
egypt
where
he
peopled
by
his
example
the
region
around
thebes
with
those
holy
anchorites
since
called
the
fathers
of
the
desert
the
ninth
persecution
was
that
of
valerian
who
although
at
first
favorable
to
the
christians
became
one
of
their
greatest
opposers
at
the
instigation
of
their
sworn
enemy
marcian
at
this
date
we
find
upon
the
list
of
martyrs
the
eminent
names
of
popes
stephen
and
sixtus
lawrence
the
roman
deacon
and
cyprian
the
great
convert
and
bishop
of
carthage
the
persecution
of
diocletian
was
the
last
and
the
bloodiest
of
all
it
raged
from
to
maximian
the
colleague
had
already
put
to
death
many
christians
and
among
others
on
the
of
september
maurice
and
his
theban
legion
before
the
persecution
became
general
throughout
the
roman
empire
it
began
in
this
form
at
nicomedia
on
occasion
of
a
fire
that
consumed
a
part
of
the
imperial
palace
and
which
was
maliciously
ascribed
to
the
christians
and
it
is
remarkable
that
the
two
extreme
persecutions
of
the
early
church
should
both
have
begun
with
a
false
charge
of
incendiarism
diocletian
used
to
sit
upon
his
throne
at
nicomedia
watching
the
of
his
christian
subjects
who
were
being
burned
not
singly
but
in
great
crowds
many
officers
and
servants
of
his
household
perished
and
to
distinguish
them
from
the
rest
they
were
dropped
into
the
sea
with
large
stones
fastened
about
their
necks
a
special
object
of
the
persecutors
was
to
destroy
the
churches
and
tombs
of
earlier
martyrs
to
seize
the
vessels
used
in
the
holy
sacrifice
and
to
burn
the
liturgical
books
and
the
holy
scriptures
the
makes
a
particular
mention
on
the
of
january
of
those
who
suffered
death
rather
than
deliver
up
these
books
to
the
tyrant
although
innumerable
copies
of
the
scriptures
perished
not
a
few
were
saved
and
new
copies
multiplied
either
by
favor
of
the
less
stringent
executors
of
the
law
or
because
the
privilege
was
bought
by
the
faithful
at
a
great
price
some
years
ago
the
german
biblical
critic
tischendorf
discovered
on
mount
sinai
a
greek
codex
of
extraordinary
antiquity
and
only
two
removes
from
an
original
of
origen
it
is
connected
with
one
of
the
celebrated
martyrs
of
this
persecution
and
bears
upon
what
we
have
just
said
of
the
sacred
scriptures
in
this
codex
at
the
end
of
the
book
of
esther
there
is
a
note
attesting
that
the
copy
was
collated
with
a
very
ancient
manuscript
that
had
itself
been
corrected
by
the
hand
of
the
blessed
martyr
pamphilus
priest
of
cæsarea
in
palestine
while
in
prison
assisted
by
antoninus
his
who
read
for
him
from
a
copy
of
the
hexapla
of
origen
which
had
been
revised
by
that
author
himself
the
touching
spectacle
of
these
two
men
both
of
whom
gave
their
blood
for
the
faith
occupied
in
the
midst
of
the
inconveniences
pain
and
weariness
of
captivity
in
transcribing
good
copies
of
the
bible
is
one
of
the
many
instances
discovered
in
every
age
showing
the
care
that
the
church
has
had
to
multiply
and
guard
from
error
the
holy
written
word
of
god
among
the
petty
sources
of
annoyance
during
this
persecution
was
the
difficulty
of
procuring
food
drink
or
raiment
that
had
not
been
offered
to
idols
for
the
pagan
priests
had
set
up
statues
of
their
divinities
in
all
the
hostelries
and
shops
and
at
the
private
and
public
fountains
they
used
also
to
go
around
city
and
country
sprinkling
with
superstitious
lustral
water
the
gardens
vineyards
orchards
and
fields
so
as
to
put
the
christians
to
the
greatest
straits
to
obtain
anything
that
had
not
been
polluted
in
this
manner
we
learn
from
the
acts
of
theodotus
a
christian
tradesman
of
ancyra
the
obstacles
he
had
to
surmount
at
this
time
to
procure
pure
bread
and
wine
to
be
used
by
the
priests
in
the
mass
we
can
appreciate
the
intense
severity
of
this
persecution
in
many
ways
but
one
of
the
most
singular
proofs
of
it
is
that
pagans
in
spain
inscribed
upon
a
marble
monument
erected
in
honor
he
had
abolished
the
very
name
of
this
emperor
had
also
the
rare
but
unenviable
privilege
of
giving
his
name
to
a
new
chronological
period
called
by
the
pagans
in
compliment
to
his
bloody
zeal
for
their
rites
the
era
of
diocletian
but
the
christians
called
it
the
era
of
the
martyrs
it
began
on
the
of
august
and
was
long
in
use
in
egypt
and
abyssinia
some
of
the
more
renowned
victims
of
this
persecution
are
sebastian
an
imperial
officer
agnes
a
roman
virgin
lucy
a
virgin
of
syracuse
and
the
forty
martyrs
of
sebaste
it
may
be
interesting
to
note
briefly
the
chief
causes
of
so
much
cruel
bloodshed
even
under
princes
of
undoubted
moderation
in
the
general
government
of
affairs
as
were
trajan
marcus
aurelius
antoninus
the
pious
and
a
few
others
the
most
continual
if
not
the
deepest
source
of
persecution
were
the
passions
of
the
populace
calumny
of
the
subtlest
and
most
popular
kind
and
pressed
at
all
times
with
patient
effort
had
so
inflamed
the
minds
of
the
brutal
lower
classes
that
only
a
word
or
a
sign
was
required
to
set
them
upon
the
christians
these
were
called
disloyal
to
the
empire
unfriendly
to
the
princes
of
a
foreign
religion
people
who
refused
to
fall
into
the
ways
of
the
majority
and
enemies
of
the
human
race
from
the
remains
of
ancient
histories
from
the
acts
of
martyrs
from
pagan
inscriptions
and
from
other
sources
more
than
different
opprobrious
qualifications
applied
to
the
christians
as
a
body
have
been
counted
up
but
when
particular
calumnies
became
any
way
stale
the
christians
could
always
be
accused
as
the
cause
of
every
calamity
that
befell
the
state
so
that
in
the
words
of
tertullian
the
tiber
exceeded
its
limits
if
the
nile
did
not
rise
to
irrigate
the
fields
if
the
rain
failed
to
fall
if
the
earth
quaked
if
famine
or
pestilence
scourged
the
land
at
once
the
cry
was
raised
christians
to
the
lions
the
next
most
constant
source
of
trouble
was
the
pernicious
influence
of
the
philosophers
a
set
of
men
who
pretended
to
be
seekers
after
wisdom
and
distinguished
themselves
from
the
vulgar
by
a
certain
style
of
dress
puffed
up
as
they
were
with
their
own
knowledge
nothing
irritated
their
pride
so
much
as
that
men
of
the
despised
christian
class
should
presume
to
dispute
their
doctrines
and
teach
that
profane
philosophy
was
naught
since
man
could
not
be
made
perfect
by
human
wisdom
but
only
by
the
testimony
of
christ
who
was
crucified
among
the
christians
too
a
special
order
of
men
whom
we
call
apologists
and
among
whom
we
count
justin
tertullian
tatian
arnobius
minutius
felix
origen
aristides
quadratus
athenagoras
and
miltiades
the
chief
exposed
in
their
eloquent
writings
the
vanity
contradictions
and
vices
of
their
opponents
succeeding
sometimes
in
silencing
false
accusations
and
even
in
arresting
the
course
of
persecution
their
apologies
and
memorials
form
one
of
the
most
instructive
branches
of
early
christian
literature
and
are
a
considerable
compensation
for
the
loss
of
so
many
acts
of
martyrs
and
other
venerable
documents
destroyed
by
the
pagans
or
which
have
otherwise
perished
the
third
great
cause
of
persecution
was
found
to
use
a
comparatively
modern
word
in
the
erastianism
of
the
roman
empire
the
emperor
was
by
right
of
the
purple
and
no
religion
was
recognized
that
did
not
profess
its
existence
and
authority
dependent
upon
the
state
naturally
a
religion
whose
followers
would
reply
to
every
iniquitous
command
ought
to
obey
god
rather
than
men
could
expect
no
mercy
but
only
continual
war
sometimes
the
christians
were
put
to
death
in
the
same
manner
as
the
common
malefactors
such
as
by
decapitation
crucifixion
or
scourging
sometimes
in
the
manner
reserved
for
particular
classes
of
criminals
as
being
hurled
down
a
precipice
drowned
devoured
by
wild
beasts
left
to
starve
but
sometimes
also
the
exquisite
cruelty
of
the
persecutors
delighted
to
feed
upon
the
sufferings
of
its
victims
and
make
dying
as
long
and
painful
as
possible
thus
there
are
innumerable
examples
of
christians
being
flayed
alive
the
skin
being
neatly
cut
off
in
long
strips
and
pepper
or
vinegar
rubbed
into
the
raw
flesh
or
slowly
crushed
between
two
large
stones
or
having
molten
lead
poured
down
the
throat
some
christians
were
tied
to
stakes
in
the
ground
and
gored
to
death
by
wild
bulls
or
thinly
smeared
with
honey
and
exposed
under
a
broiling
sun
to
the
insects
which
would
be
attracted
some
were
tied
to
the
tails
of
vicious
horses
and
dragged
to
pieces
some
were
sewed
up
in
sacks
with
vipers
scorpions
or
other
venomous
things
and
thrown
into
the
water
some
had
their
members
violently
torn
from
the
trunk
of
the
body
some
were
tortured
by
fire
in
ways
almost
unknown
to
the
most
savage
indians
of
america
some
were
slowly
scourged
to
death
with
whips
made
of
several
bronze
chainlets
at
the
extremity
of
each
of
which
was
a
jagged
bullet
while
jerking
out
of
the
teeth
in
slow
succession
cutting
off
the
nose
ears
lips
and
breasts
tearing
of
the
flesh
with
hot
pincers
sticking
sharp
sticks
up
under
the
being
held
suspended
head
downward
over
a
smoking
fire
stretching
upon
a
rack
and
breaking
upon
the
wheel
were
some
only
of
the
commonest
tortures
that
preceded
the
final
by
sword
or
lance
many
instruments
used
in
tormenting
the
martyrs
have
been
found
at
different
times
and
are
now
carefully
preserved
in
collections
of
christian
antiquities
and
from
these
from
descriptions
and
from
the
rude
representations
on
the
tombs
of
martyrs
in
the
catacombs
it
is
known
positively
that
over
one
hundred
different
modes
of
torture
were
used
upon
the
christians
from
the
earliest
period
particular
pains
were
taken
by
the
pastors
of
the
church
to
have
the
remains
of
the
martyrs
collected
and
some
account
of
their
sufferings
consigned
to
letters
and
pope
clement
a
disciple
of
the
apostle
peter
instituted
a
college
of
notaries
one
for
each
of
the
seven
ecclesiastical
districts
into
which
he
had
divided
rome
with
the
special
charge
of
collecting
with
diligence
all
the
information
possible
about
the
martyrs
they
were
not
to
pass
over
even
the
minutest
circumstances
of
their
confession
of
faith
and
death
this
attendance
on
the
last
moments
of
the
martyrs
was
often
accompanied
by
great
personal
risk
or
at
least
a
heavy
expense
in
the
way
of
buying
the
of
venal
officers
but
it
was
a
thing
of
the
utmost
importance
in
view
of
the
doctrine
concerning
the
veneration
and
invocation
of
saints
that
nothing
should
be
left
undone
which
prudence
would
suggest
to
leave
it
beyond
a
doubt
that
the
martyrs
had
confessed
the
faith
and
had
suffered
death
the
faith
the
pagans
soon
discovered
the
value
that
was
set
upon
such
documents
and
very
many
of
them
were
seized
and
destroyed
the
fact
that
the
act
of
the
martyrs
were
objects
of
careful
search
is
so
well
attested
as
is
also
the
other
fact
that
an
immense
number
perished
that
it
is
a
wonder
and
a
grace
of
divine
providence
how
any
however
few
comparatively
have
come
down
to
us
it
has
been
calculated
that
at
least
five
million
christians
men
women
and
children
were
put
to
death
for
the
faith
during
the
first
three
centuries
of
the
church
the
french
historian
ampère
has
very
justly
remarked
that
amidst
the
moral
decay
of
the
roman
empire
when
all
else
was
lust
and
despotism
the
christians
alone
saved
the
dignity
of
human
nature
and
the
spaniard
balmes
when
treating
of
the
progress
of
individuality
under
the
influence
of
catholicity
ch
xxiii
remarks
that
it
was
the
martyrs
who
first
gave
the
great
example
of
proclaiming
that
individual
should
cease
to
acknowledge
power
when
power
exacts
from
him
what
he
believes
to
be
contrary
to
his
the
patience
of
the
martyrs
rebuked
the
sensualism
of
the
pagans
and
their
fearless
assertions
that
matters
of
conscience
are
beyond
the
jurisdiction
of
any
civil
ruler
proved
them
to
be
the
best
friends
of
human
liberty
while
their
constancy
and
number
during
three
hundred
years
of
persecution
that
only
ceased
with
their
triumph
is
one
of
the
solid
arguments
to
prove
that
the
catholic
church
has
a
divine
origin
and
a
sustaining
divinity
within
her
hind
immortal
and
fed
on
the
lawns
and
in
the
forest
without
unspotted
innocent
within
she
no
danger
for
she
knew
no
sin
yet
had
she
oft
been
with
horns
and
hounds
and
scythian
shafts
and
many
wingèd
wounds
at
her
heart
was
often
to
fly
and
to
death
fated
not
to
dryden
the
unremembered
mother
unknown
beloved
thou
whose
shadow
lies
across
the
sunny
threshold
of
my
years
whom
memory
with
eyes
seeks
the
past
but
can
not
find
for
tears
how
bitter
is
the
thought
that
i
thy
child
remember
not
the
touch
the
look
the
tone
which
made
my
young
life
thrill
that
i
alone

yet
i
know
that
if

i
should
find
that
my
poor

hath

aright

duration
time
and
duration
are
usually
considered
synonymous
as
no
duration
is
perceived
by
us
except
the
duration
of
movement
or
of
such
things
as
are
subject
to
movement
and
such
duration
is
time
but
rigorously
speaking
time
and
duration
are
not
synonymous
for
they
are
to
one
another
in
the
same
relation
as
place
and
space
as
no
place
is
possible
without
real
absolute
space
so
no
time
is
possible
without
real
absolute
duration
and
as
place
consists
of
intervals
in
space
so
time
consists
of
intervals
in
duration
yet
there
may
be
duration
independently
of
time
just
as
there
may
be
space
independent
of
places
and
for
this
reason
the
nature
of
duration
must
be
determined
apart
from
the
nature
of
time
in
treating
of
this
subject
we
shall
have
to
answer
a
series
of
questions
altogether
similar
to
those
which
we
have
answered
in
treating
of
space
and
place
hence
we
shall
follow
the
same
order
and
method
in
our
present
treatise
which
we
have
followed
in
our
articles
on
space
with
this
difference
however
that
to
avoid
useless
repetitions
we
will
omit
the
development
of
some
of
those
reasonings
which
the
reader
himself
can
easily
transfer
from
space
to
duration
duration
is
commonly
defined
as
permanence
of
a
being
in
its
rei
in
the
duration
of
a
being
which
perseveres
in
existence
without
any
intrinsic
change
is
called
the
duration
of
a
being
which
is
actually
subject
to
intrinsic
mutations
is
called
flowing
duration
evidently
implies
succession
and
succession
involves
time
for
succession
is
a
relation
between
something
which
follows
and
something
which
precedes
on
the
other
hand
time
also
involves
succession
whence
it
would
seem
that
neither
time
nor
succession
can
be
defined
apart
from
one
another
the
definition
of
the
latter
presupposing
that
of
the
former
and
that
of
the
former
presupposing
the
notion
of
the
latter
although
we
need
not
be
anxious
about
this
point
for
time
and
succession
really
involve
one
another
and
therefore
may
well
be
included
under
the
same
definition
we
must
observe
that
the
notion
of
succession
though
ordinarily
applied
to
duration
extends
to
other
things
also
whenever
they
follow
one
another
in
a
certain
order
thus
the
crust
of
the
earth
is
formed
by
a
succession
of
strata
the
alps
by
a
succession
of
mountains
the
streets
of
the
city
by
a
succession
of
houses
etc
hence
the
notion
of
succession
is
more
general
than
the
notion
of
time
and
consequently
there
must
be
some
means
of
defining
it
independently
of
the
consideration
of
time
balmes
explains
succession
without
mentioning
time
in
the
following
manner
are
things
which
exclude
one
another
from
the
same
subject
and
there
are
other
things
which
do
not
exclude
one
another
from
the
same
subject
the
existence
of
those
things
which
exclude
one
another
implies
succession
take
a
line
a
body
placed
in
can
not
pass
over
to
the
place
without
ceasing
to
be
in
because
the
situation
excludes
the
situation
and
in
a
similar
manner
the
situation
excludes
the
situation
if
then
notwithstanding
this
mutual
exclusion
the
three
places
are
really
occupied
by
the
same
body
there
is
succession
this
shows
that
succession
is
really
nothing
else
than
existence
of
such
things
as
exclude
one
hence
succession
implies
the
existence
of
the
thing
that
excludes
and
the
of
the
things
that
are
excluded
all
variations
involve
some
such
exclusion
hence
all
variations
involve
to
perceive
the
existence
of
things
which
exclude
one
another
is
to
perceive
succession
and
time
to
measure
it
is
to
measure
thus
far
balmes
but
if
the
duration
can
be
easily
conceived
as
the
existence
of
such
things
as
exclude
one
another
the
case
is
very
different
with
regard
to
duration
for
since
we
measure
all
duration
by
time
or
by
successive
intervals
we
can
scarcely
conceive
that
there
may
be
duration
without
succession
even
the
word
which
we
employ
in
the
definition
of
duration
and
which
seems
to
exclude
all
notion
of
change
is
always
associated
in
our
thought
with
succession
and
time
the
difficulty
we
experience
in
forming
a
concept
of
standing
duration
is
as
great
at
least
as
that
which
we
find
in
conceiving
absolute
space
without
formal
extension
and
parts
in
fact
formal
extension
is
to
absolute
space
what
formal
succession
is
to
absolute
standing
duration
to
get
over
this
difficulty
we
shall
have
to
show
that
there
is
a
duration
altogether
independent
of
contingent
changes
as
there
is
a
space
altogether
independent
of
existing
bodies
and
that
the
succession
which
we
observe
in
the
duration
of
created
things
is
not
to
be
found
in
the
fundamental
reason
of
its
existence
as
our
imagination
suggests
but
only
in
the
changes
themselves
which
we
witness
in
created
things
the
following
questions
are
to
be
answered
is
there
any
standing
duration
and
if
so
is
it
an
objective
reality
or
a
mere
negation
of
movement
is
standing
duration
anything
created
what
sort
of
reality
is
it
is
it
modified
by
the
existence
of
creatures
what
is
a
term
of
duration
what
is
relative
duration
what
is
an
interval
of
duration
and
how
is
it
measured
these
questions
are
all
parallel
to
those
which
we
have
answered
in
our
first
and
second
articles
on
space
and
they
admit
of
a
similar
solution
there
any
duration
absolutely
standing
certainly
for
if
there
is
a
being
whose
entity
remains
always
the
same
without
any
intrinsic
change
its
duration
will
be
absolutely
standing
but
there
is
such
a
being
for
there
is
as
we
have
proved
an
infinite
reality
absolutely
immovable
and
unchangeable
that
is
absolute
space
its
permanence
is
therefore
altogether
exempt
from
succession
and
consequently
its
duration
is
absolutely
standing
again
as
there
is
no
movement
in
space
without
immovable
space
so
there
is
no
flowing
in
duration
without
standing
duration
for
as
a
thing
can
not
change
its
ubication
in
space
unless
there
be
a
field
for
real
ubications
between
the
initial
and
the
final
term
of
the
movement
so
a
thing
can
not
change
its
mode
of
being
the
in
duration
unless
there
be
a
field
for
real
modes
of
being
between
the
initial
and
the
final
term
of
its
duration
now
this
real
field
owing
to
the
fact
that
it
is
in
both
cases
prerequired
for
the
possibility
of
the
respective
changes
is
something
necessarily
anterior
to
and
independent
of
any
of
such
changes
therefore
as
the
field
of
all
local
movements
is
anterior
to
all
movements
and
excludes
movement
from
itself
so
also
the
field
of
all
successive
durations
is
anterior
to
all
successivity
and
therefore
excludes
succession
although
these
two
arguments
suffice
to
establish
our
conclusion
what
we
have
to
say
concerning
the
next
question
will
furnish
additional
evidence
in
its
support
standing
duration
an
objective
reality
or
a
mere
abstract
conception
we
answer
that
standing
duration
is
an
objective
reality
as
much
as
absolute
space
for
as
movement
can
not
extend
in
space
if
space
is
nothing
real
so
movement
can
not
extend
in
duration
if
the
field
of
its
extension
is
nothing
real
but
we
have
just
seen
that
the
field
through
which
the
duration
of
movement
extends
is
standing
duration
therefore
standing
duration
is
an
objective
reality
secondly
a
mere
nothing
or
a
mere
fiction
can
not
be
the
foundation
of
real
relations
but
standing
duration
is
the
foundation
of
all
intervals
of
real
succession
which
are
real
relations
therefore
standing
duration
is
not
a
fiction
but
an
objective
reality
the
major
of
this
argument
is
well
known
the
minor
is
proved
thus
in
all
real
relations
the
terms
must
communicate
with
each
other
through
one
and
the
same
reality
and
therefore
the
foundation
of
a
real
relation
must
reach
by
one
and
the
same
reality
the
terms
related
but
the
terms
of
successive
duration
are
and
therefore
the
foundation
of
their
relation
must
reach
both
and
with
one
and
the
same
reality
and
therefore
it
has
neither
nor
in
itself
had
it
and
in
itself
its
would
not
be
its
and
thus
the
reality
by
which
it
would
reach
the
terms
of
succession
would
not
be
the
same
it
is
therefore
manifest
that
the
foundation
of
all
real
intervals
of
succession
is
a
reality
whose
duration
ranges
above
succession
this
proof
may
be
presented
more
concisely
as
follows
succession
is
a
relation
between
two
terms
as
and
its
foundation
must
therefore
reach
all
the
past
as
it
reaches
the
present
but
what
reaches
the
past
as
well
as
the
present
is
always
present
for
if
it
were
past
it
would
be
no
more
and
thus
it
could
not
reach
the
past
and
the
present
therefore
the
foundation
of
succession
has
no
past
but
only
an
invariable
present
therefore
there
is
a
real
standing
duration
a
real
field
over
which
successive
duration
extends
thirdly
in
all
intervals
of
succession
the
is
connected
with
the
through
real
duration
but
this
real
duration
has
in
itself
neither
nor
for
if
it
had
and
it
would
fall
under
the
very
genus
of
relation
of
which
it
is
the
foundation
which
is
evidently
impossible
because
it
would
then
be
the
foundation
of
its
own
entity
it
is
therefore
plain
that
the
real
connection
between
the
and
the
is
made
by
a
reality
which
transcends
all
and
all
and
which
is
nothing
else
than
absolute
standing
duration
fourthly
if
standing
duration
were
not
an
objective
reality
but
a
mere
fiction
or
a
mere
negation
of
movement
there
would
be
no
real
length
of
duration
for
the
terms
of
successive
duration
are
indivisible
and
consequently
they
can
not
give
rise
to
any
continuous
quantity
of
duration
unless
something
lies
between
them
which
affords
a
real
ground
for
continuous
extension
that
the
terms
of
successive
duration
are
indivisible
is
evident
because
the
same
term
can
not
be
before
itself
nor
after
itself
but
is
wholly
confined
to
an
indivisible
instant
now
that
according
to
which
an
interval
of
successive
duration
can
be
extended
from
one
of
these
terms
to
another
is
nothing
but
absolute
and
standing
duration
for
if
it
were
flowing
it
would
pass
away
with
the
passing
terms
and
thus
it
would
not
lie
between
them
as
is
necessary
in
order
to
supply
a
ground
for
the
extension
of
the
interval
intercepted
in
the
same
manner
therefore
as
there
can
not
be
distance
between
two
ubicated
points
without
real
absolute
space
there
can
not
be
an
interval
between
two
terms
in
succession
without
real
absolute
duration
a
fifth
proof
of
the
same
truth
may
be
drawn
from
the
reality
of
the
past
historical
facts
are
real
facts
although
they
are
all
past
there
really
was
a
man
called
solomon
who
really
reigned
in
jerusalem
there
really
was
a
philosopher
called
plato
whose
sublime
doctrines
deserved
for
him
the
surname
of
divine
there
really
was
a
man
called
attila
surnamed
the
scourge
of
god
these
men
existed
in
different
intervals
of
duration
and
they
are
no
more
but
their
past
existence
and
their
distinct
duration
constitute
three
distinct
facts
which
are
even
to
the
present
day
and
such
will
remain
for
ever
now
how
can
we
admit
that
what
has
wholly
ceased
to
exist
in
successive
duration
is
still
a
real
and
indelible
fact
unless
we
admit
that
there
is
an
absolute
duration
which
is
even
now
as
truly
united
with
the
past
as
it
is
with
the
present
and
to
which
the
past
is
not
past
but
perpetually
present
if
there
is
no
such
duration
then
all
the
past
must
have
been
obliterated
and
buried
in
absolute
nothingness
for
if
the
succession
of
past
things
extended
upon
itself
alone
without
any
distinct
ground
upon
which
its
flowing
could
be
registered
none
of
past
things
could
have
left
behind
a
real
mark
of
their
existence
against
this
conclusion
some
will
object
that
the
relation
between
and
may
be
explained
by
a
mere
negation
of
simultaneous
existence
but
the
objection
is
futile
for
the
intervals
of
successive
duration
can
be
greater
or
less
whilst
no
negation
can
be
greater
or
less
which
shows
that
the
negation
of
simultaneous
existence
must
not
be
confounded
with
the
intervals
of
succession
the
following
objection
is
more
plausible
the
duration
of
movement
suffices
to
fill
up
the
whole
interval
of
succession
and
to
measure
its
extent
and
therefore
the
reality
which
connects
the
with
the
is
movement
itself
not
standing
duration
to
this
we
answer
that
the
duration
of
movement
is
essentially
successive
and
relative
and
therefore
it
requires
a
real
foundation
in
something
standing
and
absolute
in
fact
although
every
movement
formally
extends
and
measures
its
own
duration
nevertheless
it
does
not
extend
it
upon
itself
but
upon
a
field
extrinsic
to
itself
and
this
field
is
permanently
the
same
it
is
plain
that
the
beginning
and
the
end
of
movement
can
not
be
connected
in
mutual
relation
through
movement
alone
because
movement
is
always
and
when
it
passes
through
one
term
of
its
duration
it
loses
the
actuality
it
had
in
the
preceding
term
so
that
when
it
reaches
its
last
term
it
has
nothing
left
of
what
it
possessed
in
its
initial
term
or
in
any
other
subsequent
term
this
suffices
to
show
that
although
the
duration
of
the
movement
fills
up
the
whole
interval
yet
owing
to
its
very
successivity
it
can
not
be
assumed
as
the
ground
of
the
relation
intervening
between
its
successive
terms
absolute
and
standing
duration
a
created
or
an
uncreated
reality
this
question
is
easily
answered
for
in
the
first
place
standing
duration
is
the
duration
of
a
being
altogether
unchangeable
and
nothing
unchangeable
is
created
hence
standing
duration
is
an
uncreated
reality
on
the
other
hand
all
that
is
created
is
changeable
and
constantly
subject
to
movement
hence
all
created
that
is
contingent
duration
implies
succession
therefore
standing
duration
is
not
to
be
found
among
created
realities
lastly
standing
duration
as
involving
in
itself
all
conceivable
past
and
all
possible
future
is
infinite
and
as
forming
the
ground
of
all
contingent
actualities
is
nothing
less
than
the
formal
possibility
of
infinite
terms
of
real
successive
duration
but
such
a
possibility
can
be
found
in
god
alone
therefore
the
reality
of
standing
duration
is
in
god
alone
and
we
need
not
add
that
it
must
be
uncreated
reality
then
is
absolute
standing
duration
we
answer
that
this
duration
is
the
infinite
virtuality
or
extrinsic
terminability
of
eternity
for
nowhere
but
in
eternity
can
we
find
the
reason
of
the
possibility
of
infinite
terms
and
intervals
of
duration
of
course
eternity
considered
absolutely
is
nothing
else
than
the
immobility
of
existence
but
its
virtual
comprehension
of
all
possible
terms
of
successive
duration
constitutes
the
absolute
duration
of
existence
inasmuch
as
the
word
expresses
a
virtual
extent
corresponding
to
all
possible
contingent
duration
for
duration
though
formally
simultaneous
virtually
extends
beyond
all
imaginable
terms
and
intervals
of
contingent
duration
hence
standing
duration
is
the
duration
of
eternity
the
first
and
fundamental
ground
of
flowing
duration
the
infinite
range
through
which
the
duration
of
changeable
things
extend
in
other
words
the
infinite
virtuality
of
eternity
as
equivalent
to
an
infinite
length
of
time
is
and
as
excluding
from
itself
all
intrinsic
change
is
duration
this
virtuality
of
eternity
is
really
nothing
else
than
its
extrinsic
terminability
for
eternity
is
conceived
to
correspond
to
all
possible
differences
of
time
only
inasmuch
as
it
can
be
compared
with
the
contingent
terms
by
which
it
can
be
extrinsically
terminated
secondly
if
nothing
had
been
created
there
would
have
been
no
extrinsic
terms
capable
of
extending
successive
duration
but
since
god
would
have
remained
in
his
eternity
there
would
have
remained
the
reality
in
which
all
extrinsic
terms
of
duration
have
their
virtual
being
and
thus
there
would
have
remained
eminently
and
without
formal
succession
in
god
himself
the
duration
of
all
the
beings
possible
outside
of
god
for
he
would
certainly
not
have
ceased
to
exist
in
all
the
instants
of
duration
in
which
creatures
have
existed
the
only
change
would
have
been
this
that
those
instants
owing
to
a
total
absence
of
creatures
would
have
lacked
their
formal
denomination
of
and
their
formal
successivity
hence
if
nothing
had
been
created
there
would
have
remained
infinite
real
duration
without
succession
simply
because
the
virtuality
of
eternity
would
have
remained
in
all
its
perfection
it
is
therefore
this
virtuality
that
formally
constitutes
standing
duration
from
this
the
reader
will
easily
understand
that
in
the
concept
of
standing
duration
two
notions
are
involved
viz
that
of
as
expressing
the
standing
and
that
of
its
as
connoting
virtual
extent
in
fact
eternity
absolutely
considered
is
simply
the
actuality
of
substance
and
as
such
does
not
connote
duration
for
substance
is
not
said
but
simply
the
formal
reason
of
duration
is
derived
from
the
extrinsic
terminability
of
eternity
for
the
word
conveys
the
idea
of
continuation
and
continuation
implies
succession
hence
it
is
on
account
of
its
extrinsic
terminability
to
successive
terms
of
duration
that
eternity
is
conceived
as
equivalent
to
infinite
succession
for
what
virtually
contains
in
itself
all
possible
terms
and
intervals
of
succession
virtually
contains
in
itself
all
succession
and
can
co
exist
without
intrinsic
change
with
all
the
changes
of
contingent
duration
balmes
after
defining
succession
as
the
existence
of
such
things
as
exclude
one
another
very
properly
remarks
there
were
a
being
which
neither
excluded
any
other
being
nor
were
excluded
by
any
of
them
that
being
would
with
all
beings
now
one
such
being
exists
viz
god
and
god
alone
hence
theologians
do
but
express
a
great
and
profound
truth
when
they
say
though
not
all
perhaps
fully
understand
what
they
say
that
god
is
present
to
all
times
that
to
him
there
is
no
succession
no
or
that
to
him
everything
is
present
is
we
conclude
that
standing
duration
is
infinite
independent
of
all
contingent
things
indivisible
immovable
formally
simple
and
unextended
but
equivalent
to
infinite
intervals
of
successive
duration
and
virtually
extending
through
infinite
lengths
this
duration
is
absolute
the
creation
of
a
contingent
being
in
absolute
duration
cause
any
intrinsic
change
in
standing
duration
the
answer
is
not
doubtful
for
we
have
already
seen
that
standing
duration
is
incapable
of
intrinsic
modifications
nevertheless
it
will
not
be
superfluous
to
remark
for
the
better
understanding
of
this
answer
that
the
the
of
a
contingent
being
has
the
same
relation
to
the
virtuality
of
eternity
as
has
its
the
to
the
virtuality
of
immensity
for
as
the
of
every
possible
creature
is
virtually
precontained
in
absolute
space
so
is
the
of
all
creatures
virtually
precontained
in
absolute
duration
hence
the
creation
of
any
number
of
contingent
beings
in
duration
implies
nothing
but
the
termination
of
absolute
duration
which
accordingly
remains
altogether
unaffected
by
the
existence
in
it
of
any
number
of
extrinsic
terms
the
of
a
contingent
being
as
contained
in
absolute
duration
is
virtual
it
does
not
become
formal
except
in
the
contingent
being
itself
that
is
by
extrinsic
termination
thus
the
subject
of
the
contingent
is
not
the
virtuality
of
eternity
any
more
than
the
subject
of
the
contingent
is
the
virtuality
of
immensity
this
shows
that
the
formal
of
a
contingent
being
is
a
mere
relativity
or
a
the
formal
reason
or
the
foundation
of
this
relativity
is
the
reality
through
which
the
contingent
being
communicates
with
absolute
standing
duration
viz
the
real
instant
which
is
common
to
both
although
not
in
the
same
manner
for
it
is
in
standing
duration
whilst
it
is
in
the
extrinsic
term
hence
a
contingent
being
inasmuch
as
it
has
existence
in
standing
duration
is
nothing
but
a
term
related
by
its
to
divine
eternity
as
existing
in
a
more
perfect
manner
in
the
same
but
since
the
contingent
of
the
creature
exclusively
belongs
to
the
creature
itself
standing
duration
receives
nothing
from
it
except
a
relative
extrinsic
denomination
the
relation
resulting
from
the
existence
of
a
created
term
in
standing
duration
consists
in
this
that
the
created
term
by
its
formal
really
imitates
the
eminent
mode
of
being
of
god
himself
in
the
same
this
relation
is
called
simultaneousness
is
often
confounded
with
presence
and
with
but
these
three
notions
rigorously
speaking
differ
from
one
another
refers
to
terms
in
space
to
terms
in
duration
to
terms
both
present
and
simultaneous
thus
presence
and
simultaneousness
are
the
constituents
of
presence
is
to
be
considered
as
the
material
constituent
because
it
depends
on
the
which
belongs
to
the
thing
on
account
of
its
matter
or
potency
simultaneousness
must
be
considered
as
the
formal
constituent
because
it
depends
on
the
which
belongs
to
the
thing
on
account
of
its
act
or
of
its
resulting
actuality
before
we
proceed
further
we
must
yet
remark
that
in
the
same
manner
as
the
infinite
virtuality
of
divine
immensity
receives
distinct
extrinsic
denominations
from
the
contingent
terms
existing
in
space
and
is
thus
said
to
imply
so
also
the
infinite
virtuality
of
eternity
can
be
said
to
imply
distinct
virtualities
owing
to
the
distinct
denominations
it
receives
from
distinct
terms
of
contingent
duration
it
is
for
this
reason
that
we
can
speak
of
virtualities
of
eternity
in
the
plural
thus
when
we
point
out
the
first
instant
of
any
movement
as
distinct
from
any
following
instant
we
consider
the
flowing
of
the
contingent
from
to
as
a
passage
from
one
to
another
virtuality
of
standing
duration
these
virtualities
however
are
not
distinct
as
to
their
absolute
beings
but
only
as
to
their
extrinsic
termination
and
denomination
and
therefore
they
are
really
but
one
infinite
virtuality
as
all
that
we
have
said
of
the
virtualities
of
absolute
space
in
one
of
our
past
articles
equally
applies
to
the
virtualities
of
absolute
duration
we
need
not
dwell
here
any
longer
on
this
point
what
does
the
of
a
contingent
being
precisely
consist
from
the
preceding
considerations
it
is
evident
that
the
of
a
contingent
being
may
be
understood
in
two
manners
either
or
objectively
considered
the
is
nothing
else
than
simple
and
indivisible
term
in
formally
marked
out
in
it
by
the
actuality
of
the
contingent
being
we
say
simple
and
indivisible
because
the
actuality
of
the
contingent
being
by
which
it
is
determined
involves
neither
past
nor
future
neither
nor
but
only
its
present
existence
which
as
such
is
confined
to
an
indivisible
hence
we
do
not
agree
with
those
philosophers
who
confound
the
with
the
that
is
the
with
the
extent
of
flowing
duration
we
admit
with
these
philosophers
that
the
of
contingent
things
extends
through
movement
from
to
and
draws
so
to
say
a
continuous
line
in
duration
but
we
must
remind
them
that
the
and
the
are
distinct
modes
of
being
in
duration
and
that
every
term
of
duration
designable
between
them
is
a
distinct
independent
of
every
other
either
preceding
or
following
which
shows
that
the
implies
an
uninterrupted
series
of
distinct
and
therefore
can
not
be
considered
as
synonymous
with
if
the
is
considered
subjectively
that
is
as
an
appurtenance
of
the
subject
of
which
it
is
predicated
it
may
be
defined
as
mode
of
being
of
a
contingent
thing
in
this
mode
consists
of
a
mere
relativity
for
it
results
from
the
extrinsic
termination
of
absolute
duration
as
already
explained
hence
the
is
not
in
the
subject
of
which
it
is
predicated
and
does
not
in
it
but
like
all
other
relativities
and
connotations
simply
connects
it
with
its
correlative
and
intervenes
or
lies
between
the
one
and
the
other
but
although
it
consists
of
a
mere
relativity
the
still
admits
of
being
divided
into
and
according
as
it
is
conceived
absolutely
as
something
real
in
nature
or
compared
with
some
other
for
as
we
have
already
explained
when
treating
of
ubications
relative
entities
may
be
considered
both
as
to
what
they
are
in
themselves
and
as
to
what
they
are
to
one
another
if
the
is
considered
simply
as
a
termination
of
standing
duration
without
regard
for
anything
else
it
is
called
and
is
defined
as
mode
of
being
of
a
thing
in
absolute
this
absolute
is
an
of
the
contingent
being
no
less
than
its
dependence
from
the
first
cause
and
is
altogether
immutable
so
long
as
the
contingent
being
exists
for
on
the
one
hand
the
contingent
being
can
not
exist
but
within
the
domain
of
divine
eternity
and
on
the
other
it
can
not
have
different
modes
of
being
with
regard
to
it
as
the
standing
duration
of
eternity
is
all
uniform
in
its
infinite
virtual
extension
and
the
contingent
being
however
much
we
may
try
to
vary
its
place
in
duration
must
always
be
in
the
very
middle
of
eternity
hence
the
absolute
is
altogether
unchangeable
if
the
of
a
contingent
being
is
compared
with
that
of
another
contingent
being
in
order
to
ascertain
their
mutual
relation
then
the
is
called
and
as
such
it
may
be
defined
as
mode
of
terminating
a
relation
in
this
is
changeable
not
in
its
intrinsic
entity
but
in
its
relative
formality
and
it
is
only
under
this
formality
that
the
can
be
ranked
among
the
predicamental
accidents
for
this
changeable
formality
is
the
only
thing
in
it
which
bears
the
stamp
of
an
accidental
entity
the
and
the
of
the
same
contingent
being
are
considered
as
two
distinct
relative
terms
because
the
being
to
which
they
refer
when
existing
in
the
excludes
the
though
the
absolute
of
one
and
the
same
being
is
one
term
only
but
of
this
we
shall
treat
more
fully
in
the
sequel
is
relative
duration
here
we
meet
again
the
same
difficulty
which
we
have
encountered
in
explaining
relative
space
for
in
the
same
manner
as
relations
in
space
are
usually
confounded
with
space
itself
so
are
the
intervals
in
duration
confounded
with
the
duration
which
is
the
ground
of
their
extension
but
as
the
reasonings
by
which
we
have
established
the
precise
notion
of
relative
space
can
be
easily
brought
to
bear
on
the
present
subject
by
the
reader
himself
we
think
we
must
confine
ourselves
to
a
brief
and
clear
statement
of
the
conclusions
drawn
from
those
reasonings
as
applied
to
duration
relative
duration
is
duration
through
which
any
movement
that
is
the
duration
through
which
the
of
anything
in
movement
glides
from
to
and
by
which
the
and
the
are
linked
in
mutual
relation
now
the
duration
through
which
movement
extends
is
not
exactly
the
duration
of
the
movement
itself
but
the
ground
upon
which
the
movement
extends
its
own
duration
because
movement
has
nothing
actual
but
a
flowing
instant
and
therefore
it
has
no
duration
within
itself
except
by
reference
to
an
extrinsic
ground
through
which
it
successively
extends
this
ground
as
we
have
already
shown
is
standing
duration
and
therefore
relative
duration
is
nothing
else
than
duration
as
extrinsically
terminated
by
distinct
or
what
amounts
to
the
same
terminated
by
one
term
which
owing
to
any
kind
of
movement
acquires
distinct
and
opposite
formalities
this
conclusion
is
based
on
the
principle
that
the
foundation
of
all
relations
between
and
must
be
something
absolute
having
in
itself
neither
nor
and
therefore
absolutely
standing
this
principle
is
obviously
true
the
popular
notion
on
the
contrary
that
relative
duration
is
the
duration
of
movement
is
based
on
the
assumption
that
movement
itself
engenders
duration
which
assumption
is
false
for
we
can
not
even
conceive
movement
without
presupposing
the
absolute
duration
upon
which
the
movement
has
to
trace
the
line
of
its
flowing
existence
thus
relative
duration
is
called
relative
not
because
it
is
itself
related
but
because
it
is
the
ground
through
which
the
extrinsic
terms
are
related
it
is
actively
not
passively
relative
it
is
the
not
the
the
foundation
not
the
result
of
the
relativities
in
other
terms
relative
duration
is
absolute
as
to
its
entity
and
relative
as
to
the
extrinsic
denomination
derived
from
the
relations
of
which
it
is
the
formal
reason
duration
as
absolute
may
be
styled
region
of
all
possible
just
as
absolute
space
is
styled
region
of
all
possible
and
as
relative
it
may
be
styled
region
of
all
possible
succession
just
as
relative
space
is
styled
region
of
all
local
absolute
standing
duration
and
absolute
space
are
the
ground
of
the
and
as
statical
terms
relative
standing
duration
and
relative
space
are
the
ground
of
the
and
as
gliding
that
is
as
dynamically
considered
is
an
interval
of
duration
it
is
a
relation
existing
between
two
opposite
terms
of
succession
that
is
between
and
an
interval
of
duration
is
commonly
considered
as
a
continuous
extension
yet
it
is
primarily
a
simple
relation
by
which
the
extension
of
the
flowing
from
to
is
formally
determined
nevertheless
since
the
can
not
acquire
the
opposite
formalities
and
without
continuous
movement
all
interval
of
duration
implies
movement
and
therefore
may
be
considered
also
as
a
continuous
quantity
under
this
last
aspect
the
interval
of
duration
is
nothing
else
than
the
duration
of
the
movement
from
to
we
have
already
noticed
that
the
duration
of
movement
or
the
interval
of
duration
is
not
to
be
confounded
with
the
duration
through
which
the
movement
extends
but
as
in
the
popular
language
the
one
as
well
as
the
other
is
termed
duration
we
would
suggest
that
the
duration
through
which
the
movement
extends
might
be
called
relative
duration
whilst
the
relation
which
constitutes
an
interval
between
and
might
be
called
relative
duration
the
philosophical
necessity
of
this
distinction
is
obvious
first
because
the
duration
through
which
movement
extends
must
not
be
confounded
with
the
duration
of
movement
secondly
because
the
relation
and
its
foundation
are
not
the
same
thing
and
as
we
have
explained
at
length
when
treating
of
relative
space
to
confound
the
one
with
the
other
leads
to
pantheism
intervals
of
relation
are
not
of
absolute
duration
though
they
are
so
conceived
by
many
but
they
are
mere
relations
as
we
have
stated
absolute
duration
is
all
standing
it
has
no
parts
and
it
can
not
be
divided
into
parts
what
is
called
an
interval
duration
should
rather
be
called
an
interval
duration
for
it
is
not
a
portion
of
standing
duration
but
an
extrinsic
result
it
is
not
a
length
of
absolute
duration
but
the
length
of
the
movement
extending
through
that
duration
it
is
not
a
divisible
extension
but
the
ground
on
which
movement
acquires
its
divisible
extension
from
to
in
the
smallest
conceivable
interval
of
duration
there
is
god
with
all
his
eternity
to
affirm
that
intervals
of
duration
are
distinct
durations
would
be
to
cut
eternity
to
pieces
by
giving
it
a
distinct
being
in
really
distinct
intervals
hence
it
is
necessary
to
concede
that
whilst
the
intervals
are
distinct
the
duration
on
which
they
have
their
foundation
is
one
and
the
same
the
only
duration
which
can
be
safely
confounded
with
those
intervals
is
the
flowing
duration
of
the
movement
by
which
they
are
measured
this
is
the
duration
which
can
be
considered
as
a
continuous
quantity
divisible
into
parts
and
this
is
the
duration
which
we
should
style
relative
duration
to
avoid
all
danger
of
error
or
equivocation
the
objections
which
can
be
made
against
this
manner
of
viewing
things
do
not
much
differ
from
those
which
we
have
solved
in
our
second
article
on
space
and
therefore
we
do
not
think
it
necessary
to
make
a
new
answer
to
them
the
reader
himself
will
be
able
to
see
what
the
objections
are
and
how
they
can
be
solved
by
simply
substituting
the
words
for
the
words
in
the
article
referred
to
yet
a
special
objection
can
be
made
against
the
preceding
doctrine
about
the
duration
of
movement
independently
of
those
which
regard
relations
in
space
it
may
be
presented
under
this
form
foundation
of
the
relation
between
and
is
nothing
else
than
movement
itself
it
is
therefore
unnecessary
and
unphilosophical
to
trace
the
duration
of
movement
to
the
virtuality
of
eternity
as
its
extrinsic
the
antecedent
of
this
argument
may
be
proved
thus
thing
is
the
foundation
of
the
relation
which
gives
to
its
terms
their
relative
being
that
is
in
our
case
their
opposite
formalities
and
but
movement
alone
gives
to
the
these
opposite
formalities
therefore
movement
alone
is
the
foundation
of
successive
we
answer
that
the
antecedent
of
the
first
argument
is
absolutely
false
as
to
the
syllogism
which
comes
next
we
concede
the
major
but
we
deny
the
minor
for
it
is
plain
that
movement
can
not
give
to
the
absolute
the
relative
formalities
and
except
by
flowing
through
absolute
duration
without
which
it
is
impossible
for
the
movement
to
have
its
successive
duration
and
surely
if
the
movement
has
no
duration
but
that
which
it
borrows
from
the
absolute
duration
through
which
it
extends
the
foundation
of
its
duration
from
to
can
be
nothing
else
than
the
same
absolute
duration
through
which
the
movement
acquires
its
and
now
this
absolute
duration
is
the
virtuality
of
eternity
as
we
have
proved
it
is
therefore
both
philosophical
and
necessary
to
trace
the
duration
of
movement
to
the
virtuality
of
eternity
as
its
extrinsic
foundation
that
movement
is
also
necessary
to
constitute
the
relation
between
and
we
fully
admit
for
there
can
not
be
and
without
movement
but
it
does
not
follow
from
this
that
movement
is
the
of
the
relation
it
merely
follows
that
movement
is
a
necessary
to
give
to
the
absolute
two
distinct
actualities
according
to
which
it
may
be
compared
with
itself
on
the
ground
of
standing
duration
for
as
every
relation
demands
two
opposite
terms
the
same
absolute
must
acquire
two
opposite
formalities
that
it
may
be
related
to
itself
the
only
other
objection
which
may
perhaps
be
made
against
our
conclusions
is
the
following
the
foundation
of
a
real
relation
is
that
reality
through
which
the
terms
related
communicate
with
one
another
now
evidently
the
and
the
which
are
the
terms
of
the
relation
in
question
communicate
with
one
another
through
the
same
absolute
for
they
are
the
same
absolute
under
two
opposite
formalities
hence
it
follows
that
the
foundation
of
the
relation
between
and
is
nothing
else
than
the
absolute
of
a
moving
being
to
this
we
answer
that
the
foundation
of
the
relation
is
not
all
reality
through
which
the
terms
related
communicate
with
one
another
but
only
that
reality
by
the
common
termination
of
which
they
become
formally
related
to
one
another
hence
since
the
and
the
do
not
receive
their
relative
formalities
from
the
absolute
it
is
idle
to
pretend
that
the
absolute
is
the
foundation
of
the
interval
of
duration
the
and
the
communicate
with
the
same
absolute
not
as
a
formal
but
as
a
material
cause
of
their
existence
that
is
inasmuch
as
the
same
is
the
subject
not
the
reason
of
both
formalities
the
only
relation
to
which
the
absolute
can
give
a
foundation
is
one
of
identity
with
itself
in
all
the
extent
of
its
flowing
duration
but
such
a
relation
presupposes
instead
of
constituting
an
interval
in
duration
and
therefore
it
is
manifest
that
the
absolute
is
not
the
foundation
of
the
relation
between
and
having
thus
answered
the
questions
proposed
and
given
the
solution
of
the
few
difficulties
objected
we
must
now
say
a
few
words
about
the
and
of
relative
duration
whether
fundamental
or
resultant
fundamental
or
standing
duration
is
divided
into
and
this
division
can
not
regard
the
entity
of
standing
duration
which
is
unquestionably
real
as
we
have
proved
it
regards
the
reality
or
the
unreality
of
the
extrinsic
terms
conceived
as
having
a
relation
in
duration
the
true
notion
of
real
contrasted
with
imaginary
duration
is
the
following
standing
duration
is
called
when
it
is
relative
when
it
is
extrinsically
terminated
by
real
terms
between
which
it
founds
a
real
relation
on
the
contrary
it
is
called
when
the
extrinsic
terms
do
not
exist
in
nature
but
only
in
our
imagination
for
in
such
a
case
standing
duration
is
not
really
terminated
and
does
not
found
real
relations
but
both
the
terminations
and
the
relations
are
simply
a
figment
of
our
imagination
thus
standing
duration
as
containing
none
but
imaginary
relations
may
justly
be
called
though
in
an
absolute
sense
it
is
intrinsically
real
accordingly
the
duration
which
we
imagine
when
we
carry
our
thought
beyond
the
creation
of
the
world
and
which
is
also
called
is
not
absolute
but
relative
duration
and
is
not
imaginary
in
itself
but
only
as
to
its
denomination
of
relative
because
in
the
absence
of
all
real
terms
there
can
be
none
but
imaginary
relations
it
is
therefore
unphilosophical
to
confound
imaginary
and
indefinite
duration
with
absolute
and
infinite
duration
this
latter
is
not
an
object
of
imagination
but
of
the
intellect
alone
imagination
can
not
conceive
duration
except
in
connection
with
some
movement
from
to
hence
absolute
and
infinite
duration
which
has
no
and
no
is
altogether
beyond
the
reach
of
imagination
indeed
our
intellectual
conception
of
infinite
standing
duration
is
always
accompanied
in
our
minds
by
a
representation
of
indefinite
time
but
this
depends
as
we
have
stated
in
speaking
of
space
on
the
connection
of
our
imaginative
and
intellectual
operations
inasmuch
as
our
imagination
strives
to
follow
the
intellect
and
to
represent
after
its
own
manner
what
the
intellect
conceives
in
a
totally
different
manner
it
was
by
confounding
the
objective
notion
of
duration
with
our
subjective
manner
of
imagining
it
that
kant
came
to
the
conclusion
that
duration
was
nothing
but
a
subjective
form
or
a
subjective
condition
under
which
all
intuitions
are
possible
in
us
this
conclusion
is
evidently
false
but
its
refutation
to
be
successful
must
be
based
on
the
objectivity
of
absolute
standing
duration
without
which
as
we
have
shown
there
can
be
no
field
for
real
and
objective
succession
resultant
relative
duration
that
is
an
interval
of
flowing
duration
admits
of
the
same
division
into
and
it
is
real
when
a
real
continuous
flowing
connects
the
with
the
in
all
other
suppositions
it
will
be
imaginary
it
may
be
remarked
that
the
continuous
may
be
either
intrinsic
or
extrinsic
thus
if
god
had
created
nothing
but
a
simple
angel
there
would
have
been
no
other
flowing
duration
than
a
continuous
succession
of
intellectual
operations
connecting
the
with
the
in
the
angel
himself
and
thus
his
duration
would
have
been
measured
by
a
series
of
intrinsic
changes
it
is
evident
that
in
this
case
one
absolute
suffices
to
extend
the
interval
of
duration
for
by
its
gliding
from
to
it
acquires
opposite
formalities
through
which
it
can
be
relatively
opposed
to
itself
as
the
subject
and
the
term
of
the
relation
if
on
the
contrary
we
consider
the
interval
of
duration
between
two
distinct
beings
say
cæsar
and
napoleon
then
the
real
continuous
flowing
by
which
such
an
interval
is
measured
is
extrinsic
to
the
terms
compared
for
the
of
cæsar
is
distinct
from
and
does
not
reach
that
of
napoleon
which
shows
that
their
respective
have
no
intrinsic
connection
and
that
the
succession
comprised
between
those
must
have
consisted
of
a
series
of
changes
extrinsic
to
the
terms
compared
it
may
seem
difficult
to
conceive
how
an
interval
of
continuous
succession
can
result
between
two
terms
of
which
the
one
does
not
attain
to
the
other
for
as
a
line
in
space
must
be
drawn
by
the
movement
of
a
single
point
so
it
seems
that
a
length
in
duration
must
be
extended
by
the
flowing
of
a
single
from
to
the
truth
is
that
the
interval
between
the
of
two
distinct
beings
is
not
obtained
by
comparing
the
of
the
one
with
that
of
the
other
but
by
resorting
to
the
of
some
other
being
which
has
extended
its
continuous
succession
from
the
one
to
the
other
thus
when
cæsar
died
the
earth
was
revolving
on
its
axis
and
it
continued
to
revolve
without
interruption
up
to
the
existence
of
napoleon
thus
extending
the
duration
of
its
movement
from
a
corresponding
to
death
to
a
corresponding
to
birth
and
this
duration
wholly
extrinsic
to
cæsar
and
napoleon
measures
the
interval
between
them
as
all
intervals
of
duration
extend
from
to
there
can
be
no
interval
between
beings
as
is
evident
in
the
same
manner
as
two
beings
whose
ubications
coincide
can
not
be
distant
in
space
so
two
beings
whose
are
simultaneous
can
not
form
an
interval
of
duration
all
real
intervals
of
duration
regard
the
past
for
in
the
past
alone
can
we
find
a
real
and
a
real
the
present
gives
no
interval
as
we
have
just
stated
but
only
simultaneousness
the
future
is
real
only
potentially
that
is
it
will
be
real
but
it
is
not
yet
what
has
never
been
and
never
will
be
is
merely
imaginary
to
this
last
class
belong
all
the
intervals
of
duration
corresponding
to
those
conditional
events
which
did
not
happen
owing
to
the
of
the
conditions
on
which
their
reality
depended
as
to
the
measurement
of
flowing
duration
a
few
words
will
suffice
the
considered
absolutely
is
incapable
of
measuring
an
interval
of
duration
for
the
reason
that
the
is
unextended
and
therefore
unproportionate
to
the
mensuration
of
a
continuous
interval
for
the
measure
must
be
of
the
same
kind
with
the
thing
to
be
measured
just
as
a
continuous
line
can
not
be
made
up
of
unextended
points
so
can
not
a
continuous
interval
be
made
up
of
indivisible
instants
hence
as
a
line
is
divisible
only
into
smaller
and
smaller
lines
by
which
it
can
be
measured
so
also
an
interval
of
duration
is
divisible
only
into
smaller
and
smaller
intervals
and
is
measured
by
the
same
these
smaller
intervals
being
continuous
are
themselves
divisible
and
mensurable
by
other
intervals
of
less
duration
and
these
other
intervals
are
again
divisible
and
mensurable
so
that
from
the
nature
of
the
thing
it
is
impossible
to
reach
an
absolute
measure
of
duration
and
we
must
rest
satisfied
with
a
relative
one
just
as
in
the
case
of
a
line
and
of
any
other
continuous
quantity
the
smallest
unit
or
measure
of
duration
commonly
used
is
the
second
or
sixtieth
part
of
a
minute
but
since
continuous
quantities
are
divisible
it
may
be
asked
what
prevents
us
from
considering
a
finite
interval
of
duration
as
containing
an
infinite
multitude
of
infinitesimal
units
of
duration
if
nothing
prevents
us
then
in
the
infinitesimal
unit
we
shall
have
the
true
and
absolute
measure
of
duration
we
answer
that
nothing
prevents
such
a
conception
but
the
mensuration
of
a
finite
interval
by
infinitesimal
units
would
never
supply
us
the
means
of
determining
the
relative
lengths
of
two
intervals
of
duration
for
if
every
interval
is
a
sum
of
infinite
terms
and
is
so
represented
how
can
we
decide
which
of
those
intervals
is
the
greater
since
we
can
not
count
the
infinite
mathematicians
in
all
dynamical
questions
express
the
conditions
of
the
movement
in
terms
of
infinitesimal
quantities
and
consider
every
actual
instant
which
connects
the
with
the
as
an
infinitesimal
interval
of
duration
in
the
same
manner
as
they
consider
every
shifting
ubication
as
an
infinitesimal
interval
of
space
but
when
they
pass
from
infinitesimal
to
finite
quantities
by
integration
between
determinate
limits
they
do
not
express
the
finite
intervals
in
infinitesimal
terms
but
in
terms
of
a
finite
unit
a
second
of
time
and
this
shows
that
even
in
high
mathematics
the
infinitesimal
is
not
taken
as
the
measure
of
the
finite
since
infinitesimals
are
considered
as
evanescent
quantities
the
question
may
be
asked
whether
they
are
still
conceivable
as
quantities
we
have
no
intention
of
discussing
here
the
philosophical
grounds
of
infinitesimal
calculus
as
we
may
have
hereafter
a
better
opportunity
of
examining
such
an
interesting
subject
but
so
far
as
infinitesimals
of
duration
are
concerned
we
answer
that
they
are
still
quantities
though
they
bear
no
comparison
with
finite
duration
what
mathematicians
call
an
infinitesimal
of
time
is
nothing
else
rigorously
than
the
flowing
of
an
actual
from
to
the
as
such
is
no
quantity
but
its
flowing
is
however
narrow
the
compass
within
which
it
may
be
reduced
the
flowing
implies
a
relation
between
and
hence
every
instant
of
successive
duration
inasmuch
as
it
actually
links
its
immediate
with
its
immediate
partakes
of
the
nature
of
successive
duration
and
therefore
of
continuous
quantity
nor
does
it
matter
that
infinitesimals
are
called
quantities
they
indeed
vanish
as
compared
with
finite
quantities
but
the
very
fact
of
their
vanishing
proves
that
they
are
still
something
when
they
are
in
the
act
of
vanishing
sir
isaac
newton
after
saying
in
his
that
he
intends
to
reduce
the
demonstration
of
a
series
of
propositions
to
the
first
and
last
sums
and
ratios
of
nascent
and
evanescent
quantities
propounds
and
solves
this
very
difficulty
as
follows
it
may
be
objected
that
there
is
no
ultimate
proportion
of
evanescent
quantities
because
the
proportion
before
the
quantities
have
vanished
is
not
the
ultimate
and
when
they
are
vanished
is
none
but
by
the
same
argument
it
may
be
alleged
that
a
body
arriving
at
a
certain
place
and
there
stopping
has
no
ultimate
velocity
because
the
velocity
before
the
body
comes
to
the
place
is
not
its
ultimate
velocity
when
it
has
arrived
is
none
but
the
answer
is
easy
for
by
the
ultimate
velocity
is
meant
that
with
which
the
body
is
moved
neither
it
arrives
at
its
last
place
and
the
motion
ceases
nor
but
at
the
it
arrives
that
is
the
velocity
with
which
the
body
arrives
at
its
last
place
and
with
which
the
motion
ceases
and
in
like
manner
by
the
ultimate
ratio
of
evanescent
quantities
is
to
be
understood
the
ratio
of
the
quantities
not
before
they
vanish
not
afterwards
but
with
which
they
vanish
in
like
manner
the
first
ratio
of
nascent
quantities
is
that
with
which
they
begin
to
from
this
answer
which
is
so
clear
and
so
deep
it
is
manifest
that
infinitesimals
are
real
quantities
whence
we
infer
that
every
instant
of
duration
which
actually
flows
from
to
marks
out
a
real
infinitesimal
interval
of
duration
that
might
serve
as
a
unit
of
measure
for
the
mensuration
of
all
finite
intervals
of
succession
were
it
not
that
we
can
not
reckon
up
to
infinity
nevertheless
it
does
not
follow
that
an
infinitesimal
duration
is
an
absolute
unit
of
duration
for
it
is
still
continuous
even
in
its
infinite
smallness
and
accordingly
it
is
still
divisible
and
mensurable
by
other
units
of
a
lower
standard
thus
it
is
clear
that
the
measurement
of
flowing
duration
and
indeed
of
all
other
continuous
quantity
can
not
be
made
except
by
some
arbitrary
and
conventional
unit

gaze
in

on
the
countless

they
from
my

their

they
into
endless
distance
almost
seem

away

the
of
schwytz
standing
at
that
angle
of
the
lake
of
lucerne
where
it
turns
abruptly
towards
the
very
heart
of
the
alps
has
always
been
a
central
for
travellers
but
since
the
erection
of
its
large
hotel
the
attraction
has
greatly
increased
we
found
the
waldstätterhof
full
to
overflowing
and
rejoiced
that
as
usual
we
had
wisely
ordered
our
rooms
beforehand
our
surprise
was
great
as
we
threaded
the
mazes
of
the
room
to
see
herr
h
come
forward
and
greet
us
cordially
we
expected
it
is
true
to
meet
him
here
but
not
until
the
eve
of
the
feast
at
einsiedeln
whither
he
had
promised
to
accompany
us
an
unforeseen
event
however
had
brought
him
up
the
lake
sooner
and
he
therefore
came
on
to
brunnen
in
the
hope
of
finding
us
a
few
minutes
sufficed
to
make
him
quit
his
place
at
the
centre
table
and
join
us
at
a
small
one
where
supper
had
been
prepared
for
our
party
and
allow
us
to
begin
a
description
of
our
wanderings
since
we
parted
from
him
on
the
quay
at
lucerne
yes
is
the
proper
word
for
before
long
the
harmony
was
marred
by
george
who
with
his
usual
impetuosity
and
in
spite
of
warning
frowns
and
and
my
appealing
looks
betrayed
our
disappointment
at
having
missed
the
hermitage
at
ranft
and
the
reproaches
we
had
heaped
on
herr
h
head
for
having
mismanaged
the
programme
in
that
particular
the
cheery
little
man
whose
eyes
had
just
begun
to
glisten
with
delight
grew
troubled
am
sorry
he
exclaimed
the
ladies
were
not
so
enthusiastic
about
blessed
nicholas
when
i
saw
them
and
as
for
you
george
i
never
could
have
dreamt
you
would
have
cared
for
the
but
is
a
real
historical
character
you
see
about
whom
there
can
be
no
doubt
very
unlike
your
your
mythical
hero
william
tell
replied
george
care
take
care
young
gentleman
said
herr
h
laughing
you
are
now
in
territory
and
he
may
make
you
rue
the
consequences
of
deriding
him
imagine
either
that
your
modern
historical
critics
have
left
even
blessed
nicholas
alone
oh
dear
he
is
vouched
for
by
documents
retorted
one
can
doubt
critics
of
this
age
would
turn
and
twist
and
doubt
anything
said
herr
h
can
not
deny
his
existence
nor
the
main
features
of
his
life
yet
some
have
gone
so
far
as
to
pretend
to
doubt
the
most
authentic
fact
in
it
his
presence
at
the
diet
of
stanz
saying
that
he
never
went
there
but
only
wrote
a
letter
to
the
deputies
so
much
for
their
criticism
and
researches
after
that
specimen
you
need
not
wonder
that
i
have
no
respect
for
them
but
i
am
in
an
unusually
patriotic
mood
for
i
have
just
come
from
a
meeting
at
beckenried
on
the
opposite
shore
in
unterwalden
it
was
that
which
brought
me
here
before
my
appointment
with
you
it
was
a
meeting
of
one
of
our
catholic
societies
in
these
cantons
which
assembled
to
protest
against
the
revision
of
the
constitution
contemplated
next
spring
before
separating
it
was
suggested
that
they
should
call
a
larger
one
at
the
rütli
to
evoke
the
memories
of
the
past
and
conform
themselves
to
the
pattern
of
our
do
you
so
much
object
to
a
revision
inquired
c
reform
must
sometimes
be
of
course
but
not
at
present
my
dear
sir
nowadays
simply
means
radicalism
and
the
suppression
of
our
religion
and
our
religious
rights
and
privileges
it
is
a
word
which
for
that
reason
alone
is
at
all
times
distasteful
to
these
cantons
moreover
it
savors
too
much
of
french
ideas
and
doctrines
thoroughly
antagonistic
to
all
our
principles
and
feelings
everything
french
is
loathed
in
these
parts
especially
in
unterwalden
in
spite
of
or
i
should
perhaps
rather
say
in
consequence
of
all
they
suffered
from
that
nation
in
can
understand
that
said
c
the
memory
of
the
massacre
in
the
church
at
stanz
always
in
their
yes
but
that
was
only
one
act
in
the
tragedy
the
desolation
they
caused
in
that
part
of
the
country
was
fearful
above
all
their
total
want
of
religion
at
that
period
can
never
be
for
myself
remarked
c
not
a
catholic
i
confess
that
i
should
much
rather
rely
on
the
upright
instincts
of
this
pious
population
than
on
the
crooked
teachings
of
our
modern
philosophers
i
have
always
noticed
in
every
great
political
crisis
that
the
instincts
of
the
pure
and
have
something
of
an
inspiration
about
them
they
go
straight
to
the
true
principles
where
a
macchiavelli
is
often
at
herr
h
completely
agreed
with
him
and
the
conversation
soon
became
a
deep
and
serious
discussion
on
the
tendencies
of
modern
politics
in
general
so
that
it
was
late
that
evening
before
our
party
separated
the
first
sound
that
fell
upon
my
ear
next
morning
was
the
splashing
of
a
steamer
hard
by
it
had
been
so
dark
upon
our
arrival
the
night
before
that
we
had
not
altogether
realized
the
close
proximity
of
the
hotel
to
the
lake
and
it
was
an
unexpected
pleasure
to
find
my
balcony
almost
directly
over
the
water
like
the
stern
gallery
of
a
ship
of
war
a
small
steamer
certainly
was
approaching
from
the
upper
end
of
the
lake
with
a
old
diligence
in
the
bows
and
a
few
travellers
and
scattered
on
the
deck
very
unlike
the
brilliant
throngs
that
pass
to
and
fro
during
the
late
hours
of
the
day
but
this
early
morning
performance
was
one
of
real
business
and
the
magical
words
and
gothard
which
stood
out
in
large
letters
on
the
yellow
panels
of
the
diligence
told
at
once
of
more
than
mere
what
joy
or
grief
happiness
or
despair
might
not
this
vehicle
be
at
this
moment
conveying
to
unknown
thousands
it
was
an
abrupt
transition
too
to
be
thus
brought
from
pastoral
sarnen
and
sachslen
into
immediate
contact
with
the
mighty
alps
of
their
grandeur
however
nothing
could
be
seen
for
without
rain
or
wind
a
thick
cloud
lay
low
upon
the
lake
more
like
a
large
flat
ceiling
than
aught
else
yet
for
us
it
had
its
own
peculiar
interest
being
nothing
more
nor
less
than
the
great
heavy
soft
mass
which
we
had
noticed
hanging
over
the
lake
every
morning
when
looking
down
from
kaltbad
whilst
we
revelling
in
sunshine
and
brightness
above
were
pitying
the
poor
inhabitants
along
the
shore
beneath
there
was
a
kind
of
superiority
therefore
in
knowing
what
it
meant
and
in
feeling
confident
that
it
would
not
last
long
and
as
we
expected
it
did
clear
away
whilst
we
sat
at
our
little
in
the
window
revealing
in
all
its
magnificence
the
glorious
view
from
this
point
up
the
bay
of
uri
which
we
have
elsewhere
described
huge
mountains
seemed
to
rise
vertically
up
out
of
the
green
waters
verdant
patches
were
dotted
here
and
there
on
their
rugged
sides
and
overtopping
all
shone
the
glacier
of
the
urirothstock
more
dazzlingly
white
and
transparent
than
we
had
ever
yet
beheld
it
ladies
exclaimed
herr
h
hope
you
have
your
schiller
ready
for
the
rütli
is
yonder
though
you
will
see
it
better
by
and
i
thought
you
disapproved
of
schiller
retorted
the
irrepressibly
argumentative
george
a
certain
degree
no
doubt
replied
herr
h
nothing
can
be
finer
than
his
as
a
whole
my
quarrel
with
it
is
that
the
real
william
tell
would
have
fared
much
better
were
it
not
for
this
play
and
especially
for
the
opera
they
have
both
made
the
subject
so
common
so
as
the
french
say
that
the
world
has
grown
tired
of
it
and
for
this
reason
alone
is
predisposed
to
reject
our
hero
besides
the
real
history
of
the
revolution
is
so
fine
that
i
prefer
it
in
its
simplicity
schiller
is
certainly
true
to
its
spirit
but
details
are
frequently
different
for
instance
the
taking
of
the
castle
of
the
rossberg
which
you
passed
on
the
lake
of
alpnach
schiller
has
converted
that
into
a
most
sensational
scene
whereas
the
true
story
is
far
more
characteristic
that
was
the
place
where
a
young
girl
admitted
her
betrothed
and
his
twelve
confederate
friends
by
a
at
night
which
enabled
them
to
seize
the
castle
and
imprison
the
garrison
shedding
a
drop
of
blood
or
injuring
the
property
of
the
habsburgs
in
exact
conformity
with
their
oath
on
the
rütli
you
will
often
read
of
the
loves
of
jägeli
and
ameli
in
swiss
poetry
they
are
great
favorites
and
in
my
opinion
far
more
beautiful
than
the
fictitious
romance
of
rudenz
and
bertha
and
so
in
many
other
cases
but
every
one
does
not
object
to
schiller
as
i
do
for
in
when
his
centenary
was
celebrated
in
germany
the
swiss
held
a
festival
here
on
the
rütli
and
subsequently
erected
a
tablet
on
that
large
natural
pyramidal
rock
you
see
at
the
corner
opposite
it
is
called
the
wytenstein
and
you
can
read
the
large
gilt
words
with
a
glass
it
is
laconic
enough
too

singer

let
me
congratulate
you
on
being

the
cradle

continued
herr
h
as
we
sauntered
out
on
the
quay
pointing
at
the
same
time
to
some
bad
frescos
of
swen
and
suiter
on
a
warehouse
close
by
stauffacher
fürst
and
van

halden
also
figured
on
the
walls
the
presiding
geniuses
of
this
region
is
in
no
way
to
be
despised
i
assure
you
ladies
you
are
treading
on
venerated
soil
this
is
the
very
spot
that
witnessed
the
foundation
of
the
confederacy
where
the
oath
was
taken
by
the
representatives
of
uri
schwytz
and
unterwalden
the
day
after
the
battle
of
morgarten
they
swore
die
each
for
all
and
all
for
the
oath
which
made
switzerland
renowned
and
gave
the
name
of
or
to
its
inhabitants
the
document
is
still
kept
in
the
archives
at
schwytz
with
another
dated
august
aloys
von
reding

his
standard
against
the
french
here
in
and
he
was
quite
right
in
beginning
his
resistance
to
them
at
brunnen
it
is
full
of
memories
to
us
swiss
and
is
a
most
central
point
as
you
may
see
between
all
these
cantons
the
increase
in
the
hotels
tells
what
a
favorite
region
it
also
is
with
on
this
point
and
c
astonishment
was
unbounded
they
had
passed
a
fortnight
at
brunnen
in
at
a
small
inn
with
scanty
accommodation
now
replaced
by
the
large
and
comfortable
waldstätterhof
situated
in
one
of
the
most
lovely
spots
imaginable
at
the
angle
of
the
lake
one
side
fronting
the
bay
of
uri
and
the
other
looking
up
towards
mount
pilatus
the
of
seelisberg
existed
on
the
heights
opposite
even
then
only
however
as
a
small
house
instead
of
the
present
extensive
establishment
with
its
pretty
woods
and
walks
but
axenstein
and
the
second
large
hotel
now
building
near
it
with
the
splendid
road
leading
up
to
them
had
not
been
thought
of
the
only
communication
by
land
between
schwytz
and
fluelen
in
those
days
was
a
along
the
hills
precipitous
and
dangerous
in
many
parts
the
now
famed
axenstrasse
was
not
undertaken
until
and
is
said
to
have
been
suggested
by
the
french
war
in
italy
with
the
old
swiss
dread
of
the
french
still
at
heart
the
federal
government
took
alarm
at
that
first
military
undertaking
on
the
part
of
napoleon
and
seeing
the
evil
of
having
no
communication
between
these
cantons
in
case
of
attack
at
once
took
the
matter
seriously
in
hand
this
great
engineering
achievement
was
opened
to
the
public
in
it
looked
most
inviting
and
we
quickly
decided
to
make
use
of
it
by
driving
along
it
to
fluelen
and
thence
to
altorf
returning
in
the
evening
by
the
steamer
some
were
anxious
to
visit
the
rütli
but
and
c
had
been
there
before
and
knew
that
it
was
more
than
an
expedition
by
boat
so
that
the
two
excursions
on
the
same
day
would
be
quite
impossible
consequently
we
chose
the
longer
one
it
was
just
ten
when
we
started
c
caroline
herr
h
and
myself
in
one
carriage
with
george
on
the
box
the
others
following
us
in
a
second
vehicle
we
had
not
proceeded
far
when
herr
h
made
us
halt
to
look
at
the
rütli
on
the
shore
right
opposite
we
distinctly
saw
that
it
was
a
small
meadow
formed
by
earth
fallen
from
above
on
a
ledge
of
rock
under
the
precipitous
heights
of
seelisberg
and
now
enclosed
by
some
fine
chestnut
and
walnut
trees
truly
it
was
a
spot
fitted
for
the
famous
scene
so
unapproachable
is
it
except
by
water
that
even
that
most
enterprising
race
swiss
have
hitherto
failed
to
destroy
it
some
years
ago
however
it
narrowly
escaped
this
fate
for
herr
müller
of
seelisberg
is
said
to
have
been
on
the
point
of
building
a
on
the
great
meadow
but
no
sooner
did
this
become
known
than
a
national
subscription
was
at
once
raised
the
government
purchased
it
and
now
it
has
become
inalienable
national
property
for
ever
may
well
be
proud
of
your
country
herr
h
exclaimed
c
from
the
other
carriage
always
look
on
that
tiny
spot
with
deep
reverence
as
the
true
cradle
of
freedom
look
at
it
well
george
it
witnessed
that
wonderful
oath
by
which
these
mountaineers
bound
themselves
be
faithful
to
each
other
just
and
merciful
to
their
the
only
known
example
of
men
and
these
men
peasants
too
binding
themselves
in
the
excitement
of
revolt
not
to
take
revenge
on
their
sublime
ejaculated
george
it
has
borne
good
fruit
returned
herr
h
in
gleeful
tones
here
we
are
still
free
except
on
the
one
occasion
of
the
french
in
no
foreign
troops
have
ever
invaded
this
part
of
switzerland
since
those
days
yes
there
are
three
springs
at
the
rütli
supposed
to
have
jutted
forth
where
the
three
heroes
stood
but
i
do
not
pledge
my
word
for
that
he
answered
smilingly
to
caroline
for
the
legend
which
says
that
their
spirits
sleep
in
the
rocky
vale
under
seelisberg
ready
to
come
forth
and
lead
the
people
in
moments
of
hope
their
slumbers
may
never
be
disturbed
she
replied
i
wish
some
one
would
prevent
these
cattle
from
frightening
the
horses
as
a
large
drove
swept
past
our
carriages
making
our
steeds
nervous
splendid
animals
they
were
with
beautiful
heads
straight
backs
light
limbs
and
of
a
grayish
mouse
color
of
the
celebrated
schwytz
breed
said
herr
h
part
of
the
country
is
renowned
for
its
cattle
each
of
these
probably
cost
from
five
to
six
hundred
francs
the
italians
take
great
advantage
of
this
new
road
and
come
in
numbers
to
buy
them
at
this
season
when
the
cattle
are
returning
from
the
mountains
these
are
going
across
the
gothard
to
lombardy
those
of
einsiedeln
are
still
considered
the
best
do
you
remember
miss
caroline
that
the
first
mention
of
german
authority
in
this
land
was
occasioned
by
a
dispute
between
the
shepherds
of
schwytz
and
the
abbots
of
einsiedeln
about
their
pasturage
the
emperor
having
given
a
grant
of
land
to
the
abbey
while
the
schwytzers
had
never
heard
of
his
existence
even
and
refused
to
obey
his
orders
what
historical
animals
that
quite
reconciles
me
to
them
she
answered
as
we
drove
on
again
amongst
a
group
that
seemed
very
uneasy
under
their
new
masters
whose
sweet
language
george
averred
had
no
power
over
them
who
can
describe
the
exquisite
beauty
of
our
drive
winding
in
and
out
sometimes
through
a
tunnel
at
others
along
the
edge
of
the
high
precipice
from
which
a
low
parapet
alone
separated
us
at
another
passing
through
the
village
of
sisikon
which
years
ago
suffered
severely
from
a
fragment
of
rock
fallen
from
the
frohnalp
above
time
flew
rapidly
and
one
hour
and
a
half
had
glided
by
without
our
perceiving
it
when
we
drew
up
before
the
beautiful
little
inn
of
there
is
no
platform
here
cried
george
are
hundreds
of
feet
above
the
lake
the
critics
are
right
herr
h
decidedly
right
i
knew
it
from
the
beginning
how
can
you
deny
it
my
young
friend
be
so
impatient
just
come
into
the
inn
first
i
should
like
you
to
see
the
lovely
view
from
it
and
then
we
can
look
for
the
saying
which
he
led
us
upstairs
on
through
the
to
its
balcony
on
the
first
floor
this
is
one
of
the
smaller
inns
of
that
olden
type
which
boast
the
enthusiastic
attachment
of
regular
customers
and
display
with
pride
that
old
institution
the
which
has
completely
vanished
from
the
monster
hotels
it
lay
open
on
the
table
as
we
passed
and
every
one
instinctively
stopped
to
examine
it
dear
old
books
exclaimed
c
they
used
to
amuse
me
in
switzerland
i
have
missed
them
so
much
this
time
their
running
fire
of
notes
their
polyglot
verses
a
sort
of
album
and
combined
full
too
of
praise
or
abuse
of
the
last
hotel
as
the
humor
might
said
c
shall
never
forget
the
preface
to
one
an
imprecation
on
whoever
might
be
tempted
to
let
his
pen
go
beyond
bounds
i
learned
it
by
rote
the
mountain
spirits
disturb
his
slumbers
may
his
limbs
be
weary
and
his
feet
sore
may
the
innkeepers
give
him
tough
mutton
and
sour
wine
and
charge
him
for
it
as
though
he
were
lord
sir
john
very
amusing
a
perfect
gem
in
its
way
cried
anna
sir
john
must
have
been
the
model
of
britons
in
his
here
however
everything
seemed
to
be
de
the
only
fault
was
its
monotony
of
praise
two
sisters
keep
the
hotel
and
said
its
devoted
friends
one
find
better
fare
better
attendance
and
greater
happiness
than
at
the
testimony
of
a
young
couple
confessedly
on
their
bridal
tour
had
no
weight
we
know
how
at
that
moment
a
barren
rock
transforms
itself
into
a
paradise
for
them
but
three
maiden
ladies
had
passed
six
weeks
of
unalloyed
enjoyment
here
once
upon
a
time
and
had
returned
often
since
english
clergymen
and
their
families
found
no
words
of
praise
too
strong
while
german
students
and
professors
indulged
in
rhapsodical
language
not
to
be
equalled
out
of
fatherland
duchesses
princesses
and
lords
sir
john
were
alone
wanting
amongst
the
present
guests
they
come
said
herr
h
the
steamers
dine
and
rest
here
awhile
and
return
in
the
evenings
to
the
larger
hotels
in
other
and
standing
on
the
balcony
of
the
facing
all
the
grand
mountains
with
the
green
lake
beneath
it
truly
seemed
a
spot
made
for
brides
and
bridegrooms
for
love
and
friendship
so
absorbed
were
we
in
admiration
of
the
enchanting
view
that
we
did
not
at
first
notice
two
little
maidens
sitting
at
the
far
end
they
were
pretty
children
of
nine
and
thirteen
daughters
of
an
english
family
stopping
here
and
their
countenances
brightened
as
they
heard
our
exclamation
of
delight
for
platte
was
to
them
a
paradise
like
true
britons
however
they
said
nothing
until
george
and
caroline
commenced
disputing
about
the
scenery
comment
then
was
irresistible
said
the
youngest
is
the
isenthal
pointing
to
a
valley
beneath
the
hills
opposite
that
the
urirothstock
with
its
glacier
above
and
the
gütschen
those
straight
walls
of
rock
below
are
the
you
remember
where
schiller
says
blast
rebounding
from
the
minster
has
driven
them
back
on
the
great
that
is
it
and
this
here
is
the
axenberg
said
emily
the
elder
girl
i
see
no
platform
here
remarked
george
with
mischief
in
his
eye
as
he
quickly
detected
the
young
faith
in
the
hero
would
be
impossible
to
see
it
she
rejoined
it
is
three
hundred
feet
below
this
we
can
show
you
the
way
if
you
will
come
continued
the
younger
child
taking
hand
who
partly
from
surprise
and
partly
amusement
allowed
himself
to
be
led
like
a
lamb
across
the
road
and
through
the
garden
to
the
pathway
winding
down
the
cliff
followed
by
us
under
guidance
of
the
elder
sister
emily
the
children
answered
had
spent
the
last
two
years
in
france
and
and
certainly
they
spoke
both
languages
like
natives
emily
was
even
translating
into
english
blank
verse
sighed
c
this
precocious
but
the
lake
of
the
forest
cantons
was
dearer
to
them
than
all
else
they
had
climbed
one
thousand
feet
up
the
side
of
the
frohnalpstock
that
very
morning
with
their
father
knew
every
peak
and
valley
far
and
near
with
all
their
legends
and
histories
even
the
des
and
the
differences
between
them
the
calls
to
the
cows
and
the
goats
annie
our
smaller
friend
entertained
george
with
all
their
varieties
as
she
tripped
daintily
along
like
a
little
fairy
with
her
tiny
alpenstock
very
different
was
she
from
continental
children
who
rarely
if
ever
take
interest
in
either
pastoral
or
literary
matters
she
knew
the
way
to
the
platform
well
for
did
she
not
go
up
and
down
it
many
times
a
day
a
difficult
descent
it
was
too
almost
perpendicular
notwithstanding
the
pathway
but
not
dangerous
until
we
reached
the
bottom
when
each
one
in
turn
had
to
jump
on
to
a
jutting
piece
of
rock
in
order
to
get
round
the
corner
into
the
chapel
most
truly
it
stands
on
a
small
ledge
with
no
inch
of
room
for
aught
but
the
small
building
raised
over
it
the
water
close
up
to
the
shore
is
said
to
be
eight
hundred
feet
deep
and
it
made
one
shudder
to
hear
herr
h
story
of
an
artist
who
a
few
years
ago
fell
into
the
lake
while
sketching
on
the
cliffs
above
poor
man
forgetful
of
the
precipice
he
had
thoughtlessly
stepped
back
a
few
steps
to
look
at
his
painting
fell
over
and
was
never
seen
again
his
easel
and
painting
alone
remained
to
give
pathetic
warning
to
other
rash
spirits
the
chapel
open
on
the
side
next
the
water
is
covered
with
faded
frescos
of
history
which
our
little
friends
quaintly
described
and
it
contains
besides
an
altar
and
a
small
pulpit
here
mass
is
said
once
a
year
on
the
friday
after
the
ascension
when
all
the
people
of
the
neighborhood
come
hither
and
from
their
boats
grouped
outside
hear
mass
and
the
sermon
preached
to
them
from
the
railing
in
front
this
was
the
feast
which
my
weggis
guide
so
much
desired
to
see
it
is
unique
in
every
particular
and
herr
h
was
eloquent
on
the
beauty
and
impressiveness
of
the
scene
at
which
he
had
once
been
present
and
which
it
was
easy
to
understand
amidst
these
magnificent
surroundings
nor
is
it
a
common
gathering
of
peasants
but
a
solemn
celebration
to
which
the
authorities
of
uri
come
in
state
with
the
standard
of
uri
the
renowned
uri
ox
floating
at
the
bows
as
may
be
supposed
the
sermon
is
always
national
touching
on
all
those
points
of
faith
honor
and
dignity
which
constitute
true
patriotism
c
had
in
his
hand
and
would
not
allow
us
to
say
another
word
until
he
read
aloud
sir
james
remarks
on
this
portion
of
the
lake
which
there
occur
as
follows
combination
of
what
is
grandest
in
nature
with
whatever
is
pure
and
sublime
in
human
conduct
affected
me
in
this
passage
along
the
lake
more
powerfully
than
any
scene
which
i
had
ever
seen
perhaps
neither
greece
nor
rome
would
have
had
such
power
over
me
they
are
dead
the
present
inhabitants
are
a
new
race
who
regard
with
little
or
no
feeling
the
memorials
of
former
ages
this
is
perhaps
the
only
place
on
the
globe
where
deeds
of
pure
virtue
ancient
enough
to
be
venerable
are
consecrated
by
the
religion
of
the
people
and
continue
to
command
interest
and
reverence
no
local
superstition
so
beautiful
and
so
moral
anywhere
exists
the
inhabitants
of
thermopylæ
or
marathon
know
no
more
of
these
famous
spots
than
that
they
are
so
many
square
feet
of
earth
england
is
too
extensive
a
country
to
make
runnymede
an
object
of
national
affection
in
countries
of
industry
and
wealth
the
stream
of
events
sweeps
away
these
old
remembrances
the
solitude
of
the
alps
is
a
sanctuary
destined
for
the
monuments
of
ancient
virtue
grütli
and
chapel
are
as
much
reverenced
by
the
alpine
peasants
as
mecca
by
a
devout
mussulman
and
the
deputies
of
the
three
ancient
cantons
met
so
late
as
the
year
to
renew
their
allegiance
and
their
oaths
of
eternal
very
well
said
george
there
really
had
been
a
tell
but
this
seems
to
me
a
body
without
a
soul
why
this
very
chapel
is
in
the
italian
style
and
never
could
have
been
founded
by
the
one
hundred
and
twenty
contemporaries
who
are
said
to
have
known
tell
and
to
have
been
present
at
its
never
heard
that
any
one
insisted
on
this
being
the
original
building
said
herr
h
is
probably
an
improvement
on
it
but
it
was
not
the
fashion
in
those
times
for
people
were
not
then
incredulous
to
put
up
tablets
recording
changes
and
renovations
as
nowadays
at
kaltbad
and
klösterle
for
instance
but
speaking
dispassionately
george
it
seems
to
me
quite
impossible
that
the
introduction
of
any
legend
from
denmark
or
elsewhere
could
have
taken
such
strong
hold
of
a
people
like
these
mountaineers
without
some
solid
foundation
especially
here
where
every
inhabitant
is
known
to
the
other
and
the
same
families
have
lived
on
in
the
same
spots
for
centuries
why
is
it
not
just
as
likely
that
the
same
sort
of
event
should
have
occurred
in
more
than
one
place
and
as
to
its
not
being
mentioned
in
the
local
documents
that
is
not
conclusive
either
for
we
all
know
how
careless
in
these
respects
were
the
men
of
the
middle
ages
above
all
in
a
rude
mountain
canton
of
this
kind
transmission
by
word
of
mouth
and
by
religious
celebrations
is
much
more
in
character
with
those
times
i
go
heart
and
hand
with
your
own
buckle
who
places
so
much
reliance
on
local
traditions
the
main
argument
used
against
the
truth
of
the
story
is
you
know
that
it
was
first
related
in
detail
by
an
old
chronicler
called
ægidius
tschudi
a
couple
of
hundred
years
after
the
event
but
i
see
nothing
singular
in
that
for
most
probably
he
merely
committed
to
writing
with
all
the
freshness
of
simplicity
the
story
which
for
the
previous
two
hundred
years
had
been
in
the
hearts
and
on
the
lips
of
the
peasants
of
this
region
no
invention
of
any
writer
could
have
founded
chapels
or
have
become
ingrained
in
the
hearts
of
the
locality
itself
in
the
manner
this
story
has
done
it
was
never
doubted
until
the
end
of
the
last
century
when
a
freudenberger
of
bern
wrote
a
pamphlet
entitled
tell
a
danish
broke
in
little
emily
latest
translator
of
schiller
and
who
had
been
listening
attentively
to
our
discussion
the
people
of
the
forest
cantons
were
so
indignant
that
the
authorities
of
uri
had
the
pamphlet
burned
by
the
common
hangman
and
then
they
solemnly
proclaimed
its
author
an
told
you
george
that
you
were
on
dangerous
ground
here
said
herr
h
laughing
must
make
him
kiss
this
earth
before
he
leaves
said
c
i
read
lately
of
a
mother
making
her
little
son
do
when
passing
here
early
in
this
century
regarding
it
as
a
spot
sacred
to
liberty
she
little
thought
a
sceptic
like
you
would
so
soon
i
am
converted
he
answered
smiling
i
wish
miss
emily
would
tell
us
the
story
of
jumping
on
shore
here
trying
to
draw
out
the
enthusiastic
little
prodigy
you
remember
that
magnificent
passage
in
schiller
where
after
the
scene
of
shooting
at
the
apple
gessler
asked
tell
why
he
put
the
second
arrow
into
his
quiver
and
then
promising
to
spare
his
life
if
he
revealed
its
object
evades
his
promise
the
instant
he
hears
that
it
was
destined
to
kill
him
if
tell
had
struck
his
son
instead
of
the
apple
he
then
ordered
him
to
be
bound
and
taken
on
board
his
vessel
at
fluelen
the
boat
had
no
sooner
left
fluelen
than
one
of
those
sudden
storms
sprang
up
so
common
hereabouts
there
was
one
two
days
ago
annie
and
i
tried
to
come
down
here
but
it
was
impossible
the
wind
and
waves
were
so
high
we
could
not
venture
so
we
sat
on
the
pathway
and
read
out
schiller
oh
he
is
a
great
genius
he
never
was
in
switzerland
yes
just
fancy
that
and
yet
he
describes
everything
to
perfection
well
tell
was
as
good
a
pilot
as
a
marksman
and
gessler
in
his
fright
again
promised
to
take
off
his
fetters
if
he
would
steer
the
vessel
safely
he
did
but
steered
them
straight
towards
this
ledge
of
rock
sprang
out
upon
it
climbed
up
the
cliff
and
rushing
through
the
country
arrived
at
the
near
küssnacht
before
the
tyrant
had
reached
decidedly
has
his
merit
it
must
be
confessed
when
he
can
get
such
ardent
admirers
as
these
pretty
children
said
herr
h
when
we
bade
farewell
to
our
dear
little
friends
answered
the
incorrigible
george
from
the
box
seat
poetry
an
excellent
mode
of
transmitting
traditions
making
them
indelible
on
young
minds
but
i
am
so
far
converted
herr
h
continued
he
laughing
i
am
sorry
the
doubts
were
ever
raised
about
the
tell
history
it
is
in
wonderful
keeping
with
the
place
and
people
and
it
will
be
a
great
pity
if
give
it
up
non

at
hence
onwards
to
fluelen
is
the
finest
portion
of
the
axenstrasse
and
the
opening
views
of
the
valley
of
the
reuss
and
the
bristenstock
through
the
arches
of
the
galleries
or
tunnels
every
minute
increased
in
beauty
several
of
us
got
out
the
better
to
enjoy
them
sending
the
carriages
on
ahead
the
schwytz
cattle
had
quite
escaped
our
memories
when
suddenly
a
bell
sounded
round
a
sharp
angle
of
the
road
and
a
large
drove
instantly
followed
a
panic
seized
us
ladies
the
cliff
rose
vertically
on
the
inner
side
without
allowing
us
the
possibility
of
a
clamber
and
in
our
fright
before
the
gentlemen
could
prevent
us
we
leaped
over
a
low
railing
which
there
served
as
a
parapet
on
to
a
ledge
of
rock
a
few
yards
square
rising
straight
up
from
the
lake
hundreds
of
feet
below
all
recollection
of
their
historical
interest
vanished
from
our
minds
for
as
the
cattle
danced
along
they
looked
as
scared
and
wild
as
ourselves
and
it
was
not
until
they
had
passed
without
noticing
us
and
that
their
masters
had
spoken
some
soft
italian
words
to
us
that
we
fully
realized
the
extent
of
our
imprudence
had
any
one
of
these
animals
jumped
up
over
the
railing
as
we
afterwards
heard
they
have
sometimes
done
who
can
say
what
might
not
have
happened
fortunately
no
harm
ensued
beyond
a
flutter
of
nerves
which
betrayed
itself
by
turning
round
to
a
set
of
handsome
goats
that
soon
followed
the
cattle
crying
out
to
them
in
her
own
peculiar
german
kommen
nix
kommen
fluelen
has
nothing
to
show
beyond
the
picturesqueness
of
a
village
situated
in
such
scenery
and
a
collection
of
lumbering
diligences
and
countless
carriages
awaiting
the
hourly
arrival
of
the
steamers
from
lucerne
the
knell
of
these
old
diligences
however
has
tolled
for
the
gothard
railway
tunnel
has
been
commenced
near
arnsty
and
though
it
may
require
years
to
finish
it
its
will
surely
come
half
an
drive
up
the
lovely
valley
brought
us
to
altorf
at
the
foot
of
the
grünwald
which
in
accord
with
its
name
is
clothed
with
a
virgin
forest
now
called
the
forest
because
so
useful
is
it
in
protecting
the
town
from
avalanches
and
landslips
that
the
uri
government
never
permits
it
to
be
touched
altorf
like
so
many
of
the
capitals
in
these
forest
cantons
has
a
small
population
inhabitants
only
but
it
has
many
good
houses
for
it
was
burnt
down
in
and
rebuilt
in
a
better
manner
story
forms
its
chief
interest
and
certainly
did
so
in
our
eyes
we
rushed
at
once
to
the
square
where
one
fountain
is
said
to
mark
the
spot
where
tell
took
aim
and
another
that
upon
which
his
boy
stood
tradition
says
that
the
latter
one
replaced
the
against
which
the
son
leant
portions
of
which
existed
until
a
paltry
plaster
statue
of
the
hero
is
in
the
same
square
but
the
most
remarkable
relic
of
antiquity
is
an
old
tower
close
by
which
herr
h
assured
us
is
proved
by
documents
to
have
been
built
before
the
date
of
history
had
the
young
friends
we
left
at
accompanied
us
hither
emily
might
have
quoted
schiller
to
us
at
length
but
george
having
recently
bought
a
tauchnitz
edition
of
of
the
english
which
opens
with
a
fine
description
of
the
annual
elections
of
this
canton
he
earnestly
pleaded
a
prolongation
of
our
drive
to
the
spot
where
this
takes
place
three
miles
further
inland
accordingly
after
ordering
dinner
to
be
ready
on
our
return
at
a
hotel
which
was
filled
with
tell
pictures
and
an
excellent
one
of
the
festival
at
the
platform
we
left
the
town
and
proceeded
up
the
valley
soon
we
crossed
a
stream
the
same
herr
h
told
us
in
which
tell
is
said
to
have
been
drowned
while
endeavoring
to
save
a
child
who
had
fallen
into
it
he
also
pointed
out
to
us
bürglen
his
home
and
an
old
tower
believed
to
have
been
his
house
attached
to
which
there
is
now
a
small
chapel
it
stands
at
the
opening
of
the
schächen
valley
celebrated
to
this
day
for
its
fine
race
of
men
likewise
corresponding
in
this
respect
with
the
old
tradition
but
more
modern
interest
attaches
to
this
valley
for
it
was
along
its
craggy
sides
and
precipices
that
army
made
its
way
across
the
to
the
muotta
the
whole
of
this
region
was
the
scene
of
fearful
fighting
first
between
the
french
and
the
austrians
who
were
assisted
by
the
natives
of
uri
in
and
then
a
month
later
between
the
russians
coming
up
from
lombardy
and
the
french
was
the
age
of
real
fighting
said
herr
h
fighting
without
or
long
ranges
but
the
misery
it
brought
this
quarter
was
not
recovered
from
for
years
after
altorf
was
burnt
down
at
that
time
and
everything
laid
waste
the
memory
of
the
trouble
lingers
about
here
even
yet
what
wonder
certainly
in
all
europe
no
more
difficult
fighting
ground
could
have
been
found
in
the
end
the
french
general
lecourbe
was
all
but
cut
off
for
he
had
destroyed
every
boat
on
the
lake
in
those
days
a
most
serious
matter
as
neither
steamers
nor
axenstrasse
existed
when
he
therefore
wished
to
pursue
the
russians
who
by
going
up
this
schächen
valley
intended
to
join
their
own
corps
supposed
to
be
at
zürich
he
too
was
obliged
to
make
a
bold
manœuvre
and
then
it
was
that
he
led
his
army
by
torchlight
along
the
dangerous
on
the
axenberg
sad
and
dreadful
times
they
were
for
these
poor
herr
h
showed
us
attinghausen
the
of
walter
fürst
and
the
ruins
of
a
castle
near
which
is
the
locality
of
a
fine
scene
in
schiller
but
the
last
owner
of
which
died
in
and
is
known
to
have
been
buried
in
his
helmet
and
spurs
shortly
after
about
three
miles
from
altorf
we
reached
the
noted
field
and
george
opening
freeman
read
us
the
following
passage
aloud
by
year
on
certain
spots
among
the
dales
and
the
of
switzerland
the
traveller
who
is
daring
enough
to
wander
out
of
beaten
tracks
and
to
make
his
journey
at
unusual
seasons
may
look
on
a
sight
such
as
no
other
corner
of
the
earth
can
any
longer
set
before
him
he
may
there
gaze
and
feel
what
none
can
feel
but
those
who
have
seen
with
their
own
eyes
what
none
can
feel
in
its
fulness
more
than
once
in
a
lifetime
the
thrill
of
looking
for
the
first
time
face
to
face
on
freedom
in
its
purest
and
most
ancient
form
he
is
there
in
a
land
where
the
oldest
institutions
of
our
race
institutions
which
may
be
traced
up
to
the
earliest
times
of
which
history
or
legend
gives
us
any
glimmering
still
live
on
in
their
primeval
freshness
he
is
in
a
land
where
an
immemorial
freedom
a
freedom
only
less
eternal
than
the
rocks
that
guard
it
puts
to
shame
the
boasted
antiquity
of
kingly
dynasties
which
by
its
side
seem
but
as
innovations
of
yesterday
there
year
by
year
on
some
bright
morning
of
the
springtide
the
sovereign
people
not
entrusting
its
rights
to
a
few
of
its
own
number
but
discharging
them
itself
in
the
majesty
of
its
corporate
person
meets
in
the
open
or
in
the
green
meadow
at
the
foot
to
frame
the
laws
to
which
it
yields
obedience
as
its
own
work
to
choose
the
rulers
whom
it
can
afford
to
greet
with
reverence
as
drawing
their
commission
from
itself
such
a
sight
there
are
but
few
englishmen
who
have
seen
to
be
among
these
few
i
reckon
among
the
highest
privileges
of
my
life
let
me
ask
you
to
follow
me
in
spirit
to
the
very
home
and
of
freedom
to
the
land
where
we
need
not
myth
and
fable
to
add
aught
to
the
fresh
and
gladdening
feeling
with
which
we
for
the
first
time
tread
the
soil
and
drink
in
the
air
of
the
immemorial
democracy
of
uri
it
is
one
of
the
opening
days
of
may
it
is
the
morning
of
sunday
for
men
there
deem
that
the
better
the
day
the
better
the
deed
they
deem
that
the
creator
can
not
be
more
truly
honored
than
in
using
in
his
fear
and
in
his
presence
the
highest
of
the
gifts
which
he
has
bestowed
on
man
but
deem
not
that
because
the
day
of
christian
worship
is
chosen
for
the
great
yearly
assembly
of
a
christian
commonwealth
the
more
directly
sacred
duties
of
the
day
are
forgotten
before
we
in
our
luxurious
island
have
lifted
ourselves
from
our
beds
the
men
of
the
mountains
catholics
and
protestants
alike
have
already
paid
the
worship
in
temple
they
have
heard
the
mass
of
the
priest
or
they
have
listened
to
the
sermon
of
the
pastor
before
some
of
us
have
awakened
to
the
fact
that
the
morn
of
the
holy
day
has
come
and
when
i
saw
men
thronging
the
crowded
church
or
kneeling
for
want
of
space
within
on
the
bare
ground
beside
the
open
door
when
i
saw
them
marching
thence
to
do
the
highest
duties
of
men
and
citizens
i
could
hardly
forbear
thinking
of
the
saying
of
holy
writ
that
the
spirit
of
the
lord
is
there
is
from
the
of
altorf
the
little
capital
of
the
canton
the
procession
makes
its
way
to
the
place
of
meeting
at
bözlingen
first
marches
the
little
army
of
the
canton
an
army
whose
weapons
never
can
be
used
save
to
drive
back
an
invader
from
their
land
over
their
heads
floats
the
banner
the
of
uri
the
ensign
which
led
men
to
victory
on
the
fields
of
sempach
and
morgarten
and
before
them
all
on
the
shoulders
of
men
clad
in
a
garb
of
ages
past
are
borne
the
famous
horns
the
spoils
of
the
wild
bull
of
ancient
days
the
very
horns
whose
blast
struck
such
dread
into
the
fearless
heart
of
charles
of
burgundy
then
with
their
lictors
before
them
come
the
magistrates
of
the
commonwealth
on
horseback
the
the
landamman
with
his
sword
by
his
side
the
people
follow
the
chiefs
whom
they
have
chosen
to
the
place
of
meeting
a
circle
in
a
green
meadow
with
a
pine
forest
rising
above
their
heads
and
a
mighty
spur
of
the
mountain
range
facing
them
on
the
other
side
of
the
valley
the
multitude
of
freemen
take
their
seats
around
the
chief
ruler
of
the
commonwealth
whose
term
of
office
comes
that
day
to
an
end
the
assembly
opens
a
short
space
is
given
to
prayer
silent
prayer
offered
up
by
each
man
in
the
temple
of
own
rearing
then
comes
the
business
of
the
day
if
changes
in
the
law
are
demanded
they
are
then
laid
before
the
vote
of
the
assembly
in
which
each
citizen
of
full
age
has
an
equal
vote
and
an
equal
right
of
speech
the
yearly
magistrates
have
now
discharged
all
their
duties
their
term
of
office
is
at
an
end
the
trust
that
has
been
placed
in
their
hands
falls
back
into
the
hands
of
those
by
whom
it
was
given
into
the
hands
of
the
sovereign
people
the
chief
of
the
commonwealth
now
such
no
longer
leaves
his
seat
of
office
and
takes
his
place
as
a
simple
citizen
in
the
ranks
of
his
fellows
it
rests
with
the
of
the
assembly
to
call
him
back
to
his
chair
of
office
or
to
set
another
there
in
his
stead
men
who
have
neither
looked
into
the
history
of
the
past
nor
yet
troubled
themselves
to
learn
what
happens
year
by
year
in
their
own
age
are
fond
of
declaiming
against
the
caprice
and
ingratitude
of
the
people
and
of
telling
us
that
under
a
democratic
government
neither
men
nor
measures
can
remain
for
an
hour
unchanged
the
witness
alike
of
the
present
and
of
the
past
is
an
answer
to
baseless
theories
like
these
the
spirit
which
made
democratic
athens
year
by
year
bestow
her
highest
offices
on
the
patrician
pericles
and
the
reactionary
phocion
still
lives
in
the
democracies
of
switzerland
alike
in
the
landesgemeinde
of
uri
and
in
the
federal
assembly
at
bern
the
ministers
of
kings
whether
despotic
or
constitutional
may
vainly
envy
the
sure
tenure
of
office
which
falls
to
the
lot
of
those
who
are
chosen
to
rule
by
the
voice
of
the
people
alike
in
the
whole
confederation
and
in
the
single
canton
is
the
rule
the
rejection
of
the
outgoing
magistrate
is
the

were
a
just

us

have

his

with
rare
judgment

allowing
his

great
part
for

the

with
have
a
dramatic
interest
which
is
greatly
increased
by
the
quaint
and
nervous
style
of
the
time
in
which
they
express
themselves
we
feel
too
that
it
is
the
very
innermost
soul
and
mind
of
the
individual
that
is
being
revealed
to
us
and
certainly
in
most
of
them
the
revelation
is
so
beautiful
that
we
should
possibly
have
ascribed
something
of
this
to
the
partiality
of
a
panegyrist
or
to
his
descriptive
skill
if
the
picture
had
been
sketched
by
the
pen
of
any
other
biographer
than
themselves
it
is
indeed
the
mean
opinion
they
evidently
have
of
themselves
and
the
naïve
and
modest
manner
in
which
they
relate
incidents
evoking
heroic
virtue
their
absolute
unconsciousness
of
aught
more
than
the
most
ordinary
qualities
which
fascinate
us
it
bears
an
impress
of
genuineness
impossible
to
any
description
by
the
most
impartial
of

they
express
a
beauty
which
could
no

be

morris
learn
not
only
what
was
done
by
the
strong
and
brave
but
also
by
the
weak
and
we
are
much
struck
in
this
history
with
the
resemblance
between
those
times
and
the
present
in
the
unsparing
calumny
of
which
the
purest
and
the
holiest
men
were
made
the
victims
for
confirmation
of
these
remarks
we
refer
the
reader
to
the
book
itself
but
we
can
not
refrain
from
quoting
in
spite
of
its
length
the
following
incident
related
by
father
weston
it
is
a
remarkable
example
of
the
salutary
effect
of
the
sacrament
of
penance
there
lay
in
a
certain
heretical
house
a
catholic
who
with
the
consent
of
his
keeper
had
come
to
london
for
the
completion
of
some
urgent
business
he
had
been
committed
to
a
prison
in
the
country
a
good
way
out
of
london
he
was
seized
however
and
overpowered
by
a
long
sickness
which
brought
him
near
to
death
the
woman
who
nursed
him
being
a
catholic
had
diligently
searched
the
whole
city
through
to
find
a
priest
but
in
vain
she
then
sent
word
to
me
of
the
peril
of
that
person
and
entreated
me
if
it
could
be
contrived
to
come
to
his
assistance
as
he
was
almost
giving
up
the
ghost
i
went
to
him
when
the
little
piece
of
gold
obtained
for
me
the
liberty
to
do
so
i
explained
that
i
was
a
priest
for
i
was
dressed
like
a
layman
and
that
i
had
come
to
hear
his
confession
that
is
the
reason
why
you
have
come
it
is
in
vain
he
said
time
for
it
is
passed
i
said
to
him
are
you
not
a
catholic
if
you
are
you
know
what
you
have
to
do
this
hour
which
seems
to
be
your
last
has
been
given
you
that
by
making
a
good
and
sincere
confession
you
may
while
there
is
time
wash
away
the
stains
of
your
past
life
whatever
they
he
answered
tell
you
that
you
have
come
too
late
that
time
has
gone
by
the
judgment
is
decided
the
sentence
has
been
pronounced
i
am
condemned
and
given
up
to
the
enemy
i
can
not
hope
for
is
false
i
answered
it
is
a
most
fearful
error
to
imagine
that
a
man
still
in
life
can
assert
that
he
is
already
deprived
of
goodness
and
abandoned
by
his
grace
in
such
a
way
that
even
when
he
desires
and
implores
mercy
it
should
be
denied
him
since
your
faith
teaches
you
that
god
is
infinitely
merciful
you
are
to
believe
with
all
certitude
that
there
is
no
bond
so
straitly
fastened
but
the
grace
of
god
can
unloose
it
no
obstacle
but
grace
has
power
to
surmount
do
you
not
see
he
asked
me
full
of
evil
spirits
this
place
is
where
we
are
there
is
no
corner
or
crevice
in
the
walls
where
there
are
not
more
than
a
thousand
of
the
most
dark
and
frightful
demons
who
with
their
fierce
faces
horrid
looks
and
atrocious
words
threaten
perpetually
that
they
are
just
going
to
carry
me
into
the
abyss
of
misery
why
even
my
very
body
and
entrails
are
filled
with
these
hateful
guests
who
are
lacerating
my
body
and
torturing
my
soul
with
such
dreadful
cruelty
and
anguish
that
it
seems
as
if
i
were
not
so
much
on
the
point
merely
of
going
there
as
that
i
am
already
devoted
and
made
over
to
the
flames
and
agonies
of
hell
wherefore
it
is
clear
that
god
has
abandoned
me
for
ever
and
has
cast
me
away
from
all
hope
of
i
had
listened
in
trembling
to
all
these
things
and
to
much
more
of
a
similar
kind
and
saw
at
the
same
time
that
death
was
coming
fast
upon
him
and
that
he
would
not
admit
of
any
advice
or
persuasion
i
began
to
think
within
myself
in
silence
and
anxiety
what
would
be
the
wisest
course
to
choose
there
entered
into
my
mind
through
the
inspiration
doubtless
of
god
the
following
most
useful
plan
and
method
of
dealing
with
him
then
i
said
you
are
going
to
be
lost
i
do
not
require
a
confession
from
you
nevertheless
recollect
yourself
just
for
a
moment
and
with
a
quiet
mind
answer
me
in
a
few
words
either
yes
or
no
to
the
questions
that
i
put
to
you
i
ask
for
nothing
else
and
put
upon
you
no
other
then
i
began
to
question
him
and
to
follow
the
order
of
the
commandments
first
whether
he
had
denied
his
faith
i
said
not
worry
yourself
say
just
those
simple
words
yes
or
as
soon
as
he
had
finished
either
affirming
or
denying
anything
i
proceeded
through
four
or
five
commandments
whether
he
had
killed
any
one
stolen
anything
etc
when
he
had
answered
with
tolerable
calmness
i
said
to
him
are
the
devils
doing
now
what
do
you
feel
or
suffer
from
them
he
replied
are
quieter
with
me
they
do
not
seem
to
be
so
furious
as
they
were
up
your
soul
to
god
i
said
let
us
go
on
to
the
in
the
same
fashion
and
order
i
continued
to
question
him
about
other
things
then
i
enquired
again
saying
is
it
now
he
replied
i
am
not
tormented
the
devils
stand
at
a
distance
they
throw
stones
they
make
dreadful
faces
at
me
and
threaten
me
horribly
i
do
not
think
that
i
shall
going
forward
as
before
i
allured
and
encouraged
the
man
by
degrees
till
every
moment
he
became
more
reasonable
and
at
last
made
an
entire
confession
of
all
his
sins
after
which
i
gave
him
absolution
and
asked
him
what
he
was
suffering
from
his
cruel
and
harassing
enemies
he
said
have
all
vanished
there
is
not
a
trace
of
them
thanks
be
to
then
i
went
away
after
strengthening
him
by
a
few
words
and
encouraging
him
beforehand
against
temptations
which
might
return
i
promised
at
the
same
time
that
i
would
be
with
him
on
the
morrow
and
meant
to
bring
the
most
sacred
body
of
christ
with
me
and
warned
him
to
prepare
himself
diligently
for
the
receiving
of
so
excellent
a
banquet
the
whole
following
night
he
passed
without
molestation
from
the
enemy
and
on
the
next
day
he
received
with
great
tranquillity
of
mind
the
most
holy
sacrament
after
which
at
an
interval
of
a
few
hours
without
disturbance
he
breathed
forth
his
soul
and
quietly
gave
it
up
to
god
before
he
died
i
asked
the
man
what
cause
had
driven
him
into
such
desperation
of
mind
he
answered
me
thus
was
detained
in
prison
many
years
for
the
catholic
faith
nevertheless
i
did
not
cease
to
sin
and
to
conceal
my
sins
from
my
confessor
being
persuaded
by
the
devil
that
pardon
must
be
sought
for
from
god
rather
by
penances
and
severity
of
life
than
by
confession
hence
i
either
neglected
my
confessions
altogether
or
else
made
insincere
ones
and
so
i
fell
into
that
melancholy
of
mind
and
that
state
of
tribulation
which
has
been
my
light
leading
unto
light
a
series
of
sonnets
and
poems
by
john
charles
earle
london
burns
oates
earle
has
undoubtedly
a
facility
in
writing
sonnets
and
a
good
sonnet
has
been
well
called
whole
poem
in
it
is
also
we
think
peculiarly
suitable
for
didactic
poetry
the
present
sonnets
are
in
advance
we
consider
of
those
we
first
saw
from
pen
but
we
still
observe
faults
both
of
diction
and
of
verse
which
he
should
have
learnt
to
avoid
his
model
seems
to
be
wordsworth
the
greatest
sonneteer
in
our
language
but
like
him
he
has
too
much
of
the
prosaic
and
the
artificial
we
wish
we
could
bestow
unqualified
praise
upon
the
ideas
throughout
these
sonnets
and
were
there
nothing
for
criticism
but
what
may
be
called
poetic
subtleties
such
as
the
german
notion
of
an
body
developed
during
life
and
hatched
at
death
for
our
intermediate
state
of
being
we
should
have
no
quarrel
with
earle
but
when
we
meet
two
sonnets
xlviii
and
xlix
headed
and
we
have
a
philosophical
error
serious
in
its
consequences
and
are
not
surprised
to
find
the
two
following
sonnets
teach
pantheism
in
sonnet
xlviii
the
excellent
intention
is
to
refute
materialism
is
you
say
function
of
the
brain
and
matter
all
that
we
can
ever
know

he
has
a
way
of
explaining
it
to
himself
which
makes
it
sound
perfectly
orthodox
but
we
do
call
such
a
blunder
inexcusable
in
a
catholic
writer
of
pretensions
the
title
of
his
volume
leading

has
little
to

there

in

the

all
the

have
a
presentiment
of
coming
judgment
and
that
presentiment
is
strong
in
proportion
to
their
faith
stronger
still
in
proportion
to
their
charity
let
our
readers
be
assured
at
the
outset
we
are
not
about
to
imitate
the
irreverence
of
the
scotch
presbyterian
minister
who
some
few
years
ago
pretended
that
he
had
discovered
in
the
prophetic
visions
of
john
the
year
in
which
will
come
to
pass
that
event
of
stupendous
awfulness
of
which
he
before
whom
all
mankind
will
then
be
judged
said
that
day
or
hour
no
one
knows
neither
the
angels
in
heaven
nor
the
son
but
the
father
one
fearful
catastrophe
however
to
befall
mankind
before
the
general
judgment
is
insisted
on
so
often
and
with
such
solemn
emphasis
by
the
holy
spirit
that
the
love
of
god
seems
to
be
as
it
were
trembling
for
his
redeemed
creature
and
longing
to
reveal
to
him
more
than
is
consistent
with
his
own
designs
in
the
trial
of
his
faith
for
it
must
be
remembered
that
faith
is
a
merit
and
the
absolutely
indispensable
condition
of
our
receiving
the
benefits
of
the
divine
atonement
although
the
gift
of
god
it
is
the
part
we
ourselves
by
with
the
gift
contribute
towards
our
own
salvation
and
what
we
are
required
to
believe
is
so
beautiful
and
ennobling
to
the
moral
sense
and
so
satisfying
to
the
reason
that
supported
as
it
is
by
the
historical
evidence
of
the
divinity
of
christ
and
of
his
church
no
one
can
refuse
to
believe
but
those
who
deliberately
choose
darkness
rather
than
light
sin
rather
than
virtue
satan
rather
than
god
yet
so
formidable
was
to
be
that
last
trial
of
the
faith
of
christians
so
crucial
that
conclusive
test
of
their
charity
which
was
to
if
it
were
possible
even
the
very
elect
that
the
spirit
of
love
yearning
for
the
safety
of
his
regenerate
ones
and
compassionating
the
weakness
of
human
nature
revealed
its
marks
and
signs
in
the
fullest
and
most
circumstantial
detail
so
that
warned
of
the
danger
and
recognizing
it
when
it
arrived
they
might
pass
through
it
unhurt
whilst
those
who
succumbed
to
it
might
be
without
excuse
before
the
divine
justice
it
is
the
yearning
of
the
heart
of
christ
towards
his
children
whom
he
foresees
will
fail
by
thousands
in
that
decisive
trial
which
prompts
the
ejaculation
that
sounds
almost
like
a
lament
over
his
own
inability
to
put
any
pressure
on
their
the
son
of
man
cometh
will
he
find
faith
on
the
earth
it
is
his
anxiety
as
it
were
about
the
fate
of
his
elect
amidst
the
seductions
of
that
appalling
apostasy
which
urged
him
after
he
had
indicated
the
signs
that
would
accompany
it
to
be
on
the
perpetual
sleepless
lookout
for
them
ever
on
the
alert
lo
i
have
foretold
you
ever
on
the
alert
watch
and
pray
for
you
do
not
know
when
the
time
may
then
lest
when
he
the
head
of
the
family
shall
have
come
on
a
sudden
you
be
found
what
i
say
to
you
i
to
watch
throughout
all
the
ages
that
have
elapsed
since
those
words
of
solemn
import
fell
from
the
lips
of
jesus
christ
it
has
been
the
plain
duty
of
all
christians
nay
of
all
to
whose
knowledge
they
were
brought
to
narrowly
scrutinize
events
to
keep
their
attention
fixed
upon
them
watching
for
the
signs
he
foretold
lest
they
should
appear
unheeded
and
they
be
seduced
from
the
faith
or
be
the
cause
through
their
indifference
of
others
being
carried
away
in
the
great
misleading
but
who
now
can
be
insensible
to
the
predicted
portents
so
notorious
are
they
and
so
exactly
do
they
answer
to
the
description
of
them
handed
down
to
us
from
the
beginning
that
they
rudely
arouse
us
from
sleep
that
they
force
our
attention
however
indifferent
to
them
we
may
be
however
dull
our
faith
or
cold
our
charity
and
when
we
see
a
vast
organization
advancing
its
forces
in
one
united
movement
throughout
the
entire
globe
in
an
avowed
attack
as
insidious
as
it
is
formidable
upon
altars
thrones
social
order
christianity
christ
and
god
himself
where
is
the
heart
that
can
be
insensible
to
the
touching
evidence
of
loving
solicitude
which
urged
him
whom
surging
multitudes
of
his
false
creatures
were
deliberately
to
reject
in
favor
of
a
fouler
being
than
barabbas
to
iterate
so
often
the
warning
admonition
ever
on
the
to
study
therefore
the
signs
of
the
times
can
not
be
without
profit
to
all
but
especially
to
us
who
have
but
scant
respect
for
the
spirit
of
the
age
who
are
not
sufficiently
enlightened
by
it
to
look
upon
christ
as
nothing
more
than
a
remarkable
man
the
sublime
morality
he
taught
and
set
an
example
of
as
a
nuisance
and
his
church
as
the
enemy
of
mankind
to
be
extirpated
from
their
midst
because
it
forbids
their
enjoying
the
illumination
of
the
secrets
of
the
craft
of
freemasonry
to
fix
the
date
of
the
is
completely
out
of
our
power
it
is
irreverent
if
not
blasphemous
to
attempt
it
it
is
of
the
counsels
of
god
that
it
should
come
with
the
swiftness
of
and
the
unexpectedness
of
thief
in
the
and
that
expressly
that
we
may
be
ever
on
the
watch
but
the
signs
of
its
approach
are
given
to
us
in
order
to
help
those
who
do
not
abandon
in
indifference
to
escape
the
great
delusion
the
imposition
of
antichrist
which
is
to
immediately
precede
it
it
is
these
signs
we
propose
to
study
in
the
following
pages
the
predictions
of
christ
himself
on
this
subject
are
far
more
obscure
than
those
subsequently
given
to
us
by
his
apostles
but
this
has
always
been
way
of
revelation
to
his
creature
to
moses
alone
in
the
mount
he
revealed
the
moral
law
and
that
wondrous
theocratic
polity
which
remained
even
after
the
perversity
of
his
people
had
given
it
a
monarchical
form
and
moses
communicated
it
to
the
people
to
the
people
christ
spoke
in
parables
without
a
parable
spake
he
not
unto
them
but
when
he
was
alone
with
them
he
explained
all
to
his
you
he
said
is
given
to
have
known
the
mystery
of
the
kingdom
of
god
but
to
those
without
everything
is
a
the
apostles
themselves
who
were
to
declare
the
revelation
in
order
to
increase
the
merit
of
their
faith
were
not
fully
illuminated
before
the
coming
down
of
the
holy
spirit
do
not
know
this
parable
he
said
how
are
you
going
to
understand
all
parables
to
their
utterances
therefore
it
is
we
shall
confine
ourselves
as
shedding
as
much
light
as
it
has
seemed
good
to
the
holy
ghost
to
disclose
to
us
upon
the
profounder
and
more
oracular
predictions
of
god
himself
in
the
flesh
besides
ss
peter
paul
and
john
jude
is
the
only
other
apostle
we
believe
who
has
bequeathed
to
the
church
predictions
of
the
terrible
apostasy
of
antichrist
which
is
to
consummate
the
trial
of
the
faith
of
the
saints
under
the
very
shadow
of
the
coming
judgment
we
will
take
them
in
the
order
in
which
they
occur
the
first
is
in
a
letter
of
paul
to
the
church
at
thessalonica
where
exhorting
them
not
to
terrified
as
if
the
day
of
the
lord
were
at
hand
he
assures
them
that
it
will
not
come
there
shall
have
first
happened
an
apostasy
and
the
man
of
sin
shall
have
been
revealed
the
son
of
perdition
he
who
opposes
himself
to
and
raises
himself
above
all
that
is
called
god
or
that
is
held
in
honor
so
that
he
may
sit
in
the
temple
of
god
showing
himself
as
if
he
were
and
you
know
what
now
is
hindering
his
being
revealed
in
his
own
time
for
the
mystery
of
iniquity
is
already
working
only
so
that
he
who
is
now
keeping
it
in
check
will
keep
it
in
check
until
he
be
moved
out
of
its
way
and
then
will
the
lawless
one
be
revealed
whom
the
lord
jesus
will
slay
with
the
breath
of
his
mouth
and
destroy
with
the
illumination
of
his
coming
whose
coming
is
after
the
manner
of
working
of
satan
with
all
strength
and
symbols
and
lying
absurdities
and
in
every
enticement
of
iniquity
in
those
who
perish
for
the
reason
that
they
did
not
receive
the
love
of
the
truth
that
they
might
be
saved
so
god
will
send
them
the
working
of
error
that
they
may
believe
falsehood
that
all
may
be
judged
who
have
not
believed
the
truth
but
have
consented
to
in
a
letter
to
timothy
bishop
of
ephesus
paul
writes
the
spirit
says
expressly
that
in
the
last
times
some
shall
apostatize
from
the
faith
giving
heed
to
spirits
of
error
and
to
doctrines
of
demons
speaking
falsehood
in
hypocrisy
and
having
their
own
conscience
in
a
second
letter
to
the
same
bishop
he
writes
this
moreover
that
in
the
last
days
there
will
be
a
pressure
of
perilous
times
men
will
be
covetous
lifted
up
proud
blasphemous
disobedient
to
parents
ungrateful
malicious
without
affection
discontented
calumniators
incontinent
hard
unamiable
traitors
froward
fearful
and
lovers
of
pleasures
more
than
lovers
of
god
having
indeed
a
form
of
piety
but
denying
its
peter
writes
that
will
come
in
the
last
days
mockers
in
deception
walking
according
to
their
own
jude
describes
them
as
walking
in
impieties
according
to
their
own
desires
these
are
they
who
separate
themselves
animals
not
having
the
it
would
seem
from
the
expressions
of
of
all
the
apostles
appears
to
have
had
most
the
gift
of
prophecy
as
well
as
from
the
manner
in
which
the
last
days
of
jerusalem
and
the
last
days
of
the
world
appear
to
be
mingled
together
in
the
of
christ
that
powerful
manifestations
of
antichrist
were
to
precede
both
events
although
the
apostasy
was
to
be
far
more
extensive
and
destructive
before
the
latter
children
writes
the
favorite
apostle
is
the
last
time
and
as
you
have
heard
that
antichrist
comes
so
now
many
have
become
antichrists
whence
we
know
that
it
is
the
last
he
is
antichrist
who
denies
the
father
and
the
spirit
who
abolishes
jesus
is
not
of
god
and
he
is
antichrist
about
whom
we
have
heard
that
he
is
coming
and
is
even
now
in
the
we
believe
that
these
are
the
only
passages
wherein
the
holy
ghost
has
vouchsafed
to
give
us
distinct
and
definite
information
as
to
the
marks
and
evidences
by
which
we
are
to
know
that
there
is
amongst
us
that
antichrist
whose
disastrous
although
triumph
is
to
precede
by
only
a
short
space
the
end
of
time
and
the
eternal
enfranchisement
of
good
from
evil
the
prophetic
utterances
on
this
subject
in
the
revelations
of
john
are
veiled
in
such
exceedingly
obscure
imagery
that
we
do
not
propose
to
attempt
any
investigation
of
their
meaning
in
this
article
it
is
our
object
to
influence
the
minds
of
such
protestants
as
believe
in
god
the
father
son
and
holy
spirit
and
of
catholics
whose
faith
is
so
dull
and
whose
charity
is
so
cold
that
they
can
listen
to
the
blasphemies
of
antichrist
without
emotion
we
may
remark
here
however
that
if
we
succeed
in
supplying
solid
reasons
for
believing
that
antichrist
is
already
amongst
us
and
that
his
dismal
career
of
desolating
victory
has
already
begun
the
duty
of
studying
those
utterances
of
the
holy
ghost
so
darkly
veiled
that
the
faith
of
those
who
stand
firm
may
have
more
merit
in
the
trial
of
that
great
tribulation
will
have
assumed
a
position
of
importance
impossible
to
be
overrated
that
they
are
to
be
understood
the
holy
ghost
himself
implies
he
intimates
that
their
meaning
is
accessible
to
the
spiritually
minded
and
would
even
seem
to
make
dulness
of
apprehension
of
it
a
reproach
a
lack
of
spiritual
discernment
any
one
has
the
ear
let
him
hear
he
writes
and
again
is
wisdom
let
him
who
has
understanding
reckon
the
number
of
the
it
is
not
necessary
to
the
object
we
have
in
view
that
we
should
identify
of
the
apocalypse
and
having
ten
horns
crowned
with
diadems
with
antichrist
the
question
we
propose
to
answer
is
simply
there
under
our
eyes
at
this
moment
evidences
of
a
present
antichrist
or
of
his
being
close
at
hand
in
other
words
what
is
called
spirit
of
the
the
spirit
of
antichrist
for
us
that
we
may
be
on
our
guard
against
his
wiles
and
armed
to
the
teeth
to
fight
against
him
to
the
death
it
is
comparatively
unimportant
whether
we
decide
him
to
be
actually
amongst
us
or
only
just
about
to
appear
his
marks
and
characteristics
his
badges
or
decorations
these
are
all
we
require
if
the
antichrist
of
the
prophecies
is
a
single
separate
impersonation
of
the
demoniac
attributes
described
by
the
holy
ghost
if
in
short
he
is
an
individual
man
then
he
has
not
yet
been
revealed
in
that
case
our
identification
of
antichrist
will
only
have
exposed
that
temper
and
spirit
with
which
red
ancient
has
possessed
such
vast
multitudes
of
the
human
race
throughout
the
entire
globe
as
to
afford
ground
for
calling
it
spirit
of
the
age
and
which
is
to
culminate
in
some
terrible
personal
embodiment
a
typical
personage
as
men
speak
but
if
the
prophecies
do
not
designate
an
individual
man
but
only
the
impersonation
of
a
multitude
of
individuals
organized
into
a
unity
and
animated
with
the
same
spirit
then
we
think
we
shall
be
able
to
point
the
finger
of
horror
and
loathing
at
the
very
antichrist
at
present
amongst
us
and
in
the
midst
of
victory
as
decisively
and
as
clearly
as
the
prophet
of
penance
pointed
the
finger
of
adoring
love
towards
the
lamb
of
god
we
incline
and
strongly
to
the
latter
view
we
must
withhold
our
reasons
partly
because
as
we
have
said
our
object
is
equally
subserved
by
either
view
but
more
because
to
do
so
would
leave
us
too
little
space
for
treating
the
main
subject
we
will
content
ourselves
with
stating
that
those
reasons
are
founded
on
the
internal
evidence
supplied
by
the
several
predictions
and
also
on
our
aversion
to
admit
the
possibility
of
a
more
depraved
impersonation
of
evil
than
that
unhappy
man
whom
god
in
human
flesh
pronounced
a
devil
whether
however
antichrist
be
or
not
an
individual
man
one
thing
is
certain
that
if
we
can
point
out
an
immense
army
of
men
with
the
globe
highly
organized
animated
with
the
same
spirit
and
acting
with
as
much
unity
of
purpose
as
if
their
movements
were
directed
by
one
head
who
exhibit
precisely
those
marks
and
characteristics
described
in
the
predictions
of
antichrist
we
may
expect
even
on
the
supposition
that
they
are
to
have
a
visible
head
an
individual
leader
who
has
yet
to
make
his
appearance
and
that
they
are
his
hosts
who
have
already
achieved
a
great
part
of
his
victories
what
is
first
noticeable
is
that
the
stigma
which
is
to
be
deeply
branded
on
the
front
of
the
antichristian
manifestation
which
is
to
precede
the
close
of
time
is
the
day
of
the
lord
will
not
come
venerit
discessio
primum
spiritus
dicit
quia
in
novissimis
temporibus
quidam
a
fide
there
can
be
no
need
of
dwelling
on
this
it
is
sufficiently
obvious
that
the
great
apostasy
inaugurated
by
luther
was
the
first
outbreak
of
antichristian
victory
the
success
of
that
movement
assured
the
spirit
of
error
of
a
career
of
victory
he
was
lurking
in
the
fold
watching
for
his
opportunity
and
snatching
away
stray
souls
as
john
tells
us
in
the
time
of
the
apostles
for
a
millennium
and
a
half
has
he
been
preparing
his
manifestation
he
inspired
julian
he
inspired
the
arians
he
inspired
all
the
heresies
against
which
the
definitions
of
the
faith
were
decreed
but
when
he
had
seduced
men
away
from
the
church
whole
nations
at
a
time
peter
ii
and
captivated
them
to
the
irrational
opinion
that
there
is
no
higher
authority
for
the
obligatory
dogmas
of
the
christian
church
than
the
conviction
of
every
individual
and
then
god
was
merely
a
matter
of
time
what
human
passion
had
begun
human
reason
would
complete
the
life
of
faith
could
not
be
annihilated
at
a
blow
it
has
taken
three
centuries
for
the
sap
of
charity
to
wither
away
in
the
branches
but
sooner
or
later
the
green
wood
could
not
but
become
dry
and
reason
void
of
charity
would
be
forced
to
acknowledge
that
if
the
bible
has
no
definite
meaning
other
than
what
appears
to
be
its
meaning
to
every
individual
practically
it
has
no
definite
meaning
at
all
that
god
can
not
have
revealed
any
truth
at
all
if
we
have
no
means
of
ascertaining
what
it
is
beyond
our
own
private
opinions
that
a
book
the
text
of
which
admits
of
as
many
interpretations
as
there
are
sects
can
not
without
an
authoritative
living
expositor
reveal
truths
which
it
is
necessary
to
believe
in
order
to
escape
eternal
punishment
the
claim
of
the
catholic
church
to
this
authority
having
been
pronounced
an
usurpation
the
progress
although
slow
was
sure
and
easy
towards
pronouncing
christianity
itself
an
usurpation
god
himself
can
not
survive
christianity
and
we
have
now
literally
to
so
triumphant
a
manifestation
of
antichrist
that
the
work
of
persecution
of
church
has
set
in
with
a
vengeance
and
men
hear
on
all
sides
of
them
the
existence
of
god
denied
without
horror
even
without
surprise
the
first
mark
of
a
present
antichrist
we
propose
to
signalize
is
that
distinctly
assigned
to
him
by
paul
ὁ
ἄνομος
this
epithet
is
but
feebly
rendered
by
the
latin
or
the
english
wicked
lawless
better
conveys
the
force
of
the
greek
for
the
root
νόμος
includes
in
its
meaning
not
only
enacted
law
of
all
kinds
but
whatever
has
become
as
it
were
a
law
by
custom
or
a
law
of
nature
as
it
were
by
the
universal
observance
of
mankind
the
first
marked
sequel
of
the
apostasy
the
first
outbreak
of
success
of
antichrist
in
the
political
order
was
the
first
french
revolution
during
which
a
harlot
was
placed
for
worship
upon
the
altar
of
notre
dame
that
fearful
outbreak
may
have
sat
for
its
portrait
to
peter
in
the
following
description
of
the
members
of
the
antichrist
of
the
walk
after
the
flesh
in
the
lust
of
concupiscence
and
despise
authority
irrational
beasts
following
only
their
own
brute
impulses
made
only
to
be
caught
and
slain
having
eyes
full
of
adultery
and
of
ceaseless
sin
speaking
proud
things
of
vanity
enticing
through
the
desires
of
the
luxury
of
the
flesh
those
who
by
degrees
go
away
from
the
truth
who
become
habituated
to
error
promising
them
liberty
whereas
they
themselves
are
the
slaves
of
pet
ii
that
saturnalia
of
lawlessness
which
freemason
writers
have
ever
since
dared
to
approve
was
the
work
of
the
of
freemasonry
to
whose
organization
and
plan
of
action
does
indeed
in
an
especial
sense
apply

thus
is
necessary
to
conduct
the
reader
to
the
opening
of
the
subterranean
mine
laid
at
that
time
beneath
thrones
and
altars
by
revolutionists
differing
greatly
both
in
their
theory
and
their
practice
from
the
encyclopedists
an
association
had
been
formed
of
men
of
every
land
every
religion
and
every
class
bound
together
by
mysterious
signs
agreed
upon
amongst
themselves
pledged
by
a
solemn
oath
to
observe
inviolable
secrecy
as
to
the
existence
of
this
hidden
bond
and
tested
by
proofs
of
a
terrible
thus
we
find
freemasonry
to
have
been
widely
diffused
immediately
before
the
outbreak
of
the
revolution
spreading
over
the
whole
face
of
europe
it
poisoned
the
thinking
minds
of
germany
and
secretly
stirred
up
rebellion
in
france
showing
itself
everywhere
in
the
light
of
an
association
resting
upon
principles
diametrically
opposed
to
those
which
govern
civil
the
ordinances
of
freemasonry
did
indeed
make
great
outward
display
of
obedience
to
law
of
respect
to
the
outward
forms
and
usages
of
profane
society
and
of
reverence
towards
rulers
at
their
banquets
the
masons
did
indeed
drink
the
health
of
kings
in
the
days
of
monarchy
and
of
presidents
in
the
time
of
republics
such
prudent
circumspection
being
indispensable
on
the
part
of
an
association
which
threatened
the
existence
of
the
very
governments
under
whose
eyes
it
was
compelled
to
work
and
whose
suspicion
it
had
already
aroused
this
nevertheless
did
not
suffice
to
counteract
the
radically
revolutionary
influence
continually
exercised
by
the
craft
even
while
it
professed
nothing
but
peaceful
in
the
work
from
which
the

apostle
declares

be

was
christ
born
than
his
infant
life
was
sought
no

did
he
begin

ancient
sought
his
ruin
just
before
the
triumph
of
his
resurrection
the
enemy
of
mankind
seemed
to
have
finally
and
completely
triumphed
in

crucifixion
no

her
work

no

a
serious
check
before
that
terrific
triumph
over

the

so
unmistakable
is
his

manifestation
that
it
is
woe
to
those

blink
their

follow

according

the

in
taking
a
survey
of
the
craft

freemasonry
what
first
seizes
our
attention
is
it
not
the
profound
darkness
in
which
all
its
operations
are
veiled
those
terrible
oaths
of

the

wander
amidst
our
adversaries
shrouded
in
threefold
darkness
their
passions
serve
as
wires
whereby
unknown
to
themselves
we
set
them
in
motion
and
compel
them
unwittingly
to
work
in
union
with
in
a
work
written
in
the
authorship
of
which
is
ascribed
to
a
hoffman
of
vienna
the
contents
of
which
are
supported
by
documentary
evidence
and
of
which
a
dutch
translation
was
published
in
amsterdam
in
which
was
reprinted
at
the
hague
in
the
method
of
working
of
this
of
is
thus
summed
up
to
effect
this
a
literary
association
must
be
formed
to
promote
the
circulation
of
our
writings
and
suppress
as
far
as
possible
those
of
our
opponents
for
this
end
we
must
contrive
to
have
in
our
pay
the
publishers
of
the
leading
literary
journals
of
the
day
in
order
that
they
may
turn
into
ridicule
and
heap
contempt
on
everything
written
in
a
contrary
interest
to
our
own
that
is
not
with
us
is
against
therefore
we
may
persecute
calumniate
and
tread
down
such
an
one
without
scruple
individuals
like
this
are
noxious
insects
which
one
shakes
from
the
blossoming
tree
and
crushes
beneath
foot
very
few
can
bear
to
be
made
to
look
ridiculous
let
ridicule
therefore
be
the
weapon
employed
against
persons
who
though
by
no
means
devoid
of
sense
show
themselves
hostile
to
our
schemes
in
order
the
more
quickly
to
attain
our
end
the
middle
classes
of
society
must
be
thoroughly
imbued
with
our
principles
the
lower
orders
and
the
mass
of
the
population
are
of
little
importance
as
they
may
easily
be
moulded
to
our
will
the
middle
classes
are
the
principal
supporters
of
the
government
to
gain
them
we
must
work
on
their
passions
and
above
all
bring
up
the
rising
generation
in
our
ideas
as
in
a
few
years
they
will
be
in
their
turn
masters
of
the
situation
license
in
morals
will
be
the
best
means
of
enabling
us
to
provide
ourselves
with
patrons
at
court
persons
who
are
nevertheless
totally
ignorant
of
the
importance
of
our
cause
it
will
suffice
for
our
purpose
if
we
make
them
absolutely
indifferent
to
the
christian
religion
they
are
for
the
most
part
careless
enough
without
us
if
our
aims
are
to
be
pursued
with
vigor
it
is
of
absolute
necessity
to
regard
as
enemies
of
enlightenment
and
of
philosophy
all
those
who
cling
in
any
way
to
religious
or
civil
prejudices
and
exhibit
this
attachment
in
their
writings
they
must
be
viewed
as
beings
whose
influence
is
highly
prejudicial
to
the
human
race
and
a
great
obstacle
to
its
and
progress
on
this
account
it
becomes
the
duty
of
each
one
of
us
to
impede
their
action
in
all
matters
of
consequence
and
to
seize
the
first
suitable
opportunity
which
may
present
itself
of
putting
them
entirely
du
we
must
ever
be
on
the
watch
to
make
all
changes
in
the
state
serve
our
own
ends
political
parties
cabals
brotherhoods
and
unions
in
short
everything
that
affords
an
opportunity
of
creating
disturbances
must
be
an
instrument
in
our
hands
for
it
is
only
on
the
ruins
of
society
as
it
exists
at
present
that
we
can
hope
to
erect
a
solid
structure
on
the
natural
system
and
ensure
to
the
worshippers
of
nature
the
free
exercise
of
their
if
this
method
of
working
is
not
adventum
we
should
be
glad
to
know
what
is
herein
we
find
every
feature
of
antichrist
and
his
hosts
which
the
holy
ghost
has
drawn
for
our
warning
they
are
heaped
together
in
such
hideous
combination
throughout
this
summary
as
scarcely
to
need
particularizing
our
readers
may
not
however
be
unwilling
that
we
should
single
them
out
one
by
one
as
they
appear
more
or
less
prominently
in
the
several
paragraphs
premising
that
throughout
one
characteristic
reigns
and
prevails
and
indeed
lends
its
color
to
all
the
rest
that
special
attribute
of
father
of
falsehood
we
will
take
the
paragraphs
in
order
and
photograph

most
prominent
antichristian
features

that

are

repulsive
infirmities
of
individuals
but
the
essential
and
inevitable
characteristics
deliberately
adopted
by
the
craft
of
freemasons
and
which
it
can
not
be
without
if
they
are
the
brand
which
the
finger
of
god
has
marked
upon
the
loathsome
brow
of
the
antichrist

in

of
the
former
of

quote
the
words
of
brother
gotthold
salomon
preacher
at

at
hamburg
member
of
the
lodge
entitled
dawn
in

in
who
thus
writes
in
his
aus
mss
for
the
brethren
is
there
not
a
trace
of
anything
appertaining
to
the
christian
church
to
be
found
in
the
whole
ritual
of
freemasonry
why
is
not
the
name
of
jesus
once
mentioned
either
in
the
oath
administered
or
in
the
prayers
on
the
opening
of
the
lodges
or
at
the
masonic
banquets
why
do
masons
reckon
time
not
from
the
birth
of
christ
but
from
the
creation
of
the
world
as
do
the
jews
why
does
not
freemasonry
make
use
of
a
single
christian
symbol
why
have
we
the
compasses
the
triangle
the
hydrometer
instead
of
the
cross
and
other
emblems
of
the
passion
why
have
wisdom
beauty
and
strength
superseded

christian
triad
of

and
charity

we
find
the
following

the
contemptible
inventions
of
petty

on
deceiving

they
are

most

human

palmed
off

by
drechsler
in
vol
iv
of

too
plainly
that
all

result

human
reason

aware
of
the
irreconcilable
enmity
existing
between
its
own
teachings

the

from

by
the

of

the
greater
glory
of
the
supreme
architect
of

in
the

of
we
quote
the
following
that
at
the
head
of
every
document
issued
by
the
brethren
in
an
individual
or
corporate
capacity
should
stand
a
profession
of
faith
in
our
lawgiver
jesus
the
son
of
mary
amram
the
josue
of
the
old
testament
the
invariable
formula
to
be
employed
being
the
glory
of
the
great
architect
of
the
universe
to
expose
and
oppose
the
errors
of
pope
and
priest
who
commence
everything
in
the
name
of
their
trinity

remembrance
of
the
last
supper
or
christian
of
jesus
the
son
of
mary
amram
an
account
of
which
is
given
in
the
arabic
traditions
and
in
the
koran
a
solemn
festival
should
be
held
accompanied
by
a
distribution
of
bread
in
commemoration
of
an
ancient
custom
observed
by
the
slaves
of
eating
bread
together
and
of
their
deliverance
by
means
of
the
liberator
josue
the
distribution
is
to
be
accompanied
by
these
memorable
words
is
the
bread
of
misery
and
oppression
which
our
fathers
were
forced
to
eat
under
the
pharaos
the
priests
of
juda
whosoever
hungers
let
him
come
and
eat
this
is
the
paschal
sacrifice
come
unto
us
all
you
who
are
oppressed
yet
this
one
year
more
in
babylon
and
the
next
year
shall
see
us
free
men
this
instructive
and
at
the
same
time
commemorative
supper
of
the
rosicrucians
is
the
counterpart
of
the
supper
of
the
dupuy
indeed
informs
us
of
the
corrupt
portion
of
the
order
of
templars
that
dicebant
illis
quos
recipiebant
christum
non
esse
verum
deum
et
ipsum
fuisse
falsum
non
fuisse

redemptione
humani
generis
sed
pro
sceleribus
who
received
said
to
those
whom
they
received
that
christ
was
not
really
god
that
he
was
himself
false
and
did
not
suffer
for
the
redemption
of
the
human
race
but
for
his
own
in
harmony
with
all
this
was
the
offensively
blasphemous
utterance
of
frothingham
at
the
masonic
hall
in
this
city
some
weeks
ago
at
which
the
new
york
expressed
a
just
indignation
an
indignation
which
must
have
been
shared
by
all
who
believe
in
any
way
or
form
in
jesus
christ
redeemer
of
the
world
paine
has
keyed
my
moral
being
up
to
a
higher
note
than
the
jesus
of
the
argument
we
have
advanced
seems
to
us
to
be
convincing
enough
as
it
stands
could
we
have
taken
a
historical
survey
of
the
μυστήριον
τῆς
ανομίας
in
the
two
hemispheres
from
the
up
to
the
present
time
but
especially
during
the
last
fifteen
years
it
would
have
acquired
the
force
of
a
logical
demonstration
the
limits
to
which
we
are
necessarily
restrained
in
a
monthly
periodical
put
this
completely
out
of
our
power
whoever
he
may
be
who
has
intelligently
appreciated
the
political
events
of
the
latter
period
will
be
able
to
supply
the
deficiency
for
himself
merely
hinting
therefore
at
the
impossibility
of
getting
appreciations
of
contemporary
events
before
the
public
well
known
to
all
whose
position
has
invited
them
to
that
duty
as
an
illustration
of
the
plan
of
action
laid
down
in
the
second
clause
of
the
above
summary
at
the
recent
unconcealed
advocacy
of
the
by
the
new

and
the
more
cautious
conversion
of
the
london
times
of
that
in
the
third
at
the
ribaldry
of
the
press
under
freemason
influence
directed
against
the
bishops
clergy
and
prominent
laymen
as
well
as
against
the
pope
the
nicknames
they
are
for
ever
coining
such
as
their
blasphemous
travesties
of
the
solemnities
of
religion
in
theatres
and
places
of
public
resort
and
so
on
of
that
in
the
fourth

the
effort
to
induce

to
exclude

the

recent

the
whole

strewn
with
the
wreck
of

that
of

ninth

pass
on
to
the
last
two
marks

himself
above
all

that
he
may
sit
in
the
temple
of

himself
out

it
were

barruel
who
was
completely
versed
in
freemasonry
and
who
had
been
himself
a
mason
states
that
grade
of
kadosch
is
the
soul
of
freemasonry
and
the
final
object
of
its
plots
is
the
reintroduction
of
absolute
liberty
and
equality
through
the
destruction
of
all
royalty
and
the
abrogation
of
all
religious

backs
this
statement
by
a
tragic
incident
in
the
history
of
a
friend
of
his
who
because
he
was
a
rosicrucian
fancied
himself
to
be
possession
of
the
entire
secret
of
it
is
too
long
to
admit
of
our
quoting
it

of
pp
a
new
york
paper
in
the
interests
of
freemasonry
about
the
year
had
the
following
far
as
religion
is
concerned
the
has
none
at
all
he
protests
against
every
creed
he
is
an
atheist
and
materialist
openly
denying
the
existence
of
god
and
of
the
in
belief
in
god
was
a
crime
prohibited
in
france
under
pain
of
death
those
of
our
readers
who
have
some
acquaintance
with
modern
philosophy
we
need
here
only
remind
of
the
and
of
spinoza
born
a
jew
but
expelled
from
the
synagogue
for
his
advocacy
of
these
principles
of
freemasonry
desire
to
find
truth
is
a
noble
impulse
the
search
after
it
a
sacred
avocation
and
ample
field
for
this
is
offered
by
both
the
mysterious
rites
peculiar
to
the
craft
and
those
of
the
goddess
isis
adored
in
our
temples
as
the
wisest
and
fairest
of
year
no

in
the
a
french
organ
of
freemasonry
was
the
following
passage
a
few
weeks
ago
is
nothing
but
a
creation
of
the
human
mind
in
a
word
god
is
the
ideal
if
i
am
accused
of
being
an
atheist
i
should
reply
i
prefer
to
be
an
atheist
and
have
of
god
an
idea
worthy
of
him
to
being
a
spiritualist
and
make
of
god
a
being
impossible
and
in
short
the
craft
is
so
far
advanced
in
its
course
of
triumph
as
to
have
at
length
succeeded
in
familiarizing
the
public
ear
with
the
denial
of
the
existence
of
a
god
so
that
it
is
now
admitted
as
one
amongst
the
of
philosophy
our
illustration
of
the
crowning
indications
of
the
satanic
mark
of
antichrist
afforded
by
the
freemasons
the
sitting
in
the
temple
of
god
so
as
to
make
himself
out
to
be
as
it
were
god
will
be
short
but
decisive
the
passage
in
the
last
work
of
the
late
strauss
to
the
effect
that
any
worship
paid
to
a
supposed
divine
being
is
an
outrage
on
dignity
of
human
goes
far
enough
we
should
have
thought
in
this
direction
but
they
go
beyond
even
this

says
spirit
which
animates
us
is
an
eternal
spirit
it
knows
no
division
of
time
or
individual
existence
a
sacred
unity
pervades
the
wide
firmament
of
heaven
it
is
our
one
calling
our
one
duty
our
one
god
yes
we
are
god
we
ourselves
are
god
in
the
periodical
circulation
amongst
the
altenberg
vol
no
is
the
following
idea
of
religion
indirectly
includes
all
men
as
men
but
in
order
to
comprehend
this
aright
a
certain
degree
of
education
is
necessary
and
unfortunately
the
overweening
egoism
of
the
educated
classes
prevents
their
taking
in
so
sublime
a
conception
of
mankind
for
this
reason
our
temples
consecrated
to
the
of
can
as
yet
be
opened
only
to
a
few
we
should
indeed
expose
ourselves
to
a
charge
of
idolatry
were
we
to
attempt
to
personify
the
moral
idea
of
humanity
in
the
way
in
which
divinity
is
usually
on
this
account
therefore
it
is
advisable
not
to
reveal
the
cultus
of
humanity
to
the
eyes
of
the
uninitiated
until
at
length
the
time
shall
come
when
from
east
to
west
this
lofty
conception
of
humanity
shall
find
a
place
in
every
breast
this
worship
shall
alone
prevail
and
all
mankind
shall
be
gathered
into
one
fold
and
one
the
principles
of
this
united
family
in
the
temple
of
god
the
masonic
philosopher
helvetius
expounds
to
us
from
whom
we
learn
that
is
beneficial
to
all
in
general
may
be
called
virtue
what
is
prejudicial
vice
and

here
the
voice
of
interest
has

are
only
the
intensified
expression
of
in
the
individual

the
dutch
people
who
when
hatred
and
revenge
urged
them
to
action
achieved
great
triumphs
and
made
their
country
a
powerful
and
glorious
name
and
as
sensual
love
is
universally
acknowledged
to
afford

must
be
condemned
as
pernicious

hesitate
to
point
out
the
consummation
above
anticipated
we
are
bid
to
expect
nor
is
it
now
far
off
they
who

however
the
consoling
assurance
that

him
with

of

of
his
sir
thomas

the
french
of

said
wolsey
to
one
of
his
secretaries
in
whom
he
placed
the
greatest
confidence
soon
as
you
see
him
present
yourself
before
him
give
the
usual
password
and
then
conduct
him
through
the
subterranean
passage
that
leads
to
the
banks
of
the
thames
bring
him
here
by
the
secret
stairway
he
will
be
dressed
in
a
cloak
and
suit
of
brown
clothes
wearing
a
black
felt
hat
tied
round
with
a
red
lord
you
may
feel
perfectly
satisfied
replied
the
secretary
with
a
air
all
your
orders
will
be
punctually
executed
but
he
can
not
possibly
arrive
for
an
hour
yet
i
will
vouch
for
that
my
however
sir
replied
the
minister
impatiently
fear
being
taken
by
surprise
have
less
confidence
in
your
own
calculations
sir
and
be
more
prompt
in
your
and
saying
this
he
made
a
sign
for
him
to
go
at
once
the
door
had
scarcely
closed
on
soria
when
the
cardinal
who
sat
writing
in
silence
heard
in
the
court
of
the
palace
an
unusual
noise
for
some
time
he
continued
his
work
but
the
tumult
increasing
and
hearing
loud
bursts
of
laughter
he
arose
opened
the
window
and
went
out
on
a
high
balcony
whence
he
had
a
view
of
all
that
was
passing
in
the
principal
court
there
a
crowd
of
servants
had
assembled
and
formed
a
circle
around
an
old
woman
who
was
apparently
the
object
of
their
ridicule
her
large
felt
hat
around
which
was
tied
a
band
of
red
ribbon
had
fallen
to
the
ground
leaving
uncovered
not
the
head
of
an
old
woman
as
they
had
supposed
but
one
thickly
covered
with
short
hair
black
and
curling
on
seeing
this
the
crowd
redoubled
their
cries
and
one
of
them
advancing
suddenly
raised
the
mask
concealing
the
features
what
was
their
surprise
to
find
under
that
disguise
a
great
rubicund
face
the
nose
and
cheeks
of
which
were
reddened
with
the
glow
that
wine
and
strong
drink
alone
produce
and
giving
sufficient
evidence
of
the
sex
to
which
it
belonged
the
man
seeing
he
was
discovered
defended
himself
with
vigor
and
dealing
sharp
blows
with
his
feet
and
hands
endeavored
to
escape
from
his
tormentors
but
he
was
unable
to
resist
their
superior
numbers
they
threw
themselves
upon
him
tearing
off
his
brown
cloak
and
one
of
his
blue
cotton
petticoats
the
wretched
creature
cried
out
vociferously
loudly
threatening
them
with
the
indignation
of
the
cardinal
but
the
valets
heard
nothing
vain
were
all
his
efforts
to
escape
them
nevertheless
being
exceedingly
robust
he
at
length
succeeded
in
overthrowing
two
of
his
antagonists
and
then
dashing
across
the
courtyard
he
sprang
quickly
into
the
second
court
where
finding
a
ladder
placed
at
the
window
of
a
granary
he
clambered
up
with
all
the
dexterity
of
a
frightened
cat
and
hid
himself
under
a
quantity
of
straw
which
had
been
stored
there
in
the
meantime
the
cardinal
had
recognized
from
his
elevated
position
on
the
balcony
the
red
ribbon
that
announced
the
messenger
for
whom
he
awaited
with
so
much
anxiety
greatly
enraged
at
the
scene
before
him
and
forgetting
his
dignity
he
hurried
from
the
balcony
rushing
through
the
apartments
that
led
from
his
own
room
in
which
were
seated
the
numerous
secretaries
of
state
engaged
in
the
work
of
the
government
without
addressing
a
word
to
them
he
descended
the
stairs
so
rapidly
that
in
another
instant
he
stood
in
the
midst
of
his
servants
who
were
stupefied
at
finding
themselves
in
the
presence
of
their
master
all
out
of
breath
bareheaded
and
almost
suffocated
with
indignation
he
commanded
them
in
the
most
emphatic
terms
to
get
out
of
his
sight
which
they
did
without
waiting
for
a
repetition
of
the
order
from
every
direction
the
pages
and
secretaries
had
assembled
among
them
being
de
soria
who
was
in
great
trepidation
fearing
some
accident
had
happened
to
the
individual
whom
he
had
been
instructed
to
introduce
with
such
great
secrecy
into
the
palace
his
fears
were
more
than
realized
on
seeing
the
cardinal
who
cast
on
him
a
glance
of
intense
anger
and
in
a
loud
voice
exclaimed
sir
to
the
assistance
of
this
unfortunate
man
who
is
being
subjected
to
such
outrages
in
my
own
house
not
a
few
of
those
who
have
attempted
to
drive
him
off
shall
themselves
be
sent
away
then
the
cardinal
giving
an
authoritative
signal
those
around
him
understood
that
their
presence
was
no
longer
desired
and
immediately
ascended
the
stairs
and
returned
to
their
work
wolsey
himself
quickly
followed
them
and
de
soria
greatly
confused
in
a
short
time
appeared
and
ushered
into
the
cabinet
the
messenger
who
was
still
suffering
from
the
effects
of
the
contest
in
which
he
had
been
compelled
to
engage
letters
your
letters
said
wolsey
eagerly
as
soon
as
they
were
alone
is
right
wilson
i
am
satisfied
i
see
that
you
are
no
coward
and
all
that
you
have
just
now
suffered
will
be
turned
to
your
advantage
nevertheless
it
is
quite
fortunate
that
i
came
to
your
rescue
when
i
did
for
i
really
do
not
know
what
those
knaves
might
have
done
to
would
have
thrown
me
into
the
water
i
believe
like
a
dog
said
wilson
laughing
that
was
nothing
though
i
have
been
through
worse
than
that
in
my
life
all
i
was
afraid
of
was
that
they
might
discover
the
package
of
letters
and
the
as
he
said
this
the
courier
proceeded
to
unfasten
the
buckles
of
an
undervest
made
of
chamois
leather
that
he
wore
closely
strapped
around
his
body
after
he
had
taken
off
the
vest
he
unfastened
a
number
of
bands
of
woollen
cloth
which
were
crossed
on
his
breast
in
each
one
of
these
bands
was
folded
a
great
number
of
letters
of
different
forms
and
sizes
then
he
unstrapped
from
his
waist
and
laid
on
the
table
a
belt
that
contained
quite
a
large
sum
of
money
in
gold
coin
that
francis
had
sent
to
the
minister
the
avarice
of
wolsey
was
so
well
understood
by
the
different
princes
and
sovereigns
of
europe
that
they
were
accustomed
to
send
him
valuable
presents
or
to
confer
on
him
rich
annuities
whenever
they
wished
to
gain
him
over
to
their
interests
wolsey
had
for
a
long
time
been
engaged
in
a
correspondence
with
france
he
carried
it
on
with
the
utmost
secrecy
for
he
well
understood
if
discovered
by
henry
he
would
never
be
pardoned
his
apprehensions
were
still
greater
now
that
he
was
endeavoring
to
direct
the
influence
of
his
political
schemes
and
that
of
the
paid
agents
whom
he
had
at
the
different
courts
of
europe
towards
bringing
about
a
reconciliation
between
the
emperor
charles
and
the
king
of
france
hoping
by
such
an
alliance
to
prevent
the
marriage
of
the
king
with
anne
boleyn
and
thus
to
destroy
the
hopes
of
that
ambitious
family
he
saw
with
intense
satisfaction
his
intrigues
succeeding
far
beyond
his
most
sanguine
expectations
francis
anxiously
entreated
him
to
use
his
influence
with
the
king
of
england
in
order
to
dispose
him
favorably
toward
the
treaty
of
peace
which
he
was
determined
to
make
with
charles
assure
you
he
wrote
i
have
so
great
a
desire
to
see
my
children
held
so
long
now
as
hostages
that
i
would
without
hesitation
willingly
give
the
half
of
my
kingdom
to
ensure
that
happiness
if
you
will
aid
me
in
removing
the
obstacles
that
henry
may
interpose
to
the
accomplishment
of
this
purpose
you
may
count
on
my
gratitude
the
place
of
meeting
is
already
arranged
we
have
chosen
the
city
of
cambrai
and
i
have
felt
great
pleasure
in
the
assurance
that
you
prefer
above
all
other
places
that
the
conference
should
be
held
in
that
charmed
with
his
success
the
cardinal
sent
immediately
in
quest
of
cromwell
whom
he
found
every
day
becoming
more
and
more
indispensable
to
him
and
to
whom
he
wished
to
communicate
the
happiness
he
experienced
in
receiving
this
joyful
intelligence
but
at
the
same
time
closely
concealing
the
manner
in
which
he
had
obtained
the
information
on
a
terrace
of
windsor
castle
a
tent
had
been
erected
of
heavy
persian
cloth
interwoven
with
silk
and
gold
voluminous
curtains
of
royal
purple
artistically
looped
on
each
side
with
heavy
silk
cords
descended
in
innumerable
folds
of
most
graceful
drapery
rare
flowers
embalmed
the
air
in
every
direction
with
exquisite
perfumes
which
penetrated
into
an
apartment
of
the
royal
palace
through
the
open
windows
of
which
were
seen
the
richness
and
elegance
of
the
interior
in
this
apartment
were
seated
three
persons
apparently
engaged
in
an
animated
conversation
there
is
yet
another
difficulty
cried
a
young
girl
a
charming
and
beautiful
blonde
who
seemed
at
this
moment
in
an
extremely
impatient
and
excited
mood
what
say
you
she
added
presently
addressing
herself
with
vivacity
to
a
gentleman
seated
immediately
in
front
of
her
now
sir
cromwell
say
what
would
you
do
in
this
desperate
situation
is
there
no
way
in
which
we
can
prevent
this
treaty
from
being
concluded
truly
madam
he
replied
will
be
useless
to
attempt
it
the
duchess
of
angoulême
has
at
this
moment
perhaps
already
arrived
at
cambrai
for
the
purpose
of
signing
the
treaty
and
we
can
not
reasonably
hope
that
the
archduchess
margaret
who
accompanies
her
will
not
agree
with
her
on
every
point
since
the
preliminaries
have
already
been
secretly
concluded
between
the
emperor
and
the
king
of
my
dear
cromwell
she
replied
in
a
familiar
and
angry
tone
shall
we
do
then
i
have
any
counsel
to
give
you
madam
answered
cromwell
with
an
air
of
importance
is
to
begin
by
preventing
the
king
from
consenting
to
the
departure
of
cardinal
wolsey
because
his
greatest
desire
now
is
to
be
sent
as
envoy
to
the
congress
at
cambrai
and
you
may
be
well
assured
if
he
wishes
to
go
there
it
is
certainly
not
with
the
intention
of
being
useful
to
you
but
on
the
contrary
to
injure
you
think
so
replied
lady
anne
i
shall
most
certainly
endeavor
to
prevent
him
from
making
his
appearance
there
but
has
he
told
you
nothing
about
the
letter
i
wrote
him
the
other
day
me
madam
replied
cromwell
has
shown
me
the
letter
in
fact
he
conceals
nothing
from
and
did
it
not
give
him
pleasure
it
seemed
to
me
it
ought
to
please
him
for
i
made
protestations
of
friendship
sufficient
to
reassure
him
and
remove
all
apprehensions
he
may
have
felt
that
i
would
injure
him
in
the
estimation
of
the
has
said
nothing
to
me
on
the
subject
replied
cromwell
i
remarked
that
he
read
the
letter
over
several
times
and
when
he
handed
it
to
me
it
was
with
a
very
ominous
shake
of
the
head
understanding
so
well
his
every
gesture
and
thought
i
comprehended
perfectly
he
was
but
little
convinced
of
what
you
had
written
and
that
he
has
no
confidence
in
it
moreover
madam
it
is
necessary
that
you
should
know
that
wolsey
has
been
most
active
in
his
endeavors
to
forward
the
divorce
so
long
as
he
believed
the
king
would
espouse
a
princess
of
the
house
of
france
but
since
he
knows
it
is
he
has
chosen
his
mind
is
entirely
changed
and
he
tries
in
every
possible
manner
to
retard
the
decision
and
render
success
is
clear
as
day
my
dear
sister
exclaimed
lord
rochford
earnestly
interrupting
cromwell
know
nothing
about
the
affairs
you
are
trying
to
manage
therefore
you
will
never
be
able
to
rid
yourself
of
this
imperious
minister
i
have
already
told
you
that
all
your
efforts
to
flatter
or
appease
him
will
be
in
vain
he
believes
you
fear
him
and
he
likes
you
no
better
on
that
account
what
cromwell
says
is
but
too
true
and
is
verified
by
the
fact
that
nothing
advances
in
this
affair
every
day
some
new
formalities
are
introduced
or
advantages
claimed
or
they
wait
for
new
instructions
and
powers
they
tell
us
constantly
that
campeggio
is
inflexible
that
nothing
will
induce
him
to
deviate
from
his
instructions
and
the
usages
of
the
court
of
rome
but
whom
has
he
chosen
with
whom
has
he
conferred
is
it
not
wolsey
and
he
has
certainly
prevented
us
from
obtaining
anything
but
what
he
himself
designed
to
are
right
brother
cried
anne
boleyn
with
a
sudden
gesture
of
displeasure
is
necessary
to
have
this
haughty
and
jealous
minister
removed
henceforth
all
my
efforts
shall
be
directed
to
this
end
it
may
perhaps
be
less
difficult
than
we
suppose
the
king
has
been
violently
opposed
to
this
treaty
which
wolsey
has
so
earnestly
labored
to
bring
about
or
at
least
the
king
suspects
him
of
it
and
he
told
me
yesterday
that
it
was
vain
for
the
king
of
france
to
address
him
as
good
brother
and
perpetual
ally
for
he
regarded
as
enemies
all
who
presumed
to
oppose
his
will
he
added
understand
very
well
beforehand
what
their
terms
will
be
once
become
the
ally
of
charles
francis
will
use
all
his
efforts
to
prevent
the
repudiation
of
his
aunt
but
nothing
under
heaven
shall
divert
me
from
my
purpose
i
will
resist
all
the
counsels
he
may
give
me
is
much
disappointed
said
lord
rochford
the
pope
should
have
been
raised
as
it
were
from
the
dead
his
death
would
have
greatly
lessened
these
difficulties
for
he
holds
firmly
to
his
opinions
i
am
much
deceived
or
the
commission
of
legates
will
pass
all
their
time
and
a
very
long
time
too
without
coming
to
any
as
lord
rochford
made
this
remark
his
wife
the
of
anne
boleyn
entered
the
apartment
accompanied
by
the
young
wife
of
lord
dacre
now
as
lady
rochford
belonged
entirely
to
the
adherents
and
lady
anne
was
very
much
in
fear
of
her
the
tone
of
conversation
was
immediately
changed
becoming
at
once
general
and
indifferent
bishop
of
rochester
has
returned
to
london
carelessly
remarked
anne
boleyn
as
she
stooped
to
pick
up
a
little
embroidered
glove
madam
replied
cromwell
have
seen
him
and
i
find
him
looking
quite
old
and
i
am
truly
sorry
to
hear
it
replied
lady
anne
king
is
very
much
attached
to
him
i
have
often
heard
him
say
he
regarded
him
as
the
most
learned
and
remarkable
man
in
england
and
that
he
congratulated
himself
on
possessing
in
his
kingdom
a
prelate
so
wise
virtuous
and
would
you
wish
madam
replied
cromwell
who
never
could
suffer
any
one
to
be
eulogized
in
his
presence
these
old
men
should
give
place
to
us
it
is
but
just
they
have
had
their
sir
cromwell
replied
lady
boleyn
smiling
have
no
desire
i
am
sure
to
be
made
bishop
therefore
the
place
he
will
leave
vacant
will
not
be
the
one
for
have
decided
that
question
very
hastily
madam
who
knows
i
may
one
day
perhaps
be
a
curate
it
has
been
predicted
of
that
would
indeed
be
a
very
strange
sight
she
replied
laughing
aloud
certainly
have
neither
the
turn
nor
the
taste
for
the
office
how
would
you
ever
manage
to
leave
off
the
habit
of
frequenting
our
truly
we
could
not
afford
to
lose
you
and
would
certainly
get
up
a
general
revolt
opposing
your
ordination
rather
than
be
deprived
of
your
invaluable
are
very
kind
madam
said
cromwell
i
should
perhaps
not
be
so
ridiculous
as
you
imagine
i
should
wear
a
grave
and
severe
countenance
and
an
air
of
the
greatest
i
understand
you
now
she
replied
would
not
be
converted
you
would
only
become
a
hypocrite
have
a
horror
of
hypocrites
said
cromwell
scornfully
wonder
what
you
are
then
thought
lady
rochford
i
also
replied
lady
anne
have
a
perfect
detestation
of
hypocrites
it
is
better
to
be
bad
out
and
out
it
true
there
has
been
a
riot
in
the
city
asked
lady
rochford
madam
replied
cromwell
it
was
suppressed
on
the
spot
it
was
only
a
hundred
carders
and
drapers
who
declared
they
were
no
longer
able
to
live
since
the
market
of
the
netherlands
has
been
closed
and
that
they
would
soon
starve
if
their
old
communications
were
not
the
most
mutinous
were
arrested
the
others
were
frightened
and
quickly
said
lord
rochford
is
nothing
to
fear
from
such
a
rabble
as
that
they
are
too
much
afraid
of
their
necks
let
them
clamor
and
let
us
give
ourselves
no
uneasiness
on
the
subject
i
met
sir
thomas
more
this
morning
going
to
the
king
with
a
petition
which
they
had
addressed
to
him
was
he
charged
with
the
commission
asked
young
lady
dacre
virtue
of
his
office
as
sheriff
of
the
city
replied
cromwell
constitutes
then
part
of
our
city
council
she
replied
is
a
man
i
have
the
greatest
desire
to
know
they
say
such
marvellous
things
of
him
and
i
find
his
poetry
full
of
charming
and
noble
see
replied
cromwell
have
not
read
the
spirited
satire
just
written
by
germain
de
brie
it
points
out
the
perfectly
prodigious
faults
of
productions
it
is
certainly
an
am
inclined
to
think
your
opinion
is
prompted
by
a
spirit
of
jealousy
sir
cromwell
answered
lady
rochford
sharply
madam
she
continued
addressing
young
lady
sophia
dacre
of
richard
i
suppose
sir
cromwell
will
at
least
accord
some
merit
to
that
work
too
light
and
superficial
indeed
madam
said
cromwell
author
has
confined
himself
wholly
to
a
recital
of
the
crimes
which
conducted
the
prince
to
the
throne
the
style
of
that
history
is
very
negligent
but
at
the
same
time
very
far
above
that
of
his
other
works
and
particularly
of
his
which
is
a
work
so
extravagant
a
political
system
so
impracticable
that
i
regard
the
book
simply
as
a
wonderful
fable
agreeable
enough
to
listen
to
but
at
which
one
is
obliged
to
laugh
afterwards
when
thinking
of
the
absurdities
it
judgment
is
as
invidious
as
it
is
false
exclaimed
lady
rochford
who
always
expressed
her
opinions
bluntly
and
without
dissimulation
it
is
true
she
continued
this
philosophical
dream
can
never
be
realized
yet
it
is
nevertheless
impossible
not
to
admire
the
wise
and
virtuous
maxims
it
contains
above
all
others
there
is
one
i
have
found
so
just
and
so
beautifully
conceived
i
could
wish
every
young
girl
capable
of
teaching
it
to
her
future
husband
can
it
be
supposed
says
the
author
any
man
of
honor
and
refinement
could
resolve
to
abandon
a
virtuous
woman
who
had
been
the
companion
of
his
bosom
and
in
whose
society
he
had
passed
so
many
days
of
happiness
only
because
time
at
whose
touch
all
things
fade
had
laid
his
destroying
hand
upon
the
lovely
features
of
that
gentle
wife
once
so
cherished
and
adored
because
age
which
has
been
the
first
and
most
incurable
of
all
the
infirmities
she
has
been
compelled
to
drag
after
her
had
forcibly
despoiled
her
of
the
charming
freshness
of
her
youth
has
that
husband
not
enjoyed
the
flower
of
her
beauty
and
garnered
in
the
most
beautiful
days
of
her
life
and
will
he
forsake
his
wife
now
because
she
has
become
feeble
delicate
and
suffering
shall
he
become
inconstant
and
perjured
at
the
very
moment
when
her
sad
condition
demands
of
him
a
thousand
sacrifices
and
claims
a
return
to
the
faithful
devotion
and
vows
of
his
early
youth
ah
into
such
a
depth
of
unworthiness
and
degradation
we
will
not
presume
it
possible
for
any
man
to
descend
it
was
thus
the
people
of
the
utopian
isle
reasoned
declaring
it
would
be
the
height
of
injustice
and
barbarity
to
abandon
one
whom
we
had
loved
and
cherished
and
who
had
been
so
devoted
to
us
at
the
moment
when
suffering
and
affliction
demanded
of
us
renewed
sympathy
and
a
generous
increase
of
our
tenderest
care
and
consolations
and
now
my
dear
sister
she
added
fixing
her
eyes
steadfastly
on
lady
boleyn
do
you
think
of
that
passage
are
you
not
forcibly
struck
by
the
truth
and
justice
of
the
sentiment
let
me
advise
you
when
you
marry
to
be
well
satisfied
beforehand
that
your
husband
entertains
the
same
as
she
heard
these
last
words
the
beautiful
face
of
anne
boleyn
became
suddenly
suffused
with
a
deep
crimson
and
for
some
moments
not
a
word
was
uttered
by
any
one
around
her
they
understood
perfectly
well
that
lady
remarks
were
intended
to
condemn
in
the
most
pointed
manner
the
conduct
towards
the
queen
whose
failing
health
was
entirely
attributable
to
the
mortification
and
suffering
she
endured
on
account
of
her
ingratitude
and
in
the
meantime
the
silence
becoming
every
moment
more
and
more
embarrassing
anne
boleyn
forcibly
assuming
an
air
of
gayety
declared
her
sister
was
disposed
to
look
very
far
into
the
future
she
added
my
dear
sister
neither
you
nor
i
are
in
a
condition
to
demand
all
those
tender
cares
due
to
age
and
ladies
let
us
go
said
cromwell
in
a
jesting
tone
hoping
to
render
himself
agreeable
to
lady
anne
by
relieving
the
embarrassment
the
conversation
had
caused
her
am
unable
to
express
my
admiration
for
lady
rochford
she
understands
too
well
the
practice
of
the
utopian
laws
not
to
wish
for
the
position
of
dean
of
the
doctors
of
the
university
of
are
very
complimentary
and
jocose
sir
replied
lady
rochford
if
you
wish
it
i
will
introduce
you
to
one
who
will
be
personally
necessary
if
you
should
ever
aspire
to
fill
a
position
in
that
kingdom
you
must
know
however
that
their
wise
utopia
while
he
accorded
to
each
one
liberty
of
conscience
confined
that
liberty
within
legitimate
and
righteous
bounds
in
order
to
prevent
the
promulgation
of
the
pernicious
doctrines
of
pretended
philosophers
who
endeavor
to
debase
the
dignity
of
our
exalted
human
nature
he
also
severely
condemned
every
opinion
tending
to
degenerate
into
pure
materialism
or
what
is
more
deplorable
still
veritable
atheism
the
utopians
were
taught
to
believe
in
the
reality
of
a
future
state
and
in
future
rewards
and
punishments
they
detested
and
denounced
all
who
presumed
to
deny
these
truths
and
far
from
admitting
them
to
the
rank
of
citizens
they
refused
even
to
class
among
men
those
who
debased
themselves
to
the
abject
condition
of
vile
animals
they
asked
be
done
with
a
creature
devoid
of
principle
and
without
faith
whose
only
restraint
is
fear
of
punishment
who
without
that
fear
would
violate
every
law
and
trample
under
foot
those
wise
rules
and
regulations
which
alone
constitute
the
bulwark
of
social
order
and
happiness
what
confidence
can
be
reposed
in
an
individual
purely
sensual
living
without
morals
and
without
hope
recognizing
no
obligation
but
to
himself
alone
who
limits
his
happiness
to
the
present
moment
whose
god
is
his
body
whose
law
his
own
pleasures
and
passions
in
the
gratification
of
which
he
is
at
all
times
ready
to
proceed
to
the
extremity
of
crime
provided
he
can
find
means
of
escaping
the
vigilant
eye
of
justice
and
be
a
villain
with
impunity
such
infamous
characters
are
of
course
excluded
from
all
participation
in
municipal
affairs
and
all
positions
of
honor
and
public
trust
they
are
veritable
automatons
abandoned
to
the
of
their
ways
wretched
wandering
of
the
on
which
they
live
you
perceive
sir
cromwell
continued
lady
rochford
ironically
my
profound
knowledge
and
retentive
memory
may
prove
very
useful
to
you
should
you
ever
arrive
at
the
utopian
isle
for
you
must
be
convinced
that
your
own
opinions
would
meet
with
very
little
favor
in
that
cromwell
humiliated
to
the
last
degree
vainly
endeavored
to
reply
with
his
usual
audacity
and
spirit
finding
all
efforts
to
recover
his
impossible
he
stammered
forth
a
few
incoherent
words
and
hastily
took
his
leave
the
desire
of
winning
the
approbation
of
anne
boleyn
at
the
expense
of
her
had
caused
him
to
commit
a
great
blunder
and
he
received
nothing
in
return
to
remove
the
caustic
arrows
from
his
humiliated
and
deeply
wounded
spirit
extremely
brilliant
and
animated
in
conversation
lady
rochford
was
accustomed
to
the
laugh
entirely
on
her
own
side
which
knowing
so
very
well
anne
had
pretended
not
to
understand
the
conversation
although
the
remarks
had
been
so
very
piquant
as
soon
as
he
had
retired
cromwell
became
the
subject
of
conversation
and
anne
timidly
and
with
no
little
hesitation
ventured
to
remonstrate
with
her
expressing
her
regret
that
the
conversation
should
have
been
made
so
personal
as
she
liked
cromwell
very
much
that
is
just
what
you
are
wrong
in
doing
replied
lady
rochford
he
is
a
deceitful
and
dangerous
man
he
pretends
to
be
extremely
devoted
to
you
but
it
is
only
because
he
believes
he
can
make
you
useful
to
himself
and
he
is
full
of
avarice
and
ambition
this
you
will
discover
when
it
is
perhaps
too
late
and
i
advise
you
to
reflect
seriously
on
the
subject
it
is
so
cruel
to
be
mistaken
in
the
choice
of
a
friend
that
truly
the
surer
and
better
way
would
seem
to
be
to
form
no
friendships
at
all
there
are
so
few
so
very
few
whose
affections
are
pure
and
disinterested
that
they
scarcely
ever
withstand
the
ordeal
of
misfortune
or
the
loss
of
those
extraneous
advantages
with
which
they
found
us
speak
like
a
book
my
dear
sister
cried
lady
boleyn
laughing
aloud
like
a
book
that
has
been
sent
me
from
france
with
such
beautiful
silver
saying
this
she
ran
to
fetch
the
book
which
she
had
opened
that
evening
in
the
middle
not
having
sufficient
curiosity
to
examine
the
title
or
inquire
the
name
of
the
author
of
the
volume
she
opened
it
naturally
at
the
same
place
and
read
what
follows
which
was
as
far
as
could
be
discovered
the
fragment
of
a
letter
ask
me
for
the
definition
of
a
friend
in
reply
i
am
compelled
to
declare
that
the
term
has
become
so
vague
and
so
obscure
it
has
been
used
in
so
many
senses
and
applied
to
so
many
persons
i
shall
first
be
obliged
to
give
you
a
description
of
what
is
called
a
friend
in
the
world
a
title
equivalent
in
my
estimation
to
the
most
complete
indifference
intermingled
at
the
same
time
with
no
insignificant
degree
of
envy
and
jealousy
for
instance
i
hear
de
clèves
speaking
of
his
friend
joyeuse
and
he
remarks
simply
know
more
about
him
than
anybody
else
i
have
been
his
most
intimate
friend
for
a
great
many
years
he
is
meanly
avaricious
i
have
reproached
him
for
it
a
hundred
a
little
further
on
and
i
hear
the
great
de
chaumont
exclaim
is
a
most
charming
woman
everybody
is
devoted
to
her
but
this
popularity
can
not
last
long
she
is
full
of
vanity
intolerably
conceited
and
silly
it
really
amuses
me
i
go
on
still
further
and
meet
a
friend
who
takes
me
enthusiastically
by
both
hands
i
expected
a
visit
from
you
yesterday
and
was
quite
in
despair
that
you
did
not
come
you
know
how
delighted
i
always
am
to
see
you
and
how
highly
i
appreciate
your
visits
but
i
happen
to
have
very
keen
eyes
and
an
ear
extremely
acute
and
delicate
and
i
distinctly
heard
her
whisper
to
her
friend
as
i
approached
them
fortunate
i
have
been
to
escape
this
visit
what
a
change
i
did
not
think
it
could
last
long
well
with
friends
like
these
you
will
find
the
world
crowded
they
will
obstruct
so
to
speak
every
hour
of
your
life
but
it
is
rare
indeed
to
encounter
one
who
is
true
and
loyal
a
friend
of
the
heart
a
man
truly
virtuous
and
sincerely
religious
is
alone
capable
of
comprehending
and
loving
with
pure
and
exalted
friendship
a
man
of
the
world
on
the
contrary
accustomed
to
refer
everything
to
himself
and
consulting
his
own
desires
becomes
his
own
idol
and
on
the
altar
of
offers
up
the
only
sincere
worship
of
which
his
sordid
soul
is
capable
and
you
will
find
he
will
always
end
by
sacrificing
to
his
own
interests
and
passions
the
dearest
interests
of
the
being
who
confided
in
his
friendship
with
the
sincere
and
earnest
friend
love
and
gratitude
are
necessities
of
his
nature
they
constitute
the
unbroken
chain
which
links
all
pure
and
reasonable
friendship
he
will
assist
his
friend
in
all
emergencies
for
he
has
assumed
in
a
manner
even
his
responsibilities
he
will
never
flatter
his
counsel
and
advice
on
the
contrary
may
be
severely
administered
because
it
is
impossible
to
be
happy
without
being
virtuous
and
the
happiness
of
his
friend
is
as
dear
to
him
as
his
own
he
is
ready
to
sacrifice
his
own
interests
to
those
of
his
friend
and
none
would
dare
attack
his
reputation
in
his
presence
for
they
know
he
will
defend
and
sustain
him
under
all
circumstances
sympathizing
in
his
misfortunes
mingling
tears
with
his
tears
in
a
word
that
it
is
another
self
whom
they
would
presume
to
attack
itself
can
not
dissolve
the
ties
of
such
an
affection
the
soul
nearer
to
god
will
continue
to
implore
unceasingly
for
him
the
divine
benediction
oh
what
joy
what
happiness
to
participate
in
a
friendship
so
pure
and
exalted
he
who
can
claim
one
such
friend
possesses
a
source
of
unbounded
joy
and
an
inexhaustible
consolation
of
which
cruel
adversity
can
never
deprive
him
if
prosperity
dazzles
him
with
its
dangerous
splendor
if
sorrow
pierce
him
with
her
dart
if
melancholy
annihilate
the
life
of
his
soul
then
ever
near
him
abides
this
friend
like
a
precious
gift
which
god
alone
had
power
to
bestow
queen
catherine
was
walking
in
that
portion
of
the
vast
grounds
of
greenwich
called
the
garden
which
in
happier
days
had
often
been
her
favorite
retreat
jets
of
limpid
water
conveyed
by
means
of
pipes
through
the
grounds
burst
in
every
direction
and
then
fell
in
silvery
showers
among
the
lovely
parterres
of
flowers
and
covered
the
green
velvet
turf
with
a
glittering
veil
of
spray
on
the
bosom
of
the
murmuring
waters
floated
myriads
of
leaves
and
flowers
flung
with
gentle
hand
by
the
wooing
breeze
while
thousands
of
gold
fishes
sported
amid
their
crystal
depths
the
eye
of
the
stranger
was
at
once
arrested
and
ravished
by
these
marvels
of
nature
and
art
admiring
the
power
and
riches
thus
united
but
the
queen
with
slow
and
painful
steps
only
sought
this
solitude
for
liberty
there
to
indulge
her
tears
in
silence
and
oblivion
at
no
great
distance
mary
full
of
joy
engaged
in
the
sportive
plays
of
the
ladies
of
the
queen
a
golden
insect
or
a
brilliant
butterfly
was
the
only
conquest
to
which
she
aspired
gaily
flitting
from
place
to
place
with
step
so
light
that
her
little
feet
scarcely
impressed
the
delicate
white
sand
covering
the
walks
her
shouts
of
expectation
and
happiness
were
still
powerless
to
rejoice
the
maternal
heart
catherine
hastily
withdrew
from
the
scene
fatigued
and
worn
with
suffering
she
regarded
with
painful
indifference
all
that
surrounded
her
in
the
meantime
one
of
the
gardeners
advanced
towards
her
and
presented
a
bouquet
it
said
she
one
of
my
and
she
turned
away
but
the
gardener
would
not
withdraw
queen
does
not
recognize
me
he
said
at
length
in
a
low
voice
more
exclaimed
catherine
greatly
agitated
always
faithful
but
why
expose
yourself
thus
to
serve
me
go
on
i
will
follow
and
catherine
continued
her
walk
until
she
reached
a
wide
and
extended
avenue
planted
with
venerable
old
lindens
she
exclaimed
trembling
with
fear
yet
still
indulging
a
slight
hope
have
you
to
tell
me
speak
oh
speak
quickly
i
fear
we
may
be
observed
every
step
of
mine
is
cried
more
general
peace
has
been
concluded
the
difficulty
with
the
holy
see
is
ended
he
consents
to
surrender
all
the
conquered
territory
originally
belonging
to
the
ecclesiastical
states
he
binds
himself
to
the
dominion
of
the
medici
in
florence
he
abandons
sforza
leaving
the
pope
absolute
master
of
the
destiny
of
that
prince
and
the
sovereignty
of
the
milanese
urged
on
by
these
concessions
the
two
princesses
cut
short
their
negotiations
and
the
treaty
between
france
and
austria
was
concluded
immediately
your
appeal
and
protestation
have
been
despatched
and
conveyed
safely
out
of
the
kingdom
the
messenger
to
whom
they
were
entrusted
was
most
rigorously
searched
but
the
papers
were
so
securely
and
adroitly
concealed
they
were
not
discovered
they
were
carried
to
antwerp
by
peter
gilles
the
of
my
heart
and
from
thence
he
despatched
them
to
rome
hope
therefore
hope
let
us
all
hope
more
replied
the
queen
who
had
listened
with
deep
anxiety
that
i
were
able
to
acknowledge
your
services
as
i
appreciate
them
your
friendship
has
been
my
only
consolation
but
i
know
not
why
it
is
hope
every
day
grows
more
and
more
faint
in
my
heart
and
so
utterly
insensible
to
joy
have
i
become
that
it
seems
now
i
am
incapable
of
aught
but
suffering
and
that
for
me
i
fear
greater
sorrow
is
to
be
do
you
say
madam
replied
more
sadly
discouraging
and
painful
to
your
servants
to
hear
such
reflections
from
you
at
the
very
moment
when
everything
becomes
favorable
to
your
cause
the
emperor
will
use
his
influence
at
the
court
of
rome
and
francis
between
the
two
allies
will
at
least
be
forced
to
remain
were
the
conditions
of
the
treaty
of
cambrai
asked
the
queen
were
very
hard
and
exacting
replied
more
king
of
france
entirely
renounces
his
pretensions
to
burgundy
and
italy
thus
nine
years
of
war
the
battle
of
pavia
and
a
humiliating
captivity
become
of
no
avail
he
sacrifices
all
even
his
allies
fearing
to
add
to
these
harsh
conditions
the
reconciliation
of
their
interests
he
abandoned
to
the
mercy
of
the
emperor
without
the
slightest
stipulation
the
venetians
the
florentines
the
duke
of
ferrara
and
the
neapolitan
barons
who
were
attached
to
his
a
cruel
error
exclaimed
the
queen
prince
has
surely
forgotten
that
even
in
political
and
state
affairs
he
who
once
sacrifices
his
friends
can
not
hope
to
recall
them
ever
again
to
his
support
it
is
very
evident
that
he
has
not
more
prudent
nor
wise
counsellors
in
his
cabinet
than
skilful
and
accomplished
generals
in
the
field
who
now
among
them
all
can
be
compared
with
pescaire
anthony
de
lêve
or
the
prince
of
orange
might
have
had
them
madam
if
his
own
negligence
and
the
wickedness
of
his
courtiers
had
not
alienated
and
driven
them
away
the
constable
of
bourbon
moran
and
doria
would
have
powerfully
counterbalanced
the
talents
and
influence
of
the
chiefs
you
have
just
named
had
the
king
of
france
engaged
them
in
his
own
cause
instead
of
having
to
encounter
them
in
the
ranks
of
his
enemies
his
undaunted
courage
and
personal
valor
however
have
alone
caused
the
unequal
and
hopeless
contest
to
be
so
long
what
does
your
king
say
of
these
affairs
asked
the
queen
anxiously
madam
he
seems
but
little
satisfied
responded
more
hesitating
is
just
as
i
suspected
replied
the
queen
it
is
because
he
foresees
new
obstacles
to
the
unjust
divorce
he
is
prosecuting
with
so
much
ardor
o
more
she
continued
bursting
into
tears
have
i
done
to
merit
such
cruel
treatment
when
i
look
back
on
the
happy
years
of
my
youth
the
years
when
he
loved
me
so
tenderly
when
i
recall
the
devoted
and
affectionate
demonstrations
of
those
days
and
compare
them
with
the
actual
rudeness
and
severity
of
the
present
my
bleeding
heart
is
crushed
by
this
sorrow
what
have
i
done
more
to
lose
thus
so
suddenly
and
entirely
my
affection
it
is
true
the
freshness
of
my
early
youth
has
faded
but
was
it
to
such
ephemeral
advantages
alone
i
owed
his
devotion
can
a
marriage
be
contracted
by
a
man
with
the
intention
of
dissolving
it
as
soon
as
the
personal
attractions
the
youthful
charms
of
his
wife
have
faded
oh
it
seems
to
me
it
should
be
just
the
contrary
and
that
the
hour
of
affliction
should
only
call
forth
deeper
proofs
of
affection
no
more
no
neither
you
nor
any
other
of
my
friends
will
be
able
to
accomplish
anything
for
me
i
feel
that
my
life
is
rapidly
ebbing
away
that
my
spirit
is
crushed
and
broken
for
ever
for
admitting
even
that
henry
will
not
be
successful
in
his
attempt
to
sever
the
sacred
bonds
of
our
union
what
happiness
could
i
ever
hope
to
enjoy
near
one
to
whom
i
had
become
an
object
of
aversion
who
would
behold
in
me
only
an
invincible
obstacle
to
his
will
and
the
gratification
of
his
criminal
and
disorderly
passions
madam
replied
more
are
all
grieved
at
the
contemplation
of
the
great
affliction
by
which
you
are
overwhelmed
and
how
much
do
we
wish
the
expression
of
our
sympathy
and
devotion
had
power
to
relieve
you
but
remember
the
princess
of
wales
you
will
surely
never
cease
to
defend
her
never
exclaimed
the
queen
passionately
is
the
sole
inducement
i
have
once
more
to
arouse
myself
it
sustains
my
courage
and
animates
my
resolution
when
health
and
spirits
both
fail
o
more
could
you
but
know
all
that
passes
in
the
depths
of
my
soul
could
you
but
realize
for
one
moment
the
anguish
and
agony
the
deep
interior
humiliation
into
which
i
am
plunged
oh
fatal
and
for
ever
unfortunate
day
when
i
left
my
country
and
the
royal
house
of
my
father
why
was
i
not
born
in
obscurity
would
not
my
life
then
have
passed
quietly
and
without
regret
far
from
the
tumult
of
the
world
and
the
éclat
of
thrones
i
should
have
been
extremely
happy
now
i
am
dying
and
it
really
yourself
madam
answered
more
thus
gives
way
to
such
weakness
truly
it
is
unworthy
of
your
rank
and
still
more
of
your
virtues
when
adversity
overtakes
us
we
should
summon
all
our
courage
and
resolution
you
are
our
queen
and
you
should
remember
your
daughter
is
born
sovereign
of
this
realm
beneath
whose
soil
our
buried
forefathers
sleep
no
no
heaven
will
never
permit
the
blood
of
such
a
race
to
be
sullied
by
that
of
an
ambitious
and
degraded
woman
that
noble
race
will
triumph
be
assured
of
it
and
in
that
triumph
the
honor
of
our
country
will
shine
forth
with
renewed
glory
and
splendor
i
swear
it
by
my
head
and
hope
it
in
my
heart
as
he
said
these
words
footsteps
were
heard
and
catherine
perceived
the
king
coming
towards
them
she
turned
instantly
pale
but
remaining
calm
in
the
dangerous
crisis
made
a
sign
for
more
to
withdraw
the
king
immediately
approached
her
and
observing
with
heartless
indifference
the
traces
of
recent
tears
on
her
cheek
exclaimed
in
tears
then
assuming
a
playful
manner
he
continued
kate
you
must
confess
that
you
are
always
singularly
sad
and
depressed
and
the
walls
of
a
convent
would
suit
you
much
better
than
this
beautiful
garden
you
have
in
your
hand
a
fine
bouquet
i
see
at
least
you
still
love
do
indeed
replied
the
queen
with
a
deep
sigh
said
henry
do
not
mean
to
reproach
you
but
it
would
be
advisable
not
to
hold
those
roses
so
close
to
your
cheek
the
contrast
might
be
unfavorable
is
it
not
so
my
old
kate
have
you
seen
the
falcons
just
sent
me
from
scotland
they
are
of
a
very
rare
species
and
trained
to
perfection
i
am
going
out
now
to
try
wish
your
majesty
a
pleasant
morning
answered
the
queen
kate
he
continued
proceeding
on
his
way
and
giving
in
the
exuberance
of
his
spirits
a
flourish
with
his
trumpet
very
soon
the
notes
of
the
announced
his
arrival
in
the
outer
courtyard
he
found
there
assembled
a
crowd
of
lords
and
pages
followed
by
falconers
carrying
the
new
birds
on
their
wrists
these
birds
were
fettered
and
wore
on
their
heads
little
leathern
hoods
which
were
to
be
removed
at
the
moment
they
mounted
in
the
air
in
search
of
their
accustomed
prey
in
a
very
short
time
the
party
rode
off
and
catherine
thoughtfully
entered
the
palace
thinking
it
was
a
long
time
since
the
king
had
shown
himself
so
indulgent
and
gracious
towards
her
you
well
assured
of
the
truth
of
these
statements
said
the
king
returning
cromwell
a
letter
he
had
just
read
i
will
not
believe
it
he
cried
stamping
his
foot
violently
on
the
floor
of
his
cabinet
certainly
hoped
to
have
gained
the
legate
your
majesty
may
no
longer
indulge
in
this
illusion
replied
cromwell
who
stood
before
the
king
in
an
attitude
the
most
humble
and
servile
possible
to
assume
are
furnished
with
incontrovertible
proof
campeggio
in
order
to
escape
your
imperious
commands
urges
the
pope
to
evoke
the
trial
to
his
own
tribunal
of
this
there
is
no
doubt
for
this
copy
of
his
letter
i
received
from
the
hand
of
his
confidential
are
very
adroit
sir
replied
the
king
haughtily
i
will
consider
the
manner
of
rewarding
you
but
i
declare
to
you
your
patron
is
on
the
brink
of
ruin
i
shall
never
pardon
him
for
permitting
that
protest
and
appeal
of
the
queen
to
reach
was
truly
an
unfortunate
affair
replied
cromwell
it
was
perhaps
not
the
fault
of
my
lord
cardinal
fault
was
it
then
demanded
henry
in
the
imperious
tone
he
used
to
disconcert
this
spy
whenever
his
reports
displeased
him
queen
has
friends
replied
cromwell
whilst
on
his
thin
colorless
lips
hovered
a
false
and
treacherous
smile
worthy
of
the
wicked
instinct
that
prompted
and
directed
all
his
suspicions
and
made
him
foresee
the
surest
plan
of
injuring
those
whom
he
envied
or
destroying
those
whose
reputation
he
intended
to
attack
who
are
they
demanded
the
king
his
increasing
with
the
reflection
do
you
not
name
them
sir
for
instance
sir
thomas
more
whom
your
majesty
loads
with
favors
and
distinctions
the
bishop
of
rochester
the
duke
of
norfolk
and
will
soon
accuse
my
entire
court
and
each
one
of
my
servants
in
particular
cried
the
king
in
order
still
more
to
exasperate
and
astound
me
you
have
taken
particular
pains
to
select
and
name
those
whom
i
most
esteem
and
who
have
always
given
me
the
sincerest
proofs
of
their
devoted
affection
go
he
suddenly
cried
in
a
furious
tone
and
he
fell
into
one
of
those
wild
transports
of
rage
that
frequently
attacked
him
when
his
will
clashed
against
obstacles
which
he
foresaw
he
could
neither
surmount
nor
destroy
he
often
passed
entire
days
absorbed
in
these
moods
of
violence
shut
up
in
his
own
apartments
suffering
none
to
speak
to
or
approach
him
nor
on
any
account
to
attempt
to
divert
him
abashed
and
alarmed
cromwell
hastily
withdrew
stammering
the
most
humble
apologies
none
of
which
however
reached
the
ear
of
henry
who
on
returning
to
his
chamber
raving
in
a
demoniacal
manner
exclaimed
slaves
you
shall
be
taught
to
know
and
to
respect
my
power
i
will
make
you
sorely
repent
the
hour
you
have
dared
to
oppose
me
just
as
he
had
uttered
this
threatening
exclamation
cardinal
wolsey
appeared
he
could
not
have
chosen
a
more
inauspicious
moment
the
instant
he
beheld
him
the
king
glaring
on
him
with
flashing
eyes
cried
out
what
has
brought
you
here
do
you
know
the
ambassadors
of
charles
and
ferdinand
fortified
by
the
appeal
and
protest
have
overthrown
all
i
had
accomplished
at
rome
with
so
much
precaution
and
difficulty
why
have
you
not
foreseen
these
contingencies
and
known
that
the
pope
would
prove
inflexible
why
have
you
not
advised
me
against
undertaking
an
almost
impossible
thing
which
will
sully
the
honor
of
my
name
and
obscure
for
all
time
the
glory
of
my
sire
replied
wolsey
do
not
deserve
these
cruel
reproaches
you
can
readily
recall
how
earnestly
i
endeavored
to
dissuade
you
from
your
purpose
but
all
my
efforts
were
is
false
cried
the
king
giving
vent
to
his
rage
in
the
most
shocking
and
violent
expressions
he
could
command
to
inflict
upon
his
minister
now
he
continued
well
if
you
fail
to
extort
from
your
legate
such
a
decision
as
i
require
you
shall
speedily
be
taught
what
it
is
to
deride
my
the
sun
had
scarcely
risen
above
the
horizon
when
already
cardinal
campeggio
whose
age
and
infirmities
had
not
changed
the
long
habits
of
an
austere
and
laborious
life
was
silently
kneeling
in
the
midst
of
the
choir
of
the
palace
chapel
the
velvet
cushions
of
his
protected
him
from
the
cold
marble
of
the
sacred
pavement
while
the
rays
of
the
rising
sun
descending
in
luminous
jets
through
the
arches
of
the
antique
windows
fell
on
the
head
of
the
venerable
old
man
giving
him
the
appearance
of
being
surrounded
by
a
halo
of
celestial
light
his
eyes
were
cast
down
and
he
seemed
to
be
entirely
absorbed
in
pious
and
profound
meditation
other
thoughts
however
intruded
on
his
agitated
mind
and
filled
him
with
anxious
apprehension
hour
rapidly
approaches
he
mentally
exclaimed
hour
when
it
will
be
essential
to
come
to
a
decision
i
have
still
hoped
to
receive
a
reply
it
has
not
yet
arrived
i
alone
am
made
responsible
and
doubtless
the
wrath
of
the
king
will
burst
upon
my
head
his
vengeance
will
be
terrible
more
than
once
already
he
has
taken
occasion
to
manifest
it
what
cruel
incertitude
what
dreadful
suspense
yet
what
shall
be
done
speak
o
my
conscience
he
exclaimed
me
listen
and
be
guided
by
thy
voice
alone
the
power
of
the
king
who
demands
of
thee
an
injustice
immediately
replied
that
faithful
monitor
whose
stern
and
inflexible
voice
will
be
summoned
to
testify
against
us
at
the
last
judgment
thou
thou
art
afraid
then
thou
hast
forgotten
that
the
last
even
of
those
gray
hairs
still
remaining
to
thee
can
not
fall
without
the
permission
of
him
who
created
the
universe
know
that
the
anger
of
man
is
but
as
a
vain
report
a
sound
that
vanishes
in
space
and
that
god
permits
thee
not
to
hesitate
for
one
instant
o
judge
when
the
cause
of
the
feeble
and
the
innocent
claims
all
the
strength
of
thy
irrevocably
decided
campeggio
continued
his
prayer
and
waited
without
further
apprehension
the
decisive
moment
so
rapidly
approaching
in
the
meantime
another
cardinal
wolsey
in
great
anguish
of
mind
contemplated
with
terror
the
approaching
day
when
he
would
be
compelled
to
decide
the
fate
of
the
queen
weary
after
passing
a
sleepless
night
spent
in
reflecting
on
the
punishment
threatening
him
if
the
will
of
the
king
was
not
accomplished
he
had
scarcely
closed
his
eyes
when
a
troop
of
valets
entered
the
chamber
to
assist
at
his
toilet
they
brought
his
richest
vestments
with
all
the
insignia
of
his
elevated
rank
wolsey
regarded
them
with
a
feeling
of
terror
and
when
they
presented
him
the
ivory
rod
which
the
is
alone
empowered
to
carry
he
seized
it
with
convulsive
eagerness
grasping
it
in
his
hand
as
though
he
feared
they
would
tear
it
from
him
and
with
that
fear
the
reflection
overshadowed
his
soul
that
yesterday
he
had
made
a
last
effort
to
ascertain
and
influence
the
decision
of
the
legate
without
being
able
to
succeed
followed
by
his
pages
and
gentlemen
and
still
harassed
by
these
misgivings
he
arrived
at
blackfriars
where
the
court
awaited
him
the
assembly
of
cardinals
arose
deferentially
as
he
entered
though
all
remarked
with
astonishment
the
pallor
of
his
countenance
and
his
extreme
embarrassment
of
manner
so
invariably
composed
and
assured
a
portion
of
this
visible
restraint
was
communicated
to
the
assembly
on
learning
that
the
king
himself
had
arrived
and
was
resolved
to
sit
in
the
adjoining
apartment
where
he
could
see
and
hear
the
entire
proceedings
bell
his
advocate
after
a
long
preamble
began
a
discourse
and
during
its
delivery
hurried
exclamations
and
hasty
comments
were
constantly
indulged
in
by
the
excited
assembly
so
different
in
their
hopes
desires
and
opinions
rochester
cried
more
invested
with
the
grand
official
robes
of
the
exchequer
you
think
this
man
will
succeed
with
his
arguments
in
carrying
the
crown
by
storm
no
replied
rochester
especially
as
he
wishes
to
place
it
upon
such
a
listen
listen
exclaimed
more
declares
the
brief
of
dispensation
to
have
been
a
what
notorious
bad
faith
murmured
the
bishop
answer
can
they
make
to
that
said
viscount
rochford
in
another
part
of
the
hall
addressing
the
lords
belonging
to
anne
party
is
certainly
encouraging
we
can
not
doubt
of
our
success
but
at
length
the
arguments
principally
dictated
by
henry
himself
were
closed
his
advocate
demanding
in
the
most
haughty
and
authoritative
manner
that
a
decision
should
at
once
be
rendered
and
that
it
should
be
as
favorable
as
it
was
prompt
the
king
during
this
time
in
a
state
of
great
excitement
paced
to
and
fro
before
the
entrance
of
the
hall
the
door
being
left
open
by
every
one
in
passing
as
if
he
were
afraid
to
close
it
behind
him
he
surveyed
from
time
to
time
with
a
glance
of
stern
penetrating
scrutiny
the
assembly
before
him
each
member
of
which
tried
to
conceal
his
true
sentiments
some
because
they
were
secretly
attached
to
the
queen
others
through
fear
that
the
cause
of
anne
boleyn
might
ultimately
triumph
when
the
advocate
had
finished
his
discourse
each
one
sat
in
breathless
suspense
anxiously
waiting
the
reply
but
not
recognizing
the
authority
or
legality
of
the
tribunal
she
had
refused
to
accept
counsel
and
no
one
consequently
appeared
to
defend
her
profound
silence
reigned
throughout
the
assembly
and
all
eyes
were
turned
toward
campeggio
who
arose
and
stood
ready
to
speak
the
venerable
old
man
calm
and
dignified
in
a
mild
but
firm
and
decided
tone
began
ask
or
rather
you
demand
he
said
we
pronounce
a
decision
which
it
would
be
impossible
for
us
in
justice
to
here
on
seeing
the
king
turn
abruptly
around
and
confront
him
he
paused
looking
steadily
at
him
that
the
defendant
hath
challenged
this
court
and
refused
to
recognize
in
our
persons
loyal
and
disinterested
judges
i
have
considered
it
my
duty
in
order
to
avoid
error
to
submit
every
part
of
the
proceedings
of
this
council
to
the
tribunal
of
the
sovereign
pontiff
and
we
shall
be
compelled
to
await
his
decision
before
rendering
judgment
or
proceeding
further
for
myself
individually
i
will
furthermore
affirm
that
i
am
here
to
render
justice
strict
entire
and
impartial
justice
and
no
earthly
power
can
induce
me
to
deviate
from
the
course
i
have
adopted
or
the
resolutions
i
have
taken
and
i
boldly
declare
that
i
am
too
old
too
feeble
and
too
ill
to
desire
the
favor
or
fear
the
resentment
of
any
living
here
he
sat
down
visibly
agitated
had
a
thunderbolt
fallen
in
the
midst
of
the
assembly
the
tumult
and
astonishment
could
not
have
been
greater
anger
joy
fear
hope
all
hearts
were
agitated
by
the
most
contradictory
emotions
while
nothing
was
heard
but
the
deep
murmur
of
voices
the
noise
of
unintelligible
words
as
they
crossed
and
clashed
in
an
endless
diversity
of
tones
the
duke
of
suffolk
of
the
king
cried
out
beating
his
fists
violently
on
the
table
before
him
with
the
gross
impetuosity
of
an
upstart
soldier
that
the
old
adage
had
again
been
verified
did
a
cardinal
do
any
good
in
and
with
flashing
eyes
and
furious
gestures
he
pointed
to
cardinal
wolsey
the
cardinal
at
once
comprehended
his
danger
but
found
it
impossible
not
to
resent
the
insult
he
arose
pale
with
anger
and
with
forced
calmness
replied
that
the
duke
of
all
living
men
had
the
least
cause
to
depreciate
cardinals
for
notwithstanding
he
had
himself
been
a
very
insignificant
cardinal
yet
if
he
had
not
held
the
office
the
duke
of
suffolk
would
not
this
day
actually
carry
his
head
on
big
shoulders
you
would
not
now
he
added
here
to
exhibit
the
ostentatious
disdain
you
have
manifested
toward
those
who
have
never
given
you
cause
of
offence
if
you
were
my
lord
an
ambassador
of
the
king
to
some
foreign
power
you
would
surely
not
venture
to
decide
important
questions
without
first
consulting
your
sovereign
we
also
are
commissioners
and
we
have
no
power
to
pronounce
judgment
without
first
consulting
those
from
whom
we
derive
our
authority
we
can
do
neither
more
nor
less
than
our
commissions
permit
calm
yourself
then
my
lord
and
no
more
address
in
this
insulting
manner
your
best
friend
you
very
well
know
all
i
have
done
for
you
and
you
must
also
acknowledge
that
on
no
occasion
have
i
ever
referred
to
your
obligations
but
the
duke
of
suffolk
heard
nothing
of
the
last
words
uttered
by
wolsey
exasperated
beyond
measure
he
abruptly
turned
his
back
on
the
cardinal
and
went
to
join
the
king
in
the
next
apartment
he
found
the
latter
in
the
act
of
retiring
being
no
longer
able
to
restrain
his
wrath
within
bounds
and
as
his
courtiers
entered
and
stood
regarding
him
with
a
look
of
hesitation
he
went
out
commanding
them
in
a
fierce
tone
and
with
an
imperious
gesture
to
follow
him
immediately
meanwhile
in
the
council
chamber
the
utmost
confusion
prevailed
be
praised
cried
sir
thomas
more
who
in
the
simplicity
of
his
heart
and
the
excess
of
his
joy
was
incapable
of
dissimulation
or
concealment
be
praised
our
queen
is
still
queen
and
may
she
ever
triumph
thus
over
all
her
enemies
ensconced
in
the
deep
embrasure
of
a
window
stood
cromwell
a
silent
observer
of
the
scene
not
permitting
a
word
to
escape
him
but
gathering
up
every
sentence
with
keen
avidity
and
cherishing
it
in
his
envious
and
malicious
memory
he
found
himself
nevertheless
in
a
precarious
and
embarrassing
situation
foreseeing
the
downfall
and
disgrace
of
wolsey
he
had
sought
to
make
friends
by
betraying
his
benefactor
but
the
king
treated
him
with
indignant
scorn
viscount
rochford
with
supreme
contempt
and
he
strongly
suspected
he
had
prejudiced
his
sister
anne
boleyn
also
against
him
anxious
and
alarmed
he
at
once
determined
to
begin
weaving
a
new
web
of
intrigue
and
instantly
cast
about
him
to
discover
what
hope
remained
or
what
results
the
future
might
possibly
bring
forth
from
the
discord
and
difficulties
reigning
in
the
present
when
selfish
corrupt
creatures
like
cromwell
find
themselves
surrounded
by
great
and
important
events
they
at
once
assume
to
become
identified
with
the
dearest
interests
of
the
community
in
which
they
live
without
however
in
reality
being
in
the
slightest
degree
affected
unless
through
their
own
interests
seeking
always
themselves
and
themselves
alone
thus
this
heartless
man
this
shameful
leprosy
of
the
social
body
that
had
nurtured
him
regarding
the
whole
world
entirely
with
reference
to
his
own
selfish
designs
coolly
speculated
upon
his
premeditated
crimes
revolving
in
his
mind
a
thousand
projects
of
aggrandizement
which
he
ultimately
succeeded
in
bringing
to
a
culpable
but
thoroughly
successful
termination
the
night
had
already
come
yet
all
were
in
a
state
of
commotion
in
the
household
of
the
french
ambassador
in
consequence
of
william
du
bellay
his
brother
having
at
a
late
hour
received
a
few
hasty
lines
from
the
bishop
written
in
the
midst
of
the
assembly
at
blackfriars
commanding
him
to
hold
himself
in
readiness
to
depart
the
young
envoy
at
once
obeying
orders
assumed
his
travelling
costume
and
had
scarcely
more
than
attended
to
the
last
instructions
of
his
brother
when
the
latter
made
his
appearance
brother
he
exclaimed
on
entering
the
chamber
is
over
are
you
ready
to
set
out
he
continued
hurriedly
surveying
his
travelling
attire
king
is
furiously
enraged
first
against
the
legate
then
against
wolsey
but
campeggio
has
displayed
an
extraordinary
degree
of
firmness
and
courage
after
he
had
refused
to
pronounce
the
decision
and
just
as
the
king
was
retiring
the
expected
courier
arrived
with
instructions
from
rome
the
protestation
has
been
received
and
the
pope
dissolving
the
council
revokes
the
authority
and
requires
the
case
to
be
brought
before
his
own
tribunal
the
adherents
of
catherine
as
you
may
suppose
are
wild
with
delight
the
people
throng
the
streets
shouting
live
the
queen
our
gracious
king
francis
will
be
in
replied
william
am
satisfied
for
i
am
in
favor
of
the
queen
and
now
between
ourselves
my
dear
brother
laying
all
diplomacy
aside
for
we
are
alone
and
these
walls
have
no
ears
i
know
as
well
as
you
that
it
matters
not
to
our
king
whether
the
wife
of
henry
viii
be
named
anne
or
catherine
yet
after
all
it
may
be
the
name
of
this
new
helen
will
become
the
signal
for
war
replied
the
bishop
forget
that
in
marrying
anne
boleyn
henry
will
be
compelled
to
seek
an
alliance
with
france
in
order
to
resist
the
opposition
of
the
emperor
charles
and
as
for
ourselves
we
have
use
for
the
five
thousand
crowns
he
has
promised
to
assist
us
in
paying
the
ransom
of
the
children
of
france
this
family
quarrel
can
be
arranged
so
entirely
to
our
advantage
that
it
would
really
be
a
misfortune
should
it
come
to
a
sudden
termination
i
hope
however
such
may
not
be
the
are
right
brother
said
du
bellay
laughing
see
i
have
too
much
heart
to
make
a
skilful
diplomatist
i
have
already
let
myself
become
ensnared
you
perceive
and
drawn
over
to
the
cause
of
this
queen
catherine
but
it
is
nevertheless
a
veritable
fact
while
families
are
engaged
in
disputing
among
themselves
they
generally
leave
their
neighbors
in
peace
it
would
seem
however
the
king
must
have
become
a
madman
or
a
fool
thus
to
ignore
kindred
allies
fortune
and
kingdom
all
for
this
lady
much
more
than
a
madman
replied
his
brother
phlegmatically
he
has
married
her
he
will
be
cured
of
his
insanity
but
come
now
let
us
leave
lady
anne
and
her
affairs
you
must
know
that
immediately
after
the
adjournment
of
the
cardinals
the
king
sent
for
me
i
found
him
terribly
excited
walking
rapidly
up
and
down
the
great
hall
formerly
used
as
a
by
the
monks
wolsey
alone
was
with
him
standing
near
the
great
and
wearing
an
air
of
consternation
the
instant
he
saw
me
approaching
he
cried
out
come
my
lord
the
king
wishes
to
have
your
advice
on
the
subject
we
are
now
and
i
at
once
perceived
my
presence
was
a
great
relief
to
him
king
spoke
immediately
while
his
eyes
flashed
fire
du
bellay
he
exclaimed
shall
be
punished
yes
punished
parliament
shall
bring
him
to
trial
i
will
never
submit
to
defeat
in
this
matter
i
will
show
the
pope
that
he
has
underrated
both
my
will
and
my
i
answered
mature
reflection
it
seems
to
me
it
would
be
a
mistaken
policy
in
your
majesty
to
resort
to
such
violent
measures
nothing
has
yet
been
decided
and
the
case
is
by
no
means
hopeless
the
wisest
course
would
therefore
be
to
restrain
all
manifestation
of
displeasure
toward
campeggio
what
advantage
could
you
possibly
gain
by
insulting
or
an
old
man
whom
you
have
invited
into
your
kingdom
or
how
could
you
then
expect
to
obtain
a
favorable
decision
from
the
holy
see
to
hear
me
express
such
opinions
wolsey
eagerly
caught
at
my
words
declaring
he
agreed
with
me
entirely
he
also
advised
that
the
doctors
of
the
french
and
german
universities
should
be
consulted
opinions
favorable
to
the
divorce
obtained
from
them
and
afterwards
this
high
authority
brought
to
bear
upon
the
decision
of
the
court
of
rome
do
you
think
of
that
demanded
the
king
of
me
for
his
eminence
monseigneur
wolsey
he
added
in
a
tone
of
cruel
contempt
his
counsels
have
already
led
me
into
so
many
difficulties
or
proved
so
worthless
i
shall
not
trouble
him
for
any
further
and
he
abruptly
turned
his
back
on
the
cardinal
tear
rolled
slowly
down
hollow
cheek
but
he
made
no
reply
i
at
once
assured
the
king
that
i
thought
on
the
contrary
the
advice
was
most
excellent
and
doubted
not
our
king
and
his
honored
mother
madame
louise
might
be
induced
to
use
their
influence
in
order
to
secure
him
the
suffrages
of
the
university
of
paris
whereupon
he
appeared
very
much
pleased
with
me
and
bowed
me
out
in
the
most
gracious
manner
imaginable
all
these
things
faithfully
to
your
master
tell
him
i
fear
the
downfall
of
wolsey
is
inevitable
he
is
equally
disliked
by
the
adherents
and
those
of
anne
boleyn
and
i
have
every
reason
for
believing
he
will
never
again
be
reinstated
in
the
favor
you
will
also
say
to
him
he
need
not
be
astonished
that
i
so
often
send
him
despatches
by
express
as
cardinal
wolsey
informs
me
confidentially
that
the
duke
of
suffolk
has
his
emissaries
bribed
to
open
all
packages
of
letters
sent
by
post
and
that
one
addressed
to
me
has
been
miscarried
which
circumstance
troubles
me
very
will
also
inform
my
master
replied
william
the
picardy
routes
are
so
badly
managed
the
gentlemen
and
couriers
he
sends
are
constantly
detained
and
kept
a
considerable
time
on
the
journey
i
have
complained
recently
to
the
authorities
themselves
who
assure
me
that
their
salaries
are
not
paid
and
consequently
they
are
unable
to
keep
the
routes
in
better
the
sun
descended
toward
the
horizon
sir
thomas
more
seated
on
a
terrace
of
his
mansion
at
chelsea
sought
temporary
quiet
and
repose
from
the
oppressive
burdens
of
a
life
every
hour
of
which
was
devoted
to
the
service
of
his
king
and
country
his
young
children
formed
a
joyous
group
around
him
their
flaxen
heads
crowned
with
blades
of
wheat
and
wild
flowers
they
had
gathered
in
the
fields
for
it
was
the
golden
time
of
harvest
margaret
assisted
by
william
roper
directed
their
games
and
was
now
trying
to
teach
them
a
scotch
dance
marking
the
wild
fantastical
rhythm
with
the
notes
of
her
sweet
melodious
voice
sir
thomas
himself
had
joined
in
their
play
when
suddenly
the
king
made
his
appearance
he
had
many
times
already
honored
them
with
such
visits
since
sir
thomas
became
a
member
of
the
council
having
apparently
conceived
a
great
affection
for
him
and
every
day
seeming
to
become
more
and
more
pleased
with
his
conversation
know
not
why
it
is
he
would
often
say
when
i
have
been
for
any
length
of
time
in
conversation
with
more
i
experience
a
singular
tranquillity
of
soul
and
indeed
feel
almost
happy
his
presence
has
the
magical
effect
of
lulling
my
cares
to
sleep
and
calming
my
on
seeing
the
king
more
immediately
advanced
with
great
deference
to
receive
him
while
the
children
at
once
left
off
their
sports
what
is
this
he
exclaimed
did
not
come
to
interrupt
your
amusements
but
on
the
contrary
to
enjoy
them
with
but
the
wild
mirth
and
of
the
children
had
fled
at
the
approach
of
royalty
and
in
spite
of
these
kind
assurances
they
withdrew
in
rapid
succession
too
glad
to
recover
their
liberty
and
their
father
was
thus
left
alone
with
the
king
is
the
young
man
i
see
here
inquired
the
sovereign
is
the
affianced
husband
of
my
daughter
sire
his
name
is
william
roper
answered
more
is
she
affianced
already
said
the
king
sire
the
family
of
roper
has
for
many
years
been
united
to
ours
by
the
sincerest
ties
of
friendship
and
strengthening
these
by
ties
of
blood
we
hope
greatly
to
increase
our
mutual
is
so
replied
the
king
they
will
doubtless
be
happy
in
your
families
you
preserve
liberty
of
choice
while
we
princes
born
to
thrones
sacrifice
our
interior
happiness
to
those
political
combinations
demanded
by
the
interests
of
our
replied
sir
thomas
who
understood
at
once
the
intention
was
to
introduce
the
subject
of
his
divorce
a
topic
he
especially
wished
to
avoid
believe
that
happiness
depends
on
ourselves
on
our
dispositions
and
the
manner
in
which
we
conduct
our
affairs
a
great
deal
more
than
on
circumstances
or
the
social
position
in
which
we
chance
to
be
born
there
are
some
who
possessing
every
advantage
in
life
are
still
unable
to
enjoy
it
we
would
suppose
them
to
be
perfectly
happy
and
they
really
should
be
so
but
true
happiness
consists
alone
in
tranquillity
of
soul
which
is
attained
by
always
doing
good
to
others
and
suffering
with
patient
submission
the
trials
and
afflictions
with
which
life
is
inevitably
beset
such
it
seems
to
me
is
the
circumscribed
circle
in
which
man
is
confined
it
is
well
with
him
so
long
as
he
accommodates
himself
to
its
legitimate
limits
but
all
is
lost
the
moment
he
endeavors
to
venture
beyond
am
every
day
more
entirely
convinced
that
this
figure
of
the
circle
is
a
painful
reality
replied
the
king
with
impatience
have
always
hoped
to
find
happiness
in
the
pursuit
of
pleasure
in
the
gratification
of
every
desire
and
believed
it
might
thus
be
attained
but
never
yet
have
i
been
able
to
grasp
means
your
majesty
expected
to
pass
through
the
world
without
trials
a
thing
utterly
impossible
added
more
smiling
is
that
which
makes
me
despair
my
dear
thomas
reflecting
on
the
bitter
disappointments
i
have
experienced
i
am
often
almost
transported
with
rage
no
more
you
can
never
understand
me
you
are
always
equally
calm
and
joyous
your
desires
are
so
happily
directed
that
you
can
feel
well
assured
of
a
peaceful
quiet
future
awaiting
majesty
is
entirely
mistaken
replied
more
you
believe
i
have
never
entertained
other
desires
than
those
i
have
been
able
to
accomplish
the
only
secret
i
possess
in
that
respect
is
i
compel
my
inclinations
to
obey
instead
of
making
my
will
subservient
to
them
nevertheless
they
oftentimes
rebel
and
contend
bitterly
for
supremacy
but
then
it
is
only
necessary
to
command
silence
and
not
be
disturbed
by
their
cries
and
lamentations
ultimately
they
become
like
refractory
children
who
constantly
punished
and
severely
beaten
at
last
are
made
to
tremble
at
the
very
thought
of
the
chastisement
and
no
longer
dare
to
explanation
of
your
system
of
is
very
ingenious
replied
the
king
hearing
you
speak
in
this
quiet
manner
one
would
be
induced
to
believe
it
were
the
easiest
thing
imaginable
to
accomplish
rather
than
the
most
difficult
ah
he
continued
with
a
deep
sigh
understand
but
too
well
is
true
replied
more
with
earnest
simplicity
i
would
not
deny
that
far
from
being
agreeable
it
is
often
on
the
contrary
exceedingly
painful
and
difficult
for
a
man
to
impose
these
violent
restraints
upon
his
inclinations
but
if
he
who
hesitates
on
all
occasions
in
the
practice
of
virtue
to
do
this
necessary
violence
to
himself
and
remain
faithful
to
the
requirements
of
duty
would
reflect
but
for
a
single
instant
he
will
find
that
although
at
first
he
may
escape
suffering
and
privation
by
voluntarily
abandoning
himself
to
his
passions
yet
later
he
will
inevitably
be
made
to
endure
a
far
more
bitter
humiliation
in
the
torturing
reproaches
of
conscience
the
shame
he
will
suffer
in
the
loss
of
and
the
respect
of
others
and
in
the
inevitable
course
of
events
he
will
at
last
discover
that
his
passions
have
carried
him
far
beyond
the
power
of
or
reformation
us
banish
these
reflections
my
dear
more
exclaimed
the
king
in
a
petulant
tone
passing
his
hand
across
his
forehead
distress
me
and
i
prefer
a
change
of
saying
this
he
arose
and
putting
his
arm
around
sir
neck
they
walked
on
together
toward
the
extremity
of
the
garden
which
terminated
in
an
extensive
and
beautiful
terrace
at
the
foot
of
which
flowed
the
waters
of
the
thames
the
view
was
an
extended
one
and
the
king
amused
himself
watching
the
rapid
movements
of
the
little
boats
filled
with
fishermen
rowing
in
every
direction
drawing
in
the
nets
which
had
been
spread
to
dry
on
the
reeds
covering
the
banks
of
the
river
quantities
of
blue
flowers
floating
on
their
large
brilliant
green
leaves
intermingled
with
the
dark
bending
heads
of
the
reeds
presenting
to
the
distant
observer
the
appearance
of
a
beautiful
variegated
carpet
of
flowers
a
charming
scene
said
the
king
gazing
at
the
prospect
and
pointing
to
a
boat
just
approaching
the
opposite
side
of
the
river
to
land
a
troop
of
young
villagers
who
with
their
bright
steel
sickles
in
hand
were
returning
from
the
harvest
fields
the
graceful
spire
of
your
chelsea
belfry
gleaming
in
the
distance
through
the
light
silvery
clouds
completes
this
charming
landscape
he
added
it
were
possible
to
transport
this
view
to
the
end
of
one
of
my
drives
in
park
continued
the
king
it
be
very
soon
completed
asked
sir
thomas
at
a
loss
what
to
say
to
his
royal
visitor
hope
so
replied
henry
languidly
these
architects
are
so
very
slow
before
going
to
grafton
i
gave
them
numerous
orders
on
the
majesty
has
been
quite
pleased
with
your
journey
i
believe
replied
sir
thomas
instantly
reflecting
what
he
should
say
next
should
have
been
extremely
well
pleased
he
answered
with
a
sudden
impatience
of
manner
wolsey
not
persisted
so
obstinately
in
following
me
i
have
been
much
too
indulgent
he
continued
sharply
too
indulgent
towards
him
and
am
now
well
convinced
of
the
mistake
i
have
made
in
retaining
the
slightest
affection
for
a
man
who
has
so
miserably
deceived
me
what
would
you
think
more
he
continued
his
manner
suddenly
changing
i
appointed
you
in
his
place
as
lord
chancellor
and
turning
towards
sir
thomas
he
gazed
fixedly
in
his
eyes
as
if
to
read
the
inmost
emotions
of
his
soul
would
i
think
answered
more
calmly
then
adding
with
a
careless
smile
should
think
your
majesty
had
done
a
very
wrong
thing
and
made
a
very
bad
i
believe
i
could
not
possibly
make
a
better
said
the
king
emphasizing
the
last
words
i
have
not
come
here
to
discuss
business
matters
rather
on
the
contrary
to
get
rid
of
them
come
then
entertain
me
with
something
more
but
the
words
designedly
though
with
seeming
unconcern
uttered
by
the
king
cast
a
sudden
gloom
over
the
spirit
of
sir
thomas
he
vainly
endeavored
to
dispel
your
majesty
is
greatly
mistaken
in
entertaining
such
an
idea
he
said
stammering
and
confused
for
with
his
sincere
and
truthful
nature
more
under
all
circumstances
resolutely
looked
to
the
end
of
everything
in
which
he
suspected
the
least
dissimulation
the
king
whirled
round
on
his
heel
pretending
not
to
hear
him
is
a
beautiful
rose
he
said
stooping
down
very
beautiful
variety
come
from
the
seed
no
doubt
are
you
a
gardener
i
am
very
fond
of
flowers
oh
my
garden
will
be
said
more
still
pursuing
his
subject
must
have
a
cutting
of
that
rose
do
you
hear
me
more
as
he
ran
on
in
this
manner
to
prevent
sir
thomas
from
speaking
the
silvery
notes
of
a
bell
were
heard
filling
the
air
with
a
sweet
and
prolonged
vibrating
sound
bell
is
that
asked
the
king
bell
of
our
chapel
sire
replied
more
us
to
evening
prayers
which
we
usually
prefer
saying
all
together
but
your
majesty
having
honored
us
with
a
visit
there
will
be
no
obligation
to
answer
the
all
means
replied
henry
me
interfere
with
nothing
it
is
almost
night
come
we
will
return
and
i
will
join
in
your
sir
thomas
conducted
him
through
the
shrubbery
towards
the
chapel
a
venerable
structure
in
the
style
of
architecture
a
thick
undergrowth
of
briers
brambles
and
wild
shrubbery
was
matted
and
interlaced
around
the
foundation
of
the
building
running
vines
clambered
over
the
heavy
arches
of
the
antique
windows
and
fell
back
in
waving
garlands
upon
the
climbing
branches
from
which
they
had
sprung
the
walls
of
rough
unhewn
stone
were
thickly
covered
with
moss
and
ivy
giving
the
little
structure
an
appearance
of
such
antiquity
that
the
most
scrupulous
antiquarian
would
have
unhesitatingly
referred
its
foundation
to
the
time
of
king
athelstan
or
his
brother
edmund
the
interior
was
adorned
with
extreme
care
and
taste
a
bronze
lamp
suspended
before
the
altar
illuminated
a
statue
of
the
holy
virgin
placed
above
it
the
children
of
sir
thomas
with
the
servants
of
his
household
were
ranged
in
respectful
silence
behind
the
of
his
aged
father
margaret
knelt
beside
him
with
her
waiting
to
begin
the
devotions
the
touching
voice
of
this
young
girl
as
she
slowly
repeated
the
sublime
words
father
who
art
in
those
words
which
men
may
so
joyfully
pronounce
which
teach
us
the
exalted
dignity
of
our
being
the
grandeur
of
our
origin
and
destiny
those
sublime
words
penetrated
the
soul
of
the
king
with
a
profound
and
singular
emotion
a
happy
family
he
exclaimed
mentally
disturbs
their
harmony
day
after
day
passes
without
leaving
a
regret
behind
it
why
can
i
not
join
in
this
sweet
prayer
why
o
my
soul
hast
thou
banished
and
forgotten
it
he
turned
from
the
contemplation
of
these
youthful
heads
bowed
before
the
mother
of
god
and
a
wave
of
bitter
remorse
swept
once
again
over
his
hardened
hypocritical
soul
after
the
king
had
returned
to
his
royal
palace
and
the
evening
repast
was
ended
william
roper
approached
sir
thomas
and
said
must
consider
yourself
most
fortunate
my
dear
father
in
enjoying
so
intimately
the
favor
of
his
majesty
why
even
cardinal
wolsey
can
not
boast
of
being
honored
with
such
a
degree
of
friendship
and
with
a
sad
smile
more
taking
the
young
hand
replied
my
son
i
can
never
be
elated
by
it
if
this
head
around
which
he
passed
his
royal
arm
so
affectionately
this
evening
could
in
falling
pay
the
price
of
but
one
single
inch
of
french
territory
he
would
without
a
hesitation
deliver
it
up
to
the
acknowledgments
do
i
not
owe
you
madam
said
sir
thomas
cheney
to
lady
anne
boleyn
the
services
you
have
rendered
me
but
dare
i
hope
for
a
full
pardon
from
the
king
perfectly
secure
on
that
point
replied
lady
anne
is
convinced
that
wolsey
had
you
banished
from
court
because
of
your
disagreement
with
cardinal
campeggio
and
he
considers
you
now
one
of
his
most
faithful
i
hope
madam
to
have
the
happiness
of
proving
to
you
that
i
am
none
the
less
faithfully
your
servant
replied
sir
thomas
cheney
must
admit
now
said
lady
anne
addressing
her
father
and
brother
the
earl
of
wiltshire
and
the
viscount
rochford
who
were
both
present
i
succeed
in
doing
what
i
succeed
in
what
you
undertake
replied
her
father
humorously
you
are
a
long
time
in
deciding
what
to
do
for
instance
cardinal
wolsey
finds
himself
occupying
a
position
in
which
he
has
no
right
to
well
he
will
not
remain
in
it
very
long
replied
anne
boleyn
petulantly
morning
the
king
told
me
the
ladies
would
attend
the
chase
to
see
the
new
falcons
the
king
of
france
has
sent
him
by
monsieur
de
sansac
i
will
talk
to
him
and
insist
on
his
having
nothing
more
to
do
with
this
horrid
cardinal
or
i
shall
at
once
quit
the
court
but
she
added
pausing
suddenly
with
an
expression
of
extreme
embarrassment
should
i
answer
were
he
to
demand
what
his
eminence
monseigneur
wolsey
had
ever
done
to
sister
here
is
your
answer
replied
viscount
rochford
taking
a
large
manuscript
book
from
his
portfolio
it
and
read
for
yourself
you
will
find
here
all
you
would
need
for
a
great
book
cried
anne
strongly
opposed
to
this
new
commission
and
pouting
like
a
spoilt
child
taking
the
book
she
read
skipping
a
great
deal
however
a
minutely
detailed
statement
formally
accusing
wolsey
of
having
engaged
in
a
secret
correspondence
with
france
and
with
the
most
adroit
malice
misrepresenting
every
act
of
his
administration
as
well
as
of
his
private
life
can
all
this
be
true
cried
anne
boleyn
closing
the
book
true
replied
rochford
furthermore
you
should
know
the
cardinal
in
order
to
reward
campeggio
for
the
good
services
he
has
rendered
has
persuaded
the
king
to
send
him
home
loaded
with
rich
presents
to
conciliate
the
pope
he
says
by
his
filial
submission
and
pious
dispositions
and
incline
him
to
a
favorable
decision
that
is
the
way
he
manages
continued
rochford
shrugging
his
shoulders
keeps
you
in
the
most
humiliating
position
ever
occupied
by
a
hearing
her
brother
speak
thus
the
beautiful
face
of
anne
boleyn
became
instantly
suffused
with
a
deep
crimson
that
odious
man
she
cried
passionately
shall
no
longer
submit
to
it
it
is
to
insult
me
he
makes
such
gracious
acknowledgments
to
that
old
cardinal
i
will
complain
to
the
king
oh
how
annoying
all
this
is
though
and
she
turned
the
book
over
and
over
in
her
white
hands
see
it
is
time
to
start
she
added
pointing
to
a
great
clock
standing
in
one
corner
of
the
apartment
i
must
go
and
anne
attired
in
an
elegant
abruptly
turning
to
a
mirror
proceeded
to
adjust
her
black
velvet
when
observing
a
small
plume
in
her
hat
that
was
not
arranged
to
her
taste
she
exclaimed
violently
stamping
her
little
foot
many
contradictions
shall
i
meet
this
day
i
can
not
endure
it
all
those
horrid
affairs
to
think
of
to
talk
about
and
explain
all
your
recommendations
to
follow
in
the
midst
of
a
delightful
hunting
party
and
then
after
all
this
hat
which
so
provokes
me
no
i
can
never
fix
and
she
hurried
away
to
find
a
woman
skilled
in
the
arts
of
the
toilet
but
after
making
her
sew
and
rip
out
again
bend
the
plume
and
straighten
it
place
it
forward
and
then
back
she
did
not
succeed
in
fixing
it
to
suit
the
fancy
of
anne
boleyn
who
seeing
the
time
flying
rapidly
ended
by
cutting
off
the
plume
with
the
scissors
throwing
it
angrily
on
the
floor
and
stamping
it
putting
the
offending
cap
on
her
head
without
a
plume
then
mounting
her
horse
she
rode
off
accompanied
by
sir
thomas
cheney
who
escorted
her
knowing
she
was
to
join
the
king
on
the
road
impulsive
and
thoughtless
your
sister
is
said
earl
wiltshire
to
his
son
after
anne
had
left
them
looking
gloomily
at
the
plume
still
lying
on
the
floor
where
she
had
thrown
it
wants
to
be
queen
do
you
understand
how
much
is
comprised
in
that
word
well
she
would
accept
a
crown
and
fix
it
on
her
head
with
the
same
eager
interest
that
she
would
order
a
new
bonnet
from
her
milliner
yet
i
firmly
believe
before
accepting
it
she
would
have
to
be
well
assured
by
her
mirror
that
it
was
becoming
to
her
style
of
can
not
comprehend
her
responded
rochford
good
sense
and
judgment
sometimes
astonish
me
then
suddenly
a
ball
a
dress
a
new
fashion
has
sufficed
to
make
her
forget
the
most
important
matter
that
might
be
under
discussion
i
am
oftentimes
led
to
wonder
whence
comes
this
singular
mixture
of
frivolity
and
good
sense
in
women
is
it
a
peculiarity
of
their
nature
or
the
result
of
education
is
entirely
the
fault
of
education
my
son
and
not
of
their
weakness
from
infancy
they
are
taught
to
look
upon
ribbons
laces
frivolities
and
fashions
as
the
most
precious
and
desirable
things
in
fact
they
attach
to
these
miserable
trifles
the
same
value
that
young
men
place
on
a
brilliant
armor
or
the
success
of
a
glorious
may
be
so
replied
rochford
i
think
they
are
generally
found
as
incompetent
for
business
as
incapable
of
managing
affairs
of
very
young
perhaps
not
answered
wiltshire
and
impulsive
they
are
neither
capable
of
nor
inclined
to
dissimulation
but
later
in
life
they
develop
a
subtle
ingenuity
and
an
extreme
degree
of
penetration
that
enable
them
to
succeed
most
well
if
the
truth
might
be
frankly
expressed
i
greatly
fear
that
all
this
will
turn
out
badly
should
we
not
succeed
in
espousing
my
sister
to
the
king
she
will
be
irretrievably
compromised
and
then
you
will
deeply
regret
having
broken
off
her
marriage
with
lord
talk
like
an
idiot
replied
the
earl
of
wiltshire
sister
shall
reign
or
i
perish
why
should
my
house
not
give
a
queen
to
the
throne
of
england
would
it
not
be
far
better
if
our
kings
should
select
wives
from
the
nobility
of
their
country
instead
of
marrying
foreign
princesses
strangers
alike
to
the
manners
and
customs
as
well
as
to
the
interests
of
the
people
over
whom
they
are
destined
to
reign
would
probably
be
right
replied
viscount
rochford
the
king
were
not
already
married
but
the
clergy
will
always
oppose
this
second
marriage
they
do
not
dare
to
express
themselves
openly
because
they
fear
the
king
but
in
the
end
they
will
certainly
preserve
the
nation
in
this
sentiment
i
fear
that
anne
will
yet
be
very
unhappy
and
i
am
truly
sorry
now
she
can
not
be
made
countess
of
your
tongue
my
son
cried
wiltshire
frantic
with
rage
you
repeat
these
things
to
your
sister
and
renew
her
imaginary
regrets
also
as
to
these
churchmen
over
whom
you
make
so
great
an
ado
he
continued
with
a
menacing
gesture
hope
soon
we
shall
be
able
to
relieve
them
of
the
fortunes
with
which
they
are
encumbered
and
compel
them
to
disgorge
in
our
favor
you
say
that
women
are
weak
and
fickle
if
so
you
certainly
resemble
them
in
both
respects
the
least
difficulty
frightens
you
into
changing
your
opinions
and
you
hesitate
in
the
midst
of
an
undertaking
that
has
been
planned
with
the
greatest
ability
and
which
without
you
i
confidently
believe
i
shall
be
able
to
to
be
continued
is
she
catholic
the
claim
put
forth
by
the
episcopal
church
or
to
use
her
full
and
legal
title
the
protestant
episcopal
church
of
the
united
slates
of
america
of
being
the
holy
catholic
church
holy
catholic
and
apostolic
and
the
acceptance
of
her
theory
by
a
small
portion
of
the
christian
world
makes
her
and
her
theory
for
a
little
time
worthy
our
attention
she
is
accustomed
to
use
the
formula
believe
in
the
holy
catholic
it
is
but
natural
to
infer
that
she
considers
herself
to
be
at
least
an
integral
part
of
that
church
we
have
examined
the
question
and
thus
present
our
convictions
as
to
her
status
we
note
in
the
first
place
that
her
bishops
possess
no
power
they
are
bishops
but
in
name
there
is
not
one
of
them
no
matter
how
eminent
he
may
be
who
can
say
to
a
clergyman
in
his
diocese
is
an
important
parish
vacant
occupy
he
would
be
met
with
the
polite
remark
from
some
member
of
the
parish
are
very
much
obliged
to
you
bishop
but
you
have
nothing
to
say
about
it
is
the
the
warden
may
be
and
in
many
instances
is
a
man
who
cares
so
little
about
the
church
that
he
has
never
yet
been
baptized
much
less
is
he
a
communicant
he
and
his
brother
vestrymen
whether
baptized
or
not
may
if
the
bishop
claims
an
authority
by
virtue
of
his
office
meet
him
at
the
church
door
and
tell
him
he
can
not
come
in
unless
he
will
pledge
himself
to
do
as
they
wish
and
the
bishop
may
write
a
note
of
protest
and
leave
it
behind
him
for
them
to
tear
up
as
was
done
in
chicago
with
bishop
whitehouse
some
local
regulations
have
occasionally
varied
the
above
but
in
the
majority
of
parishes
the
authority
is
vested
as
we
have
stated
the
power
of
appointing
extends
to
none
but
feeble
missionary
stations
and
even
these
put
on
at
their
earliest
convenience
the
airs
of
parishes
we
note
an
instance
where
a
bishop
wrote
to
a
lady
in
a
remote
missionary
station
and
asked
regarding
some
funds
which
had
been
placed
in
her
hands
by
parties
interested
in
the
growth
of
the
church
in
that
place
it
had
been
specified
that
the
money
was
to
be
used
for
whatever
purpose
was
deemed
most
necessary
the
bishop
requested
that
the
money
be
paid
to
the
missionary
toward
his
salary
the
lady
declined
on
the
ground
that
she
did
not
like
the
missionary
another
request
in
courteous
language
as
was
befitting
a
bishop
he
also
stated
his
intention
of
visiting
the
place
shortly
in
his
official
character
the
reply
equalled
his
own
in
courteous
phraseology
but
the
money
was
refused
and
the
bishop
informed
that
he
not
trouble
himself
about
making
a
visitation
as
there
was
no
class
to
be
confirmed
besides
the
church
had
been
closed
for
repairs
and
would
not
be
open
for
some
months
at
least
not
until
a
new
minister
was
to
the
positive
knowledge
no
repairs
were
needed
but
he
deemed
it
wise
to
stay
away
and
no
further
steps
were
taken
with
the
clergy
in
his
diocese
the
case
is
not
very
different
if
a
presbyter
of
any
diocese
chooses
for
any
reason
to
go
from
one
parish
to
another
for
the
purpose
of
taking
up
a
permanent
abode
he
can
do
so
with
or
without
consulting
his
bishop
in
fact
the
bishop
has
nothing
to
do
with
it
should
the
presbyter
desire
to
remove
to
another
diocese
it
is
requisite
that
he
obtain
letters
dimissory
from
the
bishop
and
the
bishop
is
obliged
to
give
them
so
also
is
the
bishop
in
the
diocese
to
which
he
goes
obliged
to
receive
them
unless
they
contain
grave
criminal
charges
there
is
in
reality
but
one
thing
the
bishop
of
the
protestant
episcopal
church
can
do
and
that
is
make
an
appointment
once
in
three
years
to
confirm
so
insignificant
is
his
power
in
any
other
direction
that
certain
persons
or
otherwise
have
fastened
upon
him
whether
deserved
or
undeserved
the
name
of
certain
it
is
that
were
the
power
of
confirming
in
any
degree
vested
in
the
of
the
church
the
office
of
bishop
might
easily
be
dispensed
with
he
would
appear
only
as
the
ornamental
portion
of
a
few
occasional
services
for
he
can
not
authoritatively
visit
any
parish
vacant
or
otherwise
except
on
a
confirmation
tour
and
should
this
be
too
frequent
in
the
estimation
of
the
vestry
the
doors
of
the
church
could
be
shut
against
him
on
any
plea
the
vestry
should
choose
to
advance
he
can
not
increase
the
number
of
his
clergy
except
as
parishes
choose
he
can
not
prevent
a
man
fixing
himself
in
the
diocese
if
a
congregation
choose
to
him
no
matter
how
worthy
or
unworthy
the
man
may
be
he
can
not
call
a
clergyman
into
his
diocese
though
every
parish
were
empty
he
can
not
officiate
in
any
church
without
invitation
he
has
no
church
of
his
own
except
as
he
officiates
as
rector
and
unless
invited
to
some
place
he
is
forced
although
a
bishop
to
sit
in
the
congregation
as
a
layman
if
he
do
not
stay
at
home
and
lastly
he
can
not
on
any
account
visit
a
parish
unless
the
vestry
of
that
parish
is
willing
we
sum
up
that
so
far
as
the
bishops
of
the
protestant
episcopal
church
of
the
united
states
of
america
are
concerned
they
are
simply
ornaments
possessing
the
minimum
of
authority
in
point
of
fact
no
authority
at
all
their
own
convention
addresses
are
a
virtual
confession
of
the
condition
of
affairs
as
above
laid
down
to
every
one
who
has
ever
heard
an
episcopal
address
as
delivered
before
the
annual
convention
of
clergymen
and
laymen
the
following
sample
will
not
appear
as
in
the
least
overdrawn
july
visited
the
parish
of
john
oakdale
and
confirmed
three
july
visited
the
parish
of
longwood
and
preached
and
confirmed
one
july
visited
and
preached
and
confirmed
two
in
the
forenoon
preached
also
in
the
afternoon
this
is
a
very
large
and
thriving
parish
july
at
montrose
i
visited
and
confirmed
one
at
the
evening
service
july
took
a
private
conveyance
to
hillstown
and
preached
in
the
evening
confirmed
one
the
rector
of
this
parish
is
very
energetic
aug
attended
the
burial
of
a
dear
friend
aug
attended
the
consecration
of
church
in
hyde
park
it
is
hoped
that
the
difficulties
in
this
parish
are
settled
the
rev
john
waters
has
resigned
and
gone
to
omaha
william
steuben
is
the
senior
warden
may
the
lord
prosper
him
and
his
estimable
lady
to
continue
the
list
would
cause
a
tear
and
we
do
not
wish
to
weep
the
address
each
year
of
a
protestant
episcopal
bishop
is
thoroughly
exemplified
in
the
foregoing
specimen
it
is
the
same
endless
list
of
varied
only
by
the
number
of
to
the
lazy
it
is
a
most
fascinating
chapter
of
ancient
history
when
he
reaches
the
section
in
the
there
is
an
immense
list
of
them
and
the
lesson
for
that
day
is
easy
when
the
first
phrase
is
mastered
he
knows
all
the
rest
except
the
occasional
figures
we
once
saw
a
reporter
for
a
prominent
daily
making
a
report
of
an
address
before
an
illustrious
diocesan
gathering
having
had
some
experience
in
the
matter
he
came
to
the
meeting
with
his
tablets
prepared
they
were
as
follows
visited
at
and
confirmed
of
the
address
was
thus
prepared
beforehand
it
only
being
necessary
to
leave
the
lines
sufficiently
far
apart
to
permit
the
insertion
of
occasional
notes
by
his
extra
care
he
was
enabled
to
present
the
most
complete
report
of
any
paper
in
the
city
the
specimen
we
have
given
is
a
fair
average
in
future
generations
when
a
classical
student
is
given
a
address
to
read
his
labor
for
that
day
will
be
easy
almost
any
address
will
substantiate
the
statements
we
have
made
we
refer
to
them
freely
without
wasting
time
in
selection
we
begin
a
new
paragraph
the
system
of
the
protestant
episcopal
church
is
eminently
congregational
if
a
parish
chooses
to
a
given
man
he
is
should
the
bishop
and
recommend
him
the
recommendation
without
an
exception
that
has
ever
come
to
our
knowledge
militates
against
the
proposed
should
a
parish
desire
to
get
rid
of
a
pastor
it
does
so
with
or
without
the
consent
of
the
bishop
as
happens
in
the
estimation
of
the
wardens
to
be
most
convenient
the
officers
may
consult
the
bishop
and
if
he
agree
with
them
well
and
good
the
words
of
the
diocesan
are
quoted
from
dan
to
beersheba
and
the
pastor
is
made
to
feel
the
lack
of
sympathy
his
bishop
is
against
him
is
whispered
by
young
and
old
if
the
bishop
does
not
agree
with
them
they
do
not
consult
him
again
they
proceed
to
accomplish
what
they
desire
as
if
he
had
no
existence
and
they
always
succeed
there
is
a
farcical
canon
of
the
protestant
episcopal
church
which
says
if
a
parish
dismiss
its
rector
without
concurrence
it
shall
not
be
admitted
into
convention
until
it
has
apologized
it
is
a
very
easy
thing
for
the
wardens
and
vestrymen
to
address
the
convention
after
they
have
accomplished
their
ends
with
honorable
body
thinks
we
have
done
wrong
and
we
are
sorry
for
it
or
something
else
equally
ambiguous
and
absurd
the
officers
of
the
parish
and
the
laymen
of
the
congregation
have
done
what
they
wished
and
are
content
as
the
convention
is
composed
principally
of
laymen
the
sympathy
is
naturally
with
the
side
of
the
question
the
rector
is
hurriedly
passed
over
his
clerical
brethren
looking
helplessly
on
to
get
a
new
parish
the
dismissed
rector
must
a
feature
of
clerical
life
most
revolting
to
any
man
with
a
spark
of
manhood
in
him
we
note
in
the
next
place
an
utter
want
of
unity
in
the
protestant
episcopal
church
there
are
and
bookstores
where
the
publications
of
the
one
are
discarded
by
the
other
there
are
and
seminaries
where
a
man
to
graduate
from
the
one
will
be
looked
upon
inimically
at
least
with
suspicion
by
the
other
there
is
a
for
the
increase
of
the
ministry
where
the
principal
thing
accomplished
is
the
maintenance
of
the
secretary
of
the
said
society
in
a
large
brick
house
in
a
fashionable
city
while
he
claims
to
support
a
few
students
on
two
meals
a
day
and
a
evangelical
society
where
they
require
the
beneficiary
to
subscribe
to
certain
articles
of
before
they
will
receive
him
the
one
society
is
thoroughly
hostile
to
the
other
and
in
point
of
fact
the
latter
was
created
in
opposition
to
the
former
there
is
but
one
thing
in
common
between
the
two
and
that
is
there
are
and
newspapers
in
which
the
epithets
used
by
the
one
toward
the
other
do
not
indicate
even
some
of
the
ministers
would
no
more
enter
a
place
of
worship
than
they
would
put
their
hand
in
the
fire
others
will
fraternize
with
everything
and
everybody
and
when
sunday
comes
will
close
their
eyes
sometimes
they
roll
them
upward
and
pray
publicly
heresy
and
schism
good
lord
deliver
it
may
be
necessary
that
there
should
be
wranglings
and
bickerings
within
her
fold
in
order
to
constitute
her
the
church
militant
but
we
can
not
forgive
hypocrisy
with
some
of
her
ministers
the
grand
object
of
existence
seems
to
be
to
prove
an
emanation
from
hell
with
others
the
effort
is
equally
great
to
prove
the
episcopal
church
as
a
branch
with
the
roman
church
and
entitled
to
the
same
consideration
as
is
paid
by
the
devotees
of
rome
to
its
hierarchy
in
both
instances
high
church
and
low
church
history
records
failure
we
notice
next
the
relation
which
the
protestant
episcopal
church
holds
to
the
church
of
england
the
english
church
evidently
regards
the
protestant
episcopal
church
of
the
united
states
of
america
as
a
weaker
sister
and
not
to
be
admitted
to
doubtful
disputations
she
is
courteous
toward
her
and
accepts
her
present
of
a
gold
from
an
unrobed
representative
with
a
certain
amount
of
ceremony
she
invites
her
bishops
to
the
lambeth
conference
and
they
pay
their
own
fare
across
the
atlantic
but
they
confer
about
nothing
it
is
true
the
protestant
episcopal
church
approved
the
action
of
the
english
church
in
condemning
colenso
but
this
was
a
safe
thing
for
the
english
church
to
present
it
would
have
been
hardly
complimentary
to
have
their
guests
go
home
without
doing
something
especially
as
they
were
not
to
be
invited
into
westminster
abbey
and
were
to
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
coming
bible
revision
the
bishops
of
the
protestant
episcopal
church
of
the
united
states
of
america
were
invited
to
the
english
conference
very
much
as
country
cousins
are
invited
to
tea
and
that
was
all
by
way
of
asserting
her
right
to
a
recognition
as
an
equal
with
the
church
of
england
she
the
protestant
episcopal
church
of
the
united
states
of
america
has
established
or
rather
individuals
have
established
and
the
act
has
received
the
sanction
of
the
general
convention
certain
rival
congregations
in
a
few
foreign
cities
where
the
english
service
was
already
established
if
she
be
of
the
same
catholic
mould
as
the
church
of
england
why
does
she
thus
in
a
foreign
city
attempt
to
maintain
an
opposition
service
the
variations
in
the
are
no
answer
to
the
question
if
the
english
church
be
holy
catholic
and
apostolic
and
the
protestant
episcopal
church
be
holy
catholic
and
apostolic
the
two
are
therefore
one
for
they
both
claim
that
there
is
but
one
holy
catholic
and
apostolic
church
she
is
in
this
case
unmistakably
uncatholic
or
else
the
english
church
is
in
either
case
she
falls
to
the
ground
our
attention
is
directed
again
to
the
many
laws
enacted
against
her
bishops
as
compared
with
the
laws
enacted
against
the
other
members
of
the
church
if
mosheim
were
to
be
restored
to
the
flesh
and
were
to
write
the
history
of
the
episcopal
church
and
used
as
an
authority
the
digest
of
canons
as
he
has
been
accustomed
in
his
to
use
ecclesiastical
documents
generally
he
would
style
the
bishops
of
the
protestant
episcopal
church
a
set
of
criminals
of
the
deepest
dye
and
the
priests
and
deacons
not
much
better
the
laity
would
be
regarded
as
all
that
could
be
desired
in
lofty
integrity
and
spotless
morality
for
why
a
glance
at
their
of
law
the
digest
of
canons
shows
an
immense
bulk
of
its
space
to
be
devoted
the
trial
of
a
the
laity
go
we
question
the
propriety
as
well
as
the
catholicity
of
covering
the
higher
clergy
with
laws
till
they
are
helpless
while
the
laity
revel
in
a
freedom
that
amounts
when
they
choose
to
but
it
is
done
and
the
episcopal
church
is
degraded
to
a
level
lower
than
any
of
the
denominations
around
her
with
other
bodies
who
call
themselves
christian
there
is
a
certain
amount
of
consistency
their
rulers
are
from
among
their
own
members
with
the
church
under
consideration
her
rulers
in
many
cases
are
any
unbaptized
heathen
who
may
choose
to
work
themselves
into
a
temporary
favor
with
the
it
is
not
necessary
that
they
should
even
have
ever
attended
church
we
note
an
instance
where
the
chief
man
of
a
small
parish
was
a
druggist
and
kept
in
the
rear
of
his
a
low
and
this
man
was
elected
treasurer
year
after
year
by
a
handful
of
interested
parties
and
when
elected
he
managed
all
the
finances
of
the
parish
according
to
his
own
notions
of
propriety
it
was
his
habit
to
go
to
the
church
near
the
close
of
the
sermon
and
go
away
immediately
after
the
collection
we
note
another
instance
where
a
warden
visited
the
rector
of
his
parish
and
threatened
with
a
polite
oath
to
give
him
something
hotter
than
a
section
of
the
day
of
judgment
if
he
did
not
ask
his
the
advice
a
little
more
on
parish
matters
the
parish
grew
so
warm
that
at
the
end
of
three
weeks
the
rector
was
candidating
for
another
we
note
another
instance
where
a
warden
was
so
overjoyed
at
having
settled
a
rector
according
to
his
own
liking
that
on
the
arrival
of
the
new
incumbent
he
not
only
did
not
go
to
hear
him
preach
but
stayed
at
home
with
certain
friends
and
enjoyed
to
use
his
own
expression
a
big
out
of
consideration
for
the
feelings
of
his
family
we
use
the
word
instead
of
his
stronger
expression
the
rector
of
this
parish
was
imprudent
enough
to
incur
the
displeasure
of
his
warden
after
a
few
months
of
arduous
labor
he
received
a
note
while
sitting
at
the
bedside
of
his
sick
wife
saying
that
after
the
following
sunday
his
services
would
be
dispensed
with
that
if
he
attempted
to
stay
the
church
would
be
closed
for
repairs
we
are
well
acquainted
with
a
parish
where
a
congregation
wished
to
displace
both
the
senior
and
junior
wardens
these
two
gentlemen
had
been
shrewd
enough
to
foresee
the
event
they
succeeded
by
calculating
management
in
having
vested
in
themselves
the
right
of
selling
pews
when
easter
monday
came
they
sold
for
a
dollar
a
pew
to
loafers
on
the
streets
and
swarmed
the
election
with
men
who
never
had
entered
the
place
before
the
laws
of
the
parish
were
such
that
there
was
no
redress
as
a
matter
of
course
the
rector
was
soon
candidating
during
the
earliest
portion
of
the
official
life
of
one
of
the
oldest
and
most
eminent
bishops
he
was
called
on
to
officiate
at
the
institution
of
a
rector
at
the
morning
service
the
bishop
took
occasion
to
congratulate
the
congregation
on
the
assumed
fact
that
they
had
now
altar
a
priest
and
a
sacrifice
and
went
on
to
enlarge
on
that
idea
in
the
evening
of
the
same
day
the
instituted
minister
in
addressing
the
congregation
said
brethren
so
help
me
god
if
the
doctrines
you
heard
this
morning
are
the
doctrines
of
the
protestant
episcopal
church
then
i
am
no
protestant
episcopalian
but
they
are
not
and
essayed
substantiating
the
assertion
all
that
came
of
the
affair
was
the
publication
on
the
part
of
each
of
their
respective
discourses
on
the
supposition
of
the
having
any
foundation
for
his
ecclesiastical
character
and
for
the
doctrines
he
taught
would
that
have
been
the
end
of
the
matter
can
it
be
that
the
episcopal
church
is
catholic
is
it
possible
that
she
is
part
of
the
grand
structure
portrayed
by
prophets
and
sung
in
the
matchless
words
of
inspiration
as
that
against
which
the
gates
of
hell
shall
not
prevail
rather
we
are
forced
to
class
her
as
a
among
the
very
from
whom
in
her
litany
she
prays
lord
deliver
are
you

wife

november
had
come
and
was
gathering
up
the
last
tints
and
blossoms
of
autumn
one
by
one
the
garden
lights
were
being
put
out
the
tall
archangel
lilies
drooped
their
snow
and
gold
cups
languidly
the
jasmine
that
only
the
other
day
twinkled
its
silver
stars
amidst
the
purple
bells
of
the
clematis
now
trailed
wearily
down
the
trellis
of
the
porch
the
hardy
geraniums
made
a
stand
for
it
yet
but
their
petals
dropped
off
at
every
puff
of
wind
and
powdered
the
gravel
with
a
scarlet
ring
round
their
six
big
red
pots
that
flanked
the
walk
from
the
gate
to
the
cottage
door
the
red
roses
held
out
like
a
forlorn
hope
defying
the
approach
of
the
conqueror
and
staying
to
say
a
last
to
sweet
mother
summer
ere
she
passed
away
it
was
too
chilly
to
sit
out
of
doors
late
of
afternoons
now
and
night
fell
quickly
de
la
bourbonais
had
collapsed
into
his
brown
den
but
the
window
stood
open
and
let
the
faint
incense
of
the
garden
steal
in
to
him
as
he
bent
over
his
desk
with
his
shaded
lamp
beside
him
franceline
had
found
it
cold
and
had
slipt
away
without
saying
why
to
her
own
room
upstairs
she
was
sitting
on
the
floor
with
her
hands
in
her
lap
and
her
head
pressed
against
the
latticed
window
watching
the
scarlet
geraniums
as
they
shivered
in
the
evening
breeze
and
dropped
into
their
moist
autumn
tomb
a
large
crystal
moon
was
rising
above
the
woods
beyond
the
river
and
a
few
stars
were
coming
out
she
counted
them
and
listened
to
the
cooing
in
the
park
and
to
the
solitary
note
of
an
owl
that
answered
from
some
distant
grove
but
the
voices
of
wood
and
field
were
not
to
her
now
what
they
once
had
been
there
was
something
in
her
that
responded
to
them
still
but
not
in
the
old
way
she
had
drifted
somewhere
beyond
their
reach
she
was
hearkening
for
other
voices
since
one
had
touched
her
with
a
power
these
had
never
possessed
and
whose
echoing
sweetness
had
converted
the
sounds
that
had
till
then
been
her
only
music
into
a
blank
and
aching
silence
other
pulses
had
been
stirred
other
chords
struck
within
her
so
strong
and
deep
and
unlike
the
old
childish
ones
that
these
had
become
to
her
what
the
memory
of
the
joys
of
childhood
are
to
the
man
a
sweet
shadow
that
lingers
when
the
substance
has
fled
part
of
a
life
that
has
been
lived
that
can
never
be
quickened
again
but
is
enshrined
in
memory
she
was
very
pale
almost
like
a
shadow
herself
as
she
sat
there
in
the
silver
gloom
mothers
who
met
her
in
her
walks
about
the
neighborhood
looked
wistfully
after
the
gentle
young
face
and
said
with
a
sigh
a
pity
and
so
young
too
yet
franceline
was
not
ill
not
even
ailing
she
never
complained
even
of
fatigue
and
when
her
father
tapped
the
pale
cheek
and
asked
how
his
was
she
would
answer
brightly
that
she
had
never
been
better
in
her
life
and
as
she
had
no
cough
he
believed
her
a
cough
was
single
diagnosis
of
disease
and
death
he
had
a
vague
but
belief
that
nobody
no
young
person
certainly
ever
died
a
natural
death
without
this
fatal
premonitory
symptom
and
yet
he
could
not
help
following
franceline
with
an
anxious
eye
as
he
saw
her
walking
listlessly
about
the
garden
or
sitting
with
a
book
in
her
hand
that
she
let
drop
every
now
and
then
to
look
dreamily
out
of
the
window
and
only
resumed
with
an
evident
effort
sometimes
she
would
go
and
lean
her
arms
on
the
rail
at
the
end
of
the
garden
and
stand
there
for
an
hour
together
gazing
at
the
familiar
landscape
as
if
she
were
discovering
some
new
feature
in
it
or
straining
her
eyes
to
see
some
distant
object
he
could
not
lay
his
finger
on
any
particular
symptom
that
justified
anxiety
and
still
he
was
anxious
a
change
of
some
sort
had
come
over
the
child
she
grew
more
and
more
like
her
mother
and
it
was
not
until
armengarde
was
several
years
older
than
franceline
that
the
disease
which
had
been
germinating
in
her
system
from
childhood
developed
itself
and
proved
fatal
de
la
bourbonais
never
alluded
to
refusal
of
sir
ponsonby
anwyll
but
he
had
not
forgotten
it
in
his
dreamy
mind
he
cogitated
on
the
possibility
of
the
offer
being
renewed
and
her
accepting
it
as
to
clide
de
winton
he
had
quite
ceased
to
think
of
him
and
never
for
an
instant
coupled
him
in
his
thoughts
with
franceline
it
did
not
strike
him
as
significant
that
sir
simon
had
avoided
mentioning
the
young
man
since
his
return
after
the
conversation
that
clide
had
once
been
the
subject
of
between
them
this
reticence
was
natural
enough
the
failure
of
his
wild
affectionate
scheme
placed
him
in
a
somewhat
ridiculous
position
towards
raymond
and
it
was
no
wonder
that
he
shrank
from
alluding
to
it
sir
ponsonby
had
left
rydal
immediately
after
the
eventful
ride
we
know
of
he
could
not
remain
in
neighborhood
without
seeing
her
and
he
had
sense
enough
to
feel
that
he
would
injure
rather
than
serve
his
cause
by
forcing
his
society
on
her
after
what
had
passed
this
is
as
good
as
admitting
that
he
did
not
look
upon
his
cause
as
lost
what
man
in
love
for
the
first
time
would
give
up
after
one
refusal
if
his
love
was
worth
the
name
ponsonby
was
not
one
of
the
tribe
he
combined
real
modesty
as
to
his
own
worth
and
pretensions
with
unbounded
faith
in
the
power
of
his
love
and
its
ultimate
success
the
infallibility
of
hope
and
perseverance
was
an
essential
part
of
his
creed
he
did
not
apply
the
tenet
with
any
special
sense
of
its
fitness
to
franceline
in
particular
he
was
no
analyzer
of
character
he
did
not
discriminate
nicely
between
the
wants
and
attributes
of
one
woman
and
another
he
blended
them
all
in
a
theoretical
worship
and
included
all
womankind
in
his
notions
as
to
how
they
were
individually
to
be
wooed
and
won
he
would
let
them
have
their
own
way
allow
them
unlimited
cover
them
with
trinkets
and
gratify
all
their
little
whims
if
a
girl
were
ever
so
beautiful
and
ever
so
good
no
man
could
do
more
for
her
than
this
and
any
man
who
was
able
and
willing
to
do
it
ought
to
be
able
to
win
her
ponsonby
took
heart
and
trusted
to
his
uniform
good
luck
not
to
miss
the
prize
he
had
set
his
heart
on
he
would
rejoin
his
regiment
for
the
present
and
see
what
a
absence
would
do
for
him
he
had
one
certain
ground
of
hope
franceline
did
not
dislike
him
and
as
far
as
he
could
learn
or
guess
she
cared
for
no
one
else
sir
simon
was
his
ally
and
would
keep
a
sharp
lookout
for
him
and
keep
the
little
spark
alive
if
spark
there
were
by
singing
his
praises
judiciously
in
the
ear
of
the
cruel
fair
one
she
meanwhile
went
on
in
her
usual
quiet
routine
tending
the
sick
teaching
some
little
children
and
working
with
her
father
who
grew
daily
more
enamored
of
her
tender
and
intelligent
lady
anwyll
called
soon
after
departure
and
was
just
as
kind
and
unconstrained
as
if
nothing
had
happened
she
did
not
press
franceline
to
go
and
stay
at
rydal
but
hoped
she
would
ride
over
there
occasionally
with
sir
simon
to
lunch
her
duties
as
secretary
to
raymond
made
the
sacrifice
of
a
whole
afternoon
repugnant
to
her
but
she
did
go
once
just
to
show
the
old
lady
that
she
retained
the
same
kind
feeling
towards
her
as
before
anything
had
occurred
to
make
a
break
in
their
intimacy
it
was
delightful
when
she
came
home
to
find
that
her
father
had
been
utterly
at
sea
without
her
mooning
about
in
a
helpless
way
amongst
the
notes
and
papers
that
under
her
management
had
passed
from
confusion
and
chaos
into
order
and
sequence
while
everything
was
in
confusion
he
could
find
his
way
through
the
maze
but
he
had
no
key
to
this
new
order
of
things
franceline
declared
she
must
never
leave
him
so
long
again
he
had
put
everything
he
was
not
to
be
trusted
the
discovery
of
his
dependence
on
her
in
a
sphere
where
she
had
till
lately
been
as
useless
to
him
as
angélique
or
miss
merrywig
was
a
source
of
infinite
enjoyment
to
her
and
she
threw
herself
into
her
daily
task
with
an
energy
that
lightened
the
labor
immensely
to
her
father
without
as
far
as
franceline
could
say
fatiguing
herself
but
fatigue
for
being
unconscious
is
sometimes
none
the
less
real
it
may
be
that
this
sustained
application
was
straining
a
system
already
severely
tried
by
mental
pressure
she
was
one
day
writing
away
as
usual
while
raymond
with
a
bookful
of
notes
in
his
hand
stood
on
the
dictating
suddenly
she
was
seized
with
a
fit
of
coughing
and
putting
her
handkerchief
quickly
to
her
mouth
she
drew
it
away
stained
with
crimson
she
stifled
a
cry
of
terror
that
rose
to
her
lips
and
hurried
out
of
the
room
her
father
had
seen
nothing
but
her
abrupt
departure
startled
him
he
hastened
after
her
and
found
her
in
the
kitchen
holding
the
handkerchief
up
to
angélique
who
was
looking
at
the
fatal
stain
with
a
face
rather
stupefied
than
terrified
god
have
pity
upon
me
my
child
my
child
he
cried
clasping
his
hands
and
abandoning
himself
to
his
distress
with
the
impassioned
demonstrativeness
of
a
frenchman
woman
it
is
said
truly
is
more
courageous
at
bearing
physical
pain
than
man
it
is
true
also
that
she
has
more
in
controlling
the
expression
of
mental
pain
her
instinct
is
surer
too
in
guiding
her
how
to
save
others
from
suffering
let
her
be
ever
so
untutored
she
will
prove
herself
shrewder
than
the
cleverest
man
on
occasions
like
the
present
womanly
instinct
told
her
at
once
that
it
was
essential
not
to
frighten
franceline
that
the
nervous
shock
would
infallibly
aggravate
the
evil
wherever
the
cause
lay
and
that
the
best
thing
to
do
now
was
to
soothe
and
allay
her
fears
me
what
is
there
to
make
a
row
about
she
cried
with
an
angry
chuckle
crushing
the
handkerchief
in
her
fingers
and
darting
a
look
on
her
master
which
if
eyes
could
knock
down
must
have
laid
him
prostrate
on
the
spot
child
has
an
indigestion
and
has
thrown
up
a
mouthful
of
bread
from
her
stomach
hein
do
you
know
it
is
from
the
stomach
and
not
from
the
lungs
he
asked
already
reassured
by
her
confidence
and
still
more
by
her
incivility
do
i
know
am
i
a
fool
would
it
be
that
color
if
it
was
from
the
lungs
i
say
it
is
from
the
stomach
and
it
is
a
good
business
but
we
must
not
have
too
much
of
it
it
would
weaken
the
child
we
must
stop
will
run
for
the
doctor
at
once
exclaimed
de
la
bourbonais
still
trembling
and
excited
stay
no
i
will
fly
to
the
court
and
they
will
despatch
a
man
on
horseback
he
was
hurrying
away
when
angélique
literally
shouted
at
him
thou
be
quiet
with
thy
doctor
and
thy
man
on
horseback
i
tell
thee
it
is
from
the
stomach
i
know
what
i
am
about
i
want
neither
man
nor
horse
it
is
from
the
stomach
dost
thou
take
me
for
a
fool
at
this
time
of
my
life
raymond
stood
still
like
a
chidden
child
while
the
old
servant
poured
this
volley
at
him
franceline
stared
at
her
aghast
in
her
angry
excitement
the
grenadier
had
broken
through
not
only
all
barriers
of
rank
but
all
the
common
rules
of
civility
she
who
was
such
a
strict
observer
of
both
that
they
seemed
a
very
part
of
herself
this
ought
to
have
opened
their
eyes
if
nothing
else
did
but
franceline
was
only
bewildered
raymond
was
cowed
and
perplexed
thou
art
indeed
quite
sure
he
said
falling
into
the
familiar
and
by
which
she
addressed
him
and
which
on
her
deferential
lips
sounded
so
outrageous
and
unnatural
thou
art
indeed
certain
i
will
be
satisfied
but
my
good
angélique
would
it
not
be
a
wise
precaution
to
have
a
medical
man
only
just
as
thou
sayest
well
to
prevent
its
going
too
well
if
monsieur
le
comte
wishes
let
it
be
let
the
doctor
come
for
me
i
care
not
for
him
they
are
an
ignorant
lot
pulling
long
faces
to
make
long
bills
but
if
it
pleases
monsieur
le
comte
let
him
have
one
to
see
the
she
nodded
her
flaps
at
him
as
if
to
say
off
then
at
once
and
leave
us
in
peace
he
was
leaving
the
room
when
turning
round
suddenly
he
came
close
up
to
franceline
thou
feel
a
pain
my
child
he
said
peering
anxiously
into
her
face
father
not
the
least
pain
i
am
sure
angélique
is
right
i
feel
nothing
here
putting
her
hand
to
her
chest
is
good
god
is
good
muttered
the
father
half
audibly
and
stroking
her
cheek
gently
he
went
not
monsieur
le
comte
go
rushing
off
himself
let
him
send
one
of
those
lackeys
at
the
court
cried
angélique
calling
after
him
through
the
kitchen
window
in
her
heart
and
soul
angélique
was
terrified
she
had
thrown
out
quite
at
random
with
the
instinct
of
desperation
that
confident
assurance
as
to
the
color
of
the
stain
her
first
impulse
was
to
save
franceline
from
the
shock
but
it
had
fallen
full
upon
herself
this
accident
sounded
like
the
first
stroke
of
the
no
one
would
have
supposed
it
to
look
at
her
she
set
her
arms
akimbo
and
laughed
till
she
shook
at
her
own
impudence
to
le
comte
and
how
meekly
le
comte
had
borne
it
and
how
scared
his
face
was
and
what
a
joke
the
business
was
altogether
to
see
him
stand
there
wringing
his
hands
and
making
such
a
wailing
about
nothing
but
when
franceline
was
going
to
answer
and
reproach
her
old
with
this
inopportune
mirth
she
laid
her
hand
on
the
young
mouth
and
bade
her
peremptorily
be
silent
you
go
talking
and
scolding
child
there
is
no
knowing
what
mischief
you
may
do
come
and
lie
down
and
keep
perfectly
franceline
obeyed
willingly
enough
she
was
weak
and
tired
and
glad
to
be
alone
awhile
angélique
placed
a
cold
wet
cloth
on
her
chest
and
made
her
some
cold
lemonade
to
drink
it
was
making
a
fuss
about
nothing
to
be
sure
but
it
would
please
le
comte
he
was
never
happier
than
when
people
were
making
a
fuss
over
his
it
was
not
long
before
the
count
returned
accompanied
by
sir
simon
angélique
saw
at
a
glance
that
the
baronet
understood
how
things
were
he
talked
very
big
about
his
confidence
that
angélique
was
right
that
it
was
an
accident
of
no
serious
import
whatever
but
he
exchanged
a
furtive
glance
with
the
old
woman
that
sufficiently
belied
all
this
confident
talk
he
was
for
going
up
to
see
franceline
with
de
la
bourbonais
but
angélique
would
not
allow
this
le
comte
might
go
if
he
liked
provided
he
did
not
make
her
speak
but
nobody
else
must
go
the
room
was
too
small
and
it
would
excite
the
child
to
see
people
about
her
so
raymond
went
up
alone
as
soon
as
his
back
was
turned
angélique
threw
up
her
hands
with
a
gesture
too
significant
for
any
words
sir
simon
closed
the
door
gently
am
not
duped
any
more
than
you
he
said
is
sure
to
be
very
serious
even
if
it
is
not
fatal
tell
me
what
you
really
saw
her
mother
go
through
it
all
it
began
like
this
only
madame
la
comtesse
had
a
cough
the
petite
has
never
had
one
that
is
the
only
thing
that
gives
me
a
bit
of
hope
the
petite
has
never
coughed
o
monsieur
simon
it
is
terrible
it
will
kill
us
all
three
i
know
it
tut
give
up
in
this
way
angélique
said
the
baronet
kindly
and
turning
aside
will
mend
nothing
it
is
the
very
worst
thing
you
could
do
i
agree
with
you
that
it
is
very
serious
not
so
much
the
accident
itself
perhaps
we
know
nothing
about
that
yet
but
on
account
of
the
hereditary
taint
in
the
constitution
however
there
has
been
no
cough
undermining
it
so
far
and
with
care
i
promise
you
she
shall
have
the
best
there
is
every
reason
to
hope
the
child
will
weather
it
at
her
age
one
weathers
everything
he
added
cheerfully
now
despond
a
great
deal
depends
on
your
keeping
a
cheerful
know
it
monsieur
and
i
will
do
my
best
but
i
hear
steps
could
it
be
the
doctor
already
for
sake
run
out
and
meet
him
and
tell
him
as
he
hopes
to
save
us
all
not
to
let
monsieur
le
comte
know
there
is
any
danger
it
is
all
up
with
us
if
he
does
monsieur
le
comte
could
no
more
hide
it
than
a
baby
could
hide
a
pin
in
its
she
opened
the
door
and
almost
pushed
sir
simon
out
in
her
terror
lest
the
doctor
should
walk
in
without
being
warned
sir
simon
met
him
at
the
back
of
the
cottage
a
few
words
were
exchanged
and
they
came
in
together
raymond
met
them
on
the
stairs
the
medical
man
preferred
seeing
his
patient
alone
the
nurse
might
be
present
but
he
could
have
no
one
else
in
a
very
few
minutes
he
came
down
and
a
glance
at
his
face
set
the
heart
almost
completely
at
rest
me
sir
simon
you
would
never
do
for
a
sick
nurse
you
prepared
me
for
a
very
dangerous
case
by
your
message
it
is
a
mere
trifle
hardly
worth
the
hard
ride
had
to
perform
in
twenty
there
is
nothing
amiss
with
the
lungs
you
like
to
sound
them
yourself
count
pray
do
it
will
be
more
satisfactory
to
and
he
handed
his
stethoscope
to
de
la
bourbonais
not
mockingly
but
quite
gravely
and
kindly
that
provincial
doctor
missed
his
vocation
he
ought
to
have
been
a
diplomatist
instead
of
the
proffered
stethoscope
de
la
bourbonais
grasped
his
hand
his
heart
was
too
full
for
speech
the
reaction
of
security
after
the
brief
interval
of
agony
and
suspense
unnerved
him
he
sat
down
without
speaking
and
wiped
the
great
drops
from
his
forehead
the
medical
man
addressed
himself
to
sir
simon
and
angélique
there
was
nothing
whatever
to
be
alarmed
at
but
there
was
occasion
for
care
and
certain
preventive
measures
the
young
lady
must
have
perfect
rest
and
quiet
there
must
be
no
talking
for
some
time
no
excitement
of
any
sort
he
gave
sundry
directions
about
diet
and
wrote
a
prescription
which
was
to
be
sent
to
the
chemist
at
once
de
la
bourbonais
accompanied
him
to
the
door
with
a
lightened
heart
and
bade
him
with
a
warm
pressure
of
the
hand
let
me
hear
the
truth
said
sir
simon
as
soon
as
they
entered
the
park
have
heard
the
truth
though
only
in
a
negative
form
if
you
noticed
we
did
not
commit
ourselves
to
any
opinion
of
the
case
we
only
prescribed
for
it
this
was
the
only
way
in
which
we
could
honestly
follow
your
instructions
observed
the
doctor
who
always
used
the
royal
of
authorship
when
speaking
professionally
showed
great
tact
and
prudence
but
there
is
no
need
for
either
now
tell
me
exactly
what
you
will
be
more
to
the
purpose
to
tell
you
what
we
know
rejoined
the
medical
man
is
a
broken
not
a
large
one
happily
and
if
the
hemorrhage
does
not
increase
and
continue
it
may
prove
of
no
really
serious
consequence
but
then
we
must
remember
the
question
of
inheritance
that
is
what
makes
a
symptom
in
itself
trifling
assume
a
grave
we
refrain
from
saying
fatal
are
convinced
that
this
is
but
the
beginning
of
the
end
am
i
to
understand
that
asked
sir
simon
he
was
used
to
the
pompous
way
and
knew
him
to
be
both
clever
and
conscientious
at
least
towards
his
patients
would
be
precipitating
an
opinion
to
say
so
much
we
are
on
the
whole
inclined
to
take
a
more
sanguine
view
we
consider
the
hitherto
unimpaired
health
of
the
patient
and
her
extreme
youth
fair
grounds
for
hope
but
great
care
must
be
taken
all
excitement
must
be
may
count
on
your
orders
being
strictly
carried
out
said
sir
simon
they
walked
on
a
few
yards
without
further
speech
sir
simon
was
busy
with
anxious
and
affectionate
thoughts
should
fancy
a
warm
climate
would
be
the
best
cure
for
a
case
of
this
kind
he
observed
answering
his
own
reflections
rather
than
speaking
to
his
companion
doubt
no
doubt
assented
blink
the
patient
was
in
a
position
to
authorize
her
medical
attendant
in
ordering
such
a
de
la
bourbonais
is
in
that
position
replied
sir
simon
quietly
i
am
glad
to
know
it
i
may
act
on
the
information
one
of
these
days
the
young
lady
could
not
bear
the
fatigue
of
a
journey
to
the
south
just
now
the
general
health
is
a
good
deal
below
par
the
nervous
system
wants
toning
it
is
sir
simon
made
no
comment
not
at
least
in
words
but
it
set
his
mind
on
painful
conjecture
perhaps
the
electric
chain
passed
from
him
to
his
companion
for
the
latter
said
irrelevantly
but
with
a
significant
expression
as
he
turned
his
glance
full
upon
sir
simon
medical
men
are
trusted
with
many
secrets
secrets
of
the
heart
as
well
as
of
the
body
we
ask
you
frankly
as
a
friend
of
our
patient
is
there
any
moral
cause
at
work
any
disappointed
affection
that
may
have
preyed
on
the
mind
and
fostered
the
inherited
germs
of
disease
can
not
answer
that
question
replied
the
baronet
after
a
hesitation
can
not
or
you
will
not
excuse
my
pertinacity
it
is
professional
and
sir
simon
hesitated
again
before
he
answered
can
not
even
give
a
decided
answer
to
that
i
had
some
time
ago
feared
there
existed
something
of
the
sort
but
of
late
those
apprehensions
had
entirely
disappeared
if
you
had
put
the
question
to
me
yesterday
i
should
have
said
emphatically
there
is
nothing
to
fear
on
that
score
the
child
is
perfectly
happy
and
quite
you
are
not
prepared
to
say
as
much
persisted
blink
has
occurred
to
modify
this
change
of
opinion
except
the
accident
that
you
know
of
and
your
question
now
these
suggest
to
me
that
i
may
have
been
right
in
the
first
it
in
your
power
or
within
the
power
of
circumstances
to
set
the
wrong
right
to
remove
the
cause
of
anxiety
assuming
that
it
actually
exists
it
is
not
nothing
can
remove
she
is
aware
of
this
fear
rather
that
you
hope
not
in
such
cases
hope
is
the
best
physician
let
nothing
be
done
as
far
as
you
can
prevent
it
to
destroy
this
hope
in
the
mind
i
would
even
venture
to
urge
that
you
should
do
anything
in
your
power
to
feed
and
stimulate
is
impossible
quite
impossible
said
sir
simon
emphatically
the
words
fell
on
him
like
a
sting
and
this
very
feeling
increased
to
conviction
what
had
at
the
beginning
of
the
conversation
been
only
a
vague
misgiving
franceline
rallied
quickly
and
with
her
returning
strength
sir
fears
were
allayed
he
had
not
been
able
to
follow
the
advice
as
to
keeping
alive
any
soothing
delusions
that
might
exist
in
her
mind
but
he
succeeded
by
dint
of
continually
dinning
it
into
his
ears
that
there
was
no
danger
in
convincing
her
father
that
there
was
not
and
the
cheerfulness
and
security
that
radiated
from
him
acted
beneficially
on
her
and
proved
of
great
help
to
the
medical
treatment
and
was
blink
right
in
his
surmise
that
a
moral
cause
had
been
at
work
and
contributed
to
the
bursting
of
the
if
franceline
had
been
asked
she
would
have
denied
it
if
any
one
had
said
to
her
that
the
accident
had
been
brought
on
by
mental
suffering
or
insinuated
that
she
was
still
at
heart
pining
for
a
lost
love
she
would
have
answered
with
proud
sincerity
is
false
i
am
not
pining
i
have
ceased
to
think
of
clide
de
winton
i
have
ceased
to
love
but
which
of
us
can
answer
truly
for
our
own
hearts
we
do
not
want
to
idealize
franceline
we
wish
to
describe
her
as
she
was
the
good
with
the
evil
the
struggle
and
the
victory
as
they
alternated
in
her
life
her
heart
fluctuating
but
never
consciously
disloyal
there
must
be
flaws
in
every
picture
taken
from
life
perfection
is
not
to
be
found
in
nature
except
when
seen
through
a
eyes
perhaps
it
was
true
that
franceline
had
ceased
to
love
clide
when
our
will
is
firmly
set
upon
we
are
apt
to
fancy
it
achieved
but
conquest
does
not
of
necessity
bring
joy
or
even
peace
nothing
is
so
terrible
as
a
victory
except
a
defeat
was
a
great
cry
on
surveying
the
bloody
field
of
battle
the
frantic
effort
the
bleeding
trophies
may
inflict
a
on
the
conqueror
as
fatal
in
one
sense
as
defeat
we
see
the
every
day
leading
to
such
issues
brave
souls
fight
and
carry
the
day
and
then
go
to
reap
their
laurels
where
these
voices
there
is
franceline
had
gained
a
victory
but
there
was
no
rejoicing
in
the
triumph
her
heart
plained
still
of
its
wounds
if
she
did
not
hear
it
it
was
because
she
would
not
it
still
bemoaned
its
hard
fate
its
broken
cup
of
happiness
she
rose
up
from
this
illness
however
happier
than
she
had
been
for
months
it
was
difficult
to
believe
that
the
period
which
had
worked
such
changes
to
her
inward
life
counted
only
a
few
months
it
seemed
like
years
like
a
lifetime
since
she
had
first
met
clide
de
winton
she
resumed
her
calmly
busy
little
life
as
before
the
break
had
come
that
suspended
its
active
routine
by
desire
the
teaching
class
was
suppressed
and
the
necessity
of
guarding
against
cold
prevented
her
doing
much
amongst
the
sick
but
this
extra
leisure
in
one
way
enabled
her
to
increase
her
work
in
another
she
devoted
it
to
writing
with
her
father
this
never
tired
her
she
affirmed
it
only
interested
and
amused
her
the
advisability
of
a
trip
to
some
southern
spot
in
france
or
italy
had
been
suggested
by
blink
but
the
proposal
was
rejected
by
his
patient
in
such
a
strenuous
and
excited
manner
that
he
forebore
to
press
it
he
noticed
also
an
expression
of
sudden
pain
on
de
la
countenance
accompanied
by
an
involuntary
sigh
that
led
him
to
believe
there
must
be
pecuniary
impediments
in
the
way
of
the
scheme
notwithstanding
sir
assurance
to
the
contrary
the
was
universally
looked
upon
as
a
poor
man
who
else
would
live
as
he
did
still
sir
simon
must
have
known
what
he
was
saying
however
as
it
happened
the
cold
weather
which
was
now
setting
in
pretty
sharp
was
by
no
means
favorable
to
travelling
so
the
doctor
consented
willingly
enough
to
abide
by
the
circumstances
and
wishes
a
long
journey
in
winter
is
always
a
high
price
for
an
invalid
to
pay
for
the
benefit
of
a
warm
climate
in
the
first
days
of
december
sir
simon
took
flight
from
dullerton
to
nice
lady
rebecca
was
spending
the
winter
at
cannes
and
as
simpson
reported
that
health
had
declined
visibly
within
the
last
month
it
was
natural
that
her
dutiful
should
desire
to
be
within
call
in
case
of
any
painful
eventuality
if
the
climate
of
the
sunny
mediterranean
town
happened
to
be
a
very
congenial
winter
residence
to
him
so
much
the
better
it
is
only
fair
that
a
man
should
have
some
compensation
for
doing
his
duty
the
day
before
he
started
sir
simon
came
down
to
the
lilies
he
said
have
sustained
a
loss
lately
you
must
be
in
want
of
money
now
is
the
time
to
prove
yourself
a
christian
and
let
others
do
unto
you
as
you
would
do
unto
them
you
offered
me
money
once
when
i
did
not
want
it
i
offer
it
to
you
now
that
you
and
he
pressed
a
bundle
of
notes
into
the
hands
but
raymond
crushed
them
back
into
his
cher
simon
i
do
not
thank
you
that
would
be
ungrateful
it
would
look
as
if
i
were
surprised
whereas
i
have
long
since
come
to
take
brotherly
kindness
as
a
matter
of
course
from
you
but
in
truth
i
do
not
want
this
money
i
give
you
my
word
i
you
pledge
your
word
i
must
believe
you
i
suppose
returned
the
baronet
promise
me
one
thing
if
you
should
want
it
you
will
let
me
know
promise
you
i
sir
simon
with
a
sigh
which
raymond
took
for
reluctance
but
which
was
really
one
of
relief
replaced
the
notes
in
his
waistcoat
pocket
had
better
leave
you
a
blank
check
all
the
same
he
said
might
happen
to
want
it
and
not
be
able
to
get
a
letter
to
me
at
once
there
is
no
knowing
where
the
vagabond
spirit
may
lead
me
once
i
am
on
the
move
give
me
a
and
he
seated
himself
at
the
desk
raymond
protested
but
it
was
no
use
sir
simon
would
have
his
own
way
he
wrote
the
blank
check
and
saw
it
locked
up
in
the
private
drawer
de
la
bourbonais
argued
from
this
reckless
committal
of
his
signature
that
the
finances
were
in
a
flourishing
condition
and
was
greatly
rejoiced
alas
if
the
truth
were
known
they
had
never
been
in
a
sorrier
plight
he
had
offered
the
in
all
sincerity
but
if
raymond
had
accepted
it
sir
simon
would
have
been
at
his
end
to
find
the
ready
money
for
his
journey
but
he
kept
this
dark
and
rather
led
his
friend
to
suppose
him
flush
of
money
it
was
the
only
chance
of
getting
him
to
accept
his
generosity
you
keep
me
constantly
informed
how
franceline
gets
on
were
his
parting
words
and
de
la
bourbonais
promised
she
got
on
in
pretty
much
the
same
way
for
some
time
languid
and
pale
but
not
suffering
and
she
had
no
cough
and
no
return
of
the
symptoms
that
had
alarmed
them
all
so
much
angélique
watched
her
as
a
cat
watches
a
mouse
but
even
her
practised
eye
could
detect
no
definite
cause
for
anxiety
one
morning
about
a
fortnight
after
sir
departure
franceline
was
alone
in
the
little
her
father
had
gone
to
do
some
shopping
for
her
in
the
town
as
it
was
too
cold
for
her
to
venture
out
when
sir
ponsonby
anwyll
called
the
moment
she
saw
him
she
flushed
up
partly
with
surprise
partly
with
pleasure
a
casual
observer
would
have
concluded
this
to
be
a
good
sign
for
the
visitor
a
male
friend
would
have
unhesitatingly
pronounced
him
a
lucky
dog
ponsonby
himself
felt
slightly
elated
heard
you
were
ill
he
said
as
i
am
at
home
on
leave
for
a
few
days
i
could
not
resist
coming
to
inquire
for
you
you
are
not
displeased
with
me
for
coming
indeed
it
is
very
kind
of
you
i
am
glad
to
see
you
franceline
replied
with
bright
grateful
eyes
hope
bounded
up
high
in
ponsonby
told
me
you
had
been
very
ill
i
hope
it
is
not
true
you
look
it
he
said
anxiously
have
been
frightening
them
a
little
more
than
it
was
worth
but
i
am
quite
well
now
how
is
lady
anwyll
you
just
as
usual
in
very
good
health
and
a
tremendous
bustle
you
know
i
always
put
the
house
when
i
come
down
not
that
i
mean
to
do
it
it
seems
to
come
of
itself
as
a
natural
consequence
of
my
being
there
he
explained
laughing
de
la
bourbonais
quite
well
well
he
will
be
in
presently
he
is
only
gone
to
make
a
few
purchases
for
anxious
he
must
have
been
while
you
were
ill
papa
yes
he
you
ride
much
now
at
all
i
am
forbidden
to
take
any
violent
exercise
for
the
all
obvious
subjects
being
now
exhausted
there
ensued
a
pause
ponsonby
was
the
first
to
break
it
you
forgiven
me
franceline
he
said
looking
at
her
tenderly
and
with
a
sort
of
sheepish
timidity
i
have
forgiven
and
forgotten
she
replied
and
then
blushing
very
red
and
correcting
herself
quickly
mean
there
was
nothing
to
not
the
sort
of
forgiveness
i
want
said
ponsonby
growing
courageous
in
proportion
as
she
grew
embarrassed
why
can
you
not
like
me
a
little
i
love
you
so
much
no
one
will
ever
love
you
better
or
as
well
she
shook
her
head
but
said
nothing
only
rose
and
went
to
the
window
he
followed
her
are
angry
with
me
again
he
exclaimed
and
was
going
to
break
out
in
entreaties
to
be
forgiven
when
stooping
forward
he
caught
sight
of
her
face
it
was
streaming
with
tears
the
very
mention
of
it
sets
you
crying
why
do
you
hate
me
so
do
not
hate
you
i
never
hated
you
i
wish
with
all
my
heart
i
could
love
you
but
i
can
not
i
can
not
and
you
would
not
have
me
marry
you
if
i
did
not
love
you
it
would
be
false
and
selfish
to
accept
your
love
with
all
it
would
bring
me
and
give
so
little
in
return
she
turned
her
dark
eyes
on
him
still
full
of
tears
but
unabashed
and
innocent
as
if
he
had
been
a
brother
asking
her
to
do
something
unreasonable
little
he
cried
and
seizing
her
hand
he
pressed
it
to
his
lips
you
knew
how
thankful
i
would
be
for
that
little
what
am
i
but
an
awkward
lout
at
best
but
i
will
make
you
happy
franceline
i
swear
to
you
i
will
and
your
father
too
i
will
be
as
good
as
a
son
to
she
made
no
answer
but
the
same
negative
movement
of
her
head
she
looked
out
over
the
winter
fields
with
a
dreamy
expression
as
if
she
only
half
heard
him
while
her
hand
lay
passively
in
his
you
will
be
my
wife
accept
me
franceline
pleaded
the
young
man
and
he
passed
his
arm
around
her
the
action
roused
her
she
snatched
away
her
hand
and
started
from
him
it
was
not
aversion
or
antipathy
it
was
terror
that
dictated
the
movement
something
within
her
cried
out
and
forbade
her
to
listen
she
could
no
more
control
the
sudden
recoil
than
she
could
control
the
tears
that
gushed
out
afresh
this
time
with
loud
sobs
that
shook
her
from
head
to
foot
heavens
what
have
i
done
exclaimed
ponsonby
helpless
and
dismayed
i
go
away
shall
i
leave
you
it
is
nothing
it
is
over
now
said
franceline
her
agitation
quieted
instantaneously
by
the
sight
of
his
she
dashed
the
tears
from
her
cheeks
impatiently
she
was
vexed
with
herself
for
giving
way
so
before
him
down
you
are
trembling
all
over
said
the
young
man
and
he
gently
forced
her
into
a
chair
am
sorry
i
said
anything
i
will
never
mention
the
subject
again
without
your
permission
shall
i
go
away
would
be
very
ungracious
to
say
she
replied
trying
to
smile
through
the
tears
that
hung
like
raindrops
on
her
long
lashes
you
see
how
weak
and
foolish
i
poor
darling
i
will
go
and
leave
you
i
have
been
too
much
for
you
only
tell
me
may
i
come
soon
again
just
to
ask
how
you
are
she
hesitated
to
say
yes
would
be
tacitly
to
accept
him
yet
it
was
odious
to
turn
him
off
like
this
without
a
word
of
kindly
explanation
to
soften
the
pang
ponsonby
could
not
read
these
thoughts
so
he
construed
her
hesitation
according
to
the
immemorial
logic
of
lovers
never
mind
answering
now
he
said
bother
you
any
more
you
will
present
my
respects
to
the
count
and
say
how
sorry
i
was
not
to
see
he
held
out
his
hand
for
will
meet
him
on
the
road
i
dare
say
said
franceline
extending
hers
will
not
tell
him
how
i
have
misbehaved
to
you
the
shy
smile
that
accompanied
the
request
emboldened
ponsonby
to
raise
the
soft
white
hand
to
his
lips
then
turning
away
he
overturned
a
little
wicker
happily
with
no
injury
to
the
sturdy
green
plant
but
with
considerable
damage
to
the
dignity
of
his
exit
perhaps
you
will
say
that
mlle
de
la
bourbonais
behaved
like
a
flirt
in
parting
with
a
discarded
lover
in
this
fashion
it
is
easy
for
you
to
say
so
it
is
not
so
easy
for
a
woman
with
a
heart
to
inflict
unmitigated
pain
on
a
man
who
loves
her
and
whose
love
she
at
least
requites
with
gratitude
esteem
and
sisterly
regard
sir
ponsonby
met
the
count
on
the
road
he
made
sure
of
the
encounter
by
walking
his
horse
up
and
down
the
green
lane
which
commanded
the
road
from
dullerton
to
the
lilies
what
passed
between
them
remained
the
secret
of
themselves
and
the
winter
thrush
that
perched
on
the
brown
hedge
close
by
and
sang
out
lustily
to
the
trees
and
fields
while
they
conversed
de
la
bourbonais
made
no
comment
on
his
cheeks
when
he
came
home
but
taking
her
face
between
his
hands
as
he
was
fond
of
doing
he
gave
one
wistful
look
kissed
it
and
let
it
go
long
you
have
been
away
petit
père
shall
we
go
to
our
writing
now
she
inquired
cheerfully
thou
not
tired
my
child
what
have
i
done
to
tire
me
she
sat
down
at
his
desk
and
nothing
was
said
of
sir
ponsonby
visit
the
excitement
of
that
interview
told
nevertheless
on
franceline
it
left
her
nervous
and
weaker
than
she
had
been
since
her
recovery
these
symptoms
escaped
her
notice
and
they
would
have
escaped
owing
to
strenuous
efforts
to
conceal
them
if
a
slight
cough
had
not
come
to
put
her
on
the
more
than
ever
it
was
very
slight
indeed
only
attacking
her
in
the
morning
when
she
awoke
and
quite
ceasing
by
the
time
she
was
dressed
and
room
was
at
one
end
of
the
cottage
angélique
slept
next
to
her
and
at
the
other
end
with
the
stairs
intervening
was
the
room
he
was
thus
out
of
of
the
sound
which
however
rare
and
seemingly
unimportant
would
have
filled
him
with
alarm
franceline
treated
it
as
a
trifle
not
worth
mentioning
but
when
her
old
insisted
on
taking
her
discreetly
to
blink
and
having
his
opinion
about
it
she
gave
in
to
humor
her
the
doctor
once
more
applied
his
stethoscope
and
then
smiling
that
grim
satisfied
smile
of
his
that
was
so
reassuring
to
patients
till
they
had
seen
it
practised
on
others
and
found
out
it
was
a
fallacy
remarked
are
glad
to
be
able
to
assure
you
again
that
there
is
nothing
to
be
frightened
at
no
mischief
that
can
not
be
forestalled
by
care
and
docility
to
our
instructions
he
added
emphatically
must
order
you
some
tonics
and
you
must
take
them
regularly
how
is
the
appetite
turning
to
angélique
who
stood
by
devouring
the
words
and
watching
every
line
of
his
features
with
a
shrewd
almost
vicious
expression
of
mistrust
on
her
brown
face
the
appetite
she
will
not
be
eating
many
she
will
be
wanting
dainty
plates
which
i
can
not
make
explained
the
frenchwoman
sticking
pertinaciously
to
the
future
tense
as
usual
when
she
spoke
english
are
liable
to
those
caprices
of
the
palate
remarked
blink
blandly
miss
franceline
will
be
brave
and
overcome
them
dainty
dishes
are
not
always
the
most
nourishing
and
nourishment
is
necessary
for
her
it
is
is
what
i
will
be
telling
mamselle
assented
angélique
she
will
not
be
believing
me
i
will
be
telling
her
every
day
the
strength
is
in
the
bouillon
but
she
will
be
making
a
grimace
and
saying
the
last
word
was
uttered
with
a
grimace
so
expressive
that
franceline
burst
out
laughing
and
the
pompous
little
doctor
joined
in
it
in
spite
of
his
dignity
she
promised
to
do
her
best
to
obey
him
and
overcome
her
dislike
to
the
bouillon
native
panacea
and
to
other
substantial
food
but
she
found
it
very
hard
to
keep
the
promise
it
required
something
savory
to
tempt
her
weak
appetite
angélique
saw
she
was
doing
her
best
and
never
pressed
the
poor
child
needlessly
but
she
would
groan
over
the
plate
as
she
removed
it
sometimes
untouched
used
to
think
myself
a
until
now
she
said
once
to
franceline
with
an
impatient
sigh
i
am
at
the
end
of
my
talent
i
can
do
nothing
to
please
and
then
she
would
long
for
sir
simon
to
come
home
it
happened
unluckily
that
the
professed
artist
who
presided
over
the
kitchen
at
the
court
was
taking
a
holiday
during
his
absence
angélique
would
have
scorned
to
invoke
the
skill
of
the
subaltern
who
replaced
him
but
she
had
a
profound
admiration
for
the
himself
and
though
an
englishman
she
bowed
unreservedly
to
his
superior
talents
the
belief
was
current
that
sir
simon
would
spend
the
christmas
at
dullerton
he
always
did
when
not
at
too
great
a
distance
at
that
time
it
was
the
right
thing
for
an
english
gentleman
to
do
and
his
bitterest
foe
would
not
accuse
the
baronet
of
failing
to
act
up
to
that
standard
this
year
however
it
was
not
possible
the
weather
was
glorious
at
nice
and
it
was
anything
but
that
at
dullerton
and
the
long
journey
in
the
cold
was
not
attractive
he
wrote
home
desiring
the
usual
festivities
to
be
arranged
according
to
the
old
custom
of
the
place
coals
and
clothing
were
to
be
distributed
the
fatted
calf
was
to
be
killed
for
the
tenantry
and
everybody
was
enjoined
to
eat
drink
and
be
merry
in
spite
of
the
absence
they
conscientiously
followed
these
hospitable
injunctions
but
it
was
a
grievous
disappointment
that
sir
simon
was
not
in
their
midst
to
stimulate
the
conviviality
by
his
kindly
and
genial
presence
pretty
presents
came
to
the
lilies
but
they
did
not
bring
strength
to
franceline
she
grew
more
transparent
more
as
the
days
went
on
angélique
held
private
conferences
with
miss
merrywig
and
that
lady
suggested
that
any
of
the
large
houses
in
the
neighborhood
would
be
only
too
delighted
to
be
of
any
use
in
sending
jellies
flavored
with
good
strong
wine
there
was
nothing
so
nourishing
for
an
invalid
miss
merrywig
would
speak
to
one
where
there
was
a
capital
cook
but
angélique
would
not
hear
of
it
no
no
much
as
she
longed
for
the
jelly
she
dared
not
get
it
in
this
way
le
comte
would
never
forgive
her
will
be
so
proud
le
comte
he
will
be
a
scotchman
he
will
not
be
confessing
even
to
me
that
he
wants
nothing
but
monsieur
simon
will
be
coming
he
will
be
coming
soon
and
then
he
will
be
making
little
plates
for
mamselle
every
meantime
she
and
franceline
did
their
best
to
hide
from
raymond
this
particular
reason
for
desiring
their
return
but
he
noticed
that
she
ate
next
to
nothing
and
that
she
often
signed
to
angélique
to
remove
her
plate
on
which
the
food
remained
untasted
once
he
could
not
forbear
exclaiming
if
we
were
in
paris
i
could
get
some
to
tempt
thee
in
the
middle
of
january
one
morning
a
letter
came
from
sir
simon
bearing
the
london
postmark
he
had
been
obliged
to
come
to
england
on
pressing
business
of
a
harassing
nature
sir
simon
coming
home
petit
père
inquired
franceline
eagerly
as
her
father
opened
the
letter
but
only
for
a
day
he
will
be
here
after
and
fly
away
to
nice
the
next
tiresome
of
him
but
it
is
better
to
see
him
for
a
day
than
not
at
all
does
he
say
what
hour
he
arrives
we
will
go
and
meet
will
be
too
late
for
thee
to
be
out
my
child
he
comes
by
the
late
afternoon
train
just
in
time
to
dress
for
dinner
and
receive
us
all
he
has
invited
several
friends
in
the
neighborhood
to
a
funny
idea
and
he
is
only
coming
for
the
day
for
the
eyebrows
closed
like
a
horseshoe
over
his
meditative
eyes
as
he
folded
the
letter
and
laid
it
aside
there
was
more
in
it
than
he
communicated
to
franceline
it
was
the
old
story
money
tight
bills
falling
due
and
no
means
of
meeting
them
lady
rebecca
had
taken
a
fresh
start
thanks
to
an
italian
quack
who
had
been
up
from
naples
and
worked
wonders
with
some
diabolical
elixir
diabolical
beyond
a
doubt
for
nothing
but
the
could
explain
the
sudden
and
extraordinary
rally
she
was
all
but
dead
when
the
quack
arrived
so
simpson
heard
from
one
of
her
attendants
simpson
himself
was
terribly
put
out
by
the
news
it
overturned
all
his
immediate
plans
he
saw
no
possibility
of
any
longer
avoiding
extremities
extremities
meant
that
the
principal
creditor
a
jew
who
had
lent
a
sum
of
thirty
thousand
pounds
on
sir
in
dullerton
at
the
rate
of
twenty
per
cent
was
now
determined
to
wait
no
longer
for
his
arrears
of
twenty
per
cent
but
turn
the
baronet
out
of
possession
and
sell
his
in
the
estate
this
sword
of
damocles
had
been
hanging
over
his
head
for
the
last
ten
years
it
was
to
meet
this
usurious
interest
periodically
that
sir
simon
was
driven
to
such
close
quarters
he
had
up
to
this
time
contrived
to
answer
the
demand
heaven
and
simpson
alone
knew
at
what
sacrifices
but
now
he
had
come
to
a
point
beyond
which
even
he
declared
he
could
not
possibly
carry
his
client
he
had
tried
to
negotiate
bills
on
lady
fifty
thousand
pounds
but
the
jews
were
too
sharp
for
that
lady
rebecca
was
sole
master
of
her
fifty
thousand
pounds
and
might
leave
it
to
whom
she
liked
she
had
made
her
will
bequeathing
it
to
her
and
was
morally
as
certain
of
ultimately
possessing
the
money
as
if
it
were
entailed
but
moral
security
is
no
security
at
all
to
a
the
money
was
entailed
lady
rebecca
might
take
it
into
her
head
to
alter
her
will
she
might
leave
it
to
a
quack
doctor
or
to
some
clever
sycophant
of
an
attendant
there
is
no
saying
what
an
old
lady
of
may
not
do
with
fifty
thousand
pounds
sir
simon
pshawed
and
contemptuously
when
simpson
enumerated
these
arguments
against
the
negotiation
of
the
bills
but
it
was
no
use
israel
was
inexorable
and
now
one
particular
member
of
the
tribe
called
moses
to
witness
that
if
he
were
not
paid
his
per
on
the
first
of
february
he
would
seize
upon
the
of
dullerton
court
and
make
its
present
owner
a
bankrupt
he
could
sell
nothing
either
in
the
house
or
on
the
estate
the
plate
and
pictures
and
furniture
were
entailed
if
this
were
not
the
case
things
need
not
have
come
to
this
with
sir
simon
two
of
those
raphaels
in
the
great
gallery
would
have
paid
the
jew
principal
and
interest
together
but
not
a
spoon
or
a
in
the
court
could
be
touched
everything
belonged
to
the
heir
no
mention
has
hitherto
been
made
of
that
important
person
because
he
in
no
way
concerns
this
story
except
by
the
fact
of
his
existence
he
was
a
distant
kinsman
of
the
present
baronet
who
had
never
seen
him
he
was
in
diplomacy
and
so
lived
always
abroad
people
are
said
to
dislike
their
heirs
if
sir
simon
disliked
any
human
being
it
was
his
he
did
not
dislike
lady
rebecca
he
was
only
out
of
patience
with
her
she
certainly
was
an
aggravating
old
woman
living
on
to
no
purpose
that
he
could
see
except
to
frustrate
and
harass
him
yet
he
had
kindly
thoughts
of
her
he
had
only
cold
aversion
towards
the
man
who
was
waiting
for
his
own
death
to
come
and
rule
in
his
stead
he
had
never
spoken
of
him
to
de
la
bourbonais
except
to
inform
him
that
he
existed
and
that
he
stood
in
his
way
on
many
occasions
in
the
letter
of
this
morning
he
spoke
of
him
once
more
the
letter
was
a
long
one
and
calmer
than
any
previous
effusion
of
the
kind
that
raymond
remembered
there
was
very
little
vituperation
of
the
duns
or
even
of
the
chief
scoundrel
who
was
about
to
tear
away
the
veil
that
had
hitherto
concealed
the
sores
and
flaws
in
the
popular
life
this
was
what
he
felt
most
deeply
in
it
all
the
disgrace
of
being
shown
up
as
a
sham
a
man
who
had
lived
like
a
prince
while
he
had
been
in
reality
a
beggar
in
debt
up
to
his
ears
and
who
was
now
about
to
be
made
a
bankrupt
raymond
had
never
before
understood
the
real
nature
of
his
embarrassment
he
was
shocked
and
distressed
more
than
he
could
express
it
was
not
the
moment
to
judge
him
to
remember
the
reckless
extravagance
the
criminal
want
of
prudence
of
conscience
that
had
brought
him
to
this
pass
he
only
thought
of
the
friend
of
his
youth
the
kind
faithful
delightful
companion
who
had
never
failed
in
friendship
whatever
his
other
sins
may
have
been
and
now
he
was
ruined
disgraced
before
the
world
going
to
be
driven
forth
from
his
ancestral
home
branded
as
a
sham
raymond
could
have
wept
for
pity
then
it
occurred
to
him
with
a
strange
pang
that
he
was
to
dine
with
sir
simon
the
next
day
the
head
cook
had
been
telegraphed
for
to
prepare
the
dinner
there
was
to
be
a
jovial
gathering
of
friends
to
him
what
a
mystery
it
was
this
craving
for
being
cheered
up
as
if
the
process
were
a
substantial
remedy
that
in
some
way
helped
to
pay
debts
or
postpone
payment
the
count
was
too
sad
at
heart
to
smile
he
rose
from
the
with
a
sigh
and
was
leaving
the
room
when
franceline
linked
her
hands
on
his
arm
and
said
looking
up
with
an
anxious
face
is
a
long
letter
petit
père
is
there
any
bad
news
is
hardly
any
news
at
all
he
replied
evasively
in
truth
there
was
not
why
do
you
look
so
sad
dost
thou
look
so
pale
was
the
reply
and
he
smiled
tenderly
and
sighed
again
as
he
kissed
her
forehead
to
be
continued
æschylus
a
carved
into
a
art
rough
from
hand
by
brooding
nature
wrought
out
in
spasms
to
shapes
of
titan
stature
emblems
of
fate
and
change
revenge
and
grief
and
death
and
life
in
giant
hieroglyph
confronting
still
with
frieze
all
stress
of
years
and
winds
and
wasting
seas
the
stranger
nears
it
in
his
western
skiff
and
hides
his
eyes
few
few
shall
dare
great
bard
thy
watery
portals
entering
fewer
yet
shall
pierce
thy
meaning
deep
and
hard
but
these
shall
owe
to
thee
an
endless
debt
the
eleusinian
caverns
they
shall

a
precursor
of
marco

the
merchants
and
missionaries
who
were
the
first
travellers
and
ambassadors
of
christian
times
little
thought
absorbed
as
they
were
in
the
object
of
their
quest
how
large
a
share
of
interest
in
the
eyes
of
posterity
would
centre
in
the
quaint
observations
descriptions
and
drawings
which
they
were
able
incidentally
to
gather
or
make
marco
name
and
even
those
of
his
father
and
uncle
niccolo
and
matteo
polo
are
well
known
and
are
associated
with
all
that
barbaric
magnificence
the
memory
of
which
had
a
great
share
in
keeping
alive
the
perseverance
of
subsequent
explorers
it
was
fitting
that
traders
in
jewels
should
reach
the
more
civilized
and
splendid
tartars
and
no
doubt
their
store
of
rich
presents
and
their
garments
of
ample
dimensions
as
well
as
fine
texture
would
prove
a
passport
through
tribes
so
passionately
acquisitive
as
the
tartars
seem
to
have
been
nomads
are
not
always
or
unambitious
the
franciscan
whose
travels
come
just
between
the
expedition
of
the
elder
polo
and
the
more
famous
marco
friar
william
rubruquis
did
not
have
the
to
see
the
wonders
his
successor
described
but
he
mentions
repeatedly
that
his
entertainers
made
reiterated
and
minute
inquiries
as
to
the
abundance
of
flocks
and
herds
in
the
country
he
came
from
and
that
they
wondered
rather
contemptuously
at
the
presents
of
sweet
wine
dried
fruits
and
delicate
cakes
which
were
all
he
had
to
offer
their
great
princes
rubruquis
was
traveller
missionary
and
ambassador
but
in
the
two
pursuits
denoted
by
the
titles
his
success
was
but
small
as
a
traveller
however
he
was
hardy
persevering
and
observant
though
not
bred
a
horseman
he
often
rode
thirty
leagues
a
day
and
half
the
time
at
full
gallop
he
says
his
companions
monks
like
himself
could
not
stand
the
fatigue
and
both
at
different
intervals
parted
company
from
him
but
rubruquis
was
young
and
strong
though
as
he
himself
says
corpulent
and
heavy
and
above
all
he
was
enterprising
he
was
not
more
than
when
he
started
on
his
quest
of
the
christian
monarch
whom
all
the
rulers
of
europe
firmly
believed
in
and
whose
name
has
come
down
to
us
as
prester
john
born
in
he
devoted
himself
early
to
the
church
and
during
the
fourth
crusade
went
on
a
pilgrimage
to
the
holy
land
his
real
name
was
ruysbroek
but
according
to
the
unpatriotic
fashion
of
the
times
he
latinized
it
into
rubruquis
louis
king
of
france
eager
for
the
christian
alliance
which
the
supposed
prester
john
would
be
able
to
enter
into
with
him
had
once
already
sent
an
embassy
of
monks
to
seek
him
but
they
had
failed
to
perform
a
sixth
part
of
the
journey
set
down
for
them
and
had
heard
no
tidings
of
a
monarch
answering
to
the
description
the
king
nothing
daunted
determined
to
send
another
embassy
on
a
voyage
of
discovery
vague
news
of
a
christian
tartar
chief
by
name
sartach
had
come
to
him
probably
the
toleration
extended
by
the
tartars
to
christians
a
contrast
to
the
behavior
of
most
saracenic
chiefs
led
to
this
obstinate
belief
in
a
remote
christian
empire
of
the
east
william
de
rubruquis
bartholomew
of
cremona
and
a
companion
named
andrew
all
franciscan
friars
were
chosen
for
this
new
expedition
on
the
of
may
says
his
narrative
though
it
has
since
been
calculated
that
as
louis
was
a
captive
at
the
time
the
date
is
more
likely
to
be
correct
the
travellers
having
crossed
the
black
sea
from
constantinople
landed
at
soldaia
near
cherson
the
king
somewhat
unwisely
as
it
proved
had
told
his
envoy
to
represent
himself
as
a
private
individual
travelling
on
his
own
account
but
the
tartars
were
acute
and
jealous
of
foreigners
they
knew
that
travelling
entailed
too
much
fatigue
and
danger
to
be
undertaken
simply
for
pleasure
and
they
had
small
regard
for
any
stranger
unless
the
representative
of
a
prince
they
guessed
his
mission
and
taxed
him
with
it
till
he
was
obliged
to
acknowledge
that
he
was
the
bearer
of
letters
from
the
christian
king
of
france
to
the
mighty
khan
sartach
but
though
the
people
do
not
seem
to
have
taken
him
for
a
private
person
they
were
puzzled
by
the
poverty
of
his
dress
and
the
scantiness
of
the
presents
he
offered
them
even
small
dignitaries
expected
to
be
royally
propitiated
he
explained
his
vow
of
poverty
to
them
but
this
did
not
impress
the
tartars
as
favorably
as
he
wished
still
he
met
with
nothing
but
civility
and
hospitality
rubruquis
says
that
soldaia
was
a
great
mart
for
furs
which
the
russians
exchanged
with
the
merchants
of
constantinople
for
silks
cotton
spices
etc
the
third
day
after
his
departure
he
met
a
wandering
tribe
whom
being
entered
he
says
i
was
come
into
a
new
he
goes
on
to
describe
their
houses
on
wheels
no
despicable
or
narrow
habitations
even
according
to
modern
ideas
houses
in
which
they
sleep
they
raise
upon
a
round
foundation
of
wickers
artificially
wrought
and
compacted
together
the
roof
consisting
of
wickers
also
meeting
above
in
one
little
roundel
out
of
which
there
rises
upwards
a
neck
like
a
chimney
which
they
cover
with
white
felt
and
often
they
lay
mortar
or
white
earth
upon
the
felt
with
the
powder
of
bones
that
it
may
shine
and
look
white
sometimes
also
they
cover
their
houses
with
black
felt
this
cupola
they
adorn
with
a
variety
of
pictures
before
the
door
they
hang
a
felt
curiously
painted
over
for
they
spend
all
their
colored
felt
in
painting
vines
trees
birds
and
beasts
thereupon
these
houses
they
make
so
large
that
they
contain
thirty
feet
in
breadth
for
measuring
once
the
breadth
between
the
i
found
it
to
be
twenty
feet
over
and
when
the
house
was
upon
the
cart
it
stretched
over
the
wheels
on
each
side
five
feet
at
least
i
told
oxen
in
one
draught
drawing
an
house
upon
a
cart
and
eleven
more
on
the
other
side
two
rows
one
in
front
of
the
other
we
suppose
a
fellow
stood
in
the
door
of
the
house
driving
the
sometimes
a
woman
drove
or
walked
at
the
head
of
the
leaders
to
guide
them
woman
will
guide
twenty
or
thirty
carts
at
once
for
their
country
is
very
flat
and
they
fasten
the
carts
with
camels
or
oxen
one
behind
another
a
girl
sits
in
the
foremost
cart
driving
the
oxen
and
all
the
rest
of
themselves
follow
at
a
like
pace
when
they
come
to
a
place
which
is
a
bad
passage
they
loose
them
and
guide
them
one
by
the
baggage
was
so
arranged
as
to
be
taken
through
the
smaller
rivers
of
asia
without
being
injured
or
wetted
it
consisted
of
square
chests
of
with
a
hollow
lid
or
cover
of
the
same
with
black
felt
rubbed
over
with
tallow
or
milk
to
keep
the
rain
from
soaking
through
which
they
also
adorn
with
painting
or
white
these
were
placed
on
carts
with
very
high
wheels
and
drawn
by
camels
instead
of
oxen
the
encampment
was
like
a
large
village
well
defended
by
palisades
formed
of
the
carts
off
which
the
houses
had
been
taken
and
which
were
drawn
up
in
two
compact
lines
one
in
front
and
one
in
the
rear
of
the
dwellings
it
were
between
two
walls
says
our
traveller
a
rich
tartar
commonly
had
one
hundred
or
even
two
hundred
such
each
house
had
several
small
houses
belonging
to
it
placed
behind
it
serving
as
closets
and
sleeping
chambers
and
often
as
many
as
two
hundred
chests
and
their
necessary
carts
this
made
immense
numbers
of
camels
and
oxen
for
draught
necessary
and
besides
there
were
the
animals
for
food
and
milk
and
the
horses
for
the
men
they
had
milk
and
milk
two
species
of
food
which
they
used
very
differently
and
even
made
of
social
and
religious
importance
only
the
men
were
allowed
to
milk
the
mares
while
the
women
attended
to
the
cows
and
any
interchange
of
these
offices
would
have
been
deemed
in
a
man
unpardonable
effeminacy
and
in
a
woman
indelicacy
at
the
door
of
the
houses
stood
two
tutelary
deities
monsters
of
both
sexes
the
milk
served
for
the
food
of
women
and
children
while
the
milk
was
made
into
a
fermented
liquor
called
cosmos
this
was
supposed
to
make
a
heathen
of
the
man
who
drank
it
for
the
nestorian
christians
found
among
them
keep
their
own
laws
very
strictly
will
not
drink
thereof
they
account
themselves
no
christians
after
they
have
once
drunk
of
it
and
their
priests
reconcile
them
to
the
church
as
if
they
had
renounced
the
christian
this
cosmos
was
made
thus
the
milk
was
poured
into
a
large
skin
bag
and
the
bag
beaten
with
a
wooden
club
until
the
milk
began
to
ferment
and
turn
sour
the
bag
was
then
shaken
and
cudgelled
again
until
most
of
it
turned
to
butter
after
which
the
liquid
was
supposed
to
be
fit
for
drinking
rubruquis
evidently
liked
it
says
it
was
exhilarating
to
the
spirits
and
even
intoxicating
to
weak
heads
pungent
to
the
taste
raspberry
wine
but
left
a
flavor
on
the
palate
a
rarer
quality
of
the
same
and
reserved
for
the
chiefs
only
was
produced
by
prolonging
the
beating
of
the
bag
until
the
coagulated
portions
subsided
to
the
bottom
these
drinks
were
received
as
tribute
or
taxes
baatu
a
chief
with
sixteen
wives
received
the
produce
of
three
thousand
mares
daily
besides
a
quantity
of
common
cosmos
a
bowl
of
which
almost
always
stood
on
the
threshold
of
every
rich
house
the
tartars
often
drank
of
it
to
excess
and
their
banquets
were
relieved
by
music
at
these
feasts
in
which
both
sexes
participated
the
guests
clapped
their
hands
and
danced
to
the
music
the
men
before
their
host
the
women
before
his
principal
wife
the
host
always
drank
first
the
moment
he
put
his
lips
to
the
bowl
of
cosmos
his
cried
aloud
and
the
musicians
struck
up
this
almost
sounds
like
a
mediæval
banquet
when
all
the
guests
rose
and
shouted
king
drinks
and
then
drained
their
goblets
in
imitation
of
the
monarch
of
the
night
the
tartars
respectfully
waited
till
the
lord
of
the
feast
had
finished
his
draught
when
the
again
cried
and
the
music
ceased
after
a
pause
the
guests
male
and
female
drank
round
in
turns
each
one
to
the
sound
of
music
with
a
pause
and
silence
before
the
next
person
took
up
the
cup
this
fashion
of
drinking
continued
unchanged
for
many
centuries
and
later
travellers
amid
the
increased
pomp
of
the
court
of
the
tartar
emperors
of
china
found
it
still
in
force
music
cries
pauses
and
all
we
have
also
seen
not
many
years
ago
on
the
occasion
of
the
marriage
of
the
late
young
emperor
of
china
illustrations
of
the
wedding
procession
representing
immensely
wide
carts
drawn
by
eleven
oxen
abreast
laden
with
costly
state
furniture
and
if
we
take
away
the
pomp
and
gilding
the
picture
is
not
unlike
that
of
the
tartar
seen
by
our
traveller
rubruquis
hints
that
the
tartars
were
not
a
temperate
people
they
drank
much
and
not
cleanly
and
the
way
of
a
person
to
drink
was
to
seize
his
ears
and
pull
them
forcibly
the
sweet
wine
of
which
the
monk
had
a
small
supply
pleased
them
very
well
but
they
thought
him
not
lavish
enough
in
his
hospitality
for
once
on
his
offering
the
master
of
the
house
one
flagon
of
this
wine
the
man
gravely
drained
it
and
asked
for
another
saying
that
man
does
not
go
into
a
house
with
one
in
return
however
they
did
not
give
him
much
to
eat
but
perhaps
he
suffered
hunger
rather
from
his
prejudice
to
the
meat
they
ate
than
from
their
niggardliness
in
giving
he
at
last
learned
to
eat
but
was
disgusted
at
his
eating
the
bodies
of
animals
that
had
died
of
disease
the
tartars
were
honest
enough
and
never
even
took
things
by
force
but
they
begged
for
everything
that
took
their
fancy
as
unblushingly
as
some
of
paul
du
negroes
in
africa
it
surprised
them
to
be
refused
anything
knives
gloves
purses
and
when
gratified
never
thought
it
necessary
to
thank
their
guests
after
a
while
rubruquis
met
the
carts
of
zagatai
one
of
the
chieftains
to
whom
he
brought
a
letter
from
the
emperor
of
constantinople
here
the
tartars
asked
we
had
in
our
carts
whether
it
were
gold
or
silver
or
rich
and
both
zagatai
and
his
interpreter
were
haughtily
discontented
at
finding
that
at
least
some
garment
of
value
was
not
forthcoming
this
is
not
wonderful
considering
the
wealth
of
their
own
great
khans
of
whom
a
later
one
kooblai
so
celebrated
in
marco
travels
gave
his
twelve
lords
twelve
times
in
the
year
robes
of
silk
embroidered
with
gold
and
precious
stones
zagatai
however
received
the
ambassador
graciously
sat
on
his
bed
says
rubruquis
a
musical
instrument
in
his
hand
and
his
wife
sat
by
him
who
in
my
opinion
had
cut
and
pared
her
nose
between
the
eyes
that
she
might
seem
to
be
more
for
she
had
left
herself
no
nose
at
all
in
that
place
having
anointed
the
very
scar
with
black
ointment
as
she
also
did
her
eyebrows
which
sight
seemed
to
me
most
i
besought
him
that
he
would
accept
this
small
gift
at
our
hands
excusing
myself
that
i
was
a
monk
and
that
it
was
against
our
profession
to
possess
gold
silver
or
precious
garments
and
therefore
that
i
had
not
any
such
thing
to
give
him
unless
he
would
receive
some
part
of
our
victuals
instead
of
a
the
tartars
were
always
eager
to
receive
a
blessing
over
and
above
any
present
he
was
constantly
asked
to
make
over
them
the
sign
of
the
cross
but
it
is
to
be
feared
that
they
looked
upon
it
as
a
charm
and
of
charms
they
have
too
many
from
zagatai
rubruquis
went
to
sartach
who
said
he
had
no
power
of
treating
with
him
and
sent
him
on
to
his
baatu
the
patriarch
with
sixteen
wives
and
several
hundred
houses
losing
his
and
baggage
on
the
way
for
the
independent
tribes
did
not
scruple
to
exact
tribute
from
a
traveller
even
if
he
was
a
friend
of
their
neighbors
he
never
lost
his
courage
and
his
determination
to
sow
the
seeds
of
truth
in
tartary
he
did
not
know
the
language
at
first
and
only
learnt
it
very
imperfectly
at
the
last
here
and
there
a
captive
christian
mostly
hungarians
or
a
tartar
who
had
learnt
the
rudiments
of
christianity
during
an
invasion
of
his
tribe
into
europe
acted
as
interpreter
all
were
uniformly
kind
to
him
one
of
them
who
understood
latin
and
psalmody
was
in
great
request
at
all
the
funerals
of
his
neighborhood
but
the
of
the
natives
was
but
a
shred
of
nestorianism
worked
into
a
web
of
paganism
so
that
the
farther
he
advanced
the
farther
the
great
powerful
united
christian
community
headed
by
prester
john
seemed
to
recede
the
people
took
kindly
to
christian
usages
and
had
some
respect
for
the
forms
and
ceremonies
which
the
monk
and
his
companions
endeavored
to
keep
up
but
when
it
came
to
doctrine
and
morality
they
grew
impatient
and
unresponsive
one
of
interpreters
often
refused
to
do
his
office
thus
says
the
traveller
caused
me
great
chagrin
when
i
wished
to
address
to
them
a
few
words
of
edification
for
he
would
say
to
me
shall
not
make
me
preach
i
understand
nothing
of
all
you
tell
and
then
he
spoke
the
truth
for
afterwards
as
i
began
to
understand
a
little
of
their
tongue
i
perceived
that
when
i
told
him
one
thing
he
repeated
another
just
according
to
his
fancy
therefore
seeing
it
was
no
use
to
talk
or
preach
i
held
my
hard
riding
was
not
the
only
thing
that
distressed
the
ambassador
of
the
king
of
france
his
companions
gave
him
meat
that
was
less
than
and
sometimes
positively
raw
then
the
cold
began
to
be
severe
and
still
there
were
at
least
four
travel
before
him
the
tartars
were
kind
to
him
in
their
rough
way
and
gave
him
some
of
their
thick
sheepskins
and
hide
shoes
he
had
insisted
on
journeying
most
of
the
time
in
his
franciscan
sandals
and
full
of
ardor
for
his
rule
had
constantly
refused
gifts
of
costly
garments
this
the
tartars
never
quite
understood
but
they
respected
the
principle
which
caused
him
to
make
so
many
sacrifices
for
the
sake
and
furtherance
of
his
religion
wherever
he
passed
he
and
his
companions
endeared
themselves
to
the
inhabitants
by
many
little
services
doubtless
also
by
cures
wrought
by
simple
remedies
and
generally
by
their
gentle
unselfish
conduct
towards
all
men
rubruquis
observed
everything
minutely
as
he
passed
the
manners
and
customs
of
the
people
interested
him
and
perhaps
he
did
not
consider
them
quite
such
barbarians
as
we
of
later
days
are
apt
to
do
when
we
read
the
accounts
of
domestic
life
among
the
majority
of
people
in
mediæval
times
and
see
that
refinement
of
manner
was
less
thought
of
than
costliness
of
apparel
and
wealth
of
plate
and
cattle
the
difference
between
such
manners
and
those
of
the
tartars
is
not
appreciable
few
in
those
days
were
learned
and
learning
it
is
that
has
always
made
the
real
difference
between
a
gentleman
and
a
boor
the
marauding
chieftains
of
feudal
times
were
only
romantic
and
titled
highwaymen
after
all
so
were
the
wandering
tartars
the
difference
that
has
since
sprung
up
between
the
descendants
of
the
marauding
barons
and
those
of
the
tartar
chiefs
is
mainly
one
of
race
the
former
are
of
an
enterprising
improving
race
the
latter
of
a
stagnant
one
and
while
the
european
nations
that
then
trembled
before
the
invading
hordes
of
have
now
developed
into
intellectual
superiority
over
every
other
race
in
the
world
the
tartar
is
still
socially
and
intellectually
on
the
same
old
level
and
his
political
advantages
have
vanished
with
his
rude
warlike
superiority
before
the
diplomacy
and
the
military
organization
of
his
former
victims
rubruquis
noticed
that
among
the
superstitions
common
in
tartary
was
a
belief
that
it
was
unlucky
for
a
visitor
to
touch
the
threshold
of
a
door
modern
travellers
assert
the
same
of
the
chinese
whenever
our
envoy
paid
a
visit
he
deferred
to
this
belief
by
carefully
stepping
across
the
threshold
of
the
house
or
tent
without
letting
any
part
of
his
person
or
dress
come
in
contact
with
it
their
dress
on
festive
occasions
was
rich
for
they
traded
with
china
persia
and
other
southern
and
eastern
countries
for
of
silk
cloths
of
gold
and
cotton
cloths
which
they
wear
in
time
of
summer
but
out
of
russia
bulgaria
hungaria
and
out
of
chersis
all
which
are
northern
regions
and
full
of
woods
the
inhabitants
bring
them
rich
and
costly
skins
and
furs
of
divers
sorts
which
i
never
saw
in
our
countries
wherewithal
they
are
clad
in
the
rough
sheepskin
coats
had
their
place
also
in
their
toilet
and
a
material
made
of
wool
and
horsehair
furnished
them
with
caps
and
felt
for
covering
their
wagons
the
dress
was
distinguished
from
the
simply
by
its
greater
length
and
they
often
rode
like
the
men
astride
their
horses
their
faces
protected
by
a
white
veil
crossing
the
nose
just
below
the
eyes
and
descending
to
the
breast
immense
size
and
flat
noses
were
the
great
desiderata
among
them
marriage
was
a
mere
bargain
and
daughters
were
generally
sold
to
the
highest
bidder
though
expert
hunters
the
tartars
were
scarcely
what
we
should
call
sportsmen
they
hunted
on
the
system
spreading
themselves
in
a
wide
circle
and
gradually
contracting
this
as
they
drove
the
game
before
them
until
the
unfortunate
animals
being
penned
in
in
a
small
space
they
were
easily
shot
down
by
wholesale
hawking
was
also
in
vogue
among
the
tartars
and
was
reduced
as
much
to
a
science
as
in
europe
they
strenuously
punished
great
crimes
with
death
as
for
instance
murder
theft
adultery
and
even
minor
offences
against
chastity
this
however
was
less
the
consequence
of
a
regard
for
virtue
than
of
a
vivid
perception
of
the
rights
of
property
no
code
but
the
jewish
and
the
christian
ever
protected
the
honor
of
women
for
its
own
sake
in
mourning
for
the
dead
it
is
strange
that
violent
howling
and
lamentation
even
on
the
part
of
those
not
personally
concerned
should
be
a
form
common
to
almost
all
nations
not
only
of
different
religions
but
of
various
and
races
the
tartars
as
well
as
the
celts
practised
it
rubruquis
mentions
that
they
made
various
monuments
over
the
graves
of
their
dead
sometimes
mere
mounds
or
barrows
of
earth
or
towers
of
brick
and
even
of
stone
though
no
stone
was
to
be
found
near
the
spot
and
sometimes
large
open
spaces
paved
with
stone
with
four
large
stones
placed
upright
at
the
corners
always
facing
the
four
cardinal
points
it
was
during
winter
that
the
envoy
arrived
at
the
court
or
encampment
of
he
says
that
it
was
at
the
distance
of
twenty
journey
from
cataya
or
cathay
china
but
it
is
difficult
to
say
exactly
where
that
was
here
rubruquis
found
a
number
of
nestorian
priests
peacefully
living
under
the
protection
and
among
them
one
who
had
only
arrived
a
month
before
the
franciscan
friar
and
said
he
had
come
in
consequence
of
a
vision
to
convert
the
khan
and
his
people
he
was
an
armenian
from
the
holy
land
our
missionary
describes
him
thus
in
his
terse
direct
way
which
has
this
advantage
over
the
and
minute
descriptions
of
our
day
that
we
seem
to
see
the
man
before
us
was
a
monk
somewhat
black
and
lean
clad
with
a
rough
to
the
knees
having
over
it
a
black
cloak
of
bristles
furred
with
spotted
skins
girt
with
iron
under
his
was
tolerant
and
liberal
and
rather
well
disposed
than
otherwise
to
the
christian
religion
his
favorite
wife
whom
he
had
lately
lost
had
been
a
christian
and
so
was
his
first
secretary
but
both
nestorian
christians
the
khan
or
his
servants
who
doubtless
expected
to
be
propitiated
with
the
usual
gifts
if
they
could
only
succeed
in
wearying
out
the
patience
of
the
made
the
envoy
wait
nine
days
for
an
audience
the
tartars
thought
it
strange
that
a
ambassador
should
come
to
court
but
a
boy
a
hungarian
captive
again
gave
the
required
and
explanation
before
entering
the
large
hall
whose
entrance
was
closed
by
curtains
of
felt
the
monks
were
searched
to
see
if
they
carried
any
concealed
arms
and
then
the
procession
formed
the
christian
missionaries
entering
the
presence
singing
the
hymn
solis
ortus
the
khan
like
the
lesser
chieftains
rubruquis
had
already
met
was
seated
on
a
or
divan
dressed
a
spotted
skin
or
fur
bright
and
the
multitudinous
bowings
and
prostrations
in
use
at
the
chinese
court
were
very
likely
exacted
though
the
envoy
says
in
general
terms
that
had
to
bend
the
such
simplicity
is
however
very
far
from
the
ceremonious
oriental
ideal
of
homage
and
it
was
not
then
as
it
is
now
esteemed
an
honor
to
receive
frankish
envoys
in
the
frankish
manner
mandchu
first
offered
his
guests
a
drink
of
fermented
milk
of
which
they
partook
sparingly
not
to
offend
him
but
the
interpreter
soon
made
himself
unfit
for
his
office
by
his
indulgence
in
his
favorite
beverage
rubruquis
stated
his
mission
with
modest
simplicity
in
his
quality
of
ambassador
he
might
have
resented
the
delay
in
receiving
him
he
might
have
complained
of
the
familiarity
and
want
of
respect
with
which
he
had
been
often
treated
and
of
the
advantage
taken
of
his
gentleness
and
ignorance
of
the
language
to
plunder
him
but
he
was
more
than
a
messenger
he
was
intent
upon
preaching
the
to
the
tartars
and
only
used
human
means
to
compass
a
divine
end
he
acknowledged
that
he
had
no
rich
presents
nor
temporal
goods
to
offer
but
only
spiritual
benefits
to
impart
his
practice
certainly
did
not
belie
his
theory
the
people
never
disbelieved
him
nor
suspected
him
of
being
a
political
emissary
but
still
he
was
unsuccessful
he
soon
perceived
that
his
interpreter
was
blundering
and
says
easily
found
he
was
drunk
and
himself
was
drunk
also
as
i
all
he
could
obtain
was
leave
to
remain
in
the
country
during
the
cold
season
inquiries
met
him
on
all
sides
as
to
the
wealth
and
state
of
europe
but
of
religion
beyond
the
few
forms
that
pleased
their
eye
the
people
did
not
seem
to
think
they
looked
down
with
lofty
indifference
on
the
faith
of
those
various
adventurers
whom
their
sovereign
kindly
sheltered
and
ranked
the
christian
priests
they
already
knew
in
the
same
category
with
conjurers
and
quack
doctors
the
christianity
of
these
nestorians
was
even
more
imperfect
than
that
of
the
abyssinians
at
the
time
of
the
late
english
invasion
of
the
unlucky
king
dominions
rubruquis
was
horrified
to
find
in
these
priests
mere
superstitious
mountebanks
they
mingled
tartar
rites
with
corrupt
ceremonies
of
the
catholic
church
and
practised
all
manner
of
deceptions
mixing
rhubarb
with
holy
water
as
a
medicinal
drink
and
carrying
to
the
bedside
of
the
sick
lances
and
swords
from
their
sheaths
along
with
the
crucifix
upon
these
grounds
they
pretended
to
the
power
of
working
miracles
and
curing
the
sick
by
spiritual
means
alone
the
franciscan
zealously
tried
to
reform
these
abuses
and
to
convert
the
nestorians
before
he
undertook
to
preach
to
the
tartars
but
here
again
he
was
unsuccessful
the
of
these
debased
men
was
in
question
and
truth
was
little
to
them
in
comparison
with
the
comfort
and
consideration
they
enjoyed
as
leeches
a
curious
scene
occurred
while
at
this
encampment
of
the
khan
there
were
many
mahometans
in
the
country
and
the
sovereign
with
impartial
tolerance
protected
them
and
their
commerce
as
he
did
the
person
and
property
of
other
refugees
they
the
christians
and
some
representative
tartars
were
all
assembled
one
day
by
order
of
mandchu
to
discuss
in
public
the
merits
of
their
respective
faiths
but
even
on
this
occasion
no
bitterness
was
evinced
and
the
meeting
though
it
turned
out
useless
in
a
spiritual
sense
ended
in
a
friendly
banquet
rubruquis
did
his
best
to
improve
this
opportunity
of
teaching
the
truth
but
the
hour
of
successful
evangelization
had
not
yet
struck
and
much
of
the
indifference
of
the
tartars
is
to
be
attributed
to
the
culpable
practices
of
the
nestorians
whose
behavior
was
enough
to
discredit
the
religion
they
pretended
to
profess
but
if
the
missionary
notwithstanding
all
his
zeal
was
unable
to
convert
the
heathens
he
at
least
comforted
and
strengthened
many
captive
christians
we
have
already
mentioned
a
few
of
these
and
in
camp
he
met
with
another
a
woman
from
metz
in
lorraine
who
had
been
taken
prisoner
in
hungary
and
been
carried
back
into
their
own
country
by
the
invaders
she
had
at
first
suffered
many
hardships
but
ended
by
marrying
a
young
russian
a
captive
like
herself
who
was
skilful
in
the
art
of
building
wooden
houses
the
tartars
prized
this
kind
of
knowledge
and
were
kind
to
the
young
couple
who
were
now
leading
a
tolerably
comfortable
life
and
had
a
family
of
three
children
to
fancy
their
joy
at
seeing
a
genuine
christian
missionary
is
almost
out
of
our
power
in
these
days
of
swift
communication
when
nothing
is
any
longer
a
marvel
but
if
we
could
put
ourselves
in
their
place
we
might
paint
a
wonderful
picture
of
thankfulness
surprise
and
simple
faith
the
latter
part
of
lent
was
spent
in
travelling
as
the
khan
broke
up
his
encampment
and
went
on
across
a
chain
of
mountains
to
a
great
city
karakorum
or
karakûm
on
the
river
orchon
every
vestige
of
such
a
city
has
disappeared
centuries
ago
but
marco
polo
mentions
it
and
describes
its
streets
situation
defences
etc
he
arrived
there
nearly
twenty
years
later
and
noticed
that
it
was
surrounded
by
a
strong
rampart
of
earth
there
being
no
good
supply
of
stone
in
those
parts
the
passage
of
the
changai
mountains
was
a
terrible
undertaking
the
cold
was
intense
and
the
weather
stormy
and
the
khan
with
his
usual
bland
eclecticism
begged
rubruquis
to
to
god
in
his
own
for
milder
weather
chiefly
for
the
sake
of
the
cattle
on
palm
sunday
the
envoy
blessed
the
he
saw
on
his
way
though
he
says
there
were
no
buds
on
them
yet
but
they
were
near
the
city
now
and
the
weather
had
become
more
promising
rubruquis
had
his
eyes
wide
open
as
he
came
to
the
first
organized
city
of
the
tartars
as
marco
polo
affirms
this
to
have
been
it
had
scarcely
been
built
twenty
years
when
our
monk
visited
it
and
owed
its
origin
to
the
son
and
successor
of
were
two
grand
streets
in
it
says
rubruquis
of
the
saracens
where
the
fairs
are
kept
held
and
many
merchants
resort
thither
and
one
other
street
of
the
cathayans
chinese
who
are
all
many
of
the
latter
were
captives
or
at
least
subjects
of
the
khan
for
the
tartars
had
already
conquered
the
greater
part
of
northern
china
the
khan
lived
in
a
castle
or
palace
outside
the
earthen
rampart
in
karakorum
again
the
monk
found
many
christians
armenian
georgian
hungarian
and
even
of
western
european
origin
among
others
he
mentions
an
englishman
whom
he
calls
basilicus
and
who
had
been
born
in
hungary
and
a
few
germans
but
the
most
important
personage
of
foreign
birth
was
a
french
goldsmith
william
bouchier
whose
wife
was
a
hungarian
but
of
mahometan
parentage
this
benvenuto
cellini
of
the
east
was
rich
and
liberal
an
excellent
interpreter
thoroughly
at
home
in
the
tartar
dialects
a
skilful
artist
and
in
high
favor
at
court
he
had
just
finished
a
masterpiece
of
mechanism
and
beauty
which
rubruquis
thus
minutely
describes
the
palace
because
it
was
unseemly
to
carry
about
bottles
of
milk
and
other
drinks
there
master
william
made
him
a
great
silver
tree
at
the
root
whereof
were
four
silver
lions
having
each
one
pipe
through
which
flowed
pure
milk
and
four
other
pipes
were
conveyed
within
the
body
of
the
tree
unto
the
top
thereof
and
the
tops
spread
back
again
downwards
and
upon
every
one
of
them
was
a
golden
serpent
whose
tails
twined
about
the
body
of
the
tree
and
one
of
these
pipes
ran
with
wine
another
with
another
with
a
drink
made
of
honey
and
another
with
a
drink
made
of
rice
between
the
pipes
at
the
top
of
the
tree
he
made
an
angel
holding
a
trumpet
and
under
the
tree
a
hollow
vault
wherein
a
man
might
be
hid
and
a
pipe
ascended
from
this
vault
through
the
tree
to
the
angel
he
first
made
bellows
but
they
gave
not
wind
enough
without
the
palace
walls
there
was
a
chamber
wherein
the
several
drinks
were
brought
and
there
were
servants
there
ready
to
pour
them
out
when
they
heard
the
angel
sounding
his
trumpet
and
the
boughs
of
the
tree
were
of
silver
and
the
leaves
and
the
fruit
when
therefore
they
want
drink
the
crieth
to
the
angel
that
he
sound
the
trumpet
then
he
hearing
who
is
hid
in
the
vault
bloweth
the
pipe
which
goeth
to
the
angel
and
the
angel
sets
his
trumpet
to
his
mouth
and
the
trumpet
soundeth
very
shrill
then
the
servants
which
are
in
the
chamber
hearing
each
of
them
poureth
forth
his
drink
into
its
proper
pipe
and
all
the
pipes
pour
them
forth
from
above
and
they
are
received
below
in
vessels
prepared
for
that
this
elaborate
piece
of
plate
makes
one
think
rather
of
the
xvith
century
banquets
of
the
medici
and
the
este
than
of
feastings
given
by
a
nomad
tartar
in
the
wilds
of
central
asia
the
goldsmith
was
not
unknown
to
fame
even
in
europe
where
he
was
called
william
of
paris
several
old
chroniclers
speak
of
him
and
his
brother
roger
was
well
known
as
a
goldsmith
upon
the
great
bridge
at
this
clever
artist
very
nearly
fell
a
victim
to
the
quackery
of
a
nestorian
monk
whereupon
rubruquis
significantly
comments
thus
entreated
him
to
proceed
either
as
an
apostle
doing
miracles
indeed
by
virtue
of
prayer
or
to
administer
his
potion
as
a
physician
according
to
the
art
of
besides
the
tartars
and
their
christian
captives
rubruquis
had
opportunities
of
observing
the
numerous
chinese
or
cathayans
as
they
were
called
who
have
been
mentioned
as
the
artificers
of
the
town
there
were
also
knots
of
siberians
kamtchatkans
and
even
inhabitants
of
the
islands
between
the
extremities
of
asia
and
america
where
at
times
the
sea
was
frozen
over
rubruquis
picked
up
a
good
deal
of
miscellaneous
information
chiefly
about
the
chinese
he
mentions
their
paper
currency
a
fact
which
marco
polo
subsequently
verified
and
their
mode
of
writing
with
small
and
each
character
or
figure
signifying
a
whole
word
the
standard
of
value
of
the
russians
he
says
consisted
in
spotted
furs
a
currency
which
still
exists
in
the
remoter
parts
of
siberia
it
was
not
without
good
reason
no
doubt
that
the
made
up
his
mind
to
leave
the
country
he
had
hoped
either
to
evangelize
or
to
find
already
as
orthodox
as
his
own
and
ruled
by
a
great
christian
potentate
such
perseverance
as
he
showed
throughout
his
journey
was
not
likely
to
be
daunted
by
slight
obstacles
but
finding
the
object
of
his
mission
as
far
from
attainment
as
when
he
first
entered
tartary
he
at
last
reluctantly
left
the
field
only
one
european
besides
himself
had
ventured
so
far
friar
bartholomew
of
cremona
but
even
he
shrank
before
a
renewal
of
the
hardships
of
mountain
and
desert
travel
and
chose
rather
to
stay
behind
with
master
william
the
hospitable
goldsmith
till
some
more
convenient
opportunity
should
present
itself
of
returning
to
his
own
country
rubruquis
accordingly
started
alone
with
a
servant
an
interpreter
and
a
guide
but
though
he
had
asked
for
leave
to
go
on
whitsunday
the
permission
was
delayed
till
the
festival
of
john
baptist
the
of
june
the
khan
made
him
a
few
trifling
presents
and
gave
him
a
complimentary
letter
to
the
king
of
france
but
no
definite
results
were
obtained
the
homeward
journey
was
long
and
tedious
and
the
only
provision
made
for
the
sustenance
of
the
party
was
a
permission
from
the
khan
to
take
a
sheep
in
four
days
wherever
they
could
find
sometimes
they
had
nothing
to
eat
for
three
days
together
and
only
a
little
cosmos
to
drink
and
more
than
once
having
missed
the
stations
of
the
wandering
tribes
whom
they
had
reckoned
on
meeting
even
the
supply
of
cosmos
was
exhausted
about
two
months
after
his
departure
from
karakorum
rubruquis
met
sartach
the
great
chief
who
had
sheltered
him
for
some
time
on
his
way
to
the
river
don
some
belongings
of
the
mission
having
been
left
in
care
the
envoy
asked
him
to
return
them
but
was
told
they
were
in
charge
of
baatu
other
friend
and
protector
sartach
was
on
his
way
to
join
and
was
of
course
surrounded
by
the
two
hundred
houses
and
innumerable
chests
which
belonged
to
the
establishment
of
a
tartar
patriarch
if
this
was
not
exactly
civilization
it
was
companionship
and
the
envoy
must
have
been
glad
of
a
meeting
which
replenished
his
exhausted
stores
and
suggested
domestic
comfort
and
abundance
more
rough
travelling
on
horseback
more
experiences
of
hunger
and
cold
for
the
autumn
was
already
coming
on
more
fording
of
rivers
and
the
monk
found
himself
at
court
it
was
the
of
september
a
year
after
he
had
left
the
chieftain
to
push
on
to
the
court
of
the
here
he
was
joyfully
and
courteously
received
and
recovered
nearly
all
his
property
but
as
the
tartars
had
concluded
that
the
whole
embassy
must
have
perished
long
ago
they
had
allowed
some
nestorian
priest
a
wanderer
under
the
protection
now
of
sartach
now
of
baatu
and
other
khans
to
appropriate
various
psalters
books
and
ecclesiastical
vestments
three
young
men
europeans
whom
rubruquis
had
left
behind
had
nearly
been
reduced
to
bondage
under
the
same
pretext
but
they
had
not
suffered
personal
the
kind
offices
of
some
influential
armenians
had
staved
off
the
evil
day
and
the
timely
arrival
of
the
envoy
secured
them
their
freedom
rubruquis
now
joined
court
which
was
journeying
westward
to
a
town
called
sarai
on
the
eastern
bank
of
the
volga
but
the
progress
of
the
encumbered
tartars
was
so
slow
that
he
left
them
after
a
companionship
and
pushed
on
with
his
party
till
he
reached
sarai
on
the
feast
of
all
saints
after
this
the
country
was
almost
an
unbroken
desert
but
our
traveller
once
more
fell
in
with
one
of
his
tartar
friends
a
son
of
sartach
who
was
out
upon
a
hawking
expedition
and
gave
him
a
guard
to
protect
him
from
various
fierce
mahometan
tribes
that
infested
the
neighborhood
here
ended
his
travels
in
tartary
proper
but
his
hardships
were
far
from
ended
yet
through
armenia
and
the
territories
of
turkish
and
koordish
princes
he
journeyed
slowly
and
uncomfortably
in
dread
of
the
violence
of
his
own
guides
and
guards
as
well
as
of
the
insults
of
the
populations
whose
country
he
traversed
he
says
these
delays
in
part
from
the
difficulty
of
procuring
horses
but
chiefly
because
the
guide
chose
to
stop
often
for
three
days
together
in
one
place
for
his
own
business
and
though
much
dissatisfied
i
durst
not
complain
as
he
might
have
slain
me
and
those
with
me
or
sold
us
all
for
slaves
and
there
was
none
to
hinder
journeying
across
asia
minor
and
over
mount
taurus
he
took
ship
at
last
for
cyprus
here
he
learnt
that
louis
who
had
been
in
the
holy
land
at
the
time
of
his
departure
had
gone
back
to
france
he
would
very
much
have
wished
to
deliver
his
letters
and
presents
of
silk
pelisses
and
furs
to
the
king
in
person
but
this
was
not
granted
him
the
provincial
of
his
order
whom
he
met
at
cyprus
desired
him
to
write
his
account
and
send
his
gifts
to
the
king
and
as
in
those
days
there
was
creeping
in
among
the
monks
a
habit
of
restless
wandering
his
superior
who
was
it
seems
a
reformer
and
strict
disciplinarian
tried
the
obedience
and
humility
of
the
famous
traveller
by
sending
him
to
his
convent
at
acre
whence
by
the
order
he
had
started
rubruquis
stood
the
test
but
could
not
forbear
imploring
the
king
by
writing
to
use
his
influence
with
the
provincial
to
allow
him
a
short
stay
in
france
and
one
audience
of
his
royal
master
little
is
known
of
the
great
traveller
and
pioneer
after
this
and
whether
he
ever
got
leave
to
see
the
king
is
doubtful
he
fell
back
into
obscurity
and
it
is
presumed
that
marco
polo
did
not
even
know
of
his
previous
travels
over
the
same
ground
as
the
polos
explored
no
record
of
his
embassy
remained
but
the
latin
letter
addressed
to
louis
and
even
in
france
his
fame
was
unknown
for
many
centuries
it
was
not
till
after
the
invention
of
printing
that
his
adventures
became
fairly
known
to
the
literary
world
although
roger
bacon
one
of
his
own
order
had
given
a
spirited
abstract
of
his
travels
in
one
of
his
works
this
too
was
in
latin
and
after
a
time
became
a
sealed
book
to
the
vulgar
so
that
it
was
not
at
least
till
the
year
that
the
old
name
was
again
known
of
voyages
and
contains
an
english
translation
of
letter
and
years
later
purchas
reproduced
it
from
a
copy
found
in
a
college
library
at
cambridge
bergeron
a
french
priest
put
it
into
french
not
from
the
original
but
from
english
version
since
then
rubruquis
has
taken
his
place
among
the
few
famous
voyagers
of
olden
times
but
from
the
vagueness
of
his
language
the
lack
of
geographical
science
in
his
day
and
perhaps
also
the
mistakes
of
careless
copyists
it
is
not
easy
to
trace
his
course
upon
the
map
one
fact
however
he
ascertained
and
insisted
upon
which
a
geographical
society
had
it
existed
in
his
time
would
have
been
glad
to
register
together
with
an
honorable
mention
of
the
discoverer
the
nature
of
the
great
lake
called
the
caspian
sea
the
old
greeks
had
correctly
called
it
an
sea
but
an
idea
had
since
prevailed
that
it
possessed
some
communication
with
the
northern
ocean
rubruquis
proved
the
contrary
but
no
attention
was
paid
to
his
single
assertion
and
books
of
geography
compiled
at
home
from
ancient
maps
and
without
a
reference
however
distant
to
the
recorded
by
adventurous
men
who
had
seen
foreign
shores
with
their
eyes
calmly
continued
to
propagate
the
old
error
a
paraphrase
from
the
greek
οὐκ
ἔθανες
πρώτη
τ
protê
thou
didst
not
die
but
thou
didst
fly
when
we
saw
thee
no
more
to
a
sunnier
clime
in
the
isles
of
the
blest
in
the
golden
west
where
thy
spirit

springs
joyous
and
light
the
verdurous
floor
that
is
strewn
evermore
with
blossoms
that
fade
not
nor
droop
from
their
prime
thou
hast
made
thee
a
home
where
no
sorrow
shall
come
no
cloud
overshadow
thy
noon
of
delight
cold
or

shall
not
vex
thee

nor

no

thou
hast
cherished
the

that

for

or

thy

shall
fret
but
thy
joy
hath
no
stain
thy
remembrance
no
pain
and
the
heights
that
we
guess
at
thy
sunshine
makes
plain
the
law
of
god
and
the
regulations
of
society
summary
considerations
on
law
from
the
french
of
the
comte
de
breda
are
laws
for
the
society
of
ants
and
of
bees
how
could
any
one
suppose
that
there
are
none
for
human
society
and
that
it
is
left
to
the
chance
of
inventing
them
the
modern
state
never
before
was
liberty
so
much
talked
about
never
before
was
the
very
idea
of
it
so
utterly
lost
tyrants
have
been
destroyed
it
is
said
this
is
a
false
assertion
it
may
be
or
rather
is
it
not
certain
that
it
has
become
more
difficult
for
a
sovereign
to
govern
tyrannically
but
tyranny
is
not
dead
quite
the
contrary
all
unlimited
power
is
of
its
own
nature
tyrannical
now
it
is
such
a
power
that
the
modern
state
desires
to
wield
the
state
is
held
up
to
us
as
the
supreme
arbiter
of
good
and
evil
and
if
we
believe
its
defenders
it
can
not
err
its
laws
being
in
every
case
and
at
all
times
binding
people
have
banished
god
from
the
government
of
human
society
but
they
have
made
to
themselves
a
new
god
despotic
and
blind
without
hearing
and
without
voice
whose
power
knows
how
to
reach
its
slaves
as
well
in
the
temple
as
in
the
public
places
as
well
in
the
palace
as
in
the
humblest
cot
what
is
there
indeed
more
divine
than
not
to
do
wrong
god
alone
speaking
to
the
human
conscience
either
directly
or
by
his
representatives
is
the
infallible
judge
of
good
and
evil
no
human
power
whatsoever
can
declare
all
that
emanates
from
it
to
be
necessarily
right
without
usurping
the
place
of
god
and
declaring
itself
the
sovereign
master
of
the
soul
as
well
as
of
the
body
the
last
refuge
of
the
slaves
of
antiquity
the
human
conscience
would
no
longer
exist
for
the
people
of
modern
times
if
it
were
true
that
every
law
is
binding
from
the
mere
fact
of
its
promulgation
hence
the
modern
state
but
lately
so
boastful
has
begun
to
waver
and
to
doubt
its
own
powers
it
encounters
two
principal
obstacles
as
unlike
in
their
form
as
in
their
origin
on
one
hand
it
beholds
catholics
sustained
by
their
knowledge
of
law
its
origin
and
its
essence
resisting
passively
and
preparing
themselves
to
submit
to
persecutions
without
even
shrinking
on
the
other
it
meets
in
these
our
days
the
most
formidable
insurrections
there
are
multitudes
blind
as
the
state
representatives
but
excusable
inasmuch
as
their
rebellion
is
against
an
authority
which
owes
its
sway
only
to
caprice
or
theory
who
reply
thus
to
power
are
as
good
as
you
you
have
no
right
over
us
other
than
that
of
brute
force
we
will
endeavor
to
oppose
you
with
a
strength
equal
to
yours
and
when
we
shall
have
gained
the
victory
we
will
make
new
laws
and
new
constitutions
wherein
all
that
you
call
lawful
shall
be
called
unlawful
and
all
that
you
consider
crime
shall
be
deemed
if
it
were
true
that
law
could
spring
only
from
the
human
will
these
madmen
would
be
reasonable
in
the
extreme
thus
the
state
is
powerless
against
them
it
drags
on
an
uncertain
existence
constantly
threatened
with
the
most
terrible
social
wars
and
enjoying
a
momentary
peace
only
on
condition
of
never
laying
down
arms
modern
armies
are
standing
ones
the
modern
police
have
become
veritable
armies
and
they
sleep
neither
day
nor
night
at
this
price
do
our
states
exist
trade
grow
rich
and
become
satisfied
with
themselves
these
constant
commotions
are
not
alone
the
vengeance
of
the
living
god
disowned
and
outraged
they
are
also
the
inevitable
consequence
of
that
extremity
of
pride
and
folly
which
has
induced
human
assemblies
to
believe
that
it
belongs
to
them
to
decide
finally
between
right
and
wrong
in
truth
god
is
not
the
author
of
law
there
is
no
law
really
we
may
for
the
love
of
god
obey
existing
powers
even
though
they
be
illegitimate
but
this
submission
has
its
limits
it
must
cease
the
moment
that
the
human
law
prescribes
anything
contrary
to
the
law
of
god
as
for
people
without
faith
we
would
in
vain
seek
for
a
motive
powerful
enough
to
induce
them
to
submit
to
anything
displeasing
to
them
modern
liberty
the
people
of
our
generation
consider
themselves
more
free
more
unrestrained
than
those
who
have
gone
before
them
it
is
not
to
our
generation
however
that
the
glory
accrues
of
having
first
thrown
off
the
yoke
our
moderns
themselves
acknowledge
that
they
have
had
predecessors
and
they
agree
with
us
in
declaring
that
new
made
its
appearance
in
the
world
about
the
xvith
century
in
truth
the
only
yoke
which
has
been
cast
off
since
then
is
that
of
god
which
seemed
too
heavy
all
at
once
thought
pronounced
itself
freed
from
the
shackles
of
ecclesiastical
authority
but
at
the
outset
it
was
far
from
intended
to
deny
the
idea
of
a
divine
right
superior
to
all
human
right
despite
the
historical
falsehoods
which
have
found
utterance
in
our
day
it
was
chiefly
princes
who
propagated
protestantism
and
most
often
they
attained
their
end
only
by
violence
when
successful
they
added
to
their
temporal
title
a
religious
one
they
made
themselves
bishops
or
popes
and
thus
became
all
the
more
powerful
over
their
subjects
there
was
no
longer
any
refuge
from
the
abuse
of
power
of
the
rulers
of
this
world
for
it
was
the
interest
of
these
despots
to
call
themselves
the
representatives
of
god
by
means
of
this
title
they
secularized
dioceses
convents
the
goods
of
the
church
and
even
the
ministers
of
their
new
religion
this
term
was
then
used
to
express
in
polite
language
an
idea
of
spoliation
and
of
hypocritical
and
uncurbed
tyranny
the
moderns
have
gone
farther
they
have
attempted
to
secularize
law
itself
this
time
again
the
word
hides
a
thought
which
if
it
were
openly
expressed
would
shock
the
law
has
become
atheistical
and
not
all
the
opposition
which
the
harshness
of
this
statement
has
aroused
can
prevent
it
from
still
expressing
a
truth
the
inexorable
logic
of
facts
leads
directly
from
the
reformation
to
the
revolution
princes
themselves
sowed
the
seeds
of
revolt
which
will
yet
despoil
them
of
their
power
and
their
thrones
while
as
for
the
people
they
have
gained
nothing
they
are
constantly
tyrannized
over
but
their
real
masters
are
unknown
and
their
only
resource
against
the
encroachments
or
the
abuse
of
power
is
an
appeal
to
arms
it
is
not
then
true
that
liberty
finds
greater
space
in
the
modern
world
than
in
the
ancient
christian
world
to
prove
this
i
need
but
a
single
fact
which
has
direct
relation
with
my
subject
while
europe
was
still
enveloped
in
darkness
of
the
middle
ages
catholic
theologians
freely
taught
from
all
their
chairs
that
unjust
law
is
no
injusta
non
est
now
are
there
at
the
present
day
many
pulpits
from
which
this
principle
the
safeguard
of
all
liberty
and
of
all
independence
the
protector
of
all
rights
and
the
defence
of
the
helpless
might
be
proclaimed
with
impunity
do
we
not
see
the
prohibitions
the
lawsuits
the
comme
which
the
boldness
of
such
a
maxim
would
call
forth
human
governments
have
changed
in
form
but
their
tyranny
has
not
ceased
to
grow
and
the
free
men
of
the
olden
society
have
become
the
slaves
in
a
new
order
of
things
they
have
even
reached
a
point
at
which
they
know
not
even
in
what
liberty
consists
divine
origin
of
law
i
know
and
i
hear
beforehand
the
response
which
the
doctors
of
modern
rights
will
here
give
me
say
they
is
very
true
that
the
catholic
church
has
always
claimed
the
right
of
judging
laws
and
of
refusing
obedience
to
such
as
displeased
her
but
in
this
is
precisely
the
worst
abuse
that
which
would
domineer
over
human
reason
the
sovereign
of
the
world
is
tyranny
this
in
truth
is
the
special
mark
of
catholicity
and
it
is
this
which
has
ever
made
it
the
religion
of
the
ignorant
and
the
is
then
the
maxim
i
have
just
recalled
the
invention
of
catholic
theologians
is
it
true
that
the
teachers
of
the
ultramontane
doctrine
alone
have
contended
that
the
intrinsic
worth
of
a
law
must
be
sought
beyond
and
above
them
beyond
and
above
the
human
power
which
proclaims
it
not
only
has
this
elementary
principle
not
been
devised
by
our
theologians
but
even
the
pagan
philosophers
themselves
had
reached
it
cicero
but
summed
up
the
teaching
universally
received
by
philosophers
worthy
of
the
name
when
he
said
that
the
science
of
law
should
not
be
sought
in
the
edicts
of
the
pretor
nor
even
in
the
laws
of
the
twelve
tables
and
that
the
most
profound
philosophy
alone
could
aid
in
judging
laws
and
teaching
us
their
value
this
is
not
to
degrade
reason
which
this
same
cicero
has
defined
or
rather
described
in
admirable
language
he
found
therein
something
grand
something
sublime
he
declared
that
it
is
more
fit
to
command
than
to
obey
that
it
values
little
what
is
merely
human
that
it
is
gifted
with
a
peculiar
elevation
which
nothing
daunts
which
yields
to
no
one
and
which
is
unconquerable
but
remark
it
is
only
with
regard
to
human
powers
and
allurements
that
reason
shows
itself
so
exalted
and
haughty
it
requires
something
greater
than
man
to
make
it
submit
and
it
only
god
or
his
delegates
said
plato
to
clinias
the
cretan
do
you
consider
the
first
author
of
your
laws
it
a
god
is
it
a
man
replied
clinias
is
a
god
we
could
not
rightly
accord
this
title
to
any
so
also
tradition
tells
us
that
minos
went
every
ninth
day
to
consult
jupiter
his
father
whose
replies
he
committed
to
writing
lycurgus
wished
to
have
his
laws
confirmed
by
the
delphian
apollo
and
this
god
replied
that
he
would
dictate
them
himself
at
rome
the
nymph
egeria
played
the
same
with
numa
everywhere
is
felt
the
necessity
of
seeking
above
man
the
title
in
virtue
of
which
he
may
command
his
if
we
turn
now
from
the
fabulous
traditions
of
the
ancient
world
we
still
find
an
absolute
truth
proclaimed
by
its
sages
one
that
affirms
the
existence
of
an
eternal
law
which
was
called
the
natural
law
and
which
serves
as
a
criterion
whereby
to
judge
the
worth
of
the
laws
promulgated
by
man
cicero
declares
it
absurd
to
consider
right
everything
set
down
in
the
constitutions
or
the
laws
and
he
is
careful
to
add
that
neither
is
public
opinion
any
more
competent
to
determine
the
right
the
sovereign
law
therefore
that
which
no
human
law
may
violate
without
the
penalty
of
becoming
void
has
god
himself
for
its
author
the
laws
of
states
may
be
unjust
and
abominable
and
by
consequence
bind
no
one

on
the

law
the
source
and
measure
of
other
laws
originating
before
all
ages
before
any
law
had
been
written
or
any
city
built
this
doctrine
to
support
which
i
have
designedly
cited
only
pagan
authors
is
also
that
of
catholic
theologians
for
example
thomas
and
suarez
but
the
philosophical
school
of
the
last
century
has
so
perverted
the
meaning
of
the
term
law
of
that
certain
catholic
authors
de
bonald
for
instance
have
scrupled
to
use
the
consecrated
term
it
is
necessary
then
to
explain
its
true
sense
natural
law
according
to
pagan
philosophers
the
nature
of
a
being
is
that
which
constitutes
its
fitness
to
attain
its
end
the
idea
therefore
which
a
person
has
of
the
nature
of
man
by
consequence
determines
that
which
he
will
have
of
his
end
and
hence
of
the
rule
which
should
govern
his
actions
the
materialists
for
example
who
deny
the
immortality
of
the
soul
and
whose
horizon
is
bounded
by
the
limits
of
the
present
life
are
able
to
teach
only
a
purely
epicurean
or
utilitarian
morality
they
can
not
consistently
plead
a
motive
higher
than
an
immediate
or
at
least
a
proximate
for
what
is
more
uncertain
than
the
duration
of
our
life
in
the
strikingly
language
of
the
xviiith
century
state
of
was
a
hypothetical
state
at
once
innocent
and
barbarous
anterior
to
all
society
it
is
to
society
that
this
theory
attributes
the
disorders
of
man
and
the
loss
of
certain
primitive
and
inalienable
rights
which
the
sect
of
boasted
of
having
regained
and
by
the
conquest
whereof
the
corrupted
and
doting
france
of
was
prostrated
the
philosophers
of
antiquity
on
the
contrary
notwithstanding
their
numerous
errors
and
despite
the
polytheism
which
they
exteriorly
professed
had
arrived
at
so
profound
a
knowledge
of
man
and
his
nature
that
the
fathers
and
doctors
of
the
church
have
often
spoken
of
the
discoveries
of
their
intellect
as
a
kind
of
made
to
them
by
god
we
have
already
heard
cicero
say
that
the
natural
law
is
eternal
and
superior
to
all
human
laws
i
shall
continue
to
quote
him
because
of
his
clearness
and
because
he
admirably
sums
up
the
teaching
of
the
philosophers
who
preceded
him
the
sound
philosophy
which
should
guide
us
according
to
him
the
science
of
law
teaches
us
that
it
is
far
more
sublime
to
submit
to
the
divine
mind
to
the
god
than
to
the
emperors
and
mighty
ones
of
this
earth
for
it
is
a
kind
of
partnership
between
god
and
man
right
reason
is
the
same
for
the
one
and
the
other
and
law
being
nothing
else
than
right
reason
it
may
be
said
that
one
same
law
links
us
with
the
gods
now
the
common
law
is
also
the
common
right
and
when
people
have
a
common
right
they
belong
in
some
manner
to
the
same
country
we
must
then
consider
this
world
as
a
country
common
to
the
gods
and
to
men
man
is
in
truth
like
to
god
and
for
what
end
has
god
created
and
gifted
man
like
to
himself
that
he
may
arrive
at
justice
human
society
is
bound
by
one
same
right
and
law
is
the
same
for
all
this
law
is
the
just
motive
the
right
reason
of
all
precepts
and
prohibitions
he
who
is
ignorant
of
it
whether
written
or
not
knows
not
justice
if
uprightness
consisted
in
submission
to
the
written
laws
and
constitutions
of
nations
and
if
as
some
pretend
utility
could
be
the
measure
of
good
he
who
expected
to
profit
thereby
would
be
justified
in
neglecting
or
violating
the
laws
this
remark
is
peculiarly
applicable
to
the
present
time
it
is
precisely
utility
and
the
increase
of
wealth
or
of
comforts
in
a
word
material
interests
which
the
greater
number
of
modern
legislators
have
had
chiefly
in
view
the
result
is
that
society
scarcely
has
the
right
to
feel
indignant
against
those
who
may
deem
it
to
their
advantage
to
disturb
it
religion
say
they
has
nothing
in
common
with
politics
the
state
inasmuch
as
it
is
a
state
need
not
trouble
itself
about
god
the
things
of
this
world
should
be
regulated
with
regard
to
this
world
and
without
reference
to
the
supernatural
suppose
it
so
but
then
in
virtue
of
what
authority
will
you
impose
your
laws
there
is
no
human
power
able
to
bend
or
to
conquer
one
human
will
which
does
not
acknowledge
it
the
basis
of
right
is
the
natural
love
of
our
which
nature
has
planted
within
us
nature
also
commands
us
to
honor
god
it
is
not
fear
which
renders
worship
necessary
it
is
the
bond
which
exists
between
god
and
man
if
popular
or
royal
decrees
could
determine
right
a
whim
of
the
multitude
might
render
lawful
theft
adultery
or
forgery
if
it
be
true
that
a
proclamation
dictated
by
fools
can
change
the
order
of
nature
why
may
not
evil
become
one
day
good
but
the
sages
teach
that
the
human
mind
did
not
invent
law
it
has
its
in
the
bosom
of
god
and
is
with
him
it
is
nothing
else
than
the
unerring
reason
of
jupiter
himself
it
is
reflected
in
the
mind
of
the
wise
man
it
can
never
be
repealed
this
reason
which
comes
to
us
from
the
et
a
numine
deorum
tracta
is
what
is
usually
termed
the
law
and
the
beautiful
language
of
cicero
recalls
this
magnificent
verse
of
the
ivth
psalm
ostendit
nobis
bona
signatum
est
super
nos
lumen
vultus
tui
influence
of
pantheism
on
modern
law
pagan
teaching
how
elevated
soever
it
may
be
is
always
incomplete
and
this
is
evident
even
from
the
words
of
cicero
since
law
comes
from
god
it
is
very
clear
that
it
will
be
known
more
or
less
correctly
according
as
our
idea
of
god
is
more
or
less
correct
this
it
is
that
gives
so
great
a
superiority
first
to
the
law
of
moses
before
the
coming
of
jesus
christ
and
to
all
christian
legislation
since
the
jews
had
not
merely
a
vague
knowledge
of
the
precepts
of
the
divine
law
this
law
in
its
principal
provisions
had
been
directly
revealed
to
them
christians
have
something
better
still
since
the
eternal
word
was
made
man
and
the
word
is
precisely
true
light
which
enlighteneth
every
man
coming
into
this
the
philosophers
of
antiquity
saw
this
light
from
afar
off
we
have
that
of
which
they
merely
affirmed
the
existence
the
jews
contemplated
it
as
through
a
veil
and
awaited
its
coming
it
was
made
flesh
it
brought
us
life
shone
in
the
darkness
but
the
darkness
did
not
comprehend
it
is
not
the
fault
of
the
word
or
of
his
manifestation
says
thomas
on
this
subject
if
there
are
minds
who
see
not
this
light
there
is
here
not
darkness
but
closed
eyes
it
is
god
himself
therefore
whom
man
refuses
to
acknowledge
when
he
rejects
the
fundamental
law
which
alone
deserves
the
name
of
law
human
pride
and
insolence
go
beyond
forgetfulness
or
simple
negation
when
they
have
the
audacity
to
put
a
human
law
in
the
place
of
and
above
the
divine
law
which
last
crime
is
nothing
less
than
the
deification
of
man
this
philosophic
consequence
of
the
secularization
of
the
law
was
inevitable
and
is
openly
displayed
in
modern
doctrines
atheists
properly
so
called
are
rare
but
the
present
generation
is
infected
with
pantheism
now
pantheism
proclaims
without
disguise
and
without
shame
the
divinity
of
man
let
us
add
that
this
error
is
the
only
foundation
upon
which
man
may
logically
rest
to
defend
modern
rights
it
produces
with
regard
to
constitutions
and
laws
two
principal
effects
which
it
suffices
but
to
indicate
that
every
honest
mind
may
at
once
recognize
their
existence
and
their
lamentable
consequences
pantheism
firstly
destroys
individualities
or
as
the
germans
call
them
it
sweeps
them
away
and
causes
them
to
disappear
in
the
great
whole
do
we
not
likewise
see
personality
simple
or
associated
that
is
to
say
individual
liberty
associations
and
corporations
little
by
little
reduced
to
annihilation
by
the
modern
idea
of
the
state
does
not
modern
theory
make
also
of
the
state
another
grand
whole
beside
which
nothing
private
can
exist
to
reach
this
result
they
represent
the
state
as
expressing
the
aggregate
of
all
the
particular
wills
and
they
seek
in
a
pretended
will
the
supreme
and
infallible
source
of
law
but
even
were
this
will
as
general
as
theory
desires
it
would
not
be
the
less
human
or
by
consequence
the
less
subject
to
error
whence
comes
it
then
that
they
make
it
the
sovereign
arbiter
of
good
and
evil
of
truth
and
falsehood
of
justice
and
injustice
the
pantheists
reply
that
is
in
man
and
in
the
world
that
he
is
one
and
the
same
thing
with
the
world
that
he
is
identical
with
the
nature
of
things
and
consequently
subject
to
the
general
will
the
expression
of
the
universal
conscience
is
then
a
manifestation
of
the
divine
will
and
this
would
allow
it
to
change
without
ever
erring
this
answers
all
in
truth
but
it
may
lead
us
too
far
if
as
says
hegel
god
is
subjective
that
is
to
say
if
he
is
in
man
or
more
exactly
still
if
he
is
man
himself
and
the
substance
of
nature
neither
right
nor
law
nor
justice
could
remain
objective
in
other
words
if
man
is
god
there
is
no
longer
any
possible
distinction
between
good
and
evil
and
this
conclusion
has
been
drawn
by
the
learned
german
socialist
lassalle
he
denies
the
notion
of
an
immutable
right
he
is
unwilling
that
we
should
any
longer
speak
of
the
family
property
justice
in
absolute
terms
according
to
him
these
are
but
abstract
and
unreal
generalities
there
have
been
on
all
these
subjects
greek
roman
german
ideas
but
these
are
only
historical
recollections
ideas
change
some
even
disappear
and
if
some
day
the
universal
conscience
should
decide
that
the
idea
of
proprietorship
has
had
its
day
then
would
commence
a
new
era
in
history
during
which
there
could
be
no
longer
either
property
or
proprietors
without
incurring
the
guilt
of
injustice
from
the
of
pantheism
this
reasoning
is
irrefutable
and
on
the
other
hand
we
have
just
seen
that
pantheism
alone
could
justify
the
modern
theory
of
the
general
will
the
supreme
arbiter
of
law
has
the
general
will
ruled
since
i
have
just
quoted
a
socialist
whose
works
though
little
known
in
france
are
of
extreme
importance
ferdinand
lassalle
a
jew
by
birth
by
nationality
a
prussian
is
possessed
of
extensive
knowledge
critical
genius
of
the
highest
order
and
unsparing
logic
we
have
seen
him
draw
the
theoretical
consequences
of
pantheism
applied
to
law
and
it
will
not
be
without
interest
to
know
how
he
judges
the
practical
results
of
the
modern
theory
of
rights
as
shown
in
the
french
revolution
the
socialists
have
a
special
authority
for
speaking
of
for
they
admit
them
without
hesitation
and
their
teaching
proved
that
they
comprehend
them
wonderfully
the
of
the
rights
of
is
the
most
authentic
summing
up
of
these
famous
principles
and
it
is
therein
that
the
modern
theory
of
law
will
be
found
most
clearly
stated
says
art
the
expression
of
the
general
will
every
citizen
has
the
right
of
in
its
formation
either
personally
or
by
his
it
would
seem
from
this
solemn
proclamation
that
since
then
or
at
least
in
the
first
fervor
of
this
revolution
the
majority
of
the
should
have
been
called
to
the
this
has
been
said
it
has
even
been
supported
at
the
mouth
of
the
cannon
for
as
has
been
wittily
remarked
by
de
maistre
masters
of
these
poor
people
have
had
recourse
even
to
artillery
while
deriding
them
they
said
to
them
think
you
do
not
will
this
law
but
be
assured
you
do
will
it
if
you
dare
to
refuse
it
we
will
pour
upon
you
a
shower
of
shot
to
punish
you
for
not
willing
what
you
do
and
it
was
what
then
took
place
and
how
did
it
happen
that
the
general
will
which
had
undertaken
to
make
fundamental
and
irrevocable
laws
should
have
accepted
in
the
first
five
years
of
its
freedom
three
different
constitutions
and
a
like
that
of
the
reign
of
terror
lassalle
replies
that
it
is
not
at
all
the
people
who
made
the
revolution
and
that
the
general
will
was
not
even
asked
to
manifest
itself
he
recalls
the
famous
pamphlet
of
sieyès
and
corrects
its
title
it
is
not
true
says
he
that
the
was
then
nothing
the
increase
of
personal
property
has
since
then
brought
about
a
thanks
to
which
the
was
in
truth
all
but
legally
it
was
nothing
which
was
not
much
to
its
liking
for
the
former
ranks
of
society
still
existed
by
right
although
their
real
strength
was
not
in
keeping
with
their
legal
condition
the
work
of
the
french
revolution
was
therefore
to
give
to
the
a
legal
position
suitable
to
its
actual
importance
now
the
first
and
foremost
assumed
itself
to
be
the
equivalent
of
the
entire
people
considered
that
its
cause
was
the
cause
of
thus
the
attraction
was
real
and
powerful
the
voices
raised
to
protest
were
unable
to
make
themselves
heard
our
author
cites
on
this
subject
a
curious
instance
of
an
journal
friend
of
the
exclaimed
shall
say
whether
or
not
the
despotism
of
the
shall
not
succeed
the
pretended
aristocracy
of
the
nobility
it
is
this
indeed
which
has
come
to
pass
continues
lassalle
the
has
become
in
its
turn
the
privileged
class
the
proof
is
that
the
wealth
of
the
citizen
became
immediately
the
legal
condition
of
power
in
the
state
since
in
the
constitution
of
we
find
chap
sects
and
a
distinction
established
between
active
citizens
and
passive
citizens
the
former
are
those
who
pay
a
certain
quota
of
direct
contribution
and
they
alone
possess
the
right
of
voting
moreover
all
hired
laborers
were
declared
not
active
and
this
excluded
workmen
from
the
right
of
voting
it
matters
little
that
the
tax
was
small
the
principle
was
laid
down
requiring
some
amount
of
fortune
in
order
to
exercise
a
political
right
wealth
of
the
citizen
had
become
the
condition
necessary
for
obtaining
power
in
the
state
as
nobility
or
landed
property
had
been
in
the
middle
the
principle
of
the
held
sway
until
the
recent
introduction
of
universal
suffrage
our
socialist
proceeding
directly
to
the
question
of
taxes
proves
that
the
without
inventing
indirect
taxation
has
nevertheless
made
it
the
basis
of
an
entire
system
and
has
settled
upon
it
all
the
expenses
of
state
now
indirect
taxes
are
such
as
are
levied
beforehand
upon
all
necessaries
as
salt
corn
beer
meat
fuel
or
still
more
upon
what
we
need
for
our
protection
the
expenses
of
the
administration
of
justice
stamped
paper
etc
generally
in
making
a
purchase
the
buyer
pays
the
tax
without
perceiving
that
it
is
that
which
increases
the
price
now
it
is
clear
that
because
an
individual
is
twenty
fifty
or
a
hundred
times
richer
it
does
not
follow
that
he
will
on
that
account
consume
twenty
fifty
or
a
hundred
times
more
salt
bread
meat
than
a
workman
or
a
person
of
humble
condition
thus
it
happens
that
the
great
body
of
indirect
taxes
is
paid
by
the
poorest
classes
from
the
single
fact
that
they
are
the
most
numerous
thus
is
it
brought
about
in
a
hidden
way
that
the
pay
relatively
less
taxes
than
the
concerning
the
instruction
of
adults
lassalle
says
that
instead
of
being
left
to
the
clergy
as
heretofore
it
now
in
fact
belongs
to
the
daily
press
but
securities
stamps
and
advertisements
give
to
journalism
another
privilege
of
capital
this
sketch
suffices
and
i
deem
it
needless
to
add
that
i
am
far
from
concluding
with
the
socialists
i
am
so
much
the
more
free
to
disagree
with
them
as
i
do
not
by
any
means
admit
the
principles
but
it
seems
to
me
to
follow
evidently
from
the
preceding
observations
that
it
is
not
true
in
fact
that
the
general
will
has
made
the
laws
since
does
universal
suffrage
express
the
general
will
has
the
introduction
of
universal
suffrage
modified
in
any
great
degree
this
state
of
things
is
it
any
more
certain
since
than
before
that
the
nation
is
governed
by
the
general
will
we
may
content
ourselves
here
by
appealing
to
the
testimony
of
honest
men
if
the
general
will
were
truly
the
master
of
all
the
powers
in
france
our
country
which
so
it
is
said
has
only
the
government
that
it
desires
would
be
a
model
of
union
and
concord
there
could
be
in
the
opposition
party
only
an
exceedingly
small
minority
otherwise
the
term
general
would
be
unjustifiable
and
we
would
follow
peacefully
the
ways
most
pleasing
to
us
this
would
not
be
saying
mark
it
well
that
those
ways
are
good
that
is
another
question
to
which
we
will
return
but
now
we
are
dealing
with
the
question
are
our
laws
formed
or
not
formed
by
the
general
will
according
to
the
formula
which
i
have
quoted
from
the
of
the
rights
of
notwithstanding
the
evidence
for
the
negative
i
think
it
well
here
to
analyze
hastily
that
which
taine
has
just
given
in
a
little
pamphlet
containing
many
truths
taine
being
a
and
a
man
of
the
times
can
not
be
suspected
of
taking
an
ultramontane
or
clerical
view
of
the
case
taine
is
far
from
demanding
the
abolition
of
universal
suffrage
he
believes
it
in
conformity
with
justice
for
he
does
not
admit
that
his
money
can
be
demanded
or
he
himself
sent
to
the
frontier
without
his
own
consent
either
expressed
or
tacit
his
only
wish
is
that
the
right
of
suffrage
be
not
illusory
and
that
the
electoral
law
be
adapted
the
french
of
to
the
peasant
the
workman
be
he
ignorant
or
from
this
taine
proves
at
the
outset
that
the
is
a
humbug
and
i
believe
that
no
person
of
sense
will
contest
the
point
he
immediately
enters
upon
a
statistical
examination
of
the
composition
of
the
elective
world
in
france
and
he
arrives
at
the
following
result
twenty
voters
ten
are
peasants
four
workmen
three
three
educated
men
comfortable
or
rich
now
the
electoral
law
as
all
law
should
have
regard
to
the
majority
to
the
first
it
behooves
us
then
to
know
who
these
fourteen
are
who
are
called
to
frame
the
law
that
is
to
say
to
decide
by
their
representatives
it
is
true
but
sovereignly
on
good
and
evil
justice
and
injustice
and
necessarily
the
fate
of
the
country
taine
in
this
connection
makes
some
new
calculations
which
may
be
thus
summed
up
the
rural
population
embraces
seventy
out
of
one
hundred
of
the
entire
population
hence
fourteen
voters
out
of
twenty
now
in
france
there
are
illiterate
out
of
every
hundred
males
almost
all
belonging
to
the
classes
which
taine
numbers
among
the
rural
population
which
enables
him
to
find
that
seven
out
of
every
fourteen
rural
voters
can
not
even
read
i
may
observe
in
passing
that
a
peasant
who
can
not
read
but
who
knows
his
catechism
may
be
of
a
much
sounder
morality
than
taine
himself
but
i
willingly
proclaim
that
the
seven
electors
in
question
could
and
should
have
a
mediocre
political
intelligence
this
agreeable
writer
recounts
in
a
spicy
way
a
number
of
anecdotes
which
prove
ignorance
and
of
the
rural
populations
on
similar
matters
and
he
thence
concludes
that
the
peasants
still
subjects
but
under
a
nameless
this
is
precisely
what
i
said
at
the
beginning
not
only
of
peasants
but
of
all
modern
people
in
general
be
there
a
king
on
the
throne
or
not
somebody
decrees
this
somebody
decrees
that
and
the
subject
depends
in
a
hundred
ways
on
this
abstract
and
undetermined
somebody
the
collector
through
the
mayor
through
the
of
forests
through
the
commissary
of
police
through
the
through
the
clerks
of
justice
for
making
a
door
for
felling
a
tree
building
a
shed
opening
a
stall
transporting
a
cask
of
wine
all
this
expresses
well
and
depicts
admirably
the
ways
of
modern
liberty
and
i
can
not
refrain
from
citing
this
last
sketch
equally
amusing
and
true
mayor
knows
that
in
town
in
an
elegant
apartment
is
a
worthy
gentleman
attired
in
broidered
gown
who
receives
him
two
or
three
times
a
year
speaks
to
him
with
authority
and
condescension
and
often
puts
to
him
embarrassing
questions
but
when
this
gentleman
goes
away
another
takes
his
place
quite
similar
and
in
the
same
garb
and
the
mayor
on
his
return
home
says
with
satisfaction
the
prefect
always
preserves
his
good
will
towards
me
although
he
has
been
changed
many
the
the
appeal
to
the
people
the
invitation
to
vote
on
the
form
of
government
addressed
to
this
kind
of
electors
is
it
not
all
a
cunning
trick
taine
thinks
so
and
many
others
with
him
but
he
supposes
that
this
same
elector
will
be
at
least
capable
of
the
particular
man
in
whom
he
has
most
it
is
with
him
says
he
in
the
choice
of
one
who
shall
make
the
laws
as
in
the
choice
of
the
physician
or
the
lawyer
whom
one
may
prefer
although
it
is
not
my
intention
to
discuss
here
the
opinions
of
this
author
i
beg
him
to
remark
that
his
comparison
is
strikingly
faulty
we
can
not
choose
whom
we
please
for
our
physician
or
for
our
lawyer
the
former
is
obliged
to
go
through
a
course
of
studies
in
order
to
merit
his
diploma
the
latter
must
fulfil
the
conditions
necessary
to
be
admitted
to
the
bar
to
frame
the
laws
is
another
thing
not
the
slightest
preparation
is
exacted
from
those
eligible
to
this
duty
apparently
it
is
not
considered
worth
the
trouble
the
and
being
disposed
of
taine
returns
to
figures
to
study
what
transpires
when
the
electors
are
called
upon
to
choose
a
deputy
by
district
this
gives
says
he
one
deputy
for
twenty
thousand
voters
spread
over
a
surface
of
one
thousand
kilometres
square
etc
of
the
twenty
thousand
voters
how
many
will
have
a
definite
opinion
of
the
candidate
presented
to
them
scarcely
one
in
ten
beyond
the
outskirts
of
the
town
scarcely
one
in
four
or
five
in
the
whole
district
there
remains
the
resource
of
advice
but
spirit
of
equality
is
and
the
hierarchy
is
we
touch
here
the
most
sorrowful
wound
of
our
social
state
and
this
term
even
is
it
not
misapplied
for
we
have
no
longer
any
order
or
by
consequence
any
social
state
a
general
rule
continues
taine
country
people
receive
counsel
only
from
their
therefore
it
is
easy
to
employ
evil
means
these
evil
means
may
be
summed
up
according
to
the
same
author
in
the
abuse
of
governmental
influence
and
in
a
corruption
whose
form
varies
but
which
makes
the
affair
of
an
election
an
affair
of
money
there
should
be
and
i
have
alluded
to
it
in
passing
many
exceptions
made
with
regard
to
what
taine
says
concerning
the
rural
population
he
believes
them
manifestly
less
able
to
vote
than
the
city
populations
while
i
am
of
quite
the
contrary
opinion
but
it
still
remains
true
that
direct
universal
suffrage
such
as
we
have
does
not
allow
a
person
to
choose
from
a
knowledge
of
the
case
and
that
in
reality
the
general
will
has
not
up
to
the
present
day
been
able
to
find
its
true
expression
this
is
all
that
i
need
prove
for
the
present
is
the
general
will
competent
to
make
laws
this
is
a
still
higher
question
and
one
which
we
must
now
approach
admitting
that
the
general
will
could
make
itself
known
is
it
an
authority
competent
to
make
laws
but
before
starting
let
us
lay
down
a
first
principle
which
quite
elementary
as
it
is
seems
to
be
as
much
forgotten
as
the
others
if
the
natural
law
exist
not
anteriorly
to
enjoin
respect
for
human
laws
human
power
would
have
no
other
ground
of
existence
no
other
support
than
force
without
a
divine
lawgiver
there
is
in
truth
no
moral
obligation
the
hypothesis
of
a
previous
agreement
among
the
members
of
society
would
not
resolve
the
difficulty
for
an
agreement
would
not
be
able
to
bind
any
one
at
least
if
there
were
no
higher
authority
to
secure
it
whatever
may
be
the
immediate
origin
of
law
be
it
promulgated
by
a
sovereign
enacted
by
an
assembly
or
directly
willed
by
the
multitude
it
would
still
be
unable
to
rule
if
we
do
not
suppose
a
law
anterior
and
as
cicero
says
eternal
which
in
the
first
place
prescribes
obedience
to
subjects
and
in
the
second
fidelity
to
reciprocal
engagements
promises
and
oaths
this
superior
law
being
the
natural
law
it
is
always
and
in
every
case
impossible
to
suppress
or
to
elude
it
meanwhile
what
is
understood
by
the
general
will
is
it
the
unanimity
of
wills
no
one
so
far
as
i
know
has
ever
exacted
this
condition
the
question
is
then
taking
things
at
their
best
of
the
will
of
the
majority
people
grant
this
and
often
give
to
our
modern
governments
the
name
of
governments
of
the
majority
they
deduce
then
from
this
principle
that
in
a
population
of
thirty
millions
of
men
for
example
it
is
lawful
that
the
will
of
the
twenty
millions
should
rule
over
that
of
the
remaining
ten
millions
if
the
constitution
of
a
kingdom
says
burke
is
an
arithmetical
problem
the
calculation
is
just
but
if
the
minority
refuse
to
submit
the
majority
will
be
able
to
govern
only
by
the
aid
of
scaffolds
shootings
exile
prison
such
are
in
truth
the
institutions
which
have
chiefly
flourished
since
the
famous
of
the
rights
of
in
the
eyes
of
a
man
who
knows
how
to
reason
continues
the
english
orator
this
opinion
is
ridiculous
it
could
not
be
justified
unless
it
were
well
proved
that
the
majority
of
men
are
enlightened
virtuous
wise
and
incapable
of
preferring
their
own
interest
to
that
of
others
no
one
has
ever
dared
to
say
that
legislators
should
make
laws
for
the
sake
of
making
them
and
without
troubling
themselves
concerning
the
welfare
of
those
for
whom
the
laws
are
made
now
the
laws
being
made
for
all
the
majority
if
it
had
the
qualities
necessary
for
legislating
should
concern
itself
still
more
about
the
minority
than
about
itself
the
comte
de
la
marck
relates
that
when
mirabeau
became
too
much
excited
concerning
the
rights
and
privileges
of
man
it
happened
sometimes
that
he
amused
himself
by
curtailing
his
accounts
he
cut
off
first
women
children
the
ignorant
the
vicious
etc
once
the
nation
being
thus
reduced
to
the
little
portion
whose
moral
qualities
it
became
necessary
to
estimate
began
says
he
deduct
those
who
lack
reason
those
who
have
false
notions
those
who
value
their
own
interests
above
everything
those
who
lack
education
and
knowledge
matured
by
reflection
and
i
then
asked
him
if
the
men
who
merit
to
be
spoken
of
with
dignity
and
respect
would
not
find
themselves
reduced
to
a
number
infinitely
small
now
according
to
my
principle
i
maintained
that
the
government
should
act
the
people
and
not
them
that
is
to
say
not
by
the
opinion
of
the
multitude
and
i
proved
by
historical
extracts
and
by
examples
which
we
had
unfortunately
under
our
eyes
that
reason
and
good
sense
fly
from
men
in
proportion
as
they
are
gathered
together
in
greater
mirabeau
contented
himself
with
replying
that
one
must
flatter
the
people
in
order
to
govern
them
which
amounts
to
saying
that
one
must
cheat
them
for
the
rest
this
same
mirabeau
acknowledged
that
equality
in
the
revolutionary
sense
is
absurd
and
the
passion
which
some
have
for
it
he
called
a
violent
paroxysm
it
is
he
who
best
characterized
the
true
result
of
the
destruction
of
all
social
order
he
called
it
he
could
not
have
spoken
better
and
the
vanity
which
goes
so
low
could
have
no
other
result
than
that
which
we
behold
the
premeditated
absence
or
suppression
of
all
true
superiority
this
episode
on
equality
is
not
a
digression
for
the
system
of
majorities
supposes
it
now
it
is
absolutely
according
to
the
beautiful
idea
of
aristotle
there
is
in
man
himself
a
soul
and
a
body
the
one
predominating
and
made
to
command
the
other
to
obey
the
equality
or
the
shifting
of
power
between
these
two
elements
would
be
equally
fatal
to
them
it
is
the
same
between
man
and
the
other
animals
between
tame
animals
and
wild
the
harmony
of
sex
is
analogous
and
we
even
find
some
traces
of
this
principle
in
inanimate
objects
as
for
example
in
the
harmony
of
sounds
therefore
augustine
defines
order
thus
a
disposition
of
things
similar
and
dissimilar
as
shall
give
to
each
what
is
proper
to
est
parium
dispariumque
rerum
sua
cuique
tribuens
and
thomas
hence
concludes
that
order
supposes
inequality
ordinis
inæqualitatem
but
the
have
changed
all
that
according
to
sganarelle
so
their
work
in
its
final
analysis
results
in
a
disorder
without
name
the
external
disorder
is
visible
and
pretty
generally
acknowledged
but
the
moral
disorder
passes
unperceived
by
means
of
equality
on
the
one
hand
and
of
the
secularization
of
the
law
on
the
other
they
arrive
at
this
frightful
result
for
example
that
regicide
and
parricide
are
in
justice
but
ordinary
crimes
if
moreover
regicide
profits
the
people
it
is
worthy
of
eulogy
sacrilege
is
nothing
more
than
a
superstitious
fiction
in
fine
being
no
longer
possible
nor
even
reasonable
according
to
the
prediction
of
burke
laws
have
no
other
guardian
than
terror
and
in
perspective
from
our
point
of
view
we
see
but
scaffolds
or
which
amount
to
the
same
thing
consequences
of
the
secularization
of
law
how
often
do
we
not
hear
it
said
that
almost
all
our
misfortunes
and
above
all
our
inability
to
repair
our
losses
come
from
the
little
respect
we
have
for
the
law
this
statement
which
has
become
almost
trite
indicates
most
frequently
a
strange
wandering
after
having
destroyed
respect
for
persons
is
it
not
absurd
to
claim
it
for
their
works
but
they
have
done
more
they
have
denied
the
mission
of
a
legislator
the
secularization
of
the
law
that
is
to
say
the
denial
of
a
divine
sanction
applied
to
law
has
no
other
meaning
legislators
being
no
longer
the
mandataries
of
god
or
not
wishing
to
be
such
now
speak
only
in
virtue
of
their
own
lights
and
have
no
real
commission
by
what
title
then
would
you
have
us
respect
them
every
one
is
at
liberty
to
prefer
his
own
lights
and
to
believe
that
he
would
have
done
better
i
hear
the
reply
is
to
the
interest
of
all
that
order
should
reign
were
it
but
materially
and
the
law
is
the
principal
means
of
maintaining
you
may
hence
conclude
that
it
would
be
more
advantageous
to
see
the
laws
obeyed
but
a
motive
of
interest
is
not
a
motive
of
respect
and
there
is
a
certain
class
of
individuals
who
may
gain
by
the
disorder
no
you
will
have
the
right
to
claim
respect
for
the
law
only
when
you
shall
have
rendered
the
law
truly
respectable
and
to
do
this
you
must
prove
that
you
have
the
mission
to
make
the
law
even
were
you
the
of
our
statesmen
and
doctors
of
the
law
and
much
more
if
you
are
but
a
collection
of
the
most
uncultivated
in
the
world
knowledge
is
something
it
is
something
also
to
represent
real
and
considerable
interests
and
i
do
not
deny
the
relative
importance
of
the
elements
of
which
legislative
bodies
are
composed
but
nothing
of
all
this
can
supply
the
place
of
a
commission
and
you
will
have
that
only
when
you
shall
have
consented
as
legislators
to
acknowledge
the
existence
of
god
to
submit
yourselves
to
his
laws
and
to
conform
your
own
thereto
people
have
but
a
very
inadequate
idea
of
the
disastrous
consequences
which
one
day
or
other
may
ensue
from
the
secularization
of
law
until
now
the
only
danger
of
which
they
have
dreamed
is
that
with
which
extreme
revolution
menaces
us
this
is
a
danger
so
imminent
so
undisguised
that
every
one
sees
it
and
some
have
ended
by
understanding
that
without
a
return
to
god
society
is
destined
to
fall
nay
more
the
assembly
now
sitting
at
versailles
has
made
an
act
of
faith
by
ordering
public
prayers
and
this
first
step
has
caused
hope
to
revive
in
the
hearts
of
men
of
but
it
is
not
perhaps
inopportune
to
draw
the
attention
of
serious
men
to
another
phase
of
the
question
what
would
happen
if
modern
law
should
go
so
far
as
to
enjoin
a
crime
upon
christians
the
hypothesis
is
not
purely
imaginary
and
although
happily
thanks
to
heaven
it
has
not
yet
come
to
pass
there
is
a
whole
party
which
threatens
to
reach
this
extreme
in
other
countries
there
has
been
something
like
a
beginning
of
its
realization
i
would
like
to
speak
of
the
school
law
and
the
avowed
project
of
imposing
a
compulsory
and
lay
education
we
know
what
is
meant
by
in
such
a
case
and
experience
proves
that
the
state
schools
are
often
entrusted
to
men
whose
avowed
intention
is
to
bring
up
the
children
in
infidelity
what
would
happen
if
such
a
law
were
passed
which
supposes
that
everywhere
at
the
same
time
parents
would
be
compelled
to
put
their
children
in
imminent
danger
of
losing
their
faith
the
catholic
church
is
very
explicit
in
her
doctrine
on
the
obligation
of
obeying
even
a
bad
government
she
orders
that
useless
unjust
and
even
culpable
laws
be
borne
with
so
long
as
this
can
be
done
without
exposing
self
to
commit
a
sin
neither
plunder
nor
the
danger
of
death
excuses
revolt
in
her
eyes
but
in
this
case
do
we
understand
to
what
we
would
be
reduced
to
resist
passively
and
to
allow
self
to
be
punished
by
fines
by
prison
by
torture
or
by
death
would
not
remedy
the
evil
the
soul
of
the
child
remains
without
defence
and
the
father
is
responsible
for
it
this
kind
of
persecution
is
then
more
serious
in
its
consequences
and
may
lead
to
deeper
troubles
than
even
the
direct
persecution
which
might
consist
for
example
in
exacting
apostasy
from
adults
in
this
last
case
the
martyr
bears
all
and
the
first
christians
have
shown
us
the
way
but
here
the
torments
of
the
parents
can
not
save
the
children
and
the
parents
can
not
abandon
them
whatever
becomes
of
the
body
the
soul
must
be
guarded
until
death
it
belongs
not
to
me
to
decide
for
in
this
case
as
in
all
those
of
a
similar
kind
the
line
of
conduct
to
be
followed
ought
to
be
traced
by
the
only
competent
authority
but
the
problem
is
worth
proposing
and
by
it
alone
it
is
already
easy
to
throw
great
light
on
the
abysses
to
which
the
atheism
of
the
law
is
leading
the
people
by
rapid
strides
christian
definition
of
natural
law
it
remains
to
explain
in
a
few
words
the
great
principles
which
should
form
the
basis
of
law
and
which
were
never
completely
ignored
until
these
days
of
aberration
and
wretchedness
i
could
not
expect
to
give
here
in
these
few
pages
a
course
of
natural
law
nor
even
to
trace
its
outline
but
there
are
some
perfectly
incontestable
truths
which
it
is
very
necessary
to
recall
since
people
have
forgotten
them
when
one
has
no
personal
authority
he
feels
a
certain
timidity
in
broaching
so
grave
a
subject
and
in
speaking
of
it
as
if
he
aspired
to
enlighten
his
kind
and
meanwhile
error
is
insinuated
preached
disseminated
commanded
with
a
skill
so
infernal
and
a
success
so
great
that
ignorance
of
truth
is
almost
unbounded
of
such
elementary
rules
we
often
find
influential
persons
and
sometimes
persons
of
real
merit
totally
ignorant
in
other
days
they
would
have
known
them
on
leaving
school
or
even
from
their
catechism
let
us
go
back
then
to
the
definition
of
the
word
nature
and
it
will
serve
as
a
from
which
to
treat
of
what
the
laws
destined
to
govern
man
should
be
the
nature
of
a
being
is
that
which
renders
it
capable
of
attaining
its
end
this
is
true
of
a
plant
or
an
animal
as
well
as
of
man
but
there
are
two
kinds
of
ends
subordinate
one
to
the
other
the
end
for
which
god
created
the
world
could
be
no
other
than
god
himself
the
creator
could
only
propose
to
himself
an
end
worthy
of
himself
and
he
alone
being
perfect
he
could
not
find
outside
himself
an
end
proportioned
to
his
greatness
god
is
then
the
last
end
of
all
creatures
but
there
are
particular
ends
and
it
is
in
their
subordination
that
the
order
of
the
world
consists
the
primary
ends
are
in
a
certain
sense
but
a
means
for
arriving
at
the
last
end
but
god
being
unable
to
add
anything
to
his
infinite
perfection
the
end
which
he
proposed
to
himself
could
not
be
to
render
himself
more
perfect
hence
he
could
seek
only
an
exterior
glory
which
consists
in
manifesting
himself
to
his
creatures
for
this
it
was
necessary
that
some
of
these
creatures
should
be
capable
of
knowing
him
these
reasonable
creatures
are
superior
to
the
others
and
are
their
primary
end
therefore
it
is
that
theologians
call
man
a
microcosm
a
compendium
of
the
universe
and
king
of
the
world
man
is
placed
in
creation
to
admire
it
and
by
means
of
it
to
render
homage
to
god
for
in
his
quality
of
a
creature
gifted
with
reason
he
knows
his
end
which
is
god
and
the
essential
characteristic
of
his
nature
is
the
ability
to
attain
this
end
he
is
moreover
endowed
with
an
admirable
prerogative
liberty
or
that
is
to
say
he
is
called
on
to
will
this
end
and
god
in
his
infinite
bounty
will
recompense
him
for
having
willed
his
own
good
but
man
has
need
of
an
effort
to
will
good
for
his
primitive
nature
has
been
corrupted
by
the
original
fall
he
has
therefore
an
inclination
to
evil
against
which
he
must
incessantly
struggle
and
the
greatest
number
of
political
and
social
errors
have
their
source
in
ignorance
or
forgetfulness
of
this
perversion
of
human
nature
this
granted
the
natural
law
comprises
the
obligations
imposed
on
man
in
order
that
he
may
reach
his
end
together
with
the
prohibition
of
all
that
could
turn
him
away
from
it
this
law
obliges
all
men
even
those
who
have
no
knowledge
of
the
positive
divine
law
that
is
to
say
the
revealed
law
behold
how
gerson
has
defined
it
natural
law
is
a
sign
imprinted
upon
the
heart
of
every
man
enjoying
the
right
use
of
reason
and
which
makes
known
to
him
the
divine
will
in
virtue
of
which
the
human
creature
is
required
to
do
certain
things
and
to
avoid
certain
others
in
order
to
reach
his
among
the
precepts
which
god
has
engraved
upon
the
hearts
of
all
men
is
found
in
the
first
rank
that
which
obliges
them
to
refer
themselves
to
god
as
to
their
last
end
from
this
it
follows
that
every
law
which
tends
to
hinder
or
prevent
the
progress
of
men
toward
god
is
a
law
against
nature
and
consequently
null
injusta
non
est
for
no
human
law
can
change
or
abrogate
the
natural
law
continuation
the
end
of
society
according
to
the
natural
law
the
considerations
of
the
preceding
chapter
have
reference
to
man
considered
abstractly
from
society
but
man
can
not
exist
alone
for
life
and
subsistence
during
his
early
childhood
he
has
need
of
his
kind
so
that
from
the
first
moment
of
his
existence
he
forms
part
of
a
domestic
society
the
family
the
family
being
certainly
of
divine
institution
and
the
duties
which
it
imposes
being
of
the
number
of
those
which
the
natural
law
commands
we
find
therein
the
first
elements
of
all
society
authority
hierarchy
consequently
inequality
mutual
love
and
protection
in
a
word
varied
and
reciprocal
duties
but
the
family
suffices
not
for
social
cravings
man
naturally
longs
after
his
like
he
possesses
the
marvellous
gift
of
speech
for
communication
with
his
fellows
he
bears
engraven
on
his
heart
the
first
precept
of
his
duty
towards
them
unto
others
that
which
you
would
have
others
do
unto
you
and
do
not
unto
them
that
which
you
would
not
that
they
do
to
the
existence
of
society
is
therefore
still
a
law
of
nature
once
formed
society
itself
has
its
duties
it
has
its
proper
end
which
not
only
should
not
be
opposed
to
the
end
of
man
considered
singly
but
should
moreover
contribute
to
facilitate
the
attainment
of
that
end
the
end
of
man
being
god
and
this
end
being
attainable
only
by
virtue
the
principal
end
of
society
will
necessarily
be
to
aid
men
in
the
practice
of
virtue
and
that
i
may
not
be
accused
of
depending
exclusively
on
theology
i
will
adduce
what
aristotle
has
said
on
this
subject
most
perfect
state
is
evidently
that
in
which
each
citizen
whoever
he
may
be
may
by
favor
of
the
laws
best
practise
virtue
and
be
most
secure
of
and
what
is
happiness
according
to
aristotle
consider
it
a
point
perfectly
established
that
happiness
is
always
in
proportion
to
wisdom
for
the
soul
speaking
absolutely
and
even
relatively
to
us
is
more
precious
than
wealth
and
the
following
the
laws
of
nature
all
exterior
goods
are
desirable
only
insomuch
as
they
serve
the
soul
and
wise
men
should
not
desire
them
except
for
this
end
whereas
the
soul
should
never
be
placed
in
comparison
with
we
are
assuredly
far
off
from
this
pagan
and
he
goes
still
further
even
than
the
foregoing
for
he
lays
down
as
incontestable
a
principle
which
is
the
formal
condemnation
of
the
secularization
of
the
law
elements
of
happiness
says
he
the
same
for
the
individual
and
for
the
we
have
just
seen
what
he
understands
by
happiness
but
he
adds
in
order
that
he
may
be
the
better
comprehended
that
if
the
felicity
of
the
individual
consisted
in
wealth
it
would
be
the
same
for
the
city
according
to
aristotle
therefore
the
moral
law
obliges
society
as
it
does
the
individual
now
it
is
precisely
this
which
the
partisans
of
atheistical
or
merely
secular
law
deny
christian
law
i
have
designedly
quoted
the
ancient
philosophers
because
certain
diseased
minds
who
shrink
from
the
authority
of
the
sacred
books
accept
more
willingly
that
of
the
learned
but
i
believe
that
from
what
precedes
one
could
easily
infer
the
true
rule
of
the
relations
between
church
and
state
i
will
not
undertake
it
now
nevertheless
as
i
address
myself
by
preference
to
those
who
profess
the
same
faith
as
myself
i
will
take
the
liberty
to
point
out
to
them
some
inevitable
corollaries
of
the
principles
i
have
just
recalled
the
natural
law
properly
so
called
has
been
confirmed
and
completed
by
revelation
although
the
precepts
whose
observance
is
indispensable
to
man
to
reach
his
end
are
engraven
in
the
depths
of
his
heart
the
blindness
and
the
evil
propensities
which
are
the
consequences
of
his
fall
render
him
but
too
forgetful
of
his
duties
besides
god
having
resolved
to
save
man
chose
to
himself
a
privileged
people
that
from
it
he
might
cause
the
messias
to
be
born
and
for
the
accomplishment
of
his
merciful
designs
he
guided
this
people
and
made
it
the
guardian
of
his
law
even
to
the
day
on
which
the
promises
were
fulfilled
to
this
end
god
charged
moses
with
the
promulgation
of
a
positive
divine
law
which
contained
moral
precepts
precepts
relating
to
the
ceremonies
of
the
ancient
worship
and
political
precepts
that
is
to
say
precepts
relating
to
the
civil
government
of
the
jewish
people
the
last
two
classes
of
precepts
no
longer
oblige
but
those
which
concern
morals
that
is
to
say
those
of
the
decalogue
retain
all
their
force
because
they
are
the
precepts
of
the
natural
law
but
it
is
no
longer
by
virtue
of
the
promulgation
of
moses
that
we
are
bound
by
the
moral
obligations
contained
in
the
old
law
he
who
is
our
judge
our
legislator
our
king
has
come
himself
to
give
us
a
more
perfect
law
novum
do
joan
according
to
the
expression
of
suarez
jesus
christ
has
made
known
more
perfectly
the
natural
law
in
completing
it
by
new
precepts
jesus
christ
has
done
still
more
he
has
founded
a
new
kingdom
the
church
the
mystical
body
of
which
he
is
the
head
he
has
therefore
appointed
interpreters
and
guardians
of
his
law
who
have
the
mission
to
proclaim
it
to
those
who
know
it
not
to
pardon
in
his
name
those
who
having
violated
it
confess
and
repent
and
finally
to
distribute
the
numberless
succors
of
divine
grace
all
which
have
for
their
object
to
help
us
to
observe
the
law
as
perfectly
as
possible
and
consequently
to
enable
us
ourselves
to
approach
perfection
the
new
precepts
added
by
christ
to
those
of
the
natural
law
are
those
which
enjoin
upon
us
the
use
of
the
sacraments
and
which
determine
their
form
these
articles
of
the
new
law
if
we
may
be
allowed
so
to
term
them
are
all
as
obligatory
as
those
of
the
natural
law
because
they
have
god
himself
for
their
author
behold
how
thomas
sums
up
the
whole
of
the
new
law
or
the
law
of
grace
which
christ
came
to
bring
us
comprises
says
he
precepts
of
the
natural
law
the
articles
of
faith
and
the
sacraments
of
one
of
the
most
remarkable
characteristics
of
the
christian
law
is
that
it
was
not
written
jesus
christ
his
commandments
and
word
being
it
engraved
them
upon
the
hearts
of
his
apostles
and
disciples
but
the
incarnate
word
had
nothing
written
during
the
time
he
spent
upon
earth
the
first
gospel
appeared
at
least
eight
years
after
the
death
of
jesus
christ
if
to
this
observation
we
add
the
common
belief
of
theologians
according
to
which
it
was
only
from
the
coming
of
the
holy
ghost
that
is
to
say
from
the
day
of
pentecost
and
after
the
ascension
that
the
law
of
christ
became
obligatory
we
arrive
at
this
conclusion
that
the
means
of
oral
teaching
was
expressly
chosen
by
the
word
for
the
transmission
of
his
law
and
his
will
nothing
throws
greater
light
upon
the
sovereign
importance
of
the
church
and
its
hierarchy
nothing
manifests
better
the
extreme
necessity
of
a
permanent
infallibility
residing
somewhere
in
the
mystical
body
of
christ
the
council
of
the
vatican
conformably
to
the
tradition
of
all
christian
ages
has
that
roman
pontiff
enjoys
the
plenitude
of
that
infallibility
with
which
it
was
necessary
for
the
church
to
be
provided
in
defining
doctrine
touching
faith
or
these
last
words
show
that
the
pope
is
the
unfailing
interpreter
of
the
natural
law
and
the
judge
from
whom
there
is
no
appeal
of
its
violations
the
decisions
given
by
the
sovereign
pontiff
upon
human
laws
are
not
recognized
at
the
present
day
by
the
powers
of
the
earth
but
neither
is
god
recognized
and
thus
it
is
that
little
by
little
violence
has
overrun
the
world
and
law
has
vanished
europe
is
returning
to
a
worse
than
primitive
barbarism
and
catholics
are
no
longer
alone
in
saying
it
at
the
epoch
at
which
the
bishops
were
gathered
together
at
rome
for
the
last
council
a
publicist
of
great
merit
an
englishman
and
a
protestant
speaking
in
the
name
of
his
addressed
an
appeal
to
the
pope
entreating
him
to
labor
for
the
of
the
rights
of
the
people
the
rights
of
the
people
or
the
law
of
nature
said
urquhart
is
the
ten
commandments
applied
to
society
after
having
cited
lord
mansfield
who
says
that
this
right
considered
to
form
part
of
the
english
law
and
that
of
the
government
can
not
alter
it
urquhart
fears
not
to
add
it
is
against
their
governments
that
nations
should
protect
this
and
why
did
this
protestant
appeal
to
rome
because
in
sight
of
the
unjust
wars
which
ravage
europe
he
hoped
that
the
ecumenical
council
lay
down
a
rule
enabling
catholics
to
distinguish
the
just
from
the
unjust
so
that
the
pope
might
afterwards
exercise
juridical
power
over
communities
nations
and
their
the
rule
exists
for
the
natural
or
divine
law
engraven
by
god
from
the
beginning
upon
the
hearts
of
all
men
and
more
expressly
revealed
in
the
decalogue
was
the
subject
of
the
teaching
of
christ
the
juridical
power
and
the
tribunal
from
which
there
is
no
appeal
equally
exist
but
the
voice
of
the
judge
is
no
longer
listened
to
by
those
who
govern
human
society
but
it
is
not
this
which
is
important
and
urquhart
is
right
it
is
the
nations
which
should
invoke
against
their
new
tyrants
the
only
efficacious
protection
it
is
the
people
who
should
first
bend
before
the
beneficent
authority
of
the
infallible
master
of
the
moral
law
there
would
then
be
no
further
need
of
the
consent
of
governments
conclusion
i
said
in
beginning
the
last
paragraph
that
it
was
addressed
to
catholics
by
right
of
corollary
from
the
preceding
considerations
it
is
certain
indeed
that
if
all
catholics
were
truly
instructed
and
well
convinced
of
the
truths
that
i
have
endeavored
to
set
forth
as
briefly
and
clearly
as
i
could
a
great
step
in
the
right
path
would
already
have
been
taken
but
there
is
a
and
very
convenient
objection
which
many
excellent
men
fail
not
to
proffer
in
such
a
case
is
true
say
they
if
human
discussions
and
quarrels
could
be
referred
to
the
highest
moral
authority
on
earth
it
would
afford
great
advantages
but
this
is
not
times
have
changed
and
it
is
impossible
to
hope
that
this
authority
can
ever
recover
the
influence
it
would
require
in
order
to
act
if
good
men
adhere
to
the
fatal
habit
they
have
acquired
of
renouncing
beforehand
all
effort
for
fear
it
will
not
be
successful
nothing
can
be
done
and
there
remains
to
us
nothing
but
to
veil
our
faces
while
awaiting
the
destruction
of
our
country
and
of
all
organized
society
but
even
were
we
reduced
to
despair
we
never
have
the
right
of
renouncing
our
convictions
nor
of
ceasing
to
act
personally
according
to
the
prescriptions
of
our
faith
before
concerning
ourselves
about
the
doings
of
others
and
without
needing
to
count
on
success
we
must
begin
by
conforming
ourselves
to
the
teachings
of
truth
which
is
by
its
nature
unchangeable
for
there
is
no
progress
or
civilization
which
can
alter
one
iota
of
the
divine
laws
moreover
he
is
very
bold
who
would
dare
to
predict
what
europe
will
or
will
not
be
several
years
hence
either
it
is
condemned
and
then
for
his
own
peace
of
mind
a
man
should
allow
himself
to
be
guided
by
his
conscience
with
the
full
certainty
of
not
doing
wrong
or
god
wills
to
save
europe
still
another
time
and
this
can
never
be
save
by
truth
with
regard
to
practical
means
of
which
they
make
so
much
at
the
present
day
i
see
no
one
who
proposes
them
inspiring
any
confidence
every
one
hesitates
gropes
and
most
often
acknowledges
that
he
can
only
invent
the
present
hour
is
favorable
to
good
in
this
sense
that
the
greater
number
of
errors
no
longer
exercise
the
same
seduction
as
at
the
beginning
of
the
century
evil
presses
us
on
all
sides
and
according
to
the
expression
of
one
of
our
most
distinguished
publicists
has
after
there
is
no
middle
way
between
social
war
and
the
return
to
good
we
meet
at
every
step
upright
minds
who
break
their
idols
there
are
too
many
who
know
not
yet
with
what
to
replace
them
but
it
is
still
much
to
have
seen
error
furthermore
there
are
untiring
seekers
some
of
whom
have
found
the
whole
truth
and
others
who
find
but
the
fragments
all
help
to
prepare
the
way
for
the
reconstruction
of
the
social
edifice
he
to
whom
i
have
dedicated
this
work
will
pardon
me
i
hope
if
i
quote
from
him
i
do
not
believe
that
there
is
another
example
of
an
equal
influence
so
rapidly
exercised
by
a
book
so
serious
so
grave
in
matter
so
little
attractive
to
the
frivolous
reader
as
that
which
he
has
written
upon
to
rediscover
social
truth
by
the
method
of
observation
and
analysis
was
already
a
phenomenon
which
i
consider
unique
of
its
kind
to
cause
it
to
be
adopted
by
so
great
a
number
of
minds
biassed
and
filled
with
hostile
prejudices
and
most
frequently
badly
prepared
by
their
previous
studies
is
a
fact
still
more
astonishing
thus
as
i
said
in
my
dedicatory
epistle
it
is
impossible
for
me
not
to
see
herein
one
of
the
most
consoling
signs
of
our
age
the
scientific
processes
of
le
play
were
perhaps
the
only
ones
which
would
find
favor
with
a
generation
so
dialectical
and
so
enamored
with
the
exact
sciences
as
ours
notwithstanding
the
sorrows
which
oppress
us
we
must
not
despair
and
above
all
we
must
not
trouble
ourselves
too
much
concerning
the
errors
of
what
people
agree
to
call
public
opinion
the
errors
regarding
the
general
will
reproduce
themselves
under
another
form
in
the
uneasiness
which
this
queen
of
the
world
instils
into
the
minds
of
men
of
if
we
consider
closely
what
the
elements
of
opinion
are
we
very
quickly
perceive
that
in
general
it
merits
the
name
of
public
only
because
it
proclaims
itself
very
loudly
and
makes
itself
known
in
all
the
public
squares
in
reality
a
party
much
less
considerable
than
we
suppose
announces
to
the
world
and
imagines
most
frequently
in
good
faith
that
it
alone
is
enlightened
its
boldness
inspires
awe
and
by
degrees
those
who
compose
it
succeed
in
persuading
the
multitude
and
in
persuading
themselves
that
they
represent
the
only
worthy
of
note
and
who
are
these
financiers
and
journalists
who
carry
on
business
in
common
lawyers
professors
much
tainted
themselves
officers
occupying
a
position
and
others
wishing
to
obtain
one
from
them
the
idle
men
and
women
is
it
then
true
that
these
represent
the
nation
eager
for
their
own
interest
or
for
that
of
others
these
pretended
echoes
of
public
opinion
are
wont
to
say
people
believe
the
people
wish
the
people
will
never
consent
it
does
not
suit
the
people
etc
what
a
pity
the
people
are
nothing
in
revolutions
in
which
they
are
but
passive
instruments
france
no
longer
ardently
desires
anything
except
repose
at
first
sight
this
proposition
would
seem
true
the
previous
consent
of
the
french
is
necessary
for
the
of
the
monarchy
nothing
is
more
false
the
multitude
never
obtains
what
it
wills
it
always
accepts
it
never
chooses
we
may
even
notice
an
of
providence
if
i
may
be
allowed
the
expression
inasmuch
as
the
efforts
of
the
people
to
attain
an
object
are
the
very
means
which
it
makes
use
of
to
withdraw
them
from
it
the
french
revolution
the
people
were
constantly
chained
outraged
ruined
torn
by
factions
and
the
factions
in
their
turn
the
sport
of
one
another
constantly
drifted
notwithstanding
all
their
efforts
only
to
be
dashed
against
the
rock
which
awaited
in
the
establishment
and
the
overthrow
of
sovereignties
the
mass
of
the
people
enter
only
as
the
wood
and
the
cord
employed
by
a
machinist
their
chiefs
even
are
such
only
to
strangers
in
reality
they
are
led
as
they
lead
the
people
when
the
proper
moment
shall
arrive
the
supreme
ruler
of
empires
will
chase
away
these
noisy
insects
then
we
shall
be
astonished
at
the
profound
nothingness
of
these
men
people
imagine
that
the
political
world
goes
on
by
chance
and
that
it
is
not
organized
directed
animated
by
the
same
wisdom
which
shines
in
the
physical
world
great
malefactors
who
overthrow
the
state
necessarily
produce
melancholy
internal
dismemberments
but
when
man
labors
to
order
he
associates
himself
with
the
author
of
order
he
is
favored
by
nature
that
is
to
say
by
the
aggregate
of
secondary
causes
which
are
the
instruments
of
the
divinity
his
action
has
something
divine
it
is
at
once
gentle
and
powerful
it
forces
nothing
and
nothing
resists
these
beautiful
words
are
as
true
as
in
duration
ii
all
change
implies
succession
hence
the
duration
of
contingent
beings
inasmuch
as
they
are
subject
to
actual
change
involves
succession
the
duration
of
the
changes
brought
about
by
purely
spiritual
operations
transcends
our
experience
for
we
are
not
pure
spirits
hence
we
have
no
means
of
measuring
such
changes
by
their
intrinsic
measure
but
the
duration
of
the
changes
which
occur
in
the
material
world
through
local
movements
lies
within
the
range
of
our
apprehensive
faculty
and
can
be
measured
by
us
for
we
find
in
nature
many
movements
which
by
their
constant
recurrence
and
their
uniformity
are
calculated
to
serve
as
terms
of
comparison
for
measuring
the
length
of
successive
duration
of
the
duration
of
local
movement
which
we
measure
by
a
given
standard
is
called
and
therefore
time
may
be
properly
and
adequately
defined
as
the
duration
of
local
movement
from
this
definition
it
immediately
follows
that
where
there
is
no
movement
there
can
be
no
time
accordingly
there
was
no
time
before
creation
as
there
was
no
movement
it
follows
also
that
the
duration
of
created
things
inasmuch
as
it
expresses
the
permanence
of
those
things
in
their
own
being
is
not
time
for
it
is
of
the
essence
of
time
to
be
successive
and
there
is
no
succession
where
there
is
no
change
and
no
change
without
movement
hence
when
we
say
that
contingent
beings
exist
in
time
we
do
not
refer
to
their
essence
or
substance
as
such
but
to
their
successive
modes
of
being
by
which
their
duration
acquires
its
accidental
successivity
were
the
whole
world
reduced
to
perfect
stillness
by
impeding
or
suspending
the
actions
and
movements
of
all
creatures
time
would
at
the
same
instant
cease
to
flow
for
time
is
not
the
duration
of
things
but
the
duration
of
movement
time
may
be
considered
either
as
a
or
as
a
in
fact
intervals
of
successive
duration
are
like
distances
real
relations
but
when
we
think
of
the
greater
or
less
extent
of
space
which
can
be
measured
with
a
given
velocity
between
two
correlated
terms
of
time
these
same
intervals
exhibit
themselves
under
the
form
of
continuous
quantities
time
as
a
relation
is
defined
by
thomas
and
by
all
the
ancients
as
prioris
et
posterioris
that
is
as
the
link
between
the
and
the
of
any
movement
and
as
a
quantity
it
is
defined
as
that
is
as
a
number
arising
from
the
mensuration
of
the
movement
this
movement
is
always
local
as
we
have
already
intimated
for
we
can
not
measure
successive
duration
by
any
other
kind
of
movement
hence
it
is
that
the
duration
which
is
predicated
of
spiritual
substances
and
of
their
operations
differs
in
kind
from
our
time
for
since
such
substances
are
not
subjected
to
local
movements
their
duration
can
not
be
measured
in
terms
of
space
and
velocity
as
our
time
but
only
in
terms
of
intellectual
movements
which
have
nothing
common
with
the
periodical
revolutions
from
which
we
desume
the
measure
of
our
days
years
and
centuries
when
we
say
that
angels
have
existed
for
centuries
we
measure
the
duration
of
their
existence
by
a
measure
which
is
altogether
extrinsic
to
them
and
in
the
same
manner
we
measure
the
duration
of
our
own
intellectual
operations
by
a
measure
extrinsic
to
them
that
is
by
comparing
it
with
the
duration
of
some
movement
occurring
in
our
bodies
or
in
the
surrounding
world
since
time
is
the
duration
of
movement
it
is
plain
that
when
we
perceive
movement
we
immediately
perceive
time
and
since
movement
implies
a
continuous
change
it
is
plain
also
that
the
greater
the
number
of
changes
we
can
distinctly
perceive
in
a
given
succession
the
better
we
realize
the
flowing
of
time
it
is
for
this
reason
that
time
seems
longer
in
sickness
or
in
a
sleepless
night
than
in
good
health
and
in
a
pleasurable
occupation
for
gladness
and
amusement
distract
our
minds
and
do
not
allow
us
to
reflect
enough
on
what
is
going
on
around
us
whilst
anything
which
affects
us
painfully
calls
our
attention
to
ourselves
and
to
our
sensations
and
thus
causes
us
to
reflect
on
a
great
number
of
movements
to
which
in
other
circumstances
we
would
pay
no
attention
at
all
it
is
for
this
reason
also
that
when
we
are
fast
asleep
we
have
no
perception
of
the
flowing
of
time
the
moment
one
falls
asleep
he
ceases
to
perceive
the
succession
of
changes
both
interior
and
exterior
from
the
consideration
of
which
time
should
be
estimated
hence
when
he
awakes
he
instinctively
unites
the
present
with
that
in
which
he
fell
asleep
as
if
there
had
been
no
intermediate
time
thus
in
the
same
manner
as
there
is
no
time
without
movement
there
is
no
actual
perception
of
time
without
the
actual
perception
of
movement
of
we
have
said
that
time
as
a
quantity
is
measured
by
movement
the
sense
of
this
proposition
is
that
a
body
moving
with
uniform
velocity
describes
spaces
proportional
to
the
times
employed
and
therefore
if
we
assume
as
a
unit
of
measure
the
time
employed
in
describing
a
certain
unit
of
space
with
a
given
velocity
the
duration
of
the
movement
will
contain
as
many
units
of
time
as
there
are
units
of
space
measured
by
that
velocity
thus
if
the
revolution
of
the
earth
around
its
axis
is
taken
as
the
unit
of
movement
and
its
duration
or
the
day
as
the
unit
of
time
the
number
of
days
will
increase
at
the
same
rate
as
the
number
of
revolutions
speaking
in
general
if
the
time
employed
in
describing
uniformly
a
space
be
taken
as
a
unit
of
time
and
be
the
time
employed
in
describing
uniformly
a
space
with
the
same
constant
velocity
we
have
the
proportion
the
unit
of
time
is
necessarily
arbitrary
or
conventional
for
there
is
no
natural
unit
of
measure
in
continuous
quantities
whose
divisibility
has
no
end
as
we
have
explained
in
a
preceding
article
the
space
uniformly
described
in
the
unit
of
time
represents
the
velocity
of
the
movement
and
therefore
the
duration
of
the
movement
comprises
as
many
units
of
time
as
there
are
units
in
the
ratio
of
the
space
to
the
constant
velocity
with
which
it
is
measured
in
other
terms
time
is
the
ratio
of
the
space
described
to
the
velocity
with
which
it
is
described
we
often
hear
it
said
that
as
time
is
measured
by
movement
so
also
movement
is
measured
by
time
but
this
needs
explanation
when
we
say
that
time
is
measured
by
movement
we
mean
that
time
is
represented
by
the
ratio
of
the
space
to
the
velocity
with
which
it
is
described
or
by
the
ratio
of
the
material
extension
to
the
formal
extending
of
the
movement
for
the
proportion
above
deduced
gives
where
represents
the
length
of
the
movement
in
space
which
length
is
its
material
constituent
and
represents
its
intensity
which
is
its
formal
constituent
on
the
other
hand
when
we
say
that
movement
is
measured
by
time
we
either
mean
that
the
ratio
of
the
space
to
the
velocity
is
represented
by
the
time
employed
in
the
movement
and
thus
we
merely
interchange
the
members
of
our
equation
by
which
no
new
conclusion
can
be
reached
or
we
mean
that
the
length
and
the
velocity
of
the
movement
are
measured
by
time
but
this
can
not
be
for
our
equation
gives
for
the
length
of
the
movement
and
this
shows
that
time
alone
can
not
measure
the
length
of
the
space
described
on
the
other
hand
the
same
equation
gives
for
the
velocity
and
this
shows
that
time
is
not
the
measure
of
velocity
as
the
one
diminishes
when
the
other
increases
this
suffices
to
show
that
the
phrase
is
measured
by
must
be
interpreted
in
a
very
limited
sense
as
simply
meaning
that
between
movement
and
time
there
is
a
necessary
connection
and
that
all
other
things
remaining
equal
the
length
of
the
movement
is
proportional
to
the
length
of
the
time
employed
yet
this
does
not
mean
that
the
length
of
the
movement
depends
entirely
on
the
time
employed
for
the
same
length
may
be
described
in
different
times
but
it
means
that
the
time
employed
depends
on
the
material
and
formal
extent
of
the
movement
as
above
explained
for
according
as
we
take
different
velocities
different
lengths
will
be
described
in
equal
time
and
equal
lengths
in
different
times
it
is
not
the
time
that
extends
the
movement
but
it
is
the
movement
that
by
its
extension
extends
its
own
time
the
true
measure
of
movement
is
its
velocity
for
the
measure
of
any
given
quantity
is
a
unit
of
the
same
kind
and
velocity
is
the
unit
of
movement
time
as
measured
by
us
is
a
number
which
arises
from
the
mensuration
of
the
movement
by
its
velocity
and
therefore
time
results
from
the
movement
as
already
measured
this
shows
again
that
time
is
not
the
measure
of
the
of
the
movement
we
have
seen
also
that
time
is
not
the
measure
of
the
of
the
movement
it
follows
therefore
that
the
quantity
of
movement
is
not
measured
by
time
time
being
the
ratio
of
two
quantities
mathematically
homogeneous
is
represented
by
an
number
yet
the
same
time
may
be
expressed
by
different
numbers
according
as
we
measure
it
by
different
units
as
days
hours
minutes
etc
these
numbers
however
are
only
virtually
discrete
as
time
can
not
be
discontinued
balmes
from
the
equation
deduces
the
consequence
that
velocity
is
essentially
a
relation
for
it
can
not
be
otherwise
expressed
than
by
the
ratio
of
the
space
to
the
we
think
that
this
conclusion
is
faulty
space
and
time
are
not
homogeneous
quantities
hence
the
mathematical
ratio
of
space
to
time
is
not
an
abstract
but
a
concrete
number
and
therefore
it
represents
an
absolute
quantity
space
divided
by
time
is
a
length
divided
into
equal
parts
hence
the
quotient
the
velocity
represents
the
length
of
the
movement
made
in
the
unit
of
time
and
since
balmes
admits
that
the
length
of
the
movement
is
a
quantity
having
a
determinate
value
we
do
not
see
how
he
can
escape
the
consequence
that
velocity
too
is
a
quantity
of
the
same
kind
and
not
a
mere
relation
the
expression
of
velocity
says
balmes
terms
enter
space
and
time
viewing
the
former
in
the
real
order
abstraction
made
of
that
of
phenomena
we
more
easily
come
to
regard
it
as
something
fixed
and
we
comprehend
it
in
a
given
case
without
any
relation
a
foot
is
at
all
times
a
foot
and
a
yard
a
yard
these
are
quantities
existing
in
reality
and
if
we
refer
them
to
other
quantities
it
is
only
to
make
sure
that
they
are
so
not
because
their
reality
depends
upon
the
relation
a
cubic
foot
of
water
is
not
a
cubic
foot
because
the
measure
so
says
but
on
the
contrary
the
measure
so
says
because
there
is
a
cubic
foot
the
measure
itself
is
also
an
absolute
quantity
and
in
general
all
extensions
are
absolute
for
otherwise
we
should
be
obliged
to
seek
measure
of
measure
and
so
on
to
loc
cit
this
passage
shows
that
a
length
described
in
space
is
according
to
balmes
an
absolute
quantity
and
since
the
mathematical
value
of
velocity
represents
a
length
described
in
space
as
we
have
just
proved
it
follows
that
velocity
has
an
absolute
value
but
leaving
aside
all
mathematical
considerations
we
may
show
that
velocity
has
an
absolute
value
by
reference
to
metaphysical
data
what
is
velocity
but
the
development
in
extension
of
the
intensity
of
the
momentum
impressed
on
a
material
point
now
the
intensity
of
the
momentum
is
an
absolute
quantity
equal
to
the
quantity
of
the
action
by
which
it
is
produced
hence
it
is
evident
that
as
the
action
has
an
absolute
value
greater
or
less
according
to
circumstances
so
also
the
momentum
impressed
has
an
absolute
value
and
consequently
the
velocity
also
which
is
nothing
else
than
the
momentum
itself
as
developing
its
intensity
into
extension
has
an
absolute
value
and
is
an
absolute
quantity
balmes
thought
the
contrary
for
the
following
reason
the
denominator
in
the
expression
of
velocity
were
a
quantity
of
the
same
kind
as
space
that
is
having
determinate
values
existing
and
conceivable
by
themselves
alone
the
velocity
although
still
a
relation
might
also
have
determinate
values
not
indeed
wholly
absolute
but
only
in
the
supposition
that
the
two
terms
and
having
fixed
values
are
but
from
the
difficulties
which
we
have
on
the
one
hand
seen
presented
to
the
consideration
of
time
as
an
absolute
thing
and
from
the
fact
that
on
the
other
hand
no
solid
proof
can
be
adduced
to
show
such
a
property
to
have
any
foundation
it
follows
that
we
know
not
how
to
consider
velocity
as
absolute
even
in
the
sense
above
loc
cit
this
reason
proves
the
contrary
of
what
the
author
intends
to
establish
in
fact
if
the
denominator
were
of
the
same
kind
as
the
numerator
the
quotient
would
be
an
abstract
number
as
we
know
from
mathematics
and
such
a
number
would
exhibit
nothing
more
than
the
relation
of
the
two
homogeneous
terms
that
is
how
many
times
the
one
is
contained
in
the
other
it
is
precisely
because
the
denominator
is
not
of
the
same
kind
as
the
numerator
that
the
quotient
must
be
of
the
same
kind
as
the
numerator
and
since
the
numerator
represents
space
which
according
to
balmes
is
an
absolute
quantity
it
follows
that
the
quotient
that
is
the
number
by
which
we
express
the
velocity
exhibits
a
quantity
of
the
same
nature
a
conclusion
in
which
all
mathematicians
agree
when
a
man
walks
a
mile
with
the
velocity
of
one
yard
per
second
he
measures
the
whole
mile
yard
by
yard
with
his
velocity
if
the
velocity
were
not
a
quantity
of
the
same
kind
with
the
space
measured
how
could
it
measure
it
true
it
is
that
velocity
when
considered
in
its
metaphysical
aspect
is
not
a
length
of
space
but
the
intensity
of
the
act
by
which
matter
is
carried
through
such
a
length
yet
since
balmes
argues
here
from
a
mathematical
equation
we
must
surmise
or
presume
that
he
considers
velocity
as
a
length
measured
in
space
in
the
unit
of
time
as
mathematicians
consider
it
for
he
can
not
argue
from
mathematical
expressions
with
logical
consistency
if
he
puts
upon
them
construction
of
an
unmathematical
character
after
all
it
remains
true
that
the
velocity
or
intensity
of
the
movement
is
always
to
be
measured
by
the
extension
of
the
movement
in
the
unit
of
time
and
thus
it
is
necessary
to
admit
that
velocity
exhibits
an
absolute
intensive
quantity
measured
by
the
extension
which
it
evolves
we
therefore
how
to
consider
velocity
as
absolute
though
its
mathematical
expression
is
drawn
from
a
relation
of
space
to
time
the
measure
of
any
quantity
is
always
found
by
comparing
the
quantity
with
some
unit
of
measure
hence
all
quantity
inasmuch
as
measured
exhibits
itself
under
a
relative
form
as
mensurati
ad
suam
and
it
is
only
under
such
a
form
that
it
can
be
expressed
in
numbers
but
this
relativity
does
not
constitute
the
nature
of
quantity
because
it
presupposes
it
and
has
the
whole
reason
of
its
being
in
the
process
of
mensuration
we
have
insisted
on
this
point
because
the
confusion
of
the
absolute
value
of
velocity
with
its
relative
mathematical
expression
would
lead
us
into
a
labyrinth
of
difficulties
with
regard
to
time
balmes
having
overlooked
the
distinction
between
the
mathematical
expression
and
the
metaphysical
character
of
velocity
comes
to
the
striking
consequence
that
the
whole
machine
of
the
universe
not
excluding
the
operations
of
our
soul
were
accelerated
or
retarded
an
impossibility
would
be
realized
for
the
relation
of
the
terms
would
have
to
be
changed
without
undergoing
any
change
if
the
velocity
be
only
the
relation
of
space
to
time
and
time
only
the
relation
of
spaces
traversed
it
is
the
same
thing
to
change
them
all
in
the
same
proportion
and
not
to
change
them
at
all
it
is
to
leave
every
thing
as
it
loc
cit
the
author
is
quite
mistaken
the
very
equation
on
which
he
grounds
his
argument
suffices
to
show
that
if
the
velocity
increases
the
time
employed
in
measuring
the
space
diminishes
and
if
the
velocity
diminishes
the
time
increases
this
being
the
case
it
is
evident
that
an
acceleration
of
the
movements
in
the
whole
machine
of
the
universe
would
be
a
acceleration
since
the
same
movements
would
be
performed
in
less
time
and
a
retardation
would
be
a
retardation
since
the
same
movements
would
require
more
time
we
are
therefore
far
from
realizing
an
impossibility
when
we
admit
that
in
the
hypothesis
of
the
author
time
would
vary
in
the
inverse
ratio
of
the
velocity
of
the
universal
movement
of
philosophers
divide
time
into
and
we
have
already
explained
this
division
when
speaking
of
flowing
duration
the
reality
of
time
evidently
depends
on
the
reality
of
movement
hence
any
time
to
which
no
real
movement
corresponds
is
imaginary
thus
if
you
dream
that
you
are
running
the
time
of
your
running
is
imaginary
because
your
running
too
is
imaginary
in
such
a
case
the
real
time
corresponds
to
your
real
movements
say
to
your
breathing
pulse
while
the
dream
continues
imaginary
time
is
often
called
also
time
but
this
last
epithet
is
not
correct
for
as
time
is
the
duration
of
local
movement
it
is
in
the
nature
of
time
to
be
an
object
of
the
imagination
and
for
this
reason
the
duration
of
the
intellectual
movements
and
operations
of
pure
spirits
is
called
time
only
by
analogy
as
we
have
above
stated
however
we
are
wont
to
think
of
such
a
duration
as
if
it
were
homogeneous
with
our
own
time
for
we
can
not
measure
it
except
by
reference
to
the
duration
of
the
movements
we
witness
in
the
material
world
time
is
also
divided
into
and
the
past
corresponds
to
a
movement
already
made
the
future
to
a
movement
which
will
be
made
and
the
present
to
a
movement
which
is
actually
going
on
but
some
will
ask
is
there
really
any
present
time
does
not
the
to
which
the
present
is
confined
exclude
all
and
all
and
therefore
all
succession
without
which
it
is
impossible
to
conceive
time
we
concede
that
the
as
such
that
is
considered
in
its
absolute
reality
is
not
time
just
as
a
point
is
not
a
line
for
as
the
point
has
no
length
so
the
has
no
extension
yet
as
a
point
in
motion
describes
a
line
so
also
the
by
its
flowing
from
to
extends
time
hence
although
the
as
such
is
not
time
its
flowing
from
to
is
time
if
then
we
consider
the
present
as
the
link
of
the
immediate
past
with
the
immediate
future
that
is
if
we
consider
the
not
statically
but
dynamically
we
shall
see
at
once
that
its
actual
flowing
from
to
implies
succession
and
constitutes
an
infinitesimal
interval
of
time
this
may
also
be
shown
by
reference
to
the
nature
of
uniform
local
movement
when
a
material
point
describes
a
line
with
uniform
velocity
its
movement
being
continuous
its
duration
is
continuous
and
therefore
every
flowing
instant
of
its
duration
is
continuous
as
no
discontinuous
parts
can
ever
be
reached
in
the
division
of
continuum
hence
every
flowing
instant
has
still
the
nature
of
time
this
conclusion
is
mathematically
evident
from
the
equation
for
being
supposed
constant
we
can
not
assume
unless
we
also
assume
but
this
latter
assumption
would
imply
rest
instead
of
movement
and
therefore
it
is
out
of
the
question
accordingly
at
no
instant
of
the
movement
can
we
assume
or
which
is
the
same
every
flowing
instant
partakes
the
nature
of
time
the
same
conclusion
can
be
established
even
more
evidently
by
the
consideration
of
accelerated
or
retarded
movements
when
a
stone
is
thrown
upwards
the
velocity
of
its
ascent
suffers
a
diminution
till
at
last
it
becomes
and
at
the
very
instant
it
becomes
an
opposite
velocity
begins
to
urge
the
stone
down
and
increases
continually
so
long
as
the
stone
does
not
reach
the
ground
or
any
other
obstacle
now
a
continuous
increase
or
decrease
of
the
velocity
means
that
there
are
not
two
consecutive
moments
of
time
in
which
the
stone
moves
at
exactly
the
same
rate
and
hence
nothing
but
an
instant
corresponds
to
each
successive
degree
of
velocity
but
since
the
duration
of
the
movement
is
made
up
of
nothing
but
such
instants
it
is
clear
that
the
succession
of
such
instants
constitutes
time
and
consequently
as
time
is
continuous
those
instants
though
infinitesimal
are
themselves
continuous
and
thus
every
flowing
instant
is
really
time
from
this
it
is
plain
first
that
although
the
as
such
is
not
time
yet
its
actual
flowing
is
time
secondly
it
follows
that
infinitesimals
of
time
as
employed
in
dynamics
are
not
mathematical
figments
but
realities
for
time
flows
only
through
infinitesimal
instants
and
therefore
to
deny
the
reality
of
such
infinitesimals
would
be
to
deny
the
reality
of
time
thirdly
we
gather
that
the
absolute
differs
from
an
actual
infinitesimal
of
time
because
the
former
as
such
is
only
a
term
of
time
whereas
the
latter
is
the
flowing
of
that
term
from
its
immediate
to
its
immediate
hence
an
infinitesimal
of
time
is
infinitely
less
than
any
designable
duration
in
fact
its
and
its
are
so
immediately
connected
with
the
same
absolute
that
there
is
no
room
for
any
designable
length
of
duration
between
them
fourthly
whilst
the
absolute
is
no
quantity
the
infinitesimal
of
time
is
a
real
quantity
for
it
implies
real
succession
this
quantity
however
is
nascent
or
only
for
the
which
alone
is
intercepted
between
the
immediate
and
the
immediate
has
no
formal
extension
fifthly
the
infinitesimal
of
time
corresponds
to
a
movement
by
which
an
infinitesimal
of
space
is
described
and
thus
infinitesimals
of
space
as
considered
in
dynamics
are
real
quantities
to
deny
that
such
infinitesimals
are
real
quantities
would
be
the
same
in
fact
as
to
deny
the
real
extension
of
local
movement
for
this
movement
flows
and
acquires
its
extension
through
such
infinitesimals
only
and
the
same
is
true
of
the
infinitesimal
actions
by
which
the
rate
of
local
movement
is
continually
modified
these
latter
infinitesimals
are
evidently
real
quantities
though
infinitely
less
than
any
designable
quantity
they
have
an
infinitesimal
intensity
and
they
cause
an
infinitesimal
change
in
the
rate
of
the
movement
in
an
infinitesimal
of
time
of
the
preceding
considerations
lead
us
to
understand
how
it
is
that
in
any
interval
of
time
there
is
but
one
absolute
always
the
same
but
changing
and
therefore
manifold
thomas
in
his
opuscule
c
explains
this
truth
in
the
following
words
a
point
to
the
line
so
is
the
to
the
time
if
we
imagine
a
point
at
rest
we
shall
not
be
able
to
find
in
it
the
causality
of
any
line
but
if
we
imagine
that
point
to
be
in
movement
then
although
it
has
no
dimensions
and
consequently
no
divisibility
in
itself
it
will
nevertheless
from
the
nature
of
its
movement
mark
out
a
divisible
the
point
however
does
in
no
way
belong
to
the
essence
of
the
line
for
one
and
the
same
real
term
absolutely
indivisible
can
not
be
at
the
same
time
in
different
parts
of
the
same
permanent
hence
the
mathematical
point
which
by
its
movement
draws
a
line
is
neither
the
line
nor
any
part
of
the
line
but
remaining
one
and
the
same
in
itself
it
acquires
different
modes
of
being
these
different
modes
of
being
which
must
be
traced
to
its
movement
are
really
in
the
line
whilst
the
point
as
such
has
no
place
in
it
in
the
same
manner
an
instant
which
is
the
measure
of
a
thing
movable
and
adheres
to
it
permanently
is
one
and
the
same
as
to
its
absolute
reality
so
long
as
the
substance
of
the
thing
remains
unimpaired
for
the
instant
is
the
inseparable
measure
of
its
being
but
the
same
instant
becomes
manifold
inasmuch
as
it
is
diversified
by
its
modes
of
being
and
it
is
this
its
diversity
that
constitutes
the
essence
of
from
this
explanation
we
may
infer
that
as
each
point
or
primitive
element
of
matter
has
its
own
one
in
its
absolute
reality
but
manifold
in
its
mode
of
being
there
are
in
nature
as
many
describing
distinct
lines
of
time
as
there
are
material
points
in
movement
accordingly
there
are
as
many
particular
times
as
there
are
elements
moving
in
space
the
proposition
that
in
time
there
is
only
instans
in
is
therefore
to
be
limited
to
the
particular
time
of
one
and
the
same
subject
of
motion
thomas
did
not
think
of
this
limitation
because
he
believed
according
to
the
old
astronomical
theory
that
the
movement
of
the
that
is
of
the
supreme
sphere
was
the
natural
measure
of
time
and
for
this
reason
he
thought
that
as
the
first
movement
was
one
time
also
was
one
and
constituted
the
common
measure
of
all
simultaneous
movements
but
the
truth
is
that
there
must
be
as
many
distinct
particular
times
as
there
are
things
actually
moving
this
is
a
manifest
consequence
of
the
doctrine
which
assimilates
a
flowing
to
a
point
describing
a
line
for
as
every
point
in
movement
describes
a
distinct
line
in
space
so
also
must
the
absolute
of
every
distinct
being
describe
by
its
flowing
a
distinct
line
of
time
the
general
time
which
we
regard
as
successive
duration
is
the
duration
of
the
movement
from
the
beginning
of
the
world
to
our
day
conceived
in
the
abstract
that
is
without
reference
to
the
particular
beings
concerned
in
the
movement
time
when
thus
conceived
is
a
mere
abstraction
whereas
the
particular
times
of
particular
movements
are
concrete
in
their
continuous
extension
notwithstanding
their
being
represented
by
abstract
numbers
if
we
knew
of
any
special
body
created
and
put
in
movement
before
any
other
body
we
might
regard
it
as
and
take
its
movement
if
uniform
as
the
natural
measure
or
standard
of
general
time
but
as
we
know
of
no
such
particular
body
and
as
we
have
reason
to
believe
that
the
creation
of
all
matter
was
made
in
one
and
the
same
moment
we
are
led
to
admit
an
exceedingly
great
multitude
of
every
one
of
which
was
from
the
beginning
of
time
the
subject
of
duration
it
is
clear
that
we
can
not
reduce
their
distinct
durations
to
one
general
duration
except
by
making
abstraction
of
all
particular
subjects
and
considering
movement
in
the
abstract
nevertheless
as
we
inhabit
the
earth
we
usually
restrict
our
consideration
of
time
to
those
periodical
intervals
of
duration
which
correspond
to
the
periodical
movements
we
witness
in
or
from
our
planet
and
thus
we
take
the
duration
of
the
diurnal
or
of
the
orbital
movement
of
the
earth
as
our
standard
for
the
measure
of
time
if
other
planets
are
inhabited
by
rational
beings
it
is
obvious
that
their
time
will
be
measured
by
other
standards
as
their
diurnal
and
orbital
movements
differ
from
those
of
our
earth
to
the
doctrine
that
time
is
evolved
by
the
flowing
of
a
single
instant
thomas
adds
an
important
remark
to
the
effect
that
the
of
contingent
things
should
not
be
confounded
with
the
of
eternity
he
proposes
to
himself
the
following
objection
stand
and
to
move
are
not
essential
differences
but
only
different
manners
of
being
but
the
of
eternity
is
standing
and
the
of
time
is
moving
the
one
therefore
seems
to
differ
from
the
other
in
nothing
but
in
the
manner
of
being
hence
the
of
time
would
be
substantially
the
same
as
the
of
eternity
which
is
thomas
replies
can
not
be
true
according
to
our
doctrine
for
we
have
seen
that
eternity
and
time
differ
essentially
moreover
when
of
two
things
the
one
depends
on
the
other
as
an
effect
from
a
cause
the
two
things
essentially
differ
but
the
of
eternity
which
does
not
really
differ
from
eternity
itself
is
the
cause
of
time
and
of
the
of
time
therefore
the
of
time
and
the
of
eternity
are
essentially
different
furthermore
the
of
time
unites
the
past
with
the
future
which
the
of
eternity
does
not
do
for
in
eternity
there
is
no
past
and
no
future
because
eternity
is
all
together
nor
has
the
objection
any
force
that
to
stand
and
to
move
do
not
constitute
an
essential
difference
is
true
of
those
things
which
are
liable
both
to
stand
and
to
move
but
that
which
always
stands
without
possibility
of
moving
differs
essentially
from
that
which
always
moves
without
the
possibility
of
standing
and
this
is
the
case
with
the
of
eternity
on
the
one
hand
and
the
of
time
on
the
of
here
the
question
arises
whether
time
must
have
had
a
beginning
those
who
believe
that
the
world
could
have
been
created
will
answer
that
time
could
have
existed
without
a
beginning
but
we
are
convinced
that
the
world
could
not
be
created
and
therefore
we
maintain
that
time
must
have
begun
our
argument
is
drawn
from
the
contingency
of
all
things
created
the
duration
of
a
contingent
being
can
not
be
without
a
beginning
for
the
contingent
being
itself
must
have
had
a
beginning
in
fact
as
that
can
not
be
annihilated
which
has
never
been
in
existence
so
that
can
not
be
educed
from
nothing
which
has
never
been
nothing
it
is
therefore
necessary
to
admit
that
every
creature
had
a
beginning
of
its
existence
and
consequently
of
its
duration
also
for
nothing
endures
but
inasmuch
as
it
exists
nor
can
this
argument
be
evaded
by
saying
that
a
contingent
being
may
have
without
having
this
distinction
though
suggested
and
employed
by
thomas
has
no
foundation
because
the
beginning
of
the
created
nature
is
the
beginning
also
of
its
duration
and
he
who
concedes
that
there
must
be
an
can
not
consistently
deny
the
in
fact
no
contingent
being
can
be
said
to
have
been
created
if
there
was
no
instant
in
which
it
was
created
in
other
terms
every
creature
must
be
traced
to
the
of
its
creation
but
the
of
its
creation
is
the
beginning
of
its
duration
no
less
than
of
its
existence
surely
whatever
has
a
first
has
a
beginning
of
duration
but
every
creature
has
its
first
the
of
its
creation
therefore
every
creature
has
a
beginning
of
duration
that
the
of
creation
is
the
first
is
for
the
of
creation
is
that
point
of
duration
in
which
the
passage
is
made
from
not
being
to
being
and
therefore
it
marks
the
beginning
of
the
existence
of
the
created
being
and
since
we
can
not
say
that
the
duration
of
the
created
being
preceded
its
existence
we
are
bound
to
conclude
that
the
of
its
creation
is
the
beginning
of
its
duration
as
well
as
of
its
existence
some
will
object
that
we
assume
what
is
to
be
proved
the
very
of
creation
for
if
the
world
had
been
created
no
of
creation
could
be
pointed
out
to
this
we
answer
that
the
of
creation
whether
we
can
point
it
out
determinately
or
not
must
always
be
admitted
to
suppress
it
is
to
suppress
creation
for
if
we
assume
that
a
thing
had
no
of
creation
we
are
compelled
to
deny
that
such
a
thing
has
ever
been
created
in
other
terms
if
anything
has
no
beginning
of
duration
it
was
always
in
act
it
never
lacked
actual
existence
and
it
never
passed
from
to
actual
existence
that
is
it
is
no
creature
at
all
for
to
be
a
creature
is
to
have
passed
from
to
actual
existence
and
thus
we
must
conclude
that
to
create
is
to
make
a
beginning
of
time
the
impossibility
of
a
world
created
has
also
been
argued
from
the
impossibility
of
an
infinite
ascending
series
the
force
of
this
proof
does
not
however
lie
in
the
absurdity
of
an
infinite
series
for
such
an
absurdity
as
thomas
remarks
has
never
been
demonstrated
but
it
lies
in
the
necessity
of
granting
a
beginning
to
every
term
of
the
series
itself
for
if
every
term
of
the
series
has
a
beginning
the
whole
series
must
have
a
beginning
thomas
as
we
have
just
stated
teaches
that
an
infinite
ascending
series
is
not
to
be
judged
impossible
if
it
were
a
series
of
efficient
causes
provided
it
depend
on
an
extrinsic
cause
infinitum
procedere
in
causis
agentibus
non
reputatur
this
doctrine
is
universally
rejected
and
was
fiercely
attacked
even
in
the
time
of
the
holy
doctor
but
he
persisted
in
maintaining
it
against
all
and
wrote
a
special
treatise
to
defend
it
the
reason
why
thomas
embraced
this
doctrine
seems
to
have
been
that
the
creation
of
the
world
in
the
beginning
of
time
was
an
article
of
faith
and
the
saint
believed
that
articles
of
faith
are
proved
only
by
authority
and
not
by
natural
reason
he
was
therefore
obliged
to
maintain
that
the
beginning
of
time
could
not
be
demonstrated
by
reason
alone
newness
of
the
world
says
he
can
not
be
demonstrated
from
the
consideration
of
the
world
itself
because
the
principle
of
demonstration
is
the
quiddity
of
things
now
things
when
considered
as
to
their
quiddity
or
species
do
not
involve
the
et
and
for
this
reason
the
universals
are
said
to
be
everywhere
and
in
all
time
hence
it
can
not
be
demonstrated
that
man
or
any
other
thing
did
not
always
to
this
argument
we
respectfully
reply
that
when
the
necessary
conditions
of
a
contingent
fact
are
to
be
demonstrated
the
principle
of
demonstration
is
not
the
abstract
quiddity
or
intelligible
essence
of
the
things
but
the
contingency
of
their
actual
existence
but
it
is
evident
that
whatever
exists
contingently
has
been
educed
out
of
nothing
it
is
therefore
necessary
to
conclude
that
all
contingent
things
have
had
a
first
moment
of
existence
and
of
duration
the
angelic
doctor
refers
also
to
a
similitude
by
which
some
philosophers
mentioned
by
augustine
undertook
to
explain
the
creation
if
a
foot
had
been
pressed
on
the
dust
the
impression
made
by
it
would
be
in
the
same
manner
the
world
might
have
been
for
god
its
maker
is
eternal
but
we
humbly
reply
that
the
impression
of
the
foot
on
the
dust
can
not
be
if
it
is
contingent
for
if
it
is
contingent
it
has
necessarily
a
beginning
of
its
existence
and
therefore
of
its
duration
also
as
we
have
already
shown
whatever
is
made
has
a
beginning
of
duration
hence
the
fathers
of
the
church
to
prove
that
the
divine
word
was
not
made
thought
it
sufficient
to
point
out
the
fact
that
he
was
like
his
father
thomas
after
stating
his
conclusion
that
the
temporal
beginning
of
the
world
is
not
demonstrable
but
simply
credible
remarks
as
follows
this
should
be
kept
in
mind
lest
by
presuming
to
demonstrate
what
is
matter
of
faith
by
insufficient
proofs
we
be
laughed
at
by
the
infidels
who
may
think
that
on
the
strength
of
such
proofs
we
believe
our
articles
of
this
advice
is
good
but
we
need
not
tell
our
readers
that
what
we
hold
as
of
faith
we
hold
on
divine
authority
irrespective
of
our
philosophical
reasons
of
that
time
may
go
on
without
end
is
an
evident
truth
but
will
it
go
on
for
ever
or
will
it
cease
at
last
to
this
question
we
answer
that
time
will
for
ever
continue
as
long
as
there
will
be
movement
there
will
be
time
there
will
ever
be
movement
therefore
there
will
ever
be
time
the
major
of
this
syllogism
needs
no
explanation
for
time
is
nothing
but
the
duration
of
movement
the
minor
is
quite
certain
for
not
only
the
rational
creatures
but
the
earth
itself
and
other
corporeal
things
will
last
for
ever
as
is
the
common
doctrine
of
philosophers
who
hold
that
god
will
never
destroy
what
he
has
created
these
material
things
will
therefore
continue
to
celebrate
glory
for
ever
that
is
will
continue
to
exert
their
motive
power
and
to
bring
about
divers
movements
for
such
is
their
nature
and
such
their
manner
of
chanting
the
praises
of
their
creator
moreover
we
know
by
faith
that
we
shall
rise
from
death
and
live
for
ever
and
that
the
glorious
bodies
of
the
saints
will
possess
besides
other
privileges
the
gift
of
agility
which
would
evidently
be
of
no
use
if
there
were
to
be
no
local
movement
and
no
succession
of
time
hence
it
follows
that
time
will
last
for
ever
and
let
no
one
say
that
the
sacred
scriptures
teach
the
contrary
for
wherever
the
sacred
scriptures
mention
end
of
they
speak
not
absolutely
and
universally
but
only
with
reference
to
certain
particular
periods
or
epochs
of
time
characterized
by
some
special
events
or
manifestation
of
divine
providence
thus
we
read
in
the
apocalypse
that
will
be
time
no
non
erit
and
yet
we
find
that
after
the
end
of
that
time
there
will
be
a
thousand
years
which
shows
that
the
phrase
will
be
time
no
refers
to
the
time
of
mercy
and
conversion
thus
also
we
read
in
daniel
that
has
its
habet
tempus
finem
but
we
see
by
the
context
that
he
speaks
there
of
the
antichristian
epoch
which
of
course
must
have
an
end
and
the
like
is
to
be
said
of
other
similar
passages
the
most
we
can
admit
in
regard
to
the
cessation
of
time
is
that
owing
to
the
great
catastrophe
and
the
wonderful
changes
which
the
consummation
of
the
present
epoch
shall
bring
about
the
diurnal
and
the
annual
revolutions
which
serve
now
as
measures
of
time
may
be
so
modified
as
to
give
rise
to
a
new
order
of
things
in
which
time
shall
be
measured
by
a
different
standard
this
seems
to
be
the
opinion
of
many
interpreters
of
the
sacred
scriptures
though
some
of
them
speak
as
if
after
the
consummation
of
the
present
things
there
were
to
be
time
no
more
but
only
eternity
this
manner
of
speaking
however
is
no
proof
against
the
continuance
of
time
for
the
word
when
applied
to
the
duration
of
creatures
means
nothing
else
than
sempiternity
that
is
time
without
end
according
to
the
scriptural
phrase
æternos
in
mente
we
learn
from
thomas
that
the
word
is
used
in
three
different
senses
first
we
call
eternity
the
measure
of
the
duration
of
a
thing
which
is
always
invariably
the
same
which
acquires
nothing
from
the
future
and
loses
nothing
from
the
past
and
this
is
the
most
proper
meaning
of
the
word
secondly
we
call
eternity
the
measure
of
the
duration
of
a
thing
which
has
a
fixed
and
perpetual
being
which
however
is
subject
to
accidental
changes
in
its
operations
eternity
when
thus
interpreted
means
what
we
should
call
properly
for
the
is
the
measure
of
those
things
whose
being
lasts
for
ever
but
which
admit
of
succession
in
their
operations
as
is
the
case
with
pure
intelligences
thirdly
we
call
eternity
the
measure
of
a
successive
duration
which
has
and
without
beginning
and
without
end
or
simply
without
end
though
it
have
a
beginning
and
in
this
sense
the
world
has
been
said
to
be
eternal
although
it
is
really
temporal
this
is
the
most
improper
meaning
of
the
word
for
the
true
concept
of
eternity
excludes
and
thus
far
thomas
we
may
be
allowed
to
remark
on
this
passage
that
according
to
the
principles
which
we
have
established
in
our
articles
on
not
only
the
pure
intelligences
but
all
primitive
and
elementary
substances
are
substantially
incorruptible
and
have
a
fixed
and
permanent
being
hence
the
distinction
made
by
the
holy
doctor
between
and
endless
time
ceases
to
have
a
foundation
and
the
whole
difference
between
the
endless
duration
of
spiritual
and
of
material
changes
will
be
reduced
to
this
that
the
movements
of
spiritual
substances
are
intellectual
whereas
those
of
the
material
elements
are
local
phrase
we
often
hear
of
such
expressions
as
these
creation
there
was
god
alone
creation
there
was
no
time
etc
and
since
such
expressions
seem
to
involve
a
contradiction
in
terms
we
think
it
will
not
be
superfluous
to
give
their
rational
explanation
of
course
if
the
words
be
understood
absolutely
that
is
excluding
any
creation
either
made
or
imagined
those
words
will
be
contradictory
for
the
preposition
is
relative
and
implies
succession
and
it
is
contradictory
to
suppose
succession
without
anything
capable
of
succession
when
no
creature
existed
there
could
be
nothing
flowing
from
to
because
there
was
no
movement
there
being
nothing
movable
nor
can
it
be
said
that
the
of
divine
eternity
gives
us
a
sufficient
ground
for
imagining
any
and
without
referring
to
something
exterior
to
god
himself
the
of
eternity
has
in
itself
neither
nor
and
when
we
say
that
it
is
equivalent
to
all
imaginable
time
we
do
not
affirm
that
it
implies
succession
but
only
acknowledge
that
it
is
the
supreme
reason
of
the
possibility
of
succession
in
created
things
hence
when
we
use
the
phrase
in
an
absolute
sense
we
in
fact
take
away
all
real
and
all
real
and
thus
the
words
creation
taken
absolutely
involve
a
contradiction
they
affirm
explicitly
what
they
implicitly
deny
the
truth
is
that
when
we
use
the
phrase
in
question
we
express
what
is
in
our
imagination
and
not
in
our
intellect
we
imagine
that
before
time
there
was
eternity
because
we
can
not
picture
to
ourselves
eternity
except
by
the
phantasm
of
infinite
time
it
is
for
this
reason
that
in
speaking
of
eternity
we
use
the
terms
by
which
we
are
accustomed
to
express
the
relations
of
time
the
words
are
therefore
to
be
understood
of
a
time
which
was
possible
in
connection
with
some
possible
anterior
creation
but
which
has
never
existed
this
amounts
to
saying
that
the
which
we
conceive
has
no
existence
except
in
our
imagination
thomas
proposes
to
himself
the
question
whether
when
we
say
that
god
was
before
the
world
the
term
is
to
be
interpreted
of
a
priority
of
nature
or
of
a
priority
of
duration
it
might
seem
says
he
that
neither
interpretation
is
admissible
for
if
god
is
before
the
world
only
by
priority
of
nature
then
it
follows
that
since
god
is
the
world
too
is
if
on
the
contrary
god
is
before
the
world
by
priority
of
duration
then
since
priority
and
posteriority
of
duration
constitute
time
it
follows
that
there
was
time
before
the
creation
of
the
world
which
is
impossible
in
answer
to
this
difficulty
the
holy
doctor
says
that
god
is
before
the
world
by
priority
of
duration
but
that
the
preposition
designates
here
the
priority
not
of
time
but
of
eternity
or
else
we
must
answer
he
adds
that
the
word
designates
a
priority
not
of
real
but
of
imaginary
time
just
as
the
word
in
the
phrase
the
heavens
there
is
designates
an
imaginary
space
which
we
may
conceive
by
thinking
of
some
imaginary
dimensions
superadded
to
the
dimensions
of
the
heavens
it
strikes
us
that
the
first
of
these
two
answers
does
not
really
solve
the
difficulty
for
the
priority
of
eternity
can
not
mean
but
a
priority
of
nature
and
of
by
which
permanent
duration
infinitely
rather
than
all
duration
of
creatures
in
accordance
with
this
the
objector
might
still
urge
on
his
conclusion
that
if
god
does
not
precede
the
world
the
world
is
like
god
himself
the
second
answer
agrees
with
what
we
ourselves
have
hitherto
said
but
as
regards
the
objection
proposed
it
leaves
the
difficulty
entire
for
if
god
was
before
the
world
by
a
priority
not
of
real
but
of
imaginary
time
that
is
imaginary
and
not
real
and
the
consequence
will
be
that
god
was
not
really
the
world
but
we
imagine
him
to
have
been
so
we
must
own
that
with
our
imperfect
language
mostly
fashioned
by
imagination
it
is
not
easy
to
give
a
clear
and
popular
solution
of
the
objection
perhaps
the
most
summary
manner
of
dealing
with
it
would
be
to
deny
the
inference
in
the
first
horn
of
the
dilemma
that
if
god
is
before
the
world
by
priority
of
nature
only
then
the
world
will
be
as
much
as
god
himself
this
inference
we
say
is
to
be
denied
for
it
involves
the
false
supposition
that
a
thing
is
if
there
is
no
time
before
it
whereas
that
only
is
which
has
no
beginning
of
duration
thus
there
is
no
need
of
saying
that
god
the
world
in
duration
for
it
suffices
to
admit
that
he
was
before
the
world
by
priority
of
nature
and
of
causality
the
duration
of
eternity
has
no
and
no
though
we
depict
it
to
ourselves
as
extending
into
indefinite
time
even
the
verb
should
not
be
predicated
of
god
for
god
strictly
speaking
neither
was
nor
will
be
but
permanently
hence
it
seems
to
us
that
it
would
be
a
contradiction
to
affirm
that
god
was
the
world
by
the
duration
of
his
eternity
while
we
acknowledge
that
in
his
eternity
there
is
no
but
enough
about
this
question
duration
of
supposing
that
a
body
or
an
element
of
matter
is
perfectly
at
rest
it
may
be
asked
how
the
duration
of
this
rest
can
be
ascertained
and
measured
shall
we
answer
that
it
is
measured
by
time
but
if
so
our
reader
will
immediately
conclude
that
time
is
not
merely
the
duration
of
movement
as
we
have
defined
it
but
also
the
duration
of
rest
on
the
other
hand
how
can
we
deny
that
rest
is
measured
by
time
when
we
often
speak
of
the
rest
of
a
few
minutes
or
of
a
few
hours
we
might
evade
the
question
by
answering
that
nothing
in
creation
lies
in
absolute
rest
but
everything
is
acting
and
acted
upon
without
interruption
so
that
its
movement
is
never
suspended
but
we
answer
directly
that
if
there
were
absolute
rest
anywhere
in
the
world
the
duration
of
that
rest
should
be
measured
by
the
duration
of
exterior
movements
in
fact
rest
has
no
and
in
itself
because
it
is
immovable
but
only
outside
of
itself
it
can
not
therefore
have
an
intrinsic
measure
of
its
duration
but
it
must
borrow
it
from
the
and
of
exterior
movement
in
other
words
the
thing
which
is
in
perfect
rest
draws
no
line
of
time
it
has
only
a
statical
which
is
a
mere
term
of
duration
and
if
everything
in
the
world
were
in
absolute
rest
time
would
cease
altogether
hence
what
we
call
the
duration
of
rest
is
simply
the
duration
of
a
movement
exterior
to
the
thing
which
is
at
rest
this
will
be
easily
understood
by
considering
that
between
a
flowing
and
a
standing
there
is
the
same
relation
as
between
a
moving
and
a
standing
point
now
to
change
the
relation
of
distance
between
two
points
in
space
it
suffices
that
one
of
them
move
while
the
other
stands
still
this
change
of
distance
is
measured
by
the
movement
of
the
first
point
and
thus
the
point
which
is
at
rest
undergoes
without
moving
a
continuous
change
in
its
relation
to
the
moving
point
in
a
similar
manner
two
being
given
the
one
flowing
and
the
other
standing
the
time
extended
by
the
flowing
of
the
first
measures
the
change
of
its
relation
to
the
second
and
consequently
also
the
change
of
the
relation
of
the
second
to
the
first
this
shows
that
the
time
by
which
we
measure
the
duration
of
rest
is
nothing
but
the
duration
of
the
movement
extrinsic
to
the
thing
at
rest
but
as
we
have
said
nothing
in
creation
is
in
absolute
rest
and
therefore
what
we
consider
as
resting
has
really
some
movement
imperceptible
to
our
senses
as
molecular
vibrations
by
which
the
duration
of
its
supposed
rest
is
intrinsically
measured
in
eternity
alone
there
is
perfect
immobility
but
its
duration
can
not
be
measured
by
time
even
as
an
extrinsic
measure
because
the
standing
duration
of
eternity
has
nothing
common
with
the
flowing
duration
of
creatures
as
local
movement
can
not
measure
divine
immensity
so
flowing
duration
can
not
measure
divine
eternity
because
as
the
of
a
creature
never
changes
its
relation
to
immensity
so
the
of
a
creature
never
changes
its
relation
to
eternity
of
we
will
conclude
with
a
few
remarks
on
the
continuity
of
time
that
time
is
essentially
continuous
is
evident
but
the
question
has
been
proposed
what
if
god
were
to
annihilate
all
existing
creatures
and
to
make
a
new
creation
would
the
instant
of
annihilation
be
immediately
followed
by
the
instant
of
the
new
creation
or
could
there
be
an
interval
of
time
between
them
the
right
answer
to
this
question
is
that
between
the
annihilation
and
the
new
creation
there
would
be
no
time
because
there
can
not
be
time
without
succession
and
no
succession
without
creatures
yet
it
would
not
follow
that
the
instant
of
the
annihilation
should
be
immediately
united
with
the
instant
of
the
new
creation
in
other
words
the
duration
of
the
new
world
would
not
be
a
continuation
of
the
duration
of
the
world
annihilated
the
reason
of
this
is
that
there
can
not
be
a
continuation
of
time
unless
the
same
continues
to
flow
for
when
one
flowing
ceases
to
be
and
another
begins
the
line
of
time
drawn
by
the
first
comes
to
an
end
and
another
line
altogether
distinct
begins
and
this
latter
can
not
be
a
continuation
of
the
former
if
the
english
mail
for
instance
reaches
new
york
at
a
given
instant
and
the
french
mail
at
the
same
instant
starts
from
paris
no
one
will
say
that
the
movement
of
the
french
mail
is
a
continuation
of
the
movement
of
the
english
mail
hence
the
duration
of
the
movement
of
the
one
is
not
the
continuation
of
that
of
the
other
moreover
from
what
we
have
seen
about
the
distinct
lines
of
time
described
by
distinct
subjects
of
flowing
duration
it
is
plain
that
even
the
durations
of
simultaneous
movements
are
always
distinct
from
one
another
as
belonging
to
distinct
subjects
and
accordingly
when
one
of
the
said
movements
ceases
the
continuation
of
the
others
can
not
be
looked
upon
as
its
continuation
hence
if
the
present
world
were
annihilated
its
duration
would
cease
altogether
and
the
duration
of
a
world
would
draw
a
new
line
of
time
quite
distinct
from
that
of
the
present
world
though
between
the
end
of
the
one
and
the
beginning
of
the
other
there
would
be
no
time
two
worlds
in
question
as
balmes
remarks
have
no
mutual
relation
consequently
there
would
be
neither
distance
nor
immediateness
between
time
is
continuous
formal
continuity
we
call
that
of
which
all
the
constituent
elements
have
their
own
formal
and
distinct
existence
in
nature
in
time
such
elements
are
those
flowing
instants
which
unite
the
immediate
past
with
the
immediate
future
this
continuity
is
essentially
successive
it
is
owing
to
its
successivity
that
time
as
well
as
movement
can
be
and
is
formally
continuous
for
no
formal
continuum
can
be
simultaneous
as
we
have
shown
where
we
refuted
the
hypothesis
of
continuous
matter
but
let
this
suffice
about
time
an
incident
of
the
reign
of
terror
the
close
of
the
xviiith
century
found
the
good
people
of
these
united
states
in
a
most
amiable
mood
the
consciousness
of
all
they
had
achieved
by
sustaining
their
declaration
of
independence
in
the
face
of
overwhelming
difficulties
produced
a
glow
of
national
that
has
thrown
its
glamour
over
the
first
page
of
our
public
annals
which
as
history
counts
her
pages
by
centuries
we
are
only
now
preparing
to
turn
not
until
we
were
drawing
near
its
close
was
the
light
of
that
agreeable
illusion
obscured
by
the
shadow
of
a
question
whether
the
was
not
like
to
prove
after
all
a
most
failure
is
never
an
elevating
sentiment
and
seldom
sustained
by
the
merits
upon
the
assumed
possession
of
which
it
is
based
but
our
people
had
many
substantial
virtues
sufficient
to
atone
abundantly
for
their
indulgence
in
a
pleasant
foible
among
these
was
the
principle
of
gratitude
to
which
none
but
truly
noble
natures
are
subject
that
they
possessed
it
was
proved
by
their
promptness
in
hastening
to
relieve
and
comfort
the
french
refugees
whom
the
reign
of
terror
had
driven
to
our
shores
when
it
was
devastating
that
fair
realm
across
the
atlantic
which
had
been
the
first
to
extend
assistance
and
sympathy
to
us
in
the
hour
of
need
we
have
vivid
recollections
of
sitting
for
hours
patchwork
in
hand
at
the
feet
of
a
dear
relative
in
the
pleasant
home
of
our
childhood
listening
to
thrilling
tales
of
those
times
many
of
them
connected
with
the
french
emigrants
of
the
cordial
hospitality
with
which
all
the
homes
of
her
native
city
of
hartford
were
thrown
open
to
receive
these
interesting
exiles
of
the
shifts
the
inhabitants
devised
and
the
discomforts
they
endured
in
order
to
provide
comfortable
shelter
and
sustenance
for
so
many
from
means
already
impoverished
by
the
drain
of
the
conflict
through
which
we
ourselves
had
but
just
passed
now
this
dear
relative
was
the
possessor
of
a
small
gold
locket
of
antique
fashion
and
exquisite
workmanship
which
was
an
object
of
unceasing
admiration
to
our
childish
fancy
in
form
it
was
an
oblong
octagon
the
border
was
a
graceful
tiny
pattern
in
inlaid
with
amethyst
and
pearl
in
the
centre
were
two
miniatures
painted
on
glass
with
marvellous
distinctness
and
accuracy
the
one
a
likeness
of
that
most
unfortunate
queen
marie
antoinette
the
other
of
her
beloved
the
amiable
princess
elizabeth
a
heavy
pebble
crystal
perfectly
transparent
covered
the
pictures
without
in
the
least
obscuring
their
delicate
tints
in
the
back
of
the
locket
was
an
open
space
within
which
our
relative
said
was
once
laid
upon
the
ground
of
dark
satin
that
still
remained
a
knot
formed
by
two
small
locks
of
glossy
silken
hair
one
a
light
auburn
the
other
flaxen
with
a
golden
sheen
a
glass
covered
these
also
after
much
persuasion
our
relative
related
to
us
the
following
story
of
the
locket
my
father
was
an
officer
in
the
continental
army
and
soon
after
the
war
of
our
revolution
closed
returned
to
his
former
home
in
the
city
of
hartford
where
he
accepted
an
office
of
high
municipal
trust
he
was
moved
by
the
generous
impulses
of
his
nature
to
a
life
of
active
benevolence
and
when
in
the
revolution
in
france
drove
thousands
of
her
citizens
to
take
refuge
in
our
republic
none
were
more
zealous
and
untiring
than
he
in
seeking
out
and
providing
for
the
unfortunate
strangers
every
apartment
in
our
spacious
house
was
soon
filled
rooms
were
prepared
in
the
and
barns
for
my
brothers
and
the
domestics
of
the
household
while
my
sisters
and
myself
took
possession
of
a
small
room
in
the
attic
which
had
been
a
repository
for
the
spare
bedding
now
called
into
use
among
our
guests
was
one
lady
who
was
distinguished
by
having
a
spacious
room
set
apart
for
her
sole
use
and
who
seldom
left
it
or
mingled
with
her
companions
in
misfortune
and
exile
upon
the
rare
occasions
when
she
did
appear
briefly
in
their
circle
it
was
striking
to
observe
the
ceremonious
deference
amounting
almost
to
veneration
with
which
she
was
received
where
or
how
my
father
found
her
i
never
knew
but
his
manner
towards
her
was
so
profoundly
respectful
as
to
impress
us
all
with
feelings
akin
to
fear
in
her
presence
yet
these
impressions
were
produced
by
the
demeanor
of
others
only
for
on
her
own
part
there
was
not
the
slightest
or
assumption
of
stateliness
simple
and
unobtrusive
as
a
child
in
her
manners
she
was
indescribably
affable
to
all
but
her
countenance
wore
an
expression
which
when
once
seen
could
never
be
forgotten
more
forcibly
and
clearly
than
words
did
it
convey
the
story
that
some
overwhelming
deluge
of
calamity
had
swept
from
her
life
every
vestige
of
earthly
hope
and
joy
by
no
outward
token
did
she
parade
her
griefs
her
dress
plain
even
severe
in
its
perfect
neatness
and
simplicity
displayed
no
but
her
very
smile
was
an
intimate
revelation
of
sorrow
she
was
known
by
the
title
of
though
some
of
our
guests
would
now
and
then
add
when
speaking
of
her
in
an
undertone
not
lost
upon
a
small
listener
like
myself
her
celeste
was
entirely
devoted
to
her
and
always
served
her
slight
and
simple
meals
to
her
in
her
own
room
soon
after
her
arrival
i
was
sent
on
some
errand
to
apartment
and
her
agitation
upon
seeing
me
was
a
thing
to
be
remembered
for
a
lifetime
she
drew
me
to
her
bosom
caressing
me
with
many
tears
suppressed
sobs
and
rapid
exclamations
in
her
own
language
i
learned
afterwards
from
celeste
that
i
was
of
the
same
age
and
bore
a
striking
resemblance
in
form
and
face
to
her
daughter
who
had
been
torn
from
her
in
the
storm
and
turmoil
of
their
escape
they
had
been
rescued
by
a
faithful
servant
and
hurried
off
more
dead
than
alive
in
the
fright
confusion
and
uproar
of
a
terrible
outbreak
in
paris
and
had
discovered
when
too
late
that
her
daughter
had
been
separated
from
them
and
was
missing
their
deliverer
promised
to
make
every
possible
effort
to
find
the
child
but
celeste
had
little
hope
for
she
had
heard
from
the
servant
of
another
lady
who
escaped
later
but
had
never
told
her
mistress
that
one
of
the
women
who
daily
watched
the
carts
which
conveyed
the
victims
to
the
guillotine
had
averred
that
she
was
sure
she
saw
the
child
among
their
number
from
the
first
i
was
a
welcome
visitor
in
the
room
she
encouraged
me
to
pass
all
the
time
with
her
which
could
be
spared
from
household
duties
for
in
those
days
every
child
was
required
to
perform
a
portion
of
these
the
schools
in
hartford
were
for
the
most
part
closed
during
that
period
that
the
buildings
might
be
devoted
to
the
accommodation
of
the
strangers
who
requited
the
kindness
by
teaching
the
children
of
each
household
where
they
were
entertained
daily
i
was
the
chosen
pupil
of
madame
she
soon
imparted
sufficient
knowledge
of
the
french
to
give
her
instructions
in
her
own
language
never
was
child
blest
with
a
more
gentle
and
painstaking
teacher
to
a
thorough
course
in
the
simple
branches
of
study
she
added
many
delicate
accomplishments
then
unknown
in
our
country
and
the
most
patient
training
in
all
matters
connected
with
dress
and
deportment
after
lessons
she
would
hold
long
conversations
with
me
more
profitable
than
the
lessons
themselves
awakening
interest
by
suggestions
and
inquiries
tending
to
form
habits
of
thinking
as
well
as
of
acquiring
knowledge
then
such
wonderful
fairy
tales
as
she
would
relate
i
used
to
listen
perfectly
entranced
never
have
i
heard
in
english
any
fairy
lore
that
would
compare
with
it
translations
we
may
have
but
the
fairy
charm
of
the
original
is
lost
at
that
time
the
spirit
of
infidelity
and
atheism
which
laid
the
train
for
the
horrors
of
the
french
revolution
prevailed
widely
in
our
own
country
when
too
young
to
comprehend
their
import
i
had
often
listened
to
warm
discussions
between
my
father
who
was
strongly
tinctured
with
those
opinions
while
in
politics
he
was
an
and
my
maternal
grandfather
a
and
tory
the
latter
always
insisted
and
it
was
all
i
understood
of
their
conversations
that
it
was
impossible
for
a
government
founded
upon
popular
unbelief
and
insubordination
to
stand
he
was
utterly
hopeless
for
ours
not
because
it
was
democratic
in
form
but
because
the
people
no
longer
reverenced
authority
had
ceased
to
be
imbued
with
the
first
principle
of
loyalty
to
god
as
supreme
ruler
and
to
the
that
as
his
appointed
instruments
these
subjects
were
themes
of
constant
debate
and
were
treated
with
a
warmth
that
commanded
even
the
notice
of
children
some
of
our
guests
affected
a
gay
and
careless
indifference
to
the
claims
of
god
and
man
that
amounted
to
a
rejection
of
both
others
vehemently
denounced
all
religion
as
a
figment
of
while
still
another
class
met
such
questions
with
the
solemnity
arising
from
a
conviction
of
the
tremendous
temporal
and
eternal
interests
which
they
involved
it
was
refreshing
to
steal
away
from
these
evening
debates
in
the
to
the
peaceful
atmosphere
of
apartment
i
frequently
found
her
saying
her
beads
of
which
i
knew
nothing
only
that
they
were
exceedingly
beautiful
to
the
sight
and
composed
of
very
costly
materials
i
used
to
enter
her
room
very
quietly
and
take
my
accustomed
seat
in
silence
until
her
devotions
were
closed
of
her
religion
i
knew
no
more
than
the
name
but
its
evident
influence
upon
every
action
of
her
life
left
an
indelible
impression
upon
my
mind
that
it
was
a
power
above
and
beyond
any
of
the
prevailing
forms
around
us
she
never
spoke
expressly
of
her
religion
to
me
but
the
purely
christian
tone
of
her
instructions
upon
all
the
duties
of
life
social
and
domestic
exemplified
by
her
own
conduct
proved
abundantly
that
it
was
more
than
a
mere
sentiment
or
a
name
i
was
too
young
at
that
time
to
reason
upon
these
things
but
as
i
have
said
they
left
an
indelible
impression
and
as
life
advanced
furnished
food
for
many
reveries
which
at
length
ripened
into
serious
thought
how
the
weary
months
must
have
dragged
along
for
those
exiled
unfortunates
yet
the
cheerfulness
even
gayety
with
which
they
endured
their
misfortunes
and
the
torturing
suspense
of
their
position
was
a
matter
of
constant
marvel
to
their
new
england
friends
they
watched
the
arrival
of
every
ship
from
france
with
intense
anxiety
and
a
renewal
of
grief
and
mourning
was
sure
to
follow
the
tidings
it
brought
yet
the
polite
amenities
and
courtesies
of
their
daily
life
which
seemed
a
part
of
their
nature
were
never
for
a
moment
abated
and
in
the
wildest
storm
of
grief
even
the
women
never
lost
that
exquisite
sense
of
propriety
which
distinguishes
their
nation
and
so
the
time
wore
on
until
a
certain
memorable
night
in
september
my
residence
was
situated
upon
an
elevated
street
which
commanded
a
wide
view
of
the
city
and
its
environs
how
well
i
remember
standing
with
my
sisters
by
the
window
of
our
attic
dormitory
looking
out
upon
the
quiet
city
sleeping
under
the
calm
light
of
the
harvest
moon
on
that
night
the
contemplation
of
the
scene
was
too
pleasant
to
be
easily
relinquished
and
it
was
late
before
we
could
turn
away
from
its
fascinations
to
our
rest
we
were
scarcely
lost
in
sleep
when
we
were
awakened
suddenly
by
a
thrilling
shout
in
the
street
accompanied
by
the
wild
huzzahs
of
an
excited
multitude
we
hastened
to
the
lower
rooms
where
we
found
the
strangers
gathered
around
the
open
windows
from
which
they
were
waving
handkerchiefs
hats
and
scarfs
and
mingling
their
shouts
with
those
of
the
throng
outside
in
the
street
the
city
crier
moved
along
in
advance
of
the
crowd
mounted
on
a
tall
white
horse
and
waving
an
immense
banner
at
every
crossing
he
would
pause
and
shout
through
a
rejoice
robespierre
the
tyrant
has
fallen
has
fallen
then
followed
the
jubilant
cheers
of
the
crowd
and
so
they
passed
on
through
every
street
in
the
city
i
sought
apartment
and
found
her
kneeling
in
the
same
reverent
attitude
of
humble
devotion
with
which
i
had
so
long
been
familiar
strange
to
say
my
first
thought
upon
hearing
the
news
so
joyful
to
others
was
one
of
dismal
apprehension
and
my
first
emotion
one
of
ineffable
sadness
quick
as
thought
came
the
painful
assurance
to
my
heart
that
this
was
the
signal
for
my
final
separation
from
the
loving
friend
the
gentle
teacher
to
whom
i
had
become
inexpressibly
attached
as
she
arose
and
extended
her
arms
towards
me
i
threw
myself
into
them
and
hiding
my
face
in
her
bosom
gave
way
to
a
burst
of
uncontrollable
grief
words
were
not
necessary
to
explain
its
cause
understanding
it
at
a
glance
she
caressed
and
soothed
me
with
assurances
of
her
undying
love
and
that
she
could
never
forget
or
cease
to
pray
for
the
child
whom
heaven
had
appointed
to
be
her
dearest
consolation
under
her
great
afflictions
my
apprehensions
proved
well
founded
the
same
ship
which
brought
tidings
of
the
fall
brought
letters
also
to
madame
from
faithful
friends
urging
her
immediate
return
to
france
my
father
accompanied
her
to
boston
in
order
to
make
needful
preparation
for
her
departure
on
the
next
vessel
i
was
thrown
into
such
an
agony
of
grief
at
the
thought
of
parting
with
her
that
madame
begged
i
might
be
permitted
to
go
with
them
urging
that
the
change
of
scene
and
a
visit
to
relatives
in
boston
might
divert
my
thoughts
and
soothe
the
bitter
anguish
of
my
young
heart
he
consented
and
when
we
reached
the
city
he
left
us
at
the
house
of
his
sister
where
i
found
my
cousins
all
engaged
preparing
for
an
examination
and
exhibition
which
was
to
take
place
the
next
day
to
close
the
term
of
the
school
they
were
attending
on
the
same
street
and
near
by
they
insisted
that
i
should
go
with
them
and
madame
dressed
me
in
a
white
muslin
with
a
blue
sash
she
then
hung
the
locket
you
so
much
admire
suspended
from
a
delicate
gold
chain
around
my
neck
and
i
set
off
with
my
cousins
we
found
the
girls
grouped
together
in
great
glee
awaiting
the
opening
exercises
in
the
centre
of
the
group
was
a
fair
and
graceful
girl
near
my
own
age
and
size
with
a
large
basket
containing
bouquets
of
flowers
arranged
with
admirable
taste
which
the
girls
were
purchasing
for
themselves
and
to
decorate
the
my
cousins
replied
to
my
questions
about
the
young
stranger
we
call
her
the
little
flower
girl
she
lives
with
a
farmer
just
out
of
the
city
the
family
are
very
fond
of
her
and
he
gives
her
a
little
place
in
the
garden
to
cultivate
flowers
and
lets
her
come
with
him
on
market
days
to
sell
them
for
herself
in
the
city
she
heard
of
what
was
going
on
here
and
thought
this
would
be
a
good
market
for
her
bouquets
and
so
it
has
been
for
she
has
sold
them
for
some
reason
i
could
not
turn
my
eyes
from
the
child
there
seemed
to
be
a
mutual
fascination
which
drew
us
together
and
i
observed
she
was
looking
intently
and
with
much
emotion
at
the
locket
i
wore
i
asked
her
why
she
was
so
much
interested
in
it
she
answered
with
a
slight
french
accent
mamma
had
such
a
locket
and
all
the
ladies
of
the
household
wore
where
is
your
mamma
i
inquired
i
do
not
know
if
she
is
living
i
lost
her
in
a
great
crowd
in
the
streets
of
paris
and
was
so
frightened
at
the
horrors
around
me
that
i
remember
nothing
until
i
found
myself
on
board
the
ship
which
brought
me
here
how
i
came
there
i
never
knew
the
farmer
with
whom
i
live
was
on
the
wharf
when
we
landed
and
in
great
pity
for
my
bewildering
loneliness
and
grief
took
me
to
his
home
where
i
have
since
received
every
attention
and
almost
sinking
under
agitation
i
turned
to
my
cousins
who
had
been
too
much
occupied
with
their
own
affairs
to
notice
us
and
faintly
gasped
is
she
must
be
the
daughter
for
whom
madame
mourns
at
the
bare
suggestion
all
else
was
forgotten
there
was
an
impetuous
huddling
of
our
electrified
companions
around
the
bewildered
little
stranger
and
a
petition
that
the
school
exercises
might
be
delayed
until
they
could
escort
her
to
my
aunt
and
learn
whether
my
conjecture
was
true
so
great
was
their
excitement
that
it
was
useless
to
deny
the
request
and
we
led
our
heroine
off
with
hasty
steps
on
the
way
we
decided
that
my
aunt
should
break
the
matter
gently
to
madame
and
introduce
the
child
to
her
in
her
room
there
was
no
need
of
an
introduction
the
moment
their
eyes
met
the
exclamations
burst
from
their
lips
and
my
aunt
left
them
locked
in
a
close
embrace
the
scene
was
too
sacred
for
intrusion
the
news
flew
with
the
speed
of
the
wind
and
there
were
great
rejoicings
far
and
near
over
the
timely
discovery
brought
about
by
means
of
the
locket
which
madame
bestowed
upon
me
after
removing
the
knot
of
hair
too
precious
as
a
relic
of
her
lamented
queen
and
the
princess
elizabeth
to
be
relinquished
in
memory
of
this
joyful
event
and
as
a
souvenir
of
the
beloved
friend
and
teacher
with
whom
i
had
passed
so
many
happy
and
profitable
hours
soon
after
the
reunion
of
the
mother
and
child
they
sailed
for
france
and
i
returned
with
my
father
to
a
home
which
was
now
bereft
of
a
charm
that
could
never
be
replaced
or
restored
but
my
sympathy
with
their
joy
was
too
sincere
to
be
chilled
by
selfish
regrets
during
my
stay
in
boston
he
made
some
final
arrangements
connected
with
a
large
territory
of
wild
lands
which
he
had
received
from
the
government
in
partial
requital
of
his
services
in
the
army
to
that
distant
wilderness
he
removed
his
family
immediately
after
our
return
the
absence
of
mail
communication
with
such
remote
districts
in
those
days
was
doubtless
the
reason
why
we
never
received
further
tidings
from
one
who
had
placed
us
among
the
favored
few
that
entertained
angels
in
the
loneliness
of
my
forest
home
and
through
a
long
life
marked
by
many
changes
and
sorrows
i
have
cherished
grateful
memories
of
the
early
lessons
i
received
from
her
lips
and
they
have
proved
through
their
influence
upon
my
religious
and
moral
being
a
legacy
far
more
precious
than
a
thousand
caskets
of
gold
and
precious
stones
the
charities
of
rome
the
present
sacrilegious
invaders
of
rome
have
done
much
to
change
the
religious
aspect
of
the
city
and
obliterate
every
trace
of
the
influence
of
the
popes
upon
the
charities
once
so
liberally
thrown
open
to
the
people
of
every
clime
and
color
in
the
true
spirit
of
modern
philanthropy
has
usurped
the
place
of
charity
and
the
state
taking
possession
of
institutions
founded
and
hitherto
directed
in
many
points
by
the
church
banishes
her
as
far
from
them
as
possible
it
may
be
interesting
to
pass
in
review
some
of
those
magnificent
charities
which
sprang
up
and
flourished
so
long
under
pontifical
protection
but
which
have
lately
either
been
violently
suppressed
or
are
fast
disappearing
under
the
difficulties
of
the
political
situation
we
will
write
of
these
charities
as
they
existed
in
which
was
the
last
year
during
the
whole
of
which
the
papal
government
had
control
of
them
in
that
year
an
english
protestant
writer
long
resident
in
rome
was
obliged
by
the
clearness
of
facts
to
tell
his
readers
that
cities
in
europe
are
so
distinguished
for
their
institutions
of
public
charity
as
rome
and
in
none
are
the
hospitals
more
magnificently
lodged
or
endowed
with
more
princely
liberality
the
annual
endowments
of
these
establishments
are
no
less
than
scudi
derived
from
lands
and
houses
from
grants
and
from
the
papal
when
peter
entered
rome
for
the
first
time
and
looked
upon
the
miserable
condition
of
those
to
whom
the
favors
of
fortune
were
denied
he
recalled
to
mind
the
words
addressed
to
his
forefathers
about
to
enter
into
the
promised
land
shall
be
no
poor
nor
beggar
among
you
that
the
lord
thy
god
may
bless
thee
in
the
land
which
he
giveth
thee
to
deut
xv
and
saw
before
him
one
of
the
greatest
obstacles
to
be
overcome
involving
a
change
of
what
was
second
nature
to
the
romans
hardness
of
heart
they
being
as
paul
wrote
rom
i
affection
without
but
knowing
that
it
was
also
said
in
the
same
holy
text
will
not
be
wanting
in
the
land
therefore
i
command
thee
to
open
thy
hand
to
thy
needy
and
poor
brother
and
having
heard
the
blessed
lord
jesus
say
of
the
new
dispensation
poor
ye
have
always
with
you
he
understood
that
object
was
not
to
forbid
mendicity
but
to
leave
no
room
for
it
therefore
to
the
rich
and
powerful
when
brought
by
grace
to
his
apostolic
feet
he
enjoined
thy
bread
to
the
hungry
and
bring
the
needy
and
the
harborless
into
thy
isaias
lviii
the
faith
of
the
roman
christians
was
illustrious
throughout
the
world
and
so
was
their
charity
from
the
days
of
peter
it
had
been
customary
to
take
up
collections
on
sundays
in
all
the
congregations
of
the
city
for
the
relief
of
the
confessors
condemned
to
labor
in
the
public
mines
and
other
works
or
languishing
in
prison
or
wandering
in
exile
and
eusebius
has
preserved
in
his
lib
iv
cap
the
testimony
of
dionysius
bishop
of
corinth
in
favor
of
the
charitable
institutions
of
the
romans
and
in
praise
at
the
same
time
of
the
piety
of
his
contemporary
pope
soter
who
not
only
retained
these
customs
of
his
people
but
surpassed
them
in
sending
money
to
the
christians
of
other
parts
of
the
world
and
in
receiving
as
though
they
were
his
own
children
all
faithful
pilgrims
to
rome
in
the
year
pope
fabian
gave
charge
of
the
poor
of
rome
to
seven
deacons
each
of
whom
superintended
two
of
the
fourteen
civil
divisions
or
regions
whence
they
were
called
regionary
deacons
a
memorial
of
their
occupation
still
remains
in
the
dalmatic
or
vestment
the
wide
sleeves
of
which
served
originally
for
pockets
and
pope
innocent
in
his
treatise
on
the
mass
remarks
that
this
kind
of
dress
is
attributed
to
deacons
because
in
the
first
institution
of
their
order
the
distribution
of
alms
was
assigned
to
them
a
council
of
the
ivth
century
held
under
pope
sylvester
decreed
that
part
of
the
church
revenues
should
be
set
apart
for
the
poor
jerome
attests
in
one
of
his
letters
that
a
noble
matron
named
fabiola
erected
a
hospital
in
the
year
and
about
the
same
time
gallicanus
a
man
of
consular
dignity
who
had
also
been
honored
with
a
triumph
becoming
a
christian
founded
a
similar
institution
at
the
mouth
of
the
tiber
for
the
accommodation
of
pilgrims
and
of
the
sick
he
waited
upon
them
in
person
in
rome
had
a
population
of
about
inhabitants
and
although
the
climate
is
not
unhealthy
it
is
hardly
one
of
the
most
salubrious
in
the
world
the
low
land
upon
which
a
great
part
of
the
modern
city
is
built
the
turbid
tiber
which
passing
through
it
in
a
winding
course
is
apt
to
overflow
its
banks
the
open
position
of
the
city
which
is
exposed
according
to
the
season
either
to
the
sultry
african
wind
or
to
the
piercing
blasts
from
the
neighboring
mountains
and
the
large
floating
population
which
is
everywhere
a
likely
subject
of
disease
combine
to
make
it
desirable
that
rome
should
be
well
provided
with
institutions
of
succor
and
relief
while
under
papal
rule
she
was
not
wanting
in
this
respect
but
was
even
abundantly
and
excellently
supplied
man
being
composed
of
spirit
and
matter
having
consequently
a
soul
and
a
body
to
look
after
has
wants
of
two
kinds
corresponding
to
the
twofold
claims
of
his
nature
we
should
therefore
divide
the
charities
man
is
capable
of
receiving
into
two
classes
he
received
them
in
rome
with
a
generous
hand
the
first
class
comprehended
relief
to
the
indigent
the
sick
the
destitute
the
insane
the
convalescent
possessed
hospitals
and
asylums
brought
aid
into
private
families
opened
nocturnal
retreats
offered
work
to
the
honest
needy
gave
marriage
portions
to
the
nubile
shielded
widows
protected
orphans
advanced
money
on
the
easiest
terms
these
were
charities
of
subsistence
the
second
class
embraced
poor
schools
and
other
establishments
for
gratuitous
education
in
trades
arts
and
sciences
conservatories
for
the
exposed
hospices
for
the
reformed
and
made
provision
for
the
legal
defence
of
the
weak
these
were
called
charities
of
education
there
were
two
institutions
in
rome
that
assisted
the
poor
before
they
had
fallen
into
misery
or
become
destitute
these
were
the
di
and
the
the
first
was
a
bank
of
loan
and
deposit
the
idea
of
such
an
institution
was
suggested
by
a
pious
and
shrewd
franciscan
named
barnabas
of
terni
who
was
painfully
struck
during
a
mission
he
was
giving
in
perugia
in
the
year
by
the
enormous
usury
a
crime
then
practised
almost
exclusively
by
jews
which
the
poor
were
forced
to
pay
for
any
advance
of
money
they
might
need
this
practical
friar
prevailed
upon
several
wealthy
persons
to
mass
sums
of
money
into
one
fund
out
of
which
to
lend
to
the
poor
at
a
reasonable
and
in
some
cases
merely
nominal
rate
of
interest
hence
the
distinctive
name
of
monte
di
pietà
which
means
literally
mountain
of
mercy
the
roman
was
the
third
institution
of
the
sort
that
was
opened
this
was
in
the
year
it
was
to
lend
money
up
to
a
certain
amount
without
taking
interest
above
this
amount
for
a
very
small
interest
it
was
to
take
articles
on
pawn
and
give
the
appraised
value
less
over
used
under
the
papal
government
to
be
annually
loaned
out
on
pawns
or
otherwise
without
one
cent
of
interest
this
establishment
occupied
a
superb
public
building
and
was
under
the
control
of
the
minister
of
finance
honest
visitors
were
freely
admitted
into
every
part
of
it
and
we
have
heard
many
even
english
and
americans
express
themselves
surprised
if
not
satisfied
with
this
reasonable
and
conscientious
manner
of
saving
the
poor
from
the
gripe
of
usurers
and
while
imposing
enough
restraint
to
discourage
improvidence
no
hope
was
held
out
of
indiscriminate
relief
looking
at
the
in
an
antiquarian
light
it
was
a
perfect
museum
of
modern
life
and
to
go
through
it
was
as
good
as
visiting
a
hundred
consolidated
old
its
administration
employed
including
a
detachment
of
the
swiss
guard
one
hundred
persons
the
capital
which
consisted
of
every
kind
of
property
that
at
various
periods
and
from
many
benefactors
had
come
to
it
was
about
three
million
dollars
the
most
orthodox
political
economists
acknowledge
that
institutions
of
this
sort
were
devised
only
as
a
lesser
evil
and
consequently
the
roman
government
was
glad
to
see
the
business
of
the
fall
away
considerably
after
the
opening
of
the
in
this
was
a
charitable
institution
because
it
was
governed
gratuitously
by
an
administration
of
eleven
honest
and
intelligent
men
among
whom
were
some
of
the
first
nobility
who
thus
gave
a
portion
of
their
time
and
talents
to
the
poor
the
cashier
prince
borghese
gave
besides
his
services
a
part
of
his
magnificent
palace
to
be
turned
into
offices
for
the
business
transactions
of
the
bank
the
apostolic
almonry
in
the
vatican
next
claimed
our
attention
in
the
quiet
days
of
the
pope
from
the
earliest
period
the
vicars
of
christ
have
made
it
a
practice
to
visit
in
person
the
poor
and
distribute
alms
with
their
own
hands
in
love
and
imitation
of
him
who
about
doing
as
the
wealth
of
the
church
in
rome
increased
it
was
found
necessary
for
the
better
ordering
of
things
to
have
some
administrative
assistance
in
the
distribution
of
these
private
charities
conon
in
the
viith
century
employed
the
paschal
to
dispense
the
bounty
of
the
privy
purse
and
in
the
year
blessed
gregory
created
the
perpetual
office
of
grand
almoner
in
the
papal
court
this
officer
is
always
an
archbishop
and
lives
under
the
same
roof
as
the
holy
father
in
order
to
be
ready
at
all
times
to
receive
his
commands
besides
the
many
standing
largitions
issued
from
the
grand
almonry
there
were
occasional
ones
such
as
the
largess
of
which
was
distributed
in
the
great
of
belvidere
on
each
anniversary
of
the
coronation
this
sum
was
doubled
the
first
year
on
each
of
the
following
civil
or
religious
festivals
christmas
easter
and
coronation
day
were
divided
among
a
certain
number
of
the
prisoners
confined
in
rome
about
a
month
were
paid
out
either
at
the
word
of
the
sovereign
or
on
his
order
while
a
sum
of
was
annually
divided
among
one
hundred
poor
families
besides
this
the
grand
almonry
supported
a
number
of
free
schools
dispensed
food
and
medicines
and
performed
many
acts
of
more
secret
charity
a
memorial
of
the
earlier
personal
distribution
of
alms
by
the
popes
is
retained
in
the
which
they
wear
in
solemn
pontificals
it
is
an
ornament
of
silk
of
the
color
of
the
feast
fringed
with
gold
and
suspended
down
the
left
side
from
the
girdle

friday
the
succinctory

not

execration
of
the
evil
use
judas
iscariot
made
of
the
purse
when
he
betrayed
our
lord
for
thirty
pieces
of
silver
another
of
the
great
charities
of
rome
was
the
commission
of
subsidies
established
by
pope
leo
in
to
give
assistance
and
employment
to
poor
but
honest
people
willing
to
help
themselves
if
they
could
find
the
opportunity
the
whole
tendency
of
roman
charities
under
the
popes
was
to
frown
upon
sloth
and
vagrancy
and
encourage
and
mutual
support
for
paul
wrote
to
the
thessalonians
iii
any
man
will
not
work
neither
let
him
the
commission
received
a
yearly
subsidy
from
government
of
in
each
of
the
fourteen
rioni
or
wards
of
the
city
a
physician
surgeon
pharmacist
and
midwife
rendered
gratuitous
services
under
its
control
it
was
by
the
judicious
employment
of
such
men
thrown
on
the
hands
of
the
commission
that
within
the
last
thirty
years
so
much
was
done
in
making
excavations
in
and
about
rome
in
search
of
antiquities
and
in
studying
its
ancient
topography
we
have
sometimes
heard
english
and
american
make
brutal
remarks
about
dirty
lazy
romans
as
they
would
stop
a
moment
to
look
at
some
party
of
these
poor
fellows
taking
their
work
so
easily
in
the
forum
on
the
palatine
or
elsewhere
but
we
should
rather
applaud
the
paternal
government
that
refrained
from
calling
poverty
a
crime
or
driving
the
poor
and
weak
to
their
work
like
and
while
contributing
a
generous
support
gave
them
enough
to
do
to
save
their
no
such
thing
as
in
the
english
sense
have
ever
been
maintained
where
catholic
influences
have
predominated
and
for
this
we
may
thank
god
another
category
of
roman
charities
comprised
the
confraternities
these
associations
for
purposes
of
piety
and
mutual
help
convey
in
their
name
the
idea
of
brotherliness
and
union
there
were
no
fewer
than
confraternities
in
rome
under
the
popes
the
oldest
and
most
famous
of
these
was
the
annunciation
which
was
founded
in
by
the
dominican
cardinal
john
torquemada
in
santa
the
head
church
of
his
order
in
rome
its
particular
object
was
to
give
portions
to
poor
but
virtuous
young
females
that
they
might
either
marry
or
enter
a
religious
house
if
they
had
a
vocation
on
the
of
march
the
pope
cardinals
and
prelates
with
the
rest
of
the
court
used
to
assist
at
mass
in
that
church
and
preside
at
the
distribution
of
dowers
which
followed
immediately
the
girls
were
always
dressed
in
plain
white
such
as
had
signified
their
choice
of
the
heavenly
spouse
being
distinguished
by
a
wreath
on
the
head
on
this
occasion
the
pontiff
gave
one
hundred
golden
scudi
and
each
cardinal
present
gave
one
to
the
funds
of
the
confraternity
there
were
fourteen
other
confraternities
that
had
the
same
object
although
carried
out
with
less
solemnity
in
this
way
used
to
be
expended
annually
the
confraternity
of
the
twelve
apostles
made
it
a
special
point
to
find
out
and
relieve
in
a
delicate
manner
those
who
having
known
better
days
were
fallen
into
reduced
circumstances
the
confraternity
of
prayer
and
death
buried
the
dead
and
if
an
accident
in
or
about
rome
was
reported
in
which
life
was
lost
a
party
was
detailed
to
go
and
bring
the
body
in
decently
for
christian
burial
sometimes
a
poor
herdsman
on
the
campagna
had
been
gored
by
an
ox
or
some
fellow
had
been
swept
away
and
drowned
in
the
tiber
or
perhaps
a
reaper
been
prostrated
by
the
heat
at
whatever
hour
of
the
day
or
night
and
at
all
seasons
a
band
of
this
confraternity
went
out
and
returned
carrying
the
unfortunate
person
on
a
stretcher
upon
their
shoulders
it
must
be
remarked
in
this
connection
that
the
members
of
the
confraternity
always
observed
the
laws
concerning
deaths
of
this
kind
not
interfering
with
but
merely
placing
themselves
at
the
disposal
of
the
officers
of
justice
to
give
a
body
burial
at
their
own
expense
and
in
consecrated
ground
the
confraternity
of
pity
for
prisoners
was
founded
in
by
father
john
tallier
a
french
jesuit
it
provided
religious
instruction
for
prisoners
distributed
objects
of
piety
among
them
looked
after
their
families
if
destitute
and
assisted
them
to
pay
their
debts
and
fines
if
they
had
any
the
confraternity
of
john
baptist
was
composed
exclusively
of
florentines
and
the
descendants
of
florentines
its
object
was
to
comfort
and
assist
to
the
last
criminals
condemned
to
death
as
decapitation
was
the
mode
of
judicial
punishment
john
baptist
who
was
slain
by
herod
was
their
patron
and
his
head
on
a
charger
the
arms
of
the
confraternity
although
there
were
so
many
confraternities
and
other
pious
associations
in
rome
connected
by
their
object
with
institutions
of
every
kind
sanitary
corrective
they
were
very
careful
never
to
interfere
with
the
regulations
of
such
establishments
and
consequently
by
minding
their
own
business
they
were
not
in
the
way
of
the
officials
but
on
the
contrary
were
looked
upon
as
valuable
assistants
the
society
of
vincent
of
paul
was
started
in
rome
in
by
the
late
venerable
father
de
ravignan
it
counted
conferences
and
one
thousand
active
members
clergy
and
laymen
titled
folks
and
all
working
harmoniously
together
about
was
annually
dispensed
by
the
society
the
congregation
of
ladies
was
founded
in
by
monsignor
now
cardinal
borromeo
to
give
work
especially
to
young
women
out
of
employment
a
great
many
ecclesiastical
vestments
were
thus
made
under
the
direction
of
the
ladies
and
either
sent
as
presents
to
poor
missions
or
sold
for
what
they
would
bring
at
the
annual
fair
held
for
the
purpose
of
disposing
of
them
there
were
seven
public
hospitals
in
rome
under
the
immediate
direction
of
a
general
board
of
administration
composed
of
twelve
members
of
whom
three
belonged
to
the
clergy
and
the
rest
to
the
laity
the
oldest
largest
and
institution
of
this
kind
was
santo
spirito
situated
in
the
leonine
quarter
of
the
city
on
the
border
of
the
tiber
its
site
has
been
occupied
by
a
charitable
institution
ever
since
the
earliest
building
having
been
founded
there
for
his
countrymen
by
ina
king
of
wessex
for
this
reason
the
whole
pile
of
buildings
is
called
santo
spirito
in
the
quarter
of
the
west
saxons
there
are
three
distinct
establishments
under
the
administration
of
santo
spirito
the
hospital
itself
the
foundling
hospital
and
the
lunatic
asylum
the
first
was
founded
by
pope
innocent
iii
in
the
saxons
having
abandoned
this
locality
for
a
more
central
position
the
present
it
has
received
since
then
many
additions
until
it
has
assumed
the
enormous
proportions
that
we
now
admire
every
improvement
was
made
to
keep
pace
with
the
advance
of
hygienic
knowledge
this
hospital
was
for
men
only
it
had
beds
and
an
annual
average
of
patients
the
wards
were
twelve
in
number
in
which
the
cleanliness
was
refreshing
the
ventilation
excellent
and
the
pure
and
abundant
the
principal
parts
of
the
exterior
and
some
of
the
interior
parts
of
the
building
were
by
distinguished
architects
while
some
of
the
wards
had
their
ceilings
and
upper
walls
painted
in
fresco
with
scenes
from
sacred
scripture
such
as
the
sufferings
of
job
and
the
miraculous
cures
made
by
our
lord
not
only
the
eye
but
the
ear
too
of
the
poor
patients
was
pleased
for
three
times
a
week
they
were
entertained
with
organ
music
from
a
lofty
choir
erected
at
one
end
of
the
largest
wards
the
spiritual
care
of
the
sick
was
perfect
it
was
impossible
for
any
one
to
die
without
the
rites
of
the
church
in
the
centre
of
every
ward
there
was
a
fixed
altar
upon
which
mass
was
said
daily
the
confraternity
of
santo
spirito
composed
of
clergy
and
laymen
assisted
the
regular
ministers
of
religion
in
attendance

and
night
these
volunteers
brought

to
the

and
other
sacraments
and
disposed
them
to
die
a
good
death
besides
performing
for
them
the
most
menial
services
we
remember
to
have
read
a
letter
addressed
to
the
new
york
by
an
eminent
protestant
clergyman
of
new
york
in
which
after
describing
this
institution
then
under
papal
rule
he
said
that
he
could
not
speak
too
highly
of
the
excellent
attendance
the
patients
received
from
the
religious
who
were
stationed
there
and
added
that
if
ever
he
had
to
come
to
a
hospital
he
hoped
it
would
be
santo
spirito
the
foundling
hospital
was
opened
by
pope
innocent
iii
and
the
lunatic
asylum
for
both
sexes
was
founded
in
by
three
spaniards
a
priest
and
two
laymen
it
was
called
the
house
of
our
lady
of
mercy
a
fine
garden
on
the
janiculum
hill
was
attached
to
it
for
the
recreation
of
the
patients
we
do
not
know
how
it
is
conducted
since
it
has
changed
hands
but
formerly
it
was
managed
on
the
system
of
kindness
towards
even
the
fiercest
madmen
using
only
so
much
restraint
as
was
positively
necessary
it
was
then
under
the
care
of
religious
the
hospital
of
the
santissimo
salvatore
near
john
of
lateran
was
founded
in
by
a
cardinal
colonna
it
was
for
women
only
another
cardinal
colonna
founded
the
hospital
of
james
for
incurables
in
our
lady
of
consolation
was
a
fine
hospital
near
the
forum
for
the
maimed
and
wounded
while
san
gallicano
on
the
other
side
of
the
river
was
for
fevers
and
san
rocco
was
a
small
hospital
with
accommodation
for
women
it
was
founded
at
the
beginning
of
the
xviith
century
by
a
cardinal
salviati
the
most
delicate
precautions
were
always
used
there
to
save
any
sense
of
honor
that
might
still
cling
to
a
victim
of
frailty
guilt
could
at
least
blush
unnoticed
the
santissima
trinità
was
founded
by
philip
neri
for
convalescents
of
both
sexes
and
for
poor
pilgrims
it
could
lodge
patients
had
beds
for
pilgrims
and
for
in
the
great
refectory
of
this
building
the
members
of
the
confraternity
came
on
every
holy
thursday
evening
to
wash
the
feet
of
the
pilgrims
and
wait
on
them
at
table
of
course
the
two
sexes
were
in
different
parts
of
the
building
and
each
was
attended
by
its
own
we
remember
the
delightful
ardor
with
which
the
late
cardinal
barnabo
on
such
occasions
would
turn
up
his
sleeves
twitch
his
apron
and
going
down
on
his
knees
give
some
poor
feet
a
better
washing
than
they
had
had
before
in
a
year
there
was
much
raising
of
in
that
wooden
tub
and
a
real
earnest
kiss
on
one
foot
when
the
washing
was
over
the
hospital
of
john
calabyta
was
so
called
from
a
spaniard
the
founder
of
the
brothers
of
charity
commonly
called
the
who
attended
it
it
was
opened
in
on
the
island
of
the
tiber
and
by
a
coincidence
then
perhaps
unknown
but
since
fully
brought
to
light
it
stood
on
the
very
site
of
an
which
the
priests
of
esculapius
kept
near
their
temple
two
thousand
years
ago
the
hospital
of
santa
galla
was
founded
in
by
the
princely
odescalchi
family
it
gave
a
night
asylum
to
homeless
men
there
were
beds
distributed
through
nine
dormitories
another
night
refuge
called
aloysius
was
founded
about
the
year
by
father
galluzzi
a
florentine
jesuit
it
is
for
women
we
can
get
some
idea
of
the
great
charity
such
refuges
are
when
we
know
that
during
the
year
ending
december
no
less
than
persons
sought
a
at
night
in
the
of
new
york
besides
these
public
hospitals
almost
every
catholic
country
had
a
private
national
one
one
of
the
picturesque
and
not
least
of
the
roman
charities
used
to
be
the
daily
distribution
of
food
at
the
gates
of
monasteries
convents
and
nunneries
the
portals
of
palaces
and
the
doors
of
seminaries
colleges
and
with
all
this
liberality
there
was
still
some
room
for
there
used
to
be
beggars
in
rome
assassins
have
taken
their
place
under
the
papal
government
a
limit
was
put
to
beggary
and
we
have
never
seen
the
beggar
who
figures
so
maliciously
in
some
protestant
books
about
rome
beggary
may
become
an
evil
it
is
not
a
crime
we
confess
to
liking
beggars
if
they
are
not
too
numerous
and
importunate
few
scenes
have
seemed
to
us
more
venerable
picturesque
and
christian
than
the
double
row
of
beggars
with
their
sores
and
crippled
limbs
their
sticks
and
battered
hats
and
outstretched
hands
imploring
è
amore
di
as
we
pass
between
them
to
the
church
or
cemetery
or
other
holy
place
on
afternoons
in
rome
the
hospice
of
san
michele
was
founded
in
by
a
cardinal
odescalchi
in
this
asylum
nearly
persons
used
to
be
received
they
were
divided
into
four
classes
old
men
old
women
boys
and
girls
the
institution
had
an
annual
endowment
of
but
some
years
ago
the
aged
of
both
sexes
were
removed
elsewhere
and
their
part
of
the
building
was
converted
into
a
house
of
correction
for
women
and
juvenile
offenders
the
hospice
in
its
strict
sense
now
consists
of
a
house
of
industry
for
children
of
both
sexes
and
a
gratuitous
school
of
the
industrial
and
fine
arts
the
carping
author
of
although
he
acknowledges
that
this
school
of
arts
has
produced
some
eminent
men
says
that
education
of
the
boys
might
be
turned
perhaps
to
more
practically
useful
objects
as
if
forsooth
it
were
a
lesser
charity
in
the
great
home
of
the
arts
that
rome
is
to
help
a
poor
lad
of
talent
to
become
an
architect
for
instance
than
to
make
him
a
tailor
the
orphan
asylum
of
saint
mary
of
the
angels
was
near
the
baths
of
diocletian
the
boys
numbered
under
the
care
of
male
religious
and
the
girls
under
that
of
female
religious
the
institution
received
annually
from
the
commission
of
subsidies
in
the
same
quarter
of
the
city
is
the
deaf
and
dumb
asylum
it
was
opened
in
by
father
silvestri
who
had
been
sent
to
paris
by
pope
pius
vi
to
receive
instruction
from
the
celebrated
abbé
de
in
the
art
of
teaching
this
class
of
unfortunates
visitors
to
the
house
are
made
welcome
and
are
often
invited
to
test
the
knowledge
of
the
pupils
by
asking
them
questions
on
the
blackboard
the
first
time
we
called
there
was
in
and
having
asked
one
of
the
boys
taken
at
hazard
who
was
the
first
president
of
the
united
states
we
were
a
little
surprised
having
thought
to
puzzle
him
to
have
the
correct
answer
at
once
the
house
of
converts
was
an
establishment
where
persons
who
wished
to
become
catholics
were
received
for
a
time
and
instructed
in
the
faith
it
was
founded
in
by
a
priest
of
the
oratory
other
interesting
hospices
were
the
home
and
the
house
for
aged
priests
where
the
veterans
of
the
roman
clergy
could
end
their
days
in
honorable
comfort
a
peculiar
class
of
roman
charities
were
the
conservatories
they
were
in
number
some
of
them
were
for
penance
others
for
change
of
life
and
others
again
to
shield
unprotected
virtue
the
infant
asylum
was
a
flourishing
institution
directed
by
female
religious
even
fashion
was
made
to
do
something
for
it
since
a
noble
lady
years
ago
suggested
that
the
members
of
good
society
in
rome
should
dispense
with
their
mutual
new
year
visits
on
condition
of
giving
three
pauls
a
small
sum
of
money
to
the
asylum
and
having
their
names
published
in
the
official
journal
the
society
for
the
propagation
of
the
faith
was
established
at
rome
in
no
city
of
the
size
and
population
of
rome
was
better
supplied
with
free
schools
of
every
description
the
were
first
opened
in
in
connection
with
studies
we
should
mention
the
liberal
presents
of
books
vestments
and
liturgical
articles
made
to
young
missionaries
by
the
propaganda
and
the
books
on
learned
subjects
which
being
printed
at
government
expense
were
sold
at
a
reduced
price
to
students
of
every
nation
on
showing
a
certificate
from
one
of
their
professors
it
is
written
matthew
iv
liveth
not
by
bread
and
consequently
rome
multiplied
those
pious
houses
of
retreat
in
which
the
soul
could
rest
for
a
time
from
the
cares
of
life
there
were
five
such
establishments
in
the
city
another
great
roman
charity
was
the
missions
preached
by
the
jesuits
and
franciscans
in
and
around
the
city
thus
bringing
the
truths
of
the
gospel
constantly
before
the
people
we
have
given
but
a
brief
sketch
of
our
subject
it
has
been
treated
in
a
complete
manner
by
cardinal
morichini
in
a
new
and
revised
edition
of
his
interesting
work
entitled
istituti
di
pubblica
carità
ed
istruzione
primaria
e
delle
prigioni
in
song
i
when
in
the
long
and
lonely
night
that
brings
no
slumber
to
mine
eyes
through
dark
returns
the
vision
bright
the
face
and
form
that
day
denies
and
like
a
solitary
star
revealed
above
a
stormy
sea
thy
spirit
soothes
me
from
afar
i
mourn
thee
not
nor
weep
for
thee
ii
and
when
i
watch
the
dawn
afar
awake
her
sleeping
sister
night
and
overhead
the
dying
star
return
into
her
parent
light
and
in
the
breaking
day
discern
the
glimmer
of
eternity
the
goal
the
peace
for
which
i
yearn
i
mourn
thee
not
nor
weep
for
thee
iii
and
when
the
melancholy
eve
brings
back
the
hour
akin
to
tears
and
through
the
twilight
i
perceive
the
settled
strong
abiding
spheres
and
gently
on
my
heart
opprest
like
dew
descending
silently
there
falls
a
portion
of
thy
rest
i
mourn
thee
not
nor
weep
for
thee
iv
but
when
once
more
the
stir
of
life
makes
all
these
busy
highways
loud
and
fretted
by
the
jarring
strife
the
noisy
humors
of
the
crowd
the
subtle
sweet
suggestions
born
of
silence
fail
and
memory
consoles
no
more
i
mourn
i
mourn
that
thou
art
not
and
weep
for
thee
progress
grooves
do
you
like
your
new
minister
mrs
much
indeed
he
is
progressive
is
not
fixed
in
any
of
the
old
grooves
his
mind
does
not
run
in
those
ancient
ruts
that
forbid
advance
and
baffle
modern
how
strangely
this
colloquy
between
a
methodist
and
congregationalist
fell
upon
the
catholic
ear
of
their
mutual
friend
comment
however
was
discreetly
forborne
that
friend
had
learned
in
the
very
infancy
of
a
catholic
life
beginning
at
the
mature
age
of
by
the
register
the
futility
of
controversy
and
that
the
pearls
of
truth
are
too
precious
to
be
carelessly
thrown
away
strangely
enough
these
expressions
affected
one
whose
habits
of
thought
and
conduct
had
been
silently
forming
in
accordance
with
that
life
for
years
indeed
lucifer
found
them
utterly
irreconcilable
with
his
in
heaven
confessedly
the
success
of
his
progressive
enterprise
was
not
encouraging
but
the
battle
and
its
results
established
his
unquestionable
claim
as
captain
and
leader
of
the
sons
and
daughters
of
progress
for
all
time
thought
so
far
as
we
can
discover
the
best
it
has
done
for
its
disciples
is
to
prove
to
them
beyond
a
doubt
that
their
dear
grandpapa
of
eld
was
an
ape
and
that
they
when
they
shake
off
this
mortal
coil
will
be
gathered
to
their
ancestors
in
common
with
their
brethren
the
modern
monkeys
we
who
believe
the
authentic
history
of
the
past
can
see
in
this
boasted
new
railroad
upon
which
the
freight
of
modern
science
and
advanced
civilization
is
borne
a
pathway
as
old
as
the
time
when
our
dear
credulous
old
grandmamma
received
a
morning
call
in
eden
from
the
oldest
brother
of
these
scientific
gentlemen
who
convinced
her
in
the
course
of
their
pleasant
chat
that
poor
deluded
adam
and
herself
were
fastened
in
the
most
irrational
rut
a
perfect
outrage
upon
common
sense
and
that
a
very
slight
repast
upon
would
lift
them
out
of
it
emancipate
thought
and
make
them
as
knowing
good
and
we
all
know
how
well
they
succeeded
in
their
first
step
on
the
highway
of
progress
they
lost
a
beautiful
garden
it
is
true
of
limited
dimensions
but
they
gained
a
world
of
boundless
space
and
a
freedom
of
thought
and
action
which
was
first
successfully
and
completely
illustrated
by
their
son
when
he
murmured
and
killed
his
brother
who
was
evidently
attached
to
grooves
they
left
the
heritage
thus
gained
to
a
large
proportion
of
their
descendants
a
minority
of
them
it
is
true
prefer
to
out
the
old
of
obedience
to
the
commands
of
god
walk
to
shun
the
along
which
modern
civilization
is
rolling
its
countless
throngs
and
to
in
at
the
strait
which
leadeth
to
life
eternal
to
the
great
disgust
of
the
disciples
of
modern
thought
who
spare
no
effort
to
prove
their
exceeding
liberality
by
persecuting
such
with
derision
calumny
chains
imprisonment
and
death
thank
god
this
is
all
they
can
do
rage
they
never
so
furiously
he
that
sitteth
in
the
heavens
laughs
them
to
scorn
he
will
defend
and
preserve
his
anointed
against
all
the
combined
hosts
of
bismarcks
kaisers
and
robber
princes
who
illustrate
the
liberal
ideas
that
govern
the
march
of
modern
civilization
traces
of
an
indian
legend
it
has
been
said
of
our
energetic
republic
that
it
had
no
infancy
that
it
sprang
into
a
vigorous
and
complete
existence
at
a
bound
however
true
this
may
be
with
respect
to
its
material
structure
in
the
hands
of
the
remarkable
men
who
first
planted
colonies
on
american
soil
there
is
another
view
of
the
picture
which
presents
widely
different
features
to
the
eye
of
the
christian
philosopher
the
religious
and
moral
aspects
of
our
country
to
this
day
afford
subjects
for
anything
but
satisfactory
reflection
the
pioneers
of
civilization
along
the
northeastern
borders
of
our
territory
were
whatever
their
professions
to
the
contrary
may
have
been
worshippers
of
material
prosperity
the
worship
of
god
and
the
claims
of
religion
were
indeed
important
and
proper
in
their
place
for
a
portion
of
the
seventh
part
of
each
week
but
the
moment
they
came
in
conflict
with
mammon
there
was
little
question
which
should
yield
it
was
not
to
be
expected
that
the
saints
whom
the
lord
had
specially
chosen
and
unto
whom
had
given
the
earth
should
be
diverted
from
their
pursuit
of
the
great
by
precepts
which
were
applicable
only
to
ordinary
and
less
favored
mortals
whatever
progress
the
church
has
yet
achieved
in
this
region
is
the
result
of
appalling
labors
and
sacrifices
the
foundation
was
laid
in
sufferings
fatigues
and
perils
from
the
contemplation
of
which
the
christians
of
our
day
would
shrink
aghast
laid
long
before
the
pilgrim
fathers
landed
at
plymouth
while
the
savage
still
roamed
through
the
unbroken
forests
of
new
england
and
disputed
dominion
with
wild
beasts
hardly
more
dangerous
than
himself
to
the
messengers
of
the
gospel
of
peace
amid
the
wonderful
beauty
and
variety
of
the
panorama
which
her
mountains
lakes
and
valleys
unfold
to
the
tourists
and
of
there
is
scarcely
a
scene
that
has
not
been
traversed
in
weariness
in
hunger
and
cold
by
those
dauntless
servants
of
god
who
first
proclaimed
the
tidings
of
salvation
to
the
wild
children
of
the
forest
futile
and
even
foolish
as
the
toils
of
these
early
fathers
may
appear
to
the
materialist
and
utilitarian
of
this
day
because
of
their
tardy
and
apparently
inadequate
fruits
the
designs
of
heaven
have
not
been
frustrated
and
its
light
reveals
a
very
different
history
we
read
therein
how
he
who
causes
weak
and
foolish
things
of
this
world
to
confound
the
and
to
proclaim
his
praise
sent
his
ministering
angels
to
hover
over
the
pathway
moistened
with
the
tears
and
blood
of
his
servants
to
note
each
footprint
through
the
dreary
wilderness
to
gather
the
incense
of
each
prayer
and
to
mark
each
pain
and
peril
of
their
sacrificial
march
for
record
in
the
archives
of
eternity
as
an
earnest
for
future
good
to
those
regions
and
as
enduring
testimony
before
the
high
court
of
heaven
to
their
fitness
for
the
crown
far
surpassing
in
glory
all
earthly
crowns
which
they
won
by
their
burning
zeal
and
unwavering
patience
nor
were
their
efforts
in
the
field
of
their
earthly
labors
so
vain
as
some
of
our
modern
historians
would
have
us
suppose
prayer
and
exertion
in
the
service
of
god
are
never
fruitless
if
it
is
true
as
the
great
champlain
was
wont
to
say
one
soul
gained
for
heaven
was
of
more
value
than
the
conquest
of
an
empire
for
france
they
gained
from
the
roving
tribes
of
the
desert
many
sincere
and
steadfast
adherents
to
the
faith
whose
names
are
recorded
in
the
book
of
life
and
scattered
benedictions
along
their
painful
pathway
which
have
shed
their
beneficent
influences
over
the
scenes
they
traversed
down
to
the
present
day
we
hope
to
illustrate
and
sustain
this
assertion
in
the
following
sketch
drawn
from
our
memory
of
traditions
preserved
among
the
indians
of
regis
to
which
we
listened
many
years
ago
scattered
along
the
southern
shores
of
the
lawrence
from
the
foot
of
lake
ontario
to
the
village
of
regis
while
lawrence
county
was
yet
for
the
most
part
covered
with
primitive
forests
were
many
encampments
of
these
indians
that
whole
region
abounded
in
game
and
furnished
favorite
to
which
they
claimed
a
right
in
connection
with
their
special
reservation
in
the
more
immediate
neighborhood
of
regis
at
each
of
these
encampments
an
aged
indian
was
sure
to
be
found
who
without
the
title
of
chief
was
a
kind
of
patriarch
among
his
younger
brethren
exercised
great
influence
in
their
affairs
and
was
treated
with
profound
respect
by
them
he
was
their
umpire
in
all
disputes
their
adviser
in
doubtful
matters
and
the
of
in
his
lodge
always
the
largest
and
most
commodious
of
the
wigwams
and
the
one
in
which
they
assembled
for
their
devotions
one
of
the
oldest
of
these
sages
called
must
have
been
much
more
than
a
hundred
years
of
age
judging
from
the
dates
of
events
of
which
he
retained
a
distinct
remembrance
as
an
and
which
occurred
in
the
course
of
the
french
and
indian
wars
over
a
century
previous
to
the
time
when
we
listened
to
his
recital
his
head
was
an
inexhaustible
of
traditions
and
legends
many
of
them
relating
to
the
discovery
and
settlement
of
canada
and
the
labors
of
the
first
missionaries
he
was
very
fond
of
young
people
and
gathering
the
children
of
the
white
settlers
around
him
he
would
hold
them
for
hours
while
he
related
stories
of
those
early
days
in
his
peculiarly
impressive
and
figurative
language
he
claimed
that
his
grandfather
was
one
of
the
party
who
accompanied
champlain
on
his
first
voyage
through
the
lake
which
bears
his
name
and
that
he
afterwards
acted
as
guide
and
interpreter
to
the
first
priest
who
visited
the
valley
of
lake
champlain
when
he
heard
that
we
were
from
vermont
he
asked
for
a
piece
of
chalk
and
marking
on
the
floor
an
outline
of
the
lake
and
the
course
of
the
richelieu
river
he
proceeded
to
narrate
the
voyage
of
champlain
and
his
party
in
the
summer
of
embosomed
within
the
placid
waters
of
lake
champlain
near
its
northern
extremity
is
a
lovely
island
of
which
vermonters
boast
as
the
of
the
lake
so
remarkable
is
it
for
beauty
and
fertility
here
the
party
landed
and
champlain
erecting
a
cross
claimed
the
lake
to
which
he
gave
his
own
name
its
islands
and
shores
for
france
and
for
christianity
half
a
century
later
one
la
motte
built
a
fort
upon
this
island
which
he
named
anne
giving
the
island
his
own
name
and
it
is
called
the
isle
la
motte
to
this
day
champlain
explored
the
lake
as
far
as
crown
point
where
they
encountered
and
defeated
a
band
of
iroquois
indians
but
not
deeming
it
wise
to
adventure
further
at
that
time
so
near
such
powerful
foes
they
returned
down
the
lake
without
delay
this
encounter
was
the
first
act
of
that
savage
drama
which
so
long
desolated
new
france
and
threatened
it
with
entire
destruction
six
years
later
in
the
summer
of
another
party
landed
on
the
isle
la
motte
it
was
made
up
of
a
missionary
of
the
recollect
order
and
his
escort
of
indians
in
two
bark
canoes
the
grandfather
of
our
narrator
was
one
of
these
they
remained
a
day
or
two
on
the
island
and
the
missionary
offered
the
christian
sacrifice
for
the
first
time
within
the
territory
now
embraced
by
the
state
of
vermont
the
object
of
his
journey
was
to
visit
scattered
bands
of
hunters
who
were
encamped
along
the
eastern
shore
of
the
lake
and
its
vicinity
at
different
points
in
the
valley
of
lake
champlain
leaving
the
isle
la
motte
they
steered
for
the
mouth
of
the
missisque
river
which
they
navigated
up
to
the
first
falls
where
the
village
of
swanton
now
stands
here
they
found
a
flourishing
encampment
and
remained
some
days
for
the
purpose
of
instructing
the
indians
in
the
truths
of
christianity
the
missionary
found
that
some
dim
reports
of
the
christian
teachers
had
preceded
him
and
prepared
the
way
for
his
work
the
success
of
which
encouraged
and
consoled
him
from
that
place
they
proceeded
on
foot
for
some
miles
to
the
base
of
a
line
of
hills
sketched
by
the
narrator
and
corresponding
to
those
east
of
here
they
also
remained
several
days
the
reverend
father
toiling
early
and
late
in
the
duties
of
his
vocation
he
was
now
surrounded
by
a
crowd
of
eager
listeners
for
not
only
did
his
former
audience
accompany
him
but
a
goodly
number
from
the
surrounding
hills
and
from
bellamaqueau
and
maquam
bays
distant
three
and
five
miles
respectively
flocked
to
hear
his
instructions
and
to
be
taught
revealed
to
them
by
the
great
spirit
through
his
servant
here
they
brought
to
him
also
the
beautiful
indian
maiden
of
whom
her
race
cherish
the
legend
that
her
declining
health
led
her
people
to
bring
her
to
these
hills
hoping
the
change
from
the
low
lands
and
damp
atmosphere
of
her
home
to
the
bracing
mountain
air
might
prove
beneficial
instead
of
finding
relief
she
only
declined
the
more
rapidly
so
that
she
was
soon
unable
to
be
carried
back
she
too
had
heard
whispers
of
holy
men
who
had
come
to
teach
her
race
the
path
of
heaven
and
wistfully
she
had
sighed
daily
as
she
repeated
the
yearning
aspiration
if
the
great
spirit
would
but
let
me
see
and
listen
to
his
messenger
i
could
die
in
peace
the
indians
to
this
day
tell
with
what
joy
she
listened
to
his
words
how
eagerly
she
prayed
that
she
might
receive
the
regenerating
waters
how
when
they
were
poured
upon
her
head
her
countenance
became
bright
with
the
light
of
heaven
and
how
her
departure
soon
after
was
full
of
joy
and
peace
her
was
made
on
one
of
those
eastern
hills
it
was
the
first
christian
burial
for
one
of
her
race
in
vermont
and
her
people
thought
her
intercessions
would
not
fail
to
bring
down
blessings
upon
all
that
region
pursuing
their
journey
by
the
trail
of
those
who
had
preceded
them
through
the
dense
wilderness
for
our
aborigines
were
skilled
in
tracing
lines
of
communication
between
their
different
camps
with
extreme
directness
by
aid
of
their
close
observations
of
nature
the
party
arrived
at
another
camp
on
the
bank
of
a
river
discovered
by
champlain
and
named
by
him
the
lamoille
at
this
place
an
indian
youth
came
to
the
missionary
in
great
distress
his
young
squaw
was
lying
at
the
point
of
death
and
the
medicine
men
and
women
could
do
nothing
more
for
her
would
not
restore
her
oh
if
it
would
give
her
back
to
him
he
with
all
his
family
would
gratefully
embrace
it
the
reverend
father
went
to
her
and
when
he
found
she
desired
it
baptized
her
and
her
infant
in
preparation
for
the
death
which
seemed
inevitable
contrary
to
all
expectation
she
recovered
her
husband
and
his
family
together
with
her
family
afterwards
became
joyful
believers
after
some
days
the
indians
of
that
place
accompanied
the
party
in
canoes
to
the
lake
and
along
its
shores
to
the
mouth
of
the
winooski
river
which
they
ascended
as
far
as
the
first
falls
here
they
remained
many
days
during
which
time
the
missionary
visited
the
present
site
of
burlington
and
held
two
missions
there
one
at
a
camp
on
the
summit
of
a
hill
overlooking
the
valley
of
the
winooski
as
it
approaches
the
lake
and
one
near
the
lake
shore
if
vermonters
who
are
familiar
with
the
magnificent
scenery
which
surrounds
the
of
their
state
never
visit
the
place
without
being
filled
with
new
admiration
at
the
infinite
variety
and
beauty
of
the
pictures
it
unfolds
from
every
changing
point
of
view
we
may
imagine
how
strangers
must
be
impressed
who
gaze
upon
them
for
the
first
time
not
less
picturesque
and
if
possible
even
more
striking
were
its
features
when
crowned
by
luxuriant
native
forests
and
fanned
by
gentle
breezes
from
the
lake
it
reposed
within
the
embrace
of
that
glorious
amphitheatre
of
hills
in
the
undisturbed
tranquillity
of
nature
it
was
not
strange
that
the
natives
were
drawn
by
its
unparalleled
attractions
to
congregate
there
in
such
numbers
as
to
require
from
their
reverend
visitor
a
longer
time
than
he
gave
to
any
other
place
in
this
series
of
missions
in
the
course
of
three
months
the
party
had
traversed
the
eastern
border
of
the
lake
to
the
last
encampment
near
its
southern
extremity
this
was
merely
a
summer
camp
as
the
vicinity
of
the
iroquois
made
it
unsafe
to
remain
there
longer
than
through
that
portion
of
the
season
when
the
mohawks
and
their
confederates
were
too
busy
with
their
own
pursuits
among
the
hills
of
the
adirondacks
to
give
much
heed
to
their
neighbors
at
the
close
of
the
mission
this
camp
was
broken
up
for
that
season
and
its
occupants
joined
the
reverend
father
and
his
party
in
canoes
as
far
as
the
mouth
of
the
winooski
river
whence
men
were
sent
to
convey
them
to
the
at
swanton
where
their
own
canoes
were
left
on
their
way
thither
they
lingered
for
some
days
on
grand
isle
then
as
now
a
vision
of
loveliness
to
all
admirers
of
the
beautiful
and
a
favorite
annual
resort
of
the
natives
for
the
period
during
which
they
were
safe
from
the
attacks
of
their
merciless
foes
at
every
mission
thus
opened
the
missionary
promised
to
return
himself
or
send
one
of
his
associates
to
renew
his
instructions
and
minister
to
the
spiritual
wants
of
his
converts
this
promise
was
fulfilled
as
far
as
the
limited
number
of
laborers
in
this
vineyard
permitted
the
brave
and
untiring
sons
of
loyola
afterwards
entered
the
field
and
proved
worthy
successors
of
the
zealous
recollects
who
first
announced
the
gospel
message
in
those
wilds
our
indian
narrator
when
he
had
finished
his
recital
of
missionary
labors
in
this
and
other
regions
would
always
add
with
marked
emphasis
it
is
firmly
believed
by
our
people
among
all
their
tribes
that
upon
every
spot
where
the
christian
sacrifice
was
first
offered
a
catholic
church
will
one
day
be
there
seemed
to
his
protestant
listeners
but
slight
probability
of
this
prediction
ever
being
fulfilled
in
vermont
settled
for
the
most
part
by
the
straitest
sect
of
the
puritans
as
there
was
not
then
or
until
twenty
years
from
that
time
a
catholic
priest
or
church
in
the
state
yet
at
this
writing
and
the
fact
has
presented
itself
before
us
with
startling
effect
while
tracing
these
imperfect
reminiscences
there
is
at
every
point
indicated
in
his
narrative
a
fine
church
and
in
many
places
flourishing
catholic
schools
the
labors
of
an
eminent
servant
of
god
to
whom
vermont
can
not
be
too
grateful
have
been
particularly
blessed
on
the
isle
la
motte
where
the
banner
of
the
cross
was
first
unfurled
within
her
territory
a
beautiful
church
has
been
erected
there
with
a
thriving
congregation
and
school
much
as
remains
to
be
accomplished
in
this
field
when
we
reflect
upon
all
that
has
been
done
since
the
first
quarter
of
this
xixth
century
we
can
see
great
cause
for
encouragement
and
gratitude
to
almighty
god
who
has
not
withheld
his
blessing
from
the
work
of
his
servants
of
the
earliest
and
the
latest
times
on
their
way
they
went
and
wept
scattering
the
seed
the
fruits
of
which
we
are
now
gathering
into
sheaves
with
great
joy
finding
a
lost
church
the
present
age
is
one
of
discovery
in
spite
of
the
wise
saying
under
the
sun
is
new
mankind
wiser
in
its
own
conceit
than
the
wise
man
insists
upon
the
newness
of
its
every
production
in
rome
a
different
spirit
prevails
while
the
new
is
not
entirely
neglected
the
great
delight
of
many
romans
is
to
find
something
old
the
older
the
better
they
live
so
much
in
the
past
that
they
follow
with
an
eager
interest
the
various
steps
taken
to
enlighten
them
on
the
lives
and
deeds
of
the
men
of
old
their
ancestors

the
soil

in
the
faith
which
they
profess

it
has
been
said
that

as
a

to
be
more
the
gift

of
the
most
important

the
subject

paper
tor

a
name
not
much
known
out
of

yet
it
designates
a
place
which
was
of
some
importance
in
its
day
the
traveller
who
contemplates
the
works
of
ancient
art
collected
in
the
vatican
museum
can
not
fail
to
be
interested
in
two
very
beautiful
black
and
white
mosaics
which
form
the
floor
of
the
gallery
known
as
the
braccio
nuovo
mythological
fables
and
homeric
legends
are
represented
in
these
pavements
and
they
come
from
tor
marancia
in
the
gallery
of
the
candelabra
and
in
the
library
of
the
same
museum
a
collection
of
frescos
busts
statues
and
mosaics
of
excellent
workmanship
and
of
great
interest
likewise
discovered
at
tor
marancia
are
exhibited
all
these
objects
were
found
at
that
place
in
the
course
of
excavations
made
there
in
the
reign
of
pope
pius
vi
in
ancient
times
a
villa
stood
at
tor
marancia
of
which
these
formed
the
decorations
at
this
spot
also
is
found
the
entrance
to
a
very
extensive
catacomb
which
contains
three
floors
and
diverges
in
long
winding
ways
under
the
soil
of
the
campagna
the
catacomb
has
been
called
by
the
name
of
domitilla
on
evidence
found
during
the
excavations
made
there
this
lady
was
a
member
of
the
flavian
family
which
gave
three
occupants
to
the
imperial
throne
vespasian
titus
and
domitian
it
is
a
fact
that
those
early
christians
who
were
blessed
with
wealth
were
in
the
habit
of
interring
the
bodies
of
their
brethren
of
saints
and
of
martyrs
within
the
enclosure
of
their
villas
such
villas
were
situated
outside
the
limits
of
the
city
and
hence
we
find
the
entrance
to
every
catacomb
beyond
the
city
walls
with
the
solitary
exception
of
the
catacomb
or
grottos
of
the
vatican
and
the
entrances
to
all
of
them
are
found
in
sites
ascertained
to
have
been
the
property
of
christians
it
might
be
easy
to
multiply
instances
of
this
taking
the
facts
from
the
of
the
martyrs
wherein
the
places
of
sepulture
are
indicated
and
the
names
of
those
who
bestowed
the
last
rites
upon
the
dead
recorded
domitilla
or
flavia
domitilla
as
she
is
sometimes
termed
was
a
niece
of
the
consul
flavius
clemens
who
was
cousin
of

domitian
she
was

after
a
life
spent
in
charitable
works
amongst
which
was
the
burial
of
the
martyrs
a
catacomb
near
the
ardeatine
way
the
same
of
which
we
write
she
also
suffered
martyrdom
her
two
servants
nereus
and
achilleus
were
put
to
death
previously
and
their
bodies
were
placed
in
this
catacomb
by
domitilla
in
while
de
rossi
was
pursuing
his
researches
in
the
catacomb
of
domitilla
he
came
upon
the
foundations
of
a
building
which
pierced
the
second
floor
of
the
subterranean
cemetery
this
was
a
most
unusual
occurrence
and
the
eminent
archæologist
eagerly
followed
up
his
discovery
he
found
a
marble
slab
which
recorded
the
giving
up
of
a
space
for
burial
indulgentia
flaviæ
a
confirmation
of
the
proprietorship
of
the
place
de
rossi
naturally
concluded
that
the
building
thus
incorporated
in
the
christian
cemetery
was
of
great
importance
the
or
of
the
dead
were
very
large
which
indicates
great
antiquity
the
inscriptions
likewise
were
of
a
very
early
date
and
adorned
with
heads
marble
columns
overturned
and
other
signs
led
the
discoverer
to
the
conclusion
that
he
had
come
upon
the
foundations
of
a
church
constructed
within
this
cemetery
in
the
course
of
his
excavations
he
had
penetrated
into
the
open
air
and
found
himself
in
a
hollow
depression
formed
by
the
falling
in
of
the
surface
amongst
other
objects
discovered
were
four
marble
slabs
containing
epitaphs
furnished
with
consular
dates
of
the
years
and
and
also
a
form
of
contract
by
which
the
right
of
burial
in
the
edifice
was
sold
the
proprietor
of
the
land
above
the
cemetery
opposed
the
continuance
of
the
excavations
and
the
discoverer
obliged
to
withdraw
covered
up
the
materials
already
found
with
earth
and
turned
his
attention
to
other
objects
in
another
place
twenty
years
after
in
monsignor
de
merode
purchased
the
land
overlying
the
catacomb
and
church
and
the
excavations
were
again
undertaken
under
most
favorable
circumstances
in
vain
did
the
commission
of
sacred
archæology
under
de
guidance
seek
for
the
four
marble
columns
and
the
two
beautiful
that
had
been
seen
there
twenty
years
before
the
proprietor
is
supposed
to
have
carried
them
away
but
they
found
instead
the
floor
of
the
church
or
basilica
with
its
three
naves
the
bases
of
the
four
columns
the
apse
the
place
where
the
altar
stood
and
the
space
occupied
by
the
episcopal
chair
behind
the
altar
the
basilica
is
as
large
as
that
of
san
lorenzo
beyond
the
walls
the
left
aisle
is
sixty
feet
long
by
thirteen
broad
the
central
nave
is
feet
broad
and
the
right
aisle
which
is
not
yet
entirely
unearthed
is
considered
to
be
of
the
same
breadth
as
the
first
mentioned
the
greatest
depth
of
the
apse
is
fifteen
feet
church
says
de
rossi
of
gigantic
proportions
for
an
edifice
constructed
in
the
bowels
of
the
earth
and
at
the
deep
level
of
the
second
floor
of
a
subterranean
here
then
was
a
basilica
or
church
discovered
in
the
midst
of
a
catacomb
that
the
latter
belonged
to
flavia
domitilla
was
well
known
and
yet
another
proof
which
illustrates
archæological
difficulties
and
the
method
of
overcoming
them
was
found
here
it
was
a
broken
slab
of
marble
containing
a
portion
of
an
inscription
rvm
and
having
the
image
of
an
anchor
at
the
point
it
was
concluded
that
the
anchor
was
placed
at
an
equal
distance
from
both
ends
of
the
inscription
and
the
discoverer
with
the
knowledge
he
already
has
of
the
place
supplied
the
letters
which
he
considered
wanting
to
the
completion
of
the
inscription
and
thus
produced
the
words
sepvlcrvm
flaviorvm
sepulchre
of
the
flavii
this
reading
is
very
probably
the
right
one
and
its
probability
is
greatly
strengthened
by
the
position
of
the
anchor
since
the
full
inscription
as
here
shown
leaves
that
sign
still
in
the
centre
but
to
find
the
name
borne
by
these
ruins
when
the
building
of
which
they
are
the
sole
remnants
was
fresh
and
new
presented
a
task
to
their
discoverer
it
was
necessary
to
seek
in
ancient
works
pontifical
books
and
codices
for
some
account
of
a
basilica
on
the
ardeatine
way
in
the
life
of
gregory
the
great
it
is
related
that
this
pontiff
delivered
one
of
his
homilies
the
cemetery
of
domitilla
on
the
ardeatine
way
at
the
church
of
the
pontifical
books
and
codices
although
they
differ
in
details
some
saying
in
the
cemetery
of
domitilla
and
others
in
that
of
nereus
and
archilleus
which
is
the
same
place
under
another
name
agree
in
the
principal
fact
on
the
small
remnant
of
plaster
remaining
on
the
wall
of
the
apse
an
unskilled
hand
had
traced
a
or
drawing
scratched
on
the
plaster
with
a
pointed
instrument
somewhat
resembling
those
found
on
the
walls
of
pompeii
this
represents
a
bishop
vested
in
episcopal
robes
seated
in
a
chair
in
the
act
of
delivering
a
discourse
this
rude
sketch
of
a
bishop
so
occupied
taken
in
conjunction
with
the
fact
that
gregory
did
here
deliver
one
of
his
homilies
is
a
link
in
the
chain
of
evidence
which
identifies
the
ruin
with
the
ancient
basilica
of
petronilla
but
a
still
more
convincing
testimony
was
forthcoming
a
large
fragment
of
marble
containing
a
portion
of
what
appeared
to
have
been
a
long
inscription
was
found
in
the
apse
there
were
but
few
complete
words
in
this
fragment
and
these
were
chiefly
the
termination
of
lines
in
what
seemed
to
have
been
a
metrical
composition
odd
words
selected
at
random
from
a
poem
standing
alone
devoid
of
preceding
or
succeeding
words
might
not
seem
to
furnish
very
rich
materials
even
to
an
archæologist
these
wandering
words
were
however
recognized
to
be
the
terminal
words
of
a
poem
or
eulogium
written
by
pope
damasus
in
honor
of
the
martyrs
nereus
and
achilleus
now
the
connection
between
this
metrical
eulogium
and
the
basilica
was
to
be
sought
for
in
the
einsiedeln
codex
the
place
where
this
poem
was
to
be
seen
is
stated
to
have
been
the
sepulchre
of
ss
nereus
and
achilleus
on
the
appian
way
at
petronilla
the
poem
or
rather
this
fragment
of
it
being
found
at
this
sepulchre
it
was
natural
to
conclude
that
the
church
was
that
of
petronilla
the
appian
way
is
the
great
from
which
the
ardeatine
way
branches
off
near
this
spot
again
the
basilica
of
petronilla
was
frequented
by
pilgrims
from
many
nations
in
the
viith
century
among
these
were
gauls
germans
and
britons
in
their
itineraries
of
the
sepulchres
in
rome
and
in
the
collection
of
the
metrical
epigraphs
written
at
these
places
it
is
proved
that
the
original
name
of
this
church
was
that
of
petronilla
the
ardeatine
way
is
the
church
of
petronilla
say
these
old
documents
and
they
likewise
inform
us
that
nereus
and
achilleus
and
petronilla
herself
are
buried
there

a
second
fragment
of
the
slab
containing
the
metrical
composition
of
pope
damasus
has
since
been
found
and
this
goes
to
confirm
the
testimony
furnished
by
the
former
fragment
in
the
following
copy
of
the
inscription
the
capital
letters
on
the
side
are
those
on
the

discovered

the
date
of
the
church
was
likewise
ascertained
it
is
known
that
pope
damasus
the
great
preserver
of
the
graves
would
never
allow
the
christian
cemeteries
to
be
disturbed
for
the
purpose
of
building
a
church
therein
and
although
he
himself
strongly
desired
that
his
remains
should
repose
in
one
of
these
sacred
places
by
the
side
of
his
predecessors
he
abandoned
this
desire
rather
than
remove
the
sacred
ashes
of
the
dead
it
may
naturally
be
concluded
then
that
this
church
was
built
after
his
day
he
died
in
as
were
the
churches
of
agnes
lawrence
and
alexander
all
of
which
are
beyond
the
city
walls
and
built
in
catacombs
the
catacombs
under
the
church
of
petronilla
showed
an
inscription
bearing
the
date
of
and
in
the
church
itself
a
monumental
slab
with
the
date
of
has
been
found
it
is
thus
almost
certain
that
between
the
highest
date
found
and
the
lowest
date
found
the
church
that
is
between
the
years
and
the
basilica
of
petronilla
was
constructed
for
about
three
centuries
and
a
half
this
church
was
well
frequented
we
have
records
of
gifts
sent
to
it
precious
vestments
by
pope
gregory
who
reigned
from
to
but
in
the
longobards
came
down
upon
rome
they
desecrated
the
churches
and
cemeteries
around
the
city
and
then
began
the
siege
of
rome
after
peace
was
made
the
pontiff
of
the
period
paul
transferred
the
relics
and
remains
of
the
saints
to
safer
custody
and
the
church
of
petronilla
became
deserted
from
unmistakable
signs
it
seems
that
this
desertion
was
conducted
in
a
most
regular
manner
and
that
it
was
closed
and
despoiled
of
its
precious
objects
the
door
which
entered
the
left
aisle
was
found
walled
up
the
altar
the
seats
of
the
choir
the
episcopal
chair
and
the
ambons
or
marble
pulpits
ware
all
removed
and
transported
elsewhere
the
floor
of
the
church
so
far
below
the
level
of
the
surrounding
soil
formed
a
for
the
water
which
drained
through
the
neighboring
lands
after
rains
had
fallen
and
this
undoubtedly
formed
the
strongest
reason
for
the
abandonment
of
petronilla
nothing
was
left
in
it
but
and
sepulchres
the
pavements
with
their
marble
epitaphs
so
valuable

revealing
history

their

more
than
a

the
hundred

who
came
from
america
with
a

friends
assembled
on
the
of

to
pray
in
that
disentombed
old

they
had
come
from
a

undreamt

had
formerly

may
have
felt

about

the

but
no
worship
exists
which
is
celebrated
in
the
open

a
special

is
required
for

adoration
because
our

urges
us
to
gather
together
for

the

to
shelter
our

it
would
require
a
considerable
amount
of
courage
to
betake
ourselves
thither
especially
in

the
philosophers
who
find

paid
to
the

virgin
mary
in
the
course
of
which
he
shows
triumphantly
that
the
definition
of
her
immaculate
conception
was
no
new
doctrine
but
a
mere
definite
and
dogmatic
statement
of
a
doctrine
which
had
been
all
along
held
implicitly
in
the
church
the
following
simile
illustrative
of
this
argument
appears
to
us
to
be
worth
quoting
science
which

depths
of

which
become
more
bright
as
they
are
more
attentively
observed
and
which
end
by
becoming
stars
of
splendor
these
stars
are
not
of

they
are
not
new
they
are
only
perceived
something
analogous

place
in
the

of
the

itself
and
develops
by
degrees
sometimes
the
shock
of
controversy
illuminates
them
then
comes
a
definition
to
invest
them
with
fresh
splendor
but
in
receiving
this
supplement
of
light
destined
to
make
them
better
understood
by
the
faithful
they
lose
nothing
of
their
proper
nature
their
essence
is
not
in
the
slightest
degree
changed
only
our
minds
appropriate
them
with
more

have

encouragement
in
these
days
of
combined
luxury
and
destitution
to
look
over
the
history
of
those
many
of
whom
were
delicately
reared
who
left
all
for
god
content
to
do
whatsoever
he
appointed
them
to
do
and
to
submit
to
extraordinary
mortifications
for
his
sake
the
work
embraces
six
brief
biographies
of
visitation
nuns
eminent
for
their
labors
for
the
moral
and
intellectual
education
of
their
charges
and
in
other
good
and
charitable
offices
their
names
even
may
be
quite
new
to
readers
but
that
fact
is
all
the
more
in
keeping
with
their
hidden
lives
we
have
said
enough
to
indicate
the
general
character
of
the
volume
john
dorrien
a
novel
by
julia
kavanagh
new
york
appleton
the
writer
succeeds
in
the
very
opening
chapter
in
so
portraying
the
character
of
a
child
as
to
make
it
a
living
breathing
reality
to
the
reader
the
story
of
his
humble
life
in
childhood
and
his
struggles
and
trials
in
later
years
is
told
without
any
attempt
at
fine
writing
indeed
all
the
characters
are
simply
and
well
drawn
and
retain
their
individuality
to
the
end
the
heroine
neglected
in
childhood
and
without
any
guide
in
matters
of
faith
is
easily
persuaded
by
a
suitor
that
religion
is
contrary
to
reason
and
thus
left
to
her
own
unaided
judgment
and
notwithstanding
her
innate
love
of
truth
soon
finds
herself
entangled
in
a
web
of
deceit
and
hypocrisy
she
only
escapes
the
unhappiness
which
such
a
course
entails
by
forsaking
it
the
moral
of
the
tale
if
that
is
not
an
obsolete
term
is
what
the
reader
would
naturally
infer
the
necessity
of
early
religious
instruction
and
the
advantage
even
in
this
life
of
a
belief
in
revealed
truth
we
are
glad
to
note
the
absence
of
the
faults
which
disfigure
much
of
the
imaginative
literature
of
the
day
not
excepting
we
are
sorry
to
say
that
which
emanates
from
the
own
sex
we
see
no
attempt
to
give
false
views
of
life
or
to
undermine
the
moral
and
religious
principles
of
the
reader
on
the
contrary
there
is
reason
to
infer
much
that
is
positively
good
though
not
so
definitely
stated
as
we
should
have
liked
the
bible
and
the
rule
of
faith
by
the
abbé

protestantism
is
defunct
it
is
in
its
last
throes
it
has
not
sufficient
vitality
left
to
care
for
its
own
doctrines
such
as
they
are
as
a
religion
it
has
almost
ceased
to
exist
disobedience
to
the
faith
has
been
succeeded
by
indifference
indifference
by
the
hatred
of
christ
its
rickety
old
doctrines
whose
folly
has
been
exposed
over
and
over
again
thousands
of
times
have
quietly
tumbled
out
of
existence
protestants
themselves
have
almost
forgotten
them
and
certainly
do
not
care
enough
about
them
to
defend
them
paganism
has
returned
paganism
in
its
last
stage
of
sceptical
development
we
have
to
contend
now
for
the
divinity
of
christ
and
the
existence
of
a
god
the
bible
and
the
rule
of
faith
are
up
amongst
the
lumber
yet
it
may
be
as
the
writer
of
this
work
asserts
we
much
doubt
it
however
that
there
are
still
poor
souls
in
the
bosom
of
protestantism
a
prey
to
the
anguish
of
to
such
the
abbé
treatise
on
the
rule
of
faith
may
be
of
the
utmost
service
the
argument
is
extremely
terse
and
lucid
in
short
were
the
minds
of
protestant
fanatics
open
to
reason
it
could
not
fail
to
convince
them
of
the
unreasoning
folly
of
their
notions
about
the
bible
being
the
one
only
rule
of
faith
the
first
part
of
this
work
treats
of
the
rule
of
faith
in
general
and
proves
amongst
other
things
that
such
a
rule
must
be
sure
efficient
and
perpetual
to
put
an
end
to
controversies
the
second
part
exhibits
the
logical
impossibility
of
the
protestant
rule
of
faith
remote
and
proximate
that
is
to
say
that
it
is
impossible
for
the
unexplained
text
of
the
bible
to
be
a
sure
efficient
and
perpetual
rule
of
faith
and
for
an
immediate
inspiration
of
its
meaning
to
individuals
by
the
holy
ghost
to
be
its
means
of
explanation
the
third
part
proves
very
exhaustively
that
the
catholic
rule
of
faith
is
the
only
possible
sure
efficient
and
perpetual
one
namely
holy
scripture
the
remote
rule
and
the
teaching
church
the
proximate
one
to
any
souls
the
bosom
of
who
are
prey
to
the
anguish
of
doubt
if
indeed
there
be
such
we
cordially
recommend
this
treatise
its
tone
is
kind
and
gentle
its
reasoning
irresistible
and
with
the
blessing
of
god
is
able
to
put
an
end
to
all
their
doubts
on
the
fundamental
question

to
the
true

a

assumes
the

startles
as
well
as
offends
the
public

by
his
useless

baseless
indictment
against

it

even
by

effectually
driven
this
new
champion
of
the
old
party
in
england
from
the
field
of
polemics
but
like
all
new
recruits
the
seems
incapable
of
realizing
defeat
or
perhaps
is
anxious
at
least
to
retire
with
the
honors
of

not
content
with
the
serial

has
just

volume
with
a
under
the
title
of

the

in
a
title
as
unbecoming
the
gravity
of
his
subjects
as
it
is
unsupported
by
the
contents
of
the
work
the
preface
to
the
republication
not
only
reiterates
his
accusations
on
all
points
but
the
author
not
satisfied
with
his
new
part
as
theologian
essays
the
of
historical
critic
and
thus
gives
prominence
to
a
historical
question
of
deep
interest
and
of
especial
importance
to
the
catholics
of
this
country
the
same
which
inspired
attacks
against
the
church
against
his
catholic
and
against
the
most
august
and
venerable
personage
in
christendom
has
also
induced
him
to
deny
to
the
catholic
founders
of
maryland
the
honorable
renown
accorded
to
them
heretofore
by
historians
with
singular
unanimity
of
having
when
in
power
practised
religious
toleration
towards
all
christian
sects
and
secured
freedom
of
conscience
not
only
by
their
unwavering
action
and
practice
but
also
by
giving
it
the
stability
and
sanctions
of
statute
law
this
is
certainly
the
only
phase
in
this
celebrated
controversy
upon
which
it
remains
for
gladstone
to
be
answered
his
eminence
cardinal
manning
in
vatican
decrees
in
their
bearing
on
civil
at
page
new
york
edition
writes
the
same
reasons
i
deplore
the
haste
i
must
say
the
passion
which
carried
away
so
large
a
mind
to
affirm
or
to
imply
that
the
church
of
this
day
would
if
she
could
use
torture
and
force
and
coercion
in
matters
of
religious
in
the
year
the
catholics
of
belgium
were
in
a
vast
majority
but
they
did
not
use
their
political
power
to
constrain
the
faith
or
conscience
of
any
man
the
of
belgium
were
the
work
of
catholics
this
is
the
most
recent
example
of
what
catholics
would
do
if
they
were
in
possession
of
power
but
there
is
one
more
ancient
and
more
homely
for
us
englishmen
it
is
found
at
a
date
when
the
old
traditions
of
the
catholic
church
were
still
vigorous
in
the
minds
of
if
the
modern
spirit
had
any
share
in
producing
the
constitution
of
belgium
it
certainly
had
no
share
in
producing
the
constitution
of
maryland
lord
baltimore
who
had
been
secretary
of
state
under
james
in
emigrated
to
the
american
plantations
where
through
lord
influence
he
had
obtained
a
grant
of
they
named
their
new
country
maryland
and
there
they
settled
the
oath
of
the
governor
was
in
these
terms
will
not
by
myself
or
any
other
directly
or
indirectly
molest
any
person
professing
to
believe
in
jesus
christ
for
or
in
respect
of
lord
baltimore
invited
the
puritans
of
massachusetts
who
like
himself
had
renounced
their
country
for
sake
to
come
into
maryland
in
when
active
persecution
had
sprung
up
again
in
england
the
council
of
maryland
on
the
of
april
passed
this
statute
whereas
the
forcing
of
the
conscience
in
matters
of
religion
hath
frequently
fallen
out
to
be
of
dangerous
consequence
in
the
commonwealth
where
it
has
been
practised
and
for
the
more
quiet
and
peaceable
government
of
the
province
and
the
better
to
preserve
mutual
love
and
amity
among
the
inhabitants
no
person
within
the
province
professing
to
believe
in
jesus
christ
shall
be
anyways
troubled
molested
or
discountenanced
for
his
or
her
religion
or
in
the
free
exercise
the
episcopalians
and
protestants
fled
from
virginia
into
maryland
such
was
the
commonwealth
founded
by
a
catholic
upon
the
broad
moral
law
i
have
here
laid
down
that
faith
is
an
act
of
the
will
and
that
to
force
men
to
profess
what
they
do
not
believe
is
contrary
to
the
law
of
god
and
that
to
generate
faith
by
force
is
morally
gladstone
in
his
page
replies
to
the
above
as
follows
appears
to
me
that
archbishop
manning
has
completely
misapprehended
the
history
of
the
settlement
of
maryland
and
the
establishment
of
toleration
there
for
all
believers
in
the
holy
trinity
it
was
a
wise
measure
for
which
the
two
lords
baltimore
father
and
son
deserve
the
highest
honor
but
the
measure
was
really
defensive
and
its
main
and
very
legitimate
purpose
plainly
was
to
secure
the
free
exercise
of
the
roman
catholic
religion
immigration
into
the
colony
was
by
the
charter
free
and
only
by
this
and
other
popular
provisions
could
the
territory
have
been
extricated
from
the
grasp
of
its
neighbors
in
virginia
who
claimed
it
as
their
own
it
was
apprehended
that
the
puritans
would
flood
it
as
they
did
and
it
seemed
certain
that
but
for
this
excellent
provision
the
handful
of
roman
catholic
founders
would
have
been
unable
to
hold
their
ground
the
facts
are
given
in
of
the
united
vol
chap
again
in
his
to
and
the
newest
fashions
in
page
gladstone
writes
has
long
been
customary
to
quote
the
case
of
maryland
in
proof
that
more
than
two
centuries
ago
the
roman
catholic
church
where
power
was
in
its
hands
could
use
it
for
the
purposes
of
toleration
archbishop
manning
has
repeated
the
boast
and
with
very
large
exaggeration
have
already
shown
from
that
in
the
case
of
maryland
there
was
no
question
of
a
merciful
use
of
power
towards
others
but
simply
of
a
wise
and
defensive
prudence
with
respect
to
themselves
that
is
to
say
so
far
as
the
tolerant
legislation
of
the
colony
was
the
work
of
roman
catholics
but
it
does
not
appear
to
have
been
their
work
by
the
fourth
article
of
the
charter
we
find
that
no
church
could
be
consecrated
there
except
according
to
the
laws
of
the
church
at
home
the
tenth
article
guaranteed
to
the
colonists
generally
privileges
franchises
and
liberties
of
this
our
kingdom
of
it
was
in
that
the
maryland
act
of
toleration
was
passed
which
however
prescribed
the
punishment
of
death
for
any
one
who
denied
the
trinity
of
the
small
legislative
body
which
passed
it
appear
to
have
been
protestant
the
recorded
numbers
being
sixteen
and
eight
respectively
the
colony
was
open
to
the
immigration
of
puritans
and
all
protestants
and
any
permanent
and
successful
oppression
by
a
handful
of
roman
catholics
was
altogether
impossible
but
the
colonial
act
seems
to
have
been
an
echo
of
the
order
of
the
house
of
commons
at
home
on
the
of
october
that
the
inhabitants
of
the
summer
islands
and
such
others
as
shall
join
themselves
to
them
without
any
molestation
or
trouble
have
and
enjoy
the
liberty
of
their
consciences
in
matters
of
and
of
a
british
ordinance
of
the
whole
then
the
picture
of
maryland
legislation
is
a
gratifying
one
but
the
historic
theory
which
assigns
the
credit
of
it
to
the
roman
church
has
little
foundation
in
let
us
first
test
accuracy
and
consistency
as
a
historical
critic
he
begins
by
alleging
that
the
maryland
toleration
act
was
a
measure
of
defensive
prudence
in
the
interests
of
the
catholics
themselves
and
that
main
and
very
legitimate
purpose
plainly
was
to
secure
the
free
exercise
of
the
roman
catholic
he
then
asserts
that
this
act
of
toleration
was
not
the
work
of
the
catholics
at
all
but
of
a
protestant
majority
in
the
legislature
which
passed
it
we
have
then
here
presented
the
extraordinary
picture
of
an
alleged
protestant
legislature
passing
a
law
which
was
really
intended
to
protect
catholics
against
protestant
ascendency
and
apprehended
protestant
persecution
and
whose
and
very
legitimate
purpose
was
to
secure
the
free
exercise
of
the
roman
catholic
surely
the
protestants
of
that
day
were
liberal
and
generous
especially
as
it
was
an
age
of
persecution
when
not
only
were
catholics
hunted
down
both
in
england
and
her
virginia
and
new
england
colonies
but
even
protestants
of
different
sects
were
relentlessly
persecuting
each
other
and
in
what
proper
sense
can
be
said
to
have
been
protestants
with
whom
it
was
very
legitimate
to
legislate
in
the
express
interests
of
roman
catholics
gladstone
also
states
that
the
toleration
act
was
passed
in
the
apprehension
of
an
influx
of
puritans
and
to
protect
the
colony
the
grasp
of
its
neighbors
in
whereas
his
favorite
author
bancroft
informs
gladstone
that
lord
baltimore
invited
both
the
episcopalians
of
virginia
and
the
puritans
of
new
england
into
his
domains
offering
a
gift
of
lands
as
an
inducement
and
it
is
a
historical
fact
that
numbers
of
them
accepted
the
invitation
again
gladstone
while
apparently
treating
the
toleration
act
as
a
catholic
measure
animadverts
with
evident
disapproval
on

who
denied

then
immediately
he
claims
that
the
legislature
which
passed

he
writes
to
have
been
thus
imposing
upon
his
protestant
friends
the
odium
of
inflicting
death
for
the
exercise
of
conscience

religious
belief

no

the
common
sentiments

these
irreverent
words
in

to
the
blessed
virgin
mary

peerless
and
immaculate
lady
whom
of
the
christian
world
venerate
as
the
mother
of
god
sinlessness
of
the
virgin
mary
and
the
personal
infallibility
of
the
pope
are
the
characteristic
dogmas
of
modern
both
rest
on
pious
fiction
and
fraud
both
present
a
refined
idolatry
by
clothing
a
pure
humble
woman
and
a
mortal
sinful
man
with
divine
attributes
the
dogma
of
the
immaculate
conception

exempts
the
virgin
mary
from
sin
and
guilt
perverts
christianism
into
the
worship
of
a

virtually
substituted
for
the
worship
of
and
yet
with
such
sentiments
in
which
doubtless
the
protestants
of
maryland
in
concurred
he
attributes

and
claims
for
those
protestants

he
says
constituted
of
the
maryland
colonial
legislature
in
the
passage
of
a
law
which
enacted

shall
use
or
utter
any
reproachful

the
following
anecdote
related
by
the
protestant
bozman
is
quite
pertinent
to
our
subject
and
to
our
cause
in
the
time
of
the
long
parliament
when
the
differences
between
the
lord
baltimore
and
colonell
samuel
matthews
as
agent
for
the
colony
of
virginia
were
depending
before
a
committee
of
that
parliament
for
the
navy
that
clause
in
the
sayd
law
concerning
the
virgin
mary
was
at
that
committee
objected
as
an
exception
against
his
lordship
whereupon
a
worthy
member
of
the
sayd
committee
stood
up
and
sayd
that
he
wondered
that
any
such
exception
should
be
taken
against
his
lordship
for
says
hee
doth
not
the
scripture
say
that
all
generations
shall
call
her
blessed

no

purely
a
sectarian
tract
hostile
to
every
catholic
view
and
interest
and
partisan
in
spirit
and
in
matter
the
latter
is
a
few
pages
of
printed
matter
consisting
of
three
newspaper
articles
published
last
year
in
the
of
paul
minnesota
and
recently
reprinted
in
the
of
the
same
place
the
editor
of
which
states
that
the
author
of
the
letters
is
the
rev
edward
neill
also
a
protestant
minister
and
president
of
macalester
college
the

of
were
sharply
and
ably
replied
to
by
william
markoe
formerly
an
episcopal
minister
now
a
member
of
the
catholic
church
the
letters
of
are
more
sectarian
than
historical
and
can
not
be
quoted
in
a
controversy
in
which
such
names
as
chalmers
bancroft
mcsherry
bozman
figure
the
attack
of
on
the
personal
character
of
lord
baltimore
is
enough
to
condemn
his
effort
but
principal
author
is
bancroft
from
whose
pages
he
claims
to
have
shown
that
the
case
of
maryland
there
was
of
a
merciful
use
of
power
towards
others
but
of
a
wise
and
defensive
prudence
with
respect
to
motives
of
are
thus
substituted
for
those
of
and
if
this
were
correctly
stated
why
does
gladstone
state
that
the
act
of
toleration
was
a
measure
which
the
two
lords
baltimore
father
and
son
deserve
the
highest
but
our
task
is
now
to
inquire
how
far
his
author
sustains
gladstone
in
denying
to
the
catholics
of
maryland
who
enacted
religious
toleration
all
motives
of
benevolence
and
mercy
bancroft
on
the
contrary
asserts
that
the
government
of
maryland
was
erected
on
a
as
extraordinary
as
its
results
were
in
speaking
of
lord
baltimore
the
founder
of
maryland
its
chief
statesman
and
he
extols
his
of
and
and
proceeds
to
say
deserves
to
be
ranked
among
the
most
wise
and
of
all
ages
he
was
the
first
in
the
history
of
the
christian
world
to
seek
for
religious
security
and
peace
by
the
practice
of
justice
and
not
by
the
exercise
of
power
to
plan
the
establishment
of
popular
institutions
with
the
enjoyment
of
liberty
of
conscience
to
advance
the
career
of
civilization
by
recognizing
the
rightful
equality
of
all
christian
sects
the
asylum
of
papists
was
the
spot
where
in
a
remote
corner
of
the
world
on
the
banks
of
rivers
which
as
yet
had
hardly
been
explored
the
of
a
proprietary
adopted
religious
freedom
as
the
of
the
referring
to
the
act
of
taking
possession
of
their
new
homes
in
maryland
by
the
catholic
pilgrims
the
same
author
says
thereby
liberty
obtained
a
home
its
only
home
in
the
wide
world
at
the
humble
village
which
bore
the
name
of
and
speaking
of
the
progress
of
the
colony
he
further
says
the
institutions
and
munificence
of
baltimore
the
dreary
wilderness
soon
bloomed
with
swarming
life
and
activity
of
prosperous
settlements
the
roman
catholics
who
were
oppressed
by
the
laws
of
england
were
sure
to
find
a
peaceful
asylum
in
the
quiet
harbors
of
the
chesapeake
and
there
too
protestants
were
sheltered
against
protestant
such
in
fine
is
the
repeated
language
of
an
author
whom
gladstone
refers
to
in
proof
of
his
assertion
that
toleration
in
maryland
was
a
measure
of
chalmers
bears
the
following
testimony
to
the
same
point
lord
baltimore
the
of
his
province
upon
the
broad
of
security
to
property
and
of
freedom
of
religion
granting
in
absolute
fee
fifty
acres
of
land
to
every
emigrant
establishing
christianity
according
to
the
old
common
law
of
which
it
is
a
part
without
allowing
to
any
particular
sect
the
wisdom
of
his
choice
soon
converted
a
dreary
wilderness
into
a
prosperous
and
judge
story
with
the
history
of
the
colony
from
its
beginning
and
the
charter
before
him
adds
the
weight
of
judicial
approval
in
the
following
words
is
certainly
very
honorable
to
the
liberality
and
public
spirit
of
the
proprietary
that
he
should
have
introduced
into
his
policy
the
doctrine
of
general
toleration
and
equality
among
christian
sects
for
he
does
not
appear
to
have
gone
further
and
have
thus
given
the
earliest
example
of
a
legislator
inviting
his
subjects
to
the
free
indulgence
of
religious
opinion
this
was
anterior
to
the
settlement
of
rhode
island
and
therefore
merits
the
enviable
rank
of
being
the
first
recognition
among
the
colonists
of
the
glorious
and
indefeasible
rights
of
but
there
is
another
view
clearly
sustained
by
an
important
and
certain
chain
of
facts
which
has
never
occurred
to
the
historical
writers
on
maryland
toleration
at
least
in
this
connection
though
they
give
the
facts
upon
which
the
view
is
based
and
which
wholly
destroys
the
theory
of
gladstone
and
his
authorities
the
latter
may
dispute
in
regard
to
the
merits
and
motives
of
the
statute
of
but
they
do
not
touch
the
real
question
it
is
an
incontestable
fact
that
the
religious
toleration
which
historians
have
so
much
extolled
in
the
catholic
colonists
and
founders
of
maryland
did
not
originate
with
or
derive
its
existence
from
that
law
of
but
on
the
contrary
it
existed
long
anterior
to
and
independent
of
it
this
great
feature
in
the
catholic
government
of
maryland
had
been
established
by
the
catholic
his
agents
and
colonists
and
faithfully
practised
for
fifteen
years
prior
to
the
toleration
act
of
from
to
it
had
been
enforced
with
unwavering
firmness
and
protected
with
exalted
benevolence
this
important
fact
is
utterly
ignored
by
gladstone
and
his
authors
the
rev
ethan
allen
and
the
rev
edward
neill
but
the
facts
related
by
bancroft
and
indeed
by
all
historians
prove
it
beyond
a
question
bancroft
records
that
the
very
of
the
colony
were
laid
upon
the
of
religious
toleration
and
throughout
the
eulogiums
pronounced
by
him
on
the
religious
toleration
of
maryland
which
we
have
quoted
above
refers
entirely
to
the
period
of
the
fifteen
years
preceding
the
passage
of
the
act
of
the
toleration
act
was
nothing
else
than
the
declaration
of
the
existing
state
of
things
and
of
the
long
and
cherished
policy
and
practice
of
the
colony
a
formal
sanction
and
statutory
enactment
of
the
existing
common
law
of
the
province
before
proceeding
to
demonstrate
this
fact
we
will
briefly
examine
how
far
bancroft
sustains
the
theory
or
views
of
gladstone
in
regard
to
the
act
itself
after
extolling
the
motives
and
conduct
of
the
catholics
of
maryland
in
establishing
religious
toleration
as
we
have
remarked
above
during
the
fifteen
years
preceding
the
passage
of
the
act
bancroft
refers
to
that
statute
in
terms
of
highest
praise
he
barely
hints
at
the
possibility
that
a
foresight
on
the
part
of
the
colonists
of
impending
dangers
to
themselves
from
threatened
or
apprehended
protestant
ascendency
and
persecution
might
have
entered
among
the
motives
which
induced
them
to
pass
that
act
but
he
nowhere
asserts
the
fact
nor
does
he
allege
anything
beyond
conjecture
for
the
possibility
of
the
motive
indeed
his
mode
of
expressing
himself
indicates
that
though
he
thought
it
possible
his
own
impression
was
that
such
motive
did
not
suggest
in
part
even
the
passage
of
the
act
for
he
writes
with
a
foresight
of
impending
danger
and
an
earnest
desire
to
stay
its
approach
the
roman
catholics
of
maryland
with
the
earnest
concurrence
of
their
governor
and
of
the
proprietary
determined
to
place
upon
their
an
act
for
religious
freedom
which
had
ever
been
sacred
on
their
compare
this
with
the
language
of
gladstone
who
excludes
every
motive
but
that
of
and
refers
to
bancroft
in
support
of
his
view
but
does
not
quote
his
language
bancroft
on
the
other
hand
after
quoting
from
the
statute
exclaims
such
was
sublime
griffith
does
not
agree
with
the
suggestion
that
a
sense
of
fear
or
apprehension
entered
into
the
motives
of
the
maryland
lawgivers
and
says
this
liberty
did
not
proceed
from
fear
of
others
on
the
one
hand
or
licentious
dispositions
in
the
government
on
the
other
is
sufficiently
evident
from
the
penalties
prescribed
against
blasphemy
swearing
drunkenness
and
by
the
preceding
sections
of
the
act
and
proviso
at
the
end
that
such
exercise
of
religion
did
not
molest
or
conspire
against
the
proprietary
or
his
let
us
now
proceed
to
examine
still
further
whether
maryland
was
a
catholic
colony
whether
it
was
by
catholics
that
religious
toleration
was
established
there
and
whether
it
had
its
origin
in
the
act
of
or
in
the
long
previous
practice
and
persistent
generosity
and
mercy
of
the
catholic
rulers
of
the
province
it
is
true
that
while
the
territory
afterwards
granted
to
lord
baltimore
was
subject
to
the
virginia
charter
a
settlement
of
episcopalians
was
made
on
kent
island
but
they
were
very
few
in
numbers
always
adhered
to
virginia
rather
than
to
maryland
in
their
sympathies
were
so
turbulent
and
disloyal
that
governor
calvert
had
to
reduce
them
by
force
of
arms
and
no
one
has
ever
pretended
that
they
founded
a
state
we
will
show
what
relation
they
had
in
point
of
numbers
and
political
influence
to
the
colony
and
that
they
did
not
form
even
the
slightest
element
of
power
in
the
founding
of
the
province
maryland
was
founded
alone
by
the
catholic
lord
baltimore
and
his
colonists
such
is
the
voice
of
history
it
is
rather
disingenuous
in
the
reverend
authors
of
the
pamphlets
mentioned
by
gladstone
that
upon
so
flimsy
a
circumstance
they
assert
that
maryland
was
not
settled
first
by
catholics
their
voices
are
drowned
by
the
concurrent
voice
of
tradition
and
of
history
it
is
only
the
reassertion
of
the
pretensions
of
these
zealous
sectarians
by
so
respectable
a
person
as
gladstone
and
that
too
in
one
of
the
most
remarkable
controversies
of
the
age
that
renders
a
recurrence
to
the
historical
authorities
and
their
results
at
all
desirable
or
necessary
the
colony
of
maryland
was
conceived
in
the
spirit
of
liberty
it
was
the
flight
of
english
catholics
from
protestant
persecution
in
their
native
country
the
state
of
the
penal
laws
in
england
against
catholics
at
this
period
is
too
well
known
the
zealous
protestant
bozman
writes
that
they
severities
enough
to
keep
them
the
catholics
in
all
due
it
was
at
this
hour
of
their
extremest
suffering
that
the
catholics
of
england
found
a
friend
and
leader
in
sir
george
calvert
who
held
important
trusts
under
the
governments
of
james
and
charles
and
enjoyed
the
confidence
of
his
sovereigns
and
of
his
country
an
age
when
religious
controversy
still
continued
to
be
active
when
increasing
divisions
among
protestants
were
spreading
a
general
alarm
his
mind
sought
relief
from
controversy
in
the
bosom
of
the
roman
catholic
church
and
preferring
the
avowal
of
his
opinions
to
the
emoluments
of
office
he
resigned
his
place
and
openly
professed
his
even
after
this
he
was
advanced
to
the
peerage
under
the
title
of
lord
baltimore
an
irish
title
and
was
appointed
one
of
the
principal
secretaries
under
james
i
his
positions
in
the
government
gave
him
not
only
an
acquaintance
with
american
colonization
but
an
official
connection
with
it
of
these
he
now
availed
himself
to
provide
an
asylum
abroad
for
his
from
the
relentless
persecution
they
were
suffering
at
home
his
first
effort
was
to
found
a
catholic
colony
on
the
shores
of
newfoundland
a
settlement
was
begun
avalon
was
the
name
it
received
and
twice
did
lord
baltimore
cross
the
ocean
to
visit
his
cherished
cradle
of
liberty
baffled
by
political
difficulties
the
severity
of
the
climate
and
an
ungenerous
soil
he
abandoned
the
endeavor
that
his
motive
all
along
was
to
found
a
place
of
refuge
for
catholics
from
persecution
is
certain
from
the
time
and
circumstances
under
which
the
enterprise
was
undertaken
as
well
as
from
the
testimony
of
historians
oldmixon
says
gentleman
lord
baltimore
being
of
the
romish
religion
was
uneasy
at
home
and
had
the
same
reason
to
leave
the
kingdom
as
those
gentlemen
had
who
went
to
new
england
to
enjoy
the
liberty
of
his
bozman
writes
that
their
the
clamors
for
a
vigorous
execution
of
the
laws
against
papists
it
became
now
necessary
for
them
the
catholics
also
to
look
about
for
a
place
of
the
same
writer
also
refers
to
a
in
the
british
museum
written
by
lord
baltimore
himself
in
which
this
motive
is
mentioned
driven
from
avalon
by
the
hardness
of
the
climate
he
visited
virginia
with
the
same
view
but
hence
again
he
was
driven
by
religious
bigotry
and
the
presentation
of
an
oath
from
a
colony
which
the
careful
exclusion
of
roman
catholics
had
been
originally
avowed
as
a
special
his
mind
filled
with
the
thought
of
founding
a
place
of
refuge
for
catholics
next
turned
to
the
country
beyond
the
potomac
which
had
been
embraced
originally
in
the
virginia
charter
but
which
upon
the
cancellation
of
that
charter
had
reverted
to
the
crown
he
obtained
a
grant
and
charter
from
the
king
so
liberal
in
its
terms
that
griffith
says
it
became
the
model
for
future
grants
the
name
was
changed
from
crescentia
to
that
of
maryland
in
honor
of
the
catholic
queen
of
charles
but
the
devout
catholics
of
the
expedition
in
their
piety
extended
the
term
the
land
of
mary
into
an
act
of
devotion
and
honor
to
mary
the
queen
of
heaven
the
first
lord
baltimore
did
not
live
to
see
his
project
carried
into
effect
he
died
on
the
of
april
was
succeeded
by
his
son
cecilius
second
lord
baltimore
who
as
bancroft
says
was
the
heir
of
his
no
less
than
of
his
fortunes
to
him
was
issued
the
charter
negotiated
by
his
father
bearing
date
the
of
june
founded
by
a
catholic
designed
as
an
asylum
for
persecuted
catholics
is
it
to
be
supposed
that
lord
baltimore
and
his
brother
governor
leonard
calvert
who
organized
and
led
forth
the
pilgrims
would
be
so
inconsistent
at
this
moment
of
their
success
as
to
lose
sight
of
the
main
object
of
the
movement
and
carry
colonists
with
whom
to
found
a
colony
if
as
rev
edward
neill
author
of
not
a
catholic
says
there
were
only
twenty
catholic
gentlemen
in
the
ship
and
three
hundred
servants
mostly
protestants
would
it
have
been
deemed
necessary
to
carry
two
catholic
priests
and
their
assistants
along
to
administer
to
the
souls
of
so
small
a
number
in
point
of
fact
the
protestants
were
so
few
that
they
brought
no
minister
with
them
and
it
was
several
years
before
their
entire
numbers
justified
their
having
either
a
minister
or
a
place
of
worship
the
voyage
on
the
and
was
more
like
a
catholic
pilgrimage
than
a
secular
expedition
the
principal
parts
of
the
ship
the
says
father
white
in
his
were
committed
to
the
protection
of
god
especially
and
to
his
most
holy
mother
and
ignatius
and
all
the
guardian
angels
of
maryland
the
vessel
was
a
floating
chapel
an
ocean
shrine
of
catholic
faith
and
devotion
consecrated
by
the
unbloody
sacrifice
and
resounding
with
latin
litanies
its
safety
from
many
a
threatened
disaster
was
attributed
to
the
intercession
of
the
blessed
virgin
and
the
saints
whose
mediation
was
propitiated
by
votive
offerings
promised
and
promptly
rendered
after
their
safe
arrival
at
the
festivals
of
the
saints
were
faithfully
observed
throughout
the
voyage
the
feast
of
the
annunciation
of
the
blessed
virgin
was
selected
for
landing
and
the
solemn
act
of
taking
possession
was
according
to
the
catholic
form
father
white
thus
describes
the
scene
the
day
of
the
annunciation
of
the
most
holy
virgin
mary
march
in
the
year
we
celebrated
the
mass
for
the
first
time
on
this
island
this
had
never
been
done
before
in
this
part
of
the
world
after
we
had
completed
the
sacrifice
we
took
upon
our
shoulders
a
great
cross
which
we
had
hewn
out
of
a
tree
and
advancing
in
order
to
the
appointed
place
with
the
assistance
of
the
governor
and
his
associates
and
the
other
catholics
we
erected
a
trophy
to
christ
the
saviour
humbly
reciting
on
our
bended
knees
the
litanies
of
the
sacred
cross
with
great
they
founded
a
city
the
capital
of
the
colony
and
called
it
a
catholic
chapel
was
subsequently
erected
there
and
this
too
was
dedicated
to
mary
the
city
has
passed
away
but
the
little
chapel
still
stands
preserved
alike
by
catholic
and
protestant
hands
as
a
monument
of
the
faith
and
zeal
of
the
catholic
pilgrims
of
maryland
griffith
the
historian
uniting
his
voice
to
that
of
bancroft
and
other
writers
speaking
of
the
object
which
inspired
the
settlement
from
its
inception
by
lord
baltimore
in
england
says
of
respect
for
their
religion
they
planted
the
cross
and
after
fortifying
themselves
plainly
and
openly
set
about
to
obtain
by
the
fairest
means
in
their
power
other
property
and
homes
where
they
should
escape
the
persecutions
of
the
religious
and
political
reformers
of
their
native
country
at
that
the
church
and
parish
of
mary
were
for
many
years
the
headquarters
of
the
jesuit
missions
of
maryland
during
the
succeeding
years
prior
to
there
was
a
steady
influx
of
catholics
into
the
colony
from
england
as
is
evident
by
the
land
records
and
other
official
documents
and
by
the
fact
that
the
number
of
catholic
priests
required
for
the
settlement
increased
from
two
in
to
four
priests
and
one
coadjutor
prior
to
the
catholic
strength
was
also
increased
by
numerous
conversions
as
is
shown
by
father
in
which
at
page
he
relates
that
the
protestants
nearly
all
who
came
over
from
england
in
this
year
and
many
others
have
been
converted
to
the
faith
together
with
four
servants
and
five
mechanics
whom
we
have
in
the
meantime
won
to
so
numerous
were
these
conversions
and
they
created
so
great
a
sensation
in
england
that
measures
were
taken
there
to
check
them
that
the
colony
was
catholic
in
its
origin
and
so
continued
until
after
the
year
when
the
toleration
act
was
passed
has
never
been
denied
according
to
our
researches
except
by
gladstone
and
the
two
protestant
ministers
whom
he
quotes
bancroft
writing
of
the
religious
toleration
which
prevailed
in
maryland
during
this
period
always
speaks
of
it
as
the
work
of
catholics
in
referring
to
the
original
colonists
he
adds
of
them
roman
catholic
gentlemen
and
their
even
so
unfriendly
a
writer
as
bozman
says
most
if
not
all
of
them
were
chancellor
kent
speaks
of
the
colony
as
catholic
planters
of
maryland
and
judge
story
says
they
were
roman
father
white
in
his
speaks
of
the
few
protestants
on
board
the
as
individuals
and
not
as
a
class
bozman
alluding
to
the
year
and
to
in
whose
hands
the
government
of
the
province
was
says
majority
of
whom
were
without
doubt
catholics
as
well
as
much
the
greater
number
of
the
davis
a
protestant
who
drew
his
information
from
the
official
documents
of
the
colony
and
state
gives
unanswerable
proofs
of
the
fact
for
which
we
are
contending
we
give
a
single
passage
from
his
work
on
this
point
was
the
home
the
chosen
home
of
the
disciples
of
the
roman
church
the
fact
has
been
generally
received
it
is
sustained
by
the
tradition
of
two
hundred
years
and
by
volumes
of
unwritten
testimony
by
the
records
of
the
courts
by
the
proceedings
of
the
privy
council
by
the
trial
of
by
the
wills
and
inventories
by
the
and
and
by
the
very
names
originally
given
to
the
towns
and
to
the
creeks
and
rivulets
to
the
tracts
and
manors
of
the
county
the
state
itself
bears
the
name
of
a
roman
catholic
queen
of
the
six
of
this
small
county
in
five
had
the
prefix
of
sixty
tracts
and
manors
most
of
them
taken
up
at
a
very
early
period
bear
the
same
roman
catholic
mark
the
creeks
and
villages
to
this
day
attest
the
widespread
prevalence
of
the
same
tastes
sentiments
and
sympathies
not
long
after
the
passage
of
the
act
relating
to
the
protestants
it
is
admitted
outgrew
their
roman
catholic
brethren
and
in
succeeded
very
easily
in
their
attempt
to
overthrow
the
proprietary
but
judging
from
the
composition
of
the
juries
in
we
see
no
reason
to
believe
that
they
then
had
a
gladstone
seems
to
favor
the
view
that
religious
toleration
in
maryland
was
derived
from
the
charter
we
are
surprised
at
this
since
rev
edward
neill
whose
pamphlet
has
furnished
the
substance
of
the
entire
passage
we
have
quoted
from
says
in
his
not
a
roman
catholic
charter
of
maryland
granted
to
lord
baltimore
was
not
a
charter
of
religious
liberty
but
the
very
mcsherry
a
catholic
historian
says
that
ecclesiastical
laws
of
england
so
far
as
related
to
the
consecration
and
presentation
of
churches
and
chapels
were
extended
to
the
colony
but
the
question
of
state
religion
was
left
untouched
and
therefore
within
the
legislative
power
of
the
colonists
and
bozman
a
protestant
historian
adopts
the
same
view
of
the
charter
for
he
regards
the
for
church
passed
in
enacting
that
church
within
this
province
shall
have
all
her
rights
and
privileges
as
an
attempt
to
exercise
a
control
of
religion
and
says
can
not
but
suppose
that
it
was
the
intention
of
the
catholic
government
to
erect
a
hierarchy
with
an
ecclesiastical
jurisdiction
similar
to
the
ancient
church
of
england
before
the
reformation
and
to
invest
it
with
all
its
rights
liberties
and
the
same
views
are
expressed
by
the
same
author
at
pages
and
of
his
history
while
civil
liberty
was
guaranteed
by
the
charter
to
all
within
the
province
we
find
no
mention
of
religious
toleration
in
its
provisions
nor
do
we
find
that
immigration
was
made
free
by
the
charter
as
alleged
by
gladstone
the
provision
to
which
he
refers
simply
assures
to
the
subjects
of
england
or
to
be
transported
into
the
province
all
privileges
franchises
and
liberties
of
this
our
kingdom
of
england
but
the
decision
of
the
point
as
to
who
should
be
transplanted
or
admitted
to
settle
there
was
left
to
the
lord
proprietary
and
the
provincial
legislature
the
grant
by
the
king
to
lord
baltimore
of
all
the
lands
of
the
province
in
itself
gave
him
the
full
control
over
immigration
by
enabling
him
to
fix
the
conditions
to
the
grants
of
land
to
colonists
which
would
have
kept
out
all
except
such
as
the
lord
proprietary
wished
to
enter
we
think
we
have
shown
that
the
catholics
were
in
the
majority
during
the
whole
period
covered
by
our
discussion
and
that
the
charter
left
them
free
to
protect
themselves
from
intrusion
that
they
were
consequently
to
perpetuate
their
numerical
preponderance
and
control
of
the
government
why
had
they
not
the
same
motives
for
practising
intolerance
as
the
puritans
their
positions
respectively
and
relatively
were
the
same
in
this
particular
and
the
same
reasons
apply
to
both
no
they
were
actuated
by
a
different
spirit
and
guided
by
different
traditions
they
possessed
the
power
and
used
it
with
mercy
and
benevolence
not
only
permitting
but
inviting
christians
of
every
shade
of
opinion
to
settle
in
the
province
but
also
offering
grants
of
land
on
easy
terms
and
protecting
the
settlers
from
molestation
on
account
of
their
religion
if
they
had
not
the
power
to
proscribe
why
should
bancroft
griffith
chambers
kent
story
and
nearly
all
writers
on
the
subject
have
bestowed
such
encomiums
on
them
for
doing
what
they
could
not
have
refrained
from
doing
why
extol
the
toleration
enjoined
by
lord
baltimore
and
proclaimed
by
governor
leonard
calvert
and
the
subsequently
enacted
toleration
act
of
if
the
liberty
it
enacts
was
already
secured
by
the
charter
of
it
is
not
necessary
for
us
to
go
further
into
this
question
since
in
either
event
the
honor
and
credit
of
religious
toleration
in
maryland
is
due
to
a
catholic
source
if
the
charter
secured
it
our
answer
is
that
the
charter
itself
was
the
work
of
a
catholic
for
lord
baltimore
is
the
acknowledged
author
of
that
document
nature
of
the
document
itself
says
bancroft
concurrent
opinion
leave
no
doubt
that
it
was
penned
by
the
first
lord
baltimore
himself
although
it
was
finally
issued
for
the
benefit
of
his
was
prepared
by
lord
baltimore
himself
says
mcsherry
before
it
was
finally
executed
that
truly
great
and
good
man
died
and
the
patent
was
delivered
to
his
son
cecilius
who
succeeded
as
well
to
his
noble
designs
as
to
his
titles
and
it
will
be
more
than
sufficient
to
add
here
that
both
bozman
and
the
rev
ethan
allen
concede
that
lord
baltimore
was
the
author
of
the
charter
we
propose
now
to
show
that
the
religious
toleration
which
prevailed
in
maryland
had
its
origin
in
the
generosity
and
mercy
of
the
catholic
lord
proprietary
and
his
catholic
government
and
colony
of
maryland
was
practised
from
the
very
beginning
of
the
settlement
and
that
we
are
not
indebted
for
it
to
the
toleration
act
of
except
perhaps
as
a
measure
by
which
its
provisions
were
prolonged
toleration
was
the
course
adopted
in
organizing
the
maryland
colony
even
in
england
and
before
the
landing
of
the
pilgrims
thus
we
find
that
some
protestants
were
permitted
to
accompany
the
colonists
and
share
equal
rights
and
protection
with
their
catholic
associates
father
white
speaks
of
them
on
board
the
and
the
author
of
not
a
catholic
refers
to
the
fact
that
cornwallis
and
jerome
hawley
who
went
out
as
councillors
of
the
colony
were
adherents
of
the
church
of
england
as
evidence
in
part
that
maryland
was
a
catholic
we
take
the
same
fact
to
show
that
not
only
were
protestants
tolerated
in
the
colony
from
its
inception
but
were
liberally
and
generously
given
a
share
in
its
government
the
rev
ethan
allen
relates
a
succession
of
proofs
of
this
fact
though
not
for
that
purpose
in
the
following
passage
the
fact
of
so
large
a
portion
of
the
first
colonists
being
protestants
his
invitation
to
capt
fleet
his
invitation
to
the
puritan
colonists
of
massachusetts
to
come
and
reside
in
the
colony
in
his
constituting
stone
his
governor
in
who
was
a
protestant
and
was
to
bring
five
hundred
colonists

admitting
the
puritans
of
virginia
in
the
same
year
and
in
the
year
following
erecting
a
new
county
for
robert
brooke
a
puritan
and
his
mcsherry
says
speaking
of
the
act
of
possession
on
landing
in
the
cross
on
the
island
of
gathered
the
catholic
and
the
protestant

in
hand
friends
and
brothers
equal
in
civil
rights
and
secure
alike
in
the
free
and
full
enjoyment
of
either
creed
it
was
a
day
whose
memory
should
make
the
maryland
heart
bound
with
pride
and
the
same
author
says
that
the
toleration
act
of
was
passed
give
security
to
the
safeguards
which
lord
baltimore
already
bancroft
makes
religious
toleration
commence
from
the
first
landing
the
catholics
took
possession
and
extend
throughout
the
fourteen
years
up
to
the
passage
of
the
act
of
he
says
that
apologist
of
lord
baltimore
could
assert
that
his
government
in
conformity
with
his
strict
and
repeated
injunctions
had
given
disturbance
to
any
person
in
maryland
for
matter
of
the
rev
ethan
allen
relates
that
the
protestants
in
the
colony
were
allowed
to
have
their
own
chapel
and
to
conduct
therein
the
protestant
service
he
cites
a
case
in
which
a
catholic
was
severely
punished
for
abusive
language
towards
some
protestant
servants
in
respect
to
their
religion
and
remarks
that
settling
of
the
case
was
unquestionably
creditable
and
honorable
to
the
catholic
governor
and
davis
a
protestant
says
freedom
however
of
a
wider
sort
springs
forth
at
the
of
the
colony
not
demanded
by
that
the
charter
but
permitted
by
it
not
graven
upon
the
tables
of
stone
nor
written
upon
the
paper
of
the
but
conceived
in
the
very
bosom
of
the
proprietary
and
of
the
original
pilgrims
not
a
formal
or
constructive
kind
but
a
living
freedom
a
freedom
of
the
most
practical
sort
it
is
the
freedom
which
it
remained
for
them
and
for
them
alone
to
grant
or
a
freedom
embracing
within
its
range
and
protecting
under
its
banner
all
those
who
were
believers
in
jesus
again
the
same
author
writes
records
have
been
carefully
searched
no
case
of
persecution
occurred
during
the
administration
of
gov
leonard
calvert
from
the
foundation
of
the
settlement
at
to
the
year
langford
a
writer
contemporaneous
with
the
period
of
which
we
are
treating
in
his
of
confirms
the
result
of
investigation
of
the
records
the
protestants
of
the
colony
themselves
in
a
of
which
we
will
speak
again
attribute
the
religious
toleration
they
enjoyed
not
solely
to
the
toleration
act
but
also
to
other
strict
injunctions
and
declarations
of
his
said
lordship
for
that
purpose
made
and
gov
leonard
calvert
also
enjoined
the
same
by
a
proclamation
which
is
mentioned
by
numerous
historians
a
case
arising
under
this
proclamation
is
given
by
bozman
and
others
in
eleven
years
before
the
passage
of
the
toleration
act
capt
servants
who
were
protestants
were
lodged
under
the
same
roof
with
william
lewis
a
zealous
catholic
who
was
also
placed
in
charge
of
the
servants
entering
one
day
the
room
where
the
servants
were
reading
aloud
from
a
protestant
book
at
the
very
moment
the
protestants
were
reading
aloud
a
passage
to
the
effect
the
pope
was
antichrist
and
the
jesuits
were
ministers
supposing
that
the
passage
was
read
aloud
especially
for
him
to
hear
he
ordered
them
with
great
warmth
not
to
read
that
book
saying
that
was
a
falsehood
and
came
from
the
devil
as
all
lies
did
and
that
he
that
writ
it
was
an
instrument
of
the
devil
and
he
would
prove
it
and
that
all
protestant
ministers
were
ministers
of
the
all
the
parties
were
tried
before
the
governor
and
his
council
the
case
against
the
servants
was
postponed
for
further
testimony
but
lewis
the
catholic
was
condemned
to
pay
a
fine
of
five
hundred
pounds
of
tobacco
then
the
currency
of
the
colony
and
to
remain
in
the
custody
until
he
found
sufficient
sureties
in
the
future
bozman
thus
remarks
upon
this
decision
these
proceedings
took
place
before
the
highest
tribunal
of
the
province
composed
of
the
three
first
officers
in
the
government
they
amply
develop
the
course
of
conduct
with
respect
to
religion
which
those
in
whose
hands
the
government
of
the
province
was
placed
had
resolved
to
not
only
did
the
catholic
lord
proprietary
in
appoint
stone
a
protestant
to
be
the
governor
of
the
province
but
also
he
at
the
same
time
appointed
a
majority
of
the
privy
councillors
from
the
same
faith
we
will
close
our
testimony
on
this
point
with
the
official
oath
which
lord
baltimore
required
the
governor
and
the
privy
councillors
to
take
it
was
substantially
as
follows
will
not
by
myself
nor
any
person
directly
or
indirectly
trouble
molest
or
discountenance
any
person
whatsoever
in
said
province
professing
to
believe
in
jesus
christ
for
or
in
respect
to
his
or
her
religion
nor
in
his
or
her
free
exercise
we
can
not
determine
when
this
oath
began
to
be
used
bancroft
places
it
between
and
chalmers
hawks
and
others
give
the
time
as
between
and
it
is
certain
that
this
oath
was
prescribed
prior
to
the
passage
of
the
toleration
act
for
governor
stone
and
the
councillors
took
the
oath
in
and
there
is
reason
to
believe
that
it
was
in
use
at
a
much
earlier
period
referring
to
the
period
anterior
to
the
passage
of
the
toleration
act
bancroft
says
at
that
day
was
unsurpassed
for
happiness
and
liberty
conscience
was
without
davis
in
reference
to
this
subject
writes
toleration
which
prevailed
from
the
first
and
for
fifteen
years
later
was
formally
ratified
by
the
voice
of
the
in
view
of
the
subject
is
evidently
superficial
it
relates
exclusively
to
the
passage
of
the
toleration
act
and
was
conceived
and
published
without
the
knowledge
of
the
fact
which
we
have
demonstrated
that
the
toleration
for
which
the
catholics
of
maryland
have
been
so
much
praised
had
been
practised
for
fifteen
years
before
the
passage
of
that
act
surely
there
can
be
no
rival
claim
set
forth
in
behalf
of
protestants
for
the
period
we
have
mentioned
gladstone
sets
up
his
claim
for
the
protestants
under
that
act
we
can
not
admit
the
justice
or
truth
of
the
pretension
let
us
examine
it
this
law
enacted
that
one
professing
to
believe
in
jesus
christ
shall
be
troubled
molested
or
discountenanced
for
his
religion
or
the
free
exercise
thereof
nor
compelled
to
the
belief
or
exercise
of
any
other
religion
against
his
now
here
too
the
claim
set
up
by
gladstone
and
by
the
authors
of
the
pamphlets
he
quotes
is
met
by
stern
facts
in
the
first
place
the
toleration
act
of
was
the
work
of
a
catholic
it
was
prepared
in
england
by
lord
baltimore
himself
and
sent
over
to
the
assembly
with
other
proposed
laws
for
their
action
this
fact
is
related
by
nearly
all
writers
on
maryland
history
including
those
consulted
by
gladstone
except
the
writer
of
not
a
roman
catholic
who
does
not
refer
to
the
subject
except
to
claim
that
it
was
but
the
echo
of
a
previous
and
similar
order
of
the
english
house
of
commons
in
and
of
a
statute
passed
by
it
in
the
writer
even
intimates
that
the
rev
thomas
harrison
the
former
pastor
of
the
puritans
at
providence
afterward
annapolis
in
maryland
suggested
the
whole
matter
to
lord
baltimore
we
might
even
admit
this
pretension
without
impairing
the
catholic
claim
it
does
not
destroy
the
credit
due
to
the
catholics
of
maryland
in
passing
the
toleration
act
to
show
that
others
even
puritans
entertained
in
one
or
two
instances
similar
views
and
enacted
similar
measures
we
know
that
the
puritans
in
england
were
proscriptive
and
that
in
new
england
they
did
not
practise
the
toleration
of
maryland
even
if
lord
baltimore
had
the
measure
suggested
to
him
by
the
puritan
harrison
the
act
itself
when
adopted
by
him
and
put
in
practice
is
still
his
act
and
that
of
the
assembly
which
passed
it
it
remains
their
free
and
voluntary
performance
the
merit
which
attaches
to
the
good
deeds
of
men
is
not
destroyed
by
having
been
suggested
by
others
a
puritan
might
even
share
in
the
act
without
appropriating
the
whole
credit
to
himself
but
whatever
merit
is
claimed
for
the
puritans
in
these
measures
which
we
can
not
perceive
is
lost
by
their
subsequent
conduct
they
overturned
the
government
of
lord
baltimore
in
maryland
and
under
their
ascendency
catholics
were
persecuted
in
the
very
home
of
liberty
to
which
catholics
had
invited
the
puritans
but
of
the
existence
of
the
english
toleration
acts
mentioned
by
the
writer
referred
to
and
by
gladstone
we
have
been
supplied
with
no
proof
that
the
puritan
harrison
suggested
the
measure
to
lord
baltimore
is
hinted
at
not
roundly
asserted
certainly
not
sustained
by
proof
but
public
facts
give
the
negative
to
these
pretensions
the
toleration
act
of
was
the
immediate
echo
of
the
actual
toleration
which
under
the
injunctions
of
lord
baltimore
the
proclamation
of
governor
calvert
and
the
uniform
practice
of
the
colonists
had
long
become
the
common
law
of
the
colony
why
seek
in
the
turbulent
and
confused
proceedings
of
the
long
parliament
a
model
or
example
for
the
maryland
law
when
such
exemplar
is
supplied
nearer
home
by
the
colony
itself
from
its
first
inception
to
the
people
of
maryland
in
the
toleration
act
was
nothing
new
it
was
readily
and
unanimously
received
it
produced
no
change
in
the
constitution
of
the
province
toleration
was
not
the
law
or
the
practice
of
that
day
either
in
england
or
her
colonies
the
echo
was
too
remote
and
too
readily
drowned
by
the
din
of
persecution
and
of
strife
but
the
maryland
toleration
act
contains
intrinsic
evidence
of
a
purely
catholic
origin
the
clause
enforcing
the
honor
and
respect
due
to
blessed
virgin
mary
the
mother
of
our
saviour
which
we
have
already
quoted
gives
a
catholic
flavor
to
the
whole
statute
and
excludes
the
theory
of
parliamentary
or
puritanical
influence
in
originating
the
measure
the
claim
thus
set
up
is
also
against
the
concurrent
voice
of
history
which
with
great
accord
gives
the
authorship
of
the
law
to
lord
baltimore
who
as
he
had
enjoined
and
enforced
its
provisions
on
the
colony
for
fifteen
years
needed
no
assistance
in
reducing
them
to
the
form
of
a
statute
which
we
are
informed
he
did
but
who
were
the
lawgivers
of
and
what
was
their
religion
by
the
charter
the
power
was
vested
in
lord
baltimore
and
the
assembly
it
was
for
some
years
a
matter
of
contest
between
them
which
possessed
the
right
to
initiate
laws
the
lord
proprietary
however
finally
conceded
this
privilege
to
the
assembly
it
was
not
uncommon
for
the
assembly
to
reject
the
laws
first
sent
over
by
the
lord
proprietary
and
afterwards
to
bring
them
forward
themselves
and
pass
them
but
in
when
governor
stone
was
appointed
the
toleration
act
was
among
the
measures
sent
by
lord
baltimore
for
the
action
of
the
assembly
the
government
then
consisted
of
cecilius
lord
baltimore
a
catholic
without
whose
sanction
no
law
could
be
enacted
and
whose
signature
to
the
measure
in
question
was
given
the
following
year
the
journal
of
the
maryland
legislature
was
lost
or
destroyed
but
fortunately
a
fragment
of
it
is
preserved
consisting
of
a
report
from
the
financial
committee
of
the
assembly
and
the
action
of
that
body
on
the
bill
of
charges
with
this
document
and
the
aid
of
the
historical
facts
recorded
by
bozman
and
other
historians
we
are
enabled
to
ascertain
the
names
of
the
members
of
the
assembly
in
gov
stone
was
and
president
of
the
council
which
was
composed
of
thomas
green
john
price
john
pile
and
robert
vaughan
commissioned
by
the
lord
proprietary
and
the
remaining
councillors
were
robert
clarke
and
thomas
hatton
secretary
of
the
colony
members
of
the
council
the
other
members
of
the
assembly
were
the
representatives
of
the
freemen
or
burgesses
as
follows
cuthbert
fenwick
philip
conner
william
bretton
richard
browne
george
manners
richard
banks
john
maunsell
thomas
thornborough
and
walter
peake
nine
in
number
the
governor
councillors
and
burgesses
made
sixteen
in
all
but
as
pile
and
hatton
one
catholic
and
one
protestant
were
absent
the
votes
actually
cast
were
fourteen
on
the
memorable
occasion
in
question
the
councillors
and
burgesses
sat
in
one
and
as
such
passed
the
toleration
act
of
the
fourteen
thus
voting
green
clarke
fenwick
bretton
manners
maunsell
peake
and
thornborough
were
catholics
and
stone
price
vaughan
conner
banks
and
browne
were
protestants
the
catholics
were
eight
to
six
protestants
but
the
assembly
was
not
the
only
branch
of
the
government
the
executive
or
lord
proprietary
was
a
branch
and
without
his
no
law
could
pass
now
the
executive
was
a
catholic
and
a
majority
of
the
assembly
were
catholics
so
that
we
have
it
as
a
historical
fact
that
in
a
government
composed
of
two
branches
branches
of
the
which
enacted
the
toleration
act
it
is
an
important
fact
that
if
all
the
protestant
members
of
the
assembly
had
voted
against
the
law
the
catholic
majority
could
and
would
have
passed
it
and
the
catholic
executive
was
only
too
ready
to
sanction
his
own
measure
it
can
not
therefore
be
said
that
the
catholics
could
not
have
passed
the
law
without
the
protestant
votes
for
we
have
seen
that
both
of
the
branches
of
the
government
were
in
the
hands
of
the
catholics
waiving
however
the
division
of
the
government
into
two
branches
by
which
method
we
have
the
entire
government
catholic
and
regarding
the
lord
proprietary
merely
as
individual
computing
the
lawgivers
of
simply
numerically
we
have
the
following
result
lawgivers
of
lord
baltimore
stone
green
price
clarke
vaughan
fenwick
conner
bretton
banks
mr
manners
browne
maunsell
peake
thornborough
as
catholics
we
would
be
quite
content
with
this
showing
but
we
are
indebted
to
several
protestant
authors
more
impartial
than
gladstone
allen
and
neill
who
write
solely
in
the
interests
of
sect
for
a
computation
of
the
respective
catholic
and
protestant
votes
in
the
assembly
in
which
leaving
out
lord
baltimore
and
making
the
number
of
votes
fourteen
gives
according
to
their
just
and
strictly
legal
computation
catholic
votes
and
three
protestant
votes
for
the
act
of
davis
in
his
of
american
and
william
meade
addison
in
his
toleration
in
both
protestant
authors
take
this
view
and
enforce
it
with
strong
facts
and
cogent
reasonings
we
will
quote
a
passage
however
from
only
one
of
these
works
the
former
showing
their
views
and
the
method
by
which
they
arrive
at
the
respective
numbers
and
davis
writes
privy
councillors
were
all
of
them
as
well
as
the
governor
the
special
representatives
of
the
roman
catholic
proprietary
under
an
express
pledge
imposed
by
him
shortly
before
the
meeting
of
the
assembly
as
may
be
seen
by
the
official
oath
to
do
nothing
at
variance
with
the
religious
freedom
of
any
believer
in
christianity
and
removable
any
moment
at
his
pleasure
it
would
be
fairer
therefore
to
place
the
governor
and
the
four
privy
councillors
on
the
same
side
as
the
six
roman
catholic
burgesses
giving
browne
to
the
other
side
have
eleven
roman
catholic
against
three
protestant
we
think
however
that
if
the
computation
is
to
be
made
by
numbers
lord
baltimore
must
be
included
as
the
act
received
his
executive
approval
and
could
never
have
become
a
law
without
it
thus
according
to
the
views
of
davis
and
addison
with
this
amendment
by
us
the
numbers
would
stand
twelve
catholic
against
three
protestant
votes
but
we
prefer
taking
our
own
two
several
methods
of
computation
by
branches
of
the
government
showing
the
executive
lord
baltimore
none
the
assembly
and
that
estimated
by
numbers
counting
lord
baltimore
as
one
showing
catholics
protestants
this
surely
is
a
very
different
result
from
that
announced
by
gladstone
following
the
author
of
not
a
roman
catholic
sixteen
protestant
against
eight
catholic
votes
so
far
the
numbers
given
by
gladstone
and
the
writer
he
follows
are
mere
assertion
unsupported
by
authority
either
as
to
the
composition
of
the
assembly
or
the
respective
religious
beliefs
of
the
members
davis
however
gives
in
detail
every
name
and
refers
to
the
proof
by
which
he
arrives
at
their
names
and
number
and
the
same
testimony
is
open
we
presume
to
the
examination
of
all
in
order
that
there
may
be
no
lack
of
proof
as
to
the
religious
faiths
they
professed
he
gives
a
personal
sketch
of
each
member
of
the
assembly
in
and
proves
from
their
public
acts
their
deeds
of
conveyance
their
land
patents
their
last
wills
and
testaments
the
records
of
the
courts
that
those
named
by
him
as
catholics
were
incontestably
of
that
faith
the
population
of
the
colony
in
was
also
largely
catholic
beyond
dispute
we
have
already
shown
that
it
was
catholic
by
a
large
majority
during
the
fifteen
years
preceding
and
up
to
that
time
the
above
computations
showing
a
majority
of
the
legislature
to
be
catholic
strongly
indicates
the
complexion
of
the
religious
faith
of
their
constituents
up
to
the
catholic
county
was
the
only
county
in
the
state
and
kent
the
seat
of
the
protestant
population
was
only
a
of
kent
was
not
erected
into
a
county
until
the
year
the
toleration
act
was
passed
while
was
populous
and
catholic
kent
was
protestant
and
thinly
settled
there
were
six
in
all
catholic
except
perhaps
one
and
of
that
one
it
is
uncertain
whether
the
majority
was
catholic
or
protestant
the
population
of
kent
says
davis
small
in
if
not
many
years
later
she
was
but
a
of
county
in
she
paid
a
fifth
part
only
of
the
tax
and
did
not
hold
in
the
assembly
of
that
year
a
larger
ratio
of
political
power
that
also
was
before
the
return
we
may
suppose
of
all
the
roman
catholics
who
had
been
expelled
or
exported
from
by
capt
ingle
and
the
other
enemies
of
the
proprietary
in
she
had
but
one
delegate
while
was
represented
by
eight
and
this
year
she
paid
but
a
sixth
part
of
the
tax
and
for
many
years
after
as
well
as
before
this
assembly
there
is
no
evidence
whatever
of
a
division
of
the
island
of
kent
or
the
county
even
into
its
population
did
not
in
exceed
the
fifth
nor
in
the
sixth
part
of
the
whole
number
of
free
white
persons
in
the
after
a
thorough
examination
of
the
records
davis
arrives
at
the
conclusion
that
the
protestants
constituted
only
of
the
population
of
maryland
at
the
time
of
the
passage
of
the
toleration
act
in
his
investigations
must
have
been
careful
and
thorough
for
he
gives
the
sources
of
his
information
refers
to
and
and
cites
copiously
from
the
public
records
he
thinks
that
for
twenty
years
after
the
first
settlement
to
wit
about
the
year
the
catholics
were
in
the
majority
he
concludes
his
chapter
on
this
subject
with
the
following
passage
then
at
the
question
under
both
its
aspects
regarding
the
faith
either
of
the
delegates
or
of
those
whom
they
substantially
represented
we
can
not
but
award
the
chief
honor
to
the
members
of
the
roman
church
to
the
roman
catholic
freemen
of
maryland
is
justly
due
the
main
credit
arising
from
the
establishment
by
a
solemn
legislative
act
of
religious
freedom
for
all
believers
in
but
fortunately
we
have
another
document
at
hand
signed
in
the
most
solemn
manner
by
those
who
certainly
must
have
known
the
truth
of
the
case
as
they
were
the
contemporaries
witnesses
of
and
participators
in
the
very
events
of
which
we
are
treating
this
is
what
is
usually
known
as
the
protestant
made
the
year
after
the
passage
of
the
toleration
act
and
shortly
after
it
was
known
that
lord
baltimore
had
signed
the
act
and
made
it
the
law
of
the
land
this
important
document
is
an
outpouring
of
gratitude
from
the
protestants
of
the
colony
to
the
catholic
proprietary
for
the
religious
toleration
they
enjoyed
under
his
government
it
is
signed
by
gov
stone
the
privy
councillors
price
vaughan
and
hatton
all
of
whom
were
members
of
the
assembly
that
passed
the
toleration
act
by
all
the
protestant
burgesses
in
the
assembly
of
and
by
a
great
number
of
the
leading
protestants
of
the
colony
they
address
lord
baltimore
in
these
words
the
said
lieutenant
council
burgesses
and
other
inhabitants
above
mentioned
whose
names
are
hereunto
subscribed
do
declare
and
certify
to
all
persons
whom
it
may
concern
that
according
to
an
act
of
assembly
here
several
other
strict
injunctions
and
declarations
by
his
said
we
do
here
enjoy
all
fitting
and
convenient
freedom
and
liberty
in
the
exercise
of
our
religion
under
his
government
and
interest
and
that
none
of
us
are
anyways
troubled
or
molested
for
or
by
reason
thereof
within
his
said
this
important
document
is
dated
the
of
april
it
proves
that
the
religious
toleration
they
enjoyed
was
not
due
alone
to
the
act
of
but
to
the
uniform
policy
of
lord
baltimore
and
his
government
and
that
even
for
the
toleration
act
itself
which
had
recently
become
a
law
by
his
signature
they
were
indebted
to
a
catholic
comment
on
such
testimony
is
unnecessary
chancellor
kent
with
the
charter
the
public
policy
of
lord
baltimore
of
his
colonial
officers
and
colonists
and
the
toleration
act
of
all
submitted
to
his
broad
and
profound
judicial
inquiry
and
judgment
has
rendered
the
following
opinion
and
tribute
to
the
catholic
lawgivers
of
maryland
to
whom
he
attributes
the
merit
of
the
generous
policy
we
are
considering
legislature
had
already
in
declared
by
law
that
no
persons
professing
to
believe
in
jesus
christ
should
be
molested
in
respect
to
their
religion
or
in
the
free
exercise
thereof
or
compelled
to
the
belief
or
exercise
of
any
other
religion
against
their
consent
thus
in
the
words
of
a
learned
and
liberal
historian
of
the
rise
and
progress
of
the
united
the
catholic
planters
of
maryland
won
for
their
adopted
country
the
distinguished
praise
of
being
the
first
of
american
states
in
which
toleration
was
established
by
law
and
while
the
puritans
were
persecuting
their
protestant
brethren
in
new
england
and
episcopalians
retorting
the
same
severity
on
the
puritans
in
virginia
the
catholics
against
whom
the
others
were
combined
formed
in
maryland
a
sanctuary
where
all
might
worship
and
none
might
oppress
and
where
even
protestants
sought
refuge
from
protestant
catholics
have
written
comparatively
little
upon
this
subject
the
historians
of
maryland
have
been
chiefly
protestants
as
long
as
protestants
so
unanimously
accorded
to
the
catholic
founders
of
maryland
the
chief
credit
of
this
great
event
it
was
unnecessary
for
catholics
to
speak
in
their
own
behalf
it
has
remained
for
gladstone
and
the
two
sectarian
ministers
he
follows
to
attempt
to
mar
the
harmony
of
that
grateful
and
honorable
accord
of
the
protestant
world
by
which
catholic
maryland
received
from
the
united
voice
of
protestant
history
the
enviable
title
of
land
of
the
are
you
my
wife
by
the
author
of
before
the
war
thirteen
etc
chapter
xi
a
dinner
at
the
court
with
an
episode
crossing
from
the
station
to
his
brougham
sir
simon
saw
langrove
issuing
from
a
cottage
on
the
road
the
vicar
had
been
detained
later
than
he
foresaw
on
a
and
was
hurrying
home
to
dress
for
dinner
it
was
raining
sharply
sir
simon
hailed
him
i
give
you
a
lift
langrove
you
i
shall
be
very
glad
i
am
rather
late
as
it
and
they
got
into
the
brougham
together
how
wags
the
world
with
you
my
reverend
friend
souls
being
saved
in
great
numbers
eh
inquired
the
baronet
when
they
had
exchanged
their
friendly
greetings
i
am
thankful
not
to
have
the
counting
of
them
was
the
reply
with
a
shake
of
the
head
that
boded
ill
for
the
sanctification
of
dullerton
it
is
it
well
we
are
all
going
down
the
hill
together
there
is
some
comfort
in
that
but
how
about
miss
bulpit
her
port
wine
and
tracts
snatch
a
few
brands
from
the
burning
the
love
of
heaven
speak
to
me
of
her
i
beg
of
you
entreated
the
vicar
throwing
up
his
hands
deprecatingly
and
moved
from
the
placid
propriety
that
seemed
a
law
of
nature
to
him
i
had
good
news
to
report
of
her
so
cried
langrove
with
sudden
vivacity
not
going
to
marry
sparks
is
she
just
yet
but
the
next
best
thing
to
that
she
is
going
to
leave
the
mean
it
do
indeed
how
is
it
not
heard
of
it
before
been
pestering
anwyll
these
two
years
about
some
repairs
or
improvements
she
wants
done
in
her
house
crotchets
i
dare
say
that
would
have
to
be
pulled
to
pieces
for
the
next
tenant
he
has
always
politely
referred
her
to
his
agent
which
means
showing
her
to
the
door
but
at
last
she
threatened
to
leave
if
he
did
not
give
in
and
do
what
she
is
that
all
exclaimed
the
vicar
crestfallen
might
have
waited
a
little
before
i
hallooed
we
are
not
out
of
the
woods
yet
anwyll
is
sure
to
give
in
rather
than
let
her
of
the
sort
he
dislikes
the
old
lady
and
so
does
his
mother
and
so
particularly
does
your
venerable
of
rydal
rectory
i
met
anwyll
this
morning
at
the
club
and
he
told
me
he
had
made
up
his
mind
to
let
her
go
it
happens
luckily
for
you
i
suspect
that
he
has
a
tenant
in
view
to
take
her
place
come
now
cheer
up
is
not
that
good
news
excellent
said
the
vicar
emphatically
wonder
where
she
will
move
to
i
could
tell
you
that
too
she
is
in
treaty
with
charlton
for
a
dilapidated
old
hunting
lodge
of
his
in
the
middle
of
a
the
other
side
of
axmut
common
about
twenty
miles
the
other
side
of
moorlands
it
is
as
good
as
settled
i
believe
and
if
so
we
are
all
safe
from
you
do
surprise
me
exclaimed
langrove
his
countenance
expanding
into
a
breadth
of
satisfaction
that
was
absolutely
radiant
is
the
incumbent
of
axmut
let
me
see
he
said
musing
is
as
good
as
none
it
is
a
lonely
spot
with
no
church
within
ten
miles
i
believe
i
shrewdly
suspect
this
was
the
main
attraction
for
the
life
of
him
charlton
says
he
see
any
other
it
is
a
place
as
you
would
find
in
all
england
it
must
be
the
clear
coast
for
with
souls
as
she
calls
it
that
baited
her
there
is
a
community
of
over
a
hundred
poor
people
something
of
the
gypsy
sort
scattered
over
the
common
and
in
a
miserable
little
hamlet
they
call
the
village
so
she
may
preach
away
to
her
content
and
no
one
to
compete
or
interfere
with
her
but
the
blacksmith
who
rants
every
sunday
under
a
wooden
shed
or
on
a
tub
on
the
common
according
to
the
state
of
the
just
the
place
for
her
was
the
jubilant
remark
in
spite
of
the
pleasure
that
lit
up
his
features
usually
so
mild
and
inexpressive
sir
simon
looking
closely
at
the
vicar
thought
him
worn
and
aged
look
tired
langrove
you
are
overworked
or
else
miss
bulpit
has
been
too
much
for
you
which
is
it
he
said
kindly
little
of
both
perhaps
the
vicar
laughed
have
felt
the
recent
cold
a
good
deal
the
cold
always
pulls
me
down
be
all
right
when
the
spring
comes
round
and
hunts
the
rheumatism
out
of
my
bones
he
added
moving
his
arm
uncomfortably
ought
to
do
like
the
swallow
migrate
to
a
warm
climate
before
the
cold
sets
in
observed
sir
simon
else
dislodges
just
what
blink
was
saying
to
me
this
morning
he
urged
me
very
strongly
to
go
away
for
a
couple
of
months
now
to
get
out
of
the
way
of
the
east
winds
he
wants
me
to
take
a
trip
to
the
south
of
langrove
laughed
gently
as
he
said
this
why
you
i
afford
nonsense
take
it
first
and
afford
it
afterwards
my
very
convenient
maxim
for
you
but
not
so
practicable
for
an
incumbent
with
a
large
family
and
a
short
income
as
for
the
landlord
of
dullerton
said
langrove
the
baronet
winced
and
economy
are
all
very
well
he
replied
they
may
be
carried
too
far
your
health
is
worth
more
to
you
than
any
amount
of
money
if
you
want
the
change
you
should
take
it
and
pay
the
suppose
we
might
have
most
things
if
we
choose
to
take
them
on
those
terms
remarked
the
vicar
it
and
pay
the
price
says
the
poet
but
some
prices
are
too
high
for
any
value
who
would
do
my
work
while
i
was
off
looking
after
my
health
is
that
bourbonais
hurrying
up
the
hill
he
will
get
drenched
he
has
no
him
to
go
out
a
day
like
this
without
one
said
sir
simon
in
an
accent
of
fond
petulance
is
he
how
is
franceline
how
does
she
look
enough
if
she
were
my
child
i
should
be
very
uneasy
about
does
bourbonais
seem
uneasy
do
you
see
much
of
him
not
through
my
fault
nor
indeed
through
his
we
have
each
our
separate
work
and
these
winter
days
are
short
i
met
him
this
morning
coming
out
of
as
i
went
in
i
did
not
like
his
look
he
had
his
hat
pulled
over
his
eyes
and
when
i
spoke
to
him
he
answered
me
as
if
he
hardly
knew
who
i
was
or
what
he
was
you
did
not
ask
if
there
was
anything
amiss
said
sir
simon
in
a
tone
of
reproach
did
but
not
him
i
asked
what
did
he
say
and
the
baronet
bent
forward
for
the
answer
with
an
eager
look
very
definite
you
know
his
grandiloquent
vague
talk
but
he
said
something
about
hereditary
taint
on
the
lungs
and
i
gathered
that
he
thought
it
was
a
mistake
not
having
taken
her
to
a
warm
climate
immediately
after
that
accident
to
her
chest
but
whether
the
mistake
was
his
or
the
i
could
not
quite
see
i
imagine
from
what
he
said
that
there
was
a
money
difficulty
in
the
way
or
he
thought
there
was
and
did
not
perhaps
urge
the
point
as
strongly
as
he
otherwise
sir
simon
fell
back
on
the
cushions
muttering
some
impatient
exclamation
was
perhaps
a
case
where
the
maxim
of
it
first
and
afford
it
would
seem
justifiable
observed
langrove
course
it
was
but
bourbonais
is
such
an
unmanageable
fellow
in
those
things
the
strongest
necessity
will
never
extract
one
iota
of
a
sacrifice
of
principle
from
him
you
might
as
well
try
to
bend
has
always
given
me
the
idea
of
a
man
of
a
very
high
sense
of
honor
very
scrupulous
in
doing
what
he
considers
his
duty
said
langrove
is
he
is
assented
the
baronet
warmly
is
the
very
ideal
and
epitome
of
honor
and
high
principle
not
to
save
his
life
would
he
swerve
one
inch
from
the
straight
road
but
to
save
franceline
i
fancied
he
might
have
been
less
he
heaved
a
sigh
and
they
said
no
more
until
the
brougham
let
sir
simon
down
at
his
own
door
and
then
drove
on
to
take
langrove
to
the
vicarage
a
place
never
appears
so
attractive
as
when
we
look
at
it
for
the
last
time
an
indifferent
acquaintance
becomes
pathetic
when
seen
through
the
softening
medium
of
a
last
look
it
is
like
breaking
off
a
fraction
of
our
lives
snapping
a
link
that
can
never
be
joined
again
a
lodging
if
it
can
claim
one
sweet
or
sad
memory
with
our
passing
sojourn
there
wears
a
touching
aspect
when
we
come
to
say
with
the
certainty
that
we
shall
never
see
the
place
again
but
how
if
the
spot
has
been
the
cradle
of
our
childhood
the
home
of
our
fathers
for
generations
where
every
stone
is
like
a
monument
inscribed
with
sacred
and
dear
memories
sir
simon
was
not
a
sentimental
man
but
all
the
tenderness
common
to
good
affectionate
cultivated
natures
had
its
place
in
his
heart
he
had
always
loved
the
old
home
he
was
proud
of
it
as
one
of
the
finest
and
most
ancient
houses
of
his
class
in
england
he
admired
its
grand
and
noble
proportions
its
architectural
strength
and
beauty
and
he
had
the
reverence
for
it
that
every
man
feels
for
the
place
where
his
fathers
were
born
and
where
they
have
lived
and
died
but
never
had
the
lordly
gothic
mansion
looked
to
him
so
as
on
this
cold
january
evening
when
he
entered
it
in
all
human
probability
for
the
last
time
it
was
brilliantly
lighted
up
to
welcome
him
the
servants
men
and
women
were
assembled
in
the
hall
to
meet
him
it
was
one
of
those
patriarchal
customs
that
were
kept
up
at
the
court
where
so
many
other
old
customs
survived
unhappily
less
harmless
than
this
as
sir
simon
passed
through
the
two
rows
of
glad
respectful
faces
he
had
a
pleasant
word
for
all
as
if
his
heart
were
free
from
care
the
hall
was
a
sombre
apartment
that
needed
floods
of
light
to
dispel
its
oppressive
solemnity
it
was
filled
with
a
festal
breadth
of
light
the
great
chandelier
that
hung
from
the
groined
roof
was
in
a
blaze
while
the
bronze
figures
all
around
supported
clusters
of
lamps
that
gleamed
like
silver
balls
against
the
dark
wainscoting
the
and
library
which
opened
to
the
right
stood
open
and
displayed
a
brilliant
illumination
of
lamps
and
huge
fires
burned
hospitably
on
all
the
hearths
the
table
was
ready
spread
silver
and
crystal
shone
and
sparkled
on
the
snowy
damask
flowers
scented
the
air
as
in
a
garden
sir
simon
glanced
at
it
all
as
he
passed
could
it
be
that
he
was
going
to
leave
all
this
never
to
behold
it
again
it
seemed
impossible
that
it
could
be
true
as
he
stood
once
more
in
the
midst
of
his
household
gods
those
familiar
divinities
whose
gentle
power
he
had
never
fully
recognized
until
now
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
was
safe
there
was
an
unaccountable
sense
of
security
in
their
mere
presence
they
smiled
on
him
and
seemed
to
promise
protection
for
their
shrine
and
their
votary
the
baronet
went
straight
to
his
room
made
a
hasty
toilet
and
came
down
to
the
library
to
await
his
guests
he
was
in
hopes
that
raymond
would
have
come
before
the
others
and
that
they
might
have
a
little
talk
together
but
raymond
was
behind
them
all
everybody
was
assembled
the
dinner
was
waiting
and
he
had
not
yet
arrived
it
was
a
mere
chance
that
he
came
at
all
nothing
in
fact
but
the
dread
of
awakening
suspicions
had
withheld
him
from
sending
an
excuse
at
the
last
moment
but
that
dread
which
so
controlled
his
life
in
every
act
almost
in
every
thought
compelling
him
to
hide
his
feelings
under
a
mask
of
cheerfulness
when
his
heart
was
breaking
drove
him
out
to
join
the
it
was
all
true
what
langrove
had
said
there
had
been
a
return
of
the
spitting
of
blood
that
morning
very
slight
but
enough
to
frighten
angélique
and
hurry
her
off
with
her
charge
to
the
doctor
he
had
talked
vaguely
about
debility
nervous
system
unstrung
no
vital
mischief
so
far
the
lungs
were
safe
the
old
woman
was
soothed
and
went
home
resolved
to
do
what
was
to
be
done
without
alarming
her
master
or
telling
him
what
had
occurred
she
counted
however
without
miss
merrywig
that
pleasant
old
lady
happened
from
the
distance
to
see
them
coming
from
the
house
and
on
meeting
the
count
next
morning
asked
what
report
there
was
of
franceline
raymond
went
straight
to
ask
you
as
a
man
of
honor
to
tell
me
the
truth
he
said
is
a
matter
of
life
and
death
to
me
to
know
the
medical
man
answered
his
question
by
another
me
frankly
are
you
in
a
position
to
take
her
immediately
to
a
warm
climate
i
should
prefer
cairo
but
if
that
is
impossible
can
you
take
her
to
the
south
of
france
heart
stood
still
cairo
it
had
come
to
this
then
can
take
her
to
cairo
he
said
speaking
deliberately
after
a
silence
will
take
her
at
he
thought
of
sir
blank
check
he
would
make
use
of
it
he
would
save
his
child
at
least
he
would
keep
her
with
him
a
few
years
longer
did
you
not
tell
me
this
sooner
he
asked
in
a
tone
of
quick
resentment
did
not
believe
it
to
be
essential
i
thought
from
the
first
it
would
have
been
desirable
but
you
may
recollect
when
i
suggested
taking
her
even
to
the
south
of
france
your
daughter
opposed
the
idea
with
great
warmth
and
you
were
silent
i
inferred
that
there
was
some
insuperable
obstacle
in
the
way
and
that
it
would
have
been
cruel
as
well
as
useless
to
press
the
you
say
it
is
not
too
late
i
give
you
my
word
as
far
as
i
can
see
it
is
not
the
return
of
the
spitting
of
blood
is
a
serious
symptom
but
the
lungs
as
yet
are
perfectly
de
la
bourbonais
went
home
and
opened
the
drawer
where
he
kept
the
blank
check
not
with
the
idea
of
filling
it
up
there
and
then
he
must
consider
many
things
first
but
he
wanted
to
see
it
to
make
sure
it
was
not
a
dream
he
examined
it
attentively
and
replaced
it
in
the
drawer
a
gleam
of
satisfaction
broke
out
on
the
worn
anxious
face
but
it
vanished
quickly
his
eye
fell
on
sir
letter
of
the
day
before
he
snatched
it
up
and
read
it
through
again
a
new
and
horrible
light
was
breaking
on
him
sir
simon
was
a
ruined
man
he
was
going
to
be
turned
out
of
house
and
home
he
was
a
bankrupt
what
was
his
signature
worth
so
much
waste
paper
he
could
not
have
a
sixpence
at
his
or
anywhere
else
if
he
had
it
was
in
the
hands
of
the
creditors
who
were
to
seize
his
house
and
lands
did
he
give
it
to
me
he
must
have
known
it
was
worth
nothing
thought
raymond
his
eyes
wandering
over
the
letter
with
a
gaze
of
bewildered
misery
but
sir
simon
had
not
known
it
it
was
not
the
first
time
he
had
overdrawn
his
account
with
his
bankers
but
they
were
an
firm
good
tories
like
himself
the
harnesses
had
banked
with
them
from
time
immemorial
and
there
existed
between
them
and
their
clients
of
this
type
a
sort
of
adoption
if
sir
simon
was
in
temporary
want
of
ready
money
it
was
their
pleasure
as
much
as
their
business
to
accommodate
him
the
family
acres
were
broad
and
fat
sir
simon
was
on
friendly
but
not
on
confidential
terms
with
his
bankers
they
knew
nothing
of
the
swarm
of
leeches
that
were
fattening
on
those
family
acres
so
there
was
no
fear
in
their
minds
as
to
the
security
of
whatever
accommodation
he
might
ask
at
their
hands
when
sir
simon
signed
the
check
he
felt
certain
it
would
be
honored
for
any
amount
that
raymond
was
likely
to
fill
it
up
for
but
since
then
things
had
come
to
a
crisis
his
signature
was
now
worth
nothing
lady
rebecca
on
whose
timely
departure
from
this
world
of
care
he
had
counted
so
securely
as
the
means
of
staving
off
a
catastrophe
had
again
disappointed
him
and
the
evil
hour
so
long
dreaded
and
so
often
postponed
had
come
little
as
raymond
knew
of
financial
mysteries
he
was
too
intelligent
not
to
guess
that
a
man
on
the
eve
of
being
made
a
bankrupt
could
have
no
current
account
at
his
decree
was
then
the
of
his
child
raymond
buried
his
face
in
his
hands
in
an
agony
too
deep
for
tears
but
the
sound
of
step
on
the
stairs
roused
him
for
her
sake
he
must
even
now
look
cheerful
love
is
a
tyrant
that
allows
no
quarter
to
self
she
came
in
and
found
her
father
busy
writing
away
as
if
absorbed
in
his
work
she
knew
his
moods
evidently
he
did
not
want
her
just
now
she
would
not
disturb
him
but
drew
her
little
stool
to
the
chimney
corner
and
began
to
read
an
hour
passed
it
was
time
for
her
father
to
dress
for
dinner
but
still
the
sound
of
the
pen
scratching
the
paper
went
on
diligently
père
it
is
six
do
you
know
said
the
bright
silvery
voice
and
raymond
started
as
if
he
had
been
stung
late
is
it
then
i
must
be
off
at
and
he
hurried
away
to
dress
and
only
looked
in
to
kiss
her
as
he
ran
and
was
off
exclaimed
sir
simon
stretching
out
both
hands
and
clasping
his
cordially
have
kept
you
waiting
i
fear
the
fact
is
i
got
writing
and
forgot
the
hour
said
the
count
apologetically
dinner
was
announced
immediately
and
the
company
went
into
the
they
were
a
snug
number
seven
in
all
the
only
stranger
amongst
them
being
a
plover
who
happened
to
be
staying
at
moorlands
he
was
an
man
sallow
and
with
a
mouth
that
superficial
observers
would
have
called
firm
but
which
a
physiognomist
might
have
described
as
cruel
his
hair
was
dyed
his
teeth
were
false
a
shrunken
creature
whose
original
sap
and
verdure
if
he
ever
had
any
had
been
parched
up
by
the
fire
of
tropical
suns
he
had
spent
many
years
in
india
and
was
now
only
just
returned
from
palestine
what
he
had
been
doing
there
nobody
particularly
understood
he
talked
of
his
studies
in
geology
but
they
seemed
to
have
been
chiefly
confined
to
the
study
of
such
stones
as
had
a
value
in
the
general
market
he
had
a
large
collection
of
rubies
sapphires
and
diamonds
some
of
which
he
had
shown
to
charlton
and
excited
his
wonder
as
to
the
length
of
the
purse
that
could
afford
to
collect
such
costly
souvenirs
of
foreign
lands
simply
as
souvenirs
plover
had
met
his
host
accidentally
a
week
ago
and
discovered
that
he
and
the
father
of
the
latter
had
been
the
son
was
not
in
a
position
either
to
verify
or
disprove
the
assertion
but
plover
was
so
fresh
in
his
affectionate
recollection
of
his
old
that
young
heart
warmed
to
him
and
he
then
and
there
invited
him
down
to
moorlands
he
could
not
do
otherwise
than
ask
sir
simon
to
include
him
in
his
invitation
to
the
court
this
evening
but
he
did
it
reluctantly
he
was
rather
ashamed
of
his
pompous
friend
whose
transparent
faith
in
the
power
and
value
of
money
gave
a
dash
of
vulgarity
to
his
manners
which
was
heightened
by
contrast
with
the
simplicity
of
the
rest
of
the
company
he
had
not
been
ten
minutes
in
the
room
when
he
informed
them
that
he
meant
to
buy
an
estate
if
he
could
find
an
eligible
one
in
this
neighborhood
if
not
he
would
rent
the
first
that
was
to
be
had
on
a
long
lease
he
wanted
to
be
near
his
young
friend
charlton
sir
simon
was
extremely
civil
to
him
surprisingly
so
the
other
faces
we
know
langrove
bland
serious
mildly
exhilarated
just
now
like
a
man
suddenly
relieved
of
a
toothache
miss
bulpit
was
going
from
the
parish
charlton
running
his
turquois
ring
through
his
curly
light
hair
and
agreeing
with
everybody
all
round
lord
roxham
and
lively
sir
ponsonby
anwyll
a
pleasant
sample
of
the
english
squire
and
displaying
a
vast
amount
of
de
la
bourbonais
a
distinct
foreign
type
amidst
these
familiar
english
ones
the
face
furrowed
with
deep
lines
of
study
of
care
too
unmistakably
the
forehead
moulded
to
noble
thought
the
eyes
under
strong
projecting
black
brows
their
latent
fire
flashing
out
through
the
habitually
gentle
expression
when
he
grew
animated
he
was
never
a
talkative
man
in
society
and
he
was
more
silent
than
usual
but
no
one
noticed
this
not
even
sir
simon
he
was
too
much
absorbed
in
his
own
preoccupation
raymond
sat
opposite
him
as
his
doing
the
honors
of
one
side
of
the
hospitable
round
table
the
conversation
turned
at
first
on
generalities
and
current
events
the
presence
of
plover
instead
of
feeding
it
with
a
fresh
stream
seemed
to
check
the
flow
and
prevent
its
becoming
intimate
and
personal
sir
simon
felt
this
and
took
it
in
his
own
hands
and
kept
it
going
so
that
if
not
as
lively
as
usual
it
did
not
flag
raymond
looked
on
and
listened
in
amazement
was
letter
a
dream
and
would
this
supreme
crisis
vanish
as
lesser
ones
had
so
often
done
was
it
possible
that
a
man
could
be
so
gay
so
to
all
appearance
contented
and
unconcerned
on
the
very
brink
of
ruin
disgrace
beggary
banishment
all
in
a
word
that
to
a
man
of
the
character
and
position
constitute
existence
he
was
not
in
high
spirits
raymond
would
not
so
much
have
wondered
at
that
high
spirits
are
sometimes
artificial
people
get
them
up
by
stimulants
as
a
cloak
for
intense
depression
no
it
was
real
cheerfulness
and
gayety
was
there
any
secret
hope
bearing
him
up
to
account
for
the
strange
anomaly
raymond
could
speculate
on
this
in
the
midst
of
his
own
burning
anxiety
but
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
bitterness
mingled
with
his
sympathy
for
the
baronet
was
it
not
all
his
own
doing
this
disgrace
that
had
overtaken
him
he
had
been
an
unprincipled
spendthrift
all
his
life
and
now
the
punishment
had
come
and
was
swallowing
up
others
in
its
ruin
if
he
had
not
been
the
reckless
extravagant
man
that
he
was
he
might
at
this
moment
be
a
harbor
of
refuge
to
raymond
and
save
his
child
from
a
premature
death
but
he
was
powerless
to
help
any
one
this
is
what
his
slavish
human
respect
had
brought
himself
and
others
to
a
few
hundred
pounds
might
save
or
at
any
rate
prolong
for
perhaps
many
years
the
life
of
the
child
he
professed
to
love
as
his
own
and
he
had
not
them
to
give
he
had
squandered
his
splendid
patrimony
in
the
most
contemptible
vanity
in
selfish
indulgence
and
unprofitable
show
and
there
he
sat
a
piece
of
tinsel
glittering
like
true
gold
affable
jovial
as
if
care
were
a
hundred
miles
away
from
him
de
la
bourbonais
felt
as
if
he
were
in
a
dream
as
if
everything
were
unreal
everything
except
the
vulture
that
was
gnawing
silently
at
his
own
heart
the
conversation
grew
livelier
as
the
wine
went
round
plover
was
attending
carefully
to
his
dinner
and
was
content
to
let
others
do
the
most
of
the
talking
a
discussion
arose
as
to
a
case
of
something
very
like
perjury
that
a
magistrate
of
the
next
county
had
been
involved
in
some
were
warmly
defending
while
others
as
warmly
condemned
him
plover
suspended
the
diligence
of
his
knife
and
fork
to
join
with
the
latter
he
was
almost
aggressive
in
his
manner
of
contradicting
the
other
side
the
story
was
this
a
magistrate
had
to
judge
a
case
of
libel
where
the
accused
was
a
friend
of
his
own
who
had
saved
him
from
being
made
a
bankrupt
some
years
before
by
lending
him
a
large
sum
of
money
without
interest
or
security
the
evidence
broke
down
and
the
man
was
acquitted
it
transpired
however
a
few
days
later
that
the
magistrate
had
in
his
possession
at
the
time
of
the
trial
proof
positive
of
his
guilt
in
answer
to
this
charge
he
replied
that
the
evidence
in
question
had
come
to
his
knowledge
under
the
seal
of
confidence
that
he
was
therefore
bound
in
honor
not
only
not
to
divulge
it
but
to
ignore
its
existence
in
forming
his
judgment
on
the
case
the
statement
was
denied
and
it
was
affirmed
that
the
only
seal
which
bound
him
was
one
of
gratitude
and
that
he
was
otherwise
perfectly
free
to
make
use
of
his
information
to
condemn
the
accused
the
dispute
as
to
the
right
and
the
wrong
of
the
question
was
growing
hot
when
sir
ponsonby
anwyll
who
noticed
how
silent
raymond
was
called
out
to
him
across
the
table
what
do
you
say
count
should
say
that
gratitude
in
such
a
case
might
stand
in
the
place
of
a
verbal
promise
and
compel
the
judge
to
be
silent
replied
raymond
temptation
to
silence
was
very
strong
no
doubt
but
would
it
justify
him
in
pronouncing
an
acquittal
against
his
conscience
asked
langrove
was
not
against
his
conscience
replied
the
count
the
contrary
it
was
in
accordance
with
it
since
it
was
on
the
side
of
a
french
view
of
the
subject
said
plover
superciliously
showing
his
shining
teeth
through
his
moustache
i
were
a
criminal
commend
me
to
a
french
jury
but
if
innocent
give
me
an
english
one
has
perhaps
too
much
the
upper
hand
with
our
neighbors
observed
sir
simon
justice
is
none
the
worse
for
being
tempered
with
is
neither
here
nor
there
said
plover
is
justice
and
law
is
law
and
it
strikes
me
this
x
has
tampered
with
both
and
a
very
strange
thing
if
he
is
not
tabooed
as
a
perjurer
who
has
dodged
the
letter
of
the
law
and
escaped
the
hulks
but
whom
no
gentleman
ought
from
this
out
to
associate
come
that
is
rather
strong
language
said
langrove
must
not
outlaw
on
mere
inferential
evidence
a
man
who
has
borne
all
his
life
a
most
honorable
name
and
if
worse
comes
to
worst
we
must
remember
it
would
go
hard
with
the
best
of
us
to
put
a
social
brand
on
a
friend
that
we
were
deeply
indebted
to
if
we
could
by
any
possibility
find
a
loophole
of
escape
for
him
a
man
may
remain
strictly
honest
in
the
main
and
yet
not
be
heroic
enough
not
to
save
a
friend
on
a
to
be
sure
there
are
honest
men
and
honest
men
assented
plover
known
some
whose
moral
capacity
expanded
to
camels
when
expediency
demanded
the
feat
and
it
could
be
done
discreetly
astounding
what
some
of
these
honest
men
can
sir
simon
felt
what
this
speech
implied
of
impertinence
to
langrove
and
indeed
to
everybody
present
he
said
irrelevantly
is
your
glass
empty
bourbonais
are
you
passing
those
delectable
little
de
foie
raymond
helped
himself
mechanically
as
the
servant
presented
again
the
rejected
dish
would
be
a
nice
thing
to
define
exactly
the
theory
of
truth
and
its
precise
limits
observed
langrove
in
his
serious
sententious
way
addressing
himself
to
no
one
in
particular
should
begin
by
defining
the
nature
of
truth
i
suppose
said
plover
us
have
a
definition
from
our
host
if
you
are
going
in
for
metaphysics
i
hand
you
over
to
bourbonais
said
sir
simon
the
pair
of
them
in
hand
raymond
and
run
them
through
the
body
for
our
raymond
smiled
should
very
much
like
to
have
the
opinion
on
this
particular
point
of
metaphysics
or
morals
whichever
it
may
be
said
plover
you
believe
it
possible
for
a
man
to
effect
such
a
compromise
with
his
conscience
and
yet
be
as
our
reverend
friend
describes
him
a
blameless
and
upright
man
do
answered
de
la
bourbonais
with
quiet
emphasis
doubt
if
any
simple
incident
can
with
safety
be
taken
as
the
key
of
a
character
one
fault
for
instance
may
stand
out
in
his
life
and
color
it
with
dishonor
and
yet
be
a
far
less
trustworthy
index
to
his
real
nature
than
a
very
slight
fault
committed
deliberately
and
involving
no
consequences
we
are
more
deliberate
in
little
misdeeds
than
in
great
ones
when
a
man
commits
a
crime
he
is
not
always
a
free
agent
as
regards
the
command
of
his
moral
forces
there
are
generally
a
horde
of
external
influences
at
work
overpowering
his
choice
which
is
in
reality
his
individual
self
when
he
succumbs
to
this
pressure
from
without
we
can
not
therefore
logically
consider
him
as
the
sole
and
deliberate
architect
of
his
sin
hard
necessity
fear
of
disgrace
love
of
life
nay
some
generous
feeling
such
as
gratitude
or
pity
may
hurry
a
man
into
a
criminal
action
as
completely
at
variance
with
the
whole
of
his
previous
and
subsequent
life
as
would
be
the
act
of
a
christian
flinging
himself
out
of
the
window
in
a
fit
of
temporary
put
sneered
plover
we
were
to
follow
up
that
theory
we
might
find
it
necessary
on
investigation
to
raise
statues
to
our
forgers
and
murderers
instead
of
sending
them
to
the
hulks
and
the
opens
a
curious
train
of
thought
nevertheless
remarked
lord
roxham
fancy
it
would
be
a
very
profitable
one
to
pursue
said
plover
have
sometimes
considered
whether
it
may
not
on
given
occasions
be
justifiable
to
do
evil
i
mean
technically
evil
as
we
class
things
said
lord
roxham
instance
said
langrove
for
instance
put
it
mildly
to
convey
a
false
idea
of
facts
as
your
friend
x
seems
to
have
done
in
this
libel
business
i
suppose
there
are
cases
where
it
would
be
morally
justifiable
tell
a
lie
you
mean
that
is
a
startling
proposition
said
the
vicar
smiling
has
the
merit
of
originality
at
least
observed
plover
helping
himself
to
a
tumblerful
of
claret
afraid
it
boast
even
that
said
lord
roxham
is
only
an
old
sophism
rather
bluntly
should
like
to
hear
the
count
de
la
opinion
on
it
said
plover
rolling
the
decanter
across
to
his
antagonist
raymond
had
feigned
unconsciousness
of
the
insolent
tone
thus
far
though
he
had
detected
it
from
the
first
and
was
only
too
deeply
possessed
by
other
thoughts
to
resent
it
or
to
care
a
straw
for
what
this
stranger
or
any
human
being
thought
of
him
or
said
to
him
but
the
persistency
of
the
attack
forced
him
to
notice
it
at
last
if
not
to
repel
it
he
was
not
sufficiently
interested
in
the
thing
for
that
but
he
was
roused
from
the
kind
of
stinging
lethargy
in
which
he
had
hitherto
sat
there
nibbling
at
one
thing
or
another
oftener
playing
with
his
knife
and
fork
and
touching
nothing
he
laid
them
down
now
and
pushed
aside
his
glass
which
had
been
emptied
oftener
than
was
his
wont
mean
to
ask
he
said
according
to
our
low
french
code
of
morals
we
consider
it
justifiable
to
commit
a
crime
for
the
sake
of
some
good
to
ourselves
or
others
go
quite
that
length
replied
plover
i
assume
from
what
you
have
already
said
that
you
look
on
it
as
permissible
to
tell
a
lie
for
example
under
given
do
said
raymond
there
was
a
murmur
of
surprise
and
dissent
dear
bourbonais
you
are
joking
or
talking
for
the
mere
sake
of
argument
cried
sir
simon
forcing
a
laugh
but
he
looked
vexed
and
astonished
am
not
joking
nor
am
i
arguing
for
sake
protested
raymond
with
rising
warmth
say
and
i
am
prepared
to
prove
it
that
under
given
circumstances
we
are
justified
in
withholding
the
truth
in
telling
a
lie
if
you
like
that
way
of
putting
it
are
they
it
us
hear
several
spoke
together
excited
and
surprised
and
every
head
was
bent
towards
de
la
bourbonais
raymond
moved
his
spectacles
and
fixing
his
dark
gray
eyes
on
plover
as
the
one
who
had
directly
challenged
him
he
said
us
take
an
illustration
suppose
you
entrust
me
with
that
costly
diamond
ring
upon
your
finger
i
having
promised
on
my
oath
to
carry
it
to
a
certain
person
and
to
keep
its
possession
a
secret
we
will
suppose
that
your
life
and
your
honor
depend
on
its
being
delivered
at
its
destination
by
me
and
at
a
given
time
on
my
way
thither
i
meet
an
assassin
who
puts
his
pistol
to
my
breast
and
says
up
your
purse
and
a
diamond
which
i
understand
you
have
on
your
person
or
i
shoot
you
and
take
them
but
if
you
give
me
your
word
that
you
have
not
got
it
i
will
believe
you
and
let
you
am
i
not
justified
in
order
to
save
your
honor
and
life
and
my
own
in
answering
i
have
not
got
the
not
cried
plover
emphatically
bringing
his
jewelled
hand
down
on
the
table
with
a
crash
dear
sir
began
some
one
but
raymond
echoed
sharply
not
just
so
but
suppose
i
draw
my
pistol
and
shoot
the
robber
dead
on
the
spot
god
and
the
law
absolve
me
i
have
a
right
to
kill
any
man
who
threatens
my
life
or
my
property
or
that
of
my
have
undoubtedly
you
have
said
two
or
three
speaking
together
yet
homicide
is
a
greater
sin
than
a
lie
cried
raymond
he
was
flushed
and
excited
his
eye
sparkled
and
his
hand
trembled
as
he
pushed
the
glasses
farther
away
and
leaned
on
the
table
surveying
the
company
with
a
glance
that
had
something
of
triumph
and
something
of
defiance
in
it
done
bourbonais
cried
sir
simon
not
left
plover
an
inch
of
ground
to
stand
on
reasoned
said
langrove
with
a
dubious
movement
of
the
head
a
very
specious
bit
of
sophistry
said
plover
in
a
loud
voice
drowning
everybody
and
rousseau
and
the
rest
of
them
in
a
it
then
and
have
the
kernel
said
lord
roxham
he
was
growing
out
of
patience
with
the
dictatorial
tone
of
this
vulgar
man
so
chimed
in
charlton
airing
a
snowy
hand
and
signet
gem
and
falling
back
in
his
chair
with
the
air
of
a
man
wearied
with
hard
thinking
too
preposterous
to
answer
was
evasive
taunt
mere
very
compact
bit
of
casuistry
at
any
rate
said
sir
simon
with
friendly
pride
in
manifest
superiority
over
his
assembled
guests
strikes
me
it
would
take
more
than
our
combined
wits
to
answer
eat
my
head
before
answer
it
confessed
ponsonby
anwyll
who
shared
the
personal
complacency
in
the
superior
brain
but
raymond
had
lapsed
into
his
previous
silent
mood
and
sat
absently
toying
with
a
plate
of
bonbons
before
him
and
apparently
deaf
to
the
clashing
of
tongues
that
he
had
provoked
there
was
something
very
touching
in
his
look
in
the
air
of
gentle
dejection
that
pervaded
him
and
which
contrasted
strikingly
with
the
transient
warmth
he
had
displayed
while
speaking
sir
simon
noticed
it
and
it
smote
him
to
the
heart
for
the
first
time
this
evening
he
bethought
him
how
his
own
cheerfulness
must
strike
raymond
and
how
he
must
be
puzzled
to
account
for
it
he
promised
himself
the
pleasure
of
explaining
it
to
his
satisfaction
before
they
parted
but
meanwhile
it
gave
him
a
pang
to
think
of
the
iron
that
was
in
his
soul
though
it
was
part
of
his
pleasant
expectation
that
he
would
be
able
to
draw
it
out
and
pour
some
healing
balm
on
the
wound
he
would
show
him
why
he
had
borne
so
patiently
with
the
vulgar
pedagogue
who
had
permitted
himself
to
fail
at
least
by
insinuation
in
respect
to
de
la
bourbonais
the
pedagogue
meanwhile
seemed
bent
on
making
himself
disagreeable
to
the
inoffensive
foreigner
is
a
pity
x
was
not
able
to
secure
count
de
la
bourbonais
as
counsel
he
began
again
the
hands
of
so
skilful
a
casuist
his
backsliding
might
have
come
out
quite
in
a
heroic
light
it
would
have
been
traced
to
his
poverty
which
engendered
his
gratitude
and
so
on
until
we
had
a
verdict
that
would
have
been
virtually
a
glorification
of
impecuniosity
it
is
a
pity
we
have
missed
the
is
no
doubt
responsible
for
many
backslidings
said
raymond
bridling
imperceptibly
he
felt
the
sting
of
the
remark
as
addressed
to
him
by
the
rich
man
or
he
fancied
he
did
world
would
no
doubt
be
better
as
well
as
happier
if
riches
were
more
equally
divided
but
there
are
worse
things
in
the
world
than
poverty
for
all
is
the
excess
of
riches
which
is
infinitely
worse
a
more
unmitigated
source
of
evil
taking
it
all
in
all
said
langrove
said
for
a
professional
my
dear
sir
laughed
plover
you
find
many
outsiders
to
agree
with
you
i
by
outsiders
you
mean
turks
jews
and
hottentots
i
daresay
you
are
right
said
the
vicar
mean
every
sensible
man
who
is
not
bound
by
his
cloth
to
talk
cant
no
offence
i
use
the
word
technically
you
find
one
such
out
of
a
thousand
to
deny
that
riches
are
the
best
gift
of
heaven
the
one
that
can
buy
every
other
worth
having
love
and
devotion
into
the
rank
heresy
you
are
propounding
my
dear
sir
exclaimed
sir
simon
taking
a
pinch
from
his
enamelled
and
passing
it
on
will
not
find
one
sane
man
in
a
thousand
to
agree
with
you
i
though
what
do
you
say
count
agree
with
you
monsieur
said
raymond
with
a
certain
asperity
can
purchase
most
things
worth
having
but
i
deny
that
it
can
always
pay
for
there
we
have
the
sophist
again
it
can
buy
and
yet
it
pay
pray
explain
do
you
mean
raymond
said
sir
simon
darting
a
curious
puzzled
look
at
his
friend
is
very
simple
i
mean
that
money
may
sometimes
enable
us
to
confer
an
obligation
which
no
money
can
repay
we
may
for
instance
do
a
service
or
avert
a
sorrow
by
means
of
a
sum
of
money
and
thus
purchase
love
and
gratitude
things
which
plover
has
included
in
those
worth
having
and
which
money
can
not
pay
for
though
it
may
be
the
means
of
buying
the
look
that
accompanied
the
answer
said
more
to
sir
simon
than
the
words
conveyed
to
any
one
else
he
averted
his
eyes
quickly
and
was
all
at
once
horrified
to
discover
several
empty
glasses
round
the
table
they
were
at
dessert
now
have
you
tried
that
madeira
help
yourself
again
and
pass
it
on
here
will
you
i
shall
have
to
play
ganymede
and
go
round
pouring
out
the
nectar
to
you
like
so
many
gods
if
you
bestir
and
then
there
was
a
clinking
of
glasses
as
the
amber
and
ruby
liquid
was
poured
from
many
a
curious
flagon
into
the
glistening
crystal
cups
of
gods
a
eye
that
you
see
there
on
finger
observed
charlton
whose
azure
gem
was
quite
eclipsed
by
the
flashing
jewel
that
had
suggested
de
la
illustration
was
set
in
the
forehead
of
an
indian
idol
just
let
sir
simon
look
at
it
a
judge
of
precious
stones
said
the
young
man
who
felt
that
his
feeble
personality
gained
something
from
the
proximity
of
so
big
a
personage
and
was
anxious
to
show
him
off
the
latter
complacently
drew
the
ring
from
his
finger
and
tossed
it
over
to
his
host
it
was
a
large
white
diamond
of
the
purest
water
without
the
shadow
of
a
flaw
a
beauty
exclaimed
sir
simon
with
the
enthusiasm
of
a
connoisseur
too
good
to
be
worn
by
a
man
it
ought
to
have
gone
to
a
beautiful
woman
when
it
left
the
god
i
suppose
it
will
soon
eh
plover
plover
laughed
he
was
not
a
marrying
man
he
said
but
he
would
make
no
rash
vows
then
he
went
on
to
tell
about
other
precious
stones
in
his
possession
he
had
some
amazingly
sensational
stories
to
relate
concerning
them
and
how
he
became
possessed
of
them
we
generally
interest
others
when
we
get
on
a
subject
that
thoroughly
interests
ourselves
and
that
we
thoroughly
understand
plover
understood
a
great
deal
about
these
legendary
gems
and
the
celebrated
idols
in
which
they
had
figured
he
had
moreover
imbibed
a
certain
tinge
of
oriental
superstition
concerning
the
talismanic
properties
of
precious
gems
and
invested
them
perhaps
half
unconsciously
with
that
kind
of
prestige
that
is
not
very
far
off
from
worship
this
flavor
of
superstition
pierced
unawares
through
his
discourse
on
the
qualities
and
adventures
of
various
rubies
and
sapphires
that
had
played
stirring
parts
in
the
destinies
of
particular
gods
and
were
universally
believed
to
influence
for
good
or
evil
the
lives
of
mortals
who
became
possessed
of
them
the
company
began
to
find
him
less
disagreeable
as
he
went
on
they
did
not
quite
believe
in
him
but
when
a
amuses
us
we
are
not
apt
to
quarrel
with
him
for
using
a
privilege
and
drawing
the
long
bow
by
the
time
this
vein
was
exhausted
the
party
had
quite
forgiven
the
obnoxious
guest
and
admitted
him
within
the
sympathetic
ring
of
and
conviviality
de
la
bourbonais
had
become
unusually
talkative
and
contributed
his
full
share
to
the
ebb
and
flow
of
lively
repartee
he
was
generally
as
abstemious
as
an
anchorite
but
he
broke
through
his
ascetic
habits
and
filled
and
refilled
his
glass
many
times
it
was
deep
drinking
for
him
though
for
any
one
else
it
would
have
been
reckoned
moderate
before
the
dessert
was
long
on
the
table
the
effect
of
the
wine
was
visible
in
his
excited
manner
and
the
shrill
tone
of
his
voice
that
rose
high
and
sharp
above
the
others
in
a
way
that
was
quite
foreign
to
his
gentleness
sir
simon
saw
this
and
at
once
divined
the
cause
it
gave
him
a
new
pang
poor
raymond
driven
to
this
to
keep
his
misery
from
bursting
out
and
overwhelming
him
we
finish
our
cigars
here
or
in
the
library
asked
the
baronet
when
his
own
tired
limbs
suggested
that
a
change
of
posture
might
be
generally
agreeable
as
by
tacit
consent
the
chairs
were
all
pushed
back
and
everybody
rose
the
clock
in
the
hall
was
striking
ten
you
know
i
think
i
must
be
going
said
langrove
slips
quickly
by
in
pleasant
company
i
had
no
idea
it
was
so
late
you
are
not
going
to
leave
us
yet
protested
sir
simon
mind
the
clocks
here
on
they
said
the
vicar
and
innocently
pulled
out
his
watch
to
compare
it
with
the
loud
chime
that
was
still
trembling
in
the
air
i
see
your
wheels
are
five
minutes
slower
than
mine
he
said
with
a
nod
and
a
laugh
at
his
prevaricating
host
now
langrove
never
mind
the
time
were
made
for
slaves
you
know
come
in
and
have
another
cigar
urged
sir
simon
but
the
vicar
was
firm
i
may
as
well
go
with
you
said
de
la
bourbonais
late
already
for
me
to
be
sir
simon
was
beginning
to
protest
when
his
attention
was
called
away
by
lord
roxham
you
that
diamond
ring
harness
ring
no
i
passed
it
to
you
to
look
at
and
it
come
round
to
me
again
can
it
not
be
found
sure
to
turn
up
in
a
minute
said
plover
has
slipped
under
the
edge
of
a
plate
very
likely
and
he
went
to
the
table
and
began
to
look
for
it
let
us
be
going
as
we
are
going
said
de
la
bourbonais
to
the
vicar
and
he
went
towards
the
door
a
bit
replied
langrove
a
moment
bourbonais
we
must
see
the
end
of
have
we
to
see
in
it
it
is
no
concern
of
ours
was
the
slightly
impatient
rejoinder
raymond
was
in
that
state
of
unnatural
excitement
when
the
least
trifle
that
crosses
us
chafes
and
irritates
he
had
nothing
for
it
however
but
to
comply
with
the
fancy
and
wait
extraordinary
sir
simon
exclaimed
as
crystal
dishes
and
porcelain
plates
were
lifted
and
moved
and
silver
filigree
baskets
overturned
and
their
delicate
fruits
sent
rolling
in
every
direction
must
have
dropped
stand
aside
everybody
while
i
look
under
the
every
one
drew
off
sir
simon
flung
up
the
ends
of
the
snowy
cloth
and
taking
a
chandelier
with
several
lights
set
it
on
the
floor
and
began
carefully
to
examine
the
carpet
but
the
ring
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
it
is
here
it
is
certain
to
be
seen
he
said
still
bent
down
out
all
of
you
as
you
stand
you
may
see
it
flash
better
in
the
but
no
flash
was
anywhere
visible
the
discovered
nothing
brighter
than
the
subdued
colors
of
the
rich
persian
carpet
sir
simon
went
round
to
the
other
side
of
the
table
and
searched
with
the
same
care
and
the
same
result
are
not
an
absent
man
are
you
he
said
lifting
the
chandelier
from
the
ground
and
addressing
the
owner
of
the
missing
ring
are
not
capable
of
slipping
it
into
your
pocket
unawares
never
did
such
a
thing
in
my
life
but
that
is
no
reason
why
i
may
not
have
done
it
now
old
wine
sometimes
plays
the
deuce
with
one
said
plover
and
he
began
to
rummage
his
pockets
and
turn
their
contents
on
to
the
its
whiteness
threw
every
article
into
vivid
relief
but
there
was
no
ring
is
very
singular
very
extraordinary
indeed
said
sir
simon
in
a
sharp
tone
of
annoyance
any
one
hoaxing
charlton
not
playing
a
trick
on
us
are
you
should
i
play
such
a
stupid
trick
as
that
for
demanded
the
young
man
not
such
an
idiot
but
here
goes
let
us
have
my
pockets
on
the
table
too
and
following
his
example
he
turned
them
inside
out
coat
waistcoat
and
trousers
pockets
in
succession
but
no
ring
appeared
is
time
we
all
followed
suit
said
sir
simon
and
he
cleared
a
larger
space
by
sweeping
away
plates
and
glasses
am
given
to
absence
of
mind
myself
and
as
you
say
i
may
have
taken
a
glass
more
than
was
good
for
as
he
spoke
he
turned
out
one
pocket
after
another
with
no
other
result
than
to
show
the
solidity
and
unblemished
freshness
of
the
linings
there
was
not
a
slit
or
the
sign
of
one
anywhere
where
a
diamond
ring
or
a
diamond
without
a
ring
could
have
slipped
through
gentlemen
i
invite
you
all
to
follow
my
example
said
the
host
stepping
back
from
the
table
and
motioning
for
any
one
that
liked
to
advance
his
voice
had
a
ring
of
command
in
it
that
would
have
compelled
obedience
if
that
had
been
necessary
but
it
did
not
seem
to
be
so
one
after
another
the
guests
came
up
and
repeated
the
operation
while
the
owner
of
the
ring
watched
them
with
a
face
that
grew
darker
with
every
disappointment
langrove
and
de
la
bourbonais
were
standing
somewhat
apart
from
the
rest
near
the
door
and
were
now
the
only
two
that
remained
the
vicar
came
first
he
submitted
his
pockets
to
the
same
rigorous
scrutiny
and
with
the
same
result
a
strange
gleam
passed
over
features
as
he
turned
his
sallow
face
in
the
direction
of
de
la
bourbonais
suspicion
and
hope
had
now
narrowed
to
this
last
trial
raymond
did
not
move
on
bourbonais
i
have
done
said
langrove
consigning
his
spectacles
and
his
handkerchief
to
his
last
pocket
but
raymond
remained
immovable
as
if
he
were
glued
to
the
carpet
my
dear
friend
come
sir
simon
called
out
in
a
voice
that
was
meant
only
to
be
kind
and
encouraging
but
in
which
those
who
knew
its
tones
detected
a
nervous
note
will
not
said
the
count
in
a
sharp
high
key
will
not
submit
to
such
an
indignity
it
has
been
got
up
for
the
purpose
of
insulting
me
i
refuse
to
submit
to
it
he
turned
to
leave
the
room
you
are
mad
you
do
it
cried
sir
simon
imperatively
am
not
mad
i
am
poor
retorted
the
count
facing
round
and
darting
eyes
of
defiance
at
sir
simon
person
who
calls
himself
a
gentleman
has
insulted
me
from
the
moment
i
sat
down
to
table
with
him
and
you
allowed
him
to
do
it
he
taunted
me
with
my
poverty
he
would
make
out
now
that
because
i
am
poor
i
am
a
thief
i
have
borne
with
him
so
far
because
i
was
at
your
table
but
there
is
a
limit
to
what
i
will
bear
i
will
not
submit
to
the
outrage
he
wants
to
put
upon
again
he
turned
towards
the
door
shall
hand
out
my
ring
before
you
stir
from
here
my
fine
sir
cried
plover
taking
a
stride
after
him
and
stretching
out
an
arm
as
if
to
clutch
him
but
sir
simon
quick
as
thought
intercepted
him
by
laying
a
hand
on
the
outstretched
arm
while
ponsonby
anwyll
stepped
forward
and
placed
his
tall
broad
figure
like
a
bulwark
between
raymond
and
his
assailant
me
go
said
the
latter
shaking
himself
to
get
free
from
the
clasp
but
the
long
firm
fingers
closed
on
him
like
grim
death
shall
not
touch
de
la
bourbonais
in
my
presence
he
said
have
insulted
him
as
he
says
already
if
i
had
seen
that
he
detected
what
was
offensive
in
your
tone
and
manner
i
would
not
have
suffered
it
to
pass
stand
back
and
leave
me
to
deal
with
him
the
beggar
let
him
give
me
my
ring
i
want
to
touch
him
but
as
i
live
he
stir
from
this
room
till
seen
his
breeches
pocket
turned
out
the
man
had
been
drinking
heavily
and
though
he
was
still
to
all
intents
and
purposes
sober
this
excitement
added
to
that
caused
by
the
wine
heated
his
blood
to
he
looked
as
if
he
would
have
flown
at
raymond
but
cowed
by
sir
cool
and
determined
will
he
fell
back
a
step
fastening
his
eyes
on
raymond
with
a
savage
glare
raymond
meantime
continued
obstinate
and
impracticable
langrove
took
his
hand
in
both
his
and
in
the
gentlest
way
entreated
him
to
desist
from
his
suicidal
folly
assuring
him
that
he
was
the
last
man
present
whom
any
one
in
his
senses
would
dream
of
suspecting
of
a
theft
of
the
faintest
approach
to
anything
dishonorable
but
that
it
was
sheer
madness
to
refuse
to
clear
himself
in
the
eyes
of
this
stranger
it
was
a
mere
form
and
meant
no
more
for
him
than
for
the
rest
of
them
but
raymond
turned
a
deaf
ear
to
his
pleading
me
go
i
will
not
do
it
he
has
been
insulting
me
from
the
beginning
i
will
not
submit
to
this
he
repeated
and
shook
himself
free
from
friendly
grasp
sir
simon
came
close
up
to
him
he
was
pale
and
agitated
in
spite
of
his
affected
coolness
and
his
hand
shook
as
he
laid
it
on
shoulder
for
my
sake
for
sake
he
muttered
but
raymond
thrust
away
his
hand
and
said
with
bitter
scorn
i
am
a
beggar
and
so
i
must
be
a
thief
no
i
will
not
clear
myself
let
this
rich
man
go
and
proclaim
me
a
thief
and
breaking
away
from
them
all
he
dashed
out
of
the
room
stop
him
or
by
make
hot
work
of
it
for
you
shouted
plover
making
for
the
door
but
ponsonby
anwyll
set
his
back
to
it
and
defied
him
to
pass
if
the
other
had
been
brave
enough
to
try
it
would
have
been
a
hopeless
attempt
his
attenuated
body
was
no
match
for
the
stalwart
limbs
of
the
young
squire
he
involuntarily
recoiled
as
if
arms
stoutly
crossed
on
his
breast
had
dealt
him
a
blow
lord
roxham
and
charlton
pressed
round
him
expostulating
and
trying
to
calm
him
this
was
no
easy
task
and
they
knew
it
they
were
terribly
shaken
themselves
and
they
felt
that
it
was
absurd
to
expect
this
stranger
fuming
for
his
diamond
to
believe
that
de
la
bourbonais
had
not
taken
it
one
but
a
madman
would
have
done
such
a
thing
when
as
certain
as
death
to
be
found
out
said
sir
ponsonby
whose
faith
in
raymond
was
sustained
by
another
faith
we
all
know
no
more
capable
of
it
than
we
are
ourselves
fine
talk
but
where
is
the
ring
who
has
taken
it
if
not
this
frenchman
i
tell
you
what
he
will
be
making
out
that
it
was
his
right
and
his
duty
to
steal
from
a
rich
man
to
help
a
poor
one
perhaps
hard
up
just
now
and
he
blesses
providence
for
the
sir
that
you
are
speaking
of
a
gentleman
who
is
my
friend
and
whom
i
know
to
be
incapable
of
an
unworthy
action
said
sir
simon
in
a
stern
and
haughty
tone
compliment
you
on
your
friends
it
be
my
fault
if
you
see
this
one
at
the
hulks
before
long
but
curse
me
now
i
think
of
it
at
your
mercy
all
of
you
i
have
to
depend
on
you
as
witnesses
and
it
seems
the
fashion
in
these
parts
for
gentlemen
to
perjure
themselves
to
screen
a
friend
you
will
most
likely
refuse
to
swear
to
facts
if
you
swear
against
them
eh
must
be
drunk
you
know
what
talking
about
said
charlton
forgetting
to
drawl
and
speaking
quickly
like
a
sensible
man
is
as
premature
as
it
is
absurd
to
imagine
the
ring
is
stolen
it
must
be
in
the
room
and
it
must
be
the
room
or
out
of
it
it
must
and
it
shall
be
found
echoed
plover
if
not
it
shall
be
paid
for
added
charlton
shall
be
all
worth
could
not
buy
a
stone
like
that
one
its
duplicate
as
a
eye
invested
with
magical
virtue
said
charlton
ironically
its
value
in
the
market
can
be
paid
i
suppose
what
price
do
you
put
on
it
a
mere
stone
it
is
worth
five
hundred
pounds
to
any
jeweller
in
hundred
pounds
repeated
several
in
chorus
with
charlton
sir
simon
said
nothing
a
mist
came
before
his
eyes
he
saw
raymond
in
the
grip
of
this
cruel
man
and
he
was
powerless
to
release
him
if
the
dread
was
an
act
of
disloyalty
to
raymond
sir
simon
was
scarcely
to
blame
he
would
have
signed
away
five
years
of
his
life
that
moment
to
see
de
la
bourbonais
cleared
of
the
suspicion
that
he
had
so
insanely
fastened
on
himself
but
how
could
he
help
doubting
he
knew
as
no
one
else
knew
what
the
power
of
the
temptation
was
which
had
had
it
goaded
him
to
the
mad
act
its
madness
was
the
strongest
argument
against
its
possibility
to
pocket
a
ring
worth
five
hundred
pounds
worth
five
pounds
in
the
very
teeth
of
the
person
it
belonged
to
and
with
the
clear
certainty
of
being
immediately
detected
no
one
in
his
right
mind
would
have
done
such
a
thing
but
was
raymond
in
his
right
mind
when
he
did
it
had
he
been
in
his
right
mind
since
he
entered
the
house
there
is
such
a
thing
as
delirium
of
the
heart
from
sorrow
or
despair
then
he
had
been
drinking
a
great
deal
more
than
usual
and
wine
beguiles
men
to
acts
of
frenzy
unawares
if
sir
simon
could
even
say
to
this
man
will
pay
you
the
five
hundred
but
he
had
not
as
many
pence
to
call
his
own
there
had
been
a
momentary
silence
after
the
exclamation
of
surprise
that
followed
the
announcement
of
the
value
of
the
diamond
would
charlton
not
ratify
his
offer
to
pay
for
it
and
if
he
did
not
what
could
save
raymond
hundred
pounds
you
are
joking
said
the
young
man
see
whether
i
am
or
not
i
had
the
diamond
valued
with
several
others
at
vienna
where
it
was
set
said
plover
me
your
debtor
for
the
amount
said
sir
ponsonby
anwyll
stepping
forward
the
ring
is
not
found
i
will
sign
you
a
check
for
five
hundred
us
begin
and
look
for
it
in
good
earnest
said
lord
roxham
will
divide
two
will
go
at
each
side
of
the
table
and
hunt
for
it
thoroughly
it
must
have
rolled
somewhere
into
a
crevice
or
a
see
how
a
ring
was
likely
to
roll
on
this
said
plover
scratching
the
thick
pile
of
the
carpet
with
the
tip
of
his
boot
of
us
may
have
kicked
it
to
a
distance
in
pushing
back
our
chairs
suggested
langrove
us
set
the
lights
on
the
floor
and
divide
as
lord
roxham
every
one
seized
a
chandelier
or
a
lamp
and
set
it
on
the
floor
and
began
to
prosecute
the
search
they
had
hardly
been
two
minutes
thus
engaged
when
a
loud
ring
was
heard
and
after
a
momentary
delay
the
door
opened
and
de
la
bourbonais
walked
in
heavens
bourbonais
is
it
you
cried
sir
simon
rising
from
his
knees
and
hastening
to
meet
him
but
raymond
with
a
haughty
gesture
waved
him
off
they
were
all
on
their
feet
in
a
moment
full
of
wonder
and
expectation
made
a
mistake
in
refusing
to
submit
to
the
examination
you
asked
of
me
said
the
count
addressing
himself
to
all
collectively
was
wrong
to
listen
only
to
personal
indignation
in
the
matter
i
saw
only
a
poor
man
insulted
by
a
rich
one
i
have
come
back
to
repair
my
mistake
see
now
for
yourselves
and
if
you
like
examine
every
corner
of
my
he
advanced
to
the
table
intending
to
suit
the
action
to
the
words
when
a
burst
of
derisive
laughter
was
heard
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
it
was
from
plover
the
others
were
looking
on
silent
and
confounded
you
take
us
all
for
so
many
born
fools
cried
plover
and
he
laughed
again
a
short
contemptuous
laugh
that
went
through
veins
he
stood
there
his
right
hand
plunged
into
his
pocket
in
the
act
of
drawing
out
its
contents
but
arrested
by
the
sound
of
that
mocking
laugh
and
by
the
chill
silence
that
followed
he
cast
a
quick
questioning
glance
at
the
surrounding
faces
pity
surprise
regret
were
variously
depicted
there
but
neither
confidence
nor
congratulation
were
visible
anywhere
a
gleam
of
light
shot
suddenly
through
his
mind
he
drew
out
his
hand
and
passed
it
slowly
over
his
forehead
god
have
pity
on
me
he
murmured
almost
inaudibly
and
turned
away
listen
to
sir
simon
hurried
after
him
but
the
door
was
closed
raymond
was
gone
sir
simon
followed
into
the
hall
but
he
did
not
overtake
him
the
great
door
closed
with
a
bang
and
the
friend
he
loved
best
on
earth
was
beyond
his
hearing
rushing
wildly
on
in
the
darkness
and
under
the
rain
that
was
falling
in
torrents
the
apparition
had
come
and
gone
so
quickly
that
the
spectators
might
have
doubted
whether
they
had
not
dreamt
it
or
seen
a
ghost
no
one
spoke
until
plover
broke
out
with
a
hoarse
laugh
and
an
oath
the
fellow
has
not
half
convinced
me
of
his
innocence
too
great
a
fool
to
be
a
thief
he
has
been
proved
a
thief
you
will
be
good
enough
not
to
apply
the
term
to
monsieur
de
la
bourbonais
under
my
roof
said
sir
simon
gentlemen
we
will
resume
our
they
did
and
prosecuted
it
with
the
utmost
care
and
patience
for
more
than
an
hour
but
the
only
effect
was
to
fasten
suspicion
more
closely
on
the
absent
plover
was
so
triumphant
one
would
have
fancied
the
justification
of
his
vindictive
suspicion
was
a
compensation
for
the
loss
of
his
gem
you
a
pen
and
ink
here
or
shall
i
go
into
the
library
i
want
to
write
the
check
said
ponsonby
will
find
everything
you
want
in
the
library
said
sir
simon
and
ponsonby
went
in
some
one
rang
and
the
carriages
and
horses
were
ordered
in
a
few

let

give
you
a

you
no

you

this
probably
the

shall
ever

his
voice
trembled
a
little
and
his

were
touched
though
they
did
not

where
the

pointed

was
a

assent
from

hope
i
may
include
your

my
older

the

his

still
betraying
emotion

no
right
it
is
true
to
claim
such
an
act

i
know
he
added
with
a
faint
laugh
that
was
not
ironical
only
sad

that
it
is
a
comfort
to
us
all
to
talk
of
our
misfortunes
and
complain
of
them
to
sympathizing
acquaintances
but
i
appeal
to
you
as
a
gentleman
to
forego
that
satisfaction
in
order
to
save
me
from

he

held
out
his
fine
hand
to
his
guest
sir
simon
did
not
profess
to
be
a
very
deep
reader

the
most
accomplished

surer

he

done

his
shrivelled

with
awkward
bluntness
a
proof
of

tongue
in
private
life
but
you
expect
me
not

of

simon
started
is
pretty
certain
to
get
into
the
diamond
market
before
long
and
unless
the
police
are
put
on
the
watch
it
will
slip
out
of
the
country
most
likely
and
for
ever
beyond
my
reach
and
i
would
give
double
the
money
to
get
it
back
again

i
pledge
myself
not
to

the

to

bowed
another

was
gone

soon
the
noise
of

crushing

wet
gravel
died
away

left

many
other
unpleasant
things

continued
recollections
of
wordsworth
by
aubrey
de
vere
esq
part
i
it
was
about
eight
years
before
his
death
that
i
had
the
happiness
of
making
acquaintance
with
wordsworth
during
the
next
four
years
i
saw
a
good
deal
of
him
chiefly
among
his
own
mountains
and
besides
many
delightful
walks
with
him
i
had
the
great
honor
of
passing
some
days
under
his
roof
the
strongest
of
my
impressions
respecting
him
was
that
made
by
the
manly
simplicity
and
lofty
rectitude
which
characterized
him
in
one
of
his
later
sonnets
he
writes
of
himself
thus
a
man
who
long
had
served
the
it
was
because
he
was
a
true
man
that
he
was
a
true
poet
and
it
was
impossible
to
know
him
without
being
reminded
of
this
in
any
case
he
must
have
been
recognized
as
a
man
of
original
and
energetic
genius
but
it
was
his
strong
and
truthful
moral
nature
his
intellectual
sincerity
the
abiding
conscientiousness
of
his
imagination
so
to
speak
which
enabled
that
genius
to
do
its
great
work
and
bequeath
to
the
england
of
the
future
the
most
solid
mass
of
and
authentic
poetry
which
has
been
the
gift
to
her
of
any
poet
since
the
elizabethan
age
there
was
in
his
nature
a
veracity
which
had
it
not
been
combined
with
an
idealizing
imagination
not
less
remarkable
would
to
many
have
appeared
prosaic
yet
had
he
not
possessed
that
characteristic
the
products
of
his
imagination
would
have
lacked
reality
they
might
still
have
enunciated
a
deep
and
sound
philosophy
but
they
would
have
been
divested
of
that
human
interest
which
belongs
to
them
in
a
yet
higher
degree
all
the
little
incidents
of
the
neighborhood
were
to
him
important
the
veracity
and
the
ideality
which
are
so
signally
combined
in
poetic
descriptions
of
nature
made
themselves
at
least
as
much
felt
whenever
nature
was
the
theme
of
his
discourse
in
his
intense
reverence
for
nature
he
regarded
all
poetical
delineations
of
her
with
an
exacting
severity
and
if
the
descriptions
were
not
true
and
true
in
a
twofold
sense
the
more
skilfully
executed
they
were
the
more
was
his
indignation
roused
by
what
he
deemed
a
pretence
and
a
deceit
an
untrue
description
of
nature
was
to
him
a
profaneness
a
heavenly
message
sophisticated
and
falsely
delivered
he
expatiated
much
to
me
one
day
as
we
walked
among
the
hills
above
grasmere
on
the
mode
in
which
nature
had
been
described
by
one
of
the
most
justly
popular
of
modern
poets
one
for
whom
he
preserved
a
high
and
affectionate
respect
took
pains
wordsworth
said
went
out
with
his
pencil
and
and
jotted
down
whatever
struck
him
most
a
river
rippling
over
the
sands
a
ruined
tower
on
a
rock
above
it
a
promontory
and
a
mountain
ash
waving
its
red
berries
he
went
home
and
wove
the
whole
together
into
a
poetical
after
a
pause
wordsworth
resumed
with
a
flashing
eye
and
impassioned
voice
nature
does
not
permit
an
inventory
to
be
made
of
her
charms
he
should
have
left
his
pencil
and
at
home
fixed
his
eye
as
he
walked
with
a
reverent
attention
on
all
that
surrounded
him
and
taken
all
into
a
heart
that
could
understand
and
enjoy
then
after
several
days
had
passed
by
he
should
have
interrogated
his
memory
as
to
the
scene
he
would
have
discovered
that
while
much
of
what
he
had
admired
was
preserved
to
him
much
was
also
most
wisely
obliterated
that
which
remained
the
picture
surviving
in
his
mind
would
have
presented
the
ideal
and
essential
truth
of
the
scene
and
done
so
in
a
large
part
by
discarding
much
which
though
in
itself
striking
was
not
characteristic
in
every
scene
many
of
the
most
brilliant
details
are
but
accidental
a
true
eye
for
nature
does
not
note
them
or
at
least
does
not
dwell
on
on
the
same
occasion
he
remarked
misquoted
in
one
of
his
novels
my
lines
on
yarrow
he
makes
me
write
swans
on
sweet
lake
float
double
swans
and
but
i
wrote
on
could
i
have
written
in
the
plural
the
scene
when
i
saw
it
with
its
still
and
dim
lake
under
the
dusky
hills
was
one
of
utter
loneliness
there
was
swan
and
one
only
stemming
the
water
and
the
pathetic
loneliness
of
the
region
gave
importance
to
the
one
companion
of
that
swan
its
own
white
image
in
the
water
it
was
for
that
reason
that
i
recorded
the
swan
and
the
shadow
had
there
been
many
swans
and
many
shadows
they
would
have
implied
nothing
as
regards
the
character
of
the
scene
and
i
should
have
said
nothing
about
he
proceeded
to
remark
that
many
who
could
descant
with
eloquence
on
nature
cared
little
for
her
and
that
many
more
who
truly
loved
her
had
yet
no
eye
to
discern
her
which
he
regarded
as
a
sort
of
he
continued
i
have
hardly
ever
known
any
one
but
myself
who
had
a
true
eye
for
nature
one
that
thoroughly
understood
her
meanings
and
her
teachings
here
he
interrupted
himself
person
there
was
a
young
clergyman
called
frederick
faber
who
resided
at
ambleside
he
had
not
only
as
good
an
eye
for
nature
as
i
have
but
even
a
better
one
and
sometimes
pointed
out
to
me
on
the
mountains
effects
which
with
all
my
great
experience
i
had
never
truth
he
used
to
say
that
is
truth
in
its
largest
sense
as
a
thing
at
once
real
and
ideal
a
truth
including
exact
and
accurate
detail
and
yet
everywhere
subordinating
mere
detail
to
the
spirit
of
the
whole
this
he
affirmed
was
the
soul
and
essence
not
only
of
descriptive
poetry
but
of
all
poetry
he
had
often
he
told
me
intended
to
write
an
essay
on
poetry
setting
forth
this
principle
and
illustrating
it
by
references
to
the
chief
representatives
of
poetry
in
its
various
departments
it
was
this
twofold
truth
which
made
shakspere
the
greatest
of
all
poets
was
well
for
shakspere
he
remarked
he
gave
himself
to
the
drama
it
was
that
which
forced
him
to
be
sufficiently
human
his
poems
would
otherwise
from
the
extraordinarily
metaphysical
character
of
his
genius
have
been
too
recondite
to
be
understood
his
youthful
poems
in
spite
of
their
unfortunate
and
unworthy
subjects
and
his
sonnets
also
reveal
this
tendency
nothing
can
surpass
the
greatness
of
shakspere
where
he
is
at
his
greatest
but
it
is
wrong
to
speak
of
him
as
if
even
he
were
perfect
he
had
serious
defects
and
not
those
only
proceeding
from
carelessness
for
instance
in
his
delineations
of
character
he
does
not
assign
as
large
a
place
to
religious
sentiment
as
enters
into
the
constitution
of
human
nature
under
normal
circumstances
if
his
dramas
had
more
religion
in
them
they
would
be
truer
representations
of
man
as
well
as
more
elevated
and
of
a
more
searching
wordsworth
used
to
warn
young
poets
against
writing
poetry
remote
from
human
interest
dante
he
admitted
to
be
an
exception
but
he
considered
that
shelley
and
almost
all
others
who
had
endeavored
to
outsoar
the
humanities
had
suffered
deplorably
from
the
attempt
i
once
heard
him
say
have
often
been
asked
for
advice
by
young
poets
all
the
advice
i
can
give
may
be
expressed
in
two
counsels
first
let
nature
be
your
habitual
and
pleasurable
study
human
nature
and
material
nature
secondly
study
carefully
those
poets
whose
fame
is
universal
not
local
and
learn
from
them
learn
from
them
especially
how
to
observe
and
how
to
interpret
those
who
knew
wordsworth
only
from
his
poetry
might
have
supposed
that
he
dwelt
ever
in
a
region
too
serene
to
admit
of
human
agitations
this
was
not
the
fact
there
was
in
his
being
a
region
of
tumult
as
well
a
higher
region
of
calm
though
it
was
almost
wholly
in
the
latter
that
his
poetry
lived
it
turned
aside
from
mere
excitements
and
for
that
reason
doubtless
it
developed
more
deeply
those
special
ardors
which
belong
at
once
to
the
higher
imagination
and
to
the
moral
being
the
passion
which
was
suppressed
elsewhere
burned
in
his
to
liberty
and
added
a
deeper
sadness
to
the
of
but
his
heart
as
well
as
his
imagination
was
ardent
when
it
spoke
most
powerfully
in
his
poetry
it
spoke
with
a
stern
brevity
unusual
in
that
poetry
as
in
the
poem
is
a
change
and
i
am
poor
and
the
still
more
remarkable
one
slumber
did
my
spirit
a
poem
impassioned
beyond
the
comprehension
of
those
who
fancy
that
wordsworth
lacks
passion
merely
because
in
him
passion
is
neither
declamatory
nor
latently
sensual
he
was
a
man
of
strong
affections
strong
enough
on
one
sorrowful
occasion
to
withdraw
him
for
a
time
from
poetry
referring
once
to
two
young
children
of
his
who
had
died
about
forty
years
previously
he
described
the
details
of
their
illnesses
with
an
exactness
and
an
impetuosity
of
troubled
excitement
such
as
might
have
been
expected
if
the
bereavement
had
taken
place
but
a
few
weeks
before
the
lapse
of
time
appeared
to
have
left
the
sorrow
submerged
indeed
but
still
in
all
its
first
freshness
yet
i
afterwards
heard
that
at
the
time
of
the
illness
at
least
in
the
case
of
one
of
the
two
children
it
was
impossible
to
rouse
his
attention
to
the
danger
he
chanced
to
be
then
under
the
immediate
spell
of
one
of
those
fits
of
poetic
inspiration
which
descended
on
him
like
a
cloud
till
the
cloud
had
drifted
he
could
see
nothing
beyond
under
the
level
of
the
calm
there
was
however
the
precinct
of
the
storm
it
expressed
itself
rarely
but
vehemently
partaking
sometimes
of
the
character
both
of
indignation
and
sorrow
all
at
once
the
trouble
would
pass
away
and
his
countenance
bask
in
its
habitual
calm
like
a
cloudless
summer
sky
his
indignation
flamed
out
vehemently
when
he
heard
of
a
base
action
could
kick
such
a
man
across
england
with
my
naked
foot
i
heard
him
exclaim
on
such
an
occasion
the
more
impassioned
part
of
his
nature
connected
itself
especially
with
his
political
feelings
he
regarded
his
own
intellect
as
one
which
united
some
of
the
faculties
which
belong
to
the
statesman
with
those
which
belong
to
the
poet
and
public
affairs
interested
him
not
less
deeply
than
poetry
it
was
as
patriot
not
poet
that
he
ventured
to
claim
fellowship
with
dante
he
did
not
accept
the
term
because
it
implied
an
organic
change
in
our
institutions
and
this
he
deemed
both
needless
and
dangerous
but
he
used
to
say
that
while
he
was
a
decided
conservative
he
remembered
that
to
preserve
our
institutions
we
must
be
ever
improving
them
he
was
indeed
from
first
to
last
a
patriot
an
impassioned
as
well
as
a
thoughtful
one
yet
his
political
sympathies
were
not
with
his
own
country
only
but
with
the
progress
of
humanity
till
disenchanted
by
the
excesses
and
follies
of
the
first
french
revolution
his
hopes
and
sympathies
associated
themselves
ardently
with
the
new
order
of
things
created
by
it
and
i
have
heard
him
say
that
he
did
not
know
how
any
man
entering
on
life
at
the
time
of
that
great
uprising
could
have
escaped
the
illusion
to
the
end
his
sympathies
were
ever
with
the
cottage
hearth
far
more
than
with
the
palace
if
he
became
a
strong
supporter
of
what
has
been
called
hierarchy
of
society
it
was
chiefly
because
he
believed
the
principle
of
to
be
fatal
to
the
and
the
true
dignity
of
the
poor
moreover
in
siding
politically
with
the
crown
and
the
coronets
he
considered
himself
to
be
siding
with
the
weaker
party
in
our
democratic
days
the
absence
of
in
works
has
often
been
remarked
upon
and
indeed
brought
as
a
charge
against
them
he
once
told
me
that
if
he
had
avoided
that
form
of
composition
it
was
by
no
means
because
the
theme
did
not
interest
him
but
because
treated
as
it
commonly
has
been
it
tends
rather
to
disturb
and
lower
the
moral
and
imaginative
being
than
to
elevate
it
he
feared
to
handle
it
amiss
he
seemed
to
think
that
the
subject
had
been
so
long
vulgarized
that
few
poets
had
a
right
to
assume
that
they
could
treat
it
worthily
especially
as
the
theme
when
treated
unworthily
was
such
an
easy
and
cheap
way
of
winning
applause
it
has
been
observed
also
that
the
religion
of
poetry
at
least
of
his
earlier
poetry
is
not
as
distinctly
as
might
have
been
expected
from
this
adherence
to
what
he
has
called
emphatically
lord
and
mighty
paramount
of
he
once
remarked
to
me
himself
on
this
circumstance
and
explained
it
by
stating
that
when
in
youth
his
imagination
was
shaping
for
itself
the
channel
in
which
it
was
to
flow
his
religious
convictions
were
less
definite
and
less
strong
than
they
had
become
on
more
mature
thought
and
that
when
his
poetic
mind
and
manner
had
once
been
formed
he
feared
that
he
might
in
attempting
to
modify
them
have
become
constrained
he
added
that
on
such
matters
he
ever
wrote
with
great
diffidence
remembering
that
if
there
were
many
subjects
too
low
for
song
there
were
some
too
high
general
confidence
in
his
own
powers
which
was
strong
though
far
from
exaggerated
rendered
more
striking
and
more
touching
his
humility
in
all
that
concerned
religion
it
used
to
remind
me
of
what
i
once
heard
rogers
say
viz
is
a
special
character
of
about
humility
for
it
implies
that
a
man
can
in
an
unusual
degree
estimate
the
of
what
is
above
fortunately
his
diffidence
did
not
keep
wordsworth
silent
on
sacred
themes
his
later
poems
include
an
unequivocal
as
well
as
beautiful
confession
of
christian
faith
and
one
of
them
primrose
of
the
rock
is
as
distinctly
wordsworthian
in
its
inspiration
as
it
is
christian
in
its
doctrine
wordsworth
was
a
and
also
in
his
prose
mind
strongly
catholic
partly
on
political
grounds
but
that
it
was
otherwise
as
regards
his
mind
poetic
is
obvious
from
many
passages
in
his
christian
poetry
especially
those
which
refer
to
the
monastic
system
and
the
schoolmen
and
his
sonnet
on
the
blessed
virgin
whom
he
addresses
as
tainted
solitary
he
used
to
say
that
the
idea
of
one
who
was
both
virgin
and
mother
had
sunk
so
deep
into
the
heart
of
humanity
that
there
it
must
ever
remain
estimate
of
his
contemporaries
was
not
generally
high
i
remember
his
once
saying
to
me
have
known
many
that
might
be
called
very
men
and
a
good
many
of
real
and
vigorous
but
few
of
genius
and
only
one
whom
i
should
call
that
one
was
coleridge
at
any
hour
of
the
day
or
night
he
would
talk
by
the
hour
if
there
chanced
to
be
sympathetic
listener
and
talk
better
than
the
best
page
of
his
writings
for
a
pen
half
paralyzed
his
genius
a
child
would
sit
quietly
at
his
feet
and
wonder
till
the
torrent
had
passed
by
the
only
man
like
coleridge
whom
i
have
known
is
sir
william
hamilton
astronomer
royal
of
i
remember
however
that
when
i
recited
by
his
fireside
alfred
two
political
poems
ask
me
why
though
ill
at
ease
and
old
sat
freedom
on
the
heights
the
old
bard
listened
with
a
deepening
attention
and
when
i
had
ended
said
after
a
pause
must
acknowledge
that
those
two
poems
are
very
solid
and
noble
in
thought
their
diction
also
seems
singularly
he
was
a
great
admirer
of
philip
van
artevelde
in
the
case
of
a
certain
poet
since
dead
and
little
popular
he
said
to
me
consider
his
sonnets
to
be
certainly
the
best
of
modern
adding
course
i
am
not
including
my
own
in
any
comparison
with
those
of
he
was
not
sanguine
as
to
the
future
of
english
poetry
he
thought
that
there
was
much
to
be
supplied
in
other
departments
of
our
literature
and
especially
he
desired
a
really
great
history
of
england
but
he
was
disposed
to
regard
the
roll
of
english
poetry
as
made
up
and
as
leaving
place
for
little
more
except
what
was
likely
to
be
eccentric
or
imitational
in
his
younger
days
wordsworth
had
had
to
fight
a
great
battle
in
poetry
for
both
his
subjects
and
his
mode
of
treating
them
were
antagonistic
to
the
maxims
then
current
it
was
fortunate
for
posterity
no
doubt
that
his
long
was
animated
by
some
mingling
of
personal
ambition
with
his
love
of
poetry
speaking
in
an
early
sonnet
of
poets
who
on
earth
have
made
us
heirs
of
truth
and
pure
delight
by
heavenly
lays
he
concludes
might
my
name
be
numbered
among
theirs
then
gladly
would
i
end
my
mortal
he
died
at
eighty
and
general
fame
did
not
come
to
him
till
about
fifteen
years
before
his
death
this
might
perhaps
have
been
fifteen
years
too
soon
if
he
had
set
any
inordinate
value
on
it
but
it
was
not
so
shelley
tells
us
that
is
love
and
it
was
intellectual
sympathy
that
wordsworth
had
always
valued
far
more
than
reputation
me
thy
love
i
claim
no
other
fee
had
been
his
demand
on
his
reader
when
fame
had
laid
her
tardy
garland
at
his
feet
he
found
on
it
no
fresher
green
than
his
had
always
worn
once
he
said
to
me
is
indeed
a
deep
satisfaction
to
hope
and
believe
that
my
poetry
will
be
while
it
lasts
a
help
to
the
cause
of
virtue
and
truth
especially
among
the
young
as
for
myself
it
seems
now
of
little
moment
how
long
i
may
be
remembered
when
a
man
pushes
off
in
his
little
boat
into
the
great
seas
of
infinity
and
eternity
it
surely
signifies
little
how
long
he
is
kept
in
sight
by
watchers
from
the
such
are
my
chief
recollections
of
the
great
poet
whom
i
knew
but
in
his
old
age
but
whose
heart
retained
its
youth
till
his
daughter
death
he
seemed
to
me
one
who
from
boyhood
had
been
faithful
to
a
high
vocation
one
who
had
esteemed
it
his
office
to
minister
in
an
age
of
conventional
civilization
at
altar
and
who
had
in
his
later
life
explained
and
vindicated
such
lifelong
ministration
even
while
he
seemed
to
apologize
for
it
in
the
memorable
confession
who
is
innocent
by
grace
divine
not
otherwise
o
nature
are
we
it
was
to
nature
as
first
created
not
to
nature
as
corrupted
by
passions
that
his
song
had
attributed
such
high
and
healing
powers
in
singing
her
praise
he
had
chosen
a
theme
loftier
than
most
of
his
readers
knew
loftier
as
he
perhaps
eventually
discovered
than
he
had
at
first
supposed
it
to
be
utterly
without
dramatic
faculty
he
was
richer
and
wider
in
the
humanities
than
any
poet
since
shakspere
wholly
unlike
milton
in
character
and
in
opinions
he
abounds
in
passages
to
be
paralleled
only
by
milton
in
solemn
and
spiritual
sublimity
and
not
even
by
milton
in
pathos
it
was
plain
to
those
who
knew
wordsworth
that
he
had
kept
his
great
gift
pure
and
used
it
honestly
and
thoroughly
for
that
purpose
for
which
it
had
been
bestowed
he
had
ever
written
with
a
conscientious
reverence
for
that
gift
but
he
had
also
written
spontaneously
he
had
composed
with
care
not
the
exaggerated
solicitude
which
is
prompted
by
vanity
and
which
frets
itself
to
unite
incompatible
excellences
but
the
diligence
which
shrinks
from
no
toil
while
eradicating
blemishes
that
confuse
a
meaning
and
frustrate
its
purpose
he
regarded
poetry
as
an
art
but
he
also
regarded
art
not
as
the
compeer
of
nature
much
less
her
superior
but
as
her
servant
and
interpreter
he
wrote
poetry
likewise
no
doubt
in
a
large
measure
because
was
an
essential
law
of
his
nature
if
he
had
a
companion
he
discoursed
like
one
whose
thoughts
must
needs
run
on
in
audible
current
if
he
walked
alone
among
his
mountains
he
murmured
old
songs
he
was
like
a
vocal
as
well
as
visible
but
to
poetry
he
had
dedicated
himself
as
to
the
utterance
of
the
highest
truths
brought
within
the
range
of
his
experience
and
if
his
poetry
has
been
accused
of
egotism
the
charge
has
come
from
those
who
did
not
perceive
that
it
was
with
a
human
not
a
mere
personal
interest
that
he
habitually
watched
the
processes
of
his
own
mind
he
drew
from
the
fountain
that
was
nearest
at
hand
what
he
hoped
might
be
a
refreshment
to
those
far
off
he
once
said
speaking
of
a
departed
man
of
genius
who
had
lived
an
unhappy
life
and
deplorably
abused
his
powers
to
the
lasting
calamity
of
his
country
great
poet
must
be
a
great
man
and
a
great
man
must
be
a
good
man
and
a
good
man
ought
to
be
a
happy
to
know
wordsworth
was
to
feel
sure
that
if
he
had
been
a
great
poet
it
was
not
merely
because
he
had
been
endowed
with
a
great
imagination
but
because
he
had
been
a
good
man
a
great
man
and
a
man
whose
poetry
had
in
an
especial
sense
been
the
expression
of
a
healthily
happy
moral
being
wordsworth
was
by
no
means
without
humor
when
the
queen
on
one
occasion
gave
a
masked
ball
some
one
said
that
a
certain
youthful
poet
who
has
since
reached
a
deservedly
high
place
both
in
the
literary
and
political
world
but
who
was
then
known
chiefly
as
an
accomplished
and
amusing
young
man
of
society
was
to
attend
it
dressed
in
the
character
of
the
father
of
english
poetry
grave
old
chaucer
said
wordsworth
go
as
chaucer
then
it
only
remains
for
me
to
go
as
m
part
ii
sonnet
rydal
with
wordsworth
by
the
late
sir
aubrey
de
vere
we
beheld
scarce
can
i
now
recall
in
one
connected
picture
images
hurrying
so
swiftly
their
fresh
witcheries
the
mirror
that
the
several
seems
lost
or
blended
in
the
mighty
all
lone
lakes
rills
gushing
through
trees
peaked
mountains
shadowing
vales
of
peacefulness
glens
echoing
to
the
flashing
waterfall
then
that
sweet
twilight
isle
with
friends
delayed
beside
a
ferny
bank
oaks
and
yews
the
moon
between
two
mountain
peaks
embayed
heaven
and
the
waters
dyed
with
sunset
hues
and
he
the
poet
of
the
age
and
land
discoursing
as
we
wandered
hand
in
the
sonnet
is
the
record
of
a
delightful
day
spent
by
my
father
in
with
wordsworth
at
rydal
to
which
he
went
from
the
still
more
beautiful
shores
of
ulswater
where
he
had
been
sojourning
at
halsteads
he
had
been
one
of
warmest
admirers
when
their
number
was
small
and
in
he
dedicated
a
volume
of
poems
to
him
he
taught
me
when
a
boy
of
eighteen
years
old
to
admire
the
great
bard
i
had
been
very
enthusiastically
praising
lord
poetry
my
father
calmly
replied
is
the
great
poet
of
modern
much
surprised
i
asked
what
may
his
special
merits
be
the
answer
was
are
very
various
as
for
instance
depth
largeness
elevation
and
what
is
rare
in
modern
poetry
an
purity
in
his
noble
they
are
chiefly
majesty
and
a
few
weeks
afterwards
i
chanced
to
take
from
the
library
shelves
a
volume
of
wordsworth
and
it
opened
on
some
strong
calm
hand
seemed
to
have
been
laid
on
my
head
and
bound
me
to
the
spot
till
i
had
come
to
the
end
as
i
read
a
new
world
hitherto
unimagined
opened
itself
out
stretching
far
away
into
serene
infinitudes
the
region
was
one
to
me
unknown
but
the
harmony
of
the
picture
attested
its
reality
above
and
around
were
indeed
ampler
ether
a
diviner
air
and
fields
invested
with
purpureal
and
when
i
reached
the
line
pleasures
there
abide
majestic
pains
i
felt
that
no
tenants
less
stately
could
walk
in
so
lordly
a
precinct
i
had
been
translated
into
another
planet
of
song
one
with
larger
movements
and
a
longer
year
a
wider
conception
of
poetry
had
become
mine
and
the
byronian
enthusiasm
fell
from
me
like
a
bond
that
is
broken
by
being
outgrown
the
incident
illustrates
poetry
in
one
of
its
many
characters
that
of
the
the
ready
sympathies
and
inexperienced
imagination
of
youth
make
it
surrender
itself
easily
despite
its
better
aspirations
or
in
consequence
of
them
to
a
false
greatness
and
the
true
greatness
once
revealed
sets
it
free
as
early
as
walter
savage
landor
in
his
between
southey
and
porson
had
pronounced
to
be
composition
such
as
sophocles
might
have
exulted
to
own
and
a
part
of
which
might
have
been
heard
with
shouts
of
rapture
in
the
regions
he
the
elysian
fields
wordsworth
frequently
spoke
of
death
as
if
it
were
the
taking
of
a
new
degree
in
the
university
of
life
should
like
he
remarked
to
a
young
lady
visit
italy
again
before
i
move
to
another
he
sometimes
made
a
mistake
in
assuming
that
others
were
equally
philosophical
we
were
once
breakfasting
at
the
house
of
rogers
when
wordsworth
after
gazing
attentively
round
the
room
with
a
benignant
and
complacent
expression
turned
to
our
host
and
wishing
to
compliment
him
said
rogers
i
never
see
this
house
so
perfect
in
its
taste
so
exquisite
in
all
its
arrangements
and
decorated
with
such
pictures
without
fancying
it
the
very
house
imaged
to
himself
by
the
roman
poet
when
in
illustration
of
mortality
he
says
est
is
that
saying
replied
rogers
whose
years
between
eighty
and
ninety
had
not
improved
his
hearing
was
remarking
that
your
house
replied
wordsworth
reminds
me
of
the
ode
more
properly
called
an
elegy
though
doubtless
the
lyrical
measure
not
unnaturally
causes
it
to
be
included
among
odes
in
which
the
roman
poet
writes
est
that
is
since
ladies
being
present
a
translation
may
be
deemed
desirable
house
or
to
be
and
again
placens
and
the
pleasing
wife
though
as
we
must
all
regret
that
part
of
the
quotation
is
not
applicable
on
the
present
the
town
bard
on
whom
angle
more
than
the
end
of
place
did
not
enter
into
the
views
of
the
bard
of
the
mountains
his
answer
was
what
children
call
a
great
face
and
the
ejaculation
talk
latin
in
the
society
of
when
i
was
going
away
he
remarked
a
stimulus
the
mountain
air
has
on
the
appetite
i
made
a
sign
to
edmund
to
hand
him
the
cutlets
a
second
time
i
was
afraid
he
would
stick
his
fork
into
that
beautiful
woman
who
sat
next
wordsworth
never
resented
a
jest
at
his
own
expense
once
when
we
had
knocked
three
times
in
vain
at
the
door
of
a
london
house
i
exclaimed
quoting
his
sonnet
written
on
westminster
bridge
god
the
very
houses
seem
he
laughed
heartily
then
smiled
gravely
and
lastly
recounted
the
occasion
and
described
the
early
morning
on
which
that
sonnet
was
written
he
did
not
recite
more
than
a
part
of
it
to
the
accompaniment
of
distant
cab
and
carriage
and
i
thought
that
the
door
was
opened
too
soon
wordsworth
despite
his
dislike
to
great
cities
was
attracted
occasionally
in
his
later
years
the
proud
margin
of
the
thames
and
venerable
towers
where
his
society
was
courted
by
persons
of
the
most
different
character
but
he
complained
bitterly
of
the
great
city
it
was
next
to
impossible
he
remarked
to
tell
the
truth
in
it
i
was
at
s
house
the
duchess
of
s
showing
me
the
pictures
observed
is
the
portrait
of
my
naming
him
it
is
considered
very
to
this
i
assented
partly
perhaps
in
absence
of
mind
but
partly
i
think
with
an
impression
that
her
brother
was
probably
a
person
whose
face
every
one
knew
or
was
expected
to
know
so
that
as
i
had
never
met
him
my
answer
was
in
fact
a
lie
it
is
too
bad
that
when
more
than
seventy
years
old
i
should
be
drawn
from
the
mountains
to
london
in
order
to
tell
a
lie
he
made
his
complaint
wherever
he
went
laying
the
blame
however
not
so
much
on
himself
or
on
the
duchess
as
on
the
corrupt
city
and
some
of
those
who
learned
how
the
most
truthful
man
in
england
had
thus
quickly
been
subverted
by
metropolitan
snares
came
to
the
conclusion
that
within
a
few
years
more
no
virtue
would
be
left
extant
in
the
land
he
was
likewise
maltreated
in
lesser
ways
morning
i
was
compelled
by
my
engagements
to
eat
three
breakfasts
one
with
an
aged
and
excellent
gentleman
who
may
justly
be
esteemed
an
accomplished
man
of
letters
although
i
can
not
honestly
concede
to
him
the
title
of
a
poet
one
at
a
fashionable
party
and
one
with
an
old
friend
whom
no
pressure
would
induce
me
to
neglect
although
for
this
my
first
breakfast
i
was
obliged
to
name
the
early
hour
of
seven
as
he
lives
in
a
remote
part
of
but
it
was
only
among
his
own
mountains
that
wordsworth
could
be
understood
he
walked
among
them
not
so
much
to
admire
them
as
to
converse
with
them
they
exchanged
thoughts
with
him
in
sunshine
or
flying
shadow
giving
him
their
own
and
accepting
his
day
and
night
at
all
hours
and
in
all
weathers
he
would
face
them
if
it
rained
he
might
fling
his
plaid
over
him
but
would
take
no
admonition
he
must
have
his
way
on
such
occasions
dutiful
as
he
was
in
higher
matters
he
remained
incurably
wayward
in
vain
one
reminded
him
that
a
letter
needed
an
answer
or
that
the
storm
would
soon
be
over
it
was
very
necessary
for
him
to
do
what
he
liked
and
one
of
his
dearest
friends
said
to
me
with
a
smile
of
the
most
affectionate
humor
wrote
his
to
duty
and
then
he
had
done
with
that
this
very
innocent
form
of
lawlessness
corresponding
with
the
classic
expression
genio
seemed
to
belong
to
his
genius
not
less
than
the
sympathetic
reverence
with
which
he
looked
up
to
the
higher
and
universal
laws
sometimes
there
was
a
battle
between
his
reverence
for
nature
and
his
reverence
for
other
things
the
friend
already
alluded
to
was
once
remarking
on
his
varying
expressions
of
countenance
rough
old
face
is
capable
of
high
and
real
beauty
i
have
seen
in
it
an
expression
quite
of
heavenly
peace
and
contemplative
delight
as
the
may
breeze
came
over
him
from
the
woods
while
he
was
slowly
walking
out
of
church
on
a
sunday
morning
and
when
he
had
half
emerged
from
the
a
flippant
person
present
inquired
you
ever
chance
miss
f
to
observe
that
heavenly
expression
on
his
countenance
as
he
was
walking
into
church
on
a
fine
may
morning
a
laugh
was
the
reply
the
ways
of
nature
harmonized
with
his
feelings
in
age
as
well
as
in
youth
he
could
understand
no
estrangement
gathering
a
wreath
of
white
thorn
on
one
occasion
he
murmured
as
he
slipped
it
into
the
ribbon
which
bound
the
golden
tresses
of
his
youthful
companion
what
if
i
enwreathed
my
own
no
offence
to
reason
the
sober
hills
thus
deck
their
brows
to
meet
the
wintry
sir
thomas
more
historical
from
the
french
of
the
princesse
de
craon
iii
well
and
so
you
are
going
to
carry
the
french
birds
back
exclaimed
the
old
keeper
jack
with
a
loud
coarse
laugh
as
he
leaned
against
one
of
the
trees
in
windsor
forest
well
so
be
it
my
friends
but
give
us
a
little
drop
to
drink
he
added
in
a
jocular
but
tone
as
he
said
these
words
he
familiarly
slapped
the
shoulder
of
one
of
the
falconers
who
was
engaged
in
fastening
the
chains
again
to
the
feet
of
the
tiercelets
whilst
his
comrades
cut
off
the
heads
of
the
game
taken
and
threw
them
as
a
reward
to
the
cruel
birds
who
devoured
them
with
avidity
a
while
replied
the
falconer
a
little
impatiently
till
our
work
is
done
father
jack
you
are
always
in
a
hurry
to
drink
we
will
take
our
glass
together
now
directly
see
that
troop
of
birds
they
must
first
be
chained
and
put
with
the
well
replied
jack
we
lose
nothing
by
waiting
these
are
beautiful
birds
if
they
do
come
from
no
you
shall
lose
nothing
by
waiting
cried
the
second
falconer
here
i
will
let
you
taste
a
liquid
that
these
birds
have
brought
over
under
their
wings
and
we
will
see
then
if
you
have
ever
drunk
anything
equal
to
it
since
you
drew
on
your
boots
in
the
service
of
his
and
he
poured
out
of
a
canteen
that
hung
from
his
a
very
acid
gin
filling
until
it
foamed
over
a
large
pewter
cup
which
he
handed
to
father
jack
it
was
swallowed
at
one
draught
superb
superb
cried
the
old
keeper
returning
the
cup
and
smacking
his
lips
the
years
past
that
i
have
had
the
honor
of
keeping
windsor
i
have
drunk
nothing
better
go
that
strengthens
a
courage
and
warms
up
his
old
blood
i
believe
the
deer
will
give
us
a
hard
drive
i
have
seen
the
tracks
of
fourteen
or
fifteen
at
and
saying
this
he
remounted
his
old
mare
father
jack
wait
for
us
we
will
all
go
together
exclaimed
the
de
for
jack
contributed
much
to
their
amusement
when
they
had
mounted
their
horses
they
followed
the
keeper
getting
off
a
hundred
jokes
on
the
old
mare
to
which
he
was
much
attached
they
very
soon
passed
by
two
young
lords
who
had
halted
near
the
verge
of
the
forest
and
were
engaged
in
conversation
one
of
them
held
in
leash
four
beautiful
greyhounds
especial
favorites
of
the
king
because
of
their
great
sagacity
and
swiftness
in
the
chase
their
keeper
however
was
obliged
to
use
the
lash
in
order
to
stop
their
clamorous
baying
have
seen
her
then
he
remarked
to
his
companion
i
have
seen
her
down
yonder
she
crossed
the
road
with
all
of
her
ladies
replied
the
latter
who
belonged
to
household
and
wore
his
livery
was
dressed
in
a
black
velvet
cap
and
green
and
she
is
really
charming
my
poor
friend
replied
the
other
do
you
know
i
have
serious
fears
that
your
cardinal
will
soon
fall
into
disfavor
but
a
moment
ago
as
they
passed
by
here
i
heard
the
duke
of
norfolk
remark
to
a
lady
that
the
red
cloak
was
decidedly
out
of
style
and
altogether
it
was
at
this
time
so
completely
used
up
that
he
did
not
think
it
could
ever
again
be
mended
the
lady
smiled
maliciously
and
said
he
was
right
she
believed
the
green
mantle
would
eventually
end
by
tearing
the
red
to
pieces
and
pointing
to
the
young
anne
boleyn
who
was
not
far
off
she
made
a
sign
that
left
no
doubt
on
my
mind
it
was
that
lady
she
meant
to
designate
as
the
replied
the
young
domestic
you
tell
me
is
anything
but
encouraging
and
so
our
dear
duke
must
have
finger
in
the
pie
i
shall
be
very
sorry
for
all
this
if
it
happens
because
my
own
clothes
are
made
of
scarlet
you
see
and
when
one
has
succeeded
in
the
course
of
time
in
getting
a
suit
well
made
up
he
like
the
trouble
of
having
to
commence
again
and
make
it
as
he
said
this
a
cloud
of
dust
arose
and
a
troop
of
horsemen
passed
at
full
gallop
and
with
a
terrible
hue
and
cry
dogs
my
dogs
cried
the
king
in
the
midst
of
the
crowd
loose
my
dogs
the
deer
makes
for
the
ponds
let
them
hasten
to
tell
the
ladies
that
they
may
be
in
at
the
he
disappeared
like
a
flash
of
lightning
of
which
we
obtain
but
a
glimpse
ere
it
is
gone
the
shrill
notes
of
the
horn
resounded
from
afar
awaking
countless
echoes
through
the
forest
us
go
exclaimed
the
two
young
men
simultaneously
will
then
get
rid
of
these
accursed
the
ponds
to
the
ponds
they
cried
ladies
to
the
ponds
the
ladies
to
the
ponds
and
they
started
on
laughing
and
shouting
is
that
you
are
shouting
down
there
cried
a
huntsman
from
a
distance
whose
horse
had
just
made
him
roll
in
the
dust
the
ponds
my
lord
to
the
ponds
they
cried
the
retinue
surrounding
the
duke
of
suffolk
put
whip
to
their
horses
and
followed
in
a
sweeping
gallop
from
every
side
of
the
hills
surrounding
these
ponds
there
appeared
at
the
same
moment
troops
of
eager
hunters
panting
and
covered
with
dust
the
different
roads
traversing
the
forest
in
every
direction
converged
and
met
on
the
banks
of
the
ponds
that
slept
in
the
basin
thus
formed
the
ladies
had
already
assembled
and
nothing
could
have
been
more
entertaining
than
the
rapid
and
eager
movements
of
the
remainder
of
the
hunters
as
they
came
galloping
up
the
king
arrived
before
any
of
the
others
he
excelled
in
exercises
of
this
kind
and
took
great
delight
in
ending
the
chase
in
a
brilliant
manner
by
shooting
the
deer
himself
on
this
occasion
he
had
decided
that
contrary
to
the
usual
custom
it
should
be
taken
alive
consequently
they
hastened
to
spread
in
every
direction
the
nets
and
fillets
in
this
case
the
skill
of
the
hunters
consisted
in
driving
the
game
into
the
snare
very
soon
the
deer
made
his
appearance
followed
by
a
multitude
of
hounds
who
pursued
him
so
furiously
and
crowded
so
closely
one
against
the
other
that
to
use
a
familiar
expression
of
the
hunters
they
could
have
been
covered
with
a
at
sight
of
the
nets
the
beautiful
animal
paused
for
an
instant
he
shook
his
horns
menacingly
and
stamped
the
ground
with
his
feet
then
suddenly
feeling
already
the
scorching
breath
of
the
infuriated
pack
of
hounds
about
to
seize
him
he
made
a
desperate
effort
and
leaping
at
a
single
bound
the
entire
height
of
the
fillets
threw
himself
into
the
lake
instantly
a
loud
and
deafening
shout
arose
while
the
furious
hounds
arrested
in
their
course
by
the
nets
uttered
the
most
frightful
howlings
on
seeing
their
prey
escape
cried
the
king
my
and
he
drew
it
so
skilfully
that
at
the
first
shot
he
pierced
the
flank
of
the
poor
animal
who
immediately
ceased
to
swim
satisfied
with
his
brilliant
success
the
king
after
having
heard
the
plaudits
of
the
ladies
and
received
the
congratulations
of
the
hunters
proceeded
to
the
pavilion
constructed
of
evergreens
and
foliage
as
elegant
as
it
was
spacious
which
he
had
had
erected
in
the
midst
of
the
forest
in
order
to
dine
under
cover
the
duchess
of
suffolk
did
the
honors
of
the
festival
taking
the
place
of
queen
catherine
who
under
the
pretext
of
bad
health
declined
appearing
at
these
hunting
parties
the
noisy
sports
having
become
insupportable
to
her
meanwhile
the
courtiers
were
greatly
excited
by
observing
a
roll
of
paper
the
extremity
of
which
projected
from
the
right
pocket
of
the
on
one
of
the
leaves
a
corner
of
which
was
turned
down
two
words
were
visible
the
name
of
and
that
of
each
one
sought
to
approach
the
king
or
pass
behind
him
in
order
to
assure
himself
of
the
astonishing
fact
of
which
they
had
the
temerity
to
whisper
mysteriously
together
but
in
spite
of
all
their
efforts
they
were
unable
to
discover
anything
more
the
day
and
the
festival
ended
with
numerous
conjectures
the
fears
and
hopes
excited
in
the
minds
of
that
court
where
for
so
long
the
learned
favorite
had
ruled
with
as
much
authority
as
the
king
himself
at
daybreak
on
the
morning
succeeding
the
festival
the
gates
were
thrown
open
and
a
carriage
bearing
the
royal
arms
and
colors
drove
from
the
great
courtyard
of
windsor
palace
while
the
postilion
trotted
leisurely
along
looking
around
from
time
to
time
as
he
wonderingly
reflected
why
the
horse
on
his
right
grew
constantly
lean
in
spite
of
the
generous
addition
he
had
made
to
his
rations
the
two
occupants
of
the
carriage
engaged
in
the
following
conversation
is
cold
this
morning
said
one
of
them
wrapping
his
cloak
more
closely
about
him
and
how
this
fog
and
the
heavy
dew
covering
the
earth
remind
one
of
the
bivouac
does
indeed
responded
norfolk
to
his
companion
such
souvenirs
are
always
agreeable
and
carry
us
back
to
the
happiest
days
of
life
years
spent
amid
the
tumult
and
vicissitudes
of
the
camp
eighteen
that
impulsive
impetuous
age
when
presumptuous
courage
rushes
headlong
into
danger
comprehending
nothing
of
death
when
reckless
intrepidity
permits
not
a
reflection
or
hesitation
transported
by
the
ardent
desire
of
acquiring
glory
the
intoxicating
happiness
of
a
first
success
such
are
the
thrilling
emotions
the
brilliant
illusions
of
youth
which
we
shall
experience
no
more
and
the
old
warrior
sorrowfully
bowed
his
head
well
others
replace
them
replied
suffolk
to
be
displaced
and
disappear
in
their
turn
answered
the
duke
brushing
back
the
white
locks
the
wind
had
blown
over
his
forehead
on
which
appeared
a
deep
scar
my
lord
exclaimed
the
duke
of
suffolk
not
spoil
by
your
philosophic
reflections
all
the
pleasure
we
ought
to
enjoy
in
the
thought
that
thanks
to
the
influence
and
good
management
of
your
charming
niece
we
are
now
going
to
inform
monseigneur
wolsey
that
the
time
has
at
last
arrived
for
him
to
abdicate
his
portion
of
the
perhaps
so
replied
the
duke
yet
i
know
yesterday
even
i
detested
this
man
and
desired
most
ardently
his
ruin
no
no
an
enemy
vanquished
and
prostrate
at
my
feet
inspires
only
compassion
now
i
almost
regret
the
injury
my
niece
has
done
him
and
the
blow
she
has
come
my
lord
do
you
not
know
that
an
excess
of
generosity
becomes
a
fault
we
have
nothing
to
regret
continued
suffolk
with
an
exulting
laugh
only
hope
he
may
not
be
acquitted
and
thus
be
able
to
settle
the
scores
with
us
afterwards
that
parliament
will
show
him
no
mercy
death
alone
can
effectually
remove
him
the
little
memorandum
you
have
there
contains
enough
to
hang
all
the
chancellors
in
the
is
very
certain
replied
the
duke
of
norfolk
abstractedly
turning
the
leaves
of
the
book
he
held
in
his
hand
the
same
that
had
excited
such
eager
curiosity
among
the
courtiers
is
certain
this
book
contains
grave
accusations
nevertheless
i
do
not
think
it
has
entirely
accomplished
the
end
proposed
by
the
truth
no
answered
suffolk
wiltshire
counted
very
certainly
on
replacing
wolsey
he
will
be
astounded
when
he
learns
of
the
choice
of
the
wiltshire
is
a
relative
of
mine
replied
the
duke
am
compelled
to
acknowledge
that
it
would
have
been
impossible
for
the
king
to
have
made
a
better
selection
or
avoided
a
worse
one
wiltshire
is
both
ignorant
and
ambitious
while
thomas
more
has
no
superior
in
learning
and
merit
i
knew
him
when
quite
a
child
living
with
the
distinguished
cardinal
morton
who
was
particularly
attached
to
him
i
remember
very
often
at
table
morton
speaking
of
him
to
us
and
always
saying
young
boy
will
make
an
extraordinary
man
you
will
see
it
i
shall
not
be
living
but
you
will
then
recall
the
prediction
of
an
old
replied
suffolk
in
his
habitual
tone
of
raillery
extraordinary
we
are
promised
then
a
chancellor
of
a
peculiar
species
i
suppose
he
will
not
be
the
least
astonished
at
receiving
so
high
and
singular
a
favor
but
the
devil
he
will
need
to
be
a
wonderful
man
if
he
sustains
himself
on
the
throne
ministerial
he
will
find
a
superior
degree
of
wisdom
necessary
between
the
king
the
queen
the
council
wiltshire
the
parliament
the
clergy
and
the
people
i
would
not
risk
my
little
finger
of
his
majesty
although
i
have
the
honor
to
and
he
began
laughing
as
he
looked
at
norfolk
although
out
of
deference
to
him
he
had
not
included
in
the
list
of
difficulties
the
most
formidable
of
all
and
the
one
that
carried
all
others
in
its
train
his
niece
mlle
anne
the
sense
you
use
the
word
the
duke
answered
coldly
believe
on
the
contrary
he
is
by
no
means
an
astute
man
the
intrigues
of
court
will
be
altogether
foreign
to
his
character
but
otherwise
in
science
and
learning
he
has
no
equal
he
is
in
possession
of
all
that
a
man
is
capable
of
acquiring
in
that
direction
and
no
man
has
made
a
more
profound
study
of
the
common
law
and
the
statutes
of
the
kingdom
morton
placed
him
at
oxford
then
at
the
college
at
lincoln
and
he
achieved
the
most
brilliant
exclaimed
suffolk
laughing
that
time
pursued
the
duke
of
norfolk
reputation
has
continued
to
increase
when
he
lectured
in
church
the
celebrated
grocyn
and
all
of
our
london
crowded
eagerly
to
hear
well
i
knew
nothing
of
these
most
agreeable
particulars
said
suffolk
only
knew
that
it
was
he
who
induced
parliament
to
refuse
the
subsidy
demanded
for
the
queen
of
scots
if
he
continues
to
repeat
such
exploits
as
that
i
venture
to
predict
he
will
not
be
chancellor
very
as
to
that
replied
the
duke
is
a
man
who
will
never
compromise
his
conscience
yes
yes
i
recall
distinctly
the
enraged
expression
of
the
present
father
when
tyler
came
to
inform
him
that
the
house
of
commons
had
rejected
his
demand
and
a
beardless
youth
had
been
the
cause
of
it
i
have
not
forgotten
either
that
henry
of
happy
memory
well
knew
how
to
avenge
himself
by
having
an
enormous
fine
imposed
on
sir
replied
suffolk
it
was
not
always
expedient
for
the
house
of
commons
to
raise
money
in
that
the
conversation
was
continued
in
this
manner
as
the
hours
glided
by
until
at
length
the
glittering
spires
of
the
london
churches
appeared
in
the
distance
and
very
soon
the
carriage
had
entered
the
narrow
gloomy
streets
of
that
great
city
just
at
this
time
the
soul
of
wolsey
was
replenished
with
an
inexpressible
quietude
and
contentment
last
he
said
to
himself
enemies
have
all
been
confounded
i
can
no
longer
entertain
a
doubt
respecting
my
power
after
the
most
gracious
manner
in
which
the
king
has
treated
me
at
grafton
i
trust
the
influence
of
anne
boleyn
has
diminished
in
the
same
proportion
that
mine
has
increased
now
she
wants
sir
thomas
cheney
recalled
but
i
shall
not
consent
to
that
campeggio
goes
loaded
with
honorable
presents
the
influence
of
the
mistress
will
soon
cease
and
that
ambitious
fool
wiltshire
will
lose
the
fruit
of
his
as
the
cardinal
of
york
consoled
himself
with
these
agreeable
reflections
the
arrival
of
the
venetian
ambassador
was
announced
so
he
presents
himself
at
last
wolsey
exclaimed
has
been
a
long
time
demanding
an
audience
and
he
ordered
him
to
be
introduced
wolsey
received
him
in
the
most
gracious
manner
after
the
usual
compliments
were
exchanged
he
proposed
showing
him
the
honors
of
the
palace
he
had
spent
his
life
in
embellishing
and
adorning
it
with
wonderful
treasures
of
industry
and
art
of
which
he
was
the
enlightened
and
generous
protector
bestowing
on
them
from
his
own
purse
the
most
liberal
encouragement
numerous
galleries
in
which
an
exquisite
taste
had
evidently
directed
even
the
most
trivial
ornamentation
were
filled
with
paintings
statues
and
precious
antique
vases
superb
flanders
tapestries
gleamed
on
all
sides
covered
the
panels
were
disposed
around
the
windows
and
fell
in
heavy
drapery
before
the
openings
of
the
doors
to
conceal
the
entrance
these
precious
cloths
then
of
inestimable
value
were
only
found
in
the
palaces
of
kings
they
usually
represented
some
historical
or
poetical
subject
and
sometimes
landscapes
and
the
rarest
flowers
were
wrought
and
tinted
with
reflections
of
gold
finally
wolsey
took
occasion
to
point
out
among
all
these
treasures
the
presents
he
had
received
at
different
times
from
the
various
princes
of
europe
who
had
sought
to
secure
his
influence
charmed
with
the
order
taste
and
beauty
that
reigned
throughout
the
palace
the
italian
admired
everything
surprised
to
find
in
this
foreign
clime
a
condition
of
luxury
that
recalled
the
memory
always
pleasing
yet
sometimes
sad
of
his
own
country
he
exclaimed
at
length
also
were
rich
and
happy
and
reposed
in
peace
and
security
in
our
palaces
before
this
war
in
which
we
have
been
so
unfortunate
as
to
rely
on
the
king
of
france
for
assistance
he
has
abandoned
us
and
now
compelled
to
pay
an
enormous
tribute
the
republic
finds
itself
humiliated
in
the
dust
beneath
the
sceptre
of
the
haughty
emperor
is
the
right
of
the
conqueror
replied
wolsey
are
fortunate
inasmuch
as
he
is
forced
to
use
that
right
with
seems
a
heavy
burden
to
us
this
moderation
replied
the
ambassador
not
only
exacts
immense
sums
of
money
but
compels
us
to
surrender
territory
we
have
conquered
with
our
blood
florence
is
placed
under
the
dominion
of
the
medici
and
all
of
our
italian
princes
are
reduced
to
a
condition
of
entire
of
course
they
will
shake
off
at
the
first
opportunity
interrupted
wolsey
is
too
shrewd
not
to
foresee
that
be
assured
he
will
endeavor
to
secure
your
because
your
support
is
indispensable
to
enable
him
to
resist
the
formidable
power
of
the
sultan
soliman
and
the
invasions
of
the
barbarians
subject
to
his
that
we
have
placed
our
last
hope
if
our
services
can
be
made
available
then
from
vanquished
enemies
we
may
become
united
allies
already
the
emperor
foresees
it
for
he
overwhelms
andrew
doria
and
the
republic
of
genoa
with
favors
he
seems
to
have
forgotten
the
injuries
he
suffered
from
sforza
he
received
him
most
affably
at
court
and
promised
him
the
princess
of
denmark
his
niece
in
am
informed
said
wolsey
he
is
deeply
afflicted
by
the
death
of
the
prince
of
much
replied
the
ambassador
prince
was
a
valiant
captain
he
leaves
no
children
his
titles
and
landed
property
will
descend
to
the
children
of
his
sister
rénée
the
countess
of
they
are
all
german
princes
who
have
thrown
themselves
headlong
into
the
lutheran
heresy
they
will
endeavor
to
cast
off
the
yoke
of
the
emperor
and
become
altogether
have
no
other
intention
replied
the
ambassador
by
separating
from
the
church
of
rome
they
hope
more
surely
to
effect
their
purpose
however
the
decree
laid
before
the
diet
against
the
religious
innovations
has
passed
by
a
large
replied
wolsey
you
see
the
elector
of
saxony
the
marquis
of
brandenburg
the
landgrave
of
hesse
the
dukes
of
luneburg
and
the
prince
are
all
leagued
against
the
church
with
the
deputies
of
fourteen
imperial
cities
and
are
designated
by
no
other
name
than
that
of
am
aware
of
that
replied
the
ambassador
will
greatly
increase
the
difficulties
in
carrying
out
the
secret
project
he
continued
after
a
silence
however
he
may
succeed
in
making
the
crown
hereditary
in
his
is
what
we
shall
have
to
prevent
cried
wolsey
vehemently
who
at
the
words
of
the
ambassador
felt
all
his
old
hatred
toward
charles
revive
will
never
suffer
it
neither
will
france
no
no
i
am
very
certain
france
will
never
permit
replied
the
ambassador
shaking
his
head
with
a
doubtful
air
either
because
he
was
not
convinced
but
more
probably
because
he
was
well
pleased
to
arouse
against
the
conqueror
of
venice
the
animosity
of
england
still
as
he
considered
entirely
governed
by
the
will
of
the
minister
who
stood
before
him
assure
you
of
it
most
positively
answered
wolsey
i
wish
you
to
bear
it
in
and
he
regarded
him
with
an
expression
of
perfect
confidence
and
authority
hope
it
may
be
so
said
the
ambassador
in
an
abstracted
manner
certainly
desire
nothing
if
he
had
only
you
to
oppose
him
answered
wolsey
resuming
his
usual
haughtiness
should
doubt
of
success
see
where
you
stand
he
continued
with
the
secret
satisfaction
of
national
pride
on
all
sides
italy
can
oppose
but
a
feeble
barrier
to
the
power
of
two
such
bold
and
daring
pirates
is
it
not
a
shame
then
to
see
these
obscure
and
cruel
robbers
sons
of
a
lesbian
potter
two
barbarians
in
fact
reigning
sovereigns
of
the
kingdom
of
algiers
which
they
have
seized
and
from
whence
they
fearlessly
go
forth
to
destroy
the
christian
fleets
on
every
sea
when
would
you
be
able
to
conquer
these
ocean
pirates
you
who
have
but
a
gibbet
for
your
couch
and
a
halter
for
your
vestment
justice
would
be
kept
a
long
time
waiting
the
italian
reddened
and
bit
his
lip
he
vainly
sought
words
in
which
to
reply
and
was
relieved
of
his
embarrassment
when
the
door
opened
and
admitted
the
dukes
of
norfolk
and
suffolk
they
entered
without
the
usual
ceremonies
or
salutations
and
wolsey
surprised
at
seeing
suffolk
whom
he
had
not
met
since
the
altercation
at
blackfriars
regarded
them
with
astonishment
he
arose
however
and
advanced
toward
them
suffolk
with
a
disdainful
gesture
referred
him
to
the
duke
of
norfolk
astonished
at
the
coldness
of
the
one
the
brusque
impoliteness
of
the
other
and
embarrassed
by
the
presence
of
the
ambassador
the
cardinal
stood
motionless
undecided
what
to
think
or
say
lords
he
at
length
exclaimed
do
you
desire
of
me
want
you
to
deliver
up
the
seal
of
state
replied
norfolk
without
changing
countenance
do
you
say
my
lord
cried
wolsey
stupefied
with
astonishment
king
has
ordered
it
continued
the
duke
with
the
same
imperturbable
manner
king
can
it
be
possible
said
wolsey
dismayed
and
in
a
voice
almost
inaudible
seal
of
state
and
what
have
i
done
what
can
this
be
true
no
my
lord
no
he
suddenly
exclaimed
with
an
expression
of
indescribable
terror
can
not
be
true
you
have
mistaken
the
king
i
do
not
deserve
any
such
treatment
i
pray
you
let
me
see
him
let
me
speak
to
him
for
a
moment
one
single
moment
alas
alas
and
he
glanced
at
the
ambassador
who
astounded
himself
at
first
and
feeling
himself
out
of
place
in
the
presence
of
this
mighty
downfall
had
involuntarily
withdrawn
towards
the
door
is
no
longer
a
question
to
be
submitted
to
the
king
cried
suffolk
in
a
threatening
and
defiant
manner
is
only
necessary
now
to
obey
him
and
he
orders
you
instantly
to
deliver
up
the
order
is
imperative
added
norfolk
in
a
cold
and
serious
manner
regret
being
charged
with
a
commission
which
to
you
my
lord
must
be
so
he
said
no
more
but
suffolk
base
and
jealous
in
his
nature
was
not
ashamed
to
add
to
the
humiliation
of
the
unfortunate
cardinal
my
good
friend
he
said
in
an
ironical
voice
do
you
beg
so
imploringly
one
would
suppose
we
had
demanded
the
apple
of
your
eye
you
have
been
putting
the
seal
so
long
now
on
our
purses
and
tongues
you
ought
not
to
be
surprised
nor
annoyed
that
we
feel
like
using
it
awhile
this
cowardly
insult
exasperated
wolsey
but
his
courage
was
roused
with
his
indignation
lord
suffolk
he
answered
with
dignity
am
sorry
for
you
and
for
the
prompt
manner
in
which
you
seem
to
forget
in
their
misfortune
those
who
in
days
of
prosperity
were
always
found
ready
to
come
to
your
assistance
i
hope
you
may
never
experience
how
painful
it
is
to
endure
a
similar
cruel
he
immediately
withdrew
and
returned
with
the
casket
containing
the
great
seal
of
state
holding
it
in
his
trembling
hand
he
avoided
suffolk
and
advancing
rapidly
toward
the
duke
of
norfolk
handed
it
to
him
lord
he
said
are
the
seals
of
the
kingdom
of
england
let
the
will
be
done
since
i
received
them
from
his
hand
fifteen
years
ago
i
am
conscious
of
having
done
nothing
to
merit
his
displeasure
i
trust
he
will
one
day
deign
to
render
me
full
justice
for
i
have
never
proved
myself
unworthy
of
his
as
he
uttered
the
last
words
he
was
unable
to
restrain
the
tears
which
involuntarily
arose
to
his
eyes
although
the
cardinal
was
by
no
means
a
favorite
with
the
duke
of
norfolk
he
was
moved
with
compassion
and
sadly
reflected
that
he
had
still
more
painful
intelligence
to
communicate
he
glanced
at
his
companion
but
fearing
the
bitter
and
poignant
irony
in
which
suffolk
never
failed
to
indulge
he
hastened
to
prevent
it
in
order
to
spare
wolsey
lord
cardinal
he
said
ought
to
reflect
that
the
king
is
too
just
and
impartial
to
withdraw
the
favor
he
has
so
long
bestowed
on
you
without
having
weighed
well
the
reasons
and
necessities
requiring
such
a
course
nevertheless
his
goodness
has
not
abandoned
you
he
permits
you
to
select
such
counsel
as
you
may
desire
to
defend
you
against
the
accusations
presented
against
you
to
parliament
murmured
wolsey
for
the
last
words
suddenly
disclosed
the
depth
of
the
abyss
into
which
he
had
fallen
parliament
he
repeated
the
shock
he
had
experienced
was
so
violent
that
his
pride
of
character
the
sense
of
personal
dignity
the
presence
of
his
enemies
were
all
forgotten
in
a
moment
and
he
abandoned
himself
to
despair
unable
longer
to
sustain
himself
he
sank
on
his
knees
am
lost
he
cried
weeping
and
extending
his
hands
toward
his
persecutors
pity
on
me
my
lord
norfolk
i
give
up
all
to
the
king
let
him
do
with
me
what
he
will
since
he
says
i
am
culpable
although
i
have
never
had
the
intention
yet
i
will
acknowledge
that
i
am
but
alas
of
what
do
they
accuse
me
having
violated
the
statutes
of
præmunire
replied
norfolk
betraying
your
country
continued
suffolk
carrying
on
a
secret
correspondence
with
the
king
of
france
you
well
remember
that
it
was
you
who
had
me
recalled
at
the
moment
when
having
become
master
of
artois
and
picardy
i
had
the
parisians
trembling
within
their
walls
will
you
dare
deny
that
you
were
the
cause
of
it
and
that
it
was
the
of
mme
louise
induced
you
to
give
the
order
for
me
to
retire
the
king
has
been
already
long
enough
your
dupe
and
our
duty
was
to
enlighten
him
as
to
the
rest
my
lord
cardinal
you
understand
the
proceedings
your
advocate
ought
to
be
here
and
you
should
immediately
confer
with
him
with
regard
to
the
other
charges
herein
as
he
said
this
he
threw
on
the
table
the
bill
of
presentment
which
contained
no
less
than
chief
accusations
they
then
took
possession
of
all
the
papers
they
could
find
carrying
away
the
seal
of
state
and
left
wolsey
in
a
condition
deserving
pity
as
they
retired
they
proposed
sending
in
the
advocate
who
was
waiting
in
an
adjoining
apartment
conversing
with
cromwell
ha
you
are
here
then
sir
cromwell
said
the
duke
of
suffolk
laughing
in
go
in
there
at
once
he
cried
pointing
to
the
door
of
cabinet
cardinal
needs
you
i
fear
he
will
be
hard
to
cromwell
watched
with
great
anxiety
the
course
of
events
and
not
knowing
to
which
side
to
turn
determined
at
least
to
secure
for
himself
the
appearance
and
merit
of
fidelity
to
his
benefactor
without
reflecting
on
the
consequences
he
hastily
replied
that
he
would
not
leave
wolsey
would
never
abandon
him
but
follow
him
to
the
end
will
follow
him
to
the
end
eh
replied
suffolk
you
know
his
intended
destination
i
doubt
very
much
if
you
will
then
ask
to
follow
as
he
said
this
he
made
a
gesture
giving
cromwell
to
understand
that
his
master
besides
losing
place
and
power
was
also
in
danger
of
losing
his
head
treason
my
dear
sir
high
treason
cried
suffolk
you
hear
me
treason
repeated
cromwell
slowly
my
lord
duke
how
could
he
be
guilty
he
hastened
to
rejoin
wolsey
whom
he
found
bathed
in
tears
and
endeavoring
to
decipher
the
act
of
presentment
cromwell
exclaimed
the
unhappy
cardinal
on
seeing
him
dear
friend
you
have
not
then
forsaken
me
but
alas
i
am
lost
read
here
for
yourself
read
it
aloud
to
me
for
my
sight
is
cromwell
seized
the
paper
and
commenced
reading
the
accusation
on
hearing
that
it
was
based
principally
on
the
violation
of
the
statutes
of
præmunire
wolsey
was
unable
to
control
his
indignation
he
cried
the
king
be
induced
to
sanction
such
unparalleled
injustice
it
is
true
that
in
receiving
from
the
pope
the
title
of
legate
and
exercising
throughout
the
kingdom
the
authority
conferred
by
that
title
i
have
been
brought
in
opposition
to
the
precautionary
statutes
of
king
richard
but
still
i
have
not
violated
them
since
the
king
himself
has
sanctioned
that
power
and
recognized
it
by
appearing
in
his
own
person
before
the
court
is
he
not
more
to
blame
then
who
desired
and
ordered
it
than
i
who
have
simply
been
made
a
party
to
it
i
can
prove
this
he
cried
i
can
prove
it
for
i
have
still
the
signed
by
his
own
hand
and
which
he
furnished
me
to
that
effect
cromwell
look
in
my
secretary
you
will
find
them
cromwell
opened
the
secretary
but
found
nothing
is
not
a
single
paper
here
he
said
could
you
have
placed
them
exclaimed
the
cardinal
they
have
all
been
carried
away
all
he
repeated
have
no
longer
any
means
of
defence
i
am
lost
they
are
all
arrayed
against
me
they
have
resolved
upon
my
death
o
henry
o
my
king
is
it
thus
you
forget
in
one
moment
the
services
i
have
rendered
you
cromwell
he
continued
in
a
low
voice
and
gloomy
abstracted
manner
i
am
lost
the
same
evening
another
messenger
came
to
inform
the
unhappy
cardinal
the
king
wished
to
occupy
during
the
session
of
parliament
he
was
about
to
convene
his
palace
of
york
the
object
of
his
care
and
pride
and
that
in
leaving
it
he
could
retire
to
and
have
at
his
disposal
a
house
about
eight
leagues
from
london
entirely
abandoned
and
belonging
to
the
bishopric
of
winchester
the
night
already
far
advanced
found
sir
thomas
more
still
seated
in
his
cabinet
conversing
with
the
bishop
of
rochester
who
had
arrived
at
chelsea
very
late
that
morning
a
light
was
burning
on
a
long
table
encumbered
with
books
and
papers
several
chairs
covered
with
black
morocco
cast
their
shadows
on
the
walls
a
capacious
rug
of
white
was
spread
before
the
hearth
where
the
remains
of
a
fire
still
burned
in
the
grate
such
was
the
simplicity
of
the
home
of
sir
thomas
more
why
my
dear
friend
asked
the
bishop
of
rochester
you
consent
to
take
upon
your
shoulders
so
terrible
a
responsibility
once
become
chancellor
have
you
fully
considered
that
you
will
be
surrounded
by
enemies
who
will
watch
your
every
movement
and
pursue
you
even
to
your
death
have
you
reflected
well
that
you
acknowledge
no
other
laws
than
those
of
your
own
conscience
and
feel
no
remorse
unless
for
not
having
spoken
your
views
with
sufficient
candor
is
it
thus
you
hope
to
resist
thus
you
hope
to
escape
the
snares
that
will
continually
surround
you
fear
nothing
replied
more
i
believe
in
god
and
you
yourself
would
you
not
blame
such
weakness
in
refusing
the
king
i
refuse
the
queen
would
not
catherine
then
declare
that
the
trusted
servant
even
he
who
had
been
called
her
friend
had
sacrificed
her
interests
to
his
love
of
ease
he
had
declared
his
life
should
be
devoted
to
her
cause
and
now
had
abandoned
and
deprived
her
of
the
only
hope
of
relief
providence
seemed
to
have
left
her
no
fisher
friendship
has
rights
too
sacred
for
me
not
to
respect
cried
the
bishop
you
respect
the
rights
of
friendship
listen
to
my
appeal
i
ask
you
to
decline
a
dignity
that
will
prove
destructive
to
you
in
the
name
of
all
that
you
hold
most
dear
in
the
name
of
all
that
is
good
and
beautiful
in
nature
in
the
entire
universe
i
conjure
you
to
refuse
this
fatal
honor
it
is
more
than
probable
the
very
seal
they
wish
now
to
place
in
your
hands
will
be
very
soon
affixed
to
your
believe
me
my
friend
all
will
unite
against
you
a
deep
conviction
has
taken
possession
of
my
soul
and
i
see
i
feel
the
wrath
of
this
prince
as
violent
as
he
is
cruel
ready
to
fall
upon
your
devoted
head
you
will
be
crushed
in
this
struggle
too
unequal
to
admit
for
an
instant
the
hope
of
well
replied
more
laughingly
then
of
simply
inscribing
on
my
tombstone
lies
thomas
more
there
will
appear
in
pompous
style
the
inscription
lies
the
lord
high
chancellor
of
assuredly
i
think
that
would
sound
much
better
and
i
shall
take
care
to
bequeath
my
first
salary
to
defray
the
expense
of
so
elegant
an
cried
the
bishop
of
rochester
with
impatience
can
not
suffer
you
to
jest
on
a
subject
of
such
grave
importance
do
you
then
desire
to
die
would
you
ruin
yourself
trust
to
my
experience
i
know
the
heart
of
henry
thoroughly
your
attempt
to
save
the
queen
will
be
vain
and
you
will
inevitably
be
involved
in
her
ruin
i
conjure
you
then
accept
not
this
office
i
will
myself
carry
your
refusal
to
the
no
exclaimed
more
have
decided
decided
repeated
rochester
whom
the
thought
reduced
almost
to
despair
i
see
it
you
have
become
ambitious
the
vainglory
of
the
world
the
fatal
infatuation
of
its
honors
have
taken
possession
even
of
the
soul
of
thomas
more
your
heart
no
longer
responds
to
mine
your
ear
remains
deaf
to
all
my
solicitations
ah
well
since
the
desire
of
being
honored
among
men
and
to
have
them
grovel
at
your
feet
has
made
even
you
despise
my
counsel
and
advice
then
listen
listen
well
and
god
grant
that
i
may
be
able
to
destroy
in
your
heart
the
poison
that
pride
has
poured
into
it
you
are
willing
to
sacrifice
to
your
vanity
all
the
happiness
all
the
quiet
and
peace
of
your
future
know
then
what
recompense
will
be
meted
out
to
you
yesterday
wolsey
was
in
a
manner
driven
from
his
palace
and
descended
the
thames
in
a
common
boat
cromwell
alone
accompanying
him
for
all
have
deserted
him
except
his
enemies
who
in
order
to
enjoy
his
calamities
crowded
the
river
in
boats
and
followed
after
him
they
hoped
to
see
him
arrested
and
carried
to
the
tower
the
report
having
been
circulated
that
he
would
be
taken
there
wolsey
he
whom
you
have
so
often
seen
make
his
appearance
in
parliament
surrounded
by
an
almost
royal
pomp
and
splendor
is
now
a
fugitive
alone
abandoned
without
defence
of
the
clamorous
insults
and
bitter
scorn
of
a
populace
always
eager
to
feast
their
eyes
on
the
ruins
of
fallen
greatness
the
air
around
him
resounded
with
their
maledictions
is
the
man
who
fattened
on
the
blood
of
the
poor
they
cried
taxes
will
be
reduced
now
exclaimed
others
he
will
have
no
farther
use
for
palaces
and
and
all
in
their
ignorance
abused
him
as
the
cause
of
the
wrongs
and
oppressions
which
it
was
probably
not
in
his
power
to
have
averted
at
length
overwhelmed
with
insults
and
outrages
he
was
landed
at
pultney
and
in
order
to
escape
the
mob
was
hurriedly
conducted
to
his
house
at
asher
where
he
has
been
banished
such
is
the
reward
you
will
receive
in
the
service
of
an
avaricious
prince
and
a
blind
infatuated
multitude
he
paused
overcome
by
anxiety
and
excitement
dear
fisher
responded
more
deeply
moved
hearts
and
thoughts
are
always
in
unison
you
have
only
represented
to
me
a
second
time
the
picture
i
had
already
painted
cried
rochester
do
you
still
hesitate
replied
more
resolutely
does
it
require
so
much
hesitation
to
sacrifice
self
i
would
not
wish
to
live
dishonored
and
i
should
consider
myself
guilty
if
i
forgot
my
duty
toward
my
sovereign
and
the
honor
of
england
you
are
resolved
ah
well
let
your
sacrifice
be
accomplished
said
the
saintly
bishop
then
may
god
whose
goodness
is
infinite
hear
my
vows
and
grant
my
prayer
may
the
same
dangers
unite
us
side
by
side
with
you
may
my
last
sigh
be
breathed
out
with
yours
and
if
the
life
of
the
aged
man
is
not
extinguished
before
that
of
the
man
in
his
prime
then
may
the
stroke
of
death
cut
us
down
at
the
same
moment
dear
friend
cried
more
many
years
that
have
passed
over
your
head
and
blanched
your
locks
have
not
yet
ripened
your
judgment
since
you
can
believe
it
possible
that
the
anger
although
it
may
one
day
fall
on
me
could
ever
be
permitted
to
overtake
you
the
counsellor
of
his
youth
whom
he
has
so
often
called
his
father
no
i
can
conceive
of
no
such
fearful
possibility
the
wise
the
virtuous
bishop
of
rochester
can
never
be
involved
in
the
misfortune
that
would
crush
thomas
replied
fisher
i
shall
understand
how
to
call
down
on
my
head
the
vengeance
with
which
he
may
hesitate
to
strike
me
believe
me
more
a
man
scarcely
reaches
the
prime
of
life
before
he
feels
himself
as
it
were
daily
beginning
to
fail
just
as
in
the
autumn
days
the
light
rapidly
diminishes
so
the
passing
years
despoil
his
body
of
physical
strength
and
beauty
but
it
has
no
effect
upon
his
soul
the
heart
no
the
heart
never
grows
old
it
loves
it
suffers
as
in
the
early
morning
of
life
and
when
at
last
it
has
reached
the
age
when
wisdom
and
experience
have
destroyed
the
illusions
of
the
passions
friendship
strengthened
by
so
many
blessed
memories
reigns
there
alone
and
entire
like
a
magnificent
flower
that
has
been
sheltered
and
preserved
from
the
destroying
worm
almost
arrived
at
the
end
of
his
career
he
often
takes
a
survey
of
the
road
he
has
passed
over
he
loves
to
recall
his
joys
and
his
sorrows
and
to
weep
again
for
the
friends
he
has
lost
i
know
that
presumptuous
youth
imagines
that
the
prudence
he
refuses
to
obey
is
the
only
good
that
remains
after
the
labors
of
life
have
been
terminated
by
time
feelings
are
not
in
unison
with
those
of
an
old
man
it
is
because
you
do
not
understand
them
he
lives
in
memory
and
you
in
hope
you
pursue
a
phantom
a
chimera
the
nothingness
of
which
he
has
already
experienced
you
accuse
him
he
complains
of
you
and
often
you
do
not
deign
to
regard
the
last
bitter
tear
that
is
drawn
from
him
at
the
sight
of
the
tomb
into
which
he
must
soon
exclaimed
more
whom
i
venerate
as
a
father
and
love
as
a
friend
can
you
doubt
for
one
moment
the
truth
of
a
heart
entirely
devoted
to
you
confirmed
by
your
example
guided
and
sustained
by
your
counsels
what
have
i
to
fear
banish
from
your
mind
these
sad
presentiments
why
should
this
dread
of
the
future
that
perhaps
after
all
is
only
chimerical
destroy
the
extreme
happiness
i
enjoy
in
seeing
you
for
a
long
time
they
continued
to
converse
until
the
light
of
early
morning
at
length
succeeded
the
uncertain
glimmer
of
the
candle
now
flickering
in
its
socket
friend
i
must
leave
you
said
rochester
day
already
dawns
god
grant
the
sun
may
not
this
morning
arise
on
the
beginning
of
your
misfortunes
no
replied
more
is
my
thomas
will
pray
for
and
protect
the
good
bishop
then
descended
to
the
courtyard
and
mounted
his
mule
but
more
unwilling
to
give
him
up
walked
on
by
his
side
as
far
as
the
road
followed
the
course
of
the
river
when
they
reached
the
where
the
bishop
turned
off
more
shook
his
hand
and
bade
him
farewell
a
great
wooden
cross
stood
near
the
roadside
on
which
was
suspended
a
wreath
of
withered
leaves
and
more
seating
himself
on
one
of
the
stone
steps
upon
which
the
cross
was
elevated
followed
the
good
bishop
with
his
eyes
until
he
had
disappeared
in
the
distance
he
then
rested
his
head
sadly
on
his
hands
and
recalled
to
mind
all
this
venerable
friend
had
said
to
him
is
right
he
mentally
exclaimed
his
friendship
renders
him
into
what
a
sea
of
agitation
malignity
and
hatred
i
shall
be
plunged
and
all
for
what
in
order
that
i
may
be
lord
chancellor
of
the
kingdom
through
which
this
road
passes
behold
then
beside
the
highway
he
added
looking
around
him
lord
the
great
high
chancellor
shivering
in
the
cold
morning
air
just
as
any
other
man
would
do
who
had
gone
out
at
this
hour
without
putting
on
his
cloak
yes
i
can
understand
how
social
distinctions
might
cause
us
to
scorn
other
men
if
they
exempted
us
from
the
inconveniences
of
life
we
might
then
perhaps
believe
that
we
had
different
natures
but
let
us
change
our
garments
and
we
fall
at
once
and
are
immediately
confounded
with
the
common
while
making
these
sad
reflections
upon
the
follies
of
human
nature
more
arose
and
returned
to
the
house
where
his
wife
and
children
and
his
aged
father
simple
and
peaceable
old
man
happy
in
the
favor
of
the
king
and
the
virtues
of
his
son
were
all
wrapped
in
profound
slumber
in
a
spacious
apartment
of
which
the
dark
and
ceiling
ragged
tapestry
and
dilapidated
windows
presented
the
appearance
of
a
desolate
and
abandoned
edifice
a
fragment
of
broken
furniture
still
remained
upon
which
was
placed
a
small
piece
of
bread
numberless
crumbs
strewed
the
dusty
floor
and
were
eagerly
devoured
by
a
little
mouse
but
recently
the
only
inhabitant
of
the
place
however
he
had
the
company
of
a
man
whose
extraordinary
mind
had
conceived
vast
projects
and
executed
great
and
useful
enterprises
the
archbishop
of
york
cardinal
wolsey
seated
upon
the
edge
of
a
wooden
stool
which
he
had
placed
in
the
embrasure
of
a
window
he
held
his
hands
crossed
one
upon
the
other
and
bitterly
reflected
upon
his
unhappy
destiny
regrets
of
which
he
felt
all
the
impotency
pressed
upon
his
agitated
soul
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
still
heard
the
cries
and
menaces
of
the
furious
populace
that
exulted
in
his
distress
and
to
which
perhaps
alas
he
would
again
be
subjected
at
one
time
filled
with
courage
and
resolution
at
another
humble
and
cast
down
the
anxieties
of
his
mind
seemed
wholly
without
measure
his
eyes
wearied
with
straying
listlessly
over
the
plain
which
extended
before
him
beheld
only
a
single
laborer
ploughing
the
field
is
small
said
he
presence
of
immensity
the
point
which
he
forms
in
space
is
imperceptible
entire
generations
have
passed
away
have
gathered
the
fruits
of
the
earth
and
now
sleep
in
their
native
dust
my
name
has
been
unknown
to
them
millions
of
creatures
suffer
where
i
exist
free
from
pain
coming
up
from
the
lowest
ranks
of
society
i
have
endeavored
to
elevate
myself
above
them
and
what
has
my
existence
signified
to
them
has
not
each
one
considered
himself
the
common
centre
around
which
all
the
others
must
revolve
here
wolsey
impelled
by
extreme
hunger
approached
the
little
table
and
took
up
the
morsel
of
dry
bread
left
from
his
repast
the
evening
before
just
as
he
was
raising
it
to
his
mouth
a
man
entered
dressed
in
the
most
scrupulous
manner
and
enveloped
in
an
ample
cloak
of
the
finest
material
wolsey
was
startled
and
gazed
at
him
in
astonishment
arundel
he
exclaimed
at
last
could
have
brought
you
to
this
place
replied
arundel
in
a
frank
abrupt
manner
have
lost
everything
and
have
never
informed
me
by
a
word
do
you
think
then
i
have
forgotten
all
you
have
done
for
me
favors
i
have
conferred
on
you
were
so
slight
replied
wolsey
it
would
have
been
natural
you
should
have
no
longer
remembered
them
especially
since
many
who
owe
their
wealth
and
perhaps
their
lives
to
me
have
so
completely
forgotten
have
never
learned
how
to
flatter
nor
to
wear
velvet
gloves
replied
arundel
i
am
still
more
ignorant
of
the
art
of
forgetting
past
favors
no
it
has
never
been
my
custom
to
act
thus
and
you
have
offended
me
more
than
you
imagine
by
proving
you
believed
me
capable
of
such
as
he
said
this
arundel
took
from
his
bosom
an
immense
purse
of
red
satin
filled
with
gold
and
laid
it
on
the
dilapidated
table
beside
a
package
of
clothing
which
he
had
thoughtfully
added
to
his
gift
are
no
acknowledgments
to
be
made
he
remarked
is
essential
first
of
all
that
you
be
made
comfortable
you
can
return
this
when
it
suits
your
convenience
now
let
us
say
no
more
about
cried
wolsey
you
not
aware
then
that
i
may
never
be
able
to
return
it
they
will
divide
my
ecclesiastical
benefices
among
them
the
duke
of
norfolk
and
the
earl
of
wiltshire
have
already
been
put
in
possession
of
the
revenue
from
my
bishopric
of
winchester
this
is
the
only
food
i
have
had
since
i
came
here
he
added
showing
him
the
bread
he
still
held
in
his
hand
it
is
not
very
delicate
replied
arundel
it
is
your
own
fault
when
one
has
friends
he
should
not
neglect
them
and
that
is
just
what
you
have
often
renders
us
unjust
answered
the
cardinal
deeply
moved
by
the
generous
frankness
and
brusque
proceedings
of
arundel
whom
he
had
always
until
now
regarded
as
being
haughty
and
ungrateful
because
he
had
never
observed
him
among
his
crowd
of
fawning
courtiers
must
confess
that
i
could
not
endure
the
thought
of
being
repulsed
by
those
for
whom
i
have
done
everything
i
do
not
believe
that
among
the
immense
number
of
those
who
daily
wearied
me
with
protestations
of
their
ostentatious
regard
there
is
one
who
has
condescended
to
think
of
me
in
my
misfortunes
you
only
have
thought
to
succor
me
in
my
distress
you
who
without
my
being
aware
of
it
have
doubtless
been
all
the
while
the
most
sincere
among
them
can
not
believe
replied
arundel
without
appearing
to
notice
the
acknowledgments
with
which
wolsey
continued
to
overwhelm
him
they
would
all
thus
have
abandoned
you
had
they
known
the
extreme
severity
with
which
you
have
been
treated
it
would
be
too
foul
a
blot
upon
the
name
of
humanity
notwithstanding
they
laugh
at
our
misfortunes
i
think
it
appears
worse
to
us
than
it
really
is
no
be
assured
you
will
find
some
faithful
friends
who
will
defend
you
for
instance
sir
thomas
more
your
successor
whose
fortune
you
have
made
can
not
fail
to
use
his
influence
in
your
owes
me
nothing
replied
the
cardinal
have
not
made
his
fortune
when
i
proposed
him
to
the
king
as
treasurer
of
the
exchequer
he
had
for
a
long
time
been
acquainted
with
his
rare
merits
knowing
that
the
appointment
would
prove
both
useful
and
agreeable
to
the
king
i
recommended
him
to
make
it
but
really
it
was
more
for
the
benefit
than
besides
i
am
aware
that
more
is
one
of
the
most
zealous
partisans
of
catherine
thus
you
see
there
exists
no
reason
why
he
should
feel
inclined
to
assist
me
i
am
only
surprised
that
a
man
of
his
exalted
integrity
should
accept
a
position
where
he
will
necessarily
be
compelled
to
act
in
opposition
to
his
is
with
the
eager
desire
of
ultimately
being
able
to
convert
all
the
world
and
to
correct
all
consciences
replied
arundel
with
a
smile
of
derision
for
he
never
lost
an
occasion
of
ridiculing
the
importance
which
many
attach
to
political
intrigues
and
as
they
say
to
the
public
good
in
whose
management
they
pretend
to
take
a
hand
in
order
to
win
admiration
at
any
cost
for
their
talents
verily
he
will
find
it
difficult
to
sustain
his
position
unless
he
becomes
the
very
humble
servant
of
my
lady
anne
regent
of
the
kingdom
for
nothing
is
done
but
what
she
ordains
and
her
uncle
whom
she
has
appointed
chief
of
the
council
executes
the
orders
which
the
king
claims
the
honor
of
communicating
to
him
oh
continued
arundel
in
the
same
ironical
tone
and
without
perceiving
the
painful
effect
his
words
produced
on
the
unhappy
cardinal
it
is
a
very
great
advantage
and
above
all
highly
honorable
for
england
to
see
her
king
put
in
tutelage
to
the
caprices
of
a
woman
as
weak
and
vain
as
she
is
arrogant
if
he
was
absolutely
determined
to
go
into
why
did
he
not
beseech
the
good
queen
catherine
to
take
charge
of
him
she
at
least
would
have
been
careful
to
hold
the
reins
equally
on
both
sides
so
that
the
swaddling
could
have
been
made
to
walk
swaddling
repeated
wolsey
who
devoured
his
nurse
my
dear
lord
continued
arundel
can
not
be
denied
that
you
have
made
a
great
mistake
in
encouraging
the
king
in
his
divorce
project
yes
a
great
mistake
which
they
now
begin
to
discover
but
i
do
wrong
perhaps
to
reproach
you
since
you
are
the
first
to
be
punished
for
your
manner
of
seeing
things
but
listen
to
me
as
for
myself
if
in
order
to
avoid
dying
of
starvation
or
being
compelled
to
subsist
on
just
such
bread
as
you
have
there
i
had
been
obliged
to
accept
the
place
of
lord
chancellor
on
the
day
when
i
found
myself
relieved
of
so
burdensome
and
exacting
an
office
i
should
have
cried
aloud
heaven
that
i
am
again
seated
by
my
own
fireside
where
in
peace
and
quiet
i
can
get
up
at
my
leisure
and
contemplate
passing
for
myself
these
are
my
principles
to
have
nothing
to
do
is
the
first
essential
to
happiness
nothing
to
lose
the
second
nothing
to
disturb
or
annoy
the
third
and
upon
these
rest
all
the
others
such
is
my
system
the
best
of
all
systems
the
arundel
would
have
still
continued
explaining
the
numerous
theories
he
had
originated
for
securing
happiness
for
an
indefinite
length
of
time
perhaps
but
he
suddenly
perceived
that
wolsey
no
longer
heard
him
but
with
his
head
sunk
on
his
breast
seemed
absorbed
in
thought
my
lord
said
arundel
are
not
listening
to
me
it
seems
really
it
is
not
worth
while
to
explain
to
you
the
true
method
of
being
my
dear
arundel
replied
wolsey
aroused
by
the
exclamation
of
his
visitor
could
you
expect
me
to
think
of
profiting
by
your
lessons
or
to
make
an
application
of
your
theories
of
happiness
when
at
this
very
moment
perhaps
i
have
been
condemned
to
death
by
parliament
is
no
proof
of
that
replied
arundel
unto
the
day
is
the
evil
gloomy
apprehensions
profit
us
nothing
they
do
not
delay
the
progress
of
events
on
the
contrary
they
send
them
on
us
in
advance
and
only
serve
to
aggravate
the
consequences
moreover
i
must
not
forget
to
suggest
that
if
it
would
be
more
agreeable
for
you
to
be
with
your
friends
there
are
many
who
will
be
happy
to
receive
you
and
offer
you
a
mansion
as
commodious
although
less
sumptuously
furnished
than
your
palace
of
york
or
that
of
hampton
court
the
latter
of
which
i
have
never
liked
since
you
added
the
is
that
gallery
to
me
now
i
surrender
it
up
to
you
said
the
cardinal
the
endless
arguments
of
arundel
began
to
weary
him
exceedingly
in
spite
of
the
extreme
gratitude
he
felt
for
his
sincere
and
generous
offers
wolsey
could
not
divest
himself
of
the
conviction
that
arundel
belonged
to
that
class
who
while
in
other
respects
full
of
good
impulses
and
laudable
intentions
are
so
entirely
wanting
in
tact
and
delicacy
and
contend
so
urgently
for
their
own
opinions
that
the
consolations
they
would
force
you
to
adopt
far
from
alleviating
your
sufferings
only
augment
them
and
render
their
sympathy
irksome
and
oppressive
this
feeling
was
experienced
by
wolsey
uncertain
as
he
was
what
fate
was
reserved
for
him
trembling
even
for
his
life
while
arundel
endeavored
to
paint
for
him
a
minute
picture
of
the
happiness
and
tranquillity
enjoyed
by
a
man
living
in
peace
and
quiet
with
nothing
to
disturb
him
in
the
enjoyment
of
his
possessions
he
exclaimed
at
length
impatiently
has
not
kind
providence
blessed
me
with
a
nature
like
yours
i
should
be
less
unhappy
nor
every
instant
see
yawning
before
me
the
terrible
depths
of
the
precipice
on
which
i
now
stand
i
could
catch
at
least
at
the
branches
of
absurdity
until
the
moment
when
i
should
be
dashed
to
pieces
but
no
i
can
not
i
am
too
well
acquainted
with
men
and
things
to
expect
the
slightest
assistance
they
are
always
ready
to
strike
those
who
are
falling
but
never
attempt
to
raise
them
up
yesterday
only
yesterday
the
commissioners
of
parliament
demanded
of
me
the
i
had
received
from
the
king
in
order
to
exercise
my
authority
as
legate
although
every
one
knew
that
as
he
had
given
them
to
me
it
was
his
right
alone
to
take
them
away
again
ah
well
they
have
persisted
in
their
demand
and
have
refused
to
believe
me
on
oath
no
i
will
indulge
in
no
more
illusions
my
enemies
have
sworn
my
death
and
they
will
obtain
it
and
the
king
the
king
my
master
after
fifteen
years
of
the
most
faithful
service
he
delivers
me
up
helpless
and
defenceless
to
all
the
cruelties
their
hatred
may
inspire
and
yet
you
arundel
think
that
i
should
still
indulge
in
hope
all
this
will
be
arranged
i
tell
you
replied
arundel
with
an
imperturbable
coolness
should
not
trouble
yourself
in
advance
because
if
the
worst
happen
it
will
change
nothing
and
if
it
does
your
present
suffering
will
have
been
as
arundel
finished
this
wise
reasoning
cromwell
appeared
he
came
from
london
where
he
had
been
he
said
to
defend
wolsey
before
the
parliament
on
seeing
him
enter
the
cardinal
was
seized
with
an
uncontrollable
alarm
thinking
his
fate
had
been
decided
he
cried
and
could
say
no
more
replied
cromwell
should
not
thus
give
way
to
your
apprehensions
he
paused
on
seeing
the
cardinal
grow
deadly
pale
need
have
no
uneasiness
because
the
king
has
sent
norris
to
bid
me
assure
you
he
would
take
you
under
his
have
been
condemned
then
cried
the
unhappy
wolsey
cromwell
speak
conceal
nothing
from
me
i
am
not
a
child
he
added
with
firmness
have
been
condemned
by
the
star
chamber
but
the
king
says
he
will
have
the
bill
rejected
in
the
house
of
commons
replied
cromwell
will
not
do
it
cried
wolsey
the
tears
coursing
rapidly
down
his
cheeks
will
sacrifice
me
cromwell
i
know
it
he
has
no
longer
any
use
for
me
and
my
past
services
have
left
no
impression
on
his
mind
but
how
far
has
their
rage
carried
them
to
what
have
they
condemned
me
have
been
placed
beyond
the
protection
of
the
king
and
all
your
property
protection
is
already
recovered
gently
interrupted
arundel
who
had
listened
until
this
time
in
silence
for
the
confiscation
that
will
be
more
difficult
inasmuch
as
they
are
generally
more
ready
to
take
than
to
give
however
my
dear
cardinal
you
should
despair
of
nothing
then
let
us
try
and
console
you
they
can
not
confiscate
me
who
have
never
had
anything
to
do
with
the
gentlemen
of
the
council
i
have
a
good
house
an
excellent
cook
you
will
come
home
with
me
and
my
word
for
it
you
shall
want
for
interrupted
the
cardinal
am
deeply
grateful
for
your
kind
offer
but
believe
me
they
will
not
leave
me
the
choice
of
profiting
by
not
why
not
exclaimed
arundel
devil
why
these
gentlemen
of
the
council
are
not
wild
beasts
a
little
avaricious
a
little
ambitious
a
little
envious
and
slightly
selfish
but
they
are
at
least
as
accommodating
as
the
devil
replied
wolsey
assure
you
before
receiving
the
message
said
cromwell
was
in
despair
for
they
spoke
of
having
you
arrested
and
immediately
urging
the
accusation
of
high
treason
but
since
the
king
has
declared
you
under
his
protection
i
do
not
believe
that
all
is
entirely
lost
norris
has
repeated
to
me
twenty
times
positively
to
the
cardinal
that
the
king
advises
him
not
to
be
troubled
and
to
remember
that
he
can
give
him
any
moment
he
pleases
far
more
than
they
can
take
hope
i
may
be
mistaken
dear
cromwell
replied
the
cardinal
with
a
sombre
air
i
fear
a
momentary
compassion
only
has
excited
the
king
to
say
what
you
tell
me
and
it
will
not
be
long
before
that
wicked
will
again
have
possession
of
his
ear
she
will
not
fail
to
use
her
influence
in
defaming
me
and
blackening
anew
all
my
actions
until
the
king
will
cease
to
oppose
the
wicked
designs
they
have
conceived
against
saying
this
he
buried
his
face
in
his
hands
and
sank
into
a
state
of
despondency
impossible
to
describe
cromwell
made
no
reply
and
arundel
silently
took
his
leave
inwardly
congratulating
himself
as
he
returned
home
upon
the
tranquil
and
happy
life
he
knew
so
well
how
to
lead
and
censuring
those
who
would
not
imitate
his
example
without
once
reflecting
that
few
were
in
a
position
so
agreeable
or
independent
as
his
and
consequently
were
not
able
to
enjoy
themselves
equally
nor
after
his
own
deliberate
fashion
to
be
continued
sine
labe
concepta
predestined
second
eve
for
this
immaculate
not
lower
than
the
first
chosen
beginner
in
the
loss

and
mediatress
in
the
gain
achieved
when
the
new
angel
as
the
old
believed
thy
hearkening
should
bless
whom
had
curst
and
therefore
we
whose
bondage
thou
hast
burst
grateful
for
our
inheritance
retrieved
must
deem
this
jewel
in
thy
diadem

i
said
you
know
anything
about
l
in
cheshire
county
jones
who
had
been
meditatively
examining
the
coloring
of
a
meerschaum
sat
up
erect
at
this
question
with
a
sudden
access
of
vigor
he
said
george
where
agnes
cortland
lives
now
in
the
it
was
the
middle
week
of
july
aspirations
for
one
whiff
of
the
breeze
among
the
hills
had
become
irresistible
we
were
sitting
together
jones
and
i
in
my
room
after
luncheon
jones
was
a
young
new
york
artist
in
his
first
season
after
his
return
from
italy
the
previous
autumn
he
too
was
about
to
start
on
a
sketching
tour
through
vermont
in
which
state
his
people
lived
he
was
late
leaving
town
but
money
was
not
easy
with
him
a
handsome
young
fellow
of
that
golden
age
between
and
when
one
is
apt
to
think
he
needs
only
a
very
lever
to
move
the
world
he
was
of
medium
height
but
squarely
and
powerfully
built
with
a
face
but
very
resolute
in
expression
a
stranger
would
not
be
likely
to
take
a
liberty
with
him
i
had
a
strong
notion
that
jones
would
make
a
better
soldier
than
artist
if
there
were
any
question
of
blows
being
struck
for
the
country
which
happily
there
is
not
but
hitherto
i
had
shrewdly
kept
that
opinion
to
myself
considerably
older
than
he
was
and
engaged
in
another
occupation
circumstances
had
thrown
us
a
good
deal
together
intimacy
had
brought
confidence
and
confidence
at
his
age
meant
nothing
more
nor
less
than
it
always
does
under
such
circumstances
the
unbosoming
of
his
love
affairs
how
few
there
are
who
have
not
found
themselves
in
the
same
position
either
as
actors
or
sympathetic
chorus
or
in
time
as
both
what
countless
dramas
of
passion
are
continually
being
put
upon
the
private
stage
before
this
limited
audience
now
it
is
not
the
purpose
of
this
paper
to
pursue
the
history
of
captivity
at
the
hands
of
the
tender
goddess
through
all
the
infinitesimal
and
transcendental
chapters
a
first
romance
runs
into
more
placid
emotions
and
observations
befitting
the
serenity
of
approaching
middle
age
are
in
store
for
the
reader
and
in
fact
the
history
of
passion
is
still
incomplete
but
so
much
of
it
may
be
given
as
fell
within
the
purview
of
our
new
hampshire
observations
jones
was
poor
prosaic
fact
which
robs
life
of
so
many
compensations
as
we
grow
old
but
at
we
spurn
the
mastery
of
the
glittering
dross
that
is
if
congress
gives
us
any
to
spurn
let
us
say
rather
of
the
flimsy
paper
at
that
age
of
our
flowing
life
we
coin
money
at
our
own
mint
or
more
truly
draw
limitless
drafts
on
the
bank
of
the
future
happy
the
man
who
meets
them
when
they
fall
due
jones
at
least
had
no
doubts
as
to
his
future
solvency
but
his
plans
were
vague
very
agnes
cortland
was
the
daughter
of
a
railroad
director
or
two
or
three
directors
rolled
into
one
and
had
the
world
or
at
least
the
new
york
world
to
choose
from
poor
jones
his
story
might
almost
be
predicted
from
the
start
yet
this
inheritor
of
the
latent
genius
of
any
masters
ancient
or
modern
you
choose
to
name
believed
perhaps
with
some
reason
that
this
daughter
of
dives
liked
him
and
as
for
himself
he
vowed
with
hyperbole
that
he
adored
her
they
had
frequently
met
their
families
then
being
neighbors
in
the
country
before
he
went
to
italy
where
he
had
spent
two
years
studying
and
wandering
about
no
avowal
of
affection
had
been
made
between
them
but
he
had
gone
away
with
the
consciousness
many
little
signs
and
tokens
give
that
he
was
not
disliked
since
his
return
a
year
ago
some
meetings
had
taken
place
at
rarer
intervals
in
society
at
an
evening
party
some
months
before
she
had
given
him
he
said
a
slight
but
unmistakable
opportunity
of
declaring
himself
if
he
had
wished
to
do
so
i
did
not
take
it
said
jones
who
spite
of
his
being
in
love
was
as
manly
a
young
fellow
as
one
could
meet
knows
i
am
poor
and
i
want
to
be
thought
a
i
laughed
at
this
quixotic
declaration
dear
fellow
i
said
fly
at
high
game
but
i
should
not
let
the
sacra
interfere
one
way
or
the
other
with
my
tender
emotions
if
i
did
so
at
all
plutus
would
have
his
due
weight
in
the
scale
believe
me
would
you
do
said
jones
this
was
in
one
of
those
in
early
spring
if
so
they
might
be
called
where
one
only
smoked
and
the
other
looked
on
with
sympathy
for
i
had
abandoned
the
some
years
before
hardly
of
such
profundity
nor
yet
so
silent
as
those
carlyle
speaks
of
jones
had
recurred
to
his
usual
topic
of
hopes
and
perplexities
i
answered
looking
at
him
retrospectively
as
it
were
as
if
contemplating
my
own
departed
youth
as
he
sat
there
in
his
favorite
attitude
after
dinner
gracefully
balancing
one
leg
over
the
arm
of
my
while
i
was
stretched
out
on
the
sofa
that
is
an
easy
question
to
propound
but
not
so
easy
to
answer
at
your
age
i
should
not
think
you
would
need
much
prompting
but
if
you
ask
me
i
would
say
leave
it
alone
love
is
a
luxury
for
the
rich
or
the
poor
but
you
are
not
likely
to
take
that
advice
a
good
deal
would
depend
on
the
reinforcements
she
might
bring
to
the
struggle
a
woman
is
not
always
a
passive
instrument
in
those
affairs
but
sometimes
has
a
will
of
her
own
i
have
never
seen
your
fair
one
and
know
nothing
about
her
but
if
she
be
a
girl
of
some
strength
of
character
and
her
love
do
not
prove
a
mere
fancy
she
might
possibly
gain
her
consent
but
it
is
not
a
promising
adventure
at
the
best
and
i
would
not
recommend
you
to
embark
your
hopes
in
it
keep
clear
of
serious
entanglements
until
you
see
your
way
before
you
above
all
avoid
anything
like
a
clandestine
engagement
it
will
not
add
to
your
happiness
or
hers
i
suppose
you
will
think
this
a
very
encouraging
opinion
but
there
may
be
circumstances
in
your
favor
i
know
nothing
of
marry
her
if
you
can
and
can
get
the
consent
and
go
into
with
him
in
his
office
you
will
make
more
money
at
that
than
you
are
ever
likely
to
do
sticking
little
dabs
of
color
on
a
piece
of
i
saw
jones
wince
at
this
mercenary
view
of
his
art
but
he
bore
it
like
a
man
and
continued
silent
the
suggestion
of
such
a
change
of
vocation
did
not
appear
to
surprise
him
though
it
was
plain
no
active
intention
of
throwing
up
his
art
had
yet
entered
his
mind
the
fact
is
jones
is
one
of
those
young
men
not
inconsiderable
in
numbers
in
the
profession
who
a
studio
but
are
not
likely
ever
to
send
many
out
of
it
developing
some
precocious
talent
for
drawing
when
they
are
boys
and
seizing
with
boyish
eagerness
upon
the
suggestion
of
being
artist
they
are
offered
by
fond
but
undiscerning
parents
upon
the
altar
of
art
but
they
never
advance
beyond
a
mechanical
dexterity
in
putting
conventional
scenes
upon
canvas
they
a
spark
of
that
genius
that
is
often
observed
where
other
pursuits
have
prevented
a
devotion
to
the
profession
eventually
they
abandon
altogether
the
study
or
practice
of
their
art
or
sink
into
drudges
for
the
picture
or
chromo
dealers
or
grind
out
a
living
as
or
heaven
knows
how
i
will
not
say
that
jones
was
altogether
deficient
in
talent
but
the
talent
that
makes
an
agreeable
accomplishment
for
the
rich
amateur
is
a
different
thing
from
that
which
will
pay
the
piper
or
win
eminence
in
the
art
jones
painted
his
pictures
for
the
autumn
and
spring
exhibitions
and
had
one
or
two
on
view
in
one
of
the
windows
but
at
du
big
sale
i
know
that
a
clever
little
bit
of
coloring
on
which
he
had
spent
some
time
was
knocked
down
to
a
for
sixteen
dollars
how
was
he
going
to
live
on
such
prices
and
as
for
marrying
agnes
cortland
it
was
simply
preposterous
to
think
of
it
nor
is
this
redundancy
of
young
native
artists
on
whom
neither
genius
nor
fashion
smiles
confined
to
new
york
alone
in
boston
which
is
the
only
other
city
boasting
of
a
native
school
of
art
the
same
low
prices
prevail
it
is
disheartening
but
a
more
disheartening
thing
still
is
that
those
prices
often
represented
the
actual
value
of
the
picture
jones
was
imperfectly
educated
though
his
continental
travel
had
made
him
a
fair
linguist
he
certainly
drew
very
little
inspiration
from
the
antique
for
he
knew
next
to
nothing
about
it
nor
had
he
much
of
that
sympathy
with
the
undercurrent
of
life
and
its
relations
with
nature
which
gives
significance
to
common
things
he
had
a
fondness
for
pleasure
which
of
course
did
not
contribute
to
his
success
yet
he
was
one
of
those
young
fellows
whom
it
is
impossible
to
meet
without
liking
he
was
frank
honorable
and
spirited
and
had
a
robust
shrewdness
about
him
in
dealing
with
men
and
things
that
made
him
a
pleasant
companion
that
he
would
eventually
choose
a
more
active
kind
of
life
and
probably
succeed
in
it
i
was
and
my
advice
about
though
spoken
partly
in
jest
was
inwardly
meant
in
good
faith
on
this
particular
july
evening
on
which
our
paper
opens
jones
followed
up
the
announcement
of
my
proposed
trip
to
l
by
expressing
a
wish
that
he
were
going
there
too
so
that
he
might
come
to
a
definite
understanding
with
agnes
cortland
and
the
wish
was
soon
followed
by
the
determination
to
act
on
it
long
do
you
intend
to
stay
there
he
asked
the
first
week
in
september
i
said
i
will
come
back
that
way
and
join
you
for
a
few
days
about
the
first
of
september
the
cortlands
leave
there
till
october
we
can
come
back
to
new
york
it
would
have
been
ungracious
on
my
part
to
have
objected
to
this
proposal
though
i
had
a
good
many
doubts
about
its
wisdom
so
it
happened
that
my
little
excursion
to
l
which
i
had
innocently
designed
to
be
a
season
of
simple
such
as
tennyson
ascribes
to
his
olympian
deities
upon
the
hills
together
careless
of
mankind
was
complicated
by
a
subordinate
interest
in
a
comedy
from
real
life
which
had
that
quiet
village
for
a
stage
the
next
day
i
started
taking
boston
that
staid
quiet
cleanly
city
seems
always
to
be
compared
with
new
york
like
a
good
by
the
side
of
a
big
blustering
brother
fonder
of
a
street
row
than
his
books
then
to
fitchburg
where
i
stopped
over
night
as
some
stage
travelling
was
to
be
done
from
our
place
and
riding
over
the
country
roads
in
the
morning
was
more
promising
than
on
a
dark
and
cloudy
night
in
the
morning
the
fitchburg
railroad
again
and
one
of
its
branches
to
l
the
unwonted
coolness
of
the
morning
breeze
as
the
train
entered
the
new
hampshire
hills
already
began
to
refresh
mind
and
body
alike
the
pines
and
hemlocks
extending
back
into
deep
dim
recesses
carpeted
with
moss
and
ferns
the
cattle
moving
slowly
over
the
pastures
in
the
distance
the
pastures
themselves
stretching
up
the
sides
of
the
highest
hills
still
of
the
freshest
green
without
a
hint
of
the
yellow
undertone
that
i
watched
gradually
overspread
them
as
the
summer
ripened
into
autumn
a
lake
in
the
foreground
silent
unvisited
its
clear
waters
unpolluted
by
the
dregs
of
commerce
or
the
drainage
of
a
vast
metropolis
even
the
caw
caw
of
the
ravens
flying
off
from
the
tops
of
the
pine
stumps
send
a
novel
and
delicious
feeling
of
freedom
through
the
breast
of
the
city
traveller
who
has
put
care
and
work
behind
him
for
a
season
nor
is
this
feeling
altogether
evanescent
even
now
as
winter
approaches
and
the
north
winds
from
the
same
hills
come
sweeping
down
over
the
great
city
sending
us
chattering
and
freezing
to
our
cosey
firesides
the
glory
of
the
july
foliage
moves
our
memory
like
a
dream
of
youth
yet
after
all
it
may
be
doubted
whether
the
charm
of
country
scenes
is
not
due
in
great
part
to
their
novelty
and
the
feeling
that
we
are
not
bound
to
them
longer
than
we
please
of
all
that
has
been
written
in
praise
of
country
life
how
much
is
the
work
of
the
city
resident
how
little
comparatively
speaking
springs
from
the
country
itself
there
drudgery
too
often
takes
the
place
of
sentiment
it
is
the
epicurean
poet
horace
satiated
with
the
noise
of
the
forum
and
the
gossip
of
the
baths
who
sings
sweetest
of
rural
contentment
of
the
herds
the
fruits
of
autumn
and
the
murmuring
over
stony
but
when
he
gives
play
to
his
satiric
vein
none
pictures
more
truthfully
than
the
venusian
the
grumbling
of
the
husbandman
who
the
heavy
clay
with
the
hard
embowered
in
some
shady
arbor
on
the
windings
of
the
digentia
through
his
sabine
farm
or
doing
a
little
amateur
farming
to
the
amusement
as
he
confesses
of
his
blunt
country
neighbors
who
laughed
at
the
dandy
poet
with
a
hoe
in
his
hand
it
was
easy
for
horace
to
chant
the
smooth
and
sunny
side
of
country
life
but
the
eight
laborers
on
his
estate
chained
literally
to
the
soil
as
many
a
new
england
farmer
morally
is
by
the
burden
of
debt
or
family
no
doubt
saw
things
differently
and
the
bailiff
of
his
woodlands
we
know
to
have
despised
those
and
inhospitable
wilds
and
to
have
longed
for
the
streets
and
shows
of
rome
it
is
amazing
upon
what
inattentive
ears
the
music
of
our
wild
birds
falls
in
a
secluded
often
it
seems
absolutely
unheard
while
the
clatter
of
the
long
street
of
the
country
town
that
the
farmer
visits
once
a
month
is
for
ever
in
his
mind
but
we
delay
too
long
at
the
way
station
at
l
let
us
onwards
the
carrier
of
the
united
states
mail
who
is
at
the
same
time
the
jehu
of
the
passenger
stage
slings
our
up
behind
with
an
energy
to
be
envied
by
a
veteran
at
some
of
our
big
depots
straps
it
down
and
jumps
upon
the
box
we
mount
more
slowly
beside
him
disdaining
to
be
shut
up
in
the
close
interior
and
intent
upon
looking
at
the
country
we
pass
through
this
lovely
morning
the
two
stout
grays
breast
the
hill
leading
to
l
centre
eight
miles
distant
the
surface
of
the
country
is
hilly
and
broken
as
we
approach
l
mountainous
mounting
the
crest
of
the
first
steep
hill
a
beautiful
natural
panorama
spreads
out
before
us
long
narrow
intersecting
lines
of
timber
like
giant
hedges
dividing
the
hill
farms
from
each
other
a
rolling
country
spreads
toward
the
east
bounded
on
the
horizon
by
a
low
range
of
mountains
wooded
to
the
summit
and
with
a
white
steeple
flashing
out
here
and
there
among
the
trees
at
their
base
the
effects
of
light
and
shade
caused
by
the
clouds
on
a
brilliant
day
on
one
of
those
white
steeples
standing
out
solitarily
against
the
side
of
a
mountain
eight
or
ten
miles
distant
are
peculiar
sometimes
it
becomes
invisible
as
the
circle
of
the
shadow
is
projected
upon
that
area
of
the
mountain
which
includes
it
then
as
the
dark
veil
moves
slowly
with
a
sliding
motion
up
the
side
and
over
the
crest
of
the
mountain
the
white
spire
flashes
out
from
the
obscure
background
of
the
forest
with
a
sudden
brilliancy
on
this
side
patches
of
blue
water
among
the
trees
in
the
hollows
revealed
the
presence
of
numerous
ponds
as
the
small
lakes
and
some
of
the
large
ones
are
universally
called
in
new
england
to
the
northwest
what
seemed
to
be
a
level
plain
from
the
height
over
which
we
rode
but
which
was
in
reality
broken
and
undulating
ground
stretched
beneath
us
for
ten
or
twelve
miles
to
the
base
of
mt
monadnock
the
mountain
grand
massive
and
still
veiled
by
a
thin
mist
rose
boldly
from
the
low
country
at
its
foot
to
a
height
of
nearly
four
thousand
feet
a
ride
of
an
hour
and
a
half
brought
us
to
the
top
of
the
hill
on
the
side
of
which
stands
l
a
dozen
scattered
houses
flank
the
broad
village
green
and
a
congregational
with
white
belfry
tower
and
green
blinds
stands
down
the
incline
the
and
country
store
combined
is
at
the
as
you
drive
down
the
hill
and
some
ancient
elms
on
the
green
seem
to
nod
at
the
stranger
with
a
friendly
air
as
he
enters
the
village
said
i
to
myself
rural
quiet
and
simplicity
farewell
for
many
slumberous
weeks
the
busy
haunts
of
l
is
quite
out
of
the
beaten
track
of
summer
travel
and
had
been
recommended
me
by
a
friend
who
had
spent
some
seasons
there
on
the
ground
of
economy
charming
scenery
good
fishing
and
repose
nor
did
i
find
any
reason
to
regret
having
listened
to
him
a
country
tavern
offers
entertainment
to
man
and
beast
and
is
resorted
to
by
the
drummers
and
sample
men
who
invade
l
as
elsewhere
with
their
goods
but
i
was
not
forced
to
be
dependent
on
it
as
a
letter
from
my
friend
opened
to
me
the
hospitable
doors
of
the
comfortable
where
he
had
boarded
two
years
before
here
let
it
be
said
at
the
outset
that
whatever
the
other
drawbacks
of
village
life
in
new
hampshire
there
is
among
the
farming
class
a
natural
courtesy
and
among
the
women
even
an
inherited
refinement
of
manner
especially
in
their
treatment
of
strangers
which
speaks
well
for
the
native
stock
prejudices
there
are
among
both
men
and
women
as
we
shall
see
and
opinions
in
plenty
but
even
these
are
concealed
where
to
manifest
them
might
give
offence
the
family
in
which
i
was
domiciled
consisted
of
allen
and
his
wife
their
married
daughter
who
together
with
her
husband
resided
with
them
an
unmarried
daughter
and
a
pretty
little
girl
the
grandchild
allen
kept
a
country
store
for
l
boasted
of
two
and
traded
also
in
cattle
with
canada
making
a
journey
sometimes
as
far
as
montreal
in
the
spring
to
buy
stock
which
he
fattened
on
his
pastures
through
the
summer
and
autumn
and
sold
in
the
early
part
of
the
winter
these
various
ventures
which
were
on
the
whole
successful
as
the
command
of
a
little
ready
money
enabled
him
to
take
his
time
and
buy
and
sell
to
advantage
had
made
him
more
than
most
of
his
neighbors
he
was
one
of
the
selectmen
of
l
his
a
large
white
edifice
with
a
facing
the
village
street
a
piazza
on
the
sunny
side
and
two
beautiful

dividing

yard
from

one
of
the
handsomest
in

allen
was
one
of
those
energetic
housewives
whose
sound
sense
and
domestic
capacity
had
evidently
contributed
not
a
little
to
her
present
prosperity
they
were
a
sturdy
couple
intelligent
honest
and
knowing
what
was
due
to
themselves
and
others
now
going
down
the
hill
together
with
mutual
dependence
and
confidence
in
each
other
i
consider
them
a
good
example
of
the
best
type
of
the
new
hampshire
farming
class
the
married
daughter
did
not
compare
favorably
with
the
mother
one
could
not
say
of
her
in
any
sense
matre
pulchra
filia
pulchrior
for
as
to
the
question
of
female
beauty
i
will
not
say
as
far
as
my
observations
extend
that
the
new
hampshire
or
indeed
the
new
england
women
generally
outside
the
radius
of
boston
and
some
of
the
large
towns
are
very
generously
endowed
by
nature
with
that
gracious
but
dangerous
gift
the
lines
of
the
face
are
too
strongly
marked
they
are
sallow
the
form
angular
or
where
the
figure
is
fuller
it
is
apt
to
be
as
redundant
as
the
old
flemish
painters
make
the
women
at
a
village
fair
but
this
absence
of
feminine
beauty
is
not
universal
i
have
seen
a
young
mother
with
her
babe
in
her
lap
a
visitor
sitting
in
parlor
who
made
a
picture
of
beautiful
maternity
as
dignified
and
simple
as
murillo
ever
painted
as
for
that
more
lasting
moral
beauty
which
where
it
is
feminine
puts
on
its
most
delightful
and
engaging
charm
harley
the
married
daughter
was
too
much
engaged
with
her
own
little
cares
and
gossip
poor
woman
to
think
much
of
so
intangible
a
possession
brought
up
probably
in
habits
of
more
leisure
and
than
her
mother
who
still
took
all
the
household
work
upon
herself
she
was
a
victim
of
and
of
that
blight
of
too
many
american
homes
only
one
child
to
care
for
her
health
was
delicate
and
uncertain
and
she
bade
fair
to
sink
eventually
into
that
class
of
invalid
wives
which
forms
such
an
unhappily
large
percentage
of
american
women
how
often
have
i
heard
her
complain
of
the
dreadful
dulness
of
the
day
i
asked
will
you
do
in
the
winter
if
you
find
the
summer
so
unbearable
her
answer
was
that
they
generally
enjoyed
themselves
enough
in
the
to
be
able
to
get
through
the
winter
i
know
whether
this
was
a
covert
thrust
at
my
lack
of
entertaining
power
but
i
laughed
at
the
stroke
of
satire
at
my
expense
innocent
or
intended
that
long
dreary
new
hampshire
winter
it
demanded
indeed
a
stout
heart
to
face
it
in
one
of
those
isolated
villages
harley
had
given
up
her
music
when
she
married
the
piano
stood
idle
in
the
best
room
she
read
nothing
unless
looking
at
the
in
a
magazine
be
considered
reading
a
picnic
a
shopping
in
the
nearest
country
town
were
white
days
in
her
calendar
is
such
a
picture
of
life
cheerless
yet
too
many
women
are
forced
to
endure
it
elsewhere
happy
they
if
the
abounding
resources
of
the
faith
and
its
literature
come
to
their
aid
harley
was
a
kind
woman
withal
if
her
attention
were
drawn
for
a
moment
from
herself
and
an
affectionate
and
anxious
wife
this
and
her
love
for
her
child
fretful
and
as
the
latter
sentiment
was
apt
to
be
were
her
redeeming
qualities
placed
in
a
large
city
with
means
equal
in
proportion
to
those
within
her
reach
in
l
she
would
have
made
a
more
agreeable
woman
and
would
have
been
tenfold
happier
herself
the
influence
of
life
where
a
religious
vocation
does
not
exalt
and
sanctify
it
is
more
unfavorable
in
its
effects
upon
women
than
upon
men
the
latter
commonly
have
work
to
do
which
keeps
their
faculties
from
rusting
nature
is
essentially
social
harley
assisted
his
in
the
store
a
tall
handsome
young
man
with
a
city
air
who
at
that
season
sat
in
the
store
the
whole
afternoon
with
perhaps
one
customer
such
a
life
for
youth
with
its
superabundant
energies
ready
to
pour
like
a
torrent
into
any
channel
is
stagnation
the
highest
of
natural
powers
rust
and
decay
but
natural
forces
have
their
sway
in
the
great
majority
of
such
cases
and
force
an
outlet
for
themselves
the
youth
of
these
villages
leave
their
homes
for
the
great
cities
or
take
horace
advice
and
life
is
hard
and
it
is
monotonous
which
adds
a
new
slavery
to
hardship
the
exodus
is
constant
l
has
less
population
and
fewer
inhabited
houses
now
than
it
had
forty
years
ago
the
same
is
true
of
other
villages
a
striking
fact
in
a
comparatively
new
country
one
rambles
along
some
overgrown
with
grass
and
presently
comes
upon
a
deserted
and
ruined
house
and
barn

perhaps
nothing
more
than

heap
of
bricks

asks
about
the
people
and
is
told
that
they
have
the
answer
is
vague
and
uncertain
as
their
fate
i
spoke
to
an
old
man
of
seated
in
the
shade
on
the
long
bench
before
the
country
store
where
he
could
hear
the
news
in
the
morning
he
remembered
with
distinctness
the
events
of
the
war
of
he
spoke
with
regret
of
the
flourishing
times
of
his
youth
in
l
and
its
dulness
this
roving
disposition
of
the
american
youth
is
the
result
of
immense
and
has
been
providential
in
building
up
new
states
and
subduing
the
virgin
wilderness
the
manufacturing
cities
of
new
hampshire
also
gain
yearly
at
the
expense
of
the
small
villages
the
township
or
town
as
it
is
most
commonly
called
embraces
three
or
four
of
such
villages
and
is
subject
to
the
same
reciprocal
movement
comparatively
few
new
farms
have
been
broken
in
during
the
last
twenty
or
thirty
years
and
too
rarely
it
happens
on
the
old
farms
that
fresh
ground
is
taken
in
from
the
pasture
for
cultivation
the
son
tills
what
his
father
or
grandfather
cleared
the
first
few
days
in
l
i
spent
rambling
about
the
pastures
some
of
them
literally
red
with
the
raspberry
which
though
it
has
not
the
delicacy
or
fragrance
of
the
wild
strawberry
is
not
to
be
disdained
by
the
city
palate
or
climbing
to
the
tops
of
the
highest
neighboring
hills
what
a
sense
of
elastic
joy
and
freedom
to
me
who
had
not
spent
a
summer
in
the
country
for
three
years
to
lie
stretched
at
full
length
on
the
top
of
a
hill
and
let
the
eye
wander
over
the
valley
beneath
with
its
intervening
woods
and
ponds
till
it
rested
upon
the
distant
mountains
the
chasing
each
other
over
their
sides
and
summits
if
this
were
not
in
truth
an
arcadia
to
those
who
lived
and
died
there
and
were
buried
in
the
churchyard
among
the
elms
if
to
them
life
brought
its
cares
its
jealousies
and
sorrows
to
the
stranger
who
sought
nothing
more
than
to
enjoy
its
natural
beauties
it
renewed
all
the
associations
of
rural
happiness
and
simplicity
not
that
one
might
hope
to
see
a
corydon
and
phillis
issue
from
the
new
hampshire
woods
for
there
is
a
sternness
among
those
northern
scenes
even
in
the
brightest
bloom
of
summer
foreign
to
the
poetry
of
the
south
but
that
in
its
dark
pine
groves
and
on
its
windy
hills
fancy
might
picture
an
eclogue
or
a
romance
not
less
sweet
and
tender
because
more
real
l
is
on
the
height
of
land
between
the
valleys
of
the
connecticut
and
merrimac
between
twenty
and
thirty
miles
distant
from
each
it
is
from
one
thousand
to
one
thousand
three
hundred
feet
above
the
sea
level
it
is
said
of
the
rain
that
falls
on
the
roof
of
the
village
church
that
part
of
it
eventually
runs
into
the
connecticut
part
into
the
merrimac
so
evenly
does
its
divide
the
of
those
rivers
but
as
the
same
story
is
told
of
other
churches
in
the
central
belt
of
cheshire
county
it
may
be
regarded
rather
in
the
light
of
a
rhetorical
illustration
than
as
a
fact
of
physical
geography
the
scenery
is
not
of
the
grand
or
sublime
order
to
be
seen
further
north
among
the
white
mountains
except
where
mt
monadnock
raises
its
dark
and
solemn
front
above
the
surrounding
landscape
but
it
is
beautiful
and
picturesque
its
greatest
charm
is
its
variety
in
the
morning
when
the
sun
was
well
towards
the
zenith
for
the
fresh
air
of
those
hills
made
the
day
at
all
hours
delightful
i
would
stroll
out
over
the
pastures
to
a
hill
a
quarter
of
a
mile
distant
from
the
there
would
i
seat
myself
protected
from
the
ardent
rays
under
a
young
maple
bush
the
elastic
branches
of
which
with
the
sloping
ground
thick
with
ferns
made
a
natural
the
valley
is
below
me
the
farms
stretch
along
the
nearer
hills
and
in
the
further
distance
the
mountains
define
the
skyline
i
bend
down
a
branch
of
the
maple
and
before
me
is
the
upper
half
of
mt
monadnock
a
thin
gray
mist
still
enveloping
it
the
base
of
the
mountain
is
hidden
by
an
intervening
hill
leaving
this
pasture
and
walking
a
few
hundred
rods
further
on
i
enter
a
field
where
the
hay
has
just
been
cut
and
which
is
now
as
smooth
as
a
croquet
lawn
but
not
so
level
for
it
is
the
crest
of
one
of
the
highest
hills
here
a
new
scene
awaits
me
to
the
north
and
west
the
hill
has
the
shape
almost
of
a
perfect
dome
stretched
on
the
top
i
can
not
see
the
declivities
of
the
sides
but
only
the
tops
of
the
trees
at
some
distance
one
has
the
sensation
of
being
on
the
roof
of
a
high
building
with
a
deep
drop
between
him
and
the
surrounding
country
the
view
is
superb
the
whole
mass
of
mt
monadnock
from
its
base
to
the
highest
elevation
rises
from
the
valley
ten
miles
distant
at
its
foot
is
the
village
of
west
jaffrey
a
fashionable
watering
place
the
white
spire
of
the
church
is
conspicuous
among
the
trees
further
south
is
gap
mountain
and
attleborough
mountain
and
sweeping
round
to
the
east
the
view
stretches
along
the
new
ipswich
mountains
to
watatick
hill
the
circuit
extends
about
twenty
or
thirty
miles
making
a
picture
of
great
natural
beauty
the
english
hay
as
the
timothy
and
red
clover
are
generally
called
was
still
standing
in
many
of
the
fields
but
here
and
there
the
whirr
of
the
could
be
heard
and
the
eye
following
the
direction
of
the
sound
could
discern
the
mower
in
his
driving
his
pair
of
horses
in
the
distant
field
the
of
the
lowlands
was
still
in
most
places
untouched
on
the
sides
of
the
hills
the
scattered
fields
of
wheat
barley
and
oats
still
green
made
darker
patches
of
verdure
on
the
yellowish
but
the
view
i
most
preferred
was
from
a
hill
a
little
to
the
south
of
the
village
near
some
deserted
buildings
here
the
scene
was
wilder
and
more
extensive
to
the
west
mt
monadnock
could
be
seen
through
a
gorge
between
two
hills
to
the
east
was
a
wild
and
broken
country
while
to
the
south
the
woods
seemed
to
extend
as
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
and
over
the
furthest
range
of
hills
the
great
dome
of
mt
wachusett
in
massachusetts
nearly
thirty
miles
distant
was
plainly
seen
gray
and
massive
with
the
naked
eye
it
was
only
when
one
turned
to
mt
monadnock
ten
miles
distant
and
observed
how
plainly
he
could
distinguish
the
different
colors
of
the
mountain
the
dark
woods
the
brown
bare
surfaces
and
the
rocks
that
looking
at
mt
wachusett
and
noting
its
uniform
pale
gray
outline
he
was
able
to
estimate
the
real
distance
of
the
latter
so
comparatively
close
at
hand
did
it
appear
seated
at
ease
on
the
smooth
turf
on
the
summit
of
this
hill
and
looking
at
this
wide
and
beautiful
prospect
one
might
repeat
to
himself
lines
it
was
when
woods
were
green
and
winds
were
soft
and
low
to
lie
amid
some
sylvan
scene
where
the
long
drooping
boughs
between
shadows
dark
and
sunlight
sheen
alternate
come
and
go
substituting
only
for
the
irregular
ranges
of
hills
but
descriptions
of
natural
scenery
if
long
continued
are
wearisome
even
a
ruskin
is
read
best
in
snatches
the
mind
otherwise
becomes
clogged
with
images
let
us
return
therefore
to
animated
life
as
sunday
approached
i
made
inquiries
about
the
nearest
catholic
church
i
found
it
was
at
w
eight
or
nine
miles
distant
i
had
no
means
of
getting
there
the
first
sunday
i
retired
to
my
room
and
read
some
chapters
of
that
sublime
and
affecting
work
the
of
the
gift
of
a
good
and
beloved
mother
a
catholic
is
still
almost
a
being
from
another
moral
world
in
some
of
the
isolated
new
hampshire
villages
nowhere
are
the
traditions
of
puritanism
more
zealously
or
rigidly
maintained
these
good
folk
seem
hardly
yet
to
have
emerged
from
a
fog
of
wild
amazement
that
priests
and
their
followers
should
be
tolerated
by
the
selectmen
not
that
any
overt
or
offensive
change
of
manner
follows
the
announcement
that
one
is
a
catholic
as
i
have
elsewhere
said
there
is
a
natural
or
inherited
vein
of
good
manners
among
the
people
that
forbids
it
but
a
momentary
silence
reveals
to
the
speaker
that
he
has
stated
something
strange
and
unlooked
for
there
is
an
unmistakable
tone
of
intolerance
manifest
however
in
any
allusion
to
the
poorer
class
of
irish
and
french
that
congregate
in
the
larger
towns
and
are
sometimes
found
in
the
villages
in
a
factory
or
cutting
wood
or
or
doing
an
odd
job
of
haymaking
they
are
looked
upon
with
dislike
and
distrust
mixed
with
a
feeling
of
contempt
curious
it
is
that
the
new
englander
with
his
mind
saturated
with
hereditary
theories
of
personal
liberty
equality
and
fraternity
should
yet
evince
a
more
unconquerable
aversion
to
the
foreign
element
which
has
contributed
so
largely
to
the
greatness
of
the
country
than
is
shown
in
european
countries
to
men
of
a
different
race
unless
war
has
temporarily
embittered
national
feeling
yet
the
explanation
is
not
hard
to
find
this
descendant
of
the
puritan
chained
to
the
rocky
and
ungrateful
soil
his
forefathers
won
from
the
indians
and
the
wilderness
sees
with
sullen
indignation
and
jealousy
the
same
rights
and
privileges
which
he
enjoys
under
our
free
institutions
extended
so
largely
to
those
of
a
different
nationality
and
religion
in
revenge
he
draws
himself
more
jealously
into
his
shell
nor
is
this
feeling
confined
to
the
rich
and
refined
it
penetrates
the
mass
of
the
new
england
population
to
speak
of
lighter
things
society
in
l
is
eminently
aristocratic
better
perhaps
it
would
be
to
say
that
the
lines
of
society
are
very
strongly
marked
and
that
the
aristocratic
element
is
essentially
conservative
cortland
the
wife
of
the

capitalist
who

there
three
months
in

condescending

metropolitan
tone
to

cortland

be
hard

uncertain
his

house
a
large
handsome

cortland
occupies
without
dispute
the
highest
ground

it

an
imperial
elevation

the
manner
of

saying
attributed
to

a
call
on

the
event
of
a
week
and
a
return
call
from

is
a
matter
not
to
be
lightly
treated

seen

good

grand

indifference

of
the
congregational
pastor
and
parsons
the
wife
of
parsons
who
owns
a
small
near
l
these
two
ladies
maintain
a
strict
alliance
offensive
and
defensive
with
cortland
during
the
summer
then
come
the
middle
classes
comprising
allen
and
harley
the
young
wife
a
stranger
and
somewhat
snubbed
by
the
autochthonous
and
the
wives
finally
we
have
the
the
tail
of
l
society
or
to
speak
more
correctly
those
whom
society
does
not
recognize
some
wives
whose
husbands
were
too
much
in
debt
to
allow
them
to
keep
up
appearances
one
or
two
hapless
women
who
sold
milk
in
a
wagon
to
the
neighboring
towns
and
drove
the
wagon
themselves
and
the
village
washerwoman
who
went
around
doing
i
think
i
have
exhausted
the
classification
of
the
social
strata
of
l
i
observed
that
the
men
eschewed
as
much
as
possible
the
aristocratic
distinctions
made
by
their
wives
and
were
apt
to
resent
by
silence
or
the
assumption
of
an
unwonted
bluntness
the
empty
airs
and
loud
voice
with
which
some
vulgar
rich
man
from
a
neighboring
large
town
would
sometimes
stride
through
the
village
wanderers
and
waifs
destined
apparently
to
be
at
some
time
drawn
into
the
great
caldron
of
city
life
perhaps
to
their
own
destruction
were
not
wanting
in
l
i
have
said
that
the
women
were
not
remarkable
for
beauty
but
there
was
one
exception
a
girl
belonging
to
one
of
the
most
destitute
families
in
the
village
by
one
of
those
whims
of
nature
which
are
not
uncommon
was
gifted
with
a
face
and
figure
to
attract
even
an
unobservant
eye
and
which
seemed
out
of
place
in
that
quiet
and
homely
neighborhood
the
mother
a
poor
struggling
woman
with
a
family
of
all
ages
managed
to
live
somehow
by
the
work
and
occasional
assistance
given
her
by
the
families
the
father
was
living
but
spent
most
of
his
time
in
the
county
jail
for
drunkenness
the
daughter
of
whom
i
speak
was
about
nineteen
or
twenty
years
of
age
tall
of
fair
complexion
with
a
naturally
elegant
carriage
and
a
proud
and
almost
defiant
air
as
if
she
resented
the
caprice
of
fortune
which
had
placed
her
in
that
lowly
station
she
had
the
art
of
dressing
well
with
limited
means
which
some
women
possess
to
the
envy
of
others
on
sundays
and
at
picnics
she
outshone
the
more
daughters
of
the
farmers
she
had
been
and
perhaps
still
is
the
maid
at
the
village
inn
it
may
be
imagined
that
gossip
was
not
idle
about
this
poor
girl
thus
singularly
placed
and
dangerously
gifted
dreadful
quarrels
had
taken
place
between
the
father
and
mother
about
the
staying
at
the
hotel
the
drunken
father
with
a
true
sense
of
what
was
becoming
insisting
that
she
should
leave
the
mother
as
strenuously
maintaining
that
she
should
remain
the
beauty
of
the
girl
herself
was
not
of
that
domestic
type
i
have
elsewhere
noticed
in
the
mother
and
her
babe
i
saw
in
parlor
but
of
that
showy
restless
naturally
haughty
stamp
which
presaged
storm
perhaps
disaster
it
is
this
class
misfortune
follows
and
the
great
cities
sweep
into
their
net
poverty
often
makes
vice
of
that
which
under
happier
fortunes
might
have
been
attractive
virtue
may
this
rustic
beauty
find
a
happier
if
more
homely
destiny
as
the
wife
of
some
honest
farmer
in
l
the
summer
passed
week
after
week
i
fished
i
walked
i
rode
i
read
i
loitered
the
barley
ripened
on
the
hill
behind
the
and
a
golden
tint
began
to
spread
over
the
distant
fields
the
apples
grew
large
and
ruddy
on
one
side
where
the
sun
struck
the
laden
branch
in
the
orchard
the
tassels
of
the
corn
showed
purple
august
blazed
the
doves
flew
thirstily
to
the
large
blue
pump
and
perched
on
the
edges
of
the
after
the
farmer
watered
his
horse
at
the
bees
hummed
three
at
a
time
in
the
big
yellow
cups
of
the
have
you
ever
observed
of
that
homely
vegetable
how
ingeniously
and
dexterously
it
fastens
its
daring
and
aggressive
vines
to
the
ground
as
it
shoots
out
over
the
grass
stoop
down
among
the
or
rowen
as
it
is
called
in
new
hampshire
and
you
will
see
that
at
the
inosculation
of
each
successive
joint
of
the
vine
where
it
throws
out
its
tendrils
and
blossoms
it
also
thrusts
forth
slender
white
curling
ligaments
that
twist
each
of
them
tightly
around
a
tiny
tuft
of
the
short
grass
thus
it
moors
itself
as
if
by
so
many
delicate
living
cables
to
the
bosom
of
the
earth
i
might
if
space
allowed
tell
of
my
fishing
ventures
and
how
one
glorious
morning
we
rode
out
of
l
in
a
big
yellow
wagon
with
three
horses
a
party
of
seven
of
us
ladies
and
gentlemen
from
the
village
to
make
the
ascent
of
mt
monadnock
this
is
the
lion
of
all
the
country
round
parties
are
made
up
every
week
to
climb
its
rugged
summit
over
the
hills
and
rolling
ground
we
gaily
rattled
through
the
sandy
country
roads
where
the
branches
of
the
trees
met
overhead
and
made
dim
aisles
of
verdure
we
smoothly
sped
and
then
what
panting
laughing
climbing
shrill
screaming
as
we
toiled
up
the
winding
path
from
the
house
to
the
top
of
the
mountain
what
a
magnificent
boundless
view
repaid
us
the
day
was
clear
to
the
north
mt
kearsarge
and
rolling
ranges
of
mountains
to
the
southeast
a
diversified
surface
of
country
spreading
onwards
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
towards
the
unseen
ocean
to
the
south
mt
wachusett
below
us
woods
valleys
and
lakes
a
feeling
of
awe
creeps
over
one
in
these
mountain
solitudes
as
to
the
fishing
i
will
confess
that
to
me
who
had
thrown
a
fly
over
more
than
one
canadian
river
and
had
killed
my
salmon
on
the
nipisiquit
loafing
with
a
pole
in
a
boat
over
a
pond
for
a
pickerel
was
not
tremendously
exciting
sport
but
what
mattered
it
the
mornings
were
soft
and
wooing
the
woods
were
full
of
mysterious
shadows
the
water
was
limpid
as
if
diana
and
her
nymphs
bathed
there
in
the
spectral
moonlight
life
passed
smoothly
and
agreeably
i
sought
no
more
the
blackberries
began
to
ripen
first
one
by
one
and
then
in
sable
clusters
in
the
pastures
the
days
were
growing
shorter
the
twilight
sank
more
quickly
into
night
september
approached
and
i
began
to
look
for
the
appearance
of
my
friend
jones
i
had
seen
miss
cortland
two
or
three
times
coming
from
or
going
to
the
on
sunday
mornings
when
all
the
beauty
and
fashion
of
l
for
miles
around
rode
up
in
buggies
carryalls
or
open
wagons
but
i
had
never
met
her
to
be
introduced
to
her
a
little
imperial
beauty
with
a
fresh
and
rosy
color
and
a
mouth
shaped
like
bow
that
needed
only
to
smile
to
conquer
on
a
bright
september
morning
when
the
surrounding
atmosphere
was
clear
as
a
bell
but
a
thin
haze
still
clung
about
mt
monadnock
and
the
mountains
jones
rode
over
on
the
from
the
railroad
station
and
joined
me
at
l
he
asked
eagerly
about
miss
cortland
was
she
in
the
village
yes
had
i
met
her
no
but
i
had
seen
her
two
or
three
times
what
did
i
think
of
her
well
i
thought
her
pretty
enough
to
excuse
a
little
wildness
of
imagination
on
his
part
he
would
be
a
lucky
fellow
if
he
got
her
and
some
of
her
money
or
a
position
in
his
business
did
i
think
he
would
give
up
his
art
so
easily
dear
jones
i
replied
want
to
appear
or
to
dash
your
enthusiasm
for
your
art
in
the
least
but
to
speak
candidly
i
should
not
be
surprised
if
you
did
some
day
under
sufficient
temptation
the
prospect
of
marrying
miss
cortland
for
jones
declared
his
intention
of
calling
on
miss
cortland
that
very
day
he
had
a
full
of
studies
spirited
but
many
of
them
mere
hints
he
came
back
before
dinner
full
of
life
and
proposing
a
score
of
schemes
for
he
made
a
sort
of
small
whirlwind
in
my
quiet
life
cortland
had
received
him
civilly
but
he
thought
a
little
coolly
but
he
had
seen
agnes
and
had
spoken
a
few
words
to
her
that
might
mean
much
or
little
as
they
were
taken
and
he
was
happy
rather
boisterously
happy
perhaps
as
a
young
fellow
will
be
at
such
times
full
of
jokes
and
refusing
to
see
a
cloud
on
his
horizon
jones
fell
easily
into
our
ways
though
he
was
apt
to
steal
off
in
the
mornings
to
play
croquet
on
the
lawn
with
miss
cortland
and
miss
parsons
and
any
other
friend
they
could
get
to
join
them
one
afternoon
when
the
sun
was
getting
low
and
a
southerly
wind
blowing
we
started
to
try
for
some
fish
at
a
pond
about
half
an
walk
from
the
house
as
we
turned
off
the
highway
into
a
covered
with
grass
that
led
to
the
pond
i
saw
miss
cortland
standing
on
the
rising
ground
some
distance
before
us
she
was
looking
from
us
towards
the
sinking
sun
now
veiled
in
clouds
her
dog
a
large
powerful
animal
a
cross
between
a
newfoundland
and
mount
bernard
was
crouched
at
her
feet
some
vague
thoughts
about
una
and
her
lion
flitted
through
my
mind
but
i
was
more
struck
by
the
way
the
light
touched
her
figure
standing
out
motionless
against
the
gray
sky
it
reminded
me
very
much
of
the
general
effect
of
a
painting
by
a
foreign
artist
kammerer
i
think
it
was
that
i
saw
at
the
exhibition
of
the
boston
art
club
last
year
it
was
the
picture
of
a
girl
standing
on
a
pier
on
the
french
coast
looking
out
to
sea
her
golden
hair
was
slightly
stirred
by
the
breeze
her
lips
a
little
parted
and
there
was
a
look
in
her
eyes
as
if
she
may
have
expected
a
lover
to
be
coming
over
the
sea
in
one
of
the
yachts
that
lined
the
horizon
the
dress
of
the
girl
and
the
of
the
pier
were
both
white
it
was
a
good
example
of
the
striking
effects
produced
by
the
free
use
of
a
great
deal
of
almost
staring
white
which
is
a
favorite
device
of
the
latest
school
of
french
art
as
we
advanced
the
dog
growled
and
rose
but
recognizing
jones
wagged
his
tail
inoffensively
as
we
drew
nearer
miss
cortland
turned
towards
us
i
introduce
you
said
jones
i
said
go
on
to
the
pond
see
you
jones
advanced
hat
in
hand
happy
fortune
he
said
addressing
her
led
me
to
meet
the
goddess
of
these
woods
then
altering
his
tone
he
added
in
a
bantering
way
see
you
have
been
poaching
on
our
preserves
miss
cortland
but
i
do
wonder
at
your
taste
fishing
for
eels
pointing
to
a
small
basket
on
her
arm
from
which
hung
some
of
the
long
stems
of
the
this
he
said
to
vex
her
knowing
her
horror
of
those
creatures
she
exclaimed
indignantly
with
a
tone
and
gesture
of
aversion
at
the
thought
are
that
is
very
well
to
say
replied
jones
you
have
the
lid
of
the
basket
down
to
hide
them
but
i
insist
upon
their
being
eels
unless
you
show
them
to
by
this
time
i
was
out
of
hearing
i
left
them
together
and
kept
on
down
the
road
to
the
pond
that
night
jones
came
into
my
room
with
a
quieter
manner
than
usual
he
was
evidently
very
happy
but
his
happiness
had
a
sobering
effect
upon
him
he
told
me
that
he
had
made
a
plain
avowal
of
his
feelings
to
agnes
cortland
as
they
walked
home
together
and
that
he
had
won
from
her
the
confession
that
she
loved
him
and
had
not
been
indifferent
to
him
before
he
left
for
europe
i
wished
him
joy
of
his
though
i
could
foresee
plainly
enough
that
his
difficulties
had
only
begun
for
a
little
time
these
two
innocent
young
souls
for
jones
i
knew
to
be
singularly
unsullied
by
the
world
for
a
man
of
his
age
would
enjoy
their
paradise
undisturbed
together
then
would
come
maternal
explanations
and
the
authority
would
be
invoked
a
solemn
promise
would
be
exacted
from
her
to
see
him
no
more
miss
cortland
was
much
attached
to
her
parents
who
would
be
sincerely
anxious
for
her
welfare
she
would
not
make
much
resistance
some
day
there
would
come
a
storm
of
tears
and
poor
letters
and
the
ring
he
gave
her
would
be
returned
to
him
by
a
faithful
messenger
and
a
little
note
blotted
with
tears
asking
him
to
forgive
her
and
praying
for
his
happiness
this
must
be
the
end
a
year
or
two
of
separation
and
a
summer
and
winter
in
europe
with
her
parents
would
leave
nothing
more
than
a
little
sad
memory
of
her
brief
new
hampshire
romance
and
in
five
years
she
would
be
married
to
some
foreigner
of
distinction
or
successful
man
of
business
and
would
be
a
happy
wife
and
mother
as
for
poor
jones
he
would
probably
be
heard
of
at
rare
intervals
for
a
year
or
two
as
a
trader
on
the
pacific
coast
or
prospecting
a
claim
in
nevada
but
men
like
him
vigorous
powerful
well
equipped
in
body
and
temper
for
the
struggle
with
the
world
are
not
kept
down
long
by
such
disappointments
the
storm
is
fierce
and
leaves
its
scars
after
it
but
the
man
rises
above
it
and
is
more
closely
knit
thereafter
jones
will
make
his
mark
in
the
world
of
business
if
not
of
art
no
unwelcome
prophecies
of
mine
however
disturbed
his
happiness
for
those
few
days
i
let
events
take
their
course
why
should
i
interrupt
his
dream
by
anticipations
of
woe
which
would
have
been
resented
as
a
reflection
upon
the
constancy
of
his
idol
i
know
that
they
met
frequently
for
the
following
three
or
four
days
then
came
the
packing
up
for
departure
my
long
holiday
was
over
on
a
foggy
morning
in
september
we
steamed
up
the
sound
on
a
fall
river
boat
through
hell
gate
the
stately
boat
sped
on
her
way
past
island
and
across
the
bows
of
the
brooklyn
crowded
with
passengers
for
the
city
in
the
early
morning
around
the
battery
we
swept
into
the
north
river
and
slowly
swung
alongside
of
pier
then
the
hackmen
yelled
at
us
our
coach
stuck
at
the
corner
of
the
street
a
jam
followed
the
drivers
swore
the
policemen
shouted
and
threatened
the
small
boys
grinned
and
dodged
between
the
horses
and
a
ward
politician
with
a
ruby
nose
looked
on
complacently
from
the
steps
of
a
corner
room
in
one
word
we
were
in
new
york
and
our
village
life
in
hampshire
was
a
thing
of
the
past
the
palatine
prelates
of
rome
whatever
is
connected
with
our
holy
father
must
have
an
interest
for
catholics
and
at
the
present
time
especially
it
would
seem
desirable
to
know
something
about
the
origin
and
functions
of
those
faithful
prelates
of
whom
this
article
treats
and
with
some
of
whom
american
visitors
to
rome
may
be
likely
to
have
relations
they
are
called
palatine
prelates
because
lodged
in
the
same
palace
as
the
sovereign
and
in
these
days
of
trouble
are
the
nearest
to
his
most
sacred
majesty
in
his
solitude
and
sufferings
they
are
four
in
number
and
belong
to
the
intimate
court
and
confidence
their
names
being
registered
in
the
roman
immediately
after
those
of
the
palatine
cardinals
among
the
members
of
the
pontifical
family
maggiordomo
the
majordomo
called
in
good
latin
the
official
language
of
the
church
domus
is
the
first
of
these
prelates
and
one
of
the
highest
dignitaries
of
the
holy
see
the
chief
of
the
royal
palace
has
had
in
all
countries
immense
influence
and
power
and
in
france
and
scotland
at
least
the
du
and
stewards
succeeded
in
mounting
the
throne
this
officer
who
like
the
other
three
is
always
a
clergyman
is
the
high
steward
of
his
holiness
and
master
of
his
household
remaining
day
and
night
conveniently
near
to
the
person
of
which
he
has
the
special
care
and
for
the
safety
of
which
he
is
responsible
to
the
sacred
college
until
the
present
reign
he
was
supreme
under
the
sovereign
in
the
civil
military
and
ecclesiastical
affairs
of
the
court
having
his
own
tribunal
of
civil
and
criminal
jurisdiction
some
years
ago
however
a
part
of
the
prerogatives
of
this
office
was
transferred
to
the
cardinal
secretary
of
state
but
even
now
the
majordomo
is
at
the
head
of
the
administration
of
the
palace
in
which
the
pope
may
reside
for
the
time
being
and
on
a
vacancy
of
the
see
is
by
a
decree
of
clement
xii
in
governor
of
the
conclave
in
this
latter
capacity
by
a
natural
order
of
things
which
can
not
be
long
delayed
yet
god
grant
it
may
he
will
have
to
act
a
part
during
one
of
the
most
critical
periods
in
the
history
of
christian
rome
he
has
the
privilege
for
life
of
using
the
arms
with
his
own
and
consequently
retains
this
heraldic
distinction
even
after
he
has
been
promoted
to
the
cardinalate
to
which
his
office
surely
leads
sooner
or
later
according
to
a
court
custom
that
began
in
the
middle
of
the
xviith
century
the
origin
of
this
office
is
involved
in
some
doubt
owing
to
its
antiquity
it
must
have
been
that
in
the
palace
given
to
pope
melchiades
by
the
emperor
constantine
some
person
conspicuous
for
piety
and
prudence
was
appointed
to
keep
the
members
of
a
large
and
court
in
mutual
harmony
and
subjection
to
authority
while
relieving
the
pontiff
of
the
immediate
superintendence
of
his
household
and
leaving
him
free
to
give
his
precious
time
to
public
and
more
important
matters
at
all
events
at
a
very
early
period
after
this
there
is
mentioned
among
the
officers
attached
to
the
as
the
old
were
then
called
a
who
was
chosen
from
the
roman
clergy
and
was
often
as
the
more
modern
prelates
have
been
invested
with
the
episcopal
dignity
he
was
answerable
for
the
good
order
and
harmonious
administration
of
the
palace
and
the
extent
of
that
portion
of
it
in
which
he
dwelt
and
had
his
offices
as
well
as
held
his
court
of
jurisdiction
over
the
papal
domestics
must
have
been
large
since
it
was
called
the
and
although
his
successor
fifteen
hundred
years
later
has
not
the
same
ample
powers
that
he
enjoyed
he
is
still
a
personage
so
considerable
that
the
part
of
the
vatican
in
which
he
resides
is
known
officially
as
the
the
earliest
name
not
title
of
such
an
officer
which
has
come
down
to
us
is
that
of
a
certain
priest
ampliatus
who
is
mentioned
in
the
year
as
having
accompanied
pope
vigilius
to
constantinople
for
the
affair
of
the
three
chapters
and
being
detached
from
the
suite
at
sicily
on
their
way
back
with
orders
to
hurry
on
to
rome
where
the
concerns
of
the
lateran
seem
to
have
suffered
by
his
absence
anatolius
a
deacon
held
the
office
under
gregory
the
great
who
was
very
particular
to
have
only
virtuous
and
learned
men
about
him
and
in
benedict
a
bishop
held
it
under
zachary
who
sent
him
on
a
mission
to
luitprand
king
of
the
lombards
this
officer
is
mentioned
for
the
last
time
in
history
as
in
the
year
when
an
archdeacon
benedict
served
under
benedict
ix
after
this
period
those
who
held
the
analogous
position
were
styled
chamberlains
of
the
holy
roman
church
until
when
the
court
being
at
avignon
a
large
share
of
their
duties
and
privileges
was
given
to
a
nobleman
of
high
standing
who
was
called
del
sacro
under
alexander
in
the
holy
father
having
returned
to
rome
mention
is
made
for
the
first
time
in
a
paper
drawn
up
for
the
guidance
of
the
court
of
a
prefect
of
the
apostolic
palace
domus
who
was
the
same
as
the
later
majordomo
the
name
only
having
been
changed
by
urban
viii
in
the
series
of
these
high
prelates
to
the
number
of
belonging
generally
to
the
very
first
nobility
of
italy
and
showing
such
illustrious
names
as

a
neapolitan
who
was
named
to
the
office
by
pius
ii
in
the
month
of
august
maestro
di
camera
this
officer
whose
official
title
in
latin
is
cubiculi
sanctitatis
is
the
second
palatine
prelate
he
is
the
grand
chamberlain
of
his
holiness
carries
out
the
entire
court
ceremonial
and
has
the
supervision
of
all
audiences
as
well
as
admittances
of
whatever
kind
to
the
presence
of
the
pope
how
important
and
confidential
is
this
post
which
he
holds
at
the
door
of
the
papal
chambers
may
best
be
judged
from
the
single
fact
that
no
one
can
approach
the
sovereign
without
his
knowledge
in
all
and
his
consent
in
most
cases
he
has
sometimes
the
episcopal
character
in
truth
was
usually
in
times
past
an
archbishop
but
it
is
now
more
customary
for
him
to
be
simply
in
orders
if
however
he
be
not
already
a
prelate
of
high
rank
he
is
always
immediately
after
his
nomination
to
the
office
made
an
apostolic
prothonotary
with
precedence
over
all
his
brethren
in
that
ancient
and
honorable
college
like
his
immediate
superior
he
has
the
privilege
of
quartering
the
arms
with
his
own
he
is
the
keeper
of
the
ring
and
at
the
death
delivers
it
up
to
the
cardinal
chamberlain
of
the
holy
roman
college
who
gives
him
a
notarial
receipt
for
it
this
celebrated
ring
is
the
official
one
of
the
popes
and
gets
its
name
from
having
the
figure
of
peter
in
a
bark
and
casting
his
net
into
the
sea
engraved
upon
it
above
this
figure
is
cut
the
name
of
the
reigning
pontiff
it
is
the
first
among
the
rings
but
the
second
in
the
class
of
seals
since
it
only
serves
as
the
privy
seal
or
signet
used
on
apostolic
briefs
and
matters
of
subordinate
consequence
whereas
the
great
seal
is
used
to
impress
the
heads
of
ss
peter
and
paul
in
lead
sometimes
but
rarely
in
gold
on
papal
bulls
at
first
this
ring
was
a
private
and
not
an
official
one
of
the
pope
for
in
a
letter
from
perugia
of
march
addressed
by
clement
iv
to
his
nephew
peter
le
gros
he
says
that
he
writes
to
him
and
to
his
other
relatives
not
bulla
sed
sub
piscatoris
sigillo
quo
romani
pontifices
in
suis
secretis
from
which
we
gather
that
the
ring
was
in
use
some
time
before
but
by
whom
introduced
is
unknown
as
is
also
the
precise
period
when
it
became
official
although
this
happened
during
one
or
other
of
the
xvth
century
pontificates
perhaps
the
first
time
that
the
now
familiar
expression
under
the
ring
is
met
with
in
the
manner
of
a
formal
statement
or
curial
formula
such
as
it
has
been
ever
since
retained
is
in
a
document
of
nicholas
dated
from
rome
on
the
of
april
the
institution
of
this
office
is
extremely
ancient
but
like
most
others
of
the
court
it
has
had
different
names
and
increased
or
diminished
attributions
at
various
periods
the
modern
romans
take
a
legitimate
pride
in
being
able
to
deduce
many
of
their
great
court
offices
from
the
corresponding
ones
of
the
cæsars
to
whom
their
sovereign
has
succeeded
thus
this
officer
is
sometimes
called
in
classical
latin
such
an
one
being
mentioned
by
the
historian
ammianus
marcellinus
xv
and
his
office
which
is
found
in
of
xiv
among
the
members
of
the
household
of
gregory
the
great
in
the
year
there
was
a
certain
paterius
of
the
holy
see
corresponding
to
the
modern
of
the
apostolic
prothonotaries
the
dean
being
he
had
to
make
known
to
the
pope
the
names
of
those
who
solicited
the
favor
of
an
interview
and
it
is
probable
that
he
also
gave
as
is
now
given
along
with
the
name
some
account
of
the
quality
and
business
of
the
visitor
for
fear
that
the
pontiff
should
be
unnecessarily
intruded
upon
or
brought
in
contact
with
unworthy
and
perhaps
dangerous
characters
investigators
into
the
origin
of
the
offices
of
the
holy
see
have
fixed
upon
this
person
as
the
remote
predecessor
of
the
present
di
but
all
the
charges
of
the
palace
having
been
remodelled
and
placed
nearly
on
their
present
footing
about
four
hundred
and
fifty
years
ago
and
many
of
the
court
records
having
been
lost
or
stolen
during
the
disturbed
era
between
the
pontificates
of
clement
and
martin
which
includes
the
periods
of
avignon
and
the
schism
the
authentic
roll
of
the
holders
of
these
high
offices
of
state
rarely
begins
earlier
than
the
xvth
century
thus
the
first
grand
chamberlain
of
the
modern
series
is
bindaccio
ricasoli
of
florence
who
was
aulæ
to
john
xxiii
in
the
present
one
is
monsignor
a
roman
who
however
has
become
majordomo
by
monsignor
promotion
the
di
being
constantly
in
company
with
exalted
personages
who
seek
an
audience
of
the
holy
father
and
wait
their
turn
in
or
at
all
events
pass
through
the
which
opens
immediately
into
the
must
be
distinguished
for
good
breeding
and
courtliness
and
serve
as
a
model
to
his
subordinates
in
that
august
apartment
lest
it
be
said
of
him
manners
had
not
the
repose
that
marks
the
caste
of
vere
de
hence
we
are
prepared
to
find
the
noblest
families
of
italy
represented
in
the
office
and
notice
such
patrician
names
as
odescalchi

etc
uditore
the
auditor
of
his
holiness
is
the
most
intimate
privy
councillor
and
canonist
of
the
pope
he
is
third
in
rank
of
the
palatine
prelates
and
lived
in
the
quirinal
where
his
offices
and
the
archives
were
situated
until
the
present
iniquitous
occupation
since
which
they
have
been
removed
to
the
torlonia
palace
near
the
vatican
this
office
was
instituted
by
paul
ii
and
the
first
to
hold
it
was
the
renowned
j
millini
a
roman
who
was
at
the
same
time
bishop
of
urbino
which
was
administered
by
some
one
else
in
his
name
he
later
became
a
cardinal
under
sixtus
in
his
successor
at
the
present
time
is
monsignor
sagretti
up
to
this
century
the
power
and
general
influence
of
the
auditor
were
extraordinary
since
he
had
a
court
of
justice
and
ample
jurisdiction
even
exercising
in
the
name
of
the
pope
the
supremacy
of
appeal
in
many
matters
for
this
reason
the
great
epigraphist
morcelli
who
wrote
before
these
judicial
functions
were
abolished
called
him
sacrarum
formerly
he
gave
audience
to
all
comers
about
matters
of
equity
and
appeal
on
tuesdays
in
his
apartment
at
the
quirinal
standing
in
his
prelatic
robes
behind
a
throne
supposed
by
a
sort
of
fiction
to
be
then
occupied
by
the
pope
hence
he
was
called
in
choice
latin
vice
in
of
his
holiness
the
common
italian
appellation
is
only
a
corrupt
rendering
of
the
latin
this
post
has
always
been
occupied
by
one
of
the
ablest
jurists
in
italy
and
even
now
the
auditor
must
be
both
very
learned
and
most
incorruptible
from
the
part
that
he
takes
officially
in
filling
vacant
sees
and
making
other
important
nominations
maestro
del
sacro
palazzo
the
master
of
the
holy
apostolic
palace
sacri
palatii
is
one
of
the
most
distinguished
members
for
piety
and
doctrine
of
the
dominican
order
he
is
the
official
theologian
and
usually
a
consultor
of
several
roman
congregations
more
nearly
concerned
with
matters
of
faith
and
morals
as
the
inquisition
indulgences
and
relics
index
etc
he
ranks
fourth
among
the
palatine
prelates
and
resided
until
the
late
invasion
in
the
quirinal
palace
with
his
and
two
lay
brothers
of
his
order
he
is
considered
an
honorary
auditor
of
the
rota
and
as
such
has
a
place
with
the
prelates
of
this
class
in
the
papal
chapels
and
reunions
he
retains
the
habit
of
his
order
but
wears
on
his
hat
a
black
prelatical
band
he
is
president
of
the
theological
faculty
in
the
roman
university
and
the
person
to
whom
was
entrusted
the
censorship
of
the
press
the
origin
of
this
office
dates
from
the
year
when
dominic
who
established
the
order
of
friars
preachers
suggested
to
honorius
iii
that
it
would
be
proper
if
some
one
were
charged
to
give
religious
instruction
to
the
many
servants
of
cardinals
prelates
and
others
who
used
to
spend
their
time
idly
in
useless
talk
and
slanderous
gossip
with
their
brethren
of
the
papal
palace
while
their
masters
were
expecting
an
audience
or
engaged
with
his
holiness
the
pope
was
pleased
and
at
once
appointed
dominic
to
the
good
work
who
began
by
explaining
the
epistles
of
s
paul
the
fruit
of
these
pious
conferences
was
so
apparent
that
the
pope
determined
to
perpetuate
them
under
the
direction
of
a
dominican
besides
the
more
familiar
instructions
which
were
given
at
first
extempore
it
was
arranged
later
that
while
the
pope
and
court
were
listening
to
the
preacher
appointed
to
sermonize
in
the
palace
during
advent
and
lent
the
papal
domestics
and
other
servants
should
also
have
the
benefit
of
formal
discourses
but
in
another
part
of
the
building
it
was
always
the
father
doctor
who
held
forth
to
them
until
the
xvith
century
when
the
duties
of
his
office
becoming
more
onerous
especially
by
reason
of
the
many
attempts
to
misuse
the
art
of
printing
to
corrupt
faith
and
morals
in
rome
itself
the
obligation
devolved
upon
his
companion
or
who
also
holds
three
days
of
catechism
in
preparation
for
each
of
the
four
general
communions
that
are
given
yearly
in
the
palace
this
deputy
is
appointed
by
the
master
and
is
a
person
of
consequence
succeeding
sometimes
to
the
higher
office
the
present
master
is
vincenzo
maria
gatti
when
the
learned
alexander
became
pope
the
master
of
the
palace
was
required
to
stand
by
at
his
meals
especially
on
sundays
and
festival
days
and
be
ready
to
propose
difficult
points
of
debate
or
to
enter
into
an
argument
on
any
matter
and
with
any
person
present
as
the
holy
father

have
been
occupants
of
this
office
since
its

to

created
by
of

seventeen
have
been
made

among
them

the

this
office
with
distinction
it
is
one
of

rather

no

we
are
not
surprised
that
the

exhibits
no
such

as
those
that

of
an
act
or
momentum
which
must
be
terminated
or
received
in
a
patient
the
active
power
of
the
agent
is
its
substantial
act
as
virtually
containing
in
itself
all
the
acts
which
the
agent
is
ready
to
produce
according
to
its
nature
this
active
power
may
therefore
be
called
the
virtuality
or
terminability
of
the
act
by
which
the
agent
is
the
momentum
produced
by
such
a
power
stands
to
the
power
in
the
same
ontological
relation
as
the
of
time
to
the
virtuality
of
eternity
and
as
the
ubication
of
a
point
in
space
to
the
virtuality
of
immensity
for
in
all
these
cases
there
is
question
of
nothing
else
than
of
an
extrinsic
terminability
and
an
extrinsic
term
we
may
therefore
in
treating
of
motive
powers
and
momentums
follow
the
same
order
of
questions
which
we
have
followed
in
our
articles
on
space
and
duration
but
the
subject
which
we
are
about
to
investigate
has
a
special
feature
of
its
own
because
in
the
exertion
of
active
power
and
consequently
in
the
momentums
produced
there
is
something
which
is
not
to
be
met
with
either
in
the
or
in
the
for
the
and
the
are
mere
terms
of
intervals
or
distances
and
do
not
partake
in
their
continuity
from
which
it
follows
that
they
are
not
quantities
but
merely
terms
of
quantities
whereas
the
momentum
of
motion
is
the
formal
principle
of
the
real
changes
produced
by
the
agent
in
the
patient
and
these
changes
admit
of
different
degrees
and
thus
by
their
greater
or
less
magnitude
reveal
the
greater
or
less
intensity
of
the
exertion
the
reason
of
this
difference
is
very
plain
for
the
and
the
are
not
efficiently
produced
by
eternity
and
immensity
for
these
divine
attributes
do
not
connote
action
their
origin
is
not
to
be
traced
to
action
but
to
resultation
as
we
have
explained
in
our
preceding
articles
the
entity
of
every
creature
on
the
contrary
proceeds
from
god
as
efficient
cause
that
is
it
does
not
merely
result
from
the
existence
of
other
things
but
it
is
actively
produced
and
since
an
act
produced
must
have
some
degree
of
perfection
creatures
are
more
or
less
perfect
as
to
their
entity
and
therefore
have
in
their
own
act
a
greater
or
less
power
of
acting
according
to
the
degree
of
their
entitative
perfection
this
explains
why
it
is
that
there
is
intensity
in
all
action
and
in
all
act
produced
whereas
there
is
no
intensity
in
the
and
the
but
apart
from
this
special
feature
the
questions
regarding
active
powers
actions
and
the
acts
produced
are
entirely
similar
to
those
which
we
have
answered
in
treating
of
space
and
of
duration
nay
more
the
same
questions
may
be
viewed
under
three
distinct
aspects
first
with
reference
to
the
divine
power
and
its
causality
of
contingent
things
secondly
with
reference
to
second
causes
their
actions
and
the
momentums
produced
by
them
and
thirdly
with
reference
to
these
momentums
themselves
and
the
local
movements
resulting
from
them
this
third
view
of
the
subject
is
the
only
one
immediately
connected
with
the
notions
of
space
and
of
time
and
we
might
limit
ourselves
to
its
consideration
nevertheless
to
shed
more
light
on
the
whole
treatise
we
propose
to
say
something
of
the
other
two
also
for
by
tracing
the
actions
and
the
phenomena
of
the
material
world
to
their
original
sources
we
shall
discover
that
all
different
grades
of
reality
are
linked
with
their
immediate
principles
in
such
a
manner
as
to
exhibit
a
perpetual
analogy
of
the
lower
with
the
higher
till
we
reach
the
highest
god
to
ascertain
the
truth
of
this
proposition
let
us
recall
to
mind
the
main
conclusions
established
by
us
with
respect
to
space
they
were
as
follows
there
is
void
space
that
is
a
capacity
which
does
not
imply
the
presence
of
anything
created
void
space
is
an
objective
reality
void
space
was
not
created
absolute
space
is
the
virtuality
or
extrinsic
terminability
of
immensity
absolute
space
is
not
modified
by
the
presence
of
matter
in
it
that
is
by
its
extrinsic
termination
ubications
are
extrinsic
terms
of
absolute
space
and
their
relations
have
in
space
itself
an
extrinsic
foundation
a
similar
series
of
conclusions
was
established
in
regard
to
duration
they
were
there
is
a
standing
duration
that
is
an
actuality
which
does
not
imply
succession
standing
duration
is
an
objective
reality
standing
duration
is
not
created
standing
duration
is
the
virtuality
or
extrinsic
terminability
of
eternity
standing
duration
is
not
modified
by
the
existence
in
it
of
created
things
that
is
by
its
extrinsic
termination
the
of
creatures
are
extrinsic
terms
of
standing
duration
and
their
relations
have
in
standing
duration
their
extrinsic
foundation
before
we
give
the
analogous
conclusions
concerning
active
powers
and
their
causality
we
have
to
premise
that
all
power
ready
to
act
is
said
to
be
actu
or
in
the
act
with
respect
to
its
termination
and
term
or
act
which
it
is
ready
to
produce
its
action
is
its
termination
and
it
consists
in
the
causation
of
a
this
second
act
inasmuch
as
it
exists
in
its
proper
term
potency
or
subject
is
called
in
facto
that
is
an
action
wholly
complete
though
the
action
proper
is
always
for
it
consists
in
the
very
production
of
such
a
second
act
as
we
have
just
stated
the
result
of
this
production
is
the
existence
of
a
new
reality
substantial
or
accidental
according
to
the
nature
of
the
act
produced
this
terminology
we
shall
use
here
for
the
parallel
development
of
the
three
classes
of
questions
which
we
have
to
answer
of
first
then
with
regard
to
the
primary
origin
of
active
and
moving
powers
we
lay
down
the
following
conclusions
there
is
some
absolute
power
that
is
a
first
act
which
has
no
need
of
producing
any
second
act
absolute
power
is
an
objective
reality
absolute
power
is
uncreated
absolute
power
is
the
virtuality
or
extrinsic
terminability
of
the
act
by
which
god
is
absolute
power
is
not
modified
by
the
production
of
effects
that
is
by
its
extrinsic
termination
the
beings
thus
produced
are
extrinsic
terms
of
power
and
although
owing
to
their
intrinsic
perfection
which
may
be
greater
or
less
they
can
be
related
to
one
another
by
an
intrinsic
foundation
yet
their
have
only
an
extrinsic
foundation
to
wit
omnipotence
some
of
these
propositions
are
so
obvious
that
they
might
have
been
omitted
but
for
the
object
we
have
in
view
of
pointing
out
the
parallelism
of
absolute
power
with
space
and
duration
the
first
of
these
conclusions
is
proved
thus
all
first
act
which
naturally
needs
to
produce
some
second
act
has
an
intrinsic
and
natural
ordination
to
something
distinct
from
itself
for
all
effect
is
really
distinct
from
its
efficient
principle
but
it
can
not
be
admitted
without
absurdity
that
every
first
act
has
such
an
intrinsic
and
natural
ordination
for
if
everything
were
thus
ordained
to
something
else
all
things
would
tend
to
some
subordinate
end
while
there
would
be
no
supreme
end
at
all
for
nothing
that
is
ordained
to
something
else
can
rank
as
the
supreme
end
on
the
other
hand
no
subordinate
ends
can
be
admitted
without
a
supreme
end
and
therefore
there
must
be
some
first
act
which
has
no
intrinsic
necessity
of
producing
any
second
act
such
a
first
act
is
altogether
absolute
the
second
conclusion
is
evident
for
what
we
call
here
first
is
not
an
imperfect
and
incomplete
act
since
it
needs
no
termination
nor
is
it
a
result
of
mental
abstraction
and
analysis
but
a
perfect
principle
of
real
operations
for
the
epithet
by
which
we
characterize
it
does
not
imply
that
it
lacks
anything
in
its
entity
but
on
the
contrary
it
means
that
it
already
contains
eminently
the
whole
reality
of
the
effects
which
it
is
competent
to
produce
hence
it
is
clear
that
if
such
effects
are
objective
realities
the
first
act
on
which
their
production
depends
is
an
objective
reality
and
a
much
better
one
too
the
third
conclusion
needs
no
proof
it
being
evident
that
whatever
is
created
must
tend
to
the
end
of
its
creation
which
is
the
manifestation
of
the
perfections
of
its
creator
this
manifestation
implies
action
a
transition
of
the
first
act
to
its
second
act
accordingly
a
first
act
which
has
no
necessary
ordination
to
second
acts
can
not
be
created
the
fourth
conclusion
follows
from
the
third
since
an
uncreated
act
can
be
nothing
else
than
the
act
by
which
god
is
this
act
inasmuch
as
it
eminently
contains
the
reality
of
all
possible
things
is
extrinsically
terminable
and
as
thus
terminable
it
exhibits
itself
as
a
act
but
since
god
has
no
need
of
creatures
such
a
first
act
has
no
need
of
extrinsic
terminations
and
as
first
it
constitutes
omnipotence
or
absolute
power
this
power
in
its
infinite
simplicity
has
an
infinite
range
as
it
extends
to
all
conceivable
reality
the
fifth
conclusion
will
be
easily
understood
by
reflecting
that
the
extrinsic
termination
of
active
power
consists
in
giving
existence
to
contingent
things
by
efficient
action
now
to
act
efficiently
does
not
bring
about
any
intrinsic
change
in
the
agent
for
all
intrinsic
change
follows
from
passion
which
is
the
opposite
of
action
nor
does
god
when
giving
existence
and
active
powers
to
any
number
of
creatures
weaken
his
own
power
for
the
power
imparted
to
creatures
is
not
a
portion
of
the
divine
power
but
a
product
of
creation
and
nothing
in
fact
but
the
created
act
itself
for
as
all
contingent
things
are
created
for
the
manifestation
of
perfections
all
creatures
must
be
active
and
as
everything
acts
as
it
is
in
act
the
act
being
the
principle
of
the
acting
it
follows
that
all
act
produced
by
creation
is
an
active
power
of
greater
or
less
perfection
according
to
the
part
it
is
destined
to
fill
in
the
plans
of
its
maker
this
shows
that
the
act
by
which
a
creature
is
bears
a
resemblance
to
the
act
by
which
god
is
inasmuch
as
it
virtually
contains
in
itself
all
those
acts
which
it
is
fit
to
produce
according
to
its
nature
but
since
all
contingent
act
is
extrinsic
to
god
divine
omnipotence
is
not
entitatively
and
intrinsically
more
actuated
by
creation
than
by
though
if
god
creates
any
being
from
the
term
produced
he
will
acquire
the
real
denomination
of
creator
thus
the
existence
of
a
contingent
being
is
the
existence
of
a
real
term
which
extrinsically
terminates
the
virtuality
of
act
in
which
it
is
eminently
contained
its
relation
to
its
creator
is
one
of
total
dependence
whilst
relation
to
it
is
that
of
first
causality
the
foundation
of
this
relation
is
the
action
which
proceeds
from
god
and
terminates
in
the
creature
the
first
part
of
the
sixth
conclusion
that
beings
produced
by
creation
are
extrinsic
terms
of
power
has
just
been
explained
but
we
say
moreover
that
the
entitative
distances
between
such
beings
have
an
extrinsic
foundation
in
omnipotence
by
we
mean
the
difference
in
degree
between
distinct
beings
between
a
man
and
a
tree
as
we
have
explained
in
another
place
and
we
say
that
as
the
distance
between
two
material
points
in
space
has
its
extrinsic
foundation
in
the
virtuality
of
immensity
so
also
the
entitative
distance
of
two
beings
has
its
extrinsic
foundation
in
the
virtuality
of
infinite
act
that
is
in
divine
omnipotence
in
fact
the
different
degrees
of
entity
conceivable
between
the
tree
and
the
man
are
all
virtually
contained
in
omnipotence
just
as
all
the
distinct
ubications
possible
between
two
points
are
virtually
in
immensity
hence
the
foundation
of
such
entitative
distances
is
extrinsic
to
the
beings
compared
in
the
same
manner
as
the
foundation
of
local
distances
but
the
terms
produced
by
creative
action
inasmuch
as
they
possess
a
greater
or
less
perfection
in
their
individual
constitution
can
be
compared
with
one
another
according
to
the
relative
degree
of
their
intrinsic
reality
and
thus
besides
the
extrinsic
relation
just
mentioned
they
have
a
mutual
relativity
arising
from
an
intrinsic
foundation
the
relative
degree
of
reality
of
a
contingent
being
becomes
known
to
us
through
the
relative
intensity
of
its
active
power
which
implies
that
the
beings
compared
have
powers
of
the
same
species
if
they
are
not
of
the
same
species
the
comparison
will
give
no
result
before
leaving
this
part
of
our
subject
we
have
to
notice
that
as
the
ubication
so
also
the
act
produced
by
creation
can
be
considered
both
absolutely
and
respectively
a
created
act
considered
absolutely
is
an
act
intrinsically
completed
by
its
essential
potency
and
constitutes
the
being
as
it
is
actu
the
same
act
considered
respectively
or
as
ordained
to
something
else
is
a
power
ready
to
act
and
thus
it
is
actu
with
regard
to
all
the
acts
which
it
is
able
to
produce
the
essential
act
of
a
contingent
being
be
it
considered
absolutely
or
respectively
bears
no
proportion
to
the
perfection
of
its
creator
no
more
indeed
than
a
point
in
space
to
immensity
or
a
of
time
to
eternity
hence
all
contingent
act
or
power
whatever
be
its
perfection
or
intensity
as
compared
with
god
is
like
nothing
it
is
only
when
a
created
act
or
power
is
compared
with
another
of
the
same
kind
that
we
can
establish
a
proportion
between
them
as
to
degrees
of
perfection
and
of
intensity
these
degrees
are
measured
by
comparing
the
relative
intensities
of
the
effects
produced
by
distinct
causes
of
the
same
kind
acting
under
the
same
conditions
the
quantity
of
efficient
power
may
be
conceived
as
a
virtual
sum
of
degrees
of
power
in
this
particular
the
quantity
of
power
differs
entirely
from
the
quantity
of
distance
because
this
latter
can
not
be
conceived
as
a
virtual
sum
of
ubications
the
reason
of
this
difference
is
that
ubications
as
being
simple
points
have
no
quantity
and
therefore
can
not
by
addition
make
up
a
continuous
quantity
whereas
the
degrees
of
power
always
possess
intensity
and
are
quantities
hence
their
sum
is
a
quantity
of
the
same
kind
it
may
be
useful
to
remark
that
all
continuous
quantity
has
a
necessary
connection
with
the
quantity
of
power
and
that
all
extension
owes
its
being
to
the
efficacy
of
some
motive
principle
in
fact
all
intervals
whether
of
space
or
of
time
are
reckoned
among
continuous
quantities
only
on
account
of
the
quantity
of
continuous
movement
which
can
be
made
or
is
actually
made
in
them
as
we
have
explained
in
a
preceding
article
but
the
quantity
of
movement
is
itself
to
be
traced
to
the
intensity
of
the
momentum
produced
by
the
agent
and
the
momentum
to
the
intensity
of
the
motive
power
as
soon
as
movement
is
communicated
to
a
point
its
ubication
begins
to
shift
and
to
extend
a
continuous
line
in
space
and
its
too
for
the
same
reason
begins
to
flow
and
to
extend
continuous
time
when
the
quantity
of
power
is
expressed
by
a
number
its
value
is
determined
as
we
have
stated
by
the
intensity
of
its
efficiency
in
a
given
time
and
fixed
conditions
the
unit
of
intensity
by
which
the
amount
of
the
effect
produced
is
measured
is
arbitrary
for
there
is
no
natural
unit
for
the
degrees
of
intensity
it
being
evident
that
such
degrees
can
be
divided
and
subdivided
without
end
just
like
the
continuum
hence
the
numbers
by
which
we
express
degrees
of
intensity
are
only
virtually
discrete
just
as
those
by
which
we
express
continuous
quantities
the
ordinary
unit
assumed
for
the
measure
of
intensity
is
that
degree
of
intensity
which
causes
a
unit
of
weight
to
measure
a
unit
of
distance
in
a
unit
of
time
as
all
these
units
are
arbitrary
it
is
evident
that
such
is
also
the
unit
of
intensity
let
us
remark
also
that
the
power
of
natural
causes
has
in
its
action
a
twofold
continuity
that
is
with
regard
both
to
space
and
to
duration
as
long
as
a
natural
cause
exists
it
acts
without
interruption
owing
to
its
intrinsic
determination
provided
there
be
as
there
is
always
in
fact
some
subject
capable
of
being
acted
upon
by
it
this
constitutes
the
continuity
of
action
with
regard
to
duration
on
the
other
hand
the
motive
power
of
such
natural
causes
is
exerted
according
to
the
newtonian
law
throughout
an
indefinite
sphere
as
we
have
shown
in
another
place
and
this
constitutes
the
continuity
of
action
through
space
moreover
if
the
point
acted
upon
approaches
the
agent
or
recedes
from
it
the
continuous
change
of
distance
will
be
accompanied
by
a
continuous
change
of
action
and
thus
the
intensity
of
the
act
produced
by
the
agent
will
increase
or
decrease
in
a
continuous
manner
through
infinitesimal
degrees
corresponding
to
the
infinitesimal
changes
of
local
relations
occurring
in
infinitesimal
instants
of
time
this
relation
of
changes
is
the
base
of
dynamics
but
enough
on
this
point
of
we
may
now
pass
to
the
conclusions
concerning
movement
as
dependent
on
its
proximate
cause
the
power
by
which
the
natural
causes
produce
momentums
of
movement
is
called
this
power
is
to
be
found
both
in
material
and
in
spiritual
beings
but
as
in
spiritual
substances
the
exercise
of
the
motive
power
is
subject
to
their
will
and
consists
in
the
application
of
a
nobler
power
to
the
production
of
a
lower
effect
we
do
not
and
can
not
consider
the
power
of
spiritual
beings
as
merely
for
it
is
above
all
intellective
and
volitive
material
things
on
the
contrary
because
they
possess
no
other
power
than
that
of
moving
are
characterized
by
it
and
are
naturally
determined
to
exercise
it
according
to
a
law
which
they
can
not
elude
it
is
of
these
beings
in
particular
that
the
following
conclusions
are
to
be
understood
there
is
in
all
material
creatures
a
motive
power
that
is
a
first
act
of
moving
which
considered
in
its
absolute
state
has
no
need
of
extrinsic
termination
that
is
of
producing
a
momentum
of
movement
this
motive
power
is
an
objective
reality
the
same
power
is
nothing
accidentally
superadded
to
the
being
of
which
it
is
the
power
this
power
is
the
virtuality
or
extrinsic
terminability
of
the
act
by
which
the
agent
is
this
power
is
not
modified
by
the
production
of
momentums
in
extrinsic
terms
the
momentums
thus
produced
are
second
acts
of
the
motive
power
extrinsic
to
it
and
though
owing
to
their
intensity
which
may
be
greater
or
less
they
can
be
related
to
one
another
through
an
intrinsic
foundation
yet
their
entitative
distances
have
only
an
extrinsic
foundation
to
wit
the
power
some
of
these
propositions
are
quite
evident
but
our
present
object
is
not
only
to
explain
what
may
require
a
special
discussion
but
also
and
principally
to
dissect
our
subject
in
such
a
manner
as
to
make
it
manifest
that
a
perpetual
analogy
exists
between
the
conditions
and
the
principles
of
all
kinds
of
continuum
and
that
in
all
of
them
the
transition
from
the
absolute
to
the
relative
from
the
cause
to
the
effect
and
from
the
formal
reason
to
its
formal
result
is
made
through
a
like
process
and
through
similar
degrees
for
this
reason
we
think
that
even
those
conclusions
which
seem
too
obvious
to
deserve
mention
become
interesting
and
serve
a
good
purpose
for
in
the
parallel
treatment
of
analogous
subjects
those
things
which
are
clearer
throw
light
on
those
which
are
more
abstruse
and
about
which
we
often
feel
a
certain
hesitation
the
first
of
our
present
conclusions
needs
only
a
short
explanation
when
we
say
that
in
every
creature
there
is
a
motive
power
which
in
its
absolute
has
no
need
of
producing
a
momentum
we
mean
that
in
every
creature
there
is
an
act
which
is
a
principle
of
activity
but
that
the
exercise
of
this
activity
is
not
required
for
the
substantial
perfection
and
essential
constitution
of
the
creature
itself
though
it
may
be
required
for
some
other
reason
as
we
shall
see
presently
in
fact
every
substance
has
its
own
complete
being
independently
of
accidents
and
since
the
exertion
of
motive
power
is
an
accident
every
substance
is
entitatively
independent
of
it
we
conceive
that
if
god
had
created
nothing
but
an
element
of
matter
such
an
element
would
indeed
on
its
own
part
be
ready
to
act
and
to
produce
a
momentum
of
movement
but
as
there
would
be
no
subject
capable
of
receiving
a
momentum
the
motive
power
would
remain
actu
that
is
without
actual
exertion
and
yet
it
is
evident
that
the
of
other
elements
can
have
no
bearing
on
the
intrinsic
constitution
and
substantial
perfection
of
the
element
in
the
question
therefore
the
power
of
an
element
of
matter
is
a
first
act
which
as
far
as
the
entity
of
the
element
itself
is
concerned
has
no
need
of
producing
any
second
act
nevertheless
since
all
creatures
must
in
some
manner
glorify
god
as
long
as
they
exist
because
such
is
the
true
and
highest
end
of
their
existence
hence
to
every
created
power
some
proportionate
term
or
subject
corresponds
in
which
its
exertion
is
received
without
interruption
in
the
same
manner
as
the
understanding
never
lacks
an
intelligible
object
and
the
sense
never
lacks
a
sensible
term
about
which
to
exercise
itself
by
immanent
operation
the
motive
power
of
inferior
beings
never
fails
to
meet
a
proportionate
that
is
movable
term
and
to
impress
upon
it
a
momentum
of
a
certain
intensity
hence
when
we
regard
not
the
substance
of
natural
things
as
such
but
the
natural
necessity
they
are
under
of
tending
constantly
to
the
ultimate
end
of
their
creation
we
see
that
their
first
act
of
moving
must
always
entail
some
second
act
or
momentum
in
all
the
terms
which
it
can
reach
according
to
its
natural
determination
the
second
conclusion
is
for
if
the
principle
of
real
movement
were
not
an
objective
reality
a
real
effect
would
proceed
from
an
unreal
cause
which
is
absurd
nor
does
it
matter
that
the
power
is
only
a
act
for
as
we
have
explained
above
it
is
first
as
compared
with
the
acts
which
it
can
produce
but
it
is
intrinsically
complete
in
the
entity
of
the
agent
as
it
is
terminated
to
its
substantial
term
the
third
conclusion
is
nothing
but
a
corollary
of
the
axiom
that
in
all
things
the
principle
of
operation
is
the
substantial
act
est
id
quo
agens
and
essendi
est
principium
we
have
proved
in
another
place
that
no
natural
accident
possesses
active
power
or
is
actually
concerned
in
any
of
the
effects
produced
by
the
agent
this
truth
should
be
well
understood
by
the
modern
scientists
who
very
commonly
mistake
the
conditions
of
the
action
for
the
active
principle
of
course
no
creature
can
act
independently
of
accidental
conditions
but
these
conditions
have
no
bearing
on
the
active
power
itself
they
only
determine
formally
and
not
efficiently
the
mode
of
its
application
according
to
a
constant
law
thus
the
distance
of
two
material
points
has
no
influence
on
their
motive
power
or
on
their
mutual
action
but
only
constitutes
the
two
points
in
a
certain
relation
to
one
another
and
when
such
a
relation
is
altered
the
action
is
changed
not
because
the
power
is
modified
but
because
its
determination
to
act
that
is
its
very
nature
demands
that
it
should
in
its
application
follow
the
newtonian
law
of
the
inverse
ratio
of
the
squared
distances
the
philosophers
of
the
old
school
admitted
but
never
proved
that
although
the
substantial
form
is
the
main
principle
of
activity
in
natural
things
nevertheless
this
principle
was
in
need
of
some
accidental
entity
that
it
might
be
proximately
disposed
to
produce
its
act
this
opinion
too
originated
in
the
confusion
of
active
power
with
the
conditions
on
which
the
mode
of
its
exertion
depends
what
they
called
is
now
acknowledged
to
be
not
a
new
kind
of
active
power
superadded
to
the
substantial
forms
but
merely
a
result
of
the
concurrence
of
many
simple
powers
acting
under
determinate
conditions
the
accidental
change
of
the
conditions
entails
the
change
of
the
result
and
action
but
the
active
powers
evidently
remain
the
same
the
ancients
said
also
that
the
substantial
forms
were
the
active
principles
of
substantial
generations
whereas
the
were
the
active
principles
of
mere
alterations
as
we
have
shown
that
the
whole
theory
of
substantial
generations
as
understood
by
the
peripatetic
school
is
based
on
assumption
and
equivocation
and
leads
to
impossibilities
we
may
be
dispensed
from
giving
a
new
refutation
of
the
opinion
last
mentioned
our
fourth
conclusion
directly
follows
from
the
general
principle
that
the
act
by
which
a
thing
has
its
first
being
is
its
principle
of
action
aliquid
primo
est
eo
the
substantial
act
considered
as
to
its
absolute
entity
does
not
connote
action
but
simply
constitutes
the
being
of
which
it
is
the
act
in
order
to
conceive
it
as
an
active
power
we
must
refer
to
the
effects
which
it
virtually
contains
that
is
we
must
consider
its
virtuality
in
this
manner
what
is
a
second
act
with
regard
to
the
substance
of
the
agent
will
be
conceived
as
a
first
act
with
reference
to
the
effects
it
can
produce
according
to
a
received
axiom
secundus
essendi
est
actus
primus
the
fifth
conclusion
notwithstanding
the
contrary
opinion
of
many
philosophers
is
quite
certain
for
all
intrinsic
modification
is
the
result
of
passive
reception
or
passion
now
to
produce
a
momentum
of
movement
is
action
not
passion
therefore
when
such
a
momentum
is
produced
no
other
subject
is
intrinsically
modified
by
it
except
the
one
which
passively
receives
it
it
is
therefore
the
being
which
is
acted
on
not
that
which
acts
that
acquires
an
intrinsic
modification
the
power
of
the
agent
is
not
entitatively
and
intrinsically
more
actuated
by
action
than
by
its
action
is
an
extrinsic
termination
and
gives
it
nothing
but
the
real
denomination
of
agent
by
which
it
is
really
related
to
the
term
acted
on
the
patient
by
its
reception
of
the
momentum
becomes
similarly
related
to
the
agent
as
is
evident
and
the
relation
consists
in
this
that
the
patient
acquires
formally
an
act
which
the
agent
virtually
contains
this
relation
is
of
accidental
causality
on
the
one
side
and
of
accidental
dependence
on
the
other
the
foundation
of
the
relation
is
the
accidental
action
as
coming
from
the
one
and
terminating
in
the
other
as
everything
that
is
in
movement
must
have
received
the
motion
from
a
distinct
agent
according
to
the
principle
quod
movetur
ab
alio
it
follows
that
whatever
is
in
movement
is
accidentally
dependent
on
an
extrinsic
mover
and
since
all
material
elements
are
both
movers
and
moved
they
all
have
a
mutual
accidental
causality
and
dependence
our
sixth
conclusion
is
sufficiently
clear
from
what
has
been
said
concerning
the
sixth
conclusion
of
the
preceding
series
the
momentum
of
movement
is
evidently
the
second
act
of
the
motive
power
that
is
the
extrinsic
term
of
its
exertion
the
entitative
distance
between
two
momentums
produced
by
the
same
mover
is
an
extrinsic
relation
for
its
foundation
is
the
virtuality
of
the
act
by
which
the
agent
is
as
has
been
explained
above
but
the
same
momentums
as
possessing
greater
or
less
intensity
can
also
be
compared
with
one
another
according
to
their
intrinsic
entity
or
degree
and
thus
they
will
be
found
to
have
a
mutual
relation
arising
from
an
intrinsic
foundation
as
the
ubication
so
also
the
momentum
produced
by
accidental
action
can
be
considered
both
absolutely
and
respectively
the
momentum
considered
absolutely
is
an
act
received
in
a
subject
an
absolute
momentum
an
extrinsic
term
of
the
virtuality
of
the
motive
principle
and
as
such
a
momentum
is
only
one
out
of
the
innumerable
acts
which
can
proceed
from
the
agent
it
has
an
entity
infinitely
less
than
that
of
the
agent
it
is
evident
in
fact
that
between
a
substantial
and
an
accidental
act
there
must
be
an
infinite
entitative
disproportion
both
because
no
substance
can
be
substantially
changed
by
its
accidents
and
because
the
substantial
act
can
never
be
exhausted
and
not
even
weakened
by
the
production
of
accidental
acts
as
we
have
established
in
another
place
the
momentum
is
considered
respectively
when
it
is
compared
with
another
momentum
in
which
case
we
can
find
the
relation
of
the
one
to
the
other
as
to
intensity
this
intensity
is
measured
by
the
quantity
of
the
movement
to
which
they
give
rise
when
not
counteracted
the
unit
of
intensity
is
arbitrary
in
the
momentums
as
in
their
principles
for
the
same
reason
that
is
because
in
neither
case
a
natural
unit
of
intensity
can
be
found
the
number
expressing
the
relative
intensity
of
a
momentum
is
only
virtually
discrete
because
the
momentum
is
only
virtually
compounded
since
it
is
not
a
number
of
distinct
acts
but
one
act
equivalent
to
many
and
its
the
production
of
a
momentum
entails
movement
the
general
definition
of
movement
according
to
aristotle
and
thomas
is
existentis
in
potentia
ut
in
or
as
we
would
say
an
actual
passage
from
one
potential
state
to
another
now
all
created
being
is
potential
in
two
manners
first
on
account
of
its
passive
receptivity
secondly
on
account
of
its
affectibility
which
is
a
consequence
of
its
passivity
as
we
have
explained
in
the
of
real
hence
the
momentum
of
movement
inasmuch
as
it
is
received
in
the
patient
actuates
its
passive
potency
and
inasmuch
as
its
reception
entails
a
certain
mode
of
being
it
affects
its
resultant
potentiality
but
besides
this
double
potentiality
which
is
intrinsic
to
the
subject
there
is
another
potentiality
which
refers
to
an
extrinsic
term
and
for
this
reason
movement
is
considered
both
as
it
is
a
modification
of
its
subject
and
as
it
points
at
an
extrinsic
term
with
regard
to
its
subject
movement
is
usually
divided
into
and
it
is
called
immanent
when
it
results
from
immanent
acts
as
when
the
soul
directs
its
attention
to
such
or
such
an
object
of
thought
and
it
is
called
transient
when
it
brings
about
a
change
in
a
subject
distinct
from
the
agent
as
when
a
man
moves
a
stone
or
when
the
sun
moves
the
earth
but
this
is
inaccurate
language
for
what
is
transient
in
these
cases
is
the
not
the
with
regard
to
its
term
movement
is
divided
into
two
kinds
that
is
movement
to
a
place
ad
and
movement
towards
a
certain
degree
of
perfection
or
intensity
of
power
the
first
is
called
movement
of
which
we
will
speak
presently
the
second
is
subdivided
into
and
intension
and
remission
are
the
acquisition
or
loss
of
some
degree
of
perfection
or
of
intensity
with
regard
to
power
and
qualities
alteration
is
the
passage
from
one
kind
of
quality
or
property
to
another
thus
in
water
heat
is
subject
to
intension
and
remission
but
when
the
cohesive
force
of
the
molecules
is
superseded
by
the
expansive
force
of
vapor
there
is
alteration
it
is
important
to
notice
that
there
is
no
in
primitive
elements
of
matter
the
exertion
of
their
power
varies
indeed
according
to
the
newtonian
law
but
the
power
itself
is
always
exactly
the
same
as
its
principle
is
the
substantial
act
which
can
not
be
modified
by
accidental
action
it
is
only
in
material
compounds
that
the
can
be
admitted
for
the
reason
that
the
active
powers
and
qualities
in
them
are
a
result
of
composition
hence
a
change
in
the
mode
of
the
composition
brings
about
a
change
in
the
resultant
so
also
in
spiritual
substances
there
is
no
because
their
active
faculties
are
always
substantially
the
same
true
it
is
that
the
intellect
has
also
its
passivity
with
regard
to
intelligible
species
and
that
it
acts
by
so
much
the
more
easily
and
perfectly
in
proportion
as
it
is
better
furnished
with
intelligible
species
distinctly
expressed
and
arranged
according
to
their
logical
and
objective
connection
but
this
can
not
mean
that
the
active
power
of
the
intellect
can
be
increased
but
only
that
it
can
be
placed
in
more
suitable
conditions
for
its
operations
and
the
like
is
to
be
said
of
all
acquired
habits
for
they
give
a
greater
facility
of
acting
not
by
intensifying
the
intrinsic
power
but
by
placing
the
active
faculty
in
such
conditions
as
are
more
favorable
for
its
operation
but
let
us
revert
to
local
movement
this
movement
may
be
defined
as
act
of
gliding
through
successive
such
a
gliding
alters
the
relations
of
one
body
to
another
as
is
evident
but
it
involves
no
new
intrinsic
modification
of
the
subject
as
long
as
the
subject
continues
to
move
under
the
same
momentum
its
intrinsic
mode
of
being
remains
uniformly
the
same
while
its
extrinsic
relations
to
other
bodies
are
in
continual
change
hence
the
local
movement
of
any
point
of
matter
merely
consists
in
the
act
of
extending
from
ubication
to
ubication
or
as
we
may
say
in
evolution
of
the
intensity
of
the
momentum
into
continuous
the
reason
of
this
evolution
is
that
the
momentum
impressed
on
a
subject
has
not
only
a
definite
intensity
but
also
a
definite
direction
in
space
whence
it
follows
that
the
subject
which
receives
the
momentum
receives
a
determination
to
describe
a
line
in
a
definite
direction
which
it
must
follow
owing
to
its
inertia
with
an
impetus
equal
to
the
intensity
of
the
momentum
itself
and
in
this
manner
a
material
point
by
the
successive
flowing
of
its
ubication
describes
a
line
in
space
or
evolves
the
intensity
of
its
momentum
into
extension
hence
of
local
movement
we
can
predicate
both
and
the
intensity
is
the
formal
principle
which
by
actuating
the
inertia
or
mobility
of
the
subject
evolves
itself
into
extension
the
extension
is
the
actual
evolution
of
the
momentum
and
constitutes
the
essence
of
local
movement
which
is
always
and
this
is
what
is
especially
pointed
out
in
words
est
actus
existentis
in
potentia
ut
in
the
refers
to
the
intensity
which
is
not
but
has
a
definite
actuality
whilst
the
potentia
ut
in
clearly
refers
to
the
evolution
of
extension
which
is
continually
under
the
influx
of
said
act
accordingly
local
movement
is
both
intensive
and
extensive
but
this
last
epithet
is
to
be
looked
upon
as
equivalent
to
not
to
for
it
is
the
line
drawn
or
the
track
of
the
movement
already
made
that
is
properly
whereas
the
movement
itself
is
the
act
of
extending
it
the
formal
intensity
of
local
movement
is
called
we
say
the
intensity
because
movement
has
also
a
intensity
the
formal
intensity
regards
the
rate
of
movement
of
each
element
of
matter
taken
by
itself
and
it
is
greater
or
less
according
as
it
evolves
a
greater
or
a
less
extension
in
equal
times
the
material
intensity
regards
the
quantity
of
matter
which
is
moving
with
a
given
velocity
and
is
measured
by
the
product
of
the
velocity
into
the
mass
of
the
moving
body
this
product
is
called
the
momentum
of
the
body
or
its
quantity
of
movement
local
movement
is
subject
to
three
affections
and
in
fact
since
local
movement
consists
in
extending
with
a
certain
velocity
in
a
certain
direction
it
is
susceptible
of
being
modified
either
by
a
change
of
velocity
which
will
intensify
or
weaken
it
or
by
a
change
of
direction
that
is
by
inflexion
so
long
however
as
no
agent
disturbs
the
actual
movement
already
imparted
to
a
body
the
movement
must
necessarily
continue
in
the
same
direction
and
with
the
same
velocity
for
matter
owing
to
its
inertia
can
not
modify
its
own
state
this
amounts
to
saying
that
the
tendency
uniformly
to
preserve
its
rate
and
its
direction
is
not
an
accidental
affection
but
the
very
nature
of
local
movement
this
being
premised
we
are
going
to
establish
a
series
of
conclusions
concerning
movement
and
its
affections
parallel
to
that
which
we
have
developed
in
the
preceding
pages
respecting
power
and
its
exertions
the
reader
will
see
that
the
chain
of
our
analogies
must
here
end
for
since
movement
is
not
action
it
affects
nothing
new
and
produces
no
extrinsic
terms
but
only
entails
changes
of
local
relations
on
the
other
hand
the
affections
of
local
movement
are
not
of
a
transient
but
of
an
immanent
character
and
thus
they
give
rise
to
no
new
entity
but
are
themselves
identified
with
the
movement
of
which
they
are
the
modes
our
conclusions
are
the
following
there
is
in
all
local
movement
something
permanent
that
is
a
general
determination
of
a
lasting
character
which
has
no
need
of
being
individuated
in
one
manner
more
than
in
another
this
constant
determination
is
an
objective
reality
this
same
determination
is
nothing
accidentally
superadded
to
local
movement
this
determination
is
the
virtuality
of
the
momentum
of
movement
or
the
act
of
evolving
extension
in
a
definite
direction
this
determination
is
not
intrinsically
modified
by
any
accidental
modification
of
local
movement
the
affections
of
local
movement
are
intrinsic
and
intransitive
modes
which
identify
themselves
with
the
movement
which
they
modify
the
first
of
these
conclusions
is
briefly
proved
thus
whatever
is
a
subject
of
real
modifications
has
something
permanent
local
movement
is
a
subject
of
real
modifications
therefore
local
movement
involves
something
permanent
the
second
conclusion
is
the
third
conclusion
too
is
evident
for
whatever
is
accidentally
superadded
to
a
thing
can
be
accidentally
taken
away
and
therefore
can
not
belong
to
the
thing
permanently
and
invariably
hence
the
constant
and
fixed
determination
in
question
can
not
be
an
accident
of
local
movement
the
fourth
conclusion
is
a
corollary
of
the
third
for
nothing
is
necessarily
permanent
in
local
movement
except
that
which
constitutes
its
essence
now
its
essence
lies
in
this
that
it
must
evolve
extension
at
the
rate
and
in
the
direction
determined
by
the
momentum
of
which
it
is
the
exponent
therefore
the
permanent
determination
of
which
we
are
speaking
is
nothing
else
than
the
virtuality
of
the
momentum
itself
as
developing
into
extension
and
since
the
momentum
by
which
the
moving
body
is
animated
has
a
determinate
intensity
and
direction
which
virtually
contains
a
determinate
velocity
and
direction
of
movement
it
follows
that
the
permanent
determination
in
question
consists
in
the
actual
tendency
of
movement
to
evolve
uniformly
and
in
a
straight
line
because
velocity
is
the
form
of
movement
and
the
velocity
determined
by
the
intensity
of
the
actual
momentum
is
actually
one
a
straight
because
the
actual
momentum
being
one
it
gives
but
one
direction
to
the
movement
which
therefore
will
be
straight
in
its
tendency
whence
we
conclude
that
it
is
of
the
essence
of
local
movement
to
have
actual
tendency
to
evolve
uniformly
in
a
straight
some
will
object
that
local
movement
may
lack
both
uniformity
and
straightness
this
is
quite
true
but
it
does
not
destroy
our
conclusion
for
as
movement
is
always
and
exists
only
by
infinitesimal
instants
in
which
it
is
impossible
to
admit
more
than
one
velocity
and
one
direction
it
remains
always
true
that
within
every
instant
of
its
existence
the
movement
is
straight
and
uniform
and
that
in
every
such
instant
it
tends
to
continue
in
the
same
direction
and
at
the
same
rate
that
is
with
the
velocity
and
direction
it
actually
possesses
this
velocity
and
direction
may
of
course
be
modified
in
the
following
instant
but
in
the
following
instant
too
the
movement
will
tend
to
evolve
uniformly
and
in
a
straight
line
suitably
to
its
new
velocity
and
direction
whence
it
is
manifest
that
although
in
the
continuation
of
the
movement
there
may
be
a
series
of
different
velocities
and
directions
yet
the
tendency
of
the
movement
is
at
every
instant
of
its
existence
to
extend
uniformly
in
a
straight
line
this
truth
is
the
foundation
of
dynamics
our
fifth
conclusion
is
sufficiently
evident
from
what
we
have
just
said
for
whatever
be
the
intensity
and
direction
of
the
movement
its
determination
to
extend
uniformly
in
a
straight
line
is
not
interfered
with
our
last
conclusion
has
no
need
of
explanation
for
since
the
affections
of
local
movement
are
the
result
of
new
momentums
impressed
on
the
subject
it
is
plain
that
they
are
intrinsic
modes
characterizing
a
movement
individually
different
from
the
movement
that
preceded
the
tendency
to
evolve
uniformly
in
a
straight
line
remains
unimpaired
as
we
have
shown
but
the
movement
itself
becomes
entitatively
quantitatively
different
local
movement
is
divided
into
and
uniform
movement
we
call
that
which
has
a
constant
velocity
for
as
velocity
is
the
form
of
movement
to
say
that
a
movement
is
uniform
is
to
say
that
it
has
but
one
velocity
in
the
whole
of
its
extension
we
usually
call
all
movement
whose
apparent
velocity
is
constant
but
to
say
the
truth
no
rigorously
uniform
movement
exists
in
nature
for
any
appreciable
length
of
time
in
fact
every
element
of
matter
lies
within
the
sphere
of
action
of
all
other
elements
and
is
continually
acted
on
and
continually
receives
new
momentums
the
evident
consequence
of
which
is
that
its
real
movement
must
undergo
a
continuous
change
of
velocity
hence
rigorously
uniform
movement
is
limited
to
infinitesimal
time
varied
movement
is
that
whose
rate
is
continually
changing
it
is
divided
into
and
and
when
the
acceleration
or
the
retardation
arises
from
a
constant
action
which
in
equal
times
imparts
equal
momentums
the
movement
is
said
to
be
accelerated
or
retarded
the
explanation
we
have
given
of
space
duration
and
movement
suffices
if
we
are
not
mistaken
to
show
what
is
the
true
nature
of
the
only
continuous
quantities
which
can
be
found
in
the
real
order
of
things
the
reader
will
have
seen
that
the
source
of
all
continuity
is
motive
power
and
its
exertion
it
is
such
an
exertion
that
engenders
local
movement
and
causes
it
to
be
continuous
in
its
entity
in
its
local
extension
and
in
its
duration
in
fact
why
is
the
local
movement
continuous
its
because
the
motive
action
strengthens
or
weakens
it
by
continuous
infinitesimal
degrees
in
each
successive
infinitesimal
instant
thus
causing
it
to
pass
through
all
the
degrees
of
intensity
designable
between
its
initial
and
its
final
velocity
and
again
why
is
the
local
movement
continuous
its
local
because
it
is
the
property
of
an
action
which
proceeds
from
a
point
in
space
and
is
terminated
to
another
point
in
space
to
give
a
local
direction
to
the
subject
in
which
the
momentum
is
received
whence
it
follows
that
the
subject
under
the
influence
of
such
a
momentum
must
draw
a
continuous
line
in
space
finally
why
is
the
local
movement
continuous
its
because
owing
to
the
continuous
change
of
its
ubication
the
subject
of
the
movement
extends
its
absolute
from
to
in
a
continuous
succession
which
is
nothing
but
the
duration
of
the
movement
hence
absolute
space
and
absolute
duration
which
are
altogether
independent
of
motive
actions
are
not
continuous
but
only
supply
the
extrinsic
reason
of
the
possibility
of
formal
continuums
it
is
matter
in
movement
that
by
the
flowing
of
its
from
to
actually
marks
out
a
continuous
line
in
space
and
by
the
flowing
of
its
from
to
marks
out
a
continuous
line
in
duration
thus
it
is
not
absolute
space
but
the
line
drawn
in
space
that
is
extended
from
to
and
it
is
not
absolute
duration
but
the
line
successively
drawn
in
duration
that
is
extended
from
to
with
regard
to
the
difficulties
which
philosophers
have
raised
at
different
times
against
local
movement
we
have
very
little
to
say
an
ancient
philosopher
when
called
to
answer
some
arguments
against
the
possibility
of
movement
thought
it
sufficient
to
reply
walk
therefore
movement
is
this
answer
was
excellent
but
while
showing
the
inanity
of
the
objections
it
took
no
notice
of
the
fallacies
by
which
they
were
supported
we
might
follow
the
same
course
for
the
arguments
advanced
against
movement
are
by
no
means
formidable
yet
we
will
mention
and
solve
three
of
them
before
dismissing
the
subject
if
a
body
moves
it
moves
where
it
is
not
where
it
is
not
but
it
can
not
move
where
it
is
for
to
move
implies
not
to
remain
where
it
is
and
therefore
bodies
can
not
move
the
answer
is
that
bodies
neither
move
where
they
are
nor
where
they
are
not
but
the
place
where
they
are
the
place
where
they
are
not
a
material
element
can
not
describe
a
line
in
space
between
two
points
without
gliding
through
all
the
intermediate
ubications
but
the
intermediate
ubications
are
infinite
as
infinite
points
can
be
designated
in
any
line
and
the
infinite
can
not
be
passed
over
the
answer
is
that
an
infinite
multitude
can
not
be
measured
by
one
of
its
units
and
for
this
reason
the
infinite
multitude
of
ubications
which
may
be
designated
between
the
terms
of
a
line
can
not
be
measured
by
a
unit
of
the
same
kind
nevertheless
a
line
can
be
measured
by
movement
that
is
not
by
the
ubication
itself
but
the
of
an
ubication
because
the
flowing
of
the
ubication
is
continuous
and
involves
continuous
quantity
and
therefore
it
is
to
be
considered
as
containing
in
itself
its
own
measure
which
is
a
measure
of
length
and
which
may
serve
to
measure
the
whole
line
of
movement
if
the
length
of
a
line
were
an
infinite
sum
of
ubications
that
is
of
mathematical
points
the
objection
would
have
some
weight
but
the
length
of
the
line
is
evidently
not
a
sum
of
points
the
line
is
a
continuous
quantity
evolved
by
the
flowing
of
a
point
it
can
therefore
be
measured
by
the
flowing
of
a
point
for
as
the
line
described
can
be
divided
and
subdivided
without
end
so
also
the
time
employed
in
describing
it
can
be
divided
and
subdivided
without
end
hence
the
length
of
a
line
described
in
a
finite
length
of
time
can
be
conceived
as
an
infinite
virtual
multitude
of
infinitesimal
lengths
just
in
the
same
manner
as
the
time
employed
in
describing
it
can
be
conceived
as
an
infinite
multitude
of
infinitesimal
instants
now
the
infinite
can
measure
the
infinite
and
therefore
it
is
manifest
that
an
infinite
multitude
of
infinitesimal
lengths
can
be
measured
by
the
flowing
of
a
point
through
an
infinite
multitude
of
infinitesimal
instants
the
communication
of
movement
as
we
know
by
experience
requires
time
and
yet
time
arises
from
movement
and
can
not
begin
before
the
movement
is
communicated
how
then
will
movement
be
communicated
the
answer
is
that
time
and
movement
begin
together
and
evolve
simultaneously
in
the
very
act
of
the
communication
of
movement
it
is
not
true
then
that
all
communication
of
movement
requires
time
our
experience
regards
only
the
communication
of
movement
which
of
course
can
not
be
made
except
the
action
of
the
agent
continue
for
a
finite
time
but
movement
is
always
communicated
by
infinitesimal
degrees
in
infinitesimal
instants
and
thus
the
beginning
of
the
motive
action
coincides
with
the
beginning
of
the
movement
and
this
coincides
with
the
beginning
of
its
duration
and
here
we
end
the
considerations
which
we
have
developed
in
our
articles
on
space
duration
and
movement
have
we
think
a
sufficient
importance
to
be
regarded
with
interest
by
those
who
have
a
philosophical
turn
of
mind
the
subjects
which
we
have
endeavored
so
far
to
investigate
are
scarcely
ever
examined
as
deeply
as
they
deserve
by
the
modern
writers
of
philosophical
treatises
but
there
is
no
doubt
that
a
clearer
knowledge
of
those
subjects
must
enable
us
to
extricate
ourselves
from
many
difficulties
to
be
met
in
other
parts
of
metaphysics
it
is
principally
in
order
to
solve
the
sophisms
of
the
idealists
and
of
the
transcendental
pantheists
that
we
need
an
exact
intellectual
notion
of
space
and
of
time
we
see
how
kant
the
father
of
german
idealism
and
pantheism
was
led
into
numerous
errors
by
his
misconception
of
these
two
points
and
how
his
followers
owing
to
a
like
hallucination
succeeded
in
obscuring
the
light
of
their
noble
intellects
and
were
prompted
to
deny
and
revile
the
most
certain
and
fundamental
principles
of
human
reasoning
in
fact
a
mistaken
notion
of
space
lies
at
the
bottom
of
nearly
all
their
philosophical
blunders
if
we
desire
to
refute
their
false
theories
by
direct
and
categorical
arguments
we
must
know
how
far
we
can
trust
the
popular
language
on
space
and
how
we
can
correct
its
inaccuracies
so
as
to
give
precision
to
our
own
phraseology
lest
by
conceding
or
denying
more
than
truth
demands
we
furnish
them
with
the
means
of
retorting
against
our
argumentation
this
is
the
main
reason
that
induced
us
to
treat
of
space
duration
and
movement
in
a
special
series
of
articles
as
we
entertained
the
hope
that
we
might
thus
help
in
cutting
the
ground
from
under
the
feet
of
the
pantheist
by
uprooting
the
very
germ
of
his
manifold
errors
not
yet
methought
the
king
of
terrors
came
my
way
whom
all
men
flee
and
none
esteem
it

but
lo
his

forbidding

i
stood
and
dared
to
look

in

of
many

then
turning

very
sweet
already
to
have
won
my
crown
and
pass
to

and
nevermore

thy

yet
would
i
stay
and
for
myself
i
own
to
stand
at
last
the
nearer
to
thy
songs
of
the
people
without
going
back
to
abstruse
speculations
on
the
origin
of
music
in
england
there
is
a
mania
in
our
century
for
discovering
the
of
everything
and
theorizing
on
it
long
before
a
sufficient
number
of
facts
has
been
collected
even
to
make
a
pedestal
for
the
most
modest
and
limited
theory
we
gather
from
the
mention
of
it
in
old
english
poems
and
books
on
ballads
and
songs
glees
and
catches
that
it
existed
in
a
very
creditable
form
at
least
eight
hundred
years
ago
indeed
there
was
national
and
popular
music
before
this
and
the
welsh
songs
the
oldest
of
all
point
far
back
to
a
legendary
past
as
the
source
of
their
being
the
first
foreign
song
that
mingled
with
the
rude
music
of
the
early
britons
was
doubtless
that
of
the
christian
missionaries
in
the
first
century
of
our
era
and
after
that
there
can
have
been
little
music
among
the
converted
britons
but
what
was
more
or
less
tinged
with
a
foreign
and
christian
element
we
know
too
that
at
various
times
foreign
monks
either
came
or
were
invited
to
the
different
kingdoms
in
england
to
teach
the
natives
the
ecclesiastical
chant
gardiner
in
his
of
says
that
the
invaders
came
from
all
parts
of
the
continent
our
language
and
music
became
a
motley
collection
of
sounds
and
words
unlike
that
of
any
other
people
and
though
we
have
gained
a
language
of
great
force
and
extent
yet
we
have
lost
our
primitive
music
as
not
a
single
song
remains
that
has
the
character
of
being
he
also
says
that
before
music
was
cultivated
as
an
art
england
in
common
with
other
countries
had
its
national
songs
but
that
these
with
the
people
who
sang
them
were
driven
by
the
conquerors
into
ireland
scotland
and
wales
this
assertion
is
rather
a
sweeping
one
and
the
recognized
formula
about
the
ancient
inhabitants
of
britain
being
crowded
into
certain
particular
districts
is
one
that
will
bear
modifying
and
correcting
the
british
anthropological
society
has
during
the
last
ten
years
made
interesting
researches
in
the
field
of
in
different
parts
of
england
and
an
accumulation
of
facts
has
gone
far
to
prove
the
permanence
of
some
gaelic
cymric
and
celtic
types
in
other
parts
exclusive
of
wales
and
cornwall
beddoe
and
mackintosh
have
published
the
result
of
their
observations
and
the
latter
concludes
that
considerable
portion
of
the
west
midland
and
southwestern
counties
are
scarcely
distinguishable
from
three
of
the
types
found
in
wales
namely
the
british
gaelic
and
cymrian
in
shropshire
and
ramifying
to
the
east
and
southeast
the
cymrian
type
may
be
found
in
great
numbers
though
not
in
many
parts
of
the
southwest
the
prevailing
type
among
the
working
classes
is
decidedly
north
devon
and
dorset
may
be
regarded
as
its
headquarters
in
south
then
again
the
district
along
the
borders
of
wales
especially
between
taunton
and
oswestry
and
as
far
east
as
bath
shows
a
population
more
naturally
intellectual
than
that
of
any
other
part
of
england
and
that
without
any
superiority
of
primary
education
to
account
for
it
the
people
are
what
might
be
called
anglicized
welsh
and
there
is
among
them
a
greater
taste
for
solid
knowledge
than
in
the
heart
of
england
lancashire
is
to
a
great
extent
scandinavian
and
also
somewhat
cymrian
as
we
have
seen
and
there
the
people
are
known
as
a
shrewd
hardy
race
thoughtful
and
fond
of
study
and
great
adepts
in
music
at
a
large
school
in
tiverton
devonshire
of
the
boys
presented
the
most
exaggerated
gaelic
physiognomy
while
at
another
near
chichester
the
girls
were
all
of
the
most
unmistakable
saxon
type
we
need
not
go
further
in
this
classification
and
only
introduced
it
to
show
that
massing
together
all
british
types
in
wales
and
cornwall
is
a
fallacy
such
as
all
hasty
generalizations
are
it
is
not
so
certain
therefore
that
there
exists
no
indigenous
element
in
the
old
songs
that
have
survived
though
in
many
an
altered
form
in
some
of
the
rural
districts
of
england
then
again
how
is
the
word
used
in
the
sense
of
indigenous
or
of
popular
or
of
exclusively
belonging
to
one
given
country
english
music
was
before
the
commonwealth
at
least
as
indigenous
as
the
english
language
as
that
gradually
grew
up
and
welded
itself
together
as
to
popularity
there
was
a
style
of
song
some
specimens
of
which
we
shall
give
which
was
known
and
used
by
the
poorest
and
humblest
and
a
style
too
far
removed
from
the
plebeian
though
it
may
have
been
rather
sentimental
then
glees
and
catches
are
though
of
no
very
great
antiquity
essentially
english
and
are
scarcely
known
in
any
other
country
if
stands
for
as
many
people
at
this
day
seem
to
take
for
granted
then
indeed
england
has
not
much
to
boast
of
that
music
is
born
rather
of
oppression
and
defeat
and
loves
to
commemorate
a
undying
devotion
to
their
own
race
laws
customs
and
rulers
irish
and
welsh
and
jacobite
songs
exhibit
that
style
best
though
only
the
first
of
the
three
have
any
present
significance
the
two
other
kinds
having
long
ago
become
more
valuable
for
their
intrinsic
or
historical
merit
than
for
their
political
meaning
certain
modern
english
songs
such
as
mariners
of
england
britannia
death
of
nelson
might
be
called
national
songs
in
the
political
sense
but
save
the
king
though
patriotic
and
loyal
is
thoroughly
german
in
style
and
composition
and
therefore
hardly
deserves
the
title
national
the
welsh
have
kept
their
musical
taste
pure
mackintosh
in
his
paper
on
the
anthropology
of
england
and
says
of
the
quiet
and
thoughtful
villagers
of
glan
ogwen
near
the
great
penrhyn
slate
quarries
that
appreciation
of
the
compositions
of
handel
and
other
great
musicians
is
remarkable
and
they
perform
the
most
difficult
oratorios
with
a
precision
of
time
and
intonation
unknown
in
any
part
of
england
except
the
west
riding
of
yorkshire
lancashire
worcester
gloucester
and
the
three
latter
are
towns
where
the
musical
festivals
are
so
frequent
that
the
taste
of
the
people
can
not
help
being
educated
up
to
a
good
standard
hereford
too
is
very
near
the
welsh
border
musical
ear
of
the
welsh
is
extremely
accurate
i
was
once
present
in
a
village
church
belonging
to
the
late
dean
of
bangor
when
the
choir
sang
an
anthem
composed
by
their
leader
and
repeated
an
unaccompanied
five
or
six
times
without
the
slightest
lowering
of
pitch
the
works
of
handel
haydn
beethoven
and
mozart
are
republished
with
welsh
words
at
ruthin
and
several
other
towns
and
their
circulation
is
almost
incredible
at
book
and
music
shops
of
a
rank
where
in
england
negro
melodies
would
form
the
staple
compositions
handel
is
the
great
favorite
and
such
tunes
as
goes
the
would
not
be
tolerated
the
native
airs
are
in
general
very
elegant
and
melodious
some
of
them
composed
long
before
handel
are
in
the
handelian
style
others
are
remarkably
similar
to
some
of
compositions
the
less
classical
welsh
airs
in
time
such
as
are
well
known
those
in
time
are
often
characterized
by
a
sudden
stop
in
the
middle
or
at
the
close
of
a
measure
and
a
repetition
of
pathetic
slides
or
much
of
this
eulogium
might
be
equally
applied
to
the
people
of
lancashire
especially
the
men
who
know
the
great
oratorios
by
heart
and
sing
the
choruses
faultlessly
among
themselves
not
only
at
large
gatherings
but
in
casual
reunions
whenever
three
or
four
happen
to
meet
their
too
in
glees
both
ancient
and
modern
is
admirable
and
they
have
scarcely
any
taste
for
the
low
songs
which
are
only
too
popular
in
many
parts
of
england
the
songs
of
chivalry
were
another
graft
on
the
stock
of
english
music
and
the
honor
paid
to
the
bards
and
minstrels
was
a
mingling
of
the
love
of
a
national
institution
at
least
as
old
as
the
druids
some
say
much
older
and
of
the
enthusiasm
produced
by
the
metrical
relation
of
heroic
feats
of
arms
the
crusades
gave
a
great
impulse
to
the
songs
while
the
ancient
british
custom
of
commemorating
the
national
history
by
the
oral
tradition
and
the
music
of
the
harpers
seemed
to
merge
into
and
strengthen
the
new
order
of
minstrels
long
before
the
bagpipe
became
the
peculiar
almost
national
instrument
of
scotland
the
harp
held
that
position
as
it
has
not
yet
ceased
to
do
in
ireland
and
wales
the
oldest
harp
now
in
great
britain
is
an
irish
one
which
was
already
old
in
it
is
now
in
the
museum
of
trinity
college
dublin
these
ancient
instruments
were
very
different
from
the
modern
ones
on
which
our
grandmothers
used
to
display
their
skill
before
the
pianoforte
became
to
its
detriment
the
fashionable
instrument
for
young
ladies
and
even
now
the
irish
and
welsh
harps
are
made
exactly
on
the
old
models
and
have
no
pedals
but
the
use
of
the
harp
was
not
confined
to
the
welsh
and
in
the
reign
of
king
john
in
the
xiith
century
on
the
occasion
of
an
attack
made
on
the
old
town
of
chester
by
the
welsh
during
the
great
yearly
fair
it
is
recorded
in
the
town
annals
that
the
commandant
assembled
all
the
minstrels
who
had
come
to
the
place
upon
that
occasion
and
marched
them
in
the
night
with
their
instruments
playing
against
the
enemy
who
upon
hearing
so
vast
a
sound
were
filled
with
such
terror
and
surprise
that
they
instantly
fled
in
memory
of
this
famous
exploit
no
doubt
suggested
by
the
biblical
narrative
of
successful
stratagem
a
meeting
of
minstrels
is
annually
kept
up
to
this
day
with
one
of
the
dutton
family
at
their
head
to
whom
certain
privileges
are
granted
in
the
reign
of
henry
the
minstrels
were
formed
into
corporate
bodies
and
enjoyed
certain
immunities
in
various
parts
of
the
kingdom
gardiner
says
that
most
accomplished
became
the
companions
and
favorites
of
kings
and
attended
the
court
in
all
its
perhaps
we
may
refer
the
still
extant
office
of
to
this
custom
of
retaining
a
court
minstrel
near
the
person
of
the
sovereign
in
the
time
of
elizabeth
the
profession
of
a
harper
had
become
a
degraded
one
only
embraced
by
idle
low
and
dissolute
characters
and
so
it
has
remained
ever
since
through
the
various
stages
of
and
fiddler
in
which
the
memory
of
the
once
noble
office
has
been
merged
or
lost
in
scotland
the
piper
a
personage
of
importance
has
taken
the
place
of
the
harper
since
the
time
of
mary
queen
of
scots
who
introduced
the
pipes
from
france
but
in
wales
the
minstrel
with
his
harp
upheld
his
respectability
much
longer
and
even
now
most
of
the
old
families
jealous
and
proud
of
their
national
customs
retain
their
bard
as
an
officer
of
the
household
the
writer
has
seen
and
heard
one
of
these
ancient
minstrels
in
the
service
of
a
family
living
near
llanarth
the
mistress
a
widow
making
it
her
special
business
to
promote
the
keeping
up
of
all
old
national
customs
she
was
an
excellent
farmer
too
and
had
a
pet
breed
of
small
black
welsh
sheep
whose
wool
she
prepared
for
the
loom
herself
and
with
which
she
clothed
her
family
and
household
in
the
neighboring
town
she
had
got
up
an
annual
competition
of
harpers
and
choirs
for
the
performance
of
welsh
music
exclusively
the
concert
was
always
the
occasion
of
a
regular
country
festivity
ending
with
a
ball
and
medals
and
other
prizes
were
given
by
her
own
hand
to
the
best
instrumental
and
vocal
artists
in
a
description
is
given
of
the
dress
and
appearance
of
a
mediæval
bard
as
personated
at
a
pageant
given
at
kenilworth
in
honor
of
queen
elizabeth
the
glory
of
the
brotherhood
was
already
so
much
a
thing
of
the
past
that
it
was
thought
worth
while
to
introduce
this
figure
into
a
mock
procession
this
very
circumstance
is
enough
to
mark
the
decline
of
the
art
in
those
days

it

that
this

was
a

favorite
with
the
english
people
at
a
very
early
period
and
was
indebted
to
them
for
many
improvements

in

rather
preceded

that

of

xvith
centuries
ritson
it
is
true
in
his
songs
from
the
time
of
king
henry
iii
to
the
disputes
this
but
hawkins
is
of
the
same
opinion
as
burney
stafford
smith
at
the
end
of
the
last
century
made
a
collection
of
old
english
songs
written
in
score
for
three
or
four
voices
but
though
the
oldest
music
to
such
songs
is
scarcely
intelligible
the
number
collected
proves
how
popular
that
sort
of
music
was
in
early
times
perhaps
the
illegibility
of
the
music
is
due
to
the
old
notation
in
use
before
the
perfected
stave
of
four
lines
became
general
the
pneumatic
notation
supposed
by
coussemaker
schubiger
ambros
and
other
writers
on
music
to
have
been
developed
out
of
the
system
of
accents
of
speech
represented
by
signs
such
as
are
still
used
in
french
landini
an
italian
writer
of
the
xvth
century
in
his
on

of
most
excellent
as
coming
from
england
to
italy
to
hear
and
study
under
antonio
a
name
denoting
his
profession
while
another
writer
the
of
the
royal
chapel
of
ferdinand
king
of
naples
mentions
the
excellence
of
the
english
vocal
music
in
parts
and
even
incorrectly
calls
john
of
dunstable
a
musician
of
the
middle
of
the
xvth
century
the
of
one
of
the
oldest
compositions
of
this
kind
is
a
manuscript
score
in
the
british
museum
a
canon
in
unison
for
four
voices
with
the
addition
of
two
more
voices
for
the
as
it
is
called
which
is
a
kind
of
ground
and
is
the
basis
of
the
harmony
the
words
partially
modernized
are
as
follows
they
are
much
older
than
the

burney
says
of
this
song
that
the
modulation
is
monotonous
but
that
the
chief
merit
lies
in
airy
pastoral
correspondence
of
the
melody
with
the
a
merit
which
many
modern
compositions
of
the
type
are
very
far
from
possessing
under
the
tudors
music
made
rapid
strides
robert
fairfax
was
well
known
as
a
composer
in
those
days
and
a
collection
of
old
english
songs
with
their
music
often
in
parts
made
by
him
has
been
preserved
to
this
day
besides
himself
such
writers
as
cornyshe
syr
thomas
phelyppes
davy
brown
banister
tudor
turges
sheryngham
and
william
of

are
represented
of
these
cornyshe
was
the
best
and
purcell
two
hundred
years
later
imitated
much
of
his
rondeau
style
most
of
these
composers
being
entirely
secular
henry
viii
himself
wrote
music
for
two
masses
and
had
them
sung
in
his
chapel
and
to
be
able
to
take
a
part
in
madrigals
and
sing
at
sight
in
any
piece
of
concerted
music
was
reckoned
a
part
of
a
education
in
those
days
the
invention
of
printing
gave
a
great
impulse
to
and
composing
though
for
some
time
after
the
words
were
printed
the
music
was
probably
still
copied
by
hand
over
the
words
for
the
printing
of
notes
was
of
course
a
further
and
subsequent
development
of
the
new
art
a
musician
and
poet
of
the
name
of
gray
became
a
favorite
of
henry
viii
and
of
the
protector
somerset
making
certain
merry
ballades
whereof
one
chiefly
was
hunt
is
up
the
hunt
is
popular
species
of
harmony
says
ritson
in
this
reign
it
was
called
mirth
or
songs
that
monarch
being
a
great
admirer
of
vocal
music
is
a
corruption
of
songs
from
their
being
generally
for
three
very
few
songs
were
written
for
one
voice
ballads
were
very
popular
and
formed
one
of
the
great
attractions
at
fairs
an
old
pamphlet
published
in
the
reign
of
elizabeth
mentions
with
astonishment
that
dick
and
wat
got
twenty
shillings
a
day
by
singing
at
braintree
fair
in
essex
it
does
seem
a
good
deal
considering
that
the
sum
was
equal
to
five
pounds
of
the
present
money
which
again
is
equivalent
to
about
thirty
dollars
currency
these
wandering
singers
the
lowly
successors
of
the
proud
minstrels
were
in
their
way
quite
as
successful
but
what
is
more
wonderful
their
songs
were
for
the
most
part
neither
coarse
nor
vulgar
good
poets
wrote
for
music
in
those
days
as
a
general
rule
it
is
only
rhymers
who
avowedly
write
that
their
words
may
be
set
to
music
as
pedlers
mounted
benches
and
to
harangue
the
people
and
thus
gained
the
now
name
of
mountebanks
so
too
did
these
singers
call
over
their
songs
and
sing
those
chosen
by
their
audience
and
they
are
frequently
called
by
the
writers
of
those
times
an
italian
compound
of
to
sing
and
benches
among
the
headings
given
of
these
popular
songs
are
the
following
three
ravens
a
a
bank
as
i
woe
is
me
merry
men
we
now
he
is
dead
and
robin
lend
me
thy
lass
upon
a
is
dead
and
gone
lady
etc
there
is
a
quaint
grace
and
sadness
about
the
titles
which
speaks
well
for
the
manners
of
those
who
listened
and
applauded
popular
taste
has
certainly
degenerated
in
many
parts
of
england
for
such
titles
would
only
provoke
a
sneer
among
an
average
london
or
midland
county
audience
of
the
lower
classes
gardiner
says
most
ancient
of
our
english
songs
are
of
a
grave
cast
and
commonly
written
in
the
key
of
g
among
the
composers
of
the
reigns
of
elizabeth
and
james
was
birde
who
wrote
a
still
popular
canon
on
the
latin
words
nobis
domine
and
set
to
music
the
celebrated
song
ascribed
to
sir
edward
dyer
a
friend
of
sir
philip
sidney
mind
to
me
a
kingdom
scholar
morley
produced
a
great
number
of
canzonets
or
short
songs
for
three
or
more
voices
and
ford
who
was
an
original
genius
published
some
pieces
for
four
voices
with
an
accompaniment
for
lutes
and
viols
besides
other
pieces
especially
catches
of
an
humorous
character
george
kirbye
was
another
canzonet
composer
and
thomas
weelkes
has
been
immortalized
by
the
which
threw
him
in
way
so
that
the
latter
often
wrote
words
for
his
music
yet
doubtless
the
fame
of
the
one
as
that
of
the
other
was
chiefly
posthumous
and
poet
and
musician
on
a
par
in
those
days
may
have
starved
in
company
unknowing
that
a
of
theirs
would
fetch
its
weight
in
gold
a
hundred
years
after
they
were
in
their
graves
musical
reputation
of
england
says
a
writer
in
an
old
review
of
mainly
rest
on
the
songs
in
parts
of
the
period
between
and
and
gardiner
says
we
can
set
up
any
claim
to
originality
it
is
in
our
glees
and
the
gleemen
who
were
at
first
a
class
of
the
minstrels
are
supposed
to
have
been
the
first
who
performed
vocal
music
in
parts
according
to
set
rules
and
by
notes
though
the
custom
must
have
existed
long
before
it
was
thus
technically
sanctioned
the
earliest
pieces
of
the
kind
are
by
the
madrigal
writers
and
were
perhaps
founded
upon
the
taste
of
the
italian
school
but
there
soon
grew
up
a
distinction
sufficient
to
mark
english
as
a
separate
species
of
the
art
it
is
said
that
did
not
become
generally
popular
till
about
the
year
when
glees
formed
a
prominent
part
of
the
private
concerts
of
the
nobility
but
their
being
adopted
into
fashionable
circles
only
at
that
date
is
scarcely
a
proof
of
their
late
origin
the
canzonets
for
three
or
four
voices
must
have
been
closely
allied
to
glees
and
a
family
likeness
existed
between
these
and
the
madrigals
for
four
or
five
voices
the
ballets
or
for
five
and
the
songs
for
six
and
seven
parts
which
are
so
prodigally
mentioned
in
a
list
of
works
by
morley
within
the
short
space
of
only
four
years
to
the
number
of
these
songs
proves
their
wonderful
popularity
and
we
incline
to
think
with
the
writer
we
have
quoted
that
the
english
in
the
catches
and
glees
the
works
of
the
composers
of
the
days
of
elizabeth
and
james
and
those
of
purcell
tallis
croft
bull
blow
boyce
at
a
later
period
possess
a
music
essentially
national
and
original
not
imitative
as
is
the
modern
english
school
and
not
more
indebted
to
foreign
sources
than
any
other
progressive
and
liberal
art
is
to
the
lessons
given
it
by
its
practisers
in
other
civilized
communities
for
if
is
to
mean
isolated
and
petrified
by
all
means
let
us
forswear
nationalism
songs
are
scattered
throughout
his
works
and
were
evidently
written
for
music
both
old
and
new
composers
have
set
them
to
music
and
of
the
latter
none
so
happily
as
bishop
weelkes
and
john
dowland
his
contemporaries
and
friends
the
latter
the
composer
of
favorite
song
not
his
own
sweet
love
often
wrote
music
for
his
words
in
his
plays
shakspere
has
introduced
many
fragments
of
songs
and
ballads
but
ritson
says
of
him
admirable
writer
composed
the
most
beautiful
and
excellent
songs
which
no
one
so
far
as
we
know
can
be
said
to
have
done
before
him
nor
has
any
one
excelled
him
this
statement
is
qualified
by
an
exception
in
favor
of
marlowe
a
predecessor
of
shakspere
and
the
author
of
the
shepherd
to
his
and
besides
it
means
that
he
was
the
first
great
poet
among
the
who
in
comparison
with
him
might
be
called
mere
love
for
the
old
simple
touching
music
of
his
native
land
shown
on
many
occasions
throughout
his
works
is
most
exquisitely
expressed
in
the
following
passage
from
good
cesario
but
that
piece
of
song
that
old
and
antique
song
we
had
last
night
methought
it
did
relieve
my
passion
much
more
than
light
airs
and
recollected
terms
of
these
most
brisk
and
times
o
fellow
come
the
song
we
had
last
night
mark
it
cesario
it
is
old
and
plain
the
spinsters
and
the
knitters
in
the
sun
and
the
free
maids
that
weave
their
thread
with
bones
do
use
to
chant
it
it
is
silly
sooth
and
dallies
with
the
innocence
of
love
like
the
old
though
plays
were
marked
with
the
coarseness
of
speech
common
in
his
time
and
therefore
not
as
some
have
thought
chargeable
to
him
in
particular
his
songs
on
the
contrary
are
of
singular
daintiness
they
are
too
well
known
to
be
quoted
here
but
they
breathe
the
very
spirit
of
music
being
evidently
intended
to
be
sung
and
popularly
known
the
chorus
or
rather
refrain
of
one
beginning
blow
thou
winter
wind
runs
thus

heigh
ho

jolly
the
to
is
lovely
chaste
and
delicate
in
speech
as
it
is
playful
in
form
and
the
fairy
song
hill
over
dale
is
like
the
song
of
a
chorus
of
animated
flowers
the
description
of

is
very
poetic

a
satirical
poem
in
which
he
complains
that
madrigals
and
ballads
were
to
the
wheel
and
sung
unto
the
that
is
by
maids
spinning
and
milking
or
fetching
water
and
lord
surrey
in
one
of
his
poems
says
not
satirically
however
maids
when
they
do
sit
and
spin
they
sing
a
now
we
gather
what
was
the
style
of
these
songs
of
peasant
girls
and
laborers
from
the
writings
of
good
old
izaak
walton
who
mentions
as
a
common
occurrence
that
he
often
met
in
the
fields
bordering
the
river
lee
a
handsome
milkmaid
who
sang
like
a
nightingale
her
voice
being
good
and
the
ditties
fitted
for
it
sang
the
smooth
song
which
was
made
by
kit
marlowe
now
at
least
fifty
years
ago
and
the
mother
sang
the
answer
to
it
which
was
made
by
sir
walter
raleigh
in
his
younger
they
were
poetry
but
choicely
good
i
think
much
better
than
that
now
in
fashion
in
this
critical
he
wrote
in
the
reign
of
charles
and
already
deplored
the
influx
of
more
pretentious
songs
but
those
he
mentions
with
such
commendation
were
the
famous
shepherd
to
his
and
the
song
beginning
all
the
world
and
love
were
young
two
exquisite
lyrics
of
an
elegance
much
above
what
is
now
termed
the
taste
of
the
vulgar
izaak
walton
was
as
fond
of
music
as
of
angling
and
quotes
many
of
the
popular
songs
of
his
day
he
was
a
quiet
man
and
only
describes
the
pastimes
of
humble
life
he
used
to
rest
from
his
labors
in
an
and
a
room
where
he
and
his
and
sometimes
the
milkmaid
whiled
away
the
evenings
by
singing
ballads
and
duets
any
casual
was
expected
to
take
his
part
and
among
the
music
mentioned
as
common
in
these
gatherings
are
numbers
of
or
as
we
should
say
catches
the
music
of

of
his
favorite

also
mentioned
by

popular
among

here
is
another
instance
of
the
power
of
song
over
the
peasantry

the
early
part

century

occasion
of

on

vicar
of

obscure
country
parish
who
entreated
that
her
majesty
would
be
pleased
to
listen
to
a
concert
performed
by
his
people
the
queen
signified
her
assent
there
rose
out
of
the
ravine
a
handsome
company
dressed
as
druids
and
as
british
shepherds
and
shepherdesses
who
sang
a
greeting
beginning
with
these
words
to
a
melody
which
greatly
pleased
the
musical
taste
of
her
majesty
oh
shine
thou
sacred
star
on
seely
shepherd
swains
we
should
suppose
from
the
commencing
words
that
this
poem
had
originally
been
a
nativity
hymn
pertaining
to
the
ancient
church
and
it
is
possible
that
the
melody
might
be
traced
to
the
same
the
music
the
voices
and
the
romantic
dresses
so
well
corresponding
with
the
mysterious
spot
where
this
pastoral
concert
was
stationed
greatly
captivated
the
imagination
of
the
anne
of
denmark
admired
and
patronized

genius
of
ben
jonson
the
writer
of
several
musical
masques
often
performed
at
court
by
the
queen
and
her
noble
attendants
the
really
classical
time
of
english
poetry
and
music
was
before
the
commonwealth
and
popular
music
certainly
received
a
blow
during
the
puritan
rule
songs
and
ballads
were
forbidden
as
profane
and
in
cromwell
enacted
that
any
of
the
persons
commonly
called
fiddlers
or
minstrels
shall
at
any
time
be
taken
playing
fiddling
and
making
music
in
any
inn
or
tavern
or
shall
be
taken
proffering
themselves
or
designing
or
entreating
any
to
hear
them
play
or
make
music
in
any
of
the
places
aforesaid
they
should
be
and
declared
to
be
rogues
vagabonds
and
sturdy
fines
and
imprisonments
were
often
the
penalties
attached
to
a
disregard
of
these
ordinances
but
this
opposition
only
turned
the
course
of
popular
song
into
political
channels
and
it
became
a
point
of
honor
among
the
royalists
to
listen
to
applaud
and
protect
the
veriest
scamp
who
called
himself
a
minstrel
songs
were
written
with
no
poetical
merit
but
full
of
political
allusions
bitter
taunts
and
sneers
and
it
was
the
delight
of
the
cavaliers
to
sing
these
doggerel
rhymes
and
make
the
wandering
fiddlers
sing
them
many
a
brawl
owed
its
origin
to
this
even
certain
tunes
without
any
words
were
considered
as
identified
with
political
principle
and
led
to
dangerous
ebullitions
of
feeling
or
kept
alive
party
prejudices
in
those
who
heard
them
popular
music
has
always
been
a
powerful
engine
for
good
or
bad
in
a
political
sense
half
the
loyalty
of
the
jacobites
of
scotland
in
the
xviiith
century
was
due
to
inflammatory
songs
lyrics
fired
german
patriotism
against
napoleon
and
there
has
never
been
a
party
of
any
kind
that
did
not
speedily
adopt
some
representative
melody
to
fan
the
ardor
of
its
adherents
but
if
music
and
poetry
were
proscribed
by
the
puritans
a
worse
excess
was
fostered
by
the
immoral
reign
of
charles
ii
the
restoration
polluted
the
stream
which
the
commonwealth
had
attempted
to
dam
up
just
as
in
a
spirit
of
bravado
and
contradiction
the
cavaliers
had
ostentatiously
made
cursing
and
swearing
a
badge
of
their
party
to
spite
the
sanctimoniousness
of
the
roundheads
so
they
affected
to
oppose
to
the
roaring
and
immodest
songs
ritson
says
that
charles
ii
tried
his
hand
at
and
quotes
a
piece
by
him
beginning
pass
all
my
hours
in
a
shady
old
by
no
means
remarkable
for
poetical
merit
says
the
critic
has
certainly
enough
for
the
composition
of
a
molière
was
not
more
severe
on
the
attempts
of
louis
xiv
but
though
the
general
spirit
of
the
age
was
licentious
many
good
songs
were
still
written
sedley
rochester
dorset
sheffield
and
others
wrote
unexceptionable
ones
and
the
great
dryden
flourished
in
this
reign
one
of
his
odes
day
is
thoroughly
musical
in
its
rhythm
the
refrains
at
the
end
of
each
stanza
having
the
ring
of
some
of
the
old
german
minnesongs
of
the
xiith
and
xiiith
centuries
but
his
verses
were
scarcely
simple
or
flowing
enough
to
become
popular
in
the
widest
sense
which
honor
rather
belonged
to
the
less
celebrated
poets
of
his
day
lord
dorset
for
instance
was
the
author
of
a
said
to
have
been
written
the
night
before
an
engagement
with
the
dutch
in
and
which
from
its
admirable
ease
flow
and
tenderness
became
at
once
popular
with
all
classes
the
circumstances
under
which
it
was
supposed
to
be
written
had
no
doubt
something
to
do
with
its
popularity
but
johnson
says
any
splendid
story
is
wholly
true
i
have
heard
from
the
late
earl
of
orrery
who
was
likely
to
have
good
hereditary
intelligence
that
lord
dorset
had
been
a
week
employed
upon
it
and
only
retouched
or
finished
it
on
the
memorable
evening
but
even
this
whatever
it
may
subtract
from
his
facility
leaves
him
his
the
anonymous
writer
to
whom
we
have
referred
tells
us
that
shorter
pieces
of
most
of
the
poets
of
the
time
of
charles
ii
had
a
rhythm
and
cadence
particularly
well
suited
to
music
they
were
in
short
what
the
italians
call
or
fit
to
be
in
the
succeeding
reigns
with
the
growth
of
our
literature
there
was
a
considerable
increase
in
most
of
our
poets
of
eminence
and
some
who
had
no
eminence
except
what
they
obtained
in
that
way
devoting
themselves
occasionally
to
the
composition
of
lyrical
pieces
prior
rowe
steele
philips
parnell
gay
and
others
contributed
a
stock
which
might
advantageously
be
referred
to
by
the
composers
of
our
own
prior
was
a
friend
and
of
lord
dorset
who
sent
him
to
cambridge
and
paid
for
his
education
there
parnell
was
an
irishman
his
to
is
a
sort
of
counterpart
to
the
old
song

to
me
a
kingdom
lasting
peace

this
world
itself
if
thou
art
here
is
once
again
with
eden
blest
and
man
contains
it
in
his
gay
the
elegant
the
humorous
and
the
pathetic
shows
to
most
advantage
in
this
group
he
it
was
who
wrote
the
famous
ballad
susan
and
many
others
which
though
less
known
at
present
are
equally
admirable
one
of
them
was
afterwards
set
to
music
by
handel
and
later
on
by
jackson
of
exeter
but
music
did
not
keep
pace
with
poetry
and
though
purcell
carey
and
one
or
two
other
composers
flourished
in
the
latter
part
of
the
xviith
and
beginning
of
the
xviiith
centuries
they
kept
mostly
to
sacred
music
and
the
new
songs
of
the
day
were
generally
set
to
old
tunes
a
collection
of
songs
could
not
boast
of
a
single
air
composed
for
the
purpose
the
music
was
all
old
but
the
stage
says
burney
ruined
the
simplicity
of
the
old
airs
as
it
invariably
does
all
music
adapted
to
dramatic
purposes
indeed
we
in
our
own
day
sometimes
have
the
opportunity
of
verifying
this
fact
when
old
airs
or
ballads
are
introduced
into
operas
to
which
they
are
unfitted
the
rose
of
put
into
the
opera
of
is
an
instance
in
point
but
worse
than
that
the
writer
once
heard
sweet
sung
during
the
scene
in
the
de
adelina
patti
was
the
and
any
one
who
has
seen
and
heard
her
can
imagine
the
contrast
between
the
simple
pathetic
air
and
words
and
the
kittenish
coquettish
style
of
the
singer
add
to
this
the
costume
of
a
spanish
and
the
stage
finery
of
boudoir
not
to
mention
the
absurd
anachronism
involved
in
a
girl
of
the
xviith
century
singing
touching
song
of
course
the
audience
applauded
vigorously
for
an
english
audience
at
the
opera
goes
into
action
in
the
spirit
of
words
expects
every
man
to
do
his
duty
and
the
incongruousness
of
the
scene
never
troubles
its
mind
carey
tried
to
stem
the
downfall
of
really
good
popular
music
by
writing
both
the
words
and
music
of
the
ballad
of
in
our
alley
which
attained
a
popularity
using
the
word
in
its
proper
sense
that
it
has
never
lost
and
never
will
lose
the
song
was
soon
known
from
one
end
of
the
country
to
the
other
and
like
the
old
songs
was
the
furrowed
and
to
the
wheel
and
sung
unto
the
addison
was
no
less
fond
of
it
than
the
common
people
but
the
song
was
an
exception
in
its
time
and
the
poetry
of
the
day
never
again
made
its
way
among
the
great
body
of
the
people
as
it
had
done
under
the
tudors
and
the
early
stuarts
music
and
poetry
both
grew
artificial
under
the
hanoverian
dynasty
and
the
mannerisms
and
affectations
of
rhymers
and
musical
critics
were
sharply
satirized
by
pope
and
swift
in
the
reign
of
queen
anne
the
italian
opera
was
introduced
into
london
and
the
silly
rage
for
foreign
music
it
was
foreign
soon
worked
its
way
among
all
classes
handel
brought
about
the
first
salutary
return
to
natural
and
simple
musical
expression
and
setting
many
national
and
pastoral
pieces
to
music
diffused
the
taste
for
good
music
through
the
intermediate
orders
of
the
people
especially
the
country
gentry
but
the
masses
still
clung
to
interminable
ballads
with
monotonous
tunes
and
no
individuality
either
of
sense
or
of
form
although
england
could
boast
of
some
good
native
composers
and
poets
in
the
xviiith
century
for
instance
among
the
former
boyce
arne
linley
jackson
shield
arnold
still
no
good
music
penetrated
into
the
lower
strata
of
society
for
these
musicians
mostly
confined
themselves
to
pieces
of
greater
pretension
than
anything
which
was
likely
to
become
popular
wales
and
the
north
of
england
still
kept
up
a
better
standard
but
the
general
taste
of
the
nation
was
decidedly
vitiated
broke
the
spell
and
reached
the
heart
of
the
people
but
this
was
rather
a
momentary
flash
than
a
permanent
resurrection
of
good
taste
and
discernment
the
custom
of
writing
the
majority
of
songs
for
one
voice
we
think
had
had
much
to
do
with
destroying
the
genuine
love
of
music
among
the
people
it
seemed
to
shift
the
burden
of
entertainment
upon
one
member
of
a
social
gathering
instead
of
assuming
that
music
was
the
welcome
occupation
and
pastime
of
the
greater
number
and
besides
this
it
no
doubt
fostered
an
undue
rage
for
melody
or
as
it
is
vulgarly
called
we
have
often
had
occasion
to
notice
how
bald
and
meagre
trivial
indeed
a
mere
thread
of
melody
can
sound
when
sung
by
one
voice
which
if
sung
in
parts
acquires
a
majestic
and
full
tone
the
fashion
of
which
obtains
so
much
in
our
day
has
another
disadvantage
it
encourages
affectation
and
in
the
singer
the
is
very
apt
to
arrogate
to
him
or
herself
the
merit
and
effect
of
the
piece
to
think
more
of
the
individual
performance
than
of
the
music
performed
and
to
spoil
a
good
piece
by
interpolating
runs
and
shakes
to
show
off
his
or
her
powers
of
vocal
gymnastics
all
this
was
impossible
in
the
old
where
attention
and
precision
were
indispensable
there
are
hopeful
indications
at
present
that
england
is
not
utterly
sunk
into
musical
indifference
but
strange
to
say
wherever
the
good
leaven
work
it
does
so
from
below
upwards
the
lower
classes
in
the
north
of
england
have
mainly
given
the
impulse
the
higher
are
still
on
the
whole
superficial
in
their
tastes
and
trivial
and
mediocre
in
their
performances
even
as
far
back
as
the
writer
in
the
already
quoted
gives
an
interesting
account
of
a
surprise
he
met
with
at
a
small
village
in
sussex
this
be
it
remembered
is
an
almost
exclusively
saxon
district
of
the
country
being
tired
of
the
solitude
of
the
little
inn
and
the
dulness
of
a
country
newspaper
he
walked
down
the
street
of
the
village
and
in
so
doing
was
brought
to
a
pause
before
a
small
cottage
nowise
distinguished
from
the
other
humble
homesteads
of
the
place
from
which
proceeded
sounds
of
sweet
music
the
performance
within
consisted
not
of
voices
but
of
instruments
and
the
piece
was
one
of
great
pathos
and
beauty
and
not
devoid
of
musical
difficulty
when
it
was
finished
and
the
performers
had
rested
a
few
seconds
they
executed
a
german
quartet
of
some
pretensions
in
very
good
style
this
was
followed
by
variations
on
a
popular
air
by
stephen
storace
which
they
played
in
excellent
time
and
with
considerable
elegance
and
expression
several
other
pieces
chosen
with
equal
good
taste
succeeded
this
and
the
stranger
enjoyed
a
musical
treat
where
he
little
expected
one
on
making
inquiries
at
the
inn
he
found
that
the
performers
were
all
young
men
of
the
village
humble
mechanics
and
agricultural
laborers
who
for
some
considerable
time
had
been
in
the
habit
of
meeting
at
each
houses
in
the
evening
and
playing
and
practising
together
the
taste
had
originated
with
a
young
man
of
the
place
who
had
acquired
a
little
knowledge
of
music
at
brighton
he
had
taught
some
of
his
comrades
and
by
degrees
they
had
so
increased
in
number
and
improved
in
the
art
that
now
to
use
the
words
of
the
informant
were
eight
or
ten
that
could
play
by
book
and
in
at
that
time
and
in
that
part
of
the
country
this
was
an
unusual
and
remarkable
proof
of
refinement
and
good
taste
but
at
present
though
still
the
exception
it
is
no
longer
quite
so
rare
to
find
uneducated
people
able
to
a
certain
degree
to
appreciate
good
music
much
has
been
written
to
vindicate
english
musical
taste
within
the
last
thirty
or
forty
years
but
still
the
fact
can
scarcely
be
overlooked
that
notwithstanding
all
efforts
to
the
contrary
the
standard
of
taste
among
the
masses
is
lower
than
it
was
in
tudor
days
every
one
is
familiar
with
the
choral
unions
the
the
choir
and
methods
which
all
go
far
to
raise
the
taste
of
the
people
and
enlist
the
vocal
powers
of
many
who
otherwise
would
have
been
tempted
to
leave
singing
to
the
and
other
as
the
only
thing
those
benighted
individuals
could
be
good
for
there
is
as
there
has
been
for
many
generations
the
chapel
royal
a
sort
of
informal
school
of
music
there
is
the
academy
of
music
there
are
and
popular
musical
festivals
every
year
in
the
various
cathedrals
oratorios
in
exeter
hall
and
there
soon
will
be
a
school
of
music
which
is
to
be
a
climax
in
musical
education
the
pride
of
the
representative
bodies
of
wealthy
and
noble
england
for
princes
and
corporations
have
vied
with
each
other
in
founding
scholarships
but
with
all
this
the
palmy
days
of
the
tudors
are
dead
and
gone
beyond
the
power
of
man
to
galvanize
them
into
new
activity
true
every
young
woman
plays
the
pianoforte
you
see
that
instrument
in
the
best
parlor
and
the
but
the
sort
of
music
played
upon
it
is
trivial
and
foreign
an
exotic
in
the
life
of
the
performer
a
accomplishment
not
a
labor
of
love
you
can
hear
star
and
sweet
home
and
sung
one
after
the
other
with
the
same
expression
the
same
the
same
stolidity
or
the
same
affected
languor
and
you
will
perceive
that
though
the
singer
may
them
she
neither
feels
nor
understands
them
melodies
too
you
hear
murdered
and
slurred
over
anyhow
but
both
the
delicacy
of
the
poetry
and
the
pathos
of
the
music
are
a
to
the
performer
but
though
a
few
songs
by
good
writers
are
popular
in
the
middle
classes
for
instance
and
into
the
garden
maud
the
immortal
and
almost
unspoilable
sweet
yet
there
is
also
a
dark
side
to
the
picture
in
the
prevalence
of
comic
songs
low
slangy
ballads
sham
negro
melodies
utterly
unlike
the
real
old
pathetic
and
other
degrading
entertainments
classed
under
the
title
of
the
higher
classes
give
little
countenance
or
aid
to
the
upward
movement
in
music
and
still
look
upon
the
art
as
an
adjunct
of
fashion
with
such
disadvantages
it
is
a
wonder
that
england
has
struggled
back
into
the
ranks
of
at
all
even
though
as
yet
she
can
take
but
a
subordinate
place
among
them
pious
pictures
a
great
deterioration
having
been
observable
for
some
time
past
in
the
multitudinous
little
pictures
published
in
paris
ostensibly
with
a
religious
object
some
of
the
more
thoughtful
writers
in
catholic
periodicals
have
on
several
recent
occasions
earnestly
protested
against
the
form
these
representations
are
taking
their
remonstrances
are
however
as
yet
unsuccessful
the
continues
to
be
produced
on
an
increasing
scale
and
is
daily
transmitted
in
immense
quantities
not
only
to
the
farthest
extremities
of
the
territory
but
far
beyond
especially
to
england
and
america
to
ruin

and

the

not
to

already
turned
their
attention
to
this
unhealthy
state
of
things
in
what
may
be
called
pictorial
literature
for

and
efforts
are
being
made
in
the
higher
regions
of

to
arrest
its
deterioration

passed
on

interpretations
of
religious
truths

render
them
ridiculous

of
unbelievers

the
taste
of
the
the

this

has
not
been
without
effect
there
appears
in
the
from
the

of
léon

the
author
of
several
pious
and
learned
works
a
letter
certain

addressed

the
absurdity
of
these
silly
compositions
is
attacked

this
letter
with
an
entreaty
to
its

to

preached
by
the
eminent
writer
a
crusade
the
opportuneness
of
which
must
be
only
too
evident
to
every
thoughtful
and
religious
mind
léon
gautier
writes
as
follows
you
have
requested
me
dear
friend
to
purchase
for
you
a
of
little
pictures
for
distribution
among
your
poor
and
their
as
to
the
selection
of
these
pictures
i
must
own
myself
greatly
perplexed
and
must
beg
to
submit
to
you
very
humbly
my
difficulties
and
not
only
my
difficulties
but
also
my
distress
and
to
say
the
truth
my
indignation
i
have
before
my
eyes
at
this
moment
four
or
five
hundred
pictures
which
have
been
sold
to
me
as
but
which
i
consider
as
in
reality
among
the
most
detestable
and
irreverent
of
any
kind
of
merchandise
a
great
political
journal
the
other
day
gave
to
one
of
its
leaders
the
title
of
i
can
not
give
a
title
to
my
letter
but
were
it
possible
to
do
so
i
should
choose
this
one
in
preference
to
any
other
i
am
in
the
unfortunate
state
of
a
man
who
has
swallowed
several
kilograms
of
adulterated
honey
i
am
suffering
from
an
indigestion
of
sugar
and
what
sugar
whilst
in
the
act
of
buying
these
little
horrors
i
beheld
numberless
purchasers
succeed
each
other
with
feverish
eagerness
in
the
shops
which
i
will
not
specify
yes
i
had
the
pain
of
meeting
there
with
christian
brothers
and
with
sisters
of
charity
who
made
me
sigh
by
their
simple
avidity
and
ingenuous
delight
at
the
sight
of
these
frightful
little
black
or
prints
they
bought
them
by
hundreds
by
thousands
by
ten
thousands
for
schools
for
orphanages
for
missions
ah
my
dear
friend
how
many
souls
are
going
to
be
well
treacled
in
our
hapless
world
it
is
the
triumph
of
confectionery
are
you
choosing
such
machines
as
these
i
asked
of
the
good
brother
theodore
whom
to
my
great
astonishment
i
found
among
the
purchasers
are
are
know
are
purse
is
only
too
well
aware
of
the
why
do
you
buy
them
i
find
that
these
only
are
and
thereupon
the
worthy
man
told
me
that
he
had
the
other
day
distributed
among
his
children
pictures
taken
from
the
fine
head
of
our
saviour
attributed
to
morales
a
the
children
however
perceiving
that
there
was
no
gilding
upon
them
had
thrown
them
aside
gaping
decidedly
the
evil
is
greater
than
i
had
supposed
and
it
is
time
to
consider
what
is
to
be
done
in
spite
of
all
this
i
have
bought
your
provision
of
pictures
but
do
not
be
uneasy
i
am
keeping
them
myself
and
will
proceed
to
describe
them
to
you
i
do
not
wish
that
the
taste
of
your
beloved
poor
should
be
vitiated
by
the
sight
of
these
mawkish
designs
but
i
will
take
upon
myself
to
analyze
them
for
your
benefit
and
then
see
if
you
are
not
very
soon
as
indignant
as
myself
in
the
first
place
we
have
the
pictures
and
these
are
the
most
numerous
of
all
i
do
not
want
to
say
too
much
against
them
you
know
in
what
high
estimation
i
hold
true
symbolism
and
we
have
many
a
time
exchanged
our
thoughts
on
this
admirable
form
of
the
activity
of
the
human
mind
a
symbol
is
a
comparison
between
things
belonging
to
the
physical
and
things
belonging
to
the
immaterial
world
now
these
two
worlds
are
in
perfect
harmony
with
each
other
to
each
phenomenon
of
the
moral
order
there
corresponds
exactly
a
phenomenon
of
the
visible
order
if
we
compare
these
two
facts
with
each
other
we
have
a
symbol
there
is
a
life
a
breath
a
whiteness
which
are
material
figurative
language
is
nothing
else
than
a
vast
and
wonderful
symbolism
and
you
remember
the
marvellous
things
written
on
this
subject
by
the
lamented
landriot
in
the
supernatural
order
it
is
the
same
and
all
christian
generations
have
made
use
of
symbolism
to
express
the
most
sacred
objects
of
their
adoration
there
has
been
the
symbolism
of
the
catacombs
there
has
been
also
that
of
the
middle
ages
the
two
although
not
resembling
nevertheless
complete
each
other
and
eloquently
attest
the
fact
that
the
christian
race
has
never
been
without
the
use
of
symbols
thus
it
is
not
symbolism
which
i
condemn
but
this
particular
symbolism
of
which
i
am
about
to
speak
and
which
is
so
odiously
silly
i
write
to
you
with
the
proofs
before
me
i
am
not
inventing
but
merely
reflecting
i
am
not
an
author
but
a
photographer
firstly
here
we
have
a
ladder
which
represents
way
of
the
soul
towards
this
is
very
well
although
moderately
ideal
but
then
who
is
mounting
this
ladder
you
would
never
guess
it
is
a
dove
yes
the
poor
bird
is
painfully
climbing
up
the
rounds
as
if
she
were
a
hen
getting
back
to
roost
and
apparently
forgetting
that
she
owns
a
pair
of
wings
but
we
shall
find
this
dove
elsewhere
for
our
pictures
are
full
of
the
species
and
are
in
fact
a
very
i
perceive
down
there
another
animal
it
is
a
roe
with
her
fawn
and
with
amazement
i
read
this
legend
fecundity
of
the
breast
of
the
roe
is
the
image
of
the
abundance
and
sweetness
of
why
was
the
roe
selected
and
why
milk
strange
but
here
again
we
have
a
singular
collection
on
a
heart
crowned
with
roses
is
placed
a
candlestick
a
candlestick
on
a
heart
and
this
candelabrum
price
sous
is
surmounted
by
a
lighted
candle
around
which
angels
are
pressing
this
we
are
told
underneath
is
does
it
mean
that
we
are
to
set
one
for
the
blessed
angels
to
follow
next
what
do
i
see
here
a
guitar
and
this
at
the
foot
of
the
cross
let
us
see
what
can
be
the
reason
of
this
mysterious
assemblage
the
text
furnishes
it
me
délasserai
à
de
la
will
refresh
myself
in
the
shelter
of
the
from
whence
it
follows
that
one
can
play
the
guitar
upon
golgotha
touching
emblem
and
what
do
you
say
of
this
other
in
which
our
saviour
jesus
the
word
and
as
bossuet
says
the
reason
and
interior
discourse
of
the
eternal
father
is
represented
as
occupied
in
killing
i
know
not
what
little
insects
on
the
leaves
of
a
divine
gardener
destroys
the
caterpillars
which
make
havoc
in
his
garden
says
the
legend
i
imagine
nothing
but
merely
transcribe
and
for
my
part
would
gladly
turn
insecticide
to
this
collection
of
this
hand
issuing
out
of
a
cloud
i
recognize
as
the
hand
of
my
lord
god
the
creator
and
father
of
all
who
is
at
the
same
time
their
comforter
their
stay
and
their
life
i
admit
this
symbol
which
is
ancient
and
truly
christian
but
this
divine
hand
which
the
middle
ages
would
most
carefully
have
guarded
against
charging
with
any
kind
of
burden
this
hand
which
represents
eternal
justice
and
eternal
goodness
can
you
imagine
what
it
is
here
made
to
hold
not
even
the
fiery
bolt
which
the
heathen
of
old
times
represented
in
the
grasp
of
their
jupiter
tonans
but
a
horrible
and
stupid
little
from
the
spout
of
which
trickles
a
driblet
of
water
upon
the
cup
of
a
lily
further
on
i
see
the
said
is
replaced
by
a
sort
of
jug
which
the
eternal
is
emptying
upon
souls
in
the
shape
of
doves
and
this
the
legend
kindly
informs
me
is
heavenly
heavenly
dew
trickling
out
of
a
jug
and
there
are
individuals
who
can
imagine
and
depict
a
thing
like
this
when
the
beneficent
creator
daily
causes
to
descend
from
his
beautiful
sky
those
milliards
of
little
pearly
drops
which
sparkle
in
the
morning
sunshine
on
the
fair
mantle
of
our
earth
water
it
must
be
owned
is
scarcely
a
successful
subject
under
any
form
with
our
here
is
a
poor
and
thread
lifting
itself
up
above
a
basin
while
i
am
informed
underneath
that
jet
of
water
is
the
image
of
the
soul
lifting
itself
towards
god
by
i
also
need
to
be
enlightened
as
to
how
river
turned
aside
from
its
course
is
an
image
of
the
good
use
and
of
the
abuse
of
it
is
obscure
but
still
it
does
not
vulgarize
and
debase
a
beautiful
and
scriptural
image
like
the
next
i
will
mention
in
which
over
the
motto
of
the
lamp
image
of
the
cultivation
of
grace
in
our
hearts
we
have
a
taking
her
great
oily
scissors
and
cutting
the
wick
of
which
she
scatters
the
blackened
fragments
no
matter
where
the
quantity
of
ribbon
and
string
used
up
by
these
is
something
incalculable
here
lines
of
string
unite
all
the
hearts
of
the
faithful
doves
again
to
the
heart
of
our
blessed
lady
there
mary
herself
the
immaculate
one
and
our
own
incomparable
mother
from
the
height
of
heaven
holds
in
leash
by
an
interminable
length
of
string
a
certain
little
dove
around
the
neck
of
which
there
hangs
a
scapular
this
we
are
told
means
that
is
the
directress
of
the
obedient
elsewhere
the
string
is
replaced
by
pretty
or
ribbons
which
have
doubtless
a
delicious
effect
to
those
who
can
appreciate
it
here
is
a
young
girl
walking
along
cheerfully
enough
notwithstanding
that
her
heart
is
tied
by
one
of
these
elegant
ribbons
to
that
of
the
blessed
mother
of
god
apparently
without
causing
her
the
slightest
inconvenience
her
situation
however
is
i
think
less
painful
than
that
of
this
other
young
person
who
is
occupied
in
carving
her
own
heart
into
a
shape
resembling
that
of
mary
another
young
female
has
hoisted
this
organ
her
own
on
an
easel
and
is
painting
it
after
the
same
pattern
but
let
us
hasten
out
of
this
atelier
to
breathe
the
open
air
among
these
trees
alas
we
there
find
under
the
form
and
features
of
an
effeminate
child
of
eight
years
old
divine
gardener
putting
a
prop
to
a
sapling
tree
or
on
the
wild
stock
the
germ
of
good
this
is
all
pretty
well
but
what
can
be
said
of
this
ciborium
which
has
been
energetically
stuck
into
a
lily
with
the
legend
seek
a
pure
these
gentlemen
indeed
treat
you
to
the
most
holy
eucharist
with
a
that
is
by
no
means
fitting
or
reverent
it
is
forbidden
to
the
hands
of
laics
to
touch
the
sacred
vessels
and
it
is
only
just
that
the
same
prohibition
should
apply
to
they
are
entreated
not
to
handle
thus
lightly
and
irreverently
that
which
is
the
object
of
our
faith
our
hope
and
our
love
hitherto
i
have
refrained
from
touching
upon
that
very
delicate
subject
which
it
is
nevertheless
necessary
that
i
should
approach
namely
the
representation
of
the
sacred
heart
and
here
i
feel
myself
at
ease
having
beforehand
submitted
to
all
the
decisions
of
the
church
and
having
for
long
past
made
it
my
great
aim
to
be
penetrated
with
her
spirit
like
yourself
i
have
a
real
devotion
to
the
sacred
heart
nor
do
i
wish
to
conceal
it
when
any
devotion
takes
so
wide
a
development
in
the
holy
church
it
is
because
it
is
willed
by
god
who
watches
unceasingly
over
her
destinies
and
the
forms
of
worship
which
she
renders
to
him
all
catholics
are
agreed
upon
this
point
it
is
true
that
certain
among
them
regard
the
sacred
heart
as
the
symbol
of
divine
love
and
that
others
consider
it
under
the
aspect
of
a
very
adorable
part
of
the
body
of
the
and
if
i
may
so
express
it
as
a
kind
of
centralized
eucharist
well
i
hold
that
to
be
accurate
one
ought
to
admit
and
harmonize
the
two
systems
and
therefore
i
do
so
you
are
aware
that
it
is
my
belief
that
physiology
does
not
yet
sufficiently
understand
the
mechanism
of
our
material
heart
and
i
await
discoveries
on
that
subject
which
shall
establish
the
fact
of
its
necessity
to
our
life
the
other
day
at
i
remained
a
long
time
carefully
examining
a
fine
engraving
representing
the
circulation
of
the
blood
through
the
veins
and
arteries
and
i
especially
contemplated
the
heart
the
source
and
receptacle
of
this
double
movement
and
said
to
myself
worship
of
the
sacred
heart
will
be
one
day
justified
by
but
why
do
i
say
this
when
it
is
so
already
behold
me
then
on
my
knees
before
the
sacred
heart
of
my
god
in
which
i
behold
at
the
same
time
an
admirable
symbol
and
a
yet
more
admirable
reality
but
is
this
a
reason
for
representing
the
sacred
heart
in
a
manner
alike
ridiculous
and
odious
i
will
not
here
enter
upon
the
question
as
to
whether
it
is
allowable
to
represent
the
sacred
heart
of
jesus
otherwise
than
in
his
sacred
breast
and
i
only
seek
to
know
in
order
to
accept
unhesitatingly
whatever
with
regard
to
this
may
be
the
thought
of
the
church
but
that
which
to
my
mind
is
utterly
revolting
is
the
sight
of
the
profanations
of
which
these
are
guilty
what
right
have
they
and
how
do
they
dare
to
represent
hundreds
of
consecrated
hosts
issuing
from
the
sacred
heart
and
a
dove
pecking
at
them
as
they
are
dropping
down
what
right
have
they
to
make
the
heart
of
our
lord
god
a
a
for
these
everlasting
doves
or
into
a
vase
out
of
which
they
are
drinking
what
right
have
they
to
insert
a
little
heart
ours
into
the
divine
heart
of
jesus
what
right
have
they
to
represent
to
us
a
pelion
ossa
and
olympus
on
a
small
scale
three
hearts
the
one
piled
upon
the
other
and
cascades
of
blood
pouring
from
the
topmost
which
is
that
of
our
lord
upon
the
second
which
is
that
of
his
blessed
mother
and
thence
upon
the
third
which
is
our
own
what
right
have
they
to
make
the
sacred
heart
shed
showers
of
roses
or
to
give
its
form
to
their
lastly
what
right
have
they
to
lodge
it
in
the
middle
of
a
flower
and
make
the
latter
address
to
it
the
scented
question
would
you
desire
me
to
do
in
order
that
i
may
be
agreeable
to
you
ye
beware
of
asking
me
the
same
question
for
both
you
and
i
very
well
know
what
would
be
the
answer
the
truth
is
that
these
clumsy
persons
manage
to
spoil
everything
they
touch
and
they
have
dishonored
the
symbolism
of
the
dove
as
they
have
compromised
the
representations
of
the
sacred
heart
the
dove
is
undoubtedly
one
of
the
most
ancient
and
evangelical
of
all
the
christian
symbols
but
a
certain
discretion
is
nevertheless
necessary
in
the
employment
of
this
emblem
of
the
holy
spirit
of
god
this
discretion
never
failed
our
forefathers
who
scarcely
ever
depicted
the
dove
except
only
in
the
scene
of
our
baptism
and
in
representations
of
the
blessed
trinity
in
the
latter
the
eternal
father
vested
in
pontifical
or
imperial
robes
holds
between
his
arms
the
cross
whereon
hangs
his
son
while
the
holy
dove
passes
from
the
father
to
the
son
as
the
eternal
love
which
unites
them
this
is
well
simple
and
even
fine
but
there
is
a
vast
difference
between
this
and
the
present
abuse
and
vulgarization
of
the
dove
as
an
emblem
where
it
is
made
use
of
to
represent
the
faithful
soul
no
truly
one
is
weary
of
all
this
do
you
see
this
flight
of
young
pigeons
hovering
about
with
hearts
in
their
beaks
the
beaks
are
very
small
and
the
hearts
very
large
but
you
are
intended
to
understand
by
this
that
souls
rise
rapidly
to
great
these
other
doves
lower
down
give
themselves
less
trouble
and
fatigue
they
are
quietly
pecking
into
a
heart
and
i
read
this
legend
heart
of
love
is
inexhaustible
let
us
go
to
it
in
all
our
the
pigeon
that
i
see
a
little
farther
off
is
not
without
his
difficulties
he
is
carrying
a
stout
stick
in
his
delicate
beak
and
would
you
believe
it
the
explanation
of
this
remarkable
symbol
is
rod
and
thy
staff
have
comforted
here
again
are
bringing
us
in
their
beaks
letters
in
charming
envelopes
one
of
these
birds
who
possibly
may
belong
to
the
variety
knows
as
tumbler
pigeons
has
evidently
fallen
into
the
water
for
he
is
shown
to
us
standing
to
recover
himself
on
what
appears
to
be
a
heap
of
mud
in
the
middle
of
the
ocean
with
the
motto
he
is
saved
next
i
come
upon
a
party
of
doves
again
always
doves
whose
occupation
is
certainly
no
sinecure
oars
have
been
fitted
to
their
feeble
claws
and
these
hapless
creatures
are
rowing
here
is
another
unfortunate
pigeon
she
is
in
prison
with
a
thick
chain
fastened
to
her
left
foot
and
we
are
told
that
she
is
on
the
damp
straw
of
the
further
on
appears
another
of
this
luckless
species
on
its
back
with
its
claws
in
the
air
it
is
dead
so
much
the
better
it
is
not
i
who
will
encourage
it
to
be
so
unwise
as
to
return
to
life
true
in
default
of
doves
other
symbols
will
not
be
found
lacking
here
are
some
of
the
tender
kind
little
souvenirs
to
be
exchanged
between
friend
and
friend
wherein
one
finds
i
know
not
what
indescribable
conglomerations
of
religious
sentiment
and
natural
friendship
flowers
on
all
sides
flowers
pansies
lilies
and
underneath
all
the
treasures
of
literature
is
a
friend
who
offers
you
or
far
away
yours
will
pass
friendship
will
la

this
last
is
in
verse
i
know
not
my
dear
friend
whether
you
feel
with
me
on
this
point
while
persuading
myself
that
all
these
playfulnesses
are
very
innocent
i
yet
find
in
them
a
certain
something
which
strikes
me
as
interloping
and
i
do
not
like
mixtures
we
have
also
the
pictures
heaven
forbid
that
i
should
speak
evil
of
the
which
embalmed
with
their
perfume
all
the
dear
middle
ages
to
which
i
have
devoted
so
much
of
my
life
but
we
have
in
these
pictures
of
which
i
am
speaking
mixtures
which
are
to
my
mind
detestable
and
i
can
not
endure
this
pretty
little
boat
of
which
the
sails
are
covered
with
its
mast
is
the
pontifical
cross
and
its
pilot
the
sacred
heart
is
another
allusion
to
legitimacy
intended
in
this
cross
surrounded
with
flowers
and
bearing
the
legend
beloved
delights
himself
among
the
i
can
not
tell
but
if
we
let
each
political
party
have
free
access
to
our
religious
we
shall
see
strange
things
and
then
aux
abeilles
of
the
one
characteristic
common
to
all
these
wretched
picturelings
is
their
insipidity
and
petty
childishness
they
are
a
literature
of
nurses
and
the
designers
must
surely
belong
to
the
female
portion
of
humanity
for
one
is
conscious
everywhere
of
the
invisible
hand
of
woman
one
is
unwilling
to
conceive
it
possible
that
any
one
with
a
beard
on
the
chin
could
bring
himself
to
invent
similar
meagrenesses
these
persons
are
afraid
of
man
and
have
wisely
adopted
the
plan
of
never
painting
him
and
of
making
everybody
under
the
age
of
ten
years
never
have
they
had
any
clear
or
serious
idea
of
the
word
the
god
made
man
of
him
the
mighty
and
terrible
one
who
pronounced
anathema
on
the
pharisees
and
the
sellers
in
the
temple
they
can
but
represent
a
little
jesus
in
wax
or
sugar
or
treacle
and
alarmed
at
the
loftiness
of
divinity
and
being
incapable
of
hewing
his
human
form
in
marble
they
have
kneaded
it
in
gingerbread
and
yet
our
greatest
present
want
is
manliness
truly
truly
in
france
we
have
no
more
men
let
us
then
have
no
more
of
these
childishnesses
but
let
us
behold
in
the
divine
splendor
and
perfect
manhood
of

eternal
type
of
regenerated
humanity

memories
that

often
rise
from
one
rash
hour
the
king
of
metals
from
the
french
there
once
lived
a
widow
named
mary
jane
who
had
a
beautiful
daughter
called
flora
the
widow
was
a
sensible
humble
woman
the
daughter
on
the
contrary
was
very
haughty
many
young
persons
desired
her
in
marriage
but
she
found
none
to
please
her
the
greater
the
number
of
her
suitors
the
more
disdainful
she
became
one
night
the
mother
awoke
and
being
unable
to
compose
herself
again
to
sleep
she
began
to
say
her
rosary
for
flora
whose
pride
gave
her
a
great
deal
of
disquietude
flora
was
asleep
near
her
and
she
smiled
in
her
sleep
the
next
day
mary
jane
inquired
beautiful
dream
had
you
that
caused
you
to
smile
in
your
sleep
dreamed
that
a
great
lord
conducted
me
to
church
in
a
copper
coach
and
gave
me
a
ring
composed
of
precious
stones
that
shone
like
stars
and
when
i
entered
the
church
the
people
in
the
church
looked
only
at
the
mother
of
god
and
at
what
a
proud
dream
cried
the
widow
humbly
drooping
her
head
flora
began
to
sing
that
same
day
a
young
peasant
of
good
reputation
asked
her
to
marry
him
this
offer
her
mother
approved
but
flora
said
to
him
were
you
to
seek
me
in
a
coach
of
copper
and
wed
me
with
a
ring
brilliant
as
the
stars
i
would
not
accept
the
following
night
mary
jane
being
wakeful
began
to
pray
and
looking
at
flora
saw
her
smile
dream
did
you
have
last
night
she
asked
flora
dreamed
that
a
great
lord
came
for
me
in
a
coach
of
silver
gave
me
a
coronet
of
gold
and
when
i
entered
the
church
those
present
were
more
occupied
in
looking
at
me
than
at
the
mother
of
poor
child
exclaimed
the
widow
an
impious
dream
pray
pray
earnestly
that
you
may
be
preserved
from
flora
abruptly
left
her
mother
that
she
might
not
hear
her
remonstrances
that
day
a
young
gentleman
came
to
ask
her
in
marriage
her
mother
regarded
this
proposal
as
a
great
honor
but
flora
said
to
this
new
aspirant
you
to
seek
me
in
a
coach
of
silver
and
offer
me
a
coronet
of
gold
i
would
not
wed
girl
cried
mary
jane
your
pride
pride
leads
to
flora
laughed
the
third
night
the
watchful
mother
saw
an
extraordinary
expression
on
her
countenance
and
she
prayed
fervently
for
her
in
the
morning
flora
told
her
of
her
dream
dreamed
she
said
a
great
lord
came
to
seek
me
in
a
coach
of
gold
gave
me
a
robe
of
gold
and
when
i
entered
the
church
all
there
assembled
looked
only
at
the
poor
widow
wept
bitterly
the
girl
left
her
to
escape
seeing
her
distress
that
day
in
the
of
the
house
there
stood
three
equipages
one
of
copper
the
other
of
silver
and
the
third
of
gold
the
first
was
drawn
by
two
horses
the
second
by
four
the
third
by
eight
from
the
first
two
descended
pages
clothed
in
red
with
green
caps
from
the
third
descended
a
nobleman
whose
garments
were
of
gold
he
asked
to
marry
flora
she
immediately
accepted
him
and
ran
to
her
chamber
to
decorate
herself
with
the
golden
robe
which
he
presented
to
her
the
good
mary
jane
was
sorrowful
and
anxious
but
countenance
was
radiant
with
delight
she
left
her
home
without
asking
the
maternal
benediction
and
entered
the
church
with
a
haughty
air
her
mother
remained
on
the
threshold
praying
and
weeping
after
the
ceremony
flora
entered
the
golden
equipage
with
her
husband
and
they
departed
followed
by
the
two
other
equipages
they
drove
a
long
a
very
long
distance
at
last
they
arrived
at
a
rock
where
there
was
a
large
entrance
like
the
gate
of
a
city
they
entered
through
this
door
which
soon
closed
with
a
terrible
noise
and
they
were
in
midnight
darkness
flora
was
trembling
with
fear
but
her
husband
said
yourself
you
will
soon
see
the
in
truth
from
every
side
appeared
little
creatures
in
red
clothes
and
green
caps
the
dwarfs
who
dwell
in
the
cavities
of
the
mountains
they
carried
flaming
torches
and
advanced
to
meet
their
master
the
king
of
metals
they
ranged
themselves
around
and
escorted
him
through
long
valleys
and
subterranean
forests
but
a
very
singular
thing
all
the
trees
of
these
forests
were
of
lead
at
last
the
cortége
reached
a
magnificent
prairie
or
meadow
in
the
midst
of
this
meadow
was
a
château
of
gold
studded
with
diamonds
said
the
king
of
metals
your
flora
was
much
fatigued
and
very
hungry
the
dwarfs
prepared
dinner
and
her
husband
led
her
to
a
table
of
gold
but
all
the
meats
and
all
the
food
presented
to
her
were
of
this
metal
flora
not
being
able
to
partake
of
this
food
was
reduced
to
ask
humbly
for
a
piece
of
bread
the
waiters
brought
her
bread
of
copper
of
silver
and
of
gold
she
could
not
bite
either
of
them
can
not
give
you
her
husband
said
bread
that
you
wish
here
we
have
no
other
kind
of
the
young
woman
wept
and
the
king
said
to
her
tears
can
not
change
your
fate
this
is
the
destiny
you
have
yourself
the
miserable
flora
was
compelled
to
remain
in
this
subterranean
abode
suffering
with
hunger
through
her
passion
for
wealth
only
once
a
year
at
easter
she
is
allowed
to
ascend
for
three
days
to
the

and
then
she

we

point
of

in
times

we

that
no

who

engagement

from

which
are

we
are
on

an
abyss
the

prostrated
now
for
several
years
in
italy
and
spain
by
the
suppression
of
the
religious

attacked
in
all
countries
abandoned
by
all
sovereigns
appears
humanly
speaking
to
be
on
the
brink
of
destruction
there
are
not
wanting
prophets
who
predict
the
collapse
of
christianity
and
the
end
of
the
world
there
are
however
manly
souls
who
do
not
allow
themselves
to
be
discouraged
and
who
see
grounds
for
hope
in
the
very
events
which
fill
ordinary
hearts
with
terror
and
consternation
of
this
number
is
an
american
religious
father
hecker
who
has
just
issued
a
pamphlet
in
english
wherein
without
concealing
the
difficulties
of
the
present
he
avows
his
expectation
of
the
approaching
triumph
of
religion
his
motives
are
drawn
from
the
deep
faith
he
professes
in
the
action
of
the
holy
spirit
in
the
church
outside
of
which
he
does
not
see
any
real
christianity
it
is
the
holy
spirit
whom
we
must
first
invoke
it
is
the
holy
spirit
of
whom
we
have
need
and
who
will
cure
all
our
ills
by
sending
us
his
gifts
age
he
says
superficial
it
needs
the
gift
of
wisdom
which
enables
the
soul
to
contemplate
truth
in
its
ultimate
causes
the
age
is
materialistic
it
needs
the
gift
of
intelligence
by
the
light
of
which
the
intellect
penetrates
into
the
essence
of
things
the
age
is
captured
by
a
false
and
science
it
needs
the
gift
of
science
by
the
light
of
which
is
seen
each
order
of
truth
in
its
true
relations
to
other
orders
and
in
a
divine
unity
the
age
is
in
disorder
and
is
ignorant
of
the
ways
to
true
progress
it
needs
the
gift
of
counsel
which
teaches
how
to
choose
the
proper
means
to
attain
an
object
the
age
is
impious
it
needs
the
gift
of
piety
which
leads
the
soul
to
look
up
to
god
as
the
heavenly
father
and
to
adore
him
with
feelings
of
filial
affection
and
love
the
age
is
sensual
and
effeminate
it
needs
the
gift
of
force
which
imparts
to
the
will
the
strength
to
endure
the
greatest
burdens
and
to
prosecute
the
greatest
enterprises
with
ease
and
heroism
the
age
has
lost
and
almost
forgotten
god
it
needs
the
gift
of
fear
to
bring
the
soul
again
to
god
and
make
it
feel
conscious
of
its
great
responsibility
and
of
its
the
men
to
whom
these
gifts
have
been
accorded
are
those
of
whose
services
our
age
has
need
a
single
man
with
these
gifts
could
do
more
than
ten
thousand
who
possessed
them
not
it
is
to
such
men
if
they
correspond
with
the
graces
which
have
been
heaped
upon
them
that
our
age
will
owe
its
universal
restoration
and
its
universal
progress
this
being
admitted
since
on
the
other
hand
it
is
of
faith
that
the
holy
spirit
does
not
allow
the
church
to
err
ought
we
not
now
to
expect
that
he
will
direct
her
on
to
a
new
path
since
the
xvith
century
the
errors
of
protestantism
and
the
attacks
upon
the
catholic
religion
of
which
it
gave
the
signal
have
compelled
the
church
to
change
to
a
certain
extent
the
normal
orbit
of
her
movement
now
that
she
has
completed
in
this
direction
her
line
of
defence
it
is
to
be
expected
that
she
will
resume
her
primitive
career
and
enter
on
a
new
phase
by
devoting
herself
to
more
vigorous
action
it
is
impossible
to
dispute
the
fresh
strength
which
the
definition
lately
promulgated
by
the
council
of
the
vatican
has
bestowed
upon
the
church
it
is
the
axis
on
which
now
revolves
the
career
the
renewal
of
religion
in
souls
and
the
entire
restoration
of
society
do
we
not
see
an
extraordinary
divine
working
in
those
numerous
pilgrimages
to
authorized
sanctuaries
in
those
multiplied
novenas
and
those
new
associations
of
prayer
and
do
they
not
give
evidence
of
the
increasing
influence
of
the
holy
spirit
on
souls
what
matter
persecutions
it
is
they
which
purify
what
remains
of
the
too
human
in
the
church
it
is
by
the
cross
we
come
to
the
light
crucem
ad
a
little
farther
on
the
author
explains
in
what
the
twofold
action
of
the
holy
spirit
consists
he
acts
at
one
and
the
same
time
in
an
intimate
manner
upon
hearts
and
in
a
manner
quite
external
on
the
church
herself
an
indefinite
field
of
action
conceded
to
the
sentiments
of
the
heart
without
a
sufficient
knowledge
of
the
end
and
object
of
the
church
would
open
the
way
for
illusions
for
heresies
of
every
kind
and
would
invite
an
individual
mysticism
which
would
be
merely
one
of
the
forms
of
protestantism
on
the
other
hand
the
exclusive
point
of
view
of
the
external
authority
of
the
church
without
a
corresponding
comprehension
of
the
nature
of
the
operations
of
the
holy
spirit
within
the
heart
of
every
one
of
the
faithful
would
make
the
practice
of
religion
a
pure
formalism
and
would
render
obedience
servile
and
the
action
of
the
church
sterile
moreover
the
action
of
the
holy
spirit
made
visible
in
the
authority
of
the
church
and
of
the
holy
spirit
dwelling
invisibly
in
the
heart
form
an
inseparable
synthesis
and
he
who
has
not
a
clear
conception
of
this
double
action
of
the
holy
spirit
runs
the
risk
of
losing
himself
in
one
or
other
of
the
extremes
which
would
involve
the
destruction
and
end
of
the
church
in
the
external
authority
of
the
church
the
holy
spirit
acts
as
the
infallible
interpreter
and
the
criterion
of
the
divine
revelation
he
acts
in
the
heart
as
giving
divine
life
and
sanctification
the
holy
spirit
who
by
means
of
the
teachings
of
the
church
communicates
divine
truth
is
the
same
spirit
which
teaches
the
heart
to
receive
rightly
the
divine
truth
which
he
deigns
to
teach
the
measure
of
our
love
for
the
holy
spirit
is
the
measure
of
our
obedience
to
the
authority
of
the
church
and
the
measure
of
our
obedience
to
the
authority
of
the
church
is
the
measure
of
our
love
for
the
holy
spirit
whence
the
saying
of
augustine
quisque
amat
ecclesiam
dei
tantum
habet
spiritum
it
is
remarkable
that
no
pope
has
done
so
much
for
the
despised
rights
of
human
reason
as
pope
pius
ix
that
no
council
has
done
better
service
to
science
than
that
of
the
vatican
none
has
better
regulated
its
relations
to
the
faith
that
none
has
better
defined
in
their
fundamental
principles
the
relations
of
the
natural
and
the
supernatural
and
the
work
of
the
pontiff
and
of
the
council
is
not
yet
finished
every
apology
for
christianity
must
henceforth
make
great
account
of
the
intrinsic
proofs
of
religion
without
which
people
of
the
world
would
be
more
and
more
drawn
to
see
the
church
only
on
her
human
side
the
holy
spirit
by
means
of
the
sacraments
consummates
the
union
of
the
soul
of
the
believer
with
god
it
is
this
end
which
true
religion
should
pursue
the
placing
in
relief
the
internal
life
and
the
constitution
of
the
church
and
the
intelligible
side
of
the
mysteries
of
the
church
in
short
the
intrinsic
reasons
of
the
truths
of
the
divine
revelation
combined
with
the
external
motive
of
credibility
will
complete
the
demonstration
of
christianity
such
an
exposition
of
christianity
founded
on
the
union
of
these
two
categories
of
proofs
will
have
the
effect
of
producing
a
more
enlightened
and
intense
conviction
of
religion
in
the
souls
of
the
faithful
and
of
stimulating
them
to
more
energetic
action
and
it
will
have
as
its
last
result
the
opening
of
the
door
to
their
wandering
brethren
and
gathering
them
back
into
the
bosom
of
the
church
with
the
vigorous
of
the
faithful
the
action
of
the
holy
spirit
will
raise
the
human
personality
to
such
an
intensity
of
strength
and
greatness
that
there
will
result
from
it
a
new
era
for
the
church
and
for
society
an
admirable
era
which
it
would
be
difficult
to
describe
in
human
expressions
without
having
recourse
to
the
prophetic
language
of
the
inspired
scriptures
ii
mission
of
in
pursuing
his
study
upon
the
action
of
the
holy
spirit
in
the
world
the
author
says
that
a
wider
and
more
explicit
exposition
of
the
dogmatic
and
moral
verities
of
the
church
with
a
view
to
the
characteristic
gifts
of
every
race
is
the
means
to
employ
in
order
to
realize
the
hopes
he
has
conceived
god
is
the
author
of
the
different
races
of
men
for
known
reasons
of
his
providence
he
has
impressed
on
them
certain
characteristic
traits
and
has
assigned
to
them
from
the
beginning
the
places
which
they
should
occupy
in
his
church
in
a
matter
in
which
delicate
susceptibilities
have
to
be
carefully
handled
it
is
important
not
to
exaggerate
the
special
gifts
of
every
race
and
on
the
other
hand
not
to
depreciate
them
or
exaggerate
their
vices
it
would
however
be
a
serious
error
in
speaking
of
the
providential
mission
of
the
races
to
suppose
that
they
were
destined
to
mark
with
their
imprint
religion
christianity
or
the
church
it
is
on
the
contrary
god
who
makes
the
gifts
and
qualities
with
which
he
has
endowed
them
in
the
expression
and
development
of
the
truths
which
he
created
for
them
nevertheless
no
one
can
deny
the
mission
of
the
latin
and
celtic
races
throughout
the
greater
part
of
the
history
of
christianity
the
first
fact
which
manifested
their
mission
and
established
the
influence
they
were
to
exercise
was
the
establishment
of
the
chair
of
peter
at
rome
the
centre
of
the
latin
race
to
rome
appertained
the
idea
of
the
administrative
and
governmental
organization
of
the
whole
world
rome
was
regarded
as
the
geographical
centre
of
the
world
the
greeks
having
abandoned
the
church
for
schism
and
the
saxons
having
revolted
against
her
by
heresy
in
the
xvith
century
the
predominance
which
the
latin
race
united
later
on
to
the
celtic
race
assumed
in
her
bosom
became
more
and
more
marked
this
absence
of
the
greeks
and
of
a
considerable
part
of
the
saxons
nations
whose
prejudices
and
tendencies
are
in
many
respects
similar
left
the
ground
more
free
for
the
church
to
complete
her
action
whether
by
her
ordinary
or
normal
development
or
by
the
way
of
councils
as
that
of
trent
and
that
of
the
vatican
that
which
characterizes
the
latin
and
celtic
races
according
to
our
author
is
their
hierarchical
traditional
and
emotional
tendencies
he
means
doubtless
by
this
latter
expression
that
those
races
are
very
susceptible
to
sensible
impressions
to
those
which
come
from
without
as
to
the
hierarchical
sentiment
of
the
celtic
and
latin
races
it
appears
to
us
that
for
upwards
of
a
century
it
has
been
much
weakened
if
it
be
not
completely
extinct
in
the
following
passage
the
author
is
not
afraid
to
say
of
the
saxon
race
is
precisely
the
importance
given
to
the
external
constitution
and
to
the
accessories
of
the
church
which
excited
the
antipathies
of
the
saxons
which
culminated
in
the
reformation
for
the
saxon
races
and
the
mixed
saxons
the
english
and
their
descendants
predominate
in
the
rational
element
in
an
energetic
individuality
and
in
great
practical
activity
in
the
material
one
might
have
feared
perhaps
a
kind
of
hardihood
arising
from
a
certain
national
partiality
in
regard
to
which
the
author
would
find
it
difficult
to
defend
himself
against
his
of
germany
if
he
had
not
added
of
the
chief
defects
of
the
saxon
mind
lay
in
not
fully
understanding
the
constitution
of
the
church
or
sufficiently
appreciating
the
essential
necessity
of
her
external
organization
hence
their
misinterpretation
of
the
providential
action
of
the
and
their
charges
against
the
church
of
formalism
superstition
and
popery
they
wrongfully
identified
the
excesses
of
those
races
with
the
church
of
god
they
failed
to
take
into
sufficient
consideration
the
great
and
constant
efforts
the
church
had
made
in
her
national
and
general
councils
to
correct
the
abuses
and
extirpate
the
vices
which
formed
the
staple
of
their
complaints
also
of
a
certain
feeling
of
repression
of
their
natural
instincts
while
this
work
of
the
was
being
perfected
they
at
the
same
time
felt
a
great
aversion
to
the
increase
of
externals
in
outward
worship
and
to
the
minute
regulations
in
discipline
as
well
as
to
the
growth
of
papal
authority
and
the
outward
grandeur
of
the
papal
court
the
saxon
leaders
in
heresy
of
the
xvith
century
as
well
as
those
of
our
own
day
cunningly
taking
advantage
of
those
antipathies
united
with
selfish
political
considerations
succeeded
in
making
a
large
number
believe
that
the
question
in
controversy
was
not
what
it
really
was
a
question
namely
between
christianity
and
infidelity
but
a
question
between
romanism
and
germanism
is
easy
to
foresee
the
result
of
such
a
false
issue
for
it
is
impossible
humanly
speaking
that
a
religion
can
maintain
itself
among
a
people
when
once
they
are
led
to
believe
it
wrongs
their
natural
instincts
is
hostile
to
their
national
development
or
is
unsympathetic
with
their
genius
misunderstandings
weaknesses
and
jealousies
on
both
sides
these
with
various
other
causes
led
thousands
and
millions
of
saxons
and
to
resistance
hatred
and
finally
open
revolt
against
the
authority
of
the
church
same
causes
which
mainly
produced
the
religious
rebellion
of
the
xvith
century
are
still
at
work
among
the
saxons
and
are
the
exciting
motives
of
their
present
persecutions
against
the
church
through
the
distorted
medium
of
their
saxon
prejudices
grown
stronger
with
time
and
freshly
stimulated
by
the
recent
definition
of
papal
infallibility
they
have
worked
themselves
into
the
belief
seeing
the
church
only
on
the
outside
as
they
do
that
she
is
purely
a
human
institution
grown
slowly
by
the
controlling
action
of
the
instincts
through
centuries
to
the
present
formidable
proportions
the
doctrines
the
sacraments
the
devotions
the
worship
of
the
catholic
church
are
for
the
most
part
from
their
corruptions
of
christianity
having
their
source
in
the
characteristics
of
the
races
the
papal
authority
to
their
sight
is
nothing
else
than
the
concentration
of
the
sacerdotal
tendencies
of
these
races
carried
to
their
culminating
point
by
the
recent
vatican
definition
which
was
due
in
the
main
to
the
efforts
and
the
influence
exerted
by
the
jesuits
this
despotic
ecclesiastical
authority
which
commands
a
superstitious
reverence
and
servile
submission
to
all
its
decrees
teaches
doctrines
inimical
to
the
autonomy
of
the
german
empire
and
has
fourteen
millions
or
more
of
its
subjects
under
its
sway
ready
at
any
moment
to
obey
at
all
hazards
its
decisions
what
is
to
hinder
this
ultramontane
power
from
issuing
a
decree
in
a
critical
moment
which
will
disturb
the
peace
and
involve
perhaps
the
overthrow
of
that
empire
the
fruit
of
so
great
sacrifices
and
the
realization
of
the
ardent
aspirations
of
the
germanic
races
is
it
not
a
dictate
of
and
political
prudence
to
remove
so
dangerous
an
element
and
that
at
all
costs
from
the
state
is
it
not
a
duty
to
free
so
many
millions
of
our
german
brethren
from
this
superstitious
yoke
and
slavish
subjection
has
not
divine
providence
bestowed
the
empire
of
europe
upon
the
saxons
and
placed
us
prussians
at
its
head
in
order
to
accomplish
with
all
the
means
at
our
disposal
this
great
work
is
not
this
a
duty
which
we
owe
to
ourselves
to
our
brother
germans
and
above
all
to
god
this
supreme
effort
is
our
divine
mission
it
would
be
impossible
to
enter
into
the
idea
of
the
bismarckian
policy
in
a
manner
more
ingenious
more
exact
and
more
striking
it
is
by
presenting
to
germany
this
monstrous
counterfeit
of
the
church
that
they
have
succeeded
in
provoking
its
hatred
of
her
and
the
new
empire
proposes
to
be
itself
the
resolution
of
a
problem
which
can
be
only
formulated
thus
adapt
latin
christianity
the
romish
church
to
the
germanic
type
of
character
and
to
the
exigences
of
the
empire
or
we
will
employ
all
the
forces
and
all
the
means
at
our
disposal
to
stamp
out
catholicity
within
our
dominions
and
to
exterminate
its
existence
as
far
as
our
authority
and
influence
this
war
against
the
catholic
religion
is
formidable
and
ought
not
to
leave
us
without
alarm
and
without
terror
truth
is
powerful
it
is
said
and
it
will
prevail
but
truth
has
no
power
of
itself
in
so
far
as
it
is
an
abstraction
it
has
none
except
on
the
condition
of
coming
forth
and
showing
itself
living
in
minds
and
hearts
what
is
to
be
done
then
no
thought
can
be
entertained
for
a
moment
of
modifying
catholic
dogmas
of
altering
the
constitution
of
the
church
or
of
entering
to
ever
so
small
an
extent
on
the
path
of
concessions
what
is
needed
is
to
present
religious
truth
to
minds
in
such
a
manner
as
that
they
shall
be
able
to
see
that
it
is
divine
it
is
to
prove
to
them
that
our
religion
alone
is
in
harmony
with
the
profoundest
instincts
of
their
hearts
and
can
alone
realize
their
secret
aspirations
which
protestantism
has
no
power
to
satisfy
for
that
the
holy
spirit
must
be
invoked
in
order
that
he
may
develop
the
interior
life
of
the
church
and
that
this
development
may
be
rendered
visible
to
the
persecutors
themselves
who
hitherto
see
nothing
in
her
but
what
is
terrestrial
and
human
already
a
certain
ideal
conception
of
christianity
exists
amongst
of
england
and
of
the
united
states
and
puts
them
in
the
way
of
a
more
complete
conversion
as
to
the
saxons
who
in
these
days
precipitate
themselves
upon
an
opposite
course
we
should
try
to
enlighten
their
blindness
already
we
have
seen
the
persecutors
whether
roman
or
german
become
themselves
christian
in
their
turn
we
shall
see
the
germans
of
our
days
exhibiting
the
same
spectacle
it
is
a
great
race
that
german
race
now
church
is
a
divine
queen
and
her
aim
has
always
been
to
win
to
her
bosom
the
imperial
races
she
has
never
failed
to
do
it
already
we
can
perceive
a
very
marked
return
movement
amongst
the
or
it
is
a
great
sign
of
the
times
at
different
epochs
there
have
been
movements
of
this
kind
in
england
but
none
exhibited
features
so
serious
as
that
of
which
we
are
witnesses
in
these
days
conversions
to
the
church
multiply
without
number
above
all
amongst
the
most
intelligent
and
influential
classes
of
the
nation
and
that
in
spite
of
the
violent
cry
of
alarm
raised
by
lord
john
russell
and
in
spite
of
the
attacks
of
the
gladstone
who
has
the
reputation
of
being
the
most
eloquent
man
in
england
the
gravitation
towards
the
catholic
church
exhibits
itself
in
a
manner
still
more
general
and
more
clear
in
the
bosom
of
the
united
states
the
catholics
in
that
country
amounted
to
scarcely
a
few
hundreds
at
the
commencement
of
this
century
they
form
now
a
sixth
of
the
population
of
the
united
states
they
number
about
and
the
catholic
is
the
only
religion
which
makes
any
real
progress
it
is
then
true
the
catholic
religion
flourishes
and
prospers
wherever
human
nature
has
its
due
liberty
let
them
but
give
to
the
church
rights
only
equal
to
those
of
other
confessions
and
freedom
of
action
and
we
should
see
her
regain
europe
and
with
europe
the
now
might
we
not
conclude
that
these
two
nations
england
and
the
united
states
are
predestined
by
providence
to
lead
the
saxons
themselves
in
a
vast
movement
of
return
towards
the
catholic
church
before
concluding
the
author
returns
to
the
latin
and
celtic
nations
and
directs
towards
them
a
sorrowful
glance
as
for
france
he
regrets
that
a
violent
reaction
against
the
abuses
of
the
ancient
régime
of
which
he
gives
a
somewhat
exaggerated
picture
has
brought
about
an
irreligious
revolution
and
a
political
situation
which
oscillates
ceaselessly
between
anarchy
and
despotism
and
despotism
and
anarchy
he
deplores
still
more
that
the
progressive
movement
has
been
diverted
from
its
course
in
spain
and
in
italy
by
the
evil
principles
imported
from
france
this
moment
says
the
author
is
in
danger
on
the
one
hand
of
being
exterminated
by
the
persecution
of
the
saxon
races
on
the
other
of
being
betrayed
by
the
apostasy
of
the
this
is
the
great
tribulation
of
the
church
at
the
present
time
between
these
two
perils
she
labors
according
to
human
probabilities
the
divine
bark
should
be
on
the
point
of
perishing
but
perish
it
can
not
god
can
not
abandon
the
earth
to
the
spirit
of
evil
christ
came
to
establish
the
kingdom
of
god
on
the
earth
as
a
means
of
conducting
men
to
the
kingdom
of
god
in
it
is
thus
in
his
last
chapter
our
author
surveys
the
future
the
last
three
centuries
from
the
nature
of
the
work
the
church
had
to
do
the
weight
of
her
influence
had
to
be
mainly
exerted
on
the
side
of
restraining
human
activity
her
present
and
future
influence
due
to
the
completion
of
her
external
organization
will
be
exerted
on
the
side
of
soliciting
increased
action
the
first
was
necessarily
repressive
and
unpopular
the
second
will
be
on
the
contrary
expansive
and
popular
the
one
excited
antagonism
the
other
will
attract
sympathy
and
cheerful
the
former
restraint
was
exercised
not
against
human
activity
but
against
the
exaggeration
of
that
activity
the
future
will
be
the
solicitation
of
the
same
activity
towards
its
elevation
and
divine
expansion
enhancing
its
fruitfulness
and
glory
different
races
of
europe
and
the
united
states
constituting
the
body
of
the
most
civilized
nations
of
the
world
united
in
an
intelligent
appreciation
of
the
divine
character
of
the
church
with
their
varied
capacities
and
the
great
agencies
at
their
disposal
would
be
the
providential
means
of
rapidly
spreading
the
light
of
faith
over
the
whole
world
and
of
constituting
a
more
christian
state
of
society
this
way
would
be
reached
a
more
perfect
realization
of
the
prediction
of
the
prophets
of
the
promises
and
prayers
of
christ
and
of
the
true
aspiration
of
all
noble
souls
is
what
the
age
is
calling
for
if
rightly
understood
in
its
countless
theories
and
projects
of
the
zealous
religious
who
is
the
author
of
this
important
manifesto
traversed
the
seas
in
order
to
submit
it
to
the
holy
father
a
mistake
father
hecker
went
to
europe
for
other
reasons
and
took
advantage
of
the
opportunity
to
submit
his
pamphlet
to
the
examination
of
the
roman
censors
and
other
eminent
theologians
if
we
are
well
informed
the
roman
curia
found
in
it
neither
error
nor
rashness
it
is
a
complete
plan
of
action
proposed
to
the
apostolate
of
the
church
for
the
future
the
old
era
would
close
a
new
one
would
open
on
this
ground
all
ancient
differences
should
disappear
bitter
and
useless
recriminations
would
be
laid
aside
all
would
be
moving
towards
the
same
future
in
accord
not
only
as
to
the
end
but
as
to
the
means
from
the
advances
daily
its
in
precipitating
itself
upon
the
church
bent
upon
her
destruction
is
doctrine
of
infallibility
has
made
spiritual
slaves
of
catholics
who
are
thus
a
hindrance
to
in
presence
of
so
furious
an
attack
every
voice
which
suggests
means
of
safety
deserves
our
best
attention
of
this
kind
is
a
pamphlet
published
lately
in
london
and
which
has
been
already
translated
into
french
german
and
italian
and
of
which
the
journals
of
different
countries
of
the
most
opposite
views
have
given
very
favorable
opinions
the
lamented
ravelet
would
had
he
been
spared
have
introduced
it
to
the
readers
of
the
for
he
had
met
its
author
at
rome
and
knew
how
to
appreciate
the
breadth
of
his
views
father
hecker
its
author
the
founder
of
the
paulists
of
new
york
is
celebrated
in
his
country
for
a
style
of
polemics
admirably
adapted
to
the
genius
of
his
does
he
understand
europe
to
which
he
has
made
prolonged
visits
equally
well
on
that
point
our
readers
will
soon
be
able
to
judge
how
is
it
that
the
catholic
religion
which
reckons
more
adherents
than
any
other
christian
religion
does
not
succeed
in
making
itself
respected
evidently
because
many
catholics
are
not
on
a
level
with
the
faith
which
they
profess
want
heroes
said
de
maistre
at
the
beginning
of
our
century
at
this
moment
is
not
the
demand
the
same
there
is
no
lack
of
religious
practices
a
number
of
exterior
acts
of
exterior
piety
are
performed
but
the
interior
life
of
souls
is
not
exalted
they
seem
to
be
afflicted
with
a
kind
of
spiritual
dyspepsia
the
crises
which
threaten
terrify
them
instead
of
inflaming
beforehand
their
courage
and
their
confidence
in
god
it
is
in
the
sources
of
religion
itself
we
shall
find
energy
it
is
to
them
we
must
betake
ourselves
to
reinvigorate
our
strength
in
the
direct
action
of
god
upon
our
consciences
and
in
the
operation
of
the
holy
spirit
upon
our
souls
from
this
source
issues
the
true
religious
life
and
our
external
practices
are
availing
only
so
far
as
they
are
inspired
by
this
internal
principle
itself
inspired
by
the
spirit
of
god
herein
are
the
primal
verities
of
christianity
at
every
epoch
of
decadence
the
voices
of
saints
remind
the
world
of
them
the
spirit
of
the
church
inclines
us
to
them
but
distracted
by
external
agitations
we
forget
to
correspond
with
its
suggestions
we
do
not
possess
enough
of
god
here
is
our
weakness
a
little
more
of
divinity
within
us
lo
the
remedy
father
hecker
has
well
written
upon
the
gifts
of
the
holy
spirit
and
upon
the
men
our
age
wants
intelligences
illuminated
from
on
high
wills
divinely
strengthened
is
not
that
what
is
wanted
to
maintain
the
struggle
is
he
not
right
when
he
asserts
that
one
soul
adorned
with
these
gifts
would
do
more
to
promote
the
kingdom
of
god
than
a
thousand
deprived
of
them
this
urgent
call
to
a
more
intensely
spiritual
life
will
touch
christian
hearts
but
the
pamphlet
foresees
an
objection
does
not
this
development
of
our
faculties
and
of
our
initiative
under
the
divine
influence
expose
us
to
some
of
the
dangers
of
protestantism
do
we
not
run
the
risk
of
the
appearance
of
strong
individualities
who
filled
with
their
own
ideas
will
think
themselves
more
enlightened
than
the
church
and
so
be
seduced
into
disobeying
her
authority
this
eternal
question
of
the
relation
of
liberty
to
authority
catholics
say
to
protestants
without
the
control
of
the
divine
authority
of
the
church
leads
insensibly
to
the
destruction
of
protestants
reply
amongst
you
has
stifled
liberty
you
have
preserved
the
letter
of
the
dogmas
but
spiritual
life
perishes
under
your
we
are
not
estimating
the
weight
of
these
reproaches
we
merely
state
the
danger
the
solution
of
the
religious
problem
consists
in
avoiding
either
extreme
no
catholic
is
at
liberty
to
doubt
that
the
holy
spirit
acts
directly
in
the
soul
of
every
christian
and
at
the
same
time
acts
in
another
way
indirect
but
no
less
precious
by
means
of
the
authority
of
the
church
cardinal
manning
has
written
two
treatises
on
this
subject
one
on
the
external
the
other
on
the
internal
working
of
the
holy
spirit
it
is
these
two
workings
which
father
hecker
endeavors
to
connect
in
a
lofty
synthesis
and
this
is
the
main
object
of
his
work
the
first
step
of
the
synthesis
is
the
statement
that
it
is
one
and
the
same
spirit
which
works
whether
by
external
authority
or
by
the
interior
impulse
of
the
soul
and
that
these
two
workings
issuing
from
a
common
principle
must
agree
in
their
exercise
and
blend
in
their
final
result
the
liberty
of
the
soul
should
not
dispute
the
authority
of
the
church
because
that
authority
is
divine
the
church
on
the
other
hand
can
not
oppress
the
liberty
of
the
soul
because
that
liberty
is
also
divine
the
second
step
is
to
prove
that
the
interior
action
of
the
holy
spirit
in
the
soul
alone
accomplishes
our
inward
sanctification
and
our
union
with
god
the
authority
of
the
church
and
generally
the
external
observances
of
religion
having
only
for
their
aim
to
second
this
interior
action
authority
and
external
practices
occupy
only
a
secondary
and
subordinate
place
in
the
catholic
system
contrary
to
the
notion
of
protestants
who
accuse
us
of
sacrificing
jesus
christ
to
the
church
and
of
limiting
christianity
to
her
external
action
the
completion
of
the
synthesis
is
in
the
following
the
individual
has
not
received
for
his
interior
life
the
promise
of
infallibility
it
is
to
peter
and
his
successors
that
is
to
say
to
the
church
that
jesus
christ
has
conceded
this
privilege
the
christian
thus
can
not
be
sure
of
possessing
the
holy
spirit
excepting
in
so
far
as
he
is
in
union
with
the
infallible
church
and
that
union
is
the
certain
sign
that
the
union
of
the
two
workings
of
the
holy
spirit
is
realized
in
him
we
have
no
doubt
that
this
theory
is
one
of
the
most
remarkable
theological
and
philosophical
conceptions
of
our
age
father
hecker
is
no
innovator
but
he
seizes
scattered
ideas
and
gathers
them
into
a
sheaf
of
luminous
rays
and
this
operation
which
seems
so
simple
is
the
result
of
thirty
laborious
meditation
one
must
read
the
pamphlet
itself
to
appreciate
its
worth
the
more
we
are
versed
in
the
problems
which
agitate
contemporary
religious
thought
the
better
we
shall
understand
the
importance
of
what
it
inculcates
we
shall
briefly
dispose
of
the
application
the
author
makes
of
his
synthesis
one
most
ingenious
one
is
that
protestantism
by
denying
the
authority
of
the
church
obliges
her
to
put
forth
all
her
strength
in
its
defence
if
luther
had
attacked
liberty
the
church
would
have
taken
another
attitude
and
would
have
defended
with
no
less
energy
the
free
and
direct
action
of
the
holy
spirit
in
souls
it
is
this
necessary
defence
of
divine
authority
which
gave
birth
to
the
jesuit
order
and
which
explains
the
special
spirit
which
animates
that
society
if
however
the
defence
of
assailed
authority
has
been
for
three
centuries
the
principal
preoccupation
of
the
church
she
has
not
on
that
account
neglected
the
interior
life
of
souls
it
is
sufficient
to
name
the
spirituality
so
deep
and
so
intense
of
philip
neri
francis
of
sales
john
of
the
cross
and
teresa
moreover
does
not
the
support
of
authority
contribute
to
the
free
life
of
souls
by
maintaining
the
infallible
criterion
for
testing
in
cases
of
doubt
the
true
inspirations
of
the
holy
spirit
the
church
in
these
days
resembles
a
nation
which
marches
to
its
frontiers
to
repel
the
invasion
of
the
foreigner
and
protect
its
national
life
its
victory
secured
it
recalls
its
forces
to
the
centre
to
continue
with
security
and
ardor
the
development
of
that
same
life
according
to
father
hecker
the
church
was
in
the
last
extremity
of
peril
he
sees
in
the
proclamation
of
the
infallibility
of
the
pope
the
completion
of
the
development
of
authority
provoked
by
the
reformation
and
believes
that
nothing
now
remains
but
its
application
if
since
the
xvith
century
external
action
has
predominated
in
the
church
without
however
ever
becoming
exclusive
so
now
the
internal
working
will
predominate
always
leaving
to
the
external
its
legitimate
share
only
this
new
phase
will
be
in
a
way
more
normal
than
the
preceding
because
in
religion
as
in
man
the
internal
infinitely
surpasses
the
external
without
however
annihilating
it
as
does
protestantism
this
internal
is
the
essence
of
christianity
it
is
the
kingdom
of
heaven
within
us
and
whose
frontiers
it
is
our
duty
to
extend
it
is
the
treasure
the
hidden
pearl
the
grain
of
of
the
gospel
it
is
to
this
interior
of
the
soul
that
our
lord
addressed
the
beatitudes
of
the
sermon
on
the
mount
the
external
church
the
priesthood
the
worship
the
sacraments
are
only
means
divinely
instituted
to
help
the
weakness
of
man
to
rise
to
the
worship
in
spirit
and
in
truth
announced
by
our
saviour
to
the
samaritan
woman
and
the
time
has
come
for
a
fuller
expansion
of
this
internal
life
for
the
more
general
development
of
the
spirit
of
francis
of
sales
and
of
the
other
saints
of
whom
we
spoke
above
as
to
those
outside
the
church
they
will
never
believe
in
this
evolution
because
they
suppose
that
the
doctrine
of
infallibility
has
condemned
us
to
a
kind
of
petrifaction
but
if
they
study
the
actual
situation
events
will
undeceive
them
from
this
present
moment
the
persecutions
which
deprive
the
church
of
her
temporalities
of
her
exterior
worship
of
her
religious
edifices
which
go
the
length
even
of
depriving
the
faithful
of
their
priests
and
bishops
which
suppress
as
far
as
they
can
the
external
part
of
catholicity
do
they
not
reveal
the
power
of
its
interior
in
the
parts
of
switzerland
and
germany
where
the
populations
are
robbed
of
their
clergy
and
worship
do
we
not
see
faith
developing
in
sacrifice
and
piety
becoming
more
serious
and
fervent
in
the
privation
of
all
external
aid
this
example
is
an
additional
proof
of
the
opportuneness
of
father
pamphlet
if
god
wills
that
the
persecution
should
increase
we
must
be
prepared
to
do
without
the
external
means
which
he
himself
has
instituted
and
which
he
accords
to
us
in
ordinary
times
for
we
must
not
forget
that
no
human
power
can
separate
us
from
god
and
that
so
long
as
this
union
exists
religion
remains
entire
as
to
its
substance
the
merit
of
the
christian
is
in
the
intention
which
inspires
his
acts
religion
exists
only
in
the
idea
which
clothes
its
rites
the
sacraments
the
channels
of
grace
are
only
effective
in
us
as
they
are
preceded
by
the
dispositions
of
our
soul
for
a
religion
not
to
degenerate
it
must
perpetually
renew
the
internal
life
in
order
to
resist
the
encroachments
of
routine
here
the
author
asks
what
is
the
polemic
best
suited
to
help
the
people
of
these
times
to
escape
from
their
unbelief
which
often
proceeds
from
regarding
the
church
as
having
fallen
into
formalism
and
into
a
debasing
authoritativism
he
believes
they
might
be
undeceived
by
disclosing
to
them
the
inner
life
of
religion
and
the
internal
proofs
of
her
divinity
an
idea
he
shares
with
the
most
illustrious
writers
of
our
age
lacordaire
wrote
to
mme
swetchine
that
he
had
reversed
the
point
of
view
of
the
controversy
in
scrutinizing
matters
from
within
which
manifested
truth
under
a
new
aspect
father
hecker
quotes
in
this
sense
the
striking
words
of
schlegel
shall
soon
see
i
think
an
exposition
of
christianity
appear
which
will
bring
about
union
among
all
christians
and
convert
the
unbelieving
ranke
said
with
no
less
decision
reconciliation
of
faith
and
science
will
be
more
important
as
regards
its
spiritual
results
than
was
the
discovery
three
centuries
ago
of
a
new
hemisphere
than
that
of
the
true
system
of
the
universe
or
than
that
of
any
other
discovery
of
science
be
it
what
it
the
pamphlet
ends
with
a
philosophy
of
race
and
here
the
author
whilst
acknowledging
his
fear
of
wounding
susceptibilities
expresses
the
hope
that
none
of
his
views
will
be
exaggerated
he
inquires
what
natural
elements
the
several
races
have
offered
to
the
church
in
the
successive
phases
of
her
history
and
starting
from
the
principle
that
god
has
endowed
the
races
with
different
aptitudes
he
examines
in
what
way
those
aptitudes
may
in
the
terrestrial
execution
of
the
designs
of
providence
the
races
who
almost
alone
remained
faithful
to
the
church
in
the
xvith
century
have
for
authority
and
external
observances
tastes
which
coincide
with
the
more
special
development
of
the
church
since
that
epoch
on
the
contrary
the
races
have
subjective
and
metaphysical
instincts
which
in
a
natural
point
of
view
should
attract
them
to
the
church
in
the
new
phase
on
which
she
is
entering
father
hecker
has
been
accused
with
some
asperity
of
predicting
that
the
direction
of
the
church
and
of
the
world
will
pass
into
the
hands
of
the
saxon
races
whose
conversion
sooner
or
later
he
anticipates
but
he
does
not
in
any
sense
condemn
the
latin
races
to
inferiority
he
merely
gives
it
as
his
opinion
that
the
latin
races
can
only
issue
from
the
present
crisis
by
the
development
of
that
interior
life
of
independent
reason
and
deliberate
volition
which
constitutes
the
force
of
the
saxon
races
god
has
not
given
the
church
to
the
latin
races
he
has
not
created
for
nothing
the
saxon
sclavonic
and
other
races
which
cover
the
surface
of
the
globe
they
have
their
predestined
place
in
the
assembly
of
all
the
children
of
god
and
are
called
to
serve
the
church
according
to
their
providential
aptitudes
father
hecker
and
newman
are
not
the
only
ones
who
think
that
the
absence
of
the
saxon
races
has
been
for
some
centuries
very
prejudicial
to
the
church
de
maistre
whose
bias
can
not
be
suspected
expressed
himself
even
more
explicitly
to
that
effect
the
latin
genius
under
the
inspiration
of
the
holy
spirit
has
been
and
will
continue
to
be
of
the
utmost
value
to
the
church
under
the
divine
influence
the
saxon
genius
will
in
its
way
effect
equally
precious
conquests
in
conclusion
we
summarize
thus
the
ideas
of
father
hecker
we
have
need
of
a
spiritual
awakening
the
definition
of
infallibility
has
lent
such
strength
to
the
church
that
henceforth
personality
may
become
as
powerful
as
possible
without
the
risk
as
in
the
xvith
century
of
injuring
unity
this
definition
having
completed
the
external
system
of
catholicity
the
initiative
of
the
church
proceeds
logically
to
concentrate
itself
on
the
aggrandizement
of
the
interior
life
which
is
the
essence
of
religion
this
is
proved
by
the
persecutions
which
augment
and
strengthen
the
religious
life
of
catholics
the
result
of
these
persecutions
will
be
to
unveil
to
protestants
and
unbelievers
the
interior
view
of
catholicity
and
to
prepare
the
way
for
religious
unity
this
unity
will
be
effected
when
protestants
and
unbelievers
see
that
catholicity
far
from
being
opposed
to
the
aspirations
of
their
nature
understands
them
and
satisfies
them
better
than
protestantism
and
this
expansion
of
catholicity
advances
slowly
because
it
meets
few
souls
great
enough
to
admit
of
the
full
development
of
its
working
and
of
showing
what
it
is
capable
of
producing
in
them
the
way
to
multiply
these
souls
is
to
place
ourselves
more
and
more
under
the
influence
of
the
holy
spirit
whatever
opinion
may
be
formed
of
certain
details
on
the
whole
this
work
manifests
a
high
grade
of
philosophical
thought
and
theological
insight
but
to
appreciate
it
fully
it
must
be
read
and
studied
exceptions
have
been
taken
to
it
on
the
ground
that
one
meets
nothing
in
it
but
theories
without
any
practical
conclusion
yet
what
can
be
more
practical
than
the
exhortation
which
confronts
us
on
every
page
to
seek
in
all
our
religious
acts
in
sacraments
worship
and
discipline
the
divine
intention
involved
therein
what
more
practical
than
to
urge
us
to
develop
all
the
forces
of
our
nature
under
the
divine
influence
and
to
tell
us
that
the
more
conscientious
reasonable
and
manly
we
are
the
more
completely
men
we
are
so
much
the
more
favorable
ground
will
the
church
find
within
us
for
her
working
far
from
urging
any
abrupt
change
father
hecker
recommends
that
everything
should
be
done
with
prudence
consideration
being
had
for
the
manners
of
every
country
he
is
persuaded
that
by
placing
more
confidence
in
the
divine
work
in
souls
they
will
become
insensibly
stronger
and
will
increase
thus
indefinitely
the
force
and
energy
of
the
whole
body
of
the
church
such
a
future
will
present
us
with
the
spectacle
of
the
conversion
of
peoples
who
at
present
are
bitterly
hostile
to
her
a
future
which
we
shall
purchase
at
the
cost
of
many
sacrifices
but
our
trials
will
be
full
of
consolations
if
we
feel
that
they
are
preparing
a
more
general
and
abundant
effusion
of
divine
illumination
upon
the
earth

scribner
armstrong
this
volume
is
a
compendium
of
one
of
those
books
of
memoirs
or
personal
recollections
bequeathed
to
us
by
the
survivors
of
the
english
renaissance
of
the
beginning
of
the
century
friends
and
by
patmore
this
the
editor
has
supplemented
in
the
case
of
hazlitt
by
some
letters
and
reminiscences
culled
from
the
published
by
his
grandson
carew
hazlitt
these
works
it
might
be
fairly
supposed
would
be
of
themselves
light
enough
for
the
most
jaded
and
flippant
appetite
however
the
aid
of
the
is
called
in
heaven
forgive
the
man
who
first
applied
that
title
honored
by
a
scaliger
and
a
bentley
to
the
modern
compiler
of
scandal
the
most
entertaining
and
doubtfully
moral
tidbits
are
picked
out
and
the
result
is
the
class
of
books
before
us
which
is
doing
for
the
national
intellect
what
pastry
has
done
for
its
stomach
the
mutual
courtesies
honorable
enough
when
rightly
understood
existing
between
publishers
and
the
periodical
press
make
honest
criticism
seem
ungracious
and
thus
the
public
judgment
is
left
uninstructed
by
silence
or
its
frivolous
tastes
are
confirmed
by
careless
approval
the
motives
impelling
the
awful
scissors
of
the
not
only
deprive
the
original
works
which
fall
under
them
of
the
modicum
of
value
they
may
possess
but
affirmatively
they
do
worse
they
give
an
absolutely
false
impression
of
the
persons
represented
thus
in
the
case
before
us
the
character
and
genius
of
lamb
are
as
ridiculously
overrated
as
his
true
merits
are
obscured
and
the
same
may
be
said
with
even
more
justice
of
the
portrait
given
of
hazlitt
singularly
enough
though
the
editor
derives
all
he
knows
or
at
least
all
he
presents
to
the
reader
from
patmore
and
carew
hazlitt
he
speaks
in
the
most
contemptuous
terms
of
both
one
he
pronounces
a
man
of
note
and
the
other
he
terms
with
a
delightful
unconsciousness
of
bumptious
bookmaker
profusely
addicted
to
scissors
and
and
both
he
bids
at
parting
to
room
for
their
if
such
be
the
character
of
patmore
and
hazlitt
what
opinion
we
may
ask
is
the
reader
called
upon
to
entertain
of
the
who
is
an
accident
of
their
existence
nor
is
it
in
relation
only
to
the
authors
after
whom

the
witticism
the
editor
levels
at
the
brightest
and
most
graceful
poet
of
his
age
a
master
and
maker
of
our
english
tongue
and
a
scourge
of
just
such
dunces
as
himself
of
the
writers
whose
habits
and
personal
characteristics
are
treated
of
in
this
volume
we
have
little
or
no
room
to
speak
nor
does
the
work
before
us
afford
any
sufficient
basis
to
go
upon
lamb
occupies
a
niche
in
the
popular
pantheon
as
an
essayist
higher
than
posterity
will
adjudge
him
his
essays
are
pleasing
and
witty
and
the
style
is
marvellously
pure
but
they
want
solidity
they
are
idealistic
humorous
subjective
they
fail
to
present
that
faithful
transcript
of
manners
or
to
teach
in
sober
tones
those
lessons
of
morality
which
make
the
older
essayists
enduring
other
works
are
already
forgotten
he
was
an
amiable
man
in
the
midst
of
unhappy
surroundings
and
his
unassuming
manners

enshrined
his
name
with
affection
in
the
works
of
his
contemporaries
was
not
a
character
to
be
admired
nor
in
many
ways
even
to
be
respected
he
was
devoured
with
vanity
and
grosser
passions

paupertas

has
often
been
the
sting
which
urged
genius
to
its
grandest
efforts
but
hazlitt
though
undoubtedly
a
man
of
genius
was
not
gifted
with
that
genius
of
the
first
order
which
abstracts
itself
wholly
from
the
miserable
circumstances
about
it
the
great
body
of
his
work
is
criticism
brilliant
entertaining
even
instructive
at
the
moment
in
which
it
was
produced
but
substantially
only
the
fashion
of

of

it
would
be
an
impertinence
to
say
anything
on
the
slight
foundation

the

has
placed
on
the
cover
of

motto

will

new

cudmore
the
author
of
this
work
informs
us
in
the
preface
that
his
object
has
been
to
condense
into
one
volume
the
colonial
general
and
constitutional
history
of
the
united
states
this
volume
professes
to
be
a
digest
of
the
writings
and
speeches
of
the
fathers
of
the
constitution
of
the
united

the
statutes
of
the

also

this
list
is
copied
from
the
author
it
will
be
seen
therefore
that
cudmore
has
set
himself
no
contemptible
task
to
accomplish
and
as
he
has
executed
it
in
a
thin
octavo
of
pages
it
may
reasonably
be
conjectured
that
he
possesses
a
talent
for
condensation

montesquieu
might
have
envied
vallandigham
finds
a
powerful
advocate
in
this
author
and
his
philippics
against
stanton
are
proportionately
severe
cudmore
has
a
fondness
for
notes
of
exclamation
and
such
is
the
ardor
of
constitutionalism
with
which
he
pursues
this
of
the
blackest
we
quote
cudmore
that
it
often
takes
three
notes
of
admiration
to
express
his
just
abhorrence
of
his
measures
the
bulk
of
the
work
is
taken
up
by
a
civil
and
military
history
of
the
late
conflict
and
the
disputes
that
preceded
it
if
we
might
venture
a
hint
to
cudmore
we
would
say
that
his
tone
is
a
little
too
warm
for
this
miserably
phlegmatic
age
which
affects
a
fondness
for
impartiality
in
great
constitutional
writers
the
fact
is
the
questions
which
the
author
discusses
with
the
greatest
spirit
are
dead
issues
they
still
preserve
a
faint
vitality
for
the
philosopher
and
speculative
statesman
but
they
have
sunk
out
of
sight
for
the
practical
politician

is
deserving
of
great
praise
the

eventually

gives
us
great
pleasure
to
express
with
slight
qualifications
our
entire
approval
of
this
work
so
far
as
its
moral
purport
is
concerned
its
plot
and
incidents
are
all
within
the
range
of
ordinary
life
and
experience
and
therefore
not
calculated
to
foster
in
the
youthful
reader
extravagant
anticipations
in
regard
to
his
own
future
there
are
many
good
hits
at
the
weaknesses
and
inconsistencies
of
human
nature
and
faithful
pictures
of
the
vices
and
miseries
to
which
an
unscrupulous
ambition
leads
selfishness
and
injustice
prosper
for
a
time
but
eventually
reap
their
reward

manliness

the

catholic
family
almanac
for
new
york
the
catholic
publication
society
when
applied
to
this
publication
seems
to
us
a
misnomer
the
popular
notion
of
an
almanac
is
a
thin
pamphlet
containing
incomprehensible
astrological
tables
delusive
prophecies
as
to
the
weather
advertisements
and
a
padding
of
stale
jokes
or
impracticable
recipes
gathered
from
country
newspapers
whereas
the
catholic
family
is
an
annual
of
pages
containing
each
year
enough
solid
information
to
furnish
forth
an
ordinary
volume
of
three
hundred
pages
to
say
nothing
of
the
many
fine
engravings
and
this
too
at
a
price
which
should
extend
its
circulation
to
equal
that
of
the

in
england
about
the
beginning
of
the

they
do
articles

interest
to
the

much
of
the

could
be

from

some
of
it

here
for

with
an
account

to
every
christian

to
be
got

only
by
much
reading
the

contains
an
ample
refutation
of
the
old
slander
that

useful
lessons
the
same
charming
freshness
which
won
for
its
wide
reputation

render
this

its

too
true

however
reluctant
we
may
be
to
acknowledge
the
fact
we
can
not
fail
to
see
that
our
progress
has
had
a
tendency
to
weaken
veneration
for
age
and
respect
for
authority
miss
alcott
shows
her
sympathy
with
this
fault
by
sometimes
placing
age
in
a
ludicrous
light
before
her
juvenile
readers
the
young
people
of
this
generation
do
not
need
any
encouragement
in
the
belief
that
age
does
not
always
bring
wisdom
and
we
the
more
regret
this
mistake
in
a
book
otherwise
commendable
destroy
the
confidence
and
veneration
with
which
childhood
looks
up
to
those
placed
over
it
and
you
rob
parents
of
that
which
constitutes
a
great
charm
in

consideration
of

he
has
had
opportunities
to
study
the
length
and
breadth
of
the

his
private
convictions
have
matured
amidst
the
most
varied
experience
of
all
classes
and
sections
of
our
people
first
in
a
profession
affording
ample
leisure
and
abundant
means
of
observation
from
an
independent
and
afterwards
in
commercial
life
which
placed
him
in
the
midst
of
daily
events
no
longer
as
a
theorist
but
as
one
actively
concerned
in
their
course
and
development
his
position
in
military
affairs
has
been
that
of
one
of
the
most
celebrated
commanders
of
the
age
and
his
political
career
has
been
that
of
an
independent
statesman
always
wielding
supreme
influence
and
quite
beyond
the
need
of
vulgar
trickery
in
order
to
maintain
its
power
having
almost
completed
an
illustrious
public
life
he
is
now
able
to
express
the
results
of
his
observations
and
no
one
can
lightly
question
the
validity
of
his
conclusions
the

prepared
to
receive
anything
he
may
have
to
say
to
it
with
solicitous
intelligent
and
earnest
consideration
those
who
may
differ
from
him
in
political
convictions
or
who
may
retain
a
partiality
for
some
of
his
less
successful
competitors
for
the
highest
prize
of
military
glory
and
even
those
who
go
so
far
as
to
question
his
greatness
all
must
admit
that
he
is
a
true
american
formed
and
moulded
by
the
events
in
which
he
has
moved
and
truly
representing
the
country
and
the
times
we
are
disposed
therefore
to
attach
the
fullest
importance
to
his
words
whether
spoken
officially
or
from
the
convictions
of
his
heart
and
to
ponder
them
respectfully
and
thoughtfully
on
the
of
september
last
his
excellency
attended
at
des
moines
the
capital
city
of
iowa
a
convention
of
the
of
the
tennessee
one
of
those
military
organizations
composed
of
veterans
of
the
late
war
the
nature
of
these
and
kindred
associations
is
not
political
their
aim
is
to
keep
up
a
brotherly
spirit
among
those
who
formerly
stood
shoulder
to
shoulder
on
the
nevertheless
the
gallant
men
who
thus
risked
life
and
limb
for
the
integrity
of
the
national
government
are
supposed
to
retain
their
patriotism
and
to
look
with
pride
and
zeal
upon
the
continuance
and
healthy
growth
of
those
institutions
which
are
vitally
connected
with
the
greatness
in
the
midst
of
such
an
assembly
composed
of
men
of
all
creeds
our
chief
magistrate
felt
called
upon
to
utter
a
prophetic
warning
which
has
excited
much
comment
at
home
and
has
been
extensively
published
abroad
we
print
his
speech
delivered
at
the
evening
session
of
the
of
the
tennessee
as
currently
reported
in
the
daily
press
president
grant
being
called
for
came
forward
and
said
it
always
affords
me
much
gratification
to
meet
my
comrades
in
arms
of
ten
and
fourteen
years
ago
and
to
tell
over
again
from
memory
the
trials
and
hardships
of
those
days
of
hardships
imposed
for
the
preservation
and
perpetuation
of
our
free
institutions
we
believed
then
and
we
believe
now
that
we
have
a
government
worth
fighting
for
and
if
need
be
dying
for
how
many
of
our
comrades
paid
the
latter
price
for
our
preserved
union
let
their
heroism
and
sacrifice
be
ever
green
in
our
memory
let
not
the
result
of
their
sacrifices
be
destroyed
the
union
and
the
free
institutions
for
which
they
died
should
be
held
more
dear
for
their
sacrifices
we
will
not
deny
to
any
of
those
who
fought
against
us
any
privilege
under
the
government
which
we
claim
for
ourselves
on
the
contrary
we
welcome
all
such
who
come
forward
in
good
faith
to
help
build
up
the
waste
places
and
to
perpetuate
our
institutions
against
all
enemies
as
brothers
in
full
interest
with
us
in
a
common
heritage
but
we
are
not
prepared
to
apologize
for
the
part
we
took
in
the
war
is
to
be
hoped
that
like
trials
will
never
again
befall
our
country
in
this
sentiment
no
class
of
people
can
more
heartily
join
than
the
soldier
who
submitted
to
the
dangers
trials
and
hardships
of
the
camp
and
the
on
whichever
side
he
fought
no
class
of
people
are
more
interested
in
guarding
against
a
recurrence
of
those
days
let
us
then
begin
by
guarding
against
every
enemy
threatening
the
prosperity
of
free
republican
institutions
i
do
not
bring
into
this
assemblage
politics
certainly
not
partisan
politics
but
it
is
a
fair
subject
for
the
soldiers
in
their
deliberations
to
consider
what
maybe
necessary
to
secure
the
prize
for
which
they
battled
in
a
republic
like
ours
where
the
citizen
is
the
sovereign
and
the
official
the
servant
where
no
power
is
exercised
except
by
the
will
of
the
people
it
is
important
that
the
sovereign
the
people
should
foster
intelligence
that
intelligence
which
is
to
preserve
us
as
a
free
nation
if
we
are
to
have
another
contest
in
the
near
future
of
our
national
existence
i
predict
that
the
dividing
line
will
not
be
mason
and
but
between
patriotism
and
intelligence
on
the
one
side
and
superstition
ambition
and
ignorance
on
the
other
the
centennial
year
of
our
national
existence
i
believe
is
a
good
time
to
begin
the
work
of
strengthening
the
foundations
of
the
structure
commenced
by
our
patriotic
forefathers
one
hundred
years
ago
at
lexington
let
us
all
labor
to
add
all
needful
guarantees
for
the
security
of
free
thought
free
speech
a
free
press
pure
morals
unfettered
religious
sentiments
and
of
equal
rights
and
privileges
to
all
men
irrespective
of
nationality
color
or
religion
encourage
free
schools
and
resolve
that
not
one
dollar
appropriated
for
their
support
shall
be
appropriated
to
the
support
of
any
sectarian
schools
resolve
that
neither
the
state
nor
nation
nor
both
combined
shall
support
institutions
of
learning
other
than
those
sufficient
to
afford
every
child
growing
up
in
the
land
the
opportunity
of
a
good
education
unmixed
with
sectarian
pagan
or
atheistical
dogmas
leave
the
matter
of
religion
to
the
family
altar
the
church
and
the
private
school
supported
entirely
by
private
contributions
keep
the
church
and
the
state
for
ever
separate
with
these
safeguards
i
believe
the
battles
which
created
the
army
of
the
tennessee
will
not
have
been
fought
in
taking
all
things
into
consideration
the
speech
is
fully
equal
to
any
written
production
of
the
president
it
is
direct
it
is
plain
it
is
manly
and
vigorous
and
far
superior
to
any
other
oration
which
we
have
heard
of
from
the
same
distinguished
quarter
beyond
all
things
it
expresses
better
than
many
imagine
the
common
sentiments
of
the
american
people
we
have
not
been
surprised
at
the
general
applause
with
which
it
has
been
greeted
and
we
think
that
all
our
readers
will
agree
in
the
judgments
which
we
are
about
to
express
with
regard
to
it
an
impression
has
been
spread
abroad
that
the
views
of
president
grant
are
hostile
to
the
catholic
church
and
that
the
speech
was
fulminated
by
his
zeal
against
it
it
has
been
averred
that
he
was
talked
into
making
a
public
manifestation
of
his
feelings
by
the
mayor
of
the
city
of
des
moines
who
called
his
attention
to
the
political
campaign
in
ohio
where
catholics
were
vainly
struggling
for
equal
rights
in
the
matter
of
the
public
schools
his
excellency
is
said
to
have
been
strongly
moved
and
hastened
home
from
his
ride
in
order
to
prepare
his
speech
for
the
evening
we
have
no
means
of
definitely
ascertaining
the
motives
of
the
speech
if
he
meant
to
hurl
a
thunderbolt
at
us
we
honor
him
for
using
language
in
the
main
so
just
and
courteous
but
if
his
friends
have
sought
to
make
use
of
him
to
stir
up
feeling
against
us
they
must
be
sadly
disappointed
at
his
words
for
if
they
now
repeat
them
too
freely
for
the
purpose
of
injuring
us
they
will
find
themselves
their
trying
as
hard
as
we
can
to
lash
ourselves
into
fury
trying
to
fancy
ourselves
insulted
by
representing
to
ourselves
that
the
head
of
this
nation
has
gone
out
of
his
way
and
abased
his
dignity
in
order
to
cast
an
aspersion
at
a
large
and
respectable
class
of
the
community
we
are
forced
to
give
it
up
and
to
lay
down
our
pen
for
we
find
nothing
in
the
oration
with
which
we
are
in
the
least
disposed
to
take
issue
on
the
contrary
we
are
prepared
to
join
our
tribute
to
the
burst
of
applause
which
echoes
through
the
land
we
are
convinced
that
if
it
meets
with
the
attention
which
it
merits
the
country
at
large
and
catholics
in
particular
will
treasure
the
moines
among
the
of
the
like
farewell
and
mighty
peroration
and
noble
and
pathetic
inaugural
it
will
pass
from
the
vulgar
atmosphere
of
party
strife
into
the
pure
and
serene
empyrean
of
immortality
we
have
given
the
speech
at
length
we
now
propose
to
explain
our
decision
with
regard
to
it
and
to
examine
at
greater
length
those
portions
of
it
which
seem
to
us
most
true
most
wise
and
most
remarkable
free
schools
the
president
says
resolve
that
not
one
dollar
appropriated
for
their
support
shall
be
appropriated
for
the
support
of
any
sectarian
do
we
hear
aright
does
the
president
of
the
united
states
maintain
the
proposition
which
has
brought
us
so
much
contempt
and
derision
what
is
a
free
school
a
free
school
is
one
in
which
every
scholar
can
obtain
an
education
without
violating
the
honest
convictions
of
conscience
or
to
use
the
words
of
the
president
a
free
school
is
one
where
education
can
be
obtained
with
sectarian
pagan
or
atheistical
are
our
common
schools
free
let
us
glance
at
the
general
history
of
the
controversy
concerning
them
as
soon
as
the
public
schools
had
ceased
to
be
purely
charitable
institutions
a
new
policy
was
inaugurated
by
our
people
the
government
assumed
that
it
was
bound
to
ensure
an
intelligent
use
of
the
franchise
by
encouraging
the
mental
activity
of
its
citizens
to
this
all
catholics
agreed
and
still
agree
but
our
protestant
rightly
desiring
that
some
religious
instruction
should
be
given
their
children
wrongly
insisted
upon
having
the
bible
read
in
the
schools
the
government
might
have
permitted
such
a
custom
to
continue
when
no
protest
was
made
against
it
but
it
soon
became
evident
that
the
schools
were
essentially
protestant
institutions
and
served
as
an
instrument
to
prevent
the
growth
of
this
was
no
secret
it
was
openly
preached
about
this
time
catholics
began
to
see
what
everybody
else
was
rejoicing
over
and
were
naturally
alarmed
they
had
assisted
to
found
and
build
up
the
republic
or
they
had
immigrated
under
the
assurance
of
equal
rights
to
find
it
proclaimed
a
protestant
country
was
news
to
them
they
insisted
that
the
government
was
bound
to
deny
this
imputation
and
they
registered
an
universal
protest
against
the
design
of
the
falsely
schools
we
have
demanded
either
that
we
be
relieved
from
taxation
for
these
sectarian
schools
or
that
such
arrangement
be
devised
as
shall
render
them
equally
desirable
for
catholics
and
we
were
not
called
upon
to
explain
why
we
so
earnestly
desired
this
it
was
business
but
our
own
the
public
schools
are
not
held
to
be
eleemosynary
institutions
they
are
ostensibly
for
the
benefit
of
all
and
even
if
they
were
places
for
the
confinement
of
criminals
or
almshouses
both
criminals
and
paupers
have
consciences
however
dull
or
uninformed
what
then
is
the
objection
to
our
having
a
right
to
direct
the
policy
on
which
public
institutions
are
to
be
conducted
none
but
if
we
were
to
have
taken
such
a
position
as
this
we
should
at
once
have
been
indicted
for
an
insidious
and
damnable
conspiracy
therefore
we
have
openly
stated
the
grounds
of
our
convictions
relying
on
the
inherent
force
of
truth
to
secure
our
rights
we
regard
morality
as
inseparable
from
religion
in
this
we
merely
echo
the
sentiments
of
the
greatest
american
statesmen
and
notably
of
the
father
of
our
republic
we
say
that
if
we
are
to
pay
for
the
education
of
our
children
we
should
like
to
have
the
worth
of
our
money
what
fairer
demand
can
a
yankee
make
we
ask
nothing
to
which
every
citizen
has
not
a
right
we
have
never
met
a
fair
reply
to
our
demands
or
a
fair
discussion
of
their
merits
first
we
were
greeted
with
silent
scorn
the
practical
operation
of
the
laws
was
found
to
force
our
children
into
protestant
schools
we
proclaimed
claimed
them
to
be
protestant
schools
it
was
unblushingly
denied
we
put
the
question
to
the
test
by
endeavoring
to
stop
the
protestant
bible
from
being
read
in
them
there
was
not
enough
power
in
our
voice
nor
enough
fairness
in
our
opponents
to
enforce
even
an
appearance
of
consistency
the
schools
were
pronounced
a
protestant
service
was
daily
carried
out
and
we
were
bidden
to
hold
our
tongues
and
to
be
thankful
and
now
that
we
are
not
willing
either
to
hold
our
peace
or
to
be
grateful
to
those
who
deny
us
our
equal
rights
a
loud
outcry
is
raised
and
every
manner
of
evil
is
predicted
unless
we
are
forcibly
restrained
the
party
of
malevolence
seeks
to
create
an
issue
where
none
exists
and
to
force
us
into
a
strife
in
which
it
can
avail
itself
of
superior
numbers
to
strike
us
a
cruel
and
unjust
blow
now
neither
this
design
nor
the
clamor
with
which
it
is
urged
can
be
defended
by
any
true
or
just
plea
and
we
venture
to
predict
that
there
is
too
much
intelligence
and
love
of
fair
play
in
the
american
people
to
allow
it
to
succeed
in
its
sinister
purpose
what
is
our
position
once
more
here
we
stand
on
the
same
basis
with
all
other
american
citizens
is
it
not
so
where
then
is
any
legal
disability
proved
against
us
we
ask
for
nothing
which
we
are
not
willing
to
concede
to
all
our
the
natural
right
to
have
their
children
brought
up
according
to
their
conscientious
convictions
we
want
and
we
will
have
our
children
brought
up
catholics
it
can
be
done
in
various
ways
the
state
can
pay
the
salaries
of
our
teachers
and
the
cost
of
our
buildings
and
other
expenses
securing
proper
guarantees
that
the
money
will
be
honestly
laid
out
and
the
children
receive
their
due
amount
of
secular
instruction
again
the
state
may
pay
a
and
allow
teachers
to
compete
for
scholars
this
is
done
in
protestant
england
and
prussia
as
well
as
in
catholic
france
and
austria
and
is
obviously
most
in
harmony
with
democratic
principles
other
ways
may
be
devised
which
will
secure
justice
to
all
parties
there
is
no
practical
difficulty
except
in
the
smallest
country
school
districts
these
are
always
settled
by
the
citizens
themselves
or
we
can
educate
our
children
without
the
state
the
state
may
let
us
alone
and
may
do
away
entirely
with
public
education
except
for
those
who
are
utterly
without
means
in
other
words
change
the
common
schools
into
charitable
institutions
and
let
parents
provide
but
this
we
are
persuaded
is
full
of
practical
difficulties
but
the
plan
actually
adopted
has
been
to
tax
all
alike
for
the
common
good
and
yet
maintain
a
system
which
perfectly
suits
protestants
but
to
which
catholics
can
not
honestly
or
conscientiously
agree
our
common
schools
are
not
free
millions
of
the
people
rise
up
and
proclaim
it
let
those
who
like
them
send
their
children
to
them
let
those
support
them
who
like
them
by
their
then
all
honor
to
president
grant
when
he
says
not
one
dollar
should
be
appropriated
to
the
support
of
any
sectarian
the
president
further
says
that
neither
state
nor
nation
nor
both
combined
shall
support
institutions
of
learning
other
than
those
sufficient
to
afford
every
child
growing
up
in
the
land
the
opportunity
of
a
good
education
unmixed
with
sectarian
pagan
or
atheistical
now
what
is
it
that
catholics
complain
of
except
that
the
state
has
supported
and
does
support
of
mixed
sectarian
pagan
and
atheistical
there
is
no
doubt
about
this
fact
protestants
insist
upon
having
the
bible
read
in
the
public
schools
lest
they
become
irreligious
catholics
maintain
that
the
version
used
is
garbled
and
that
even
if
it
were
not
no
one
has
a
right
to
teach
it
except
those
who
have
compiled
it
and
are
the
only
responsible
witnesses
to
its
true
meaning
the
jews
maintain
that
the
new
testament
part
of
it
is
not
true
infidels
deny
it
altogether
what
right
has
any
school
board
or
any
other
purely
human
institution
to
decide
this
controversy
and
what
right
has
any
man
under
the
constitution
to
enforce
his
religious
views
or
his
denial
of
religion
upon
others
it
is
an
outrage
it
is
an
inconsistency
which
can
not
be
stated
in
any
terms
without
transparently
manifesting
its
absurdity
under
the
constitution
and
according
to
the
spirit
of
our
government
all
men
are
equal
under
the
present
system
of
common
schools
and
according
to
the
spirit
of
those
who
uphold
them
men
are
not
equal
and
there
is
no
such
thing
as
regard
for
conscience
but
every
majority
has
a
right
to
enforce
upon
any
minority
no
matter
how
large
its
peculiar
ideas
of
instruction
involving
as
this
always
does
the
question
of
religion
itself
we
have
repeated
our
protest
until
we
are
almost
sick
and
tired
of
hearing
the
outrage
mentioned
we
have
never
seen
our
position
manfully
approached
within
beat
of
drum
and
yet
we
have
constantly
been
forced
to
ask
ourselves
the
american
people
never
see
this
can
it
be
that
our
enemies
are
as
some
of
them
hold
themselves
to
be
totally
depraved
some
time
ago
after
considerable
agitation
the
chicago
school
board
prohibited
the
reading
of
the
sacred
scriptures
in
the
public
schools
of
that
city
undoubtedly
the
protest
of
catholics
had
something
to
do
with
this
but
the
action
of
the
board
was
certainly
based
upon
the
idea
that
the
reading
of
the
protestant
bible
made
the
schools
protestant
institutions
and
therefore
unjust
towards
all
other
religious
bodies
let
it
be
thoroughly
understood
that
we
fully
appreciate
the
desire
of
our
protestant
to
hallow
secular
instruction
but
the
reading
of
the
scriptures
as
a
public
ceremony
is
as
distinctive
to
them
as
the
celebration
of
mass
would
be
to
catholics
no
one
can
evade
the
argument
which
forces
this
conclusion
schemes
are
glass
the
very
sun
shines
through
and
yet
it
is
not
a
little
remarkable
how
slowly
the
light
breaks
in
upon
the
seat
of
the
delusion
it
is
a
satisfaction
however
to
note
the
few
acknowledgments
tardy
and
incomplete
as
they
are
of
the
principle
which
we
have
always
maintained
prof
swing
alluding
to
the
action
of
the
chicago
school
board
to
which
we
have
referred
gives
voice
to
the
following
observations
of
common
sense
government
has
no
more
right
to
teach
the
bible
than
it
has
to
teach
the
koran
my
idea
is
that
the
government
did
in
its
earlier
life
run
according
to
a
sort
of
christian
common
law
but
now
the
number
of
jews
catholics
and
infidels
has
become
so
greatly
increased
the
government
has
to
base
itself
squarely
upon
its
constitutional
idea
that
all
men
are
religiously
equal
even
if
the
genius
of
the
country
permitted
the
teaching
of
the
bible
i
should
doubt
the
propriety
of
continuing
the
custom
because
no
valuable
moral
results
can
ever
come
from
reading
a
few
verses
hurriedly
in
a
and
social
strifes
will
be
continually
springing
up
out
of
the
the
government
then
according
to
the
professor
has
no
rights
in
the
spiritual
domain
a
proposition
which
we
have
been
condemned
to
universal
derision
for
maintaining
and
yet
one
that
is
to
any
person
who
will
pause
for
a
moment
to
consider
our
institutions
an
ardent
advocate
of
what
are
called
liberal
principles
commenting
upon
the
position
of
prof
swing
very
properly
styles
it
the
only
one
defensible
the
purpose
of
the
liberal
league
is
unquestionably
to
procure
the
complete
secularization
of
our
public
schools
which
would
of
course
be
as
unjust
towards
catholic
as
any
other
system
this
class
is
no
less
hostile
to
justice
and
true
liberty
than
any
other
set
of
meddlers
nevertheless
it
is
not
a
little
amusing
to
see
the
unmistakable
fear
with
which
it
regards
the
issue
of
the
present
policy
it
waves
as
its
flag
of
hostility
to
the
catholics
the
threadbare
pretext
that
we
are
secretly
opposed
to
all
education
it
is
not
necessary
for
us
to
repeat
the
indignant
denial
and
protest
with
which
we
have
ever
met
this
gratuitous
calumny
we
quote
from
the
boston
of
system
is
in
the
greatest
danger
not
so
much
from
the
fact
that
it
is
openly
attacked
from
without
by
the
catholics
as
from
the
fact
that
a
great
inherent
injustice
to
all
is
made
part
and
parcel
of
it
by
its
distinctively
protestant
character
what
is
built
on
wrong
is
built
on
the
sand
and
our
school
system
will
certainly
fall
in
ruins
by
and
by
unless
it
can
be
grounded
on
equal
justice
to
when
the
avowed
heathen
who
reap
the
fullest
harvest
fear
for
the
destruction
of
our
present
unjust
system
of
education
on
the
ground
that
it
is
too
iniquitous
to
last
is
it
not
time
for
people
who
call
themselves
christians
to
give
a
heed
to
the
petition
which
we
have
for
years
addressed
to
them
as
most
advantageous
to
all
of
us
and
as
doing
injustice
to
none
it
appears
however
that
this
idea
has
infiltrated
into
other
minds
a
methodist
journal
quoted
by
the
liberal
paper
to
which
we
have
referred
says
state
deals
only
with
temporal
affairs
and
does
not
attempt
to
usurp
spiritual
functions
therefore
the
objects
and
methods
of
public
education
are
wholly
secular
but
by
no
means
necessarily
or
at
all
immoral
or
irreligious
on
the
contrary
they
are
decidedly
favorable
to
piety
and
morality
but
composed
denominationally
as
the
american
people
is
the
state
ought
not
to
impart
religious
education
the
moment
such
an
attempt
should
be
made
the
community
would
be
in
conflict
as
to
what
form
it
should
take
it
may
be
conceded
without
danger
perhaps
that
the
state
should
not
teach
ethics
except
so
far
as
the
great
fundamental
principles
of
morals
and
politics
as
to
which
all
americans
are
agreed
are
concerned
religious
education
of
children
may
and
should
be
remitted
to
the
family
the
and
the
the
natural
and
guardians
of
religion
and
in
the
face
of
this
growing
acknowledgment
of
the
character
of
our
public
schools
and
knowing
that
they
must
give
religious
instruction
or
else
be
and
atheistical
we
are
pleased
to
hear
the
demand
that
the
state
nor
nation
nor
both
combined
shall
support
such
schools
the
fact
is
that
a
people
can
not
wholly
escape
from
its
national
traditions
without
forgetting
its
language
or
undergoing
some
violent
revolution
if
our
will
study
the
meaning
of
the
terms
which
they
habitually
use
they
will
not
lose
their
traditions
of
freedom
and
equal
rights
nor
will
they
throw
themselves
into
a
violent
perilous
departure
from
them
but
we
hasten
to
comment
upon
another
sentence
which
is
frequently
quoted
from
the
oration
the
matter
of
religion
to
the
family
altar
the
church
and
the
private
school
supported
by
private
precisely
so
if
it
must
come
to
this
if
no
arrangement
can
be
made
by
which
religion
and
morality
can
be
taught
in
the
public
schools
then
leave
the
matter
to
the
family
altar
and
the
church
and
allow
it
to
be
done
by
private
contributions
in
other
words
either
furnish
the
people
with
that
which
you
pretend
to
tax
them
for
a
fair
and
equitable
system
of
public
schools
or
allow
them
to
provide
for
themselves
but
whatever
you
do
keep
your
hands
off
the
sacredness
of
the
do
not
set
foot
into
the
hallowed
precincts
of
the
domestic
sanctuary
the
family
though
subordinate
is
not
to
be
violated
by
the
state
parents
have
rights
which
no
government
can
usurp
you
have
no
more
right
to
force
the
education
of
their
children
out
of
their
hands
than
to
define
the
number
of
offspring
by
law
you
have
no
more
right
to
establish
a
system
to
which
you
will
endeavor
to
secure
their
conformity
by
violent
measures
than
you
have
to
establish
public
or
require
that
voters
shall
be
brought
up
on
government
pap
and
be
fed
out
of
a
government
spoon
keep
from
meddling
with
religion
you
have
no
authority
to
teach
it
what
a
bitter
rebuke
these
words
of
the
president
contain
for
that
party
small
and
contemptible
in
itself
but
powerful
by
reason
of
the
times
which
has
ever
sought
to
widen
the
gulf
between
us
and
our
countrymen
it
is
not
enough
that
we
should
be
estranged
by
the
traditions
of
three
hundred
years
it
is
not
enough
to
whisper
into
the
popular
ear
every
stale
and
loathed
calumny
it
is
not
enough
to
bring
our
holiest
rites
and
beliefs
into
the
obscene
literature
now
circulating
amongst
the
depraved
youth
of
our
country
it
is
not
enough
to
drown
with
a
thousand
noisy
insolent
tongues
every
attempt
we
make
at
explanation
it
is
not
enough
for
this
malignant
persecuting
power
to
drop
its
poison
into
every
crevice
of
our
social
and
religious
system
from
the
parlor
to
the
sewer
from
the
temple
to
the
lupanar
but
the
nation
must
be
organized
against
us
our
religion
must
in
some
way
or
other
be
dragged
into
politics
for
shame
we
cry
with
the
president
in
a
country
of
such
varied
religious
beliefs
as
ours
there
is
but
one
way
to
order
and
peace
the
church
and
the
state
for
ever
to
sum
up
we
agree
with
the
president
no
in
our
common
schools
and
therefore
one
to
our
present
system
of
schools
because
they
are
sectarian
one
to
schools
in
which
god
is
ignored
one
to
schools
in
which
god
is
denied
in
the
name
of
falsely
we
now
turn
to
consider
the
prophecy
in
which
the
president
warns
the
american
people
of
its
future
dangers
we
are
to
have
another
contest
in
the
near
future
of
our
national
existence
i
predict
that
the
dividing
line
will
not
be
mason
and
but
between
patriotism
and
intelligence
on
the
one
side
and
superstition
ambition
and
ignorance
on
the
what
is
meant
by
superstition
formerly
it
meant
seeking
for
power
or
knowledge
by
dealing
with
the
impure
spirits
does
the
president
mean
to
warn
us
against
the
delusions
and
uncleanness
of
modern
spiritism
if
so
we
are
agreed
but
we
do
not
really
suppose
that
the
president
means
any
such
thing
what
does
he
mean
we
find
in
the
dictionary
four
other
meanings
of
the
word
which
he
has
used
superstition
means
excessive
reverence
or
fear
of
that
which
is
unknown
or
but
we
observe
no
such
phenomenon
among
our
people
if
anything
rather
the
reverse
or
it
means
worship
of
false
we
see
no
signs
of
this
except
in
the
of
san
francisco
nor
do
we
behold
any
great
belief
the
agency
of
superior
powers
in
certain
extraordinary
or
singular
events
or
in
omens
or
nor
further
do
we
behold
any
nicety
or
scrupulous
exactness
as
an
alarming
feature
of
our
present
moral
condition
there
remains
but
one
meaning
and
this
we
are
persuaded
is
the
sense
which
the
president
intended
to
convey
an
ignorant
or
irrational
worship
of
the
supreme
an
ignorant
worship
of
god
is
one
which
knows
not
what
to
believe
concerning
him
or
one
which
is
unable
to
state
what
it
does
believe
or
further
one
which
can
give
no
conclusive
reason
for
believing
anything
but
outside
the
catholic
church
there
is
no
religious
body
which
can
tell
precisely
what
it
ought
to
believe
or
precisely
what
it
does
believe
or
precisely
why
it
ought
to
believe
anything
again
an
irrational
belief
in
god
is
one
which
recognizes
his
existence
and
at
the
same
time
denies
his
attributes
for
instance
it
is
an
irrational
belief
in
god
which
denies
his
wisdom
which
asserts
that
he
has
not
chosen
means
adequate
to
accomplish
his
ends
which
represents
him
when
he
has
made
a
revelation
to
man
as
leaving
his
divine
truth
in
scattered
and
mysterious
writings
in
an
obscure
language
requiring
men
to
find
them
collect
them
and
believe
their
true
meaning
in
order
to
be
saved
or
which
fancies
that
reading
daily
a
few
pages
from
these
writings
to
little
children
will
be
sufficient
to
prepare
them
for
the
duties
of
life
it
is
an
irrational
belief
in
god
which
represents
him
as
immoral
as
creating
man
simply
to
damn
him
or
which
denies
his
justice
by
wickedly
imagining
that
he
will
not
punish
oppression
and
calumny
and
those
who
sow
discord
in
the
midst
of
a
free
and
happy
people
here
again
we
agree
with
the
president
in
denouncing
such
impiety
and
in
predicting
that
if
the
liberties
and
institutions
of
this
republic
are
soon
to
be
jeopardized
it
will
be
by
irreverence
towards
god
and
the
contempt
of
charity
and
justice
towards
men
ever
practised
by
this
and
irrational
worship
of
the
supreme
another
item
of
danger
which
the
president
foresees
in
the
near
future
is
here
again
we
find
him
sounding
the
note
of
warning
to
which
we
have
always
given
voice
his
excellency
says
a
republic
like
ours
where
no
power
is
exercised
except
by
the
will
of
the
people
it
is
important
that
the
sovereign
the
people
should
foster
intelligence
that
intelligence
which
is
to
preserve
us
as
a
free
the
liberties
of
this
republic
will
not
be
maintained
we
say
by
an
ignorant
debauched
and
corrupted
generation
our
common
people
must
be
educated
they
must
possess
intelligence
which
is
to
preserve
us
as
a
free
they
must
know
something
more
than
simply
how
to
read
and
write
and
nor
will
it
be
sufficient
to
add
to
this
a
knowledge
of
music
they
must
have
a
sound
and
thorough
moral
training
their
conscientious
convictions
must
be
grounded
on
truth
daily
taught
and
daily
enforced
they
must
be
daily
taught
to
control
their
passions
they
must
be
taught
honesty
and
be
required
to
give
back
that
which
is
unjustly
gotten
they
must
be
taught
the
true
purpose
of
life
but
this
training
as
the
president
affirms
belongs
not
to
the
state
but
to
the
altar
and
the
either
assist
families
and
churches
or
else
encourage
them
to
help
themselves
these
are
our
sentiments
but
when
sectarian
bigotry
has
gotten
hold
of
a
system
of
the
falsely
schools
and
with
obstinate
purpose
and
clamorous
intensity
and
declamation
manifests
its
resolve
to
maintain
this
system
even
though
it
conflicts
with
the
conscientious
rights
of
millions
of
the
people
of
our
country
when
further
it
is
determined
to
force
a
large
minority
to
accept
this
state
of
things
or
to
go
without
instruction
we
as
american
citizens
denounce
the
system
as
tyrannous
in
the
full
sense
of
the
word
as
a
reckless
and
immoral
oppression
we
assert
that
those
who
uphold
it
do
not
desire
intelligence
but
prefer
ignorance
that
their
aim
is
not
to
promote
knowledge
but
to
destroy
the
religious
convictions
of
our
children
and
to
keep
us
from
growing
in
the
land
we
affirm
that
such
originates
in
ignorance
is
perpetuated
by
ignorance
tends
to
still
deeper
degradation
of
ignorance
and
we
predict
that
it
will
bring
forth
the
fruits
of
ignorance
not
only
in
morality
but
in
the
lower
sciences
we
for
our
part
will
never
relax
our
efforts
to
show
up
the
dishonesty
of
this
party
we
will
never
withdraw
our
protest
until
justice
has
been
done
and
knowing
to
what
lengths
men
can
go
when
they
start
without
principle
we
fully
share
in
the
alarm
of
our
chief
magistrate
as
to
the
danger
of
have
we
not
therefore
reason
to
hope
that
in
the
midst
of
the
struggle
which
his
sagacious
mind
perceives
to
be
at
hand
we
shall
find
him
on
the
side
of
patriotism
and
intelligence
with
all
true
americans
against
that
and
whose
aim
is
to
destroy
the
of
unfettered
religious
sentiments
and
equal
of
his
there
is
another
item
of
the
future
contest
which
according
to
our
president
is
what
is
ambition
a
man
has
been
elected
to
the
highest
office
in
the
gift
of
a
free
people
the
limits
of
which
have
been
fixed
by
a
custom
handed
down
by
the
fathers
of
the
nation
and
which
to
the
minds
of
true
patriots
has
the
force
of
law
when
such
a
trust
does
not
satisfy
the
honored
recipient
and
he
yielding
to
personal
motives
strains
every
nerve
and
seeks
by
every
means
at
his
command
to
break
down
all
barriers
to
continuation
of
power
thereby
abusing
the
dignity
of
his
post
and
the
confidence
of
the
people
that
is
ambition
we
do
not
fully
share
the
apprehension
with
which
the
president
foresees
this
threat
to
the
of
our
national
welfare
but
if
it
be
true
we
fully
agree
with
him
when
he
says
the
centennial
year
of
our
national
existence
i
believe
is
a
good
time
to
begin
the
work
of
strengthening
the
foundations
of
the
structure
commenced
by
our
patriotic
forefathers
one
hundred
years
ago
at
according
to
a
great
diplomatist
given
to
man
in
order
that
he
might
conceal
his
but
this
maxim
has
never
been
accepted
by
honorable
men
in
examining
thus
briefly
the
moines
speech
we
have
followed
that
other
canon
of
criticism
which
requires
that
words
shall
be
interpreted
in
their
literal
sense
as
far
as
possible
submitted
to
this
just
criticism
the
language
appears
to
us
immortal
and
worthy
of
the
high
place
which
is
even
now
being
prepared
for
it
some
may
marvel
and
may
wonder
how
the
president
came
to
be
filled
with
so
high
a
degree
of
the
prophetic
spirit
like
balaam
the
son
of
beor
he
was
expected
to
curse
us
unlike
balaam
he
was
not
stayed
but
rather
urged
on
by
the
faithful
servant
with
whom
he
previously
conversed
but
there
is
no
mystery
about
it
he
has
grown
up
with
the
instincts
of
a
true
american
and
he
has
spoken
accordingly
not
only
are
the
words
on
which
we
have
commented
true
but
they
are
in
accordance
with
sound
catholic
principles
we
are
ready
to
take
him
at
his
word
and
his
words
in
their
true
meaning
to
those
who
will
join
us
we
say
without
disguise
or
reserve
you
will
never
regret
having
trusted
us
and
dealt
fairly
with
us
according
to
the
laws
and
constitution
of
this
we
believe
with
the
president
that
if
the
only
honest
meaning
of
his
language
be
as
honestly
carried
out
battles
which
created
the
army
of
the
which
by
the
way
a
catholic
general
once
commanded
and
in
whose
ranks
hundreds
of
catholic
hearts
bled
we
believe
we
say
that
these
battles
not
have
been
fought
in
the
children
of
the
soldiers
of
the
union
will
at
least
be
the
peers
of
those
whom
their
fathers
overcame
the
heroes
will
not
look
down
to
see
their
heirs
defrauded
of
equal
rights
in
union
and
the
free
institutions
for
which
they
the
president
will
yield
to
his
comrades
in
arms
at
least
as
much
as
he
is
so
ready
to
accord
to
his
late
opponents
and
as
for
our
countrymen
throughout
the
union
we
are
prepared
to
wait
trusting
that
when
fully
enlightened
they
will
agree
to
our
obtaining
independently
of
all
political
agitations
or
party
organizations
our
just
and
equal
rights

american
citizens

christmas
morn
a
message
is
there
anything
more
tantalizing
than
to
be
caught
with
a
toothache
and
swelled
face
just
at
christmas
time
when
hands
are
full
of
work
that
must
be
finished
of
plans
that
have
been
begun
in
time
and
carried
on
prosperously
to
within
a
few
days
of
their
fulfilment
this
is
just
what
befell
stephen
walpole
on
the
of
december
in
the
year
of
grace
you
remember
what
a
terrific
winter
that
was
how
the
bleak
north
wind
blew
over
ice
and
snow
and
added
tenfold
horrors
to
the
poor
soldiers
fighting
in
that
terrible
war
how
all
our
hearts
shuddered
in
pity
for
them
as
we
sat
stitching
and
knitting
in
their
service
by
the
glow
of
our
christmas
fires
this
of
december
was
perhaps
the
bitterest
day
of
the
whole
season
the
snow
was
deep
on
the
ground
the
ice
hung
in
long
spikes
from
rails
and
roofs
and
the
east
wind
blew
cruelly
over
all
stephen
walpole
ought
to
have
been
out
breasting
it
but
instead
of
this
he
sat
at
home
moaning
in
a
voice
that
sounded
like
a
at
sea
through
poultices
wadding
and
miles
of
flannel
that
swelled
his
head
out
of
all
human
proportions
think
of
a
man
being
knocked
down
by
a
thing
no
bigger
than
a
point
he
grumbled
prick
of
that
miserable
atom
one
calls
a
nerve
turns
the
seat
of
intellect
into
a
monster
head
and
makes
one
a
spectacle
to
gods
and
men
i
could
whip
myself
for
being
such
a
milksop
as
to
knock
under
to
it
rather
have
every
tooth
in
my
head
pulled
out
than
play
the
woman
like
och
whew
you
right
sir
for
your
impertinence
protested
nelly
walpole
bridling
up
and
applying
a
fresh
hot
poultice
to
her
cheek
which
she
bade
him
hold
but
stephen
in
his
manly
inability
to
bear
the
toothache
with
composure
dropped
the
soft
mess
under
a
sudden
sting
that
jerked
it
out
of
his
hand
an
unmanageable
baby
it
is
cried
nelly
catching
the
poultice
in
time
to
save
her
pretty
violet
cashmere
dress
told
you
to
hold
your
cheek
while
i
fastened
the
bandage
make
haste
now
before
it
my
unfortunate
brother
man
is
this
how
i
find
you
bound
and
poulticed
in
the
hands
of
the
philistines
this
was
from
marmaduke
younger
brother
who
entered
while
the
operation
was
going
on
and
stood
surveying
the
victim
in
serene
compassion
cried
stephen
all
the
pity
a
poor
devil
gets
is
being
bullied
for
not
holding
his
come
not
so
bad
since
vice
enough
in
you
for
a
pun
said
marmaduke
did
you
catch
the
thing
thing
the
pun
caught
me
said
stephen
resentfully
it
caught
you
in
some
of
those
villanous
places
where
you
go
pottering
after
beggars
and
blackguards
and
the
lord
knows
what
said
marmaduke
with
airy
contempt
drawing
his
slim
beringed
fingers
gracefully
through
a
mass
of
remarkably
fine
curls
that
clustered
over
his
high
white
forehead
and
gave
a
boyish
look
to
his
handsome
young
face
and
added
to
its
attractions
he
was
extremely
prepossessing
this
perfumed
young
gentleman
of
you
could
not
look
at
him
without
liking
him
his
eye
was
as
clear
as
a
his
smile
as
frank
his
laughter
as
joyous
and
catching
yet
as
it
sometimes
happens
with
the
graces
of
childhood
these
things
were
a
deceptive
promise
the
frankness
and
the
joy
were
genuine
but
there
was
a
cold
gleam
of
contempt
a
cold
ring
of
selfishness
in
the
bright
eyes
and
the
merry
voice
that
were
very
disappointing
when
you
found
them
out
but
people
were
slow
to
find
them
out
even
those
who
lived
with
marmaduke
and
thus
had
ample
opportunities
of
judging
remained
under
the
spell
of
his
attractive
manners
and
personal
charms
until
some
accident
revealed
their
worthlessness
a
false
coin
will
go
on
passing
current
through
many
hands
until
one
day
some
one
drops
it
to
the
ground
and
the
glittering
sham
is
betrayed
he
had
not
a
bad
heart
he
was
kind
even
when
he
could
be
brought
to
forget
himself
for
a
moment
and
think
of
others
but
it
required
a
shock
to
do
this
and
shocks
are
happily
rare
in
life
so
marmaduke
slept
on
undisturbed
in
his
egotism
hardening
unconsciously
in
enjoyment
he
had
never
taken
trouble
about
anything
made
a
genuine
effort
of
any
sort
except
for
his
amusement
he
had
just
the
kind
of
brains
to
enable
him
to
get
through
college
with
a
decent
amount
of
success
easily
tact
ready
repartee
a
quick
retentive
memory
that
gave
the
maximum
of
result
for
the
minimum
of
work
he
would
pass
for
clever
and
well
informed
where
an
awkward
ugly
youth
who
had
ten
times
his
intellect
and
studied
ten
times
harder
would
pass
for
knowing
nothing
stephen
was
eight
years
older
than
he
and
had
not
yet
discovered
his
real
value
perhaps
this
arose
partly
from
not
being
of
a
particularly
observant
or
analytical
turn
of
mind
he
took
people
pretty
much
at
their
own
valuation
as
the
world
is
rather
apt
to
do
marmaduke
set
a
very
high
price
on
his
handsome
face
and
limited
attainments
and
his
brother
had
never
dreamed
of
disputing
it
he
would
sometimes
naïvely
express
his
surprise
that
people
were
so
fond
of
duke
when
he
did
so
little
to
please
them
and
wonder
how
popular
he
was
considering
that
he
never
gave
himself
the
smallest
trouble
to
oblige
or
humor
people
suppose
his
handsome
face
that
mankind
and
womankind
in
particular
find
so
taking
stephen
would
remark
to
nelly
certainly
has
a
wonderful
knack
for
getting
on
with
people
without
caring
twopence
whether
they
like
him
or
not
i
wish
i
knew
his
secret
perhaps
his
high
nelly
would
sometimes
suggest
that
fine
temper
might
count
for
something
in
the
mystery
and
stephen
never
contradicted
her
his
temper
was
not
his
best
point
he
had
a
heart
of
gold
he
had
energy
patience
and
endurance
to
any
extent
except
in
case
of
toothache
he
was
unselfish
and
generous
but
he
was
sensitive
and
exacting
like
most
persons
who
dispense
liberally
he
was
impatient
of
the
selfishness
and
ingratitude
of
men
who
take
all
they
can
get
and
return
nothing
marmaduke
had
no
such
accounts
to
square
with
human
beings
so
he
never
felt
aggrieved
never
quarrelled
with
them
stephen
was
working
hard
at
his
profession
he
was
an
engineer
and
so
far
he
had
achieved
but
moderate
success
marmaduke
had
been
called
to
the
bar
but
it
was
a
mere
formality
so
far
he
spent
his
time
dawdling
about
town
retailing
gossip
and
reading
poetry
waiting
for
briefs
that
never
came
that
never
do
come
to
handsome
young
gentlemen
who
take
it
so
easy
his
elder
brother
laid
no
blame
on
him
for
this
want
of
success
he
was
busy
all
day
himself
and
took
for
granted
that
marmaduke
was
busy
on
his
side
the
law
was
work
besides
the
cleverest
and
most
industrious
men
grew
gray
in
its
service
before
they
made
a
name
for
themselves
and
duke
was
after
all
but
a
boy
he
had
time
enough
before
him
so
stephen
argued
in
his
brotherly
indulgence
in
ignorance
of
the
real
state
of
things
nelly
was
as
yet
the
only
person
who
had
found
out
marmaduke
who
knew
him
thoroughly
she
knew
him
egotistical
to
the
core
averse
to
work
to
effort
of
every
sort
idle
extravagant
and
the
knowledge
of
all
this
afforded
much
anxious
thought
to
her
little
head
of
nineteen
years
they
lived
alone
these
three
nelly
was
a
mother
to
the
two
young
men
watching
and
caring
for
them
with
that
instinctive
that
is
so
touching
in
young
girls
sometimes
she
was
a
spirited
elfin
little
creature
very
pretty
blessed
with
the
sweetest
of
tempers
the
shrewdest
of
common
sense
and
an
energy
of
character
that
nothing
daunted
and
few
things
resisted
marmaduke
described
this
trait
of
in
fashion
as
will
of
her
he
knew
his
was
no
match
for
it
and
with
a
tact
which
made
one
of
his
best
weapons
of
defence
he
contrived
to
avoid
clashing
with
it
this
was
not
all
policy
he
loved
his
pretty
sister
and
admired
her
more
than
anything
in
the
world
except
himself
and
yet
he
knew
that
this
admiration
was
not
mutual
that
nelly
knew
him
thoroughly
saw
through
him
as
if
he
were
glass
but
he
was
not
afraid
of
her
his
elder
brother
was
duped
by
him
but
he
would
have
staked
his
life
on
it
that
nelly
would
never
undeceive
him
that
she
would
let
stephen
go
on
believing
in
him
so
long
as
the
deceiver
himself
did
not
tear
off
the
mask
yet
it
was
a
source
of
bitter
anxiety
to
the
wise
little
to
watch
marmy
drifting
on
in
this
life
of
indolence
and
vacuity
where
was
it
to
end
where
do
such
lives
always
end
nothing
but
some
terrible
shock
could
awake
him
from
it
and
where
was
the
shock
to
come
from
nelly
never
preached
she
was
far
too
sensible
for
that
but
when
the
opportunity
presented
itself
she
would
say
a
few
brief
words
to
the
culprit
in
an
earnest
way
that
never
irritated
him
if
they
worked
no
better
result
he
would
admit
with
exasperating
that
he
was
a
dog
that
he
was
unworthy
of
such
a
perfection
of
a
sister
and
such
an
irreproachable
elder
brother
but
that
as
nature
had
so
blessed
him
he
meant
to
take
advantage
of
the
privilege
of
leaving
the
care
of
his
perfection
to
them
i
were
alone
on
my
own
hook
nell
i
would
work
like
a
he
protested
once
to
her
gentle
upbraiding
as
it
is
why
need
i
bother
myself
you
will
save
my
soul
and
pray
me
high
and
dry
into
heaven
and
stephen
stephen
the
admirable
the
unimpeachable
the
pink
of
respectability
will
keep
me
out
of
mischief
in
believe
in
vicarious
salvation
for
this
world
or
the
next
and
neither
do
you
marmy
you
are
much
too
intelligent
to
believe
in
any
such
absurdity
replied
nelly
handing
him
a
glove
she
had
been
sewing
a
button
into
marmaduke
did
not
contradict
her
but
whistling
an
air
from
the
arranged
his
hat
becomingly
a
little
to
one
side
and
with
a
farewell
look
in
the
glass
over
the
sauntered
out
for
his
morning
constitutional
in
the
park
nelly
went
to
the
window
and
watched
the
lithe
young
figure
with
its
elastic
step
until
it
disappeared
she
was
conscious
of
a
stronger
solicitude
about
marmaduke
this
morning
than
she
had
ever
felt
before
it
was
like
a
presentiment
yet
there
was
nothing
that
she
knew
of
to
justify
it
he
had
not
taken
to
more
irregular
hours
nor
more
extravagant
habits
nor
done
anything
to
cause
her
fresh
anxiety
still
her
heart
beat
as
under
some
new
and
sudden
fear
perhaps
it
was
the
ring
of
false
logic
in
his
argument
that
sounded
a
louder
note
of
alarm
and
warned
her
of
worse
danger
than
she
had
suspected
one
might
fear
everything
for
a
man
starting
in
life
with
the
deliberate
purpose
of
shifting
his
responsibility
on
to
another
setting
his
conscience
to
sleep
because
he
had
two
brave
wakeful
ones
watching
at
his
side
something
would
but
come
and
wake
him
up
to
see
the
monstrous
folly
the
sinfulness
of
it
sighed
nelly
nothing
short
of
a
miracle
could
do
that
i
believe
he
might
indeed
fall
ill
and
be
brought
to
door
he
might
break
his
leg
and
be
a
cripple
for
life
and
that
might
serve
the
purpose
but
oh
dear
not
brave
enough
to
wish
for
so
severe
a
two
months
had
passed
since
this
little
incident
between
the
brother
and
sister
and
nothing
had
occurred
to
vindicate
gloomy
forebodings
marmaduke
rose
late
read
the
newspaper
then
tennyson
lamartine
or
the
last
novel
made
an
elaborate
toilet
and
sauntered
down
to
the
courts
to
keep
a
lookout
for
the
coming
briefs
but
it
was
near
christmas
now
and
this
serious
and
even
tenor
of
life
had
been
of
late
broken
in
upon
by
the
getting
up
of
private
theatricals
in
company
with
some
bachelor
friends
what
between
learning
his
own
part
and
hearing
his
and
actresses
theirs
and
overseeing
stage
arrangements
marmaduke
had
a
hard
time
of
it
his
hands
were
full
he
was
less
at
home
than
usual
seldom
or
never
of
an
evening
he
had
come
in
very
late
some
nights
and
looked
worn
and
out
of
spirits
nelly
thought
when
he
came
down
to
his
late
breakfast
wish
those
theatricals
were
over
marmy
they
will
kill
you
if
they
last
much
longer
she
said
with
a
tender
anxious
look
on
her
pretty
little
face
this
was
the
day
he
came
home
and
found
stephen
in
the
hands
of
the
philistines
hard
work
enough
assented
the
young
man
stretching
out
his
long
limbs
wearily
the
will
soon
be
here
it
will
be
too
bad
if
you
are
laid
up
and
come
and
applaud
me
steevy
he
added
considering
his
elder
huge
head
that
looked
as
if
it
would
take
a
month
to
regain
its
natural
shape
the
least
of
my
troubles
boomed
stephen
through
his
poultice
eh
nell
i
can
tell
you
as
bad
as
any
toothache
the
labor
had
with
the
business
those
lazy
dogs
travers
and
milford
throwing
all
the
weight
of
it
on
me
under
pretext
of
never
having
done
that
sort
of
thing
always
the
fate
of
the
willing
horse
said
stephen
without
the
faintest
idea
of
being
sarcastic
just
what
i
complain
of
with
those
idle
fellows
x
and
w
they
throw
the
burden
of
all
the
business
on
me
because
forsooth
i
understand
things
better
i
do
understand
that
people
get
work
done
unless
they
bestir
themselves
and
attend
to
be
such
an
ass
as
to
let
myself
be
put
on
in
that
way
said
marmaduke
resentfully
would
not
be
fooled
into
doing
the
work
of
three
people
instead
of
yet
what
you
are
doing
at
present
replied
stephen
different
it
is
only
explained
marmaduke
then
you
see
you
nelly
had
it
on
the
tip
of
her
tongue
to
say
but
she
checked
herself
and
finished
the
sentence
for
him
with
is
not
the
same
thing
people
can
not
make
terms
for
a
division
of
labor
except
it
be
in
the
case
of
real
course
not
assented
stephen
marmaduke
looked
at
his
boots
and
inwardly
voted
nelly
end
of
a
did
she
guess
this
mental
vote
and
did
she
take
advantage
of
it
to
ask
him
a
favor
marmy
would
go
and
see
that
poor
man
for
you
stephen
she
said
in
the
most
natural
way
possible
without
looking
up
from
her
work
wish
he
would
i
should
be
ever
so
much
obliged
to
him
would
you
mind
it
duke
what
a
message
for
me
to
a
poor
fellow
that
i
wanted
badly
to
go
and
see
is
he
where
does
he
hang
out
name
is
john
baines
and
he
hangs
out
in
red
pepper
lane
ten
minutes
from
here
at
the
back
of
the
abominable
slum
no
locality
is
not
berkeley
square
or
piccadilly
but
it
would
not
kill
you
to
walk
through
it
once
rejoined
stephen
go
a
dear
boy
coaxed
nelly
fixing
her
bright
eyes
on
face
with
a
smile
that
would
have
fascinated
a
gorilla
marmaduke
rose
stretched
his
arms
as
if
to
brace
himself
for
an
effort
your
friend
john
baines
he
said
man
so
interesting
only
a
marmaduke
said
nothing
but
his
nose
uttered
such
an
unmistakable
that
nelly
in
spite
of
herself
burst
out
laughing
the
deuce
can
make
him
cultivate
such
company
he
exclaimed
appealing
to
nelly
and
joining
in
her
merriment
help
them
and
do
them
good
what
else
she
replied
man
to
his
taste
i
confess
i
have
none
for
evangelizing
men
or
indeed
men
of
any
station
kind
or
degree
observed
marmaduke
emphatically
you
go
said
stephen
say
i
i
mind
devoting
myself
for
once
to
oblige
you
your
message
for
john
baines
not
a
leg
of
mutton
or
a
bottle
of
port
i
bargain
for
carrying
that
sort
of
want
you
to
carry
anything
that
will
encumber
you
replied
the
elder
brother
him
i
can
not
get
to
see
him
and
why
and
that
i
am
very
sorry
for
it
meantime
you
can
say
i
have
done
his
commission
see
if
he
wants
anything
and
if
so
i
will
send
it
at
ails
him
enquired
marmaduke
with
a
sudden
look
of
alarm
hunger
and
cold
and
all
i
mean
not
a
case
of
typhus
or
i
should
not
care
to
imperil
my
valuable
life
by
running
in
the
way
of
that
sort
of
thing
observed
marmaduke
no
fear
the
complaint
is
not
catching
replied
his
brother
good
he
may
do
you
do
you
no
marmy
very
good
of
you
whispered
nelly
as
she
tripped
after
the
reluctant
messenger
and
helped
him
on
with
his
fur
coat
in
the
hall
not
a
bit
good
an
infernal
bore
and
only
doing
it
to
please
you
nell
protested
marmaduke
a
errand
it
is
i
know
from
adam
what
to
say
to
the
man
when
i
get
there
am
i
to
say
to
him
anything
suggested
nelly
you
have
come
to
see
him
because
stephen
is
ill
and
ask
him
how
he
is
never
at
a
loss
for
something
to
say
you
know
that
right
well
and
whatever
you
say
is
sure
to
be
i
know
who
talking
to
but
i
know
this
interesting
party
or
what
topics
of
conversation
he
particularly
affects
he
expect
me
to
preach
him
a
sermon
eh
and
marmaduke
faced
round
with
a
look
of
such
comical
terror
at
the
thought
that
nelly
again
burst
out
laughing
forbid
the
last
thing
you
need
dream
of
she
cried
is
much
more
likely
to
preach
to
indeed
but
i
bargain
for
that
i
would
very
much
rather
be
excused
protested
marmaduke
anything
but
reassured
foolish
boy
i
mean
that
he
will
preach
to
you
as
the
poor
always
do
by
example
by
their
patience
and
their
gratitude
for
the
least
thing
one
does
for
not
going
to
do
anything
for
john
baines
that
i
can
see
only
bothering
him
with
a
visit
which
he
would
very
likely
rather
i
spared
will
give
him
message
suggested
nelly
then
let
him
talk
there
is
nothing
poor
people
enjoy
so
much
as
a
good
listener
they
are
quite
happy
when
they
can
pour
out
their
grievances
into
a
willing
ear
the
sympathy
of
the
rich
is
often
a
greater
comfort
to
the
poor
than
their
lucky
anyhow
grunted
marmaduke
let
the
old
gentleman
have
his
head
listen
till
he
pulls
up
of
his
own
he
had
his
hand
on
the
when
muffled
tones
were
heard
calling
from
the
room
above
nelly
bounded
up
the
stairs
and
was
back
in
an
instant
says
you
are
to
give
baines
half
a
sovereign
from
him
he
had
nearly
forgotten
is
it
said
marmaduke
holding
out
his
hand
has
not
his
purse
about
him
so
he
begs
you
will
give
it
for
have
i
mine
said
the
young
man
run
up
for
it
or
shall
i
where
is
it
inquired
willing
nelly
marmaduke
hesitated
for
a
moment
and
then
said
abruptly
matter
where
it
is
nothing
in
have
you
done
with
your
money
you
had
plenty
a
few
days
ago
exclaimed
nelly
in
childlike
surprise
have
lost
it
i
a
brass
farthing
in
the
world
he
said
this
in
a
reckless
dogged
sort
of
way
as
if
he
did
not
care
who
knew
it
and
yet
he
spoke
in
an
undertone
for
one
moment
nelly
looked
at
him
in
blank
astonishment
it
she
repeated
and
then
the
truth
flashing
on
her
suddenly
she
cried
in
a
frightened
whisper
marmaduke
you
have
not
been
gambling
oh
tell
me
not
she
caught
hold
of
his
arm
and
clinging
to
it
looked
into
his
face
scared
and
white
nell
i
thought
you
were
a
girl
of
sense
he
exclaimed
pettishly
disengaging
himself
and
pushing
back
the
bolt
me
be
off
tell
stephen
i
had
not
change
so
his
friend
must
wait
till
he
can
go
and
tip
him
no
he
may
be
hungry
poor
man
stay
i
think
i
have
ten
shillings
here
said
nelly
and
she
pulled
out
her
and
picked
four
from
the
promiscuous
heap
of
smaller
coins
these
i
will
tell
stephen
you
will
give
the
ten
her
hand
trembled
as
she
dropped
the
money
into
pocket
he
was
about
to
resist
but
there
was
something
peremptory
a
touch
of
that
will
of
her
own
in
her
manner
that
deterred
him
sorry
i
said
anything
about
it
i
should
not
if
i
thought
you
would
have
minded
it
so
much
he
observed
it
o
marmaduke
minded
your
taking
to
gambling
talk
nonsense
a
man
a
gambler
because
once
in
a
way
he
loses
a
and
with
this
he
brushed
past
her
and
closed
the
with
a
loud
bang
nelly
did
not
sit
down
on
one
of
the
hall
chairs
and
cry
she
felt
mightily
inclined
to
do
so
but
she
struggled
against
the
weakness
and
overcame
it
walking
quietly
up
the
stairs
she
hummed
a
few
bars
of
a
favorite
air
as
she
passed
the
door
of
and
went
on
to
her
own
room
on
the
story
above
but
even
here
safe
and
alone
the
tears
were
bravely
held
back
she
would
not
cry
she
would
not
be
seen
with
red
eyes
that
would
betray
her
brother
she
would
do
her
very
utmost
to
rescue
him
to
screen
him
even
now
while
she
is
wrestling
and
pleading
in
the
silence
of
her
own
room
let
us
follow
the
gambler
to
red
pepper
lane
marmaduke
had
described
the
place
accurately
when
he
called
it
an
abominable
slum
red
pepper
lane
was
one
of
those
dismal
frightful
dens
of
darkness
and
dirt
that
cower
at
the
back
of
so
many
of
our
wealthy
squares
and
streets
for
breeding
typhus
and
every
social
plague
that
desolates
great
cities
the
houses
were
so
high
and
the
lane
so
narrow
that
you
could
at
a
stretch
have
shaken
hands
across
from
window
to
window
there
was
a
rope
slung
down
the
alley
with
a
lantern
hanging
from
it
which
looked
more
like
a
decoration
or
a
sign
than
a
possible
luminary
for
the
glass
was
too
thickly
crusted
with
dirt
to
admit
of
the
strongest
light
piercing
it
in
the
middle
of
the
lane
was
a
gutter
in
which
a
few
ragged
begrimed
and
little
mortals
were
playing
in
the
dirty
snow
the
east
wind
whistled
through
the
dreary
tenements
with
a
sharp
pitiless
cry
the
sky
was
bright
outside
but
here
in
red
pepper
lane
its
brightness
did
not
penetrate
nothing
but
the
wind
could
enter
and
that
came
with
all
its
might
through
the
crannies
in
the
walls
through
the
rickety
doors
through
the
glazed
with
brown
paper
or
battered
old
hats
any
rag
that
could
be
spared
to
stuff
the
empty
panes
not
a
head
was
seen
anywhere
protruding
from
windows
or
doors
the
fierce
blast
kept
every
one
within
who
had
a
roof
to
cover
them
if
it
were
not
for
the
sooty
little
objects
disporting
themselves
in
the
gutter
the
lane
might
have
been
the
precincts
of
the
jail
so
deserted
and
silent
was
it
marmaduke
might
have
wandered
up
and
down
for
an
hour
without
meeting
any
one
whom
he
could
ask
to
direct
him
to
where
john
baines
lived
but
luckily
he
recognized
the
house
at
once
by
signal
of
an
old
broom
nailed
over
the
door
he
searched
for
a
knocker
or
a
bell
but
seeing
neither
he
sounded
a
loud
with
the
gold
knob
of
his
and
presently
a
voice
called
out
from
somewhere
to
the
latch
he
did
so
and
again
left
to
his
own
devices
he
followed
injunctions
and
went
straight
up
to
the
second
story
where
he
knocked
and
in
obedience
to
a
sharp
in
entered
the
gloom
of
the
lane
had
prepared
him
gradually
for
the
deeper
gloom
of
the
room
and
he
at
once
distinguished
a
person
whom
he
rightly
surmised
to
be
the
man
sitting
at
the
farther
end
near
the
wrapped
up
in
a
brown
blanket
with
his
feet
resting
on
the
as
if
he
were
toasting
them
if
he
was
it
was
in
imagination
for
there
was
no
fire
only
the
ghost
of
one
as
visible
in
a
mass
of
gray
ashes
and
they
did
not
look
as
if
even
a
glow
of
the
late
warmth
remained
in
them
he
had
his
back
to
the
door
and
when
it
opened
he
turned
his
head
in
that
direction
but
not
sufficiently
to
see
who
came
in
marmaduke
as
he
stood
on
the
threshold
took
in
the
surroundings
at
a
glance
there
was
a
bed
on
the
floor
in
one
corner
with
no
to
speak
of
the
blanket
being
just
now
in
requisition
as
a
cloak
a
table
and
two
chairs
an
unoccupied
one
and
the
one
baines
sat
in
a
bag
and
a
basket
were
flung
under
the
window
and
some
dingy
old
utensils
a
saucepan
kettle
lay
about
there
was
nothing
particularly
dreadful
in
the
scene
it
was
compared
with
many
such
rather
a
cheerful
one
on
the
whole
but
marmaduke
who
had
no
experience
of
the
dwellings
of
the
poor
thought
it
the
most
appalling
picture
of
misery
and
desolation
that
could
be
conceived
he
was
roused
from
the
stupor
of
horror
into
which
the
sudden
spectacle
had
thrown
him
by
hearing
the
figure
in
the
blanket
ask
rather
sharply
a
second
time
there
beg
your
pardon
said
marmaduke
advancing
within
a
step
of
the
chair
name
is
walpole
i
have
come
to
see
if
there
is
anything
i
can
do
for
you
anything
that
you
that
he
stammered
not
knowing
how
to
put
it
walpole
i
am
obliged
to
you
for
calling
sir
i
want
nothing
but
i
am
glad
to
see
you
it
is
very
kind
of
you
pray
take
a
chair
you
must
excuse
me
for
not
getting
up
my
leg
is
still
very
am
only
the
brother
of
the
walpole
whom
you
know
said
marmaduke
surprised
beyond
measure
at
the
good
address
of
the
man
brother
is
laid
up
with
a
violent
he
was
greatly
put
out
at
not
being
able
to
keep
his
appointment
with
you
this
afternoon
and
sent
me
to
see
how
you
were
getting
on
and
to
tell
you
he
had
done
something
that
you
commissioned
him
to
brother
is
extremely
kind
said
the
man
am
sorry
to
hear
he
is
ill
this
weather
is
trying
to
seem
to
be
a
severe
sufferer
from
it
remarked
marmaduke
he
had
opened
his
fur
coat
and
sat
back
in
the
rickety
chair
in
mortal
fear
all
the
while
that
it
would
go
to
smash
under
him
this
was
the
most
extraordinary
specimen
of
the
tribe
he
could
not
say
that
he
had
ever
known
for
he
had
never
known
one
in
his
life
but
that
he
could
have
imagined
he
spoke
like
an
educated
man
and
even
in
his
blanket
he
had
the
bearing
of
a
gentleman
if
it
were
not
for
his
swollen
nose
and
the
glare
of
his
red
which
were
decidedly
not
refined
there
was
nothing
in
his
appearance
to
indicate
that
he
belonged
to
the
very
dregs
of
human
society
it
was
impossible
to
say
how
old
he
was
but
you
saw
at
a
glance
that
he
was
more
broken
than
aged
i
am
suffering
rather
severely
just
now
he
replied
in
a
quiet
conversational
way
always
do
when
the
cold
sets
in
but
added
to
my
chronic
complaint
of
sciatica
i
slipped
on
the
ice
some
time
ago
and
sprained
my
left
foot
badly
your
brother
made
my
acquaintance
at
the
hospital
where
i
was
taken
to
have
it
set
has
it
been
set
right
i
get
about
easily
yet
but
it
will
be
all
right
by
and
and
then
dismissing
the
selfish
subject
he
said
am
distressed
sir
that
you
should
have
had
the
trouble
of
coming
to
such
a
place
as
this
pray
let
me
detain
you
in
no
hurry
replied
marmaduke
whose
interest
and
curiosity
were
more
and
more
excited
there
nothing
i
can
do
for
you
dismal
work
sitting
here
all
day
with
a
sprained
ankle
and
having
nothing
to
do
would
you
care
to
have
some
books
it
did
not
occur
to
him
to
ask
if
he
knew
how
to
read
he
would
as
soon
have
inquired
if
he
knew
how
to
speak
baines
looked
at
him
with
a
curious
expression
look
like
a
man
to
lend
books
to
do
i
he
said
not
much
in
common
between
books
and
a
as
much
i
should
say
as
there
is
between
some
men
and
rags
and
bones
retorted
marmaduke
meeting
the
eyes
with
a
responsive
question
in
his
own
baines
turned
away
with
a
short
laugh
perhaps
it
was
mere
accident
or
the
force
of
habit
that
made
him
look
up
at
the
space
over
the
but
there
was
something
in
the
deliberate
glance
that
made
marmaduke
follow
it
and
doing
so
he
saw
a
faded
but
originally
good
engraving
of
shakspere
hung
in
a
frame
against
the
wall
repressing
the
low
whistle
which
rose
involuntarily
to
his
lips
he
said
looking
at
the
portrait
have
a
likeness
of
shakspere
i
see
have
you
read
his
plays
and
acted
them
them
you
were
originally
on
the
stage
then
i
saw
at
once
that
you
were
not
what
you
seem
to
me
said
marmaduke
with
that
frankness
that
seemed
so
full
of
sympathy
and
was
so
misleading
though
never
less
so
perhaps
than
at
this
moment
it
be
disagreeable
to
you
to
tell
me
through
what
chapters
of
or
other
vicissitudes
you
came
to
be
in
the
position
where
i
now
see
you
the
man
was
silent
for
a
few
minutes
whether
he
was
too
deeply
offended
to
reply
at
once
or
whether
he
was
glancing
over
the
past
which
the
question
evoked
it
was
impossible
to
say
marmaduke
fancied
he
was
offended
and
vexed
with
himself
for
having
questioned
him
he
stood
up
and
laying
four
on
the
beg
your
pardon
if
i
seemed
impertinent
i
assure
you
i
did
not
mean
it
he
said
felt
interested
in
you
and
curious
to
know
something
more
of
you
but
i
had
no
right
to
put
questions
he
made
a
step
towards
the
door
but
baines
rousing
himself
arrested
him
by
a
sign
am
not
offended
he
said
saw
quite
well
what
made
you
ask
it
you
would
have
every
right
to
catechise
me
if
i
had
come
to
you
for
help
as
it
is
your
kindness
and
your
makes
a
claim
which
i
am
in
no
mind
to
dispute
if
you
mind
shivering
in
this
cold
place
for
half
an
hour
pray
sit
down
and
i
will
tell
you
my
story
i
have
not
a
cigar
to
offer
you
he
added
with
a
laugh
perhaps
you
affect
that
vice
do
indeed
very
considerably
said
marmaduke
and
pulling
out
a
handsome
he
handed
it
to
baines
and
invited
him
to
help
himself
the
hesitated
just
for
a
moment
and
then
yielding
to
the
instinct
of
his
took
one
not
an
amusing
story
he
began
when
they
had
sent
up
a
few
warm
puffs
from
their
fragrant
weeds
it
may
not
be
uninteresting
to
you
you
are
very
young
would
it
be
rude
to
ask
how
young
next
week
if
i
live
so
long
replied
marmaduke
i
was
just
that
age
when
i
took
the
fatal
turn
in
the
road
that
led
to
the
honorable
career
in
which
i
am
now
embarked
my
father
was
an
officer
in
the
line
he
had
no
fortune
to
speak
of
a
couple
of
thousand
pounds
left
him
by
an
aunt
was
all
the
capital
he
possessed
when
he
was
still
young
he
married
and
got
three
thousand
pounds
with
his
wife
i
was
their
only
child
my
father
died
when
i
was
ten
years
old
and
left
me
to
the
sole
care
of
my
mother
who
made
an
idol
of
me
and
spoiled
me
to
my
content
i
was
not
a
bad
boy
i
had
no
evil
propensities
and
i
was
not
deficient
in
brains
i
picked
up
things
with
little
or
no
effort
and
got
on
better
at
school
than
many
who
had
twice
the
brains
and
four
times
the
industry
i
was
passionately
fond
of
poetry
learned
pages
of
byron
and
shelley
by
heart
and
declaimed
with
a
good
deal
of
power
there
could
not
have
been
a
greater
curse
than
such
a
gift
to
a
boy
of
my
temperament
and
circumstances
when
i
left
school
i
went
to
oxford
my
poor
mother
strained
every
nerve
to
give
me
a
university
education
with
a
view
to
my
becoming
a
barrister
but
instead
of
repaying
her
sacrifices
by
working
hard
i
spent
the
greater
part
of
my
time
acting
i
became
infatuated
about
shakspere
and
took
to
private
theatricals
with
a
frenzy
of
enthusiasm
as
would
have
it
i
fell
in
with
a
set
of
fellows
who
were
like
myself
i
had
one
great
chum
named
hallam
who
was
stark
mad
about
it
and
encouraged
me
in
the
folly
to
the
utmost
i
soon
became
a
leading
star
in
this
line
i
was
sought
for
and
asked
out
by
everybody
in
the
place
until
my
head
got
completely
turned
and
i
fancied
i
had
only
to
walk
on
to
the
stage
to
take
place
and
achieve
fame
and
fortune
the
first
thing
that
roused
me
from
the
absurd
delusion
was
seeing
charles
kean
in
macbeth
i
felt
utterly
annihilated
under
the
superiority
of
his
acting
it
showed
me
in
an
instant
the
difference
there
is
between
ordinary
taste
and
talent
and
the
divine
afflatus
of
genius
and
yet
an
old
friend
who
happened
to
meet
me
in
the
theatre
that
night
assured
me
that
the
younger
kean
was
not
a
patch
upon
his
father
and
that
macready
outshone
the
elder
kean
i
went
back
to
oxford
a
crestfallen
man
and
for
a
time
took
refuge
from
my
disappointment
in
real
work
i
studied
hard
and
when
the
term
came
for
going
up
for
my
degree
i
was
confident
of
success
it
was
a
vain
confidence
of
course
i
had
only
given
myself
to
study
for
a
period
of
two
months
or
so
and
it
would
have
been
little
short
of
a
miracle
if
i
had
passed
my
mother
was
terribly
disappointed
the
sight
of
her
tears
cut
me
up
more
than
the
failure
on
my
own
account
and
i
determined
to
succeed
or
die
in
the
effort
if
she
consented
to
let
me
make
one
more
she
did
consent
and
i
succeeded
that
was
the
happiest
day
of
my
life
i
he
drew
a
long
breath
and
repeated
in
an
undertone
as
if
he
forgot
presence
and
were
speaking
aloud
to
himself
the
happiest
day
of
my
life
worked
very
hard
to
pull
up
for
lost
time
observed
marmaduke
time
yes
that
was
it
lost
time
said
baines
musing
then
he
continued
in
his
former
tone
poor
mother
was
very
happy
she
declared
i
had
repaid
her
amply
for
all
her
sacrifices
she
saw
me
already
at
the
top
of
my
profession
a
a
judge
the
chief
of
all
the
judges
seated
in
robes
on
the
woolsack
i
came
home
and
was
in
due
time
called
to
the
bar
i
was
then
just
we
lived
in
a
pretty
house
on
the
road
to
putney
but
my
mother
thought
it
now
desirable
to
move
into
london
that
i
might
have
an
office
in
some
central
neighborhood
where
my
clients
would
flow
in
and
out
conveniently
i
remember
that
i
strongly
opposed
the
plan
not
from
dislike
but
from
some
feeling
like
a
presentiment
a
dread
that
london
would
be
a
dangerous
place
for
me
and
that
i
was
taking
the
road
to
ruin
by
leaving
the
shelter
of
our
secluded
home
with
its
garden
and
trees
away
from
a
thousand
temptations
that
beset
a
young
man
in
the
great
city
but
my
heart
was
set
on
it
she
was
convinced
my
character
had
thoroughly
changed
that
i
had
broken
off
for
ever
from
old
habits
and
old
propensities
and
that
i
was
strong
enough
to
encounter
any
amount
of
temptation
without
risk
poor
mother
it
was
no
fault
of
hers
if
she
was
blinded
by
love
the
fault
was
all
mine
i
fed
her
with
false
hopes
and
then
i
betrayed
them
she
gave
in
so
far
to
my
wishes
as
to
consent
only
to
let
the
house
instead
of
selling
it
as
she
first
intended
so
that
our
removal
to
london
took
the
appearance
more
of
an
essay
than
a
permanent
arrangement
i
was
thankful
for
this
and
set
about
the
change
in
high
spirits
we
were
soon
comfortably
settled
in
a
very
small
house
in
wimpole
street
i
found
it
rather
like
a
after
our
airy
roomy
abode
in
the
suburbs
but
it
was
very
snug
and
my
mother
who
had
wonderful
taste
soon
made
it
bright
and
pretty
she
was
the
brightest
and
prettiest
thing
in
it
herself
people
used
to
take
her
for
my
elder
sister
when
she
took
me
to
parties
of
an
evening
i
was
very
proud
of
her
and
with
better
reason
than
she
was
of
he
paused
again
looking
up
at
the
shakspere
print
as
if
he
saw
his
likeness
there
the
sunken
red
eyes
moistened
as
he
gazed
on
it
is
a
great
blessing
to
have
a
good
mother
said
marmaduke
lost
mine
when
i
was
little
more
than
a
much
the
better
for
both
of
you
retorted
baines
bitterly
did
not
live
for
you
to
break
her
heart
and
then
eat
out
your
own
with
remorse
but
i
am
talking
wildly
you
would
no
doubt
have
been
a
blessing
to
her
you
would
have
worked
like
a
man
and
she
would
have
been
proud
of
you
to
the
end
it
was
not
so
with
me
i
was
never
fond
of
work
i
was
not
fond
of
it
then
indeed
what
i
did
was
not
worthy
of
being
called
work
at
all
i
moped
over
a
for
an
hour
or
so
in
the
morning
and
then
read
shakspere
or
some
other
favorite
poet
by
way
of
refreshing
myself
after
the
unpalatable
task
and
getting
it
out
of
my
head
as
quickly
as
possible
i
went
down
regularly
to
the
courts
but
as
i
had
no
legal
connection
and
nothing
in
myself
to
make
up
for
the
want
of
patronage
or
inspire
confidence
in
my
steadiness
and
abilities
the
attorneys
brought
me
no
business
and
as
i
was
too
lazy
and
perhaps
too
proud
to
stoop
to
court
them
i
began
to
feel
thoroughly
disgusted
with
the
profession
and
to
wish
i
had
never
entered
it
i
ceased
to
go
through
the
farce
of
my
of
a
morning
and
devoted
myself
entirely
to
my
dilettante
tastes
reading
poetry
and
occasionally
amusing
myself
with
writing
it
my
old
longing
for
the
stage
came
back
and
only
wanted
an
opportunity
to
break
out
actively
this
opportunity
was
not
far
off
my
mother
suspected
nothing
of
the
way
i
was
idling
my
time
she
knew
the
bar
was
work
and
was
satisfied
to
see
me
kept
waiting
a
few
years
before
i
became
famous
but
it
was
matter
of
surprise
to
her
that
i
never
got
a
brief
of
any
description
she
set
it
down
to
jealousy
on
the
part
of
my
rivals
at
the
courts
and
would
now
and
then
wax
wroth
against
them
wondering
what
expedient
could
be
devised
for
showing
up
the
corrupt
state
of
the
profession
and
forcing
my
enemies
to
recognize
my
superiority
as
it
deserved
laugh
at
her
and
think
her
a
fool
she
was
wise
on
every
subject
but
this
and
i
fear
i
must
have
counted
for
something
in
leading
her
to
such
ridiculous
conclusions
i
held
very
much
to
preserving
her
good
opinion
but
instead
of
striving
to
justify
it
by
working
on
to
the
fulfilment
of
her
motherly
ambition
i
took
to
cheating
her
first
tacitly
then
deliberately
and
cruelly
things
were
going
on
in
this
way
when
one
day
one
day
i
went
out
as
usual
in
the
afternoon
ostensibly
to
the
courts
but
really
to
kill
time
where
i
could
at
my
club
in
the
row
or
lounging
in
pall
mall
i
was
passing
the
army
and
navy
club
when
i
heard
a
voice
call
out
hamlet
this
was
the
name
i
went
by
at
oxford
on
account
of
my
success
in
the
part
glad
i
am
to
see
you
old
boy
the
very
man
been
on
the
i
cried
returning
his
friendly
grasp
and
declaring
how
delighted
i
was
to
see
him
been
beating
about
for
you
ever
since
i
came
to
town
ten
days
ago
he
said
wrote
to
your
old
address
but
the
letter
was
sent
back
to
me
where
have
you
migrated
to
and
what
are
you
doing
told
him
the
brief
history
of
my
existence
since
we
had
parted
at
oxford
he
to
enter
the
army
i
to
begin
my
course
of
at
the
temple
he
was
now
on
leave
he
had
just
come
from
the
north
where
his
regiment
was
quartered
and
he
was
in
high
spirits
at
the
prospect
of
his
holiday
i
asked
him
what
it
was
he
had
been
wanting
me
so
particularly
for
wanted
to
see
you
first
of
all
for
your
own
sake
old
boy
he
answered
heartily
in
the
next
place
i
want
you
badly
to
help
us
to
get
up
some
private
theatricals
at
the
duchess
of
b
after
easter
i
suppose
you
are
a
perfect
actor
a
garrick
and
charles
mathews
combined
by
this
time
you
have
had
plenty
of
practice
be
assured
him
that
i
had
not
played
since
the
last
time
he
and
i
had
brought
down
the
house
together
he
was
immensely
surprised
and
loudly
deplored
my
mistake
in
burying
such
a
talent
in
the
earth
he
called
me
a
conceited
idiot
to
have
let
myself
be
crushed
by
kean
and
vowed
a
training
from
a
professional
would
bring
me
out
a
better
actor
than
ever
kean
was
amateur
acting
was
all
very
well
but
the
finest
untaught
genius
ever
born
could
no
more
compete
successfully
with
a
man
who
had
gone
through
the
regular
professional
drill
than
a
civilian
could
with
a
trained
soldier
in
executing
a
military
manœuvre
told
you
before
and
i
tell
you
again
he
continued
as
arm
in
arm
we
paced
a
shady
alley
of
the
park
tell
you
that
if
you
went
on
the
stage
you
would
cut
out
the
best
actor
we
have
though
that
is
not
saying
much
for
a
more
miserable
ignorant
lot
of
drivelling
idiots
no
stage
ever
saw
caricaturing
the
drama
than
our
english
theatres
can
boast
at
this
heart
rose
high
and
my
vanity
swelled
out
like
a
tail
pluming
itself
in
this
luxurious
air
of
flattery
i
knew
hallam
meant
what
he
said
but
i
knew
that
he
was
a
young
fellow
not
at
all
competent
to
judge
dramatic
power
and
still
less
to
counsel
me
yet
such
is
the
intoxicating
effect
of
vanity
that
i
swallowed
his
praise
as
if
it
had
been
the
purest
wisdom
i
opened
my
whole
heart
to
him
told
him
how
insufferably
bored
i
was
at
the
bar
that
i
had
no
aptitude
for
it
that
i
was
wasting
my
time
waiting
for
briefs
that
never
came
i
did
not
explain
what
pains
i
took
to
prevent
their
coming
until
kindling
with
my
own
exaggerated
statement
as
i
went
on
i
ended
by
cursing
the
day
i
took
to
the
bar
and
declaring
that
if
it
were
not
for
my
mother
i
would
abandon
the
whole
thing
and
try
my
luck
on
the
stage
why
should
you
let
your
mother
stand
in
your
way
said
hallam
she
is
too
unreasonable
to
see
the
justice
of
the
case
why
then
well
i
for
the
life
of
me
see
why
your
happiness
and
fortune
should
be
sacrificed
to
was
not
a
bad
fellow
far
from
it
he
did
not
mean
to
play
the
advocate
i
am
certain
he
thought
he
was
giving
me
excellent
advice
using
his
superior
knowledge
of
the
world
for
my
benefit
but
he
was
a
fool
an
ignorant
silly
fool
such
men
as
friends
are
often
worse
than
knaves
if
he
had
proposed
anything
obviously
wicked
dishonest
or
unprincipled
i
should
have
scouted
it
indignantly
and
walked
off
in
contempt
but
he
argued
with
a
show
of
reason
in
a
tone
of
considerate
regard
for
my
wishes
and
feelings
that
deceived
and
disarmed
me
he
represented
to
me
the
folly
of
sticking
to
a
life
that
i
hated
and
that
i
had
next
to
no
chance
of
ever
succeeding
in
he
had
a
score
of
examples
at
his
ends
of
young
fellows
teeming
with
talent
patient
as
asses
and
hard
working
as
negroes
who
had
gone
for
the
bar
and
given
it
up
in
despair
my
mother
like
all
fond
mothers
naturally
expected
me
to
prove
an
exception
to
the
general
rule
and
to
turn
out
a
lord
chancellor
of
the
romantic
sort
rising
by
sheer
force
of
merit
without
patronage
without
money
without
any
of
the
essential
helps
by
the
power
of
my
unaided
genius
is
simply
bosh
my
dear
fellow
innocent
maternal
bosh
persisted
hallam
as
dangerous
as
any
poison
cut
the
bar
as
your
better
genius
prompts
you
to
do
and
take
to
your
true
calling
the
aught
i
know
i
may
have
lost
any
talent
i
had
i
replied
is
two
years
remember
since
i
acted
at
is
very
easily
ascertained
said
my
friend
will
take
a
part
in
these
theatricals
we
are
going
to
get
up
and
we
will
soon
see
whether
your
talent
has
evaporated
or
not
my
own
impression
is
that
it
will
come
out
stronger
than
ever
you
have
studied
and
you
have
seen
something
if
not
very
much
of
life
since
your
last
mother
has
a
horror
of
the
theatre
i
said
unwilling
to
yield
without
a
show
of
resistance
would
break
her
heart
to
see
me
take
to
the
if
you
succeed
hearts
are
never
broken
by
how
if
i
fail
are
sure
not
to
fail
he
urged
look
here
do
nothing
rashly
say
anything
about
this
business
until
you
have
tried
your
hand
at
it
in
private
we
have
not
settled
yet
what
the
play
is
to
be
they
left
it
to
me
to
select
and
i
will
choose
one
that
will
bring
out
your
powers
best
not
tragedy
that
never
was
your
line
in
my
opinion
at
any
rate
you
must
for
the
present
confine
yourself
to
light
parts
such
interrupted
him
in
high
dudgeon
if
not
tragic
nothing
i
exclaimed
one
who
ever
saw
me
in
hamlet
declared
they
had
never
seen
the
part
so
well
rendered
and
you
said
many
a
time
that
my
macbeth
for
an
amateur
and
i
will
say
it
again
if
you
like
protested
hallam
since
then
i
have
seen
real
mine
was
not
real
i
for
the
life
of
me
see
i
broke
in
get
so
infernally
huffy
said
hallam
shaking
my
arm
with
impatience
you
want
to
know
what
real
trained
professional
acting
is
you
must
go
abroad
and
see
how
the
actors
of
the
théâtre
français
for
instance
study
and
train
and
drill
if
you
will
start
with
the
english
notion
that
a
man
can
take
to
the
stage
as
he
does
to
the
saddle
give
up
the
plan
at
once
you
will
never
rise
above
an
amateur
but
to
come
back
to
our
present
purpose
we
will
select
a
part
to
suit
you
and
if
the
rehearsals
promise
a
genuine
success
as
i
have
not
a
doubt
they
will
we
will
invite
your
mother
to
come
and
see
you
and
she
will
be
so
proud
of
your
triumph
that
the
cause
will
be
dear
hallam
it
was
some
good
fairy
sent
you
in
my
way
assuredly
this
morning
i
cried
grasping
his
arm
in
delight
was
highly
elated
and
took
to
the
scheme
with
enthusiasm
we
spent
the
afternoon
discussing
it
it
was
settled
that
the
play
should
be
taming
of
the
the
part
of
benedict
would
suit
me
to
perfection
hallam
declared
and
i
was
so
subdued
by
the
amount
of
worldly
wisdom
and
general
knowledge
of
life
which
he
had
displayed
in
his
arguments
about
my
change
of
profession
that
i
yielded
without
difficulty
and
consented
to
forego
tragedy
for
the
present
the
next
week
i
was
in
a
whirl
of
excitement
he
took
me
to
the
army
and
navy
club
and
introduced
me
to
a
number
of
swells
all
military
men
who
were
very
agreeable
and
treated
me
with
a
cordiality
that
charmed
me
i
fancied
life
must
be
a
delightful
thing
in
such
pleasant
company
that
i
was
now
in
my
proper
sphere
and
that
i
had
been
hitherto
out
of
place
amidst
rusty
lawyers
and
clerks
etc
in
fact
i
was
a
fool
and
my
head
got
turned
i
spent
all
my
time
in
the
day
lounging
about
with
hallam
and
his
aristocratic
captains
and
colonels
and
the
evenings
i
devoted
to
the
business
of
rehearsal
which
was
carried
on
at
lady
arabella
the
married
daughter
of
the
duchess
at
whose
house
the
theatricals
were
to
be
performed
i
had
been
very
graciously
received
by
her
grace
and
consequently
all
the
lords
and
ladies
who
composed
her
court
followed
suit
i
was
made
as
much
of
as
if
i
had
been
of
them
and
my
acting
soon
established
me
as
the
leading
star
of
the
select
company
i
suppose
hallam
was
right
in
saying
that
more
mature
reading
and
so
on
had
improved
my
dramatic
talent
for
certainly
it
came
out
with
a
brilliancy
that
surprised
myself
the
artistic
atmosphere
that
surrounded
me
seemed
to
infuse
fresh
vigor
into
me
i
borrowed
or
revealed
a
power
that
even
my
vanity
had
never
suspected
hallam
was
enchanted
and
as
proud
of
my
success
as
if
it
had
been
his
own
can
fancy
how
your
mother
will
enjoy
this
he
exclaimed
one
evening
as
i
walked
home
with
him
to
his
chambers
in
piccadilly
will
be
beside
herself
with
pride
in
you
old
fellow
fancy
what
it
will
be
the
night
of
your
first
public
representation
i
expect
a
seat
in
her
box
mind
was
just
two
days
before
the
grand
night
and
we
were
having
our
last
rehearsal
the
final
one
in
the
theatre
at
b
house
which
was
lighted
up
and
filled
with
a
select
few
in
order
to
judge
of
the
general
effect
for
the
following
night
i
was
in
great
spirits
and
acted
better
than
i
had
done
yet
the
audience
applauded
warmly
the
ladies
clapping
their
hands
and
shaking
their
handkerchiefs
that
filled
the
air
with
the
perfumes
of
arabia
while
the
gentlemen
more
audible
in
their
demonstrations
cheered
loudly
it
was
over
we
sat
down
to
supper
about
a
hundred
of
us
i
sat
next
the
duchess
and
my
beautiful
katharina
on
the
other
side
of
me
she
was
a
lovely
girl
of
twenty
a
cousin
of
the
duchess
i
had
been
struck
by
her
beauty
at
the
first
but
the
more
i
saw
of
her
the
less
she
pleased
me
she
was
a
vain
coquettish
young
lady
and
only
tolerated
me
because
i
was
useful
as
a
good
to
her
acting
which
to
be
just
was
excellent
i
never
saw
anything
so
good
off
the
stage
and
very
seldom
saw
it
equalled
even
there
flushed
with
her
recent
triumph
which
had
borrowed
additional
lustre
from
mine
she
was
more
gracious
and
conversational
than
i
had
yet
known
her
i
was
flattered
though
i
knew
perfectly
how
much
the
caprice
was
worth
and
i
exerted
myself
to
the
utmost
to
be
agreeable
we
were
altogether
a
very
merry
party
the
champagne
flowed
freely
and
with
it
the
spirits
of
the
guests
rose
to
sparkling
point
as
we
rose
from
the
table
some
one
called
out
for
a
dance
before
we
broke
up
the
musicians
had
gone
to
have
refreshments
after
the
rehearsal
but
they
were
still
in
the
house
the
duchess
a
person
who
always
agreed
with
everybody
all
round
at
once
ordered
them
in
people
began
to
engage
partners
and
all
was
laughing
confusion
round
the
i
turned
to
my
pretty
neighbor
and
asked
if
she
was
engaged
she
replied
laughing
that
being
neither
a
sibyl
nor
a
clairvoyant
she
could
not
have
known
beforehand
that
there
was
to
be
dancing
may
i
have
the
honor
of
claiming
you
for
the
first
dance
whatever
it
may
be
i
said
and
she
replied
that
i
might
i
offered
her
my
arm
and
we
took
our
way
back
into
the
theatre
which
was
still
brilliantly
illuminated
we
were
to
dance
on
the
stage
as
we
were
pushing
on
with
the
crowd
i
felt
a
strong
hand
laid
on
my
arm
and
before
i
had
time
to
prevent
it
lady
hand
was
withdrawn
and
the
intruder
stood
between
us
he
was
a
man
not
very
young
but
handsome
and
with
the
stamped
all
over
him
my
want
of
ceremony
he
said
in
an
easy
supercilious
tone
to
me
claim
the
first
dance
with
lady
what
grounds
i
demanded
stiffly
we
were
still
moving
on
carried
with
the
crowd
so
it
was
impossible
to
make
him
stand
aside
or
to
regain
my
post
next
lady
caroline
the
grounds
of
her
promise
he
replied
haughtily
caroline
uttered
a
laughing
lord
george
but
did
not
draw
away
the
hand
which
he
had
so
unceremoniously
transferred
from
my
arm
to
his
caroline
made
no
engagement
before
she
came
here
i
said
she
promised
this
dance
to
me
i
refer
you
to
herself
whether
this
be
true
or
are
not
in
the
habit
of
catechising
ladies
as
to
their
behavior
not
at
least
in
our
set
and
while
you
happen
to
be
in
it
you
had
better
conform
to
its
customs
observed
lord
george
without
looking
towards
me
felt
my
blood
boil
so
that
it
was
an
effort
not
to
strike
him
two
ladies
near
me
who
had
heard
the
passage
between
us
cried
no
gentleman
would
have
said
that
this
gave
me
courage
to
maintain
my
we
were
now
in
the
theatre
the
orchestra
was
playing
a
brilliant
prelude
to
a
waltz
and
lord
george
as
if
he
had
forgotten
all
about
me
prepared
to
start
i
laid
my
hand
peremptorily
on
his
arm
my
set
i
said
and
my
voice
shook
with
agitation
tolerate
gratuitous
impertinence
you
either
make
me
an
apology
or
i
shall
exact
reparation
of
another
indeed
i
shall
be
happy
to
hear
from
you
at
your
convenience
sneered
lord
george
with
a
low
bow
he
turned
away
and
said
in
a
voice
loud
enough
to
be
heard
by
me
or
any
one
else
near
puppy
imagines
i
suppose
that
i
would
meet
him
in
a
duel
the
next
thing
will
be
we
shall
have
our
footmen
sending
us
challenges
capital
joke
by
jove
come
we
are
losing
time
lady
caroline
the
waltz
is
half
were
starting
this
time
when
a
voice
behind
me
called
out
imperiously
moment
lord
george
halberdyne
the
gentleman
whom
you
have
insulted
is
a
friend
of
mine
and
a
guest
of
the
duchess
of
b
two
conditions
that
qualify
him
i
think
to
be
an
adversary
of
a
friend
of
yours
is
he
repeated
lord
george
facing
around
a
natural
phenomenon
that
i
shall
not
stop
to
investigate
just
now
but
it
certainly
puts
this
gentleman
in
a
new
light
sir
i
shall
have
the
pleasure
probably
of
seeing
you
shall
my
lord
i
replied
and
allowing
hallam
to
link
my
arm
in
his
and
draw
me
away
i
turned
my
back
on
the
brilliant
scene
and
hurried
out
of
the
house
feverish
humiliated
desperate
idiot
the
snob
you
shall
give
him
a
lesson
that
not
forget
in
a
hurry
said
hallam
who
seemed
nearly
as
indignant
and
excited
as
myself
you
a
good
shot
have
you
ever
stood
fire
answered
both
questions
in
the
negative
he
was
evidently
put
out
but
presently
he
said
in
a
confident
tone
it
does
not
so
much
matter
you
are
the
offended
party
and
consequently
you
have
the
choice
of
weapons
it
shall
be
swords
instead
of
pistols
i
suppose
a
pretty
good
swordsman
dear
hallam
i
said
forget
that
these
things
are
not
in
my
line
at
all
i
never
handled
a
sword
since
we
flourished
them
in
the
fencing
hall
at
oxford
in
fact
if
the
choice
be
mine
as
you
say
it
is
i
think
i
would
do
better
to
choose
pistols
i
have
a
chance
with
them
and
if
lord
george
be
a
swordsman
i
have
none
with
the
seemed
seriously
disconcerted
not
quite
such
an
affair
of
chance
as
you
appear
to
imagine
he
said
is
one
of
the
best
shots
in
the
service
he
never
misses
his
mark
and
he
is
a
swordsman
my
honor
i
know
what
to
advise
must
stand
advised
by
myself
then
and
here
goes
for
pistols
i
said
trying
to
put
a
bold
face
on
it
though
i
confess
i
felt
anything
but
cheerful
at
the
prospect
will
stand
by
me
hallam
will
you
not
course
i
will
committed
myself
to
as
much
already
he
answered
cordially
but
i
saw
he
was
uncomfortable
shall
take
your
card
to
the
scoundrel
morning
i
wonder
who
have
for
second
that
bully
roper
very
likely
he
went
on
talking
more
to
himself
than
to
me
the
meeting
to
take
place
morning
i
inquired
and
a
sudden
rush
of
anguish
came
on
me
as
i
put
the
question
i
thought
of
my
mother
of
all
that
might
be
in
store
for
her
so
soon
must
try
and
put
it
off
for
a
day
said
hallam
is
deucedly
awkward
you
see
if
it
comes
off
because
of
the
play
you
may
get
hit
and
it
would
be
a
terrible
business
if
you
were
de
for
the
there
was
something
so
grimly
comical
in
the
earnestness
with
which
he
said
this
that
though
i
was
in
no
merry
mood
i
burst
out
laughing
terrible
business
indeed
i
said
exceedingly
unpleasant
for
lady
caroline
particularly
to
be
left
in
the
lurch
on
such
an
occasion
however
if
i
go
to
the
wall
and
lord
george
comes
off
safe
he
might
get
up
the
part
in
a
hurry
and
replace
me
eh
i
had
hit
the
mark
without
knowing
it
it
was
jealousy
that
had
provoked
lord
george
to
the
gratuitous
attack
i
suppose
there
was
something
sardonic
in
my
voice
that
struck
hallam
with
the
inappropriateness
of
his
previous
remarks
he
suddenly
stopped
and
grasping
my
arm
warmly
used
to
this
sort
of
thing
my
dear
fellow
he
said
fancy
from
that
that
my
feelings
are
turned
to
stone
or
that
i
forget
all
that
is
that
may
be
unpleasant
in
the
matter
but
there
is
no
use
talking
of
these
things
they
unman
a
fellow
and
he
wants
all
his
nerves
in
working
order
at
a
moment
like
this
take
my
advice
and
go
home
now
and
cool
yourself
by
a
quiet
night
for
work
if
it
is
to
be
you
may
have
some
letters
to
write
or
other
things
to
attend
to
and
they
had
better
be
done
at
replied
that
i
had
no
letters
to
write
and
no
business
instructions
to
leave
the
idea
of
facing
my
home
passing
my
door
and
then
going
to
bed
as
if
the
world
had
not
turned
right
round
as
if
all
life
the
present
and
the
future
were
not
revolutionized
this
was
what
i
did
not
at
this
moment
at
least
feel
equal
to
and
i
said
so
would
rather
go
for
an
hour
to
the
club
i
said
you
mind
and
we
will
have
a
game
of
billiards
i
feel
inclined
to
go
home
and
i
should
not
sleep
if
i
went
to
as
you
like
he
said
the
night
is
so
fine
we
may
as
well
take
a
few
more
turns
in
the
open
air
it
does
one
good
after
those
heated
did
me
no
good
i
felt
the
most
miserable
man
in
this
miserable
world
i
would
have
given
any
happiness
the
world
could
have
offered
me
to
undo
this
work
to
be
as
i
was
an
hour
ago
free
guiltless
of
projected
murder
or
suicide
i
repeated
to
myself
that
it
was
not
my
fault
that
i
had
been
gratuitously
provoked
beyond
endurance
that
as
a
gentleman
i
could
not
have
done
otherwise
but
these
sophistries
neither
calmed
nor
strengthened
me
truer
voices
rose
up
and
answered
them
in
clear
and
imperious
tones
that
drowned
the
foolish
comforters
why
had
i
ever
entered
the
society
where
my
position
exposed
me
to
such
results
what
business
had
i
there
what
good
could
it
do
myself
or
any
one
else
to
have
been
tolerated
even
courted
as
i
fancied
i
was
by
these
fine
people
who
had
nothing
of
any
sort
in
common
with
me
i
had
forsaken
my
legitimate
place
the
profession
that
my
mother
had
made
such
heavy
sacrifices
to
open
to
me
i
had
deliberately
frittered
away
my
life
destroyed
my
prospects
of
honorable
success
and
this
is
what
it
had
brought
me
to
i
was
going
either
to
shoot
a
man
who
had
done
me
no
graver
injury
than
offend
my
pride
and
punish
my
folly
or
to
be
shot
down
by
him
and
then
i
saw
myself
brought
home
to
my
mother
dangerously
wounded
dead
perhaps
i
heard
her
cry
of
agony
i
saw
her
mortal
despair
i
could
have
cried
out
loud
for
pity
of
her
i
could
have
cursed
myself
for
my
folly
for
the
mad
sinful
folly
that
had
rewarded
her
by
such
an
awakening
is
an
electric
current
that
runs
from
mind
to
mind
communicating
almost
like
an
articulate
voice
the
thoughts
that
are
passing
within
us
at
certain
moments
i
had
not
spoken
for
several
minutes
as
we
paced
up
and
down
pall
mall
puffing
our
cigars
in
the
starlight
but
this
current
i
speak
of
had
passed
from
my
brain
to
and
informed
him
of
what
my
thoughts
were
busy
on
let
yourself
down
old
boy
he
said
harm
may
come
of
it
after
all
known
a
score
of
duels
where
both
sides
came
off
with
no
more
than
a
sometimes
with
no
scratch
at
all
not
that
i
suspect
you
of
being
i
remember
what
a
you
were
at
oxford
but
the
bravest
of
us
may
be
a
coward
for
felt
something
rise
in
my
throat
as
if
it
would
choke
me
i
could
not
get
a
word
out
knows
continued
hallam
in
his
cheeriest
tone
may
be
bringing
down
the
house
night
and
your
mother
may
be
the
proudest
woman
in
london
seeing
you
the
king
of
the
company
cheered
and
complimented
by
women
and
brave
men
i
feel
as
sure
of
it
do
you
know
as
if
i
saw
it
in
a
spoke
in
kindness
but
the
levity
of
his
tone
the
utter
hollowness
of
his
consolations
were
intolerable
they
mocked
my
misery
every
word
pierced
me
like
a
knife
what
evil
genius
had
led
me
across
this
path
only
a
few
weeks
ago
i
said
it
was
the
work
of
an
angel
a
good
fairy
or
some
absurdity
of
the
sort
it
was
more
likely
a
demon
that
had
done
it
if
i
had
never
met
him
i
said
to
myself
i
would
never
have
known
this
hour
i
should
have
been
an
innocent
and
a
happy
man
but
this
would
not
do
either
i
was
neither
innocent
nor
happy
when
i
met
him
i
was
false
to
my
duty
wasting
my
life
and
sick
to
death
of
both
only
longing
for
the
opportunity
which
hallam
had
brought
me
if
i
had
not
met
him
i
should
have
met
or
sought
out
some
other
tempter
and
bitten
greedily
at
the
bait
when
it
was
offered
still
i
felt
embittered
toward
hallam
i
accused
him
as
if
he
had
been
the
sole
author
of
my
misfortune
as
if
i
had
been
a
baby
or
an
idiot
without
or
responsibility
into
the
club
i
said
dropping
his
arm
and
throwing
away
the
end
of
my
cigar
did
not
notice
the
impatient
movement
but
readily
crossed
over
and
we
entered
the
club
the
lofty
spacious
rooms
were
blazing
with
light
and
filled
with
groups
of
men
some
were
lounging
on
luxurious
couches
reading
the
evening
papers
some
were
chatting
some
were
playing
cards
an
air
of
easy
grandeur
prosperity
and
surface
happiness
pervaded
the
place
i
felt
horribly
out
of
keeping
with
it
all
i
had
no
business
amongst
these
wealthy
fashionable
men
i
was
like
a
skeleton
stalking
into
the
feast
i
believe
it
was
nothing
but
sheer
human
respect
the
fear
of
making
myself
ridiculous
that
prevented
me
from
turning
on
my
heel
and
rushing
straight
out
of
the
house
i
mechanically
took
up
the
which
a
member
tossed
on
to
a
table
near
me
and
sat
down
as
if
i
were
going
to
read
it
that
alone
and
come
into
the
said
hallam
and
he
whipped
the
paper
out
of
my
hands
with
brotherly
unceremoniousness
rose
and
followed
him
like
a
dog
i
would
have
gone
anywhere
done
anything
he
or
anybody
else
suggested
physically
i
was
indifferent
to
what
i
did
my
brain
on
fire
i
felt
as
if
i
were
walking
in
a
dream
were
passing
into
the
when
a
gentleman
who
was
seated
at
a
cried
out
to
hallam
to
come
and
join
them
it
was
leveson
a
brother
officer
and
great
friend
of
his
hallam
replied
that
he
was
going
on
to
have
a
pull
at
the
balls
but
he
strolled
over
to
see
how
the
game
was
going
i
mechanically
followed
him
some
of
the
players
knew
me
and
greeted
me
with
a
friendly
nod
they
were
absorbed
in
the
game
it
was
lansquenet
i
knew
very
little
about
cards
but
lansquenet
was
the
one
game
that
interested
me
i
had
lost
a
few
sovereigns
a
night
or
two
before
at
it
and
as
the
luck
seemed
set
in
against
the
banker
it
flashed
over
me
i
could
not
do
better
than
to
take
a
hand
and
win
them
back
now
i
did
not
however
volunteer
to
join
the
game
in
my
present
state
of
smarting
pride
i
would
not
run
the
risk
of
being
made
to
feel
i
was
an
intruder
unluckily
friend
reading
temptation
on
my
countenance
perhaps
said
holding
up
his
cards
to
me
in
splendid
vein
but
i
must
be
off
sell
you
my
hand
for
half
a
sovereign
if
you
i
said
and
paying
the
i
sat
down
i
had
scarcely
taken
his
place
when
there
was
a
noise
in
the
adjoining
room
announcing
fresh
arrivals
i
recognized
one
loud
domineering
voice
above
the
others
and
presently
lord
george
halberdyne
came
in
leveson
he
said
against
you
i
suppose
the
contrary
never
was
in
better
vein
in
my
life
replied
the
colonel
sold
my
hand
for
a
song
because
i
have
an
appointment
that
i
the
lucky
dog
you
sold
it
to
asked
lord
george
botfield
said
leveson
my
real
name
is
botfield
i
only
took
the
name
of
baines
when
i
fell
into
disgrace
and
misery
george
muttered
an
exclamation
of
some
sort
whether
of
surprise
or
vexation
i
could
not
tell
and
advanced
to
the
table
you
mind
my
joining
you
he
said
appealing
to
nobody
in
particular
there
was
a
general
assent
and
he
sat
down
hallam
would
not
take
a
hand
he
hated
cards
his
passion
was
for
billiards
and
he
played
nothing
else
he
came
and
stood
behind
me
to
watch
the
game
i
felt
him
lay
his
hand
on
my
shoulder
as
if
to
encourage
me
and
remind
me
that
he
was
there
to
stand
by
me
and
take
my
part
against
my
late
bully
if
needs
be
it
did
not
seem
as
if
he
was
likely
to
be
called
upon
to
do
so
my
late
bully
was
as
gracious
as
man
could
be
at
least
he
intended
to
be
so
but
i
took
his
familiar
facetiousness
for
covert
impertinence
and
it
made
my
blood
boil
quite
as
fiercely
as
his
recent
open
insult
had
done
i
was
not
man
of
the
world
enough
to
understand
that
lord
george
was
only
doing
his
duty
to
society
that
he
was
in
fact
behaving
beautifully
with
infinite
tact
like
an
accomplished
gentleman
i
could
not
understand
that
the
social
canons
of
his
made
it
incumbent
on
a
man
to
joke
and
laugh
and
demean
himself
in
this
lively
careless
fashion
towards
the
man
whom
he
was
going
to
shoot
in
a
few
hours
i
grew
inwardly
exasperated
and
it
was
nothing
but
pride
and
an
unprecedented
effort
of
will
that
enabled
me
to
keep
my
temper
and
remain
outwardly
cool
for
a
time
for
about
twenty
minutes
the
luck
continued
in
the
same
vein
my
had
been
paid
back
to
me
more
than
fifty
times
leveson
was
right
when
he
said
he
had
sold
his
hand
for
a
song
hallam
was
all
this
time
standing
behind
my
chair
smoking
his
cigar
and
throwing
in
a
word
between
the
puffs
the
clock
struck
two
off
now
botfield
he
said
tapping
me
on
the
shoulder
off
while
your
star
is
shining
it
is
sure
to
go
down
if
you
stay
too
likely
most
sage
and
prudent
mentor
retorted
lord
george
that
cuts
both
ways
your
friend
has
been
pocketing
our
money
up
to
this
only
fair
he
should
give
us
a
chance
of
winning
it
back
and
pocketing
a
little
of
his
that
is
a
law
recognized
i
as
he
said
this
he
turned
to
me
enough
but
i
saw
where
the
emphasis
pointed
and
stung
to
the
quick
i
replied
that
i
had
not
the
least
intention
of
going
counter
to
the
law
i
would
remain
as
long
as
the
game
lasted
committing
yourself
somewhat
rashly
interposed
hallam
know
what
nefarious
gamblers
these
fellows
are
capable
of
keeping
it
up
till
morning
they
do
i
shall
keep
it
up
with
them
i
replied
recklessly
i
was
desperate
and
my
luck
was
good
said
no
more
but
sauntered
to
the
other
side
of
the
table
where
i
his
eyes
fixed
on
me
warningly
entreatingly
looked
up
at
last
and
met
them
fastened
on
me
in
a
mute
impatient
appeal
i
answered
it
by
a
peremptory
nod
he
saw
i
would
not
brook
farther
interference
so
he
took
himself
off
to
the
and
did
not
reappear
for
an
hour
can
not
recall
clearly
what
passed
during
the
interval
the
luck
had
turned
suddenly
against
me
but
nothing
daunted
i
went
on
playing
desperately
losing
as
fast
as
i
had
been
winning
only
in
much
heavier
sums
for
the
stakes
had
risen
enormously
on
the
change
of
luck
there
was
a
large
pool
immense
it
seemed
to
me
some
two
hundred
pounds
i
lost
again
and
again
at
last
terror
sobered
me
i
began
to
realize
the
madness
of
my
conduct
and
wanted
to
withdraw
but
they
cried
out
against
it
reminded
me
that
i
had
pledged
myself
to
remain
and
see
the
game
out
lord
george
was
loudest
in
protesting
that
i
must
remain
have
luck
always
he
said
man
must
put
up
with
it
when
the
tide
turns
it
is
of
good
omen
for
you
botfield
he
added
pointedly
will
be
in
splendid
luck
shuddered
i
can
remember
the
horrible
sick
sensation
that
ran
through
me
as
he
said
this
lightly
pleasantly
as
if
he
alluded
to
a
i
had
in
view
i
saw
my
pale
face
beckoning
me
to
come
away
to
stop
before
i
ruined
her
utterly
i
almost
made
a
movement
to
rise
but
something
glued
me
to
the
chair
the
game
went
on
i
again
held
the
bank
and
again
lost
i
had
no
money
about
me
except
the
forty
pounds
or
so
i
had
won
at
the
outset
but
several
leaves
out
of
my
pocketbook
were
strewn
about
the
table
bearing
for
nine
times
that
sum
i
suppose
by
this
time
i
had
quite
lost
my
senses
i
know
that
i
went
on
betting
like
a
maniac
with
the
feverish
triumphant
impulse
of
a
man
in
delirium
i
was
losing
tremendously
i
remember
nothing
except
the
sound
of
my
own
voice
and
lord
calling
again
and
again
and
how
the
cry
ran
through
me
like
a
blade
every
time
and
how
i
hastily
tore
out
fresh
leaves
and
wrote
down
the
sums
i
lost
and
tossed
them
to
the
winner
and
went
on
all
this
time
we
had
been
drinking
deeply
of
brandy
and
water
i
was
naturally
abstemious
but
i
drank
recklessly
the
wonder
was
and
i
was
going
to
say
the
pity
that
it
had
not
stupefied
me
long
ago
and
so
made
me
physically
incapable
of
continuing
my
insane
career
but
excitement
acted
i
suppose
as
an
antidote
and
prevented
the
alcohol
from
taking
effect
as
it
otherwise
must
have
done
at
last
hallam
came
back
i
have
a
vague
recollection
of
hearing
him
exchange
some
remarks
in
an
undertone
with
one
of
the
players
who
had
given
up
and
was
now
watching
the
game
with
a
number
of
others
who
had
dropped
in
from
adjoining
rooms
i
then
heard
him
say
god
he
is
ruined
twice
over
i
heard
nothing
more
i
had
fallen
back
insensible
in
my
chair
everybody
started
up
the
cards
were
dropped
and
all
was
confusion
and
terror
it
appears
that
at
the
first
moment
they
thought
i
was
dead
a
young
guardsman
present
declared
i
was
and
that
it
was
disease
of
the
heart
a
young
kinsman
of
his
had
dropped
down
on
parade
only
a
month
ago
just
in
the
same
way
there
was
a
cry
for
a
doctor
and
two
or
three
ran
out
to
fetch
one
before
he
arrived
however
i
had
given
signs
of
returning
consciousness
up
to
this
moment
lord
george
had
been
anxiously
looking
on
silent
and
pale
they
said
he
had
borne
me
with
hallam
to
a
couch
in
the
next
room
where
the
air
was
free
from
and
had
opened
the
window
to
admit
the
fresh
he
had
done
in
fact
what
any
humane
person
would
have
done
under
the
circumstances
but
he
had
done
it
in
a
manner
that
betokened
more
than
ordinary
interest
he
drew
an
audible
breath
of
relief
the
moment
he
saw
my
eyelids
quiver
and
heard
me
breathe
like
a
man
awaking
to
life
hallam
signed
to
him
to
leave
the
room
he
did
not
wish
his
face
to
be
the
first
i
saw
on
opening
my
eyes
lord
george
no
doubt
understood
for
he
at
once
withdrew
into
the
he
drew
the
door
after
him
but
he
did
not
quite
close
it
so
that
i
heard
dreamily
yet
distinctly
all
that
was
said
lord
second
for
the
meeting
the
hon
capt
roper
inquired
eagerly
how
i
was
going
on
be
all
right
presently
was
the
reply
spoken
in
lord
way
was
nothing
to
make
such
a
fuss
about
the
poor
devil
was
scared
to
see
how
much
money
he
had
lost
and
fainted
like
a
girl
says
he
is
quite
cleared
out
by
observed
some
one
him
right
said
lord
george
will
teach
puppies
of
his
kind
not
to
come
amongst
us
and
make
fools
of
do
you
mean
to
shoot
him
inquired
the
same
voice
mean
to
give
him
a
chance
of
shooting
me
unless
he
continued
and
i
saw
in
imagination
as
vividly
as
if
my
bodily
eyes
had
seen
it
the
cold
sneer
that
accompanied
the
remark
he
shows
the
white
feather
and
declines
fighting
which
is
just
as
this
little
dialogue
had
been
going
on
in
subdued
tones
close
by
the
door
which
opened
at
the
head
of
the
sofa
where
i
lay
hallam
was
conversing
in
animated
whispers
with
two
gentlemen
in
the
window
he
was
not
more
than
a
minute
absent
when
he
returned
to
my
side
and
seeing
my
eyes
wide
open
exclaimed
heartily
god
all
right
again
grasped
his
hand
and
sat
up
they
gave
me
some
and
water
to
drink
and
i
was
as
he
said
all
right
again
but
it
was
not
the
stimulant
that
restored
me
that
gave
me
such
sudden
energy
and
nerved
me
to
act
at
once
to
face
my
fate
and
defy
it
i
took
his
arm
and
led
him
or
let
him
lead
me
to
some
quieter
place
near
and
then
i
asked
him
how
much
he
thought
i
had
lost
think
of
that
yet
my
dear
fellow
he
said
are
too
done
up
to
discuss
it
we
will
see
what
can
be
done
thousand
pounds
i
said
you
hear
that
five
thousand
pounds
that
means
that
i
am
a
beggar
which
of
much
consequence
and
that
made
a
beggar
of
my
mother
she
will
have
to
sell
the
bed
from
under
her
to
pay
it
to
save
my
honor
a
curse
upon
me
for
bringing
this
blight
upon
her
tut
man
take
on
like
a
woman
about
it
said
hallam
things
can
be
arranged
no
need
to
make
matters
out
worse
than
they
are
speak
to
lord
george
and
see
what
terms
we
can
make
with
made
me
light
a
cigar
and
left
me
alone
while
he
went
back
to
parley
with
the
man
who
held
my
fortune
my
life
my
all
in
his
hands
i
never
heard
exactly
all
that
passed
between
them
i
only
know
that
in
answer
to
lord
question
put
in
a
tone
of
insulting
haughtiness
the
fellow
pledged
himself
for
more
than
worth
he
pay
hallam
replied
can
but
it
will
ruin
upon
which
the
other
retorted
with
a
laugh
the
devil
is
that
to
me
and
turned
his
back
on
my
second
who
had
nothing
left
but
to
take
capt
roper
aside
and
arrange
for
the
meeting
he
came
back
and
told
me
all
was
settled
that
halberdyne
was
behaving
like
a
brute
and
would
be
tabooed
in
the
clubs
and
every
decent
before
hours
this
thought
seemed
to
afford
him
great
satisfaction
it
gave
me
none
anguish
had
drowned
resentment
i
could
think
of
nothing
except
that
i
was
a
ruined
man
that
i
had
beggared
my
mother
and
that
i
was
going
to
fight
a
duel
in
a
few
hours
richmond
park
pistols
at
thirty
paces
this
was
how
the
appointment
was
notified
by
our
seconds
to
both
of
us
suddenly
a
light
burst
on
me
a
ray
of
hope
of
consolation
i
might
be
killed
in
this
duel
and
if
so
surely
my
honor
would
be
saved
and
my
debt
cancelled
lord
george
would
not
pursue
my
mother
for
the
money
she
should
know
nothing
of
this
work
until
after
the
meeting
if
i
escaped
with
a
wound
i
would
tell
her
if
i
died
who
would
have
the
cruelty
to
do
so
i
told
hallam
of
this
sudden
thought
as
he
walked
home
with
me
he
approved
of
it
and
cheered
me
up
by
almost
assuring
me
that
i
should
be
shot
halberdyne
was
a
it
was
most
likely
that
i
should
not
leave
the
field
alive
night
passed
the
few
hours
of
it
that
must
elapse
before
the
time
named
for
the
meeting
god
how
did
i
live
through
them
and
yet
this
was
nothing
absolutely
nothing
compared
to
what
was
yet
in
store
for
duel
took
place
lord
george
wounded
me
in
the
hip
he
escaped
unhurt
i
fired
in
the
air
i
was
carried
home
on
a
door
insensible
hallam
had
gone
before
to
prepare
my
mother
for
some
weeks
it
was
feared
i
would
not
live
then
amputation
was
talked
of
i
escaped
finally
with
being
a
cripple
for
life
before
i
was
out
of
danger
leave
expired
and
he
went
to
rejoin
his
regiment
he
had
been
very
assiduous
in
calling
to
inquire
for
me
had
seen
my
mother
and
judging
by
her
passionate
grief
that
i
was
in
a
fair
way
not
to
recover
he
had
forborne
mentioning
anything
about
the
five
thousand
pounds
she
promised
to
write
and
let
him
know
when
any
change
took
place
meantime
she
had
found
out
my
secret
i
had
talked
incessantly
of
it
in
my
delirium
and
with
an
accuracy
of
iteration
that
left
no
doubt
on
her
mind
but
that
there
was
a
foundation
of
truth
in
the
feverish
ravings
the
doctor
was
of
the
same
mind
and
urged
her
to
give
me
an
opportunity
of
relieving
my
mind
of
the
burden
whatever
it
was
as
soon
as
this
was
possible
first
day
that
i
was
strong
enough
to
bear
conversation
she
accordingly
broached
the
subject
i
inferred
at
once
that
hallam
had
told
her
everything
and
repeated
the
miserable
story
only
to
confirm
what
i
supposed
he
had
already
said
mother
was
sitting
by
my
bedside
she
busied
herself
with
teaseling
out
linen
into
lint
for
my
wound
and
so
purposely
no
doubt
kept
her
face
continually
bent
or
averted
from
mine
how
quietly
she
took
it
i
began
to
think
i
had
overrated
the
misfortune
that
we
had
larger
resources
in
some
way
than
i
had
imagined
it
is
possible
for
us
to
pay
this
horrible
debt
and
save
my
honor
and
yet
not
be
utterly
beggared
mother
i
said
eagerly
she
looked
at
me
with
a
smile
that
must
surely
have
been
the
reflex
of
some
angel
near
her
whom
i
could
not
see
my
boy
he
shall
be
paid
and
we
shall
not
be
beggars
she
said
gently
and
pressed
my
hand
in
both
her
own
should
have
told
me
about
it
at
once
it
has
been
preying
on
your
mind
and
retarding
your
cure
all
this
time
i
will
see
kerwin
and
have
it
arranged
at
once
promise
me
now
like
a
good
boy
to
forget
it
and
think
no
more
of
it
until
you
are
quite
well
will
you
promise
did
not
answer
but
signed
with
my
lips
for
her
to
kiss
me
she
rose
and
twined
her
arms
around
me
and
let
me
sob
out
my
sorrow
and
my
love
upon
her
breast
was
about
three
days
after
this
that
she
handed
me
a
letter
to
read
it
was
from
lord
george
to
kerwin
and
ran
thus
i
beg
to
acknowledge
the
receipt
of
the
sum
of
five
thousand
pounds
which
you
have
forwarded
to
my
lawyers
in
the
name
of
botfield
i
make
this
acknowledgment
personally
in
order
to
express
my
sincere
satisfaction
at
the
happy
progress
of
recovery
and
beg
you
will
convey
this
sentiment
to
i
remain
mother
i
cried
out
and
opened
my
arms
to
her
in
a
passion
of
tears
but
she
laid
her
finger
smilingly
on
my
lips
and
made
me
be
silent
in
a
month
hence
when
i
was
well
we
should
talk
it
all
over
but
not
now
the
month
was
out
was
marmaduke
started
to
his
feet
with
a
cry
of
horror
and
botfield
unable
to
control
the
anguish
that
his
own
narrative
evoked
dropped
his
head
into
his
hands
and
shook
the
room
with
his
sobs
dear
god
that
i
should
have
lived
to
tell
it
to
talk
over
the
mother
that
i
murdered
brave
tender
generous
mother
i
killed
you
i
broke
your
heart
and
then
then
i
brought
shame
upon
your
memory
o
god
o
god
why
have
i
outlived
it
he
rocked
to
and
fro
almost
shouting
in
his
paroxysm
of
despair
marmaduke
had
never
beheld
such
grief
he
had
never
in
his
life
been
so
deeply
moved
with
pity
he
did
not
know
what
to
say
what
to
do
his
heart
prompted
him
to
do
the
right
thing
he
fell
on
his
knees
and
putting
his
arms
around
the
wretched
man
he
burst
into
tears
and
sobbed
with
him
botfield
suffered
his
embrace
for
a
moment
and
then
pressing
his
horny
palm
on
the
young
blond
head
he
muttered
bless
you
god
bless
you
for
your
pity
as
soon
as
they
were
both
calmed
marmaduke
asked
him
if
he
would
not
prefer
finishing
the
story
but
he
signed
to
him
to
sit
down
that
he
would
go
on
with
it
to
the
end
is
there
more
to
tell
he
said
sadly
shaking
his
head
was
lying
a
cripple
on
my
bed
when
she
was
carried
to
her
grave
i
was
seized
with
a
violent
brain
fever
which
turned
to
typhus
and
they
took
me
to
the
hospital
the
servants
were
dismissed
they
had
received
notice
from
my
mother
she
had
foreseen
everything
taken
every
necessary
step
as
calmly
as
if
the
catastrophe
i
had
brought
upon
her
had
been
a
mere
change
of
residence
for
her
own
convenience
all
we
had
was
gone
that
brave
answer
of
hers
to
my
question
about
our
resources
was
a
subterfuge
of
her
love
if
ever
a
sin
was
sinless
assuredly
that
falsehood
was
she
had
directed
the
lawyer
to
raise
the
money
immediately
at
every
sacrifice
she
meant
to
work
for
her
bread
and
trusted
to
me
to
make
the
task
light
and
short
to
her
i
would
have
done
it
had
she
been
spared
to
me
so
help
me
god
i
would
but
now
that
she
was
gone
i
had
nothing
to
work
for
i
left
the
hospital
a
cripple
and
a
beggar
i
did
not
even
yet
know
to
what
an
extent
i
went
straight
to
our
old
house
expecting
to
find
it
as
i
had
left
it
that
is
before
all
consciousness
had
left
me
i
found
it
dismantled
empty
painters
busy
on
scaffolding
outside
i
went
to
kerwin
and
there
learned
the
whole
truth
nothing
remained
to
me
but
suicide
nothing
kept
me
from
it
i
believe
but
the
prayers
of
my
were
a
christian
then
interrupted
marmaduke
in
a
tone
of
unfeigned
surprise
ought
to
have
been
my
father
was
and
my
mother
was
i
was
brought
up
as
one
until
i
went
to
the
university
and
lost
what
little
belief
i
had
for
a
moment
it
seemed
to
come
back
to
me
when
i
found
myself
alone
in
the
world
i
remember
walking
deliberately
down
to
the
side
when
i
left
the
office
fully
determined
to
drown
myself
but
before
i
reached
the
water
i
heard
my
voice
calling
so
distinctly
to
me
to
stop
that
i
felt
myself
arrested
as
by
some
visible
presence
i
heard
the
voice
saying
you
wish
never
to
see
me
again
even
in
the
next
world
of
course
it
was
the
work
of
imagination
of
my
feelings
but
the
effect
was
the
same
i
stopped
and
retraced
my
steps
to
was
your
guardian
angel
perhaps
your
that
saved
you
said
marmaduke
i
forgot
said
botfield
brother
is
a
catholic
i
suppose
you
are
too
marmaduke
nodded
assent
he
felt
that
his
catholicity
was
not
much
to
boast
of
like
the
poor
outcast
before
him
he
had
lost
his
faith
practically
though
he
adhered
to
it
in
name
it
was
an
angel
of
some
sort
that
rescued
me
said
botfield
was
no
doubt
my
own
fault
if
the
rescue
was
not
complete
i
went
back
to
kerwin
and
asked
him
to
give
me
or
get
me
something
to
do
my
chance
on
the
stage
was
at
an
end
even
if
i
could
have
turned
to
that
i
was
dead
lame
he
got
me
a
situation
as
clerk
in
an
office
but
the
weariness
of
the
life
and
the
pressure
of
remorse
were
more
than
i
could
bear
i
took
to
drink
they
forgave
me
once
twice
the
third
time
i
was
dismissed
but
of
what
use
is
it
to
go
over
that
disgusting
pitiable
story
step
by
step
i
went
down
lower
and
lower
sinking
each
time
into
fouler
depths
drinking
more
loathsome
draughts
wallowing
in
mire
whose
very
existence
such
as
you
dream
of
i
will
spare
you
all
those
details
enough
that
i
came
at
last
to
what
you
see
me
one
day
when
hunger
was
gnawing
me
and
even
the
satanic
consolation
of
the
was
shut
against
me
for
want
of
a
sixpence
to
pay
for
a
glass
of
its
diabolical
elixir
i
fell
in
with
a
man
of
the
trade
he
offered
me
work
and
bread
hunger
is
not
a
dainty
counsellor
i
closed
with
the
offer
and
so
sank
into
the
last
slough
that
humanity
can
take
refuge
walpole
you
have
heard
my
history
it
was
a
pain
and
yet
somehow
a
relief
to
me
to
tell
it
it
has
not
been
a
very
pleasant
one
for
you
to
listen
to
still
i
regret
having
inflicted
it
on
you
you
are
very
young
you
are
prosperous
and
happy
and
most
likely
perfectly
free
from
any
of
the
temptations
that
have
been
the
bane
of
my
life
still
it
never
hurts
a
young
man
starting
in
life
to
hear
an
older
experience
if
ever
temptation
should
come
near
you
dash
it
from
you
with
all
your
might
scorn
and
defy
it
from
the
first
hold
no
parley
with
it
to
treat
with
perdition
is
to
be
have
done
me
a
greater
service
than
you
know
of
said
marmaduke
rising
and
preparing
to
take
leave
of
his
singular
entertainer
one
day
i
may
tell
he
took
a
turn
in
the
narrow
room
and
then
coming
back
to
botfield
resumed
in
an
agitated
manner
should
i
not
own
it
at
once
you
have
trusted
me
with
all
i
will
tell
you
the
botfield
looked
up
in
surprise
but
said
nothing
stand
on
the
very
brink
of
the
abyss
against
which
you
warn
me
like
you
i
am
a
barrister
like
you
i
hate
my
profession
and
spend
my
time
reading
poetry
and
playing
at
private
theatricals
they
are
my
passion
a
few
nights
ago
i
tried
my
luck
at
cards
and
won
this
tempted
me
i
played
last
night
and
lost
precisely
the
sum
of
twenty
botfield
started
and
uttered
a
suppressed
exclamation
am
in
debt
not
much
a
mere
trifle
if
it
lead
to
no
worse
you
see
now
what
a
service
you
may
have
done
me
who
knows
perhaps
my
guardian
angel
prompted
you
to
tell
me
your
story
as
a
warning
to
save
me
before
it
was
too
late
i
know
that
i
came
here
at
the
bidding
of
an
angel
and
reluctant
enough
i
was
to
take
the
message
never
thought
to
be
of
use
to
any
one
while
i
lived
said
botfield
with
emotion
bless
god
anyhow
if
my
wretched
example
proves
a
warning
to
you
who
sent
you
to
me
i
understood
it
was
your
brother
it
was
but
it
was
to
please
my
sister
that
i
consented
to
come
she
is
one
of
those
angels
that
people
talk
about
but
often
see
you
will
let
her
come
and
see
you
botfield
will
you
not
he
held
out
his
delicate
lavender
kid
hand
and
pressed
grimy
fingers
cordially
when
marmaduke
got
home
he
inquired
at
once
where
his
sister
was
and
hearing
she
was
in
her
room
he
crept
up
quietly
to
the
door
and
knocked
he
entered
so
quietly
that
nelly
had
scarcely
time
to
jump
off
her
knees
marmaduke
saw
at
once
that
he
had
taken
her
by
surprise
he
saw
also
that
her
eyes
were
red
is
the
matter
she
asked
with
a
frightened
look
anything
happened
you
have
been
away
so
long
what
kept
you
marmaduke
where
have
you
been
you
sent
poor
man
why
you
have
been
out
nearly
two
hours
it
did
not
take
all
that
time
to
give
your
message
said
incredulous
nelly
and
her
heart
beat
with
recent
apprehension
but
poor
man
had
a
message
for
me
sit
down
here
and
i
will
tell
you
what
it
was
but
how
cold
you
are
darling
you
are
positively
perished
where
have
you
been
said
nelly
since
i
went
out
since
you
went
were
you
doing
he
persisted
fixing
a
strange
look
on
her
she
blushed
hesitated
and
then
said
simply
was
praying
for
you
he
folded
her
in
his
arms
and
whispered
was
right
to
say
it
was
an
angel
sent
then
taking
a
warm
shawl
that
he
saw
hanging
up
he
wrapped
her
in
it
and
sat
down
beside
her
and
told
the
story
as
it
had
been
told
to
him
when
it
was
over
head
was
on
his
breast
and
the
tears
of
penitence
were
mingling
with
the
tears
of
joy
us
go
down
now
and
tell
stephen
said
marmaduke
when
he
had
finished
you
tell
him
everything
asked
nelly
marmy
i
am
so
happy
i
could
sing
for
joy
she
said
smiling
through
her
tears
us
kneel
down
here
and
say
one
little
prayer
together
will
you
and
he
did
did
you
thaw
the
man
and
break
up
the
ice
he
seemed
to
be
buried
under
was
amazed
inquiry
when
other
more
precious
and
interesting
questions
were
exhausted
merely
did
what
nelly
told
me
said
marmaduke
listened
to
on
christmas
morning
marmaduke
announced
his
intention
of
dining
out
it
was
a
sacrifice
to
all
three
but
no
one
opposed
him
nelly
made
up
a
store
of
provisions
including
a
hot
which
was
put
with
other
steaming
hot
dishes
into
the
ample
basket
that
the
gay
young
man
carried
off
in
a
cab
with
him
to
red
pepper
lane
there
he
found
a
clean
hearth
a
blazing
fire
and
a
table
spread
with
a
snowy
cloth
and
all
necessaries
complete
some
fairy
had
surely
been
at
work
in
that
gloomy
place
the
host
was
clean
and
brushed
looking
like
an
eccentric
gentleman
in
his
new
clothes
amidst
those
incongruous
surroundings
he
and
marmaduke
unpacked
the
basket
with
many
an
exclamation
at
its
inexhaustible
depths
that
was
the
happiest
if
not
the
very
merriest
christmas
dinner
that
ever
marmaduke
partook
of
when
it
was
over
and
they
were
puffing
a
quiet
cigar
over
the
fire
steps
were
heard
on
the
rickety
stairs
and
then
a
knock
at
the
door
and
a
silvery
voice
saying
we
come
in
it
was
stephen
and
nelly
see
why
you
should
have
all
the
pleasure
to
yourself
said
nelly
with
her
bright
laugh
would
never
have
been
here
at
all
if
i
had
not
teased
you
into
taking
the
message
if
this
were
a
romance
instead
of
a
true
episode
the
story
should
end
by
the
man
becoming
a
catholic
rising
to
wealth
and
distinction
and
marrying
nelly
but
the
events
of
real
life
adjust
themselves
so
conveniently
to
the
requirements
of
the
stephen
walpole
got
botfield
a
situation
in
the
where
by
good
conduct
and
intelligent
diligence
he
rose
gradually
to
a
position
of
trust
which
was
highly
paid
he
never
married
who
knows
perhaps
he
had
his
little
romance
and
never
dared
to
tell
it
the
protestant
episcopal
church
congress
the
second
annual
congress
of
the
protestant
episcopal
church
in
the
united
states
was
held
at
philadelphia
during
the
early
part
of
november
church
congresses
are
new
things
in
this
country
and
the
episcopalians
are
not
yet
quite
at
home
in
them
their
first
experiment
made
at
new
york
in
was
not
wholly
successful
some
of
their
leading
bishops
and
presbyters
treated
it
rather
cavalierly
apparently
in
the
fear
that
it
was
going
to
weaken
the
bonds
of
ecclesiastical
discipline
and
open
vexatious
questions
which
the
church
for
years
had
been
expending
all
its
learning
and
ingenuity
in
trying
to
answer
but
church
congresses
seemed
to
be
very
proper
and
respectable
things
for
every
denomination
which
laid
claim
to
antiquity
they
are
common
in
the
of
england
they
are
efficient
and
interesting
organizations
in
what
our
anglican
friends
are
pleased
to
call
the
roman
branch
of
the
church
of
christ
döllinger
has
them
regularly
in
the
and
so
the
originators
of
the
movement
in
the
american
have
persevered
in
their
attempt
to
establish
them
here
the
meeting
in
philadelphia
appears
to
have
been
all
that
its
promoters
could
have
reasonably
expected
the
denominational
papers
of
various
shades
of
opinion
concur
in
believing
that
the
permanency
of
the
congress
as
an
annual
institution
is
now
nearly
secured
and
we
find
one
of
these
journals
rejoicing
that
the
meeting
passed
off
with
cordiality
and
that
nothing
in
the
proceedings
prejudice
or
excited
hostile
this
indeed
was
something
to
boast
of
perhaps
it
would
have
been
still
more
gratifying
had
not
the
same
paper
explained
that
this
unexpected
peaceableness
of
the
congress
arose
the
fact
that
no
resolutions
were
adopted
no
legislation
proposed
no
elections
held
when
any
of
these
are
distinctly
in
view
those
who
participate
range
themselves
into
parties
and
it
is
almost
impossible
not
to
resort
to
measures
to
ensure
victory
which
generate
unkind
feelings
and
provoke
exaggerated
all
which
gives
us
a
queer
idea
of
the
manner
in
which
the
holy
ghost
is
supposed
to
operate
in
the
councils
of
the
protestant
episcopal
church
but
no
matter
let
us
be
glad
for
the
sake
of
propriety
that
this
was
merely
a
meeting
for
talk
and
not
for
action
the
strict
rules
applicable
to
conventions
synods
and
other
business
meetings
were
not
in
force
the
topics
of
discussion
were
not
so
much
points
of
doctrine
as
minor
questions
of
discipline
and
methods
of
applying
the
machinery
of
the
church
to
the
work
of
religion
and
with
the
knowledge
that
no
vote
was
to
be
taken
upon
any
subject
whatever
the
congress
unanimously
agreed
to
let
every
man
say
what
he
pleased
the
great
variety
of
irreconcilable
things
which
it
accordingly
pleased
the
gentlemen
to
say
seems
to
have
attracted
remark
and
denominational
papers
point
to
it
with
pride
as
a
proof
of
the
large
toleration
allowed
within
the
bosom
of
the
church
if
they
like
it
far
be
it
from
us
to
interfere
with
their
enjoyment
the
episcopal
church
is
one
of
the
largest
and
richest
of
the
protestant
sects
its
clergy
are
popularly
supposed
to
boast
of
more
general
culture
and
enjoy
fuller
opportunities
for
study
than
those
of
the
other
religious
bodies
and
its
people
are
found
in
large
numbers
among
the
educated
and
classes
a
congress
of
this
church
gathered
from
all
parts
of
the
country
representing
all
shades
of
opinion
and
possessing
almost
unbounded
facilities
for
talk
and
deliberation
ought
therefore
to
have
elicited
a
great
deal
that
was
worth
remembering
the
programme
of
the
sessions
was
stated
in
an
alluring
manner
by
bishop
clarke
of
rhode
island
who
made
the
introductory
address
come
said
he
consider
how
the
doctrine
and
organization
of
the
church
can
be
brought
most
effectually
to
and
then
he
went
on
to
speak
briefly
of
the
particular
things
in
our
daily
experience
which
the
church
ought
to
purify
and
bless
our
business
affairs
our
amusements
our
care
of
the
poor
our
family
relations
the
marriage
tie
practical
points
all
of
them
and
points
too
in
which
the
church
and
the
state
are
more
or
less
in
contact
well
having
laid
out
this
plan
of
work
how
did
the
congress
address
itself
to
it
the
first
session
gave
a
rather
curious
illustration
of
the
practical
spirit
of
the
assemblage
for
the
reverend
gentlemen
by
way
of
the
doctrine
and
organization
of
the
church
most
effectually
to
sanctity
rushed
straightway
with
hot
haste
into
the
subject
of
and
civil
authority
and
pounded
upon
the
doors
of
the
vatican
the
whole
afternoon
the
rev
francis
wharton
of
cambridge
was
careful
in
the
outset
to
distinguish
between
ultramontanism
and
the
roman
catholic
church
in
the
united
states
the
mass
of
us
he
believes
have
always
been
loyal
to
the
territory
of
whose
population
we
form
a
part
but
our
loyalty
has
no
connection
with
our
religion
if
we
followed
the
teachings
of
our
church
wharton
thinks
we
should
be
a
dangerous
set
of
people
teaches
that
the
pope
a
foreign
prince
deriving
his
support
from
a
foreign
civilization
is
entitled
to
set
aside
governments
which
he
considers
disloyal
and
to
annul
such
institutions
as
he
does
not
we
confess
that
we
do
not
know
what
wharton
means
by
the
pope
deriving
his
support
from
a
foreign
civilization
if
he
means
his
physical
support
then
the
doctor
is
both
wrong
and
right
for
that
is
derived
from
the
faithful
of
the
whole
world
if
he
means
that
his
authority
is
derived
from
a
foreign
civilization
then
the
doctor
is
apparently
irreverent
for
the
papal
authority
is
derived
from
the
institution
of
our
lord
jesus
christ
and
surely
a
respectable
cambridge
divine
would
not
call
that
a
foreign
civilization
as
for
the
distinction
which
is
drawn
between
american
and
ultramontane
catholics
let
us
repudiate
it
with
all
possible
warmth
before
we
go
any
further
ultramontanism
is
an
objectionable
word
because
it
was
invented
to
localize
a
school
of
religious
doctrine
which
is
the
only
school
the
school
acknowledged
all
over
the
world
but
if
it
be
understood
as
defining
that
spirit
of
faith
and
piety
which
yields
all
love
and
obedience
to
the
vicar
of
christ
accepts
all
the
vatican
decrees
gladly
and
without
reserve
is
not
afraid
of
paying
too
much
respect
to
the
holy
see
or
showing
too
much
humility
before
god
or
believing
one
little
particle
more
than
we
are
commanded
to
believe
under
pain
of
anathema
then
the
catholics
of
america
are
ultramontane
catholics
to
a
man
probably
there
are
no
catholics
in
any
country
of
the
world
less
disposed
to
compromise
in
matters
of
religious
duty
and
more
thoroughly
imbued
with
filial
reverence
and
love
for
the
head
of
church
on
earth
than
the
catholics
of
the
united
states
the
spirit
of
the
church
in
rome
is
the
spirit
of
the
church
in
america
and
when
wharton
asserts
that
political
tenets
of
ultramontanism
are
repudiated
by
the
leading
catholic
statesmen
of
our
land
he
makes
an
utterly
erroneous
statement
against
which
american
catholics
will
be
the
first
to
protest
it
is
very
true
that
with
the
fictitious
ultramontanism
conceived
of
his
fears
and
prejudices
neither
americans
nor
any
other
sensible
people
have
the
slightest
sympathy
but
show
us
what
rome
teaches
and
there
you
have
precisely
what
the
church
in
the
united
states
accepts
if
it
is
true
therefore
that
the
pope
claims
authority
set
aside
governments
which
he
considers
disloyal
and
to
annul
such
institutions
as
he
does
not
approve
it
must
be
true
that
america
upholds
his
pretensions
wharton
may
live
in
the
fear
that
his
holiness
will
some
day
send
the
noble
guard
to
set
aside
the
government
of
grant
whenever
it
becomes
while
he
may
well
feel
an
absolute
certainty
that
our
system
our
constitutional
prohibition
of
the
establishment
of
a
state
church
our
laws
against
sectarian
appropriations
and
various
other
wicked
and
heretical
provisions
found
on
our
will
sooner
or
later
be
by
a
decree
from
the
vatican
he
need
not
flatter
himself
that
any
superior
enlightenment
among
the
catholics
of
america
will
save
the
protestant
community
from
the
miserable
fate
in
store
for
it
we
are
not
a
bit
wiser
or
better
than
the
pope
the
possible
interference
of
the
vatican
with
our
congresses
and
wharton
evidently
regards
as
a
very
remote
danger
there
are
points
however
he
thinks
where
the
vatican
clashes
every
day
with
the
civil
power
and
where
it
ought
to
be
resisted
with
all
the
energy
at
our
command
and
just
at
this
part
of
the
reverend
address
we
should
like
very
much
to
have
seen
the
face
of
bishop
clarke
in
his
introductory
remarks
bishop
clarke
told
the
congress
that
one
of
the
most
important
subjects
for
churchmen
to
consider
was
the
influence
or
authority
of
the
church
over
the
family
relations
gospel
obtained
hold
of
the
family
before
it
touched
the
state
how
does
the
condition
of
the
marriage
bond
stand
in
some
of
our
states
it
is
as
easy
to
solve
it
as
it
is
to
join
it
is
this
the
religion
of
which
we
have
made
such
boast
but
here
before
the
echoes
of
the
words
have
fairly
died
away
is
the
rev
wharton
on
his
feet
denouncing
as
a
crime
the
very
interference
which
bishop
clarke
inculcated
as
a
duty
it
is
one
of
the
usurpations
of
ultramontanism
says
the
cambridge
doctor
to
annul
civil
marriages
which
the
state
holds
binding
and
to
treat
as
invalid
divorces
which
the
state
holds
good
this
is
one
of
the
most
serious
conflicts
between
the
state
and
the
vatican
and
it
is
one
if
we
understand
aright
the
somewhat
imperfect
report
of
his
remarks
in
which
protestant
episcopalians
must
prepare
themselves
to
take
an
earnest
part
remembering
that
while
their
church
is
free
it
is
free
church
within
a
free
sovereign
state
and
that
this
state
in
its
own
secular
sovereignty
is
here
then
we
have
a
distinct
declaration
that
the
family
relation
is
not
a
proper
subject
of
religious
regulation
if
the
state
sees
fit
to
make
it
as
easy
to
loose
the
marriage
bond
as
to
tie
it
the
church
has
no
right
to
object
it
is
a
secular
matter
and
the
free
sovereign
state
is
supreme
in
its
own
secular
sovereignty
if
the
state
sanctions
an
adulterous
connection
the
protestant
episcopal
church
must
revise
its
bible
and
bless
the
unholy
tie
it
is
a
secular
matter
and
the
free
sovereign
state
is
supreme
in
its
own
secular
sovereignty
the
sanctity
of
the
family
relation
is
under
the
protection
of
the
church
says
bishop
clarke
no
such
thing
replies
wharton
that
is
an
insolent
ultramontane
pretension
the
protestant
episcopal
church
knows
its
place
and
does
not
presume
to
interfere
with
the
legislature
gospel
obtained
hold
of
the
family
before
it
touched
the
state
says
the
bishop
well
we
have
changed
all
that
rejoins
the
doctor
the
glory
of
the
protestant
episcopal
gospel
nowadays
is
that
it
lets
the
family
alone
in
point
of
fact
episcopalianism
is
not
quite
so
bad
as
this
hasty
advocate
would
have
us
believe
for
it
does
censure
in
a
mild
way
the
laxity
of
some
of
the
divorce
laws
and
does
not
always
lend
itself
to
the
celebration
of
bigamous
marriages
but
wharton
is
correct
in
his
main
position
that
his
church
leaves
to
the
state
the
control
of
the
family
relation
and
if
she
shrinks
from
the
logical
consequences
of
her
desertion
of
duty
that
is
only
because
a
remnant
of
catholic
feeling
remains
to
her
in
the
midst
of
her
heresies
and
contradictions
the
time
must
come
however
when
these
illogical
fragments
of
truth
will
be
thrown
away
and
the
protestant
episcopal
church
will
take
its
place
beside
the
other
protestant
bodies
in
renouncing
all
right
to
be
heard
on
one
of
the
most
important
points
of
contact
between
the
law
of
god
and
the
concerns
of
life
it
is
impossible
to
allow
the
civil
power
to
bind
and
loose
the
family
tie
at
pleasure
without
admitting
that
the
subject
is
entirely
outside
the
domain
of
ecclesiastical
supervision
the
attempt
of
the
episcopal
church
to
compromise
on
adultery
is
an
absurdity
and
in
the
steady
course
of
protestant
development
it
will
surely
be
abolished
is
there
any
particular
in
which
the
protestant
episcopal
church
fairly
takes
hold
of
the
family
we
have
seen
that
she
abandons
to
politicians
the
sacred
tie
between
the
parents
what
has
she
to
do
with
the
next
domestic
concern
the
education
of
the
child
wharton
holds
it
to
be
one
of
her
distinguishing
claims
to
public
favor
that
she
abandons
this
duty
also
to
the
secular
power
the
right
to
control
education
according
to
him
is
like
the
right
to
sanction
the
marriage
tie
one
of
the
insolent
pretensions
of
the
vatican
usurper
the
state
he
thinks
is
bound
not
only
to
educate
all
its
subjects
but
to
decide
what
points
a
secular
education
shall
cover
while
the
church
may
only
add
to
this
irreligious
training
such
pious
instruction
as
the
child
may
have
time
and
strength
to
receive
after
the
more
serious
lessons
are
over
church
he
says
to
the
state
the
right
and
duty
to
require
a
secular
education
from
all
while
for
itself
it
undertakes
as
a
free
church
in
a
free
state
the
right
and
duty
to
give
a
religious
education
to
all
within
its
expressed
in
somewhat
plainer
english
this
means
that
thirty
hours
a
week
ought
to
be
given
to
the
dictionary
and
multiplication
table
and
one
hour
to
the
catechism
and
the
ten
commandments
send
your
children
to
schools
all
the
week
where
they
will
hear
nothing
whatever
of
religion
where
that
most
vital
of
all
concerns
will
be
a
forbidden
subject
where
the
idea
will
be
practically
if
not
in
so
many
words
impressed
upon
their
tender
minds
that
it
is
of
no
consequence
whether
they
are
christians
or
jews
or
infidels
so
long
as
they
master
the
various
branches
of
worldly
knowledge
which
promote
success
in
the
secular
affairs
of
life
and
then
get
them
into
if
you
can
for
a
wild
and
ineffectual
attempt
to
counteract
the
evil
tendencies
of
the
previous
six
teachings
this
is
trying
to
give
a
christian
education
without
the
of
christian
doctrine
building
a
house
upon
the
sand
and
then
running
around
it
once
a
week
with
a
hatful
of
pebbles
and
a
trowel
of
mud
to
put
a
foundation
under
the
finished
structure
wharton
seems
to
embody
in
his
own
person
a
surprising
variety
of
the
inconsistencies
for
which
the
protestant
episcopal
church
has
such
a
peculiar
celebrity
for
here
after
he
has
claimed
credit
for
his
church
as
the
champion
of
a
secular
education
he
tells
the
congress
that
secularism
is
one
of
the
great
dangers
of
the
age
against
which
the
church
must
fight
with
all
her
strength
battle
with
secularism
has
to
be
fought
it
must
be
fought
the
church
and
eminently
by
our
own
church
our
duty
therefore
is
to
fit
ourselves
for
the
encounter
and
we
must
do
this
with
the
cause
of
religion
undertaking
in
its
breadth
and
embracing
all
branches
of
religious
spiritual
and
ethical
well
but
dear
sir
you
have
just
said
that
during
the
most
important
period
of
intellectual
development
when
the
mind
is
receiving
impressions
which
are
likely
to
last
through
life
the
church
ought
to
stand
aside
and
let
the
state
secularism
without
hindrance
are
you
going
to
cultivate
secularism
in
the
young
until
it
becomes
firmly
rooted
and
then
fight
against
it
with
sermons
and
essays
which
your
secularized
young
men
will
not
listen
to
how
do
you
expect
to
impart
religious
spiritual
and
ethical
culture
when
you
have
formally
renounced
your
inestimable
privilege
and
your
sacred
duty
as
a
guide
and
teacher
of
children
you
propose
to
wait
until
your
boys
have
come
to
estate
before
you
attempt
to
exercise
any
influence
upon
them
and
then
when
they
have
grown
up
with
the
idea
that
religious
influence
ought
to
be
avoided
as
one
avoids
pestilence
you
wonder
and
complain
that
they
are
indifferent
to
the
church
and
will
not
hear
you
battle
with
secularism
has
to
be
fought
your
way
of
fighting
is
to
abandon
the
outposts
leave
front
and
rear
and
flanks
unprotected
and
throw
away
your
arms
it
was
one
of
the
peculiarities
of
the
congress
that
whatever
error
was
promulgated
in
the
essays
and
debates
somewhere
in
the
course
of
the
sessions
an
antidote
was
sure
to
be
furnished
this
being
an
illustration
we
suppose
of
the
extreme
toleration
of
opinion
to
which
bishop
clarke
referred
as
in
a
church
fixed
in
its
hence
we
need
not
be
surprised
to
find
in
the
second
proceedings
a
refutation
of
the
educational
theories
propounded
during
the
first
wharton
made
use
of
the
principle
of
secular
schooling
as
a
weapon
of
offence
against
the
vatican
but
when
the
delegates
had
relieved
their
minds
and
vindicated
their
protestant
orthodoxy
by
giving
the
poor
pope
about
as
much
as
he
could
stagger
away
with
they
turned
their
attention
to
their
own
condition
and
one
of
their
first
subjects
of
inquiry
was
what
secular
education
had
done
for
them
the
topic
of
consideration
on
the
second
morning
was
best
methods
of
procuring
and
preparing
candidates
for
the
schenck
of
brooklyn
began
by
stating
that
the
supply
of
candidates
for
holy
orders
was
not
only
inadequate
to
the
needs
of
the
church
but
it
was
falling
off
a
smaller
number
offering
themselves
than
six
or
seven
years
ago
this
said
he
should
excite
the
gravest
concern
of
the
church
and
nobody
seemed
disposed
to
contradict
him
edward
boggs
indeed
presented
some
uncomfortable
statistics
which
tell
the
whole
story
in
the
number
of
resident
presbyters
of
the
episcopal
church
in
the
united
states
was
in
it
was
only
here
then
while
the
population
increases
the
clergy
are
diminishing
a
great
many
reasons
were
suggested
for
the
phenomenon
one
thought
the
question
of
salary
was
at
the
bottom
of
the
evil
another
blamed
mothers
for
not
giving
their
boys
a
taste
for
the
ministry
while
they
were
young
a
third
believed
the
trouble
was
too
little
prayer
and
too
much
quarrelling
over
candles
and
ecclesiastical
millinery
and
more
than
one
hinted
in
the
broadest
terms
that
the
ministry
was
discredited
by
having
too
many
fools
in
it
the
truth
however
which
had
been
vaguely
suggested
by
some
of
the
earlier
speakers
was
plumply
told
by
edward
sullivan
of
chicago
church
said
he
learn
to
supply
the
ranks
of
the
ministry
from
her
own
that
is
to
say
by
giving
the
children
of
the
church
a
christian
education
he
lamented
the
exclusion
of
the
bible
from
some
of
the
common
schools
as
a
national
calamity
not
if
we
understand
him
because
he
has
any
overweening
faith
in
the
efficacy
of
but
because
he
knows
that
when
positive
religious
teaching
is
banished
from
the
school
the
children
can
hardly
fail
to
grow
up
without
any
religious
feeling
whatever
we
establish
parochial
church
he
continued
can
never
solve
this
and
he
might
have
added
that
if
the
teaching
of
secularism
is
to
be
continued
for
a
generation
or
two
longer
the
problem
will
solve
itself
there
will
be
no
need
of
preachers
when
there
cease
to
be
congregations
if
such
an
alarming
phenomenon
as
an
actual
falling
off
in
the
numbers
of
the
clergy
were
noticed
in
our
own
holy
church
it
would
perhaps
occur
to
good
catholics
to
inquire
whether
the
bishops
were
doing
all
that
they
ought
to
do
for
the
souls
of
their
people
but
the
episcopal
congress
at
philadelphia
seems
to
have
been
vexed
with
the
idea
that
the
bishops
were
doing
entirely
too
much
looking
at
the
assemblage
from
the
outside
we
can
not
pretend
to
see
the
of
opinion
or
to
comprehend
the
denominational
politics
but
it
was
plain
both
from
the
tone
of
the
addresses
in
the
session
set
apart
for
considering
the
and
extent
of
episcopal
and
from
the
manner
in
which
some
of
the
remarks
of
the
speakers
were
received
that
a
jealousy
of
episcopal
authority
prevailed
with
considerable
bitterness
vinton
of
boston
drew
a
parallel
between
the
government
of
the
church
and
the
government
of
the
state
both
were
ruled
by
executives
appointed
by
law
and
controlled
by
law
and
in
each
case
the
chief
officer
acted
by
the
assumed
authority
of
those
he
governed
the
bishops
therefore
we
infer
have
just
as
much
power
as
the
people
choose
to
give
them
and
we
see
no
reason
why
the
congregations
should
not
enlarge
and
restrict
that
power
at
pleasure
make
a
new
constitution
if
they
wish
every
year
and
treat
their
prelates
as
the
savage
treats
his
idol
which
he
sets
upon
an
altar
for
worship
in
the
morning
and
if
things
go
not
well
with
him
kicks
into
the
kennel
at
night
indeed
since
the
foundation
of
the
anglican
church
the
episcopate
has
always
been
treated
with
scant
ceremony
vinton
tells
us
that
it
is
a
reflex
of
the
political
organization
and
as
that
has
varied
a
great
deal
in
england
and
america
and
is
not
unlikely
in
the
course
of
time
to
vary
a
great
deal
more
we
must
not
be
surprised
to
find
the
system
undergoing
many
strange
modifications
and
holding
out
the
promise
of
further
change
indefinitely
in
the
primitive
church
the
episcopacy
was
a
despotism
in
the
anglican
church
it
is
an
ecclesiastical
in
the
protestant
episcopal
church
of
america
where
the
exigencies
of
politics
have
to
be
considered
it
is
well
that
is
just
what
the
congress
tried
in
vain
to
determine
for
one
thing
vinton
and
other
speakers
after
him
laid
great
stress
upon
the
fact
that
its
authority
was
carefully
circumscribed
by
statute
and
that
the
church
was
a
corporation
though
whence
it
derived
its
charter
nobody
was
good
enough
to
tell
us
in
truth
we
did
not
find
the
proceedings
edifying
vinton
declared
that
an
organic
evil
of
the
church
constitution
more
of
mischief
and
sorrow
to
the
body
of
christ
than
any
or
all
of
the
evils
besides
that
our
age
makes
possible
was
the
liability
of
bishops
to
grow
arrogant
of
power
to
make
their
authority
troublesome
to
put
on
idle
pomp
and
set
themselves
conspicuous
difference
from
the
taste
the
traditions
the
educated
and
intelligent
convictions
which
the
providence
of
god
has
caused
to
rule
in
this
fulton
of
indianapolis
inveighed
with
warmth
against
any
bishop
who
ventured
to
intrude
into
another
diocese
and
remarked
that
bishops
were
never
at
home
unless
they
were
a
bishop
continued
the
doctor
is
subject
to
civil
law
he
should
be
tried
for
violation
of
the
ninth
commandment
if
he
wilfully
slander
a
clergyman
either
in
or
out
of
his
own
diocese
bishops
must
not
affect
infallibility
in
doctrinal
utterances
they
must
remember
that
in
more
than
one
respect
they
and
their
presbyters
are
equals
a
bishop
who
would
be
respected
must
respect
the
rights
of
other
bishops
not
being
an
episcopal
busybody
in
other
sees
goodwin
of
philadelphia
thought
that
what
our
lord
meant
to
have
was
moderate
washburn
of
new
york
believed
that
even
the
powers
granted
to
the
apostles
were
not
exclusive
and
that
ever
since
the
apostolic
age
these
powers
had
been
gradually
more
and
more
distributed
until
now
we
should
think
they
must
be
so
finely
divided
that
no
fragment
of
them
is
anywhere
visible
in
the
episcopal
church
lewis
convulsed
the
house
with
laughter
by
a
speech
in
which
he
declared
that
the
bishops
had
been
so
hand
and
foot
by
conventions
and
canons
that
it
was
wonderful
they
had
time
to
do
anything
but
find
out
what
they
must
not
and
he
called
upon
the
church
to
those
bands
and
let
the
bishops
we
quote
from
the
report
of
his
remarks
in
the
will
they
do
he
would
tell
them
what
they
would
do
he
had
at
home
in
his
yard
six
chickens
about
he
had
placed
among
them
a
turkey
big
enough
to
eat
any
of
them
up
but
they
all
flew
at
him
one
little
fellow
pecked
him
and
spurred
him
savagely
the
turkey
looked
on
in
perfect
astonishment
apparently
but
at
length
he
spread
out
his
wings
and
literally
upon
him
from
that
day
to
this
whenever
that
turkey
stirs
these
chickens
can
not
be
kept
from
following
him
and
this
is
just
what
will
happen
in
the
church
if
we
will
only
let
our
bishops
all
this
was
the
cause
of
much
innocent
hilarity
among
the
brethren
but
we
fear
that
it
was
to
lewis
that
the
referred
the
next
week
in
the
following
solemn
strain
is
a
sad
circumstance
that
the
ministry
has
in
it
here
and
there
a
professional
joker
and
cheap
and
one
of
the
most
tedious
and
least
estimable
types
of
foolishness
that
try
christian
endurance
and
vex
religious
families
it
is
to
be
hoped
no
such
buffoon
will
ever
propose
himself
as
clown
to
the
church
congress
and
short
of
that
will
it
be
wise
to
confer
the
award
of
the
heartiest
and
loudest
applause
on
a
sort
of
comic
pleasantry
and
not
which
at
best
is
outdone
in
its
own
line
in
whole
columns
of
daily
newspapers
we
may
smile
because
it
can
not
be
helped
but
we
can
surely
reserve
our
plaudits
if
they
must
be
given
at
all
for
that
species
of
superiority
which
manifests
a
chaste
refinement
and
suits
tastes
that
are
intellectual
rather
than
clearly
there
was
a
great
deal
more
in
these
essays
on
the
limitations
of
episcopal
authority
than
met
the
profane
eye
who
are
the
trespassers
upon
other
sheepfolds
and
the
busybodies
and
the
slanderers
and
the
pompous
bishops
and
the
infallible
bishops
and
the
bishops
who
think
themselves
better
than
their
presbyters
it
is
not
for
us
to
inquire
neither
perhaps
would
it
be
decorous
to
ask
how
the
ten
or
twelve
bishops
in
the
congress
none
of
whom
opened
their
mouths
during
the
debate
enjoyed
the
session
but
there
is
excellent
reason
to
believe
that
the
presbyters
had
a
very
pleasant
day
singing
the
opening
hymn
in
the
morning
gracious
spirit
heavenly
dove
with
peculiar
unction
and
joyously
dismissing
their
right
reverend
fathers
in
the
afternoon
with
the
verses
forth
ye
heralds
in
my
if
the
bishops
are
in
disrepute
and
the
inferior
clergy
are
falling
away
it
can
hardly
be
necessary
to
tell
us
that
the
church
has
no
real
hold
upon
the
people
that
follows
as
a
matter
of
course
accordingly
the
most
interesting
of
the
debates
were
on
the
best
methods
of
giving
vitality
to
the
work
of
the
church
on
ministrations
to
the
laboring
classes
on
free
churches
and
free
preaching
on
the
abuses
of
the
new
system
and
on
the
need
of
something
equivalent
to
the
preaching
orders
and
congregations
of
our
own
church
of
all
the
papers
read
at
the
congress
the
only
one
which
was
received
with
what
we
may
fairly
call
enthusiasm
was
an
essay
by
francis
wells
editor
of
the
philadelphia
on
the
system
and
free
preaching
at
the
close
of
which
one
of
the
reverend
delegates
jumped
upon
a
bench
and
led
the
assembly
in
three
cheers
we
have
seen
no
report
which
gives
a
fair
abstract
of
paper
or
even
explains
what
practical
suggestions
he
had
to
offer
so
that
it
is
impossible
to
understand
what
it
was
that
moved
the
feelings
of
the
congress
but
if
he
drew
a
faithful
picture
of
the
average
episcopal
church
of
our
day
he
may
well
have
startled
his
audience
chief
trouble
he
said
in
the
spirit
of
exclusiveness
which
eyes
the
fashion
of
the
dress
and
warns
off
strangers
with
a
cold
he
was
quite
right
in
holding
that
the
renting
of
pews
and
the
expenditure
of
large
sums
of
money
for
the
adornment
of
the
house
of
god
are
not
necessarily
obstacles
to
the
influence
of
the
church
over
the
masses
our
own
experience
proves
that
what
poor
and
ragged
sinner
was
ever
repelled
from
a
catholic
church
by
imposing
architecture
or
gorgeous
windows
or
the
blazing
magnificence
of
lighted
altars
or
the
strains
of
costly
music
the
rich
have
their
pews
at
least
in
this
country
where
it
is
only
by
that
we
can
meet
the
necessary
expenses
of
the
parish
but
the
most
wretched
beggar
feels
that
he
is
welcome
at
all
times
in
the
splendid
temple
and
he
may
kneel
there
feasting
the
senses
if
he
pleases
as
well
as
refreshing
the
soul
without
fear
that
his
more
comfortable
neighbor
will
stare
at
his
humble
garments
whatever
the
character
of
our
churches
it
is
always
the
poor
who
fill
them
it
never
occurs
to
a
catholic
that
the
people
who
pay
acquire
any
proprietorship
in
the
house
of
god
or
have
any
better
right
there
than
those
who
pay
nothing
the
sermons
are
never
made
for
the
rich
and
the
holy
sacrifice
is
offered
for
all
indiscriminately
but
in
the
episcopal
church
how
different
it
is
imagine
the
feelings
of
a
mechanic
who
approaches
one
of
the
luxurious
temples
in
his
patched
and
stained
working
trowsers
and
threadbare
coat
carriages
are
setting
down
the
at
the
door
every
lady
dressed
in
the
extreme
of
fashion
every
gentleman
carefully
arrayed
by
an
expensive
tailor
a
sexton
with
rather
more
dignity
than
an
average
bishop
receives
the
distinguished
arrivals
just
inside
the
lobby
and
scrutinizes
strangers
with
the
air
of
an
expert
who
has
learned
by
long
experience
in
the
highest
circles
just
what
kind
of
company
every
casual
visitor
has
probably
been
in
the
habit
of
keeping
the
interior
of
the
church
somehow
suggests
a
parlor
furnished
in
the
latest
style
of
imitation
antique
the
upholstery
is
a
marvel
of
comfort
the
pleasantly
subdued
light
suits
the
eyes
and
softens
the
complexions
of
christians
who
have
been
up
late
dancing
a
decorous
quiet
pervades
the
waiting
congregation
broken
only
by
the
rustle
of
silks
sweeping
up
the
aisles
such
a
handsome
display
of
millinery
can
be
seen
nowhere
else
for
so
little
money
what
is
a
to
do
in
such
a
brilliant
gathering
as
this
he
looks
timidly
at
the
back
seats
and
he
finds
there
perhaps
two
or
three
old
women
parish
pensioners
boys
or
young
men
who
keep
near
the
door
in
order
to
slip
out
quietly
when
they
are
tired
of
the
services
but
nobody
of
his
class
the
prosperous
people
all
around
him
listen
to
the
choir
and
the
reader
and
the
preacher
with
an
indescribable
air
of
proprietorship
in
all
of
them
the
sermon
is
an
elaborate
essay
addressed
to
cultivated
intellects
not
to
his
common
understanding
he
goes
away
with
the
uncomfortable
consciousness
that
he
has
been
intruding
and
feels
like
a
shabby
and
unkempt
person
who
has
strolled
by
mistake
into
the
row
at
the
italian
opera
and
been
turned
out
by
a
is
indeed
hard
to
imagine
said
the
other
day
more
likely
to
make
religion
seem
repelling
to
a
poor
man
than
the
sight
of
one
of
the
gorgeous
edifices
in
which
rich
christians
nowadays
try
to
make
their
way
to
heaven
working
out
salvation
clothed
in
the
height
of
the
fashion
as
a
member
of
a
wealthy
club
in
a
building
in
which
the
amplest
provision
is
made
for
the
gratification
of
all
the
finer
senses
must
seem
to
a
thoughtful
city
mechanic
for
instance
something
in
the
nature
of
a
burlesque
not
that
the
building
is
too
good
for
the
lofty
purpose
to
which
it
is
devoted
for
nobody
ever
gets
an
impression
of
anything
but
solemn
appropriateness
from
a
great
catholic
cathedral
but
that
it
is
the
property
of
a
close
corporation
who
as
it
might
be
said
up
a
to
go
to
the
throne
of
grace
and
share
the
expenses
equally
and
fix
the
rate
so
high
that
only
successful
businessmen
can
but
we
heed
not
enlarge
upon
the
prevalence
of
this
evil
the
speakers
at
the
congress
recognized
it
frankly
and
they
are
undoubtedly
aware
though
they
may
not
have
deemed
it
prudent
to
confess
that
the
case
is
growing
more
and
more
serious
all
the
time
as
wealth
concentrates
in
the
large
cities
and
habits
of
luxury
increase
the
protestant
episcopal
church
is
continually
becoming
colder
and
colder
towards
the
poor
no
remedy
that
has
been
proposed
holds
out
the
faintest
promise
of
stopping
this
alarming
decline
no
remedy
proposed
even
meets
the
approbation
of
any
considerable
number
of
the
episcopal
clergy
one
speaker
proposes
a
greater
number
of
free
congregations
and
is
met
by
the
obvious
objection
that
the
result
would
be
a
still
more
lamentable
separation
between
rich
and
poor
with
a
different
class
of
churches
for
each
set
another
recommends
the
bishops
to
send
missionary
preachers
into
every
parish
where
there
seems
to
be
need
of
their
labor
but
does
not
tell
us
where
the
missionaries
are
to
be
found
and
forgets
that
almost
every
parish
in
the
united
states
would
have
to
be
supplied
in
this
way
before
the
evil
could
be
cured
a
third
advises
the
rich
and
poor
to
meet
together
and
fraternize
and
help
each
other
and
a
fourth
calls
for
more
zeal
all
around
all
these
proposals
are
merely
various
ways
of
stating
the
disease
they
do
not
indicate
remedies
perhaps
it
may
occur
to
some
people
that
if
the
catholic
church
and
the
episcopal
church
correspond
so
closely
in
their
outward
operations
both
striving
to
celebrate
divine
worship
with
all
possible
splendor
both
building
costly
churches
and
supporting
them
by
both
employing
highly
paid
choirs
both
keeping
up
a
system
of
parishes
and
if
all
the
while
the
one
gathers
people
of
every
rank
and
condition
into
her
fold
offering
health
and
consolation
to
all
alike
while
the
other
is
constantly
losing
the
affections
of
the
multitude
and
becoming
a
lifeless
creature
of
forms
and
fashions
the
explanation
of
the
difference
after
all
may
be
that
the
holy
ghost
lives
and
works
in
the
one
while
the
other
is
only
the
device
of
man
yule
raps
christmas
we
once
saw
a
picture
of
a
wide
undulating
overspread
with
a
pale
rosy
tint
from
the
west
and
we
thought
it
a
fancy
picture
of
an
arctic
winter
it
hung
in
a
pretty
room
in
a
silesian
the
weather
was
lovely
warm
but
temperate
it
was
and
the
woods
were
full
of
wild
strawberries
and
the
meadows
of
yet
that
landscape
was
simply
silesia
in
the
winter
the
same
place
six
months
later
becomes
a
wilderness
of
snow
what
shall
we
say
of
mecklenburg
then
so
much
farther
to
the
north
of
silesia
but
even
there
winter
brings
merriment
and
as
in
these
countries
there
is
less
work
to
be
got
through
in
the
winter
their
people
associate
the
ideas
of
pleasure
and
holiday
with
the
cold
rather
than
the
warm
weather
in
mecklenburg
spring
summer
and
autumn
mean
work
ploughing
sowing
haying
harvesting
winter
means
fun
and
frolic
dances
parties
weddings
christenings
christmas
new
and
epiphany
presents
gatherings
of
friends
fireside
talk
innocent
games
and
general
merriment
in
a
little
village
in
this
province
the
house
of
emanuel
köhler
was
famous
for
its
jollity
here
were
old
customs
well
kept
up
yet
always
with
decorum
and
a
regard
to
higher
matters
emanuel
was
virtually
master
of
the
estate
of
stelhagen
the
absentee
owner
of
which
was
a
gay
young
officer
who
never
wrote
to
his
agent
except
for
a
new
supply
of
money
clever
and
enlightened
an
agriculturist
as
old
köhler
was
it
was
sometimes
difficult
for
him
to
send
the
required
sums
and
yet
have
enough
to
farm
the
estate
to
his
satisfaction
in
the
language
of
the
country
he
was
called
the
inspector
and
his
house
also
according
to
the
local
custom
was
a
kind
of
informal
agricultural
school
at
the
time
of
our
story
he
had
four
young
men
under
him
who
were
in
all
respects
like
the
apprentices
of
the
good
old
time
and
two
of
his
own
relatives
his
son
and
his
nephew
his
only
daughter
was
busy
helping
her
mother
and
learning
to
be
as
efficient
a
housekeeper
as
the
young
men
to
be
farmers
and
this
nucleus
of
young
society
added
to
the
good
hearty
joviality
and
the
known
always
provided
by
frau
köhler
naturally
made
the
large
cosey
rambling
house
a
pleasant
rendezvous
for
the
neighborhood
the
köhler
household
was
a
host
in
itself
yet
it
always
loved
to
be
reinforced
on
festive
occasions
by
the
good
people
of
the
village
and
farms
within
ten
miles
round
so
also
the
children
whether
poor
or
pretty
well
off
were
all
welcome
at
old
and
knew
the
way
to
the
frau
pantry
as
well
as
they
knew
the
path
to
the
church
or
the
school
all
the
in
the
neighborhood
wanted
to
get
a
place
in
this
house
but
there
was
scarcely
ever
a
vacancy
unless
one
of
the
or
the
married
frau
köhler
and
her
daughter
did
all
the
kitchen
work
themselves
and
the
latter
a
thoughtful
girl
though
she
was
only
fifteen
studied
books
and
maps
but
her
studies
never
interfered
with
the
more
necessary
knowledge
that
a
girl
should
have
when
as
rika
she
has
to
depend
upon
herself
for
everything
in
the
country
in
the
mecklenburg
of
even
a
very
few
years
ago
everything
was
and
a
supply
of
things
from
the
large
town
twenty
or
thirty
miles
off
was
the
event
of
a
such
things
came
as
and
though
fancy
things
came
every
christmas
even
they
were
carefully
and
sacredly
kept
as
tokens
of
that
miraculous
strange
bewildering
world
outside
in
which
people
wore
their
silk
dresses
every
day
and
bought
everything
they
wanted
at
large
shops
a
few
steps
from
their
own
houses
frau
köhler
often
wondered
what
other
women
did
who
had
no
to
manage
no
spinning
or
knitting
or
cooking
or
to
do
and
when
her
daughter
rika
suggested
that
they
probably
read
and
studied
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
and
said
care
child
women
ought
to
attend
to
work
studying
is
a
the
honest
soul
was
a
type
of
many
an
german
of
whose
wisdom
it
were
well
that
some
of
our
contemporaries
could
avail
themselves
and
when
rika
gently
reminded
her
of
the
story
of
martha
and
mary
she
would
energetically
reply
well
but
take
my
word
for
it
child
there
was
a
woman
more
blessed
than
mary
and
one
who
was
nearer
yet
to
her
lord
and
we
do
not
hear
of
neglecting
her
house
i
love
to
think
of
that
house
at
nazareth
as
just
a
model
of
household
cleanliness
and
comfort
you
know
otherwise
it
could
not
have
been
a
fitting
place
for
for
though
he
chose
poverty
he
must
needs
have
surrounded
himself
with
spotless
and
rika
as
humble
and
docile
as
she
was
thoughtful
saw
in
this
reverent
and
practical
surmise
a
proof
that
it
is
not
learning
that
comes
nearest
to
the
heart
of
truth
but
that
clearer
and
directer
knowledge
which
god
gives
to
and
this
particular
christmas
there
was
much
preparation
for
the
family
festival
the
kitchen
was
in
a
ferment
for
a
week
and
mighty
bakings
took
place
gingerbread
and
cake
were
made
and
various
was
done
for
frau
köhler
expected
a
friend
of
her
own
early
home
to
come
and
stay
with
her
this
last
week
of
the
year
this
was
the
good
old
priest
who
had
baptized
her
daughter
for
neither
mother
nor
daughter
were
natives
of
mecklenburg
though
the
latter
had
grown
up
there
and
had
never
since
she
was
six
months
old
gone
beyond
the
limits
of
the
large
estate
which
her
father
administered
frau
köhler
was
a
bavarian
by
birth
and
had
grieved
very
much
when
her
mecklenburg
husband
had
taken
her
to
this
northern
land
where
his
position
and
wages
were
so
good
as
to
make
it
his
duty
to
abide
and
bring
up
his
family
but
the
worthy
old
creature
had
done
a
wonderful
deal
of
good
since
she
had
been
there
and
kept
up
her
faith
as
steadfastly
as
ever
she
had
at
home
frederika
had
been
her
treasure
and
her
comfort
and
between
the
intense
mediæval
firmness
of
belief
and
the
naturally
deep
and
thoughtful
nature
the
little
had
grown
up
a
rare
combination
of
qualities
and
a
model
for
the
young
catholic
womanhood
of
our
stormy
times
the
old
priest
whom
frau
köhler
had
looked
up
to
before
her
marriage
as
her
best
friend
and
whom
rika
had
been
taught
to
revere
from
her
babyhood
had
been
very
sick
and
was
obliged
to
leave
his
parish
for
a
long
holiday
and
rest
his
former
parishioner
was
anxious
that
he
should
see
christmas
kept
in
the
northern
style
more
characteristic
than
the
frenchified
southern
manners
would
now
allow
even
in
her
remote
native
village
civilization
carries
with
it
the
and
the
rule
and
when
young
girls
begin
to
prefer
manchester
prints
and
french
bonnets
to
homespun
and
straw
hats
most
of
the
old
customs
slip
away
from
their
homes
in
the
sturdy
mecklenburg
of
twenty
years
ago
even
after
the
temporary
stir
of
things
were
pretty
much
as
they
had
been
for
centuries
and
it
was
pride
that
his
household
should
be
if
needful
the
last
stronghold
of
the
good
old
usages
he
heartily
acquiesced
in
his
invitation
to
the
southern
guest
and
resolved
to
have
the
best
christmas
that
had
been
known
in
the
country
since
he
had
undertaken
the
care
of
the
stelhagen
estate
in
truth
he
lived
like
a
patriarch
among
his
his
laborers
and
their
families
were
models
of
prosperity
and
content
and
the
children
of
all
the
neighborhood
wished
he
were
their
grandfather
indeed
he
was
godfather
to
half
the
village
babies
born
during
his
stay
there
the
sleighs
of
the
country
were
the
pride
some
were
plain
and
strong
because
their
owners
were
not
rich
enough
to
adorn
them
but
others
were
quite
a
curiosity
to
the
visitor
from
the
south
they
partook
of
the
same
quaintness
as
the
old
yellow
family
coaches
that
took
the
farmers
to
and
weddings
before
the
early
snows
came
on
lumbering
vehicles
these
were
swinging
on
high
like
a
cradle
tied
to
a
couple
of
saplings
in
a
storm
capacious
as
the
on
a
baking
day
seventy
years
old
at
least
barring
the
numerous
patchings
and
mendings
new
lining
or
new
wheel
occasionally
vouchsafed
to
the
venerable
representative
of
the
family
dignity
the
sleighs
were
much
gayer
and
a
little
less
antiquated
because
oftener
used
and
therefore
oftener
worn
out
besides
there
were
fashions
in
sleighs
even
in
this
remote
place
fashions
indigenous
to
the
population
each
individual
of
which
was
capable
of
some
invention
when
sleighs
were
in
question
on
christmas
eve
long
before
it
grew
dark
many
of
these
pretty
or
curious
conveyances
clattered
up
to
the
door
some
were
laden
with
children
two
rows
deep
all
wrapped
in
knitted
jackets
blankets
boas
and
here
and
there
covered
with
a
fur
cap
or
furred
hood
for
knitting
in
this
neighborhood
supplied
all
with
warm
winter
wraps
even
better
than
woven
or
stuffs
do
nowadays
there
were
no
single
sleighs
no
tiny
things
made
to
display
the
rich
toilet
of
the
occupant
and
the
skill
of
the
fast
driver
by
her
side
here
all
were
honest
family
vehicles
full
of
rosy
faces
like
christmas
apples
hearty
men
and
women
who
at
were
almost
as
young
as
their
grandchildren
on
their
bridal
day
and
young
men
and
maidens
who
were
not
afraid
to
dance
and
move
briskly
in
their
plain
loose
and
clothes
nor
to
fall
in
love
with
german
downrightness
and
honest
practical
intentions
most
of
these
sleighs
were
red
picked
out
with
black
or
black
liberally
sprinkled
with
red
some
were
yellow
and
black
some
yellow
and
blue
and
in
most
the
robe
and
cushions
were
of
corresponding
colors
some
of
these
robes
had
eagles
embroidered
in
coarse
patterns
and
thick
wool
while
others
were
of
a
pattern
something
like
those
used
for
and
some
bore
unmistakable
witness
to
the
thrift
of
the
and
were
skilfully
pieced
together
out
of
carpet
curtain
blanket
and
dress
remnants
the
whole
bordered
with
some
inexpensive
fur
one
or
two
sleighs
bore
a
sort
of
the
head
of
a
deer
or
a
fox
or
a
hawk
carved
and
let
into
the
curling
part
of
the
front
while
one
party
who
were
gazed
upon
with
mingled
admiration
and
disapproval
went
so
far
as
to
trail
after
them
for
three
or
four
feet
behind
the
sleigh
and
sweeping
up
the
snow
in
their
wake
a
thick
scarlet
cloth
of
gorgeous
appearance
but
no
very
valuable
texture
this
was
the
doing
of
a
young
fellow
who
had
lately
been
reading
one
or
two
romances
of
chivalry
and
been
much
pleased
with
the
housings
of
the
horses
sweeping
the
ground
as
the
knight
rode
to
the
his
indulgent
old
mother
and
admiring
sisters
had
but
faintly
remonstrated
and
this
was
the
consequence
the
horses
were
not
less
bedecked
than
the
vehicles
silver
bells
hung
from
their
harness
and
belted
their
bodies
in
various
places
shining
plates
of
metal
and
knobs
driven
into
the
leather
made
them
as
gay
as
while
of
variegated
pattern
were
rolled
up
under
the
feet
of
their
masters
ready
for
use
whenever
they
stopped
on
the
road
emanuel
himself
had
gone
to
the
nearest
town
at
which
a
stopped
to
welcome
his
friend
and
special
guest
and
entertained
him
with
a
flow
of
agricultural
information
and
warm
eulogy
of
the
country
through
which
they
were
speeding
on
their
way
home
he
arrived
at
stelhagen
before
the
rush
of
country
visitors
and
was
triumphantly
taken
through
every
part
of
the
farm
while
his
meal
was
being
prepared
by
rika
and
the
maids
but
more
than
all
frau
köhler
in
her
delight
actually
made
him
of
the
sacred
secret
chamber
where
stood
the
already
laden
but
unlighted
among
its
attendant
tables
and
dishes
the
old
man
was
as
innocently
charmed
as
a
child
it
reminded
him
so
of
his
own
in
days
when
the
simple
customs
of
germany
were
still
unimpaired
and
when
it
was
the
fashion
to
give
only
really
useful
things
with
due
regard
to
the
condition
and
needs
of
the
recipients
at
the
feasts
to
which
my
people
ask
me
now
said
he
see
children
regaled
with
a
multitude
of
unwholesome
colored
in
boxes
that
cost
quite
as
much
as
the
contents
and
servants
given
cheap
silks
or
paste
jewelry
and
the
friends
or
the
master
and
mistress
themselves
loaded
with
pretty
but
useless
gilded
toys
that
cost
a
great
deal
and
make
more
show
than
their
use
warrants
times
are
sadly
changed
thekla
even
since
you
were
herr
pfarrer
i
have
had
little
chance
and
less
wish
to
see
the
change
and
up
here
i
think
we
still
live
as
sons
after
they
came
out
of
the
ark
said
good
frau
köhler
with
a
broad
smile
at
her
own
wit
as
the
day
wore
on
she
and
rika
left
the
to
care
and
again
busied
themselves
about
the
serious
coming
festivity
she
flew
around
as
active
as
a
fat
sparrow
with
a
under
her
arm
whisking
off
with
nervous
hand
every
speck
of
dust
on
the
or
among
the
few
books
which
lay
conspicuously
on
the
table
in
the
best
room
giving
her
orders
to
the
nimble
maids
welcoming
the
families
of
guests
and
specially
petting
the
children
emanuel
took
the
men
under
his
protection
and
gave
them
tobacco
and
pipes
and
talked
farming
to
them
while
his
own
young
whispered
in
corners
of
the
coming
tree
and
supper
at
last
rika
came
out
from
the
room
where
the
mystery
was
going
on
and
opening
the
door
wide
let
a
flood
of
light
into
the
dark
apartment
beyond
there
was
a
regular
blaze
the
large
tree
stood
on
a
low
table
and
reached
nearly
up
to
the
ceiling
there
were
only
lights
colored
ribbons
and
gilded
walnuts
hung
upon
it
but
it
quite
satisfied
the
expectation
of
the
good
folk
around
it
round
the
room
were
tables
and
stands
of
all
kinds
crowded
together
and
barely
holding
all
the
dishes
apportioned
to
each
member
of
the
party
the
guests
had
secretly
brought
or
sent
their
mutual
presents
one
family
generally
taking
charge
of
its
gifts
and
that
none
might
suspect
the
nature
of
their
own
the
tree
too
was
a
joint
contribution
of
the
several
families
all
had
sent
in
tapers
and
nuts
and
this
it
was
that
made
it
so
full
of
bright
things
and
necessitated
its
being
so
tall
on
the
middle
table
under
the
tree
itself
were
dishes
for
the
köhler
household
each
one
having
a
liberal
allowance
of
apples
nuts
and
gingerbread
besides
these
there
were
parcels
securely
tied
laid
by
the
dishes
and
labelled
with
the
names
of
their
unconscious
owners
köhler
was
seized
upon
by
his
wife
and
daughter
before
anyone
else
was
allowed
to
go
forward
for
in
this
neighborhood
the
head
of
the
house
is
still
considered
in
the
light
of
an
abraham
and
a
compact
parcel
was
put
into
his
hands
by
rika
while
thekla
kissed
him
with
hearty
loudness
next
came
the
guest
whom
rika
led
to
the
prettiest
china
dish
and
presented
with
a
small
packet
leaving
him
to
open
it
at
his
leisure
she
joined
her
young
friends
and
a
scramble
now
began
each
looking
for
his
own
name
in
some
familiar
handwriting
finding
it
and
opening
the
treasure
with
the
eagerness
of
a
child
it
would
be
impossible
to
describe
every
present
that
thus
came
to
view
but
though
many
were
pretty
and
elaborate
none
were
for
mere
show
presently
frau
köhler
was
seen
to
take
possession
of
her
husband
and
pulling
off
his
coat
made
him
try
on
the
he
had
just
drawn
from
his
parcel
she
turned
him
round
like
a
doll
and
clapped
her
hands
in
admiration
at
the
perfect
fit
then
danced
around
to
the
other
end
of
the
room
and
called
out
to
the
maids
bettchen
it
is
your
turn
now
you
have
not
been
forgotten
those
are
your
dishes
where
the
silver
dollars
are
sticking
in
the
the
maids
opened
their
parcels
and
each
found
a
bright
soft
warm
dress
crimson
and
black
then
came
george
the
man
who
did
most
of
the
immediate
work
round
the
house
and
found
a
bright
red
vest
with
steel
buttons
in
his
parcel
frau
köhler
was
busy
looking
at
other
things
when
her
husband
slipped
a
neat
long
packet
on
her
dish
and
as
she
turned
and
saw
the
addition
she
uttered
an
exclamation
of
joy
rika
helped
her
to
unfold
the
stiff
rustling
thing
when
it
turned
out
to
be
a
black
silk
dress
not
every
housewife
in
those
days
had
one
and
her
last
was
nearly
worn
out
then
the
old
priest
came
forward
to
show
the
company
his
christmas
box
and
what
do
you
think
it
was
there
was
no
doubt
as
to
where
it
came
from
it
was
a
set
of
and
in
such
taste
as
was
scarcely
to
be
expected
in
that
time
and
neighborhood
rika
had
designed
it
and
her
mother
had
worked
it
but
many
an
anxious
debate
had
there
been
over
it
as
the
frau
inspectorin
had
been
at
first
quite
vexed
at
what
she
called
its
plainness
it
was
composed
of
five
thick
ribbons
two
inches
wide
and
fifteen
long
there
was
a
red
a
green
a
white
a
purple
and
a
black
ribbon
and
on
each
was
embroidered
a
motto
on
the
red
and
green
in
gold
on
the
white
in
red
and
on
the
black
and
purple
in
silver
the
letters
were
german
though
the
mottoes
were
in
latin
and
each
of
the
five
referred
to
one
of
these
events
our
birth
death
resurrection
and
ascension
and
the
coming
of
the
holy
ghost
at
the
end
of
each
ribbon
instead
of
fringe
or
tassels
hung
a
cross
of
pure
silver
into
the
ring
of
which
the
ribbon
was
loosely
gathered
every
one
crowded
round
this
novel
christmas
gift
and
examined
it
with
an
admiration
equally
gratifying
to
the
giver
and
the
receiver
but
jolly
voice
soon
broke
the
spell
by
saying
fine
presents
are
very
delightful
to
receive
no
doubt
and
the
would
not
have
been
happy
without
some
such
thing
but
we
are
all
mortal
and
i
have
not
forgotten
that
my
guest
has
feet
and
hands
and
needs
warmth
and
comfort
as
much
as
we
of
grosser
and
with
this
he
thrust
a
large
parcel
into
the
arms
every
one
laughed
and
helped
him
to
open
it
every
one
was
curious
to
see
its
contents
they
were
indeed
of
a
most
substantial
and
useful
kind
a
of
scarlet
cloth
lined
and
bordered
with
fur
and
a
pair
of
huge
sealskin
gloves
scarcely
had
the
parcel
been
opened
when
a
hum
of
measured
sound
was
heard
outside
and
presently
a
christmas
carol
was
distinctly
audible
everyone
knew
the
words
and
many
joined
in
the
song
before
the
singers
became
visible
then
the
door
opened
and
a
troop
of
children
came
in
dressed
in
warm
white
furs
and
woollen
wrappings
and
carrying
tapers
and
in
their
hands
they
sang
a
second
carol
quaint
and
rustic
in
its
words
but
skilfully
set
to
anything
but
archaic
music
and
then
in
honor
of
their
southern
guest
they
began
song
of
the
evening
a
few
stanzas
from
the
to
the
blessed
virgin
by
the
minnesinger
gottfried
of
strasburg
the
translation
of
which
according
to
kroeger
runs
thus
xxv
thee
hath
clothed
with
raiments
seven
on
thy
pure
body
drawn
from
heaven
hath
put
them
even
when
thou
wast
first
created
the
first
one
chastity
is
named
the
second
is
as
virtue
famed
the
third
is
claimed
as
courtesy
well
mated
the
fourth
dress
is
humility
the
fifth
is
known
as
pity
the
sixth
one
faith
clings
close
to
thee
the
seventh
noble
modesty
leads
gratefully
thee
in
the
path
of
duty
xxvii
sun
thou
moon
thou
star
so
fair
god
took
thee
from
his
own
side
there
here
to
prepare
the
birth
of
christ
within
thee
for
that
his
loved
child
and
thine
which
is
our
life
and
sunshine
our
bread
and
wine
to
stay
chaste
he
did
win
thee
so
that
thorns
could
never
touch
thy
fruitful
branches
his
burning
love
for
thee
did
vouch
he
kept
thee
from
all
sins
that
crouch
a
golden
couch
secured
by
his
trenches
xlvii
now
thou
throne
that
thou
gavest
birth
to
him
who
won
our
cause
thy
son
our
saviour
and
our
blessing
xlviii
now
o
thou
sunshine
mild
that
on
thy
blessed
breasts
there
smiled
little
child
its
earthly
destination
rejoice
that
then
drew
near
to
thee
from
foreign
lands
the
wise
kings
three
noble
and
free
to
bring
their
adoration
to
thee
and
to
that
blessed
child
with
many
a
graceful
rejoice
now
that
the
star
beguiled
and
to
that
place
their
pathway
smiled
where
with
thy
child
they
worshipped
thy
sweet
are
not
so
utterly
unknowing
of
all
gentle
and
learned
pursuits
as
you
would
have
had
me
believe
said
the
to
frau
köhler
is
not
every
child
in
bavaria
that
could
sing
so
well
this
poem
so
graceful
in
its
rhyming
and
so
devout
in
its
allusions
our
old
poetry
the
most
national
peculiar
to
our
country
is
too
much
superseded
by
noisy
modern
rhymes
or
sentimental
ballads
copied
from
foreign
models
have
you
any
unknown
scholar
among
your
farmers
and
agents
who
you
told
me
made
up
a
hearty
but
not
a
learned
society
here
said
frau
köhler
is
the
heldmann
who
is
always
poring
over
old
useless
books
but
never
can
have
a
good
dinner
unless
his
friends
send
it
to
him
poor
man
he
is
a
bachelor
and
can
not
afford
to
have
a
housekeeper
and
then
there
is
one
of
our
young
gentlemen
who
köhler
says
is
always
in
the
clouds
and
who
spends
all
his
spare
time
with
heldmann
while
the
other
boys
spend
theirs
with
their
pretty
rosy
neighbors
by
the
way
heldmann
is
coming
but
he
said
he
could
not
come
till
late
as
he
had
some
important
business
which
would
detain
him
for
an
hour
or
forget
our
rika
mother
said
emanuel
not
heeding
the
last
part
of
his
sentence
is
as
wise
as
any
of
them
though
she
says
so
little
she
knows
all
the
old
legends
and
poetry
and
more
besides
i
designed
that
said
the
frau
inspectorin
proudly
she
had
found
out
since
it
had
been
so
admired
that
her
instinct
had
guided
her
aright
in
the
design
but
rika
hearing
her
name
mentioned
had
slipped
away
among
the
children
and
was
laying
their
tapers
and
away
preparatory
to
giving
them
cakes
and
fruit
this
was
quite
a
ceremony
and
when
they
were
ready
frau
köhler
handing
the
large
dish
of
nuts
to
the
begged
him
to
distribute
them
while
she
took
charge
of
the
gingerbread
and
rika
of
the
apples
it
was
funny
to
see
the
solemn
expectancy
with
which
the
children
brought
out
dishes
mugs
pitchers
in
which
to
receive
these
christmas
gifts
some
of
the
girls
held
out
their
aprons
as
more
convenient
and
capacious
receptacles
than
anything
else
they
could
lay
hands
on
one
boy
brought
a
large
birthday
cup
and
another
a
wooden
another
a
small
churn
while
a
fourth
had
carried
off
his
and
a
fifth
calmly
handed
up
a
which
he
evidently
expected
to
get
filled
to
the
brim
as
frau
köhler
came
to
one
of
the
children
she
said
i
saw
you
in
the
orchard
last
autumn
stealing
our
apples
now
naughty
boys
must
not
expect
to
get
apples
at
christmas
if
they
take
them
at
other
times
so
rika
give
him
any
he
shall
have
one
piece
of
gingerbread
a
piteous
disclaimer
met
this
sentence
but
the
thrust
a
double
quantity
of
nuts
into
the
basket
and
passed
on
then
once
again
frau
köhler
stopped
and
said
i
see
you
fighting
with
another
boy
in
the
churchyard
two
weeks
ago
and
told
you
that
santa
claus
would
forget
you
when
he
came
to
fill
the
stockings
on
christmas
night
i
shall
not
give
you
any
knows
we
made
it
up
again
whined
the
boy
and
franz
with
a
roguish
look
peeped
out
from
his
place
in
the
row
and
said
we
did
frau
so
both
got
their
gingerbread
at
last
this
distribution
being
over
the
children
laden
with
their
gifts
went
home
to
their
own
various
firesides
not
without
many
thanks
to
the
within
the
and
his
parting
reminder
as
he
showed
them
the
stars
up
at
own
lighted
up
with
thousands
of
tapers
children
and
at
the
smooth
white
snow
spread
over
the
fields
that
is
the
white
which
he
has
spread
for
the
beautiful
gifts
which
spring
and
summer
and
autumn
are
going
to
bring
you
all
in
his
own
good
then
came
another
batch
of
visitors
the
old
sick
and
infirm
people
of
the
village
the
the
the
wooden
bowl
and
spoon
carvers
and
the
makers
of
wooden
shoes
and
some
who
could
no
longer
work
but
had
been
faithful
and
industrious
in
their
time
they
had
something
of
the
old
costume
on
the
men
wore
blue
yarn
stockings
and
stout
gray
they
had
left
their
outside
for
the
snow
was
deep
and
soft
and
they
needed
them
all
the
winter
and
through
most
of
the
spring
and
the
women
had
large
nodding
caps
and
black
silk
handkerchiefs
folded
across
their
bosoms
each
of
these
old
people
got
a
large
loaf
of
plain
cake
and
some
good
stout
flannel
and
these
things
according
to
the
local
etiquette
the
inspector
himself
delivered
to
them
as
the
representative
of
his
young
master
this
distribution
was
an
old
custom
on
the
stelhagen
estate
and
though
the
present
owner
was
careless
enough
in
many
things
he
wished
this
usage
to
be
always
kept
up
even
if
he
had
not
it
is
not
likely
that
as
long
as
köhler
was
inspector
the
old
people
would
not
have
been
able
to
rely
on
the
customary
christmas
gift
after
this
some
bustle
occurred
and
two
or
three
people
went
and
stationed
themselves
outside
the
door
presently
the
expectant
company
within
were
startled
by
a
loud
rap
and
the
door
flew
open
a
parcel
was
flung
in
and
a
voice
cried
out
rap
this
was
a
pair
of
slippers
for
the
inspector
no
one
knew
where
they
came
from
no
one
had
sent
them
yule
raps
are
supposed
to
be
magical
impersonal
causes
of
tangible
effects
so
every
one
looked
innocent
and
astonished
as
became
good
mecklenburgers
under
christmas
circumstances
rap
again
and
the
door
opened
a
second
time
a
embroidered
with
his
initials
was
evolved
out
of
a
cumbrous
packet
by
one
of
the
young
apprentices
and
scarcely
had
he
put
it
on
than
another
thundering
knock
sounded
on
the
door
rap
was
shouted
again
and
in
flew
a
heavy
package
it
was
a
book
with
illustrations
of
travel
scenes
in
the
east
and
was
directed
to
rika
rap
this
time
it
was
only
a
little
square
envelope
with
a
ticket
referring
frau
köhler
to
another
ticket
up
in
the
bureau
drawer
in
her
bedroom
but
when
one
of
the
boys
found
it
that
referred
again
to
another
ticket
in
the
cellar
and
when
another
boy
brought
this
to
light
it
mysteriously
referred
her
to
her
pocket
here
at
last
the
hidden
thing
was
revealed
an
embroidered
collar
and
a
pair
of
larger
cuffs
to
match
köhler
had
no
idea
what
sprite
had
put
it
there
so
he
said
rap
and
this
time
it
was
for
the
guest
a
black
velvet
warm
and
clinging
then
came
various
things
all
heralded
by
the
same
warning
cry
of
rap
and
a
knock
at
the
door
generally
in
strong
voice
the
two
maids
got
the
packages
ready
and
peeped
in
at
the
keyhole
to
see
when
it
was
time
to
vary
the
sensation
by
throwing
in
another
present
again
a
came
rolling
in
ringing
as
it
bounded
on
with
just
a
few
bands
of
soft
stuff
and
silver
paper
muffling
its
sound
once
a
large
meerschaum
pipe
was
laid
gently
at
the
threshold
of
the
door
and
one
of
the
apprentices
fetched
it
as
carefully
then
a
violin
was
pushed
through
the
door
and
the
eager
face
of
the
one
for
whom
it
was
intended
peeped
anxiously
over
his
shoulder
wondering
if
any
one
else
were
the
happy
destined
one
and
as
much
surprised
as
delighted
when
he
found
it
was
himself
that
violin
has
since
been
heard
in
many
a
large
and
populous
town
and
though
its
owner
did
not
become
as
as
paganini
or
sivori
he
did
not
love
his
art
less
faithfully
and
exclusively
we
can
not
enumerate
all
the
gifts
which
yule
brought
round
this
year
but
before
the
evening
was
over
a
different
voice
cried
out
the
magic
words
rap
and
the
door
being
slightly
opened
and
quickly
closed
again
a
tiny
white
silky
dog
stood
trembling
on
the
carpet
rika
jumped
up
and
ran
to
take
it
in
her
arms
then
pulling
open
the
door
heldmann
herr
heldmann
she
cried
know
it
is
you
the
schoolmaster
came
forward
his
rough
face
glowing
with
the
cold
through
which
he
had
just
come
promised
you
a
dog
rika
he
said
rather
awkwardly
they
would
not
let
me
have
it
till
this
very
day
and
i
had
no
time
to
go
for
it
but
this
evening
i
kept
it
under
my
coat
all
the
time
so
it
is
quite
warm
it
is
only
two
months
rika
was
in
ecstasies
she
declared
this
was
worth
all
her
christmas
presents
and
then
rewarded
herr
heldmann
by
telling
him
how
well
the
children
had
done
their
part
and
how
delightfully
surprised
the
had
been
the
two
men
were
soon
in
a
deep
conversation
on
subjects
dear
and
familiar
to
both
and
the
company
gradually
dissolved
again
into
little
knots
and
groups
many
took
their
leave
as
their
homes
were
distant
and
they
did
not
wish
to
be
too
late
but
for
all
an
informal
supper
was
laid
in
the
vast
kitchen
and
by
degrees
most
of
the
good
things
on
the
table
were
sensibly
diminished
the
wife
and
daughter
and
the
herr
pfarrer
with
half
a
dozen
others
and
a
few
children
did
not
leave
the
whose
tapers
were
constantly
attended
to
and
replaced
when
necessary
other
were
also
lighted
tall
columns
of
yellow
wax
made
on
purpose
for
this
occasion
as
the
household
and
its
inmates
were
left
to
themselves
the
children
began
asking
for
their
accustomed
treat
the
stories
that
all
children
have
been
fond
of
since
the
world
began
no
land
is
so
rich
in
the
romance
of
childhood
as
germany
both
north
and
south
there
everything
is
personified
and
as
an
english
writer
lately
said
wonderful
histories
are
connected
with
the
in
the
forests
the
beloved
and
venerated
it
be
yet
summer
the
child
sees
in
fancy
the
beautiful
adorned
with
sparkling
things
as
the
gospel
is
adorned
with
promises
and
hopes
rich
in
gifts
as
the
three
kings
were
rich
pointing
to
heaven
as
the
angel
pointed
bright
as
those
very
heavens
were
bright
with
messengers
crowned
with
gold
as
the
word
was
crowned
odorous
like
the
frankincense
sparkling
like
the
star
spreading
forth
its
arms
full
of
peace
and
on
every
side
holding
out
gifts
and
promises
for
the
blessed
the
hallowed
the
consecrated
night
is
the
of
germany
that
land
of
beautiful
family
festivals
has
given
christmas
a
double
significance
and
merged
into
its
memories
all
the
graceful
shadowy
legends
of
the
dead
mythology
of
the
fatherland
the
german
child
is
reared
in
the
midst
of
which
are
only
truths
translated
into
besides
the
old
standard
ones
every
neighborhood
has
its
own
local
tales
every
family
its
own
additions
or
inventions
every
young
mother
herself
but
a
step
removed
from
childhood
with
all
her
tender
imaginations
still
stirring
and
her
lifted
into
greater
beauty
because
they
are
but
just
left
behind
makes
new
stories
for
her
little
ones
and
finds
in
every
flower
a
new
fairy
in
every
brook
a
new
voice
and
yet
the
old
tales
still
charm
the
little
ones
and
the
yearly
coming
of
king
winter
brings
the
old
worn
stories
round
again
so
emanuel
köhler
told
the
which
the
children
had
listened
to
every
christmas
with
delight
about
the
journey
of
king
winter
from
his
kingdom
at
the
north
pole
and
how
he
put
on
his
crown
with
tall
spikes
of
icicles
and
wrapped
himself
in
his
wide
which
to
him
is
as
precious
and
as
warm
as
ermine
now
said
the
host
is
some
one
here
who
can
tell
you
a
far
more
beautiful
story
than
mine
some
one
greater
than
the
comes
too
every
year
a
the
white
christ
whom
our
ancestors
the
old
norse
and
teutonic
warriors
learned
to
see
and
adore
where
they
had
only
seen
and
worshipped
the
god
of
war
and
the
god
of
thunder
before
ask
him
to
tell
you
a
and
the
old
stroked
the
head
of
the
child
nearest
to
him
as
the
little
one
looked
shyly
up
into
his
face
mutely
endorsing
appeal
he
told
them
that
they
must
already
know
the
story
of
the
first
christmas
night
and
so
he
would
only
tell
them
how
the
news
that
the
angels
told
the
shepherds
on
the
hills
came
long
centuries
after
to
others
as
as
the
shepherds
and
by
means
almost
as
wonderful
he
repeated
to
them
from
memory
the
words
of
an
english
which
he
said
he
had
loved
ever
since
he
came
across
them
and
which
made
the
picture
he
best
loved
to
talk
on
at
little
infant
frame
white
as
a
on
the
lap
of
winter
light
almost
as
a
on
the
chill
night
air
smooth
as
the
cushioned
drift
of
snow
which
the
wind
has
lightly
strewn
outside
the
walls
of
bethlehem
is
at
this
moment
holding
within
itself
as
if
it
were
of
adamantine
rock
the
fires
of
the
beatific
the
little
white
lily
is
blooming
below
the
greater
one
an
offshoot
of
its
stem
and
a
faithful
copy
leaf
for
leaf
petal
for
petal
white
for
white
powdered
with
the
same
golden
dust
meeting
the
morning
with
the
same
fragrance
which
is
like
no
other
than
their
own
there
was
a
more
marvellous
tale
than
any
they
had
heard
about
the
was
a
flower
and
his
blessed
mother
was
a
flower
holy
lilies
in
the
garden
of
god
blossoming
rods
like
fruitful
roots
stately
cedars
and
it
was
a
very
happy
thing
to
know
and
feel
all
this
as
we
do
but
many
millions
of
men
know
nothing
of
it
and
centuries
ago
even
our
forefathers
in
these
forests
knew
nothing
of
it
he
continued
was
a
distant
island
where
men
of
our
race
lived
which
did
not
receive
the
faith
till
long
after
germany
and
france
and
britain
were
christian
and
even
had
cathedrals
and
cloisters
and
schools
in
abundance
it
was
two
hundred
years
after
charlemagne
who
was
a
frankish
and
therefore
a
german
sovereign
founded
the
palatine
schools
and
conferred
with
the
learned
english
monk
alcuin
this
distant
pagan
island
was
iceland
the
norsemen
there
were
a
wild
fierce
warlike
people
free
from
any
foreign
government
and
just
the
kind
of
heroes
that
their
old
mythology
represented
them
as
becoming
in
their
future
disembodied
life
they
had
their
scalds
or
their
bards
who
were
both
poets
and
historians
who
kept
up
their
spirit
by
singing
wild
songs
about
their
ancestors
and
the
battles
they
had
won
they
were
all
pagans
and
thought
the
forgiveness
of
injuries
very
mean
well
one
day
the
eve
of
when
it
was
terribly
cold
and
cheerless
an
old
scald
sat
in
his
rough
hut
with
a
flickering
light
before
him
chanting
one
of
his
wild
heathen
songs
and
his
daughter
a
beautiful
girl
sat
at
the
plank
table
near
him
busy
with
some
work
during
an
interval
of
his
song
she
raised
her
eyes
and
said
to
him
there
must
be
something
beyond
all
that
something
greater
and
child
said
the
old
man
with
a
kind
of
impatient
wonder
should
you
think
so
many
things
different
there
may
be
just
as
there
are
different
kinds
of
men
and
different
kinds
of
beasts
and
different
kinds
of
plants
some
for
mastery
and
some
for
thraldom
some
for
the
chase
and
some
for
the
kitchen
or
the
plough
some
for
incantations
and
sacrifices
and
some
for
common
food
but
anything
nobler
than
our
history
there
could
not
be
and
as
for
our
religion
if
there
were
anything
different
or
even
better
it
would
not
suit
our
people
and
so
would
be
no
concern
of
if
it
were
true
father
and
ours
not
true
what
then
ask
the
question
child
what
was
good
enough
for
the
wise
and
brave
northmen
who
fled
here
that
they
might
be
free
to
fight
and
worship
according
to
their
fancy
is
good
enough
for
their
you
know
yourself
father
persisted
the
maiden
those
whom
our
poetical
traditions
call
gods
were
men
heroes
and
patriots
who
taught
our
forefathers
various
arts
and
guided
them
safely
across
deserts
and
through
forests
in
their
long
long
migration
but
still
only
men
our
chieftains
of
might
as
well
become
gods
to
our
if
the
old
leaders
have
become
so
to
us
wise
as
they
were
they
could
not
command
the
frozen
seas
to
open
a
way
for
their
ships
nor
make
the
sun
rise
earlier
in
the
long
winter
nor
compel
the
cutting
to
cease
if
they
could
not
do
such
things
they
must
have
been
very
far
from
is
true
said
the
old
man
those
great
chieftains
were
in
the
dim
ages
we
can
scarcely
count
back
to
men
like
us
but
the
gods
who
taught
them
those
very
arts
took
them
up
to
live
with
them
as
long
as
their
own
heaven
might
last
and
made
them
equal
to
themselves
you
know
even
paradise
itself
is
to
come
to
an
end
some
our
legends
say
father
but
that
too
makes
it
seem
as
if
these
gods
were
only
another
order
of
mortal
beings
stronger
but
not
better
than
we
are
and
hiding
from
us
the
true
changeless
heaven
far
above
them
for
surely
that
which
changes
can
not
be
divine
and
then
our
legends
say
that
evil
is
to
triumph
when
heaven
and
earth
come
to
an
end
true
they
say
there
will
be
a
renewal
of
all
things
after
that
and
that
no
doubt
means
that
good
will
be
uppermost
very
likely
all
the
things
spoken
of
in
our
eddas
are
only
signs
of
other
things
which
we
could
not
daughter
continued
these
questionings
and
speculations
the
scald
answering
them
as
best
he
could
had
listened
with
evident
admiration
and
approval
to
her
impassioned
speech
but
he
was
willing
to
test
her
faith
in
her
own
womanhood
to
the
utmost
she
now
seemed
wrapt
in
her
own
thoughts
but
after
a
short
pause
said
would
not
be
inspiration
in
which
i
should
believe
it
would
be
a
message
from
him
who
has
put
this
belief
already
into
my
heart
some
one
greater
than
all
has
spoken
to
my
inmost
heart
and
i
am
ready
to
believe
but
the
messenger
that
is
to
put
it
into
words
and
tell
me
what
to
do
has
not
was
a
silence
and
the
wind
and
the
sea
roared
without
the
old
man
shaded
the
flickering
light
with
his
hand
and
gazed
at
his
daughter
who
was
sitting
with
her
hands
clasped
in
her
lap
he
thought
that
she
herself
must
have
received
some
divine
illumination
for
the
norsemen
believed
in
the
prophetic
gifts
of
some
of
their
women
his
own
mind
more
cultivated
than
that
of
the
saw
through
the
symbolic
character
of
many
of
the
very
myths
he
sang
and
tended
vaguely
to
belief
in
a
higher
and
hidden
circle
of
things
infinite
true
and
eternal
but
then
the
northern
mind
was
naturally
simple
not
prone
to
metaphysical
distinctions
not
analytical
and
subtle
dividing
as
with
the
sword
that
pierceth
between
soul
and
spirit
and
the
old
man
saw
no
use
in
raising
theological
problems
for
which
he
could
offer
no
rational
solution
save
through
the
dreams
of
a
young
girl
presently
the
old
man
rose
shaking
off
his
meditations
and
said
is
time
for
me
to
go
to
the
festival
and
i
shall
have
a
stormy
trudge
of
it
to
the
castle
i
must
leave
you
alone
here
till
night
but
my
child
i
know
that
there
is
safety
for
the
daughter
wherever
she
may
be
the
very
sea
would
not
hurt
her
and
the
wildest
men
would
kneel
before
her
so
farewell
and
a
blessing
be
upon
daughter
rose
and
fetched
his
cloak
and
staff
wrapped
the
former
around
him
and
fastened
it
over
the
rude
musical
instrument
that
answered
the
purpose
of
lyre
and
harp
but
i
am
not
very
learned
in
such
things
and
can
not
tell
you
exactly
what
it
was
the
young
girl
stood
long
on
the
threshold
of
the
hut
shading
the
light
and
looking
out
after
her
father
into
the
darkness
the
wind
was
sharp
and
icy
and
blew
from
the
frozen
sea
as
she
held
the
light
she
thought
she
heard
a
cry
come
from
the
direction
of
the
sea
she
lingered
before
closing
the
door
although
the
wind
was
very
chill
for
the
cry
seemed
repeated
and
she
thought
it
was
a
human
voice
calling
a
reflection
told
her
it
could
not
be
so
for
the
whole
sea
was
frozen
for
miles
outward
and
no
boat
or
wreck
could
come
so
near
land
she
sat
down
again
to
her
work
and
mused
on
the
conversation
she
had
held
with
her
father
he
had
studied
their
national
books
all
his
life
and
she
was
not
yet
twenty
he
must
know
best
was
she
likely
to
be
right
she
had
little
experience
of
the
way
in
which
the
old
system
worked
only
her
own
dreams
and
fancies
showed
her
any
other
possibility
and
yet
she
could
not
shake
off
the
thought
she
thirsted
for
another
revelation
the
unknown
godhead
must
have
some
means
of
communicating
with
men
why
should
he
not
speak
to
her
who
so
passionately
and
blindly
longed
for
a
message
a
command
from
him
cry
from
the
sea
sounded
again
surely
this
time
there
could
be
no
mistake
the
voice
was
human
and
it
had
come
nearer
since
she
had
left
the
door
she
took
up
the
light
again
and
went
outside
shouting
as
loud
as
she
could
in
return
she
was
answered
and
a
strange
awe
came
upon
her
as
she
heard
this
cry
was
it
that
of
a
man
or
a
spirit
the
latter
supposition
seemed
to
her
unsophisticated
mind
quite
as
likely
as
the
former
but
it
did
not
frighten
her
as
it
would
most
of
her
countrywomen
she
went
in
again
wrapped
a
thick
fur
cloak
around
her
and
taking
another
on
her
arm
sallied
out
once
more
with
another
stronger
light
it
was
barely
possible
to
keep
the
resinous
torch
alight
and
she
looked
anxiously
out
towards
the
sea
to
try
and
catch
some
glimpse
of
a
human
figure
the
cries
came
again
at
intervals
but
she
knew
that
in
the
clear
air
a
seemingly
near
sound
might
yet
be
far
distant
she
had
to
walk
briskly
up
and
down
the
shore
in
the
beaten
path
between
walls
of
snow
to
keep
herself
warm
and
occasionally
she
lifted
the
flaring
torch
and
waved
it
as
a
signal
she
could
do
no
more
but
she
longed
to
see
her
unknown
visitor
and
to
go
out
to
meet
him
on
the
frozen
waters
was
it
some
wrecked
sailor
who
had
clambered
from
to
in
the
desperate
hope
of
reaching
land
before
he
died
of
cold
and
hunger
or
some
unearthly
messenger
from
an
invisible
world
if
he
were
a
mere
man
from
what
coast
could
he
have
drifted
no
icelander
would
be
out
at
this
time
and
place
it
was
and
there
were
no
wandering
boats
out
among
the
and
floes
at
last
she
thought
she
could
discern
a
shadowy
form
blacker
than
the
surrounding
darkness
but
surely
no
human
form
it
was
like
a
moving
cross
one
upright
shape
and
one
laid
across
near
the
top
and
both
dark
and
compact
but
the
cry
was
repeated
though
in
a
more
assured
and
joyful
tone
and
the
maiden
waited
with
bated
breath
wondering
what
this
marvel
could
mean
a
field
of
unbroken
ice
stretched
between
her
and
the
advancing
figure
which
now
hastened
its
steps
and
came
on
like
a
bird
cleaving
the
darkness
she
thought
she
could
distinguish
a
human
face
above
the
junction
of
the
two
arms
of
the
cross
and
she
held
up
the
light
still
uncertain
what
kind
of
visitant
this
approaching
form
might
be
at
last
it
flashed
upon
her
that
it
was
a
man
bearing
a
child
but
why
so
rigid
why
did
he
not
hug
him
close
to
his
bosom
to
keep
him
warm
to
keep
him
alive
was
the
child
dead
and
a
shuddering
awe
came
upon
her
as
she
thought
of
its
dead
white
face
upturned
to
heaven
and
of
the
faithful
man
who
had
not
forsaken
it
or
left
it
to
the
seals
and
wolves
on
the
ice
or
buried
it
in
the
chill
waters
beneath
the
what
a
cold
it
must
have
struck
to
the
heart
of
the
man
carrying
it
how
his
hands
must
be
frozen
in
supporting
this
strange
burden
hardly
knew
whether
she
was
still
imagining
what
might
be
or
witnessing
real
movements
when
the
figure
came
straight
up
to
her
and
stooping
laid
the
child
at
her
feet
she
lowered
the
torch
and
as
the
glare
fell
on
the
little
face
she
saw
that
it
was
no
breathing
one
the
man
had
sunk
down
beside
it
hardly
able
to
stir
now
the
supreme
effort
was
over
and
his
end
was
accomplished
she
dropped
the
cloak
she
held
over
the
little
body
and
caught
up
a
handful
of
snow
wherewith
she
energetically
rubbed
the
face
and
hands
of
the
stranger
then
half
dragged
half
supported
him
to
the
door
of
the
hut
he
had
only
spoken
once
just
as
he
dropped
at
her
feet
but
she
did
not
understand
him
he
spoke
in
a
foreign
tongue
once
more
she
went
out
and
brought
in
the
stiffened
frozen
body
of
the
child
which
she
laid
on
a
fur
robe
just
outside
the
hut
for
it
was
warm
within
the
small
confined
dwelling
it
was
an
hour
before
the
eye
told
her
that
her
simple
quick
remedies
had
succeeded
he
was
not
very
tall
but
immensely
strong
and
powerful
and
there
was
a
fire
in
his
dark
gray
eye
that
gave
the
clew
to
his
strange
weird
pilgrimage
over
the
his
hair
was
dark
brown
with
a
reddish
tinge
but
already
mixed
with
a
few
gray
streaks
it
had
been
shorn
close
to
his
head
some
time
since
as
appeared
from
its
irregular
growth
at
present
beneath
his
cloak
he
wore
a
long
black
robe
with
a
leathern
girdle
round
the
waist
the
child
was
very
beautiful
even
in
death
his
eyes
were
closed
but
his
black
curling
hair
hung
round
his
neck
and
the
lips
had
a
sweet
though
somewhat
proud
outline
the
daughter
set
some
simple
food
before
her
silent
guest
and
made
him
a
sign
to
eat
he
was
evidently
very
hungry
but
before
he
began
he
moved
his
lips
and
made
the
sign
of
the
cross
on
his
forehead
lips
and
breast
she
asked
him
in
her
own
language
what
that
ceremony
meant
not
hoping
to
make
him
understand
her
speech
but
trusting
to
her
inquiring
looks
for
some
explanatory
sign
that
she
might
interpret
as
best
she
could
to
herself
to
her
surprise
he
answered
in
a
few
slow
labored
words
not
in
icelandic
to
be
sure
but
in
some
dialect
akin
to
it
for
she
could
make
out
the
meaning
it
was
in
fact
the
norse
dialect
that
was
spoken
in
the
orkney
islands
but
she
did
not
know
that
as
he
spoke
her
guest
pointed
upwards
and
she
knew
that
he
referred
to
god
a
great
longing
came
into
her
heart
and
she
asked
again
if
his
god
were
the
same
the
icelanders
worshipped
he
shook
his
head
and
she
eagerly
questioned
farther
but
grew
so
voluble
that
he
could
not
follow
her
and
the
conversation
ceased
then
the
stranger
rose
and
went
out
to
the
little
corpse
which
he
addressed
in
impassioned
terms
in
his
own
language
making
over
it
the
same
sign
that
had
drawn
the
attention
before
he
then
described
to
her
mostly
in
pantomime
and
with
a
few
norse
words
to
help
him
on
and
a
few
questions
on
her
part
how
the
boy
and
he
had
been
in
a
boat
that
was
wrecked
many
journey
from
their
own
country
and
how
he
had
carried
him
and
fed
him
for
three
or
four
days
and
then
seen
him
die
in
his
arms
the
boy
was
the
only
son
of
a
great
chief
and
he
was
taking
him
to
his
uncle
in
the
north
of
scotland
his
own
country
was
south
of
scotland
a
large
island
like
iceland
but
green
and
beautiful
and
there
was
no
ice
there
girl
made
him
understand
that
she
was
alone
for
a
day
or
two
but
when
her
father
came
back
he
would
help
him
he
evidently
understood
her
better
than
she
did
him
next
morning
when
she
again
set
food
before
him
she
imitated
his
sign
of
the
cross
and
said
she
wished
to
believe
in
the
true
god
and
if
his
god
were
the
true
one
she
would
believe
in
him
she
looked
so
earnest
and
anxious
that
he
again
began
to
try
to
explain
but
the
few
words
he
could
command
though
they
sufficed
to
hint
at
his
worldly
adventures
and
made
clear
to
her
that
he
had
been
wrecked
were
scarcely
adequate
to
tell
her
of
the
new
religion
she
longed
to
understand
at
noon
that
day
another
guest
and
traveller
passed
by
the
dwelling
he
was
hurrying
to
the
same
castle
where
the
father
had
gone
in
his
capacity
of
minstrel
but
a
violent
had
come
on
that
morning
and
he
had
lost
his
way
he
stopped
a
moment
to
refresh
himself
and
noticed
the
stranger
he
was
himself
known
as
a
great
traveller
and
the
figure
in
the
coarse
black
robe
seemed
not
unfamiliar
to
him
he
addressed
the
stranger
in
the
language
guessing
him
at
once
to
be
an
irish
monk
he
said
he
had
seen
such
men
in
the
scottish
islands
where
he
had
been
with
his
ship
two
years
ago
and
he
had
picked
up
a
little
of
their
speech
when
the
maiden
discovered
that
in
this
stray
guest
she
had
found
an
interpreter
she
pressed
him
implored
him
almost
commanded
him
to
stay
must
ask
him
the
questions
my
father
could
not
solve
yesterday
she
said
my
friend
will
not
refuse
to
speak
in
my
name
for
i
believe
that
the
unknown
god
has
answered
my
prayer
in
sending
this
holy
man
over
the
sea
to
my
very
and
she
told
him
how
the
stranger
had
come
to
her
out
of
the
darkness
in
the
shape
of
a
cross
the
same
sign
he
made
to
propitiate
his
god
him
to
tell
us
what
he
believes
she
said
impetuously
and
the
interpreter
compelled
by
some
instinct
that
he
could
not
resist
began
his
office
willingly
him
she
said
yesterday
before
he
came
i
was
all
day
thinking
that
the
high
true
unknown
god
had
a
message
for
me
and
a
truer
faith
to
teach
me
because
he
had
put
into
my
heart
a
longing
for
something
higher
than
what
our
books
and
songs
have
taught
us
and
tell
him
that
i
believe
god
sent
him
in
answer
to
my
doubts
and
traveller
faithfully
translated
all
this
the
face
glowed
as
he
replied
in
his
own
language
which
he
used
with
the
grace
and
skill
of
a
poet
the
maiden
that
she
is
right
the
true
god
send
me
and
now
i
know
why
such
things
happened
to
me
why
i
was
wrecked
with
my
only
son
a
precious
freight
a
sacred
deposit
which
the
lord
of
lords
has
now
taken
upon
himself
to
account
for
to
the
earthly
father
bereaved
of
his
one
hope
but
god
sent
me
here
because
to
this
virgin
i
was
to
explain
the
faith
he
had
already
put
into
her
heart
it
is
not
i
who
bring
her
the
true
faith
but
god
himself
who
has
spoken
to
her
and
inclined
her
to
believe
me
he
has
sent
to
put
this
message
into
practical
form
tell
her
that
this
is
the
birthday
of
the
lord
and
that
a
thousand
years
ago
almost
at
the
same
hour
when
i
set
my
dead
burden
at
her
feet
a
living
child
own
child
lay
at
the
feet
of
a
pure
virgin
in
a
little
village
far
away
in
the
land
of
the
rising
sun
and
as
this
torch
which
i
saw
over
the
wild
frozen
sea
and
followed
was
an
emblem
of
the
faith
that
dwelt
already
in
her
heart
so
too
a
marvellous
star
led
three
wise
men
the
scalds
of
the
east
to
where
this
child
lay
and
the
star
was
the
emblem
of
their
firm
faith
which
led
them
to
cross
rivers
and
deserts
to
reach
the
child
and
tell
her
that
the
way
in
which
this
wonderful
birth
was
celebrated
was
by
a
song
which
held
all
the
essence
of
truth
in
it
to
god
on
high
and
on
earth
peace
to
men
of
this
the
interpreter
told
the
maiden
and
both
marvelled
at
it
the
stranger
told
them
more
and
more
of
that
wonderful
tale
so
familiar
to
us
but
which
once
sounded
to
our
warlike
forefathers
like
the
foolishness
of
babes
and
sucklings
or
at
most
like
some
eastern
myth
good
enough
for
philosophers
to
wrangle
over
but
unfit
for
sturdy
men
of
the
forest
to
the
icelandic
maiden
it
seemed
but
the
fulfilment
of
her
own
dreams
and
as
she
listened
to
the
story
of
the
child
grown
to
be
a
wise
but
obedient
boy
and
then
a
wandering
suffering
man
her
soul
seemed
to
drink
in
the
hidden
grandeur
of
the
relation
to
pierce
beyond
the
human
which
confronted
the
wise
and
learned
of
other
lands
and
go
at
once
to
the
heart
of
the
great
mystery
of
love
personified
in
the
all
the
rest
seemed
to
her
to
be
the
fitting
garment
of
the
central
mystery
the
crown
of
leaves
growing
from
the
fruitful
trunk
of
this
one
doctrine
all
day
long
the
three
sat
together
the
two
icelanders
hanging
on
the
words
of
the
stranger
and
so
the
scald
found
them
on
his
return
he
too
wanted
to
know
the
news
which
the
monk
had
brought
for
he
said
he
had
always
believed
that
behind
their
national
songs
and
hymns
lay
something
greater
but
perhaps
not
expedient
for
norsemen
to
know
he
shook
his
head
sadly
when
he
learned
the
precepts
of
love
peace
mercy
and
forgiveness
and
said
he
feared
his
countrymen
would
not
understand
that
but
for
his
part
it
was
not
uncongenial
to
him
as
the
weather
was
such
that
no
vessel
could
put
to
sea
before
the
ice
broke
up
he
constrained
the
monk
to
stay
the
rest
of
the
winter
with
him
and
in
the
spring
promised
to
go
over
with
him
to
the
nearest
scottish
coast
and
carry
the
body
of
his
little
charge
to
the
uncle
to
whom
he
had
been
on
his
way
when
he
was
wrecked
the
new
year
began
the
monk
baptized
the
first
icelandic
convert
the
daughter
of
the
scald
and
gave
her
the
name
of
the
mother
of
the
babe
of
bethlehem
mary
many
others
heard
of
the
new
religion
before
he
left
but
that
does
not
belong
to
my
story
the
new
convert
and
her
father
accompanied
him
to
scotland
and
were
present
at
the
burial
of
the
irish
son
at
the
castle
of
his
scottish
uncle
the
son
married
the
norse
maiden
but
she
never
ceased
to
lament
that
it
had
not
been
given
to
her
to
convert
many
of
her
own
countrymen
or
at
least
shed
her
blood
for
her
new
faith
all
her
life
long
she
helped
to
send
missionaries
to
iceland
and
when
her
son
grew
up
to
manhood
the
palm
she
coveted
was
awarded
to
him
for
he
went
to
his
native
country
founded
a
monastery
there
labored
among
the
people
converted
many
and
taught
reading
and
the
arts
of
peace
as
well
as
the
faith
to
his
pupils
became
abbot
of
the
monastery
and
was
finally
martyred
on
the
steps
of
the
altar
by
a
horde
of
savage
heathen
norsemen
is
the
best
christmas
story
i
know
children
concluded
the
herr
pfarrer
you
rika
i
can
wish
you
no
better
model
than
the
fair
maiden
of
it
was
nearly
midnight
when
the
old
priest
finished
his
tale
and
frau
köhler
rising
and
thanking
him
cordially
for
this
unwonted
addition
to
ordinary
christmas
stories
led
him
to
a
door
which
had
been
locked
till
now
it
opened
into
a
room
decked
as
a
chapel
with
an
altar
at
the
end
which
was
now
decorated
with
evergreens
a
few
chairs
and
benches
were
ranged
before
it
and
on
a
table
at
the
side
was
everything
in
readiness
for
saying
mass
is
long
since
i
have
heard
a
midnight
mass
said
the
good
hostess
growing
suddenly
grave
and
reverential
in
her
manner
my
rika
never
has
and
you
know
herr
pfarrer
i
told
you
i
had
a
greater
surprise
in
store
for
you
yet
after
all
the
local
customs
in
which
you
were
so
much
so
the
beautiful
midnight
mass
was
said
in
the
mecklenburg
and
a
more
impressive
one
frau
köhler
had
never
heard
in
any
southern
cathedral
for
though
there
was
no
music
and
no
pomp
there
brooded
over
the
little
congregation
a
spirit
of
reverence
and
peace
which
comes
in
full
perfection
only
through
a
deep
silence
the
hostess
and
her
daughter
received
communion
together
and
the
attentive
household
could
not
help
thinking
of
the
beautiful
icelandic
convert
when
she
came
back
from
the
altar
her
hands
folded
over
her
breast
and
her
long
fair
hair
plaited
in
two
plain
thick
tresses
herr
heldmann
had
stayed
too
and
from
that
day
he
never
ceased
his
study
of
theological
problems
and
his
correspondence
with
the
herr
pfarrer
till
he
became
a
catholic
and
was
married
to
rika
in
this
same
little
a
year
later
by
the
same
kind
old
priest
one
of
the
young
apprentices
of
emanuel
köhler
had
been
his
secret
rival
but
notwithstanding
that
heldmann
was
ungainly
shy
and
twice
her
age
rika
decidedly
thought
that
she
had
the
best
of
the
bargain
and
it
was
true
he
had
a
heart
of
gold
and
she
made

under

title

catholicism

union
of
the
christian
episcopal
an
essay
has
recently
been
published
by
the
rev
father
tondini
barnabite
whose
intimate
acquaintance
with
the
respective
languages
of
england
germany
and
russia
as
well
as
the
religious
history
and
literature
of
those
countries
peculiarly
qualifies
him
for
dealing
with
the
questions
just
now
exciting
so
much
attention
in
western
europe
we
shall
therefore
not
only
make
his
treatise
which
merits
more
than
ordinary
notice
the
basis
of
the
present
article
but
shall
reproduce
such
portions
of
it
as
are
particularly
suggestive
at
the
present
time
and
conclude
with
some
account
of
the
conference
at
bonn
and
the
considerations
it
suggests
in
the
introduction
to
his
treatise
the
reverend
author
gives
the
reasons
which
called
it
forth
the
last
being
the
promise
made
on
the
tomb
of
a
friend
to
leave
nothing
untried
which
might
promote
the
return
of
the
church
to
catholic
unity
an
unexpected
opportunity
being
given
for
fulfilling
this
promise
by
the
reference
made
more
than
once
by
gladstone
in
his
recent
publications
to
the
organization
of
the
eastern
as
contrasted
with
that
of
the
catholic
church
moreover
the
sympathy
displayed
by
gladstone
for
the
old
catholics
and
their
conference
at
bonn
serves
to
complete
the
argument
there
are
two
passages
in
with
which
father
tondini
has
more
especially
dealt
one
is
the
following
these
early
provisions
for
a
balance
of
church
power
and
for
securing
the
laity
against
sacerdotal
domination
the
rigid
conservatism
of
the
eastern
church
presents
us
even
down
to
the
present
day
with
an
authentic
and
living
these
valuable
are
set
forth
at
length
in
the
second
edition
of
a
former
work
by
father
tondini
pope
of
rome
and
the
popes
of
the
oriental
in
a
special
preface
he
there
says
is
much
to
be
learned
from
them
especially
if
we
take
into
consideration
their
recent
date
and
the
ecclesiastical
canons
of
which
the
eastern
church
has
not
been
indeed
a
rigid
in
the
quotations
there
given
at
length
from
the
original
documents
we
find
abundant
evidence
of
the
manner
in
which
the
ancient
canons
have
been
set
aside
wherever
convenient
to
the
czar
for
his
own
regulations
the
second
passage
requiring
comment
is
the
following
ancient
principles
of
popular
election
and
control
for
which
room
was
found
in
the
apostolic
church
under
its
inspired
teachers
and
which
still
subsist
in
the
christian
this
as
we
shall
see
is
disposed
of
in
the
third
chapter
of
the
present
essay
into
which
has
been
collected
trustworthy
information
as
to
the
mode
of
election
of
bishops
resorted
to
in
the
oriental
orthodox
church
towards
the
close
of
the
introduction
the
writer
remarks
that
if
the
statements
made
by
gladstone
respecting
the
catholic
church
were
true
she
could
not
be
the
true
church
of
our
lord
and
if
not
he
asks
where
then
is
the
true
church
to
be
found
the
oriental
church
could
not
solve
the
question
because
she
is
in
contradiction
to
the
doctrine
contained
in
her
own
liturgy
and
also
for
other
reasons
to
which
for
some
years
past
he
has
been
directing
public
attention
there
remain
to
be
considered
the
anglican
establishment
this
being
the
church
to
which
belongs
the
writer
who
accuses
the
catholic
church
of
having
changed
in
faith
and
deprived
her
children
of
their
moral
and
mental
freedom
and
the
newest
sect
of
all
namely
the
old
catholics
owing
to
the
same
admiration
of
those
who
figure
in
its
ranks
reason
so
loudly
appealed
to
by
gladstone
has
been
strictly
adhered
to
by
father
tondini
in
his
careful
examination
of
the
credentials
of
the
two
latter
bodies
and
we
will
give
in
as
concise
a
form
as
may
be
consistent
with
clearness
the
result
of
his
inquiry
he
especially
addresses
those
who
admit
the
existence
of
a
visible
church
of
christ
and
still
more
particularly
those
who
rather
than
reconcile
themselves
to
the
catholic
church
say
that
neither
the
roman
catholic
church
nor
the
anglican
establishment
nor
the
society
but
the
oriental
orthodox
church
is
the
true
visible
church
of
christ
i
the
claims
of
the
anglican
church
are
first
examined
her
vitality
being
an
argument
that
we
are
in
presence
of
an
institution
adhered
to
at
least
by
a
large
portion
of
her
members
with
conviction
and
devotedness
as
a
valuable
medium
between
unbelief
and
superstition
worldliness
and
sanctity
and
of
a
state
church
as
solidly
framed
as
human
genius
could
devise
says
gladstone
usually
held
to
be
bound
by
the
evidence
of
their
own
selected
and
typical
now
the
selected
and
typical
witnesses
of
the
church
of
england
are
the
sovereign
who
is
of
the
faith
and
supreme
governor
of
the
church
in
her
dominions
and
the
episcopate
if
the
whole
clergy
is
consulted
the
evidence
becomes
as
undeniable
as
it
can
possibly
be
this
perfect
evidence
is
found
in
the
articles
which
are
thus
headed
agreed
upon
by
the
archbishops
and
bishops
of
both
provinces
and
the
whole
clergy
assembled
in
convocation
holden
at
london
in
the
year
for
the
avoiding
of
diversities
of
opinions
etc
the
ratification
is
to
the
same
effect
with
the
addition
of
the
assent
and
consent
of
the
queen
elizabeth
after
their
final
rehearsal
in
the
general
convocation
of
bishops
and
clergy
in
they
are
moreover
reprinted
in
the
of
common
with
the
declaration
of
king
james
affixed
and
which
runs
as
follows
by
ordinance
according
to
our
just
title
defender
of
the
faith
and
supreme
governor
of
the
church
in
these
our
dominions
we
will
that
all
curious
search
be
laid
aside
and
these
disputes
shut
up
in
promises
as
they
be
generally
set
forth
in
the
holy
scriptures
and
the
general
meaning
of
the
articles
of
the
church
of
england
according
to
them
and
that
no
man
hereafter
shall
either
print
or
preach
to
draw
the
article
aside
any
way
but
shall
submit
to
it
in
the
plain
and
full
meaning
thereof
and
shall
take
it
in
the
literal
and
grammatical
this
last
admonition
and
bearing
in
mind
that
the
church
of
england
considers
herself
to
be
a
branch
of
the
universal
church
of
christ
we
open
the
of
common
and
turn
to
those
among
the
articles
which
treat
of
the
universal
church
that
we
may
see
how
without
renouncing
our
italian
nationality
which
to
us
is
very
dear
we
could
belong
to
the
universal
church
of
christ
we
see
an
article
headed
the
authority
of
general
councils
and
on
reading
it
find
to
our
astonishment
the
definition
not
indeed
of
the
infallibility
of
the
pope
but
of
the
fallibility
without
any
exception
of
the
universal
church
of
christ
it
is
article
councils
may
not
be
called
together
without
the
commandment
and
will
of
princes
and
when
they
be
gathered
together
forasmuch
as
they
be
an
assembly
of
men
whereof
all
be
not
governed
with
the
spirit
and
word
of
god
they
may
err
and
sometimes
have
erred
even
in
things
pertaining
unto
god
wherefore
things
ordained
by
them
as
necessary
to
salvation
have
neither
strength
nor
authority
unless
it
may
be
declared
that
they
be
taken
out
of
holy
we
give
father
words
church
of
england
has
defined
in
two
plenary
national
councils
that
the
universal
church
of
christ
even
when
assembled
in
a
general
council
may
err
and
ordain
as
necessary
to
salvation
things
which
have
neither
strength
nor
authority
and
a
king
of
the
faith
has
declared
that
this
is
the
true
doctrine
of
the
church
of
england
agreeable
to
word
and
required
all
his
loving
subjects
to
submit
to
this
article
the
plain
and
full
meaning
thereof
and
to
take
it
the
literal
and
grammatical
can
hardly
trust
our
own
eyes
again
what
does
the
word
mean
in
the
concluding
words
of
the
article
this
word
may
convey
two
senses
that
of
proving
and
of
making
a
declaration
the
first
case
is
to
offer
the
proofs
that
thing
ordained
as
necessary
to
is
taken
out
of
holy
scripture
this
the
church
of
england
has
forgotten
to
tell
us
moreover
an
authority
whose
decrees
in
order
to
have
a
binding
power
must
be
proved
to
be
taken
out
of
holy
scripture
is
by
that
very
fact
subordinate
to
those
who
are
called
to
examine
the
proofs
the
chief
authorities
of
the
church
assembled
in
a
general
council
are
thus
rendered
as
inferior
to
the
faithful
as
the
claimant
is
inferior
to
the
judge
who
is
about
to
pronounce
sentence
upon
his
claims
the
teaching
and
governing
body
of
the
church
is
consequently
no
more
than
an
assembly
commissioned
to
frame
necessary
to
salvation
laws
to
be
submitted
to
the
approbation
of
the
faithful
this
serious
is
it
even
respectful
to
human
intelligence
again
if
the
word
must
be
taken
in
the
sense
of
a
declaration
father
tondini
asks
by
whom
is
such
a
declaration
to
be
made
assuredly
not
by
the
council
itself

authority
liable
to
err
in
things
pertaining
unto
god
and
to
ordain
necessary
to
things
which
have
strength
nor
authority
is
liable
also
to
mistake
the
sense
of
holy
scripture
to
seek
such
a
declaration
from
this
fallible
authority
would
be
like
begging
the
question
declaration
must
then
be
made
by
some
authority
external
to
the
general
council
but
the
bishops
and
the
whole
clergy
of
have
omitted
to
inform
the
faithful
such
an
authority
is
to
be
found
moreover
since
a
general
council
that
is
the
and
typical
of
the
whole
church
of
christ
may
err
according
to
article
xxi
it
necessarily
follows
that
portions
of
the
whole
church
of
christ
may
err
also
in
fact
this
natural
consequence
is
explicitly
stated
in
article
xix
the
zeal
displayed
by
the
church
of
england
in
asserting
the
fallibility
both
of
the
whole
church
of
christ
and
of
portions
of
that
church
may
be
said
to
rival
that
of
the
most
fervent
advocates
of
the
infallibility
of
the
this
xixth
article
modestly
asserts
that
the
churches
of
jerusalem
alexandria
and
antioch
have
erred
so
also
the
church
of
rome
hath
erred
not
only
in
their
living
and
manner
of
ceremonies
but
also
in
matters
of
whereupon
legitimate
doubt
arises
whether
the
church
of
england
too
might
not
have
erred
in
issuing
the
articles
of
religion
this
doubt
is
very
material
these
articles
ordain
several
things
as
to
are
they
or
are
they
not
out
of
holy
have
they
or
have
they
not
and
shortly
after
their
promulgation
we
have
it
upon
the
authority
of
king
james
himself
that
this
doubt
gave
rise
to
altercations
and
questions
such
as
may
nourish
faction
both
in
the
church
and
commonwealth
and
his
majesty
adds
that
upon
mature
deliberation
he
to
make
the
declaration
following
the
articles
of
the
church
of
england
do
contain
the
true
doctrine
of
the
church
of
england
agreeable
to
word
which
we
do
therefore
ratify
and
with
father
tondini
allowed
respectfully
to
ask
whether
king
james
was
infallible
and
if
so
why
should
catholics
be
charged
with
having
forfeited
their
mental
and
moral
freedom
because
they
admit
the
infallibility
of
the
pope
which
results
by
the
law
of
development
from
several
passages
of
holy
scripture
whereas
on
the
contrary
no
will
ever
be
able
to
discover
a
single
word
in
holy
scripture
which
can
by
the
most
vigorous
process
of
development
bud
forth
into
the
infallibility
of
a
king
of
england
on
the
other
hand
if
king
james
were
infallible
by
what
right
could
he
then
prohibit
and
in
matters
of
faith
for
his
subjects
his
only
right
was
this
that
the
church
of
england
had
been
made
a
powerful
in
the
hands
of
her
sovereigns
just
as
the
church
of
russia
is
in
the
hands
of
her
czars
after
this
observes
the
writer
no
inconsistency
ought
to
astonish
us
in
article
xviii
it
is
declared
that
body
of
christ
is
given
taken
and
eaten
in
the
supper
after
an
heavenly
and
spiritual
and
again
at
the
end
of
the
of
the
ministration
of
the
holy
communion
that
natural
body
and
blood
of
our
saviour
christ
are
in
heaven
not
how
can
these
declarations
be
made
to
agree
with
the
following
which
is
taught
in
the
little
catechism
body
and
blood
of
christ
are
and
indeed
and
received
by
the
faithful
in
the

in
article
xi

find
we
are

a
most
wholesome
doctrine
and
very
full
of
whereas
in
the
order
for
the
visitation
of
the
sick

read
as
follows
shall
the
sick
person
be
moved
to
make
special
confession
of
his
if
he
feel
his
conscience
troubled
with
any
weighty
matter
after
which
confession
the
priest
shall
absolve
him
if
he
humbly
and
heartily
desire
it
after
this
sort
etc
asks
father
tondini
what
strange
metamorphosis
can
the
doctrine
of
justification

declared
to
be
wholesome
and
very
full
of
while
we
are
in
good
health
cease
to
possess
the
power
of
comforting
the
conscience
of
a
sick
person
and
how
can
confession
which
through
life
is
to
be
considered
by
anglicans
as
of
the
corrupt
following
of
the
see
article
xxv
become
suddenly
so
transfigured
by
the
approach
of
death
as
to
obtain
the
power
of
relieving
a
conscience
with
any
weighty
although
it
may
not
be
matter
of
much
surprise
that
a
church
which
has
so
carefully
defined
her
own
fallibility
should
have
one
doctrine
for
her
children
in
their
days
of
health
and
vigor
and
another
for
the
time
of
their
sickness
and
death
still
it
does
surprise
us
that
a
man
of
education
like
gladstone
should
be
so
unconscious
of
his
own
extraordinary
inconsistency
in
appealing
as
he
does
throughout
his
attacks
against
catholics
and
the
catholic
church
to
and
moral
freedom
of
mind
of
thought
etc
already
arise
from
all
sides

of
the

enough

condition
for
holding
anglican
preferment
until
the

half
of

adopted
as
a
weapon
against
the
growing
power
of
the
dissenters
anglicans
who
had
always
argued
as
protestants
against

to

the
english
episcopate
seems
veering
round
again
to
the
protestant
quarter
against
the
innovations
of
a
portion
of
the
clergy
the
which
up
to
the
time
when
it
ceased
to
exist
a
few
weeks
ago
had
been
protesting
for
many
months
previously
with
good
reason
against

implacable
opposition

bishops

told
its
readers
while
asserting
once
more
that
one
trusts
the
bishops
and
that
influence
they
have
and
can
have
next
to
none
nevertheless
that
claims
as
catholic
bishops
were
never
so
firmly
certainly
anglican
logic
is
peculiar
their
bishops
were
never
more
vehemently
opposed
to
the
catholic
faith
but
no
matter
were
they
more
truly

very
reluctantly
says
lee
as
reported
in

to
a
conclusion
which
makes
me
melancholy
that
the
passing
of
the
public
worship
bill
has
to
all
intents
and
purposes
sealed
the
fate
of
the
church
of
its
end
he
thinks
is
very
near
because
no
church
can
last
unless
it
be
a
true
portion
of
the
one
family
of
god
not
a
mere
human
sect
taking
its
variable
opinion
from
the
civil
government
and
its
practice
from
a
parliamentary
officer
without
the
faintest
shadow
of
spiritual
authority
point
that
gravely
perplexes
me
he
writes
regard
to
the
new
law
is
that
our
bishops
one
and
all
have
with
their
eyes
open
and
deliberately
renounced
their
spiritual
jurisdiction
which
for
both
provinces
and
every
diocese
is
placed
in
the
hands
of
lord
penzance
of
the
divorce
for
which
reason
certain
ritualist
papers
lament
it
as
and
that
lee
should
say
of
the
bishops
and
their
bill
exactly
the
same
their
victory
as
they
themselves
had
said
it
these
papers
after
the
example
of
some
learned
anglican
professors
are
ready
enough
beforehand
to
threaten
in
the
event
of
such
and
such
a
decision
to
their
the
decision
is
made
they
then
discover
that
after
all
it
is
not
so
very
serious
and
compose
themselves
for
the
third
or
fourth
or
fifth

just
where
they
were
before

stated
that

not

more
disastrous
than
a
triumph
now
and
the
rest
of
the
episcopal
bench
are
evidently
of
the
same
mind
nor
can
it
be
matter
of
much
surprise
that
such
repression
should
be
exercised
against
men
many
of
them
truly
earnest
and
who
are
the
means
of
reviving
a
certain
amount
of
catholic
doctrine
as
well
as

however
illegal

write

correspondent

in
the

of

suffragans
frankly
declared
that
he
nor
they
and
his
grace
to
give
him
all
credit
has
done
his
worst
to
get
rid
of
here
again
can
we
wonder
at
the
result
even
to
her
highest
dignitaries
of
the
uncertain
teaching
of
a
church
which
from
its
very
beginning
was
intended
to
be
a
compromise
and
again
how
can
a
church
which
is
essentially
a
compromise
be
expected
to
sympathize
with
that
unchanging
church
which
is
pillar
and
ground
of
the

return
to

essay
we
come
now
to
consider
the
newest
among
the
sects

old
catholics
who
after
the
manner
of
many
other
schismatics
appropriate
the
name
of
with
an
affix
of
their
own
which
is
a
proof
that
theirs
is
a
base
metal
unworthy

the

champion
of
his
church
refused
compliance
and
submitted
with
his
temper
undisturbed
and
his
freedom
unimpaired
to
the
extreme
and
most
painful
penalty
of
excommunication
with
him
many
of
the
most
learned
and
respected
theologians
of
the
roman
communion
in
germany
underwent
the

sentence
the
very
few
who

an
admiration
rising
in

as

the
mighty
trumpet
that
even

echoes
through

still
retained
her
primacy

of
the
after
giving
this
quotation
father
tondini
in
the
exercise
of
his
freedom
proceeds
to
examine
whether
old
catholics
really
deserve
this
highly
laudatory
and
enthusiastic
passage
and
in
what
their
merit
consists
their
merit
consists
having
rebelled
against
the
church
to
which
they
previously
belonged
on
the
ground
that
in
their
conviction
she
had
changed
her
faith
one
single
bishop
not
one
out
of
the
teaching
body
of
the
church
has
expressed
the
same
conviction
old
catholics
are
then
a
mere
handful
protesting
against
the
pope
and
the
whole
episcopate
preferring
their
own
private
judgment
to
that
of
the
whole
teaching
body
of
the
catholic
church
and
fully
decided
to
do
everything
in
their
power
to
bring
about
the
triumph
of
their
private
personal
judgment
their
first
act
was
to
raise
a
schism
in
the
church
they
had
openly
and
freely
separated
themselves
from
her
long
before
the
sentence
of
excommunication
was
notified
to
them
they
then
became
the
occasion
of
a
severe
persecution
against
their
former
and
now
whilst
the
persecution
is
raging
and
old
catholics
supported
by
governments
and
the
press
have
suffered
neither
in
person
nor
property
nor
in
their
individual
liberty
we
are
called
upon
to
bestow
upon
those
who
suffered
like
an
admiration
rising
in
proportion
to
their
fewness
but
why
is
this
and
what
is
the
itself
but
a
cry
of
alarm
to
prevent
british
catholics
from
rebelling
against
the
queen
why
then
is
the
rebellion
of
some
private
individuals
to
be
extolled
in
terms
like
these
or
if
indeed
strong
private
religious
convictions
taking
it
for
granted
that
the
old
catholics
have
such
make
it
praiseworthy
to
rebel
against
the
church
why
should
not
strong
private
political
convictions
make
it
equally
praiseworthy
to
rebel
against
the
state
the
field
of
similar
applications
is
fearfully
wide
and
many
a
parental
admonition
to
an
indolent
or
disobedient
child
might
be
met
by
the
young
rebel
in
words

temper
undisturbed
with
freedom
unimpaired
he
had
no
intention
to
do
as
he
was

the
first
official
document
of
the
old
catholics
is

with
a
request
that
every
reader
will
help
to
make
it
known
and
gain
as
many
additional
adherents
as
possible
the
style
of
both
documents
is
peculiar
they
alike
belong
to
those
literary
productions
which
betray
an
almost
feverish
excitement
of
mind
a
small
number
of
persons
till
lately
belonging
to
the
catholic
church
declare
themselves
to
do
their
utmost
towards
bringing
about
reform
of
ecclesiastical
affairs
so
long
desired
and
henceforth
so
inevitable
in
the
organization
as
well
as
in
the
life
of
the
in
fact
the
authors
of
both
these
documents
show
a
faith
in
their
own
infallibility
both
doctrinal
and
practical
at
least
as
strong
as
their
conviction
of
the
fallibility
of
the
pope
they
are
peculiarly
unfortunate
in
their
choice
of
the
fathers
they
quote
as
well
as
in
their
appeal
to
the
authority
of
paul
their
style
is
certainly
wholly
unlike
that
of
this
great
apostle
who
with
so
much
earnestness
and
humility
begs
the
prayers
of
the
faithful
while
the
necessity
of
prayer
for
such
an
undertaking
as
that
which
the
old
catholics
call
the
of
the
is
not
even
once
alluded
to
in
their
manifestoes
there
is
another
consideration
which
presents
itself
every
practical
man
is
careful
to
ascertain
the
competency
in
any
particular
subject
of
those
who
give
him
their
advice
upon
it
a
sick
man
would
not
consult
a
lawyer
for
his
cure
nor
an
aggrieved
man
seek
legal
advice
of
his
baker
or
shoemaker
the
distinguished
magistrates
who
signed
the
german
declaration
must
be
supposed
to
have
done
so
not
in
consequence
of
a
clear
and
detailed
knowledge
of
the
grounds
of
the
assertions
it
contained
but
in
consequence
of
their
confidence
in
von
döllinger
which
led
them
to
adopt
his
views
in
the
same
way
must
be
explained
the
adhesions
given
by
the
respectable
manufacturers
royal
des
cérémonies
and
royal
de
musique
au
théâtre
de
for
though
these
pursuits
need
not
be
in
themselves
an
obstacle
to
a

being
well
acquainted
with
religious

still
they
are
an
undeniable
argument
against

it

object
of
his
studies
continues
father
tondini
charges
brought
in
the
present
case
against
the
catholic
church
are
so
heavy
and
the
mere
probability
of
their
being
founded
on
truth
of
such
vital
importance
to
the
whole
christian
world
that
to
require
something
more
than
the
ordinary
amount
of
theological
science
which
is
in
general
to
be
found
in
men
involved
in
worldly
affairs
of
the
most
distracting
kind
is
only
acting
in
accordance
with
the
most
ordinary
laws
of
prudence
all
this
will
become
evident
if
we
only
suppose
that
the
had
appeared
without
the
signatures
of
von
döllinger
and
the
in
looking
over
the
latter
we
find
that
none
of
them
can
lay
any
claim
to
the
same
scientific
authority
and
repute
as
that
which
he
enjoys
and
the
same
remark
applies
to
all
who
have
subsequently
joined
the
old
catholics
with
regard
to
von

himself
he
has

we
should
be
grateful
to
any
one
who
might
tell
us
to
what
church
he
belongs
and
whom
he
recognizes
as
his
legitimate
bishop
we
can
not
suppose
that
he
whom

and

the
pretension
of
forming
a

next
notices
the
remarkable
phenomenon
presented
by
old
catholicism
during
the
first
three
years
of
its
existence
as
body
without
a
head
and
calls
the
attention
to
the
following
passage
in
the
french
manifesto
it

the
will
of
god
thus
it
runs
some
roman
bishops

the
courage
to
return
publicly
to
the
profession
of
the
ancient
faith
we
will
place
them
with
joy
at
our
head
and
if
none
break
publicly
with
heresy
our
church
though
essentially
episcopal
will
not
for
that
reason
be
condemned
to
die
for
as
soon
as
it
shall
be
possible
to
regularize
its
situation
in
this
respect
we
shall
choose
priests
who
will
receive
either
in
the
west
or
in
the
east
an
episcopal
consecration
of
unquestionable
he
remarks
plain
words
it
evidently
results
from
them
that
there
was
a
time
when
the
church
by
any
roman
innovation
was
still
looking
for
a
bishop
in
other
words
for
a
head
which
she
did
not
possess
as
yet
how
in
spite
of
this
deficiency
the
church
could
be
termed
essentially
episcopal
we
are
at
a
loss
to
understand
that
which
is
essential
to
a
thing
is
that
without
which
it
can
not
possibly
exist
for
a
single
moment
but
here
we
are
asked
to
believe
in
a
miracle
which
at
once
destroys
all
our
physical
and
metaphysical
notions
of
things
a
warrior
fighting
without
a
head
and
a
being
existing
without
one
of
its
essential
constituents
such
are
the
wonders
which
accompanied
the
genesis
of
the
regenerated
church
of
the
old
the
german
declaration
in
like
manner
states
the
then
headless
condition
of
the
body
its
subscribers
and
among
them
reinkens
say
they
look
forward
to
a
time
when
catholicity
shall
be
placed
under
the
direction
of
a
primate
and
an
episcopacy
which
by
means
of
science
not
by
the
decrees
of
the
vatican
shall
approach
the
crowning
object
assigned
to
christian
development
we
mean
that
of
the
union
of
the
other
christian
confessions
now
separated
from
us

such
was
their
language
in
june
when
they
were
already
nearly
a
year
old
their
first
bishop
joseph
hubert
reinkens
was
consecrated
in
august
these
dates
are
very
important
no
power
on
earth
will
ever
be
able
to
annul
them
as
historical
facts
which
prove
that
a
body
calling
itself
the
true
church
of
christ
has
existed
some
time
without
a
single
bishop
although
bishops
are
essential
to
the
church
of

as

is
not

can
not
be
accounted
a

who
in
despite
of
the

has
of
himself
become

we
now
come
to
the
consideration
of

catholicism
as
an
instrument
of
union
between
the
christian
episcopal
churches
in
accordance
with
their
the
old
catholics
insist
upon
its
being
one
of
their
main
objects
to
reunite
the
christian
churches
separated
from
rome
during
the
viiith
and
ixth
centuries
and
complacently
boast
of
the
marks
of
sympathy
bestowed
upon
them
by
these
churches
from
one
of
their
manifestoes
father
tondini
quotes
the
following
important
statements
bishops
of
the
oriental
orthodox
thus
runs
the
manifesto
those
of
the
episcopal
church
of
england
and
the
united
states
of
america
encourage
old
catholicism
with
their
most
profound
sympathy
representatives
of
the
orthodox
church
of
russia
assist
every
year
at
its
the
interest
displayed
for
it
by
governments
is
not
inferior
to
that
of
the
the
governments
of
russia
and
of
england
are
disposed
to
recognize
its
rights
when
it
shall
be
opportune
to
do
upon
which
he
points
out
the
exceeding
inexpediency
for
their
own
sakes
of
these
governments
or
their
bishops
having
any
participation
in
the
doings
of
old
catholics
and
this
for
the
following
reasons
which
are
worthy
of
careful
consideration
by
the
two
governments
in
question
and
which
we
give
in
his
own
words
order
it
would
seem
to
escape
the
stringent
conclusion
of
words
who
does
not
succeed
to
other
bishops
but
is
can
not
be
reckoned
among
bishops
mgr
reinkens
in
his
pastoral
letter
authoritatively
declared
not
only
that
the
see
of
rome
was
vacant
but
that
not
one
of
the
actually
existing
roman
catholic
bishops
was
legitimate
support
of
this
assumption
the
bishop
invokes
some
fathers
of
the
church
not
indeed
what
they
said
or
did
while
living
but
what
they
would
say
or
do
if
they
were
to
return
to
life
the
great
bishops
of
the
ancient
church
were
to
return
to
life
in
the
midst
of
us
says
mgr
reinkens
cyprian
a
hilary
an
ambrose
they
would
acknowledge
none
of
the
existing
bishops
of
the
roman
catholic
church
as
validly
much
for
the
fact
as
it
can
only
be
ascertained
when
those
great
bishops
are
restored
to
life
all
we
can
do
is
to
defer
this
verification
until
the
great
day
of
judgment
comes
the
general
principle
on
which
the
assumed
fact
is
founded
let
us
listen
again
to
mgr
reinkens
the
resuscitated
bishops
of
the
ancient
church
would
not
acknowledge
any
of
the
existing
bishops
of
the
roman
catholic
church
as
validly
elected
because
none
of
them
were
appointed
in
conformity
with
the
immutable
rule
of
the
fathers
of
the
church
never
no
never
would
they
have
received
into
their
company
in
the
quality
of
a
catholic
bishop
one
who
had
not
been
chosen
by
the
people
and
the
clergy
this
mode
of
election
was
considered
by
them
as
of
divine
precept
and
consequently
as
many
bishops
are
there
in
existence
at
the
present
day
asks
father
tondini
in
the
anglican
church
or
in
the
christian
east
who
have
been
chosen
by
the
people
and
the
clergy
in
answer
to
this
question
we
have
respecting
the
mode
of
election
in
the
oriental
orthodox
church
the
following
trustworthy
information
in
the
orthodox
church
of
the
turkish
empire
the
election
of
a
patriarch
is
made
by
the
members
of
its
synod
which
is
composed
of
metropolitans
of
one
of
their
own
number
and
this
election
then
made
known
to
the
people
assembled
in
the
atrium
of
the
synodicon
who
give
by
acclamation
and
the
cry
of
ἄξιος
worthy
their
assent
to
the
this
however
is
in
fact
an
empty
formality
the
more
so
as
the
election
itself
is
the
result
of
previous
secret
understandings
between
the
more
influential
members
of
the
synod
and
the
leading
men
among
the
three
patriarchs
of
alexandria
antioch
and
jerusalem
are
elected
by
their
respective
synods

of
metropolitans

all

who
have
not
been

by

that
their

are
all

that
this
mode
of

is
of
divine
precept
and
consequently
immutable
know
not
says
father
tondini
of
the
two
is
more
to
be
wondered
at
the
boldness
of
the
old
catholics
in
inviting
the
patriarch
to
be
represented
at
the
congress
or
the
logical
inconsistency
of
the
patriarch
in
accepting
the
next

no

who

of

recently
appeared
in

pages
of

need
to
be
told
how
little
voice

license
to
proceed

always
to

accompanied
with

missive
from

he
would
have
them
elect

delay
their
election
above
twelve

the

shall
devolve
to
the

appoint
such

the

and
imprisonment
during

it
is
to
be
observed
however
that
the
mode
here
described
of
appointing
bishops
applies
only
to
such
sees
as
are
of
old
foundation
the
five
new
bishoprics
created
by
henry
viii
have
always
been
donatives
and
conferred
by
from
the
crown
and
the
case
is
the
same
as
to
the
bishopric
of
ripon
now
recently
on
the
laws
of
vol
iii
in
concluding
his
essay
father
tondini
repeats
mgr
words
the
great
bishops
of
the
ancient
church
were
to
return
to
life
in
the
midst
of
us
never
no
never
would
they
have
received

their
company
in
the
quality
of
a
christian
bishop
one
who
had
not
been
chosen
by
the
people
and
the
clergy
this
mode
of
election
was
considered
by
them
as
of
divine
precept
and
consequently
as
and
then
asks
can
the
support
given
by
the
state
churches
and
governments
of
england
and
russia
to
old
catholicism
be
explained
is
it
for
the
purpose
of
declaring
that
all
the
episcopal
sees
both
of
england
and
russia
are
vacant
and
awaiting
the
choice
of
the
people
the
reader
being
now
acquainted
with
much
of
the
contents
as
well
as
with
the
general
tenor
of
father
essay
may
find
some
interest
possibly
amusement
also
in
comparing
the
following
remarks
of
the
london
with
the
confirmation
of
their
accurate
appreciation
of
the
pride
in
his
own
obtuseness
so
ingenuously
furnished
by
a
writer
in
the
london
tablet
are
a
little
afraid
that
the
anglican
sympathizers
with
the
old
catholics
will
not
be
sharp
enough
to
understand
the
keen
logic
of
father
concise
reasoning
the
british
philistine
rather
glories
in
being
impervious
to
logic
or
wit
and
chuckles
over
his
own
obtuseness
as
a
proof
of
the
strength
of
the
religion
which
he
patronizes
it
is
provoking
to
a
zealous
controversialist
to
have
to
do
battle
with
such
a
heavy
antagonist
but
we
trust
the
good
father
will
not
cease
to
labor
at
the
conversion
of
our
illogical
but
worthy
we
thank
him
for
a
and
the
calls
it
fatal
blow
for
the
theology
of
our
minister
closely
reasoned
and
perfectly
terrible
in
its
manner
of
grasping
its
luckless
september
church
review
rev
cæsar
tondini
who
is
fond
of
linking
russian
orthodoxy
and
anglican
catholicism
in
one
sweeping
condemnation
is
by
no
means
one
of
the
greatest
controversialists
but
this
pamphlet
is
hardly
worthy
of
even

every

own
so
we
forbear
content
for
the
present
to
congratulate
ourselves
on
the
fact
that
while
romanists
are
still
utterly
blind
to
their
own
nakedness
we
have
at
least
plucked
a
by
the
efforts
already
made
to
bring
about
who
could
help
thinking
would
not
give
a
fig
for
such
a
leaf
as
iv
we
will
conclude
the
present
notice
by
some
account
of
the
recent
conference
at
bonn
in
which
the
old
catholics
have
given
abundant
proof
that
they
are
no
freer
from
variation
than
are
any
other
of
the
protestant
sects
desirous
of
strengthening
their
position
by
alliance
with
other
forms
of
schism
von
döllinger
invited
to
a
congress
representatives
of
the
schismatic
greek
and
russian
church
the
english
and
american
episcopalians
and
the
old
catholics
the
assembly
was
called
the
conference
of
the
union
of
the
christian
churches
and
proposed
as
its
object
an
agreement
on
the
fundamental
points
of
doctrine
professed
by
christendom
before
its
divisions
with
a
view
restore
by
a
reform
as
broad
as
possible
the
ancient
catholic
church
of
the
in
this
international
conference
which
began
on
the
of
august
and
ended
on
the
the
principal
orientals
who
numbered
about
twenty
in
all
were
two
bishops
from
roumania
an
archimandrite
from
belgrade
two
archimandrites
anastasiades
and
bryennios
from
constantinople
sent
by
the
patriarch
as
being
well
versed
in
all
the
questions
which
have
divided
and
which
still
divide
the
greek
and
latin
churches
there
were
also
present
the
archbishop
of
syra
and
tino
mgr
licourgos
well
known
in
england
and
six
professors
among
whom
were
profs
osinnin
and
janischef
the
latter
being
the
gentleman
who
at
the
last
conference
was
so
severe
on
anglican
orders
the
protestant
episcopalians
were
the
most
numerous
being
about
a
hundred
in
number
but
they
had
only
one
bishop
among
them
namely
the
bishop
of
gibraltar
those
of
winchester
and
lincoln
who
had
also
given
their
adherence
to
the
movement
found
themselves
at
the
last
moment
unable
to
attend
the
most
notable
person
in
the
anglican
group
was
liddon
canon
of
dean
howson
of
chester
was
also
one
of
its
members
his
on
nearly
every
point
of
church
teaching
being
diametrically
opposed
to
those
of
canon
liddon
the
same
group
contained
an
unitarian
minister
from
chesterfield
smith
and
a
booth
a
chemist
and
druggist
of
the
same
town
who
on
a
late
occasion
was
voted
for
and
returned
at
the
head
of
the
poll
as
an
advocate
of
secular
education
the
americans
sent
only
three
delegates
and
the
one
the
rev
th
de
félice
the
old
catholics
all
of
whom
were
germans
numbered
eighteen
or
twenty
with
von
döllinger
and
bishop
reinkens
at
their
head
supported
by
herr
langen
herr
lange
protestant
and
herr
lang
the
least
orthodox
of
all
close
to
this
little
group
figured
seven
or
eight
more
german
protestants
in
all
the
conference
was
composed
of
about
one
hundred
and
fifty
persons
of
whom
the
observes
that
as
the
gathering
was
it
was
forced
to
display
an
almost
ludicrous
caution
in
drawing
up
such
articles
of
faith
as
would
command
the
assent
of
the
whole
articles
vague
that
they
might
be
made
to
mean
anything
or
and
further
that
the
few
english
divines
who
went
to
bonn
to
play
at
a
council
no
more
represent
the
church
of
england
than
von
döllinger
represents
the
church
of
rome
but
spoke
in
the
name
of
nothing
but
themselves
it
suggests
to
them
with
scornful
irony
that
begins
at
home
and
that
in
the
present
distracted
state
of
the
church
of
england
nothing
keeps
the
various
and
conflicting
of
clergy
in
the
same
communion
but
the
secular
forces
of
the
establishment
there
is
surely
there
a
magnificent
field
for
the
exercise
of
even
a
genius
of
a
bavarian
protestant
clergyman
informed
the
assembly
that
as
there
was
no
chance
of
their
coming
to
an
agreement
by
means
of
discussion
about
dogma
they
had
far
better
throw
over
dogma
altogether
and
trust
to
brotherly
love
to
bring
about
union
von
döllinger
however
said
that
if
they
all
shared
this
opinion
they
had
better
have
stayed
at
home
one
reverend
gentleman
proposed
to
settle
the
difference
by
examining
where
the
fathers
all
harmonize
and
abiding
by
the
result
a
task
which
as
a
observed
would
give
all
the
theological
acuteness
and
learning
in
the
world
abundant
work
for
about
half
a
dozen
centuries
whereupon
bishop
reinkens
nervously
tried
to
draw
the
debaters
into
the
of
love
and
unity
of
purpose
etc
but
here
canon
liddon
hastened
to
the
rescue
with
a
scheme
for
effecting
the
reconciliation
of
the
east
and
west
which
was
apparently
received
by
the
orientals
with
a
tranquil
indifference
and
was
chiefly
remarkable
for
its
adroit
semblance
of
effecting
much
while
it
in
fact
does
nothing
yielding
here
and
there
a
phrase
of
no
special
meaning
it
declared
in
the
next
clause
that
it
would
retain
its
own
form
of
the
creed
until
the
dispute
should
be
settled
by
truly
œcumenical
this
announcement
was
the
signal
for
an
outburst
of
disapproval
questions
and
objections
did
canon
liddon
mean
by
an
œcumenical
council
assent
of
the
whole
this
was
too
much
for
lord
plunkett
who
exclaimed
that
he
would
never
have
come
to
the
conference
if
he
had
known
that
it
meant
to
confine
the
christian
church
within
the
bounds
of
episcopacy
what
he
should
like
to
know
was
to
hinder
presbyterian
ministers
from
being
admitted
equally
with
bishops
to
take
part
in
an
œcumenical
council
on
this
the
canon
obligingly
agreed
to
substitute
whole
for
the
obnoxious
term
but
while
the
assembly
hesitated
some
paragon
of
caution
suggested
the
phrase
however
this
masterpiece
of
conciliation
for
nobody
could
say
what
it
meant
was
rejected
for
whole
church
this
latter
being
equally
ambiguous
to
those
who
were
adopting
it
on
this
they
agreed
as
the
correspondent
observes
will
agree
with
everybody
else
when
all
deliberately
use
words
for
the
purpose
of
concealing
what
they
mean
when
men
differ
from
each
other
essentially
it
is
childish
folly
to
try
to
unite
them
by
an
unmeaning
the
great
question
was
that
of
the
procession
of
the
holy
spirit
on
this
osinnin
was
the
chief
speaker
on
behalf
of
the
greeks
and
he
seems
to
have
challenged
every
interpretation
of
the
westerns
maintaining
even
that
was
not
an
exact
rendering
of
ἐκπορεύεται
however
a
committee
was
appointed
composed
of
the
germans
two
orientals
an
englishman
and
an
american
and
von
döllinger
announced
to
the
conference
on
its
last
sitting
that
an
agreement
had
been
arrived
at
on
all
essential
points
the
greeks
were
to
retain
their
version
of
the
nicene
creed
and
the
westerns
theirs
the
latter
were
to
admit
that
the
had
been
improperly
introduced
and
that
both
were
to
agree
that
whichever
version
they
used
their
meaning
was
that
the
holy
spirit
proceeds
from
the
father
through
the
son
with
regard
to
the
last
point
however
the
orientals
said
that
although
they
had
personally
no
objection
to
the
expression
yet
they
must
decline
to
give
any
official
assent
to
the
article
until
it
had
been
submitted
to
their
synods
or
other
competent
authorities
at
home
judging
from
every
account
we
have
seen
all
of
them
protestant
of
the
bonn
conference
it
is
evident
that
its
members
in
order
to
give
an
appearance
of
mutual
agreement
subscribed
to
propositions
which
may
be
taken
in
various
senses
the
six
articles
agreed
to
by
the
committee
were
couched
in
the
following
terms
believe
with
john
damascene
that
the
holy
spirit
proceeds
from
the
father
as
the
beginning
the
cause
and
the
fountain
of
deity
that
the
holy
spirit
does
not
proceed
from
the
son
ἐκ
τοῦ
υίοῦ
and
that
for
this
reason
there
is
in
the
godhead
only
one
beginning
one
cause
through
which
all
that
is
in
the
godhead
is
produced
that
the
holy
spirit
is
the
image
of
the
son
who
is
the
image
of
the
father
proceeding
from
the
father
and
resting
in
the
son
as
the
outbeaming
power
of
the
latter
the
holy
spirit
is
the
personal
bringing
forth
of
the
father
but
belonging
to
the
son
yet
not
of
the
son
since
he
is
the
spirit
of
the
godhead
which
speaks
forth
the
word
the
holy
spirit
forms
the
connecting
link
between
the
father
and
the
son
and
is
united
to
the
father
through
the
son
the
holy
spirit
proceeds
or
as
amended
by
meyrick
from
the
father
through
the
it
is
the
supposed
denial
of
that
unity
of
the
αρχή
or
originating
principle
in
the
most
holy
trinity
which
has
always
been
the
ground
of
the
greek
objections
to
the
latin
form
of
the
creed
double
of
the
holy
ghost
has
always
been
believed
in
the
church
only
to
a
certain
number
of
minds
it
remained
for
a
time
obscure
and
thus
there
are
to
be
found
in
the
writings
of
the
fathers
passages
in
which
mention
is
made
rather
of
the
procession
from
the
father
than
of
the
double
procession
from
the
father
and
the
son
but
yet
none
which
although
not
formally
indicating
exclude
or
contradict
it
recurring
to
the
expressions
employed
by
the
fathers
the
members
of
the
bonn
conference
have
made
choice
of
some
of
those
which
are
vague
and
least
explicit
instead
of
others
which
convey
to
the
mind
a
clear
idea
we
are
fully
aware
that
from
a
historical
point
of
view
the
question
of
the
presents
some
difficulties
at
nicæa
in
the
question
of
was
not
even
mentioned
from
the
fact
of
its
not
having
up
to
that
time
been
raised
at
constantinople
in
in
order
to
cut
short
discussions
which
were
tending
to
result
in
a
denial
of
the
trinity
the
addition
had
been
made
to
the
creed
that
the
holy
ghost
proceeds
from
the
father
without
mention
of
the
son
at
the
third
council
of
toledo
in
the
faith
of
the
church
in
the
double
procession
was
clearly
indicated
by
the
addition
of
the
an
addition
which
was
adopted
by
several
particular
councils
and
which
became
general
in
france
the
popes
however
foreseeing
that
the
orientals
always
inclined
to
be
towards
the
west
would
make
this
addition
an
excuse
for
breaking
off
into
schism
appeared
at
first
but
little
in
favor
of
a
modification
which
although
expressing
with
greater
accuracy
the
faith
of
the
church
would
furnish
fresh
fuel
to
theological
disputes
it
was
a
question
of
prudence
but
when
the
truth
was
once
placed
in
peril
they
hesitated
no
longer
all
the
west
chanted
the
and
the
greeks
themselves
on
repeated
occasions
and
notably
at
the
council
of
florence
in
confessed
the
double
procession
to
be
an
article
of
the
catholic
the
old
catholics
of
bonn
have
thus
made
as
it
seems
to
us
a
retrogression
on
this
question
will
this
help
to
secure
union
of
the
christian
which
was
the
object
of
the
conference
in
outward
appearance
possibly
it
may
because
all
the
separated
communities
willingly
join
hand
in
hand
against
the
true
church
of
christ
but
in
reality
no
for
the
greeks
will
continue
to
reject
the
procession
through
the
son
as
the
anglicans
will
continue
to
accept
it
and
we
have
no
need
to
say
that
the
catholic
church
will
never
cease
to
confess
the
double
procession
and
to
sing
ex
patre
filioque
with
regard
to
other
subjects
discussed
by
the
meeting
at
bonn
we
will
briefly
mention
that
canon
liddon
spoke
against
the
invocation
of
saints
and
von
döllinger
talked
of
a
clear
of
the
doctrine
of
purgatory
and
indulgences
although
in
stating
the
belief
of
his
he
was
obliged
to
reaffirm
the
doctrine
of
purgatory
in
terms
nearly
equivalent
to
those
of
the
creed
of
pope
pius
iv
on
this
matter
whatever
the
greeks
might
do
how
many
of
the
anglicans
would
agree
with
the
old
catholics
not
only
are
the
people
who
go
to
these
conferences
from
england
in
no
sense
representatives
of
the
body
to
which
they
belong
but
even
they
themselves
do
not
always
abide
by
what
they
have
agreed
to
dean
howson
in
a
statement
he
read
at
the
last
conference
put
a
interpretation
on
the
resolution
of
last
conference
about
the
eucharist
which
interpretation
canon
liddon
immediately
repudiated
before
greek
or
german
schismatics
can
unite
with
the
church
of
england
they
will
have
to
make
up
their
minds
as
to
which
of
at
least
four
theological
systems
anglicanism
and
then
to
get
admitted
by
the
other
three
as
to
the
validity
of
anglican
orders
von
döllinger
appears
to
have
considered
it
as
resting
on
the
certainty
of
consecration
without
going
into
the
really
more
important
questions
of
orders
or
the
sufficiency
of
form
or
intention
all
of
which
are
matters
of
such
grave
doubt
as
to
be
practically
worthless
to
any
one
insisting
upon
the
necessity
of
that
the
communion
to
which
he
belongs
possesses
the
apostolic
succession
we
can
not
conclude
this
sketch
of
the
bonn
conference
without
presenting
our
readers
with
a
portrait
of
its
chief
von
döllinger
drawn
by
a
friendly
hand
that
of
a
french
apostate
priest
and
one
of
the
members
of
the
conference
which
we
reproduce
from
the
pages
of
the
döllinger
he
writes
three
long
and
eloquent
discourses
marked
by
that
seriousness
and
depth
which
so
especially
characterize
his
manner
of
speaking
but
notwithstanding
their
merit
they
have
not
resulted
in
any
new
conclusion
may
not
the
blame
be
in
some
measure
due
to
overbeck
who
introduced
into
the
discussion
authorities
posterior
to
the
epoch
of
the
separation
of
east
and
west
and
mingled
the
question
of
the
seven
œcumenical
councils
with
that
of
the
at
all
events
both
obscurity
and
coldness
found
their
way
into
the
this
excellent
döllinger
seems
fated
to
go
on
from
one
contradiction
to
another
and
to
accept
one
year
that
which
he
refused
in
the
preceding
for
instance
in
at
the
congress
at
munich
he
energetically
opposed
the
organization
of
parishes
afterwards
he
resigned
himself
to
consent
to
this
in
he
desired
the
old
catholics
to
confine
themselves
after
his
example
to
protesting
against
the
excommunication
they
had
incurred
but
later
on
he
is
willing
that
their
priests
should
take
upon
themselves
the
full
exercise
of
their
ministry
in
and
he
wished
to
maintain
the
decisions
of
the
council
of
trent
in
he
decided
to
abandon
them
as
well
as
the
alleged
œcumenicity
of
this
council
in
he
considered
the
attempts
made
to
establish
union
between
the
old
catholics
and
the
oriental
churches
as
at
any
rate
imprudent
if
not
even
compromising
in
he
adopted
the
idea
of
which
he
had
been
so
much
afraid
and
has
since
that
time
used
every
endeavor
to
promote
the
union
of
the
churches
last
year
a
proposal
for
a
committee
to
examine
on
what
points
the
earliest
fathers
harmonized
was
rejected
by
döllinger
with
a
certain
disdain
as
impracticable
and
even
childish
however
we
find
him
obliged
to
come
back
to
it
at
least
in
is
by
no
means
in
reproach
but
in
praise
that
we
say
this
continues
the
writer
adding
accepted
with
the
best
grace
possible
in
one
of
the
sittings
of
the
conference
this
year
the
observations
of
osinnin
on
the
manner
of
studying
texts
and
when
an
erudite
and
venerable
man
like
döllinger
knows
how
to
correct
himself
with
such
humility
he
does
but
raise
himself
in
the
esteem
of
sincere
we
would
here
venture
to
observe
that
when
a
man
as
von
döllinger
and
one
who
is
acknowledged
by
an
entire
sect
as
its
most
distinguished
doctor
and
its
leader
is
so
little
sure
of
his
doctrine
that
he
is
continually
altering
it
he
and
his
followers
are
surely
among
the
last
people
who
ought
to
refuse
to
the
pope
the
infallibility
which
he
in
fact
arrogates
to
himself
in
setting
himself
above
an
œcumenical
council
as
was
that
of
the
vatican
if
the
head
is
represented
by
one
of
the
members
as
being
in
a
chronic
state
of
uncertainty
so
are
the
members
themselves
represented
by
another
in
the
anglican
for
is
an
article
entitled
prospects
the
greater
part
of
which
consists
of
one
of
the
most
abusive
and
malignant
attacks
against
the
catholic
church
and
in
an
especial
manner
against
the
jesuits
that
it
has
ever
been
our
lot
to
come
upon
even
in
the
journal
in
which
it
appears
after
informing
his
readers
that
has
led
the
pope
into
the
egregious
heresy
of
proclaiming
his
own
infallibility
and
that
spirit
of
christ
who
would
not
rest
in
the
vatican
council
where
all
was
confusion
restraint
and
secrecy
has
brooded
over
the
humble
conference
of
trusting
at
bonn
this
person
with
a
sudden
sobriety
ventures
on
a
closer
inspection
of
the
favored
sect
for
which
he
had
just
profanely
claimed
the
guidance
of
the
eternal
spirit
while
denying
it
to
the
œcumenical
council
where
the
whole
episcopate
of
the
catholic
church
was
assembled
with
its
head
the
vicar
of
christ
this
writer
perceives
that
the
other
hand
there
are
dangers
in
the
future
at
present
he
says
body
is
kept
in
order
by
two
master
minds
döllinger
and
schulte
there
are
innumerable
elements
of
he
adds
enough
but
they
are
as
yet
subdued
by
reverence
for
döllinger
and
beat
down
by
the
will
of
the
lay
professor
if
either
of
these
pilots
were
removed
it
is
impossible
to
say
into
how
many
fragments
old
catholicism
might
split
its
bishop
has
no
means
of
control
over
minds
as
have
schulte
and
döllinger
michaelis
is
simply
abusive
and
violent
ready
to
tear
down
with
hands
and
teeth
but
incompetent
to
build
repulsive
in
personal
appearance
his
work
is
that
of
detraction
denunciation
and
destruction
to
human
eyes
the
movement
is
no
movement
at
all
contains
in
itself
no
to
hold
its
members
personally
in
check
and
yet
in
spite
of
every
disadvantage
the
society
is
the
expression
of
true
feeling
etc
but
we
have
dwelt
long
enough
on
this
picture
let
us
in
conclusion
turn
to
a
very
different
one
accepts
no
compromise
she
dictates
laws
says
henri
vignaud
contrasting
her
in
no
friendly
spirit
with
the
sect
we
have
been
contemplating
but
yet
in
a
spirit
of
calmness
and
candor
and
this
which
he
intends
as
a
reproach
is
in
reality
a
commendation
it
is
the
true
church
which
accept
no
compromise
when
the
truth
is
in
question
of
which
she
is
the
faithful
depository
and
whatever
laws
she
dictates
are
to
guard
the
truth
dogmatic
or
moral
issued
in
name
and
with
his
authority
vignaud
acknowledges
this
in
the
following
remarkable
manner
can
not
be
conciliated
which
is
by
nature
irreconcilable
there
can
be
no
compromise
with
either
man
forges
to
himself
the
truths
which
must
illuminate
his
path
or
he
receives
them
from
the
deity
in
which
case
he
must
submit
to
accept
the
dogma
of
infallibility
for
without
this
the
whole
theory
falls
it
is
for
this
reason
that
the
apostolic
roman
catholicity
is
so
strong
subordinating
reason
to
faith
it
does
not
carry
within
it
the
germ
of
any
scepticism
there
can
be
no
transacting
with
it
and
whoever
goes
out
of
it
enters
whether
he
is
aware
of
the
fact
or
not
into
rationalism
of
which
the
logical
outcome
is
the
elimination
of
the
divine
action
in
human
it
would
be
scarcely
possible
to
show
more
clearly
that
there
are
but
two
logical
positions
in
the
world
of
intelligences
namely
catholicity
and
scepticism
or
as
it
is
called
in
the
present
day
positivism
the
next
step
after
refusing
god
all
action
in
human
affairs
is
to
refuse
him
existence
the
conference
at
bonn
however
little
it
may
have
done
in
other
respects
has
already
produced
one
result
which
was
far
from
the
intention
of
its
promoters
it
has
furnished
an
additional
proof
that
there
is
one
church
only
which
is
capable
of
resisting
the
invasion
of
scepticism
and
unbelief
and
that
this
church
is
the
catholic
and
roman
jesus
christ
never
organized
a
church
or
the
catholic
is
the
church
which
he
midnight
mass
in
a
convent
i
have
lately
been
reading
some
remarks
on
the
curious
association
existing
between
certain
tastes
and
odors
and
an
involuntary
exertion
of
the
memory
by
which
the
recurrence
of
those
tastes
or
odors
recalls
with
a
vividness
not
otherwise
to
be
obtained
a
whole
series
of
incidents
of
past
life
incidents
which
with
their
surrounding
scenes
would
otherwise
be
quite
forgotten
and
buried
out
of
sight
by
the
successive
overlaying
of
other
events
of
greater
interest
or
importance
montaigne
has
some
singular
illustrations
of
this
peculiar
fact
of
consciousness
and
there
is
a
brief
reference
to
the
subject
made
in
some
recently
republished
recollections
of
william
hazlitt
connected
with
this
is
the
powerful
influence
known
to
be
exercised
in
many
cases
upon
the
nervous
sensibilities
by
the
exhalation
of
particular
perfumes
or
the
scent
of
certain
kinds
of
flowers
harmless
or
agreeable
to
all
other
persons
there
is
a
reciprocal
motion
of
the
mind
which
has
also
been
noted
by
which
a
particular
train
of
thought
recalls
a
certain
taste
or
smell
almost
as
if
one
received
the
impression
from
the
existing
action
of
the
senses
an
illustration
is
given
in
the
discussion
just
noted
where
a
special
association
of
ideas
is
stated
to
have
brought
back
to
the
writer
with
great
vividness
the
of
a
shop
in
individual
experiences
could
doubtless
be
accumulated
to
show
that
this
mysterious
so
to
term
it
by
means
of
which
the
memory
records
on
its
tablets
by
the
aid
of
a
single
sign
imprinted
upon
a
particular
sense
the
history
of
a
long
series
of
associated
recollections
is
not
confined
to
the
senses
of
taste
and
smell
alone
but
makes
use
of
all
the
recollection
of
one
of
the
happiest
days
of
my
life
a
day
of
strong
excitement
and
vivid
pleasure
but
not
carried
to
the
pitch
of
satiety
is
inseparably
associated
with
the
warm
aromatic
smell
of
a
cigar
which
i
lighted
and
puffed
walking
alone
down
a
country
road
in
this
case
the
train
of
thought
is
followed
by
the
impression
on
the
sense
but
in
another
instance
within
my
experience
the
reciprocal
action
of
thought
and
sense
is
reversed
the
sight
of
a
particular
object
in
this
latter
case
invariably
bringing
back
to
my
mind
with
amazing
distinctness
a
scene
of
altogether
dissimilar
import
lying
far
back
in
the
memory
the
circumstances
are
these
now
some
years
since
i
visited
the
seaport
town
of
shippington
it
is
or
was
one
of
those
sleepy
provincial
cities
which
still
retain
an
odor
about
its
and
ordnance
wharves
a
group
of
ragged
urchins
or
a
man
in
greasy
and
velveteen
jacket
might
be
seen
any
sunny
morning
diligently
fishing
for
hours
off
the
end
of
one
of
its
deserted
piers
for
a
stray
bite
from
a
perch
or
a
flounder
the
arrival
of
the
spring
from
glasgow
bringing
a
renewal
of
stock
for
the
iron
merchants
or
of
a
brig
with
fruit
from
the
mediterranean
used
to
set
the
whole

great
changes
have
taken
place
of
late
years

have
been
built
instead
of
a
single
line
of

steamships

fortnightly
arrival
was
the
event
of
the
day

a
dozen
foreign
and
domestic
lines

the
port
busy
fashion
which
was
once
very
exclusive
and
confined
to
a
few
old
families
has
now
asserted
its
sway
over
wider
ranks
and
the
officers
of
her
gallant
and
the
heavy
swells
of
shippington
society
whose
figures
adorn
the
broad
steps
of
the
shippington
have
now
the
pleasure
of
criticising
any
fine
morning
a
thin
galaxy
of
female
beauty
and
fashion
sweeping
by
them
whose
rival
those
of
beacon
street
or
murray
hill
but
at
the
time
of
which
i
write
when
i
was
a
a
quarter
of
a
century
ago
it
had
not
been
much
stirred
by
the
march
of
these
modern
improvements
her
britannic
majesty
was
then
young
to
the
throne
and
a
great
fervor
of
loyalty
prevailed
and
when
the
royal
welsh
fusileers
used
to
march
down
to
the
for
morning
drill
with
the
martial
and
its
great
bearded
presented
by
the
queen
dividing
the
honors
of
the
head
of
the
regiment
it
would
be
hard
to
exaggerate
the
enthusiasm
that
swelled
the
bosoms
of
the
small
boys
and
african
damsels
who
stepped
proudly
along
with
the
band
those
were
grand
days
pars
magna
when
i
too
marched
down
the
hill
from
the
citadel
with
a
mind
divided
between
awe
and
admiration
of
the
curling
his
mustache
fiercely
and
twirling
his
staff
with
an
air
of
majesty
and
a
latent
terror
of
the
bearded
pet
of
the
regiment
whom
report
declared
to
have
destroyed
three
or
four
boys
in
malta
but
rare
indeed
were
those
holidays
for
i
was
impounded
most
of
the
time
in
a
college
where
the
study
of
the
latin
gave
little
opportunity
for
the
pursuit
of
those
more
attractive
branches
of
a
liberal
education
about
half
a
dozen
of
the
boys
of
whom
i
was
one
were
proficients
at
serving
mass
it
was
therefore
with
great
joy
at
the
distinction
that
we
found
ourselves
named
one
frosty
christmas
eve
to
accompany
father
w
to
the
convent
of
the
sacred
heart
about
a
mile
distant
where
he
was
to
celebrate
midnight
mass
oh
how
the
snow
crisped
and
rattled
under
our
feet
as
we
marched
along
full
of
importance
after
father
w
each
boy
with
his
green
bag
containing
his
surplice
and
swung
over
his
arm
what
a
jolly
night
it
was
and
how
the
stars
twinkled
we
slapped
our
hands
together
protected
by
our
thick
blue
mitts
and
stamped
our
feet
like
soldiers
on
the
march
to
moscow
it
was
after
ten
and
the
streets
were
dark
and
nearly
deserted
to
us
long
used
to
be
sound
asleep
at
that
hour
in
our
warm
dormitory
each
boy
in
his
own
little
with
the
moonlight
streaming
in
through
the
windows
on
its
white
counterpane
and
not
daring
if
we
were
awake
so
much
as
to
whisper
to
the
boy
next
to
us
under
pain
of
condign
punishment
in
the
morning
there
was
something
mysterious
and
almost
ghostly
in
this
midnight
adventure
as
we
passed
the
near
the
residence
the
officer
of
the
night
muffled
in
his
cloak
came
along
on
the
the
sentry
in
his
tall
hat
stops
suddenly
short
in
his
walk
goes
there
he
calls
out
in
a
loud
fierce
voice
bringing
down
his
bayonet
to
the
charge
we
clung
closer
to
father
w
skirts
replies
the
officer
in
a
voice
of
command
his
sword
rattling
on
the
ground
with
the
frost
rounds
rounds
grand
rounds
and
give
the
countersign
then
the
sergeant
of
the
guard
the
alarm
being
given
rushes
out
into
the
street
with
his
men
all
with
bayonets
drawn
and
looking
terrible
in
the
moonlight
they
form
in
line
and
the
officer
advances
a
whispered
conversation
takes
place
the
soldiers
present
arms
and
march
back
into
the
warm
and
the
officer
passes
silently
on
to
the
next
guard
while
this
scene
was
going
on
we
stood
half
terrified
and
fascinated
hardly
knowing
whether
to
take
to
our
heels
or
not
but
the
calm
voice
of
father
w
as
he
answered
to
the
challenge
reassured
us
soon
we
reached
the
convent
gate
and
entering
the
grounds
which
were
open
for
the
occasion
found
the
convent
all
ablaze
with
lights
the
parents
and
friends
of
the
young
lady
pupils
were
permitted
to
attend
the
midnight
christmas
mass
the
convent
and
convent
chapel
which
communicated
with
it
stood
in
the
midst
of
winding
walks
and
lawns
very
pretty
in
the
summer
but
the
tall
trees
now
stripped
of
their
leaves
swung
their
bare
branches
in
the
wind
with
a
melancholy
recollection
of
their
faded
beauty
groups
in
twos
and
threes
walked
silently
up
the
paths
muffled
in
cloaks
and
shawls
and
disappeared
within
the
chapel
we
were
received
by
the
mme
p
whose
kind
voice
and
refined
and
gentle
manners
were
sadly
maligned
by
a
formidable
roman
nose
that
struck
our
youthful
minds
with
awe
what
unprincipled
whims
does
nature
sometimes
take
thus
to
impress
upon
the
countenance
the
appearance
of
a
character
so
alien
to
our
true
disposition
nor
is
it
less
true
that
a
beautiful
face
and
a
form
that
heaven
has
endowed
with
all
the
charms
of
grace
and
fascinating
beauty
may
hide
a
soul
rank
with
vice
and
malice
the
becky
sharpes
of
the
world
are
not
all
as
as
heroine
whom
nevertheless
with
much
truth
to
art
he
represents
as
attractive
and
alluring
in
her
prime
but
dear
mme
p
roman
nose
was
not
i
have
reason
to
believe
without
its
advantages
the
fortuitous
severity
of
its
cast
helping
to
maintain
a
degree
of
discipline
among
her
young
lady
boarders
which
a
tendency
to
what
tennyson
calls
least
little
delicate
a
pug
or
even
a
purely
classical
grecian
might
have
failed
to
inspire
forgive
me
the
treason
if
i
venture
even
to
hint
that
those
young
ladies
in
white
and
blue
who
floated
in
and
out
of
mme
p
parlors
on
like
angels
cut
out
from
the
canvas
on
the
walls
were
ever
less
demure
than
their
prototypes
we
were
marshalled
into
a
long
narrow
hall
running
parallel
with
the
chapel
there
we
busied
ourselves
in
putting
on
our
red
and
white
surplices
and
preparing
the
altar
for
mass
but
we
had
a
long
time
to
wait
and
while
we
stood
there
in
whispering
silence
and
the
chapel
slowly
filled
suddenly
appeared
mme
p
with
a
lay
sister
carrying
six
little
china
plates
full
of
red
and
white
and
some
cakes
not
bigger
than
a
mouthful
to
beguile
our
tedium
to
this
day
the
sight
of
one
of
those
small
plates
filled
with
that
kind
of
brings
back
to
my
mind
with
wonderful
minuteness
all
the
scenes
i
have
described
and
those
that
followed
the
long
walk
through
the
snow
the
the
convent
grounds
the
figures
of
mme
p
and
her
lay
sister
advancing
towards
us
rise
before
me
undimmed
by
time
and
even
now
as
i
write
the
flavor
of
the
sugared
seems
to
be
in
my
mouth
though
it
is
over
twenty
years
ago
since
i
cracked
them
between
my
teeth
with
a
relish
for
sweetmeats
the
feeling
of
distant
respect
engendered
by
the
sight
of
mme
p
nose
gave
way
all
at
once
to
a
profound
sympathy
and
admiration
for
that
estimable
lady
as
she
handed
us
those
dainties
yet
as
they
disappeared
before
our
juvenile
appetites
sharpened
by
the
frost
we
could
not
help
feeling
all
a
contempt
for
the
girls
that
could
be
satisfied
with
such
stuff
instead
of
a
good
solid
piece
of
gingerbread
that
a
fellow
could
get
two
or
three
bites
at
we
had
no
doubt
that
the
convent
girls
had
a
that
day
and
that
this
was
a
part
of
the
feast
that
had
been
provided
for
them
we
marched
gravely
into
the
sanctuary
before
father
w
and
took
our
places
around
the
while
he
ascended
the
altar
a
deeper
hush
seemed
to
fall
on
the
congregation
kneeling
with
heads
bowed
down
before
the
saviour
born
on
that
blessed
morning
the
lights
on
the
altar
burned
with
a
mystical
halo
at
the
midnight
hour
the
roses
around
the
crib
of
the
infant
redeemer
bloomed
brighter
than
june
we
heaped
the
incense
into
the
burning
censer
and
the
smoke
rushed
up
in
a
cloud
and
the
odorous
sweetness
filled
the
air
then
along
the
vaulted
roof
of
the
chapel
stole
the
first
notes
of
the
organ
now
rising
now
falling
and
the
murmuring
voice
of
the
priest
was
heard
reading
the
missal
did
my
heart
stand
still
when
a
boy
or
is
it
touched
by
a
memory
later
as
birdlike
the
pure
tones
of
the
soprano
rose
filling
the
church
and
thrilling
the
whole
congregation
marvellous
magic
of
music
can
we
wonder
to
see
an
arion
borne
by
dolphins
over
the
waves
and
stilling
the
winds
with
his
lyre
poor
mme
l
she
had
a
voice
of
astonishing
brilliancy
and
power
her
upper
notes
i
have
never
heard
excelled
in
clearness
and
sustained
roundness
of
tone
when
i
heard
her
years
later
with
a
more
experienced
ear
her
voice
though
a
good
deal
worn
was
still
one
to
be
singled
out
wherever
it
might
be
heard
she
is
since
dead
she
was
a
french
lady
of
good
family
her
voice
had
the
tone
of
an
exile
she
sang
the
on
that
christmas
morning
with
a
pathos
that
impressed
me
so
much
as
a
boy
that
the
same
hymn
sung
by
celebrated
singers
and
more
pretentious
choirs
has
always
appeared
to
me
tame
it
would
not
serve
my
present
purpose
to
pursue
these
recollections
farther
enough
has
been
said
to
show
how
quickly
the
mind
grasps
at
some
one
prominent
point
affected
by
sense
to
group
around
it
a
tableau
of
associated
recollections
that
little
china
with
its
blue
and
gilt
edge
heaped
over
with
brings
back
to
me
scenes
that
seem
to
belong
to
another
age
so
radical
is
the
change
which
time
makes
in
the
fortunes
and
even
emotions
of
men
when
the
lights
were
all
out
in
the
chapel
except
those
that
burned
around
the
crib
and
the
congregation
had
silently
departed
we
wended
our
way
back
to
the
college
with
father
w
in
the
chill
morning
air
more
slowly
than
when
we
started
sleepy
but
our
courage
still
unabated
by
reason
of
the
great
things
we
had
shared
in
and
the
still
greater
things
separated
from
us
by
only
one
more
dawn
we
slept
like
tops
all
the
morning
being
excused
from
six
mass
on
account
of
our
midnight
excursion
when
we
joined
the
home
circle
on
christmas
morning
you
may
be
assured
we
had
plenty
to
talk
about
nor
was
it
until
after
dinner
and
all
the
walnuts
had
been
cracked
and
our
new
pair
of
skates
our
most
prized
christmas
gift
tried
on
and
admired
that
the
recollection
of
our
first
christmas
mass
began
to
fade
from
our
minds
pure
hearts
and
innocent
joys
of
youth
how
smooth
the
stream
auræ
on
which
it
sails
its
tiny
craft
how
rough
the
sea
it
drifts
into
bell
bell
how
grandly
swell
its
matin
chime
its
noonday
peal
its
vesper
rhyme
how
deeply
in
my
heart
i
feel
their
solemn
cadence
they
to
me
waft
hymns
of
precious
melody
bell
what
memories
dwell
enshrined
among
each
lingering
note
and
tuneful
tongue
as
on
the
quivering
air
they
float
those
sweet
vibrations
and
bear
tidings
from
a
shore
bell
what
clouds
dispel
what
doubts
and
fears
dissolve
away
what
sorrowing
tears
like
mists
before
the
rising
day
while
on
the
waiting
listening
air
rings
out
call
to
prayer
bell
ring
on
and
tell
in
matin
chime
and
noonday
peal
and
vesper
rhyme
and
let
thy
joyful
notes
reveal
the
story
loved
of
mortals
best
of
holy
child
on
breast
while
herald
angels
from
above
sang
anthems
of
eternal
love
bell
when
farewell
upon
my
parting
lips
shall
dwell
and
when
i
rise
on
angel
wing
to
seek
the
gates
of
paradise
and
stand
before
the
heavenly
king
though
in
that
realm
of
perfect
peace
all
other
earthly
sounds
should
cease
methinks
be
a
joy
to
me
once
more
to
hear
with
bended
ear
the
music
loved
on
earth
so
well
the
echoes
of
bell
from
cairo
to
jerusalem
seated
in
the
spacious
hall
of
the
new
hotel
in
cairo
we
discussed
a
tour
through
the
holy
land
we
had
quitted
our
comfortable
and
wherein
we
had
lived
for
nearly
four
months
upon
the
waters
of
the
historical
nile
a
sad
farewell
had
been
said
to
our
trusty
sailors
and
even
those
of
them
who
had
lingered
around
the
hotel
for
days
after
our
arrival
to
kiss
our
hands
as
we
came
out
had
now
taken
their
departure
old
abiad
our
funny
man
had
for
once
worn
a
sober
look
as
he
bade
us
on
our
homeward
voyage
said
the
indefatigable
muscular
said
ever
ready
for
the
hardest
work
and
ever
foremost
in
action
had
left
us
with
tearful
eyes
and
had
started
on
his
upward
voyage
to
keneh
to
marry
the
young
moslem
maiden
to
whom
he
had
pledged
his
troth
some
few
months
before
yes
the
nile
trip
was
really
over
but
on
the
tablets
of
memory
was
painted
a
most
bright
and
beautiful
picture
which
time
alone
could
efface
still
another
separation
one
of
our
party
having
been
in
the
holy
land
the
previous
year
was
about
to
remain
in
egypt
while
the
rest
of
us
visited
syria
father
h
mme
d
and
the
writer
made
the
travelling
party
the
plans
were
soon
settled
and
a
day
was
appointed
upon
which
we
should
depart
from
cairo
to
meet
the
russian
steamer
which
was
advertised
to
leave
alexandria
on
monday
april
the
one
of
the
greatest
difficulties
in
travelling
in
the
east
is
to
obtain
accurate
information
concerning
the
arrival
and
departure
of
steamers
and
trains
when
inquiring
what
time
the
train
would
leave
cairo
for
rhoda
the
terminus
of
the
railway
along
the
nile
i
was
informed
that
it
would
leave
somewhere
about
seven
in
the
morning
and
would
reach
rhoda
between
six
and
eight
in
the
evening
this
was
the
most
accurate
information
i
could
possibly
obtain
in
point
of
fact
the
train
left
cairo
at
nine
and
reached
rhoda
at
ten
at
night
on
monday
morning
april
there
was
a
general
clearing
out
of
travellers
from
the
hotel
at
nine
and
for
a
wonder
punctual
to
the
minute
we
left
the
station
at
cairo
on
the
train
going
to
ismailïa
we
passed
through
some
of
the
richest
country
of
the
delta
teeming
with
life
and
activity
the
or
persian
were
sending
their
streams
of
water
through
the
numberless
little
canals
on
every
hand
here
a
line
of
laden
camels
march
along
with
stately
step
there
a
family
father
mother
and
son
accompanied
by
the
omnipresent
donkey
called
to
mind
the
flight
of
the
holy
family
into
egypt
and
well
they
may
for
here
we
are
in
the
land
of
goshen
at
rameses
the
home
of
the
israelites
the
of
their
long
dreary
wanderings
now
the
railroad
marks
the
line
between
the
cultivated
land
and
the
sandy
plains
of
the
desert
on
one
side
rich
vegetation
nurtured
by
the
canal
on
the
other
sandy
hillocks
stretching
away
to
the
line
of
the
horizon
and
in
a
few
moments
we
see
the
deep
rich
blue
of
the
water
of
lake
timsah
contrasting
most
strikingly
with
the
golden
sand
of
its
desert
bank
ismailïa
ere
the
train
has
stopped
we
are
surrounded
by
a
crowd
of
arabs
thirsting
for
their
spoil
a
score
of
them
pounce
upon
our
baggage
after
considerable
shouting
and
threatening
we
compromise
and
a
truce
is
proclaimed
we
engaged
two
of
them
to
carry
our
baggage
to
the
steamer
on
the
lake
o
porters
of
the
united
states
how
you
would
blush
and
hang
your
heads
in
shame
to
see
these
arabs
handle
baggage
in
my
childish
and
untravelled
simplicity
i
thought
it
most
wonderful
to
see
you
lift
those
heavy
miscalled
trunks
and
carry
them
to
the
fourth
story
of
a
hotel
but
hereafter
for
porters
commend
me
to
the
arabs
we
had
four
or
five
heavy
valises
one
of
them
weighing
nearly
one
hundred
pounds
and
numberless
small
parcels
one
of
the
men
hung
these
valises
from
his
neck
and
tying
the
smaller
parcels
in
among
them
as
though
by
way
of
ornament
started
off
followed
by
his
brother
porter
with
our
only
trunk
a
large
and
very
heavy
one
strapped
on
his
back
they
walked
at
a
brisk
pace
to
the
boat
about
one
mile
distant
and
did
not
seem
in
the
least
fatigued
when
they
arrived
there
as
we
started
to
walk
down
the
long
avenue
leading
to
the
lake
we
were
beset
as
usual
by
the
importunities
of
three
or
four
each
one
recounting
the
praises
of
his
own
animal
and
speaking
disparagingly
of
the
others
yet
all
in
the
best
possible
humor
running
here
and
there
dragging
after
them
the
patient
donkey
they
cried
out
good
donkey
sah
look
him
oder
donkey
no
good
him
back
break
him
exquisite
donkey
sah
him
yankee
doodle
suddenly
in
a
fit
of
indignation
i
turned
upon
them
and
howled
at
the
top
of
my
voice
ya
out
o
dog
when
with
a
roar
of
laughter
one
little
imp
jumped
in
front
of
me
and
exclaimed
howadji
can
speak
arabic
him
good
arab
donkey
take
him
sah
him
speak
notwithstanding
this
great
inducement
i
did
not
take
him
like
palace
ismailïa
has
sprung
up
almost
in
a
single
night
in
the
site
of
the
present
town
was
a
barren
waste
of
sand
but
when
the
canal
was
completed
to
this
place
and
the
magic
waters
of
the
nile
were
let
loose
upon
it
the
golden
sands
of
the
desert
gave
place
to
the
rich
verdure
of
vegetation
gardens
filled
with
the
choicest
fruits
and
flowers
sprang
up
on
every
hand
indeed
it
seems
but
necessary
to
pour
the
waters
of
the
nile
on
the
desert
to
produce
a
soil
which
will
grow
anything
to
perfection
here
we
see
the
pretty
little
swiss
of
de
lesseps
and
a
short
distance
beyond
the
palace
of
the
viceroy
built
in
a
few
months
for
the
purpose
of
entertaining
his
illustrious
guest
at
the
opening
of
the
suez
canal
what
singular
fellows
these
arabs
are
our
two
porters
demand
three
rupees
a
rupee
is
worth
about
fifty
cents
for
their
services
i
quietly
take
one
rupee
from
my
pocket
and
offer
it
to
them
indignantly
they
reject
it
and
if
i
will
not
give
them
what
they
ask
they
will
accept
nothing
at
all
and
with
loud
words
and
angry
gestures
they
shout
and
gesticulate
most
vehemently
complaining
of
the
insignificant
pittance
i
offer
them
for
the
hard
work
they
have
just
gone
through
i
repocket
the
rupee
and
proceed
very
leisurely
to
arrange
our
places
on
the
little
postal
boat
which
is
to
leave
in
about
an
hour
having
purchased
tickets
and
seen
that
everything
was
properly
arranged
i
again
return
to
the
attack
as
i
am
now
upon
the
offensive
and
offer
them
the
rupee
no
they
will
not
have
it
but
now
they
will
accept
two
rupees
well
it
being
the
rule
of
eastern
negotiations
that
as
one
party
comes
down
the
other
should
go
up
like
a
balance
i
increase
the
rupee
by
a
franc
and
after
much
talking
they
agree
to
accept
it
but
now
what
a
change
comes
over
them
finding
that
they
have
extracted
from
me
all
that
they
possibly
can
their
whole
manner
changes
and
they
become
as
polite
and
affable
as
you
please
they
thank
me
proffer
their
services
to
do
anything
for
me
that
i
may
wish
kiss
their
hands
in
respectful
salutation
and
are
off
our
steamer
is
somewhat
larger
than
a
boat
and
our
little
company
is
soon
assembled
in
the
cabin
besides
ourselves
there
are
first
a
voluble
young
russian
who
came
with
us
from
cairo
and
who
precipitates
himself
most
desperately
into
the
strongest
friendships
that
the
time
will
allow
with
every
one
he
meets
telling
you
all
about
himself
and
his
family
and
then
finding
out
as
much
as
he
can
about
you
and
yours
next
a
stolid
saxon
prussian
at
cairo
a
very
pleasant
and
intelligent
young
man
and
lastly
a
quiet
retiring
young
italian
lady
who
unable
to
speak
any
language
besides
her
own
can
not
join
in
the
general
conversation
which
is
carried
on
principally
in
french
at
six
we
left
the
at
ismailïa
and
passing
out
the
northeast
corner
of
lake
timsah
we
entered
the
narrow
cutting
of
el
guisr
the
surface
of
these
heights
is
the
highest
point
in
the
isthmus
of
suez
being
from
sixty
to
feet
above
the
level
of
the
sea
in
cutting
the
canal
through
this
part
they
were
obliged
to
dig
down
some
ninety
feet
in
order
to
give
the
canal
its
proper
depth
below
the
sea
level
just
after
we
entered
this
cutting
the
strong
north
wind
which
was
blowing
at
the
time
caught
parasol
whirled
it
out
of
her
hand
blew
it
overboard
and
the
last
we
saw
of
it
it
was
floating
placidly
along
toward
suez
one
sees
here
how
perceptibly
the
sand
is
filling
up
the
trench
and
the
are
kept
in
constant
operation
to
keep
the
channel
clear
at
dusk
we
passed
a
large
english
steamer
tied
up
for
the
night
as
large
steamers
are
never
allowed
to
travel
in
the
canal
after
dark
we
soon
entered
lake
menzaleh
and
continued
through
it
some
miles
to
port
said
fifteen
years
ago
a
belt
of
sand
from
six
to
nine
hundred
feet
in
width
occupied
the
place
where
port
said
now
stands
here
in
april
de
lesseps
surrounded
by
a
handful
of
europeans
and
a
score
of
native
workmen
gave
the
first
blow
of
the
spade
to
that
great
channel
of
communication
between
the
east
and
the
west
soon
the
ground
for
the
future
town
was
made
houses
erected
gardens
laid
out
and
port
said
is
a
town
of
nearly
ten
thousand
inhabitants
with
streets
squares
gardens
docks
quays
mosques
churches
and
a
very
safe
and
harbor
the
name
port
said
was
given
to
it
in
honor
of
the
then
viceroy
said
pasha
the
next
morning
when
i
went
to
the
office
to
purchase
tickets
i
was
informed
by
the
not
clerk
in
the
russian
steamship
office
that
notwithstanding
it
was
advertised
that
the
steamer
would
leave
alexandria
on
monday
it
would
not
leave
until
tuesday
and
consequently
would
not
leave
port
said
until
wednesday
afternoon
another
illustration
of
the
uncertainty
of
travelling
information
in
the
east
in
the
afternoon
i
determined
to
go
down
to
the
lake
and
endeavor
to
shoot
some
flamingoes
or
pelicans
both
of
which
abound
here
in
great
numbers
leaving
the
town
i
started
to
cross
the
wide
level
plain
which
separated
it
as
i
supposed
from
the
lake
some
distance
ahead
i
saw
numerous
birds
disporting
themselves
amid
the
glistening
and
sparkling
waters
of
the
lake
after
walking
for
nearly
an
hour
i
reached
the
spot
but
no
lake
was
there
and
turning
around
i
saw
it
at
the
point
from
which
i
had
started
somewhat
confused
i
turned
towards
the
sea
and
there
i
saw
high
up
in
the
air
a
with
women
walking
upon
it
and
a
little
further
on
two
gigantic
figures
like
moving
toward
me
in
the
air
in
a
moment
the
truth
flashed
upon
me
it
was
a
mirage
and
retracing
my
steps
to
the
town
i
found
that
the
lake
was
in
a
different
direction
from
the
one
i
had
taken
the
next
day
we
went
on
board
the
steamer
which
arrived
from
alexandria
about
ten
in
the
morning
there
is
considerable
excitement
on
board
and
a
number
of
boats
with
trim
crews
rapidly
approaching
us
announce
the
arrival
of
de
lesseps
with
his
wife
and
her
two
nieces
for
a
pilgrimage
to
the
holy
land
de
lesseps
is
a
man
of
medium
height
rather
stout
and
with
a
very
and
countenance
he
wears
a
heavy
gray
mustache
and
his
hair
is
silvery
white
his
appearance
is
that
of
a
man
of
great
energy
and
determination
and
one
to
project
and
carry
through
the
colossal
work
he
has
so
successfully
executed
the
ship
was
very
much
crowded
or
perhaps
it
would
be
more
correct
to
say
that
the
accommodations
were
very
limited
as
we
did
not
have
more
than
fifty
passengers
on
board
and
yet
there
were
not
sufficient
accommodations
for
them
in
the
first
cabin
father
h
and
i
together
with
a
young
austrian
with
whom
we
had
become
acquainted
at
port
said
were
obliged
to
sleep
in
a
cabin
we
were
told
that
they
would
so
arrange
it
that
we
could
eat
in
the
first
saloon
and
at
we
found
a
small
set
for
four
of
us
to
eat
from
however
it
was
quite
large
enough
for
me
for
i
had
not
been
seated
many
minutes
before
i
felt
an
unaccountable
desire
to
go
on
deck
and
inhale
the
fresh
air
having
done
so
i
retired
for
the
night
bright
and
early
the
next
morning
i
was
upon
deck
but
i
found
father
h
there
before
me
madame
having
a
very
comfortable
room
in
the
first
cabin
had
not
yet
risen
the
sea
was
still
and
calm
as
a
pond
and
turning
my
face
toward
the
east
i
beheld
for
the
first
time
the
mountain
ranges
of
judæa
yea
there
before
me
was
judæa
the
land
promised
and
given
to
the
seed
of
abraham
there
among
those
hills
samson
had
performed
his
exploits
of
power
there
the
royal
david
and
the
wise
solomon
had
lived
and
reigned
ay
and
there
one
greater
than
them
all
the
was
born
lived
and
laid
down
his
life
for
the
salvation
of
mankind
and
was
it
really
true
that
i
an
inquisitive
yankee
of
the
xixth
century
was
soon
to
tread
those
sacred
spots
hallowed
with
reminiscences
so
dear
to
the
heart
of
every
christian
i
could
scarce
believe
it
was
i
not
in
a
dream
and
would
i
not
soon
awake
to
find
it
all
a
beautiful
but
fleeting
vision
no
it
was
true
and
it
was
made
most
painfully
apparent
by
the
harsh
clangor
of
the
arab
boatmen
and
their
frantic
endeavors
to
take
possession
of
us
as
our
ship
dropped
anchor
off
the
town
of
jaffa
there
is
no
harbor
of
any
kind
here
and
when
the
sea
is
calm
the
steamers
anchor
about
one
mile
from
the
shore
and
passengers
and
their
baggage
are
landed
in
small
boats
immediately
in
front
of
the
town
and
but
a
short
distance
from
it
a
series
of
rocks
forms
a
wall
broken
only
by
two
channels
or
gateways
one
about
ten
feet
in
width
and
the
other
a
little
wider
through
these
the
sea
dashes
with
tremendous
fury
and
as
the
little
boat
approaches
it
is
caught
upon
the
summit
of
some
breaker
and
dashed
through
the
opening
into
the
quiet
haven
behind
when
it
is
stormy
the
steamers
do
not
stop
here
at
all
but
land
their
passengers
a
short
distance
farther
up
the
coast
the
bright
genial
face
of
father
guido
president
of
the
casa
nuova
soon
welcomed
us
to
palestine
he
had
come
down
from
jerusalem
to
meet
de
lesseps
and
to
offer
him
the
hospitality
of
their
convent
which
was
thankfully
accepted
we
soon
disembarked
and
entered
a
small
boat
accompanied
by
our
trusty
dragoman
ali
aboo
suleyman
who
had
travelled
with
one
of
our
party
the
previous
year
and
whom
i
believe
to
be
one
of
the
best
dragomans
in
the
east
our
boat
propelled
by
the
strong
arms
of
a
of
powerful
arabs
soon
brought
us
alongside
of
the
town
passing
through
a
narrow
gateway
and
giving
a
substantial
and
material
wink
to
the
revenue
official
we
with
our
baggage
were
soon
deposited
at
the
door
of
the
latin
convent
after
greeting
the
kind
and
hospitable
fathers
and
arranging
terms
with
ali
we
started
out
for
a
short
walk
traversing
the
narrow
tortuous
streets
and
filthy
alleys
jostled
by
camels
horses
donkeys
and
preceded
by
achmud
youngest
son
a
lad
of
fourteen
years
who
with
a
pompous
and
authoritative
air
pushed
aside
old
men
and
young
women
and
children
and
would
have
done
the
same
with
the
camels
had
he
been
able
to
make
room
for
the
howadji
we
reached
the
spot
where
stood
in
former
days
the
house
of
simon
the
tanner
here
the
apostle
peter
resided
many
days
and
here
he
saw
the
vision
of
the
clean
and
unclean
beasts
wherein
the
voice
commanded
him
saying
peter
kill
and
a
small
mosque
now
occupies
the
site
of
the
house
the
streets
were
thronged
with
russian
pilgrims
returning
from
their
easter
pilgrimage
to
the
holy
city
many
of
them
will
leave
in
the
afternoon
on
the
steamer
which
has
brought
us
from
egypt
and
in
a
few
short
days
will
be
at
odessa
whence
the
railway
will
carry
them
to
petersburg
about
three
in
the
afternoon
accompanied
by
an
irish
priest
who
had
lived
in
malta
for
several
years
we
mounted
our
horses
and
started
for
jerusalem
we
had
been
most
hospitably
entertained
by
the
kind
fathers
at
the
convent
a
large
room
and
an
excellent
breakfast
had
been
provided
for
us
but
no
remuneration
asked
we
of
course
made
a
donation
which
was
thankfully
received
we
rode
through
the
narrow
streets
passed
out
the
gate
and
in
a
few
moments
were
among
the
of
jaffa
the
sky
was
cloudless
the
weather
like
a
beautiful
may
day
at
home
and
the
air
heavy
with
the
delicious
fragrance
of
the
oranges
we
rode
for
nearly
a
mile
through
these
beautiful
groves
meanwhile
ali
provided
himself
with
numbers
of
these
large
oranges
and
soon
for
the
first
time
i
tasted
an
orange
that
i
really
enjoyed
just
plucked
from
the
tree
with
skin
half
an
inch
in
thickness
and
without
seeds
this
luscious
fruit
seems
almost
to
dissolve
in
the
mouth
like
ali
owns
a
large
grove
from
which
he
gathers
about
one
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
oranges
per
annum
these
he
sells
in
large
quantities
at
the
rate
of
two
pounds
sterling
per
thousand
yielding
him
a
very
nice
income
as
the
expense
of
taking
care
of
them
is
very
small
now
we
are
riding
along
the
level
plain
which
separates
the
judæan
hills
from
the
bright
blue
waters
of
the
mediterranean
and
a
little
after
six
we
drew
rein
at
the
latin
convent
in
ramleh
it
is
almost
useless
for
me
to
speak
of
the
kindness
and
hospitality
of
these
good
franciscan
fathers
of
the
holy
land
as
it
is
known
throughout
the
world
and
abler
pens
than
mine
have
endeavored
but
in
vain
to
praise
them
as
they
deserve
unselfish
kind
burying
self
completely
in
the
great
work
they
have
undertaken
they
have
given
up
their
homes
families
and
all
that
was
dear
to
them
to
live
a
monastic
life
among
these
sacred
spots
to
guard
these
holy
places
and
like
ministering
angels
to
assist
pilgrims
from
every
clime
and
of
every
christian
race
and
nationality
clad
in
the
humble
garb
of
their
order
they
go
quietly
and
unostentatiously
through
life
sacrificing
themselves
at
every
turn
for
the
benefit
and
comfort
of
others
they
have
stood
through
centuries
a
devoted
band
of
chivalrous
knights
guarding
the
spots
rendered
sacred
by
the
presence
of
their
god
may
he
in
his
goodness
reward
them
by
permitting
them
to
stand
as
a
noble
guard
of
honor
around
his
celestial
throne
in
the
heavenly
hereafter
after
a
comfortable
rest
and
a
good
breakfast
we
started
at
six
in
order
to
avoid
the
intense
heat
of
midday
de
lesseps
and
party
had
preceded
us
by
nearly
two
hours
as
we
rode
out
the
convent
gate
numbers
of
lepers
with
shrunken
limbs
and
distorted
countenances
clamored
piteously
for
alms
we
dropped
some
small
coins
into
their
tin
boxes
which
they
carry
so
that
there
may
be
no
possibility
of
contact
with
the
compassionate
who
may
bestow
alms
upon
them
we
rode
for
some
time
across
a
level
plain
and
near
ten
reached
gate
of
the
valley
at
the
foot
of
the
mountain
range
here
we
found
a
very
comfortable
house
which
has
been
erected
for
the
sake
of
affording
accommodation
to
pilgrims
we
lunched
here
took
a
short
nap
and
started
on
our
way
about
two
in
the
afternoon
the
whole
distance
from
jaffa
to
jerusalem
is
not
over
miles
but
fast
riding
is
not
practicable
on
account
of
the
baggage
which
is
transported
on
mules
at
a
very
slow
pace
consequently
it
generally
requires
two
days
to
make
the
trip
whereas
a
moderately
fast
horse
could
easily
accomplish
the
journey
in
seven
or
eight
hours
we
now
enter
wady
ali
one
could
scarcely
imagine
a
more
suitable
place
for
lurking
bandits
to
conceal
themselves
in
than
among
the
thick
undergrowth
here
their
might
almost
touch
their
unconscious
breast
without
being
visible
and
many
a
tale
has
been
told
and
retold
around
the
of
their
exploits
of
robbery
and
murder
in
this
place
but
now
thanks
to
the
strict
though
tardy
vigilance
of
the
sultan
the
pass
is
free
from
danger
what
feelings
of
emotion
now
fill
my
breast
the
dreams
of
my
childhood
are
being
realized
i
am
in
the
holy
land
reaching
the
summit
of
one
of
the
ridges
a
beautiful
panorama
is
spread
out
before
us
at
our
feet
lies
the
valley
of
sharon
dressed
in
the
richest
green
and
ornamented
with
the
bright
beautiful
wild
flowers
of
early
spring
beyond
lies
the
plain
of
ramleh
and
in
the
distance
like
a
silver
frame
sparkles
and
glistens
the
bright
waters
of
the
mediterranean
anon
we
see
beneath
us
the
beautiful
valley
of
beit
hanina
and
ali
laying
one
hand
on
my
shoulder
points
to
a
little
village
nestled
amid
the
in
the
valley
yes
that
is
the
place
of
the
visitation
of
the
blessed
virgin
the
spot
where
was
born
the
of
we
check
our
horses
but
for
a
moment
we
have
no
eyes
for
that
now
every
gaze
is
fixed
upon
that
small
yellow
house
upon
the
top
of
the
opposite
hill
for
has
not
ali
told
us
that
from
that
point
we
shall
see
the
eternal
city
riding
rapidly
down
the
we
do
not
even
stop
as
we
cross
the
brook
where
david
gathered
the
pebbles
with
which
he
slew
his
gigantic
adversary
and
push
rapidly
up
the
opposite
mountain
father
h
and
i
are
in
advance
while
madame
rides
behind
with
the
irish
priest
the
shades
of
evening
are
now
falling
and
i
fear
lest
night
may
come
on
before
we
reach
the
city
scarce
a
word
is
spoken
my
heart
beats
with
excitement
such
as
it
has
never
known
before
and
seems
as
though
it
would
break
through
its
so
eager
so
anxious
is
it
to
move
quickly
on
unable
to
restrain
my
impatience
i
give
my
horse
a
blow
with
my
and
he
starts
on
a
full
run
father
h
calls
me
back
we
have
travelled
so
long
and
shared
so
many
pleasures
together
let
us
together
share
the
great
pleasure
of
the
first
sight
of
jerusalem
i
rein
in
my
horse
and
ride
by
his
side
now
the
top
of
the
hill
is
reached
and
it
is
yet
light
but
we
have
mistaken
the
house
it
is
another
one
still
farther
on
it
is
now
twilight
we
speak
not
a
word
but
bent
forward
we
scan
the
horizon
with
piercing
eyes
as
though
we
would
penetrate
the
mountains
themselves
so
eager
are
we
to
see
the
city
i
hail
a
passing
boy
el
kuds
is
jerusalem
but
with
a
stupid
stare
he
passes
on
a
few
moments
more
the
house
is
reached
and
sion
royal
city
of
david
lies
before
us
waiting
until
the
rest
of
the
party
ride
up
we
dismount
kneel
kiss
the
ground
and
then
recite
aloud
the
psalm
a
pater
noster
and
an
ave
maria
remount
enter
the
city
by
the
jaffa
gate
ride
to
our
comfortable
quarters
at
the
latin
hospice
and
in
at
the
convent
we
were
entertained
in
the
most
hospitable
manner
and
provided
with
the
neatest
and
tidiest
of
rooms
early
the
next
morning
father
h
and
i
sallied
forth
to
call
on
père
ratisbonne
following
the
via
sacra
we
stopped
before
an
iron
gate
a
short
distance
below
the
arch
ecce
homo
and
little
achmud
picking
up
a
large
stone
pounded
upon
it
as
though
he
were
repaying
a
grudge
which
he
had
cherished
against
it
for
centuries
i
ventured
to
remonstrate
suggesting
that
they
might
be
displeased
at
so
much
noise
being
made
but
he
answered
very
coolly
meanwhile
continuing
the
pounding
as
if
his
future
happiness
depended
upon
making
a
hole
in
the
door
that
he
wanted
to
inform
those
inside
that
some
visitors
wished
to
call
upon
them
i
said
nothing
but
doubted
seriously
whether
that
would
be
the
impression
produced
on
their
minds
had
it
been
in
america
and
had
i
been
inside
i
should
have
imagined
that
it
was
an
election
row
or
a
fire
during
the
reign
of
the
volunteer
fire
department
but
notwithstanding
all
this
no
one
appeared
and
we
moved
away
disgusted
only
to
find
that
we
had
been
at
the
wrong
place
and
to
be
farther
informed
that
père
ratisbonne
was
in
paris
what
shall
i
say
of
the
sacred
spots
of
jerusalem
which
so
many
abler
pens
than
mine
have
attempted
to
describe
vainly
endeavoring
to
portray
the
inexpressible
emotions
that
crowd
the
breast
of
every
christian
as
he
kneels
before
them
for
the
first
time
perhaps
i
can
convey
to
my
readers
some
idea
of
the
feeling
which
continually
pervaded
my
whole
being
it
was
as
if
the
curtain
of
the
past
had
been
rolled
back
placing
me
face
to
face
with
the
living
actors
in
that
great
tragedy
of
our
redemption
eighteen
hundred
years
ago
what
contributed
in
a
great
measure
to
this
was
that
we
had
lived
during
the
winter
in
an
atmosphere
of
three
or
four
thousand
years
ago
we
had
scarcely
esteemed
it
worth
while
to
look
at
the
ruins
of
the
ptolemys
they
seemed
so
recent
after
the
massive
temples
of
the
rameses
and
the
ositarsens
and
now
the
beginning
of
the
christian
era
appeared
but
an
affair
of
yesterday
the
adamic
and
mosaic
dispensations
seemed
a
little
old
true
but
the
christian
dispensation
was
yet
to
us
in
all
the
glory
of
its
early
morn
i
felt
as
i
crossed
the
kedron
and
read
the
holy
gospels
seated
beneath
the
in
the
garden
of
gethsemane
as
if
even
i
had
been
a
personal
follower
of
the
and
in
imagination
could
hear
the
hosannas
of
praise
as
he
rode
past
me
on
the
ass
on
the
way
from
bethany
before
this
religion
had
seemed
to
me
more
like
an
intellectual
idea
now
i
felt
that
i
knew
him
as
a
friend
and
my
heart
beat
earnest
acquiescence
to
father
h
remark
from
egypt
christ
appears
a
modern
personage
and
the
visit
to
the
sacred
places
of
palestine
adds
to
the
intellectual
and
moral
conviction
of
the
truth
of
christianity
the
feeling
and
strength
of
personal
friendship
with
its
on
sunday
father
h
celebrated
mass
at
the
altar
erected
on
the
spot
where
the
blessed
virgin
stood
during
the
crucifixion
the
hole
in
the
rock
wherein
the
sacred
cross
was
planted
belongs
to
the
greeks
and
over
it
they
have
erected
an
altar
loaded
down
like
all
their
other
altars
with
tawdry
finery
on
another
occasion
i
had
the
happiness
to
serve
father
h
mass
on
the
spot
where
our
lord
was
nailed
to
the
cross
but
the
greatest
happiness
of
all
was
reserved
for
the
morning
we
left
the
holy
city
when
madame
and
i
received
holy
communion
from
the
hands
of
father
h
who
celebrated
mass
which
i
served
in
the
holy
sepulchre
itself
jesus
christus
sepultus
in
that
little
tomb
the
three
of
us
who
had
shared
together
the
pleasures
and
dangers
of
a
long
voyage
in
egypt
and
nubia
here
on
the
very
spot
where
he
was
entombed
we
alone
in
early
morn
received
his
sacred
body
and
blood
giving
fresh
life
and
courage
to
our
souls
for
our
future
struggles
with
the
world
how
much
better
instead
of
incrusting
the
sepulchre
with
marble
and
gems
to
have
left
it
as
it
was
rude
and
simple
as
when
the
was
laid
in
it
but
one
sacred
spot
is
left
in
its
primitive
state
the
grotto
of
the
agony
a
simple
altar
has
been
erected
in
it
and
a
marble
tablet
let
into
the
wall
with
this
inscription
upon
it
factus
est
sudor
ejus
sicut
guttæ
sanguinis
decurrentis
in
the
walls
and
roof
of
the
grotto
are
as
they
were
that
terrible
night
when
they
witnessed
the
sweat
as
drops
of
blood
rolling
down
his
sacred
face
the
limits
of
this
article
will
not
permit
me
to
tell
how
we
wandered
reverentially
along
the
via
sacra
or
gazed
in
admiration
from
summit
on
jerusalem
the
golden
lying
at
our
feet
of
our
interesting
visit
to
the
residence
of
the
princesse
de
la
tour
on
the
spot
where
the
apostles
were
taught
the
prayer
which
she
has
inscribed
on
the
walls
in
every
written
language
i
could
tell
of
our
visit
to
the
to
the
temple
the
tomb
of
the
blessed
virgin
our
walks
through
the
valley
of
jehoshaphat
but
these
descriptions
are
so
familiar
to
every
christian
that
i
will
content
myself
with
relating
more
of
the
personal
incidents
which
befell
us
than
general
descriptions
of
what
we
saw
father
h
and
i
left
jerusalem
on
tuesday
morning
and
after
riding
several
hours
camped
for
the
night
near
the
greek
convent
of
mars
saba
no
woman
is
allowed
to
enter
this
convent
and
men
only
with
permission
of
the
greek
patriarch
of
jerusalem
we
visited
the
tomb
of
saba
model
of
anchorites
and
saw
in
one
room
the
skulls
of
fourteen
thousand
of
his
brethren
most
of
them
massacred
by
the
bedouins
rev
mr
chambers
of
new
york
with
two
young
friends
was
encamped
near
us
and
we
spent
a
very
pleasant
evening
in
their
tent
at
five
the
next
morning
we
were
in
the
saddle
for
the
dead
sea
we
had
a
bedouin
escort
who
was
attired
in
a
dilapidated
soiled
and
was
scarcely
ever
with
us
either
taking
short
cuts
down
the
as
he
was
on
foot
and
getting
far
in
advance
of
us
or
lagging
equally
as
far
in
the
rear
nevertheless
it
was
a
powerful
escort
had
we
not
paid
the
sheik
of
the
tribe
five
dollars
for
it
and
did
it
not
represent
the
force
and
power
of
a
mighty
tribe
of
bedouins
in
sober
earnest
this
hatless
shoeless
escort
was
a
real
protection
for
if
we
had
been
attacked
while
he
was
with
us
his
tribe
or
the
sheik
of
it
would
have
been
forced
by
the
authorities
to
make
good
our
loss
and
moreover
the
attacking
tribe
would
have
incurred
the
enmity
of
our
tribe
a
very
serious
thing
in
this
part
of
the
world
and
among
men
whose
belief
is
whoso
sheddeth
blood
by
man
shall
his
blood
be
shed
the
bedouins
find
this
way
of
robbing
travellers
more
profitable
than
the
system
of
taking
their
property
et
for
in
the
latter
instance
they
are
liable
to
be
pursued
caught
and
punished
while
in
the
former
by
exacting
a
fee
from
the
traveller
and
furnishing
an
escort
in
return
they
make
considerable
money
without
fear
of
punishment
while
riding
along
toward
the
dead
sea
i
frequently
dismounted
to
shoot
partridges
and
on
remounting
i
took
out
the
cartridges
which
had
not
been
used
before
handing
my
gun
to
the
escort
who
carried
it
for
me
on
one
occasion
when
near
the
dead
sea
i
had
pursued
several
partridges
but
did
not
get
a
shot
at
them
and
returning
to
my
horse
held
by
the
escort
i
was
about
to
draw
out
the
cartridges
when
he
requested
me
to
let
them
remain
so
that
i
should
not
have
the
trouble
of
reloading
for
the
next
shot
i
shook
my
head
with
a
negative
motion
when
he
replied
in
an
humble
tone
well
i
am
a
bedouin
and
of
course
you
can
not
trust
and
then
flashed
across
my
mind
that
terrible
curse
pronounced
upon
ishmael
and
his
descendants
hand
shall
be
against
every
man
and
every
against
feeling
sorry
for
the
poor
fellow
i
looked
him
straight
in
the
eye
as
though
expressing
my
confidence
in
him
and
handed
him
the
loaded
gun
i
was
alone
with
him
now
as
the
rest
of
the
party
had
ridden
on
a
mile
or
two
in
advance
but
i
felt
perfectly
safe
because
he
was
walking
ahead
of
me
and
had
he
meditated
treachery
i
had
my
revolver
in
my
belt
and
could
have
killed
him
before
he
could
raise
the
gun
to
shoot
however
i
presume
that
he
simply
wanted
to
play
sportsman
himself
for
when
he
returned
me
the
gun
some
hours
afterwards
both
barrels
were
empty
about
ten
we
reached
the
barren
shores
of
the
dead
sea
passing
very
close
to
it
numberless
heaps
of
cinders
indicating
a
recent
bedouin
encampment
we
took
a
long
bath
in
these
buoyant
waters
i
sank
as
far
as
my
neck
and
then
walked
through
the
water
as
though
on
land
i
remained
nearly
an
hour
in
the
water
without
touching
the
bottom
it
is
very
difficult
to
swim
as
when
one
assumes
the
swimming
position
the
legs
are
thrown
half
out
of
the
water
these
waters
covering
the
site
of
sodom
and
gomorrha
are
clear
as
crystal
yet
to
the
taste
are
bitter
as
gall
riding
along
the
plain
for
a
short
hour
we
entered
the
luxurious
vegetation
on
the
banks
of
the
jordan
and
dismounted
near
the
place
where
john
baptized
our
lord
muddy
turbulent
jordan
shall
i
ever
forget
thee
or
the
pleasant
swim
i
had
in
thy
sweet
waters
father
h
and
i
dozed
for
about
an
hour
took
a
lunch
and
then
remounting
rode
across
the
level
plain
of
jericho
and
about
five
reached
our
tent
pitched
on
the
site
of
ancient
jericho
at
the
foot
of
the
mount
of
temptation
where
satan
would
tempt
our
lord
with
the
vain
fruitless
riches
of
this
world
after
dinner
we
walked
a
short
distance
and
sat
down
on
the
limb
of
a
tree
overhanging
the
sweet
waters
of
the
fountain
of
elisha
surrounded
by
armed
bedouins
who
watched
our
every
motion
with
eager
curiosity
and
occasionally
in
plaintive
tones
requested
we
passed
a
delightful
hour
recalling
the
sacred
reminiscences
connected
with
the
spots
around
us
behind
us
a
crumbling
ruin
marks
the
site
of
once
proud
jericho
the
city
to
which
the
warlike
joshua
sent
the
spies
from
the
moabitish
hills
beyond
the
jordan
the
city
destroyed
by
the
israelitish
and
against
which
the
terrible
curse
was
pronounced
be
the
man
before
the
lord
that
riseth
up
and
buildeth
this
city
jericho
he
shall
lay
the
foundation
thereof
in
his
and
in
his
youngest
son
he
shall
set
up
the
gates
of
a
curse
which
was
most
fearfully
fulfilled
yonder
elijah
went
up
to
heaven
in
a
whirlwind
far
away
in
the
distance
the
dead
sea
hemmed
in
by
its
mountain
banks
lies
calm
and
placid
in
the
dying
sunset
at
our
feet
is
the
broad
plain
of
jericho
and
at
our
back
the
mountains
of
judæa
how
singular
it
must
have
seemed
to
the
israelites
when
they
first
saw
mountains
covered
with
trees
and
verdure
in
their
old
egyptian
home
they
had
seen
but
the
vegetation
in
no
place
extending
beyond
the
level
ground
and
now
for
the
first
time
after
their
dreary
desert
wanderings
they
saw
the
vegetation
creeping
up
the
even
to
its
summit
and
thousands
of
sheep
browsing
upon
it
on
every
hand
early
the
next
morning
we
were
in
the
saddle
for
jerusalem
and
passing
the
spot
where
the
good
samaritan
ministered
to
the
poor
man
who
had
fallen
among
thieves
we
reached
bethany
about
noon
procuring
some
tapers
from
an
old
woman
we
descended
into
the
tomb
from
which
the
voice
of
his
god
had
called
forth
the
dead
lazarus
a
flight
of
steps
leads
down
some
distance
into
a
small
chamber
which
is
in
the
same
condition
as
when
brother
arising
from
the
dead
testified
to
the
assembled
crowd
the
power
of
jesus
of
nazareth
from
here
we
ascended
olivet
and
from
its
summit
looked
with
admiration
upon
the
beautiful
panorama
spread
out
beneath
us
and
lunched
under
the
venerable
which
perhaps
had
cast
their
shade
upon
the
weary
form
of
our
saviour
and
had
witnessed
the
glorious
miracle
of
his
ascension
soon
after
we
reached
our
convent
home
the
jews
in
the
holy
city
are
much
fairer
than
their
brethren
in
america
they
wear
the
gabardine
belted
at
the
waist
and
extending
to
the
ankles
on
the
head
a
high
black
felt
hat
with
broad
brim
while
two
curls
hang
down
the
cheek
on
either
side
they
are
a
race
fascinating
to
gaze
upon
as
connected
with
the
great
drama
yet
inspiring
me
at
the
same
time
with
a
feeling
of
disgust
which
i
could
not
control
how
striking
a
picture
of
their
degradation
and
fall
from
their
once
proud
estate
as
the
chosen
ones
of
god
is
shown
as
they
gather
on
fridays
to
their
five
courses
of
large
bevelled
stones
being
all
that
remain
of
grand
temple
here
are
jews
of
all
ages
and
of
both
sexes
crying
bitterly
over
fallen
jerusalem
old
men
tottering
up
bury
their
faces
in
the
joints
and
cavities
and
weep
aloud
as
though
their
hearts
were
breaking
while
in
chorus
comes
the
low
plaintive
wail
of
the
women
in
and
among
and
around
and
about
them
with
shouts
of
mirth
and
laughter
play
the
children
of
the
arab
conquerors
the
jews
are
permitted
to
weep
here
unmolested
on
sunday
afternoon
accompanied
by
father
guido
we
went
to
bethlehem
we
passed
the
night
in
the
latin
convent
and
the
next
morning
madame
and
i
received
holy
communion
from
the
hands
of
father
h
who
celebrated
mass
in
the
crib
of
the
nativity
on
the
spot
where
the
wise
men
stood
when
adoring
the
babe
the
very
spot
where
christ
was
born
is
marked
by
a
silver
star
with
this
inscription
upon
it
de
virgine
maria
jesus
christus
natus
the
star
belongs
to
the
latins
but
the
altar
over
it
to
the
greeks
who
have
several
times
attempted
to
carry
off
the
star
but
unsuccessfully
they
of
course
will
not
permit
the
latins
to
celebrate
mass
upon
the
altar
the
greeks
being
more
powerful
are
continually
harassing
and
heaping
all
sorts
of
indignities
upon
the
latins
who
are
obliged
to
submit
to
them
shame
upon
the
catholic
nations
of
europe
nations
which
in
bygone
times
sent
forth
those
noble
bands
of
crusaders
sacrificing
their
lives
to
rescue
the
holy
places
from
infidel
hands
but
easter
a
year
ago
they
destroyed
the
valuable
hangings
in
the
holy
crib
presented
to
the
latins
by
the
french
government
and
stole
two
pictures
from
their
altars
valued
at
six
thousand
dollars
apiece
nay
more
than
this
they
even
severely
wounded
with
a
sword
the
franciscan
brother
who
endeavored
to
prevent
the
execution
of
their
nefarious
designs
and
again
the
past
easter
but
a
few
days
before
we
were
there
witnessed
another
of
these
terrible
scenes
of
barbarism
and
inhumanity
a
number
of
unoffending
pilgrims
just
returned
from
their
annual
easter
visit
to
the
jordan
were
denied
entrance
by
the
greeks
to
the
basilica
over
the
holy
crib
and
when
they
insisted
upon
entering
the
church
which
is
common
property
and
in
which
they
had
a
perfect
right
to
go
and
attempted
to
force
their
way
in
they
were
arrested
by
the
turkish
governor
of
bethlehem
who
is
in
league
with
the
greeks
under
the
pretext
that
they
were
inciting
to
riot
and
cast
into
a
loathsome
dungeon
in
jerusalem
but
thanks
to
the
exertions
of
de
lesseps
they
were
subsequently
released
i
rode
over
to
the
hill
where
the
shepherds
watched
their
flocks
that
eventful
night
when
the
angels
announced
to
them
the
tidings
of
great
in
the
afternoon
we
rode
across
the
mountains
to
the
of
john
the
baptist
the
women
in
this
part
of
the
country
but
particularly
in
bethlehem
and
its
vicinity
carry
all
their
fortunes
on
their
heads
dressed
in
the
picturesque
garb
of
the
moabitish
women
their
coins
are
hung
in
great
numbers
from
their
caps
one
young
mother
with
her
babe
in
her
arms
and
with
her
cap
almost
covered
with
rows
of
gold
coins
approached
me
at
and
begged
me
in
a
piteous
tone
for
a
copper
and
appeared
delighted
when
i
gave
it
to
her
they
would
almost
sooner
starve
than
part
with
these
coins
in
which
they
take
great
pride
but
i
imagine
that
after
they
are
married
their
husbands
find
means
of
obtaining
possession
of
them
and
then
they
get
into
general
circulation
again
we
went
to
see
the
scene
of
the
visitation
over
which
an
altar
had
been
erected
in
the
early
ages
of
christianity
but
which
had
been
concealed
for
centuries
and
only
accidentally
discovered
of
late
by
the
latins
in
renovating
their
church
alongside
the
altar
is
the
impression
of
a
baby
in
the
rock
it
is
said
that
when
soldiers
came
to
the
house
of
elizabeth
to
execute
their
murderous
commands
to
massacre
the
little
innocents
the
saintly
mother
pressed
her
infant
against
the
wall
which
opened
received
him
and
then
closing
again
hid
him
from
view
and
thus
was
he
saved
to
grow
up
a
voice
crying
in
the
wilderness
straight
the
way
of
the
we
spent
the
night
in
the
convent
built
on
the
site
of
the
house
where
was
born
this
of
the
next
day
we
returned
to
jerusalem
visiting
the
greek
church
on
the
spot
where
grew
the
tree
from
which
the
sacred
cross
was
made
shortly
after
this
we
left
the
holy
city
soon
bade
farewell
to
our
trusty
dragoman
and
embarked
on
the
at
jaffa
bound
for
marseilles
oh
what
impressions
were
made
upon
me
by
my
short
sojourn
among
those
sacred
places
how
my
faith
was
strengthened
and
my
love
and
devotion
increased
and
how
earnestly
and
often
i
wished
and
still
wish
that
each
and
every
one
i
know
could
see
what
i
have
seen
and
feel
as
i
now
feel
a
christmas
vigil
aim
there
is
of
endless
worth
one
love
to
do
thy
will
o
god
on
earth
and
reign
with
thee
above
from
joys
that
failed
my
soul
to
fill
from
hopes
that
all
beguiled
to
changeless
rest
in
thy
dear
will
o
jesus
call
thy
exeter
beach
was
divided
into
two
distinct
parts
by
a
line
of
cliff
jutting
far
out
into
exeter
bay
below
the
eastern
face
of
the
cliff
lay
the
moore
estate
and
then
came
the
town
but
on
the
west
side
was
an
inlet
backed
by
dense
woods
and
bounded
on
the
farther
extremity
by
another
wall
of
rock
this
was
known
as
lonely
cove
and
deserved
its
title
from
it
one
looked
straight
out
to
the
open
sea
no
island
intervened
nor
was
anything
visible
on
shore
save
the
two
long
arms
of
frowning
rock
the
circuit
of
pine
coming
close
to
the
edge
of
that
marked
the
limit
of
the
tide
and
at
the
far
distance
a
solitary
house
this
had
once
been
occupied
by
a
man
who
made
himself
a
home
apart
from
every
one
and
died
as
lonely
as
he
lived
since
then
it
had
been
deserted
and
was
crumbling
to
decay
and
many
believed
it
to
be
haunted
along
this
beach
about
three
one
christmas
eve
jane
moore
was
walking
it
was
a
dull
afternoon
with
a
lowering
sky
and
a
chill
in
the
air
which
foreboded
rain
rather
than
snow
but
wrapped
in
her
velvet
cloak
and
furs
of
costly
sable
jane
did
not
heed
the
weather
her
heart
was
full
to
overflowing
from
the
first
christmas
that
she
could
remember
to
the
one
previous
to
his
death
she
had
taken
that
walk
with
her
father
every
christmas
eve
while
he
talked
with
her
of
the
joy
of
the
coming
day
sang
to
her
old
christmas
carols
and
sought
to
prepare
her
for
a
holy
as
well
as
a
merry
feast
he
had
tried
to
be
father
and
mother
both
to
his
motherless
girl
but
his
heart
ached
as
he
watched
her
imperious
nature
often
only
to
be
curbed
by
her
extreme
love
for
him
patient
my
friend
the
old
priest
who
knew
his
solicitude
used
to
say
is
a
very
noble
nature
through
much
suffering
and
failure
it
may
be
but
nevertheless
our
jane
will
live
a
grand
life
yet
for
the
love
of
and
so
james
moore
strove
to
believe
and
hope
till
death
closed
his
eyes
when
his
daughter
was
only
thirteen
years
old
heiress
of
enormous
wealth
and
of
a
beauty
which
had
been
famous
in
that
county
for
six
generations
loving
keenly
all
that
was
fair
luxurious
and
intellectual
jane
moore
was
one
of
the
most
brilliant
women
of
her
day
dancing
and
riding
conversation
and
music
she
threw
herself
into
each
pursuit
by
turn
with
the
same
which
had
ever
characterized
her
yet
the
priest
who
had
baptized
her
and
who
gave
her
special
prayerful
care
and
direction
laid
seemingly
little
check
upon
her
such
religious
duties
as
were
given
her
she
performed
faithfully
she
never
missed
the
daily
mass
or
monthly
confession
not
a
poor
cottage
in
the
village
in
which
she
was
not
known
and
loved
though
as
yet
she
only
came
with
smiles
and
money
and
cheery
words
instead
of
personal
tendance
and
real
no
ball
shortened
her
prayers
no
sport
hindered
her
brief
daily
meditation
the
priest
knew
that
beyond
all
other
desires
that
soul
sought
the
lord
beyond
all
other
loves
loved
him
and
that
she
strove
though
poorly
and
imperfectly
and
with
daily
failure
to
subject
her
will
to
the
higher
will
of
god
to
have
drawn
the
curb
too
tightly
then
might
have
been
to
ruin
all
the
wise
priest
waited
and
while
he
waited
he
prayed
this
christmas
eve
on
which
jane
moore
was
speeding
along
the
beach
was
the
last
she
would
ever
spend
as
a
merry
girl
in
her
old
home
as
a
wife
as
a
mother
she
might
come
there
again
but
with
epiphany
her
days
must
end
her
heart
once
given
had
been
given
wholly
and
henry
everett
was
worthy
of
the
gift
but
the
breaking
of
old
ties
told
sorely
upon
jane
who
always
made
her
burdens
heavier
than
need
be
by
her
constant
endeavor
to
gain
her
own
will
and
way
her
handsome
face
looked
dark
and
sallow
that
afternoon
the
thin
quivering
nostrils
and
compressed
lips
told
of
a
storm
in
her
heart
can
not
understand
it
she
said
aloud
must
i
go
away
surely
it
was
right
to
wish
to
live
always
in
my
old
home
among
my
people
should
god
let
father
live
and
live
and
live
to
be
ninety
years
old
and
he
be
mean
and
troublesome
and
should
my
dear
father
die
young
when
i
needed
him
i
can
not
bear
to
go
and
then
came
to
her
mind
words
said
to
her
that
very
day
few
words
but
strong
out
of
a
wise
and
loving
heart
asks
something
from
you
this
christmas
in
the
midst
of
your
joy
which
i
believe
he
will
ask
from
you
in
joy
or
sorrow
all
your
life
long
until
he
gets
it
he
wants
the
entire
surrender
of
your
will
i
do
not
know
how
he
will
do
it
but
i
am
sure
he
will
never
let
you
alone
till
he
has
gained
his
end
make
it
your
christmas
prayer
that
he
will
teach
you
that
his
will
is
better
and
sweeter
than
anything
our
wills
may
she
flew
faster
along
the
beach
striving
by
the
very
motion
to
find
relief
for
the
swelling
of
her
heart
can
not
bear
it
she
cried
have
always
to
do
something
i
do
not
want
to
do
i
can
not
bear
it
yes
i
can
and
i
will
god
help
me
but
i
can
not
on
on
faster
still
sobs
choking
her
tears
blinding
her
wanted
so
much
to
live
and
die
here
god
must
have
known
it
and
what
difference
could
it
make
to
him
ye
ye
tom
no
right
ye
for
the
words
in
a
shrill
voice
as
of
one
weak
with
fasting
or
illness
yet
strong
for
the
instant
with
the
strength
of
a
great
fear
or
pain
broke
in
upon
passion
and
coming
to
herself
she
found
that
she
was
close
to
the
haunted
house
fear
was
unknown
to
her
in
an
instant
she
stood
within
the
room
evidently
some
tramp
poorer
than
the
poorest
had
sought
shelter
little
better
than
none
alas
in
the
wretched
place
a
haggard
woman
was
crouching
on
a
pile
of
and
holding
tightly
to
something
hidden
in
the
ragged
clothing
huddled
about
her
striving
to
keep
it
whatever
it
might
be
from
the
grasp
of
a
desperate
man
who
bent
over
her
it
to
me
he
cried
tell
ye
poll
have
it
that
i
wull
for
all
ye
and
trample
it
and
burn

that

where
i
bes

and
have
my
own

man
jane
stood
close
beside
him
with
flashing
eyes
and
her
proud
and
fearless
face
me
the
crucifix
she
said
but
she
met
eyes
as
fearless
as
her
own
which
scanned
her
from
head
to
foot
who
be
you
he
asked
moore
she
answered
with
the
ring
that
was
always
in
her
voice
when
she
named
her
honored
name
that
to
me
the
man
exclaimed
names
to
save
and
he
shook
the
crucifix
defiantly
stop
jane
cried
will
pay
you
well
to
then
miss
god
died
on
a
cross
jane
answered
shall
not
harm
his
for
yourself
miss
shall
not
my
as
strong
as
yours
warrant
god
no
god
else
why
be
ye
in
velvets
and
her
in
rags
why
i
trample
this
in
another
moment
the
crucifix
would
have
lain
beneath
his
heel
but
jane
flung
herself
on
her
knees
all
pride
was
gone
tears
rained
from
her
eyes
she
who
had
been
used
to
command
and
to
be
obeyed
pleaded
like
a
beggar
with
humble
yet
passionate
pleading
at
the
feet
of
this
beggar
and
outcast
wait
she
cried
hear
me
truly
your
god
was
born
in
a
stable
and
died
upon
a
cross
he
loves
you
and
he
was
as
poor
as
be
no
god
the
man
reiterated
hoarsely
easy
for
the
likes
ye
to
talk
all
warm
and
full
and
jane
wrung
her
hands
can
not
explain
she
said
can
not
understand
but
it
must
be
that
god
knows
best
he
sent
me
come
home
with
me
and
i
will
give
you
food
and
clothes
and
i
cried
the
man
defiantly
knows
that
trick
too
well
miss
food
and
clothes
belike
but
a
jail
too
trust
none
pay
me
jane
turned
her
pocket
out
have
nothing
with
me
she
said
you
not
trust
me
but
in
his
face
she
read
her
answer
while
she
spoke
well
she
continued
a
note
from
me
to
my
steward
he
will
pay
was
the
brief
reply
hastily
she
wrote
a
few
words
in
pencil
and
he
read
them
aloud
miss
he
said
not
safe
for
me
to
be
about
town
much
dark
and
more
i
trust
ye
there
neither
here
bide
the
night
through
if
ye
means
what
ye
tom
the
woman
exclaimed
breaking
silence
for
the
first
time
since
jane
spoke
be
a
fearful
night
for
the
like
her
feel
it
then
he
retorted
her
lord
she
talks
on
born
in
the
cold
and
the
gloom
to
you
and
she
lass
let
her
say
i
and
see
what
believe
come
like
a
flash
it
passed
through
mind
that
her
last
midnight
mass
among
her
own
people
was
taken
from
her
that
knowing
her
uncertain
ways
no
one
would
think
of
seeking
her
till
it
was
too
late
any
more
than
her
steward
well
used
to
her
impulses
would
dream
of
questioning
a
note
of
hers
no
matter
who
brought
it
yet
with
the
keen
pang
of
disappointment
a
thrill
of
sweetness
mingled
was
not
her
lord
indeed
born
in
the
cold
and
the
gloom
that
night
am
quite
willing
to
wait
she
said
quietly
the
man
went
to
the
door
nigh
full
he
said
nigh
here
go
my
ways
but
mark
ye
miss
be
waiting
side
to
see
ye
follow
trust
me
to
wait
patient
till
too
dark
for
ye
to
jane
watched
him
till
he
had
reached
the
further
line
of
the
cliff
then
she
buried
her
face
in
her
hands
space
and
time
seemed
as
nothing
again
as
for
years
she
had
been
used
to
do
she
strove
to
place
herself
in
the
stable
at
bethlehem
and
the
rose
within
her
to
clasp
the
holy
infant
in
her
arms
and
warm
him
at
her
heart
and
clothe
him
like
a
prince
and
then
she
remembered
what
the
man
had
said
easy
for
the
likes
ye
to
talk
all
warm
and
full
and
there
are
natures
still
among
us
that
can
not
be
content
unless
they
lavish
the
whole
box
of
ointment
on
the
feet
jane
turned
to
the
heap
of
where
the
woman
lay
you
rise
for
a
minute
she
asked
gently
am
going
to
change
clothes
with
you
yes
i
am
strong
and
can
walk
about
and
bear
it
all
but
you
will
freeze
if
you
lie
and
putting
down
the
feeble
resistance
with
a
bright
sweet
will
jane
had
her
way
half
exhausted
her
companion
sank
back
upon
her
poor
couch
and
soon
fell
asleep
and
when
the
baby
woke
jane
took
it
from
her
lest
its
pitiful
wailing
should
rouse
the
mother
to
whom
had
come
blessed
forgetfulness
of
her
utter
inability
to
feed
or
soothe
it
she
wrapped
the
child
in
her
rags
and
walked
the
room
with
it
for
hours
that
night
it
seemed
to
her
that
they
must
freeze
to
death
if
she
stopped
for
a
time
the
wind
raged
furiously
and
the
rain
fell
in
torrents
no
blessed
vision
came
to
dispel
the
darkness
of
her
vigil
no
ecstasy
to
keep
the
cold
from
biting
her
she
felt
its
sting
sharply
and
painfully
the
whole
night
through
the
first
few
hours
were
the
hardest
she
had
ever
spent
yet
she
would
not
have
exchanged
them
for
the
sweetest
joy
this
world
had
ever
given
her
lord
was
cold
she
kept
saying
lord
was
cold
by
and
by
it
seemed
to
her
that
it
must
be
very
late
the
storm
passed
over
she
went
to
the
door
the
clouds
were
lifting
and
far
away
the
sea
was
glimmering
faintly
in
the
last
rays
of
a
hidden
and
setting
moon
below
a
mass
of
dark
clouds
and
just
above
the
sea
shone
out
a
large
white
star
across
the
water
heaving
heavily
like
one
who
has
fallen
asleep
after
violent
weeping
and
still
sobs
in
slumber
came
to
her
the
sound
of
the
clock
striking
midnight
and
then
all
the
chimes
rang
sweetly
and
she
knew
that
the
mass
she
had
longed
for
had
begun
can
not
bear
it
she
cried
then
felt
the
child
stir
on
her
breast
and
gathering
it
closer
to
her
she
said
slowly
understands
his
way
must
be
and
she
tried
to
join
in
spirit
with
those
in
church
who
greeted
the
coming
of
the
lord
surely
there
was
some
reason
for
her
great
disappointment
and
for
her
suffering
that
night
reason
was
it
not
enough
to
be
permitted
thus
to
share
his
first
night
of
deprivation
and
presently
she
began
to
plan
for
herself
plan
how
the
man
would
return
and
find
her
there
wet
and
cold
and
hungry
and
would
learn
why
she
had
done
it
and
would
never
doubt
god
again
she
fancied
them
all
at
home
with
her
employed
by
her
brought
back
to
a
happy
holy
life
and
she
prayed
long
and
earnestly
for
each
he
did
come
as
soon
as
the
gray
morning
twilight
broke
came
with
haste
bade
his
wife
rise
and
take
her
child
and
follow
him
he
gave
no
time
for
the
words
jane
wished
to
speak
but
when
the
woman
said
that
she
must
return
the
garments
which
had
kept
her
warm
and
perhaps
alive
that
night
jane
cried
no
it
is
as
if
i
had
kept
our
lady
warm
for
once
and
carried
her
child
not
and
she
clasped
the
baby
passionately
kissing
it
again
and
again
the
man
stood
doubtful
then
tore
the
rich
cloak
from
his
shoulders
seized
the
mean
one
which
it
had
replaced
wrapped
her
in
it
hiding
thus
the
costly
attire
that
might
have
caused
suspicion
then
looked
about
the
room
crucifix
he
said
it
not
mine
jane
asked
he
pointed
to
the
woman
her
bit
comfort
he
said
it
to
her
miss
plenty
got
i
wot
harm
there
was
no
more
farewell
than
that
no
more
promise
of
better
things
in
a
few
minutes
they
had
disappeared
among
the
pines
and
cold
suffering
disheartened
jane
made
her
way
homeward
to
her
truest
home
first
for
bells
were
ringing
for
first
mass
and
jane
stole
into
church
and
clad
in
rags
beneath
her
velvet
cloak
knelt
in
real
humility
to
receive
her
lord
do
not
understand
she
said
to
him
sobbing
softly
that
i
do
succeeds
as
i
like
but
my
jesus
i
am
sure
thy
will
is
best
only
i
wanted
so
much
to
help
them
for
thee
why
was
it
my
jesus
but
the
years
went
by
and
though
christmas
after
christmas
jane
remembered
with
a
pang
that
great
disappointment
her
longings
and
her
questions
remained
unanswered
and
so
it
was
in
almost
everything
her
life
after
that
strange
christmas
eve
was
one
of
constant
heroic
personal
service
for
others
in
the
love
of
the
sacred
heart
of
jesus
the
brilliant
woman
was
never
seen
again
at
ball
or
hunt
but
beside
the
beds
of
the
sick
and
suffering
she
was
daily
to
be
found
making
the
most
painful
repulsive
cases
her
special
care
and
she
who
had
delighted
in
daintiest
apparel
never
wore
again
after
that
christmas
morning
jewels
or
costly
clothing
have
tasted
once
the
sweetness
of
faring
like
my
lord
she
said
impetuously
to
her
husband
not
break
my
heart
by
making
me
all
warm
and
full
and
comfortable
and
he
whose
high
soul
answered
nobly
to
her
own
never
tried
to
hold
her
back
but
followed
her
eagerly
in
her
earnest
following
of
her
lord
yet
the
nature
cost
its
owner
many
sufferings
before
it
learned
submission
to
the
divine
master
it
pleased
god
that
jane
everett
should
live
to
an
advanced
and
very
strong
old
age
and
it
also
pleased
him
through
all
those
years
to
conform
her
will
to
his
by
constant
and
peculiar
trials
the
husband
whom
she
loved
with
an
almost
idolatrous
love
was
taken
from
her
without
an
warning
by
a
fearful
accident
her
sons
whom
she
dedicated
to
holy
priesthood
died
in
their
cradles
her
daughters
grew
into
the
fairest
bloom
of
womanhood
only
to
become
the
brides
of
death
yet
nothing
quenched
the
fire
in
her
eye
and
the
cry
of
her
heart
for
years
was
still
its
old
cry
god
i
can
not
bear
it
yes
i
can
will
is
best
but
i
can
not
one
advent
the
last
remaining
friend
of
her
youth
sent
to
her
begging
her
to
come
with
haste
to
pass
with
her
the
last
christmas
they
could
expect
to
be
together
on
earth
and
the
brave
old
woman
though
craving
to
spend
the
holy
season
near
her
graves
went
forth
to
face
the
inclement
weather
with
as
stout
a
heart
as
in
her
youth
she
had
sped
along
exeter
beach
under
the
threatening
sky
in
a
little
village
with
no
one
near
who
knew
her
except
her
servants
death
laid
his
hand
upon
her
who
had
desired
him
for
many
days
is
a
serious
illness
the
physician
said
to
her
then
reading
rightly
the
spirit
with
which
he
had
to
deal
he
added
sickness
unto
death
the
horses
then
she
said
lifting
herself
let
me
get
to
ewemouth
and
die
for
a
priest
the
doctor
answered
her
have
no
time
to
has
been
always
so
father
jane
said
looking
up
pitifully
into
the
face
of
the
priest
when
at
last
he
came
the
time
that
i
first
earnestly
gave
myself
to
god
up
to
this
time
he
has
thwarted
me
in
every
way
sixty
years
ago
this
very
christmas
eve
he
did
it
it
all
comes
back
to
me
as
hard
to
bear
as
then
and
all
my
life
has
been
like
and
slowly
and
with
pauses
jane
told
the
story
of
her
night
at
lonely
cove
has
always
been
so
father
whenever
i
have
loved
any
one
or
tried
to
help
any
one
i
have
failed
or
they
have
left
daughter
the
priest
replied
work
in
a
life
like
yours
is
far
more
the
subjection
of
the
will
than
the
number
of
holy
actions
for
others
be
sure
that
what
we
think
failure
is
often
success
in
eyes
and
through
his
power
he
asks
one
last
sacrifice
from
you
madam
god
has
brought
you
here
to
add
the
crowning
blessing
to
your
life
the
opportunity
of
a
last
and
entire
surrender
of
your
will
to
his
most
blessed
will
will
you
offer
to
him
your
whole
life
that
to
you
seems
so
incomplete
and
marred
judged
by
your
own
plans
and
wishes
saying
to
him
without
reserve
that
you
believe
certainly
that
his
way
is
far
better
than
yours
he
held
the
crucifix
before
her
and
suddenly
the
long
years
seemed
to
vanish
like
a
dream
and
she
felt
once
more
the
biting
cold
in
the
haunted
house
at
lonely
cove
and
again
a
child
nestled
upon
her
heart
bringing
with
it
the
thought
of
the
and
the
question
should
so
much
suffering
be
and
from
that
manger
her
thoughts
returned
to
the
hard
couch
of
the
cross
and
to
all
that
mystery
of
suffering
came
the
mysterious
answer
my
will
but
thine
be
she
took
and
kissed
the
offered
crucifix
father
she
said
meekly
the
most
just
most
high
and
most
amiable
will
of
god
be
done
praised
and
eternally
exalted
in
all
things
i
had
rather
die
here
o
my
god
since
it
is
thy
blessed
will
than
in
any
other
place
on
said
the
priest
but
when
the
last
sacraments
had
been
administered
and
jane
lay
calm
and
patient
now
waiting
her
release
the
priest
drew
near
to
her
and
looked
with
a
great
reverence
upon
her
face
daughter
he
said
is
at
times
the
will
of
god
to
show
us
even
here
the
use
of
some
part
at
least
of
what
he
has
let
us
do
for
him
be
sure
his
sacred
heart
remembers
all
the
rest
as
well
sixty
years
ago
this
christmas
eve
my
father
was
saved
from
a
great
sin
my
mother
and
i
from
death
by
a
christian
love
for
her
lord
the
first
confession
i
ever
heard
was
my
own
last
he
told
me
that
from
the
time
he
saw
that
rich
young
girl
in
rags
endure
the
biting
cold
for
god
faith
lived
in
his
heart
and
not
i
saw
him
pass
away
from
earth
in
penitence
and
hope
for
more
than
thirty
years
i
have
labored
among
poor
as
your
madam
my
mother
by
the
love
of
god
god
sends
you
this
token
that
he
has
worked
his
own
work
by
means
of
you
all
your
life
long
he
sends
you
this
token
because
you
have
given
him
the
thing
he
most
desired
of
you
your
jane
folded
her
aged
hands
humbly
unto
us
o
lord
she
said
low
and
faint
and
then
a
voice
as
of
a
son
and
priest
at
once
spoke
clearly
seeing
her
time
had
come
o
christian
soul
in
the
apostolic
mission
to
chili
chapter
in
the
life
of
pius
before
entertaining
ourselves
with
an
account
of
the
voyage
and
journeys
from
genoa
to
buenos
ayres
and
across
the
continent
to
valparaiso
of
the
first
pope
who
has
ever
been
to
america
we
shall
enter
into
a
few
details
to
show
the
occasion
of
the
apostolic
mission
which
he
accompanied
in
an
official
capacity
the
great
reverses
of
spain
at
the
beginning
of
the
present
century
and
the
consequent
weakening
of
the
bonds
that
united
her
american
colonies
to
their
besides
some
other
causes
silently
working
since
the
emancipation
of
the
thirteen
british
provinces
from
england
finally
led
to
a
declaration
of
independence
which
was
established
after
several
years
of
war
but
the
king
to
whose
government
these
possessions
had
been
subject
for
nearly
three
hundred
years
refused
to
recognize
the
accomplished
fact
or
to
enter
into
diplomatic
relations
with
rebels
against
his
authority
the
congress
of
verona
in
took
some
notice
of
these
revolted
countries
but
the
european
powers
did
not
all
agree
to
receive
them
into
the
family
of
nations
by
a
formal
recognition
and
it
is
well
known
that
the
views
expressed
in
that
assembly
gave
rise
on
the
part
of
the
president
of
the
united
states
to
a
declaration
of
policy
which
has
been
called
the
monroe
doctrine
the
holy
see
having
sublimer
interests
to
deal
with
could
not
act
as
indifferently
in
this
matter
as
other
governments
which
looked
only
to
temporal
advantage
and
wrangled
over
old
systems
of
public
policy
regardless
of
recent
events
by
the
quixotic
obstinacy
of
spain
the
south
american
republics
suffered
much
inconvenience
particularly
in
point
of
religion
because
rome
could
not
provide
for
their
spiritual
wants
without
risking
an
open
rupture
with
his
catholic
majesty
such
were
royal
pretensions
of
restricting
the
exercise
of
papal
rights
even
in
merely
nominal
dominions
during
the
latter
part
of
pius
pontificate
the
government
of
chili
sent
one
of
its
distinguished
citizens
the
archdeacon
don
josé
cienfuegos
envoy
to
rome
with
instructions
to
try
to
establish
direct
ecclesiastical
relations
between
the
holy
see
and
santiago
the
capital
of
his
country
he
arrived
there
on
august
and
was
well
received
but
only
in
his
spiritual
capacity
the
pope
would
not
recognize
him
as
a
political
agent
on
the
of
september
following
the
holy
father
addressed
a
brief
to
the
bishop
of
merida
de
maracaybo
in
which
he
expressed
himself
solicitous
for
the
spiritual
necessities
of
his
children
in
those
parts
of
america
and
intimated
his
ardent
desire
to
relieve
them
a
little
later
he
formed
a
special
congregation
of
six
cardinals
presided
over
by
della
genga
who
became
his
successor
as
leo
xii
and
after
mature
deliberation
on
the
religious
affairs
in
the
of
spain
it
was
determined
to
send
a
mission
to
chili
that
country
being
chosen
for
the
honor
as
having
made
the
first
advances
this
measure
so
displeased
the
spanish
government
that
the
nuncio
monsignor
afterwards
cardinal
giustiniani
was
dismissed
and
although
he
was
soon
after
permitted
to
return
the
wound
inflicted
upon
him
left
its
sting
behind
for
coming
very
near
to
the
number
of
votes
requisite
to
election
in
the
conclave
after
pius
death
the
court
of
madrid
barred
his
fortune
by
the
exercise
of
that
odious
privilege
called
the
the
ground
of
his
exclusion
from
the
papacy
being
supposed
at
rome
to
have
been
his
participation
in
the
appointment
of
bishops
to
south
america
the
right
of
veto
expires
with
its
exercise
once
in
each
conclave
and
cardinal
cappellari
gregory
xvi
who
as
we
shall
see
had
the
most
to
do
with
these
episcopal
nominations
was
elected
pope
the
choice
of
a
for
the
chilian
mission
fell
upon
ostini
later
nuncio
to
brazil
and
a
cardinal
who
after
having
accepted
the
position
saw
fit
suddenly
to
decline
it
for
reasons
best
known
to
himself
in
his
stead
don
giovanni
muzi
then
attached
to
the
nunciature
at
vienna
was
selected
and
having
been
recalled
to
rome
was
consecrated
archbishop
of
philippi
in
with
orders
to
proceed
immediately
to
santiago
the
mission
of
which
we
shall
speak
more
particularly
hereafter
embarked
on
october
and
reached
rome
on
its
return
the
of
july
leo
xii
succeeded
pius
vii
in
the
republic
of
colombia
sent
don
ignacio
texada
to
rome
with
an
application
for
bishops
and
apostolic
vicars
in
that
immense
region
but
the
spanish
ambassador
chevalier
vargas
a
haughty
diplomate
brimful
of
went
to
the
pope
and
demanded
his
dismissal
this
was
refused
the
envoy
had
come
for
spiritual
interests
not
on
political
grounds
and
the
spaniard
could
not
convince
leo
that
the
argument
by
which
he
asked
no
more
than
that
species
of
indirect
recognition
granted
by
the
holy
see
under
innocent
and
alexander
to
the
house
of
braganza
when
it
forced
portugal
from
under
spanish
rule
was
not
a
good
one
and
founded
on
precedent
nevertheless
texada
returned
to
bologna
and
finally
withdrew
altogether
from
the
papal
states
he
had
some
fine
qualities
but
lacked
discretion
in
speech
which
was
a
fault
very
injurious
to
his
position
harpocrates
is
still
the
great
god
of
diplomacy
the
world
over
this
state
of
things
was
embarrassing
spain
had
refused
to
recognize
the
independence
of
her
many
provinces
in
the
new
world
although
she
had
ceased
practically
even
to
disturb
them
the
king
who
was
somewhat
of
a
de
claimed
all
his
old
rights
over
them
and
among
them
that
of
episcopal
presentation
cardinal
wiseman
who
was
an
attentive
observer
of
these
times
remarks
very
properly
we
think
that
even
if
such
a
power
could
be
still
called
legal
would
have
been
quite
unreasonable
to
expect
that
the
free
republics
would
acknowledge
the
jurisdiction
of
the
country
which
declared
itself
at
war
with
this
was
a
clear
case
in
which
allegiance
should
follow
protection
after
a
prudent
delay
leo
thought
it
his
duty
to
represent
energetically
to
the
spanish
government
the
inconvenience
he
suffered
from
the
existing
state
of
affairs
and
the
impossibility
of
his
viewing
with
indifference
a
condition
in
which
the
faithful
long
deprived
of
pastors
were
urgently
asking
for
bishops
for
the
vacant
sees
yet
his
holiness
had
taken
no
decisive
step
but
called
upon
his
majesty
either
to
reduce
his
transatlantic
subjects
to
obedience
or
to
leave
him
free
to
provide
as
best
he
could
for
the
necessities
of
the
church
in
the
consistory
of
may
the
pope
after
protesting
that
he
could
not
any
longer
in
conscience
delay
his
duty
to
spanish
america
proceeded
to
nominate
bishops
for
more
than
six
dioceses
in
those
parts
madrid
was
of
course
displeased
although
it
was
twelve
years
since
the
government
had
lost
even
the
shadow
of
authority
there
and
at
first
refused
to
receive
the
new
nuncio
tiberi
at
this
juncture
pedro
gomez
de
labrador
was
sent
from
spain
expressly
to
defeat
the
measure
but
although
by
all
parties
and
especially
by
the
diplomatic
body
in
rome
to
be
one
of
the
most
able
and
accomplished
statesmen
in
europe
yet
he
could
not
carry
his
against
the
quiet
and
cardinal
cappellari
who
was
deputed
by
the
pope
to
meet
him
in
the
allocution
pronounced
by
labbrador
before
the
sacred
college
assembled
in
conclave
to
elect
a
successor
to
leo
he
made
an
allusion
to
the
subject
of
the
revolted
americans
but
although
done
with
tact
it
grated
on
the
ears
of
many
as
too
persistently
and
under
the
circumstances
unreasonably
put
forward
the
discussion
between
the
courts
of
rome
and
madrid
was
not
renewed
during
the
brief
pontificate
of
pius
viii
but
in
the
encyclical
letter
announcing
his
election
there
is
a
delicate
reference
to
the
affair
which
although
not
expressly
named
will
be
perceived
by
those
who
are
acquainted
with
the
questions
of
that
day
comte
de
maistre
says
somewhere
that
if
a
parish
be
left
without
a
priest
for
thirty
years
the
people
will
worship
the
pigs
and
although
the
absence
of
a
bishop
from
his
diocese
for
such
a
length
of
time
might
not
induce
a
similar
result
yet
the
faithful
would
drop
perhaps
into
a
presbyterian
form
of
church
government
and
be
lost
the
veteran
statesman
cardinal
consalvi
evidently
thought
so
as
we
see
by
the
fourth
point
which
treats
of
spanish
america
in
the
conference
that
he
was
invited
to
hold
with
leo
xii
on
the
most
important
interests
of
the
holy
see
when
therefore
gregory
who
as
cardinal
cappellari
had
not
been
a
stranger
to
the
long
dispute
became
pope
he
ended
the
matter
promptly
and
for
ever
in
his
first
consistory
held
in
february
he
filled
a
number
of
vacant
sees
and
erected
new
ones
where
required
in
south
america
on
the
of
august
following
he
published
the
apostolic
constitution
ecclesiarum
in
which
he
explained
the
reasons
why
the
holy
see
in
order
to
be
able
to
govern
the
universal
church
whose
interests
are
paramount
to
all
local
disputes
recognizes
governments
without
intending
by
this
to
confer
a
new
right
detract
from
any
legitimate
claim
or
decide
upon
questions
the
republics
of
new
granada
ecuador
and
chili
were
subsequently
recognized
with
all
the
solemnities
of
international
law
in
the
country
there
were
two
episcopal
sees
during
the
spanish
dominion
these
were
santiago
and
concepcion
both
subject
to
the
metropolitan
of
lima
but
gregory
rearranged
the
chilian
episcopate
making
the
first
see
an
archbishopric
with
concepcion
la
serena
and
san
carlos
de
ancud
in
the
island
of
chiloe
for
suffragan
sees
at
the
time
that
the
apostolic
mission
to
south
america
was
determined
upon
there
was
living
in
rome
a
young
ecclesiastic
as
yet
fortune
and
to
fame
unknown
but
who
was
destined
to
become
the
first
pope
who
has
ever
been
across
the
atlantic
and
the
foremost
man
of
the
xixth
century
this
was
don
giovanni
one
of
the
fourteen
canons
of
the
collegiate
church
of
santa
maria
via
he
was
selected
by
pius
vii
to
accompany
mgr
muzi
as
adjunct
the
secretary
of
the
apostolic
delegation
was
a
priest
named
giuseppe
sallusti
who
wrote
a
full
narrative
of
the
expedition
in
which
as
cardinal
wiseman
says
minutest
details
are
related
with
the
garrulity
of
a
new
traveller
who
to
habits
of
business
and
practical
acquaintance
with
graver
matters
unites
as
is
common
in
the
south
a
dash
of
comic
humor
and
a
keen
sense
of
the
ridiculous
and
withal
a
charming
simplicity
and
freshness
of
mind
which
render
the
book
amusing
as
well
as
instructive
in
spite
of
its
heavy
quotations
from
that
lightest
of
poets
it
is
in
vols
with
a
map
comparatively
only
a
small
portion
of
the
work
is
taken
up
with
the
actual
voyages
and
travels
of
the
party
the
rest
being
devoted
to
the
preliminaries
or
causes
of
the
mission
to
a
description
of
chili
and
an
account
of
the
many
missionary
establishments
which
had
once
flourished
as
well
as
of
those
that
were
still
maintained
there
a
fifth
volume
was
promised
by
the
author
to
contain
the
documents
official
acts
and
results
of
the
mission
but
we
believe
that
it
was
never
published
the
having
received
at
the
earnest
solicitation
of
a
learned
ecclesiastic
from
the
argentine
confederation
rev
pacheco
very
ample
faculties
not
only
for
the
country
to
which
he
was
more
immediately
accredited
but
also
for
buenos
ayres
peru
colombia
mexico
and
all
other
parts
of
the
dominions
and
accompanied
by
the
envoy
cienfuegos
and
father
raymond
arce
a
young
dominican
belonging
to
santiago
the
party
left
rome
for
bologna
where
it
rested
awhile
to
get
a
foretaste
of
the
magnificent
scenes
in
the
new
world
from
father
de
molina
who
had
long
resided
in
chili
the
next
stage
in
the
journey
was
to
genoa
the
port
of
embarkation
which
was
reached
only
on
the
of
july
but
a
series
of
almost
ludicrous
delays
the
expedition
was
detained
until
after
the
death
of
pius
vii
and
the
election
of
his
successor
leo
who
confirmed
the
mission
and
addressed
a
brief
to
the
president
of
the
chilian
republic
recommending
its
objects
and
the
welfare
of
its
members
all
matters
being
now
satisfactorily
arranged
the
party
got
on
board
the
fine
brig
on
the
of
october
the
vessel
sailed
under
sardinian
colors
and
was
manned
by
a
crew
of
men
and
officered
by
experienced
sailors
the
captain
anthony
copello
having
several
times
navigated
the
south
atlantic
the
weather
was
very
rough
as
usual
in
the
gulf
of
lyons
gurly
grew
the
sea
to
the
dismay
and
discomfiture
of
the
terrified
landsmen
as
sallusti
familiarly
calls
his
companion
suffering
horribly
from
sickness
this
was
but
the
beginning
of
many
trials
and
even
some
serious
dangers
amidst
which
we
can
well
imagine
that
the
captain
would
have
been
glad
beyond
measure
if
any
one
had
hinted
at
the
very
special
providence
that
guarded
his
ship
by
quoting
the
famous
words
times
cæsarem
vehis
et
fortunam
ejus
soon
the
approached
the
coast
of
catalonia
down
which
she
sailed
at
the
rate
of
ten
knots
an
hour
until
struck
by
a
furious
southwest
hurricane
the
so
much
dreaded
in
the
mediterranean
which
threatened
destruction
to
all
and
everything
in
its
course
to
a
landsman
like
sallusti
the
storms
encountered
on
this
voyage
would
naturally
appear
worse
than
they
really
were
and
his
frequent
account
of
and
would
perhaps
sound
like
to
an
old
tar
he
delights
in
describing
the
as
on
the
surge
to
heaven
she
flies
her
shattered
top
half
buried
in
the
and
everywhere
shows
himself
like
a
good
inland
dreadfully
afraid
of
salt
water
capt
copello
would
fain
have
put
into
valencia
for
shelter
but
it
was
feared
that
the
spanish
authorities
might
detain
his
ship
or
at
least
disembark
the
passengers
and
it
was
determined
rather
to
brave
the
elements
than
to
trust
themselves
within
gunshot
of
a
spanish
harbor
these
bold
resolutions
however
did
not
appease
the
fury
of
the
wind
and
it
finally
came
to
deciding
between
a
watery
grave
and
a
stony
prison
the
decision
was
quickly
taken
and
palma
in
the
island
of
majorca
was
fetched
in
safety
the
mission
party
was
very
inhospitably
treated
here
and
mgr
muzi
and
canon
mastai
were
ordered
to
come
on
shore
at
once
and
give
an
account
of
themselves
as
soon
as
they
had
put
foot
on
land
the
two
distinguished
ecclesiastics
were
thrust
into
a
cold
and
filthy
lazaretto
on
plea
of
sanitary
regulations
but
really
out
of
spite
for
their
character
and
destination
their
papers
were
seized
and
measures
instantly
taken
to
bring
them
to
trial
and
there
was
even
talk
of
sending
them
to
an
african
fortress
where
political
prisoners
were
confined
when
sallusti
heard
of
this
balearic
treatment
he
summoned
all
his
italian
courage
and
going
on
shore
declared
to
the
officials
that
he
would
share
the
fate
of
his
companions
but
instead
of
admiring
this
prodigality
of
a
great
soul
hor
i
those
unclassical
islanders
simply
swore
round
oaths
and
turned
him
in
with
the
rest
this
was
fortunate
in
one
sense
for
we
would
otherwise
have
missed
a
good
description
of
the
examination
of
the
three
italians
before
the
magistrates
who
behaved
rudely
the
alcade
in
his
quality
of
judge
putting
on
more
airs
than
a
roman
proconsul
further
outrages
were
threatened
but
the
intervention
of
the
and
of
the
bishop
of
palma
finally
convinced
those
proud
men
of
the
exclusively
religious
mission
of
their
victims
in
view
of
subsequent
events
in
italy
it
seems
strange
that
the
future
pope
should
have
been
saved
from
further
indignities
and
perhaps
from
a
dungeon
by
an
agent
of
the
piedmontese
government
yet
so
it
was
the
italians
were
permitted
to
return
to
the
ship
but
a
demand
was
made
to
deliver
up
the
two
chilians
as
rebellious
spanish
subjects
this
was
promptly
refused
but
notwithstanding
a
great
deal
of
blustering
and
many
threats
the
case
was
allowed
to
drop
and
the
sailed
away
after
several
detention
gibraltar
was
passed
on
the
of
october
and
a
severe
storm
having
tossed
the
brig
about
unmercifully
on
her
entry
into
the
atlantic
the
peak
of
teneriffe
loomed
up
on
november
after
leaving
the
canary
islands
the
was
hailed
one
dark
night
by
a
shot
across
her
bows
which
came
from
a
colombian
privateer
and
quickly
brought
her
to
she
was
quickly
boarded
and
a
gruff
voice
demanded
her
papers
and
to
have
the
crew
and
passengers
mustered
on
deck
sallusti
was
in
mortal
dread
and
to
judge
from
his
description
of
the
scene
he
must
have
been
quaking
with
fear
but
don
giovanni
mastai
behaved
with
that
calmness
and
dignity
which
even
then
began
to
be
remarked
in
him
in
whatever
circumstances
he
found
himself
after
some
delay
the
brig
was
allowed
to
proceed
nothing
being
taken
off
but
a
bottle
of
good
malaga
wine
which
however
was
rather
than
stolen
by
the
rover
of
the
seas
after
a
time
the
cape
verd
islands
appeared
in
all
their
richness
and
on
the
of
the
month
the
line
was
crossed
amidst
the
usual
riot
of
sailors
and
with
the
payment
of
a
generous
ransom
by
the
clergy
on
december
the
lay
becalmed
alongside
of
a
slaver
crowded
with
poor
africans
on
their
way
to
brazil
sallusti
complains
about
this
time
of
bad
water
and
short
rations
and
mentions
with
particular
disgust
that
the
fare
generally
consisted
of
potatoes
and
lean
chickens
on
the
a
man
fell
overboard
in
a
dreadful
gale
and
was
rescued
with
difficulty
christmas

celebrated
as
well
as
circumstances
permitted
and

neat
little
oratory

been
fitted
up
in

by

welcome
cry
of

heard
from

at
the
about

and
the
crew
and
passengers
united
upon
deck
to
return
fervent
thanks
to
almighty
god
the
land
sighted
was
a
small
desert
island
a
little
north
of
cape
santa
maria
off
the
coast
of
uruguay
a
fearful
storm
was
encountered
the
next
evening
at
the
mouth
of
the
la
plata
this
was
one
of
those
southwestern
gales
called
which
frequently
blow
with
inconceivable
fury
causing
singular
fluctuations
in
the
depth
of
the
wide
mouth
of
the
river
it
raged
so
that
the
captain
was
obliged
to
cut
his
cable
and
abandon
the
shelter
of
flores
island
which
he
had
sought
when
it
began
and
to
take
to
the
open
sea
again
with
better
weather
he
returned
and
dropped
anchor
opposite
montevideo
on
the
evening
of
january
sallusti
goes
into
raptures
over
the
beautiful
aspect
of
the
city
as
seen
from
the
bay
its
broad
and
regular
streets
its
stately
houses
built
on
a
gentle
elevation
its
fine
cathedral
the
strains
of
music
borne
over
the
water
everything
enchanted
the
travellers
weary
of
a
three
voyage
sails
were
with
many
a
melting
close
solemn
and
slow
the
evening
anthem
rose
rose
to
the
virgin
the
hour
of
day
when
setting
suns
summer
seas
display
a
path
of
glory
opening
in
the
west
to
golden
climes
and
islands
of
the
blest
and
human
voices
on
the
balmy
air
went
the
waves
in
songs
of
gladness
there
as
soon
as
the
news
got
abroad
of
a
delegation
from
the
pope
the
whole
city
was
in
a
joyful
commotion
and
a
deputation
consisting
of
the
cathedral
chapter
four
other
secular
priests
and
two
dominican
fathers
came
to
the
ship
to
pay
their
respects
to
mgr
muzi
who
was
also
invited
on
shore
and
pressed
with
every
offer
of
assistance
by
the
most
honorable
representatives
of
the
laity
these
kind
attentions
could
not
induce
the
party
to
land
and
as
soon
as
damages
were
repaired
and
a
pilot
received
sail
was
made
for
buenos
ayres
which
was
sighted
at
two
of
january
but
just
while
the
passengers
were
all
on
deck
watching
the
approaches
to
the
city
they
were
assailed
and
driven
below
by
myriads
of
mosquitoes
sallusti
is
very
vehement
against
these
sharp
little
insects
and
bewails
the
lot
of
those
who
must
live
among
them
but
he
carefully
avoids
a
comparison
with
the
of
his
native
italy
although
the
passengers
remained
on
board
that
night
crowds
of
people
lined
the
shore
and
after
salutes
of
artillery
greeted
them
with
cries
of
live
the
vicar
apostolic
for
america
to
chili
on
the
following
day
the
captain
of
the
port
and
his
suite
came
off
to
the
brig
bringing
a
courteous
note
from
the
governor
offering
a
public
reception
for
which
preparations
had
already
been
made
and
the
hospitalities
of
the
city
to
the
members
of
the
mission
this
was
declined
for
reasons
that
are
not
very
clear
but
although
the
archbishop
gave
his
bad
health
as
the
principal
excuse
we
suspect
that
cienfuegos
impressed
upon
the
italians
that
the
mission
being
directed
to
country
it
were
uncourtly
to
parade
it
before
reaching
its
destination
by
their
minds
such
a
view
would
be
accepted
as
when
the
party
did
land
they
put
up
at
a
hotel
called
three
kings
kept
by
a
jolly
englishman
who
treated
them
right
royally
and
made
them
pay
in
proportion
during
their
twelve
stay
in
buenos
ayres
the
archbishop
and
his
suite
received
every
mark
of
reverence
from
the
people
yet
the
officials
maintained
a
cold
reserve
since
the
refusal
to
accept
their
invitation
even
the
ecclesiastical
authority
such
as
it
was
put
on
very
bad
airs
zavaletta
a
simple
priest
but
administrator
of
the
diocese
having
the
audacity
to
withdraw
from
mgr
muzi
permission
which
had
been
previously
granted
to
give
confirmation
at
the
time
of
the
arrival
of
the
apostolic
mission
the
provinces
of
the
rio
de
la
plata
which
had
formed
part
of
the
spanish
viceroyalty
of
buenos
ayres
had
been
united
from
to
but
were
now
in
a
state
of
political
isolation
somewhat
like
that
of
the
states
of
the
american
union
before
the
federal
constitution
was
adopted
soon
after
the
arrival
of
the
mission
another
general
congress
was
called
still
the
italians
were
not
impressed
as
it
was
important
that
they
should
be
to
obtain
proper
consideration
at
rome
with
the
idea
of
a
strong
government
holding
sway
over
a
vast
and
wealthy
territory
on
the
of
january
at
nine
in
the
forenoon
the
party
began
the
journey
across
the
continent
three
great
covered
wagons
each
drawn
by
four
horses
and
guided
by
twelve
postilions
composed
the
train
while
a
courier
went
ahead
to
hunt
up
quarters
and
a
mounted
orderly
with
a
very
long
sword
and
a
beard
brought
up
the
rear
or
pranced
about
the
flanks
of
the
line
the
drivers
kept
around
in
no
particular
order
sonorously
cracking
their
whips
and
uttering
loud
sounds
which
probably
were
not
oaths
to
the
unaccustomed
ears
of
sallusti
besides
the
three
italians
there
was
cienfuegos
with
four
young
chilians
in
his
company
and
two
servants
so
that
the
whole
party
was
pretty
numerous
and
the
more
so
when
a
little
further
on
six
gallant
guachos
were
added
as
an
escort
only
fifteen
miles
were
made
the
first
day
which
brought
the
party
to
moron
where
confirmation
was
given
at
a
miserable
rancho
called
lujan
the
archbishop
said
his
first
mass
on
the
pampas
at
a
rich
altar
improvised
for
him
by
the
of
the
place
and
surmounted
by
four
massive
silver
candlesticks
the
room
was
hung
round
with
rich
damask
hangings
it
was
like
a
jewel
in
a
the
arecife
stream
was
crossed
in
boats
by
the
travellers
but
forded
by
the
wagons
and
horsemen
the
superb
parana
river
was
reached
at
san
pedro
and
thence
the
route
lay
through
a
rich
and
beautiful
country
to
the
important
town
of
rosario
on
the
high
precipitous
banks
of
the
great
river
at
the
outskirts
of
this
place
the
party
was
met
by
the
parish
priest
and
confirmation
was
administered
the
next
day
to
an
immense
number
of
the
faithful
long
deprived
of
this
sacrament
from
rosario
which
they
left
on
the
morning
of
the
the
journey
was
long
weary
and
dangerous
on
account
of
the
roving
bands
of
indians
which
at
that
period
scoured
the
plains
in
all
directions
to
cut
off
herdsmen
and
small
parties
of
travellers
or
traders
making
a
booty
of
their
baggage
killing
the
men
and
carrying
women
and
children
into
captivity
at
a
little
station
called
orqueta
the
party
caught
sight
for
the
first
time
of
a
wild
indian
who
was
lurking
about
the
place
in
a
very
suspicious
manner
but
kept
at
a
respectful
distance
from
the
guachos
when
sallusti
saw
this
man
apparently
spying
out
the
route
and
strength
of
the
party
the
marrow
nearly
froze
in
his
bones
and
he
certainly
had
good
cause
for
alarm
it
happened
that
leaving
buenos
ayres
a
few
days
earlier
than
had
been
given
out
was
lucky
for
a
large
band
of
these
mounted
savages
armed
with
lances
and
lassos
had
got
wind
of
the
arrival
of
great
personages
from
europe
carrying
it
was
reported
an
immense
amount
of
treasure
to
the
pacific
coast
and
had
formed
a
plan
to
attack
them
which
was
defeated
only
by
mistaking
the
day
of
their
departure
whereby
their
arrival
at
the
lonely
and
post
of
desmochados
was
miscalculated
three
days
after
the
mission
party
had
passed
the
indians
to
the
number
of
about
three
hundred
swooped
down
upon
the
place
but
instead
of
finding
the
rich
foreigners
they
surrounded
only
a
miserable
set
of
twenty
peons
escorting
a
lot
of
goods
across
the
plains
these
were
all
massacred
except
one
who
although
badly
wounded
and
left
for
dead
survived
to
tell
the
story
and
describe
the
fiendish
disappointment
of
the
savages
at
not
capturing
the
prey
they
expected
at
frayle
muerto
mgr
muzi
received
through
the
agency
of
cienfuegos
a
polite
message
from
the
clergy
of
cordova
but
having
sent
his
return
compliments
directly
instead
of
through
the
channel
of
original
communication
the
chilian
thought
himself
slighted
and
separated
from
the
mission
party
preceding
it
a
good
distance
and
taking
with
him
besides
his
own
attendants
the
orderly
in
brilliant
uniform
who
the
europeans
had
the
mortification
of
seeing
was
meant
to
distinguish
the
although
a
subordinate
in
clerical
rank
such
is
human
nature
whether
at
courts
or
on
a
dusty
plain
after
passing
through
several
small
settlements
and
the
more
important
town
of
san
luis
being
everywhere
well
received
the
fine
old
city
of
mendoza
was
reached
on
the
of
february
it
seemed
as
if
the
entire
population
had
turned
out
to
honor
the
distinguished
arrivals
triumphal
arches
were
erected
troops
were
drawn
up
under
arms
processions
of
citizens
and
clergy
marshalled
from
every
house
tapestry
was
suspended
while
the
balconies
were
filled
with
ladies
who
threw
down
flowers
in
the
path
of
the
apostolic
vicar
as
he
entered
the
town
and
proceeded
to
the
house
of
a
noble
and
wealthy
lady
doña
emmanuela
corbalan
in
which
everything
had
been
prepared
on
the
grandest
scale
of
provincial
magnificence
and
where
cienfuegos
in
all
his
glory
and
recovered
temper
was
waiting
to
receive
him
and
canon
count
mastai
who
were
to
be
lodged
there
during
their
stay
the
secretary
sallusti
being
handed
over
to
a
less
worshipful
host
religious
and
civic
festivals
excursions
in
the
environs
to
the
vineyards
gardens
farms
and
with
other
congenial
occupations
detained
the
party
very
agreeably
during
nine
days
in
this
neat
and
pleasant
town
the
climate
of
which
is
noted
for
its
salubrity
on
the
they
left
mendoza
and
had
a
delightful
trip
on
horseback
over
good
roads
and
through
a
civilized
country
for
miles
to
the
foot
of
the
mighty
andes
they
were
now
on
the
eastern
range
of
the
cordilleras
at
the
paramilla
mountains
which
are
about
ten
thousand
feet
high
and
partly
covered
with
wood
between
these
and
the
western
range
they
traversed
near
degrees
south
latitude
a
wide
valley
sterile
and
impregnated
with
salt
for
over
forty
miles
called
the
uspallata
for
fifteen
miles

road
was
level
and
the
remainder
winding
up
and
down
the
hills
which
skirt
both
ranges
after
crossing
this
valley
they
struck
the
great
range
of
the
andes
which
is
between
fifty
and
sixty
miles
in
width
consisting
of
four
or
five
parallel

and

which
leads
over
them
is
called
the
summit
pass
and
attains
an
elevation
of
twelve
thousand
four
hundred
and
feet
above
the
level
of
the
sea
our
travellers
crossed
on
mules
by
this
road
getting
to
the
north
of
them
amidst
piles
of
perpetual
snow
a
magnificent
view
of
the
grand
volcano
of
aconcagua
which
is
nearly
thousand
feet
high
the
passage
of
the
mountains
was
grand
and
impressive
but
was
not
made
without
danger
to
the
lives
of
some
of
the
party
particularly
on
the
of
february
from
la
cumbre
there
is
a
gradual
descent
to
the
city
of
santiago
on
the
of
march
the
travellers
cast
their
admiring
gaze
upon
the
pacific
slope
which
from
that
day
until
they
entered
the
capital
of
chili
on
the
of
the
month
passing
through
and
over
the
magnificent
plains
of
chacabuco
was
a
continually
shifting
panorama
of
natural
beauty
enhanced
by
villages
convents
and
churches
perched
on
the
side
of
verdant
hills
or
nestling
in
the
fruitful
valleys
at
every
their
hearts
were
filled
with
a
holy
joy
to
witness
the
demonstrations
of
faith
among
the
people
and
of
loyalty
to
their
great
spiritual
chief
on
earth
represented
by
mgr
muzi
the
party
entered
santiago
as
was
said
on
the
and
going
to
the
cathedral
the
archbishop
intoned
pontifically
the
with
the
assistance
of
a
future
pope
and
of
the
historian
of
the
apostolic
mission
the
members
of
the
legation
were
lodged
in
a
house
near
the
and
although
we
know
little
of
the
occupations
of
canon
mastai
in
chili
it
is
certain
that
he
made
himself
personally
very
agreeable
how
could
it
be
otherwise
man
of
letters
and
of
manners
too
of
manners
sweet
as
virtue
always
wears
when
gay
good
nature
dresses
her
in
we
have
been
told
by
a
distinguished
chilian
that
canonico
mastai
was
a
frequent
guest
in
santiago
at
the
house
of
his
uncle
don
francisco
ruiz
tagle
and
used
to
go
out
with
him
quite
often
to
his
although
the
mission
was
received
with
an
almost
universal
outburst
of
enthusiasm
and
notwithstanding
the
majority
of
the
clergy
and
people
was
well
disposed
it
met
with
considerable
opposition
from
a
fierce
and
fanatical
party
of
freemasons
which
threw
every
obstacle
in
the
way
of
close
relations
with
rome
cardinal
wiseman
says
in
the
article
in
the
from
which
we
have
already
quoted
that
was
jealousy
and
bad
faith
on
the
part
of
the
chilian
government
and
want
of
tact
and
bad
management
we
fear
on
the
part
of
the
head
of
the
unfortunately
the
government
was
in
a
transition
state
between
the
presidency
of
and
the
election
of
his
successor
freire
and
administered
by
a
where
there
were
so
many
voices
there
was
much
confusion
cienfuegos
however
seems
to
have
done
his
duty
and
he
was
rewarded
in
by
the
bishopric
of
concepcion
which
had
been
vacant
for
fourteen
years
he
died
in
with
regard
to
the
causes
of
the
failure
of
the
mission
we
will
not
conceal
what
we
have
heard
from
an
excellent
senator
of
chili
although
we
mention
it
reservedly
that
one
at
least
of
the
reasons
was
a
suspicion
that
muzi
intended
to
put
italians
in
the
sees
vacant
or
to
be
erected
in
chili
from
santiago
mgr
muzi
and
his
party
went
to
valparaiso
and
embarked
for
their
return
voyage
on
the
of
october
the
remarks
of
the
celebrated
spaniard
balmes
upon
the
visit
of
the
future
pope
to
the
new
world
find
their
place
here
is
certainly
in
grand
scenes
an
influence
which
expands
and
nerves
the
soul
and
when
these
are
united
to
the
contemplation
of
different
races
varied
in
civilization
and
manners
the
mind
acquires
a
largeness
of
sentiment
most
favorable
to
the
development
of
the
understanding
and
the
heart
widening
the
sphere
of
thought
and
ennobling
the
affections
on
this
account
it
is
pleasing
above
all
things
to
see
the
youthful
missionary
destined
to
occupy
the
chair
of
peter
traverse
the
vast
ocean
admire
the
magnificent
rivers
and
superb
chains
of
mountains
in
america
travel
through
those
forests
and
plains
where
a
rich
and
fertile
soil
left
to
itself
displays
with
ostentatious
luxury
its
inborn
treasures
by
the
abundance

and
beauty
of
its
productions

and
inanimate

risks
among
savages

in
wretched
hovels
or
on
the
open

beneath
that
brilliant

which
astonishes

traveller
in
the
southern
hemisphere
providence
which
destined
the
young
to
reign
over
a
people
and
to
govern
the
universal
church
led
him
by
the
hand
to
visit
various
nations
and
to
contemplate
the
marvels
of
a
remote
but
very
providential
consequence
of
the
visit
of
pius
ix
to
america
during
his
early
career
was
the
establishment
of
the
south
american
college
at
rome
called
officially
in
italian
the
americano
which
educates
aspirants
to
the
priesthood
from
brazil
and
all
parts
of
the
american
continent
where
the
spanish
language
is
spoken
a
wealthy
intelligent
and
influential
chilian
priest
don
ignacio
eyzaguirre
who
had
been
of
the
house
of
representatives
in
and
was
an
author
of
repute
was
charged
by
pius
ix
in
to
visit
the
dioceses
of
south
and
central
america
and
mexico
to
obtain
the
views
of
the
several
bishops
upon
the
necessity
of
founding
an
ecclesiastical
seminary
at
rome
the
project
was
universally
acceptable
and
funds
having
been
provided
the
holy
father
giving
liberally
from
his
private
purse
a
beginning
was
made
in
when
a
part
of
the
theatine
convent
of
san
andrea
was
given
up
to
the
students
who
were
put
under
the
direction
of
jesuit
fathers
this
location
was
only
temporary
and
the
college
was
soon
transferred
to
the
large
house
of
the
general
of
the
dominicans
attached
to
the
convent
of
santa
maria
and
facing
the
piazza
however
it
has
been
moved
again
and
in
occupied
the
right
wing
of
the
novitiate
at
san
andrea
on
the
quirinal
with
inmates
as
if
this
worthy
establishment
had
to
figure
in
its
shifting
fortune
the
unsettled
state
of
so
many
of
the
spanish
american
countries
it
has
again
been
disturbed
yet
to
suffer
at
the
hands
of
victor
emanuel
and
his
sacrilegious
band
is
the
indication
of
a
good
cause

prepare

meet
other
although
hardly
worse
enemies

the
new

its

it
findeth
day
dream
on
christmas
eve
they
had
quarrelled
these
two
it
matters
not
about
what
trifle
till
the
hot
bitter
words
seemed
to
have
formed
an
impassable
barrier
and
a
silence
fell
between
them
that
the
lowering
brow
and
compressed
lip
told
would
not
be
easily
broken
both
had
loving
hearts
and
treasured
each
other
above
all
earthly
things
they
had
real
sorrows
enough
to
make
imaginary
ones
glance
off
lightly
for
the
second
christmas
had
not
yet
cast
its
snows
on
their
grave
the
thought
of
each
was
been
here
this
would
not
have
but
pride
was
strong
and
the
relenting
thoughts
were
hidden
behind
a
cold
exterior
it
was
the
week
before
christmas
and
laura
the
eldest
was
assisting
to
trim
the
village
church
and
in
the
holy
presence
the
dark
thought
faded
and
tender
memories
seemed
to
reassert
their
olden
sway
and
on
returning
from
her
occupation
she
formed
the
resolution
to
stop
this
folly
and
make
advances
towards
assuming
the
old
happy
life
black
asked
after
you
nell
she
said
as
she
laid
aside
her
wrappings
and
turned
cheerily
to
the
fire
wants
you
to
play
during
the
rehearsal
of
the
new
benediction
for
c
will
be
but
she
was
met
by
a
stony
look
and
closed
lips
nell
she
said
half
impatiently
be
so
dignified
why
do
you
love
that
temper
of
yours
so
dearly
said
let
there
be
silence
between
us
and
i
am
content
was
the
rejoinder
shall
take
care
not
to
trouble
you
in
pride
and
love
struggled
for
mastery
in
the
heart
of
the
eldest
and
it
was
a
mingling
of
both
that
brought
the
answer
in
tones
cold
enough
to
freeze
the
tenderness
of
the
words
will
come
a
silence
between
us
one
day
nell
you
will
be
glad
to
and
she
passed
from
the
room
it
come
was
the
almost
insolent
reply
but
there
was
a
mist
in
the
flashing
black
eyes
that
contradicted
the
words
they
passed
the
day
apart
from
each
other
and
at
night
although
kneeling
for
prayer
in
the
same
little
oratory
and
occupying
the
same
little
chamber
the
chilling
silence
remained
so
passed
the
next
day
and
it
was
now
christmas
eve
the
evergreens
were
all
hung
in
the
village
church
the
altar
was
radiant
with
flowers
and
tapers
the
confessionals
were
thronged
but
both
sisters
kept
aloof
and
both
hearts
were
aching
over
the
pride
and
anger
that
was
strangling
even
religion
in
their
souls
alas
alas
how
the
angels
must
have
mourned
to
see
days
of
such
especial
grace
passing
in
sin
christmas
gifts
had
been
prepared
but
neither
would
present
them
how
different
other
christmas
eves
had
been
the
gentle
mother
overseeing
every
preparation
for
the
next
day
that
was
always
celebrated
as
a
feast
of
joy
those
busy
hands
were
idle
now
and
the
white
snow
was
coldly
drifting
over
the
mound
that
loving
hearts
would
fain
have
kept
in
perpetual
summer
a
grave
except
to
those
who
have
knelt
beside
that
mound
that
seems
such
a
slight
barrier
between
the
aching
heart
and
its
treasure
and
yet
is
such
a
hopeless
inexorable
one
these
words
have
little
meaning
they
retired
early
and
as
nell
knelt
for
prayer
the
hot
tears
rolled
through
her
fingers
as
she
thought
of
other
christmas
mornings
when
they
had
been
awakened
for
early
mass
by
the
christmas
girls
that
earth
would
never
never
hear
again
but
the
icy
bands
of
pride
that
had
frozen
around
her
heart
would
not
melt
and
sleep
came
again
in
that
stony
stillness
morning
came
to
perturbed
visions
and
in
the
gray
dawn
broke
forth
from
her
lips
but
the
memory
of
the
past
few
days
checked
the
words
and
they
died
in
whispers
but
as
she
glanced
at
laura
she
saw
that
her
eyes
were
open
but
that
their
expression
was
fixed
and
rigid
she
sprang
up
with
a
vague
alarm
and
laid
her
hand
upon
the
low
broad
forehead
it
was
icy
cold
shriek
after
shriek
rang
from
her
lips
but
they
reached
not
the
ear
never
meant
it
laura
i
never
meant
it
only
come
back
that
i
may
speak
one
word
she
moaned
my
god
give
her
back
to
me
for
one
hour
and
i
will
submit
to
thy
but
her
voice
only
broke
the
silence
and
the
white
smiling
lips
on
the
bed
seemed
a
mockery
of
the
passionate
anguish
wailing
above
them
she
threw
herself
before
the
little
altar
in
her
room
mother
she
prayed
promise
solemnly
promise
that
never
never
again
will
i
give
way
to
the
passionate
temper
that
has
been
my
bane
if
she
may
only
come
back
for
one
hour
to
grant
forgiveness
for
the
awful
words
i
have
and
for
the
first
time
since
she
had
realized
her
sorrow
tears
fell
from
her
eyes
nellie
nellie
what
ails
you
said
a
familiar
voice
are
crying
in
your
sleep
on
this
merry
christmas
morning
and
oh
the
heaven
that
met
those
unclosing
eyes
laura
bending
over
her
smiling
yet
with
a
look
of
doubt
in
her
face
as
if
the
icy
barrier
had
not
yet
broken
down
my
darling
my
darling
sobbed
the
excited
girl
winding
her
arms
around
her
sister
god
it
is
only
a
dream
but
never
never
again
will
i
give
way
to
my
awful
temper
i
have
promised
it
laura
and
i
will
keep
my
and
she
did
for
though
she
lived
long
enough
for
the
dark
hair
to
lie
like
snowy
floss
under
the
cap
never
did
those
lips
utter
stinging
sarcasm
or
close
in
sullen
anger
and
often
when
her
gentle
voice
seemed
unable
to
stem
some
furious
tide
of
passion
among
her
grandchildren
would
she
tell
the
story
of
her
dream
on
christmas
eve
miserere
at
the
base
of
a
cliff
flowed
a
tiny
rivulet
the
rock
caught
the
in
his
broad
hand
and
poured
them
down
in
little
streams
to
meet
their
brothers
at
his
feet
while
the
brook
murmured
a
constant
song
of
welcome
but
a
stone
broke
from
the
cliff
and
falling
across
the
rivulet
threatened
to
cut
its
tender
thread
of
life
little
strength
is
useless
moaned
the
streamlet
i
struggle
to
move
onward
and
below
the
pebbles
are
waiting
for
their
cool
bath
the
budding
flowers
are
longing
for
my
moisture
the
little
fish
are
panting
for
their
breath
a
thousand
lives
depend
on
mine
who
will
aid
me
who
will
pity
me
until
allegri
passes
he
will
pity
you
said
the
breeze
the
cruel
malaria
seized
me
and
bound
messages
of
death
upon
me
i
cried
me
from
this
burden
from
which
i
can
not
the
wind
moan
said
some
but
no
one
listened
to
my
prayer
till
i
met
a
dreamy
musician
with
own
tenderness
in
his
deep
eyes
mercy
i
sobbed
and
the
gentle
master
plucked
branches
of
roses
and
cast
them
to
me
i
was
covered
with
roses
pierced
with
roses
filled
with
roses
their
redness
entered
my
veins
and
their
fragrance
filled
my
breath
roses
fell
upon
my
forehead
with
the
sweetness
of
a
benediction
the
death
i
bore
fled
from
me
for
nothing
evil
can
exist
in
the
presence
of
fragrance
cry
to
the
good
allegri
little
brooklet
he
will
pity
so
the
rivulet
waited
till
the
master
came
then
sighed
for
mercy
the
rock
was
lifted
and
the
stream
flowed
forward
with
a
cry
of
joy
to
share
its
happiness
with
pebble
and
flower
and
fish
a
little
bird
had
become
entangled
in
the
meshes
of
a
net
to
the
good
allegri
whispered
the
breeze
is
he
who
gave
me
to
the
good
allegri
rippled
the
brook
is
he
who
gave
me
so
the
bird
waited
till
the
master
passed
then
begged
a
share
of
his
universal
mercy
the
meshes
were
parted
and
the
bird
flew
to
the
morning
sky
to
tell
its
joy
to
the
fading
stars
and
rising
sun
yes
we
all
know
allegri
twinkled
the
stars
a
night
we
have
seen
him
at
the
bed
of
a
day
i
have
seen
him
in
the
prison
shouted
the
sun
with
the
splendor
of
a
gloria
are
those
that
doubt
that
mourn
that
suffer
wherever
are
those
that
cry
for
help
and
mercy
there
have
i
found
the
people
of
the
earth
wondered
what
made
the
sun
so
glorious
not
knowing
that
he
borrowed
light
from
the
utterance
of
a
good
name
a
multitude
of
children
had
gathered
in
the
pope
was
kneeling
in
the
sanctuary
princes
and
merchants
were
kneeling
together
under
the
vast
cupola
the
poor
were
kneeling
at
the
threshold
even
a
leper
dared
to
kneel
on
the
steps
without
and
was
allowed
the
presence
of
his
lord
all
souls
were
filled
with
longing
all
hearts
were
striving
for
expression
then
strains
of
music
arose
o
soul
cease
your
longing
o
heart
cease
your
strife
now
utterance
is
found
sadder
grew
the
tones
till
like
the
dashing
of
waves
came
the
sigh
i
struggle
to
move
onward
have
mercy
father
the
lights
flickered
and
died
a
shadow
passed
over
the
worshippers
and
the
tiber
without
stopped
in
its
course
to
listen
sadder
grew
the
tones
till
the
moan
was
heard
i
strive
to
escape
these
meshes
have
mercy
father
the
shadow
grew
deeper
and
a
little
bird
without
stopped
in
its
flight
to
listen
still
was
the
music
sadder
with
the
weight
of
the
sob
i
flee
from
this
loathsome
burden
have
mercy
father
vaster
and
darker
grew
the
shadow
and
the
very
breeze
stopped
in
its
course
to
listen
and
now
the
music
mingled
sigh
and
moan
and
sob
in
one
vast
despairing
cry
i
struggle
against
this
rock
of
doubt
have
mercy
father
vainly
i
strive
to
escape
these
meshes
of
sin
have
mercy
father
vainly
i
flee
from
this
evil
self
have
mercy
o
father
have
darker
and
deeper
and
vaster
grew
the
shadow
and
all
sin
in
those
human
hearts
stopped
in
its
triumph
to
listen
all
light
was
dead
all
sound
was
dead
was
all
hope
dead
wept
a
thousand
eyes
sobbed
a
thousand
voices
for
now
high
above
the
altar
shone
forth
the
promise
of
light
in
darkness
of
help
in
tribulation
in
sight
of
pope
and
prince
in
sight
of
rich
and
poor
and
even
in
sight
of
the
leper
kneeling
without
gleamed
the
starry
figure
of
the
cross
was
this
mass
of
allegri
so
completely
formed
cry
the
three
centuries
that
have
passed
since
then
we
have
been
able
to
add
nothing
to
its
perfection
the
calm
voice
of
nature
answers
it
is
because
his
own
love
and
mercy
were
universal
because
he
had
learned
that
all
creation
needs
the
protecting
watchfulness
of
the
maker
because
he
gave
even
the
weakest
creatures
voice
in
his
all
embracing
cry
of
miserere
and
yesterday
i
city
knoweth
nor
sign
nor
trace
of
mutable
land
or
sea
thou
who
art
changeless
grant
me
a
place
in
that
far
city
with
so
spake
she
gazing
on
the
distant
sea
that
lay
one
sheet
of
gold
in
morning
light
and
then
she
cried
make
my
blindness
sight
sick
at
heart
was
she
and
did
mistrust
no
other
hope
could
be
this
side
the
grave
than
shifting
sea
and
land
yet
dreamed
she
not
her
house
was
built
on
sand
but
fearless
thought
of
dread
eternity
and
men
admired
the
house
she
builded
fair
until
a
tempest
risen
with
sudden
shock
rent
it
then
god
made
answer
to
her
prayer
showed
her
a
city
calm
and
old
and
strong
and
changeless
set
her
on
a
rock
gave
her
with
him
a
place
in
his
true
fold
ii
oh
the
master
is
so
fair
his
smile
so
sweet
to
banished
men
that
they
who
meet
it
unaware
can
never
rest
on
earth
such
were
the
words
that
charmed
my
ear
and
heart
in
days
when
still
i
dwelt
outside
the
fold
but
now
they
seem
to
me
too
slight
and
cold
for
i
have
been
with
thee
dear
lord
apart
and
seen
barbed
and
dart
pierce
thee
beneath
the
olives
dark
and
old
until
thy
anguish
could
not
be
controlled
but
from
thy
veins
the
blood
of
life
did
start
o
word
made
flesh
made
sin
for
sinful
man
i
seek
not
now
thy
smile
so
fair
so
sweet
another
vision
haggard
pale
and
wan
of
one
who
bore
sin
and
shame
and
smart
hath
drawn
me
weeping
to
thy
sacred
feet
to
share
the
unrest
of
thy
bleeding
heart
the
year
of
our
lord
the
year
has
not
been
a
specially
remarkable
one
as
distinct
from
the
years
immediately
preceding
it
great
questions
which
affect
humanity
at
large
beyond
the
line
of
nationality
and
which
were
rife
three
or
four
years
ago
are
undecided
still
no
wars
or
revolutions
or
discoveries
or
mighty
changes
have
occurred
during
the
year
to
alter
sensibly
the
current
of
human
affairs
what
the
world
at
large
quarrelled
and
wrangled
over
a
year
two
years
three
four
years
ago
it
wrangles
over
still
and
may
for
years
yet
to
come
much
as
science
and
culture
have
done
to
break
down
the
barriers
that
separate
men
and
bring
the
human
family
nearer
together
nations
nationally
considered
stand
as
far
apart
as
ever
they
did
and
the
imaginary
line
that
divides
neighboring
peoples
finds
them
wide
apart
as
the
antipodes
to
begin
a
rapid
and
necessarily
incomplete
review
at
home
the
past
year
can
scarcely
be
regarded
as
either
a
happy
or
successful
one
commercially
speaking
in
the
united
states
preliminary
echoes
of
the
centennial
year
of
the
great
republic
have
been
heard
but
amid
them
the
crash
of
falling
banks
that
had
no
legitimate
excuse
for
falling
and
of
business
firms
that
followed
in
due
order
this
however
is
only
a
repetition
of
the
two
preceding
years
which
it
is
as
painful
as
it
would
be
useless
to
dwell
upon
here
in
a
word
business
at
large
instead
of
recovering
as
it
was
hoped
it
would
during
the
past
year
if
anything
fell
behind
and
so
continues
the
election
did
not
tend
to
enliven
it
there
are
hopes
however
of
a
real
revival
during
the
coming
centennial
year
or
at
least
of
a
beginning
on
the
road
of
improvement
there
is
the
more
reason
to
hope
for
this
that
large
branches
of
our
industries
such
as
cereals
iron
and
cotton
goods
are
beginning
to
find
a
good
foreign
market
looked
at
largely
there
are
some
things
on
which
americans
may
congratulate
themselves
during
the
year
chief
among
these
are
their
very
misfortunes
extravagance
in
living
foolish
and
vulgar
display
in
dress
and
equipage
have
disappeared
to
a
satisfactory
extent
of
course
where
wealth
abounds
and
fortunes
are
rolled
up
easily
there
will
be
shoddy
but
then
let
it
be
marked
off
and
the
world
will
not
be
the
loser
again
there
was
a
good
sign
on
the
part
of
the
people
to
form
opinions
of
their
own
regarding
the
questions
up
before
them
and
the
respective
merits
and
qualifications
of
the
various
candidates
for
election
to
be
sure
many
too
many
persons
were
elected
who
were
a
disgrace
to
their
constituencies
and
while
such
men
are
set
in
high
and
responsible
positions
it
is
vain
to
look
for
reform
in
the
thousand
abuses
that
afflict
the
conduct
of
public
affairs
still
there
was
a
hopeful
indication
of
the
right
feeling
among
the
people
perhaps
the
most
memorable
certainly
the
most
significant
event
to
catholics
in
the
history
of
this
country
took
place
during
the
year
the
venerable
archbishop
of
new
york
was
raised
by
the
holy
father
to
the
dignity
of
the
cardinalate
and
thereby
set
in
the
senate
of
the
church
of
which
christ
is
the
invisible
and
the
pope
the
successor
of
peter
the
visible
head
to
speak
of
the
fitness
of
the
holy
choice
in
selecting
archbishop
mccloskey
for
this
high
office
and
proud
privilege
of
being
the
first
american
cardinal
is
not
for
us
it
is
sufficient
to
say
that
not
catholics
alone
but
their
protestant
also
all
the
land
over
received
the
news
and
hailed
the
choice
with
acclaim
but
what
moves
us
most
is
the
significance
of
the
act
in
the
appointment
of
an
american
cardinal
in
the
united
states
the
wish
expressed
by
the
council
of
trent
has
in
this
instance
been
realized
that
great
council
ordained
respecting
the
subjects
of
the
cardinalate
that
most
holy
roman
pontiff
shall
as
far
as
it
can
be
conveniently
done
select
them
out
of
all
the
nations
of
christendom
as
he
shall
find
persons
sess
c
i
were
this
recommendation
completely
carried
out
it
would
probably
be
one
of
the
greatest
movements
that
have
taken
place
in
the
catholic
church
for
the
last
three
centuries
suppose
for
example
that
the
great
catholic
interests
throughout
the
world
were
represented
in
that
body
by
men
of
intelligence
of
known
virtue
and
large
experience
suppose
every
nationality
had
there
its
proportionate
expression
a
senate
thus
composed
would
be
the
most
august
assembly
that
ever
was
brought
together
upon
earth
it
would
be
the
only
senate
that
the
world
has
ever
witnessed
this
would
be
giving
its
proper
expression
to
the
note
of
the
universality
of
the
church
the
decisions
of
the
holy
father
on
the
of
the
church
assisted
by
the
deliberations
of
such
a
body
would
have
more
power
to
sway
the
opinions
and
actions
of
the
world
than
armies
of
bayonets
for
whatever
may
be
said
to
the
contrary
in
favor
of
and
rifled
cannon
the
force
of
public
opinion
through
such
agents
as
electricity
and
types
moves
the
world
above
all
when
supported
by
the
intelligence
virtue
and
experience
of
men
who
have
no
other
interests
at
heart
than
those
of
god
and
the
good
of
mankind
who
knows
but
the
time
has
come
to
give
this
universality
of
the
church
a
fuller
expression
is
not
divine
providence
acting
through
modern
discoveries
rendering
it
possible
for
the
human
race
to
be
not
only
one
family
in
blood
but
even
in
friendship
and
unity
of
purpose
perhaps
the
present
persecutions
of
the
church
in
italy
are
only
relieving
her
from
past
geographical
and
national
limitations
to
place
her
more
completely
in
relations
with
the
faithful
throughout
the
world
who
knows
but
the
time
is
near
when
the
holy
father
will
be
surrounded
by
representatives
of
all
nations
tribes
and
peoples
from
the
south
as
well
as
from
the
north
from
the
east
as
well
as
from
the
west
by
italians
germans
frenchmen
spaniards
englishmen
belgians
portuguese
austrians
irishmen
americans
canadians
south
americans
australians
as
well
as
by
representatives
of
the
faithful
from
the
empire
of
china
would
this
new
departure
be
anything
more
than
the
realization
of
the
wish
expressed
by
that
great
and
holy
council
held
at
trent
three
centuries
ago
in
passing
from
our
own
to
other
lands
we
can
not
do
so
at
the
opening
of
the
second
century
of
our
life
without
a
glance
at
something
larger
and
wider
than
the
mere
local
interests
of
life
which
touch
us
most
nearly
beyond
doubt
there
is
much
to
criticise
much
perhaps
to
be
ashamed
of
much
to
deplore
in
the
conduct
of
our
government
local
and
national
and
in
the
social
state
generally
of
our
people
still
we
see
nothing
at
present
existing
or
threatening
that
is
beyond
the
remedy
of
the
people
itself
it
is
a
fashion
among
our
pessimists
to
contrast
the
america
of
with
the
america
of
a
hundred
years
ago
well
we
believe
that
we
can
stand
the
contrast
the
country
has
expanded
and
developed
and
promises
so
to
continue
beyond
all
precedent
in
the
history
of
this
world
when
the
experiment
of
a
century
ago
is
contrasted
with
the
established
fact
the
nation
of
a
free
and
prosperous
people
of
we
can
only
bless
god
and
allowing
the
widest
margin
for
the
evils
and
shortcomings
in
our
midst
when
we
glance
across
the
ocean
at
nations
armed
to
the
teeth
looking
upon
one
another
as
foes
and
either
rending
with
internal
throes
or
threatening
to
be
rent
pride
in
this
country
deepens
and
the
heart
swells
with
gratitude
that
in
these
days
god
has
raised
up
a
nation
where
all
men
may
possess
their
souls
in
peace
we
have
some
alarmists
among
us
who
look
in
the
near
future
to
the
occurrence
of
scenes
in
this
country
similar
to
those
now
being
transacted
in
europe
where
men
are
persecuted
for
sake
we
can
not
share
in
these
alarms
as
we
see
no
evils
in
our
midst
which
are
beyond
the
remedy
of
the
people
so
we
see
no
religious
or
other
questions
that
may
arise
which
can
not
be
civilly
adjusted
this
is
not
a
country
where
the
raw
head
and
bloody
bones
thrive
the
question
of
religion
is
decided
once
for
all
in
the
constitution
catholics
of
course
have
a
large
heritage
of
misrepresentation
to
contend
against
but
that
is
rapidly
diminishing
a
bismarck
may
strive
to
introduce
into
our
free
country
through
a
band
of
fanatics
and
politicians
the
persecuting
spirit
which
he
has
attempted
to
introduce
into
england
by
a
gladstone
which
he
has
succeeded
in
introducing
into
italy
by
a
minghetti
and
into
switzerland
by
a
carteret
but
before
they
reach
the
hundredth
part
of
the
influence
of
the
disgraceful
party
the
good
sense
and
true
spirit
of
our
countrymen
will
as
it
did
in
the
case
of
that
party
brand
all
who
have
had
any
prominent
connection
with
the
movement
with
the
note
of
infamy
the
fanatical
cry
of
is
evidently
played
out
at
its
in
old
england
while
the
attempt
to
revive
its
echoes
will
meet
with
still
less
success
in
england
we
see
no
clouds
on
the
american
horizon
that
should
cause
catholics
any
grave
apprehension
the
end
of
such
attempts
always
is
that
those
who
strike
the
sparks
only
succeed
in
burning
their
fingers
all
we
have
to
do
is
to
walk
straight
along
in
the
path
we
have
been
following
of
common
citizenship
with
those
around
us
in
order
to
secure
for
ourselves
all
the
rights
which
we
are
ready
to
concede
to
others
the
european
situation
during
the
past
year
may
be
summed
up
under
two
headings
the
struggle
between
church
and
state
and
the
prospects
of
war
to
enter
at
any
length
into
the
question
between
church
and
state
in
germany
and
in
other
countries
in
europe
would
be
going
over
old
ground
which
has
been
covered
time
and
again
in
the
catholic
world
only
such
features
of
the
contest
will
be
touched
upon
as
may
set
the
present
situation
clearly
before
the
mind
of
the
reader
the
official
at
the
opening
of
the
past
year
said
in
a
retrospective
article
on
the
events
of
conviction
has
been
forced
upon
the
german
government
that
the
german
ultramontane
party
are
a
revolutionary
party
directed
by
foreigners
and
relying
mainly
upon
the
assistance
of
foreign
powers
the
german
government
therefore
are
under
the
necessity
of
deprecating
any
encouragement
of
the
ultramontane
party
by
foreign
powers
it
was
for
this
reason
that
the
german
government
last
year
thought
it
incumbent
on
them
to
use
plain
language
in
addressing
the
french
government
upon
the
sayings
and
doings
of
some
of
the
french
bishops
france
had
taken
the
hint
and
had
prevented
her
ultramontanes
setting
the
world
on
fire
merely
to
vent
their
spite
against
it
was
perhaps
to
be
expected
under
these
circumstances
that
abandoning
at
last
all
hope
of
foreign
assistance
the
german
ultramontanes
would
make
their
peace
with
the
government
in
prussia
and
no
longer
object
to
laws
they
willingly
obey
in
baden
bavaria
würtemberg
and
oldenburg
not
to
speak
of
austria
and
other
states
at
all
events
it
was
very
desirable
that
the
ultramontanes
should
yield
before
the
church
was
thrown
into
worse
confusion
by
their
malicious
but
impotent
such
was
the
pleasant
prospect
held
out
for
the
catholics
by
the
official
organ
at
the
opening
of
the
year
the
programme
sketched
in
it
has
been
faithfully
carried
out
and
germany
has
taken
another
step
in
the
path
of
freedom
internal
peace
and
consolidation
by
planting
its
foot
nearer
the
throat
of
the
church
it
is
useless
to
enter
into
a
refutation
of
the
falsehoods
contained
in
the
extract
from
the
official
journal
they
have
been
refuted
in
the
german
reichstag
and
all
the
world
over
it
is
needless
also
to
call
attention
to
the
tone
of
the
official
journal
and
the
manner
become
a
fashion
of
late
with
german
statesmen
and
writers
at
large
of
warning
foreign
powers
to
keep
a
civil
tongue
in
their
heads
respecting
german
matters
or
it
may
be
the
worse
for
them
how
far
the
catholics
have
yielded
to
the
kindly
invitation
held
out
to
them
the
world
has
seen
we
have
before
this
remarked
on
the
strange
anxiety
manifested
by
a
government
convinced
of
the
justice
of
its
cause
and
the
means
it
was
pursuing
towards
its
end
to
stifle
the
expression
of
public
opinion
not
only
at
home
but
abroad
moreover
the
very
fact
of
its
being
compelled
to
deprecate
encouragement
of
the
ultramontane
party
by
foreign
says
as
plainly
as
words
can
say
it
that
those
powers
see
something
in
the
party
to
encourage
here
is
a
sample
one
out
of
hundreds
such
of
the
manner
in
which
the
members
of
the
have
been
treated
during
the
year
and
of
the
crimes
sympathy
with
which
on
the
part
of
foreign
powers
is
so
earnestly
deprecated
by
the
german
government
that
extremely
active
agent
of
prince
bismarck
the
prussian
correspondent
of
the
london
tells
the
story
of
the
deposition
of
the
bishop
of
paderborn
by
the
court
thus
has
been
sentenced
to
innumerable
fines
chiefly
for
appointing
clergymen
without
the
consent
of
the
secular
authorities
is
this
a
crime
reverend
and
right
reverend
gentlemen
of
the
protestant
churches
never
paying
any
of
these
forfeits
he
has
been
repeatedly
imprisoned
and
forcibly
prevented
from
exercising
his
functions
and
now
for
the
perversity
of
the
man
the
but
impotent
notwithstanding
the
measures
taken
against
him
he
has
continued
his
opposition
to
the
state
he
would
not
allow
his
clerical
to
be
visited
by
government
inspectors
he
has
declined
to
reappoint
a
chaplain
he
had
excommunicated
without
the
consent
of
the
government
what
criminals
ss
peter
and
paul
would
be
were
they
living
in
germany
and
he
has
continually
issued
pastorals
and
made
speeches
to
deputations
breathing
the
most
hostile
sentiments
against
crown
and
parliament
sentiments
not
quoted
he
has
received
addresses
covered
with
more
than
one
hundred
thousand
signatures
and
on
a
single
day
admitted
twelve
thousand
persons
to
his
presence
who
had
come
to
condole
with
him
on
the
fate
he
was
let
it
be
borne
in
mind
that
this
is
not
our
description
but
that
of
an
agent
of
the
prussian
government
could
words
establish
more
clearly
the
side
on
which
the
criminality
lies
only
passing
mention
can
be
made
of
events
which
have
been
already
anticipated
and
commented
on
the
extension
of
the
civil
registration
of
births
deaths
and
marriages
from
prussia
to
the
whole
german
empire
passed
in
january
perhaps
no
measure
yet
has
so
aroused
the
indignation
not
only
of
catholics
but
of
believing
protestants
also
as
the
correspondent
already
quoted
tersely
puts
the
matter
all
germany
this
law
does
away
with
the
services
of
the
clergy
in
celebrating
the
three
great
domestic
events
of
that
is
to
say
there
is
no
longer
need
to
baptize
christian
children
in
the
name
of
god
there
is
no
longer
need
of
god
in
the
marriage
service
finally
as
man
comes
into
the
world
so
he
may
go
out
of
it
without
the
name
or
the
invocation
of
god
without
blessing
over
his
grave
or
the
ceremonies
of
religion
attending
the
last
act
like
a
dog
he
may
come
like
a
dog
he
may
live
like
a
dog
he
may
go
and
yet
this
is
an
evangelical
power
verily
but
of
a
strange
evangel
the
result
of
it
is
shown
already
since
the
prussian
civil
registration
law
was
passed
only
per
cent
of
all
berlin
marriages
have
been
celebrated
in
churches
while
only
thirty
per
cent
of
the
children
born
in
the
capital
have
been
baptized
by
clergymen
the
passing
of
the
landsturm
bill
converts
the
whole
german
empire
into
an
armed
camp
every
german
sound
in
wind
and
limb
must
be
a
soldier
from
the
age
of
seventeen
to
every
man
not
belonging
to
the
army
or
the
reserve
is
to
be
liable
to
be
called
out
in
the
case
of
an
actual
or
even
a
threatened
invasion
says
the
london
the
word
of
command
germany
is
arming
and
the
surrounding
nations
that
is
the
best
part
of
the
world
can
not
but
do
as
she
they
are
doing
as
she
does
and
all
the
european
powers
sleep
beside
their
arms
in
face
of
this
fact
what
comfort
can
men
take
from
the
meeting
and
hobnobbing
of
the
crowned
heads
of
europe
here
there
and
everywhere
or
of
their
assurances
of
peace
who
is
strong
enough
to
keep
the
peace
who
too
weak
to
enkindle
war
no
man
and
no
people
it
is
this
arming
and
incertitude
of
one
another
that
alone
prevented
what
locally
was
so
insignificant
an
affair
as
the
outbreak
within
the
year
of
the
bosnian
insurrection
against
turkey
from
lighting
a
universal
conflagration
the
eagles
of
the
great
powers
gather
around
the
turkish
carcase
england
seizes
beforehand
on
the
control
of
the
suez
canal
by
way
of
preparing
for
eventualities
and
the
eastern
question
begins
at
last
to
resolve
itself
into
this
simple
form
not
how
shall
we
uphold
the
empire
but
how
shall
we
divide
the
spoils
the
present
rulers
of
germany
profess
to
look
upon
their
catholic
subjects
as
the
great
foes
of
the
german
empire
the
mistake
is
a
fatal
one
for
in
binding
the
church
they
bind
the
only
power
that
can
stop
the
which
is
slowly
eating
into
the
heart
not
alone
of
germany
but
of
all
nations
that
is
socialism
the
of
infidelity
that
socialism
prevails
in
germany
the
rulers
of
that
empire
know
and
its
utterances
are
as
dreaded
as
an
encyclical
of
the
pope
here
are
the
elements
of
socialism
as
pictured
by
the
cologne
at
the
opening
of
the
year
although
the
great
bubble
schemes
burst
in
the
summer
of
and
although
last
year
a
plentiful
harvest
of
corn
and
wine
came
to
our
relief
the
consequences
of
the
crisis
are
still
felt
numerous
undertakings
are
depreciated
and
even
more
lamentable
than
the
losses
of
the
promoters
are
the
mischievous
results
of
the
sudden
excessive
rise
in
wages
which
could
not
possibly
last
the
luxurious
habits
the
strikes
and
all
that
these
involve
on
the
laboring
classes
and
the
whole
industrial
life
of
the
german
nation
habits
of
indolence
and
gluttony
have
been
established
which
it
will
be
hard
to
eradicate
and
much
more
in
the
same
strain
this
is
only
a
straw
showing
which
way
the
wind
blows
persecution
of
the
church
has
not
yet
exhausted
itself
though
beyond
the
actual
taking
of
life
it
is
hard
to
see
what
remains
to
be
done
the
final
measure
has
been
resorted
to
of
abrogating
the
articles
of
the
prussian
constitution
of
which
were
specially
drawn
up
to
provide
freedom
of
religion
and
worship
in
their
fullest
sense
of
the
attitude
of
the
german
catholics
the
prelates
the
clergy
and
the
laity
it
is
needless
to
speak
the
world
has
witnessed
it
and
the
very
fierceness
of
the
persecution
simply
serves
to
show
forth
more
gloriously
the
divinity
of
the
church
for
no
human
institution
could
live
under
it
one
result
of
the
persecution
has
been
the
return
of
a
catholic
majority
to
the
bavarian
parliament
we
hope
for
the
unity
of
the
german
empire
and
its
true
consolidation
but
it
is
not
in
our
hearts
to
support
tyranny
under
whatever
name
least
of
all
when
it
attacks
all
that
we
hold
most
sacred
the
german
policy
must
be
totally
altered
before
it
can
command
the
sympathy
of
freemen
it
must
be
totally
altered
before
it
can
command
the
respect
and
full
allegiance
of
its
subjects
so
large
and
important
a
section
of
whom
are
catholics
the
catholic
majority
in
bavaria
is
but
one
sign
of
many
of
opposition
to
the
policy
of
which
prince
bismarck
is
the
author
and
expounder
who
knows
but
that
the
threatened
dissolution
of
an
empire
erected
on
so
false
and
narrow
a
basis
has
not
already
begun
in
bavaria
all
the
sacrifices
made
to
establish
the
empire
not
the
least
of
which
were
made
by
bavaria
the
german
chancellor
by
his
determined
and
senseless
religious
persecution
would
now
seem
foolishly
to
ignore
and
these
bavarians
of
all
the
germans
once
aroused
and
their
religious
rights
infringed
upon
are
not
the
men
quietly
and
meekly
to
subside
under
opposition
we
have
dwelt
more
at
length
upon
germany
because
it
is
the
centre
of
the
strife
that
convulses
and
threatens
to
convulse
the
world
other
topics
must
consequently
be
hastily
dismissed
of
france
there
is
nothing
but
good
to
report
after
a
series
of
fiery
debates
in
the
assembly
the
constitution
of
a
conservative
republic
was
definitively
formed
and
agreed
upon
towards
the
end
of
february
the
nomination
of
councillors
of
state
was
given
to
the
president
who
resigned
the
nomination
of
the
senators
of
course
france
is
still
open
to
surprises
and
the
various
parties
seem
as
unable
to
coalesce
as
ever
but
there
is
no
question
that
the
government
of
marshal
macmahon
has
deserved
well
of
the
country
and
could
only
a
true
republic
be
established
in
france
it
would
serve
as
a
safe
to
the
absolutisms
that
threaten
the
east
of
europe
the
commerce
and
industries
of
the
country
have
advanced
even
on
the
preceding
year
though
the
imports
of
amounted
to
francs
and
the
exports
to
francs
these
figures
being
in
excess
of
those
of
any
former
years
the
returns
for
the
paris
in
indicate
how
the
poorer
and
lower
middle
classes
who
chiefly
patronize
these
establishments
are
recovering
from
the
effects
of
the
war
and
the
commune
the
deposits
amounted
to
francs
while
in
they
were
francs
and
in
francs
there
is
every
reason
to
believe
that
the
ratio
of
the
past
year
will
show
a
corresponding
increase
while
the
tokens
of
reviving
prosperity
are
thus
encouraging
those
of
a
revival
of
religious
feeling
and
coming
back
to
the
old
ways
and
the
old
faith
among
the
people
at
large
are
not
less
so
a
noble
and
patriotic
work
is
being
accomplished
in
the
rapid
formation
and
spread
of
catholic
clubs
a
direct
offset
to
the
socialism
fostered
by
the
spirit
of
irreligion
in
other
places
the
part
taken
by
catholic
laymen
of
standing
and
ability
in
this
work
so
full
of
happy
promise
is
in
itself
a
significant
feature
and
one
that
may
well
be
recommended
to
the
attention
of
catholic
laymen
all
the
world
over
the
pilgrimages
to
holy
shrines
and
to
rome
have
continued
spite
of
the
laugh
of
the
infidel
and
the
scorn
of
the
unbeliever
the
solemn
consecration
of
the
church
in
montmartre
to
the
sacred
heart
was
one
in
which
the
whole
world
was
interested
but
the
most
encouraging
measure
of
all
was
the
obtaining
after
a
fierce
battle
between
religion
and
infidelity
of
permission
to
found
free
universities
in
france
where
students
who
believe
in
god
might
if
they
chose
apply
themselves
to
the
study
of
their
faith
or
at
least
carry
on
their
studies
under
the
divine
protection
and
under
professors
who
lacking
nothing
in
intellect
recognize
a
higher
than
themselves
whose
law
they
have
the
courage
to
recognize
and
the
sense
and
piety
to
obey
surely
france
was
never
so
worthy
of
the
esteem
and
profound
respect
of
all
the
world
as
it
is
what
a
wonderful
vitality
is
displayed
by
this
race
what
people
could
so
suddenly
recover
from
what
seemed
so
fatal
a
blow
what
other
nation
would
have
shown
so
much
wisdom
and
as
these
frenchmen
whom
the
outside
world
stamped
as
as
is
france
to
be
the
leader
of
the
races
to
conform
itself
consistently
with
its
past
history
and
traditions
after
a
century
of
throes
into
a
political
form
of
society
fitted
to
its
present
needs
its
future
prosperity
and
the
renewal
of
religion
god
grant
that
it
be
so
england
true
to
its
peace
policy
still
keeps
aloof
from
the
troubled
current
of
european
affairs
beyond
its
recent
move
eastward
which
has
already
been
noticed
it
steadily
refused
to
accept
the
invitation
of
russia
to
join
the
international
conference
on
the
usages
of
war
which
in
reality
resembled
a
consultation
among
surgeons
before
beginning
to
operate
on
an
interesting
subject
premiership
has
been
marked
by
some
irritating
mistakes
though
the
securing
control
of
the
suez
canal
was
undoubtedly
a
move
in
the
present
critical
state
of
eastern
affairs
that
compensates
for
many
a
blunder
if
he
can
only
hold
the
control
gladstone
finally
retired
from
the
leadership
of
the
liberal
party
and
was
nominally
succeeded
by
the
marquis
of
hartington
the
abandoning
a
position
which
take
him
all
in
all
he
undoubtedly
adorned
went
paddling
in
theology
and
got
shipwrecked
the
gladstone
fulminations
on
are
now
a
thing
of
the
past
and
only
afforded
another
melancholy
instance
of
the
facility
with
which
even
great
men
can
go
beyond
their
depth
the
portentous
charges
against
the
pope
the
the
rusty
arsenals
and
the
rest
of
the
papal
were
received
by
the
english
people
themselves
with
honest
laughter
or
with
passive
scorn
until
finally
gladstone
lost
his
temper
and
then
the
world
became
tired
both
of
him
and
his
materialism
is
taking
deep
root
in
the
english
mind
the
leading
organ
of
english
opinion
itself
highly
respectable
but
by
no
means
religious
complained
more
than
once
during
the
year
of
the
general
apathy
with
which
the
public
regarded
the
doings
of
the
various
convocations
and
general
assemblies
of
the
protestant
churches
in
england
and
the
success
with
which
the
onslaught
by
such
a
man
as
gladstone
against
the
catholic
church
met
with
at
the
hands
of
englishmen
reveals
anew
the
fact
that
religious
feeling
has
fallen
to
so
low
an
ebb
in
england
that
even
the
most
eloquent
of
bigots
could
not
arouse
an
cry
and
this
for
england
is
the
last
stage
of
religious
apathy
is
this
again
the
immediate
precursor
of
a
reaction
in
favor
of
the
true
church
in
that
land
for
which
so
many
prayers
have
been
offered
up
and
the
blood
of
so
many
martyrs
has
been
shed
ireland
has
been
quiet
calm
and
peaceable
and
though
in
common
with
england
suffering
from
the
commercial
depression
which
spread
from
this
country
to
them
it
has
shown
a
strong
tendency
to
advance
in
prosperity
for
its
peace
the
catholic
clergy
according
to
the
testimony
of
the
london
and
as
we
believe
the
party
are
jointly
answerable
men
who
believe
in
god
and
obey
the
laws
of
the
church
will
with
honest
and
able
representatives
seek
for
no
heroic
measures
of
reform
while
the
legislature
is
fairly
open
to
complaints
the
london
says
that
the
peaceful
record
of
the
year
reads
like
a
fairy
tale
yet
the
peace
preservation
acts
were
renewed
for
which
the
same
journal
could
find
no
better
reason
than
that
can
not
break
off
abruptly
from
the
past
and
goes
on
to
say
is
possible
that
if
there
never
had
been
a
resolution
to
impose
upon
a
conquered
people
a
church
which
they
rejected
and
to
endow
it
with
the
spoils
to
which
they
remained
attached
if
there
never
had
been
a
neglect
so
little
creditable
to
our
statesmanship
as
the
conditions
under
which
agricultural
land
was
held
in
ireland
if
laws
had
never
been
passed
to
deprive
roman
catholics
of
political
privileges
and
the
right
to
possess
property
if
the
attempt
had
never
been
made
to
rule
the
inhabitants
of
the
by
a
hostile
garrison
that
state
of
feeling
would
never
have
been
created
which
imposes
upon
the
legislature
of
the
sad
necessity
of
maintaining
an
exceptional
coercive
the
bitterest
foe
of
england
could
scarcely
add
one
iota
to
the
force
of
this
terrible
indictment
of
english
legislation
in
ireland
but
we
look
with
all
hope
to
the
speedy
dispersing
of
the
clouds
which
so
long
have
hovered
over
this
real
of
saints
which
has
done
so
much
in
the
past
and
promises
so
much
in
the
future
for
the
spread
of
faith
among
the
peoples
of
the
earth
more
pleasing
topics
to
touch
upon
are
the
celebration
of
the
centennial
of
daniel
the
fiftieth
anniversary
of
the
consecration
of
the
venerable
archbishop
mchale
and
though
last
far
from
least
the
visit
to
ireland
of
cardinal
mccloskey
and
his
reception
by
cardinal
cullen
and
the
irish
people
the
scene
was
indeed
a
memorable
one
the
meeting
on
a
soil
consecrated
with
the
blood
of
saints
and
martyrs
a
soil
every
inch
of
which
could
tell
a
tale
of
a
struggle
of
centuries
for
the
faith
of
two
cardinals
of
the
church
that
guards
the
representatives
in
their
own
persons
of
the
newest
and
one
of
the
oldest
heritages
of
the
church
and
the
one
irish
by
birth
the
other
irish
by
blood
a
meeting
no
less
significant
was
that
in
england
between
the
cardinal
of
new
york
and
cardinal
manning
the
first
convert
probably
who
ever
wore
the
title
a
man
of
indomitable
activity
a
fearless
asserter
of
the
rights
of
the
church
and
always
foremost
in
every
movement
which
aims
at
the
amelioration
of
the
condition
of
the
working
classes
russia
continues
her
strides
in
the
east
nearing
hindostan
and
with
hindostan
the
sea
at
every
step
despite
occasional
reverses
her
march
against
the
conflicting
tribes
and
peoples
that
lie
in
her
path
can
only
be
regarded
as
irresistible
meanwhile
at
home
she
is
eaten
up
by
sects
and
the
socialistic
spirit
that
pervades
other
nations
and
which
tyranny
may
stifle
for
a
time
but
can
not
destroy
again
the
mistake
occurs
of
regarding
the
catholic
church
as
her
enemy
and
dragooning
her
catholic
subjects
with
a
creed
which
their
consciences
reject
austria
is
engaged
in
the
attempt
to
set
her
internal
affairs
in
order
and
to
recover
from
the
defeat
at
sadowa
she
finds
time
notwithstanding
to
attack
the
church
though
without
the
persistent
brutality
of
her
german
neighbor
whose
offer
to
procure
a
joint
interference
among
the
nations
in
the
election
of
the
next
pope
was
politely
but
firmly
rejected
by
austria
in
this
path
italy
also
walks
rejecting
the
rough
hempen
cord
with
which
germany
binds
and
strives
to
strangle
the
church
italy
true
to
her
national
character
chooses
one
of
silk
which
shall
do
the
work
softly
and
noiselessly
but
none
the
less
securely
sine
thus
the
law
of
guarantees
of
which
was
founded
on
maxim
of
free
church
in
a
free
state
provided
for
the
absolute
freedom
of
the
pope
in
spirituals
this
germany
resents
and
early
in
the
year
made
strong
remonstrance
with
italy
to
see
in
plain
english
if
some
plan
could
not
be
devised
by
which
the
pope
might
be
muzzled
and
prevented
from
issuing
encyclicals
and
bulls
and
so
forth
save
only
such
as
might
please
the
mind
of
present
german
statesmen
italy
refused
to
alter
the
law
but
now
in
november
we
find
minghetti
the
president
of
the
council
stating
to
his
electors
at
that
there
are
defects
in
the
law
of
papal
guarantees
the
church
says
that
excellent
authority
minghetti
is
the
congregation
of
all
the
faithful
including
of
course
minghetti
himself
but
the
state
on
whom
with
the
devolves
also
the
is
bound
to
see
that
the
right
of
the
laity
and
the
interest
of
the
lower
clergy
be
not
sacrificed
to
the
abuse
of
papal
and
episcopal
authority
wherefore
minghetti
urged
solely
by
the
desire
of
seeing
that
no
injustice
is
done
pledges
his
electors
that
he
will
bring
in
a
bill
empowering
the
laity
to
reclaim
the
rights
to
which
they
are
entitled
in
the
government
of
the
church
how
far
those
rights
extend
of
course
remains
to
be
seen
the
holy
father
is
still
spared
to
us
in
the
full
enjoyment
of
his
health
and
powers
of
mind
pilgrims
flock
to
him
in
thousands
and
the
eyes
of
the
world
friends
and
foes
alike
look
with
sympathy
upon
him
surely
now
is
the
real
triumph
of
his
reign
and
in
his
weakness
shines
forth
his
true
strength
no
earthly
motives
if
ever
they
affected
the
allegiance
of
catholics
to
him
could
affect
it
now
yet
what
does
the
world
witness
as
men
regard
things
a
weak
and
powerless
old
man
ruling
from
the
palace
that
is
his
prison
the
hearts
of
two
hundred
millions
of
people
in
the
name
and
by
the
power
of
jesus
christ
whose
saintly
vicar
he
is
the
pope
lifted
above
all
entanglements
by
recent
events
with
the
political
policy
of
catholic
countries
his
voice
as
the
head
of
the
church
is
heard
and
respected
by
all
nations
as
perhaps
it
never
was
at
any
other
period
of
time
spain
opened
with
a
new
revolution
the
of
alfonso
the
son
of
the
exiled
queen
to
the
kingdom
and
the
throne
from
which
she
was
driven
this
being
said
the
situation
remains
in
much
the
same
condition
that
it
has
done
for
the
past
two
years
if
anything
notwithstanding
some
defections
and
reverses
don
carlos
has
gained
in
strength
and
boldness
the
move
that
brought
in
don
alfonso
was
a
good
one
but
it
came
too
late
the
customary
chronic
revolutions
prevail
in
south
america
the
assassination
of
garcia
moreno
the
able
and
good
president
of
ecuador
by
members
of
a
secret
society
added
a
unique
chapter
of
horrors
and
dastardly
cowardice
to
the
records
of
these
societies
showing
that
to
accomplish
their
purpose
they
are
ready
to
stab
a
nation
garcia
mareno
died
a
martyr
to
his
faith
from
a
far
different
cause
though
by
the
same
means
died
sonzogno
the
editor
of
the
the
trial
of
whose
assassins
furnished
food
for
thought
as
to
the
force
at
work
in
regenerated
italy
an
event
that
might
have
been
of
great
importance
was
the
death
of
the
youthful
emperor
of
china
which
was
followed
by
that
of
his
wife
he
was
succeeded
by
a
child
five
years
old
and
the
government
seems
to
have
passed
into
the
hands
of
the
same
men
who
held
it
before
so
that
a
change
for
the
better
towards
christians
is
scarcely
to
be
hoped
for
while
christian
residents
are
still
exposed
at
any
moment
to
a
repetition
of
the
massacre
with
the
year
closes
the
third
quarter
of
the
most
eventful
century
perhaps
which
the
world
has
yet
known
the
first
century
of
the
christian
era
alone
being
excepted
it
opened
on
what
lacordaire
has
well
called
wild
and
stormy
morning
and
he
would
be
a
bold
prophet
who
should
predict
a
clear
sky
at
the
close
a
writer
of
the
day
describes
nations
within
the
past
year
as
engaged
in
wild
the
same
is
true
of
the
century
nations
seem
to
have
learned
nothing
but
forgotten
much
in
forgetting
the
faith
that
made
them
whole
they
have
forgotten
the
secret
of
the
elixir
of
national
life
hence
bitter
as
the
struggle
is
a
catholic
can
not
but
hope
much
in
the
near
future
from
the
present
trials
of
the
church
the
blows
of
germany
have
crushed
shams
to
the
earth
and
caused
the
truth
to
shine
forth
resplendent
and
beautiful
whatever
may
be
this
faith
that
the
nations
have
forgotten
that
has
been
a
mockery
among
men
of
the
world
it
is
manifest
at
least
that
there
is
a
profound
reality
in
it
and
a
vitality
that
no
power
on
earth
can
hope
to
destroy
this
testimony
of
strength
in
weakness
of
the
purest
devotion
and
loftiest
sacrifices
that
this
world
can
show
if
it
do
nothing
else
at
least
brings
men
to
ponder
and
look
back
and
compare
and
inquire
and
arrive
at
some
conclusions
for
the
world
can
not
remain
an
indifferent
spectator
to
a
question
that
is
wide
as
the
world
the
vagaries
of
belief
the
churches
with
fronts
of
brass
and
feet
of
clay
the
parasites
and
the
flatterers
who
professing
to
worship
and
believe
in
god
alone
bow
down
in
secret
before
the
prince
of
this
world
now
slink
away
in
shame
or
stand
abashed
before
the
unbeliever
again
considering
the
intensity
of
the
activity
of
the
age
induced
in
a
great
measure
by
the
facilities
of
expressing
and
communicating
our
thoughts
of
reaching
the
uttermost
parts
of
the
earth
in
a
flash
of
time
all
of
which
enhances
the
responsibility
of
our
free
will
religion
in
view
of
these
facts
will
have
to
keep
pace
with
this
activity
in
order
to
perform
the
office
for
which
god
established
it
upon
earth
that
she
will
do
so
is
as
much
a
matter
of
certitude
as
her
existence
for
that
same
which
fills
the
whole
finds
in
her
bosom
his
the
general
tendency
to
material
science
and
the
material
interests
of
nations
which
have
so
wonderfully
increased
within
the
century
tend
all
to
obscure
the
supernatural
but
there
is
nothing
to
be
feared
from
the
advocates
of
material
science
there
is
no
escaping
from
god
in
his
creation
and
these
men
in
their
way
in
common
with
the
more
open
persecutors
are
preparing
for
the
triumph
of
the
church
and
in
the
providence
of
god

in
the
more
complete
demonstration
of
his
divine
truth
new
publications
life
of
the
apostle
john
by
baunard
translated
from
the
first
french
edition
new
york
the
catholic
publication
society
the
life
and
character
of
john
are
so
beautiful
and
so
closely
connected
with
our
saviour
that
true
believers
have
always
craved
to
know
more
about
him
on
the
other
hand
his
testimony
is
so
positive
and
his
language
so
clear
that
all
who
blaspheme
the
divinity
of
our
lord
have
sought
to
thrust
him
and
his
gospel
out
of
sight
the
distinguished
french
author
has
a
warm
personal
devotion
to
john
and
has
devoted
himself
with
great
enthusiasm
to
the
task
of
collecting
all
the
historical
facts
which
remain
to
us
as
connected
with
the
virgin
apostle
his
style
is
manifestly
infused
with
his
spirit
and
hence
the
work
is
one
rather
of
devotion
than
of
cold
scientific
dissertation

says
the
author
in
his
preface
book
of
doctrine
i
address
it
to
all
those
who
desire
to
instruct
themselves
in
the
truth
of
god
truth
has
no
school
above
that
of
the
gospel
and
nowhere
does
it
appear
fairer
or
more
profound
than
in
the
gospel
of
john
is
a
book
of
piety
i
dedicate
it
to
christians
to
priests
the
priesthood
has
no
higher
personification
than
john
to
virgins
john
was
a
virgin
to
mothers
he
merited
to
be
given
as
a
son
to
the
mother
of
god
to
youth
he
was
the
youngest
of
the
apostles
to
old
men
it
is
the
name
he
gives
himself
in
his
epistles
i
offer
it
to
suffering
souls
he
stood
beside
the
cross
to
contemplative
souls
he
was
on
mt
thabor
to
all
souls
who
wish
to
devote
themselves
to
their
brethren
and
to
love
them
in
god
charity
can
have
no
purer
ideal
than
the
friend
of
it
goes
to
fill
up
a
most
important
gap
in
our
english
hagiography
and
will
be
greeted
with
much
satisfaction
by
those
desirous
of
having
a
complete
series
of
lives
of
the
saints
the
ship
in
the
desert
by
joaquin
miller
boston
roberts
brothers
the
title
of
this
work
leads
one
to
look
for
an
arabian
romance
whereas
the
story
has
scarcely
anything
to
do
with
it
and
is
a
very
slender
story
at
that
it
is
difficult
to
say
whether
the
book
is
worth
reading
or
not
for
while
no
doubt
it
contains
passages
of
considerable
force
and
beauty
we
are
quite
sure
the
poet
himself
does
not
know
half
the
time
what
he
means
now
this
kind
of
thing
is
far
be
it
from
us
to
accuse
the
divine
tennyson
of
straining
and
affectation
but
we
do
say
there
are
peculiarities
in
his
style
which
it
is
dangerous
to
imitate
taken
as
a
model
for
classic
and
scholarly
verse
he
has
no
equal
in
the
english
language
but
the
subjectivism
of
his
may
be
easily
into
the
hence
he
has
given
rise
we
suspect
he
is
full
sore
over
it
to
what
may
be
called
the
school
of
poetry
we
think
this
school
has
had
its
day
we
hope
the
coming
poets
will
happily
combine
the
faultless
diction
of
tennyson
with
the
clear
strong
thought
of
such
masters
as
milton
byron
and
longfellow
the
three
pearls
or
virginity
and
martyrdom
by
a
daughter
of
charity
new
york
the
catholic
publication
society
we
presume
this
book
is
meant
for
a
christmas
present
it
is
admirably
fitted
for
that
purpose
beautifully
printed
and
tastefully
bound
but
the
contents
are
still
better
worth
having
these
were
indeed
great
three
cæcilia
agnes
and
catharine
of
alexandria
no
three
saints
perhaps
could
have
been
more
happily
chosen
by
the
gifted
author
as
models
for
the
young
catholic
women
of
the
day
and
particularly
here
in
america
if
it
be
objected
that
such
heroines
are
not
imitable
the
answer
is
obvious
that
the
virtues
which
led
them
to
become
heroines
are
imitable
by
all
and
again
the
with
which
we
are
familiar
has
many
features
in
common
with
that
amid
which
they
lived
there
is
a
prose
sketch
of
each
saint
followed
by
a
tribute

the
plan
of
the
author
in
this
work
as
is
implied
in
its
title
has
not
been
to
write
a
complete
treatise
on
moral
theology
but
to
furnish
a
compendium
containing
the
points
necessary
for
confessors
in
the
ordinary
discharge
of
their
duties
desirable
as
such
a
book
is
there
is
of
course
a
difficulty
in
compiling
it
arising
from
the
variety
of
sound
opinions
on
many
questions
which
can
not
all
be
given
without
extending
it
beyond
the
limits
which
give
it
its
special
convenience
and
which
opinions
nevertheless
it
is
at
least
expedient
that
every
priest
should
know
this
difficulty
is
one
therefore
which
can
not
be
overcome
and
a
manual
of
this
kind
can
never
entirely
supply
the
place
of
a
larger
work
but
it
nevertheless
has
its
use
and
when
it
is
well
done
can
not
fail
to
be
a
welcome
addition
to
any
theological
library
and
this
book
is
extremely
welcome
for
it
is
extremely
well
done
it
is
very
well
arranged
every
point
of
importance
is
we
believe
given
it
is
clearly
written
it
is
adapted
to
the
times
and
to
this
country
and
which
is
a
great
merit
it
is
by
no
means
dry
there
is
a
little
danger
in
it
on
this
last
account
and
that
is
that
its
superior
attractiveness
may
tend
to
induce
neglect
of
larger
works
and
too
great
confidence
in
statements
which
space
will
not
allow
the
author
to
modify
as
we
have
said
above
one
excellent
feature
of
it
is
the
sound
and
practical
advice
which
it
contains
which
is
almost
as
important
as
the
statement
of
theological
conclusions
or
of
matters
of
law
it
would
be
worth
far
more

its

urged

there
is
no

writer
to

we
would
with
greater
confidence
refer
protestants
who
are
willing
to
learn
the
truth
and
we
would
fain
hope
there
are
very
many
such
as
his
works
relate
to
so
many
supposed
whether
conscious
of
it
or
not

separated

are
very
blind
followers
of

unhesitatingly
the
representations
of
writers
of
the
last
three
centuries
while
faulting
us
for
adhering
to

unbroken
traditions
of

centuries
hence
they
are
accustomed
when
unable
to
reply
to
our
doctrinal
arguments
drawn
from
their
translation
of

holy
scriptures
to
fall
back
on
their
own
version
of

religious

of
the
xvith
century
and
other
historical
events
the
comparative
condition
of
catholic
and
protestant
countries
all
of
which
are
treated
of
at
length
in
these
volumes
at
a
time
when
it
is
sought
to
revive
the
fell
spirit
of
the
defunct
party
it
is
well
to
refresh
our
memories
by
a

its

it
was
really
too
bad
in

to
deny
asylum
to
the

our
reputed
hospitable
shores
after
the
relentless
logic
to
which
he
was
subjected
at
home
when
proving
so
clearly
to
his
own
satisfaction
the
disloyalty
of
catholics
to
spoil
in
fact
his
nice
little
story
that
it
was
the
protestants
and
not
those
hateful
catholics
who
made
maryland
a
refuge
for
fugitives
from
english
persecution
for
sake
and
what
makes
the
matter
all
the
more
aggravating
is
that

some

under
great
obligations
by
the
publication
of
this
valuable
and
beautiful
volume
we
can
scarcely
commend
too
highly
the
evident
fairness
of
the
translation
and
of
the
accompanying
remarks
and
notes
it
could
not
well
be
otherwise
than
that
a

should
have
some
qualifications
to
offer
respecting
statements
of
fact
and
doctrine
such
as
would
naturally
occur
in
these

but
the
catholic
reader
will
be
gratified
to
find
much
that
is
laudatory
and
scarcely
anything
to
which
he
would
object
the

being
for
the
most
part
historical

philological
in

the
naïve
simplicity
of
these

constitutes
one
of
their
chief
charms
and
the
best
answer
to
any
suggestion
of
guile
on
the
part
of
the
writers
the
principles

operations
of
the
jesuits
have
been

to
a
great
extent
are
still
believed
by

that
we
rejoice
at
the
facilities
offered
by
such
writers

for
a

this

and
account
of

showing
what

those
who

are
exalted

the
child
of
an
enslaved
negro
parent
was
born
at

in

instructed
in

by
his
parents
he
offered
himself
to
god
and
became
eminent
for
sanctity
as
a
religious
seeking
always
the
lowest
and
most
humiliating
employments
he
served
for
years
as
a
cook
in
a
convent
already
during
his
lifetime
regarded
as
a
saint
he
was
venerated
by
all
classes

humble
kitchen

his
biographer

nobles
of

who
sought
to
honor
the
saint
and
recommend
themselves
to
his
prayers
the
learned
who
came
for
advice
the
afflicted
who
desired
consolation
the
sick
who
hoped
for
the
recovery
of
their
health
and
the
indigent
who
desired
winning
by
his
wisdom
and
virtues
the
confidence
of
his
brethren
he
was
chosen
guardian
of
the
convent
and
afterwards
vicar
and
master
of
novices
positions
which
he
accepted
with
extreme
reluctance
and
in
which
he
proved
his
great
charity
and
humility
but
the
more
he
sought
to
abase
and
hide
himself
the
greater
the
graces
bestowed
upon
him
though
blessed
with
the
spirit
of
prophecy
the
power
of
performing
miracles
and
the
gift
of
ecstasy
so
great
was
his
humility
that
he
again
turned
to
his
simple
occupation

retained
it

the
title
of
this
work
can
scarcely
fail
to
awaken
an
interest
in
the
youthful
hero
who
gave
his
life
for
his
faith
an
interest
which
is
enhanced
by
the
knowledge
that
this
youth
frail
as
a
girl
and
possessed
of
a
mind
and
rare
sensibility
was
so
filled
with
the
spirit
of
that
he
may
well
be
classed
with
those
of
whose
lives
are
the
glory
of
the
church
and
the
wonder
of
the
world
paul
is
a
name
that
must
be
dear
to
all
catholics
at
all
familiar
with
his
saintly
life
and
death
to
a
heart
overflowing
with
love
for
all
who
had
claims
upon
his
affection
and
charity
for
all
mankind
and
to
those
quick
and
delicate
perceptions
which
retain
all
that
is
good
and
instinctively
reject
all
that
is
evil
was
added
a
fervent
piety
and
ardent
zeal
for
the
glory
of
god
animated
by
these
sentiments
he
sought
the
priesthood
and
soon
turned
his
thoughts
to
the
cloister
pure
and
shining
whither
he
would
go
to
fix
his
dwelling
nearer
while
yet
a
student
in
the
seminary
of
sulpice
he
fell
a
victim
to
the
commune
and
was
permitted
to
win
the
crown
of
martyrdom
which
had
been
the
object
of
his
most
ardent
desires
the
volume
before
us
is
one
which
we
would
especially
recommend
to
our
youthful
readers
who
will
find
in
it
much
that
is
edifying
and
worthy
of
imitation
in
an
age
in
which
respect
for
authority
and
filial
obedience
are
so
much
ignored
we
can
not
place
too
high
a
value
on
the
example
of
paul
seigneret
whose
devotion
and
submission
to
his
parents
were
second
only
to
his
love
of
god
if
a
work
so
admirable
in
most
respects
may
be
criticised
we
would
say
that
it
would
be
quite
as
interesting
if
the
author
had
condensed
the
valuable
materials
of
which
it
is
composed
we
are
aware
of
the
difficulties
under
which
many
translations
from
the
french
are
made
innumerable
things
in
that
versatile
flexible
language
will
bear
many
repetitions
and
much
minutiæ
in
description
which
will
not
admit
of
more
than
the
simple
statement
in
our
unyielding
vernacular
readers
should
therefore
hesitate
in
pronouncing
a
book
dull
because
some
of
the
aroma
escapes
in
the
transition
from
one
medium
of

the
reader
will
rightly
infer
from
the
size
of
this
pastoral
that
it
differs
in
many
respects
from
other
documents
of
the
kind
the
learned
author
has
taken
occasion
to
enter
very
fully
into
the
doctrinal
and
historical
aspects
of
his
subject

for
he
can
not
take
a
step
without
stumbling
on
the
catholic
church
she
is
everywhere
and
everywhere
she
is
to
him
a
cause
of
alarm
so
potent
is
her
influence
growing
to
be
so
cunningly
laid
are
the
plans
by
which
her
policy
is
directed
so
perfect
is
the
organization
and

of
her
forces
so
insidious
are
her
methods
of
procedure
as
he
would
have
us
believe
that
it
is
full
time
all
christendom
should
be
warned
of
the
approaching
danger
she
is
in
his
eyes
an
menace
to
the
civilization
of
the
world
he
at
least
bears
testimony
to
her
power
and
vitality
she
is
not
a
relic
of
a
past
age
she
lives
and
what
is
more
it
does
not
seem
that
she
is
willing
to
die
if
we
consider
the
various
efforts
by
which
men
are
seeking
to
weaken
and
destroy
the
church
we
shall
find
in
them
no
mean
evidence
of
her
divine
strength
and
first
of
all
in
an
age
intellectually
most
active
she
is
the
subject
of
universal
criticism
and
is
cited
before
every
tribunal
of
human
knowledge
to
be
tried
on
an
hundred
different
and
often
contradictory
counts
her
historical
relations
with
the
world
extending
over
eighteen
hundred
years
and
with
christendom
are
minutely
examined
into
by
men
who
shutting
their
eyes
to
the
benefits
which
she
has
conferred
upon
the
human
race
are
eager
to
discover
charges
against
her
she
is
made
responsible
for
the
crimes
of
those
who
called
themselves
catholics
though
she
was
the
first
to
condemn
their
evil
deeds
the
barbarism
the
ignorance
and
the
cruelty
of
the
middle
ages
are
set
to
her
count
when
in
fact
she
was
the
chief
source
of
civilization
of
enlightenment
and
of
mercy
during
that
period
when
she
opposes
the
tyranny
of
kings
she
is
called
the
enemy
of
the
state
when
she
seeks
to
restrain
the
lawlessness
of
the
people
she
is
proclaimed
the
friend
of
tyrants
against
her
dogmas
and
institutions
all
the
sciences
are
brought
to
bear
astronomy
geology
ethnology
and
the
others
not
in
politics
alone
but
in
all
the
physical
sciences
men
in
our
day
stumble
on
the
catholic
church
we
are
told
that
she
is
the
one
great
spiritual
organization
which
is
able
to
resist
and
must
as
a
matter
of
life
and
death
resist
the
progress
of
science
and
modern
civilization
these
men
profess
to
find
innumerable
points
of
collision
between
her
dogmas
and
the
conclusions
of
science
and
are
surprised
when
she
claims
to
understand
her
own
teachings
better
than
they
and
is
not
prepared
to
abandon
all
belief
in
god
the
soul
and
future
life
because
physical
research
has
given
men
a
wider
knowledge
of
the
phenomena
of
matter
now
we
hear
objections
to
her
moral
teaching
that
it
is
too
severe
that
she
imposes
burdens
upon
shoulders
too
heavy
for
human
nature
to
bear
that
she
encourages
asceticism
celibacy
and
all
manner
of
opposed
to
the
spirit
of
the
age
and
of
progress
then
on
the
contrary
that
her
morality
is
lax
that
she
flatters
the
passions
of
men
panders
to
their
sensual
appetites
and
grants
for
gain
permission
to
commit
every
excess
at
one
time
we
are
told
that
her
priests
are
indolent
immoral
ignorant
without
faith
at
another
that
they
are
ceaselessly
active
astute
learned
and
wholly
intent
upon
bringing
all
men
to
their
own
way
of
thinking
now
we
are
informed
that
her
children
can
not
be
loyal
subjects
of
any
government
and
immediately
after
we
hear
that
they
are
so
subservient
so
passively
obedient
that
they
willingly
submit
to
any
master
and
here
we
come
more
immediately
upon
our
subject
for
whereas
gladstone
has
declared
that
the
loyalty
of
catholics
is
not
to
be
trusted
de
laveleye
asserts
that
government
is
the
congenial
government
of
catholic
the
pamphlet
from
which
we
quote
these
words
and
which
we
propose
now
to
examine
has
been
presented
to
the
public
by
the
special
request
of
gladstone
and
has
been
farther
honored
by
him
with
a
prefatory
letter
the
author
it
is
true
takes
a
fling
at
the
church
of
england
and
plainly
intimates
that
in
his
opinion
it
is
little
better
than
the
catholic
church
but
the
could
not
forego
the
opportunity
of
striking
his
enemy
though
he
should
pierce
his
dearest
friend
in
giving
the
blow
he
takes
the
precaution
indeed
to
disclaim
any
concurrence
in
de
unfavorable
estimate
of
the
church
of
england
in
comparison
with
the
other
reformed
the
question
discussed
in
the
pamphlet
before
us
as
its
title
implies
is
the
relative
influence
of
catholicism
and
protestantism
on
the
liberty
and
prosperity
of
nations
and
the
conclusion
which
is
drawn
is
that
the
reformation
is
favorable
to
freedom
and
progress
and
that
the
catholic
church
is
a
hindrance
to
both
this
has
long
been
a
favorite
theme
with
protestants
the
weapon
with
which
they
think
themselves
best
able
to
do
good
battle
in
their
cause
and
doubtless
it
is
employed
in
most
favorable
circumstances
in
an
age
like
ours
in
which
material
progress
is
so
marked
a
feature
that
its
influence
may
be
traced
in
everything
and
in
nothing
more
than
in
the
thoughts
and
philosophies
of
the
men
of
our
day
it
is
worthy
of
remark
that
protestantism
professing
to
be
a
purer
and
more
spiritual
worship
should
have
tended
to
turn
thoughts
almost
exclusively
to
the
worldly
and
temporal
view
of
religion
so
that
it
has
become
the
fashion
to
praise
christianity
not
because
it
makes
men
humble
pure
content
with
little
but
rather
because
its
influence
is
supposed
to
be
of
almost
an
opposite
nature
much
stress
is
laid
upon
the
physical
social
and
mental
superiority
of
christian
nations
to
those
that
are
still
pagan
and
the
inference
implied
if
not
always
expressly
stated
is
that
these
temporal
advantages
are
due
to
the
influence
of
christianity
and
prove
its
truth
and
divine
origin
without
stopping
to
consider
the
question
whether
the
material
and
social
superiority
of
christian
nations
is
to
be
attributed
to
their
religious
faith
we
may
ask
whether
admitting
that
this
is
the
case
it
may
with
propriety
be
adduced
in
proof
of
the
truth
of
the
religion
of
christ
in
the
case
of
individuals
no
one
certainly
would
think
of
arguing
that
prosperity
proves
a
right
faith
or
even
consistent
practice
to
hold
that
wealth
and
success
are
evidences
of
religious
life
whatever
it
may
be
is
certainly
not
christianity
does
the
teaching
of
christ
permit
the
rich
to
lay
the
unction
to
their
souls
that
they
are
favored
children
were
they
his
friends
did
they
flock
around
him
did
they
drink
in
his
words
gladly
if
men
who
claim
to
be
his
disciples
have
deified
worldly
success
and
made
temporal
prosperity
a
sufficient
test
of
the
truth
of
his
religion
they
can
not
plead
any
word
of
his
in
excuse
he
certainly
never
paid
court
to
the
great
or
stooped
to
flatter
the
rich
was
it
not
he
who
said
be
to
you
rich
ye
have
received
your
and
again
is
harder
for
a
rich
man
to
enter
the
kingdom
of
heaven
than
for
a
camel
to
pass
through
the
eye
of
a
did
he
not
take
lazarus
to
his
bosom
when
dives
was
in
hell
are
ye

said
men
shall
revile
you
and
persecute
you
and
shall
say
all
manner
of
evil
against
you
falsely
for
my
sake
rejoice
and
be
exceeding
glad
for
great
is
your
reward
in
heaven
for
so
persecuted
they
the
prophets
which
were
before
the
preaching
of
christ
was
wholly
unworldly
he
sternly
repressed
the
earthly
ambitions
of
his
disciples
and
declared
that
as
the
world
hated
him
it
would
also
hate
those
who
believed
in
him
they
would
be
outcasts
for
his
sake
if
this
life
were
all
they
of
all
men
would
be
most
miserable
indeed
he
rarely
speaks
of
human
happiness
in
the
customary
sense
he
passes
over
what
might
be
said
in
favor
of
this
life
and
brings
out
in
bold
relief
its
vanity
and
unsatisfactoriness
he
draws
no
pictures
of
domestic
bliss
and
says
but
little
of
even
innocent
pleasures
or
those
temporal
blessings
which
are
so
sweet
to
all
and
as
he
taught
that
worldly
prosperity
is
no
evidence
of
favor
he
was
careful
to
correct
the
error
of
those
who
looked
upon
misfortune
as
a
proof
of
guilt
as
in
the
case
of
the
man
born
blind
and
of
those
upon
whom
a
tower
had
fallen
christ
was
poor
his
apostles
were
poor
his
disciples
were
poor
nearly
all
the
christians
of
the
first
ages
were
poor
and
yet
every
day
we
hear
men
talk
as
though
they
considered
poverty
and
christianity
incompatible
this
is
manifestly
the
opinion
of
de
laveleye
his
argument
may
be
stated
in
this
way
england
and
scotland
are
rich
ireland
is
poor
the
protestant
cantons
of
switzerland
are
rich
the
catholic
are
poor
the
united
states
says
de
tocqueville
greater
part
of
the
catholics
are
in
fact
wherever
the
two
religions
exist
together
the
protestants
are
more
active
more
industrious
and
consequently
richer
than
the
catholics
this
is
the
substance
of
what
is
spread
over
a
dozen
pages
of
the
pamphlet
the
conclusion
is
not
difficult
to
draw
protestants
are
richer
than
catholics
and
therefore
better
christians
man
can
serve
two
masters
said
christ
can
not
serve
god
and
on
the
contrary
says
de
laveleye
the
success
with
which
you
worship
mammon
is
the
best
proof
that
you
serve
god
truly
of
course
it
would
be
foreign
to
de
purpose
to
stop
to
inquire
whether
the
poverty
of
ireland
be
due
to
the
catholic
faith
of
her
people
or
to
the
rapacity
and
misgovernment
of
england
whether
that
of
the
catholic
cantons
of
switzerland
might
not
be
accounted
for
by
the
fact
that
they
are
mountainous
with
an
inhospitable
climate
and
a
barren
soil
and
whether
even
de
assertion
that
the
greater
part
of
the
catholics
of
the
united
states
are
poor
might
not
be
satisfactorily
explained
by
stating
that
the
greater
part
of
them
are
emigrants
who
have
recently
landed
upon
these
shores
without
a
superabundance
of
this
goods
he
had
also
good
reasons
while
treating
this
part
of
his
subject
for
not
looking
nearer
home
he
had
in
belgium
under
his
very
eye
one
of
the
most
thrifty
industrious
and
prosperous
peoples
of
europe
and
at
the
same
time
one
of
the
most
catholic
why
did
he
not
compare
the
wealth
of
belgium
with
that
of
sweden
or
denmark
why
did
he
not
say
a
word
about
catholic
france
whose
wealth
and
thrift
can
not
be
denied
he
does
indeed
make
mention
of
two
french
manufacturing
towns
in
which
he
states
on
the
authority
of
audiganne
the
capitalists
are
for
the
most
part
protestants
whilst
the
operatives
are
catholics
though
what
this
has
to
do
with
any
debatable
question
between
catholicism
and
protestantism
is
not
easily
seen
the
assertion
that
the
two
religions
in
the
same
country
the
protestants
are
more
active
more
industrious
more
economical
and
consequently
richer
than
the
catholics
is
not
borne
out
by
facts
a
single
example
will
suffice
to
show
how
rash
de
laveleye
has
been
in
making
so
wide
an
affirmation
the
catholics
of
the
rhine
province
are
universally
acknowledged
to
be
among
the
most
thrifty
and
enterprising
populations
of
prussia
and
are
far
richer
than
for
instance
the
protestants
of
pomerania
it
would
not
be
difficult
by
adopting
de
mode
of
reasoning
to
turn
his
whole
argument
on
this
point
against
his
own
position
whether
or
not
national
wealth
we
might
say
is
evidence
of
orthodox
christian
faith
there
can
be
no
doubt
but
that
the
christian
religion
is
favorable
to
even
the
temporal
interests
of
the
lowest
and
most
degraded
classes
of
society
its
doctrines
on
the
brotherhood
of
the
race
and
the
equality
of
all
before
god
first
inspired
worthy
notions
of
the
dignity
of
man
then
the
sympathy
which
it
created
for
the
poor
the
suffering
and
the
oppressed
naturally
set
men
to
work
to
devise
means
for
the
relief
of
human
misery
it
is
to
its
influence
that
we
must
ascribe
the
abolition
of
slavery
the
elevation
of
woman
and
the
thousand
ministries
which
in
christian
lands
attend
on
the
wretched
and
the
weak
we
must
infer
that
those
nations
in
which
this
influence
is
most
powerful
which
in
other
words
are
most
truly
christian
will
have
in
proportion
to
their
population
the
smallest
class
of
human
beings
cursed
by
the
worst
plague
known
to
modern
civilization
bearing
with
it
as
it
does
a
threefold
degradation
moral
physical
and
social
we
of
course
refer
to
pauperism
now
in
england
from
whose
wealth
de
laveleye
would
infer
the
superiority
of
her
religion
we
find
that
this
pauper
class
compared
with
the
whole
population
is
as
to
whereas
in
ireland
which
is
poor
and
according
to
this
theory
for
that
reason
under
the
ban
of
a
false
religion
there
is
but
pauper
to
inhabitants
in
other
words
pauperism
is
four
times
more
common
in
england
than
in
ireland
now
whether
we
refer
this
fact
to
wealth
or
to
religion
and
in
de
opinion
they
are
correlative
our
conclusion
must
be
either
that
the
influence
of
the
christian
religion
which
necessarily
tends
to
promote
the
temporal
of
the
most
degraded
classes
of
society
is
less
felt
in
england
than
in
ireland
or
else
that
national
wealth
is
hurtful
to
the
interests
of
these
same
classes
and
consequently
opposed
to
the
true
christian
spirit
and
in
either
case
we
have
catholic
ireland
more
fairly
christian
than
protestant
england
we
would
not
have
our
readers
think
for
a
moment
that
we
are
seriously
of
the
opinion
that
our
argument
proves
anything
at
all
we
give
it
merely
as
a
specimen
of
the
way
in
which
the
reasoning
of
this
pamphlet
may
be
turned
against
its
own
conclusions
though
in
fact
we
have
done
the
work
too
respectably
we
can
not
forget
if
de
laveleye
does
that
of
all
sciences
the
social
if
indeed
it
may
be
said
as
yet
to
exist
at
all
is
the
most
complex
and
the
most
difficult
to
master
the
phenomena
which
it
presents
for
observation
are
so
various
so
manifold
and
so
vast
our
means
of
observation
are
so
limited
our
methods
so
unsatisfactory
and
our
prejudices
so
fatal
that
only
the
thoughtless
or
the
rash
will
tread
without
suspicion
or
doubt
upon
ground
so
uncertain
and
so
little
explored
de
laveleye
himself
furnishes
us
an
example
of
how
easily
we
may
go
astray
even
when
the
way
seems
plain
passions
he
writes
anti
religious
prejudice
have
been
too
often
imported
into
the
study
of
these
questions
it
is
time
that
we
should
apply
to
it
the
method
of
observation
and
the
scientific
impartiality
of
the
physiologist
and
the
naturalist
when
the
facts
are
once
established
irrefragable
conclusions
will
follow
it
is
admitted
that
the
scotch
and
irish
are
of
the
same
origin
both
have
become
subject
to
the
english
yoke
until
the
xvith
century
ireland
was
much
more
civilized
than
scotland
during
the
first
part
of
the
middle
ages
the
emerald
isle
was
a
focus
of
civilization
while
scotland
was
still
a
den
of
barbarians
since
the
scotch
have
embraced
the
reformation
they
have
outrun
even
the
ireland
on
the
other
hand
devoted
to
ultramontanism
is
poor
miserable
agitated
by
the
spirit
of
rebellion
and
seems
incapable
of
raising
herself
by
her
own
the
conclusion
which
is
drawn
from
all
this
joined
with
such
other
facts
as
the
late
victories
of
prussia
over
austria
and
france
is
that
is
more
favorable
than
catholicism
to
the
development
of
we
may
as
well
pause
to
examine
this
passage
which
both
with
regard
to
the
statement
of
facts
and
to
the
interpretation
put
upon
them
fairly
represents
the
style
and
method
of
the
pamphlet
before
us
is
admitted
that
the
scotch
and
irish
are
of
the
same
this
is
true
as
here
stated
only
in
the
sense
that
both
are
descended
of
adam
and
hence
it
would
have
been
as
much
to
the
point
to
affirm
that
all
the
nations
of
the
earth
are
of
the
same
origin
the
scots
were
indeed
an
irish
tribe
but
when
they
invaded
caledonia
they
found
it
in
the
possession
of
the
picts
of
whom
whether
they
were
of
celtic
or
teutonic
race
is
still
undecided
the
power
of
the
scots
themselves
declined
in
the
xiith
century
when
scotland
fell
under
the
influence
of
the
conquest
and
the
celtic
population
either
withdrew
towards
the
north
or
by
intermarriage
with
the
conquerors
formed
a
new
type
so
that
the
people
of
that
country
are
even
yet
divided
into
two
great
and
distinct
stocks
differing
from
each
other
in
language
manners
and
dress
the
xvith
century
continues
de
laveleye
was
much
more
civilized
than
scotland
during
the
first
part
of
the
middle
ages
the
emerald
isle
was
a
focus
of
civilization
while
scotland
was
still
a
den
of
now
it
was
precisely
in
those
ages
in
which
ireland
was
focus
of
that
the
catholic
faith
of
her
people
shone
brightest
it
was
then
that
convents
sprang
up
over
the
whole
island
that
the
sweet
songs
of
sacred
psalmody
which
so
touched
the
soul
of
columba
were
heard
in
her
groves
and
vales
that
the
sword
was
sheathed
and
all
her
people
were
smitten
with
the
high
love
of
holy
life
and
were
eager
to
drink
at
the
fountains
of
knowledge
it
was
then
that
she
sent
her
apostles
to
scotland
to
england
to
france
to
germany
to
switzerland
and
to
sicily
nor
did
she
remit
her
efforts
in
behalf
of
civilization
until
the
invading
danes
forced
her
children
to
defend
at
once
their
country
and
their
faith
but
let
us
follow
de

the

embraced

have
outrun

and
seems
incapable
of
raising

by
her
own
we
can
not
think
that
gladstone
had
read
this
passage
when
he
requested
the
author
to
have
his
pamphlet
translated
into
english
for
we
can
not
believe
that
he
is
prepared
to
lay
the
misfortunes
of
ireland
to
the
influence
of
the
catholic
faith
upon
her
people
and
not
to
the
cruelty
and
misgovernment
of
england
the
irish
catholics
are
reproached
with
their
poverty
when
for
two
hundred
years
the
english
government
made
it
a
crime
for
them
to
own
anything
they
are
taunted
with
their
misery
when
for
two
centuries
they
lived
under
a
code
which
placed
them
outside
the
pale
of
humanity
of
which
lord
brougham
said
that
it
was
so
ingeniously
contrived
that
an
irish
catholic
could
not
lift
up
his
hand
without
breaking
it
which
edmund
burke
denounced
as
the
most
proper
machine
ever
invented
by
the
wit
of
man
to
disgrace
a
realm
and
degrade
a
people
and
of
which
montesquieu
wrote
that
it
must
have
been
contrived
by
devils
ought
to
have
been
written
in
blood
and
registered
in
hell
ireland
is
found
fault
with
because
she
is
agitated
with
the
spirit
of
rebellion
when
even
to
think
of
the
wrongs
she
has
suffered
makes
the
blood
to
boil
is
it
astonishing
that
she
should
be
poor
when
england
with
set
purpose
destroyed
her
commerce
and
ruined
her
manufacturing
interests
fostering
at
the
same
time
a
policy
fatal
to
agriculture
the
aim
of
which
it
would
seem
was
to
force
the
irish
to
emigrate
that
the
whole
island
might
be
turned
into
a
grazing
ground
for
the
supply
of
the
english
markets
a
contrast
further
remarks
de
laveleye
in
ireland
between
the
exclusively
catholic
connaught
and
ulster
where
protestantism
prevails
gladstone
certainly
can
not
be
surprised
at
this
contrast
nor
will
he
seek
its
explanation
in
the
baneful
influence
of
the
catholic
church
he
at
least
knows
the
history
of
invasion
of
ireland
he
has
read
of
the
massacres
of
drogheda
and
wexford
he
knows
the
fate
of
the
eighty
thousand
catholic
irishmen
whom
cromwell
drove
into
the
ports
of
munster
and
shipped
like
cattle
to
the
sugar
plantations
of
the
barbadoes
there
to
be
sold
as
slaves
nor
is
he
ignorant
of
what
was
in
store
for
those
irish
catholics
who
were
still
left
of
how
they
were
driven
out
of
ulster
munster
and
leinster
across
the
shannon
into
connaught
that
is
into
the
bogs
and
wild
wastes
of
the
most
desolate
part
of
ireland
there
to
die
of
hunger
or
cold
or
to
survive
as
best
they
might
of
the
catholics
had
perished
the
remainder
were
driven
into
barren
connaught
the
protestants
settled
on
the
rich
lands
of
ulster
munster
and
leinster
and
now
here
comes
good
de
laveleye
to
find
that
connaught
is
poor
because
it
is
catholic
and
ulster
is
rich
because
it
is
protestant
but
we
must
not
forget
scotland
the
scotch
says
de
laveleye
embraced
the
reformed
religion
they
have
outrun
even
the
we
shall
take
no
pains
to
discover
whether
or
in
what
respect
or
how
far
the
scotch
surpass
the
english
the
meaning
of
the
words
which
we
have
just
quoted
is
evidently
this
the
progress
which
the
scotch
have
made
during
the
last
three
centuries
in
wealth
and
the
other
elements
of
material
greatness
must
be
ascribed
to
the
influence
of
the
protestant
religion
to
avoid
even
the
suspicion
of
unfairness
in
discussing
this
part
of
the
subject
we
shall
quote
the
words
of
an
author
who
devoted
much
time
and
research
to
the
study
of
the
character
and
tendencies
of
scotch
presbyterianism
and
whose
dislike
of
the
catholic
church
is
well
known
be
poor
says
buckle
of
vol
ii
describing
the
doctrines
of
the
scotch
divines
of
the
xviith
century
be
poor
dirty
and
hungry
to
pass
through
life
in
misery
and
to
leave
it
with
fear
to
be
plagued
with
boils
and
sores
and
diseases
of
every
kind
to
be
always
sighing
and
groaning
to
have
the
face
streaming
with
tears
and
the
chest
heaving
with
sobs
in
a
word
to
suffer
constant
affliction
and
to
be
tormented
in
all
possible
ways
to
undergo
these
things
was
a
proof
of
goodness
just
as
the
contrary
was
a
proof
of
evil
it
mattered
not
what
a
man
liked
the
mere
fact
of
his
liking
it
made
it
sinful
whatever
was
natural
was
wrong
the
clergy
deprived
the
people
of
their
holidays
their
amusements
their
shows
their
games
and
their
sports
they
repressed
every
appearance
of
joy
they
forbade
all
merriment
they
stopped
all
festivities
they
choked
up
every
avenue
by
which
pleasure
could
enter
and
they
spread
over
the
country
an
universal
gloom
then
truly
did
darkness
sit
on
the
land
men
in
their
daily
actions
and
in
their
every
looks
became
troubled
melancholy
and
ascetic
their
countenance
soured
and
was
downcast
not
only
their
opinions
but
their
gait
their
demeanor
their
voice
their
general
aspect
were
influenced
by
that
deadly
blight
which
nipped
all
that
was
genial
and
warm
the
way
of
life
fell
into
the
sere
and
yellow
leaf
its
tints
gradually
deepened
its
bloom
faded
and
passed
off
its
spring
its
freshness
and
its
beauty
were
gone
joy
and
love
either
disappeared
or
were
forced
to
hide
themselves
in
obscure
corners
until
at
length
the
fairest
and
most
endearing
parts
of
our
nature
being
constantly
repressed
ceased
to
bear
fruit
and
seemed
to
be
withered
into
perpetual
sterility
thus
it
was
that
the
national
character
of
the
scotch
was
in
the
xviith
century
dwarfed
and
they
the
scotch
divines
sought
to
destroy
not
only
human
pleasures
but
human
affections
they
held
that
our
affections
are
necessarily
connected
with
our
lusts
and
that
we
must
therefore
wean
ourselves
from
them
as
earthly
vanities
a
christian
had
no
business
with
love
or
sympathy
he
had
his
own
soul
to
attend
to
and
that
was
enough
for
him
let
him
look
to
himself
on
sunday
in
particular
he
must
never
think
of
benefiting
others
and
the
scotch
clergy
did
not
hesitate
to
teach
the
people
that
on
that
day
it
was
sinful
to
save
a
vessel
in
distress
and
that
it
was
a
proof
of
religion
to
leave
ship
and
crew
to
perish
they
might
go
none
but
their
wives
and
children
would
suffer
and
that
was
nothing
in
comparison
with
breaking
the
sabbath
so
too
did
the
clergy
teach
that
on
no
occasion
must
food
or
shelter
be
given
to
a
starving
man
unless
his
opinions
were
orthodox
what
need
for
him
to
live
indeed
they
taught
that
it
was
a
sin
to
tolerate
his
notions
at
all
and
that
the
proper
course
was
to
visit
him
with
sharp
and
immediate
punishment
going
yet
farther
they
broke
the
domestic
ties
and
set
parents
against
their
offspring
they
taught
the
father
to
smite
the
unbelieving
child
and
to
slay
his
own
boy
sooner
than
to
allow
him
to
propagate
error
as
if
this
were
not
enough
they
tried
to
extirpate
another
affection
even
more
sacred
and
more
devoted
still
they
laid
their
rude
and
merciless
hands
on
the
holiest
passion
of
which
our
nature
is
capable
the
love
of
a
mother
for
her
to
hear
of
such
things
is
enough
to
make
blood
surge
again
and
raise
a
tempest
in
our
inmost
nature
but
to
have
seen
them
to
have
lived
in
the
midst
of
them
and
yet
not
to
have
rebelled
against
them
is
to
us
utterly
inconceivable
and
proves
in
how
complete
a
thraldom
the
scotch
were
held
and
how
thoroughly
their
minds
as
well
as
their
bodies
were
the
xviith
century
which
was
the
golden
age
of
french
literature
and
also
of
the
catholic
church
in
france
threw
almost
total
darkness
over
scotland
which
during
that
period
was
most
completely
under
the
power
of
protestantism
the
clergy
governed
the
nation
they
were
the
only
men
of
real
influence
and
yet
there
was
no
philosophy
no
science
no
poetry
no
literature
worth
reading
the
restoration
says
laing
to
the
union
the
only
author
of
any
eminence
whom
scotland
produced
was
if
the
thrift
and
industry
of
the
scotch
are
due
to
protestantism
to
what
shall
we
ascribe
the
enterprise
and
commerce
of
the
catholic
republics
of
venice
and
genoa
during
the
middle
ages
if
wealth
comes
from
the
reformation
how
shall
we
account
for
that
of
spain
in
the
xvith
and
xviith
centuries
and
if
the
decline
of
spain
has
been
brought
about
by
the
catholic
faith
to
what
cause
shall
we
assign
that
of
holland
who
in
the
xviith
century
ruled
the
seas
and
did
the
carrying
trade
of
europe
de
way
of
accounting
for
the
prosperity
of
nations
is
certainly
simple
but
we
doubt
whether
it
would
satisfy
any
respectable
schoolboy
unfortunately
for
such
as
he
there
is
no
rule
of
three
by
which
social
problems
may
be
solved
race
climate
soil
political
organization
and
many
other
causes
working
through
combinations
must
all
be
considered
if
we
would
understand
the
history
of
material
progress
as
labor
is
the
most
fruitful
cause
of
wealth
there
is
a
necessary
relation
between
national
wealth
and
national
habits
which
are
the
outcome
of
a
thousand
influences
one
of
the
most
powerful
of
which
undoubtedly
is
religious
faith
but
who
does
not
know
that
climate
influences
labor
not
only
by
enervating
or
invigorating
the
laborer
but
also
by
the
effect
it
produces
on
the
regularity
of
his
habits
if
the
italian
loves
the
far
while
the
new
englander
makes
haste
to
grow
rich
as
though
some
demon
whom
gold
could
bribe
pursued
him
shall
we
find
the
secret
of
their
peculiar
characters
in
their
religious
faith
or
in
the
climate
in
which
they
live
or
shall
we
not
rather
seek
it
in
a
combination
of
causes
physical
and
moral
we
have
assuredly
no
thought
of
denying
the
intimate
connection
which
exists
between
faith
and
character
or
between
a
religion
and
its
civilization
we
are
willing
even
to
affirm
that
not
only
the
general
superiority
of
christian
nations
but
their
superior
wealth
also
is
in
great
measure
attributable
to
their
religion
and
now
bidding
adieu
to
de
laveleye
for
a
while
we
propose
to
discuss
this
subject
to
which
we
have
already
alluded
somewhat
more
fully
christianity
certainly
does
not
measure
either
the
greatness
or
the
happiness
of
a
people
by
its
wealth
nor
does
it
take
as
its
ideal
that
state
of
society
in
which
millionaire
is
the
one
sole
and
commerce
is
all
in
all
in
which
the
ledger
lives
and
only
not
all
men
whether
we
consider
individuals
or
associations
of
men
the
catholic
church
does
not
hold
and
can
not
hold
that
material
interests
are
the
highest
to
be
noble
to
be
true
to
be
humble
to
be
pure
is
in
her
view
better
than
to
be
rich
man
is
more
than
money
which
is
good
only
in
so
far
as
it
serves
to
develop
his
higher
nature
whole
aim
of
man
is
to
be
happy
says
bossuet
happiness
where
it
ought
to
be
and
it
is
the
source
of
all
good
but
the
source
of
all
evil
is
to
place
it
where
it
ought
not
to
is
evident
says
thomas
the
happiness
of
man
can
not
lie
in
riches
wealth
is
sought
after
only
as
a
support
of
human
life
it
can
not
be
the
end
of
man
on
the
contrary
man
is
its
the
longing
moreover
for
the
highest
good
is
infinite
the
more
it
is
possessed
the
more
it
is
loved
and
the
more
all
else
is
despised
for
the
more
it
is
possessed
the
better
is
it
known
with
riches
this
is
not
the
case
no
sooner
are
they
ours
than
they
are
despised
or
used
as
means
to
some
other
end
and
this
as
it
shows
their
imperfect
nature
is
proof
that
in
them
the
highest
good
is
not
to
be
if
wealth
is
not
the
highest
good
of
individuals
is
it
of
nations
what
is
the
ideal
of
society
the
study
of
the
laws
which
govern
national
life
must
necessarily
begin
with
this
question
which
all
who
have
dealt
with
the
subject
from
plato
to
comte
and
mill
have
sought
to
answer
it
is
manifest
that
each
attempt
to
solve
this
problem
will
be
based
upon
his
views
on
the
previous
question
what
is
the
ideal
of
man
this
in
turn
will
be
answered
according
to
each
notions
of
the
ideal
of
god
and
here
we
have
the
secret
of
the
phenomenon
which
so
surprised
proudhon
the
necessary
connection
between
religion
and
society
theology
and
politics
is
there
a
god
personal
distinct
from
nature
or
is
nature
the
only
god
and
science
her
prophet
it
is
right
here
at
this
central
point
that
men
are
dividing
it
is
here
we
must
place
ourselves
if
we
would
view
the
two
great
armies
that
in
all
christendom
are
gathering
for
a
supreme
conflict
there
is
a
form
of
infidelity
in
our
day
and
it
is
the
one
into
which
all
unbelief
must
ultimately
resolve
itself
which
starts
with
this
assumption
or
not
there
is
a
god
must
for
ever
remain
unknown
to
it
reasons
in
this
way
whole
subject
belongs
within
the
region
not
only
of
the
unknown
but
of
the
unknowable
it
is
an
insoluble
riddle
and
the
philosophies
and
theologies
which
have
sought
to
unravel
it
if
only
idle
might
deserve
nothing
more
than
contempt
but
they
have
been
the
bane
of
human
thought
have
soured
all
the
sweetness
of
life
and
therefore
ought
to
be
visited
with
the
execration
of
mankind
since
religion
is
a
subject
about
which
nothing
can
be
known
what
is
so
absurd
as
to
spend
time
upon
it
what
so
absurd
as
to
divert
the
thoughts
of
men
from
subjects
in
which
thinking
is
fruitful
to
those
in
which
it
must
for
ever
remain
barren
of
all
except
evil
results
what
so
absurd
as
to
set
them
working
for
a
future
life
of
which
we
can
never
know
whether
it
exists
at
all
when
we
might
at
least
teach
them
how
to
make
the
present
one
worth
having
the
paradise
of
the
future
which
the
prophetic
eye
of
science
can
already
descry
is
the
world
not
it
and
to
seek
to
hasten
its
approach
is
the
highest
and
only
worthy
object
in
as
we
take
it
this
is
the
creed
of
modern
unbelief
to
which
as
yet
few
will
openly
subscribe
but
toward
which
all
its
hundred
conflicting
schools
of
thought
are
moving
few
men
indeed
are
able
to
perceive
the
logical
outcome
of
their
opinions
and
still
fewer
have
the
courage
to
confess
what
they
more
than
half
suspect
this
superstition
is
a
return
to
the
of
paganism
but
under
a
different
aspect
of
old
nature
was
worshipped
as
revealed
to
sense
and
now
as
revealed
to
thought
then
as
beautiful
now
as
true
or
useful
the
first
was
artistic
and
form
was
its
symbol
the
last
is
scientific
and
law
is
its
expression
the
religion
of
humanity
is
only
a
phase
of
this
worship
for
in
it
man
is
considered
not
as
the
child
of
god
but
as
the
product
of
nature
and
now
what
has
this
to
do
with
the
ideal
of
society
or
the
wealth
of
nations
at
the
basis
of
all
social
organization
lies
morality
as
it
is
by
conduct
that
both
individuals
and
nations
are
saved
or
lost
the
history
of
the
human
race
shows
that
religion
and
morality
are
intimately
related
that
there
have
been
good
atheists
does
not
affect
the
truth
of
this
proposition
any
more
than
that
there
have
been
bad
christians
men
are
usually
better
or
worse
than
their
principles
practice
and
profession
rarely
accord
and
this
is
remarked
because
it
ought
not
to
exist
conduct
to
be
rational
should
be
motived
and
consequently
referable
to
certain
general
principles
by
which
it
is
justified
to
be
particular
a
man
who
believes
in
god
the
creator
a
father
as
just
as
he
is
good
has
fundamental
motives
of
action
which
are
wanting
to
the
atheist
the
one
should
seek
to
approve
himself
to
his
heavenly
father
the
other
can
not
go
farther
than
conform
to
the
laws
of
nature
to
the
one
this
life
as
compared
with
that
which
is
to
be
is
of
value
only
as
it
relates
to
it
to
the
other
it
is
all
in
all
and
since
the
ultimate
end
of
society
is
the
welfare
of
the
associated
the
one
will
regard
this
end
from
a
transcendental
point
of
view
taking
in
time
and
eternity
the
other
will
consider
it
merely
with
reference
to
present
state
their
notions
of
life
of
its
ends
aims
and
proper
surroundings
will
be
radically
different
suppose
for
a
moment
that
religious
beliefs
are
mere
dreams
fancies
of
sick
brains
is
it
not
at
once
manifest
that
human
life
is
a
much
poorer
and
sorrier
thing
than
it
is
commonly
thought
to
be
as
the
light
of
heaven
fades
away
do
not
all
things
grow
dark
leaving
us
in
the
shadow
of
death
despairing
or
debauched
sullen
or
frantic
the
dream
the
fond
hope
the
deep
yearning
the
flight
towards
the
infinite
all
become
flat
meaningless
and
unprofitable
men
are
simply
animals
chained
to
this
clod
too
happy
if
the
eye
permitted
them
to
see
it
alone
trouble
danger
and
physical
pain
are
the
only
evils
and
virtue
is
the
prudence
which
enables
us
to
avoid
them
is
not
only
useless
it
is
irrational
our
appetites
are
good
and
ought
to
be
indulged
nothing
of
its
own
nature
is
sinful
excess
alone
is
wrong
all
indulgence
provided
it
hurt
no
one
is
good
nay
it
is
necessary
whoever
denies
any
one
of
his
appetites
the
food
it
craves
cripples
himself
is
maimed
and
incomplete
may
be
a
monk
he
may
be
a
saint
but
a
man
he
is
when
these
views
are
transferred
to
questions
of
political
economy
and
social
organization
they
lead
to
materialistic
and
utilitarian
theories
society
must
be
organized
on
the
basis
of
positivism
the
problem
of
the
future
is
how
to
give
to
the
greatest
number
of
individuals
the
best
opportunities
of
indulgence
the
greatest
amount
of
comfort
with
the
least
amount
of
pain
this
is
the
principle
of
bentham
and
mill
culture
of
course
intellectual
and
æsthetic
as
affording
the
purest
pleasure
must
form
a
feature
of
this
society
but
its
distinctive
characteristic
is
wealth
which
is
both
the
means
and
the
opportunity
of
indulgence
constantly
hear
of
the
evils
of
wealth
says
buckle
of
the
sinfulness
of
loving
money
although
it
is
certain
that
after
the
love
of
knowledge
there
is
no
one
passion
which
has
done
so
much
good
to
mankind
as
the
love
of
we
open
our
eyes
says
strauss
are
honest
enough
to
avow
what
they
show
us
we
must
acknowledge
that
the
entire
activity
and
aspiration
of
the
civilized
nations
of
our
time
is
based
on
views
of
life
which
run
directly
counter
to
those
entertained
by
christ
the
ratio
of
value
between
the
here
and
the
hereafter
is
exactly
reversed
and
this
is
by
no
means
the
result
of
the
merely
luxurious
and
materialistic
tendencies
of
our
age
nor
even
of
its
marvellous
progress
in
technical
and
industrial
all
that
is
best
and
happiest
which
has
been
achieved
by
us
has
been
attainable
only
on
the
basis
of
a
conception
which
regarded
this
present
world
as
by
no
means
despicable
but
rather
as
proper
field
of
labor
as
the
sum
total
of
the
aims
to
which
his
efforts
should
be
directed
if
from
the
force
of
habit
a
certain
proportion
of
workers
in
this
field
still
carry
the
belief
in
an
hereafter
along
with
them
it
is
nevertheless
a
mere
shadow
which
attends
their
footsteps
without
exercising
any
determining
influence
on
their
this
is
the
cosmic
religion
which
is
preached
as
new
faith
the
religion
of
the
this
world
is
all
in
all
let
us
make
the
most
of
it
or
as
the
pagans
of
old
put
it
us
eat
and
drink
for
we
in
its
essence
it
is
sensualism
in
its
manifestations
it
will
be
refined
or
coarse
according
to
the
dispositions
of
the
persons
by
whom
it
is
accepted
now
its
worship
will
be
accompanied
with
music
and
song
and
dance
at
other
times
it
will
sink
to
those
orgies
in
which
man
becomes
only
an
unnatural
animal
let
us
now
turn
to
the
christian
religion
and
consider
its
teachings
in
their
bearing
upon
the
subject
we
are
discussing
they
are
the
very
opposite
of
those
which
we
have
just
read
and
proceed
from
principles
which
are
in
direct
contradiction
to
the
cosmic
philosophy
god
is
the
highest
the
creator
of
all
things
which
are
of
value
only
as
they
relate
to
him
and
are
in
harmony
with
the
laws
of
his
being
the
earth
is
but
the
threshold
of
heaven
or
of
hell
as
the
case
may
be
this
life
is
a
preparation
for
a
future
one
which
is
eternal
and
all
human
interests
whether
individual
or
social
to
be
rightly
understood
must
be
viewed
in
their
relation
to
this
truth
man
is
essentially
a
moral
being
and
duty
which
is
often
in
conflict
with
pleasure
is
his
supreme
law
he
is
under
the
action
of
antagonistic
forces
seeing
the
better
and
approving
it
he
is
drawn
to
love
the
worse
and
to
do
it
thus
becomes
the
condition
of
virtue
and
warfare
with
himself
his
only
assurance
of
victory
he
said
to
all
if
any
one
wishes
to
come
after
me
let
him
deny
himself
take
up
his
cross
every
day
and
follow
wealth
which
is
the
great
slave
and
idol
and
universal
procurator
of
the
senses
though
in
itself
not
evil
is
yet
a
hindrance
to
the
highest
spiritual
life
thou
wouldst
be
perfect
go
sell
what
thou
hast
and
give
it
to
the
poor
and
thou
shall
have
treasure
in
heaven
and
come
and
follow
as
duty
is
the
supreme
law
of
the
individual
it
follows
that
we
must
seek
the
ideal
of
society
in
the
moral
order
to
which
all
other
social
interests
should
be
made
subservient
or
else
they
will
beget
only
an
unbounded
and
lawless
activity
even
education
is
valuable
only
in
so
far
as
it
gives
man
a
deeper
sense
of
his
responsibility
to
god
and
enables
him
more
thoroughly
to
understand
and
perform
his
duty
the
social
problem
as
between
christianity
and
modern
paganism
may
be
stated
in
this
way
is
it
the
end
of
society
to
grow
strong
in
virtue
through
or
to
increase
indefinitely
the
means
and
opportunity
of
indulgence
on
which
side
is
progress
on
which
decline
we
can
not
now
go
farther
into
this
subject
but
before
leaving
it
we
wish
to
quote
the
words
of
fitzjames
stephen
who
will
hardly
be
called
a
christian
on
modern
progress
suspect
he
says
in
many
ways
it
has
been
a
progress
from
strength
to
weakness
that
people
are
more
sensitive
less
enterprising
and
ambitious
less
earnestly
desirous
to
get
what
they
want
and
more
afraid
of
pain
both
for
themselves
and
others
than
they
used
to
be
if
this
should
be
so
it
appears
to
me
that
all
other
gains
whether
in
wealth
knowledge
or
humanity
afford
no
equivalent
strength
in
all
its
forms
is
life
and
manhood
to
be
less
strong
is
to
be
less
a
man
whatever
else
you
may
be
this
suspicion
prevents
me
for
one
from
feeling
any
enthusiasm
about
progress
but
i
do
not
undertake
to
say
it
is
well
i
do
not
myself
see
that
our
mechanical
inventions
have
increased
the
general
vigor
of
characters
though
they
have
no
doubt
increased
enormously
our
control
over
nature
the
greater
part
of
our
humanity
appears
to
me
to
be
a
mere
increase
of
nervous
sensibility
in
which
i
feel
no
satisfaction
at
the
general
superiority
and
even
the
greater
wealth
of
christian
nations
as
compared
with
others
we
would
attribute
in
great
part
at
least
to
the
influence
of
their
religious
faith
to
which
they
owe
their
sentiments
on
the
dignity
and
sacredness
of
human
nature
in
itself
apart
from
surroundings
on
the
substantial
equality
of
all
men
before
god
which
tends
to
produce
as
its
counterpart
the
equality
of
all
before
the
law
thus
leading
to
the
abolition
of
slavery
the
elevation
of
woman
and
the
protection
of
childhood
to
it
also
they
owe
their
ideas
on
the
family
which
in
its
constitutive
christian
elements
lies
at
the
very
foundation
of
our
civilization
to
christianity
they
owe
the
principles
of
universal
charity
and
compassion
which
have
revolutionized
the
relations
of
social
life
and
finally
to
it
they
are
indebted
for
the
rehabilitation
of
labor
the
chief
source
of
wealth
which
the
pagan
nations
looked
upon
as
degrading
can
not
say
writes
herodotus
the
greeks
get
their
contempt
for
labor
from
the
egyptians
for
i
find
the
same
prejudice
among
the
thracians
the
scythians
the
persians
and
the
germans
says
tacitus
can
not
bear
to
remain
quiet
but
they
love
to
be
idle
they
hold
it
base
and
unworthy
of
them
to
acquire
by
their
sweat
what
they
can
purchase
with
their
in
the
same
way
the
gauls
looked
upon
labor
with
contempt
we
shall
have
to
take
up
de
pamphlet
again
for
the
present
we
lay
it
aside
with
the
following
remark
if
we
should
grant
to
the
fullest
all
that
is
here
said
about
the
greater
wealth
and
material
prosperity
of
protestant
as
compared
with
catholic
nations
what
are
we
thence
to
conclude
shall
we
say
that
the
greed
of
gain
which
is
so
marked
a
feature
in
the
populations
of
england
and
the
united
states
is
at
once
the
result
and
proof
of
true
christian
faith
may
it
not
be
barely
possible
that
the
value
of
material
progress
is
exaggerated
is
there
not
danger
lest
when
man
shall
have
made
matter
the
willing
slave
of
all
his
passions
he
should
find
that
he
has
become
the
creature
of
this
slave
however
this
may
be
might
not
a
catholic
find
some
consolation
in
the
words
of
holy
writ
the
angel
that
spoke
in

me

chapter
xii
the
baronet
is
a
case
of
mistaken
identity
the
night
was
wild
and
stormy
the
wind
had
risen
to
a
hurricane
and
drove
the
rain
in
face
as
he
walked
home
through
the
park
it
was
driving
the
grass
in
cold
ripples
over
the
fields
and
tossing
the
trees
about
as
if
it
would
break
them
columns
of
black
clouds
were
trooping
over
the
sky
and
the
moon
broke
through
them
as
if
she
were
pursued
by
the
wind
and
flying
for
her
life
raymond
was
a
long
time
getting
to
the
cottage
great
gusts
swept
up
from
the
valley
staggering
him
so
that
he
had
to
stand
every
now
and
then
and
cling
to
a
tree
until
it
passed
then
the
rain
beat
against
his
face
so
that
he
could
hardly
profit
by
the
fitful
gleams
of
the
moon
as
she
dipped
in
and
out
of
the
clouds
he
was
dripping
wet
when
he
got
to
his
own
door
and
let
himself
in
with
his
he
took
off
his
coat
hanging
it
in
the
hall
and
lighted
his
candle
franceline
had
left
it
close
to
his
hand
with
a
match
mechanically
he
walked
up
to
his
room
and
began
to
divest
himself
of
his
drenched
clothing
he
hardly
noticed
that
they
were
soaking
and
that
he
was
wet
through
he
was
flushed
and
heated
as
if
he
had
come
straight
from
a
hot
room
how
the
blast
roared
and
shrieked
beating
against
the
cottage
till
it
rocked
like
a
ship
at
sea
and
trying
the
windows
till
they
cracked
and
groaned
it
whistled
through
the
chinks
so
that
the
flimsy
red
curtain
fluttered
as
if
the
window
had
been
open
raymond
pushed
it
aside
and
opened
the
shutters
and
looked
out
the
night
was
inky
black
above
and
below
except
when
a
star
flickered
in
and
out
like
a
swept
by
the
wind
and
showed
the
river
like
a
bit
of
steel
as
it
flashed
and
quivered
under
the
pelting
rain
and
hurried
away
into
blacker
distance
all
this
angry
roar
was
better
than
music
to
raymond
the
fury
of
the
elements
seemed
to
comfort
him
nature
was
in
sympathy
with
him
it
was
kind
of
her
to
be
angry
and
disturbed
when
he
was
so
distraught
nature
had
more
heart
than
his
these
were
talking
over
his
despair
quietly
enough
now
mocking
him
very
likely
but
the
world
around
was
shaken
and
tossed
and
driven
in
sympathy
with
him
a
great
gust
came
swelling
up
from
the
river
growing
louder
and
heavier
as
it
drew
near
till
gathering
itself
up
like
a
mountainous
wave
it
burst
with
a
crash
against
the
cottage
de
la
bourbonias
leaped
back
and
with
a
sudden
impulse
of
terror
flew
out
into
the
landing
and
knocked
at
door
but
the
sonorous
breathing
of
the
old
servant
reassured
him
that
all
was
right
there
and
in
the
room
beyond
it
was
pitch
dark
but
the
reflection
from
his
own
open
door
showed
standing
wide
open
he
listened
but
everything
was
silent
there
he
stole
noiselessly
back
to
his
room
and
closed
the
door
without
disturbing
either
of
the
sleepers
the
storm
had
reached
its
crisis
and
gradually
subsided
after
this
until
the
wind
was
spent
and
died
away
in
long
low
wails
behind
the
woods
and
the
moon
drifted
above
the
tattered
clouds
that
were
sweeping
toward
the
east
leaving
a
portion
of
the
sky
stainless
with
stars
flashing
out
brightly
raymond
put
out
his
candle
and
went
to
bed
under
ordinary
circumstances
he
would
probably
have
paid
for
the
adventure
by
an
attack
of
bronchitis
or
rheumatic
fever
but
the
mental
fever
that
had
been
devouring
him
warded
off
every
other
and
when
he
came
down
next
morning
he
was
neither
ill
nor
ailing
franceline
like
her
had
slept
through
the
storm
and
they
were
quite
astonished
to
hear
what
an
awful
night
it
had
been
and
to
see
the
fields
strewn
with
great
branches
in
every
direction
gates
torn
up
and
other
evidences
of
the
work
but
they
saw
no
traces
of
another
tempest
that
was
raging
still
in
a
human
soul
close
by
them
nothing
betrayed
its
existence
and
they
guessed
nothing
so
securely
does
this
living
wall
of
flesh
screen
the
secrets
of
the
spirit
from
every
outside
gaze
passions
rise
up
in
hearts
whose
pulses
we
fondly
imagine
close
and
familiar
to
us
as
our
own
and
the
winds
blow
and
the
waves
run
high
and
make
wild
havoc
there
turning
life
into
darkness
and
despair
or
at
the
whisper
of
the
voice
illuminating
it
as
suddenly
with
a
flood
of
sunshine
and
we
are
blind
and
deaf
to
these
things
and
remain
as
stranger
to
our
and
mercifully
so
many
a
battle
is
won
that
would
have
been
lost
if
it
had
not
been
fought
alone
we
hinder
each
other
by
our
pity
perhaps
as
often
as
we
help
sir
simon
had
very
little
appetite
for
his
breakfast
when
he
came
down
next
morning
sick
at
heart
after
a
sleepless
night
and
found
the
pleasant
meal
thoughtfully
spread
in
his
favorite
room
the
library
with
the
table
wheeled
close
to
his
on
the
right
side
of
the
hearth
it
all
looked
the
very
picture
of
comfort
and
refinement
and
elegance
but
the
cup
was
doubly
poisoned
to
him
now
last
adventure
had
added
the
last
drop
of
bitterness
to
it
he
could
not
think
of
raymond
without
a
poignant
pang
he
suspected
and
he
was
right
that
raymond
was
thinking
of
him
wondering
whether
it
was
really
all
over
with
him
this
time
and
whether
he
was
bankrupt
and
his
estate
in
the
fangs
of
the
creditors
and
whether
he
was
driving
away
from
the
court
never
to
see
it
again
or
whether
once
more
for
the
hundred
and
time
he
had
weathered
the
storm
and
was
still
afloat
even
though
on
a
raft
raymond
would
have
scarcely
believed
it
if
any
one
had
informed
him
that
he
had
been
the
instrument
of
destroying
sir
one
chance
of
escape
that
he
had
snatched
the
last
plank
from
him
in
his
shipwreck
it
may
have
been
an
imaginary
one
and
sir
simon
after
the
fashion
of
drowning
men
may
have
been
catching
at
a
straw
but
now
that
it
was
snatched
from
him
he
was
more
than
ever
convinced
that
it
had
been
a
solid
plank
which
would
have
borne
him
securely
to
shore
he
did
not
ask
himself
whether
plover
would
have
entered
into
his
plans
and
whether
supposing
he
found
it
his
interest
to
do
so
his
fortune
would
have
been
equal
to
the
demand
he
only
considered
what
might
have
been
and
what
was
not
and
thinking
of
this
his
indulgent
pity
for
de
la
bourbonais
shrank
in
the
bitter
reflection
that
he
had
ruined
not
only
himself
but
his
friend
irretrievably
they
were
pretty
much
in
the
same
boat
now
sir
delusions
had
cleared
away
wonderfully
within
the
last
hours
he
drew
no
comparison
to
his
own
advantage
between
actual
position
and
his
own
if
de
la
bourbonais
was
a
thief
in
the
technical
sense
of
the
word
he
sir
simon
was
a
bankrupt
and
a
bankrupt
under
certain
conditions
may
mean
a
swindler
he
had
been
a
swindler
for
years
his
life
had
been
a
sham
these
twenty
years
and
he
had
not
the
excuse
of
circumstances
to
fall
back
on
he
had
been
dishonest
from
extravagance
and
sheer
want
of
principle
it
first
and
afford
it
had
been
his
theory
and
he
had
lived
up
to
it
and
now
the
day
of
reckoning
had
arrived
many
a
time
he
had
said
half
in
jest
that
raymond
was
the
richer
man
of
the
two
raymond
used
to
laugh
mildly
at
the
notion
but
it
was
true
an
ambitious
extravagant
man
and
a
contented
poor
one
are
pretty
much
on
a
level
the
one
possesses
everything
he
does
not
want
the
other
wants
everything
he
does
not
possess
the
unprincipled
and
the
struggling
man
were
then
on
an
equality
of
fortune
or
rather
the
latter
was
virtually
the
wealthier
of
the
two
but
now
the
distinction
was
washed
out
the
proud
consciousness
of
unstained
honor
and
innermost
which
had
hitherto
sustained
de
la
bourbonais
and
sweetened
the
cup
of
poverty
to
him
was
gone
he
was
a
blighted
man
who
could
never
hold
up
his
head
again
amongst
his
god
what
delirium
possessed
him
how
could
he
be
so
infatuated
so
stupid
broke
out
sir
simon
giving
vent
to
what
was
passing
through
his
mind
he
added
presently
was
not
accountable
i
believe
grief
and
anxiety
drove
him
then
he
recalled
that
answer
of
that
had
sounded
so
untrue
at
the
time
i
can
fancy
myself
giving
way
if
the
temptation
took
a
certain
form
and
if
i
were
left
to
my
own
the
words
sounded
now
like
a
prophecy
of
course
we
all
know
that
according
to
the
canons
of
poetical
justice
the
brave
suffering
man
should
have
been
in
some
unexpected
way
succored
in
his
extremity
that
some
angel
in
visible
or
invisible
form
should
have
been
sent
to
hold
him
up
from
slipping
into
the
pit
that
despair
had
dug
for
him
and
that
on
the
other
hand
the
wicked
spendthrift
should
have
been
left
to
eat
the
bread
of
righteous
retribution
and
suffer
the
just
penalty
of
his
evil
behavior
but
poetical
justice
and
the
facts
of
real
life
do
not
always
agree
sir
simon
after
walking
up
and
down
the
library
chewing
the
cud
of
bitter
thoughts
until
he
was
sick
of
it
bethought
himself
that
as
breakfast
was
there
he
might
as
well
try
and
eat
it
before
it
got
cold
so
he
sat
down
and
poured
out
his
coffee
and
then
by
mere
force
of
habit
and
without
the
faintest
glimmer
of
interest
began
to
turn
over
the
bundle
of
letters
piled
up
beside
the
on
the
table
one
after
another
was
tossed
away
contemptuously
the
duns
might
cry
till
they
were
hoarse
now
he
need
not
trouble
about
them
he
would
be
at
least
that
much
the
gainer
by
his
disgrace
suddenly
his
eye
lighted
on
an
envelope
that
was
not
addressed
in
the
hand
of
the
race
of
duns
but
in
clide
de
and
it
bore
the
london
postmark
the
thought
of
clide
generally
produced
on
sir
simon
the
effect
of
a
needle
run
through
the
left
side
but
he
took
up
this
letter
with
a
strange
thrill
of
expectation
he
opened
it
and
a
change
came
over
his
face
it
was
not
joy
it
was
too
uncertain
too
tremulous
yet
for
that
he
must
read
it
again
before
he
trusted
to
the
first
impression
he
must
make
sure
that
he
was
not
dreaming
and
the
words
that
danced
like
a
before
his
eyes
were
real
written
with
real
ink
on
real
paper
at
last
he
dropped
the
letter
and
a
heartier
prayer
than
he
had
uttered
since
his
childhood
came
from
him
god
i
thank
thee
i
have
not
deserved
this
mercy
but
i
will
try
to
deserve
he
buried
his
face
in
his
hands
and
remained
mute
and
motionless
for
some
minutes
then
starting
up
as
if
suddenly
remembering
something
he
pulled
out
his
watch
it
wanted
five
minutes
of
ten
the
law
officer
and
the
jew
creditor
were
to
start
by
the
train
that
left
charing
cross
at
a
quarter
past
eleven
sir
simon
rang
the
bell
sharply
a
horse
and
ride
as
fast
as
you
can
with
this
to
the
telegraph
he
said
to
his
valet
who
answered
the
summons
the
moment
you
come
back
get
ready
to
be
off
with
me
to
london
by
the
the
telegram
prepared
simpson
to
see
his
client
appear
at
his
office
at
two
that
afternoon
and
in
obedience
to
its
directions
the
jew
was
there
to
meet
him
clide
de
winton
had
seen
simpson
the
day
before
and
given
him
full
authority
to
settle
the
dullerton
debts
so
as
to
set
sir
simon
harness
free
he
had
only
arrived
in
london
that
very
morning
and
it
was
the
merest
accident
that
led
him
to
call
on
the
family
lawyer
who
was
also
the
best
friend
on
his
way
from
the
station
to
his
hotel
simpson
was
discretion
itself
and
one
of
the
attributes
of
that
virtue
is
to
know
when
to
be
indiscreet
first
inquiry
was
for
sir
simon
with
a
view
which
the
astute
lawyer
did
not
see
through
of
leading
up
to
inquiries
about
other
friends
at
dullerton
whereupon
simpson
bolted
out
the
whole
truth
told
him
of
the
position
the
long
arrears
of
debt
that
had
come
against
him
and
which
were
to
culminate
in
bankruptcy
within
hours
it
was
as
if
the
sky
had
fallen
on
clide
or
the
ground
opened
under
his
feet
goodness
i
am
come
in
time
he
exclaimed
and
there
and
then
sat
down
and
wrote
to
sir
simon
telling
him
that
proceedings
were
stopped
and
that
he
clide
took
them
in
his
own
hands
this
is
what
you
call
being
a
friend
said
the
young
man
as
he
and
the
baronet
left
office
together
the
one
with
a
lightened
purse
the
other
with
a
heart
considerably
more
so
think
of
your
letting
things
go
to
such
lengths
and
that
if
i
had
been
a
day
later
it
would
have
been
all
over
dear
boy
what
can
i
say
to
you
how
can
i
ever
repay
you
forgiving
me
lived
long
enough
to
find
out
a
secret
or
two
one
is
that
it
requires
a
very
noble
soul
to
forgive
a
man
a
money
obligation
and
that
there
is
a
deal
more
generosity
in
accepting
than
in
conferring
it
so
if
you
pick
a
quarrel
with
me
after
this
and
turn
your
back
on
me
we
are
quits
is
it
a
bargain
he
held
out
his
hand
laughing
sir
simon
wrung
it
till
the
pressure
made
clide
wince
this
was
his
only
answer
and
the
only
sentimental
passage
the
occasion
gave
rise
to
between
them
it
was
more
than
a
month
since
clide
had
left
petersburg
although
the
season
was
still
at
its
height
there
and
engagement
was
to
have
lasted
until
the
end
of
it
this
had
however
been
brought
to
an
abrupt
and
tragic
close
she
had
acted
for
six
weeks
with
unprecedented
success
every
night
was
a
fresh
triumph
and
nothing
was
talked
of
in
the
and
clubs
but
the
wonders
of
her
voice
the
intense
reality
of
her
acting
and
her
rare
beauty
ophelia
was
considered
her
grandest
part
she
was
playing
it
one
evening
to
a
crowded
house
in
the
presence
of
the
imperial
family
and
the
whole
court
and
seemed
wrought
up
to
a
pitch
of
power
and
pathos
that
surpassed
her
finest
preceding
efforts
she
was
singing
the
mad
scene
with
melting
tenderness
the
house
was
breathless
hanging
enraptured
on
every
note
when
suddenly
the
voice
ceased
the
prima
donna
cast
a
wild
look
on
every
side
of
her
and
then
with
a
shriek
too
terribly
real
to
be
within
the
compass
of
art
she
flung
her
arms
over
her
head
and
clasping
her
hands
fell
insensible
to
the
ground
never
did
any
witness
so
dramatic
a
scene
the
spectators
rose
in
a
body
from
the
pit
to
the
gallery
shouting
to
know
what
had
happened
and
calling
for
help
help
was
near
enough
a
man
in
plain
clothes
sprang
from
behind
the
scenes
and
lifted
the
prostrate
ophelia
before
any
of
the
actors
could
interfere
there
were
several
medical
men
among
the
audience
and
they
rushed
in
a
body
to
offer
their
services
it
was
feared
for
a
moment
that
she
was
dead
but
the
doctors
soon
pronounced
it
to
be
only
a
swoon
though
it
was
impossible
to
say
what
might
follow
on
the
awakening
the
emperor
sent
one
of
his
chamberlains
to
hear
and
see
what
was
going
on
in
the
and
inquire
if
the
piece
was
to
be
continued
whereupon
the
luckless
manager
flew
out
before
the
footlights
and
falling
on
his
knees
under
the
imperial
box
as
if
he
saw
the
knout
suspended
over
his
shoulders
called
heaven
to
witness
that
he
was
a
loyal
subject
and
an
innocent
man
and
flung
himself
on
the
imperial
clemency
the
prima
donna
had
been
seized
with
illness
and
the
opera
could
not
be
finished
that
night
the
czar
waved
his
clemency
to
the
terrified
man
who
withdrew
invoking
all
manner
of
benedictions
on
the
mercy
of
the
father
of
all
the
russians
and
flew
to
hear
what
the
doctors
were
now
saying
of
ophelia
they
were
saying
that
she
was
acting
out
her
part
as
it
had
never
yet
been
acted
with
the
perfection
of
nature
she
was
raving
mad
this
was
not
proclaimed
at
once
the
affair
was
hushed
up
for
a
few
days
and
kept
out
of
the
newspapers
so
that
clide
only
heard
it
accidentally
at
the
club
where
he
happened
to
lounge
in
a
week
after
the
occurrence
he
sent
stanton
off
at
once
to
make
inquiries
at
the
house
where
isabel
lodged
but
they
could
tell
nothing
of
her
there
she
had
been
taken
away
the
day
after
her
seizure
at
the
opera
and
had
left
no
address
clide
went
straight
to
the
lawyer
and
asked
if
there
was
no
way
of
getting
access
to
her
through
the
police
of
learning
at
least
whether
she
was
in
an
asylum
for
his
first
idea
on
hearing
that
she
had
been
taken
away
was
that
they
had
placed
her
in
some
such
confinement
the
lawyer
agreed
with
him
that
this
was
most
probable
but
did
not
promise
much
help
in
verifying
the
supposition
he
seemed
honestly
willing
to
do
what
he
could
in
the
matter
but
repeated
the
old
warning
that
little
could
be
done
where
imperial
favor
stood
in
the
way
it
was
highly
probable
that
the
czar
would
still
show
his
benevolence
toward
the
beautiful
artist
by
screening
her
and
the
fact
of
her
being
mad
in
hope
of
her
being
able
to
return
and
complete
her
engagement
after
rest
and
medical
treatment
his
position
now
seemed
worse
to
clide
than
it
had
ever
been
the
thought
of
being
in
a
a
prey
to
the
most
awful
visitation
that
humanity
is
subject
to
rudely
perhaps
cruelly
treated
by
coarse
pitiless
menials
was
so
horrible
that
at
first
it
haunted
him
till
he
almost
fancied
he
was
going
mad
himself
the
image
of
the
bright
young
creature
who
had
first
stirred
the
pulses
of
his
foolish
heart
was
for
ever
before
his
eyes
as
she
appeared
to
him
that
day
how
long
ago
it
seemed
in
the
midst
of
the
splendors
of
niagara
and
that
he
took
her
for
a
sprite
some
lovely
creature
of
the
water
and
the
sunlight
he
remembered
with
a
new
sense
of
its
meaning
the
strange
air
she
wore
walking
on
as
if
half
unconscious
he
had
wondered
if
she
were
not
walking
in
her
sleep
was
it
a
phase
of
the
cruel
malady
that
was
then
showing
itself
and
if
so
was
she
not
perhaps
blameless
from
the
beginning
this
blight
that
had
fallen
on
her
in
her
brilliant
maturity
might
have
been
germinating
then
making
strange
havoc
in
her
mind
and
impelling
her
character
her
destiny
to
fearful
and
fantastic
issues
some
weeks
passed
while
clide
was
a
prey
to
these
harrowing
thoughts
when
he
received
a
letter
from
the
lawyer
saying
he
had
something
to
communicate
to
him
of
interest
is
not
good
news
he
said
as
the
englishman
entered
his
office
it
is
better
than
complete
suspense
the
signora
is
not
in
petersburg
all
our
researches
were
useless
from
the
first
as
she
was
carried
off
almost
immediately
to
a
lunatic
asylum
in
she
is
there
still
and
she
has
been
admirably
treated
with
the
utmost
skill
and
care
so
much
so
that
it
is
expected
she
will
be
quite
restored
after
a
short
period
of
did
you
ascertain
all
this
inquired
clide
a
client
of
mine
who
has
been
for
some
time
a
patient
of
the
establishment
he
left
it
very
recently
and
came
to
see
me
on
his
return
and
in
talking
over
the
place
and
its
inmates
he
described
one
in
a
way
that
excited
my
suspicions
i
wrote
to
the
director
and
put
a
few
questions
cautiously
and
the
answer
leaves
me
no
doubt
but
that
the
patient
whom
my
client
saw
there
a
few
days
before
his
departure
was
the
lady
who
interests
you
hear
who
accompanied
her
to
saxony
client
saw
a
person
walking
in
the
grounds
with
her
once
and
from
the
description
it
must
be
the
same
who
travelled
with
her
from
england
her
uncle
in
fact
a
man
with
hair
and
very
white
teeth
an
my
client
called
murmured
clide
description
does
not
tally
with
my
recollection
of
the
man
who
called
himself
her
uncle
except
that
he
had
a
forbidding
countenance
and
was
of
medium
height
he
had
a
quantity
of
gray
almost
white
hair
and
not
a
sound
tooth
in
his
white
hair
may
turn
black
and
new
teeth
may
be
made
to
replace
lost
ones
observed
the
lawyer
would
not
be
put
off
the
scent
by
changes
of
that
sort
if
the
main
points
true
i
must
start
at
once
then
for
saxony
and
try
and
see
for
myself
i
shall
have
difficulty
in
gaining
the
confidence
of
the
directors
of
the
place
i
dare
say
can
you
help
me
by
a
letter
of
introduction
to
any
of
them
i
am
well
known
to
the
principal
medical
man
by
name
and
i
will
give
you
a
line
to
him
with
he
wrote
it
and
shook
hands
with
his
client
and
wished
him
clide
travelled
without
halting
till
he
drove
up
to
the
door
of
the
asylum
his
letter
procured
him
admittance
at
once
to
the
private
room
of
the
medical
man
and
what
was
of
greater
importance
it
inclined
the
latter
to
credit
his
otherwise
almost
incredible
story
when
clide
had
told
all
he
deemed
necessary
the
doctor
informed
him
that
the
patient
whom
he
believed
to
be
his
wife
had
already
left
the
house
and
the
country
altogether
she
had
spent
three
full
weeks
under
his
care
and
was
then
well
enough
to
be
removed
and
had
by
his
advice
been
taken
home
for
the
benefit
of
native
air
it
was
just
three
days
since
she
had
left
saxony
the
doctor
could
give
no
idea
as
to
where
she
had
gone
beyond
that
she
had
returned
to
england
he
knew
nothing
of
the
whereabouts
of
her
native
place
there
and
her
uncle
had
left
no
clue
to
his
future
residence
clide
was
once
more
baffled
by
fate
and
found
himself
again
in
a
in
answer
to
his
inquiries
concerning
the
nature
of
disease
the
medical
man
said
that
it
was
hereditary
and
therefore
beyond
the
likelihood
not
to
say
possibility
of
radical
cure
this
it
seemed
was
the
third
attack
from
which
she
had
suffered
the
first
was
in
early
girlhood
before
the
patient
was
eighteen
the
second
somewhat
later
and
of
much
longer
duration
it
had
lasted
six
years
her
uncle
said
then
came
the
third
crisis
which
owing
perhaps
to
the
improved
general
health
of
the
patient
but
more
probably
to
the
more
judicious
and
enlightened
treatment
she
had
met
with
had
passed
off
very
rapidly
it
was
however
far
from
being
a
cure
it
was
at
best
but
a
recovery
and
the
disease
might
at
any
moment
show
itself
again
in
a
more
obstinate
and
dangerous
form
perfect
quiet
freedom
from
excitement
whether
mental
or
physical
were
indispensable
conditions
for
preserving
her
against
another
crisis
it
was
needless
to
add
after
this
that
the
career
of
an
actress
was
the
most
fatal
one
the
unfortunate
young
woman
could
have
adopted
but
in
that
no
doubt
she
was
more
passive
than
active
with
this
new
light
on
his
path
clide
hastened
his
return
to
england
farther
than
ever
it
seemed
from
his
end
and
laden
with
a
heavier
burden
than
when
he
set
out
march
march
was
still
the
command
that
sounded
in
his
ears
driving
him
on
and
on
like
the
wandering
jew
and
never
letting
him
get
nearer
the
goal
he
had
not
the
faintest
idea
of
native
place
she
had
told
him
she
was
scotch
and
her
name
said
so
too
though
she
was
perfectly
free
from
the
native
accent
which
marked
her
speech
so
strongly
but
what
did
that
prove
either
way
was
cameron
her
name
or
prendergast
his
he
had
taken
a
new
name
in
his
travels
and
so
had
she
still
feeble
as
the
thread
was
it
was
the
only
one
he
had
to
guide
him
so
he
started
for
scotland
as
soon
as
he
landed
in
england
having
previously
taken
the
precaution
to
acquaint
the
police
in
london
with
his
present
purpose
and
what
had
led
him
to
it
if
isabel
were
sufficiently
recovered
to
appear
again
in
public
it
was
probable
that
the
brutal
man
who
was
in
reality
no
more
than
her
would
have
made
some
engagement
for
her
with
a
manager
and
she
might
at
this
moment
be
singing
her
brain
away
for
his
benefit
in
some
provincial
theatre
it
was
clear
he
shunned
the
publicity
of
the
london
stage
clide
thought
of
these
things
as
he
tramped
over
the
purple
heather
of
the
highlands
following
now
one
mirage
now
another
and
his
heart
swelled
within
him
and
smote
him
for
his
angry
and
vindictive
feelings
toward
isabel
and
tears
that
were
no
disgrace
to
his
manhood
forced
themselves
from
his
eyes
poor
child
she
was
not
to
blame
then
for
wrecking
his
life
and
coming
again
like
an
evil
genius
to
thrust
him
back
into
the
abyss
just
as
he
had
climbed
to
safety
beckoned
onwards
and
upwards
by
another
angel
form
she
was
a
victim
herself
and
had
perhaps
never
meant
to
deceive
or
betray
him
but
had
loved
him
with
her
mad
untutored
heart
as
well
as
she
knew
how
the
winter
days
dragged
on
drearily
as
he
went
from
place
to
place
in
scotland
and
found
no
trace
of
the
missing
one
heard
nothing
that
gave
him
any
hopes
of
finding
her
the
police
were
equally
unsuccessful
in
london
stanton
had
gone
back
there
very
much
against
his
inclination
but
clide
insisted
that
he
would
be
of
more
use
in
the
busy
streets
keeping
his
keen
eyes
open
than
following
his
master
in
his
wanderings
up
and
down
scotland
one
dark
afternoon
the
valet
was
walking
along
regent
street
when
he
stopped
to
look
at
some
prints
in
a
the
gas
was
lighted
and
streamed
in
a
brilliant
blaze
over
the
tenors
and
that
were
piling
the
agony
on
the
backs
of
various
operatic
songs
stanton
was
considering
them
and
mentally
commenting
on
the
manner
of
ladies
and
gentlemen
who
found
it
good
to
spend
their
lives
making
faces
and
throwing
themselves
into
contortions
that
appeared
to
him
equally
painful
and
ridiculous
when
he
noticed
a
lady
inside
the
shop
engaged
in
choosing
some
music
she
was
dressed
in
black
and
he
only
caught
a
glimpse
of
her
side
face
through
her
veil
but
the
glimpse
made
him
start
he
watched
her
take
the
roll
of
music
from
the
shopman
secure
it
in
a
little
leathern
case
and
then
turn
to
leave
the
shop
she
walked
out
leisurely
but
the
moment
she
opened
the
door
she
quickened
her
pace
almost
to
a
run
and
before
stanton
knew
where
he
was
she
had
rushed
into
the
middle
of
the
street
he
hastened
after
her
but
a
string
of
carriages
and
cabs
intervened
and
blocked
the
street
for
some
moments
as
soon
as
it
was
clear
he
saw
the
slight
figure
in
black
stepping
into
an
omnibus
he
hailed
it
gesticulating
and
hallooing
frantically
but
the
conductor
with
the
spirit
of
contradiction
peculiar
to
conductors
kept
his
head
persistently
turned
the
other
way
stanton
tore
after
him
waving
his
umbrella
and
whistling
all
to
no
purpose
until
at
last
he
stopped
for
want
of
breath
at
the
same
moment
the
omnibus
pulled
up
to
let
some
travellers
alight
he
overtook
it
this
time
and
got
in
the
great
machine
went
thundering
on
its
way
and
there
opposite
to
him
sat
the
lady
in
black
his
wife
he
was
ready
to
swear
if
she
was
in
the
land
of
the
living
he
saw
the
features
very
indistinctly
but
well
enough
to
be
certain
of
their
identity
the
height
and
contour
were
the
same
and
so
was
the
mass
of
jet
black
hair
that
escaped
in
thick
plaits
from
under
the
small
black
bonnet
then
there
was
the
conclusive
fact
of
his
having
seen
her
in
a
this
clinched
the
matter
for
stanton
the
omnibus
stopped
the
lady
got
out
ran
to
the
corner
of
the
street
and
waited
for
another
to
come
up
and
jumped
into
it
stanton
meanwhile
following
her
like
her
shadow
she
saw
it
and
he
saw
that
she
saw
it
and
that
she
was
frightened
and
trying
to
get
away
from
him
why
should
she
do
so
if
she
were
not
afraid
of
being
recognized
he
was
not
a
gentleman
and
could
see
no
reason
for
an
unprotected
young
woman
being
frightened
at
a
man
looking
fixedly
at
her
and
pursuing
her
unless
she
had
a
guilty
conscience
he
sat
as
near
as
he
could
to
her
in
the
omnibus
and
when
it
pulled
up
to
let
her
down
he
got
down
she
hurried
up
a
small
quiet
street
off
tottenham
court
road
and
on
reaching
a
small
house
flew
up
the
steps
and
pulled
violently
at
the
bell
stanton
was
beside
her
in
an
instant
me
but
i
know
you
i
mean
to
do
you
any
only
to
tell
you
that
stanton
valet
you
are
my
wife
he
was
excited
but
respectful
in
his
manner
are
mistaken
replied
the
lady
shrinking
into
the
doorway
know
nothing
about
you
i
never
heard
of
clide
and
not
married
stanton
was
of
course
prepared
for
the
denial
and
showed
no
sign
of
surprise
or
incredulity
but
in
spite
of
himself
her
tone
of
assurance
staggered
him
a
little
he
could
not
say
whether
the
sound
of
the
voice
resembled
that
of
de
winton
its
echoes
had
lingered
very
faintly
in
his
memory
and
so
many
other
voices
and
sounds
had
swept
over
it
during
the
intervening
years
that
he
could
not
the
least
affirm
whether
the
voice
he
had
just
heard
was
hers
or
not
before
he
had
found
any
answer
to
this
question
footsteps
were
audible
pattering
on
the
tarpauling
of
the
narrow
entry
and
a
opened
the
door
the
lady
passed
quickly
in
stanton
followed
her
must
leave
me
she
said
turning
on
him
is
my
house
and
if
you
give
any
more
annoyance
he
will
have
you
taken
into
she
spoke
in
a
loud
voice
and
as
she
ceased
the
parlor
door
was
opened
and
a
gentleman
in
a
velveteen
coat
and
slippers
came
forward
with
a
newspaper
in
his
hand
the
matter
what
is
all
this
about
he
demanded
blandly
coming
forward
to
reconnoitre
stanton
who
did
not
look
at
all
bland
but
grim
and
resolute
like
a
man
who
had
conquered
his
footing
on
the
premises
and
meant
to
hold
it
i
am
stanton
valet
this
lady
knows
me
well
if
you
i
never
saw
him
in
my
life
i
know
who
clide
is
protested
the
young
lady
in
a
tremor
man
has
annoyed
me
all
the
way
home
send
him
away
must
speak
to
you
sir
said
stanton
stoutly
can
not
leave
the
house
walk
in
said
the
gentleman
waving
his
newspaper
towards
the
open
parlor
you
my
dear
go
and
take
off
your
sir
be
good
enough
to
state
your
business
he
began
when
the
door
was
closed
business
with
you
sir
but
with
your
daughter
if
she
is
your
daughter
said
stanton
thing
is
certain
my
wife
there
no
use
in
her
denying
it
and
the
best
thing
she
can
do
is
to
speak
out
to
her
and
forgive
her
poor
thing
and
do
the
best
he
can
for
her
which
will
be
better
than
what
that
uncle
of
hers
been
for
her
her
about
everywhere
and
driving
the
poor
creature
crazy
what
got
to
say
sir
and
i
see
as
sense
and
the
occupant
of
the
velveteen
slippers
listened
to
this
speech
with
eyes
that
grew
rounder
and
rounder
as
it
proceeded
then
he
threw
back
his
head
and
laughed
till
the
tears
ran
down
his
cheeks
good
man
some
mistake
mistaken
my
daughter
for
somebody
else
she
never
was
married
in
her
life
and
she
has
no
uncle
that
ever
i
heard
of
ha
ha
ha
the
best
joke
i
ever
heard
in
my
life
me
it
no
joke
at
all
protested
stanton
nettled
and
resolved
not
to
be
shaken
by
the
ring
of
honesty
there
was
in
the
laugh
know
the
person
that
calls
himself
her
uncle
but
i
do
sir
mayhap
you
are
duped
by
the
rascal
yourself
but
all
come
out
now
i
have
it
all
in
the
palm
of
my
and
he
opened
that
capacious
member
and
closed
it
again
significantly
daughter
must
either
come
away
with
me
quietly
or
call
the
police
and
have
her
taken
off
whether
she
will
or
no
tell
you
man
you
are
under
some
preposterous
mistake
said
the
gentleman
his
blandness
all
gone
and
his
choler
rising
name
is
honey
i
am
a
clerk
in
h
bank
and
my
daughter
eliza
jane
honey
has
never
left
me
since
she
was
born
she
is
an
artist
a
singer
and
gives
lessons
in
singing
in
some
of
the
first
houses
in
london
singing
lessons
ha
just
so
i
know
it
all
said
stanton
his
mouth
compressing
itself
in
a
saturnine
smile
know
it
all
and
i
tell
you
i
leave
this
without
your
insolence
what
do
you
mean
better
be
gone
this
instant
or
call
the
police
and
give
into
custody
sir
try
it
it
answer
said
stanton
imperturbable
only
make
more
trouble
the
poor
thing
has
enough
on
her
already
and
not
the
one
to
make
more
for
her
if
you
call
in
the
police
something
slapping
his
waistcoat
pocket
settle
at
once
which
of
us
was
to
be
took
before
honey
could
say
anything
in
answer
to
this
a
voice
came
carrolling
down
the
stairs
singing
some
air
from
an
opera
rich
with
trills
and
it
is
the
very
voice
the
very
tune
her
sing
in
the
at
lanwold
exclaimed
stanton
the
singer
dashed
into
the
room
but
broke
off
in
her
trills
on
seeing
him
you
are
not
gone
papa
who
is
he
dear
he
is
either
a
madman
or
or
worse
said
her
father
the
most
extraordinary
thing
i
ever
heard
in
my
life
out
and
you
fear
do
you
any
my
master
it
not
for
all
the
money
worth
nobody
knows
the
sum
spent
on
them
detectives
already
to
try
and
catch
you
and
it
speaks
badly
for
the
lot
to
say
not
caught
you
long
ago
but
you
be
afraid
of
me
urged
stanton
making
his
voice
as
mild
as
he
could
eliza
answer
was
a
peal
of
laughter
should
i
be
afraid
of
you
i
never
laid
my
eyes
on
you
before
or
you
on
me
you
mistake
me
for
somebody
else
i
tell
you
i
never
heard
of
clide
and
i
am
certain
he
never
heard
of
me
the
idea
of
your
insisting
that
his
wife
and
she
laughed
again
but
there
was
a
nervous
twitch
about
her
mouth
and
stanton
saw
it
like
as
two
peas
in
a
pod
was
his
emphatic
remark
as
he
deliberately
scanned
her
face
there
was
no
denying
the
resemblance
indeed
the
face
was
fuller
the
features
more
developed
but
the
interval
of
years
would
explain
that
at
my
hand
you
see
i
have
no
ask
me
a
few
questions
you
will
find
out
the
blunder
at
once
if
you
only
try
she
said
stanton
paused
for
a
moment
as
if
trying
to
recall
something
that
might
serve
as
a
test
it
he
said
looking
up
with
a
look
of
triumph
your
mouth
and
let
me
look
into
it
he
advanced
towards
her
expecting
instant
compliance
but
miss
honey
rushed
behind
her
father
with
a
cry
of
terror
and
disgust
the
movement
was
perfectly
natural
under
the
circumstances
but
stanton
saw
it
in
the
light
of
his
own
suspicions
i
guessed
as
much
he
said
drawing
away
and
speaking
in
a
quiet
tone
of
regret
was
sure
of
it
well
you
give
me
no
choice
i
know
my
dooty
to
a
lady
but
i
know
my
dooty
to
my
master
he
went
toward
the
window
intending
to
throw
it
up
and
call
for
a
policeman
cried
honey
do
you
expect
to
find
in
my
mouth
sir
is
known
to
her
and
to
me
was
the
oracular
reply
she
has
nothing
in
it
as
can
convict
her
she
be
afraid
to
let
me
look
into
honey
turned
aside
touched
his
forehead
with
his
forefinger
and
pointed
with
the
thumb
toward
stanton
after
this
rapid
and
significant
little
pantomime
he
said
aloud
to
his
daughter
dear
perhaps
it
is
as
well
to
let
the
man
have
his
way
he
will
see
that
there
is
nothing
to
see
come
and
gratify
his
singular
the
girl
was
now
too
frightened
to
see
the
ludicrous
side
of
the
performance
she
advanced
gravely
to
the
table
on
which
a
threw
a
strong
clear
light
and
opened
her
mouth
stanton
came
and
peered
into
it
to
lift
the
left
side
as
wide
open
as
you
can
it
was
the
third
tooth
from
the
back
of
her
left
she
did
as
he
desired
but
after
looking
closely
all
round
he
could
see
nothing
but
two
fine
pearly
rows
of
teeth
all
ivory
without
the
smallest
glimmer
of
gold
or
silver
to
attest
the
presence
of
even
an
unsound
one
beg
your
pardon
i
beg
a
thousand
pardons
sir
i
find
made
a
great
mistake
behaved
shameful
rude
to
you
and
the
young
lady
but
i
hope
forgive
me
i
was
only
doing
my
dooty
to
my
master
sorrier
than
i
can
say
for
my
mistake
both
father
and
daughter
were
too
thankful
to
be
rid
of
him
to
withhold
their
free
and
unconditional
pardon
they
even
went
the
length
of
regretting
that
he
had
had
so
much
trouble
and
such
an
unpleasant
adventure
all
to
no
purpose
and
cordially
wished
him
better
success
next
time
as
he
withdrew
profusely
apologizing
he
must
be
an
escaped
lunatic
cried
the
young
lady
as
the
closed
on
stanton
dare
say
they
took
me
for
a
maniac
and
indeed
no
wonder
was
reflection
as
he
heard
a
peal
of
laughter
through
the
window
the
adventure
left
nevertheless
an
uneasy
feeling
on
his
mind
and
the
next
day
he
called
on
peckitt
the
dentist
and
related
it
peckitt
had
not
seen
the
wearer
of
the
silver
tooth
since
the
time
he
had
attended
her
before
her
departure
for
berlin
but
he
had
seen
her
uncle
and
made
an
entire
set
of
false
teeth
for
him
he
took
the
liberty
on
first
seeing
him
of
inquiring
for
the
young
lady
but
her
uncle
answered
curtly
that
she
was
in
no
need
of
dental
services
at
present
and
turned
off
the
subject
by
some
irrelevant
remark
peckitt
of
course
took
the
hint
and
never
reverted
to
it
this
was
all
he
had
to
tell
stanton
but
he
did
not
confirm
the
certainty
as
to
the
of
miss
honey
on
the
grounds
of
the
absence
of
the
silver
tooth
it
was
he
thought
improbable
that
his
patient
should
have
parted
with
that
odd
appendage
and
that
if
so
she
should
have
gone
to
a
strange
dentist
to
have
it
replaced
by
an
ordinary
tooth
but
either
of
these
alternatives
was
possible
this
was
all
the
information
that
stanton
had
for
his
master
when
the
latter
returned
from
his
bootless
search
in
scotland
on
the
following
day
sir
simon
harness
came
to
london
and
heard
of
the
strange
adventure
he
was
inclined
to
attach
more
importance
to
it
than
clide
apparently
did
this
eliza
jane
honey
should
not
have
been
isabel
he
said
some
one
like
her
the
same
whom
you
saw
at
dieppe
clide
shook
his
head
could
not
be
deceived
though
stanton
might
this
miss
honey
too
was
fuller
in
the
face
and
altogether
a
more
robust
person
than
isabel
as
stanton
remembers
her
now
after
the
terrible
attack
that
she
has
suffered
lately
it
is
much
more
likely
that
she
is
worn
and
thin
poor
child
is
true
still
there
remains
the
coincidence
of
the
splendid
voice
and
of
her
being
an
artist
if
i
were
you
i
would
not
rest
till
i
saw
her
would
only
make
assurance
doubly
sure
stanton
has
startled
me
over
and
over
again
for
nothing
every
pair
of
black
eyes
and
bright
complexion
that
he
sees
gives
him
a
turn
as
he
says
and
sets
him
off
on
the
chase
no
the
woman
i
saw
at
dieppe
was
my
wife
i
am
as
sure
of
that
as
of
my
own
identity
i
did
not
get
near
enough
to
her
to
say
you
my
wife
but
i
am
as
certain
of
it
as
if
i
he
promised
however
to
satisfy
sir
simon
that
he
would
go
to
tottenham
court
and
see
miss
honey
while
tongue
was
engaged
on
this
absorbing
topic
he
was
mentally
reverting
to
another
subject
which
was
scarcely
less
absorbing
and
which
was
closer
to
his
heart
his
love
for
franceline
had
not
abated
one
atom
of
its
ardor
since
absence
and
a
far
more
impassable
gulf
had
parted
him
from
her
her
image
reigned
supreme
in
his
heart
still
and
accompanied
him
in
his
waking
and
sleeping
thoughts
he
felt
no
compunction
for
this
his
conscience
tendered
full
and
unflinching
allegiance
to
the
letter
of
the
moral
law
but
it
was
in
bondage
to
none
of
those
finer
spiritual
tenets
that
ruled
and
influenced
franceline
he
would
have
cut
off
his
right
hand
rather
than
outrage
her
memory
by
so
much
as
an
unworthy
thought
but
he
gave
his
heart
full
freedom
to
retain
and
foster
its
love
for
her
he
had
not
her
clear
spiritual
insight
to
discern
the
sinfulness
of
this
any
more
than
he
had
her
deep
inward
strength
to
enable
him
to
crush
the
sin
out
of
his
heart
even
if
he
had
tried
which
he
did
not
it
was
his
misfortune
not
his
fault
that
his
love
for
her
was
unlawful
nothing
could
make
it
guilty
that
was
in
his
own
power
and
the
purity
of
its
object
was
its
best
protection
she
was
an
angel
and
could
only
be
worshipped
with
the
reverent
love
that
one
of
her
own
pure
kindred
spirits
might
accept
without
offence
or
contamination
such
was
code
and
if
he
wanted
any
internal
proof
of
his
own
loyalty
to
sanction
it
he
had
it
in
the
shape
of
many
sighs
prayers
he
called
them
and
perhaps
they
were
that
franceline
might
not
suffer
on
his
account
but
might
forget
him
and
be
happy
after
a
time
with
some
worthier
husband
he
had
been
quite
honest
when
he
sighed
these
sighs
at
least
he
thought
he
was
yet
when
sir
simon
meaning
to
console
him
and
make
things
smooth
and
comfortable
assured
him
emphatically
that
they
had
been
both
happily
mistaken
in
the
nature
of
feelings
and
then
basely
and
cruelly
insinuated
that
ponsonby
anwyll
was
in
a
fair
way
to
make
her
a
good
husband
by
and
by
clide
felt
a
pang
more
acute
than
any
he
had
yet
experienced
this
is
often
the
case
with
us
we
never
know
how
much
insincerity
there
is
in
the
best
of
our
prayers
the
ones
until
we
are
threatened
with
the
grant
of
them
sir
simon
said
nothing
about
the
stolen
ring
his
friendship
for
raymond
partook
of
that
strong
personal
feeling
which
made
any
dishonor
in
its
object
touch
him
like
a
personal
stain
he
could
not
bear
even
to
admit
it
to
himself
that
his
ideal
was
destroyed
de
la
bourbonais
had
been
his
ideal
of
truth
of
manly
independence
of
everything
that
was
noble
simple
and
good
there
are
many
intervals
in
the
scale
that
separates
the
ordinary
honest
man
from
the
ideal
man
of
honor
sir
simon
could
count
several
of
the
former
class
but
he
knew
but
one
of
the
higher
type
he
had
never
known
any
one
whom
he
would
have
placed
on
the
same
pinnacle
of
unsullied
impregnable
honor
with
raymond
now
that
he
had
fallen
it
seemed
as
if
the
very
stronghold
of
sir
own
faith
had
surrendered
he
could
disbelieve
everything
he
could
doubt
everybody
where
was
truth
to
be
found
who
was
to
be
trusted
since
raymond
de
la
bourbonais
had
failed
but
meantime
he
would
screen
him
as
long
as
he
could
he
would
not
be
the
first
to
speak
of
his
disgrace
to
any
one
he
told
clide
how
raymond
had
lost
for
him
a
considerable
sum
of
money
recently
through
the
dishonesty
of
a
bank
and
how
he
had
borne
the
loss
with
the
most
incredible
philosophy
because
just
then
it
so
happened
he
did
not
want
the
money
but
since
then
health
had
become
very
delicate
and
she
was
ordered
to
a
warm
climate
and
these
few
hundreds
would
have
enabled
him
to
take
her
there
and
her
father
was
now
bitterly
lamenting
the
loss
clide
was
all
excitement
in
a
moment
now
you
can
supply
them
he
cried
rather
let
me
do
it
through
you
i
must
not
of
course
appear
but
it
will
be
something
to
know
i
am
of
use
to
her
to
both
of
them
you
can
easily
manage
it
can
you
not
de
la
bourbonais
would
make
no
difficulty
in
accepting
the
service
from
as
will
have
it
there
is
a
coldness
between
us
at
present
said
sir
simon
little
tiff
that
will
blow
off
after
a
while
but
meanwhile
bourbonais
is
as
unapproachable
as
a
porcupine
as
proud
as
lucifer
at
any
time
and
i
fear
there
is
no
one
but
myself
from
whom
he
would
accept
a
service
of
the
not
langrove
manage
it
they
seemed
on
affectionate
terms
said
clide
no
oh
no
that
would
never
do
said
sir
simon
quickly
see
any
one
at
dullerton
but
myself
who
could
attempt
but
some
one
must
since
you
say
you
argued
clide
with
impatience
do
you
return
to
the
court
did
not
mean
to
return
just
yet
a
while
you
see
i
have
a
great
deal
of
business
to
look
to
of
a
pleasant
sort
thanks
to
you
my
dear
boy
but
still
imperative
and
admitting
of
no
delay
i
possibly
leave
town
until
it
has
been
should
have
thought
simpson
might
have
attended
to
it
i
suppose
you
mean
legal
matters
said
the
young
man
with
some
asperity
he
could
not
understand
sir
being
hindered
by
mere
business
from
sparing
a
day
in
a
case
of
such
emergency
and
for
such
a
friend
it
was
unlike
him
to
be
selfish
and
this
was
downright
heartlessness
to
be
sure
exclaimed
the
baronet
jubilantly
starting
up
and
seizing
his
hat
will
be
off
and
see
him
this
minute
simpson
is
sure
to
hit
on
some
device
never
at
a
loss
for
to
be
continued
the
story
of
evangeline
in
prose
i
spare
you
saying
too
often
i
fear
i
successfully
imitate
the
in
speaking
prose
without
knowing
it
aye
at
the
very
moment
when
i
think
to
woo
the
muse
most
ardently
but
great
is
the
courage
demanded
to
announce
a
purpose
to
be
prosaic
prosy
it
may
be
with
premeditation
especially
true
is
this
when
as
in
the
case
before
me
the
subject
itself
ranks
high
as
poetry
longfellow
in
some
of
his
later
writings
may
seem
to
aim
at
or
does
perhaps
unconsciously
catch
that
tone
made
fashionable
by
the
younger
victorian
songsters
which
sets
the
poet
apart
as
a
being
differing
from
his
kind
and
makes
him
as
the
english
does
in
a
golden
golden
stars
but
in
his
of
our
american
wordsworth
touches
with
sympathetic
finger
the
chords
that
vibrate
with
feeling
in
common
hearts
this
is
the
lyre
he
sweeps
with
a
magic
sweetness
not
excelled
by
any
modern
english
poet
is
a
poem
of
the
hearth
and
domestic
love
that
is
to
say
though
it
is
true
the
heroine
and
her
betrothed
never
come
together
in
one
happy
home
the
feelings
described
are
such
as
might
without
shame
beat
tenderly
in
any
christian
breast
such
too
as
any
husband
might
wish
his
wife
to
feel
how
different
is
this
from
the
fierce
passion
a
surrender
to
the
lower
nature
which
burns
and
writhes
and
contorts
itself
in
heroines
one
is
christian
love
the
other
the
pagan
brutishness
of
messalina
it
may
be
said
indeed
with
truth
that
in
portraying
a
catholic
maiden
and
a
catholic
community
longfellow
has
with
the
intuition
of
genius
reflected
in
this
poem
the
purity
and
fidelity
blessed
by
the
church
in
the
love
it
sanctions
his
admirers
therefore
can
not
but
regret
that
debasing
contact
with
the
new
school
of
the
realism
which
in
such
an
one
of
his
later
poems
for
example
as
that
entitled
draws
him
to
the
worship
of
the
and
of
the
lucretian
venus
the
love
of
evangeline
is
that
which
is
affected
by
refined
women
in
every
society
humble
though
the
heroine
be
the
other
strips
the
veil
from
weakness
the
charm
of
the
poem
is
that
it
transports
us
to
a
scene
arcadian
idyllic
yet
which
impresses
us
with
its
truthfulness
to
nature
this
is
not
acadia
only
but
arcadia
the
nymphs
and
the
shepherds
and
shepherdesses
and
the
god
pan
with
his
oaten
reed
put
off
the
stage
costumes
worn
by
them
in
the
pages
of
virgil
or
on
the
canvas
of
watteau
and
lo
here
they
are
in
real
life
in
the
village
of
grand
pré
evangeline
milking
the
kine
gabriel
lajeunesse
and
michael
the
fiddler
and
the
level
acadian
meadows
walled
in
by
their
dykes
from
the
turmoil
of
war
that
shook
the
world
all
around
them
the
picture
is
truthful
but
truthful
rather
by
the
effect
of
the
bold
touches
that
befit
the
artist
and
poet
than
in
the
multitude
of
details
some
more
prosaic
some
not
so
charming
which
massed
together
make
up
the
more
faithful
portrait
of
the
historian
the
description
of
scenery
in
the
poem
confuses
the
natural
features
of
two
and
different
sections
of
the
country
the
evangeline
of
grand
pré
is
not
in
all
respects
the
acadian
girl
of
charlevoix
or
murdock
the
history
of
men
and
manners
on
the
shores
of
the
basin
of
mines
as
depicted
by
the
poet
is
sadly
at
variance
with
the
angry
tumultuous
suspicious
annals
of
those
settlements
strange
as
it
may
seem
the
poem
is
truer
of
the
acadians
of
again
living
in
nova
scotia
than
of
their
expatriated
forefathers
remoteness
of
time
did
not
mean
in
their
case
a
golden
age
of
peace
and
plenty
far
from
it
it
meant
ceaseless
war
on
the
borders
the
threats
and
intrigues
of
a
deadly
national
feud
the
overhanging
doom
of
exile
military
tyranny
and
constant
english
espionage
now
absolute
peace
reigns
within
the
townships
still
peopled
by
their
descendants
and
the
acadian
peasant
and
village
maiden
cling
in
silence
and
undisturbed
to
the
manners
their
fathers
brought
from
normandy
nearly
three
centuries
ago
the
first
few
lines
give
the
coloring
to
the
whole
poem
they
are
the
setting
within
which
are
grouped
the
characters
is
the
forest
primeval
the
murmuring
pines
and
the
hemlocks
bearded
with
moss
and
in
garments
green
indistinct
in
the
twilight
stand
druids
of
eld
or
from
its
rocky
caverns
the
neighboring
ocean
speaks
and
in
accents
disconsolate
answers
the
wail
of
the
this
is
the
refrain
running
through
the
poem
like
the
of
the
rose
of
through
yet
the
picture
conveyed
to
the
mind
is
that
of
the
atlantic
coast
of
acadia
or
nova
scotia
not
of
the
basin
of
mines
where
evangeline
dwelt
with
her
people
the
natural
features
of
the
two
sections
of
country
are
strikingly
diverse
on
the
east
coast
of
nova
scotia
rises
a
line
of
granitic
and
other
cliffs
sterile
vast
jagged
opposing
their
giant
shoulders
to
the
roaring
surges
of
the
atlantic
on
the
hills
behind
the
pines
and
hemlocks
rustle
and
murmur
in
answer
to
the
waves
this
is
the
and
the
neighboring
but
on
the
west
coast
is
quite
another
scene
the
basin
of
mines
is
an
inland
gulf
of
an
inland
sea
the
bay
of
fundy
here
the
granite
rocks
and
murmuring
pines
give
place
to
red
and
overflowed
marshes
and
here
is
horton
or
grand
pré
it
is
separated
by
the
whole
breadth
of
the
peninsula
of
nova
scotia
from
the
ocean
the
from
the
mighty
atlantic
which
on
the
happy
valley
but
from
their
station
descended
are
in
reality
the
fogs
of
the
bay
of
fundy
shut
out
by
the
north
mountain
instead
of
the
long
swell
of
the
atlantic
breaking
on
a
rocky
coast
we
have
in
the
basin
of
mines
numerous
small
rivers
running
through
an
alluvial
country
with
high
left
bare
by
the
receding
tide
this
last
feature
of
the
scene
is
correctly
described
by
the
poet
but
it
must
be
borne
in
mind
that
it
is
not
united
with
the
natural
features
of
the
east
coast
the
acadians
never
in
fact
affected
the
atlantic
they
sailed
shuddering
past
its
frowning
and
wintry
walls
and
doubling
cape
sable
beat
up
the
bay
of
fundy
to
where
the
sheltered
basins
of
port
royal
and
mines
invited
an
entrance
from
the
west
for
over
one
hundred
years
after
the
founding
of
port
royal
the
atlantic
coast
of
acadia
remained
a
waste
a
at
canseau
on
the
north
a
sort
of
to
and
from
the
great
fortress
of
louisburg
and
a
few
scattered
houses
and
clearings
near
la
first
settlement
alone
broke
the
monotonous
silence
of
the
wilderness
the
indian
hunter
tracking
the
moose
over
the
frozen
surface
of
the
snow
and
some
irish
and
new
england
fishermen
in
chebucto
bay
divided
the
rest
of
the
country
between
them
it
was
not
until
that
cornwallis
landed
his
colonists
at
halifax
and
made
the
first
solid
footing
on
the
atlantic
coast
but
for
generations
previously
in
the
rich
valley
of
the
river
of
port
royal
and
along
the
fertile
banks
of
the
streams
flowing
into
the
basin
of
mines
the
gaspereau
the
canard
and
the
pereau
the
thrifty
acadians
spread
their
villages
built
their
churches
and
were
married
and
buried
by
the
good
recollect
fathers
i
was
a
lad
scarce
emancipated
from
college
when
i
first
visited
those
scenes
i
remember
well
my
emotion
when
i
drew
my
eyes
away
from
the
landscape
and
turning
to
my
companion
father
k
asked
him
if
there
were
any
remains
of
the
old
village
of
grand
pré
to
my
youthful
imagination
evangeline
was
as
real
as
the
people
about
me
father
k
was
the
priest
stationed
at
kentville
about
ten
miles
distant
from
grand
pré
and
the
gaspereau
river
which
were
included
in
his
mission
he
was
an
old
family
friend
and
i
was
going
to
spend
the
summer
vacation
with
him
we
were
driving
from
windsor
through
horton
and
wolfville
to
kentville
passing
on
our
road
through
all
the
scenes
described
in
the
poem
i
have
often
visited
that
part
of
the
country
since
then
but
never
has
it
made
such
an
impression
on
me
the
then
rolled
between
windsor
and
kentville
and
something
of
the
rural
simplicity
congenial
with
the
poem
was
still
felt
to
be
around
one
last
year
i
rode
by
rail
over
the
same
ground
and
later
on
another
line
of
railroad
to
truro
and
thence
around
the
basin
of
mines
on
the
north
through
cumberland
but
my
feelings
had
changed
or
the
whistle
of
the
locomotive
was
a
sound
alien
to
the
memories
of
those
green
meadows
and
intersecting
dykes
evangeline
was
no
longer
a
being
to
be
loved
but
a
beautiful
figment
of
the
brain
i
know
to
this
day
whether
father
k
was
quizzing
me
or
was
loath
to
shatter
my
boyish
romance
when
he
told
me
that
there
were
some
old
ruins
which
were
said
to
be
the
home
of
evangeline
it
is
probable
he
was
having
a
quiet
joke
at
my
expense
as
he
was
noted
for
his
fund
of
humor
which
i
learned
better
to
appreciate
in
later
years
poor
father
k
he
was
a
splendid
type
of
the
old
irish
missionary
priest
an
admirable
latinist
well
read
in
english
literature
especially
the
queen
anne
poets
hearty
jovial
and
could
tell
a
story
that
would
set
the
table
in
a
roar
and
withal
no
priest
worked
harder
than
he
did
in
his
wide
and
laborious
mission
or
was
a
more
friend
of
the
poor
and
afflicted
he
is
since
dead
during
the
month
or
six
weeks
i
spent
with
father
k
that
part
of
the
country
became
quite
familiar
to
me
by
means
of
his
numerous
drives
on
parish
duties
when
i
usually
accompanied
him
often
as
the
shades
of
the
summer
evening
descended
have
i
watched
the
mists
across
the
basin
shrouding
the
bluff
front
of
cape
blomidon
as
it
is
more
commonly
called
by
the
at
other
times
we
drove
up
the
north
mountain
where
the
pitched
their
tents
and
standing
there
i
have
looked
down
upon
the
distant
glittering
waters
of
the
bay
of
fundy
on
one
occasion
we
rode
over
from
kentville
to
wolfville
and
then
up
the
gaspereau
at
the
mouth
of
which
english
ships
at
their
swung
with
the
tide
on
the
morning
which
ushered
in
the
doom
of
grand
pré
we
rode
some
distance
up
the
valley
to
the
house
of
a
catholic
farmer
and
there
put
up
for
the
day
it
was
the
day
on
which
the
elections
took
place
for
the
house
of
assembly
the
contest
was
fiercely
conducted
amid
great
popular
excitement
one
of
those
cries
fomented
by
an
artful
politician
which
sometimes
sweep
the
colonies
as
well
as
the
mother
country
was
raging
in
the
province
father
k
left
kentville
the
county
town
on
that
day
to
avoid
all
appearance
of
interference
in
the
election
and
also
to
get
away
from
the
noise
and
confusion
that
pervaded
the
long
main
street
of
the
village
i
can
remember
the
news
coming
up
the
gaspereau
in
the
evening
how
every
one
of
the
four
candidates
opposed
to
father
k
had
been
returned
but
at
that
time
i
paid
little
heed
to
politics
and
during
the
day
i
wandered
down
through
the
field
to
the
river
and
strolled
along
its
banks
some
of
those
willows
were
very
aged
and
might
have
swung
their
long
slim
wands
and
leaves
over
an
evangeline
and
a
gabriel
a
hundred
years
before
those
willows
were
not
the
natural
growth
of
the
forest
but
were
planted
there
by
whom
no
remnant
of
the
people
that
first
tilled
the
valley
was
left
to
say
riding
home
next
day
a
laughable
incident
but
doubtless
somewhat
annoying
to
father
k
occurred
just
as
we
were
about
to
turn
a
narrow
bend
of
the
road
suddenly
we
were
confronted
by
a
long
procession
in
carriages
and
all
sorts
of
country
vehicles
with
banners
flying
men
shouting
and
everything
to
indicate
a
triumphal
parade
it
was
in
fact
a
procession
escorting
two
of
the
members
elected
the
day
before
the
position
was
truly
rueful
but
father
k
had
to
grin
and
bear
it
there
was
no
escape
for
us
we
had
to
draw
up
at
the
side
of
the
road
and
sit
quietly
in
our
single
wagon
until
the
procession
passed
us
it
was
a
very
orderly
and
crowd
but
there
were
a
good
many
broad
grins
as
they
rode
by
at
having
caught
the
portly
and
generally
popular
priest
in
such
a
trap
nothing
would
persuade
them
of
course
but
that
he
had
been
working
might
and
main
for
the
other
side
during
the
election
finally
as
the
tail
of
the
procession
passed
us
some
one
in
the
rear
more
in
humor
than
in
malice
sang
out
h
ll
with
the
there
was
a
roar
of
laughter
at
this
during
which
father
k
gathered
up
his
reins
and
saying
something
under
his
breath
which
i
will
not
vouch
for
as
strictly
a
blessing
applied
the
whip
to
old
dobbin
with
an
energy
that
that
respectable
quadruped
must
have
thought
demanded
explanation
changed
indeed
was
such
a
scene
from
those
daily
witnessed
when
father
felician
and
pedagogue
both
in
the
village
ruled
over
his
peaceful
congregation
at
the
mouth
of
the
gaspereau
it
has
been
said
in
the
beginning
of
this
article
that
evangeline
the
heroine
and
central
figure
of
the
poem
is
not
altogether
true
to
history
as
typical
of
the
acadian
girl
of
that
period
as
seen
in
the
annals
of
port
royal
and
doubtless
this
assertion
can
be
borne
out
by
the
records
but
on
second
thoughts
it
does
appear
as
it
were
a
profanation
to
subject
such
a
bright
creation
of
the
mind
to
the
analysis
of
history
as
profitably
might
we
set
about
converting
the
diamond
into
its
original
carbon
the
magical
chemistry
of
genius
as
of
nature
has
in
either
case
fused
the
dull
and
common
atoms
into
the
sparkling
and
priceless
jewel
the
stoutest
champion
of
her
sex
will
not
upon
consideration
contend
that
so
absolutely
perfect
a
creature
as
evangeline
is
likely
to
be
found
in
any
possible
phase
of
society
is
not
a
spice
of
coquetry
inseparable
from
all
women
evangeline
has
none
of
it
she
is
too
too
unconscious
that
her
lover
for
the
gleam
of
her
lamp
and
her
under
the
trees
in
the
orchard
she
is
the
heroine
of
an
idyl
not
indeed
of
unreal
arthurian
romance
but
of
that
exalted
and
passionless
love
which
the
virgin
heart
seeks
but
afterwards
consoles
itself
for
not
finding
that
ideal
star
does
not
shine
upon
this
world
but
its
divine
rays
fall
softly
upon
many
an
unknown
heart
in
the
cloister
but
it
is
incontestable
that
the
acadian
maidens
of
port
royal
and
mines
shared
in
some
of
the
agreeable
frivolities
which
still
it
is
said
sometimes
distinguish
their
sisters
in
the
world
they
had
an
eye
for
a
military
uniform
and
clanking
spurs
even
in
those
days
it
is
a
frequent
complaint
of
the
french
governors
to
the
home
authorities
at
paris
that
their
young
officers
were
being
continually
led
into
marriage
with
girls
of
the
country
birth
and
worse
still
often
in
the
old
parish
register
of
annapolis
can
be
seen
more
than
one
entry
of
the
union
of
a
gallant
ensign
or
captain
to
a
village
belle
from
the
inland
settlements
whose
visit
to
the
acadian
metropolis
had
subjugated
the
gallic
son
of
mars
nor
was
the
goddess
of
fashion
altogether
without
a
shrine
in
close
contiguity
to
the
pines
and
the
some
of
the
naval
and
military
officers
sent
for
their
wives
from
paris
or
quebec
and
these
fine
ladies
brought
their
maids
with
them
this
is
not
a
supposition
but
a
fact
which
can
be
verified
by
reference
to
the
letters
of
des
goutins
and
others
in
the
correspondence
of
the
time
imagine
a
parisian
soubrette
of
the
xviiith
century
in
the
village
of
grand
pré
it
is
a
shock
to
those
who
derive
their
knowledge
of
acadie
from
poem
but
those
who
are
familiar
with
the
voluminous
records
of
the
day
preserved
in
the
provincial
archives
are
aware
of
a
good
many
stranger
things
than
that
related
in
them
since
was
published
the
canadian
and
nova
scotian
governments
have
done
much
to
collect
and
edit
their
records
and
they
are
now
accessible
to
the
student
rightly
understood
there
is
no
reason
why
the
flood
of
light
thus
thrown
upon
the
lives
of
the
acadians
should
detract
anything
from
our
admiration
for
that
simple
and
kindly
race
they
were
not
faultless
but
the
very
fact
that
they
shared
in
the
common
interests
and
even
foibles
of
the
rest
of
the
world
gives
that
tone
of
reality
to
their
history
which
makes
us
sympathize
with
them
more
justly
in
the
cruel
fate
that
overtook
them
yet
in
depicting
the
young
acadian
girl
of
that
period
as
he
has
done
the
poet
has
but
idealized
the
truth
the
march
of
the
history
of
her
people
aids
him
in
making
the
portrait
a
faithful
one
had
he
placed
the
time
a
little
earlier
that
is
to
say
under
the
and
his
heroine
at
annapolis
his
poem
could
not
have
borne
the
criticism
of
later
research
but
in
selecting
the
most
dramatic
incident
of
acadian
history
as
the
central
point
of
interest
he
has
necessarily
shifted
the
scene
to
one
of
the
neutral
french
settlements
here
too
he
is
aided
in
maintaining
the
truthfulness
of
his
portraiture
by
the
fact
that
the
english
conquest
in
depriving
the
acadians
of
the
right
of
political
action
and
cutting
them
off
as
much
as
possible
from
intercourse
with
canada
and
france
had
thrown
them
back
upon
rural
occupations
alone
and
developed
their
simple
virtues
mines
and
chignecto
had
been
noted
for
their
rustic
independence
and
their
manners
uncorrupted
by
contact
with
the
world
even
under
the
old
one
of
the
military
governors
of
port
royal
complains
of
them
as
in
a
letter
to
the
minister
of
marine
and
colonies
at
paris
after
the
conquest
of
intercourse
with
annapolis
and
its
english
government
house
and
foreign
garrison
became
even
more
restricted
no
oath
of
allegiance
being
taken
to
the
new
government
the
was
recognized
both
by
the
inhabitants
and
the
annapolis
government
as
their
virtual
ruler
under
the
mild
sway
of
fathers
felix
godalie
and
miniac
in
turn
of
mines
the
acadians
sought
to
forget
in
the
cultivation
of
their
fields
the
stern
military
surveillance
of
annapolis
and
later
fort
edwards
and
fort
lawrence
father
miniac
comes
latest
in
time
and
shared
the
misfortunes
of
his
flock
in
their
expulsion
but
in
father
godalie
the
accomplished
scholar
and
friend
of
the
people
of
grand
pré
we
seem
best
to
recognize
the
of
poem
he
was
a
guide
well
fitted
to
form
the
lovely
character
of
evangeline
nor
do
the
authentic
records
of
the
time
bear
less
ample
testimony
to
the
virtue
of
his
people
than
the
glowing
imagination
of
the
poet
it
is
less
in
the
delineation
of
individual
character
than
in
its
description
of
the
undisturbed
peace
reigning
at
grand
pré
that
the
poem
departs
most
from
the
truth
of
history
the
expulsion
of
was
not
a
thunderbolt
in
a
clear
sky
descending
upon
a
garden
of
eden
it
was
a
doom
known
to
be
hanging
over
them
for
forty
years
its
shadow
more
or
less
threatening
for
two
generations
was
present
in
every
acadian
household
disabling
industry
and
driving
the
young
men
into
service
or
correspondence
with
their
french
compatriots
space
would
not
permit
in
so
short
a
paper
to
enter
into
the
history
of
that
desperate
struggle
for
supremacy
on
this
continent
ending
on
the
heights
of
abraham
isolated
chapters
of
which
have
been
narrated
with
a
graphic
pen
by
francis
parkman
acadie
was
one
of
its
chosen
battlegrounds
so
far
from
the
acadians
living
in
rural
peace
and
content
it
may
be
said
broadly
yet
accurately
that
from
the
date
of
their
first
settlement
to
their
final
expulsion
from
the
country
during
a
period
extending
over
one
hundred
and
fifty
years
five
years
had
never
passed
consecutively
without
hostilities
open
or
threatened
the
province
changed
masters
or
was
wholly
or
partially
conquered
seven
times
in
a
little
over
one
hundred
years
and
the
final
english
conquest
so
far
from
establishing
peace
left
the
acadians
in
a
worse
position
than
before
they
refused
to
take
the
oath
of
allegiance
to
the
english
government
the
french
government
was
not
able
to
protect
them
though
it
used
them
to
harass
the
english
they
acquired
therefore
by
a
sort
of
tacit
understanding
the
title
and
position
of
the
french
the
english
government
simply
waiting
from
year
to
year
until
it
felt
itself
strong
enough
to
remove
them
from
the
province
and
the
acadians
yearly
expecting
succor
from
quebec
or
louisburg
each
party
regarded
the
other
as
aliens
and
enemies
hence
it
is
that
no
would
ever
have
used
the
words
applied
to
george
as
spoken
by
basil
the
blacksmith
in
the
poem
that
single
expression
conveys
a
radically
false
impression
of
the
feelings
of
the
people
at
the
time
the
church
at
mines
or
grand
pré
from
the
belfry
of
which
the
angelus
sounded
had
been
burned
down
twice
by
the
english
and
its
altar
vessels
stolen
by
church
in
the
old
wars
nor
had
permanent
conquest
as
we
have
said
brought
any
change
for
the
better
the
were
frequently
imprisoned
on
pretext
of
exciting
attacks
on
the
english
garrisons
and
sometimes
as
in
the
case
of
father
felix
and
father
charlemagne
were
exiled
from
the
province
in
the
intention
was
first
announced
of
transporting
all
the
acadians
from
their
homes
it
was
proposed
to
remove
them
to
cape
breton
still
held
by
the
french
the
pathetic
remonstrance
of
father
felix
palm
the
of
grand
pré
in
a
letter
and
petition
to
the
governor
averted
this
great
calamity
from
his
people
at
that
time
but
the
project
was
again
revived
by
the
english
board
of
trade
in
pursuance
of
its
orders
gov
philipps
issued
a
proclamation
commanding
the
people
of
mines
to
come
in
and
take
the
oath
of
allegiance
by
a
certain
day
or
to
depart
forthwith
out
of
the
province
permitting
at
the
same
time
a
stretch
of
generosity
which
will
hardly
be
appreciated
at
this
day
each
family
to
carry
away
with
it
sheep
but
all
the
rest
of
their
property
to
be
confiscated
this
storm
also
blew
over
but
the
result
of
this
continual
harassment
and
threatening
was
to
drive
the
acadians
into
closer
correspondence
with
the
french
at
louisburg
and
to
cause
their
young
men
to
enlist
in
the
forces
on
the
frontier
in
view
of
this
aid
and
comfort
given
to
the
enemy
and
their
persistent
refusal
to
take
the
oath
of
allegiance
later
english
writers
have
not
hesitated
to
declare
the
removal
of
the
acadians
from
the
province
a
political
and
military
necessity
but
the
otherwise
unanimous
voice
of
humanity
has
unequivocally
denounced
their
wholesale
deportation
as
one
of
the
most
cruel
and
tyrannical
acts
in
the
colonial
history
of
england
we
are
not
to
suppose
however
that
the
acadians
folded
their
hands
while
utter
ruin
was
thus
threatening
them
in
they
joined
in
the
attack
on
force
at
mines
in
which
one
hundred
of
the
english
were
killed
and
wounded
and
the
rest
of
his
command
made
prisoners
they
were
accused
not
without
some
show
of
reason
of
supporting
the
indians
in
their
attack
on
the
new
settlement
at
halifax
it
is
admitted
that
three
hundred
of
them
including
many
of
the
young
men
from
grand
pré
were
among
the
prisoners
taken
at
fort
beau
sejour
on
the
border
a
few
months
before
their
expulsion
it
is
not
our
purpose
to
enter
into
any
defence
or
condemnation
of
those
hostilities
but
it
is
plain
that
beautiful
lines
describing
the
columns
of
pale
blue
smoke
like
clouds
of
incense
ascending
a
hundred
hearths
the
homes
of
peace
and
contentment
from
fear
that
reigns
with
the
tyrant
or
envy
the
vice
of
republics
were
not
applicable
to
the
condition
of
affairs
at
grand
pré
in
nor
at
any
time
the
poem
follows
with
fidelity
the
outlines
of
the
scenes
of
the
expulsion
indeed
is
the
scene
as
described
even
by
those
who
were
agents
in
its
execution
the
poet
gives
almost
the
address
of
john
winslow
in
the
chapel
nevertheless
one
important
clause
is
omitted
barbarous
as
were
the
orders
of
gov
lawrence
he
was
not
absolutely
devoid
of
humanity
some
attempt
was
made
to
lessen
the
pangs
of
separation
from
their
country
by
the
issuing
of
orders
to
the
military
commanders
that
families
should
go
together
on
the
same
these
orders
were
communicated
with
the
others
to
the
inhabitants
by
winslow
and
it
appears
they
were
faithfully
executed
as
far
as
the
haste
of
embarkation
would
permit
but
as
the
young
men
marched
separately
to
the
ships
and
some
of
them
escaped
for
a
time
into
the
woods
there
was
nothing
to
prevent
such
an
incident
occurring
as
the
separation
of
evangeline
and
gabriel
about
seven
thousand
acadians
according
to
gov
letter
to
winslow
were
transported
from
their
homes
the
total
number
of
these
unfortunate
people
in
the
province
at
that
time
has
been
estimated
at
eighteen
thousand
the
destruction
was
more
complete
at
grand
pré
than
elsewhere
that
being
the
oldest
settlement
with
the
exception
of
annapolis
and
the
most
prosperous
and
thickly
settled
a
few
years
later
another
attempt
was
made
to
transfer
the
remainder
of
the
acadian
population
to
new
england
but
the
transports
were
not
permitted
to
land
them
at
boston
as
they
were
completely
destitute
and
the
new
england
commonwealths
petitioned
against
being
made
responsible
for
their
support
the
acadian
exiles
were
scattered
over
pennsylvania
virginia
and
georgia
about
four
hundred
and
fifty
were
landed
at
philadelphia
that
delightful
land
which
is
washed
by
the
waters
guarding
in
sylvan
shades
the
name
of
penn
the
apostle
stands
on
the
banks
of
its
beautiful
stream
the
city
he
founded
there
from
the
troubled
sea
had
evangeline
landed
an
exile
finding
among
the
children
of
penn
a
home
and
a
a
few
months
ago
i
visited
the
quaker
city
there
where
evangeline
ended
her
long
pilgrimage
i
took
up
the
thread
of
that
story
the
early
scenes
of
which
had
been
so
familiar
to
me
how
different
those
around
me
gone
were
the
balsamic
odors
of
the
pines
and
the
salt
spray
of
the
ocean
one
can
conceive
how
the
hearts
of
the
poor
acadian
exiles
must
have
trembled
i
sought
out
the
old
church
at
wicaco
whence
the
of
psalms
the
meadows
were
on
the
sabbath
morning
when
evangeline
went
on
her
way
to
the
hospital
and
there
found
her
lover
dying
unknown
the
quaint
little
church
not
larger
than
a
country
built
of
red
and
black
bricks
brought
from
sweden
is
now
almost
lost
in
a
corner
near
the
edge
in
the
midst
of
huge
warehouses
and
intersecting
railroad
tracks
in
the
wall
near
the
desk
is
a
tablet
in
memory
of
the
first
pastor
and
his
wife
buried
beneath
fastened
to
the
gallery
of
the
choir
not
much
higher
than
head
is
the
old
swedish
bible
first
used
in
the
church
and
over
it
two
gilded
wooden
cherubs
also
brought
from
sweden
that
make
one
smile
at
their
comical
features
in
the
churchyard
under
the
blue
and
faded
gray
tombstones
repose
the
men
and
women
of
the
congregation
of
and
years
before
but
no
vestiges
of
the
acadian
wanderers
remain
in
the
catholic
by
side
in
their
nameless
graves
the
lovers
are
sleeping
under
the
humble
walls
of
the
little
catholic
churchyard
in
the
heart
of
the
city
they
lie
unknown
and
many
of
the
acadians
succeeded
in
wandering
back
to
their
country
others
escaped
into
what
is
now
called
new
brunswick
which
was
then
a
part
of
acadia
and
either
returned
to
nova
scotia
in
when
the
whole

more
historical
from
the
french
of
the
princesse
de
craon
iv
william
du
bellay
having
remained
in
france
de
vaux
had
been
sent
to
replace
him
in
england
the
latter
having
but
recently
returned
from
rome
where
he
was
attached
to
the
embassy
of
de
grammont
french
ambassador
to
that
court
was
not
yet
initiated
into
the
state
of
affairs
as
they
existed
at
the
court
of
henry
viii
du
bellay
was
not
satisfied
with
the
change
and
the
old
diplomate
finding
his
new
assistant
inclined
to
be
somewhat
dull
undertook
to
enlighten
him
leading
him
on
step
by
step
into
the
intricacies
of
diplomacy
like
a
mother
or
rather
a
governess
a
little
brusque
who
is
impatient
at
the
slow
progress
the
child
makes
in
learning
to
walk
he
exclaimed
see
you
understand
nothing
of
this
so
i
shall
have
to
be
patient
and
begin
it
all
over
again
it
is
incredible
he
added
by
way
of
digression
addressing
himself
to
the
public
who
was
absent
absurd
reports
are
circulated
outside
with
regard
to
what
we
say
and
do
in
our
secret
negotiations
it
extends
even
to
all
these
harebrains
of
the
court
but
you
who
have
a
foot
in
diplomacy
i
can
not
excuse
come
let
us
see
we
say
my
brother
left
he
went
to
demand
on
the
part
of
henry
of
the
universities
of
france
and
above
all
that
of
paris
preponderating
over
all
the
others
remark
well
to
demand
i
say
that
they
should
give
decisions
favorable
to
the
divorce
now
this
point
appeared
at
first
quite
insignificant
but
it
is
just
here
we
have
shown
our
ability
i
would
say
i
but
i
do
not
wish
to
vaunt
over
a
young
man
just
starting
out
in
the
world
like
yourself
then
our
king
has
replied
to
the
king
of
england
that
he
would
ask
nothing
better
than
to
use
his
influence
with
the
universities
to
induce
them
to
give
satisfaction
on
this
subject
but
that
notice
this
especially
the
emperor
charles
had
made
precisely
the
same
demand
in
an
opposite
direction
in
favor
of
queen
catherine
his
aunt
that
if
he
refused
the
emperor
he
would
be
extremely
displeased
and
that
he
was
compelled
to
reflect
a
second
time
because
the
princes
his
children
were
held
as
hostages
in
the
hands
of
the
emperor
and
in
spite
of
all
his
efforts
he
had
not
yet
been
able
to
pay
the
price
of
their
ransom
stipulated
at
the
treaty
of
cambrai
then
remained
to
say
that
we
could
do
nothing
for
him
on
the
contrary
must
oppose
him
so
long
as
the
children
were
held
prisoners
or
while
there
was
even
a
chance
that
they
would
be
restored
to
us
on
condition
that
we
should
throw
our
influence
on
the
side
of
queen
catherine
all
of
which
is
as
clear
as
day
is
it
not
now
you
are
going
to
see
if
i
have
understood
how
to
take
advantage
of
these
considerations
with
henry
saying
this
with
a
slightly
derisive
smile
du
bellay
took
from
a
drawer
a
casket
of
green
sharkskin
which
he
handed
to
de
vaux
who
opened
it
eagerly
how
beautiful
he
exclaimed
taking
from
the
case
and
holding
up
in
the
sunlight
a
magnificent
de
composed
entirely
of
diamonds
this
is
most
it
is
beautiful
replied
du
bellay
with
a
satisfied
air
worth
one
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
crowns
philip
the
father
pledged
it
to
the
king
of
england
for
that
sum
we
are
obliged
by
the
treaty
to
redeem
it
but
as
we
have
not
the
money
to
pay
it
has
been
made
a
present
to
us
and
here
is
what
is
better
still
he
added
displaying
a
quittance
receipt
in
full
for
five
hundred
thousand
crowns
which
the
emperor
owed
henry
viii
and
he
now
makes
a
present
of
it
to
francis
to
enable
him
to
pay
immediately
the
two
millions
required
for
the
ransom
of
the
is
admirable
cried
de
vaux
must
be
admitted
my
lord
that
we
shall
be
under
great
obligations
to
mlle
disorders
cost
dear
my
child
replied
du
bellay
if
this
continues
they
will
ruin
england
think
of
what
will
have
to
be
paid
yet
to
the
university
of
paris
do
you
suppose
they
will
consent
to
this
demand
interrupted
de
vaux
truly
i
do
not
believe
it
replied
du
bellay
master
gervais
who
is
always
found
ready
to
do
anything
asked
of
him
i
know
not
how
they
will
decide
but
between
ourselves
i
tell
you
i
believe
they
will
be
against
it
but
observe
we
have
not
promised
a
favorable
decision
we
have
only
left
it
to
be
hoped
for
which
is
quite
a
different
is
very
adroit
replied
de
vaux
but
it
seems
to
me
not
very
not
honest
murmured
du
bellay
contracting
his
little
gray
eyebrows
and
fixing
his
greenish
eyes
on
the
fair
face
of
the
youth
honest
he
again
exclaimed
in
a
stentorian
voice
do
you
come
from
then
young
man
know
that
among
these
people
honesty
is
a
thing
unheard
of
others
less
candid
than
myself
may
tell
you
the
contrary
knowing
very
well
that
such
is
not
the
truth
they
arrange
projects
with
the
intention
of
defeating
them
they
sign
treaties
with
the
studied
purpose
of
violating
them
they
swear
to
keep
the
peace
in
order
to
prepare
for
war
and
a
state
sells
her
authority
and
puts
her
influence
in
the
balance
of
the
world
in
favor
of
the
highest
bidder
let
the
price
be
earth
or
metal
it
is
of
no
consequence
i
make
no
distinction
when
henry
devastated
our
territories
and
took
possession
of
our
provinces
was
it
just
no
makes
that
is
the
veritable
law
of
nations
the
only
one
they
are
willing
to
acknowledge
or
adopt
in
default
of
strength
there
remains
stratagem
and
i
must
use
it
existing
circumstances
you
are
right
replied
de
vaux
replacing
in
its
case
the
superb
de
and
again
waving
it
in
the
sunlight
is
a
pity
he
added
they
may
be
obliged
to
return
this
it
would
set
off
wonderfully
well
the
wedding
dress
of
the
future
duchess
of
are
they
speaking
already
of
the
marriage
of
the
young
duke
of
orleans
asked
du
bellay
in
surprise
that
is
a
great
secret
replied
de
vaux
confidentially
know
our
king
has
not
abandoned
the
idea
of
subjugating
the
milanese
and
to
ensure
the
friendship
he
offers
to
marry
his
second
son
to
his
niece
the
young
catherine
cried
du
bellay
it
is
impossible
how
can
they
forget
that
but
a
short
time
since
the
medici
family
was
composed
of
only
the
simple
merchants
of
florence
has
all
been
arranged
notwithstanding
replied
de
vaux
spite
of
all
our
precautions
the
emperor
has
been
apprised
of
it
at
first
he
refused
to
credit
it
and
would
not
believe
the
king
of
france
could
really
think
of
allying
his
noble
blood
with
that
of
the
medici
in
the
meantime
he
has
been
so
much
frightened
lest
the
hope
of
this
alliance
would
not
sufficiently
dazzle
clement
that
he
has
made
a
proposal
to
break
off
the
marriage
of
his
niece
the
princess
of
denmark
with
the
duke
of
milan
and
substitute
the
young
catherine
in
her
place
we
have
as
you
may
well
suppose
promptly
advised
de
montmorency
of
all
these
things
who
returned
us
on
the
spot
full
power
to
sign
the
articles
de
grammont
immediately
carried
them
to
the
pope
and
he
was
greatly
delighted
as
austria
it
seems
had
already
got
ahead
of
us
and
persuaded
him
that
we
had
no
other
intention
than
to
deceive
him
and
gain
time
now
everything
is
harmoniously
arranged
they
promise
for
the
marriage
portion
of
catherine
reggio
pisa
leghorn
modena

the
duchy
of
urbino
and
francis
cedes
to
his
son
his
claims
to
the
duchy
of
compensation
for
a
bad
marriage
replied
du
bellay
angrily
complications
which
will
only
result
in
bringing
about
interminable
disputes
princes
can
never
learn
to
be
contented
with
the
territory
already
belonging
to
them
although
they
may
not
possess
sufficient
ability
to
govern
even
well
still
they
are
always
trying
to
extend
it
war
must
waste
and
ruin
a
happy
and
flourishing
country
in
order
to
put
them
in
possession
of
a
few
feet
of
desolated
earth
all
sprinkled
with
gold
and
watered
with
yes
interrupted
de
vaux
earnestly
have
learned
this
cruelly
and
to
our
cost
and
relentless
history
will
record
without
regret
the
account
of
our
reverses
and
the
captivity
of
a
king
so
valiant
and
dauntless
a
king
who
has
sacrificed
everything
save
his
my
dear
on
all
this
the
honor
of
a
king
consists
not
in
sacrificing
the
happiness
of
his
people
a
soldier
should
be
brave
the
head
of
a
nation
should
be
wise
and
prudent
replied
du
bellay
as
he
turned
over
a
great
file
of
papers
in
search
of
something
without
prudence
is
worthless
the
intrigues
of
the
cabinet
are
more
certain
they
are
of
more
value
than
the
best
generals
they
at
least
are
never
entirely
defeated
the
disaster
of
the
evening
inspires
renewed
strength
for
the
morrow
cold
hunger
and
sickness
are
not
able
to
destroy
they
can
only
waste
a
few
words
or
lose
a
sum
of
money
a
dozen
spies
spread
their
toils
in
every
direction
we
hold
them
like
bundles
of
straw
in
our
hands
they
glide
in
the
dark
slip
through
your
fingers
an
army
that
can
not
be
captured
which
exists
not
and
yet
never
dies
which
drags
to
the
tribunal
of
those
who
pay
them
without
pity
as
without
discrimination
without
violence
as
without
hesitation
the
hearts
of
all
mankind
my
child

never

with

we
can
move
the
world
with
blood
we
destroy
it
your
heart
young
man
leaps
within
you
at
the
sound
of
the
shrill
trumpet
when
glittering
banners
wave
and
the
noise
of
battle
inebriates
your
soul
but
look
behind
you
child
look
behind
you
the
squadron
has
passed
hear
the
shrieks
and
groans
of
the
dying
behold
those
men
dragging
themselves
over
the
trampled
field
their
heads
gashed
and
bleeding
their
bones
dislocated
their
limbs
torn
streams
of
blood
flow
from
their
wounds
they
die
in
an
ocean
furnished
from
their
own
lacerated
veins
go
there
to
the
field
of
carnage
and
death
pause
beside
that
man
with
pallid
face
and
agonized
expression
think
of
the
tender
care
and
painful
anxiety
of
the
mother
who
reared
him
from
his
cradle
how
often
she
has
pressed
her
lips
upon
the
golden
curls
of
her
boy
the
hope
of
her
old
age
which
must
now
end
in
despair
reflect
there
upon
the
field
of
carnage
and
death
on
the
tender
caresses
of
wives
sisters
and
friends
imagine
the
grief
the
deep
anguish
of
the
father
alas
all
these
recollections
pass
in
an
instant
before
the
eyes
of
the
dying
farewell
dream
of
glory
hateful
vision
now
for
ever
vanished
life
is
almost
extinct
yet
with
the
latest
breath
he
thinks
but
of
them
will
see
me
no
more
i
must
die
far
away
without
being
able
to
bid
them
a
last
such
are
the
bitter
thoughts
murmured
by
his
dying
lips
as
the
last
sigh
is
breathed
forth
tell
me
young
man
have
you
never
reflected
when
on
the
field
glittering
in
the
bright
summer
sunshine
you
have
seen
the
heavy
battalions
advance
when
the
prince
rode
in
the
midst
of
them
and
they
saluted
him
with
shouts
of
enthusiasm
and
love
when
that
prince
a
weak
man
like
themselves
elated
with
pride
said
to
them
on
to
death
it
is
for
me
that
you
go
for
you
and
who
are
you
their
executioner
who
throws
their
ashes
to
the
wind
of
your
ambition
to
satisfy
the
thirst
of
your
covetousness
the
insolent
pride
of
your
name
which
the
century
will
see
buried
in
oblivion
ah
my
son
continued
the
old
diplomate
deeply
affected
with
his
hands
crossed
on
the
packet
of
papers
that
he
had
entirely
forgotten
you
knew
how
much
i
have
seen
in
my
life
of
these
horrible
calamities
of
these
monstrous
follies
which
devastate
the
world
if
you
but
knew
how
my
heart
has
groaned
within
me
concealed
beneath
my
gloomy
visage
my
exterior
as
impassible
as
my
garments
you
would
understand
how
i
hate
them
these
mighty
conquerors
these
vile
plagues
of
the
earth
and
how
i
count
as
nothing
the
sack
of
gold
which
lies
at
the
bottom
of
the
precipice
over
which
they
push
us
the
adroit
fraud
that
turns
them
aside
from
their
course
but
shall
i
weep
like
an
old
woman
he
suddenly
exclaimed
vexed
at
being
betrayed
into
the
expression
of
so
much
emotion
hastily
brushing
the
tear
from
his
cheek
he
began
examining
the
package
of
papers
and
instantly
recovering
his
usual
composure
became
du
bellay
the
diplomate
young
de
vaux
greatly
surprised
at
the
excess
of
feeling
into
which
the
ambassador
had
suddenly
been
betrayed
so
much
at
variance
with
his
previous
manner
as
well
as
his
rule
of
conduct
and
the
rather
brusque
reception
he
had
given
him
still
remembered
it
when
all
thought
of
the
occurrence
had
passed
from
the
mind
of
his
superior
sir
read
that
he
exclaimed
throwing
the
young
man
a
small
scrap
of
paper
will
read
it
my
aloud
wolsey
overcome
by
grief
and
alarm
has
fallen
dangerously
ill
the
king
has
been
informed
of
it
he
has
ordered
three
physicians
to
asher
and
obliged
lady
anne
to
send
him
the
golden
tablets
in
token
of
his
reconciliation
furthermore
it
is
certainly
true
that
the
king
has
said
would
not
lose
wolsey
for
twenty
thousand
it
is
unnecessary
to
impress
upon
my
lord
the
importance
of
this
event
my
lord
will
i
hope
approve
of
the
celerity
with
which
i
have
despatched
this
is
without
signature
said
de
vaux
credit
it
entirely
murmured
du
bellay
my
faith
i
am
delighted
these
golden
tablets
afford
me
extreme
pleasure
said
de
vaux
will
revive
the
hopes
of
poor
cardinal
that
is
all
and
you
content
to
know
that
he
is
happy
will
remain
quietly
seated
in
your
chair
i
suppose
said
du
bellay
fixing
his
green
eyes
lighted
with
a
brilliant
gleam
on
young
de
vaux
he
continued
is
not
in
this
way
a
man
attends
to
the
business
of
his
country
since
the
day
the
cardinal
was
exiled
i
have
deliberated
whether
i
should
go
to
see
him
or
not
my
heart
prompted
me
to
do
so
but
it
was
not
my
heart
i
had
to
consult
i
was
persuaded
the
king
would
not
be
able
to
dispense
with
him
and
sooner
or
later
he
would
be
recalled
to
the
head
of
affairs
in
that
case
i
felt
inclined
to
give
him
a
proof
of
my
attachment
in
his
disgrace
but
on
the
other
hand
that
intriguing
family
who
are
constantly
buzzing
around
the
king
induced
me
constantly
to
hesitate
now
i
believe
we
have
almost
nothing
more
to
fear
we
will
arrive
there
perhaps
before
the
physicians
and
later
we
shall
know
how
to
willingly
cried
de
vaux
shall
be
happy
indeed
to
see
this
celebrated
man
of
whom
i
have
heard
so
many
different
interrupted
du
bellay
impatiently
by
what
is
styled
a
tribunal
composed
of
the
ignorant
the
deluded
and
who
always
clamor
louder
than
others
and
who
take
great
care
in
order
to
avoid
compromising
their
stupidity
to
prefix
the
ominous
to
all
their
statements
as
for
me
i
say
they
invariably
display
more
hatred
toward
the
virtues
they
envy
than
the
vices
they
pretend
to
despise
and
they
will
judge
a
man
more
severely
and
criticise
him
more
harshly
for
the
good
he
has
tried
to
do
than
for
what
he
may
have
left
gossiping
prying
crowd
pronouncing
judgment
and
knowing
nothing
who
will
cast
popularity
like
a
vile
mantle
over
the
shoulders
of
any
man
who
will
basely
stoop
low
enough
before
them
to
receive
it
he
who
endeavors
to
please
all
pleases
none
added
du
bellay
with
a
singularly
scornful
expression
live
for
his
king
and
above
all
for
his
country
despising
the
blame
or
hatred
of
the
vulgar
should
be
the
motto
of
every
public
man
and
god
grant
i
may
never
cease
to
remember
it
believe
then
the
cardinal
will
be
restored
to
the
head
of
affairs
asked
de
vaux
running
his
fingers
through
his
blonde
curls
and
rising
to
depart
am
not
sure
of
it
yet
replied
du
bellay
are
going
to
find
out
if
the
crowd
surrounds
him
as
eager
to
pay
him
homage
as
they
were
yesterday
to
overwhelm
him
with
scorn
and
contempt
if
in
a
word
the
courtiers
sigh
and
groan
around
his
bed
and
pretend
to
feel
the
deepest
concern
it
will
be
a
most
certain
indication
of
his
return
to
favor
and
to
speak
frankly
i
believe
the
king
already
begins
to
discover
that
no
one
can
replace
the
cardinal
near
his
person
as
private
secretary
for
that
poor
gardiner
copies
a
despatch
with
more
difficulty
than
his
predecessor
dictated
du
bellay
arose
and
started
followed
by
de
vaux
to
the
bank
of
the
thames
where
they
entered
a
large
boat
already
filled
with
passengers
awaiting
the
moment
of
departure
to
ascend
the
river
either
to
chelsea
battersea
or
as
far
as
pultney
where
the
boat
stopped
bales
of
merchandise
were
piled
up
in
the
centre
on
which
were
seated
a
number
of
substantial
citizens
conversing
together
with
their
hands
in
their
pockets
and
wearing
the
air
of
men
the
extent
of
whose
purse
and
credit
were
well
understood
they
fixed
at
first
a
scrutinizing
glance
on
the
new
arrivals
and
then
resumed
their
conversation
come
let
us
be
off
now
exclaimed
a
young
man
balancing
himself
on
one
foot
is
half
an
hour
lost
and
i
declare
i
must
be
at
chelsea
to
it
is
already
an
hour
look
here
this
cockswain
resemble
our
parliament
at
all
does
everything
it
is
told
to
do
he
added
as
he
sauntered
into
the
midst
of
the
crowd
your
tongue
william
immediately
replied
one
of
them
recollect
any
more
i
suppose
the
assembly
at
bridewell
where
the
king
knowing
we
condemned
his
course
in
the
divorce
affair
after
having
seized
all
the
arms
in
the
city
told
us
himself
there
was
no
head
so
high
but
he
would
make
it
fall
if
it
attempted
to
resist
shameful
tyranny
replied
another
rolling
a
bundle
under
his
foot
can
not
think
of
it
without
my
blood
boiling
are
these
englishmen
he
treats
in
this
manner
that
wicked
cardinal
continued
his
neighbor
in
a
loud
shrill
voice
was
standing
by
the
king
and
looking
at
us
with
his
threatening
eyes
he
has
been
the
cause
of
all
the
troubles
we
have
had
with
this
affair
but
we
are
rid
of
him
at
are
rid
of
him
did
you
say
interrupted
a
man
about
fifty
or
sixty
years
of
age
who
appeared
to
be
naturally
phlegmatic
and
thoughtful
are
very
well
contented
it
seems
to
me
but
it
is
because
you
only
think
of
the
present
and
give
yourself
no
concern
whatever
about
the
future
ah
well
in
a
few
days
we
will
see
if
you
are
as
well
why
not
then
they
all
exclaimed
in
the
same
voice
i
tell
you
because
yourself
more
clearly
master
wrilliot
continued
young
william
always
know
going
to
happen
better
than
anybody
yes
i
know
it
only
too
well
in
fact
my
young
friend
he
replied
shaking
his
head
ominously
we
will
very
soon
learn
to
our
sorrow
that
if
the
favor
of
the
cardinal
costs
us
dear
his
disgrace
will
cost
us
still
more
parliament
is
going
to
remit
all
the
all
of
his
debts
but
parliament
has
no
right
to
do
this
they
all
exclaimed
but
it
will
take
the
right
replied
master
wrilliot
will
lose
half
of
his
marriage
portion
which
if
i
mistake
not
his
father
gave
him
in
royal
trust
and
i
shall
lose
fifteen
thousand
crowns
for
which
i
was
foolish
enough
to
accept
the
deed
of
ah
that
will
be
too
unjust
it
ought
not
to
be
they
all
repeated
continued
this
interlocutor
shaking
his
head
contemptuously
king
has
no
money
to
pay
us
war
has
drained
his
private
treasury
but
he
nevertheless
draws
from
it
abundant
means
to
ransom
french
princes
who
make
him
believe
they
will
marry
him
to
that
lady
boleyn
and
if
you
do
not
believe
me
go
ask
these
frenchmen
who
are
here
present
he
added
raising
his
voice
and
casting
on
mm
du
bellay
and
de
vaux
a
glance
of
cold
disdainful
wrath
du
bellay
had
lost
nothing
of
the
conversation
it
was
held
too
near
him
and
was
too
openly
hostile
for
him
to
feign
not
to
remark
it
finding
himself
recognized
and
neither
being
able
to
reply
to
a
positive
interrogation
nor
to
keep
silence
he
measured
in
his
turn
very
coolly
and
without
permitting
the
least
indication
of
emotion
or
anger
to
appear
the
face
and
form
of
his
adversary
he
exclaimed
regarding
him
steadily
are
you
and
by
what
right
do
you
call
me
to
account
if
it
is
your
curiosity
that
impels
you
it
will
not
be
gratified
if
on
the
contrary
you
dare
seek
to
insult
me
you
should
know
i
will
not
suffer
it
answer
me
best
you
can
make
of
it
will
be
worth
nothing
replied
with
a
loud
burst
of
laughter
a
genoese
merchant
who
did
not
recognize
the
ambassador
as
he
sat
by
the
men
who
directed
the
boat
your
quarrel
gentlemen
and
instead
of
disputing
come
look
at
this
beautiful
vessel
we
are
just
going
to
pass
see
she
is
getting
ready
to
sail
a
fine
a
set
of
adventurers
who
go
to
try
their
fortunes
in
the
new
world
discovered
by
one
of
my
countrymen
he
added
with
an
air
of
intense
satisfaction
columbus
replied
one
of
the
citizens
experienced
throughout
his
life
that
glory
does
not
give
happiness
and
envy
and
ingratitude
united
together
to
crush
his
genius
do
you
not
believe
if
he
could
have
foreseen
the
cruelties
hernando
cortez
and
pizarro
exercised
toward
the
people
whom
he
discovered
he
would
have
preferred
leaving
the
secret
of
their
existence
buried
for
ever
in
the
bosom
of
the
stormy
sea
that
bore
him
to
europe
rather
than
to
have
announced
there
the
success
of
his
voyage
believe
it
said
wrilliot
soul
was
so
beautiful
he
loved
columbus
exclaimed
young
william
full
of
youthful
enthusiasm
and
admiration
for
a
man
whose
home
was
the
ocean
can
not
hear
his
name
pronounced
without
emotion
i
always
imagine
i
see
him
in
that
old
convent
of
salamanca
before
those
learned
professors
and
erudite
monks
assembled
to
listen
to
a
project
which
in
their
opinion
was
as
rash
as
it
was
foolish
do
you
suppose
said
they
your
vessel
will
ever
reach
the
extremity
of
the
indies
since
you
pretend
that
the
earth
is
round
you
would
never
be
able
to
return
for
what
amount
of
wind
do
you
imagine
it
would
require
to
enable
your
ship
to
remount
the
liquid
mountain
which
it
had
so
easily
descended
and
do
you
forget
that
no
creature
can
live
under
the
scorching
atmosphere
of
the
torrid
zone
refuted
their
arguments
but
these
doctors
still
insisted
nor
hesitated
to
openly
demand
of
him
how
he
could
be
so
presumptuous
as
to
believe
if
the
thing
had
been
as
he
said
it
could
have
remained
undiscovered
by
so
many
illustrious
men
born
before
him
and
who
had
attained
the
highest
degree
of
learning
while
for
him
alone
should
have
been
reserved
the
development
of
this
grand
yet
said
wrilliot
who
had
listened
in
silence
was
permitted
some
years
later
that
he
should
go
down
to
the
grave
wearing
the
chains
with
which
his
persecutors
had
loaded
him
in
order
to
keep
him
away
from
the
world
that
he
alone
had
been
able
to
discover
perseverance
what
obstacles
he
succeeded
in
overcoming
replied
one
of
those
who
had
first
spoken
shall
always
while
i
live
recall
with
pleasure
having
been
of
service
to
his
brother
bartholomew
when
he
came
to
this
he
came
here
repeated
william
and
was
in
my
own
house
continued
the
citizen
finding
the
senate
of
genoa
and
the
king
of
portugal
refused
equally
to
listen
or
furnish
him
with
vessels
necessary
for
the
enterprise
he
had
so
long
meditated
sent
his
brother
to
king
henry
vii
he
was
unfortunately
captured
in
coming
over
by
some
pirates
who
kept
him
in
slavery
many
years
elapsed
before
he
succeeded
in
escaping
and
reaching
england
where
he
found
himself
reduced
to
such
a
state
of
destitution
that
he
was
obliged
to
design
charts
for
a
living
and
to
enable
him
to
present
himself
in
decent
apparel
at
court
the
king
gave
him
a
favorable
reception
but
christopher
in
the
meantime
receiving
no
intelligence
from
his
brother
solicited
so
earnestly
the
court
of
spain
that
he
obtained
two
small
vessels
from
isabella
of
castile
and
very
soon
after
europe
learned
of
the
existence
of
another
hemisphere
spain
planted
her
standard
there
and
we
thus
lost
the
advantages
which
were
destined
for
do
not
regret
it
replied
an
old
man
sitting
in
the
midst
of
the
crowd
who
had
until
that
time
maintained
a
profound
silence
it
not
better
for
a
nation
to
be
less
rich
and
powerful
than
stained
with
so
many
crimes
it
is
now
but
years
since
columbus
founded
the
colony
of
san
domingo
this
island
then
contained
a
million
of
inhabitants
there
scarcely
remain
forty
thousand
but
pursued
the
old
man
with
a
bitter
smile
will
not
stop
there
no
they
will
not
confine
their
barbarous
exploits
to
that
miserable
region
they
are
renewing
in
peru
the
carnage
they
carried
on
in
mexico
it
is
necessary
to
have
a
great
many
places
for
a
man
to
die
to
pass
a
few
moments
and
then
go
and
hide
himself
in
the
grave
i
have
already
lived
years
and
yet
it
seems
to
me
now
that
my
left
hand
still
rests
on
my
cradle
i
can
scarcely
believe
that
these
white
locks
are
scattered
upon
my
head
for
my
life
has
sped
like
the
fleeting
dream
of
a
single
night
that
has
passed
yes
william
continued
the
old
man
look
at
me
with
astonishment
and
your
eyes
full
of
youthful
fire
are
fixed
upon
mine
in
which
the
light
has
long
been
extinguished
ah
well
you
will
very
soon
see
it
extinguished
in
your
own
but
not
before
you
will
have
witnessed
all
their
is
bad
replied
william
these
indians
are
stupid
and
indolent
beyond
all
parallel
they
will
neither
work
nor
pay
the
taxes
imposed
on
from
whom
do
the
spaniards
claim
the
right
of
reducing
these
people
to
a
state
of
servitude
exclaimed
the
old
man
indignantly
to
treat
them
like
beasts
of
burden
whom
they
are
privileged
to
exterminate
with
impunity
and
carry
off
the
gold
their
avarice
covets
the
dagger
in
one
hand
the
scourge
in
the
other
they
ensure
them
they
say
the
happiness
of
knowing
the
christian
religion
how
dare
they
presume
to
instruct
these
people
in
that
gospel
of
peace
which
commands
us
to
love
our
neighbor
as
ourselves
to
detach
our
hearts
from
the
things
of
the
world
and
leaving
our
offering
before
the
altar
go
and
be
reconciled
with
our
enemy
that
point
of
view
your
argument
would
seem
just
replied
william
the
fact
is
if
the
spaniards
did
not
force
these
islanders
to
work
them
the
mines
would
remain
unproductive
the
fields
uncultivated
and
the
colonies
would
are
mistaken
replied
the
old
man
acting
as
she
does
spain
destroys
in
her
own
womb
the
source
from
whence
she
would
draw
an
immense
revenue
if
she
had
been
satisfied
to
establish
an
honest
and
peaceable
commerce
with
these
countries
her
industry
excited
to
the
highest
degree
by
the
rich
commodities
of
exchange
would
have
conferred
an
incalculable
benefit
on
an
entire
people
whom
her
blind
cupidity
has
induced
her
to
crush
and
destroy
you
suppose
these
isolated
negroes
they
buy
at
such
enormous
prices
will
ever
be
able
to
replace
the
native
inhabitants
who
live
and
die
in
their
own
country
this
strange
and
ferocious
population
will
remain
among
the
colonies
enemies
always
ready
to
revolt
a
yoke
of
iron
and
blood
will
alone
be
sufficient
to
keep
them
in
subjection
but
let
these
masters
tremble
if
ever
the
power
falls
into
the
hands
of
their
slaves
mm
du
bellay
and
de
vaux
listened
to
this
conversation
in
silence
and
the
diversion
was
at
first
agreeable
but
they
were
soon
convinced
that
they
were
suddenly
becoming
again
the
objects
of
general
attention
tell
you
exclaimed
one
are
going
to
look
for
the
cardinal
and
bring
him
back
to
replied
another
would
like
to
see
du
bellay
in
the
place
of
the
legate
and
what
have
they
done
with
him
then
they
all
eagerly
demanded
was
arrested
at
dover
where
he
had
gone
to
embark
he
was
dreadfully
alarmed
believing
they
came
to
assassinate
him
his
baggage
was
searched
in
order
to
find
treasures
with
which
he
was
entrusted
they
said
for
safe
did
they
find
them
asked
the
genoese
merchant
eagerly
leaning
forward
at
the
sound
of
the
word
treasure
seems
they
did
not
find
them
was
the
reply
what
they
say
whispered
young
de
vaux
in
the
ear
of
du
bellay
presume
they
were
in
search
of
the
legal
documents
but
they
were
too
late
they
have
long
ago
arrived
in
italy
campeggio
was
careful
enough
to
send
them
secretly
by
his
rudolph
i
often
saw
this
young
man
in
rome
and
heard
him
say
his
father
had
entrusted
him
with
all
his
correspondence
and
despatches
as
he
was
not
certain
what
fate
henry
had
in
store
for
say
replied
young
william
elevating
his
voice
in
order
that
du
bellay
might
hear
him
the
king
has
sent
the
earl
of
wiltshire
to
rome
to
solicit
his
divorce
he
had
better
make
all
these
strangers
leave
who
come
into
our
country
only
to
sow
discord
and
then
gather
the
fruits
of
their
this
speech
although
spoken
indirectly
was
evidently
intended
for
the
two
frenchmen
but
the
genoese
merchant
always
inclined
to
be
suspicious
immediately
applied
it
to
himself
william
he
exclaimed
reddening
with
anger
you
forgotten
that
for
twenty
years
i
have
been
a
commercial
friend
of
your
father
and
if
he
has
made
his
fortune
with
our
velvets
and
silks
to
whom
does
he
owe
it
if
not
to
those
who
by
their
honesty
and
promptness
in
fulfilling
their
engagements
were
the
first
cause
of
his
success
now
because
you
are
able
to
live
without
work
you
take
on
this
insulting
manner
very
insulting
indeed
however
i
give
you
to
understand
that
if
it
suited
me
to
do
it
i
could
make
as
great
a
display
of
luxury
and
wealth
as
yourself
and
can
count
on
my
dresser
as
many
dishes
and
flagons
of
silver
as
you
have
and
if
it
suited
me
to
remain
at
home
there
is
no
necessity
for
me
to
travel
any
more
on
the
merchant
continued
to
boast
of
his
fortune
and
william
began
to
explain
that
his
remarks
were
by
no
means
intended
for
him
when
the
passengers
began
to
cry
out
land
here
is
chelsea
we
land
at
the
rowers
halted
immediately
and
the
little
boats
sent
from
the
shore
came
to
take
off
the
passengers
who
wished
to
land
almost
all
of
them
went
none
remaining
on
the
boat
except
the
ambassador
the
genoese
merchant
and
two
citizens
whose
retiring
and
prudent
character
could
be
read
in
the
quiet
thoughtful
expression
of
their
faces
they
gazed
for
a
long
time
on
the
surrounding
country
at
last
one
of
them
hazarded
the
question
you
know
who
owns
that
white
house
with
the
terraced
garden
extending
down
to
the
bank
of
the
thames
is
the
residence
of
sir
thomas
more
the
new
chancellor
replied
his
companion
methodically
it
does
not
make
much
show
do
you
know
this
new
chancellor
my
faith
no
however
i
saw
him
the
other
day
on
the
square
at
westminster
as
i
was
passing
the
dukes
of
norfolk
and
suffolk
were
conducting
him
with
great
ceremony
to
the
star
chamber
at
least
that
is
what
they
told
me
i
stopped
to
look
at
him
there
was
an
immense
crowd
filling
all
the
square
in
crossing
it
the
duke
of
norfolk
stopped
and
turning
to
the
crowd
before
him
said
the
king
had
instructed
him
to
publicly
proclaim
what
great
and
important
services
sir
thomas
had
rendered
him
in
every
position
he
had
confided
to
his
care
and
it
was
on
that
account
he
esteemed
him
so
highly
and
had
appointed
him
now
to
the
highest
position
in
the
kingdom
because
of
his
virtues
and
the
rare
talents
he
possessed
everybody
listened
and
said
nothing
because
you
know
the
last
is
always
the
best
the
citizen
said
this
in
a
very
low
tone
replied
very
well
he
continued
said
that
while
deeply
grateful
for
his
goodness
and
favors
he
felt
no
less
deeply
convinced
that
the
king
had
rewarded
him
far
beyond
his
merits
in
all
he
had
accomplished
he
had
but
done
his
duty
and
he
greatly
feared
now
that
he
might
not
possess
the
ability
necessary
for
acquitting
himself
of
the
duties
of
so
high
and
important
an
office
and
a
very
singular
thing
for
they
do
not
usually
speak
of
their
predecessors
he
declared
that
he
could
not
rejoice
in
the
honor
conferred
on
him
as
it
recalled
the
name
of
the
wise
and
honorable
prelate
whom
he
had
superseded
on
hearing
that
i
supposed
they
would
hiss
but
not
at
all
he
said
everything
so
well
with
so
much
sincerity
dignity
and
firmness
that
they
applauded
him
with
an
indescribable
enthusiasm
it
seemed
those
who
knew
him
were
never
satisfied
with
praising
him
nobody
they
said
rendered
justice
so
scrupulously
as
he
none
were
so
wise
so
disinterested
in
fact
they
never
ended
the
recital
of
his
said
the
other
in
a
voice
scarcely
audible
while
he
looked
round
to
discover
if
any
one
could
hear
him
will
see
later
if
he
performs
all
these
wonderful
things
and
if
any
one
will
be
able
to
get
near
him
without
paying
even
his
doorkeeper
as
was
the
case
with
the
we
will
see
replied
his
companion
of
these
great
lords
are
worth
much
any
amount
of
but
of
nothing
this
is
not
a
great
lord
answered
the
citizen
well
it
is
all
the
same
as
soon
as
they
rise
they
grow
proud
and
despise
and
scorn
the
people
you
may
believe
if
ever
i
obtain
a
patent
of
nobility
and
become
still
richer
than
i
am
now
i
will
crush
them
beautifully
there
will
not
be
one
who
will
dare
contradict
me
by
my
faith
it
is
a
great
pity
i
had
not
been
born
a
count
or
a
baron
i
should
have
been
so
well
up
to
all
their
impertinences
and
want
of
is
not
very
difficult
replied
his
companion
are
i
think
sufficiently
so
now
for
the
good
of
that
poor
youth
who
wants
to
marry
your
daughter
he
will
lose
his
senses
i
am
afraid
poor
did
you
say
neighbor
replied
the
citizen
feeling
the
blood
mount
to
his
face
you
think
i
will
give
my
daughter
to
a
wretch
who
has
not
a
cent
in
the
world
i
who
have
held
in
my
family
the
right
of
citizenship
from
time
immemorial
my
grandmother
also
told
me
we
have
had
two
aldermen
of
our
name
all
that
counts
you
see
master
allicot
and
if
you
wish
to
remain
my
friend
i
advise
you
not
to
meddle
yourself
with
the
tattle
of
my
wife
and
daughter
on
the
subject
of
that
little
wretch
they
are
putting
it
into
her
head
to
marry
because
in
truth
the
mother
is
as
bad
as
the
daughter
ah
neighbor
these
women
these
women
are
the
plagues
of
our
lives
say
any
more
to
me
about
it
they
will
run
me
distracted
but
they
will
make
nothing
by
it
i
swear
it
neighbor
the
silly
jades
to
dare
speak
to
me
of
such
a
match
hush
say
any
more
to
me
about
it
neighbor
for
it
will
drive
me
mad
the
neighbor
reply
however
because
he
had
been
commissioned
to
use
his
influence
in
softening
the
husband
and
father
in
favor
of
a
young
mechanic
full
of
life
and
health
who
had
no
other
fault
than
that
of
belonging
to
a
class
less
elevated
than
that
of
the
proud
citizen
who
rejected
his
humble
supplications
with
scorn
but
the
of
this
embassy
and
the
termination
of
this
romance
of
the
warehouse
have
been
for
ever
lost
to
history
for
du
bellay
seeing
they
were
almost
in
sight
of
asher
made
them
land
him
and
the
two
honorable
citizens
doubtless
continued
their
journey
and
their
conversation
at
asher
du
bellay
found
everything
just
as
he
expected
the
physicians
surrounded
bed
watching
his
slightest
movement
the
golden
tablets
of
young
anne
boleyn
were
thrown
open
upon
the
coarse
woollen
bedspread
that
covered
the
sick
man
cromwell
walked
the
floor
with
folded
arms
he
approached
the
bed
from
time
to
time
looked
at
wolsey
whose
closed
eyes
and
labored
breathing
betokened
nothing
favorable
then
at
the
golden
tablets
then
at
the
physicians
around
him
he
seemed
to
say
he
going
to
die
and
just
when
he
might
be
so
useful
to
me
on
seeing
du
bellay
enter
his
countenance
lighted
up
he
ran
on
before
him
and
endeavored
to
arouse
wolsey
from
his
stupor
lord
the
ambassador
of
france
he
cried
in
the
ear
of
the
dying
man
but
he
received
no
reply
is
singular
said
the
doctors
can
arouse
and
they
looked
gravely
at
each
other
will
not
die
i
tell
you
he
will
not
die
replied
cromwell
evincing
the
most
impatient
anxiety
he
approached
the
cardinal
and
shook
his
head
well
murmured
the
sick
man
du
bellay
shouted
cromwell
a
second
time
eyes
remained
closed
him
alone
cried
the
physicians
must
not
be
i
think
said
du
bellay
can
tell
him
i
have
been
here
continued
the
ambassador
turning
towards
cromwell
did
not
wish
to
disturb
du
bellay
then
took
his
leave
and
returned
by
the
land
route
to
london
he
encountered
not
far
from
asher
a
party
of
the
old
domestics
whom
the
king
had
sent
to
carry
him
several
of
furniture
and
other
effects
at
the
head
of
this
convoy
rode
cavendish
one
of
the
most
faithful
servants
seeing
du
bellay
they
collected
around
him
and
hastily
inquired
about
their
master
du
bellay
advised
them
to
quicken
their
speed
and
taking
leave
went
on
his
way
thinking
that
the
cardinal
would
not
be
restored
to
favor
and
already
arranging
in
his
mind
another
course
in
which
to
direct
his
diplomatic
steps
for
the
future
he
was
not
mistaken
wolsey
escaped
death
but
only
to
find
himself
surrounded
by
misery
and
abandoned
to
despair
to
be
continued
primitive
civilization
if
our
modern
men
of
science
would
not
travel
out
of
their
sphere
there
would
be
no
war
between
them
and
the
church
in
the
name
of
the
catholic
religion
we
invite
them
to
push
onward
in
the
path
of
scientific
discovery
with
the
utmost
energy
and
ardor
of
which
they
are
capable
but
if
their
discoveries
are
to
have
any
bearing
on
the
truths
of
the
christian
revelation
we
can
accept
nothing
less
than
demonstration
and
they
must
not
credit
science
as
does
tyndall
with
mere
theories
of
speculative
philosophy
with
this
reservation
we
wish
their
labors
all
possible
success
but
if
poor
fallible
reason
whose
discoveries
after
whole
millenniums
of
toil
are
little
better
than
a
record
of
the
blunders
of
one
generation
corrected
by
the
blunders
of
another
and
even
on
the
supposition
that
they
are
all
correct
are
by
comparison
with
what
is
unknown
as
a
drop
of
water
compared
with
the
limitless
ocean
ventures
to
deny
the
existence
of
the
soul
because
it
has
no
lens
powerful
enough
to
bring
it
within
the
cognizance
of
the
senses
its
conclusion
is
no
longer
scientific
the
doctor
has
become
a
quack
the
philosopher
a
fool
if
the
torch
which
the
creator
has
placed
at
the
service
of
his
creature
to
help
him
to
grope
his
way
amidst
the
objects
of
sense
and
to
illuminate
his
faith
is
to
be
flung
in
his
face
because
it
does
not
reveal
the
whole
infinitude
of
the
majesty
of
his
beauty
we
can
only
compassionate
so
childish
a
misuse
of
a
noble
gift
if
natural
philosophy
is
to
rob
the
sensible
creation
of
a
motive
and
end
and
to
proclaim
it
to
be
merely
the
result
of
an
unintelligent
atomic
attraction
and
evolution
of
forces
a
more
intelligent
and
a
more
logical
philosophy
in
harmony
with
the
unquenchable
instinct
of
immortality
within
the
human
soul
casts
from
it
such
pitiful
trifling
with
indignation
and
a
holy
disdain
if
in
short
the
science
of
nature
would
dethrone
creator
and
god
we
address
to
it
the
word
which
he
to
whom
all
true
science
leads
addressed
to
the
ocean
he
placed
in
the
deep
hollows
of
the
earth
thou
shalt
come
and
thou
shalt
go
no
farther
and
here
thou
shalt
break
thy
swelling
physical
science
can
not
contradict
the
divine
revelation
no
discovery
hitherto
made
has
done
so
and
until
one
such
presents
itself
we
are
entitled
to
assume
its
impossibility
as
a
philosophical
axiom
for
this
reason
we
are
of
those
who
would
give
full
rein
to
even
the
speculations
of
experimental
philosophy
so
long
as
they
are
confined
strictly
within
the
domain
of
secondary
causes
or
natural
law
and
do
not
venture
into
a
sphere
of
thought
beyond
the
reach
of
experimental
science
where
they
are
immediately
confronted
with
the
dogmas
of
the
faith
we
have
never
thought
that
the
theory
of
the
evolution
of
species
must
of
necessity
transgress
that
limit
it
has
been
made
to
do
so
by
if
we
may
invent
a
name
for
them
speculative
bigots
who
are
bent
on
extorting
from
natural
phenomena
any
plausible
support
of
the
infidel
prejudices
of
which
they
were
previously
possessed
a
more
intelligent
observation
of
scientific
facts
would
have
saved
them
from
a
ridiculous
extravagance
which
makes
them
resemble
those
afflicted
creatures
whom
we
so
often
meet
with
in
asylums
for
the
insane
who
suppose
themselves
to
be
god
we
must
never
lose
sight
of
the
fact
that
god
can
only
communicate
with
his
creature
in
such
a
way
as
he
can
understand
if
he
were
to
reveal
himself
to
any
of
us
as
he
is
we
should
die
unless
he
supplied
us
with
a
miraculous
capacity
for
supporting
the
vision
if
he
had
inspired
the
historian
of
those
primitive
ages
to
describe
the
astronomical
phenomenon
which
happened
in
the
time
of
joshua
in
the
exact
language
of
physical
science
what
meaning
would
it
have
conveyed
to
people
who
did
not
know
that
the
earth
revolves
around
its
own
axis
and
around
the
sun
if
it
be
objected
why
did
not
the
holy
spirit
use
language
consistent
with
scientific
truth
and
leave
it
to
be
understood
afterwards
in
the
progress
of
science
we
reply
because
it
would
have
thwarted
his
own
designs
to
have
done
so
the
bible
is
a
book
of
instruction
in
truth
out
of
the
reach
of
human
intelligence
not
a
book
of
natural
science
and
it
appeals
to
the
obedience
of
faith
rather
than
to
reason
the
mental
toil
of
scientific
discovery
was
a
part
of
the
punishment
inflicted
on
the
original
transgression
to
anticipate
the
result
of
that
toil
by
thousands
of
years
would
have
been
to
contradict
his
own
dispensation
in
the
same
manner
the
sublime
record
of
the
genesis
of
the
illimitable
universe
which
weaves
its
dance
of
light
in
space
is
told
in
a
few
sentences
the
fiat
of
him
with
whom
one
day
is
as
a
thousand
years
and
a
thousand
years
as
one
day
and
the
successive
order
of
the
creation
that
is
all
time
was
not
then
for
it
was
the
creation
of
time
man
can
conceive
no
ideas
independent
of
time
and
so
days
are
named
but
it
is
evident
that
the
word
may
stand
for
indeterminate
periods
of
time
the
creation
of
light
was
it
can
not
be
doubted
instantaneous
but
that
creation
was
a
law
limitation
relation
succession
whose
working
was
an
evolution
in
successive
orders
or
stages
over
which
presided
the
creator
and
still
presides
father
worketh
hitherto
and
i
each
of
these
was
a
distinct
creation
perfect
in
itself
not
an
evolution
of
species
the
creation
was
progressive
but
not
in
the
sense
of
the
creation
of
every
one
of
its
six
cycles
evolving
out
of
the
preceding
one
for
in
that
case
either
the
lower
would
have
disappeared
or
the
evolution
would
be
still
in
operation
the
firmament
did
not
develop
out
of
light
nor
the
ocean
and
the
dry
land
out
of
the
firmament
nor
were
the
fishes
an
evolution
from
the
nor
the
birds
from
the
trees
and
shrubs
nor
the
wild
beasts
from
the
reeds
of
the
jungle
nor
man
from
the
lower
animals
but
they
were
all
to
be
made
before
his
creation
who
was
the
sum
and
end
of
all
and
the
atmosphere
must
be
created
before
the
birds
the
ocean
before
the
fishes
the
dry
land
before
vegetable
life
and
not
only
was
there
never
any
evolution
of
species
into
other
species
but
the
creation
of
every
separate
species
was
complete
so
that
there
has
never
been
an
evolution
of
any
species
into
a
higher
state
or
condition
there
has
never
been
any
progress
in
that
sense
every
species
including
the
human
being
remains
precisely
as
it
issued
from
the
hand
of
god
when
it
has
not
degenerated
or
disappeared
indeed
the
tendency
of
all
living
things
around
us
is
to
degeneracy
and
decay
whatever
progress
can
be
predicated
of
man
is
of
his
moral
nature
only
and
of
his
knowledge
through
the
divine
revelation
but
even
that
is
not
a
race
progress
an
evolution
of
species
but
an
individual
one
if
this
be
conceded
and
we
think
it
scarcely
admits
of
dispute
we
see
no
danger
to
the
dogmas
of
the
faith
in
allowing
to
the
natural
philosophers
any
length
of
ages
they
may
claim
for
the
creation
of
the
home
of
man
before
he
was
called
into
being
for
whom
it
was
destined
whatever
period
of
time
was
covered
by
those
cycles
of
creation
throughout
them
it
may
be
said
that
he
was
being
made
if
all
was
for
him
and
to
end
in
him
it
was
in
effect
he
who
all
along
was
being
made
yet
the
whole
was
only
a
preparatory
creation
it
was
only
his
body
in
which
all
resulted
body
thou
hast
prepared
for
it
was
when
breathed
into
his
nostrils
the
breath
of
that
man
was
created
it
was
then
he
became
living
the
error
of
the
physicists
who
reject
revelation
is
threefold
they
make
the
body
the
man
they
thus
assign
to
his
body
and
the
inner
principle
which
animates
it
a
simultaneous
beginning
and
joint
development
some
of
them
going
so
far
as
to
make
the
spirit
itself
or
soul
or
whatever
they
call
the
animating
principle
the
spontaneous
product
of
material
forces
and
throwing
back
the
beginning
of
the
evolution
process
into
untold
ages
by
comparison
with
which
the
life
of
an
individual
is
a
scarcely
appreciable
moment
they
suppose
the
process
to
be
still
going
on
as
it
begun
all
this
obviously
contradicts
the
direct
statements
of
revelation
it
is
indeed
shocking
to
mere
human
reason
the
work
of
the
natural
creation
ended
with
the
sixth
day
up
to
that
time
whether
the
periods
were
long
or
short
the
work
was
going
on
but
it
was
complete
when
the
body
which
had
been
prepared
for
him
was
animated
with
the
spirit
of
life
after
that
there
was
no
farther
development
it
is
contrary
to
reason
to
suppose
it
it
is
contrary
to
the
whole
analogy
of
nature
not
an
instance
can
be
adduced
throughout
the
entire
creation
of
one
species
developing
into
another
not
an
instance
even
of
any
species
developing
within
itself
into
a
higher
order
of
being
but
up
to
that
period
of
which
it
is
thus
written
perfecti
sunt

we
may
admit
without
risk
of
heterodoxy
any
doctrine
of
evolution
of
which
the
physicists
may
give
us
a
satisfactory
evidence
the
physicists
in
support
of
their
irrational
theory
of
evolution
maintain
that
the
earliest
developments
of
human
consciousness
were
of
the
lowest
order
and
that
man
has
ever
since
been
gradually
progressing
towards
a
higher
morality
and
loftier
spheres
of
thought
in
this
able
and
interesting
work
father
thébaud
demonstrates
by
an
exhaustive
induction
from
the
history
and
literature
of
all
the
nations
that
the
history
of
mankind
up
to
the
coming
of
christ
instead
of
a
progress
was
a
continual
retrogression
in
his
introductory
chapter
he
establishes
by
proofs
which
should
be
conclusive
to
all
minds
unprepossessed
by
an
arrogant
perversity
that
primitive
man
was
in
possession
of
a
primitive
revelation
in
the
morning
twilight
of
the
ages
as
far
back
as
we
can
see
across
the
flood
up
to
the
very
entrance
to
the
seats
of
innocence
from
which
the
erring
creature
had
been
driven
he
traces
everywhere
those
rites
and
dogmas
in
their
elemental
form
which
in
their
complete
development
and
full
significance
made
known
to
us
by
the
revelation
of
the
fulness
of
time
are
still
of
faith
and
observance
amongst
the
sons
of
god
from
end
to
end
of
the
habitable
globe
this
revelation
did
not
go
beyond
monotheism
because
the
fallen
immortal
had
to
be
prepared
through
long
ages
of
discipline
for
the
revelation
of
the
triune
nature
of
the
godhead
and
of
his
restoration
to
the
forfeited
favor
of
his
father
by
the
incarnation
and
atoning
sacrifice
of
the
eternal
son
we
do
not
remember
to
have
met
before
with
the
ingenious
hypothesis
that
the
configuration
of
the
earth
consisting
of
an
ocean
in
the
midst
of
which
vast
continents
are
islands
evidences
the
design
of
the
creator
to
have
been
that
should
have
intercourse
of
some
kind
with
one
another
and
that
on
the
land
oceans
and
rivers
instead
of
being
primarily
dividing
lines
intended
to
separate
men
from
one
another
had
precisely
for
their
first
object
to
become
highways
and
common
channels
of
intercourse
between
the
various
nations
of
but
our
author
considers
that
the
social
intercommunion
to
which
the
configuration
of
the
earth
was
to
administer
was
not
to
develop
in
the
form
of
universal
republic
but
that
were
to
consent
to
exist
in
larger
or
smaller
groups
each
of
them
surrounded
with
limits
determining
numerous
nationalities
united
in
the
bond
of
religious
uniformity
which
he
terms
patriarchal
catholicity
the
design
of
the
creator
of
universal
brotherhood
amongst
his
creatures
was
not
to
be
fulfilled
before
the
lapse
of
ages
and
throughout
that
dismal
period
it
has
the
appearance
of
being
perpetually
thwarted
by
their
perverseness
the
memories
of
paradise
rapidly
faded
away
amongst
them
after
what
period
of
time
we
are
not
told
the
sons
of
god
committed
a
second
infidelity
by
intermarrying
with
the
daughters
of
men
the
result
was
a
race
of
giants
giants
in
capacity
and
crime
as
well
as
in
bodily
form
whose
existence
universal
tradition
attests
in
almost
open
alliance
with
the
powers
of
darkness
they
sank
with
such
fearful
rapidity
down
the
abyss
of
depravation
dragging
with
them
the
better
portion
of
the
race
that
to
avert
the
triumph
of
hell
and
the
utter
reprobation
of
his
creature
the
offended
creator
buried
the
guilty
memories
of
colossal
crime
beneath
an
universal
deluge
at
whose
subsidence
the
first
civilization
reappeared
on
the
mountains
of
asia
in
all
its
earliest
purity
brought
across
the
forty
extinction
of
life
upon
the
earth
by
the
eight
souls
who
alone
had
turned
a
deaf
ear
to
the
universal
seduction
idea
of
a
gradual
and
deeper
degradation
of
human
kind
says
frederick
schlegel
each
succeeding
age
appears
at
first
sight
not
to
accord
very
well
with
the
testimony
which
sacred
tradition
furnishes
on
primitive
state
for
it
represents
the
two
races
of
the
primitive
world
as
contemporary
and
indeed
seth
the
progenitor
of
the
better
and
nobler
race
of
virtuous
patriarchs
was
much
younger
than
cain
however
this
contradiction
is
only
apparent
if
we
reflect
that
it
was
the
wicked
and
violent
race
which
drew
the
other
into
its
disorders
and
that
it
was
from
this
contamination
a
giant
corruption
sprang
which
continually
increased
till
with
a
trifling
exception
it
pervaded
the
whole
mass
of
mankind
and
till
the
justice
of
god
required
the
extirpation
of
degenerate
humanity
by
one
universal
it
does
not
admit
of
a
doubt
as
our
author
argues
that
with
this
terrible
judgment
began
the
dissolution
of
that
fraternal
unity
which
god
had
intended
should
be
the
happy
lot
of
the
human
family
and
for
which
the
configuration
of
the
earth
was
adapted
the
gigantic
unity
of
crime
was
smitten
to
pieces
in
the
helplessness
of
division
they
who
had
been
brothers
looked
in
one
faces
and
found
them
strange
they
opened
their
lips
and
lo
their
speech
was
to
others
a
jargon
of
unintelligible
sounds
the
one
could
no
more
understand
the
other
than
they
could
the
wolf
or
the
jackal
with
whom
they
both
began
to
be
mutually
classed
the
intercommunion
of
families
of
men
with
one
another
was
rudely
snapped
asunder
there
were
no
means
of
common
action
there
was
no
medium
of
common
thought
the
fragments
into
which
the
human
family
were
smitten
went
off
in
different
directions
to
post
themselves
in
attitudes
of
mutual
distrust
and
defiance
behind
mountains
or
morasses
on
the
skirts
of
forests
the
borders
of
torrents
or
in
the
security
of
measureless
deserts
where
their
practised
eyes
swept
the
horizon
intercommunion
was
rendered
still
more
impossible
by
the
mutual
antagonism
fear
and
hatred
that
prevailed
and
the
very
ocean
instead
of
being
a
pathway
for
the
interchange
of
social
life
became
a
formidable
barrier
between
man
and
man
the
dangers
to
be
encountered
on
the
lands
to
which
the
winds
might
bear
them
were
more
to
be
dreaded
than
the
terrible
phantoms
which
issuing
ever
and
anon
from
the
home
of
the
storms
raged
across
the
ocean
and
lashed
into
merciless
fury
its
roaring
waves
memory
had
lost
in
the
primeval
language
the
key
of
its
as
years
went
on
amidst
the
exacting
preoccupations
of
new
ways
of
life
new
surroundings
new
ways
of
expressing
their
thoughts
and
their
increasing
tribal
or
race
isolation
the
ideas
upon
which
their
primeval
civilization
had
been
based
grew
dimmer
and
dimmer
until
they
finally
disappeared
establish
this
in
detail
says
the
author
of
the
purpose
of
this
and
this
purpose
appears
to
us
to
have
been
accomplished
in
the
most
convincing
manner
the
scientists
maintain
and
it
is
necessary
to
their
evolution
theory
that
man
began
with
barbarism
and
moved
slowly
onwards
in
the
gradual
stages
of
their
tedious
evolution
process
towards
what
they
call
civilization
which
is
to
lead
we
believe
in
the
future
developments
of
the
evolution
to
some
loftier
state
and
condition
of
the
nature
of
which
they
supply
us
with
not
the
faintest
idea
this
notion
of
the
original
barbarism
of
man
is
one
of
those
fallacies
which
get
imbedded
in
the
general
belief
of
mankind
one
knows
not
how
strange
to
say
it
has
been
very
generally
acquiesced
in
for
no
manner
of
reason
and
it
is
only
of
late
years
that
thoughtful
men
outside
of
the
faith
have
come
to
suspect
that
it
is
not
quite
the
truism
they
had
imagined
there
is
a
reason
for
this
the
attenuation
of
the
claims
of
another
world
on
the
life
and
on
the
conduct
of
men
effected
by
the
great
revolt
of
the
xvith
century
and
the
keener
relish
for
the
things
of
this
life
which
consequently
ensued
have
infected
the
sentiments
of
mankind
with
an
exaggerated
sense
of
the
importance
of
material
objects
and
pursuits
thus
the
idea
of
civilization
instead
of
being
that
of
the
highest
development
of
the
moral
and
whole
inner
being
of
social
man
is
limited
to
the
discovery
of
all
the
unnumbered
ways
and
means
of
administering
to
the
embellishment
and
luxury
of
his
actual
life
his
very
mental
progress
as
they
term
it
with
extraordinary
incorrectness
is
only
regarded
in
this
light
speculators
on
the
stone
bronze
and
iron
ages
writes
our
author
civilization
almost
exclusively
in
the
enjoyment
by
man
of
a
multitude
of
little
inventions
of
his
own
many
of
which
certainly
are
derived
from
the
knowledge
and
use
of
metals
any
nation
deprived
of
them
can
not
be
called
civilized
in
their
opinion
because
reduced
to
a
very
simple
state
of
life
which
they
say
unhesitatingly
is
barbarism
in
fact
depends
much
more
on
moral
degradation
than
on
physical
want
of
comfort
and
when
we
come
to
describe
patriarchal
society
our
readers
will
understand
how
a
tribe
or
nation
may
deserve
to
be
placed
on
an
exalted
round
of
the
social
ladder
although
living
exclusively
on
the
fruits
of
the
earth
and
cultivating
it
with
a
simple
wooden
father
thébaud
next
proceeds
with
convincing
force
to
demolish
the
argument
in
behalf
of
the
gradual
evolution
of
the
entire
race
from
a
state
of
barbarism
which
the
evolutionists
allege
to
have
been
inevitably
its
first
stage
of
intellectual
consciousness
drawn
from
the
discovery
of
human
skeletons
in
caves
and
in
the
drift
of
long
past
ages
in
juxtaposition
with
instruments
of
rude
construction
belonging
to
the
palæolithic
age
and
fossil
remains
of
extinct
animals
this
argument
has
always
appeared
to
us
so
feeble
as
to
seem
a
mystery
how
it
could
be
employed
by
learned
men
unless
in
support
of
some
preconceived
opinion
which
they
would
maintain
at
all
hazards
the
occasional
outbreaks
of
the
mississippi
the
terrible
devastation
effected
by
the
mere
overflow
of
the
garonne
in
the
south
of
france
give
but
a
faint
idea
of
what
changes
must
have
been
effected
upon
the
crust
of
the
earth
by
the
subsidence
of
the
huge
mass
of
water
which
must
have
been
at
least
eight
or
nine
times
as
ponderous
as
all
the
oceans
which
have
since
lain
at
peace
in
its
hollows
as
the
prodigious
volumes
of
water
sucked
and
drawn
hither
and
thither
as
they
hurried
to
their
rushed
in
furious
tides
and
vast
whirlpools
of
terrific
force
they
must
have
torn
up
the
crust
like
a
rotten
rag
whole
valleys
must
have
been
scooped
out
down
to
the
very
root
of
the
mountains
and
of
all
kinds
deposited
everywhere
in
all
kinds
of
confusion
so
as
to
afford
no
secure
data
whatever
for
chronological
or
zoölogical
or
geological
deductions
still
more
conclusive
is
father
refutation
of
the
argument
in
behalf
of
the
evolution
theory
drawn
from
the
discovery
of
stone
implements
of
rude
construction
in
what
is
asserted
to
be
the
earliest
drift
deposit
of
iron
in
the
later
strata
and
bronze
in
the
latest
to
make
this
argument
of
any
force
it
must
be
proved
that
these
periods
evolved
regularly
and
invariably
from
one
another
throughout
the
whole
race
of
mankind
their
as
father
thébaud
has
it
must
be
indisputably
proved
but
this
is
just
what
it
can
not
be
on
the
contrary
this
last
age
in
which
we
live
in
the
previous
ages
which
we
can
know
by
clear
and
unobjectionable
history
finally
in
the
dimmest
ages
of
antiquity
of
which
we
possess
any
sufficiently
reliable
records
the
three
of
stone
bronze
and
iron
have
always
subsisted
simultaneously
and
consequently
are
no
more
when
we
speak
of
the
aggregate
of
mankind
but
they
are
only
three
aspects
of
the
same
specific
to
the
same
effect
is
the
argument
that
artistic
distance
between
the
rough
palæolithic
flints
and
the
polished
stones
of
the
neolithic
period
exhibits
a
gap
which
tells
but
indifferently
in
favor
of
the
believers
in
continuous
progress
either
there
has
been
a
strange
severment
of
continuity
or
the
men
of
the
first
period
were
better
artists
and
not
such
rough
barbarians
as
the
remains
we
possess
of
them
seem
to
the
scientific
arguments
however
of
father
thébaud
in
disproof
of
the
alleged
original
barbarism
of
the
human
race
satisfactory
as
they
are
as
far
as
they
go
are
little
more
than
introductory
to
the
more
conclusive
historical
argument
which
constitutes
the
body
of
his
valuable
and
very
opportune
work
best
efforts
to
ascertain
the
origin
of
man
he
justly
remarks
primeval
religion
by
the
facts
of
geology
or
zoölogy
can
at
best
only
result
in
more
or
less
probable
in
an
argument
of
this
nature
our
author
begins
as
was
to
have
been
expected
from
that
philosophical
impassive
and
ancient
people
who
inhabit
the
triangular
peninsula
which
stretches
out
from
no
vast
distance
from
the
original
seat
of
the
renewed
race
of
man
into
the
southeastern
atlantic
there
they
have
dwelt
from
times
beyond
which
history
does
not
reach
inheriting
a
civilization
which
dates
from
the
subsiding
deluge
whose
gradual
decadence
can
be
distinctly
traced
they
are
in
possession
of
the
earliest
writings
that
exist
unless
the
books
of
moses
or
the
book
of
job
are
older
which
we
do
not
think
it
is
rash
to
say
is
at
least
doubtful
we
find
ourselves
in
the
presence
of
the
noblest
truths
of
even
supernatural
religion
mingled
it
is
true
with
the
gross
pantheistical
absurdities
which
had
already
begun
to
deface
the
primitive
revelation
and
to
deteriorate
the
primitive
civilization
the
general
process
throughout
the
world
was
no
doubt
as
father
thébaud
describes
a
period
of
universal
monotheism
the
nations
began
to
worship
works
of
god
and
fell
generally
into
a
broad
pantheism
they
took
subsequently
a
second
step
perfectly
well
marked
later
on
in
hindostan
central
asia
egypt
greece
a
step
originating
everywhere
in
the
imagination
of
poets
materializing
god
bringing
him
down
to
human
nature
and
weakness
and
finally
idealizing
and
deifying
his
supposed
representations
in
statuary
and
but
we
must
venture
to
differ
from
father
thébaud
as
to
the
religion
of
the
hindoos
having
ever
taken
the
latter
step
the
form
its
pantheism
took
in
consequence
of
its
tenets
of
the
incarnations
of
vishnu
the
second
god
of
the
triad
and
of
metempsychosis
was
a
worship
of
animals
and
especially
of
the
cow
a
worship
which
prevails
to
this
day
but
this
was
not
the
gross
idolatry
of
the
greeks
and
romans
but
rather
a
respect
a
in
consequence
of
the
supposed
presence
in
the
former
of
departed
friends
and
of
the
incarnation
of
the
divinity
in
the
latter
their
idols
are
huge
material
representations
of
the
might
and
repose
which
are
the
chief
attributes
of
the
hindoo
deity
or
of
animals
with
which
the
ideas
were
especially
associated
but
we
do
not
think
they
ever
were
worshipped
as
was
for
example
diana
by
the
ephesians
be
this
as
it
may
it
in
no
way
affects
the
incontrovertible
testimony
which
father
thébaud
adduces
to
the
high
state
of
civilization
of
this
remarkable
people
fifteen
hundred
years
at
all
events
before
christ
he
proves
it
from
their
social
institutions
which
issued
from
a
kind
of
tribal
municipality
closely
resembling
the
celtic
clans
but
without
the
principle
of
superseding
the
rightful
heir
to
a
deceased
by
another
son
in
consequence
of
certain
disqualifications
and
that
of
the
redistribution
of
land
which
were
the
bane
of
celtic
institutions
the
caste
restrictions
our
author
shows
from
the
laws
of
menu
were
not
nearly
so
rigorous
in
those
primitive
ages
and
from
the
same
source
he
exhibits
undeniable
proof
of
that
purity
of
morals
which
evidences
the
highest
stage
of
civilization
and
which
has
sunk
gradually
down
to
the
vicious
barbarism
of
the
present
day
we
suspect
however
that
this
latter
has
been
somewhat
exaggerated
it
is
certainly
our
impression
taken
from
works
written
by
those
who
have
lived
for
years
in
familiar
intercourse
with
the
people
that
amongst
the
hindoo
women
there
still
lingers
conspicuous
evidence
of
the
purity
of
morals
which
was
universal
amongst
them
in
the
beginning
of
their
history
it
might
have
been
added
moreover
that
the
laws
of
menu
in
addition
to
their
high
morality
display
a
knowledge
of
finance
and
political
economy
of
the
science
of
government
and
of
the
art
of
developing
the
resources
of
a
people
which
indicate
a
very
high
state
of
civilization
indeed
it
is
impossible
for
us
within
the
limits
assigned
us
to
follow
father
thébaud
through
an
argument
consisting
exclusively
of
learned
detail
our
readers
if
they
would
have
any
proper
appreciation
of
it
must
consult
the
work
itself
we
remark
merely
that
starting
from
the
admitted
fact
that
the
vedas
contain
the
doctrine
of
plain
and
pure
monotheism
and
that
in
those
distant
ages
were
promulgated
and
believed
far
transcend
all
the
most
solemn
teaching
of
the
greatest
philosophers
who
flourished
in
the
following
ages
and
which
yield
only
to
the
sublime
and
exquisitely
refined
teachings
of
incarnate
wisdom
our
author
traces
the
inroads
of
pantheism
from
the
time
when
the
doctrine
recently
revived
by
men
once
christians
of
an
was
openly
proclaimed
and
it
was
asserted
that
our
own
is
a
from
the
fire
that
god
is
beings
and
beings
are
and
he
traces
elaborately
the
change
through
the
several
mystical
works
of
the
philosophical
brahmins
subsequent
to
the
vedas
buddhism
is
a
comparatively
modern
development
we
doubt
its
being
any
form
of
hindooism
whatever
it
appears
to
us
to
be
rather
the
earliest
development
of
that
spirit
of
hostility
to
the
truths
of
the
christian
revelation
which
began
its
work
almost
at
their
very
cradle
that
abject
principle
of
materialism
which
after
having
dragged
down
the
vast
populations
of
china
and
of
north
and
western
india
to
the
lowest
depths
of
mental
and
moral
degradation
of
which
human
nature
is
susceptible
is
now
sweeping
over
christendom
and
threatening
to
if
it
were
possible
the
very
father
next
chapter
is
devoted
to
a
historical
review
of
the
primeval
religion
and
its
decline
in
central
asia
and
africa
and
here
the
proof
is
more
overwhelming
if
possible
than
in
the
case
of
india
as
to
the
monotheism
of
the
great
doctor
if
we
may
give
him
such
a
title
of
the
ancient
east
and
of
the
zends
there
can
be
no
manner
of
doubt
nay
the
doctrine
of
the
resurrection
of
the
body
is
clearly
contained
in
the
most
authentic
part
of
the
there
is
also
that
august
personage
apart
from
all
superior
beings
under
god
stands
between
god
and
man
shows
the
way
to
heaven
and
pronounces
judgment
upon
human
actions
after
death
guards
with
his
drawn
sword
the
whole
world
against
the
demons
has
his
own
light
from
inside
and
from
outside
is
decorated
with
our
author
makes
zoroaster
at
the
latest
a
contemporary
of
moses
and
justly
observes
that
the
the
thoughts
of
men
very
near
the
origin
of
our
now
the
magnificent
eloquence
and
profound
truth
of
the
thoughts
we
meet
rivalling
at
times
the
book
of
job
the
beauty
of
the
prayers
and
the
elaborate
splendor
of
the
ritual
testify
to
a
very
different
state
of
things
in
those
earliest
days
from
that
alleged
by
the
evolutionists
father
thébaud
decides
the
zends
to
be
vedic
and
not
persian
and
no
doubt
in
the
remarkable
form
and
construction
of
the
poems
dramatic
and
mostly
in
the
form
of
dialogue
in
the
tone
of
thought
and
leading
religious
ideas
they
closely
resemble
the
hindoo
vedas
but
it
is
our
impression
that
we
do
not
find
in
the
writings
of
zoroaster
that
perpetual
insistence
on
the
necessity
of
absorption
into
the
deity
which
characterizes
the
hindoo
poems
the
for
example
it
would
appear
that
the
persians
occupied
a
special
place
in
the
dispensation
of
god
in
the
ancient
world
the
holy
spirit
in
the
prophecies
speaks
of
servant
cyrus
whom
i
have
chosen
and
it
is
certain
that
the
pure
monotheistic
worship
was
preserved
longer
in
persia
than
in
any
nation
of
antiquity
except
the
jewish
its
corruption
was
into
dualism
by
which
the
spirit
of
evil
as
in
the
indian
was
invested
with
almost
power
with
the
spirit
of
good
but
for
full
information
on
this
important
and
interesting
subject
we
must
refer
the
reader
to
father
thébaud
himself
our
limits
do
not
admit
of
our
giving
scarcely
the
faintest
outline
of
our
argument
in
proof
of
the
monotheism
of
pelasgic
greece
and
its
gradual
degradation
to
a
sensual
and
idolatrous
anthropomorphism
in
hellenic
and
heroic
greece
the
substantial
genuineness
of
the
orphic
literature
he
successfully
establishes
as
well
as
the
similarity
of
its
doctrines
to
those
of
the
vedas
from
which
he
draws
the
obvious
inference
that
the
two
came
from
the
same
source
and
that
that
branch
of
the
aryan
family
carried
with
them
to
their
more
distant
settlements
traditions
of
the
primitive
revelation
so
conspicuous
in
the
persian
and
hindoo
mystic
epics
but
much
defaced
and
distorted
in
the
course
of
their
long
and
toilsome
migrations
if
monotheism
ever
prevailed
in
pelasgic
greece
its
reign
was
short
indeed
to
orpheus
himself
are
ascribed
pantheistic
doctrines
it
was
the
poets
who
ushered
in
that
special
form
of
idolatry
which
took
possession
of
greece
the
worship
of
the
human
being
deified
with
all
his
infirmities
the
of
the
gods
as
father
thébaud
calls
it
and
the
chief
sinner
on
this
score
was
homer
the
first
and
greatest
of
them
all
yet
did
that
unseen
world
of
the
greeks
that
sensuous
nay
vicious
idolatry
which
peopled
the
ocean
and
the
mountains
and
the
forests
with
gods
and
imagined
a
divinity
for
every
fountain
and
every
grove
and
every
valley
and
every
rill
with
its
superior
deities
up
to
the
supreme
father
of
olympus
himself
subject
to
that
forlorn
solution
of
the
riddle
of
fate
bear
witness
from
olympus
and
from
hades
and
from
the
realms
of
the
sea
to
the
primitive
revelation
it
bore
witness
to
a
civilization
from
which
that
degradation
of
the
ideas
of
god
to
the
level
of
humanity
in
spite
of
its
artistic
grace
and
poetic
feeling
deformed
however
by
a
filthy
lasciviousness
with
its
short
period
of
literary
splendor
and
of
exalted
philosophy
ending
with
the
sophistical
negations
of
scepticism
was
a
fall
and
not
a
progress
for
all
this
precious
fragments
of
a
primitive
revelation
are
found
as
father
thébaud
truly
observes
through
the
writings
of
nearly
all
ancient
greek
and
latin
philosophers
and
his
two
chapters
on
this
subject
chapter
vii
on
philosophy
as
a
channel
of
tradition
and
chapter
viii
on
greek
and
latin
poets
as
guardians
of
are
perhaps
the
most
interesting
part
of
his
most
interesting
and
instructive
work
they
embrace
a
subject
which
has
always
appeared
to
us
as
more
worthy
of
learned
labor
than
any
other
which
could
be
named
that
life
would
be
well
spent
which
should
devote
itself
to
collecting
all
these
fragments
of
traditionary
truth
from
all
literatures
such
a
work
would
not
turn
back
the
flood
of
rationalism
whose
first
risings
we
owe
to
greece
for
it
is
rather
moral
than
intellectual
but
it
would
materially
obstruct
it
and
would
rescue
from
it
many
souls
which
might
otherwise
be
lured
to
their
destruction
by
the
feeble
echoes
of
the
sophists
and
aristophanes
which
beginning
with
voltaire
are
now
multiplying
through
all
the
rationalistic
press
of
the
world
meanwhile
we
cordially
commend
father
work
on
to
the
attentive
study
of
all
who
wish
for
solid
information
and
sagacious
criticism
on
a
subject
which
appears
to
us
without
wishing
in
the
least
to
underrate
scientific
investigation
to
be
more
interesting
and
more
important
than
all
or
any
of
the
discoveries
of
physical
science
these
as
has
been
proved
of
late
years
may
be
turned
against
the
truth
and
become
thus
a
means
of
darkening
instead
of
enlightening
the
soul
at
the
best
be
they
correct
or
erroneous
great
or
small
many
or
few
they
can
not
add
an
inch
to
our
stature
or
a
day
to
our
lives
they
do
not
even
add
to
our
happiness
but
a
false
science
one
which
would
assign
to
each
of
us
an
insignificant
phenomenal
existence
whose
individuality
will
disappear
at
the
end
of
its
few
days
of
living
consciousness
in
an
universal
whole
in
an
eternal
state
of
progress
is
as
fatal
to
human
happiness
as
anything
can
be
short
of
the
abyss
of
reprobation
more
consoling
as
it
is
more
in
accordance
with
right
reason
is
the
testimony
which
comes
to
us
in
one
vast
unison
from
all
the
ages
that
the
history
of
the
race
is
one
of
decadence
not
of
progress
the
sentence
passed
was
death
the
road
to
death
is
decadence
the
way
is
rounded
there
is
a
movement
onward
and
a
growth
of
life
until
the
descent
begins
which
lands
us
in
dissolution
but
every
moment
from
the
first
cry
of
infancy
is
a
step
nearer
to
death
we
are
every
one
of
us
dying
every
day
and
a
movement
towards
death
is
not
progress
individual
experience
joins
its
voice
to
that
of
universal
history
in
testimony
of
this
the
revelation
of
christ
has
put
us
in
possession
of
the
highest
and
certain
truth
it
has
given
us
a
more
exalted
moral
and
has
recast
our
nature
in
a
higher
nay
in
a
divine
mould
we
are
still
dying
every
day
but
the
certain
hope
of
a
joyful
resurrection
has
deprived
death
of
its
agonizing
sting
and
made
it
like
sleep
a
source
of
happiness
instead
of
despair
but
this
is
nothing
like
the
progress
of
which
the
sceptics
prate
it
is
a
supernatural
stage
in
the
dispensation
of
god
for
the
renewal
of
his
fallen
creature
predetermined
before
all
time
his
own
part
in
it
the
natural
order
is
one
long
history
of
decadence
there
has
been
the
ebb
and
flow
the
rising
to
fall
of
all
movement
but
decadence
has
all
along
triumphed
over
progress
amidst
what
a
decadence
are
we
now
living
from
the
promising
progress
of
the
middle
ages
and
we
are
bid
to
expect
so
terrific
a
retrogression
before
the
consummation
of
all
things
that
the
elect
shall
scarcely
be
it
is
the
witness
of
all
the
ages
human
progress
ebbing
and
flowing
but
on
the
whole
the
flow
does
not
overtake
the
ebb
the
ocean
of
life
has
been
ever
ebbing
into
its
eternal
abysses
and
will
ebb
leaving
behind
it
a
dry
and
barren
waste
until
the
morning
of
eternity
shall
break
over
the
withdrawing
night
of
time
chaos
shall
be
for
ever
sealed
in
the
confusion
and
sadness
of
its
darkness
and
the
final
word
shall
go
forth
of
which
the
sublime
physical
law
was
only
a
type

a
shadow

stood
at
the
window
of
the
great
hall
of
her

waiting
for
the
coach
which
was
to
take
her
to
a
some
leagues
distant
where
she
was
to
grace

grand
entertainment

to
be
kept
for
a
whole
night
by

hosts

especial

was
clouded
as
she
waited
in

stately

that

afternoon
and
she
listened
with
a
pained
expression
to
the
sound
of
a
footstep
overhead
pacing
steadily
up

down

touched
a
bell

said
to
the
servant

answered
it
i
wish
to
see
him
again
before

and
soon
down
the
winding
stairway
she
watched
a
young
man
come
with
the
same
steady
pace
which
might
have
been
heard
overhead
for
a
past
no
need
to
ask
the
relationship
between
the
two
black
waving

broad

the

these
were

from
his
queenly
mother
but
the
headstrong
pride
and
excessive
love
which
shone
from
her
eyes
as
he
came
in
sight
met
eyes
very
different
from
them
large
and
black
indeed
they
were
but
their
intense
look
however
deep
the
passion
it
bespoke
told
of
an
unearthly
passion
and
a
fire
that
is
divine
heinrich
love
his
mother
said

answered
the
caressing
diminutive
sounding
strangely
as
addressed
to
her
in
her
pomp
of

stately
presence
said
i

if
you
must
stay
from
any
place
better
that
than
some
others
there
are
no
maidens
there
i
care
for
my
she
watched
the
calm
forehead
contract
as
she
spoke
as
ever
she
exclaimed
never
hear
woman
mentioned
without
a
frown
you
are
no
monk
yet
child
at
your
twentieth
year
nor
ever
shall
be
if
i
can
help
it
it
is
enough
for
me
surely
to
have
given
two
sons
to
the
priesthood
without
yielding
up
my
last
one
my
hope
and
my
heinrich
made
no
answer
for
the
sound
of
the
was
heard
and
he
offered
his
mother
his
hand
led
her
down
the
steps
and
placed
her
in
the
coach
she
drew
him
towards
her
and
kissed
him
passionately
my
dearest
she
said
count
the
minutes
till
we
meet
and
she
never
ceased
to
watch
him
as
long
as
the
mansion
was
visible
he
was
a
sight
of
which
many
a
mother
might
have
been
proud
as
he
stood
there
bare
headed
the
winter
sun
lighting
his
face
the
winter
wind
lifting
his
dark
locks
the
fresh
bloom
of
youth
enhancing
his
peculiar
beauty
his
mother
sighed
deeply
as
the
coach
turned
a
corner
which
hid
him
from
her
view
a
sigh
often
repeated
during
the
course
of
her
journey
it
was
a
full
hour
before
she
was
out
of
her
own
domains
though
the
horses
sped
swiftly
over
the
frozen
ground
all
those
broad
acres
all
that
noble
woodland
all
those
peasant
homes
were
hers
and
for
miles
behind
her
the
land
stretching
north
and
west
belonged
with
it
for
she
had
married
the
owner
of
the
next
estate
and
widowed
held
it
for
her
son
but
at
her
death
all
these
possessions
must
be
divided
among
distant
unknown
kinsmen
if
heinrich
persisted
in
the
desire
which
had
been
his
from
early
boyhood
to
become
a
monk
his
whole
heart
was
set
against
it
her
aim
in
life
was
to
find
for
him
a
wife
whom
he
would
love
and
whom
he
would
bring
to
their
home
she
longed
to
hold
before
her
death
her
son
on
her
knee
the
coach
stopped
as
the
sun
was
setting
and
at
the
palace
door
too
eager
for
a
sight
of
her
to
wait
in
courtly
etiquette
within
host
and
hostess
stood
ready
to
greet
this
friend
of
a
lifetime
heinrich
they
cried
laughing
truant
always
and
we
have
that
with
us
which
will
make
you
wish
him
here
no
matter
what
you
will
see
in
and
in
time
she
saw
indeed
going
slowly
up
the
marble
stairs
a
later
a
vision
of
magnificent
beauty
with
her
ermine
mantle
wrapped
about
her
the
hood
fallen
back
from
her
regal
head
the
eyes
with
the
pained
look
of
disappointment
and
longing
still
lingering
in
them
in
spite
of
the
loving
welcomes
lavished
upon
her
she
came
in
a
turn
of
the
stairs
upon
another
vision
of
beauty
radiant
as
her
own
and
extremely
opposite
coming
slowly
down
towards
her
was
a
young
girl
tall
and
slight
with
a
skin
of
dazzling
fairness
where
the
blue
veins
in
temple
and
neck
were
plain
to
see
a
delicate
tint
like
upon
the
cheek
great
waves
of
fair
hair
sending
back
a
glint
of
gold
to
the
torches
just
lighted
in
the
hall
eyes
very
large
and
so
deeply
set
that
at
first
their
violet
blue
seemed
black
eyes
meek
and
downcast
and
tender
as
a
but
in
them
too
a
look
of
pain
and
yearning
the
face
at
first
view
was
like
that
of
an
innocent
child
but
beneath
its
youthfulness
lay
an
expression
which
bespoke
a
wealth
of
love
and
strength
and
patience
unawakened
as
yet
but
of
unusual
force
skilled
to
read
character
by
years
of
experience
in
palaces
madame
the
countess
read
her
well
so
far
as
she
could
read
at
all
evidently
the
maiden
saw
nothing
that
was
before
her
but
madame
held
her
breath
in
surprise
and
delight
and
stood
still
waiting
her
approach
not
till
she
came
close
to
her
did
the
girl
look
up
then
she
too
stopped
with
a
startled
and
at
sight
of
the
timid
lovely
eyes
at
the
sound
of
the
voice
like
a
flute
like
water
rippling
softly
like
a
south
wind
sighing
in
the
seaside
pines
madame
opened
her
arms
and
caught
the
stranger
to
her
heart
child
my
child
she
cried
beautiful
you
are
madame
the
girl
panted
in
amazement
carried
away
in
her
turn
at
the
sudden
sight
of
this
lovely
lady
who
she
thought
could
be
in
her
regal
beauty
and
attire
no
less
than
a
princess
sees
herself
surely
the
countess
laughed
outright
at
the
artless
undesigned
compliment
as
charming
as
beautiful
she
said
must
see
more
of
you
my
then
kissing
the
cheek
red
now
as
damask
roses
she
passed
on
in
the
hall
above
her
hostess
stood
with
an
arch
smile
on
her
lips
gertrude
we
planned
it
well
she
said
and
i
have
been
watching
for
that
meeting
it
was
a
brilliant
who
is
she
wilhelmina
tell
me
quickly
she
is
loveliness
but
a
short
story
dear
we
found
her
in
halle
her
name
is
elizabeth
wessenberg
she
is
but
her
family
are
strict
lutherans
she
timid
precious
little
dove
became
a
catholic
by
some
good
grace
of
the
good
god
but
it
was
a
lonely
life
and
i
begged
her
off
from
it
for
a
while
oh
but
her
parents
winced
to
see
her
go
they
hate
the
name
even
of
catholic
that
is
all
only
she
sings
like
a
lark
and
she
hardly
knows
what
to
make
of
her
new
life
and
faith
it
is
so
strange
to
is
all
thanks
wilhelmina
i
will
be
with
you
soon
i
long
to
see
her
once
all
that
evening
the
countess
kept
elizabeth
near
her
and
every
hour
her
admiration
increased
a
maiden
so
beautiful
yet
so
ignorant
of
her
own
charms
so
unworldly
so
innocent
she
had
never
seen
alone
in
her
room
that
night
she
fell
trembling
upon
her
knees
poor
passionate
mother
before
the
statue
of
the
holy
mother
bearing
the
divine
son
in
her
arms
and
she
held
up
her
hands
and
prayed
aloud
have
found
her
at
last
she
cried
child
who
has
won
her
way
into
my
heart
at
once
with
no
effort
of
her
own
a
pearl
among
all
pearls
one
whom
my
boy
love
lord
jesus
have
i
not
given
thee
two
sons
give
me
now
one
son
to
keep
for
my
own
and
not
for
thee
grant
that
he
may
love
this
precious
creature
fit
for
him
as
though
thou
thyself
hadst
made
her
for
him
even
as
eve
was
made
for
and
then
she
covered
her
face
and
sobbed
and
pleaded
with
long
wordless
prayers
the
next
day
saw
her
on
her
homeward
way
but
not
alone
she
had
coaxed
in
her
irresistible
fashion
till
she
had
obtained
for
herself
from
her
friend
a
part
of
visit
and
elizabeth
felt
as
if
she
were
living
in
a
dream
there
in
the
costly
coach
wrapped
in
furs
and
watched
by
those
beautiful
eyes
constantly
the
countess
talked
with
her
leading
the
conversation
delicately
in
such
a
manner
that
she
found
out
much
in
regard
to
home
and
penetrated
into
her
hidden
sorrows
in
regard
to
the
coldness
and
lack
of
sympathy
there
and
it
needed
no
words
to
tell
that
this
was
a
heart
which
craved
sympathy
and
love
most
keenly
which
longed
for
something
higher
and
stronger
than
itself
to
lean
upon
every
time
she
looked
at
the
sensitive
face
endowed
with
such
exquisite
refinement
of
beauty
every
time
the
childlike
yet
longing
unsatisfied
eyes
met
hers
every
time
the
musical
voice
fell
upon
her
ears
fearing
ever
an
echo
of
that
same
craving
for
something
more
and
better
than
the
girl
had
yet
known
throbbed
towards
her
and
it
seemed
to
her
that
she
could
hardly
wait
for
the
blessing
which
she
had
persuaded
herself
was
surely
coming
to
her
at
last
now
and
then
she
spoke
of
the
country
through
which
they
passed
and
to
elizabeth
it
was
almost
incredible
that
such
wealth
could
belong
to
one
person
only
now
and
then
she
spoke
of
in
a
tone
of
exultant
love
and
then
elizabeth
trembled
a
little
for
she
dreaded
to
meet
this
stranger
very
grand
and
proud
she
fancied
him
one
who
would
hardly
notice
at
all
a
person
so
insignificant
as
herself
is
the
village
chapel
elizabeth
madame
said
as
the
coach
stopped
suddenly
you
scold
my
little
one
if
i
go
in
for
a
minute
to
the
house
or
perhaps
you
would
like
to
visit
the
blessed
sacrament
while
i
am
gone
yes
that
was
what
elizabeth
would
like
indeed
and
there
she
knelt
and
prayed
never
dreaming
how
much
was
being
said
about
her
only
next
door
madame
exclaimed
impetuously
to
the
priest
who
rose
to
greet
her
must
have
mass
said
for
my
intention
every
morning
for
a
week
see
here
is
a
part
only
of
my
and
she
laid
a
heavy
purse
upon
the
table
god
grant
my
prayer
it
shall
be
doubled
answers
can
not
be
bought
madame
the
priest
said
sadly
can
they
be
must
be
this
time
then
father
you
must
make
my
intention
your
own
will
you
not
will
you
not
for
this
once
father
is
it
then
my
daughter
do
not
be
angry
it
is
the
old
hunger
wrought
up
to
desperation
i
can
not
give
my
boy
to
be
a
monk
the
face
darkened
no
madame
hurried
on
is
too
much
to
ask
of
me
and
now
i
have
found
a
bride
for
him
at
last
she
waits
for
me
in
the
chapel
fair
and
pure
as
the
lilies
i
am
taking
her
home
in
heinrich
know
of
this
one
word
he
can
not
fail
to
love
her
when
he
sees
her
it
is
for
this
i
ask
your
the
priest
pushed
away
the
purse
will
have
none
of
this
he
said
is
far
better
to
see
my
poor
suffer
than
that
this
unrighteous
deed
should
be
done
you
call
yourself
a
catholic
and
pride
yourself
because
your
house
was
always
catholic
and
yet
you
dare
say
that
anything
is
too
much
for
god
to
ask
of
you
i
am
an
old
man
madame
and
have
had
many
souls
to
deal
with
but
i
never
yet
saw
one
whose
vocation
was
more
plain
than
to
the
entire
service
of
church
will
you
dare
run
counter
to
will
father
it
can
not
be
his
will
our
very
name
would
die
out
our
heritage
pass
from
us
suppose
it
does
who
shall
promise
you
that
if
heinrich
marries
there
shall
ever
be
child
of
his
to
fill
his
place
and
what
place
and
name
and
heritage
madame
that
which
death
or
war
or
a
caprice
may
snatch
away
in
a
moment
but
your
spiritual
heritage
shall
never
die
what
mother
on
earth
but
might
envy
you
if
you
give
your
three
sons
your
all
to
god
many
are
the
children
of
the
desolate
more
than
of
her
that
hath
an
husband
saith
the
lord
maketh
a
barren
woman
to
dwell
in
a
house
the
joyful
mother
of
children
there
is
a
place
and
a
name
within
his
walls
better
than
sons
and
daughters
do
you
dream
what
risk
you
run
what
part
you
play
when
you
would
tempt
from
his
calling
one
who
if
you
leave
god
to
work
his
own
pleasure
shall
hereafter
shine
as
the
stars
through
all
eternity
she
did
not
answer
back
with
pride
instead
her
whole
face
grew
soft
and
the
large
tears
filled
her
eyes
and
ran
slowly
down
her
cheeks
want
to
do
right
she
said
humbly
i
can
not
feel
that
it
is
right
father
see
i
will
not
ask
you
to
make
my
intention
yours
but
i
promise
you
one
thing
i
ask
god
to
grant
me
this
blessing
but
it
shall
be
the
last
time
if
i
fail
now
let
his
will
be
done
and
do
you
father
ask
him
to
make
it
plain
to
me
what
his
will
bless
you
daughter
the
old
priest
answered
much
moved
by
her
humility
will
pray
that
indeed
but
still
i
warn
you
that
i
think
you
are
doing
wrong
in
so
much
as
trying
such
an
experiment
as
this
which
you
have
no
she
cried
again
no
father
this
once
i
must
try
or
my
heart
will
again
in
the
carriage
she
pressed
elizabeth
to
her
closely
and
kissed
her
and
said
words
of
passionate
love
finding
relief
thus
for
the
feelings
of
her
heart
but
elizabeth
knew
not
how
to
reply
it
troubled
and
perplexed
her
this
lavish
affection
for
she
could
not
repay
it
in
kind
it
only
served
to
waken
a
suffering
which
she
had
known
from
childhood
a
strange
unsatisfied
yearning
within
her
which
came
at
the
sight
of
a
lovely
landscape
or
the
sound
of
exquisite
music
or
the
caresses
of
some
friend
she
wanted
and
where
and
what
was
that
which
seemed
to
lie
beyond
everything
and
which
she
could
never
grasp
she
felt
it
often
during
her
visit
that
visit
where
attention
was
constantly
bestowed
on
her
and
she
lived
in
the
midst
of
such
luxury
as
she
had
never
known
before
something
in
face
seemed
to
her
to
promise
an
answer
to
her
questionings
it
was
so
at
rest
so
settled
and
this
more
than
anything
else
about
him
interested
and
attracted
her
madame
saw
the
interest
without
guessing
the
cause
she
felt
also
that
heinrich
was
not
wholly
insensible
to
presence
and
though
she
asked
him
no
direct
questions
she
contrived
to
turn
conversation
into
the
channels
which
could
not
fail
to
engage
him
and
which
the
young
convert
also
cared
for
most
elizabeth
decided
that
heinrich
knew
more
than
any
one
else
but
even
he
tired
her
sometimes
knows
much
she
thought
he
is
so
cold
and
indifferent
yet
he
would
not
be
himself
if
he
were
more
like
madame
and
she
is
too
tender
oh
what
does
it
all
mean
there
is
nothing
that
makes
one
content
except
church
and
one
can
not
be
always
so
passed
the
time
till
eve
that
night
when
the
young
people
entered
the
madame
was
absent
she
sent
a
message
that
they
must
dine
without
her
as
she
had
a
severe
headache
and
elizabeth
might
come
to
her
an
hour
after
dinner
the
meal
was
a
silent
one
when
it
was
over
and
they
went
into
the
library
heinrich
seated
himself
at
the
organ
grand
chorals
funeral
marches
full
of
mourning
and
awe
and
hope
mass
music
welcoming
the
coming
of
the
lord
of
sabaoth
filled
the
lofty
room
when
he
ceased
elizabeth
was
sobbing
irrepressibly
me
forgive
me
she
said
can
not
help
it
o
monsieur
i
know
not
what
it
means
love
and
hate
beauty
and
deformity
joy
and
suffering
i
can
not
understand
nothing
satisfies
and
to
be
a
catholic
makes
the
craving
worse
is
it
because
i
am
only
just
beginning
and
that
i
shall
understand
better
by
and
by
he
stood
at
a
little
distance
from
her
looking
not
at
her
at
all
but
upward
and
far
away
will
tell
mademoiselle
a
story
if
she
will
permit
it
he
said
years
ago
there
was
a
princess
very
beautiful
very
wise
and
very
wealthy
her
councillors
begged
that
she
would
marry
and
at
last
she
told
them
that
she
would
do
so
if
they
would
find
for
her
the
prince
she
should
describe
he
should
be
so
rich
that
he
should
esteem
all
the
treasures
of
the
indies
as
a
little
dust
so
wise
that
no
man
could
ever
mention
in
his
presence
aught
that
he
did
not
already
know
so
fair
that
no
child
of
man
should
compare
with
him
in
beauty
so
spotless
in
his
soul
that
the
very
heavens
should
not
be
pure
in
his
sight
they
knew
not
where
to
find
that
prince
but
their
lady
he
paused
though
not
as
for
an
answer
he
had
guessed
well
his
plans
and
hopes
he
fathomed
as
truly
nature
and
when
he
spoke
again
it
was
as
no
one
except
the
priest
of
god
had
ever
heard
him
speak
are
some
souls
whom
no
one
and
nothing
on
earth
can
possibly
satisfy
beauty
and
learning
and
friendship
and
home
and
love
each
alike
wearies
them
god
only
can
content
them
and
he
is
enough
to
such
souls
he
gives
himself
if
they
sincerely
desire
it
it
is
a
love
beyond
all
imaginable
earthly
love
it
satisfies
yet
leaves
a
constant
craving
which
we
have
no
wish
should
cease
he
understands
everything
even
those
things
which
we
can
not
explain
to
ourselves
it
is
he
finding
whom
the
soul
loveth
him
and
will
not
let
him
after
saying
this
he
sat
down
once
more
at
the
organ
and
played
again
till
the
hour
named
by
madame
arrived
elizabeth
found
her
pale
and
suffering
but
with
a
glad
look
in
her
eyes
have
had
talk
together
then
she
cried
heard
the
music
cease
for
a
while
and
is
he
not
charming
and
good
my
heinrich
elizabeth
said
dreamily
made
me
understand
a
little
better
than
any
one
has
ever
done
that
so
my
little
one
and
how
then
elizabeth
said
innocently
laying
her
hand
on
her
heart
and
with
no
suspicion
of
the
meaning
which
the
countess
attached
to
the
act
i
could
only
understand
more
will
in
time
most
dear
one
in
time
in
and
oh
the
exulting
ring
in
voice
see
my
precious
what
i
have
to
show
a
chest
was
drawn
up
beside
she
opened
it
and
before
dazzled
eyes
lay
jewels
of
wondrous
lustre
and
value
long
strings
of
pearls
changing
opals
with
the
trembling
in
them
sapphires
blue
as
the
sky
emeralds
green
as
the
sea
and
glittering
diamonds
madame
drew
out
the
costly
things
and
adorned
elizabeth
with
one
set
after
another
by
turn
watching
the
effect
last
of
all
she
touched
a
spring
and
took
from
a
secret
drawer
a
set
of
pearls
large
and
round
with
a
soft
amber
tint
in
them
these
she
held
caressingly
and
sighed
elizabeth
she
said
years
ago
this
very
night
i
wore
them
when
i
was
a
girl
like
you
there
was
a
great
ball
here
some
one
ah
but
how
grand
and
beautiful
he
looked
my
poor
heart
remembers
well
and
is
sore
with
the
memory
now
some
one
begged
me
to
try
the
charm
of
eve
dost
know
it
dear
nay
then
you
shall
try
it
too
go
supperless
to
rest
look
not
to
left
or
right
nor
yet
behind
you
but
pray
god
to
show
you
that
which
shall
satisfy
your
heart
of
he
show
you
madame
madame
sighed
heavily
love
alas
what
contents
us
here
i
had
it
for
a
time
and
then
god
took
it
from
me
no
prouder
wife
than
i
no
prouder
mother
but
husband
and
sons
are
gone
all
except
my
heinrich
pray
god
to
keep
him
for
me
elizabeth
who
then
was
agnes
madame
and
shall
i
pray
to
her
that
prayer
madame
looked
aghast
then
smiled
an
amused
yet
troubled
smile
child
i
thought
not
of
that
agnes
was
one
who
loved
our
blessed
lord
alone
not
man
she
died
rather
than
yield
to
earthly
love
and
why
madame
child
child
but
i
forget
you
have
only
just
begun
the
catholic
life
my
sweet
love
then
is
enough
for
some
people
but
they
are
monks
and
nuns
not
common
christians
like
you
and
me
and
heinrich
we
could
not
live
in
that
way
could
we
elizabeth
you
and
heinrich
and
i
god
would
never
grow
tired
of
us
madame
nor
ever
die
nor
ever
misunderstand
o
madame
i
think
we
could
not
live
with
and
elizabeth
stood
up
suddenly
as
if
too
agitated
to
remain
quiet
love
you
are
only
just
a
convert
in
first
excitement
one
fancies
many
things
you
are
meant
to
serve
god
in
the
world
my
dear
for
many
years
to
come
you
and
my
heinrich
pray
for
him
but
hurrying
along
the
hall
to
her
own
room
elizabeth
whispered
passionately
in
her
heart
do
not
want
to
pray
for
him
let
him
pray
for
himself
his
saints
pray
for
him
too
and
god
loves
him
and
he
does
not
need
me
does
madame
then
suppose
that
he
could
ever
care
for
me
or
i
for
him
i
want
more
than
he
can
give
more
more
me
my
desire
o
god
my
god
in
her
excitement
and
in
the
darkness
she
laid
her
hand
on
the
wrong
door
and
opening
it
found
herself
in
an
old
gallery
at
the
end
of
which
a
light
was
glimmering
scarcely
heeding
what
she
did
she
moved
toward
it
and
found
that
she
was
in
the
choir
of
the
castle
chapel
the
door
fell
gently
to
behind
her
but
did
not
close
and
elizabeth
was
alone
alone
the
aisles
were
empty
the
organ
was
still
the
priest
was
gone
but
before
the
sacred
shrine
the
steady
ray
of
the
lamp
told
that
he
who
filleth
the
heaven
of
heavens
was
dwelling
in
his
earthly
temple
and
that
unseen
angels
guarded
all
the
place
but
of
angels
or
men
elizabeth
thought
not
silently
slowly
she
moved
onward
her
hands
pressed
upon
her
heart
whose
passionate
beating
grew
still
as
she
came
nearer
to
the
sacred
heart
which
alone
could
fully
comfort
fully
strengthen
fully
understand
slowly
she
moved
as
one
who
knows
that
some
great
joy
is
coming
surely
and
who
lengthens
willingly
the
bliss
of
expectation
and
so
she
reached
a
narrow
flight
of
steps
and
made
her
way
gently
down
and
knelt
outside
in
the
clear
night
a
great
wind
rose
and
rocked
the
but
elizabeth
knew
it
not
she
was
conscious
only
of
the
intense
stillness
of
that
unseen
presence
of
peace
flooding
her
whole
soul
like
a
river
of
the
nearness
of
one
who
is
strength
and
love
and
truth
infinite
and
eternal
me
my
desire
o
god
my
god
she
sighed
god
god
she
lifted
up
her
eyes
and
there
above
the
shrine
beheld
the
great
crucifix
of
hohenstein
brought
from
the
east
by
a
crusader
knight
she
lifted
up
her
eyes
and
saw
the
haggard
face
full
of
unceasing
prayer
the
sunken
cheeks
the
pierced
hands
and
feet
the
bones
easy
to
number
in
the
worn
and
tortured
body
the
side
with
its
deep
wound
where
a
spear
had
passed
yet
looking
upward
steadily
all
her
excitement
gone
a
sacred
calm
upon
her
inmost
soul
elizabeth
knew
that
her
prayer
was
answered
her
lifelong
hunger
satisfied
god
had
given
her
her
desire
god
god
no
love
but
his
could
satisfy
and
his
could
with
an
eternal
content
to
that
heart
pierced
for
her
broken
for
her
she
could
offer
no
less
than
her
whole
heart
and
that
she
offer
not
by
constraint
but
simply
because
she
loved
him
beyond
all
above
all
and
knew
that
in
him
and
in
him
only
she
was
sure
of
an
unfailing
an
everlasting
love
madame
seeking
her
in
the
early
morning
found
her
room
unoccupied
then
noticed
the
ajar
and
trembling
sought
her
there
elizabeth
had
kept
eve
indeed
but
it
was
before
the
shrine
of
spouse
and
lord
daughter
the
countess
said
using
the
word
for
the
first
time
and
with
oh
how
sad
a
tone
have
you
done
this
night
my
daughter
elizabeth
lifted
hand
and
face
toward
the
shrine
she
answered
slowly
as
one
who
speaks
unconsciously
in
sleep
have
found
him
whom
my
soul
loveth
i
hold
him
and
i
will
not
let
him
god
himself
had
made
his
way
plain
indeed
before
madame
the
countess
of
hohenstein
in
this
her
last
struggle
with
his
will
the
very
plan
which
she
had
chosen
to
gain
her
cherished
hopes
had
crushed
them
not
priest
or
son
but
the
girl
whom
she
herself
had
named
for
her
final
trial
had
shown
her
that
purposes
were
far
aside
from
hers
all
o
lord
she
cried
while
her
tears
fell
like
rain
all
i
have
i
dare
not
struggle
one
son
gave
up
his
life
a
martyr
in
the
church
in
japan
another
endured
a
lifelong
martyrdom
among
the
lepers
of
the
levant
winning
souls
yet
more
tainted
than
the
bodies
home
again
to
god
and
one
the
youngest
and
the
fairest
and
the
dearest
was
seen
in
china
and
in
india
in
peru
and
in
mexico
going
without
question
wherever
he
was
sent
for
the
greater
glory
of
god
but
he
was
never
seen
in
his
german
home
again
after
they
once
left
her
their
mother
never
beheld
their
faces
and
she
who
had
been
taken
to
her
heart
as
a
daughter
entered
an
order
in
a
distant
land
yet
none
ever
heard
madame
the
last
countess
of
hohenstein
murmur
against
her
lot
clearly
tenderly
patiently
more
and
more
did
god
vouchsafe
to
make
his
way
plain
to
her
in
chapel
day
by
day
she
watched
the
decaying
banners
which
told
of
the
fields
her
fathers
won
saw
the
monuments
to
men
of
her
race
who
had
fought
and
died
for
their
king
and
their
land
read
the
names
once
proudly
vaunted
now
almost
forgotten
what
was
fame
like
this
to
the
honor
god
had
showered
on
her
souls
east
and
west
brought
safe
to
him
life
laid
down
for
the
lord
of
lords
a
seed
not
to
be
reckoned
a
lineage
which
could
never
fail
sons
and
daughters
to
stand
at
last
in
that
multitude
which
no
one
can
number
who
have
come
out
of
great
tribulation
with
fadeless
palms
of
victory
in
their
hands
such
was
her
place
and
name
in
the
house
of
god
the
quaint
german
text
upon
her
tombstone
puzzled
travellers
greatly
and
those
who
could
decipher
it
wondered
but
the
more
it
ran
thus
in
gertrude
and
last
countess
of
the
children
of
thy
barrenness
shall
still
say
in
thy
ears
the
place
is
too
strait
for
me
make
me
room
to
dwell
in
and
thou
shalt
say
in
thy
heart
who
hath
begotten
me
these
i
was
barren
and
brought
not
forth
led
away
and
captive
and
who
hath
brought
up
these
i
was
destitute
and
alone
and
these
where
were
they
thus
saith
the
lord
god
behold
i
will
lift
up
my
hand
to
the
gentiles
and
will
set
up
my
standard
to
the
people
and
they
shall
bring
thy
sons
in
their
arms
and
carry
thy
daughters
upon
their
shoulders
and
thou
shalt
know
that
i
am
the
lord
for
they
shall
not
be
confounded
that
wait
for
him
the
basques
we
are
all
basques
nay
reader
be
not
startled
at
having
your
supposed
nationality
thus
suddenly
set
aside
an
author
of
far
more
learning
than
we
can
lay
claim
to
señor
erro
a
spanish
basque
gravely
asserts
that
all
the
inhabitants
of
europe
and
asia
if
not
of
america
also
sprang
from
the
basques
in
short
they
that
is
are
the
primitive
race
and
this
fearless
writer
with
a
due
sense
of
national
superiority
goes
boldly
on
to
prove
that
adam
and
eve
spoke
the
basque
language
in
the
terrestrial
paradise
of
which
he
gives
a
detailed
description
according
to
the
biscayan
interpretation
of
the
biblical
account
we
remember
how
in
search
of
adam
great
progenitor
whose
statue
is
among
the
army
of
saints
on
the
glorious
roof
of
milan
cathedral
we
got
bewildered
on
that
celestial
height
so
that
we
do
not
to
this
day
feel
sure
of
having
discovered
the
true
adam
and
might
never
have
found
our
way
down
to
earth
again
had
it
not
been
for
the
kind
offices
of
one
of
victor
soldiers
so
it
is
with
many
a
in
tracing
the
origin
of
the
human
species
lost
in
threading
the
way
back
to
our
first
parents
they
need
some
rough
uncultured
soul
to
lead
them
out
of
the
bewildering
maze
back
to
the
point
whence
they
started
but
let
us
hope
in
this
instance
filial
instinct
has
not
mistaken
the
genuine
adam
the
first
speaker
it
is
possible
of
basque
señor
erro
finds
in
this
language
the
origin
of
all
civilization
and
science
it
must
be
confessed
we
have
wofully
forgotten
our
for
it
is
said
to
be
impossible
to
learn
to
speak
it
unless
one
goes
very
young
among
the
basques
it
is
a
common
saying
of
theirs
that
the
devil
once
came
into
their
country
to
learn
the
language
but
gave
it
up
in
despair
after
three
hundred
application
it
may
be
inferred
he
had
lost
the
knowledge
he
had
made
such
successful
use
of
a
few
thousand
years
before
in
the
garden
of
eden
astarloa
likewise
a
biscayan
maintains
that
the
extraordinary
perfection
of
this
language
is
a
proof
it
is
the
only
one
that
could
have
been
conferred
on
the
first
man
by
his
creator
but
in
another
place
says
it
was
formed
by
god
himself
at
the
confusion
of
tongues
in
the
tower
of
babel
which
assertions
rather
lack
harmony
max
müller
the
eminent
philologist
pretends
a
serious
discussion
took
place
about
two
hundred
years
ago
in
the
metropolitan
chapter
of
pampeluna
as
to
the
following
knotty
points
was
basque
the
primitive
language
of
mankind
the
learned
members
confessed
that
however
strong
might
be
their
private
convictions
they
did
not
dare
give
an
affirmative
reply
was
basque
the
only
language
spoken
by
adam
and
eve
in
the
garden
of
eden
as
to
this
the
whole
chapter
declared
there
could
be
no
doubt
whatever
that
it
was
to
bring
a
reasonable
objection
against
such
an
this
is
extremely
amusing
but
of
course
too
absurd
to
be
true
besides
the
archives
of
pampeluna
do
not
afford
the
slightest
hint
of
so
singular
a
record
southwestern
france
however
has
many
traditions
of
the
oriental
origin
of
its
inhabitants
tarbes
and
lourdes
are
said
to
have
been
founded
by
abyssinian
princesses
belleforest
in
his
says
japhet
himself
came
into
gaul
and
built
the
city
of
périgueux
which
for
several
ages
bore
his
name
père
bajole
of
condom
a
jesuit
of
the
xviith
century
is
less
precise
in
his
suppositions
but
thinks
the
country
was
peopled
soon
after
the
deluge
and
therefore
by
those
who
had
correct
notions
of
the
true
god
moreover
as
noah
of
course
would
not
have
allowed
his
descendants
to
depart
without
suitable
advice
as
to
the
way
of
salvation
especially
to
the
head
of
the
colony
he
concludes
that
many
of
the
ancient
aquitanians
were
saved
the
sire
dupleix
cites
the
epistle
of
martial
to
show
they
had
retained
some
proper
notions
of
theology
which
accounts
for
the
rapid
success
of
the
first
christian
apostles
of
the
country
but
to
return
to
the
basques
in
particular
in
the
an
old
book
of
the
xith
century
we
read
that
first
settlement
in
spain
was
made
by
the
patriarch
tubal
whose
people
spoke
the
language
still
used
in
the
provinces
of
that
is
the
basque
william
von
humboldt
likewise
attributed
to
the
basques
an
asiatic
origin
and
was
decidedly
of
the
school
of
mm
erro
and
astarloa
though
he
rejected
their
exaggerations
the
basque
language
so
rich
harmonious
and
expressive
is
now
generally
believed
to
be
one
of
the
turanian
tongues
prince
lucian
bonaparte
shows
the
analogy
between
it
and
the
hungarian
georgian
etc
the
word
basque
is
derived
from
the
latin
for
in
southwestern
france
it
is
quite
common
to
pronounce
the
letter
like
a
habit
which
made
scaliger
wittily
say
populi
quibus
vivere

the

consists
of
several
provinces

the

ancient

there
is
a
difference

mountains
they
long
kept
the
romans
at
bay
drove
back
the
moors
and
crushed
the

charlemagne
the
basques
have
always
been
famous
navigators
the
first
suggestion
that
led
to
the
discovery
of
america
is
said
to
have
been
given
christopher
columbus
by
sanchez
de
huelva
a
basque
pilot
the
basques
of
labourd
certainly
discovered
cape
breton
they
were
the
first
to
go
on
which
in
extended
as
far
as
iceland
and
newfoundland
seems
to
have
been
known
to
them
in
the
middle
of
the
xvth
century
the
first
name
of
cape
breton
isle
des
bacaloas
or
bacaloac
is
a
basque
name
in
the
middle
ages
the
basques
maintained
a
certain
independence
by
means
of
their
or
special
privileges
which
had
been
handed
down
from
time
immemorial
and
confirmed
by
several
of
the
kings
of
france
the
wood
of
haïtze
is
still
pointed
out
as
the
place
where
the
assemblies
of
the
elders
or
were
formerly
held
in
the
district
of
labourd
here
came
together
the
proprietors
of
the
different
communes
to
regulate
their
administrative
affairs
the
most
of
the
assembly
leaned
on
their
staves
or
against
the
venerable
oaks
of
the
forest
but
the
presiding
member
sat
on
a
huge
stone
the
secretary
on
another
while
a
third
was
used
for
recording
the
decrees
of
the
assembly
to
which
the
kings
of
france
and
navarre
were
often
forced
to
yield
by
virtue
of
their
and
this
country
was
never
by
oppressive
lords
who
held
it
in
subjection
by
means
of
their
fortified
castles
the
device
of
bayonne
seems
to
express
the
unstained
independence
that
had
never
been
subjected
to
feudal
dominion
it
doubtless
had
great
families
who
distinguished
themselves
by
their
bravery
and
military
services
and
were
noted
for
their
wealth
like
the
de
parientes
the
families
of
great
antiquity
in
guypuzcoa
among
which
was
the
family
of
loyola
of
aspeïtia
to
which
the
immortal
founder
of
the
jesuits
belonged
as
well
as
that
of
balda
his
family
but
they
never
pretended
to
the
feudal
authority
of
the
great
nobles
of
france
and
spain
it
was
only
in
the
xvth
century
that
several
basque
families
who
had
become
wealthy
ventured
to
erect
some
inoffensive
towers
like
those
of
uturbi
near
jean
de
luz
occupied
by
louis
xi
while
on
the
frontier
arranging
the
treaty
between
the
kings
of
castile
and
arragon
it
is
said
of
the
basques
of
spain
as
many
basques
as
many
nobles
many
of
their
villages
have
coats
of
arms
on
all
the
houses
which
contrast
with
the
decayed
lattices
and
crumbling
roofs
the
owners
point
to
their
emblazonry
with
the
air
of
a
montmorency
when
the
moors
invaded
the
north
of
spain
thousands
of
mountaineers
rose
to
drive
them
out
as
they
made
war
at
their
own
expense
those
who
returned
alive
to
their
cottages
received
the
reward
of
gentlemen
the
right
of
assuming
some
heraldic
sign
and
graving
it
on
their
walls
as
a
perpetual
memorial
of
their
deeds
in
the
valley
of
roncal
the
inhabitants
were
all
ennobled
for
having
distinguished
themselves

of

is
still
to
be

with
double
lancet

has
its

had
taken
at
the

azure

traversed
by
a

the
emperor
created
him
knight
and
gave
him
for
his
arms
the
imperial
eagle
but
most
of
these
armorial
bearings
have
reference
to
the
chase
to
which
the
people
were
so
addicted
the
trophies
they
brought
home
instead
of
being
nailed
up
over

in

is
a
château
which
bears
the
name
of
salla
from
the
founder
of
the
family
it
was
he
who
fighting
under
alphonse
the
chaste
king
of
navarre
had
his
legs
broken
by
the
explosion
of
a
rock
from
which
time
the
house
of
salla
has
had
for
its
arms
three
brisés

the
most
illustrious
member
of
this

is
jean

founded
the
admirable

with
a
special
mission
for
instructing
the

origin
the
château

is
still
to
be
seen
an
old
with
gothic
turrets
bespeaking
the
antiquity
of
the
family
the
name
is
associated
with
the
legends
of
the
country
tradition
relates
that
a
winged
monster
having
terrified
the
whole
region
a
knight
of
this
house
armed
himself
with
a
lance
and
went
forth
to
attack
the
monster
in
his
den
the
dragon
having
received
a
mortal
wound
sprang
with
a
dying
effort
upon
his
enemy
seized
him
and
rolled
with
him
into

from
that
time
the

bore
on

shield
a
dragon

a

bearing
a

and
a
comb
symbol
of
this
enchanting
region
this
historic
place
once
the
rival
of
jean
de
luz
now
wears
a
touching
aspect
of
desolation
and
mourning
which
only
adds
to
its
attractions
its
ruins
have
a
hue
of
antiquity
that
must
delight
a
eye
the
long
street
that
leads
to
the
principal
square
carries
one
back
three
hundred
years
most
of
the
houses
being
in
the
spanish
style
of
the
xvith
century
there
are
coats
of
arms
over
every
door
and
balconies
projecting
from
every
story
with
complicated
trellises
or
lattices
that
must
almost
madden
the
serenader
nothing
could
be
more
picturesque
than
this
truly
spanish
place
many
of
the
houses
bear
the
imposing
name
of
which
testify
to
the
ancient
splendor
of
this
muy
noble
muy
leal
y
muy
overlooking
the
whole
place
is
the
château
of
jeanne
la
folle
massive
heavy
its
walls
three
yards
thick
its
towers
round
a
genuine
fortress
founded
in
the
xth
century
but
mostly
rebuilt
by
charles
its
chronicles
are
full
of
historic
interest
here
took
place
the
interview
between
louis
xi
and
henri
iv
of
castille
whose
arrogant
favorite
beltram
de
la
cueva
in
his
mantle
broidered
with
gold
and
pearls
and
diamonds
and
his
boat
with
its
awning
of
cloth
of
gold
must
have
offered
a
striking
contrast
to
the
extreme
simplicity
of
the
king
of
france
the
fine
imposing
church
of
fontarabia
in
the
transition
style
is
a
marked
exception
to
the
basque
churches
generally
which
are
of
simple
primitive
architecture
with
but
few
ornaments
and
these
at
least
on
the
french
side
of
the
frontier
mostly
confined
to
the
sanctuary
which
is
rich
in
color
and
gilding
perhaps
over
the
main
altar
is
a
painting
but
by
no
means
by
murillo
or
velasquez
if
on
the
spanish
side
it
may
be
a
iago
on
a
white
steed
sword
in
hand
with
a
red
mantle
over
his
dress
looking
like
a
genuine
breathing
destruction
against
the
moors
the
madonna
too
is
always
there
perhaps
with
a
wheel
of
silver
swords
as
if
in
her
bosom
were
centred
all
the
sorrows
of
the
human
race
the
galleries
around
the
nave
in
the
basque
churches
gives
them
the
appearance
of
a
de
but
the
clergy
think
the
separation
of
the
sexes
promotes
the
respect
due
in
the
sanctuary
and
the
people
themselves
cling
to
the
practice
the
men
occupy
the
galleries
they
all
have
rosaries
in
their
hands
from
time
to
time
you
can
see
them
kiss
their
thumbs
placed
in
the
form
of
a
cross
perhaps
to
set
a
seal
on
their
vows
to
god
as
people
in
the
middle
ages
used
to
seal
their
letters
with
their
thumbs
to
give
them
a
sacred
inviolability
licking
the
thumb
was
we
know
an
ancient
form
of
giving
a
solemn
pledge
and
till
a
recent
period
the
legal
form
of
completing
a
bargain
in
scotland
was
to
join
the
thumbs
and
lick
them
say
ye
man
my
thumb
beguile
ye
said
rob
roy
to
bailie
nicol
jarvie
when
mass
is
over
every
man
in
the
galleries
respectfully
salutes
his
next
neighbor
this
is
considered
obligatory
were
it
even
his
deadliest
enemy
he
must
bow
his
head
before
him
mass
heard
with
devotion
brings
the
truce
of
god
to
the
heart
the
women
occupy
the
nave
sitting
or
kneeling
on
the
black
carpet
that
covers
the
stone
above
the
tomb
of
their
beloved
dead
for
every
family
has
a
slab
of
wood
or
marble
with
an
inscription
in
large
characters
which
covers
the
family
vault
below
and
their
notions
of
pious
respect
oblige
the
living
to
kneel
on
the
stone
that
covers
the
bones
of
their
forefathers
or
this
the
case
for
of
late
years
burial
in
churches
has
been
forbidden
and
these
slabs
now
only
serve
to
designate
the
inalienable
right
of
the
families
to
occupy
them
during
the
divine
service
it
is
curious
and
interesting
to
examine
these
sepulchral
slabs
for
they
are
like
the
archives
of
a
town
inscribed
with
the
names
of
the
principal
inhabitants
with
their
rank
and
occupation
in
some
places
the
women
by
turns
bring
every
morning
an
offering
for
their
pastor
which
they
deposit
on
these
stones
like
an
expiatory
libation
several
of
them
are
daily
garnished
with
fruit
wine
eggs
beeswax
yarn
and
linen
thread
and
the
accompanied
by
his
servant
or
the
sacristan
goes
around
after
mass
to
collect
this
tribute
of
rural
piety
in
a
basket
and
give
his
blessing
to
the
families
these
offerings
of
the
of
the
earth
are
still
continued
though
the
dead
are
buried
elsewhere
the
seat
of
that
mighty
potentate
the
village
mayor
is
in
the
choir
as
befits
his
dignity
which
he
fully
sustains
by
his
majestic
deportment
in
sight
of
the
whole
congregation
sometimes
he
chants
at
the
lectern
like
charlemagne
the
square
peristyle
of
the
church
is
often
divided
between
him
and
the
village
for
their
respective
functions
as
if
to
invest
them
with
a
kind
of
sanctity
in
soule
the
belfry
is
formed
by
extending
upwards
the
western
wall
of
the
church
in
the
form
of
three
gables
looking
like
three
obelisks
the
bell
is
hung
in
the
central
one
the
origin
of
this
custom
is
thus
explained
by
cénac
montaut
former
times
when
the
basques
had
some
difficulty
about
accepting
all
the
truths
of
the
gospel
the
clergy
were
unable
to
make
them
comprehend
the
doctrine
of
the
holy
trinity
one
of
the
priests
like
patrick
with
the
shamrock
saw
he
must
appeal
to
the
senses
in
order
to
reach
the
mind
and
heart
entering
his
rude
pulpit
one
day
he
addressed
his
flock
something
after
the
following
manner
of
you
my
dear
brethren
recently
objected
that
the
god
of
the
old
testament
in
the
tables
of
the
law
wished
to
be
worshipped
as
one
god
and
that
to
add
now
the
son
and
holy
spirit
to
the
deity
is
to
overthrow
the
law
of
sinai
and
affect
the
divine
essence
my
dear
brethren
hitherto
we
have
had
but
one
gable
on
our
belfry
directing
towards
heaven
the
innermost
prayer
of
the
heart
and
bearing
the
bell
by
which
god
seems
to
speak
to
us
in
return
if
now
two
other
gables
were
added
to
this
would
not
this
triple
tower
standing
on
one
base
and
pointing
to
the
same
heaven
still
constitute
one
belfry
this
appeal
was
effective
those
who
had
been
unable
to
accept
the
abstract
doctrine
of
the
trinity
perfectly
comprehended
this
material
unity
the
other
priests
of
soule
hastened
to
make
use
of
so
happy
an
oratorical
figure
and
all
through
the
valley
of
the
gave
rose
the
dogmatic
belfries
such
as
we
see
at
the
present
day
near
the
church
is
often
a
modest
white
house
with
a
small
garden
containing
a
few
trees
and
flowers
where
the
daughters
of
the
cross
devote
themselves
to
the
instruction
of
children
planting
the
seeds
of
piety
in
their
youthful
hearts
the
basque
houses
with
their
triangular
roofs
often
project
like
a
and
are
painted
white
green
and
even
pink
the
casements
are
made
in
the
form
of
a
cross
and
stained
red
the
doorway
is
arched
like
a
and
has
over
it
a
virgin
or
crucifix
or
some
pious
inscription
there
is
no
bolt
on
the
door
for
a
basque
roof
is
too
inviolable
to
need
a
fastening
at
the
entrance
is
a
for
holy
water
as
if
the
house
were
to
the
owner
a
kind
of
sanctuary
to
be
entered
with
purification
and
a
holy
thought
you
enter
a
large
hall
that
divides
the
house
into
two
parts
and
contains
all
the
farming
utensils
it
is
here
the
husbandman
husks
his
corn
and
thrashes
his
wheat
the
uncolored
walls
of
the
rooms
are
hung
with
a
few
rude
pictures
as
of
the
last
judgment
the
wandering
jew
or
napoleon
there
are
some
large
presses
a
few
wooden
chairs
a
shelf
in
the
corner
with
a
covering
for
the
statue
of
the
virgin
who
wears
a
crown
of
on
her
head
and
a
rosary
around
her
neck
at
one
end
of
the
room
is
a
bed
large
enough
for
a
whole
family
and
so
high
as
almost
to
need
a
ladder
to
ascend
it
the
open
pink
curtains
show
the
font
the
crucifix
and
faded
palm
branch
annually
renewed
there
is
no
house
without
some
religious
symbol
the
basque
has
great
faith
in
prayer
he
stops
his
plough
or
wild
native
dance
to
say
the
angelus
he
never
forgets
to
arm
himself
with
the
sign
of
the
cross
in
a
moment
of
danger
he
makes
it
over
the
loaf
of
bread
before
he
divides
it
among
the
family
the
mother
makes
it
on
the
foreheads
of
her
children
at
night
at
candlemas
a
blessed
candle
burns
under
every
roof
in
honor
of
the
true
light
which
lighteth
every
man
that
cometh
into
the
world
it
is
the
boast
of
the
country
that
protestantism
never
found
entrance
therein
even
during
its
prevalence
in
béarn
at
the
time
of
joan
of
navarre
though
that
princess
took
pains
to
have
the
huguenot
version
of
the
new
testament
translated
into
basque
and
published
at
la
rochelle
in
for
their
benefit
the
whole
bible
is
now
translated
duvoisin
having
devoted
six
years
to
the
work
and
prince
lucian
bonaparte
a
still
longer
time
in
settling
the
orthography
and
superintending
the
edition
it
must
not
be
supposed
however
that
the
basques
are
an
austere
race
they
are
very
fond
of
their
national
dances
and
excel
in
the
de

their
other
amusements

with
a

is
borrowed
from
the

the
legend
of
roland
the

with
the
moors
etc
they
are
composed
by
native
poets
and
have
a
certain
antique
simplicity
not
without
its
charm
the
people
flock
to
these
representations
as
to
their
cantabrian
dances

their
gayest
attire
the

of

of

no
one
goes
to
the
basque
country
without
visiting
the
famous
pas
de
roland
the
whole
region
is
singularly
wild
and
picturesque
we
pass
through
a
deep
gorge
encumbered
with
rocks
over
which
the
nive
plunges
and
foams
in
the
maddest
possible
way
twin
mountains
of
granite
rise
to
the
very
heavens
their
sides
covered
with
the
golden
broom
or
furrowed
with
deep
gullies
that
tell
of
mountain
torrents
the
overhanging
cliffs
and
the
dizzy
winding
road
along
the
edge
of
the
abyss
create
a
feeling
of
awe
and
by
the
time
we
arrive
breathless
and
fatigued
at
the
pas
de
roland
we
are
quite
prepared
to
believe
anything
marvellous
lie
reclined
against
some
trunk
the
husbandman
has
felled
old
legendary
poems
fill
my
mind
and
parables
of
eld
i
wander
with
orlando
through
the
wood
or
muse
with
jaques
in
his
this
archway
was
produced
by
a
mere
blow
from
the
heel
of
the
great
paladin
who
did
not
consider
the
mountain
worthy
the
use
of
his
mighty
sword
everything
is
bathed
in
the
golden
light
of
the
wondrous
legend
which
harmonizes
with
the
spot
we
even
fancy
we
can
hear
the
powerful
horn
of
orlando
the
greatest
trumpeter
on
record
we
can
see
carloman
with
his
black
plumes
and
red
mantle
as
he
is
described
in
the
the
natives
do
not
call
this
pass
by
the
name
of
roland
but
a
bad
dangerous
passage
as
in
truth
it
is
it
is
the
only
means
of
communication
with
the
opposite
side
of
the
mountain
after
going
through
it
the
mountains
recede
the
horizon
expands
a
country
full
of
bucolic
delights
is
revealed
to
the
eye
the
exaltation
of
the
soul
subsides
and
the
mind
settles
down
to
its
normal
state
of
incredulity
just
below
the
pas
de
roland
on
the
french
side
are
the
thermal
springs
of
cambo
in
a
lovely
little
valley
watered
by
the
nive
the
air
here
is
pure
the
climate
mild
the
meadows
fresh
and
sprinkled
with
flowers
the
encircling
hills
are
crowned
with
verdure
never
did
nature
put
on
an
aspect
of
more
grace
and
beauty
than
in
this
delicious
spot
one
of
the
springs
is
sulphurous
the
other
ferruginous
they
became
popular
among
the
spanish
and
basques
during
the
last
century
when
patronized
by
queen
marie
anne
de
neuberg
the
second
wife
of
don
carlos
ii
of
spain
some
of
her
royal
gifts
to
the
church
of
cambo
are
still
shown
with
pride
these
springs
were
visited
as
early
as
among
others
by
françois
de
nouailles
bishop
of
dax
who
is
often
referred
to
in
proof
of
their
efficacy
but
as
that
eminent
diplomatist
died
a
few
weeks
after
he
tried
the
waters
the
less
said
of
his
cure
the
better
for
their
reputation
napoleon
however
had
faith
in
their
virtues
he
visited
cambo
and
was
only
prevented
by
his
downfall
from
building
a
military
hospital
here
not
two
miles
from
cambo
is
the
busy
town
of
hasparren
the
way
thither
is
through
a
delightful
country
with
some
fresh
beauty
bursting
on
the
eye
at
every
step
on
all
sides
are
to
be
seen
the
neat
white
cottages
of
the
laborers
in
the
midst
of
orchards
meadows
and
vineyards
sometimes
in
the
hollows
of
a
valley
like
a
nest
among
the
green
leaves
sometimes
on
the
hills
commanding
the
most
delicious
of
landscapes
hasparren
has
about
six
thousand
inhabitants
mostly
farmers
but
who
try
to
increase
their
income
by
some
trade
twelve
hundred
of
them
are
shoemakers
seven
or
eight
hundred
are
weavers
curriers
or
the
spacious
church
is
hardly
able
to
contain
the
crowd
of
worshippers
on
festivals
a
curious
history
is
connected
with
the
belfry
the
government
having
imposed
a
tax
on
salt
in
the
people
around
hasparren
who
had
hitherto
been
exempted
resolved
to
resist
so
heavy
an
impost
they
rang
the
bell
with
violence
to
call
together
the
inhabitants
even
the
women
assembled
in
bands
with
spits
pitchforks
and
sickles
to
the
sound
of
a
drum
which
one
of
their
number
beat
before
them
the
mob
amounting
to
two
thousand
entrenched
themselves
in
the
public
cemetery
where
they
received
with
howls
of
rage
the
five
brigades
the
governor
of
bayonne
was
obliged
to
send
for
the
enforcement
of
the
law
bloodshed
was
prevented
by
the
venerable
who
rose
from
his
and
appeared
in
their
midst
by
his
mild
persuasive
words
he
calmed
the
excited
crowd
induced
the
troops
to
retire
and
the
mob
to
disperse
the
leaders
being
afterwards
arrested
he
also
effected
their
pardon
on
humiliating
conditions
however
to
the
town
the
hardest
was
perhaps
the
destruction
of
the
belfry
from
which
they
had
rung
the
alarm
and
it
was
not
till
some
time
in
the
present
century
they
were
allowed
to
rebuild
it
it
is
remarkable
that
the
ancient
basques
left
no
poems
no
to
celebrate
their
valorous
deeds
no
epic
in
which
some
adventurous
mariner
recites
his
wanderings
for
the
language
is
flexible
and
easily
bends
to
rhythm
but
the
people
seem
better
musicians
than
poets
there
are
to
be
sure
some
rude
plaints
of
love
a
few
or
songs
sung
to
bold
airs
full
of
wild
harmony
that
perhaps
used
to
animate
their
forefathers
to
fight
against
the
moors
but
these
songs
have
no
literary
merit
only
two
poems
in
the
language
have
acquired
a
certain
celebrity
because
published
by
prominent
men
who
ascribed
to
them
a
great
antiquity
one
of
these
is
the
des
published
by
wilhelm
von
humboldt
in
in
connection
with
an
essay
on
the
basque
language
ushered
into
the
world
by
so
distinguished
a
linguist
it
was
eagerly
welcomed
by
german
and
regarded
as
a
precious
memorial
of
past
ages
von
humboldt
took
it
from
the
mss
of
a
spaniard
employed
in
to
explore
the
archives
of
simancas
and
biscay
he
pretended
to
have
found
it
written
on
an
old
parchment
as
well
it
might
be
if
done
soon
after
the
invasion
of
the
country
by
the
romans
we
wonder
he
did
not
also
find
the
history
of
the
conquest
of
cantabria
in
five
books
composed
by
the
emperor
augustus
himself
said
to
have
been
in
existence
in
the
xviith
century
the
is
said
to
have
been
discovered
by
la
tour
in
an
old
convent
at
sebastian
in
written
on
parchment
in
characters
of
the
xiiith
or
xivth
century
it
is
unfortunate
so
valuable
a
like
the
original
poems
of
ossian
should
have
been
lost
the
contents
however
were
preserved
and
published
in
and
though
now
considered
spurious
merit
a
certain
attention
because
formerly
regarded
as
genuine
by
such
men
as
victor
hugo
who
in
his
des
speaks
of
charlemagne
as
de

enthusiastically
exclaims

i
say
of
the
basque
chants
and
where
did
this
people
on
their
inaccessible
heights
obtain
such
boldness
of
rhythm
and
intonation
every
basque
air
i
know
is
grand
and
decided
in
tone
but
none
more
strikingly
so
than
the
national
chant
of
the
escualdunacs
as
they
call
themselves
in
their
language
and
yet
this
fine
poem
has
for
some
of
its
lines
only
the
cardinal
numbers
up
to
twenty
and
then
repeated
in
reverse
order
often
while
listening
to
the
pure
fresh
melody
of
this
air
i
have
wondered
what
meaning
was
concealed
beneath
these
singular
lines
from
one
hypothesis
to
another
i
have
gone
back
to
the
time
when
the
vascon
race
hedged
in
at
the
foot
of
the
pyrenees
by
the
celtic
invaders
sought
refuge
among
the
inaccessible
mountains
then
it
seemed
to
me
this
was
composed
as
a
in
which
after
recounting
one
by
one
their
years
of
exile
they
numbered
with
the
same
regularity
but
in
a
contrary
direction
their
deeds
of
vengeance
such
is
the
power
of
imagination
it
is
the
tournamine

let
us
give
the
literal
translation
of
the
lines
in
which
olivier
finds
such
an
expression
of
sublime
vengeance

come
what

the

i
our
impressions
it
is
probable
that
most
of
us
have
been
at
some
time
in
our
intellectual
and
spiritual
life
conscious
of
a
divergence
between
our
mental
impressions
and
our
received
belief
respecting
the
nature
and
characteristics
of
the
divine
being
outside
the
boundaries
of
our
faith
there
has
been
as
it
were
a
margin
of
waste
land
which
we
seldom
explore
but
the
undefined
uncultivated
products
of
which
flit
athwart
our
imagination
with
something
like
an
uncomfortable
misgiving
we
do
not
go
far
into
it
because
we
have
our
certain
landmarks
to
stand
by
and
while
the
sun
of
faith
shines
bright
on
these
we
can
say
to
ourselves
that
we
have
nothing
really
to
do
with
the
sort
of
which
surrounds
our
own
happy
enclosure
our
allotment
is
one
of
peace
within
the
true
fold
of
the
church
we
know
where
we
are
we
know
what
we
have
got
to
do
and
we
refuse
to
be
seriously
troubled
by
the
dubious
questions
which
may
possibly
never
disturb
us
unless
we
deliberately
turn
to
them
to
us
as
catholics
this
is
a
safe
resolve
we
know
the
church
can
not
err
we
believe
and
are
ready
absolutely
and
unreservedly
ready
to
believe
all
she
puts
before
us
as
claiming
our
belief
and
this
is
no
childish
superstition
it
is
no
unmanly
laying
down
of
our
inalienable
right
to
know
good
from
evil
it
is
no
wilful
deafness
or
deliberate
closing
of
our
eyes
it
is
the
absolutely
necessary
and
perfectly
inevitable
result
of
the
one
primary
foundation
of
all
our
belief
namely
that
the
church
is
the
organ
of
the
holy
ghost
the
infallible
utterance
of
an
infallible
voice
which
voice
is
none
other
and
no
less
than
the
voice
of
god
speaking
through
and
by
the
kingdom
which
comprises
the
church
of
god
with
this
once
firmly
fixed
in
our
hearts
and
intellects
nothing
can
disturb
us
even
supposing
something
to
be
defined
by
the
church
for
which
we
were
unprepared
as
was
the
case
with
some
on
the
definition
of
the
infallibility
of
the
sovereign
pontiff
still
these
surprises
if
surprises
they
be
can
be
no
otherwise
than
sweet
and
welcome
to
us
there
can
not
be
a
jarring
note
in
that
voice
which
is
the
voice
of
the
holy
ghost
the
trumpet
can
not
give
a
false
sound
it
is
our
fault
either
intellectually
our
fault
which
is
rather
a
misfortune
than
a
fault
or
spiritually
which
is
from
our
negligence
and
lukewarmness
if
the
blast
of
that
trumpet
painfully
startle
us
from
our
slumbers
to
all
who
are
waking
and
watching
the
sound
can
only
be
cheering
and
encouraging
the
good
soldier
is
ever
ready
to
hear
it
and
prompt
to
obey
the
slumberer
is
among
those
to
whom
our
lord
says
know
how
to
discern
the
face
of
the
sky
and
can
you
not
know
the
signs
of
the
times
he
evidently
expects
us
to
know
the
signs
of
the
times
the
lord
is
not
in
the
strong
wind
nor
is
he
in
the
earthquake
or
the
fire
he
is
in
the
gentle
air
but
the
wind
and
the
earthquake
and
the
fire
are
his
precursors
and
those
who
have
experienced
and
heard
and
witnessed
these
warnings
should
be
all
attention
for
the
softer
sound
which
is
the
utterance
of
the
divine
voice
in
the
church
there
should
be
no
surprise
save
the
surprise
of
a
great
joy
the
admiring
astonishment
of
finding
out
how
good
our
god
is
and
what
marvellous
treasures
of
things
new
and
old
our
great
mother
the
church
lays
before
us
from
time
to
time
as
the
spirit
of
god
moves
over
the
ocean
of
divine
love
as
it
were
incubating
the
creations
of
the
world
of
grace
we
lie
down
in
our
certainty
as
the
infant
lies
down
in
its
lap
and
we
rise
on
the
wings
of
hope
and
faith
as
the
lark
rises
in
the
morning
light
without
the
shadow
of
a
doubt
that
the
lambient
air
will
uphold
the
little
fluttering
wings
with
which
it
carries
its
joyous
song
to
the
gates
of
heaven
underneath
us
are
the
arms
and
therefore
we
in
safety
and
alone
as
regards
those
outside
the
church
who
can
not
understand
our
security
because
they
have
never
grasped
the
idea
that
the
voice
of
the
church
being
the
voice
of
the
third
person
of
the
trinity
to
doubt
the
church
is
the
same
as
to
say
that
god
is
a
liar
if
we
have
dwelt
thus
at
length
upon
our
certitude
and
upon
the
intellectual
and
spiritual
repose
it
gives
us
we
have
done
so
for
the
purpose
of
making
it
absolutely
impossible
for
our
readers
to
suppose
that
when
we
speak
of
a
divergence
between
some
of
our
mental
impressions
and
our
received
belief
we
are
in
any
degree
insinuating
that
we
have
not
got
all
we
require
in
the
absolute
and
definite
teaching
of
the
church
or
that
we
have
any
cause
to
feel
troubled
about
any
question
which
the
church
has
left
as
an
open
question
and
respecting
which
any
one
of
us
individually
may
have
been
unable
to
arrive
at
a
conclusion
all
we
mean
is
this
that
there
are
certain
feelings
impressions
and
imaginings
which
we
find
it
hard
to
silence
and
extinguish
difficult
to
classify
in
accordance
with
our
substantial
belief
and
which
hang
about
us
like
a
sail
on
the
mast
of
a
vessel
which
the
unwary
crew
have
left
flapping
in
a
dangerous
gale
the
points
in
question
may
be
various
as
the
minds
that
contemplate
them
they
may
embrace
a
variety
of
subjects
and
may
assume
different
shapes
and
aspects
according
to
the
external
circumstances
under
which
they
present
themselves
or
to
the
color
of
our
own
thoughts
and
feelings
at
the
moment
they
are
before
us
their
field
is
so
vast
and
their
possible
variety
so
great
that
it
would
be
vain
for
us
to
attempt
to
give
even
a
glance
at
them
all
indeed
the
doing
so
is
beyond
our
capacity
and
would
be
beyond
the
capacity
of
any
one
man
for
who
shall
tell
what
is
fermenting
in
the
thoughts
of
one
even
of
his
he
can
merely
guess
blindly
at
the
souls
of
others
from
having
dwelt
in
the
depths
of
his
own
and
knowing
as
the
one
great
fact
that
all
men
are
brothers
we
are
far
therefore
from
intending
to
take
up
all
the
possible
questions
not
hedged
in
and
limited
and
defined
by
dogmatic
teaching
or
to
try
and
help
others
to
come
to
a
conclusion
on
each
we
might
as
well
attempt
to
count
the
sands
of
the
all
we
are
proposing
to
ourselves
for
our
own
consolation
and
if
possible
for
that
of
our
readers
is
to
lay
hold
of
certain
facts
which
will
give
a
clew
to
other
less
certain
facts
and
in
short
if
we
may
be
allowed
to
resort
to
a
chemical
term
to
indicate
certain
solvents
which
will
hold
in
solution
the
little
pebbles
that
lie
in
our
path
and
which
might
grow
into
great
had
we
not
a
strong
dissolving
power
always
at
our
command
it
is
that
there
is
one
knowledge
which
contains
all
other
knowledge
and
that
is
the
knowledge
of
god
as
all
things
flow
from
him
therefore
all
things
are
in
him
and
if
we
could
see
or
know
him
we
should
know
all
the
rest
that
knowledge
that
seeing
is
the
of
its
perfection
is
only
compatible
with
the
beatific
vision
which
vision
is
impossible
to
mere
man
in
his
condition
of
or
pilgrim
it
is
the
conclusion
of
faith
just
as
broad
noon
is
the
termination
of
darkness
but
as
faith
is
the
leading
up
to
the
beatific
vision
to
the
light
of
glory
and
to
the
knowledge
of
all
things
therefore
in
its
degree
is
it
the
best
substitute
for
sight
the
dawning
of
a
more
perfect
day
and
the
beginning
of
knowledge
consequently
is
the
evidence
of
things
that
appear
and
as
it
is
some
of
the
things
appear
which
are
puzzling
and
bewildering
many
of
us
let
us
lay
hold
of
our
faith
and
go
whither
it
shall
lead
us
we
can
in
this
life
only
know
god
mediately
and
obscurely
by
reason
and
faith
but
as
the
direct
and
clear
intuition
of
god
in
the
beatific
vision
will
include
the
knowledge
of
all
else
so
even
our
present
imperfect
knowledge
of
him
comprises
in
a
certain
sense
all
other
and
lesser
science
and
is
necessary
to
the
highest
knowledge
of
created
things
to
do
this
thoroughly
we
will
investigate
the
occasional
divergence
between
our
mental
impressions
as
we
sometimes
experience
them
and
our
received
belief
of
the
divine
nature
and
characteristics
in
a
burst
of
holy
exultation
paul
asks
hath
known
the
mind
of
the
lord
not
as
though
regretting
his
ignorance
but
rather
with
the
feelings
of
one
who
having
suddenly
come
upon
an
evidently
priceless
treasure
exclaims
who
can
tell
what
wealth
now
lies
before
us
yes
indeed
we
know
him
well
while
we
know
him
but
imperfectly
there
is
more
to
know
than
we
can
guess
at
but
our
hearts
are
too
narrow
to
hold
it
and
yet
sometimes
how
full
to
overflowing
has
that
knowledge
seemed
have
we
not
followed
him
from
the
cradle
to
the
grave
in
that
sweet
brotherhood
which
he
has
established
with
each
one
of
us
have
we
not
lost
ourselves
in
thoughts
of
how
and
where
he
was
when
his
brotherhood
with
us
was
not
an
accomplished
fact
but
only
an
divine
intention
with
his
own
eternal
existence
a
phase
of
that
very
existence
for
ever
present
to
the
divine
idea
though
not
yet
subjected
to
the
conditions
of
time
we
have
thought
of
him
as
in
the
bosom
of
the
father
in
a
way
in
which
wonderful
to
relate
he
never
can
be
again
in
the
bosom
of
the
father
a
something
has
passed
in
respect
to
the
existence
of
god
himself
and
actually
made
a
difference
in
the
extrinsic
relations
of
the
divine
being
there
was
an
eternity
in
which
the
son
of
god
he
whom
we
most
seem
to
know
of
the
three
persons
of
the
trinity
dwelt
in
the
bosom
of
the
father
unconnected
with
his
sacred
humanity
there
was
an
eternity
when
his
name
was
not
jesus
when
he
was
the
son
of
god
only
and
not
the
son
of
man
we
are
expressing
what
everybody
knows
who
is
a
christian
a
platitude
almost
and
yet
so
full
of
wonder
that
unless
we
have
thoroughly
gone
into
it
and
sifted
it
we
have
not
ransacked
half
the
riches
of
what
we
can
and
may
know
of
the
of
the
in
truth
we
are
very
apt
to
be
repelled
by
this
contemplation
there
is
something
dreary
to
us
in
the
eternity
when
the
brother
of
our
race
and
the
spouse
of
our
souls
was
only
the
everlasting
begotten
of
the
father
dwelling
in
that
inscrutable
eternity
to
which
we
as
the
creatures
of
time
seem
to
have
no
link
our
thoughts
and
imaginations
are
shackled
by
the
conditions
of
our
own
being
yesterday
we
were
not
and
so
all
before
yesterday
seems
like
a
blank
to
us
we
know
will
be
if
not
for
us
in
this
identical
state
yet
certainly
for
us
in
some
other
state
but
that
dim
yesterday
which
never
began
and
of
which
no
history
can
be
written
no
details
given
only
the
great
grand
inarticulated
statement
made
that
the
qui
est
the
am
filled
it
this
appalls
us
can
nothing
be
done
to
mitigate
this
stupendous
though
beautiful
horror
is
there
no
corner
into
which
our
insignificance
can
creep
that
so
we
may
look
out
upon
those
unknown
depths
without
feeling
that
we
are
plunging
into
a
fathomless
ocean
there
to
sink
in
blank
darkness
and
inanition
surely
the
god
of
the
past
as
from
our
point
of
view
we
reckon
the
past
should
not
be
so
appallingly
unknown
to
us
who
have
our
beloved
jesus
in
the
present
and
who
look
forward
to
the
beatific
vision
of
the
whole
blessed
trinity
with
trembling
hope
in
the
future
but
before
we
can
in
any
degree
overcome
the
stupor
with
which
we
think
of
the
ages
of
eternity
we
must
endeavor
more
fully
to
realize
the
nature
of
time
we
are
all
apt
to
speak
of
time
as
a
period
whereas
it
is
more
properly
a
state
the
generality
of
persons
in
thinking
of
time
in
relation
to
eternity
represent
to
themselves
a
long
long
ago
blind
past
and
then
an
interminable
but
partially
appreciable
future
and
time
lying
as
a
sort
of
period
between
the
two
which
slice
is
attached
to
the
eternity
behind
and
the
eternity
in
front
and
about
which
we
have
the
comfort
and
satisfaction
of
being
able
to
write
history
and
chronicle
events
either
on
a
large
or
a
small
scale
we
treat
it
as
we
should
do
a
mountain
of
gold
which
we
coin
into
money
and
we
conveniently
cut
it
up
into
ages
years
months
days
and
hours
it
is
our
nature
so
to
do
and
we
can
not
do
otherwise
it
is
the
condition
of
our
being
but
as
it
will
not
be
always
the
condition
of
our
being
there
are
few
things
we
are
more
constantly
exhorted
to
than
the
attempt
to
raise
our
imagination
or
rather
our
faith
as
much
as
possible
out
of
these
conventional
and
arbitrary
trammels
and
dispose
ourselves
for
that
other
state
which
is
our
ultimate
end
and
where
there
are
no
years
and
no
days
in
point
of
fact
time
is
only
an
imperfection
of
our
being
an
absolutely
necessary
imperfection
because
our
being
is
finite
and
our
state
is
a
probationary
state
and
probation
implies
not
only
that
succession
which
is
necessary
in
every
finite
being
but
change
and
movement
in
respect
to
things
which
are
permanent
in
a
more
perfect
state
our
condition
in
time
has
not
inaptly
been
compared
to
that
of
a
man
looking
through
the
small
aperture
of
a
which
only
permits
him
to
behold
a
section
of
what
is
passing
the
figures
appear
and
vanish
but
the
window
is
thrown
wide
open
in
eternity
and
he
sees
the
whole
at
once
he
is
therefore
under
a
disadvantage
so
long
as
he
is
in
the
viewing
the
landscape
through
a
small
hole
and
this
is
our
position
judging
of
eternity
through
the
aperture
of
time
even
now
we
have
a
wonderful
power
of
adding
to
our
time
or
of
shortening
it
without
any
reference
to
clocks
or
and
which
if
we
think
about
it
will
help
to
show
us
that
time
is
a
plastic
accident
of
our
being
when
we
have
been
very
much
absorbed
we
have
taken
no
note
of
time
and
the
hours
have
flown
like
minutes
during
that
interval
we
have
as
it
were
made
our
own
time
and
modified
our
condition
with
reference
to
time
by
our
own
act
time
therefore
is
plastic
were
we
by
some
extraordinary
and
exceptional
power
to
accomplish
in
one
day
all
that
actually
we
now
take
a
year
to
effect
but
at
the
same
time
intellectually
to
retain
our
present
perception
of
the
succession
of
events
our
life
would
not
really
have
been
shorter
for
the
want
of
those
three
hundred
and
days
which
we
had
been
able
to
do
without
life
is
shorter
now
than
it
was
in
the
days
of
the
patriarchs
but
possibly
the
perception
of
life
is
not
shortened
nay
rather
from
the
rapidity
with
which
events
are
now
permitted
to
succeed
each
other
partially
owing
to
the
progress
of
science
and
to
increased
dominion
over
material
force
the
probability
is
that
our
lives
are
not
abstractedly
much
if
at
all
more
brief
than
nine
hundred
and
thirty
years
all
things
now
are
hastening
to
the
end
they
have
always
been
hastening
but
there
is
the
added
impetus
of
the
past
and
that
increases
with
every
age
in
the
history
now
let
us
imagine
life
or
a
portion
of
life
without
thought
that
is
without
the
act
of
thinking
immediately
we
find
that
it
is
next
door
to
to
no
time
and
no
life
we
can
only
measure
life
with
any
accuracy
by
the
amount
of
thought
which
has
filled
it
that
is
by
the
quantity
of
our
intellectual
and
spiritual
power
which
we
have
been
able
to
bring
to
the
small
aperture
in
the
by
which
to
contemplate
the
eternity
which
lies
beyond
and
cut
it
up
into
the
sections
we
call
time
another
example
will
show
us
how
plastic
is
the
nature
of
time
take
the
life
of
an
animal
we
are
inclined
to
give
the
largest
reasonable
and
possible
importance
to
the
brute
creation
it
is
an
open
question
in
which
we
see
great
seeds
of
future
development
all
tending
to
increased
glory
to
the
creator
and
to
further
elucidation
of
creative
love
nevertheless
it
is
obvious
that
brutes
perceive
only
or
chiefly
by
moments
there
is
as
compared
with
ourselves
little
or
no
sequence
in
their
perceptions
there
is
no
cumulative
knowledge
they
are
without
deliberate
reflection
even
where
they
are
not
without
perception
of
relations
and
circumstances
past
or
future
consequently
they
are
more
rigorously
subjects
to
time
than
ourselves
therefore
when
we
deprive
an
animal
of
life
we
deprive
him
of
a
remainder
of
time
that
is
equal
to
little
more
than
no
time
in
proportion
to
the
degree
in
which
his
power
of
filling
time
with
perception
is
less
than
our
own
all
we
have
said
tends
to
prove
that
the
existence
of
time
is
a
relative
existence
it
is
the
form
or
phase
of
our
own
finite
being
it
is
an
aspect
of
eternity
the
aspect
which
is
consistent
with
our
present
condition
for
time
is
the
measure
of
successive
existence
in
created
and
finite
beings
as
finite
spirits
we
can
not
escape
from
this
limit
of
successive
existence
any
more
than
a
body
can
escape
from
the
limit
of
locality
and
finite
movement
in
grace
eternal
existence
is
the
entire
possession
of
life
which
is
illimitable
in
such
a
perfect
manner
that
all
succession
in
duration
is
excluded
this
is
possible
only
in
god
himself
who
is
alone
most
pure
and
perfect
act
and
therefore
is
at
once
all
he
can
be
without
change
or
movement
but
the
created
spirit
must
ever
live
by
a
perpetual
movement
of
increase
in
its
duration
because
it
is
on
every
side
finite
time
therefore
will
continue
to
exist
while
creatures
continue
to
exist
having
arrived
at
this
conclusion
we
can
not
refuse
ourselves
the
satisfaction
of
pointing
out
one
obvious
deduction
namely
that
if
time
has
in
itself
only
a
relative
existence
it
is
impossible
it
can
ever
put
an
end
to
the
existence
of
anything
else
it
is
inconceivable
that
the
can
absorb
exterminate
annihilate
or
obliterate
any
one
single
thing
that
has
ever
had
one
second
of
real
existence
of
permitted
being
of
sentient
or
even
of
insentient
life
god
can
annihilate
if
he
so
will
and
we
do
not
think
he
will
but
time
can
not
time
can
hide
and
put
away
it
can
slip
between
us
and
the
only
reality
which
is
eternity
that
is
the
condition
of
god
the
qui
est
wait
awhile
and
time
will
have
as
it
were
spread
or
overflowed
into
eternity
it
will
hide
nothing
from
our
view
it
will
be
in
two
from
the
top
to
the
bottom
from
the
beginning
to
the
end
like
the
veil
of
the
temple
which
is
its
symbol
and
then
will
appear
all
that
it
has
hitherto
seemed
but
only
seemed
to
distinguish
we
shall
find
it
all
in
the
inner
recesses
of
eternity
what
cause
in
point
of
fact
have
we
for
supposing
that
anything
which
shall
cease
to
exist
why
because
we
no
longer
behold
certain
objects
do
we
imagine
them
to
be
really
lost
for
ever
is
this
a
reasonable
supposition
on
the
part
of
beings
who
are
conscious
that
once
they
themselves
were
not
and
yet
believe
that
they
always
shall
be
why
should
the
mere
diversity
in
other
existences
make
us
apprehend
that
the
missing
is
also
the
lost
and
that
we
have
any
substantial
cause
for
doubting
that
all
which
exists
will
go
on
existing
do
we
anywhere
see
symptoms
of
annihilation
it
is
true
we
see
endless
mutations
but
those
very
mutations
are
a
guarantee
to
us
of
the
continuousness
of
being
all
material
things
change
but
they
only
change
they
do
not
ever
in
any
case
go
out
and
cease
to
be
if
this
be
true
of
merely
material
things
how
absolutely
true
must
it
be
of
the
immaterial
and
how
more
than
probable
of
that
which
is
partly
one
and
partly
the
other
of
that
far
lower
nature
of
the
brutes
which
have
a
principle
of
life
in
them
inferior
to
ours
and
superior
to
the
plants
and
of
which
since
we
do
not
believe
their
sensations
to
be
the
result
of
certain
fortuitous
atoms
that
have
fashioned
themselves
blindly
after
an
inexorable
law
and
independently
of
an
intelligent
lawgiver
we
may
reasonably
predicate
that
they
too
will
have
a
future
and
in
its
proper
inferior
order
an
advanced
existence
everywhere
there
is
growth
through
the
phases
of
time
into
the
portals
of
eternity
the
idea
in
the
eternal
mind
of
all
essences
the
least
as
well
as
the
greatest
was
like
the
mind
that
held
it
eternal
that
is
exempt
from
all
limit
of
succession
the
past
present
and
future
are
the
progressive
modes
of
existence
and
of
our
own
perceptions
rather
than
the
properties
of
the
essences
themselves
those
essences
had
a
place
in
the
eternal
idea
they
occupy
an
actual
place
as
an
actual
existence
in
the
phases
of
time
and
they
go
on
in
all
probability
may
we
not
say
in
all
certainty
in
the
endlessness
of
the
intention
let
no
one
misunderstand
this
as
implying
that
matter
was
eternal
in
any
other
sense
than
its
essence
being
an
object
of
the
idea
of
the
eternal
god
it
was
always
clearly
present
to
the
eternal
mind
its
actuality
as
we
know
it
dates
from
this
creation
of
the
crude
chaotic
mass
but
once
formed
and
then
fashioned
and
finally
animated
we
can
have
no
pretence
for
supposing
that
any
part
of
it
will
ever
cease
to
be
nor
can
we
have
any
solid
reason
for
supposing
that
what
has
once
been
endowed
with
sentient
life
will
ever
be
condemned
to
fall
back
into
the
all
but
infinitely
lower
form
of
mere
organic
matter
any
more
than
we
have
reason
to
suppose
that
at
some
future
period
organic
matter
will
be
reduced
to
inorganic
matter
and
that
out
of
this
beautiful
creation
it
will
please
god
to
resolve
chaos
back
again
either
the
whole
or
in
any
one
the
smallest
part
we
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
difficulties
of
the
question
they
are
difficulties
entirely
of
detail
and
not
of
principle
and
they
concern
us
no
more
than
it
concerns
us
to
be
able
to
state
how
many
animalcula
it
took
to
heave
up
the
vast
sierras
of
the
western
hemisphere
the
details
may
well
puzzle
us
and
we
can
not
venture
on
the
merest
suggestion
but
the
principle
is
full
of
hope
joy
and
security
which
in
itself
is
a
presumption
in
its
favor
if
we
would
but
believe
how
god
values
the
work
of
his
own
hands
if
we
would
but
try
to
realize
how
intense
is
creative
love
what
much
larger
and
deeper
views
we
should
have
of
the
future
of
all
creation
and
of
the
glory
that
is
prepared
for
us
even
the
old
heathen
religions
began
by
taking
larger
and
more
accurate
measure
of
these
questions
though
they
necessarily
ended
in
error
than
too
many
of
us
do
with
all
the
light
of
the
gospel
thrown
upon
them
the
animism
of
the
heathens
which
makes
no
distinction
between
animate
and
inanimate
existence
but
lends
a
soul
to
each
alike
had
in
it
a
sort
of
loving
and
hopeful
reverence
for
creation
which
is
often
wanting
to
us
who
alone
truly
know
the
creator
in
their
blind
groping
after
faith
it
led
them
to
fetichism
and
further
on
as
a
fuller
development
of
the
same
notion
to
pantheism
and
then
to
the
and
quite
endless
incarnations
of
buddha
but
these
errors
took
their
rise
originally
from
a
respectful
and
tender
love
of
that
beautiful
though
awful
nature
which
man
found
lying
all
around
him
external
to
himself
yet
linked
to
himself
and
beneath
the
folds
of
which
he
hoped
to
find
the
hidden
deity
if
these
reflections
have
at
all
enabled
us
to
understand
the
nature
of
time
and
to
shake
off
some
of
the
unreasonable
importance
we
lend
to
it
in
our
imaginations
making
of
it
a
sort
of
lesser
rival
to
eternity
fashioning
it
into
an
actual
existing
thing
as
if
it
were
an
attribute
of
god
himself
instead
of
being
what
it
is
a
state
or
phase
imposed
upon
us
and
not
in
any
way
affecting
him
we
shall
have
done
much
to
facilitate
the
considerations
we
wish
to
enlarge
upon
eternity
is
it
is
the
of
theology
time
on
the
contrary
is
the
past
present
and
future
of
our
human
condition
the
of
theology
with
this
truth
well
rooted
in
our
minds
we
will
now
turn
to
the
investigation
of
some
of
those
impressions
to
which
we
referred
at
the
beginning
of
this
section
and
endeavor
to
throw
light
upon
them
from
out
of
the
additional
knowledge
we
acquire
of
the
nature
and
characteristics
of
the
divine
being
through
the
simple
process
of
clearing
away
some
of
our
false
impressions
with
respect
to
time
we
had
in
our
modes
of
thought
more
or
less
hemmed
in
the
eternal
with
our
human
sense
of
time
and
subjected
even
him
to
the
narrowing
process
of
a
past
present
and
future
now
we
are
about
to
think
of
ourselves
only
in
that
position
and
to
contemplate
him
in
eternity
dealing
with
us
through
the
medium
of
time
but
distinctly
with
a
reference
to
eternity
and
only
apparently
imposing
on
himself
the
conditions
of
time
in
order
to
bring
himself
as
it
were
on
a
level
with
us
in
his
dealings
with
us
strange
as
it
may
appear
out
of
the
depths
of
our
stupidity
we
have
fabricated
a
difficulty
to
ourselves
in
his
very
condescensions
and
looking
back
from
our
present
to
the
past
we
find
ourselves
puzzled
at
certain
divers
revelations
of
god
made
to
mankind
in
times
just
as
in
the
weakness
of
our
faith
we
are
sometimes
troubled
with
doubts
about
our
own
condition
and
that
of
those
about
us
in
that
future
which
must
come
and
which
may
not
be
far
off
to
any
one
of
us
the
god
of
abraham
and
isaac
and
jacob
is
he
really
quite
the
same
as
our
own
god
our
god
of
the
womb
of
mary
of
the
manger
of
the
wayside
places
in
palestine
and
mount
calvary
and
now
of
the
tabernacle
and
the
blessed
eucharist
and
the
dear
ineffable
moments
of
silent
prayer
is
he
the
same
of
course
we
know
that
literally
and
absolutely
he
is
the
same
yesterday
and
for
ever
nevertheless
he
appears
to
us
under
such
different
aspects
that
we
find
ourselves
unintentionally
contemplating
the
old
testament
as
a
revelation
of
the
divine
being
with
very
different
emotions
from
those
with
which
we
contemplate
him
in
the
new
testament
and
this
again
differing
widely
from
our
view
of
him
in
the
church
it
may
be
a
mere
matter
of
feeling
perhaps
but
it
is
nevertheless
a
feeling
which
materially
influences
our
form
of
devotion
the
vigor
of
our
faith
and
the
power
of
our
hope
and
love
if
we
could
take
in
all
these
different
impressions
and
amalgamate
them
if
we
could
group
them
together
or
make
them
like
the
several
rays
of
light
directed
into
one
focus
we
should
obtain
a
more
complete
and
a
more
influential
knowledge
of
god
than
we
can
do
while
we
seem
rather
to
be
wandering
out
of
one
view
of
him
into
another
as
if
we
walked
from
chamber
to
chamber
and
closed
each
door
behind
us
now
the
only
way
we
can
arrive
at
this
is
by
bearing
in
mind
that
the
acts
of
god
in
governing
the
world
are
not
momentary
and
solitary
facts
but
continuous
acts
or
rather
one
continuous
act
our
difficulty
lies
in
producing
a
visibly
satisfactory
harmony
in
our
own
minds
as
regards
the
acts
of
god
and
thus
though
for
our
own
appreciation
of
them
they
are
to
us
broken
up
into
fragments
or
in
other
terms
into
separate
facts
arriving
at
the
same
mental
attitude
towards
them
as
though
we
saw
them
as
one
continuous
act
it
will
aid
us
in
our
search
if
we
first
of
all
endeavor
to
qualify
that
act
its
very
continuity
its
perpetual
instantaneousness
must
essentially
affect
its
character
and
make
the
definition
no
complex
matter
it
is
an
act
of
love
and
it
is
revealed
as
such
in
the
whole
creation
and
in
the
way
god
has
let
himself
down
to
us
and
is
drawing
us
up
unto
himself
there
have
been
many
apparent
modifications
but
there
have
been
no
actual
contradictions
in
this
characteristic
for
even
the
existence
of
evil
works
round
to
greater
good
to
a
degree
sufficiently
obvious
to
us
for
us
to
know
that
where
it
is
less
obvious
it
must
nevertheless
follow
the
same
law
for
law
is
everywhere
because
god
is
law
though
law
is
not
god
modern
unbelief
substitutes
law
for
god
and
then
thinks
it
has
done
away
with
him
to
us
who
believe
it
makes
no
difference
how
far
back
in
the
long
continuous
line
of
active
forces
we
may
find
the
original
and
divine
author
of
all
force
it
is
nothing
but
the
weakness
of
our
imagination
which
makes
it
more
difficult
to
count
by
millions
than
by
units
what
does
it
matter
to
our
faith
through
how
many
developments
the
condition
of
creation
as
we
now
see
it
all
around
us
may
have
passed
when
we
know
that
the
first
idea
sprang
from
the
great
source
of
all
law
and
that
with
him
the
present
state
is
as
much
one
continuous
act
as
the
past
state
and
the
future
state
you
may
trace
back
the
whole
material
universe
if
you
will
to
the
one
first
molecule
of
chaotic
matter
but
so
long
as
i
find
that
first
molecule
in
the
hand
of
my
creator
and
i
defy
you
to
put
it
anywhere
else
it
is
enough
for
my
faith
you
do
not
make
him
one
whit
the
less
my
creator
and
my
god
because
an
initial
law
or
force
with
which
he
then
stamped
it
has
worked
it
out
to
what
i
now
see
it
you
may
increase
the
apparent
distance
between
the
world
as
it
is
actually
and
the
divine
fount
from
whence
it
sprang
you
may
seem
to
remove
the
creative
love
which
called
the
universe
into
existence
further
off
by
thus
lengthening
the
chain
of
what
you
call
developments
but
after
all
these
developments
are
for
ever
bridged
over
by
the
ulterior
intentions
of
the
triune
deity
when
he
said
us
make
man
in
our
image
and
by
the
fact
that
space
and
time
are
mere
accidents
as
viewed
in
relation
to
the
qui
est
they
are
so
to
speak
conventionalities
through
which
the
divinity
touches
upon
our
human
condition
but
which
in
no
way
affect
the
divine
essence
as
it
is
in
itself
on
the
contrary
in
the
developments
and
evolutions
which
you
believe
you
trace
and
which
you
want
to
make
into
a
blind
law
which
shall
supersede
a
divine
creator
i
see
only
the
pulsations
of
time
breaking
up
the
perpetually
instantaneous
act
of
god
just
as
i
see
the
pulsations
of
light
in
the
one
unbroken
ray
the
act
of
god
passes
through
the
medium
of
time
before
it
reaches
our
ken
and
the
ray
of
light
passes
through
the
medium
of
air
before
it
strikes
our
senses
but
both
are
continuous
and
instantaneous
if
we
have
in
any
degree
succeeded
in
establishing
this
to
our
satisfaction
it
will
become
easier
for
us
to
estimate
the
acts
of
god
as
they
come
to
us
through
the
pulsations
of
time
because
we
shall
be
able
to
bear
in
mind
that
they
must
be
in
a
measure
interpreted
to
us
by
the
time
through
which
they
reach
us
they
were
modified
by
the
time
in
which
they
were
revealed
much
as
the
ray
is
modified
by
the
substance
through
which
it
forces
its
way
to
us
now
we
arrive
at
the
causes
of
the
different
impressions
we
receive
of
the
nature
and
characteristics
of
the
divine
being
they
are
a
consequence
of
the
different
epochs
in
which
we
contemplate
him
they
are
the
pulsations
appropriate
to
that
epoch
other
pulsations
belong
to
our
portion
of
time
and
to
our
consequent
view
of
the
divine
being
and
so
on
and
on
till
time
shall
be
swallowed
up
in
eternity
and
the
beatific
vision
burst
upon
us
to
be
continued

in
maine

to
blood
of
the
martyrs

the
seed
of
the
to
the
historical
student
the
following
paper
can
have
but
trifling
value
as
the
writer
makes
no
pretension
to
originality
of
matter
and
seeks
but
to
bring
within
the
grasp
of
the
general
reader
in
a
condensed
form
the
gist
of
many
books
a
large
number
of
which
are
rare
and
almost
inaccessible
it
is
hoped
however
that
there
are
many
persons
who
will
read
with
interest
a
paper
thus
compiled
from
undoubted
authorities
who
have
neither
the
time
nor
the
inclination
to
consult
these
authorities
for
themselves
these
persons
will
learn
with
wonder
of
the
of
the
french
priests
who
went
forth
among
the
savages
with
their
lives
in
their
hands
with
but
one
thought
in
their
brains
one
wish
in
their
hearts
one
prayer

their
lips

that
of

was

bountiful

and
filled

still
powerful
at

he
laid
before
the
queen
the
facts
that
henri

had
been
deeply
interested
in
the
establishment
of

had
evinced
a
tangible
proof
of
that
interest
in
the

grant
of
two
thousand
livres
per

the
ambitious
queen
listened
indulgently
with
a
heart
softened
possibly
by
recent
sorrows
and
consented
to
receive
the

stood
silent
and
abashed
but
as
the
ladies
gathered
about
him
and
plied
him
with
questions
soon
forgot
himself
and
told
wondrous
tales
of
the
dusky
savages
of
their
strange
customs

of
their
eagerness
for
instruction
in

true

displayed
the

of

with
pious
emulation

one
whose
history
and

remarkable

account
of

throughout
france
not
only
for
her
grace
and
beauty
but
for
qualities
more
rare
at
the
court
where
her
youth
had
been
passed
when
antoinette
was
la
duchesse
de
rochefoucauld
the
king
begged
her
to
accept
a
position
near
the
queen
he
said
as
he
presented
her
to
marie
de
médicis
give
you
a
lady
of
honor
who
is
a
lady
of
honor
twenty
years
had
come
and
gone
the
youthful
beauty
of
the
had
faded
but
she
was
fair
and
stately
still
and
one
of
the
most
brilliant
ornaments
of
the
brilliant
court
and
yet
she
was
not
altogether
worldly
again
a
widow
and
without
children
she
had
become
sincerely
religious
and
threw
herself
heart
and
soul
into
the
american
missions
and
was
restrained
only
by
the
positive
commands
of
her
mistress
the
queen
from
herself
seeking
the
new
world
day
and
night
she
thought
of
these
perishing
souls
on
her
knees
in
her
oratory
she
prayed
for
the
indians
and
contented
herself
not
with
this
alone
from
the
queen
and
from
the
ladies
of
the
court
she
obtained
money
and
jewels
that
could
be
converted
into
money
charlevoix
tells
us
that
the
only
difficulty
was
to
restrain
her
ardor
within
reasonable
bounds
two
french
priests
paul
biard
and
enémond
massé
were
sent
to
dieppe
there
to
take
passage
for
the
colonies
the
vessel
was
engaged
by
poutrincourt
and
his
associates
and
was
partially
owned
by
two
huguenot
merchants
who
persistently
and
with
indignation
refused
to
permit
the
embarkation
of
the
priests
no
entreaties
or
representations
availed
and
finally
la
marquise
bought
out
the
interest
of
the
two
merchants
in
the
vessel
and
cargo
and
transferred
it
to
the
priests
as
a
fund
for
their
support
at
last
the
fathers
set
sail
on
the
of
january
their
troubles
however
were
by
no
means
over
for
biencourt
a
mere
lad
clothed
in
a
little
brief
authority
manly
it
is
true
beyond
his
years
hampered
them
at
every
turn
they
arrived
at
port
royal
in
june
after
a
hazardous
and
tempestuous
voyage
having
seen
as
father
biard
writes
icebergs
taller
and
larger
than
the
church
of
notre
dame
the
fathers
became
discouraged
by
the
constant
interference
of
young
biencourt
and
determined
to
return
to
europe
unless
they
could
with
mme
de
aid
found
a
mission
colony
in
some
other
spot
their
zealous
protectress
obtained
from
de
monts
who
though
a
protestant
had
erected
six
years
before
the
first
cross
in
maine
at
the
mouth
of
the
kennebec
a
transfer
of
all
his
claims
to
the
lands
of
acadia
and
soon
sent
out
a
small
vessel
with
forty
colonists
commanded
by
la
saussaye
a
nobleman
and
having
on
board
two
jesuit
priests
fathers
du
thet
and
quentin
it
was
on
the
of
march
that
this
vessel
left
honfleur
laden
with
supplies
and
followed
by
prayers
and
benedictions
on
the
of
may
la
saussaye
reached
port
royal
and
there
took
on
board
fathers
massé
and
biard
and
then
set
sail
for
the
penobscot
a
heavy
fog
arose
and
encompassed
them
about
if
it
lifted
for
a
moment
it
was
but
to
show
them
a
white
gleam
of
distant
breakers
or
a
dark
overhanging
cliff
prayers
were
heard
wrote
biard
at
night
the
stars
came
out
and
the
morning
sun
devoured
the
fogs
and
we
found
ourselves
lying
in
frenchmans
bay
opposite
mt
des
monts
déserts
had
been
visited
and
so
named
by
champlain
in
and
bay
gained
its
title
from
a
singular
incident
that
had
there
taken
place
in
the
same
spring
de
monts
had
broken
up
his
winter
encampment
at
croix
among
his
company
was
a
young
french
ecclesiastic
nicholas
who
to
gratify
his
curiosity
in
regard
to
the
products
of
the
soil
in
this
new
and
strange
country
insisted
on
being
set
ashore
for
a
ramble
of
a
few
hours
he
lost
his
way
and
the
boatmen
after
an
anxious
search
were
compelled
to
leave
him
for
eighteen
days
the
young
student
wandered
through
woods
subsisting
on
berries
and
the
roots
of
the
plant
known
as
seal
he
however
kept
carefully
near
the
shore
and
at
the
end
of
this
time
he
distinguished
a
sail
in
the
distance
signalling
this
he
was
fortunate
enough
to
be
taken
off
by
the
same
crew
that
had
landed
him
on
these
bleak
shores
the
colonists
decided
to
make
their
future
home
and
with
singular
infelicity
selected
them
as
the
site
of
the
new
colony
it
is
inconceivable
how
father
biard
who
had
already
spent
some
time
in
the
new
world
could
have
failed
to
suggest
to
la
saussaye
and
to
their
patroness
that
a
colony
to
be
a
success
must
be
not
only
in
a
spot
easily
accessible
to
france
but
that
a
small
force
of
armed
men
was
imperative
for
to
own
knowledge
the
english
had
already
seized
several
french
vessels
in
that
vicinity
on
these
frowning
shores
la
saussaye
landed
and
erected
a
cross
and
displayed
the
escutcheon
of
mme
de
guercheville
the
fathers
offered
the
holy
sacrifice
of
the
mass
and
gave
to
the
little
settlement
the
name
of
sauveur
four
tents
the
gift
of
the
queen
shone
white
in
the
soft
spring
sunshine
the
largest
of
these
was
used
as
a
chapel
the
decorations
of
which
with
the
silver
vessels
for
the
celebration
of
the
mass
and
the
rich
vestments
were
presented
by
henriette
marquise
de
verneuil
the
colonists
labored
night
and
day
to
raise
their
little
fort
and
to
land
their
supplies
their
toil
was
nearly
over
the
vessel
ready
for
sea
rode
at
anchor
when
a
sudden
and
violent
storm
arose
this
storm
had
been
felt
hours
earlier
off
the
isles
of
shoals
by
a
fishing
vessel
commanded
by
one
samuel
argall
thick
fogs
bewildered
him
and
a
strong
wind
drove
him
to
the
northeast
and
when
the
weather
cleared
argall
found
himself
off
the
coast
of
maine
canoes
came
out
like
flocks
of
birds
from
each
small
bay
the
indians
climbed
the
side
and
greeted
the
with
such
amazing
bows
and
flourishes
that
argall
with
his
native
acuteness
felt
certain
that
they
could
have
learned
them
only
from
the
french
who
could
not
be
far
away
argall
plied
the
indians
with
cunning
questions
and
soon
learned
of
the
new
settlement
he
resolved
to
investigate
farther
and
set
sail
for
the
wild
heights
of
mt
desert
with
infinite
patience
he
crept
along
through
the
many
islands
and
rounding
the
porcupines
saw
a
small
ship
anchored
in
the
bay
at
the
same
moment
the
french
saw
the
english
ship
bearing
down
upon
them
than
an
arrow
writes
father
biard
every
sail
set
and
the
english
flags
streaming
from
and
la
saussaye
was
within
the
fort
lieut
la
motte
on
board
with
father
du
thet
an
ensign
and
a
sergeant
argall
bore
down
amid
a
bewildering
din
of
drums
and
trumpets
cried
la
motte
alas
the
gunner
was
on
shore
father
du
thet
seized
and
applied
the
match
another
scathing
discharge
of
musketry
and
the
brave
priest
lay
dead
he
had
his
wish
for
the
day
before
he
left
france
he
prayed
with
uplifted
hands
that
he
might
not
return
but
perish
on
that
holy
enterprise
he
was
buried
the
following
day
at
the
foot
of
the
rough
cross
he
had
helped
to
erect
la
motte
enough
to
see
the
utter
uselessness
of
any
farther
attempt
at
defence
surrendered
and
argall
took
possession
of
the
vessel
and
of
la
papers
from
among
which
he
abstracted
the
royal
commission
on
la
return
from
the
woods
where
he
had
retreated
with
the
colonists
he
was
met
by
argall
who
informed
him
that
the
country
belonged
to
his
master
king
james
and
finally
asked
to
see
his
commission
in
vain
did
the
french
nobleman
search
for
it
courtesy
changed
to
wrath
he
accused
the
officer
of
piracy
and
ordered
the
settlement
to
be
given
up
to
pillage
but
offered
to
take
any
of
the
settlers
who
had
a
trade
back
to
virginia
with
him
promising
them
protection
argall
counted
however
without
his
host
for
on
reaching
jamestown
the
governor
swore
that
the
french
priests
should
be
hung
useless
were
remonstrances
and
finally
seeing
no
other
way
to
save
the
lives
of
the
fathers
he
produced
the
commission
and
acknowledged
his
stratagem
the
wrath
of
sir
thomas
dale
was
unappeased
but
the
lives
of
the
priests
were
of
course
safe
he
despatched
argall
with
two
additional
ships
back
to
mt
desert
with
orders
to
cut
down
the
cross
and
level
the
defences
father
biard
was
on
board
as
well
as
father
massé
they
with
refined
cruelty
being
sent
to
witness
the
destruction
of
their
hopes
this
work
of
destruction
completed
argall
set
sail
for
virginia
again
a
storm
arose
and
the
vessel
on
which
were
the
ecclesiastics
was
driven
to
the
azores
here
the
jesuits
who
had
been
so
grossly
had
but
a
few
words
to
say
to
be
avenged
the
captain
of
the
vessel
was
not
without
uneasiness
and
entreated
the
priests
to
remain
in
concealment
when
the
vessel
was
visited
by
the
authorities
this
visit
over
the
english
purchased
all
they
needed
and
weighed
anchor
for
england
arrived
there
a
new
difficulty
occurred
for
there
was
no
commission
to
show
the
captain
was
treated
as
a
pirate
thrown
into
prison
and
released
only
on
the
testimony
of
the
jesuit
fathers
who
thus
returned
good
for
evil
father
biard
hastened
to
france
where
he
became
professor
of
theology
at
lyons
and
died
at
avignon
on
the
of
november
father
massé
returned
to
canada
where
he
labored
without
ceasing
until
his
death
in
with
the
destruction
of
sauveur
the
pious
designs
of
mme
de
guercheville
seem
to
have
perished
at
any
rate
the
most
diligent
research
fails
to
find
her
name
again
in
the
annals
of
that
time
probably
the
troubled
state
of
france
made
it
impossible
for
her
to
provide
the
sinews
of
war
or
of
evangelization
nevertheless
the
good
seed
was
planted
and
zeal
for
the
mission
cause
again
revived
in
europe
particularly
in
the
society
of
jesus
young
men
left
court
and
camp
to
share
the
privations
and
life
of
of
the
missionaries
even
the
convents
partook
of
the
general
enthusiasm
and
ursuline
nuns
came
to
show
the
indians
christianity
in
daily
life
ministering
to
the
sick
and
instructing
the
young
many
years
after
the
melancholy
failure
of
the
mission
at
mt
desert
an
apparent
accident
recalled
the
jesuit
fathers
to
the
coast
of
maine
in
there
was
a
mission
at
sillery
on
the
lawrence
where
had
been
gathered
together
a
large
number
of
indian
converts
who
lived
with
their
families
about
them
in
peace
and
harmony
under
the
watchful
care
of
the
kind
fathers
among
these
converts
was
a
chief
who
to
rescue
some
of
his
tribe
who
had
been
taken
prisoners
started
off
through
the
pathless
wilderness
and
finally
reached
the
english
at
coussinoe
now
known
as
augusta
on
the
kennebec
there
the
indian
convert
so
extolled
the
christian
faith
and
its
mighty
promises
that
he
took
back
with
him
several
of
the
tribe
these
were
baptized
at
sillery
and
became
faithful
servants
of
our
lord
jesus
christ
in
consequence
of
the
entreaties
of
these
converts
father
gabriel
drouillettes
was
sent
to
the
lonely
kennebec
here
he
built
a
chapel
of
in
a
place
now
known
as
norridgewock
a
lovely
secluded
spot
some
years
before
father
biard
had
been
there
for
a
few
weeks
so
that
the
indians
were
not
totally
unprepared
to
receive
religious
instruction
father
drouillettes
was
greatly
blessed
in
his
teaching
and
converted
a
large
number
inspiring
them
with
a
profound
love
for
the
catholic
faith
which
the
english
twenty
years
before
had
failed
to
do
for
the
protestant
religion
he
taught
them
simple
prayers
and
translated
for
their
use
into
their
own
dialect
several
hymns
the
savages
even
learned
to
sing
and
it
was
not
long
before
the
solemn
strains
of
the
awakened
strange
echoes
in
the
primeval
forests
even
the
english
biassed
as
they
were
against
the
catholics
watched
the
good
accomplished
by
the
faithful
servant
of
the
great
master
and
learned
to
regard
his
coming
as
a
great
blessing
though
at
this
very
time
the
stern
puritans
at
plymouth
were
enacting
cruel
laws
against
his
order
when
the
indians
went
to
moosehead
lake
to
hunt
and
fish
father
drouillettes
went
with
them
watching
over
his
flock
with
unswerving
solicitude
but
the
day
of
his
summons
to
quebec
came
and
a
general
feeling
of
despair
overwhelmed
his
converts
he
went
and
the
assumption
mission
was
deserted
for
by
that
name
as
it
was
asked
for
on
that
day
was
this
mission
always
designated
year
after
year
the
abnakis
for
so
were
called
the
aborigines
of
maine
sent
deputations
to
quebec
to
entreat
the
return
of
their
beloved
priest
but
in
vain
for
the
number
of
missionaries
was
at
that
time
very
limited
finally
in
father
drouillettes
set
out
with
a
party
on
the
last
day
of
august
for
the
tiresome
eight
march
through
the
wilderness
the
party
lost
their
way
their
provisions
were
gone
and
it
was
not
until
days
afterwards
that
they
reached
norridgewock
from
a
letter
written
at
this
time
by
father
drouillettes
we
transcribe
the
following
spite
of
all
that
is
painful
and
crucifying
to
nature
in
these
missions
there
are
also
great
joys
and
consolations
more
plenteous
than
i
can
describe
are
those
i
feel
to
see
that
the
seed
of
the
gospel
i
scattered
here
four
years
ago
in
land
which
for
so
many
centuries
has
lain
fallow
or
produced
only
thorns
and
brambles
already
bears
fruit
so
worthy
of
the
nothing
could
exceed
the
veneration
and
affection
of
the
indians
for
their
missionary
and
when
an
englishman
vehemently
accused
the
french
priest
of
slandering
his
nation
the
chiefs
hurried
to
augusta
and
warned
the
authorities
to
take
heed
and
not
attack
their
father
even
in
words
the
following
spring
father
drouillettes
was
sent
to
a
station
and
years
elapsed
before
he
returned
to
quebec
where
he
died
in
at
the
age
of
about
this
time
two
brothers
vincent
and
jacques
bigot
men
of
rank
and
fortune
left
their
homes
in
sunny
france
to
share
the
toil
and
privations
of
life
in
the
new
world
they
placed
themselves
and
their
fortunes
in
the
hands
of
the
superior
at
quebec
and
were
sent
to
labor
in
the
footprints
of
father
drouillettes
during
their
faithful
ministrations
at
norridgewock
the
chapel
built
by
their
predecessor
was
burned
by
the
english
but
was
rebuilt
in
by
english
workmen
sent
from
boston
according
to
treaty
stipulations
and
now
appears
upon
the
scene
the
stately
form
of
one
of
the
greatest
men
of
that
age
but
before
we
attempt
to
bring
before
our
readers
the
character
and
acts
of
sebastian
râle
we
must
beg
them
to
turn
from
norridgewock
the
scene
of
his
labors
and
martyrdom
to
the
little
village
of
castine
for
in
father
thury
a
priest
of
the
diocese
of
quebec
a
man
of
tact
and
ability
had
gathered
about
him
a
band
of
converts
at
panawauski
on
the
penobscot
this
settlement
was
protected
by
the
baron
this
was
a
french
nobleman
and
a
soldier
who
originally
went
to
canada
in
command
of
a
regiment
the
regiment
was
disbanded
and
disappointed
ambition
and
a
heart
sore
from
domestic
trials
decided
him
rather
than
return
to
france
to
plunge
into
the
wilderness
and
there
far
from
kindred
and
nation
create
for
himself
a
new
home
after
a
while
the
baron
married
a
daughter
of
one
of
the
sachems
of
the
penobscot
indians
and
became
himself
a
sagamore
of
the

of
this
marriage

appointed
governor
of
new
england
and
in
the
following
year
sailing
eastward
in
the
frigate
he
anchored
opposite
the
little
fort
and
primitive
home
of
the
baron
retreated
with
the
small
band
of
settlers
to
the
woods
andros
being
a
catholic
touched
nothing
in
the
chapel
but
carried
off
everything
else
in
the
village
in
the
war
known
as
queen
war
broke
out
again
was
attacked
by
the
english
and
his
wife
and
children
carried
off
as
prisoners
but
were
soon
after
exchanged
from
this
time
the
name
of
baron
appears
in
all
the
annals
of
the
time
as
the
courageous
defender
of
his
faith
and
of
its
priests
father
râle
at
norridgewock
turned
to
him
for
counsel
and
aid
and
never
turned
in
vain
from
castine
on
to
mt
desert
the
shores
are
full
of
historical
interest
for
there
were
many
french
settlements
thereabouts
the
attention
of
that
nation
having
been
drawn
to
that
especial
locality
by
a
grant
of
land
which
cardillac
obtained
of
louis
xiv
in
april
this
grant
was
evidently
made
to
confirm
possession
a
certain
mme
de
grégoire
proved
herself
to
be
a
lineal
descendant
of
cardillac
and
in
acquired
a
partial
confirmation
of
the
original
grant
relics
of
the
french
settlers
are
constantly
turned
up
by
the
plough
in
the
vicinity
of
castine
and
in
a
quantity
of
french
gold
pieces
were
found
but
of
infinitely
more
interest
was
the
discovery
there
in
of
a
copper
plate
ten
inches
in
length
and
eight
in
width
the
finder
knowing
nothing
of
the
value
of
this
piece
of
metal
cut
off
a
portion
to
repair
his
boat
this
fragment
was
however
subsequently
recovered
the
letters
on
the
plate
are
unquestionably
abbreviations
of
the
following
inscription
junii

laid
this
foundation
in
honor
of
our
lady
of
holy
hope
in
regard
to
this
father
leo
the
most
diligent
research
fails
to
find
any
other
trace
the
plate
however
was
without
doubt
placed
in
the
foundation
of
a
catholic
chapel
probably
the
one
within
the
walls
of
the
old
french
fort
father
sebastian
râle
sailed
in
for
america
after
remaining
for
nearly
two
years
in
quebec
he
went
thence
to
norridgewock
he
found
the
abnakis
nearly
all
converted
and
at
once
applied
himself
to
learning
their
dialect
to
this
work
he
brought
his
marvellous
patience
and
energy
and
all
his
wondrous
insight
into
human
nature
he
began
his
dictionary
and
erected
a
chapel
on
the
spot
known
now
as
indian
old
point
this
chapel
he
supplied
with
all
the
decorations
calculated
to
engage
the
imagination
and
fix
the
wandering
attention
of
the
untutored
savage
the
women
contended
with
holy
emulation
in
the
embellishment
of
the
sanctuary
they
made
mats
of
the
soft
and
plumage
of
the
forest
birds
and
of
the
they
brought
offerings
of
huge
candles
manufactured
from
the
fragrant
wax
of
the
with
which
the
chapel
was
illuminated
a
couple
of
nuns
from
montreal
made
a
brief
sojourn
at
norridgewock
that
they
might
teach
the
indian
women
to
sew
and
to
make
a
kind
of
lace
with
which
to
adorn
the
altar
busied
with
his
dictionary
and
with
his
flock
father
râle
thus
passed
the
most
peaceful
days
of
his
life
but
this
blessed
quiet
ended
only
too
soon
in
a
party
of
english
under
the
command
of
a
capt
hilton
burst
from
out
the
forest
attacking
the
little
village
from
all
sides
at
once
finishing
by
burning
the
chapel
and
every
hut
about
the
same
time
the
of
new
england
sent
to
the
lower
part
of
the
kennebec
the
ablest
of
the
boston
divines
to
instruct
the
indian
children
as
the
missionary
salary
depended
on
his
success
he
neglected
no
means
that
could
attract
for
two
months
he
labored
in
vain
his
caresses
and
little
gifts
were
thrown
away
for
he
made
not
one
convert
father
râle
wrote
to
baxter
that
his
neophytes
were
good
christians
but
far
from
able
in
disputes
this
same
letter
which
was
of
some
length
challenged
the
protestant
clergyman
to
a
discussion
baxter
after
a
long
delay
sent
a
brief
reply
in
latin
so
bad
that
the
learned
priest
says
it
was
impossible
to
understand
it
in
the
indian
chiefs
held
a
council
the
governor
of
new
england
offered
them
an
english
and
an
indian
bible
and
baxter
as
their
expounder
the
abnakis
refused
them
one
and
all
and
elected
to
adhere
to
their
catholic
faith
saying
people
love
their
own
priests
your
bibles
we
do
not
care
for
and
god
has
already
sent
us
thus
years
passed
on
in
monotonous
labor
the
only
relaxation
permitted
to
himself
by
father
râle
was
the
work
on
his
dictionary
the
converts
venerated
their
priest
their
keen
eyes
and
quick
instincts
saw
the
sincerity
of
his
life
the
reality
of
his
affection
for
them
and
recognized
his
and
generosity
they
went
to
him
with
their
cares
and
their
sorrows
with
their
simple
griefs
and
simpler
pleasures
he
listened
with
unaffected
sympathy
and
interest
no
envious
rival
no
jealous
competitor
no
heretical
teacher
disturbed
the
relations
between
pastor
and
flock
so
too
was
it
but
natural
that
they
should
look
to
him
for
advice
when
they
gathered
about
their
the
wrongs
which
the
eastern
indians
were
constantly
enduring
at
the
hands
of
the
english
settlers
kindled
to
a
living
flame
the
smouldering
hatred
in
their
hearts
which
they
sought
every
opportunity
of
wreaking
in
vengeance
on
their
foe
thus
like
lightning
on
the
edge
of
the
horizon
they
hovered
on
the
frontier
making
daring
forays
on
the
farms
of
the
settlers
it
was
not
unnatural
that
the
english
bristling
with
prejudices
against
the
french
and
still
more
against
catholics
should
have
seen
fit
to
look
on
father
râle
as
the
instigator
of
all
these
attacks
forgetting
what
is
undeniably
true
that
father
converts
were
milder
and
kinder
and
more
than
any
of
their
indian
neighbors
the
good
father
was
full
of
concern
when
he
heard
that
a
fierce
and
warlike
tribe
who
had
steadily
resisted
all
elevating
influences
were
about
settling
within
a
journey
of
norridgewock
he
feared
lest
his
children
should
be
led
away
by
pernicious
examples
so
he
with
difficulty
persuaded
some
of
the
strangers
to
enter
the
chapel
and
to
be
present
at
some
of
the
imposing
ceremonies
of
the
mother
church
at
the
close
of
the
service
he
addressed
them
in
simple
words
and
thus
concluded
us
not
separate
that
some
may
go
one
way
and
some
another
let
us
all
go
to
heaven
it
is
our
country
and
the
place
to
which
we
are
invited
by
the
sole
master
of
life
of
whom
i
am
but
the
the
reply
of
the
indians
was
evasive
but
it
was
evident
that
an
impression
was
made
and
in
the
autumn
they
sent
to
him
to
say
that
if
he
would
come
to
them
they
would
receive
his
teachings
father
râle
gladly
went
at
this
bidding
erected
a
cross
and
a
chapel
and
finally
baptized
nearly
the
whole
tribe
at
this
time
father
râle
wrote
to
his
nephew
a
letter
in
which
he
says
new
church
is
neat
and
its
vestments
chasubles
copes
and
holy
vessels
would
be
esteemed
highly
appropriate
in
almost
any
church
in
europe
a
choir
of
young
indians
forty
in
number
assist
at
the
holy
sacrifice
of
the
mass
and
chant
the
divine
offices
for
the
consecration
of
the
holy
sacrament
and
you
would
be
edified
by
the
beautiful
order
they
preserve
and
the
devotion
they
manifest
after
the
mass
i
teach
the
young
children
and
the
remainder
of
the
morning
is
devoted
to
seeing
those
who
come
to
consult
me
on
affairs
of
importance
thus
you
see
i
teach
some
console
others
seek
to
peace
in
families
at
variance
and
to
calm
troubled
another
letter
still
later
in
speaking
of
the
attachment
of
the
converts
to
their
faith
says
when
they
go
to
the
in
summer
to
fish
i
accompany
them
and
when
they
reach
the
place
where
they
intend
to
pass
the
night
they
erect
stakes
at
intervals
in
the
form
of
a
chapel
and
spread
a
tent
made
of
ticking
all
is
complete
in
fifteen
minutes
i
always
carry
with
me
a
beautiful
board
of
cedar
with
the
necessary
supports
this
serves
for
an
altar
and
i
ornament
the
interior
with
silken
hangings
a
huge
serves
as
a
carpet
and
divine
service
is
held
within
an
while
away
on
one
of
the
excursions
which
father
râle
thus
describes
the
village
was
attacked
by
the
english
and
again
in
by
a
party
of
two
hundred
under
westbrook
new
england
had
passed
a
law
imposing
imprisonment
for
life
on
catholic
priests
and
a
reward
was
offered
for
the
head
of
father
râle
the
party
was
seen
as
they
entered
the
valley
of
the
kennebec
by
two
braves
who
hurried
on
to
give
the
alarm
the
priest
having
barely
time
to
escape
to
the
woods
with
the
altar
vessels
and
vestments
leaving
behind
him
all
his
papers
and
his
precious
abnaki
dictionary
which
was
enclosed
in
a
strong
box
of
peculiar
construction
it
had
two
rude
pictures
on
the
lid
one
of
the
scourging
of
our
blessed
lord
and
the
other
of
the
crowning
of
thorns
this
box
is
now
in
the
possession
of
the
massachusetts
historical
society
while
the
dictionary
itself
is
at
harvard
father
râle
saved
himself
by
taking
refuge
in
a
hollow
tree
where
he
remained
for
hours
suffering
from
hunger
and
a
broken
leg
with
wonderful
courage
father
râle
built
up
another
chapel
and
writes
thus
after
recounting
the
efforts
of
the
english
to
take
him
prisoner
the
words
of
the
apostle
i
conclude
i
do
not
fear
the
threats
of
those
who
hate
me
without
a
cause
and
i
count
not
my
life
dear
unto
myself
so
that
i
might
finish
my
course
and
the
ministry
which
i
have
received
of
the
lord
again
over
the
the
indian
chiefs
assembled
they
decided
to
send
an
embassy
to
boston
to
demand
that
their
chapel
which
had
been
destroyed
by
the
english
should
be
rebuilt
the
governor
anxious
to
secure
the
alliance
of
the
tribe
listened
patiently
and
told
them
in
reply
that
it
belonged
properly
to
the
governor
of
canada
to
rebuild
their
church
still
that
he
would
do
it
provided
they
would
agree
to
receive
the
clergy
he
would
choose
and
would
send
back
to
quebec
the
french
priest
who
was
then
with
them
we
can
not
forbear
repeating
here
the
unequalled
satire
of
the
reply
you
came
here
answered
the
chief
were
unknown
to
the
french
governor
but
no
one
of
you
spoke
of
prayer
or
of
the
great
spirit
you
thought
only
of
my
skins
and
furs
but
one
day
i
met
a
french
in
the
forest
he
did
not
look
at
the
skins
with
which
i
was
loaded
but
he
said
words
to
me
of
the
great
spirit
of
paradise
and
of
hell
and
of
prayer
by
which
is
the
only
path
to
heaven
listened
with
pleasure
and
at
last
begged
him
to
teach
and
to
baptize
me
when
you
saw
me
you
had
spoken
to
me
of
prayer
i
should
have
had
the
misfortune
to
pray
as
you
do
for
i
was
not
then
able
to
know
if
your
prayers
were
good
so
i
tell
you
i
will
hold
fast
to
the
prayers
of
the
french
i
will
keep
them
until
the
earth
burn
up
and
at
last
the
final
and
fatal
effort
on
the
life
of
father
râle
was
made
in
all
was
quiet
in
the
little
village
the
tall
corn
lay
yellow
in
the
slanting
rays
of
an
august
sun
when
suddenly
from
the
adjacent
woods
burst
forth
a
band
of
english
with
their
mohawk
allies
the
devoted
priest
knowing
that
they
were
in
hot
pursuit
of
him
sallied
forth
to
meet
them
hoping
by
the
sacrifice
of
his
own
life
to
save
his
flock
hardly
had
he
reached
the
mission
cross
in
the
centre
of
the
village
than
he
fell
at
its
foot
pierced
by
a
dozen
bullets
seven
indians
who
had
sought
to
shield
him
with
their
bodies
lay
dead
beside
him
then
followed
a
scene
that
beggars
description
women
and
children
were
killed
indiscriminately
and
it
ill
became
those
who
shot
women
as
they
swam
across
the
river
to
bring
a
charge
of
cruelty
against
the
french
fathers
the
chapel
was
robbed
and
then
fired
the
bell
was
not
melted
but
was
probably
afterward
buried
by
the
indians
for
it
was
revealed
only
a
few
years
since
by
the
blowing
down
of
a
huge
and
was
presented
to
bowdoin
college
the
soft
dewy
night
closed
on
the
scene
of
devastation
and
in
the
morning
as
one
by
one
the
survivors
crept
back
to
their
ruined
homes
with
their
hearts
full
of
consternation
and
sorrow
they
found
the
body
of
their
beloved
priest
not
only
pierced
by
a
hundred
balls
but
with
the
skull
crushed
by
hatchets
arms
and
legs
broken
and
mouth
and
eyes
filled
with
dirt
they
buried
him
where
the
day
before
had
stood
the
altar
of
the
little
chapel
and
sent
his
tattered
habits
to
quebec
it
was
by
so
precious
a
death
that
this
apostolical
man
closed
a
career
of
nearly
forty
years
of
painful
missionary
toil
his
fasts
and
vigils
had
greatly
enfeebled
his
constitution
and
when
entreated
to
take
precautions
for
his
safety
he
answered
measures
are
taken
god
has
committed
this
flock
to
my
charge
and
i
will
share
their
fate
being
too
happy
if
permitted
to
sacrifice
myself
for
well
did
his
superior
in
canada
de
bellemont
reply
when
requested
to
offer
masses
for
his
soul
the
words
of
augustine
i
say
it
would
be
wronging
a
martyr
to
pray
for
there
can
be
no
question
that
sebastian
râle
was
one
of
the
most
remarkable
men
of
his
day
a
devoted
christian
and
finished
scholar
commanding
in
manners
and
elegant
in
address
of
persuasive
eloquence
and
great
administrative
ability
he
courted
death
and
starvation
for
the
sole
end
of
salvation
for
the
indian
from
the
death
of
father
râle
until
the
mission
at
norridgewock
was
without
a
priest
in
that
year
however
the
superior
at
quebec
sent
father
james
de
sirenne
to
that
station
the
account
given
by
this
father
of
the
warmth
with
which
he
was
received
and
of
the
manner
in
which
the
indians
had
sought
to
keep
their
faith
is
very
touching
the
women
with
tears
and
sobs
hastened
with
their
unbaptized
babes
to
the
priest
in
all
these
years
no
protestant
clergyman
had
visited
them
for
eliot
was
almost
the
only
one
who
devoted
himself
to
the
conversion
of
the
indians
though
even
he
as
affirmed
by
bancroft
had
never
approached
the
indian
tribe
that
dwelt
within
six
miles
of
boston
harbor
until
five
years
after
the
cross
had
been
borne
by
the
religious
zeal
of
the
french
from
lake
superior
to
the
valley
of
the
mississippi
but
father
sirenne
could
not
be
permitted
to
remain
any
length
of
time
with
the
abnakis
again
were
they
deserted
having
a
priest
with
them
only
at
long
intervals
then
came
the
peace
of
in
which
france
surrendered
canada
this
step
struck
a
most
terrible
blow
at
the
missions
for
although
the
english
government
guaranteed
to
the
canadians
absolute
religious
freedom
they
yet
took
quiet
steps
to
rid
themselves
of
the
jesuit
fathers
a
short
breathing
space
and
another
war
swept
over
the
land
and
with
this
perished
the
last
mission
in
maine
in
deputies
from
the
various
tribes
in
maine
and
nova
scotia
met
the
massachusetts
council
the
indians
announced
their
intention
of
adhering
to
the
americans
but
begged
at
the
same
time
for
a
french
priest
the
council
expressed
their
regret
at
not
being
able
to
find
one
indeed
was
it
says
shea
the
very
body
which
less
than
a
century
before
had
made
it
felony
for
a
catholic
priest
to
visit
the
abnakis
now
regretted
their
inability
to
send
these
christian
indians
a
missionary
of
the
same
faith
and
years
after
when
peace
was
declared
and
the
few
catholics
in
maryland
had
chosen
the
rev
john
carroll
a
member
of
the
proscribed
society
of
jesus
as
bishop
the
abnakis
of
maine
sent
a
deputation
bearing
the
crucifix
of
father
râle
this
they
presented
to
the
bishop
with
earnest
supplications
for
a
priest
bishop
carroll
promised
that
one
should
be
sent
and
father
ciquard
was
speedily
despatched
to
norridgewock
where
he
remained
for
ten
years
then
ensued
another
interval
during
which
the
flock
was
without
a
shepherd
at
last
a
missionary
priest
at
boston
father
afterward
cardinal
cheverus
turned
his
attention
to
the
study
of
the
abnaki
dialect
and
then
visited
the
penobscot
tribe
desolate
poor
and
forsaken
as
they
had
been
the
indians
still
clung
to
their
faith
the
old
taught
the
young
and
all
gathered
on
sundays
to
chant
the
music
of
the
mass
and
vespers
though
their
altar
had
no
priest
and
no
sacrifice
father
cheverus
after
a
few
months
was
succeeded
by
father
romagné
who
for
twenty
years
consecrated
every
moment
and
every
thought
to
the
evangelization
of
the
penobscot
and
passamaquoddy
tribes
in
july
bishop
fenwick
visited
this
portion
of
his
diocese
and
in
sent
them
a
resident
missionary
a
beautiful
church
stood
at
last
in
the
place
of
hut
and
two
years
later
bishop
fenwick
once
a
father
in
the
society
of
jesus
erected
a
monument
to
father
râle
on
the
spot
where
he
was
slain
a
hundred
and
nine
years
before
from
far
and
near
gathered
the
crowd
protestant
as
well
as
catholic
to
witness
the
ceremony
the
monument
stands
in
a
green
secluded
spot
a
simple
shaft
of
granite
surmounted
by
a
cross
and
an
inscription
in
latin
tells
the
traveller
that
there
died
a
faithful
priest
and
servant
of
the
lord
bishop
fenwick
became
extremely
anxious
to
induce
some
french
priest
to
go
to
that
ancient
mission
and
a
year
later
the
society
of
picpus
in
switzerland
sent
out
fathers
demilier
and
petithomme
to
restore
the
franciscan
missions
in
maine
they
conquered
the
difficulties
of
the
abnaki
dialect
with
the
aid
of
a
which
the
bishop
had
caused
to
be
printed
and
in
this
small
and
insignificant
mission
father
demilier
toiled
until
his
death
in
the
successor
of
bishop
fenwick
resolved
to
restore
the
abnaki
mission
to
the
fathers
of
the
society
of
jesus
by
whom
it
had
been
originally
founded
therefore
since
the
penobscots
and
passamaquoddys
have
been
under
the
care
of
the
jesuits
who
in
that
year
sent
out
from
switzerland
father
john
bapst
to
old
town
on
the
penobscot
a
short
distance
from
bangor
where
he
ministered
faithfully
to
the
abnakis
until
he
nearly
lost
his
life
in
a
disgraceful
riot
in
as
we
find
ourselves
thus
at
the
conclusion
of
our
narration
incidents
crowd
upon
our
memory
of
the
wondrous
sacrifices
made
by
the
catholic
clergy
in
the
old
missions
of
maine
but
we
are
admonished
that
our
space
is
limited
little
attention
however
has
been
paid
to
the
fact
that
to
these
catholic
priests
alone
under
god
is
due
the
evangelization
of
the
many
indian
tribes
which
formerly
haunted
our
grand
old
forests
of
these
tribes
only
a
few
of
the
penobscots
are
left
and
these
cling
still
to
the
cross
as
the
blessed
symbol
of
the
faith
first
brought
to
them
a
voice
crying
in
the
wilderness
by
fathers
biard
and
du
thet
at
sauveur
in
prussia
and
the
church
the
first
attempts
to
introduce
the
christian
religion
into
prussia
were
unsuccessful
adalbert
in
and
bruno
in
suffered
martyrdom
whilst
preaching
the
gospel
there
and
the
efforts
of
poland
to
force
the
conquered
prussians
to
receive
the
faith
only
increased
the
bitterness
of
their
prejudices
early
in
the
xiith
century
bishop
otto
of
bamberg
made
many
conversions
in
pomerania
and
finally
in
the
beginning
of
the
xiiith
the
cistercian
monk
christian
with
the
approval
and
encouragement
of
pope
innocent
set
to
work
to
convert
the
prussians
and
met
with
such
success
that
in
he
was
made
bishop
of
the
country
the
greater
part
of
the
people
however
still
remained
heathens
and
the
progress
of
christianity
aroused
in
them
such
indignation
that
they
determined
to
oppose
its
farther
advance
with
the
sword
to
protect
his
flock
bishop
christian
called
to
his
aid
the
knights
of
the
teutonic
order
in
furtherance
of
his
designs
the
emperor
frederic
ii
turned
the
whole
country
over
to
them
and
pope
gregory
ix
took
measures
to
increase
their
number
so
that
they
might
be
able
to
hold
possession
of
this
field
now
first
opened
to
the
gospel
pope
innocent
iv
also
manifested
special
interest
in
the
welfare
of
the
church
in
prussia
he
urged
priests
and
monks
to
devote
themselves
to
this
mission
supported
and
encouraged
the
bishops
in
their
trials
and
difficulties
and
exhorted
the
convents
throughout
germany
to
contribute
books
for
the
education
of
the
people
but
circumstances
were
not
wanting
which
made
the
position
of
the
church
in
prussia
very
unsatisfactory
the
people
had
for
the
most
part
been
brought
under
the
influence
by
the
power
of
arms
and
consequently
to
a
great
extent
remained
strangers
to
her
true
spirit
the
teutonic
order
moreover
gave
ecclesiastical
positions
only
to
german
priests
so
as
to
hold
out
inducements
to
the
people
to
learn
german
though
as
a
consequence
the
priests
were
unable
to
communicate
with
their
flocks
except
by
the
aid
of
interpreters
the
grand
master
too
had
almost
unlimited
control
over
the
election
of
bishops
which
was
the
cause
of
many
evils
especially
as
the
order
gradually
grew
lax
in
the
observance
of
the
rule
and
lost
much
of
its
christian
character
unworthy
men
were
thrust
into
ecclesiastical
offices
the
standard
of
morality
among
the
clergy
was
lowered
and
the
people
lost
respect
for
the
priesthood
it
is
not
surprising
in
view
of
all
this
that
the
religious
sectaries
of
the
xiiith
and
xivth
centuries
should
have
found
favor
in
prussia
and
made
converts
among
her
still
populations
in
the
teutonic
order
became
a
dependency
of
the
crown
of
poland
there
was
no
hope
of
its
freeing
itself
from
this
humiliating
subjection
without
foreign
aid
and
with
a
view
to
obtain
this
the
knights
resolved
to
choose
their
grand
master
from
one
or
other
of
the
most
powerful
german
families
first
in
they
elected
frederic
duke
of
saxony
and
upon
his
death
in
albrecht
margrave
of
brandenburg
was
chosen
to
succeed
him
albrecht
refused
the
oath
of
supremacy
to
sigismund
king
of
poland
who
thereupon
in
declared
war
upon
him
to
meet
the
expenses
of
the
war
albrecht
had
the
sacred
vessels
of
the
church
melted
down
and
minted
but
he
was
unable
to
stand
against
the
arms
of
poland
and
therefore
sought
the
mediation
of
the
emperor
of
germany
through
whose
good
offices
he
was
able
to
conclude
in
a
four
truce
he
now
went
into
germany
where
luther
was
already
preaching
the
protestant
rebellion
and
asked
aid
from
the
imperial
parliament
which
was
holding
its
sessions
at
nuremberg
and
as
this
was
denied
him
he
turned
with
favor
to
the
teachers
of
the
new
doctrines
the
teutonic
order
had
become
thoroughly
corrupt
and
leo
urged
albrecht
to
begin
a
reformation
capite
et
but
the
grand
master
sought
the
advice
of
luther
from
whom
he
received
the
not
unwelcome
counsel
to
throw
away
the
unnatural
rule
of
his
order
take
a
wife
and
turn
prussia
into
a
temporal
hereditary
albrecht
accordingly
asked
for
preachers
of
the
new
doctrines
and
in
announced
his
abandonment
of
the
order
and
the
catholic
church
by
his
marriage
with
the
daughter
of
the
king
of
denmark
acting
upon
the
protestant
principle
regio
illius
the
ruler
of
the
land
makes
its
religion
he
forced
the
prussians
to
quit
the
church
from
which
they
had
received
whatever
culture
and
civilization
they
had
at
his
death
in
lutheranism
had
gained
complete
possession
of
the
country
a
few
catholics
however
remained
for
whom
early
in
the
xviith
century
king
sigismund
of
poland
succeeded
in
obtaining
liberty
of
conscience
which
however
was
denied
to
those
of
brandenburg
frederic
william
the
second
king
of
prussia
and
the
first
to
form
the
design
of
placing
her
among
the
great
powers
of
europe
by
the
aid
of
a
strong
military
organization
in
giving
directions
in
for
the
education
of
his
son
afterwards
frederic
the
great
insisted
that
the
boy
should
be
inspired
with
a
horror
of
the
catholic
church
groundlessness
and
absurdity
of
whose
teachings
should
be
placed
before
his
eyes
and
well
impressed
upon
his
frederic
william
was
a
rigid
calvinist
and
if
he
tolerated
a
few
catholics
in
his
dominions
it
was
only
that
he
might
vent
his
or
exercise
his
proselytizing
zeal
upon
them
he
indeed
granted
father
raymundus
bruns
permission
to
say
mass
in
the
garrisons
at
berlin
and
potsdam
but
only
after
he
had
been
assured
that
it
would
tend
to
prevent
desertions
among
his
catholic
soldiers
and
that
as
raymundus
was
a
monk
bound
by
a
vow
of
poverty
he
would
ask
no
pay
from
his
majesty
in
permission
was
granted
the
catholics
to
hold
public
worship
in
berlin
and
the
church
was
built
in
pomerania
however
this
privilege
was
denied
them
except
in
the
polish
districts
during
the
xviiith
century
congregations
were
formed
at
stettin
and
stralsund
in
the
principality
of
halberstadt
the
catholics
were
allowed
to
retain
possession
of
a
church
and
several
monasteries
in
which
public
worship
was
permitted
and
in
what
had
been
the
archbishopric
of
magdeburg
there
were
left
to
them
one
benedictine
monastery
and
four
convents
of
cistercian
nuns
these
latter
however
were
placed
under
the
supervision
of
protestant
ministers
frederic
the
great
early
in
life
fell
under
the
influence
of
voltaire
and
his
disciples
from
whom
he
learned
to
despise
all
religion
and
especially
the
rigid
calvinism
of
his
father
he
became
a
religious
sceptic
and
satisfied
with
his
contempt
for
all
forms
of
faith
did
not
take
the
trouble
to
persecute
any
he
asked
of
his
subjects
whether
protestant
or
catholic
nothing
but
money
and
recruits
for
the
rest
he
allowed
every
one
in
his
dominions
save
his
soul
after
his
own
he
provided
chaplains
for
his
catholic
soldiers
and
forbade
the
calvinist
and
lutheran
ministers
to
interfere
with
their
religious
freedom
for
reasons
similar
to
those
which
had
induced
his
father
to
permit
raymundus
bruns
to
say
mass
in
the
garrison
at
berlin
he
had
certainly
no
thought
of
showing
any
favor
to
the
church
except
so
far
as
it
might
promote
his
own
ambitious
projects
his
great
need
of
soldiers
made
him
throw
every
obstacle
in
the
way
of
those
who
wished
to
enter
the
priesthood
and
his
fear
of
foreign
influence
caused
him
to
forbid
priests
to
leave
the
country
his
mistrust
of
priests
was
so
great
that
he
gave
instructions
to
count
hoym
his
minister
of
state
to
place
them
under
a
system
of
espionage
catholics
were
carefully
excluded
from
all
influential
and
lucrative
positions
they
were
taxed
more
heavily
than
protestants
and
professors
in
the
universities
were
required
to
take
an
oath
to
uphold
the
reformation
notwithstanding
it
was
in
the
reign
of
frederic
the
great
that
the
catholic
church
in
prussia
may
be
said
to
have
entered
upon
a
new
life
for
more
than
two
hundred
years
it
had
had
no
recognized
status
there
but
through
the
conquest
of
silesia
and
the
division
of
poland
a
large
catholic
population
was
incorporated
into
the
kingdom
of
prussia
and
thus
a
new
element
which
was
formally
recognized
in
the
constitution
promulgated
by
immediate
successor
was
introduced
into
the
prussian
state
together
with
the
toleration
of
all
who
believed
in
god
and
were
loyal
to
the
king
the
law
of
the
land
placed
the
catholic
and
protestant
churches
on
an
equal
footing
to
understand
how
far
this
was
favorable
to
the
church
we
must
go
back
and
consider
the
relations
of
prussia
to
protestantism
what
is
known
as
the
territorial
system
by
which
the
faith
of
the
people
is
delivered
into
the
hands
of
the
temporal
ruler
has
existed
in
prussia
from
the
time
albrecht
of
brandenburg
went
over
to
the
reformers
protestantism
and
absolutism
triumphed
simultaneously
throughout
europe
and
this
must
undoubtedly
be
in
a
great
measure
attributed
to
the
fact
that
the
protestants
whether
willingly
or
not
yielded
up
their
faith
into
the
keeping
of
kings
and
princes
and
thus
practically
abandoned
the
distinction
of
the
spiritual
and
temporal
powers
which
lies
at
the
foundation
of
christian
civilization
and
is
also
the
strongest
bulwark
against
the
encroachments
of
governments
upon
the
rights
of
citizens
duke
albrecht
had
hardly
become
a
protestant
when
he
felt
that
it
was
his
duty
are
his
words
to
take
upon
himself
the
episcopal
office
this
was
in
in
he
treated
the
urgent
request
of
the
assembly
to
have
the
bishopric
of
samland
restored
as
an
attack
upon
his
princely
prerogative
his
successor
diverted
to
other
uses
the
fund
destined
for
the
maintenance
of
the
bishops
and
instituted
two
consistories
to
which
he
entrusted
the
ecclesiastical
affairs
of
the
duchy
during
the
xviith
century
calvinism
gained
a
firm
foothold
in
prussia
it
became
the
religion
of
the
ruling
family
and
frederic
william
called
the
great
elector
to
whose
policy
his
successors
have
agreed
to
ascribe
their
greatness
sought
in
every
way
to
promote
its
interests
though
he
strenuously
exercised
his
his
spiritual
supremacy
over
both
the
lutherans
and
the
calvinists
his
son
frederic
who
first
took
the
title
of
king
of
prussia
continued
the
policy
of
his
father
with
regard
to
ecclesiastical
affairs
us
alone
he
declared
to
the
landstand
the
supremum
the
highest
and
sovereign
right
in
ecclesiastical
the
lutherans
wished
to
retain
the
exorcism
as
a
part
of
the
ceremony
of
baptism
but
frederic
published
an
edict
by
which
he
forbade
the
appointment
of
any
minister
who
would
refuse
to
confer
the
sacrament
without
making
use
of
this
ceremony
in
the
same
way
he
meddled
with
the
lutheran
practice
of
auricular
confession
and
by
an
order
issued
in
prohibited
the
publication
of
theological
writings
which
had
not
received
his
imprimatur
his
successor
frederic
william
the
father
of
frederic
the
great
looked
upon
himself
as
the
absolute
and
irresponsible
master
of
the
subjects
whom
god
had
given
him
am
king
and
master
he
was
wont
to
say
can
do
what
i
he
was
a
rigid
calvinist
and
made
his
absolutism
felt
more
especially
in
religious
matters
it
seems
that
preachers
then
as
since
were
sometimes
in
the
habit
of
preaching
long
sermons
so
king
frederic
william
put
a
fine
of
two
thalers
upon
any
one
who
should
preach
longer
than
one
hour
he
required
his
preachers
to
insist
in
their
upon
the
duty
of
obedience
and
loyalty
to
the
king
and
the
government
officials
were
charged
to
report
any
failure
to
make
special
mention
of
this
duty
both
lutherans
and
calvinists
were
forbidden
to
touch
in
their
sermons
upon
any
points
controverted
between
the
two
confessions
no
detail
of
religious
worship
was
insignificant
enough
to
escape
his
meddlesome
tyranny
the
length
of
the
service
the
altar
the
vestments
of
the
minister
the
sign
of
the
cross
the
giving
or
singing
the
blessing
all
fell
under
his
episcopal
this
unlovely
old
king
was
followed
by
frederic
the
great
who
though
an
infidel
and
a
scoffer
held
as
firmly
as
his
father
to
his
sovereign
episcopal
prerogatives
and
who
if
less
meddlesome
was
not
less
arbitrary
and
now
we
have
got
back
to
the
constitution
which
after
silesia
and
a
part
of
poland
had
been
united
to
the
crown
of
prussia
was
partially
drawn
up
under
frederic
the
great
and
completed
and
promulgated
during
the
reign
of
his
successor
and
which
as
we
have
already
said
placed
the
three
principal
confessions
of
the
christian
faith
in
the
prussian
states
the
lutheran
the
reformed
and
the
catholic
on
a
footing
of
equality
before
the
law
now
it
must
be
noticed
this
constitution
left
intact
the
absolute
authority
of
the
king
over
the
reformed
and
lutheran
churches
and
therefore
what
might
seem
to
be
a
great
gain
for
the
catholic
church
was
really
none
at
all
since
it
was
simply
placed
under
the
supreme
jurisdiction
of
the
king
there
was
no
express
recognition
of
the
organic
union
of
the
church
in
prussia
with
the
pope
nor
of
the
right
of
the
bishops
to
govern
their
dioceses
according
to
the
ecclesiastical
canons
but
rather
the
tacit
assumption
that
the
king
was
head
of
the
catholic
as
of
the
protestant
churches
in
prussia
the
constitution
was
drawn
up
by
suarez
a
bitter
enemy
of
the
church
and
in
many
of
its
details
was
characterized
by
an
spirit
it
annulled
for
instance
the
contract
made
by
parents
of
different
faith
concerning
the
religious
education
of
their
children
and
manifested
in
many
other
ways
that
petty
and
tyrannical
spirit
which
has
led
prussia
to
interfere
habitually
with
the
internal
discipline
and
working
of
the
church
as
the
catholic
population
of
prussia
increased
through
the
annexation
of
different
german
states
this
constitution
which
gave
the
king
supreme
control
of
spiritual
matters
was
extended
to
the
territories
thus
all
through
the
xviiith
century
the
church
in
prussia
though
not
openly
persecuted
was
fettered
no
progress
was
made
abuses
could
not
be
reformed
the
appointment
of
bishops
was
not
free
the
training
of
the
priesthood
was
very
imperfect
and
it
is
not
surprising
that
this
slavery
should
have
been
productive
of
many
and
serious
evils
the
french
revolution
and
the
wars
of
napoleon
which
caused
social
and
political
upheavals
throughout
europe
toppled
down
thrones
overthrew
empires
and
broke
up
and
reformed
the
boundaries
of
nations
mark
a
new
epoch
in
the
history
of
prussia
and
indeed
of
all
germany
whose
people
had
been
taught
by
these
disastrous
wars
that
they
had
common
interests
which
could
not
be
protected
without
national
unity
the
want
of
which
had
never
before
been
made
so
painfully
manifest
after
the
downfall
of
napoleon
the
ambassadors
of
the
allied
powers
met
in
vienna
to
settle
the
affairs
of
all
europe
nations
provinces
and
cities
were
given
away
in
the
most
reckless
manner
without
any
thought
of
the
interests
or
wishes
of
the
people
to
the
kings
and
rulers
who
could
command
the
greatest
influence
in
the
congress
or
whose
displeasure
was
most
feared
germany
demanded
the
restoration
of
alsace
and
lorraine
but
was
thwarted
in
her
designs
by
great
britain
and
russia
who
feared
the
restoration
of
her
ancient
power
prussia
received
from
the
congress
as
some
compensation
for
its
sufferings
and
sacrifices
during
the
napoleonic
wars
the
duchies
of
jülich
and
berg
the
former
possessions
of
the
episcopal
sees
of
cologne
and
treves
and
several
other
territories
which
were
formed
into
the
rhine
province
on
the
other
hand
it
lost
a
portion
of
the
sclavonic
population
which
it
had
held
on
the
east
so
that
though
it
gained
nothing
in
territory
it
became
more
strictly
a
german
state
and
was
consequently
better
fitted
gradually
to
take
the
lead
in
the
irrepressible
movement
toward
the
unification
of
germany
in
the
congress
of
vienna
it
was
stipulated
that
catholics
and
protestants
should
have
equal
rights
before
the
law
the
constitutional
law
of
prussia
was
extended
to
the
provinces
and
ecclesiastical
matters
whether
of
roman
catholics
or
of
protestants
together
with
the
supervision
and
administration
of
all
charitable
funds
the
confirming
of
all
persons
appointed
to
spiritual
offices
and
the
supervision
over
the
administration
of
ecclesiastics
as
far
as
it
may
have
any
relation
to
civil
affairs
were
reserved
to
the
in
upon
the
occasion
of
the
reorganization
of
the
government
we
perceive
to
what
practical
purposes
these
principles
were
to
be
applied
the
church
was
debased
to
a
function
of
the
state
her
interests
were
placed
in
the
hands
of
the
ministry
for
spiritual
affairs
and
the
education
of
even
clerical
students
was
put
under
the
control
of
government
it
was
in
this
same
year
that
the
tercentennial
anniversary
of
the
birth
of
protestantism
was
celebrated
for
two
centuries
protestant
faith
in
germany
had
been
dying
out
eager
and
bitter
controversies
the
religious
wars
and
the
plunder
of
church
property
during
the
xvith
and
early
part
of
the
xviith
centuries
had
given
it
an
unnatural
and
artificial
vigor
it
was
a
mighty
and
radical
revolution
social
political
and
religious
and
therefore
gave
birth
to
fanaticism
and
intense
partisan
zeal
and
was
in
turn
helped
on
by
them
there
is
a
natural
strength
in
a
new
faith
and
when
it
is
tried
by
war
and
persecution
it
seems
to
rise
to
a
divine
power
protestantism
burst
upon
europe
with
irresistible
force
fifty
years
had
not
passed
since
luther
had
burned
the
bull
of
pope
leo
and
the
catholic
church
beaten
almost
everywhere
in
the
north
of
europe
seemed
hardly
able
to
hold
her
own
on
the
shores
of
the
mediterranean
fifty
years
later
and
protestantism
was
saved
in
germany
itself
only
by
the
arms
of
catholic
france
the
peace
of
westphalia
in
put
an
end
to
the
religious
wars
of
germany
and
from
that
date
the
decay
of
the
protestant
faith
was
rapid
many
causes
helped
on
the
work
of
ruin
the
inherent
weakness
of
the
protestant
system
from
its
purely
negative
character
the
growing
and
bitter
dissensions
among
protestants
the
hopeless
slavery
to
which
the
sects
had
been
reduced
by
the
civil
power
all
tended
to
undermine
faith
in
the
palatinate
within
a
period
of
sixty
years
the
rulers
had
forced
the
people
to
change
their
religion
four
times
in
prussia
whose
king
as
we
have
seen
was
supreme
head
of
the
church
the
ruling
house
till
was
catholic
then
till
lutheran
from
that
date
to
calvinistic
from
to
infidel
the
avowed
ally
of
voltaire
and
then
till
calvinistic
and
finally
again
evangelical
during
the
long
reign
of
frederic
the
great
unbelief
made
steady
progress
men
no
longer
attacked
this
or
that
article
of
faith
but
christianity
itself
the
quickest
way
it
was
openly
said
by
many
to
get
rid
of
superstition
and
would
be
to
abolish
preaching
altogether
and
thus
remove
the
ghost
of
religion
from
the
eyes
of
the
people
it
seems
strange
that
such
license
of
thought
and
expression
should
have
been
tolerated
and
even
encouraged
in
a
country
where
religion
itself
has
never
been
free
but
it
is
a
peculiarity
of
the
prussian
system
of
government
that
while
it
hampers
and
fetters
the
church
and
all
religious
organizations
it
leaves
the
widest
liberty
of
conscience
to
the
individual
its
policy
appears
to
be
to
foster
indifference
and
infidelity
in
order
to
use
them
against
what
it
considers
religious
fanaticism
another
circumstance
which
favored
infidelity
may
be
found
in
the
political
thraldom
in
which
prussia
held
her
people
as
men
were
forbidden
to
speak
or
write
on
subjects
relating
to
the
government
or
the
public
welfare
they
took
refuge
in
theological
and
philosophical
discussions
which
in
protestant
lands
have
never
failed
to
lead
to
unbelief
this
same
state
of
things
tended
to
promote
the
introduction
and
increase
of
secret
societies
which
in
the
latter
half
of
the
xviiith
century
sprang
up
in
great
numbers
throughout
germany
bearing
a
hundred
different
names
but
always
having
tendencies
to
stop
the
spread
of
infidelity
frederic
william
the
successor
of
frederic
the
great
issued
in
an
embracing
the
constitution
of
religion
in
the
prussian
the
king
declared
that
he
could
no
longer
suffer
in
his
dominions
that
men
should
openly
seek
to
undermine
religion
to
make
the
bible
ridiculous
in
the
eyes
of
the
people
and
to
raise
in
public
the
banner
of
unbelief
deism
and
naturalism
he
would
in
future
permit
no
farther
change
in
the
creed
whether
of
the
lutheran
or
the
reformed
church
this
was
the
more
necessary
as
he
had
himself
noticed
with
sorrow
years
before
he
ascended
the
throne
that
the
protestant
ministers
allowed
themselves
boundless
license
with
regard
to
the
articles
of
faith
and
indeed
altogether
rejected
several
essential
parts
and
fundamental
verities
of
the
protestant
church
and
the
christian
religion
they
blushed
not
to
revive
the
errors
of
the
socinians
the
deists
and
the
naturalists
and
to
scatter
them
among
the
people
under
the
false
name
of
enlightenment
whilst
they
treated
word
with
disdain
and
strove
to
throw
suspicion
upon
the
mysteries
of
revelation
since
this
was
intolerable
he
therefore
as
ruler
of
the
land
and
only
in
his
states
commanded
and
ordered
that
in
future
no
clergyman
preacher
or
of
the
protestant
religion
should
presume
under
pain
of
perpetual
loss
of
office
and
of
even
severer
punishment
to
disseminate
the
errors
already
named
for
as
it
was
his
duty
to
preserve
intact
the
law
of
the
land
so
was
it
incumbent
upon
him
to
see
that
religion
should
be
kept
free
from
taint
and
he
could
not
consequently
allow
its
ministers
to
substitute
their
whims
and
fancies
for
the
truths
of
christianity
they
must
teach
what
had
been
agreed
upon
in
the
symbols
of
faith
of
the
denomination
to
which
they
belonged
to
this
they
were
bound
by
their
office
and
the
contract
under
which
they
had
received
their
positions
nevertheless
out
of
his
great
love
for
freedom
of
conscience
the
king
was
willing
that
those
who
were
known
to
disbelieve
in
the
articles
of
faith
might
retain
their
offices
provided
they
consented
to
teach
their
flocks
what
they
were
themselves
unable
to
believe
in
this
royal
edict
we
have
at
once
the
fullest
confession
of
the
general
unbelief
that
was
destroying
protestantism
in
prussia
and
of
the
hopelessness
of
any
attempt
to
arrest
its
progress
what
could
be
more
pitiable
than
the
condition
of
a
church
powerless
to
control
its
ministers
and
publicly
recognizing
their
right
to
be
hypocrites
how
could
men
who
had
no
faith
teach
others
to
believe
moreover
what
could
be
more
absurd
from
a
protestant
point
of
view
than
to
seek
to
force
the
acceptance
of
symbols
of
faith
when
the
whole
reformation
rested
upon
the
assumed
right
of
the
individual
to
decide
for
himself
what
should
or
should
not
be
believed
or
was
it
to
be
supposed
that
men
could
invest
the
conflicting
creeds
of
the
sects
with
a
sacredness
which
they
had
denied
to
that
of
the
universal
church
it
is
not
surprising
therefore
that
the
only
effect
of
the
edict
should
have
been
to
increase
the
energy
and
activity
of
the
infidels
and
frederic
william
who
ascended
the
throne
in
recognizing
the
futility
of
his
attempt
to
keep
alive
faith
in
protestantism
stopped
the
enforcement
of
the
edict
with
the
express
declaration
that
its
effect
had
been
to
lessen
religion
and
increase
hypocrisy
abandoning
all
hope
of
controlling
the
faith
of
the
preachers
he
turned
his
attention
to
their
morals
a
decree
of
the
oberconsistorium
of
berlin
in
ordered
that
the
conduct
of
the
ministers
should
be
closely
watched
and
every
means
employed
to
stop
the
immorality
of
the
servants
of
the
church
which
was
having
the
most
injurious
effects
upon
their
congregations
parents
had
almost
ceased
having
their
children
baptized
or
had
them
christened
in
the
of
frederic
the
great
or
in
the
of
the
good
and
the
fair
sometimes
with
but
the
calamities
which
befell
germany
during
the
wars
of
the
french
revolution
and
the
empire
seemed
to
have
turned
the
thoughts
of
many
to
religion
the
frightful
humiliations
of
the
fatherland
were
looked
upon
as
a
visitation
from
heaven
upon
the
people
for
their
sins
and
unbelief
and
therefore
when
the
tercentennial
anniversary
of
protestantism
came
around
in
they
were
prepared
to
enter
upon
its
celebration
with
earnest
enthusiasm
the
celebration
took
the
form
of
an
demonstration
for
many
years
controversy
between
protestants
and
catholics
had
ceased
but
now
a
wholly
unprovoked
but
bitter
and
grossly
insulting
attack
was
made
upon
the
church
from
all
the
protestant
pulpits
of
germany
and
in
numberless
writings
the
result
of
this
wanton
aggression
was
a
reawakening
of
catholic
faith
and
life
whilst
the
attempt
to
take
advantage
of
the
protestant
enthusiasm
to
bring
about
a
union
between
the
lutheran
and
reformed
churches
in
prussia
ended
in
causing
fresh
dissensions
and
divisions
the
sect
of
the
old
lutherans
was
formed
which
in
spite
of
persecution
finally
succeeded
in
obtaining
toleration
though
not
till
many
of
its
adherents
had
been
driven
across
the
ocean
into
exile
as
the
congress
of
vienna
had
decided
that
catholics
and
protestants
should
be
placed
upon
a
footing
of
equality
and
as
prussia
had
received
a
large
portion
of
the
lands
of
the
church
with
the
stipulation
that
she
should
provide
for
the
maintenance
of
catholic
worship
the
government
in
sent
niebuhr
the
historian
to
rome
to
treat
with
the
pope
concerning
the
reorganization
of
the
catholic
religion
in
the
prussian
states
finally
in
an
agreement
was
signed
which
received
the
sanction
of
the
king
and
was
published
as
a
fundamental
law
of
the
state
in
this
concordat
with
the
holy
see
there
is
at
least
a
tacit
recognition
of
the
true
nature
of
the
church
of
her
organic
unity
a
beginning
of
respect
for
her
freedom
and
a
seeming
promise
of
a
better
future
in
point
of
fact
however
in
spite
of
assurance
to
the
holy
father
that
he
might
rely
upon
the
honest
intentions
of
the
government
prussia
began
almost
at
once
to
meddle
with
the
rights
of
catholics
a
silent
and
slow
persecution
was
inaugurated
by
which
it
was
hoped
their
patience
would
be
exhausted
and
their
strength
wasted
and
now
we
shall
examine
more
closely
the
artful
and
heartless
policy
by
which
with
but
slight
variations
for
more
than
two
centuries
prussia
has
sought
to
undermine
the
catholic
religion
in
the
protestants
of
all
communions
in
prussia
amounted
to
and
the
catholics
to
these
populations
are
to
only
a
very
limited
extent
intermingled
certain
provinces
being
almost
entirely
catholic
and
others
nearly
wholly
protestant
by
law
the
same
rights
are
granted
to
both
catholics
and
protestants
and
both
therefore
should
receive
like
treatment
at
the
hands
of
the
government
this
is
the
theory
what
are
the
facts
we
will
take
the
religious
policy
of
prussia
from
the
reorganization
of
the
church
after
the
congress
of
vienna
down
to
the
revolution
of
and
we
will
begin
with
the
subject
of
education
for
the
six
millions
of
protestants
there
were
four
exclusively
protestant
universities
at
berlin
halle
königsberg
and
greifswalde
for
the
four
millions
of
catholics
there
were
but
two
at
bonn
and
breslau
in
each
of
which
there
was
a
double
faculty
the
one
protestant
the
other
catholic
though
the
professors
in
all
the
faculties
except
that
of
theology
were
for
the
most
part
protestants
thus
out
of
six
universities
to
the
catholics
was
left
only
a
little
corner
in
two
though
they
were
forced
to
bear
nearly
of
the
public
burdens
by
which
all
six
were
supported
but
this
is
not
the
worst
the
bishops
had
no
voice
in
the
nomination
of
the
professors
not
even
those
of
theology
they
were
simply
asked
whether
they
had
any
objections
to
make
the
candidate
might
be
a
stranger
he
might
be
wholly
unfitted
to
teach
theology
he
might
be
free
from
open
immorality
or
heresy
and
therefore
because
the
bishops
could
nothing
against
him
he
was
appointed
to
instruct
the
aspirants
to
the
priesthood
at
breslau
a
foreign
professor
was
appointed
who
began
to
teach
the
most
scandalous
and
heretical
doctrines
complaints
were
useless
during
many
years
his
pupils
drank
in
the
poison
and
at
length
after
he
had
done
his
work
of
destruction
he
was
as
in
mockery
removed
nor
is
this
an
isolated
instance
of
the
ruin
to
catholic
faith
wrought
by
this
system
the
bishops
had
hardly
any
influence
over
the
education
of
their
clergy
who
young
and
ignorant
of
the
world
were
thrown
almost
without
restraint
into
the
pagan
corruptions
of
a
german
university
in
order
to
acquire
a
knowledge
of
theology
at
cologne
a
catholic
college
was
made
over
to
the
protestants
at
erfurt
and
düsseldorf
catholic
were
turned
into
mixed
establishments
with
all
the
professors
save
one
protestants
elementary
education
was
under
the
control
of
provincial
boards
consisting
of
a
protestant
president
and
three
councillors
of
whom
might
be
a
catholic
in
catholic
districts
in
the
catholic
provinces
of
the
rhine
and
westphalia
the
place
of
catholic
councillor
was
left
vacant
for
several
years
till
the
schools
were
all
reorganized
indeed
the
real
superintendent
of
catholic
elementary
education
was
generally
a
protestant
minister
there
was
a
government
for
books
of
religious
instruction
the
headquarters
of
which
were
in
berlin
but
its
agents
were
scattered
throughout
all
the
provinces
all
who
were
employed
in
this
department
to
which
even
the
pastorals
of
the
bishops
had
to
be
submitted
before
being
read
to
their
flocks
were
protestants
the
widest
liberty
was
given
to
protestants
to
attack
the
church
but
when
the
catholics
sought
to
defend
themselves
their
writings
were
suppressed
professor
freudenfeld
was
obliged
to
quit
bonn
because
he
had
spoken
of
luther
without
becoming
respect
permission
to
start
religious
journals
was
denied
to
catholics
but
granted
to
protestants
and
in
the
pulpit
the
priests
were
put
under
strict
restraint
while
the
preachers
were
given
full
liberty
of
speech
whenever
a
community
of
protestants
was
found
in
a
catholic
district
a
church
a
clergyman
and
a
school
were
immediately
provided
for
them
indeed
richer
provision
for
the
protestant
worship
was
made
in
the
catholic
provinces
than
elsewhere
but
when
a
congregation
of
catholics
grew
up
amongst
protestants
the
government
almost
invariably
rejected
their
application
for
permission
to
have
a
place
of
worship
at
various
times
and
places
churches
and
schools
were
taken
from
the
catholics
and
turned
over
to
the
protestants
and
though
prussia
had
received
an
enormous
amount
of
the
confiscated
property
of
the
church
she
did
not
provide
for
the
support
of
the
priests
as
for
that
of
the
ministers
at
court
there
was
not
a
single
catholic
who
held
office
the
heads
of
all
the
departments
of
government
were
protestants
the
department
down
to
the
local
postmasters
was
exclusively
protestant
all
ambassadors
and
other
representatives
of
the
government
though
sent
to
catholic
courts
were
protestants
in
prussia
the
state
is
divided
into
provinces
and
at
the
head
of
each
province
is
a
this
official
to
whom
the
religious
interests
of
the
catholics
were
committed
was
always
a
protestant
the
provinces
are
divided
into
districts
and
at
the
head
of
each
district
was
a
protestant
president
and
almost
all
the
inferior
officers
even
in
catholic
provinces
were
protestants
again
in
the
courts
of
justice
and
in
the
army
all
the
principal
positions
were
given
to
protestants
in
the
two
of
prussia
and
silesia
was
catholic
in
the
army
division
of
posen
in
that
of
westphalia
and
cleves
and
finally
in
that
of
the
rhine
yet
there
was
not
one
catholic
not
a
general
or
major
in
a
royal
order
was
issued
to
provide
for
the
religious
wants
of
the
army
and
every
care
was
taken
for
the
spiritual
needs
of
the
protestant
soldiers
but
not
even
one
catholic
chaplain
was
appointed
all
persons
in
active
service
from
superior
officers
down
to
private
soldiers
were
declared
to
be
members
of
the
military
parish
and
were
placed
under
the
authority
of
the
protestant
chaplains
if
a
catholic
soldier
wished
to
get
married
or
to
have
his
child
baptized
by
a
priest
he
had
first
to
obtain
the
permission
of
his
protestant
curate
what
was
still
more
intolerable
the
law
regulating
military
worship
was
so
contrived
as
to
force
the
catholic
soldiers
to
be
present
at
protestant
service
let
us
now
turn
to
the
relations
of
the
church
in
prussia
with
the
holy
see
all
direct
communications
between
the
catholics
and
the
pope
were
expressly
forbidden
whenever
the
bishops
wished
to
consult
the
holy
father
concerning
the
administration
of
their
dioceses
their
inquiries
had
to
pass
through
the
hands
of
the
protestant
ministry
to
be
forwarded
or
not
at
its
discretion
and
the
answer
of
the
pope
had
to
pass
through
the
same
channel
it
was
not
safe
to
write
for
the
government
had
no
respect
for
the
mails
and
letters
were
habitually
opened
by
order
of
von
nagler
the
who
boasted
that
he
had
never
had
any
idiotic
scruples
about
such
matters
that
prince
constantine
was
his
model
who
had
once
entertained
him
with
narrating
how
he
had
managed
to
get
the
choicest
selection
of
intercepted
letters
in
existence
he
had
had
them
bound
in
morocco
and
they
formed
volumes
of
the
most
interesting
reading
in
his
private
library
thus
the
church
was
ruled
by
a
system
of
espionage
and
bureaucracy
which
hesitated
not
to
violate
all
the
sanctities
of
life
to
accomplish
its
ends
the
bishops
were
reduced
to
a
state
of
abject
dependence
not
being
allowed
to
publish
any
new
regulation
or
to
make
any
appointment
without
the
permission
and
approval
of
the
protestant
from
whom
they
constantly
received
the
most
annoying
and
vexatious
despatches
the
election
of
bishops
was
reduced
to
a
mere
form
when
a
see
became
vacant
the
royal
commissary
visited
the
chapter
and
announced
the
person
whom
the
king
had
selected
to
fill
the
office
declaring
at
the
same
time
that
no
other
would
receive
his
approval
the
minutest
details
of
catholic
worship
were
placed
under
the
supervision
and
control
of
protestant
laymen
who
had
to
decide
how
much
wine
and
how
many
hosts
might
be
used
during
the
year
in
the
different
churches
we
come
now
to
a
matter
vexed
and
often
discussed
in
which
the
trials
of
the
church
in
prussia
prior
to
the
recent
persecutions
finally
culminated
we
allude
to
the
subject
of
marriages
between
catholics
and
protestants
when
in
prussia
got
possession
of
the
greater
part
of
her
catholic
provinces
the
following
order
was
at
once
issued
majesty
enacts
that
children
born
in
wedlock
shall
all
be
educated
in
the
religion
of
the
father
and
that
in
opposition
to
this
law
neither
party
shall
bind
the
apart
from
the
odious
meddling
of
the
state
with
the
rights
of
individuals
and
the
agreements
of
parties
so
closely
and
sacredly
related
as
man
and
wife
there
was
in
this
enactment
a
special
injustice
to
catholics
from
the
fact
that
nearly
all
the
mixed
marriages
in
prussia
were
contracted
by
protestant
government
officials
and
catholic
women
of
the
provinces
to
which
these
agents
had
been
sent
as
these
men
held
lucrative
offices
they
found
no
difficulty
in
making
matrimonial
alliances
and
as
the
children
had
to
be
brought
up
in
the
religion
of
the
father
the
government
was
by
this
means
gradually
establishing
protestant
congregations
throughout
its
catholic
provinces
in
this
law
was
extended
to
the
rhenish
province
and
in
a
document
was
brought
to
light
which
explained
the
object
of
the
extension
that
it
might
prove
an
effectual
measure
against
the
proselyting
system
of
catholics
the
condition
of
the
church
was
indeed
deplorable
with
the
name
of
being
free
she
was
in
truth
enslaved
and
while
the
state
professed
to
respect
her
rights
it
was
using
all
the
power
of
the
most
thoroughly
organized
and
most
heartless
system
of
bureaucracy
and
espionage
to
weaken
and
fetter
her
action
and
even
to
destroy
her
life
this
was
the
state
of
affairs
when
in
the
end
of
von
droste
vischering
one
of
the
greatest
and
noblest
men
of
this
century
worthy
to
be
named
with
athanasius
and
with
ambrose
was
made
archbishop
of
cologne
the
catholic
people
of
prussia
had
long
since
lost
all
faith
in
the
good
intentions
of
the
government
of
whose
acts
and
aims
they
had
full
knowledge
and
it
was
in
order
to
restore
confidence
that
a
man
so
trusted
and
loved
by
them
as
von
droste
vischering
was
promoted
to
the
see
of
cologne
the
doctrines
of
hermes
professor
of
theology
in
the
university
of
bonn
had
just
been
condemned
at
rome
but
the
government
ignored
the
papal
brief
and
continued
to
give
its
support
to
the
hermesians
the
archbishop
nevertheless
condemned
their
writings
and
especially
their
organ
the
theologische
forbade
his
students
to
attend
their
lectures
at
the
university
and
finally
withdrew
his
approbation
altogether
from
the
hermesian
professors
refusing
to
ordain
students
unless
they
formally
renounced
the
proscribed
doctrines
by
a
ministerial
order
issued
in
priests
were
forbidden
under
pain
of
deposition
from
office
to
exact
in
mixed
marriages
any
promise
concerning
the
education
of
the
offspring
a
like
penalty
was
threatened
for
refusing
to
marry
parties
who
were
unwilling
to
make
such
promises
or
for
withholding
absolution
from
those
who
were
bringing
up
their
children
in
the
protestant
religion
to
avert
as
far
as
possible
any
conflict
between
the
church
and
the
government
pius
in
addressed
a
brief
to
the
bishops
of
cologne
treves
münster
and
paderborn
in
which
he
made
every
allowable
concession
to
the
authority
of
the
state
in
the
matter
of
mixed
marriages
the
court
of
berlin
withheld
the
papal
brief
and
taking
advantage
of
the
yielding
disposition
of
archbishop
spiegel
of
cologne
entered
without
the
knowledge
of
the
holy
see
into
a
secret
agreement
with
him
in
which
still
farther
concessions
were
made
and
in
violation
of
catholic
principle
von
droste
vischering
took
as
his
guide
the
papal
brief
and
paid
no
attention
to
such
provisions
of
the
secret
agreement
as
conflicted
with
the
instructions
of
the
holy
father
the
government
took
alarm
and
offered
to
let
fall
the
hermesians
if
the
archbishop
would
yield
in
the
affair
of
mixed
marriages
and
as
this
expedient
failed
measures
of
violence
were
threatened
which
were
soon
carried
into
effect
for
on
the
evening
of
the
of
november
the
archbishop
was
secretly
arrested
and
carried
off
to
the
fortress
of
minden
where
he
was
placed
in
close
confinement
all
communication
with
him
being
cut
off
the
next
morning
the
government
issued
a
in
which
it
entered
its
accusations
against
the
archbishop
in
order
to
justify
its
arbitrary
act
and
to
appease
the
anger
of
the
people
notwithstanding
a
cry
of
indignation
and
grief
was
heard
in
all
the
catholic
provinces
of
prussia
which
was
throughout
germany
and
extended
to
all
europe
lukewarm
catholics
grew
fervent
and
the
very
hermesians
gathered
with
their
sympathies
to
uphold
the
cause
of
the
archbishop
the
archbishop
of
posen
and
the
bishops
of
paderborn
and
münster
announced
their
withdrawal
from
the
secret
convention
which
the
bishop
of
treves
had
already
done
upon
his
and
henceforward
the
priests
throughout
the
kingdom
held
firm
to
the
ecclesiastical
law
on
mixed
marriages
so
that
in
frederic
william
iii
was
forced
to
make
a
declaration
recognizing
the
rights
for
which
they
contended
but
the
archbishop
of
cologne
was
still
a
prisoner
in
the
fortress
of
minden
early
however
in
health
began
to
fail
and
as
the
government
feared
lest
his
death
in
prison
might
produce
unfavorable
comment
he
received
permission
to
withdraw
to
münster
the
next
year
the
king
died
and
his
successor
frederic
william
showed
himself
ready
to
settle
the
dispute
amicably
and
in
other
ways
to
do
justice
to
the
catholics
a
great
victory
had
been
gained
the
secret
convention
was
destroyed
a
certain
liberty
of
communication
with
the
pope
was
granted
to
the
bishops
the
election
of
bishops
was
made
comparatively
free
the
control
of
the
schools
of
theology
was
restored
to
them
the
hermesians
either
submitted
or
were
removed
and
the
catholics
of
germany
awoke
from
a
deathlike
sleep
to
new
and
vigorous
life
an
evidence
of
the
awakening
of
faith
was
given
in
the
fall
of
when
a
million
and
a
half
of
german
catholics
went
in
pilgrimage
with
song
and
prayer
to
treves
nevertheless
many
grievances
remained
unredressed
the
was
still
used
against
the
church
and
when
the
catholics
asked
permission
to
publish
journals
in
which
they
could
defend
themselves
and
their
religious
interests
they
were
told
that
such
publications
were
not
needed
but
when
ronge
the
suspended
priest
sought
to
found
his
sect
of
catholics
he
received
every
encouragement
from
the
government
and
the
earnest
support
of
the
officials
and
nearly
the
entire
press
of
prussia
though
at
this
very
time
every
effort
was
being
made
to
crush
the
the
government
continued
to
find
pretexts
for
meddling
with
the
affairs
of
the
bishops
and
the
newspapers
attacked
the
church
in
the
most
insulting
manner
going
so
far
as
to
demand
that
the
religious
exercises
for
priests
should
be
placed
under
police
supervision
we
have
now
reached
a
memorable
epoch
in
the
history
of
the
catholic
church
in
prussia
the
revolution
of
which
convulsed
germany
to
its
centre
spread
dismay
among
all
classes
and
filled
its
cities
with
riot
and
bloodshed
when
order
was
the
liberties
of
the
church
were
recognized
more
fully
than
they
had
been
for
three
centuries
garcia
moreno
from
the
civilta
cattolica
i
the
atrocious
assassination
of
garcia
moreno
the
president
of
the
republic
of
ecuador
has
filled
the
minds
of
all
good
people
with
the
deepest
grief
and
horror
the
liberals
are
the
only
ones
who
have
mentioned
it
in
their
journals
with
indifference
one
of
them
headed
his
announcement
of
it
victim
of
the
sacred
alluding
with
blasphemous
irony
to
the
act
of
consecration
of
his
people
to
the
adorable
heart
of
our
lord
which
this
truly
pious
ruler
had
made
but
with
the
exception
of
these
reprobates
who
hating
god
can
not
love
mankind
no
one
who
has
any
admiration
of
moral
greatness
can
help
deploring
the
death
of
this
extraordinary
man
a
death
the
more
deplorable
on
account
of
its
coming
not
from
a
natural
cause
but
from
a
detestable
conspiracy
concocted
by
the
enemies
of
all
that
is
good
who
abhorred
equally
the
wisdom
of
his
government
and
the
soundness
of
his
faith
the
london
has
a
despatch
from
paris
of
october
with
the
following
communication
appears
from
authentic
information
which
we
have
received
that
garcia
moreno
lately
president
of
the
republic
of
ecuador
has
been
assassinated
by
a
secret
society
which
extends
through
all
south
america
as
well
as
europe
the
assassin
was
selected
by
lot
and
obtained
admission
to
the
palace
at
quito
one
of
his
accomplices
an
official
who
was
arrested
after
the
murder
was
assured
by
the
president
of
the
before
his
trial
that
he
would
be
pardoned
if
he
turned
evidence
pardoned
said
he
would
be
of
no
use
to
me
if
you
pardon
me
my
comrades
will
not
i
would
rather
be
shot
than
this
decision
of
the
society
to
kill
him
was
known
to
moreno
and
he
informed
the
pope
of
it
in
a
letter
which
we
will
shortly
give
this
illustrious
man
had
governed
the
republic
of
ecuador
for
about
fifteen
years
first
as
dictator
and
afterwards
for
two
consecutive
terms
as
president
and
to
this
office
he
had
just
been
for
a
third
term
by
an
unanimous
vote
he
had
taken
charge
of
the
state
when
it
was
in
an
exceedingly
miserable
condition
and
by
his
lofty
genius
practical
tact
and
perseverance
but
above
all
by
his
piety
and
confidence
in
god
had
completely
renovated
and
restored
not
only
the
morals
of
the
people
but
also
the
whole
political
administration
and
made
the
country
a
perfect
model
of
a
christian
nation
he
was
intending
to
complete
the
work
which
he
had
begun
and
was
able
to
rely
confidently
on
the
of
his
people
whose
reverence
and
love
for
him
were
unbounded
but
all
this
was
intolerable
to
the
liberals
of
our
day
they
could
not
bear
that
in
a
corner
of
the
new
world
the
problem
should
be
solved
which
they
are
trying
to
make
so
perplexing
of
harmony
between
the
state
and
the
church
of
the
combination
of
temporal
prosperity
and
catholic
piety
of
obedience
to
the
civil
law
and
perfect
submission
to
ecclesiastical
authority
this
was
an
insufferable
scandal
for
modern
liberalism
especially
because
such
a
good
example
might
do
much
to
frustrate
the
plans
of
this
perverse
sect
in
other
countries
the
masons
therefore
resolved
to
murder
this
man
whom
they
had
found
to
be
too
brave
and
determined
to
be
checked
in
any
other
way
for
all
the
attempts
they
had
made
to
intimidate
him
or
to
diminish
his
popularity
had
been
entirely
without
effect
moreno
anticipated
the
blow
but
far
from
fearing
it
was
only
the
more
persuaded
to
persevere
in
his
undertaking
regarding
it
as
the
greatest
happiness
to
be
able
to
give
his
life
for
so
holy
a
cause
in
the
last
letter
which
he
wrote
to
the
supreme
pontiff
before
his
assassination
are
these
words
implore
your
apostolic
benediction
most
holy
father
having
been
though
i
did
not
deserve
it
to
the
office
of
president
of
this
catholic
republic
for
another
six
years
although
the
new
term
does
not
begin
till
the
of
august
the
day
on
which
i
take
the
oath
required
by
the
constitution
so
that
then
only
shall
i
need
to
give
your
holiness
an
official
notification
of
my
nevertheless
i
wish
not
to
delay
in
informing
you
of
it
in
order
that
i
may
obtain
from
heaven
the
strength
and
light
which
i
more
than
any
other
one
shall
need
to
keep
me
a
child
of
our
redeemer
and
loyal
and
obedient
to
his
infallible
vicar
and
now
that
the
lodges
of
neighboring
countries
inspired
by
germany
vomit
out
against
me
all
sorts
of
atrocious
insults
and
horrible
calumnies
and
even
secretly
lay
plans
for
my
assassination
i
require
more
than
ever
the
divine
assistance
and
protection
to
live
and
die
in
defence
of
our
holy
religion
and
of
this
beloved
republic
which
god
has
given
me
to
govern
how
fortunate
i
am
most
holy
father
to
be
hated
and
calumniated
for
the
sake
of
our
divine
saviour
and
what
unspeakable
happiness
would
it
be
for
me
if
your
benediction
should
obtain
for
me
the
grace
to
shed
my
blood
for
him
who
though
he
was
god
yet
shed
his
own
on
the
cross
for
us
this
heroic
desire
of
the
fervent
christian
was
granted
he
was
murdered
by
the
enemies
of
christ
in
hatred
of
his
zeal
for
the
restoration
of
the
christian
state
and
of
his
fervent
love
for
the
church
he
is
truly
a
martyr
of
christ
are
not
wenceslaus
of
bohemia
and
canute
of
denmark
numbered
among
the
holy
martyrs
for
the
same
cause
both
of
them
were
killed
in
the
precincts
of
the
temple
of
god
and
moreno
was
carried
back
to
the
church
from
which
he
had
only
just
departed
to
breathe
out
his
noble
soul
into
the
bosom
of
his
creator
ii
the
object
of
masonic
civilization
is
society
without
god
the
results
which
it
has
succeeded
in
achieving
and
which
it
deems
of
such
importance
are
the
separation
of
the
state
from
the
church
liberty
of
worship
the
withdrawal
of
public
charities
from
religious
objects
the
exclusion
of
the
clergy
from
the
work
of
education
the
suppression
of
religious
orders
the
supremacy
of
the
civil
law
and
the
setting
aside
of
the
law
of
the
gospel
only
by
these
means
according
to
the
masons
can
the
happiness
of
the
people
the
prosperity
of
the
state
and
the
increase
of
morality
and
learning
be
attained
these
are
their
fundamental
maxims
now
the
difficulty
was
that
moreno
had
practically
shown
and
was
continuing
to
show
more
completely
every
day
that
the
peace
prosperity
and
greatness
of
a
nation
will
be
in
proportion
to
its
devotion
to
god
and
its
obedience
to
the
church
that
subjection
to
god
and
his
church
far
from
diminishing
ensures
and
increases
the
true
liberty
of
man
that
the
influence
of
the
clergy
promotes
not
only
the
cause
of
morality
but
also
that
of
letters
and
science
that
temporal
interests
are
never
better
cared
for
than
when
they
are
subordinated
to
those
which
are
eternal
and
that
love
of
country
is
never
so
powerful
as
when
it
is
consecrated
by
love
of
the
church
a
man
of
the
most
distinguished
talents
which
had
been
most
fully
cultivated
at
the
university
of
paris
moreno
had
in
his
own
country
occupied
the
most
conspicuous
positions
he
had
been
a
professor
of
the
natural
sciences
rector
of
the
university
representative
senator
of
the
army
dictator
and
president
of
the
republic
in
this
last
office
in
which
he
would
probably
have
been
retained
by
the
nation
through
life
he
showed
what
genius
sanctified
by
religion
can
accomplish
his
first
care
was
to
establish
peace
throughout
the
country
without
which
there
can
be
no
civil
progress
and
he
succeeded
in
doing
so
not
by
compromises
as
is
now
the
fashion
not
by
making
a
monstrous
and
abnormal
amalgamation
of
parties
and
principles
but
by
the
consistent
and
firm
assertion
of
the
principles
of
morality
and
justice
and
by
the
open
and
unhesitating
profession
of
catholicity
his
success
was
so
marked
that
ecuador
very
soon
arrived
at
such
a
perfect
state
of
tranquillity
and
concord
as
to
seem
a
prodigy
among
the
agitated
and
turbulent
republics
in
its
neighborhood
with
the
exception
of
some
local
and
ineffectual
attempts
at
revolution
during
his
first
presidency
which
were
quelled
by
placing
some
of
the
southern
provinces
in
a
state
of
siege
for
fifty
days
ecuador
was
undisturbed
by
sedition
during
the
whole
of
his
long
government
this
was
partly
due
to
the
splendor
of
his
private
and
public
virtues
which
dissipated
the
clouds
of
envy
and
hatred
and
gained
for
him
the
esteem
even
of
his
political
opponents
he
was
chaste
magnanimous
just
impartial
and
so
well
known
for
clearheadedness
that
the
people
often
stopped
him
on
the
streets
to
decide
their
disputes
on
the
spot
and
accepted
his
opinion
as
final
his
disinterestedness
seems
fabulous
when
we
think
of
the
immoderate
cupidity
prevailing
among
modern
politicians
in
his
first
six
years
he
would
not
even
draw
his
salary
being
content
to
live
on
the
income
of
his
own
moderate
fortune
in
his
second
term
he
accepted
it
but
spent
it
almost
entirely
in
works
of
public
utility
and
in
such
works
he
employed
the
whole
of
his
time
when
any
one
endeavored
to
persuade
him
not
to
shorten
his
life
by
such
continual
labor
he
used
to
say
god
wants
me
to
rest
he
will
send
me
illness
or
owing
to
this
unwearying
assiduity
and
his
ardent
love
for
the
good
of
his
people
he
was
able
to
undertake
and
finish
an
amount
of
business
that
would
appear
incredible
were
not
the
evidence
too
strong
to
admit
of
doubt
in
no
of
the
there
is
a
catalogue
of
the
principal
enterprises
which
he
carried
through
in
a
brief
period
they
are
as
follows
a
revision
of
the
constitution
the
paying
of
the
customs
to
the
national
treasury
instead
of
to
the
provincial
ones
as
formerly
national
representation
for
the
country
as
well
as
the
cities
the
establishment
of
a
fiscal
court
and
the
organization
of
the
courts
of
justice
the
foundation
of
a
great
polytechnic
school
which
was
partially
entrusted
to
the
jesuits
the
construction
and
equipment
of
an
astronomical
observatory
which
was
built
and
directed
by
the
jesuits
on
account
of
the
equatorial
position
of
quito
garcia
moreno
who
was
well
versed
in
the
mathematical
sciences
wished
to
make
this
observatory
equal
to
any
in
the
world
he
bought
most
of
the
instruments
with
his
own
private
funds
roads
connecting
different
parts
of
the
country
garcia
moreno
laid
out
and
nearly
completed
five
great
national
roads
the
principal
one
that
from
guayaquil
to
quito
is
eighty
leagues
in
length
it
is
paved
and
has
one
hundred
and
twenty
bridges
it
is
a
solid
and
stupendous
work
constructed
in
the
face
of
almost
insuperable
difficulties
the
establishment
of
four
new
dioceses
a
concordat
with
the
holy
see
the
reformation
of
the
regular
clergy
the
restoration
among
them
of
a
common
and
monastic
life
the
reconstruction
of
the
army
the
army
had
been
a
mere
horde
without
organization
discipline
or
uniform
the
men
hardly
had
shoes
moreno
organized
them
on
the
french
system
clothed
shod
and
disciplined
them
now
they
are
the
model
as
well
as
the
defence
of
the
people
the
building
of
a
at
guayaquil
previously
there
had
been
none
on
the
whole
coast
reforms
in
the
collection
of
the
customs

put
an
end
to
and
the
revenues
trebled
colleges
in
all
the
cities

in
even
the
smallest

all
conducted
by
the
christian
brothers
schools
for
girls
sisters
of
charity
ladies
of
the
sacred
heart
sisters
of
the
good
shepherd
of
providence
and
little
sisters
of
the
poor
public
hospitals
during
his
first
presidency
moreno
turned
out
the
director
of
the
hospital
at
quito
who
had
refused
to
receive
a
poor
man
and
was
very
negligent
of
his
duties
and
made
himself
director
in
his
stead
he
visited
the
hospital
every
day
improved
its
arrangements
and
put
it
in
good
working
order
he
performed
in
it
many
acts
of
heroic
charity
the
maintenance
and
increase
of
lay
congregations
and
orders
he
was
an
active
member
of
the
congregation
of
the
poor
the
establishment
of
four
museums
the
catholic
protectory
a
vast
and
magnificent
school
of
arts
and
trades
on
the
plan
of
michele
at
rome
and
conducted
by
the
christian
brothers
postal
conventions
with
various
foreign
states
the
embellishment
and
restoration
of
the
cities
guayaquil
and
especially
quito
seemed
as
if
they
had
been
rebuilt
and
he
accomplished
all
this
not
only
without
increasing
the
taxes
but
even
diminishing
some
of
them
this
is
the
reason
why
he
was
so
much
beloved
by
the
people
why
they
called
him
father
of
his
country
and
saviour
of
the
republic
but
it
was
also
this
which
was
his
unpardonable
sin
which
had
to
promptly
receive
a
chastisement
which
should
serve
as
a
warning
for
his
successors
that
they
might
not
dare
to
imitate
his
manner
of
government
for
such
a
course
as
his
was
sure
to
ruin
the
credit
of
masonry
in
the
popular
mind
iii
moreno
loved
his
country
and
worked
so
hard
for
its
good
because
he
was
truly
and
thoroughly
religious
every
one
who
really
loves
god
loves
his
neighbor
also
and
he
who
loves
god
intensely
loves
his
neighbor
in
the
same
way
because
he
sees
in
him
the
image
of
god
and
the
price
of
his
blood
when
he
was
a
student
in
paris
he
was
admired
for
his
piety
in
his
own
country
amid
the
continual
cares
and
heavy
responsibilities
of
his
office
he
always
found
time
to
hear
mass
every
morning
and
say
the
rosary
every
night
in
his
familiar
conversation
he
spoke
frequently
of
god
of
religion
of
virtue
and
with
such
fervor
that
all
who
heard
felt
their
hearts
touched
and
moved
by
his
words
before
beginning
the
business
of
the
day
he
always
made
a
visit
to
the
church
to
implore
light
from
the
source
of
all
wisdom
and
he
had
just
left
it
as
we
have
said
when
he
met
the
ambuscade
which
was
prepared
for
him
this
religious
spirit
produced
in
him
a
great
zeal
for
the
glory
of
god
and
that
devotion
to
the
vicar
of
christ
which
in
him
so
much
resembled
the
affection
of
a
child
for
his
father
let
it
suffice
to
say
that
when
he
had
to
arrange
the
concordat
with
the
holy
see
he
sent
his
ambassador
to
rome
with
a
blank
sheet
signed
by
himself
telling
him
to
ask
his
holiness
to
write
on
it
whatever
seemed
to
him
right
and
conducive
to
the
good
of
the
church
and
the
true
welfare
of
the
nation
such
was
the
confidence
which
he
reposed
in
the
pope
with
whom
politicians
are
accustomed
to
treat
as
if
he
were
an
ambitious
and
designing
foreign
prince
instead
of
being
the
father
of
all
the
faithful
when
the
revolution
entered
rome
in
triumph
through
the
breach
of
porta
pia
garcia
moreno
was
the
only
ruler
in
the
world
who
dared
to
enter
a
solemn
protest
against
that
sacrilegious
invasion
and
he
obtained
from
his
congress
a
considerable
sum
as
a
monthly
subsidy
and
tribute
of
affection
to
his
holiness
but
his
piety
toward
god
and
his
filial
love
to
the
church
can
best
be
seen
from
the
message
to
congress
which
he
finished
a
few
hours
before
his
death
and
which
was
found
on
his
dead
body
steeped
in
his
blood
although
it
is
somewhat
long
for
the
limits
of
an
article
we
think
that
we
ought
to
present
it
to
our
readers
as
an
imperishable
monument
of
true
piety
and
enlightened
policy
and
as
a
lesson
for
the
false
politicians
of
the
present
day
and
of
days
to
come
the
message
is
as
follows
and
deputies
i
count
among
the
greatest
of
the
great
blessings
which
god
has
in
the
inexhaustible
abundance
of
his
mercy
granted
to
our
republic
that
of
seeing
you
here
assembled
under
his
protection
in
the
shadow
of
his
peace
which
he
has
granted
and
still
grants
to
us
while
we
are
nothing
and
can
do
nothing
and
only
give
in
return
for
his
paternal
goodness
inexcusable
and
shameful
ingratitude
is
only
a
few
years
since
ecuador
had
to
repeat
daily
these
sad
words
which
the
liberator
bolivar
addressed
in
his
last
message
to
the
congress
of
blush
to
have
to
acknowledge
that
independence
is
the
only
good
which
we
have
acquired
and
that
we
have
lost
all
the
rest
in
acquiring
since
the
time
when
placing
all
our
hope
in
god
we
escaped
from
the
torrent
of
impiety
and
apostasy
which
overwhelms
the
world
in
this
age
of
blindness
since
when
we
reformed
ourselves
into
a
truly
catholic
nation
everything
has
been
on
a
course
of
steady
and
daily
improvement
and
the
prosperity
of
our
dear
country
has
been
continually
increasing
was
not
long
ago
a
body
from
which
the
was
ebbing
and
which
was
even
like
a
corpse
already
a
prey
to
a
horrible
swarm
of
vermin
which
the
liberty
of
putrefaction
engendered
in
the
darkness
of
the
tomb
but
at
the
command
of
that
sovereign
voice
which
called
lazarus
from
the
sepulchre
it
has
returned
to
life
though
it
still
has
not
entirely
cast
off
the
and
bandages
that
is
to
say
the
remains
and
effects
of
the
misery
and
corruption
in
which
it
had
been
buried
justify
what
i
have
said
it
will
suffice
for
me
to
give
a
short
sketch
of
the
progress
which
has
been
made
in
these
last
two
years
referring
you
to
the
various
departments
of
the
government
for
documentary
and
detailed
information
and
that
you
may
see
exactly
how
far
we
have
advanced
in
this
period
of
regeneration
i
shall
compare
our
present
condition
with
that
from
which
we
started
not
for
our
own
glory
and
but
to
glorify
him
to
whom
we
owe
everything
and
whom
we
adore
as
our
redeemer
and
our
father
our
protector
and
our
here
follows
an
enumeration
of
all
the
improvements
which
had
been
made
he
continues
owe
to
the
perfect
liberty
which
the
church
has
among
us
and
to
the
apostolic
zeal
of
its
excellent
prelates
the
reformation
of
the
clergy
the
amendment
of
morals
and
the
reduction
of
crimes
which
is
so
great
that
in
our
population
of
a
million
there
are
not
enough
criminals
to
fill
the
penitentiary
the
church
also
we
owe
those
religious
corporations
which
produce
such
an
abundance
of
excellent
results
by
the
instruction
of
childhood
and
youth
and
by
the
succor
which
they
give
so
liberally
to
the
sick
and
to
the
destitute
we
are
also
debtors
to
these
religious
for
the
renewal
of
the
spirit
of
piety
in
this
year
of
jubilee
and
of
sanctification
and
for
the
conversion
to
christianity
and
civilization
of
nine
thousand
savages
in
the
eastern
province
in
which
on
account
of
its
vast
extent
there
are
good
reasons
for
establishing
a
second
vicariate
if
you
authorize
me
to
ask
the
holy
see
for
this
foundation
we
will
then
consult
as
to
what
measures
to
take
to
promote
the
commerce
of
this
province
and
to
put
an
end
to
the
selfish
speculations
and
the
violent
exactions
to
which
its
poor
inhabitants
have
been
a
prey
by
reason
of
the
cruelty
of
inhuman
merchants
the
laborers
however
for
this
field
are
not
now
to
be
had
and
that
those
which
we
shall
have
may
be
properly
trained
it
is
right
that
you
should
give
a
yearly
subsidy
to
our
venerable
and
zealous
archbishop
to
assist
him
in
building
the
great
seminary
which
he
has
not
hesitated
to
begin
trusting
in
the
protection
of
heaven
and
in
our
not
forget
legislators
that
our
little
successes
would
be
ephemeral
and
without
fruit
if
we
had
not
founded
the
social
order
of
our
republic
upon
the
rock
always
resisted
and
always
victorious
of
the
catholic
church
its
divine
teaching
which
neither
men
nor
nations
can
neglect
and
be
saved
is
the
rule
of
our
institutions
the
law
of
our
laws
docile
and
faithful
children
of
our
venerable
august
and
infallible
pontiff
whom
all
the
great
ones
of
the
earth
are
abandoning
and
who
is
being
oppressed
by
vile
cowardly
and
impious
men
we
have
continued
to
send
him
monthly
the
little
contribution
which
you
voted
in
though
our
weakness
obliges
us
to
remain
passive
spectators
of
his
slow
martyrdom
let
us
hope
that
this
poor
gift
may
at
least
be
a
proof
of
our
sympathy
and
affection
and
a
pledge
of
our
obedience
and
fidelity
a
few
days
the
term
for
which
i
was
elected
in
will
expire
the
republic
has
enjoyed
six
years
of
peace
interrupted
only
by
a
revolt
of
a
few
days
in
at
riobamba
of
the
natives
against
the
whites
and
in
these
six
years
it
has
advanced
rapidly
on
the
path
of
true
progress
under
the
visible
protection
of
divine
providence
the
results
achieved
would
certainly
have
been
greater
if
i
had
possessed
the
abilities
for
government
which
unfortunately
i
lack
or
if
all
that
was
needed
to
accomplish
good
was
ardently
to
desire
it
i
have
committed
faults
i
ask
pardon
for
them
a
thousand
times
and
beg
it
with
tears
from
all
my
countrymen
feeling
confident
that
they
have
been
unintentional
if
on
the
contrary
you
think
that
in
any
respect
i
have
succeeded
give
the
honor
of
the
success
in
the
first
place
to
god
and
to
his
immaculate
mother
to
whom
are
committed
the
inexhaustible
treasures
of
his
mercy
and
in
the
second
place
to
yourselves
to
the
people
to
the
army
and
to
all
those
who
in
the
different
branches
of
the
government
have
assisted
me
with
intelligence
and
fidelity
in
the
fulfilment
of
my
difficult
duties
garcia
moreno
august
that
is
the
way
that
a
really
catholic
ruler
can
speak
even
in
this
xixth
century
it
seems
while
we
read
his
words
as
if
we
were
listening
to
ferdinand
of
castile
or
some
other
one
of
the
saintly
kings
of
the
most
prosperous
days
of
christianity
with
great
justice
then
did
the
government
of
ecuador
when
it
published
this
message
which
was
found
as
we
have
said
on
dead
body
append
to
it
the
following
note
message
which
we
have
just
given
is
the
solemn
voice
of
one
who
is
dead
or
better
it
is
his
last
will
and
testament
actually
sealed
with
his
own
blood
for
our
noble
president
had
just
written
it
with
his
own
hand
when
he
was
assailed
by
his
murderers
its
last
words
are
those
of
a
dying
father
who
blessing
his
children
turns
for
the
last
time
toward
them
his
eyes
darkened
by
the
shadow
of
death
and
asks
pardon
of
them
as
if
he
had
been
doing
anything
during
all
their
lives
but
loading
them
with
benefits
deeply
moved
and
distressed
by
grief
we
seek
in
vain
for
words
adequate
to
express
our
love
and
veneration
for
him
posterity
no
doubt
will
honor
the
undying
memory
of
the
great
ruler
the
wise
politician
the
noble
patriot
and
the
saintly
defender
of
the
faith
who
has
been
so
basely
assassinated
his
country
worthily
represented
by
their
present
legislators
will
shed
tears
over
this
tomb
which
contains
such
great
virtues
and
such
great
hopes
and
will
gratefully
record
on
imperishable
tablets
the
glorious
name
of
this
her
son
who
regardless
of
his
own
blood
and
life
lived
and
died
only
for
this
splendid
eulogy
is
an
echo
of
the
eternal
benediction
and
a
reflection
of
the
brilliant
crown
which
we
can
not
doubt
that
god
has
given
to
this
his
latest
martyr
iv
the
reader
will
see
that
this
message
of
garcia
moreno
contains
a
true
and
genuine
scheme
of
christian
government
which
he
applied
in
the
republic
of
ecuador
in
direct
opposition
to
the
ideas
and
aspirations
of
modern
liberalism
every
point
of
it
is
in
most
marked
contrast
to
the
liberalist
programme
at
some
risk
of
repetition
we
will
here
make
a
short
comparison
between
the
two
on
account
of
the
importance
of
the
conclusions
which
all
prudent
men
can
draw
from
it
moreno
begins
with
god
and
puts
him
at
the
head
of
the
government
of
his
people
liberalism
would
have
the
state
atheistic
and
is
ashamed
even
to
mention
the
name
of
god
in
its
public
documents
moreno
desires
an
intimate
union
between
the
state
and
the
catholic
church
declaring
that
the
social
order
must
be
founded
on
the
church
and
that
her
divine
teaching
must
be
the
rule
of
human
institutions
and
the
law
of
civil
laws
liberalism
on
the
other
hand
not
only
separates
the
state
from
the
church
but
even
raises
it
above
her
and
makes
the
civil
laws
the
standard
in
harmony
with
which
the
ecclesiastical
laws
must
be
framed
it
even
would
subject
the
most
essential
institutions
of
the
church
to
the
caprice
of
man
moreno
desires
full
liberty
for
the
bishops
and
ascribes
to
this
liberty
the
reform
of
the
clergy
and
the
good
morals
of
the
people
liberalism
wants
to
fetter
episcopal
action
excites
the
inferior
clergy
to
rebellion
against
their
prelates
and
endeavors
to
withdraw
the
people
from
the
influence
of
either
moreno
not
only
supports
but
multiplies
religious
communities
liberalism
suppresses
them
moreno
respects
ecclesiastical
property
and
promotes
by
the
resources
of
the
state
the
foundation
of
new
seminaries
saying
that
without
them
it
will
not
be
possible
worthily
to
fill
the
ranks
of
the
sacred
ministry
liberalism
confiscates
the
goods
of
the
church
closes
the
seminaries
and
sends
the
young
levites
to
the
barracks
to
be
educated
in
the
dissipation
and
license
of
military
life
moreno
confides
to
the
clergy
and
to
the
religious
orders
the
training
and
instruction
of
youth
liberalism
secularizes
education
and
insists
on
the
entire
exclusion
of
the
religious
element
moreno
removes
from
his
catholic
nation
the
wiles
and
scandals
of
false
religion
liberalism
promulgates
freedom
of
worship
and
opens
the
door
to
every
heresy
in
faith
and
to
every
corruption
in
morals
moreno
finally
sees
in
himself
the
weakness
inherent
in
man
and
gives
god
credit
for
all
the
good
which
he
accomplishes
while
liberalism
full
of
satanic
pride
believes
itself
capable
of
everything
and
places
all
its
confidence
in
the
natural
powers
of
man
the
antagonism
between
the
two
systems
is
in
short
universal
and
absolute
now
what
is
the
verdict
of
experience
it
is
that
the
application
of
system
has
resulted
in
peace
prosperity
the
moral
and
material
welfare
of
the
people
in
a
word
social
happiness
on
the
contrary
the
application
of
the
liberalist
system
has
produced
discord
general
misery
enormous
taxation
immorality
among
the
people
and
public
scandals
and
has
driven
society
to
the
verge
of
destruction
and
dissolution
the
liberty
which
it
has
given
has
been
well
defined
by
moreno
it
is
the
liberty
of
a
corpse
the
liberty
to
rot
and
at
this
juncture
the
infamous
wickedness
and
the
despicable
logic
of
the
liberalist
party
can
no
longer
be
concealed
it
has
laid
it
down
as
certain
that
the
principles
of
the
middle
ages
as
it
calls
them
which
are
the
true
catholic
principles
the
principles
affirmed
by
our
holy
father
pius
ix
in
his
syllabus
are
not
applicable
to
modern
times
and
can
no
longer
give
happiness
to
nations
but
here
is
a
ruler
garcia
moreno
by
name
who
gives
the
lie
to
this
grovelling
falsehood
and
shows
by
the
irresistible
evidence
of
facts
that
the
happiness
of
his
people
has
actually
come
simply
from
the
application
of
these
principles
what
is
the
answer
of
the
liberalist
sect
to
this
manifest
confutation
of
their
theory
first
it
endeavors
to
cry
down
its
formidable
adversary
by
invective
and
calumny
and
then
finding
that
this
does
not
suffice
to
remove
him
from
public
life
it
murders
him
this
is
the
only
means
it
has
to
prove
its
thesis
and
having
made
use
of
it
it
begins
to
shriek
louder
than
before
that
catholic
principles
can
not
be
adapted
to
the
progress
of
this
age
no
we
agree
that
they
can
not
if
you
are
going
to
kill
every
one
who
adapts
them
what
use
is
it
to
argue
with
a
sect
so
malicious
and
perverse
o
patience
of
god
and
of
men
how
basely
are
you
abused
a
revival
in
frogtown
there
was
quite
an
excitement
in
frogtown
the
rev
eliphalet
notext
great
revivalist
who
had
made
more
converts
than
any
other
man
in
england
ireland
scotland
wales
the
united
states
and
territories
and
the
british
provinces
of
north
america
was
to
a
three
in
the
town
now
frogtown
prided
itself
on
being
the
wickedest
little
town
in
the
west
its
inhabitants
claimed
for
it
the
enviable
distinction
of
being
fastest
little
village
of
its
size
in
the
united
a
weakness
common
to
most
small
towns
this
pride
in
vice
is
a
widespread
weakness
the
lean
and
slippered
pantaloon
will
wag
his
fallen
chaps
and
give
evident
signs
of
pleasant
titillation
when
some
contemporary
tells
a
rascal
the
dog
was
in
his
well
the
frogtowners
flattered
themselves
that
brother
notext
would
find
their
burgh
a
very
hard
nut
to
crack
brother
notext
was
not
a
theologian
he
was
not
a
scholar
he
was
not
a
preacher
in
truth
he
was
almost
illiterate
but
he
understood
the
of
getting
up
revivals
he
knew
how
to
create
a
sensation
he
could
at
least
achieve
a
success
of
curiosity
as
the
french
say
he
began
with
the
newspapers
of
course
he
contrived
to
have
them
say
something
about
him
and
his
in
every
issue
he
was
not
particular
whether
what
they
said
of
him
was
favorable
or
unfavorable
indeed
he
rather
preferred
that
some
of
them
should
abuse
him
roundly
abuse
sometimes
helped
him
more
than
praise
it
made
some
people
his
friends
through
a
spirit
of
contradiction
it
appealed
to
the
pugnacious
instincts
of
some
of
it
enabled
him
to
hint
that
the
inimical
editors
were
papal
myrmidons
jesuit
emissaries
etc
the
rev
eliphalet
was
really
an
excellent
organizer
he
had
been
originally
the
business
manager
of
a
circus
his
advertisements
his
posters
his
in
his
old
occupation
were
prepared
with
all
the
gorgeous
imagery
of
the
east
he
did
not
forget
his
old
tactics
in
his
new
profession
immediately
on
his
arrival
in
frogtown
he
grappled
the
newspapers
he
begged
bullied
or
badgered
the
editors
until
they
noticed
him
he
set
the
christian
juveniles
and
the
kindred
societies
to
work
with
whom
of
course
there
was
no
difficulty
in
a
couple
of
days
he
succeeded
in
drawing
around
him
the
clergymen
of
every
denomination
except
the
episcopalian
and
unitarian
some
of
these
however
went
much
against
their
will
the
episcopalian
minister
a
gentle
amiable
man
was
very
loath
at
first
but
the
pressure
brought
to
bear
upon
him
was
too
strong
he
finally
succumbed
and
joined
in
what
was
called
a
union
christian
meeting
of
all
the
protestant
congregations
this
important
point
achieved
notext
had
three
of
the
in
each
congregation
selected
these
he
sent
among
the
people
to
raise
the
sinews
of
war
without
which
no
campaign
whether
sacred
or
profane
can
be
conducted
to
a
successful
issue
terms
were
reasonable
only
three
hundred
dollars
a
week
and
found
a
man
must
live
and
when
a
man
works
hard
as
notext
undoubtedly
did
he
must
live
well
or
he
can
not
stand
the
strain
on
his
physical
and
mental
strength
then
there
were
blank
weeks
when
he
had
no
revival
in
hand
and
probably
a
hotel
bill
to
pay
taking
these
things
into
consideration
any
reasonable
person
will
allow
that
three
hundred
dollars
a
week
and
found
was
not
an
exorbitant
price
notext
had
a
large
tent
which
the
profane
said
had
been
formerly
used
in
his
old
business
it
was
pitched
in
a
vacant
lot
within
the
city
limits
and
could
accommodate
about
fifteen
hundred
persons
notext
prevailed
on
the
clergymen
who
united
with
him
to
close
their
churches
on
the
first
sunday
of
his
revival
on
the
previous
friday
he
gathered
around
him
a
number
of
male
and
female
enthusiasts
accompanied
by
these
people
organized
in
squads
and
led
by
the
regular
revival
practitioners
who
did
what
is
profanely
termed
the
business
in
all
tours
he
sang
hymns
in
front
of
every
in
the
town
the
instrumental
accompaniment
to
the
singing
was
furnished
by
a
melodeon
which
was
carried
about
in
a
cart
on
sunday
the
union
meetings
began
and
notwithstanding
a
heavy
rain
the
tent
was
full
a
large
platform
had
been
erected
inside
and
near
the
door
was
a
table
on
which
were
exposed
for
sale
a
great
variety
of
contributions
to
religious
literature
all
by
one
author
who
had
evidently
tried
every
string
of
the
religious
lyre
there
were
collections
of
hymns
by
the
rev
notext
tracts
by
the
rev
notext
sermons
by
the
rev
notext
tales
for
the
young
by
the

notext
appeals
to
the
old
by
the

reasons
for

the

notext
etc
there
were
photographs
in
every
style
of
the
rev
notext
as
well
as
likenesses
of
remarkable
converts
who
had
been
remarkable
rascals
until
they
through
the
efforts
of
the
rev
notext
on
the
platform
were
seated
the
shepherds
of
most
of
the
flocks
in
frogtown
some
among
them
it
is
true
did
not
seem
quite
at
home
in
that
situation
but
they
had
to
be
there
in
the
centre
of
the
platform
was
an
organ
which
furnished
the
instrumental
music
on
each
side
of
the
organ
seats
were
arranged
for
a
volunteer
choir
fully
half
those
present
were
children
the
rev
eliphalet
notext
was
introduced
to
the
audience
by
the
minister
of
the
methodist
church
the
revivalist
was
a
stout
rather
man
inclined
to
corpulency
evidently
not
an
ascetic
and
gifted
with
no
inconsiderable
share
of
physical
energy
and
magnetism
wish
all
persons
who
can
sing
to
come
on
the
platform
and
occupy
the
seats
to
the
right
and
left
of
the
organ
he
began
no
movement
was
made
in
response
to
this
call
it
was
repeated
with
a
better
result
a
dozen
young
ladies
summoned
up
enough
courage
to
mount
the
platform
will
never
do
cried
notext
want
every
person
present
who
can
sing
right
here
on
this
stand
we
get
along
without
music
and
plenty
of
he
continued
turning
toward
the
clergymen
on
the
platform
know
the
singers
in
your
congregations
go
among
them
and
send
them
up
here
everybody
must
put
his
shoulder
to
the
wheel
in
the
great
work
of
bringing
souls
to
the
brethren
meekly
did
as
they
were
bid
they
soon
succeeded
in
filling
the
seats
reserved
for
the
singers
these
numbered
about
one
hundred
more
like
it
said
notext
approvingly
my
friends
we
will
begin
by
singing
a
hymn
i
want
everybody
to
join
a
nod
to
the
organist
who
began
to
play
the
singing
was
rather
timid
at
first
but
led
by
notext
the
singers
rapidly
gained
confidence
and
soon
rolled
forth
in
full
chorus
having
fairly
launched
them
their
leader
after
the
first
verse
left
them
to
take
care
of
themselves
the
singing
was
really
good
the
rich
volume
of
harmony
drowned
the
commonplace
melody
and
the
vulgar
words
thus
brother
notext
was
successful
in
the
production
of
his
first
effect
it
was
evident
that
he
depended
much
on
the
singing
there
is
nothing
like
a
grand
mass
of
choral
music
to
excite
the
sensibilities
after
two
or
three
hymns
the
revivalist
had
his
audience
in
a
highly
emotional
condition
want
all
the
children
together
in
front
shouted
notext
the
accent
on
the
first
syllable
will
retire
to
the
back
seats
stop
the
music
keep
up
the
singing
go
on
go
on
then
he
ran
to
the
organ
whispered
something
to
the
organist
and
led
off
with
you
must
be
a
lover
of
the
lord
or
you
go
to
heaven
when
you
die
leaving
the
singers
to
sing
it
out
for
themselves
after
the
first
two
or
three
lines
it
took
some
time
to
get
all
the
children
to
the
front
if
the
music
flagged
notext
shouted
to
the
singers
to
it
from
time
to
time
he
would
rush
to
the
organ
pick
up
a
in
a
frantic
manner
and
lead
off
with
a
new
hymn
waving
his
hands
in
cadence
but
with
a
due
regard
for
his
lungs
not
singing
a
note
more
than
was
absolutely
necessary
to
start
the
other
singers
afresh
the
fathers
and
mothers
of
the
little
ones
softened
by
the
music
looked
with
moistened
eyes
on
their
children
as
the
latter
took
their
seats
the
american
people
are
very
fond
of
children
when
they
are
old
enough
to
walk
and
talk
and
be
interesting
notext
was
alive
to
this
fact
even
the
worst
criminal
or
the
most
cynical
man
of
the
world
can
not
help
being
touched
while
music
charms
his
ears
and
his
eyes
look
on
the
beautiful
spectacle
of
childish
innocence
notext
evidently
knew
the
more
amiable
weaknesses
of
human
nature
he
appealed
to
the
senses
and
the
affections
and
won
over
the
fathers
and
mothers
through
the
children
my
little
friends
said
notext
wish
you
all
to
keep
perfectly
silent
while
i
am
talking
to
you
this
first
meeting
is
especially
for
there
was
considerable
buzzing
among
the
little
ones
must
have
silence
if
i
am
to
do
anything
with
these
children
said
notext
rather
testily
and
in
a
tone
which
showed
that
he
would
not
scruple
to
apply
the
birch
to
his
little
friends
if
they
did
not
keep
quiet
slightest
noise
distracts
their
attention
there
are
some
boys
to
the
right
there
who
are
still
talking
i
wish
some
one
would
stop
a
gentleman
with
long
hair
and
green
goggles
went
to
the
designated
group
remonstrated
with
and
finally
succeeded
in
silencing
them
then
notext
began
his
sermon
to
the
children
he
told
the
story
of
the
passion
in
a
manner
which
though
it
inexpressibly
shocked
christians
of
the
kind
who
happened
to
be
present
was
exceedingly
dramatic
in
the
highest
degree
to
borrow
a
word
from
the
modern
suddenly
he
broke
off
and
said
rather
excitedly
is
a
boy
on
the
fourth
bench
who
persists
in
talking
i
must
have
absolute
silence
or
i
can
not
hold
the
attention
of
these
children
the
slightest
noise
distracts
them
and
takes
their
minds
away
from
the
picture
i
am
endeavoring
to
present
to
them
it
is
that
boy
will
somebody
please
to
take
him
away
several
pious
gentlemen
bore
down
on
the
poor
little
urchin
and
all
chance
of
was
taken
away
from
him
for
the
nonce
by
his
summary
removal
when
silence
was
restored
notext
resumed
the
story
when
describing
how
the
divine
victim
was
buffeted
and
spat
upon
he
administered
to
himself
sounding
slaps
on
the
face
now
with
the
left
hand
now
with
the
right
he
placed
an
imaginary
crown
of
thorns
on
his
head
pressed
the
sharp
points
into
his
forehead
and
passing
the
open
fingers
of
both
hands
over
his
closed
eyes
and
down
his
face
traced
the
streams
of
blood
trickling
from
the
cruel
wounds
tears
already
rolled
down
the
cheeks
of
the
little
ones
when
he
reached
the
nailing
to
the
cross
he
produced
a
large
spike
exhibited
it
to
the
children
and
went
through
the
semblance
of
driving
it
into
his
flesh
an
outburst
of
sobs
interrupted
him
some
of
the
children
screamed
in
very
terror
the
desired
effect
was
produced
many
fathers
and
mothers
touched
by
the
emotion
and
terror
of
their
children
wept
in
sympathy
with
them
the
music
shouted
notext
stamping
with
impatience
as
if
he
wanted
a
tardy
patient
to
swallow
a
in
the
proper
moment
of
effervescence
the
music
and
he
led
off
with
you
must
be
a
lover
of
the
lord
or
you
go
to
heaven
when
you
die
he
shouted
to
the
to
go
among
the
people
and
ask
them
to
to
a
crowd
of
some
professional
some
enthusiastic
volunteers
broke
loose
upon
the
audience
they
seized
people
by
the
hands
they
embraced
them
they
inquired
do
you
feel
now
do
you
not
feel
that
jesus
is
calling
you
they
begged
them
to
come
to
jesus
at
once
they
asked
them
if
they
were
one
of
the
workers
met
two
gentlemen
who
entered
together
and
were
evidently
present
through
curiosity
of
the
first
who
seemed
to
be
a
cool
keen
business
man
the
worker
asked
the
stereotyped
question
you
a
course
of
course
said
the
business
man
the
worker
passed
on
perfectly
satisfied
with
the
declaration
he
repeated
the
question
to
the
companion
who
possessed
of
less
assurance
hesitated
and
humbly
replied
trust
the
worker
immediately
grappled
the
sensitive
gentleman
much
to
his
mortification
and
it
was
some
time
before
he
succeeded
in
effecting
his
escape
regretting
doubtless
that
he
had
not
made
as
prompt
and
satisfactory
a
profession
of
faith
as
that
of
his
companion
the
meeting
as
the
exercises
toward
the
close
were
named
was
continued
until
late
in
the
afternoon
when
the
children
were
dismissed
they
were
instructed
to
beg
their
parents
to
come
to
jesus
to
entreat
them
with
tears
if
necessary
until
they
consented
a
presbyterian
gentleman
of
the
old
school
describing
his
sensations
after
the
meeting
was
over
said
can
not
deny
that
i
was
affected
i
felt
tears
coming
to
my
eyes
why
i
could
not
tell
the
effect
however
was
entirely
physical
my
reason
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
it
condemned
the
whole
thing
as
merely
calculated
to
get
up
an
unhealthy
excitement
which
even
if
not
injurious
would
be
fleeting
in
its
effect
i
noticed
some
nervous
women
almost
worked
up
into
spasms
as
to
the
children
they
were
goaded
into
a
state
of
nervousness
and
terror
which
was
pitiable
to
see
i
can
only
compare
my
own
condition
to
that
of
a
man
who
had
drunk
freely
while
the
effect
lasted
i
was
capable
of
making
a
fool
of
myself
being
all
the
while
aware
that
i
was
doing
so
sunlight
and
air
have
dispelled
the
intoxication
and
now
nothing
remains
but
nausea
am
disgusted
with
such
claptrap
and
ashamed
of
myself
for
having
been
affected
by
it
however
temporarily
and
the
progress
made
on
the
first
sunday
of
the
revival
was
duly
chronicled
in
the
newspapers
of
the
day
following
it
was
announced
that
hundreds
of
children
had
been
awakened
to
a
sense
of
their
sinful
condition
a
little
girl
four
years
old
had
recognized
that
she
was
thoroughly
steeped
in
sin
she
had
had
no
idea
of
the
condition
of
her
soul
until
she
was
roused
to
it
by
preaching
she
was
now
perfectly
happy
she
had
experienced
religion
she
knew
she
was
forgiven
she
had
gone
to
jesus
and
jesus
had
come
to
her
she
had
sought
lodgings
leading
her
father
with
one
hand
and
her
mother
with
the
other
charley
biggs
the
drunken
alderman
was
among
the
converted
he
had
religion
and
was
resolved
henceforth
to
touch
the
toddy
nevermore
a
belated
of
one
of
the
newspapers
while
returning
to
his
lodgings
on
the
previous
evening
had
his
pulled
much
to
his
surprise
by
a
little
girl
about
six
years
old
sir
she
asked
you
know
jesus
the
was
struck
dumb
sir
she
continued
you
please
come
to
jesus
this
was
enough
the
hard
the
was
touched
he
sobbed
he
wept
he
cried
aloud
he
fell
upon
his
knees
the
little
girl
fell
on
hers
they
sang
to
jesus
come
to
jesus
come
to
jesus
just
now
etc
when
the
rose
after
the
conclusion
of
the
singing
he
took
the
little
hand
and
went
whither
she
led
him
he
too
had
somewhat
as
one
gets
a
de
or
a
stroke
of
paralysis
the
opposition
dailies
mildly
called
attention
to
the
purely
emotional
character
of
the
effects
produced
they
expressed
their
fears
that
the
moral
and
physical
result
of
factitious
excitement
on
minds
of
tender
years
might
be
the
reverse
of
healthy
the
next
day
the
melodeon
was
carted
about
again
and
the
singing
continued
on
the
sidewalks
and
in
front
of
the
machinery
was
in
full
blast
the
meeting
on
the
second
evening
was
devoted
principally
to
grown
people
the
tent
was
full
the
choir
was
strengthened
by
additional
voices
and
the
music
was
good
of
its
kind
after
half
a
dozen
hymns
had
been
sung
notext
began
his
sermon
by
courtesy
he
first
spoke
of
the
number
of
persons
he
had
converted
at
home
and
abroad
for
he
had
been
as
he
took
care
to
let
his
audience
know
he
had
been
the
guest
and
the
favored
companion
of
the
duchess
of
skippington
of
the
earl
of
whitefriars
of
lord
this
and
lady
that
and
the
countess
of
thingumy
in
scotland
and
in
ireland
immense
crowds
followed
him
and
he
converted
three
thousand
people
in
a
single
town
in
ireland
since
the
meeting
on
the
previous
day
many
children
and
many
adults
as
well
had
visited
him
at
his
lodgings
some
who
came
to
the
tent
make
went
away
full
of
religion
he
would
now
let
a
dear
little
friend
of
his
tell
his
own
story
in
his
own
way
a
youngster
about
thirteen
was
introduced
to
the
audience
as
the
nephew
of
a
prominent
and
official
in
a
neighboring
town
it
was
afterwards
stated
by
the
way
that
the
official
in
question
had
not
a
nephew
in
the
world
no
doubt
the
youngster
imposed
on
mr
notext
if
ever
there
were
a
thoroughly
boy
this
youngster
was
one
or
as
may
be
very
possible
his
face
belied
him
atrociously
notext
placed
his
arm
dramatically
affectionately
rather
around
the
young
neck
and
led
him
to
the
front
of
the
platform
the
boy
looked
at
the
audience
with
a
leer
and
then
gave
his
experiences
glibly
in
a
very
harsh
treble
first
i
heard
that
rev
notext
was
going
to
get
up
a
revival
i
joked
about
it
with
other
boys
and
said
he
convert
me
and
the
night
of
the
first
meeting
i
said
to
the
other
boys
who
were
bad
boys
too
for
us
to
go
along
and
make
fun
and
so
we
did
and
i
came
to
laugh
at
notext
and
to
make
fun
and
somehow
i
know
how
it
was
i
got
religion
and
i
was
converted
and
now
i
am
very
happy
and
i
love
notext
and
i
am
going
with
him
to
smithersville
when
he
gets
through
here
and
i
am
very
happy
since
i
was
converted
and
became
a
good
sensation
among
the
audience
and
music
by
the
choir
in
response
to
call
another
juvenile
convert
was
brought
forward
he
repeated
substantially
the
same
story
as
his
predecessor
though
more
diffidently
more
music
by
the
choir
notext
now
told
the
affecting
story
of
little
jimmy
was
a
native
of
hindostan
he
lived
in
some
town
ending
in
there
was
in
that
town
a
missionary
school
master
was
a
very
bad
man
cruel
tyrannical
he
forbade
jimmy
to
go
to
the
but
jimmy
went
nevertheless
whenever
he
could
the
master
was
a
true
believer
in
the
national
religion
of
hindostan
he
believed
that
jimmy
would
go
to
perdition
if
he
left
his
ancestral
faith
to
embrace
the
national
religion
or
rather
the
governmental
religion
of
great
britain
jimmy
would
return
from
his
visits
to
the
in
a
very
happy
mood
singing
as
he
went
i
love
jesus
yes
i
love
jesus
i
know
i
know
i
do
etc
notext
gave
an
operatic
rendering
of
the
scene
of
jimmy
going
home
singing
the
above
words
one
day
the
master
heard
jimmy
and
was
roused
to
a
state
of
fury
he
forbade
the
boy
to
sing
the
song
but
jimmy
would
sing
it
notext
did
not
say
whether
jimmy
sang
the
hymn
in
english
or
hindostanee
then
the
brutal
master
took
an
enormous
cowhide
or
the
hindostanee
punitive
equivalent
thereto
and
belabored
poor
jimmy
but
jimmy
continued
to
sing
though
the
tears
rolled
down
his
cheeks
from
pain
and
the
master
flogged
and
jimmy
sang
and
still
the
master
flogged
and
flogged
and
still
jimmy
sang
and
sang
and
sang
it
was
like
the
famous
fight
in
arkansas
wherein
the
combatants
and
fit
and
but
there
must
be
an
end
of
everything
even
of
an
arkansas
fight
the
struggle
lasted
for
hours
exhausted
nature
finally
gave
way
and
poor
little
jimmy
died
under
the
lash
singing
with
his
last
breath
i
love
jesus
yes
i
love
jesus
i
know
i
know
i
my
friends
said
notext
want
you
all
to
stand
up
for
jesus
and
sing
poor
little
and
notext
led
off
the
choir
followed
his
example
but
the
audience
remained
seated
want
to
know
said
notext
rather
testily
many
christians
there
are
in
this
assembly
i
want
every
one
of
them
to
stand
up
several
persons
now
stood
up
and
gradually
the
action
began
to
spread
like
yawning
in
a
there
were
still
many
however
who
had
not
hearkened
to
summons
to
stand
up
he
called
attention
to
them
and
bade
some
of
the
brethren
go
to
them
and
talk
them
into
an
erect
position
some
of
the
recalcitrants
evidently
to
avoid
importunity
stood
up
the
rest
also
stood
up
and
hurriedly
left
the
tent
followed
by
an
angry
scowl
from
notext
after
a
little
hesitation
he
said
will
now
once
more
sing
little
and
when
the
hymn
was
sung
the
meeting
dispersed
next
morning
the
friendly
newspapers
chronicled
the
wonderful
success
of
efforts
the
number
of
converts
was
miraculously
large
two
thousand
persons
had
stood
up
for
jesus
the
meetings
were
continued
during
the
week
the
was
about
the
same
notext
repeated
himself
so
often
that
interest
began
to
languish
and
his
de
to
grow
flat
and
stale
when
he
was
at
a
loss
for
words
to
continue
one
of
his
disjointed
discourses
he
took
refuge
in
music
and
hymns
let
us
sing
to
jesus
come
to
jesus
come
to
jesus
just
now
etc
when
his
vulgar
and
often
unintentionally
blasphemous
exhortations
failed
to
hold
the
attention
of
his
hearers
and
morpheus
was
making
fight
against
him
in
sundry
corners
of
the
tent
he
would
suddenly
call
in
his
loudest
tones
on
all
present
to
stand
up
for
jesus
in
cases
of
very
marked
inattention
he
would
summon
his
hearers
and
particularly
the
children
to
write
down
their
names
for
jesus
in
a
large
book
kept
for
that
purpose
by
the
great
revivalist
this
stroke
generally
roused
the
audience
pretty
thoroughly
but
when
the
children
had
written
their
names
in
the
book
three
or
four
times
they
began
to
grow
tired
of
the
practice
thinking
that
if
these
writing
lessons
were
continued
they
might
as
well
be
at
school
in
the
beginning
of
the
second
week
there
were
unmistakable
signs
of
impending
collapse
the
revival
received
a
momentary
impulse
however
from
the
opposition
of
another
doctor
who
challenged
notext
to
controversy
this
aroused
the
natural
desire
to
witness
a
which
lives
in
the
human
heart
but
the
desire
was
not
gratified
owing
to
refusal
to
accept
the
challenge
his
failure
to
exhibit
a
proper
polemical
pugnacity
was
a
very
great
detriment
to
him
indeed
the
end
of
the
second
week
showed
a
marked
falling
off
in
the
number
of
persons
present
at
the
nightly
meetings
then
the
sinews
of
war
began
to
fail
the
weekly
wage
of
the
great
revivalist
could
not
be
raised
though
he
thrice
sent
back
best
in
all
the
congregations
to
make
additional
efforts
to
raise
the
stipulated

the
rev
notext
did
not
tarry
very
much
longer
in

he
had
barely
turned
his
back
upon
the
little
town
before
every
trace
of
the
tidal
wave
of
the
as
the
journals
called
it
had
disappeared
the
youthful
converts
had
gone
back
to
their
peg
tops
their
kites
and
their
china
alleys
and
alderman
charley
biggs
was
again
taking
his
in
the
way
the
message
the
message
so
far
as
it
deals
with
the
school
question
and
the
taxation
of
church
property
is
the
sequel
to
the
speech
which
he
delivered
at
des
moines
the
article
on
that
oration
which
appeared
in
our
last
number
was
to
some
extent
an
exposition
of
our
views
on
the
school
question
we
are
sure
that
those
views
when
carefully
examined
will
be
found
to
contain
the
only
solution
in
harmony
with
the
spirit
of
free
institutions
we
are
willing
to
submit
to
the
fairness
of
our
and
to
wait
until
time
and
thought
have
matured
their
judgment
on
the
following
questions
who
has
a
right
to
direct
the
education
of
children
their
parents
or
the
government
whether
in
a
republic
whose
form
of
government
depends
more
than
any
other
upon
the
virtue
of
its
citizens
it
is
better
to
have
moral
instruction
given
in
abundance
or
to
have
this
species
of
instruction
restricted
to
the
narrowest
limits
whether
it
is
the
design
of
a
free
government
to
legislate
for
all
or
whether
public
institutions
the
common
schools
for
instance
are
to
be
directed
only
for
the
benefit
of
certain
classes
whether
moneys
raised
by
taxation
for
the
common
good
should
not
be
so
applied
as
to
satisfy
the
conscientious
demands
of
all
citizens
whether
taxation
otherwise
directed
than
for
the
good
of
all
is
not
a
violation
of
the
maxim
without
representation
is
whether
catholics
have
or
have
not
shown
zeal
for
education
both
primary
and
scientific
whether
they
have
or
have
not
shed
their
blood
in
defence
of
the
nation
or
furnished
any
of
its
great
leaders
in
peace
and
war
whether
any
instance
can
be
shown
in
which
they
have
entered
or
inhabited
any
country
on
equal
terms
with
protestants
and
infidels
and
have
abused
their
power
to
hamper
or
persecute
their
whether
in
paying
their
taxes
and
supporting
their
own
schools
to
the
best
of
their
power
peacefully
discussing
the
question
of
public
welfare
and
their
own
rights
catholics
are
acting
as
loyal
citizens
or
as
factious
disturbers
of
and
kindly
feeling
among
neighbors
finally
whether
in
consideration
of
the
foregoing
our
views
are
not
entitled
to
respectful
consideration
we
have
no
doubt
whatever
that
when
the
thoughtful
and
just
men
of
our
day
and
race
have
duly
pondered
upon
these
subjects
we
shall
fully
agree
with
their
deliberate
reply
at
no
time
in
the
history
of
our
country
will
it
be
found
that
catholics
have
introduced
religion
into
the
arena
of
political
discussion
and
any
attempt
to
do
so
will
meet
with
failure
in
this
they
are
in
perfect
accord
with
the
principles
underlying
our
institutions
and
the
genuine
spirit
of
this
country
if
at
this
moment
the
rancor
of
ancient
bigotry
and
fanaticism
or
modern
hatred
of
christianity
has
attempted
to
awaken
a
political
conflict
on
religious
grounds
while
it
refuses
to
admit
a
calm
consideration
of
catholic
claims
we
appeal
from
philip
drunk
to
philip
sober
in
the
meantime
we
shall
assume
that
there
are
those
who
wish
to
hear
more
with
regard
to
our
principles
and
convictions
we
shall
endeavor
to
remove
all
obscurity
on
the
questions
now
under
discussion
and
to
reply
to
whatever
reasonable
objections
may
be
made
against
our
principles
with
regard
to
the
taxation
of
church
property
we
await
the
action
of
the
political
world
some
politicians
whose
is
of
that
kind
which
itself
would
introduce
this
question
into
political
discussion
in
order
to
draw
off
the
attention
of
the
american
people
from
the
real
present
issues
in
their
politics
we
ask
for
no
innovations
but
if
such
be
made
let
there
be
no
discrimination
we
stand
before
the
law
as
do
all
other
religious
denominations
us
have
were
the
memorable
words
spoken
at
a
memorable
time
by
a
man
who
to
a
large
extent
held
the
future
of
this
country
in
his
hands
those
words
held
and
hold
still
the
germs
of
the
wisest
policy
we
repeat
them
now
and
add
if
we
can
not
have
peace
let
us
at
least
have
fair
play
if
the
projectors
and
advocates
of
this
innovation
suppose
that
in
the
event
of
its
being
carried
out
they
will
thereby
worst
the
catholic
church
their
action
in
the
end
will
be
found
to
resemble
that
of
the
man
who
cut
off
his
nose
to
spite
his
neighbor
since
these
words
were
written
four
letters
have
appeared
in
the
new
york
under
the
heading
church
property
be
taxed
and
over
the
signature
of
george
andrews
the
writer
is
not
a
catholic
his
clear
concise
reasons
against
the
taxation
of
church
property
as
recommended
by
the
president
in
his
message
will
have
the
more
weight
with
readers
on
that
account
it
is
singular
yet
natural
to
see
how
his
argument
strengthens
our
own
position
on
the
question
in
a
number
of
ways
particularly
as
regards
the
suicidal
policy
of
many
who
through
hatred
or
fear
of
the
catholic
church
may
be
induced
to
commit
themselves
to
a
measure
which
would
prove
an
irreparable
mischief
to
their
own
church
or
churches
passing
by
the
many
able
and
suggestive
points
in
letters
we
take
just
such
as
more
immediately
bear
on
the
thoughts
thrown
out
by
ourselves
by
the
census
of
the
value
of
all
kinds
of
church
property
in
the
united
states
belonging
to
the
leading
denominations
was
placed
as
follows
methodist
roman
catholic
presbyterian
baptist
episcopalian
congregational
reformed
lutheran
unitarian
universalist
others
these
it
appears
says
andrews
the
relative
proportion
of
each
denomination
to
the
whole
is
substantially
as
follows
of
the
aggregate
roman
catholic
of
the
aggregate
presbyterian
of
the
aggregate
baptist
of
the
aggregate
episcopalian
of
the
aggregate
congregational
of
the
aggregate
reformed
of
the
aggregate
lutheran
of
the
aggregate
unitarian
of
the
aggregate
universalist
of
the
and
here
is
the
case
in
a
nutshell
me
it
seems
obvious
comments
andrews
on
reviewing
his
figures
the
expectation
is
that
those
who
belong
or
are
allied
to
other
sects
will
from
dislike
to
or
fear
of
the
roman
catholic
church
impose
a
burden
upon
it
even
if
in
doing
so
they
are
obliged
to
assume
an
equal
burden
themselves
or
in
other
words
that
the
owners
of
of
church
property
will
subject
it
to
taxation
in
order
to
impose
a
similar
tax
upon
the
owners
of
of
church
property
so
that
the
adherents
of
every
other
sect
at
variance
among
themselves
about
sundry
matters
of
doctrine
and
practice
essential
and
can
be
brought
to
act
in
concert
and
to
give
effect
to
a
common
spirit
of
hostility
to
roman
catholic
doctrine
to
roman
catholic
exclusiveness
roman
catholic
aggression
and
roman
catholic
influence
by
placing
a
tax
upon
roman
catholic
church
property
in
effect
arousing
a
spirit
of
persecution
qualified
by
the
condition
imposed
by
the
constitution
that
the
persecutor
must
share
in
the
penalty
he
may
succeed
in
imposing
upon
the
object
of
his
which
is
precisely
what
we
have
characterized
as
off
nose
to
spite
a
may
we
presume
to
ask
whether
the
taxation
of
church
property
will
reduce
the
expenses
of
the
general
government
render
its
officials
more
honest
and
purify
our
legislative
halls
these
are
the
duties
of
the
hour
here
are
the
issues
of
our
politics
but
a
profound
silence
regarding
them
reigns
in
the
official
utterance
are
the
projectors
of
the
new
policy
afraid
to
face
them
does
their
conscience
make
cowards
of
them
or
is
it
that
they
are
playing
the
part
of
the
up
to
this
period
the
state
and
all
religious
denominations
have
advanced
peaceably
to
prosperity
and
there
have
been
no
real
grounds
of
complaint
on
any
side
at
least
we
have
heard
of
none
publicly
what
then
has
brought
about
this
sudden
change
who
has
called
for
it
why
should
it
be
sprung
upon
us
at
this
moment
no
danger
threatens
from
this
quarter
there
is
not
visible
on
our
political
horizon
even
the
no
bigger
than
a
catholics
when
only
a
handful
never
dreamed
of
objecting
to
the
exemption
from
taxation
of
the
property
of
other
religious
denominations
or
to
the
aid
which
their
benevolent
institutions
received
can
it
be
the
rapid
development
of
catholicity
here
which
has
prompted
the
proposed
innovation
are
these
exemptions
which
have
been
handed
down
from
the
time
of
our
fathers
to
be
altered
because
catholicity
has
had
her
share
in
the
common
progress
let
truth
and
error
grapple
on
a
fair
and
open
field
is
there
fear
that
truth
will
be
worsted
in
the
struggle
if
the
exemption
of
church
property
from
taxation
be
so
great
an
evil
and
danger
to
the
country
those
whom
americans
generally
are
content
to
regard
as
their
great
statesmen
must
have
been
very
men
after
all
to
pass
by
one
after
another
so
glaring
an
evil
for
the
growth
of
church
property
is
not
a
thing
of
in
his
message
the
president
says
that
he
believes
that
the
church
property
of
the
united
states
which
paid
no
tax
municipal
or
state
amounted
to
about
million
dollars
in
the
amount
had
doubled
in
it
is
about
one
thousand
million
andrews
questions
the
estimate
for
on
the
ground
that
it
is
too
high
but
let
that
pass
the
following
table
given
by
andrews
shows
the
increase
in
value
according
to
the
census
of
the
property
of
the
ten
principal
churches
for
the
last
twenty
years
methodist
roman
catholic
presbyterian
baptist
episcopalian
congregational
reformed
lutheran
unitarian
universalist
the
gradation
it
will
be
seen
has
been
pretty
steady
and
is
comparatively
no
more
marked
in
than
it
was
in
or
than
it
was
probably
in
in
that
year
however
the
catholics
were
led
by
four
religious
bodies
and
almost
equalled
by
one
ten
years
later
they
stood
second
and
after
another
ten
years
second
still
surrounded
as
they
are
by
jealous
foes
they
offer
fair
game
therefore
to
men
in
search
of
political
prey
all
was
right
so
long
as
the
others
reaped
an
advantage
over
catholics
but
the
moment
there
appears
any
prospect
of
catholics
reaping
an
advantage
equally
with
the
rest
the
cry
is
the
country
is
in
danger
and
can
only
be
saved
by
taxing
church
property
who
so
blind
as
not
to
see
through
this
flimsy
pretext
not
andrews
certainly
and
no
words
of
ours
could
be
more
forcible
than
his
all
circumlocution
he
writes
is
as
well
to
get
down
at
once
to
the
bottom
fact
which
is
that
whatever
euphemistic
phrases
may
be
resorted
to
a
desire
to
obstruct
the
growth
and
circumscribe
the
influence
of
the
roman
catholic
church
gives
whatever
vitality
it
may
possess
to
the
proposition
to
tax
church
but
supposing
this
change
to
be
made
is
it
to
be
imagined
for
a
moment
that
the
progress
of
the
church
will
be
stopped
by
it
that
is
futile
if
though
so
few
in
numbers
and
at
a
great
disadvantage
the
church
was
able
to
raise
herself
to
her
present
position
if
when
the
exemptions
were
all
in
favor
of
other
denominations
catholics
were
able
to
make
so
great
a
progress
is
it
to
be
supposed
that
by
these
changes
and
by
placing
other
denominations
on
an
equality
with
catholics
the
advancement
of
the
catholic
church
is
to
be
retarded
we
have
been
trained
in
the
stern
school
of
poverty
we
are
accustomed
to
sacrifice
our
clergy
do
not
receive
high
salaries
the
personal
expenses
of
his
eminence
the
are
much
less
than
those
of
many
a
clerical
family
in
new
york
city
wherever
we
have
arms
to
work
with
the
church
of
god
shall
not
lack
all
that
is
necessary
to
give
it
dignity
even
if
we
have
to
pay
taxes
for
it
besides
in
ireland
the
priests
and
people
have
shared
their
crust
in
the
midst
of
the
famine
and
in
fear
of
death
until
within
a
few
years
in
germany
we
are
now
about
to
part
with
our
property
under
the
wicked
injustice
of
the
state
rather
than
submit
to
its
interference
in
the
affairs
of
conscience
is
any
person
foolish
enough
to
imagine
that
a
few
dollars
more
or
less
of
taxation
is
going
to
dishearten
or
frighten
us
if
you
want
to
make
our
people
more
liberal
if
you
want
to
see
grand
catholic
churches
and
the
cross
overtopping
roof
and
spire
in
every
city
just
put
us
on
our
mettle
persecution
is
our
legacy
martyrdom
is
our
life
the
cross
on
our
brows
is
no
empty
symbol
these
are
our
feelings
we
have
no
alarm
whatever
these
proposed
innovations
are
only
the
entrance
of
a
wedge
that
driven
home
will
disturb
the
foundations
of
our
government
will
create
religious
strife
and
blast
the
hopes
of
freedom
not
only
in
this
country
but
all
the
world
over
they
count
however
without
their
host
who
think
that
the
american
people
are
prepared
to
enter
on
such
a
career
and
the
politicians
who
hope
to
ride
into
power
by
awakening
the
spirit
of
fanaticism
and
religious
bigotry
among
us
if
their
names
be
held
in
memory
at
all
will
at
no
remote
period
be
pointed
out
with
the
finger
of
scorn
and
contumely
as
the
disturbers
of
that
peace
and
harmony
which
ought
always
to
reign
in
a
just
people
and
which
it
is
the
true
policy
of
all
government
and
the
duty
of
all
citizens
to
foster
and
maintain
we
say
nothing
at
the
present
regarding
the
unconstitutionality
of
these
proposed
innovations
and
of
the
secret
banding
together
of
men
to
carry
them
out
a
night
at
the
grande
chartreuse
from
the
french
of
it
is
near
midnight
i
am
alone
in
my
cell
awaiting
the
mysterious
guide
who
brought
me
hither
and
who
will
return
to
call
me
for
the
office
of
matins
i
listen
to
every
sound
seeking
to
understand
its
language
during
the
first
hour
i
still
heard
steps
from
time
to
time
in
the
distance
then
i
half
opened
my
door
and
looked
outside
at
the
end
of
the
cloister
a
white
figure
appeared
carrying
a
small
light
in
its
hand
it
approached
at
a
slow
pace
stopped
near
a
pillar
and
disappeared
under
the
arches
sometimes
i
have
seen
other
shadows
pass
along
and
have
heard
a
few
words
bells
which
answered
each
other
then
little
by
little
everything
is
extinguished
and
there
is
not
another
sound
another
breath
but
still
i
listen
and
can
not
cease
to
listen
is
it
indeed
myself
who
am
in
this
monastery
was
i
only
yet
in
the
midst
of
the
living
can
one
single
day
comprise
so
many
things
this
which
is
just
ending
has
been
so
full
so
strange
that
i
can
not
well
recount
all
that
has
happened
in
it
and
yet
it
was
but
this
morning
that
i
was
at
aix
in
the
midst
of
light
and
noise
and
the
children
were
gambolling
around
me
all
at
once
some
one
said
we
go
to
the
grande
chartreuse
it
was
said
just
as
one
would
say
anything
else
we
set
out
as
if
for
an
ordinary
excursion
a
party
of
pleasure
mme
b
had
provisions
in
readiness
which
were
increased
by
the
additions
of
other
members
of
the
party
and
we
start
in
the
midst
of
lively
speeches
and
merriment
so
long
as
we
proceed
along
the
valley
this
is
all
very
well
the
road
rises
and
descends
running
through
the
vineyards
skirting
the
rocks
while
the
warm
breath
of
the
south
gently
moves
the
surrounding
verdure
then
after
piercing
the
flank
of
the
mountain
it
slopes
down
toward
the
plains
of
dauphine
discovering
a
horizon
all
bathed
in
light
it
is
after
passing
saint
laurent
at
the
foot
of
the
and
in
perceiving
the
entrance
of
the
gorge
that
one
begins
to
understand
something
more
it
is
then
that
jesting
is
silenced
and
gayety
grows
grave
then
on
arriving
at
the
we
become
altogether
dumb
already
we
had
ceased
to
laugh
we
now
ceased
to
speak
but
regarded
with
a
sort
of
stupefaction
this
road
without
issue
which
seemed
to
end
in
chaos
the
mountains
rose
defiantly
before
us
overlapping
and
mingling
with
each
other
and
here
and
there
barring
the
way
with
huge
masses
of
precipitous
rock
the
gigantic
trees
seem
to
rise
to
the
clouds
and
torrents
from
unknown
heights
fall
as
if
from
heaven
while
the
rocks
crowd
upon
before
around
and
seem
to
say
farther
shall
you
as
we
come
to
a
turn
it
seems
as
if
all
progress
were
indeed
at
an
end
two
immense
blocks
fallen
across
each
other
completely
close
the
we
approach
them
however
and
it
opens
again
the
rocks
forming
a
sort
of
titanic
vaulted
roof
overhead
and
falling
again
in
the
form
of
three
bridges
one
above
the
other
the
horses
continuing
to
climb
a
road
which
the
eye
can
not
take
in
and
whilst
one
is
lost
in
these
abysses
what
a
perfect
dream
of
splendor
begins
to
break
overhead
meadows
of
the
most
exquisite
green
seem
as
if
suspended
far
above
us
silvery
rocks
jutting
out
from
among
their
black
firs
gigantic
oaks
grasping
the
heights
of
the
precipices
their
crowns
of
verdure
glittering
in
the
it
is
a
fantastic
apparition
one
has
visions
in
childhood
of
unknown
regions
of
enchanted
forests
guarded
by
genii
but
one
never
thought
to
contemplate
these
marvels
in
reality
then
all
at
once
the
mountains
separate
the
torrents
disappear
and
in
the
midst
of
a
gorge
rise
battlements
and
it
is
the
monastery
there
it
stands
guarded
by
these
lofty
sentinels
in
this
sombre
amphitheatre
which
would
be
desolation
itself
if
god
had
not
scattered
there
all
the
magical
beauties
of
his
creation
there
is
not
a
village
not
a
cottage
not
a
wayfarer
nothing
there
is
la
chartreuse
no
solitude
can
be
compared
to
that
on
the
summit
of
bernard
and
of
the
simplon
monasteries
destined
for
the
relief
of
travellers
present
themselves
to
the
passage
of
the
nations
in
the
sandy
deserts
the
most
isolated
convents
find
themselves
in
the
road
of
the
caravans
but
here
this
road
conducts
to
nothing
it
is
a
silent
gorge
it
is
the
valley
of
contemplation
it
is
the
greatest
solitude
that
one
can
imagine
and
when
from
those
heights
one
has
seen
the
gradual
approach
of
night
seen
these
masses
of
rock
and
of
verdure
enfolded
in
the
vast
shadows
and
at
the
summons
of
the
monastery
bell
has
seen
the
last
of
the
white
robes
descend
from
the
mountain
he
feels
that
it
is
one
of
those
moments
in
a
life
which
will
never
be
forgotten
then
after
having
stayed
awhile
to
contemplate
this
scene
i
rose
and
came
to
knock
at
this
door
which
has
been
to
so
many
others
as
the
gate
of
the
a
carthusian
monk
brought
me
to
my
cell
went
his
way
in
silence
and
since
then
i
have
been
left
to
my
reflections
there
are
then
men
who
in
the
morning
were
in
their
homes
in
the
midst
of
their
friends
in
life
and
stir
and
the
noise
of
the
outer
they
have
climbed
this
mountain
they
have
sought
this
have
knocked
at
this
gate
it
has
closed
upon
them
and
for
ever
they
have
as
i
sat
down
at
this
table
they
have
gazed
at
the
walls
of
their
cell
and
have
said
to
themselves
henceforth
my
then
they
have
heard
the
sound
of
these
bells
the
echo
of
these
litanies
and
they
have
said
to
themselves
shall
henceforth
hear
no
other
you
see
one
reads
these
things
in
the
works
of
poets
one
sees
them
represented
in
the
drama
but
one
must
find
self
actually
in
a
real
cell
and
one
must
sleep
there
to
conceive
anything
of
the
reality
of
a
monastic
life
to
awake
here
in
the
morning
to
rise
and
eat
alone
the
food
which
comes
to
you
through
a
little
wicket
like
that
of
a
prisoner
to
meet
when
one
traverses
the
cloister
other
shadows
who
salute
you
in
silence
to
go
from
the
church
to
the
cell
from
the
cell
to
the
church
and
to
say
to
self
that
it
is
always
and
always
to
be
the
same
always
all
through
life
or
rather
there
is
no
more
life
no
more
space
no
more
time
it
is
the
beginning
of
eternity
one
is
on
the
threshold
of
the
infinite
and
it
seems
as
if
all
this
nature
had
only
been
created
to
give
these
men
a
beginning
of
eternal
repose
always
alone
the
thought
crushes
one
no
more
to
receive
anything
from
without
to
nourish
self
with
spiritualities
alone
to
meditate
contemplate
and
pray
to
pray
always
to
pray
for
those
who
never
pray
themselves
to
pray
for
those
who
have
shattered
your
life
and
who
may
be
have
led
you
hither
to
pray
for
those
who
have
despoiled
your
monastery
and
outraged
your
habit
even
for
the
impious
ones
who
come
to
insult
you
in
your
very
hospitality
and
for
all
this
one
thing
alone
suffices
faith
a
bell
has
rung
it
is
the
hour
of
matins
some
one
knocks
at
my
door
i
open
and
they
conduct
me
to
the
little
stall
reserved
for
travellers
at
first
the
obscurity
is
so
great
that
it
is
difficult
to
distinguish
anything
the
church
is
empty
and
none
of
the
tapers
are
lighted
then
a
door
opens
in
the
distance
and
the
monks
enter
in
procession
each
holding
a
long
of
which
the
slanting
gleams
dimly
lessen
the
darkness
of
the
chapel
they
repair
to
their
stalls
and
the
office
begins
it
consists
principally
of
a
monotonous
psalmody
of
an
implacable
rhythm
of
which
one
scarcely
perceives
the
first
murmurs
and
which
seems
as
if
it
would
never
end
i
gaze
at
these
tall
white
figures
these
motionless
what
has
been
the
drama
of
life
to
each
one
what
changes
without
and
within
have
led
them
there
what
have
they
suffered
and
do
they
suffer
still
what
has
the
rule
of
their
order
done
for
them
and
still
the
psalmody
goes
on
at
times
they
rise
uttering
what
seems
to
be
a
sort
of
lamentation
then
they
fall
prostrate
with
their
arms
stretched
out
before
them
all
the
lights
disappear
there
is
nothing
but
darkness
and
silence
it
seems
as
if
man
himself
were
extinguished
after
which
the
lights
reappear
the
psalmody
recommences
and
thus
it
continues
when
the
rising
sun
shone
upon
the
summits
of
the
rocks
i
rose
from
my
pallet
exclaiming
light
at
last
hail
to
the
light
i
open
my
window
and
look
there
is
no
other
place
like
this
such
as
it
was
in
the
night
such
is
it
in
the
day
in
vain
may
the
sun
mount
above
the
horizon
to
bring
warmth
into
this
gorge
the
monastery
remains
cold
and
as
it
were
insensible
in
vain
his
rays
dart
upon
the
walls
glitter
on
the
spires
and
set
the
rocks
on
there
are
living
men
but
one
does
not
see
them
one
does
not
hear
them
only
a
wagon
drawn
by
oxen
crosses
the
meadow
followed
by
a
monk
and
some
beggars
are
approaching
the
monastery
gate
then
without
guide
or
direction
i
plunge
into
the
forest
in
search
of
the
chapel
of
bruno
this
forest
is
of
incomparable
beauty
neither
switzerland
nor
the
pyrenees
contain
anything
like
it
prodigious
trees
rise
to
an
immense
height
wrapping
their
gigantic
roots
about
the
rocks
in
the
midst
of
the
waters
which
murmur
on
every
side
unknown
vegetations
luxuriate
sheltering
at
their
feet
a
world
of
ferns
tall
grass
and
mosses
every
dewy
feather
and
spray
being
hung
as
it
were
with
precious
stones
upon
which
the
sun
darts
here
and
there
rays
of
gold
and
touches
of
fire
there
is
here
a
wild
enchantment
which
neither
pen
nor
pencil
ever
can
depict
and
in
the
midst
of
these
marvels
rises
from
a
rock
the
chapel
of
bruno
there
it
was
that
the
visions
appeared
to
him
and
there
he
caused
a
spring
of
water
to
flow
forth
but
to
me
the
most
wonderful
of
all
the
miracles
of
his
legend
was
that
of
his
getting
there
at
all
the
fact
of
his
reaching
the
foot
of
this
desert
hatchet
in
hand
cutting
down
the
trees
which
barred
his
entrance
wrestling
with
wild
animals
the
masters
of
this
forest
and
having
no
other
pathway
than
the
bed
ever
mounting
upwards
in
spite
of
the
streams
in
spite
of
the
rocks
in
spite
of
everything
never
finding
himself
lost
enough
but
ever
struggling
higher
and
higher
still
the
miracle
is
too
that
of
his
having
fixed
himself
at
last
upon
that
spot
and
to
have
called
companions
around
him
who
constructed
each
his
little
hermitage
about
his
own
that
of
having
in
name
taken
possession
of
these
inaccessible
mountains
all
of
which
are
surmounted
by
a
cross
and
to
have
founded
an
order
which
spread
itself
over
the
whole
christian
world
and
which
is
still
existing
but
the
hour
of
departure
has
arrived
at
the
moment
of
quitting
this
solitude
we
again
reflect
france
and
italy
lie
spread
out
beneath
our
feet
that
is
to
say
passions
hatred
why
should
we
descend
again
why
resume
the
burden
of
ambitions
rivalries
the
harness
of
social
conventionalities
to
what
purpose
is
it
since
the
end
at
last
must
come
alike
to
all
we
look
around
we
reflect
and
then
after
having
well
meditated
we
all
descend
at
the
foot
of
the
desert
we
find
again
huts
then
cottages
by
and
by
a
village
with
movement
and
life
we
find
our
speech
again
and
with
speech
discussion
overwhelmed
until
then
by
the
wild
beauty
of
all
around
us
and
by
the
majesty
of
its
silence
the
sceptics
only
now
recommence
the
criticisms
which
were
cut
short
the
evening
before
services
do
these
monks
render
to
mankind
to
what
purpose
do
they
bury
themselves
upon
those
heights
when
there
is
so
much
to
be
done
below
i
answer
nothing
these
are
difficult
questions
later
we
shall
know
which
has
chosen
the
better
part
those
who
act
or
those
who
pray
only
i
remember
that
whilst
thirty
thousand
israelites
were
fighting
in
the
plain
moses
alone
on
the
mountain
with
his
arms
stretched
out
towards
heaven
implored
the
god
of
armies
when
his
arms
fell
through
weariness
the
amalekites
prevailed
and
when
he
raised
them
israel
was
victorious
and
seeing
this
he
caused
his
arms
to
be
supported
until
the
enemies
of
israel
were
overcome
while
we
are
debating
we
cross
saint
laurent
les
echelles
and
the
valley
du
guiers
here
is
chambéry
with
its
flags
its
concourse
of
and
bands
of
music
but
although
we
have
returned
to
outer
life
we
have
brought
away
with
us
something
of
the
solitude
we
have
left
where
it
seems
as
if
the
earth
ended
believe
me
reader
and
do
not
forget
my
words
when
you
visit
these
lands
the
sight
of
la
grande
chartreuse
is
one
of
the
most
powerful
emotions
here
below
to
whatever
religion
you
may
belong
if
your
soul
can
be
moved
by
the
thought
of
the
life
to
come
you
will
preserve
an
imperishable
remembrance
of
a
night
spent
in
this
monastery
and
will
feel
that
you
are
not
altogether
the
same
man
that
you
were
when
you
entered

plon
the
author
of
this
volume
has
read
carefully
and
seriously
a
large
number
of
works
by
different
american
french
and
english
writers
devoted
to
an
explanation
of
the
institutions
of
the
united
states
and
to
the
history
and
social
condition
of
the
country
he
shows
also
a
remarkable
acquaintance
with
the
magazines
and
newspapers
of
the
united
states
so
far
as
they
bear
on
the
subjects
of
which
he
treats
his
book
indeed
must
have
cost
him
years
of
assiduous
labor
jannet
gives
a
just
and
impartial
exposition
of
the
laws
and
political
principles
of
our
country
as
also
of
its
present
social
condition
rarely
if
ever
has
a
foreigner
displayed
so
conscientious
a
study
of
all
that
goes
to
make
up
american
civilization
he
professes
to
have
entered
upon
his
study
and
his
work
without
any
preconceived
theory
a
profession
not
unusual
with
authors
and
for
the
most
part
probably
honestly
made
it
is
one
thing
however
to
profess
another
thing
to
adhere
to
the
profession
were
it
possible
for
authors
to
adhere
strictly
to
the
profession
made
by
jannet
literature
and
all
of
which
it
treats
would
certainly
not
suffer
therefrom
but
he
who
imagines
he
has
attained
to
so
just
and
fair
a
position
is
the
least
free
from
illusion
the
position
is
simply
unattainable
and
jannet
is
scarcely
to
be
blamed
if
he
has
not
quite
reached
his
ideal
two
classes
of
authors
have
written
about
the
united
states
the
one
sees
almost
everything
in
de
the
other
in
a
sombre
hue
jannet
belongs
to
the
latter
class
throughout
his
volume
he
fastens
upon
every
symptom
that
threatens
the
existence
or
the
welfare
of
the
republic
as
an
enumeration
of
these
symptoms
it
is
exact
and
its
perusal
would
do
no
harm
to
our
orators
jannet
has
evidently
aimed
at
counterbalancing
the
influence
of
writers
french
writers
particularly
who
have
exaggerated
the
good
side
of
american
political
society
he
seems
fearful
lest
their
tone
of
thought
should
have
too
great
a
preponderance
in
france
and
influence
its
present
too
powerfully
in
the
direction
of
the
united
states
whether
or
not
this
was
called
for
is
not
a
question
for
us
to
consider
the
book
regarded
as
an
impartial
exposition
of
the
present
condition
of
the
united
states
resembles
the
picture
of
an
artist
the
background
of
which
is
painted
with
a
preraphaelite
exactness
while
the
foreground
is
left
unfinished
and
the
whole
work
consequently
incomplete
had
the
obvious
purpose
of
the
book
been
proclaimed
at
the
beginning
we
should
have
read
it
with
a
more
favorable
eye
in
his
last
chapter
however
jannet
holds
out
some
hope
for
the
future
of
the
american
republic
in
our
present
commercial
depression
in
the
recent
success
of
the
democratic
party
in
the
number
of
families
who
have
preserved
the
primitive
virtues
and
customs
of
our
forefathers
and
in
the
progress
of
catholicity
he
sees
a
ground
for
this
hope
and
concludes
his
work
by
saying
are
everywhere
prosperous
or
unfortunate
according
as
they
observe
or
despise
the
divine
law
all
their
free
will
consists
in
choosing
between
these
two
terms
of
the
problem
of
life
and
all
the
efforts
of
the
spirit
of
innovation
only
break
against
without
ever
being
able
to
destroy
the
eternal
bounds
set
by
god
to
the
ambitious
feebleness
of
the
creature
therein
lies
the
lesson
that
the
young
republic
of
the
new
world
sends
from
beyond
the
ocean
and
across
the
mirage
of
its
rapid
prosperity
to
the
old
nations
of
europe
too
inclined
to
believe
in
the
sophisms
of
the
great
modern
error
and
to
mistrust
their
own
work
is
worthy
of
a
more
extended
notice
which
will
be
given
it

a
later
date

awards
a

high
meed
of
praise
to
father
work
so
far
as
it
is
as
yet
given
to
the
public
it
is
likely
to
become
extensive
when
fully
completed
since
the
present
volume
is
filled
up
with
the
introductory
remarks
on
the
missionary
life
of
our
lord
and
the
exposition
of
one
portion
of
the
sermon
on
the
mount
to
wit
the
beatitudes
it
is
a
work
which
is
strictly
speaking
in
our
language
and
indeed
in
all
modern
literature
and
one
hard
to
describe
in
such
a
way
as
to
give
an
accurate
notion
of
its
quality
and
scope
to
a
person
who
has
not
read
some
portion
of
its
contents
the
author
has
drawn
from
the
most
various
and
from
the
purest
sources
and
has
himself
meditated
in
a
very
attentive
and
minute
manner
upon
the
rich
materials
furnished
him
by
the
sacred
lore
of
his
studies
he
proceeds
leisurely
quietly
carefully
like
the
patient
illuminator
of
a
manuscript
text
filling
his
pages
with
large
and
small
figures
all
elaborately
finished
the
present
volume
gives
us
a
sketch
of
galilee
the
scene
of
the
preaching
and
miracles
of
our
divine
redeemer
during
his
first
year
of
public
ministry
which
makes
at
once
the
idea
of
that
ministry
of
its
extraordinary
laboriousness
its
extent
and
the
multitude
of
wonderful
works
comprehended
within
its
brief
period
ten
times
more
vivid
than
it
can
be
made
by
a
mere
perusal
of
the
gospel
narrative
in
this
respect
it
is
especially
interesting
and
instructive
for
those
who
are
themselves
engaged
in
missionary
labors
we
have
a
picture
placed
before
our
minds
of
the
real
nature
of
our
public
life
and
ministry
and
grouped
around
it
are
other
pictures
as
illustrations
from
the
lives
of
the
great
missionary
saints
when
the
author
approaches
to
his
principal
theme
in
this
volume
the
sermon
on
the
mount
he
makes
the
whole
scene
and
all
its
circumstances
appear
before
us
like
a
fine
dioramic
view
he
is
not
however
of
that
meretricious
school
to
which
renan
and
beecher
have
given
a
false
and
momentary
as
unworthy
of
the
divine
subject
as
the
homage
of
another
class
of
witnesses
on
whom
our
lord
frequently
imposed
silence
the
poetic
literary
and
picturesque
charms
of
father
style
are
subservient
to
his
theological
doctrinal
and
moral
exposition
of
sacred
truths
it
is
the
pure
doctrine
of
the
scriptures
and
of
the
fathers
doctors
and
saints
of
the
church
which
we
are
invited
and
allured
to
drink
from
the
ornamented
chalice

holy
ways

the

or
a
short
treatise
on
the
various
trials

this
little

purports
to
be
a
simple
sketch
of
the
life
of
the
prince
of
the
apostles
it
will
serve
to
recall
the
principal
events
in

life
and
therefore
will
possess
a
certain
amount
of
interest
for
catholic

the

are
neat

elegant
the
object
of
the
book
is
evidently
pious
and
therefore
we
shrink
from
criticising
it
too
minutely
the
style
also
is
pleasing
and
readable
it
is
to
be
regretted
however
that
the
author
did
not
take
a
little
more
pains
with
his
task
it
is
a
good
thing
to
have
plenty
of
books
on
catholic
subjects
and
those
who
are
gifted
with
power
and
who
can
command
the
leisure
are
to
a

extent
bound

they
are
also
bound

consistency

order

in
sending
forth
their
productions
to
show
a
proper
respect
for
those

buy
them
does
not
excuse
slovenliness
and
we
heartily
wish
that
had
shown
a
deeper
sense
of
this
truth
the
fact
that
a

is
small

not
free
the

from
a
thorough
analysis
of
his

the

die
as
of

we
scarcely

almost
forgotten

to

raged

were
relieved
by

of

a
treaty
of
peace
was
signed
in

which

we
may
hope
that
the
soil
which
has
drunk
the
blood
of
so
many
martyrs
will
yet
become
the
vineyard

but
we
must
refer
our
readers
to
the
book
itself
and
close
this
brief
notice
with
the
wish
that
some
one
of

it
is
refreshing
in
these
days
to
meet
with
a
writer
like
dix
who
takes
his
stand
on
christianity
and
the
law
of
christ
as
the
foundation
of
all
right
law
and
government
there
is
a
class
and
a
large
class
of
patriots
among
us
who
seem
unconsciously
indeed
to
resent
the
idea
that
almighty
god
had
anything
at
all
to
do
with
the
growth
and
development
of
this
country
to
this
class
of
men
book
will
be
a
sharp
reminder
that
there
is
a
god
above
us
who
rules
all
things
and
that
religion
and
governments
did
actually
exist
in
the
world
at
large
and
in
the
new
world
for
the
matter
of
that
before
the
touched
these
shores
the
book
deals
with
just
what
its
title
indicates
the
american
state
and
american
statesmen
among
the
statesmen
dealt
with
are
abraham
lincoln
charles
sumner
and
several
of
the
historic
names
that
have
lent
a
lustre
to
congress
but
the
larger
and
graver
portion
of
the
book
deals
with
the
constitution
of
the
states
in
themselves
and
their
relation
to
the
states
as
a
whole
or
nation
dix
is
a
strong
and
earnest
advocate
for
his
views
but
his
views
in
the
present
matter
are
almost
diametrically
opposed
to
the
general
feeling
of
americans
the
united
states
a
nation
he
boldly
asks
in
the
final
chapter
of
the
book
and
his
answer
is
and
in
a
word
he
is
strongly
in
favor
of
the
centralization
of
sovereignty
as
opposed
to
the
local
independence
of
states
as
long
as
federalism
exists
says
dix
practically
so
long
is
the
nation
exposed
to
disorder
and
a
renewal
of
the
civil
war
so
important
a
question
it
is
needless
to
remark
is
scarcely
to
be
settled
in
a
is
indeed
beyond
books
altogether
it
is
a
growth
the
country
and
government
alike
are
a
growth
and
a
growth
that
will
not
be
forced
they
are
just
entering
on
the
hundredth
year
of
a
life
that
has
been
seriously
threatened
and
notwithstanding
the
theatrical
thunder
which
is
being
heard
just
now
of
politicians
resolved
to
make
hit
we
can
not
but
look
to
the
development
of
this
growth
with
hope
and
confidence
at
the
same
time
it
is
the
part
of
all
who
are
concerned
to
guard
that
growth
well
to
see
that
no
weeds
spring
up
around
it
to
let
in
light
and
air
and
freedom
and
to
keep
off
all
noxious
influences
that
would
threaten
the
life
of
the
parent
stem
in
the
desire
to
do
this
such
chapters
as
the
inspirer
of
nations
the
curse
of
america
and
a
christian
power
which
seem
to
us
the
strongest
chapters
in
book
will
be
found
full
of
eloquent
suggestion
and
sound
even
solemn
advice
the
book
as
a
whole
will
be
found
a
very
interesting
one
the
writer
is
a
bold
man
who
certainly
has
the
courage
of
his
convictions
which
he
never
hesitates
to
express
openly
the
book
overruns
with
apt
illustration
and
an
extraordinary
eloquence
indeed
there
is
a
fault
in
parts
of
too
great
eloquence

over

upon
the
merits
of
the
series
in
turning
over
the
leaves
of
a
college
sheet
the
other
day
we
came
upon
an
extract
from
the
letter
of
a
young
lady
at
one
of
our
fashionable
seminaries
in
which
counselling
her
sisters
to
high
resolves
and
noble
aims
she
says
of
getting
a
new
hat
this
term
let
us
buy
a
we
think
this
is
good
evidence
of
the
value
of
these
volumes
as
literary
works
they
are
admirably
suited
for
misses
but
what
the
authors
and
scholars
who
are
gossiped
about
would
say
at
being
brought
down
to
this
level
is
another
question
on
the
whole
we
would
advise
this
young
lady
to
buy
a
new
hat
instead
the
hat
will
serve
a
useful
if
not
a
very
exalted
purpose
in
covering
her
head
the
will
fill
it
with
frivolous
and
untrustworthy
this
volume
treats
under
distinct
heads
of
persons
including
a
majority
of
the
poets
novelists
historians
linguistic
scholars
and
essayists
of
scotland
at
the
beginning
of
this
century
with
a
sprinkling
of
english
and
german
including
goethe
in
a
little
over
three
hundred
small
duodecimo
pages
that
is
to
say
it
gives
an
average
of
seven
pages
to
each
author
these
seven
pages
are
devoted
almost
exclusively
in
each
instance
to
trivial
personal
anecdotes
from
this
simple
inventory
therefore
it
will
be
easy
to
form
an
accurate
notion
of
what
the
young
lady
gains
mentally
as
an
equivalent
for
the
loss
of
her
new
hat
considerable
space
is
given
however
to
one
or
two
worthies
of
these
william
godwin
the
revolutionary
propagandist
holds
the
first
place
and
with
him
incidentally
his
first
wife
mary
wollstonecraft
the
author
of
the
of
the
rights
of
this
precious
pair
are
handled
with
great
tenderness
and
unction
the
rest
of
the
volume
is
made
up
chiefly
of
reminiscences
of
the
small
literary
stars
who
twinkled
round
sir
walter
scott
in
edinburgh
at
the
beginning
of
the
century
and
stole
something
from

in
the

of
young
people
some
of
the

as
might
be

with
as
much

as
amusement
by
persons
especially
those
who
are
continually
complaining

office
of
the

at
washington
a
sequel
of
the
gladstone
controversy
ii
one
of
the
most
mischievous
prejudices
of
our
day
is
the
popular
theory
that
the
cure
for
all
evils
is
to
be
sought
in
the
intellectual
education
of
the
masses
those
nations
we
are
told
by
every
declaimer
in
which
the
education
of
the
people
is
most
universal
are
the
most
moral
the
richest
the
strongest
the
freest
and
their
prosperity
rests
upon
the
most
solid
and
lasting
foundation
make
ignorance
a
crime
teach
all
to
read
and
write
and
war
will
smooth
its
rugged
front
armies
will
be
disbanded
crime
will
disappear
and
mankind
will
have
found
the
secret
of
uninterrupted
progress
the
final
outcome
of
which
will
surpass
even
our
fondest
dreams
this
fallacy
which
has
not
even
the
merit
of
being
plausible
is
of
course
made
to
do
service
in
de
pamphlet
on
the
comparative
bearing
of
protestantism
and
catholicism
on
the
prosperity
of
nations
is
now
universally
admitted
he
informs
us
the
diffusion
of
enlightenment
is
the
first
condition
of
the
general
spread
of
education
is
also
indispensable
to
the
exercise
of
constitutional
in
short
education
is
the
basis
of
national
liberty
and
he
then
goes
on
to
declare
that
in
this
matter
of
popular
education
protestant
countries
are
far
in
advance
of
those
that
are
catholic
that
this
is
necessarily
so
since
reformed
religion
rests
on
a
book
the
bible
the
protestant
therefore
must
know
how
to
read
catholic
worship
on
the
contrary
rests
upon
sacraments
and
certain
practices
such
as
confession
masses
sermons
which
do
not
necessarily
involve
reading
it
is
therefore
unnecessary
to
know
how
to
read
indeed
it
is
dangerous
for
it
inevitably
shakes
the
principle
of
passive
obedience
on
which
the
whole
catholic
edifice
reposes
reading
is
the
road
that
leads
to
we
will
first
consider
the
theory
and
then
take
up
the
facts
diffusion
of
enlightenment
is
the
first
condition
of
progress
education
is
indispensable
to
the
exercise
of
constitutional
liberty
education
is
the
basis
of
national
liberty
and
enlightenment
is
of
course
of
the
mind
and
means
the
development
more
or
less
perfect
of
the
intellectual
faculties
and
education
since
it
is
here
considered
as
synonymous
with
enlightenment
must
be
taken
in
this
narrow
sense
progress
is
material
moral
intellectual
social
political
artistic
religious
scientific
literary
and
indefinitely
manifold
now
it
is
assumed
that
the
diffusion
of
enlightenment
is
not
merely
promotive
but
that
it
is
an
essential
condition
of
progress
in
its
widest
and
fullest
meaning
this
is
the
new
faith
the
goddess
of
culture
holding
the
torch
of
science
and
leading
mankind
into
the
palace
of
pleasure
the
only
true
heaven
by
conduct
we
have
already
said
both
individuals
and
nations
are
saved
or
perish
and
we
spoke
of
the
civilized
barbarous
states
are
destroyed
by
catastrophes
they
die
a
violent
death
but
the
civilized
are
wasted
by
internal
maladies
et
ipsa
roma
viribus
they
grow
and
they
decay
they
progress
and
they
decline
at
first
poverty
virtue
industry
faith
hopefulness
strong
characters
and
heroic
natures
at
last
wealth
corruption
indolence
unbelief
despair
children
too
weak
even
to
admire
the
strength
of
their
fathers
too
base
to
believe
that
they
were
noble
public
spirit
dies
out
patriotism
is
in
the
mouths
of
politicians
but
like
the
augurs
of
rome
they
can
not
speak
the
word
and
look
one
another
in
the
face
the
country
is
to
each
one
what
he
can
make
out
of
it
and
the
bond
of
union
is
the
desire
of
each
citizen
to
secure
his
own
interests
the
bondholders
love
their
country
and
the
are
disloyal
class
rises
against
class
civil
discord
unsettles
everything
revolution
succeeds
revolution
and
when
the
barbarian
comes
he
holds
an
inquest
over
the
corpse
it
generally
happens
too
that
those
civilizations
which
spring
up
quickest
and
promise
most
fair
are
fated
to
die
earliest
as
precocious
children
disappoint
fond
mothers
if
the
teaching
of
history
is
a
trustworthy
guide
we
are
certainly
safe
in
affirming
that
civilized
states
and
empires
perish
not
from
lack
of
knowledge
but
of
virtue
not
because
the
people
are
ignorant
but
because
they
are
corrupt
the
assumption
however
is
that
men
become
immoral
because
they
are
ignorant
that
if
they
were
enlightened
they
would
be
virtuous
superstition
says
herbert
spencer
of
good
behavior
is
to
be
forthwith
produced
by
lessons
learned
out
of
books
which
was
long
ago
statistically
disproved
would
but
for
preconceptions
be
utterly
dissipated
by
observing
to
what
a
slight
extent
knowledge
affects
conduct
by
observing
that
the
dishonesty
implied
in
the
adulterations
of
tradesmen
and
manufacturers
in
fraudulent
bankruptcies
in
in
of
railway
accounts
and
financial
prospectuses
differs
only
in
form
and
not
in
amount
from
the
dishonesty
of
the
uneducated
by
observing
how
amazingly
little
the
teachings
given
to
medical
students
affect
their
lives
and
how
even
the
most
experienced
medical
men
have
their
prudence
scarcely
at
all
increased
by
their
it
is
not
knowledge
but
character
that
is
important
and
character
is
formed
more
by
faith
by
hope
by
love
admiration
enthusiasm
reverence
than
by
any
patchwork
of
alphabetical
and
arithmetical
symbols
the
young
know
but
little
but
they
believe
firmly
they
hope
nobly
and
love
generously
and
it
is
while
knowledge
is
feeble
and
these
spontaneous
acts
of
the
soul
are
strong
that
character
is
moulded
the
curse
of
our
age
is
that
men
will
believe
that
in
education
to
spell
to
read
to
write
is
what
signifies
and
they
cast
aside
the
eternal
faith
the
infinite
hope
the
divine
love
that
more
than
all
else
make
us
men
true
test

emerson
not

nor

the
kind
of

the
country
turns

there
some
mystic

in

that
to
be
able
to
read
them
should
make
us
men
and
even
in
the
most
enlightened
countries
what
do
the
masses
of
men
know
next
to
nothing
and
their

for
the

part
stupefies
them
the

its

startling

upon

any

system
the

false
it

none

or
there

what
children
know
when
they
leave

is
mechanical
external
to
their
minds
fitted
on
them
like

on

and
it
is
soon
worn
threadbare
and
hangs
in

and

take
the
first
boy
whom
you
meet
fourteen
or
fifteen
years
old
fresh
from
the
common
school
and
his
ignorance
of
all
real
knowledge
will
surprise
you
what
he
knows
is
little
and
of
small
value
what
is
of
moment
is
whether
he
believes
firmly
hopes
strongly
and
loves

the

of

do
we
want
so
much
but
the
diffusion
of

of
honest
faith
and
manly
courage
man
is
more
than
his
knowledge
simple
faith
is
better
than
reading
and
writing
and
yet
the
educational
quacks
treat
the
child
as
though
he
were
mere
mind
and
his
sole
business
to
use
it
and
chiefly
for
low
ends
shrewdly
and
sharply
with
a
view
to
profit
as
though
life
were
a
thing
of

and
wisdom
the
art
of
making
the
most
of
it
poor
child
who
wouldst
live
by
admiration
hope
and
love
how
they
dwarf
thy
being
stunt
thy
growth
and
flatten
all
thy
soaring
thoughts
with
their
dull
commonplaces
thrift
honesty
is
the
best
policy
time
is
money
knowledge
is
wealth
and
all
the

of

philosophy
poor

who
wouldst
look
out
into
the

as
great

and
behold
in

its

effulgence
of

golden
flood

all
speak
of
some
diviner

how
they

soul
full
of
high
dreams
and
noble
purposes
with
their
cold
teaching
that
man
lives
on

alone
put
money
in
thy

when
thou

look
back
with
awe

reverence
to
the
sacred
ages
past
to
the
heroes
sages
saints
of
the
olden
times
they
come
with
their
gabble
and
tell
thee
there
were
no
railroads
and
common
schools
in
those
days
is
it
strange
that
this
education
should
hurt
the
highest
interests
by
driving
in
crowds
like
cattle
to
the
shambles
our
youths
from
god
and
nature
and
tilling
of
the
soil
to
town
and
city
or
worse
into
professions
to
which
only
their
conceit
or
distaste
for
hard
labor
calls
them
what
place
for
morality
is
there
in
this
poor
catechism
education
of
thrift
and
best
policy
we
grow
in
likeness
to
what
we
love
not
to
what
we
know
with
low
aims
and
selfish
loves
only
narrow
and
imperfect
characters
are
compatible
science
when
cherished
for
itself
which
it
seldom
is
and
in
very
exceptional
cases
refines
and
purifies
its
lovers
and
chastens
the
force
of
passion
though
even
here
we
must
admit
that
the
wisest
of
mankind
may
be
the
meanest
morally
the
most
unworthy
but
for
the
great
mass
of
men
even
of
those
who
are
called
educated
the
possession
of
such
knowledge
as
they
have
or
can
have
has
no
necessary
relation
with
higher
moral
life
their
learning
may
refine
smooth
over
or
conceal
their
sin
it
will
not
destroy
it
the
furred
gown
and
intertissued
robe
hide
the
faults
that
peep
through
rags
but
they
are
there
all
the
same
there
may
be
a
substitution
of
pride
for
sensuality
or
a
skilful
blending
or
alternation
of
the
finer
with
the
coarser
vice
may
lose
its
grossness
but
not
its
evil
and
herein
we
detect
the
wretched
sophistry
of
criminal
statistics
which
deal
imperfectly
and
roughly
enough
with
what
is
open
shocking
and
repulsive
the
hidden
sins
that
pitted
speck
in
garnered
fruit
slowly
eating
to
the
core
of
a
life
moulder
all
the
sapping
of
faith
the
weakening
of
character
the
disbelief
in
goodness
the
luxury
the
indulgence
the
heartlessness
and
narrowness
of
the
rich
the
cunning
devices
through
which
spirit
of
works
in
the
very
means
of
life
rank
corruption
mining
all
within
infects
can
not
be
appreciated
by
the
gross
tests
of
numbers
and
averages
the
poor
by
statistics
as
by
the
world
are
handled
without
gloves
in
the
large
cities
of
civilized
countries
both
in
ancient
and
in
modern
times
we
have
unmistakable
proof
of
what
knowledge
can
do
to
form
character
and
produce
even
the
social
virtues
these
populations
have
had
the
advantage
of
the
best
schools
in
the
most
favorable
circumstances
and
yet
in
character
and
morality
they
are
far
beneath
the
less
educated
peasantry
sensual
indulgence
contempt
of
authority
hatred
and
jealousy
of
those
above
them
make
these
the
dangerous
classes
eager
for
socialistic
reforms
radical
upheavals
of
the
whole
existing
order
and
were
it
not
for
the
more
religious
tillers
of
the
soil
chaos
and
misrule
would
already
prevail
in
greece
and
rome
it
was
in
the
cities
that
civilization
first
perished
as
it
was
there
it
began
began
with
men
who
had
great
faith
and
strong
character
but
little
knowledge
perished
among
men
who
were
learned
and
refined
but
who
in
indulgence
and
debauch
had
lost
all
strength
and
honesty
of
purpose
in
the
last
report
of
the
commissioner
of
education
some
interesting
facts
bearing
on
the
relation
of
ignorance
to
crime
are
taken
from
the
annual
report
of
the
inspector
of
the
state
penitentiary
for
the
eastern
district
of
pennsylvania
is
doubted
if
in
any
state
or
indeed
in
any
country
says
the
commissioner
volumes
containing
the
annual
statistical
tables
relating
to
the
populations
of
a
penal
institution
covering
nearly
half
a
century
can
on
examination
be
regarded
as
more
the
number
of
prisoners
received
into
the
institution
from
to
was
of
whom
per
cent
were
illiterate
per
cent
were
able
to
read
and
per
or
more
than
knew
how
to
read
and
write
from
to
prisoners
were
received
into
the
penitentiary
and
of
these
per
cent
were
illiterate
per
cent
could
read
and
about
per
cent
could
read
and
write
of
the
convicts
who
were
in
the
penitentiary
during
the
year
per
or
of
the
whole
number

attended
the
public
schools
of
the
state
per

had
gone
to
private
institutions
and
per
or
had
never
gone
to
school
but
as
we
have
said
statistics
deal
with
crime
and
chiefly
with
the
more
open
and
discoverable
sort
not
with
morality
whereas
nations
are
destroyed
not
so
much
by
crime
as
by
immorality
the
thief
is
caught
and
sent
to
the
penitentiary
but
the
trader
who
adulterates
or
gives
short
measure
the
banker
who
puts
forth
a
false
or
exaggerated
statement
the
merchant
who
fails
with
full

not
the

nor
the
size
of
cities
nor
the
crops
no
but
the
kind
of
man
the
country
turns
the
yankee
is
smarter
than
the
puritan
is
he
as
true
a
man
is
the
inventor
of
a
or
a
patent
bedstead
as
worthy
as
he
who
believes
in
god
and
in
liberty
against
the
whole

with
all
his
heart
and
soul
even
though
the

be
hard
and
the

narrow
what
compensation
is
there
in
all
our
philanthropies
transcendentalisms
sentimentalities
patent
remedies
for
social
evils
for
the
loss
of
the
strong
convictions
reverent
belief
and
simple
dignity
of
character
that
made
our
fathers
men
do
we
believe
in
the
goodness
and
honesty
of
men
as
they
did
or
is
it
possible
that
we
should
what
can
come
of
beliefs
in
oversouls
whims
tendencies
abstractions
developments
if
we
were
shadows
in
a
this
might
do
look
at
a
famous
trial
where
the
very
aroma
and
fine
essence
of
our
civilization
was
gathered
what
bright
minds
keen
intellects
poetry
eloquence
romance
the
culture
the
knowledge
the
scientific
theories
of
the
age
all
are
there
and
yet
when
the
veil
is
lifted
we
simply
turn
away
heart
sick
and
nauseated
not
a
hundred
statistical
prison
reports
would
reveal
the
festering
corruption
and
deep
depravity
the
coarse
vulgarity
and
utter
heartlessness
that
is
there
whatever
the
truth
may
be
if
in
such
surroundings
it
can
be
found
at
all
in
of
a
we
find
a
most
striking
example
of
almost
incredible
corruption
united
with
great
intellectual
culture
this
way
he
says
must
account
for
the
singular
fact
that
the
only
positively
immoral
religious
sect
of
the
present
times
in
the
christian
world
arose
and
has
spread
itself
in
the
most
educated
part
of
the
most
educated
country
in
europe
in
and
about
königsberg
the
capital
of
the
province
of
old
prussia
the
muckers
are
a
sect
who
combine
lewdness
with
religion
the
conventicles
of
this
sect
are
frequented
by
men
and
women
in
a
state
of
nudity
and
to
excite
the
animal
passion
but
to
restrain
its
indulgence
is
said
to
constitute
their
religious
exercise
many
of
the
highest
nobility
of
the
province
and
two
of
the
established
clergy
of
the
city
besides
citizens
artificers
and
ladies
old
and
young
belong
to
this
sect
and
two
young
ladies
are
stated
to
have
died
from
the
consequences
of
excessive
libidinous
excitement
it
is
no
secret
association
of
profligacy
shunning
the
light
it
is
a
sect
according
to
the
declarations
of
von
tippelskirch
and
of
several
persons
of
consideration
in
königsberg
who
had
been
followers
of
it
themselves
existing
very
extensively
under
the
leadership
of
the
established
ministers
of
the
gospel
ebel
and
diestel
of
a
count
von
kaniz
of
a
lady
von
s
and
of
other
noble
the
system
and
theory
of
this
dreadful
combination
of
vice
with
religion
are
of
course
very
properly
the
sect
itself
appears
by
account
of
it
to
have
been
so
generally
diffused
that
he
says
can
not
be
believed
that
the
public
functionaries
were
in
ignorance
of
its
existence
but
they
were
afraid
to
do
their
duty
from
the
influence
of
the
many
principal
people
who
were
involved
in
but
we
are
not
the
advocates
of
ignorance
we
will
praise
with
any
man
the
true
worth
and
inestimable
value
of
education
even
mere
mental
training
is
to
our
thinking
of
rare
price
water
is
good
but
without
bread
it
will
not
sustain
life
wine
warms
and
gladdens
the
heart
of
man
but
if
used
without
care
it
maddens
and
drives
to
destruction
we
are
crying
out
against
the
folly
of
the
age
which
would
make
the
its
church
education
its
sacrament
and
culture
its
religion
it
is
the
road
to
ruin
culture
is
for
the
few
and
what
a
trumpery
patchwork
of
frippery
and
finery
and
paste
diamonds
it
must
ever
remain
for
the
most
of
these
for
the
millions
it
means
the
pagan
debauch
the
bacchanal
orgy
and
mere
animalism
characters
wrote
goethe
who
was
pagan
of
the
pagans
and
we
can
truly
respect
have
become
rarer
we
can
sincerely
esteem
only
that
which
is
not
i
must
confess
to
have
found
through
my
whole
life
unselfish
characters
of
the
kind
of
which
i
speak
only
there
where
i
found
a
religious
life
a
creed
which
had
an
unchangeable
basis
resting
upon
itself
not
dependent
upon
the
time
its
spirit
or
its
this
foundation
of
a
positive
religious
faith
is
as
indispensable
to
national
as
to
individual
character
and
without
it
the
diffusion
of
enlightenment
can
not
create
a
great
or
lasting
civilization
religion
ought
to
constitute
the
very
essence
of
all
primary
education
it
alone
can
touch
the
heart
raise
the
mind
and
evoke
from
their
brutish
apathy
the
elements
of
humanity
especially
the
reason
and
it
is
therefore
the
one
indispensable
element
in
any
right
system
of
national
education
a
population
unable
to
read
or
write
but
with
a
religious
faith
and
discipline
has
before
now
constituted
and
may
again
constitute
a
great
nation
but
a
people
without
religious
earnestness
has
no
solid
political
character
religion
is
the
widest
and
deepest
of
all
the
elements
of
civilization
it
reaches
those
whom
nothing
else
can
touch
but
for
the
masses
of
men
there
can
be
no
religion
without
the
authoritative
teaching
of
a
church
and
now
let
us
return
to
de
laveleye
general
spread
of
education
he
says
indispensable
to
the
exercise
of
constitutional
education
is
the
basis
of
national
liberty
and
in
view
of
the
facts
that
constitutional
liberty
has
existed
and
for
centuries
in
states
in
which
there
was
no
spread
of
education
and
that
diffusion
of
is
found
in
our
own
day
to
with
the
most
hateful
despotisms
we
might
pass
on
without
stopping
to
examine
more
closely
these
loose
and
popular
phrases
but
since
the
fallacies
which
they
contain
form
a
part
of
the
of
modern
paganism
and
are
accepted
as
indisputable
truths
by
the
multitude
they
have
a
claim
upon
our
attention
which
their
assertion
by
friend
could
not
give
them
there
is
no
necessary
connection
between
popular
education
and
civil
liberty
as
there
is
none
between
the
enlightenment
and
the
morality
of
a
people
this
is
a
subject
full
of
import
one
which
in
this
age
and
country
ought
to
be
discussed
with
perfect
freedom
and
courage
courage
indeed
is
needed
precisely
here
for
to
deny
that
there
is
a
god
to
treat
christ
as
a
myth
or
a
common
man
to
declaim
against
religion
as
superstition
to
make
the
bible
a
butt
for
witticisms
and
fine
points
to
deny
future
life
and
the
immortality
to
denounce
marriage
to
preach
communism
and
to
ridicule
whatever
things
mankind
have
hitherto
held
sacred
this
is
not
only
tolerable
it
is
praiseworthy
and
runs
with
the
free
thought
of
an
enlightened
and
inquiring
age
but
to
raise
a
doubt
as
to
the
supreme
and
paramount
value
of
intellectual
training
of
its
sovereign
efficacy
in
the
cure
of
human
ills
of
its
inseparable
alliance
with
freedom
with
progress
with
best
interests
is
pernicious
heresy
and
ought
not
to
be
borne
with
patiently
in
our
civilization
through
the
action
of
majorities
there
is
special
difficulty
in
such
discussions
since
with
us
nothing
is
true
except
what
is
popular
majorities
rule
and
are
therefore
right
with
rare
eloquence
we
denounce
tyrant
kings
and
turn
to
lick
the
hands
of
the
tyrant
people
whoever
questions
the
wisdom
of
the
american
people
is
not
to
be
argued
with
he
is
to
be
pitied
and
therefore
both
press
and
pulpit
though
they
flaunt
the
banner
of
freedom
are
the
servants
of
the
tyrant
to
have
no
principles
but
to
write
and
speak
what
will
please
the
most
and
offend
the
fewest
this
is
the
philosophy
of
free
speech
we
therefore
have
no
independent
and
consequently
no
great
thinkers
it
is
dangerous
not
to
think
with
majorities
and
parties
for
those
who
attempt
to
break
their
bonds
generally
succeed
like
emerson
only
in
becoming
whimsical
weak
and
inconclusive
it
is
not
surprising
then
that
the
catholics
because
they
do
not
accept
as
true
or
ultimate
what
is
supposed
to
be
the
final
thought
and
definite
will
of
american
majorities
on
the
subject
of
education
should
be
denounced
threatened
and
made
a
trojan
horse
of
to
carry
political
adventurers
into
the
white
house
nevertheless
the
observant
are
losing
confidence
in
the
theory
so
full
of
inspiration
to
demagogues
and
declaimers
that
superstition
and
despotism
must
be
founded
on
ignorance
in
prussia
at
this
moment
universal
education
with
despotism
where
tyrannical
governments
take
control
of
education
they
easily
make
it
their
ally
let
us
hear
what
laing
says
of
the
practical
results
of
the
prussian
system
of
education
which
it
is
so
much
the
fashion
to
praise
the
ultimate
object
he
says
all
education
and
knowledge
be
to
raise
man
to
the
feeling
of
his
own
moral
worth
to
a
sense
of
his
responsibility
to
his
creator
and
to
his
conscience
for
every
act
to
the
dignity
of
a
reflecting
virtuous
religious
member
of
society
then
the
prussian
educational
system
is
a
failure
it
is
only
a
training
from
childhood
in
the
conventional
discipline
and
submission
of
mind
which
the
state
exacts
from
its
subjects
it
is
not
a
training
or
education
which
has
raised
but
which
has
lowered
the
human
the
social
value
or
importance
of
the
prussian
arrangements
for
diffusing
national
scholastic
education
has
been
evidently
overrated
for
now
that
the
whole
system
has
been
in
the
fullest
operation
in
society
upon
a
whole
generation
we
see
morals
and
religion
in
a
more
unsatisfactory
state
in
this
very
country
than
in
almost
any
other
in
the
north
of
europe
we
see
nowhere
a
people
in
a
more
abject
political
and
civil
condition
or
with
less
free
agency
in
their
social
economy
a
national
education
which
gives
a
nation
neither
religion
nor
morality
nor
civil
liberty
nor
political
liberty
is
an
education
not
worth
if
to
read
write
cipher
and
sing
be
education
the
prussian
subject
is
an
educated
man
if
to
reason
judge
and
act
as
an
independent
free
agent
in
the
religious
moral
and
social
relations
of
man
to
his
creator
and
to
his
be
the
exercise
of
the
mental
powers
which
alone
deserves
the
name
of
education
then
is
the
prussian
subject
a
mere
drum
boy
in
education
in
the
cultivation
and
use
of
all
that
regards
the
moral
and
intellectual
endowments
of
man
compared
to
one
of
the
unlettered
population
of
a
free
country
the
dormant
state
of
the
public
mind
on
all
affairs
of
public
interest
the
acquiescence
in
a
total
want
of
political
influence
or
existence
the
intellectual
dependence
upon
the
government
or
its
functionary
in
all
the
affairs
of
the
community
the
abject
submission
to
the
want
of
freedom
or
free
agency
in
thoughts
words
or
acts
the
religious
thraldom
of
the
people
to
forms
which
they
despise
the
want
of
influence
of
religious
and
social
principle
in
society
justify
the
conclusion
that
the
moral
religious
and
social
condition
of
the
people
was
never
looked
at
or
estimated
by
those
writers
who
were
so
enthusiastic
in
their
praises
of
the
national
education
of
in
spite
of
the
continued
progress
of
education
there
is
even
less
liberty
religious
civil
and
political
in
prussia
than
when
these
words
were
written
thirty
years
ago
nothing
more
dazzles
the
eyes
of
men
than
great
military
success
and
this
together
with
the
habit
which
belongs
to
our
race
of
applauding
whoever
wins
has
produced
especially
in
england
and
the
united
states
where
bismarck
is
looked
upon
ignorantly
enough
as
the
champion
of
protestantism
a
kind
of
blind
admiration
and
awe
for
whatever
is
prussian
prussia
boasts
de
laveleye
defeated
two
empires
each
containing
twice
her
own
population
the
one
in
seven
weeks
the
other
in
seven
and
in
the
new
edition
of
we
are
informed
that
these
victories
are
attributed
to
the
superior
education
of
her
people
as
well
might
the
tyranny
of
the
government
and
the
notorious
unchastity
and
dishonesty
of
the
prussians
be
ascribed
to
their
superior
education
not
to
the
general
intelligence
of
the
people
but
to
the
fact
that
the
whole
country
has
been
turned
into
a
military
camp
and
that
to
the
one
purpose
of
war
all
interests
have
been
made
subservient
must
we
seek
for
an
explanation
of
the
victories
of
sadowa
and
sedan
who
would
pretend
that
the
spartans
were
in
war
superior
to
the
athenians
because
they
had
a
more
perfect
system
of
education
and
were
more
intelligent
or
had
a
truer
religion
or
who
would
think
of
accounting
in
this
way
for
the
marvellous
exploits
of
attila
with
his
huns
of
zingis
khan
with
his
moguls
of
tamerlane
with
his
tartars
of
mahmood
and
with
their
turkish
hordes
in
fact
it
may
be
said
speaking
largely
and
in
general
that
the
history
of
war
is
that
of
the
triumph
of
strong
and
ignorant
races
over
those
which
have
become
cultivated
refined
and
corrupt
the
romans
learned
from
their
conquered
slaves
letters
and
the
vices
of
a
more
polished
paganism
barbarism
is
ever
impending
over
the
civilized
world
the
wild
and
rugged
north
is
ever
rushing
down
upon
the
soft
and
cultured
south
the
scythian
upon
the
mede
the
persian
and
the
egyptian
the
macedonian
upon
greece
and
then
upon

the

upon

in
turn
falling

like
black
clouds
of

the
russian

over

educated
europe
look
at
italy
during
the
middle
ages
the
focus
of
learning
and
the
arts
for
all
christendom
and
yet
an
easy
prey
for
every
barbarous
adventurer
and
in
england
the
briton
yields
to
the
saxon
who
in
turn
falls
before
the
norman
it
would
be
truer
to
say
that
prussia
owes
her
military
successes
to
the
ignorance
of
her
people
though
they
nearly
all
can
read
and
write
had
she
had
to
deal
with
intelligent
enlightened
and
thinking
populations
she
could
not
have
made
the
country
a
camp
of
soldiers
the
prussian
policy
of
and
has
been
carried
out
in
defiance
of
the
wishes
of
the
people
as
expressed
through
their
representatives
who
were
snubbed
and
scolded
and
sent
back
home
as
though
they
were
a
pack
of
schoolboys
yet
the
people
looked
on
in
stolid
indifference
and
allowed
the
tax
to
be
levied
after
they
had
refused
to
grant
it
we
will
now
follow
de
laveleye
a
step
farther
regard
to
elementary
instruction
he
says
protestant
states
are
incomparably
more
advanced
than
the
catholic
england
alone
is
no
more
than
on
a
level
with
the
latter
probably
because
the
anglican
church
of
all
the
reformed
forms
of
worship
has
most
in
common
with
the
church
of
if
any
one
has
good
reason
to
praise
education
and
above
all
the
education
of
the
people
certainly
we
catholics
have
the
catholic
church
created
the
people
she
first
preached
the
divine
doctrine
of
the
brotherhood
and
equality
of
all
men
before
god
which
has
wrought
and
must
continue
to
work
upon
society
until
all
men
shall
be
recognized
as
equals
by
the
law
she
drew
around
woman
her
magic
circle
from
the
slave
struck
his
fetters
and
bade
him
be
a
man
lifted
to
her
bosom
the
child
baptized
all
humanity
into
the
inviolable
sacredness
of
divinity
she
appealed
and
still
appeals
from
the
tyranny
of
brute
force
and
success
in
the
name
of
the
eternal
liberties
of
the
soul
to
god
her
martyrs
were
and
are
the
martyrs
of
liberty
and
if
she
were
not
all
men
would
accept
accomplished
facts
and
bow
before
whatever
succeeds
the
barbarians
who
have
developed
into
the
civilized
peoples
of
europe
despised
learning
as
they
contemned
labor
war
was
their
business
the
knight
signed

on
says
newman
speaking
of
the
mediæval
universities
new
state
of
things
intellectual
and
social
came
in
the
church
was
girt
with
temporal
power
the
preachers
of
dominic
were
in
the
ascendant
now
at
length
we
may
ask
with
curious
interest
did
the
church
alter
her
ancient
rule
of
action
and
proscribe
intellectual
activity
just
the
contrary
this
is
the
very
age
of
universities
it
is
the
classical
period
of
the
schoolmen
it
is
the
splendid
and
palmary
instance
of
the
wise
policy
and
large
liberality
of
the
church
as
regards
philosophical
inquiry
if
there
ever
was
a
time
when
the
intellect
went
wild
and
had
a
licentious
revel
it
was
at
the
date
i
speak
of
when
was
there
ever
a
more
curious
more
meddling
bolder
keener
more
penetrating
more
rationalistic
exercise
of
the
reason
than
at
that
time
what
class
of
questions
did
that
subtle
metaphysical
spirit
not
scrutinize
what
premise
was
allowed
without
examination
what
principle
was
not
traced
to
its
first
origin
and
exhibited
in
its
most
naked
shape
well
i
repeat
here
was
something
which
came
somewhat
nearer
to
theology
than
physical
research
comes
aristotle
was
a
somewhat
more
serious
foe
then
beyond
all
mistake
than
bacon
has
been
since
did
the
church
take
a
high
hand
with
philosophy
then
no
not
though
that
philosophy
was
metaphysical
it
was
a
time
when
she
had
temporal
power
and
could
have
exterminated
the
spirit
of
inquiry
with
fire
and
sword
but
she
determined
to
put
it
down
by
she
said
can
play
at
that
and
my
argument
is
the
she
sent
her
controversialists
into
the
philosophical
arena
it
was
the
dominican
and
franciscan
doctors
the
greatest
of
them
being
thomas
who
in
those
mediæval
universities
fought
the
battle
of
revelation
with
the
weapons
of
to
find
fault
with
the
church
because
popular
education
in
the
middle
ages
was
not
organized
and
general
as
it
has
since
become
would
be
as
wise
as
to
pick
a
quarrel
with
the
ancient
greeks
for
not
having
railroads
or
with
the
romans
because
they
had
no
steamships
reading
and
writing
were
not
taught
then
universally
as
they
are
now
because
it
was
physically
and
morally
impossible
that
they
should
have
been
without
steam
and
the
systems
would
not
now
be
practicable
nor
would
the
want
of
them
be
felt
we
have
great
reason
to
be
thankful
that
the
art
of
printing
was
invented
and
america
discovered
before
luther
burned
the
bull
else
we
should
be
continually
bothered
with
refuting
the
historians
who
would
have
infallibly
traced
both
these
events
to
the
wittenberg
conflagration
all
europe
was
still
catholic
when
gunpowder
drove
old
father
pestle
through
the
ceiling
when
gutenberg
made
his
when
columbus
landed
in
the
new
world
and
these
are
the
forces
which
have
battered
down
the
castles
of
feudalism
have
brought
knowledge
within
the
reach
of
all
and
some
measure
of
redress
to
the
masses
of
the
old
world
by
affording
them
the
possibility
and
opportunity
of
liberty
in
the
new
these
forces
would
have
wrought
to
even
better
purpose
had
protestantism
not
broken
the
continuity
and
homogeneity
of
christian
civilization
the
turk
would
not
rest
like
a
blight
from
heaven
upon
the
fairest
lands
of
europe
and
asia
nor
the
darkness
of
heathenism
upon
india
and
china
had
the
civilized
nations
remained
of
one
faith
and
thus
though
our
own
train
might
have
rushed
less
rapidly
down
the
ringing
grooves
of
change
the
whole
human
race
would
have
advanced
to
a
level
which
there
now
seems
but
little
reason
to
hope
it
will
ever
reach
but
to
come
more
nearly
to
de
assertion
that
the
protestant
states
are
incomparably
more
advanced
than
the
catholic
with
the
exception
of
england
which
in
this
matter
is
at
least
up
to
the
standard
of
catholic
countries
in
the
report
of
the
commissioner
of
education
for
there
is
a
statistical
account
of
the
state
of
education
in
foreign
countries
which
throws
some
light
upon
this
subject
the
school
attendance
compared
with
the
population
is
in
austria
as
to
in
belgium
as
to
in
ireland
as
to
in
catholic
switzerland
as
to
in
england
as
to
in
bavaria
it
is
as
to
upon
the
authority
of
kay
in
his
condition
of
the
people
in
england
and
catholic
austria
bavaria
belgium
and
ireland
have
proportionately
a
larger
school
attendance
than
protestant
england
england
and
wales
report
of
with
a
population
of
had
a
school
population
of
of
whom
only
about
half
were
registered
and
not
half
of
these
attended
with
sufficient
regularity
to
bring
grants
to
their
schools
ireland
with
a
population
of
had
on
register
or
nearly
half
as
many
as
england
and
wales
though
her
population
is
not
a
fourth
of
that
of
these
two
countries
statistical
fact
says
laing
speaking
of
rome
as
it
was
under
the
popes
rome
has
above
a
hundred
schools
more
than
berlin
for
a
population
little
more
than
half
that
of
berlin
puts
to
flight
a
world
of
humbug
about
systems
of
national
education
carried
on
by
governments
and
their
moral
effects
on
in
catholic
germany
in
france
italy
and
even
spain
the
education
of
the
common
people
in
reading
writing
arithmetic
music
manners
and
morals
is
at
least
as
generally
diffused
and
as
faithfully
promoted
by
the
clerical
body
as
in
scotland
it
is
by
their
own
advance
and
not
by
keeping
back
the
advance
of
the
people
that
the
popish
priesthood
of
the
present
day
seek
to
keep
ahead
of
the
intellectual
progress
of
the
community
in
catholic
lands
and
they
might
perhaps
retort
on
our
presbyterian
clergy
and
ask
if
they
too
are
in
their
countries
at
the
head
of
the
intellectual
movement
of
the
age
education
is
in
reality
not
only
not
repressed
but
is
encouraged
by
the
popish
church
and
is
a
mighty
instrument
in
its
hands
and
ably
professor
testimony
is
confirmatory
of
this
admission
of
laing
was
my
fortune
he
says
time
ago
to
pay
a
visit
to
one
of
the
most
important
of
the
institutions
in
which
the
clergy
of
the
roman
catholic
church
in
these
islands
are
trained
and
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
difference
between
these
men
and
the
comfortable
champions
of
anglicanism
and
dissent
was
comparable
to
the
difference
between
our
gallant
volunteers
and
the
trained
veterans
of
old
guard
the
catholic
priest
is
trained
to
know
his
business
and
do
it
effectually
the
professors
of
the
college
in
question
learned
zealous
and
determined
men
permitted
me
to
speak
frankly
with
them
we
talked
like
outposts
of
opposed
armies
during
a
truce
as
friendly
enemies
and
when
i
ventured
to
point
out
the
difficulties
their
students
would
have
to
encounter
from
scientific
thought
they
replied
church
has
lasted
many
ages
and
has
passed
safely
through
many
storms
the
present
is
but
a
new
gust
of
the
old
tempest
and
we
do
not
turn
out
our
young
men
less
fitted
to
weather
it
than
they
have
been
in
former
times
to
cope
with
the
difficulties
of
those
is
a
common
remark
says
kay
the
operatives
of
lancashire
and
one
which
is
only
too
true
church
is
a
church
for
the
rich
but
not
for
the
poor
it
was
not
intended
for
such
people
as
we
the
roman
church
is
much
wiser
than
the
english
in
this
it
is
singular
to
observe
how
the
priests
of
romanist
countries
abroad
associate
with
the
poor
i
have
often
seen
them
riding
with
the
peasants
in
their
carts
along
the
roads
eating
with
them
in
their
houses
sitting
with
them
in
the
village
inns
mingling
with
them
in
their
village
festivals
and
yet
always
preserving
their
with
us
too
the
masses
of
the
people
are
fast
abandoning
protestantism
there
is
no
catholic
country
in
europe
in
which
the
social
condition
of
the
masses
is
so
wretched
as
in
england
the
representative
protestant
country
for
three
hundred
years
it
may
be
said
the
catholic
church
had
no
existence
there
the
nation
was
exclusively
under
protestant
influence
and
yet
the
lower
classes
were
suffered
to
remain
in
stolid
ignorance
until
they
became
the
most
degraded
population
in
christendom
has
been
calculated
says
kay
writing
in
there
are
at
the
present
day
in
england
and
wales
nearly
persons
who
can
not
read
and
that
was
more
than
half
of
the
whole
population
at
that
time
but
this
is
not
the
worst
a
population
ignorant
of
reading
and
writing
may
nevertheless
to
a
certain
extent
be
educated
through
religious
teaching
and
influence
but
these
unhappy
creatures
were
left
helpless
and
hopeless
to
sink
deeper
and
deeper
beneath
the
weight
of
their
degradation
without
being
brought
into
contact
with
any
power
that
could
refine
or
elevate
them
and
if
their
condition
has
somewhat
improved
in
the
last
quarter
of
a
century
this
is
no
more
to
be
attributed
to
protestantism

the
catholic
emancipation

the
search
nearly
over
it
was
one
of
those
exquisitely
lovely
mornings
that
we
sometimes
see
in
early
spring
the
night
had
been
frosty
and
had
hurried
to
meet
the
dawn
leaving
her
moonlight
mantle
behind
her
frozen
to
silver
on
every
field
or
the
sky
was
of
a
heavenly
blue
liquid
turquoise
swept
with
feathery
dashes
of
pink
that
set
off
the
glistening
landscape
like
a
velvet
curtain
spread
for
the
purpose
the
sun
was
shining
through
a
pearly
mist
that
hung
a
silver
gauze
veil
in
the
air
and
made
everything
look
dreamy
and
the
meadows
were
silvered
with
frost
so
were
the
hedges
every
twig
and
thorn
finished
like
a
jewel
the
trees
stood
up
like
immense
bouquets
of
filigree
against
the
pink
and
blue
curtain
no
wonder
franceline
who
had
been
awake
and
watching
the
sunrise
from
her
window
stole
a
march
on
angélique
and
hastened
out
to
enjoy
the
beauty
of
the
morning
it
was
impossible
it
could
hurt
her
it
was
too
lovely
to
be
unkind
but
besides
this
outward
incentive
there
was
another
one
that
impelled
her
to
the
daring
escapade
she
felt
an
irresistible
longing
to
go
to
church
this
morning
one
of
those
longings
that
she
called
presentiments
and
seldom
rejected
without
having
reason
to
regret
it
it
was
not
that
she
was
uneasy
or
alarmed
or
unhappy
about
anything
nothing
had
occurred
to
awake
the
dormant
fires
that
were
still
smouldering
though
she
thought
them
dead
and
impel
her
to
seek
for
strength
in
a
threatened
renewal
of
the
combat
sir
disappearance
the
morning
after
the
some
few
days
ago
had
not
surprised
her
that
was
his
way
and
this
time
she
had
been
prepared
for
it
it
was
true
that
ever
since
then
her
father
had
been
more
preoccupied
more
inseparable
from
his
work
it
was
a
perfect
mania
with
him
for
the
last
three
or
four
days
he
scarcely
let
the
pen
out
of
his
hand
from
morning
till
night
he
seemed
moreover
to
have
got
to
a
point
where
he
could
no
longer
use
her
as
an
amanuensis
but
must
write
himself
franceline
was
distressed
at
the
change
it
deprived
her
of
the
pleasure
of
helping
him
and
of
their
daily
walk
together
which
had
of
late
become
the
principal
enjoyment
of
her
life
but
he
could
not
be
persuaded
to
go
beyond
the
garden
gate
and
then
only
for
ten
minutes
to
take
a
breath
of
air
he
was
in
a
hurry
to
get
back
to
his
study
as
if
the
minutes
were
so
much
gold
wasted
franceline
was
obliged
to
accept
this
sudden
alteration
in
his
habits
with
the
assurance
that
it
would
not
be
for
long
that
the
great
work
was
drawing
to
a
close
and
that
when
it
was
finished
he
would
be
free
to
walk
with
her
as
much
as
she
liked
and
in
more
beautiful
places
than
dullerton
this
last
she
did
not
believe
no
place
could
ever
be
so
beautiful
as
this
familiar
one
because
none
would
ever
be
hallowed
by
the
same
sweet
early
memories
or
sanctified
by
the
same
sufferings
and
regrets
there
was
a
spirit
brooding
over
these
quiet
sylvan
slopes
that
could
never
dwell
for
her
elsewhere
she
looked
around
her
at
the
leafless
woods
that
lay
white
and
silent
in
the
near
distance
and
at
the
river
winding
slowly
towards
them
like
an
azure
arm
encircling
the
silver
fields
and
she
sighed
at
the
thought
of
ever
leaving
them
the
sigh
escaped
from
her
lips
in
a
little
column
of
sapphire
smoke
for
the
air
was
as
clear
as
crystal
but
it
was
cold
too
and
the
bell
was
already
ringing
so
she
drew
her
shawl
closer
and
hurried
on
what
was
that
fly
doing
before
the
presbytery
door
who
could
have
business
with
father
henwick
at
such
an
unearthly
hour
as
seven
when
people
live
in
a
small
place
where
life
is
a
routine
as
well
known
as
their
own
to
everybody
else
the
smallest
trifle
out
of
the
usual
way
is
magnified
into
an
event
franceline
was
not
very
curious
by
nature
she
passed
the
mysterious
fly
with
a
momentary
glance
of
interest
and
then
dismissed
it
from
her
thoughts
the
little
church
was
never
full
on
its
congregation
being
mostly
of
the
class
who
can
only
afford
the
luxury
of
going
to
church
on
sundays
a
few
kindly
glances
greeted
her
as
she
walked
up
to
her
place
near
the
sanctuary
since
her
health
had
become
delicate
it
was
a
rare
occurrence
to
see
her
there
during
the
week
so
her
presence
was
looked
on
as
of
good
omen
she
answered
the
welcoming
eyes
with
a
sweet
grateful
smile
and
then
knelt
down
and
soon
forgot
them
we
talk
of
magnetic
atmospheres
where
instinct
warns
us
of
a
presence
without
any
indication
from
our
senses
i
know
whether
franceline
believed
in
such
influences
but
her
attitude
of
rapt
devotion
as
she
knelt
before
the
altar
seemingly
unconscious
of
anything
earthly
near
her
her
soul
drawn
upwards
through
her
eyes
and
fixed
on
the
unseen
did
not
suggest
that
there
was
any
human
presence
within
reach
which
had
power
to
move
her
when
father
henwick
had
left
the
altar
she
rose
and
went
to
the
sacristy
door
to
ask
if
she
could
see
him
she
wanted
to
speak
to
him
about
a
poor
woman
in
the
village
it
was
not
the
clerk
but
father
henwick
himself
who
came
to
answer
her
message
he
did
not
welcome
his
young
penitent
in
his
usual
gracious
affectionate
manner
but
asked
sharply
gave
her
leave
to
be
out
at
that
hour
morning
was
so
sunny
i
thought
it
would
do
me
no
harm
to
come
replied
the
culprit
with
a
sudden
sense
of
having
done
something
very
wicked
had
no
business
to
think
about
it
at
all
you
should
not
have
come
without
your
permission
go
home
as
fast
as
you
franceline
was
turning
away
when
he
called
her
back
this
way
you
can
go
out
through
the
then
he
added
in
a
mollified
tone
foolish
child
i
hope
you
are
warmly
clad
keep
your
chest
well
covered
and
hold
your
muff
up
to
your
mouth
be
off
now
as
quick
as
you
can
and
let
me
have
no
more
of
these
tricks
he
shook
hands
with
her
and
opening
the
sacristy
door
that
led
into
the
presbytery
hurried
her
away
franceline
was
too
much
discomfited
by
the
abrupt
dismissal
to
conjecture
why
she
was
hustled
out
through
the
house
instead
of
being
allowed
to
go
back
through
the
church
the
natural
way
and
quite
as
short
she
could
not
understand
why
father
henwick
should
have
shown
such
annoyance
and
surprise
at
the
sight
of
her
this
was
not
the
first
time
she
had
played
the
trick
on
them
at
home
of
coming
out
to
church
on
a
sunny
morning
and
it
had
never
done
her
any
harm
she
was
turning
the
riddle
in
her
mind
as
she
passed
through
the
little
into
the
entry
when
she
saw
the
front
door
standing
wide
open
and
a
gentleman
outside
speaking
to
the
the
moment
he
perceived
franceline
he
raised
his
hat
and
remained
uncovered
while
he
spoke
mademoiselle
how
is
de
la
bourbonais
you
my
father
is
quite
she
and
clide
looked
at
each
other
as
they
exchanged
this
commonplace
greeting
but
they
did
not
shake
hands
neither
could
probably
have
explained
what
the
feeling
was
that
held
them
back
franceline
went
on
her
way
and
clide
de
winton
entered
the
presbytery
each
bearing
away
the
sound
of
the
voice
and
the
sweetness
of
that
rapid
glance
with
a
terrible
sense
of
joy
heart
beat
high
within
her
as
she
walked
on
what
right
had
it
to
do
so
how
dared
it
poor
fluttering
heart
no
bitter
upbraidings
of
indignant
conscience
no
taunts
of
womanly
pride
could
make
it
stop
the
more
she
tried
to
silence
it
the
louder
it
cried
she
was
close
by
the
lilies
and
it
was
crying
out
and
throbbing
wildly
still
she
could
not
go
in
and
face
her
father
in
this
state
she
must
gain
a
few
minutes
to
collect
and
calm
herself
the
grew
in
great
profusion
on
a
bank
in
the
park
at
the
back
of
the
cottage
raymond
was
fond
of
wild
flowers
she
would
go
and
gather
him
some
this
would
account
for
her
delay
she
laid
her
muff
on
the
grass
it
was
wet
with
the
melting
in
the
sun
but
franceline
did
not
see
this
she
stooped
down
and
began
to
pluck
the
it
was
a
congenial
task
in
her
present
frame
of
mind
had
always
been
favorites
with
her
in
her
childish
days
of
innocent
pantheism
she
used
to
fancy
that
flowers
had
spirits
or
some
instinct
that
enabled
them
to
enjoy
and
to
suffer
to
be
glad
in
the
sunshine
and
unhappy
in
the
cold
and
the
rain
she
fancied
that
perfume
was
their
language
and
that
they
conversed
in
it
as
birds
do
in
songs
and
chirpings
she
used
to
be
sorry
for
the
flowers
that
had
no
perfume
and
called
them
dumb
ones
connecting
their
fate
in
some
vague
pitying
way
with
that
of
two
deaf
and
dumb
little
children
in
the
village
but
the
she
pitied
most
of
all
they
came
in
the
when
everything
was
cold
and
dreary
and
there
were
no
kindred
flowers
to
keep
them
company
no
roses
no
bees
and
butterflies
to
make
music
for
them
no
nightingales
to
sing
them
to
sleep
in
the
scented
summer
nights
no
liquid
starry
skies
and
sweet
warm
dews
to
kiss
them
as
they
slept
their
pale
ascetic
little
slumbers
were
attuned
to
none
of
these
fragrant
melodies
and
franceline
loved
them
all
the
more
for
their
loveless
lonely
life
but
she
was
not
pitying
them
now
as
one
by
one
she
plucked
the
drooping
bells
and
the
bright
green
leaves
under
the
silver
hedge
she
was
envying
them
and
listening
to
them
every
flower
and
blade
of
grass
has
a
message
for
us
if
we
could
but
hear
it
the
woods
and
fields
are
all
tablets
on
which
the
primitive
scriptures
of
creative
love
are
written
for
us
life
is
to
be
like
ours
the
were
whispering
to
franceline
dwell
alone
in
cold
and
silence
so
must
you
we
have
no
sister
flowers
to
make
life
joyous
no
roses
to
gladden
us
with
their
perfume
and
their
beauty
neither
shall
you
roses
are
emblems
of
love
and
love
is
not
for
you
you
must
be
content
with
us
we
are
the
emblems
of
purity
and
hope
take
us
to
your
heart
we
are
the
heralds
of
the
spring
we
bring
the
promise
but
we
do
not
wait
for
its
fulfilment
you
are
happier
than
we
you
will
not
have
the
summer
here
but
you
know
that
it
will
come
hereafter
and
that
the
flowers
and
fruits
will
be
only
the
more
beautiful
for
the
waiting
being
prolonged
look
upwards
sister
and
take
franceline
listened
to
the
mystic
voice
and
as
she
did
so
large
tears
fell
from
her
eyes
on
the
white
bells
of
the
messengers
as
pure
as
the
crystal
dew
that
stood
in
frozen
tears
upon
their
leaves
de
la
bourbonais
had
not
heard
her
go
out
and
when
she
came
in
and
handed
him
her
bouquet
he
took
for
granted
she
had
gone
out
for
the
purpose
and
did
not
chide
her
for
the
slight
imprudence
angélique
was
not
so
lenient
she
was
full
of
wrath
against
the
truant
and
threatened
to
go
at
once
and
inform
on
her
which
franceline
remarked
she
might
have
done
an
hour
ago
if
she
had
any
such
intention
and
then
with
a
kiss
and
two
arms
thrown
around
the
old
mahogany
neck
it
was
all
made
right
between
them
franceline
did
not
venture
out
again
that
day
she
was
afraid
of
meeting
clide
she
strove
hard
to
forget
the
incident
to
stifle
the
emotions
it
had
given
rise
to
and
to
turn
away
her
thoughts
from
even
conjecturing
the
possible
cause
of
de
presence
at
dullerton
and
at
father
but
strive
as
she
might
the
thoughts
would
return
and
her
mind
would
dwell
on
them
she
was
horrified
to
see
the
effect
that
presence
had
had
on
her
to
find
how
potent
his
memory
was
with
her
still
how
it
had
stirred
the
slumbering
depths
and
broken
up
the
stagnant
of
her
heart
filling
it
once
more
with
wild
hopes
and
ardent
longings
that
she
had
fondly
imagined
crushed
and
buried
for
ever
was
her
a
sham
after
all
she
could
not
help
fearing
it
when
she
saw
how
persistently
the
idea
kept
returning
again
and
again
to
her
banish
it
as
she
would
he
come
to
tell
father
henwick
that
he
was
free
then
she
wondered
if
it
were
so
what
father
henwick
would
do
whether
he
would
come
and
see
her
immediately
or
let
things
take
their
course
through
sir
simon
and
her
father
then
again
she
would
discard
this
notion
as
impossible
and
see
all
sorts
of
evidence
in
the
circumstances
of
the
episode
to
prove
that
it
could
not
be
why
should
father
henwick
have
tried
so
hard
to
prevent
their
meeting
if
the
one
obstacle
to
it
were
removed
and
why
should
clide
have
been
so
restrained
and
distant
when
she
came
upon
him
suddenly
if
only
she
could
ask
this
one
question
and
have
it
answered
franceline
thought
she
could
go
back
again
to
her
state
of
stagnation
and
trample
down
her
rebellious
heart
into
submission
once
more
she
slept
very
little
that
night
and
the
next
morning
she
determined
that
she
would
go
out
at
any
risk
sitting
still
all
day
in
this
state
of
mind
was
unbearable
so
about
eleven
when
the
sun
was
high
and
the
frost
melted
she
put
on
her
bonnet
and
said
she
was
going
for
a
walk
to
see
miss
merrywig
as
the
day
was
fine
and
she
had
not
taken
cold
yesterday
angélique
made
no
difficulty
franceline
started
off
to
the
wood
and
was
soon
crushing
the
and
the
budding
primroses
as
she
threaded
her
way
along
the
for
some
mysterious
reason
which
no
one
could
fathom
but
which
the
oldest
inhabitant
of
the
place
remembered
always
to
have
existed
you
were
kept
an
hour
waiting
at
miss
before
the
door
was
opened
you
rang
three
times
waited
an
age
between
each
ring
and
then
keziah
the
antediluvian
factotum
of
the
establishment
came
limping
along
the
passage
and
after
another
interval
of
unbarring
and
unbolting
you
were
let
in
it
was
not
keziah
who
opened
the
door
for
franceline
this
morning
it
was
miss
merrywig
herself
shawled
and
bonneted
ready
to
go
out
my
dear
child
it
you
i
am
delighted
to
see
you
do
come
in
no
no
i
am
going
out
that
is
to
say
i
going
out
the
luckiest
thing
that
you
did
not
come
two
minutes
later
or
you
would
not
have
found
me
i
so
glad
no
no
you
are
not
putting
me
about
the
least
bit
in
the
world
come
and
sit
down
and
explain
all
about
it
i
imagine
what
is
keeping
keziah
and
she
knows
i
am
waiting
to
be
off
and
that
the
negus
will
be
getting
cold
though
it
was
boiling
mad
and
i
only
this
moment
put
it
into
the
flask
but
what
can
be
keeping
her
it
so
much
matter
in
fact
it
matter
at
all
only
i
promised
little
jemmy
torrens
you
know
mary
boy
on
the
green
well
i
him
i
would
make
the
negus
for
him

anything
except
from
me
poor
little
fellow
you

known
me
since
i
was
a
baby
i
mean
since
was
and
why
i
suppose
and
keziah

it
and
why
she
dallies
so
long
i
conceive
she
knows
i
leave
the
house
unprotected
and
go
off
before
she
comes
in
there

so
many
tramps
about
you
see
my
dear
it
provoking
of
keziah
me
take
the
negus
to
jemmy
said
franceline
when
there
was
a
break
in
the
stream
and
she
was
able
to
edge
in
a
word
will
explain
why
you
could
not
like
you
to
be
kind
my
dear
but
i
you
see
and
i
really
go
myself
what
can
keziah
be
about
go
and
i
will
wait
and
keep
the
house
until
either
of
you
comes
back
suggested
franceline
that
a
bright
idea
that
is
as
witty
as
it
is
kind
well
then
i
will
just
run
off
i
shall
find
you
here
when
i
return
i
be
twenty
minutes
away
and
you
can
amuse
yourself
looking
over
till
i
come
back
here
it
is
and
the
old
lady
rooted
out
a
book
from
under
a
pile
of
all
sorts
of
odds
and
ends
on
the
table
and
handed
it
to
franceline
down
now
and
read
that
nothing
i
enjoyed
like
that
book
when
i
was
your
age
and
indeed
i
make
a
point
of
reading
it
at
least
once
every
year
with
this
she
took
up
her
well
wrapped
in
flannel
to
protect
her
from
the
contents
and
bustled
away
any
one
rings
am
i
to
let
them
in
inquired
franceline
running
into
the
hall
after
her
no
certainly
not
unless
it
happens
to
be
langrove
you
would
not
mind
opening
the
door
to
would
you
the
least
but
how
shall
i
know
it
is
he
will
be
sure
to
hear
the
footsteps
first
and
the
click
of
the
gate
outside
and
then
run
out
and
peep
through
pointing
to
the
narrow
latticed
window
in
the
entry
you
must
be
quick
or
else
they
will
be
close
to
the
door
and
see
franceline
promised
to
keep
a
sharp
lookout
for
the
warning
steps
closed
the
door
on
miss
merrywig
and
went
back
to
but
she
was
not
in
a
mood
to
enjoy
philosophy
so
she
sat
down
and
began
to
look
about
her
in
the
queer
little
apartment
it
was
much
more
like
a
than
a
the
large
round
table
in
the
middle
was
littered
with
every
description
of
rubbish
the
letters
of
two
generations
of
miss
correspondents
old
pamphlets
odds
and
ends
of
ribbon
and
lace
little
boxes
bags
of
stale
biscuits
that
were
kept
for
the
pet
dogs
of
her
friends
when
they
came
to
visit
her
quantities
of
china
cats
and
worsted
monkeys
samplers
made
for
her
by
newspapers
of
the
year
one
tracts
and
books
of
hymns
all
huddled
together
fifty
smoke
and
had
painted
the
ceiling
all
over
in
dense
black
clouds
and
the
cobwebs
of
innumerable
defunct
spiders
festooned
the
cornices
the
carpet
had
half
a
century
ago
been
bright
with
poppies
and
bluebells
and
ferns
but
these
vanities
like
the
memory
of
the
unrighteous
man
had
been
blotted
out
and
had
left
no
trace
behind
them
franceline
was
considering
how
singular
it
was
that
anything
so
bright
and
simple
and
happy
as
miss
merrywig
should
be
the
presiding
genius
of
this
abode
of
incongruous
rubbish
and
wishing
she
could
make
a
clean
sweep
of
it
all
and
tidy
the
place
a
little
when
her
attention
was
roused
by
a
sound
of
footsteps
she
ran
out
at
once
to
look
through
the
lattice
but
she
had
waited
too
long
there
was
only
time
to
shrink
behind
the
door
when
the
visitors
had
come
up
and
the
bell
was
sounding
through
the
cottage
there
were
two
persons
if
not
more
she
knew
this
by
the
footsteps
presently
some
one
spoke
it
was
charlton
he
was
continuing
in
a
low
voice
a
conversation
already
begun
then
another
voice
answered
speaking
in
a
still
lower
key
but
every
word
was
distinctly
audible
through
the
open
casement
which
was
so
covered
by
an
outer
iron
bar
and
the
straggling
stem
of
a
japonica
that
no
one
from
the
outside
would
see
that
it
was
open
unless
they
looked
very
close
the
words
franceline
overheard
had
nothing
in
them
to
make
her
turn
pale
but
the
voice
was
clide
de
what
fatality
was
this
that
brought
them
so
near
again
and
yet
kept
them
apart
and
condemned
her
to
hide
and
listen
to
him
like
an
eavesdropper
there
was
a
pause
after
the
first
ring
charlton
knew
the
ways
of
the
house
he
said
something
laughingly
and
rang
again
then
they
reverted
to
the
conversation
that
had
been
interrupted
good
god
did
ears
deceive
her
or
what
were
these
words
she
heard
coupled
with
her
name
she
put
her
hand
to
her
lips
with
a
sudden
movement
to
stifle
the
cry
that
leaped
up
from
her
heart
of
hearts
she
heard
clide
giving
an
emphatic
denial
believe
it
i
tell
you
it
is
some
mistake
one
of
those
unaccountable
mistakes
that
we
explain
or
understand
but
which
we
must
be
she
could
not
catch
what
charlton
said
but
he
was
evidently
dissenting
from
clide
and
muttered
something
about
convicted
on
his
own
showing
which
the
other
answered
with
an
impatient
exclamation
the
drift
of
which
franceline
could
not
seize
neither
could
she
make
sense
out
of
the
short
comments
that
followed
they
referred
to
some
facts
or
circumstances
that
were
clear
to
the
speakers
but
only
bewildered
her
more
and
more
strikes
me
the
old
lady
does
not
mean
to
let
us
in
at
all
this
time
said
charlton
and
he
gave
another
violent
pull
to
the
bell
be
any
one
in
the
house
said
clide
after
a
pause
that
exhausted
the
patience
of
both
may
as
well
come
away
i
will
call
later
i
must
see
her
the
rest
of
the
sentence
was
lost
as
the
two
speakers
walked
down
the
conversing
in
the
same
low
tones
franceline
did
not
move
even
when
the
sound
of
their
steps
had
long
died
away
she
seemed
turned
to
stone
and
did
not
stir
from
the
spot
until
keziah
came
back
she
gave
her
a
message
for
miss
merrywig
left
the
cottage
and
went
home
she
found
her
father
just
as
she
had
left
him
busy
at
his
desk
with
books
and
papers
strewn
on
the
table
beside
him
she
saw
this
through
the
window
but
did
not
go
in
to
him
she
could
not
go
at
once
and
speak
to
him
as
if
nothing
had
happened
in
the
interval
she
went
to
her
room
and
remained
there
until
and
then
came
down
to
see
some
alteration
in
him
corresponding
with
what
had
taken
place
in
her
own
mind
but
he
was
gentle
and
serene
as
usual
no
mental
disturbance
was
visible
on
his
features
at
least
she
did
not
see
it
looking
at
him
nevertheless
with
perceptions
quickened
by
what
she
had
heard
since
they
parted
it
struck
her
that
his
eyes
were
sunk
and
dim
as
if
from
overwork
and
want
of
sleep
combined
but
there
was
no
cloud
of
shame
or
humiliation
on
his
brow
never
had
that
dear
head
seemed
so
venerable
never
had
such
a
halo
of
nobleness
and
goodness
encircled
it
in
his
eyes
as
at
this
moment
she
did
not
tease
him
to
come
out
to
walk
with
her
but
asked
him
to
read
aloud
to
her
for
an
hour
while
she
worked
it
was
a
long
time
more
than
a
week
since
they
had
had
any
reading
aloud
raymond
complied
with
the
request
but
soon
returned
to
his
work
franceline
expected
that
father
henwick
would
call
and
kept
nervously
looking
out
of
the
window
from
time
to
time
but
the
day
wore
on
and
the
evening
and
he
did
not
come
she
did
not
know
whether
to
be
glad
or
sorry
she
was
in
that
frame
of
feeling
when
the
gentlest
touch
of
sympathy
would
have
stung
her
like
the
bite
of
a
snake
it
was
not
sympathy
she
wanted
but
a
voice
to
join
with
her
in
passionate
contempt
for
the
liars
who
had
dared
to
slander
her
father
and
in
indignant
denunciation
of
the
lie
she
wanted
to
fling
it
in
the
teeth
of
those
who
had
uttered
it
if
father
henwick
would
help
her
to
do
this
let
him
come
if
not
let
him
leave
her
alone
let
no
one
come
near
her
with
words
of
pity
pity
for
her
now
meant
contempt
for
her
father
she
would
resent
it
as
a
lioness
might
resent
the
food
that
was
thrown
to
her
in
place
of
the
cubs
she
had
been
robbed
of
no
love
no
not
the
best
and
noblest
she
had
ever
dreamed
of
would
compensate
her
for
the
absence
of
reverence
and
respect
for
her
father
but
clide
did
not
suspect
him
she
had
heard
him
indignantly
spurn
the
idea
no
more
stole
it
than
you
did
he
had
said
stolen
what
would
no
one
come
to
tell
her
what
it
all
meant
would
not
clide
come
was
he
still
at
dullerton
was
there
any
fear
or
hope
of
her
meeting
him
again
if
she
went
out
she
might
have
gone
with
impunity
clide
was
far
enough
away
on
a
very
different
errand
from
that
which
had
brought
him
yesterday
across
her
path
on
coming
back
to
the
court
from
his
abortive
attempt
to
see
miss
merrywig
clide
found
stanton
in
great
excitement
with
a
telegram
that
had
arrived
for
his
master
that
instant
it
was
from
sir
simon
summoning
him
back
by
the
first
train
that
started
some
important
news
awaited
him
he
did
not
wait
to
see
miss
merrywig
but
took
the
next
train
to
london
and
arrived
there
in
the
early
afternoon
the
news
that
awaited
him
was
startling
enough
to
justify
sir
peremptory
summons
one
of
the
detectives
whose
sagacity
and
coolness
fitted
him
for
delicate
missions
of
the
kind
had
been
despatched
to
gather
information
in
the
principal
lunatic
asylums
of
england
and
scotland
he
had
come
that
morning
to
tell
sir
simon
harness
that
he
thought
he
had
found
de
winton
in
one
of
them
sir
simon
went
straight
to
the
place
and
after
an
interview
with
the
superintendent
telegraphed
for
clide
as
we
have
seen
it
was
an
elizabethan
in
the
suburbs
of
london
situated
in
the
midst
of
grounds
almost
large
enough
to
be
called
a
park
there
was
nothing
in
the
outward
aspect
of
the
place
to
suggest
its
real
character
everything
was
bright
and
peaceful
and
well
ordered
as
in
the
abode
of
a
wealthy
private
family
the
gardens
were
beautifully
kept
the
shrubbery
was
trim
and
neat
with
pretty
climbing
plants
rose
in
shady
places
inviting
the
inmates
of
the
fine
old
mansion
to
sit
out
of
doors
and
enjoy
the
sunshine
unmolested
for
there
was
sunshine
in
this
early
and
here
in
this
sheltered
spot
some
bits
of
red
and
gold
and
blue
were
peeping
through
the
tips
of
closed
nothing
externally
hinted
at
the
discord
and
disorder
that
reigned
in
so
many
human
lives
within
the
walls
the
sight
of
the
place
was
soothing
to
clide
he
had
so
often
pictured
to
himself
another
sort
of
dwelling
for
his
unhappy
isabel
that
it
was
a
great
relief
to
him
to
see
this
calm
abode
and
to
think
of
her
being
a
resident
there
a
matron
received
him
and
conversed
with
him
kindly
and
sensibly
while
they
were
waiting
for
the
doctor
to
come
in
the
latter
accosted
him
with
the
same
reassuring
frankness
of
manner
hope
he
said
your
informant
has
not
exaggerated
matters
as
that
class
of
people
are
so
apt
to
do
and
that
you
are
to
see
the
right
person
all
i
dare
say
to
you
is
that
you
may
hope
the
points
of
coincidence
are
striking
enough
to
warrant
hope
but
by
no
means
such
as
to
establish
a
am
too
much
taken
by
surprise
to
have
arrived
at
any
conclusion
replied
clide
i
have
been
too
often
disappointed
to
do
so
in
a
hurry
until
i
see
and
speak
to
the
patient
i
can
say
can
see
her
at
once
as
to
speaking
to
her
that
is
not
so
easy
the
sun
is
clouding
over
that
is
unlucky
at
this
his
visitor
looked
surprised
i
forgot
that
i
had
not
explained
to
you
the
nature
of
the
delusion
which
this
lady
is
suffering
from
continued
the
medical
man
is
one
of
the
most
poetic
fancies
that
madness
ever
engendered
in
a
human
brain
she
is
enamored
of
the
sun
and
fancies
herself
beloved
of
him
she
believes
him
to
be
a
benign
deity
whose
love
she
has
been
privileged
to
win
and
which
she
passionately
responds
to
but
there
is
more
suffering
than
joy
in
this
belief
she
fancies
that
when
the
sun
shines
he
is
pleased
with
her
and
that
when
he
ceases
to
shine
he
is
angry
the
sunbeams
are
his
smiles
and
the
warmth
his
kisses
at
such
times
she
will
deck
herself
out
with
flowers
and
gay
colors
and
sit
and
sing
to
her
lover
by
the
hour
pretending
to
turn
away
her
face
and
hide
from
him
and
going
through
all
the
pretty
coyness
of
love
then
suddenly
when
the
sun
draws
behind
a
cloud
she
will
burst
into
tears
fling
aside
her
wreath
and
give
way
to
every
expression
of
grief
and
despair
it
is
at
such
moments
when
they
are
prolonged
that
the
crisis
is
liable
to
become
dangerous
she
flings
herself
on
the
ground
and
cries
out
to
her
lover
to
forgive
her
and
look
on
her
kindly
again
or
she
will
die
very
often
she
cries
herself
to
sleep
in
this
way
i
fear
you
have
come
at
an
unfortunate
moment
for
the
sun
seems
quite
clouded
however
he
may
come
out
again
and
then
you
will
get
a
glimpse
of
the
patient
at
her
he
rose
and
led
the
way
upstairs
along
a
corridor
with
doors
opening
on
either
side
pointing
to
one
he
motioned
clide
to
advance
one
of
the
panels
was
perforated
so
as
to
admit
of
the
seeing
what
went
on
inside
when
it
was
necessary
to
watch
the
patient
without
irritating
her
by
seeming
to
do
so
or
remaining
in
the
room
at
first
the
occupant
was
standing
up
at
the
window
her
hands
clasped
while
she
conversed
with
herself
or
some
invisible
companion
in
low
tones
of
entreaty
then
uttering
a
feeble
cry
she
turned
mournfully
away
laid
aside
the
flowers
that
decked
her
long
black
hair
and
taking
a
large
black
cloak
drew
it
over
her
dress
and
sat
down
in
a
dark
corner
of
the
room
with
her
face
to
the
wall
crying
to
herself
like
a
child
clide
watched
her
go
through
all
this
with
growing
emotion
he
had
not
yet
been
able
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
her
face
but
the
small
light
figure
the
wayward
movements
the
streaming
black
hair
all
reminded
him
strikingly
of
isabel
the
voice
was
too
inarticulate
so
far
for
him
to
pronounce
on
its
resemblance
with
any
certainty
but
the
low
plaintive
tones
fell
on
his
ear
like
the
broken
bars
of
an
unforgotten
melody
he
strained
every
nerve
to
see
the
features
but
stay
she
is
moving
she
has
drawn
away
her
hands
from
her
face
and
has
turned
it
towards
him
the
movement
did
not
however
dispel
his
doubts
it
increased
them
it
was
almost
impossible
to
discover
any
trace
of
beauty
in
that
worn
haggard
face
with
its
sharp
features
its
eyes
faded
and
sunk
and
from
which
the
tears
streamed
in
torrents
as
if
they
were
melting
away
in
brine
the
skin
was
shrivelled
like
an
old
one
at
least
double
the
age
that
isabel
would
be
now
was
it
possible
that
this
wreck
could
be
the
bright
beautiful
girl
of
ten
years
ago
my
wife
was
mental
exclamation
as
he
looked
at
the
sad
spectacle
and
then
with
a
shudder
turned
away
see
you
are
unable
to
arrive
at
any
conclusion
said
the
doctor
when
they
were
out
of
in
an
adjoining
room
will
say
nothing
till
i
have
spoken
to
her
replied
the
young
man
evasively
can
i
do
this
can
not
possibly
fix
a
time
she
is
not
in
a
mood
to
be
approached
now
any
violent
shock
in
her
present
state
might
have
a
fatal
result
it
would
in
all
probability
quench
for
ever
the
feeble
spark
of
light
that
still
remains
and
might
bring
on
a
crisis
which
no
skill
could
alleviate
on
the
other
hand
if
we
could
apply
the
test
at
the
right
moment
the
effect
might
be
unexpectedly
beneficial
i
say
unexpectedly
because
for
my
own
part
i
have
not
the
slightest
hope
of
any
such
her
memory
quite
gone
or
does
she
recall
any
passages
of
her
past
life
accurately
accurately
i
fancy
she
seems
to
have
some
very
vivid
impressions
of
the
past
but
whether
they
be
clear
or
not
i
can
not
say
the
balance
of
the
mind
is
i
believe
too
deeply
shaken
for
clearness
even
on
isolated
points
to
survive
in
any
of
the
faculties
she
talks
frequently
of
going
over
a
great
waterfall
with
her
nurse
and
describes
scenery
in
a
way
that
rather
gave
me
a
hope
once
i
spoke
to
her
guardian
however
and
he
said
she
had
never
been
near
a
waterfall
in
her
life
that
it
was
some
picture
which
had
apparently
dwelt
in
her
might
have
his
own
reasons
for
deceiving
you
in
that
respect
observed
clide
name
you
say
is
when
people
change
their
names
they
sometimes
find
it
convenient
to
retain
the
initial
remarked
clide
he
went
home
and
desired
stanton
to
look
out
for
a
lodging
as
near
as
possible
to
the
asylum
a
tolerably
habitable
one
was
found
without
delay
and
he
and
his
valet
installed
themselves
there
at
once
the
very
next
day
he
received
a
letter
from
sir
simon
harness
informing
him
that
lady
rebecca
seemed
this
time
in
earnest
about
betaking
herself
to
a
better
world
and
had
desired
him
sir
simon
to
be
sent
for
immediately
the
french
de
who
wrote
to
him
said
they
hardly
expected
her
to
get
through
the
week
de
la
bourbonais
had
never
been
a
social
man
since
he
lived
at
dullerton
he
said
he
did
not
care
for
society
and
in
one
sense
this
was
true
he
did
not
care
for
it
unless
it
was
composed
of
sympathetic
individuals
otherwise
he
preferred
being
without
it
he
did
not
want
to
meet
and
talk
with
his
simply
because
they
were
his
there
must
be
some
common
bond
of
interest
or
sympathy
between
them
and
him
or
else
he
did
not
want
to
see
them
when
in
the
early
days
at
the
lilies
sir
simon
used
to
remonstrate
with
him
on
being
so
and
wonder
how
he
could
bear
the
dulness
raymond
would
reply
that
no
dulness
oppressed
him
like
uncongenial
company
he
had
no
sympathies
in
common
with
the
people
about
the
neighborhood
and
so
he
would
have
no
pleasure
in
associating
with
them
there
was
truth
in
this
but
sir
simon
knew
that
the
susceptible
pride
had
influenced
him
also
he
did
not
want
rich
people
to
see
his
poverty
if
they
were
not
refined
and
intelligent
enough
to
respect
it
and
value
what
went
along
with
it
he
had
studiously
avoided
cultivating
any
intimacies
beyond
the
few
we
know
and
had
so
persistently
kept
aloof
from
the
big
houses
round
about
that
they
had
accepted
his
determination
not
to
go
beyond
mere
acquaintanceship
and
never
stopped
to
speak
when
they
met
him
out
walking
but
bowed
and
passed
on
but
of
late
raymond
began
to
feel
quite
differently
about
all
this
he
longed
to
see
these
distant
acquaintances
as
if
they
had
been
so
many
near
friends
to
meet
their
glance
of
kindly
if
not
cordial
recognition
to
receive
the
homage
of
their
passing
salutation
it
was
the
dread
of
seeing
these
hitherto
valueless
greetings
refused
that
prevented
him
stirring
beyond
his
own
gate
he
marvelled
himself
at
the
void
that
the
absence
of
them
was
making
in
his
life
he
did
not
dream
they
had
filled
such
a
space
in
it
that
the
reflection
of
his
own
in
the
respect
of
others
had
been
such
a
strength
and
such
a
need
to
him
up
to
this
time
franceline
had
more
than
satisfied
all
his
need
of
society
at
home
with
the
pleasant
periodical
addition
of
sir
presence
while
his
work
had
amply
supplied
his
intellectual
wants
but
suddenly
he
was
made
aware
of
a
new
need
something
undefined
but
that
he
hungered
for
with
a
downright
physical
hunger
spirit
and
heart
were
too
closely
bound
up
in
her
not
to
feel
the
of
this
mental
hunger
she
could
not
help
watching
him
though
she
strove
not
to
do
it
and
above
all
not
to
let
him
see
that
she
was
watching
him
she
might
as
well
have
tried
not
to
draw
her
breath
or
to
stop
the
pulsations
of
her
heart
her
eyes
would
fasten
on
him
when
he
was
not
looking
and
she
could
not
but
see
that
the
expression
of
his
face
was
changed
a
hard
resolved
look
had
come
over
it
his
eyebrows
were
always
protruded
now
and
his
lips
drawn
tight
together
under
the
gray
fringe
of
his
mustache
she
knew
every
turn
of
his
features
and
saw
that
what
had
once
been
a
passing
freak
under
some
sudden
thought
or
puzzling
speculation
in
his
work
had
now
become
a
settled
habit
she
longed
to
speak
to
invite
him
to
speak
it
would
have
been
so
much
easier
for
both
it
would
lighten
the
burden
to
them
so
much
if
they
could
bear
it
together
instead
of
toiling
under
it
apart
but
raymond
was
silent
it
never
crossed
his
mind
for
a
moment
that
franceline
knew
his
secret
if
he
known
it
would
he
have
spoken
sometimes
the
poor
child
felt
the
silence
was
unbearable
that
at
any
cost
she
must
break
it
and
know
the
truth
of
the
story
which
had
reached
her
in
so
monstrous
a
form
but
the
idea
that
her
father
knew
possibly
nothing
of
it
kept
her
back
but
supposing
he
was
silent
only
to
spare
her
perhaps
he
was
debating
in
his
own
mind
what
the
effect
of
the
revelation
would
be
on
her
wondering
if
she
too
would
join
with
his
accusers
or
even
if
she
did
not
do
this
whether
she
might
not
be
ashamed
of
a
father
who
was
branded
as
a
thief
when
these
thoughts
coursed
through
her
mind
franceline
felt
an
almost
irresistible
impulse
to
rush
and
fling
her
arms
around
his
neck
and
tell
him
how
she
venerated
him
and
how
she
scorned
with
all
her
might
and
main
the
envious
malignant
fools
who
dared
to
so
misjudge
him
but
she
never
yielded
to
the
impulse
the
inward
conflict
of
lodgings
and
shrinkings
and
passionate
tender
cries
of
her
heart
to
his
made
no
outward
sign
raymond
sat
writing
away
at
his
desk
and
franceline
sat
by
the
fire
or
at
the
window
reading
and
working
day
after
day
the
idea
occurred
to
her
more
than
once
that
she
would
write
to
sir
simon
but
she
never
did
she
did
not
dare
open
her
heart
to
father
henwick
how
could
she
bring
herself
to
tell
him
that
her
father
was
accused
of
theft
it
was
most
probable
she
hoped
certain
that
the
abominable
suspicion
had
not
travelled
to
his
ears
and
if
so
she
could
not
speak
of
it
this
was
not
her
secret
it
was
no
breach
of
confidence
towards
her
spiritual
father
to
be
silent
and
the
selfish
longing
to
pour
out
her
filial
anger
and
outraged
love
into
a
sympathizing
ear
should
not
hurry
her
into
a
betrayal
of
what
was
even
in
its
falsity
humiliating
to
raymond
it
was
hard
to
refrain
from
speech
when
speech
would
have
been
a
solace
but
franceline
knew
that
the
sacrifice
of
the
cup
of
cold
water
has
its
reward
just
as
the
bestowal
has
peace
comes
to
us
on
surer
and
swifter
wing
when
we
go
straight
to
god
for
it
without
putting
the
sympathy
of
creatures
between
us
and
his
touch
langrove
had
never
been
a
frequent
visitor
at
the
lilies
but
franceline
never
remembered
him
to
have
been
so
long
absent
as
now
and
she
could
not
but
see
a
striking
coincidence
in
the
fact
she
knew
he
had
been
one
of
the
party
at
dullerton
that
night
and
if
as
she
felt
certain
that
had
been
the
occasion
of
the
extraordinary
mistake
she
had
heard
of
the
vicar
of
course
knew
all
about
it
he
believed
her
father
had
committed
a
theft
and
was
keeping
aloof
from
him
did
everybody
at
dullerton
know
this
langrove
was
not
a
man
to
spread
evil
reports
in
any
shape
franceline
knew
him
well
enough
to
be
sure
of
that
but
her
reputation
was
evidently
at
the
mercy
of
less
charitable
tongues
she
did
not
know
that
the
six
witnesses
had
promised
sir
simon
to
keep
silence
for
his
sake
but
if
she
had
known
it
it
would
not
have
much
reassured
her
a
secret
that
is
known
to
six
people
can
scarcely
be
considered
safe
the
six
may
mean
to
guard
it
and
may
only
speak
of
it
among
themselves
and
in
whispers
but
it
is
astonishing
how
far
a
whisper
will
travel
sometimes
especially
when
it
is
malignant
a
vague
impression
had
in
some
inexplicable
way
got
abroad
that
the
count
had
done
something
which
threw
him
under
a
cloud
the
gentlemen
of
the
neighborhood
were
very
discreet
about
it
and
had
said
nothing
positively
to
be
taken
hold
of
but
it
had
leaked
out
that
there
was
a
screw
loose
in
that
direction
young
charlton
had
laughed
at
the
notion
of
his
friend
anwyll
thinking
of
mlle
de
la
bourbonais
and
the
emphasis
and
smile
which
accompanied
the
assurance
expressed
pretty
clearly
that
there
was
something
amiss
which
had
not
been
amiss
a
little
while
ago
franceline
had
gone
out
for
her
usual
walk
in
the
park
it
was
the
most
secluded
spot
where
she
could
take
it
as
well
as
warm
and
sheltered
she
was
walking
near
the
pond
the
swans
were
sailing
towards
her
in
the
sunlight
expecting
the
bits
of
bread
she
had
taken
a
fancy
to
bring
them
every
day
at
this
hour
when
she
saw
langrove
emerge
from
behind
a
large
rockery
and
step
out
into
the
avenue
she
trembled
as
if
the
familiar
form
of
her
old
friend
had
been
a
wild
animal
creeping
out
of
the
jungle
to
pounce
upon
her
what
would
he
do
would
he
pass
her
by
or
stop
and
just
say
a
few
cold
words
of
politeness
the
vicar
did
not
keep
her
long
in
suspense
here
you
are
enjoying
the
sunshine
i
see
and
how
are
you
he
said
extending
his
hand
in
the
mild
affectionate
way
that
franceline
was
accustomed
to
but
had
never
thought
so
sweet
before
the
cough
quite
gone
quite
but
i
am
better
thank
you
angélique
says
i
am
and
she
knows
more
about
it
than
i
do
replied
the
invalid
playfully
is
everybody
at
the
vicarage
arabella
has
one
of
her
bad
colds
and
godiva
is
suffering
from
a
toothache
the
spring
weather
no
doubt
we
will
all
be
brisker
by
and
by
are
you
going
my
way
way
i
only
came
for
a
they
walked
on
together
how
is
de
la
bourbonais
said
the
vicar
presently
not
met
him
for
a
long
time
we
used
to
come
across
each
other
pretty
often
on
the
road
to
dullerton
not
poorly
i
hope
only
busy
so
dreadfully
busy
he
hardly
lets
the
pen
out
of
his
hand
now
but
he
promises
me
there
will
soon
be
an
end
of
it
and
that
the
book
will
soon
be
and
you
have
been
such
a
capital
little
secretary
to
him
said
langrove
next
thing
will
be
that
we
shall
have
you
writing
a
book
on
your
own
franceline
laughed
merrily
at
this
conceit
her
fears
were
if
not
banished
by
his
cordial
manner
sufficiently
allayed
to
rid
her
of
her
momentary
awkwardness
they
were
soon
chatting
away
about
village
gossip
as
if
nothing
were
amiss
with
either
brought
home
news
from
the
market
a
few
days
ago
that
tobes
was
going
to
marry
miss
bulpit
is
it
true
inquired
the
young
girl
too
good
to
be
true
said
the
vicar
shaking
his
head
report
has
been
spread
so
often
that
this
time
i
very
nearly
believed
in
it
however
i
saw
miss
bulpit
and
she
dispelled
the
illusion
at
once
and
i
fear
for
would
it
have
been
such
a
good
thing
if
they
got
married
would
be
a
very
desirable
event
in
some
ways
said
langrove
with
a
peculiar
smile
would
give
her
something
to
do
and
some
one
to
look
after
it
would
have
been
a
good
thing
for
tobes
too
would
it
not
he
is
so
poor
just
why
she
have
him
poor
fellow
when
he
proposed
she
told
me
the
story
herself
and
i
find
she
is
telling
it
right
and
left
so
there
is
no
breach
of
confidence
in
repeating
it
when
he
proposed
miss
bulpit
asked
him
how
much
money
he
had
she
said
have
only
just
enough
for
one
but
that
was
a
shame
she
has
plenty
for
two
and
besides
it
was
unfeeling
you
think
it
was
inquired
franceline
looking
up
at
the
vicar
but
he
evidently
did
not
share
either
her
indignation
against
miss
bulpit
or
her
pity
for
the
discarded
lover
he
was
laughing
quietly
as
if
he
enjoyed
the
joke
they
reached
the
gate
going
out
on
the
while
thus
pleasantly
chatting
i
suppose
we
must
say
said
langrove
is
my
way
i
am
going
to
pay
a
sick
visit
down
in
the
they
shook
hands
and
franceline
turned
back
you
give
my
compliments
to
the
count
said
the
vicar
calling
after
her
him
i
dare
go
near
him
as
he
is
so
busy
but
if
he
likes
me
to
drop
in
of
an
evening
let
him
send
me
word
by
you
and
be
delighted
he
nodded
to
her
and
closed
the
gate
behind
him
did
not
dare
because
he
is
so
busy
repeated
franceline
as
she
walked
on
did
he
know
papa
was
busy
it
was
i
who
told
him
so
a
few
minutes
ago
that
was
an
she
gave
the
message
nevertheless
on
coming
home
scarcely
daring
to
look
at
her
father
while
she
did
so
i
tell
him
to
come
in
one
of
these
evenings
petit
père
i
can
not
be
disturbed
at
present
was
the
peremptory
answer
and
heart
sank
again
she
told
him
the
gossip
about
miss
bulpit
and
tobes
thinking
it
would
amuse
him
he
used
to
listen
complacently
to
the
little
bits
of
gossip
she
brought
in
about
their
neighbors
raymond
had
the
charming
faculty
common
to
great
men
and
learned
men
of
being
easily
and
innocently
amused
but
he
seemed
to
have
lost
it
of
late
he
listened
to
chatter
with
an
absent
air
as
if
he
hardly
took
it
in
and
before
she
had
done
he
made
some
irrelevant
remark
that
proved
he
had
not
been
attending
to
what
she
was
saying
then
he
had
got
into
a
way
of
repeating
himself
of
saying
the
same
thing
two
or
three
times
over
at
an
interval
of
an
hour
or
so
sometimes
even
less
franceline
attributed
these
things
to
the
concentration
of
his
thoughts
on
his
work
and
to
his
being
so
entirely
absorbed
in
it
as
not
to
pay
attention
to
anything
that
did
not
directly
concern
it
she
was
too
inexperienced
to
see
therein
symptoms
of
a
more
alarming
nature
de
la
bourbonais
had
all
his
life
complained
of
being
a
bad
sleeper
but
angélique
who
suffered
from
the
same
infirmity
always
declared
that
he
only
imagined
he
did
not
sleep
that
she
was
tossing
on
her
pillow
listening
to
him
snoring
when
he
said
he
had
been
wide
awake
the
count
on
his
side
was
sceptical
about
nights
and
privately
confided
to
franceline
that
he
knew
for
a
fact
she
was
fast
asleep
often
when
she
fancied
in
the
morning
she
had
been
awake
some
people
are
very
touchy
at
being
doubted
when
they
say
they
have
not
an
eye
all
angélique
resented
a
doubt
on
her
bitterly
and
franceline
who
from
childhood
had
been
the
confidant
of
both
parties
found
an
early
exercise
for
tact
and
discretion
in
keeping
the
peace
between
them
the
discrepancies
in
the
two
accounts
of
their
respective
vigils
often
gave
rise
to
little
tiffs
between
herself
and
angélique
who
would
insist
upon
knowing
what
le
comte
had
said
about
night
so
that
franceline
was
compelled
to
aggravate
her
whether
she
would
or
not
she
her
better
than
to
have
words
with
le
comte
but
she
had
it
out
with
franceline
says
he
get
to
sleep
till
past
two
this
morning
does
he
humph
i
only
wish
i
had
slept
half
as
well
i
know
pauvre
cher
homme
he
drops
off
the
minute
his
head
is
on
the
pillow
and
then
dreams
that
wide
awake
how
it
is
why
this
morning
i
was
up
and
lighted
my
candle
at
ten
minutes
to
two
and
he
was
sleeping
as
sound
as
a
wooden
shoe
i
heard
franceline
would
soothe
her
by
saying
she
quite
believed
her
but
as
she
said
the
same
thing
to
le
comte
and
as
angélique
generally
overheard
her
saying
so
this
seeming
credulity
only
aggravated
her
the
more
laterly
raymond
had
taken
up
a
small
celestial
globe
to
his
room
for
the
purpose
he
said
of
utilizing
his
long
vigils
by
studying
the
face
of
the
heavens
during
the
clear
starry
nights
and
he
would
give
the
result
of
his
nocturnal
contemplations
to
franceline
at
breakfast
next
morning
angélique
being
either
in
the
room
pouring
out
the
hot
milk
for
her
coffee
or
in
the
kitchen
with
the
door
ajar
so
that
she
had
the
benefit
of
the
conversation
the
pantomimes
that
were
performed
at
these
times
were
a
severe
trial
to
gravity
angélique
would
stand
behind
chair
holding
up
her
hands
aghast
or
stuffing
her
apron
into
her
mouth
so
as
not
to
explode
in
disrespectful
laughter
sometimes
she
would
shake
her
flaps
at
him
with
an
air
of
despondency
too
deep
for
words
and
then
walk
out
of
the
room
heard
le
comte
telling
that
he
saw
the
three
kings
the
popular
name
for
belt
in
french
shining
so
bright
this
morning
at
three
i
believe
you
he
saw
them
in
his
sleep
i
was
up
and
walking
about
my
room
at
that
hour
and
it
so
happened
that
i
opened
my
door
to
let
in
the
air
as
the
clock
in
the
was
striking
three
as
would
have
it
raymond
overheard
this
confidential
comment
which
angélique
was
making
to
franceline
under
the
porch
not
seeing
that
the
window
was
open
good
angélique
said
the
count
putting
his
head
out
of
the
window
must
have
opened
the
door
two
seconds
too
late
it
was
striking
five
most
likely
and
you
only
heard
the
last
three
strokes
i
suspect
you
were
sound
asleep
at
the
hour
i
was
looking
at
the
three
as
if
i
were
an
infant
not
to
know
when
i
wake
and
when
i
sleep
said
angélique
with
a
shrug
was
le
comte
that
was
asleep
and
dreaming
that
he
saw
the
three
but
i
lighted
my
candle
it
was
when
i
got
up
to
set
the
globe
argued
de
la
bourbonais
le
comte
that
he
got
up
and
lighted
his
candle
corrected
the
incorrigible
sceptic
raymond
laughed
and
gave
it
up
but
it
was
true
notwithstanding
obstinate
incredulity
that
he
did
pass
many
white
nights
now
and
the
wakefulness
was
insensibly
and
imperceptibly
telling
on
his
health
it
was
a
curious
fact
too
that
the
more
the
want
of
sleep
was
injuring
him
the
less
he
was
conscious
of
suffering
from
it
he
had
been
passionately
fond
of
astronomy
in
his
youth
and
he
had
resumed
the
study
with
something
of
youthful
zest
enjoying
the
observation
of
the
starry
constellations
in
the
bright
midnight
silence
with
a
sense
of
repose
and
communion
with
those
brilliant
worlds
that
surprised
and
delighted
himself
perhaps
the
feeling
that
he
was
now
cut
off
from
possible
communion
with
his
threw
him
more
on
nature
for
companionship
urging
him
to
seek
on
her
glorious
brow
for
the
smiles
that
human
faces
denied
him
and
to
accept
her
loving
fellowship
in
lieu
of
the
sympathy
that
his
brothers
refused
him
but
rich
and
inexhaustible
as
the
treasures
of
the
great
mother
are
they
are
at
best
but
a
compensation
nothing
but
human
love
and
human
intercourse
can
satisfy
the
cravings
of
a
human
heart
raymond
was
beginning
to
realize
this
his
forced
isolation
was
becoming
poignantly
oppressive
to
him
he
longed
to
see
sir
simon
to
hear
his
voice
to
feel
the
warm
clasp
of
his
hand
he
longed
above
all
to
get
back
his
old
feeling
of
gratitude
to
him
raymond
little
suspected
what
a
moral
benefactor
his
friend
had
been
to
him
all
those
years
when
he
was
perpetually
offering
services
that
were
so
seldom
accepted
sir
simon
was
all
the
time
feeding
his
heart
with
the
milk
of
human
kindness
making
a
bond
between
the
proud
poor
brother
and
the
rest
of
the
rich
and
happy
brotherhood
who
were
strangers
to
him
raymond
loved
them
all
for
the
sake
of
this
one
nothing
nourishes
our
hearts
like
gratitude
it
widens
our
space
for
love
and
enlarges
our
capacity
for
kindness
it
creates
a
want
in
us
to
send
the
same
happy
thrills
through
other
hearts
that
are
stirring
our
own
we
overflow
with
love
to
all
in
thankfulness
for
the
love
of
one
this
is
often
our
only
way
of
giving
thanks
and
the
good
it
does
us
is
sometimes
a
more
abiding
gain
than
the
service
that
has
called
it
forth
it
was
all
this
that
raymond
missed
in
sir
simon
in
losing
his
loving
sense
of
gratefulness
he
seemed
to
have
lost
some
vital
warmth
in
his
own
life
now
that
the
source
which
had
fed
this
gratitude
was
dried
up
all
that
was
tender
and
kind
and
good
in
him
seemed
to
be
running
dry
or
turning
to
bitterness
the
estrangement
of
one
had
estranged
him
from
all
he
was
at
war
with
all
humanity
would
any
sacrifice
of
pride
be
too
great
to
win
back
the
old
sweet
life
with
its
trust
and
ready
sympathy
and
indulgent
kindness
why
should
he
not
write
to
sir
simon
he
had
asked
himself
this
many
times
and
had
written
many
letters
in
imagination
and
some
even
in
reality
but
angélique
had
found
them
torn
up
in
the
basket
next
morning
and
had
been
surprised
to
see
the
fresh
sheets
of
which
she
recognized
as
her
wasted
in
that
manner
and
thrown
away
he
knew
what
he
was
doing
probably
it
was
not
for
her
to
lecture
him
on
such
matters
but
she
could
not
help
setting
down
the
unnatural
extravagance
as
a
part
of
the
general
something
that
was
amiss
with
her
master
one
morning
however
after
one
of
those
white
nights
that
gave
rise
to
so
much
discussion
in
the
family
raymond
came
down
with
his
mind
made
up
to
write
a
letter
and
send
it
he
could
stand
it
no
longer
he
must
go
to
his
friend
and
lay
bare
his
heart
to
him
so
that
they
might
come
together
again
if
sir
silence
was
an
offence
was
not
free
from
blame
he
sat
down
and
wrote
it
was
a
long
letter
several
sheets
closely
filled
when
it
was
finished
and
raymond
was
folding
it
and
putting
it
into
the
envelope
he
remembered
that
he
did
not
know
where
the
baronet
was
if
he
sent
it
to
the
court
the
servants
would
recognize
the
handwriting
and
think
it
odd
his
addressing
a
letter
there
in
their
absence
he
thought
of
forwarding
it
to
sir
bankers
but
then
again
how
did
matters
stand
at
present
between
him
and
them
he
might
have
gone
abroad
and
not
left
them
his
address
and
the
letter
might
remain
there
indefinitely
while
raymond
was
debating
what
he
should
do
he
closed
up
and
stamped
the
blank
envelope
making
it
ready
to
be
addressed
then
he
laid
it
on
the
top
of
his
writing
desk
and
wrote
a
few
lines
to
the
bankers
requesting
them
to
forward
sir
address
if
they
had
it
or
could
inform
him
how
a
letter
would
reach
him
he
seemed
relieved
when
this
was
done
and
for
the
first
time
for
nearly
a
month
called
franceline
to
come
and
write
for
him
she
did
so
for
a
couple
of
hours
and
noticed
with
thankfulness
that
her
father
was
in
very
good
almost
in
high
spirits
laughing
and
talking
a
great
deal
as
if
elated
by
some
inward
purpose
her
glad
surprise
was
increased
when
he
said
abruptly
my
little
one
run
and
put
on
thy
bonnet
and
we
will
go
for
a
walk
in
the
park
the
day
was
cold
and
there
was
a
sharp
wind
blowing
but
the
sun
was
very
bright
and
the
park
looked
green
and
fresh
and
beautiful
as
they
entered
it
she
leaning
on
him
with
a
fond
little
movement
from
time
to
time
and
an
exclamation
of
pleasure
he
smiled
on
her
very
tenderly
and
chatted
about
all
sorts
of
things
as
in
the
old
days
of
a
month
ago
before
the
strange
cloud
had
drawn
a
curtain
between
their
lives
he
talked
with
great
animation
of
his
work
and
the
excitement
it
would
be
to
them
both
when
it
was
published
shall
go
to
paris
for
the
publication
and
then
i
will
show
thee
the
wonderful
sights
of
the
great
city
the
louvre
and
the
museum
of
cluny
and
many
antiquities
that
will
interest
thee
mightily
and
we
will
go
to
some
fine
and
get
thee
a
smart
french
bonnet
and
thou
wilt
be
quite
a
little
how
nice
it
will
be
petit
père
cried
franceline
squeezing
his
arm
in
childish
glee
many
learned
men
will
be
coming
to
see
you
will
they
not
and
writing
articles
in
praise
of
your
great
work
praise
i
know
not
if
it
will
all
be
praise
said
the
author
with
a
dubious
smile
will
not
approve
of
my
views
on
certain
historical
pets
i
have
torn
the
masks
off
many
heroes
and
replaced
others
in
the
position
that
bigotry
or
ignorance
has
hitherto
denied
them
i
wonder
what
simon
will
say
to
it
all
raymond
smiled
complacently
as
he
said
this
it
was
the
first
time
he
had
mentioned
the
baronet
franceline
felt
as
if
a
load
were
lifted
off
her
and
that
all
the
mists
were
clearing
away
is
sure
to
be
delighted
with
it
she
exclaimed
always
is
even
when
he
quarrels
with
you
petit
père
i
think
he
quarrels
for
the
pleasure
of
it
and
then
he
is
so
proud
of
you
they
walked
as
far
as
the
house
and
then
raymond
said
it
was
time
to
turn
back
it
was
too
cold
for
franceline
to
stay
out
more
than
half
an
hour
an
event
had
taken
place
at
the
lilies
in
their
absence
the
postman
had
been
there
and
had
brought
a
letter
raymond
started
when
angélique
met
him
at
the
door
with
this
announcement
adding
that
she
had
left
it
on
the
he
went
straight
in
and
opened
it
it
was
from
sir
simon
after
explaining
in
two
lines
how
clide
de
winton
had
arrived
in
time
to
save
him
at
the
last
hour
the
writer
turned
at
once
to
troubles
nothing
could
be
gentler
than
the
way
he
approached
the
delicate
subject
should
we
be
estranged
from
one
another
raymond
do
you
suppose
i
suspect
you
and
what
if
i
did
i
defy
even
that
to
part
us
the
friendship
that
can
change
was
never
genuine
ours
can
know
no
change
i
have
tried
in
every
possible
way
to
account
satisfactorily
for
your
strange
your
suicidal
behavior
on
that
night
and
i
have
not
succeeded
i
can
only
conclude
that
you
were
beside
yourself
with
anxiety
and
and
incapable
of
measuring
the
effect
of
your
refusal
and
your
conduct
altogether
but
admitting
for
sake
that
you
did
take
it
what
then
there
is
such
a
thing
as
momentary
insanity
from
despair
as
the
delirium
of
a
sick
and
fevered
heart
at
such
moments
the
noblest
men
have
been
driven
to
commit
acts
that
would
be
criminal
if
they
were
not
mad
it
would
ill
become
to
cast
a
stone
at
i
who
have
been
no
better
than
a
swindler
these
twenty
years
past
raymond
there
can
be
no
true
friendship
without
full
confidence
we
may
give
our
confidence
sometimes
without
our
love
following
but
when
we
give
our
love
our
confidence
must
of
necessity
follow
when
we
have
once
given
the
key
of
our
heart
to
a
friend
we
have
given
him
the
right
to
enter
into
it
at
all
times
to
read
its
secrets
to
open
every
door
even
that
and
above
that
behind
which
the
skeleton
stands
concealed
you
and
i
gave
each
other
this
right
when
we
were
boys
raymond
we
have
used
it
loyally
one
towards
the
other
ever
since
and
i
have
done
nothing
to
forfeit
the
privilege
now
all
things
are
arranged
by
an
overruling
providence
and
god
is
wise
as
he
is
merciful
yet
i
can
not
forbear
asking
how
it
is
that
i
should
have
been
saved
from
myself
and
that
you
should
not
have
been
delivered
from
temptation
you
whose
life
has
been
one
long
triumph
of
virtue
over
adversity
it
will
be
all
made
square
one
day
meantime
i
bless
god
that
the
weaker
brother
has
been
mercifully
dealt
with
and
permitted
to
rescue
the
nobler
and
the
worthier
one
the
moment
i
hear
from
you
i
will
come
to
dullerton
and
you
and
franceline
must
come
away
with
me
to
the
south
i
will
explain
when
we
meet
why
this
letter
has
been
so
long
then
came
a
postscript
quite
at
the
bottom
of
the
page
that
wretched
bauble
to
me
in
a
box
addressed
to
my
bankers
rest
assured
of
one
thing
you
shall
be
cleared
before
men
as
you
already
are
before
a
higher
and
a
more
merciful
many
changes
passed
over
countenance
as
he
read
this
letter
but
when
his
eye
fell
on
the
postscript
the
smile
that
had
hovered
between
sadness
tenderness
and
scorn
subsided
into
one
of
almost
saturnine
bitterness
and
a
light
gathered
in
his
eyes
that
was
not
goodly
to
see
but
the
feelings
which
these
signs
betrayed
found
no
other
outward
vent
de
la
bourbonais
quietly
and
deliberately
tore
up
the
letter
into
very
small
pieces
and
then
instead
of
throwing
them
into
the
basket
he
dropped
them
into
the
grate
the
fire
was
low
he
took
the
poker
and
stirred
it
to
make
a
blaze
and
then
watched
the
flame
catching
the
bits
one
by
one
and
consuming
them
is
fortunate
i
did
not
send
mine
was
his
mental
congratulation
as
he
turned
to
his
desk
intending
to
feed
the
dying
flame
with
two
more
offerings
but
where
were
they
raymond
pushed
about
his
papers
but
could
not
find
either
of
the
letters
angélique
was
called
had
she
seen
them
yes
i
gave
them
both
to
the
postman
she
explained
with
a
nod
of
her
flaps
that
implied
mystery
both
there
was
only
one
to
go
the
other
had
no
address
on
it
said
raymond
saw
it
le
another
mysterious
nod
yet
you
gave
it
to
the
postman
i
am
a
discreet
woman
as
le
comte
knows
and
he
might
have
trusted
me
to
keep
a
quiet
tongue
in
my
head
but
monsieur
knows
his
own
affairs
best
added
angélique
in
an
aggrieved
tone
good
angélique
explain
yourself
a
little
more
lucidly
said
de
la
bourbonais
with
slight
impatience
could
induce
you
to
give
the
postman
a
letter
that
had
neither
name
nor
address
on
it
me
i
thought
le
comte
did
not
wish
me
to
know
who
he
was
writing
to
gracious
exclaimed
raymond
too
annoyed
to
notice
the
absurdity
of
the
reply
how
could
the
postman
take
it
when
he
saw
it
was
a
blank
envelope
did
not
let
him
see
it
i
slipped
the
two
with
my
own
hands
into
the
bag
said
angélique
de
la
bourbonais
moved
his
spectacles
and
shrugged
his
shoulders
in
a
way
that
was
expressive
of
anything
but
gratitude
for
this
zeal
he
hesitated
a
moment
or
two
debating
what
he
should
do
the
only
way
to
ensure
getting
back
his
letter
immediately
was
to
go
off
himself
to
the
and
claim
it
before
it
was
taken
out
to
be
stamped
with
the
postmark
when
it
would
be
opened
in
order
to
be
returned
to
the
writer
there
might
be
no
harm
in
its
being
opened
the
postmaster
was
not
a
french
scholar
that
raymond
knew
of
but
he
might
have
a
friend
at
hand
who
was
and
who
would
be
glad
to
gratify
his
curiosity
as
well
as
exhibit
his
learning
by
reading
the
letter
raymond
set
off
at
once
so
as
to
prevent
this
it
was
the
first
time
for
some
weeks
that
he
had
shown
himself
in
or
near
the
town
and
if
his
mind
had
not
been
so
full
of
his
errand
he
would
have
been
painfully
conscious
and
shy
at
finding
himself
abroad
in
open
daylight
in
his
old
haunts
and
within
the
observation
of
many
eyes
that
knew
him
but
he
did
not
give
this
a
thought
he
was
calculating
the
chances
for
and
against
his
arriving
at
the
before
the
postman
had
come
back
from
his
rounds
and
handed
in
the
letters
to
be
marked
and
his
imagination
was
running
on
to
the
wildest
conclusions
in
the
event
of
his
being
too
late
he
walked
as
if
for
a
wager
not
running
but
as
near
to
it
as
possible
the
pace
and
his
intense
look
of
preoccupation
attracted
many
glances
that
he
would
have
escaped
had
he
walked
on
quietly
at
his
ordinary
pace
he
was
not
a
minute
too
soon
however
just
coming
up
as
the
postman
appeared
with
his
replenished
bag
de
la
bourbonais
hastened
to
describe
the
shape
and
color
of
his
blank
envelope
and
to
explain
how
it
had
come
to
be
where
it
was
and
was
most
emphatic
in
protesting
that
he
did
not
mean
the
letter
to
go
and
that
he
was
prepared
to
take
any
steps
to
prevent
its
going
there
was
no
need
to
be
so
earnest
about
it
the
postmaster
assured
him
at
once
that
the
letter
would
be
forthcoming
in
a
moment
and
that
his
word
would
be
quite
enough
to
identify
it
and
ensure
its
being
returned
to
him
it
seemed
an
age
to
raymond
while
the
letters
were
being
turned
out
and
sorted
but
at
last
the
man
held
up
the
blank
envelope
with
its
head
in
the
corner
and
exclaimed
jubilantly
it
is
the
count
seized
it
with
avidity
and
hurried
away
leaving
the
postmaster
at
his
excited
volubility
and
warm
expressions
of
thanks
there
was
no
necessity
to
rush
home
at
the
same
pace
that
he
had
rushed
out
but
raymond
felt
like
a
machine
wound
up
to
a
pitch
of
velocity
that
must
be
kept
up
until
the
wheel
stopped
of
its
own
accord
his
hat
was
drawn
over
his
eyes
and
his
head
bent
like
a
person
walking
on
mechanically
neither
seeing
nor
hearing
what
might
be
going
on
around
him
he
was
soon
beyond
the
streets
and
and
back
amidst
the
fields
and
hedges
there
was
a
clatter
of
horses
coming
down
the
road
de
la
bourbonais
saw
two
gentlemen
on
horseback
approaching
he
recognized
them
even
in
the
distance
at
a
glance
sir
ponsonby
anwyll
and
charlton
heart
leaped
up
to
his
throat
what
would
they
do
stop
and
speak
or
cut
him
dead
a
few
seconds
would
decide
they
were
close
on
him
now
but
showed
no
sign
of
reining
in
to
speak
ponsonby
anwyll
raised
his
hat
in
a
formal
salutation
charlton
looked
straight
before
him
and
rode
on
all
the
blood
in
his
body
seemed
to
rush
at
the
instant
to
face
he
put
his
hand
to
his
forehead
and
stood
to
steady
himself
then
he
walked
home
never
looking
to
the
right
or
the
left
until
he
reached
the
lilies
angélique
called
out
from
the
kitchen
window
to
know
if
he
had
made
it
right
about
the
letter
but
he
took
no
heed
of
her
only
walked
in
and
went
straight
up
to
his
room
she
heard
him
close
the
door
there
certainly
was
something
queer
come
to
him
of
late
what
did
he
want
going
to
shut
himself
in
his
bedroom
this
time
of
day
and
then
passing
her
without
answering
franceline
was
in
the
study
busy
arranging
some
primroses
and
wild
violets
that
she
had
been
gathering
under
the
hedge
while
her
father
was
out
a
noise
as
of
a
body
falling
heavily
to
the
ground
in
the
room
overhead
made
her
drop
the
flowers
and
fly
up
the
stairs
angélique
had
hastened
from
the
kitchen
to
ask
what
was
the
matter
but
a
loud
shriek
rang
through
the
house
in
answer
to
her
question
come
o
my
god
father
father
raymond
was
lying
prostrate
on
the
floor
insensible
while
franceline
lifted
his
head
in
her
arms
and
kissed
him
and
called
to
him
what
has
happened
to
him
father
father
speak
to
me
o
my
god
is
he
dead
she
cried
raising
her
pale
agonized
face
to
the
old
servant
with
a
despairing
appeal
no
calm
thyself
he
has
but
fainted
he
is
not
dead
said
angélique
feeling
her
pulse
and
heart
put
thy
hand
here
and
feel
if
he
were
dead
it
would
not
franceline
laid
her
finger
on
the
pulse
she
felt
the
feeble
beat
it
was
scarcely
perceptible
but
she
could
feel
it
must
lift
him
on
to
the
bed
said
angélique
and
she
grasped
the
slight
form
of
her
master
with
those
long
brown
arms
of
hers
and
laid
it
gently
on
the
bed
franceline
assisting
as
she
might
my
petite
thou
wilt
be
brave
said
the
faithful
creature
forgetting
herself
in
her
anxiety
to
spare
and
support
franceline
wilt
stay
here
and
do
what
is
necessary
whilst
i
run
and
fetch
the
she
poured
some
into
a
basin
of
water
and
desired
her
to
keep
bathing
her
forehead
and
chafing
his
hands
until
she
returned
this
after
loosing
his
cravat
and
letting
in
as
much
air
as
possible
was
all
her
experience
suggested
franceline
sat
down
and
did
as
she
was
told
but
the
perfect
stillness
the
deathlike
immobility
of
the
face
and
the
form
terrified
her
she
suspended
the
bathing
to
breathe
on
it
as
if
her
warm
breath
might
bring
back
consciousness
and
prove
more
potent
than
the
cold
water
but
raymond
remained
insensible
to
all
the
silence
began
to
oppress
franceline
like
a
ghastly
presence
the
cooing
of
her
doves
outside
sounded
like
a
dirge
could
this
be
death
his
pulse
beat
so
faintly
she
hardly
knew
whether
it
was
his
or
the
pulse
of
her
own
trembling
fingers
that
she
felt
a
chill
of
horror
came
over
her
the
first
vague
dread
was
gradually
shaping
itself
in
her
mind
to
the
most
horrible
of
certainties
if
he
should
never
awake
never
speak
again
never
open
those
closed
eyes
on
her
with
the
old
tender
glance
of
love
that
had
been
as
familiar
and
unfailing
as
the
sunlight
to
her
oh
what
a
fearful
awakening
came
with
this
first
realization
of
that
awful
possibility
what
vain
shadows
what
trivial
empty
things
were
those
that
she
had
until
now
called
sorrows
what
a
joy
it
would
be
to
take
them
all
back
again
and
bear
them
increased
tenfold
in
bitterness
to
the
end
of
her
life
if
this
great
this
real
sorrow
might
be
averted
franceline
dropped
on
her
knees
beside
the
bed
and
clasping
her
hands
sent
up
one
of
those
cries
that
we
all
of
us
find
in
our
utmost
need
when
there
is
only
god
who
can
help
us
father
thy
will
be
done
but
if
it
be
possible
if
it
be
possible
let
this
cup
pass
from
me
there
were
steps
on
the
stairs
it
was
angélique
come
back
she
had
only
been
ten
minutes
away
the
longest
ten
minutes
that
ever
a
trembling
heart
watched
through
but
franceline
knew
she
could
not
have
been
to
the
and
back
so
quickly
met
le
vicaire
just
at
the
end
of
the
lane
and
he
is
gone
for
the
doctor
he
was
riding
so
he
will
be
there
in
no
then
she
made
franceline
go
and
fetch
hot
water
from
the
kitchen
and
busied
her
in
many
little
ways
under
pretence
of
being
useful
until
carriage
was
heard
approaching
the
medical
man
was
not
alone
langrove
and
father
henwick
accompanied
him
angélique
drew
the
young
girl
out
of
her
room
and
sent
her
to
stay
with
father
henwick
while
the
doctor
assisted
by
langrove
and
herself
attended
to
de
la
bourbonais
what
is
it
did
the
doctor
tell
you
she
whispered
her
dark
eyes
preternaturally
dilated
in
their
tearless
glance
as
she
raised
it
to
father
face
could
say
nothing
until
he
had
seen
him
tell
me
my
dear
child
did
your
father
ever
have
anything
of
this
sort
happen
him
before
inquired
father
henwick
as
unconcernedly
as
he
could
never
that
i
heard
of
unless
it
may
have
been
when
i
was
too
little
to
remember
said
franceline
and
then
added
nervously
god
it
is
safe
then
not
to
be
so
serious
was
the
hearty
exclamation
god
you
will
see
him
all
right
again
soon
he
has
been
overdoing
of
late
working
too
hard
and
not
taking
air
or
exercise
enough
the
blade
has
been
wearing
out
the
sheath
what
it
is
but
blink
will
pull
him
through
with
said
franceline
laying
both
hands
on
his
arm
with
an
unconscious
movement
that
was
very
expressive
you
know
it
seems
to
me
as
if
i
were
only
waking
up
only
beginning
to
live
now
everything
has
been
unreal
like
a
dream
until
this
is
it
a
punishment
for
being
so
ungrateful
so
rebellious
so
blind
to
the
blessings
that
i
had
it
were
my
child
punishment
with
god
is
only
another
name
for
mercy
said
father
henwick
best
blessings
come
to
us
mostly
in
the
shape
of
crosses
perhaps
you
were
not
thankful
enough
for
the
great
blessing
of
your
love
for
his
health
and
his
delight
in
you
perhaps
you
let
your
heart
long
too
much
for
other
things
and
if
so
god
has
been
mindful
of
his
foolish
little
one
and
has
sent
this
touch
of
fear
to
teach
her
to
value
more
the
mercies
that
were
vouchsafed
to
her
and
not
to
pine
for
those
that
were
denied
we
seldom
see
things
in
their
true
proportions
until
the
shadow
of
death
falls
on
shadow
of
death
echoed
franceline
her
white
lips
growing
still
whiter
if
it
be
but
the
shadow
my
life
will
be
too
short
for
thanksgiving
were
i
to
live
to
the
end
of
the
here
they
come
said
father
henwick
opening
the
as
he
heard
the
steps
followed
by
on
the
stair
franceline
went
forward
to
meet
them
she
did
not
speak
but
blink
held
out
his
hand
in
answer
to
her
questioning
face
and
said
cheerfully
count
is
much
better
he
has
recovered
consciousness
and
is
doing
very
nicely
very
nicely
indeed
for
the
present
come
there
is
nothing
to
be
frightened
at
my
dear
young
franceline
could
not
utter
a
word
not
even
to
murmur
god
but
the
dead
weight
that
had
been
pressing
on
her
heart
was
lifted
she
gasped
for
breath
and
then
the
blessed
relief
of
tears
came
poor
little
thing
my
poor
franceline
said
the
vicar
leading
her
gently
to
a
chair
and
smoothing
the
dark
gold
hair
with
paternal
kindness
her
cry
it
will
do
her
good
said
blink
kindly
and
then
he
turned
to
speak
in
a
low
voice
to
father
henwick
and
langrove
he
had
concluded
from
the
incoherent
account
which
langrove
had
gathered
from
angélique
that
he
should
come
prepared
for
a
case
of
apoplexy
and
had
brought
all
that
was
necessary
to
afford
immediate
relief
he
had
recourse
to
bleeding
in
the
first
instance
and
it
had
proved
effective
de
la
bourbonais
was
as
he
said
doing
very
well
for
the
present
consciousness
had
returned
and
he
was
calm
and
free
from
suffering
franceline
was
too
inexperienced
to
understand
where
the
real
danger
of
the
attack
lay
she
fancied
that
since
her
father
had
regained
consciousness
there
could
be
nothing
much
worse
than
a
bad
fainting
fit
brought
on
by
fatigue
of
mind
and
body
and
now
that
the
rubicon
was
past
he
would
soon
be
well
and
she
would
take
extra
care
of
him
so
as
to
prevent
a
relapse
her
passionate
burst
of
tears
soon
calmed
down
and
she
rose
up
to
thank
her
visitors
with
that
queenly
that
formed
so
striking
a
part
of
her
character
am
very
grateful
to
you
for
coming
so
quickly
it
was
very
good
of
you
she
said
extending
her
hand
to
blink
i
go
to
him
now
no
not
just
yet
he
replied
promptly
would
rather
he
were
left
perfectly
quiet
for
a
few
hours
we
will
look
in
on
him
later
not
that
it
is
necessary
but
we
shall
be
in
the
neighborhood
and
may
as
well
turn
in
for
a
he
wished
them
and
was
gone
how
did
you
happen
to
come
in
just
at
the
right
moment
said
franceline
turning
to
father
henwick
did
not
occur
to
me
before
how
strange
it
was
was
it
some
good
angel
that
told
you
to
come
to
me
i
wonder
very
thing
you
have
hit
it
to
a
nicety
said
langrove
was
an
angel
that
did
said
father
henwick
falling
into
the
playful
vein
the
odd
thing
was
that
he
came
riding
up
to
my
house
on
a
fat
cumberland
pony
now
we
all
know
michael
has
been
seen
on
a
white
charger
but
this
is
the
first
time
to
my
knowledge
that
an
angel
was
ever
seen
mounted
on
a
cumberland
langrove
how
good
of
you
said
franceline
with
moistened
eyes
and
she
pressed
his
hand
you
not
better
come
out
with
me
now
for
a
short
walk
said
the
vicar
be
more
than
half
an
hour
and
it
will
do
you
good
come
and
have
early
tea
at
the
vicarage
and
we
will
walk
home
with
you
before
blink
comes
back
what
do
you
say
i
think
i
had
better
not
go
out
i
feel
so
shaken
and
tired
and
then
papa
might
ask
for
me
you
know
i
shall
not
go
near
him
unless
he
does
after
what
blink
perhaps
it
is
as
well
for
you
to
keep
quiet
dear
i
will
look
in
on
you
this
so
will
i
my
child
said
father
henwick
laying
his
broad
hand
on
her
head
and
the
two
gentlemen
left
the
cottage
together
to
be
continued
the
friends
of
education
to
pass
from
the
discussion
of
arguments
to
the
question
of
motives
is
a
most
common
yet
most
unjustifiable
manœuvre
of
popular
debate
this
is
usually
done
when
the
field
of
calm
and
logical
reasoning
has
become
tolerably
clear
the
flank
movement
is
attempted
as
a
final
struggle
against
defeat
otherwise
inevitable
if
the
motive
thus
impugned
be
really
indefensible
if
it
be
at
the
same
time
glaring
or
manifest
a
positive
advantage
is
sometimes
gained
by
a
vigorous
diversion
from
the
real
object
of
contention
but
if
such
a
motive
has
to
be
alleged
or
still
worse
invented
the
demonstration
against
it
however
violent
is
but
a
reluctant
and
ungracious
acknowledgment
of
defeat
and
a
flight
from
the
real
point
at
issue
the
most
recent
instance
of
this
sort
is
taking
place
before
the
american
public
and
has
been
afforded
by
those
who
endeavor
to
represent
catholics
as
opposed
to
free
and
liberal
education
thereby
attainting
the
motives
of
the
position
which
catholics
have
been
forced
to
assume
with
regard
to
what
are
falsely
called
schools
this
attitude
of
our
opponents
however
we
regard
not
without
complacency
our
object
is
not
war
but
peace
and
among
citizens
we
hail
the
present
violent
misrepresentation
as
a
sign
that
the
enemy
is
close
to
the
ditch
and
that
the
discussion
approaches
its
conclusion
when
this
final
effort
to
distort
the
catholic
object
and
to
asperse
the
catholic
character
has
exhausted
itself
and
been
held
up
to
the
inspection
of
the
american
people
we
shall
have
seen
the
end
of
the
we
insist
upon
an
improvement
in
our
educational
system
which
is
necessary
to
perfect
its
character
and
to
satisfy
the
requirements
of
the
times
the
present
system
does
not
meet
the
wishes
of
a
very
large
portion
of
the
community
is
unfair
to
others
besides
catholics
and
is
out
of
harmony
with
the
spirit
of
free
institutions
a
system
is
wanted
which
shall
at
least
be
equal
to
that
of
monarchical
countries
fair
to
all
citizens
alike
and
which
will
relieve
catholics
from
the
double
burden
of
educating
their
own
children
besides
paying
for
a
system
of
education
of
which
they
can
not
conscientiously
avail
themselves
the
correctness
of
the
catholic
position
is
so
manifest
and
is
so
rapidly
gaining
the
recognition
of
all
thoughtful
classes
that
those
who
are
unwilling
to
allow
catholics
equal
rights
as
citizens
are
forced
in
order
to
hide
the
truth
not
only
to
maintain
that
the
present
system
is
absolutely
perfect
and
incapable
of
any
improvement
but
to
accuse
catholics
of
harboring
ideas
of
which
they
are
not
only
innocent
but
which
it
would
be
wholly
impossible
for
them
to
entertain
such
as
that
they
are
afraid
of
the
light
that
they
attack
the
present
system
because
they
are
inimical
to
all
education
and
that
their
object
is
if
possible
to
do
away
with
it
altogether
accusations
similar
to
these
are
daily
repeated
garnished
with
rhetoric
and
sent
forth
to
alarm
our
and
to
encourage
them
to
turn
a
deaf
ear
to
whatever
catholics
may
say
the
weak
point
of
this
movement
against
us
is
that
the
people
will
notice
that
it
does
not
deal
at
all
with
the
validity
of
catholic
claims
and
that
it
shirks
the
only
question
at
issue
they
will
be
led
to
suspect
that
it
is
emphatically
a
and
the
mere
suspicion
of
this
will
awaken
curiosity
as
to
what
catholics
really
have
to
say
a
curiosity
fatal
to
the
success
of
the
flank
attack
in
the
language
of
those
who
advance
the
charge
with
which
we
propose
to
deal
education
means
either
primary
instruction
in
the
elements
of
knowledge
or
else
higher
academic
culture
such
as
is
to
be
furnished
by
colleges
and
universities
if
therefore
catholics
are
hostile
to
education
in
this
sense
of
the
word
they
must
be
opposed
either
to
the
general
spread
of
such
information
as
is
aimed
at
in
elementary
and
normal
schools
or
to
the
existence
and
growth
of
the
higher
institutions
of
science
and
art
we
are
perfectly
aware
that
there
is
another
meaning
given
to
the
word
education
to
which
reference
is
made
simply
in
order
to
avoid
obscurity
philosophers
of
the
class
to
which
huxley
belongs
understand
by
education
a
certain
specific
course
of
moral
and
intellectual
training
the
aim
of
which
is
to
ensure
its
pupils
against
ever
being
affected
by
such
impressions
are
to
be
made
upon
childhood
and
matured
in
more
advanced
stages
as
will
rid
men
of
that
natural
but
awkward
habit
of
reasoning
from
cause
to
effect
which
will
free
them
from
all
hope
of
any
life
but
the
present
and
any
fear
of
future
responsibility
in
order
that
they
may
be
impelled
to
devote
themselves
solely
to
the
analysis
and
classification
of
material
phenomena
since
this
is
the
only
purpose
of
existence
such
a
course
of
spiritual
defloration
as
was
practised
upon
the
tender
and
noble
genius
of
the
late
john
stuart
mill
the
results
of
which
as
manifested
by
the
revelation
of
his
biography
afford
in
the
words
of
an
ingenuous
critic
most
unpleasant
a
process
of
this
kind
is
not
education
it
is
a
heartrending
and
lamentable
destruction
of
that
which
is
noblest
and
most
essential
in
man
and
as
a
definition
has
not
yet
obtained
a
place
in
the
english
language
if
any
of
our
readers
would
care
to
know
our
own
ultimate
definition
of
education
we
should
describe
it
as
the
complete
and
harmonious
development
of
all
the
powers
of
man
in
reference
to
his
true
end
but
for
present
purposes
it
is
sufficient
to
adopt
the
ordinary
sense
of
the
word
as
meaning
the
diffusion
of
knowledge
by
scholastic
exercises
in
academies
and
colleges
if
it
appears
singular
to
enlightened
protestants
to
hear
a
demand
for
circumscription
and
discouragement
of
catholics
and
if
possible
the
suppression
of
religious
education
from
that
faction
whose
motto
is
and
light
we
trust
that
it
will
seem
none
the
less
paradoxical
to
hear
the
charge
of
favoring
ignorance
urged
with
most
vehemence
against
us
by
those
whose
boast
up
to
within
a
few
years
has
been
ministry
without
education
and
a
way
to
heaven
without
the
first
demand
does
not
in
the
least
surprise
us
coming
as
it
does
from
a
crude
and
undigested
assumption
of
the
principles
of
european
radicalism
we
have
seen
its
consistency
illustrated
by
madmen
chasing
robbing
and
killing
one
another
to
the
cry
of
equality
we
understand
what
it
is
to
be
assaulted
by
this
party
which
knows
not
how
to
act
except
in
the
way
of
destruction
which
is
never
at
rest
except
in
the
midst
of
agitation
and
never
at
peace
so
to
speak
except
when
at
war
nor
is
it
strange
to
see
an
attempt
against
catholics
made
outside
the
field
of
theological
controversy
inasmuch
as
the
result
of
controversy
for
the
past
two
centuries
has
tended
rather
to
the
disintegration
of
protestantism
than
to
the
conversion
of
catholics
to
the
new
faith
nor
is
it
surprising
to
find
this
assault
directed
against
the
equal
rights
of
catholics
in
education
for
here
some
earnest
but
men
imagine
that
there
is
not
simply
ground
to
be
gained
but
that
the
present
system
is
a
stronghold
not
to
be
given
up
it
is
a
stronghold
truly
but
rather
of
infidelity
than
of
protestantism
but
educated
protestants
and
heathen
will
marvel
with
us
that
the
attack
has
been
made
on
the
theory
that
protestantism
is
the
born
friend
and
catholicity
the
natural
enemy
of
education
knowing
as
well
as
we
the
fatal
evidence
of
history
the
contempt
for
education
which
until
more
recent
times
has
always
existed
to
a
certain
extent
among
the
orthodox
protestants
was
founded
upon
their
erroneous
doctrines
of
the
total
depravity
of
human
nature
the
consequent
invalidity
of
human
reason
and
the
principle
of
private
illumination
when
luther
said
god
moloch
to
whom
the
jews
immolated
their
children
is
represented
by
the
den
missbrauch
der
it
was
not
simply
on
the
ground
of
the
universities
being
centres
of
association
for
boisterous
and
disorderly
youth
or
fortresses
of
the
ancient
faith
but
because
of
that
and
impious
which
was
taught
in
them
in
his
furious
onslaught
against
them
luther
was
sustained
by
his
hatred
of
anything
which
tended
to
assert
the
prerogatives
of
human
nature
or
the
dignity
of
reason
no
man
was
ever
more
intemperate
in
denunciation
than
this
of
humanity
and
emancipator
of
human
believers
strangle
reason
said
he
and
he
never
alluded
to
it
except
in
terms
of
most
outrageous
abuse
the
last
sermon
of
his
at
wittenberg
is
monumental
in
this
respect
and
his
reply
to
the
anabaptists
is
one
of
the
most
startling
examples
of
his
intensely
idiomatic
style
the
feelings
of
the
master
were
fully
communicated
to
the
disciples
the
results
were
fearful
the
free
schools
which
existed
in
every
city
were
overturned
by
the
very
men
whom
they
had
educated
the
were
in
many
places
wholly
destroyed
in
others
so
reduced
as
never
to
recover
their
former
position
at
wittenberg
itself
the
two
preachers
spohr
and
gabriel
didymus
announced
from
the
pulpit
that
the
study
of
science
was
not
simply
useless
but
noxious
and
that
it
was
best
to
do
away
with
the
colleges
and
schools
the
upshot
was
to
change
the
academy
of
that
city
into
a
bakery
similar
measures
were
carried
into
effect
throughout
the
entire
duchy
of
anspach
the
history
of
the
reformation
by
döllinger
gives
a
long
list
of
the
numerous
scholars
rectors
of
high
schools
and
colleges
who
were
driven
into
exile
and
also
details
a
minute
account
of
many
of
the
institutions
which
were
destroyed
the
statements
of
erasmus
as
to
the
disastrous
results
of
the
reformation
on
studies
are
constant
and
numberless
they
may
be
formulated
in
a
sentence
of
one
of
his
letters
to
pirkheimer
regnat
lutheranismus
ibi
litterarum
est
lutheranism
reigns
there
is
the
destruction
of
the
testimony
of
sturm
schickfuss
bucer
and
others
is
no
less
forcible
luther
and
melancthon
in
later
days
seem
to
have
been
appalled
by
their
own
work
and
george
major
thus
sums
up
the
melancholy
condition
of
things
in
his
own
day
to
the
wickedness
of
men
and
the
contempt
which
we
ourselves
have
shown
for
studies
the
schools
have
more
than
ever
need
of
patrons
and
protectors
to
save
them
from
ruin
and
to
prevent
us
from
falling
into
a
state
of
barbarism
worse
than
that
of
turks
and
the
interesting
works
of
the
benedictines
of
maur
of
the
xviiith
century
the
bollandists
and
the
collections
of
a
few
other
catholic
scholars
have
preserved
nearly
all
the
material
that
is
left
from
which
to
construct
the
history
of
the
middle
ages
so
thorough
was
the
work
of
destruction
done
on
libraries
by
the
calvinists
and
huguenots
the
bodleian
library
is
but
a
fragment
a
few
torn
leaves
of
the
literature
which
was
weeded
out
of
england
by
the
enlightened
zeal
of
the
father
of
anglicanism
mad
work
this
coxe
did
in
oxon
while
he
sat
chancellor
by
being
the
chief
man
that
worked
a
reformation
there
i
have
elsewhere
told
you
says
anthony
wood
return
at
length
to
the
royal
delegates
some
of
whom
yet
remained
in
oxford
doing
such
things
as
did
not
at
all
become
those
who
professed
to
be
learned
and
christian
men
for
the
principal
ornaments
and
at
the
same
time
supports
of
the
university
that
is
the
libraries
filled
with
innumerable
works
both
native
and
foreign
they
permitted
or
directed
to
be
works
of
scholastic
theology
were
sold
off
among
those
exercising
the
lowest
description
of
arts
and
those
which
contained
circles
or
diagrams
it
was
thought
good
to
mutilate
or
burn
as
containing
certain
proof
of
the
magical
nature
of
their
what
was
left
undone
by
the
royal
delegates
was
thoroughly
attended
to
by
the
puritans
who
never
did
their
work
by
halves
and
whose
views
with
regard
to
the
bible
and
literature
bore
a
close
resemblance
to
those
of
the
early
mohammedans
in
their
comparative
estimate
of
the
koran
and
secular
writings
for
a
full
account
of
the
effect
of
the
revolution
of
the
xvith
century
on
learning
people
who
may
suspect
catholic
writers
of
exaggeration
can
compare
their
statements
with
those
of
the
learned
protestant
huber
in
his
exhaustive
history
of
the
universities
even
latimer
who
certainly
was
not
a
zealot
for
profane
learning
lifted
up
his
voice
in
complaint
would
pity
a
heart
to
hear
that
that
i
hear
of
the
state
of
cambridge
what
it
is
in
oxford
i
can
not
how
it
was
at
oxford
we
have
already
seen
throughout
the
length
and
breadth
of
the
land
the
monastic
schools
which
were
asylums
both
of
mercy
and
learning
were
destroyed
the
mere
list
of
their
names
as
given
by
the
protestant
historian
cobbett
occupies
one
hundred
and
pages
of
his
work
the
present
condition
of
the
lower
classes
in
england
which
is
due
to
their
being
thus
deprived
of
means
of
education
and
assistance
in
distress
is
the
nemesis
of
the
reformation
in
listening
to
the
demand
that
the
government
shall
dispossess
the
present
landlords
as
it
despoiled
the
churchmen
of
old
we
hear
arguments
of
fearful
power
as
to
the
extent
of
eminent
domain
when
it
is
asked
why
the
crown
and
people
shall
not
exercise
for
the
common
good
the
prerogative
which
was
conceded
and
exercised
formerly
for
the
benefit
of
the
crown
alone
the
present
holders
of
property
acquired
by
sacrilege
may
well
take
alarm
at
the
progress
of
revolutionary
ideas
and
the
question
as
to
how
far
the
people
were
forcibly
deprived
of
the
benefits
of
a
trust
vested
for
them
in
the
church
may
be
decided
constitutional
authority
and
through
god
avert
such
a
calamity
from
england
may
the
prayers
of
catholic
martyrs
of
more
and
fisher
intercede
in
her
behalf
and
save
her
from
the
consequences
of
that
act
to
prevent
which
these
her
truest
sons
did
not
hesitate
to
offer
up
their
lives
however
with
these
facts
in
view
it
is
scarcely
wise
for
english
protestantism
to
assume
the
position
of
a
necessary
and
perpetual
friend
of
popular
education
it
is
best
to
wait
until
the
ink
has
become
dry
which
has
scored
from
the
statute
book
of
that
realm
the
law
making
it
felony
to
teach
the
alphabet
to
catholics
it
would
be
gratifying
to
us
to
contrast
with
the
conduct
of
the
authors
of
protestantism
that
of
the
great
educators
of
europe
who
laid
the
foundations
of
our
civilization
a
fierce
and
violent
revolution
has
turned
that
civilization
aside
and
introduced
into
it
principles
of
anarchy
and
death
a
shallow
and
ungrateful
era
has
failed
to
perceive
and
to
acknowledge
its
debts
it
is
only
in
the
pages
of
scholars
such
as
montalembert
the
protestants
maitland
and
huber
and
the
author
of
that
recent
modest
but
most
charming
book
entitled
schools
and
that
we
begin
to
notice
a
thoughtful
inquiry
into
the
history
of
our
intellectual
development
the
masters
slumber
in
forgetfulness
and
oblivion
we
know
not
the
builders
of
the
great
structures
of
the
middle
ages
and
people
generally
know
almost
as
little
of
its
great
intellectual
and
social
system
the
history
of
the
human
race
for
a
thousand
years
of
most
intense
activity
is
summed
up
in
a
few
unmeaning
words
time
and
space
fail
for
such
a
comparison
but
the
fact
that
the
first
protestants
found
themselves
educated
the
fact
that
they
found
schools
to
denounce
and
to
destroy
in
the
xvith
century
is
sufficient
to
justify
us
with
regard
to
history
prior
to
that
date
it
would
also
be
a
pleasure
to
describe
the
progress
of
those
magnificent
bodies
of
catholic
educators
which
rose
under
divine
inspiration
as
a
check
to
the
wave
of
revolution
and
whose
successes
first
stimulated
the
action
of
protestants
by
the
wholesome
influence
of
fear
but
this
also
is
beyond
our
compass
we
are
ready
to
discuss
the
charge
that
catholics
are
opposed
to
education
independently
of
all
reference
to
protestantism
by
the
test
of
positive
facts
and
to
stand
or
fall
by
the
catholic
record
in
modern
times
it
is
not
necessary
to
cross
the
ocean
or
to
visit
countries
where
the
munificence
of
ages
has
endowed
the
universities
of
catholic
lands
as
for
instance
the
seven
great
universities
of
the
papal
states
ferrara
bologna
urbino
macerata
camerino
perugia
and
rome
each
containing
thousands
of
students
nor
is
it
necessary
to
remind
the
reader
that
the
great
protestant
universities
and
notably
those
of
england
are
to
use
the
expression
of
a
distinguished
anglican
prelate
legacy
of
the
charge
that
catholics
are
opposed
to
university
education
is
simply
laughable
considering
that
the
university
is
essentially
a
catholic
idea
and
has
never
even
in
europe
been
successfully
counterfeited
it
is
not
necessary
although
it
may
be
instructive
to
refer
to
the
free
schools
of
the
city
of
rome
which
according
to
the
testimony
of
a
protestant
traveller
thirty
years
ago
surpassed
even
those
of
berlin
in
efficiency
and
relative
number
they
were
before
the
recent
seizure
by
the
piedmontese
government
the
most
numerous
in
proportion
to
the
population
and
the
most
varied
in
character
of
any
city
in
the
world
they
presented
to
their
scholars
the
choice
of
day
or
night
with
regard
to
time
and
prepared
them
for
every
profession
art
and
trade
this
matchless
variety
was
doubtless
the
result
of
centuries
of
growth
but
it
was
also
the
spontaneous
outcome
of
zeal
for
education
and
laid
not
a
penny
of
taxation
upon
the
people
so
high
was
the
standard
of
gratuitous
education
that
private
schools
at
the
beginning
of
the
reign
of
our
holy
father
pius
had
to
struggle
hard
in
order
to
retain
the
patronage
of
the
wealthy
classes
at
that
time
there
were
in
rome
institutions
and
schools
for
free
education
of
these
last
were
for
little
children
of
both
sexes
of
the
remainder
were
devoted
to
males
and
to
females
the
total
number
of
pupils
in
elementary
schools
amounted
to
of
which
number
were
of
the
infant
class
of
those
more
advanced
were
males
and
females
in
elementary
schools
received
education
boys
and
girls
there
appears
however
in
cardinal
report
a
feature
which
has
never
yet
been
introduced
into
the
american
system
to
wit
in
paying
a
small
there
were
boys
and
girls
making
a
total
in
such
schools
of
this
last
item
may
furnish
a
hint
to
those
who
are
anxious
to
secure
the
attendance
of
poor
children
in
our
own
schools
although
it
is
scarcely
practicable
where
common
education
has
to
be
provided
by
taxation
alone
of
these
schools
to
which
we
have
referred
belonged
to
religious
communities
of
men
and
to
religious
communities
of
women
the
rest
belonged
to
or
were
conducted
by
seculars
besides
these
children
of
both
sexes
received
free
instruction
in
special
conservatories
in
addition
to
this
system
of
free
primary
education
there
was
the
vast
system
of
colleges
and
academies
connected
with
the
university
the
advantages
of
which
were
at
the
command
of
the
most
limited
and
humble
means
it
would
be
interesting
to
ask
some
of
the
graduates
in
this
country
the
simple
historical
question
in
modern
times
have
done
most
for
free
education
general
grant
has
doubtlessly
contributed
liberally
towards
it
so
it
is
to
be
presumed
has
blaine
so
have
many
other
distinguished
lecturers
on
the
subject
of
education
but
if
the
question
is
rightly
answered
the
date
will
have
to
be
assigned
much
earlier
and
joseph
calasanctius
venerable
de
la
salle
catherine
mcauley
and
a
hundred
thousand
other
will
have
to
take
precedence
of
our
illustrious
the
spectacle
of
one
christian
brother
or
ursuline
nun
or
sister
of
mercy
whose
life
is
devoted
to
the
instruction
of
the
poor
with
no
recompense
but
the
sweet
privilege
of
being
worn
out
in
the
service
of
for
the
sake
of
jesus
christ
such
a
spectacle
as
was
afforded
by
the
gifted
gerald
griffin
or
by
mother
seton
in
our
own
country
and
is
daily
shown
among
us
by
thousands
of
calm
intelligent
men
and
amiable
women
in
the
various
religious
orders
this
is
a
testimony
to
education
which
none
but
catholics
can
produce
and
yet
these
men
and
women
these
bright
martyrs
of
charity
are
they
whom
it
is
thought
good
to
attack
by
every
means
within
the
reach
of
calumny
let
it
be
understood
that
we
do
not
overlook
the
efforts
made
by
noble
men
and
women
in
the
ranks
of
protestantism
though
few
and
insignificant
in
intensity
of
zeal
when
compared
with
the
daily
and
common
sacrifices
made
by
catholics
nevertheless
it
must
be
borne
in
mind
that
these
isolated
attempts
have
been
ineffectual
save
only
in
so
far
as
they
have
produced
imperfect
copies
of
the
great
works
of
catholicity
protestantism
as
such
has
never
prompted
or
organized
any
great
attempt
at
general
free
primary
education
indeed
it
might
be
safely
challenged
to
produce
any
instance
of
the
kind
and
if
the
american
people
were
to
be
seized
with
remorse
for
its
injustice
towards
catholics
and
to
propose
immediately
to
do
away
with
all
public
schools
we
should
object
most
strongly
on
the
ground
that
no
adequate
means
would
then
exist
for
the
education
of
protestant
children
the
problem
of
general
education
has
never
been
faced
by
protestantism
the
system
of
godless
education
is
an
extremely
modern
and
thoroughly
pagan
idea
if
it
has
found
favor
among
the
leaders
of
protestantism
this
has
been
because
they
have
accepted
it
as
a
solution
of
the
educational
problem
not
having
given
the
matter
sufficient
attention
to
observe
the
ruinous
effect
which
it
is
producing
on
themselves
from
similar
thoughtlessness
comes
their
maintenance
of
the
present
system
it
is
a
comparatively
cheap
solution
as
far
as
individuals
are
concerned
it
calls
for
no
sacrifices
it
is
supposed
to
be
sufficiently
protestant
as
long
as
the
bible
is
read
in
the
schools
but
if
the
present
movement
of
the
infidel
party
succeeds
and
the
schools
are
reduced
to
purely
irreligious
institutions
the
matter
will
soon
force
itself
upon
protestant
attention
we
are
convinced
that
they
will
perceive
that
catholics
have
given
the
subject
much
more
consideration
than
they
supposed
and
have
been
right
throughout
many
of
them
will
regret
having
misunderstood
our
views
and
will
be
prepared
to
endorse
the
proposition
that
such
schools
are
subversive
of
christianity
and
demoralizing
in
their
tendency
they
will
then
endeavor
to
repair
the
evils
which
may
still
result
from
their
neglect
of
catholic
remonstrance
they
will
demand
to
be
put
upon
at
least
an
equal
footing
with
infidels
probably
with
as
much
vehemence
as
catholics
have
demanded
an
equal
footing
for
all
citizens
alike
if
they
find
themselves
hopelessly
debarred
from
this
by
the
radical
changes
in
the
constitution
which
some
of
their
number
are
even
now
proposing
they
will
impeach
these
amendments
this
failing
they
will
find
themselves
in
the
position
in
which
catholics
now
are
then
for
the
first
time
in
history
will
protestantism
have
a
fair
chance
to
show
how
much
it
cares
for
education
but
as
already
intimated
it
is
not
necessary
to
cross
the
seas
to
discover
testimony
in
rebuttal
of
the
gratuitous
slander
which
is
urged
against
catholics
nor
is
there
need
to
summon
from
the
tomb
the
teachers
of
those
who
founded
the
reformation
nor
to
institute
an
historic
comparison
between
the
labors
of
catholics
and
protestants
still
less
need
is
there
to
attempt
to
penetrate
the
future
as
to
what
catholics
may
do
for
education
when
they
are
relieved
of
of
their
present
twofold
burden
we
live
in
the
xixth
century
and
in
america
and
in
this
very
age
and
country
catholics
are
doing
more
for
education
than
is
actually
done
by
any
other
denomination
and
in
proportion
to
their
numbers
and
means
more
than
is
done
by
all
other
denominations
put
together
which
outnumber
catholics
by
at
least
four
to
one
catholics
forsooth
who
are
impudently
charged
with
being
opposed
to
primary
schools
and
collegiate
training
this
assertion
will
doubtless
sound
strangely
in
the
ears
of
those
who
have
allowed
themselves
to
remain
in
ignorance
of
the
facts
which
we
shall
presently
adduce
but
in
view
of
them
it
will
be
acknowledged
that
our
statement
is
the
most
modest
that
can
be
made
and
that
if
disposed
to
be
boastful
we
could
increase
it
many
fold
without
fear
of
exaggeration
catholics
in
this
country
have
it
is
true
no
great
university
such
as
those
produced
by
the
efforts
and
endowments
of
generations
besides
the
lack
of
time
necessary
for
such
a
development
two
other
causes
have
thus
far
prevented
its
origin
the
first
is
the
poverty
of
catholics
here
not
simply
their
lack
of
means
but
the
fact
that
the
extent
of
the
country
and
the
comparatively
small
number
of
very
wealthy
families
require
that
educational
institutions
of
the
higher
class
should
be
plentifully
distributed
secondly
catholic
resources
have
actually
been
applied
to
satisfy
this
condition
of
things
we
feel
quite
sanguine
that
before
the
close
of
the
century
in
spite
of
all
disadvantages
a
catholic
university
of
the
very
highest
character
will
be
established
here
but
without
it
there
exist
at
present
in
every
city
of
importance
throughout
the
union
colleges
which
for
scholarship
will
fairly
compete
with
the
chartered
universities
of
this
country
and
which
in
certain
localities
and
in
special
departments
will
surpass
their
older
and
more
pretentious
rivals
although
these
colleges
do
not
approach
the
ideal
of
a
university
a
great
city
of
learning
which
can
no
more
be
built
in
a
day
than
a
great
commercial
metropolis
nevertheless
there
is
no
reason
to
be
ashamed
of
our
colleges
scarcely
one
of
them
can
be
found
which
does
not
contain
the
children
of
sent
thither
by
the
preference
of
parents
and
guardians
our
great
academies
for
young
ladies
are
recognized
as
possessing
advantages
which
are
without
a
parallel
and
as
a
class
the
convent
schools
for
girls
are
without
even
a
rival
and
contain
a
very
large
proportion
of
protestant
children
nor
are
catholics
lacking
in
efforts
to
provide
primary
education
for
catholic
children
although
their
efforts
in
this
direction
are
sadly
out
of
proportion
to
their
necessities
in
higher
intellectual
culture
the
wealthy
are
naturally
interested
they
must
provide
suitable
education
for
their
children
to
do
this
in
every
place
is
a
most
severe
tax
upon
them
nevertheless
it
has
been
their
duty
to
accomplish
this
and
at
the
same
time
to
subscribe
liberally
toward
the
education
of
the
children
of
their
poorer
brethren
the
poorer
classes
also
with
less
natural
impulse
to
make
sacrifices
for
education
exposed
to
the
temptation
of
hundreds
of
proselytizing
institutions
forced
to
pay
also
for
the
lavish
expenditure
of
the
public
schools
have
had
to
bear
the
burden
of
procuring
the
necessary
instruction
for
their
children
without
exposing
them
to
sectarianism
and
the
scorn
of
their
religion
too
often
openly
manifested
in
the
schools
how
far
they
have
done
their
duty
will
presently
be
shown
honorable
men
shall
judge
whether
they
have
or
have
not
valued
education
but
if
it
be
suddenly
discovered
that
they
have
valued
it
let
it
be
acknowledged
also
that
they
have
acted
as
catholics
and
from
the
deepest
religious
motives
the
general
statistics
of
the
catholic
church
in
america
are
very
imperfect
nevertheless
from
the
of
a
few
figures
may
be
gleaned
which
will
abundantly
sustain
the
statements
here
advanced
it
is
to
be
regretted
that
the
statistics
as
given
in
the
are
not
more
complete
those
of
some
dioceses
being
quite
minute
and
exact
those
of
others
very
imperfect
with
regard
to
colleges
and
academies
for
higher
education
there
are
under
catholic
direction
in
the
united
states
at
least
with
an
attendance
of
not
less
than
pupils
in
dioceses
of
which
both
the
numbers
of
institutions
and
their
attendance
have
been
given
there
are
institutions
with
an
attendance
of
a
mathematical
computation
gives
for
the
attendance
in
the
others
the
amount
which
we
have
allowed
as
a
safe
estimate
a
total
attendance
of
no
less
than
souls
how
does
this
appear
to
those
who
have
listened
hitherto
to
the
revilers
of
catholics
are
we
right
in
repelling
their
charge
or
are
they
right
who
have
nothing
but
their
angry
feelings
with
which
to
sustain
it
if
catholics
are
wanting
in
zeal
for
education
the
spirit
of
obstruction
is
not
apparent
in
their
higher
institutions
but
as
we
have
said
the
mass
of
our
people
are
poor
what
provision
have
they
made
for
themselves
besides
paying
for
the
education
of
others
the
catholic
parochial
schools
are
principally
designed
to
supply
the
need
of
catholic
education
for
the
masses
it
would
be
wrong
however
to
consider
them
as
merely
primary
schools
many
of
the
parochial
schools
are
really
high
schools
and
have
a
course
of
studies
equal
to
the
best
normal
schools
nevertheless
under
the
head
of
parish
schools
are
not
included
any
of
those
already
mentioned
as
colleges
or
academies
in
the
archdiocese
of
cincinnati
there
are
parish
schools
in
which
are
educated
about
children
free
of
cost
to
the
state
in
the
archdiocese
of
new
york
there
are
parish
schools
with
not
less
than
children
in
the
diocese
of
cleveland
there
are
parish
schools
and
children
in
some
places
the
attendance
of
the
catholic
schools
is
fully
equal
to
that
of
the
public
schools
so
that
in
these
districts
catholics
not
only
pay
for
the
education
of
their
own
children
but
half
the
expenses
of
the
public
schools
and
supposing
both
systems
to
be
conducted
with
equal
economy
enough
to
pay
for
the
education
of
all
the
other
children
as
well
as
their
own
of
to
protestants
jews
and
infidels
and
yet
catholics
are
charged
with
being
hostile
to
education
in
the
united
states
we
have
statistics
of
parochial
schools
the
given
attendance
at
which
amounts
to
pupils
the
entire
number
of
parish
schools
foots
up
and
the
total
figure
of
attendance
may
be
set
down
at
scholars
add
to
this
the
number
of
who
are
being
educated
in
colleges
and
academies
and
farther
increase
the
sum
by
the
probable
number
of
children
in
asylums
reformatories
and
industrial
schools
and
there
will
appear
something
very
like
half
a
million
of
scholars
who
are
receiving
their
education
at
the
expense
of
catholics
taking
into
account
catholic
numbers
catholic
means
and
the
time
in
which
catholics
have
made
these
provisions
for
education
we
can
safely
challenge
not
only
every
denomination
singly
but
all
of
them
put
together
to
show
any
corresponding
interest
in
the
matter
of
education
whether
elementary
or
scientific
this
challenge
is
made
not
in
the
spirit
of
pride
though
certainly
without
shame
but
in
the
name
of
truth
and
of
generous
rivalry
to
outstrip
all
others
in
the
service
of
humanity
and
our
country
let
it
stand
as
the
fittest
reply
to
the
disingenuous
charge
that
catholics
are
opposed
to
education
the
candid
reader
to
whom
these
facts
are
new
will
use
his
own
language
in
characterizing
the
against
catholics
and
will
be
disposed
to
credit
us
with
honesty
and
consistency
in
our
open
criticism
of
the
present
system
of
education
but
we
are
persuaded
that
he
will
also
be
led
if
not
to
make
at
least
to
concur
in
farther
reflections
on
the
facts
which
are
here
adduced
if
catholics
are
actually
providing
instruction
for
so
vast
a
number
of
the
people
of
the
united
states
is
not
this
a
very
considerable
saving
to
the
public
we
think
it
is
the
average
cost
of
education
in
new
york
city
is
per
child
in
the
state
of
new
york
in
the
united
states
and
territories
the
saving
represented
by
such
a
number
in
our
schools
amounts
at
the
rate
of
new
york
city
to
at
the
rate
of
the
state
of
new
york
to
and
at
the
lowest
rate
to
per
annum
in
addition
to
this
direct
saving
we
must
be
credited
with
the
amount
of
our
taxes
for
the
public
schools
when
catholics
stand
before
the
american
people
and
state
the
reasons
why
they
do
not
consider
the
present
educational
system
that
prevails
here
to
be
either
wise
or
just
they
are
not
beggars
in
any
sense
they
ask
for
no
favor
they
demand
an
equitable
system
of
disbursing
the
funds
raised
for
education
so
that
no
class
of
citizens
shall
be
deprived
of
that
for
which
they
are
forced
to
contribute
they
would
arrange
it
so
that
none
could
justly
complain
as
catholics
we
must
have
religion
and
morality
which
whatever
others
may
think
are
to
us
inseparable
taught
in
the
schools
to
which
we
send
our
children
no
time
or
place
will
ever
alter
our
convictions
on
this
point
what
we
demand
for
ourselves
we
gladly
concede
to
others
we
are
ready
to
consult
with
them
on
a
common
and
just
basis
of
agreement
nothing
is
wanting
for
a
harmonious
settlement
except
fairness
on
the
part
of
our
opponents
there
is
no
flaw
in
our
position
no
evil
design
in
our
heart
nor
have
we
the
slightest
disposition
to
drive
a
close
bargain
let
the
word
be
spoken
let
any
of
the
protestant
denominations
make
a
step
forward
intimate
a
desire
for
settlement
on
the
basis
of
equal
justice
to
all
and
catholics
are
with
them
but
while
we
thus
maintain
our
demand
as
strictly
just
whether
it
be
received
or
rejected
we
are
not
debtors
but
creditors
of
the
state
we
not
only
ask
our
will
you
stand
by
and
see
us
taxed
for
a
system
of
education
of
which
we
can
not
conscientiously
avail
ourselves
but
we
further
ask
can
you
as
honest
men
disregard
what
catholics
are
doing
for
education
do
you
want
them
not
only
to
educate
their
own
children
thereby
saving
you
this
cost
but
to
educate
yours
also
what
kind
of
a
soul
has
the
man
or
the
nation
who
would
deliberately
resist
such
an
appeal
the
time
will
come
when
people
will
ask
as
indeed
many
do
ask
at
present
is
not
a
louder
outcry
made
for
the
catholics
in
the
school
question
and
the
answer
is
that
we
feel
a
certainty
which
nothing
can
shake
that
the
american
people
are
intelligent
enough
to
understand
catholics
after
a
time
and
when
they
do
understand
them
they
will
be
fair
enough
to
do
them
justice
in
the
meantime
let
the
catholic
laborer
pay
not
only
for
the
education
of
his
own
children
at
the
parish
school
and
save
this
expense
to
his
rich
neighbor
let
him
also
pay
for
the
same
children
not
merely
in
primary
schools
but
in
high
schools
where
ladies
and
gentlemen
whom
poverty
does
not
drive
to
labor
at
the
age
when
the
poor
children
have
to
be
apprenticed
may
learn
french
and
german
and
music
and
to
declaim
on
the
glorious
principles
of
american
liberty
and
of
the
constitution
under
which
all
men
are
supposed
to
be
free
and
equal
we
love
to
hear
their
young
voices
and
hearty
eloquence
let
these
institutions
be
costly
in
structure
and
furnished
with
every
improvement
let
the
teachers
have
high
salaries
let
gushing
editors
issue
forth
to
manifest
to
the
astonished
world
the
wisdom
and
deep
thought
which
they
have
acquired
at
the
expense
of
their
humbler
and
neighbor
but
let
honest
and
thoughtful
men
ponder
on
the
meaning
of
american
equality
and
judge
who
are
the
true
friends
of
education
the
wages
of
the
laborers
will
be
spent
if
the
shallowness
and
crude
imperfection
of
the
present
system
are
learned
and
the
spirit
of
equal
rights
among
citizens
peacefully
preserved
though
the
credit
will
belong
to
those
who
have
kept
their
calmness
of
mind
and
made
the
greatest
sacrifices
the
candid
reader
to
whom
we
have
alluded
will
readily
admit
that
catholics
are
true
friends
of
education
and
are
doing
most
for
it
proportionately
to
their
means
that
instead
of
suspicion
and
abuse
they
deserve
respect
honor
and
acknowledgment
of
their
services
we
think
however
that
our
will
go
much
farther
and
will
in
time
endorse
our
statement
when
we
affirm
that
catholics
at
present
and
as
a
body
are
the
only
true
friends
of
popular
education
by
this
is
not
meant
simply
to
say
that
they
have
not
been
backward
in
obtaining
by
their
intelligence
and
integrity
the
highest
positions
in
the
country
that
they
count
as
representatives
such
men
as
taney
charles
a
barry
at
the
head
of
the
navy
a
sheridan
and
a
rosecrans
in
the
army
and
others
of
the
highest
national
and
local
reputation
or
that
when
the
roman
purple
fell
upon
the
shoulders
of
the
archbishop
of
new
york
it
suffered
no
loss
of
dignity
in
touching
a
true
and
patriotic
american
well
fitted
to
wear
it
in
any
court
or
academy
of
europe
but
we
do
mean
that
outside
of
the
catholic
church
and
those
who
sympathize
with
our
views
on
this
subject
there
is
no
body
whose
representatives
are
not
biassed
in
their
plan
for
common
education
by
prejudice
or
hostility
toward
some
other
body
with
what
utter
disregard
for
the
rights
of
conscience
the
infidel
and
atheistic
faction
coolly
avows
its
purpose
to
enforce
a
secular
and
irreligious
education
upon
all
the
people
a
system
known
to
be
no
less
antagonistic
to
the

hostile
to
the
religious

of

what
loud
outcries
and
stormy
denunciations
echo
from
certain
popular
pulpits

this
faction
demands
the

is

in

looks
to

and
adheres
to

principle
of

regard
for

and

for

there

there
is

who
never

from
avowing
their
principles
and
whose
principles
are
always
right
in

of
temporary
unpopularity
the
representatives
of
the
catholic
church
of
america
when
the
excitement
of
the
hour
has
died
away
and
the
schemes
of
politicians
to
gain
power
by
fastening
upon
the
country
a
system
fatal
to
liberty
and
radical
in
its
assault
upon
the
spirit
of
our
government
have
met
their
just
fate
then
we
shall
receive
the
honor
due
to
those
who
have
defended
the
country
from
the
danger
of
adopting
partisan
measures
aimed
against
a
certain
class
of
citizens
we
hope
to
live
to
see
the
day
when
there
will
not
be
a
child
in
the
whole
land
capable
of
instruction
who
shall
not
receive
a
thorough
education
fitting
him
to
be
a
patriotic
citizen
of
our
country
and
at
the
same
time
in
nowise
interfering
with
his
religious
duties
the
present
system
signally
fails
to
accomplish
this
those
who
so
strenuously
uphold
its
organization
and
attempt
to
make
it
compulsory
upon
all
are
hostile
to
the
genius
of
our
institutions
and
fanatical
in
their
zeal
that
they
are
not
lovers
of
education
is
evident
from
their
own
ignorance
of
facts
that
they
are
in
earnest
when
they
charge
catholics
with
hostility
to
education
we
can
scarcely
believe
for
we
hear
from
the
same
lips
hints
and
warnings
against
catholic
success
in
education
we
hear
also
that
the
catholic
church
is
growing
and
unless
something
is
done
to
stop
her
she
will
convert
all
the
protestants
in
the
country
and
still
at
other
times
that
she
is
an
effete
and
thing
which
can
not
live
through
the
century
in
a
free
republic
at
one
time
catholics
are
derided
as
idiots
at
another
represented
as
deep
and
insidious
conspirators
there
is
scarcely
anything
which
is
not
affirmed
or
denied
of
them
according
as
it
suits
the
mood
of
their
revilers
if
our
people
were
cooler
and
more
dispassionate
we
should
find
all
those
calumnies
answering
one
another
as
it
is
we
are
constrained
to
pay
them
more
or
less
attention
though
the
nature
of
the
testimony
against
us
scarcely
allows
us
to
take
up
more
than
one
point
at
a
time
if
catholics
or
methodists
or
episcopalians
or
baptists
can
give
a
better
and
a
cheaper
education
we
see
no
reason
why
the
state
should
interfere
with
those
who
choose
to
avail
themselves
of
it

the

set
up

standard

how
or
where
they
shall

the

is

by

policy
to
promote
education
this
is
to
be
done
by
stimulating
in
this
department
the
same
activity
which
has
made
americans
famous
in
other
branches
of

by
encouraging

action
and
not
by

wolsey
fallen
from
the
summit
of
prosperity
continued
to
experience
a
succession
of
reverses
unceasingly
exposed
to
the
malice
of
his
enemies
he
struggled
in
vain
against
their
influence
and
if
they
failed
in
bringing
about
his
death
they
succeeded
at
least
in
poisoning
every
moment
of
his
existence
thus
at
the
time
even
when
henry
viii
had
sent
him
a
valuable
ring
as
a
token
of
amity
they
forced
the
king
to
despoil
the
wretched
man
of
the
valuable
possessions
which
they
pretended
to
wish
restored
to
him
he
received
one
day
from
his
master
a
new
assurance
of
his
royal
solicitude
the
next
his
resources
failing
he
was
obliged
for
want
of
money
to
dismiss
his
old
servants
and
remain
alone
in
his
exile
cromwell
with
an
incredible
adroitness
had
succeeded
by
degrees
in
disengaging
himself
from
the
obligations
he
owed
the
cardinal
and
in
making
the
downfall
and
misfortunes
of
his
master
serve
to
advance
his
own
interests
he
had
made
numerous
friends
among
the
throng
of
courtiers
surrounding
the
king
in
obtaining
from
the
unhappy
wolsey
his
recognition
of
the
distribution
which
the
king
had
made
of
his
effects
by
adding
the
sanction
of
his
own
seal
after
repeated
refusals
on
the
part
of
the
cardinal
he
was
at
last
successful
in
convincing
him
of
the
urgent
necessity
for
making
this
concession
in
order
to
try
he
said
with
apparent
sincerity
to
lessen
the
animosity
and
remove
the
prejudices
they
entertained
against
him
but
in
reality
the
intention
of
cromwell
had
been
by
that
manœuvre
to
strip
him
of
his
entire
possessions
for
the
courtiers
being
well
aware
their
titles
were
not
valid
under
the
law
were
every
moment
afraid
they
might
be
called
on
to
surrender
the
gifts
they
had
received
and
consequently
desired
nothing
so
much
as
to
have
the
cardinal
confirm
them
in
their
unjust
possessions
it
was
by
means
of
this
monstrous
ingratitude
that
cromwell
purchased
the
favor
of
the
court
began
to
elevate
himself
near
the
king
in
receiving
new
dignities
and
honors
and
at
length
found
himself
saved
from
the
fate
he
had
so
greatly
apprehended
at
the
moment
of
his
downfall
of
what
consequence
was
wolsey
to
him
now
banished
from
his
archbishopric
of
york
he
was
but
a
broken
footstool
which
cromwell
no
longer
cared
to
remember
he
scarcely
deigned
to
employ
his
new
friends
in
having
wolsey
reduced
to
the
condition
of
an
invalid
removed
from
the
miserable
abode
at
asher
to
the
better
situated
castle
of
richmond
and
later
when
the
heads
of
the
council
always
apprehensive
and
uneasy
because
of
his
existence
obtained
his
peremptory
exile
he
considered
this
departure
as
completely
liberating
him
from
every
obligation
to
his
old
benefactor
events
were
thus
following
each
other
in
rapid
succession
when
toward
the
middle
of
the
day
the
door
of
the
cabinet
opened
and
sir
thomas
more
in
the
grand
costume
of
lord
chancellor
entered
as
had
been
his
custom
the
king
turned
slightly
around
on
his
chair
and
fixed
upon
him
a
searching
glance
as
if
he
sought
to
read
the
inmost
soul
of
more
the
countenance
of
the
chancellor
was
tranquil
respectful
and
assured
such
as
it
had
always
been
in
vain
henry
sought
to
discover
the
indications
of
fear
the
impetuous
desires
and
ambitions
which
he
was
accustomed
to
excite
or
contradict
in
the
agitated
heart
of
wolsey
and
by
which
in
his
turn
master
of
his
favorite
of
his
future
and
of
his
great
talents
he
made
him
pay
so
dearly
for
the
honors
at
intervals
heaped
upon
him
nothing
of
all
this
could
he
discover
more
seated
himself
when
invited
by
the
king
and
entered
upon
the
discussion
of
a
multitude
of
affairs
to
which
he
had
been
devoting
himself
with
unremitting
attention
day
and
night
he
would
urge
measure
will
be
most
useful
to
your
kingdom
sire
justice
it
seems
to
me
requires
you
to
give
such
a
decision
in
that
never
were
any
other
considerations
brought
to
bear
nor
other
demands
made
nothing
for
himself
nothing
for
his
family
but
all
for
the
good
of
the
state
the
interests
of
the
people
silence
upon
all
subjects
his
conscience
did
not
oblige
him
to
reveal
though
the
king
perceived
only
too
clearly
the
inmost
depths
of
the
pure
and
elevated
soul
of
his
chancellor
by
dazzling
this
man
of
rare
virtues
with
a
fortune
to
which
a
simple
gentleman
could
never
aspire
henry
had
hoped
to
allure
him
to
his
own
party
and
induce
him
to
sustain
the
divorce
bill
thus
by
a
monstrous
contradiction
in
corrupting
him
by
avarice
and
ambition
he
would
have
destroyed
the
very
virtues
on
which
he
wished
to
lean
he
perceived
with
indignation
that
all
his
artifices
had
been
unsuccessful
in
influencing
a
will
accustomed
to
yield
only
to
convictions
of
duty
and
he
feared
his
ability
to
move
him
by
any
of
the
indirect
and
abstract
arguments
which
he
felt
and
acknowledged
to
himself
were
weak
and
insufficient
revolving
all
these
reflections
in
his
mind
the
king
eagerly
opened
the
conversation
with
more
but
in
a
quiet
tone
and
with
an
air
of
assumed
indifference
sir
thomas
he
said
you
reflected
on
what
i
asked
you
do
you
not
find
now
that
my
marriage
with
my
wife
was
in
opposition
to
all
laws
human
and
divine
and
that
i
can
not
do
otherwise
than
have
it
pronounced
null
and
void
after
being
thus
advised
by
so
many
learned
men
and
ecclesiastics
also
replied
more
have
done
what
your
majesty
requested
me
but
it
occurs
to
my
mind
that
in
an
affair
of
so
much
importance
it
will
not
be
sufficient
to
ask
simply
the
advice
of
those
immediately
around
you
for
it
might
be
feared
that
influenced
by
the
affection
they
bear
for
you
they
would
not
decide
as
impartially
as
your
majesty
would
desire
perhaps
also
some
of
them
might
be
afraid
of
offending
you
i
have
therefore
concluded
that
it
would
be
better
for
your
majesty
to
consult
advisers
who
are
entirely
removed
from
all
such
suspicions
that
is
why
i
have
endeavored
to
collect
together
in
this
manuscript
i
have
here
the
various
passages
of
holy
scripture
bearing
on
this
subject
i
have
added
also
the
opinions
of
augustine
and
several
other
fathers
of
the
church
with
whose
eminent
learning
and
high
authority
among
the
faithful
your
majesty
is
said
the
king
with
a
movement
of
impatience
was
right
leave
it
there
i
will
read
sir
thomas
deposited
the
manuscript
on
the
table
lord
chancellor
he
continued
house
of
commons
has
taken
some
steps
toward
discharging
my
debts
what
do
they
think
of
this
in
the
city
replied
more
must
tell
you
candidly
they
complain
openly
and
loudly
they
say
if
the
ministers
had
not
taken
care
to
introduce
into
the
house
members
who
had
received
their
positions
from
themselves
the
bill
would
never
have
passed
for
it
is
altogether
unjust
and
iniquitous
for
parliament
to
dispose
in
this
manner
of
private
property
they
say
still
farther
that
it
has
been
inserted
in
the
preamble
of
the
bill
that
the
prosperity
of
the
kingdom
under
the
paternal
administration
had
induced
them
to
testify
their
gratitude
by
discharging
his
debts
if
this
pretext
is
sincere
it
reflects
the
greatest
honor
on
cardinal
wolsey
and
if
on
the
contrary
it
is
false
it
covers
his
successors
with
exclaimed
the
king
they
dare
express
themselves
in
this
manner
replied
sir
thomas
i
will
frankly
say
to
the
king
that
it
would
have
been
far
better
to
have
imposed
a
new
tax
supported
equally
by
all
than
thus
to
despoil
individuals
of
their
are
never
contented
exclaimed
the
king
impatiently
have
sacrificed
wolsey
to
their
hatred
whom
there
is
no
person
in
the
kingdom
now
able
to
replace
this
gardiner
torments
me
with
questions
which
are
far
from
satisfactory
to
his
dull
comprehension
everything
goes
wrong
unless
i
take
the
trouble
of
managing
it
myself
while
with
the
cardinal
the
slightest
suggestion
was
sufficient
i
constantly
feel
inclined
to
recall
him
then
we
will
see
what
they
will
say
but
no
he
continued
with
an
expression
of
gloomy
sullenness
gave
me
no
rest
until
i
had
banished
him
from
his
archbishopric
of
york
it
was
they
said
the
sole
means
of
preventing
parliament
from
pronouncing
his
condemnation
by
this
time
he
is
doubtless
already
reconciled
he
is
so
vain
a
creature
that
the
three
or
four
words
i
have
said
in
his
favor
to
my
nobles
of
the
north
will
have
been
worth
more
to
him
than
the
homage
and
adulation
of
a
court
without
which
he
can
not
exist
he
is
pious
now
they
say
occupying
himself
only
with
good
works
and
in
doing
penance
for
his
many
sins
of
the
past
in
fact
he
is
entirely
reconciled
he
has
already
forgotten
all
that
i
have
done
for
him
i
shall
devote
myself
then
to
those
who
now
serve
me
doubt
very
much
if
your
majesty
has
been
correctly
informed
with
regard
to
the
latter
fact
replied
more
i
know
that
the
order
compelling
him
to
be
entirely
removed
from
your
presence
is
the
one
that
caused
him
the
deepest
more
interrupted
the
king
very
suddenly
as
if
to
take
him
by
surprise
are
opposed
to
my
divorce
i
have
known
it
perfectly
well
for
a
long
time
and
these
extracts
from
the
fathers
of
the
church
to
which
you
refer
me
are
simply
the
expression
of
your
own
opinions
which
you
wish
to
convey
to
me
in
this
indirect
replied
more
slightly
embarrassed
had
hoped
your
majesty
would
not
force
me
to
give
my
opinion
on
a
subject
of
such
grave
importance
and
one
as
i
have
already
explained
on
which
i
possess
neither
the
authority
nor
the
ability
to
well
sir
thomas
replied
the
king
in
a
confident
manner
wishing
to
discover
what
effect
his
words
would
produce
on
more
entirely
convinced
of
the
justice
of
my
cause
and
that
nothing
can
prevent
me
from
availing
myself
of
it
i
am
determined
if
the
pope
refuses
what
i
have
a
right
to
demand
to
withdraw
from
the
tyrannical
yoke
of
his
authority
i
will
appoint
a
patriarch
in
my
kingdom
and
the
bishops
shall
no
longer
submit
to
his
schism
exclaimed
more
schism
dismember
the
church
of
jesus
christ
for
a
woman
and
he
paused
appalled
at
what
henry
had
said
and
astonished
at
his
own
energetic
denunciation
the
king
felt
as
by
a
violent
shock
all
the
force
of
that
exclamation
and
dropping
his
head
on
his
breast
he
remained
stupefied
like
one
who
had
just
been
aroused
from
a
painful
and
terrible
dream
just
at
that
moment
the
cabinet
door
was
thrown
violently
open
and
lady
anne
boleyn
entered
precipitately
she
was
drowned
in
tears
and
carried
in
her
arms
a
hunting
spaniel
that
belonged
to
the
king
she
threw
it
into
the
centre
of
the
apartment
evidently
in
a
frightful
rage
she
cried
looking
at
the
king
is
your
wretched
dog
that
has
tried
to
strangle
my
favorite
bird
you
never
do
anything
but
try
to
annoy
me
make
me
miserable
and
cause
me
all
kinds
of
intolerable
vexations
i
have
told
you
already
that
i
did
not
want
that
horrid
animal
in
my
in
the
meantime
the
dog
which
she
had
thrown
on
the
floor
set
up
a
lamentable
howl
the
king
felt
deeply
humiliated
by
this
ridiculous
scene
and
especially
on
account
of
the
angry
familiarity
exhibited
by
anne
boleyn
in
presence
of
sir
thomas
more
for
she
either
forgot
herself
in
her
extreme
excitement
and
indignation
or
she
believed
her
empire
so
securely
established
that
she
did
not
hesitate
to
give
these
proofs
of
it
she
continued
her
complaints
and
reproaches
with
increasing
haughtiness
until
she
was
interrupted
by
stephen
gardiner
who
came
to
bring
some
despatches
to
the
king
henry
arose
immediately
and
motioning
sir
thomas
to
open
the
door
without
saying
a
word
he
took
anne
boleyn
by
the
hand
and
leading
her
from
the
room
ordered
her
to
retire
to
her
own
apartment
he
then
returned
and
seating
himself
near
the
chancellor
concealed
as
far
as
he
was
able
his
excitement
and
mortification
sir
thomas
still
more
excited
could
not
avoid
as
they
went
over
the
despatches
indignantly
reflecting
on
the
manner
in
which
anne
boleyn
had
treated
the
king
on
his
deplorable
infatuation
and
the
terrible
consequences
to
which
that
infatuation
must
inevitably
lead
the
king
divining
the
nature
of
his
reflections
experienced
a
degree
of
humiliation
that
made
him
inexpressibly
miserable
say
these
despatches
he
asked
endeavoring
to
assume
composure
does
more
think
of
me
he
said
to
himself
so
grave
so
pious
so
dignified
he
despises
me
that
silly
girl
give
an
account
of
the
reception
of
the
earl
of
wiltshire
answered
more
will
read
it
aloud
if
your
majesty
no
said
the
king
whom
the
name
of
wiltshire
confused
still
more
them
to
me
i
am
perfectly
familiar
with
the
he
did
not
intend
that
more
should
yet
be
apprised
of
the
base
intrigues
he
had
ordered
to
be
practised
at
rome
to
assist
the
father
of
his
mistress
in
obtaining
the
divorce
having
taken
the
letters
he
found
the
emperor
had
treated
his
ambassador
with
the
utmost
contempt
remarking
to
wiltshire
that
he
was
an
interested
party
since
he
was
father
of
the
rival
and
he
would
have
to
inform
henry
viii
that
the
emperor
was
not
a
merchant
to
sell
the
honor
of
his
aunt
for
three
hundred
thousand
crowns
even
if
he
proposed
to
abandon
her
cause
but
on
the
contrary
he
should
defend
it
to
the
last
extremity
and
after
saying
this
the
emperor
had
deliberately
turned
his
back
on
the
ambassador
and
forbidden
him
to
be
again
admitted
to
his
presence
henry
grew
red
and
white
alternately
am
then
the
of
europe
he
murmured
through
his
teeth
numerous
other
explanations
followed
in
which
the
earl
of
wiltshire
gave
an
exact
and
circumstantial
account
of
the
offer
he
had
made
to
the
holy
father
of
the
treatise
composed
by
cromwell
on
the
subject
of
the
divorce
saying
that
he
had
brought
the
author
with
him
who
was
prepared
to
sustain
the
opinions
advanced
against
all
opposition
he
ended
by
informing
the
king
that
in
spite
of
his
utmost
efforts
he
had
not
been
able
to
prevent
the
pope
from
according
the
emperor
a
brief
forbidding
henry
to
celebrate
another
marriage
before
the
case
had
been
entirely
decided
and
enjoining
him
to
treat
her
in
the
meantime
as
his
legitimate
wife
wiltshire
sent
with
his
letter
an
especial
copy
of
that
document
adding
that
he
feared
the
information
the
holy
father
had
received
of
the
violence
exercised
by
the
english
universities
toward
those
doctors
who
had
voted
against
the
divorce
together
with
the
money
and
promises
distributed
among
those
of
france
especially
the
university
of
paris
to
obtain
favorable
decisions
had
not
contributed
toward
influencing
him
the
king
read
and
several
times
all
these
statements
and
was
entirely
overwhelmed
with
indignation
and
disappointment
why
he
angrily
exclaimed
dashing
the
letter
as
far
as
possible
from
him
have
these
flatterers
surrounding
me
always
assured
me
i
would
succeed
in
my
undertaking
why
could
they
not
foresee
that
it
would
be
impossible
and
why
have
i
not
found
a
sincere
friend
who
might
have
admonished
me
more
he
cried
after
a
silence
i
am
most
miserable
what
could
be
more
unjust
i
am
devoted
to
lady
anne
boleyn
as
my
future
wife
and
now
they
wish
to
make
me
renounce
her
the
intrigues
prevail
and
against
all
laws
human
and
divine
they
condemn
me
to
eternal
celibacy
replied
sir
thomas
in
a
firm
but
sadly
respectful
manner
it
is
indeed
distressing
to
see
your
majesty
thus
voluntarily
destroy
your
own
peace
that
of
your
kingdom
the
happiness
of
your
subjects
the
regard
for
your
own
honor
so
many
benefits
in
fact
and
all
for
the
foolish
love
of
a
girl
who
possesses
neither
worth
nor
exclaimed
the
king
not
speak
of
her
in
this
manner
she
is
young
and
thoughtless
but
in
her
heart
she
is
devoted
to
is
replied
more
is
entirely
devoted
to
the
crown
she
loves
dearly
the
honors
of
royalty
and
her
pride
is
doubly
said
the
king
forgive
you
for
speaking
thus
to
me
your
severe
morals
your
austere
virtues
have
not
permitted
you
to
experience
the
torments
of
love
and
that
is
why
he
added
gloomily
can
not
comprehend
its
irresistible
impulses
and
true
that
is
known
to
one
man
is
unknown
to
another
replied
more
in
itself
is
a
sublime
sentiment
that
comes
from
god
but
alas
men
drag
it
in
the
dust
like
all
else
they
touch
and
too
often
mistake
the
appearance
for
the
reality
to
love
anyone
o
my
king
continued
more
it
not
to
prefer
them
in
all
things
above
yourself
to
consider
yourself
as
nothing
and
be
willing
to
sacrifice
without
regret
all
that
you
would
wish
to
possess
said
henry
viii
that
is
the
way
i
love
anne
more
than
my
life
more
than
the
entire
world
no
sire
exclaimed
more
tell
me
that
no
say
you
love
her
say
you
love
the
pleasure
she
affords
you
the
attractions
she
possesses
which
have
charmed
your
senses
in
a
word
acknowledge
that
you
love
yourself
in
her
and
consider
well
that
the
day
when
nature
deprives
her
of
her
gifts
and
graces
your
memory
will
no
longer
represent
her
to
you
but
as
an
insipid
image
worthy
only
of
a
scornful
oblivion
ah
if
you
loved
her
truly
you
would
act
in
a
different
manner
you
would
never
have
considered
aught
but
her
happiness
and
her
interests
you
would
blush
for
her
and
you
would
not
be
able
to
endure
the
thought
of
the
shame
with
which
you
have
not
hesitated
to
cover
her
yourself
in
the
eyes
of
all
your
court
replied
henry
in
a
low
and
altered
voice
she
she
loves
me
i
can
not
doubt
loves
the
king
of
england
replied
more
excitedly
not
henry
she
loves
the
mighty
prince
who
ignominiously
bends
his
neck
beneath
the
yoke
which
she
pleases
to
impose
on
him
but
poor
and
destitute
her
glance
would
never
have
fallen
upon
you
proud
of
her
beauty
vain
of
her
charms
she
holds
you
like
a
conquered
vassal
whom
she
governs
by
a
gesture
or
a
word
she
loves
riches
honors
and
the
pleasures
with
which
you
surround
her
she
is
dazzled
by
the
of
the
high
rank
you
occupy
and
to
attain
it
she
fears
not
to
purchase
it
at
the
price
of
your
soul
and
all
that
you
possess
what
matters
to
her
the
care
of
your
honor
or
the
love
of
your
subjects
has
she
ever
said
to
you
i
love
you
but
your
duty
separates
you
from
me
be
great
be
has
she
said
your
wife
is
my
sovereign
and
i
recognize
no
do
you
not
hear
the
voice
of
your
people
saying
to
your
children
shall
reign
over
but
what
am
i
saying
no
of
course
she
has
not
spoken
thus
because
she
seeks
to
elevate
herself
she
thinks
of
her
own
aggrandizement
to
see
at
her
feet
men
whom
she
would
never
otherwise
be
able
to
shall
i
do
then
what
shall
i
do
cried
henry
dolorously
anne
boleyn
replied
thomas
more
coolly
should
do
it
since
you
have
broken
off
her
marriage
with
the
earl
of
northumberland
if
not
send
her
away
from
will
do
it
no
i
will
not
do
it
he
exclaimed
almost
in
the
same
breath
shall
never
be
able
to
do
is
to
say
you
never
intend
to
do
it
replied
more
can
always
accomplish
what
we
no
replied
henry
can
not
always
do
what
we
wish
everything
conspires
against
me
tired
of
willing
i
can
make
nothing
bend
to
my
will
of
what
use
is
my
royal
power
to
be
happy
is
a
thing
impossible
of
all
things
in
this
life
most
impossible
answered
more
he
who
aspires
to
attain
it
finds
his
miseries
redoubled
at
the
very
moment
he
thinks
they
will
terminate
the
possession
of
unlawful
pleasures
is
poisoned
by
the
remorse
that
follows
in
their
train
and
frightened
by
their
insecurity
and
short
duration
we
are
prevented
from
enjoying
them
in
quietness
and
cried
henry
stamping
his
foot
violently
on
the
floor
had
better
be
replied
thomas
more
perhaps
we
may
be
repeated
the
king
as
if
struck
with
terror
no
more
not
i
would
not
be
willing
now
to
appear
in
the
presence
of
replied
more
can
you
expect
to
live
peaceably
in
a
condition
in
which
you
are
afraid
to
die
in
a
few
hours
or
at
least
in
a
few
years
that
is
as
certain
as
the
light
of
day
which
shines
this
moment
your
life
and
mine
will
have
to
end
leaving
nothing
more
than
regrets
for
the
past
and
fears
for
the
say
truly
more
replied
the
king
life
appears
so
long
to
us
the
future
so
far
removed
is
it
necessary
then
that
we
be
always
thinking
of
it
and
sacrificing
our
pleasures
later
well
we
will
change
will
we
not
have
more
time
then
to
think
of
it
replied
more
sadly
remains
very
little
time
to
him
who
is
always
putting
off
until
as
he
heard
the
last
words
the
face
grew
instantly
crimson
he
kept
more
with
him
entertaining
him
with
his
trials
and
vexations
and
the
night
was
far
advanced
before
he
permitted
him
to
retire
during
four
entire
days
the
king
remained
shut
up
in
his
apartment
and
anne
boleyn
vainly
attempted
to
gain
admittance
meanwhile
a
rumor
of
her
downfall
spread
rapidly
through
the
palace
the
courtiers
who
were
accustomed
to
attend
her
in
greater
numbers
and
much
more
scrupulously
than
those
of
queen
catherine
suddenly
discontinued
and
on
the
last
occasion
scarcely
one
of
them
made
his
appearance
they
also
took
great
care
to
preserve
a
frigid
reserve
and
doubtful
politeness
which
excited
to
the
last
degree
her
alarm
and
that
of
her
ambitious
family
the
latter
were
every
moment
in
dread
of
the
blow
that
seemed
ready
to
fall
upon
them
in
this
state
of
gloomy
disquiet
every
circumstance
was
anxiously
noted
and
served
to
excite
their
apprehensions
they
continually
discussed
among
themselves
the
arrival
of
the
despatches
from
rome
the
nature
of
which
they
suspected
from
the
very
long
time
sir
thomas
more
had
remained
with
the
king
then
they
refreshed
their
memories
with
reflections
on
the
inflexible
severity
of
the
lord
chancellor
his
old
attachment
for
queen
catherine
an
attachment
which
the
elevation
of
more
had
never
interrupted
as
they
had
hoped
would
be
the
case
finally
the
sincerity
of
his
nature
and
the
estimation
in
which
he
was
held
by
the
king
made
them
with
great
reason
apprehend
the
influence
of
his
counsel
already
they
found
themselves
abandoned
by
almost
all
of
those
upon
whose
support
they
had
relied
suffolk
leagued
with
them
heretofore
in
order
to
secure
the
downfall
of
cardinal
wolsey
now
regarded
them
in
their
disgrace
as
of
little
consequence
to
one
so
closely
related
as
himself
to
his
majesty
by
the
princess
his
wife
the
duke
of
norfolk
justly
proud
of
his
birth
his
wealth
and
his
reputation
could
not
believe
the
power
with
which
the
influence
of
his
niece
had
clothed
him
in
the
council
by
any
means
bound
him
to
engage
in
or
compromise
himself
in
her
cause
in
the
meantime
they
realized
that
they
would
inevitably
be
compelled
to
succumb
or
make
a
last
and
desperate
effort
and
they
resolved
with
one
accord
to
address
themselves
to
cromwell
whose
shrewdness
and
cunning
joined
to
the
motives
of
that
could
be
brought
to
bear
on
him
seemed
to
offer
them
a
last
resort
cromwell
immediately
understood
all
the
benefit
he
would
be
likely
to
derive
from
the
situation
whether
he
succeeded
or
failed
in
the
cause
of
anne
boleyn
and
determined
according
to
his
own
expression
to
or
he
wrote
to
the
king
demanding
an
audience
fully
realized
he
wrote
with
his
characteristic
adroitness
entire
incapacity
for
giving
advice
but
neither
his
devoted
affection
nor
his
sense
of
duty
would
permit
him
to
remain
silent
when
he
knew
the
anxiety
his
sovereign
was
suffering
it
might
be
deemed
presumptuous
in
him
to
say
it
but
he
believed
all
the
difficulties
embarrassing
the
king
arose
from
the
timidity
of
his
advisers
who
were
misled
by
exterior
appearances
or
deceived
by
the
opinions
of
the
the
king
immediately
granted
him
an
audience
although
his
usual
custom
was
to
remain
entirely
secluded
and
alone
while
laboring
under
these
violent
transports
of
passion
he
hoped
that
cromwell
might
be
able
to
present
his
opinions
with
such
ability
as
would
at
least
be
sufficient
to
divert
him
from
the
wretchedness
he
experienced
cromwell
appeared
before
him
with
eyes
cast
down
and
affecting
an
air
of
sadness
and
constraint
he
said
as
he
approached
the
king
even
yesterday
i
was
happy
yes
happy
in
the
thought
of
being
permitted
to
present
myself
before
your
majesty
because
it
seemed
to
me
i
might
be
able
to
offer
some
consolation
for
the
anxieties
you
experience
by
reminding
you
that
nothing
should
induce
you
to
pause
in
your
efforts
to
advance
the
interests
of
the
kingdom
and
the
state
but
in
appearing
before
you
i
know
not
what
to
say
this
morning
lady
boleyn
being
informed
that
i
was
to
have
the
happiness
of
seeing
your
majesty
sent
for
me
and
charged
me
with
the
commission
of
asking
your
permission
for
her
to
withdraw
from
exclaimed
henry
rising
hastily
to
his
feet
wishes
to
leave
me
she
my
only
happiness
my
only
joy
never
have
found
her
continued
cromwell
seeming
not
to
remark
the
painful
uneasiness
he
had
aroused
in
the
mind
have
found
her
plunged
in
a
state
of
indescribable
grief
she
was
almost
deprived
of
consciousness
her
beautiful
eyes
were
weighed
down
with
tears
her
long
hair
hanging
neglected
around
her
shoulders
and
her
pale
transparent
cheek
made
her
resemble
a
delicate
white
rose
bowed
on
its
slender
stem
before
the
violence
of
the
tempest
my
dear
cromwell
she
said
to
me
with
a
tremulous
voice
but
sweet
as
the
soft
expiring
notes
of
an
æolian
lyre
say
to
my
king
to
my
lord
i
ask
his
permission
to
retire
this
day
to
my
i
know
that
i
am
surrounded
by
enemies
but
while
favored
by
his
protection
i
have
not
feared
their
malice
but
now
i
feel
and
can
not
doubt
it
i
shall
become
their
victim
since
they
have
succeeded
in
prejudicing
my
sovereign
against
me
to
such
an
extent
that
he
refuses
to
hear
my
can
she
be
afraid
of
here
cried
the
king
would
dare
offend
her
in
my
palace
will
be
able
to
defend
her
if
your
majesty
abandons
her
replied
cromwell
in
a
haughty
tone
feigning
to
forget
the
humble
demeanor
he
had
assumed
and
mentally
applauding
the
success
of
his
stratagem
she
not
given
up
all
for
you
every
day
she
has
wounded
by
her
refusals
the
greatest
lords
of
the
realm
who
have
earnestly
sued
for
her
heart
and
hand
but
she
has
constantly
refused
to
listen
to
them
because
of
the
love
she
bears
for
you
always
preferring
the
uncertain
hope
of
one
day
becoming
yours
to
all
the
brilliant
advantages
of
the
wealthiest
suitors
she
has
been
urged
to
accept
but
when
her
honor
is
attacked
when
you
banish
her
from
your
presence
she
feels
she
will
not
have
the
courage
to
endure
near
you
such
wretchedness
and
she
asks
to
be
permitted
to
withdraw
from
court
at
once
and
for
ever
ever
repeated
the
king
has
she
said
that
have
you
heard
her
right
no
cromwell
you
are
mistaken
i
know
her
better
than
and
he
turned
on
cromwell
a
keen
scrutinizing
glance
but
nothing
could
daunt
this
audacious
man
said
all
i
have
told
you
replied
the
hypocrite
with
the
coolest
assurance
raising
his
head
haughtily
i
dare
to
repeat
what
i
have
not
heard
and
your
majesty
can
imagine
that
my
devotion
has
alone
induced
me
to
become
the
bearer
of
so
painful
a
message
for
i
could
not
believe
your
majesty
had
ceased
to
love
cried
the
king
have
i
for
one
moment
ceased
to
adore
her
but
listen
dear
cromwell
and
be
convinced
of
how
wretched
i
am
yesterday
i
received
from
rome
the
most
distressing
intelligence
i
had
written
the
pope
a
letter
signed
by
a
great
number
of
lords
of
my
court
and
bishops
of
the
kingdom
in
which
they
expressed
the
fears
they
entertained
of
one
day
seeing
the
flames
of
civil
war
break
out
in
this
country
if
i
should
die
without
male
heirs
as
there
would
be
grounds
for
contesting
the
right
of
my
daughter
mary
to
the
throne
on
the
score
of
her
legitimacy
but
nothing
can
move
here
the
king
rose
furiously
indignant
has
answered
this
petition
he
cried
walking
with
hurried
strides
up
and
down
the
floor
how
by
my
faith
i
can
scarcely
repeat
that
he
pardons
the
terms
they
have
used
in
their
letter
attributing
them
to
the
affection
they
bear
for
me
that
he
is
under
still
greater
obligations
to
me
than
they
have
mentioned
that
it
is
not
his
fault
if
the
affair
of
the
divorce
remains
undecided
that
he
has
sent
legates
to
england
that
the
queen
has
refused
to
recognize
them
and
appealed
from
all
they
have
done
that
he
has
tried
vainly
in
every
possible
way
to
terminate
the
affair
amicably
and
furthermore
will
perhaps
be
ready
to
say
he
writes
being
under
so
many
obligations
to
the
king
as
i
am
i
should
waive
all
other
considerations
and
accord
him
absolutely
everything
he
although
that
would
be
sovereignly
unjust
yet
he
can
conclude
nothing
else
from
their
letter
that
they
reflect
not
on
the
queen
having
represented
to
him
that
all
christendom
is
scandalized
because
they
would
attempt
to
annul
a
marriage
contracted
so
many
years
ago
at
the
request
of
two
great
kings
and
under
a
dispensation
from
the
pope
a
marriage
confirmed
by
the
birth
of
several
children
and
what
else
let
me
see
that
if
i
rely
on
the
opinion
of
several
doctors
and
universities
he
refers
on
his
part
to
the
law
of
god
upon
the
sanctity
and
unity
of
marriage
and
the
highest
authorities
taken
from
the
hebrew
and
latin
writers
that
the
decisions
of
the
universities
which
i
bring
forward
are
supported
by
no
proofs
he
can
not
decide
finally
upon
that
and
if
he
should
precipitate
his
judgment
they
would
no
longer
be
able
to
avert
the
evils
with
which
it
is
said
england
is
threatened
that
he
desires
as
much
as
they
that
i
may
have
male
heirs
but
he
is
not
god
to
give
them
to
me
he
has
no
greater
wish
than
to
please
me
as
far
as
lies
in
his
power
without
at
the
same
time
violating
all
the
laws
of
justice
and
equity
and
finally
he
conjures
them
to
cease
demanding
of
him
things
that
are
opposed
to
his
conscience
in
order
that
he
may
be
spared
the
pain
of
refusing
mark
that
well
cromwell
the
pain
of
refusing
thus
you
see
after
having
tried
everything
spent
everything
and
used
every
possible
means
what
remains
now
for
me
to
hope
that
you
wish
replied
cromwell
without
exception
why
permit
yourself
to
be
governed
by
those
who
ought
to
be
your
slaves
among
all
the
clergy
who
surround
you
and
whom
you
are
able
to
reduce
if
you
choose
to
mendicity
can
you
not
find
a
priest
who
will
marry
you
if
i
were
king
of
england
i
would
very
soon
convince
them
that
the
happiness
of
lives
depended
entirely
upon
threaten
to
withdraw
from
the
authority
of
rome
and
you
will
very
soon
see
them
yielding
on
their
knees
to
all
your
said
henry
admire
your
spirit
and
the
boldness
of
the
measures
you
advocate
from
this
moment
i
open
to
you
the
door
of
my
council
remember
the
kindness
and
the
signal
favor
with
which
i
have
honored
you
however
your
inexperienced
zeal
carries
you
too
far
you
forget
that
the
day
i
would
determine
really
to
separate
myself
from
the
church
of
rome
i
would
become
schismatic
and
the
people
would
refuse
to
obey
me
moreover
i
am
a
catholic
and
i
wish
to
die
of
that
replied
cromwell
i
not
also
a
catholic
because
your
majesty
frightens
the
pope
will
he
cease
to
exist
declare
to
him
that
from
this
day
you
no
longer
recognize
his
authority
that
you
forbid
the
clergy
paying
their
tithes
to
or
receiving
from
him
their
nominations
you
will
see
then
if
the
next
day
your
present
marriage
is
not
annulled
and
the
one
you
wish
to
contract
approved
and
you
really
believe
it
said
the
king
am
sure
of
it
replied
cromwell
said
the
king
is
a
thing
utterly
impossible
the
bishops
would
refuse
to
accede
to
any
such
requirements
and
they
would
be
right
they
know
too
well
that
it
is
essential
for
the
church
to
have
a
head
in
order
to
maintain
her
unity
and
without
it
nothing
would
follow
but
confusion
and
who
can
prevent
your
majesty
from
becoming
yourself
that
head
exclaimed
cromwell
england
not
actually
a
monster
now
with
two
heads
one
of
them
wanting
a
thing
and
the
other
not
follow
the
example
given
you
by
those
german
princes
who
are
freeing
themselves
from
the
yoke
which
has
humbled
them
for
so
many
years
before
the
throne
of
a
pontiff
who
is
a
stranger
alike
to
their
affections
and
their
interests
then
everything
anomalous
will
rectify
itself
and
your
subjects
cease
to
believe
that
any
other
than
yourself
is
entitled
to
their
homage
or
are
right
little
cromwell
cried
henry
this
seductive
and
perfidious
discourse
flattering
at
the
same
time
his
guilty
passion
and
the
ambition
that
divided
his
soul
how
would
you
proceed
about
executing
this
marvellous
project
of
which
a
thought
had
already
crossed
my
own
mind
for
as
i
have
just
told
you
the
clergy
will
refuse
to
obey
me
and
i
shall
then
have
no
means
of
compelling
consideration
and
kindness
make
you
forget
replied
cromwell
adroitly
afraid
of
wounding
the
pride
statutes
of
præmunire
offer
you
means
both
sure
and
easy
is
it
not
by
those
laws
they
have
tried
wolsey
before
the
parliament
in
condemning
him
they
have
condemned
themselves
and
have
made
themselves
amenable
to
the
same
penalties
you
have
them
all
in
your
power
threaten
to
punish
them
in
their
turn
if
they
refuse
to
take
the
oath
acknowledging
you
as
head
of
the
church
and
do
it
fearlessly
if
they
dare
attempt
to
resist
little
cromwell
said
henry
slapping
him
familiarly
on
the
shoulder
observe
with
great
satisfaction
your
coolness
and
the
variety
of
resources
you
have
at
command
you
see
everything
at
a
glance
and
fear
nothing
i
have
made
all
these
objections
only
to
hear
how
you
would
meet
them
here
take
these
roman
documents
read
them
for
yourself
and
you
will
be
better
able
to
appreciate
their
contents
while
i
go
and
beg
anne
to
forget
the
wrongs
i
so
cruelly
reproach
myself
with
having
inflicted
on
saying
this
henry
viii
went
out
and
cromwell
followed
him
with
his
eyes
as
he
walked
through
the
long
gallery
an
ironical
smile
hovered
over
his
thin
and
bloodless
lips
as
he
watched
him
go
he
murmured
to
himself
yourself
at
the
feet
of
your
silly
mistress
and
ask
her
pardon
for
wishing
her
to
be
queen
of
england
they
are
grand
very
grand
these
kings
and
yet
they
find
themselves
very
often
held
in
the
hollow
of
the
hand
of
some
low
and
crafty
flatterer
creature
they
will
say
yes
i
am
despicable
in
the
eyes
of
many
and
yet
they
prepare
by
my
advice
to
overthrow
the
pillars
of
the
church
in
order
to
enrich
me
with
its
consecrated
he
laughed
a
diabolical
laugh
then
suddenly
his
face
grew
dark
and
a
fierce
malignant
gleam
shot
from
his
eyes
he
continued
prince
as
false
as
you
are
wicked
i
at
least
am
your
equal
in
cunning
and
duplicity
you
were
not
created
for
good
and
the
odious
voice
of
more
will
call
you
in
vain
to
the
path
of
virtue
my
tongue
ay
mine
is
to
you
far
sweeter
it
carries
a
poison
that
you
will
suck
with
eager
lips
the
son
of
the
poor
fuller
will
make
you
his
partner
in
crime
he
will
recline
with
you
on
your
velvet
throne
and
perfidious
cruelty
will
unite
us
heart
and
soul
go
seek
that
fool
whom
you
adore
and
who
will
weary
you
very
soon
and
the
vile
ambitious
father
who
has
begotten
her
but
for
me
destroy
your
kingdom
profane
the
sanctuary
light
the
funeral
pyre
and
compel
all
those
to
mount
it
who
shall
oppose
the
laws
cromwell
will
dictate
to
you
two
ferocious
beasts
share
the
throne
of
england
you
will
surfeit
me
with
gold
and
i
will
make
you
drunk
with
blood
you
shall
proclaim
aloud
what
i
shall
have
whispered
in
your
ear
ha
who
of
the
two
will
be
really
king
henry
viii
or
cromwell
why
cromwell
without
doubt
because
he
was
born
in
the
mire
he
has
learned
how
to
fly
while
the
other
was
being
fledged
beneath
the
shadow
of
the
crown
you
have
been
reared
within
these
walls
of
gold
continued
cromwell
surveying
the
magnificent
adornings
of
the
royal
chamber
exquisite
perfumes
escaping
from
fountains
and
flowers
have
always
surround
you
you
have
never
known
like
me
abandonment
and
want
suffered
from
cold
and
hunger
in
a
thatched
cottage
and
imbibed
the
hatred
fostered
in
those
abodes
of
wretchedness
against
the
rich
but
i
have
cherished
that
rage
in
my
inmost
soul
there
it
burns
like
a
consuming
fire
i
will
have
a
palace
i
will
have
power
and
be
feared
servile
courtiers
shall
fawn
at
my
feet
adulation
shall
surround
me
i
would
grasp
the
entire
world
and
yet
the
cry
of
my
soul
would
be
more
still
more
saying
this
cromwell
threw
himself
into
the
and
pushing
contemptuously
from
him
the
papers
he
had
taken
to
read
abandoned
himself
entirely
to
the
furious
thirst
of
avarice
and
ambition
that
devoured
him
the
curfew
had
already
sounded
many
hours
and
profound
silence
reigned
over
the
city
not
a
sound
was
heard
throughout
the
dark
and
winding
streets
save
the
boisterous
shouts
of
some
midnight
revellers
returning
from
a
party
of
pleasure
or
the
dreary
and
monotonous
song
of
a
besotted
inebriate
as
he
staggered
toward
his
home
in
the
mansion
of
the
french
ambassador
however
no
one
had
retired
and
young
de
vaux
impatiently
waiting
the
return
of
du
bellay
paced
with
measured
tread
up
and
down
the
large
hall
where
for
many
hours
supper
had
been
served
weary
with
listening
for
the
sound
of
footsteps
and
hearing
only
the
mournful
sighing
of
the
he
at
length
seated
himself
before
the
fire
in
a
great
tapestried
whose
back
rising
high
above
his
head
turned
over
in
the
form
of
a
canopy
and
gave
him
the
appearance
of
a
saint
reposing
in
the
depths
of
his
shrine
for
a
long
time
he
watched
the
sparks
as
they
flew
upward
from
the
fire
then
taking
a
book
from
his
pocket
he
opened
it
at
random
but
before
reaching
the
bottom
of
the
first
page
his
eyes
closed
the
book
fell
from
his
hands
and
he
sank
into
a
profound
sleep
from
which
he
was
aroused
only
by
the
noise
made
by
the
servants
on
the
arrival
of
their
master
de
vaux
being
suddenly
aroused
from
sleep
arose
hastily
to
his
feet
on
seeing
the
ambassador
enter
have
waited
for
you
with
the
greatest
impatience
he
exclaimed
with
a
suppressed
yawn
rather
you
have
been
sleeping
soundly
in
your
chair
replied
du
bellay
smiling
he
continued
turning
toward
the
valets
who
followed
him
my
cloak
and
hat
and
then
leave
us
you
can
remove
the
table
in
the
obedient
to
their
orders
they
lighted
several
more
lamps
and
retired
not
without
regret
however
at
losing
the
opportunity
of
catching
during
the
repast
a
word
that
might
have
satisfied
their
curiosity
as
to
the
cause
of
du
bellay
having
remained
at
the
palace
until
so
late
an
hour
monsieur
what
has
been
done
at
last
eagerly
inquired
young
de
vaux
as
soon
as
they
had
left
truth
i
can
not
yet
comprehend
it
myself
replied
du
bellay
spite
of
all
my
efforts
it
has
been
impossible
to
clearly
unravel
the
knot
of
intrigue
this
morning
as
you
know
nothing
was
talked
of
but
the
downfall
of
anne
boleyn
i
was
delighted
her
overthrow
would
have
dispensed
us
from
all
obligations
now
the
king
is
a
greater
fool
about
her
than
ever
and
unless
god
himself
strikes
a
blow
to
sever
them
i
believe
nothing
will
cure
him
of
his
infatuation
as
i
entered
his
first
word
was
to
demand
why
i
had
been
so
long
in
presenting
myself
i
replied
have
come
with
the
utmost
haste
i
assure
you
and
am
here
ready
to
execute
any
orders
it
may
please
you
to
give
he
then
said
to
me
have
several
things
to
tell
you
but
the
first
of
all
is
to
warn
you
of
my
determination
to
arrest
cardinal
wolsey
i
am
aware
that
you
have
manifested
a
great
deal
of
interest
in
him
that
you
have
even
gone
to
see
him
when
he
was
sick
but
that
is
of
no
consequence
i
am
far
from
believing
that
you
are
in
any
manner
concerned
in
the
treason
he
has
meditated
against
me
therefore
i
have
wished
to
advise
you
that
you
may
feel
no
apprehension
on
that
i
was
struck
with
astonishment
sire
i
at
last
answered
cardinal
betray
you
why
he
is
virtually
banished
from
england
where
he
occupies
himself
they
say
only
in
doing
works
of
charity
and
know
what
i
say
to
you
replied
the
king
own
servants
accuse
him
of
conspiring
against
the
state
but
i
shall
myself
examine
into
the
depths
of
this
accusation
in
the
meantime
he
shall
be
removed
to
the
tower
and
i
will
send
sir
walsh
with
instructions
to
join
the
earl
of
northumberland
in
order
to
arrest
wolsey
at
cawood
castle
where
he
is
now
it
possible
cried
de
vaux
interrupting
du
bellay
unfortunate
cardinal
who
could
have
brought
down
this
new
storm
on
his
head
du
bellay
do
you
believe
him
capable
of
committing
this
crime
even
if
it
were
in
his
power
do
not
believe
a
word
of
it
replied
du
bellay
i
know
not
who
has
excited
this
new
storm
of
persecution
i
have
tried
every
possible
means
to
ascertain
from
the
king
but
he
constantly
evaded
my
questions
by
answering
in
a
vague
and
obscure
manner
i
have
been
informed
in
the
palace
that
he
had
seen
no
person
during
the
day
except
cromwell
lady
boleyn
and
the
duke
of
suffolk
might
this
not
be
the
result
of
a
plot
concocted
between
them
this
is
only
a
conjecture
and
we
may
never
get
at
the
bottom
of
the
affair
but
let
us
pass
on
to
matters
of
more
importance
the
mistress
is
in
high
favor
again
the
king
is
determined
to
marry
her
and
has
proclaimed
in
a
threatening
manner
that
he
will
separate
himself
from
the
communion
of
rome
and
no
more
permit
the
supremacy
of
the
sovereign
pontiff
to
be
recognized
in
his
kingdom
he
demands
that
the
king
of
france
shall
do
the
same
and
rely
on
his
authority
in
following
his
cried
de
vaux
astounded
by
this
intelligence
how
have
you
answered
him
my
lord
said
all
that
i
felt
authorized
or
could
say
replied
du
bellay
what
means
shall
we
use
to
persuade
a
man
so
far
transported
and
subjugated
by
his
passions
that
he
seems
to
be
a
fool
no
longer
capable
of
reasoning
of
comprehending
either
his
duty
the
laws
or
the
future
i
have
held
up
to
him
the
disruption
of
his
kingdom
the
horrors
that
give
birth
to
a
war
of
religion
the
blood
that
it
would
cause
him
to
shall
spill
as
much
of
it
as
may
be
necessary
he
replied
make
them
yield
they
will
have
their
choice
already
the
representatives
of
the
clergy
have
been
ordered
to
assemble
well
they
shall
decide
among
themselves
which
is
preferable
death
exile
or
obedience
to
my
saying
this
continued
du
bellay
with
a
gloomy
expression
played
with
a
bunch
of
roses
carelessly
plucking
off
the
leaves
with
his
what
has
been
able
to
bring
the
king
in
so
short
a
time
to
such
an
extremity
asked
de
vaux
whose
eyes
full
of
astonishment
and
anxiety
interrogated
those
of
du
bellay
base
passions
without
doubt
and
still
more
the
vile
flattery
coming
from
some
one
of
those
he
has
taken
into
favor
replied
du
bellay
tried
in
vain
to
discover
who
the
could
be
but
the
king
was
never
for
a
moment
thrown
off
his
guard
he
constantly
repeated
have
resolved
on
this
will
do
that
i
shall
find
out
however
hereafter
continued
du
bellay
at
present
i
am
in
he
said
anything
to
you
about
the
grand
master
asked
de
vaux
but
it
seems
he
has
been
very
much
exercised
on
account
of
the
cordial
reception
chancellor
duprat
gave
campeggio
when
he
passed
through
france
man
has
behaved
very
badly
toward
me
he
said
sharply
was
so
lenient
as
to
let
him
leave
my
kingdom
unmolested
after
having
hesitated
a
long
time
whether
i
should
not
punish
him
severely
for
his
conduct
and
behold
one
of
your
ministers
receives
and
treats
him
with
the
utmost
magnificence
assured
him
no
consequence
should
be
attached
to
that
circumstance
and
pretended
that
chancellor
duprat
was
so
fond
of
good
cheer
and
grand
display
he
had
doubtless
been
too
happy
to
have
an
opportunity
of
parading
his
wealth
and
luxury
before
the
eyes
of
a
stranger
then
renewed
the
attack
against
wolsey
that
be
the
case
he
exclaimed
must
be
a
malady
common
to
all
these
chancellors
for
my
lord
cardinal
was
also
preparing
to
give
a
royal
reception
in
the
capital
of
his
realm
of
york
but
unfortunately
he
added
with
an
ironical
sneer
happen
to
be
his
master
and
we
have
somewhat
interfered
with
his
he
then
attacked
the
pope
then
our
king
and
finally
while
the
hour
of
midnight
was
striking
exhausted
with
anger
and
excitement
to
my
great
relief
he
permitted
me
to
retire
now
added
du
bellay
will
have
to
spend
the
rest
of
the
night
in
writing
and
the

the

was
most
violent
in

where
everything
was
in

for
a
general
outburst
most
of

were
compelled
to

secret

violent

kept
all
germany
in
a
state
of
agitation
occasional
outbreaks
among
the

followed
by
pillage
and
incendiarism
increased
the
general
confusion
it
was
during
this
time
of
wild
excitement
that
the
elections
for
the
imperial
parliament
were
held
to
this
assembly
many
avowed
atheists
pantheists
communists
and
jacobins
were
chosen
men
who
fully
agreed
with

when
he
declared
that
were
six
plagues
in
germany
the
princes
the
nobles
the
bureaucrats
the
capitalists
the
parsons
and
the

on

sat
the

the

of
the

of
the
of
the

the

was
occupied
by
functionaries
and
bureaucrats
chiefly
from
prussia
the
parliament
of
frankfort
in
the
or
which
it
proclaimed
decreed
universal
suffrage
abolished
all
the
political
rights
of
the
aristocracy
the
hereditary
chambers
in
all
the
states
of
germany
set
aside
the
existing
family
entails
and
though
nominally
it
retained
the
imperial
power
degraded
the
emperor
to
a
republican
president
by
giving
him
merely
a
suspensive
veto
while
this
parliament
was
sitting
the
catholic
bishops
of
germany
assembled
in
council
at
würzburg
and
at
the
conclusion
of
their
deliberations
drew
up
a
memorial
as
firm
in
tone
as
it
was
clear
and
precise
in
expression
in
which
they
set
forth
the
claims
of
the
church
bring
about
they
said
separation
from
the
state
that
is
to
say
from
public
order
which
necessarily
reposes
on
a
moral
and
religious
foundation
is
not
according
to
the
will
of
the
church
if
the
state
will
perforce
separate
from
the
church
so
will
the
church
without
approving
tolerate
what
it
can
not
avoid
and
when
not
compelled
by
the
duty
of
she
will
not
break
the
bonds
of
union
made
fast
by
mutual
understanding
church
entrusted
with
the
solemn
and
holy
mission
my
father
hath
sent
me
so
send
i
ye
requires
for
the
accomplishment
of
this
mission
whatever
the
form
of
government
of
the
state
may
be
the
fullest
freedom
and
independence
her
holy
popes
prelates
and
confessors
have
in
all
ages
willingly
and
courageously
given
up
their
life
and
blood
for
the
preservation
of
this
inalienable
in
virtue
of
these
principles
the
bishops
in
this
memorial
claimed
the
right
of
directing
without
any
interference
on
the
part
of
the
state
theological
seminaries
and
of
founding
schools
colleges
and
all
kinds
of
educational
establishments
of
exerting
canonical
control
unfettered
by
state
meddling
over
the
conduct
of
their
clergy
as
well
as
that
of
introducing
into
their
dioceses
religious
orders
congregations
and
pious
confraternities
for
which
they
demanded
the
same
rights
which
the
new
political
constitution
had
granted
to
secular
associations
finally
they
asserted
their
right
to
free
and
untrammelled
communication
with
the
holy
see
and
as
included
in
this
that
of
receiving
and
publishing
all
papal
bulls
briefs
and
other
documents
without
the
royal
placet
which
they
declared
to
be
repugnant
to
the
honor
and
dignity
of
the
ministers
of
religion
the
frankfort
parliament
decreed
the
total
separation
of
church
and
state
and
was
therefore
compelled
to
guarantee
the
freedom
of
all
religions
this
separation
was
sanctioned
by
the
catholic
members
of
the
assembly
who
looked
upon
it
as
less
dangerous
to
the
cause
of
religion
and
morality
than
ecclesiastical
josephism
in
the
present
conflict
between
the
church
and
the
german
empire
the
catholic
party
has
again
demanded
and
in
vain
the
separation
of
church
and
state
in
rejecting
their
urgent
request
falk
declared
that
the
leading
minds
in
england
and
america
are
already
beginning
to
regret
that
their
governments
have
so
little
control
over
the
ecclesiastical
organizations
within
their
limits
whilst
the
representatives
of
the
german
people
at
frankfort
were
abolishing
the
privileges
of
the
nobles
decreeing
the
separation
of
church
and
state
and
forgetting
the
standing
armies
the
governments
were
quietly
gathering
their
forces
marshal
radetzky
put
down
the
italian
rebellion
prince
windischgrätz
quelled
the
democracy
of
vienna
and
general
wrangel
took
possession
of
berlin
without
a
battle
russia
at
the
request
of
austria
sent
an
army
into
hungary
to
destroy
the
rebellion
in
that
country
and
the
disturbances
in
bavaria
and
in
the
palatinate
were
suppressed
by
prussian
troops
under
the
present
emperor
of
germany
the
representatives
of
the
larger
states
withdrew
from
the
frankfort
parliament
which
dwindled
and
finally
amidst
universal
contempt
and
neglect
came
to
an
end
at
stuttgart
june
but
the
liberties
of
the
church
were
not
lost
in
prussia
as
we
have
seen
a
better
state
of
things
had
begun
with
the
imprisonment
of
the
heroic
archbishop
of
cologne
in
in
the
face
of
the
menacing
attitude
of
the
german
democrats
and
republicans
frederick
william
iv
confirmed
the
liberties
of
the
catholic
church
by
the
of
the
constitutions
of
december
and
january
were
drawn
up
in
the
lurid
light
of
the
revolution
which
had
beaten
fiercest
upon
the
house
of
hohenzollern
the
king
had
capitulated
to
the
insurgents
withdrawn
his
soldiers
from
the
capital
and
abandoned
berlin
and
with
it
the
whole
state
for
nine
months
to
the
tender
mercies
of
the
mob
he
was
forced
to
witness
the
most
revolting
spectacles
the
dead
bodies
of
the
rioters
were
borne
in
procession
under
the
windows
of
his
palace
while
the
rabble
shouted
to
him
off
with
your
it
is
not
surprising
in
view
of
this
experience
that
we
should
find
in
the
constitution
of
articles
to
inclusive
a
very
satisfactory
recognition
of
the
rights
of
the
church
why
these
paragraphs
granting
the
church
freedom
to
regulate
and
administer
its
own
affairs
to
keep
possession
of
its
own
revenues
endowments
and
establishments
whether
devoted
to
worship
education
or
beneficence
and
freely
to
communicate
with
the
pope
were
inserted
in
the
constitution
we
know
from
prince
bismarck
himself
in
his
speech
in
the
prussian
upper
house
march
he
affirmed
that
were
introduced
at
a
time
when
the
state
needed
or
thought
it
needed
help
and
believed
that
it
would
find
this
help
by
leaning
on
the
catholic
church
it
was
probably
led
to
this
belief
by
the
fact
that
in
the
national
assembly
of
all
the
electoral
districts
with
a
preponderant
catholic
population
returned
i
will
not
say
royalist
representatives
but
certainly
men
who
were
the
friends
of
order
which
was
not
the
case
in
the
protestant
the
provisions
of
the
constitution
of
with
regard
to
the
church
were
honorably
and
faithfully
carried
out
down
to
the
beginning
of
the
present
conflict
never
since
the
reformation
had
the
church
in
prussia
been
so
free
never
had
she
made
such
rapid
progress
whether
in
completing
her
internal
organization
or
in
extending
her
influence
the
prussian
liberals
and
atheists
who
had
fully
persuaded
themselves
that
without
the
wealth
and
aid
of
the
state
the
catholic
religion
would
have
no
force
were
amazed
the
influence
of
the
priests
over
the
people
grew
in
proportion
as
they
were
educated
more
thoroughly
in
the
spirit
and
discipline
of
the
church
under
the
immediate
supervision
of
the
bishops
unfettered
by
state
interference
the
number
of
convents
both
of
men
and
women
rapidly
increased
associations
of
all
kinds
scientific
benevolent
and
religious
spread
over
the
land
religious
journals
and
reviews
were
founded
in
which
catholic
interests
were
ably
advocated
and
defended
and
all
the
forces
of
the
church
were
unified
and
guided
by
the
harmonious
action
of
a
most
enlightened
and
zealous
episcopate
this
was
the
more
astonishing
as
the
evangelical
church
whose
liberties
had
also
been
guaranteed
by
the
constitution
of
had
shown
itself
unable
to
profit
by
the
greater
freedom
of
action
which
it
had
received
in
fact
the
evangelical
church
was
lifeless
and
it
needed
only
this
test
to
prove
its
want
of
vitality
it
was
a
state
creation
and
in
an
age
when
the
world
had
ceased
to
recognize
the
divine
right
of
kings
to
create
religions
it
was
only
in
that
the
lutheran
and
calvinistic
churches
of
prussia
together
with
the
very
name
of
protestant
were
abolished
by
royal
edict
and
a
new
prussian
establishment
under
the
title
of
was
imposed
by
the
civil
power
upon
a
protestant
population
of
nearly
eight
millions
whose
religious
and
moral
sense
was
so
dead
that
they
seemed
to
regard
with
stolid
indifference
this
interference
of
government
with
all
that
freemen
deem
most
sacred
in
life
acts
of
parliament
may
make
but
they
can
not
inspire
religious
faith
and
life
and
it
was
therefore
not
surprising
that
when
the
mummy
of
evangelicalism
was
put
out
into
the
open
air
of
freedom
by
the
constitution
of
it
should
have
been
revealed
to
all
that
the
thing
was
dead
nevertheless
the
prussian
government
continued
to
act
toward
the
catholic
church
with
great
justice
and
even
friendliness
and
the
war
against
catholic
austria
in
wrought
no
change
in
its
ecclesiastical
policy
even
the
opening
of
the
vatican
council
caused
no
alarm
in
prussia
on
the
contrary
king
william
as
it
was
generally
believed
at
least
was
most
civil
to
the
holy
father
and
prince
bismarck
himself
at
that
time
saw
no
reason
for
apprehension
though
he
had
been
the
head
of
the
ministry
already
eight
years
to
what
then
are
we
to
attribute
sudden
change
of
attitude
toward
the
church
who
began
the
present
conflict
and
what
was
its
provocation
this
is
a
question
which
has
been
much
discussed
in
the
prussian
house
of
deputies
and
elsewhere
prince
bismarck
has
openly
asserted
in
the
house
of
deputies
within
the
past
year
that
the
provocation
was
the
definition
of
papal
infallibility
by
the
vatican
council
on
the
of
june
and
subsequently
the
hostile
attitude
of
the
party
of
the
toward
the
german
empire
herr
von
kirchmann
a
member
of
the
german
parliament
and
of
the
prussian
house
of
deputies
a
national
liberal
and
not
a
catholic
but
in
the
main
a
sympathizer
with
the
spirit
of
the
falk
legislation
has
recently
discussed
this
whole
subject
with
great
ability
and
as
far
as
it
is
possible
for
one
who
believes
in
the
hegelian
doctrine
that
state
is
the
present
also
with
fairness
to
prince
first
assertion
that
the
definition
of
papal
infallibility
was
the
unpardonable
offence
which
has
been
so
strongly
emphasized
by
gladstone
and
with
fidelity
by
the
press
of
europe
and
america
herr
von
kirchmann
makes
the
following
reply
is
difficult
to
understand
how
so
experienced
a
statesman
as
prince
bismarck
can
ascribe
to
this
decree
of
the
council
such
great
importance
for
the
states
of
europe
and
particularly
for
prussia
and
germany
to
a
theorizer
sitting
behind
his
books
such
a
decree
it
may
be
allowed
might
appear
to
be
something
portentous
since
taken
from
a
purely
theoretical
and
according
to
the
letter
the
infallibility
of
the
pope
in
all
questions
of
religion
and
morals
gives
him
unlimited
control
over
all
human
action
and
many
a
catholic
when
called
upon
to
receive
this
infallibility
as
part
of
his
faith
may
have
found
that
he
was
unable
to
follow
so
far
but
a
statesman
ought
to
know
how
to
distinguish
especially
where
there
is
question
of
the
catholic
church
between
the
literal
import
of
dogmas
and
their
use
in
practical
life
in
the
catholic
church
as
a
whole
this
infallibility
as
is
well
known
has
existed
from
the
earliest
times
its
organ
hitherto
has
been
the
ecumenical
council
in
union
with
the
pope
but
already
before
it
was
disputed
whether
the
pope
might
not
alone
act
as
the
organ
of
infallibility
in
the
question
was
decided
in
favor
of
the
pope
but
we
must
consider
that
the
ecumenical
councils
have
as
history
shows
nearly
always
framed
their
decrees
in
accordance
with
the
views
of
the
court
of
rome
and
this
of
itself
proves
that
the
change
made
in
is
rather
one
of
form
than
of
essence
especially
false
is
it
to
maintain
that
by
this
decree
a
complete
revolution
in
the
constitution
of
the
church
has
been
made
to
the
theorizer
we
might
grant
the
abstract
possibility
that
something
of
this
kind
might
some
day
or
other
happen
but
such
of
the
abuse
of
a
right
are
found
in
all
the
relations
of
public
life
in
the
state
and
its
representatives
as
well
as
in
the
church
even
in
constitutions
the
most
carefully
drawn
up
such
possibilities
are
found
in
all
directions
what
a
statesman
has
to
consider
is
not
mere
possibilities
but
the
question
whether
the
possessor
of
such
right
is
not
compelled
from
the
very
nature
of
things
to
make
of
it
only
the
most
moderate
and
prudent
use
so
long
therefore
as
the
pope
does
not
alter
the
constitution
of
the
church
that
constitution
remains
precisely
in
its
ancient
form
such
as
it
has
been
recognized
and
tolerated
by
the
state
for
centuries
and
wherever
the
relations
between
particular
states
and
the
court
of
rome
have
been
arranged
by
concordats
these
too
remain
unchanged
unless
the
states
themselves
find
it
convenient
to
depart
from
them
we
see
in
fact
that
this
infallibility
of
the
pope
has
in
no
country
of
europe
or
america
altered
one
jot
or
tittle
in
the
constitution
of
the
catholic
church
and
where
in
particular
countries
such
changes
have
taken
place
they
have
not
been
made
by
the
ecclesiastical
government
but
by
the
state
and
in
its
interest
in
germany
even
and
in
prussia
itself
the
pope
has
since
made
no
change
in
the
church
constitution
as
determined
by
the
canon
law
and
when
in
some
of
his
encyclicals
and
other
utterances
he
has
taken
up
a
hostile
attitude
towards
the
german
empire
and
the
prussian
state
he
has
done
this
only
in
defence
against
the
aggressive
legislation
of
the
civil
government
he
has
never
hesitated
to
express
his
disapprobation
of
the
new
church
laws
but
he
has
in
no
instance
touched
the
constitution
of
the
catholic
church
or
the
rights
of
the
it
seems
almost
needless
to
remark
that
there
is
no
necessary
connection
between
the
doctrine
of
papal
infallibility
and
that
of
the
essential
organization
of
the
church
that
the
jurisdiction
of
the
pope
was
as
great
and
universally
recognized
as
such
by
catholics
before
the
vatican
council
as
since
and
consequently
that
it
is
not
even
possible
that
the
definition
of
should
make
any
change
in
his
authoritative
relation
to
or
power
over
the
church
his
jurisdiction
is
wider
than
his
infallibility
and
independent
of
it
and
the
duty
of
obedience
to
his
commands
existed
before
the
dogma
was
defined
precisely
as
it
exists
now
and
therefore
it
is
clearly
manifest
that
the
vatican
decree
can
not
give
even
a
plausible
pretext
for
such
legislation
as
the
falk
laws
less
singular
continues
herr
von
kirchmann
it
sound
to
hear
the
party
of
the
in
the
reichstag
and
prussian
landtag
denounced
as
the
occasion
of
the
new
regulations
between
church
and
state
the
members
of
this
party
notoriously
represent
the
views
and
wishes
of
the
majority
of
their
constituents
and
just
as
faithfully
as
the
members
of
the
parties
who
side
with
the
government
the
reproach
that
they
receive
their
instructions
from
rome
is
not
borne
out
by
the
facts
and
if
there
were
an
understanding
with
rome
of
the
kind
which
their
adversaries
affirm
this
could
only
be
the
result
of
a
similar
understanding
on
the
part
of
their
constituents
nothing
could
more
strikingly
prove
that
the
catholic
party
faithfully
represent
the
great
majority
in
their
electoral
districts
than
the
repeated
of
the
same
representatives
or
of
men
of
similar
views
to
this
we
must
add
that
the
though
strong
in
numbers
is
yet
in
a
decided
minority
both
in
the
reichstag
and
the
prussian
landtag
and
has
always
been
defeated
in
its
opposition
to
the
recent
ecclesiastical
legislation
if
in
other
matters
by
uniting
with
opposition
parties
it
has
caused
the
government
inconvenience
we
have
no
right
to
ascribe
this
to
feelings
of
hostility
for
on
such
occasions
its
orators
have
given
substantial
political
reasons
for
their
opposition
and
instances
enough
might
be
enumerated
in
which
precisely
through
the
aid
of
the
many
illiberal
and
dangerous
projects
of
law
have
fallen
through
and
for
this
the
party
deserves
the
thanks
of
the
country
present
action
of
the
state
against
the
catholic
church
would
be
unjustifiable
if
better
grounds
could
not
be
adduced
in
its
favor
for
the
attentive
observer
however
valid
reasons
are
not
wanting
they
are
to
be
found
to
put
the
whole
matter
in
a
single
word
in
the
great
power
to
which
the
catholic
church
in
prussia
had
attained
by
the
aid
of
the
constitution
and
the
favor
of
the
government
a
power
which
if
its
growth
had
been
longer
tolerated
would
have
become
not
indeed
dangerous
to
the
existence
of
the
state
but
a
hindrance
to
the
right
fulfilment
of
the
ends
of
its
neither
the
vatican
council
then
nor
the
catholics
of
prussia
have
done
anything
to
provoke
the
present
persecution
to
find
fault
with
the
german
bishops
for
accepting
the
dogma
of
infallibility
after
having
strongly
opposed
its
definition
by
the
council
would
be
as
unreasonable
as
to
blame
a
member
of
congress
for
admitting
the
binding
force
of
a
law
the
passage
of
which
he
had
done
everything
in
his
power
to
prevent
their
duty
beyond
all
question
was
to
act
as
they
have
acted
this
was
not
the
offence
the
unpardonable
crime
was
that
the
church
as
soon
as
she
was
unloosed
from
the
fetters
of
bureaucracy
had
grown
too
powerful
we
doubt
whether
any
more
forcible
argument
in
proof
of
the
indestructible
vitality
of
the
church
can
be
found
than
that
which
may
be
deduced
from
the
universal
consent
of
her
enemies
of
whatever
shade
of
belief
or
unbelief
that
the
only
way
in
which
she
can
be
successfully
opposed
is
to
array
against
her
the
strongest
of
human
powers
that
of
the
state
a
complete
revolution
of
thought
upon
this
subject
has
taken
place
within
the
last
up
to
that
time
it
was
confidently
held
by
protestants
as
well
as
infidels
that
to
undermine
and
finally
destroy
the
church
it
would
be
simply
necessary
to
withdraw
from
her
the
support
of
the
state
that
to
her
freedom
would
necessarily
prove
fatal
the
experiment
as
it
was
thought
had
not
been
satisfactorily
tried
ireland
indeed
had
held
her
faith
for
three
hundred
years
in
spite
of
all
that
fiendish
cruelty
could
invent
to
destroy
it
but
persecution
has
always
been
the
life
of
the
faith
in
the
united
states
the
church
had
been
free
since
the
war
of
independence
but
of
us
little
was
known
and
besides
down
to
say
even
the
most
thoughtful
and
among
us
had
serious
doubts
as
to
the
future
of
the
church
in
this
country
but
with
the
emancipation
of
the
catholics
in
great
britain
the
new
constitution
of
the
kingdom
of
belgium
and
the
completer
organization
of
the
church
in
the
united
states
the
test
as
to
the
action
of
freedom
upon
the
progress
of
catholic
faith
began
to
be
applied
over
a
wide
and
varied
field
and
under
not
unfavorable
circumstances
what
the
result
has
been
we
may
learn
from
our
enemies
gladstone
expostulates
for
great
britain
and
reaches
a
hand
of
sympathy
to
emile
de
laveleye
in
belgium
falk
friedberg
and
even
the
moderate
herr
von
kirchmann
defend
the
tyrannical
as
necessary
to
stop
the
growth
of
the
church
in
germany
and
at
home
the
most
silent
of
presidents
and
the
most
garrulous
of
bishops
forgetting
that
the
cause
of
temperance
has
prior
claims
upon
their
attention
have
raised
the
cry
of
alarm
to
warn
their
of
the
dangerous
progress
of
popery
in
this
great
and
free
country
time
was
when
free
church
in
the
free
was
thought
to
be
the
proper
word
of
command
but
now
it
is
fettered
church
in
the
enslaved
state
since
no
state
that
meddles
with
the
consciences
of
its
subjects
can
be
free
if
there
is
anything
for
which
we
feel
more
especially
thankful
it
is
that
henceforth
the
cause
of
the
church
and
the
cause
of
freedom
are
inseparably
united
we
have
heard
to
satiety
that
the
catholic
church
is
the
greatest
conservative
force
in
the
world
the
most
powerful
element
of
order
in
society
the
noblest
school
of
respect
in
which
mankind
have
ever
been
taught
praised
be
god
that
now
as
in
the
early
days
he
is
making
it
impossible
that
catholics
should
not
be
on
the
side
of
liberty
as
the
church
has
always
been
so
that
all
men
may
see
that
if
we
love
order
the
more
we
love
not
liberty
the
less
will
sing
to
my
god
as
long
at
i
shall
be
wrote
an
inspired
king
not
your
trust
in
no
nor
in
governments
nor
in
states
but
in
god
who
is
the
lord
and
in
the
poor
whom
jesus
loved
from
god
out
of
the
people
came
the
church
through
god
back
to
the
people
is
she
going
we
know
there
are
still
many
catholics
who
trust
in
kings
and
believe
in
salvation
through
them
but
god
will
make
them
wiser
the
spirit
that
sits
at
the
roaring
loom
of
time
will
weave
for
them
other
garments
the
irresistible
charm
of
the
church
humanly
speaking
lies
in
the
fact
that
she
comes
closer
to
the
hearts
of
the
people
than
any
other
power
that
has
ever
been
brought
to
bear
upon
mankind
having
shown
that
the
oppressive
ecclesiastical
legislation
of
germany
was
not
provoked
by
the
church
and
that
its
only
excuse
is
the
increasing
power
of
the
church
herr
von
kirchmann
reduces
all
farther
discussion
of
this
subject
to
the
two
following
heads
how
far
ought
the
state
to
go
in
setting
bounds
to
this
power
of
the
catholic
church
and
what
means
ought
it
to
employ
in
view
of
the
dangers
with
which
every
open
breach
of
the
peace
between
church
and
state
is
fraught
for
the
people
it
would
have
been
advisable
he
thinks
from
political
motives
to
have
tried
to
settle
the
difficulty
by
a
mutual
understanding
between
the
two
powers
nor
would
it
in
his
opinion
be
derogatory
to
the
sovereignty
of
the
state
to
treat
the
church
as
an
equal
since
she
embraces
in
her
fold
all
the
catholics
of
the
world
who
have
their
directing
head
in
the
pope
whose
sovereign
ecclesiastical
power
can
not
therefore
as
a
matter
of
fact
be
called
in
question
that
prussia
did
not
make
any
effort
to
see
what
could
be
effected
by
this
policy
of
conciliation
may
in
the
opinion
of
herr
von
kirchmann
find
some
justification
in
the
fact
that
the
government
did
not
expect
and
could
not
in
foresee
the
determined
opposition
of
the
catholics
to
the
may
laws
of
at
any
rate
as
he
thinks
the
high
and
majestatic
right
of
the
state
is
supreme
and
it
alone
must
determine
in
the
ultimate
instance
how
far
and
how
long
it
will
acknowledge
any
claim
of
the
church
thus
even
this
statesman
who
is
of
the
more
moderate
school
of
prussian
politicians
holds
that
the
church
has
no
rights
which
the
state
is
bound
to
respect
that
political
interests
are
paramount
and
conscience
in
the
modern
as
in
the
ancient
pagan
state
has
no
claim
upon
the
recognition
of
the
government
english
and
american
protestants
where
their
own
interests
are
concerned
would
be
as
little
inclined
to
accept
this
doctrine
as
catholics
in
fact
this
country
was
born
of
a
protest
against
the
assumption
of
state
supremacy
over
conscience
and
yet
so
blinding
and
misleading
is
prejudice
that
the
falk
laws
receive
their
sympathy
though
herr
von
kirchmann
accepts
without
reservation
the
principles
which
underlie
the
recent
prussian
legislation
and
thinks
the
may
laws
have
been
drawn
up
with
great
wisdom
and
consummate
knowledge
of
the
precise
points
at
which
the
state
should
oppose
the
growing
power
of
the
church
he
yet
freely
admits
that
there
are
grave
doubts
whether
the
present
policy
of
prussia
on
this
subject
can
be
successfully
carried
out
that
prince
bismarck
and
falk
had
but
a
very
imperfect
knowledge
of
the
difficulties
which
lay
in
their
path
the
numerous
supplementary
bills
which
have
been
repeatedly
introduced
in
order
to
give
effect
to
the
may
laws
plainly
show
where
there
is
question
of
principle
and
of
conscience
prince
bismarck
is
not
at
home
he
believes
in
force
like
the
first
napoleon
holds
that
providence
is
always
on
the
side
of
the
biggest
cannons
sneers
about
going
to
canossa
as
napoleon
mockingly
asked
the
pope
whether
his
excommunication
would
make
the
arms
fall
from
the
hands
of
his
veterans
he
knows
the
workings
of
courts
and
is
a
master
in
the
devious
ways
of
diplomacy
he
can
estimate
with
great
precision
the
resources
of
a
country
he
has
a
keen
eye
for
the
weak
points
of
an
adversary
his
tactics
like
are
to
bring
to
bear
upon
each
given
point
of
attack
a
force
greater
than
the
he
has
in
his
public
life
never
known
what
it
is
to
respect
right
or
principle
with
the
army
at
his
back
he
has
trampled
upon
the
prussian
constitution
with
the
same
daring
recklessness
with
which
he
now
violates
the
most
sacred
rights
of
conscience
nothing
in
his
eyes
is
holy
but
success
and
he
has
been
consecrated
by
it
so
that
the
has
spread
far
beyond
the
fatherland
to
england
and
the
united
states
carlyle
has
at
last
found
a
living
hero
the
very
impersonation
of
the
brute
force
which
to
him
is
ideal
and
admirable
and
at
eighty
he
offers
incense
and
homage
to
the
idol
we
freely
give
prince
bismarck
credit
for
his
remarkable
gifts
indomitable
will
reckless
courage
practical
knowledge
of
men
considered
as
intelligent
automata
whose
movements
are
directed
by
a
kind
of
bureaucratic
and
military
mechanism
and
this
is
the
kind
of
men
with
whom
for
the
most
part
he
has
had
to
deal
for
your
thorough
prussian
though
the
wildest
of
speculators
and
the
boldest
of
theorizers
is
the
tamest
of
animals
no
poor
russian
soldier
ever
crouched
more
submissively
beneath
the
knout
than
do
the
prussian
pantheists
and
culturists
beneath
the
lash
of
a
master
like
voltaire
they
probably
prefer
the
rule
of
one
fine
lion
to
that
of
a
hundred
rats
of
their
own
sort
prince
bismarck
knew
his
men
and
we
give
him
credit
for
his
sagacity
not
every
eye
could
have
pierced
the
mist
and
froth
and
sound
and
fury
of
german
professordom
and
beheld
the
craven
heart
that
was
beneath
only
men
who
believe
in
god
and
the
soul
are
dangerous
rebels
why
should
he
who
has
no
faith
make
a
martyr
of
himself
why
since
there
is
nothing
but
law
blind
and
merciless
force
throw
yourself
beneath
the
wheels
of
the
state
juggernaut
to
be
crushed
the
religion
of
culture
is
the
religion
of
indulgence
and
no
godlike
rebel
against
tyranny
and
brute
force
ever
sprang
from
such
worship
so
long
as
prince
bismarck
had
to
deal
with
men
who
were
nourished
on
sweet
milk
and
who
worshipped
at
the
altar
of
culture
who
had
science
but
not
faith
opinions
but
not
convictions
amongst
whom
consequently
organic
union
was
impossible
his
policy
of
making
germany
blood
and
was
successful
enough
but
like
all
great
conquerors
he
longed
for
more
kingdoms
to
subdue
and
finding
right
around
him
a
large
and
powerful
body
of
german
citizens
who
did
not
accept
the
that
the
state
in
other
words
prince
bismarck
is
present
god
just
as
a
kind
of
diversion
between
victories
he
turned
to
give
a
lesson
to
the
and
clerical
who
burnt
no
incense
in
honor
of
his
divinity
in
taking
this
step
it
is
almost
needless
to
say
that
prince
bismarck
sought
to
pass
over
a
chasm
which
science
itself
does
not
profess
to
have
bridged
that
namely
which
lies
between
the
worlds
of
matter
and
of
spirit
of
the
new
conflict
upon
which
he
was
entering
he
could
have
only
vague
and
inaccurate
notions
nothing
is
so
misleading
as
contempt
a
feeling
in
which
the
wise
never
indulge
but
which
easily
becomes
habitual
with
men
spoiled
by
success
to
the
man
who
had
organized
the
armies
and
guided
the
policy
which
had
triumphed
at
sadowa
and
sedan
what
opposition
could
be
made
by
a
few
poor
priests
and
would
the
arms
fall
from
the
hands
of
the
proudest
soldiers
of
europe
because
the
were
displeased
or
why
should
not
the
model
of
the
world
make
war
upon
ignorance
and
superstition
of
the
real
nature
and
strength
of
the
forces
which
would
be
marshalled
in
this
great
battle
of
souls
a
man
of
blood
and
iron
could
form
no
just
estimate
those
who
believe
said
christ
things
are
but
what
meaning
have
these
words
for
prince
bismarck
the
soul
firm
in
its
faith
appealing
from
tyrant
kings
and
states
to
god
is
invincible
lifting
itself
to
the
infinite
it
draws
thence
a
divine
power
like
liberty
it
is
brightest
in
dungeons
in
fetters
freest
and
conquers
with
its
martyrdom
can
not
reach
it
and
above
the
deadly
roar
of
cannon
it
rises
godlike
and
supreme
though
the
giant
ages
heave
the
hill
and
break
the
shore
and
evermore
make
and
break
and
work
their
will
though
world
on
world
in
myriad
myriads
roll
round
us
each
with
different
powers
and
other
farms
of
life
than
ours
what
know
we
greater
than
the
soul
on
god
and
godlike
men
we
build
our
men
who
have
unwrapt
themselves
of
the
garb
and
vesture
of
thought
and
sentiment
with
which
the
world
had
dressed
them
out
who
have
been
born
again
into
the
higher
life
who
have
been
clothed
in
the
charity
and
meekness
of
christ
who
for
his
dear
sake
have
put
all
things
beneath
their
feet
who
love
not
the
world
who
venerate
more
the
rags
of
the
beggar
than
the
purple
of
cæsar
who
fear
as
they
love
god
alone
for
whom
life
is
no
blessing
and
death
infinite
gain
form
the
invincible
army
of
christ
foredoomed
to
conquer
is
the
victory
which
overcometh
the
world
our
who
has
ever
forgotten
those
lines
of
tacitus
inserted
as
an
altogether
trifling
circumstance
in
the
reign
of
nero
for
the
quieting
of
this
rumor
of
his
having
set
fire
to
rome
nero
judicially
charged
with
the
crime
and
punished
with
most
studied
severities
that
class
hated
for
their
general
wickedness
whom
the
vulgar
call
the
originator
of
that
name
was
one
who
in
the
reign
of
tiberius
suffered
death
by
sentence
of
the
procurator
pontius
pilate
the
baneful
superstition
thereby
repressed
for
the
time
again
broke
out
not
only
over
judea
the
native
soil
of
the
mischief
but
in
the
city
also
where
from
every
side
all
atrocious
and
abominable
things
collect
and
says
carlyle
referring
to
this
passage
the
wisest
most
penetrating
man
of
his
generation
and
to
such
depth
and
no
deeper
has
he
seen
into
this
transaction
the
most
important
that
has
occurred
or
can
occur
in
the
annals
of
we
doubt
whether
prince
bismarck
has
any
truer
knowledge
of
the
real
worth
and
power
of
the
living
catholic
faith
on
which
he
is
making
war
than
had
tacitus
eighteen
hundred
years
ago
when
writing
of
the
rude
german
barbarians
who
were
hovering
on
the
confines
of
the
roman
empire
and
who
were
to
have
a
history
in
the
world
only
through
the
action
of
that
which
he
considered
as
one
of
the
most
abominable
products
of
the
frightful
corruptions
of
his
age
that
the
prussian
government
was
altogether
unprepared
for
the
determined
though
passive
opposition
to
the
may
laws
which
the
catholics
have
made
herr
von
kirchmann
freely
confesses
it
was
not
expected
that
there
would
be
such
perfect
union
between
the
clergy
and
the
people
on
the
contrary
it
was
generally
supposed
that
with
the
aid
of
the
draconian
penalties
threatened
for
the
violation
of
the
falk
laws
the
resistance
of
the
priests
themselves
would
be
easily
overcome
these
men
love
their
own
comfort
too
much
said
the
culturists
to
be
willing
to
go
to
prison
and
live
on
beans
and
water
for
the
sake
of
technicalities
and
so
they
chuckled
over
their
pipes
and
at
the
thought
of
their
easy
victory
over
the
they
were
mistaken
and
herr
von
kirchmann
admits
that
the
courage
of
the
bishops
and
priests
has
not
been
broken
but
strengthened
by
their
sufferings
for
the
faith
long
as
we
were
permitted
to
hope
he
says
we
should
have
only
the
priests
to
deal
with
there
was
less
reason
for
doubt
as
to
the
policy
of
executing
the
laws
in
all
their
rigor
but
the
situation
was
wholly
altered
when
it
became
manifest
that
the
congregations
held
the
same
views
as
the
bishops
and
it
is
easy
to
see
that
all
violent
even
though
legal
proceedings
of
the
government
against
these
convictions
of
the
catholic
people
can
only
weaken
those
proper
and
in
the
last
instance
alone
effective
measures
through
which
the
may
laws
can
successfully
put
bounds
to
the
growing
power
of
the
church
these
measures
a
better
education
of
the
people
and
a
higher
culture
of
the
priests
can
from
the
nature
of
things
exert
their
influence
only
by
degrees
not
till
the
next
generation
can
we
hope
to
gather
the
fruit
of
this
seed
and
not
then
indeed
if
the
reckless
execution
of
the
may
laws
calls
forth
an
opposition
in
the
catholic
populations
which
will
shake
confidence
in
the
just
intentions
of
the
government
and
beget
in
the
congregations
feelings
of
hatred
for
everything
connected
with
this
legislation
such
feelings
will
unavoidably
be
communicated
to
the
children
and
the
teacher
will
in
consequence
be
deprived
of
that
authority
without
which
his
instructions
must
lack
the
persuasive
force
that
is
inherent
in
truth
in
such
a
state
of
warfare
even
the
higher
culture
of
the
clergy
must
be
useless
those
who
stand
on
the
side
of
the
government
will
precisely
on
that
account
fail
to
win
the
confidence
of
their
people
and
the
stronger
the
aged
pastors
emphasize
the
canon
law
of
the
church
the
more
energetically
they
extend
the
realms
of
faith
even
to
the
hierarchical
constitution
of
the
church
the
more
readily
and
faithfully
will
their
congregations
follow
them
can
not
be
dissembled
that
the
government
through
the
rigorous
execution
of
the
may
laws
is
raging
against
its
own
flesh
and
blood
and
is
thereby
robbing
itself
of
the
only
means
by
which
it
can
have
any
hope
of
finally
coming
forth
victorious
from
the
present
conflict
it
may
be
objected
that
the
resistance
which
is
now
so
widespread
can
not
be
much
longer
maintained
and
that
all
that
is
needed
to
crush
it
and
bring
about
peace
with
the
church
is
to
increase
the
pressure
of
the
law
assertions
of
this
kind
are
made
with
great
confidence
by
the
liberals
of
both
houses
of
the
landtag
whenever
the
government
presents
a
new
bill
and
the
liberal
newspapers
which
never
grow
tired
of
this
theme
declare
that
the
result
is
certain
and
even
near
at
hand
even
though
we
should
attach
no
importance
to
the
contrary
assertions
of
the
catholic
party
it
is
yet
evident
from
the
declarations
of
the
government
itself
that
it
is
not
all
confident
of
reaching
this
result
with
the
aid
of
the
means
which
it
has
hitherto
employed
or
of
those
in
preparation
but
that
it
is
making
ready
for
a
prolonged
resistance
of
the
clergy
who
are
upheld
and
supported
by
the
great
generosity
of
the
catholic
people
the
ovations
which
the
priests
receive
from
their
congregations
when
they
come
forth
from
prison
are
not
falling
off
but
are
increasing
and
this
is
equally
true
of
the
pecuniary
aid
given
to
them
it
is
possible
that
much
of
this
may
have
been
gotten
up
by
the
priests
themselves
as
demonstration
but
the
displeasure
of
the
still
powerful
government
officials
which
the
participants
incur
and
the
greatness
of
the
are
evidence
of
earnest
convictions
however
so
strongly
witnesses
to
the
existence
of
a
perfect
understanding
between
the
congregations
and
the
priests
as
the
fact
that
though
the
law
of
may
gave
to
those
congregations
whose
pastors
had
been
removed
or
had
not
been
legally
appointed
by
the
bishops
the
right
to
elect
a
pastor
yet
not
even
one
congregation
has
up
to
the
present
moment
made
any
use
of
this
privilege
when
we
consider
that
the
number
of
parishes
where
there
is
no
pastor
must
be
at
least
a
hundred
that
in
itself
such
right
of
choice
corresponds
with
the
wishes
of
the
congregations
farther
that
the
law
requires
for
the
validity
of
the
election
merely
a
majority
of
the
members
who
put
in
an
appearance
that
a
proposition
made
to
the
by
ten
parishioners
justifies
him
in
ordering
an
election
and
that
on
the
part
of
the
influential
officials
and
their
organs
nothing
has
been
left
undone
to
induce
the
congregations
to
demand
elections
not
easily
could
a
more
convincing
proof
of
the
perfect
agreement
of
the
people
with
their
priests
be
found
than
the
fact
that
to
this
day
in
only
two
or
three
congregations
has
it
been
possible
to
hunt
up
ten
men
who
were
willing
to
make
such
a
proposal
and
that
not
even
in
a
single
congregation
has
an
election
of
this
kind
taken
this
is
indeed
admirable
and
it
may
we
think
be
fairly
doubted
whether
in
the
whole
history
of
the
church
so
large
a
catholic
population
has
ever
under
similar
trials
shown
greater
strength
or
constancy
of
the
peculiar
nature
of
these
trials
we
shall
speak
hereafter
the
present
article
we
will
bring
to
a
close
with
a
few
remarks
upon
what
we
conceive
to
have
been
one
of
the
most
important
agencies
in
bringing
about
the
perfect
unanimity
and
harmony
of
action
between
priests
and
people
to
which
the
catholics
of
prussia
must
in
great
measure
ascribe
their
immovable
firmness
in
the
presence
of
a
most
terrible
foe
we
refer
to
those
catholic
associations
in
which
cardinals
bishops
priests
and
people
have
been
brought
into
immediate
contact
uniting
their
wisdom
and
strength
for
the
attainment
of
definite
ends
such
unions
have
nowhere
been
more
numerous
or
more
thoroughly
organized
than
in
germany
though
their
formation
is
of
recent
date
it
was
during
the
revolution
of
of
which
we
have
already
spoken
that
the
german
catholics
were
roused
to
a
more
comprehensive
knowledge
of
the
situation
and
resolved
to
combine
for
the
defence
of
their
rights
and
the
protection
of
their
religion
popular
unions
under
the
name
and
patronage
of
pius
ix
were
formed
throughout
the
fatherland
with
the
primary
object
of
bringing
together
once
a
week
large
numbers
of
catholic
men
of
every
condition
in
life
at
these
weekly
meetings
the
questions
of
the
day
in
so
far
as
they
touched
upon
catholic
interests
were
freely
discussed
and
thus
an
intelligent
and
enlightened
catholic
public
opinion
was
created
throughout
the
length
and
breadth
of
the
land
in
refuting
calumnies
against
the
church
the
speakers
never
failed
to
demand
the
fullest
liberty
for
all
catholic
institutions
on
the
occasion
of
beginning
the
restoration
and
completion
of
the
cathedral
of
cologne
the
most
religious
of
churches
the
proposition
that
an
annual
general
assembly
of
all
the
unions
should
be
held
was
made
and
received
with
boundless
enthusiasm
the
first
general
assembly
took
place
at
mayence
in
october
and
thither
came
delegates
from
austria
prussia
bavaria
saxony
hanover
and
all
the
other
states
of
germany
whose
confidence
and
earnestness
were
increased
by
the
presence
of
the
catholic
members
of
the
parliament
of
frankfort
for
the
first
time
since
apostasy
the
catholics
of
germany
breathed
the
air
of
liberty
the
bishops
assembled
at
würzburg
gave
their
solemn
approbation
to
the
great
work
and
pius
ix
sent
his
apostolic
benediction
since
that
time
general
assemblies
have
been
held
at
breslau
may
ratisbon
october
linz
mayence
münster
vienna
linz
salzburg
cologne
freyburg
prague
munich
frankfort
and
in
other
cities
down
to
the
recent
persecutions
these
assemblies
represented
a
complete
system
of
organization
in
which
no
catholic
interest
was
forgotten
every
village
and
hamlet
in
the
land
was
there
if
not
immediately
through
some
central
union
we
have
had
the
honor
of
being
present
at
more
than
one
of
these
assemblies
and
the
impressions
which
we
then
received
are
abiding
side
by
side
with
cardinals
bishops
princes
noblemen
and
the
most
learned
of
professors
sat
mechanics
carpenters
shoemakers
and
blacksmiths
not
as
in
the
act
of
worship
in
which
the
presence
of
the
most
high
god
dwarfs
our
universal
human
littlenesses
to
the
of
an
equal
insignificance
but
in
active
thought
and
for
the
furtherance
of
definite
religious
and
social
ends
the
brotherhood
of
the
race
was
there
an
accomplished
fact
and
one
felt
the
breathing
as
of
a
divine
spirit
compared
with
whose
irresistible
force
great
statesmen
and
mighty
armies
are
weak
as
the
puppets
of
a
show
we
have
not
the
space
to
describe
more
minutely
the
ends
aims
and
workings
of
the
numberless
catholic
associations
of
germany
but
we
must
express
our
deep
conviction
that
no
study
could
be
more
replete
with
lessons
of
practical
wisdom
for
the
catholics
of
the
united
states
organization
is
precisely
what
we
most
lack
our
priests
are
laborious
our
people
are
devoted
but
we
have
not
even
an
organized
catholic
public
opinion
nay
no
organ
to
serve
as
its
channel
and
make
itself
heard
of
the
whole
country
many
seem
to
think
that
the
very
question
of
the
necessity
of
catholic
education
is
still
an
open
one
for
us
and
this
is
not
surprising
since
we
have
no
system
of
catholic
education
catholic
schools
indeed
in
considerable
number
there
are
but
there
is
no
organization
the
great
need
of
the
church
in
this
country
is
the
organization
of
priests
and
people
for
the
promotion
of
catholic
interests
through
this
we
will
learn
to
know
one
another
our
views
will
be
enlarged
our
sympathies
deepened
and
the
truth
will
dawn
upon
us
that
if
we
wish
to
be
true
to
the
great
mission
which
god
has
given
us
the
time
has
come
when
american
catholics
must
take
up
works
which
do
not
specially
concern
any
one
diocese
more
than
another
but
whose
significance
will
be
as
wide
as
the
life
a
story
with
two
versions
yes
sir
this
is
brentwood
and
you
are
of
the
race
you
say
though
not
of
the
name
clarkson

surely
i
remember
well
miss
jane
brent
the
first
miss
brent
i
can
recall
married
a
clarkson
so
you
are
her
grandson
sir
then
you
are
right
welcome
to
me
and
mine

or
if
you
will
do
me
the
honor
sit
here
in
the
porch
sir
and
my
kate
will
bring
you
of
her
best
and
right
glad
will
we
be
to
wait
again
on
one
with
the
brent
blood
in
him
none
of
the
name
left
ah
clarkson
have
you
never
heard
then
but
you
must
have
heard
of
james
brent
surely
surely
he
lives
still
god
pity
him
that
you
want
to
hear
the
story
out
well
sir
no
man
living
can
tell
you
better
than
i
unless
it
be
self
settle
yourself
comfortably
clarkson
and
tell
you
all
yes
this
is
brentwood
your
founded
it
two
hundred
years
back
he
and
his
brother
james
and
william
they
began
the
work
which
was
to
grow
and
grow
into
foundries
and
factories
and
the
bank
that
was
to
ruin
all
but
telling
the
end
afore
the
beginning
the
next
two
brothers
built
the
church
you
see
there
sir
down
the
road
and
the
next
two
after
them
added
the
tower
and
founded
the
almshouses
and
then
came
the
fourth
james
and
william
brent
and
one
of
them
was
an
idiot
and
the
other
was
and
is
the
last
of
the
name
i
was
twenty
years
older
than
james
and
before
ever
he
came
into
business
had
served
with
his
father
i
watched
him
grow
up
and
i
loved
him
well
but
from
the
first
i
knew
he
was
different
from
the
rest
of
his
race
he
was
his
mother
all
over
again
a
true
mortimer
come
of
nobles
not
of
townsfolk
all
fire
and
sweetness
and
great
plans
for
good
and
happiness
but
with
little
of
the
brent
prudence
he
was
just
as
tender
of
william
as
if
he
had
had
all
the
wits
of
himself
and
used
to
spend
part
of
every
day
with
him
and
amuse
him
part
of
many
a
night
when
the
poor
gentleman
could
not
sleep
their
father
died
just
when
they
came
of
age
they
were
twins
the
last
brent
brothers
sir
and
a
great
fortune
and
responsibility
to
fall
full
and
with
no
restraint
into
such
young
hands
james
seemed
like
one
for
nigh
a
year
after
and
carried
on
everything
just
as
his
father
had
done
till
we
all
wondered
at
it
then
he
saw
miss
rose
maurice
and
loved
her
as
well
indeed
he
might
and
after
that
things
changed
she
was
as
simple
in
all
her
ways
as
she
was
beautiful
and
would
have
thought
my
cottage
good
enough
so
long
as
he
was
in
it
with
her
but
he
well
sir
i
know
he
has
kissed
the
very
ground
she
trod
on
and
he
think
a
palace
too
fine
for
her
as
soon
as
ever
he
saw
her
he
loved
her
and
set
his
soul
to
win
her
and
the
very
next
day
he
began
a
new
home
in
brentwood
where
is
it
alack
alack
sir
wait
till
ye
hear
think
for
a
bit
of
only
the
glad
days
now
you
could
not
call
it
extravagance
exactly
it
set
the
whole
town
alive
so
far
as
he
could
he
would
have
none
but
brentwood
folk
to
work
upon
the
place
where
his
bride
was
to
dwell
and
he
said
it
was
time
that
so
old
a
family
should
have
a
home
that
would
last
as
long
as
they
ah
me
as
long
as
they
of
course
there
was
a
city
architect
and
a
grand
landscape
gardener
but
oh
the
thoughtfulness
of
him
whom
we
were
proud
to
call
our
master
there
in
the
very
flush
of
his
youth
and
love
and
hope
he
took
care
of
the
widows
and
the
little
children
contrived
to
make
work
for
them
was
here
and
there
and
everywhere
and
there
was
not
a
beggar
nor
an
idler
in
brentwood
not
one
the
house
rose
stately
and
tall
he
had
chosen
a
fair
spot
for
it
where
great
trees
grew
and
brooks
were
running
all
ready
to
his
hand
and
that
city
man
why
sir
marvellous
how
he
seemed
to
understand
just
how
to
make
use
of
it
all
and
to
prune
a
little
here
and
add
a
little
there
with
vines
and
arbors
and
glades
and
a
wilderness
till
you
know
what
god
had
done
and
what
he
had
given
his
creatures
wit
to
do
and
in
the
sunniest
corner
of
the
house
brent
hall
as
they
called
it
james
chose
rooms
for
william
who
was
pleased
as
a
child
with
it
all
and
used
to
sit
day
by
day
and
watch
the
work
go
on
all
the
time
too
the
brent
were
being
added
to
and
renovated
till
there
was
none
like
them
round
about
and
the
town
streets
were
made
like
city
streets
and
the
town
itself
set
into
such
order
as
never
before
and
when
all
was
ready
the
work
of
but
three
years
sir
when
the
house
was
hung
with
pictures
and
decked
with
the
best
in
the
spring
when
the
grass
and
the
trees
were
green
and
the
flowers
were
blooming
fair
then
he
brought
her
home
and
when
i
saw
her
well
sir
first
i
thought
of
the
angels
but
next
if
i
may
say
it
and
i
wot
it
is
not
wrong
next
i
thought
of
our
blessed
lady
there
was
a
great
painting
in
the
hall
oratory
by
some
spanish
painter
they
said
murillo
yes
sir
that
is
the
name
it
looked
like
james
brent
sir
not
an
angel
but
a
woman
that
could
suffer
and
weep
and
struggle
sore
and
pure
and
stainless
would
still
remember
she
was
of
us
poor
humans
and
so
pity
and
pray
for
us
we
had
been
used
to
have
brent
come
into
our
houses
and
to
see
him
in
the
poorest
cottages
and
the
almshouses
with
smiles
and
cheery
words
and
money
but
james
gave
more
than
that
for
she
gave
herself
seen
those
soft
hands
bind
wounds
i
shrank
from
and
that
delicate
creature
seen
her
kneeling
by
beds
of
dying
sinners
while
her
face
grew
white
at
what
she
saw
and
heard
and
yet
she
praying
over
and
more
till
she
made
the
way
for
the
priest
to
come
and
she
laid
out
dead
whom
few
of
us
would
have
touched
for
hire
and
she
listened
to
the
stories
of
the
sad
and
tiresome
and
her
smile
was
sunshine
and
the
very
sight
of
her
passing
by
lifted
up
our
minds
to
god
her
husband
thwarted
her
in
nothing
what
was
there
to
thwart
her
in
he
loved
her
and
she
should
do
what
she
would
in
this
work
which
was
her
joy
then
we
had
been
used
to
see
james
in
church
regular
weekday
mass
and
sunday
mass
but
james
was
there
any
time
early
mornings
and
noons
and
nights
i
fancy
she
loved
it
better
than
the
stately
hall
after
she
came
her
husband
added
the
great
south
transept
window
from
germany
and
the
organ
that
people
came
miles
to
hear
and
he
said
it
was
her
gift
not
his
the
window
picture
is
a
great
crucifixion
and
our
lady
standing
by
understand
better
clarkson
ere
i
finish
what
it
says
to
brentwood
folk
now
the
first
year
there
was
a
daughter
only
but
the
next
there
came
a
son
after
that
for
six
long
years
there
were
no
more
children
but
then
another
son
saw
the
light
what
rejoicings
what
bonfires
what
clanging
of
bells
there
was
but
ere
night
the
clanging
changed
to
tolling
and
the
shouts
to
tears
for
the
child
died
and
when
james
came
among
us
again
very
white
and
changed
and
feeble
we
all
knew
that
with
james
and
william
we
were
seeing
the
last
brent
brothers
whatever
our
grandchildren
might
see
however
was
spared
and
james
took
heart
of
such
grace
as
that
and
said
it
would
be
brent
and
son
which
sounded
quite
as
well
when
one
was
used
to
it
and
to
make
himself
used
to
it
or
to
stifle
the
disappointment
as
i
really
think
he
began
the
brent
bank
there
had
been
a
brent
bank
here
for
years
past
and
to
it
all
brentwood
and
half
the
country
round
trusted
their
earnings
only
a
few
really
rich
people
had
much
to
do
with
it
but
men
in
moderate
circumstances
young
doctors
and
lawyers
with
growing
families
widows
orphans
seamstresses
the
factory
people
laborers
thought
there
was
no
bank
like
that
kind
spirit
showed
itself
there
as
elsewhere
and
nobody
felt
himself
too
insignificant
to
come
there
if
only
with
a
penny
often
and
often
i
sit
here
and
wonder
clarkson
why
it
all
was
why
god
ever
let
it
be
the
shame
and
the
sorrow
and
the
suffering
that
came
i
know
james
was
lavish
but
if
he
spent
much
on
himself
he
spent
much
on
others
too
and
he
made
house
as
beautiful
as
his
own
for
a
time
it
looked
as
if
blessing
was
on
him
for
he
prospered
year
by
year
and
except
for
his
dying
and
his
frail
health
his
cup
of
joy
seemed
running
over
by
and
by
came
a
year
you
may
just
remember
it
sir
a
year
of
very
hard
times
for
the
whole
country
banks
broke
and
old
houses
went
by
the
board
and
men
were
thrown
out
of
work
and
there
was
a
cry
of
distress
through
all
the
land
but
brentwood
folk
a
thought
of
fear
still
in
that
year
from
the
very
first
of
it
something
troubled
me
master
was
moody
now
and
then
went
up
to
the
city
oftener
had
letters
which
he
did
not
show
to
me
who
had
seen
all
his
business
correspondence
and
his
for
thirty
years
and
more
sometimes
he
missed
mass
and
presently
i
noted
with
a
pang
that
he
did
not
receive
the
blessed
sacrament
regular
as
he
used
and
james
was
pale
and
her
eyes
that
once
were
as
bright
and
clear
as
sunshine
grew
heavy
and
dark
and
she
looked
more
and
more
like
the
picture
in
her
oratory
but
it
made
one
very
sad
somehow
to
see
the
likeness
the
hard
times
began
at
midsummer
the
lent
after
there
was
a
mission
of
dominican
friars
here
i
was
special
busy
that
week
and
kept
at
work
till
after
midnight
one
evening
about
eight
james
came
hurriedly
into
the
office
and
asked
for
the
letters
he
turned
them
over
looked
blank
then
said
the
eleven
mail
would
surely
bring
the
one
he
wanted
and
he
should
wait
till
then
and
go
for
it
himself
for
five
minutes
or
so
he
tried
to
cast
up
some
accounts
then
too
to
be
quiet
longer
he
said
go
and
hear
the
sermon
serle
it
will
serve
to
fill
up
the
and
off
he
went
the
clock
struck
the
hour
and
the
and
the
hour
and
the
and
i
heard
the
eleven
mail
come
in
and
soon
after
step
again
but
slow
now
like
one
in
deep
thought
in
he
came
and
i
caught
a
glimpse
of
his
face
pale
and
stern
with
the
lips
hard
set
he
shut
himself
into
his
private
room
and
i
heard
him
pacing
up
and
down
then
there
came
a
pause
and
he
strode
out
again
he
seemed
very
odd
to
me
but
he
tried
to
laugh
as
he
put
down
two
slips
for
telegrams
on
my
desk
would
you
send
said
he
one
was
on
i
consent
to
all
your
the
other
was
i
will
have
nothing
more
to
do
with
it
no
matter
what
something
told
me
in
my
heart
that
though
he
was
trying
to
pass
this
off
in
his
old
way
like
a
joke
my
master
my
dear
master
was
in
a
great
strait
i
looked
up
and
answered
what
he
had
not
said
at
all
to
get
an
answer
with
words
which
rose
to
my
lips
in
spite
of
myself
says
i
what
james
would
want
you
to
send
and
then
his
ruddy
kind
face
bleached
gray
like
ashes
and
he
gave
a
groan
and
the
next
minute
he
was
gone
though
my
work
was
done
for
that
night
i
would
not
leave
the
bank
for
i
thought
he
might
come
back
and
back
he
did
come
a
full
hour
after
steady
and
grave
and
not
like
my
master
for
clarkson
the
bright
i
had
loved
so
which
with
the
too
had
never
seemed
to
leave
him
was
all
gone
out
of
his
face
and
i
knew
surely
i
never
should
see
it
there
again
he
wrote
something
quickly
then
handed
it
to
me
bidding
me
send
telegrams
to
the
bank
trustees
as
there
ordered
the
slip
which
bore
my
direction
bore
also
the
words
with
just
a
erasure
through
them
on
i
consent
to
all
your
so
for
good
or
for
ill
whichever
it
might
be
the
other
was
the
one
he
must
have
sent
these
telegrams
notified
the
trustees
of
a
most
important
meeting
to
which
they
were
summoned
and
at
that
meeting
i
had
as
usual
to
be
present
perhaps
his
colleagues
saw
no
change
in
him
but
i
who
had
served
him
long
saw
much
o
clarkson
clarkson
whatever
you
may
be
and
you
are
young
still
for
sir
one
thing
of
many
terrible
to
bear
and
got
to
be
borne
here
or
hereafter
by
them
as
err
from
uprightness
and
that
thing
is
shame
seen
him
kneel
at
the
altar
that
morning
and
she
beside
him
bless
her
where
he
got
strength
to
endure
the
penance
he
had
brought
upon
himself
else
i
know
how
he
ever
could
have
borne
it
or
have
done
it
they
sat
there
about
him
where
they
had
often
sat
before
those
fifteen
country
gentlemen
some
of
whom
had
been
his
and
his
friends
and
some
his
own
schoolmates
and
companions
and
he
stood
up
and
first
he
looked
them
calm
and
fearless
full
in
their
faces
and
then
his
voice
faltered
and
stopped
and
then
they
all
felt
that
it
was
indeed
something
beyond
ordinary
that
was
coming
ask
me
to
tell
my
shame
as
he
told
it
without
a
gloss
or
an
excuse
plain
and
bald
and
to
the
point
i
knew
and
they
knew
that
there
was
excuse
for
his
loving
and
lavish
nature
but
he
made
none
for
himself
well
no
hiding
what
all
the
world
knows
now
he
had
let
himself
be
led
away
into
speculation
and
god
pity
and
forgive
him
into
fraud
till
only
ruin
or
added
and
greater
sin
stared
him
in
the
face
then
brought
face
to
face
with
that
alternative
he
had
chosen
just
ruin
sir
there
was
dead
silence
for
a
space
till
sir
jasper
meredith
the
oldest
man
there
and
the
justest
business
man
i
ever
met
said
gravely
you
realize
brent
that
this
implies
ruin
to
others
than
to
you
he
was
not
thinking
of
himself
though
this
trouble
would
straiten
him
sorely
he
was
thinking
and
so
was
my
master
and
so
was
i
of
poor
men
and
lone
women
and
children
and
babies
made
penniless
at
a
blow
of
the
works
stopped
of
hunger
and
sickness
and
cold
james
bowed
his
head
he
could
not
speak
then
i
had
to
bring
out
the
books
and
we
went
carefully
over
them
page
by
page
it
was
like
the
day
of
judgment
itself
to
turn
over
those
accounts
and
to
read
letters
that
had
to
be
read
and
to
find
out
step
by
step
and
in
the
very
presence
of
the
man
we
had
honored
and
trusted
that
he
had
really
fallen
from
his
high
place
he
quivered
under
it
body
and
soul
but
answered
steadily
every
question
sir
jasper
put
to
him
spoke
in
such
a
way
that
i
was
sure
he
as
well
as
i
thought
of
the
last
great
day
and
was
answering
to
one
mightier
than
man
and
presently
when
they
had
reached
the
root
of
it
well
clarkson
it
was
sin
and
it
was
shame
and
i
dare
not
call
it
less
before
god
yet
it
was
sin
which
many
another
man
does
unblushingly
and
had
he
persisted
in
it
had
he
only
the
night
previous
sent
that
message
it
was
possible
and
probable
that
he
could
have
saved
himself
yet
if
i
could
have
had
my
choice
then
or
now
i
would
rather
have
seen
him
stand
there
disgraced
and
ruined
by
his
own
act
and
will
than
have
had
him
live
for
another
day
a
hypocrite
but
sir
jasper
said
never
a
word
of
praise
or
blame
till
the
whole
investigation
was
ended
listened
silently
while
james
told
his
plan
to
sell
all
he
owned
in
brentwood
pay
what
debts
he
could
and
then
begin
life
over
again
abroad
and
work
hard
and
steadily
to
retrieve
his
fortunes
that
he
might
pay
all
and
stand
with
a
clear
conscience
before
he
died
then
sir
jasper
rose
and
came
to
him
put
his
two
hands
on
shoulders
and
looked
him
straight
in
the
eyes
brent
he
said
knew
your
father
before
you
and
your
father
but
i
never
honored
them
more
and
i
never
honored
you
more
than
on
this
day
when
you
confess
to
having
disgraced
your
name
and
theirs
but
have
had
the
honesty
and
manliness
to
confess
it
disgrace
is
disgrace
but
confession
is
the
beginning
of
that
was
all
there
was
no
offer
of
money
help
all
sir
jasper
could
offer
would
have
been
but
a
drop
in
the
ocean
of
such
utter
ruin
there
was
no
advice
to
spare
himself
before
he
spared
his
neighbor
sir
jasper
was
too
just
for
that
but
after
those
words
i
saw
my
eyes
grow
moist
and
bright
and
a
gleam
of
hope
come
into
his
face
my
poor
master
my
poor
master
thank
god
we
can
not
see
the
whole
of
suffering
at
the
beginning
the
intention
was
not
to
let
the
news
get
abroad
that
night
james
went
home
to
tell
his
wife
and
children
how
terrible
that
seemed
to
me
and
i
sat
busy
in
the
office
it
was
the
spring
of
the
year
fifteen
years
ago
the
coming
month
he
had
brought
his
bride
home
in
the
sunshine
and
the
flowers
this
afternoon
darkened
into
clouds
and
rain
came
and
the
east
wind
i
lighted
the
lamps
early
and
went
to
my
work
again
presently
i
heard
a
sound
such
as
i
never
heard
before
a
low
growl
or
roar
or
shout
that
thunder
or
wind
or
rain
it
grew
louder
it
was
like
the
tramp
of
many
feet
hurrying
fast
and
in
the
direction
of
the
bank
then
cries
a
name
short
distinct
repeated
again
and
again
brent
james
brent
i
went
to
the
window
there
they
were
half
brentwood
and
more
clamoring
for
the
sight
of
the
man
they
trusted
above
all
men
i
flung
the
window
up
and
they
saw
me
there
joseph
serle
cried
the
leader
a
choleric
scot
who
had
not
been
many
years
among
us
our
master
here
says
i
with
a
sinking
at
my
heart
knows
piped
a
shrill
voice
him
tell
us
and
then
the
scot
cries
again
joseph
serle
there
speak
us
true
mon
or
hang
is
our
money
safe
what
could
i
say
face
after
face
i
saw
by
the
glare
of
torches
faces
of
neighbors
and
friends
and
kin
and
not
one
but
was
a
loser
and
few
that
were
not
ruined
and
while
i
hesitated
how
to
speak
again
that
woman
spoke
james
brent
has
he
run
the
coward
that
was
too
much
home
cried
i
you
and
all
decent
folk
should
home
they
caught
the
word
and
shouted
it
go
home
too
find
james
and
the
tide
turned
towards
the
hall
i
flew
down
the
to
the
stable
mounted
the
fleetest
horse
and
galloped
him
bareback
to
brent
hall
but
fast
as
i
rode
the
east
wind
bore
an
angry
shout
behind
me
and
if
i
turned
my
head
i
saw
torches
flaring
and
the
ground
seemed
to
tremble
with
the
hurrying
tramp
of
feet
i
know
how
they
bore
it
or
how
i
told
i
know
i
found
them
together
him
and
her
and
she
was
as
if
she
had
not
shed
a
tear
and
her
eyes
were
glowing
like
stars
bright
and
tender
and
sad
and
glad
all
at
once
i
had
hardly
time
to
tell
the
news
when
the
sound
i
had
dreaded
for
broke
upon
us
like
the
rush
and
the
roar
of
an
awful
storm
on
they
came
trampling
over
the
waving
their
torchlights
calling
one
name
hoarse
and
constant
brent
james
brent
love
he
said
bending
down
to
her
while
i
go
to
and
then
she
looked
at
him
with
a
look
that
was
more
heavenly
than
any
smile
and
said
only
my
place
is
by
your
side
and
i
will
keep
he
put
his
hand
quick
over
his
eyes
like
one
in
great
awe
smiled
with
a
smile
more
sad
than
tears
then
opened
the
hall
door
and
stood
out
before
the
crowd
there
where
many
a
man
and
woman
of
them
had
seen
him
bring
his
young
bride
home
and
the
sudden
silence
which
fell
upon
them
his
own
voice
broke
friends
he
said
would
you
have
of
me
straight
and
keen
as
a
barbed
arrow
not
from
one
voice
but
from
many
the
question
rose
our
money
safe
and
after
that
some
one
called
trust
your
word
master
all
i
had
thought
that
scene
in
the
bank
was
like
the
judgment
day
but
what
was
this
he
tried
to
speak
but
his
lips
clave
together
then
i
saw
her
draw
a
little
nearer
not
to
touch
him
or
to
speak
to
him
she
did
not
even
look
at
him
neither
at
the
people
but
out
into
the
darkness
and
up
and
far
away
and
her
very
body
it
seemed
to
me
was
praying
our
money
safe
it
was
like
a
yell
now
and
james
brent
made
answer
friends
i
am
a
ruined
our
money
safe
little
voices
joined
in
the
cry
my
god
let
brentwood
never
hear
the
like
again
my
master
held
out
his
hands
like
any
beggar
then
he
fell
down
upon
his
knees
confess
to
you
and
to
god
he
said
is
not
one
penny
clarkson
i
am
brentwood
born
and
bred
i
love
my
master
but
i
love
my
place
and
people
too
we
are
a
simple
folk
and
a
loving
folk
it
is
an
awful
thing
to
shake
the
trust
of
such
they
had
deemed
their
honor
and
their
property
for
ever
safe
with
this
one
man
and
in
an
hour
and
at
a
word
their
trust
was
broken
their
scanty
all
was
gone
their
earthly
hopes
were
shattered
clarkson
sir
it
drove
them
wild
that
day
had
set
on
brent
hall
fair
and
stately
the
morrow
dawned
on
blackened
ruins
the
grounds
lay
waste
the
fountains
were
dry
pictures
which
nobles
had
envied
had
fed
the
flames
fabrics
which
would
have
graced
a
queen
stopped
the
babbling
of
the
brooks
and
in
front
of
brent
bank
hung
effigies
of
the
last
brent
brothers
with
a
halter
about
the
neck
of
each
he
had
planned
my
master
my
poor
master
to
retrieve
all
why
could
it
not
be
god
knows
best
but
it
is
a
mystery
which
i
can
not
fathom
that
horror
and
exposure
brought
him
to
the
very
gates
of
death
and
when
he
rose
up
at
last
it
was
as
a
mere
wreck
of
himself
never
to
work
again
his
dowry
went
to
the
people
whom
he
had
ruined
and
who
had
ruined
him
they
lived
until
her
death
as
he
lives
still
on
charity
and
that
is
all
no
clarkson
not
quite
all
he
was
brave
enough
since
he
could
not
win
back
his
honor
otherwise
to
stay
among
us
and
gain
a
place
again
in
the
hearts
he
had
wounded
sore
sometimes
i
think
he
teaches
us
a
better
lesson
old
and
alone
and
poor
than
if
he
had
come
to
build
his
fallen
home
once
more
i
think
sir
we
have
learned
to
pity
and
forgive
as
we
never
should
have
done
otherwise
since
we
have
seen
him
suffering
like
any
one
of
us
as
low
down
as
any
one
of
us
james
version
he
has
told
you
the
story
then
my
boy
has
he
and
you
are
the
last
of
us
and
you
have
my
name
james
brent
clarkson
the
last
then
i
will
tell
you
more
than
he
could
tell
you
do
not
shrink
or
fancy
it
will
pain
me
i
would
like
to
let
you
know
all
my
boy
not
for
my
sake
but
you
say
you
are
only
half
a
catholic
and
i
would
have
you
learn
something
of
the
deep
reality
of
the
true
faith
the
night
i
waited
for
the
eleven
train
i
had
been
stopped
on
my
way
to
the
bank
by
a
crowd
at
the
church
door
and
i
heard
one
man
say
to
another
dark
times
neighbor
as
dark
as
our
seen
these
hundred
and
his
mate
answered
him
so
collins
maybe
so
but
brentwood
feel
much
i
believe
and
so
does
most
folks
that
if
all
other
houses
fell
and
the
bank
of
england
broke
brent
brothers
would
stand
been
honest
and
true
for
four
generations
back
and
so
be
to
the
end
then
the
crowd
parted
the
men
went
into
the
church
and
i
passed
down
the
street
and
true
for
four
generations
back
and
so
be
to
the
end
the
words
haunted
me
at
last
in
desperation
to
rid
myself
of
the
thought
i
went
to
church
also
going
in
by
a
side
door
i
found
myself
in
a
corner
by
a
confessional
quite
sheltered
from
view
but
with
the
pulpit
in
plain
sight
there
raised
high
above
the
heads
of
the
people
the
preacher
stood
a
man
of
middle
age
who
looked
as
if
he
had
been
at
some
time
of
his
life
in
and
of
the
world
his
face
that
of
one
who
has
found
it
almost
a
to
subdue
self
to
the
obedience
and
the
folly
of
the
cross
he
seemed
meant
for
a
ruler
among
his
fellows
i
wondered
idly
what
he
was
doing
there
in
the
frock
speaking
to
the
crowd
he
was
telling
simply
and
plainly
of
our
agony
in
the
garden
but
simple
and
plain
as
were
his
words
there
was
something
in
the
face
and
voice
which
drew
one
into
sympathetic
union
with
this
man
who
spoke
as
if
he
were
literally
beholding
the
load
of
our
sin
lying
upon
the
heart
till
his
sweat
of
blood
started
and
when
he
had
painted
the
scene
to
us
he
paused
as
hearing
the
awful
cry
echo
through
the
stillness
that
reigned
in
the
crowded
church
then
bent
forward
as
if
his
eyes
would
scan
our
very
hearts
and
spoke
once
more
i
can
not
tell
you
what
he
said
but
before
he
ended
i
knew
this
my
sin
cost
our
agony
added
sin
of
mine
would
be
added
anguish
of
his
the
choice
lay
before
me
when
i
showed
serle
those
two
despatches
the
one
the
other
on
i
held
there
what
would
be
my
ruin
for
time
or
for
eternity
there
is
a
world
unseen
and
mighty
its
powers
were
round
me
that
night
like
an
army
hitherto
i
had
been
deceiving
myself
with
the
plea
of
necessity
of
interests
to
be
considered
of
my
honor
to
be
sustained
that
night
another
motive
rose
before
me
but
it
was
of
an
honor
put
to
dishonor
the
lord
of
glory
bowed
down
to
the
earth
by
shame
the
letter
must
be
answered
before
morning
so
pressing
was
my
need
i
decided
to
go
to
the
telegraph
office
and
by
the
time
i
reached
it
my
mind
must
be
made
up
but
in
the
street
i
came
face
to
face
with
the
preacher
i
had
heard
that
night
the
moon
was
near
the
full
we
two
looked
straight
at
each
other
passed
then
turned
as
by
one
impulse
and
faced
again
they
who
fight
a
fight
to
its
end
and
conquer
but
only
with
wounds
whose
scars
they
must
bear
to
their
graves
sometimes
gain
a
great
power
of
reading
the
souls
of
those
who
are
fighting
a
like
contest
and
know
not
yet
if
it
will
end
in
victory
or
defeat
some
fight
like
mine
i
felt
sure
that
priest
had
fought
would
you
have
my
brother
he
asked
to
two
questions
father
i
replied
a
man
has
done
wrong
to
others
and
can
only
repair
it
by
added
wrong
shall
he
disgrace
his
own
good
name
for
ever
by
avowal
or
shall
he
sin
and
if
his
fall
involves
the
suffering
of
his
innocent
wife
and
children
may
he
not
save
himself
from
shame
for
their
sake
it
is
a
matter
which
may
not
wait
now
for
confession
even
answer
as
best
you
may
for
the
love
of
i
fancied
that
the
stern
face
before
me
softened
and
grew
pale
and
in
the
momentary
stillness
i
understood
that
the
dominican
was
praying
then
he
answered
few
words
and
firm
as
one
who
choose
disgrace
is
to
choose
the
path
our
divine
lord
chose
to
involve
our
dearest
in
suffering
is
to
know
his
anguish
whose
blessed
mother
stood
beneath
his
then
after
one
more
slight
intense
silence
brother
he
said
earnestly
do
not
know
your
life
but
i
know
my
own
to
drink
the
cup
of
shame
to
its
dregs
is
a
blessed
thing
to
do
if
he
gives
a
sinner
grace
to
do
tell
me
a
thousand
times
that
you
have
no
faith
yourself
that
to
love
god
passionately
is
a
dream
a
delusion
unworthy
of
our
manly
nature
that
to
choose
shame
is
folly
to
choose
suffering
is
a
mad
mistake
what
shame
could
atone
for
my
sins
or
give
back
to
the
poor
the
means
of
which
my
folly
had
robbed
them
what
can
your
words
count
with
those
who
have
once
tasted
the
bitter
sweetness
of
the
own
chalice
suddenly
standing
there
i
knew
what
it
means
to
love
god
more
than
houses
or
lands
wife
or
children
to
have
him
more
real
to
the
soul
than
they
to
the
heart
to
be
willing
and
glad
to
forsake
all
for
him
to
know
i
had
one
more
chance
left
to
do
his
will
not
and
to
make
my
choice
having
brought
his
agony
on
him
there
was
nothing
more
i
do
but
bear
it
with
him
my
boy
though
you
came
on
my
invitation
you
chose
the
twilight
in
which
to
come
to
me
that
i
might
hide
my
shame
at
meeting
you
such
shame
in
two
awful
nights
and
days
first
confession
before
the
priest
of
god
then
to
colleagues
and
friends
then
to
my
wife
and
to
my
son
oh
that
stings
yet
then
to
an
angry
throng
whose
trust
i
had
betrayed
whose
hopes
i
had
blasted
whose
love
and
reverence
i
had
turned
to
hate
and
scorn
i
have
seen
my
home
in
ruins
my
effigy
hung
up
and
hooted
at
in
the
public
square
my
name
become
a
byword
my
race
blotted
out
i
am
an
old
man
now
and
still
they
tell
my
story
in
brentwood
each
child
learns
it
strangers
hear
of
it
yet
if
the
power
were
mine
to
alter
these
twenty
years
of
humiliation
i
would
not
lose
one
hour
of
suffering
or
shame
you
ask
me
why
years
ago
i
stood
here
the
centre
and
the
favorite
of
this
town
and
i
set
myself
to
work
my
own
will
to
gain
glory
for
me
and
mine
my
wife
my
name
my
home
were
my
idols
it
seemed
an
innocent
ambition
but
it
was
not
for
god
and
it
led
me
into
evil
work
you
told
me
that
since
you
came
of
age
you
have
been
but
once
to
confession
it
is
by
the
light
of
that
sacrament
that
what
seems
to
you
the
mystery
of
my
life
is
read
for
a
catholic
whether
striving
after
perfection
or
struggling
up
from
sin
to
lasting
penitence
has
for
pattern
the
life
of
jesus
the
doing
all
in
union
with
him
after
his
example
what
is
the
sacrament
of
penance
but
the
bearing
of
shame
though
in
the
presence
of
a
compassionate
priest
with
him
who
when
he
could
have
rescued
us
at
the
price
of
one
drop
of
his
most
precious
blood
chose
to
die
in
ignominy
bearing
before
the
world
the
entire
disgrace
my
boy
if
in
any
way
by
the
love
of
our
common
name
i
can
influence
you
back
to
it
is
the
very
sacrament
for
men
who
would
be
upright
and
loyal
and
strong
and
true
or
who
having
fallen
would
humbly
and
bravely
bear
for
sake
the
disclosure
and
the
penalty
my
penance
given
by
god
mark
you
was
heavy
men
think
was
it
heavier
than
my
sin
they
do
not
know
everything
all
my
life
i
had
been
helped
guarded
upheld
and
for
such
to
fall
is
a
deadlier
sin
than
for
others
the
infinite
love
of
god
bore
with
me
and
saved
me
and
as
day
by
day
like
the
unremitted
lashes
of
a
scourge
suffering
fell
to
my
portion
i
tell
you
that
a
strange
an
awful
sweetness
mingled
with
the
anguish
i
knew
it
was
the
hand
of
god
that
smote
me
and
that
he
smote
here
to
spare
hereafter
oh
do
not
look
at
me
stop
turn
your
face
away
i
thought
all
such
shame
was
dead
but
there
are
moments
when
it
overwhelms
me
with
its
sting
did
i
say
or
dare
to
think
that
loves
wait
wait
till
i
can
remember
what
it
means
yes
i
know
now
through
all
that
night
while
the
torches
glared
and
wrathful
faces
looked
curses
at
me
and
lips
shouted
them
ever
through
all
i
saw
as
it
were
one
sinless
but
reputed
with
the
wicked
stripped
of
his
garments
as
i
of
my
pride
made
a
spectacle
to
angels
and
to
men
mocked
reviled
scourged
crucified
and
through
the
wild
tumult
i
heard
a
voice
say
as
of
old
to
the
repentant
thief
on
the
cross
day
thou
shalt
be
with
and
through
all
my
heart
was
answering
to
his
most
sacred
heart
indeed
justly
for
i
receive
the
due
reward
of
my
deeds
but
this
man
hath
done
no
how
could
i
wish
to
be
spared
a
single
pang
or
lose
one
hour
of
shame
with
him
what
part
could
any
christian
take
but
to
suffer
with
him
having
made
him
suffer
and
when
one
has
said
him
one
has
explained
all
but
somehow
people
do
not
always
seem
to
understand
understand
ah
no
it
is
a
story
not
of
two
versions
but
of
many
some
called
james
brent
a
fool
and
some
a
madman
and
some
said
he
should
have
saved
his
honor
and
his
name
at
all
hazards
and
some
that
he
had
no
right
to
entail
such
suffering
on
his
household
but
there
is
one
light
by
which
such
stories
should
be
read
that
is
truer
than
these
when
time
is
gone
and
wealth
is
dust
and
earthly
honor
vanishes
like
smoke
then
by
the
standard
of
the
cross
of
christ
wealth
and
pomp
and
pleasure
and
business
shall
be
duly
tried
shun
humiliation
here
as
we
will
there
shall
be
after
this
the
judgment
when
the
prince
of
glory
who
pronounces
final
sentence
will
be
he
who
while
on
earth
chose
for
his
portion
a
life
of
suffering
and
a
death
of
shame
movements
in
the
united
states
like
commercial
panics
periodical
outbursts
of
irreligious
fanaticism
seem
to
have
become
regular
incidents
in
the
history
of
the
united
states
occurrences
to
be
looked
for
with
as
much
certainty
as
if
they
were
the
natural
outgrowth
of
our
civilization
and
the
condition
of
american
society
though
springing
from
widely
different
causes
these
intermittent
spasms
have
a
marked
resemblance
in
their
deleterious
effects
on
our
individual
welfare
and
national
reputation
both
are
demoralizing
and
degrading
in
their
tendencies
and
each
in
its
degree
finally
results
in
the
temporary
gain
of
a
few
to
the
lasting
injury
and
debasement
of
the
multitude
in
other
respects
they
differ
materially
great
mercantile
reverses
and
isolated
acts
of
peculation
unfortunately
are
not
limited
to
one
community
or
to
the
growth
of
any
particular
system
of
polity
but
are
as
common
and
as
frequent
in
despotic
asia
and
monarchical
europe
as
in
republican
america
popular
ebullitions
of
bigotry
on
the
contrary
are
or
more
correctly
ought
to
be
confined
to
those
countries
where
ignorance
and
intolerance
usurp
the
place
of
enlightened
philanthropy
and
wise
government
they
are
foreign
to
the
spirit
of
american
institutions
hostile
to
the
best
interests
of
society
and
a
curse
to
those
who
tolerate
or
encourage
them
the
brightest
glory
of
the
fathers
of
the
republic
springs
not
so
much
from
the
fact
that
they
separated
the
colonies
from
the
mother
country
and
founded
a
new
nation
for
that
is
nothing
strange
or
in
the
history
but
that
they
made
its
three
millions
of
inhabitants
free
as
well
as
independent
free
not
only
from
unjust
taxation
and
arbitrary
laws
but
for
ever
free
to
worship
their
creator
according
to
the
dictates
of
their
conscience
unawed
by
petty
authority
and
unaffected
by
the
shifting
counsels
of
subsequent
legislators
from
this
point
of
view
the
revolution
appears
as
one
of
the
grandest
moral
events
in
the
records
of
human
progress
and
when
we
reflect
on
the
numerous
pains
penalties
and
restrictions
prescribed
by
the
charters
and
of
the
colonies
from
whence
our
union
has
sprung
it
challenges
our
most
profound
admiration
and
gratitude
this
complete
religious
equality
guaranteed
by
our
fundamental
law
has
ever
been
the
boast
of
every
true
american
citizen
at
home
and
abroad
from
the
halls
of
congress
to
the
far
western
we
hear
it
again
and
again
enunciated
it
is
repeated
by
a
thousand
eloquent
tongues
on
each
recurring
anniversary
of
our
independence
and
is
daily
and
weekly
trumpeted
throughout
the
length
and
breadth
of
the
land
by
the
mercuries
of
the
press
this
freedom
of
worship
freedom
of
conscience
and
legal
equality
as
declared
and
confirmed
by
our
forefathers
has
become
in
fact
not
only
the
written
but
also
the
common
law
of
the
land
the
birthright
of
every
american
the
acquired
but
no
less
sacred
privilege
of
every
citizen
by
adoption
whoever
now
attempts
to
disturb
or
question
it
by
word
or
act
disgraces
his
country
in
the
eyes
of
all
mankind
and
defiles
the
memory
of
our
greatest
and
truest
heroes
and
statesmen
so
powerful
indeed
were
the
example
and
teachings
of
those
wise
men
who
laid
broad
and
deep
the
foundations
of
our
happy
country
that
during
the
first
of
our
national
existence
scarcely
a
voice
was
raised
in
opposition
or
protest
against
the
principle
of
religious
liberty
as
emphatically
expressed
in
the
first
amendment
to
the
constitution
a
whole
generation
had
to
pass
away
ere
fanaticism
dared
to
raise
its
crest
until
the
solemn
guarantees
of
our
federal
compact
were
assailed
by
incendiary
mobs
and
scouted
by
courts
of
justice
the
first
flagrant
instance
of
this
fell
spirit
of
bigotry
happened
in
massachusetts
and
naturally
was
directed
against
an
institution
of
catholic
learning
in
four
ursuline
nuns
arrived
in
boston
and
established
there
a
house
of
their
order
six
years
later
they
removed
to
the
neighboring
village
of
charlestown
where
they
purchased
a
piece
of
ground
and
calling
it
mt
benedict
erected
a
suitable
building
and
reduced
the
hitherto
barren
to
a
state
of
beautiful
cultivation
in
the
community
had
increased
to
ten
all
ladies
of
thorough
education
and
refinement
from
the
very
beginning
their
success
as
teachers
was
acknowledged
and
applauded
and
their
average
attendance
of
pupils
was
computed
at
from
fifty
to
sixty
of
these
at
least
were
protestants
the
daughters
of
the
best
american
families
not
only
of
new
england
but
of
the
middle
and
southern
states
though
it
was
well
known
that
the
nuns
had
ever
been
most
scrupulously
careful
not
to
meddle
with
the
religious
opinions
of
their
scholars
and
that
not
one
conversion
to
the
church
could
be
ascribed
to
their
influence
the
fact
that
a
school
conducted
by
catholic
religious
should
have
acquired
so
brilliant
a
reputation
and
that
its
patrons
were
principally
protestants
of
high
social
and
political
standing
was
considered
sufficient
in
the
eyes
of
the
puritan
fanatics
to
condemn
it
its
destruction
was
therefore
resolved
on
and
an
incident
unimportant
in
itself
occurred
in
the
summer
of
which
was
eagerly
seized
upon
by
the
clerical
adventurers
who
then
as
now
disgraced
so
many
sectarian
pulpits
it
appears
that
an
inmate
of
the
convent
a
miss
harrison
had
from
excessive
application
to
music
become
partially
demented
and
during
one
of
her
moments
of
hallucination
left
the
house
and
sought
refuge
with
some
friends
her
brother
a
protestant
having
heard
of
her
flight
accompanied
by
bishop
fenwick
brought
her
back
to
the
nunnery
to
her
own
great
satisfaction
and
the
delight
of
the
sisterhood
this
trifling
domestic
affair
was
eagerly
taken
up
by
the
leaders
of
the
faction
and
magnified
into
monstrous
proportions
the
nuns
it
was
said
had
not
only
driven
an
american
lady
to
madness
but
had
immured
her
in
a
dungeon
and
upon
her
attempting
to
escape
had
with
the
connivance
of
the
bishop
and
priests
actually
tortured
her
to
death
falsehoods
even
more
diabolical
were
invented
and
circulated
throughout
boston
the
following
sunday
the
methodist
and
congregational
churches
rang
again
with
denunciations
against
popery
and
nunneries
while
one
divine
a
beecher
the
father
of
a
numerous
progeny
of
male
and
female
evangelists
some
of
whom
have
since
become
famous
in
more
senses
than
one
preached
no
less
than
three
sermons
in
as
many
different
churches
on
the
abominations
of
rome
all
the
bigotry
of
boston
and
the
adjacent
towns
was
aroused
to
the
highest
pitch
of
frenzy
and
threats
against
the
convent
were
heard
on
every
side
to
pacify
the
public
mind
the
selectmen
of
charlestown
on
the
following
day
the
memorable
of
august
appointed
a
committee
to
examine
into
the
truth
of
the
charges
they
waited
on
the
nuns
and
were
received
by
miss
harrison
who
was
alleged
to
have
been
foully
murdered
under
her
personal
guidance
they
searched
every
part
of
the
convent
and
its
appurtenances
till
becoming
thoroughly
satisfied
with
the
falsity
of
the
reports
they
retired
to
draw
up
a
statement
to
that
effect
for
publication
in
the
newspapers
this
was
what
the
rabble
dreaded
and
as
soon
as
the
intention
of
the
committee
became
known
the
leaders
resolved
to
forestall
public
sentiment
by
acting
at
once
accordingly
about
nine
in
the
evening
a
mob
began
to
collect
in
the
neighborhood
of
mt
benedict
bonfires
were
lit
and
exciting
harangues
were
made
but
still
there
were
many
persons
reluctant
to
believe
that
the
rioters
were
in
earnest
they
would
not
admit
that
any
great
number
of
americans
could
be
found
base
and
brutal
enough
to
attack
a
house
filled
with
defenceless
and
delicate
women
and
children
they
were
mistaken
however
they
had
yet
to
learn
to
what
lengths
fanaticism
can
be
carried
when
once
the
evil
passions
of
corrupt
human
nature
are
aroused
towards
midnight
a
general
alarm
was
rung
calling
out
the
engine
companies
of
boston
not
to
quell
any
fire
or
disturbance
but
as
was
proved
by
their
conduct
to
reinforce
the
rioters
if
necessary
the
first
demonstration
was
made
by
firing
shot
and
stones
against
the
windows
and
doors
of
the
main
building
to
ascertain
if
there
were
any
defenders
inside
but
upon
becoming
satisfied
that
there
were
none
the
cowardly
mob
burst
open
the
gates
and
doors
and
rushed
wildly
through
the
passages
and
rooms
swearing
vengeance
against
the
nuns
trusting
to
the
protection
of
the
authorities
the
gentle
sisters
were
taken
by
surprise
the
shots
of
their
assailants
however
awakened
them
to
a
sense
of
danger
hastening
from
their
beds
they
rushed
to
the
dormitories
aroused
the
sleeping
children
and
had
barely
time
to
avoid
the
fury
of
the
mob
by
escaping
through
a
back
entrance
in
their
everything
portable
including
money
and
jewelry
belonging
to
the
pupils
was
laid
hold
of
by
the
intruders
the
furniture
and
valuable
musical
instruments
were
hacked
in
pieces
and
then
the
convent
was
given
to
the
flames
amid
the
frantic
cheers
of
assembled
thousands
content
with
all
this
says
the
report
of
committee
burst
open
the
tomb
of
the
establishment
rifled
it
of
the
sacred
vessels
there
deposited
wrested
the
plates
from
the
coffins
and
exposed
to
view
the
mouldering
remains
of
their
tenants
nor
is
it
the
least
humiliating
feature
in
this
scene
of
cowardly
and
audacious
violation
of
all
that
man
ought
to
hold
sacred
that
it
was
perpetrated
in
the
presence
of
men
vested
with
authority
and
of
multitudes
of
our
while
not
one
arm
was
lifted
in
the
defence
of
helpless
women
and
children
or
in
vindication
of
the
violated
laws
of
god
and
man
the
spirit
of
violence
sacrilege
and
plunder
reigned
the
morning
of
the
of
august
saw
what
for
years
had
been
the
quiet
retreat
of
christian
learning
and
feminine
holiness
a
mass
of
blackened
ruins
but
the
character
of
massachusetts
had
received
even
a
darker
stain
a
foul
blot
not
yet
wiped
from
her
escutcheon
it
was
felt
by
the
most
respectable
portion
of
the
citizens
that
some
step
should
be
taken
to
vindicate
the
reputation
of
the
state
and
to
place
the
odium
of
the
outrage
on
those
who
alone
were
guilty
accordingly
a
committee
of
leading
protestant
gentlemen
with
charles
loring
as
chairman
was
appointed
to
investigate
and
report
on
the
origin
and
results
of
the
disgraceful
proceeding
it
met
in
faneuil
hall
from
day
to
day
examined
a
great
number
of
witnesses
and
made
the
most
minute
inquiries
from
all
sources
its
final
report
was
long
eloquent
and
convincing
after
the
most
thorough
examination
it
was
found
those
protestant
gentlemen
said
that
all
the
wild
and
malicious
assertions
put
forth
in
the
sectarian
pulpits
and
repeated
in
the
newspapers
regarding
the
ursulines
were
without
a
shadow
of
truth
or
probability
they
eulogized
in
the
most
glowing
language
the
conduct
of
the
nuns
their
qualifications
as
teachers
their
christian
piety
and
meekness
and
their
careful
regard
for
the
morals
as
well
as
for
the
religious
scruples
of
their
pupils
they
also
attributed
the
wanton
attack
upon
the
nunnery
to
the
fell
spirit
of
bigotry
evoked
by
the
false
reports
of
the
new
england
press
and
the
unmitigated
slanders
of
the
preachers
and
called
upon
the
legislative
authorities
to
indemnify
in
the
most
ample
manner
the
victims
of
mob
law
and
official
connivance
but
the
most
significant
fact
brought
to
light
by
this
committee
was
that
the
fanatics
in
their
attack
on
mt
benedict
were
not
a
mere
heterogeneous
crowd
of
ignorant
men
acting
upon
momentary
impulse
but
a
regular
band
of
lawless
miscreants
directed
and
aided
by
persons
of
influence
and
standing
in
society
is
no
doubt
says
the
report
a
conspiracy
had
been
formed
extending
into
many
of
the
neighboring
towns
but
the
committee
are
of
opinion
that
it
embraced
very
few
of
respectable
character
in
society
though
some
such
may
perhaps
be
actually
guilty
of
an
offence
no
less
heinous
morally
considered
in
having
excited
the
feelings
which
led
to
the
design
or
countenanced
and
instigated
those
engaged
in
its
here
we
find
laid
down
on
the
most
unquestionable
authority
the
origin
and
of
all
subsequent
native
american
movements
against
catholicity
but
the
sequel
to
the
destruction
of
the
charlestown
convent
was
even
more
shameful
than
the
crime
itself
thirteen
men
had
been
arrested
eight
of
whom
were
charged
with
arson
the
first
tried
was
the
ringleader
an
named
buzzell
the
scenes
which
were
enacted
on
that
occasion
are
without
a
parallel
in
the
annals
of
our
jurisprudence
the
several
of
the
sisters
and
bishop
fenwick
necessary
witnesses
for
the
prosecution
were
received
in
court
with
jibes
and
sneers
subjected
to
every
species
of
insult
by
the
lawyers
for
the
defence
and
were
frowned
upon
even
by
the
judge
who
presided
though
the
evidence
against
the
prisoner
was
conclusive
the
jury
without
shame
or
hesitation
acquitted
him
and
he
walked
out
of
court
amid
the
wildest
cheers
of
the
bystanders
similar
demonstrations
of
popular
sympathy
attended
the
trials
of
the
other
rioters
who
were
all
with
the
exception
of
a
young
boy
permitted
to
escape
the
penalty
of
their
gross
crimes
even
the
state
legislature
though
urged
to
do
so
by
many
of
the
leading
public
men
of
the
commonwealth
refused
to
vote
anything
like
an
adequate
sum
to
indemnify
the
nuns
and
pupils
for
their
losses
amounting
to
over
a
hundred
thousand
dollars
the
pitiful
sum
of
ten
thousand
dollars
was
offered
and
of
course
rejected
and
to
this
day
the
ruins
of
the
convent
stand
as
an
eloquent
monument
of
protestant
perfidy
and
puritanical
meanness
and
injustice
the
impunity
thus
legally
and
officially
guaranteed
to
mobs
and
sacrilegious

of

openly
insulted
by
their

on

and
actually
stoned
through
the

by
a

of
over
three
thousand
persons

there
were
no

be

the

of

up
in

with
no

rancor
and
audacity

created
by

was
put
together
by
some
contemptible
preacher
in
the
name
of
an
illiterate
girl
named
reed
who
the
better
to
mislead
the
public
assumed
the
title
of

earnestly
hope
and

said
the
preface
to
this
embodiment
of
falsehood
this
little
work
if
universally
diffused
will
do
more
by
its
unaffected
simplicity
in
deterring
protestant
parents
from
educating
their
daughters
in
catholic
nunneries
than
could
the
most
labored
and
learned
discourses
on
the
dangers
of
though
the
book
was
replete
with
stupid
fabrications
and
silly
blunders
so
grossly
had
the
popular
taste
been
perverted
that
fifty
thousand
copies
were
sold
within
a
year
after
its
publication
the
demand
was
still
increasing
when
another
contribution
to
protestant
literature
appeared
before
the
broad
disgusting
and
obscene
fabrications
of
which
the
mendacity
of
mary
paled
its
ineffectual
fires
this
latter
candidate
for
popular
favor
though
it
bore
the
name
destined
for
an
immortality
of
infamy
of
maria

a
notoriously
dissolute
woman
was
actually
compiled
by
a
few
needy
and
unscrupulous
adventurers
reverend
and
irreverend
who
found
a
distinguished
methodist
publishing
house
not
quite
so
needy
though
still
more
unscrupulous
to
publish
the
work
for
them
though
very
shame
compelled
even
them
to
withhold
their
names
from
the
publication
and
it
was
only
owing
to
a
legal
suit
arising
from
this
infamous
transaction
many
years
after
that
the
fact
was
revealed
that
the
publishers
of
this
vilest
of
assaults
on
one
of
the
holiest
institutions
of
the
catholic
church
was
the
firm
of
harper
brothers
true
to
their
character
they
saw
that
the
times
were
favorable
for
an
assault
on
catholicity
even
so
vile
as
this
one
and
true
to
their
nature
again
they
refused
to
their
wretched
accomplice
her
adequate
share
in
the
wages
of
sin
though
bearing
on
its
face
all
the
evidences
of
diabolical
malice
and
falsehood
condemned
by
the
better
portion
of
the
press
and
by
all
reputable
protestants
the
work
had
an
unparalleled
sale
for
some
time
the
demand
might
have
continued
to
go
on
increasing
indefinitely
but
in
an
evil
hour
for
the
speculators
its
authors
under
the
impression
that
the
prurient
taste
of
the
public
was
not
sufficiently
satiated
with
imaginary
horrors
issued
a
continuation
under
the
title
of
awful
this
composition
proved
an
efficient
antidote
to
the
malignant
poison
of
the
first
its
impurity
and
falsehoods
were
so
palpable
that
its
originators
were
glad
to
slink
into
obscurity
and
their
patrons
into
silence
followed
by
the
contempt
of
all
honest
men
just
ten
years
after
the
charlestown
outrage
the
spirit
of
protestant
persecution
began
to
revive
premonitory
symptoms
of
political
proscription
appeared
in
in
the
constitutional
conventions
of
rhode
island
and
louisiana
and
in
the
local
legislatures
of
other
states
but
it
was
not
till
the
early
part
of
that
it
became
evident
that
secret
measures
were
being
taken
to
arouse
the
dormant
feeling
of
antipathy
to
the
rights
of
catholics
so
rife
in
the
hearts
of
the
ignorant
protestant
masses
new
york
at
first
was
the
principal
seat
of
the
disorder
most
of
the
newspapers
of
that
period
teemed
with
eulogistic
reviews
of
books
written
against
the
faith
cheap
periodicals
such
as
the
rev
were
thrust
into
the
hands
of
all
who
would
read
them
by
the
agents
of
the
bible
and
proselytizing
societies
and
a
cohort
of
what
were
called
lecturers
of
which
a
reverend
individual
named
cheever
was
the
leader
was
employed
to
attack
the
catholic
church
with
every
conceivable
weapon
that
the
arsenal
of
protestantism
afforded
the
popular
mind
being
thus
prepared
for
a
change
the
various
elements
of
political
and
social
life
opposed
to
catholicity
were
crystallized
into
the
party
better
known
as
the
native
americans
on
the
of
march
the
new
faction
nominated
james
harper
for
mayor
of
the
city
of
new
york
and
about
the
same
time
william
rockwell
was
named
for
a
similar
office
in
brooklyn
the
platform
upon
which
these
gentlemen
stood
was
simple
but
comprehensive
the
retention
of
the
protestant
bible
and
protestant
books
in
the
public
schools
the
exclusion
of
catholics
of
all
nationalities
from
office
and
the
amendment
of
the
naturalization
laws
so
as
to
extend
the
probationary
term
of
citizenship
to
years
the
canvass
in
new
york
was
conducted
with
some
regard
to
decency
but
in
the
sister
city
the
nativists
threw
off
all
respect
for
law
their
processions
invaded
the
districts
inhabited
mainly
by
adopted
citizens
assailed
all
who
did
not
sympathize
with
them
and
riot
and
bloodshed
were
the
consequence
in
brooklyn
the
nativist
candidate
was
defeated
but
harper
was
elected
triumphantly
by
about
thousand
votes
the
ballots
that
placed
such
a
man
at
the
head
of
the
municipality
of
the
american
metropolis
were
deposited
by
both
whigs
and
democrats
though
each
party
had
a
candidate
in
the
field
the
former
contributed
upwards
of
fourteen
thousand
or
of
their
strength
their
opponents
somewhat
less
than
ten
thousand
but
the
action
of
the
city
politicians
was
quickly
repudiated
and
condemned
throughout
the
state
on
the
of
april
the
whigs
assembled
in
albany
and
passed
a
series
of
resolutions
denouncing
in
unequivocal
terms
the
tenets
of
the
native
americans
and
in
two
days
after
at
the
same
place
and
in
if
possible
a
more
forcible
manner
the
democracy
entered
their
protest
against
the
heresies
and
evil
tendencies
of
the
persecuting
faction
still
the
showed
such
signs
of
popular
strength
in
various
municipal
elections
that
year
that
the
lower
classes
of
politicians
of
all
shades
of
opinion
who
dared
not
openly
support
them
were
suspected
of
secretly
courting
their
friendship
the
nomination
of
frelinghuysen
with
henry
clay
at
the
whig
presidential
convention
of
may
was
well
understood
at
the
time
to
be
a
bid
for
nativist
support
and
eventually
defeated
the
distinguished
kentucky
orator
it
is
difficult
to
imagine
how
far
the
madness
of
the
hour
might
have
carried
ambitious
political
leaders
and
timid
conventions
had
not
the
scenes
of
sacrilege
and
murder
which
soon
after
disgraced
the
city
of
philadelphia
and
stained
its
streets
with
innocent
blood
sent
a
thrill
of
horror
throughout
the
entire
country
philadelphia
had
followed
if
not
anticipated
the
example
of
new
york
in
sowing
broadcast
the
seeds
of
civil
strife
early
in
the
year
secret
nativist
societies
were
formed
sensational
preachers
like
tyng
in
and
out
of
place
harangued
congregations
and
meetings
cheap
newspapers
were
started
for
the
sole
purpose
of
vilifying
catholics
and
working
upon
the
baser
passions
of
the
sectarian
population
of
the
country
the
motives
of
those
engineers
of
discord
were
the
same
as
those
of
their
new
york
brethren
and
their
method
of
attack
equally
treacherous
and
cowardly
one
of
the
principal
charges
against
their
catholic
was
that
they
were
hostile
to
free
schools
and
education
generally
to
this
unjust
aspersion
bishop
kenrick
on
the
of
march
publicly
replied
in
a
short
but
lucid
letter
in
which
he
said
have
not
asked
that
the
bible
be
excluded
from
the
public
schools
they
have
merely
desired
for
their
children
the
liberty
of
using
the
catholic
version
in
case
the
reading
of
the
bible
be
prescribed
by
the
controllers
or
directors
of
the
schools
they
only
desire
to
enjoy
the
benefit
of
the
constitution
of
the
state
of
pennsylvania
which
guarantees
the
rights
of
conscience
and
precludes
any
preference
of
sectarian
modes
of
worship
they
ask
that
the
school
laws
be
faithfully
executed
and
that
the
religious
predilections
of
the
parents
be
they
desire
that
the
public
schools
be
preserved
from
all
sectarian
influence
and
that
education
be
conducted
in
a
way
that
may
enable
all
citizens
equally
to
share
its
benefits
without
any
violence
being
offered
to
their
conscientious
so
deliberate
and
emphatic
a
denial
had
no
effect
on
the
wretched
men
who
tyrannized
over
the
second
city
in
the
union
except
that
it
was
resolved
to
substitute
brute
force
for
reason
and
to
precipitate
a
collision
with
their
comparatively
weak
victims
accordingly
on
the
of
may
a
nativist
meeting
was
held
in
kensington
the
design
of
the
managers
of
the
meeting
was
evidently
to
provoke
an
attack
for
finding
the
place
first
selected
for
the
gathering
unmolested
they
deliberately
moved
to
the
in
the
actual
presence
of
several
adopted
citizens
this
trick
and
the
insulting
speeches
that
followed
had
the
desired
effect
a
riot
took
place
several
shots
were
fired
on
both
sides
and
four
or
five
persons
were
more
or
less
seriously
wounded
the
nativists
retreated
and
made
an
unsuccessful
attempt
to
burn
a
nunnery
the
most
exaggerated
reports
of
this
affair
were
immediately
circulated
through
philadelphia
the
next
day
the
nativists
fully
armed
assembled
and
passed
a
series
of
resolutions
of
the
most
violent
character
preceded
by
an
american
flag
which
bore
an
inscription
as
malicious
as
it
was
untrue
they
attacked
the
hibernian
hose
company
destroyed
the
apparatus
and
broke
the
in
pieces
dwellings
were
burned
to
the
ground
their
hapless
occupants
mostly
women
and
children
fleeing
in
all
directions
amid
the
insults
and
shots
of
their
savage
assailants
the
citizens
were
now
thoroughly
aroused
the
military
under
cadwalader
was
called
out
and
bishop
kenrick
addressed
a
public
admonition
to
his
flock
to
preserve
peace
and
notwithstanding
the
provocation
to
exercise
forbearance
but
the
demon
of
fanaticism
once
let
loose
could
not
be
easily
laid
rioting
continued
throughout
the
day
and
far
into
the
night
early
on
wednesday
morning
church
the
female
seminary
attached
to
it
and
a
number
of
private
houses
in

were
ruthlessly
plundered
and
destroyed

burning
of
the

of

continued
to
shout
and
when
the
cross
at
the
peak
of
the
roof
fell
they
gave
three
cheers
and
a
drum
and
fife
played
the
the
burning
of
church
took
place
on
the
evening
of
the
same
day
this
building
one
of
the
finest
in
the
city
was
peculiarly
endeared
to
the
catholic
inhabitants
as
having
been
one
of
their
oldest
churches
in
philadelphia
many
of
the
contributors
to
its

were

of
historic
fame

as

and
girard
it
had
adjoining
it
extensive
and
a
commodious
parsonage
and
the
clock
in
its
tower
was
the
one
which
had
struck
the
first
tones
of
american
liberty
but
the
sacred
character
of
the
building
itself
and
the
patriotic
memories
which
surrounded
it
could
not
save
it
from
the
torch
of
the
philadelphia
mob

raging
with
the
greatest
fury
at
twenty
minutes
past
ten
the
cross
which
surmounted
the
steeple
and
which
remained
unhurt
fell
with
a
loud
crash
amid
the
plaudits
of
a
large
portion
of
the
a
very
valuable
library
and
several
splendid
paintings
shared
the
fate
of
the
church
but
bad
as
was
the
conduct
of
the
rioters
that
of
the
authorities
was
even
worse
the
militia
when
ordered
out
did
not
muster
for
several
hours
after
the
time
appointed
and
when
they
did
arrive
they
were
only
passive
if
not
gratified
spectators
of
the
lawless
scenes
before
them
when
was
threatened
the
pastor
rev
donohue
placed
it
under
the
charge
of
capt
fairlamb
giving
him
the
keys
yet
the
mob
was
allowed
to
wreak
its
vengeance
on
it
undisturbed
the
basement
of
was
occupied
by
some
armed
men
who
had
resolved
to
defend
it
at
all
hazards
but
on
the
assurance
of
mayor
scott
and
the
sheriff
that
they
had
troops
and
police
enough
to
protect
it
it
was
agreed
in
the
interests
of
peace
to
evacuate
it
this
had
scarcely
been
done
when
the
militia
and
civic
guard
fell
back
before
a
thousand
or
more
armed
ruffians
and
left
the
church
to
its
fate
for
nearly
sixty
hours
the
rioters
were
left
in
undisputed
possession
of
the
city
everything
the
catholics
held
sacred
was
violated
men
were
dragged
out
of
their
homes
and
brutally
maltreated
when
not
murdered
outright
the
houses
of
adopted
citizens
were
everywhere
plundered
an
immense
amount
of
property
was
destroyed
and
over
two
hundred
families
left
desolate
and
homeless
without
the
slightest
attempt
being
made
to
enforce
the
law
how
many
fell
victims
to
nativist
hate
and
rage
on
this
occasion
has
never
been
known
but
the
killed
and
wounded
were
counted
by
scores
an
attempt
to
outrival
philadelphia
in
atrocity
was
made
in
new
york
a
few
days
after
but
the
precautionary
steps
of
the
authorities
the
firm
attitude
assumed
by
the
late
archbishop
hughes
and
the
resolute
stand
taken
by
the
catholic
population
headed
by
eugene
casserly
who
was
at
that
time
editor
of
the
together
with
some
young
catholic
gentlemen
so
impressed
the
leaders
of
the
nativists
that
all
attempts
of
an
incendiary
nature
and
all
public
efforts
to
sympathize
with
the
philadelphia
mob
were
abandoned
nativism
staggered
under
the
blow
given
it
by
its
adherents
in
philadelphia
and
soon
sank
into
utter
insignificance
as
a
political
power
another
decade
however
passed
and
we
find
it
again
rejuvenated
this
time
it
assumed
the
name
of
the
party
and
extended
its
ramifications
through
every
state
in
the
union
its
declaration
of
principles
contained
sixteen
clauses
as
laid
down
by
its
organs
of
which
the
following
were
regarded
as
the
most
vital
the
repeal
of
all
naturalization
laws
none
but
native
americans
for
office
a
protestant
system
perpetual
war
on
opposition
to
the
formation
of
military
companies
composed
of
stringent
laws
against
immigration
ample
protection
to
protestant
interests
though
partly
directed
apparently
against
all
persons
of
foreign
birth
this
new
secret
society
was
actually
only
opposed
to
catholics
for
many
of
the
prominent
members
in
its
lodges
were
irish
orangemen
and
welsh
scotch
and
english
unnaturalized
adventurers
who
professed
no
form
of
belief
like
their
predecessors
of
the
employed
a
host
of
mendacious
ministers
and
subsidized
a
number
of
obscure
newspapers
to
circulate
their
slanders
against
catholics
native
as
well
as
adopted
citizens
but
they
also
added
a
new
feature
to
the
crusade
against
morality
and
civil
rights
this
was
a
device
for
creating
riots
and
bloodshed
for
provoking
quarrels
and
setting
neighbor
against
neighbor
worthy
the
fiend
of
darkness
himself
wretched
creatures
drawn
from
the
very
dregs
of
society
were
hired
to
travel
from
town
to
town
to
post
themselves
at
conspicuous
if
possible
before
catholic
churches
and
to
pour
forth
in
ribald
and
blasphemous
language
the
most
slanders
against
the
church
as
those
outcasts
generally
attracted
a
crowd
of
idle
persons
and
were
usually
sustained
by
the
presence
of
the
members
of
the
local
lodge
the
merest
interruption
of
their
foul
diatribes
was
the
signal
for
a
riot
ending
not
unfrequently
in
loss
of
life
or
limb
the
first
outrage
that
marked
the
career
of
the
of

the
attack
on
the
convent
of
mercy
providence
in
april
of
that
year
instigated
by
the
newspaper

of
a
notorious
criminal

then
figured
as

rowdy
elements
of
that
usually
quiet
city

convent

the
doors
and
windows
with
stones
to
the
great
alarm
of
the
ladies
and
pupils
within

would
doubtless
have
proceeded
to
extremities
were
it
not
that
the

fearing
a
repetition
of
the

rallied
for

of

up
to
that

for
ferocious
bigotry
for
two
days
august
and
riot
reigned
supreme
in
that
city
ten
persons
were
shot
down
in
the
streets
many
more
were
seriously
wounded
and
a
number
of
the
houses
of

were
wrecked

the

join
with
similar

in
marching
through
the
streets
of
that
city

happened
to
pass
the
german

being
in
a
sportive
mood
they
did
not
hesitate
to
attack
it
a
occurred
during
which
one
man
a
catholic
was
killed
and
several
were
seriously
injured
the
evidence
taken
by
the
jury
showed
that
the
admirers
of
king
william
were
well
armed
generally
intoxicated
and
that
the
assault
and
partial
destruction
of
the
church
were
altogether
wanton
and
unprovoked
early
in
the
same
month
news
was
received
of
a
succession
of
riots
in
new
orleans
the
victims
as
usual
being
catholics
but
the
spirit
of
terrorism
was
not
confined
to
one
section
or
particular
state
the
virus
of
bigotry
had
inoculated
the
whole
body
politic
in
october
people
of
all
shades
of
religious
opinion
were
astounded
to
hear
from
maine
that
the
rev
john
bapst
a
clergyman
of
exemplary
piety
and
mildness
had
actually
been
dragged
forcibly
from
the
house
of
a
friend
by
a
drunken
ellsworth
mob
ridden
on
a
rail
stripped
naked
tarred
and
feathered
and
left
for
dead
his
money
and

were
likewise
stolen
by
the
miscreants
father
crime
was
that
when
a
resident
of
ellsworth
some
time
previously
he
had
entered
into
a
controversy
about
public
schools
yet
in
the
face
of
all
these
lawless
proceedings
the
party
increased
with
amazing
rapidity

without
electioneering

the

no
prestige
or

it
has
completely
overthrown
and
swamped
the
two
old
historic
parties
of
the
this
was
certainly
true
of
new
england
and
notably
so
of
massachusetts
where
in
the
autumn
of
the
elected
their
candidate
for
governor

nearly
every
member
of
the
legislature
in

the
of
the
new

of
persecution
received
over
votes
and
though
defeated
in
the

it
was
more
than
suspected
that
the
democrat
who
was
chosen
as
mayor
had
been
a
member
of
the
organization
in
many
other
states
and
cities
the
power
of
the
sworn
secret
combination
was
felt
and
acknowledged
its
influence
and
unseen
grasp
on
the
passions
and
prejudices
of
the
lower
classes
of
protestants
were
plainly
perceptible
in
the
halls
of
congress
and
in
the
executive

in
the
senate
william
seward
was
the
first
and
foremost
to
denounce
the
american
party
as
early
as
july
in
a
speech
on
the
homestead
bill
he
took
occasion
to
remark
is
sufficient
for
me
to
say
that
in
my
judgment
everything
is
which
makes
a
distinction
of
whatever
kind
in
this
country
between
the
american
and
him
whose
lot
is
directed
to
be
cast
here
by
an
providence
and
who
renounces
his
allegiance
to
a
foreign
land
and
swears
fealty
to
the
country
which
adopts

example
of
the
great

followed
by
such
men
as
douglas

keitt
chandler
and
seymour
while
senators
dayton
and
houston
wilson
the
late
banks
and
a
number
of
other
politicians
championed
the
cause
of
intolerance
as
has
since
been
confessed
for
their
own
selfish
aggrandizement
as
much
as
from
inherent
littleness
of
soul

massachusetts
was
completely
controlled

his

discomfiture

justly
due

merit
of
having
first
convinced
the
american
people
that
the
american

was
actually
the
most
dangerous
enemy
of

and

appeared
on

but
so
far
behind
were
they
in
the
race
with
their
presidential
competitors
that
very
few
persons
cared
to
remember
the
paucity
of
their
votes
gradually
silently
but
steadily
like
vermin
from
a
sinking
ship
the
leaders
slunk
away
from
the
already
doomed
faction
and
by
a
hypocritical
display
of
zeal
endeavored
to
obtain
recognition
in
one
or
other
of
the
great
parties
but
generally
without
success
disappointed
ambition
impotent
rage
and
let
us
hope
remorse
of
conscience
occasionally
seized
upon
them
and
the
charity
of
silence
became
to
them
the
most
desired
of
blessings
perhaps
if
the
late
civil
war
had
not
occurred
to
swallow
in
the
immensity
of
its
operations
all
minor
interests
we
might
have
beheld
in
the
spectre
of
nativism
arising
from
its
uneasy
slumber
to
be
again
subjected
to
its
periodical
blights
and
curses
from
present
appearances
many
persons
apprehend
the
recurrence
in
this
year
of
the
wild
exhibitions
of
and
fanaticism
which
have
so
often
blotted
and
blurred
the
otherwise
stainless
pages
of
our
short
history
that
the
centennial
year
of
american
independence
and
republican
liberty
is
to
be
signalized
by
a
more
concerted
better
organized
and
more
ramified
attack
on
the
great
principles
of
civil
and
religious
freedom
which
underlie
and
sustain
the
fabric
of
our
government
we
trust
sincerely
hope
that
these
men
are
mistaken
but
if
such
is
to
be
the
case
if
we
catholics
are
doomed
once
more
to
be
subjected
to
the
abuse
of
the
vile
the
slander
of
the
hireling
and
the
violence
of
an
armed
mob
the
sooner
we
are
prepared
for
the
contingency
the
better
if
the
scenes
which
have
indelibly
disgraced
boston
and
philadelphia
ellsworth
and
louisville
are
to
be
again
rehearsed
by
the
sworn
secret
societies
whose
cabalistic
letters
disfigure
the
columns
of
so
many
of
our
newspapers
we
must
be
prepared
to
meet
the
danger
with
firmness
and
composure
as
catholics
demanding
nothing
but
what
is
justly
our
due
under
the
laws
our
position
will
ever
be
one
of
forbearance
charity
and
conciliation
but
as
american
citizens
proud
of
our
country
and
zealous
for
the
maintenance
of
her
institutions
our
place
shall
be
beside
the
executors
of
those
grand
enactments
which
have
made
this
republic
the
paragon
and
exemplar
of
all
civil
and
natural
virtues
no
matter
how
imminent
the
danger
or
how
great
the
sacrifice
in
lands
less
favored
catholic
rights
may
be
violated
by
prince
or
mob
with
impunity
but
we
would
be
unworthy
of
our
country
and
of
its
founders
were
we
to
shrink
for
a
moment
from
the
performance
of
our
trust

custodians
of

and

louise

before
the
belgian
royal
academy
of
medicine
i
how
is
the
name
of
louise
lateau
to
be
mentioned
without
immediately
calling
up
all
the
tumulta
which
that
name
has
provoked
books
of
science
and
philosophy
official
reports
academic
discourses
reports
of
visits
conferences
pamphlets
articles
in
journals
every
kind
of
literary
production
has
been
placed
under
contribution
to
keep
the
public
informed
about
the
of
bois
for
a
year
however
these
studies
have
betaken
themselves
to
a
region
that
might
be
called
exclusively
scientific
and
have
even
received
a
kind
of
official
consecration
from
the
recent
vote
of
the
royal
academy
of
medicine
it
may
be
of
service
to
the
reader
who
can
not
occupy
himself
with
special
studies
to
give
a
brief
exposition
of
the
affair
of
bois
in
itself
to
show
the
different
interpretations
of
it
that
have
been
attempted
and
to
indicate
clearly
the
actual
phase
of
the
question
from
a
scientific
point
of
view
as
early
as
about
the
middle
of
vague
rumors
were
heard
of
strange
events
which
were
taking
place
in
a
little
village
of
hainault
every
friday
a
young
girl
showed
on
the
different
portions
of
her
body
corresponding
to
the
wounds
of
our
saviour
jesus
christ
red
stains
from
which
blood
flowed
in
greater
or
less
abundance
it
was
also
said
that
on
every
friday
this
young
girl
ravished
in
ecstasy
remained
for
several
hours
completely
unconscious
of
all
that
was
passing
around
her
such
were
the
principal
facts
over
and
above
these
rumor
spread
the
story
of
certain
accessory
incidents
some
of
which
though
true
were
distorted
while
others
were
pure
fancy
thanks
to
the
daily
press
the
young
girl
soon
became
known
to
the
general
public
and
the
name
of
louise
lateau
passed
from
mouth
to
mouth
here
and
there
one
read
among
that
large
crowds
rushed
from
all
sides
from
belgium
and
from
without
to
assist
every
friday
at
the
scenes
which
were
being
enacted
in
the
chamber
at
bois
some
journals
profited
by
the
occasion
to
deliver
themselves
anew
of
declamations
against
superstitions
the
stupidity
of
the
masses
and
the
intriguing
character
of
the
while
even
many
men
of
good
faith
were
of
opinion
that
the
story
told
of
louise
lateau
might
indeed
be
true
but
ought
to
be
attributed
to
some
trickery
or
another
of
which
either
the
girl
or
her
family
was
culpable
happily
for
the
public
a
light
came
to
clear
up
this
chaos
of
versions
suppositions
and
diverse
and
contradictory
opinions
the
of
louvain
reproduced
by
instalments
beginning
in
a
study
by
lefebvre
on
these
extraordinary
events
some
time
after
this
study
appeared
in
the
form
of
a
volume
here
is
how
the
eminent
physician
expresses
himself
on
the
origin
of
his
study
story
told
by
the
first
witnesses
of
these
extraordinary
events
produced
a
lively
emotion
in
the
public
mind
and
soon
crowds
assembled
every
week
around
the
humble
house
which
was
their
theatre
the
ecclesiastical
authorities
took
up
the
facts
this
was
their
right
and
duty
from
the
very
beginning
they
recognized
that
the
different
elements
of
the
question
ought
to
pass
through
the
crucible
of
science
the
periodic
hemorrhage
and
the
suspension
of
the
exercise
of
the
senses
were
within
the
competence
of
physicians
i
was
asked
to
study
them
the
desire
being
expressed
that
the
examination
of
these
facts
should
be
of
the
most
thorough
description
and
that
they
should
not
be
allowed
to
escape
any
one
of
the
exigencies
and
severities
of
modern
i
deemed
it
right
therefore
to
accept
the
mission
which
was
offered
me
as
a
physician
i
was
only
asked
for
what
i
could
give
that
is
to
say
a
purely
medical
study
of
the
after
having
examined
the
events
of
bois
in
all
their
phases
after
having
put
to
the
proof
the
sincerity
of
the
young
girl
in
a
thousand
different
ways
and
by
means
of
a
variety
of
tests
the
eminent
louvain
professor
pronounced
the
facts
of
the
stigmatization
and
ecstasy
to
be
real
and
free
from
deception
passing
then
to
the
interpretation
of
the
events
themselves
the
author
thus
concludes
first
the
question
of
hemorrhage
i
have
demonstrated
that
the
periodic
bleedings
of
louise
lateau
belong
to
no
species
of
hemorrhage
admitted
in
the
regular
range
of
science
that
they
can
not
be
assimilated
to
any
of
the
extraordinary
cases
recorded
in
the
annals
of
medicine
that
in
fine
the
laws
of
physiology
do
not
afford
an
explanation
of
their
genesis
coming
next
to
the
question
of
ecstasy
i
have
carefully
gone
over
the
characters
of
the
standard
nervous
affections
which
could
offer
certain
traits
of
a
resemblance
however
remote
to
the
ecstasy
of
louise
lateau
and
i
believe
i
have
demonstrated
that
it
is
impossible
to
connect
it
with
any
of
the
nervous
affections
known
i
have
penetrated
the
domain
of
occult
sciences
those
dark
doctrines
have
furnished
us
with
no
more
data
for
an
interpretation
of
the
events
of
bois
than
the
free
sciences
which
expand
in
the
full
light
of
i
do
not
hesitate
to
say
that
the
appearance
of
this
book
was
a
veritable
event
and
that
it
marked
an
important
in
the
study
of
the
question
of
louise
lateau
by
those
who
knew
the
calm
and
reflective
spirit
of
lefebvre
and
the
independence
of
his
character
and
convictions
the
fact
of
the
real
existence
of
the
extraordinary
events
taking
place
at
bois
was
no
longer
called
in
question
and
if
some
doubt
still
remained
it
regarded
only
the
sense
in
which
those
events
were
to
be
interpreted
was
it
then
true
that
the
union
of
stigmata
and
ecstasies
belonged
to
no
known
malady
was
it
true
that
they
could
find
no
place
in
the
classification
of
diseases
under
a
new
title
with
physiological
proofs
to
accompany
them
notwithstanding
the
immense
credit
allowed
to
the
science
of
lefebvre
doubt
still
hovered
around
this
question
and
i
make
bold
to
say
in
the
honor
of
the
progress
of
science
that
such
doubt
was
legitimate
a
loyal
appeal
was
made
to
the
of
the
country
and
of
foreign
countries
urging
them
to
go
and
study
the
facts
at
bois
and
publish
their
opinion
soon
a
study
on
louise
lateau
made
by
a
french
physician
came
to
confirm
still
further
the
medical
study
of
lefebvre
then
a
german
virchow
seemed
to
accept
as
true
the
conclusions
of
the
belgian
doctor
by
that
famous
phrase
that
the
events
of
bois
must
be
considered
either
as
a
trick
or
as
a
miracle
meanwhile
certain
persons
seemed
still
reluctant
to
accept
facts
which
a
hundred
different
witnesses
affirmed
in
the
face
of
the
world
among
the
reluctant
are
to
be
ranked
first
of
all
those
who
are
of
bad
faith
with
whom
there
is
no
reason
to
trouble
others
who
for
philosophic
motives
seemed
to
accuse
the
witnesses
of
those
scenes
of
sacrificing
the
interest
of
science
to
that
of
their
religious
convictions
nevertheless
book
continued
to
make
headway
i
do
not
say
that
it
did
not
meet
with
some
attacks
here
and
there
and
certain
objections
in
detail
but
throughout
the
country
no
publication
of
any
pretension
to
seriousness
affected
either
to
deny
the
facts
or
to
give
a
natural
explanation
of
them
this
state
of
things
continued
up
to
july
at
this
epoch
charbonnier
a
physician
of
brussels
presented
to
the
belgian
royal
academy
of
medicine
a
work
entitled
et
facultés
diverses
des
mystiques
louise
boëns
on
his
part
submitted
to
the
same
learned
body
in
the
session
of
october
a
new
production
entitled
lateau
ou
les
mystères
de
bois
ii
the
events
of
bois
continued
to
occupy
public
attention
the
scenes
of
the
stigmatic
flows
of
blood
and
of
the
ecstasies
were
presented
every
friday
it
was
even
stated
that
from
the
middle
of
louise
lateau
had
taken
no
sort
of
nourishment
the
belgian
royal
academy
of
medicine
whether
because
it
dreaded
to
enter
upon
a
question
which
involved
beyond
the
scientific
side
a
side
purely
philosophic
or
whether
also
because
a
fitting
and
favorable
opportunity
of
taking
up
the
question
of
louise
lateau
was
not
presented
remained
mute
as
to
the
events
of
bois
the
almost
simultaneous
presentation
of
two
works
treating
on
the
very
subject
indicated
clearly
that
the
question
was
ripe
moreover
in
the
session
of
october
the
chief
medical
body
of
the
country
conformably
with
usage
appointed
a
special
committee
to
make
a
report
on
the
works
read
in
its
sessions
this
committee
consisted
of
mm
fossion
president
mascart
and
warlomont
colleagues
the
important
report
of
the
committee
was
read
in
the
session
of
the
of
february
by
warlomont
that
gentleman
to
show
how
the
study
of
work
necessitated
an
examination
into
the
affair
at
bois
said
the
committee
to
confine
itself
to
examining
the
memorial
placed
before
it
from
the
simple
point
of
view
of
its
absolute
scientific
value
without
occupying
itself
with
the
fact
which
gives
occasion
for
the
memorial
it
would
be
easier
to
do
so
perhaps
but
an
opportunity
would
thus
be
neglected
of
putting
the
academy
in
possession
of
an
actual
medical
observation
as
complete
as
possible
relative
to
a
fact
of
which
whether
we
like
it
or
not
the
discussion
can
no
longer
be
eluded
it
assumed
therefore
the
task
of
inquiring
into
the
affair
forthwith
resolved
however
arduous
might
be
the
mission
thus
undertaken
to
accept
it
without
regret
to
pursue
it
without
weakness
as
without
bias
and
to
set
before
the
society
such
elements
as
its
investigation
one
altogether
official
should
have
procured
this
is
the
trust
which
in
its
name
i
this
day
mm
charbonnier
and
boëns
were
the
first
in
our
country
who
undertook
to
find
fault
with
the
conclusions
of
book
and
to
explain
by
scientific
data
the
events
of
bois
boëns
almost
immediately
after
the
reading
of
a
portion
of
his
work
withdrew
it
and
was
able
by
this
means
to
escape
the
report
of
the
committee
was
this
disdain
for
the
judgment
of
his
on
the
part
of
the
distinguished
physician
of
charleroi
or
was
it
want
of
confidence
in
the
solidity
of
his
own
arguments
i
know
not
i
state
a
fact
and
continue
there
remained
then
for
the
committee
to
examine
the
work
of
charbonnier
this
memoir
is
voluminous
the
theory
of
the
author
is
substantially
as
follows
the
absence
of
aliment
and
the
concentration
of
the
faculties
of
the
soul
towards
one
object
have
been
the
primary
and
indispensable
conditions
of
ecstasies
and
stigmata
as
far
as
abstinence
is
concerned
it
is
perfectly
compatible
if
not
with
a
state
of
health
at
least
with
the
maintenance
of
life
question
of
abstinence
says
the
author
the
most
important
because
without
it
nothing
happens
it
being
well
explained
there
is
no
longer
anything
supernatural
in
any
of
the
physiological
and
pathological
phenomena
of
the
but
how
is
this
abstinence
compatible
with
life
by
the
law
of
the
substitution
of
functions
and
organs
organs
says
the
author
conjointly
associated
one
with
another
working
for
the
common
health
so
that
when
an
organ
for
one
cause
or
another
can
not
adequately
fulfil
its
functions
another
immediately
supplies
its
supposing
all
this
admitted
here
is
what
the
author
says
of
stigmatization
and
contemplation
are
the
causes
of
stigmatization
abstinence
in
suppressing
the
vegetative
functions
frees
both
the
nervous
influx
and
the
blood
which
were
distributed
among
the
digestive
organs
contemplation
gathers
together
the
contingent
of
pain
dispersed
through
all
the
body
to
fix
and
concentrate
it
on
certain
points
which
it
sees
admires
loves
in
jesus
christ
it
suppresses
all
the
functions
of
the
life
of
relation
to
devote
itself
exclusively
to
the
object
of
its
passion
the
bloody
flux
which
has
been
drawn
to
the
surface
of
the
skin
by
the
great
functional
activity
follows
to
the
end
the
nervous
influx
which
is
constantly
directed
towards
certain
points
and
the
stigmatization
is
of
the
ecstasy
according
to
charbonnier
is
the
principal
contemplation
the
secondary
we
can
not
indeed
enter
into
all
the
details
furnished
by
the
author
of
this
strange
theory
in
order
to
arrive
at
a
judgment
regarding
it
we
know
of
nothing
better
than
to
cite
the
conclusions
of
the
reader
of
the
report
on
the
work
itself
this
says
warlomont
a
whole
which
must
have
cost
the
author
long
and
laborious
research
as
far
as
the
inquiries
of
physiology
are
concerned
the
source
respectable
though
it
may
be
on
which
he
has
relied
must
be
a
cause
for
regret
his
principal
almost
his
only
authority
is
that
of
longet
who
is
now
many
years
dead
but
the
questions
relative
to
nutrition
those
precisely
which
are
at
stake
have
since
longet
been
placed
in
an
absolutely
new
light
the
work
which
we
have
just
analyzed
is
altogether
a
work
of
the
imagination
the
demonstration
of
the
thesis
which
the
author
has
set
up
he
has
pursued
by
every
means
clearing
out
of
his
road
the
obstacles
of
nature
which
embarrass
it
and
creating
at
will
new
functions
whereon
to
apply
his
organs
all
this
written
in
a
lively
imaginative
style
and
bearing
the
impress
of
conviction
there
is
only
one
thing
which
is
sadly
wanting
experimental
proof
a
few
simple
experiments
on
animals
logically
carried
out
would
have
informed
him
how
they
withstand
a
progressive
abstinence
and
what
changes
this
abstinence
effects
in
their
organs
and
functions
it
is
to
be
regretted
that
he
has
not
instituted
these
if
the
theory
advanced
by
charbonnier
based
on
such
doubtful
physiological
facts
finds
no
weight
with
the
learned
representative
of
the
academy
of
medicine
it
is
not
because
he
himself
admits
the
conclusions
arrived
at
in
the
study
of
lefebvre
on
louise
lateau
for
him
indeed
the
events
taking
place
at
bois
apart
from
the
question
of
fasting
which
has
not
been
positively
established
and
which
on
that
account
rightly
passes
beyond
scientific
discussion
are
exempt
from
all
fraud
and
deception
but
let
warlomont
himself
speak
having
analyzed
he
says
memoir
which
the
academy
has
confided
to
our
examination
and
having
refuted
it
principally
in
the
portions
which
concern
louise
lateau
it
remains
for
us
in
our
turn
to
give
our
own
ideas
relative
to
a
fact
of
such
interest
which
has
formed
the
subject
of
the
memoir
first
of
all
are
the
facts
cited
real
according
to
our
thinking
the
simulation
of
the
ecstasies
is
simply
impossible
accompanied
as
they
are
by
functional
troubles
the
provocation
for
which
would
pass
quite
beyond
the
empire
of
the
will
as
for
the
actual
spontaneity
of
the
stigmata
we
have
demonstrated
this
and
now
for
the
chief
part
of
the
report
it
is
that
in
which
the
learned
academician
attempts
to
give
a
physiological
explanation
of
the
facts
for
him
ecstasies
are
a
species
of
double
life
of
a
second
condition
such
as
may
be
presented
in
ordinary
and
extraordinary
nervous
states
as
well
as
in
others
in
consequence
of
material
injury
to
the
brain
during
the
existence
of
neurotic
disorders
under
the
influence
of
certain
special
appliances
magnetism
hypnotism
spontaneously
without
the
intervention
of
any
external
provocation
as
somnambulism
or
extraordinary
neurotic
affections
after
having
examined
each
of
these
points
in
detail
the
author
thus
continues
point
established
what
of
ecstasies
well
whatever
we
may
do
it
is
impossible
for
us
not
to
class
them
in
the
same
order
of
facts
not
to
see
in
them
the
influence
of
a
neurotic
perturbation
analogous
to
that
which
controls
neurotic
diseases
it
is
in
both
cases
the
passage
of
a
human
being
into
a
state
of
second
condition
characterized
by
the
suspension
more
or
less
complete
of
the
exercise
of
the
senses
with
a
special
concentration
of
all
the
cerebral
powers
towards
a
limited
object
among
the
ecstatics
as
among
the
hypnotics
there
prevails
a
perturbation
diminution
or
abolition
of
external
sensibility
all
is
concentrated
in
a
new
cerebral
functional
so
far
for
the
ecstasies
passing
next
to
the
production
of
stigmata
the
report
admits
in
principle
the
theory
of
alfred
maury
that
is
to
say
the
imagination
plays
the
principal
in
the
production
of
these
phenomena
but
to
meet
the
brilliant
member
of
the
institute
he
calls
to
his
aid
the
physiological
laws
and
most
recent
discoveries
in
order
to
show
how
the
imagination
can
by
the
irritation
of
certain
given
parts
provoke
a
veritable
congestion
of
those
parts
and
then
a
hemorrhage
virtue
of
what
mechanism
he
asks
blisters
first
produced
and
bleeding
afterwards
we
have
established
the
genesis
of
stigmatic
angiomata
the
attention
has
given
place
to
pain
and
pain
to
repeated
touchings
from
this
proceeds
the
congestion
which
has
brought
on
the
arrest
of
the
blood
in
the
capillaries
and
as
a
consequence
their
enlargement
then
comes
the
rush
of
blood
giving
place
to
congestive
motions
determined
by
a
hemorrhagic
diathesis
and
the
phenomena
disclose
themselves
in
all
their
simplicity
the
leucocytes
will
pass
across
the
capillaries
will
discharge
themselves
under
the
skin
and
the
blister
is
the
result
the
accumulation
of
blood
continuing
in
proportion
to
the
enlargement
of
the
capillaries
the
fleshly
tegument
will
end
by
bursting
then
the
blood
itself
whether
by
traversing
the
channels
created
by
the
previous
passage
of
the
leucocytes
or
by
the
rupture
of
the
vessels
the
likelihood
of
which
can
be
sustained
ends
by
an
external
eruption
and
the
hemorrhage
but
warlomont
goes
still
farther
he
says
that
not
only
are
stigmata
and
ecstasies
capable
of
explanation
when
taken
apart
from
one
another
but
that
by
their
union
they
constitute
what
in
pathology
is
called
aggregate
of
symptoms
according
to
this
stigmata
and
ecstasies
would
constitute
an
altogether
unique
morbid
state
to
which
the
professor
gives
the
following
name
and
definition
neuropathy
is
a
nervous
disease
having
its
seat
in
the
base
of
the
the
first
stage
of
which
consists
in
the
paralysis
of
the
centre
and
the
second
in
its
presented
in
this
way
the
report
of
the
distinguished
member
of
the
academy
was
not
only
a
report
but
a
veritable
original
work
thus
this
book
wherein
the
author
had
joined
loyalty
of
procedure
to
elegance
of
style
and
deep
erudition
produced
a
profound
sensation
the
theory
which
he
advances
might
well
leave
certain
doubts
with
the
reader
relative
to
the
solidity
of
the
bases
on
which
it
leans
but
by
its
method
it
exercised
a
real
fascination
on
the
mind
conclusions
were
as
far
as
the
interpretation
of
the
facts
went
diametrically
opposed
to
those
of
the
book
which
lefebvre
had
published
several
years
before
and
it
was
not
without
a
very
great
curiosity
that
the
public
awaited
the
reply
of
the
latter
the
reply
was
not
long
in
coming
discourse
occupied
so
to
say
exclusively
the
sessions
of
may
and
june
after
having
rendered
due
homage
to
the
courtesy
and
science
of
the
distinguished
reader
of
the
report
the
louvain
professor
hesitated
not
to
sustain
the
first
conclusions
advanced
in
his
book
and
to
demonstrate
the
small
foundation
of
the
theory
of
his
adversary
on
this
question
it
is
to
be
regretted
that
the
limits
at
my
disposal
do
not
allow
me
to
enter
into
all
the
physiological
details
and
pathological
considerations
on
which
lefebvre
builds
his
conclusions
i
regret
it
the
more
because
the
brilliant
words
of
the
orator
exercise
a
very
special
impression
by
the
clearness
of
their
exposition
the
logic
of
their
reasoning
and
the
exquisite
charm
which
they
give
to
even
the
driest
questions
first
as
to
the
stigmatic
hemorrhages
we
can
not
be
astonished
after
having
followed
the
proofs
which
the
learned
orator
gives
us
to
find
him
lay
down
the
following
conclusions
warlomont
is
driven
to
admit
a
single
centre
the
most
recent
researches
are
against
this
localization
the
centres
are
several
and
disseminated
the
distinguished
reader
of
the
report
constructs
his
doctrine
of
the
action
of
the
imagination
on
a
series
of
hypotheses
two
chief
ones
are
that
the
imagination
has
the
power
every
friday
morning
of
completely
paralyzing
the
centre
and
the
nerves
and
after
midday
by
a
contradictory
action
to
excite
violently
this
centre
and
consequently
to
close
up
the
pure
suppositions
which
have
not
only
not
been
demonstrated
by
the
author
but
which
seem
to
me
absolutely
even
admitting
these
hypotheses
as
well
founded
it
is
an
established
fact
that
the
complete
paralysis
of
the
centres
and
of
the
nerves
is
never
followed
by
bleeding
on
the
surface
of
the
skin
the
experience
of
all
physiologists
agrees
on
this
point
this
experience
proves
on
the
contrary
that
in
such
cases
there
are
sometimes
produced
suffusions
of
blood
in
the
mucous
membranes
such
suffusions
never
show
themselves
in
louise
lateau
a
series
of
hypotheses
still
more
complicated
than
those
laid
down
as
premises
by
the
distinguished
reader
of
the
report
might
be
conceded
to
wit
the
paralysis
of
the
arteries
and
the
simultaneous
constriction
of
the
veins
experiment
again
proves
that
even
under
these
conditions
bleeding
on
the
surface
of
the
skin
is
not
produced
warlomont
in
parting
from
the
hypotheses
which
i
have
just
combated
admits
that
the
bleeding
produced
by
the
influence
of
the
imagination
is
a
bleeding
by
transudation
but
the
characteristics
of
transudation
studied
in
the
light
of
modern
physiology
are
completely
opposed
to
those
of
the
stigmatic
bleeding
of
louise
lateau
finally
and
this
argument
alone
will
suffice
to
overthrow
the
thesis
of
the
distinguished
reader
of
the
report
clinical
observation
in
accordance
with
physiological
induction
proves
that
in
circumstances
where
the
imagination
exercises
its
greatest
violence
it
never
produces
bleeding
on
the
surface
of
the
regarding
ecstasies
the
orator
after
having
examined
the
different
states
with
which
the
reader
of
the
report
to
the
academy
compared
the
ecstasies
of
louise
lateau
concludes
by
saying
believe
i
have
demonstrated
that
the
analysis
of
second
conditions
brought
out
with
so
much
skill
by
the
distinguished
gentleman
does
not
give
the
key
to
the
ecstasy
of
louise
lateau
but
setting
aside
these
states
of
nervous
disease
should
not
the
imagination
be
made
to
bear
all
the
burden
of
the
ecstasy
as
it
does
of
the
stigmatization
after
examining
this
question
the
orator
concludes
in
the
negative
in
finishing
his
beautiful
discourse
he
says
honorable
colleague
in
studying
the
causes
of
the
stigmatization
and
ecstasy
has
given
to
them
a
physiological
interpretation
on
this
ground
i
have
separated
from
him
and
i
believe
i
have
demonstrated
that
that
interpretation
is
not
only
insufficient
but
also
erroneous
i
believed
for
a
moment
that
warlomont
was
about
to
offer
an
acceptable
scientific
theory
i
do
not
say
a
theory
complete
and
adequate
i
am
not
so
exacting
i
know
too
well
that
we
do
not
know
the
all
of
anything
if
our
eminent
colleague
had
proposed
to
us
a
physiological
interpretation
satisfying
the
most
moderate
demands
of
science
i
should
have
accepted
it
not
with
resignation
but
with
joy
and
eagerness
and
believe
me
gentlemen
my
religious
convictions
would
have
suffered
no
shock
thereby
learned
colleague
whom
you
have
charged
with
examining
the
events
of
bois
has
not
then
in
my
opinion
given
to
them
their
physiological
interpretation
other
physicians
have
attempted
the
same
task
i
name
two
of
them
because
their
works
have
been
produced
within
these
walls
of
all
boëns
in
withdrawing
his
memoir
from
the
order
of
the
day
of
the
academy
he
has
withdrawn
it
from
our
discussion
nevertheless
i
believe
i
am
not
severe
in
affirming
that
the
considerations
which
claimed
his
attention
and
the
irony
of
which
he
has
been
so
prodigal
in
my
own
regard
have
thrown
but
little
light
on
the
events
of
bois
charbonnier
has
submitted
to
your
appreciation
a
work
of
a
more
scientific
character
warlomont
has
examined
it
with
the
attention
which
it
deserves
and
has
refuted
it
i
am
thus
dispensed
from
returning
to
it
maintain
then
purely
and
simply
the
conclusions
of
my
study
the
stigmatization
and
the
ecstasies
of
louise
lateau
are
real
and
true
facts
and
science
has
not
furnished
their
physiological
crocq
spoke
after
lefebvre
like
warlomont
the
learned
brussels
professor
believes
that
the
interpretation
of
the
facts
positively
established
about
louise
lateau
belongs
to
pathological
physiology
the
theory
of
crocq
differs
but
little
from
that
of
warlomont
he
attaches
more
importance
to
abstinence
than
the
learned
reader
of
the
report
and
thus
comes
nearer
to
charbonnier
he
believes
also
that
the
bleeding
is
altogether
caused
by
a
rupture
of
the
capillaries
apart
from
these
small
distinctions
it
may
be
said
of
him
as
of
warlomont
that
he
is
of
opinion
that
the
imagination
by
its
influence
on
the
nervous
system
is
the
principal
cause
of
the
ecstasies
and
stigmata
here
are
the
rest
of
his
conclusions
the
state
of
louise
lateau
is
a
complex
pathological
state
characterized
by
the
following
facts
anæmia
and
weakness
of
constitution
arising
from
privations
endured
since
childhood
nervous
exaltation
produced
by
anæmia
and
directed
in
a
determined
sense
by
the
education
and
religious
tendencies
of
louise
ecstasies
constituting
the
supreme
degree
of
this
exaltation
bleeding
having
for
its
starting
point
anæmia
and
exaltation
of
the
nervous
system
relative
abstinence
considerably
exaggerated
by
the
sick
girl
conformably
to
what
is
observed
among
many
persons
who
suffer
from
nervous
disorders
this
state
offers
nothing
contrary
to
the
laws
of
pathological
physiology
it
is
consequently
useless
to
go
outside
of
that
in
search
of
explanation
it
has
the
same
characteristics
as
all
the
analogous
cases
related
by
physicians
and
historians
mysticism
altogether
save
cases
of
jugglery
and
mystification
ought
to
enter
into
the
province
of
pathology
which
is
vast
enough
to
contain
it
and
all
the
phenomena
explain
themselves
perfectly
by
taking
as
starting
point
the
principles
which
i
have
laid
if
we
had
to
advance
our
own
opinion
on
this
important
question
we
should
say
that
after
the
report
in
which
warlomont
had
treated
his
subject
with
so
much
method
and
science
there
remained
few
new
arguments
which
could
be
applied
to
the
physiological
theory
of
the
phenomena
of
mystics
it
should
be
considered
however
no
small
advantage
for
the
latter
physician
to
feel
himself
supported
by
crocq
who
had
brought
to
the
debates
the
weight
of
his
profound
erudition
and
vast
experience
iii
by
all
impartial
judges
the
case
might
be
regarded
as
understood
it
was
so
in
effect
the
different
orators
who
succeeded
each
other
in
the
tribune
of
the
academy
had
brought
to
their
respective
discourses
the
strongest
possible
array
of
facts
and
of
arguments
i
shall
astonish
no
one
then
by
saying
that
warlomont
could
not
allow
the
victorious
discourse
of
his
colleague
of
louvain
to
pass
without
some
observations
it
is
impossible
for
us
here
to
give
a
of
his
discourse
in
the
main
it
added
no
new
proof
to
the
substance
of
the
debate
and
confined
itself
to
the
criticism
of
certain
details
it
is
enough
for
us
to
say
that
in
this
discourse
the
learned
reader
of
the
report
to
the
academy
gave
new
proof
of
the
brilliancy
of
his
mind
and
the
adroitness
of
his
gifts
lefebvre
on
his
side
felt
himself
to
be
too
much
master
of
the
situation
to
need
emphasizing
his
triumph
any
further
this
is
what
he
did
in
the
session
of
october
without
precisely
entering
into
the
heart
of
the
debate
he
brought
out
more
strongly
certain
of
the
arguments
which
he
had
already
used
he
employed
them
to
refute
some
of
the
assertions
made
in
the
discourses
of
his
adversaries
held
up
certain
inaccuracies
and
concluded
as
he
had
the
right
to
do
by
the
following
words
which
give
an
exact
idea
of
the
state
of
the
question
us
resume
warlomont
has
studied
with
earnestness
and
candor
the
events
of
bois
he
has
stated
as
i
have
done
the
reality
of
the
stigmatization
and
ecstasy
he
has
demonstrated
as
i
have
that
these
phenomena
are
free
from
any
deception
crocq
after
having
examined
the
facts
on
the
spot
has
arrived
at
the
same
conclusions
the
learned
reader
of
the
report
has
built
up
a
scientific
theory
of
the
stigmatization
and
ecstasy
the
eminent
brussels
professor
has
in
his
turn
formulated
an
interpretation
very
nearly
approaching
to
that
of
warlomont
but
which
differs
from
it
nevertheless
on
certain
points
i
have
sought
on
my
side
a
physiological
explanation
of
these
extraordinary
facts
and
i
have
arrived
at
the
conclusion
that
science
could
furnish
no
satisfactory
interpretation
of
them
i
have
expounded
at
length
before
the
academy
the
reasons
which
prevent
me
from
accepting
the
theories
of
my
two
honorable
opponents
but
my
position
is
perfectly
correct
i
confine
myself
to
recognizing
my
powerlessness
to
interpret
the
facts
of
bois
warlomont
takes
another
attitude
he
pretends
that
we
have
a
scientific
explanation
of
these
phenomena
we
have
not
one
we
have
had
three
or
four
which
is
the
true
one
is
it
that
of
boëns
is
it
that
of
charbonnier
to
which
beyond
doubt
you
attach
some
importance
since
you
have
voted
that
it
be
printed
is
it
that
of
the
learned
reader
of
your
report
begin
by
choosing
as
for
me
i
hold
fast
to
my
first
conclusions
the
facts
of
bois
have
not
received
a
scientific
after
certain
remarks
made
at
the
same
session
by
mm
vleminckx
crocq
lefebvre
masoin
boëns
the
general
discussion
closed
the
printing
of
memoir
was
decided
on
and
a
vote
of
thanks
to
the
author
passed
with
this
should
have
ended
the
task
of
the
academy
and
those
who
had
hoped
for
a
physiological
interpretation
of
the
facts
of
bois
as
the
outcome
of
these
discussions
were
in
a
position
to
felicitate
themselves
on
the
result
for
by
its
absolute
silence
the
academy
allowed
a
certain
freedom
of
choice
but
during
the
session
of
july
which
a
family
affliction
prevented
lefebvre
from
assisting
at
two
members
proposed
orders
of
the
day
on
the
discussion
of
bois
nevertheless
by
a
very
proper
sentiment
which
the
distinguished
president
vleminckx
was
the
first
to
advance
those
orders
of
the
day
were
not
carried
at
that
date
that
of
kuborn
was
thus
conceived
academy
considering
the
phenomena
really
established
about
the
young
girl
of
bois
are
not
new
and
are
explicable
by
the
laws
of
pathological
physiology
the
prolonged
abstinence
which
has
been
argued
about
has
not
been
observed
by
the
committee
no
supervision
therefore
having
been
established
and
there
having
been
no
chance
of
establishing
it
the
proper
thing
was
not
to
pause
on
the
consideration
of
this
fact
but
to
consider
it
as
not
having
come
up
academy
follows
its
order
of
the
day
as
far
as
concerns
the
question
of
the
stigmatization
and
here
is
the
order
of
the
day
proposed
by
crocq
academy
considering
the
phenomena
established
about
louise
lateau
are
not
beyond
a
physiological
explanation
those
which
are
not
established
ought
no
longer
to
occupy
our
attention
the
discussion
closed
and
passes
to
the
order
of
the
the
same
resolutions
the
small
foundation
for
which
after
the
discourses
which
had
been
made
every
impartial
mind
ought
to
recognize
were
again
brought
up
in
the
session
of
october
vleminckx
having
induced
the
authors
of
the
orders
of
the
day
to
modify
their
wording
in
such
a
manner
as
to
render
them
acceptable
fossion
proposed
the
following
form
more
soothing
than
its
predecessors
royal
academy
of
medicine
declares
that
the
case
of
louise
lateau
has
not
been
completely
scrutinized
and
can
not
serve
as
a
base
for
serious
discussion
consequently
it
closes
the
laussedat
after
some
preliminary
remarks
finally
proposed
the
order
of
the
day
pure
and
simple
which
was
adopted
the
bearing
of
this
vote
will
escape
the
mind
of
no
one
in
setting
aside
the
orders
of
the
day
which
pretended
that
what
had
been
positively
established
in
the
question
of
bois
might
be
solved
by
science
the
academy
has
fully
confirmed
the
conclusions
of
book
meanwhile
in
ending
let
us
return
to
bois
to
that
young
girl
who
has
become
more
than
ever
the
object
of
the
veneration
of
some
the
study
of
others
and
the
wonder
of
all
since
louise
lateau
presents
the
phenomena
weekly
of
the
bloody
stigmata
and
the
ecstasies
to
which
later
on
was
added
abstinence
from
food
her
first
and
chief
historian
lefebvre
after
having
watched
the
young
girl
affirms
since
she
whom
a
certain
portion
of
the
public
considers
as
a
cheat
or
an
invalid
really
presents
the
phenomena
which
are
reported
of
her
these
phenomena
are
exempt
from
trickery
and
it
is
impossible
to
explain
them
by
the
laws
of
physiology
and
pathology
we
omit
the
question
of
fasting
which
remains
to
be
studied
seven
years
after
the
appearance
of
the
first
phenomena
at
the
time
when
the
commotion
which
they
produced
had
so
to
say
reached
its
height
the
leading
learned
body
in
belgium
examined
the
mysterious
scenes
in
the
humble
house
of
bois
and
through
mm
crocq
and
warlomont
made
an
inquiry
into
the
reality
and
sincerity
of
the
facts
and
brings
in
a
verdict
that
the
facts
are
real
and
free
from
all
fraud
finally
this
same
belgian
royal
academy
of
medicine
by
its
vote
avows
in
the
face
of
the
world
that
if
it
ought
not
to
recognize
a
supernatural
cause
in
the
facts
about
louise
lateau
as
little
can
it
demonstrate
their
natural
origin
and
physiological
genesis
such
is
the
actual
state
of
this
extraordinary

advanced
to

at

the
who

he
daily
attended

services
sometimes
at
the
and
sometimes
at
the
parish

he
always
dined
in
public
at
the
château
of
lohobiague
surrounded
by
crowds
eager
to
witness
the
process
of
royal
mastication
in
the
afternoon
there
were
performances
by
comedians
who
had
followed
the
court
from
paris
and
sometimes
spanish
mysteries
to
which
queen
anne
was
partial
were
represented
in
which
the
actors
were
dressed
as
hermits
and
nuns
and
sacred
events
were
depicted
to
the
downright
scandal
of
the
great
mademoiselle
the
day
ended
with
a
ball
in
which
the
king
did
not
disdain
to
display
the
superior
graces
of
his
royal
person
in
a
everything
in
short
was
quite
in
the
style
of
the
itself
the
marriage
which
had
taken
place
at
fontarabia
by
procuration
was
personally
solemnized
in
the
parish
church
of
jean
de
luz
by
the
bishop
of
bayonne
in
the
presence
of
an
attentive
crowd
the
door
by
which
the
royal
couple
entered
was
afterwards
walled
up
that
it
might
never
serve
for
any
one
else
a
not
uncommon
mark
of
respect
in
those
days
a
shop
now
stands
against
this
porta
regia
the
king
presented
the
church
on
this
occasion
with
a
complete
set
of
sacred
vessels
and
ecclesiastical
vestments
the
church
in
which
louis
xiv
was
married
is
exteriorly
a
noble
building
with
an
octagonal
tower
but
of
no
architectural
merit
within
there
are
no
side
aisles
but
around
the
nave
are
ranges
of
galleries
peculiar
to
the
basque
churches
where
the
separation
of
the
men
from
the
women
is
still
rigorously
maintained
the
only
piece
of
sculpture
is
a
strange
in
which
the
virgin
veiled
in
a
large
cope
holds
the
dead
christ
on
her
knees
a
rather
diminutive
angel
in
a
flowing
robe
with
pointed
sleeves
of
the
time
of
charles
bears
a
scroll
the
inscription
of
which
has
become
illegible
behind
the
organ
in
the
obscurity
of
the
lower
gallery
of
the
church
hangs
a
dark
wooden
frame
short
but
broad
with
white
corners
which
contains
a
curious
painting
of
the
xviith
century
representing
christ
before
pilate
it
is
by
no
means
remarkable
as
a
work
of
art
for
it
is
deficient
in
perspective
there
is
no
grace
in
the
drapery
no
special
excellence
of
coloring
the
figures
are
generally
drawn
with
correctness
but
the
faces
seem
rather
taken
from
pictures
than
from
real
life
but
however
poor
the
execution
this
painting
merits
attention
on
account
of
its
dramatic
character
the
composition
represents
persons
at
the
left
is
pontius
pilate
governor
of
judea
seated
in
a
large
beneath
a
canopy
pointing
with
his
left
hand
towards
the
saviour
before
him
in
his
right
hand
he
holds
a
kind
of
sceptre
his
beard
is
trimmed
in
the
style
of
henri
quatre
he
wears
a
large
mantle
lined
with
ermine
and
on
his
head
a
such
as
the
old
presidents
of
parliament
used
to
wear
in
france
below
pilate
is
the
clerk
recording
the
votes
in
a
large
register
and
before
him
is
the
urn
in
which
they
are
deposited
in
front
of
the
clerk
but
separated
from
him
by
a
long
white
scroll
on
which
is
inscribed
the
sentence
pronounced
by
pilate
is
seated
our
saviour
his
loins
girded
with
a
strip
of
scarlet
cloth
his
bowed
head
encircled
by
luminous
rays
his
attitude
expressive
of
humility
and
submission
his
bound
hands
extended
on
his
knees
in
the
centre
of
the
canvas
above
this
group
is
the
caiaphas
standing
under
an
arch
his
head
thrown
back
and
his
hands
extended
in
an
imposing
attitude
he
wears
a
cap
something
like
a
mitre
a
kind
of
stole
is
crossed
on
his
breast
his
long
robe
is
adorned
with
three
flounces
of
lace
his
face
is
that
of
a
young
man
the
slight
black
mustache
he
wears
is
turned
up
in
a
way
that
gives
him
a
resemblance
to
louis
xiii
it
is
evidently
a
portrait
of
that
age
at
the
side
of
pilate
and
behind
christ
are
ranged
the
members
of
the
jewish
sanhedrim
standing
or
sitting
in
various
postures
with
white
scrolls
in
their
hands
which
they
hold
like
screens
bearing
their
names
and
the
expression
of
their
sentiments
respecting
the
divine
victim
their
dress
is
black
or
white
but
varied
in
form
most
of
them
wear
a
or
ermine
cape
and
the
collar
of
some
order
of
knighthood
as
of
michael
and
the
esprit
they
are
all
young
have
mustaches
and
look
as
if
they
belonged
to
the
time
of
louis
treize
on
their
heads
are
turbans
or
through
the
open
window
at
the
end
of
the
pretorium
may
be
seen
the
mob
armed
with
spears
and
expressing
its
sentiments
by
means
of
a
scroll
at
the
side
of
the
window
thou
let
this
man
go
thou
art
not

crucify
him
crucify
him
his
blood
be
on
us
and
on
our
the
chief
interest
of
the
picture
centres
in
these
inscriptions
which
are
in
queer
old
french
of
marvellous
orthography
at
the
bottom
of
the
painting

it
is
a
shameful
thing

detestable
there
be

how
can

ye

that

that
the

perish

crucify

his

on
the
large

the
sentence
of

judge
in

thrice
powerful
emperor

accused
before
me
that
being
born
of
father

and
base
extraction

made
himself
by
lofty
and
blasphemous
words
the

and
examined
the
case

say
and
declare
on
my
conscience
he
shall
be
crucified
between

this
picture
is
analogous
to
the
old
mysteries
of
the
passion
once
so
popular
in
this
region
in
which
the
author
who
respected
the
meaning
of
the
sacred
text
was
at
liberty
to
draw
freely
on
his
imagination
it
was
especially
in
the
dialogue
that
lay
the
field
for
his
genius
however
naïve
these
sacred
dramas
they
greatly
pleased
the
people
a
painting
similar
to
this
formerly
existed
in
church
at
paris
in
which
figured
the
undecided
pilate
in
judicial
array
caiaphas
the
complacent
flatterer
of
the
people
and
the
mob
with
its
old
of
him
crucify
him
we
must
not
forget
a
work
of
art
of
very
different
character
associated
with
the
history
of
jean
de
luz
it
is
a
curious
piece
of
commemorating
the
conferences
of
the
two
great
statesmen
cardinal
mazarin
and
don
luis
de
haro
and
evidently
designed
by
an
able
artist
perhaps
by
velasquez
himself
it
is
a
kind
of
it
would
never
do
to
call
it
by
the
ignoble
name
of
coverlet
of
linen
of
remarkable
fineness
on
which
are
embroidered
in
purple
silk
the
eminent
personages
connected
with
the
treaty
of
the
pyrenees
as
well
as
various
allegorical
figures
and
accessory
ornaments
which
make
it
a
genuine
historic
picture
of
lively
and
interesting
character
this
delicate
piece
of
spanish
was
wrought
by
the
order
of
don
luis
de
haro
as
a
mark
of
homage
to
his
royal
master
he
presented
it
to
the
king
on
his
may
and
it
probably
adorned
the
royal
couch
but
the
better
to
comprehend
this
work
of
art
for
such
it
is
in
spite
of
its
name
let
us
recall
briefly
the
events
that
suggested
its
details
philip
iv
ascended
the
spanish
throne
in
when
barely
sixteen
years
of
age
his
reign
lasted
till
he
had
successively
two
ministers
of
state
both
of
great
ability
but
of
very
different
political
views
in
the
first
part
of
his
reign
the
young
monarch
gave
his
whole
confidence
to
the
count
of
olivares
whose
authority
was
almost
absolute
till
but
his
ministry
was
far
from
fortunate
on
the
contrary
it
brought
such
humiliating
calamities
on
the
country
that
the
king
at
length
awoke
to
the
danger
that
menaced
it
he
dismissed
olivares
and
appointed
the
nephew
and
heir
in
his
place
who
proved
one
of
the
ablest
ministers
ever
known
in
spain
he
was
a
descendant
of
the
brave
castilian
lord
to
whom
alfonso
vii
was
indebted
for
the
capture
of
zurita
but
who
would
accept
no
reward
from
the
grateful
prince
but
the
privilege
of
giving
the
name
of
haro
to
a
town
he
had
built
it
was
another
descendant
of
this
proud
warrior
who
was
made
archbishop
of
mexico
in
the
latter
part
of
the
xviiith
century
and
was
so
remarkable
for
his
charity
and
eloquence
as
a
preacher
don
luis
not
only
had
the
military
genius
of
his
ancestor
but
the
prudence
of
a
real
statesman
and
he
succeeded
in
partially
repairing
the
disasters
of
the
preceding
ministry
he
raised
an
army
and
equipped
a
powerful
squadron
by
which
he
repulsed
the
french
checked
the
portuguese
brought
the
rebellious
provinces
into
subjection
and
effected
the
treaty
of
munster
which
energetic
measures
produced
such
an
effect
on
the
french
government
as
to
lead
to
amicable
relations
between
the
two
great
ministers
who
at
this
time
held
the
destiny
of
europe
in
their
hands
and
to
bring
about
a
general
peace
in
it
was
with
this
object
cardinal
mazarin
and
don
luis
de
haro
agreed
upon
a
meeting
on
the
des
as
the
isle
of
conference
was
then
called
which
led
to
the
treaty
of
the
pyrenees
as
a
reward
for
don
signal
services
particularly
the
peace
he
had
cemented
by
an
alliance
so
honorable
to
the
nation
philip
in
the
following
year
conferred
on
him
the
title
of
duke
and
gave
him
the
surname
la
it
was
at
this
time
don
luis
had
this
curious
wrought
as
a
present
to
the
king
he
was
the
declared
patron
of
the
fine
arts
and
had
established
weekly
reunions
to
bring
together
the
principal
artists
of
spain
some
of
whom
probably
designed
this
memorial
of
his
glory
it
was
preserved
with
evident
care
and
handed
down
from
one
sovereign
to
another
till
it
finally
fell
into
the
possession
of
the
mother
of
ferdinand
who
wishing
to
express
her
sense
of
the
fidelity
of
one
of
her
ladies
of
honor
gave
her
this
valuable
counterpane
in
this
way
it
passed
into
the
hands
of
its
present
owner
at
bayonne
on
the
upper
part
of
this
covering
the
power
of
spain
is
represented
by
a
woman
holding
a
subdued
lion
at
her
feet
in
the
centre
are
nuestra
señora
del
pilar
and
ferdinand
patrons
of
the
kingdom
around
whom
are
the
eagles
of
austria
so
closely
allied
to
spain
and
by
way
of
allusion
to
the
des
where
the
recent
negotiations
had
taken
place
pheasants
are
to
be
seen
in
every
direction
cardinal
mazarin
and
don
luis
de
haro
are
more
than
once
represented
in
one
place
they
are
presenting
an
olive
branch
to
the
powers
they
serve
in
another
they
are
advancing
side
by
side
towards
philip
to
solicit
the
hand
of
his
daughter
for
louis
xiv
here
philip
gives
his
consent
to
the
marriage
and
lower
down
louis
receives
his
bride
in
the
presence
of
two
females
who
personify
france
and
spain
the
intermediate
spaces
are
filled
up
with
allusions
to
commerce
with
foreign
lands
and
the
progress
of
civilization
at
home
not
only
war
victory
and
politics
have
their
emblems
but
literature
beneficence
and
wealth
but
there
are
many
symbols
the
meaning
of
which
it
would
require
the
sagacity
of
a
champollion
to
fathom
this
is
perhaps
the
only
known
instance
of
a
prime
minister
directing
his
energies
to
the
fabrication
of
a
counterpane
disraeli
to
be
sure
has
woven
many
an
extravagant
web
of
romance
with
oriental
profusion
of
ornament
but
not
to
our
knowledge
in
purple
and
fine
linen
like
don
luis
de
haro
we
have
seen
one
of
the
gorgeous
coverlets
of
louis
but
it
was
wrought
by
the
young
ladies
of
cyr
under
the
direction
of
mme
de
maintenon
and
there
is
another
in
the
hôtel
de
cluny
that
once
belonged
to
francis
i
the
of
don
luis
de
haro
the
sole
heiress
of
the
house
married
the
duke
of
alba
carrying
with
her
as
a
dowry
the
vast
possessions
of
olivares
guzman
and
del
carpio
the
of
the
eugénie
is
a
direct
descendant
of
theirs
opposite
jean
de
luz
on
the
other
side
of
the
nivelle
is
cibourre
with
its
solemn
mysterious
church
and
its
widowed
houses
built
along
the
quay
and
straggling
up
the
hill
of
bordagain
prosperous
once
like
its
neighbor
it
also
participated
in
its
misfortunes
and
now
wears
the
same
touching
air
of
melancholy
the
men
are
all
sailors
the
best
sailors
in
europe
but
they
are
absent
a
great
part
of
the
year
fearless
wreckers
live
along
the
shore
who
brave
the
greatest
dangers
to
aid
ships
in
distress
in
more
prosperous
days
its
rivalry
with
jean
de
luz
often
led
to
quarrels
and
the
islet
which
connects
the
two
places
was
frequently
covered
with
the
blood
shed
in
these
encounters
the
convent
of
recollects
now
a
which
we
pass
on
our
way
to
cibourre
was
founded
in
expiation
of
this
mutual
hatred
and
very
appropriately
dedicated
to
dame
de
la
our
lady
of
peace
the
cloister
with
its
round
arches
is
still
in
good
preservation
and
the
cistern
is
to
be
seen
in
the
court
constructed
by
cardinal
mazarin
that
the
friars
might
have
a
supply
of
soft
water
the
basques
are
famed
for
their
truthfulness
and
honesty
the
result
perhaps
of
the
severity
of
their
ancient
laws
one
of
which
ordered
a
tooth
to
be
extracted
every
time
a
person
was
convicted
of
lying
no
wonder
the
love
of
truth
took
such
deep
among
them
but
had
this
stringent
law
been
handed
down
and
extended
to
other
lands
what
toothless
communities
there
would
now
be
in
the
world
the
eternal
years
by
the
author
of
divine
ii
the
pulsations
of
time
the
deduction
we
arrive
at
from
the
argument
which
we
have
laid
down
is
that
the
history
of
the
world
is
a
consistent
one
and
not
a
series
of
loose
incidents
strung
together
it
is
as
much
this
morally
it
is
as
truly
the
evolution
and
unwinding
of
a
high
moral
law
and
of
a
great
spiritual
truth
as
the
life
of
the
plant
from
the
seed
to
the
ripe
fruit
is
the
development
of
a
natural
growth
this
last
is
governed
by
laws
with
which
we
are
only
partially
acquainted
whereas
the
moral
law
and
the
spiritual
truth
are
revealed
to
us
by
the
divine
scheme
of
creation
and
redemption
there
is
nothing
existing
either
in
the
natural
or
in
the
spiritual
law
and
especially
in
this
last
which
is
not
more
or
less
in
one
way
or
in
another
by
assertion
or
by
negation
a
revelation
of
the
divine
being
he
reveals
himself
directly
by
his
volitions
and
indirectly
by
his
permissions
and
we
can
only
be
one
with
him
when
we
have
learnt
to
accept
both
and
to
submit
to
both
not
in
the
spirit
of
quietism
or
fatalism
but
as
actively
entering
into
his
intentions
accepting
what
he
wills
and
bearing
what
he
permits
there
is
no
harmony
possible
between
the
soul
and
god
until
we
have
arrived
at
this
and
the
history
of
the
world
is
the
history
of
acquiescence
in
or
resistance
to
the
supreme
will
of
god
the
first
disruption
of
the
will
of
man
from
the
will
of
god
in
the
fall
of
man
wove
a
dark
woof
into
the
web
of
time
and
every
act
of
ours
which
is
not
according
to
the
will
of
god
weaves
the
same
into
our
own
lives
because
it
is
a
rupture
of
the
law
of
harmony
which
god
has
instituted
between
himself
as
creator
and
us
as
creatures
were
that
harmony
unbroken
man
would
rest
in
god
as
in
his
centre
for
being
finite
he
has
no
sufficiency
in
himself
but
for
ever
seeks
some
good
extrinsic
to
himself
the
same
applies
to
all
creation
whose
ultimate
end
and
highest
good
must
always
be
some
object
beyond
and
above
itself
and
that
object
is
none
other
than
god
ignorantes
colitis
the
finite
striving
after
the
infinite
thus
the
whole
divine
government
of
the
world
is
a
gradual
unfolding
of
the
divine
will
according
as
we
are
able
to
receive
it
and
the
degree
of
receptivity
in
mankind
at
various
periods
of
the
history
and
in
different
localities
accounts
for
the
variety
in
the
divine
dispensations
and
for
the
imperfection
of
some
as
compared
with
others
the
more
excellent
could
not
be
received
by
all
at
all
times
the
promise
was
given
to
abraham
but
four
hundred
and
thirty
years
elapsed
before
its
fulfilment
for
the
express
purpose
of
being
occupied
and
spent
in
the
institution
of
the
law
as
a
less
perfect
dispensation
and
which
was
given
because
of
transgressions
transgressiones
posita
thus
showing
the
adaptive
government
of
god
the
gradual
building
up
of
the
city
of
the
lord
whose
stones
are
the
living
souls
of
men
which
are
and
made
ready
but
so
that
there
shall
be
hammer
nor
axe
nor
tool
of
iron
while
it
is
building
for
god
does
not
force
his
creature
he
pours
not
wine
into
old
bottles
but
waits
in
patience
the
growth
of
his
poor
creatures
and
the
slow
and
gradual
leavening
of
the
great
mass
a
time
had
been
when
god
walked
with
man
the
afternoon
and
whatever
may
be
the
full
meaning
of
this
intercourse
at
least
it
must
have
been
intimate
and
tender
but
when
the
black
pall
of
evil
fell
on
the
face
of
creation
the
light
of
intercourse
with
man
was
let
in
by
slow
degrees
like
single
stars
coming
out
in
the
dark
firmament
the
revelations
like
the
stars
varied
in
magnitude
and
glory
lay
wide
apart
from
each
other
rose
at
different
intervals
of
longer
or
shorter
duration
and
conveyed
like
them
a
flickering
and
uncertain
light
until
the
of
justice
arose
with
health
in
his
wings
and
the
rear
of
darkness
the
degree
of
light
vouchsafed
was
limited
by
the
capacity
of
the
recipient
and
that
capacity
has
not
always
been
the
same
in
all
ages
any
more
than
in
any
one
age
it
is
the
same
in
all
the
contemporary
men
or
in
each
man
the
same
at
all
periods
of
his
life
it
is
thus
that
we
arrive
at
the
explanation
of
an
apparent
difference
of
tone
color
and
texture
so
to
speak
in
the
various
manifestations
of
god
to
man
the
manifestation
is
limited
to
the
capacity
of
the
recipient
and
not
only
is
it
limited
but
to
a
certain
extent
it
becomes
as
it
were
tinged
by
the
properties
of
the
medium
through
which
it
is
transmitted
to
others
it
assumes
characteristics
that
are
not
essentially
its
own
for
so
marvellous
is
the
respect
with
which
the
creator
treats
the
freedom
of
his
creature
that
he
suffers
us
to
give
a
measure
of
our
own
color
to
what
he
reveals
to
us
so
that
it
may
be
more
our
own
more
on
our
level
more
within
our
grasp
as
though
he
poured
the
white
waters
of
saving
truth
into
glasses
of
varied
colors
and
thus
hid
from
us
a
pellucidity
too
perfect
for
our
nature
and
thus
it
happens
that
to
us
who
dwell
in
the
light
of
church
with
the
seven
lamps
of
the
seven
sacraments
burning
in
the
sanctuary
the
god
of
abraham
and
of
isaac
and
of
jacob
hardly
seems
to
us
the
same
god
as
our
god
we
see
him
through
the
prism
of
the
past
amid
surroundings
that
are
strange
to
us
in
the
old
patriarchal
life
that
seems
so
impossible
a
mode
of
existence
to
the
denizens
of
great
cities
in
modern
europe
this
is
equally
true
throughout
the
history
of
the
world
it
is
also
true
of
every
individual
soul
and
it
is
true
of
the
same
soul
at
different
periods
of
its
existence
he
is
the
same
god
always
and
everywhere
but
there
is
a
difference
in
the
kind
of
reception
which
each
soul
gives
to
that
portion
of
divine
knowledge
and
grace
which
it
is
capable
of
receiving
and
which
it
actually
does
receive
for
they
are
kinds
of
vessels
every
little
vessel
from
the
vessels
of
cups
even
to
every
instrument
of
they
differ
in
capacity
and
they
differ
in
material
and
the
great
god
in
revealing
himself
does
so
by
degrees
he
has
deposited
as
it
were
the
whole
treasure
of
himself
in
the
bosom
of
his
spouse
the
church
but
the
births
of
new
grace
and
further
developed
truth
only
come
to
us
as
we
can
bear
them
and
when
we
can
bear
them
the
body
of
truth
is
all
there
but
the
dispensing
of
that
truth
varies
in
degree
as
time
goes
on
god
governs
in
his
own
world
but
he
does
so
behind
and
through
the
human
instruments
whom
he
condescends
to
employ
and
as
in
the
exercise
of
his
own
man
chose
the
evil
and
refused
the
good
so
has
the
almighty
accommodated
himself
to
the
conditions
which
man
has
instituted
were
he
to
do
otherwise
he
would
force
the
will
of
his
creature
which
he
never
will
do
because
the
doing
it
would
have
for
result
to
deprive
that
creature
of
all
moral
status
and
reduce
him
to
a
machine
from
the
moment
that
we
lose
the
power
of
refusing
the
good
and
taking
the
evil
from
the
moment
that
any
force
really
superior
to
that
which
has
been
put
into
the
arsenals
of
our
own
being
robs
us
of
the
faculty
of
selection
we
lose
all
merit
and
consequently
all
demerit
the
creator
when
he
made
man
surrounded
him
with
the
respect
due
to
a
being
who
had
the
power
of
disposing
of
his
own
everlasting
destiny
nor
has
he
ever
done
nor
will
he
do
anything
which
can
entrench
on
this
prerogative
the
whole
system
of
grace
is
a
system
divinely
devised
to
afford
man
aid
in
the
selection
he
has
to
make
there
lies
an
atmosphere
of
grace
all
around
our
souls
as
there
lies
the
air
we
breathe
around
our
senses
the
one
is
as
frequently
unperceived
by
us
as
the
other
we
are
without
consciousness
as
regards
its
presence
as
we
are
without
direct
habitual
consciousness
of
the
act
of
breathing
and
of
our
own
existence
except
as
from
time
to
time
we
make
a
reflective
modification
in
our
own
mind
of
the
idea
of
the
air
and
of
the
fact
of
our
inhaling
it
we
are
unconscious
that
it
is
the
divine
creator
who
is
for
ever
sustaining
our
physical
existence
we
are
oblivious
of
it
for
hours
together
unless
we
stop
and
think
it
is
the
same
with
the
presence
of
grace
and
though
grace
as
theology
calls
it
begins
with
the
illustration
of
the
intellect
it
does
not
follow
that
we
are
always
by
any
means
conscious
of
this
illustration
it
is
needless
to
carry
out
the
theological
statement
in
these
pages
what
we
have
said
is
enough
to
bring
us
round
to
our
point
which
is
that
the
action
of
grace
on
the
individual
soul
and
the
long
line
of
direct
and
indirect
revelations
of
will
from
the
creation
to
the
present
hour
though
always
the
same
grace
and
always
the
same
revelation
receive
different
renderings
according
to
the
vehicle
in
which
they
are
held
much
as
a
motive
in
music
remains
the
same
air
though
transposed
from
one
key
to
another
not
only
therefore
does
man
as
it
were
give
a
color
of
his
own
to
the
revelation
of
god
but
he
has
the
sad
faculty
of
limiting
its
flow
and
circumscribing
its
course
even
where
he
can
not
altogether
arrest
it
we
are
of
heart
to
believe
and
therefore
is
the
time
delayed
when
the
still
unfulfilled
promises
may
take
effect
our
lord
declares
that
moses
the
hebrews
to
put
away
their
wives
because
of
the
hardness
of
their
hearts
from
the
beginning
it
was
not
law
had
never
in
itself
been
other
than
what
the
church
has
declared
it
to
be
the
state
of
matrimony
as
god
had
ordained
it
was
always
meant
to
be
what
the
church
has
now
defined
but
man
was
not
in
a
condition
to
receive
so
perfect
a
law
and
thus
the
condition
of
man
that
is
the
hardness
of
his
heart
had
the
effect
of
modifying
the
apparent
will
of
god
as
revealed
in
what
we
now
know
to
be
one
of
the
seven
sacraments
the
hebrews
were
incapable
of
anything
more
than
a
mutilated
or
rather
a
truncated
expression
of
the
divine
will
as
it
was
represented
to
them
in
the
law
of
moses
on
the
married
state
nor
could
we
anywhere
find
a
more
perfect
illustration
of
our
argument
in
the
first
place
it
is
given
us
by
our
lord
himself
and
in
the
second
it
occurs
on
a
subject
which
taken
in
its
larger
sense
involves
almost
every
other
lies
at
the
root
of
the
whole
world
of
matter
and
of
being
through
matter
and
may
be
called
the
representative
idea
of
the
creation
now
if
on
such
a
question
as
this
mankind
at
some
period
of
their
existence
and
that
a
period
which
includes
ages
of
time
and
covers
at
one
interval
or
another
the
whole
vast
globe
could
only
an
imperfect
and
utterly
defective
rendering
how
much
more
must
there
exist
to
be
still
further
developed
out
of
the
new
and
which
lie
in
the
womb
of
time
and
in
the
treasures
of
the
church
but
which
are
waiting
for
the
era
when
we
shall
be
in
a
condition
to
receive
them
the
whole
system
of
our
teaching
was
based
on
this
principle
he
seems
if
we
may
so
express
it
afraid
of
overburdening
his
disciples
by
too
great
demands
upon
their
capacity
he
says
with
reference
to
the
mission
of
john
the
baptist
you
will
receive
it
he
is
elias
that
is
to
come
and
in
the
sermon
on
the
mount
he
points
out
to
them
the
imperfection
of
the
old
moral
code
as
regarded
the
taking
of
oaths
and
the
law
of
talion
now
the
moral
law
as
it
existed
in
the
mind
of
god
could
never
have
varied
it
must
always
have
been
as
our
heavenly
father
is
but
it
passed
through
an
imperfect
medium
the
one
presented
by
the
then
condition
of
mankind
and
was
modified
accordingly
we
hold
therefore
in
what
we
have
now
stated
a
distinct
view
of
the
way
in
which
god
governs
the
world
not
absolutely
not
arbitrarily
but
and
where
we
see
imperfection
and
at
times
apparent
retrogression
it
is
the
free
will
of
man
forcing
the
will
of
god
to
his
own
destruction
he
who
hindereth
now
and
will
hinder
be
taken
out
of
the
if
this
be
true
of
direct
revelations
of
himself
and
of
his
moral
law
as
given
from
time
to
time
to
mankind
according
as
in
their
fallen
state
they
could
receive
it
if
in
short
it
be
true
of
his
direct
volitions
it
is
also
true
of
his
permissions
if
it
hold
good
of
the
revelations
of
his
antecedent
will
it
holds
good
of
the
instances
so
far
as
we
may
trace
them
in
the
history
of
the
world
of
his
consequent
will
that
is
of
his
will
which
takes
into
consideration
the
facts
induced
by
man
in
the
exercise
of
his
own
free
will
which
is
so
constantly
running
counter
to
the
antecedent
will
of
god
the
divine
permissions
form
the
negative
side
of
the
revelation
of
god
they
are
his
permissive
government
of
the
world
not
his
direct
government
the
direct
government
is
the
stream
of
revelation
given
to
our
first
parents
to
the
patriarchs
and
lawgivers
of
israel
and
now
in
a
more
direct
and
immediate
way
through
our
blessed
lord
in
his
birth
death
and
resurrection
by
the
church
in
the
sacraments
and
through
her
temporal
head
the
vicar
of
christ
even
now
when
he
has
consummated
his
union
with
his
church
and
that
she
is
the
true
organ
of
the
holy
ghost
and
thus
the
one
true
and
infallible
medium
and
interpreter
of
direct
government
of
the
world
he
also
governs
it
by
the
indirect
way
of
his
overruling
providence
the
events
which
occur
in
history
have
ever
a
double
character
they
have
their
mere
human
aspect
often
apparently
for
evil
alone
and
they
have
their
ultimate
result
for
good
which
is
simply
the
undercurrent
of
will
working
upwards
and
through
the
actions
of
mankind
events
which
on
the
face
of
them
bear
the
character
of
unmitigated
evils
like
war
have
a
thousand
ultimate
beneficial
results
war
is
the
rude
cruel
pioneer
of
the
armies
of
the
lord
for
where
the
soldier
has
been
the
priest
will
follow
persecutions
kindle
new
faith
and
awake
fresh
ardor
pestilence
quickens
charity
and
leads
to
improvements
in
the
condition
of
the
poor
nor
do
we
believe
that
it
is
only
in
this
large
and
general
unsympathetic
and
sweeping
manner
that
god
allows
good
to
be
worked
out
of
evil
we
have
faith
in
the
intercession
of
the
mother
of
mercy
and
as
ultimate
good
may
arise
to
whole
races
of
mankind
out
of
terrible
calamities
so
we
are
persuaded
there
is
a
more
intimate
minute
and
loving
interference
to
individual
souls
wherever
there
is
huge
public
calamity
the
field
of
battle
the
burning
city
the
flood
and
the
pestilence
are
harvest
fields
whither
she
sends
her
angels
over
whom
she
is
queen
with
special
and
extraordinary
graces
to
gather
and
collect
those
who
might
otherwise
have
perished
and
in
the
supreme
moment
which
is
doubtless
so
often
hour
to
win
trophies
of
mercy
to
the
honor
and
glory
of
the
precious
blood
unless
we
believe
in
essential
actual
and
unintermittent
government
of
the
world
we
can
not
solve
the
riddle
of
the
sphinx
and
her
cruel
stony
stare
will
freeze
our
blood
as
we
traverse
the
deserts
of
life
if
we
believe
only
in
his
direct
government
we
shall
find
it
chiefly
if
not
solely
in
his
church
and
the
area
is
sadly
limited
if
we
acknowledge
his
essential
providence
in
his
permissions
if
we
make
sure
of
his
presence
in
what
appears
its
very
negation
then
alone
do
we
arrive
at
the
solution
of
problems
and
even
this
not
as
an
obvious
thing
but
as
a
constant
and
act
of
faith
in
the
of
divine
love
which
melts
the
ice
and
softens
the
rigor
of
the
wintry
epochs
in
the
history
if
we
admit
of
this
theory
which
is
new
to
none
of
us
though
dim
to
some
we
let
in
a
flood
of
light
upon
many
of
the
incidents
described
in
the
old
testament
and
specially
spoken
of
as
done
by
the
will
of
god
but
which
to
our
revelation
of
god
read
to
us
as
unlike
himself
the
light
of
the
later
interpretation
has
been
thrown
over
the
earlier
fact
but
in
the
harmony
of
eternity
when
we
are
freed
from
the
broken
chord
of
time
there
will
be
no
dissonant
notes
there
can
be
no
more
wonderful
proof
of
unutterable
love
than
the
way
in
which
he
has
condescended
to
make
the
very
sins
of
mankind
work
to
his
own
glory
and
to
the
farther
revelation
of
himself
from
the
first
of
our
first
parents
as
the
church
does
not
hesitate
to
call
it
down
to
the
present
hour
down
even
to
the
secret
depths
of
our
own
souls
where
we
are
conscious
of
the
harvests
of
grace
sprung
from
repentant
tears
it
is
still
the
great
alchemist
turning
base
metal
in
the
crucible
of
divine
love
into
pure
gold
it
is
one
of
the
most
irrefragable
proofs
of
the
working
of
a
perpetual
providence
that
can
be
adduced
granted
that
there
are
no
new
creations
but
that
creation
is
one
act
evolving
itself
by
its
innate
force
into
all
the
phenomena
which
we
see
and
into
countless
possible
others
which
future
generations
of
beings
will
see
nothing
of
this
can
prevent
the
fact
that
the
moral
development
of
the
status
of
mankind
the
revelations
of
divine
truth
and
consequently
of
the
deity
through
the
flow
of
ages
has
ever
been
a
bringing
of
good
out
of
evil
which
no
blind
irresponsible
law
could
produce
there
is
no
sort
of
reason
why
evil
should
work
into
its
contrary
good
except
the
reason
that
god
is
the
supreme
good
and
directs
all
apparent
evil
into
increments
of
his
glory
thereby
converting
it
into
an
ultimate
good
we
must
remember
however
that
this
does
not
diminish
our
culpability
because
it
does
not
affect
our
it
does
not
make
evil
another
form
of
good
it
is
no
pact
with
the
devil
it
is
war
and
victory
opposition
and
conquest
it
is
justice
and
retribution
and
it
behooves
us
to
see
whether
we
are
among
those
who
are
keeping
ourselves
in
harmony
with
the
eternal
god
in
his
direct
government
of
the
world
in
harmony
so
far
as
we
know
it
with
his
antecedent
will
or
whether
we
are
allowing
ourselves
to
drift
away
into
channels
of
our
own
working
out
only
the
things
that
he
permits
but
which
he
also
condemns
and
laying
up
for
ourselves
that
swift
devouring
flame
which
will
every
work
of
what
sort
it
we
have
thus
arrived
at
two
different
views
of
government
of
the
world
his
direct
government
and
his
indirect
or
permissive
government
we
now
come
to
what
we
may
call
his
inductive
teaching
of
the
world
the
way
in
which
truths
are
partially
revealed
to
us
and
come
to
us
percolating
through
the
sands
of
time
as
mankind
needs
them
and
can
receive
them
our
lord
himself
gives
us
an
example
of
this
inductive
process
when
he
speaks
of
god
of
abraham
of
isaac
and
of
as
being
the
god
of
the
dead
but
of
the
living
thus
showing
that
the
jews
held
and
were
bound
to
hold
the
doctrine
of
immortality
by
an
inductive
process
the
teaching
of
the
old
law
was
symbolic
and
inductive
the
histories
of
the
old
testament
are
of
the
same
character
they
are
written
with
no
apparent
design
they
are
the
simple
account
of
such
incidents
as
the
historian
thought
himself
bound
to
record
acting
as
he
did
under
the
divine
impulse
which
underlay
his
statements
without
fettering
his
pen
he
was
not
himself
half
conscious
of
the
unspeakable
importance
of
his
work
consequently
there
is
no
effort
hardly
even
common
precaution
and
foresight
in
his
mode
of
chronicling
events
he
glances
at
incidents
without
explaining
them
because
while
he
wrote
they
were
present
to
his
own
experience
and
would
be
to
that
of
his
readers
a
writer
in
our
day
would
allude
to
a
person
having
performed
a
journey
of
fifty
miles
in
an
time
without
thinking
it
necessary
to
explain
that
people
travel
by
steam
in
another
part
he
would
advert
to
railroads
and
the
rapidity
of
locomotion
as
their
result
equally
without
a
direct
reference
to
the
individual
who
effected
fifty
miles
in
an
hour
to
the
reader
of
three
thousand
years
hence
the
one
incidental
allusion
will
explain
and
corroborate
the
other
and
thus
by
internal
evidence
prove
the
authenticity
and
consistency
of
the
history
unintentional
coincidences
crop
up
as
the
pages
grow
beneath
his
hand
and
to
the
careful
student
of
scripture
throw
light
unlooked
for
on
the
exactitude
and
veracity
of
the
narrative
and
the
substratum
of
the
whole
of
the
old
testament
history
is
the
gradual
growth
of
one
family
out
of
all
the
families
of
mankind
into
which
as
into
a
carefully
prepared
soil
the
seed
of
divine
truth
was
to
be
sown
through
all
the
variety
of
the
old
testament
writers
the
same
underlying
design
exists
and
though
this
was
a
special
stream
of
revelation
unlike
any
that
now
exists
or
that
is
now
required
for
reasons
which
are
obvious
to
every
catholic
who
knows
what
the
church
is
yet
they
form
an
indication
of
the
way
in
which
the
divine
creator
is
for
ever
governing
the
world
and
preparing
it
with
a
divine
foresight
for
his
ultimate
purpose
the
holy
ghost
speaks
now
through
a
direct
organ
which
organ
is
the
church
formerly
god
spoke
through
historic
events
and
multitudinous
incidents
in
connection
with
one
race
of
people
but
this
very
fact
authorizes
us
to
believe
that
the
same
of
government
exists
throughout
the
whole
universe
in
a
greater
or
less
degree
and
that
god
is
preparing
the
way
for
the
ultimate
triumph
of
the
sacred
humanity
and
of
his
spouse
the
church
on
the
shores
of
sultry
africa
in
the
inner
recesses
of
silent
china
among
the
huge
forests
which
skirt
the
blue
mountains
or
amid
the
glittering
glories
of
the
kingdoms
of
ice
there
is
nothing
more
depressingly
sad
more
deeply
to
be
regretted
and
more
difficult
to
explain
than
the
almost
hopeless
narrowness
of
most
people
in
their
appreciation
of
facts
we
live
like
moles
we
throw
up
a
mound
of
dusky
earth
above
and
around
us
within
which
we
grope
and
are
content
the
treasures
of
sacred
lore
the
depths
of
spiritual
science
the
infinite
variety
of
scriptural
information
with
the
moral
of
every
tale
are
things
which
most
of
us
are
content
to
know
exist
and
to
think
no
more
about
the
very
lavishness
with
which
god
has
given
us
all
that
we
want
for
the
salvation
of
our
souls
seems
to
have
stifled
in
our
ungenerous
natures
the
longing
to
know
and
to
do
more
when
the
evangelist
said
that
the
world
would
not
hold
the
books
that
might
be
written
on
the
sacred
humanity
alone
he
must
have
had
an
intuition
not
so
much
of
the
material
world
and
material
volumes
as
of
the
world
of
narrowed
minds
and
crippled
hearts
who
would
be
found
stranded
on
the
shores
of
our
civilization
and
progress
few
things
are
more
remarkable
in
the
tone
and
character
of
modern
catholic
writers
than
the
small
amount
of
use
they
make
of
scripture
so
strangely
in
contrast
with
the
old
writers
and
with
even
the
great
french
spiritual
authors
of
a
century
and
a
half
ago
their
pages
are
rich
with
scriptural
lore
their
style
is
a
constant
recognition
of
the
government
and
designs
of
god
as
shown
to
us
in
our
past
and
present
and
as
we
are
bound
to
anticipate
them
in
the
future
in
our
time
this
has
given
place
to
emotional
devotion
a
most
excellent
thing
in
its
way
but
only
likely
to
have
much
influence
over
our
lives
when
it
is
grounded
on
solid
theology
and
directed
by
real
knowledge
no
doubt
it
is
so
in
the
minds
of
the
authors
themselves
but
we
fear
it
is
rare
in
those
of
their
ordinary
readers
who
thus
drink
the
froth
off
the
wine
but
are
not
benefited
by
the
strengthening
properties
of
the
generous
liquid
itself
nor
will
they
be
until
they
have
made
up
their
minds
to
believe
and
understand
that
conversion
is
not
an
isolated
fact
in
their
lives
but
a
progressive
act
involving
all
the
intellect
all
the
faculties
be
they
great
or
small
for
each
one
must
be
full
up
to
his
capacity
and
all
the
heart
mind
and
soul
the
whole
man
must
work
and
be
worked
upon
in
harmony
and
we
must
remember
that
it
work
and
not
merely
feeling
consolation
emotion
prettiness
and
ornament
but
an
intellectual
growth
going
on
with
a
spiritual
growth
until
the
whole
vessel
is
fitted
and
prepared
for
the
glory
of
god
we
think
we
may
venture
to
say
that
few
things
will
conduce
more
to
this
than
the
study
of
the
divine
scriptures
under
the
light
and
teaching
of
the
catholic
church
in
them
we
find
a
profound
revelation
of
the
character
of
god
we
are
as
we
read
them
interpreted
to
us
by
the
lamp
of
the
sanctuary
let
down
into
awful
depths
of
the
divine
eternal
mind
we
watch
the
whole
world
and
all
creation
working
up
for
the
supreme
moment
of
the
birth
of
jesus
while
in
the
life
of
our
blessed
lord
himself
we
find
condensed
into
those
wonderful
years
the
whole
system
of
the
church
the
spiritual
fabric
which
is
to
fill
eternity
the
one
system
which
is
finally
to
supersede
all
others
unhappily
many
persons
are
under
the
delusion
that
narrowness
and
ignorance
are
the
same
as
christian
simplicity
and
that
innocence
means
ignorance
of
everything
else
as
well
as
of
evil
these
are
the
people
who
are
afraid
to
look
facts
in
the
face
and
to
read
them
off
as
part
of
the
history
of
the
world
these
are
they
to
whom
science
is
a
bugbear
they
hug
their
ignorance
as
being
their
great
safeguard
and
wear
blinkers
lest
they
should
be
startled
by
the
events
which
cross
their
path
grown
men
and
women
do
it
for
themselves
and
attempt
it
for
their
children
and
meanwhile
those
to
whom
we
ought
to
be
superior
are
rushing
on
with
headlong
daring
carrying
intellectual
eminence
and
originality
and
investigation
of
science
all
before
them
while
we
who
should
be
clad
in
the
panoply
of
the
faith
and
afraid
of
nothing
are
putting
out
the
candles
and
shading
the
lamps
that
we
may
idly
enjoy
a
shadow
too
dense
for
real
work
and
yet
is
not
the
earth
ours
is
not
all
that
exists
our
heritage
to
whom
does
anything
belong
if
not
to
us
the
sons
of
the
church
the
sole
possessors
of
infallible
truth
the
only
invulnerable
ones
the
only
and
children
of
the
light
the
past
is
ours
the
present
should
be
ours
the
future
is
all
our
own
our
triumph
may
be
slow
and
it
is
slower
because
we
are
cowards
but
it
is
certain
are
we
not
tenfold
the
children
of
the
covenant
the
sons
of
the
house
the
heirs
of
all
we
alone
are
in
possession
of
what
all
science
and
art
must
ultimately
fall
back
upon
and
harmonize
with
there
is
no
success
possible
but
what
is
obtained
and
shall
in
the
future
be
obtained
in
union
with
the
church
of
god
have
we
forgotten
are
we
ever
for
a
moment
permitted
to
forget
that
the
church
of
god
is
not
an
accident
nor
a
tolerably
able
partially
infirm
organization
but
that
she
is
the
spouse
of
the
the
one
revelation
of
god
perfect
and
entire
though
but
gradually
given
forth
that
all
the
harmonies
of
science
are
fragments
of
the
harmony
of
god
himself
of
his
pure
being
of
the
and
that
the
harmony
of
the
arts
is
simply
the
human
expression
of
the
harmony
of
the
the
human
utterances
of
the
articulations
of
the
divine
word
as
they
come
to
us
in
our
echoes
from
eternity
even
the
great
false
religions
of
the
past
and
of
the
present
in
the
remote
east
are
but
discord
breaking
the
harmony
of
truth
while
retaining
the
the
immortality
of
the
soul
and
the
perfection
of
a
future
state
in
the
deep
thoughts
of
egypt
the
universality
of
providential
government
of
the
world
in
greek
mythology
the
union
of
the
soul
with
god
in
brahminism
and
the
one
god
of
mahometanism
each
has
its
kernel
of
truth
its
ideal
nucleus
of
supernatural
belief
which
it
had
caught
from
the
great
harmony
of
god
in
broken
fragments
and
enshrined
in
mystic
signs
even
now
as
we
look
back
upon
them
all
we
are
bound
to
confess
that
they
stand
on
a
totally
different
ground
from
the
multitudinous
sects
of
our
day
which
break
off
from
the
one
body
of
the
church
and
drift
off
into
negation
or
protestantism
far
be
it
from
us
to
insinuate
that
any
the
lowest
form
of
christianity
the
weakest
utterance
of
the
dear
name
of
jesus
is
not
ten
thousand
fold
better
than
the
most
abstruse
of
the
old
indian
or
egyptian
religions
wherever
the
name
of
jesus
is
uttered
no
matter
how
imperfectly
there
is
more
hope
of
light
and
of
salvation
than
in
the
deepest
symbols
of
heathen
or
pagan
creeds
it
may
be
but
one
ray
of
light
but
still
it
is
light
the
real
warming
invigorating
light
of
the
sun
and
not
the
cold
and
deleterious
light
of
the
beautiful
moon
who
has
poisoned
what
she
has
borrowed
nevertheless
and
maintaining
this
with
all
the
energy
of
which
we
are
capable
it
is
still
true
that
each
one
of
the
great
false
religions
which
at
various
times
and
in
divers
places
have
swayed
mankind
was
rather
the
overgrowth
of
error
on
a
substantial
truth
than
the
breaking
up
of
truth
into
fragmentary
and
illogical
negation
which
is
the
characteristic
of
all
forms
of
secession
from
the
catholic
unity
of
the
church
the
modern
aberrations
from
the
faith
are
a
mere
jangle
of
sounds
while
the
old
creeds
were
the
petrifaction
of
truth
the
modern
forms
of
faith
outside
the
church
are
a
negation
of
truth
rather
than
a
distortion
consequently
they
are
for
ever
drifting
and
taking
protean
shapes
that
defy
classification
they
have
broken
up
into
a
hundred
forms
they
will
break
up
into
a
thousand
more
till
the
whole
fabric
has
crumbled
into
dust
they
have
none
of
the
strong
hold
on
human
nature
which
the
old
religions
had
because
they
are
not
the
embodiment
of
a
sacred
mystery
but
rather
the
explaining
away
of
all
mystery
they
are
a
perpetual
drifting
detritus
without
coherence
as
without
consistency
and
as
they
slip
down
the
slant
of
time
they
fall
into
the
abyss
of
oblivion
and
will
leave
not
a
trace
behind
only
in
so
far
that
vanishing
from
sight
they
make
way
for
the
fuller
establishment
of
the
truth
the
eternal
the
divine
spherical
truth
absolute
in
its
cohesion
and
perfect
in
all
its
parts
the
hold
which
heathen
and
pagan
creeds
have
had
upon
mankind
conveys
a
lesson
to
ourselves
which
superficial
thinkers
are
apt
to
overlook
it
is
certain
they
could
not
have
held
whole
nations
beneath
their
influence
had
not
each
in
its
turn
been
an
embodiment
of
some
essential
truth
which
though
expressed
through
error
remains
in
itself
essentially
a
part
of
truth
they
snatched
at
fragments
of
the
natural
law
which
governs
the
universe
or
they
embodied
in
present
expression
the
inalienable
hopes
of
mankind
they
took
the
world
of
nature
as
the
utterance
neither
of
a
passing
nor
of
an
inexorable
law
but
of
an
inscrutable
being
and
believed
that
the
mystical
underlies
the
natural
untaught
by
the
sweet
revelations
of
christianity
their
religion
could
assume
no
aspect
but
one
of
terror
silent
dread
and
deep
horror
their
only
escape
from
this
result
was
in
the
deterioration
that
necessarily
follows
the
popularization
of
all
abstract
ideas
unless
protected
by
a
system
at
once
consistent
and
elastic
like
that
which
is
exhibited
in
the
discipline
of
the
catholic
church
they
wearied
of
the
rarefied
atmosphere
of
unexplained
mystery
they
wanted
the
tangible
and
evident
in
its
place
like
the
israelites
they
lusted
after
the
of
egypt
and
their
lower
nature
and
evil
passions
rebelled
against
the
moral
loftiness
of
abstract
truth
the
multitude
could
not
be
kept
up
to
the
mark
and
needed
coarser
food
the
result
was
inevitable
but
as
all
religion
involves
mystery
instead
of
working
upward
through
the
natural
law
to
the
spiritual
and
divine
law
they
inverted
the
process
and
grovelled
down
below
the
natural
law
with
its
sacramentalistic
character
to
the
preternatural
and
diabolic
mystery
was
retained
but
only
in
the
profanation
of
themselves
and
of
natural
laws
until
they
had
passed
outside
all
nature
and
making
a
hideous
travesty
of
humanity
had
become
more
vile
and
hateful
than
the
devils
they
served
thus
the
romans
vulgarized
the
greek
mythology
and
that
which
had
remained
during
a
long
period
as
a
beautiful
though
purely
human
expression
of
a
divine
mystery
among
a
people
whose
religion
consisted
mainly
in
the
worship
of
the
beautiful
and
who
themselves
transcended
all
that
humanity
has
ever
since
beheld
in
their
own
personal
perfection
of
beauty
became
when
it
passed
through
the
coarser
hands
of
the
romans
a
degenerate
vulgarity
which
infected
their
whole
existence
in
art
and
in
manners
quite
as
effectually
as
in
religion
then
rome
flung
open
her
gates
to
all
the
creeds
of
all
the
world
and
the
embodiments
of
fragmentary
but
intrinsic
truth
met
together
and
were
all
equally
tolerated
and
equally
degenerated
all
except
the
one
whole
and
perfect
truth
the
gospel
of
salvation
that
was
never
tolerated
that
alone
could
not
be
endured
because
the
instinct
of
evil
foresaw
its
own
impending
ruin
in
the
gospel
of
peace
it
was
a
new
thing
for
mankind
to
be
told
that
a
part
of
the
essence
of
religion
was
elevated
morality
and
the
destruction
of
sin
in
the
individual
whatever
comparative
purity
of
life
had
with
the
old
religions
was
hardly
due
to
their
influence
among
the
multitude
though
it
might
be
so
with
those
whose
educated
superiority
enabled
them
to
reason
out
the
morality
of
creeds
while
the
rare
philosopher
was
reading
the
inmost
secret
of
the
abstract
idea
on
which
the
religion
of
his
country
was
based
and
the
common
pagan
was
practising
the
most
degraded
sorcery
and
peering
into
obscene
mysteries
without
a
single
elevation
of
thought
suddenly
the
life
of
the
was
put
before
the
world
and
the
whole
face
of
creation
was
gradually
changed
but
as
the
shadows
of
the
past
in
the
old
religions
led
up
to
the
light
so
shall
the
light
of
the
present
lead
up
to
the
to
be
continued
search
for
old
lace
in
venice
one
is
almost
ashamed
to
mention
venice
now
or
any
other
of
those
bournes
of
hackneyed
travel
and
staples
of
hackneyed
books
there
is
probably
no
one
claiming
a
place
in
a
civilized
community
who
does
not
know
venice
almost
as
well
as
do
her
own
children
and
who
could
not
discourse
intelligently
of
the
bridge
of
sighs
the
palace
and
the
rialto
bridge
of
and
the
brazen
horses
still
when
one
has
read
multitudinous
poems
about
gondolas
and
gondoliers
and
any
amount
of
descriptions
of
the
grand
canal
with
its
palaces
of
various
styles
of
architecture
and
some
few
dramas
about
the
grand
and
gloomy
the
secret
and
awful
doings
of
ancient
venetian
life
even
then
there
are
nooks
in
the
place
and
incidents
in
the
doings
which
escape
notice
a
traveller
arriving
at
venice
is
hardly
surprised
at
the
with
which
pictures
have
already
made
him
familiar
but
the
mode
of
entering
a
covered
gondola
is
not
so
familiar
and
he
generally
butts
his
head
against
the
low
ceiling
eliciting
a
laugh
from
his
gondolier
and
the
bystanders
before
he
learns
the
native
and
proper
way
of
backing
into
his
seat
so
too
in
rowing
slowly
and
dreamily
about
from
church
to
church
full
of
artistic
marvels
or
wonderful
historical
monuments
he
feels
to
a
certain
degree
at
home
he
has
seen
all
this
before
the
present
is
but
a
dream
realized
but
there
are
now
and
then
unexpected
sights
though
it
must
be
confessed
not
many
and
of
course
such
are
the
most
interesting
even
if
they
are
by
no
means
on
a
level
with
those
more
famous
and
more
beautiful
from
venice
to
vicenza
is
but
a
short
distance
by
rail
and
vicenza
boasts
of
roman
ruins
and
mediæval
churches
and
a
palladian
theatre
but
on
our
trip
there
in
early
spring
we
certainly
dwelt
more
on
the
aspect
of
the
woods
and
plains
with
their
faint
veil
of
yellow
green
already
beginning
to
appear
the
few
flowers
in
the
garden
and
the
box
hedges
and
aloes
in
the
cemetery
the
beauty
of
the
venetian
and
lombard
plains
lies
more
in
their
mere
freshness
than
in
their
diversity
it
is
entirely
a
beauty
of
detail
a
beauty
fit
for
the
minuteness
of
preraphaelite
art
rather
than
for
the
sweeping
brush
of
the
great
masters
of
conventional
landscape
painting
but
coming
from
venice
every
trace
of
verdure
was
grateful
to
the
eye
and
we
felt
as
one
who
having
been
confined
in
a
beautiful
spacious
room
filled
with
treasures
and
scented
with
subtle
perfume
might
feel
on
coming
suddenly
into
the
fresh
air
of
a
prairie
by
contrast
the
suggestion
of
fresh
air
and
open
space
draws
us
at
once
to
our
subject
a
search
after
old
lace
in
one
of
the
cities
known
to
possess
many
treasures
in
that
line
like
all
other
industries
in
venice
the
sale
of
lace
thrives
chiefly
on
the
fancy
of
the
foreign
visitors
the
natives
are
generally
too
poor
to
buy
much
of
it
and
indeed
much
of
what
is
in
the
market
is
the
product
of
forced
sacrifices
made
by
noble
but
impoverished
families
of
venetian
origin
it
is
a
sad
thing
to
see
the
spoils
of
italy
still
scattered
over
the
world
as
if
the
same
fate
had
pursued
her
with
a
few
glorious
intervals
of
triumph
and
possession
ever
since
the
barbarian
ancestors
of
her
rifled
her
under
the
banners
of
celtic
cimbrian
and
gothic
chieftains
what
brennus
alaric
and
genseric
began
the
constable
of
bourbon
and
the
great
napoleon
continued
by
force
but
what
is
still
sadder
is
to
see
the
daily
disintegration
of
other
whose
contents
are
unwillingly
but
necessarily
bartered
away
to
rich
englishmen
americans
and
russians
pictures
jewelry
lace
work
artistic
trifles
precious
through
their
material
and
history
but
more
so
through
the
family
associations
which
have
made
them
heirlooms
too
often
pass
from
the
sleepy
denuded
dilapidated
but
still
beautiful
italian
palace
to
the
cabinet
or
gallery
or
museum
of
the
lucky
foreign
connoisseur
or
even
a
worse
fate
into
the
hands
of
men
to
whom
possession
is
much
but
appreciation
very
little
while
at
venice
we
were
so
lazy
as
never
to
go
which
accounts
for
the
fact
that
we
missed
many
a
thing
which
visitors
of
a
few
days
see
and
talk
learnedly
about
and
if
the
business
activity
of
an
old
had
not
brought
her
to
the
hotel
our
search
after
lace
might
never
have
been
made
she
brought
fine
specimens
with
her
but
her
prices
were
rather
high
and
after
admiring
the
lace
she
was
dismissed
without
getting
any
orders
but
she
came
again
and
this
time
left
her
address
we
wanted
some
lace
for
a
present
and
fancied
that
the
proverbial
facility
for
taking
anything
rather
than
nothing
which
distinguishes
the
italian
seller
of
curiosities
would
induce
her
to
strike
some
more
favorable
bargain
in
her
own
house
where
no
other
customer
would
be
at
hand
to
treasure
up
her
weakness
as
a
precedent
it
was
not
easy
to
find
the
house
many
intricate
little
canals
had
to
be
traversed
for
on
foot
we
should
probably
have
lost
our
way
over
and
over
again
and
as
we
passed
many
a
quaint
court
many
a
delicate
window
many
a
sombre
archway
and
as
often
the
objects
which
we
perhaps
too
conventionally
call
picturesque
such
as
the
tattered
clothes
drying
on
long
lines
stretched
from
window
to
window
heaps
of
refuse
piled
up
against
princely
gateways
rotten
posts
standing
up
out
of
the
water
with
the
remnants
of
the
last
coat
of
paint
they
ever
had
a
hundred
years
ago
gaudy
little
shrines

to
make
a
venetian
feel
very
pious
and
an
artist
frantic
met
our
sight
at
last
the
house
was
reached
or
at
least
the
narrow
quay
from
which
a
or
tiny
dark
street
plunged
away
into
regions
unknown
but
inviting
our
gondolier
was
wise
in
the
lore
of
his
old
city
and
up
some
curious
outside
stairs
and
then
again
by
innumerable
inside
ones
we
reached
the
old
rooms
of
these
there
were
two
at
least
we
saw
no
more
both
were
poor
and
bare
and
the
old
lace
seller
was
wrinkled
unclean
and
eager
she
talked
volubly
not
being
obliged
to
use
a
foreign
tongue
to
help
herself
out
but
going
on
with
her
soft
gliding
but
quick
venetian
tones
travelling
in
italy
and
coming
in
contact
with
all
classes
of
the
people
is
apt
sadly
to
take
down
scholarly
conceit
in
knowing
the
language
of
dante
and
petrarch
for
all
the
classicism
of
goes
for
very
little
in
bargaining
for
lace
giving
orders
in
a
shop
or
market
or
trying
not
to
let
cheat
you
to
your
face
there
is
this
comfort
that
if
you
often
can
not
understand
the
people
they
can
almost
invariably
understand
you
unless
your
accent
be
altogether
outrageous
which
saves
john
bull
and
his
american
cousin
the
ignominy
of
being
brought
an
umbrella
when
they
have
asked
for
mushrooms
and
actually
taken
the
trouble
to
give
a
diagram
of
that
vegetable
the
prices
were
kept
so
obstinately
above
our
means
that
all
purchase
of
lace
was
impossible
but
the
old
woman
was
untiring
in
displaying
her
stores
of
antique
treasures
and
we
felt
sufficiently
rewarded
for
our
expedition
she
herself
was
worth
a
visit
for
like
many
ancient
italian
matrons
and
not
a
few
nearer
home
she
was
one
of
that
generation
of
models
whom
you
would
have
sworn
has
endured
from
the
days
of
titian
and
vandyke
immortally
old
and
unchangeably
wrinkled
you
see
such
faces
in
the
galleries
with
the
simple
title
of
an
old
or
old
woman
as
the
case
may
be
attributed
to
some
famous
painter
and
these
weird
portraits
attract
you
far
more
than
the
youth
and
beauty
and
health
and
prosperity
of
the
duchess
of
este
the
handsome
daughter
or
the
gorgeous
eastern
sibyl
again
you
do
not
care
to
have
any
allegorical
meaning
tacked
on
to
that
intensely
human
face
you
would
be
disgusted
if
you
found
it
set
down
in
the
catalogue
as
parca
a
magician
or
a
witch
you
seem
to
know
it
to
remember
one
which
was
like
it
to
connect
it
with
many
human
vicissitudes
and
common
though
not
the
less
pathetic
troubles
she
is
probably
poor
and
has
been
wifehood
and
motherhood
have
been
stern
realities
to
her
instead
of
poems
lived
in
luxurious
houses
and
earthly
plenty
her
romance
was
probably
short
fervid
passionate
but
soon
lapsed
into
the
dreary
struggle
of
the
poor
for
bare
life
chance
and
old
age
have
made
her
look
hard
though
in
truth
her
heart
would
melt
at
a
tender
like
that
of
a
girl
of
fifteen
and
her
brave
bright
nature
belies
the
lines
on
her
face
just
as
women
live
this
kind
of
life
nowadays
so
they
did
three
and
five
hundred
years
ago
so
did
probably
those
very
models
immortalized
by
great
painters
so
did
others
long
before
art
had
reached
the
possibility
of
truthful
portraiture
our
old
friend
the
though
she
has
given
occasion
for
this
rambling
digression
did
not
however
at
the
time
suggest
all
these
things
to
our
mind
if
she
herself
was
a
type
of
certain
models
of
the
old
masters
her
wares
were
also
a
reminder
of
famous
people
scenes
and
places
of
venice
they
were
all
of
one
kind
all
of
native
manufacture
and
of
course
all
made
by
hand
in
a
certain
degenerate
fashion
this
industry
is
still
continued
but
the
specimens
of
modern
work
which
we
saw
were
coarse
and
valueless
in
comparison
with
those
of
the
old
there
were
collars
and
cuffs
in
abundance
such
as
both
men
and
women
wore
large
broad
vandyked
collars
like
those
one
sees
in
venetian
pictures
flounces
or
rather
straight
bands
of
divers
widths
from
five
to
twenty
inches
which
had
more
probably
belonged
to
albs
and
cottas
they
suggested
rich
churches
and
gorgeous
ceremonial
in
a
time
when
nobles
and
people
were
equally
devoted
to
splendid
shows
prosperity
and
loftiness
and
a
picturesque
blending
of
the
religious
and
the
imperial
chasubles
stiff
with
gems
and
altars
of
precious
stones
seem
to
harmonize
well
with
these
priceless
veils
woven
over
with
strange
conventional
yet
beautiful
forms
intricate
with
tracery
which
put
into
stone
would
immortalize
a
sculptor
full
of
knots
each
of
which
is
a
miniature
masterpiece
of
embroidery
and
the
whole
the
evident
product
of
an
brain
this
lace
has
not
the
beauty
of
brussels
it
is
thick
and
close
in
its
texture
and
is
of
that
kind
which
looks
best
on
dark
velvets
and
heavy
dusky
cloths
just
what
one
would
fancy
the
grave
venetian
signiors
wearing
on
state
occasions
it
matches
somehow
with
the
antique
xvth
and
xvith
century
jewelry
the
magnificent
artistic
heavy
collars
of
the
great
orders
of
chivalry
it
has
something
solid
substantial
and
splendid
about
it
such
lace
used
to
be
sold
to
kings
and
senators
not
by
a
paltry
yard
measure
but
by
at
least
twice
its
weight
in
gold
for
the
price
was
many
gold
pieces
as
would
cover
the
quantity
of
lace
now
although
this
princely
mode
of
barter
is
out
of
fashion
old
venetian
is
still
one
of
the
costliest
luxuries
in
the
world
and
the
rich
foreigners
who
visit
venice
usually
carry
away
at
least
as
much
as
will
border
a
handkerchief
or
trim
a
cap
as
a
memento
of
the
beautiful
and
once
imperial
city
of
the
adriatic
the
modern
lace
one
can
scarcely
call
it
any
more
than
modern
venetian
glass
and
mosaic
can
be
so
called
seems
to
be
deficient
in
the
beauty
and
intricacy
of
design
of
the
old
specimens
it
is
so
little
sought
after
that
the
industry
stands
a
chance
of
dying
out
at
least
until
after
the
old
stock
is
exhausted
and
necessity
drives
the
to
ply
their
art
more
delicately
some
modern
lace
the
english
honiton
and
some
of
the
irish
lace
is
quite
as
perfect
and
beautiful
and
very
nearly
as
costly
as
the
undoubted
specimens
the
history
of
which
can
be
traced
back
for
two
or
three
hundred
years
but
from
what
we
saw
of
venetian
point
the
new
has
sadly
degenerated
from
the
old
and
exact
copying
of
a
few
antique
models
would
be
no
detriment
to
the
modern
productions
to
the
unlearned
eye
there
is
no
difference
between
venetian
glass
three
or
four
hundred
years
old
carefully
preserved
in
a
national
museum
and
the
manufactures
of
last
month
sold
in
warerooms
in
venice
and
his
shop
in
london
connoisseurs
say
they
detect
some
inferiority
in
the
modern
work
but
as
to
the
lace
even
the
veriest
tyro
in
such
lore
can
see
the
rough
tasteless
coarse
appearance
of
the
new
when
contrasted
with
the
old
new
publications
supposed
miracles
an
argument
for
the
honor
of
christianity
against
superstition
and
for
its
truth

buckley
is
a
methodist
minister
who
seems
to
be
a
sensible
honest
and
straightforward
person
strong
in
his
convictions
ardently
religious
and
yet
abhorring
the
excesses
of
credulity
and
irrational
enthusiasm
the
substance
of
his
pamphlet
was
delivered
by
him
as
an
address
before
a
meeting
of
methodist
ministers
and
is
principally
directed
against
some
pretences
to
miraculous
powers
and
wonderful
within
his
own
denomination
so
far
as
this
goes
his
effort
is
quite
successful
particularly
in
regard
to
a
certain
rev
platt
who
professes
to
have
been
cured
of
an
obstinate
infirmity
by
the
prayers
accompanied
by
the
imposition
of
hands
of
a
lady
by
the
name
of
miss
mossman
his
particular
object
led
him
however
to
advance
some
general
propositions
respecting
real
and
supposititious
miracles
and
to
sustain
these
by
arguments
and
appeals
to
facts
real
or
assumed
having
a
much
wider
range
and
application
than
is
embraced
by
his
special
and
immediate
purpose
as
an
ad
his
plea
may
have
been
quite
sufficient
and
convincing
to
his
particular
audience
but
as
addressed
to
a
wider
circle
in
the
form
of
a
published
pamphlet
it
appears
to
be
somewhat
deficient
in
the
quality
and
quantity
of
the
proofs
alleged
in
support
of
its
great
amplitude
and
confidence
of
assertion
it
is
also
defective
in
respect
to
the
definition
and
division
of
the
to
begin
with
his
definition
of
miracle
true
miracle
is
an
event
which
involves
the
setting
aside
or
contradiction
of
the
established
and
uniform
relations
of
antecedents
and
consequents
such
event
being
produced
at
the
will
of
an
agent
not
working
in
the
way
of
physical
cause
and
effect
for
the
purpose
of
demonstration
or
punishment
or
this
definition
errs
by
excess
and
defect
by
excess
in
including
the
scope
or
end
as
a
part
of
the
essence
by
defect
in
excluding
effects
produced
by
an
act
of
divine
power
which
is
above
all
established
and
uniform
relations
of
antecedents
and
consequents
this
last
fault
is
not
of
much
practical
importance
in
respect
to
the
question
of
the
miracles
by
which
a
divine
revelation
is
proved
or
of
ecclesiastical
miracles
because
those
which
are
simply
above
nature
called
by
thomas
miracles
of
the
first
order
as
the
incarnation
and
the
glorification
of
the
body
of
christ
are
very
few
in
number
and
are
more
objects
than
evidences
of
faith
the
first
error
however
confuses
the
subject
and
opens
the
way
to
a
summary
rejection
of
evidence
for
particular
miracles
on
the
ground
that
they
have
not
that
scope
which
has
been
defined
by
the
author
as
necessary
to
a
true
miracle
it
is
evident
that
god
can
not
give
supernatural
power
to
perform
works
whose
end
is
bad
or
which
are
simply
useless
but
we
can
not
determine
precisely
what
end
is
sufficient
in
the
view
of
god
for
enabling
a
person
to
work
a
miracle
except
so
far
as
we
learn
this
by
induction
and
the
evidence
of
facts
which
are
proved
buckley
affirms
positively
that
the
end
of
miracles
was
solely
the
authentication
of
the
divine
legation
of
christ
and
his
forerunners
in
the
mission
of
making
known
the
divine
revelation
consequently
from
this
assumption
he
asserts
that
miracles
ceased
very
early
in
the
history
of
christianity
he
also
professes
to
have
by
the
proof
of
facts
that
miracles
have
ceased
if
the
great
reformation
in
germany
switzerland
and
scotland
if
methodism
had
no
miracles
if
the
missionaries
of
the
cross
protestant
are
powerless
to
work
them
and
if
the
best
men
and
women
of
all
branches
of
the
protestant
church
are
without
this
power
then
indeed
must
they
have
no
one
will
dispute
the
logical
sequence
or
material
truth
of
this
conclusion
so
far
as
it
does
not
extend
beyond
its
own
premises
he
has
made
it
however
a
general
conclusion
and
promises
to
prove
it
by
and
irresistible
he
is
therefore
bound
to
prove
that
miracles
had
ceased
from
an
early
epoch
in
the
universal
church
including
the
whole
period
before
the
xvith
century
and
in
respect
to
all
christian
bodies
except
protestants
from
that
time
to
the
present
in
respect
to
the
former
period
his
whole
proof
consists
in
a
statement
that
no
person
of
candor
and
judgment
who
has
read
the
fathers
will
conclude
it
probable
that
miracles
continued
much
beyond
the
beginning
of
the
iid
century
and
in
the
assertion
they
have
ceased
we
have
proved
to
a
in
respect
to
supposed
miracles
during
the
latter
period
in
the
catholic
church
the
proof
that
none
of
them
are
true
miracles
is
contained
in
the
statement
that
opinion
of
the
protestant
world
is
on
that
head
very
good
buckley
such
logical
accuracy
united
with
the
intuitive
insight
of
genius
is
a
conclusive
proof
that
the
which
our
age
have
amazingly
shortened
and
simplified
the
tedious
processes
by
which
indigested
heap
and
fry
of
authors
which
they
call
were
obliged
to
investigate
truth
and
acquire
knowledge
the
reverend
gentleman
tells
us
that
have
for
some
years
past
been
reading
as
i
have
found
leisure
that
magnificent
translation
of
the
fathers
published
by
clark
of
edinburgh
in
about
twenty
five
volumes
to
say
that
i
have
been
astonished
is
to
speak
probably
the
astonishment
of
origen
justin
martyr
and
irenæus
would
be
no
less
and
would
be
more
forcibly
expressed
if
they
could
resume
their
earthly
life
and
peruse
the
remarkable
address
before
us
if
its
author
will
read
the
account
of
the
miracles
of
ss
gervasius
and
protasius
given
by
ambrose
the
of
of
augustine
the
of
ven
bede
and
on
ecclesiastical
we
can
promise
him
that
he
will
experience
a
still
greater
degree
of
astonishment
than
he
did
on
the
perusal
of
the
fathers
buckley
appears
to
be
in
and
is
probably
a
much
better
man
than
many
whose
knowledge
is
more
extensive
the
hallucination
of
mind
which
produces
in
him
the
belief
that
he
stands
on
a
higher
intellectual
plane
than
clement
of
alexandria
and
cyprian
in
ancient
times
or
petavius
kleutgen
bayma
and
in
general
is
so
simply
astounding
and
the
credulity
requisite
to
a
firm
assent
to
his
own
statements
as
is
so
much
beyond
that
which
was
in
the
olden
time
shown
by
believing
in
the
that
he
must
be
sincere
though
very
much
in
need
of
information
we
can
not
help
feeling
that
he
is
worthy
of
knowing
better
and
would
be
convinced
of
the
truth
if
it
were
set
before
him
fairly
it
is
plain
that
he
has
no
knowledge
of
the
evidence
which
exists
of
a
series
of
miracles
wrought
in
the
catholic
church
continuously
from
the
times
of
the
apostles
to
our
own
day
and
which
can
not
be
rejected
without
subverting
the
evidence
on
which
the
truth
of
all
miracles
whatsoever
is
based
the
number
of
these
which
are
considered
by
prudent
catholic
writers
to
be
quite
certain
or
probable
is
beyond
reckoning
though
still
very
small
in
comparison
with
ordinary
events
and
the
experiences
of
the
whole
number
of
catholics
in
all
ages
those
of
the
most
extraordinary
magnitude
are
relatively
much
fewer
in
number
than
those
which
are
less
wonderful
as
for
instance
the
raising
of
the
dead
to
life
nevertheless
there
are
instances
of
this
kind
those
related
of
dominic
bernard
teresa
and
francis
xavier
which
to
say
the
least
have
a
probability
one
of
another
kind
is
the
miracle
of
the
liquefaction
of
the
blood
of
januarius
the
miraculous
and
complete
cure
of
mattingly
of
washington
is
an
instance
which
occurred
in
our
own
country
and
which
among
many
other
intelligent
protestants
john
calhoun
considered
as
most
undoubtedly
effected
by
miraculous
agency
we
mention
one
more
only
the
restoration
of
the
destroyed
vision
of
one
eye
by
the
application
of
the
water
of
lourdes
in
the
case
of
bourriette
as
related
by
lasserre
we
are
rather
more
cautious
in
professing
to
have
demonstrated
the
continuance
of
miracles
than
our
reverend
friend
has
been
in
respect
to
the
contrary
we
profess
merely
to
show
that
his
demonstration
requires
a
serious
refutation
of
the
arguments
in
favor
of
the
proposition
he
denies
and
to
bring
forward
some
considerations
in
proof
of
the
title
which
these
arguments
have
to
a
respectful
and
candid
examination
moreover
though
we
can
not
pretend
to
prove
anything
et
by
conclusive
evidence
and
reasoning
we
refer
to
the
articles
on
the
miracle
of
januarius
and
to
the
translation
of
book
in
our
own
pages
as
containing
evidence
for
two
of
the
instances
alluded
to
and
to
the
works
of
bishop
england
for
the
evidence
in
case
besides
those
supernatural
effects
or
events
which
can
only
be
produced
by
a
divine
power
acting
immediately
on
the
subject
there
are
other
marvellous
effects
which
in
themselves
require
only
a
supermundane
power
and
are
merely
preternatural
using
nature
in
the
sense
which
excludes
all
beyond
our
own
world
and
our
human
nature
other
unusual
events
again
may
appear
to
be
preternatural
but
may
be
proved
or
reasonably
conjectured
to
proceed
from
a
merely
natural
cause
here
is
a
debatable
land
where
the
truth
is
attainable
with
more
difficulty
generally
with
less
certainty
and
where
there
is
abundant
chance
for
unreasonable
credulity
and
equally
unreasonable
scepticism
to
lose
their
way
in
opposite
directions
buckley
summarily
refers
all
the
strange
phenomena
to
be
found
among
pagan
religions
to
jugglery
and
fanaticism
spiritism
he
dismisses
without
a
word
of
comment
implying
that
he
considers
it
to
be
in
no
sense
preternatural
we
differ
from
him
in
opinion
in
respect
to
this
point
also
we
have
no
doubt
that
many
alleged
instances
of
preternatural
events
are
to
be
explained
by
natural
causes
and
many
others
by
jugglery
and
imposture
we
can
not
for
ourselves
find
a
reasonable
explanation
of
a
certain
number
of
facts
in
regard
to
both
paganism
and
spiritism
except
on
the
hypothesis
of
preternatural
agency
the
nature
of
that
agency
can
not
be
determined
without
recurring
to
theological
science
catholic
theology
determines
such
cases
by
referring
them
to
the
agency
of
demons
buckley
is
afraid
to
admit
that
the
alleged
were
real
and
wrought
by
so
he
continues
may
ask
in
the
language
of
job
where
and
what
is
god
we
answer
to
this
that
god
does
not
permit
demons
to
deceive
men
to
such
an
extent
as
to
cause
the
ruin
of
their
souls
except
through
their
own
wilful
and
culpable
submission
to
these
deceits
it
makes
no
difference
whether
the
delusion
produced
is
referred
to
jugglery
or
demonology
in
respect
to
this
particular
question
the
formation
of
christendom
part
third
by
allies
london
longmans
mr
allies
dedicates
this
volume
in
very
beautiful
and
appropriate
terms
to
newman
who
he
says
in
classic
and
graceful
phrase
having
once
been
hector
of
a
doomed
troy
is
now
achilles
of
the
city
of
the
particular
topic
of
the
book
is
the
relation
of
greek
philosophy
to
the
christian
church
a
remarkable
chapter
on
the
foundation
of
the
roman
church
in
which
great
use
is
made
of
the
discoveries
of
archæologists
precedes
the
treatment
of
the
neostoic
neopythagorean
and
neoplatonic
schools
with
cognate
topics
one
of
the
most
interesting
and
novel
chapters
is
that
on
apollonius
of
tyana
whose
wonderful
life
as
related
by
philostratus
the
author
regards
as
a
philosophic
and
myth
invented
by
the
pagan
writer
with
only
a
slight
basis
of
historical
truth
mr
allies
has
studied
the
deep
thoughtful
works
of
those
german
authors
who
give
a
truly
intelligent
and
connected
history
of
philosophy
and
his
work
is
a
valuable
contribution
to
that
branch
of
science
as
well
as
to
the
history
of
christianity
one
of
the
most
irresistible
proofs
of
the
divine
mission
and
divine
personality
of
jesus
christ
lies
in
the
blending
of
the
elements
of
hellenic
genius
and
culture
jewish
faith
and
roman
law
into
a
new
composite
by
a
new
form
when
he
founded
his
universal
kingdom
a
mere
man
by
his
own
natural
power
and
under
the
circumstances
in
which
he
lived
could
not
have
conceived
such
an
idea
much
less
have
carried
it
into
execution
the
most
ineffably
stupid
as
well
as
atrociously
wicked
of
all
impostors
and
philosophical
charlatans
are
those
apostate
christians
who
strive
to
drag
christianity
down
to
the
level
of
the
pagan
systems
of
religion
and
philosophy
and
reduce
it
to
a
mere
natural
phenomenon
mr
allies
shows
this
in
a
work
which
combines
erudition
with
a
grace
of
style
formed
on
classic
models
and
an
enlightened
fervent
catholic
spirit
imbibed
from
the
fathers
and
doctors
of
the
church
at
a
time
when
the
popular
philosophy
is
decked
in
false
hair
and
as
a
it
is
cheering
to
find
here
and
there
a
votary
of
that
genuine
philosophy
whose
beauty
is
native
and
real
and
who
willingly
proclaims
her
own
subjection
and
inferiority
by
humbly
saying
ancilla
the
american
catholic
quarterly
review
vol
i
no
january
philadelphia
hardy
mahony
a
very
large
number
of
the
most
highly
gifted
and
learned
catholics
throughout
christendom
both
clergymen
and
laymen
are
at
present
employed
in
writing
for
the
reviews
of
various
classes
which
have
existed
for
a
greater
or
lesser
period
of
time
within
the
present
century
much
of
the
very
best
literature
of
the
age
is
to
be
found
in
their
articles
and
a
very
considerable
part
of
this
is
of
permanent
value
in
solid
merit
of
matter
and
style
and
in
adaptation
to
the
wants
of
the
time
the
best
of
these
periodicals
have
improved
steadily
and
we
may
say
of
some
of
them
that
they
hardly
admit
of
any
farther
progress
the
advantage
of
such
periodicals
is
not
only
very
great
for
their
readers
but
almost
equally
so
for
those
who
are
engaged
in
contributing
to
their
contents
the
effort
and
practice
of
writing
constantly
for
the
public
react
upon
the
writers
each
one
is
encouraged
and
instructed
in
the
most
useful
and
effective
method
of
directing
his
studies
and
giving
verbal
expression
to
their
results
so
as
to
attain
the
practical
end
he
has
in
view
that
of
disseminating
and
diffusing
knowledge
over
as
wide
an
extent
as
possible
the
combination
of
various
writers
each
having
one
or
more
specialties
under
a
competent
editorial
direction
secures
variety
and
versatility
without
prejudice
to
unity
and
corrects
the
excesses
or
defects
of
individuality
without
checking
originality
thus
giving
to
the
resulting
work
in
some
respects
a
superiority
over
that
which
is
the
product
of
one
single
mind
unless
that
mind
possesses
the
gifts
and
acquisitions
in
which
are
usually
found
divided
among
a
number
of
different
persons
to
conduct
a
review
alone
is
a
herculean
task
and
brownson
has
accomplished
a
work
which
is
really
astonishing
in
maintaining
almost
by
unaided
effort
through
so
many
years
a
periodical
of
the
high
rank
accorded
by
common
consent
to
the
one
which
bore
his
name
and
will
be
his
perpetual
monument
that
at
the
present
juncture
a
new
review
is
necessary
and
has
a
fine
field
open
before
it
that
in
its
management
ecclesiastical
direction
and
episcopal
control
are
requisite
for
adequate
security
and
weight
with
the
catholic
public
and
that
full
opportunity
for
efficient
on
the
part
of
laymen
of
talent
and
education
is
most
desirable
can
not
admit
of
a
doubt
it
is
therefore
a
matter
of
congratulation
that
the
favorable
moment
has
been
so
promptly
seized
and
the
vacant
place
so
quickly
occupied
by
the
gentlemen
who
have
undertaken
the
editing
and
the
publishing
of
the
catholic
it
is
probably
known
to
most
if
not
all
of
our
readers
that
the
editors
are
corcoran
professor
in
the
ecclesiastical
seminary
of
philadelphia
the
rector
of
that
institution
and
wolff
who
has
long
and
ably
edited

would
be
difficult
to
find
in
the
united

an
equally
competent
triad
the
publishers
who
have
already
the
experience
acquired
by
the
management
of
a
literary
magazine
and
a
newspaper
will
we
may
reasonably
hope
be
able
to
sustain
the
financial
burden
of
this
greater
undertaking
in
a
successful
manner
if
they
receive
the
support
which
they
have
a
right
to
expect
by
means
of
their
subscription
list
the
first
number
of
the
new

presents
a
typographical

which
is
quite
peculiar

and
decidedly
attractive

best
wishes
to

associations
the
indian
question
continues
to
be
one
of
the
most
troublesome
in
our
national
politics
its
only
real
solution
and
we
believe
this
to
be
president
opinion
is
to
christianize
the
indians
the
task
is
undoubtedly
a
hard
one
but
it
would
be
far
less
so
if
wolves
in
clothing
had
not
been
sent
among
them
the
only
successful
attempt
at
civilizing
the
indians
has
been
made
by
catholic
missionaries
but
under
the
administration
of
the
indian
bureau
the
utter
rottenness
of
which
has
been
so
recently
exposed
missions
and
reservations
have
been
thrown
to
this
religious
agency
and
that
without
the
slightest
regard
for
the
wishes
of
those
who
it
is
to
be
supposed
were
most
to
be
benefited
by
the
operation
the
indians
themselves
in
this
way
flourishing
catholic
missions
were
turned
over
to
the
methodist
or
other
denominations
and
the
representations
of
the
missionaries
as
well
as
of
the
chiefs
and
tribes
themselves
were
of
no
avail
whatever
to
alter
so
iniquitous
a
proceeding
this
little
manual
gives
a
brief
sketch
of
the
status
of
catholic
indians
and
working
of
the
bureau
of
indian
missions
it
contains
also
an
earnest
appeal
to
the
catholic
ladies
of
the
united
states
from
the
catholic
indian
missionary
association
of
washington
urging
contributions
and
the
formation

aid
in

a
correction
to
the
editor
of
the
catholic
world
i
have
just
received
through
the
catholic
publication
society
the
following
card
from
gladstone
gladstone
desires
to
send
with
his
compliments
his
thanks
to
the
society
for
a
copy
which
he
has
received
of
interesting
paper
on
having
simply
cited
his
authorities
and
used
them
as
he
thinks
fairly
he
will
be
glad
to
learn
if
he
can
the
manner
in
which
they
meet
the
challenge
conveyed
in
the
latter
portion
of
this
paper
present
object
is
to
say
he
would
be
greatly
obliged
by
a
to
enable
him
to
trace
the
imputed
to
him
on
page
as
his
have
no
page
and
he
is
not
aware
of
having
penned
such
a
passage
carlton
gardens
london
gladstone
is
right
in
disclaiming
the
words
imputed
to
him
in
this
instance
they
are
on
investigation
found
to
be
the
words
of
the
rev
schaff
the
harper
the
american
publishers
of
tracts
are
largely
responsible
for
the
mistake
by
having
inserted
in
their
publication
a
tract
of
schaff
paged
in
common
and
all
covered
by
the
outside
title
of
and
the
newest

and
by
the
giving
the
authorship
the
right
hon
to
a
writer
making
selections
as
needed
from
different
portions
of
this
book
the
mistake
was
easy
and
natural
and
though
the
authorship
of
of
the
vatican
containing
the
passage
in
question
is
given
it
is
not
so
given
as
easily
to
reach
the
eye
and
is
obscured
by
the
introduction
of
tract
into
a
volume
under

by
paging

secret
warfare
of

those
in
this
country
who
respect
religion
law
and
the
peace
of
society
should
not
be
imposed
upon
by
the
aspect
of
freemasonry
here
the
principles
and
modes
of
acting
of
the
society
are
those
we
have
described
the
application
of
them
depends
wholly
on
time
place
and
circumstances
the
ordinary
observer
sees
nothing
in
the
members
of
the
craft
here
but
a
number
of
inoffensive
individuals
who
belong
to
a
benevolent
association
which
by
means
of
secret
signs
enables
them
to
get
out
of
the
clutches
of
the
law
procure
employment
and
office
and
obtain
other
advantages
not
possessed
by
the
rest
of
their
but
then
the
innocent
rank
and
file
are
the
dead
weight
which
the
society
employs
on
occasion
to
aid
in
compassing
its
ulterior
designs
here
there
are
no
civil
or
religious
institutions
which
stand
in
their
way
and
their
mode
of
action
is
to
sap
and
mine
the
morals
of
the
community
on
which
society
rests
and
with
which
it
must
perish
of
what
it
is
capable
if
it
seems
needful
to
compassing
its
ends
any
one
may
understand
by
the
fiendish
murder
of
william
morgan
this
murder
was
decided
on
at
a
directed
by
freemason
officials
pursuance
of
the
rules
of
the
and
was
perpetrated
by
freemasons
bearing
a
respectable
character
who
had
never
before
been
guilty
of
a
criminal
action
who
were
known
yet
were
never
punished
nor
even
tried
but
died
a
natural
death
and
who
do
not
appear
to
have
experienced
any
loss
of
reputation
for
their
foul
deed
see
thurlow
recent
letter
to
the
new
york
before
we
proceed
to
expose
the
even
yet
more
hideous
loathsomeness
of
this
vile
association
a
few
words
of
explanation
are
necessary
in
all
we
write
we
have
in
view
an
organization
its
constitution
and
motives
and
that
only
the
individual
responsibility
of
its
several
members
is
a
matter
for
their
own
conscience
it
is
no
affair
of
ours
we
believe
that
the
bulk
of
the
association
all
up
to
the
thirtieth
degree
or
of
the
white
eagle
or
are
in
complete
ignorance
of
the
hellish
criminality
of
its
objects
even
the
rosicrucian
has
something
to
learn
although
to
have
become
that
he
must
have
stamped
himself
with
the
mark
of
antichrist
by
the
abandonment
of
his
belief
in
christ
and
in
all
revealed
religion
but
the
vast
majority
whose
numbers
influence
and
respectability
the
dark
leaders
use
for
the
furtherance
of
their
monstrous
designs
live
and
die
in
complete
ignorance
of
the
real
objects
and
principles
of
the
craft
we
ourselves
know
an
instance
of
an
individual
now
reconciled
to
the
church
who
was
once
a
master
mason
and
who
to
this
moment
is
in
utter
ignorance
of
them
they
are
sedulously
concealed
from
all
who
have
not
dispossessed
themselves
of
the
of
religion
and
the
author
of
the
work
to
which
we
are
indebted
for
almost
all
our
documentary
evidence
mentions
the
case
of
one
who
had
advanced
to
the
high
grade
of
rosicrucian
but
who
not
until
he
was
initiated
into
the
grade
of
kadosch
was
completely
stunned
and
horrified
by
the
demoniacal
disclosures
poured
into
his
ears
most
of
the
freemasons
however
have
joined
the
body
as
a
mere
philanthropic
institution
or
on
the
lower
motive
of
nor
is
it
possible
to
convince
these
people
of
the
fearful
consequences
to
which
they
are
contributing
of
course
but
few
of
these
it
is
to
be
hoped
are
involved
in
the
full
guilt
of
the
every
catholic
who
belongs
to
it
is
in
mortal
sin
for
the
rest
we
can
not
but
hope
and
believe
that
an
overwhelming
majority
are
innocent
of
any
sinister
motives
but
it
is
impossible
to
exonerate
them
entirely
for
first
the
is
now
pursuing
its
operations
with
such
unblushing
effrontery
that
it
is
difficult
for
any
but
illiterate
people
to
plead
entire
ignorance
and
next
no
one
can
without
moral
guilt
bind
himself
by
terrible
oaths
for
the
breaking
of
which
he
consents
to
be
assassinated
to
keep
inviolable
secrets
with
the
nature
of
which
he
is
previously
unacquainted
it
can
not

be

generally
resided

misbehavior
of
the
loungers
about
the
court
he
did
not
go
out
of
his
way
to
find

there
was
a
somewhat
similar
office
of
very
ancient
institution
at
the
imperial
court
of
constantinople
the
holder
of
which
was
called
peter
filargo
was
a
greek
from
the
island
of
candia
which
may
account
for
his
love
of

at

corresponded
to
the
symposium
of
the
ancients
a
species
of
enjoyment
when
wine
being
introduced
philosophical
or
other
agreeable
subjects
were
discussed
the
special
significance
of
this
title
given
to
cardinal
mccloskey
is
that
his
predecessor
in
the
see
of
new
york
and
its
first
bishop
luke
concanen
who
was
consecrated
in

on

in

that

movement

bodies
acquire
greater

by

this
point
in

an
anachronism
in
costume
which
in

would
not
be
pardonable

it
was
common
enough
until

in

on

than
once
in
reading
defences
of

written
with
the
best
intentions
we
could
not
resist
a
desire
that
in
the
of
the
saints
or
other
prayers
of
the
church
there
might
be
inserted
some
such
invocation
as
this
malis

libera

mischievous
advocates
o
lord
deliver
we
say
this
most
earnestly
the
more
so
that
it
applies
also
to
ourselves
many
a
time
when
preparing
our
writings
we
have
experienced
a
feeling
not
unlike
that
of
an
advocate
fully
convinced
of
the
innocence
of
the
accused
but
dreading
lest
by
want
of
clearness
or
other
defect
in
putting
forth
his
arguments
he
might
not
only
fail
to
carry
conviction
to
the
mind
of
the
judges
but
also
prejudice
the
cause
he
wishes
to
defend
never
perhaps
is
the
necessity
of
prayer
more
deeply
with
regard
to
the
powers
of
the
sovereign
over

episcopate
we
quote
the
following
from
the
london
for

other
tremendous
against
the
claims
for
the
church
of
england
by
the
high

party
a
candid
writer
in
the
is
staggered
by
the
oath
of
allegiance
according
to
which
we
have
the
chief
pastors
of
the
church
declaring
in
the
most
solemn
manner
that
they
receive
the
spiritualities
of
their
office
from
the
queen
and
are
bishops
by
her
grace
in
connection
with
the
foregoing
we
can
not
refrain
from
citing
a
passage
from
marshall
which
is
as
follows
bishops
can
only
obtain
spiritual
jurisdiction
in
one
of
two
ways
either
by
receiving
it
from
those
who
already
possess
it
in
which
case
their
the
english
search
must
extend
beyond
their
own
communion
or
by
imitating
the
two
lay
travellers
in
china
of
whom
we
have
somewhere
read
who
fancied
they
should
like
to
be
missionaries
whereupon
the
one
ordained
the
other
and
was
then
in
turn
ordained
by
to
the
great
satisfaction
of
see
for
july
since
writing
the
above
we
happened
to
see
the
following
case
in
point
in
the
of
september
in
which
a
clergyman
signing
himself
priest
of
the
diocese
of
exeter
writes
a
letter
of
remonstrance
against
the
violent
abuse
heaped
by
priest
of
the
diocese
of
against
the
late
learned
and
venerable
vicar
of
morwenstow
hawker
who
on
the
day
before
his
death
made
his
submission
to
the
catholic
church
from
this
letter
which
contains
many
candid
and
interesting
admissions
we
quote
the
following
these
days
when
we
have
among
us
so
many
dignitaries
and
popular
preachers
of
the
established
church
who
in
their
teaching
deny
all
sacramental
truth
while
others
can
not
repeat
the
nicene
and
athanasian
creeds
without
a
gloss
and
others
again
boldly
assert
that
old
religious
ideas
expressed
in
the
creed
must
be
thrown
into
afresh
form
if
they
are
to
retain
their
hold
on
the
educated
minds
of
the
present
generation
it
appears
monstrous
that
a
clergyman
whose
faithful
adhesion
to
the
prayer
book
during
a
ministry
of
forty
years
was
notorious
should
be
denounced
as
a
rogue
and
a
he
held
opinions
which
are
considered
by
some
individual
members
of
either
church
as
denoting
roman

heart

in

of

liberty
granted

this
in

came
to
the
notice

the
fact
that
an

been
one
of

to

whether

be

the

always
the
true

guardian
of

raised
her
voice
in

favor

are
more
than
astonished
at
the
ignorance

bad
faith
of
burnet

takes
advantage
of
this
fact
to
accuse
the
cardinal

licentiousness

young

it
is
however
something
more
than
a
hypothesis
the
confirmation
it
receives
from
the
fact
that
since
the
prevalence
amongst
so
large
a
portion
of
mankind
of
an
uniformity
of
rite
and
dogma
and
the
universality
of
brotherhood
occasioned
thereby
what
seemed
to
be
obstacles
have
become

of
intercommunion

such
an
extent
that

in

there
are
one
or
two
passages

indicate
a
belief
that
the

was
more
than

admitted

the

vision
