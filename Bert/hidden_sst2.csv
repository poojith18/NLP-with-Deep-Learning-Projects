"simplistic , silly and tedious ."
"it's so laddish and juvenile , only teenage boys could possibly find it funny ."
exploitative and largely devoid of the depth or sophistication that would make watching such a graphic treatment of the crimes bearable .
"[garbus] discards the potential for pathological study , exhuming instead , the skewed melodrama of the circumstantial situation ."
a visually flashy but narratively opaque and emotionally vapid exercise in style and mystification .
"the story is also as unoriginal as they come , already having been recycled more times than i'd care to count ."
about the only thing to give the movie points for is bravado -- to take an entirely stale concept and push it through the audience's meat grinder one more time .
not so much farcical as sour .
unfortunately the story and the actors are served with a hack script .
"all the more disquieting for its relatively gore-free allusions to the serial murders , but it falls down in its attempts to humanize its subject ."
a sentimental mess that never rings true .
"while the performances are often engaging , this loose collection of largely improvised numbers would probably have worked better as a one-hour tv documentary ."
"interesting , but not compelling ."
"on a cutting room floor somewhere lies . . . footage that might have made no such thing a trenchant , ironic cultural satire instead of a frustrating misfire ."

"here , common sense flies out the window , along with the hail of bullets , none of which ever seem to hit sascha ."
this 100-minute movie only has about 25 minutes of decent material .
the execution is so pedestrian that the most positive comment we can make is that rob schneider actually turns in a pretty convincing performance as a prissy teenage girl .
"on its own , it's not very interesting . as a remake , it's a pale imitation ."
it shows that some studios firmly believe that people have lost the ability to think and will forgive any shoddy product as long as there's a little girl-on-girl action .
"a farce of a parody of a comedy of a premise , it isn't a comparison to reality so much as it is a commentary about our knowledge of films ."
"as exciting as all this exoticism might sound to the typical pax viewer , the rest of us will be lulled into a coma ."
the party scenes deliver some tawdry kicks . the rest of the film . . . is dudsville .
our culture is headed down the toilet with the ferocity of a frozen burrito after an all-night tequila bender ó and i know this because i've seen 'jackass : the movie . '
"the criticism never rises above easy , cynical potshots at morally bankrupt characters . . ."
"the movie's something-borrowed construction feels less the product of loving , well integrated homage and more like a mere excuse for the wan , thinly sketched story . killing time , that's all that's going on here ."

i didn't laugh . i didn't smile . i survived .
"please , someone , stop eric schaeffer before he makes another film ."

curling may be a unique sport but men with brooms is distinctly ordinary .

"the effort is sincere and the results are honest , but the film is so bleak that it's hardly watchable ."
"analyze that regurgitates and waters down many of the previous film's successes , with a few new swings thrown in ."
"with flashbulb editing as cover for the absence of narrative continuity , undisputed is nearly incoherent , an excuse to get to the closing bout . . . by which time it's impossible to care who wins ."

"to the civilized mind , a movie like ballistic : ecks vs . sever is more of an ordeal than an amusement ."
equlibrium could pass for a thirteen-year-old's book report on the totalitarian themes of 1984 and farenheit 451 .
the lack of naturalness makes everything seem self-consciously poetic and forced . . . it's a pity that [nelson's] achievement doesn't match his ambition . 
everything is off .
"the rock is destined to be the 21st century's new "" conan "" and that he's going to make a splash even greater than arnold schwarzenegger , jean-claud van damme or steven segal ."
"the gorgeously elaborate continuation of "" the lord of the rings "" trilogy is so huge that a column of words cannot adequately describe co-writer/director peter jackson's expanded vision of j . r . r . tolkien's middle-earth ."
effective but too-tepid biopic
"if you sometimes like to go to the movies to have fun , wasabi is a good place to start ."
