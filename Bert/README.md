I have included all running python files in run.sh and once you run this script, results will get printed in the order.

Also, you can run each *.py file to see the results seperately.

Below are the total four python(.py) files:

1)main_rte_WFT.py -- Code for RTE task with finetuning
2)main_rte_WOFT.py -- Code for RTE task without finetuning
3)main_sst2_WFT.py -- Code for SST2 task with finetuning
4)main_sst2_WOFT.py -- Code for SST2 task without finetuning
