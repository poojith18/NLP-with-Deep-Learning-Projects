“It is to Chronology that History owes its use and beauty; as being without it a mere chaos, a jumble of facts confusedly heaped together, and consequently capable of affording neither pleasure nor instruction.”—LOCKE.

 PREFACE.
 Few words only are necessary to introduce this Third Edition to our readers, beyond expressing a hope that the contents will meet with general approbation, and that much pleasure will be derived from its perusal, now and for many years to come.
We would ask, as a SPECIAL FAVOUR, in order to ensure a wider circulation, that our friends will recapitulate the comments of the Press, by recommending this _History of Yarmouth_ as “worthy of a place in every library.”
It is seven years since the Second Edition, without supplement, was published.
No greater honour could have been conferred upon the Author than when the Heir Apparent to the Throne of England (His Royal Highness the PRINCE OF WALES, K.G.), on his visit to Yarmouth in 1882, expressed his pleasure, through Colonel Teesdale, in the acceptance as a present, of a copy of this History; and the placing of this work, with supplement (A.D. 46 to 1879) in the principal stone of the New Town Hall in 1880 by the then Mayor (C. C. Aldred, Esq.) was also gratifying.
EDWARD BIRKBECK, ESQ., M.P., writing to us from the House of Commons, on March 19th, 1884, says:—“I do not think my name is worthy of having a book dedicated to me, but I shall nevertheless be proud to have it placed where you suggest.”
The people of Yarmouth will endorse our sentiments when we say, for his zeal and untiring energy in promoting many special objects in the “good old town,” that he is worthy of greater eulogiums than we can bestow, and therefore tender our best thanks to that gentleman for his courtesy in allowing this volume to be dedicated to him—a privilege that was also given us in a first issue, by his predecessor in the Imperial Parliament, the lamented COLONEL DUFF. Neither must we forget to express our obligation to a select list of subscribers to the work.
GREAT YARMOUTH, APRIL, 1884.
* * * * *
TO EDWARD BIRKBECK, ESQ. M.P. FOR NORTH NORFOLK, THIS BOOK (WITH PERMISSION) IS MOST RESPECTFULLY DEDICATED BY HIS OBEDIENT AND HUMBLE SERVANT,
WM. FINCH-CRISP.

 Crisp’s History Of Great Yarmouth.
 A.D. 46.
 The Romans entered this part of Britain when the valleys of the Yare, Waveney, and Bure, as well as the sand-bank upon which Yarmouth stands, were covered by the ocean.

100.
 Burgh Castle, a Roman encampment, supposed to have been founded.

495.
 Cerdic, a Saxon Prince, and Qenrick his son, with five ships, entered the port of Yarmouth and named in Cerdic Shore.
This Cerdic Shore seems to have been a great sand-bank formed along the shore between two branches or channels of the Yare called Havens, by which two channels the river entered the sea, one running near Caister and the other near Gorleston.

633.
 Between this and the year 640, a Saxon Monastery was founded at Burgh, by Fursey, an Irish monk.

870.
 Lodbrog, the Dane, driven by a sudden tempest from Denmark across the sea, and, entering the Yare, landed at Reedham, where the Court of Edmund, King of East Anglia, was then kept.
Lodbrog is said to have been received into Court favour, but was soon afterwards murdered in a wood by the King’s huntsman (Bern) through jealousy.
This led to the imprisonment and execution of Edmund, and put an end to the Saxon dynasty in East Anglia, after Hinguar and Hubba, two Danish chieftains, at the head of 20,000 men, had ravished all East Anglia.

1008.
 First houses and habitations erected in Yarmouth on Fuller’s Hill, that being then the only dry land in Yarmouth.

He was made Lord High Chancellor to Henry I. of England in 1104, and died August 11th, 1119.

1119.
 St. Nicholas’ Church consecrated.

In 1622 they were repaired, and in 1674 rebuilt.

They went at a slow pace, and at the entrance of Regent Street were joined by the Mayor and other Borough Officers.
It was past 12 o’clock when the prisoner arrived at the place of execution; on his way thither he was perfectly composed, turning from one side to the other, viewing the populace.
After ascending the scaffold, he spent some time in prayer, and when the hangman had placed the rope round his neck, he was asked if he had anything farther to say.
He then confessed as follows: ‘That he was the murderer of his wife by strangling her with his hands, and not with a rope, as had been stated; he said they had lived a very uncomfortable life for many years past, owing to his wife giving her company to other men, which was the cause of his committing the murder.’
The instant before being turned off, he particularly requested to see his daughter, when he was informed it was not possible, as she was confined in Bedlam; he also desired the gaoler to look under the step of the cell, and he would there find four shillings and sixpence.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm
Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.
It exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from people in all walks of life.
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will remain freely available for generations to come.
In 2001, the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org

Section 4.
Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest array of equipment including outdated equipment.
Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the IRS.
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United States.
Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these requirements.
We do not solicit donations in locations where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.
To SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who approach us with offers to donate.
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside the United States.
U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation methods and addresses.
Donations are accepted in a number of other ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To donate, please visit:

 Section 5.
General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone.
For forty years, he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.
Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included.
Thus, we do not necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.
Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:
www.gutenberg.org
This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm, including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
