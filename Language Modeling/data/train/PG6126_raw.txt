QUOTATIONS FROM THE HISTORICAL NOVELS OF GEORG EBERS
 UARDA,







 by Georg Ebers, v1
[GE#01][ge01v10.txt]5439
A dirty road serves when it makes for the goal Colored cakes in the shape of beasts Deficient are as guilty in their eyes as the idle For fear of the toothache, had his sound teeth drawn Hatred between man and man Hatred for all that hinders the growth of light How tender is thy severity Judge only by appearances, and never enquire into the causes Often happens that apparent superiority does us damage Seditious words are like sparks, which are borne by the wind The scholar's ears are at his back: when he is flogged Title must not be a bill of fare Youth should be modest, and he was assertive

 UARDA,







 by Georg Ebers, v2
[GE#02][ge02v10.txt]5440
Blossom of the thorny wreath of sorrow Eyes kind and frank, without tricks of glance Money is a pass-key that turns any lock Repugnance for the old laws began to take root in his heart Thou canst say in words what we can only feel Whether the form of our benevolence does more good or mischief

 UARDA,







 by Georg Ebers, v3
[GE#03][ge03v10.txt]5441
Bearers of ill ride faster than the messengers of weal Do not spoil the future for the sake of the present Exhibit one's happiness in the streets, and conceal one's misery Impartial looker-on sees clearer than the player Learn to obey, that later you may know how to command Man has nothing harder to endure than uncertainty Many creditors are so many allies One should give nothing up for lost excepting the dead Our thinkers are no heroes, and our heroes are no sages Overbusy friends are more damaging than intelligent enemies Prepare sorrow when we come into the world The experienced love to signify their superiority We quarrel with no one more readily than with the benefactor

 UARDA,







 by Georg Ebers, v4
[GE#04][ge04v10.txt]5442
Ardently they desire that which transcends sense Every misfortune brings its fellow with it Medicines work harm as often as good No good excepting that from which we expect the worst Obstinacy--which he liked to call firm determination Only the choice between lying and silence Patronizing friendliness Principle of over-estimating the strength of our opponents Provide yourself with a self-devised ruler Successes, like misfortunes, never come singly The beginning of things is not more attractive

 UARDA,







 by Georg Ebers, v5
[GE#05][ge05v10.txt]5443
Ask for what is feasible I know that I am of use Like the cackle of hens, which is peculiar to Eastern women Think of his wife, not with affection only, but with pride Those whom we fear, says my uncle, we cannot love

 UARDA,







 by Georg Ebers, v6
[GE#06][ge06v10.txt]5444
Her white cat was playing at her feet Human sacrifices, which had been introduced into Egypt by the Phoenicians The dressing and undressing of the holy images Thought that the insane were possessed by demons Use words instead of swords, traps instead of lances

 UARDA,







 by Georg Ebers, v7
[GE#07][ge07v10.txt]5445
Age when usually even bad liquor tastes of honey How easy it is to give wounds, and how hard it is to heal Kisra called wine the soap of sorrow No one so self-confident and insolent as just such an idiot The mother of foresight looks backwards

 UARDA,







 by Georg Ebers, v8
[GE#08][ge08v10.txt]5446
An admirer of the lovely color of his blue bruises Called his daughter to wash his feet Desert is a wonderful physician for a sick soul He is clever and knows everything, but how silly he looks now If it were right we should not want to hide ourselves None of us really know anything rightly One falsehood usually entails another Refreshed by the whip of one of the horsemen

 UARDA,







 by Georg Ebers, v9
[GE#09][ge09v10.txt]5447
He who looks for faith must give faith I have never deviated from the exact truth even in jest Learn early to pass lightly over little things Trustfulness is so dear, so essential to me

 UARDA,







 by Georg Ebers, v10 [GE#10][ge10v10.txt]5448
Drink of the joys of life thankfully, and in moderation It is not seeing, it is seeking that is delightful The man within him, and not on the circumstances without

 AN EGYPTIAN PRINCESS,

[GE#12][ge12v10.txt]5450
Did the ancients know anything of love Folly to fret over what cannot be undone Go down into the grave before us (Our children) He who kills a cat is punished (for murder) In those days men wept, as well as women Lovers delighted in nature then as now Multitude who, like the gnats, fly towards every thing brilliant Olympics--The first was fixed 776 B.C. Papyrus Ebers Pious axioms to be repeated by the physician, while compounding Romantic love, as we know it, a result of Christianity True host puts an end to the banquet Whether the historical romance is ever justifiable

 AN EGYPTIAN PRINCESS,
by Georg Ebers, v2
[GE#13][ge13v10.txt]5451
Avoid excessive joy as well as complaining grief Cast off all care; be mindful only of pleasure Creed which views life as a short pilgrimage to the grave Does happiness consist then in possession Happiness has nothing to do with our outward circumstances In our country it needs more courage to be a coward Observe a due proportion in all things One must enjoy the time while it is here Pilgrimage to the grave, and death as the only true life Robes cut as to leave the right breast uncovered The priests are my opponents, my masters Time is clever in the healing art We live for life, not for death

 AN EGYPTIAN PRINCESS,
by Georg Ebers, v3
[GE#14][ge14v10.txt]5452
A kind word hath far more power than an angry one Abuse not those who have outwitted thee Cannot understand how trifles can make me so happy Confess I would rather provoke a lioness than a woman Curiosity is a woman's vice I cannot .
.
.
Say rather: I will not In this immense temple man seemed a dwarf in his own eyes Know how to honor beauty; and prove it by taking many wives Mosquito-tower with which nearly every house was provided Natural impulse which moves all old women to favor lovers Sent for a second interpreter Sing their libels on women (Greek Philosophers) Those are not my real friends who tell me I am beautiful Young Greek girls pass their sad childhood in close rooms

A knot can often be untied by daylight Abandon to the young the things we ourselves used most to enjoy An old war horse, though harnessed to the plough Ancient custom, to have her ears cut off As soon as a white thread could be distinguished from a black one Better place if there were neither masters nor servants Caught the infection and had to laugh whether she would or no Gave them a claim on your person and also on your sorrows Hatred and love are the opposite ends of the same rod He was made to be plundered How could they find so much pleasure in such folly In whom some good quality or other may not be discovered Life is not a banquet Life is a function, a ministry, a duty Love has two faces: tender devotion and bitter aversion Of two evils it is wise to choose the lesser Old age no longer forgets; it is youth that has a short memory Prepared for the worst; then you are armed against failure Sea-port was connected with Medina by a pigeon-post See with agonizing clearness what he had lost in her Self-interest and egoism which drive him into the cave So hard is it to forego the right of hating Spoilt to begin with by their mothers, and then all the women Talk of the wolf and you see his tail Temples of the old gods were used as quarries The man who avoids his kind and lives in solitude Thin-skinned, like all up-starts in authority Those who will not listen must feel Use their physical helplessness as a defence Who can hope to win love that gives none Who can take pleasure in always seeing a gloomy face? Women are indeed the rock ahead in this young fellow's life You have a habit of only looking backwards

What is life but waiting? Waiting is the merchant's wisdom Wakefulness may prolong the little term of life War is a perversion of nature We live for life, not for death We quarrel with no one more readily than with the benefactor We each and all are waiting We've talked a good deal of love with our eyes already Welcome a small evil when it barred the way to a greater one Were we not one and all born fools Wet inside, he can bear a great deal of moisture without What had formerly afforded me pleasure now seemed shallow What changes so quickly as joy and sorrow What are we all but puny children? What father does not find something to admire in his child Whatever a man would do himself, he thinks others are capable of When love has once taken firm hold of a man in riper years When a friend refuses to share in joys When men-children deem maids to be weak and unfit for true sport When hate and revenge speak, gratitude shrinks timidly When you want to strike me again, mother, please take off Whether the form of our benevolence does more good or mischief Whether man were the best or the worst of created beings Whether the historical romance is ever justifiable Who watches for his neighbour's faults has a hundred sharp eyes Who can point out the road that another will take Who can be freer than he who needs nothing Who only puts on his armor when he is threatened Who does not struggle ward, falls back Who gives great gifts, expects great gifts again Who do all they are able and enjoy as much as they can get Who can take pleasure in always seeing a gloomy face? Who can prop another's house when his own is falling Who can hope to win love that gives none Whoever condemns, feels himself superior Whoever will not hear, must feel Wide world between the purpose and the deed Wise men hold fast by the ever young present Without heeding the opinion of mortals Woman who might win the love of a highly-gifted soul (Pays for it) Woman's disapproving words were blown away by the wind Woman's hair is long, but her wit is short Women are indeed the rock ahead in this young fellow's life Wonder we leave for the most part to children and fools Words that sounded kindly, but with a cold, unloving heart Wrath has two eyes--one blind, the other keener than a falcon's Ye play with eternity as if it were but a passing moment Years are the foe of beauty You have a habit of only looking backwards Young Greek girls pass their sad childhood in close rooms Youth should be modest, and he was assertive Youth calls 'much,' what seems to older people 'little' Zeus does not hear the vows of lovers Zeus pays no heed to lovers' oaths

 Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™
 Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from people in all walks of life.
 Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.
 Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
 The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit 501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by U.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.
 The Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to date contact information can be found at the Foundation’s website and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact
 Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
 Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the IRS.
 The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.
 While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who approach us with offers to donate.
 International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
 Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.
 Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
 Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.
 Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.
 Most people start at our website which has the main PG search facility: www.gutenberg.org.
 This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™, including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
